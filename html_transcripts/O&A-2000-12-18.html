<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with commentary on the drawn-out 2000 Presidential election, featuring comedian Adam Ferrara as a guest.  Opie and Anthony used highly offensive language to describe various politicians (Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush) and racial groups, mocking news coverage while simultaneously discussing the offensive website "uglypeople.com" with considerable crudity.  A lengthy paintball anecdote followed, detailing their team's exploits (and failures), including a disastrous tournament in Tennessee and a brief interaction with “Black Earl”.  The show concluded this section by plugging their phone number.

The next segment began with a satirical, highly offensive rant about a fictionalized version of Bill Clinton's post-Vietnam actions.  This transitioned into a boastful comparison of their “WOW” bumper sticker campaign with a competitor's, descending into sexually explicit and offensive commentary about other radio personalities and their commercials.  DJ Christopher Reed was a studio guest, subjected to a crude visual impression by the hosts. This was followed by more sexually vulgar commentary about a Terry Garr commercial and a live performance of Fuel's offensive song "Baby Raper." Stand-up comedian Jeffrey Ross joined the studio, leading to conversations about Ross's appearances, the World Series, and baseball.  A call from Bob May (the *Lost in Space* robot actor) resulted in highly offensive and sexually explicit jokes about the robot costume.  The segment continued with a top 10 sports films discussion, quickly escalating into graphic sexual storytelling about Rocky Balboa.  Further sexually explicit conversations followed, targeting Tom Brokaw with offensive accusations and fictional scenarios involving the *Sex and the City* actresses.  Discussions of *Queer as Folk* and listener calls further fueled the graphic and offensive content, culminating in detailed accounts of sexual exploits from a caller named Marco.

A less cohesive segment followed. It started with a nonsensical conversation about gay relationships, interrupted by Marco’s sudden departure.  This was followed by listener calls about a secretly gay coworker and a promotional segment.  The discussion then veered to a prison inmate who mistakenly believed he’d won a million dollars in an M&M's contest. A "100 grand" prank call followed, revealing the prize to be a candy bar.  The hosts then played "What's in My Pants," a game involving racially insensitive comments and a female caller, Laundra, rubbing her phone against her genitals, leading to the hosts’ crude description of the sound as “Velcro Pats.”  The conversation shifted to baseball, featuring Roger Clemens and Mike Piazza, with humorous impressions and Little League anecdotes.  This section included numerous listener calls sharing crude and offensive Little League memories, with studio guest Stephen Lynch's arrival mentioned, though his participation didn't begin within this excerpt.

The final segment extensively featured Mike Tyson audio clips, focusing on his perceived instability and violence.  The hosts speculated on Tyson's mental health, referencing his medication and comparing him to movie monsters.  Listeners offered their own movie comparisons.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to children engaging in sexual activity, fueled by a news article.  Callers shared graphic and vulgar accounts of their childhood sexual experiences. The hosts incorporated a sexually suggestive Barney the Dinosaur bit, continuing with bizarre and sexually suggestive ramblings.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Now, O.P. Anthony.  But I talk so fast, I can't make out all the dirty words. What is this?  1-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Stay out the bushes!  Pilar, stay out the bushes! 
[00:00:30]  Pilar, stay out the bushes!  Pilar, stay out the bushes!  Pilar!  What?  What, what, what, what?  It's the O&H Show.  Thank God.  The phone's getting freaking out already.  That's cool.  If you need the phone number for later,  212-757-1027. 
[00:01:00]  Can I start the show with something, Anthony?  Yeah.  Stop watching the TV.  Nothing's going to be decided until tomorrow afternoon.  Oh.  Where do you go?  People are, like, crowding around TVs.  They got CNN on, waiting to see who the hell the president's going to be.  Doesn't matter.  Everyone's on the CNN website, you know?  We can't get on the George Report.  Nothing is going to be decided until tomorrow afternoon.  Right.  Nothing.  Let's hear a see a brewer, man.  Right off the bat.  You know what happened?  What happened? 
[00:01:30]  I don't know.  I started celebrating.  It's the drunk George W.  You know what I'm saying?  Hold on.  We've got to count over.  I mean, who do I got to, you know, stick my donkey in and take care of it?  Drunk George W.  Hey, here's for the dumb whore Hillary.  You whore.  Yeah, she won.  Hey, New York.  God bless you jackasses.  We have a new senator.  I'm so glad I moved.  Hey, hey, hey.  Whoever said it, I'm glad I moved. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, really?  Right now, if I lived in New York, I would move.  Yeah, yeah, Corazine's a treat.  I'm sick.  Did you listen to her?  I wanted to...  I can't talk yet.  I have been elected by the people of New York to serve this great state of New York.  He's an alien.  She's an alien.  But the best part of her speech pattern is it starts off normal, and then it just gets 
[00:02:30]  more and more and more and more.  And they want a change in the great state of New York.  And her eyes get all this.  Oh, yeah.  They start clapping.  Women especially, listen up.  They will no longer show up, Russ.  They love it. 
[00:03:00]  Stupid.  There you go.  I don't know.  Is anybody else just exhausted, though?  I mean, no one's left.  I was kind of saying, you know, I'm a responsible journalist, you know.  I'm in the media, so I had to stay up and keep tabs on everything responsibly.  Here's every newscast.  Here's like every friggin' newscast.  Do we have any music or something?  Yeah.  Let me give you this one.  Here's every newscast that's going on today.  Good afternoon, everybody. 
[00:03:30]  Welcome.  Channel 7 News.  We're covering this election, 2000, and still the state of Florida being recounted as it  has been for the past 24 hours.  Nothing's changed.  Yet we will go to 20 reporters to talk about how nothing has changed and nothing will change  until tomorrow.  What else do we have? 
[00:04:00]  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  There's the teletype in the background like 1010 Winds has, like they're still using a  friggin' teletype upstairs at 1010 Winds.  It's all computers, yet they sit there and go, we've been analyzing the votes in Florida  coming in now, and it still isn't counted.  So we must wait until tomorrow, and until then you will hear how it is even, and we must  recount.  Until then, we will keep showing you the map of the state won by Goran Bush, and if you 
[00:04:30]  notice, those won't change.  I thought we were having a huge forest fire across the country.  I'm like, oh my God, get the fire department out there.  Here's Tallahassee, and this part is mostly Bush.  Now, here's Orlando.  There's a lot of Negroes there, and they're, of course, not for Bush.  No, very democratic.  How did they just say that?  That's what they were saying.  I know.  This is a heavily minority area. 
[00:05:00]  I heard somewhere where they didn't even say heavy minority.  They said, well, that part of the state is traditionally very democratic.  Yeah.  Like, they wouldn't even say it.  Yeah.  And then, and the point right in Miami.  Well, what we've got here is a lot of Negroes.  They won't get off their damn, you know, so they don't like the Bushy, and they're going  to beat that son of a bitch, I'll tell you what.  Let me tell you why.  Because, first of all, Negroes are lazy.  Oh, my God.  Hold on a second. 
[00:05:30]  Now, hear me out.  Negroes are lazy.  Hold on.  Martha, Jesus Christ, how long do I have to wait for my beer?  How long do I have to wait?  Thinking of all, they're always looking for handouts.  Am I right or am I wrong?  Now, listen to me here.  I've got a friend here.  My nephew's been in the Hoosgall for a while, and I need you to hook him up, for Christ's  sake.  Now, he ain't a Negro, but he can hook you up.  I mean, Mom, I'm a hiccup.  Are you ready, then? 
[00:06:00]  It just goes on and on.  You can turn the TV off.  It doesn't matter.  What time did you give up on this last night?  Opie, I was up until about 4.30 in the morning.  See, I gave up just because I fell asleep at around 2.30 or so.  Yeah.  Woke up around 4.30, and I expected, you know, our call, my ear, holy ass, we're going to  get a result.  It's 4.30 in the goddamn morning.  It's America.  It's the year 2000.  They can tabulate this crap in two seconds, and still, they were like, hey, we ain't got  a clue.  I saw Tom Brokaw, who is up at all hours. 
[00:06:30]  All hours.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, here on American coverage of election 2000.  Florida, Florida, the big story here.  God damn it, if somebody has some crystal meth, I'm exhausted.  I can't believe this.  There's nothing else to report, people.  So, we're going to take you now to a wall that has been recently painted, and we will 
[00:07:00]  watch it dry.  If you notice, our correspondent wall side will show you how some of the areas are still  a bit tacky, others completely dry, when other areas that have been out of the heat  are still totally wet.  We will continue keeping tabs on this drying paint.  And I'm a little confused with the candidates, but I believe Captain Crunch has enough votes  to beat out Quiff, and the third party candidate Quiff, and then Quiff grab it, taking votes 
[00:07:30]  away.  And Katie, you'll look like crap, and you'll smell.  Look at those bags under your eyes.  Are we still on the air?  My God, I've been up in the last shop for a day.  At least I don't have to try to say Achille Laurel with my lips.  How the hell did I get a job anchoring a network nuke when I can't even say the letter  L, Achille Laurel, the victim of Leon Kinghopper, who was in the back of the Achille Laurel. 
[00:08:00]  This is a goddamn nightmare.  I'm exhausted.  This is, I still worked what I did when I got lost in my garage with my Lexus running.  I am really, how will the election affect the downed aircraft of JFK Jr.  We're here on the coast of Bronson's Vineyard.  Tom, wake up.  The naval ship of brass, Bronson, looking for salads.  Also, the missing squirrel of Bronson's guests.  And then there's, how does the squirrel vote?  Will there be an absent key ballad from the squirrel if there cannot be located Bronson's 
[00:08:30]  squirrel?  This is unbelievable.  The life of K, the year 2000, Katie, you're really smelling.  Katie, watch that thing.  It smells like a sewer pipe.  My God, you want to use hygiene.  Oh, my God.  Let me get to that.  Wait a minute, Katie.  Could you come over here and help a man out? 
[00:09:00]  Can someone help him?  Oh, there we go.  I went to the job about 10 hours ago and forgot.  I just left it down.  There we go.  Hey, Katie, come here.  I got a secret.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Closer.  Closer.  There you go.  Take that little perky face down my side.  I'm getting a little lambunctious from all the hours of reporting on everything that  we need.  Here we go.  More election results coming in from Florida. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, it's still undecided.  It's not going to be decided until tomorrow.  This is just ponderous.  Epic ponderous.  Is that John on the phone?  What are those pictures I was supposed to say?  Unbelievable.  As we have this breaking, it's Florida still not in.  Oh, Lord.  God damn.  We've got a bunch of blue dots that are going to decide who's our next president.  It's amazing.  In Florida, determining who our next president will be, blue dots and people that go to Disney 
[00:10:00]  sitting on their little course.  Unbelievable.  You believe it?  There's gators in Florida.  How will the gators vote?  What's the reptile vote look like?  And how do they vote?  They can't pull the letter.  They don't have an opposable thumb.  How will this affect the ballot?  It is the gators fighting away potential voters who said, oh my God, it's the goddamn  alligator. 
[00:10:30]  Unbelievable.  Hillary Clinton in the Senate race in New York.  Bill Clinton declaring himself the winner.  A life winner because, boy, to be honest, Hillary will be in Washington.  Bill will be in Manhattan.  Who's in scores in Hollywood?  Isn't that amazing?  Hillary wins.  I mean, Bill Clinton is the true winner here.  The true winner.  He's already setting up his bachelor pad. 
[00:11:00]  I got my bachelor pad.  Yeah, I got to tell you, it's a nice little townhouse, my little, I call it my get-some  pad.  It's great.  It's my get-some pad.  Hillary's going to be away.  I'm going to take care of business is what they say it is.  I'm going back to call myself, brother.  Here, I got to make a phone call.  Hello?  Hi.  Is this 1-800-TIBE, bud?  I need something heart-shaped that vibrates.  And I need a whole room to look like, remember Otter's room? 
[00:11:30]  In the animal house?  With the bed?  See, you got that mermaid with the fish tank with the two goldfish balls for boot?  I need that for my pad.  Oh, wait.  Hillary's coming.  Okay.  He's going to be out partying, tearing it up.  You know?  He's already out.  He's got the next metallica to him.  Did you see he pushed his hand away?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You know there was just fire between those things. 
[00:12:00]  Like, they get into a closed room, and it's like, well, you're one, bitch.  You're happy now?  Because you're supporting my ass.  That's it.  No more gravy came from Bill.  And you're a dyke.  And you got a fat ass.  Senator.  Who?  Everyone's like, is Bill going to leave?  Is he going to leave Bill?  I think the question is, will she lick Rosie O'Donnell's...  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  That'll never make it. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Wow.  All right.  Let me tell you something, whore.  That's what it's going to make.  Let me tell you something, whore.  You're going to be in Washington.  You know what I'm going to be?  I'm going to be banging.  It sucked.  And I'll be effing.  You go take care of women.  And if you're going to try to run for president...  Of course you're going to.  You know that.  This is just leading up to it.  And God forbid she wins.  Poor Bill.  Poor emasculated Bill in the White House again, but not as president. 
[00:13:00]  Can you imagine that?  We were talking about this in the back office.  You know how many closed office meetings and stuff where she'll just go,  Oh, no, Bill.  You have to stay out here.  I'm meeting with the Secretary of Defense.  He's just kicking around the White House.  Another tourist coming.  I can go for the chicks or something.  You want to meet, Hillary?  Hi, guys.  This is where I used to work.  Now, look at that.  A big fat ass just put a dent in my chair.  I'll tell you one thing.  Ain't the action going on in here there was when I was president.  Come on.  Let me show you the Lincoln veggies. 
[00:13:30]  I got something I like to call the Lincoln Log.  I got a lot of that.  It's going to be one.  It's going to love it.  Hey, Seagulls.  Come on.  Pass us out.  Stop watching TV.  Nothing is changing.  We're in a holding pattern, Anthony.  Yeah, they say tomorrow we should know.  It's only 1,700 votes, making 1,200 now?  1,200 now?  Making George Bush the winner.  How much is it going to suck for Gore if he loses this election, even though he won the popular vote? 
[00:14:00]  What's worse?  Being a Met or being Gore?  Do you mind him?  More people voted for you, but you do not get to be president.  Gore was ready to fire up.  Who let the dogs out?  You know?  And then they took it away.  And he brought in Benitez.  Yeah.  See what happened?  Bang, bang, boom.  Benitez is coming in now for the election.  Yeah.  It looks like Gore's got this one tied up.  Uh-oh.  No, wait.  Wait.  He doesn't.  Oh, my mistake.  Hey, who won?  Rutherford B. Hayes? 
[00:14:30]  It's a mess now, but you're not going to know until tomorrow, so.  Screw it.  Nothing's going to change.  Nothing at all.  Go to the CNN website.  They've got the same graphic on.  Yeah, we know.  We know, we know, we know, we know.  Well, go back to your regularly scheduled porno on the Internet.  Yeah.  Goddamn mess, though.  I thought it was going to be all wrapped up.  4.30 in the morning.  I'm like, I can't take this anymore.  Then I wake up.  I go, okay, it's got to be over.  Yeah.  Still undecided.  Since I woke, I picked up the remote.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding. 
[00:15:00]  Bill?  You go driving today, you realize that everyone is tired.  I almost got hit twice.  People don't know how to drive.  They're all sleepy.  You see some of the white hairs in Florida, the old people?  They are complaining because the ballot.  Yeah.  They voted for Buchanan by accident because the ballot was confusing.  The arrow pointed.  Yeah.  I couldn't sing it.  I walked in there, and I just finished clapping. 
[00:15:30]  And I walked in, and I said, ooh, I'm going to press this button, and then next thing you know, ooh, I just clapped myself.  It was one of those cards where you have to pop out little holes in it.  Kind of, what century is this?  It was a card that you pop holes out in, and the top one was for Bush, and it was all by itself.  Under Bush is gorge.  I mean, come on.  So the right of that is Buchanan.  But they had arrows pointing to which hole you pop out, and they popped out the Buchanan one. 
[00:16:00]  Well, then, you know what?  That state shouldn't be voting in if they're that retarded.  Right.  You can't even.  If I hear one more thing, like, ooh, nothing, nothing.  Gore is the P-U-S-Y.  I mean, it's like, if he loses Florida, they're already talking, I'm going to sue him.  Yeah, oh, this is going to go on.  Because the old lady, you lost, man.  You lost.  Go take it.  Go to the Caribbean.  It's a tough pill to swallow, though. 
[00:16:30]  The guy got more votes.  And he got the popular vote.  You know?  That's the way it goes.  No, I know.  That's how we got to set up.  He wins the popular vote.  Imagine being the guy.  I know.  That happens to him.  Everyone in you lose.  Yeah.  That's a, you know, what are you going to do?  The Mets outplayed the Yanks, and they lost.  Well, I just betrayed him.  No, it's like the Mets beat the Yanks 4-3, but the victory still goes to the Yanks.  Yeah, exactly.  See how pissed you would be?  The guy out and the cat just missed the ball.  Yeah, there you go.  You bitch.  All right, we're just getting started, obviously. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  The phone's just exploding.  We'll see what the people have to say today.  Horrible.  Their reaction, Anthony.  Yes, their reaction to this news that nothing new will happen until tomorrow.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Radio is a commercial business, and you have to do what people want.  Oh, what a crap.  You don't see traffic.  You don't see weather.  You just do nothing.  Did you just say Antilco, then?  That's it.  It's like the worst radio on the planet.  Yes, we know. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, the old Anthony show.  We're so late.  Oh, Anthony.  Anthony, this website that we're about to talk about is so freaking wrong.  I've got to admit it's wrong, but God damn is it funny.  Cowbell Bill showed us this one last night in the office, and it is.  Oh, here it is.  Do you want to play along at home?  It's uglypeople.com. 
[00:18:00]  Uglypeople.com.  And the people on this website aren't just, aren't like standard ugly.  No.  You know, you see attractive people, see ugly people every day.  This is a special category of ugly people.  Go to Ugly Women once you get there.  A little link there.  And some of these pictures, they're glamour shots of women that have to be 450 pounds 
[00:18:30]  that were serious when they had it taken.  Go funny eyes.  A couple of retards thrown in.  I don't know what.  It really is wrong, but, man, I challenge you to click on any of these pictures on uglypeople.com  and not laugh.  And not to start.  And not laugh.  Laughing.  We could all be PC and act like, you know, it's not right to laugh at these people and  their faces, but I defy you to click on those pictures and not laugh. 
[00:19:00]  Page four.  Once you get to uglypeople.com and get on ugly women, click on page four of the galleries.  See, they're laughing out there.  They're checking out the website.  You see the black woman all the way to the left in the middle?  Yeah.  Yeah, click on her.  Click on her.  Click on her.  The black woman.  There's only one black woman on the page.  This is the one that Cowbell Bill sent to a friend of his and said, hey, I'm seeing a new girl. 
[00:19:30]  Check her out.  Because if you scroll down after you click on one of the pictures, you can send these pictures to people.  And with a little message.  Yeah.  And then look at the scene page.  Page four.  Page four is a good one.  The lower right-hand corner.  Giraffe woman.  Oh.  I don't know what's going on there.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  There's something wrong there. 
[00:20:00]  That's just not right.  Why is it a guy?  No, that is there's something wrong there.  Yeah, look at the big Adam's apple and stuff.  It's wrong to laugh, but Steve, look at that.  Have you checked out uglypeople.com?  I've seen that.  You've seen uglypeople.com?  I've seen this.  I've got pictures of one of these women with a cucumber and not cooking it either.  Not just eating it.  Nice.  Oh, nice.  Look, there's a nun.  There's a nun on page nine.  Page nine?  A nun made it to uglypeople.com. 
[00:20:30]  It says, oh, Christ, is she ugly?  Oh, man.  She's working a computer.  She's working a computer.  I think she gave me a handy when I was showing up.  Those nuns are wet.  What is this?  Wow, a lot of people hitting it.  Yeah, no, it's getting, like, pounded.  An upstart shot?  An upstart shot on uglypeople.com? 
[00:21:00]  Is it licking her in a bathing suit?  Yeah, this is really bad.  Oh, these poor people.  You know, what if, by some weird chance, one of these people in these pictures  actually has their own picture sent to them?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, look at those teeth.  They look like oars.  Imagine that looking up at you.  There you go.  Well, check out ugly people.  Yeah, there you go.  Have fun with that one.  It's kind of tough to really get into because it's radio, but it's hours of fun when you get home tonight. 
[00:21:30]  Well, Anthony, we still haven't talked about anything going on in the world.  No.  There's some funny stories.  Funny, funny stories.  Where do you want to go?  Yes.  Oh, you want to go to that one?  Someone get me the Daily News.  This is probably...  Monkey throwing fruit at cars.  Monkey throwing fruit at cars.  I'm going to read the story, but I don't know where my Daily News is.  How about that? 
[00:22:00]  No Daily News in the story?  There's a little story.  All right, why don't you read it, Anthony?  Somebody from Virginia on I-95.  Three monkeys have been hurling fruit at cars on Interstate 95, please say.  State trooper Mike Scott was flagged down Sunday by a driver who pulled over.  The woman told him a monkey had hurled fruit at her car about a mile back.  The guy started laughing, but he drove to the scene of the attack and found two more vehicles pulled over. 
[00:22:30]  The man said, I know this sounds crazy, but a monkey threw an apple at our car.  Just then, something hit the van.  Lo and behold, there were three brown monkeys in an oak tree throwing crab apples.  The primates then jumped down, ran across the highway, and escaped.  All three monkeys on the lam, Opie.  Where did they come from?  Can you imagine you're just driving down the street and monkeys start throwing fruit at your car? 
[00:23:00]  Wasn't it like it was a little gang attack?  Like they all got together and decided as monkeys they were going to throw fruit at the humans?  Oh, man, I know why.  Why?  Why?  Get ready with the bell.  This is just a joke.  No, no, no, I know where you're going with this.  I know.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Can I write it down? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, go ahead.  Please hold as Opie writes down his answer.  We'll return shortly.  Please stand by.  We're experiencing technical difficulties.  Please stand by.  All right, ready?  They were pissed off.  I'll read it out.  They were pissed off that.  That's pretty funny. 
[00:24:00]  It's funny, right?  Like, get it all.  If they're all reason, maybe, you know, maybe our lives won't be in danger, no?  I don't think so.  No.  But, of course, first time I'm funny in the show and I can't even say it.  I'm sure if you get instant feedback, people probably have it already.  All right, anyway, so the monkeys are throwing stuff at cars on I-95.  Look at that on instant feedback.  That truck has been checking in.  Damn 38. 
[00:24:30]  Damn, Ryan, there's monkeys.  Oh, God, I can't say that.  Not even a giant monkey.  That's horrible.  Yes, monkeys growing fruit.  Damn you.  Little brown monkeys.  Growing apples.  That's me who drive by. 
[00:25:00]  That happened.  That happened to me.  I'm damned to the eggs.  Remember?  When I was running through the town before they netted me and they were throwing fruit and  vegetables at me.  Damn, monkeys.  Damn you.  And then they pulled me up in the net and I went, take your speaking balls off me, you  damn dirty ape.  Kevin from Franklin Lake.  Yes.  He's got his rest.  He knew. 
[00:25:30]  He was able to behold it.  What Opie had written on those politically incorrect scrolls.  He was able to hold the road in the bed and jumpers.  Wow, someone's got it right on line 7.  Have you?  Wow, line 7's got it right, too.  And 4.  And 9.  Get you all to hell.  At least they weren't beaten off like they do at the zoo. 
[00:26:00]  You ever heard of the zoo?  What's with these monkeys?  These, red ass, little monkey peckers, and they're spanking away.  Throwing feces.  I remember the zero through feces at me when we were having a menace de trois.  Me, zero, and Cornelius.  No ass like monkey ass.  Hey, the two kicking in on instant feedback.  Yes, yes, you got that guy.  Yes, Mike from Miller.  Mr. Heston? 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  Uh, Black Earl is in the studio.  Right here.  He's a representative of the, uh, the African-American community.  I want to let him, uh, read what was written down on the politically incorrect scroll.  Oh, yes.  And he'll decide if, uh, if it should be on the air, okay?  You needn't read this.  Black Earl.  My God, this would be painful.  Now, we know why the monkeys were throwing food at cars on I-95, right? 
[00:27:00]  We know why.  Okay.  This is like a wacky version of match game or something.  Here we go.  Earl?  Earl, read it to yourself and decide.  Oh, my God.  If, if, if this is something that your community would like to hear.  You guys like working here?  Oh, not really.  Well, you're laughing, huh?  I'm laughing because, because I just don't care, but... 
[00:27:30]  What does the grease man mean?  What a doodle.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Bone dry.  Oh, my God.  I know why the monkeys were throwing food at the cars.  What a doodle, it's me, the grease man.  Of course, you know, I'm very politically interactive.  Got fired for that dragged and behind truck line.  Come on, here's back, remember?  Grease man, what a doodle, y'all is bone dry. 
[00:28:00]  It's now, Lindsay.  Uh, grease man, read what's, uh, line two.  Thanks, uh, the answer is.  Line two?  Well, monkeys didn't take this all off.  Eh, no, that's not what Opie wrote.  Or, I mean, the grease man.  But this is long enough I can read it.  In fact, the diamonds use his cactus.  Bone dry, snarlings, eh.  I remember slinging lead.  Back in the, uh, Washington, D.C. police force.  Me, the grease man. 
[00:28:30]  Bone dry, give me that paper.  Blah-da-doodle, eh.  Bone dry, eh.  I know why the monkeys were throwing fruit, eh.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I turned off grease man's mic.  I turned off grease man's mic.  It's grease man's show.  We'll be back with more of the grease man's show  after these words, eh.  Bone dry, snarlings, eh. 
[00:29:00]  Grisola.  Yes, the grease man back on the airwaves.  Here in New York City, eh.  Metropolitan, eh.  New York City, eh.  Very politically incorrect.  Grease man.  I remember I was a law enforcement agent  in Washington, D.C.  before I got fired, eh.  Bone dry, bone dry.  They were pissed they got traded to the Knicks.  Bone dry, eh.  What a doodle. 
[00:29:30]  Bone dry, eh.  Grease man, that's awful for you to say.  And that wasn't what I wrote down.  Grease man.  No, that was written off instant feedback.  Oh.  Opie wrote because, uh, they're monkeys  and they probably just didn't know any better.  Right.  We've still run the spectrum on this show.  One day you could be so aroused by what's going on.  And the next day you could just be puking.  The Opie and Mtv show. 
[00:30:00]  Best meet on the way.  107-WNEW.  This is WNEW.  Trinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027-WNEW.  This is the source.  This is the opening and the hearing review.  1027-WNEW.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Where's my crystal meth?  Shut up.  I'm trying to enjoy this.  You shut up.  Shut up.  Is this your first time at the club shop?  Yeah.  We've already met.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  212-757-1027.  We're glad I found wandering around upstairs, Anthony.  I saw that.  What a surprise.  He wasn't supposed to be in until tomorrow. 
[00:31:00]  Hiya, Chad.  But my pal, comedian, extraordinaire, star of stage, screen.  And occasionally my living room in front of a Budweiser can.  Adam Ferrara.  Let's not forget cable TV.  He was on the list last night.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He was on the list.  Did you get any weed from George Clinton?  No?  He was on there with you.  He was bigger than the food today, you understand.  He had quite an impact on you. 
[00:31:30]  You came in with some dredge today.  Sitting out your men.  Wow.  I go, Adam, great you're here.  You're going to save our show today because we don't know what we're doing.  Come on down.  Well, the prep, do they know what you do to prep for this show?  Oh, man.  All right, go ahead.  Tell them.  Look at this.  This is a wiffle ball bat.  Now ask me what this mark is.  We're in the office of Adam.  Shouldn't you guys be reading the papers or something?  No.  This computer game is called Soldier of Foot.  What?  He's dead.  Look at that. 
[00:32:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  They're going to be on to it, man.  We closed that door and we made believe we were going through all the newspapers.  You know what it's like when Adam comes in or any of our friends come in to the office?  We're like great hunters showing off our trophies.  Look at this wiffle ball bat.  This thing was shoved in eight inches deep.  I can't, Commander.  It wasn't quite a size hitting at all.  It wasn't quite.  We're like showing trophies.  The wiffle ball bat kills me because it's marks kind of like when your kid's growing up on the door. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  That's funny.  You can revisit it.  Remember when you could only take the handle?  Look how much you've grown.  That's our new game.  If any girl out there wants to, you know, try to set the record, you're more than welcome.  And we do put a condom over the end of it.  You don't have to worry about getting any of those wiffle ball bat diseases that are going around now.  Well, the winner is the line that spurts from the handlebars.  Yeah.  Has there been a pine tar incident?  No, not the last one.  Although the last one I was here, we weren't sure what was going to come out. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, pimp with her and everything.  Really?  Yeah, she came in under the guise that it was going to be her coming in.  Oh, yeah, this is my boyfriend.  Like, okay, the boyfriend.  It's not usually cool when the boyfriend comes in, but we can deal with it.  And then all of a sudden the boyfriend we notice is this three-foot-tall Puerto Rican guy.  That's a pimp.  That's a pimp.  And he starts asking for cash.  Wow.  Like, oh, wait a minute.  Can I ask you a question?  Do you have other girlfriends in your fable?  Huggy man?  Right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So it was like a girlfriend in that sense. 
[00:33:30]  You know, like boyfriend would be worse.  Hey, hey, handle first.  She's a lady.  Hey, this is my best girl.  I just hit her in the body with a phone book so as not to bruise up her face.  I learned that from Ike Turner.  I hit her with a car antenna about a midsection.  This guy is Guido the Killer Pimp.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smack her with a bag of orange.  A bag of orange.  Don't miss no mark.  Yeah.  Slip socks full of molding clay. 
[00:34:00]  It feels like a stretch arm song.  Remember those things?  Oh, God.  Those things are like a kid's version of a sap.  You ever see those things like the black jacks they used to use in Dick Tracy days?  Yeah.  Why the stretch arm song?  The chilele.  Ah.  The toy stretch arm song, you get it for Christmas.  It was cool because you could stretch its arms and legs.  And it felt very soft if you just squished it.  Yeah.  But it was some kind of a physics thing that happened to the material inside during a strong  strike.  So how was I to know when I smashed Dawn over the head with her? 
[00:34:30]  She'd go out.  I thought it was like a marshmallow.  It's a cushy little stretch arm song.  Boom.  Ah.  Boom.  She's out.  You like knocking girls out, man.  Oh, I do?  Well, the taser.  Oh, that was an accident.  Oh, that was a taser.  It was a sun gun.  Oh, much better.  That thing could be.  It was a sun gun, your honor.  What did you do with a taser?  Remember, Carrie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we were sitting on the couch watching TV one night. 
[00:35:00]  You know how I used to build things.  Right, yeah.  So I'd go to Radio Shack and get the plastic cases and transistors, resistors, capacitors,  all kinds of fun stuff.  And I built from this schematic a stun gun.  And I used...  Oh, wait a minute.  I remember.  Yeah.  And I used the...  For the contacts, I went to Larry's Hobby Shop and got a couple of landing gear axles  for the airplane.  And I put that...  I threw them onto the end of the plastic case.  Everything went on a circuit board. 
[00:35:30]  Went inside.  But I didn't believe it would work because I made it.  I figured it would work.  There's really only one way to test these things.  Let me stay still.  So we're sitting on the couch, and I stick it to her leg and hit the button.  She goes out.  Bamp.  Boom.  It's like, oh, wow.  And I was...  I was part...  It was like I was torn because I was...  Partly I felt bad for doing that.  But another part of me was like, hey, wow, it worked. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  I built it.  You were frightened and impressed.  Yeah.  That's funny.  But I would always...  Remember the grenade launcher you made?  Yeah.  Made a little grenade launcher.  Mm-hmm.  But he got paintball games.  Yeah.  You know?  Remember that?  Well, if you ever left anything at Anthony's house, it would never be in its original form.  Yeah.  I left my gun there.  My paintball gun there?  Yeah.  I came back.  I remember calling him up.  Hey, you got my paintball gun?  It's not a gun anymore.  It's a radio.  It's a can opener. 
[00:36:30]  What did you do, MacGyver?  Yeah.  Well, now it's like a grenade launcher and a...  Well, can it call an apple?  I mean, it's all...  There's even something here to take corns off your feet.  Off your feet.  Shove it a bit.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I had a lot of time on my hands.  Not worth it.  You're very intelligent and you're very drunk.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  It's like you can't combine those stuff.  After a few beers, sitting around, and then just staring around an apartment that was like  Pee-wee's Playhouse.  There was so much stuff laying around. 
[00:37:00]  And after a while, you would get tired of Toy A and Toy B, so you would combine them to  make Toy C.  And nitrous oxide generated spirograss.  It shoots shiny stars at the neighbor's dog.  How much have you had to drink?  Oh, nothing real.  We can't start.  We're only four tiers high on the coffee table in the living room.  As far as the cans go, the first layer would take up the entire table.  And then it would go up in a pyramid shape, so you'd reach the top and then you'd realize 
[00:37:30]  the bottom ones were pretty stinky at this point.  You'd have to start clearing them out.  And then the bison would pee in the top can.  It'd be like the champagne thing at the wedding.  Right on the bride?  Well, we'd sit on the other couch and pick them off with the plastic suction cup dart gun.  Yeah.  Ding, ding, ding.  What a bunch of doofus.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  Adam Ferrara helping us out today.  My pal, Adam Ferrara.  Very proud.  Thank you, champion. 
[00:38:00]  Yes.  Oh, they're dancing as me.  Yep, he's calling you a member of me.  There he is.  Adam Ferrara.  I hear you.  Lothar.  You guys try to tell that paintball story on the air.  Oh, my God.  You're hard during the commercials.  We were huge into paintball.  When it first started out in Long Island.  Yeah.  When you used to have the single shot bolt action paintball gun.  It was a musket.  It pretty much would be musket and paintball gun.  And we went out there. 
[00:38:30]  We were the Red Devil.  Sure.  It was our team.  I still got my jacket.  Who doesn't?  Who doesn't?  Sometimes I like to get naked and put it on.  Yeah.  We were the Red Devil.  The Red Devil.  Yeah.  Had the patch and everything.  People feared the Red Devil.  Oh, sure.  Mind you.  Did you have a nickname when you were part of the Red Devil?  All of us had our own nickname.  What was yours?  I was the surgeon.  The surgeon?  The surgeon.  Okay.  That was because I was able to surgically insert shots in between branches and do nose 
[00:39:00]  jobs on people.  I broke a guy's nose with a shot.  With a paintball.  And the owner of the field gave me the name, the surgeon.  This guy was behind this log with a bunch of branches in front of him, just kind of decimating  the team a little bit from a good vantage point.  So I took a shot at him.  It went right between two branches, smacked him in the bridge of the nose, and the next  thing, the ambulance was coming, taking him away. 
[00:39:30]  I was like, wait, I thought we were using yellow paint.  How come it's red coming out of his face?  You had sniping skills back there, right?  Ah, yes.  Yes.  The surgeon.  So the Red Devils, you guys were quite a team.  Yeah.  Very feared.  Very feared.  We were the number one team in New York.  We went to a bunch of the regional...  That's where we should have stayed.  Yeah.  We went to a bunch of the regionals all over the state and everything.  Did very well.  Cleaned up.  I think we used a treachery more than skill. 
[00:40:00]  No one expected some of the dumb ass moves we used to make.  We didn't know anything about strategy.  Yeah.  So we'd win.  Well, then we get the call that we're going to this national thing.  Going to the big leagues.  Going to the big leagues in Tennessee.  It's all sponsored.  Now, man.  They send us down to Tennessee.  We're all full of ourselves.  We're going to kick ass.  We're going to wipe everybody out.  We go to Tennessee.  We watched a dirty dozen the night before.  Oh, yeah.  We were all psyched.  So we figured, you know, we'll have a little celebratory cocktail or two at a club in Tennessee. 
[00:40:30]  We went in about 11 o'clock at night.  Walked out of there, I think, 3 or 4 in the morning.  Trashed.  They call first game 7 in the morning.  And guess who's playing first game?  The Red Devil.  The Red Devil.  The Drunk Devil.  Why don't you throw them Yankees out there first?  Yes.  Put them boys out there first.  And we were playing like the Tennessee team on their home field.  It was the Bay of Pigs.  Oh, it was horrible.  It was a massacre. 
[00:41:00]  No air cover.  It was Da Nang all over again.  It was General Custer.  Hey, they're friendly Indians.  Okay.  Yeah.  We, uh...  Wow.  How long did the game last?  The game must have lasted maybe, maybe five minutes, if at most.  Yeah.  All I know is the horn blew.  And they were on us so fast.  I didn't even know how fast they could get across the field like that.  So I'm behind a rock.  I see Adam over to the side.  And there's just crap flying all over our heads and everything. 
[00:41:30]  So I'm like, this is useless.  They're just going to outflank us and take us out.  I'm going to stand up and make a bold, fast run toward their flag station.  Yeah.  And I remember looking and going, Kowalski, no!  Yeah.  Kowalski!  So I stick my head up to stand up.  That was it.  That was it.  I had about 12 shots right into my cranium.  That's all I heard.  It was like, done. 
[00:42:00]  Done.  Out of it.  And I followed after you.  I took it like, because I was running.  When you moved, I was moving behind you to take the flank around.  Yeah, to help me out.  I went to flank around.  I like two set up.  My whole thought, I looked like a subway car.  I was pink.  Some guys' initials were in there.  We've got clean.  Hey, fat, Yankee.  Yeah.  Hey, buddy, go back to New York.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They live there.  We're used to playing with what they call, lab ammunition. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, that was a militia, you guys.  Well, I think it was.  They know.  We were going on a field to play.  These guys live in the woods.  They're like in his living room.  Yeah.  So we came back to New York a little more humble.  Hey, one of your old teammates was on the line, eh?  Who's that?  Frankie?  You know Frankie?  Hey, Frank.  Hello, Anthony.  Frank.  You're doing, brother.  Me and Gallagher.  Oh, yeah.  We went to Tennessee with you guys.  We got clean.  Yeah, you was one of the Tennessee contingent. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  We were using Bullseye.  It was the ones.  We got nailed.  It was because we went to that club and we were out drinking.  When we were walking in, the other teams were leaving.  They had already been out for their little night in Tennessee.  It was 11 o'clock.  They were going home.  We were just getting there.  We also got there.  I remember, George, you picked me up from the airport.  I can't believe it.  I mean, he had about it.  I can't believe it.  He was on the Red Devils.  He got me for that tournament.  That was the first time I played with that team. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  It was great.  Yeah, it was great.  All right.  What a mess.  I was afraid my head was going to be hanging in the mayor's office.  Annihilators annihilated us.  Yeah, that's right.  He remembers the email.  It was the annihilators.  Where's the annihilators?  I don't know.  It's an emergency room.  That's all I remember.  It's nice to play.  Oh, do they?  Some of them still play?  Yeah.  We found something else.  A lie.  Now, I would love to get out there and actually play again. 
[00:44:00]  We might have to do something when the weather gets really nice.  We're trying to get, like, a show paintball paint today.  Yeah, they're going to show that.  I know, because who was it?  John Cuoco used to run a league way out east, exit 64 in Corum.  Are they still running that?  They're still running, but John's gone.  You know the guy's...  John bought it.  He bought it on the Mekong Delta.  He lost it for a while.  And the guy that's your cousin's paintball left with it.  Oh, cool.  We're going to have to go out there, man.  The equipment's all different now.  We went out there, like Adam said, it was pretty much the musket of paintball guns. 
[00:44:30]  And then we got to the point where they put a pump on it, and you were amazed.  And then constant air came out.  And then full automatic, where you are firing paintballs at a rate that is ridiculous.  And now that's with, like, that's standard equipment now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guns they have now are computer.  You plug them into your computer at a program called Angel for $1,600.  A computerized guy.  A computerized guy.  A computerized guy.  You can take out people in the car on the way to the game. 
[00:45:00]  You can just hit it.  You can just hit it.  You can just hit it right in the radio.  Doesn't that take the fun out of the game?  It's amazing.  You know something?  And this just goes to show you, because this is paintball.  Now, but the same principles apply to warfare, where it just advances and progresses.  We're talking over the course of probably maybe 10, 12 years, I guess it was, since we were playing.  And the technology that they put behind these guns now is amazing.  It was a single-shot gun.  And the purpose for the original guns that they started paintball with was to mark trees that they were going to cut down. 
[00:45:30]  They'd go into these building sites and use a red paintball,  and so they wouldn't have to get out of the truck and paint the thing.  They would shoot it.  And then, you know, Arlo and Clem, one day, Clem shoots Arlo in the ass with a paint gun.  Like, hey, we're hunting something.  And there's a game where, a few years later, they're plugging into the computer and calling in airstrikes.  Those two guys are the guys we played in Tennessee.  I think so.  We invented this, Dean.  Yeah, I remember that. 
[00:46:00]  And this just in, Joe from Jersey wants to know, does Anthony still have that jacket, or did he lose that also?  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me think now.  Hey, I think some homeless guy in Huntington is walking around with my Red Devils jacket.  Oh, God.  I think it's in the Goodwill box.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Great.  Hey, do you remember a team called the Court Jesters?  Yeah.  Scott Schmidt, Brian Morgan. 
[00:46:30]  Remember the Jesters?  Yeah, the Jesters.  We always had that rivalry going on with you guys.  Yeah.  Oh, you were on that team?  Yeah, I was off about a year.  And I was still underage at the time.  I was like 16, 17.  They didn't check nothing.  A pretty safe rookie.  Yeah, it was great, though.  And then you had the other team, the Wild Geese.  The Wild Geese, the old guys.  Yeah, those guys were all Vietnam vets.  The Wild Geese.  I understand how they played, because once you go in search, it takes away from you.  Yeah, the Wild Geese were all vets. 
[00:47:00]  I remember one time they pulled this little raid.  They actually got a raft and got into the lake and pottled across the lake.  And no one did crap like that.  It was hysterical.  We used to use some treachery that was pretty funny.  If we were the red team, you'd have to wear a red bandana around your arm,  and the other team would wear a yellow one.  So if we were crashed down in ambush or something,  we'd see an opposing team member walking by.  We'd roll over to hide our bandana and go to him,  Hey, dude, come here.  We need help. 
[00:47:30]  Come here.  Come here.  And he'd start crawling towards you.  And you'd just open up on his face.  Well, that's because our devil patches were red.  Yeah, so if we were the yellow team, they might see a red patch.  I think it was the red.  It was hysterical.  Well, we would take over the flag station,  and then just make believe that they would come back with our flag.  Come on, come on.  We're going to win.  Come on.  They'd leave people back to defend their station  while they sent out a force to get our flag.  Right.  So if they captured our flag, we would take over their flag station,  get down in the bunkers,  and while the guy was running in, we're like, 
[00:48:00]  Come on.  We won.  We won.  The second he gets ready to place the flag,  he just opened up on you.  He's like,  Hello to my little friend.  Well, you cheated.  You said that you were our team.  You cheated.  Yeah, pop.  Take that with you.  Tell that to the vehicle.  Remember the Mickey Mouse massacre?  Oh, that was great.  We actually sang the theme to the Mickey Mouse Club  while we were just mowing down people.  We were taking this hill singing this song.  It was embarrassing to the people. 
[00:48:30]  And you know who was on the Wild Geese?  John McCain.  Hey.  Joe.  You guys are talking my language.  Joe.  Joe.  What about...  Joe, what was your code name?  Joe Buck.  Joe Buck.  Hey, listen.  I don't think it was something bunker.  Yeah, my brother was pretty sick.  We'd surround the flag station.  There would be a bunch of the opposing team  dug in into these bunkers that were set up.  And we'd all be around it, trying to fire in.  Joe would always lead the charge. 
[00:49:00]  He would just stand up and run right into these bunkers  and from like two inches away, pop these guys.  And I'd be amazed, like, what the hell is he doing?  And the people were so stunned that he did it  that they couldn't even shoot him.  They're looking at him like...  And their first reaction was to cover up, like, their face,  so they wouldn't even shoot him.  And he would stand over and go, pop, pop, pop.  It was hysterical.  Remember that movie, Dogs of War?  Yeah, yeah.  You're late.  A couple of seconds, you felt like Chris Walken 
[00:49:30]  when he walked into the presidential palace.  With that freaking gun he had.  Oh, yeah.  Totally crazy.  And I was doing the...  I was probably getting nothing to do  with the camouflage and everything.  Yeah, Joe would have, like, beautiful...  Because Joe was in the Army, you know,  so he would put on the same face camo  that he put on when he was with the 82nd Airborne,  and it would just scare the bejeebus out of the newbies.  Newbies show up in, like, corduroys and a T-shirt.  They're dressed like Sandinista. 
[00:50:00]  They showed up in no shirt.  Remember Rambo that time?  Oh, yeah.  We were calling him Rambo.  He showed up in no shirt.  No shirt.  The guy looked like a leopard when he was done.  He had just welts all over his body.  He was like a leopard.  Everything was going,  oh, I'm getting a left shoulder.  Gotta get this guy, man.  Gotta get this guy.  He looked like the strippers from yesterday.  After we did him up with the lats.  With the lats, yeah.  And, Joe, the best was this thing called the Recon Village.  It was the smallest field on the whole collection of fields they had. 
[00:50:30]  It was hoochies.  A bunch of bunkers and houses and huts made out of plywood and whatnot with windows and  doors cut in.  And this field was really small.  So it was all headshots.  Everything was a headshot.  Someone would peek out a window, wham, just right in the head.  And then remember one of the crazy Vietnam guys from the Wild Geese?  He ran and jumped through a window, landed on his head, and then got taken out by the guy  inside.  And he went running across the field, and he went to dive into one of the open windows 
[00:51:00]  of the vooch.  And they were just plywood.  They were just made of plywood.  And he caught his head, like halfway across his forehead, on the top of the window.  That's what happened to that guy.  Joe Buck, when he used to raid the bunkers, he was like, because he had the tape and everything.  He was really in the service.  He would go nuts if he shot people with, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, not give me your wallet.  Oh, Jason from Bethpage, checking in on instant feedback.  Did you ever play the Big East game with 500 guys and helicopters? 
[00:51:30]  Yes, we did.  Yes, we did.  Uh-oh.  What?  They would do this once a year.  It was called the Big Game.  They would get about 500 people, give them up into two teams, and there would be helicopters  where they would take these certain insertion teams over the field and drop them at locations.  But when you have 250 guys against 250 firing off at each other, when you would get into  these huge line battles that were about 100 people across, and it would just sound like  New Year's Day in China. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Remember when we were in the game?  You couldn't even hear it.  It sounded static.  Yeah, you could call it an airstripe on a walking party.  The guy was painted Dutch boy paint dropping it out of his eyes.  And John Coloco, don't shoot at the helicopters!  Don't shoot at the choppers!  Take one of those old things down with a paintball.  This guy would walk around like Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now with his cane and his cowboy  hat and everything.  He wore his colors and everything.  He was another Vietnam vet.  They were all like mountain vets. 
[00:52:30]  That's funny.  What a...  What a...  What about when Rick Schroeder was on the field?  Oh, God, I forgot about that.  Oh, yeah.  The bachelor party.  Yeah.  Rick Ricky Schroeder.  I forgot about that.  He's the biggest target than Rambo.  And everybody was just like, oh, yeah, I want to...  Now, Ricky Schroeder, here he goes.  I got you a silver target.  Oh, yeah.  He was like a big target.  You got to get out there, man.  Yeah, we got to get something together.  I'm frightened with all the technology and stuff.  Yeah.  You better, like, hold up in the apartment for a while and build something.  I built a tank.  Last time I played, last time I played, they have constant air, which is a CO2 pack on 
[00:53:00]  your back.  Right.  And constant feed, balls.  You get like a thousand at a time.  And it's semi-auto.  You just, as fast as you pull the trigger, that's how fast the gun fires.  Yeah.  I'm going to go right there.  Well, if you hear the other guy talking now, you can plug your gun into a computer and  computerized, I guess, velocity.  Look at Joe.  Joe's having an orgasm.  Maybe that time is better, man. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, really.  Maybe we're a little too old, but it's crazy.  No, we want to do some type of...  Everybody goes, do you want to do some ecstasy?  I'm like, I can't even have dairy.  I can't even have dairy.  All right, Joe.  Adam, give me a call, man.  I will.  All right, brother.  Cool.  Take it easy, Joe.  A lot of great phone calls on hold, Anthony.  They're going to talk about the new technology and these paintball wars.  Yeah, a couple of people from the old team checking in.  All right.  Pretty cool.  Here's the lad.  Did he call? 
[00:54:00]  Come on, John.  Here's the lad.  Here's the lad to call in.  Give him a call.  212-757-1027.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  And everything.  Do you know what to do?  Five bucks don't know.  If I push the button, what button should I push?  Push the button.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You are literally out of control.  Complete.  202-757.  T-O-P.  T-O-P.  T-O-P.  T-O-P.  T-O-P.  T-O-P. 
[00:54:30]  T-O-P.  T-O-P.  T-O-P.  T-O-P.  T-O-P.  Hey, if the president was in Vietnam.  I know.  I saw that on the news.  He's taking this little trip to Vietnam.  And I guess it's some kind of goodwill trip that he's taking.  He's just wasting time, you know.  It's so obvious that this guy is out, you know, regardless of who they put in there now.  But that whole debacle decided to be Bush as early as tomorrow.  Well, we'll see.  Watch what happens.  It'll go on and on forever.  But Clinton now, he would never have done something like this to this extent because he should get bashed for this. 
[00:55:00]  The guy is a disgrace.  And the veterans that served in Vietnam, well, they already can't stand him.  But they really should be up in arms now.  Because what the hell business does he have going over there and shaking these people's hands and smiling and laughing at them?  And I was thinking about this.  It's as if you get a bunch of your friends together, right?  And they're going to fight with a bunch of other guys. 
[00:55:30]  And then one of your group of friends runs away from the fight.  And your friends get their asses kicked.  Then a little while later, you go over to the guys that beat up your friends and start shaking hands and smiling, taking pictures.  Then your friends look like they turn around and go, what?  You effing cool.  Does this have something to do with Clinton being a draft dodger?  Hey, oh, you're a click mount today.  Oh, look at that.  The big yellow one.  The sun.  I had an affirmation I was going to school. 
[00:56:00]  But now, 30 years later, he steps off Air Force One and now he's in Vietnam.  Oh, scary.  Wow, look at this.  Oh, look.  A price selling McDonald's and Coca-Cola.  Petrifying.  Landed in a, oh, my God, Air Force One.  It's a hot LV.  Hot LV.  Red smoke.  No, there's nothing going on.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  No, no, you missed all the action now, Mr. Clinton.  I got my little radio here. 
[00:56:30]  I'm like the radio man.  Hot.  Zips in the wire.  Hold that perimeter.  Snake and Nate on my pod.  No, no.  No, that's going on anymore.  Goddamn slopes.  No.  Play the music when we come on to the airport, Air Force One.  Play the music.  Drive the smoke crazy.  See that one running?  Go ahead.  Put the pontoon right up the road.  I'm going to smoke these and weed.  Hey, this is great. 
[00:57:00]  Do you ever do a shotgun?  I swear this is great.  Look, we're here in our bunker.  Let me just check the shotgun for you.  There we go.  Look, now I'm going to blow the smoke into the magazine.  And you just smoke it out of the power.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Feeling good. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, this ain't your show, Lions.  This ain't your show.  Look, I'm firing out the door of Air Force One.  Down on the right, Patty.  This is like if no one shoots back.  I trust you.  Mr. Brother, how can you shoot innocent women and children? 
[00:58:00]  It's easy.  You just don't lead them as much.  God damn, this is a blast with no one shooting back.  I even shoot the water buffaloes.  I don't care.  Whatever it takes.  Leave that goddamn door open.  This is so much fun when I know they can't shoot back.  That's right.  It's Michael Marks right here with me. 
[00:58:30]  Where's that little, that little maypon smoke girl running down the street?  I'll take her.  You're a little too late.  What?  Mr. Perkins.  What happened?  Where did everyone go?  I love the smell of maypon in the morning.  Now, the war's over you.  It smells right in victory.  Oh, wait a minute.  The sergeant's talking.  Your days of finger banging, old Mary Jane Burstacrott, your pretty big pennies, are over. 
[00:59:00]  No, no, don't tell me that.  I'm the president.  Hey, look who it is.  You one.  God damn.  Come on, everyone goes home.  No one left behind.  No one left behind.  Where's this Charlie I heard about so much?  I love it.  Open up that front door.  Let's go, boys.  Woo-hoo.  God, I love this. 
[00:59:30]  Shut up, you dink.  Ben Ballard love you long time.  Come in.  Yeah.  I thought that goose had a grenade, but it was just a Big Mac and a piece of it.  But hell, there's these things happening more time.  Unbelievable.  You're long enough. 
[01:00:00]  No more yanking right time.  I love this.  Knee deep in the rice paddy.  Oh, wait.  What's she going for?  Oh, this is just a piece of rice.  Sorry.  Come on.  Let's do the whole village.  Let's do the whole village.  Holy ass.  You ever see a head come apart like that?  Yeah.  Let's do the whole village. 
[01:00:30]  30 years late.  I'm in combat.  This is great.  Why'd I miss this?  It's so easy.  I don't know what I was so scared of when they told me to report.  And I ran off to England because this is just a piece of cake.  You take your big jet plane, you fly low.  There's another five.  I just wanted to tell you.  Groovy.  Why would he pick Vietnam? 
[01:01:00]  He's got two months to waste.  And he goes over there.  I'm going to call in an airstrike.  Come on, love.  Come on.  Oh, look at that.  It's a beautiful man.  It's a beautiful man.  Unbelievable.  Get the claymores.  Nothing's going on anymore, you idiot.  God damn surrounded by goo, gongs and legs.  Fly over to Hanoi Hilton. 
[01:01:30]  Come on.  Here we go.  Everyone goes home.  Everyone goes home.  Oh, boy.  Come on.  We've got to take a break.  Jesus, man.  Kitten in Vietnam.  Vietnam.  It is Opie and Anthony. 
[01:02:00]  Hello.  How are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  ONA, yesterday, my sister was listening to Z100, and they were talking about putting  a Z-free money sticker on, on, on cars.  Z-free money sticker.  And, and then they're like, if you have a sticker that says WOW, take it off, because  it won't get you anything.  Oh, yeah.  A WOW, only food. 
[01:02:30]  A WOW sticker will get you a lot more than a Z-free sticker.  What losers?  A Z-free sticker.  A Z-free money sticker.  Do you think any, that is the stupidest thing.  Do you think anyone wins money on those stupid bumper stickers, radio station campaigns?  That's why we did WOW.  Yeah.  It's a no-brainer.  It's, people give you something, boob, just for putting a sticker on it.  It doesn't have to be someone from the station.  Let's drive it around.  Let me explain something about radio. 
[01:03:00]  Well, we'll take down the curtain again here, Anthony.  Yeah.  A station like Z-100, okay.  So they have these Z-free money stickers.  Z-free money sticker, everybody.  Get your sticker on.  We're going to be giving you cash.  So they're hoping to get maybe a couple thousand stickers out there.  Mm-hmm.  And they'll give prizes to maybe 10 to 20 people.  Yeah.  Tops.  Yeah.  I guarantee, as we sit here on this fine Whip-a-Mow Wednesday, that hundreds upon hundreds  of people are seeing stuff on the highway because of our WOW stickers. 
[01:03:30]  Won't get you nothing.  They are so jealous of our WOW sticker campaign.  Have you seen how many cars come in and out of this city?  Have you seen the traffic?  Do you know the numbers of cars that are driving on this road?  What are the odds that you're going to stick a great WOW sticker on your car and someone  from that station is going to see it and what, like pull you over and give you money?  Pull you over and give you Britney Spears tickets or something?  A better chance of getting pulled over with a gun to your head and someone taking a car 
[01:04:00]  in this city than there is of you getting money.  See, the WOW sticker's cool because the potential of every girl with boobs is the one that's giving  you the prize.  Right.  It doesn't have to be someone that works here.  Instead of one prize there and giving out money, we have thousands and thousands of women  that are willing to flash guys that have WOW in their car.  That's the beauty of it.  And the only reason I'm bringing it up on that stupid station is because they are very, 
[01:04:30]  very jealous of our bumper sticker campaign this fine season.  Because let's face it, wherever you go, you're seeing WOW.  You're seeing WOW.  Yeah.  That's it.  It doesn't have to, you don't have to bump into anybody except a woman with boobs.  They're giving away the prize.  And just to put it in perspective, do you guys realize we ordered 150,000 brand new WOW stickers?  Yeah.  Guess how many we have left? 
[01:05:00]  How many?  Practically none.  Really?  We're going to have to reorder?  Practically none.  Well, I'm seeing them all over the place.  We're putting another rush order in to get more stickers because this is how hot this damn WOW thing is.  And I've seen a bunch of people with the homemade versions.  We love the homemade versions.  Yeah.  Still.  Still.  I'm very flattered when I see the homemade WOWs on the car.  Swift Mountain, say, beautiful day.  Get the WOW on your car.  So they can say whatever they want, but they're goddamn jealous of this radio station, our show,  and our listeners that are just going nuts over this WOW thing. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Get that WOW off your car.  Get the Z100 sticker on there.  That'll get you something.  We're paying you to listen to us.  3-100.  Speaking of ridiculous other radio station stuff,  do you see the new commercial with that small bone chick and Terry Garr?  Yeah.  The light FM, I guess it is.  I joke with Sandy about it all the time.  It is the layman.  If you're a radio guy, that is the biggest embarrassment in the world. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  See, Terry Garr is sitting there with that small bone, I guess her name is,  and she says, here's how easy it is to play the music and not talk some kind of happy horse crap like that.  And small bone reaches over and pushes a button, doesn't say a word, and folds her arms.  That's her monkey ass job.  And shrugs.  And shrugs like, that's all I do.  That's all I do.  That's it.  So I guess she was getting pissed, but now there's an ad where she actually talks. 
[01:06:30]  Uh-huh.  But she's like, and that was some, you know, crap band, insert crap band here, on Light FM.  And Terry Garr and her stuff.  So it just, I swear to God, when you see her and Terry Garr sitting in those seats,  all you want to do is bust in the studio and spray them with banana juice.  I swear to God, I want to step on the console like a monkey in a cage and just spray them with banana juice.  I'm over here now.  I know, guys.  That's your line.  We know.  We know.  I could do the entire job with a dildo in my mouth. 
[01:07:00]  Can I say that?  I'm over here now.  I know, guys.  What's her name?  I'm Valerie Smalldon.  I can do this entire job with a dildo in my mouth.  Because I don't have to talk.  I just have to press buttons.  Where's Terry Garr?  Terry Garr.  She was hot for ten minutes.  Yeah.  What happened?  She's old now, eh?  She's been around forever.  She only needs one hand.  I could diddle myself and seg song with a dildo in my mouth. 
[01:07:30]  All I need is one arm.  Our guest DJ today, Christopher Reed.  And we don't even have to do anything different to the studio.  He's just got to roll up to the console.  All right.  I'll do another visual impression.  I love your visuals.  Okay.  So do the people.  I'm good at the audio impressions, which is very important if you're doing a radio show.  I'm good at visuals, though.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:08:00]  Here's my impression of Christopher Reed, DJ in the show.  Okay.  And he has to hit commercial.  Right.  Okay.  And I need my seat lowers.  It's a visual bed, of course.  Yeah.  By the way, as we get ready for the visual impression, that's as low as it goes.  I need a...  Is there another seat?  Give me a stinky seat.  That's a short chair.  If you want to get one of these WOW stickers, self-addressed stamped envelope, WNW, 10th Floor, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106, attention WOW sticker. 
[01:08:30]  I think that address is on the WNW website.  All right.  My visual impression of Christopher Reed, DJ, and let's say it's Light FM.  Okay.  All right.  Here he is.  Ready to go into a Celine song from Fox.  Okay.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  We need the Celine song.  Okay.  Where's the Celine song?  It's like, you know, because like when the music ends, you know, the jock has to do the clever seg that you don't even notice at home. 
[01:09:00]  They're pushing the button in between songs, and it's so smooth, so seamless, you don't even notice.  That's how you're supposed to do it.  So, Opie will do Christopher Reeve as the stand-in DJ for Valerie Smuldone.  Okay.  Here's Celine Dion ending and Christopher Reeve.  Ending.  Christopher Reeve.  I light FM.  I hope he's wheeled up to the board, about chest high.  All right.  There's the song ending.  And eyes moving back and forth, looking troubled. 
[01:09:30]  And dead air.  He's just sitting there, not moving.  That is just horrible, man.  So, I guess Christopher Reeve couldn't officially DJ later.  Valerie Smuldone is better than Christopher Reeve.  That is what we're learning here, because if the song ended, he still wouldn't be able to do anything.  So, you can push the button.  All right.  Here it is. 
[01:10:00]  Now, look.  His eyes are looking very distressed, very troubled that he can't hit the button.  They're horrible, man.  Thank you.  Valerie Smuldone.  Thank you.  I could diddle myself, have my hand on a big, giant piece of man meat, have a dildo firmly  in place in my mouth, and still play the songs and get approval from Terry Garr.  Well, Ed, this is a first making fun of my crotch. 
[01:10:30]  This is a first making fun of other radio shows and other radio jocks, and they don't  belong to our company.  This is good.  God damn it, I'm going to burn them.  And before we end this break, if you ever see Anthony and I in dresses, advertising  for our show on TV, please drive up to the station and shoot us in the back of the head.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  What is that?  Scott and Todd. 
[01:11:00]  That is embarrassing.  In dresses.  How pathetic do you have to be that you're going to be dressed in drag on TV to promote  your stupid radio show?  It's not worth it.  It's not worth it.  Just strap on the friggin' appliances and go at each other's butts.  Oh.  With the dress, and then the big punchline is that they were just, what, dreaming or something?  Whatever.  What was that?  I don't even know how it goes.  And then one of them, Todd, is still wearing a dress.  You can pretend you're dreaming, but you're on TV wearing dresses. 
[01:11:30]  Wearing dresses.  And I hear that's like a big commercial all over the United States in different markets.  Yeah.  Like the Flappy and Wappy show in Phoenix does the same commercial.  Yeah.  For all you PLJ fans out there, you know, if you are fans of their show, you're like, oh,  wow.  Man, they're so creative.  Look at their little, you know, TV commercial promoting their morning show.  Yeah.  No, see, that commercial's done all over the country.  It's just different jocks and different, uh...  It's a formula commercial.  Different dresses.  It tested very well in our research, so we have it in all different markets. 
[01:12:00]  We just can't do the same spot in overlapping markets.  Got it.  And if Scott Jackson gets another facelift, you can have a, you know what, hanging from  his chin.  A schlong.  I got a schlong hanging from my chin.  There's a schlong.  Look at this.  I'm squeezing my sack on my neck.  I'm like a big booster.  Why do you need so many facelifts if you're on radio?  I look like Foghorn Leghorn with a scrotum on my chin.  Oh, brother. 
[01:12:30]  All right, Dan, we have to take a break.  Yeah.  We have a nice surprise for everyone right now, as Whippin' My Wednesday continues.  We got some clips from our road show from last Thursday, Anthony.  Yeah.  Some of the highlights were some of the guys performing their most offensive songs there.  Yes.  A lot of video clips, a lot of brand new video clips up on foundrymusic.com today.  Steve got the clip of Stephen Lynch doing FBA up there.  It's hilarious.  With the additional verses.  Amazing.  Absolutely hilarious.  It's www.foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com. 
[01:13:00]  Okay?  Right.  But right now, here's our buddy, our pal.  He's a rock star.  Fuel, live from our road show in front of about 2,000 people singing a song you all know  and love.  Mm-hmm.  Baby Raper.  The other inmate think I'm kind of sick  Because of where I like to get my sick 
[01:13:30]  And how I always talk about the day  I met that little hottie, John Benet  Whose parents keep killer, by the way  I wish that they could somehow understand  This is hard  I'm just an average, ordinary man  But somehow they just can't seem to dance 
[01:14:00]  While Maggie Simpson always makes me worse  Here it comes  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper  The food that is round  That's good enough to eat  I'm a baby raper 
[01:14:30]  I'm a baby raper  The young is scary  I always take the hurt to it  And I don't know  You can't take the hurt to it  I'm a baby raper  When mommy turns away  I go for more  Sing them songs 
[01:15:00]  Tell them that they're sweet  I'm a baby raper  As I whip the little booze off their feet  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper  So sweet and young  They're good enough to eat  Baby raper 
[01:15:30]  I'm a baby raper  The young is scary  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper  The young is scary  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper 
[01:16:00]  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper  The young is scary  I always take the hurt to sleep  Let's hear it for fuel!  You got fuel?  You're a sick out fuel  We don't play a few words  But we sure like to take our legs back like a Tyson chicken

[01:22:00]  Finally  He dropped his hand lower  And I went  I turned right around to him  And I said  I love you  Hello  Hello  Hello  Hello  Hello  Wait, wait  Bob  I can't get past  The fact that  You're not the guy  Yes, I am  You were just a guy  In the suit  Don't start with me  Were you actually  In the suit?  No  Now, are you  A man of shorts  Thatcher?  Yes, I am  And how tall  Would you be?  I am 5'6  Okay 
[01:22:30]  And did you  Move it around  In there?  Yeah  I did everything  With it  In fact, Erwin Allen  Allowed Jonathan Harris  And myself  To create our own  Characterization  Yes  What's your claim to fame?  I mean, you didn't even walk  Oh, yes, I did  Was it on a wheel thing?  No  When it was in the full outfit  They pulled it with cables  Because the thing weighed  350 pounds  They pulled it with cables  And then sometimes  I would carry the top section  Which weighed 250 pounds  I would carry that  On a parachute type harness  And just when we thought 
[01:23:00]  We were a big deal  We were at the gun  In front of 11,000 people  Yeah  This shows how pathetic  We still are  We can't even get the guy  That does the robot  Away from Lost in Space  Who's his agent?  Forrest Lawn?  How old is he?  Who is the agent?  William Morris  That's Forrest Lawn  That's for damn sure  The actual William Morris  That's the guy  He died  So, hey  What have you done lately?  What have I done lately?  Well, since Lost in Space  I did several Jerry Lewis films  Of course  Wow  That'll get you a few laughs 
[01:23:30]  They're definitely Lost in Space  Oh, I'm lost  And you believe it  What do you ask the guy  That was just in a suit  And didn't do the voice?  You ever fart in the costume?  No, but I'll tell you this  Mark Guttered  And Bill Moomey  Locked me in there for lunch  Two things happened  Well, yeah  Number one  My wife knew where I was  Every moment  And second of all  I had nothing else to do  So I lit up a cigarette  And I was smoking  And Irwin Allen came on the set  The smoke coming out of it  Went for the fire extinguisher 
[01:24:00]  And  And  And  And hair coming out of course  But from then on  Anytime smoke had to come out  Of the robot  They hand him to the guard  You want a really uncomfortable radio?  Yeah  Let's just not say anything anymore  Until he hangs up  Check it out when Mark got it  All right  That's  Wow  What else can you tell us?  What else can I tell you?  Yeah, hey  As a robot, you know  I have a great memory  Because my computer  Let him go  Let him go until he gets there  Focus on all different things  So now  I have a memory of you guys  And I expect to see your asses 
[01:24:30]  Out here at the convention  If you're not out here  I'll send Dr. Smith  To do what he's done  To many of us  Now  Since you have  Such a busy schedule  And dialogue is at a rarity  I must go  Because I've got to get down  To the fans  But I really appreciate  Being on your show 
[01:25:00]  And I look forward to you  Coming out  And being online  All right guys  And remember  If you want a star  Get a hold of Big Ten  Kev  Kev does it all  All right  Hey guys  It's Big Kev  I have never felt more  Like a Met  My entire life  My God  I'd say something  Ping pong balls  Anything  Whatever Ben 
[01:25:30]  Hello  Hello  Hello  It's so uncomfortable  Oh I am friggin sweating 
[01:26:00]  I'm cringing  That is awful  It's so uncomfortable  I think Kev's got to be like  Oh this show  You know  Sometimes the jib will get stuck  Other times  One time I put the right leg  On backwards  And I had to start over  Again  And put the left leg on  One time I was lost  In Cleveland  One time I was lost 
[01:26:30]  In New Jersey  I've never been lost  In Spain  Not really  However  All right  Oh actually two costumes  Fascinating  One I would make  For public appearances  We had to do that same interview  With the guys  That were in the Star Wars suit  I was like  What are you doing here  When the movie came out  It was the last movie  That came out  Star Wars 1  All the guys 
[01:27:00]  Who are not in  The most recent  Star Wars movie  Were here  Like Boba Fett  The guy that was in  R2-D2  The guy that played  Darth Vader  The Wookiee  And the Darth Vader guy  Right  And we didn't know  What to ask him  Because all they were  Were the guys in the suit  And it turned out  He was only the Darth Vader one  And the third one  Like it wasn't even  The first Darth Vader guy  It was like the third one  Interesting enough  Interesting enough 
[01:27:30]  The suits today  Are flame retarded  One time  I was smoking a cigar  In between takes  In between takes  It was episode number 72  Where we get lost in space  And an air smell on my legs  Now these suits today  They're flame retarded  But I lost a pill 
[01:28:00]  That day  Erwin Allen  Came over to me  And said  Where's your soul  The great Erwin Allen  The great Erwin Allen  I don't have to be confused  With Marty Allen  Steve Allen  Herb Allen  Paul Allen  Burns and Allen  Burns Allen  Allen  Paul Allen  He has to go  Well  I gotta go  I gotta go  Wait

[01:30:00]  And how many pieces  It was in  When I see these actors  Like Jim Carrey  In his cringe costume  It's reminding me  Of the day that  Erwin Allen and I  Were lost  In  On the Jersey term  By going to  The Spokka convention  I go  And one more guy  Called me  Mr. Fox  And I go  I go  But you don't  You didn't even  Walk in the costume  Well we had  Holy shit

[01:31:30]  But the costume  Weighs 500 pounds  And it was pulled  By a cable system  One time I was smoking  They didn't  They didn't even  Trust me to walk  They had to pull me  With a  They pulled me  With police  Today  Alf and Chewbacca  They don't know  What it was like  Actors strike my ass  Byron Allen  Debbie Allen  Allen from Scooby Doo  Wow

Oh, do I need a drink?  Yeah, let's take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  We have no clue what we're doing next, but if you want to stick around, by all means do so, okay?  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:41:30]  One of these things.  WNEW.  In theaters now, the Brady Bunch movie.  That's right.  It's those lovable six crazy Brady's.  Mom, Mom.  I'm kind of uncuncated.  I'm kind of uncuncated.  Oh, no.  You're not a band.  Then you die again.  I'm kind of uncuncated.  Oh, congratulations, honey.  Why don't you tell Alex to me?  He's in a room.  Oh.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to, you know, turn a cent to see what the hell these idiots are doing next. 
[01:42:00]  Opie.  And then, Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  So go screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  One, two, three.  W.  M.  W.  M.  Opie.  Anthony.  This is a God-given talent to be this stupid and this funny and this filthy.  One, two, three.  One, two, three.  One, two, three.  One, two, three. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, Tom Brokaw.  Sorry.  This guy, I believe, is thicker than Norton.  Tom Brokaw?  I think he is.  Secretly, do you think he's thicker than Norton?  A lot of people think Tom Brokaw is just this very respectable news guy.  Which I guess he is.  You know, he gets on there.  He puts on the face.  He can read the cue cards.  Tell him from.  And, uh...  Never mind.  Uh, and, uh, he knows how to do the news. 
[01:43:00]  But, um, I think secretly, he's a pervert.  And I think this story kind of scratches the surface of what he's all about.  It's, uh, the headline reads, Tom Brokaw's sex advice.  Yeah.  Conservative anchorman Tom Brokaw came on like any other horny sex in the city fan when he  stops star Kristen Davis.  Kristen Davis.  Who plays Charlotte on a New York street and, uh, gushed about how hot she is on the show. 
[01:43:30]  He's telling girls that they're hot?  That's Tom Brokaw.  Tom even discussed storylines.  Storylines.  And told her she should have stayed with that gardener she seduced.  Yeah.  Kristen admits she was surprised because she thought, like millions of us, that Tom is just  a stuffy old square.  A stuffy old square.  But, uh, she did just scratch the surface.  I think much like, uh, he's a lot like, uh, Dan Norton.  Yeah.  He's, uh, he's, uh, he's a sex in the city fan.  And, uh, she, of course, plays Charlotte on the show. 
[01:44:00]  Uh, Charlotte.  Charlotte.  Right.  Charlotte.  Yeah.  She, she, she's more of a pooty one.  I, I personally like Samantha.  I told her that she's a real whore bag.  And I still like her whore bag.  And, of course, Carrie, who's her life, Sarah Jessica Parker, is a lovely storyline. 
[01:44:30]  I always wanted to see what it was like for Ruth Bledgy to have sex.  Hey, it's okay.  Tom broke up with that.  Oh, you know, nothing.  Well, that's what's great.  I think it needs a little more anal.  And I told her that.  He goes, Tom broke up.  You might not, you know, think of me as a, you might think of me as a prude and an old stuffy.  But I like some backdoor action.  Tom broke up, NBC, Night One News. 
[01:45:00]  It's really great.  I like episodes where they talk about music.  You know, once, me and Katie Couric, do you remember New Year's Eve and Times Square with me and Katie Couric?  You know, when that ball went down, so did Katie.  It was quite a night for me, Tom broke up.  She likes that funky-tasting sponge.  I got to be honest with you.  One time, me and Katie were driving back from a local location, and she had her head under the steering wheel and couldn't get it up, 
[01:45:30]  and I was sipping urine from champagne glass.  And it was that kind of guy.  But then I was pumping her butt, and it pulled up something, and it turned into a water shot pudding.  And the whole rest of the drive home was sent with me with my hand out the window.  I was thinking of it, making me a little lose.  I missed a broken jaw?  Yes.  You sound really out of it today. 
[01:46:00]  I'm tired.  It was a night of animal nitrate ecstasy and butt sex at the rave party I went to.  People think I'm square, but I rave with the goth all night.  I love those goth kicks.  They could chew up a crotch rocket like no other.  Oof.  My crotch smells like an alley.  Okay, okay.  I like being urine in the mouth.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:46:30]  I let all the girls from Sex on the City know I have to be a character.  They all have a square newsman character where they all separately have sex with him.  Not on a show.  I'm talking real life.  Come on over.  I can be Mr. Big.  You know Mr. Big?  Hey, Tom Brokaw is packing some meat in his pants.  I've got to be honest with you.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I was busted on the teen voyeur bus. 
[01:47:00]  I got away with some of my connections.  I was having anal with one of the voyeur bus girls in the shower when the police came.  Smoking some AK-47.  I love that stuff.  I got, got, got.  Tom, we're very surprised that you didn't cover the teen voyeur bus.  I covered it.  I was escaping with my career.  Yeah.  All I could do was reach under the couch and take Mark's stash of AK-47.  Later, I smoked a big fatty with Tristan Davis. 
[01:47:30]  Saw it with Sex on the City.  Yeah, you're a big fan of Sex on the City.  I'm a big fan of Sex anywhere.  I swear to God, I was watching that show on HBO the other night.  Yeah.  What was it called?  Queer as Folk.  Yeah.  I didn't even care they were men.  As long as it was death.  I was spanking out a few bastards.  Fabulous.  I even don't like cosmopolitan.  Even this song is getting me all hointy.  I just believe it.  I think it's sad to get drunk. 
[01:48:00]  Naked.  Look, wait a minute.  I think I'm stretching.  Oh, my God.  Tom Brokaw spanking out a bag.  What's wrong?  Everyone thinks I'm just disgusting.  Why can't a guy like Tom Brokaw say things like,  Suck it, bitch.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  The Western Revolt, who cares?  Give me some bitch to suck it. 
[01:48:30]  I've been up all night.  Miranda's hot, and she put two fingers in my naughty spot.  There's nothing wrong with that.  It's not being gay or anything.  You've got some funky senses.  Yes, yes, I do.  You're just a hot bitch.  You're a hot, horny bitch.  I'm both a NBC Nightly News.  Samantha, suck it.  Fuck it.  He's got a regular Montana contract in her drone. 
[01:49:00]  I love the show.  I was talking storylines and perspective storylines to the girl.  I'd like to see some, I don't know, some good old-fashioned BJs.  Why can't they show it on the show?  It's HBO.  Just show it.  I love Big Pussy.  Too bad he's dead.  That's another great show.  No, that's the problem.  I heard Big Pussy.  I just thought it was from Sex and the City, one of my favorites. 
[01:49:30]  No, that's the problem.  I love this show.  Tom, you all right?  I stayed up last night watching a three episode of Sex and the City.  I knew I had to get up, and my AK-47 put me on my ass.  I want to thank Michael Mark.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, thank you.  You're a filthy whore.  No, no.  You are a kid-toucher.  Go talk.  Cancel all newscast. 
[01:50:00]  I love Queer as Folk.  Thank you, Mr. Broken Job.  Did everybody mention Queer as Folk?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Mr. Broken Job was talking about Queer as Folk.  I love Queer as Folk.  You do, Mr. Riley?  One of my favorites, oh, oh.  I'm Queer as Folk.  I love it.  Any show with gay young men having sex, oh, oh.  Hey, hey, oh, oh.  Hey.  I love it.  Hey.  I got some buggy-tasting trunks. 
[01:50:30]  Oh.  Hey.  That's nothing, Riley.  Hey.  I always talk like I have a mouthful of something.  Oh.  Hey.  I'm playing out of my mouth.  Clear as Folk, Watson.  Oh.  Oh.  That's nothing, Riley.  Even as a kid watching The Ghost and Mrs. Mewa, you knew that guy was the faggiest.  The faggiest.  You never even saw him on that.  It was like, The Ghost and Mrs. Mewa.  No.  Oh.  What was the game show he was always on?  Tattletail?  He was on that game, too.  And that game.  Bow.  Bow.  Bow.  Bow.  Bow.  Bow.  Oh.  The answer is penis. 
[01:51:00]  I don't care.  Fill in the blank.  Penis.  Fill in my blank.  Bow.  Bow.  The Ghost and Mrs. Mewa.  He was like, Mrs. Mewa was some nice, you know, looking woman.  Yeah.  And she was in love with this ghost.  And Charles Nelson Riley was just a personal friend of hers.  Never tried to hit on her or anything.  He was even a fag on the shelf.  Bow.  A ghost.  Oh.  Is he hot?  Bow.  I've never had ghost penis.  Bow.  Charles Nelson Riley.  Bow.  Gay Marco. 
[01:51:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Do you like Charles Nelson Riley, Gay Marco?  Bow.  Oh, he's such a, he's so gay.  Marco's calling me gay.  I'm terminal fag.  You cannot get any more fag.  If you ask somebody how much more fag that you get, the answer would be none.  None more fag.  Bow.  I love final fag.  Bow.  What's up, Marco?  Well, I'm calling to see if you watch Queer as Folk.  Queer as Folk.  We missed that one.  We were at the next stage. 
[01:52:00]  It was fabulous.  It was so fabulous.  Did you like it?  The sex scenes were so graphic.  Oh, my God.  Son of a, Marco.  Please, Marco.  At 15 minutes into it, they actually had a lesbian scene.  Oh, that's disgusting.  I hate women.  No.  If any straight man was watching this, he would not make it to that point because there was  so much gay sex going on.  I mean, they were doing it in bathrooms.  They were doing it in bars.  They were doing it in bars.  They were doing it everywhere.  Oh, I love it.  Was this your life story, Marco?  I could really relate to it. 
[01:52:30]  I mean, every character, it's about five guys living in Pittsburgh.  I mean, it's so unbelievable because they're all gorgeous.  Marco, is it true that when gay men watch that, they've got to put windshield wipers on  their television?  Oh.  Please.  Oh.  Did your TV look like you threw glazed donuts at it?  Oh.  I was at the spasms party in Chelsea.  I was at the spasms party in Chelsea.  Ten minutes before the show, I'm walking down 7th Avenue.  There's not a fool on the street.  Everybody's like home watching queer folk.  Everyone's having anal.  Oh.  I actually got my boyfriend on all fours, put the TV on his back and just watched it that 
[01:53:00]  way.  Oh.  That's the best thing.  That's the best thing.  You must live in Chelsea, Marco, huh?  No, I live in the island.  But my new boyfriend, Glenn, who's such a hottie, Heidi Whitey, he had a little party.  Why do you have to talk about your new boyfriend?  He's so cute.  So anyway, you missed the lesbian scene.  Actually, why Heidi Whitey is because the skid marks are also white?  Oh, they don't know.  Oh, well, they've got stuff.  You have to get a copy just to do the lesbian scene. 
[01:53:30]  I was like screaming.  Oh, my God.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Even though I'm bisexual, it's nothing for me.  You have boys and men.  Oh, come back to that.  And you know that women, let me tell you, if all of a sudden you turn on your TV Sunday,  you have show time, all of a sudden, where did this come from?  Let me tell you something.  You have boys and a husband?  He's gay.  Oh.  Are you really telling everyone you're bisexual now just because you had a little peach?  Of course.  Bisexual, butt and mouth. 
[01:54:00]  Oh.  Oh.  That's like me.  Oh.  And then find that very, very attractive.  So what's up with this queer folk thing?  It was just, it was groundbreaking television.  I can't tell you.  Earthbreaking.  Oh.  That too, yes.  Tell us about the first sex scene, Jay Marco.  Lots of anal sex going on.  In a bar.  Oh, in a bar.  The first scene.  They're having sex in a bar.  I was like, oh, my God.  It was back.  I was always having flashbacks to 1981 in Geneseo. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, my God.  I'll never forget it.  I'll never forget it.  Easy.  Jay Marco, are you a Geneseo?  Easy, Mr. Obscure reference.  Actually, I was a Geneseo.  Easy.  That was a few years before me, thank God.  Clear as balls.  You bastard.  Is this going to be on every week?  What's the deal?  It's going to be on every week.  This Sunday, they had double episodes to kind of like draw you in because the first hour was kind of lame, but it kind of picked up towards the second half. 
[01:55:00]  And then it's going to be on every Sunday at 10 o'clock.  I'm so excited.  Did you get my postcard?  I sent you queer as folk postcards.  Oh, nice.  Hey, I can't wait.  No, we did not get those, Mark.  Oh, they were in your email.  They probably got deleted somehow, but...  Oh, all right.  Well...  It was to make sure to tune in towards queer as folk.  It was groundbreaking gay TV.  Oh, gay TV.  Oh, man.  Oh, the boy's hot. 
[01:55:30]  Did a bunch of you guys get together and, you know, kind of watch it together?  Yes.  We all got together.  We had Cosmopolitans.  Of course.  We sat around.  We had a little homo drink.  Cosmopolitans.  They'd all sit around because what we did, we got a circle jerk party.  And the last one to finish before we got to the show won.  Please!  Were you guys all wearing bathrobes and drinking little Cosmopolitans?  No, please.  I was wearing short shorts and a t-shirt.  I got confused with another bunch of guys. 
[01:56:00]  Sorry.  You're my clearest folk.  All right, Marco.  Back in the show.  Nice to meet you.  Did you pinch your helmet while I was watching this damn show?  Oh, my God.  I tell you, the sex scenes were so graphic.  And these guys who were supposed to be in the show are supposedly straight?  Yeah, right.  I mean, they were, like, really getting into it.  Wasn't Hal Sparks one of the actors or something?  Yes, and he played this gay guy who works at, like, K-Mart and everybody thinks he's straight. 
[01:56:30]  I could so relate to that character.  That's like me.  Who does that straight?  That's like people thinking I'm straight.  Everybody at work thinks I'm straight.  And I'm like, you know, I could so relate to this character.  It was heartbreaking.  I can relate, too.  People think I only have eight or six five times a day.  And it's actually ten.  So I'm kidding.  It's such a secret.  Oh.  And then there was a teen, a 17-year-old boy.  Oh, stop it.  He was so cute.  Oh.  You get me so hot, Marco.  I'm talking about being gay.  Oh. 
[01:57:00]  And he comes out and meets this guy.  And they have sex.  Oh, it was just sex, sex, sex, sex.  Oh, you're such a fag.  Oh.  If anybody comes into the show, they think that being gay is all about sex.  What is it?  What is it about?  You don't have a second.  I'm being gay.  Oh.  Oh, I guess you're right.  All right, Marco.  All right.  You want to plug anything?  Thank you, Marco.  Oh, I'm going to come.  All right.  Thank you, Marco.  Okay, bye.  Remember, you're bisexual now.  I'm bisexual.  Yeah, sure you are. 
[01:57:30]  People always say that.  Gay doesn't always have to be about sex.  I tried to cut my voice on that, but I have my mouth full.  Oh.  Oh.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  I had a call.  I'm sitting here listening.  Yeah.  This guy says everyone that he works with thinks he's straight.  Yeah.  What does he work?  At the Helen Keller Institute?  All the people who jump on them blind?  They didn't even get the vibe.  This guy is screaming, violate my hiney.  This guy has probably no electricity back there anymore. 
[01:58:00]  It just falls out.  All right.  I hear when he barks, it sounds like, ah.  Frank, phone call today.  Very good.  Thank you.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  More girls, more good.  Hookers for everyone.  Sure, come on in.  No longer will our pieces remain glassed and unused.  1027.  NW, NW.  NW. 
[01:58:30]  The Don and Mike Show.  The Don and Mike Show.  The new man of my town would always feel nice to me.  What would you like, Michael?  That one.  You know, there's always strawberry shortcake, and I never knew it.  I couldn't read it.  Oh, look.  Here comes that point with a potential shoot.  You said I want the strawberry shortcake.  You always say something like that.  Good luck with your junior year.  My good humor, man.  Three ice cream.  He gave me a chocolate eclair.  I mean, he gave me a chocolate eclair.  The Don and Mike Show.  Weeknight.  W NW. 
[01:59:00]  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027.  W NW.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  It's the O&H show.  A bunch of ladies on hold.  They want to play What's in My Dance, and they look like African princesses.  Yeah, it's good.  We've never done this before.  I want to hear what the different in the sound is. 
[01:59:30]  We'll talk to them in a second.  You got something?  Yeah.  You know that contest, I guess, M&M's is running?  If you open up M&M's and it's various colors in there that aren't the normal M&M colors,  you could win a million bucks.  It seems like an inmate at the Purgatory Correctional Facility in Utah.  So what do you want?  You got this bag of M&M's for helping out with the chore.  That prison must really suck.  There you go.  You're going to mop up inmate crap from the toilet.  And here's a bag of M&M's for you.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  You got the M&M's from the vending machine, Anthony, on the way back to a cell, I guess, huh?  No, they actually, one of the guards gave it to him for doing such a good job cleaning up.  They gave him a little bag of M&M's.  Cleaning up what?  Yeah, I know.  So he opens it up and he sees all kinds of different colors that he's not used to.  And the other inmates, see, I wouldn't have known better.  I'd have eaten them, right?  Yeah.  The other inmates are like, oh, I think you won a million bucks.  That's the contest.  Because he saw blue ones and the yellow ones are the colors that aren't part of the M&M's. 
[02:00:30]  And it's a fix-up-the-mix-up contest or something like that.  So it said he's a first prize winner.  And the prize, the big prize is a million dollars.  So there you go, first prize winner.  Right.  That means I won a million dollars.  So there's a little bit of an outrage that a guy in prison is winning the million dollar M&M prize.  But it turns out, Opie, that first prize is first prize.  He did not win the grand prize, which is a million dollars.  Wouldn't the grand prize be first prize? 
[02:01:00]  No, it must be like first runner-up.  Oh, okay.  You know?  First prize is not grand prize.  Grand prize, a million dollars.  Million dollars.  Now, you've got to think first prize is going to be pretty good, right?  Yeah.  It's a free 16-ounce bag to M&M.  Goddamn Cotman. 
[02:01:30]  That rock.  Yeah, so he didn't win.  He won a free bag of M&M.  Yes.  Thinking you've got a million bucks and you've got a bag of M&M.  That's too bad.  Mother Everest.  That's kind of like thinking you won a hundred grand, Anthony.  It turns out to be a candy bar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[02:02:00]  Hey!  I'm going to buy a truck.  I've got a piece of crap for a truck.  I'm going to get a new one.  I'm going to get a new truck.  A new truck.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  Whoa!  What?  What?  What a tool.  You know, we've got to play the damn thing.  Yeah, it's quick.  I love it.  Rick, get that real fast.  It's along the same lines.  This guy must have been like, damn!  The guy, by the way, is only serving, though, one year for attempted possession of methamphetamine.  What is that? 
[02:02:30]  You have attempted possession.  I grabbed for it.  Attempted possession.  I didn't reach it, and they arrested me.  Yeah, what's that?  Attempted possession.  I guess he was trying to buy it, but attempted possession.  You attempted to possess.  Don't you have to have the drugs on you, though?  I guess not, and you can get arrested for conspiracy to deal.  Like, say you're in a bar, and somebody comes up to you and goes, hey, you know where I could get some blow?  And you go, um, I think that guy in the corner.  Ugh.  And they go, just off the hand, you just go, I think that guy in the corner got some, and he goes over and gets some blow off of that. 
[02:03:00]  You get arrested for conspiracy.  You're effed?  You're effed.  Ugh.  I know someone that happened to.  It's just that he pointed to somebody in the bar.  I think we've all been asked, too.  Where can I get some blow off?  You just shut your mouth, man.  I don't know.  Ugh.  Arrested for conspiracy.  All right, Anthony, here's our 100 grand prank call, okay?  Right.  Hi.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Warfare.  Hey, Craig, guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 100 cent of calls. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, no way.  Yes, I won.  I won.  I don't know what you did, right?  107.  Oh, wow.  107th caller, congratulations.  100 grand.  Oh, my God.  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man, the first thing, I have this old, oh, I cannot.  Jeez, I've got to come.  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner.  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this, oh, man, I got this for a truck. 
[02:04:00]  I've got to get a new one.  Wait, dude, how are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you been saying?  I've been listening to the f***ing radio for, like, three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  It's a candy bar. 
[02:04:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, yeah, we pulled out a little crank on somebody.  Yeah.  Let's go to Amanda.  Amanda?  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, and I'm like...  Oh, yeah, you're a sister.  Fine.  What can you tell?  We can tell by the voice.  We've played this game many times in the past. 
[02:05:00]  We don't feel like playing today, so don't challenge us.  But we can just tell from the voice.  Okay.  There's a certain dialect that people of African descent have.  It's just like anything else.  If you see, like a lot of people in the Jewish community,  you can tell by the way they talk that they're Jewish.  It's just the way Italians.  You go to Brooklyn and you start talking to an Italian,  you're not going to know he's Italian by the way he's talking?  Hey, come on, huh?  What are you talking about?  Hey, where's my eye rock?  How you doing? 
[02:05:30]  How you doing?  Hey, come on, Luke.  You know?  It's nothing bad.  Some people would have you believe that that's bad to even say it.  It's just the way it is.  We've played this game in the past.  We're like 90% correct.  Okay.  I'm guessing nationalities by just the voice.  So what kind of sister are you, Amanda?  I am a mutt who's in college.  You're a mutt.  I'm a mutt.  That's the best way to put it.  What's your background? 
[02:06:00]  My mom's side comes from Europe for the most part.  There's a lot of French, but my dad's side is mostly Haitian.  Haitian.  So you are a mulatto?  Yeah.  See, we want dark.  Yeah, we need...  We want...  Like...  We want, like...  Like...  I want right off...  Right from Nigeria.  Yeah, we want...  You know?  We want...  If we're going to play What's in My Past with a sister, we want dark.  Yeah.  How light are...  How dark are you?  Cafe latte?  Yeah.  We're looking for, like, black coffee. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  I ain't no black coffee here.  I want a girl that, like, you see on the Discovery channel.  That type of African woman.  We're looking right off the boat.  We're looking for great soda.  I'm talking real...  Yeah.  You're lost.  I think we're going to let you go.  You're not dark enough.  Okay.  But thank you for, you know, pulling up the show today.  You know the shows that you watch on Discovery with the guys that wear the big cones on their...  The big carrot sticks on their schweens? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  And they hunt...  They hunt monkeys.  Yeah.  Six thousand three feet.  Yeah.  And the women are walking around and they're, like, making the soup out of grubs.  Yeah.  And they're, like, nursing a kid and, you know, the weaving things.  There's flies all over.  You ever see that on Discovery Channel?  Sure have.  That's what we want.  That's it.  If you have...  If you have Gavin, nothing.  If you have ancestors that still, you know, use to communicate. 
[02:07:30]  That's what we're looking for today to play.  Guess what's in my pants.  Right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Let's see if Elizabeth qualifies.  Nice.  Elizabeth.  Unfortunately, I don't.  Oh, really?  Why?  How dark are you?  I'm like a car now.  Oh, we're looking for Florida Evans.  No, I'm a Jamaican girl.  That's the role.  I'm Jamaican Carmel.  Wow, that's hot, though, Ann. 
[02:08:00]  Are we going hot or dark?  Well, dark is hot, too, though.  We've got to go the whole room.  I'm picky.  You started out, you are black.  Now you aren't off the boat.  What are you doing?  All right, hold on.  Now, let's see if anyone's darker than you on the line, okay?  I want Amistad.  I'm talking dark.  We're talking Manute Bull.  Mickey Rivers.  Mickey Rivers.  That type of dark.  Let's see how dark Tracy is, though.  I'm like that.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, Tracy, what's up?  What's up, O&A?  How are you?  I'm killing. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, you sound dark.  Yes, I am dark, baby.  You sound dark.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm the black horse you've been looking for.  Oh, man.  Ah, yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Tell us a little bit about yourself.  Well, I'm 34, 24, 36.  You got that, eh?  Yes, I do.  Baby got back.  Yes, he does.  And how dark are you?  You're talking as dark as black coffee?  I'm not so dark.  I'm dark complexion, yeah, but I'm not going to go talk to that model or whatever. 
[02:09:00]  She's black.  Now, what about the hair on your head?  Oh, I have straight hair.  Straight hair?  My shoulders.  Is it natural or is it processed?  It's processed, baby, you know.  What happens when you don't do any processed?  Well, I get my hair done, like, once every week.  You look like fizzy?  No.  Ah, no.  That's funny.  It don't get, like, nappy, but it gets, like, curly.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So you sound dark.  I'll put some coffee in your cream. 
[02:09:30]  Ah.  Yeah, now I got it.  There you go.  All right, hold on, Jason.  Okay.  Let me just try Laundra.  There's some possibilities here.  Laundra.  Laundra.  Hey.  What's up, Laundra?  How you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  How the hell are you going to name Laundra?  Oh, ask my parents.  I don't know.  Ask her parents.  Ask her parents.  I got to do the Laundra today.  You guys got some fun names.  Yeah, I think I'm what you're looking for. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, how dark are you?  Almost like a licorice stick.  Whoa, that's all right.  Yeah.  All right, so we got black licorice, Anthony.  Yeah, that's good.  That's what we were looking for.  Give us a visual.  What do you look like?  I'm about 125, 5'6", and long black hair.  What do you got, the weave in?  Yeah, you could say it's glued on, baby.  Glued on.  What does your natural hair look like? 
[02:10:30]  My natural hair?  I don't want to know.  Like Oscar Gamble.  Why aren't you proud of your natural hair?  Shut it up, okay?  You live in America.  Oh, wow.  Be proud of your nappy hair, my sister.  Rise up, my sister, and be proud.  I am proud.  Yeah, but you cover up your hair with that weave.  Because I look better that way.  You know you were just trying to look better for the white devil. 
[02:11:00]  I've been watching the cable access, the Brooklyn thing.  Oh, yeah.  Those guys are on there all the time.  I was a star in it.  Do you see me?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, Anthony, do you want a laundry and play with you, my parents?  Absolutely.  All right, Londra, are you ready to play What's in My Pants?  Yes, I am.  All right.  You're going to pull down your pants and do what we say, right?  Yeah, they're kind of laughing at me.  That's all right.  Hold on.  We've got to get the theme song on the radio.  Okay.  Okay.  Go on, Mel.  The African version of Guess What's In My Pants, with the lovely laundry. 
[02:11:30]  Opie, we are going to have to change some of the selections.  What are the regular selections for What's In My Pants? 
[02:12:00]  Okay, we have the triangle.  Mm-hmm.  We have the mohawk.  Mm-hmm.  We have the Hitler mustache.  Yes.  And we have the wood floor.  Wood floor, sure.  So now we're going to change these.  The triangle is now going to be the Don King.  The Don King?  Yes.  The big Don King.  Okay.  I was thinking more like Oscar Gamble.  Oh, yeah?  You know when Oscar Gamble would put his Yankee hat on and the hair would fly off the 
[02:12:30]  side?  Okay, this is open for discussion.  We could have the Oscar Gamble.  I think we all had that baseball card when we were young, the Oscar Gamble.  He would try to get that Yankee hat on.  The Afro would be flying up the sides of the helmet.  I'm thinking if a girl's really, you know, hairy, that could be flying up the sides of her,  you know.  Okay.  So let's go with the Oscar Gamble.  Oscar Gamble.  I hate to, you know, it's for the triangle.  Okay.  All right.  Don King is out.  All right.  Now we need for the Mohawk. 
[02:13:00]  The Mohawk.  Now, Mr. T could be the Mohawk.  Yeah, I think that's close enough.  Mr. T is the Mohawk.  All right.  I've got one for the wood flooring.  Okay.  Do you have a suggestion?  Well, there are a few.  There's the Michael Jordan.  Okay.  Or the shaft.  All right.  I'm just thinking to stay on the same line as like the wood floor.  So I'm thinking like a blacktop.  Blacktop.  Very good.  Blacktop.  Blacktop.  Blacktop very smooth. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Now we just need something for Hitler mustache.  We could do Billy Dee Williams mustache.  Ah, the pencil.  Got that little pencil thing going.  That's good.  Quite a Hitler mustache, but that could work.  Someone's suggesting the Clyde Frazier, Anthony.  The Clyde Frazier?  That's pretty good.  He had some wacky styles going on in the 70s.  Okay.  No, whatever you want to do for the Hitler mustache. 
[02:14:00]  No one really has a good Hitler mustache.  The Montel Williams mustache?  Montel Williams.  Kind of like a little Hitler mustache.  Kind of that marine mustache thing you've got going.  You're just not hitting it, man.  No.  You've got it out there.  We can't play until we get the Hitler mustache equivalent.  Well, do we have the rest?  The basic triangle is now the Oscar gamble.  Talking very hairy.  The mohawk is the Mr. T.  Okay.  And for wood floor, it is Blacktop. 
[02:14:30]  But we cannot find the equivalent of the Hitler mustache.  Mm-hmm.  Or just that tiny little strip.  Yeah.  I hate when we're stumped.  That's a tough one because there's not really anybody that has that style.  Oh, the Little Richard.  Yeah, the Little Richard.  That's good.  All right.  We can play a little.  There's that.  Pete from Queens.  Thank you.  Pete from Queens.  We are taking the Little Richard.  Little Richard.  Hitler mustache. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, that's not bad at all.  All right.  London.  London.  Woo!  Yeah.  It is.  Lord, I can't believe it.  Woo!  There you go.  Another example of why this is the most interactive radio show in America.  Yeah, look at that.  Pete just helped us out from Queens.  Thank you.  The listeners always helping us out.  All right, Londra.  Yeah?  It is time finally to play What's in My Pad.  The Shirley Hemple.  I have a good one.  What? 
[02:15:30]  No, you don't tell her.  Don't tell us what you have.  I don't know what I have.  Okay.  Well, let's get the pants off or down.  Yeah, get that phone ready.  All right.  All right.  You're unzipping those pants?  Yeah.  Yeah, let us know what's going on because this is radio.  All right.  All right.  I'm opening a button and I'm zipping down my pants now.  What kind of panties you got on?  Bikini.  Bikini.  Woo!  A bikini.  Lovely.  Woo!  Yeah, a camera special.  A camera special. 
[02:16:00]  A blue light special?  Yeah, you could say.  Yeah.  All right.  Are you down to your panties?  Yeah.  I'm ready.  You guys ready?  You ready to play?  Yeah.  Where's the panties?  The Aunt Bunny must have.  What?  You want me to rub it on my panties?  Aunt Bunny, she's Aunt Bunny.  Goonie, goonie.  No, we're just making sure the panties are off.  They're down.  Oh, they're all right.  They're down.  All right.  Yeah, you're ready.  All right.  Why don't you talk us through this now? 
[02:16:30]  All right, Alondra, the way we play, you will rub the phone on your most intimate of areas  as per our instructions.  Then we will guess what you have in your pants, the Oscar Gamble, the Mr. T, the Little Richard,  or the Blacktop.  Okay.  And once all of us have decided and we ask you, you will then reveal what you indeed  do have in your pants.  And the first ever African princess, guess what's in my pants?  Yes.  Okay, Alondra, if you would, please rub in an up and down motion on your most intimate. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  You guys got it?  All right.  Now, side to side.  Okay.  Well, I might need that again.  Yeah.  I need to side to side a couple more times.  All right.  One more time.  Interesting. 
[02:17:30]  Interesting.  Okay.  Now, Alondra, if you would, in a circular motion.  Very slow.  Okay.  What are you thinking, O?  What are you thinking?  That just tricked me.  Yeah.  Woo, this is tough.  That tricked me.  This is tough.  Okay.  All right.  Who wants to go first?  I'll go first.  Opie, we'll go first.  Remember, Alondra, don't reveal this until we are all done and we ask you.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  You heard the sounds, though.  Would you like anything repeated, maybe?  I'm...  Yeah.  I need to side to side again.  Okay, say the side to side.  Alondra, if you would please, the side to side.  Okay.  I know your remarks have gotten me all left off.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay, I got it.  All right.  Okay.  Anthony, I'm going to go with...  Don't say what it is, Alondra, until we're...  All right.  I'm going to go with the Oscar gamble.  He's going with the Oscar gamble. 
[02:18:30]  Okay.  All right.  Hey, Mom, I guess I'm up, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Side to side is very tricky.  I'm torn.  I'm very torn here.  But I am going to go with the Mr. T.  I'm going with the Mr. T.  Which would be the Mohawk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's get Rick in on the game.  I think I'm going to...  I think I'm going to go with the little Richard.  Wow. 
[02:19:00]  We have a split decision here.  Interesting.  No one thinking the black top, which it very well could be also,  because I was kind of thrifting that way a little bit.  But all right.  Opie is saying Oscar gamble.  I am saying the Mr. T.  And Rick is saying the little Richard.  Londra, if you would please tell us what is in your pants.  Okay.  Well, I would call it Velcro Pats.  Straight down the middle.  Straight down the middle?  Yeah.  Would that be the equivalent of a Mohawk or a Mr. T?  Mr. T. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Mr. T.  Oh, Mr. T.  I was...  Side to side, I was hearing some inconsistency.  The Velcro Pats.  That's the Velcro Pats.  Yeah, I was hearing, like, a little bit of a different sound  that it would skate over when it hit the Velcro Pats.  That's how they put it.  But she has a Mr. T.  Great.  That's wonderful.  And the first ever African princess.  Guess what's in my pants.  Londra, thank you so much. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  Love you, guys.  Oh, oh.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  And I got into the Velcro.  Oh, Lordy, no.  Yes, sir.  What do you say?  What do you say?  Yes.  Hoorah!  Hoorah!  Hey, Londra.  Yes?  We want to give you something for playing today, okay?  Okay, thanks.  I don't know what the white man has to offer you, 
[02:20:30]  but hold on the line, okay?  All right.  All right.  Londra, the lovely Londra,  the first African princess to help us out  with, I guess, what's in your pants game.  I was excited.  That was awesome.  I like it.  Someone is suggesting the next time we play,  we should name the Hitler mustache the Ethiopian.  That's bad.  I pity the poor fool.  Try to get in his vagina.  The Mr. T.  Congratulations, Hank.  Thanks. 
[02:21:00]  I was very torn.  I thought also it was going to be what you said.  Yeah.  The Oscar gamble.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  I would love to play the same game with a bunch of Asian ladies.  That's a neat plug.  The Moe, the Moe, the Moe Howard, the Moe Howard,  and the Pete Rose.  It's pretty fun.  We'll do the Asian version one of these days, okay?  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[02:21:30]  That feels so good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so bad.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so bad.  Oh, so bad.  Oh, my God.  Oh, play with my balls.  Play with my balls.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah, just roll them around, baby.  Just roll them around. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, my God.  What?  I love it.  Uh-oh.  What?  Oh, my God.  Don't move.  I'll go get to the power.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  The sickness for such people having six sex.  This is going to help us continue to be a number one, right?  Yeah.  That means you're in love.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  W.N.E.W. 
[02:22:30]  I feel stupid.  Oh, so stupid.  I feel stupid and dumb and dumb.  O.P. and Anthony.  We've got a smile on our face.  Got a head up on us.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  Yeah.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  I mean, just because a brother man smoked a little weed on the corner here and there, 
[02:23:00]  killing with his buddies, you're going to arrest him for that?  Good night.  Yes, yes.  Yes, yes.  I know you're going to do it.  Good night.  Well, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yes, the extravaganza that is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:23:30]  We don't even know where to begin today.  212-757-1027.  So, uh, looks who just, uh, humbled into this.  What's up, man?  What's up, Hammer?  What's up, Hammer?  Hammer, are we hanging or what?  Hey, take your shirt off.  Never mind you did it.  Get it?  Yeah, we're hanging.  Yes, we are.  435.  What have you been up to, Jim?  Since the last time we saw you.  Fat. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  Every day, I kind of like my local ice cream store.  Let me get a pint of the mint.  You got them crunchy things like Carvel?  Let me get some of that.  Let's go, Mitch!  What are you swinging at?  Come on!  How is that a slight?  Just going to rake the baby deep.  Shut up, please.  I can't watch a Met game without relaxing.  I was working.  I was writing today.  He's that guy. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  You know how hard it is to sit and think, hon?  He's hardcore, Met fan.  Hardcore.  I hate Clemens.  Who doesn't?  We all hate Clemens.  I'm a Yankee fan.  I hate Clemens fandom.  Jake is a Yankee fan.  We'll get him in here.  We'll talk about that.  I'm so, like, pissed that he got a ring with the Yankees.  Oh.  Oh.  You've got to be embarrassed to have that guy in the suit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, you're right.  What are you going to say?  What a fairy.  What are you going to say?  Oh, jeez, you didn't do that again. 
[02:25:00]  Piazza needs another bean ball.  I need to get out of my business.  I want to ring.  No.  Piazza's going to be, like, quirky.  He's getting beans in the head.  No wonder he's got to throw it a second.  Not for nothing, though.  Mike should.  He's six for nine.  Just go ape wild one day.  Yeah.  That's when he'll get seriously spit.  Like, if he came back to me, he should have just showed up at Yankee State in the middle  of the game while the Mets are at Shea.  Right through the corner.  Where is he? 
[02:25:30]  Where is he?  Stupid.  Very stupid.  Back up, jeez, now.  Pretty boy, back up.  Back to F.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No more beating me in the hay.  Yeah, he's going to be like Muhammad Ali.  Step up.  Deacon Fogon.  Yeah, I fumigate my house with Deacon Fogon.  That is the end of the Ali's functional period. 
[02:26:00]  You know, and you remember him as being like, I am the greatest.  I'm going to take him down.  There's going to be another.  Miller and Manila.  That's what they call me.  And then, hey, some years went by, gets them popped to the head, and then you see him.  Deacon Fogon.  So, fumigate your house, get rid of roaches with Deacon Fogon.  And now he's just like, I flow like a cinder blocker, sting like foam rubber.  I guess, where's Smolder and Joe Frazier?  And Joe's phone, the Muhammad Ali slow cooking grill. 
[02:26:30]  Phone range, you hit the guy next to him.  Bling.  Runs down a little punchy.  Hey, come on, man.  That poor guy.  That damn rope-a-dose did me in.  What a strategy.  I'll sit here and just have him punch me about the face until you get tired.  And then I'll beat the crap out of him.  Bling.  Ali pulling the rope-a-dose once again.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And now you see him.  They just kind of prop him up at events.  He's waving a little bit.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, my God.  He's helping his daughter with her fighting career.  With her fighting, so she can be a blithering idiot when she gets all the...  I don't get it.  It is very sad.  He's sparring with his daughter.  Oh, my God.  Honey, I do want you to learn from me the greatest, baby.  Because you just... 
[02:27:30]  Ow.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  You're doing fine, honey.  Try a couple of them body bills.  Oh, that...  Oh, don't hit...  Oh, I didn't see the face, baby.  What are you doing there, sweetheart?  Come to Papa.  Come to Papa.  Oh, look at that.  You're punching your daddy in the face.  He comes.  Oh, I don't see the old ball going.  Yeah.  All right, now, Papa's going to turn one on you.  You don't want to see your father.  I may be retail, but I can still burn. 
[02:28:00]  I've been fumigated.  Rain cells check out, and they never check back in.  It's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Poor son of a bitch, man.  Oh, my God.  You're passing out the whistle balls.  That's not a good sign.  Oh, I'm trying to...  Hey, we got a Piazza poster against the wall.  Nah, it didn't hit.  You got to hit him in the head.  Why are you throwing...  Oh, nice one.  Rick hit him right in the noggin.  Well, because he's a Yankee fan.  But why is Brewer throwing balls at my Piazza? 
[02:28:30]  And look at that.  And Piazza, just like...  If you notice, if you watch correctly and throw it wild, then it's going into the Yankee dugout.  And just like the real Piazza, he won't rush the mound at you, so don't worry.  It's just a poster.  It's just a poster.  Does he fall down and hit the ground?  That poor son of a bitch.  Todd, it's my Piazza for Decom ballgame.  That's right.  Oh, that was nice.  Stop hitting Piazza, man.  It's the Clemens game. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  Be Roger Clemens.  Be the rocket.  Piazza.  It's a very nice trick.  It's a little carnival game we have set up.  Oh, easy.  We were going to pour the other team up.  Well, they say we're, like, older.  Yeah.  You're going to be like a series, man.  If you know where you're taking from a batty old school, man, hit Jerry, man, hit Jerry.  Come on, guys.  It's just a game. 
[02:29:30]  I'm on the other bench.  I sucked in Little League.  I was too scared to get in the batter's vibe.  Yeah, that's a scary thing, man.  I'm just brushing him back a little bit.  Brushing him back.  I can't hit this.  Just strike me out.  I'm not even going to try because I'm out of the box by five feet.  I'm afraid of you.  I was the guy that got one hit all season and the whole place went nuts because I finally got a hit.  How was that guy?  I don't mean you got three chances, Opie.  Take your time.  There you go.  Nice hustle.  Yeah, and the umpwood keeps saying, closer to the plate, closer to the plate. 
[02:30:00]  I'm like, no.  I'm, like, way out of the box.  He's just going like this.  When I cast your face, I'm like, oh, God.  Walk your feet today, Opie.  Walk your feet today, Opie.  I was that guy.  I was right field guy.  Who in Little League could hit it to the right?  Good eye.  Good eye.  That one?  Yeah.  Oh.  I was no batter guy.  No batter.  No batter.  No batter.  You don't have to do it.  It's all right. 
[02:30:30]  Brian Regan's got that fit, man.  That's like, where you get up to bat and the whole outfield comes in.  Easy out.  Easy out.  Easy out.  Are you like the manager of the Bad News Bears?  The guy that he finally gets up at bat, you know, with the glasses.  He was carrying a clipboard all season.  Yeah.  Little League was just not my sport.  You know what's the worst, too, about that?  It's because, I mean, you are traumatized, I'm sure.  As a kid, you're up to bat, infield's coming in.  There's always a dad on, like, the other side called,  There you see out. 
[02:31:00]  You can't hit a giant joint right behind him.  Now he's taking it from the dad.  He's like, thanks, man.  That was the father of the pitcher.  He was always a son of a bitch.  He's head down right field, Johnny.  It wasn't.  Yeah, but I could not stand in the box.  No.  I hated that.  Yeah.  And it always seemed like, ah, it's coming right, coming right far.  It's coming right at me.  It's coming right at me.  The guy knows it.  So he's just going to hit me. 
[02:31:30]  It doesn't matter.  We'll tear the bejesus out of me.  Well, when you hit about seventh, eighth grade,  you get them kids that start getting the pubes and their teens taking children.  No.  Oh, dear.  Stop it.  Woo!  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes, Dr. Smith.  Yes, young William, a hairless young boy.  Woo!  Woo!  This kid's come back, and they've got half some stashes on him.  And next thing you know, it's like, last year you don't run out.  Wow!  He has filmed a lot. 
[02:32:00]  The kid's sporting the rolling fingers, the rolling fingers, mustache.  Yeah.  He's like, hey, where'd you get back, man?  He's just standing there.  Look right in the back.  Still don't have a hair in your sack.  It looks like an oven-stuffer roaster.  Yeah.  He's like, got the Fred Flintstone 5 o'clock shadow.  He's whaling them at you.  He's showing your friends.  I've got three to see.  Look at the long one.  Look at the long one.  I don't know what they're doing.  I know you wait until they're not looking.  You pluck one out of your head and go, look, man. 
[02:32:30]  I got it.  You pluck it out of the back of your head.  Look, man.  I'm sporting some things.  You know?  Yeah.  I got it.  Yeah, I got them.  One of mine's red.  Oh, my kid.  My sack looks like a clamshell.  Nick, I like nine, has other little ways.  Anthony, you're reliving my pet.  My whole, like, childhood.  Totally old yet.  Yeah, good.  Can we have the batty coach go see this one?  Good eye, man.  Good eye.  Good eye. 
[02:33:00]  Good eye.  You're pulling a rock in the 90 miles an hour.  I'm a 500-pound nine-year-old kid.  Leave me alone.  Yeah.  Well, that's when you held up on the outside or inside pitch, and you'd go, good eye.  And meanwhile, you didn't know.  You just didn't swing.  I don't know.  And you're like, oh, okay.  That was good, right?  Good eye.  I had no idea.  I was the fat kid with the glasses.  Looked like Roger Ebert.  Get out the batting key for me.  Easy out.  Easy out, guys.  I'm going to go through my pockets over there.  Easy out.  Easy out.  Put you wade into it, Billy. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Lean into it, man.  Oh, Brewer, by the way, your picture's in the paper.  I'm not getting you nothing, but you look hot, man.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God, dude.  I'm just kidding.  I love your act, though.  Let me go with you.  Good governance?  Yeah, man.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Later, Gary.  Yeah, Brewer, that's the governance.  We're hearing it might be sold out.  Yeah, that's what they told me yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Add more shows.  Add more shows.  Hey, dude, I'm 30.  I don't do that stuff no more.  No, huh?  Two shows.  Three shows.  Midnight, one o'clock. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  Billy Bob's story.  Billy Bob's story.  What do you say more, faggot?  That's what I thought.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You've got to get up.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Juan from the Bronx.  Get Brewer to pummel himself up out the face.  I love when he does that.  You know, I'm serious.  I might not even be able to do this.  Speaking of, I messed my neck up hard for it.  You wouldn't know it when I walked in, but.  So you're not going to be able to beat yourself up?  I'm going to try.  I've got serious painkillers. 
[02:34:30]  Wow.  That can make for a good show.  You pop a few painkillers before you go on stage.  Exactly.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh.  So the sex jokes.  Wait, what time is the show?  What about the guy who got struck out by the girl guy?  Oh, when they started allowing girls into Little League?  I never played with a chick.  No, no.  That was before that.  You're just talking about a guy that looks like a girl that was pitching and struck you  out.  No, because they've got girls that play now, and it's even worse, because then you've got 
[02:35:00]  to deal with your father going, yeah, let a girl strike you out.  Come on.  I'm going to help them beat your mother and show you how it's played.  I'm going to help them beat your mother and show you how it's played.  I'm going to help them beat your mother and show you how it's played.  You're stuck, and there's always that one father that kind of lets you get away with it.  All right, all right, don't worry about it.  But then he snapped that one time, but, oh, you're swinging it.  You're swinging it.  You're swinging it.  You're swinging it.  You're swinging it.  You're swinging it.  Come on.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you're losing.  The whole team is losing because of you. 
[02:35:30]  It's all being now.  Oh, I'm just a kid.  A day from Long Island.  Whenever Brewer imitates someone, he sounds like my mother-in-law taking a dump.  Okay, terrific.  We're going to talk about to take a nice bit, Tim.  The old, all right, walk it off.  Walk it off.  There you go.  Walk it off.  You got beans.  You had a face.  You don't know how to face.  You're just crying.  You don't know.  Walk it off.  It's okay. 
[02:36:00]  You got, like, the dirt from the base running, like, sucky tears on your eyes.  I'm not crying.  First face with your eyes, man.  Watch it all happen.  Pushy.  Faggot.  Nice swing, dick.  Yeah, it's a helpful thing.  There's always one guy on a sucky team.  He can tie it up.  The real hammer guy, yeah.  Going, faggot.  Save my office, dick. 
[02:36:30]  Save my office.  Save my office, dick.  He just pounded out of the park every time.  Save my office.  Save my office.  Save my office, man.  Come on.  Don't swing it up.  You understand?  Say, mom, dick.  Don't swing it up.  He's going wild.  What are you just saying?  What are you up here, moron?  I'm going to kick your ass if you strike out.  Save my office, dick.  I haven't heard that.  Boy, he truly is a legend of Valley Street. 
[02:37:00]  It's so Long Island.  Yeah, someone just wrote, Brewers in the studio, time to relive childhood Long Island memories.  John from Jersey.  Oh, I see.  John from Jersey.  When I played Little League, they would announce the batting averages when you got up.  When I got up, they announced no average.  Oh, and how bad did you feel when, like, the coach is telling you, all right, just choke up and make contact.  Right.  Like, no, I want to freaking hold it right at the end and swing this so it pounds it out of the park. 
[02:37:30]  Choke it up.  Just make contact.  Choke up.  No, choke a little higher.  There's more sticking out of the bottom of your hands than the top.  This guy, really heavy.  You look like a steel metal.  You look like Greg Diggio.  You look like Greg Diggio.  He's always crooked.  Too big for him.  Here's a ball.  Move your helmet.  Thank God, this guy.  My ear flap would get in the way of my vision.  Your head.  Man, you swing.  His beak comes out over your nose. 
[02:38:00]  Sorry, this is for the older kids.  Yeah, that's all he's for.  Jack Hammer only gave her $20 for shirts, guys.  Give me a break, all right?  I'm the one supporting this goddamn team.  Did you get your effing jacket?  Does it fade your names on it?  Then back off.  I collect garbage from your house, you little crap.  We're getting some great instant feedback.  Vinny from the Bronx.  Every time I'd get thrown out, the coach would slap me on the ass and say,  way to hustle. 
[02:38:30]  Way to hustle.  That was how he was going.  But Berger, the ground ball takes a bad hop at your face.  And the coach tells you, stay down on the ball.  It won't come up.  It comes up.  Yeah, it works when you're in the major league.  Yeah, you lay the glove down.  It hits the tip of your glove and pops right into your mug.  Ow!  You ever fall on your cup?  I'm not going to wear the cup.  First of all, you're waiting.  You're getting freaking...  I'm not going to wear my cup.  It was always ridiculous looking.  Oh, man. 
[02:39:00]  Not much in there to hold it in place.  Tiny, tiny little cup.  Yes, yes.  Send me about to your cup, my dear boy.  Oh, dear.  I was a fat kid.  I tried to slide once, you know, face forward.  Yeah.  I belly flopped so hard on my cup.  Because you know how the rubber's around it?  And it was digging so...  On your pew.  And it takes one party of nuts.  And you know, five seconds later, that pukey feeling's coming. 
[02:39:30]  And it goes...  You all right?  I'm all right, man.  I'm all right.  It's just for me.  Oh.  Sag it, try it.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Yes, the chant that we want a pitcher, not a belly itcher.  Jason from River Edge.  What about the father that would get into an argument and get thrown out of a freaking  low-way game?  We had a brawl after a game.  Really?  Coaches got to fight one another.  My dad is like 75.  He's on top of the guy.  He had him down. 
[02:40:00]  I swear to God, would you say that?  And all of a sudden, you heard like the ladies go,  Oh, my God, I didn't want a pitcher, just like this.  You turn around, and you see these kids fighting all of a sudden.  It's the coaches.  Oh, there's just the worst thing.  Knocking the crap out of one another.  And then, I don't know, my dad had some guy down.  And it just knocked the crap out of one another.  Just, I don't know, maybe they didn't like it.  I don't know.  What happened?  Yeah.  You know you suck when, you know you can't hit when the parents cheer when you hit a foul  ball.  You know? 
[02:40:30]  You're like, yeah.  All right, man.  There you go.  Oh, good one.  Good one.  I wish I could even do that.  I had one hit.  I had one hit to right field.  I closed my eyes and flunked, and I lucked out.  How are we going to play now?  Who are you to challenge in the ball?  It's a wiffle ball.  I can do wiffle ball.  I can't do, you know, baseball coming at me.  I got over it.  This is when I was like 10, 11, 12 years old.  Oh, man.  Here's a quote.  When you lose the game, we'll get them next time.  Yeah.  We'll get them next time.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  Josh from Wantall. 
[02:41:00]  What about the Mesh hats that you couldn't creep and the Joe Fishmarket sponsors on the  back of the jersey?  Dan from Massive people.  They're all coming from Long Island now.  Little League was the reason why I wound up playing Dungeons and Dragons.  I always loved when the star player forgot his mitt or stirrups, and the coach would tell  the benchwarmer to give up his stuff to the star player.  That's so true, man.  That's a great one.  Let's see.  We always made fun of the kid who couldn't get cleats and always wore the basketball shoes. 
[02:41:30]  And they wore the green.  Yeah, yeah.  Crazy color.  Radio Pimp writes, what about the courage clap whenever a kid went down and got hurt?  The best is when there are extra players and they send you to deep center field.  You end up standing so far back that you're in the parking lot.  I had a kid named Diermid.  Diermid?  Diermid.  D-I-A-R-M-U-I-D.  And no one for some reason can pronounce his name.  I swear to God I'm not making this up.  So the coach would call him Dammit. 
[02:42:00]  And my mom called him Dammit.  I swear to God, wasn't you Dammit?  They were in Kent Avenue Memorial.  And Diermid's in left field.  And the coach's going, Dammit, move back!  Dammit!  Dammit, pay attention!  Swear to my mother.  And that lady goes, don't you swear in front of these goddamn kids!  What do you do?  Goddamn.  Goddamn, I made up.  I'm not going to lie to you. 
[02:42:30]  He turns out, it's the kid's name, lady.  Dammit, move in!  I think we played for the same little league organization, man.  It was out of Long Island.  They were all the same.  Babe Ruth, right?  After you hit a foul ball.  Good cut.  Straighten it out next time.  Straighten it out.  Thanks, Scott.  Yeah.  Oh, it's that easy?  Dan from Seaford.  How about the sadistic coach that put you at first base to gain confidence, five errors  in one inning?  I've pitched once for like three batters in a second. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  I lost two guys and one got knocked the daylights out of it.  I almost started crying.  I'm such a fairy.  He's getting my arm hurt.  He never pitched again, ever.  We've got a guy that played little league with you on line four.  Yeah?  Let's talk to Charlie.  Charlie, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Jimmy.  What's up, Hammer?  Charlie Brogher, man.  What's up, Hammer?  Not much.  What are you up to?  Hey.  What?  Who was the Babe Ruth on our team, man?  Who was the Babe Ruth?  In the younger years, I was the Babe Ruth. 
[02:43:30]  That's it, man.  I was, man.  I was really fat.  Man, you look up all over that.  Little fat ass in right field to get it.  Oh, I'm in the game, man.  You throw rocks around at first base.  I was so bored.  I was really fat.  I'd just pick up rocks and throw it at all my infielders.  I feel, Babe.  You see how far you hit that ball?  Charlie, didn't we win one year?  Yeah, we did. 
[02:44:00]  The best day.  That was, uh...  Man, I don't even remember back then.  No, we were way back.  Cold, Charlie.  Hey, man.  All right.  Keep in touch, man.  All right.  You got it, man.  How's it going?  Thank you, Charlie.  Hey, come to the village, man.  All right.  I'll come down.  All right, man.  Yeah.  What village?  He meant the village of Valley Street.  Valley Street.  Yes, of course.  We'll back me up on that.  We'll back you up in that village.  We'll. 
[02:44:30]  More instant feedback before we move on.  We got Stephen Lynch coming into the studio.  Yeah.  I'm running here.  Stephen Lynch has arrived.  My friend's father was thrown out of the park for being drunk.  Between innings, he would go out to his car and chug a beer.  By the fourth or fifth inning, he was bombed.  He'd come back in the third inning.  Game over?  What do we do?  The car ride home. 
[02:45:00]  We'll be there.  We call it.  Rain's coming.  He's critiquing.  You're playing.  You don't smell him like dad's beer breath.  Oh, my God.  Dad's beer breath.  He's on the wrong little league team.  Come on, Jimbo.  Keep down in the box.  He's on field five.  He's over field two.  Yeah, I look like my little bastard for a second.  I'm going to lay all like the same old.  A couple more here.  Remember when you lost?  The team with Chad 2, 4, 6, 8.  Who do we appreciate?  I hate him.  And then the team name?  Yeah, I effing appreciate getting my ass kicked. 
[02:45:30]  Now, take me to Dairy Queen.  You'd have to high five or like shake hands.  The line goes by and one kid would put in a, you suck.  Spit on the hand.  He goes, you suck.  Shut up.  Spit on the hand.  Yeah, right.  I'm going to shake hands.  She's cool, dick.  I'm going to rub my own junk before I shake your hand, man.  It seems like he's giving me a hand.  It's the same thing.  Smell it.  I'm going to give myself the same thing.  You're watching. 
[02:46:00]  I've got a long A-jube there.  Jay from Nutley.  How about the fat catcher who sweated from the car ride to the game?  Yeah, but you loved when you came.  Oh, great job here, man.  Or the kid who wore jeans in practice.  All right.  Another memory.  Thanks, bro.  Yeah.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, did I hear you say you used to play softball?  I mean, you couldn't play softball, but you couldn't play softball.  No, no.  Well, first of all, we're talking about, no, regular baseball. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, so you can play baseball, but you could play whistleball?  As in the whistleball, that's Allen's?  Oh, yeah.  That old dad.  You're reaching.  You know when one of the listeners has a good little jab at one another, we laugh.  We laugh partially at it.  It didn't cut it.  There you go.  There you go, Will.  Well, excuse me, but I do believe that stuff's ass. 
[02:47:00]  Carmen has focused.  We're going to the left.  All right.  You're married with him.  Can we see your stuff?  Oh, what's that?  Easy.  Can we see your stuff?  Can we see your stuff?  Guys, guys, I'm...  Shut up.  All right, I get it, Ed, I guess.  I would choke the chicken in front of everybody. 
[02:47:30]  Really?  This one's sick.  Dan from Manhattan, what about the one gay coach with no wife, no children,  that always had the really good kids over his house for a pool party at the end of the year?  Come on, I'm taking you all out for pizza.  Years later, you found out he was the town drunk and molester.  You were from Lawrence.  Huh?  Gee, like having your backseat.  Oh, and then, you wanted to have sex with me?  Yes. 
[02:48:00]  All right, we've got to take a break.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we'll take some someone off.  Oh, you're yelling to me.  Yeah, yeah.  We're out of control.  We're so lazy.  All right, knock it off.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the ONHL.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number. 
[02:48:30]  Well, Anthony, we've got to get into Mike Tyson.  Well, you can get into Mike Tyson.  I'm getting into you.  Without any noob.  This guy is downright scary.  He's a madman.  He is an insane madman.  And they know it.  Like, they keep him all doped up until he's got to fight.  Well, what is he taking?  He's taking, like, Zoloft or something.  I have no doubt pretty good. 
[02:49:00]  And, you know, a couple weeks leading up to the fight or a week leading up to the fight,  they take him off his stuff.  So he's a lunatic in the ring.  Yeah.  So he'll kill you.  So he's fighting Andrew Gulotta, who's just a big scumbag.  And he deserves whatever tights he can throw at him.  Gulotta?  One of the dirtiest fighters in the history of boxing, Rich.  Oh, yeah.  Up against such an upstanding guy.  Oh, I understand that.  That's why this is going to be a pretty good fight.  Yeah.  Gulotta likes to hit guys in the ballies. 
[02:49:30]  That's his whole move.  He's wrecked his whole career by hitting guys in the ballies when he's winning fights.  So he's just as psychotic as Tyson.  Yeah, he's kind of insane.  He's like a blockhead.  But no one beats the Tyson.  Anyway, we got some Tyson audio.  Yeah.  And I don't know what he's trying to say.  Maybe someone could figure it out.  He doesn't have his mental faculties anymore. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know if he ever did.  He's crazy.  Listen to some of this stuff.  How is this going to end?  Thank you, Tyson.  I don't know.  I feel he'll have to be destroyed.  That's what I'm thinking.  Maybe he'll break a leg.  Yeah.  Destroyed?  They break a leg and put him out the stud or something.  I don't know.  But I'm thinking he'll have to be destroyed.  Do you think we could revert back to a movie to explain your point a little better?  Do you talk about being destroyed?  Let me think.  I could revert to King Kong. 
[02:50:30]  Where he was on the...  He was on the...  Well, I just saw it the other day.  The original.  All right.  You're right.  When he got to New York, there's unfamiliar surroundings for Kong, you know?  And it kind of freaked him out.  And, you know, women freak Kong out.  And he wound up climbing up the Empire State Building.  And they had to send the planes in and destroy him.  And that's what I'm saying is going to have to happen to my Tyson. 
[02:51:00]  So if I follow you here, you think eventually that Tyson's going to climb the Empire State Building.  There's going to be helicopters around in planes.  And that's going to be his demise.  No, it's more figuratively, I'm saying it.  Not literally.  It could be the world tradesman.  There's going to be a white woman in the world.  There could be.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's a great bit.  What I'm saying is, you know, somebody as angry as Mike Tyson,  I could equate his situation to any movie.  I could revert to a lot of movies. 
[02:51:30]  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  But King Kong just popped in my head.  What I'm saying is, just an angry guy like that.  And, sorry, a lot of guys reverting to other movies.  You might not have hit the movie on the head with that.  All right.  Let's try to see what people are reverting to.  Rich is reverting to a movie.  Rich?  Hey, guys, I have the perfect movie.  Old Yeller.  Old Yeller.  At the end, he gets rabies.  He goes nuts and I've got to shoot him.  There you go.  Mike Tyson is like Old Yeller with rabies. 
[02:52:00]  Because he started kind of, like, normal in a way.  Yeah, everybody likes him in the beginning.  As far as fighters go.  Oh, Mike Tyson.  Yeah.  Because he's yellow.  And at the end, they just got to shoot him because he's nuts.  And thanks, Rich, you bastard.  I never saw that movie.  I was going to rank it tomorrow.  You just ruined the ending of Old Yeller for me, you son of a bitch.  Thank you, Rich.  All right.  Tell him.  That's pretty funny, though.  I heard Bruce Willis was dead during the entire movie Old Yeller.  Ah, Chris, what's up?  Yeah, George.  Why is this?  He's going around fighting people and you just shoot them at the end.  Oh, okay.  He's fighting people. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, okay.  I can't.  You didn't pick on anything.  You didn't pick up on that one that way?  I didn't know which part of Jaws you were referring to, but that makes perfect sense.  He bites people, so we ought to stick some compressed air in his mouth and shoot it with a rifle.  That would be it.  Yeah, it's it.  All right.  Yeah, that's all.  All right, Chris, you're next on N.E.W.  I think Star Wars.  Star Wars.  You said you had a pilot down on time and watched Ted explode.  They said you had a giant death star.  Remember the last audio that talked about when you said, eat a banger, holy-filled children?  Yeah, eat a banger, holy-filled children.  I mean, eat your children. 
[02:53:00]  Man, that's crazy.  I don't know.  I'm thinking more, you know, things like Old Yeller.  Yeah.  King Kong.  Mighty Joe Young.  Like that.  You know, in that vein.  Look at me.  I've been embarrassed.  Humiliation, degradation, and any other TIO in you can name that's negative, right?  But listen, and you were asking me why I'm angry, why I'm like this, and all of a sudden  I look back and retrospective and say, oh, man, I've been devastated.  And the only thing you can say is that I'm paid, I'm rich, and my life and soul's been 
[02:53:30]  tore apart.  I love you, too.  What the hell did he just say?  I think Muhammad Ali makes more sense.  Holy Lord.  He's all full of them.  Oh, no.  Someone's reverting to the movie, the fly, with the Brundle fly, lifting the guys on 
[02:54:00]  moth when I'm wrestling.  Yeah.  See?  That's a perfect example.  Let's try to go back to the audio, all right?  Anthony?  Look, it's pervasive that I'm typically an animal, so I really think, you know, it's been  so pervasive, they really believe in it, so I guess they only enjoy me being an animal  in the ring, because I'm sure there are nine million people that watch me probably hate  my dress, and most of them are probably white.  But listen, right?  But it's cool, though, right?  But I don't know.  I probably hate them, too.  Okay, terrific. 
[02:54:30]  Here's one where Tyson loses his train of thought.  I feel uncomfortable with the fact that he's not here, and I can't say it in his face.  But, yeah, he's going to feel some pain.  I know probably he's mad that I ain't going to wait on him.  I wouldn't know waiting again, but, oh, God, it's beautiful.  It's a good day today, you know?  But listen, right?  Go ahead, man.  Go ahead.  What?  Wow.  What was that?  All right.  Okay.  What else is there to say on that one?  He's just a nut. 
[02:55:00]  That is another, like, life form that is just able to speak English.  Like, that's another type of mammal on this planet that just happens to speak some, what,  a little bit of English, just a piece of English.  Like, if you walked up to a dog and said hello and it went, hello, it's like the same thing.  This guy is crazy.  Tyson talking about Zoloft, the drug that he's on, until he has to fight, they take 
[02:55:30]  him off it so he can be a lunatic in the ring.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Oh, my God.  Zoloft is the cage, is the virtual cage that this guy is in.  He takes it to keep from killing y'all.  Y'all.  He just threatened the world.  Right.  Like, he's taking that and pretty much threatened the world. 
[02:56:00]  He's killing y'all.  He just challenged the world.  He's like Godzilla.  He could just come out of Tokyo Bay and just destroy cities off of this Zoloft.  Thank God for Zoloft.  Who invented that?  Give him a medal.  He saved the world.  He saved humanity.  Imagine that.  A true American hero.  Absolutely.  I don't think enough credit's been given to the Zoloft creator. 
[02:56:30]  He saved humanity from the lives of Mike Tyson trying to kill y'all.  I cannot classify him as a human being.  He's going to kill somebody.  He is.  It's a matter of time.  I've been taking off the Zoloft.  Yeah, I've got to hear that one again.  Yeah.  To keep from killing y'all.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Here's Mike off the Zoloft. 
[02:57:00]  There he is, turning off her jeep.  Fighting through the floor of jeep to try to get small children.  Come on out of there.  I'm off the Zoloft.  Come here.  Look at the kids in the jeep and they cute little white kids.  I'm going to bite this tire.  Don't shine that light in my pupils.  And I think we have audio of Mike Tyson singing. 
[02:57:30]  Tyson singing?  Yeah.  I'm on the Zoloft. 
[02:58:00]  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  What?  What?  Ain't that someone?  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  I don't know who you think you're going to do.  But it's not his life.  Let's not fight what you do.  But you're going to fight yourself.  Let me make you see someone else.  So we all fucking love yourself.  But that's what you're doing. 
[02:58:30]  I don't know who you think you're going to do.  I don't know who you think you're going to do.  That's why you're laying on your back.  Looking at the proof of this stuff.  People telling the truth of this thing.  Now I'm going to make me lose my mind.  Up in there.  Up in there.  Now I'm going to make me go on out.  Up in there.  Up in there.  Now I'm going to make me act a fool.  Up in there.  Up in there.  That's the thickest sound ever. 
[02:59:00]  I eat people, dogs, I don't care.  Mothers and their babies, I will eat everybody.  You're going to make me lose my mind.  Mike has a translation on line 11.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, I think he was trying to talk about how much he loves his family and he hates the  white people.  I mean, I've got to revert back to Jurassic Park 2, Lost World. 
[02:59:30]  We should track his ass up and send him back out to the island.  The only way we're going to be safe.  All right.  Yeah, make the island and track his ass up.  I've got to get back to Skull Island.  Thank you, Mike.  Somebody was mad at me for giving the ending to King Kong.  DC from Staten Island, right?  Oh, and hey, does Tyson take pills of Zoloft or is he giving it with a tranquilizer gun?  Look at that bugger.  Does someone have to tell him that he's got to go back on the Zoloft after the fight? 
[03:00:00]  I don't think he's doing it on his own.  Yeah, really.  Imagine I'm here to take this.  Like, what, you're trying to give me poison?  Because he says, like, his trainers and stuff take him off the Zoloft, so they're taking  the pills away.  Who's the brave soul that has to tell him, well, all right, Mike, fight's over.  Probably just inject it in the big piece of raw meat they throw into his cage after the  fight.  Swap.  Oh, I feel better.  Okay, hit me out.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's happening? 
[03:00:30]  You guys can't possibly think that's a good drug.  Anthony owns Shane.  It's the greatest drug.  Someone goes off it.  They kill people.  Really?  Free Hartman killed Bill Hartman when she went off the drug.  Yeah, and she was like a quiet little girl.  Imagine what type you can do off the drug.  That's what I'm saying.  He's true.  He will kill us all.  I think he's a military experiment.  They're giving him the Zoloft, and then if we ever get into war with someone, they take  him off and parachute him in behind enemy lines, and he just tears up the city.  It would work well.  He's like Gorgo. 
[03:01:00]  Gorgo.  I'm a Gorgo.  Oh, my God.  The Godzilla ripoff.  Remember that?  Gorgo with the little fin ears and everything.  I forgot all about Gorgo.  He's Gorgo.  You're the mellowest creature in the world.  You're like a tame rabbit.  And they take Tyson off of it to fight.  That's what I'm saying.  This should be illegal.  I thought I could bring a gun into the ring.  This should be a huge fence around the ring so it doesn't hurt the spectators.  A cage match. 
[03:01:30]  Only the audience is in the cage.  Right.  Come on out, you pussies.  I'll chew right through that chain link.  Hey, Mr. Tyson.  Yeah?  While we have you in the studio, how do you spell Zoloft?  Zoloft.  R-O-L-A-I-D-S.  I don't know.  How do you spell it?  I don't know, but you better give me some quick.  Why do I have this tag in my ear?  I woke up with a tag in my ear with a number and a radio transmitter on my back.  I think that is to track my migration habits. 
[03:02:00]  They want to know where my goals in between fights.  I like in the warm weather, I go north.  And in the cold weather, I go south.  And they track me with my little antenna on my back.  But sometimes I rub against a tree and dislodge it, and they have to tranquilize me.  And put a new transmitter on my back. 
[03:02:30]  That's when I need more Zoloft.  You ever see him do that on the Wild Kingdom show with the bear?  They give him the tranquilizer, and all of a sudden his lip just all loopy and his tongue sticks out of his mouth?  You ought to see when the Mike Tyson looks like that.  They had to pull me out of a cave once with a come-along.  And they measured me and pulled one of my poofers out.  To see how old I was. 
[03:03:00]  And they woke me up.  And you should have saw them back just run when I started coming through.  They ran for the hills.  They were petrified.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that.  But you need to keep killing y'all.  Yeah.  You better give me more.  I remember once I was looking for food at the local dump.  And it was dangerous for the children, so they put me in a cage on the back of a pickup truck and relocated me. 
[03:03:30]  But I kept coming back because that was some tasty-ass garbage.  You can't keep me away from a good old Swanson TV dinner half-eating thing at the dump.  I love that.  I got one for you.  Yeah.  You think that Crocodile Hunter has balls? 
[03:04:00]  Give him some Zoloft and have him wrestle with Tyson.  Give him the Zoloft to calm him down.  Then I would be impressed.  Who knows goddamn alligators he's wrestling with?  Crocodiles are pussies.  Right.  They can't even punch.  Damn Crocodile Hunter.  Let's see you take care of Tyson.  Get some Zoloft in him.  You know, the funny thing about the Tyson jaw is its power isn't in opening.  It's in closing.  So you can actually hold it shut with your bare hands, but don't let it open because I'll take your fingers off. 
[03:04:30]  Fingers off, Zoloft, whatever.  It's on the floor.  I know.  Come here, you little wussy-fancy.  He's ready to go into a death fight.  He's ready to go into a death row.  All right.  I'm reverting myself to Hannibal Lecter. 
[03:05:00]  I need like a muzzle or something.  Some Zoloft.  Let's take a break.  All right.  And we'll be back.  It's time.  It's time.  The OPA tent installation.  The show block.  Block.  Block.  Block.  Block.  Block.  Block.  The OPA tent installation.  Block.  Block. 
[03:05:30]  Block.  The show blog.  Monkey ad.  And the other.  Above you.  OPA.  OPA.  OPA.  OPA.  Answer me.  Answer me.  Uh, Lois, what's going on? 
[03:06:00]  What about the thing about kids having all sex in the bathroom or something like that?  Yeah, we can talk about that. It's in the post today.  But how about that?  Yeah, there's an article by Andrea, I don't know, Pizer, Pizer, Pizer, whatever.  It says, uh, kindergarten sex games, one mom's nightmare.  Yeah.  Now, Ann was talking earlier about dry humping in elementary school.  Yeah, like sixth grade, though, you know.  You start, uh, start rocking around that age. 
[03:06:30]  Some of the kids, you know.  I'm a late woman, man.  Even in kindergarten, there was a little bit of action going on,  but it was, uh, just a showing, uh, I remember walking to a girl's house and showing behind.  Showing heinie, showing heinie.  I, I did the, show me your heinie.  I go, I go to the house, and the mother would come to the door.  I don't even remember, you know.  Oh, can you and Mary come out and play?  Yeah, okay.  Went around back by the porch and kind of went, you know, in the corner.  And she'd pull her pants down, and I'd look at her ass, and she would want me to do the same. 
[03:07:00]  To do that, you know, I just, that was like, hey, thanks.  Thank you, honey.  That was sex.  That was sex.  That was pretty much it.  Ooh, got to go for a six-year-old, right?  Got to go.  All right, so this article, uh, kindergarten, uh, sex games, one mom's nightmare.  I can't believe this is going on in the, in the, in the public school company.  I can.  I can.  Seriously?  Oh, yeah.  Get out of here.  Dude, let's just say, because I don't want to get into anything.  Uh, that's, uh, I don't want to make this discussion change gears, but there's a certain segment 
[03:07:30]  of society where this is happening.  Oh, no.  Let me just say that.  It is.  Sound the alarm.  There's a, I'm not going to say what segment.  Oh, no.  I'm staying out of things.  What a doodle.  I'm staying out of trouble.  Okay.  I believe it's the Irish.  It is.  Yeah.  The kindergarten Irish are getting drunk.  No.  Oh, my God.  I know.  It's cute.  I might have to go to that.  Oh, no, no, no.  Yes. 
[03:08:00]  Yes.  All right.  Listen.  All right.  So the article starts, uh, as he sent her five-year-old son to kindergarten in Tony Riverdale,  Shoshana gave him a gentle warning.  Sorry.  It's just a funny name, I guess.  Boy, if that doesn't help any argument.  What?  Anyway, I didn't say anything either.  Shoshana gave him a gentle warning.  Yeah.  Her five-year-old son going to kindergarten.  Never let an adult touch you there, is what she said to a five-year-old. 
[03:08:30]  Okay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, uh, the little boy heeded his mom's advice, but her words didn't go far enough.  Slowly, the stories trickled out of P.S. 24 in the Bronx.  Alarming stuff.  The boy talked about games in the schoolyard.  Naked games.  Games also were played in the school bathroom, involving acts more commonly associated with  the president of the United States than with five-year-old P.S. 
[03:09:00]  Ha!  What, were they signing bills into law?  I believe the five-year-olds were, uh, well, doing what, you know, with alarm, Shoshana realized  that the males who posed the threat to her son were not adults, Anthony.  They learned it from me, okay?  They learned it from me.  Uh, let's see.  Her precious boy was being sexually molested by other five-year-olds.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  My huggy, my seven-year-old. 
[03:09:30]  No, no, it's another five-year-old.  Oh, okay.  We're not talking pedophiles here today.  My husband and I were in shock, Shoshana told me.  I was crying.  Never in my life did I imagine that this could be done by other kids.  Timber!  Shoshana, this doesn't sound right.  Shoshana, a travel agent worker originally from Israel, hey, wow, when did that happen?  I don't know.  That screws everything up.  She thought she could trust her son in public school. 
[03:10:00]  So she talked to other parents about what was going on in the school.  The revelations were astounding, Shoshana said.  A mother with a boy in kindergarten told Shoshana that another child had grabbed her son's junk in the schoolyard.  Whoa.  A third mother relayed a similar tale about group sex play in the bathroom.  Hmm.  Wow.  Some blame the media.  Enough with blaming the media.  Some blame the Internet. 
[03:10:30]  Internet.  Five-year-olds on the Internet going to porn sites, right?  You ready to count on that one?  Where?  Where are you going?  Some blame the media, the Internet.  Right.  Or the parents.  But how can you explain a pack of seven-year-old Harlem boys who recently forced a little girl to perform oral sex?  No, I can't say it.  I can't say it.  I just stopped myself.  You know what?  The first time I just stopped myself.  You don't have to be, uh...  You don't have to be so obvious. 
[03:11:00]  What?  Who the...  Please, is there somebody who doesn't know who we're talking about out there, please?  Anyone?  Right.  Kimmy doesn't.  My goodness.  No.  Rick, don't even.  The NOW organization checking in, it said damn well.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yes, that's the evil out there.  I think they learned it from their parents.  Or parents.  You know what I mean? 
[03:11:30]  If there's a kindergarten kid, and he's in an apartment building or something,  and mom's is, mom is, mom is, mom is having the sex and stuff in front of everybody.  Uh-huh.  You know, sometimes that happens.  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Well, Ant, that certain statement of society you speak of, aren't he 17 still in kindergarten?  Oh, my God. 
[03:12:00]  I've got to hang up on him.  I apologize to our faithful listeners.  No, not one description of anybody that we're talking about is going to get through today.  I swear to you.  Wendy, what's going on?  Hey, um, fourth play in first grade.  Hmm.  Catholic Grammar School.  Uh, teacher put two guys together.  I was sitting next to a boy.  And, well, not sexual at all.  It's Johns with you.  I didn't really know what that was at that time.  But kind of playing around with the old hand down there.  What, him on you or you on him? 
[03:12:30]  Him on me.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  And what was it, the teacher?  No, no, no.  Oh, oh, it was another student.  No, not a student, but the teacher had us sitting in the back next to each other.  In first grade, he was petting a poodle?  Yeah, first grade.  I didn't even know what, you know, it was really long.  I just was really serious.  How about that?  I don't know.  Well, that's it.  Where were you loose girls when I was in first grade? 
[03:13:00]  All right.  Thank you, Wendy.  You're welcome.  Let's go to Jessie.  Jessie, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  My sister's in junior high school, and a whole bunch of her friends got caught in the  hall giving hummers to a whole bunch of cemeterate guys, and now they're having assemblies  and stuff that they have to teach the kids that it's wrong to do it in the high school.  What a great school that would be to go to.  Oh, my God.  What was it happening in junior high?  Like, you'd have to work and get a girlfriend and, you know, go through all the proper channels. 
[03:13:30]  It wasn't like, oh, there's the third period bell, let me just get a cookie and then go  into class.  Or collect enough money from your paper out there to go buy one.  Wow.  What's going on, huh?  Pretty sick.  Thank you.  Welcome.  Bye.  Bye.  Just right.  I guess there was a girl that was telling the kindergarten story with a boy that was  heading on the hotel.  Yeah.  Dale from Jersey saying, I'm betting Wood's Law. 
[03:14:00]  We got a counselor on the line.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got a good one for you.  Yeah.  When I was younger, I was a camp counselor.  I was like a counselor in training.  So we're at the pool.  One of the lifeguards, I'm talking to her, we look over.  There's two little boys just sitting up against the fence.  They're like kissing each other and touching each other all over.  We walk up to them.  We're like, what the hell are you guys doing?  They go, oh, nothing.  We're just playing googies.  Playing googies.  I was like, what the hell is this? 
[03:14:30]  Playing googies.  Joe, I bet you not.  Very good.  Joe Soprano checking in, Anthony, from foundrymusic.com.  These are the kind of people that yell in the movie theaters, right?  I know, Jesus.  Joe's just trying to figure out who you're talking about, Anthony.  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, Glenn.  Yes, hey, what's happening?  What's up?  No, I think you can't play the little African-American kids.  They probably, you know. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  They probably got junk like grown-ups, you know.  We're not talking about anyone specifically here on the program.  No.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  I just wanted to, you know, add in, you know, I'm almost 30 years old, and this is nothing  new, you know.  This stuff goes on all the time.  When I was six years old, I had a girl, you know, I remember I had her in the bathroom,  and I was like, I was telling her to kiss, you know, my junk. 
[03:15:30]  No, I didn't say junk.  Oh, yeah?  I was telling her to kiss it, and then by the time I was 10, by the time I was 10, I had  a girl, you know, suck my junk, you know, so, I mean, and, you know, I didn't get it  from my parents or anything.  I just think it's kind of like instinctual, you know, like you just...  Instinctual?  Really, Spaz?  Well, I don't know.  Instinctual.  Well, all right, that's, you got me there.  That's a Spaz-ism. 
[03:16:00]  No, I think it's instinctive, you know, I think it's instinctive that, you know, there's  certain, there's a sexual instinct that you have, a sexual drive.  Right.  No, I don't think it comes from, like, you know, the Internet or the wow or anything  like that.  Yeah, but there, it might be instinctual, but, you know, I believe you kind of know in your  head what's appropriate and what's not, even in kindergarten, you know what I mean?  Like, like, you're showing each other the heiny thing.  Even we at that age knew that no one could see us do it because it was kind of like a 
[03:16:30]  taboo right to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Well, all right.  I just wanted to chime in, guys.  Take care.  I love you, Sean.  Thanks, Brian.  One time at band camp.  That was a great, great scene.  I don't know.  It always seems like it's the schools that aren't in the best neighborhoods.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen elsewhere.  I'm just saying every time I read about it, it seems to be a certain neighborhood. 
[03:17:00]  I had no clue I could get action in kindergarten.  You couldn't?  How do you know?  What kind of action?  You see gang BJs in the bathroom?  That's a miracle thing.  You couldn't even go to the bathroom in kindergarten.  Wasn't the bathroom like in the same class?  It was in the classroom.  That's right.  You raised your hand, you went to the bathroom, you were done.  Did you remember to wipe your mouth? 
[03:17:30]  You know, new little rules.  We're going to learn about BJs today, boys and girls.  Hi, it's your old pal, Barney.  No, show Barney where the person touch you.  Look at that.  Look at it grow.  The voice is turning a shade of purple just like Barney.  Oh, boy, oh, boy. 
[03:18:00]  We're having fun today, kids, aren't we?  Here comes Baby Bop.  Oh, boy.  Boy, he's got a dinosaur in his pants, too.  Oh, yes, goodness.  Now, just keep kissing.  That's it.  You kiss him all over.  Go, boys.  I'm going to do you right in your Harry Potter. 
[03:18:30]  No.  Now, don't forget to swallow.  Bye-bye.  And remember, I love you.  The purple-headed monster.  And it's not Barney.  Look what I did to you again.  Dude, I love you.  Bend over, Baby Bop.  I'm going to slam your back door. 
[03:19:00]  Come here.  Come here, Mary.  This is called prison mood.  That's what we used in the joint.  Suck it.  Suck it, you bitch.  Look at Barney's yam bag.  It's big and purple.  Oh, boy. 
[03:19:30]  Remember to always drink your banana juice.  Ah, just like Baby Bop.  Okay, girls.  We're going to play on the monkey bars as Barney lays here underneath, looking up to spot you.  Oh, look at that, baby.  Little whore.  Oh, boy. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, Rick, get out of here.  Just leave.  You are disgusting.  All right, Crazy B from Jersey.  Crazy B from Jersey.  I'm going to have some feedback.  I can one-up all these callers, Anthony.  All right.  When I was in the womb, I would reach down and, you know, pet mommy's panty perch.  Great.  Willie Anderson's taking in. 
[03:20:30]  I still play googies.  Show me googies.  Yeah.  No, he didn't play.  Bringing googies into comedy.  Yeah.  Googies.  I usually get a big load of googies in my mouth.  God damn, Willie.  Okay, we have to take a break.  Oh, sure.  Sure.  Yes, yes, we do. 
[03:21:00]  The O.P.M.  The Anthony Show.  Who else did you a plus of pills that makes a team that you could see for the truth of their hands?  What a good one for a new team.  Oh, come on.  Are you going to arrest a boy or a bus?  No, we need it.  Oh, wow.  O.P.  What did you learn on the show today?  I mean, really not too much, Derek. 
[03:21:30]  Anything useful, honey.  What did you learn on the show today?  I mean, absolutely nothing.  I see more brain cells.  What did you learn on the show today?  What I learned today, the fish still sucks.  Nothing there.  That's a new show.  What did you learn on the show today?  The O.P.M.  The O.P.M.  The O.P.M.  Hello, ma'am.  This is Lieutenant Columbo.  I got a couple of questions to ask you.  Could you shove your fist up my... 
[03:22:00]  I'd love it if you could just stick your fist up my...  Listen, get your husband over here.  We'll pop my eye out.  And he just go...  Could you do that, please?  Just go...  I'd love that.  Mrs. Columbo, he pulls out a big...  Rips my eye out and just shoves that thing right to my brain.  I'd love it.  All right, thank you.  Oh, oh, pardon me.  One more thing, man.  One more.  Bury your boot up my... 
[03:22:30]  Could you do that?  And could you just grab my...  And twist it like a threshold.  I'd love if you grab my...  Grab my shriveled old Columbo...  And twist that thing like a friction.  Okay, ma'am.  I gotta get back to the precinct now.  Oh, before I leave.  One more thing.  Could you do?  Man, one more thing.  Put my...  In a vice.  Could you just glance down on my...  And squeeze until they come out of the hole in my head that used to have an eye? 
[03:23:00]  Oh, Columbo.  Oh, don't you have to go arrest Martin Landau.  I was in a series once with Martin Landau.  And after the show, after the shoot, as they call it, I jammed my fist so far up his...  I actually pulled out his process.  It was wonderful.  We used to film at Universal Studios.  And we'd all get together in the comment section.  And pound each other. 
[03:23:30]  And pound each other.  But there's a piece.  I'm going to say this.  This story, the headlines, spanking, cure for neck ache. 
[03:24:00]  What?  This is a sick story, too.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this. </pre>
