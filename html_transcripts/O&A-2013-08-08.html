<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in extremely vulgar and sexually explicit conversation, contrasting their perceived audience (middle-aged, blue-collar men, as suggested by a former program director) with their actual teenage listeners.  The conversation then shifted to Anthony Weiner's political career and his use of the term "Grandpa" to describe an opponent, sparking a debate on ageism and societal perceptions of aging and retirement.  A significant portion focused on the KTVU news prank involving fake, offensive names for the Asiana Airlines crash pilots, discussing the ensuing firings and perceived racial bias.  The hosts then detailed their successful intervention in a SiriusXM internal matter, resulting in the reinstatement of staff member Troy Kwan.

Next, they discussed Howard Stern's show, speculating on the impact of a new COO, Marcy, and Stern's perceived shift towards mainstream content.  Humorous anecdotes from their own show, including a co-worker's misunderstanding of a recurring bit, were shared.  The upcoming appearance at a Juggalo event was mentioned, along with comments on Sam Roberts' unusually well-dressed appearance.  A subsequent segment detailed Juggalos stealing makeup from Walmart, prompting the store to shrink-wrap its entire makeup section.  This transitioned into discussion of Jimmy’s upcoming trip to the Gathering of the Juggalos, possibly with Charlie Murphy and Dante Nero.

Opie's appearance on John Fugelsang's show (pre-taped due to Dick Cavett's presence) was discussed, focusing on a panel about the N-word and its usage, referencing John Lennon and Yoko Ono's appearance on Cavett's show and the controversy surrounding Lennon's song "Woman is the Nigger of the World."  Clips from Cavett's interviews with John and Yoko Ono, and Marlon Brando, were played and discussed, highlighting their awkwardness.  Yoko Ono's artistic merit was criticized with offensive language, alongside clips of her performances and a Rock and Roll Circus appearance.  The conversation also touched upon a new car theft method ("sliding"), vandalism of the Jackie Robinson statue, and Opie's recent root canal experience.

The next segment opened with a discussion on the surprising trend of women (particularly in the Hispanic community) shaving and tattooing their eyebrows.  After initial dead phone lines, Mars called in, confirming the trend but distancing himself from those involved.  The discussion veered into the even more extreme practice of eyeball tattoos, followed by detailed descriptions of various body modifications, including Prince Albert and split penis piercings. Rich Voss then called in, initially offering unsolicited dental advice, before discussing his veneers, personal dental history, and marital issues.  Accutane and its effects were also discussed.  A recent roast Opie attended was mentioned, followed by another call from Rich Voss about work and the PGA championship.  A photo of Opie with new veneers was shown and discussed.

The hosts then reviewed "Olympus Has Fallen," praising the action and Gerard Butler's performance, while noting the negative critical reception and making potentially offensive remarks about the movie's portrayal of Koreans.  The film’s depiction of the Presidential line of succession led to a discussion of Alexander Haig's infamous press conference after the Reagan assassination attempt, including a clip of the broadcast and Opie's personal anecdote.  Opie shared an embarrassing early comedy story, before Josh Gad's arrival.  Gad discussed his career, including his role as Sam Kinison, work on the "Steve Jobs" movie, and upcoming projects, with further discussion on Sam Kinison and Gad’s upcoming film about sex addiction. The Elvis channel and its programming were briefly mentioned.

A later segment featured Josh Gad promoting a movie, discussing his work, Harrison Ford's line delivery in *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom*, and Sam Kinison impressions (with Craig Gass being mentioned).  Dennis Falcone, a SiriusXM employee, appeared in-studio, discussing recently released Elvis Presley recordings and a bad audio production anecdote ("Don't Make the Panda Angry").  The conversation included David Lee Roth (and a story about Opie and Anthony's early careers), the upcoming "Gathering of the Gigolos" (frequently misheard as "Juggalos"), and the departure of intern Jackie.  Sam Roberts reflected on his career, future plans, and Juggalo appearance, discussing the challenges of authenticity on radio, referencing a SiriusXM memo on broadcasting advice.  The segment concluded with a song dedicated to Jackie.

A final excerpt focused on Sam Roberts' career trajectory, debating whether he was "failing upwards" and the need for more risks.  Sam discussed unusual food hang-ups, reluctance to seek professional help, YouTube videos, relationship with the fanbase, and a possible collaboration with David Lee Roth.  Callers suggested an "efficiency expert" and encouraged him to work on his voice.  The segment also included advertisements for Steven Singer Jewelers and mentions of the Gathering of the Juggalos (though Sam wouldn't attend).  Jackie's departure, potential farewell celebration, and the possibility of Sam bringing his mother to the show (referencing previous intern-related antics) were discussed, all peppered with profanity and frank discussions of personal issues.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Here are the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  I can't believe it.  All right, so vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second. 
[00:04:00]  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, it ain't every day.  That's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:04:30]  Rules are destroyed, and conventions burn to the grove.  Would you like to make some fuck pizza again?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  He doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Tie these people.  Up my ass all the time, trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off it. 
[00:05:00]  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, good morning, everybody.  Hi, peoples.  Whoever you are, wherever you are.  Out there.  Well, I put a picture up of who I think our listeners should be. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, you did?  Nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Going old school, are you?  It's like Dave Douglas told us to do.  Well, he's a blue-collar guy.  Tell us about your listeners, guys.  At this point, he's a grandfather.  Yeah.  Yeah, that blue-collar guy we described years ago is retired now.  Yeah, he's retired.  He's got a pension.  Oh, God.  He's got a really bad back.  Yeah.  Oh, my word.  I don't even know if that meant anything to the people. 
[00:06:00]  Nah, no.  Old school radio program directors.  What the hell is wrong with the mic today, man?  Yeah, there is something amiss, right?  It's a little low or something?  I don't know.  Oh, I can start guessing.  Let's see.  Oh, guessing.  Where's the master switch?  Massive.  Anyway, program directors, you know, they wanted their DJs to picture who they're talking to.  Yeah.  You're not just talking to a mic. 
[00:06:30]  You're talking to friends.  Right.  And we knew we were talking to teenagers, teenage girls, teenage boys.  Kind of think Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  But our PD at the time wanted us to think that we were talking to a, you know, a middle-class man.  Professionals.  With a blue-collar job.  It just wasn't true.  We would go to the phones and hear these high-pitched voices requesting fucking Nirvana.  And Green Day.  Could you play Geek Stink Breath? 
[00:07:00]  Geek Stink Breath.  I don't know what that was.  Sounded like it could have been a grunge song.  Yeah, exactly.  It was.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, who was it?  Who did it?  Green Day did it.  Green Day.  That was Green Day.  That was Green Day.  Yeah.  And it was really called Geek Stink.  It did stick in my head.  Wow.  Geek Stink Breath?  Geek Stink Breath.  Give me a little taste of that, E-Rock.  Oh, this.  Okay.  Enough.  That song.  Oh, okay.  They all sounded like Beavis and Butthead when they called us. 
[00:07:30]  They really did.  Anthony Weiner.  Fuck.  This guy is awesome.  Now he has to explain why he called that guy Grandpa.  This is the world we live in.  And I don't believe the explanation.  Every day there's a list of shit going on out there that we got to call out.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck he called his opponent Grandpa?  It's kind of funny.  And he was able to flip it and say, look, the guy mentions his granddaughter all the time  when it comes to these issues facing New York City. 
[00:08:00]  And does he?  I don't know.  I hope so.  Because that's a psychotic thing just to make up.  I know.  I don't know.  Like he isn't psychotic anyway.  And what's what now?  Now that's a problem?  Calling an older person Grandpa?  Yes.  The guy's 68, 69.  Most likely, when you get to that age, you're a Grandpa.  It's age discrimination.  It's ageism.  What do you mean?  Ageism.  What is ageism?  You can't ageism.  You can't make fun or bring up the fact that somebody could be a grandfather or elderly. 
[00:08:30]  Why?  Oh, I don't know.  That's just a fact of life.  That's what it is now.  If you get that old, you're going to most likely have grandkids.  No.  Old people are in a category now, like blacks and Asians and gays.  So if you have a grandchild, that means that you're a lesser of a person?  I don't know.  Why can't you call a grandfather Grandpa?  And why can't that person still do all right with himself and his life? 
[00:09:00]  If you watch TV commercials, you'll see that elderly, they're out there.  They're doing things.  They're fucking burdens is what they are.  Did you see that one commercial with the woman?  She goes, I'm in my 60s.  I got a long life ahead.  Big plans.  What big plans?  You're in your 60s.  Look, okay.  You know, it's not like it was years and years ago, but better get those plans a bit of snap  too.  Human beings are just stupid.  Yes.  You should not have to work until you hit 50. 
[00:09:30]  And then like the shitty years.  All right.  Then you go fucking nine to five.  Oh, that would be a good idea.  All these people that retire and they got bad.  They can't do half the shit they want in their golden years.  They're all lonely.  They would be at work with other people.  Of course they would.  They would be socializing.  They got to go to the doctor to just fucking have a conversation.  You work your ass off to maybe get to what?  65 ish.  67 ish.  Yeah.  68.  And then you got all these great plans for your golden years. 
[00:10:00]  Your retirement.  That never works out for people.  These are the best years of my life.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  Every day, another part of your body's dying.  It's rotting off or busting.  I can't find anything because you got pill bottles all over the fucking place.  How is that the best years of your life?  When you're younger and you hurt your elbow or your knee or something like that, it's like, oh, in another few days or a week, it'll be back to normal.  Right. 
[00:10:30]  When you get older, if your elbow hurts, that's going to hurt now until you die.  Yeah, of course.  It just never heals.  It's pretty much it.  That's it.  But you're going to take up what?  Boating?  Are you really?  That's so stupid.  Grandpa.  I really think the whole fucking world is stupid.  It's so stupid how we think of everything.  It's just ridiculous.  So now Anthony Weiner has to explain calling the guy Grandpa.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Like, that's a bad thing.  He talks about his granddaughter.  Right.  Yeah, that's it.  I know what he was getting at.  You're too old to be mayor.  I get it.  Right.  But he should be able to say that without explaining it.  But I know he said it in front of him like, what, a whole bunch of old people?  AARP.  It was an AARP event.  So let them decide if that's insulting or not.  I think they deemed it insulting.  Really?  He has to admit he was insulting him.  He's trying to find a way where he was saying it affectionately instead of just being honest  and going, hey, that guy pissed me off and he was being a jerk. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Right.  So I insulted him.  Yeah.  I gave him a little what of it.  Yeah, Grandpa.  Everybody knows what he's saying.  Hey, Grandpa.  Yeah.  You never say that in a good way.  No, no.  Unless it's your own grandfather.  There's only one person you can say that nicely to.  Shut up, Ken.  Shut up, Grandpa.  Yeah.  There's a story worse than Wiener as far as language and PC shit.  You hear about the Asian names?  There's an update on the Asian names.  Oh, the one that.  The big crash out there in San Francisco.  Crash landing, we should call it. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  And remember they went on the news with the names of the pilots.  Remember that whole story?  We Too Low.  You got the clip there, Sam Roberts, who's dressed way too nice today.  What the fuck is that about?  Oh, no.  What do you got going on?  Thank you very much.  You got a little interview today?  A little interview?  Sometimes you just make positive life changes.  Oof.  So cut your hair then.  Cut your throat.  I like my hair.  That was the line.  In any order you like it. 
[00:12:30]  We don't like it.  I came in, Sam, in his fucking, like, it's like a long-sleeved button-down shirt.  Yes.  And it's tucked into, like, chinos.  Tucked in.  His sleeves are rolled up very nicely.  Thank you.  But there's not a wrinkle on your shirt.  That is weird.  I appreciate the compliment.  Compliment.  I've never worn a shirt that hasn't had a wrinkle or two on it.  Yeah.  Well, sometimes you got to look good to feel good.  You know what I mean?  Well, you don't.  No.  You look stupid.  You know, when I came in with my shirt tucked in one time, you guys were all over me. 
[00:13:00]  That's true.  Why is it tucked in?  Is that the new style?  It looks good.  No one tucks their shirts in.  This shirt, if tucked out, the tails are a bit long.  Oh.  So you tuck it in.  Oh.  I don't know.  I don't know if people are tucking their shirts.  They will be.  He gave me so much abuse when I tucked my shirt in one time.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Him and Danny, I walked in and I just caught them both, like, looking at me.  Yeah.  I'm like, what?  He's tucking.  He's tucking.  Well.  Do you blouse it out a little bit at the bottom?  No.  No?  It's just a straight tuck.  It's a tight tuck.  It's a tight tuck.  I mean, blousing is not in style. 
[00:13:30]  Hey.  You got to blouse a little bit.  I know.  You don't blouse.  You have to.  Don't tell me what's in style.  You're fucking totally ripping off my look from 1977.  Especially if you have birthing hips.  He does.  You got to blouse out a little bit.  He does.  You got to blouse out a little bit.  I saw this story.  Remember, we got an update on this, but here's the original clip.  Coroner is still trying to determine the cause of death and whether she was already dead when the truck hit her. 
[00:14:00]  Thanks.  We have new information now also on the plane crash.  KTVU has just learned the names of the four pilots who were on board the flight.  They are Captain Sum Ting Wong, Wee Tu Lo, Ho Li Fook, and Bang Ding Au.  The NPSB has confirmed these are the names of the pilots on board flight 214 when it crashed.  Hilarious.  We are working to determine exactly what roles each of them play.  How are they this stupid? 
[00:14:30]  I don't think that prank will ever be bang ding au.  Bang ding au is my favorite.  You know what's great?  You just know they ran out of other names like that.  They came up with three winners as far as the actual thing.  And it's like, just bang ding au.  And I was listening to 1010 Winds on the way in.  Yeah.  From the beach house.  And they bleeped Holy Fook.  Did they?  Yeah.  It's a news story.  And you're not actually saying fuck.  You're not saying fuck.  It's Fook. 
[00:15:00]  Holy Fook.  But they bleeped it.  I'm like, what the hell are you doing?  Someone making a decision there.  Here's the update.  A lot of people were fired.  Did you read the story?  Wow.  Did you read this?  I'm so irritated.  It's just.  I'm reading it as you're talking about it.  That's why we're bringing it up.  I cannot believe this.  But this is the world we live in.  So we should believe it.  At least four KTVU staffers saw prank pilot names before cringeworthy broadcast.  Okay.  Yeah.  The fake Asiana airline pilot names that outraged, amused, and baffled. 
[00:15:30]  Those were fake?  Bay Area TV viewers were emailed to an ace reporter source to say,  an ex-pilot with a trustworthy reputation who previously worked with Fox affiliate KTVU,  sent the names to award-winning journalist Roland D. Walk.  Reported local blogger Rich Lieberman.  All right.  So you got this ex-pilot.  He did some work for the station.  He was the one who said, hey, I got the names for you if you want them.  So they're going to go with this guy.  Obviously, he was a bit disgruntled. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, man.  Or maybe.  No, he wasn't tricked, was he?  I don't know.  Well, because he did say, you better check these names out.  Oh, okay.  So he was maybe tricked.  Maybe he was suspicious.  So then D. Walk, in turn, passed the names along to newsroom staffers at the San Francisco Bay Station.  You better check these names out, D. Walk said.  At least four people reportedly read the prank names, which we just played here.  Before anchor, Torrey Campbell read them during a new newscast July 12th.  So a bunch of people read the names before it went on the air.  Oh, wow. 
[00:16:30]  So there were still a lot of safeguards here.  How'd he get through the four people?  And then the dumbest of them all, Torrey Campbell, read them on the fucking air.  Yeah.  Managing editor Michelle Toy, who read the names aloud, thought the names sounded suspicious.  Oh, did you?  But approved the list regardless.  She was told that an official at the National Transportation Safety Board confirmed their authenticity.  That official was a summer intern who acted outside the scope of his authority.  Oh.  Uh, KTVU, KTVU fired four staffers for the blunder, but spared Toy. 
[00:17:00]  Uh.  Know why they spared Toy?  Why?  Asian.  Asian.  They spared the Asian.  And they didn't want to offend the Asian community.  They didn't want to offend the Asian community anymore, so they did not fire her.  Do you understand what's going on here?  That is so against what it's supposed to be.  She fucked up like everybody else, but because she's Asian, they did not fire her.  Didn't fire her face.  This is the world we live in.  Completely on her racial background.  Afraid of back, they were afraid of the backlash. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  Lieberman source, uh, Lieberman source speaking on the condition of anonymity allegedly said  that Toy kept her job because of her Asian heritage.  Wow.  Uh, KTVU didn't want to offend the Asian community.  They already did so with the fake name scandal, and they were worried about a backlash.  Wow.  So she got, she got to keep her job over that.  Amazing.  Just because she's Asian.  Although they posted an ad Friday on their website for a managing editor.  Oh, there's a gag order on the staff.  Of course there is.  It's, this is not an investigated incident. 
[00:18:00]  You got pranked.  Yeah.  One guy should maybe be fired.  It happens.  Everyone's got, with the Mike, Mike Hunt, alcoholic.  That's what happened.  Alcohol.  I'm sorry.  We don't know Asian names.  And a lot of them sound odd to us.  That's how people looked at that and just read it.  And you're taught to not be offensive.  So you don't want to go, hey, this seems weird.  Because then you'll get fired for that.  Could you imagine that?  Yeah.  You go up and go, this name seems a little odd.  Oh, really?  You think Asian names seem odd?  If you question the Asian name and it's a real name, you're a racist and you're culturally 
[00:18:30]  biased and you don't appreciate the Asian people.  So you're fucking fired for either way?  Yeah.  Really?  We live in a shit world.  And you can't win.  It's unbelievable.  But I think she was the last safeguard, too, though.  Managing editor Michelle Toy, who read the names aloud, thought the name sounds suspicious,  but approved.  She approved the list regardless.  And she did not get fired because she's Asian.  Exactly.  That's unbelievable. 
[00:19:00]  And I don't even think most of them should have been fired.  It was a dumb mistake and it happened.  They all thought it was coming from a good source.  It was an error.  Right.  Right.  So, yeah.  Nobody was thinking that this was a prank.  They just put the other side of it.  If you're going to fire people.  I mean, she was the last safeguard.  She approved the names.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So I think the other people have a lawsuit.  Like, what the fuck?  Why are we getting fired?  And she was the one in the end that had to approve the names and she approved the names  and she keeps her job.  I think they could sue based on a racial firing. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  Like, if she was kept because of her race.  Right.  They were fired because of their race.  Right.  Because they weren't Asian.  Right.  They were fired.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That was, I heard that on the way in.  I could not believe it.  But at least it's out, though.  At least people know about it.  Right.  That's right.  Yeah.  Because someone at that station is really pissed off that she didn't get fired.  And, you know, other people did.  Char.  So they snuck that info out there to the blogger, I guess. 
[00:20:00]  We're lucky to have the, like, there's a gag order they can't talk about.  You imagine being stuck in that fucking environment where you got to live with that shit and you  can't say anything because they'll fire you for questioning it.  Like, oh, my.  At least we could yap about it.  And that leads to the miracle that happened here at Sirius XM yesterday.  A miracle.  When you walk in, people say that.  Stop it.  I actually call it a miracle.  Yeah.  We were able to save Troy Kwan's job.  Yes.  I did not believe it was possible.  I didn't either.  I thought fight, fight, so fight. 
[00:20:30]  But we fucking rolled up our sleeves and we got into this one.  Like Sam?  Because it was worth trying.  Tucked in our shirts.  Tucked in our shirts.  Tucked in our sleeves.  Pointed our feet out in the wrong direction and marched right in.  With awful voices.  Exactly.  We backed right in.  I tweeted yesterday, I thanked Sirius XM for doing the right thing because I really do  believe in the end it was the right thing. 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  And I'm amazed we were able to get this done.  Absolutely.  I really am amazed.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  It's a breath of fresh air because like the story we just read, this shit is going on all  over the fucking place.  Rampant.  And we were able to make a difference yesterday.  Yeah.  It's a big fucking deal for this radio show.  Very cool.  And in a way for this company that they're willing to listen a little bit instead of doing what  everyone else does and just fucking fire people.  Right.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be funny?  He shows up first day and just punches Zito in the face. 
[00:21:30]  And then hits all of us because he had a new gig lined up.  A lot of people were speculating.  Zito was completely fine with what happened on the air after it happened.  They talked and everything was cool.  Everybody was.  This went a lot deeper than Zito for whatever reason.  It's still shady, you know, what was going on behind the scenes.  We don't know all the facts.  Yeah.  But in the end, Zito was completely fine.  Yeah.  He wasn't happy about it.  But then they talked and Zito was totally cool about it. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  So I got to give him credit on this whole thing.  Yeah.  I saw him yesterday.  He was very cool though.  And he fucking, you know, he retweeted my tweet saying, you know, he was happy that  that was the decision SiriusXM made.  Yeah.  And I've also been, you know, told that a few people are not happy with the decision  and that we shouldn't, we shouldn't be celebrating today and grandstanding on our show.  Yeah.  That's what I was told.  But it does feel like you said, like, like, like they had made, they were, you know, it's  like the company is always this like faceless thing when you work somewhere, even here, 
[00:22:30]  it's like that.  Yeah.  And you feel like we wanted something.  We had meetings and we talked about it and then they actually reconsidered and weighed  things out.  And it's like, you very rarely feel that way when you work at a giant corporation.  He was very fired last Thursday.  I think so.  They were just figuring out, you know, they were just what, dotting the I's and crossing  the T's, that, that crap.  That's what they do.  But he was very fired.  And then slowly but surely we broke, you know, we broke him down with some knowledge.  I think.  It's just ridiculous.  I think we educated some people around here today. 
[00:23:00]  That a company is like that.  Like Jimmy said, it's just once they make up their mind, it's very digital.  Right.  There's no fucking gray area.  It's on or off.  And, and, and when we presented what we felt the deal was and how important he is to the  show, I think they, yeah, it's a hard work kind of went, all right, you fucking assholes.  All right.  He's a hard worker.  He's a smart, smart guy.  Yeah.  Does way more than he has to with his job title. 
[00:23:30]  And he gets the bitches.  Then he gets the bitches.  Forget about the bitches.  Yeah, the part of me was kind of hoping to see him go and we could hire a really ugly  guy there so I could once again be the most handsome guy in this room.  Y-Rock, you happy that Troy's here?  Very much so.  All right.  Because we never heard from you through the whole thing.  Exactly.  It is true.  You kept very quiet about this.  You really manned up and started working on your production skills, helping to rope in  a little extra fucking coin for yourself, didn't you, Greedy? 
[00:24:00]  I was eyeing his office.  It's a comfortable temperature in here, too.  It's good.  God.  Jesus.  It was freezing.  It's like 111 right now.  It was freezing when I walked in.  Oh, was it?  Oh, my God.  You have to point at me.  I was freezing when I walked in this morning.  It probably was freezing here.  But the stupid thermometer, you turn it up a smidge and all of a sudden it's 180 in here.  Yeah.  It goes from 65 to 180.  There's no way to really control that thing.  It is the worst thermostat ever.  It's a big, huge slider.  It's just a big sliding thing. 
[00:24:30]  Huge slider.  There's no real numbers on it.  You have to guess.  I think I'm going up to 72.  No, it's 128.  Yeah, you're guessing.  Shouldn't that be a digital readout where you go, ding, ding, ding, ding, and you fucking  put out the temperature you want.  Well, when they remodel the studio for us, I'm sure we'll get that.  Oh, that's, yeah.  Remember that?  Remember that meeting?  Yeah, I don't know why you keep talking about it like it's going to happen.  And Sam had to remind me, remember, nothing's going to happen.  Because I did get excited.  What?  Keyboard's back.  Oh, the keyboard's back up there.  It's great.  I bet you the keyboard does it on its own. 
[00:25:00]  Yes, it just crawls back out.  So when a dog runs away and comes back three years later, we actually threw that in the  dumpster outside.  It's like the doll from The Conjuring just shows back up.  We had a meeting.  It had to be months ago at this point.  All the big engineer guys were standing around.  Oh, yes.  We explained everything we wanted.  Look, your screen is back.  I know.  And they just pushed the other one down.  All they did was push that one down.  I could do that every morning.  Just push it down.  And I got excited. 
[00:25:30]  Then Sam pulls me aside.  Remember.  He goes, remember, nothing's going to happen.  I'm like, damn it.  You're right.  I almost was tricked.  Yeah.  I was almost tricked this time.  They're good.  We had a little hope.  And then you look at the sign.  You think you were to learn from the wall.  I know.  But then they had excuses like they're busy with this and that.  And I don't know if someone's graduating or fucking birthday party.  There was some weird shit.  So they're like, they'll get to you.  It's going to cost $900,000. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  But then you just walk down the hall and they're remodeling Howard's entire area.  Yeah.  He doesn't even do radio shows anymore.  And they're remodeling his entire area.  Which they just remodeled like a couple years ago.  I know.  But they'll tell us, oh, that's different.  That's what we always hear.  Oh, that's just different.  I don't know.  We don't even know what happens on that side of the building.  It's like a whole other company over there.  We don't know.  We don't do.  We don't say.  There's a major remodeling going on.  And I know we asked way before that shit went down. 
[00:26:30]  Is he paying for that or are they?  I heard he was an efficiency expert.  He was an efficiency expert?  What the hell is that about?  That's like our Sam Roberts.  What is an efficiency expert?  You're kidding, right?  Oh, no.  What's an efficiency expert?  Sam, what do you know about this?  Sam, you're the guy with the scuttlebutt around here.  Well, because he hangs around, so he gets...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's the man with the info.  He's got his ear to the fucking street.  He's got a lot of friends.  Yeah?  You're a water cooler type of guy.  Oh, yeah.  Love that water cooler. 
[00:27:00]  So, what's going on today around?  Just standing around with your glass of water with your tight pants.  Yeah, your corporate slacks.  Your tucked in shirt.  Sue, what the hell's going on around here?  Rocking back and forth on his heels.  Hey, so, what's going on over here?  Hoping someone notices the bolts in the front of his tight pants, and not the one in the  back.  He shit himself.  What's an efficiency expert?  Well, from what I hear, there is an employee over there that is an efficiency expert, and 
[00:27:30]  what they do is they go in, and they look at the organization, and they figure out how  things can be done better to make sure that the right amount of input is happening.  It's not a radio efficiency expert.  Oh, the king is panicking.  The king is panicking.  Hire me to be the efficiency expert for over there, and I'll tell you exactly what needs  to be done.  What's step one?  He has to do radio shows. 
[00:28:00]  That would be efficient.  He could blame everyone around him.  He could blame his staff.  He could, like, fire people.  He could bring in an efficiency expert.  But in the end, the guy's got to do radio shows.  Because I've heard from his audience.  They're sick of the fucking reruns at this point.  It is doing awesome.  Great reruns, but it doesn't matter anymore.  They don't care.  They don't want to hear the same stuff just repackaged over and over again.  Hire me to be your efficiency expert.  You've got to fucking do radio shows, period.  Isn't it amazing how many tweets and messages and stuff you're getting? 
[00:28:30]  Right.  I'm getting a lot of them that say-  A ton.  I just can't take the replays anymore.  I'm listening to your guy's show.  I've been listening for, like, a week.  It's really cool.  Like, oh, thanks.  Because then they take the same bits, and then they put a package around, and they think  that their hardcore listeners aren't going to notice.  The guy has to do radio shows.  I could have saved him hundreds of thousands of dollars on the-  Bam.  Is it abroad?  It is a lady.  Ooh.  A lady is going to tell Howard what his organization needs. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God.  He's panicking.  I love it.  It's hilarious.  Revamp the studios, please.  He needs to do radio shows, and it doesn't matter where he does it from.  He's got the big fucking place in the Hamptons.  Fucking turn on a fucking mic and do an hour here and there.  You can do that, right?  Right?  Sure.  But he's going to continue blaming people and bringing in an efficiency expert when everyone  knows what needs to be done.  He needs more content.  The efficiency expert is there to capitalize on what they have. 
[00:29:30]  Why is he doing the glasses thing?  Wait a minute.  If you go to his-  That's his website?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The whole front of it is the-  It's America's Got Talent.  Yeah.  Because that's the big important thing now?  Yeah, he doesn't give a fuck about his radio show.  Technically-  Everyone knows that.  Everyone knows he doesn't give a fuck about his radio show.  Wow.  He gets paid very well to do it, but he wants to be a TV star. 
[00:30:00]  That's great.  There are significantly more episodes of America's Got Talent over the summer than there are episodes  of The Stern Show.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  Significantly more.  I mean, there's maybe six radio shows this summer.  E-Rock's pulling a mic to his mouth.  What do you got on this?  I wish there was a trigger on it.  What do you got on this, E-Rock?  No, I was just moving it out of the way.  Were you bringing a hoagie up quickly and you were afraid of a collision?  How about you do that with your plate? 
[00:30:30]  He needs a food traffic controller by his mouth.  Yeah, we got a hoagie coming in on the right side.  Incoming hoagie.  Will you please hold?  Wait for the...  We're going to hire an efficiency expert for E-Rock.  Lasagna, stand by on 260.  A hoagie coming in.  Yeah.  Steak cocktail.  Pull back.  Pull back.  Steak cocktail.  Meatball taxi to the chin and wait for further instructions.  None of this is insulting. 
[00:31:00]  None of this.  A food traffic controller.  That mic is just like a giant blockade.  Yeah, just turn on a microphone somewhere and do an hour or two here and there.  Holy fuck.  You can still hang out in the Hamptons and have all your days off.  Jesus.  She's not the efficiency expert of the Howard Stern show.  We got this info from Denny, as a matter of fact.  She's the COO.  What's the COO?  What?  She's the chief operating officer. 
[00:31:30]  Chief operating officer is also...  She's the same person.  Of what?  The Howard Stern universe.  What?  Empire?  Yeah.  Marcy is our newest addition to the Stern Show team.  She has come on board to head up all operations for the show and all aspects of the Stern brand.  Howard brought her on board so as we keep growing, both as a show and a business, we can continue to produce the best radio show in the history of broadcasting.  She comes to us with a well-rounded skill set. 
[00:32:00]  Eww.  A well-rounded skill set.  We joke about skill set.  I think she wrote that.  She probably...  I imagine, yeah.  An experience in management consulting, business expansion, finance coaching.  Coaching?  Finance coaching.  Probably had to make your money.  No, it's not finance coaching.  It's finance, comma, coaching.  Exactly.  You know, comma reading, fucking tucked in shirt, motherfucker.  I hate the way Sam ignores commas and I hate it.  Could you imagine what this would be like in the early 90s, how he would have joked about this if he found out a radio show hired someone like this? 
[00:32:30]  You think she has the balls to tell Howard he needs to do more radio shows?  The king's new clothes.  But to look at everything else, but not the obvious.  The king's new clothes.  His audience wants new content, more new content.  Could you blow that picture up?  On creating the...  I'm not going to say anything bad because...  You can't.  You're not allowed to.  You're getting in trouble here.  But she looks like an attractive girl.  I think she's cute.  Yeah.  I realize something. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know if you're allowed to say that.  I don't either.  I'm very petrified at what I'm saying right now.  I don't know if you're allowed to say that.  I'm going to be very nice.  So I guess she's new and not a history of radio broadcasting.  She's something else.  But chief operating officer sounds like it would be a higher title than executive producer.  COO is a giant title.  Yes.  Well, of her own company, not his.  Right?  No.  She's the chief operating officer of the Stern Empire.  Howard Stern.  And it says, with Marcy's help, Howard is more focused than ever on creating top programming for both his old and new fans alike. 
[00:33:30]  Wow.  He's not motivated.  Top programming.  How do you have top programming when you have no program?  Right.  Yeah.  They took all his shows off his channels.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Apparently.  Well, because they're blaming everybody else instead of someone being brave enough and saying,  Howard, you're not doing enough radio for your fans.  But do you think after 30 years or however long he's been there, they brought in somebody to be Gary's Baba Booey's boss?  Oh. 
[00:34:00]  That's what I just thought of.  Oh.  Wow.  That is a little odd.  It would suck for him.  Because I'm sure he's blaming Gary and everybody else because, you know, the buzz isn't like it used to be.  And he could get the buzz back by just doing more radio, period.  That's your solution.  It's probably the other stuff around like that.  I don't think anybody's telling Gary how to do his job.  I mean, again, the guy knows how to get guests.  Well, they're also softening Howard in general.  Yeah, a little softer edge.  They're getting rid of a lot of the edgy stuff. 
[00:34:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I heard tell that part of the-  He's more of a family guy now.  What?  I heard part of the reconstruction over there is doing away with any kind of offensive pictures and writing and things like that that might be in the area.  Yep.  To just soften it down and make it more America's Got Talent than the old Howard Stern show.  What was the fact-  The studio videos I've seen, I haven't been in there, but it didn't seem anything was-  It just seemed like a TV studio.  No, I think it's just the-  It's the back office. 
[00:35:00]  The office area.  Like what people have to deal with.  They're softening everything over there.  Yeah, yeah.  Didn't they used to have like a mannequin with a ball gag and lingerie gear or something on the E! show?  No, that was Roland.  Oh.  He's sitting over there.  He's all in with the America's Got Talent.  Yeah, that seems to be the-  And blown off the radio thing.  Which, you know-  Wow, that sucks.  It's weird.  It is weird.  It's weird.  You know, who am I to say what is good for him or isn't good for him?  I mean, that's fucking great. 
[00:35:30]  You're on a huge network TV show.  It's just, it's okay.  It's just, it's basically like the gone show, really.  But it seems like it would suck for the fans.  With a little more, with a little more class, maybe.  A little more shine.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's just a gong show.  You shined up the gong show.  That's all it is.  You're J.P. Morgan.  Right.  You really are.  Instead of hitting that gong, you hit the stupid X.  Damn.  The buzzer.  It seems like it would just suck for the fans, though.  You'd think.  Right.  Like the radio show, and then all of a sudden- 
[00:36:00]  No, he just needs to do more shows, period.  Man, he could hire all the people he wants, but his fans need more content.  But you get new fans, too.  You get newer fans that know him from America's Got Talent and come over to the Stern show  because it's like, oh, he's got a radio show?  I like him on that show.  So they're new fans that don't even know about the old days.  And, you know, they could listen to a little Hollywood scuttlebutt thing, you know, during  his show and be like, oh, this is a good radio show.  Are they getting rid of the Sibian or whatever the fuck it's called? 
[00:36:30]  That fucking big dildo machine that girls would ride?  I don't think that's-  It doesn't seem very AGT.  Did his efficiency expert have to ride that before getting the job?  Was that part of the job interview?  Oh, God.  Holy fuck, he's losing his mind over there.  Yeah.  I thought money just brought you happiness in the end.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I thought money just solves everything.  I don't know if you're not efficient.  Now we've got to cut the- 
[00:37:00]  Let's put her picture up again.  I'm not going to say anything bad.  I just want to see something because, yeah, if you're going to take a photo for a website,  you should touch up the roots a little.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  That's the look, man.  That's all.  Is it?  Yeah, they let the roots grow in a little bit.  The darker roots are-  Yeah.  I think she looks better in the picture blown up than she did with it smaller.  Like, usually when you blow up someone's photo, it's more horrible.  She's actually very sexy.  That's the three stages of Twitter photos.  When you look at somebody on Twitter, and you just see the tiny little icon next to their tweet, 
[00:37:30]  and you're like, and then you press on, you hit on their Twitter page,  and you see their little picture gets a little bigger.  Right.  And they click on the picture, and it gets full, and you can be like,  oh, that girl looks, oh, oh, boy.  Do you ever get tricked and think the avatar is like a girl or something,  and then it turns out to be-  A man, yes.  No, no, not even that.  Not even that.  Oh, man, yes.  Not even that.  You make it bigger, and all of a sudden, it's like, it's an actual, 
[00:38:00]  it's a picture of the Grand Canyon.  I thought it was a chick.  I thought it was a girl.  Have you ever been-  Yes.  What is that?  That's the complete exaggeration, but-  That's crazy.  I'm like, oh, my God, I thought this was something else.  She looks sexy, but it's the Capitol building.  Right.  That's a big tit.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  The Capitol.  That's how we're going to, like, interview her on the air and ask her if she's, like,  you know, a three-input woman and all that, or-  Oh, come on.  Or what?  That's-  That's a thing of the past.  You can't do that anymore?  No. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, I see.  This is a management consultant.  So everything he's ever told his fans has been complete bullshit, right?  People can change over time, Opie.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm talking to you in my shirts.  You change a little bit.  You grow a little bit, but-  Right.  The funny thing is, if you think back to the old days of Stern, I was a Stern aficionado  back in the day.  Mm-hmm.  Listened all the time, and if you listen back, he always, always, always wanted to  be this guy. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  He came off, like, anti-establishment, anti-Hollywood and everything, but every opportunity he got  to do something like that, he jumped on and wanted to be the TV guy, the guy that was  accepted by mainstream America and everything.  It just couldn't pull it off until, you know, now he is.  But he's doing a, who gives a fuck, TV show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And making it sound like it's the greatest and biggest thing ever.  I mean, good for him.  He's on NBC.  I'm not, and yeah, there's a little jealousy involved, of course, but-  Yeah.  But don't make believe it's some amazing fucking TV show. 
[00:39:30]  It's, you're a fucking judge on a gong show type show.  Iraq either wants to talk or he's waving off a stack of hotcakes.  I'm not sure.  Iraq?  Yes.  I would never do that.  Yes.  Howard always used to just shit on Carson and Leno.  Right.  You know, that's exactly what he wanted.  He wanted the Tonight Show.  Yes.  Yes.  And he would shit on it all the time, but you could tell he wanted that TV and mainstream  America acceptability.  And I guess what?  He just fired Tim Sabian, who was a soldier for him? 
[00:40:00]  What happened with Sabian?  Did he get fired?  Nobody really knows.  Oh, shit.  It's very shady.  They buried him out in Jersey, right?  He took a leave of absence for, I guess, for some family issues, but nothing's been confirmed.  Tim Sabian?  We'll see him no more.  Damn it.  We'll see him no more.  He's a good dude, man.  I told Sabian what was going to happen to him.  Did you?  Yeah.  I told him when Howard's done with him.  Did you have a crystal ball?  He's just going to throw him out the door.  Did you do it with a crystal ball in front of you?  Because he might have listened then.  Okay.  I back up everything you want. 
[00:40:30]  I'll read the fucking text I sent him.  Holy shit.  While he's looking for that, they replayed your segment a couple weeks ago when you were on.  That was great.  Again, giving another show great radio.  What are you going to do on the vacation?  Go to Florida and be a stunt boy for Bubba?  Anthony's the new turd.  Wait a minute.  Turd?  Turd?  I don't want to be turd.  Love turd.  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  There's no more turd.  He's hitting the gas.  He's going toward the wall.  Turd? 
[00:41:00]  Turd?  That guy really did risk his life doing that, though.  50?  Oh, is that an awful fake bit?  Why?  He ran into the wall.  Sure he did.  I don't like the tucked in shirt, no explanation.  Sam Roberts.  It's very hard to get over it.  He's got an interview or something.  Yeah, you didn't just change your image overnight.  That's stupid.  WWE call.  What do you got?  What's going on?  I bet you what happened.  He's in the hallway and Marcy went, oh, you don't tuck your shirt in?  The next day, here he is.  She's the COO.  Trying to be efficient.  Yeah, it's very efficient.  COO.  What the fuck? 
[00:41:30]  It's not overnight.  I stopped wearing sneakers, and then I stopped wearing jeans.  That's good for the radio.  What are you doing?  I'm not doing it to entertain the people.  What are you doing it for?  Myself.  Are you not?  Oh, boy.  Sam's having a crisis, too.  Yes.  Yes, he is.  You're going to be turning 30.  Yep.  That's exactly what I'm turning 30 in a month.  Yeah.  He's fucking having a crisis.  Yep, you're having a little crisis.  It's not a crisis.  I'm going to be 30.  I'm going to just change up some things.  You know what I did when I was cracking the old 3-0? 
[00:42:00]  Why?  Because I felt I needed to fucking get fly right.  Yes, I do.  I got fucking married.  Huge mistake.  I should have just tucked in my shirt.  I put it a lot cheaper.  You should have tucked in a noose.  I felt good that I went back to shitty jeans today because I had horrible sweats with my crotch was blown out.  Did a little laundry?  Did you?  I came to work yesterday with my crotch blown out and my fucking sweats that are pushing 10 years old.  Because I didn't have anything to wear. 
[00:42:30]  So I came in here in pajamas yesterday.  Little jammies?  Yes.  Yes, that's what I pretty much wear in pajamas yesterday.  That's what I wear to bed.  Yeah.  Shit.  We better never get an efficiency expert.  They're going to fucking frown up on our clothes.  Not me.  Yeah.  Not Sam, right?  And what kind of...  What are those?  Gray colored...  Yeah, they're like gray.  Are those chinos?  Yeah, they're chinos.  I hate chinos.  I've never worn chinos. 
[00:43:00]  Stephen King writes about them a lot.  Really?  He paints really weird, amazing pictures of people.  And he'll like, you know, someone with their tucked in chinos.  And you immediately know who that guy is.  I was never able to pull off chinos.  That's why I hate them.  Yeah, who needs to wear them all the time?  Oof.  Oh, wow.  Never pull them off.  Oof.  You're stuck in them.  There was an old commercial back in the 70s, I believe.  It was for a record album of 50s music. 
[00:43:30]  And the guy was like, he said something like, it's like wearing bicycle chains on your chinos.  Right.  And that's the first time I heard chinos and never fucking ever liked the word after that.  It's a terrible word.  It is a bad word.  It's a horrible word.  What is a chino?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  It's what the tag says, though.  Yeah.  It's not like khakis.  It's a fucking snack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chinos.  That's fucking clever. 
[00:44:00]  Iraq, what do you got on the radio side of things?  He knows, too.  He knows stuff.  Why is he?  I don't understand why he's not chiming in.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, but what could you add?  I'm adding what I can.  What could you add to it?  You know why he doesn't want to add too much?  Because he's hoping he gets hired by the efficiency expert.  He doesn't want to lose his dream job.  Apple pie, hold short of the mouth.  Look for traffic to your left.  Believe there's a BLT coming toward the mouth. 
[00:44:30]  Wait for further instruction.  I love the idea that someone needs to tell Iraq what's coming toward his mouth.  And his fucking hands and feet are shoveling independent of each other.  I don't think that bit has legs, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Not with you saying that, no.  That'll never work.  That's the bit.  That's the bit.  Don't give away my bits.  That's the bit.  The bit.  Don't be Sal. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, God.  That was really funny.  What?  What?  I'm not E-Rock.  I'm not E-Rock.  It doesn't make any sense if it's me.  He didn't take it well.  But when I was driving home yesterday, I'm like, I know the audience doesn't understand  exactly what happened with that whole thing, but it was just amazing to us.  It was hilarious.  That he just didn't understand a basic bit.  It doesn't matter that E-Rock wasn't sitting there, because people would assume E-Rock was  sitting there, which makes it really fucking funny when fucking Jimmy does Chip going to break  after we came back from break for only a minute. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And then has a ridiculous E-Rock insult.  It's been a bit we've been doing forever, and Sal didn't understand it.  There was hands up in the air like, well, there's no E-Rock.  Right.  Like, do you not know there's no cameras in here?  Nobody knows that.  Theater of the mind, Sal.  E-Rock wanted to be a team player yesterday.  He wrote me.  What?  Yep.  About what?  And did you accept his resignation?  He wanted to be the one that took out the DQ table yesterday.  He wrote me.  He goes, I got it.  Wow. 
[00:46:00]  He goes, I got to be honest with you.  I really wanted to do it, but with this fucking culture.  Meant it differently, though.  With his mouth wide open, sliding across the table.  Like Pac-Man.  Look.  Oh, I don't fucking look.  He's picking up krill.  I swear I brought this up to give E-Rock a little boost, a little confidence.  It just goes to this.  Look, E-Rock's on our team, and look where it goes.  And by the way, I'm going to knock this fucking phony E-Rock down.  Because he wrote you that, because he knew that. 
[00:46:30]  It's almost like saying.  But he used to do all that shit in the past, so I don't think it's phony.  I think he's scared of the culture that is around us, where at any moment he can be fired.  But that's literally like, that guy in that bar, I was going to kick his ass, but you know,  I don't want to get locked up.  He's saying it to you after, like, you know what, dude, I was about to do it, but then  I thought, like, I better not.  And there's no way to question it.  You're talking to Hawk.  You understand that?  That is Hawk.  His first nickname was Hawk.  Yeah, he just went there and looked at a bird.  He ran from around the corner on live TV, acting like he was a hawk. 
[00:47:00]  I forgot they used to call him.  Do we have that?  Is that clip online anywhere?  I don't know.  If you find it, please send it to Sam.  But yeah, I really wanted to do that.  I kept looking at the TV behind Jim there, and I was like, that would be really easy to  just run and dive right into that table while they were live.  But you can't do that right now.  I don't know.  I think he can do it.  Oh, we got it?  So funny.  All right, here's the setup.  It was on the Upper East Side.  It's on foundrymusic.com.  Yes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:47:30]  Wait, this was on the Foundry Music.  In his watermarks.  This was on the Foundry Music radio show, I guess.  Yes, we need a fucking efficiency expert.  Well, we needed it a long time ago.  So on the Upper East Side, you got the hawks.  They nest in these really nice buildings, and the fucking locals hate it.  Yeah.  Because they can't look out their window without seeing a nest with a baby hawk in it.  How cool would that be?  Yeah.  What's wrong with these fucking people?  Until you're trying to sleep, and the fucking thing's going, hawk noise, hawk noise, hawk noise.  Whatever they sound like.  So you get the bird watchers out there every year, because, you know, the new hawks are 
[00:48:00]  hatching on the top of these buildings, and then you got the locals that are, like, they  poison the nest in the middle of the night, and make believe they didn't do it.  Have they done that?  Oh, they've done everything.  Oh, yeah.  They don't want the fucking hawks in there, at the top of their building.  So they were doing their dumb story, and then E-Rock, you know, comes running out of  nowhere to do a little assault on the media.  Later this morning, the director of the Audubon Society, along with environmentalists and 
[00:48:30]  park officials, will be meeting with the directors of the co-op board here at 927 Fifth Avenue  to decide the fate of Pale Male and Lola.  Well, this is apparently making international headlines.  They were evicted from their longtime Fifth Avenue home.  Reporting from Fifth Avenue, I'm Ernabel Demillo.  Back to you.  All right, Ernabel, thanks.  And, you know, she kept her composure.  There was a hawk circling around her in the back, it looked like.  Hey, you know, we've all been in the field enough to do live reports.  Why is there always that one absolute idiot who has to jump up and down and wave the arms  behind? 
[00:49:00]  Why?  Because their mom is so proud of them when they do that, you know, and it's very hard  to do.  That's my son.  You know, like Jim Ryan would never do something like that.  Jim would never do that.  Jim Ryan, Jody Applegate.  He would never do that.  True professionals.  They are complete professionals.  So, anyhow, let's talk to that.  Well, how about that one guy who was always on the cell phone, and he's going, oh, you know,  can you see me now?  This guy ran out of the building as if he was watching this show, like, in the lobby.  He was right out there as soon as you introduced it.  You're not saying he's in the same building.  Where do you go, Brainiac?  Are you?  We need to figure it out.  He's watching the show, and he saw me stand behind Stacey Ann. 
[00:49:30]  See, you planted it.  He got that idea.  Yeah.  And whatever happened to that guy?  They're consummate professionals, like the time him and that other guy got in an on-air argument  yelling at each other.  Wait, that was assault on the media, number 31?  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  It was a visual.  Iraq was in the background waving his arms.  He was flapping his arms like a big, giant hawk.  None of those people work there anymore.  Dumb dodo bird.  That's what I was getting at.  They're all pissed off, and they don't even have jobs. 
[00:50:00]  They couldn't figure out how to keep their jobs.  I got you a satellite phone.  Oh, thank you.  For your juggalo appearance.  Thank you very much.  For your juggalo-ing today?  Yeah.  Well, we leave after the show, and tomorrow night's my set down in Caven Creek, Illinois,  and my ICP episode, Caven Rock.  Kenny.  Episode I heard last night, so hopefully people won't throw shit at me.  You need a clear view of the sky. 
[00:50:30]  Not even clear.  You know, it could be trees and stuff.  And then turn it on and wait for your signal.  Your satellite signal.  And then you just dial away.  That's pretty cool.  It's not like a cell phone where, you know, you just pull it out and start dialing.  You know, you got to look.  Yeah, pull up the little antenna.  See, like this.  Like this.  You pull up the antenna.  Oh, wow.  Like that.  And then this goes straight up.  Cannon!  And you go, hi, cannon!  I know, it's a giant antenna.  That's Michael Douglas and the Hamptons type phone.  Yeah, it says, wish you could see this sunrise, buddy. 
[00:51:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  But it's great if there's no cell signal, which I hear is what happens up there.  Well, you got to put your finger in a pig statue's ass.  The pig statue ass, apparently.  Did you see, speaking of the jugglers, did you see the picture of the Walmart?  No.  What is this?  You got to look at this.  This is the closest.  I'm quite fearful for you guys.  Well, I'm not going.  You're not going.  Uh-uh.  Because you were going to go with Troy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And apparently Troy is persona non grata with doing anything for a while. 
[00:51:30]  Well, they said he's too scary to be there.  Like the juggalos didn't want him.  What about Iraq?  Why didn't Iraq go?  Iraq, like, I guess, because it was still last minute.  He said he couldn't go.  He's got construction going on at the Nagel Mansion.  Whoa!  He's putting on a new wing.  The old doors.  What kind of construction?  Um, getting stuff done for a new fence and new security system.  Nice!  A security system?  His wife's having an alarm put on the fridge? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  State-of-the-art kind of video surveillance.  Getting some cameras.  Nice!  I like it.  Access on the phone.  Access on the phone so you can pop that up and go,  What's going on at my house?  Love it.  Wait, what is that?  It looks like a shrink wrap.  Yeah, Walmart shrink wrap, saran wrap, their entire makeup section.  And it's the closest Walmart to where the juggalos are.  The gathering of the juggalos. 
[00:52:30]  Because they would steal them?  Because juggalos kept going into Walmart and stealing makeup to paint their face.  Oh, my God.  And so they had to saran wrap their entire makeup section so nobody could get in.  How about they catch people stealing it?  Because they're juggalos.  They just keep doing it.  You can't catch a juggalo.  That's crazy.  They're ninjas.  They probably just were just about to hire some old person to stand there and be trounced  by some guy with Detroit tattooed on his chest.  Some fucking meth-out animal.  Fucking been unemployed for four years and he's just looking to bite somebody's teeth. 
[00:53:00]  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Where were we?  We need to be efficient here.  Yes.  Where's our efficiency expert?  Juggalos gather in Hardin County.  Nice.  Oh, man.  Jimmy, you're going to have fun, I think.  Yeah, I mean, we can win today.  We'll have a nice dinner tonight.  And then we're staying like 90 minutes from the... 
[00:53:30]  There's nowhere around there to stay.  No.  So you got a 90-minute drive from the hotel...  That's better than I thought.  I thought it was going to be three hours.  Into the middle...  This is in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be three hours.  But I'm there tomorrow night.  Charlie Murphy's there Saturday.  I think Dante Nero is around.  And I forget who else is there.  But I'm sure it'll be fine.  I'm actually not worried about it.  It is what it is.  Did we play a fuse thing?  That's a radio bit.  I haven't seen it yet.  So let me watch it first.  All right. 
[00:54:00]  See how it came off.  I did like your pictures last night of you and Dick Cavett.  Yeah.  Let me watch it before you play.  Wow.  The previous photo of you and Dick Cavett.  You both look so much better these days than you did in that previous picture.  Yes.  You were such a little tubby guy.  I really was.  And I did that John Fugelsang show, which Current TV was taken over by Al Jazeera.  It's becoming Al Jazeera America.  They're pulling his show, which is called Viewpoint.  And it's a good show to do.  I mean, they really want you to come on and talk about what you want to talk about. 
[00:54:30]  And they're ending.  So usually a tape's live.  But yesterday they did a pre-tape because Dick Cavett was on.  So me, him, and this comedian, Jim David, we're on.  And Dick Cavett's great, dude.  Yeah.  He's great.  Yeah.  We had him on once in a while.  He had a really good time with the guy.  What stories that guy's got.  What?  Well, I'll tell you what we're talking about.  We were talking about the word, the N-word.  And Dick was interviewed with John.  And then I come out.  It's just me and John.  And then we do a three-person panel for like four segments, two or three segments. 
[00:55:00]  And we talked about the word nigger and how I hate when they say this and that.  I hate the N-word.  I forget what it came about.  It was about fraudulence and outrage like I always yap about.  So Dick came out and was talking about John Lennon when he was on his show and the stir he caused.  But remember that song he did with Yoko called Woman is the Nigger of the World?  Yes.  And that was a big deal.  And Dick said they didn't want to air the episode.  Wow.  And he goes, I just got you John and Yoko.  You're going to air it. 
[00:55:30]  And he said the network, this is Dick Cavett way back then, made him do an announcement beforehand that some people might be offended.  This is not a new phenomenon.  This has been happening for a long time.  You like to think it's some kind of new thing, but no.  Not really.  Like overreacting even in context.  And he said they got 40 complaints.  He said all of them were about his mealy-mouthed announcement.  Oh, wow.  And he complained because Lennon explained what he was doing and why he said it and people knew the intent wasn't angry. 
[00:56:00]  I'm going to hear that now.  I would like to as well if you can get it from last night.  No, I want to hear the John Lennon.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Find him on Dick Cavett.  I want to hear the announcement that tried to calm everyone down before the episode aired.  Yeah.  Dude, he was fucking, he interviewed Brandon.  He had everyone.  Yeah.  Very well-respected.  Ali.  Guys like him.  I want to talk to Dick Cavett more about just his show. 
[00:56:30]  The Dick Cavett Show.  Everyone yelled back then, huh?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Starring Opie.  Tonight with special guests, John Lennon.  This is some of that jazz we were listening to yesterday.  Ladies and gentlemen, Dick Cavett, Robert Hopkins.  Right.  Wonderful.  Robert Hopkins, ladies and gentlemen.  This was showbiz. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  Now people just walk out.  All right.  So what the fuck are we talking about tonight?  You had to do something before you got to this point.  Now a reality star can just do this.  Can you do a monologue?  Could you pause real quick?  One thing I love that they do, like you can see that he's on a big stage floor and then  you can see where the actual, his desk and the chairs are on this, like, I'd say it's  raised about three inches off the floor, but you can see that right next to it.  It's like they don't make it look like, they just show you that, yeah, here's where it 
[00:57:30]  is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's really, it's kind of like, what's the word I'm looking for?  Bare bones?  There's something about it that's honest that I like.  Yeah.  Look how well-dressed he is.  Yeah, he looks good.  That is true.  That's right.  So now you decide to do the same thing, but you're a dickhead.  Listen, I, I am afraid I have a major disappointment to announce. 
[00:58:00]  The tie that I wanted to wear didn't show up for today's show, and I'm going to have  to go along with this one.  No, the actual disappointment is that the Lennons asked that I not do a monologue, because  it, no, they, see, they find me so funny that if I convulse them backstage, they won't  be able to come out here and talk.  So I'm not going to do that, but we really have a terrific show tonight.  Well, that's not true.  Everybody's, it's one of the hottest tickets in town. 
[00:58:30]  The censor has an oxygen tent standing by for some reason.  I don't know why, because first of all, he thought it was going to be an easy day.  He didn't know exactly what show we were doing tonight.  And he heard the word Beatle and thought it was a show on ecology and thought it was going  to have a lot of fun.  And now he knows who he is.  And our censor is an older man and an interesting man, but a very fair man.  And I have knocked him in the past just joking.  But we have an understanding now that from now on, nothing comes out of the show. 
[00:59:00]  And we think that that's a wonderful thing, because you're mature people, and I think  have a right, want to.  So.  Do a little skip thing.  Anyway, I realize that there's a tremendous request for autographs here tonight, but if  you will leave your books, I will get to all of them, eventually.  And is this a surprise for me?  I couldn't help, I can't help noticing that, maybe I shouldn't mention that right now, that 
[00:59:30]  in the second row are two people peculiarly attired.  I think I won't tamper with that at the moment.  What is he doing?  Pause that for one second.  Sorry.  He was always a little weird.  But look at how, but look at how.  He's a great interviewer, though.  Yeah.  How imperfect it is.  Like, Mike Douglas is the same way.  There's a sloppiness to it.  Yes.  It didn't have to be polished.  It didn't have to be douchey and perfect and polished.  Like that Beatles joke.  Maybe you would want to chop the fucking ecology joke. 
[01:00:00]  But it was like, you know, this is what TV was.  It wasn't everybody is an amazingly beautiful person and every single beat is absolutely  perfect.  Right.  It wasn't this fucking sanitized garbage.  Yeah.  There was an honesty about it.  About when he was doing Tough Crowd.  He was, what do you want, a fucking polished game show host?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like there's imperfect, imperfection is nice.  When Carson would bomb, it was fun.  Right.  And it also leads you to believe that whoever is talking, doing the interview with them, 
[01:00:30]  that they're going to be a little more honest because they're able to go out there like  that, show their foibles and not be perfect.  So you'd think they'd be a little more honest when they're speaking also because they don't  need it to be perfectly polished.  Guys like him, and we've said this before, Mike Douglas would allow.  Slow moments.  They would allow a moment of uncomfortability or like a little bit of fumbling on the air.  Yep.  Because that was how you are.  You are when you interact with people.  It wasn't okay. 
[01:01:00]  You got to get, get the joke.  Boom, boom, boom.  They, they, there was a breathing that they allowed that made their interviews really interesting.  And that's why he would have Brando out there for the whole fucking show.  And he would get to talk to Marlon Brando for the whole show.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I love the fact that he's kind of just, I don't know if this is going to where we want  it to go.  Is that sure?  Is, is, is there.  What are you about?  It's fine.  No, it might be like, let's see, let's see.  I, I, I, this might be a little more.  We've had a whole audience in the bag before, but this is interesting. 
[01:01:30]  Let us, listen, let us go away for just a moment.  Talk to you about something.  We'll be right back after this message of interest with, uh, you know, whom.  I guess you all know that, um, that, uh, John Lennon, uh, together with the three other  fellows, uh, named, uh, McCartney and Harrison and the star, uh, were responsible for becoming,  uh, I guess the most written about, most listened to, most imitated, uh, musical group,  uh, of the sixties. 
[01:02:00]  And for about eight years, uh, they were leaders in the musical world and not only that, but  it probably affected what, um, a decade of young people, uh, looked like and thought about  and dreamed of and, uh, they achieved the absolute pinnacles of success.  They were even honored by the queen, an honor which they eventually, uh, returned, I believe.  Uh, I'm sure it doesn't, uh, come as a surprise to anyone that the Beatles are no longer together.  What?  Um, in, in recent months, John Lennon and, uh, has, well, John has sort of surfaced in the 
[01:02:30]  underground press where he gave a long interview in a Rolling Stone magazine, which he talked  with some, a great deal of candor and, uh, some, uh, bitterness, I suppose, about the  old days.  And his wife, Yoko Ono, is maybe, uh, uh, one of the most controversial ladies since the  Duchess of Windsor, uh, Wally Simpson, uh, kept the, uh, Duke from becoming the king.  Uh, uh, tonight they are, however, quite above ground.  This is gold, Jerry.  And I'm very pleased to welcome them here.  Will you welcome, please, John Ono Lennon and Yoko Ono. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, he changed his name, too?  Oh, yeah, he was, uh, what a weirdo.  Well, she must have fucked his brains out.  You think that was it, yeah?  She fucking, she took that Beatle dick and fucking tap danced on it.  Like Mata Hari.  She fucked his brains out.  So his name was John Ono Lennon at this point?  I'm John Ono Lennon.  And she was Yoko what?  Ono Lennon.  Yoko Lennon Ono?  How'd she say her name?  It's interchangeable. 
[01:03:30]  It's so stupid.  Yeah, I don't know where the announcement was.  Maybe they made it before the episode actually aired.  Yeah, maybe.  Wow.  They were in love.  What the hell?  But Jesus.  You know what?  She must have fucked.  She did something to him.  Yeah.  That no one's ever done.  She probably said one thing that triggered this chemical in his brain that just never fucking went.  Like, you know, they were probably eating a pussy one time and she maybe grabbed his fucking head full of beetle hair and said, and put her ass on his nose and said, sniff it, dog. 
[01:04:00]  She did something.  This is wonderful.  Yeah.  She did something that changed his life for him.  Turned him into a zombie.  Turned him into a fucking zombie.  Let's hear a little more of that.  Yeah, Sam.  I want to see how the interview starts.  He's in his normal.  Ten and ten, ten.  Jesus.  His normal army jacket.  Fetal boots.  Bell bottoms. 
[01:04:30]  Hello.  How are you?  Nervous, but okay.  It looks like we're in a parade literally on the side of her head.  A little bit.  But it isn't as if we've never met because we did meet once.  We did meet in a dingy hotel room.  So you're Jack Lemmon.  Yes.  And you're Fred Astaire.  Or is it Orson Welles? 
[01:05:00]  I'm not Fred Astaire.  Yoko, how are you?  Fine, thank you.  Good, good, okay.  Is there anything that you want to know about me to start off with?  Just to sort of get the...  What do you do for a living?  That's funny.  Actually, this is my profession.  I know it's...  You live here.  Yeah.  I practically do.  I hardly ever get out of here.  A chair collapses into a bed.  It must be hard.  It's a bit of a...  Do you have my kind of show all over the world? 
[01:05:30]  You haven't been everywhere.  They're not quite as good, you know?  They what?  They're not quite as good in England at repartee, you know?  Jesus.  What an awkward interview.  They're more uninhibited, don't you?  They don't have anybody.  They would sort of freak out a little.  Wow.  Horrible camera.  Right there.  Everything.  It's just so archaic.  Yeah.  That's kind of...  Just because it's John Lennon doesn't mean it's going to be genius.  Well, Lennon did, but Lennon didn't do a lot of TV interviews.  No.  No.  Brando was awkward when he came out. 
[01:06:00]  He was terrible.  You see Brando when he came out, and the first few minutes are weird.  Yeah.  It's fucking weird.  Maybe that's worth playing.  That's strange.  Find Brando on Dick Cavett.  It was just...  When Brando came out, you just realized that even to Cavett, he's this, you know, he's  fucking Marlon Brando, and he was just a weird guy.  And, uh, yeah.  This is Brando walking out.  He's got a Scarfather.  This is after the Godfather, obviously.  Right after, right? 
[01:06:30]  Right after the last time we were in Paris.  I'm guessing he was a ponytail.  And he sits down in those wonderful chairs.  1973.  1973.  Wow.  He looks good to him, man.  He's, like, a little bit older, but he's still...  Yeah, he looks gruff.  Looks like a tough guy.  Yeah.  You can see he's got his hair a little bit, but he still looks at the fucking...  Boy, what an ovation.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  They love him.  Bigger than love of him.  Now he's just going to be a weirdo.  Damn.  I guess, um, how are you would be as good as anything you're looking to.  I'm kind of weary.  Are you wiped out from the jet trip?  Yeah.  Jet trip.  Yeah.  I appreciate the amount of miles you have been covering to get here. 
[01:07:30]  And you've been...  You were delayed, and it was a ghastly story.  But it's nice of you to come and put up with it all.  I'm so self-conscious.  I don't know what to do.  Because we spoke on the...  We spoke on the phone for over six hours.  And a lot of it was about...  Jesus.  ...what neither of us can stand about this kind of program.  To the point where I know I don't know how to avoid all that stuff.  Will you help me as we move along?  Well, I think that we, uh...  I had a special, uh, treat. 
[01:08:00]  Because you allowed me to come into your, your life.  It's a funny picture.  And it describes his background as a young boy in Nebraska.  Which I think would be worth telling for about 20 minutes.  Do you mind if I go into all that?  Levinick.  I've suddenly forgotten it all.  Yeah.  Um, anyway, I, uh...  Have you seen any good movies lately?  I've never...  Super rich shadow?  What?  Oh, I...  That's supposed to be in my dressing room. 
[01:08:30]  Look at some tag on his, uh, desk.  That's really part of the, part of the commercial.  Um, where was that?  Wow!  Do you go to the movies?  Come to think of it.  He's just staring.  Once in a while.  Yeah.  Oh, wow!  This is so uncomfortable.  I'll tell you what happened.  We, we talked on the phone.  Jesus.  And at one point in the conversation,  you reeled off about seven or eight things that you had observed about me watching the show. 
[01:09:00]  Um, about how I sometimes don't like people and pretend that I do and vice versa.  Uh, and, and about a dozen more.  And they were so uncanny and on the nose that I decided I could never work again.  And now, now I, I feel it.  Would you like a glass of water?  A bug just flew out of my glass.  I know it.  I'm terribly embarrassed.  Wow.  As he said, before the water, a bug flew out. 
[01:09:30]  Probably a critic.  Anyway.  Francis is drinking his water.  Let me ask you an obligatory question and we can get that out of the way right now.  And if at any time I get into things that you don't want to talk about, um, give me a second.  It feels like this torture.  Put you out, yeah.  That'd be fine.  If you had the Academy Awards night to do over again, would you do any of that differently?  Well, um, I, I don't think so, no. 
[01:10:00]  I felt that, um, that there was an opportunity for, since the American Indian hasn't been able  to hear his voice heard.  That's the Colonel Kurtz voice, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, anywhere in the history of the United States, uh, I felt that it was a marvelous opportunity 
[01:10:30]  for an Indian to be able to voice his opinion to 85 million people.  I guess that was the number.  How did they get him to do any work?  It's amazing.  How does the director get him to do anything?  What Hollywood has done to him?  Um, and, uh, I was embarrassed for Shashin.  She wasn't able to say what she intended to say.  Good job.  Yeah, you send up some American Indian woman that doesn't know what to do. 
[01:11:00]  I don't even think she was American Indian.  Yeah, what was she?  Italian, I think, an actress.  Really?  I believe it's hilarious.  Perhaps it was directed, uh, myself.  Yeah.  They should have at least had the courtesy to listen to her.  But, uh, I think she did very well.  And I was, uh, I was...  His voice is amazing, though.  I was very glad that she did have...  I just want to listen to him talk for fucking hours, but anything.  ...to say what she did.  And, uh...  But Zini's a pimp. 
[01:11:30]  Entire statement as you planned it.  Well, I think that they felt it was inappropriate.  And, um...  Just pause for a second, because this is what I love about it.  Even though it might be hard to listen to on the radio, I don't know.  Well, he doesn't rush for anyone, though.  Man, right?  He's just...  He just is...  He's refusing to rush.  Like, he's not...  He feels...  Unless he's hiding it, zero pressure to give people in the audience what you would think 
[01:12:00]  they want.  Anything.  And he's 100% saying what he wants to say.  Yeah.  And back in 1973, no one's turning this off.  No one.  They're just mesmerized.  Like, holy fuck, what's going on here?  Because you didn't hear these guys talk.  This was real moments.  Yeah.  Not polished shit like we were discussing earlier.  You hadn't read, like, 10,000 Twitter posts from Marlon Brando back then.  Right.  Where I was TMZ walking out of an airplane with his fucking pants around his ankles.  I farted!  You know, or whatever it is. 
[01:12:30]  Right.  This was Brando's speech, though.  No one got to hear this.  Amazing.  Pretty fucked up.  All right, we should take a break.  Oh, yeah, I got some food.  We got food.  I'm gonna eat.  Got things to do.  God damn it.  So you stay right there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues.  Woman is the leader of the world, yes, she knew what to think about. 
[01:13:00]  Woman is the leader of the world, yes, she knew what to think about.  Woman is the leader of the world, yes, she knew what to do, yes, she knew what to think about.  Girl, I know, is it what to think about how to do something about? 
[01:13:30]  We make her pay to face a singer.  If she won't be a slave, we say that she don't love.  If she's real, we say that she's trying to be a man.  I'm putting her down to pretend that she's a boss  Woman is the figure of the world 
[01:14:00]  Yes, she is  If you don't believe me, take a look at the walking wheel  Woman is the slave of the slaves  Oh yeah, better scream back  Yeah  Fuck  You know how many guys didn't get their laundry done after this song came out? 
[01:14:30]  What a pussy  He's ruining it for all of us  Yes  The clip they showed from the interview on last night on the Filosank show  He said like the people that got mad at him  He said yeah, there were some people that got mad at me  But they were like white and mostly men  That was who of course got mad at him  What a weird influence Yoko had on him though  Yeah  Really strange  She probably told him to write that song while he was worshipping her feet  Right  You were right, woman in need of words 
[01:15:00]  That's it  Yeah  All right  There's a great YouTube bit going on  It's been going on for a little while  Yoko did like a performance at a museum  Oh  And  Yeah, thanks Jay  It's Jay underscore Giordano on Twitter  He's a good one  I like  I like his tweets  He tweeted the YouTube clip of Yoko doing pop songs  It's a little bit that's going on on YouTube  And 
[01:15:30]  I don't understand why people fucking take her so fucking seriously for all these years  Because she fucked John Lennon, period  It's just a letter J, not spell out J  Yeah, but  She walks up to the microphone and just starts screaming  And I guess, you know, you can't question what art is  I understand that  Yeah, but  But  But it's garbage  But it's garbage  Pure, pure garbage  But you know garbage when you see it, right?  Yes  But others would say, well, that's, you know, it's garbage to you 
[01:16:00]  It's art to  There's nothing  That's why I start hearing  There's nothing thought-provoking or moving or anything  It's just annoying  It's like  Then  Then a tire screeching  Right  On pavement  Is art  Alright, so it's art  But let's get some different categories in the art world  Yeah, there's shit art  That's shit art  And she's doing shit art  I will stand behind the duty hat being 
[01:16:30]  Way more  Something I would love to see in a museum before Yoko Ono  Yeah  Stepping up to the microphone and just screaming  So they took her screaming  And it's a little YouTube bit that's been going on for a while  And now what you get here is Yoko Ono covering the Adele song Someone Like You  Which is a beautiful song by Adele  With that lovely voice I heard  Wonderful  And this is Yoko's interpretation  At an art museum 
[01:17:00]  Standing up against wall  Yoko's going to dramatically walk up to the microphone  There she goes  There's no one here, by the way  It's just like Corey Feldman  It's amazing, right? 
[01:17:30]  She stinks  This is infuriating to watch her dance  Now White's infuriating  There's way better artists that don't get any fucking attention  She's talentless  She really is  She is a fucking zilch  That's her version of Adele 
[01:18:00]  It's just utter garbage  Did you play her version of Firecracker?  That one's really good  The Firecracker's better, though  I mean, I didn't love it, but it's better than this  Firecracker  She does a great performance of Firecracker by Katy Perry  But you're right, it's utter garbage  That's exhaustive  It's garbage  What did I say?  Oh, Firecracker  Fireworks, of course  Oh, there you go  I know this song  Yeah  She does a much better job with this one  Another Yoko Ono cover 
[01:18:30]  All she did was fuck Lennon  You're right, Jimmy  This one's way better  Way better  She's 
[01:19:00]  Nervous ticking  Yeah  Do you think it's written or she's making it up as she goes along?  A little bit about that  And everybody watching is thinking she stinks  Yes  And yet, no one has the balls to go  You blow  An empty room with one mic in the middle that she steps up to  Dramatically  Pompous idiot  She's a pompous idiot 
[01:19:30]  Screaming  That's how stupid the art world is  Yeah  That's how dumb they are  Well, not really  I mean, the people  There's not many people there  And they're laughing at her  She walks through a crowd, though, after us  I've seen this  There was a little press conference, I guess  That she was going to do this Katy Perry song  Yeah  Too bad she didn't scream like this outside the Dakota  Before it all went down  Because Mark David Chapman would have dropped the gun and run  Right  And ran  Excuse me 
[01:20:00]  Does she cover any other songs, Sam?  Oh, she's fucking  What else does she cover?  Treacherously bad  Oh, this will be a good one  Which one does she cover?  I'm Sexy and I Know It by LMFAO  Oh, let's see how she covers that one  Something a little more dance-y  Yeah, yeah, yeah  She's got range  Oh, yeah  We all know this song  Let's see how she does  It sounds like fireworks  It does 
[01:20:30]  She's obviously like  Was married to a very talented guy  And she looks at him as like  Oh, he sings and plays music  I would love to do that 
[01:21:00]  But I have no talent whatsoever  So I'm just going to warble  But he placated to her  And she took over the stage  She's a bellowing idiot  She completely influenced the guy  To the point  He brings her around for that super fucking band thing they did  And she wrecks one of those songs  You've got to find that  I thank Jay Moore to this day  For turning me on to Rock and Roll Circus  An amazing documentary  Where everyone is really fucked up  And they're wearing rain slickers in the audience  Yeah  And then at the end 
[01:21:30]  They did their huge over-the-top jam  And Yoko Ono was included  And ruined the whole fucking thing  And nobody respects her artistically  But no one said  Hey, John  How about you tell her no this time?  Nobody  John never told her no  Do you got it?  She's been slapped on the nose  And told no like a dog  We've played a few times in the past  And we have found the video  I have the audio  I just  The video is pretty amazing though  Because you can see 
[01:22:00]  Everyone is just fucked up  Tripping their faces off  My nose is  Rock and Roll Circus it's called  Right, okay  Hmm  Oh  We've got Keith Richards  We've got John Lennon  I think Ian Anderson is there  Look at him  They're all wearing this rain shit  In the audience  He used to bring that lump with him  He was a dick for doing it too 
[01:22:30]  Of course  He really is  Hmm  That's fucking rockin' the fiddle  Right  Yeah  Crazy  They're all fucking stung  We were all out of tune  Right  Look at Keith Richards in the back  You know how annoyed you must have been  To see her get up at her dumb fucking rain  Right  John Lennon  I think you got someone from Hendrix up there 
[01:23:00]  And Yoko's just standing on the stage  She's valueless  And this is not even a good jam  To be honest with you  I'm not sure if this is  The long jam is terrible  You know this  Stinks  That's on the violin  Yeah  Beat it  Uh oh  Yoko's trying to get on the mic  Look at him just kind of stand there  With a fucking arm tight  He's trying to get on mic 
[01:23:30]  Oh John just fucking went like this  Did you see  His head went  Go ahead  Get on mic  Can you rewind that  Like he's fucking  Yeah  He liked what she did  Go back a little bit  Watch  Watch what he does  Watch  Look at this  She looks at him at one point  And he's like  Go  He says go  Yeah but he kind of shrugs 
[01:24:00]  Like go  I would have a headache  Look at that  Oh fuck  I know there's other guys up there too  Oh  Jesus Christ  Are you kidding me  The fiddle player's laughing now  She's ruining everything 
[01:24:30]  Yes  Did her clapton?  Does clapton have to deal with this shit?  Might have been that cock blocker  You guys trying to play fiddle louder?  Yeah  He's trying to drown her out  She's just screaming 
[01:25:00]  Look at the fiddle guy  Like what is this fucking bitch doing?  Yeah there's a fucking short cousin  He's making noise next to me  Have you done one  And bouncing and enjoying it  That stone moron  Look they're all laughing  They're all laughing too  What an abomination  She sucks 
[01:25:30]  I wonder if this is also  Lenin was just so disinterested  At this point  All this adulation he was getting  It's like he was bored  She thinks she's doing something here  She's not contributing to this at all  She's ruining it  She can't just sing  Anyone can do that 
[01:26:00]  Oh he used to fucking take that fiddle bow  And just start beating her over the head  You'd be out of jail already  What a hero you'd be  What an asshole John Lennon was  Yeah  What just an asshole  To even allow this  Get your chick off the stage  Yeah  But if you wanted him  You had to tolerate him  It's half older by the way  It just keeps going and going 
[01:26:30]  Yeah that is Clapton  So you got Clapton  You got Keith Richards  You got John Lennon  I don't recognize the drummer  But I'm sure he's from  Hendrix or something like that  Yeah yeah  Experience  Yeah every guy up there  Is a superstar in the rock world  And then you got Yoko Ono  He brings his fucking shit  Jesus how embarrassing  He brings his blood  This could be like me  Fucking fighting at the juggalos  Like this is the best they could come up with  Having all that talent on one stage 
[01:27:00]  You know  I'm just looking at all the subtleties in this  Like at one point Clapton just gazed over  Like Keith Richards  Because like what the fuck  Why did we agree to this  And now she's smiling  Like she just did something huge  And these stoned assholes  Don't know what they're fucking clapping at  Oh look at her just standing there  Trying to be part of the mix  It's infuriating right 
[01:27:30]  All these years later  It makes me sick  She doesn't deserve to fucking  Lick the boots of anyone on that stage  It's called Rock and Roll Circus  Jay Moore  A long time ago  Turned me on to it  It's a great documentary  It's so fucking weird  They should call it a circus  Because it's a whole bunch of  Just tricksters  The Opie and Anthony Show  The Opie and Anthony Show  The Sirius XM  Sirius XM 
[01:28:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  If you're ever in a fight  And you're beating one of us  Break out  Before you get bum rushed  The Wild Wild West  The Wild Wild West  Yeah  Wild Wild West  Wild Wild West  This was a big hit, huh?  Wild Wild West  Wild Wild West  Wild Wild West  It was that fantasy of a black posse  In the Wild West  Not being hung 
[01:28:30]  Because like  It was a very  Well it depends on  But you know  It's just a myth  Oh okay  Maybe that was it  Why are we playing  The Wild Wild West?  Wild Wild West  Cool Moe D's birthday  It was Cool Moe D  Cool Moe D  How old is Cool Moe D?  51  51?  51  Damn  I would have went with The Edge  52 today  The Edge is 52  52  And Dustin Hoffman  Is 76 years young  Damn  Wild Wild Wild West  Wild Wild West 
[01:29:00]  I had the long ride in again  This morning  And I was  I'm trying to be a company guy  For Sirius XM  Good man  Trying  How's it working out for you?  It's very hard  But I'm trying  I'm giving it the old  College try  But I'm trying Ringo  I'm trying real hard  Right  To be a company man  I start at Channel 2  On Sirius  Which is like pop music  And I just start going forward  Yeah  And so I got to hear Sam  Like intro a song  Yep  That Clarity or Tragedy song 
[01:29:30]  Clarity  And it's Frozen  In there or something  So he said  Well it's tough  To get into this song  In the summertime  Because it's Frozen  Or something  So yeah I listen  Okay  I think that's what you said  About that song  I think  I don't remember  I don't really put a lot of thought  Into that anymore  Really  Does that end  Yeah  Yeah  Really  Puts more thought  Into his wardrobe  That's right  He was worried about  What he was wearing  I think  I've been properly 
[01:30:00]  Introing the Clarity  Tragedy song  Whatever the fuck  It's called  I don't even know  Did it occur to you  For a second  When you were getting dressed  You were in front of the mirror  This morning  It's like  They're probably gonna  Goof on me about this  Of course  Yeah  But he's gonna ride it out  Yeah  Because this is what  He wants to do now  Yeah  Because I don't give a fuck  You know  Whoa  That's me  Shit  Damn  Damn  I got no fucks to give  You don't give a fuck  I don't  So then I moved on  To the next pop channel  And they had something on  And then I made it  To the 40s on 4 
[01:30:30]  I even stopped there  For a little bit  And then eventually  I get up to the  Pearl Jam channel  And fucking Margaritaville  See company man here  You were sampling  A little Grateful Dead  The Jam channel  The fucking Pop 2K  I just keep going  And the 40s on 4  Yeah  There was a song on there  They were singing  About Connecticut  Oh really  Connecticut is like  The greatest place  On earth  According to this song  Connecticut 
[01:31:00]  Connecticut  They were singing  About Connecticut  And it was two  Massive stars of the era  Singing about Connecticut  Who was the massive stars  Judy Garland  Wow  And Bing Crosby  And I guess  Connecticut  Used to be a magical place  Somewhere over  Bridgeport  Yeah  And I was like  I listened to the whole song  I'm like  Yeah  Why the fuck  Would you ever just sing  About Connecticut  But they did back in the day  Wow 
[01:31:30]  Do you have the song?  I think it's called  Connecticut  Connecticut  Connect  Let's listen to a piece of this  4.30 in the morning  This is what I'm listening to  I know a spot  Peaceful and fair  I'd be so happy  If I were there  See  No matter where I chance to live  Connecticut is the place for me 
[01:32:00]  Miss every lake  Miss every hill  Even in dreams  I think of them still  And when you see them  You'll agree  Connecticut is the place to be  Why?  I was like  I got paid by Connecticut  To sing this  I was going to say  Yeah  I'm going to sit  The Connecticut Board of Tourism  From the coloreds in Hartford  To the  Land of dreams 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, right?  Keep them there  Good point  It's a land of dreams  This Connecticut place  Is it  It's Bing?  Yes, I believe so  Did I get that off?  Bing Crosby was in a movie  Called  A Connecticut Yankee  In King Arthur's Court  Is this from that?  So maybe there's a song  From the movie  But why would you even make a movie  About Connecticut?  I don't know  Connecticut is the place  Coming  They're selling it though  Oh, the engines built casinos 
[01:33:00]  To bilk the white man  It's the long stretch of road  On your way to Boston  The most boring state to drive through  Oh, she's stepping it up  You'll find the chicks  Slicker  And then  Oh, with dicks  Right  Yeah, why don't you rhyme that word properly? 
[01:33:30]  You'll find the chicks  Chicks with big dicks  Indiana can't raise  This is a cool song  It's called  I Do Heroin  And He Beats His Kids  Men Are Scones  Wow  Yeah  I was thinking of a good  Kid Beating joke too  I was trying to figure out  If Judy Garland ever did her with it  Yeah, I believe she did  Wow  Yeah  Fuck  Capri  Oh, she uses one of our favorite  Terms too  In the song 
[01:34:00]  Yeah  Blinger longer  In Connecticut  Connecticut still will be my home  Is she from Connecticut?  I hope so  She was for the three and a half minute song she did with Big Crosby  She wouldn't live in Connecticut with the tickets  My kids, I love to hit in Connecticut  I like the whole beating his children angle  I love it  Yeah  Oh  They're singing two different lines now 
[01:34:30]  Oh  I beat my children all over my home  Connecticut always will be my home  Woo  Yeah  That was nice  That's what I heard on the way in  Connecticut  That's my update on Sirius XM  That's great  What I'm finding out there  Yeah  Mmm  Oh, I love Iowa

[01:36:00]  And then I  Yeah, I did  And then they followed it up with Benny Goodman  But he had  Did Benny sing?  I don't think  And he played that  So then the singer gets the  Little licorice stick  I heard a clarinet  I heard a Benny Goodman song  And somebody was singing  Yeah  And so you would assume  Oh, that's Benny Goodman  But no  That guy didn't get any credit  No, that's true  Wow  You really did sample  Yeah  And then I keep just going 
[01:36:30]  Further up and up and up  And up and up  Dude, Judy Garland was  She died of an overdose  Of barbiturates  She was married five times  Ugh  She must have been a joy to be with  No kidding  Fucking, what a  Pilled out fucking  Oh, yeah  You know what her real name was?

Yeah  Yeah  Especially in New York  But you're being robbed  So  Yeah  Property does not necessarily mean you can take a life  But you're minding your own business  Next thing you're in trouble  There's a guy that they show that had this happen to him  And he saw it as it was happening  It went to run after the car  And it's just out of his reach  The car fucking drives away  And you're thinking like  God if you have a gun  You got to be so tempted  To just un-fucking-load into the back window 
[01:41:00]  You're so mad  But you can't do that  Fucking you know  I think you should be able to do that  You should be able to  If you're minding your own business to begin with  Yes  I know certain states do have  Where you can use deadly force  To protect your property  They're the cool states  Like Texas and stuff  But there are also guidelines to that  But New York  Forget about it  You pretty much gotta  Be on the brink of death  Getting the shit beat out of you  And still  You know

[01:44:30]  Poking through the little rubber thing  So all that shit  Doesn't pour down your throat  And then they give you the oxygen  And then there's a big  Funnel-y tube thing  That is a vacuum  And it's sucking the air  Away from  Your mouth  Because  That  That mercury filling shit  Gets in the air  Oh wow  So it's like  You're cleaning out asbestos  Wow  It's crazy  Yeah  Who thought it was a good idea  For us to have this  One of the kids  Crazy  So  So they started that process yesterday 
[01:45:00]  And  How many did they do?  Two  And they got me a crown  A temporary crown  Over here  And then  I go back in a couple weeks  And they do more work and shit  When are you getting your horse teeth?  I'm not getting horse teeth  I'm getting what are called  Veneers  Oh no  They're called  And it begins  Veneers  They go on the side of Vin's head  Actually was a funny one  Vin ears  Didn't it have really white teeth? 
[01:45:30]  No  That's just it  Are you sure?  They make these things  The hair thing worked out great for you  But don't come in here with horse teeth  No  Get them fucking Hollywood white  Look  Look  Everyone's afraid because of Rich Voss  We're all petrified  Right  From the Voss debacle  I'd rather have a mouth of rotting teeth  Than come in looking like  He used to  It's  He got it fixed finally  He did  But what they do with the veneers  They're matched  Color wise  To real teeth 
[01:46:00]  It's not like this white stark thing  They look  Amazingly natural  And real  They're veneers  They're fucking so thin  And they adhere  To the fronts of your teeth  Show me some veneers  In a way that  That doesn't  And don't put veneer fucking  Faux paws  On there  Put epic fail  And veneers  Oh no  No  Oh really  Look what Snooki did  I'm not going to be Snooki white  That's horrible  Is that really veneers? 
[01:46:30]  They're too white  No that's way too fucking white  That's too white  That's dumb  No I am  I don't think I'd ever hear you say that  I have an amazing dentist now  And um  See her teeth were fine  Why would  Dr. Zell  Zell  What a dope  And then they  They didn't even put them in right  Because they're too wide or something  It's a vice engine  Um  Anyone else notice that Snooki's teeth  Are way too  They go out to the sides  Yeah  Too much  Yeah  Someone fucked up  No 
[01:47:00]  I am getting  Veneers  And they are um  Very natural looking  That's all I want  That's what they're telling you  No  It is  I swear  I swear  Yeah  And uh  So they're doing all the prelim work  Right now  With taking care of all the old silver fillings  And shit  And we don't have dental insurance  No  This is all cash on the barrel head  Why can't we get dental insurance?  Like yesterday  What they did yesterday  Is she took the fillings out of two teeth 
[01:47:30]  Right  She um filled them with the uh white filling stuff  Sure  And then put a cap  Or a crown  A temporary crown  And then I also paid for when I come back  To put the permanent crown  Because they do the impression and everything  Um  Oh god  And uh  Let's see  More veneers  That's terrible  No that's just terrible  That's like a Hollywood guy  So you know he went to the best place  It was $2,300  For just that  Out of pocket  Two teeth 
[01:48:00]  Yeah yeah  Just  Unbelievable  I fucking hand my Amex over  Yeah put it on that  Jesus  For two teeth  Two teeth  That's why people  And I gotta fuck a load more to do  That's why people let their teeth rot  They can't afford it  Can't afford it  A lot of  Most people don't have dental at this point right  The world needs ditch stickers too you know  This is cosmetic  No dental would cover this anyway  Yeah it's a cosmetic thing  But  As a cosmetic procedure  I can probably write this shit off  On my taxes  The government allows you that Norton  Cause you go on TV  Yeah 
[01:48:30]  I gotta get a root canal today  My first root canal  Are those bad?  Yes  They used to be  Now  It sounds and feels  Not pain wise  But the procedure feels weird  A cavity being filled  You never had one?  A root canal?  No  Look at me  Of course I haven't  It's weird  It's weird  They feel like they're pulling out with a corkscrew  They feel like they're  They twist these things in  These little screws  Into the roots of your teeth 
[01:49:00]  It goes  They're not pulling roots out right?  Yeah  I thought they were  I thought  The what?  No they  Root canal  They're gunning your roots  They pull the roots out of the  I'm not getting this done  Fuck that  What happens if you don't get it done?  You get a fucking infection  I had the infection  Yeah it'll come back  And it feels great  Just like my dentist said  I'm on penicillin  Because it got infected  And now it's better  He goes  You're going to feel great again  But still get it done  I'm like no  I'm cured  I'm not going  No they gouge the root out 
[01:49:30]  They rip it out  Of the tooth  There's a couple of roots there  Nerves  They take the nerves  And all the pulp and everything  In the root  And pull it out  And they fill the canal up  With cement  You know  They fucking fill it up  And you hope they get the whole root  Because if they don't  There's a fucking problem  Then it gets infected  And they gotta go back  But a good dentist  Will fucking get that  And then they put a crown  On top of it  Will this ruin my smile?  It'll still be a guileless smile  Remember  I was described as having a guileless 
[01:50:00]  What's that mean?  I don't fucking know  Fucking chick  That can't get a boyfriend  Yeah she's guileless  What are you  An old spinster or something?  Good one  Thanks  Make sure when you get  They give you novocaine  Request benzatine  That numbs the root  Like the second half of that word  Benzatine will numb the root  I heard he grew up though  Yeah he should be a benzatoddler 
[01:50:30]  I'm a fucking pussy at the dentist too  I am bad  If they don't give you benzatine  A lot of times the root  Does not get numb properly  And you feel it halfway through  So say I want benzatine  He might say well you don't need that  Say I'd like it though  It's not that  I don't even know if it's extra money  It's like propofol  Whatever  It's like when you request  Really?  No no no  You request propofol  Fuck I don't want to be Michael Jackson  No no no not the same drug  Just get a root canal  But you have to ask for propofol  They fucking hit yesterday  Because it was two teeth on the bottom  Right  They hit that fucking  Back of the jawbone nerve 
[01:51:00]  You can't swallow anymore  Half your head  I know  I would just scratch my head  Over my ear  And it's like  It's numb  Half my head was numb  I wish you were scratching it  With a pistol  I was a numb skull  But it fucking  She was drilling  And they always say like  If you feel any  You know  Discomfort  Let me know  And she's drilling away  And then they get that big drill  Where it's like 
[01:51:30]  You're going to feel some vibration  And she goes  And it feels like  The drill bit is spinning  At like one RPM  And it's just gouging shit out  Like an auger  Jesus  You know  Why are you making it worse?  Oh sorry  And then I just go on my Twitter  This guy goes  They gas you  I don't remember shit  And it didn't hurt at all  So good  By the way  I made up benzatine  I don't think it exists  Oh no  That would have been funny  If it didn't sound right  I wanted them to ask for benzatine  Do you get any benzatine?  You got any cyanide?  Jimmy says I should  I'm such a pussy  Are ya? 
[01:52:00]  That I've had novocaine  To get my teeth cleaned  Oh wow  No  I swear to god  I'm the worst  Not the topical little thing  And in general  I'm alright with pain  But for something  For some fucking reason  That's sharp  The teeth  I don't know what it is  Tooth pain  Even if it's just  A fleeting like  For a second  Not even a second  You remember it  And it's right by your brain  You feel  You see white  It's so painful  For a split second  Yeah  That's the good part  You know how you bang  Your foot  It takes a second 
[01:52:30]  With the tooth  It's so close  To the brain  It's like  The pain just has to  Sidestep over  And go  Hello  Hello  How do you do  You're like  Hey thou  Hey thou  Hey thou  Thanks man  I'm okay in the dentist  Oh yeah  I don't mind the dentist  We got a good one  We and Jimmy share everything  We do  Yeah  But he's good  Did you see  Did you see the eyebrows yet  I did not  On him  No  I don't know if she listens 
[01:53:00]  Maybe I should shut up  Oh  Well we could bring Mars in here  But certain people out there  What the big trend is  They shave their eyebrows  And they tattoo them in  Tattoo or pencil  No  And someone me and Jimmy know  Did just that  Did she speak perfect English  Perfect English  No  What is it  Oh  Oh my god 
[01:53:30]  She's a crazy woman  She doesn't listen  Oh my god  Tattooed her eyebrows  But that's what they do  I swear Captain Carl  She takes her eyebrows  She plucks them all out  Then she draws them in  She goes  Mars could let us in on this  The Hispanic community  There is people that will  Shave their eyebrows  And they will tattoo them in  That's the thing  That's weird  Look it up  Look it up Sam  Tattoo your eyebrows  And someone we know did that  And my whole thought on the thing  Is I can't imagine doing that 
[01:54:00]  It would hurt  Right  Wow  Yeah  Why would you do that  Maybe they were falling out  Or maybe they were fucking weird  Or  Maybe they grew way too quick  Oh that just looks silly  Oh shit  Oh god  What do you mean hotline  I don't have a phone here  That looks weird  Hotline  Who's on the hotline  I don't see anything  Are we being hotlined  I don't see anything here  Is it Bruce Mittman  Yelling at us  I just thought we were having  A shitty show  Not one phone call yet  Oh man  Oh yeah the phones are dead  In here by the way 
[01:54:30]  I didn't even notice  You can't answer the phone  At all there  No who's on the hotline  That would be Rich Voss  Maybe if we had a phone  Here in the middle of the console  We'd be able to answer the phone  Here comes Mars  Mars doesn't run as fast  As it used to  Hey Mars  Do people fucking tattoo  Their eyebrows in  In your community  Yes they do  But I don't hang out  With those type of people  On newborns  Like they do  The pierced ears  You hear this guy  Remember that  He doesn't hang out 
[01:55:00]  With those people  Oh  He's allowed to say that  Because he's you know  Self-hating  Biologically is one of those people  But not  You're a self-hating Spaniard  Oh you're fucked up over there  Yeah  Oh  Oh  Yeah  Server  Incorrect  Connection  Connection  I'll be your server today  There it is  Holy fuck  A lot of people are calling  We're having a pretty good show  Oh man  The phones are lit  Holy shit  We're doing good  Whatever the phones are lit  We're doing good today Mars  Look how much happier we are 
[01:55:30]  We thought we were having  A shitty show  Because no one was calling  So what's up with the eyebrows  I don't know  I really don't know  But you've seen it right  Yeah I've seen it  And mostly Hispanics no  Yeah but you know  What's happening now too  They're tattooing the eyeballs  Stop  With what  Tattooing the eyeballs  I mean not with what  That was the dumbest  Why  That's not a dumb question  What would you tattoo your eyeballs with  That's weird  I guess they do it with this ink  Yeah  No but what are they  The Mengele experiment  What are they coloring in  The whites 
[01:56:00]  Oh okay that  What do you mean they're coloring in the whites  Like they'll make it red or whatever  Why would you want it red  You do it a lot in prison  Yeah I want to do it  Oh no I thought you meant it  In the Hispanic community  These are crazy people  Oh no we know about that  Yeah no  Let me see that  It's mostly prisoners and shit  Prisoners crazy people  I want that  Like some devil boy or something  That's gotta fuck  And we're talking about dentists  Having a little pain  When we get our cavities filled  Look at these fucking lunatics  And what they're doing  They must have to numb it  How the fuck do you do that  What kind of pain in your life  Are you covering up  Where you could take a tattoo needle 
[01:56:30]  To your eyeball  And be okay with it  I can't even take a piece of sand  No  A piece of sand  I'm crying  It sucks  It won't come out  It still hurts  Can you flush my eye out  I have an eyelash in my eye  Could you find it  Did you see it  Could you find it  These guys are getting tattooed  In your eyeball  Holy fuck  Thank you nay  No fucking way  I would say that's worse  Than getting like  One of those Prince Alberts  Yeah  The whites of your eyes  Are white for a reason 
[01:57:00]  I would think  Or one of those split penis things  I think  I think tattooing your eyeball  Has to be the worst thing  You can do  The split penis  It's like when you leave  A hot dog on the grill  Too long  Right  Right  What's a Prince Albert  Ah  You ever have Prince Albert  In a can  What is it really  It's like a big huge  Fucking ring  That goes through your  P-hole  And out the shaft  Right  Show him a Prince Albert  Why would people do that  What is the purpose of that  Does anyone know  I don't know  So you can be pulled around  By your penis  I'm sure it's like  It's better for sex

[02:04:30]  A million a day  He was demanding that to be on Expendables 3  So they just said  Go fuck yourself  We've got Harrison Ford  See you later  We've got Harrison Ford  Yeah  So  Wow  Yep  Speaking of movies  We'll do our little movie break  Yeah  I saw Olympus  Has Fallen last night  What is that?  On Demand  It's the first one that came out  With the White House being taken over 
[02:05:00]  By outside forces  The one with Jamie Foxx  It's got  What's his name?  Gerard Butler  Oh okay  Was that the movie came in?  Oh no he didn't come in  He hasn't come in in a while  Yeah yeah  What happened there?  Gerard Butler  Morgan Freeman  Okay  Is in it too  Is he playing Morgan Freeman again?  Yeah  Alright  He's good at that  Morgan Freeman  But he's good at that  Yeah yeah  Can't fault him  I gotta tell ya  I loved it  I did 
[02:05:30]  It is what these movies that try to be like Die Hard  And even the newer Die Hard movies stink  It was  It harkened back to the original Die Hard  Under Siege  Passion  Passenger 57  Like movies like that  It was great  It was fucking  Action packed  A lot of killing  Gerard Butler is a great action guy  Like with that whole  If you remember Die Hard  Bruce Willis  You know  With all the little quips 
[02:06:00]  And fucking  You know  Just tough guy  Guns  It was great  He also has hunk ability  He does have hunk ability  Hunk ability  Is very important  He's got hunk ability  When you get a movie together  Corny  Yes  Fucking  Ridiculous  Okay  Storyline  Yes  But you're not watching it for that  Take the movie  And think of what you want to get from it  I'm not looking for this amazingly  Coherent story  With no loose ends  I want action 
[02:06:30]  Well you beat me to it  Because I was going to tell you  The critics didn't like the movie so much  48%  On Rotten Tomatoes  Audience  71%  Audience  Always higher than the critics though  It was a lot  The beginning  How did it end?  Oh it ends with  White House is okay in the end?  Actually  The  Gerard Butler  Who's a Secret Service guy  And the President  Get married  On the steps of the burning White House  Wow  To prove that gay people are great  That's a hell of an ending 
[02:07:00]  Yes  Are they going to build a new White House though?  I guess so  Alright then  The sequence where they take over the White House  Is pretty cool  It's of course the bad guys are not Muslims  Or Middle Eastern  No why would they be?  Who are they?  Koreans  Why?  We have no problems with them  Well the North Koreans are a little shady  Yeah but we know they're not going to really do anything  But it's not even the North Koreans  It's the South Koreans  It's not even them  It's some Hans Gruber-ish type guy  Oh so they don't even want to commit to  That's Asian  Right 
[02:07:30]  Which Korean it is?  Right  They didn't even want to fucking commit  But I bet you Asian groups are pissed off at that  I bet you  I bet you we can find an article  Where the Asians are pissed off at that  These aren't spoilers  Everyone knows they were Asian  What do they do when they take over the White House?  Are they like sitting in the chair and stuff?  Killing a lot of people  But is there a little comedy  Like they're sitting in the chair?  Oh no  No?  No nothing like that  No?  No  Like looking at a painting of George Washington  Just a little comedy line  Nah  Nothing  Gerard Butler does hit one of the Korean guys over the head 
[02:08:00]  With the Lincoln head bust thing  You know  Fucking well  But there's a lot of really good killing in it  That's cool  High body count at the beginning  Who's the president in this movie?  It's that guy  Did you see him a million times?  Yeah  Like that character actor guy?  He's that guy  He's great to play the president  Which guy though?  I want a picture of him so I can just say  Oh that guy  Who is he?  I guarantee  Don't say his name  I just want to see a picture of him  Show a picture of the president from Olympus has fallen 
[02:08:30]  There he is  Oh that guy  That guy  Alright he was in Batman  There he is  He was half face or whatever the fuck the character's name is  Two face  No I call him half face because he only had half a face Sam  He had the full face but one was on angle  But his name before he was two face was uh  Harvey Dent  Harvey Dent  Of course  Harvey Dent  He was also in that cigarette movie  Yep  Thank you for smoking or thank you for not smoking  Right  Smoking will kill you  Thank you for smoking  He was the president in this  And of course  I'm almost good at pop culture  You get the president 
[02:09:00]  Getting there  And the vice president are out of commission  Yeah  For the movie  For you know  Because there's shit going on  And that's where Morgan Freeman as the speaker of the house  Has to assume the responsibilities of the president of the United States  For the time that they are incapacitated  So he makes some decisions  Wait it goes president vice president  And then speaker of the house  Is third  Yeah  Where's Alexander Haig when you need him 
[02:09:30]  Unless you're Alexander Haig and then you say I'm in charge here at the White House  Right  Here at the White House  I'm in charge  Oh boy was that a faux pas  Was that a gaffe  What happened  And he was sweating  You don't remember Alexander Haig  When Reagan got shot  When Reagan got shot  He basically told the world he's in charge of the White House  Get the clip  It's great  Yeah  Reagan gets shot  What was his position  I don't even know anymore  He was secretary of defense  You found the clip  I do believe  Right  But he wasn't in charge was he  No  No 
[02:10:00]  That's why he was great  He told everybody though  Bush senior vice president at the time  Sure  Was away  He was out of Washington  And when he found out that happened he was flying back  Right  And during that time Alexander Haig thought it would be good to get in front of the press  Sweating  Peeking back and forth  Not looking  Looking like something is a lot worse than it is kind of a thing  And then saying he was in charge  This is from 19  March 30th 1981 
[02:10:30]  Shouldn't it have been speaker of the house?  Yes  Was that Tip O'Neill back then?  I think it was  Possibly yeah  Perhaps Tip O'Neill  But Alexander Haig said fuck the constitution and all that shit  Yeah  I'm in charge  Play this  This is  I love this clip  I haven't seen this in years  CNN wow  This is for the government right now  He's making the decision  Constitutionally  Gentlemen  You have the president  The vice president  And the secretary of state in that order  Secretary of state  And should the president decide he wants to transfer the helm 
[02:11:00]  To the vice president he will do so  As of now I am in control here in the white house  And in return of the vice president and in close touch with him  If something came up I would check with him of course  What is the extent of the president's injuries?  Well as best we know he's had one round into his body  Into the left side  Into the left lung  And there is a surgery underway to remove the round now 
[02:11:30]  He's shaking as well  When the president entered surgery he was conscious  And all his signs were stable  And uh  I'm in charge  The situation is very clear  Wow  Right now  And it doesn't  He didn't even have the  Right  The succession  Correct  Speaker of the fucking house  Right  President  Vice president  And the  The guy in the treasury  That prints the money  I'm in charge here 
[02:12:00]  At the white house  Here  Right now  Right now  And I have the football  And I will be launching nuclear missiles  Haig  Who let him do that?  Al Haig  No one  No one  No one tells Haig what to do  He just called that press conference  That's right  People were so fucking pissed at him for doing that  Really?  Yeah  Yeah  Like there's  You know  There's no time for a press conference  He wanted to just step up  He was going to be the guy 
[02:12:30]  This was going to be his defining historical moment  And boy was it ever  And Sam  I was in Mrs. McCutcheon's 6th grade class  Were you fucking  I was scared  1981  I was in 6th grade class  Mrs. McCutcheon's  They rolled the fucking old school TV in  And we watched that live  Man  As it was going down  Big heavy tube television  That's right  Child of the 80s  Let it warm up  Adjust the aerial  6th grade?

Come on  Let's be real here  When you just said Mrs. McCutcheon  You reminded me  I don't know if I've told this joke on the air  Mrs. McCutcheon  Yeah  But I didn't do it  Oh no  It was early on in my comedy career  And  It's  I don't know  It's embarrassing 
[02:13:30]  I want to hear  It's about  Because there's a town in New Jersey  Called McCutcheon  Yes  I told you that one right?  No I think it's the obvious one  Oh yeah  That we all say  When we see the sign  Yeah  I said it sounds like an Elvis song  McCutcheon myself  Ew  That's not even a joke  I know  That was a real dud  I'm turning red  It's supposed to be  McCutcheon my balls  McCutcheon my  I did the Elvis sound after  You did 
[02:14:00]  You should call the Elvis channel  They would love that song  Yeah  That's a story  That would be fucking prime time  They could run with  They would make that into a 20 minute segment  You did it to the tune of  I shook up  Yeah  I'm a touching  I'm a touching myself  Why did Elvis sing about touching it?  I don't know  I just thought it was funny and clever  Wordplay  Wordplay  It wasn't  Chip Norton  Can you tell me what the Elvis channel is doing today?

[02:15:00]  Where did you see that he was going to be playing Sam?  I don't know  It's just kind of out there  Because I bet  It's wrong?  It's wrong  I have nothing to base that on  But the fact that  Sometimes when people come in here  We do have erroneous information  I used to be a huge fan of Sam Kinison  Who wasn't, right?  And maybe we should play a little Sam Kinison  Into break there, E-Rock  I always thought that Gary Sinise should have played Sam Kinison  Really?  Too skinny  I was thinking his performance in Forrest Gump made me think that he could pull off Kinison 
[02:15:30]  With the long hair and the...  It made me...  Wow  It made me think that he could probably pull it off  I never saw that  My fat wife, Sam  Yeah  Sam Kinison  Titanium  I don't know why  But I always thought...  Move where the food is  We'll do it one trip  I know  Like the cameraman couldn't give him a sandwich?  I might have to change his voice  I don't know

[02:23:00]  What was it?  I think if it's the one that I'm thinking of  It's that Aussie band who has like that Disney Channel show  The Wiggles  They are terrific  Yeah  No we were talking about  I got laid at one of those shows  We were talking about Bruce Springsteen  I've never seen Springsteen live  And one of the all time great moments of my life  Was Springsteen came to see Book of Mormon  And he comes up to me after  And he goes  He goes  Man you've got a sick voice on you 
[02:23:30]  It's really weird but it's so cool  And I was like  That's by the way my Springsteen impression  Which I'm not very excited  It wasn't bad  Yeah it's just like  He's kind of on his deathbed  It's cool  Yeah yeah yeah  It was mellow Bruce  It was very mellow stone Bruce  But he um  No he was lovely  So I'm dying  So I think I just hooked myself up with tickets to Springsteen  If any of you guys want to go with me  I saw him a year ago  I saw Bruce for the first time  And I'm like why the fuck  At the Apollo Theater we saw him  And you guys saw him at the Apollo  I go why the fuck have I not seen Bruce before now 
[02:24:00]  I know I've never  He's amazing live  He's amazing  I'm not  I mean I'm a Springsteen fan  I'm not over the top huge but  He's a Cyndi Lauper of his generation  I'll say  Not quite that good  Not quite  But he's getting there  Cyndi Lauper still dresses like Cyndi Lauper too  I love Cyndi  And the girls just want to have fun here  Girls just want to have fun  I love it  I find it sexy  It's delightful  She wrote a musical that's pretty astounding  That's what people are saying  I gotta tell you man  People are saying 
[02:24:30]  People are talking on the Broadway circuit  About that show  It's really good  It's really good  What's it called  It is called Kinky Boots  I should get paid by the producer  For promoting a show that I'm not in  Yes you should  I was trying to get tickets for Kinky Boots  For my sister and niece  Really?  I could hook you up  I could hook you up  I know people  It's too late now  No it's never too late  Alright  It's never too late  Two tickets for today  It's too late  It's actually way too late  Well they asked me last minute too 
[02:25:00]  And they want to take us to your old play  How old is your niece?  Book of Mormon  She's in the business actually  She's in theaters  Okay so she's not like  She's 20, 21-ish  Oh I'm thinking like a six year old niece  No  No she's in the business  She's going to school for it and everything  That's amazing  Yeah she's doing alright too  Well I can get her tickets to that  I'm not in it anymore  She's from Florida  They're only here like today  I'm from Florida  Or part man  I'm from South Florida  I'm from Hollywood, Florida  Oh right by Fort Lauderdale  That's exactly  That's where the implant is  Technically in Hollywood  Yeah  It's at the R-Rock Cafe  That's where what's her name died  It's a great venue isn't it?  It is yeah 
[02:25:30]  I think we did this bit  What's her name died there?  Yes  That's what you guys are known for  And Marilyn Monroe  And Nicole Smith  Died in Hollywood  Tits McGillicuddy  Tits McGillicuddy  Tits McGillicuddy  Died  Too soon  Too soon  I know you're here to talk about jobs  But are you really playing Sam Kinison?  I really am playing Sam Kinison  Because you've got a lot of Sam Kinison fans in the studio  I know I do  I'm terrified about it  He's one of my favorites of all time  He's one of my favorites of all time  Really?  That's a big fucking like  Don't even get me started 
[02:26:00]  I know  I'm just saying it  I've already started drinking a lot of tea and honey  And taking throat lozenge  Yeah  Just the screaming alone is brutal  But no I'm really super terrified  Excited  My first experience was  My brother was a huge Kinison fan  Right  And so he shows me this movie when I'm like 10 years old  It's this Rodney Dangerfield film  And I'm looking at it  And it's really funny  And then all of a sudden  This force of nature comes on  And it's like the first time I realized  What a scene stealer was  Yeah  And I was like 
[02:26:30]  Who's this guy?  And then I started to watch his HBO specials  And I started to see  You know  All this stuff  And Wild Thing  And everything else  And then listened to his Stern stuff  And I was just like  This is a force of nature  It's a guy that kind of redefined comedy  You know  I think for a lot of comedians  And so it's terrifying to fill those shoes  That Dangerfield special was huge  Oh my god  It was just like  It was crazy  Everyone else that was on that one  Go fuck yourself  Who else was on his?  I mean I know on Dyson's 
[02:27:00]  There was a crazy one  And there were a few other people  That I think actually  Was Roseanne on the same one  Kinison was on?  She might have been  I think she finished off  I think you might be right  Yeah  And my favorite about that thing  Was that Rodney would warn people  About it  Like it always came  With a disclaimer  Yes  It was never just  You know  Hey  Here's another comic  It was always like  You gotta be prepared  For this guy  It's gonna fuck your mind  Boy that's some big shoes  To fill right there  Yeah thank you guys  Thanks for making me feel really  You know  You can take solace 
[02:27:30]  In the fact that  You just look at  What Michael Chiklis did  After the Belushi thing  That he did  Oh he didn't work for 10 years  Yeah  No that makes me feel  A lot better  Makes me feel a lot better  Commish  I uh  Yeah  That's good  Oh my god  That's great  I'm gonna have a 10 year respite  From acting  How are you preparing?  Uh  Are you doing stand up?  I'm not  I'm just gonna  Yeah  I'm gonna go do some stand up  I'm gonna  Larry Charles  Who is the director of Borat  And um  And the director  Of kind of  All of Sasha Cohen's stuff 
[02:28:00]  Is directing the movie  And he  Comes from that world  Um  So he's hooking me up  With a lot of  Wow  A lot of amazing  Are you gonna grow your hair out  Or are you gonna wear a wig?  I'm gonna try to grow my hair out  And then  Alright  Alright  And you know  I also just lost a ton of weight  For a movie  So I have to  Oh man  Put the weight back  It's gonna be an interesting ride  We're not filming  Probably for another  Six months to a year  Okay  So I've got time  But uh  It's gonna be a lot  Is this uh  Yeah  Script's great 
[02:28:30]  It's written by Rich Roach  And what uh  What does it cover  In Sam's like life?  I can't really talk about it right now  Because it's  You can  You're just not alone  Of course you can  You do have vocal cords  Don't you  Man  But it's uh  You can if you wanna be a pussy  But it's  It's gonna be  Yeah  Which I am  I've been called that a lot  In fact by my daughter  This morning  Uh  And no  It's gonna cover  A nice chunk of time  And it's gonna be  A great introduction  To people who didn't know Sam  Yeah  And it's gonna be  A great reminder  To people who did know him 
[02:29:00]  Are you gonna talk to people  Who knew him?  I am  I'm already sorry  I spoke to uh  Yeah  Alan Stevens  And um  You know  I already spoke to  Robin Williams  And and  It just kind of  Getting a feel  From like  All of his contemporaries  Of what it was like  I mean  There's stories about him  Walking into clubs  With like a loaded gun  And just like  You see some comics  Who were actually  Terrified of playing  Yeah yeah  In the same club as him  Because it was just  No shit  He was a force of nature  And he was dangerous  He was just a dangerous  Real life dangerous 
[02:29:30]  Not funny  No real life dangerous  This is right  So  Are you gonna take anal  Are you gonna take anal nitrate?  I am gonna take anal nitrate  Actually  I call it anal nitrate  I'm going to take anal nitrate  Anal nitrate  Okay  Again  And what about Carl Lebeau?  You gotta talk to him  I'm planning on talking to him  Yeah  That's very cool  There's a lot of work to be done  Jimmy Schubert  Remind me  Used to go with those guys  You gotta hook me up  With some of these guys  You know these guys  Yeah I know some of the guys  I only met him once  What was that like?  I was doing an open mic 
[02:30:00]  At Rascals  While he was headlining  The main room  And so Ward Magnuson  The guy who ran the club  Brought Sam out  To meet some of the  Younger comedians  And it was funny  Because he staggered out  Like he was too drunk  To talk  And we're like  Oh fuck  But then he was just  Fucking around  And he stood there  For about five minutes  And just  I don't even remember  What he said  I got him to sign a napkin  He was really nice  Sounds like a scene  For the movie Jim  Actually  What if that's the entire  What if the entire movie  Covers it from Jim's point of view  It's like that day  That Sam fucked him over  But signed a napkin  We talked for a little while 
[02:30:30]  Yeah  I think it's  We may have to do some rewrites  Five minutes of his life  Yeah  But yeah so I'm doing that  Stretched out to 90 minutes  I'm doing that  And then I'm playing  Steve Wozniak  And pretty much  I just want to  I just want to do  Kind of people  Who were important  In the 1980s  Right  There you go  I'm going to do  Like a collection of films  About guys  That's good  Alan Thicke  You're going to play Alan  Alan Thicke  Very important in the 80s  Yeah  Yes  Double threat  A singer and actor  It says here  Josh plays Steve Wozniak 
[02:31:00]  Comma in Jobs  And then it says later  He will portray Steve Wozniak  Alongside Ashley Kutcher  As Steve Jobs  In the biopic Jobs  Oh again  Yeah it's good to have it twice  Yeah I just want  They wanted you guys to know  In case you didn't read  The first bulletin  Yes  That I'm playing Steve Wozniak  A.k.a. the Woz  You're the godfather  Of Bryce Dallas Howard  No I'm not her godfather  Because we're the same age  I'm her children's godfather  Oh okay because  Of course that's wrong  Oh okay  And Seth Gabriel's son Theo 
[02:31:30]  Seth Gable yeah  Oh I'm sorry  Her husband and I  Have known each other  Since we were  Five years old  We've been best friends  And so  I've been fortunate enough  To know them  Let's be serious though  It's not hard to be best friends  At five  What do you got  A fucking matchbox car  You're my best friend  No we had a drug problem  That we both had to  Help each other get out  Okay that then  We uh  Anal nitrates  Anal nitrates  So dope  Yeah  Right 
[02:32:00]  You played Warren  On Bored to Death  Was that the boyfriend  Who came back  And was uh  She was fucking  Her ex-boyfriend  Yeah  Oh my god  Jimmy was in that  Yeah I was in  Probably in like  The next episode  Or whatever  Did you like  Did I leave an impression  I remember that  I was in a tank top  And I'm fucking her  Taking her from behind  In bed  As Schwartzman  Like is like  Really  Yes  I believe it was  We did a table read  There was three episodes  We read  And that was  You probably had to read  The same day I was 
[02:32:30]  Because you guys  Went through it before  I don't know how I know  That but I do  I think I read it  Yeah  I left an impression  You did  I'm very excited about this  Yeah Warren  It's a funny god damn scene  It was a good scene  But uh  The Waz  Now you're playing the Waz  I'm playing the Waz  Did you meet the Waz  No I didn't  I reached out to him  Steve Wozniak  Is consulting on  Another Jobs film  So  It was one of those  One where Brad Pitt  Is playing him  I hear  That's right  He's getting a little  Closer to that  A little too close  Yeah 
[02:33:00]  He demands that  Brad Pitt plays him  Jimmy  Is he  He's actually  Like legitimately  Can search  No I didn't get a chance  To meet him  But I adore him  I feel like  I've met him  Because god knows  I've done enough research  To figure out  His gait  His speaking pattern  And everything else  But he's an amazing guy  I mean  Isn't it just  Like the history  Of those guys  And what they did  On the level 
[02:33:30]  They did it  True entrepreneurship  And just having  An amazing idea  Like that  Not only having  An amazing idea  But like  To build that shit  In a garage  Right  And then to like  Just have the capacity  To make  What literally  Was a mom and pop shop  And turn it into  A billion dollar  Fortune 500 empire  Is crazy  And my knowledge  Of the legacy  Of jobs  And Apple in particular  Was everything  Kind of post iPod  That was kind of  My reference point  For it all  And I was very young 
[02:34:00]  When you know  The other stuff  Was happening  Most people  Only know  Yeah  And you forget  That he was fired  From Apple  A man who was  Synonymous with Apple  Was fired from the company  And then came back  Only years later  After he was at Next  Which to  Huge victory  Huge victory  Like he fucking  Came back  And changed  Changed everything  But that's the thing  It's one of the  Great redemption stories  Yeah yeah yeah  And it's not  And it's  It's never framed that way  It's always framed  The cult of jobs 
[02:34:30]  Is framed  As kind of this  Thing that existed  In this box  That was  You know  That  Everything that we now know  The iPod  The iPad  The revolution  Of music  And everything  That kind of  Came before that  Is in many ways  To my generation  At least  A forgotten footnote  There was some  Kind of a time  Where Apple  Was looked at  As more of the  Hippie-ish  Kind of  That's right  And artsy-fartsy  Thing  You remember  That little blue  The little blue  Egg kind of  Yeah yeah yeah 
[02:35:00]  That's kind of  I want that  On my desk man  I remember seeing that  And being like  What is that  It's a Mac  I'm like  I'd rather have  The square white tower  That runs windows  On my computer  On my desk  And stuff  And then  When he came back  And they started  Branching out into  Other things  Than just  And then only  Computing  You know  And phones and  What not  It just changed  Everything  Well that's what  It was for me  Is I remember  Somebody introducing  The iPod to me  And I realized  That this device  Could be fully  Integrated  With all of these  Other devices 
[02:35:30]  And it just  Created such  Simplicity and ease  For somebody  Who's not a techie  Like myself  And it was  It was amazing  Because I had  Always been a  Windows guy  And I was terrified  Of making that leap  And then my  My wife was like  You know  You gotta try  This Mac thing  And I've never  Gone back  I now have  Every Apple device  Available to man  Yeah it  It really is amazing  And there are  Two whole  Different things  With Jobs  Beginning  Before his  Return  What was the  Crossover  That made it  Mainstream  What was the  Thing 
[02:36:00]  The iPod  That was huge  But you were right  Only really hip  People got the Mac  What was the  Cross where it  Finally went  Okay now it's  Mainstream  I'll tell you  Exactly when it  Was  I remember  Coming to LA  In like 2003  After college  And seeing this  Giant billboard  Of a silhouette  Dancing on  Sunset Boulevard  And I remember  Going what the  Hell is that  Thing  And that's  When I realized  That it had  Become something  Else  That it had  Become this  Pop culturally  Relevant thing 
[02:36:30]  That it had  Otherwise been  A very niche  Marketplace  If you remember  Before the iPods  Discman  You still walked  Around with a  Physically moving  Motorized thing  On your arm  With your  Idiots  You do don't you  Yeah you change  Disc to the  Audio cassette one  You actually have  A portable record  Player that you  Walk around  With  I had a  Discman  That's all you have  He literally only  Plays in your eyes  On a boombox  Walking down the street  Every day  Holding it over his  Head trying to  Find love  Double cassette  As long as you 
[02:37:00]  Didn't move  The Discman  Worked perfectly  As long as you  Didn't fucking  Move a muscle  Your music collection  Had to physically  Be carried with you  Either cassettes  Or discs  Or what not  And when you  Finally really  Thought about  This little  Fucking thing  Is holding so  Many songs  Instantly accessible  You're not changing  Things  It changed the game  How many songs  Was the first  Two  It was two songs  It was two songs  A and B  And they were  A and B  No the thing was 
[02:37:30]  Is that I remember  Even getting an  Early generation  MP3 player  And being like  I wanted to  I wanted to like it  But I could never  Wrap my head around it  I'm like it's too complicated  Very complicated  To get songs on it  To use it  It wasn't  The interface  Wasn't very friendly  Or anything  They really figured it out  And it was  Thank you  You really figured  Oh wait a minute  Thank you  I appreciate that  You play the guy  Wow  I don't think  Woz had much to do  With the iPod  How much  When did Woz 
[02:38:00]  Like kind of  Break off from that  Whole thing  And what were the  Circumstances  We don't really  Show this part  In the film  But Steve Wozniak  Was in a plane crash  In the early 80s  And really severe  He was flying the plane  And he  He suffered  Like memory loss  Jesus  For about a month  And it kind of  Changed him  Completely  In a way  That he stepped  Away from Apple  And he decided  That he wanted  To pursue  More kind of  Personal goals  Like teaching  And he did 
[02:38:30]  That music festival  That people forgot about  That was like  Oh remember that thing  That's right  He did this crazy  Music festival  Twice actually  And so he  Started to go off  On his own  He developed  One of the first  Universal remotes  And like that's  He just kind of  Went after his own  Niche in life  How much of that  Apple cash  Did he wind up  Skating away with  Not as much  As you would think  He was a  He's a very  Generous person  So he gave away 
[02:39:00]  A lot of his  Money to people  Who worked on the  Team with him  Who were otherwise  Kind of left in the  Dust  And that's kind of  One of the other  Unsung heroic  Things that he did  That people don't  Really know  Well Steve Jobs  Meanwhile just  Kept every penny  And I hear  Kicked homeless people  Yep  As he was walking  Down the street  I heard that he  Kicked marsupials  He went to  He went down  Under and he  Hurt marsupials  Because they're  One of the  Cutest species  But I had never  Heard about the  Homeless people  That hurts  That bothers me 
[02:39:30]  Terrible  Marsupials  Yeah  That really bothers me  Wow  That's  And as far as  As far as  Casting goes  Yeah  A lot of people  Thought it was  Kind of a weird  Choice  Well then they're  Dicks aren't they  Well yeah  But like  Ashton  No by people  We mean Ashton  Kutcher  He didn't like it  You know  Ashton is  Fucking uncanny  I mean if you  Hold up a picture  Of young Steve Jobs  To a regular picture  Of Ashton Kutcher 
[02:40:00]  Before he's even  In makeup  It's pretty creepy  How similar  They are  No one ever thought  That until it was  Done  Until it was done  In fact I don't know  That you can find  Somebody in Hollywood  That looks as much  Like Steve Jobs  So it kind of  Yes it was kind of  Like  Oh well it's  The guy from  Two and a half men  But at the same time  It's kind of  A genius move  Because people  Don't expect it  And having seen  The film three times  Now I can tell you  That he does  An astounding job  In it  He's really remarkable  But he also  Just physically  Resembles the man  In a way  That's really cool 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  And you know  He's an A-lister  He's an A-lister  He's making a lot  More money than  The four of us  Combined  Oh man  You'd be surprised  What my salary is  Your salary  Couldn't trip out  That's arguably  The best  Cunty wife line  In the history of television  That really is good  Alice I don't want  My salary to leak out  Your salary  Couldn't drip out  Fucking what a  Lightning strike  That was  It really was genius  So when are people 
[02:41:00]  Going to be able  To see this  August 16th  August 16th  Yes  A week from tomorrow  A week from tomorrow  A week out  It's a great movie  It's really inspirational  And I think people  Are going to  Really enjoy it  And this leads up  To how far  In Mr. Job's life  There  It leads up  To his bar mitzvah  It's  A lot of people  Don't even know  That he was Jewish  Early on  No it leads up  To the launch  Of the iPod  Oh okay  You say iPad  Very funny 
[02:41:30]  iPod  Okay  That's a British way  Of saying iPad  Teasing of course sir  iPod  So yeah  And then I got  A film coming out  In September  Called thanks for sharing  With Mark Ruffalo  Gwyneth Paltrow  And Tim Robbins  That is also really  Amazing  What's that about  Sex addiction  Ah  Oh really  And look right  At Jimmy Norton  Cause I saw him  Get a little twinkle  In his eye  When I said it  I wasn't  Consulting on this film  You should have been  You should have been  You should have been  You pulled a waz on us 
[02:42:00]  You're consulting  On another sex addiction  Yes I am  On a competing  Sex addiction film  And then I'm doing  A movie with Kevin Hart  Oh cool  Now you're just bragging  I am  And then I'm  And then I'm gonna  Go away to Costa Rica  And buy a home  What are you doing  We're gonna wing on over  To London  And jam with the stones  Doing a movie with Kevin  Called Golden Tux  Which is basically  My guy is this guy  Who's about to get married  And his fiance  Wants him to have  As many groomsmen 
[02:42:30]  As she has bridesmaids  And he has no friends  So he has to hire  A consulting firm  Called Best Man Incorporated  That Kevin Hart runs  To basically hire  All my groomsmen  To pretend to be my friends  It's gonna be really genius  And the script  Is one of the funniest scripts  I've ever read  Rom-com  Rom-com  It's a rom-com  A romantic comedy  You're gonna be  Pretty much lead guy  In a rom-com  I am  Hence this staggering  Weight loss  That is pretty cool  They don't let fat people  Have love stories  I found out  I found out the hard way 
[02:43:00]  Unless at the end  Gwyneth Paltrow  Makes the speech  About how beauty  Is only skin deep  That's right  They couldn't even give  The fucking fat lady  In the movie  The speech that meant something  In shallow hell  It should be shallow Hollywood  They had to give it  To the beautiful person  It's amazing  That industry  They were too scared  That said  I would much rather hear  It from Gwyneth Paltrow  So I realized  I would have to sell  Shut up fatty  And throw oats at her  How much weight  Did you lose?  I lost 30 pounds  I actually had to lose it 
[02:43:30]  For the Zach Braff movie  That I'm working on now too  So it was just kind of  And then I've got to  Put it all back on  For Kinnison  So it's great  Oh my god  My heart is like  This is fucked up life  You're living this  It's like make a decision  Yeah it's make a decision  Exactly  You do a lot of  Fucking film work man  Book of Mormon was good to you  Book of Mormon was great to me boys  That was the launching pin  Remember when you guys were like  You're going to fucking fail  And I said to you  No I'm not  I'm not  Trust me  And look at me now  This is the third time  You've had me on  Something's going right  Bitch  He's just come back here  To gloat  We still talk about 
[02:44:00]  Book of Mormon  We were just going away by that  Let's sing a song together  From the show  I'd love to  How many generations  Are they in now?  How many generations?  Meaning it was you  Then someone took over for you  Has someone now taken over  For that guy?  Yes  They're on like  Their sixth version of me  I think  Wow  They've gone through quite a few  But Nikki is still there  Who played an album  Nikki St. James right?

Rory's actually doing  A show right now  At second stage  And then he's getting ready  To do an adaptation  Also at second stage  Of Little Miss Sunshine 
[02:45:00]  Where he's playing  The  What's it called?  Roll  Steve Carell  Steve Carell  Thank you  I just picked one of them  Yeah that was really good actually  It could have gone wrong  It can't be the  Alan Arkin part  Could have been the little girl  Could have been the little girl  Of course  Yeah  Could have been the little girl  How bad would you feel  If Bruce Springsteen  Went to every single person  That played your part  And told them  What a great voice he had  He just keeps going  Hey man  You got a great voice 
[02:45:30]  He actually says that  After every Broadway show  He literally went to  Phantom of the Opera  Last week  And he was like  Hey man  You got a sick voice  He said that to  Michael Crawford  Back in 1988  That's his addiction  He has to go backstage  To every Broadway show  You catch him off  Every time he goes backstage  You got a sick voice  Hey man  Did you have  Did you have  Hey man  Did you have  Book of Mormon  Nightmares  Did you  I had a Book of Mormon  Nightmare on stage  Once when I literally  Forgot my line  You told us  I shit you not 
[02:46:00]  And it took me a minute  Of just pure silence  And I literally  Finally said  What the fuck is my line  In front of a live audience  It was so bad  Wow  That I couldn't hear them  Saying the line  It was a nightmare  You were just panicking  It wasn't even panic  It was like seeing  The white light  And like no English words  Were coming to me  Like I've gone up  On lines before  And you just improv  Your way out of it  But there was an actor  Who will remain nameless  Fucking like texting  And rolling his eyes 
[02:46:30]  In the front  He's greedy  And lazy  What was that about  Stallone and Willis  Come on guys  You gotta put this  Behind you  We need an  Expendables 3  With the 2  We need it with 4  Harrison Ford  That's all you need to know  In the museum  I hope at some point  He goes  I got a bad feeling  About this  I got a bad feeling  About this  My favorite  I'm sorry  There was an actor  Up front texting  And that distracted me  And that distracted me  And fucking angered me  Good for you  What an asshole  It's good for me  So I went up on my lines  And gave him more reason 
[02:47:00]  To hate the show  Yeah boy  You sure showed him  Did he hate it  He could have hated the show  Yeah he was a douchebag  He did hate the show  I gotta know who this is  I'll tell you guys  When the mics are off  And then we'll tell you people  No  We don't do that ever  I'm kidding  It was really fucked up  By the way  Do you know what I was thinking  I'm sorry  I listened to it the other day  Again it made me laugh  Was that fucking  The song  I sleep now little boy  And then when you do  The overly dramatic  I don't remember  Sleep now  He's like  Evening star  Shines brightly 
[02:47:30]  It was so  It just  I didn't have to make  Trey and Matt laugh  One day  That's the best shit  Is like when you just  Are trying to make  Trey and Matt laugh  And then somehow  It's made it's way  Into it's sixth  Incarnation of the show  Where people are like  Doing this thing  That I did as an inside joke  In a rehearsal  It's fucking surreal  That's pretty cool  But my favorite  Going back  My favorite Harrison Ford  Line reading of all time  Indiana Jones  Temple of Doom  He's talking to  Cape Capshaw  And he's inside  That little cave  And he looks at 
[02:48:00]  Trudy and goes  We are going to die  My favorite Harrison Ford  Line reading of all time  And then the fucking  Ceiling's coming down  The spikes are coming out  It's so good  Who's underrated  Isn't it  Which one  Temple of Doom  I liked Temple of Doom  A lot  I love it  I thought that one  Ripping out the heart  Oh yeah  You ever see  Romance in the Stone  Guy that has nothing to add  So he picks a similar  Genre movie  To make himself  Involve in the conversation  Josh has to go 
[02:48:30]  Hey Battlestar Galactica  Oh yes  He's promoting  Jobs  Jobs  Jobs for the Obama  Administration  Not the movie  I'm just promoting jobs  And jobs  Jobs on jobs  Yes  Can we hear you do  Kinison or is that  Not yet  But soon  I will launch  Into the Scream on your show  When the time is right  There is the Scream  And I'm going to call you  Brother  I really want to talk to you  You're on my  You're on my to-do list  Okay sure  I used to do a  Kinison impression  For Howard  Let's hear it  I would  But it wasn't the  Screamy one  It was the one 
[02:49:00]  I would call him  On the phone  And be like  Hey buddy  How you doing man  Yeah hanging out  And it would be like  You know  Kind of go back and forth  But the Scream thing  Is just too much  Yeah  Do you know who does that well?  Craig Gass  Craig Gass  Do you know Craig?  Yes  I've actually  That son of a bitch  Does a good Kinison man  Yeah he does  In fact I've been looking at it  Yeah he's revealing  Stealing some shit  It's sometimes a lot easier  To get an impression  Watching someone doing an impression  Than just to watch the real guy  Because you actually  You understand an into it  That you wouldn't have thought about 
[02:49:30]  Yeah  Yeah that little quirky thing  Or something  It's like  And it's a little bit overdone maybe  Yeah  And he's got a complicated  Because he's from Oklahoma too  So he's got a little twang  In his voice  Yeah yeah  And the son of a preacher  So he's got that thing going  Yeah yeah  It's really  I'm going to fail  I think I'm going to fail  The more I think about it  The more I'm like  I'm destined to fail  There's a buzz out there  Michael Chiklis  Of my generation  Michael Chiklis  There's a buzz out there  About you playing Sam Kinison  You feeling good about your Sam though  When you're practicing it  Practicing it in the show 
[02:50:00]  I am  I am  Are you worried?  No  I can't wait to  No I'm a huge Kinison fan  I can't wait  I know  We're fans of yours  All kidding aside  I'm not going to do it  We're looking forward to this  Unless I know I can fucking kill it  I can't wait to go to the movies  That my arm is folded  And go  Oh Sam wouldn't have done it  With that we got to get  Josh Gad out of here  On the 16th  Yes  It's in theaters  A job  Week from Friday  Yes  And you're Josh Gad on Twitter  Is that 1A or 2  I always spell your name wrong  1A  You dick  It is G-A-D  Man  What the fuck

[02:51:00]  Sirius XSM  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show  Do I have something  What we're back on  Oh sorry  Hi everyone  Back on  I thought it was  30 seconds to me  Doing a little soliloquy  About perhaps  Steven Singer Jewelers  Or  My Pillow  Or  Iraq fucked us 
[02:51:30]  Go to Meeting by Citrix  Iraq fucked us  Yeah  Yeah  Because all he had to do  Was play like a Sam Kinison bit  It would have made sense  After the Josh Gad interview  Next thing you know  Oh wow  Look at the time  Of course  It's 10 o'clock  We gotta go home  Come back  Jimmy plugs  But now we gotta like  Kind of just make shit up  Here it is  I'll do the stretch thing  This is stretching now  Oh  That was nice  Jimmy's going to see  The Gigolos  Well he's  No not  The Gigolo  The Gigolo  American Gigolo  Right  To have it

[02:52:30]  Next week  No  Is this a bad idea  I don't know  Sounds like a  Is this a bad idea  Tell me  Well he's around  There will come a day  Like we have to pass away  He's great on our show  And he's a great singer  That's a bad idea  He didn't get kicked off K-Rock  For being too good  Life goes on  Yeah  I mean  If you ask him  It was because his ratings  Started increasing  And Tom Chiasano didn't  But that's not true  It got too good  Yeah that's not true 
[02:53:00]  New York wasn't ready  For David Lee Roth  That's all  New York the country  Oh yeah they gave him  A lot of markets  You know what you told me  Yeah  I know David Lee Roth  Is a friend now  We love David Lee Roth  What I said this  Yeah what you said to me  Allegedly  If you get this wrong  I'll sue the fuck out of you  So go ahead Sam Roberts  And your fucking chinos  Because I was a young man  Alright  Oh no  And you were giving me advice  Okay  And I was like  Oh I better pay attention to this  Okay  It was David Lee Roth's  First day on the air

A sickening bath  A sickening bath  Based on  Oh see  What we heard of the show  We did  I remember we had a listening party  Before our show  Yeah  Because it was going on for the first time  Okay  Okay  Okay  So I mean  I got excited  Because I knew it was a matter of time  Before they called us  Yeah  Although it would be ironic 
[02:54:30]  To have him now coming in  And filling in  I would love it  Wow  I think it'd be fun  Yeah  No matter  We should do guest hosts  I think there's a few people  That would fill in for us  Guess who else  Guess hosts  Who else would we get?  Who would do it actually?  No that's true  Who would do it?  David Lee Roth  Oh Danny would do it  So you'd have David Lee Roth  Denny and  Is Denny going to be part of Jocktober  Like the voice of Jocktober or something?  Or a consultant?  Wow  That could be good  Huh?  What happened?  He should be featured on Jocktober 
[02:55:00]  Every day  Oh no  Oh boy  Well most of us are fans of Denny in this room  You like that  Are you right?  No  No  I threw his hand in the trash  And he called me a son of a bitch  Wow  He threw his hand in the trash?

[02:56:30]  What happens when you're struggling on the radio?  What do you do Dennis Falcone?  Play a song  Oh well  We were playing a little bit of David Lee Roth  Sirius XM sticker on his binder too  It made me physically ill  Because he's a company guy  Well I'm showing you  I remember last week we had touched on the  You know the channel listing  Yes in the plastic  Because you were talking about the Elvis channel  Yes  Before and what they're doing on Elvis  Uh huh  Did I do a good job  Yeah  Because now I'm a company guy  And they were opening up the gates of Graceland  At 9 o'clock  Yeah what do they do to open up the gates of Graceland 
[02:57:00]  Open the gates  That's what they say on the radio?  Yeah  Because a new Elvis album just came out  What?  That's impossible he's dead  For all the stuff that he did  He passed away  You know all the recordings that he did for Stacks record  You know the  I love how the artist  Hold on Dennis  Because now it's a real thing  I love how the artist decided  You know what?  Decided you know what?  This shit isn't that good  It's not good enough  So I'm going to put it in my fucking attic  And no one will ever see this  And then you get these greedy motherfuckers  After you die  Start digging through your shit  And throw it out there 
[02:57:30]  Yeah  Elvis doesn't want that stuff out there  No these were recordings that  You know he did in those studios  Stacks studios  Have you got my touch in myself?  Like Promise Land  You know the Chuck Berry song  That he had a hit with  All day  A lot of good Elvis stuff  I mean why was it released before now?  No it was  And then there's a lot of stuff that wasn't  That was in the vaults  Yeah  Keep it in the vaults  By the way you know what they just found in the vaults?  What?  A fucking new  An Orson Welles film  That he did  I think right before Citizen Kane 
[02:58:00]  Or right after Citizen Kane  Yeah  Which was  I don't know what it's called  Yeah  But he didn't want it out there  He put it in a vault  No who knows  Maybe they locked it  I don't know why  Alright  It's a move  Maybe he thought he lost it  So you guys on vacation next week?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah  Ah  People would Josh with us  And say we're on vacation every week  Ah you know  Are you going to have some guest DJs in?  We were thinking of it  We want to  Remember when Imus used to bring in people like that years ago  I brought in Tom Carvel  Yeah  To do the show  Tom Carvel  Tom Carvel he brought in 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  Really?  Yeah he did  How was it?  Fun you  Tom Carvel  Every Wednesday  It's Sunday at Carvel  And now they have tinny thin  For your fatty fat friends  He used to say that  Can you find one of those commercials  Sam that you don't remember?

Yeah  No  Hey we'll be back on Monday  Don't forget  See that's what  You have to take advantage of it 
[02:59:00]  Actually you won't be hearing any production here for a month  You're doing it  So that's pretty much where we're at  Sal was doing a nice job on some work  He called me as a listen to  What?  Don't make the panda angry?  No he was doing some new production  We played don't play  I was trying to explain to Jackie the other day  What don't make the panda angry is  Yeah  You should never heard Sal's production  Having a little chit chat with Jackie  I sure was  Were you talking about the one in your pants?  No I would have said worm  I would have said don't make the worm vomit  This is it for you and Jackie right now huh? 
[02:59:30]  Yes we've had a falling out  Because you're not going to be in tomorrow  Oh  And Jackie  Our lovely intern Jackie is leaving  She's leaving  Yes  It's her last day tomorrow  It is her last day  Jackie  Hey don't share this microphone  Why are you crying?  She looks so festive today  You're crying  But yeah but I'm going to miss her  Look at her eyes  She was crying  No I wasn't  I know  Jackie's chit doesn't give a shit  I'm going to be sad  Never to hear spinach again  I know  We might hear it again though  She looks very festive today  Floral little shirt  And her red feather earrings 
[03:00:00]  This might be a double though  No  The bottom part might be a double  Oh yeah the skirt  I'm paying attention  I never match them  Alright  Fair enough  No never  Or she can dress nicely  Sure  Of course she can  I told you you looked handsome today  Thank you Jackie  I did  Handsome  Handsome  Thank you  You really told me what you looked handsome  I missed that accent  Oh it rules  It is kind of enjoyable  And I typically hate a buffalo accent  But the Rochester one is kind of cute  And it's pleasant to listen to  I don't know who it's coming out of  Let's be honest here 
[03:00:30]  That's a good point  If you were 450  I would hate that you said Sale  Sale  I had to do a promo  And Sale made me say his name at the end  Like so I got my Rochester accent  And it sounds awful  I forgot about that part too  You got to throw your jaw out there  Rochester  Rochester  You got to throw the top of your jaw  Say Rochester  Rochester  No  Say it properly  She can't do it right now  Come on  Just say I'm from Rochester  I'm from Rochester 
[03:01:00]  Rochester  Now you're making me laugh  Yeah  I heard your mom might be coming in tomorrow  She wants to  Yeah  I'm nervous  Why?  Yeah a little bit  You don't really want to bring her  How old is she going to do something for Britney Spears tickets?  She's 50  What?  But she doesn't look it  Her mom's 50  Oh that's cute  Oh god  The Ops had put up numbers back then  I don't know her right?  No  Oh my god  No  Imagine that  You find out  I don't think you were ever in the same place  You're Jackie's dad 
[03:01:30]  Oh my god  Oh that would be cute  Wait what did you say?  What did you say?  I don't think you guys ever lived in like the same place  She was from the Adirondacks  Oh okay  So she was never really  Okay  Okay  Okay  Okay  Okay  Okay  Wow  Don't Make the Panda Angry  It was about Roland when he got mad  So Sal put production together  And how long did we ridicule him over that for?  We still do  It's really  It was quick  It was probably a 45 minute  It's so bad  Just pounding of him  You should know horrible production at this point 
[03:02:00]  You know  And it's terrible  It's way over  It's too simple for what it is  But he went overboard on the way he says it  Well let her hear it  Yeah  Give it a listen  Let's see if she learned a thing or two  It's about Roland  This is your final  Hold on  This is your final exam right here  We want to see if you learned anything  Sal  Go ahead  Sal  Don't get the panda angry  Okay 
[03:02:30]  Okay  Your final exam  What do you got on that?  Why isn't Roland in it?  Yeah  Roland isn't in it  Or a panda  Or a panda  It's a lion  It is a lion  Isn't it?  But it's a cool roar  Yeah  For a lion  Imagine if he said  Don't make the bird chirp  And that sound happened  You'd be like  The voice isn't strong enough  The voice is not strong enough  The pandas don't roar  Pandas don't roar 
[03:03:00]  You're right  They don't  They growl  It's a weak voice  That he tried to pump up  With the production  It's thin  And ladylike  And feminine  And fruity  And gay  And  Jackie's looking around the room  So confused  As to what she just heard  I know  What is that?  Does that exist?  Yeah  She can work here  The pandas room  Sal came running in  Of course she can  Sal  What did you do?  All eager beaver  Didn't we do this already?  Yes  And thought  And thought  Three hours  Finally  Here's  And Sal thought  This way 
[03:03:30]  Here was Sal's thought process  Here's how people make it  In this business  And make a name for themselves  They see an opportunity  And go for it  They take the bull by the horns  Yes  And make a sound effect of a lion  They take  Well a man takes them by the hips  And Roland was angry  And the angry panda  We called him  And he's like  I got it  I'm going to put this piece of production together  He made it  And just  It sucked  So it worked in the opposite way 
[03:04:00]  Didn't you at one point say  It's the single worst piece of production  In the history of the show?  The single worst piece of production  Wow  Should we listen to it again?  Ever  I think in the history of the medium of radio  Yes  It's the worst  Yes  Now knowing all this  Listen to it one more time  Don't get the panda angry  Why the explosion?  It's terrible  What's the explosion? 
[03:04:30]  The door slamming  People leave  Waiting for something to follow  Right  It's nothing  It was just nothing there  Nothing  Terrible  Did it follow a clip though  Of Roland getting angry?  No  No  No  I can't picture Roland getting angry  By the way  That was supposed to be our go-to clip  When Roland was a little pissed off about something  We were going to be like  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  And then it was going to be on our sound machines  You know  Play it  It's going to be like a thing  Yeah  Everybody's going to go  Oh  And appearances are going to go 
[03:05:00]  Oh don't get the panda anger  Like a catchphrase  Yeah  Sal had all this in his head  Like all this was going to happen  Yeah  It was the single worst piece of production ever  Yeah  It's the thing you want to play  When you think of vinegar and water  In a bottle hanging in the bathroom  It just sounds like  Because he's a douche  Denny  What did you think of the VO on it?  That's your expertise  Exactly  You're good at the VO  You or I should have done it  Doesn't it sound like somebody  That couldn't really hit the mark  And tried to pump it up in post 
[03:05:30]  It was a good idea  But there was no follow through  No follow through  Denny  How would you say  Don't get the panda angry?  Don't get that panda angry  Oh I like that  I like that  Sort of like a Disney type  Yes  It was festive  Of course  Because you don't work blue  Just want to have a little fun  No edge whatsoever  I just want to have a little fun  Yeah  I leave the edge to you guys  Oh thank you  Very good  By the way  The edge 52 years old today  The edge from you too  How'd you like that?  Did I do that?  Very good  I like that 
[03:06:00]  Thanks  You can hear you too  On the 80s channel  And the 90s channel  And the alternate rock channels too  Sure  Sure  Maybe a little lithium  There you go  A lithium  Yes  We've got a lot of rock channels for you  Even deep tracks  Maybe a little deep tracks  Maybe classic rewind  Classic rewind  Classic rewind would play  Where the streets have no time  Danny said you had your sheet  You could refer to it  Like we're unprepared  What else is in your binder of shit?  I wear it over my head  When I refer to it  You know 
[03:06:30]  Promos that I might need to reference  On the show  Wait look at this binder of shit  I know  Binder of shit  Promos that I might need to reference  You know  Yeah  Why would you have promos covered in plastic?  Well just so I have them here  Do you have a little card box for your liners?  Liner cards  Yeah  Rotate the cards  You know  Making sure I press all the right buttons  Phone numbers  Of the other DJs on the channel  Jackie  Just a lot of things  Nice pictures of the Beatles  The Beatles  What?  Why do you have pictures of the Beatles  In your binder of shit? 
[03:07:00]  I like them  Because he doesn't want it to be a thin binder  So he has to fluff it up  Right  It's filler  It's exactly what he is right now  Jackie  You like that Jimmy Buffett one?  We like to give the interns advice  Jimmy Buffett  Is your almost last day  Yeah  Don't be that guy  Yeah you don't want to be this guy  That's all you need to know  I don't care  That's what you learned today  I don't care that much  To put it in sleeves  Yeah  Yeah let's say you're on to something  God Jack  Jack  He has a binder of shit  I didn't even know  What we were going to talk about today  That's the truth  Yeah  That's why I made up that Connecticut shit 
[03:07:30]  Connected  We talked about Bing Crosby and Judy Garland  Because I didn't know what the fuck  We were going to talk about today  Connecticut  You know the Connecticut song there Dennis?  I'm not aware of that one  It's on the 40s channel  Oh  They play it  It's hideous  Bing Crosby  I was winking while I called you shit by the way  So relax a little bit  I know  Yes  My vigorous nodding was a joke also  He's got an inspiration board in his binder  Well that's nice  What's on the inspiration board?  Just certain things that we have to make sure we cover  Keeping the content fresh 
[03:08:00]  And being authentic on the air  And just a lot of good points  This is not real  I think I'm out of the bit  This is not real  Now you're making up shit  Being authentic on the air  What else is on there?  Let me see that  Show Anthony  Just being prepared  Timely and topical  Just being prepared for your show  Let me see it  There you go  Thank you sir  Show pre-prepared  Okay  Prepare for every break before your show  Focus on you, the listener  Not I, yourself  Content fresh  Never take prep material and repeat it verbatim 
[03:08:30]  Take relevant parts and create something new  That's good  Conversational delivery  Be natural  Speak as a friend to the listener  Avoid all DJ cliches  Could you give us an example of that?  How you speak as a friend?  Well you know  Ant just referred that the Edge is celebrating a birthday today  You know maybe when you were in college  And you heard about these new guys  You two coming over from Ireland  And they were really making some noise over there  And this is maybe one of the first songs that you heard  Ah, you, you, you 
[03:09:00]  A lot of you's in there  Instead of just saying  And today is  You know just work it into the conversation  Make it like you're talking to a friend  In his living room  Or a bathhouse  Or through a glory hole  Exactly  Be passionate  Express true passion and enthusiasm for the music  Yeah  You gotta believe in the music  Oh I love this one  Let's crank it up louder  It's you two  Rock it on the 80s  You know something like that  Exactly  That sounds passionate  Sounds like a friend  Yeah and friendly  That's just how my friends and I talk 
[03:09:30]  Breaks brief  Use the fewest words to convey the most information  Again  The company telling you  What you say on the air isn't worth shit  Right  No no no no  The more you talk the worse it is  It's because people  You know don't have a long attention span  So you want to make sure you're saying the right things  Engage  What do you say  Entertain with creative brevity  Brevity  Alright  Timely and topical  Be in the moment  Sound live and unpredictable  Unpredictable  Unpredictable 
[03:10:00]  Could you give us an example of something live and unpredictable  Please  Well live and unpredictable  Yeah  You need a song or you  No no no  Okay  It's like a lot of DJs say  Hey it's good to have you along on a Thursday  Most people know it's a Thursday  Sure  You don't have to  You know  Work it during the weekend  Things like that  Yeah  Hey enjoy the weekend  Good to have you along  Maybe you're headed out to the beach or the park  Take us home for the ride  That's unpredictable  That's unpredictable  Wow  Hey you know coming up  Here's what's unpredictable  Hey it's going to be sunny today  You're going to go to the beach  Just avoid those filthy Jews  Alright  Here's the stones 
[03:10:30]  That's unpredictable  Coming up got something from Elvis  Something that you might hear from one of his albums  That he recorded back in the 60s  A movie cut or something like that  What the fuck is this though  It says convey time of day  Day of week  And time of year  Broadcasting to fucking coma  Coma survivors  What year is it  Yeah why do you have to broadcast the day of the week  And time of year  Time of year  Yeah  That's what it says  Like a season  Yeah  Oh okay  Hey  It's five o'clock here in autumn 
[03:11:00]  Autumn  Make sure people are enjoying their summers  Right  There you go  Right  Consistency  Make every break count  No throw away breaks  Like this one  Yeah  That's the bad fucking 20 minutes up  You're going to ruin it  Say something of benefit to the listener every break  Yes  Okay  That's sound advice  Absolutely  Great  Does he have an example of that one?  What would be  Beneficial  Yeah  Beneficial  Beneficial  Let's see  You just had Josh Gad in the studio 
[03:11:30]  And he's  We already forgot we had him in  You were cross promoting something like  By the way  There's a new movie coming out with Sam Kinison  You might remember that movie that Sam was in  Back to school  And you know with Rodney Dangerfield  And here's one from that year  Here's a song you might have heard on the radio  Oh that's beneficial to the listener  Turn it in there  How is that beneficial to the listener?  It's just a cheesy tie-in  No because I promoted the fact that  Wow this guy Josh Gad is going to be in a new movie  About the life of Sam Kinison  Beneficial to the listener would be  Hey don't eat graham crackers  They give you testicular cancer  Because I told you that's what it's going to be 
[03:12:00]  And I'm the voice of authority  Being the disc jockey on the radio  The voice of authority  Nice  You never say like  I like that  I think this is from magical mystery  I'm the voice of authority  Never say that  You are the voice of authority  Never say it  Cross promoting  Once per hour  Communicate a liner  Or hot list highlight  In your own words  Don't read them  I don't mean to pick  But I never hear you guys promote  That Sam is coming up with the  You know  Thank you  Yeah  People just know  By the way  Sam's got so and so coming in 
[03:12:30]  To join him  That'll be on the radio  Oh no  We never know  Because he steals the good guest  And puts him on his show  Exactly  He can't  And goes  Oh I didn't know you wanted him  No he's a wonderful conversationalist  I'd rather promote a strained bowel movement  A little nugget  Popping on  Liners separated from promos  Uh oh  Shore breaks with liners  Are not sequenced near  Or recorded  Or recorded promo  That's very technical  That sounds like very technical  Well you're not supposed to be  Reading it to the listener  That's why it's  Yeah yeah yeah 
[03:13:00]  Those are tricks of the trade  Tricks of the trade  Don't read the tricks of the trade  To the listeners  And of course  Trimmed and timed  All breaks  Have been trimmed correctly  And timed out properly  That would lead the listener  To believe they're all recorded  No no  Trimming your break  I edit myself all the time  When I'm doing a break  If I'm talking  You know  And I don't want to do that  Because I'm not just  How about you really edit yourself  And get the fuck out of here  Uh I think I missed one  Oh you did  Yes  Oh I'm sorry  I was winking  I'm good  Wait what was that one I missed 
[03:13:30]  Put toe on trigger  Place barrel  In back of pallet  Authentic I guess  Listeners must believe in you  You're the expert  But how do you do that  Be in the mindset  Of the target listener  Fuck  Who's the target listener  For our show  On your show  You should be in the target  Of the mindset listener  Men anywhere from 18 to 54  And our listeners  So we have to be in the mindset  Of the target listener  Yes  Which is  You didn't do anything wrong 
[03:14:00]  She was asking for it  Yeah  So our target listener  Has balls  Is what you're saying  Give that back  18 to 54  That's like three generations  What's that Denny  That next paper  Yeah  That's a little too wide  We're not talking  18 year olds anymore  Yeah I don't think  There's any 18 year olds  That passes by  I would say 10 years ago  Yeah  Well they might be  Listening in the car  With their dad  Well fuck those people  And now I think  And now I think  With the addition  Of the likes  Of Jackie and Sidney  They can relate  To the young interns 
[03:14:30]  That have brought in  What  I think they helped the show  That's right  I've been here for eight years  Huh  I'm young  What  They're not young  They're not young  They're not young  They're not young  Welcome  Welcome  Exactly  You dress like the fucking  Housewares manager  At Pergament  That is terrible  Denny  Anything else  Pergament  They're out of business  Yeah I was just  A quick reference  That's why it's great  There you go  That was a great reference  I was  I was saying  I want to get  The picture that I took  Of Sidney and Jackie 
[03:15:00]  And me  And blow it up  And put it in a frame  Right behind me  Sure  So that in the future  They live on  Interns  I could go  Here's the bar  Guys  Here's the fucking bar  Can we get that picture  It's now been set  Are you going to take  A picture with Tyler  What the fuck  Oh that guy  No no  There's no need to  When's his last day  The bar is  When is his last day  He's a good guy  He's a good broadcaster  Is he  He's not done until the week  After you guys get back  So you have him all to yourselves  Glad that you guys are gone  And Jesus  We have Tyler  How did that work out 
[03:15:30]  That's just stupid  It's terrible  That is stupid planning  Not good planning on our part  Next time  No guy  We get three  I want fucking Charlie's Angels  Walking around this motherfucker  Absolutely  That's what I want  Three  That's right  Three girls  One better than two  We're not going to get Charlie's Angels  No  We might  They're not really doing much these days  The golden girls  Yes  That's it  What else is in the binder  We covered it for today  Yeah I'm pretty good  I'm just going to start working on stuff  For the weekend shows  What  It's a fucking Thursday 
[03:16:00]  You can never get ahead  The weekend is tomorrow  Right  Well  A lot of people's weekend starts on Thursday night  Yeah  Ah that's true  The unofficial  The unofficial  Thursday  The other Friday  There you go  The unofficial kickoff to the weekend  What?  The unofficial kickoff to the weekend  The weekend  The weekend  Coming up  The weekend  Yeah  It's Friday  Ding  Ding  Ding  Ding  I knew it was coming  Yeah  A lover boy action  Even though it's Thursday  We're going to get into the weekend 
[03:16:30]  Point of view right now  So whatever you guys are doing  Make sure you take us along  For the best music all the time  Commercial free  Oh  Woo  I was getting nervous  That's not sticky for the listener  That was beautiful  No  Perfect  I gave the point to take us along  For the best music  He's arguing  And the sales point there  Was commercial free  He's fighting back  Go back  Go back  Let's go play that  I think Denny just threatened Jim  Look out  Radio wars  We're in meetings all day now 
[03:17:00]  Right  Yeah  Trying to save Denny's job  Hey you're firing Denny  Yeah okay  Alright well  He's a good score  No lost  One of my favorites  The weekend's here  I don't really care for this song  I think it was in the 80's  But the weekend means  More time to stare at your  The fat pig of the life  Oh  No you can't just say  That's it  But I would listen to that all day  Alright give me the song there 
[03:17:30]  Iraq  Hey everyone  The weekend's coming up  Hope you have great plans  Maybe family, friends  Get away from that computer  You've been jerking off all week  Time to fuck real women  On Sirius XM  That was good  Nice  But he did say hey everyone  He didn't talk to just one person  Oh shit  You're having an air check meeting  See I did  I made it like you're just a group of people out there  I gotta talk to the individual  One person  To practice that 
[03:18:00]  To practice that I always used to hold up a telephone  As you know to the microphone  So I'd make like I was speaking to one person  Instead of just broadcasting  He's not a real person  Hey what's  You know what's going on  Yeah  That can't be true  I swear people think this is a bit  He held up a phone  This is all  Like I'm talking to you  This is all shit radio guys do  Oh my god  One on one  Just one on one  One on one  He must be the shittiest guy to have a phone call with ever  How you doing  Hey I hope your weekend's going well  I am 
[03:18:30]  I just like to practice all the time  All the time right  You got it  You learning  Yes I am  You got another one  I remember the individual  Yes  It's all about the individual  It's always good to hone your craft  I was just thinking of Anthony talking to one person  But nobody wants to hear  Hey Hitler  That's how the burger came out  Yes  You guys are really cutting into Sam's time here right  Yeah  Much to the listeners pleasure  Is that bad when that happens  No as long as you have some good content  Content is king 
[03:19:00]  Content is everything  Content is king  Oh well  Plus you know we could have played our exclusive live version of Working for the Weekend  Oh that one  That is a good one  It is an exclusive  Dennis thank you so much  Thank you guys  Dennis Falcone always a pleasure  It's Jackie  What can we say  It has been said already  One more day  What a delight  One more day  Jackie Blue  It is sad  You don't even know the song  No I don't  You sing it beautifully  Could you give her a little Jackie Blue as we leave 
[03:19:30]  What?  No they say why was Jackie hired  Oh my god  Good joke  We have to save Jimmy now  This is your song Jackie Blue  We'll see you tomorrow  Thank you  Thank you  Jackie Blue  There's her life from inside of her room  Hearts and smile when she's wearing a frown 
[03:20:00]  Ooh Jackie  You're not so down  You like your life in a freeform style  You'll take any ins but you'd love your mind  There never seems to be quite enough  Floating around to feel your loving cup  Ooh ooh ooh Jackie Blue  What's a game girl if you never lose 
[03:20:30]  Ask the winner and you're probably fine  Ooh Jackie they've lost some time  Don't get that panda angry  You better watch your step  Opie and Anthony have left the building  Left  Left  Left the building  After O&A Live  With Sam Roberts  Roberts  This is After Opie and Anthony Live 
[03:21:00]  Here's your host Sam Roberts  Welcome  You out there  I'm speaking directly to you  You're with me on After Opie and Anthony Live  And Jim is here too  You know after the show Opie was asking about Denny  And he goes I think  He goes I'm starting to think you know Denny's aware 
[03:21:30]  Of what he's saying obviously  And he's kind of aware of the bit  And he was saying  He thinks that Denny probably put the sheet together  Of like tips for jocks just for the bit  And I told him absolutely not  Like when I started doing stuff on Hits 1  They gave me a sheet exactly like that  I threw it in the garbage  I didn't put it in plastic and put it in a binder  But that's it  Those are the instructions  That they really  Right  Still give to DJs  Yeah I don't 
[03:22:00]  Think you get anywhere listening to those  To be very honest with you  And it's so weird because  Like  It's a breakdown of all the instructions  That every DJ has done for the last 50 years  But then it also says  Be original  Don't sound like everybody else  You know but there's nothing original or unpredictable  About any of the instructions on this page  They're all shit  You gotta be yourself  I think the most  I mean then again the Wolf Band Jack  But he was himself  His own personality  Yeah  I just don't like radio voices  And I don't like the sanitized news 
[03:22:30]  The way they all sound accentless  And when we were watching  It's the same concept  Like when we were watching  The Dick Cavett show  How there was something refreshing  About seeing him act like a human being  On television  And seeing the weird pauses  And the sort of stumbles  And  The imperfections  Things not working  Yeah it reminds you like  Oh that's a human being  That I can relate to  Yeah  And it makes it  It makes it comfortable to watch  Like  You know  And again Mike Douglas was the first  I watched an uncomfortable interview  With him in the Jackson 5 
[03:23:00]  Recently  Maybe two months ago  I watched it  And they're all young kids  It's so funny that you go home  And just go on YouTube  And watch old talk show clips  Sometimes I do  Yeah  Because there's one Mike Douglas clip  I really love  And it's Richard Pryor  Because he would be on a lot  And he was  Someone from his  I think it was like  November 25th of 74  I'm trying to get the whole episode  Because I saw the moment  Where his school teacher  His childhood teacher  Came on  And he was crying 
[03:23:30]  When he  Like I think that he wasn't expecting her  So they kind of brought her on  To surprise Pryor  It really caught him off guard  And then later  Is when he had that famous  Milton Berle fight  With Pryor  Was that  Was that his grandma  Possibly?  No  No  Her name was  Not Miss Rudolph  I forget the teacher's name  Because I think I remember  Seeing that clip  Somewhere  It was not his grandmother  It was one  It was maybe his teacher  When he did I think  Rumpelstiltskin  When he was a kid  I know her name  Because I've googled her  To see if I could find the  Find the clip 
[03:24:00]  But it seemed like a real  Like genuine surprise  Oh god  It absolutely was  And they kind of sat there  In this kind of weirdness  But realness  Yeah  That was good  Yeah Mike brought  And that  And Dick Cavett  Talked about this  On the show yesterday  Or in the dressing room  When Mike Douglas  Would have guest hosts  Yeah  He would  One time he had  Like  If you were a guest host  Of Mike Douglas  You were allowed  To pick your co-host  And Sly  From Sly and the Family Stone  Would be there a lot  And he picked Ali 
[03:24:30]  Wow  And Sly would look like  He was high and drunk  And Ali was really irritated  And he thought that he was  Kind of Uncle Toming it up  And you know  I think I've seen that clip  Yeah  Dancing for white folks  And you know  And Ali  I think Ali liked him  But it was just  You know  It's like you're watching your  It's like watching a good friend  Make an asshole out of himself  And part of that  Is like  Trying to make sure  You maintain everybody's attention  Because there's so much to do now  You don't want anybody  There's you know  There's 150 channels  And then you could also 
[03:25:00]  Just turn off your TV  And watch something on your iPad  Right  Or just do nothing  Whatever  Whereas before  It was like yeah  Once you had your channel on  You kind of leave it on that channel  Yeah  But it's also  You wouldn't see a moment like that  Because people  You wouldn't have Ali  Calling Sly  An Uncle Tom  On the Tonight Show  I don't know if he said that word  But he was  He was saying  We can't be clowning like this  You know  And he's like  But even that kind of racial discussion  Wouldn't happen on network television  Because they're afraid of the complaints  Like it's amazing to me 
[03:25:30]  How a few complaints override  An amazingly real moment  And I don't get it  I'm not in that business  But they figured out  How to make a lot of money too  So  True  It's easy to go  They're shitty and they're dumb  But they make a lot of money  And maybe  Maybe  The people  Maybe the general public  Wants everything to be polished  And easy  And digestible  And nothing to worry about  I turn on the TV  Because I have a stressful enough day  Nothing to worry about anymore  Because I want to do a talk show  That's my goal 
[03:26:00]  Like a video one  Like a visual talk show  Because I love interviewing people  I always have fun  When we do it here  And  But I don't want it to be  Perfect  Would you just do an interview show  Or would you do a full on  Talk show?  I don't know how long it would be  Somewhere between  Four to seven minutes  I want to do interviews  But I want to do a monologue  And also  Sketches that I film  Pre-shot sketches  Yeah  And like  You know  People  Kind of a combination  Of the fun we have in here  Like fucking with each other  And having our friends in  And a talk show 
[03:26:30]  But  You know  Not on a real network  I say  I say  I'm not on like  Like maybe a cable channel  Yeah  Because there's a lot more pressure  For time and language  Or I mean  It'd be great  If you could find  You could kind of  Be the first person  To do something like that  Just on Netflix  Or on Hulu  And it gets uploaded that day  You know what I mean?  They wouldn't want me  Why?  Because I'm not big enough  Netflix now  Everybody is going to them  But don't you think  If it was like  This is our first  Daily show 
[03:27:00]  It's five days a week  Because they're not going to get  I want a weekly one  Right?  I would start weekly  Like Kamau Bell started weekly  And now he's going daily  Oh they're putting him on daily?  Yes  That's huge  It's very big  For him  And I don't think  I'm ready to do a daily show  I'd rather get my feet wet  In a weekly one  I would think that's  A healthier way to start  Once a week  Just going  No I'm ready to go every day  Weekends too  But Netflix would have  No interest in me  Because again  They have Kevin Spacey  They have their pick  Of everyone right now  Right  Because all these fucking  Movie stars are doing TV 
[03:27:30]  Like Cheetle  And all these guys  Are doing television now  I bet Hulu would do it  I don't know  If they'd use me though  They might do it  With someone else  Someone who's more  Network friendly  But again  These are not people  That necessarily want  To do it with Jim Norton  So you're looking  At some place  Like an FX type channel  Or whatever  What if you shot  The pilot yourself  That's what Bob Kelly  Keeps telling me to do  But I have to find  The right place to do it  And  Well I mean look  You're going to the  Gathering of the Juggalos  Unfortunately I'm not  Going with you  Because Troy's not here 
[03:28:00]  And you know  It wouldn't  It didn't work  And E-Rack's got plans  This weekend  So beyond that  It doesn't  It doesn't really work  But you know  You look at what  The ICP did  And  They just kind of  Did stuff themselves  And waited for something  To work  And then eventually  Somebody said  Oh  You know  They're doing this themselves  We can capitalize on this  And that's what Fuse did  They were like  Oh look at all this  Everybody talks about  The Insane Clown Posse  When they're doing this  Or that  Let's try to make  Some videos with them  Let's put them on a show  And everything  So I think  I mean 
[03:28:30]  Nowadays  That's what you have to do  If nobody's  You just have to go out  And film it yourself  And you got enough friends  I know  That you could have  A nice guest  On this pilot or whatever  Just try to get Ozzy to do it  I just gotta  Well I gotta find a  I wouldn't want Ozzy  As the first guest  Because it would be  They'd be too nerve-wracking  With getting  The format to it down  And the cadence of it  And the positioning  That I wouldn't want  To interview my idol  Like Mike Tyson  Is a guy I'd love  To interview on  Because I love Mike  You still get nervous 
[03:29:00]  Around Ozzy?  It's weird  Like  It's nervous  Even though when I saw  I told you  I saw he was very nice  When I saw him  Kissed you on your head  Yeah  But it's a nervousness  Because when you're a fan  For that long  You just don't want to  Look like an asshole  Yeah  I mean even though  We know each other  And I've become friendly  Like Dice became  A good friend of mine  And I wasn't nervous  Around Dice anymore  But I spent a lot  Of time with Dice  And that is kind of a thing  When you're a fan  Of somebody  The risk  And you're doing  What you do 
[03:29:30]  In front of them  You don't want to risk  Them not liking  What you do  Well with Dice  It was like  We worked together  And like I knew  That he respected me  As a performer  Like when somebody  Respects you  As a comedian  To comedian  It makes you  More comfortable  Around them  Because you know  Like that most important  Part of my personality  I know that he likes  And he accepts  He thinks I'm funny  Right  Like Ozzy  I've never done a gig  With Ozzy  You know what I mean  Like so yeah  I would just  I wouldn't say  I'm really nervous  Around him  But I'm not as relaxed  As I am with you  Or Oprah Ann  What are you thinking  About the gathering 
[03:30:00]  I hope it goes good man  I think it'll be okay  Because you know  You know the two guys  Are very cool  And I think it'll go well  I hope  Our episode aired last night  So let's hope it  When none of the people  At the gathering  Will see it  Well they might not  All be at the gathering yet  I mean it's only Wednesday  It started this morning  Or yesterday morning  Yeah  So every one of them  Might not get there  Wednesday night  A lot of them  Might get there Thursday  Or Friday  And it's crazy where it is  Because like just to fly in  What's it  It's like two hours  From the airport  To the hotel  And then an hour 
[03:30:30]  From the hotel  To the venue  Yeah  So we're flying into Nashville  And then me and Kenny  Will go to the hotel  And just relax  Yeah  And you know  Two hours outside of Nashville  So are you going to try  To familiarize yourself  With the audience  Like are you going to  Sit there and  Nah I don't give a fuck man  Not to be a dick  But it's like you know  I do my act  Yeah  You either like it  Or you don't like it  You like it or you don't  And oh Kenny's texting me  Okay I gotta go  Alright man  It'll be good to be down there  And not that I don't give a fuck  But what am I going to do  I can't change who I am  On stage 
[03:31:00]  I might play a little bit  With them  Or walk around  For a couple hours first  And see what's going on there  But I get in  And get out for gigs  Like I don't hang  And that's the way to do it too  You're not saying  You don't give a fuck  About the audience  You're saying  I'm an artist  This is what I do  And blah blah blah  Yeah because if you start going  Oh I want to do  What they want me to do  Or incorporate all of them  Into my  Right then you're just a shell  You're a shell  And you can't do it  You can maintain that  For five minutes  But you can't do a good  45 minute set that way  Yeah  Alright well hopefully  My plane won't crash  I don't want to be killed  Going to this gig  We're coming back from it  Dumb superstitions 
[03:31:30]  I have to go to LA next week  And I'm doing a bunch of  Podcasts to promote  So um  I'm going to be out in LA  Next week too  Oh yeah when are you going?  Uh  Tuesday  I'll be gone  Tuesday  I'm going out to LA next week  I'll be there Tuesday  I'll be gone by Tuesday  You know I'm going out Sunday  And I leave Wednesday night  After Chelsea Lately  I fly home  Maybe I'll see you there  On Wednesday  Alright why not  Tuesday  Or Tuesday  Well I land on Tuesday  I don't know  What time do you land?  What are you 11.59pm?  The fuck  Alright I'll see you on Tuesday 
[03:32:00]  And Wednesday then  And Thursday  And Thursday  Alright well  Enjoy your flight  If I'm not killed  As long as the plane doesn't crash  I don't think it will  And you know why?  Because generally  When somebody says  I hope I don't die  In a plane crash  They don't  Until they do  You'd be the first  You're going to break the chain  Yeah  Ironically  We'll play this audio  Comedian jokes his way  Into death  You think that's what  The headline would be?  Yeah  It's very tasteless  It wouldn't be a headline 
[03:32:30]  It would just be a fucking  In on page 18  A note  Where's Jackie?  I gotta sing a bun to Jackie  Jackie  She's coming  Alright  Coming in here  You're going to miss  Jackie's last day  I'm sure there'll be a  I know I miss Sydney's too  That sucks  I'm sure there'll be  A grand celebration for it  I hope so  As there was with Sydney's  Alright I will see you  There's Jackie  I'll see you later  Alright buddy  Yeah I am bummed out  That I'm not going to the gathering  But  Troy was my travel companion 
[03:33:00]  And as we learned  On the ONA show today  Troy's not fired  And that's official  He's not being fired  But  He's not back at work yet  And he won't be back  At work this week  That's for sure  So he's not going  To the gathering  E-Rock is adding  A wing to his house  This weekend  So he won't  Be able to go  To the gathering  That's true right?  Yeah that's true  Right  So  I can't go by myself  Because the whole point  Was to get video  And audio  And all that stuff  And I need somebody  To hang out with  To run the equipment  And everything 
[03:33:30]  So  I'm not going to  Make it this time  Rob Cross is super  Bummed out  Rob Cross who helps  Run the channel  What didn't Rob go with you?  Rob yeah  Call him up  Alright  Call him up  Leave the mics on obviously  Call him up in his office  And ask if he wants  To go to the gathering  Of the Juggalos with me  And if he brings up  His family  Tell him he can bring  His daughter  She'd have a blast  Come on  I know he listens  He's the one guy  In management  That listens to this show  Even when you don't  Want him to  I know  He was listening 
[03:34:00]  With Zito and Troy  He got us all in trouble  He's not there  He's not answering  Well see if you can  Get a hold of him  Later on  Because I wanted  Why wouldn't he come  We'll paint him up  And everything  It'll be a  No he's not there  Sean in Ohio  Hey Sam  You're talking about  Plans  Since you're  Turning 30  Here soon  And it seems like  You're going through  Like a little bit  Of a midlife crisis  And from listening  To your Sam Roberts  Show online podcast  Yeah  You're eating salmon now 
[03:34:30]  I mean what are  Your plans for the future  Say after  Are you wanting to  To like possibly  Go into movies  Or radio  Stay with radio  I mean what's your plan  Well if somebody  Offered me a role  In a feature film  I would probably  Take it  But at the end  Of the day  My plan is to  Continue to be a  Professional broadcaster  And to keep moving  Forward where that  Takes me  You know what I mean  I mean I don't want to  I enjoy doing the  After show  But what I want to be  Doing is my own  Show regularly  And I made that  Very clear I think 
[03:35:00]  To everybody  Associated with the show  Everybody in management  Everybody who's  Listening at home  E-Rock does that come  As a big surprise to you  That that's my goal  Not at all  I mean I listen to  I mean I love  Sam and Dave  I don't know  What happened there  But you know  I'd be great  To get a t-shirt too  You know  You're just trying  To get a shirt  Of all the  Of all the  Of all the sneaky tricks  I'm not giving that guy  A shirt  But yeah  I mean that doesn't  Come as any surprise  To you E-Rock  Does it?  That you want to be  In movies?  That's the other thing 
[03:35:30]  That people are like  So are you going to  Stay in radio  Or are you going to  Move to TV or movies?  Like it's such an  Easy transition  Right  Like oh good idea  Person on the phone  You know what I should do  Jim said he would  I would also enjoy  Doing a talk show  Well Sam's going to  Take 135 after  Seth Meyers on NBC  Yeah I'm going to see  As long as they're  Doing talk shows  Over on NBC  I'll just do that  And I figure I'll do  The show after Seth Meyers  For about three years  Then take over for  Seth Meyers for two years  And then do the  Tonight Show by the time  I'm 40 
[03:36:00]  I don't see why not  Sounds like a good plan  Right?  Tonight Show with Sam Roberts?  That actually has a  Very nice ring to it  What kind of theme music  Would you have?  Mainly Rob  Jazzy like  No I use Black Skinheads  By Kanye West  Wow  Is anyone going to  Know him then?  I don't know  But he'll be on the show  For sure  Yeah no I don't know  And I'm not going  Through a midlife crisis  Or an early life crisis  Or whatever they call it  There's no crisis here  I'm not panicking  I'm embracing  Turning 30  I'm turning 30  In about a month or so 
[03:36:30]  And I'm ready for it  I'm embracing it  I'm not sad about it  You're not panicking  You're turning 30  And then we only have  A year left on the contract?  No I'm happy about it  You're not freaking out  Your life's not over  Because guess what?  They're going to  Fucking resign  Like they always do  I'm not worried  About it at all  Plus  Hey what do they got to do?  I'm confident  In my abilities  That if God forbid  That they did not  Resign in a year  I would find  The next thing  You know what I mean?  At 30  I'd be 31 at that point  I'd be ready to 
[03:37:00]  To do what I have to do  But  You know you come in  To this studio  The Opie and Anthony show  And you dress a little nicer  And we talked about this  Last week a little bit  But yeah  I tucked in a shirt  Like this is not new  It's the same pants  I've been wearing all week  This is the third day in a row  I've worn these pants  But today  As far as Kenny  Called them skinny jeans  Skinny jeans  Yeah Kenny keeps calling them  Skinny jeans  They're definitely not jeans  And they just fit  And I have skinny legs  I'm sorry  But  You know you come in 
[03:37:30]  And you dress a little nicer  Than usual  And  And the world ends  And everybody thinks  You're part of some kind of crisis  No  I've realized  You know maybe  It's time for me to look  A little nicer  I can put myself together  A little bit more  Well Opie said  You're going to the management side  I'm not going to the management side  You know what would happen  If they  If Opie and Anthony  Did not resign in a year  And management said  Look we don't have  An on air position  For you right now  But  We would like you  To be the head of this channel  Or to become a senior executive  Blah blah blah  I would say no thank you 
[03:38:00]  I would not be interested  In that position  Because that's not  The road  That I'm taking  At the moment  Even for a high  Six figure salary  I don't give a shit  About a salary  And I think everybody  Around here knows  That I'm not in this  For the money  Otherwise I wouldn't  Have spent eight years here  Right  I'm in this  Because this is what I do  I'm learning  How to be  A wonderful  Professional broadcaster  You know  And how's that going  Terribly  I'm obviously not doing  A great job  I'm not  I'm not doing as well 
[03:38:30]  As I thought  You have not figured out  The formula  How to  How some of your failures  Make you stumble  Into bigger ventures  And a lot more money  Right  I haven't figured that out  You're not failing enough  Yeah I gotta fail harder  That's the thing  I'm not like  I'm not over the top succeeding  But I'm also not failing  You gotta do one of those things  You need peaks and valleys  And you're just flatlining right now  I don't like that  You gotta shake it up  Yeah  I mean you're flatlining  But you're very comfortable  In your flatline  You're taking the flatline 
[03:39:00]  And you're taking a little nap on it  You're lying  You're lying down on that flatline  And you like it  You like where you're at  I'm keeping things regular  Right  Yeah  Just like your diet  Just like your bowel movements  Yes  Good  No more pizza  No  That helps a lot  It's been a couple weeks  But yeah  And like the guy I was talking about  I was talking about on my podcast  Yeah I ate salmon  When we were in  Montreal  Montreal  Because there was nothing else  On the menu for me  But that's one of those things  That I know my food hangups  Are in my head  And it's  I think it's 
[03:39:30]  It's like a  OCD  I don't know what it is  But you get to a point  Where you're like  I don't need  Everybody at this table  Looking at me  Like I'm a special needs kid  Anymore  What if I just  Shoved some salmon  In my mouth  And forced my body  To  To  To  To  Send the salmon  Down my throat  Wouldn't be the first time  Was salmon a texture issue for you  No  I didn't mind the texture at all  But it was just  The psychological hangup  Of something I don't eat  Was all that was 
[03:40:00]  Replaying in my head  And I  You just have to get past it  It's a weird weird thing  You need to talk to somebody  No I don't need to talk to somebody  I'm solving my problems on my own  You need a food shrink  I'm not having a food shrink  Okay  You want me to have a food shrink  Roland wants me to have  The cat daddy over my house  To take care of my cat  What?  I don't need any of it  I don't need any of it  Because Roland loves the cat daddy  Have you seen that show  That he wears worse cats?  I saw it because  Roland got the books  A while ago right?  And he kept showing everybody 
[03:40:30]  The book  Of course  So I said  I need to see what this show is  And it  It's  If  If Guy Fieri took care of pets  He wears flame shirts  Has rock and roll cars  And then comes in  And shows you  Why your cat's peeing  On the  On the living room floor  Let's go to Paul  In Arizona  Yeah  I was going to say  I think the reason  That you're not  Failing up  Into a more successful position  Is because you do have  A pretty sweet gig  And you're comfortable in it  And maybe if you  Didn't have that wing  Of an O&A  That you would be forced 
[03:41:00]  To go out there  And put yourself  In a position  Where you could possibly fail  Well I see that point  But number one  I do this show every day  And there's a high probability  That it will fail  Do you know what happens  Every time  The show starts  I think to myself  This is going to be  Another shitty show  I'm going to fail  I'm not going to do well  And then I always do  Okay  Never great  Always okay  But what do you do  Do you quit a good job  Because you think  Oh I'll fail upwards  That sounds like  A horrible psychology  No I think 
[03:41:30]  You keep what you got  And you got to keep  Striving on the side  And that's what I do  And you want to talk  About taking risks  How about I put  YouTube videos up  That are just me  It's just the camera  Pointed at my face  And then have to  Deal with  Shitty ONA Facebook fans  Going you're ugly  You're ugly  And it's like  But you know what  I keep putting them out  You tried  Because content is king  Okay  Not a bunch of dudes  Telling me whether or not  I'm good looking  Those videos are up  On the ONA Facebook  I don't want them up 
[03:42:00]  On the ONA Facebook anymore  I don't need them there  Okay  It's uh  At Not Sam  At Not Sam is where they are  Thank you Paul  Alright thank you  The Not Sam fans  Can come to me  Okay  That's exactly what  Paul was talking about  I don't need to leech off  All the Opie and Anthony  Listeners  If Opie and Anthony  Listeners don't like me  You don't have to like me  I am embracing  The people who appreciate  What Sam Roberts does  Those are the people  That I love  Okay  Uh  Larry in Texas  Sam Roberts 
[03:42:30]  Professional broadcaster  Larry  Sam  I'll tell you  I'm starting to get  A little disappointed in you  Why  I really truly am  And I hate to criticize  You know I'm loathe to criticize  But I have to say that  Alright  You're Sam Roberts  True  You understand that  True  You understand that  I'm serious about this  You're Sam Roberts  Let me sit with it  Okay  You're Sam Roberts  Not somebody else  Nobody else is Sam Roberts  You're Sam Roberts  That's right 
[03:43:00]  There's a Canadian  And it bothers me  There's a Canadian rock star  Whose name is Sam Roberts  But that guy drives me nuts  I hate that guy  Remember when I made you  Take a photo with him  Yeah I was like  What are you doing  He was like  Oh Sam Roberts  His name's Sam Roberts  It's dose Sam Roberts  I hate that guy  I think if you dig deep enough  You'll find that he stole it  Just like they stole  The lonely Virgil concept  That's right  But Sam  There's no reason  There's no reason  That you and David Lee Roth  Couldn't do shows  This week  I'm serious 
[03:43:30]  You know what happened  I'm not bullshit  Right  I'm not trying to  Bad your ego  Or jack you off  Okay  I'm serious  Well look  It'd be a great  Fucking five hours  It'd be great  Fucking five hours  If somebody wants me  To do those shows  Next week  Well I can do  Monday and Tuesday  Otherwise I'll be in  Los Angeles  But if somebody wants me  To do Monday and Tuesday  All you gotta do is ask  Sam  Let me whisper this  So nobody else hears it  Okay  It's a lot easier  To get forgiveness  Than it is permission  My man  Just come in  And jack the mics up 
[03:44:00]  Guess who's here  For the next five hours  That's right  Exactly right  Guess who's here  For the next five hours  What are they gonna do  March in there  Make a big scene  Or they say  You know  Nope  They'll go let him go  Hey  The kid wants to do five hours  He took the mic  Let him go  What can we do  That's exactly right  Just like  You know  All the stuff  On the weekend  You just did the stuff  Right  Just like the after show  Instead of doing  What they envision  Look what it's become  You have your openers 
[03:44:30]  Okay  And you have you  Alright  Thank you very much Larry  And uh  Look  It's the truth Sam  Just do it man  Just do it  I appreciate it  Uh  You know what you need Sam  Yeah what's that  You need an efficiency expert  Can you do that for me  Larry could do it for you  I don't know  People really hate Larry  When he calls in  I like Larry  I love Larry  He seems to have  Your best interest  In heart there  True  Uh  Joker in Louisiana  Hey Sam  Real quick  I know it's the end of the show

[03:48:00]  That guy's famous  Let's see  What else is going on  So yeah  The gathering  Unfortunately not happening  For me  However  Jim's going to be there  So if you're headed down that way  I think tomorrow night  At 11pm  Is when he'll be there  Should ask Jim  To get you a shirt  Yeah I should have  An official gathering shirt  See I was all excited too  Because they were going to  Give us passes  And everything  Like I wanted to have  A gathering of the Juggalos  Laminate  In my shoebox 
[03:48:30]  I have a shoebox  Full of all the laminates  We've gotten  You know how cool  It would have been  To have a gathering laminate  Although they may not  Give laminates  They might just paint  Your face a certain way  So they can tell  I don't know if they  Actually print laminates  It's not exactly  A professionally run place  They give you a hatchet  And a bottle of Faygo  Maybe that's all it is  It's a golden bottle of Faygo  Jesse in Florida  Yeah I got a solution  For the voice problem  First of all Jesse  It's not a voice problem  But go on  All right  I'll get the jack  And three cartons  Of Campbell non-filters 
[03:49:00]  That's what everybody says  Hard liquor  And smoking cigarettes  Is the way to go  Well  I don't know  If that's for sure  But  I will tell you this  How's Jackie handling  Handling the goodbyes  In there  She's  It'll be hard tomorrow  She said it'll be  Harder tomorrow  Today it's okay  Today it's okay  Because she had to  Say goodbye to Jim  That must have been  A little rough  But tomorrow I think  And is she  Is she expecting  A big celebration  Since we gave one to Sydney 
[03:49:30]  She's running in to see you  Of course she is  She loves it in here  She's not going to miss air time  586  Yeah sorry Sam  Yeah um  Jason from Detroit  A couple buddies I know  They wrestle for the  Juggalo Championship Wrestling  Uh huh  You don't get a laminate  You get a medal  It's uh  It looks like a  A big medal that you  Walk around with  As your backstage passes  So  That would have been  Fucking awesome  To have a Juggalo medal  That's all I've ever  Wanted in life  It would be the  Greatest award 
[03:50:00]  I could ever get  Alright thanks buddy  Jackie  You're not expecting  Some kind of big  Celebration tomorrow  Are you  No Sydney's cake  Was enough for me  Do you think  But do you think  That they're going  To throw you one  I hope  You do right  I'll be a little sad  I don't need the balloons  You understand  You just want a cake  I just want a cake  I love cake  You understand the insanity  Who doesn't love cake  I love cake  But I didn't get a cake  When I graduated  I'm sorry  Graduated when I left  You got a job  I guess  But I had to claw for it  And then I still have to  Put up with shit 
[03:50:30]  About my voice  And my clothes  People just hate  Because they're not you  Right now  What's height  It's a weird accent  You have  What would you  What are you going to  Are you going to  Bring your mom in tomorrow  I don't know  Eric says I should  And she really wants to  Of course you should  I'm super nervous  It's can either go  Really good  Bring her in at 9.30  Or really really bad  For your room  Going away  First of all  The fact that we're  Actually scheduling it  Going away  Is disgusting  I'm just doing 
[03:51:00]  What I was told  There's two things  To keep in mind  Number one is  The last time  An intern brought in  His mother  His mother ended up  Getting a lap dance  Oh my god  However  Troy won't be here tomorrow  And Troy's the one  That gave her the lap dance  So  I bet he would probably  Be the one I'd be  Most nervous about  Around my mom  I mean I think  All interns  Should worry about  Their moms around Troy  But  So maybe  You'd be fine  I'm not gonna give her 
[03:51:30]  A lap dance  Thank you  I'm a married man  I can't  I can't put my wife  Through that kind of  Humiliation  And quite frankly  I can't put your mom  Through that kind of  Humiliation  I don't think she could  Do it  No  She's been married  For 20  I mean if she was  Single I would never  Ever bring my mother  In here  But I mean she's  Been married for 28  Years  I figure it's  Alright  Do you think  That the men  Who are associated  With this show  Respect the boundaries  Of marriage  Oh what do you  Mean this show  The God fearing men  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Who praise women  Oh come on  I think you should  I think you should 
[03:52:00]  Bring your mom in  You think so  I think it'd be funny  Just for the awkwardness  Just because it would  Get just  It'd just be weird  And uncomfortable  Wouldn't it  That's what I was  Thinking the whole time  I thought  It's gonna be a little weird  But my thing  With this show  And I've been here  For a long time  Is that weird  And awkward  It's good  Always  Just go for the weirdest  Thing you could think of  Just always go for weirdness  An intern came to me once  On his last day  And said  Alright this is like  My last day  And they think  I'm a liar  His name was Rob  And he had a reputation  For lying about everything  And on his  Right before his last day  He said 
[03:52:30]  I wanna leave on an upswing  And I heard he got  This idea from Roland  But he said  I'm thinking about  Coming in  In a pig suit  Handing out  Egg McMuffins  And throwing up  Monopoly money  In the air  And saying  I'm making it  Nagel in this bitch  That's such a  Roland suggestion  And I go  You wanna do this  In the middle of the  O&A show  He goes yeah  And I go  I think it's a great idea  Cause it's weird  Right  Why not make an ass  Out of himself  And it was a huge success  So I would recommend  Bringing in your mom  We'll have to wait  Till tomorrow  To see  It'll be a surprise 
[03:53:00]  I can't wait  If I decide or not  Stay tuned  The Ron and Fez  Have a big show  Coming up next  The Ron and Fez  Have a big show  The Ron now  Not just Ron  Ron and Fez  Both have a big show  Coming up next  And we'll be back  With more of this  Tomorrow  Goodbye  The Opie and Anthony  Show is now over  For real this time  Check out the O&A show  On Facebook  At facebook.com  Slash Opie and Anthony  And catch Opie and Anthony  Live Monday through Friday  From 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern  The Opie and Anthony  Channel  On Sirius XM </pre>
