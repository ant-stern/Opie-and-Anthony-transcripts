<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a nostalgic trip down memory lane, focusing on the hosts' experiences in the 1990s alternative rock scene.  They reminisced about numerous bands like Veruca Salt, Bush, Toadies, Soul Asylum, Everclear, Third Eye Blind, the Nixons, and Corrosion of Conformity, recounting backstage stories, encounters with groupies, and their own often awkward interactions with women.  This segment heavily featured music from these bands, interspersed with profane commentary and jokes.  Opie's upcoming Boston birthday trip was mentioned, briefly segueing into a political tangent involving Michael Moore and the upcoming election.  A new animated music video, "Bowling for Behave" by Coke Logic, was also discussed and played.

This 90s music theme continued into the next segment, now an annual tradition for the show, spanning seven years. Opie and Anthony debated the merits of various songs and bands, including Hum (initially misidentified as Spacehog), Cake, and Aerosmith’s American Idol performance.  A significant portion focused on the song "Pendulum," its various versions, and criticisms thereof.  Gene Simmons and a past negative interaction with him were heavily discussed, with Sam providing details of the conflict.  Drew Boogie was in studio promoting his new album, *Radio Gold*, providing musical interludes throughout.  Big A and Iraq contributed to the recurring "uncomfortably close news" segment, reading news stories in close proximity for comedic effect.  The segment was filled with numerous offensive jokes targeting each other and celebrities.

The show then transitioned to a news segment.  The hosts discussed Snooki’s pregnancy (a boy, returning for Jersey Shore season 6, but living separately due to unsanitary conditions), allegations of sexual battery against John Travolta (with a poorly recorded account of an alleged encounter), and the arrest of a 13-year-old and two juveniles for plotting to kill her mother.  Significant microphone issues plagued this section, leading to repeated instructions for the hosts to get closer to the mics, even resulting in them being told to press their foreheads together, prompting homoerotic jokes.  These audio difficulties persisted through sports updates. Drew Boogie returned to play his song “Mimi Beardsley,” containing sexually explicit and offensive lyrics.

The conversation shifted to Opie's birthday celebration at Oceans, a seafood restaurant, leading to a discussion about Mug Shots, a bar displaying celebrity arrest photos, with humorous exchanges about Al Pacino's mugshot.  Ventriloquist Otto, along with his unseen partner George, joined the show, sharing anecdotes, including one about a woman palming his forehead after he insulted her hairline and another involving a woman whose grandfather had recently passed away.  Otto also discussed his experiences with prostitution and the substantial amounts of money he spent, detailing a $1000 encounter.  Further discussion of the John Travolta allegations ensued, including second-hand accounts.  Vic Henley also joined in studio.  The segment concluded with more discussion of the Travolta allegations and an extended, off-key, rambling, and offensive musical performance by John Valby, initially at a Steinway piano store and later in the studio. The segment ended with Drew Boogie performing "Laugh Your Tears Away" from *Radio Gold*, another song with offensive lyrics.

The final segment featured a phone call with comedian Bill Burr. The conversation began with a discussion of a video of Jim Norton being choked by Randy Couture and Patrice O'Neal's comedic reaction.  This led to a graphic discussion of Jim Norton's experiences with violence during comedy bits and a vulgar discussion about vaginal mesh.  Crude jokes about aging women and their genitalia followed. A significant portion involved a bet on a Celtics-Sixers game, filled with humorous (and offensive) banter.  Burr recounted a story about his stuck car horn.  Otto and George joined the call, promoting their upcoming shows and YouTube channel, followed by Drew Boogie sharing anecdotes about the making of *Animal House*.  The call ended with more crude jokes and plugs for various events and podcasts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Put enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah. Good morning.  Good might as well be Friday morning.  Good virtual Friday morning.  I like that.  This is an easy week.  What are we doing, Friday and Monday?  Easy peasy Japanesey for you.  Oh, yeah. I took that day yesterday. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, wow.  Kenny's like, you're coming back for one day?  Yeah, why not?  That would have been nice to take Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  Oh, shit.  Sunday, Monday, Wednesday.  Tuesday, Friday.  Blow your funny-looking tits up.  Exactly.  Nice fucking nipples, Dick.  Well, we take a Friday and Monday off for the big Memorial Day weekend.  Memorial Day weekend.  I like that idea.  Indeed you do.  I'm actually going to Boston.  Boffiston?  What's going on in Boston this weekend? 
[00:01:00]  What's going on there in Boffiston?  Any of the guys performing?  Because I'm going there.  Why are you going to Boston?  For my birthday.  Oh.  That's where you want to go?  We do, like, in our house, birthdays last a week.  Oh, shit.  So I'm still birthday-ing.  What are you doing?  The Opie and Anthony Show Market Tour?  Yeah.  So I'm going to be in Boffiston.  Boffiston.  Why?  Because I haven't been up there in a long fucking time.  You're going to go on the Duck Chars?  We're thinking Duck Chars.  Duck Chars.  I'm thinking North End. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, a little Italian food.  I may have looked up one of our old restaurants we used to go to.  One of our old haunts.  Is it Mother Anna's?  Where the main waiter who was the son of the owner used to hit on everybody.  Just trying to bang your chick?  I think so, yeah.  That fucker?  Well, fuck.  You could have her, man.  Who gives a fuck?  Oh, they were all fucking smitten and dreamy-eyed over this guy when we'd go in.  It's like, we're fucking making the money.  We're footing the bill.  And these two bitches are sitting there like all, oh! 
[00:02:00]  Tittering at this fucking waiter.  This fucking govone.  And I was pretty goddamn good-looking back then.  Still are, as far as I'm concerned.  Not anymore.  I'm not going to fucking front.  Not a guy in here who wouldn't fuck you.  I was a good-looking fucking kid back then.  It was an abomination.  Because then I had the Nixons drummer after my chick.  All these fucking guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she's, ah, every single fucking time. 
[00:02:30]  What about that time backstage at the Centrum when fucking Gavin was there from Bush?  Oh, yeah.  And both of them are,  all fucking vag-wet.  You know, though, I was cranking some music in my house the other day,  and Veruca Salt came in.  Ah, see.  See?  I had some music because people were over.  I was going with, like, classic alt.  Yeah.  Alternative or something. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And that stupid song came on, and guess who smiled inside?  Was it Caesar?  It was Caesar.  Yeah.  And then I have to, like, point it out, and my wife actually said, I know!  Like, yeah, we could have tag-teamed fucking Veruca Saul.  She says, I know, you've told me ten times.  You've got to keep reiterating that.  Let him know.  Because that was a hot one.  Yeah.  The blonde wanted me, the fucking brunette wanted Anthony.  That was good back in the day, I think it was, right?  And both of us, no, no, no, we can't do this. 
[00:03:30]  No, we're married.  No, no, no.  I'm married, and he's got a long-term girlfriend.  No, no, no, no, no.  We can't possibly go out and have sexual intercourse with rock girls.  Why would we?  Fast forward to the fucking girls.  You guys want to go skinny-dipping?  No, no, no, we can't do that either.  Yeah.  Got to go home to our miserable relationships.  Do you guys think you were putzes?  Oh, we were the worst.  Now, yeah, why go skinny-dipping with the fucking booze promotional girls? 
[00:04:00]  You know, they're always dogs.  Right.  No, they're not.  Oh, Jimmy.  And Rocco, who we make fun of, but he was offering us girls left and right.  Yeah, this girl wants to blow, yeah.  Dude.  No, no, no.  Let's all get in the rock bus and get blowjobs.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We can't do that.  What a couple of faggots.  God, I want a time machine.  I want to smack myself in the face. 
[00:04:30]  You would jump at a time machine and go back to that time, right?  I'd go back to that time.  Fuck.  And I'd pull myself aside and go, fuck everything that moves.  Oh, yeah.  And tell your bitch wife to go fuck herself.  I'd have herpes fucking hanging all over my body right now.  Herpes sores all over my body.  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Then I was telling her about the eight-hour CD signing in Springfield, Massachusetts.  I was reminiscing about Boston yesterday during my birthday dinner. 
[00:05:00]  Remember the eight-hour fucking, wow.  Yeah, she had them funny-looking quirky teeth.  Nah, she was all right, though.  I know.  Both were.  They were both all right.  I was back, God, I remember these videos where the camera would just shake with the drum beat.  And it was Instagram shit already.  Yeah, yeah.  It's an Instagram video.  That's Instagram filters.  Live motion Instagram filters.  Wait, what happened to the blonde?  She wasn't blonde yet?  Nah, I think her hair was still a brunette-ish.  Man, and we did everything in our power to keep that band going because we kind of liked the fact they liked us. 
[00:05:30]  I know.  We failed.  Baruka Salt's going to be in town.  Yes!  What do we need to do?  Yes, bring them in.  We'll take them.  Didn't we ruin the relationship when we stole their underwear or something?  Yeah, yeah.  They got a little pissed off at that.  They got a little pissy at the underwear theft.  Well, because then we were just-  It just goes to show, they're just bitches, too.  Because then we were trying to, like, give away the underwear on our radio show.  Yeah, we were being wacky DJs.  They didn't appreciate that.  We couldn't stop being wacky DJs for the relationship.  I don't know if it's wacky if you get to sniff something. 
[00:06:00]  I know.  What year's this video from?  96, 97?  Yeah.  Are they still together?  What's my guess?  94.  94 for Seether.  Wow.  Are they still together or no?  I don't know.  They're probably still eating it out in some shitholes.  Right.  Trying to make believe they're still kind of hot.  They have their fucking, probably a new album no one's heard about.  And they play all the songs off of that.  And everybody goes, come on, when are you going to play Seether?  They end their 20-minute set with Seether. 
[00:06:30]  And everybody goes, whoo!  It's the encore.  They were called us.  I forgot about the Gavin, what was his last name?  Gavin Rossdale.  Rossdale.  Our chicks were always fucking creaming over some other dude.  You're right.  Some other dudes.  You're right.  They used to fucking, like, get together and talk about it.  What about him?  And we're sitting there like the castrated cuckles.  Well, these fucking rock guys, they're just drooling over them. 
[00:07:00]  And we're the ones bringing them to the fucking rock guys.  They wouldn't have met Gavin if it wasn't for fucking us backstage.  Of course not.  Ah, what do you do?  I almost don't blame a woman, though.  Like, if I bring a woman and she meets, like, a big celebrity,  I almost feel bad for her that she has to look and go, oh, yeah, I'm with him.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of a shove it right back in their face.  You're leaving with me.  Yeah, look who she has to fuck.  Can I make her hold the camera and take a picture of me and the celebrity, too?  It's really humiliating for the girl. 
[00:07:30]  We still had fun.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't we?  I don't deny it.  We had a good time.  Sometimes those songs from the 90s pop up that we used to play on AAF,  and you get a visceral, like, feeling.  It's weird.  It's not even just a memory.  You, like, go, wow, I remember, like, how that fucking felt and smelt and sounded.  I think we were dumping baked beans on a naked chick when the song came out.  We used to have so much downtime, too.  Like, songs would be playing.  Remember the game we used to fucking take the pen and try to whip it on the console, 
[00:08:00]  and there was this little button panel on the console that had a little ledge on it?  Right.  And you used to have to whip the pen, get it to hop up onto the little ledge.  Right.  It's like, oh, there's a point.  Yeah, that's what we were doing.  And then you'd go, and it's like all the songs are playing.  Right.  You know, the fucking Toadies Possum Kingdom would be playing.  And we're like, you know, do you want to die?  Do you want to die?  And we're just, there's one point.  And then we looked at each other and said, you know what?  Maybe instead of playing this dumb game, we should start talking more. 
[00:08:30]  Maybe we should just talk more.  Maybe we should just get our careers going.  Because this music shit's not going to last forever.  Boys, what are you doing a talk show now, boys?  Yes, Brucie, we are.  God, how many times did we see the Toadies come through town?  Yeah.  I used to really like this song.  This is a good one.  Possum Kingdom rules.  Yeah.  It's too bad.  This has 90s written all over it.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  This is so fucking 90s.  I just hear it as a cool song.  I know.  Like, I don't, I guess I got to step backwards a little bit and kind of look at it. 
[00:09:00]  There are songs, though, that are just so fucking 90s.  But at the time, they were just, you know, songs.  This song was massively huge.  Yeah.  For that dumb station.  It's a big one.  We did, they did one of our shows, right?  Oh, God, yeah.  A few of them.  They'd always fucking play.  We had a lot of these guys before they were really big.  Who is this?  Toadies.  Toadies.  What was their follow-up?  It wasn't as good.  No.  This was, they try to work another song up there.  Is this Alt Rock? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What was their follow-up, Travis?  You know?  Yeah.  What about Bud Trumpet?  All these bands are getting back together.  Like, the new big thing is, like, 90s...  COC?  Alt Rock bands.  Where's COC, motherfucker?  I don't know.  Corrosion.  Dude, COC.  I love...  Play some Corrosion and Conformity, here, Rock.  Toadies shit.  And don't give us a fucking beat track.  But I know, like, you know, like, Soul Asylum's got a new...  Oh, my God.  I never liked Soul Asylum. 
[00:10:00]  I hated them motherfuckers.  I know, uh...  What's the big song by Soul Asylum?  Soul Asylum, they did Runaway Train.  You've heard that.  Runaway Train never came.  That's okay.  I fucking hated Soul Asylum.  That's okay.  It's so fruity.  We have fruity.  We met them a bunch, too.  I know Everclear's got a new record coming out.  What's one of their songs?  Everclear is all right.  They did, um...  Huh?  Father of Mine.  I like this song.  With Santa Monica.  Yeah.  Yeah, but this is just so fruity.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  Like, there were so many rockin' songs when this came out.  This is just...  I used to fucking...  I couldn't punch out of this one fast enough.  Yeah, this is fucking Pussy Boy Rock.  Yeah.  They found a bunch of kids from this music video.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And that was, like, their big...  Their big thing, that this music video actually, you know, found some missing kids.  Whoop-dee-fucking-do.  Well, that's not nice.  I mean, they were doing a good thing.  Yeah, you're right.  I don't like mixing my music with missing kids.  Exactly.  You don't like that.  Do-gooder rock stars?  No.  Yeah.  Keep the missing kids on the fucking milk cartons. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Like, what's that other song, too?  Like, Get Off the Fucking Ledge?  What the fuck was that one?  Oh.  Collective Soul.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was another one.  It stopped suicide.  And who gives a shit?  No, Third Eye Blind.  Oh, that was Third Eye Blind.  Oh.  I was thinking of...  He's something, yeah.  Collective Soul's back, too.  Collective Soul's on tour, I think, with the Gin Blossoms.  It's a whole 90s explosion going on.  Hey, Collective Soul had the fucking song for the Jerky Boys movie, so I have a special  place for them.  I don't know any song that any of these bands have done.  I mean, I'm sure I've heard it, right?  Yeah, you've probably heard them, but they don't, like... 
[00:11:30]  What's one Everclear song?  Father of Mine.  That's it?  Okay, I've heard this song.  No, remember Third Eye Blind, though?  Yeah.  We've had a lot of assholes on this radio show over the years, but that Third Eye Blind guy  is right at the top of the list with Bill Maher.  Really?  He's a cunt.  What a dick.  Remember?  Yeah.  Basically calling us out going, this is the worst interview I've ever fucking done.  And it probably was, but fuck him.  Which one of those songs?  It wasn't that bad.  Third Eye Blind.  Third Eye Blind.  He was pissed that we didn't take it more seriously. 
[00:12:00]  Ugh, this is a semi-charmed life.  Ugh.  This guy thought he was a...  This guy thought he was Jim Morrison.  Yeah.  Oh, you know who else just got back together?  Eve Six.  Eve Six?  Thank God!  Holy shit.  Eve Six.  Who's Eve Six?  Eve Six had one hit, and I...  Yeah.  I forget the name of it.  Are the Nixons getting back together?  The Nixons.  Hey, didn't your chick...  I said that.  Oh, you did.  You brought that one up.  She literally got wet in front of me for the drummer. 
[00:12:30]  At that place that sounded like it was from the Middle East.  What was it called?  The Middle East?  The Middle East.  It was called the Middle East.  It was called the Middle East.  An old rock club in Boston, and Nixons are playing me, and I have to be there, and I  want to fucking go home, and she's flirting with the drummer.  I'm like, I think you might be my chick, so if you are, how about we go fucking home  now?  Painting ass.  And then I just ignored all the opportunities around me.  What a fucking idiot. 
[00:13:00]  How was she flirting with him?  Maybe she just chatted with him.  No.  Oh, my God.  They're all fucking...  You could tell the difference.  This guy here?  The drummer?  I don't know.  No, is this the guy you mean?  Yeah, he was an asshole.  No, this Third Eye Blind, we're playing right now.  Who was the one-shoots flirtler?  The Nixons.  Oh.  They had a song called Sister, which was kind of...  Oh, right.  Oh, that was a big song.  Yeah, that was a big song.  Let me hear it.  I don't know it.  Come on, Eric.  And the record company was very disappointed they couldn't make that band more famous.  They tried everything, remember it? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock's losing his mind right now, trying to find these songs.  Well, I didn't know any Nixons songs.  Oh, really?  This was a big hit.  Why are we doing this?  Because we do this break every six months, and it's fun.  God, is that true?  Oh, I know why, because I'm going to Boston, so it brought back some memories.  Trying to figure out where to go.  It's our AAF shit.  I love the 90s rock breaks.  Yeah.  Do you really?  Yeah.  I remember that guy.  He was actually really cool.  We hung out with him a lot.  The lead singer of the Nixons. 
[00:14:00]  Jimmy, we were right there, man.  No, no, no.  We helped people.  Jimmy, believe me, if I wasn't in the music business when this fucking shit was going on,  I wouldn't know either.  Me and Ann, you're looking at two guys that really helped the 90 music movement.  Oh, man.  We're two guys.  It was crazy.  We're two guys.  I talked to Rob Thomas on Twitter, and he completely remembers that we helped him out in the old days.  They have a new record coming out, too.  He said he's going to come in.  That was that big press event thing we did at Roseland. 
[00:14:30]  Matchbox 20.  Yeah, yeah.  It was at Roseland, yeah.  I ignored the 90s.  I lived in the decade, and I don't know what I had on fucking 80s and 22,000 blinders.  I didn't even look at the fucking 90s.  That's fine.  Jim, you're just getting into the Ramones.  It's totally cool.  The 90s.  Yeah, that's good.  The 90s did fucking rock, though.  There was some fucking music in the 90s.  It was the last good rock decade.  Oh, now you just sound old.  I can't think of any.  Exactly.  Oh, come on.  There's plenty of good rock songs now.  What about the 2000s?  Yeah.  Like two, yeah.  There's Jack White and the Foo Fighters.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Just look at fucking Sam's arms, and you'll find out who's good.  Mr. Rolling Stone.  You talking about that yesterday?  Oh, yes.  You talking about Mr. Rolling Stone?  Rolling Stone.  It doesn't count if they don't say your name, though.  Yeah.  Who cares?  It says Jack White signs an autograph.  Yeah, some androgynous zero.  They never even fucking say that he got it tatted.  Which is the big story.  You should call Rolling Stone and do a follow-up interview.  You should call him and say, dude, I tatted him.  I tatted this shit.  And my name is Sam Roberts, and I want credit before I sue you.  Maybe they'll do a whole feature on you. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll do a whole fucking story on you.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's called Who's This Asshole?  Where's the drummer?  There's the drummer.  There he is.  Oh, man.  Yeah, exactly.  She had the horrible taste.  This is horrendous.  No, I know.  It's funny.  I'm talking about myself, too.  This that you're listening to is Matt Fox 20.  Oh, this is...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but we're still watching the video.  We're watching this.  What about Helmut?  Helmut.  Helmut.  Helmut. 
[00:16:00]  Remember that?  Unsung, I think it was, right?  You want Corrosion of Conformity?  COC.  Bam.  Supposedly they put out an album last month.  Of course they did.  We used to know these guys.  COC got back together.  All these bands get back together and nobody cares.  Nobody cares.  What's a Bush song?  Play Clean My Wounds.  You've heard Bush.  We play Clean My Wounds.  COC.  Glycerine.  Glycerine.  You know Bush.  I'm sure I do.  Little things.  That album was great. 
[00:16:30]  Well, they had a lot of young girls that fucking loved them.  That's all we heard in Centrum was like...  Screaming.  We couldn't even enjoy the fucking music.  It was like fucking tinnitus.  It was just girls screaming for fucking Gavin.  That had to stop, though.  Like, girls still love him.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  What is this?  They were a big band, right?  He's never going to play my COC.  Bush was huge.  Hey, the fucking boss is asking for COC.  That was a moment.  That was a moment.  What?  When he played Glycerine in the rain during MTV Spring Break. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, wow.  That must have been a moment, all right.  Why, people like him?  Too bad he didn't get electrocuted.  Yeah, exactly.  Big deal.  He's fucking...  Was he getting wet or was just the crowd?  The girls were all wet.  Oh, the girls certainly were getting wet in the fucking crowd.  How come it doesn't even rain?  It's vaginal juice getting stirred up from all the squirters in the front row.  Oh, yeah.  I bet you didn't pussies while getting stepped on. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, Jesus, Chip.  What the fuck is that about?  What am I saying?  Can we get COC on the fucking air, please?  Yeah, there it is.  Watch this, we've been asking for it.  Turn this up.  I like that.  Yeah, they put an album on February.  Oh, this fucking rocked.  Yeah, these guys are good.  God damn.  Are we dating ourselves by saying this fucking rocks?  Who gives a shit?  Because I fucking think this still rocks.  Guys.  Great.  I've ever been driving like 150 miles an hour in my fucking cars with this shit. 
[00:18:00]  From that time of working at AAF, this could be my number one.  This was a good one, man.  This was, like, so fucking good.  All right, turn this up.  For the next one. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, you know what I'm thinking of?  I like System of a Down.  This was fucking good.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They just got back together, too.  I didn't even know they broke up.  Yeah, for a while.  This is great.  This is...  This seems like a band that should have survived a little bit.  They're on tour, eh?  They're on tour right now.  Are they?  Of course they are.  They're all coming back.  Just like the 80s guys came back during my...  You know what? 
[00:19:00]  I'm telling you.  If you look at a list of 90s bands that are on tour this summer, it's...  It's huge.  It's like 15 years.  Wow.  So let me bring this back to present day, please.  Ooh.  I want to send out an open invite.  We've got to get the word out to all these fucking guys we used to know and help out back  when we were at AAF.  Want to bring them on the show?  I don't give a fuck.  If we were friends with them and we played them at AAF and they want to come in here...  What if butt trumpet shows up?  Well, then we hear you're ugly.  I don't care.  Hey, Rock, where's some butt trumpet? 
[00:19:30]  You're ugly.  You're ugly.  Were you talking about Middle East and Boston?  Yeah.  That's where Corrosion and Conformity is playing in June.  I thought that place was gone.  Really?  No.  Yeah.  Can't be the original Middle East.  Why not?  No, I think that one survived out of all the rock clubs in Boston.  The rat.  Remember the rat?  That's long gone.  Yeah.  Godsmack, of course.  We just missed Godsmack, though.  We were just leaving town when that all hit.  Yeah, I wouldn't put them in the 90s, though.  That's like late 90s.  Godsmack, we were just starting to play whatever when we were leaving town.  They're part of the whole, like, Linkin Park disturbed. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  I don't love Linkin Park.  My angel loves it.  I don't love them.  Linkin Park?  I like Linkin Park.  I don't.  Their first album was good for what it was.  What is this?  What is this?  C-Rocket.  Oh, yeah.  It says butt trumpet.  What's the name of the song?  I'm ugly and I don't know why.  Oh, does it start like this?  It doesn't.  This was a niche song, but we loved it at AF.  All right, turn this up.  You're ugly.  What the hell do you want to do?  He's just screaming. 
[00:20:30]  You're ugly.  And it's your mom is too.  You're ugly.  Yeah.  This is a Venus and Butthead video.  This is a niche.  Oh, yeah.  I think this is 95 around there.  Yeah, that's it.  Probably.  Every video back then was like, you needed the blurry around the edges.  It had to have slow motion, like black and white old guy staring off into nowhere.  It was like, all the videos looked the same.  They all looked like Nirvana videos. 
[00:21:00]  I'm telling you, everyone's, you know, creaming over Instagram, but it's the Instagram look.  Yes.  That everyone just didn't really pay attention to.  When it was happening back in the mid-90s.  Yeah, every Instagram filter is a 90s video fucking screenshot.  It's the pictures you go through when you're on Instagram trying to figure out what looks good for your picture.  So let's put out the invite in.  Let's see who fucking goes for it.  Yeah.  Travis, how do you do that?  Certainly through Twitter, I think a bunch of our fans could, you know, contact some of these old bands. 
[00:21:30]  We're Stabbing Westward.  Are they fucking playing?  I sure hope so.  I love that song.  Stabbing Westward, E-Rod.  Stabbing Westward.  What song was it?  Oh, shit.  I forgot the name of that one.  Better play their hit, motherfucker.  Save Yourself.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Save Yourself.  Save Yourself, and then they had What Do I Have To Do.  Yeah, Save Yourself.  Save Yourself.  Save Yourself.  That's amazing.  That's a great track.  Yeah.  What band do you think will be the first one to take our invite?  Come in here.  We'll talk to them a little bit.  Let them play whatever the fuck they want.  As long as they play their hit from the 90s as well.  How about Gravity Kills? 
[00:22:00]  I love Gravity Kills.  Guilty.  Yeah, Guilty's a great song.  Okay.  This fucking rocks when it kicks in, too.  Guilty.  We'll just book all of them when they come to New York.  Who's this?  Stabbing Westward.  This is great.  Yeah, yeah.  Are they still together?  I don't know.  This song's 14 years old.  14 years old, this song. 
[00:22:30]  Jesus Christ.  Oh.  Your life is empty and you hate the face of this world of love.  Ooh.  So you're searching for an engine.  Someone who can make you home.  That bass player's really going to go off.  Waiter's still on the rock.  Oh.  I cannot say.  I got a trivia question for Anthony.  Yeah.  Name the three bands that we bought beer for. 
[00:23:00]  Silver Chair.  Correct.  This is true, by the way.  Breaking news right here.  Silver Chair, they were about 16, 17 when they came through.  Yeah, they wanted beer badly.  Underage bands or something.  And they're now in their 30s, which is fucking sad.  Oh, that other one with the singer that turned out to have an attitude.  No, he didn't have an attitude.  Well, he might have got hooked on heroin.  He didn't get along with the rest of the band very well.  Travis Meeks.  Right, yes, yes.  Days of the New is number two.  Days of the New. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God.  That's number two.  Yeah.  And believe it or not, I believe COC.  Oh, shit.  I think the lead singer back then was a lot younger.  Wow.  I believe.  I don't think Stabbing Westford is still together.  Their website hasn't been updated in five years.  Five years?  Is that bad?  Yes.  That's probably not a good sign.  Maybe they're on the Facebook.  Yeah.  Hey, what's the good Travis Meeks song?  Remember we had them in Philly?  Well, Days of the New is amazing.  They were good?  I kind of like Days of the New a lot for a while there.  Can we play one of them, Dolph Face? 
[00:24:00]  Remember he fucked up our whole live gig?  Well, he fucked himself over.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, my God.  We did a whole...  Electric Factory Outlet, that was.  Yeah, we did a huge road show.  It was packed.  We did really well.  And then we went in with Days of the New.  Or Travis Meeks.  I think he was on his own by then.  Yeah.  And he took 20 minutes to fiddle with everything and candles.  Fiddling with lighting candles.  And by the time he hit his first note, most of the place left.  They couldn't wait around any longer. 
[00:24:30]  He should have went on immediately.  Of course.  He had the energy up for him.  Yeah, this fucking song is all right.  Yeah.  I remember this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Listen down to little man.  I'm not the one who's trying to change you.  Yeah.  Every video looks the same.  Yeah.  It all looks the same.  It's either fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah, with the blurry In-N-Out.  This is from the 90s?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  This is 98. 
[00:25:00]  Those days are new.  He's trying to look like Chris Cornell.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I was asking if you guys want Everclear.  Everclear?  Remember Everclear?  Everclear is the first fucking invite.  They're coming by, yeah.  Will they play?  We want these guys to play.  Yeah.  They have to play because no one's going to give a fuck what they have to say.  Maybe Art and Lexus will do some acoustic. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Unless they do what Train did the other day.  Train gave us some great shit.  Train was great.  Train sounded great.  All right.  We'll see if Everclear will come in and play.  They have to play, Roland.  They can play one new song and they have to play one of their hits.  Right.  Yeah.  That's the rules.  That's our rider, motherfuckers.  That's the rules.  What are you saying?  Roland's saying two old and one new, maybe.  No, one and one.  One and one.  That would be one and one.  Forever Clear, yeah.  One and one.  Get the fuck out.  Some other bands will do other combos.  One and one.  A few minutes?  Yeah, right now. 
[00:26:00]  Set up.  Go ahead.  Play.  Let's go.  All right.  We're sending the invite out to all these bands we know and love, especially when we're  at AF.  A lot of these guys came through back then.  The invite is out there.  Come by and say hi.  You know who still loves?  See what you've been up to and play a couple songs for us.  Coke Logic still loves Everclear.  Like, they're the biggest thing in the world today.  Really?  Yeah.  I know that adds up.  He's a 90s dude, though.  Very 90s.  He loves Pearl Jam and he just likes to sit in his house and do whatever Coke Logic does. 
[00:26:30]  He just put out an animation for Bowling to Behave.  Oh, wow.  Get the fuck out.  I still listen to that in my car like it's a real song.  I love that fucking Drew Boogie is here.  It's the greatest fucking song.  Why aren't we promoting the animation if it's out there?  When did it hit?  When did it hit?  Like four hours ago.  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  Wow.  We'll all tweak the shit out of that one.  Looks like David Kell.  Bowling for Behave.  It really is a hit.  Oh, cool.  Go to what?  Coke Logic's Twitter? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  He just posted this?  Yeah.  It's called Bowling for Behave.  It's now animated.  He makes good animations.  Every time I hear it, there's a new favorite part.  Oh.  You know?  Play this.  It works on the radio.  I was so angry.  Yeah.  It was so angry.  Behave.  What is it?  Can't you do?  Why don't you do that?  I like that.  Why don't you do that?  It just doesn't rhyme.  It doesn't go with anything.  It's just in there.  It ain't whitey.  It ain't whitey.  It ain't whitey.  It ain't whitey.  Let's play this.  I am an ass. 
[00:27:30]  Let's play this shit.  Sam, I'll bite your fucking arms.  Hit the play.  Hit the play.  We don't care.  Is there going to be...  Gun crime, things like this, gang-related violence.  It's going to be minority.  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave.  In this game.  There's all these videos of just, like, fucking that store, uh...  Yeah, store surveillance.  Yeah, but...  I'm on the fucking throne. 
[00:28:00]  A throne made of guns.  It ain't whitey.  You didn't understand my home.  No, that's the sword throne from, uh...  A sword throne.  Right, right, right, right.  It ain't whitey.  Look how guns it does.  Fuck.  Make a puppy call.  I'm on it for me.  Fuck.  I'm dancing guns.  I'm dancing guns.  I'm moving.  I'm on it for me.  This is great.  I'm on it for me.  And there's a big word, Behave, well-made, like a one-way show. 
[00:28:30]  Black crime.  Black on white crime.  Go on to the compound.  L.A. gangster, L.A. gangster.  L.A. gangster.  Swipe each other out.  Black on black crime.  Black on white crime.  Fuck it, Behave.  How about you do that?  How about you do that?  How about you do that?  How about you do that?  How about you do that?  Tell me to tell you to hate me.  I'm gonna see you make a movie call me for me.  I'm gonna see you make a movie call me for me.  I'm gonna see you make a movie call me for me.  This is fucking great.  My head is doing the follow the bouncing ball on the words. 
[00:29:00]  Oh.  How about you fucking do that?  Oh, cranky man.  That's so cranky.  I'm gonna see you make a movie call me for me.  That's great.  Ah!  Fucking Coke Logic.  All right, listen.  Great job, man.  We all gotta tweet that shit.  The dancing line of the guns with the faces, that smiley face. 
[00:29:30]  And it says behave in the back like in Broadway letters.  It's like a Broadway show.  Wow.  Listen, it's on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  It's amazing.  Wow.  And Coke Logic on Twitter.  That is funny, man.  We should all retweet that one.  That's amazing.  Holy fuck is that great.  My favorite song, too.  Oh.  Of this show, I think, is that one.  That is a great fucking.  Holy fuck is that.  I don't know how he just heard me yelling and saw a song.  There really isn't.  I don't know how you do that.  Brilliant to that.  Oh, Mike.  Oh. 
[00:30:00]  There we go.  Yeah, it just comes to me.  You know, I hear it and then, you know, I just hear music behind it and I just, I did  two more like that.  Wow.  I got new shit.  I love Drew.  Oh, damn.  I love Drew, but what would be better if the floor opened up and he just fell through?  In the middle of that exclamation.  It's just, you know, I hear something and he just falls.  That is fucking great, man.  It's great.  Do we want Sugar Ray?  Why?  We're being offered Sugar Ray.  That's the 90s band, yeah.  But are we being offered them? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sugar Ray and Everclear are co-headlining a tour.  Oh, wow.  They're doing this thing.  It's Sugar Ray.  Sugar Ray saw it.  I forget.  Oh, they got tons of hits.  I just want to fly.  I forgot.  To be honest with you.  I just want to fly.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That song was huge.  That was big.  It's Sugar Ray, Everclear, Jim Blossoms.  Oh, my God.  But these guys have to play.  It's a great tour.  If they don't play, they're not invited.  If they don't play, they don't come in.  Right.  We set the rules.  That's right.  Yeah.  Huh?  It could just be acoustic though, right?  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  It has to be acoustic.  What do we eat?  No.  We could fucking plug in.  That thing.  Yeah, they can come in and play this.  Yeah.  They want exposure.  Yeah, he's done with his big Access Hollywood career.  They're all going back on tour this summer.  Summer's starting this weekend.  Let's bring them all in.  Whoever wants in, get the word out.  I think we should.  You want the whole lineup in here.  We want the 90s in our show this summer.  We want the 90s in.  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck what festival they're playing.  Right.  It's the summer of the 90s on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:31:30]  They've got to play though.  They've got to play.  A big song.  This is a huge song.  Huge.  I am fucking still.  Would you take Chris Cornell with him?  He won't sing.  He won't sing.  He won't sing.  Motherfucker.  He's got to sing.  He sang once.  My favorite.  Remember when Patrice fell asleep?  No.  Oh my god.  It's like Patrice didn't give a...  Patrice in fairness had said, I'm going to go man.  He just didn't give a fuck about Chris Cornell.  And we're like, no hang out.  Hang out.  And he just sat here in the middle and ruined everything.  He fell asleep. 
[00:32:00]  He fell asleep in front of Chris Cornell.  He fucking just ruined the mood not caring.  Yes.  Because he was bored by the way.  He couldn't have been more bored.  It wasn't because he was tired.  He was so bored because in his world he don't give a fuck about Chris Cornell.  He didn't give a fuck about Chris Cornell.  Chris Cornell is sitting where Sam is.  And we love Chris Cornell.  Trust me on that.  It's just Patrice.  He's just not in Patrice's world.  And he's a big fucking star.  And Patrice didn't give a fuck at all.  Dozed off.  He didn't almost ever fall asleep while he was talking in the room.  That was great.  Right.  I'm still stunned over the dancing Walter PPKs. 
[00:32:30]  It's great.  That is so fucking good.  And it was showing all this, what was it called?  It was all surveillance.  Yeah.  Like a convenience store.  What were they called when they were all running at the same time?  Flash mobs.  Flash mobs.  Flash mobs and beatings outside.  It says behave on the gun.  Oh, it says behave where it's usually Walter.  And they got little eyes.  They're adorable dancing guns.  Yeah.  They're really.  You want to hug them.  And my head is bouncing like the follow the bouncing ball with the words on the bottom.  It's fucking hilarious. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I think that's going to get a few years.  Coke logic is the shit with this stuff, man.  That could go viral, man.  That's too good.  That's a good one.  That could go viral.  That's a good one, man.  Let's get that to go viral.  Some people are a little fat fuck.  It's Michael Moore.  Michael Moore's big fat face.  He was like, who should run with me?  Like Michael Moore takes his walks now.  If you follow his Twitter, every night he takes his walks.  And I'm constantly retweeting him.  He's like, oh, who wants to take a walk with me?  And I just retweet.  I retweet it with a picture of the Grim Reaper. 
[00:33:30]  So you just click on the link and it's the Grim Reaper.  He's the worst.  Oh, it is dumb.  He was talking yesterday.  He tweeted something like, Fox News viewers are the least informed people.  Like when asked questions about domestic and foreign policy, Fox News people will answer like 1.04 out of 5 questions right.  That's the average.  Really? 
[00:34:00]  But then he neglected to say that MSNBC viewers are equally as fucking misinformed.  Of course they are.  But he didn't say that.  Of course they are.  But he didn't say that.  He just mentioned the Fox News ones.  Because they continue that dumb tug of war game.  Of course.  No one's going to ever win.  It has nothing to do with Fox or MSNBC.  People in general are fucking like ill-informed douchebags.  We get it.  Oh, wow.  It looks like Obama has a slight lead over Romney right now. 
[00:34:30]  But what happened?  Because yesterday I read that Romney had the lead.  In some of these key states he's got a big lead.  Oh, this is if he picks certain VPs.  Oh.  So what?  All right.  See, it's Romney Portman.  And then Romney.  Romney Portman's running?  Romney Bush.  Boo.  What's that?  Oh, God.  Boo.  Ugh.  Oof.  He's not going to pick Bush.  Wow.  He's going to get that Rubio guy.  Yeah, that's right.  He needs the Rubio guy.  NBC. 
[00:35:00]  And then Obama goes and gets Clinton.  Oh, and it's an NBC Marist poll, so I don't trust it.  No.  It's fucking lefties.  This guy could get us in touch with Days of the New on the phone if you want.  What?  No.  411.  Sam just put up, do we want Lit or Marcy Playground?  Yes.  I don't know who they are.  Either or or both.  I know Lit.  You could have both.  Oh, wow.  Marcy Playground, sure.  Give us the Lit song.  Give us the Marcy Playground song.  I hated that Marcy Playground song.  I wasn't a big Marcy Playground fan. 
[00:35:30]  You played it though.  I hated this song.  I don't mind this.  We have an MTV thing to show I did with Florentine.  This is one of the videos we watched.  I am.  Yeah.  No, not MTV.  Sex and Candy.  That's right.  Yeah.  Whazzup.  Yeah.  Here's one.  Here's one.  If they perform it live, we'll take them.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Lit has to do my own worst enemy, right?  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thank you, Celine.  To me.  To me.  To me. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, man.  Still my birthday.  Celine.  This is a cool song.  I mean, not cool, but it's all right.  I don't mind this song.  It's all right.  I think I hated it mainly for the video.  The video was just too stupid.  I was out as far as video goes at that point.  I just like the songs.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get Tripping Daisy.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What's the other song?  What's the other song?  Lit.  Lit.  No, no.  This is lit?  This is my worst enemy or whatever.  Yeah.  My own worst enemy? 
[00:36:30]  Right, right.  Right, right.  Birdo.  This is the end of the 90s, though.  Yeah, this is in so many of those 90s teen movies.  Yeah.  Can't hardly wait.  Yeah.  It's kind of like whiny Rockies movie.  I don't care.  If they want to come in and play this, we'll fucking have them.  Yeah, this started getting into that.  I hate this.  I hate this.  This started getting into that shit.  I hate this.  Yeah.  Blah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Shit.  You're gonna ruin our booking.  I don't care.  This stinks.  Please tell me.  Wow. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, this started getting into it.  That's fucking terrible.  This is fucking terrible.  Yeah, this is almost delving into the early thousands.  This is 99, so yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you can tell the way they're...  Yeah, it's a little different.  Yeah, this isn't grunge, yo.  I'm on Seven Mary Three.  All right, we can do that.  Wow, Seven Mary Three.  What the fuck is that?  Cumbersome?  I have become...  What?  I have become...  What?  Yeah.  This isn't grunge, yo.  I'm on Seven Mary Three.  All right, we can do that.  Wow, Seven Mary Three.  What the fuck is that?  Cumbersome?  What?  Who are they?  Seven Mary Three?  I wouldn't know them. 
[00:37:30]  I have become...  Cumbersome.  Cumbersome.  This break should be called...  What happened to you, Jimmy?  Where were you for 10 years?  Dude, I don't know what I did for the 90s, but apparently from fucking December of 89  to fucking until 9-11, I was busy.  You couldn't avoid any of this stuff.  It was everywhere.  I know.  Even if you...  Huh?  No, you go...  I was gonna say whoever was on the Empire Records soundtrack.  Oh, that was good.  Yes.  Yes.  The Empire Records soundtrack.  I really like this dumb song. 
[00:38:00]  Who's gonna make me a mixtape for my ride to Boston?  Oh, man.  Whoever has the biggest crush on you.  Huh?  Whoever has the biggest crush on you.  How about we all contribute?  That's hard to figure out.  We're all put in two songs.  What did Doc Ock have written on his mixtape in fucking Boogie Nights?  His fucking mixtape.  Yeah.  Doc Ock.  He was mad because...  Well, what's his name?  Right, right, right.  Had the Chinese kid fucking throwing firecrackers around.  That was Doc Ock?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  Yeah, that's Doc Ock.  And they're just the most hacky singles.  Oh, it was great. 
[00:38:30]  It wasn't like deep tracks, right?  It was great.  Yeah, Alfred Molina.  I didn't realize that was him.  Yeah, it's Doc Ock and it's also the guy in Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark that  went into the first cave with Indy.  I don't remember.  And he's like putting his fingers together, watching Indy trade the gold head for the  bag of sand.  Oh.  He was real skinny then.  He should get Pro Jam.  You know what's sad?  Pro Jam's not even in this conversation.  I know.  You know what's sad?  I'm checking my Twitter.  A lot of just regular guys. 
[00:39:00]  I'm not trashing anyone.  I'm just saying regular guys.  Like, hey, I know the drum of this band.  I know the singer of this band.  Oh, really?  Really, while I'm on the show, I could get them for you.  I know that guy.  They're all regular guys.  I work with them.  We fucking roof.  Right?  We should get a 90s band in here every Friday.  I would love it.  For the summer.  That'd be great.  What about, uh, Superdrag?  We getting any Candlebox?  Yeah.  Some Candlebox?  I think they're back together.  Of course they are.  Of course they're back together.  Idiots.  Candlebox?  No.  That's a good idea. 
[00:39:30]  Candlebox was alright.  Every Friday have a 90s band in here?  Yeah.  How about, uh, could you give me some Local H, please?  Bounce to the floor.  Local H, wow.  It was Bounce to the floor, I believe.  Oh, Jimmy is boggled by all this.  We played all this for three straight years.  I'm amazed these bands you guys are, like, can pick out and all that.  Oh, yeah.  They all had one really good song.  Eric, how about some Stroke Nine?  Ah, there it is.  The problem with all these bands is they had one good song.  Some of them were able to get a second song out there.  But, in general, they all had the one big song.  Are they all touring together?  I'm getting a few up here.  Remember Better Than Ezra?  Yes! 
[00:40:00]  Come on!  Where's Better Than Ezra right now?  They're still around.  They all had terrible names, these bands.  They're all just shitty 90s band names.  Is the Offspring?  The 90s is a whole thing.  Is the Offspring doing anything?  Is the Offspring doing anything?  Yes.  They're still recording.  They never broke up.  Will they come in and sing Bad Habit?  Could you put on a little Monster Magnet for me?  Nice.  One of those guys, my friend was friends with those guys.  Monster Magnet.  And one of those guys worked at the Stress Factory.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of like those guys.  The Monster Magnet guys?  Yeah.  Play the Monster Magnet song.  I actually still really like that song to this day.  Which one is that? 
[00:40:30]  Uh, fuck.  Space Lord?  Space Lord.  Fuck this.  Yeah.  Fuck Local Age.  Are they from the 90s?  Yeah.  Listen to this fucking song when it kicks in.  We talked to him.  Oh, yeah.

Space Lord Mother.  I'm not going to see him anymore.  I'm not going to see him anymore.  There's a little grease up your baby for a ball on the hill.

[00:48:30]  when my life was sucking in boston my personal life yeah i would drive home from gigs and this  would come on the radio and i would be very happy this one would get me start singing right here yeah  this one would get me through some fucking oh yeah some fucking lonely nights this is a guitar that's  crystal everybody thought they were so fucking cool in the 90s yeah everyone was cool in the 90s

[00:50:00]  the rest of the song can go it's own i just want an ipod link of that part  about sponge we do sponge sponge had a couple all right we did this break already didn't we we've  done this break every year for the last seven years yeah we have and we'll do it again in six  months this break seems a bit familiar it's our memorial today weekend it's starting to feel  familiar people calling in they love it they do just keep playing that the guy from space 
[00:50:30]  hog married live tyler oh okay why i was gonna say that but okay all right fair enough  what about uh you think she uh is realizing that was a mistake yeah oh fuck i thought you'd be a  huge rock star like my daddy happen i guess arosmith did a new song on idol last night yeah hey how  was it forget this 90s stuff it's all about moving to the future how was the new arson song 
[00:51:00]  oh you know what they played last night oh too much going on because cake did war pigs you know  that right oh yeah we played that before i never heard it were you here i might have been busy at  pop locking at the time did you give jimmy a little uh war pigs by cake i'm telling the cake is a  really good bit yeah i agree i like the one cover we can try and get them in when they're in town i  would love to get a cake in here we're gonna have a busy summer no one's gonna take us up on our invites  well they're all busy working well come on through let's do this just like which is that black 
[00:51:30]  massive you don't like this this guy's fucking sting singing style do you really reluctantly  crouch at the starting line i hate it i hate the cake  we're forgetting one great song man it sounds like danny's we're forgetting more than one great  something that's not like danny's version that is true oh damn honey we're forgetting 
[00:52:00]  pendulum by foundry are they together are they touring he thought it was gonna be big  he remixed it in everything he thought that's fire i love it i love his new mix yeah because it's  not him yeah yeah yeah but he was like he was 15 years too late how do you miss my 15 years 
[00:52:30]  yeah one of my favorite moments is when he sang this live oh it's  fucking great now there's another version with the guy uh yeah where he uh replaced himself with  a real singer it's actually a really good song you're talking about when he gave the song to  another band yeah i like that except maybe they can make it a hit what's the other band i played on  my bongo show i like this the only thing i don't like is there's like a little weird vibrating sound  in there like this sounds like when vanilla ice made his like metal album oh yeah right 
[00:53:00]  oh yeah this is good though oh words are so bad yeah condensation  now it's like dara sound like fucking stairway to heaven this is good though this version  yeah i like this man yeah steve's voice has been taking off of it so the only weakness is the writing  yeah which is the only part that steve with steam push me one more 
[00:53:30]  that's fucking great  you don't like that i like the original better i just don't like that  it's like someone has a piece of metal and they're waving it this song could almost work  in the mid 90s i'm telling you in the mid 90s that's kind of a novelty type of  let's get out of my what's the live version sound like  did you like that i like the original version this is what he did live on our 
[00:54:00]  show this is so just hang over the track on  fucking plug this is great  yeah our old producer steve's story tell our listeners this is  steve's story  attention just another day another condescension  mock you shock you it's gonna lock you down  oh my god this is so loud  pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure  move too slow and the pendulum will get you 
[00:54:30]  throw you low you it's gonna throw you around  yeah here we go  you did the crime and not the time now you got a baby what you've done you better run  how about all i can take of all you're screaming in my ear  come back you're gonna break if you push me one more  are you embarrassed that oh this is terrible  heart's getting heavy my blood's getting cold  you change me into something that i just can't control  if you see me coming best get out of my way 
[00:55:00]  the vangelum is swinging back the other way  oh you're johnny bravo he's rocking yeah he's johnny bravo  oh you guys are all big liars  i uh wow i have a correction i have a correction before we go to break  remember that whole space hog uh in the meantime thing yeah it was actually hum hum oh that this  guy in philly is all about everything hum has ever done i only knew the one song stars right and 
[00:55:30]  that's the one that got me through some lonely nights i got i got that song you didn't like  that's a great song you didn't like stars by home it's  fucking gimmicky with the big intro  i fucked up that whole thing but supposedly supposedly they got other great songs at this  guy ray in philly he just he has everything they've ever done  oh yeah yeah it wasn't space hog i fucked that up remember this you see me coming best get out of my  wife now i'm gonna be on my track that was the best yeah it's really good 
[00:56:00]  hit that guitar she thinks no it's good i hate this it's a 90s video  yes it doesn't look like kurt cobain they all tried to look like look he's trying to look like  kurt man roan's offering the spin doctors and saying they've been trying to come in for a while  oh god we had him in a million times right you get it your answer out loud this is a great song  i like this one yeah do you think it stinks yeah i never liked it in this song 
[00:56:30]  listen to that sustain put one that down go have a bite you come back you're still  hearing that one i want to see that movie it smells up yeah  no not feeling it yes all right so that brings us uh to last night

[00:57:30]  weird oh i hate this you don't like this no what about when it kicks in no how's it going to kick  sing a lot of these songs had a kick in yeah this is like home stars where it starts off slower and  kicks in the 90s was the kick in decade yeah you're right the kick in decade as opposed to the kick  balls decade right travis yeah well maybe yeah that was a fun game i never played too good  kickball i would always know they call me strike out king and they'll call me a kickball 
[00:58:00]  here we go here we go here we go kick in  i swear to god i thought this was fucking uh what was lane staley's band  i thought this was a good song yeah i liked it i liked it what year is this guys 
[00:58:30]  what year 98 no this is before 98 97 oh man yeah oh no we're in af so 95 96 probably 95 i guess  you're right it's a big song right aerosmith last night american idol do you like the song pink by  aerosmith pink like the bing in your cherry right bro that's steve oh that's a funny  if you see my car 
[00:59:00]  yeah did you rock in there just sweating and pressing yeah well freaking out it passed me by  but someone goes this is the most workout he rock has gotten in years do you think uh you've done that  joke as many times you've done this bit why how did you trip on it that was a good one if you didn't  trip on it clumsy oh my god as messy as messy times and go to messy times as you fit good one out of  breath you're talking over the song oh sorry yeah we're hitting the post people like this is the 
[00:59:30]  soundtrack of my youth man you think joe perry wanted to hang himself under a tape in this  that's what's happening you discover  oh horrendous you don't like that line i don't think i like anything less on the planet than that  line we could do a break uh worst uh song lyrics ever fuck man that's what we got to do all sinatra

[01:01:30]  well aerosmith i guess was uh the finale of american idol last night yeah uh people saying that  it was barely uh it was barely live they were playing over a lot of tracks and  shit oh were they sounded like that could have been and steven tyler looks like he can't sing  without his teeth possibly falling out oh that's coming in possibility wow all right well their new  song is called legendary child let's listen i i have no idea i did not hear this yet i've been waiting 
[01:02:00]  for two years to say this ladies and gentlemen aerosmith  um  oh 
[01:02:30]  Was that a Toys in the Attic reference?  Are they singing about their careers? 
[01:03:00]  We were 17 and then there's Toys and what?  But we didn't have any luck.  I think it was sort of the references that Jim did in the We're Back song.  And the Twisted Sisters.  Oh, no.  Is Toys in the Attic one of their songs?  Yes.  That's a record.  We traded our toys for other Joys.  What Sepplin song is that?  Oh, no.  Oh, is that kind of reflecting on their career?  Nothing worse than a reflecting rock song. 
[01:03:30]  Come on, fuckers.  Tell me.  Are you Twisted Sisters?  The new one?  I actually like that.  Pushing 40.  No, it's fucking something 40 on the other side of 40.  What was that called?  Over the go.  Over the go?  Over the go. 
[01:04:00]  Over the go!  The reviews are not good.  People are saying that Joe Perry was singing a completely different song last night.  Was he?  Oh, yeah, it's Walk This Way, okay. 
[01:04:30]  Studio track probably sounds good.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But Walk This Way kind of had that separate feel to it, didn't it?  Yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  What the fuck?  So it's like we're back and better than ever?  Yeah, that's kind of...  I don't know.  We don't have to play the rest of that.  Yeah, I mean, they're all finished.  Aerosmith is done what they came to do.  Yeah.  They're all done.  Look at you, just dismissing them.  You could leave now.  Yeah, we're finished.  We're finished with you.  Well, that was fun.  That was fun.  Yeah.  Another look back.  We'll see you next year with the same break. 
[01:05:00]  Why not?  Yeah, fucking E-Rock.  Do you have your really good Opie Slam?  You fucking had him in your sights and you fucking sneezed and shot the floor.  You had me dead in the water.  Oh, man, you missed.  You fucking missed.  You called him fat fuck.  Oh, sorry.  Do you have that E-Rock?  That was funny.  No, I didn't have it isolated yet.  We got to go to break.  We got to go to break.  We got Drew Boogie in studio because we're going to take a couple of days off for the 
[01:05:30]  big Memorial Day weekend.  And we love the pre-vacation Drew Boogie in studio.  Yes.  What are we taking?  Tomorrow and Monday.  Jimmy said he doesn't like it.  Tomorrow and Monday.  We'll be back live Tuesday.  Yeah.  Drew, what do you got for us going in a break?  How are you, buddy?  I'm very good.  I got a new album, brother.  Oh, shit.  It's called Radio Gold.  Really?  On iTunes now.  Go get it.  On iTunes?  I bought your other record.  Oh, thank you.  I did buy it. 
[01:06:00]  What is it?  It's all auto-tune stuff of references of this show.  Nice.  It's a beautiful thing.  I want to hear this shit.  Oh, you'll hear it.  For sure.  Boy, I can't wait to get my lawyer after you.  Did you find a power thing for your...  Yes.  Yes.  Nice.  Sal is my savior.  I'm good for the show.  Nice.  All good.  Drew is going to play us the break, man.  Drew Boogie, this is off your latest album?  Yes.  Radio Gold.  Go to iTunes.  We had a very, very heavy rotation. 
[01:06:30]  We had a very heavy, a heavy rotation.  We had a very heavy, a...  Three, two, three, two, three... 
[01:07:00]  Two, three, three.  Three, four, three.  It's, um, the Opie Retri Show. 
[01:07:30]  I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate this client, I hate this client, I hate this client.  Ah, we got Drew Boogie live in studio today.  The circus music. 
[01:08:00]  Brings that together.  Oh, man.  New CD called Radio Gold.  It's on iTunes.  Yes.  What are you on Twitter?  Drew Boogie?  Yeah, Drew Boogie on Twitter.  I got a website.  DrewBoogieRocks.com.  Make it easy for people.  DrewBoogieRocks.com.  Nice.  And you spell Drew Boogie D-R-U.  Yes, exactly.  I know that.  Don't be stupid.  I know that shit.  We'll have Drew Boogie doing some more in a little bit here.  That's a fucking good one.  I like it.  It's fucking demonic sounding.  It's very.  That evil circus music. 
[01:08:30]  I miss wished me a happy birthday yesterday.  We got the clip.  Uh, y'all.  Uh-oh.  This morning, it's Obama 47, President Obama, leading Mitt Romney 47 to 43 percent.  Hey, by the way, happy birthday to my buddy Greg Hughes.  This is Opie.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  A great, great guy.  Really?  And wonderful talent.  That's shocking.  Opie and Anthony.  Very nice.  Anthony, a little under the weather, dude.  He's back now.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he is.  Yeah.  Anyway, I love both of them to death.  And they're great guys. 
[01:09:00]  And it's a terrific show.  And I'm happy for Opie.  He's, Opie is 14 years old today.  All right.  So, or something like that.  Anyway, he's a good guy.  Happy birthday.  All right.  Big election today.  Iman is in Egypt.  Hey, right on, man.  Look at that.  Thank you, Imus.  That was nice.  They put your picture up on the screen.  Was it a good picture?  No, it was the one with your giraffe neck.  Oh, Jesus.  Fuck.  Where's that fucking guy?  I want to strangle him.  Well, he could strangle you.  No shit.  Like choking up on a bat. 
[01:09:30]  No, no.  I got this.  I know how to Photoshop.  Now I'm stuck with that fucking picture.  Yeah.  Well, better that one than me with the Ronald Reagan makeup on.  Yes.  Hello.  It's the worst photo shoot we've ever done.  It was terrible.  And then the guy.  That guy stunk.  And I begged him.  And then he goes, no, I got this.  And then he liked your look.  I know we've done this break, too.  And he goes, no, I'm just going to open your eyes and Photoshop.  So I look like a psychopath.  You can't try it.  I'm telling you.  You can't keep your eyes wide open and smile at the same time. 
[01:10:00]  It's almost impossible.  Eyes are wide open.  But guess what?  Through the magic of Photoshop, you could do that.  It was really the worst Photoshopping job ever.  Oh, wow.  Radio Gold, Drew Boogie.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Sam talked to, is he an arch nemesis?  Or is he a, what would you call Gene Simmons?  I don't know.  Besides an asshole.  Yeah, I don't know how Anthony feels about him, but I guess I do now.  Cum guzzler.  And certainly doesn't like him more than me, but I don't like him either, man. 
[01:10:30]  He's just an idiot.  I think he's funny.  He's so full of himself.  He still hasn't gotten over the distraction thing, by the way.  Last time he was in here when he put his hand over Danny's hand because he was typing while  he was talking.  Yeah.  Yesterday when I was talking to him, his guy and Spencer the talent booker would just like  kind of whisper something.  And I couldn't even hear them in my headphones.  But Gene Simmons, every single time, if they whispered while he was talking, would make  reference to the fact that there was whispering or coughing or whatever it was going on in 
[01:11:00]  the studio while he was speaking.  Oh, who cares?  He's so important.  Every word has to be heard without the click clack of a fucking keyboard.  Yeah.  He's famous because he wore clown makeup.  Shut the fuck up.  You wore wacky clown makeup.  Right.  And sang a few forgettable songs.  Goofy, catchy songs.  Shut up.  You know, I didn't realize until I went to see Kiss at that time how few fucking songs  they really have that I knew.  Really?  It was like three songs. 
[01:11:30]  Rock and roll all night?  Yeah.  That one fucking, like Beth, which isn't even really a fucking Kiss song.  Strutter?  No.  Not really, not so much.  No.  We know it, but not so much.  It's like, you think they have a bunch of songs, but it was just, no, they don't.  Let's call them a one-hit-out-loud.  We're going to call them a one-hit-wonder.  One-hit-wonder.  Detroit Rock City.  Kiss.  One-hit-wonder.  Sorry.  One-hit-wonder.  Beth.  Yeah, well, that was like, you know.  And Gene's pissed off that he had nothing to do with that song, by the way.  Gene.  How could I capitalize on that? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, remember?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Remember?  No.  Do we have that break?  I don't know if we just have it at our fingertips.  He twisted and said, well, actually, uh...  Actually, I was the one that came up with the name Beth.  Before that, it was going to be Gene.  It was going to be Gene.  Shut up.  And it didn't rhyme, so I said, let's try Beth.  So it wasn't.  What a dickbag.  No, it wasn't.  And, of course, Dr. Gay.  That's right.  That song, but that's like a, you know, niche-y song.  Dr. Gay.  Jimmy, you might want to take the next ten minutes off. 
[01:12:30]  We're trashing one of your heroes again.  Who?  Gene Simmons.  Gene, of course.  Why?  What happened?  Sam got to finally talk to him about the incident.  Oh, he was here.  Yeah, him and Shannon Tweed Simmons.  Yesterday?  Yesterday afternoon.  Why were they here?  Well, I'm promoting my family jewels.  That's right.  What I'm going to do is act like I'm angry about something, and then it gets resolved.  Really?  Is that it?  His reality show is coming back. 
[01:13:00]  Did he announce that he's the biggest hypocrite going, where he laughed at everybody about  being married?  The new thing now is that...  He would go around the room, you married, and then if you said yes, he would laugh and  go, you're the stuporst person alive, and then in the end, he ends up getting married?  The new thing now is Shannon's mad at him because she found out he was cheating on her,  especially after the internet sex tape came out.  Ooh, look out.  But they're married now.  They're wild, those two.  They are wild.  Yeah, I can't get into that show.  So you got to talk to Jean? 
[01:13:30]  And Shannon.  Oh, really?  She had to come along?  Yeah.  I was glad she was there, though.  I like Shannon, too.  How does she look up close with all that plastic surgery?  Oh, man.  She still looks good.  Be honest.  Be honest.  I've always thought she looked good.  She's a little long in the tooth, as I say.  She used to be really good looking, but she had too much plastic surgery.  Some of these broads have too much surgery.  Yeah.  She didn't look actually overdone in person.  I mean, she's older.  I wouldn't, you know, she's not in my age range.  Jean Simmons had way too much fucking plastic surgery, too. 
[01:14:00]  Jean Simmons is always not.  Jean Simmons is a character.  I just had my eyes done.  That's all I had done were my eyes.  Oh, yeah.  It looks like he's wearing a mask.  It really does.  Nothing moves on his face.  No.  How'd he look?  He has sunglasses on, but, you know, his hair looks ridiculous.  But his hair looks ridiculous.  That's coming from you.  Yeah.  No, but at least it still looks like hair.  On Jean Simmons, it's the consistency of, like, cotton candy.  It looks like dirty cotton candy. 
[01:14:30]  Horrible.  Did you have him on the after show?  No, no, no.  I did.  I taped him for this Sunday show.  I'm going to air it on Sunday.  I'm bummed that I wanted him on my Boneyard show.  Really?  What time did you talk to him?  It was probably 12.  Oh, okay.  Was he nice to you?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a great interview.  Yeah?  Great.  Great, huh?  Great.  I enjoyed my time with him.  You're saying great.  I always have, too.  Of course, everything you do is great, right?  No, not everything.  But this, I mean, compared to my other interviews, I'm very happy with this one.  They're all great.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  I don't know if they're all great.  Everything I do is great.  I was listening to the after show yesterday as I was driving home.  That's great.  I can't remember one thing.  Well, Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa were on.  Oh, right.  That's why.  Don't bring them down.  Why would you say such terrible things about Bob and Joe?  You know why?  Because I just equate it to the show.  Right.  Like, it was so different.  It wasn't the after show.  Usually, you know, it's Troy Kwan comes in.  You know.  You bash Iraq a little.  Iraq tries to sound like he's your co-host. 
[01:15:30]  Failing miserably.  Did you find what I wanted you to find, Iraq?  Yes, I did.  His shoes?  His shoes.  You know, it's hard to find.  Yeah, I know.  I understand.  I agree.  He was so dejected that you remembered that you asked for it.  What is it?  His fuck up?  When he tried to slam you and he had you.  He had you.  Oh, God.  Oh, can we hear this?  Yeah, me bad.  Oh, I can hear this.  It passed me by, but someone goes, this is the most workout Iraq has gotten in years.  Do you think, uh... 
[01:16:00]  You've done that joke as many times as you've done this video.  Iraq has met a few of thoughts.  Has met times a few of them.  Wow.  Well, here's Sam talking to Gene about the incident.  Yeah.  What's going on between you and Anthony from Opie and Anthony?  There was some rivalry and you haven't been back on the show in a couple years at this point. 
[01:16:30]  I'll go on.  I have no idea.  You don't have anything going on with that?  I don't even know who he is.  Which one is...  I know Opie and Anthony, but I don't know who this guy is.  Well, I think it was...  The last time he came on was when he was dating the weather girl from Channel 11.  Oh, is that somebody you dated?  No, he didn't date her, but he made some kind of remarks about her and Anthony didn't realize  that you had seen her earlier in the day.  I have no idea.  You do not?  Happy to go on the show.  No?  You would be.  Somebody you stripped.  Not that I know of.  I don't believe that he slept with her, but I wasn't present in the moment, so... 
[01:17:00]  I was trying.  Happy to go...  Is this an invitation to be on the show?  Well, I'd have to ask them, but I would love to see you back on the show.  No.  Okay.  Who's the A&E guy?  Why did he have a problem with it?  Well, what happened was Gene said something, you know, jokingly about, you know, stealing  his girlfriend or something.  Wasn't a joke.  And Ant took it as a joke.  Is that the girlfriend?  As it was intended.  Ant didn't realize that earlier in the day, Gene had been on Channel 11 and had talked  to Jill Nicolini, the traffic girl. 
[01:17:30]  And that is his girlfriend?  And knew who Anthony's girlfriend was at the time, when he said it.  You know what I mean?  So I...  How did you know?  I'm not a clue.  I don't even know what we're talking about, but I'd be happy to talk to anybody about it.  Sure.  Okay, good.  Well, I wanted to send that information there.  Which one is Opie, the short one or the tall one?  Gene hit on all women and probably didn't know that was his girlfriend.  Not a clue.  That's fair.  My guess.  Opie's the blonde one and Anthony's the one who looks Italian.  Which one's the taller one?  Because they both stand nice.  Oh, the Italian guy.  Yes.  Right.  Anthony.  So which one's the one that's angry? 
[01:18:00]  Well, I believe at one...  I don't know if he's still angry.  He's probably gotten over it, but...  No.  The Italian guy?  Anthony.  The Italian guy.  No.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure he's over it at this point, but...  Anthony.  No.  You're not over it?  I do believe that he doesn't remember the incident, though.  Yeah, you should have him on and hash it out.  I'm a very important, busy man.  Many things happen in my life where I can't remember things like that.  But he knew who was who.  When he started doing the I don't know who's who thing.  You didn't explain the incident properly.  No.  Well, I mean, I didn't want to... 
[01:18:30]  You were trying to be respectful for the Shannon suit and embarrass her.  Right.  Fuck that.  Oh, fuck that.  I would explain the incident.  I didn't want to completely speak for Anthony.  I say you get him in here and hash it out.  Yeah, absolutely.  Hit on Jill Nicolini that day.  He might apologize to you.  You know, it's...  He was hitting on her.  She had said, because she knew he was coming over here after, she had said that, oh, yeah,  you're going to be doing my boyfriend's show after this.  And he's like, oh, what's that?  What's that?  Oh, Opie and Anthony.  It's Anthony.  It's my boyfriend.  She said this. 
[01:19:00]  And he's like, oh, well, why don't we go out tonight?  I'll take you to dinner and fuck you.  And then he like pinned her against the wall in the office.  And she's like, you know, actually had to get help from some of the fucking people around  the office.  Yes.  Are you exaggerating this?  No.  Because I remember all the other news people saying to her like, are you okay?  Like it was that fucking like blatant.  And then he came over to do our show and he tried to make it seem like nothing had happened. 
[01:19:30]  And he was taunting me with it.  Right.  He was joking, knowing what he had done earlier and thinking that he had made this big conquest.  My cock.  But see, I can't go into it with that amount of detail because I'm not you.  You got to have him on and be like, fuck you, dude.  You could say that again.  You know?  You should have done it.  Yes.  You should have done it, Sam.  I don't know.  I can't.  I can't speak for it.  I think we should have him on.  I don't remember.  I think Ant should fucking, I don't want to see Gene get beat up.  But I think Ant should.  Why would I?  You know why?  You know why?  No. 
[01:20:00]  Because I know it would happen.  And he'd come in.  I'd try to explain it.  And he'd be like, I don't even know what this is.  But let me tell you, I have a new book out that I want to be.  And it would just turn into a fucking Gene Simmons plug fest and nothing would get resolved.  And I would help him plug.  Oh, of course you would.  Look, I know you love him, Jimmy, and I love you.  I know.  But I can't fucking stand that cocksucker.  I understand.  I say no way.  I'm done with that asshole.  I mean, if I thought we would actually have a conversation about it, I'd be fine. 
[01:20:30]  I'll bet he wouldn't be.  He wouldn't fucking entertain it.  I'll bet he would apologize.  He probably would.  And that would, like, diffuse the whole thing.  And then he'd start plugging.  Plus, I spent, like, the first 15 minutes before that question asking him about Shannon  finding out that he was cheating on her for years.  So the vibe in the room was already there.  And he would apologize, but it would be like, well, I'm very sorry if you were upset by that.  Which isn't an apology.  If you were.  Oh, I don't remember it, but if you're still upset about something that happened years ago, 
[01:21:00]  I would apologize.  Did you tell that I'm still a fan?  I didn't mention your name.  I didn't want even for you to be associated with that at all.  Thank you, Sam.  Good call.  Any negative, you know.  Enough of him.  Then he had this to say.  What does Opie and Tony think about?  Opie and?  Oh, you know their names.  Anthony, oh.  You know their names.  You are very bright.  I know what you're doing.  You know their names.  You're very bright.  Wow.  And good looking, too.  Gene.  You are going to be popular in jail.  I'm telling you this.  I'm not going to jail anytime soon.  Oh, okay. 
[01:21:30]  Looks like he wants to fuck you.  Maybe he does.  Let him.  It's Gene Simmons.  Fucking thank God of thunder.  Open your fucking asshole for him.  What are you doing?  Teasing Gene.  I like Gene Simmons.  Me and you both.  I think he's hilarious.  I don't like what he did to you.  Listen to how hilarious I am.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  It was me and another Jew.  All right.  We get it.  Clown makeup guy. 
[01:22:00]  I like fucking clown makeup and big shoes.  Hey, hey, hey.  And two hit songs.  We have more than two.  Fuck, Gene Simmons.  Rock and roll and light and party every day.  Come on.  We're giving him two hit songs, Sam.  Strutter was a hint.  Nope.  Rock and roll and light and party every day.  Detroit Rock City.  Detroit Rock City?  Nope.  That's a big song.  Beth.  And that's it.  Beth was a massive hit.  And he came up with the name for that song?  Yeah, how'd it go?  Because he said that it was...  What do you mean?  The name of the girl was different.  He's like, it's not going to work.  We've got to change this to Beth.  No, I'll come up with a name for the song, and I'll give you full credit. 
[01:22:30]  How you could see him saying that, right?  Right, right.  No.  No.  Shout it out loud.  Shout it.  Shout it.  Shout it out loud.  You've got to have a party.  Yeah.  We're doing a duet.  We sure are.  Dr. Love.  Yeah.  Fucking great tune.  Dr. Gay.  Yeah.  They call him Dr. Gay.  Yes.  Dr. Gay. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  How we doing?  My voice is still kind of funny.  I like Kiss.  I love that he did fucking...  He did Great Expectations, which was a very good song.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Off of Destroyer.  I kind of like his sex tape.  What'd you say?  He fucks like an old lion?  It looks like an old lion on the Serengeti.  When you see an old lion fucking, and they got the underslung ass, and he's just going...  That's how Gene was fucking.  Like an old lion. 
[01:23:30]  Palmer Square says it was Beck.  What?  Oh!  Was it Beck as in Becky?  As in Becky.  I think it was.  I think that's what he said it was.  It was Beck.  I hear you calling.  And Gene said...  Beck?  No.  And Gene goes, no.  It's not going to work.  Everyone's going to think you're in love with Jeff Beck.  No.  He changed it to Beth.  And that's why it's a hit.  That's the only reason that song is a hit.  Why don't you come to my hotel and we'll fuck?  Didn't say that?  No.  My favorite part of this whole scenario is that I said Ant might be over it because 
[01:24:00]  I wanted to give you the option of like, no, I don't want him to think it still bothers  me.  But you immediately went, nope.  No.  Not over it.  Never over it.  Good for you.  Fuck him.  I just wanted to do Kiss songs now all day.  No.  No.  Kiss is a good band.  They're fucking great.  No.  Making Love.  Fucking Take Me.  Yeah.  Paul Stanley songs, but...  And it has nothing to do with Jill either.  Like, I could give a shit.  You just hate that fucking...  He was trying to fuck me over.  He was alpha-mailing you. 
[01:24:30]  He was trying to alpha-mail and fucking cuck me.  In your house.  In my fucking house.  Exactly.  In my fucking house.  He was trying to fuck me over like that and make me look the fool.  I wasn't going to take that.  And you know what?  In that moment, he did because you didn't know the scenario.  I didn't know the scenario, so I'm fucking joking around with him and he's looking at  me like, oh, I had your chick pinned against the fucking wall in the studios of PIX11.  That would bother me.  It did bother me.  I mean, if she didn't fuck him.  Oh.  It would bother me. 
[01:25:00]  If my girl didn't fuck Gene, I'd be very angry at her.  You asshole.  Were you mad when Gene didn't share your banana with her?  Oh, God.  I even got it on that one.  That was so uncomfortable.  Yes, I was.  You got that clip.  We can share it if you want.  We can share it if you want.  Oh.  I know.  This is almost a worst of today.  Yeah, yeah.  We did this bit as well, but fuck it.  This is so douchey.  You got that clip, Jimmy?  It is very douchey.  Yes, it is.  What?  He wanted a little piece of your banana because he was a little hungry? 
[01:25:30]  No, he wanted the banana.  He was like, are you going to eat that?  And Jimmy was like, no, you can have it.  Actually, we can share it if you want.  Did I say that?  Yeah.  So Jimmy could say, like, later on at some point, he'd be like, you know, no, I shared  a banana with Gene Simmons.  Dude, if he would have eaten one, I would have eaten the other until our lips met.  Do you have that banana peel somewhere?  No.  You sure?  I do not, no.  I don't save stuff like that.  Oh, that is great.  Iraq found the clip.  How was it?  I got to be, because, you know, Roast and Gene was, you know, you say. 
[01:26:00]  Can I take a bite?  Sure, you can have the whole thing.  I'll actually share it with you if you want.  Just wanting that connection.  Yeah.  You got a personal touch.  I'll just share it with you if you want.  Like, he was like, okay, I'll compromise and take the whole thing, but I'd really rather  share it with you.  I'll share it with you if you want.  You're going to say, when the God of Thunder wants some banana, you give him some.  The God of Thunder?  Have some banana, buddy.  The God of Thunder.  That's great.  That is so good.  I'd love to share a banana with Gene.  Would you? 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  How many people get to share a banana with their childhood hero?  Not many.  You don't get to.  Would you get Gene Simmons autographed tattooed on?  No.  I've got them to sign everything I want them to sign.  You would do an Aussie tattoo, though.  No, I wouldn't do any of that at this point.  But I got to slam Gene in a roast.  That was great.  Yeah.  I fucking really smashed him.  Why are you touching yourself?  I'm fucking, I got a fucking half a rod.  You got a rod again?  A half a rod.  Why?  It went away.  You were really, oh yeah, okay.  It's a little weird.  You were really tenting yesterday.  I know.  Holy shit. 
[01:27:00]  You stood up yesterday.  And we weren't even talking about anything really sexual at that point.  When you stood up and like, just had the big fucking rod.  Why were you tenting, Jimmy?  I don't remember.  This happens.  Sometimes the seat feels good on my head.  While the Gene Simmons clip was on, Jim looked at me and pointed at his cross.  Yeah.  I pointed at my penis.  And it jumped a little.  Why do you need people to know?  That's just silly.  I don't understand that part.  It's just a practical joke.  Yeah.  Just a couple guys goofing, Sam.  He'll just stand up and point at his dick.  And he'll just be poking out. 
[01:27:30]  Hilarious.  Why not?  Drew, why don't you take us back to break?  Because we went way too long that first break.  So water under the bridge with Gene Simmons?  All good?  Yeah.  No.  What?  Fuck him.  Oh.  Fuck him.  Sorry.  He spit blood and fucking breathed.  Firehouse?  Come on, man.  Not even for Don Kirshner's Rock Hussard Firehouse?  One hit wonder?  No.  Many hits.  We'll give them two.  We'll give them two.  Those fucking dragon boots.  They're one of the biggest bands of all time.  I went to the Kiss show and I realized how little, how few songs I really even knew. 
[01:28:00]  When did you go?  I don't know.  Ten years ago.  Last time they were.  Was that like ten years ago?  Probably at this point.  Jesus Christ.  Last time they were at the Garden?  No.  That's probably ten years ago.  That's probably 2002 or 2003.  Wow.  What about I Was Made For Loving You?  That's a good song.  No.  It's a good song.  That's a great song.  That's their disco era.  It's still a good song.  It's a disco song.  I was made for 12th Dynasty.  Made for lovin' you, baby.  Lick it up.  Oh, I thought that was the Bay City Rollers.  Made for lovin' me.  Ah, the Bay City Rollers.  2000 Man's a great tune.  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y. 
[01:28:30]  It's a safe fucking band.  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  They ripped off the Bay City Rollers.  And what was 2000 Man's a great song by Ace Frehley?  Ace probably became my favorite member.  Really?  Fucking.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Ace was the coolest.  Paul's coming out.  Yes, he was.  With his chest hair.  Sure.  Oh.  Dang.  Jesus.  I was made for lovin' you.  Yeah, it's so small.  This is their disco song, right?  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Drum machine.  You know, bass drum machine.  Very simple guitar.  Yeah.  It's a good tune.  Come on.  Is it?  Yes.  Yeah, dude.  This is a montage song.  Who are you kidding?  Da, da, da, da.  It's a montage.  It's a montage song.  There's so much I want to do.  Yeah.  And then when the hook kicks in.  This is 79.  Shut up, Sam.  I like it.  I like it.  Sam doesn't like it, but I do.  I do like it.  I want to see it kick in. 
[01:29:30]  It's got to kick in.  Made for me.  Here we go.  I was made for lovin' you, baby.  You were made for lovin' you.  No.  Boring.  Yeah.  I want to see it.  No, no.  Don't hit the clip, too, because I can't hear the song.  Okay, fuck it.  What's that? 
[01:30:00]  No, you're getting the buttons.  I can't hear the song.  Oh.  Ah, what the Christ.  I hate you.  Make it all come true.  Oh, shut up.  Turn us off.  This is Paul.  Yay.  I want to hear Drew Boogie.  Yeah.  Radio Gold is the new CD on iTunes.  Drew Boogie.  No, I love the big side.  No, I love the big side.  No, I love the big side.  No, I love the big side.  It's a tender as a rose when it's a solid, as a rock. 
[01:30:30]  No, I love the big side.  Big side.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  You feel the passion for me.  And you don't want to survive.  No, I love the big side.  Ain't nobody got time.  Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Sirius XM. 
[01:31:00]  This is the OPN3 Show.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Put your lighters up.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Put your lighters up.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Put your lighters up.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Put your lighters up.  D-Rock is taking a shit. 
[01:31:30]  D-Rock is taking a shit.  Drew Boogie, live in studio today.  All these can be heard on his new album, Radio Gold.  Go to iTunes.  Oh, no, these are just live stuff, some of these.  But the Radio Gold is all auto-tune stuff, like Bowling for Behave. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, I hear you.  If you like auto-tune, you'll love this album.  Very good.  Very good, indeed.  I like that.  Got Pig A outside the studio.  What's Pig A doing here?  I don't know.  We're just fucking around today.  It's obvious, which is fine by me.  It's Pig A.  It's going to take a nice long weekend after today, right?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Pig A is not smoking.  What did you say?  Huh?  Nothing.  I was just passing out the news.  Yeah, it's not good.  What?  What part?  The body. 
[01:32:30]  Maybe E-Rock should check.  Good call.  No, because...  I like the way you think.  Yeah?  We need to know what part.  It just makes them feel bad, though.  Yeah.  The look on Pig A's face.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Especially with pretty girls in the studio.  Oh, God.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  Pretty girl.  Me.  I wasn't fucking talking about you, cocksucker.  Oh, Chip.  I ain't fucking sucking your dick no more, ever.  What, Chip?  Why are you so mean?  I ain't sucking that thing. 
[01:33:00]  Big fucking giant thing.  Anymore.  Anymore.  I ain't slapping your cock against my face lovingly.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  Fuck you.  Well, let's get Big A in here.  Uh, B.  I mean, yeah.  Where's he gonna stand?  He's gonna stand by the door.  Stand in the place.  Bring him in, man.  He's gonna do the news for us.  We haven't done Big A's news in a long time.  Well over a year, right?  Yeah, man.  Has it been there?  Big A, what's up, brother?  Big A, there's Big A. 
[01:33:30]  Big E.  Saw you, uh, tweeting some pictures from F.H. Riley's the other day.  I, I saw.  Oh.  Yes, I was.  Um, I was at my dentist appointment.  Oh.  And afterwards, uh, I popped into F.H. Riley's.  Oh, oh.  How'd that go?  Oh, I have a few cavities to take care of it.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking Lawrence Olivier walked in with oil of cloves. 
[01:34:00]  Leaf discomfort.  How many, how, how many cavities did a dentist say you have?  Two, two hundred.  Two hundred.  That's not too bad.  Not too bad.  What's not too bad?  No.  You're a little too old for cavities.  Huh?  Um, a couple.  Couple?  Yeah.  And how's your diet going?  Not bad.  Maintaining.  Maintaining?  Yeah.  You're in the maintaining stage.  Yeah.  Right. 
[01:34:30]  That's good.  Maintain.  So what do you got to get?  Fillings?  Um, yeah.  He'll probably have me come in within a month.  Oh.  All right.  Love Big A.  I do too.  Of course.  Are you laughing?  I just, there's a whole dentist scenario in my head.  What are you laughing?  I don't know.  I just have this visual of the dentist quitting in the middle of the Big A exam.  Oh my goodness.  Big A exam.  Why?  I don't know.  Because he won the bar. 
[01:35:00]  Just making me giggle.  Sorry, Big A.  You know I love you.  You know I do.  How's my brother brother doing?  I haven't seen him in a while.  I don't know.  That's how I saw him was in March.  I was there at the Huntington.  Great.  St. Paddy's Day Parade.  I missed out on that this year.  I was away.  It's always a good time.  So we got Big A and we got some news, Ant.  Yes, the news.  You ready to do some news for everybody, Big A? 
[01:35:30]  So it's nice to see what's going on in the world, right?  Oh, absolutely.  Where's Iraq?  Can he come in and hold the paper for Big A?  I think he should hold the paper.  Yes.  Eric has to run the board.  No, he doesn't.  He has to run the board.  We're fine.  I got this.  Eric, you got her on the board today?  Yeah, he can come in and do it.  Hold the paper.  It's on autopilot.  Because there's a microphone and he's got the paper.  It's just going to be a mess.  Let Iraq at least hold the fucking paper.  Microphone.  That's a microphone.  Yeah, because he doesn't have a mic stand.  Yeah.  What was the bit we did with Iraq in Big A? 
[01:36:00]  Uncomfortably close news or something?  Oh, right.  I remember that one.  All right.  Iraq liked that.  You liked that one, right, Iraq?  That was a good bit for you.  Huh?  I didn't hear it.  When you had to do uncomfortably close news with...  You got to hold the paper for me.  Don't shake it.  Yeah.  Should we do that today?  Get Iraq involved?  Why not?  Iraq could do the second story.  No, no, no.  No, Eric can't do any of these stories written.  These are written specifically for one person.  Whoa!  Excuse me! 
[01:36:30]  Here, we'll just give Eric some stories.  No, it's okay.  No, it's fine.  Here, you can read the Snooki story.  Hold the fucking story for him.  Yeah, he loves Snooki.  Wait, no.  He should hold the mic.  What?  Oh, right.  Okay.  Let Eric hold the mic.  We got to give him a mic stand.  What?  I mean, I can get him a mic stand if you want.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  I'm watching that video.  Tape down.  Big A was a lot bigger there.  Yeah, Big A lost a lot of weight.  He looks good.  I'm happy to be there.  Yeah, he was a lot bigger there.  Hmm.  Hmm. 
[01:37:00]  Eric's not much.  Yeah, Eric's not much.  Yeah, Eric's a little bigger.  Oh, man.  Yeah, Eric's just a little bigger.  Look at Eric.  A little bigger, right?  He's a little bigger.  He walks a little bigger now.  A little bigger.  Look at this video.  I'm going to have to retweak that one.  I really do.  Is there anything wrong with getting a little bigger?  We all do.  All right, are you ready for the news?  Oh, do you want them to do the news together into the mic?  That's right.  Say, look at me, Ray.  Well, yeah, I mean, that's why I can give Eric some questions.  I get the mic stand.  I like it.  Eric, can you?  Should I do?  Oh, yeah, that's fair. 
[01:37:30]  It's got uncomfortably close.  I like the dueling fucking chins.  Big A fucking did a lot, though.  I'm so happy for him.  Big A, how much are you down, weight-wise?  Oh, about 100.  You're down 100, huh?  Really?  I'm not sure, because we just took one script.  Well, no, no, no.  I'm going to give Eric separate stories.  Oh, okay.  Because Big A has these stories, and I'll give Eric something from here.  Yeah, there you go.  That's easy.  Just grab something from the fucking pile. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  That's easy.  So Big A will start.  All right, Big A, you ready to do the news?  Eric, you've got to be as close as you were that day.  Yeah.  On this video we're watching.  Because it's uncomfortably close.  Look at that film here.  Just close to back.  What are we doing?  I don't have my camera today.  Sam, we've got some type of video recording device.  Right up there.  Pick out some stories for the sex books.  This is good.  We're going to hear a little bit about Facebook.  Yeah, we are. 
[01:38:30]  Facebook stock from Big A.  Well, look, you guys don't get to all the news sometimes.  I know.  So, you know.  We haven't done any news today.  That's why this works.  Well, yeah.  I was watching local news.  Local, like, New York news.  News 12?  It's, no, it was.  Yeah.  ABC?  ABC?  Which one?  Might as well be any one.  Either one.  Any one.  New York one?  It was like watching yesterday or even two days ago news.  There's nothing that they said that I didn't already know in pretty good detail. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  And they were shown video clips that I had seen two days before.  They're lost.  There's nothing.  There's no reason for local news anymore.  There's just no fucking reason for it.  Maybe for the upper demos?  Yeah.  The really old people?  I'm thinking for the old people.  But younger people, no way.  Dude, once they die off, that's it.  But there's no fucking body that would watch.  Why would you watch local news?  There wasn't one fucking story that I didn't already hear. 
[01:39:30]  And they're using the exact same formula from when we were growing up.  Like, they can't change?  Why can't they change?  Why do they do traffic on TV?  Why do you do weather?  You're right.  I'm going to sit there and watch the weather when I can just push a button, drag down the  fucking thing and see what the weather's going to be on my phone.  I want to watch weather on TV.  But the problem is, it's fun.  They take five minutes when it's one sentence.  It's really quick.  Give me the five-day.  I can figure it out on my own.  And we're good.  I was watching, and one of their stories was, and a man puts his child in a washing machine. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's quick.  Stay tuned for that one.  You won't believe what happens.  I'm like, yeah, I will, because I saw it fucking three days ago.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  Stupid.  Are we ready?  Yeah.  Eric's going to hold the papers out, right?  Well, why is Eric so far away?  Eric needs a story.  Come on, Iraq.  Where's Eric's story?  Yeah, where's his story?  Well, here, Eric.  You're going to have a big age.  Come on, guys.  Are those boring stories you're giving them?  I'm giving them something about Snooki and something about a murder. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, sorry.  You guys got to be, because the bit is uncomfortably close, so you'll look silly if you're right  next to each other.  Like when rock people, when the singer and the guitarist have to share a mic to fucking  sing harmonies.  Like Steven Tyler and Joe Perry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what you gots to do.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Hold each other's copy.  You hold that one and show it to Big A, and Big A holds yours. 
[01:41:00]  I want to know what's wrong with E-Rock.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Oh, E-Rock.  What's the deal, E-Rock?  E-Rock's just miserable.  He's just a miserable person.  He really is.  All right.  Big A, can you face E-Rock a little more with your script?  I hope these were written without a lot of S-T words, because that voice trips them  up.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, this isn't good.  No, you can face each other.  Yeah, face each other.  Yeah, like that.  Yeah, perfect.  Perfect.  You're doing the news to E-Rock.  Now get right on the mic.  Get right on the mic.  Balthier's got to get right on the fucking mic. 
[01:41:30]  All right.  You got to move to the mic, because you're soft-spoken.  No, he's good.  He's okay.  No, he's soft-spoken.  Make sure he's soft-spoken, Jimmy.  I think he's got to get a little closer.  All right.  Get it, Big A.  Just speak up.  Let her rip.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Good night.  Oh, boy.  No.  Not that one.  Good one.  Ticker.  This is Big A, and his...  Yeah, his mic.  He's got to get closer.  I honestly...  Yeah, you got to get closer. 
[01:42:00]  You really...  There you go.  Turn this way.  Other way.  Okay.  There you go.  Yeah, right there.  Right into the mic.  You've done this, Big A.  Right into the mic, because we can barely hear you.  Yeah.  You are actually below.  All right.  Start over.  I'm sorry.  We have to start over.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  What's wrong, Iraq?  It's just the news.  I'm just reading the stories.  Well.  Mm-hmm.  Good morning, United States of America.  This is Big A, and here's some news. 
[01:42:30]  To start your day.  Oh.  A news report claims that Facebook is considering a move to New York's talk exchange after a series 
[01:43:00]  of stupid technical glitches.  Of stupid technical glitches.  Whoa.  Oh, please.  The next day of trading on FTEK, the stock has... 
[01:43:30]  The stock has...  ...stumbled...  ...starting at its initial public offering of $38... 
[01:44:00]  ...and stopped at $32 yesterday afternoon.  It is... 
[01:44:30]  ...it is...  ...it is still...  ...to...  ...state...  ...that it's...  ...a stock will...  ...will stack up...

Yeah, I'm fine.  What's wrong, buddy?  Yeah.  Oh, my head hurts.  What's wrong, buddy?  Buddy.  What's wrong, buddy?  What's wrong, buddy?  Nicole Snooki...  Oh, my God.  Nicole Snooki Paluzzi... 
[01:45:30]  ...has revealed...  ...that she's having a boy...  ...a disappointment to the Jersey Shore star...  ...as she dreamed of dressing up her baby in pink leopard...  ...leopard...  I thought it was going to be a girl, Snooki tells in Touch Magazine.  I was hoping...  ...it would be because all girls want girls.  You're supposed to face me.  Well, that's not right.  Um, it's still my baby, no matter what. 
[01:46:00]  I am excited either way.  While many had hoped the reality TV star...  ...would pick a non-traditional name, perhaps Pickle...  ...Snooki tells the magazine that she...  ...and her fiancé, Gianni...  ...have narrowed it down to two names.  The pair will be choosing between the classic Italian monikers...  ...Lorenzo or Gianni Jr.  Snooki...  ...who is due in the fall... 
[01:46:30]  ...revealed yesterday that she will be a part of Jersey Shore Season 6.  She will not be living in Seaside Heights Beach House...  ...with her co-stars.  Instead, she will reside nearby.  With all the bacteria...  ...and everyone having sex in the smush room...  ...it's just not where a pregnant person or a baby should be...  ...Snooki told E-news.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.

[01:50:30]  And his sticking to his steamy...  It's moving away again.  Who are we?  John Travolta, as you may know, was this R of A alive? 
[01:51:00]  Oh, that was John Travolta's story. 
[01:51:30]  A 13-year-old girl and two other students at a California middle school were arrested for allegedly conspiring to kill the girl's mother over an imposed curfew.  My goodness.  Police responded to an incident Tuesday morning at home in Hesperia, California.  A woman reportedly told authorities that she had been attacked by her 13-year-old daughter who fled the scene. 
[01:52:00]  You got to get closer.  Investigators later said that the teenage girl and two other juveniles plotted to kill the woman over house rules, including a curfew, KTLA reported.  The teen, as well as a 14-year-old girl, had a 14-year-old boy, were arrested in the alleged plan.

I wandered around Central Park with my son. 
[02:07:00]  I did a little dinner with my wife.  My sister came in, babysat, and I had some treats.  Where'd you go to dinner?  Central Park is nice.  I went to Oceans near the museum.  That's a seafood place.  That's good.  Fucking good.  Sat outside.  Nice.  Do you know what I don't like about Oceans is there's too many photos inside?  The whole wall is like, photo, photo, photo, photo, photo, photo, picture,  picture, picture, photo, picture, picture.  We got it.  Photo.  But it's actually very good.  Were they famous people?  No.  Did you ever go to that bar, Mug Shots, on the Upper East Side?  They have all the rest photos of every famous guide ever. 
[02:07:30]  Who's not at that?  It's great.  We're going to open a place called Mug Shot.  It's great.  That's a great concept.  Yeah, it's awesome.  They got a picture of Al Pacino when he was like fucking 17 years old.  Got arrested for, it says why they were arrested too, carrying a handgun.  Really?  Yeah, you would like that.  Wow, yeah.  Al Pacino in 17?  Yeah.  With a handgun.  Yeah.  It's clearly him.  It's awesome.  That's kind of cool.  Was it allowed to scare away any pain in the ass innocent bystanders?  Yeah.  Do they have silly shots there you could buy?  Oh, that's it.  Look, he looks like a little thug.  Oh, you mean drink names?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:08:00]  They might go silly with the Mug Shots as actual shots you could buy at the bar.  Yeah, Jesus.  That's Imus?  Fucking cadaver.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he needs to put the cowboy hat back on.  Don't invest in a monthly planner.  He looks like, yeah, fucking Pacino looks like a little guinea hood.  Oh, you got the picture?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  Sam Turner.  I thought I told you guineas to stay away.  He's an old guy.  What year is he that?  Is he in the 60s?  Oh, God. 
[02:08:30]  I like when he shoots McCluskey in the throat.  He looks like he's still trying to enjoy the veal.  He's trying to chew it.  Yeah, it's too good.  I got to take one swallow.  Always take 20 chews before you swallow.  You don't want to choke.  He's like.  Yeah.  That's great.  And how come, what's his name?  Fish.  What was his name?  Invergoda.  Yeah.  Tessio.  When he immediately chimes in about the toilet, like he took a shit in every toilet in the 
[02:09:00]  five boroughs.  It's perfect.  It's got a pool chain.  Family atmosphere.  Right.  He knows all the toilets.  And a busy colon.  I've taken a shit in every toilet in the city.  It's perfect for our deeds.  You should have that checked in.  We could tape it behind.  Yeah.  You don't like the way he just fired that out immediately?  Yeah.  Spastic colon.  The whole toilet just knows all the toilets.  Yeah.  His skid marked fucking undies.  Yeah.  I bet he's hit his pants or something. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, Chip.  Oh, Chip.  Oh, shit.  You should have a conversation.  Put the brakes on everything.  Yeah, you do.  No, see.  No, see.  You guys are missing Brooke Hogan on TV.  She's a wrestler now.  What happened?  Is she climbing the Empire Staple?  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Oh, wait a minute.  That was Dee Snider in his Twisted Sister garb.  I guess we didn't get Brooke Hogan today, huh?  She's coming up.  She's coming up later this afternoon.  Everybody comes up later just to avoid us.  True.  Yeah.  True.  What else is going on with you, Otto? 
[02:10:00]  How'd your show do?  Yeah.  It's done, right?  You had the season finale.  Oh, the pig roast?  That's still on demand on the pig roast.  Did it do well for you?  Everybody loved it.  I want to do a show in Vegas.  That's what I really want to do is tape it as a live show in Vegas, but that hasn't gone  through yet, like most of my dreams.  I'm doing yet another podcast called Puppies in Sunshine.  You can see that also.  I mean, hear that.  That's an adorable name. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I'm doing...  How's the podcasting gone?  That's a cinch.  You know, we started in an hour.  It flies by.  It's a lot of fun.  Who do you do it with?  Joe Conti and Kenny Michaels, my two friends.  And George?  No.  No George?  We do a segment where the listeners ask George a question.  Oh, okay.  I hate that fucking segment.  Really?  Why?  You don't like doing George unless you're in front of people, right?  Yeah, it's a nightclub thing.  I don't do it when somebody...  Like every radio show I've ever done, they always try and goat me into bad-mouthing Jeff 
[02:11:00]  Dunham.  I have nothing against the guy.  I mean, to me, he's more of like a Jim Henson than what I do.  I have the one character that's a domineering character.  He's got a thousand little creatures.  And they always try and like get me to bash the guy.  I have nothing, you know...  Ah, that fucking rich guy.  Yeah.  I mean...  That successful guy.  He's an interesting guy.  We've had him on.  He's a wonderful entertainer.  He's cool, Tom.  I have a great Dunham story.  I was playing in Vegas years ago at the Riviera and was working for Steve Sharippa, Bobby Bacaloff 
[02:11:30]  and the Sopranos.  So I play in the comedy room, which is like a 300-seat room.  And Dunham...  He booked Dunham the same week as me in the big room where Dean Martin used to play.  And all I see is Dunham's picture all over the fucking casino in the elevators.  And normally when I arrived at the hotel, I'd see my picture within five minutes of walking  in the hotel.  So I called up Shariffa and he's a scary guy to talk to.  You know, every conversation he says, I'll bury you in the desert if you don't do the full  time. 
[02:12:00]  You know, that's how he talks to you.  But he's a big, intimidating guy.  I can see why they hired him for that role.  And so I called him up, pretty much screaming at him.  I go, why is Dunham here the same week as me?  Why is there two ventriloquists?  Why is his picture everywhere?  He goes, are you giving me shit?  And he goes, you're funny and he's not.  If he goes, if you give me any more shit, I'll kick everybody out of this fucking hotel  and put puppets in every room.  And then we immediately, both of us just cracked up at the absurdity of that statement.  I'll put puppets in every room. 
[02:12:30]  And then he just started laughing at just the fucking, it was so absurd.  Fucking crazy.  I couldn't leave.  I screamed at him.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because that's a weird booking to have both of you guys.  I didn't get it.  I didn't get it.  Did you have people show up?  Kind of dumb.  Yeah.  I had a normal, the Penn Jillette always brings 50 people to see me.  Dunham came and he was groveling and kissing my ass.  Oh, wow.  It was great.  You know, he was a really nice guy.  But then my friend Bill Sacred was like, I'm talking to him and he walks away.  I guess I did my usual short answer and, you know, bad eye contact. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  You're a fucking awful stiff bent handshake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  My friend Bill is like, talk to him, like shoving me.  I go, what do I talk to him about?  Yeah.  He goes, I do the same thing.  I have nothing in common with him.  You know, he's, you know, he's from the Midwest.  He has kids.  I don't.  What am I going to say?  Yeah.  Jerry Mahoney.  Yeah.  He was good.  Take care.  It's only so much fucking puppet conversation.  Yeah.  But it really is one of the few joys I can still hold on to is watching Otto try to be 
[02:13:30]  friendly to people when they come up and they're like, hey, I really like you.  And he just doesn't know how to cut off.  He's like, all right.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, you got the goon to go move it along.  You know, I have to deal with these people, you know, fucking.  You don't have your own goon, huh?  Oh, it's, it's got to get the goon.  I told you one of my favorite things.  We did a gig in Delaware.  Yeah.  It was a giant fucking, this is many years ago, a giant room, like a big bar. 
[02:14:00]  And afterwards, I was out there and Otto killed and I had a great set.  And there was a girl that walked up to me and she didn't know Otto was the ventriloquist  because he didn't have George with him in the parking lot.  And she just, everyone focuses on George.  So she goes, you were really funny.  And she goes, I liked you more than the last guy.  And she was, he was really funny, but he was more of a guy's comic.  Like she did enjoy you, but you know, you're very harsh for a young fucking girl.  Yeah.  And her head was not shaped good. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, shit.  She had a really bad hairline.  Oh, no.  And she said, when she said like he was a good comic, but more of a guy's comic, Otto  said, yeah, well, you're really pretty, except for your forehead.  It's too big.  And she was so hurt.  She took her palm and she palmed Otto with a forehead.  Holy shit.  Wow.  She must've been upset.  Dude, it was so uncomfortable and fucking great.  Good.  Fuck her.  She palmed Otto with a forehead. 
[02:15:00]  Did you like that?  That he said the worst thing to say?  Dude, I remember that exchange in the parking lot like it happened four minutes ago.  That's hilarious.  What did you laugh at more?  Me getting hit or her?  The whole thing of it was the fact that you just, you went to, you went to, her making  an offhanded remark, you went right for the Achilles.  Yeah.  You sliced her Achilles.  And because you said forehead, she just palmed your forehead.  She didn't know how to handle it.  She didn't know how to react to it.  It was everything that she's ever been afraid a guy would say to her. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  No guy has ever said that.  Like, they've all talked to her and looked up at her fucking bad hairline.  But she sees the eyes go up, but she's never actually had a guy say it to her.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Except for your forehead.  It's too big.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Yeah.  In hindsight, she did try and spare my feelings by saying I'm a guy coming and all that.  She didn't know it was you at first for a second.  But she really was, she was saying that sincerely.  Yeah.  She just thought you were harsh, but funny.  God, I'm a vindictive, vicious asshole.  Fuck her hydrocephalous head.  She'll learn next time to fucking think before she speaks. 
[02:16:00]  You taught her a lesson.  Think with that giant brain.  Yeah.  That's still one of my favorite memories.  I've talked about it before is me and him.  There was no time we picked up girls, filled that hollow head with Roosevelt dimes, bash  her head on a sink.  What about picking up girls together?  I got to hear this one.  I can't imagine you guys picking up girls together, Jimmy.  We did, yeah.  It was very rarely ever happening. 
[02:16:30]  But we did.  And I might have heard this story.  Yeah, yeah.  We've told this story.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You didn't get any of that.  Oh, the grandfather who tossed himself out the window?  Yeah.  I had more fun making you laugh than trying to fuck either of those dumb girls.  We met these two girls and we went back to one of the girls' houses.  I forget how it came up, but the one girl was telling us how her grandfather  had committed suicide by jumping out a window. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, jeez.  And when we got back to the house, it was really dark in the kitchen and we were being  really quiet and we're headed to the pool area to go for a dip and there's a picture  of the old man on the refrigerator and Otto so callously said, hey, is this the one  that tossed himself out the window?  So wrong.  And I know, no cooth.  Oh, my God.  I fucking, you know that naughty laughing when you can't, it was so wrong. 
[02:17:30]  Fuck, that's funny.  Me, her friend, and Otto all laughed.  I remember there was a thing of cat shit in the fucking kitchen.  Yeah, I remember that pool that, yeah, now that you remind me, it's all coming back.  I got to really work on that, right?  Yeah.  Nah, fuck it.  Nah.  That's hilarious.  The point of the picture, that's the one who tossed himself out the window.  Wow, is that funny, man.  That's fucking brutal.  That was a funny fucking man.  I miss those days.  I used to have to pick Otto up because he didn't drive.  Yeah.  And I would be in central Jersey, we'd be going to Pennsylvania, and I'd have to go north 
[02:18:00]  to fucking Jewel Avenue in Queens.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I remember you fucking, remember you stepped in dog shit and got in my new car, fucking  asshole?  Yes.  And Florentine's like, hey, Otto, you dragged the whole log into the car.  Me, Jim, and me, Jim, and fucking Otto are doing a gig, and he fucking, with my brand  new son.  I'm a ripe dog shit.  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah, there was still a warm nougat-y center in that.  It was horrible.  It was a type of shit that immediately sinks into the treads of your sneakers and ruins. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, wow.  It's unfixable, yeah.  That was your Saturn, when you got the Saturn?  Brand new, like 95, 96.  That was that long?  Wait a minute.  Yeah, the Saturn's that long ago.  Oh, wait, wait.  No, I got a 95 Mustang.  It might have been 99, the Saturn.  Yeah, because I remember when you got the Saturn.  So maybe this was my Mustang.  I don't remember.  Oh, man.  Or it might have been the Saturn in 99.  Damn.  Yeah, you just get that shit that just...  Oh, do you remember when I got the Saturn?  Yeah.  Yeah, we remember when you got the Saturn. 
[02:19:00]  I've gotten more than one Saturn, though.  I drove a couple of Saturns.  Saturns.  Yeah.  Saturns.  I used to love the Saturn.  Yeah.  There were many stories of you perusing the neighborhood with the window half down.  Yeah.  Hookers.  Talking to ladies.  Oh, boy.  Gentlemen, whatever they were.  There's a lot of androgynous blowjobs.  How much do you think you spent on prostitutes in your adult life?  I won't even look at it.  I can't think about it.  Is it enough to buy a private jet, do you think?  It's a lot of money.  Yeah? 
[02:19:30]  It's a lot of money, man.  What's the most you ever paid for one single hula?  $1,000.  $1,000?  Yeah.  Was she like a Manhattan call girl, stunning?  Yeah, it was somebody who I'd wanted to fuck for a long time.  Well, how did you know what she looked like?  I had met her, and I knew she did, you know.  Did some movies?  No movies, no.  Did you say to her, I'll give you $1,000?  Oh, yeah.  You can be cleaned up.  You're dead.  You're dead. 
[02:20:00]  I'll give you $1,000 if I don't do good.  Fucking psychotic, Bob.  Can be cleaned up.  Can be cleaned up.  I'm telling you.  Would you pay more for somebody?  No, this was because she was a woman who'd posed in magazines and stuff.  Do we know her?  I don't know.  You might.  What does $1,000 get you?  An orgasm or the whole night?  Do you get to fuck her more than once?  Yeah, you could have done what you wanted.  I mean, it was not the whole night, a couple hours, but she was a good fuck. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah?  She was a good fuck.  Yeah.  Wait, you got to talk us through this.  So you kind of knew her from the magazines.  Yeah.  How do you get to the point where I'll give you $1,000?  Well, I found out she escorted.  I know a few big madams, and we had talked a little bit.  And I had talked to her for a long time.  Yeah.  And I had just never done it because she wanted too much money.  But I'm like, you know what?  You never do this.  So I paid her a grand.  And how long ago was this?  Wait, who never does this? 
[02:21:00]  She or you?  Me, me.  I never spend that kind of money.  Right, okay.  I spend, but not that much.  I can't afford that.  Yeah.  How long ago was it?  Two years ago.  Oh, okay.  So you couldn't afford it then.  Yeah, yeah.  Less than two years ago.  I was thinking like if it was a long time ago, that's a lot of money then.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  And...  Did you beat off so you could like fuck her longer when she got there first?  No, if I beat off my dick, it would have looked like a fucking twisted pigtail.  No.  Okay.  My dick is one and done.  I'm trying to fuck her with a slinky.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  I have to take the heel of my shoe and pound my cock on me. 
[02:21:30]  So, uh, she came over, we were talking and kissing, and she was fucking sexy, man.  Yeah?  Juicy thigh highs.  Oh.  And she was in, she was recently in a magazine?  No.  I think it's a few years ago.  Can we see her on the internet?  We won't say her name.  Um, I'll show you off air.  I'll show you off air.  You don't trust us?  No, no.  It's not that I trust you, no.  I'm on my good behavior.  No, no, no.  I actually do trust you.  And after the act, did you, did you feel shame or did you feel great? 
[02:22:00]  I felt great.  You did?  And I was like, hope she doesn't get pregnant.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Came her back.  In her.  Came in her.  Wow.  She let you do that, huh?  Held her ass and fucking, I think I said I love you and came.  Wow.  It was very inappropriate.  This is why I got into show business with stories about prostitutes and all that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  All the good stuff.  I don't want to hear about going to bed early, you know?  I checked my emails and went to bed early.  No, I didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a good one, man. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  That was a good one.  That was the big one.  A thousand bucks.  Yeah, and I wouldn't do that again.  Unless it was, again, something.  There are certain people.  Have you spent a hundred thousand?  Oh, yeah.  Not recently, but I mean, over the course of my life, I think so.  You know what?  Wow.  Yeah?  That's a number that comes to mind.  I don't know about that.  That's a lot of money.  I don't know.  That's not a lot for a hobby or something that gives you pleasure.  I mean, just equate it to anything that gives you pleasure, like eating out, go to a restaurant  or something like that, you know?  Well, what's the average?  Big deal.  It's from a steak, though. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  That's true.  Good point, Dan.  Jimmy, what's the average, though?  Back when I was doing it, it was 300.  I mean, 250.  It was nothing.  Nothing.  Like, I didn't have some fucking two grand tonight hooker.  It was all around the same.  Might be a hundred thousand.  Fargad night.  I'll tell you, but then it switched to massages because of the disease risk and all that stuff,  and the majority of the acting out in the last five years was massages.  That was it.  Like, trying to get a girl to give you a handjob if you could.  Occasionally, you get your dick sucked, but it was not like... 
[02:23:30]  You're like Travolta with the massage people.  Oh, believe me.  That's why I know he did it.  Hey, let me...  That's why I believe he did it, I should say.  Yeah.  That's why I believe he did it.  Black guys.  What did he offer that big guy?  They'd say he offered...  The guy is claiming he offered him like $1,200.  $12,000.  Oh, $12,000.  No, that was the guy on the ship that said that.  Yeah, that was the ship guy.  Yeah.  $12,000.  The black guy.  I don't know what he's saying.  He's saying that Travolta's lawyers offered him $120,000.  To just, yeah, leave him alone.  But they're saying no, he didn't.  Messina told me that when Tim Allen was doing the press junket for that motorcycle movie 
[02:24:00]  he did with Travolta, he said he clearly...  He had his...  It was Travolta's private jet, and he was flying from city to city in Europe, and he said  he clearly had a male escort with him, and it was like, he wasn't trying to hide it.  He told me this years ago.  Really?  That's a second-hand...  Messina was there on a plane.  He told me that's a second-hand Travolta confirmation.  It's a second-hand story.  We can't confirm it.  You have to, for legal reasons, say we've heard that, but you can't say it's true.  I could say it's true.  No. 
[02:24:30]  The official, we don't know.  We really don't.  Wow.  That's...  Sounds like it could be, but we have no idea.  Yeah, who knows?  That's just co-interesting.  I mean, are they still going to let him play John Gotti after this came out?  Nah.  The Gottis are saying yes, but...  Nah, they'll make that go away.  There's some people that said...  Jesus fucking Christ.  Ring-a-ding.  Ring-a-ding.  I forgot to shut it off.  How loud is that fucking thing?  Terrible!  That's old school.  Terrible!  I do like the old school.  Yeah, that's an old phone or something.  Yeah.  Who's calling you?  Heaven or something?  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  We got Vic Henley here, too, by the way.  We should get him in, because we're not going late today.  Fuck that.  Sam, get out of the way.  Let Vic sit where you are.  You know Vic, don't you?  Yeah.  You know Vic?  I believe so.  Yeah.  On site, I will.  Vic's a good guy.  Yeah, you know him when you see him, right?  Bring him in.  I'll check.  Yeah, I think you know him.  That's how I go.  That's how I roll.  Just get along.  Just bring him in, Sam.  Oh, I'm going to be at Foxwoods Sunday with Valby.  Oh, man.  That's a good show.  Yeah, our Memorial Day bash.  How's the Valby thing going with you guys?  It's open for many people, but I agree to this, because it's just I crush it for a half 
[02:25:30]  hour, and then I get to watch him and have a beer.  When are you doing that?  I would love to see that show, man.  No shit.  Sunday at Foxwoods.  Sunday at Foxwoods.  That would be a fucking fun show to watch.  Yeah.  Like, first of all.  I kill!  I kill!  Following Otto would be a nightmare, but Valby can follow you, because he's Valby and it's  music and he's singing, and even if they're yelling, it's like, la la la!  You don't know what they're doing.  That's great when you're doing that.  How's his drinking?  How's Valby's drinking?  Valby drinks rock glasses filled with tequila, as many as they'll send up, but he won't drink 
[02:26:00]  after he's settled before, only during in performance.  It's the weird thing.  Wow, really?  That's how he convinces himself he doesn't have a problem.  Yeah, but he gets slushed, man.  He's like 73 or something.  Holy shit.  Is he really that old now?  Is he in his late 60s?  Yeah, I would say late 60s.  Hi, Vic. Welcome to the show.  This is the total opposite of my policy, by the way.  Only on stage till he's sober.  The other 24 hours are there. 
[02:26:30]  Drinking, drugging, hookers, crack, whatever you need.  Do you know Otto?  No, I do not.  I love you for a thousand years.  Pleasure, man.  Everybody in the city does.  I've seen you on TV.  I've seen you on many of the stages that I wished I was on.  Oh, God.  No, it's fabulous to see.  Thank you.  It's absolutely, completely, yeah.  I've told stories where I said I knew you and I was lying.  That's funny.  That's crazy.  I'll be 67, if anyone cares.  67, man.  67.  He's just pounding tequila on stage like that. 
[02:27:00]  Angel Salazar, 84.  Burning a hooker's pussy with a crackpot.  84 years old.  He just got busted DWR.  I saw that about a month or two ago.  That's because he was burning her pussy with a crackpot.  He was looking at the road.  Shake it off.  Yeah, I know.  Nice hand for Otto.  Ha-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  Two men  Marching in  Half the gangbang

[02:28:00]  Gladiator before he took her to the gang  Some of those were so fucking funny though  When he would get a name  When he would just call out names  Brilliant ones  That son of a bitch made me laugh  I forgot I enjoyed it this much  We gotta give a shout out to Ron  Ron writes a lot of that shit  Ron's a great guy  He's a behind the scenes guy 
[02:28:30]  With that big fucking cigar  Drives John Valby everywhere  He came over to my house  Because we had a gig in Jersey  And he came in with a big bag  Of Kentucky fried chicken  And we were watching Godfather 2  On TV just killing time  And then he goes  Alright I'm gonna go to the truck  And write some material now  And Ron goes  He hasn't written anything  In 20 fucking years  He's just an anti-social pariah  And he goes and sits in the truck  And eats his fucking shitty food  And he refuses to fly to gigs 
[02:29:00]  Yeah  He won't fly?  He's a nut  Oh I told the story really fast  He told HBO  Oh no absolutely not  I won't do his special  Really?  Wow  He went to our virus show  It's like  Oh god  He would have killed it  But we were at Governor's  And there was a horrendous snowstorm  Coming in  And he was driving  All the way to Buffalo  Because he's a massive Bills fan  And he had to get back  For the fucking Sunday football games  Like no one's driving tonight  And you're gonna drive  All the way to Buffalo  In this weather?  He made it  He made it  Of course he did  And Ron gets behind that wheel 
[02:29:30]  And that shitty van of theirs  Took off  And I hoped for the best that night  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Lepersy  Jesus  I ride  Lepersy  Oh my skin is falling off of me  Do you remember that one?

Lick my love bump  He's sitting there  He did that to calm everyone down  Like I'll see  I know how to play piano  Everyone in the store  Was standing around  And they started crowding around

[02:39:00]  The Canuck girls came round, from Chippewa on down.  There was a big one they call Itchy Woomy.  Now I didn't gripe that her twat looked like trite,  but the smell of her feet really threw me.  The crew came on deck with their peckers erect,  going down on a hefty Hispanic.  I was second in line of 109. 
[02:39:30]  The best men went down on the Titanic.  Two laddies came in, she was doing her nails,  so she jerked them both off with her right foot.  Her boyfriend had the hot, so he pumped 29 shots  in the ass of that bag, Gordon Whitefoot.  I cruised down the street, saw some faggots in a heat. 
[02:40:00]  Edmund was hung double barrel.  Jerry had two little holes in his butt.  I just love the way Edmund Fitzgerald.  I just love the way Edmund Fitzgerald.  I just love the way Edmund Fitzgerald.  I just love the way Edmund Fitzgerald.  The Opinatrix Show.  I love the way Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[02:40:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Drew Boogie doing a great job for us today.  In studio, Otto and George. 
[02:41:00]  Or Otto, sorry.  Otto from Otto and George.  And Vic Henley.  Liking Vic on the show as well.  Oh, man.  Double psychosis you got here today, boy.  Oh, man.  Triple, where's Norton?  Fine, Norton, for the trifecta of insanity.  Bastard.  Jimmy, go to the can.  Yeah, Jimmy's in the can.  And on the phone, Bill Burr wants to make a quick bet with me, Bill.  Yeah, what's going on?  What's up?  You got Otto in studio, Vic Henley.  Big A's here.  What's up, brother?  What's happening? 
[02:41:30]  What's the bet?  The Bruins got knocked out of the playoffs,  so I finally just gave in to watch the filthiest league in all of sports, the NBA.  You don't like large black men flying through the air with a little orange sphere?  I don't mind that at all.  I just think the officiating is worse than it is in wrestling.  Oh, you're absolutely right, Bill.  You see the flagrant fouls the other night with the heat and the pacers?  That was ridiculous.  That was ridiculous.  That guy had it coming. 
[02:42:00]  He looked like that white dude.  He looked like the guy who beat up Robbie Benson in one-on-one.  Up your ass with a red-hot poker.  That's the line from that movie.  But you little hypocrite never once did you have to have your character molded.  That kid totally had it coming.  He gave Wade stitches.  Yeah, he did.  You've got to know that that's coming.  He took it like a champ.  He popped right back up.  And then those refs the other night, right?  Kobe gets two quick fouls on him. 
[02:42:30]  All right?  And then like ten minutes later, just in the second quarter, somebody in Oklahoma City rebounds the ball.  And Kobe comes down and just hacks the guy right across both forearms.  It was so quick, the guy blew his whistle, calls the foul.  And then it was almost like they're like, oh, my God, it's Kobe.  They had like a meeting for about two minutes.  And then they put the foul on some bum who was standing next to him.  I know.  The officiating, they're just letting him play real dirty in the playoffs this year.  I'm just fascinated that Bill Burr went with the G.W. Spradlin, a G.D. Spradlin reference. 
[02:43:00]  That's the actor's name to play the coach.  Oh, yeah.  A movie I haven't thought of in years.  I'm obsessed with the Heat losing this goddamn thing, but the Pacers are kind of falling off now.  Well, you know, I like Oklahoma City and San Antonio.  That's where I'm, you know, I have no problem with that.  OKC would be nice.  Yeah, I totally would like that, too.  How great would that be if they win the whole thing?  As long as the Heat don't win.  I'm obsessed with that.  Hey, we got a game seven, Bill.  We got the Celtic Sixers. 
[02:43:30]  All right, we got to put something on it.  Because I know through your lovely wife, you're now sort of a Philly fan, right?  I'm sort of a Philly fan, yeah.  Is that Spradlin guy the guy from the Godfather, too?  Yes, and he's the coach of North Dallas 40.  Elliot, he's the one always lecturing Nick Knobbs in North Dallas 40.  Apocalypse Now.  Oh, yeah, he's fabulous.  You might want to pass both ways.  Oh, just save time.  That's great.  Save time.  That's what Burgess wrote out.  Save time.  Try these shrimp, and you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way. 
[02:44:00]  OK, I tell him goodbye.  You might want to pass both ways to save time.  Such a military-minded way of thinking.  He had a weird way of talking.  That awful shrimp.  He was great.  And who was that creepy guy with the cigarette in that scene that doesn't say anything?  Extreme prejudice.  Yeah, when he gives him the cigarette, that evil handoff.  How do you remember this shit?  You know, Steve McQueen turned down that part, the Martin Sheen part.  Yeah, right.  Really?  Yeah.  I guess he had just made Papillon. 
[02:44:30]  He didn't want to be in the jungle and, you know, up to his teeth.  Yeah, he'd fed up right.  Absolutely.  Probably better, too.  He would have been smart.  She's better than McQueen would have been.  With his mesothelioma.  Right.  From his asbestos racing suits.  Steve McQueen would have made it cool.  Martin Sheen made it.  I'm losing my shit just like Marlon Brando is.  Yeah.  You know, Steve McQueen would have made it cool.  He'd have been fucking jumping the boat over there.  Yeah, he was a masterful man.  He was fabulous.  So you wanted to do Sixers, Celtics?  I'm not, I don't really care about the Sixers that much.  Hey, did I just hear Jim Norton and all of that? 
[02:45:00]  Hi, Bill.  I was outside the studio before the phone call.  I just kind of came in and you were in mid-conversation.  Oh, all right.  What's going on, man?  Hi, buddy.  Dude, I just watched that hilarious video of you getting choked by Randy Cotur.  That one's great.  Do you know what's funny?  I watched that recently.  I forgot Patrice was there.  Yes.  And he goes, do you ever choke a clam?  Use that technique.  Choke a clam.  That's wonderful.  Oh, that's too damn good.  Oh, that's really good.  I'm closing with that this weekend.  Don't start jerking off. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  Don't start jerking off.  Yeah, that was fucking hilarious, man.  I forgot Patrice was here that day.  Oh, that's beautiful.  Good old Patrice.  Yeah, the sound you make is fantastic.  All the noises you make in this video.  Yeah, I clicked the link.  I watched that for like 10 minutes left yesterday, just laughing my ass off.  That one at the end of the video, whoever put that on the loop, killing me.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:46:00]  Did it hurt, Jim?  It's been great.  Yeah, it's scary.  Yeah.  But you made him do it again.  Yeah, that's what I do.  We made the other guy hit him twice.  The last time I was there, he made the guy hit him twice.  The guy hit him, and he goes, give me 10%.  And the guy hit him, he goes, that wasn't enough.  And the guy hit him harder.  And then three days later at the cellar, Norton goes, my arm still fucking hurts.  I can't believe I told him to hit him again.  He was an ultimate fighter or something.  Yeah, those guys.  Really?  You had to punch you?  Yeah.  He always does two takes.  He always does two takes.  Yeah.  He punches him, chokes him out.  How much am I supposed to come? 
[02:46:30]  Jimmy's earning his money here.  He's done it a dozen times easily.  It's something more than just feeling what it feels like.  It's something he agrees.  He wants to be hurt.  He enjoys something about it.  He wants to be hurt a little.  It's something there.  Sexual?  No, no, I'm not saying sexual at all.  No, no, no.  The Jon Jones kick to the upper thigh, that, to me, was the worst one you took.  It's the worst one, because I almost fainted.  It hurts so badly.  Look at this laughing.  Dude, I thought I was going to throw up.  I bet he still allowed him to choke him out the same day.  Yeah.  He's the same player.  I had to go to the bathroom, because I thought I was going to vomit, because it shocked my 
[02:47:00]  system when he put his shin into my thigh.  It hurt so badly.  I wasn't ready for that.  I was in a knee brace after that, because I was walking so gingerly that I twisted my  fucking knee getting into bed.  Wow.  Oh, man.  That really fucked me up good.  Getting into bed?  I know.  Oh, wow.  I was actually there that day.  It hurt so bad.  I remember Jim had, like, the pain was like a delay.  Yeah.  He got hit, and it was like literally three seconds, and then it just washed over his face. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, that's right.  But that is what it did.  It washed over me.  It, like, took a second to hit.  Yeah.  And then it was like my whole body went into a shock from that type of, I'm glad I didn't  get that.  I hope you have to get fake knees like Joe Namath in the video on the community with fucking  football knees.  Those fucking seven-year-old men's knees.  Bobby Kelly's on his third set.  Bobby Kelly's on his third set.  Yeah.  The ones they have commercials for during the day.  If you had a knee implant that just cracked, popped out of your fucking leg. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  My favorite one, though, is the, uh, if you've had a vaginal mesh or a sling put in and have  trouble urinating a painful fucking sleeve.  If you've had a clitoral sleeve.  Apparently, you bitches, when enough time, you've been on Earth enough time where gravity,  gravity will pull your vagina right out.  It just pulls it out.  You gotta put some kind of fucking sling.  Like what they're using submarines to hold the salami and produce. 
[02:48:30]  It's like underneath the pelican's throat.  It's what's underneath the pelican's throat.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a pelican catch.  Oh, man.  And they gotta tell you about it every fucking day.  Yeah, we don't wanna hear about it.  Hearing about these vaginal meds.  And then they have stock photographs of these women in pain.  They're just like, all right, we need stock photos of elderly women with their hand over  their mouth looking like, oh, my pussy's falling out.  She's hurting.  Yeah.  It is painful.  It must be. 
[02:49:00]  When you fucking wake up and your pussy's falling out.  Apparently, they take this netting and they attach it inside you somehow and it props up your guts  so it don't fall out of your pussy.  They actually sell it.  It's tuna free.  That's right.  No dolphins were killed during the installation.  Oh, yeah.  Dolphin free.  I suck.  That's a fucking...  You set it up.  I took it.  I said it totally wrong.  I know.  I took it.  It's fine.  I'll take the incident.  It's a ricochet.  It's a ricochet goal in hockey. 
[02:49:30]  They put a fucking gill net up.  It's horrible.  Horrible.  It's gotta be horrible being a woman.  That vagina is just fucking with you.  From the second you get your period until your cunt falls out, you're just...  Excuse me, madam.  Is that a souffle or did your pussy fall out?  Old souffle box.  You saved it right there.  You just saved it with a souffle box.  I'm surprised I didn't say something else.  It was only flat.  It curls up like a California sea urchin.  Hey, I'm surprised I didn't say, madam, is that leaven bread?  Or did your pussy fall out?  Get it. 
[02:50:00]  Get it.  Is that a loaf of challah?  Or is that leaven bread?  I fucked that one up, too.  I was about to do it again.  Are you women in their vaginas?  Yeah.  Anyway, Bill Burr.  Right, I need...  He's still on.  We've been cutting him off for 20 minutes.  Hey, Bill, where's game seven?  It's gonna be in Boston.  I can't take that.  You're still holding in.  20 minutes of cunt jokes.  That's a lot.  You're gonna give me points.  How many points?  Well, whatever the spread is. 
[02:50:30]  What's the spread?  Modrin.  Oh, Jesus.  The spread is an old lady's pussy.  Yeah.  That's what the spread is.  Don't let it simmer down.  Spread the fall down.  Yeah, the net falls down.  Post-menopausal fuzzy-faced fucking bitch.  You get to cut down the net.  You get to cut down the net.  That's awful.  Oh, they get fucking velour face.  Yeah.  Fucking Sylvester Stallone is hitting her pussy in a meat locker.  There you go.  I'll take any bet you want to do, Bill. 
[02:51:00]  What the fuck?  Game seven.  What do we got?  Oh, 100 bucks.  100 bucks?  That's easy.  100 bucks and the spread, though.  That's what we were saying.  What's the spread, Vic?  You know spread?  I'm going eight.  I'd guess eight, but I don't have my phone on.  Give me ten points.  I can't believe it's not butter.  That's not funny.  That's a product.  No.  Define out what this.  There's no way that spread is ten points.  I said eight.  Where do we go for spreads there, Vick Henley?  Might be six.  Something.  Something spreads.  RegenerateGambler.com?  Yeah.  It was there.  Person with a problem, Dot Atlantic City? 
[02:51:30]  My mother played pinnacle.  Let me see.  I'm getting numbers here, but it's like fucking seven.  Danny Sheridan is the Vegas odds maker.  I said eight.  All right.  I was close.  Seven?  Give me the spread.  Is that true, though?  You're just making shit up?  I'm going back to my look.  Yes, sir.  Anthony, you know, I told you I bought that old truck.  Yeah.  I need another car.  Things to shit.  And the horn doesn't work, and I have drum brakes out here.  Drum brakes.  Oh, boy.  How old is this?  Yeah, so when I swerve, it's literally like a battleship. 
[02:52:00]  So I finally got the frigging horn fixed, and I was so excited that I could tell somebody  to go fuck themselves again, right?  And somebody cuts me off, and I go to lay on the horn, and all of a sudden, you know,  I take my hand off, and all of a sudden, I hear somebody, like, behind me just going,  like, beeping at me like I fucking did something.  And it took me, like, three seconds to realize that it was my horn, and it was stuck.  Nice.  You know what I'm talking about?  I'm feeling like a fucking tool shit. 
[02:52:30]  I'm stuck in traffic, and my horn is going, so I have to pull the handle, like, the horn  back to make it stop.  And every time I go to turn, I got to lift the thing off.  So I'm sitting there going, quack, quack.  Oh, you have to hold it back, you mean?  Right.  Yeah, because it's kind of old-school, like, uh...  Yeah, it's like a bar.  It's like a curved bar in the steering wheel.  Not when the connection happens, right.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And I actually drove by my apartment complex, because our neighbor downstairs hates how loud 
[02:53:00]  we are.  So I had to drive by it.  My girl's looking out the window, and I went to a neighborhood.  I didn't know anybody, and I, you know, was holding the thing back, and I just finally  just said, fuck it.  I pulled over, and longest walk ever, the second I let go, to get out of the car, get  under the hood, and figure out how to fucking unplug it.  Nah!  I'll stay-at-home moms with their kids waking up from the nap.  That's always such a...  Oh, you were the asshole, definitely. 
[02:53:30]  I'll do the Patrice jokes here and say, that's how we feel about your act.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  Vic, I'm just saying.  We were talking about Patrice and man.  You don't like Bill, bro?  I love Bill.  I'm just saying.  I love Bill.  Bill's wonderful.  Nothing.  We've had a history.  God damn.  What are you going to do with that truck?  How old is that truck?  It's a 68.  It's great.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a fucking...  That sounds cool.  Come on, mate.  I would drive that shit. 
[02:54:00]  But it's a constant project.  Yeah, I know that.  You don't just drive one of those like you do a new car.  You got a fucking...  Sounds cool.  Come on.  No, that's basically what you sign up for.  Yeah.  It's part of the deal.  Yes.  I've done all goddamn shit about cars since owning that thing.  More importantly, where are the gamblers at?  Why can't we find the fucking point spread on this shit?  It should be in the newspaper.  Someone said 5.5.  It's in the paper.  Flip over to the sports page.  Or hand it to the paper to me.  I can find it.  The great thing, Anthony, is I learned how to unplug a horn.  Yeah, what is it?  You just unplug it from the little curly horn thing underneath, right? 
[02:54:30]  The little curly horn thing.  That's the mechanical term.  Yeah, there's like one of those little flat fucking...  Yeah, right.  One of those flat plugs.  Pull that fucker out.  The little curly horn.  What's that?  It's just like unplugging your phone.  Yeah.  Yeah, you just unplug it and you know what you...  But then you feel fucked up because you don't have a horn.  Oh, I didn't have one before.  Believe me, dude.  The embarrassment was over, so I was actually excited.  I didn't bring my glasses also. 
[02:55:00]  We might be talking six points there, Bill Barr.  I was going to guess six.  You're going to give me six points.  Game seven.  That won't stink too bad.  It's a pot cage, dude.  They're going to win.  They're going to win.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Oh, you want the points back in the room?  Oh, here it is.  Great radio.  Vic Henley looking for points.  What else are we going to do?  You can't read.  I'm blind.  I don't have my glasses.  You can't read. 
[02:55:30]  That's what we're learning today.  What game do you mean?  What game is this?  You can't read.  Celtic Sixers, game seven.  I don't like you people with your oily hair.  You can't read.  You and your whole fucking family.  Heat, Spurs.  I see Spurs, Spurs, Heat, Marzzi, all the baseball.  I don't see it.  Spurs is going to be tough.  It's five.  There you go, five.  Five points.  Fuck you.  I got six and a half coming in.  Five points.  Celts by six and a half.  Five points it is.  Nah.  Over-under is 182.  I got it.  I got it.  Kevin from Connecticut says the Celts got 6.5. 
[02:56:00]  Five points.  All right.  So split the difference and, you know.  Let's go six points.  Six points.  Five and a half it is.  I got six and a half.  Let's go six.  Yeah, give him six.  I'll read the five points, Brad.  Let's go six.  We've got to come more your way.  It's six and a half.  It's five my way.  So we go up.  That's five and a half.  No, it's five and a half one way.  Six and a half the other way.  You can't go five and three quarters.  There's no such bad.  Yeah, let's go six.  One and a half.  He's lowering it.  What the fuck is going on over here?  Let's go six. 
[02:56:30]  What the fuck is happening?  $40.  I'm not lowering you $30.  What do you mean $20?  What's that from?  That's the old joke.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the old joke.  All right.  I'll give you six points.  100 bucks, six points.  Wow.  Six points.  Look at you.  Let's go 200.  Oh, wow.  Sassy.  All right.  I'll go 200.  I'll make that money back that I did when DeRosa actually did those push-ups.  Oh, dude.  Oh, nice.  Yes, he did.  That's a touchy situation.  DeRosa did push-ups?  No, he didn't.  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't think he could do any.  Officially, he won the bet.  I'm not a sore loser, but fuck, man. 
[02:57:00]  The judge deemed those push-ups.  I understand.  And that's it.  Oh, wow.  We all saw the video.  He didn't even come close to doing one.  You know the push-ups the trainer's got me doing now?  You fucking have to lift your hands off the floor.  Nice.  So you go down.  You can't just go like, you've got to lift your hands off the floor and then go back.  Right.  Lift your hands up.  So you're down, completely down to your chest.  How do you lift them?  Wait, you lift them.  Oh, you're not doing a little hop.  You're like when your chest is on the floor, you lift your hands.  Chest on the floor.  Lift your hands up.  Fuck you. 
[02:57:30]  Now go again.  It's fucking hard.  That's a push-up, Joe Rosa.  No, you didn't, Chip.  Fuck you, I did.  Fuck you.  You're out of shape, Chip.  Fuck you, Chip.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  This has got to be entertaining for somebody.  Fuck you.  Nice being.  What are you, shave with a rock or something?  Fuck you, motherfucker.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Angry, nasty Chip.  This is not even fun anymore, Chip.  I don't know what happened.  Hey, you're not fun.  Oh. 
[02:58:00]  Got me.  Got me.  Hope you're drinking poison.  I am.  All right, Bill, a lot of five and a halves coming in, Chip.  So six is fair.  We're going to go six.  We're going to go six for $200.  I made five up, by the way.  I totally made five up.  I know you did.  Oh, did you really?  I didn't know.  I don't know what's happening.  I just said five.  I don't know what's happening.  Well, we were in a lull waiting on the Alabama boy to read.  That was our first problem.  That was scary to look at.  What do you expect?  I'm a hillbilly.  I'm reading something?  You might need glasses.  I do need.  I don't have them with me.  I didn't think literacy was required for this show. 
[02:58:30]  Bill, while we have Bill Burr on the phone, Toucher and Rich in Boston just talked about  your Philly rant.  That thing will not go away, man.  Well, that's legendary, of course.  I know.  You guys, I owe that to you guys somehow.  I know someone has a really good copy of that somewhere.  I know it.  Didn't the production team fucking record shit that day?  Even though it's only a few years ago, phones are so much better now.  In this couple-year jump, cell phone videos are astronomically better than they were in  2006.  If someone wasn't hitting record, we had fucking cameras rolling. 
[02:59:00]  Going out of a limb there.  I like that.  It's all stadium.  All right.  You know?  Phones now are better than they were in 2006.  That's very nice.  Basically, what happened was my mouth opened and noise fell out of it.  We're all sitting there like, oh.  We learned something today.  That really wasn't stopping the presence for.  Yeah, all kidding aside, we're moving forward.  Fucking boring guy I am.  Oh, wow. 
[02:59:30]  All right, Bill, we're in.  Six points, 200 bucks.  All right.  I don't feel good about this bet, but I got to do it for Philly, I guess.  What's the spread, Jim?  It's fucking thousand bucks.  Yeah, apple butter.  Yeah.  It's not the spread.  What's that?  I love apple butter.  What's the spread?  Bed spread.  Oh, damn.  You know what I said, Donald?  No double guns there?  Double guns.  There you go.  Fuck about this shit. 
[03:00:00]  Fucking chip.  Had it with him.  Hey, Big A, your last name should be S.S. Hole.  Motherfucker.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Whoa, the gloves are off.  He didn't even do anything.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  Fuck you.  Hey, Bill, what about the LA Kings?  You in or out?  I just do the thing.  I love the Kings, but I hate Laker fans, and I know it's going to make some of them happy. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  So, but then again, I'm just right now, I'm kind of just rooting against the Rangers, is  all I'm doing.  Oh, absolutely.  Just because I hate how they act like Madison Square Garden, where they call it the, what  do they call it, the world's most famous arena?  Yeah.  You know, I hate self-appointed nicknames, like Hockey Town, King of Pop, you know what  I mean?  And just the way they say the most famous arena, they didn't say facility and cover everything. 
[03:01:00]  It's kind of like when I used to do stand-up, when I used to get college kicks.  When I used to do stand-up, you've stopped.  What happened?  Breaking news, you're retired.  No, no, no.  I used to get college kicks all the time.  Now I'm just this old, balding redhead, so they never book me.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck, man?  It was like a community college, they somehow figured out what they were number one in, you  know what I mean?  Yeah.  So I feel like that's what Madison Square Garden is doing, by saying arena. 
[03:01:30]  They didn't say forum or garden.  They got a loophole there.  Well, you know what's a really bad one?  It's when you go to Trenton, New Jersey, the sign on that bridge says, Trenton makes,  the world takes.  Is that the fucking worst?  I understand that.  Self-applaud.  That's horrible.  That's horrible.  Yeah, it stinks.  You know all the factories left, whatever they made is made by, like, an eight-year-old  right now.  Yeah.  Sure.  With one arm and a foot. 
[03:02:00]  There's a charcoal line.  I'll take it.  He's a chick.  Yeah.  What?  It's kind of lonely when that happens, isn't it?  Now, before 10 a.m.  Ever again.  Doesn't Trenton have some kind of fucking, like, claim to fame also?  Hoboken, when you come through right there, not Hoboken, over at home, it's like the embroidery  capital of the world.

All of them were working for a nickel, and so they found that, and they went, oh, we  can steal shit from famous movies?
