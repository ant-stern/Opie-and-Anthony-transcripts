<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and Anthony discussing their impending Thanksgiving break and the anxieties surrounding potential repercussions for taking too much time off.  Opie recounted a busy weekend including a bar gig, poker, and Laszlo recording a podcast in his basement using Opie's equipment. They also celebrated the success of their recent sold-out Atlantic City show.  The conversation then devolved into crude commentary about their respective sports teams â€“ the New York Jets, Houston Texans, and the struggling New York Islanders, with suggestions of sabotaging an Islanders game with feces.  The Brett Favre nude photo scandal and the NFL were discussed, alongside various callers' opinions on different teams and players.  A significant portion was dedicated to a scathing review of "Grown Ups," with callers and hosts criticizing the film's humor and acting, followed by similar criticism of "The Blind Side" and its portrayal of race. The segment ended with a skeptical discussion of 3D television and a brief mention of their podcast's popularity and past content.

The next segment started with a discussion on the thinness of modern flat-screen TVs, quickly shifting to a review of a Harry Potter movie, focusing on a semi-nude Emma Watson scene described with graphic language.  They then discussed their alma maters, with one host expressing extreme disdain for his college and recounting a negative experience with a professor, while the other revealed an alumnus was involved in a large child molestation case.  A trivia game followed, guessing the most dangerous city in America, eventually revealing St. Louis.  The hosts then discussed crime rates, a shooting in one host's old neighborhood, and viewed his former apartment building on Google Earth. The conversation then unexpectedly turned to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C., with detailed descriptions of its emotional impact, followed by a caller's account of visiting Hiroshima and the aftermath of the atomic bombing.  The hosts discussed the bombings, their effects, and the actions of both American soldiers and Japanese civilians.  The segment concluded with a discussion about TSA airport security procedures,  a caller's experience at Auschwitz, and further criticisms of TSA procedures, including an argument in favor of racial profiling, and a Polish joke. Mad Dog briefly interacted with Opie in the hallway during this segment.

The following segment focused heavily on TSA pat-downs and body scanners, with frequent use of highly offensive language. The hosts and callers debated the procedures' effectiveness and invasiveness, particularly regarding potential health risks and humiliation, specifically mentioning the experiences of pilots and a bladder cancer survivor.  A significant part covered the case of Ward Bird, who received a lengthy prison sentence for brandishing a gun on his property, with debates on the fairness of the sentence and the circumstances of the incident.  This was followed by a humorous yet derogatory segment mocking Joan Baez's fall from a tree house, using offensive language and stereotypes. The segment also covered the story of homeless former boxer Iran Barkley, and a discussion about Bob Dylan's "Alice's Restaurant," interspersed with offensive jokes and comments. A caller, Scott from D.C., shared a story about his gun ownership. The segment ended with a brief discussion about a photo of Tom Cruise on a building and a mention of E-Rock's wedding.

The final segment showed a series of videos depicting high-altitude activities, including window washers, a person high on a radio tower (believed to be Tom Cruise), and teenagers on a girder.  The focus was on a video of two tower climbers ascending a very tall transmission tower with minimal safety equipment, prompting highly profane reactions from the hosts and guest Jimmy.  A caller who worked in this field shared similar experiences. The show concluded with a discussion of E-Rock's wedding, including anecdotes about Eastside Dave's antics (wasabi, microphone, and chair-throwing), the brevity of the ceremony, and details about the attendees and their interactions.  This was followed by a graphic discussion of Sam Roberts's sex life, prompted by Jess catching the bridal bouquet.

I don't like taking off the day after Thanksgiving  Yeah?  Alright  We're cuckolds  Because we shouldn't even be here  Really?  Most of the big shows are off this week  All week?  But for some reason we feel like if we miss  Two days in a row 
[00:01:30]  The company's gonna get rid of us or something  I don't know  I don't get it  Yeah, low self-esteem show, right?  Yeah, this is the low self-esteem show  Please  Please want us show  The please want us show  Exactly  Yeah, so we got, you know, Thanksgiving coming up  And it is Monday  But yeah, it feels like a Wednesday  Yeah  Calculate it like that  No, it feels like a fucking Monday  It feels like a shitty fucking Monday  My voice is shot from Friday 
[00:02:00]  I see that  Had the gig over there at Bar 9  It was fun  It was a bunch of screaming and yelling  And not even the singing part  It's just sort of trying to talk to people in a bar  So how are you doing?  What?  Yeah  And a bunch of friends that I knew from like years ago  Showed up?  Friends when I was fucking like seven years old  How the fuck did they figure out that there was a Bar 9 gig?  My brother told them  My brother still keeps in touch and stuff  So back to my house  Poker game 
[00:02:30]  You know, party  And didn't go to sleep until like eight in the morning  Yesterday?  No, it was a Saturday  Saturday?  Like Saturday morning  Saturday morning, gotcha  And then slept Saturday until about 3.30 in the afternoon  Well, that's not that bad  That's not at all bad  No, that's not bad at all, man  But my voice is still like shot  I got something for that  Oh, do you?  You might not like it  Protein, high protein injection  Yeah  Give a good squeeze  I'm going to take it orally  Yeah, it's just something about you going 
[00:03:00]  Oh  Then Laszlo came over  Saturday and did a  Live from the Compound show  Oh, nice  Because, you know, he's allowed to do a show from my basement  You just watch somebody else use your equipment?  Yeah, I got to watch somebody do  A podcast from my basement  On equipment that I'm not allowed to use  Jesus  It's just  Oh my god  It's just stunning  I heard from  Managio Mente  Yeah  That  They're talking about it  And seeing what can be worked out 
[00:03:30]  Whatever  Stuff  So I hope one of these days  To be able to  Go into my basement  And actually just talk to a couple of hundred people at a clip  Whatever  It might be fun  Let them make believe they know what they're doing  Fucking idiots  Can I thank the fans very quickly?  No  Yeah, what happened?  Our show sold out in 30 hours  Wow  So thank you to the fans  The Atlantic City show  Yeah, that was huge  Nice  I read that tweet  Yes  Just wanted to thank you  People are asking me if there's going to be another one  I don't know  Can you take that on tour?  I don't know 
[00:04:00]  I mean  You certainly could do it in Boston  There's other cities that I would love to do it in  Cleveland would probably, you know, get something done  A lot of it would depend  Oh yeah, I didn't think of Cleveland  It would depend on Jim's bills and Dave's schedule  Because all of us draw in AC  So it was like four people who draw all  It just sounds like a great show  It is  That's actually what I'm very happy to be on  Absolutely  It just feels like a great show  And everybody's different enough  Where it's not like four of the same guys  Yep  Wow  A sellout in 30 hours  I couldn't believe it  How many seats?  200? 
[00:04:30]  250 seats?  It's actually a little less  It's a 125 with the curtain  Oh nice  Intimate crowd  Yeah  That's about 2,700  How many?  About 2,700  Jesus  Or 2,500  It's a huge thing  That's awesome  The fucking Jets  My J-E-T-S  Jets, Jets, Jets  Mine too  I was eating a big Texas fucking shit sandwich yesterday  That Twitter's rough when your team is losing  You get your ass kicked  Yeah 
[00:05:00]  And then I had to deal with Lady Trucker  Because I guess out of nowhere she's a football fan  Or she likes the Houston Texans  Why?  I don't know  So she's running her fat fucking mouth  Yes, she'll do that  At one point I just wrote  Eat shit, fatso  That's all I had  Because my team was getting beat  She sure takes it well, doesn't she?  Yeah, I don't want her to take it well  Because she knows it hurts  Fucking pig  She should have run her fucking big rig off a fucking cliff 
[00:05:30]  And she tries to congratulate  She does catch him shit  Then she's trying to congratulate me on the big win  I'm like, I had nothing to do with it  I'm just a fucking fan  And why are you congratulating me?  Go away  Congrats  Congrats on the big win  That's three weeks in a row  I'm not pulling it out of a hat  As they say  With mediocre fucking teams  Yeah  I know what's going on  Because then people are beating me up  Like  Is that what they said?  Pretty much, yeah  That's what I see 
[00:06:00]  When I try to read the tweets  But the Jets could easily be five and five  I'll acknowledge that  Yeah  But they're not  Very easily  They're eight and two  They're not  They said, you know  A win is a win  That's right  And they'll take it all the way to the Super Bowl  But then you take a peek at those Patriots  And you're like, oh boy  We might be in a little trouble  Oh boy  But we've still got a few games to get everything together  In time for the playoffs  Yeah  That Manning's a choke artist  Again  Again  The Pats beat the Colts  That was a great game 
[00:06:30]  Is he a choke artist?  I watched that in the gym  That was an amazing  Yeah, he is  Interception  That was great  All he had to do was  Set up for the field goal  And take his chances in OT, man  Of course he choked  Does he normally choke?  He's been  I think he's been known to choke here and there  Yeah, absolutely  And then your dumb cowboys won too, Jimmy  Dumb cowboys  Yeah, I was happy  When I don't watch, they win  That's the way it works  Yeah, well, they got a two-game winning streak  With the new coach, right?  That's right  What are they, three and six?  Three and six  Two game  Three and seven  Sorry 
[00:07:00]  Yes  My favorite team stat, though  Is it got to be the Islanders  Oh, you had to bring it up  I have to bring up the New York Islanders  Why?  Thirteen in a row  That lost  It doesn't hurt as much  Thirteen in a row  Because the Jets are doing so well  Yeah, but wow  Thirteen straight losses  Thirteen  Straight losses  And they lost to the Thrashers  Oh my god  Not good  Huh?  Not good  No, not good at all  Although we're the worst team in hockey  So I guess there's no surprise if any team beats them at this point 
[00:07:30]  Yeah  I'm telling you, that bag of shit is going to hit the ice  I'm done  The bag of shit  I didn't forget  A big, fucking, steaming bag of shit is hitting that ice  I should put a bounty out there  The people would just cheer  Of course they would  Crazy because they are so fed up  You know, if you want to see something  Kind of  Something you don't see often  Tune in  Yeah  Tune in the next Islanders game  There is so many empty seats there  Empty seats? 
[00:08:00]  It's got to be half empty at this point  If not more  Yeah  It's got to be 60% empty, I would bet  So  That's got to be a great night out  Sitting there watching your team lose with fucking  Fifteen other people in the stadium  With your Capital One coffee  Yeah  Your Capital One popcorn  Oh, really?  And your tickets that went up again this year  Knowing they had not the greatest team they were going to put on the ice  And they started off pretty fucking hot too  Yeah  And now they only have four wins for the season 
[00:08:30]  Now they stank  I don't know now  Fucking  What is it?  More than 10?  I mean, oh yeah  It's like 16 or something  12  12  And four in overtime  Oh, right, right  Four and 16  Right, four and 16  Total  Yeah  Yeah  Amazing  Season's over  It's not even Thanksgiving  They play until May, Anthony  The season is over  It's done  It's done already  They're done  You still have to go through winter and spring  Yeah  I still got to go through two seasons 
[00:09:00]  Hey, what happened with Vic last night?  Was he good?  I went to bed early  I was exhausted  Yeah, I think he  I know they won  But how did Michael Vic do?  He rushed for a touchdown  He didn't throw any  He was far more human  I guess  He's a ground guy  Yeah  That's it  Yeah  I mean, he wasn't  Yeah, he didn't go nuts  They won  Oh, yeah  Everyone just fucking completely forgot about that dog  He could be the MVP  That dog thing  He is the greatest  He would go from jail to MVP  He is the greatest 
[00:09:30]  I'm so hoping that happens, too, by the way  I think that would be great just for dog lovers everywhere  Oh, my God  Yeah  They would hate it  Let's say hi to Mike in Boston  Mike A  Mike  Good evening  Hello  Hey, congratulations there, Mr. Norton, on your show  Oh, thank you, buddy  All right  I just want to talk about the Pats for a minute here  You know what frustrates the shit out of me?  They look awesome  Every single game  Coming, like, first and second quarter  Fourth quarter 
[00:10:00]  They just friggin' fall apart  No matter what they have for a lead  It's always a close game  They just friggin' fall apart  The Jets scare me  Probably more than the Pats  And scare you  Well, we're gonna  I'm hoping that we  We get to kick your ass  If you guys just got a solid quarterback  Sanchez is good  But if you guys got, you know  A high-caliber quarterback  Then you guys would be friggin' unstoppable  I gotta talk for the Jets fans  I think we're very happy with Sanchez  He's come a long way, man  No, he's good  He's young, though  You know, give him another year or two 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, he's young  But, you know, he's not falling apart  He's winning these games  That he probably shouldn't win  He's hanging in there  Making the big plays  The big plays  The big plays when it counts  It was fuckin' Holmes again, too, yesterday  You're 8-2, brother  Brother  You're 8-2, brother  Danny's saying that the attendance at the Islander game  Was 9,157  That's what they're claiming  That number's always lower  Yeah  That's paid attendance, they call it  Guess what? 
[00:11:00]  I'm paid attendance  I didn't go  You didn't go  And there's a million guys like me  That have their season tickets  That didn't go  I'm eating tickets at this point  And then I'm amazed  That people actually want my tickets  I'm like, I'll give them to anybody  I don't care  Yeah, they just want a night out  Really?  Yeah, it's a night out  To watch minor league hockey?  Minor league, yes  The bag of shit is gonna hit that ice  I'm telling you  I can't wait to see that  I'm telling you  How do you want it done?  I don't know  Because the shit's gotta come out of the bag 
[00:11:30]  Onto the ice  Well, not necessarily  Because I'm hoping  If the bag of shit hits the ice  Then the charge will be lesser  Oh, okay  Maybe the charge will be lesser  It'll be known by everyone  That it's a bag of shit  That hit the ice  As long as everyone knows it's shit  That's what I'm saying  Yeah  What kind of bag?  It's gotta be a clear bag  Clear baggy  Big one  Like a nice sandwich bag?  Big one with a lot of shit in it  It's gotta be a lot of shit  But how do you get the shit  Into the Coliseum? 
[00:12:00]  Well, you could probably  No one's gonna frisk you for it  Oh, wait  Or you could hold in your duty  And then get it done  In the bathroom  Or take it done  Fresh  Hot off the presses  I am the biggest idiot  Because this whole time  I'm going through the scenario  How I get this shit  Into the Coliseum  Wait a minute  I already have it on me  Smuggle it inside you  Right  And then you just let it out  In a big Ziploc bag  What if you're like  Can't get the duty out  You gotta really like  Commit to it a few days in advance 
[00:12:30]  And just hold it in  And just hold it  Hold it  And then  Let it rip  Fuck  And then  It's  Wow  It's pretty sad  And then  Wow  Alright  What about Brett Favre?  Brett Favre?  He did great, huh?  Bruce in Minnesota  Bruce!  Morning, boys  Hey, man  Yeah, that was a great performance  31-3 playing the Packers  That guy needs to fucking quit  And be done  And retire  And call it the end  I think Brett Favre  Well, he already said 
[00:13:00]  That he's not coming back next year  Which means he is coming back  He's setting up for the big drama  How long  How many times are we going to fall for that  I don't know  Crap with him  Because he'll  You know  He'll hang around to see if he could  You know  Get with a team that might  Have a real shot at the Super Bowl next year  Yeah  Even being maybe a little backup guy  Wait for the  We were supposed to be the fucking dream team this year  Remember?  Getting him back again  We paid him $20 million  To go 3-7  Wow, that's worse than the Islanders losing streak 
[00:13:30]  If you think about it  That's got to be the worst  That's bad  That's way worse  So  And they're  I guess the NFL are getting some experts  To see if the cockpictures are real  Really?  That's still going on  Experts?  What kind of experts?  They're doing like SIM card checks  And all that stuff  Why?  My guess  I think they're stalling  And they want Brett Favre  To finish out the year  They don't want to fuck his consecutive game streak  Right  And then knowing that  Most likely 
[00:14:00]  They probably sat down with Brett Favre  And Brett's like  Look, I'm retiring at the end of this year  And then by the end of the year  It doesn't matter as much  It won't matter  He'll have put in his time  Right  Cut in his record  Right  Yeah  Because why are they taking so long?  Also because if she sues  Or if there's a suit against the NFL  Or the team  They probably want to have  They probably want to know everything too  It's probably got something to do with the lawyers too  Yeah  I'm guessing  But they're checking the SIM cards?  Yeah, they're doing all kinds of  To find out where the photos came from  They'll find out 
[00:14:30]  It's easy to check  Yeah  Hey Brett  Pull your fucking pants down  And let's compare this shit  Let me see your short-headed cock  Short-headed  That little fucking helmet  Oh, that rotten  Rotten little shit is  That frisbee helmet he's got  It's terrible  It's from being tackled all those years  It does look like a fucking frisbee  It's horrid  All right  Let's say hi to Trucker Dan  Trucker Dan  Love you guys  Love the show  Thank you 
[00:15:00]  Trucker Dan  Trucker Dan  Trucker Dan  That's right  A couple thoughts this morning  About Brett Favre  And the Green Bay Packers  First of all  Four in a row for the Packers  Could be the second week in a row  They get a coach fired  So that's pretty impressive  Brett Favre  Seeing him with the Vikings right now  Is like seeing your ex-girlfriend  That you still really kind of  Care about a little bit  With an abusive asshole boyfriend  There's nothing you can do about it  It's like you look at this guy  And you go 
[00:15:30]  What a worthless sack of shit  That would be the Vikings  And then you just want to  Just beat the shit on him  But you're with another chick  You're happy  It's like fuck Brett  Why did you do this  You know  I don't know  Anyway  I just had to share  That's pretty good  I mean he ruined his legacy  Yeah he kind of did  With the Packers  I mean  Yeah  But now you're kind of  Liking him again right  Trucker Dan  You know  Brett's always going to be  The man for Green Bay  Because he was the one  That brought us back  From the ashes  You know 
[00:16:00]  I mean  But  Boy there's no doubt about it  You know  We miss him  But Aaron Rodgers  Is definitely doing a job  For us man  There you go  Alright brother  I forgot that  The Pack  They won four in a row  What's their record  Cool Pack goal  What's the  What's the Packers record  Anyone  Anyone  Green Bay  Seven and three  Seven and fucking three  For the Packers  Alright  What's the Jets record  Eight and two  Could very easily be 
[00:16:30]  Five and five  I'll say it again  Every team that wins  The Super Bowl though  Has games they should have lost  That's the way it is  That's three in a row  That they could have easily lost  Two miracle finishes  That was great for  Ending yesterday  And then the Lions  In overtime  Oh my god  Yeah  I didn't see yesterday  As well  You didn't see  It was  It was pretty amazing  The Texans came from behind  Which was frustrating as hell  And then  Last second  Like  Throwing deep  Yeah  Going deep  And it actually worked  And they even said 
[00:17:00]  Like last week  The blah blah  The Jaguars  At the last second  With the Hail Mary  Yeah  And I'm like thanks  You just jinxed the Jets  By saying that  But  But it fucking worked out  What else is going on man  Great job  I'm fucking tired  From fucking jet lag  So  Don't mind me  It's gonna take another day or two  Yeah  Japan and back in three days  Is fucking insane  It's a long fucking flight man  Yeah  Yeah  You gotta stop Hawaii  Huh 
[00:17:30]  Yeah somewhere over there  Somewhere somewhere over there  I just stayed on the plane  And slept  Some fucking island  In the middle somewhere  Yeah  We flew in from Poughkeepsie  I have jet lag too  I'm very tired  Big Poughkeepsie  That's a long flight too man  Sure is  Because you have to go through Chicago  We flew through Chicago  And there's a layover in Dallas  And then we came back  Is there anything worse than taking a flight  Where they take you a whole different direction  It's not even close 
[00:18:00]  No I want to go that way  Why do we have to go  It's usually Chicago too  Why do I have to go to Chicago to go south  I haven't even started my trip yet officially  There's nothing worse  Or if you gotta go to Chicago  But you gotta go to Atlanta first  Right  Wait a minute  What am I doing  Because it's their hub  I don't give a shit  Give me a direct flight  Please  Reacher in Niagara Falls  Reacher  Hello  Reacher  What's up buddy  Oh I've got a solution for this shit on the ice for you 
[00:18:30]  Oh good  That bag of shit has to hit the ice  Yes  Okay you need a small sandwich bag  Wow  Yeah I know that  Okay  I need my ass  I got that  What  You make whatever kind of cocktail you want in that thing  You need to leave it open just a little at the end  Throw it high  Let it land on the ice  Splatter  And then that warm shit  In the cold ice  Make a nice steam  Steam  I think people are getting into this 
[00:19:00]  The steam coming off of it is key  But I want a hard log  And I want the bag to open up as it hits the ice  And then it just kind of dramatically rolls  A few inches  And leaves like some brown track as it rolls  I want it to dramatically roll out of the bag  Oh that'd be great  I can't wait to see you boys  Alright Reacher  Thank you  See ya  God everybody  Space Trucker  Kentucky  Good morning  I see a pattern here  Wasn't that sex for Sam thing really good for your career 
[00:19:30]  Why don't we do a shit for Sam and let him lob it  Wow  That's a bust  I don't even understand  I don't quite  Oh S's  S's guys  Sex for Sam  Shit for Sam  I do  Your phone's cutting out  Alright bye  What'd you say?  Oh he  He bailed  Okay bye  What'd you say?  We heard you

[00:20:30]  Very relevant  But for male prostitutes  Yep  That's fucked up  Of course  Because he can't  Come out for condoms  Any kind of birth control  Between men and women  He can't do that  Because you know  The Catholic Church  You're not supposed to use  Any kind of birth control  But the Pope is rallying  Around male prostitutes  Around male prostitutes  Of course he is  Why wouldn't he  Yeah yeah  Because he says  The AIDS  It helps protect  Against the AIDS  He doesn't  Condone  Their lifestyle 
[00:21:00]  But he said  It could probably  Save some lives  How about the Pope  Just stop talking  Who gives a shit  What do you think  I'm just tired  Of him  And I'm tired  Of the Islamic  These imams  And all of these  Religious people  Could you shut the fuck up  Because you know why  They're irrelevant  They're irrelevant  All of them  In this day and age  Stop it  You see I saw  Something on Drudge  Where some religious people 
[00:21:30]  Are saying that Harry Potter  Which you know  Broke all kinds of records  Made a shitload of money  Is opening a gateway  To Satan  For the children  Like they're watching  These movies  And somehow being brainwashed  Into satanic rituals  It's a fucking movie  It's a goofy movie  It's a fantasy world  Stop  Like we've always had  Yeah  Stupid  But they  You know  You get these irrelevant  People talking 
[00:22:00]  Their ancient babble  Right  And other people  Are you know  Well  If the Pope said it  I'm a Catholic  So I have to agree  With the Pope  What do you  You gotta sit there  And agree with  With a book  That people wrote  A thousand years ago  And fucking  What does it mean  Well believe  Believe in what you want  But I mean  To think that  These kids are gonna  Get all weird  Because they're  Checking out Harry Potter  Movies 
[00:22:30]  Is ridiculous  The Harry Potter  It's completely ridiculous  Speaking of movies  I had some people  Over over the weekend  So we rented a movie  And we  They all got on the plane  In Japan  To watch a movie  That's so bizarre  No I was  I was back  For the weekend  Oh oh oh oh  Oh  It was a quick fucking  Back and forth to Japan  I sold some shit  To a Japanese TV show  You'll see  You'll see  And we decided  To rent a movie 
[00:23:00]  We couldn't find  Anything good  So we actually  Rented Grown Ups  Please watch Grown Ups  No you didn't  Please watch Grown Ups  Is that Travolta  Robin and  No man  It's the Adam Sandler  Kevin James  Chris Rock  Fucking Rob Schneider  I could not  David Spade  This is the biggest  Piece of shit movie  I could not  Even think about  Watching that  Please rent Grown Ups  The trailers  It is uncomfortably bad  There's a few scenes  With some slapstick comedy 
[00:23:30]  That always works  You know  We learned that  A long time ago  With the Three Stooges  So of course  Some of that will work  But the story  The acting  It's horrendous  I think Adam Sandler  Got a bunch of his pals  And said  Hey you guys want to  Go on vacation this summer  And we'll film a movie  While we're at it  That's what it looked like  Know who was the best  In the movie  And I'm not kissing his ass  Colin Quinn  Actually looked like  He was playing the part  He was supposed to play  Yeah  Yeah  The other guys  They were just calling it in 
[00:24:00]  And Kevin James  Has to be  The biggest fucking loser  In Hollywood  The guy's got to be  Close to a billionaire  And he accepted a movie  Where they just make fun  Of how fat he is  Oh is that the guy  That was his whole role  Yeah  Fat jokes for Kevin James  Why would you accept that  In a bad movie  I don't get it  Have you seen it Jimmy  I have not  No  I don't really watch comedies  Well I don't enjoy most of them  Well if you watch grown ups  You still haven't watched comedies  Because it is horrendous 
[00:24:30]  How bad this movie is  And David Spade  I guess he gave up on hiding  His fucking hair plugs  Or whatever  His hair was pulled  You know  Pushed to the side  And you could see  The horrendous  What looks like  A bad dark scar  Right on the top  Of his forehead  He got the old school  Well there's been rumors  For many many years  That he's fucking  As bald as they come  Oh really  Oh yeah  And that's all fake hair  Is it that  Or is it like  One of those  Things John Travolta has  Where you staple it on  Or something  I don't know  That weavy thing  That's got like 
[00:25:00]  A gauze almost on it  And then they  Spackle it into your head  How does that stay on your head  Because Travolta's  Look pretty good  With cum  From your fucking lover  That you're kissing  On the plane steps  I would imagine  Some kind of glue  The glue  You glue down  The mesh  And then you could  Attach whatever you want  To the mesh  I'm thinking  But the water doesn't  Mess it up  Or  Maury's wigs don't come off  Even in the water  I don't know  But this  That fucking movie  And it did  Ridiculous 
[00:25:30]  Ridiculous numbers  Yeah  Andrew in Virginia  Hey what's going on  What's up brother  Motherhuckers  Yeah  Alright  Wow  That movie was  Fucking awful man  It was the corniest  Fucking movie  I've seen in the longest time  All the fat shit  With the boat  And all the  Even the stupid shit  With the little girl  Where she's like  I want to get chocolate wasted  Yeah  So I fucking  Kick that little girl  In the face  The whole movie  Was just a piece of shit  And then Rob Schneider 
[00:26:00]  The gag there was  He's in love  With a really old woman  Which could have been  A funny quick little laugh  It was played out  They played it  Through the entire movie  Oh great  The entire movie  To the point  You wanted to scream  At the TV  We get it  I don't know  How  How you watched that  It was awful  They just rounded up  I think they just  Rounded up those guys  And tried to make  Some quick money  Off some stupid  Family bullshit  And you always know  When  Like Chris Rock  Is one of the funniest  Guys alive  And he fucking  He's saying lines 
[00:26:30]  In this movie  You're going  He would never say that  And why did he accept that  He knows what fun he is  So when they're handing him  These lines to say  Why is he saying  Okay  Yeah alright  I'll do this  I guess  I guess the money was good  Yeah I only ended up  Watching it actually  Opie  Because you were talking  About how big  Of a piece of shit  It was  Well I didn't know  It was a big piece  Of shit officially  I saw  I saw some scenes  And some trailers  And I made my opinion  And then I saw the reviews  But then finally  We decided to sit through it  Yeah  And then it got to a point 
[00:27:00]  Where oh my god  I want to watch  This entire piece of shit  It was one of those movies  Now I have to watch  This piece of shit  You gotta watch it Anthony  Please do  No  Please  I won't ever watch that  And all of a sudden  David Spade is now  Kind of a Chris Farley type  What do you mean?  He was kind of like  The partier in the movie  You know how Farley  Used to play  Yeah the goofball partier  What is that about?  I ain't ever watching that  Huh?  I'm not watching that  Why you gotta  No fucking way 
[00:27:30]  There are certain movies  I just will not watch  I was watching  A movie came on  It was just on my TV  I came downstairs  The TV's on  A movie was on  Right  And it was that  Blindside movie  With the big giant  Oh that was a terrific movie  Black fella  Yeah  She won for that  Yeah yeah  Did you see when she went  To the fucking hood  Yes  And threatened all the gangbangers  And they got scared of her  Did she? 
[00:28:00]  Because that's  Because that's what would happen  In real life  She had a tiny short skirt  And high heels  And she was packing  In her little fucking  Ten thousand dollar purse  Did you see that scene?  Please tell me you did  I didn't see the whole movie  So I missed that scene  She scared the shit  Out of the gangbangers  Yeah like that would  Ever fucking happen  Let me ask you  I didn't see it  But that movie struck me  Like she won the Oscar  Because it struck me as  What white people  See themselves as  With blacks  Like these heroes  Who save blacks 
[00:28:30]  Is that what it was?  Like a self-congratulating  White person movie?  It was completely that  And I just got a few laughs  Because this big dumb  Fucking big Mike  The guy that is  The black guy  Yeah  He's walking in a playground  And like two little girls  Are on a swing  And they turn around  And look at him  And they jump off the swing  Hold hands and run away from him  Yeah two white girls  Like he's a monster  Yeah  Because he's a monster  Of course  Because he's a monster  You've never seen this?  And then  You should see Blindside Jimmy  And then Sandra Bullock's 
[00:29:00]  Like friends  Are sitting around at the table  And they're all  Like you know  Upper Crusty  At this restaurant  And they're talking about  This  Oh sorry  Sorry Tom came in  Sorry Tom  Tom came in  Of course  Our black intern  Frightened Jimmy  We've been taught  To be scared of black people  Tom I'm sorry  Yes  From a very early age  We're trying to get over that  We're learning lessons  From the Blindside  Very sorry  Yes Blindside  It will teach us  She's with her 
[00:29:30]  Highfalutin friends  And they're all like  Oh you're taking up  Another project  You know  Aren't you afraid  Of him being  Under the same roof  As your daughter  And then she has  A talk with the daughter  And it was just like  This whiteness  And big dumb black guy  It really is  It's whoever  It's that mentality  Of white people  Their attitude  About blacks  Like most white people  Think they're just  Big dumb animals  But I'll go in there  And take care of them  And show everybody  That they're  I'll show my humanity  By teaching everybody  His humanity 
[00:30:00]  Yes  And I didn't even see it  So maybe I'm just wrong  No you're not  That's exactly what it was  It was like  Freaking King Kong  But you swear to god  He's just  Giant guy  Woman  Trying to you know  Teach him things  You missed the best part though  When she goes to the fucking ghetto  I saw when she went to the ghetto  The first time  She kind of rescues Mike  Because Mike gets confused  And goes back home  And uh  I mean this ghetto  Why does he get confused  Is he a retard  I don't remember  He's just a big  I think cause  I think cause 
[00:30:30]  Wait maybe I do remember  Cause then  Uh there's accusations  That they actually  Brought him in  Uh not because  They loved him  Because he  He was  Gonna be a great  Football player  Right  And they were trying  To help their  Alma mater  Their alma mater  Nothing I hate more  By the way  Than alma mater  An alma mater  Let it go  Alma mater  Let it go  So that she has to  Go to the ghetto  And rescue him  And go no  That's not it  We really do love you Mike  I know it sounds  It looks a little  Strange here but  Which I think 
[00:31:00]  That's the  The real story is  Okay  That they brought in  A black kid  To help their  Alma mater  Yeah  But they had to  Like jazz it up  For Hollywood  I'm not buying  This shit that  They actually felt  For the kid  Totally  They got something  Out of it too  You kidding me  At first they were  Freaking out  Like you know  Hey he's too stupid  To be in the school  Right right  And then of course  The testing  They gave him  An oral exam  So he didn't  Have to write  And he was just  So smart  They just couldn't  Communicate  Properly 
[00:31:30]  But they figured  A way around that  Because he was just  A smart kid  After all  But she pulls up  In whatever  Like a Mercedes  She comes out  With designer glasses  Like a fucking  You know  Top of the line  Handbag  A short little skirt  And high heels  And goes right up  To the gang bangers  Saying that you know  If they don't do  The right thing  She's coming back  And you know  And basically  Shooting them  And they got all  Scared  And let her  Just say and do  Whatever she wanted  And leave the ghetto  I gotta see the rest of it  Please see that scene 
[00:32:00]  They probably just  Would have said  Shut up bitch  Yeah  Oh yeah they would  Get your white  Fucking ass  Out of here  Bipping on her  They would have  Gang raped her  Need your motherfucking  Sandra Bullock ass  Over here motherfucker  Exactly  Why don't you go  Look at your husband  And shit  He fucking utter girls  Yeah  That's my impression  Yeah  Utter girls  Terrible impression  Let's say hi to Joey  Joey  Hey Joey  Hey Joey  Hey that fucking movie  Chronos  My wife keeps  Putting it in the  Disc queue  From Netflix 
[00:32:30]  I just go in there  And remove it  Classic  But some of  I watched that  Hot tub time machine  That was another  Piece of crap  Piece of shit  That was a bad movie  Too  It could have been good  It started out  Kind of alright  They could  They could have  Fucking took that  To town  They didn't do shit  With that movie  Well you got  You got to see  Crispin Glover  He's great in  Whatever he does  His role in 
[00:33:00]  Hot tub time machine  Was great  I like Crispin Glover  He's crazy  Cause he's a fucking  Whack job  Thanks guys  That's all I got  Alright man  It certainly is  Bobby Bigrigger  Bobby  Hey what's going on  Hey Bobby  Hey  Jimmy happy birthday  Thank you sir  Now that whole bit  In that movie  About the breastfeeding deal  I mean did they beat  That dead horse  Okay yeah  He's talking about  Grown ups  So you have a  How old was the kid  Five  Six maybe  Five or six year old 
[00:33:30]  Breastfeeding  Yeah  Now if it's done right  You can see where  You might get a laugh  Out of that right  Yeah  I mean let's be honest  We could be a little  Open minded  That could get a laugh  In a movie  Yeah  And then they pounded  That into the ground  The entire movie  Is breastfeeding  I need milky  Mommy where's my milk  It's like  We got it  You did the joke already  And then the baby bird  Nursing the baby bird  Back to health  By the woman  Breastfeeding the baby bird  It was  Alright we get it  Give me a break  If it wasn't for the fact  That it was in the discount rack 
[00:34:00]  At the truck stop there  And I picked it up  Discount rack  I don't even know  What you're talking about  Right now  But yeah  That was a piece of shit  But these guys  Are supposedly  You know  Big huge  Fucking  Comedy stars  In Hollywood  But you know what  And this is where  I question my own taste  Because  It's not my style either  But those movies make  120 million dollars  And it's like  Crazy money  The ones I like  Make 40 million or less  Oh I know  Like they know something  I don't  It drives me nuts  I know my taste 
[00:34:30]  I think you just get in  That publicity  Machine or whatever  The big Hollywood  Publicity machine  And a lot of the public  Were just a bunch of  Lemmings  They're sheep  And we just kind of  Marched to the movie theater  Because we're told  This is a good movie  And we sit through it  Dummies  What did it get  On Rotten Tomatoes  There's no fucking way  People enjoyed  Grownups as a whole  I'm sure there's  Some people that did  Yes  But no way  As a  You don't think  There's that  Like when you leave  A bad movie  And you hear people  Like oh that was good 
[00:35:00]  Oh that was funny  I want to punch him  In the face  I really do  Yeah  I love going to  Some of these  Hyped up movies  And then the credits roll  And yet there's always  Some asshole  And I wish it could be me  But I'm not a loud guy  In the theater  That's it  What the fuck  All of a sudden  They just burst out  And get pissed off  Because they were expecting  Something way better  They made 162 million  At the box office  A hundred and  That's box office  Then you got the DVD  And all that shit  Look at this shit  10% rotten 
[00:35:30]  10% positive reviews  By critics  From all the critics  Across the country  And then 62%  Of the movie goers  Like this movie  So I'm completely wrong  What is wrong  With these people  But doesn't that show you  How completely  Most times  Especially with comedy  Most times  Critics are completely  Out of touch  With what people like  But I would love  To beat up the critics  This movie is horrendous  How bad it is  Yeah  I have to defend  The critics on this one  I might even beat them up  I'm just saying  They're a step off  From where people are  Well they don't really 
[00:36:00]  Need much from their movies  I guess  62%  That's 6 out of 10 people  Like the fucking movie  I was loud guy  In the movie theater  During the back to the future  Your theater?

[00:40:00]  It was high school  And then he went to college  I don't know  I missed the ending  I'm going to say  She was a booster  Was she?  Yeah she would go up to the coach  And like tell the coach  How to coach him  Oh I forgot about that  Yeah remember that  Yeah yeah  Because the coach is yelling at us  Because that happened in real life too  And he couldn't really play football very well  But he's just a big guy  So Sandra Bullock walks up to the coach  Because she's really fucking  I know  She's in charge  I know it's a true story  But the guy comes from a broken home  And they're making it in the movie 
[00:40:30]  Like they just love this kid  And brought him into their family  And I'm saying that's bullshit  That was probably part of it  But they also saw  Holy shit  This guy's an NFL athlete  Got some potential  And we could help our alma mater  Alma mater  Because for some reason  These people get so bored  They just want to help their alma mater  After they graduate  Dude I hate people that like  Are concerned with what their old college is doing  Oh they're all about the booster  Move on  The booster club  Yeah  Well you know I was  Well you know we gotta keep  What are they called

[00:50:00]  They're fucking  The marketing is bullshit  Cause what they  What they got on the screen  Of course it looks like  Amazing 3D  Yeah  I was seeing some diver  In the water  Muff  With a shitload of fish around them  Yeah  You know what I mean  And it was all blue  Of course  A nice blue hue  And you put the glasses on  It's like  This is amazing 3D  Of course  Yeah  I wanna see it when you're watching  Like a stupid 3's company rerun  Well I don't think it would be 3D  Right  True  But you know what I mean  Like some  Who gives  You know what I mean 
[00:50:30]  Does it look good  Right  If it's just showing up  It looks amazing  But what  A shitty show  But they're setting it up nice for you  Yeah  With this diving  Scene that has  Has nothing to do with regular TV  They  They made this  Specific scene  Just to  You know  To try to sell the 3D TVs  I'd love to see the 3's company in 3D  Though you see  You see Larry's  Fucking hog  Coming through the letter thing  And Jack's sucking it  Fucking Audrey Lindley's clit  Oh god  Wants to see that  Mrs. Roper  Yes Mrs. Roper 
[00:51:00]  Her leathery asshole in 3D  Oh just coming out  From under her moo moo  That she wore  Norman fell  And so did Jack eventually  Oh boy  He sure did  Hey  Have you checked out the 3D TV  No I have not  I have not checked it out  I don't know  I mean I want to see it on regular shit  And I was at Best Buy yesterday  I didn't  I've seen it  I'm just  I'm not overly impressed  No  At all  It's just  I'm not either  Plus with those freaking glasses  Like they're annoying 
[00:51:30]  And they don't feel good  And if you wear glasses  Like it's awkward  Because then you have to try to put  These fucking 3D glasses  Over your glasses  That's the best  Here you go  Eight eyes  Watch the movie nerd  They should make it in context  Because then it would  It would feel  It would feel better I think  Plus and a lot of the glasses  Have batteries  Like you have to turn them on  And shit  It's just fucking annoying  And they're not compatible  With other makers  So if I have a Sony  And you have a Panasonic  And I want to come over your house  And watch TV  But you don't have an extra pair of glasses 
[00:52:00]  I can't just bring mine over to you  Well if you have a 3D TV  You better buy a lot of glasses  For people coming over  That's true  Yeah yeah  How much are the glasses?  Imagine you just make everyone  Watch it regular  And you're sitting there  Enjoying the 3D  You're like laughing  And going whoa  And everybody's just watching the movie  So Danny you've seen it  You know what I'm talking about  Where they set up something  That of course looks great in 3D  I mean I haven't watched it at length  But like from what I saw  I was just kind of like  Alright  Right  I wasn't like blown out of my fucking chair  I was more suspicious  I gave it a couple years  Where they're perfectly 
[00:52:30]  Yeah you got it  They're not  The first generation or whatever stuff  Is never the best  And I think  It looks like watching an animated magic eye  You know  Like with those little shitty posters  That's a great  Where shit kind of comes out at you  It's just like picture that  But it's motion  My stupid diving scene that I saw  Was like magic eye  All of a sudden it came to life  Like oh here's the diver  It's not like there's  Like there's depth  Like there's like perspective and depth  But nothing is actually 3D  It's like a bunch of layers of flatness  Flatness  Okay  Alright  So you're not getting like 
[00:53:00]  Yeah  That's a great way to look at it  Wait till the TVs are curved a little bit  You know  Maybe they won't happen  I don't know  Maybe that won't happen  I don't know  Why would you curve your TV  Again I don't know what I'm talking about  Okay  I love it  Then again they probably  You probably suggested  Laughing at you  You probably suggested 5 years ago  That TVs become flat  And we probably laughed at you too  You did  My 60  It's officially 63 inch TV  Can't be more than an inch thick  I know  It has a picture on it  It's got to be a half inch thick  It's unbelievable 
[00:53:30]  Isn't it great  Can you move your sofa back  Huh  Because I know the living room layout  Oh yeah  You did right  Like there's a feather  All the way back to the window now  But you don't feel too close right  No  JJ  Harry Potter  What do you got on it  Hey  It's actually not a bad movie  It's very dark  Very sad  It's  They should lighten it  They kill a lot of the characters off  It's like  Pretty much  They're wrapping up the book series  So they do kill a lot of people  It's actually not bad  And there is an  Emma Watson semi-nude scene  I heard about this  Side tit and side ass 
[00:54:00]  Side tit  Side ass  Heard about this  Heard about this  Is that  Yeah one of the characters  Starts hallucinating  He's in love with  The Emma Watson character  So he starts hallucinating  That she's  Messing around with Harry Potter  And  You know they're entangled  All  Mude  Mude  Mude  I like the Harry Potter movies  Mude-y  It's actually a  Pretty good movie  If you like the books  It's actually the closest adaptation  Of all of them so far  It's actually not a bad movie  Do you like the Harry Potter movies 
[00:54:30]  The first one was a  Total kids movie  But after that  They started kind of making them  Where the adults could enjoy them too  That's the only one I saw  Was the first one  Oh really  And then you were out  And then I was out  The difference between the first movie  And these later ones  It's night and day  Yeah  It really is  It's a lot darker  But I'm just like  You know  I don't think I could be bothered  The movies definitely grow up  With the characters  Yeah  That Emma Watson is alright  Huh  Yeah  Even with the dyke haircut  I don't mind her 
[00:55:00]  You don't like  Alright JJ thanks  Pasty English  Just the way I like them  Guys are just  Guys are just assholes  Why  We just  I feel bad for women  They have to tolerate us  What do you think  She's alright  Even with the dyke haircut  We are pieces of shit  Men are just turds  I want to know more  About the alumni Jimmy  I don't know anything else  I really don't know enough  I would never acknowledge them  If we start  A nice college song maybe  It wouldn't help

[01:00:30]  I do  No you don't  Who is it?  Twisted Fate  Fuck  Twisted Fate  Everybody  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  I like this song  I want to congratulate  Newark, New Jersey  Anthony  What?  Actually no  I'm sorry  Camden, New Jersey  I always think Newark  But it's actually  Camden, New Jersey  Was the most dangerous  City in America  Oh what happened?  Newark's got to be  In the top ten though  Right?  I would hope so  Camden, New Jersey  Is no longer 
[01:01:00]  The most dangerous  City in the U.S.  Really?  You want to guess  Which city is the most  Dangerous city  In the U.S.  Without cheating  Detroit  I would go  Is there like a top ten?  I'd like to see  The top ten of this  I'd like to see  The top ten most  Dangerous  No  Because I'd say Detroit  It's cold in the D  But they're not  The most dangerous  City in America today  As we wake up  There's a place  More dangerous  Than fucking  Camden and Detroit  Yes  Alright  Let me think this out 
[01:01:30]  It has to be  Very  I would say  People that are  Low income  Well  Very low income city  You want a really good  Hint?  Yeah  Really good hint?  Yeah  We would look at this  Place as a very  White place  Really?  Oh yeah  Heaven?  Jesus  I think the average  Person would look at  This place as a 
[01:02:00]  Very white  City  Or a white  Yeah  White city  In general  Hmm  Is it in the north  Or the south?  Um  It's um  Hmm  That way  Ha ha ha  That way  It's that-a-way  West  West  And a little north  Chicago  Chicago  No  Oh  Does it uh  Does it have  Hmm 
[01:02:30]  Is it uh  Do people go there  For like vacation?  No  Atlanta  But they have  Something there  That people like  To check out  When they're there  Oh really?  One of those like  Things  Like a ride?  Yeah  Hmm  No I don't know  If it's a ride  San Francisco  Okay  The most dangerous  City  Beating out Camden  Camden is no longer  The most dangerous place 
[01:03:00]  And I think  The average person  I'm saying  Would look at this place  As a very white city  Philadelphia  Obviously they're uh  Philadelphia  Their ghettos  Are really bad  But  No  Not  Philadelphia  No  Um  Boston  Nah Boston  Can't be that bad  Uh  Can't be LA  Flint, Michigan  Most dangerous city  In America  Flint  Not anymore  No one's there  Um  I'm gonna guess  Saskatchewan  That's just a bad guess 
[01:03:30]  Historically  You give up  Can't be  And you can beat me up  For my clue  If you don't agree with me  But I think you might  Agree with me  Alright  Uh  Uh  Uh  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Um  Let me think  I have a hint  Oh you do  It's  Hey did you like  Did you like my hint  Yeah it was a good hint  Alright good  It's regarded by many  As the best baseball town 
[01:04:00]  In the country  I was gonna do that  But that would've  Gave it away  Youngstown, Ohio  Not really  I think that would've  Gave it away  I don't think so  No  I'm not looking  Down or anything  Best baseball city  In America  Cleveland  And  Most people would think  It's very white  Because of that  That's where I get  My knowledge from  You don't see a lot  Of darkies in the stands  Very white  So it can't be like  Louisiana  Somewhere  A city in  Louisiana  Best baseball city 
[01:04:30]  Is it in the state  Of Louisiana  Where's that  Oh I know  I know  It's not  I do know  I do know  Yes  Kansas City  Damn you're wrong  I know  Oh  Those are terrible  Baseball players  I guess Travis  That's a very good hint  Put those two things together  Uh  St. Louis  St. Louis  St. Louis  Is the most dangerous city 
[01:05:00]  In America  And most people think  It's a very white place  Because when you watch  The Cardinals  There's a lot of white people  In the stands  Extremely white people  Wow  St. Louis  St. Louis  St. Louis  Is now the most dangerous  Fucking city in America  Oh they got  Beating out Camden  New Jersey  Got that big arch there  Yeah  So you got  St. Louis  Is one  Camden is two  Detroit  Is three  Flint Michigan  Is four  And then Oakland  Oakland  Oakland  Oakland  California  Is five  I would have 
[01:05:30]  I'm surprised  I didn't say that  Oakland's a  Badass place  Is it  Fuck yeah  Yeah  Yeah a lot of  Gang activity there  And just  For the numbers  St. Louis had  2,070 violent crimes  Per 100,000 residents  Compared to the  National average  Of 429  Wow  Jesus  That is a hell of a place  What's going on in St. Louis  2,070  Party  What the hell's going on there  Oh a lot of crime  Is going on there  I hear you 
[01:06:00]  There was a  Nice little shooting  In my old neighborhood  Of Central Islip  Long Island  Really  Yeah apparently  And this  Never happens  There was a  House party  Going on  With a lot of  Black folk  At this party  And it ended  In gunfire  That does happen  Frequently  Oh  Literal  Jim  Yeah  I  When I was living  In Central Islip  It was 
[01:06:30]  Pretty hardcore  As far as  The white  To black  Ratio  And black people  Just not really  Liking the white  People  They were  Beating them up  And now  It's just completely  Out of hand  With gangs  And everything  Where's Central Islip  I really don't know  I'm a Long Island  It's just  Center of East Islip  It's just a little  East of West Islip  Alright what's the next town  It's  What's the closest town  East Islip  And  No not an Islip

[01:09:30]  Oh boy  Like their son  Was fucked up  But they  They were really patriotic  They had American flags  Everywhere and everything  And then the mother  Once my brother said um  Said uh  Uh  Hey how's  How's your boy doing  In Vietnam  And the woman  Looked at my brother  And goes  He's not a boy  He's a man  You have to be a man  To fight and kill  Ugh  Like just yelled at my brother  My brother's like  Oh okay  That's why you shouldn't  Be neighborly ever  Don't be neighborly ever  You creep  Bunch of assholes

[01:10:30]  And he'd come walking up  Like with just this  Look in his eyes  And his face  Devoid of emotion  Like his mother would be like  Sweetie  And they're hugging him  He'd like have his arms  To his side  And just like  The guy was  Fucked up  Maybe he was faking it  Just fucking with everybody  I don't know man  I don't  He saw  He obviously saw some shit  I think he was in  What they call  The shit  And man  He was fucked up

I don't know  Agent Orange  Maybe he got killed in the war  Oh shit  The Agent Orange  I know there was one guy  This is fucked up  Like he used to  He was like this hippie guy  And he used to invite my brother over  To play guitar  And shit like that  He would smoke weed  But I think my brother  Was a little too young 
[01:11:30]  To smoke pot  Who the fuck knew  Though maybe he was  And uh  He was like the most  Hippiest  Long hair  Just fucking off  Kind of guy  And uh  His name's on the fucking wall  Oh really?  Oh yeah  He got drafted  Sent over  Boof  Blowed up  You ever see the wall?  Uh yeah  Yeah  Fuck yeah  It brought tears to my eyes  It's uh  It's crazy  I have no problem admitting that  You go there  It's like fucking  You check out the wall  It's just too many names  You just look and it's like 
[01:12:00]  Oh my god  It starts out as a tiny  Little one inch wall  Yeah yeah  Little thing  And then you're in the middle of it  It's what  80 feet high  Whatever the fuck  Does it get bigger?  I have a  That's the whole thing  That's why it's so dramatic  It's like each side of it  Is thin  And then it gets just huge  It doesn't start with the year  In the middle  So the first couple years  Is not many deaths  And then it gets huge in the middle  It's  You're getting  Are there names up there  You can't read  That you can't get to?  I don't remember  It's been a few years  But I do believe yes  A lot of people take rubbings and stuff  It's like what was it  50  53,000  54,000  And there's always an old vet there 
[01:12:30]  Just bumming everyone out  He's just  Bumming everyone out  Guys sitting like Indian style  Looking at a name  Just talking to it  Right  Hey man  You're just bumming us out  It's like  You just look and go  That's a lot of fucking names man  Yeah it's  There's the vet  That's just bumming everybody out  Just bumming everyone out  Look at that shit  He made it  The other guys aren't there  All jokes aside man  That fucking wall  Brings you to tears  Crazy stuff  What's he holding up do you think?  A piece of paper  And then you take a pencil 
[01:13:00]  Oh  And you do a rubbing  So you get like the impression of the name  Yeah cause the names are  On the paper  On the paper  Yeah  So you get a  Get a little  Fucked up shit  You've never seen it Jimmy?  You don't even know if these  I've seen it but I've never been there  Next time you do a gig in DC  Do yourself a favor  Check it out  It's one of those things that  You gotta check out  It's unbelievable  How tall is the wall right there?  17 feet  17 feet  How do you take rubbings off the top?  No it's probably about  12 feet I would guess  Maybe you gotta go on top  And then lean over  I don't know how it works  Can you take ladders?  I mean like people 
[01:13:30]  A lot of names can't be seen  Yeah I guess so  It's for the effect  You understand what's going on  Big time  Yeah it's pretty twisted  I'm sure you can get a stepladder  It's kind of embedded into the ground  The whole thing  Oh yeah because from the back  It looks just like the lawn  Yeah it's the lawn  And then you could fall off  And kill yourself  You sure can  Have people committed suicide  In front of that thing?  I'm sure  Probably have  I'm sure  Is that how long the line for the wall is?  That was probably like the  Grand opening  Whatever they call it  People just keep walking through it  They're walking through it right now 
[01:14:00]  Unveiling  Grand opening  I'm sure there's a homeless guy right now  Peeing on the wall  Oh god  Disrespect  Because they're not open for  True business yet  Disrespect  Do they open 24 hours a while?  I guess  It's in a park  I like checking out all that shit down in Washington  War Memorials  Yeah  Pretty cool  I found a couple like  In my hometown  I was in a park  And shit from like World War I there  Really?

[01:19:00]  Holy fuck  I hear  This is fucked up  I hear it's so evil  There's just a low tone  Wherever you walk  I was reading stuff  On Dr. Mengele  And one of the things  He would do  They were testing out  How to warm troops  And they would just  Take people  And put them in water  And then strap them  To a stretcher  Outside in the winter  Until they were almost  Frozen to death  And then bring them  Back inside  And put them in  Like hot water  Oh that was nice  Trying to warm  To see  Of course a lot of them 
[01:19:30]  Died doing that  But they would try to see  What was  And sometimes they put them  Through three sessions a night  What's the best way  To warm soldiers  It's fucking  Just horrible  Wow  The whole country  Should have been nuked  I really believe that  Wow  Well it pretty much was  If you look at  Post-World War II  Berlin and Germany  The entire country  Was a bombed out mess  The  Yeah  Our incendiary bombing  Did a lot more damage  Than the A-bombs did  In Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Just regular  Incendiary bombs 
[01:20:00]  On Japan  Right  Just burnt for  Fucking weeks  Firestorms  Hundreds of  Thousands of people  Just burned  Civilians  They targeted  Like civilians  Thinking like  They knew how crazy  And fanatical they were  Yep  And they knew  If they had to invade  Japan  That these people  Not just these soldiers  But civilians  Would grab  Sticks if they had to  And fight  We didn't want that  So  Civilian targets

[01:21:00]  Had brainwashed them  So much  That the Americans  Were animals  That never get  Taken prisoner by them  Because they will  Do horrid things to you  That they jumped  Off cliffs  Grabbing their children  And just jumped  Off these giant cliffs  To their deaths  Or huddled together  With a grenade  And just  Blew themselves up  Because they didn't  Want to be taken  Prisoner by the  Evil Americans  And then the ones  That did surrender  They got the food  And shelter  And treated nicely  Oops  Jumped off the cliff

[01:23:00]  What's going on man  Great show  A little history  In college  Went to  Had a teacher  Who was in Vietnam  He was a SEAL team guy  Or whatever his story was  But the wall  Was developed  By an Asian woman  Who was in college  It was a contest  That was handed out  And the first person  Killed in the war  Name touches  The last person  Killed in the war  It comes around  In a complete circle  First and last  Dying  Meeting at the top 
[01:23:30]  Of the wall  Pretty powerful  Oh at the top of the wall  I don't see a circle  When I go down there  Explain that  Well it goes  It goes from the center  From the center of the wall  When you walk down  And the two highest points meet  Right  It starts there  On the one side  Working out  To the one point  And then at the  The next point  On the far end  Picks up the name  Cycling back down  Into the highest point  Of the wall  Meeting at the top  Where the first 
[01:24:00]  Was killed  Very confusing  Sir  I have no  I have no idea  Your description  It's hard to follow you  It was horrible  Well  I mean  Yeah  Wait  I mean  I'm trying to  It's  It's  It basically  If you've been to the wall  If you haven't been to the wall  You're not gonna  You're not gonna be able  To visualize it  But when you go to the wall  Fuck us running  I've been to the wall  Yeah  I can't visualize this  Okay  Well  You know the wall  Anthony  You know how the biggest 
[01:24:30]  Panels are in  In set down  And it's kind of like  Two arrow points  Heading out  Yeah  You got me  Yes  Yeah  Okay  Gotcha  We're trying to focus  Go ahead  I got you  Well it's early to focus  I know  No  But you got us all  We're all focused  Touches the last person killed  And I think that's pretty cool  Is it powerful  I don't know  You tell me  Can we see the wall again Danny  We're trying to figure out 
[01:25:00]  Yeah he says there's a circle  Show the walls  I never saw a circle  Yeah  It's not a circle  That's not a circle  It's a V  But the cool thing about  The topic that I'm  Talking to you  Is first person killed  Touches the last person killed  Oh my gosh  I'm just going to say it again  Is it in the bottom  Or the top  The touch  It's at the top of the wall  How do you see it though  Right at the peak  How do they know  That was the first person killed though  Maybe there's another guy  How do you know that 
[01:25:30]  No recognition  For being  You know  They got him as the fourth guy killed  And he was actually  The first guy killed  Yeah wow  Look for the first guy killed  Vietnam wall  Maybe you see  I don't know  No we're just looking it up  You gotta get down there  Opie  If you haven't been down  You gotta go  What's an opening  What the fuck is an opening  Oh he said opening  He was all nervous  Yeah I'll go down again  Just check out this circle  The first and last  Yeah  First  Great  Like where's that touch  You got it  Take a look at it 
[01:26:00]  We're looking  We're looking  We're googling our asses off  Google it  Google it  Google it  Do you know what he's talking about  Not a clue  What that fucking guy is saying  You gotta go online  We are online  We got 80 computers in the studio  And not one person can figure out  No we gotta go online first  Gotta go online  I like to go in line  Yes  You go online  I like to go in line  My god  My god man

[01:33:30]  In battle  Yeah  But people stationed there  There's just something  So reprehensible  About the  The people  That could do that  It's a  It's almost  It turns into  Because I've  Seen a lot of shows  And actually done some reading  On the mentality  Behind  What happened  At the concentration camps  And  It was almost like  A feeding frenzy  That started  Between the soldiers  They got caught up  In what was going on  The power that they had  And 
[01:34:00]  It transcended  Just following orders  Which was  Of course it did  The Nuremberg  Defense  Of we were just  Soldiers following orders  It turned into something  Completely different  And  Yeah  Some hardcore  Motherfuckers  Following orders  Doesn't explain  Murdering  Civilian children  That are  For all intents and purposes  Prisoners of war  Or captives  You know what I mean  There's no  Just  There's no  Explaining that  They weren't even  Prisoners of war  But I mean

Yeah, they're all walking around  Like nothing happened  It's just like  Yeah, people are  I saw a show on Hiroshima now  And it's just, you know  Kids walking around with their  American haircuts 
[01:38:00]  And blue jeans  And they're skateboards  Yeah, and they're just fucking  You know, whatever  But I think there is  Like the  Right where the  The bomb exploded  They kind of kept that  Really?  As a memorial  Yeah  But everything else is built up, right?  Yeah  And then there's  There's a couple of places around  Where you can see like  The shadow of a guy  Burnt into a stoop  That he was sitting on  Like he was sitting on the stairs  And they leave that?  And yeah  They have a section of a wall  Inside the museum  That has a shadow  Can I see that shadow thing?  Shadows burnt onto it  What about the  Yeah, yeah 
[01:38:30]  Wow  The guy was  They got vaporized  There was just nothing left of them  And from the sheer heat  It just burnt  The image into the walls  How  Let me ask you  How big is the area  They left untouched?  Well, the bomb exploded  I think like 500 feet  Above the city  So the first building  That the shockwave hit  Or like the flame  Ball of flame  Is this building  That is  The skeleton of the building 
[01:39:00]  Is still there  No kidding, huh?  That is  Yeah, it's called  The Atomic Dome  Look up the image  It's a pretty popular site  And then  So around that area  I think there's maybe  Like two structures  That  Have been left  But otherwise  It's just completely  Built back up  There's a nice  Wand-wand  And they have a  A flame that burns forever  It's called the peace flame  When the flame goes out  Maybe they shouldn't have  A flame  Yeah, why would they  Go with a flame?  Ice cube  They have a big mushroom cloud  Do something with water 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, a lot of water  Please  Shit  I heard that people  Enough about flames  People who got  Hit with that  The thirst  I saw a documentary  On survivors  And they said  The thirst  Really?  Was so intense  Like people were just drinking  It's like you would drink  Oil  It didn't matter  The thirst was amazing  Do you think they had  Really bad headaches?

You're just minding  Your own business  And someone is coming  Into your property  And you do the right thing  And shoot their ass  And now you're doing  Three to six years?  Might depend on where he was  What was happening  Just a tease, I guess  Yeah  There was no shots fired  No shots fired?

[01:43:00]  You gotta give it to them for that  Yeah, all right  After that though  I was done  With the Red Hot Chili Pepper  I was done  I really was done after that  I had to take a quick piss  Yeah  And I only had like two minutes left  So going down the hall  Ran into the worst person  You could run into  When you're in a quick hurry  Mad Dog  Mad Dog's here  Hey, how you doing?  What's going on?  Oh really?  I'm like  I have two minutes to piss  Does he want to talk about 
[01:43:30]  The World Series now?  Now that it's over?  He gave me the quick brush off  Did he?  Yes  What's going on in his pants?  I don't know why  They're pulled up high  And I don't know  Does he have a  Big boner?  I don't know  Something going on  Does he have a boner?  What's that?  We were talking about boners  During the break  Boners  With the whole TSA thing  Yeah, the TSA thing  Is getting out of control  People that don't want to be scanned  By the big x-ray machine-y thing  Well, I think  I think it comes down to this  I think there's a few TSA agents 
[01:44:00]  That are out of fucking control  And they're on power trips  So now they've ruined it  For all the TSA people  That are doing the pat down properly  Are they?  And treating us like human beings  Are they?  Did they ruin it?  A few of them might have  But I'm sick and tired of the complaining  I'm tired of the complaining too  Thank you  You know, Americans bitch  That we want safety in the air  And then every step they take  We fucking whine  Yeah  Yeah, but what about the guy  That made cumzies in his pants  Or something? 
[01:44:30]  No, that was a  Look, you're going to have cases  Where there are asshole agents  A lot of them  And the pat downs  Look, some of them  Are very invasive  I'm actually on your side  I'm saying  Instead of fucking  Changing everything they do  You've got to slap  The fucking power trip  TSA agents  And get them the fuck  Out of their position  Absolutely  Don't confuse what I'm saying  I absolutely believe  In the pat down  And all that shit  But there's always some asshole  That ruins it for everybody else  In every profession  But  For the most part  They're doing their job  If you don't want to do the scanner 
[01:45:00]  Then you've got to get patted down  Here's my problem  Is the political correctness  That has fucked this whole thing up  When you look at a  Fucking child  Huh?  Being frisked  One kid  They took his shirt off  And someone  Has it on their camera phone  There's no reason for that  A family  That is going to fucking Disney  Right  There's no reason  To  Let them just walk  On the fucking plane  Without ever checking them  Let's start 
[01:45:30]  Profiling  Arab  Men  Let's profile them  Sorry  Sorry  But  Every time  There's terrorism  That's who's fucking doing it  And don't bring up  Timothy McVeigh  Shut up  Can I get  The other side of that though  Don't you think  They know  That we know  That they're doing it  So  When they try to find new ways  To get this shit done  I'm just asking  You know something  Let them try to find a new way  And we'll try to thwart that  Right  But the way right now  Is not frisking 
[01:46:00]  Eight years  Kids  It's not frisking  Families that are  Going on vacation somewhere  It's just  That isn't the case  And by the way  Here's what the people  Don't like about the scanners  I don't want to hear cancer  It's not cancer  It's squeamish fucking  Pussy Americans  Not wanting some screener  To see their penis  Or their vagina  Or their precious fucking tits  That's what it is  A country  The same country  That's fucking  Belly ached about  Craigslist prostitutes  Are the same fucking 
[01:46:30]  Progressive thinkers  That don't want  TSA agents  Seeing their dick and balls  Go fuck yourself  Want to look at my dick and balls  Go ahead  I don't want some savage  Taping fucking C4  Behind his balls  Right  Because you're afraid  Your little cock  Is going to be seen  Well Danny's got a great idea  He wants to go through  With a big huge  Viagra boner  Viagra boner  And then just  Tell the TSA agent  Touch my big cock  Go ahead  Grab it  Grab my fat cock  Squeeze my  My  Yeah 
[01:47:00]  Throbbing penis  My big stupid dick  Yeah  Hey  You gotta just  Feel my big stupid cock  I told Danny  He's gotta just  Book a flight  That he has no intention  Of going on  And just be in a  Royal pain in the ass  At the check in there  Have a big  Fucking Cialis rod  A raging  Throbbing rod  It aches  Touch my aching heart  Come on  The only disadvantage  To having total profile  You got a profile  But you can't rely  Completely on it  Because Chechnians 
[01:47:30]  Are Muslims  And they look white  So it's like  There are  There are different shades  That would get through  If you only did  Arab males  But you should use  Profiling more  Because I'm not worried  I'm sorry  I'm not worried  About a fucking  70 year old  White or Asian lady  No no  Or black lady  I'm sorry  I'm not  It's just not  Gonna  No  Boy you guys  Are gonna be surprised  When the next one  Is done by a big  Black woman  You know what  That's kinda right  But when it happened  On 9-11  By that point  We already knew  Yeah  Who the terrorists were 
[01:48:00]  We already knew  What they looked like  And it was exactly  Who we thought it was  Yes  They didn't surprise us  They didn't surprise us  In the  In London  In the  In the fucking  Subway bombing  None of them  Surprised us  But it doesn't mean  You can't search  White men  Or you can't search  Black men  Because they're also  Radicals  It's gotta be random  And it's gotta be  It doesn't  It's like  No you know something  No  You're wasting  Resources  By frisking  And running people  Through scanners  That obviously  Are not doing 
[01:48:30]  Anything wrong  But those scanners  Are causing cancer  And they're trying  To like  Well the pilots  Infect the masses  The pilots unions  Are all up in arms  Because they don't want  The pilots having to  Go through these things  Every  Yeah  Every  Because they're flying  All the time  Sure  So they're constantly  Going to be scanned  And the fucked up thing is  A pilot doesn't need a bomb  He's got the plane  Yeah I always thought  Yeah  It's like  Oh it was weird  Like watch out  What the pilots carrying  It's like  All he's gotta do  Is push on the fucking yoke  And the plane's going down 
[01:49:00]  What if it's not really  A pilot though  What if it's somebody  With a fake badge  Who looks like  Who's dressed like a pilot  Going through  And he has a fake idea  Fake credentials  What happens when the real pilot  Gets to the plane  No no no  Hey who's this guy  No but I mean a guy  Who brings something  If you don't give the pilots  Any search  Anyone could sneak through  Not any search  They have to run their  Their bags through shit  They have to do that  I mean  I don't know  If you see fucking  Amal  Dressed as a pilot  Pull him aside  If you see fucking  Mr. Roger Henderson 
[01:49:30]  From the fucking Marine Corps  Flying the plane  I love singing that  What happened  What happened to this guy  He was pat down  He was a  He's a guy  He's a blood of cancer  Survivor  Humiliated and covered  In his own urine  What happened there  That's where a case  With the TSA  There really is a lack  Of humanity  With these fucking  Cocksuckers sometimes  Like the guy said to him  He goes he asked  For a private area  They're like well  We don't have one  He's like well  I want a private screening  Because he survived  Bladder cancer  So he has a bag  And there's something 
[01:50:00]  On his chest  Covering it  So he's like  Look if you pat down  You're going to  Break the seal  He tried warning them  And they didn't want  To hear it  They were fucking  Assholes I think  Oh boy  And I think the guy  Was probably unduly  Treated a certain way  But it's like  Then you have to say  That's really sad  But what is the TSA  Supposed to do  When a guy comes through  With something on his chest  Right  How do you  It's like  Are we willing to take  The chance on being  Blown up  There's been an underwear  Bomber  Right  They're continually expressing  The desire to blow up planes  They're trying to figure it out 
[01:50:30]  This fucking  Unlocky  What's his name  Unlocky  What the fuck his name is  In Yemen  There are still guys  Calling  Yeah  For civilian murders  What do you want us to do  The next one's going to be  Tampons right  With the tampon strings  That you can easily light  This fucking  You know what  You're not crazy though  Into the vagina  Or into the anus  I don't mind being  Completely photographed  Through and through  Exactly  I was just going to say  This show has bladder cancer  Do you get it  Steve bladder  He's a cancer on our show  No I understand  I know 
[01:51:00]  I just keep telling you  I know  I just keep saying it  I know Steve  I like the fact that  Steve would come in  Because he looks like  Jughead a lot  And he just has  He has that weird face  He makes that smile  He does look like  Jughead  That's just  That's a picture  That's fucking funny  Oh god  Oh that's funny  Now guys  Yes  You didn't know 
[01:51:30]  Bladder looked like  Jughead  No I never made  That connection  That's the first thing  I thought of  That's hysterical  Jughead  Whatever  Great  So  Yeah  The TSA's patting  Everyone down  Yeah yeah  And people are  Scanners  And now there's  You're fucking killing me  There's 
[01:52:00]  There's these people now  That want to have  National opt out day  During the fucking  Busiest travel days  Of the holidays  What's that mean  Opt out  Where people opt out  Of going through the scanner  And have to be padded down  Go ahead  So it's like  The lines  At the fucking airports  Are gonna be insane  You're not hurting anybody  But your own travel schedule  Yeah yeah  The TSA doesn't give a fuck  They don't care how many people  They gotta fucking frisk  They're working eight hours a day  They don't care 
[01:52:30]  Yeah  You dummies  Let's hurt ourselves  To show them  Let's go through the scanner  You're not fucking  Believe me  You're not all that beautiful  They're not gonna be  Trading your fucking pictures  Squeamish  Little pussy Americans  Yeah  Afraid of their wieners  Being seen  Don't look  I feel violated  Really  You little fucking baby  Violated  Do you  Oh it makes me sick  Wait until they're bending over  And just fucking  Shoving two thumbs up your asshole  Spreading and looking 
[01:53:00]  For fucking C4  What they should do is this  They should have two areas  Of the airport  Not so I have to stand in line  For somebody who's opting out  You should have the right  To opt out  But there should be  If you go to this side  Of the terminal  It's opt out  That side of the terminal  You're on the plane  It's scanner  Right  So you wanna walk through  The scanner  You walk through  This way we don't have  To fucking wait for you  Yeah it's not like this  Oh who's opting out  Is it the guy in front of me  Great  Right  I don't care if people  Make their flight  Yeah  I fly fairly often  I'm not worried about 
[01:53:30]  The scanners  I don't  Pilots fly every day  Scanners  Scanners  You got the scanners  Yeah  Yeah pilots  Fucking  All right  Squeamish Americans  Don't want their  Precious genitals seen  That's all it is  Such fucking  We would have all  Such fucking prudes  Prudish  We all would have done  The scanner  September 12th  2001  Dude you're right there  We would have  Again  Everyone forgets  We all forget  They're all a bunch  Of douchebags  And that underwear bomber  Showed you  Oh it sounds great  That underwear bomber  Showed you  Yeah 
[01:54:00]  The length people  Are going to  Right  They are trying  They are using  Every loophole  Yeah  To try to get in  It's amazing how  Every step they take  To make Americans safer  Privacy advocates  Belly ache  Yeah  And like when  Jesse Ventura was in here  I'm like what should  They do to  Good police work  What constitutes  That's what we need  But they say things like  Gathering intelligence  But what constitutes  Good police work  We're all getting  On the plane  We have to be scanned 
[01:54:30]  How is that not  Good police work  Yeah  I would love somebody  To give a reason  As to how  How they should do this  Yeah  You tell me  How we should do this  If you want to opt out  And you're  You're fucking  Feeling violated  When they frisk you  Because they say  I guess they say  I'm going to have to  Touch you  Yeah  Under here  And this  And they tell you  Where they're going  To touch you  And  It's annoying  I've had it done  Believe me  It is invasive  And it annoys me  Yeah  Yes  Did they touch your balls 
[01:55:00]  No I wouldn't care  If they did though  Fucking give us a fuck  Shoot you  Bunch of baby balls  What do they make  Flying a little nicer  If they  Fucking babies  What do they make  Flying nicer  If they just kind of  Like gave it a little fondle  A little squeeze  A little fondle  A little shake  A little shake  Something  And the women  Are the only ones  That can frisk women  Right  Men frisk men  So it's not like  A guy is coming over  And feeling your tits  But wouldn't the women  Like friskers  Be lesbos  I don't know  If you were a lesbo  Wouldn't you go 
[01:55:30]  Hey I want to be  A TSA agent  And I want to like  TSA women  Are  You don't want them  Fucking touching you  That's true  They are some of the most  You will never see  Playboys  The women of the TSA  They are fucking  Heinous  Just awful  They are just cloning  Precious  In a lab somewhere  Exactly  It's fucking Precious  It's fucking  Over and over again  It's Big Mike  From fucking  Blindside  But we got to make  Believe Precious  Is beautiful  Let's not forget  Of course  She's a beautiful woman  She's a diva 
[01:56:00]  She's wonderful  Yeah she sure is  Can't wait to see her  Next movie  Which will be a complete bomb  And then we'll forget  All about Precious  I'm not willing  To  Realize that was a  One and done  I'm not willing  To plummet 20,000 feet  Because that's what  They're trying to  Blow aircraft up  In midair  With human bombs  That's what they want to do  It's crazy  They fucking walk into stores  With bombs strapped to them  They're willing to do that  And they're not doing it  The same way  They're not going to use  Pepper spray  And fake bombs 
[01:56:30]  Like they did in 2001  And they've caught people  They've caught guys  Plotting things  It's not like  Not a peep  Has been heard in nine years  Good police work  Once you get to  The fucking airport  Fucking Christ  You have to be  Searched  In some way  Shape or form  Whether it's a  Scanner  Or a TSA person  Frisking you  You have to be searched  So don't fucking bitch about it  I've been through the searches  I've been through the scanners  I've had the  The things 
[01:57:00]  I've looked at my laptop  I've had every element  Of the security search  You can have  I've dealt with  I fly often  Yeah  And I'm telling people  Shut the fuck up  Stop your belly aching  I'm not scared  Of going through the scanner  I'm not going to get cancer  A half a second  Through that  You know  I'm not vacationing in it  Yeah  Jesus Christ  But when you're falling  To your death  Out of a cracked open airplane  I'm willing to take that chance  Rather than watching  The fucking half the plane fall 
[01:57:30]  Yeah  While me and the rest  Of the first class cabin  Are continuing to go forward  For a while  I don't want to miss  My friends and coach  Of course  How horrifying  How horrifying would it be  If you looked behind you  And saw just  There's no plane  The sky  It's just an empty  Fucking  Oh my god  But people say  Dude if you're willing  To give up certain amounts  Of your liberty  Shut up  I don't give up my liberty  Or my privacy  I value it  I actually fucking attack people  For not valuing  Other people's privacy 
[01:58:00]  Yeah  Go fuck yourselves  You voyeurs  Go have you voyeuristic country  Staring at everybody's  Fucking private lives  But yet your genitals  Boy it's amazing  How these privacy advocates  Aren't fucking embarrassed  For Brett Favre  You don't hear one privacy advocate  Saying look  He sent that to this girl  If he sent it  Private  We shouldn't be looking at it  On the web  Not one of them  No you'll never see that  They're all voyeurs  They're all fucking  Gross little voyeurs  Very good  So that's what we got  Going on with that shit  Astards  Hey can we do the fucking story 
[01:58:30]  About the guy  Doing three to six years  I want to hear what the hell  The problem was there  Just too much going on today  What the problem was  And there was no gun involved  He was defending  How do you defend  Your own property  And then end up in jail  I don't know  Because a gun was involved  State law says  That Ward Bird  Must serve a mandatory  Three to six years  In prison  What  Gun was involved  A gun was involved  But there was no shots fired  Okay  So a gun's involved  He probably didn't have it 
[01:59:00]  Registered right  Unlegal  Maybe it was brandishing  What's going on  Now hundreds of people  In the community  Are turning out to protests  Saying not only  Doesn't the punishment  Fit the crime  But what Bird did  Wasn't a crime at all  What up Bird  We've all been led  To believe that  You can protect your family  And your property  And so  Supporters of a  Moultonboro man  Have gathered  To let their voices  Be heard  Free Ward Bird  Free Ward Bird  Ward Bird was charged  After a woman  Drove up to his farmhouse  Past more than a dozen signs 
[01:59:30]  Marking the private road  His niece says  She ran into the woman first  She says the woman told her  She was looking for  A certain property  That was for sale  So I did give her directions  To the property  She was looking at  But not toward Bird's house  Prosecutors say  The woman was lost  When she approached Bird's home  And that he threatened her  With a gun  By him brandishing  And waving a gun around  And at her  He had a pistol  Oh boy 
[02:00:00]  I'm uh  He's a dick  This guy's an idiot  We've all had that  Fucking dick of a neighbor  That's not what actually  Because that's the prosecution sign  Oh okay  Alright fair enough  Fair enough sir  Right now we stop it  Here to say he's a dick  Alright  He's that guy  We have an asshole  Make sure  You know  Your football doesn't land  On that guy's lawn  All that horseshit  And now we'll see  We all know at least  One of these guys  She was put in fear  Of imminent bodily harm  Supporters say  That's not true  They say Bird repeatedly  Asked her to leave 
[02:00:30]  That she refused  And he only showed  The gun to defend  His property  He didn't commit a crime  Nah  I gotta stop it again  To say this guy  Is a  No reason  Why was she  Refusing to leave  And he's  Come on  Because she's a little  Unstable  But you know  No reason to  Pull the gun out  On that situation  Jesus Christ  On a broad  On a broad  Just tell her to  Fucking get the fuck out of you  Get stiff armor  And what is he  With that no  Fucking trespassing  Hey stay off  What are you  A revenuer  You a revenuer  Come after my still  And my boys 
[02:01:00]  Enough  Put the gun away  What a dummy  Maybe he's a surveyor  I'm a surveyor  He didn't commit a crime  He defended his property  And we should be able  To defend our property  Now dozens in the community  Are tying yellow ribbons  Saying the mandatory  Three to six year sentence  Is an injustice  And a blow  To private property rights  Well because I think  He was defending himself  On his own property  From what threat  Yeah yeah  Where's the threat 
[02:01:30]  The story's almost over  Unless he was doing  Something that  I don't know  You need a threat  Of bodily harm  To you  Or actually  In some cases  Deadly bodily harm  A threat  Where you believe  Your life  Is being threatened  Before you can  Pull your gun out  He was annoyed  He was on his own property  Like isn't he allowed  To carry on his own property  He probably has  It's probably a brandishing crime  A crime with a gun  Is probably the mandatory sentence  I don't think it's the fact  That he had the gun 
[02:02:00]  I think it's the fact  That he brandished it  And  But is it still brandishing  When you're on your own  Like  Yeah  On the land that you own  Say somebody knocks on your door  And wants to  A Jehovah's Witness  And you just pull a pistol  And wave it at them  You're on your own property  Now here's something  I have experience with  I get it  Because I would do that  But I mean I'm not saying  You point a gun at a Jehovah's Witness  But let's say you come  And you answer the door  And your gun is holstered  But it's in plain sight  That's fine  If you're in your house 
[02:02:30]  Yeah that's fine  Let's see how the sentence  Any one of us  Would do the same thing  In the same situation  At sentencing  The judge said  He was required by law  To impose the three to six years  In prison  But he also said  A sentence including  Work release  And home confinement  Would have been more appropriate  We were told by the  Department of Corrections  That they won't consider that  Until at least two years  Have been served  That's a fucked up story  Yeah  That's silly  He seems like an asshole  With all the no trespassing  He shouldn't have gotten that 
[02:03:00]  Yeah but I mean  Mandatory  He shouldn't have gotten that  That's ridiculous  Of course not  But he was being kind of stupid  You know  Who is the lady  Can we see a picture of her  Yeah  Is she a big dyke  That's probably  That probably comes into play  Let's see the lady  Let's see if  Let's see if  I would have pulled  A gun out or not  Yeah  See how big her tits are  Yeah  The  That guy was  A little rambunctious 
[02:03:30]  I think  Let me go to  Scott in D.C.  Scott  Yo  One and a half  Anthony  I was pretty surprised  That he's calling this guy  Dick  When he walks around  With a .50 caliber  Strapped to his hip  While he's having a beer  At night  And trains a  A rifle on a rodent  Trains a rifle on a rodent  When you had the  Oh the  The raccoon  In the cage  That was  Oh yeah  That was a little joke picture  That was fun  He did for everybody  You think I  You think I had that thing loaded  What are you  What are you crazy  Oh come on 
[02:04:00]  What kind of man are you  A great one  Thank you  Thank you  Watch it out guys  Alright  That was wonderful  That was a great call  Great  Alright  So  There you have it  That's a weird little story  Mandatory sentences  Are a little weird  Should it be a  Case by case basis  I'm not into the  Mandatory sentence  Yeah I'm not into  The mandatory sentence  I'm into  Putting people away  For doing bad shit  But you should look at 
[02:04:30]  Each case individually  And go like  Alright  I think  I think  How did that get put in place  How did mandatory sentences  Get fucking  How does that pass  Because  Do people think  Oh it's going to be racist  Because more of these people  Are going to go to prison  Than this person  In a way I'm against it  In a way I'm for  Because it does stop  Plea bargaining  Like  Like  Plea bargaining  Lawyers are such  Fucking worms  They plea their clients out  You're right  It does have a certain 
[02:05:00]  Element of fairness to it  But it does  At times  Seem irrational  Yeah  Because at times  The judge has no say  In the matter  And it's obvious  The person shouldn't get  As much time  As they're getting  Like this case  Yeah this case  Even the guy  Guy's an idiot  I mean  That's a long  Fucking time  To go away  Yeah  For waving a gun  Around on your property  You guys want  The best story of the day  Um  No  I want the  Third best story  Of the day  Well then that would be  Jim Leritz  Well really  He was on our show 
[02:05:30]  Remember  Yes I do  How do you say  He's drunk  Drunk  How is he acquitted  Of the manslaughter  I think the woman  Had been drinking too  Yeah that's what he said  And I think  I mean  Defenses  I think  Yeah  Sometimes the person  Of DUI manslaughter  Yeah sometimes  The drunk person  It wasn't their fault  Like if you're driving  And you're uh  Drunk  And somebody fucking  Blows through a light  And T-bones you  And they end up dying  It's like  Is that what happened  In this case  I don't know 
[02:06:00]  I don't know  I don't think  That's what happened  I think he fucking  Slammed into her  Trap dog  Yeah they also  Said that  There's conflicting  Reports of whether  Or not he  Ran a red light  A lot of people  Said that he  Had the green light  And she had the red light  And people said  That her headlights  Weren't even on  Oh shit  Aw shit  They only deliberated  For like 45 minutes  That's it  Yeah  This went on for years  Though this case  Man he's lucky  He's a lucky guy  That's a  Did he get  Did he get convicted  Of drunk driving  No he must  Yeah and 
[02:06:30]  You know  He'll serve whatever  But his lawyer  Is trying to get  Time served already  Because  Yeah because  Well if she was  Drunk and plowed  Through  A red light  With no headlights  You can't  Convict him  Of vehicular man  So I mean  You know  And he was  Very very  Just above the limit  Was he  Yeah  Okay  I'm happy for him  Pussy  Yeah  Jesus  Well this is  The best story  Of the day  And maybe  Maybe Travis  Could get me  Some music 
[02:07:00]  For this next story  Oh  Oof  Do you know  What I'm talking  About  Sort of  Oh Jimmy  Did you  Sorry  Oof  Is it sewage  Horrendous  I think Travis  Knows what I'm  Talking about  Right below  Lyrics  Or Lyrics  Okay hang on  Yeah I got it  Oh  This is the best  Travis  Travis concurs  There's a lot of  Shit going on today  But this is  This is a doozy  Oh  You know who this is  I do  It sounds like  8,000 people  Hold on  Yeah  Oh yeah 
[02:07:30]  Yeah  This is  Joan Baez  Joan Baez  Joan Baez  Is in the news today  Oh that's nice  What happened  She was hurt  What  She was hurt  She was injured  She was injured  Over the weekend  What happened  Well  Joan Baez  Hurt after falling  Oh  From tree house  What  She built  Dumb hippie  Would she knock it off  So she could sleep 
[02:08:00]  Among real birds  She is an idiot  Joan Baez  Is an idiot  She fell from her tree house  From her tree house  Because she wanted to sleep  With the real birds  How about you leave nature alone  Yeah  What are you doing  You don't belong in a tree  You're blithering idiots  I am so glad  She fell out of a tree house  What an asshole  They just say hurt  What does that mean  Her feelings were hurt  What  Yeah  How hurt was she  Yes  He hurt my feelings 
[02:08:30]  How would have the birds  Helped her when she fell  Yeah  They just mocked her  Yeah  They just shit on her  And fly down and grab her  So she didn't hit the ground  And made sure her bird duty  They're  Ah fuck  Oh boy  What is  What is wrong with her  You tripped on that one  A little bit  It's 2010  You dummy  It's not 1968  You hippie  Is there more to the story  That's all I got on that I think  Hold on  Maybe I got more here  There's a picture of her  Up in a tree  With her guitar 
[02:09:00]  Yeah  Singing to the birds  I think it would be kind of cool  To build a tree house  Now that we know what we're doing  And now that Richard's dead  Yeah  Now that he's not  A problem anymore  Oh god  Look at her bare foot  Up in her tree  With a fucking guitar  She fell 20 feet to the ground  Oh god  That must have been great  She probably rolled over  And she didn't have walls  On the tree house  Because she wanted to sleep  Among real birds  So she probably rolled over 
[02:09:30]  In her sleep  Rolled over in her sleep  Holy shit  Just fucking  No walls  That's good  That's rational  Great  She's just about 70  Virgil  Kane is my name  And  What are you doing  Minor injuries  Released already  Oh  She was actually climbing down  From the platform  When she fell  What the fuck  Are you doing  Joan  Why do you have to sleep  With birds  Leave them alone  You're not helping them  By sleeping with them

[02:30:30]  I want to know  What happened  Because we talked about it  Friday  You should have went  And then you would have  I had a gig  I had a gig  I was playing bar nine  And of course  Bar nine  Bar nine  Of course the news  Both Fox and CNN  Are obsessed  The website  That has been  The big store  Every channel has it  It's urging people  It's urging travelers  To boycott  Going through the x-ray  The back scatter  That's big news  As it's called 
[02:31:00]  On Wednesday  The day before  Thanksgiving  So you're just  Fucking yourself  You're just  Fucking yourself  You dumbies  They're going to shut down  Airports now  So this campaign  What they're doing  If people follow it  Could add to the already  Long delays  On the underwire  That's a concern  Now earlier on  Good day  We had Gigi Bowman  Who's part of this  Opt out day  Campaign  Talking about  What they plan to do  And she was pretty  Explicit  The whole goal  Goal is to 
[02:31:30]  Definitely slow things down  We're handing out flyers  To people entering  The airport  You fat monster  Just to give them a little  Education on what to expect  Some people  Have no idea  That what they're about to deal with  Is either  Unconstitutional  200 pounds  Or that  It will  Affect them  And their dignity  Yourself  If you're traveling  Expect them  A TSA chief  Pistole  Said that her campaign  Is quote unquote  Irresponsible  Meanwhile  Others are trying to  Cash in on the 
[02:32:00]  Controversy  Like this guy  In Las Vegas  Who has specially  Designed underwear  For men and women  With well  You can see right there  Picture  To protect their  Penises and vaginas  Private parts  That he says  Will allow them  To get through  The x-ray machine  Without  Their private  With their privacy  Intagued  That's what it is  Baby Americans  Really an advanced culture  Fucking babies  We've been talking  To passengers  All morning here  At Kennedy airport  About the privacy issues  About their concerns 
[02:32:30]  And here's what  Two had to say  Here's what  Two had to say  I think that there  Should be other ways  To really x-ray  Who wants to see  Your pussy  A monster  It doesn't have to be  This x-ray  I mean they check  The whole body  And this is  To me this is wrong  I think too  That it is a little bit  Intrusive  But  I think it's  What do we got here  This is for security  I don't mind  To do that  TSA sees her  Walk up and just like  Yeah  She's getting padded  Every single time  And actually a recent poll  Shows that  Most Americans  Who are surveyed 
[02:33:00]  About the new procedures  Don't have a problem  With that  So the debate continues  Most Americans  Being surveyed  Didn't have a problem  With it  Then why the fuck  Are you talking about it  Asshole  Have you seen this video  A lot of folks  Are talking about  Fuck this kid  An 8 year old  Being screened  Almost being strip searched  See that  Good  Fuck him  Supposedly  You know  Because the kid  Was getting padded down  So much  His father said  Just take off his shirt  He took off the shirt  And then the TSA  Were like  Please put  Put your son's shirt  Back on  But they're showing  The video  Like the TSA 
[02:33:30]  Took it off  Very frustrated  With the procedure  Mark my words  What  This will not be in effect  From 6 months from now  It may not be in effect  By Christmas  Don  Oh shut up  They are open to  Allowing this to evolve  And they want to make it  Less intrusive  One plane explodes  Everyone's going to go  What happened  Where was the security  Why was he allowed  On the plane  Look at this report  From the BBC  If we can roll  That video  Oh fuck the BBC too  Young people  In madrasas  In Pakistan

[02:36:00]  Any of you  Privacy advocates  I value my privacy  As much as you do  I value my privacy  As much  As you do  But I don't think  That privacy is the issue  In a public place  When people are getting  Onto an airport  Where I know  That these savage  Motherfuckers  Would gladly  Bring down a plane  With me on it  They must be  Loving  This shit  They got to watch  CNN and Fox  And just go like  Oh do we have them  Running around in circles  They're trying to do it

[02:37:00]  Right there  Then you're forced  To just leave the airport  Then you're forced  To leave the fucking airport  Trapped door  Right there  I love that  Trapped door right there  People try to conduct business  Just get on a plane  These fucking assholes  Are making a statement  The day before Thanksgiving  Thanks  Fuck you  It's not a good time for that  I would never say  I hope a bomb goes off  Because I really don't  No  But I hope  That somebody gets through  With a weapon  And they are caught somehow  Before things go wrong  Just in time 
[02:37:30]  And it's a complete fluke  That they got caught  Yeah  Because that'll prove  Like look idiots  This is necessary  In this world  These same dummies  That were saying  You can't profile  Who the fuck  Do you think  Left that car  In Times Square  Well according to  Our retarded mayor  It could be somebody  Against health care  With food  Of course it was  You dumb motherfuckers  Dummies  Just will never say it  You dummies  Alright listen  Fucking annoying  We're gonna take a break  And when we get back

[02:39:30]  Open sunny mornings, Ron and Fez  On the virus, Sirius XM.  I know you want what's on my mind. 
[02:40:00]  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know the beach is from this side.  I know you know, you know, you know.  You think Sarah Palin's hot?  She's looking hotter or something, man.  Yeah.  You watching that show on TLC?  No.  No.  Her reality show thing?  Her fake reality show.  Is it fake?  They're all fake.  Well, they are all fake. 
[02:40:30]  Would you do Sarah Palin?  Are we allowed to talk about that?  Yeah, of course.  We are.  Would you do Sarah Palin?  Yes.  Yes.  She's sexy.  In a second.  No, wait.  She's a pretty woman.  Yeah, she's a little motherly.  What are you, a peter pumper?  Too motherly.  What's wrong with that?  I don't like motherly women.  Why?  You get to suckle in their bosoms.  No, I don't like that whole thing.  I don't like motherly.  You don't like motherly brides? 
[02:41:00]  No, no.  Now you get over here and you start fucking me.  Stop.  No, I'm not into the motherly look and personality.  We can move on.  This Tom Cruise picture is horrifying.  I don't care if he was strapped down.  I don't give a shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look where Tom Cruise was hanging out over the weekend.  Where is he sitting?  As he's filming his latest Mission Impossible movie.  That's the top of the Burge Tower. 
[02:41:30]  Yes.  Wow.  The video we saw was...  Holy shit.  Oh, you didn't see this then, Ant?  No, no.  I saw the video.  You saw the video where he was a lot lower.  Yeah.  Now he's sitting on the top.  The tippy top.  That is the ultimate top of the building's life.  Have you seen the video, how high that is, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  The Burge, it's horrifying.  What is he doing?  The wind up there is bad, too.  Oh, my God.  It's got to be crazy.  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  And they explain what it took to get him up there.  What did it take?  A whole bunch of shit, obviously.  Where does it explain that?  I'm very curious about that.  Wow.  That's scary.  Like 433 steep stairs.  Oh, God.  That's so high up there.  The tower wobbles dreadfully.  There's a guy up there, and it's the wind.  Listen to the wind.  In fact, there's a bloody pinnacle shakes.  That's like an airplane high.  Would you sit in that?  Dude, if you fall, there's nothing. 
[02:42:30]  Do they have nets set up or anything, or no?  No.  They're not supposed to be up there.  Only a few people get to go up there.  Like, this guy obviously works there and has to do something way the fuck up there.  Dude, why would you do that?  That's horrifying.  Just to look at this video.  These window cleaners could fucking go jump in the lake.  That is retarded.  And he was sitting on the edge, right?  He was just kind of sitting up there.  My hands are sweating.  You can look down at giant buildings, and they look like nothing.  Sure.  They're not even close to where this is.  Oh, dude, this is so high in the air. 
[02:43:00]  This video is so scary.  Are you scared, Jimmy?  Yes.  I'm backing up away from the video.  Jimmy doesn't want to be close to the video.  Dude, why would he look over the edge?  What if the wind gets you?  It's freaking me out just seeing the video.  Dude, I would be so scared to blow out of the fucking...  To blow out of there.  That's where the building starts, way down there.  This is just the fucking...  The radio tower.  That thing has to sway back and forth so much.  Get the fuck out of here.  In the wind.  And I'm sure...  Jimmy is just freaking out.  Dude, I back away from it.  Oh, nerds.  Do you have to walk on the outside to get up there? 
[02:43:30]  I don't know.  You have to, right?  No, I think it's probably internal so you don't get blown up.  Ooh, it's fucking awful, dude.  It's awful.  It's fucking horrendous.  So Tom Cruise was sitting on the top of that.  How did he get up to the top?  But his legs are hanging over the edge.  Yeah, his legs are hanging over the edge.  How did they do it?  I guarantee you they hoisted him onto it.  They said, I forgot where I saw the article, but they said that he had to climb up there.  Take the elevators and then stairs and then like a ladder thing or whatever.  But from the top, I guarantee you he was bolted in before they sat him down. 
[02:44:00]  They didn't just hold him up there.  Oh, yeah.  Bolted him in.  Of course.  I don't care if you bolted in.  You'd still be out of your mind.  The wind is blowing you.  I know.  That's just got to be scary.  I'll be like, the wind's blowing me, sir.  Yeah, I'm very frightened.  They probably have you on fucking, on like steel cable strength things holding your waist  down so you can't blow off.  It's probably an impossibility for you to blow off.  I think the picture was in yesterday's paper.  Because they show the whole building so you get the perspective of where the fuck he is. 
[02:44:30]  Dude, I bet the camera work up there must be great.  I really want to see this movie now.  What a smart...  Yeah, right.  He's just being a nut.  But you could just CGI that shit.  Why wouldn't you?  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  He loves doing shit.  I would CGI myself.  He's just an alpha male.  He was right.  He was.  He's such a fucking type A personality guy.  Oh, wow.  He's going a long way for people to not think he's gay.  Dude, why are you sitting on the biggest cock on the planet? 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  I'm just saying.  Wow.  Who the fuck knows what he does, man?  That is something.  Dude, he's fucking crazy, man.  Did you see the kid walking off on the ledge of that other video?  I think it was on Break.com and then Joe Rogan tweeted it.  Horrified.  Can I see it?  There are teenagers walking out on this little metal girder or whatever.  I hate girders.  Yeah.  You don't like the girder?  No, because they held the woman's stomach in.  No, it's a girdle chip.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:45:30]  He tweeted a few days ago, so I don't know how we get there today.  Rogan tweets a lot.  Yeah, but that video is fine.  If anyone knows where that video is, I would appreciate it.  Why would you sit up there?  These guys walked out.  You've got to see this kid walking out about eight feet on this girder.  And it is a drop.  Hundreds of feet.  And they're just laughing.  They're just like kids partying.  I'm going to watch.  I'm going to just walk out on the edge of this thing.  I'm telling you, it'll make Jimmy almost leave the studio if he sees this.  You think that video we just saw with the guy safely in like the, you know, the... 
[02:46:00]  Yes, it's very uncomfortable.  What do you call it?  Wait till you see this kid just walking out on this thing.  How do you not like Tom Cruise?  He's fucking nuts.  He does his own stunts.  I would never do my own stunts.  Unless it was we need a place to put this girl's ass.  I'd be like, I'll use my face.  I'll do it myself.  You don't need a stunt nose for her to tinkle on.  Tinkle on.  Let's see.  How high up was he?  That's 238 feet. 
[02:46:30]  Well, it's not as bad as I thought.  Dude, I can't comprehend his life.  No, no, no.  Like, what's that like to sit up there?  He was probably happy to just be alone.  It's like, ah, no one's asking me for anything up here.  This is great.  What are you thinking while you're sitting up there?  What do you think he does in the movie?  Do you think he jumps and like throws out a parachute?  Dude, hopefully that's probably the end of the movie where he's just sitting there thinking.  But he's...  It can't be the middle. 
[02:47:00]  It's either the beginning or the end.  You think?  Yeah.  He's strapped in.  It's so high.  It could be the beginning to really just get you going.  If you accept this mission.  Right.  Or he's on a radio transmission.  Yeah.  Because it's a radio tower.  But he's got to do something where he jumps.  Here it is.  Maybe he's trying to get a C-100 in New York.  Thank you, Danny.  Watch this.  Well, that's high up.  So they're above a whole bunch of trees that are way the fuck below in the teenage hot broad there.  She scoots out on the thing. 
[02:47:30]  You can tell she's all freaked out.  Watch this guy.  He's just standing on the outside.  Look at the cars way the fuck below.  I'll tweet this later for everybody.  Why are they doing this?  I don't know, but it's going to make your hands sweat, Jimmy.  Watch what this kid does.  He can't be more than 18, 19 years old.  They're all laughing.  Just to make his friends think he's cool.  And he almost fucking slipped.  Oh, man.  His first step, he almost slipped and he had something to hold on to.  He would fall so fucking... 
[02:48:00]  Then he scoots out like the girl did.  Look at this.  Is that horrifying?  Is that fucking horrifying?  Oh, man.  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy is in shock.  I would never do that.  No.  Why would you?  Who the fuck would?  Is that horrifying, Jimmy?  And that's it.  That's how the video ends.  He stands up and just does the hands on hip.  I'm pissing into a urinal with no hands.  How wide is the beam, you think? 
[02:48:30]  It's not even a foot.  It's probably...  I would guess 8 to 10 inches, maybe.  8 inches.  It's like an 8-inch girder.  And he just fucking stands up perfectly still and just looks out.  What a dummy.  I guess it wasn't windy that day.  What's the upside in that?  Would you do that to me?  Do your friends go, wow, remember that time you did that?  But if we had a fake girder on the floor right now, you'd walk out on the end of it every time perfectly.  It's not even a question.  You wouldn't be all woozy or anything. 
[02:49:00]  You'd just go, yeah, here we go.  I would actually nickname myself the girder kid.  Oh, you saw the...  Thank you, Pete, in Redding.  You guys saw the 800-foot tower climb, right?  That was going around for a while?  Well, that was extremely high.  You saw that?  Yes.  That made me nauseous.  One of the guys had a camera on his helmet there and showed what it takes to get to the top of the radio tower.  It was an 1800-foot building.  Or 1800-foot tower.  It's not on a building.  I thought it was higher than that. 
[02:49:30]  1800 feet is pretty...  Oh, boy, is it high.  That's pretty fucking...  Yeah.  Pretty fucking high.  That's pretty high up.  I think it's 1800 or maybe...  I don't know, whatever.  It's fine.  Yeah, heights...  Bother you?  No, heights don't bother me if I'm inside something.  The second I'm outside of something, then they start bothering me.  Like, I could go to any observation deck and shit like that and look around, no problem.  But if I have to climb on the outside of something...  Oh, fuck that. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, that would be a bit much.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck that.  Yeah, the transmission tower.  What are they, walking up this thing?  You haven't seen this?  Yeah, it's really high, dude.  They're climbing this ladder.  They have to repair something on the top.  I mean, it's...  Oh, the light.  The light on top that warrants planes.  The light bulb or whatever needs to be changed.  Jesus.  Why don't they figure some way that we don't have to climb?  Dude, it's fucking horrific.  Horrific.  These two guys climbing up. 
[02:50:30]  All right.  You really need animation for an amazing video.  Getting to work can be a chore, especially if your workplace is 1,700 feet straight up.  1,700 feet.  That's the commute for people that work on transmission lines and antennas in the world of broadcasting.  Wow.  Harder than the Empire State.  This bigger than the Mr. Tower.  This is what it's like to climb to the top of a 1,768-foot tower just to begin your workday.  Oh, God. 
[02:51:00]  There's an elevator that goes up like 1,600?  No.  No, not even.  Maybe like 12 or 13.  It all starts with an elevator ride to about 1,600 feet.  Oh, you're right.  Sorry.  After that, it's all about climbing.  What?  Do you want to feed that to climb?  Oh, that's stupid.  Oh, my God.  That's so high up.  They're in an enclosed...  They're enclosed for now.  Yeah.  Of course, you have to bring all your tools with you.  Do you?  That's the red bag hanging below.  Now he's not enclosed, is he?  He weighs about 30 pounds, and you pull it up behind you all the way to the top. 
[02:51:30]  This guy's Mr. Personality, isn't he?  But is he closed in or no?  He can fall.  Yeah, he can.  I'll wait until he has to get on the outside.  Where you have to remember to bring everything you're going to need.  Wait, wait, wait.  How is he walking?  Now he's on the outside.  He's got to pull himself out.  But how...  Once you reach the top of the tower itself, it's time to go outside.  Where's the safety line?  How do you get down?  Jimmy's so scared watching me.  I love watching these videos with Jimmy.  Dude, how do you get down? 
[02:52:00]  You've got to climb.  That the antenna's mounted on top of it.  It's just there for extra height.  Why would you do this?  He's climbing on these little...  Little pegs?  This is called free climbing.  Yes, it is.  Meaning that no safety lines are used.  Oh, my God.  There's no safety lines.  It's easier, faster, and most tower workers climb this way.  Oh, wow.  It's good to take a break and look around while you rest.  They put a safety line on there that's so high in the air. 
[02:52:30]  Free climbing is more dangerous.  Yes, it is.  Of course.  But OSHA rules do allow for it.  Does OSHA allow that?  Attaching, climbing, attaching, and removing safety lines.  That's in his insurance bill.  Very few feet.  Slows progress and is tiring.  Now he's climbing on the outside.  Here you can see an electrical junction box for the tower lights.  Now he's just climbing like King Kong on the outside of him.  How do you climb down?  Where do you put your feet?  Inside the cage, you can now see the transmission line.  He's not done climbing, though.  He has to get to the top of this thing. 
[02:53:00]  This part of it.  That doesn't even have shit you're supposed to climb on.  No.  No.  Now he's just climbing on cross members and cutouts.  And he's outside the tower now.  He is so high up.  1,700 feet.  Almost 1,800 feet.  But there's no ladder there.  No.  There should be a ladder with a back on it.  The antenna tuner.  He's hanging.  It's shaped like this to allow for the expansion and contraction of the transmission line.  I would be mad at my fucking mind.  On that 1,700 foot run to the top.  Getting down.  Your feet are all fumbling for a place. 
[02:53:30]  Now he hooks on.  Asshole.  Your feet are all fumbling.  Yeah.  Where do I put my feet?  We've all been in that position.  They would have to come up and get me.  Yeah.  There's no way.  Spiky flowers on their long stems are used to attract electrical charges in the air.  He's still climbing, by the way.  This helps to dissipate the charges.  He's still not where he's got to be.  Look.  Now there's really nothing to climb on.  Now it's like.  It's like.  He's climbing over the.  If he slips, he's a deep shit. 
[02:54:00]  And even if he's got that thing latched on, it's going to.  It will swoop over the edge and he'll fall.  Oh, he's done.  He's done.  He's done.  The base of the antenna.  From here, it's just another 60 feet to the top.  60 feet of one.  He's still not to the top.  Six stories.  He still has to climb.  But look at how.  Does he got to shimmy up the pole now?  Dude, look at how.  He's looking for a place to put his hands.  I'm sorry.  Dude, you're really climbing.  His climbing partner is now holding the tool bag to keep it from swinging and knocking 
[02:54:30]  him off balance.  Oh, do you think?  What is he climbing on?  Why don't they build nice ladders?  Look what he's climbing.  This little pole that's attached to the big fucking.  This is so stupid.  This is the dumbest job.  Dude, this is fucking horrible.  I've never seen this.  This is the dumbest job ever.  They would have to come up and coax me down.  They'd have to put a giant net.  Now, the antenna is much thinner than the guy's body at this point that he's climbing. 
[02:55:00]  Could you imagine?  This is nothing now.  He has nothing that he's climbing.  It's a little pole.  A tiny, tiny little pole.  A little fence pole.  I bet it's windy.  Oh, God.  It's got to be crazy.  He's close to 1,800 feet in the air.  The whole thing is shaking, too.  I would never do that.  No.  Look how it's getting smaller.  It's a tiny little pole.  What does he have to do up there?  Fix the light, dude.  Stop it.  They should make the light come down. 
[02:55:30]  How?  I don't know.  Put it on a crank.  Yeah.  Time for another break.  Watch it.  Jimmy just got me.  He checks on the lightning conditions.  Give me hiccups.  If a storm's blowing through, there's no quick way down.  Yeah, I know.  Jimmy's all scared.  He's got his hand on his chest.  He's like, I know.  This is hard.  This is horrifying.  I want to see him climb down, but they don't show that.  He's obviously way on the outside.  He's still climbing.  It's a tiny little, very long fence pole, basically.  I would not do this for a lot of money. 
[02:56:00]  For anything.  There's nothing around him.  He's above the clouds.  Oh, yeah.  And the...  Dude, I wouldn't go in an elevator this high.  I know.  No.  This is so scary.  In a glass box.  Is he up there?  The top is in sight.  And time for another break.  See, by the way, that clip-on thing is the dumbest clip-on thing.  Because if he fell, it would just...  It could slide right off the peg.  The momentum would slide off the peg.  You can see 55 miles to the horizon.  No one cares.  Dude, look at my hands.  I'm putting fucking prints on the fucking... 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy's hands are so sweaty.  What has he got?  Did he forget the light bulb down there?  Eventually he forgot it.  Yeah, he has to shit.  Look, look at the view.  It's a nice view.  Look at that view.  It's not a nice view.  Look at the nice view, Jimmy.  That's...  And he's bringing up the...  Remember the dumb spiky things?  That's so far below him.  I would hate to be getting a piggyback ride from him.  Dude, he does a headstand on the top of this thing.  Without anything.  I would hate to get a piggyback ride that high.  This is the tricky part.  Yeah, really?  On top.  Look, he's now shimmying up the pole. 
[02:57:00]  There's nothing to hold on to.  How is he going to get down?  That object with the black top is the lighting beacon.  How does he get down, Jimmy?  How does he get down?  Look at how tiny it is at the top.  He's just standing on nothing.  It's so horrible.  It's so tiny.  He's holding on to a little fucking stick.  I would never do this.  1,800 feet off the ground.  Oh, I would quit.  I would quit.  Like they would hire you in the first place. 
[02:57:30]  Jimmy would be in the elevator going, no.  You would make believe you'd change the light bulb until they finally...  And that's how you climb to the top of a transmission tower.  Oh, now they screw in the safety devices.  That doesn't look strong enough to hold them, though.  It doesn't.  No.  Isn't that horrifying?  You haven't seen that yet?  I've seen it, yes.  It bothered me the first time.  That's crazy.  All I know is I want to see them climbing down.  Why would they turn the camera off?  And how do you...  Where do you like...  Where's my foot go?  Hey, Hal, Ned.  Hal, Ned. 
[02:58:00]  And how do you make a...  Are you a co-worker?  How do you make a video like that so boring?  The guy made that a boring video.  And as he climbs up, he doesn't have much to hold on to.  Time to rest.  He clips on his...  Oh, Phil in Rochester.  We'd love to see Jimmy in an IMAX of this.  Oh, that would be fun.  They should make that into an IMAX video.  Dude.  Yeah.  That's just...  Or how about...  I think it would be funny to put Jimmy on Soarin' in that ride at Disney.  Where it feels like you're flying. 
[02:58:30]  It just feels like you're flying.  That'd be fun.  You like that?  I would close my eyes.  It's pretty fucking cool, though.  The screen, everything moves like a simulator kind of thing.  But you're looking at this giant screen that's totally wrapped around you.  Does it make you sick or no?  You definitely feel every move.  Like, you're going over things and turning.  You feel the wind.  Like, they put all the effects on you and shit.  It's pretty cool.  Hey, this guy does it for a living.  Neil in New Hampshire. 
[02:59:00]  Neil.  Hey, man.  How's it going?  Good morning.  Hi, Neil.  You really do this for a living?  Yes.  We just got back from a three-month gig with AT&T, changing out all their tower lines.  What were you doing?  Removing the towers?  Hey, listen.  Just do whatever you can to muddle reception.  You're installing reception muddlers.  Giant gloves and mittens over the fucking receptors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My bad.  My bad. 
[02:59:30]  Wait.  You just replaced all the light bulbs on all the AT&T towers where?  We've been in Colorado, Idaho, California, and just finished up two weeks in Vegas.  How high up are those things?  Two feet.  They're in the basement.  We had to climb down into a well.  AT&T stinks.  The little towers.  The little teeny towers.  Little cell towers.  Yeah, the coolest thing was we took a big ball down, or a big beacon, and took it to 
[03:00:00]  the Hogs and Heifers there in Las Vegas and gave it to the bar, and they treated us like  rock stars.  They got it lit up in there.  It lights up the whole day.  All right.  We don't care about that.  Wait, sir.  How high are the towers?  The tallest one we did was 850.  That's big.  850 feet, yeah.  Anything over 20 feet is horrifying.  Yeah, anything over 20 feet, you're fucking, unless you're Joan Baez in a tree fort.  Dude, why don't they build these ladders better?  Why are they all, like, outside climbing shit that shouldn't be climbed on? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, you climbing outside like that video?  Yeah, yeah.  That's just the reason.  They don't want people that don't know what they're doing up there.  Oh, because if they had ladders, you know, the kids would get up there.  So, are you scared of heights at all?  No.  And just figured a way around it?  No.  So, that doesn't bother you at all?  You respect it.  You're not, you can't be scared of it, but you respect it.  I've had, I've had a football.  You have to be scared.  You have to be.  As a human being, you have to be scared.  Then again, it's like hanging 800, 900, in this case, with this other video, 1,800 feet  outside a fucking tower like that.  You have to be scared somehow. 
[03:01:00]  You're, uh, I want you to make sure you're, uh, you're well protected.  If you just do what you're supposed to do, the safety devices are there, and you'll be  okay.  But the thing is, like, how do you get down?  Like, what if you're fumbling with something and it falls?  Fumbling.  It falls really quick.  Oh, that's funny.  Do you have a parachute on?  A parachute.  If I fell, I would just pull the old shoot-a-roo.  I love Jimmy's little questions.  You got a parachute?  It's like we're in third grade.  I love it.  You got a plane, mister? 
[03:01:30]  Right.  What does a fireman do for a living?  How about getting a helicopter just to fucking fix that light?  Yeah.  I was going to call and invite Jimmy up to conquer his fears.  We'll go over on the, uh, Alpine Tower.  How big is that?  On the river there.  Is it taller than eight feet?  I decline.  Eight feet.  440 feet.  It ain't that bad, Jimmy.  It's got stairs all the way to the top.  Stairs?  Yeah.  Inside or outside?  Inside.  Oh, all right.  I can do steps.  You know what?  You say that now, but I bet you're in that. 
[03:02:00]  You'd still be freaked out.  Dude, I'm the fucking, they call me, uh, Jimmy Steps.  That was my nickname in high school.  Jimmy Steps.  Yeah.  I would go up and down steps like nobody's beeswax.  You ever see the one with the helicopter where they drop the guy off on the power lines?  Oh, yeah.  Try to find that fucking thing.  That's just frightening.  But it's where he has to, like, uh.  Yeah, get that little stick thing.  A rod to connect him.  Yeah, he's got it.  Oh, we've seen that one before, right?  Yeah, he pulls out his rod.  So they don't electrocute themselves?  I'd put that guy on hold because I'd go to this guy.  Why'd they just turn it off?  Matt in Connecticut.  Matt.  Hey, uh, if you take a look at that video, he's hanging that red bag down there.  I think he has to hold his giant fucking balls. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  There's big balls in that bag.  No, no, no.  It's, uh, tools.  Good, very good line, brother.  Yeah, this guy's got to go from a helicopter to a power line.  Dave in Chicago.  And there's electricity all over the town.  No, it's all over the town.  What are you doing?  Turn the fuck, unplug it, you douchebag.  Yeah, why do you have to have electricity going through the fucking thing?  He has to get, um, grounded.  Charged, yeah.  He's got to get that charge out of there.  And then, and then he puts this little sliding thing on the power cable and jumps right on. 
[03:03:00]  Off the helicopter, like, yeah, okay.  All right, I'm good.  I'm good now.  I'm just going to get on this power line now.  If he was, uh, if he didn't connect with the rod first or whatever, he would get electrocuted, right?  Yeah, he'd get zapped.  But why, why, why aren't they off?  Huh?  Because they can't shut it off.  It's powering a fucking city somewhere.  Sure.  Dave in Chicago, Dave.  Oh, my God.  What a dumb job.  What a dumb job.  And now he's just sitting on the wire and the helicopter goes away. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  And he has the rod to touch the helicopter again.  What if you drop that?  Your fucking goose is cooked.  Yeah, because you don't want it arcing between you, your body, and the helicopter.  And there he goes.  There goes his safety.  That's his rod.  And now he's just like a squirrel on a fucking power line.  He's just kind of walking on it.  What is he doing up there?  Why does he have a protective outfit on?  What's that going to do?  Look at the guy going the other way.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Sam.  Hi, Bill.  It's slow down that way.  It's their traffic backed up. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, it's their computer work.  Free fried friends.  Right.  What is he doing, though?  I don't know.  Where is he going?  I don't know.  Checking insulators and chips.  They're probably both just trying to get to the edge.  It's a fraternity prank.  Crawl on two billion volts.  And make sure you don't lose the marshmallow.  Two billion volts.  I would hate to be crawling on that.  Oh, who would?  Yeah, they're doing something with the insulators.  That's unbelievable.  Dave in Chicago.  Dave.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  How are you doing?  Good.  Better than these guys.  Wow.  Yeah, I hear that.  Hey, I'm a local one iron worker out of Chicago, and I wanted you guys to check out something 
[03:04:30]  on YouTube.  It's called Completely Crazy Tower Crane Climb.  This kid's about 1,600 feet off the ground, and he's doing pull-ups on the boom of the  tower.  I've seen that.  Oh, can I see that?  Please.  I've seen that.  I actually faked that.  Oh, that was you doing it?  Yeah, I've done pull-ups, but I was only above my bedroom floor.  Completely Crazy Tower Climb.  All right.  We'll check that out.  Dude, these make me so nervous. 
[03:05:00]  Heights make me so nervous.  I know.  They really do.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The doobies are still playing?  I see that.  Did you see the guy from the doobies that is like the doobie guy?  The main doob?  With the long hair?  Looks like Robin Williams.  I remember seeing them on...  Jimmy, look at this kid.  He doesn't even work for this company.  He just decided to get up here.  Wow.  He's hanging from so high up in the air.  Why is he doing that?  If his fucking hands slipped...  If he does one too many pull-ups, he's fucked. 
[03:05:30]  Can you imagine?  Like, I tried to do a pull-up the other day.  I was like, uh-oh.  If all of a sudden your arms lock up...  Help me!  Help me!  He is crazy.  There's no reason to do this.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out of here!  His hands could slip so easily.  What if they're sweaty like mine are?  Yeah.  Look, he can barely do one.  He can barely do two.  He's going to need to do three to get the fuck back to safety. 
[03:06:00]  This is when Darwinism really needs to just take hold for people.  Look at him.  He can't get up, back up.  And he's going back up.  And how do you get back up to safety?  I don't know.  Why do you do this?  Stay home!  Get the fuck out of here.  That's crazy.  I've never seen this.  Huh?  Oh, that's what you do?  You get back on the wire?  Oh, this guy...  He only has a new Facebook photo.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, there you go.  Great.  These guys are ballsy dudes, man.  There's something going on in that head that just doesn't... 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, he's at the tippy top.  What, they have to ruin it with something?  What are they doing?  I don't know.  All right.  Everybody has their own little tag ghost in soccer.  Fucking foreigners in their soccer.  This has been a crazy guy hanging off of Tower Production.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's say hi to Tom in Boston.  Tom.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey there, Tam.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, Abin.  Yeah, have you guys seen the video on YouTube with the Seven Dying TV Tower Collapse? 
[03:07:00]  That'll be a good one for Jimmy to see it.  What's it called?  Seven Dying?  It's Seven Dying TV Tower Collapse.  Have you seen Louie on FX?  You want to watch that together?  What should we do?  That's right.  I want to see the tower collapse.  Yeah, the radio tower collapse is crazy.  I think they're hoisting guys up in like a portion of the tower and it just comes screaming down and they all die.  Oh my goodness.  How high up are they?  I really don't know.  Maybe even a thousand feet.  Is this it?  Let's see.  I've never seen this. 
[03:07:30]  All right.  There's a tower.  Let's let it go.  A piece of a tower.  I don't know what it is.  I guess they're erecting it.  Are they erecting a tower?  I don't know.  But look, there's a pointy end on the ground.  Shouldn't the pointy end be in the air?  Yeah.  They're going to lift it up, I think.  I think the pointy side shouldn't be that way.  Right.  I would hate to be killed in a tower collapse.  How do you get the tower all assembled?  Wow.  That is a big fucking piece of metal.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah, I guess they're going to lift it up and put it on something. 
[03:08:00]  I don't know what they're going to do.  There's a crane attached to this giant piece of tower.  But it looks like the tower is upside down, right?  It's like scaffolding.  Oh, no.  Maybe it goes into something.  Yeah.  All right.  What happens?  Something collapses, obviously.  It's not good.  As opposed to good?  They're just trying.  They're lifting this giant piece way up.  That's not good.  Oh, okay.  I'm fast-forwarding through the video, and I got to a point where the camera is just  upside down.  Completely upside down and still, so now I know I should park back up. 
[03:08:30]  And it's ready to...  Yeah.  Okay, let's see what happens.  Oh, my God.  Is there a volume on there?  I got the volume up.  Are there guys on that?  Yeah, there's guys riding it.  Why would they do that?  Because they've got to assemble it when they get it up there.  I like how angry Jimmy gets when...  I would never ride that fucking thing.  Oh, you got to get the tower.  What's it doing?  I don't know.  Is it hitting the other tower where it's not supposed to?  Something's going wrong.  And there it goes. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, man.  You see the guy just flying.  Oh, that's bad.  They ripped apart, and they all fell.  And then the camera's upside down.  Wow.  The guy did a sloppy job with the camera.  I know.  Pick the camera.  What did you expect?  His friends were plummeting.  Dude, go back a little bit.  There's one moment where the tower hits something, and the guys flop off it.  Yeah, they fly off of it.  Look at that guy.  What happens right before this?  Oh, man. 
[03:09:30]  It just falls apart.  What does it hit when it falls apart?  It hits a rope or something, right?  I don't know.  Something snapped.  I think it hit a guy wire.  Yeah?  It was a guy wire.  Wow.  What is that?  Sorry, I just wanted to hear what the doobie burn sound like these days.  Yeah.  Why didn't we get the doobies?  Exactly.  We want the doobies.  I'd rather take these guys who just fell off the tower.  I know, right?  Oh.  Oh.  What a lousy way to go. 
[03:10:00]  They knew they were so dead.  They knew they were so dead.  All right, finally.  They got probably fainted with the camera.  Why would the doobie brothers go on TV and play some horse shit new song?  Saw that.  Does this sound like anything you know?  No, it sounds like they're tuning. 
[03:10:30]  Is the rerun taping them?  I'm going to jail for a fat kid eating popcorn.  All right.  He's always a practice base around you.  I call it on your inner core life.  Yeah.  Still sounds like the doobie.  That's doobies.  All right.  Eastside Dave at E-Rock's wedding there.  Yeah.  That's what we're leading to.  E-Rock's wedding.  How was it, by the way? 
[03:11:00]  Hey, thank you, by the way, Kyle S. in Indiana.  People dying on YouTube, fine.  But Opie's videos get taken down.  Yeah.  You're allowed to die on YouTube.  Just can't make fun of a fat person.  Well, yeah.  I agree with that.  Ah, look who's here.  Sam Bo.  Sam Roberts was one of the privileged few that was invited to the E-Rock nuptials.  That's right.  Sam, you're like a pool reporter for us.  Yeah.  Because we weren't all invited.  No, no, no.  Many weren't. 
[03:11:30]  So, you know, when a reporter can go somewhere because of space limitations, logistics.  Sure.  Just being forgotten.  Yeah.  They get the pool reporter that goes to the event.  I see.  And covers it for us.  You are that person.  Oh, that's an honor.  So give us a little rundown of how this was not like a good wedding.  Were people forgotten or left off on purpose?  On purpose.  From here?  Completely on purpose.  I would say purpose.  I would think.  Completely on purpose. 
[03:12:00]  I would think.  Yeah.  But I would say inviting Eastside Dave, good idea.  Good idea.  Because it added some nice entertainment for the whole party to enjoy.  I would imagine.  So Eastside Dave was invited.  Oh, yes, he was.  Yes, he was.  He was absolutely invited.  Because I think E-Rock and Eastside Dave's wife go back a long way.  So he invited his wife.  And then he was the plus one in that situation.  Oh, oh, okay.  I would think.  All right, all right.  Any conversation on why some people from work were left out? 
[03:12:30]  No, it was a happy day for E-Rock.  Didn't want to bring him down.  I will say this.  I've never seen...  Seeing E-Rock at the wedding made me realize I've never seen E-Rock happy in this workplace before.  Was he happy?  He was happy at his wedding.  Because there was a giant cake.  Well, I don't know why.  It had to be the cake.  But he was happy, and he was in a good mood, and I had never seen that before in E-Rock.  Wow.  Sam sent me a text of E-Rock's fucking 1950s shoes. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  It looked like he was dropping his fucking date off at the sock hop.  There was some white in his shoes.  He did.  He had a splash of white in his shoes.  It almost looked like bowling shoes.  Yes.  Oh.  Yeah.  Continue.  There was one...  The wedding vows started on a very E-Rock note.  I wanted to just be like, what a beautiful ceremony it was.  Yeah.  But you know they do the thing where they go sentence by sentence, repeat the vows?  Right. 
[03:13:30]  He forgot one of them.  He had to repeat it.  Which one?  E-Rock.  I can't remember.  I promised a shared dessert.  He skipped over that one.  He doesn't want to.  Shortest wedding ceremony I've ever seen, though.  It was.  Very short.  Literally a minute.  Yeah.  Which was good.  They just got it done with, and then...  Had to wait an hour.  Yeah.  It was supposed to start at 7, started somewhere after 8.  No surprise.  E-Rock's late for everything.  Yes, that's true.  And the actual ceremony was one minute.  Did he have an excuse?  Was there traffic?  Yeah.  And I don't think it was a legal ceremony. 
[03:14:00]  No?  Really?  Because it was just so quick.  Because it was so quick.  They were really married?  Which doctor?  It was Big Kev's friend.  How could that be legal?  That's true.  Really?  How was the reception?  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah, the reception was nice.  I mean, the place was beautiful.  It was a very nice place, and they were...  The ceremony was in front of windows, looking out on the skyscape, and all the night lights  are all up.  Skyscape.  Wow, you make it sound fabulous.  It was a beautiful time.  Homosexual, you are.  But, uh...  It was a beautiful view, I've got to be honest with you, Manhattan. 
[03:14:30]  Great place for an apartment.  I would have to...  I've got to be honest.  I mean, you know, you see lower Manhattan all lit up at night.  It's kind of nice.  Yeah.  And go, oh, that's where the towers were.  Once cocktail hour.  And then you see the Statue of Liberty to your right.  Yes.  So now, who were the Lushes?  Well, Troy went in thinking he was going to be a Lush, but he also immediately started  complaining, because E-Rock had promised him there would be energy drinks at the bar.  Oh, shit.  And he was planning on having some Red Bulls and vodkas, because it was a Friday. 
[03:15:00]  A milkshake is an energy drink for E-Rock.  But so, Troy was not on the...  Troy's like a Four Loko type of guy.  Right.  Oh, really?  He was not on the A-game that we thought he might be.  No.  Eastside Dave absolutely was.  He came to play.  The best with Troy, like, no one wanted him at our table, so he got up for more sushi,  and we removed all his...  We removed his chair and his napkin.  For Troy?  Yeah.  We removed everything, so there was no sign he ever sat at our table by the time he got  back.  And we all squeezed in, so it looked like he didn't even have a spot to begin with. 
[03:15:30]  I think after he told E-Rock that he wasn't getting him a gift, that E-Rock got pissed  at Troy, because everybody who knew each other from the radio station was at table seven,  except Troy.  He was at table eight with nobody he knew.  Oh, wow.  That's kind of an insult.  He got put at a different table, but he insisted on sitting at ours, so we moved him.  I hate when weddings try to get people to know each other.  I'm not sitting with each other.  Stop.  I don't want to get to know anybody.  Or your family.  There was one moment when Opie convinced Eastside Dave to try some wasabi. 
[03:16:00]  Oh.  By itself.  Mm-hmm.  Just a chunk of it.  Bit's been done a million times.  Well, so be.  But it was a huge...  Fuss.  Shussie.  It was a huge chunk.  He lost his fucking mind.  And so Eastside Dave treated the entire room to the high-pitched shrills of Eastside Dave  in the middle of dinner.  Everybody's just crying.  I hear that video somewhere.  Was his wife mortified?  She was filming.  His wife gets a kick out of it, man.  She was mortified ever since he said, I do. 
[03:16:30]  That's it.  She was filming.  Those two.  Enchanting.  Enchanting.  And then there was...  Well, Jess caught the bouquet.  Oh, now what does that mean?  That means you're getting married, Sam.  Well, I mean, tradition says...  It means Jess is the next to get married.  Yes, and to you.  Don't say nothing about Sammy Cakes.  Exactly.  Why?  We'll see what it is.  What, you don't think she's going to marry you? 
[03:17:00]  Well, I'm sure she would.  But there's no immediate plans.  She's so far fucking above you.  You think so?  Yeah.  You're playing way out of your league with her.  You think I should try to lock this one down?  No.  I think it's June.  Just let her go.  Yeah.  Just let her get the guy that she deserves.  Because it's going to be a world of hurt when she meets him?  Yeah.  For you.  Right.  That's what I mean.  It's just going to end.  She doesn't want to go to Applebee's when you're celebrating your 10th anniversary.  Exactly right.  When somebody finally gives her an orgasm orally. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Imagine how awful Sam has to be in bed.  This is going to be terrible.  That's neither here nor there.  Yeah.  Neither here nor there.  Once she caught the bouquet.  Right.  I can't picture Sam slapping anybody into this cock.  No, no.  He'll probably just lay there like a victim while girls climb on.  Yeah.  Turn over on your biak.  Yeah.  Biak.  Turn over on your biak.  Yeah.  Look what I'm packing.  I'm going to put you in a figure four leg lock.  Sam's probably really like detailed sexually.  Like he has to.  He can only come if he's getting a femdom handjob. 
[03:18:00]  Femdom.  And that's it.  There's no other kinds of sex that Sam will have.  Can you please explain what that is?  I really don't know.  What's a femdom handjob?  Like a guy all tied up and stuff just getting beat off.  Okay.  Usually the chick is like laughing at his cock or something.  And she's like, come on.  Come on.  But just Sam like total silence.  Like fuck her.  Come on.  That's it.  Come on.  Yeah.  Where you at?  Where you at?  Where you at?  Come on.  Come on.  It's probably just quiet both of them moaning.  Oh.  Ooh.  Oh, you think that's it? 
[03:18:30]  A lot of ah and ooh.  Are you a dirty talker?  Not too much.  Is she?  Not too much.  No, not really.  What do you say that's dirty?  Come on.  One thing.  I don't even.  No, there isn't a lot of dirty talk.  There is a lot of quietness and silence.  She also gets nervous that the neighbor.  Because we can hear when the neighbor is singing next door.  Yeah.  Because he sings.  Give them a fucking show.  How will sex start with you two?  You or her normally initiated?  Well, usually Raw is on.  And so my dick's hard.  That's not going to interrupt Raw. 
[03:19:00]  Really?  No.  How does it usually start?  Well, it'll be either one of us, really.  And it'll usually be we're already in bed.  One of us hasn't fallen asleep yet.  She reach over and jiggle your balls.  She jiggles my balls.  And what will you do?  Reach over?  Start rubbing her shoulder?  Clumsy boy rub on her shoulder?  Oh, God.  Jiggles.  Just a ball.  Jiggles.  Just, hey.  Jingle, jangle, jingle. 
[03:19:30]  So what happens?  There's not a lot of romance, really.  It's like.  Oh, God.  Good.  There shouldn't be romance.  Because if we start kissing and don't stop after three kisses, that would usually mean,  all right, we're both awake enough.  You make out?  Before sex?  I never make out before sex.  A little bit.  Don't you just sometimes pull the covers over your head and kind of.  I get mad if my girlfriend's kissing me during sex.  Really?  Who does she usually pretend that you are?  You'd have to ask her.  I don't know.  She wouldn't have told me that.  Do you go down? 
[03:20:00]  Of course.  You have to do that.  Do you think she enjoys that?  I believe so.  I believe so.  What does it sound like when you do that?  That's already been documented, I think.  What does it sound like?  Let me hear it.  I'm going to hear it again.  No, I'm not going to play it.  You're going to do it again.  Yeah, what is it sound like?  I don't remember how I did it before.  That's the sound, I think.  What is it?  We have the sound.  But I want to hear you.  I don't have it on me.  You got it.  Do it.  Do it.  La, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la. 
[03:20:30]  I really thought we were here to talk about Iraq's wedding.  Oh.  I really feel like we've lost a lot of focus.  I took a left turn.  What was that noise again?  La, la, la.  You don't do that.  Are you a pussy?  Are you a good pussy eater?  I think, I mean, I don't know.  I've never done it to myself.  How do you do it?  Oh, you got a pussy?  No, that's what I'm saying.  I don't.  Oh.  How do you do it?  Yeah.  How do you do it?  There's a microphone.  Yeah, but how do you do it?  Just say it.  Describe it.  Why do you lick with my tongue?  What part do you lick?  The clitoris.  Fast?  I go with whatever the reaction would be at the time. 
[03:21:00]  I try to read.  An audible.  Yes.  That's what you're like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you wear bags when you fuck?  No.  All right.  Did you pull out?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  That's never 100%, my friend.  Well, no.  You always try to stay in as long as possible.  And if you've ever beat off, you notice sometimes.  I never have.  Before you, well, if you notice, sometimes before you're actually feeling like you're coming, 
[03:21:30]  there's some shit flying out.  A little bit.  So, you know, you don't think that's happening in a vagina?  I hope not.  You're going to wind up having a little baby.  That would be awful.  So when you, when you, when you, you don't want to have a kid?  Not at this moment.  I can't afford a television.  That would be awful.  Because I can't afford a television.  Yeah, a TV.  Russell Simmons helped me out.  Do you beat off in, in the relationship?  What do you mean?  Well, oh, well, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, where does she do it when you beat off?  Like, when she's not home?  Yeah, when she's not home, sure. 
[03:22:00]  What do you watch?  Pornography.  What kind?  Pornography.  But he said it weird.  How do you say that?  Well, I said pornography.  Pornography?  Pornography.  You watch pornography?  Pornography, yes.  What do you watch?  What kind of pornography?  I go to, what is he doing wrong with that word?  I don't know.  Pornography.  He's not saying pornography.  It's a little more high-class pronunciation.  Pornography.  Pornography.  Can we get, are we getting back to the wedding here?  Pono?  No.  Oh, porno.  Pono.  Oh, right.  The wedding. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, the wedding.  Unless you have more questions about his sex life.  No, it is, it is kind of hot because it's involving, you know.  Yeah, much more interested in his loads.  Yeah.  The stupid E-Rocks.  The fucking important day.  E-Rocks awful shoes.  Most important day in dummy's life.  Yeah.  And he's having his stay honeymoon.  That's, I told him he's got to go away.  His stay honeymoon.  You don't get married and go home.  That never works.  That's called life after you're married.  Yeah, you got to get the fun away.  How about you have to party first? 
[03:23:00]  Final little bash.  Here's his Facebook updates all week leading up to the wedding where the big change is about  to happen.  Everything changes and we were like, you've been engaged for three years.  How could anything change?  And he's lived with her, right?  Yes.  It's going to be the same thing when they go home.  Same exact thing.  Except her last name will be Nagel.  And I don't think they're married.  I already hear that.  That was a weird ceremony.  It was just quick.  Too quick and I didn't see no priest.  No, just big Kev's friend.  You got to have some kind of like lord figure.  Ah, my sister marries people, so.  So those are illegal too. 
[03:23:30]  Nah, they're pretty legal.  Pretty legal?  Yeah, I think so.  She got the thing off the back of a matchbook.  Is that true?  You could either draw a winky or become a fucking.  Holy shit.  Justice of the peace or whatever it is.  I don't even know what it is.  Alright, Eastside Dave.  So Eastside Dave did the wasabi.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then after Jess caught the bouquet, everybody was encouraging Eastside Dave to  go up and say something.  Like to convince me to propose to her or something.  Right. 
[03:24:00]  And Eastside Dave took the mic and started doing his Roddy Piper impression.  For no reason.  Just started yelling about Adrian Adonis.  Oh my god.  So they took the mic away from him.  And so for the rest of the night, he was fighting with the DJ trying to get the mic back.  He's classic, man.  Dave rules.  Yeah.  He's classic.  And then he finally did, at the end of the night, get the mic back.  Right.  Yeah.  For his rendition of Sweet Child of Mine.  Which everyone is talking about now.  Well, yeah, because he decided to get up, grab the mic, and start yelling, let's party, 
[03:24:30]  let's start throwing chairs.  And then he started taking chairs and throwing them across the dance floor.  Well, he also said, let's burn this place down.  No, no, no.  Let's burn this motherfucker down.  And he took one of the candles and put it under a table that had the draping all the way down  to the floor, and he puts it under there, knowing it's going to go into flames, and  then just walks away and lets someone else deal with that.  Well, you just saw, and then you see E-Rock run, so the place doesn't burn down at his 
[03:25:00]  wedding.  He said he was burning this motherfucker down.  I will say something about Troy, though.  He was making rude comments while the wedding was going on.  Was he?  Yeah.  About what?  E-Rock, which was surprising to me, because I thought they were friends.  Like weight?  Yeah, because E-Rock, I was thinking, you know what?  No making fun of E-Rock.  E-Rock, this is going to be a nice ceremony.  Let's go forward positive with this.  And the minute E-Rock's standing up there waiting for his lovely wife to walk down the  aisle, Troy whispers to me, would it have killed him to get on a treadmill?  And I'm going, is that appropriate, Troy? 
[03:25:30]  I thought you'd known this guy for 14 years.  Did he look heavy?  Well, it is known when you're...  He did.  He did look heavy.  He looked a little heavy.  Yeah.  It is known when you're getting ready for your own wedding.  You try to, you know, gain as much weight as possible.  You're supposed to look at your best.  Right.  You try.  You try to, like, get your shit together a little bit.  He knew he was engaged for how long?  Three years.  Maybe three fucking years, you know.  He had three years to get his shit together.  You could, you know, get a little muscle tone. 
[03:26:00]  He got engaged the same time Opie did, who Opie had a regular term engagement and then  has since celebrated a wedding, an anniversary, and a child.  Right.  Two years ago today, actually.  Today's the day and almost seven-month-old.  You were married two years ago?  Today, yeah.  Two years.  And Iraq was married two days ago.  Two days ago.  You have two years.  It was a little different.  So we got audio of Eastside Dave doing the sweet child of mine.  Oh, yes.  Kind of, I don't know, some say ruining Iraq's wedding. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  He also almost got into a fight with Big Kev.  Yeah.  Why what?  Well, because Big Kev and Eastside Dave don't get along.  I didn't know that.  Oh, that's right.  There was a lot of just issues all around.  And then Dave kept trying to approach Big Kev, and then he started getting drunker, and  he'd approach him and start saying nice things.  I just want us to get along.  I don't have a problem with fatso and saying things like, just upsetting Big Kev.  It wasn't cool.  It wasn't cool.  It was not cool. 
[03:27:00]  Dave.  I told Dave to stop.  All right.  Let's check it out.  Here's Eastside Dave doing sweet child of mine at E-Rock's wedding.  Okay, Anthony.  Mornings.  Ron and Fez.  Middays.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
