<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in crude, self-deprecating humor, before launching into a discussion about reported UFO sightings in New York City.  One host dismissed them as Mylar balloons, while another, identifying himself as a former governor and Navy SEAL (a claim not verified), insisted they were government-controlled flying saucers. This sparked a comedic, insult-laden exchange rife with racial and homophobic slurs.  The conversation then veered towards the Chilean miner rescue, with the hosts making jokes about the miners' personalities and circumstances, including a miner's mistress's arrival at the mine.  The UFO debate continued, fueled by caller accounts and ridicule of amateur UFO video footage.  A call from Stryker unsuccessfully attempted to redirect the discussion to an alleged underground city in Denver. Jesse Ventura's outlandish conspiracy theories were referenced throughout this segment.

The show next focused on the impending firing of Lee Abrams, the Chicago Tribune's Innovation Officer, for sending an email containing links to videos, including sexually suggestive content using the word "slut," to all employees. The hosts debated the appropriateness of the email and the ensuing outrage, contrasting the reaction with past workplace tolerance for edgy humor, speculating that fear of lawsuits drove the overreaction.  This led to a broader discussion about changing workplace culture and the decline of humor and casualness.  The hosts then recounted a story about a Tribune colleague fired for accidentally brushing a woman's buttocks with his erect penis, and mocked Abrams' title of "Innovation Officer."  They discussed Abrams' background, including his time at XM Satellite Radio and his impact on album-oriented rock radio.  The hosts shared personal anecdotes about their radio experiences, including stories about Randy Michaels' eccentric behavior, a tense negotiation with a radio company, and the lavish, somewhat chaotic retirement party of a Citadel executive, Fareed, and his then-wife's intoxicated behavior. They also mentioned their own investment losses in Citadel's bankruptcy.  The segment concluded with a review of a South Park episode satirizing Jersey Shore and New Jersey culture, including Al-Qaeda's involvement in fighting "Jerseyfication," followed by promotion of their "What the Hell is That" show and details about their upcoming Foxwoods Casino appearance, with humorous complaints about Jimmy Norton's hotel room.

The next segment centered on Jimmy Norton's poor hotel accommodations in Atlantic City, comparing his subpar Grand Cedar room to the luxurious MGM suites.  The hosts used vulgar language to describe the room and complained about the perceived unfairness of the room assignment, with Norton suggesting his drawing power deserved better treatment. They also discussed their upcoming show and Norton's need to take a shuttle to the venue. This transitioned into a "Jocktober" segment featuring clips from other radio shows, which Opie and Anthony critiqued harshly. This segment included tangents about Brett Favre's penis size, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's aging, and a bizarrely edited interview with Bill Clinton.  A listener called to criticize the "Jocktober" segments. The segment concluded with Vic Henley joining the show, leading to a discussion about skin cancer and doctor visits.

A significant portion of the show featured Vic Henley discussing his upcoming performance and a comedy cruise with Rosie O'Donnell and Anne Heche. The conversation then turned to hangovers, with anecdotes shared by Henley and the hosts, medical insights provided by Dr. Steve (a guest), and a story from Henley about a comedy routine involving the KKK and the concerns of Comedy Central staff. Henley also discussed his past experiences with friends dying from drug use and his fondness for "Walking Tall." Steve-O (of Jackass) then joined the show, discussing his sobriety, the new Jackass 3D movie (including dangerous stunts and injuries), his stand-up comedy, and his recovery from substance abuse, including his intervention and 51-50 hold, and an appearance on the Adam Carolla show while intoxicated. The segment ended with plans to secure Steve-O a stand-up gig.  Offensive language, including racial slurs and homophobic remarks, was present throughout.

The show’s final segment opened by acknowledging Steve-O’s improved physical and mental health. The hosts then promoted upcoming shows, including Jimmy Norton's performances at Foxwoods and Opie's gig at Bridge Street Live. They discussed ways Steve-O might maintain sobriety, including suggestions ranging from exercise to masturbation and pornography, and the common substitution of one bad habit for another. The conversation became rambling and vulgar, including anecdotes about a speeding ticket and one host's alleged FBI interactions.  They discussed their upcoming schedule, confirming Dr. Steve's participation in a "weird medicine" segment and Vic Henley’s potential return. The show ended with Opie complaining about a firewood delivery blocking his driveway.  Throughout the entire broadcast, offensive language, including racial slurs and homophobic remarks, was used frequently.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up!  Get us back to the funny.  But first, let's play this.  People understand we don't belong in radio, right?  Satellite radio douchebags?  I take that as like a compliment.  Yes, we suck a dick.  Sorry to everybody out there.  This is fucking satellite fuck dick radio. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  What a great show.  We heard you!  I don't want to make everyone feel bad,  but you know this is what old people sit around and do.  Pity porn, semen squirting, and shooting up the job.  Oh, what the fuck?  This morning has been, I feel like I'm on Jerry Springer.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah!  The show is on the road, mister.  We're off and running.  Listen, we're a little scared today because we got UFOs over New York City. 
[00:01:00]  They're hovering right now as we speak, Anthony.  Keep laughing.  I don't know what they want, but they're hovering.  Keep laughing.  I read someone said they were Mylar balloons.  You take that tack.  I'm going to go with my gut feeling being an ex-governor and Navy SEAL.  I know they're flying saucers sent by the government's space agency. 
[00:01:30]  Did you get on top of a building to get a closer look?  Yes, I looked.  You did?  Actually, I get my team together.  We're flying to New York.  Who's part of your team this time?  I don't know.  A black chick and some fag.  Were you doing that all night?  All night.  Were you?  I was going between him and Ira.  I was having conversations with myself all alone in my living room.  Well, you should have to hire a team up with Jesse.  That would be a good conspiracy team.  Get away, you Jew. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, we got some UFOs over in New York City.  People are losing their minds.  Did it make the paper?  Oh, yeah, it did.  Is it front page?  No.  It's in there a few pages.  It's one of those things that looks like they shoved in at the last minute.  Right.  It looks like those Mylar balloons that they let go of during weddings and parties and shit like that.  Yeah.  Anniversaries.  What the fuck ever?  The light was hitting it just right or something?  When the sunlight hits a Mylar balloon, even if it's just the size of the ones you buy at the stationery store, 
[00:02:30]  you see those fucking things miles away.  So that's all it is?  It's crazy.  That's my guess.  I'm not saying they're flying saucers.  There were a few of them.  And there were a couple that were bundled together.  If you let go of a bunch of balloons, some of them stay together, some of them go apart.  I saw balloons that were musical notes the other day.  I was like, I just look up at these black musical notes.  We're like floating in the sky.  It's like, oh, that's kind of cool.  Very nice.  I don't know what it was for or anything, but I was like, wow, that's a unique balloon.  I've never seen that before. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And people let go of fucking balloons.  Relax.  No, that looks like UFOs.  I believed you until I saw the pictures.  That's UFOs, my friend.  They're finally here.  There was one picture of it over Midtown.  It didn't look like balloons.  It looked like a craft.  But again, it might have just been that one angle.  I think it's one angle.  And then there was the spacemen.  Should they have been on the balloons?  Have you ever seen the documentary Independence Day?  Well, you laugh.  That is actual fact. 
[00:03:30]  It happened.  I was a former governor.  I know.  What about the Navy SEAL thing?  Shut up, Jimmy.  Thank you for your service.  What about the Navy SEAL thing?  I was a Navy SEAL.  Yeah, but this is in the air.  I was privy to that.  This is in the air.  I tried to swim up to them.  It's very hard.  Even though air is a fluid, it's hard to swim in it.  He's an ass.  Wouldn't the Air Force check it out?  And maybe they did.  Unless they're in on it.  Hello?  Jesse, they checked it out. 
[00:04:00]  The Air Force checked it out.  You're going to buy the government line on this one?  I sure am.  What's wrong with you?  I sure am.  Balloons?  What's more plausible?  That someone let go of some mylar balloons that flittered in the sun?  Or we're being invaded by UFOs?  What's more feasible to you?  I know it is to me.  I was on the inside.  I was a fighter.  A former governor.  A Navy SEAL.  And a balloon expert for about three months. 
[00:04:30]  What do you mean a balloon expert?  I filled him with helium.  Yeah?  Yeah, wrestling was a little slow.  Vince McMahon set me off for a while.  But I believe my newspapers.  It says Manhattan Spark UFO Frenzy.  Exactly.  You believe the newspapers?  Come on now.  Did you serve in the service?  Uh, no.  Then you don't know about the newspapers.  I just confused you.  End of story.  Just completely blew apart your argument, didn't I?  No, I blew apart yours. 
[00:05:00]  I agree with you.  Well, you could say that, but I'm bigger and can beat you up.  So I win.  You are a bully.  Thanks, tough guy.  You're a cyber bully.  So why don't you shut up, Jimmy?  I don't want to get into it again with you.  Make me look stupid again.  I agreed with you.  I said Manhattan Spark UFO Frenzy.  I'm saying they are UFOs.  Well, they're balloons, dummy.  Oh.  What?  You say they're UFOs.  I say they're balloons.  So your whole thing is you don't want to...  You say they're balloons. 
[00:05:30]  I say they're UFOs.  Oh, so your thing is you don't want to agree with anyone ever.  That's the only way my show continues.  If I disagree with the logical or everyone else.  So as soon as you agree with somebody, then your show's over.  Show's off the air.  God.  Exactly.  They are our flying cars.  So are they UFOs or not?  Exactly.  Are they?  Yes.  I say yes, then.  No.  Balloons.  Then I say no.  UFOs.  Who's on first? 
[00:06:00]  Exactly.  Who was on second, though?  It was a conspiracy by the little fat man with the dead kid in the pool.  Who's working with you these days?  The blue meanie?  Who do you got?  Goldust?  Actually...  Ivan Putzky?  Who's out of work that you're hiring?  I actually like the ultimate warrior.  The ultimate warrior's on your team?  He's the only one that makes any sense.  Warriors.  Warrior says...  Warrior!  And he's a UFO expert. 
[00:06:30]  Or a balloon expert, depending on how you're looking at this.  Maybe the warrior let these balloons loose over Manhattan.  Former governor.  And they won't let me in.  I don't understand.  I tried to get into the core of a nuclear power plant.  They wouldn't let me.  I'm a former governor.  Why won't they let you into these places?  Something about immense doses of radiation.  I said, I can't lose any more hair. 
[00:07:00]  They were just trying to protect you, sir.  No, that...  If that's what you want to believe.  That's what they were doing.  Protect me from what?  Radiation!  No!  No!  There's no radiation.  They're having secret meetings in there.  Politicians!  I was on the inside.  I was a governor.  A fighter.  I was...  What else was I?  A Navy SEAL.  A Navy SEAL.  A balloon blower-upper.  And a nuclear engineer.  But I always wanted to be a beat cop. 
[00:07:30]  Really?  Why?  Yes.  Well, I was lost one day, and they gave me an ice cream cone and a hat turned sideways.  And you never forgot that?  It was a long time ago.  I looked adorable.  It was like our gang.  Sitting on a stoop somewhere, all scared?  Who do you call in a stoop?  He's so fucked up!  Stupid Jesse.  I can't get enough of him.  And I haven't put the DVD away of his first show of this coming up season, so it's sitting 
[00:08:00]  on one of the tables in my living room, and every time I pass by him, I just look right  at the picture, and no one's in my house.  I'm a lunatic.  I look right at it and go, mind control!  Fucking crazy!  He's got you in your own house.  He's got me!  He's controlling your mind.  Who nailed it yesterday?  He's on Larry King.  He pretty much solved the JFK thing, but he decided not to tell the world on CNN.  He's going to wait for his dumb show.  I mention that cleverly.  Jimmy, you mention it.  A lot less people will watch it on True TV. 
[00:08:30]  He's going to wait.  I mean, I'm going to wait.  What a dummy, right?  I was on the Warren Commission, and a Navy SEAL, and a balloon blower upper, and I wore  feather boas, which makes me an expert in the chicken industry or something.  With my riffraff hairdo.  I watched that clip recently.  Holy fuck.  Unbelievable.  The way he's looking, and his head's shaking. 
[00:09:00]  Was he in here yesterday?  Yeah, he was in the building.  I did the Howard Stern show.  Is Howard kissing his ass?  No!  How does Howard handle him?  Howard likes him.  I think he just handles him like...  We like him, but we...  He can handle him like a goof.  He doesn't really go back and forth with him too much.  He gets a little goofy with him, more than serious.  Yeah, because you can't be serious with a guy.  You can't be taking his angle on this crap.  He kind of just lets Jesse talk.  He goes way too far with his theories and conspiracies. 
[00:09:30]  I don't have time to bleed.  Yeah.  But as soon as I saw the UFOs over Manhattan, I'm like, oh boy, here comes Jesse.  Here comes Jesse Ventura.  There were balloons.  What are you talking about?  I mean, yeah, that's what I say.  They were balloons.  We ought to look into these UFOs.  So you think they're UFOs?  Then I think they're UFOs.  Balloons!  UFOs.  We can get to 10 o'clock doing that.  That's the goal.  It's a conspiracy from the show. 
[00:10:00]  And in other news, the miners are out of the hole.  Yes.  Finally.  Thank God.  When did you give up on the rescue?  After fucking guy number three, I was like, all right.  I think I made it to about 13 or 14 myself.  Wow, really?  Sure.  That was during the show yesterday, so we kind of had to.  Oh, no, I was done.  I was done after that.  My interest, like, what's the first two guys came up and the thing was working?  Right.  It's like, all right, it's fucking work.  Yeah, this is just a matter of time now.  So watch that. 
[00:10:30]  Who made it all the way to the end?  What did they do for the last guy out?  Anything?  Oh, it was great.  Remember we were talking yesterday that the last guy out is going to be the guy.  Yeah, they threw an M80 in the cage.  Wake her up her.  It was the foreman.  He was the guy that came up last.  The guy that kind of got everybody together and rationed out everything.  He was kind of the boss of the whole thing.  He was the last guy up.  But, again, not the most popular.  I think people lost interest.  I think that guy that was waving the flag around and fucking... 
[00:11:00]  There's three guys.  Yeah, yeah.  There's three stars in this whole thing.  You got the flag guy.  You got the flag guy.  Then you got the guy whose mistress was waiting for him.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wife was at home.  Mistress showed up at the hole when he got out.  By the way, mistress, pig.  Yeah, what does the wife look like?  Oh, she's awful to us.  Oh, is she?  I understood why he was fucking the mistress.  Wow.  The mistress is hotter than the wife because the mistress is rough looking.  Yeah, the mistress is like fucking Brittany next to the wife.  Oh, shit.  And then, yes, you said it.  The Elvis guy.  Elvis guy.  I don't know about any of the other guys. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, and the old guy we knew for about a minute.  Yeah, he didn't really do much, though.  He waved the flag a little.  He said, eh, no one's going to remember him.  There's like three guys.  They invited the Elvis guy to Graceland.  They wanted him to come up to Graceland and hang out because he's a big Elvis fan.  Problem is, he doesn't have any vacation time left.  Yeah.  I know.  Get back to work.  Exactly.  The thing is, it's like, we're like, wow, chilly.  That's great.  They took care of their guys.  They brought them up.  It's chilly.  They're probably going to be like, all right, back in the fucking mind.  Back to work on Monday.  We'll give you the rest of the week off. 
[00:12:00]  Pay for your tin shack.  But that's it.  Just so we'll give you the next two days off so your eyes adjust.  Yeah.  And then back in.  That would be great.  They take the glasses off and they have pure white mole eyes.  Yeah.  Old people.  Never go back.  Like, you think any of these guys are going to want to just live the rest of their lives  underground now?  They got a taste and said, you know what?  I can't take the world.  Someone Twittered that they have to all meet at some certain place and get back together  again.  Oh, for the fear. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Nice lost ending.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I thought for some homosexual activities.  Homosexuals.  Yeah.  We had some outrageous things to say about that yesterday.  Yeah.  Did the sunglasses, did any news touch on the sunglasses?  Yeah, they're Oakley's.  They look like Oakley's.  How about some Ray-Bans for the poor motherfuckers?  They look like Jose Canseco type sunglasses for everybody.  Yeah, they do.  They do.  They were all in great shape.  Yeah.  They had plenty of room down there. 
[00:13:00]  A lot of room for exercise and shit.  I heard there was an underground waterfall even, so they could shower off a bit.  It looked like the fucking phase two of the Rathacon, the Genesis device inside the planet.  It's apparently where they were.  Oh, Opie.  Star Trek stuff.  Yeah.  That's when you lose me.  When Starfleet tunneled out a little thing, and then they set off the Genesis device inside the planet, and it made like the whole Oasis in there.  Apparently that's what.  I'll just leave the Star Trek stuff alone.  Someone out there got it. 
[00:13:30]  A lot of people got it.  Con!  Well, I know that.  Con!  I know the con thing.  Con!  He was very angry.  Stryker's on the phone.  Shud reference.  Shut up.  Yeah, it's Shud reference.  Stryker's on the phone for Jesse Ventura.  Stryker.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, uh, Monday, Anthony, you brought up about the, uh, uh, hidden compound.  Uh, Stryker, what's wrong with you?  Anthony did not bring up anything on Monday's show.  Jesse Ventura did.  I'm sorry.  He mentioned Jesse Ventura bringing it up. 
[00:14:00]  I apologize.  All right.  Just go along with the bit, would you?  Yeah, Stryker, how are you listening?  What do you want to say to Jesse Ventura?  Yeah, uh, Jesse...  Like, also, Stryker wants to do a real fucking news story.  ...on the underground city in Denver.  Who gives a fuck?  We could care less.  I know it's there.  I've seen it with my own eyes.  Not really.  But I've heard from people that have seen it from other people's cousins' uncles. 
[00:14:30]  The same people...  Shut up.  It's the same people that talked to the person that had their kidney removed in a hotel room  and was left with a note in a tub full of ice.  It happened.  I know the person.  I was at the wedding when they turned the plates over and had pictures of the best man  having sex with the groom or bride.  Why is that a conspiracy, Jesse?  Well, you talk about it.  Why?  Because... 
[00:15:00]  Why is that a conspiracy?  People didn't think it didn't happen.  That's just someone with a grudge.  People think it didn't happen, but we all know it did.  How can you prove it?  Do you think it happened?  How can you prove it?  Do you think it happened?  No.  Then it happened.  Well, maybe it did happen then.  Never happened.  Got to keep my show on the air.  All right, Stryker, your phone call was a bust because you didn't want to go with the  Jesse Ventura thing.  Stryker, I don't even know her.  I'm funny, too.  He basically wanted to prove that there's no underground city in Denver. 
[00:15:30]  I think we all know that.  I think it has something to do with the fucking Denver airport.  Yeah.  What is it?  Is that the largest airport in the country now?  I don't know if it's the largest one.  It's up there, right?  Looks cool when you come in.  Looks like little snow caps.  Now, John on Long Island, we don't have to go to his call, it says, there was a guy  who wrote a book that said yesterday would be a worldwide UFO sighting.  Now, here's how this works.  If there's a guy that wrote a book that says that, then fans of the fucking book are like,  you know what?  Today would be a great day to get some fake UFO shit up in the air. 
[00:16:00]  It's not the other way around.  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  John, who wrote this book?  He was actually an ex-NORAD commander.  Okay.  And he said what?  Yesterday, which was the 13th of October, would be a big UFO day?  Yes.  Yesterday would be a worldwide display of UFOs.  So what happened to the rest of the world?  Not enough balloons?  That I don't know.  But I do know that where I was in Brooklyn, you could definitely see them, and they were UFOs. 
[00:16:30]  Why did he say yesterday?  Why did he name yesterday?  I'm not sure why he picked yesterday.  Yes.  Apparently, he had some kind of whatever contact he did in NORAD, and he came out and wrote a book about it.  So...  But you could tell that these things yesterday were definitely not balloons.  They were moving around in linear patterns.  Linear patterns?  Like with air currents?  So if there's five things together, they're going to move around in the same direction, aren't they? 
[00:17:00]  Well, there were three separate objects from where I was looking at.  Yeah.  Changing colors from red to clear, then disappearing, moving right.  Right, right.  As a balloon turns, it'll pick up and diffract light differently.  Sure.  Okay.  Yeah.  There was a good...  Moving at...  Okay.  I love this.  Go ahead.  They were moving at rapid rates of speed, disappearing, reappearing.  Mm-hmm.  Caught in the wind, reflecting the sky.  Gotcha.  They definitely...  Being made into certain animals at a party.  By some drunk falling down on my floor at a party. 
[00:17:30]  Janine.  Was she drunk?  She makes balloon animals for everybody.  Janine is the Snooki of my house at parties.  Is she an alky?  Oh, God.  Is she a waste?  She's just falling down my stairs.  Oh, that's right.  Bumping into the columns.  Lickered up idiot.  Do we have, like, an official statement from the Air Force or anything about this UFO thing?  Yes and no.  We got Air Force people that are in the sky within seconds when shit is happening. 
[00:18:00]  They checked with...  Because the police started getting a lot of calls because everyone's nervous Nellies whenever anything's over fucking New York anymore.  Of course.  So they started getting calls.  They checked with all the area airports.  Yeah.  They checked with the Air Force, any of the military, and said there was nothing.  They checked their radar.  They didn't see anything.  Yeah.  This was just something people saw floating in the air.  A silver balloon will change color.  It will look as if it disappears if it turns a certain way. 
[00:18:30]  And it will move in different directions.  It'll make quick turns when it hits different air currents.  If it's going straight up and then at, you say, 1,000 feet, 1,500 feet, there's an air current that's sweeping one way.  All of a sudden, that balloon's going to make a quick turn one way and you go, oh, my God, it turned like no object I've ever seen.  Why can't you tell it's a balloon then?  Because it's so...  Just taking the other side here for a second. 
[00:19:00]  Because it's very...  It's glaring.  You can't even focus on it well.  Anthony.  It's a glaring, sunlit, fucking silver thing.  It's like looking at a mirror.  What time of the day did this all go down?  Was it weird for those UFOs to have big strings hanging off them?  Those are docking strings.  I don't know.  They were actually varying formations.  They were, you see them sometimes in triangles.  They would disappear, reappear in different formations, disappear again.  Of course, different formations.  They're balloons moving independently and then sometimes moving together. 
[00:19:30]  I like to say willy-nilly.  Imperfect triangular formation.  If there's three balloons in the air, it's going to be a triangle.  Do you understand?  Three points make a triangle unless they're all lined up.  I didn't see any video that...  Sir, I didn't see any video.  The only video I saw, they looked like balloons.  Let's get some video.  It's all over YouTube.  I know.  All right, John.  So this guy wrote a book and UFOs were in the sky yesterday. 
[00:20:00]  I would think that if there are fans of the book, then they were picked yesterday to throw some shit up.  What is that guy saying?  I kind of believe that there's some shit out there, but I don't think they were over Manhattan yesterday.  I think any of the shit you see is Earth-based shit that we came up with.  A lot of UFO sightings happened over the skunk works when they were building the stealth planes and shit.  And then you find out later on, there were these fucking stealth planes.  I saw nothing but these lights. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, because the plane's fucking black.  It flies at night.  Look, it's like...  Yeah, well, the video...  He's got his finger in the lens.  People take the worst video.  You don't even know how to film a fucking UFO.  Oh, shit.  Gloria Rodriguez.  Well, I saw it.  Oh, wait, yeah.  ...is the first thing I thought.  Because it was really far away.  Shouldn't she be waiting for someone to get a mine?  And they were disappearing, and you would see them again.  I'm sorry.  I don't care.  I had no explanation for it.  My belief, I don't really believe that it was a UFO.  But I could be wrong. 
[00:21:00]  You see crazier things in New York, don't you?  No word on the little green men as of yet.  That's right.  Well, officials say that they believe the object was some sort of a balloon, but as of yet,  now they haven't confirmed exactly what it was just yet.  And hence, it's a UFO.  Anyway, you may need more time for your next coffee break.  Now, try to...  Oh, shut up.  We could have had extraterrestrials.  Right.  But coming up, what happens...  Yeah.  Let's do a coffee story.  We might have been visited from another world yesterday.  And by the way, I hate when people use the term UFO as if it means flying saucer. 
[00:21:30]  They're like, I think it was a UFO.  That's anything they don't know.  It means unidentified flying object.  Officially, it was a UFO?  It was a UFO.  Officially.  No one identified it.  It was flying, and it was indeed some type of object.  It's perfect.  It doesn't mean a flying saucer.  It's perfect for the news, because they could say that.  Yeah.  A UFO over Manhattan yesterday.  UFO over New York City.  Was it a spaceship, though?  Yeah.  Was it some kind of alien spacecraft?  No.  There's been a lot of...  The ones in the military always...  And any type of eyewitness that's an airline pilot... 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  ...because those guys never want to be quoted as to who they are.  And any time in the military...  When you hear about, like, the 1960s, there was a military thing, and they had to...  Like, where it affected 10 nuclear missiles, it just shut them...  All they all started were turned on, and they all got turned off.  It was some weird thing I read about recently that was actually very believable.  I absolutely think all those things were the military working on some anti-Soviet shit,  or the Soviets working on anti-American shit. 
[00:22:30]  I really do, because there was so much more of that activity during the height of the Cold  War than any other time.  And you could say, because the aliens knew that we were ready to destroy ourselves, man!  Shut up!  We were both poking each other with fucking sticks.  When they were making the stealth bomber, they had to fly that shit around without telling  too many people, right?  They did, and there was a fucking bunch of sightings of that.  And then if you're a dope on the ground, you see a stealth bomber go by in the 60s, or 
[00:23:00]  whatever year it would be, you'd be out of your mind going, that's a UFO.  You still get people driving up to Groom Lake with binoculars going like,  that's where they keep the aliens, that's where they keep them.  And it's like, no, that's where they built the fucking stealth fighter and the bombers.  And they're not going to tell everybody.  They're not telling anybody.  No, I mean, they're not going to tell everyone in the military either.  There's an airstrip there, too.  Oh, yeah?  They fly people in every day.  Yeah, it helps out with the eight-hour driving commute, dummy. 
[00:23:30]  They fly their employees in because it's in the middle of the desert, stupid.  So they can experiment with this new aircraft.  Exactly.  Because the first military things, I believe, though, like the military ones, they're not  going to test military stuff on other military people.  Back then, I think they did a lot more things that were a little more shady than they do  now.  I think they tested on military equipment.  There's documented the testing of LSD on soldiers. 
[00:24:00]  Of course, we remember the Tuskegee experiments.  Yeah, goddammit.  Give me shifflers.  These fucking guys don't know how to film shit.  I know.  There's a UFO possibly meaning a spacecraft in the sky, and this guy has his thumb over  the camera.  The first thing he should do is take a kneeling position and rest the camera on his knee  to stabilize it, and then zoom in and hold it steady.  And how about you start walking toward it?  He's an asshole.  Look, what is he filming now? 
[00:24:30]  Oh, god.  This guy sucks.  He's a douchebag.  He's filming the sidewalk.  Now he's sideways.  Now it makes sense.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking dope.  You know what's funny?  That'd be, yo.  Of course.  He films himself.  Yeah.  Flying above us.  Where?  You lost it because you were too busy filming everything else.  Stay by here, Lex reporting, and I'm out.  Yeah, you're out.  What a dope.  You're an idiot.  Give me another one.  Did someone film this properly?  There has to be in New York a bunch of film of it.  Right?  What is this one? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, there's one, two, three, four.  I saw a bunch of dots.  And there's more of them coming from there.  Look at that.  They're balloons, I think.  They're balloons, I think.  Well, we don't know because you're filming the side of a windowsill now, idiot.  Get your camera outside.  Zoom in and stabilize.  How?  How?  What's that?  I like the fact that we're mad that people don't know how to film extraterrestrials.  They don't know how to film anything.  I don't know anything. 
[00:25:30]  What does that look like?  What does he film?  There's so many of them.  And then I'll just shut my camera off because there's so many, and I'm very scared.  That's another video that was a bus.  Give me another one.  Oh, my God.  I got to call my mother.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Here's another guy.  Hey, Elliot 51.  Elliot 51, my David.  We have to get along.  Is it black and white?  Shut up.  It was terrible.  Horrible.  That's just a picture?  And this guy has a picture of a white dot in the sky. 
[00:26:00]  That's good.  All right.  They were just dumb balloons.  There's one, two, three dots.  Everyone has phone cameras now.  No one got any video that's worth checking out.  No one got anything.  It's New York City.  It's more than just phone cameras.  There are fucking cameras everywhere.  There are news crews out all the time.  Jesus Christ.  Enough with the UFOs.  No UFOs.  Oh, no UFOs?  All right.  Balloons.  UFO.  Let me say hi to Paul in PA.  He's got to tell us about a UFO sighting in Chile. 
[00:26:30]  Hey there, Paul.  Go ahead, Paul.  Hey, guys.  There were 33 of them.  Underground faggot oralists.  That was worth it.  Thank you, sir.  Holy fucking God.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah, exactly.  I can't go on after that.  Underground faggot oralists.  Oh.  That made my neck hurt.  What is that UFO sighting?  That is a picture.  That's a plate.  It's two plates on top of each other. 
[00:27:00]  No.  Of course not.  That's one of those 50s.  And as I was in my backyard, I saw an object.  So I grabbed my camera and my gunpowder so I could get a flash.  You know, Kyle in California has got a good point.  Every other person in New York has a telescope to look at fucking naked chicks.  Yeah.  Did someone fucking decide to use the telescope for something else yesterday?  It's a much better story when it's UFOs.  And take a closer look.  Flying saucers, then balloons.  That's what it is.  That's it.  News will be all about this one today, though. 
[00:27:30]  I know.  We're not going to be able to avoid this one.  The big stories today, all the Chileans are out, the fucking UFOs, and apparently Starbucks  has decided the line moves much too quickly, and they have to slow every fucking thing down.  What are they doing?  What?  Oh, yeah.  That's what that story's about?  Yeah, next month Starbucks is...  You've got to wait forever for your coffee at this point.  Yeah, well, get this now.  Starbucks is enacting this thing next month to make it a little more, I don't know, a little  more like the old coffee shop it used to be, like when it started. 
[00:28:00]  So they're not going to foam up entire pitchers anymore to make multiple drinks.  They're only allowed to make two drinks at a time.  Do you know how much business they're going to lose?  It's crazy.  How many times do they leave a Starbucks because the line's too long?  It'll be more efficient, they say.  How is that more efficient?  I used to be a huge fan of Starbucks.  I search out any other coffee shop in Manhattan now.  Yeah.  It's just not the same coffee.  I'm drinking it this morning because there's not a lot of other coffee shops around.  It's addicting.  Why is it addicting?  It really is not great. 
[00:28:30]  It used to be addicting.  We just got used to it.  Yeah, I think so.  It's not as good as it used to be, man.  When Starbucks first hit, it was amazing how good their coffee was.  They have to individually foam the milk now and shit.  What are they doing?  Instead of the pitcher where then if they got three drinks or four drinks in front of them,  they could flop it all out.  What, did they decide that they were too successful?  That's it.  They're trying to fuck it up.  The coffee is overcooked.  It's like almost on the burnt side now.  Yeah.  Maybe deal with that issue.  With, I don't know. 
[00:29:00]  I'm trying to look into the rumor that they've merged with Sirius, and that's why they're  doing this.  See, I make a joke of it.  I was in a good mood, too.  Why'd you have to bring up?  Because that would be something funny.  But it would be funny if we were not allowed to have free Starbucks coffee.  Yeah.  They sent us to the break room and charged us for it.  Someone asked me if I was going to go to the World Series this year, and I go, not after  what happened to Anthony last year.  Oh, my God.  I'm not asking anyone for nothing around here.  I've never paid a dime.  Well, good for you.  You want to go to the World Series, do you? 
[00:29:30]  I do.  I want to go to the World Series.  I want to go to the playoffs.  How much did the World Series cost you last year?  Well, they wanted me to pay for the tickets.  After you asked for tickets.  A couple hundred bucks a pop for tickets.  And then they gave you a bill.  And then it was like, I got an envelope a few months later, and I was like, oh, what's  this?  It's like, well, it's an invoice for the World Series tickets.  And I'm like, don't I work here?  Like, don't you run Major League Baseball? 
[00:30:00]  Isn't this kind of a...  Like a perk?  I'm not the fucking governor.  I'm allowed to get...  I'm not the governor.  I'm allowed to get tickets and go to the game.  Maybe you're not anymore.  I don't know.  I mean, that's...  I don't know.  Remember when you used to work for a company and you got perks?  Oh, Coke and fucking whores.  Oh, the perks.  I'm sorry.  I thought you meant those perks.  I think they've taken the perks away from the employees, too.  Taken all the perks away?  I believe so.  Every perk has to be accounted for?  I believe so.  Well, they handed me a bill and I summarily filed it in the same place I filed my Windows 
[00:30:30]  Vista disc.  Oh, fuck.  Dude, you threw it out and destroyed it.  I put it in my shredder.  Good for you, man.  I thought you paid for it.  No.  Good for you.  No.  That's good.  Now the bill will be forthcoming.  I know.  Should camp it under your head.  It'll end up in the same spot, right in my shredder.  I won't pay it.  What are they going to do?  Sue me!  Take me to court!  Oh, yeah.  End E-Rock's wedding invitation.  Ride the shredder.  Oh, it looked so cute, just going, meh, coming out in a hundred pieces. 
[00:31:00]  You should have filmed it.  I handed him the video.  Oh!  Poor sweetie.  That's terrible.  She just wants to live a happy day after.  I just can't make it, E-Rock, and I don't leave, like, mail sitting around.  I felt bad about it, but, um...  How does a shredder work?  Can't you just fucking piece them together?  Oh, no.  You need a double-cut shredder.  One that goes through and shreds it into shreds, and then it also cross-cuts.  Some, and makes confetti out of it.  Yeah, but if you have all those paper, can't you put them together if it's real documents? 
[00:31:30]  Look, if someone wants to go through all that shit...  God bless them.  Yeah, have fun.  Have you ever looked at what it looks like?  But they're all in a row!  Not really.  No, I mix this shit up before I throw it away.  And then, a lot of times during the winter, I just throw it in the fucking fireplace.  Fuck you!  Oh, that's great kindling, right?  Oh, it's a great way to start a little fire.  Wait, get back to the Starbucks thing.  That's really what they're up to?  Intern's thank you letter.  Whap!  Intern's thank you letter. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah, please.  Do you remember his name?  Dustin.  No.  Dustin.  Oh, thanks.  I had no idea.  I thought you were reaching for...  Oof.  He might as well be called Dustin the Wind to me.  Oh.  Goodbye!  Yeah.  Goodbye!  Or maybe Dustin the Fan.  Which would be pretty windy, Chip.  Sure would be.  So that's the Starbucks story.  Yeah, yeah.  They're slowing things down to make it seem more like that original Starbucks kind of experience 
[00:32:30]  that people had.  Long lines.  How about you don't hire the first person that comes in for a job?  Hey, leave me alone.  I'm a barista.  Oh, Patty.  Whenever...  She was on Ronda Fez, and I'm listening to that fucking voice, and she's just talking  about Starbucks and how she works, and I'm up to five hours of vacation time.  I've been there for four years.  I know you don't like people, but doesn't that infuriate you on some level? 
[00:33:00]  Infuriate me about Patty or about Starbucks?  There's people out there taking advantage of people like Patty.  Like us?  I don't need...  We fucking gave her a life.  What are you talking about?  She was a fucking nothing before she met us.  Better than having a Mexican there.  She had to go through some shit to fucking get that life.  Like crawling naked through a mouse trap.  Well, she did have a Krusty the Clown hat on and a mask on.  She protected her dignity.  Yes, she did.  My dignity and my hygiene.  But five hours of vacation? 
[00:33:30]  Five hours vacation.  She goes, sometimes I like to take an hour or two break, so I have that ability with my  vacation time.  Oh, God.  So angering.  No, I don't care.  Go ahead, Starbucks.  Fucking higher retards.  Well, you're not a coffee guy, so...  No, I drink water.  I drink fucking V8.  I look forward to other coffee shops popping up.  It's time.  Hey, our old pal.  We got an update on one of our old pals. 
[00:34:00]  He's in deep shit.  Might get fired.  I might be fired.  Isn't that fun to do?  I'm trying.  Were you doing it at home?  Oh, yeah, I do it all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember Lee?  No, no.  I think I'm going to watch Seinfeld.  I don't know.  Where's the guide?  I'm going to hit the remote so I can see the guide.  They're trying to drag Tiger Woods into a story today about Federer. 
[00:34:30]  About what?  I think Roger Federer.  Is it Federer?  Federer.  His agent was doing some shady betting about a tennis match, but he also represents Tiger  Woods, so now it's all about Tiger Woods today.  Oh, God.  I show Tiger.  So why don't they show Federer?  Yeah.  We'll get into the story later.  I think it was a tennis thing.  But remember Lee Abrams?  Okay, terrific.  He was the mad scientist at XM?  Yes, the wacky, white-haired wizard that flew his own airplane. 
[00:35:00]  Really knows fucking radio?  Yeah.  Really knows it.  Knows old school radio.  Old school radio.  I think we got some production pieces with Lee Abrams.  Maybe we could play one of those, or one of the liners he did for us.  Yeah.  He would tell us about the old school radio.  And we would nap.  Yeah, well, he's a historian.  I mean, he also has a plane, and he used to fly employees around just to have lunch in  like Nantucket for the afternoon and then fly back to Washington.  You know, there once was a man from Nantucket.  There sure was.  What happened to him?  I don't know.  I just heard it was a guy from there once. 
[00:35:30]  So, Lee Abrams moved on after the two companies merged here, Sirius and XM.  He went on to...  Did he move on with a boot mark in his ass, or did he just move on?  Because a lot of people just moved on.  Yeah, it was one of those fake move-ons.  Yeah.  It was really, you know, it was...  We both agreed it was time for me to go.  They opened the door and kicked me in the ass, and I left.  Sirius decided after the merger that if you had creativity, you really needed to go find  somewhere else to work. 
[00:36:00]  That's how I look at it.  If you look at the people that have left...  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Creativity.  What's that?  We don't need that here.  Keep that away.  We need corporate guys.  More ties.  And ties.  Yeah, Lee Abrams was one of those I-don't-wear-a-tie guy.  No, hippie tie-dyed shirt guy.  So he left to pursue other things, as they like to say.  Yeah.  He went on to Tribune.  I like when people pursue unemployment line.  That's great.  He went on to just pursue other ventures, standing on the unemployment line. 
[00:36:30]  And you, as an employee that still gets to work, you feel good about the guy.  Like, oh, that's nice.  Oh, good.  He's moving on.  He's got something.  And then you take a lunch break, and you see that guy that was moving on to other opportunities.  What are you doing, dude?  Fuck, man.  I'm trying to get an extension.  Right.  They're going to cut my benefits.  I'm fucked.  I'm going to lose my house.  Is this what you were moving on to?  Yeah, exactly.  The company memo said they're happy that you're moving on.  And he's playing spackle buckets in Times Square. 
[00:37:00]  They wished you the best of luck.  What?  This is what you moved on to?  Yes, I'm moving on.  I'm just moving on to other ventures.  Singing badly in a subway somewhere.  Five bucks.  Put it in the hole in the wall.  With a fucking hat in front of them.  These were your new opportunities, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all bullshit.  We all know that.  So Lee Abrams moved on to Tribune with Randy Michaels, who's a lunatic.  Yeah.  In his own right.  And Randy Michaels is basically hinting that Mr. Abrams is going to be fired for sending out an email. 
[00:37:30]  And we know Lee Abrams.  Yeah.  But the world has caught up with Lee Abrams.  It's kind of like that Shawshank Redemption thing.  Yep.  Lee Abrams has lived his life the way he wants to live it.  And finally, the corporate world has caught up with Mr. Abrams.  It's time to just carve, boring guy was here, and hang himself.  So good old Lee, who I love. 
[00:38:00]  I love this fucking guy.  I really do.  He's a talent.  Lee Abrams, Tribune's chief innovation officer, has been placed on indefinite suspension without pay,  pending review of a company-wide memo he sent to staff Monday that spurred a rash of employee complaints.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you want the innovation guy to be the kind of weird, a little out of the box kind of...  That's the innovation guy you would want.  Right. 
[00:38:30]  He sent a video that was very funny.  It came from the onion.  Yeah, before you say what the video is, we wouldn't even be able to send this around here anymore.  Oh my God, you'd be fired immediately.  And Tribune's a bit more highbrow than this place.  But he was thinking, look, man, we're all working together.  I found something funny.  Let me give everyone a little laugh.  This is my world.  It's a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who complained?  A lot.  A rash of employee complaints.  A rash of complaints. 
[00:39:00]  And then, of course, Lee Abrams immediately, because he wants to keep his gig, threw out an apology.  Oh, Lee, you didn't.  The fake apology.  To everyone who was offended by the email that included a link to a video labeled...  Labeled sluts.  He thought it was a good idea to send a video to everyone labeled sluts.  Sluts.  That included female nudity.  He lost his fucking mind.  It really...  You know what?  He should be fired.  What am I saying?  It was hysterical. 
[00:39:30]  He's a rock star, man.  This guy's a rebel.  The incident followed by, less than a week, a New York Times front page story that characterized  Tribune company management as fostering a sexist frat house atmosphere.  Oh, okay.  So there was a big article in the Times, and then he sends this out after that.  He got the double whammy.  Lee recognized that the video was in extremely bad taste, and that it offended employees.  Randy Michaels said in the memo announcing the suspension.  We know Randy Michaels a little bit.  He loved the fucking video that Lee Abrams sent out. 
[00:40:00]  He can't say that to the world.  Go fuck complainers about the fucking material going around.  If someone wants to send something in an email, and you say it, there would be shit that  I would be maybe offended politically or something.  I wouldn't complain.  I'd just be like, oh, fuck it.  Fuck this.  You wouldn't run to human resources.  No.  Why is it?  It doesn't just happen here or at Tribune.  It happens at pretty much everywhere.  It's the minority of people that aren't enjoying this stuff. 
[00:40:30]  You used to be able to do things.  That makes it bad for everybody else.  You used to be able to.  Why can't you go with the majority?  Why can't you get everyone in a conference room and go, okay, who's offended by the slut  video?  And if more people raise their hands than don't, then there's a problem.  Why not?  It's America.  And if not, everything's fine.  Why does everyone have to suffer?  Because there's a few people at your workplace that don't want to see a calendar with bikini  girls, let's say.  You used to be able to have that in your cubicle.  You know something?  You could probably find it. 
[00:41:00]  Although, I don't know if Sam can.  I can.  Danny would have been able to.  Yeah, Danny definitely would have.  A cubicle from like the 60s or even early 70s.  70s, early 80s.  And a cubicle from now and what you used to be able to get away with.  All right.  Like, there you...  But it's not even just like...  Not just cubicles.  In a garage?  We don't even talk nudity anymore.  But you obviously can't have a picture of a girl in a bikini in your cubicle anymore. 
[00:41:30]  But they're also...  Political stuff.  They're also taking the political stuff down, the cartoons that might be a little edgy,  the comic strips, which we hate, obviously, in this show.  But some people see a comic strip they can relate to and they put it up in their cubicle.  You can't do that anymore.  Some people used to enjoy them.  You probably can't even put a family picture in there because not everyone has families  at the workplace.  You know what?  It offends the people that don't have families.  It offends barren women.  It offends women who like to drink and don't want to fucking bring a freak into the world.  So, as Sam finds out, Lee recognized that the video was in extremely bad taste and that 
[00:42:00]  it offended employees, Randy Michaels said.  But this is the kind of serious mistake that can't be tolerated.  We intend to address it promptly and forcefully.  Wow.  That means Lee Abrams will be fired over this.  Who actually released that statement?  Randy Michaels, who Anthony and I know a little bit, and this guy likes this type of stuff.  He loves it.  He worked for Clear Channel.  He wanted to hire us.  In the heyday.  So bad.  Yeah.  So bad. 
[00:42:30]  Fucking assholes.  And he knew exactly what we were all about.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Cock sucking.  Exactly.  Yeah, he was a lunatic.  As I said last week, a creative culture must be built on a foundation of respect.  No, it isn't.  Based on respect.  Oh, wow.  Randy Michaels said that.  The creative culture is based on anarchy, no respect, no fucking thinking of anyone's  feelings, who you're going to hurt.  Whether you use it or not is a different story.  Wow.  But the creativity itself is based on thinking of anything. 
[00:43:00]  We're fucked because Randy Michaels is one of those rebels.  He slept next to the bean pod.  He slept next to the PC bean pod.  It's all over.  There's a few people around here I would expect them to say something like that.  Yeah, but not like a Randy Michaels, who's been an edgy fucking management guy forever.  He's dead to me.  Do you think he made the statement or do you think he was just a lawyer?  A lawyer.  As I said last week, a creative culture must be built on a foundation of respect. 
[00:43:30]  Really?  No.  Really?  Foundation of respect?  No.  That's not creativity.  Wow.  That is a fucked up statement.  Look at like most of the great songs are very creative and they offend someone.  Of course.  You know, I mean, creativity is based in mutual respect.  Respect?  Like piss Christ?  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Like fucking Carlin's Seven Dirty Words?  Yeah, exactly.  Like pretty much any good stand-up act is creative and based not on respect. 
[00:44:00]  No respect whatsoever.  That's for sure.  Creativity is based in what you think and feel and you expressing that.  And you're not supposed to have, I guess you have to have a certain amount of regard, like  you have to be aware that other people are going to be affected by it.  Oh, absolutely.  But it is not based in mutual respect.  No.  That's a dumb fucking statement.  Wow.  We're going to play the piece that is pretty much getting Lee Abrams, our friend, fired.  Michael said that, Randy Michael said that referring to an October 5th note sent to employees 
[00:44:30]  ahead of the New York Times piece.  So Randy Michael's believed in old school creativity, absolutely.  Before the scandal.  And then he realized, holy shit, this New York Times article is coming out.  I got to change gears immediately.  And then on top of that, soon after that, then Lee Abrams sent this out.  He got retroactively fucked.  Yeah, no kidding.  Our culture's not about being offensive, excuse me, or hurtful.  That's not Randy Michael's.  Wow, that's a lawyer. 
[00:45:00]  This is a guy trying to save his job, too.  Randy Michael's is tied up in a closet somewhere and a lawyer wrote that.  Has to be.  But by the way, I always respected Randy Michael's because he was taking chances all the fucking time.  Offensive is a changing thing.  It's like, it's completely subjective.  Of course it is.  A lot of people think interracial relationships or gay matters.  There's a commercial out now for a fucking, not rock band.  What's the rock band one for the fucking? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, the DJ.  Yeah, yeah, DJ Hero.  There's a commercial out for that that I have just giant problems with.  We'll talk about that.  Whatever.  No, we won't.  But if you've seen it, you know what it is.  We can talk about it.  We're very upset about that one.  We're still able to talk about shit.  Right.  What's offensive changes, though.  You can't base your creativity on what's offensive.  Of course not.  That's silly.  This is, and to hear from Randy Michaels, I got to stress this, is really bothersome because he was, he was one of those guys in the forefront of like, fuck what's going on in the corporate world. 
[00:46:00]  Fuck what's going on in radio.  You know, we got to fight for this shit.  And he has now given up the battle.  This is bad news, man.  Our culture is not about being offensive, offensive or hurtful.  We encourage employees.  You don't encourage employees ever.  What are they encouraging them to do that they're not encouraging them to do?  We encourage employees to speak up when, oh, okay, when they see or hear something that they find offensive, as a number of employees did with regard to this particular email.  I can assure you, you will be heard. 
[00:46:30]  Of course.  This guy has a gun to his head.  Human resources and creativity and funny never go together.  By the way, if I ever have to meet with human resources, that's the day I walk out.  I am not going to fucking, I'm not going to fucking placate to those people ever.  I will never take a meeting with them.  I'd rather walk.  It's every kid that sat in the front of the bus and got made fun of getting their fucking revenge in adulthood. 
[00:47:00]  That's all, it's these unfun people.  Wow.  Yep.  None of them, I've never met anybody who subscribes to that thinking who had an ounce of fucking funny in them.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Who had a funny or creative or interesting thing to say.  You're absolutely right.  They're just robotic pussies.  Let me see what else we got in this article.  All right, Zell's management team.  Zell!  Zell!  Zavite Angel gets there and gets 10% when he doesn't perform.  Zavite Angel gets a sweet. 
[00:47:30]  Zavite Angel gets points on the back end.  Zell's agent.  Zell has an agent.  He sure does.  Zavite Angel will eat as many diamonds as he wants with a 10 minute break in between.  Sam Zell's a billionaire.  Is he?  But Tribune is in bankruptcy, I guess.  Zell gets a new coffee cup to put his diamonds in. 
[00:48:00]  Zell's agent doesn't take any shit.  No.  Michael's a former radio executive.  And Abrams, a longtime radio industry consultant, joined the company in March 2008.  Abrams, in his Tuesday apology.  I got the whole apology.  You want to hear it?  A whole did it?  I got the whole apology.  Oh.  This is what Lee said.  Should we play the piece first now?  Yeah, we should probably play the piece before the apology.  All right.  Let's go chronological.  This is our old pal Lee Abrams. 
[00:48:30]  So this is what he sent to pretty much the entire company.  This is from The Onion.  Yeah.  And it's a fake news thing that they do.  They have a video newscast that The Onion does.  It looks pretty real.  Impeccably like the news.  Yeah.  Very dry reporters and everything.  And I think this plays well on radio.  Yeah.  They're reporting on a little VH1 accident.  Obviously scantily clad women.  Picture like Rock of Love. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's every whore you've seen on every reality show.  Right.  Making out, doing horrible things to each other.  Right.  And it's done in a camera style if a news crew was on location of an accident.  Flavor Flav.  Yeah.  With all those whores.  Whores.  This is hilarious that he sent this to everybody.  God bless him.  Maybe he just wanted to retire.  That might be true.  Great way to go off somewhere.  All right.  Hit it.  We'll be right back. 
[00:49:30]  Let's go live to Onion News Network's Brian Scott, who's live on the scene. 
[00:50:00]  Brian, what's exactly going on out there?  Well, it's just horrible, Anna.  The highway here was not pristine to begin with, but now it's covered in all of this orange-skinned slut.  I've only been here an hour.  I've already seen four three-way kisses and six tattoos with misspellings.  And downwind, the stench of perfume and tequila mixed together is pretty difficult to stomach.  Well, it sounds like quite a scene.  Brian, I understand that the sluts had been loaded onto the bus in Huntington Beach early  this morning.  Is that right?  That's where it began.  Yes.  The sluts were being transported from a negligee-wearing rock climbing contest there to a girl-on-girl 
[00:50:30]  paintball match when the crash occurred.  There's been speculation, in fact.  The accident was actually caused by some slut leaking into the front cab on the vehicle  and getting on the driver.  Now, the local fire department is just not equipped to handle something this toxic.  The problem is that we're very close to the San Gabriel River, and officials are concerned  that the sluts might go skinny-dipping in it or think it's a hot tub and make out in it.  Oh, my gosh, yeah.  But we should say, too, that the crews, they're doing their best.  They're just trying to keep these sluts contained with impromptu strip-offs and shooter contests 
[00:51:00]  in the ditch finally.  Now, we've just gotten word that VH1 has issued a statement.  It's on their website.  It says they are fully committed to the safe handling of sluts.  Yes, but the EPA has urged VH1 to use perhaps a more diluted form of slut than this highly  concentrated slut they use now.  Yeah, it all sounds like good stuff, but I don't think VH1's going to ever go for that.  Ryan, stay safe out there, and don't fuck any of those sluts.  All right, thanks, Anna.  Moving on, a new Apple laptop will become preloaded with a half-written coming-of-age novel.  It's pretty funny. 
[00:51:30]  It's done very well.  Lee Abrams thought he found something funny, and being a creative guy, I said, I've got to share this.  Why would you send that out, though, in a corporation with this fucking broad?  I know, right?  I guarantee you it was not some straight guy who complained about that.  It was a fucking broad.  And she probably complained anonymously.  None of them just come out and go, look, I don't like that.  They all just cower and fucking send emails to the boss.  I ain't really care for that.  They never want to confront the person and go, that was rude. 
[00:52:00]  And then this thing.  Do you think it's a good idea to have somebody working here that would think this is appropriate?  Like putting a question to the boss.  Is it appropriate?  Is that appropriate?  And then the boss has to write back, well, we're so sorry.  Yeah, but what's mind-boggling, then the boss takes that one person way more seriously than the other.  Than everyone else that just watched it laugh.  Or just deleted it or just have fucked it.  Or moved on with their day without even thinking twice about it.  Put it in their spam folder immediately. 
[00:52:30]  Why are we catering to the minority in the workplace?  Why are we catering to the minority everywhere?  I'll tell you why.  Lawsuits.  It's all law.  They're all afraid of being sued for a sexually aggressive work environment or a harassing work environment.  It's all these fucking twat lawyers that have your employees sign something.  Then you might see some shit while you're working at this company.  You can't sign away your civil rights.  You can't sign away your civil rights.  And that's why when they first started bringing bitches into the workplace, fucking bitches into the workplace, 
[00:53:00]  that couldn't fucking hack the male social club that was going on back in the days of, like, fucking bewitched.  When, you know, hey, make me a double, bitch.  The boss is coming over.  Larry Tate's coming over.  Make us drinks.  Right.  Like, they couldn't handle that type of workplace.  They had to change everything.  No more jokes.  No more bullshit.  If you want to enter the man's workplace, then you entered the man's workplace. 
[00:53:30]  That's what happened.  Sorry.  I feel bad for people because we're still relatively safe here.  But, man, the workplace has become just a bore to be at.  I don't know how you got to walk on eggshells on fucking ovary shells.  I don't know how they're doing it.  So Lee sends that out.  Pretty funny piece.  I mean, there was one shot of a woman completely topless for maybe two seconds.  And the rest were just scantily clad.  And the word slut was used a lot, obviously. 
[00:54:00]  So Lee sent this out to everybody.  A tribune all.  Wow.  Two tribune all from Lee Abrams.  Subject, my apologies in capital letters.  The janitor got this.  Yeah.  Shit.  By the way, he doesn't believe what he wrote here.  But you got to do what you got to do.  Sure.  We've been in this situation where we've read fake apologies.  Yeah.  That someone else wrote for us.  Of course.  I would like to take this opportunity to personally apologize to everyone who was offended by one of the videos in yesterday's think piece. 
[00:54:30]  So that's what he was doing at XM, too.  He would send stuff out just to get your creative juices going.  You know what I mean?  I wouldn't know.  I'd just put them right in my spam folder.  I never read an email from that blithering idiot.  He had some good stuff, man.  I wouldn't know.  He had some good stuff.  L.A. Abrams.  Zoom spam.  He was in with the Viagra fucking things.  He sure was.  And the Russian letters and the fucking S.  Nigerian fucking $10 million offers. 
[00:55:00]  And Lee.  Walter knew a guy that got fired for brushing into a girl's ass by accident.  With his cock, though.  His face was hard.  He was out.  Leaking.  There was a cum involved.  So, yeah.  Video in yesterday's think piece.  So he's still doing that creative meeting stuff and sending out stuff to get people thinking.  And he got fucked.  I think that was his whole job over there, too.  What was his title? 
[00:55:30]  Innovative fucking motherfucker.  Innovation officer.  That's a scary title to have.  How dumb title is that?  It stinks.  It's a scary title to have because you're going to be shoving some stuff out there.  Sounds like something Hitler makes you.  Yes.  You are the innovation officer, and then you've got to figure out how to kill more, you know, them.  It was poor judgment on my part, and I'm sorry.  At the initial creative meeting for our new morning program, we showed 13 videos, some of which we liked and some of which we didn't like, to help demonstrate the concept for the program. 
[00:56:00]  I don't know what program.  Wait, oh, well, am I wrong?  What is the Tribune?  It's a newspaper?  It's, uh, well, it's more than that now, right?  Yeah, it's like, uh, they have newspapers and radios.  Do they have radio stations?  I don't know.  I know they've expanded.  Our new morning show.  What's that mean?  I don't know.  Maybe we should find out because the Tribune is obviously a big newspaper, but I think this is all-encompassing now.  They're doing a lot more than just newspapers.  You think he worked for the, like, maybe he was doing something with the radio division and sent this out to everybody?  If they have that, I don't even know, Jimmy. 
[00:56:30]  I'm scared.  I don't like not knowing.  New morning show.  What is that?  Is it an internet morning show they're doing?  They own WGN.  Okay.  They used to own the Cubs.  They own the Chicago Tribune.  What's the new morning show?  Someone in Chicago is going to help us out.  What's the new morning show that he's talking about?  Concept for the, to help demonstrate the concept for the program.  Uh, we used old Cornette films as well as some motivational and social media videos.  Included were a few videos from The Onion, which uses satire to call out the silliness of some TV shows. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  The video in Bad Taste was a parody of a cable-type reality show.  It is not something that we would ever air on our TV stations.  Okay, so the old TV stations.  You gotta tell people that?  Yeah, isn't this disgusting?  In fact, quite the opposite.  We show this as an example of what not to do.  Well, now he's trying to save his ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't blame him.  That's sweetie.  Uh, but still, I understand that it was very inappropriate to distribute a link to the video to a wider audience.  Jesus. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, poor Lee.  And I've asked our technology department to delete the email from our servers.  Again, I'm sorry for offending anyone, and I promise to make sure that my future emails contain nothing like this video ever again.  Oh, don't worry.  They won't.  Sign Lee.  And that should be good enough, by the way.  That should be enough.  He's saying he's sorry.  But another guy will lose his job.  Another creative, smart guy will lose his job over this.  There's no way they allow this to just be the end of it.  Unfortunately.  Unfortunately.  Uncreative douchebags all over the place.  Let's see.  What fucking woman or soft male who wants his job? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  You know, I just don't think that's appropriate.  I mean, I just don't think that that's...  In the workplace, uh...  Oh, now this...  I have to address this.  Shit.  All right.  Workplace.  Mechanics can't put pictures of fucking, uh...  A Playboy, like a centerfold or something in their toolbox anymore.  You know what it is now?  Because some dumb bitch will come up to get her car fixed and see a fucking nude body that looks eight billion times better than her fat fucking ass.  So she's got to complain?  You know what they're... 
[00:58:30]  Fuck you!  You know what they're distributing now?  What?  Hot girls, but they're properly dressed.  Oh, is that what it is?  A few people online saying that.  That's what you want to see, too.  Yeah, it's cool.  Properly dressed instead of the bikini, uh, you know, pictures.  Yeah, hot girl in a fucking business suit to remind you of the lawyer that you hate.  That's good.  Chicago Tribune editor, uh...  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Gerald Kern said in a Tuesday interview that he thought it was offensive and completely inappropriate to be sent out in a workplace setting to everyone in this company.  Workplace.  I hate the workplace.  Monday's company-wide note was the latest delivery of Abrams' weekly impressionistic, uh, I don't know this word, P-A-S-T-I-C-H-E, pastiche? 
[00:59:00]  Uh, P-A-S-T-I-C-H-E.  I don't know that word.  Oh, column?  Of ideas, very good.  Observations and links to outside sources from Abrams aimed at encouraging employees to rethink media and its conventions.  That's his whole job.  He sends a lot of shit at you, and you look at this, and maybe you get inspired a little bit. 
[00:59:30]  Maybe you like it, maybe you don't.  Maybe, yeah, you're inspired, you're not.  Since joining Tribune, Abrams has advocated redesign of the company's newspapers and overhaul of many of its TV stations' newscasts, including pushing for development of an anchor-less newscast in Houston.  That was his idea.  I heard about that.  By the way, I just, I figured I'd fill everyone in, because I just, I knew this, but I didn't want to seem smart.  But, uh, pastiche is a literary or some other artistic genre that's like a hodgepodge or an imitation. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, thanks, Ant.  Yeah, no problem.  No problem.  Cool.  Uh, here's Scrambler from Chicago.  Why would I have 3G service?  Scrambler.  Uh, Scrambler.  Hey, Opa, I tweeted that to you yesterday.  Anyway, um, the Tribune also has a, uh, they have an AM radio station that has, uh, shows on it all day long.  It was the, it was the station that Paul Harvey actually broadcast from, uh, that was syndicated out.  So they, they have, they're like the biggest AM station in Chicago as well, and they have shows all day long. 
[01:00:30]  See, Lee was just continuing doing what he did on satellite radio and what he did with his radio career.  And he got caught.  Unfortunately, he's in a company now that's a bit more stuffy.  He got caught being fun and creative.  Right.  Ouch.  That'll hurt.  But you know what?  If, if this, uh, email went around SiriusXM, somebody would be in deep shit, too.  Oh, my God.  They would be in deep shit as well.  We're, we're not too far behind the, the, the Tribunes out there, Anthony.  No.  Uh, should we continue with this? 
[01:01:00]  So the editors, Med, uh, since joining, uh, Tribune, Abrams has advocated, redesigned the company's newspapers.  Okay, yeah.  We're out to bust the TV, TV cliches.  He wants to fucking reinvent shit.  Yeah.  That's, he's always been about that.  Yay.  Uh, Abrams said in a June interview with, uh, Chicago, with the Chicago Tribune, if you  ever, if you ever watch Onion TV, they mock it and they're right.  Some of this stuff is hilariously out of date and we've got to attack.  Some of these cliches are beyond belief.  Mm-hmm.  So, you know how we make fun of the local news? 
[01:01:30]  Yes.  Lee is right there with us by our side, but he not only just makes fun of it, he's really  trying to do something about it and make it something new and exciting.  So if they fire him, they're just stupid.  They are dumb.  Because then it's just going to continue with the, the bullshit that we're all making  fun of.  Unbelievable.  He's a guy, Lee's trying to change it.  Abrams said Tuesday he had asked Tribune Company to delete the offending email from its  servers.  Okay, we did that.  Uh, video is in bad taste.  We did that.  Uh.  Lee is a queer.  We did that.  We did that. 
[01:02:00]  A dunderhead.  Yeah.  Lee has a bad mustache.  Looks like Wilford Brimley.  We did that.  Lee smokes pot.  We did that.  He does smoke pot.  Jesus.  Lee's a worse pilot than Mohammed Atta.  We did that.  We did that.  We had a horrible judgment on sending videos.  But it's like he's a creative, funny guy.  And even musically, Lee fucking hated the status quo.  Yeah.  He always wanted something different.  He's what happens when you're a creative guy in that shit environment.  Poor Lee.  To have to deal with the, at least we're able to say what we want to say. 
[01:02:30]  Dinosaur.  To have to be a creative guy among these fucking cunts.  Poor Lee got caught in the tar pit.  Just a fucking dinosaur in the tar pit of what is entertainment these days.  But he's in a corporate world.  It's much harder there.  He had his own, yeah.  He had his own bit for Tribune called Skydives, where he goes to restaurants.  He flies to restaurants and then he, you know, goes into a dive.  Then he does a little review of skydives.  That's interesting.  But he takes his plane to these restaurants all over the country. 
[01:03:00]  That's pretty good.  And then he writes about it or blogs.  I don't know how he gets it out there.  But here's the back story on Lee.  And we're almost done.  Abrams, 58, came to Tribune after a decade with XM Satellite Radio, which has merged with former rival Sirius, which he served as chief creative officer.  One of the founding fathers of radio research and for years among the industry's most influential, Abrams previously had more than 300 station clients taking their cues from him.  He's been widely credited with developing FM's album-oriented rock. 
[01:03:30]  That's who we get to blame for that, by the way.  Format and widely blamed for stifling free-form progressive rock on FM.  Wow.  So as creative as he was, he also fucked radio a little bit for us.  Abrams got a start young, a 1967 Chicago Tribune story when he was a 15-year-old sophomore.  Noted he already had been in business for three years selling promotional ideas to radio stations.  Is that what they called drugs back then?  Promotional ideas?  And he also launched his own record label when he was just a youngster. 
[01:04:00]  And now he's going to lose his fucking career over this.  Yeah.  He'll get something else.  He's a very creative dude, man.  Yeah.  But you can't be creative with those...  It's amazing that those fucking...  We'll see what happens.  Maybe they just give the same line that maybe they keep them.  Either that or he'll fly his plane into the Tribune building.  Fucking...  What a great way to go out of it.  Actually, he just loses his mind.  That's an inappropriate...  Rumpf, rumpf, rumpf, rumpf, rumpf.  Let me say to James, James, you know Randy Michaels? 
[01:04:30]  I love Randy Michaels, dude.  And it kills me to hear him talking like this.  Why do you love Randy Michaels?  He's a legend in the radio business, that's for sure.  Dude, the first company I worked for was J-Core, which Randy was the end-all.  Yes, J-Core.  Now, J-Core became clear, child.  I'm just trying to help people out.  When he was running J-Core, you want to explain to people what he was doing?  He was out of his mind with the formats he was creating and everything.  Well, not only that, but the first thing...  Dude, I was 18 years old when I started on the radio.  They handed me a piece of paper and he said this... 
[01:05:00]  Well, he didn't, but this is the company handbook.  And it just said, use your best judgment, thanks, Randy.  That was the whole company handbook.  Yeah, there's now big, huge, fucking thick company handbooks.  Mm-hmm.  This is a guy who drove his SUV into the lobby of hotels, got out, threw the keys up against  the J-Core here.  This guy's a nut job.  He is a nut job, but it looks like he's been stifled, too, at Tribune.  It's sad.  It is sad, right?  When he met Ant and I, he was trying to hire us, and he... 
[01:05:30]  I mean, he's a big, huge executive worth fucking millions, and he got on his knees and kissed  me and Anthony's ring finger.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, he's out of his fucking mind.  Watch your guys.  We probably should have taken the deal back then.  Ah.  You know, hindsight is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I don't understand that.  Hindsight is 202-0.  Yeah.  Hindsight.  He said 20-20.  Yeah, he wanted to pop us on Q104 at the time and go head-to-head with Howard. 
[01:06:00]  And then the company, what did they do?  I think they...  Then the company put us in a mineshaft for 10 days, and we got really weak, and we finally  said, all right, we'll re-sign.  No, it's because, yeah...  Remember the five-hour meeting, because they knew we were gone?  Yeah, Infinity.  Yeah, we were going to sign with them, and they were going to put us on in mornings.  Next thing you know, we're in a...  For real, we were in a conference room for hours.  They just fucking wore us out.  And they just threw, like, fucking everything at us.  Yeah, they said...  Here you go. 
[01:06:30]  Take this.  We got this.  You got this.  All right.  And then we had to tell Randy that we're not...  Yeah.  Sometimes...  But then he fucking left, too.  Sometimes I wonder.  Sometimes I wonder.  But then he got fucked.  But then again, Clear Channel turned out to be what it became, so you're right.  They're even tougher.  Piece of shit.  And fuck it.  Yeah, everything just went to fuck.  We got Fareed sitting in front of us.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  And then Mel came out of the secret door.  Yeah.  They had secret doors back then.  Do you hear about that whole thing with fucking Citadel and Fareed?  What? 
[01:07:00]  Oh, the stockholders are so fucking pissed.  All those executives...  We're stockholders.  I know.  Yeah.  Well, I don't even consider myself a stockholder.  No, we're those guys.  I need stock.  We didn't buy just a little bit.  We're one of the big investors over there.  They're emerging from bankruptcy.  All right.  What do we get out of that?  That's what they're doing right now.  Do we get anything out of that?  What do we get?  Yeah.  I don't know what we got, but the executives got upwards of tens of millions of dollars  of the money in the restructuring of the company.  No, I know what's going on around here, but what's happening with...  Oh, no, no.  What?  I'm talking about Citadel. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  Oh, Citadel.  Stockholders are fucking fuming.  So wait, so Fareed and those guys are all going to get like a lot of...  Oh, yeah.  They all got millions of dollars.  They are all the...  Dude, when it comes to the executives, they're all the same.  Yes.  Yes.  They're all Enron.  They're all fucking Tycho.  They're all the same motherfuckers.  It's one piece of shit who changes his tie a lot.  Yes.  What fucking...  What dirtbags. 
[01:08:00]  Abominable.  Wow.  Greedy motherfuckers, man.  And our hundred and...  What was it?  $10,000 investment is now worth a couple hundred bucks.  If that.  And he's getting raises still.  But do you guys lose...  I don't even think so.  I think we lost it all.  You lose it when they go bankrupt.  Oh, yeah.  We're done now.  And when they come back, the executives get money and they owe you nothing.  We get nothing.  We lost everything in the bankruptcy.  So, we just threw $110,000 away.  Who throws $110,000 away?  So, they will take...  They will restructure by giving the executives millions of dollars and then come out of bankruptcy, 
[01:08:30]  put out an IPO, which, God, I hope I get in on.  Oh, I want to get in on this one.  Put out an IPO, raise more money, so they can fuck over a whole new batch of assholes.  So, the same fucking pieces of shit that fuck a company up, they're still there.  Yeah.  They're still there.  Are rewarded by getting money?  You blew it!  Isn't that amazing?  So, why don't we go back in?  Why don't we get...  I think it's a good one.  Let's go back in.  I'm shorting the fuck out of that company this time. 
[01:09:00]  I'm shorting the fuck out of Citadel this time.  Fuck them.  That's in my humble opinion.  You know, I...  I just want to say that.  I don't hold any Citadel.  I hold only $100,000 worth.  That's worth shit.  I went bankrupt.  You know he got remarried?  Did he?  I saw one of his right-hand men at...  I was flying somewhere, and all of a sudden, one of Fareed's guys, who's a huge fan of  ours, remember the computer guy?  Oh, yeah, okay.  You know who I'm talking about?  Yeah, I know that guy.  He...  I go, wow, what are you doing in the airport? 
[01:09:30]  He goes, oh, you can't tell anyone, but I'm flying.  I'm flying to wherever for Fareed's wedding.  Never learned.  And you thought I married fucking young.  Oh, really?  Holy shit.  Fareed's wife, that first one, was one of the best times I ever had in my life at a party.  Oh, no, I'm not shushing.  That was brilliant.  Yeah, you want to go all in on this one?  Is it Mel's birthday party?  You want to go all in on this?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What, are you crazy?  Why?  You think I'm nuts?  Why not?  It's something that happened. 
[01:10:00]  It was a party.  You're crazy.  Even I'm saying you're crazy.  Fareed's ex-wife?  Let's put it this way.  Let's say the three of us are out.  And me and me, we're all talking, and we're bad-mouthing Sam.  Yeah.  Let's say we're bad-mouthing Sam.  So you're talking any day we're out?  He doesn't.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, Sam.  Look, Sam doesn't know we're bad-mouthing him.  So let's say that we go on the air and go, remember that time the guy who doesn't work  with any more bad-mouthing Sam?  Yeah.  We're still letting the whole country know that somebody was bad-mouthing Sam. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  Let me explain to the listeners.  I carpet bomb every day, and I'm sniping every day.  I'm an asshole.  I'll be the first to admit.  We'll be right back after this.  But you're looking at the true Adam bomb.  Anthony's the true Adam bomb of the two of us, by the way.  You really are.  Yeah, but you need two keys to set me off.  You really are.  And hit the buttons and launch codes.  I'm an asshole.  Carpet bombing, getting very close all the time to something marine.  You're a rogue, ruining everything.  But you, in the end, are the Adam bomb, sir. 
[01:11:00]  I'll tell you right now.  Because you're about to say something that would be so fucking bad.  I swear to you.  And it's coming from me.  I never would have used names.  Oh, you wouldn't?  Oh, okay.  No, I wasn't really going to do that.  I understand that's fucking crazy.  Now I say do it.  This is a great story, man.  It is one of the best stories.  Well, she was Dean Warmer's fucking...  She was the epitome of Dean Warmer's wife in Animal House.  Sorry. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Perfect, perfect imitation.  She was hammered that day.  Remember her bad breath, alcohol breath?  She had champagne, puke breath.  She was...  Oh, wow.  She was...  I liked her, actually.  I really did.  But she was out of her mind.  And she was literally inches from her face...  Inches away.  ...talking to us.  And she'd put on this drunken voice trying to be sultry.  Like she was the cougar of the day.  You know?  The cougar.  Was she pretty?  She was...  She was all right. 
[01:12:00]  She was past her prime.  That's not sure.  She was all right.  She was all drunk.  So she was just like...  She'd lean into me and like fall into me.  And be like...  You know...  Let me tell you about...  And then she'd go off on high-level people and their spouses and relatives and whatnot.  Because she knew what was going on.  Because Fareed, I guess, would come home and tell her.  Well, he was one of the main guys. 
[01:12:30]  He was one of the big inside guys.  When we were at NAW.  Let me tell you what kind of a cunt she is.  This one's a fucking piece of shit.  That fuck...  And she's getting loud because it's a party and she's drunk.  And we're like, shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to shuffle myself away from her because I don't want to be caught in the fucking...  The ring of doom if somebody...  She overhears it.  He overhears it.  She used the word pussy whipped.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Cut to the chase.  Well, this one's a cunt. 
[01:13:00]  That one is the most pussy whipped motherfucker you're ever going to see.  And it's all people we knew very well.  All high-level motherfuckers.  And it was like, oh, Jesus Christ.  It was so uncomfortable.  Yeah, because it was at Mel's birthday party.  So it's like every high-level GM was there.  Was that Mel's birthday or was that Fareed's retirement?  It was Fareed's retirement.  Sorry, sorry.  You're right.  You're right.  Why would we be invited to that?  I was at that party.  It was a retirement.  That's when I introduced myself to Mel as he was leaving.  I was like, hi, I'm Jim Norton. 
[01:13:30]  And he shook my hand.  I'm like, I'm on the Opie and Anthony show.  And he went, tell those guys I said hi.  And he just left.  That was it.  That's Mel.  And then I was telling you guys, yeah, I was talking to Mel.  That's Mel.  Retirement party.  That's right.  So everyone was there.  All the general managers and shit from all of infinity.  And she was going off.  Oh, and I just wanted to get away.  Like, I didn't want anyone overhearing her telling me that shit.  Because that would have been my fucking neck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God. 
[01:14:00]  Funny as fuck, though.  All right.  You were smart.  I thought you were really going to use names.  No, like I said, I do have a lot of atom bombs.  But it does this quite the protocol for launch sequence.  Unlike the rogue submarine fucking captain that you are off the coast of some country just going, fuck it.  Right.  Takes a lot to scare me.  And you did a little bit today.  Why don't we take a break here?  Yes, I got a sandwich that's cold.  We got a little Lee Abrams we're going to play in the break.  Thumbs up on that.  Good.  When we get back.  It's okay, Kenny.  It's okay. 
[01:14:30]  I like my sandwich cold.  Everyone is talking about South Park.  Yes.  Yesterday's episode was a holy shit South Park episode.  Yeah, it was a good one.  We'll play a couple of clips, a couple of highlights from that in case you missed it and talk about that.  And a lot of people tweeted me yesterday saying congratulations to the show because they think that we made Perez Hilton stop his cum bubbling.  Yeah.  There were other people on it, but what would Tyler Durden do?  Picked up our part of it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:15:00]  Which is a huge fucking website that competes kind of with the Perez Hilton thing.  We did give him a savage.  I will say this.  We gave Perez Hilton a savage beating.  Yeah, and it was all justified.  For being a hypocrite, by the way.  I don't give a shit if he wants to draw cum bubbles and cocks.  I don't care.  But then you can't go and say that cyberbullying is wrong.  That was our whole point.  Because we certainly cyber bully and have fun with all that.  Yeah, we love it.  But at least we admit it and we know who we are.  That's right.  We out each other.  All right, more whatever. 
[01:15:30]  Sirius XM, the virus.  This is the OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Show.  Yeah, rock.  I want to thank Jordan from Scranton, PA, for being a tattletale.  Thank you, Jordan.  We need the tattletales out there.  Who's tattling?  Yeah, he writes, did they take the eat shit out of Dr. Steve's promo? 
[01:16:00]  And then he just writes, WTF, question mark.  That's what the fuck in cyberspeak.  That's right.  Yes.  Why would they take that out of the promo?  I hope they didn't and it was some sort of an error.  And if they're doing that, why aren't they telling us?  You don't know more than us, so stop it.  You could suggest things and then the power of our brains will decide if we want to do  that.  Who took it out, though?  Don't live it up to the power of that. 
[01:16:30]  Who takes it out?  E-Rock?  I don't know.  We're trying to find out.  E-Rock, do you know anything yet?  What I'm finding out now is that this is a different promo.  The original one had the eat shit.  This is a newer one.  This is promoting his Saturday live show, not the What the Hell is That.  It's still on the end of the what the hell is.  Hold on a minute, though.  Now, obviously, Jordan's wrong, but I wasn't going to just take Jordan's word for it.  Of course.  I go, E-Rock.  Investigate.  Investigate.  And didn't he come back and go, yeah, they took that out? 
[01:17:00]  That's right.  So now I put the blame on you, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  You did say that?  Well, with the amount of time I had running in between the studio and everything.  Go away!  It was a timing issue.  It was our fault.  I just got to the end of his promo.  I thought that's why.  All right, Colum Blow.  Colum Blow.  Colum Blow.  I hate to bother you.  I believe there was an eat shit at the end of that.  Can I have a sandwich? 
[01:17:30]  I'm hungry.  McClod.  Shit.  McClod.  McMillan and Sandwich.  Cagney and Fat Facey.  He's not even smiling.  I should know he's not happy.  Oh, no.  He's looking down slightly. 
[01:18:00]  He's not very happy.  And I got to now apologize to those guys down the hall.  Oh, no, no, no.  I hate when I have to apologize.  I'm sorry I questioned that you guys might have did something.  Starsky on lunch.  That's a good one.  I don't have to apologize.  E-Rock should apologize.  What?  E-Rock should apologize.  I feel like E-Rock should apologize.  To me, right?  To you and to management.  Yeah, E-Rock, you put me in a bad spot.  You did, E-Rock.  I was just beating those guys up, and it turns out they didn't do nothing wrong this time. 
[01:18:30]  Well, then I apologize.  All right.  We can move on now.  And South Park.  My wheels are turning.  Starsky and lunch.  I'm trying to think of old 70s shows.  I know.  Jake and the E-Rock.  Remember that show?  I do.  Jake and the Fat Man.  That's one steak and the Fat Man. 
[01:19:00]  BJ and the Bear Claw.  Did he fight crime?  I don't know.  That's great.  South Park.  Oh.  Making fun of Jersey Shore.  Yeah.  These fucking guys know what they're doing.  Detective shows dummies.  Can't put pork in Mindy.  Pork and Mindy.  BJ and the Elephant.  Sorry.  Yeah.  This South Park last night.  Holy shit.  How are they getting away with this? 
[01:19:30]  What channel is this on?  Comedy Central.  Can't be Comedy Central.  Oh, Comedy Central.  Because they edit the shit out of our comedian friends all the time.  But if you're a cartoon, is that what the deal is?  We've brought this up, right?  Cartoon, you get away with murder.  South Park is past realistic comedians can't do it, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  South Park's kind of past doing anything that'll get them in trouble, no matter what it is.  They could get in trouble with, like, Islam.  Because they hung in there.  You just gotta hang in there.  Yeah.  And you'll win the battles in the end, but most people don't understand that. 
[01:20:00]  I don't know why.  You know?  Yeah.  I'm sure when they get complaint letters, they just fucking put them in the shredders.  They don't plenticate to the complainer, do they?  They know that South Park's a big moneymaker, so they give them a little latitude.  They used to be big moneymakers, too.  They did a nigger episode right after Michael Richards.  Yes.  It was brilliant.  Yeah, that's what they do, too.  They take the subjects that are, like, really sensitive at the time, and they just throw it right on. 
[01:20:30]  And they skew it.  Oh, no, no, no.  Because to be creative, it should be based in mutual respect.  Yes.  That's why it's such purely what comedy should be.  I think.  You know, it's brutal.  I can't.  What?  Hawaii 5-0-inch waist.  50 inches.  And then they showed the wave he made when he jumped in the pool.  Yeah, and the Hawaiians are surfing on it, of course. 
[01:21:00]  You're wrong.  Are you going to defend yourself or what?  Hawaii 5-0-inch waistline.  I didn't think I was allowed to.  5-0-inch waistline.  You're not allowed to defend yourself.  What's wrong with you?  Because then it ruins the bit.  What bit?  What bit?  This isn't even a bit.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, see, they are able to get away with things because it's just South Park.  They've been around for years.  They're an institution.  Do we explain the episode or do we play the clips? 
[01:21:30]  Because what they did, a Snooki, is just awesome.  I tried to build a narrative with the clips.  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  All right, so we'll just comment.  Let's see how well you did.  I always try to build a narrative.  A narrative building is normally shit.  Oh, man.  Where can you get good clothes in this town?  Nowhere.  I mean, that's why.  Yeah, those are the new neighbors come over to Stan's house for dinner,  and you can just imagine who they are.  Jersey people.  Is this Snooki right here?  No, this is, what's her name? 
[01:22:00]  Danielle Staub's rival from Real Housewives of New Jersey.  Teresa?  Yes, Teresa.  They didn't just skewer Jersey Shore.  They skewered all things Jersey.  So this is Teresa.  Where can you get good clothes in this town?  Nowhere.  I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right?  And the woman that works the hair salon, Julia,  have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?  Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.  Ears out to here.  So I tell her, you got big ears, sweetie.  I'm not trying to be mean.  It's just a Jersey thing. 
[01:22:30]  Why be offended?  I mean, you've got a big chin.  We've all got imperfections.  Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart.  That was totally uncalled for, for what she did.  My eyes are too far apart.  I'm like, who is she?  Is she God?  No.  You don't ever, ever, you whack job, prostitution whore.  You'd probably sell your muff for six dollars.  You fucking psycho bitch. 
[01:23:00]  Fuck you.  You're nothing for garbage.  That's what you want.  You're garbage.  You sick old woman muff garbage.  Muff cabbage.  Fuck this psycho bitch.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  She's a fucking pig.  She's fucking pissing me off.  Okay, I love you.  Take it easy.  I love you.  I thought I was going to deck her.  I was fine.  I was really fine.  I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am.  Like, I could be mad one minute, and then I'll be fine.  Okay, all better. 
[01:23:30]  Just had to get that out.  It's just, it's a Jersey thing.  So, who wants dessert?  Me!  That is a, uh, yes, a Jersey thing.  You know what?  What?  It was much better watching.  I was just about to say the same thing.  Well, cartoons are a visual medium.  You know what?  Yes, yes.  Don't worry.  I'll be able to save this for everybody.  Fontaine in Virginia.  Go ahead.  Hey, I got an E-Rod show for you.  Yeah.  Magnum P-I-G.  Ah, big, big, big.  Oh, boy.  Magnum P-I-E. 
[01:24:00]  P-I-E.  Let's go to Tucker, Wisconsin.  Tucker.  Yeah, book him, Fatso.  Oh, see.  That's a light five-0.  Defend yourself.  I like that one, too.  Russell K. from North Carolina.  Six million calorie man.  Oh, carbo-loading.  Yeah, he was carbo-loading.  Comfort food last night, E-Rod?  No.  There was some.  No, there wasn't.  Some.  What was the one thing you had to eat, even though you probably said to yourself, maybe 
[01:24:30]  I shouldn't be eating this?  Dessert.  I had Pepperidge Farm chocolate chip slash pecan cookies last night.  Pecan.  Pecan.  Pecan.  Pecan.  What was the food last night you couldn't help eating?  Well, there wasn't anything last night.  You can tell us.  Everybody gets a treat.  Yeah, that's all right.  I didn't have one last night.  Do you think Iraq likes treats?  Oh, he loves treats.  He carbo-loads.  Iraq loves indulging.  Whether it's in food or toys at the Comic-Con or whatever it is. 
[01:25:00]  He just, he loves consuming.  Oh, God.  He loves his treats.  He is a great consumer of everything.  Does he feel he, like, deserves a treat?  Is that what it is, Iraq?  You're like, you know what?  I really did good today.  I should have a treat.  I think there's a void in Iraq that he tries to fill with treats and goodies.  Oh.  When you were young and you would do good, what would your reward be? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Like, when you were a boy, and so you'd cut the grass, or when you would do your homework,  what would mother give you as a reward?  Here's a cookie.  I wasn't fat until I started working here.  He's kind of right, by the way.  I saw some old pictures.  I can't believe it's the same guy.  Sorry, Iraq.  Wow.  Yeah.  I was in good shape until maybe 2005.  Well, slow down with the good shape.  Exactly.  You were always skinny fat, but now you're just... 
[01:26:00]  Uh-oh.  Just, um...  Say it.  I'm not going to say it.  There's one.  Chips and dip.  Fat.  Did we get Fat Lock out there yet?  Fat Lock.  Fat Lock.  That's good.  I keep thinking of the Rockford Files, and not one funny thought will come with it.  I know.  Yeah, that's a hard one.  I know.  Do you know what was the music for that? 
[01:26:30]  I didn't know that.  Can you find that real quick?  Not that we're going to watch it, but if we have, if it comes up again.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da.  But how does he know that?  Because I watched TV my whole life.  So did I, but I don't know this shit.  It's all I had.  This was actually played on the radio back then, when the show was on.  And now, the Rockford Files song.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Hello, this is Jim Rockford.  I'm not home right now.  Leave a message.  The Rockford Files.  Yes.  Intro.  All right.  Jersey, is any of these clips worth playing that translate to radio there, Sam?  Because it was a great episode, and we're trying to give the people a taste.  But that first clip sucked a dick.  It could be about his dumps, the rock-hard piles.  Meat shits. 
[01:27:30]  His shits look like the fucking meat in stew.  They have shredded edges.  Four-sided, blocky shits.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Well, the whole gist of the episode was that Jersey, because of all these stupid shows,  is taking over the country.  And started moving west.  And the whole country was becoming New Jersey, up until it hit Colorado and South Park, which 
[01:28:00]  said, it stops here.  You know, everything east of us is now New Jersey.  And everyone's acting like Jersey.  Yeah, they got Denver.  And then they were going to stop him by force.  Right.  With weaponry.  And stuff.  How did they make Snooki again?  Snooki was like Gollum.  Yeah.  A Gollum character.  That would just jump on the men, and just start humping, and trying to fuck them.  I think we got the clip where Snooki rapes Cartman. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Get it off of me!  Get it off of me!  Smush, smush.  We've got to find a way past it.  What does it want?  Sounds like it wants smush, smush.  Smush, smush.  Snooki wants smush, smush.  No!  You guys, it's raping me!  It's raping me!  Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?  Oh, God!  Get out of here!  What? 
[01:29:00]  That's Kyle turning into a Jersey guy.  Get out of here, you piece of garbage!  You want to smush, go creep in somewhere else!  Smush, it's a smush in the teeth!  You're garbage!  You know that?  You're cabbage!  You got cabbage in your mouth!  That's all Snooki said.  You got cabbage in your fucking mouth! 
[01:29:30]  And tried to fuck everything.  And then, yeah, Kyle punched him in the face.  It was just a fuck monster.  A fuck monster, yeah.  That was unintelligible.  And that looked kind of like Gollum.  Was carrying a bottle of booze.  Yeah.  Was dressed scantily clad.  Yeah.  And I think the real kicker, though,  was the fact that they didn't have enough armaments to fend off Jersey.  So they got Al-Qaeda to help them.  And there's a scene where... 
[01:30:00]  Look, I know it's been how many years now?  Nine.  Nine years, but you can't put Al-Qaeda in cartoons yet.  Not even putting Al-Qaeda in cartoons.  What they did, they actually show airliners being flown by Arabs,  crashing into giant groups of people from Jersey,  and just exploding.  And then they pay a tribute to Osama bin Laden. 
[01:30:30]  It's just...  Yeah, this is like Al-Qaeda helping.  It's Al-Qaeda!  We're Al-Qaeda.  Oh, my God.  What balls.  It's great.  This is so fucking ballsy.  Oh, shit.  Good for them.  It's fucking twisted.  Give him out, Al-Qaeda!  Woo-hoo!  Hooray.  How the fuck?  Wow.  Now that's...  On a cold October night, 
[01:31:00]  a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey  and finally said,  Go away!  Our fortitude was the inspiration for others,  and now New Jersey is slowly receding back  to the desolate land from Wincit Cain.  Our country is getting back to normal,  and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden.  Oh, my God.  He's sitting there to kiss him.  Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.  Yeah.  The more distance between me and the others from Jersey,  the better I feel. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, but you still have it in you.  You saved my life, Kyle.  Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.  I just have one question, Kyle.  At Sizzler, when you were yelling muff cabbage,  what's muff cabbage?  It's a...  It's a Jersey thing.  On this day, let us all remember  that no people on this earth are really enemies,  only folks with differences.  So much.  Tank goes down.  We got him!  Tank goes down. 
[01:32:00]  Tank goes down.  Shots have been a lot in the head.  Shoot him in the head.  Holy shit.  That's such great.  They have balls, man.  That's awesome.  The fucking planes flying into the people  and those explosions that they use.  It was like, how much time,  I guess this much time had to go by.  Because if you did that right after,  oh my God, you're done.  Let's see also what...  Yeah, God.  Stupid Governor Christie.  I guarantee you,  someone from Jersey would go,  you know, New Jersey,  and I'll carry...  Please. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, is there a statement out yet?  There will be.  They can't help themselves.  They'll have to get involved.  You know, New Jersey has had a long,  illustrious career  as a great state in this country  of blah, blah.  Shut it.  Wouldn't you once love to see a politician  or somebody,  if someone asks them about it,  go, you know,  it's tasteless.  It's a cartoon comedy show.  What do you expect?  What do you want me to say?  I'm going to comment on it?  Shut up.  Who cares?  You're going to comment on a comedy show?  Comment on a comedy show?  Next question. 
[01:33:00]  Next question, please.  So tomorrow is the big  What the Hell is That show, right?  Holy shit.  Do we have enough people?  Yeah.  We do have enough people.  And some returning favorites.  Oh, really?  No.  Well, we've got to overbook, though,  because do they understand  the overbooking thing yet?  You've got to overbook for these bits  just in case people bail show us a minute.  Well, we're booking as many as we can.  So it's not too late.  If you still have something weird  going on with you  and you want real doctors  checking you out tomorrow, 
[01:33:30]  we want you to come in, right?  We're not capping this bad boy.  No.  Oh, hell's no.  We don't want stuff that is obvious.  We want stuff where  something weird is happening with you  and you don't understand it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not a hangnail.  Stay home.  No, like if you've got two pee holes.  Yeah, we'll lick both of them.  It's like we want people to come to  not just from like fucking Manhattan either.  It's like...  Wherever.  Yeah.  If you're two and a half hours away  and fucking, you know, 
[01:34:00]  Foxwoods Casino.  Right.  Drive down.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  I don't want to talk about my show  tonight or the Saturday show  is sold out.  Who cares?  Nice.  It's not about that.  It's about this bit.  Wow.  It certainly is.  I would love to...  Oh, I'm going to be at Foxwoods.  I just want to say that.  I'm going to be there to see Jimmy.  I have to go there tonight  and come back to tonight.  I know.  Kenny's got to drive you, huh?  I know.  Poor Pat.  He's so dopey.  He has his jacket and jeans,  his driving outfit.  I hate his driving outfit. 
[01:34:30]  By the way,  when you're staying in  wherever they put the help,  you should check out  the Villas at Foxwoods  where I will be staying.  Yes, the Villas.  What the hell is the Villas?  I just punched up a picture of it  last night.  Keith goes,  check out the Villas  at Foxwoods.  He goes,  because that's where we're staying.  I go,  get the fuck out of here.  This is luxury  at its utmost. 
[01:35:00]  Yes, Kenny?  The Villas are two exclusive floors  of the Grand Peckwalk Tower.  Yes.  Look at this room.  Let me see it.  Where are we staying, Kenny?  Are we staying there?  That's not the lobby.  That's my room.  All right.  All right.  Calm down.  Jesus.  And it comes with her.  Yes.  Wow.  What?  She's going to be there.  Do I have a nice room?  Oh.  Did I just see two staircases  in Anthony's room?  Yes.  Why wouldn't I have two staircases?  It's like the Titanic thing.  It does.  It looks like the Titanic. 
[01:35:30]  It's amazing.  Jimmy, you could come up  and say hi.  Yes.  Well, people better hurry up  and buy their tickets  because the Saturday early show  is already sold out.  Done.  Gone.  Yeah.  What about,  what kind of room am I in?  And Anthony will be performing  in the casino.  Yes.  You'll hear me saying,  fuck you,  knock it off,  and how the hell  do they pull this shit  every fucking time?  No.  In Indian casinos,  they like you to say,  ugh.  What?  They're Indians.  I'm saying that  every time you talk. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  You make them bomb them.  What kind of room am I in?  Where's Jimmy's room?  You know,  Foxwoods is a great place.  Oh, no.  That's not a good sign.  You know,  Patrice was there last week,  told me all about it.  Yeah,  said it was good?  Yeah,  he did the grand opening weekend there.  So they must have put him up.  God bless you.  Thank you, Kenny.  In what is called  the finest accommodations,  the villas at Foxwoods.  That must be where  the help stays.  Yeah,  the comedy club  is brand new there.  I hear it's very nice.  Oh, wow. 
[01:36:30]  It's supposed to be very beautiful.  I'm looking forward to seeing it  if I'm not on a roll.  Yeah.  Or if I'm losing.  So either way.  So you're trying to say  they like out-of-control gamblers  a lot more than  people like Jimmy.  Well,  if you own a casino.  Well, yeah,  I understand the casino.  The high rollers  should get the...  Ah.  I don't mind that.  What kind of room am I in?  Just curious.  You're going to mind  when you see  what room you're in.  Yeah,  the kind you put the key  in the door.  But is it a regular room  or is it at least  a nice little suite?  I hope you don't smell  cigarette smoke. 
[01:37:00]  Do I at least have  a nice little suite?  You're not going to mind at all  when you see your room.  Is it a suite?  Does he have a suite?  I got you the best  accommodations I could.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That you open the door  and you can see your bed.  If you can open the door  and see your bed,  you're not in a good room.  Let's go to accommodations,  Cam.  Why don't you show me  which kind of room I'm in?  Oh, no.  I'm curious.  Accommodations.  Here we go.  Okay, the two trees  and the MGM.  Which hotel?  This big gold tower here, 
[01:37:30]  that's the MGM Grand  brand newest tower.  Right, right.  Is that part of Foxwoods?  Yes.  Okay, that's the new tower.  Yeah, that's the latest edition,  MGM Grand at Foxwood.  So is that where I'm staying?  And this thing over here,  that's the Grand Peacock Tower  where Anthony's going to stay.  Oh, yeah.  Which part of that  is he staying in?  Well, where am I staying?  Is he staying at the top  of that castle?  I'm at the top, yeah, yeah.  Of the castle.  I'm very high.  Yeah, the villas are  two luxurious floors  distinguished in the Grand Peacock Tower. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, man.  So where am I staying?  Just curiosity.  Yeah.  Well, if you go to the property map  where you can see  like all the nice restaurants.  Property map?  We're down to the property map.  You're off the front page  of Foxwoods.  Let's see.  It's on the front page  of Foxwoods.  All right, about Foxwoods.  Property map.  Property map down there.  Very good.  Oh, look at that.  There's a whole map of the property  because it's an expansive,  very nice big place.  Wait, where's the MGM?  That's the MGM to the right. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, that's the MGM.  And that's the Peacock Tower.  This is the Grand Peacock Tower.  Now we've got the rest  of the property  in front of us here.  Could you scroll down a little?  Oh, no.  Oh, there goes the MGM  and the Grand Peacock.  They're not even on the page.  It just scrolled off the screen.  Right.  I see a Days Inn.  Here's where the comedy club  is located.  Where is that?  You're pointing at the wrong screen.  Me and Ann can't see.  Well, you've got to do  stereo pointing.  Oh, it's in the...  Yeah.  It's like towards 
[01:39:00]  the bottom left.  Oh, wow.  Bottom left.  That's where the club is.  I mean, they've got to put  the club where they've got room.  Is that what you're saying  or is that a parking garage, Jimmy?  Well, yeah.  The parking garage is over there.  But you can see  there's a lot of casinos  for you to gamble in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I could just stay  in the Grand Peacock Tower.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, I have to go outside  in order to go to the comedy club?  No, no.  This is like an x-ray view  of the building.  It's a giant building, Ann.  Oh, I thought it was... 
[01:39:30]  It's not a shopping center.  No, no, no.  It's like if the roof  was taken off  so you could see inside.  Well, they should put it back on  if it rains.  All of a sudden,  everybody will be getting  purple rain on them.  Oh, Chip.  Yeah.  This big thing here,  that's the big theater here  where we aspire Jimmy  to play next time.  How big is that?  I don't know exactly.  It looks small on the webpage.  Yeah.  It's only an inch.  That's way too big for you.  You're stalling.  Where's Jimmy staying?  Yeah, I was curious  where our rooms are.  Where's Jimmy staying?  Enough with the stall tactics. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, where is it?  You see here on the bottom left  this L-shaped building?  Uh-huh.  Where?  You're pointing at the wall screen.  It doesn't even have a name.  Oh, right there.  The bottom left L-shaped building?  Okay, gotcha.  That's the Grand Cedar Hotel.  Oh.  The ones,  those are the rooms  away from the luxury.  Yeah.  No.  That's where they put the farmers.  No, you got it all wrong, Anthony.  It's a hotel full of farmers.  It's pretty far from the MGM tower.  That's brand new.  The Grand Cedar,  that's the place to see  and be seen.  Is that where I'm staying? 
[01:40:30]  The Grand Cedar?  Yes.  I'm so happy.  Can we see rooms  from the Grand Cedar?  How do we see a picture  of a room  from the Grand Cedar?  I just want to see  where Jimmy's going to be staying.  You know,  you'll be kind of tired  from the long walk  to my room,  but there's plenty  of accommodations.  There's a butler  that will take care  of your every whim.  The Grand Cedar,  that's the oldest one,  of course.  You know what I want to,  oh, God.  But it's complete.  Oh, God, no.  Not that room.  We've all seen that room. 
[01:41:00]  It's completely renovated.  It's renovated?  That's where I'm staying?  I'm so happy  I didn't fucking plug this  on The Tonight Show.  I'm so happy I didn't.  You said you didn't care  where you're sleeping, though.  Mine said  you didn't care.  Jimmy says  stay close to the action.  I told you,  that's the place  to see and be seen.  See, that's how  they promote those rooms.  Stay close to the action.  We like the rooms  that are near the action  to not be very good  because the people  aren't really going to be  staying in their rooms.  You're so going to be  smelling cigarettes 
[01:41:30]  smoked the whole weekend.  Are you going to be  eating in the steakhouse?  Yeah.  Because, you know,  you can join me and Jimmy  in the employee cafeteria.  Wait, what?  How many vouchers  did you get?  I have a three-day pass.  For the employee cafeteria.  Oh, my God.  Are you telling me,  hold on.  Now, in this  great cedar hotel.  Remember,  you don't mind  where you're staying, Jimmy.  Accent on great.  How many staircases  are in his room? 
[01:42:00]  That's it.  No steps.  What do you want to go up?  You get exhausted  up and down stairs.  How an elevator.  So what does my suite  look like  in the Grand Cedar Hotel?  Scroll down.  There's got to be a suite.  Come on.  They can't just all be  those rooms.  Deluxe rooms.  No, no.  One-bedroom suite.  Oh, one-bedroom suite.  Sweet.  Look at that.  All right.  No picture, huh?  900 square feet.  Do you know what  you can do  with 900 square feet?  That's a lot of square footage.  That's a lot of square footage.  That's the size  of my apartment, actually.  Once you put it square, though, 
[01:42:30]  it's not as big  as it should be,  up to six people  with one king  or two double beds,  a living room  offers an entertainment center,  a bay window  with a sofa,  a half bath.  All right.  All right.  You know what?  That may be tolerable.  All right.  At least you got  a separate living room bedroom.  Yeah, I can talk of it.  You don't want to have  the same bedroom living room.  I would like to have been  in the newer building, though.  But you've got a jacuzzi tub.  Hold on.  Joey from Long Island 
[01:43:00]  is saying you can get  a room at the Grand Cedar,  the basic room,  for $69.  Why are we in the Grand Cedar  and not the MGM?  Oh, you should be in the MGM.  It's brand new.  Why am I not in the fucking...  Why would I do the Borgata  that they put me in the...  Water Club.  Water Club.  Yeah.  The Borgata Club is amazing.  Say tits.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah.  The tits.  Jimmy, it feels great  to be in the same hotel as you.  I gamble once a year.  I spend about $200,  and I get the same room  as you for $69. 
[01:43:30]  Well, Jimmy's got the nicest room.  The $69 a night hotel.  Sam, could you go back  to my luxurious suite,  and I want to read  what the room includes,  because we didn't really read about it.  I'm sure it's just a regular...  It's probably like the Grand Cedar,  but a little newer.  These suites average  1,400 square feet.  Wow.  And include living rooms,  wet bars,  jacuzzi tubs,  large screen TVs,  and 24-hour butler service. 
[01:44:00]  The villa guests enjoy  24-hour room service,  and complimentary valet service.  Ooh.  There was a lot of S's  at the end of your stuff.  A lot of service.  No, TVs.  Jacuzzis.  Oh, there's not one TV  in that fucking room.  Living rooms.  Rooms.  Yeah, there's rooms.  There's upstairs, downstairs.  Why couldn't we get  in the MGM hotel?  I was hoping to get  a Tonight Show plug.  That would have been  my bargaining.  That would have helped  a little bit.  But did we ask for that,  and they said no? 
[01:44:30]  I'll talk to you later.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The I'll talk to you later.  That's never good.  Oh, look at that window.  That window's  two stories high.  Oh, I can't wait  till you throw yourself out.  This is going to be  a Herman Munster cutout  of you holding two queens.  And by that,  I mean Danny and Keith. 
[01:45:00]  Ah, shit.  I was just going to bash you  with the queens comment.  James, let's look  on the bright side.  We're not staying...  You might die.  You might die.  This ain't terrible.  We're not staying  at the Two Trees Inn  across the street.  Oh, shit.  The Two Trees Inn.  So it could always be worse  is what you're saying.  It looks the same  as the other room.  It's like the Grand Cedar.  It's the Grand Cedar.  The Grand Cedar. 
[01:45:30]  Why aren't they  taking care of Jimmy Norton?  Well, they're paying him  a boatload of money.  No, they're not.  Once they see...  Let me tell you something.  A boatload?  It's a small boat.  Once they see  the people  that Jimmy Norton  brings in  to that place,  they're going to  treat him  with respect.  That's the whole thing.  This is the first time  here.  Yeah, yeah.  They're feeling you out.  They're feeling you out.  But you know what?  Jimmy Norton doesn't have  to audition  for these people  in order to get a room  at the MGM.  He didn't have to  fill out credit forms either.  Exactly.  He didn't have to 
[01:46:00]  put up his house  in order to get that room.  See, I wouldn't...  The high roll of rooms  have to go to high roll.  That I get.  Because as a casino,  you've got to take care  to guys who are  betting a fucking  lot of money.  I would like to have  been in the MGM.  You know,  the nice new hotel.  When you come over,  I want to have  the butler come in  and say,  my friend and I  would like some  coffee and cake.  And I'll ring  a little bell.  Who wants you  to ring the bell?  You got a butler  on that roll.  This is basically...  Of course.  I wouldn't say 
[01:46:30]  boatload of money,  though.  Is it the same  money shirts or what?  I got that ironed  comedy club.  You can have them ironed?  Iron my heavy metal  t-shirts.  The butlers do  everything, though.  They make sure  if you want to go  to the steakhouse.  Mr. Kumia,  where would you like  dinner tonight?  I go to the steakhouse.  They go,  what time?  Not,  we'll see when  there's an opening.  What time?  That's 7.30.  You got it.  How many?  How many people?  Mr. Norton  would like to join me.  And, of course,  Club Soda Kenny  will also be. 
[01:47:00]  We'll have to leave  an extra hour  for Mr. Norton  to arrive  from the Grand Cedar Hotel.  He's got to take  the shuttle.  He gets to take  the jitney.  The jitney  with the old  fucking slot machine  people.  Oh, Jimmy.  He's got to take  the mono rail.  Well, it's going to be  a great weekend  for you guys.  It certainly is.  I'm looking forward to it.  The club is supposedly  very good.  Patrice liked the club  and it's a brand new  comedy club,  so I'm sure that club  is phenomenal. 
[01:47:30]  So, what time  does the limo  come and pick you guys up?  Oh, Jimmy's got a driver.  What, are you kidding me?  Yes, I do.  Yeah?  Yes, I do.  I just say,  Lurch, what time  are we leaving?  There's plenty of leg room  in the back of Kenny's car.  Oh, shake and beg Lenny  will be in the back seat.  Yeah, Lenny Marcus.  Where do they have Lenny  staying in fucking Hartford?  That's a good joke.  That's a good local joke  right there, people.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy. 
[01:48:00]  That's good.  It's going to be  a fun time for all.  Look, who cares  about what kind of room  and the fact that  I'm driving  two and a half hours up,  coming back to do radio  and then going back up,  who cares?  That is true.  It's two and a half hours  each way?  Yeah.  So you're going to be  exhausted.  By the next time we see you,  you're going to be  on the road for five hours?  And then have  two and a half hours back up.  They don't have the jet  anymore, by the way.  That pissed me off.  Yeah, I think Foxwoods  had one, too, though.  Then tell them you're not  going unless they get you 
[01:48:30]  there in a jet.  Well, I'll take the limo.  I sleep on the way.  Play some ball with these guys.  I sleep on the way.  Maybe watch some movies.  The stories on Monday  should be great.  Drink like a motherfucker.  Yeah.  I want to...  You don't drink as much  anymore, I thought.  No, not during the week,  but this is a weekend,  my friend,  and it's a weekend  at a casino.  Look out Sunday.  My heads are going  to be hurting.  How high up are we?  Oh, no.  Make sure your window's  locked.  I requested a high floor. 
[01:49:00]  Okay.  How high up are we?  Poor Kenny.  It's just going to be  ground level.  Kenny's going to...  Oh, God.  Kenny's going to hear  it all weekend.  No, I don't...  Kenny does a good job,  so I never get mad at Kenny.  Who are you going to get  mad at, Jimmy,  when you see your room?  It depends on how  the room is.  I'll call the agent  and ask him,  what did you ask for?  What was their response?  Sweet, it sounds  like it'll be all right.  I know.  You like to be  in the new hotel,  though.  You do like to be  in the new one.  Smells like fresh paint.  Tell him to move him  to the MGM. 
[01:49:30]  You like to be...  I don't need the  fucking high roller suite.  I'm not unreasonable.  But you like to be  in the new hotel.  That's, you know...  I'm a reasonable man.  Get him the new hotel.  Yeah, he should be  in the MGM.  Borgata puts me  in the...  The water club.  The fucking suite.  The water club.  The water club.  I am to the water club.  That water club is nice.  Oh, it's beautiful.  I like that water club.  It's beautiful.  We have those  fucking little rascal races  in there.  It's so much fun.  We take...  What, in the casinos?  No, in the room.  I know.  I was setting you up nice. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, thank you.  I was setting you up nice.  In the room.  Because people out there  were thinking, you know,  in the casino.  But no, that's how big  your fucking room is.  You get the little rascal  and then you go  into one bedroom.  You fucking turn  in the bathroom.  You come zooming out  and you hit the tables  and shit.  It's a pisser.  You want to hear a...  I stayed in Jim's room  and it's not that bad?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, let's hear that.  Do you want a not that bad comment?  Yeah, absolutely.  J.R. in Connecticut there.  Yes, J.R.  What's going on, boys?  Hi, J.R.  Yeah, Jimmy. 
[01:50:30]  Like two or three years ago,  I was up there  with some friends  and one of them  got too drunk  and I was gambling enough  that they gave me the room.  It was nice.  Imagine like two motel six rooms  back to back  with a door in between them.  That sounds great.  But the beautiful thing is,  by tomorrow,  you guys will have  a full report on my room.  That's true, yeah.  It's rare that I'll go away  to do a Thursday  and come back  and do the show.  But I've been away  for a long time.  I missed a few days  so I don't want to miss  too much this week.  That's dedication.  Sure is.  That is commendable,  Mr. Norton.  We'll see what the room looks like. 
[01:51:00]  Maybe it'll be very acceptable.  As soon as I get up there today,  I have to go to bed.  So we will have the room early,  I hope.  That's the plan, yes.  That's the plan.  Is it a guarantee?  Guaranteed early check-in?  It's to our sitcom.  They really are.  Do we have it?  Is it a guarantee?  We are getting a VIP welcoming committee.  Oh, those are nice.  What does that mean?  A nice fruit bowl in the room?  Why is your face turning red?  Why is his face turning red?  I just wish somebody else  was listening to the radio 
[01:51:30]  at this moment.  Why?  Oh, interesting.  No, because I have these conversations  with certain people.  Oh, I gotcha.  You know, I'm in a certain spot  on the totem pole,  and I do what I'm told.  Nice Foxwoods totem pole.  I like how you did that.  But do I have a guaranteed check-in?  That's all I care about.  Allegedly.  Oh, no.  Imagine if Jimmy doesn't even have a room.  It's like, oh, yeah,  you're going to have to stay at the end.  It's 4 o'clock. 
[01:52:00]  We're going to get up there.  I can't wait for tomorrow's show.  Yeah, here's what you're going to hear.  Yeah, none of the rooms are cleaned yet.  Yeah, you're going to have to...  4 o'clock is when we have check-in.  And Jimmy will just fucking...  If we hear that...  Oh, no!  I will throw the money out  and get in the car and come home.  Holy shit!  If I hear that I can't check-in,  I will turn around and come home.  And come home.  And blow the money.  Kenny. 
[01:52:30]  Wow!  Kenny, it's now to you.  The comedy club owner  is supposed to meet us  at the front door.  Oh, so you could sleep  at the comedy club  on one of the couches or something  if you need a snooze.  Yeah, to take you to the green room  to take a nap.  Yeah, the green room's probably nice.  A couch in there?  A bed bug couch.  No, there's no bed bugs.  Look at you  with your bed bug rumors spreading.  He's supposed to meet us  with our key packs.  Okay, I'm sure we'll be fine.  All right.  Yeah, you'll be fine.  They're not going to treat you 
[01:53:00]  like shit, get Jimmy Norton  for fuck's sake.  No, we still wanted the MGM.  Go in there, I know.  Can we try to get that?  Let's get the MGM for Jimmy.  We should.  Let's do that.  Just tell me,  can we try to get that?  I'll get back to you.  Oh, boy.  All right, listen,  we've got to take a break.  Very good.  Oh, boy.  I can't wait to hear tomorrow's show.  Oh, wait, I'll be part of tomorrow's show.  I can't wait for Jimmy  to be back here tomorrow.  We should demand  Jimmy gets a room in the MGM.  Well, at this point,  the hotel's sold out,  so I don't know.  Sold out?  Were they sold out  when we asked?  That's the question.  If they were sold out, 
[01:53:30]  I can't expect them  to boot somebody.  Yes, you can.  Big A can't even get a room  Saturday night.  Wow.  Wow.  Not Big A.  Holy shit.  Shh.  It.  All right.  It's going to be  a great fucking show.  A lot of people.  Great night.  They're animals.  Fucking animal listeners.  They're going to fucking  go bullshit for you.  I hope so.  The club got good reviews  from the one comedian  I know who worked 
[01:54:00]  at the first weekend.  This is the second weekend  at the club.  Patrice.  The second weekend.  Patrice said the rooms  are okay also.  He doesn't want to hear okay.  Was it true that the people  that worked there  at Foxwoods  were looking at Patrice  going,  Tatanka.  Tatanka.  Patrice had to do  a private show  for the tribal  whatever council.  Are you shitting me?  He had to go in front of them  and like fucking audition?  That was his Thursday show?  Make sure he wasn't crazy  or something, right?  I guess because it was  the first grand opening show. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, they wanted  probably their own.  Yeah.  I remember when I was  with Andrew back in the day  that he stopped  doing Indian casinos  for that reason.  Oh, really?  He didn't want to do  the meet and greet  with all them Indians.  Why?  What the hell?  They're actually one of the  groups of people I like  in this country.  American Indians.  Mind them?  They're one of the few  groups that doesn't  irritate me.  Casinos?  They're making a living?  It's great.  It's going to be  a great weekend, James.  It certainly is.  Yeah, Anthony's just teasing you.  I'm looking forward to it.  I'm not worried about that.  I have multiple bedrooms 
[01:55:00]  in there.  Anytime you want to come up  and grab one,  who knows?  It's just fucking,  it's going to be  fucking crash pad.  I should just stay  with Anthony.  It'd be crazy.  He really just...  Oh, that's so you could  hear the drunken babble  of me, Keith, and Danny.  And I can try to sneak  whoever my guest is  in.  Just don't talk.  Don't let them hear  your voice.  They'll see the wig.  They won't know anything.  Okay.  That's Kenny.  That's the big reveal. 
[01:55:30]  Can't wait.  Kenny's a tranny.  All right, we'll break,  get into, I don't know,  maybe Jocktober,  maybe Perez Hilton  on Ellen DeGeneres.  He's stopping his  cum bubble thing.  Yeah.  And other things  to talk about,  but first this.  The Opie and Anthony  show presents  Under the Gun,  the verbal annihilation  of one Opie and Anthony  show member.  Today,  primetime,  Sam Roberts.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Die, Sam, die.  Oh, my head 
[01:56:00]  is covered in pubes.  Sam loves black dick.  You should get a job  on WPU.  I want you to jump off  the George Washington Bridge.  Drown Sam in period blood.  You suck and you're a tardy.  Set Sam's hair on fire.  You sound like a progeria kid.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Oh, God,  what are you,  in fucking junior high?  You stink, Sam.  Who else will feel the wrath?  Find out on the next  Under the Gun.  The Opie and Anthony show  show, show, show, show, 
[01:56:30]  on the virus.  Sweet,  ex-exam.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Nice bottom end on that.  Roger Moore is 83 years old today.  Wow.  Yeah.  That just popped off the page.  What did you think of the Roger Moore years  of James Bond?  I couldn't even name one of the movies he did.  Octopussy?  That was the one I was going to say,  I swear to God.  Yeah?  He did Octopussy? 
[01:57:00]  Octopussy.  I don't know.  How is Roger Moore 83 years old?  That's fucked up.  Roger Moore was the very campy,  kind of,  the spy who loved me.  He was the very campy James Bond.  I wasn't a big fan of the Roger Moore,  James Bond.  He wasn't bad.  It was during a time where a lot of people  went to see Roger Moore,  James Bond movies.  They all went to see Roger Moore movies.  James Bond 007.  When is he coming in that hour? 
[01:57:30]  I know, we need Ira.  Now we're putting a lot of pressure on the weirdo.  Moonraker.  Moonraker was Roger Moore, sure.  Roger Moore.  He was like a sexy guy in the movie.  Now he's 83 years old.  Now he's 83.  Doddering old fool.  Breaking hips left and right at this point, right?  Yeah.  Brett Favreau gets hit in the balls by a football  during the Vikings practice.  Hopefully his dick swelled up a little bit.  Get it?  Because it's small. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Video's pretty good.  It's on that blog,  that sports blog,  Puddle of AIDS.  Is that his spot?  No, what is it?  I don't know.  Whatever.  Find it yourself.  Blog.  I tweeted it yesterday.  Whatever.  It's out there.  That's a good question.  But it happened this past,  like a day or so ago.  We're all talking about Brett Favre's cock,  and next thing you know,  in practice,  a football hits him in the cock.  Hits him in the cock?  He goes down,  and not one player cares at all.  Oh, Ted Williams head.  Right.  It's the website.  Yeah.  Ted Williams head.  Head and shoulders above all other sports blogs. 
[01:58:30]  Yes.  Ted Williams head.  That's funny.  Oh, what the hell is that?  Well, what do we...  What do we got here?  Hi.  Well.  Let me see that.  Yep.  Wadda-dee.  There it is.  Is that Brett getting hit in the nuts?  Yeah.  And watch.  He goes down.  He does go down.  Practice two days ago.  Doesn't the guy wear a cup?  Or a day ago.  Whatever.  A little thimble.  What happened to him?  Let's see.  No one cares.  All right.  He's on the sideline. 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  I should have yelled two.  Florentine twittered that somebody hit Brett Favre in the nuts.  They must have had good aim.  Because he has a little dick.  A little tiny wee wee.  He's just trying to show the world that his cock's big enough to get hit by a football,  I guess.  But yeah, there goes Brett Favre.  So that's for your viewing pleasure.  TedWilliams.com.  What is it?  Ted Williams head.  TedWilliamshead.com.  It's a pretty good sports blog site.  That's a good name for a website, man. 
[01:59:30]  Anthony, you want to do a little Jacktober?  You know something?  You never have to ask me that because I always want to do Jacktober.  Really?  Oh.  And Vic Henley's coming in at 9 o'clock.  We should promote that.  Yeah.  I don't know Vic Henley.  Vic is a funny guy, man.  He's been around for a long time.  He's from, I think, Arkansas.  But he's a funny fucking dude.  I'm really happy he's booked.  Nice.  Yes, he'll be in a little later.  I forgot he was coming in.  I love Vic.  In the program.  In about a half hour.  And I think Dr. Steve is wandering the hallways. 
[02:00:00]  Are you kidding?  He's finally here?  He's here for his New York visit and he'll be on the show tomorrow doing What the Hell  Is That?  And maybe we'll have him in today, of course.  I just saw that shitbag.  Hi-ya.  Could do some promo here.  Wow.  Yeah.  But first, let's do some Jocktober.  It's Jocktober.  It's Jocktober.  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of fantastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Great.  Thank you. 
[02:00:30]  So turn up this turntacular radio.  Oh my God, I can't believe it.  It's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Sambo, where are we going today?  Yes.  Well, today we're going a little closer to here in New York, but not quite New York.  All right.  To Providence, Rhode Island.  Oh!  Providence, Rhode Island.  Oh!  Providence, Rhode Island.  I tried to do a little radio in Providence, Rhode Island.  What happened?  They didn't want anything to do with me. 
[02:01:00]  Really?  When I was an up-and-comer, I sent my tapes to Providence, Rhode Island.  Wow.  As a matter of fact, I believe I sent a little demo tape to this fine radio station.  To that station?  We're about to talk about.  Yeah, let's see what they were looking for.  Many years ago.  Obviously, this station knows what they're doing.  All right.  And filled their slots well with Paul and Al on the home of rock and roll.  Is this our first home of rock and roll?  Featured on Jocktober? 
[02:01:30]  I think there was one in the very beginning.  Okay.  Look at his pants.  Dr. Steve wears old-school jeans.  Pants.  They're fucking horrible.  That fucking rotten shirt.  I don't like Dr. Steve's gait.  I don't like his gait.  I don't like Dr. Steve's...  I'm just here to conduct a little business.  I gotta do promo.  He walks like a doctor should walk, right?  He does.  He's walking down the hallway to a waiting room.  And he found jeans that look like slacks. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  They have that same look of slacks.  Yeah.  I gotta go down and do a little bit of promo for my show.  It's so dead on, man.  Holy shit.  What the hell is that?  People are gonna come in and, you know, see.  Some kind of built fluid.  Fluid.  Paul and Al from W.H.  Paul and Al.  Paul and Al.  Okay, Al.  Why?  In Providence, Rhode Island. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  They don't have a hole.  No hole.  No hole.  All right.  So that's good.  So that's a plus.  That means it's probably a little better than the current fare we're used to for Jocktober.  These guys are old-timers.  They've been around a while.  They're like two guys.  Two guys.  They're doing a little morning radio, but they're now a bit up there in a...  Yeah, I think this is...  Format?  It's the home of rock and roll.  Oh, excuse me.  That's right.  All right.  And I think this is either their 20th or 25th year.  Holy shit. 
[02:03:00]  On the radio.  Wow.  On your radio dial.  On your radio dial.  Radio dial.  All right.  They start off with the top five reasons.  Princess Leia.  Very topical.  Yeah, I mean, we hope.  Oh, God.  Very topical.  We all heard the news story.  So they're doing a top something list?  Top five.  How many?  Top five?  Yeah.  Because everyone knows top ten is too...  Yeah, it's my idea.  Everyone knows top ten is too long for radio. 
[02:03:30]  Scorch.  I got to get a light to it.  Scorch loves top ten.  I do my top...  Does he do top ten?  Top ten.  Top ten.  And I hear...  You said before, Scorch, by the way, has some new TV shows we can look forward to.  Well, let's just say Jocktober is not just about celebrating radio shows.  It's celebrating the jocks and the things they do.  Oh, God.  You're changing our bit.  Well, let's just say...  It's okay for that?  Fine.  Exactly.  Let's just say if Scruff sent me ten new episodes of PFG TV... 
[02:04:00]  PFG, pretty fucking good TV.  Pretty fucking good.  Right, right.  Starring our old pal, Scorch.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  All right.  Top five reasons Princess Leia did coke.  Well, here it is.  The top five Princess Leia excuses for doing blow.  All right.  Number five.  Well, because Yoda smoked all the meth.  This is good with...  Number four.  Because if she had smoked pot, she'd end up eating those honey buns that were on the side  of her head.  Do that?  Is it 1977? 
[02:04:30]  Number three.  It was fun to cut it with a lightsaber.  I could picture that.  Number two.  She was living an unsavory lifestyle back then anyway.  In fact, her nickname was Jabba the Slut.  Oh, yeah.  That's her...  That was him asking for a happy ending.  But the top Princess Leia excuse for doing blow.  Oh, come on. 
[02:05:00]  Who cares?  It happened a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  Be more funny.  They didn't give the number one reason.  That was pretty good stuff.  Was it that it happened in a galaxy a long time ago?  Yes.  Because the movie started with...  That was the number one?  A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  So...  A little big.  But...  That was...  It would still matter even though if it happened a long time ago.  I noticed one thing.  What?  I'm getting angry a lot faster. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's Jack.  I told you.  It took like a while for me to get kind of mad.  Yeah.  Now, one bit from these fucking jocks and I'm angry.  You didn't like that bit?  No, Jimmy.  It's also funny because the jocktober segments themselves get shorter and shorter because  you guys refuse to talk about it and just pump through the tracks.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In the beginning, these things go like an hour and a half.  Now I'm lucky if it's 20 minutes.  Oh, yeah, because they stink. 
[02:06:00]  I'm trying to do more radio for the people.  Wow.  I know.  You try to fit as much as you can in.  We're trying to squeeze as much as we can in.  Yes, we do.  We can in.  It's amazing what you do.  It's the Clinton's anniversary as we continue with jocktober with Paul and Al and...  Bill and Hillary.  Bill and Hillary's anniversary and they have an exclusive interview with the president,  Anthony.  Well...  Exclusive interview with...  I will say this.  Somehow they got Kevin the stunt boy to do the interview.  Kevin the stunt boy.  The stunt boy.  President Clinton, they had the Hillary and Bill's anniversary earlier this week. 
[02:06:30]  It's 94HJWise, Kevin.  We're talking to former President Bill Clinton on the line.  How are you doing?  Glad to see you.  Well, I just wanted to wish you a happy anniversary, sir.  What?  Today is your anniversary with Hillary.  That's impossible.  No, I'm serious.  Can you describe the...  Holy shit, it doesn't even fucking...  What are they going for here?  I know they're using old fucking clips, but they don't...  It's Dickie Goodman.  It's Dickie Goodman, but there's no continuity.  Mr. President, Mr. President, what would you do if Hillary came home? 
[02:07:00]  All right, Dickie Goodman asshole.  Why would he answer...  Why would he go what?  You see, he's such a womanizer that he was unaware that it was his anniversary.  Why would he say good to see you on the phone?  Yeah.  Instead of how are you?  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Well, I just wanted to wish you a happy anniversary, sir.  What?  Today is your anniversary with Hillary.  That's impossible.  No, I'm serious.  Can you describe the state of your marriage these days?  Remember that ice storm we had? 
[02:07:30]  Right, so not good, huh?  No.  Holy shit, I'm just as mad as you now.  What's wrong?  Because it's infuriating.  They're fucking lazy.  Like, if you're going to do this type of bit, then you fucking either adjust your questions  so they make sense to the clips you picked out.  It's like Clinton's anniversary.  Like, I'm assuming that the reason you guys are talking about Perez Hilton later is that  you'll have some kind of crazy Perez Hilton bit after the... 
[02:08:00]  No!  No?  Is this supposed to be bad on purpose, like?  Is it supposed to not make sense on purpose?  Then I would get it.  No, it's supposed to be funny.  It's a funny interview.  It is kind of funny.  Marriage these days?  Remember that ice storm we had?  Right, so not good, huh?  No.  What's the number one problem with your marriage, would you say?  I love women.  Right, and we've heard a rumor that you pay these women on the side?  Yes.  And how much do you pay them?  $2.40 a pound.  Well, that's kind of a lot.  Yes.  Do you still get with fat chicks like Monica Lewinsky, or... 
[02:08:30]  No.  Any reason for that, or...  Fat people smell sick.  I agree, um...  Yes.  No more Jacktober.  You don't want to do it ever again?  Ever again.  You don't even want to finish this CD, or...  No!  Oh, man.  It's falling out.  We should have...  That was the end of the bit.  That's how it just ended, by the way.  We should have Jacktober Day.  Where it's just...  Just one day where we...  How about kind of...  Jacktober segment.  Segment? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Jacktoberfest.  It's not a month.  It's October hour.  It's just an event.  It's just one day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We could dedicate one hour to the entire month of October.  And these guys have been around a while.  They have no excuses.  They're the reason that you didn't get a job.  They had falling out.  I was...  This was probably before them.  Who needs Opie?  You got Paul and Al.  And that was just their fucking B team.  That was the stunt boy guy.  That's Kevin the stunt boy.  All right, Ant.  Well, good news.  Another bit.  This time about Tom Brady and Randy Moss.  I mean, you heard about their rivalry. 
[02:09:30]  Those two weren't getting along at the end of their time together.  Topical.  Paul and Al on the home of Rock and Roll 94HJY in Providence.  What if I told you that the greatest quarterback wide receiver tandem in NFL history parted ways over an argument about personal grooming habits?  What if I told you that Tom Brady and Randy Moss fought like a couple of catty women about scruffy beards and Justin Bieber hairstyles?  ESPN Films presents...  Your haircut makes you look like a little girl.  Oh, yeah, Randy? 
[02:10:00]  Well, your beard is gay.  Followed by part two of the series.  Oh, yeah?  Well, my dad could beat up your dad.  Nuh-uh.  Yuh-huh.  Nuh-uh.  La, la, la, la.  I can't hear you.  The story of turmoil for the 2010 New England Patriots.  That's tonight on ESPN Films.  Check your local listings.  Paul and Al.  Weekdays on 94HJY.  That is a great fucking voice that guy's got.  What?  Holy shit.  Oh, that one guy, the announcer.  Paul and Al.  Yeah, holy shit. 
[02:10:30]  That's all I noticed.  Everything else was a dull fucking throb in my head.  The other guy sound like the guy from Lost.  That awful voice guy?  Yes.  Awful voice guy.  Is that a prep burger bit?  It sounded like a prep burger bit.  Could be, yeah.  They didn't even...  Do we belong to prep burger?  Oh, no.  No.  We tried, but they were on to us.  Wait, they were on to us?  They won't let you?  That would have been great to get fucking some of that shit.  How did they not let you belong to it?  Slap it on.  They were on to us.  Yeah.  I think you gotta pay or something.  I don't know.  Let's do it.  Yeah, I don't know.  I'll talk to management today about joining prep burger. 
[02:11:00]  Talk to management about us getting prep burger.  Can we go to the website?  We're an important morning show.  We should be...  The prep burger site?  We should be doing...  Do we got some free samples?  Yeah, where are the samples?  We need some free samples.  Prep burger sucks.  Well, we continue with the Jacktober with Paul and Al.  A long forced break about the minors leading to a...  Anyone?  Erection?  Anyone?  I'm just gonna...  I'm going out on a limb here.  A bit?  Ring the bell.  Song parody?  I don't know. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you.  94-H2.  I have a lot of people following all the minors coming.  Kind of amazing how energetic...  I'm following all the minors.  Not the guys with the lamps.  I'm energetic.  All these guys.  Hold on.  Let this pass.  Let these fucking chills pass.  It was perfect.  Hold it.  I'm hyperventilating.  It was perfect, Anthony.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  Where's Dr. Steve?  I need a sedative.  Holy shit, y'all.  That was perfect.  Minors.  Michael Jackson.  Yeah, we get the minor joke.  Bringing it all together. 
[02:12:00]  I liked it.  Holy shit.  I liked that part of the band.  One more fucking minor, minor joke, and someone's fucking dying.  What?  That's the only one that made that comparison, minor, minor.  Yeah.  And then to throw a Michael Jackson reference in there.  Wow.  That's topical.  His jaw fucking fell a year ago.  He's only been dead a year.  A little over a year.  Yeah, a little over.  But it happened.  It takes only a year for the jaw to drop.  I would think so.  On Michael Jackson, he didn't have much fucking tissue left on that face. 
[02:12:30]  Like a mummy.  See, that's a good joke right there.  That guy just going.  He looks.  Oh, my God.  They should totally dig him up and see if he looks exactly like he did in Thriller.  I bet he does.  That'd be cool.  You know how mad people would be?  He'd do a little dance, but his arm would fall off this time because he's all beef jerky.  We got Rhode Island checking in.  Brian?  Hey, guys.  I fucking hate Paul and Al.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Come on. 
[02:13:00]  Open your mind, man.  Open mind.  Open minded here.  Let's listen to a little more.  What's the matter with you?  They do this bit called Stump the DJ.  It's like Stump the Joke Man, and they get fucking pissed when you call up and go, two  gay guys walk into a bar and say, hi, my name's Paul.  This is my boyfriend, Al.  Oh, good gravy.  Good gravy.  Why would they get mad at that?  He's gone.  All right.  Back to the minor talking. 
[02:13:30]  The guys with the lamps on their hands.  Energetic, all these guys are.  Yeah, we just saw one.  Well, come on.  You would be, too, if you just finally got out.  And they look healthy, too.  I guess they were shooting some decent food down to them.  Anything that could fit down that little pipe hole.  Steroids.  Yeah.  They're all pumped up.  The problem is they were so pumped up that they couldn't fit through the hole they made  for them.  It was just big enough to get house of pizza roast beef sandwiches down.  Wow.  Now you're talking.  How about the guy who brought up a pocket full of rocks and was giving out pebbles of 
[02:14:00]  rocks?  Yeah.  Imagine if those rocks were all it needed for the structure to collapse down there.  You think about it.  He was the last one to come out.  If he was really smart, instead of handing them out, he'd go on eating.  Whose dentures are loose, by the way?  I'm not sure if someone's dentures are loose.  You can hear that?  Oh, yeah.  A little loose.  Just a little loose.  Loose.  For the, uh, for the, uh, for the structure to collapse down there. 
[02:14:30]  For the structure to collapse.  Talking over dentures.  I have been and always will be your friend.  Spock's, Spock's dentures.  They talk over them like they're afraid they're gonna...  Because it'll just fly out of their mouth at any given moment.  So it's them talking, but kind of keeping the mouth on the line.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You gotta, like, roll your fucking, uh, lips over your teeth.  Live long and pruff.  Took you right out of the fucking movie. 
[02:15:00]  Imagine if those rocks were all it needed for the, uh...  For the collapse.  For the structure to collapse down there.  Well, you think about it.  He was the last one to come out.  If he was really smart, instead of handing them out, he'd go on eBay and he'd sell them.  Like, $150, $200.  You know that they actually, they actually, uh, served up ribs down there.  I'm not sure if you knew.  They want their miners back, miners, back miners, back miners, back miners, back miners, back miners, back miners, back miners, back miners, back miners, back miners, back miners.  They want their miners back miners.  Chili's got them back.  It's just amazing stuff.  Let the record, uh, show that Sam was not laughing at the actual bit we were playing, but was laughing at what Anthony was doing during the bit. 
[02:15:30]  I can't help it.  Anthony's hiding behind his fucking Che Guevara shirt.  Yes.  I can't help it.  I can't look at anyone when that is happening.  Do you remember the Chili's commercial?  No.  Okay, the baby back miners.  That's probably why I was lost on that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, because it's Chili's.  Yeah.  And it was in Chili.  Right.  Miner back.  It's like baby back, baby, you know.  What do they say, though?  My miners back, miners back. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, Christ.  That's stunk.  No, I didn't like it at all.  That one day, it's going to make a great, great break.  Oh, just shut up.  Oh, my good gracious.  So, what else do these guys do? 
[02:16:30]  That's way better than what we're doing.  Oh, believe me.  You should just fucking say fuck it.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  Jack Tober, Paul and Alan, the home of Rock and Roll 94 H.J.Y. in Providence.  They bring up Brett Favre.  That way they can play a...  Song parody.  Bit.  Yeah.  A burger.  Give yourself another bit.  A bit?  Well, that's the secret to radio, is that sometimes you don't need to think of funny things to  say.  Uh-huh.  You can start a story, and then instead of it going someplace funny, you just go right 
[02:17:00]  into a pre-made bit.  Like Miner's Back.  I want my Miner's Back.  Miner's Back, Miner's Back, Miner's...  Chillies, and then it stops because...  Like, you guys had a whole angle on the Miners yesterday.  Did we?  Yeah.  Total waste of time.  Yes.  I mean, why did you do that?  Total waste of time.  Do you know how mad the world would have been if they just decided to cement in the  hole for cost?  See?  That's what we said.  Exactly.  Just troweling over.  We said just fucking, yeah.  Why are you guys coming up with funny stuff? 
[02:17:30]  We don't...  We should just...  I'll get radio prepped.  We'll get a bit.  Wait, we don't have a bit?  That'd be good.  We don't have a bit right now.  We're out here with no bits to rely on?  So what are you going to do?  Fuck.  Getting back to you, Pick Up Football, I'm going with Brett Favre.  This...  I can't even listen to the...  I know.  He's also...  They just had a conversation about football and actual games and stuff, and so he just  out of nowhere decides to...  He's going to go with Brett Favre.  I think he has a tough time with F words.  Oh, and then Brett Favre is not the player to pick. 
[02:18:00]  That's where the dentures get a little loose.  A little loose.  Getting back to you, Pick Up Football, I'm going with Brett Favre this week.  You are.  Yeah.  You got a...  Oh, Dallas and Minnesota, right?  Two one-in-three teams going at it.  I know.  It's going to be...  Now, although you were saying it's kind of on the fast track, the investigation, if he  indeed texted his penis...  Yeah, he could get suspended before very long, yeah.  Yeah, he could get suspended, and it may affect some of that NFL gear he endorses. 
[02:18:30]  Why would they say that?  Well, you stopped at such a weird time for them.  Why would they stop at a weird time?  Why would they bring that up?  Because...  That's weird.  That has nothing to do with anything.  Yeah, no one's really been talking about his endorsement deals or anything like that.  It doesn't...  So I'm stopping the tape to ask you, Sam Roberts, why would they bring that into the conversation  about Brett Favre?  Because if they hadn't seamlessly segged into that NFL gear commercial-type talk, there'd  be no reason to play the phony, silly parody commercial of the Brett Favre fathead. 
[02:19:00]  Where do you think that's going?  Fathead?  Why hasn't Kareem Abdul-Jabbar aged at all?  He's at Fox right now.  He's...  All I can do is look at the TV.  I love fucking Abdul-Jabbar.  I've been a huge fan of his.  I love Kareem.  But the guy's not...  Back in the day.  A long time ago?  Yeah, he was in the 57th Street studio.  Oh, that's right.  I wanted to...  I had something to do, and I wanted to meet him so bad.  Seven foot one, I think.  But he hasn't...  Very tall. 
[02:19:30]  He hasn't aged.  Look at him.  He has leukemia, too.  He said he had leukemia.  Oh, so the leukemia makes you look healthy.  I thought he changed his name to leukemia.  It's just a wacky name.  He doesn't believe in...  I know.  He doesn't believe in...  Islam.  Islam anymore, so now he's leukemia.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  He looks great.  I swear when he came...  Now, I'm not even fucking joking.  I looked up at the screen earlier when they had him standing there.  You know how they have the guest standing there and say,  coming up, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and he was standing there?  I thought it was a Madame Trousseau's wax museum thing. 
[02:20:00]  Right.  And that they had Kareem, for some reason, as a wax figure.  He has a little bit of gray in his mustache.  That's the only indicator that it's not 1986.  Yeah, he could put a little medicine in that, and he'd be fine.  You think?  Look at his hands.  His cock must be frightening to all creatures.  Oh, he's got a little chicken thing happening with his neck.  He looks amazing, though.  He retired, like, what, 87?  His last game was against the Pistons in a four-game sweep in the championship.  Black does not crack. 
[02:20:30]  When did he retire?  I want to say 88.  And I also need to know how old he is.  Fuck it up, Paul and Al.  I'm going to guess 88, and I'm going to guess he's in his early...  88?  I'm going to guess he's 64.  Oh, no, 60.  Yeah?  I'm going to guess 64 years old, and 1988 he retired.  It's a guess.  He didn't make the 90s playing basketball.  No, no, he lost.  It was a four-game sweep to the Pistons, which was his last game.  Holy shit.  He is 63.  Okay.  And retired in 89.  Okay.  89. 
[02:21:00]  God, I want to fucking meet Abdul-Jabbar.  See, now they're showing a picture of him from 1980.  See, that was from Airplane when he was the co-pilot.  He played for 20 years.  And now look at him.  It's kind of hard to figure out a role for me.  I always wanted to be in Star Wars, like...  Oh, that's right.  He's a karate guy, Bruce Lee.  He's a black belt.  Yeah, he was in a Bruce Lee movie.  Fucking Game of Death.  He knows some black belt shit.  He, uh...  Yeah, man.  Fuck.  Highest scorer in NBA history, Abdul-Jabbar.  Yep.  Greatest still. 
[02:21:30]  I'm so happy Jordan didn't get that.  Really?  Yeah, I love Kareem.  I don't want anybody to break that record.  The most gentle skyhook.  What a sweetie.  Had that nice soft touch.  Oh, dude.  Then Magic had the baby hook.  And also the Yates.  Nah, that's potato, man.  He was pulling out.  Could get suspended.  And it may affect some of that NFL gear he endorses.  Fathead Wall Graphics announces the newest addition to our lineup of larger-than-life sports heroes. 
[02:22:00]  It's the Brett Favre Fathead.  You won't believe how easily the Brett Favre Fathead sticks to the wall.  And once Brett Favre is up, he's easy to get off.  The fathead of Viking QB Brett Favre is totally lifelike, right down to his purple helmet.  Brett Favre.  He's the biggest fathead of them all.  Get your hands on one today.  Prep Burger?  Prep Burger.  Yeah, for sure.  That one is definitely Prep Burger.  Yeah, that's Prep Burger. 
[02:22:30]  That's a Prep Burger thing.  But they're talking about his penis.  What do you mean?  Oh, I just thought they were selling...  I thought that was actually a spot.  No, no, no, no, no.  I thought they were showing us what kind of commercials they play.  Was that double entendre stuff or subtle stuff?  Yeah.  To get them off and purple helmet and stuff.  Oh, that was penis stuff.  Because Brett Favre's penis pictures.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I didn't realize.  Oh.  It's the home of rock and roll.  And Anthony, good news.  We end today's Jocktober with Paul and Alan, the home of rock and roll, 94HJY in Providence, 
[02:23:00]  with a bonus.  Yeah.  A bonus what?  Song parody.  Bit.  Yeah, that's right.  Bit.  Bonus bit.  Good.  Yeah.  About what?  The minors.  Bonus.  Keep thinking topical.  So, not minors, but what are guys interested in?  Sports.  Yeah.  Keep thinking.  Children.  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  Now, a bonus bit.  About what?  World Series.  No.  It doesn't.  It's a bonus bit. 
[02:23:30]  That means there's more of what they already gave us.  It could be something we've done.  I forgot what they talked about already.  But we just played it.  All I know is that deep voice guy.  That was good.  Are you feeling the pressure?  I'm feeling the pressure.  There's not supposed to be pressure.  There's no quizzes in Jocktober.  It's a second Brett Favre bit.  Brett Favre.  A bonus bit.  I couldn't imagine the first one was so good that they had to do another one.  That's right.  I'm uncomfortable when I get my junk caught in the zipper of my Wranglers when my wife  catches me emailing photos of my manhood to my mistress. 
[02:24:00]  What the hell are you doing?  Oh!  Um, nothing.  I'm uncomfortable.  Prep Burger, huh?  Oh, for sure.  But isn't the joke that he has a small penis?  They wouldn't be getting stuck in no Wrangler jeans.  Well, that's the inherent problem with Prep Burger, that the people who do Prep Burger  aren't terribly funny.  So then when you mix it with Paul and Al...  I'm uncomfortable when my wife finds out I've been giving it to a Jets employee the 
[02:24:30]  past several years.  You son of a bitch!  I'll kill you!  I'm uncomfortable when Randy Moss makes fun of the size of my package.  Yo, Brett, I've seen them photos online.  Brady's bigger than you are.  Shut up, Randy.  I'm Brett Favre.  My retirement is not going to be comfortable.  I'm going to take you for every penny you have!  You cheating man whore!  Where's the other half? 
[02:25:00]  No, no, no.  Where it gets funny.  Yeah, why do they take out the punchline?  Where's the punchline?  That's the conclusion.  Isn't there a, um...  There should be a punchline if you're doing a bit.  It's the end of the commercial.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Providence, Rhode Island.  Ryan, you want to defend Paul and Al?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I've been listening to these guys for years, alright?  And I just...  I think it's shitty you guys are just picking and choosing bits.  They are fucking hilarious.  Frunkus?  They are.  Frunkus?  No, no Frunkus.  Well, what?  No.  He goes, no, no Frunkus.  I mean, uh, no. 
[02:25:30]  Because he knows what Frunkus is.  It's what you yell when you know you're lying to us.  What you need to do, you're getting the wrong bit.  The wrong bit.  Yeah.  The wrong bit is when they call the bar and they say they need to go see a little Jimmy  Norton this weekend.  There he is.  You know what?  I did not see that coming.  I saw that.  Thank you, sir.  I mean, this was all taken from one show.  Wow.  So there's no cherry-picking accusations.  This is, yeah, this is all good stuff from one show, right?  Right. 
[02:26:00]  This is the best of Wednesdays.  Do they play the punchlines of the first day on the second day and that's why we're not  getting them?  Yeah, when's punchline day?  Give us their show tomorrow and we'll probably hear all the funny stuff that is supposed to  be at the tail end of all this shit.  These bits are self-contained.  Paul in Florida vignettes.  These bits are self-contained.  Paul in Florida, go ahead.  I was wondering if you guys were able to play Ron's phone calls that he has from Brett Favre. 
[02:26:30]  Everyone is talking about Ronnie B doing his Brett Favre.  What's that about?  Do we have a sample of that?  Ronnie B does Brett Favre impression?  Everyone's talking about how great it is.  Let's steal some Ron and Fez bits.  Why not?  We're checking.  Come on.  Ron did some pretty funny bits.  Try to find an hour of Ron and Fez bits for us.  Yeah, come on an hour.  An hour?  I mean...  An hour?  What?  It's topical.  I'd love that.  You know, we still have a lot of stuff to do.  There's a lot of people talking about Ronnie doing Brett Favre, so now we've got to find  something.  It's very funny.  I'm sure it's into that. 
[02:27:00]  Can we get a sample of it?  I mean, we don't...  All right, when you guys figure it out, let me know.  Thank you, Paul.  Thanks for bringing that to our attention.  We should break so we can get Vic Henley in.  Is he here yet?  Yes, he is.  Okay.  Quick break.  Vic Henley next.  Stay there.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ah.  A lot of Aussie. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, I don't know why we got a lot of Aussie today.  And by a lot, I only identified two.  All right.  Got a full house.  We got, where's Vic Henley?  Where's Jim Norton?  Where's everybody?  They're chatting.  They're chatting.  I know Vic Henley.  How are you, sir?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  First time here, thank you very much.  I know.  No problem, brother.  Absolutely ever.  And that's Dr. Steve in the corner. 
[02:28:00]  So if you got any weird shit on you, he'll diagnose you right now, sir.  I'm totally healthy, a little tired.  A little tired?  That's about it.  Maybe it's sort of over-caffeinated a hair and a little tired at the same time.  But other than that, all my kidneys are functioning perfectly.  But you don't have any weird bumps or nothing?  Nothing.  No moles.  I just had a man look at me naked two or three months ago for the whole skin thing.  That's always fun, isn't it?  For the skin thing.  Was it a doctor?  Yes.  No, it was just a man.  It was just a man on 43rd Street near a newsstand over there.  You had a raincoat.  He looked official.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't got to tell me.  My skin doctor's really hot. 
[02:28:30]  Mine's not.  And she lifted my ball bag and everything.  Yeah, he did mine, too.  I'm like, you really have to look under the ball bag for skin cancer?  Why were you complaining?  Well, all right.  No, I'm not complaining, but.  Mine's a weird guy who looks like he's got too much work done.  Really?  Yeah.  Probably has.  So.  Yeah.  And then when I was on my belly, she was like, yeah, it's good enough.  Did she get in there?  Yeah, no.  She's like, yeah, it's good enough.  That's what I'm getting at.  But she had no problem lifting up the ball bag.  But she didn't, like, pull the cheeks apart.  Make sure there's no skin cancer hiding in there.  Maybe she got a waft. 
[02:29:00]  Well, you got to look for the mole on the taint.  That's what you always have to be aware of.  The mole.  Well, I just wanted to say mole on the taint.  And you don't want that.  I don't think you wouldn't want that.  Dr. Steve, you wouldn't want that, right?  A mole on your taint.  That might be some type of.  He's deaf and blind.  You all right, Steve?  He's deaf and blind.  He doesn't have a mic.  I'm asking him questions and he doesn't have a mic.  You can hear us, though, right?  I'm the ass.  Okay, you can hear us.  Yeah, he's got headphones.  At one point, I didn't think he was listening.  Are there areas on the body, Dr. Steve, that are a little more common for dangerous moles? 
[02:29:30]  Like, I would think the taint.  You don't hear a lot of...  You're not tanning your taint.  Like, taintectomy.  Right, right, right.  Taint is probably not in the sun a lot.  Yeah, sun-exposed areas tend to be more at risk.  Shoulders.  Shoulders, face.  Yeah.  But melanoma can show up anywhere, and so that's why they have to look everywhere.  What do you mean, hey, happy Thursday, everyone.  Yeah, what do you mean, anywhere?  Well, that's why they have to look under your ball bag. 
[02:30:00]  Can you get skin cancer on your ball peg?  Absolutely.  Anywhere there's skin, I would gather.  That skin's pretty tough.  It seems like it could handle some skin cancer.  Oh, God, stop that.  It's a little leathery down there, so it would punch it off.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  You ain't coming out of here now.  Get out of here.  I'll flick you up to some soft belly skin.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  You could sacrifice 20 layers of fucking scrotum skin before it really starts getting to you.  Oh, I don't want to think about that. 
[02:30:30]  Vic Henley's going to be at Bridge Street Live, Collinsville, Connecticut, this Friday, right?  That's outside of Hartford, yes.  I'm there with...  What is Louis Black's comedy cruise?  Louis Black decided...  Isn't that that gay thing?  Yes, it is.  Rosie O'Donnell's going to be there, Anne Heche.  Oh, right, Rosie.  I get Rosie and Louis confused all the time.  Louis Black is doing gay cruises now?  He decided, I don't know, I was hammered with him on St. Paddy's Day.  He told me about this thing and said, hey, do you want to go?  He's got John Panette, Susie Essman, Kathleen Madigan, a whole bunch of people more famous 
[02:31:00]  than me.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  But they're on there, and I think they needed someone to carry the bags.  Nice.  You have to do a part is you could walk into a Vic Henley discussion at any moment and  hear a hammered.  That's the beautiful part.  That's true.  There usually is alcohol involved somewhere.  You like your drink, sir?  I'm sure of tequila.  Tequila is your drink of choice.  Right, right, right.  So I sort of nurse a beer and sip tequila.  Yeah, there's no way.  God bless you.  I don't know anybody that drank tequila past like 30.  Right, right.  I'm 67.  I was just going to say, unless you're 25. 
[02:31:30]  It's a hard 20.  I'm sticking with it.  I rode hard and put up with it.  Tequila was always the drink that made me end up waking up on the bathroom floor.  Like, I'd go home, and this is, you know, my friends were hanging out in the woods because  he couldn't drink in bars.  One guy had his Jack Daniels, the other guy had the fucking Jose Cuervo.  Then you drink tequila, go home, vomit, and wake up with, like, that, you know, where  am I?  Sweaters on your teeth.  Yeah, yeah.  You got the tile mark of the bathroom floor. 
[02:32:00]  Grout is in your cheek.  Nothing better than that cool porcelain, though, when you're really feeling sweaty and clammy  and you get the right combo.  It's, like, better than the cold pillow when you're sleeping.  It really is.  I have to lay there sometimes with a wet rag on my head and just fucking fan myself.  Hangovers suck.  Dr. Steve, is there any way, and I know there's a lot of these cure-alls for hangovers, is  there anything that really works, and not to maybe completely eliminate it, but at least  make it a little better?  Well, the key is prevention. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, but that's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Best cure for hangovers, Alcoholics Anonymous.  A wake-up call is the best cure.  Prevention.  Of course, prevention.  You and your stupid prevention.  Shut up.  I got to tell you, I'm thinking by prevention, you're saying pre, like, fucking till the soil  before you plant the booze.  Exactly.  Staying well hydrated the night of drinking.  You can take a little ibuprofen before you go to bed, and you tend to wake up with less 
[02:33:00]  of the inflammatory effects.  Now, there's no dangers between the ibuprofen and the alcohol with the liver, like there  is Tylenol.  With Tylenol.  Yeah, I'd avoid Tylenol with alcohol.  Yeah, I don't like that Tylenol stuff.  Ibuprofen is a little harder on your stomach, but it's easier on your liver.  I always liked Excedrin.  Yes.  For some reason, that aspirin-caffeine combination, wow, would just kick that fucking headache's  ass.  Yep.  So, eating, does eating help, too? 
[02:33:30]  Eating and drinking tends to lead to emesis or vomiting.  Emesis.  Sounds like a black girl's name.  Absolutely.  Head to your leader.  Head to your leader.  Also, portion control will help, right?  Portion control, yes.  Absolutely.  Dinner or the drinking?  The drinking.  Portion control.  Yeah, is it wrong I like to drink vodka and goulash?  Goulash.  Bad combo.  Hungarian goulash.  Wow.  Hungarian with the smoked paprika. 
[02:34:00]  That's got to look exactly the same in the bowl as it did in your bowl.  It's terrible.  On your plate is what I was going to say.  Are you a puker or no?  It's got to take a lot for me to get sick.  I do what he does.  I'll drink water all night long.  I'll be about to fall down weaving drunk, and I'll be still chugging like a two-liter thing.  You'll still be well hydrated.  Yes, exactly.  I get upset seeing people drink water when we're out drinking.  I don't drink.  I go like, I'm like, and I know it's the good thing to do, but I'm like, ah.  You don't alter it?  I'm drinking.  Beer, water, beer, water.  No.  Just keep hydrated.  Beer, beer, beer, beer. 
[02:34:30]  Not as Steve pointed at me.  He knows I know.  But it's true.  That would be the good thing to do.  But it takes up room that beer could be going into.  Anthony actually drinks beer through a sponge to get that idiotic water out of it.  Just the alcohol.  Siphons it like an alcoholic with shoe polish through a loaf of bread.  Whose truck do you think that is with the water?  It's for faggot's bumper sticker.  Dick Kelly doesn't puke.  Anthony pukes from time to time.  From time to time.  It's very rare. 
[02:35:00]  It still does the puke day.  But the thing is, I do not puke at the night of drinking.  And Dr. Steve, I like having you here, because I can look at you and say, Dr. Steve, I can puke.  Not can puke.  I will puke usually 12 to 15 hours after I wake up hungover the next morning.  No, I'll lay there and be like, oh, wow, I think I skated this one.  I think I'm okay.  Watch a ball game.  I think I'm good.  Everything's fine.  Have some lunch.  I can't just fall off the fucking cliff. 
[02:35:30]  Do you sleep on your belly at least?  I'm all over the place.  Oh, Jesus.  My room has to be 67 degrees.  I put the air conditioner in 67.  And then I regulate my body temperature by moving the blanket over and over.  It's like a fucking, you know, trap door.  Super darkness.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Elvis, Elvis, aluminum foil on the window.  Sickness, water, bottle of water.  I do drink water after I'm done with my drinking.  And then a cold rag on the head.  But it could go on for hours and hours. 
[02:36:00]  I'll just be laying there with a headache.  And then it'll hit me.  Oh, I got to puke.  And it's like a day after I drank.  Sure.  What the fuck is up with that?  Is that healthy, Dr. Steve?  Is that healthy?  It's when your body distributes the alcohol as much as humanly possible and then gets rid of it.  It's a good thing he's in here.  We're learning a lot medically.  We really are.  We're breaking new ground.  But Vick Henley, you should both be dead.  Vick Henley, don't hold back.  I mean, if you've got your weird questions, he'll answer them. 
[02:36:30]  That's his specialty.  I don't have the weird medicine and horrible wine.  That's what this guy does.  I just want to know about that whole thing, though, of getting sick so much later.  Well, here's what happens when you drink alcohol.  It's broken down.  It's broken down in the liver.  Of course you do.  And you get a fat girl and you treat her like a person.  Start listening.  You ate to escape the pain, did you?  Exactly.  Stop doing it.  I'm listening.  Please.  Open up.  Suck this piggy.  Now get out. 
[02:37:00]  Hoof it home, fat cell.  Hoof it home.  I love it.  Steve.  So it's broken down to a substance from ethyl alcohol to something called acetaldehyde.  Now, acetaldehyde is very toxic to the system.  Very toxic.  Another enzyme will break it down from there into something that's a little more benign.  Now, some people have a delayed conversion from acetaldehyde to this other substance.  Oh, shit.  That's probably me, right? 
[02:37:30]  The people who tend to have the really rip-roaring hangovers, and then you'll get the delayed  reaction because that acetaldehyde is hanging around, and it attacks this thing in the  brain called the central chemoreceptor zone.  I don't like that attack.  That's good.  Jimmy goes, that's good.  Your chemoreceptor zone is getting the shit kicked out of it 24 hours later.  By acetaldehyde.  By acetaldehyde.  Your chemoreceptor zone is getting its ass kicked by acetaldehyde.  An MMA fight going on in my head.  Right.  Absolutely. 
[02:38:00]  Exactly.  Something bizarre.  That chemoreceptor zone is supposed to detect poison, and it'll make you puke to get rid  of the poison.  Right, to get rid of the poison.  So, since it's hanging around, it just says, well, fuck, I got to make this guy puke.  Is there any way to zap that and get rid of it?  Well, again, portion control and prevention.  But there are some medications that you can take, and there are people who recommend  activated charcoal after a binge.  Like eating it?  Why are you encouraging him to make his hangovers easier? 
[02:38:30]  Exactly.  That's the last thing that's keeping you alive.  Exactly.  Your body is safe.  Dr. Steve's there like, ah, we can get around that for you.  That's wonderful, Dr. Steve.  Just eat a brick cat.  A brick cat.  I hope you know how to do it, precious, Dr. Steve.  Crumble up some Kingsford.  And stir it up until it dissolves and just choke it down like Rocky in the morning.  Put it down in some vodka.  Absolutely.  You might want to suck on the Yule log like it's a giant cock.  Crack open your Brita filter and just gargle with it.  Just gargle with the Brita filter. 
[02:39:00]  Holy mother of God.  We don't want you to help him out on this one.  All right.  Yeah, eat charcoal.  That's a great suggestion.  It's weird medicine.  I mean, I'm learning things here.  I'm not going to do it.  I think the portion control is best.  Yeah.  And the hydration, if you keep yourself well hydrated, it keeps those toxins diluted.  Diluted, right?  Diluted.  By the way, anybody capable of portion control would never ask a question.  Good point, Jim.  Portion control.  I have three kegs in my house now. 
[02:39:30]  Do you really?  Seriously?  Yeah.  That was the advice.  I thought that was bad.  Really?  Tell me where you live.  I'm coming by.  This is like...  He's got a bar in his house.  They're like, it's a full bar.  The Budweiser guy comes by and...  Yeah, the guy comes with the hand trunks.  He's a regular stop.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So like you and George Jones are the only people...  Yeah, George Jones.  Old country legend George Jones.  George Jones.  Right.  When you have more kegs in your house than George Jones.  One Guinness.  One Guinness.  Okay.  And a Bud Light next to each other.  And that's in the bar in the house. 
[02:40:00]  But during the summer, that walk all the way downstairs to the bar and all the way up to the pool was getting a little rough.  So another Bud Light keg went into the cabana.  So now you can just go right in there.  Do you have a cabana boy?  Do you have a cabana boy?  Not that I know of.  You're sitting next to him.  I was going to say.  What's the use of having a cabana if at least once a summer you can't go, cabana boy?  Cabana boy.  And then someone runs out.  He just goes around and like play 80s music lighting firecrackers.  Give Vic Henley the big invite, Dan. 
[02:40:30]  He wants to drink beers with you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sure.  This Vic Henley's a big star.  I like Guinness.  I like Guinness.  You like the Guinness?  The Bud Light.  I don't really know about the Bud Light thing.  Bud Light is one of those, you know.  It's one of those beers with no beer in it.  I'm not arguing with you.  During the summer, if you're outside.  I make up in quantity, though.  Of course you can.  You can drink 67 of them.  But the quality of the beer.  If it's nice and warm out and you're out by the pool, a few Guinness, and it's a little heavy.  You start, you know.  Not really.  Not if it's cold enough.  Taking on a lot of ballast.  I think it's cold enough.  Well, that's the point, too.  My brother does this.  He drinks Miller Line. 
[02:41:00]  He'll drink 483 of them right around on a pontoon boat.  Yeah, you just can sit there and just...  You know, all summer long with his American flag tennis shoes on.  That's what he does, totally.  I guess you're from the north.  That's exactly Connecticut.  Late country.  Late country Connecticut.  That's where I'm playing.  I can tell.  We go out and look at the bald eagles.  I was watching some of your acts.  I apologize for that.  Sorry about that.  No, very funny.  We love it.  Because to tell you the truth, I heard the name and I'm like, I know the name, got to 
[02:41:30]  put it with the face.  And then a video came up instead of just a picture.  And that thing with the KKK line.  Oh, that's a good story.  Well, I don't mind that.  I scared him to death at Comedy Central putting that in my special because I changed it at the  11th hour.  Oh, really?  And you go in a meeting, you're sitting around a big round table, and your last little segment  there, they had all these horrible worst jokes that I was going to do.  So you're sitting there, and I'm like, oh, we have one change.  I'm like, cross all that out and just put in Klan story.  And there's like 11 people sitting around the big long table, and they're like, well,  do it for us.  And I'm like, well, I'm not going to do my act at this table for 11 people. 
[02:42:00]  It's sad enough in front of big crowds.  I'm not going to.  Just trust me.  It's not dirty or anything.  It's fine.  It's Klan story.  And I just leave.  I leave the meeting.  They called me between that afternoon and the next night when we taped it.  I got 11 different phone calls up the producer chain.  What is this?  And I'm like, it's not a pro Klan story.  Just get that.  I know you hear the accent.  Don't get scared.  Throwing the N-bomb out.  That's what they really thought.  They really thought.  They had it all.  And it wasn't until I walked off stage getting a big hand that the main director guy walks 
[02:42:30]  over, and he goes, oh, Klan story.  That was great.  That was really funny.  But it wasn't good.  They were a nervous wreck until the 11th hour.  They really thought I was going to say the N-word.  And like Howard Stern's going, wake up, white people.  Like that guy from back in the day.  They really thought it was.  When did you tape?  Oh, God.  05, I think.  Oh, okay.  I feel like there's a new one.  No, no.  Oh, we got to play it now.  Maybe we play it when we end the show today.  It's long, yes.  How long is it?  It's like four minutes long.  Oh, we like long.  We were hoping you were going to say 35 minutes.  Yeah, actually, 34 minutes, 15 seconds would be out. 
[02:43:00]  Four minutes.  That's not long, sir.  And then we're going to back it up with Mountain Jam by the Allman Brothers.  Exactly.  Yeah, we don't play music here.  Four minutes is not long enough for us.  Oh, that's good.  Hey, I'm trying to think if there's any.  The bad part of the Klan story is everyone asks me, there's four people in the car.  It's about a bunch of buddies of mine.  We went to see Kiss in concert.  So that's a white trash classic, just with those facts right there.  And everybody always asks me down through the years, like, what happened to everybody?  And I'm like, two of them are dead, crackheads. 
[02:43:30]  And they're like, oh, we don't want to know that.  And I'm like, don't ask me a goddamn question.  It is true.  You lost two friends to crack?  Yeah, the main guy in the story turned into a crackhead, and a drug dealer stole his car over drugs.  He went and took to confront the drug dealer and was killed.  That's what you always want to do, is go to the hood and get a pistol.  Yes, because they're going to probably confess.  Once you confront them, they believe in therapeutic solutions.  They sit down, they write.  They write back and forth the talking stick and get it all worked out.  It's like quarters.  Do they have something called a talking stick? 
[02:44:00]  You didn't know about this?  You didn't know about the talking stick?  I would kill my girlfriend with a fucking blickered teeth with a fist.  It's like a shillelagh.  Buford Pusser had one.  Yes, he did, by God.  American hero.  A talking stick.  Whenever I hear Buford Pusser, I only think of when I was in high school and Walking Tall came out,  and it played for 36 weeks in the theater in the town I lived in.  And we were just madder than shit because we just wanted to see a new movie.  As teenagers, you know, we're just in one movie theater in town,  and just every day we're like, God damn it, not this shit again. 
[02:44:30]  Come on.  You know, God, that brings back memories.  I didn't even realize that.  They got from Tennessee.  The mayor of the town I'm from is mayor on his, like, seventh term,  and one of the reasons he first won 28 years ago is because, you know,  he used to know Buford Pusser up in Tennessee.  Oh, well.  That's all it took.  Vote him right in.  That's all it took.  I remember the local dumb movie theater, and there was no multiplex or anything like that.  It was one movie theater.  They would play the same movie for fucking months on end.  And it was because, I think it was because once it left the movie theater,  you weren't seeing that fucking thing until it ended up on TV like years later. 
[02:45:00]  That was the only place you could see movies.  Jesus, how old are we?  So that was it.  So I remember for months, it's like, oh, Kelly's Heroes is still there.  Still, right, right, right.  They tried to rotate it in and out.  We were between Birmingham and Atlanta, so I think we were on the main track for a week.  Drop a new one off.  They're ready for Smokey and the Bandit.  Smokey and Bandit 3 was the worst, because that was the one Burt Reynolds just said. 
[02:45:30]  No, Jerry Reed was the entire Bandit guy.  Dressed up like Burt Reynolds and took the Trans Am and ruined that franchise.  I was in a big country show with a bunch of these guys years ago, 
[02:46:00]  and Jerry Reed was notoriously dickish and standoffish.  And I just wanted to talk to him, and everybody was like, leave him alone.  And I saw him by himself, and I just walked over and I'm like,  ever since the Academy snubbed you for Best Supporting Actor,  that's Cleetus Snow the Snowman.  I have never watched the Oscars.  He laughed and like talked to me for a few minutes and actually wasn't an asshole.  I sat there forever agonizing over, how am I going to go with this?  I've got to come up with something that was scary.  But he was a real dick to people?  He was a real dick to people.  He was all snotty, and he worked with puppets. 
[02:46:30]  His act was horrible.  He had puppets.  He had puppets on stage and sang this song.  He used to have a bad variety show back in the 70s when everybody had one,  like a summer replacement series.  We were making fun of those.  It was like, with the announcer, that would go,  Well, it's the Dairy Raid Show!  Right, exactly.  What channel?  Right, exactly.  And the announcer had to yell.  And he'd come out to, When you're hot, you're hot.  When you're hot, you're hot.  When you're not, you're not.  You know, and I saw that on stage, a traveling version.  It had puppets and little kids and mandolins.  It was totally weird. 
[02:47:00]  Did he do the streak?  No, it's Ray Stevens.  Ray Stevens.  Ray Stevens.  He did Ahab the A-Rab.  That's Ray Stevens, Ahab the A-Rab.  I used to laugh so hard as a boy to that song.  You want to hear it?  No, the streak.  Want to hear it or what, Jimmy?  A moment of it, not the whole dumb song.  Guitar Zan was his first one.  Guitar Zan.  Guitar Zan and his jungle band.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What was the other one he did?  The streak?  He did Ahab the A-Rab.  He had another one.  And then he had the big hit where it was like,  Everything is Beautiful, the soft one.  Yeah, with the gospel choir. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, gospel choir.  Everything is Beautiful.  Yeah, and all of a sudden it was like,  Why is this comedy joke song guy doing this song?  Then he had Misty.  Now we've gone through the whole Ray Stevens catalog.  I celebrate his entire catalog.  That was it.  I used to pretend I was him singing the streak, though.  I thought I was very funny.  Were you naked?  No, I didn't know what it meant.  Naked as a jay bird.  There he is.  Right.  Running through the pole, baby.  Wait, it's got an intro? 
[02:48:00]  Hello, everyone.  This is your action.  Oh, yeah, this is the video of this.  Wow.  Oh, God.  I forgot about this.  At the supermarket, there seems to have been some disturbance here.  I think there was a video.  Yeah, totally.  What happened?  Yeah, I did.  As you're standing over there by the tomatoes and Gary Cump,  running through the pole beans.  Through the fruits and veggies, naked as a jay bird.  Ethel's over there in the jams, jellies, preserves, and pickles.  I hollered over there.  I said, Don't look, Ethel!  Oh, she dropped a whole jar of kumquats and failed back into the sweet midget side. 
[02:48:30]  Wait, is this a newer version?  It's a new remake.  He's covered himself.  What the laughs?  He's covered himself.  Yeah, that sucks.  I want the original.  The show's going to get more crowded.  We've got Steve-O coming in.  Oh, dear?  In a minute or so, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  We kind of overbooked today.  We've got way too much going on.  Steve-O was last minute, but he's in town, so.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck, yeah.  The Jackass 3D is out, so he's there pimping that all over the planet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw some of the clips.  It looks hilarious.  It does look hilarious. 
[02:49:00]  It's no streak.  No, it's no Ahab the A-Rab.  Too drunk to fish, Ray Stevie.  The A-Rab.  I don't know that one.  That's great.  Get away with that.  I think that was another one of those songs.  Oh, that fucking...  That fucking...  Ethel!  I forgot about Ethel.  Ethel!  Don't look, Ethel!  Oh, God.  Just horrible stuff.  Is this the original?  I hope so.  They're just showing somebody playing a 45?  Well, it's YouTube.  Yeah, you gotta have some visual. 
[02:49:30]  I guess you gotta have some visual.  Could it just fuck?  All right, we get it.  The record's dropping.  Fuck.  45, that was what I had.  You're right.  I actually own this.  That's sarcophagus.  Hello, everyone.  This is your action news reporter with all the news that is news across the nation on  the scene at the supermarket.  There seems to have been some disturbance here.  Oh, God.  Pardon me, sir.  Did you see what happened?  Yeah, I did.  How many times has he done that?  Here he comes.  Yeah, I did.  How many times did he have to go, yeah, I did.  Naked as a jaybird.  Hey, we gotta say hi to Steve-O.  Fuck the Ray Stevens. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, but I was having a few laughs.  What's up, Steve-O?  Where are you?  Sit over.  I can sit up there, Dr. Steve.  You could sit there, Dr. Steve.  I was standing up for Steve-O.  Look how fucking healthy Steve-O is.  Steve-O looks great.  Holy shit.  It's not even the same guy.  You still sober?  Yeah.  He looks it.  You fucking look it.  Yeah.  I don't even know how to talk to you this way.  He's wondering who the fuck we are.  You two know you've done our show many times, right, Steve-O? 
[02:50:30]  Of course.  Of course.  Okay.  All right.  Wow, man.  Fuck yeah, dudes.  Wow, man.  Steve-O looks fucking good.  Yeah, look at you.  Thank you, man.  You look very healthy.  The hair.  I saw Steve-O the other night.  We bumped into each other.  We were out.  And we talked for a few minutes.  So I was like, this is not the same fucking guy.  No.  While I was on stage at the Gene Simmons roast, and I turned around, he was gone.  Like, oh, we had a thing.  He had to leave.  A thing.  Steve-O had to leave.  Had a thing.  And so what, we don't, you know, have you for that long, obviously.  But what?  Hey, you know, I'm not in a wrench.  You guys are our friends, and fuck everyone else. 
[02:51:00]  Nice.  I like the way you think.  Right.  Steve-O used to sleep in our hallways and stuff.  We'd go way back.  That's true, man.  Well, did you give him a blanket?  Were there any cushions, nothing on the floor?  He showed up early once, and all of a sudden, he's like, he's cool.  He said he's going to take a nap, and he was just sleeping in the hallway for like an hour.  Yeah.  That sounds about right.  Do you remember this stuff?  I don't remember it, but I sure don't have trouble believing it.  Hey, so I was talking to Jim the other night, and I've been doing stand-up comedy lately,  and I'm having a blast. 
[02:51:30]  Awesome.  And I need to find a place here in New York City to get up and do a set tomorrow night.  I'm talking about like 15 minutes.  That should be easy.  There has to be one of the clubs that'll put him on, yeah.  Of course.  That should be easy.  Yeah, that'll be rad.  What do we call?  Yeah.  I told Steve-O to check the cellar to check who's at Caroline's headlining, because it  depends on the headliner.  Is it John Witherspoon?  All right.  I called up and left a message and said, hey, I got a big-time movie coming out, and  I'm funnier than fucking shit. 
[02:52:00]  John Witherspoon's crowd.  I don't know if that's your crowd.  That could be a problem.  Probably a good point, yeah.  Could be a problem.  But also, comics.  There's comics down in...  Comics would put you up in a cellar.  Yeah, I think comics might.  What about a place that someone said, a place called The Studio?  The Comic Strip might put it.  Whatever it is.  If anybody's listening right now, how do we do this?  You know, like...  Comics might be a good show.  I'm going to get a hold of the opening of the show.  Call...  Like, Jim's got my number.  Like, I'm really serious about this. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, get a hold of, like, what the fuck?  What about Standom New York?  We can find out, too.  Kenny might have...  Because Steve had all the contacts.  We have to have somebody with all the contacts.  I'm talking to Steve's guy.  I'll take care of him.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Fuck yes.  We're going to have a set tonight.  Everybody come out, man.  Fucking Lurch will hook you up.  Yeah, come out.  We'll have a blast.  It's so awesome, man.  You know, Jackass 3D, it's so important to me.  It's been so important to me to prove that sobriety hasn't turned me into a boring, lame pussy.  And, like, you know, and so, like, is it easier to film a Jackass movie sober? 
[02:53:00]  Like, not at all.  But, you know, it's maybe a little tougher, you know?  Right.  But it's so important to me, like I said, to prove that I still have it in me, that even  though I'm dreading all this stuff more than ever, like, I'm also, like, more eager than  ever to do it, you know?  Yeah, you must have been...  I have a lot more, you know, obviously courage comes with the booze, so, like, you would just...  Or drugs, you'd hop in a fucking port-a-john with a bungee cord, and you wouldn't think  twice about it.  Now you've got to have a certain anxiety level, I would think. 
[02:53:30]  And it just makes for great footage.  Yeah.  It really makes, like, I'm in this new movie, I'm in Jackass 3D more than either of the  two before.  Really?  Yeah.  You look petrified when that fucking...  I was going to say, the honest is pure honesty.  If he's totally terrified.  That's good.  And then the other thing I just recently saw in one of the trailers, you guys play fucking  tetherball in your underwear with a, like, hornet's nest or a bee's nest?  You're sick as a fucking thing, dude. 
[02:54:00]  Totally.  It looks sick.  You're getting stung like crazy.  That beehive tetherball was great.  Beehive tetherball.  It's something that's like, I got it wrong, like, when we were filming it, you know, I  said, you know, like, Manny the Shark Man was there, he says, it takes a hundred bee  stings to kill a man.  Oh, sure.  And these are, like, Africanized...  Unless you're allergic, it takes one.  These are Africanized, like, killer bees or whatever, you know, like, and Manny says,  it takes, like, a hundred stings to kill a man. 
[02:54:30]  And I was like, dude, like...  So the director says, well, we'll get 99 and then take off.  And they got an intern counting.  There's an intern sitting off camera somewhere going 78, 79, 80.  Yeah, but my reaction, I think they showed in the trailer, too, Manny says it's a hundred  to kill a guy.  And I go, but dude, we have 50,000 bees.  I was mistaken.  We had 350,000 bees.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it was, it was, like...  Obviously, they don't have lawyers, right?  350,000 bees? 
[02:55:00]  We had 350,000 bees.  Where were you?  How were you playing this?  We were, we were in, uh, we were, we were in Orlando.  Dude, it's sick.  There's a pole with, like, a rope and a fucking giant bees nest on it.  And then they're smacking it.  With their hands?  With their hands, yeah.  They're just smacking it and fucking getting stung and smacking it.  It's hysterical.  And I remember, too, like, I remember that they hadn't assigned anybody.  And they're like, hey, so who wants Beehive Tetherball?  I'm, like, jumping up and down.  Like, me, me, me, me. 
[02:55:30]  Like, uh, it was great, man.  Like, the first thing you see me do in the movie, I'm standing there getting ready to  be hit in the balls with a baseball.  Like a baseball.  And, uh, and, and, you know, it's just, like, you know, really, it's evident that I'm  just dreading it because, you know, I introduce the bit.  I say, I'm Steve-O.  I mean, all I have to say is, I'm Steve-O and this is T-Ball.  And what comes out of me is, I'm Steve-O.  Why do I have to be Steve-O?  You know, again, really honest. 
[02:56:00]  Wearing a cup?  No cup, nothing.  Free ball, T-Ball.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Yeah.  And, uh, man, it was great.  There's so, there's so much good stuff.  Have you seen it in 3-D?  I have, man.  Yeah, you see it in 3-D right away because we actually had the integrity to shoot it in  3-D.  Right.  Integrity?  Yeah, that's exactly what we have.  And I would say that jackass is what 3-D is made for, man.  You know?  And technology finally caught up to us and we took full advantage of it, man. 
[02:56:30]  Like, it's just, it's fucking awesome, man.  Like, do you guys, do you know what a phantom camera is?  It shoots a thousand frames per second?  Ah, it's like fucking fast.  It's great, man.  It's great.  You can get some ultra slow motion.  All the stuff that the naked eye can't see, like, uh, hi, Lady Gaga.  So if I didn't...  Is that a Halloween costume?  There's a little black girl dressed like Lady Gaga.  That doesn't make sense.  Holy shit.  I only got 8,000 jokes I can't say. 
[02:57:00]  Goblins and that hype.  But, uh, so, yeah, we had the world's first 3-D phantom camera custom built for us.  And, like, just, like, all kinds of stuff that the naked eye just doesn't see, like,  that you wouldn't even know about.  Like, we're, like, scientists.  Like, revealing.  We're, like, scientists.  It's what it is.  It's like science, man.  Like, you know, well, would this work, you know?  And, like, we fucking find out, you know?  That's what I think about.  I think of Steve-O.  I think Thomas Edison.  You know, Copernicus. 
[02:57:30]  There's another thing I saw in the trailer.  It looked like, um, because the things go by really quick in the trailer.  It looked like someone's laying down.  Fucking airplane flies over him and drops something.  Oh, they showed that in the trailer?  Yeah, yeah.  Incredible nut shots.  Now, who is that on the ground?  That was Chris Panius.  Okay, so it's Chris.  And the...  I don't understand how anyone gives permission for any of this shit.  Because the plane is fucking, like, 15 feet in the air. 
[02:58:00]  Right, right, right, right.  And dropping something and trying to hit Chris with something dropped out of the plane.  You know, we've been at it for a while.  That's actually...  I'm surprised that that would be in a trailer because that's...  It's real fast.  That's going to be in, um, Jackass 3.5.  Oh, wow.  Like, we shot two movies worth of stuff.  Oh, nice.  Jesus.  And, like, you know, the best stuff goes into the movie in theaters.  So, um, just to, like, to illustrate, like, how rad this movie is.  I got, um, it's, like, burns up the entire left side of my body. 
[02:58:30]  Hospitalized with, with, with all these burns.  Like, the whole left side of my body.  I got my nose, like, like, like, horribly broken by Bam Margera.  I got, uh, I got a copper BB fired sideways through my nipple with a high-powered BB gun.  My nipple's a mess.  And then the BB's still in there.  And none of that shit made the movie.  It's all in 3.1.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  My nipple's a mess. 
[02:59:00]  It's a fucking mess, man.  You don't get to say that a lot as a guy.  No.  As a guy, you hardly ever get to say that.  It's an absolute disaster.  That's fucked.  Steve, what, what was like, uh, what was your, your, I mean, I think we've seen it,  but what was your bottom where you said, I gotta fucking get straight, man?  You know, um, it, I, I had my intervention.  Johnny Knox came and, and, uh, with the, with the guys, the crew.  That was amazing to watch, by the way.  They stepped, they stepped in, you know, like, uh.  Did you resent them at the time for doing that? 
[02:59:30]  Maybe a little bit.  I, I, I was, uh, a little bit.  Here, let me just show you my, my, my sad, broken nose picture.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's, yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.  You look like Barry McGuigan.  You look really sad.  Oh, my God.  Right?  It's like Barry McGuigan.  It's like Forrest Griffin.  The most unskilled MMA fighter ever.  Oh, shit, you fucked up.  Your nose is completely twisted.  Right.  It's way over to the side there.  By the way, I got a text from Keith.  Straighten that out.  I got a text from Keith Mareska.  Esty said, no problem. 
[03:00:00]  Get his people her number.  That's the comedy seller.  Oh, nice.  There you go.  Bang.  There you go.  Oh, man.  You guys got to come out.  It'll be a fucking blast.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Then you're going to have to go up to the table and sit with the comics and let them  rip your ass apart.  That's right.  That's what it's all about.  If you're doing the seller, that's what it's all about.  Yeah, bring it on, man.  Wow, that's a fucked up nose.  Did you explain how you fucked up your nose?  It was, it was Bam.  Oh, you said Bam broke it.  Yeah, Bam broke it.  Hitting you with something? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  He snuck up behind me, fucking punched, sucker punched me with his fucking,  uh, his, his trick, you know, like he throws the water in your face with one hand and then  punches you in the face with the other hand, you know, like, so that the, the, the, the,  the 1000 frame per second, like a slow-mo camera can see like all the water coming off the face.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the whole face comes off your skull and shit.  So he did that.  And like, oh man, I was so fucking pissed.  I was like, dude, you broke my nose.  I'm fucking like, you have the worst headache I've ever had in my life. 
[03:01:00]  I'm going to fucking mace you.  I'm going to fucking, I'm going to knock you down.  I'm going to fucking electrocute you all over the ground.  Then I'm going to kick you in the kidneys until they do you more fucking harm than good.  And you're fucking, you best be afraid, motherfucker, be afraid.  And then like, uh, you know, and, and, and Bam's like, like, then I'll say, I'm just stewing  in this resentment and I'm telling the director like what we need to do because, because we  can't send the message to little kids that you can just dish it out for 10 years and never  get it back.  I'm like, we have to fucking tie him up to a pole and fucking time lapse it and just give 
[03:01:30]  him his own medicine for an entire day.  And like, and then all of a sudden I'm like, okay, wait, this resentment's killing me.  Like, like, I'm not God.  I'm not the director of Jackass.  Like, it's not my job to deal with Bam's karma.  So I just let go.  And then two days later, Bam gets hit in the head with a baseball bat.  You know, I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad he's okay.  But I'd be lying if I said, I'm not glad that he got fucking hit in the head with a baseball 
[03:02:00]  bat.  Holy shit.  Because he's okay, you know.  But letting go of that ugly allowed you to fully celebrate, fully celebrate with no guilt  or anything.  That's so great.  You know, I said a quick prayer and thank God he was paralyzed.  Holy shit.  I've got to see this.  Oh yeah, it's going to be huge.  I have not been to any movie and I don't know how long, I can't stand going to the fucking  movie theater.  This is one movie I'm absolutely going to fucking see. 
[03:02:30]  It's fucking awesome, man.  And everyone that sees it, all of them, everyone's like, dude, this is your best one yet.  It's like.  And the past two have been great.  The second one, I fucking, I thought I was going to piss myself.  Yeah, it's great shit.  Fantastic.  Fucking funny shit.  The measure of it, the measure of like, of whether it's good or not, like anything we do, is  really if like we're all standing around laughing our asses off, you know, like if, if, if we're  shocked, if we're laughing, if like, you know, then we've got it covered, you know, like, you 
[03:03:00]  can't breathe after doing something because you're laughing so hard, you know, it's fucking  working.  And it takes a little more each time to make us laugh, you know.  Yeah, no shit.  How much did it, one of the craziest things I ever saw was that fucking crab that grabbed  you.  What was that giant?  Yeah, it was a coconut crab.  Holy fuck.  How would you do that?  It could cut through coconuts.  And it grabbed your ass?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the fucking wound.  I don't think that's as bad as an alligator snapping turtle we had when it was like.  Oh, God.  It was fucking big and we latched that thing on my ass. 
[03:03:30]  Really?  Yeah, that's like, that's in 3.5.  I was going to say, in hillbilly culture I'm from, they won't let go until it thunders.  That's what they said.  That's how far they won't let go until it thunders.  Yeah, that's called bayou butt piercing.  Good God.  God damn.  Yeah, because you did a lot of shit with animals in that Wild Boys series that you had.  Yeah, uh-huh.  And you know, since I've become, I'm really going to probably bum you guys out here, but 
[03:04:00]  like, I'm like, I'm 100% vegan now.  Not that it's a real bummer.  It's like a healthy thing to do, you know, but like, I'm 100% vegan.  I'm all about like, um, I got my rescue animals.  Yeah, I've got like two dogs I rescued, like, um.  Well, you got a lot of making up to do.  I do, man.  You got 300,000 bees you have to have thought.  I'm not so worried about bees.  Maybe I'm vegan.  I'm vegan.  Yeah, but yeah, I haven't had a drink or a drug stronger than ibuprofen in 31 months 
[03:04:30]  and four days.  Wow.  I haven't smoked a cigarette in over two years.  That's good, too.  Yeah, I even gave up fucking coffee, dude.  Wow.  If I can just stop jacking off to internet porn, you know, like, I could be a candidate for  cigarette.  Baby steps.  Baby steps.  Baby steps.  Yeah, I love talking about like that.  Is that a website?  Yes.  Yes, it is, actually.  Baby steps.  Yes, it is.  It's for pedophiles with foot fetishes.  It's called baby steps. 
[03:05:00]  Fucking Steve-O.  So rad, man.  So what was, I was getting into a little bit of it before.  What was it after the intervention that made you, because obviously you have to say, like,  I'm fucked.  Yeah, you can't make somebody want to get better.  These guys showed up in my pad.  It was eight guys.  It wasn't the kind of intervention where, like, the addict has, like, the choice of  yes or no.  Right.  You know, this was like, okay, we're taking you.  Like, we would be happy to kick your ass and tie you up and put you in the trunk, but  you're going, you know? 
[03:05:30]  And they meant it.  I'm not really a fighter, you know?  So, like, they got me.  They took me to the hospital.  I was locked up on the 51-50 hold, so I had no way.  I was so belligerent when I got there, they changed it to a 52-50 hold.  So, they had me for two weeks involuntary.  Wow.  And while I was in there, I remember, like, some people talking about sobriety, and that  kind of thought, man, you know, maybe you can do something, and I don't know.  And then all of a sudden, it just, like, kind of came to me.  I thought, dude, I'm Steve-O. 
[03:06:00]  You know, like, if I clean up my act, if I, you know, turn it around, if I learn how to  live clean and sober, like, the whole world will have to kiss my butt.  You know, like, I'm, like, I kind of run out of ways to get recognition, and I just  want to win.  This is, like, truly my motivation.  I was, like, dude, I'm in a position where I could do a lot of good in the world, you  know?  Like, I could really, like, help a lot of people, you know?  Like, because I'm Steve-O, you know?  Like, so I came up with the idea to do the world a great favor while on suicide watch 
[03:06:30]  and a psych watch.  And, like, and that's what it was.  So, I told him, I said, I'm ready to go to rehab.  Off, you know, off I went.  I went door to door.  Checked into rehab, and I was, like, my first three months of sobriety, I was more  arrogant and obnoxious than I had been on drugs.  Wow.  I was just, like, telling everybody, like, how great I was because I was leading by  example, you know?  Like, posting all my, like, rehab shit on the internet, you know?  Like, it was just horrible.  But I really did, like, take it seriously, and I did take suggestions. 
[03:07:00]  And, like, as part of, like, what suggested, like, I took an honest look at myself and my  actions.  And, like, at that point, I'd been sober for, like, three months.  And, like, really, honestly, like, the fog cleared enough for me to see, like, what a  douchebag I truly had become.  Wow.  And I got, like, totally, I felt like my actions were completely unforgivable, that I was just,  like, such a, like, a bad person, and I was just beating myself up and all, like, self-loathing.  And I went and, like, I was, like, felt suicidal. 
[03:07:30]  My friends took me to my second psych ward when I'd been sober for 100 days.  So I was in the second psych ward, 100 days sober, and I was writing in my journal.  I was writing suicidal thoughts and depression and, and can this really be exactly where  I'm supposed to be?  I'm in a freaking psych ward.  You know, like, and then I wrote, like, in the same little entry in my journal, I wrote,  this is what we call self-pity.  Fuck.  And I, like, I, like, kind of, like, called myself out. 
[03:08:00]  Like, I got honest with myself.  And I feel like at that point, when I was, like, 100, like, that was my bottom.  I was 100 days into sobriety.  That's odd, that, like, that far into it that you would then pick up, because, like  you said, the fog cleared.  Yeah, the fog cleared.  And in that second psych ward, I feel like it dawned on me that the rest of the world is  just fine, and it was me who needed the favor.  You know?  And that's where, like, the cart got behind the horse where it belongs.  You know what's fucked up, though?  Also, there's so much documentation of you being fucked up.  Right, right.  Like, is that hard for you to watch? 
[03:08:30]  You know, like, um...  Like the talk show appearance, the Adam Carolla.  I mean, the Adam Carolla appearance.  That's fine.  That didn't bother me, man.  That didn't bother me.  We did a lot of talk.  Child's play.  We actually loved that one.  Yeah, that was my purpose.  Like, they asked me to do it.  They said, what stunt are you going to do?  I said, what stunt are you going to do?  I said, what stunt are you going to do?  I'll tell you what, for your little basic cable show.  I'm like, how about I get to start as wasted as I possibly can?  We'll see what kind of a breathalyzer score I blow.  You know?  And, like, the breathalyzer was, like, in the green room, like, incessantly beeping, 
[03:09:00]  because I had broken it with, like, you know?  Like, literally just blew it.  Like, I was...  Holy shit.  They're saying he's got to go.  Iraq's driving me nuts with telling him he's got to go.  Oh, fuck you, Iraq.  What, you got a busy schedule there?  Yeah, he's got to.  You know, it's just the weirdest thing, the way greedy people are about money, you know?  I know, bastards.  But is it just hard to, like, watch yourself in certain situations?  You know, I tell you, man, you know, you were talking, I think, about the documentary about  my downward spiral.  It was amazing.  You know, that was difficult and uncomfortable. 
[03:09:30]  Great TV, though.  But not as difficult, as uncomfortable, by any stretch, as Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah, I bet.  I believe that, sure.  Dancing with the Stars was the fucking worst.  Yes, I can tell you.  Yeah, yeah.  I say every episode.  My wife will lure me in there, and every time I'll watch for 30 seconds and go, with  88 weeks of training, I could never fucking do that.  Ever.  I would fall down.  Yeah, it's bad, huh?  Yeah, it's bad.  But, you know, it is what it is, man.  Like, I was such a public mess. 
[03:10:00]  I fell apart so publicly.  Like, there's really, like, no way for me to be, like, sober and then have it be a secret,  you know?  Yeah, yeah.  And I'll say this.  Nobody can guarantee they're going to stay sober for the rest of their life.  My only guarantee is that if I don't stay sober, then I'm absolutely fucking screwed,  because I know that I would pick up where I left off.  Oh, man.  And where I left off, I had nothing left to do but die, man.  Like, bottom line, man.  I was at the end of the line.  So I can only, you know, it's, you know, like, one day at a time, like they say.  Yeah.  And today's a fucking great day. 
[03:10:30]  I'm super psyched to be here.  Dude, fucking great, man.  Congrats.  Right on.  Yeah.  You know, keep going.  And the movie's coming out Friday in theaters.  Right.  Jackass 3D.  Un-fucking-believable.  I gotta see this thing.  It looks great.  Jackass 3D was my, like, it was my quest to prove that sobriety has not turned me into  a fucking pussy.  Yeah.  And I don't think anyone's going to call me a pussy.  No, I don't think so.  And, like, you know, and I was doing stand-up comedy, like, I was fucking around with it,  like, four years ago, and I was loaded.  Like, I remember I'd come out and I'd say, I don't know if it's the amphetamines, the 
[03:11:00]  Xanax, the grass, or the booze, but I feel great.  And I was, like, telling the truth.  Like, whatever, like, we said.  Yeah.  Like, and it went, like, pretty well sometimes.  Like, it really went, like, really well a couple times.  And, like, other times were kind of disastrous.  And now, like, to compare that to, like, the stand-up I'm doing now, it's so much better  now.  So, like, again, like, it's for me to prove that, like, that sobriety hasn't made me 
[03:11:30]  less funny.  But, you know, I'm just so excited.  Thank you, Jim, for hooking that up.  Well, they're working out.  No, of course, man.  Getting down the way.  It's on.  So, so, so, so we're doing it at the Cellar.  Comedy Cellar.  It's on McDougal and West 3rd.  As he said, just to call her.  And Keith Mareska, I think, has her info, and we'll get that to you.  Cool, man.  Easy.  Keep the cop.  Brilliant.  So, okay, wait.  I'm sorry.  I'll tell you what.  I'll just get it after.  Thank you guys so much, man.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Steve.  Absolutely.  I did, like, what I remember of you guys.  Like, that entire, like, five-hour session with D. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yeah, with D and the cue ball on your head.  I did the fucking butt chug here.  The butt chug.  I did the butt chug for you guys at the curb.  Like, like, years before it was, like, before that was cool.  What was D's famous line we play all the time?  I don't know.  About the guy?  You, uh, you, uh, oh, I don't know.  Fucking a mule.  Well, you got a mule?  Mule?  I don't know what ever happened to her, man.  She was hot.  She was hot.  I worry about her a little bit. 
[03:12:30]  But, you know, like, you got to worry about a girl that answers the phone with a different  name each time.  Like, oh, yeah, this is so-and-so.  And then the next time she answers the phone, she's like, she's a different person.  Like, that's got bad news written all over it.  That shit's crazy.  That's great.  All right, Steve-O, get out of here.  Thank you guys so much.  They need your bed out there.  Steve-O, fucking jackass 3D in theaters this Friday.  Hey, if you don't ask for a little bit.  Um, Kenny has the information.  Oh, Kenny has the information.  Yeah, right outside the door.  Yeah, they're working out the, uh, details.  I'll talk to you soon, bro.  Steve, thanks, man.  Hey, for sure, man.  Thank you. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  Hey, thanks so much.  That's great.  Fucking Steve-O.  He looks good, right?  He looks really good.  He looks good.  He looks healthy as shit, man.  Unbelievable.  You know you're in the culture when, like, my friend's kids do little stunts and they  name them.  Oh, shit.  You know, you're over at my buddy's house and there's a nine-year-old and a seven-year-old.  This is called Pumpkin in the Head.  And then they do their own little mini kid versions that always just ends up with one  of them punching the other one in the balls or farting on his head or something.  But when he was talking about getting ingrained, I'm like, you know you're ingrained when you  got suburban kids recreating their own thing out there.  Yeah, if you've never seen Demise and Rise of Steve-O, holy shit. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah, check that out because it's fucked up, man.  I mean, you are watching somebody.  I want to ask him about him fighting with his neighbor.  That shit was amazing where he's punching holes in his own wall to get to the neighbor's  fucking apartment.  Yeah, he was just, he was beyond out of control.  Beyond out of control.  Just destroying his apartment.  He would have died sooner or later.  Like, uneventful death.  It's better.  He's so much better off now, man.  It's great to see.  You know what it is, though?  It's scary when you hear him say, like, you know, you can't guarantee you're going to  be sober.  And he knows that if he goes back, he's fucking dead.  He knows it. 
[03:14:00]  Anybody that thinks being sober, like, you know, oh, I know someone, I'm too fucked  up to get sober.  If fucking Steve-O can get sober for 31 months and be really a sober guy, he's not just not  drinking.  He's a sober dude.  He's taking it very seriously, too.  Anybody can fucking get sober.  That's an example.  If you want to get sober, you can.  All right, but the whole vegan thing, I mean, just knock that shit off.  It's impossible to go to dinner with you fucking people.  Oh, where do you want to go?  Oh, let's go to the tofu house.  The man ate light bulbs.  Let him make a healthy dietary choice. 
[03:14:30]  Do you understand all those years?  Fucking ate cannonballs.  Let him take care of himself.  Jimmy makes a valid answer.  That's true.  I love how Jimmy's talking about sobriety and he's looking just at Anthony, by the way.  I know.  Laser beams.  I'm much like, hey, Steve-O did it, asshole.  Wake up, stupid.  Believe me, I'm looking at Anthony and my thumb is pointed at Vic.  You got both of them covered.  Oh, my God.  What do you think, Dr. Steve? 
[03:15:00]  Dr. Steve.  Steve-O being inspirational.  I mean, who would have thought?  Who would have thought of that?  Was actually, in all seriousness, very inspirational.  It was cool to see because last time we saw him, he was fucked up.  And I don't want to give names, but we've had people come in here telling us they're sober  and you can see right through them.  That guy is fucking sober, man.  Toned and fit.  He looks in shape.  He looks like he's healthy and shit.  Way better than the last time we saw him. 
[03:15:30]  Hold on.  Kenny's not out there to give the information to Steve-O's people, so I'm going to give it  to you real quick, Sam.  Maybe you can run it out and give it to him and his publicist.  Also, don't forget, Jimmy Norton's going to be at Foxwood.  Yes.  Foxwood's Casino.  And that's tonight, I take it?  Tonight and tomorrow.  Tomorrow and Saturday.  He'll be drawing my Connecticut crowd away from me over there.  I'm outside of Hartford.  I'm at Bridge Street Live.  No, I'm at Bridge Street Live.  It's a music place.  It's having comedy now. 
[03:16:00]  Collinsville, Connecticut from McKinley.  Yes.  I'm going to be joining Jimmy Norton at Foxwood's, too.  So it's just a white trash festival in Connecticut this week.  It's going to be just watching me yelling at blackjack dealers, yelling at them.  What do you think someone like Steve-O does instead of drink now to keep the itch away?  That's the number.  Yeah, yeah.  Totally.  Right there.  Exercise.  I wish we were able to ask him that.  What do you think, Jimmy?  He's got to have the itch, so how is he getting rid of that?  You have to think it through. 
[03:16:30]  You don't really want to replace it with anything.  Sometimes sweets help or, you know, a soda.  Trannies.  He said masturbating internet porn.  Yeah, yeah.  He totally did.  You replace a little bit, but a lot of times just thinking it through, like where is this  going to take me, replaces what, you don't need to replace it necessarily when you think,  oh yeah, the last time I did this, I almost died.  So sometimes thinking it through really helps, and you don't need to replace it.  If you just replace it with some other unhealthy thing, usually you're going to go back to it.  Like, a lot of people quit smoking, and I don't think you could ask them what did you 
[03:17:00]  replace it with, except for stupid Voss with his gum.  Or you spit the gum out already.  Or you eat compulsively.  People that oral fixation has to maybe put weight on.  Because they stop smoking.  Yeah.  I mean, so there's always, there's something sometimes.  Outside of every A-meeting, there's a thousand coffee drinkers and smokers.  Coffee and cigarettes.  Coffee and smoking sitting there, you know, absolutely.  That seems to be the thing you've got to hook onto after you stop.  I don't know, though.  Boy, God, I would, that'd be a rough one for me.  No, you'd be fine.  Coffee and weed is the poor man's speedball. 
[03:17:30]  No, I mean, it would just be really rough to stop.  I enjoy drinking beer.  Well, that's what everyone says.  It's just right.  Of course.  I did, too.  I love to drink beer.  What happens was...  Yeah, I don't call the FBI with knives, though.  You don't need to.  You have guns.  Suddenly, I don't want to go up to the house.  All right, I'll give you a few.  Just don't go around shooting.  It's great.  You'll stick it back in Arkansas.  Alabama, Alabama.  It's all the same us up here.  You never called the FBI?  I never did 150 in a red car backwards down the highway. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, wow.  Really?  All right.  Well, you know.  He does make a point.  Nothing's happening.  It's a Saturday afternoon.  Nothing to do.  Hey, Dr. Steve, you want to go to 11 for us today?  To 11?  What?  You want to do some weird medicine shit?  11.  You're going to make them work?  Yeah.  You're actually going to stay past 10?  No.  We actually did.  We're in overtime right now.  We're going to do weird medicine Saturday.  Yeah, he doesn't want to blow his load.  All right.  What the fuck is that about?  Sure he does.  You take a couple calls.  Every time he talks sickness, he blows his load.  He loves it.  I found a boil. 
[03:18:30]  Oh.  You think he gets hard?  It's the late.  There's a lump under my arm.  Oh, God.  Tell me more.  Let me wipe this off.  That's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Let me get my nose in there.  The fury lights.  So tomorrow night, what time is the show, Steve?  It's Saturday.  I'm sorry, Saturday.  Saturday, 7 to 9 Eastern.  But Dr. Steve's going to be here tomorrow for what the hell is that?  Oh, right.  We got Steve.  Okay.  And Vic Henley, if you're around, come back because you didn't get a lot of time today 
[03:19:00]  because we had to squeeze Steve-O in there.  Tomorrow?  Sure.  I can do that.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  I've lost it.  Just come back sometime.  You're saying come back sometime.  I didn't know if you were extending today's.  I was just being nice.  You're supposed to pick up on that and just go, yeah, I'll see what it is.  I'm trying to sell tickets, buddy.  No, of course.  Come back tomorrow.  Yeah, boss will be here, too, right?  Come back tomorrow.  I don't know if you need me in, bro.  Yeah, it's fine.  Does Keith have his wife unloading fucking two, three cords of wood in my yard?  Atta boy.  Or is...  What is it?  Keith. 
[03:19:30]  And that wood better be out of my driveway.  Jesus.  I always look at my cameras.  I'm a security freak.  And you're someone who's delivering some firewood to the palatial estate?  Yeah, apparently I've got some firewood being delivered right now, and it's in my parking  space.  I can't park that and drive the Shelby at the same time, so please remove the wood.
