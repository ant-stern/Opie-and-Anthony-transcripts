<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter and discussing a supposedly broken story about James Lipton's alleged past as a pimp in Paris, lamenting the lack of promotion from SiriusXM and their PR department, citing low viewership for videos featuring guests like Anthony Bourdain and Ricky Gervais.  The scheduled appearance of Dan Marino was cancelled due to his unresponsive publicist, leading to speculation and a comparison of Marino's height to that of a short female guest, Mesh Nicole.  The hosts continued to complain about the lack of promotion for the Lipton story and the missing video clip on the SiriusXM website.  A significant portion focused on the excessive parking tickets given to delivery drivers in New York City, featuring a caller, Kenny (a UPS driver), detailing his daily struggles.  This transitioned into discussions about a deadly virus in the Middle East and a crude segment, "America's Got Genitals," featuring listener-submitted penis critiques. The segment ended with commentary on Maria Menounos' laugh and a swimsuit malfunction photo.

The show then moved to a discussion on the invention of the bra and a critical review of Prince's "Batdance" music video.  A call with Mike Francesa broke the news of John Tortorella's firing as New York Rangers coach, leading to a humorous anecdote from Opie about his nighttime activities involving Joe Benigno's radio show and prostitutes.  The hosts discussed Francesa's need to “scoop” other reporters and transitioned into a discussion of Jacqueline Onassis and her relationships, followed by a clip of Elisa Bridges' "I Want Some Action," with Opie expressing his dislike for the word "action."  A lengthy, beloved audio clip of Bruce Kelly emotionally recounting seeing The Who at Live Aid was played, with humorous commentary from the hosts, George Taylor Morris, and an unnamed redhead.  The absence of Dan Marino was discussed again, along with various celebrity endorsements, including Joe Theismann and Jimmy Johnson.  A listener letter about healthcare disparities for children was mentioned, and the hosts planned to play a montage of past show highlights ("nuggets").

The show then anticipated the arrival of Courtney Love, discussing strategies for a potentially confrontational interview, referencing past conflicts.  Jim Florentine, a frequent guest, was in the studio and promoted his upcoming appearances. Further discussion on Courtney Love's appearance, Florentine's projects, and confusion about SiriusXM’s radio packages ensued.

The Courtney Love interview began with a discussion of Jim Brewer's departure from a radio show, speculated to be due to budget cuts. Love described filming *Californication*, comparing the working styles of Harvey Keitel and Richard Pryor.  She shared an SNL-related story about Jim Brewer and addressed rumors and misconceptions about herself, notably a tampon-throwing incident at an L7 concert in England. She contrasted her past wild behavior with her current lifestyle, revealing she was working on a judging role on a new television show (hinting at American Idol).  She discussed her opinions on reality TV, auto-tune, lip-syncing, and a legal battle over Kurt Cobain's possessions involving Paul Allen and the Experience Music Project. The conversation included her relationship with Frances Bean Cobain and the recovery of Kurt's belongings, ending with discussion of her tour dates.

Following the interview, the show mocked Jim Florentine's fantasy football show.  An audiobook excerpt from *Fifty Shades of Gay* was played, followed by sexually explicit comments about Courtney Love's attractiveness.  More sexually charged jokes and anecdotes about the hosts' experiences with women on the road continued, with a brief return to the topic of Courtney Love and a snippet of a Betty Blowtorch song before the segment concluded.

The next segment revolved around raunchy anecdotes and boasts about the hosts' and Bob Levy's sexual exploits on the road, featuring explicit descriptions of casual sex encounters, including “pulling trains.” Levy recounted stories of hookers, strippers, and encounters in blizzards, along with deception used to pick up women and a bizarre hotel incident involving masturbation on a television. The hosts called themselves "The Load Warriors," discussing Levy's marriages and need for caregiving. A video of a man's hidden shower designed to soak people urinating outside his window was shown.  The show included a discussion of Candy Crush and concluded with a brief discussion of wrestling and potential "Load Warriors" merchandise. Jim Florentine was a guest.

The final segment heavily featured Troy’s experience with a suspected parasite, his decision to "ride the snake," and discussion of the unpleasantness and health risks.  The conversation shifted to predicting the "song of the summer," debating Emblem Three's "Chloe," Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines," Daft Punk's "Get Lucky," and Icona Pop's "I Love It," ultimately settling on Icona Pop's "I Love It," though with some disagreement.  Rob Cross (remotely) and caller Vinny contributed to the discussion, and the segment concluded with a promise to play Icona Pop on a future show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten egg from Sue.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony.  The Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Tie these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton. 
[00:01:30]  Lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, hearty horns should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everyone.  Hola. 
[00:02:00]  Hola.  How does that story seem like it's, the James Lipton story, how does that seem like it's  just breaking it out?  Yeah, I appreciate everyone on Twitter, but we got spanked on that one.  James Lipton came in here.  A month ago.  At least a month ago.  Might be two months by now.  Basically said he was a pimp in Paris.  We went, holy shit, this is big news.  No.  Gave it to the people around here and I don't know.  I don't know what they did with it.  Nothing.  They obviously didn't do much with it. 
[00:02:30]  And yesterday, it hits the...  Huffington Post?  Was it Huffington Post?  I was looking.  It was a hit Huffington Post that James Lipton was a pimp in Paris and everyone's talking  about it today.  And we have video of him talking about it.  Yes, we did.  We have video of him talking about it.  Yes, we do.  I mean, yes.  And nothing was done.  And then they wonder why we bitch.  Like, it's a huge headline today in that world. 
[00:03:00]  We had it a month to two months ago.  March 18th was when he was on.  So, two months ago.  So, something we broke two months ago is now on the Huffington Post as their little scoop.  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  Nothing.  Nothing.  What are you going to do?  Just sit here.  Big shit on.  No.  Things are alright.  Right?  Of course.  We don't have to see anyone. 
[00:03:30]  We don't have to answer to anyone.  It's great.  Doesn't mean it moves your career forward, but it's a nice comfy fucking seat.  But is there a better example of sludge than that?  Like, I don't know whose thing it is, but we had that video of that from two months ago.  We film all the celebrity interviews.  And most of them, you're like, eh, put it in the vault, whatever.  But every once in a while, you get a little nugget.  A little nugget of information.  That word.  That's why I'm using it. 
[00:04:00]  I know.  It's a little nugget.  And every once in a while, we say, oh my God, we got a nugget.  And then we try to push it out.  Push out that nugget.  And I remember that day, we all were trying to push out that nugget.  We said, we got something here.  What are we going to do about it, people?  Yeah.  But I don't even know if SiriusXM has a PR department.  I really don't know.  Because I've never really met any of those people.  It's on the couch.  PR!  Yo!  Kid!  Oh, see.  It was...  Stealing up, kids! 
[00:04:30]  Mars.  I don't know.  I think I met a guy a long time ago that might have been in PR, but I'm not sure.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And, you know, I guess we're a high-profile show here.  You would think we'd be buddy-buddy with the PR people.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Got a few things going on.  We'd like to get out there.  Everyone just kind of hides all day long in hopes they don't get fired.  I think that's what happens around here. 
[00:05:00]  I think that's common at work, though.  Yeah, yeah.  We'd like to scurry around, try to look like a busy little ant.  True dat.  And, uh...  Yeah.  We could do a little more housekeeping.  Oh.  I guess Dan Marino is not coming today.  Supposedly he was booked.  It's very sketchy.  That was clusterfuckish right from the get-go.  I got so much shit to be signed from people in Philly. 
[00:05:30]  That ain't gonna happen.  I'm carrying in all sorts of boxes today, knowing that Dan Marino's not showing up.  I had to tell those guys that Dan Marino's not showing up last night, and they're really  bummed.  And then I wrote, oh, I'll get him to sign these things.  Oh, yeah, I will.  Oh, really?  Somehow, someway, I gotta.  They spent a lot of money.  Oh, man.  On Dolphins' fucking football helmets and footballs and all sorts of shit.  He was booked for, what, Tuesday?  Monday? 
[00:06:00]  Tuesday?  And then, right when I heard...  But then he was here Tuesday, but he didn't do our show, but then he was gonna be in New  York, and he was gonna go fucking sightsee, I think, and then he was gonna come back to  do our show.  And then, according to Roland, and I can't wait to get Roland on the air, his publicist  went, MIA, and is not returning Roland's phone calls anymore.  What happened?  A publicist for Dan Marino not returning phone calls.  That seems very, very strange or sketchy to me. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I would just like to know why in the end.  Wow, there's a picture with Mesh and Nicole.  When did that happen?  Tuesday.  What do you mean Tuesday?  We were here Tuesday.  Not at this time.  What time was your Tuesday afternoon?  Yeah, I think it was like 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock.  Oh, my God, 1 o'clock.  That's like another day to us.  Yeah.  We were out of here by 10.  So, if we hung out until 1, we would have met him?  Yeah.  Oh, that ain't happening.  That was the moment, though.  When he was here on Tuesday afternoon, he's not coming back in this building.  He's not, right? 
[00:07:00]  No way.  No way.  No fucking way.  So, why don't they tell us the truth?  That's all.  That's all we ask in the end.  Yeah, I have to.  The publicist should get on the phone and roll in and basically say, look, we got, I don't  know what it is, you know, he found out about your show and he's not into doing it or whatever  the reason would be.  Give us something.  But that reason would be stupid at this point because we've had enough A-listers coming through  that we've treated very, very well.  We could use a little nugget of information. 
[00:07:30]  As much as you hate the nugget, you're going to be using it.  You're going to be using it.  Good geek.  The Opie and Anthony nugget.  Probably has most to do with just, no, I already did Sirius, I don't need to come  back.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Well, there's the Opie and Anthony show.  Who cares?  I did Sirius, right?  I did Sirius.  Oh, yeah, sure.  We did it.  Let him get a tape of one of my other interviews.  Let's not forget Dan Marino, Jim Kelly owned you.  Oh, shit.  He owned you.  Here comes the bashing. 
[00:08:00]  He owned you.  Even though Jim Kelly never got that Super Bowl ring, he certainly fucking owned Dan Marino.  How tall a gentleman is Dan Marino?  No, I think he's like 5'7".  He's next to Mashup Nicole there, and he's like towering over her.  Yeah, well, she's like 5'1".  Is she a midget?  Yeah, Mashup Nicole's 5'1".  Dan Marino's about 5'7", I believe.  What?  I think your numbers might be off.  Yeah, look, there's about a six-inch difference there. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I just think the starting point might be the same.  I don't know if Nicole...  It's like a foot difference.  Nicole's...  I think she might be slightly taller than 5'1".  Oh, Nicole probably wasn't wearing her high heels that day.  So she's probably about 4'10 in that picture.  4'10".  So Mashup Nicole's 4'10 without her shoes on.  Like Snooki.  Yeah, they're about the same height.  So Marino's about 5'.  I'll give him about 5'6 and a half for Dan Marino.  Tops.  Bumps it up to 5'7 for media. 
[00:09:00]  I'll just say he looks like a tall gentleman.  Well, but it's deceiving because, like we just went over, Nicole's very, very short.  He's got a big head.  Yes.  He does have a big fucking head.  So no Dan Marino and no James Lipton scoop.  No.  There's your housekeeping for today.  That James Lipton thing, it makes me physically ill.  Because we knew.  We said, this is big.  This is big news.  No, this is important.  This stuff's important. 
[00:09:30]  Did they at least put the James Lipton pimp clip on SiriusXM's website?  Like we told them to do?  Check out a look.  Go on SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Can they go there for the podcast too?  Yeah.  First thing you see is Opie and Anthony podcast.  Subscribe to the Opie and Anthony podcast.  Because a lot of people that don't have their, you know, don't have iPhones are trying to  figure out how to get the podcast.  It's so easy.  If they go there, they can do it?  Yeah.  All right.  That one's a pretty easy one to figure out. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see if we got the James Lipton clip on the Opie and Anthony site like we asked.  Anthony Bourdain.  Nice.  Ricky Gervais.  Nice.  Ricky Gervais.  Paul Anka.  Nice.  Chris Hardwick.  Nice-ish.  Chris Hardwick.  Nice-ish.  Nice.  Fandango.  Nice.  David Lee Roth.  Uh-oh.  Nice.  Daryl Hammond.  Nice.  No, it's not there.  Jimmy, don't pay attention because you're going to get really mad. 
[00:10:30]  I don't even think it's up there.  It's not there.  Scientology?  Girl?  No, we're going way back now.  Chris Kyle?  Chris Kyle.  Jesus.  He's no longer with us.  Vanilla Ice.  Chris Kyle?  Yeah.  Let me check.  All right.  This whole deal.  That ain't a deal.  Oh, $1,400.  Almost $1,500.  $1,500.  $1,500.  Did we give them the James Lipton clip?  Of course we did.  We gave them all the video that they asked for.  Of course we did. 
[00:11:00]  Well, they asked for it, but did we give it to them?  If they don't have it, they can't put it up.  This can't be real radio, right?  I think I'm back in college radio.  No, it's satellite.  I think I went backwards.  I went backwards in my career.  Backwards.  How is that clip not up there?  I don't know.  It should have been.  James Lipton, on our show, says he used to be a pimp in Paris.  Yeah.  We have video of it, and it didn't even make the fucking website.  I know we told him to put that up there.  I don't see it. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, boy.  Who do we blame?  At this point, I don't even know.  Whoever you want, there's so many people you could.  But it doesn't even matter, because when we put a video clip up there,  it doesn't even get any views.  No, no.  They really don't know how to push their videos.  No.  Which amazes me, because they have a whole platform to push people to these videos.  I mean, you have Anthony Bourdain, right on the eve of his new show on CNN, 
[00:12:00]  starting, talking about UFC 159 right after it happened.  Right.  A double topical thing.  Right.  He's got a very hot show on CNN.  And it's on this show.  I am a fan of that show.  That's an instant boost.  Right.  That's got 1,100 views.  1,100?  1,100.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah, those things.  They're just sitting there.  It's like a personal fucking family photo album.  It's just no one's looking.  When was he in? 
[00:12:30]  Can we ask when he was in?  I already said.  I'm sorry, when?  March 18th.  Okay.  Two months ago.  Well, you have to say about two and a half months ago at this point, right?  Right.  Who are you writing?  Scott.  Scott Greenstein.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Stirring the old pot.  What's wrong with that?  Getting a little action.  I think Baldy just lost his last strand of hair. 
[00:13:00]  It's going to make some people unhappy.  Who?  Who's going to be unhappy?  We're unhappy.  The gym's interviewing.  The gym's emailing Scott.  Yeah.  Probably everybody under Scott.  Oh, really?  Everyone's head.  Yeah, but we go right to the guy now, because obviously the guys below him are doing nothing  of significance.  Oh, itching that back.  I guess I got like...  Dry skin.  I got sunburned the other day.  Yeah.  A little bit.  And Jake Lipton said when we asked him, that's the first time anybody's ever asked me about 
[00:13:30]  that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We have that.  We have that record as well.  Yes, we do.  Yes, we do.  In the mud.  We're in the mud.  Yes, we do.  Jimmy, make sure you're right.  You know, the video never even made it to the company's website.  But they weren't giving the video.  They have it.  They have to.  As far as I know.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't...  Oh, boy. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, look.  After the end of World War II, if I had a nickel for every cameraman on Morning Joe that could  tell that same story, Mika...  Oh, my gosh.  Willie and I would be at the dog track right now.  Lipton explained that when he ran out of money, a prostitute he befriended told him he would 
[00:14:30]  be able to stay...  Why does this story keep going on and on and on?  If he became her pimp.  Oh, my God.  Which he did for an entire year.  Lipton, however, does not condone prostitution, kids.  If you're watching, I'm saying, quote, if you can't earn it on your own, then you don't  deserve it, and my God, Willie, is that not...  In fact, you've got that actually plaque up right outside your office.  For coincidence, we were just talking about that.  On your own. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  Fucking embarrassing.  Can you imagine Lipton?  It's an elegant man.  He's an elegant man.  Running around with...  I wonder if guys would come to him and have, like, a stack of cards.  Would you like...  The blue cards.  Veronica, our Mercedes.  They didn't have the Mercedes back then.  That's more modern strip joints, just for your...  Okay.  The Edsel?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Edsel?  Would you like Edsel?  All right.  All right.  Let's take a look at Playbook, because...  Right.  So, that's MSNBC, May 30th, 2013, talking about the James Lipton pimp thing that we had 
[00:15:30]  March 18th.  With video.  With video of the guy saying it.  With video.  And explaining exactly what he was doing back then.  All we know for sure is that the audio of the interview...  By the way, I mean, this is a print interview that they're getting the quote from.  Right.  So, even having audio.  But the audio went out March 18th, 2013, 1032 AM.  What do you mean it went out? 
[00:16:00]  Like, Travis uploaded the audio and then sent it to our PR department.  So, what do they do with the audio?  It's still in their folder.  Why are we getting video, too, though?  I mean, the audio is nice, but the video is, like, what people would post.  I'm sure at some point video was given, or if it was asked...  I mean, whatever.  We had video of everything.  No video had been sent.  So, there you go.  It's a big story.  Yesterday and today.  Nice.  Something we had...  There's got to be a publicist dedicated to the show. 
[00:16:30]  That's the problem.  The publicist for this company will never do anything for the show.  That's how Howard gets himself mentioned in all these stories.  It's his publicist, not him.  He's not calling people.  Publicist does.  Behind the scenes people.  There's no publicist dedicated to this show.  No one.  The Washington Post is crediting Parade Magazine with the James Lipton pimp story today.  Parade Magazine is a good publicist.  There you go.  The Washington Post crediting Parade Magazine for something we had almost two and a half months ago.  Oh, boy. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  Maybe we'll get something from Dan Marino today.  Oh, he's not coming in.  What?  I just want to know why he's not coming in.  Period.  Why isn't he coming in?  He's got his period?  Yeah, he probably has his period.  Oh.  What's if I heard from Opie?  Jimmy, you might have broke your headphones.  Oh, shit.  You are broken.  Yeah.  Try me for him.  I'll pay for him.  Here's. 
[00:17:30]  No, they're fine.  You just got to snap them back together.  The earpiece just came off when they hit the wall at great velocity.  Well, you know, it's like, there's going to be times where, like with the Bill O'Reilly  thing with the Chris Kyle, Jesse Ventura story.  Right.  People aren't going to credit you.  We got a lot of credit for that.  Back when that happened, then Bill O'Reilly decided to be a scumbag about it, to be honest  with you.  Yeah, he's a douche.  You know, there'll always be scumbags that will, you know, take your shit and then make 
[00:18:00]  believe they came up with it.  Yeah.  But this one, we had a two and a half month lead on.  Two and a half months.  And just like everything else, it gets dropped and forgotten and mishandled.  And I don't even know who it was anymore.  And it's frustrating.  It doesn't even matter.  We're just talking in a vacuum here.  We're talking in a fucking vacuum.  Yeah, that's why you just got to laugh at this point.  We know we have extremely incompetent people that are, you know, babysitting the channel.  We all know that. 
[00:18:30]  Everyone knows that.  They should be on top of this shit every fucking day.  Every day.  Enough with the fucking wiener jokes, please.  Huh?  Fucking wiener running for mayor.  It's like the puns just are ridiculous that they're still even doing them.  Right.  Like, can we just move on now?  Just go with this fucking...  All right, he wants to run for mayor. 
[00:19:00]  But it's always, you know, oh, look at...  He's moving up in the polls, too, man.  Up, ooh.  Yeah, wiener's up.  That's what they'll do.  He's ticking upwards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wiener's pickle.  Wiener exposed.  Obama beats wiener.  Wiener's second coming.  Hide the wiener.  Where's wiener?  Wiener's rise and fall.  Wiener pulls out.  Wiener pops again. 
[00:19:30]  These are very clever headlines.  These are extremely clever.  Wiener's long, hard road back.  Really?  Naked truth.  You're not making these up?  No.  These are all ones that have been used.  It's like...  I'm tired of it.  It's ridiculous.  Our own mayor.  Mayor Bloomberg got some of that rice.  Van Mound from some flounder?  Got some of that ricin in the mail. 
[00:20:00]  Ricin.  Some of that poison.  Yeah, apparently attached to a letter from somebody very angry about his gun control stance.  Yikes.  Yeah.  That doesn't help the cause very much.  Not good, right?  No.  That's just going to piss them off.  Yeah, that.  And they can all turn around and be like, see?  The gun people are crazy.  It's like, well, anyone's crazy if you piss them off that much.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  No matter what you do. 
[00:20:30]  Where are we at with that?  That story kind of just faded away yesterday.  They're investigating.  Seems like a big story.  Yeah.  I guess there's nothing else to report right now.  Nah, they're looking into it, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  They're usually pretty good with finding out that shit, though.  Yeah.  Using the letter and where it came from.  Handwriting.  Right.  Meh.  But you see those...  You've been seeing the bikes around?  Yeah, I've seen the bikes. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  I know a lot of you guys hate them, but I saw how they worked in Boston.  I kind of liked them, to be honest with you.  Yeah, I went up to Boston last year for my birthday, and for tourists, they're great.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden, you've got a whole bunch of little things you want to see, and  cabs could get expensive for most people, obviously, and you can't walk to all these  places.  So all you do is you put your credit card in, you grab a bike, and then you ride around,  and then most of the places you want to see, you could drop the bike off there. 
[00:21:30]  And then you could get another bike, I guess, if you want, to get back to your destination,  I guess.  Your final destination, I should say.  What if one place is a lot more popular?  I don't know.  Dropping a bike off, and then another place has no more bikes left.  Yeah, you've got to find a spot.  That is the problem.  And if you don't find a spot, because you've got to lock that shit back up, because they've  got your credit card info.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I guess you've got to go to another one.  What a pain in the ass.  I guess.  Maybe they have a few extra, like, whatever they're calling them, like those bike rack 
[00:22:00]  things, just in case that happens.  I don't know.  You hate them, right?  No, I haven't even seen any around.  Oh, they're all over Central Park.  They haven't bothered me.  Or on the outskirts of Central Park, there's a whole row of them.  Yeah, they haven't bothered me or anything, so.  I liked it.  Until that happens, I give a shit.  I kind of liked it when I went to Boston.  It was like, oh, I'm going to go over here now.  And I just jumped on one of those dumb things.  Yeah.  Eh.  It was convenient.  They look a little silly.  Yeah, they're not.  They're a silly look.  I guess they don't want them to look too good, because then people would steal them. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, but if someone steals them, they got your credit card info.  They don't give a fuck.  They'll just charge your credit card in the end, and they'll just get a new bike in its  place.  Yeah, but then.  It's your responsibility as soon as you put that credit card in, just like if it was  your bike that you owned.  If somebody just steals it, though.  Then you're fucked.  Yeah.  You're the one fucked, just like you would be if your regular bike got stolen.  You basically own that bike for the, what, they only give you 45 minutes, though, which  is stupid. 
[00:23:00]  Really?  45 minutes goes by like that.  And then what happens if you're not fucking locking it in somewhere else in 45 minutes?  I guess they're, I don't know exactly how their program works, but I would assume there's  late charges.  A little late fee.  Yeah.  And then what happens, because I know it's the law, you gotta wear a helmet.  What, you gotta carry around a fucking helmet?  There's no law, there's no bike, uh.  There's no helmet law for bikes?  No, no, no, I refuse to wear one.  Whoa.  That's my little stance.  Is that your little fucking rebel attitude right there?  Because we grew up without bike helmets. 
[00:23:30]  I think it's ridiculous.  I swear I thought it was a law.  And I fly over my handlebars at least once a summer.  Head injuries.  Because of stupid cab doors.  No, we invented head injuries for bicyclists.  You would think Bloomberg would be all over fucking a helmet law for bicycles.  I'm sure we're heading that way.  And obviously I was joking about inventing head injuries.  But my point is, we all grew up without helmets, riding bikes.  How many guys do you know that something fucked up happened to?  Eh, not that many. 
[00:24:00]  But with that said, I'll throw a helmet on my own kids.  Well, you gotta do that.  Right.  A little noggin.  Yeah, I just hate the bike helmet.  It's ridiculous.  They do look a little foolish.  Ah, they're uncomfortable.  Sit way high up on the head.  Yeah, they're just, I don't like it.  Hmm.  So.  I, uh, wow.  I wonder why Bloomy hasn't fucking done that, though.  Hear that?  That's got him written all over it.  Yeah.  Bike helmets.  Yeah.  Helmets in his mouth.  Ah.  You know. 
[00:24:30]  Because, you know, I think he's a big queen.  I don't know.  I think the bike program's pretty cool.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You giving the mayor kudos on this one?  Kudos?  Well, you can't hate him for every single thing.  That's true.  You could try.  I mean, then you just kind of start looking like a dick.  Fuck him.  Right.  There are times I guess he's doing good shit.  I don't know.  Yeah.  In general, I don't like the guy.  Of course not.  Yeah, he's a little out of touch. 
[00:25:00]  Out of touch.  Of course not.  I think the parking fucking shit, the parking scam this city has going on and most cities  have going on is ridiculous.  Although, when I was in Rochester, I knew I could park and do some shit knowing there  wasn't one of those fucking meter maids, you know, 10 feet away waiting for me to  do something illegal to give me a ticket.  In other cities, they're way more lax.  And they're not around.  They don't have a lot of guys around.  But in New York, there is a meter maid, and they're still called meter maids for most 
[00:25:30]  of us New Yorkers.  Like, within a block of your car at all times, they're just marching around doing circles  all day long, just fucking giving out tickets.  We want to be called traffic enforcement officers.  Yeah, do you?  Go fuck yourself.  You're a meter maid.  Did you read the figure that they have, I think, six...  How much is it?  For UPS?  How many millions of dollars in tickets already for the first third of the year?  And it was for UPS?  And FedEx, yeah.  And FedEx.  Could you find that?  It is.  That was when we were off.  A fuckload of money.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  And, you know, and no one wants to acknowledge that it would be impossible for these companies  to do their jobs unless they parked illegally.  Impossible.  Illegally.  It would be impossible.  When you have just a stupid, shitty car that you've got to park once a day after work,  it could take you a half hour to park illegally.  Illegally, excuse me.  Because I lived in one of those brownstones for a while with a car, and some days you're  in your car for a half hour to 45 minutes waiting for a spot to open up.  So, of course, these companies couldn't do their jobs unless they parked illegally. 
[00:26:30]  Of course.  And everyone knows it.  And the companies can't do this.  But what would happen if FedEx and UPS simply refused to deliver to New York City?  They would lose way too much money.  They would probably lose too much, but would eventually New York City buckle?  Or do they make so much more that it's just not worth it?  Your scenario would never happen just because FedEx and UPS needs to fucking deliver to  Manhattan for their own livelihood.  It's a little game everyone's playing and makes believe isn't happening out there.  FedEx and UPS owe $2.8 million in parking tickets to the city in the first three months 
[00:27:00]  of 2013.  $2.8 million.  That's a lot of money.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  So, what would the city tell UPS and FedEx?  That you've got to find legal parking?  They know that's impossible.  It's literally impossible.  They know that's impossible.  They can't do that.  And you know when you should be giving a delivery truck a ticket or not.  There are times it's so obvious that the illegal parking spot they choose is really a nuisance 
[00:27:30]  for a lot of people.  But in most cases, it really isn't.  They're just kind of off to the side of the road and traffic is still moving fine.  They're delivering their goods and there's that meter maid just riding at that ticket  and multiple tickets per truck every fucking day.  And we all just accept it.  Yeah, you've got to put it in perspective, look at it.  Is it fucking up the flow of traffic?  Is it a safety problem?  Then you make a judgment call. 
[00:28:00]  Aside from that, you're just doing it to make money.  It's not a safety issue anymore.  Of course not.  It's not a convenience issue.  It's a revenue issue.  They expect that money.  It's already in the budget.  Right, because they're shitty at doing their job, so they've got to find other ways to  make money.  Yeah.  And this is one way they figured out how to make money is by fucking the delivery trucks.  Yep.  Wow.  Talk to these guys.  They get about 10 to 12 tickets a day, each truck.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Each truck.  And they don't even flinch anymore. 
[00:28:30]  They just collect the fucking tickets, put it on their dashboard, hand it in to their  boss, and then these guys go down to the courts and they make some kind of deal with  the city.  So they get a little off.  Yeah.  But they're still paying a shitload of money to the city.  Just millions of dollars.  Mm-hmm.  $2.8 million for FedEx and UPS alone.  You know, then you got all the beer trucks.  You got the Coca-Cola trucks.  You got the fish trucks.  You got the fucking beef trucks.  You got...  It just goes on and on. 
[00:29:00]  I can't imagine how much money they're making off this.  And you're right.  If they didn't deliver, if those two didn't deliver, another company would, or the post  office would.  And the city knows that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's probably why they gave them a little break in the end.  They got them by the purse strings.  Yeah.  The purse strings.  So...  Damn.  And then we got some weird virus that is killing people.  What?  CNN says it's a threat to the world. 
[00:29:30]  And then within two minutes, they were doing a Justin Bieber story.  So I'm thinking to myself, I guess it's not really a threat to the world if they're moving  on to Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  What's the virus?  It's some new fucking...  Unfunny comic.  I'm coming in here.  It's sort of a SARS-type virus.  It's in the Middle East.  But it's moved on to, I think, Germany, France, and where else do they say?  Close the borders.  And it's a threat to the world because they don't know where the virus lives.  And they don't know how the fuck people are getting this thing. 
[00:30:00]  So they're very scared.  And it's killed half the people so far.  27 people have died out of 49 that have got...  I have a 50% mortality.  Yes.  That's crazy.  That's movie shit.  Wow.  And I didn't have the audio on my TV.  I just saw a threat to the world.  So then I turned it on, got a little info.  The little info I just gave everybody.  And then they went on to Justin Bieber speeding around his neighborhood.  Did it start in the Chang-Twang province?  In the Chang-Twa? 
[00:30:30]  I don't think there's...  There's always some fucking shithole.  I don't know where it started.  Yeah.  Where's patient zero?  And whatever happened to all the other diseases that were threatening the world?  Bird flu?  Bird flu.  You got the swine flu.  You got the...  The SARS.  You got the Ebola.  You got the Legionnaires disease.  I don't remember that.  What?  I don't remember Legionnaires disease.  Yeah.  There it is.  New SARS-like virus is a threat to the entire world.  Right there.  Threat to entire world. 
[00:31:00]  Can you click play on this fucking thing?  Oh, man.  I'm going to feel like I have it.  I hate that.  Hossein Al-Sheikh says his father died after a chest infection that quickly worsened into kidney failure.  Oh, man.  Soon after, other family members fell ill, too.  Doctors now believe it was the new, deadly coronavirus.  Well, the first time...  I like corona.  A little limon top right here.  The first thing I thought about is,  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  Allah, what about.  Allah, what about. 
[00:31:30]  Allah, what about.  He's going to die.  The first time they told me I have corona,  the first thing I thought about is,  I'm going to die.  What, why is that?  Because I thought about my dad and I said,  it's going to be the same case and I'm going to lose my life.  This is NCOV and the World Health Organization is monitoring it closely,  especially now that human-to-human transmission has been verified between patients and from a patient to health care workers.  Oh, boy.  Doctors from the WHO are in Saudi Arabia to monitor the spread of the virus. 
[00:32:00]  Most concern, however, is the fact that the different clusters seen in multiple countries increasingly support the hypothesis  that when there is close contact, this novel coronavirus can transmit from person to person.  Now, according to the Centers for Disease Control, this is where the virus was first detected in 2012.  Saudi Arabia figures.  Saudi Arabia.  Then, it spread to other countries in the Middle East, including Qatar and Jordan.  Now, by February of this year, travelers to the Middle East had brought the virus to Europe. 
[00:32:30]  France, Germany, and the UK all reported mostly isolated cases.  Now, there have been at least 40 confirmed cases, and 20 of those patients have died.  The largest cluster is in Saudi Arabia.  Doctors say anyone with sustained daily close contact with an infected person is at risk of contracting the virus.  You think?  There is no evidence yet that it can be passed on through casual contact,  but health authorities are keeping a close watch for any indication that it could spread more quickly. 
[00:33:00]  Atika Schubert, CNN, London.  London.  There you go.  And then they went out to Justin Bieber, so.  Justin Bieber with a speeding car.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's a threat to the world, just one person at a time.  Yeah.  You got that right.  Justin Bieber.  We got a UPS truck driver.  Oh.  We're moving on from the threat to the world now, too, because we don't know anything else.  We don't know anything else. 
[00:33:30]  Kenny in Queens, what's up?  Hi.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Kenny.  Hey.  This is also what they do.  They, like, if you give, like, if you double park, right?  They don't give you double parking.  They write in the other.  They write, obstructing lane of traffic.  So you can't even, like, you can't even, like, you can't even, like, you can't even, like, when they go to fight the ticket, they can't, um, we pay, like, half the price on those tickets.  Like, double parking. 
[00:34:00]  But they don't, we pay full price for, like, bus stops and fire hydrants.  So they write in, obstructing lane of traffic so they can't get the half price on the tickets with double parking.  You're a little nervous, huh, Kenny?  Oh, man.  Look at you.  I'm listening to you.  You're freaking me out.  Holy shit.  I got anxiety, though.  Right?  Kenny.  And the double parking is not, like, a hydrant.  It's obstructing a lane. 
[00:34:30]  Why is it when I listen to other radio shows, they let these guys off the hook?  But we have to show the world that they're nervous.  Kenny.  It's all good, Kenny.  What I want to ask you is how many tickets you get a day?  Me?  I get one.  I get one a day.  Right?  My area is not too, uh, I get one a day, but a lot of other guys, they get, like, five, six, seven tickets a day, the second they move. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  They basically get a ticket at every stop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what they also did was they used to be able to park by a meter, right?  If you park by a meter, you wouldn't get a ticket, right?  And, but now that, when they moved, they took away the meters, and they put in the muni meters, that's not part of the deal they have.  So, UPS issued everyone credit cards to pay for the meters.  Because it's cheaper for them to pay for the meters than they do it now. 
[00:35:30]  Because it's not necessarily a parking meter anymore.  It's a muni meter.  Right.  So, you have to pay.  So, UPS issued everyone cards to pay for the meter.  Yeah.  All right.  Can you, whoever's pointing the gun at you, can you ask them to put it down while you're finished?  All right, Kenny.  So, Kenny, did that help the meter?  Did you guys pay the meter?  They don't ticket you, right?  No, but they're still illegally parked.  So, they're giving them tickets for other shit, right?  Um, they give us, they'll give us tickets for, um, for mostly, like, you know, double parking, or, like, parking by the hydrants. 
[00:36:00]  The cops are not that bad.  The cops that give out the tickets, they'll let you slide.  Yeah.  But it's the meter maze.  Yeah, they're fucking crazy.  They're fucking the worst.  Yeah.  The only thing they will not give me a ticket for is, like, the alternate side parking.  Like, I've never got a ticket for that.  So, if you're, yeah, you're parked over where they...  Yeah, they usually don't, because you're in and out, but anything else, they'll give tickets for. 
[00:36:30]  That was a fucking nightmare when I lived in Brooklyn.  That's what I'm saying.  Dude, that alternate side parking, running outside, changing the side of the street you parked on.  Oh, and there's never fucking parking.  And that's a scam, too, because they say, because they have to clean the streets every day.  First of all, you don't have to clean a city street every day.  That's ridiculous.  But basically, it is to catch you parking illegally again to make more money for the city.  Period.  That's all that is.  They don't need to clean the streets that much. 
[00:37:00]  That's it.  Once a month, maybe.  Silly.  In New Jersey, when I lived with Florentine...  Thanks, Kenny.  ...we had that place, and I remember coming home at night, and I would try to find street parking.  And I remember the rage...  Yes!  ...at certain cars that would park wrong every night.  Like, you know, when there's a space for two, and you'd see one fucking cunt hogging both spots,  because they don't care about it.  It really makes you want to...  It really...  This is why, again, I don't own a weapon, because it really makes you want to go door-to-door 
[00:37:30]  and just start fucking firing at people.  Because they're so self-centered.  Yes.  We all have to park here together.  I would always try to be courteous and pull up to the very end of the spot...  That's what you do.  ...leaving space behind me.  You pull up right to the end, and then everyone else falls into place behind the car that's  at the front of a parking zone.  But no, they'll just pull in and fucking stop.  Oh, Trav, do you deal with this shit?  Of course he does.  Look, you fucking rushed in.  It's even worse in my neighborhood, because in the summer, on the weekends, you can't park 
[00:38:00]  on 80% of the streets in Rockaway.  Oh, right.  Touristas are there.  Yeah, to kind of...  No, there's no parking at all to kind of, you know, make tourists not come.  Oh, I see.  So this guy, this asshole on my street, our alternate side parking is Friday.  So he comes out two hours early, sits in his car, and waits until alternate side street  cleaning is over, and then he parks in this one spot that is technically two spots. 
[00:38:30]  It's in between two driveways.  Uh-huh.  You know what I'm saying?  It will fit two cars, but a lot of people with an oversized car, it'll only fit one car.  He has a note on his windshield that says, I get up two hours early to save this spot  for my two cars.  I don't see anyone else doing this.  He's had that spot for three weeks now.  He doesn't move his car.  He moves it into the middle when he goes to work with his other car, and then when he 
[00:39:00]  brings his other car back...  He takes up both the spots.  Yeah.  He's a selfish fuck.  I hate him.  Somebody should break his windows.  I hope somebody breaks his fucking windows or slashes his tires.  I'll fuck him over somehow.  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to think of what to do.  Pull in.  Well, he doesn't give a shit.  I mean, he obviously doesn't give a shit about anybody, so what are you going to do?  Yell at him?  He doesn't fucking care.  No, no, no, but take his spots somehow.  You can't.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, he'll sit in the spot.  When the street cleaner comes down the street, he'll move his car. 
[00:39:30]  You know what you want to do?  When he fucking...  You want to be a jerk-off.  When he pulls the car up one day and gets out to get the other one, sneak in.  Exactly.  That's what I mean.  Find him.  Or wait while the street cleaner guy, the second the street cleaner guy passes by there,  you pull right in.  Pull right in.  I know I should, but like...  You got a hammer?  You got a nail?  I got a hammer, yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Take that nail to the wheel.  Spike strip.  But you take that nail back with you.  It's just the selfishness of some people, especially in a community like mine where parking 
[00:40:00]  is at such a premium in the summer, it's enraging.  What an ass head.  I'll bring a picture tomorrow of the note that he puts on his window.  It is fucking raging.  And the guy at the end of our block would do that, like right next door to me and Jim.  He would hog two spots.  The only...  It was the last spot on the block and they were an old couple.  So it was slightly more tolerable.  But I really did want to break his legs with a fucking giant stick.  And I hope he's dead.  I don't know what...  I hope he died somehow with his family watching. 
[00:40:30]  Jeez.  Yeah.  I hope it was Christmas morning.  They're all like, oh, pop!  And he fucking fell down the steps.  Cocksucker.  I hope he died while he was moving his car.  But people who deal with that know the rage you feel for such utter selfishness.  Like a guy...  Yeah.  80% of the time, he's hogging that spot with one car.  And then when him or his wife comes home, he moves his car up and the wife pulls it.  Someone is...  Oh, they do it together. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't even do it at the same time.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  Like, I think only one of them works.  And he works for the MTA, by the way, which just doesn't surprise anyone.  So, yeah, he's obviously a piece of shit.  You've got to smear, like, dog shit on his windshield.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You don't have it in you, do you?  It's not that I don't have it in me, but it's like, that's not going to accomplish anything.  I want to do something that accomplishes something.  Oh, it just makes you feel good inside.  Sometimes you've got to...  Are you kidding me?  Yes.  He'll continue to park there, but you'll feel so good.  He'll smile a little bit when you see that car parked like that.  Do you think other people hate him in the neighborhood? 
[00:41:30]  Everyone.  Everyone.  I know exactly who he is.  What's he look like?  So I'm surprised his car isn't fucked up.  He's like a middle-aged Hispanic guy.  Works for the MTA.  Probably doing a dead-end job.  And he hogged a fucking spot.  So what he is, like, he'll move up and his wife immediately pulls in behind him.  Yeah, like, what I'm assuming, because I've never seen them do this, but what I assume  is, okay, honey, I'm outside.  Okay, guy comes downstairs, or wife comes downstairs, moves the car up, and immediately puts the  other car behind him.  Oh, so he doesn't get out and then get back. 
[00:42:00]  No, no, no.  Somebody might have stolen the spot already if he did that.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Anyway.  He's pretty smart, though.  Yeah, I guess.  You've got to give it to him for being smart.  If you're him, it rules.  Yeah.  He's got a parking spot for the summer.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's too much pressure, though.  You've got to assume that the neighborhood hates you, and eventually they're going to  do something to your car.  You have to.  Like, I wouldn't be able to live with myself, like, knowing that, like, everybody hates  you.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, how do you come to work, then?  Wait, wait, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  We all fucking...  You just said that.  Yeah.  Fucking shit.  We'll get him next time.  Yeah.  We've got Jim Florentine coming in today.  Nice.  And possibly Courtney Love stopping by for the first time ever?  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  Florentine's a big football fan.  That'll be nice to see him interact with Dan Marino.  Well, he knows Dan.  I would love to ask Jim about that, because they're actually friends.  Oh, no, they're not.  They really are.  I think they are. 
[00:43:00]  Florentine's a big Dolphins fan, and I remember when he got the gig on HBO with Marino for Inside  HBO Sports, whatever it was, and Jim was doing sketches on that.  And I remember how happy I was with him, because he became friends with Dan, and he fucking...  He would always tell me how, like, even when he was in relationships, he would always  say, like, Marino's the one guy I would, like, bang my chick.  He would always say that he would like to pull a train with Marino on his...  You know.  Nice.  Jim loves Dan Marino, and I think Dan likes him, too.  It's good.  I just wanted to give the history of Jim and Dan Marino. 
[00:43:30]  That's very nice.  Meanwhile, instead of just letting him do it in a more entertaining fashion.  That's a good history.  That's always good.  When does Roland get here?  He is on his way.  He texted me a couple minutes.  He's going to see me.  Well, that's what we're going to find out after the break.  What happened with the Dan Marino booking.  Well, when I called him, he left a message, he came up to me, and he said, what?  Dan Marino.  Dan Marino.  Dan Marino.  But Dan Marino, the publicist of Dan Marino. 
[00:44:00]  He just shakes his head.  I don't know.  He looks down.  He won't look at you.  It's going to be published since a year.  It's going to be DeMarino.  DeMarino.  It's what?  Like, he'll turn three words into one word.  It's great.  DeMarino's publicist.  Dan Marino's publicist?  DeMarino's publicist.  I believe Roland, though, because he told me, like, you stay late on Friday, and he went  through this annoying process with this. 
[00:44:30]  And I think that they just fucked him over on this one.  For whatever reason.  We just want to know why.  I think they fucked him over, and he just, you know, I think it was a little beyond his  control.  Of course.  I believe in him because he told me that I could email that Dan Marino was coming in,  and I always make sure.  Sure.  You know?  And I was like, can I send it to the guys?  He's like, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  He was pretty confident.  I hope you guys had a more professional conversation than that.  Can I send it to the guys?  Professional?  Okay.  We're masculine.  No.  Not with me.  Oh, I just, I saw that you tweeted, uh, Maria Menounos, right? 
[00:45:00]  Jimmy?  I just did, yeah.  Jim Norton on Twitter.  Um, anyone else notice how bad her laugh was?  I didn't notice.  Oh, yeah, apparently that's a common thing.  I didn't notice.  I didn't notice as it was going down.  Yeah.  I guess we were just too busy staring at it.  It's a dolphin laugh.  It's a dolphin laugh.  Yeah.  It drove everyone insane out there.  It sounds like Flipper.  But isn't that her thing?  Like, I guess that she's known for having, like, a fucking...  She acknowledged it on Twitter yesterday. 
[00:45:30]  Dude, did you see the photo?  Because when I'm looking at her face when she's talking, she's very beautiful.  And I'm like, and the name gives it away, but I'm like, she looks Greek.  Like, she has, like, a Jackie Onassis Boston look to her.  Like, that's what her mouth...  Greek girls have, like, a big, beautiful, like, mouth.  But it's not big and clumsy.  It's just sexy.  And I'm like, she looks Greek.  She has Greek features.  And she said she was Greek.  And I'm like, she must have a big vagina.  Because Greek girls have fucking big.  Oh.  She's good in a good way.  Oh, boy.  And then you see someone tweeted me those photos of her bikini bottom slipping. 
[00:46:00]  Yes.  You saw the lip slip?  Oh.  They're calling it the lip slip.  It's not massive, but it looked good.  It was like, fuck, that is sexy.  I think it's still covered up.  A little bit.  A little bit.  There was some stuff going on.  A little stuff going on.  She had a lip slip.  Some stuff.  A little hubba-bubba.  A little hubba.  Look at the lip slip.  Yeah, lip slip.  She's coming out of the water all cool.  That's no idea.  Oh.  Their black bikini bottom is a bit to the side.  There is just a camera awaiting.  Yeah.  No matter what the fuck happens.  I mean, she is fresh out of the water. 
[00:46:30]  By the way, I guess all the privacy advocates crying about Google Glass are objecting to  this.  Right.  Where's all those people?  I don't want them bringing Google Glass at a bar.  You know, when you fucking, you know, put yourself out there and you want to be famous, once  you do, you can't fucking say what people do.  That's what I'm saying.  But as a private citizen, I don't like the fact that people shut up.  Yeah.  So they say that, and they write about celebrities to a certain degree, but basically they're  saying that celebrities have no expectation of privacy no matter where they are.  And you have an expectation of privacy, even when you're in a bar in Seattle. 
[00:47:00]  No matter where you are.  No matter where you are.  Got it.  That's why I love Google Glass.  Good.  You like the Google Glass?  Love it.  Yeah, yeah.  All you fucking douches that want to look at everybody else's windows, now it's going  to be your turn.  You're not going to be able to stop the Google Glass anyway.  That's that technology that's just going to be everywhere.  Video.  Everywhere.  Maria Menounos, baby girl Harlow tweeted, what the hell was with the goat laugh?  Is she even aware she sounds like that? 
[00:47:30]  Ugh.  And then Maria Menounos, I guess, read that tweet and wrote, unfortunately, yes.  So she knows she laughs like a goat.  Do we have it?  Iraq?  No, we can get it.  Yeah, you got to isolate that.  I was hoping.  That laugh.  What?  I was just hoping to hear silence and then the excuse.  I was back there.  And then it gets mad because we called him out on it.  I think it gets so mad, yeah.  I was polishing the chandelier.  It needed polishing. 
[00:48:00]  Because I know sometimes Opie looks over at that little monitor over there to see if  he's there to ask him a question.  It's fucking great.  It's unbelievable.  You got it now?  No, I'll have it when we come back.  Don't talk to Opie like he's stupid.  That's a fair question by the boss.  No.  The boss wants to know something.  We probably should have had that today.  It's a little attitude.  We probably should have had that ready to go today because it was pretty obvious to  a lot of people.  We'll have it after the break, I guess.  Yes.  And we'll talk about some other things.  Thanks. 
[00:48:30]  Thanks.  We should put that flood video on the Facebook page, too.  It's a visual.  But that school getting flooded.  Oh, yes.  I think that's going to be your video of the day.  One door's just fucking getting caved in.  Yeah.  Go to our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  And then there was something else.  Shit.  Thank you, Kenny.  What the fuck was the other thing?  I'll figure it out.  Ah, whatever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[00:49:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Welcome back to the finals of America's Got Genitals.  We've got four contestants left.  And you at home will decide which genitals are America's genitals.  Our judges are here.  Rich Voss.  What should the people at home be looking for in a penis?  You take a nice one about this big, white, cut.  It's got to be cut.  You don't want it to look like a fucking horrible brown turtleneck. 
[00:49:30]  Okay?  All right.  Let's take a look at Travis.  Judges, what are your final thoughts on the genitals?  I'm not sure what that was.  My vote is not.  Look at that.  That looks like a missile.  Nobody likes a ball like that.  It's like a grown man's penis with a young boy's balls.  All right.  Eric is our second finalist.  Eric, why don't you come out here and present your genitals?  You are truly amazing. 
[00:50:00]  I have to admit, you are making me a fan.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  No, you don't think that's a nice penis.  Look at the head.  Look at that.  It's perfect.  The shape and everything, the balls, the contrast.  It's a good presentation.  All right.  Let's keep it moving.  Danny is our third finalist.  Danny, show us what you got.  I'm very confused by you.  Look, I had a lot of hope for you. 
[00:50:30]  And all I saw is a guy with his pants off in a rather small package, quite frankly.  See, that one isn't great because the balls are too tight.  Just an opinion.  And let's bring out our last finalist.  Let's give it up for Kenny.  My boyfriend, absolute perfection.  I am giving you a big yes.  Now that, that's a perfect penis.  You know what it is?  Look at the big balls behind it, you know?  And the head, like, there's a little ridge, so it's, you know, you'll, when you come down 
[00:51:00]  it, you'll hit your, you know, like, you'll know you hit the head.  You know what I mean?  It's fucking, that's a good one.  Okay, the judges have spoken.  We'll find out what America thought after this, when America's Got Genitals continues.  I'm not, I'm not gay.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back.  Go on, sit down. 
[00:51:30]  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more.  Get the fuck off, Batman!  Get the fuck off, Batman!  Oh, I get this one, E-Rock.  The bra was invented 124 years ago today. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, the bra?  Good pickup by E-Rock.  Thank you.  You don't like this?  This is Prince song?  Yeah, this is Prince.  Fucking terrible.  Yeah.  That was all, you know, gimmicky for the movie.  Keep busting.  Keep busting.  Terroi.  Prince is way better than this.  Yeah.  Batman!  It's the Bat Dance, right?  Oh, it sure is.  They were trying to get a Bat Dance thing going.  Did he have a video with this? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah, all that shit.  What was the Bat Dance?  It was all characters dressed up like Batman characters dancing in an alleyway.  Was it a special dance?  It was the Bat Dance.  It was the Bat Dance, Anthony.  What does the Bat Dance entail?  It kind of moves.  Your flop.  Are you flying?  Almost like a bird.  All right, let's take a look.  It's bird-like.  I'm going to take a fucking look now.  All right.  All right.  Remember when that first Batman movie came out and people were wearing the shirts, the 
[00:53:00]  Batman logo?  Oh, yeah.  It's huge.  I had a picture of me and him wearing a sweatshirt.  I used to wear it on stage.  The boys were dead because everyone did.  Well, black guys loved it.  Did they?  Black guys loved fucking Batman.  Loved that logo.  Prince looks like the Joker there.  Well, they made him up like the Joker, huh?  I know.  I know.  Oh, my God.  This is self-serving.  Get to the Bat Dance.  I know.  Is that the Bat Dance? 
[00:53:30]  The Bat Dance was awful.  I hate the Bat Dance.  Unless big fucking fat Nick is doing it.  That's a goof video, right?  I think that's a goof video.  It might have been.  I don't know what that is.  It was terrible.  I want to see the video for the Bat Dance.  Bat Dance.  E-Rock, you got it now?  Yes, I do.  Let me hear it. 
[00:54:00]  You learned that at Emerson?  We learned that at Emerson.  What the fuck is that?  Do you have another one?  Or do you have the same one?  That's the first one I found so far.  All right.  Get a whole montage of those together.  Get a whole bunch of them, please.  You can't find the Bat Dance.  I might have pulled them all.  And that's why you get the weird version, right?  Yeah.  Where you get everyone doing the Bat Dance,  but you don't get to hear the song. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  All right, whatever.  The print's very protective online.  No, it's probably the Batman franchise.  Uh-oh.  Is this it?  Oh.  Fast photo a little.  Sounds like the opening of Venom's Black Metal.  Fast photo a little, because this is always going to be very theatrical,  very dramatic.  Oh, boy.  This looks terrible. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, now Batman and the Joker's dancing.  Get the fuck out, Batman!  Oh, is this douche joy?  Oh, is this?  Get the fuck out, Batman!  You don't like the Bat Dance?  It's so embarrassing, it's hard to watch this.  Go, go, go with the smile!  Why is Batman dancing with the Joker? 
[00:55:30]  They're enemies.  There's half Batman and half Joker.  What the fuck is going on?  Wow.  What a terrible dance.  I am completely embarrassed to be watching this.  Keep busting.  Keep busting.  This is some dumb choreo.  It's so awful.  Just choreographed and then...  It's really bad.  And then what, people were supposed to imitate this?  I don't know, there's smoke all over.  You don't know how they...  What do you do?  What is the Bat Dance? 
[00:56:00]  It's what you're seeing.  It's a little awesome.  It's awesome.  It's not good.  For 24 years ago, it was awesome.  That's some awesomeness right there.  Some horridness.  Yeah.  We got Mike Francesa clip.  What do they do now?  Well, the Rangers fired Tortorella, their head coach there.  The Rangers were knocked out by the Bruins.  And I guess Mike Francesa had the scoop before anyone else.  Oh.  And he interrupts Joe and Evan, whoever the hell they are. 
[00:56:30]  Who are they?  I don't know.  I guess they're on the fan?  On the fan.  To deliver the news in true Francesa fashion.  So that means he's being douchey here, right?  That's Francesa fashion.  Oh, Mike wants to come on.  Hi, Mike.  Hi, Mike.  All right, guys.  Listen, Tortorella's out.  Okay?  Wow.  Oh.  All right.  I don't know what happened.  I know he's out, though.  So Tortorella's gone.  I don't know what happened. 
[00:57:00]  I don't know anything yet.  I'm shocked to have to admit.  I don't know any details of anything.  But Tortorella is out as Ranger coach.  Wow.  That is...  Oh, that's good.  I'm happy about that.  I got to tell you.  I am.  Well, that's stunning.  Goodbye.  That is.  I'm shedding no tears for the loss of John Tortorella.  Okay?  I don't...  I'll further it when I get...  I don't have any other information.  Appreciate it.  All I know is Tortorella is gone.  Fourth time.  Okay, I'll see you guys in a couple minutes.  Thanks, Mike.  I appreciate that, man.  Mike scared me before I didn't know he was yelling at me. 
[00:57:30]  Tortorella gone.  Wow.  Wow.  So Mike had to get this...  I guess he's...  He had to get the scoop.  Yeah.  Instead of just maybe passing the guys a note.  Letting them get the big announcement.  He had to get the scoop.  I love Joe Benigno, though.  I told you when we were off the radio, my whole time was spent looking at prostitutes,  listening to Joe Benigno on the overnights.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I could never listen to...  2.40 on a fan!  He'd be on the overnights, and he had the regular call.  I was fucking...  Every night, I would listen to Benigno and cruise prostitutes. 
[00:58:00]  That sounds like a banner evening.  It was.  It sounds awful.  It was...  I would do sets at the cellar or wherever else.  I would do two or three sets, and then just ride around and look for something that  would suck my dick.  Oh, wow.  I love Joe, man.  I love fucking Benigno.  He does a good job.  He's great.  All right, and then Mike Blass, ESPN, for saying sources in their report.  Because I guess Mike had the scoop.  All right, two things on a busy day. 
[00:58:30]  Number one, as we told you about 15 minutes ago, and now the Rangers have made it official,  John Tortorella.  Yeah, ESPN, sauce.  John Tortorella dismissed this Ranger coach.  Good.  I mean, what a bunch of clowns they are, sauce.  Okay, the Rangers announced it now.  We announced it 20 minutes ago.  The Rangers announced it now.  Sauce.  They have a sauce.  Tortorella dismissed.  The Rangers announced it before they even put their sauce up.  I mean, they are just embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  Okay.  Tortorella out.  Rangers have now told you that.  They have a sauce. 
[00:59:00]  A sauce.  They have a sauce.  A nice moulinese sauce.  A nice meat sauce.  Was he saying sauce?  Yeah.  He said sauce.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Somebody, excuse me.  Someone's correcting me.  Jacqueline Onassis was Irish, French, Scottish, and Greek.  Her second husband was Greek.  Oh, in English.  She had no Greek in her, apparently.  No Greek at all.  I thought she was Greek.  Yeah, that Greek look to her.  She had a little Greek in her.  Aristotle Onassis, boy, he gave her a deep dicking.  Yeah.  And do you know, JFK did not want her, oh, we talked about that with Clinton Hill. 
[00:59:30]  He didn't want her alone with Aristotle Onassis when they were married.  She was supposed to go on some tour.  Yeah, you could tell.  He's like, keep her away.  Like I said, maybe she was doing something.  Even as the president, he's got to look and be like, oh, why can't this guy just fucking  knock it off?  Right.  You just know that the second you get your head blown off in a limo, she's going to be  over with him.  Absolutely.  Big shipping magnate.  Right.  But he was getting his.  He just didn't want her to get hers.  He was getting a lot of action.  Some action. 
[01:00:00]  Some action.  Yeah, he was a fucking rich motherfucker.  What's the song with that?  Action.  Action.  I want to live.  Action.  Action.  I want to give it.  I want to get some too.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  I love the nightlife.  Oh, yeah, nightlife.  Okay.  I got the boogie on the disco.  Go around again.  Action.  I want some action.  I always hated how she said action in that dumb song. 
[01:00:30]  Hey.  All right.  Here we go.  I got the boogie on the disco.  I got the boogie on the disco.  I got the boogie on the disco.  I got the boogie on the disco.  Meow.  She's like a cat.  Please don't talk about love tonight  Your sweet talk won't make it right 
[01:01:00]  Love in a fight is just to bring it down  Yeah, playing this for action  When you've got women all over town  Here it comes  I want some more action  Alright  You know what's fucked up? 
[01:01:30]  This brain is a fucked up thing  I haven't heard this song in God knows how long  And that dumb word action  Pops into my stupid brain today  Why?  The dusty door of some synapse opens up  Isn't that fucked up?  I've been waiting here for a while  Right  How old is that song?  Oh God 
[01:02:00]  70s?  Who sang that?  That was a one hit wonder, right?  Elisa Bridges?  Yeah, that's a one hit wonder right there  Yeah  You know, there's a clip we play  Probably three times a week on this radio show  And yesterday was the anniversary of when the clip was done  Oh yes, yes, yes  And we missed the anniversary  Whoops  We play it fucking ad nauseum 
[01:02:30]  But on the anniversary day we did not play it  Right  You wanna...  I'm gonna guess it's an induction into something  Uh, no  No  No  No  We play it all the time  We play it a hundred times a year  Oh yeah  You have no idea, Jim?  No, I was thinking of Mike Schmidt  Um  Oh  Yeah, but that's not an induction  That was his retirement  Wasn't that his induction into the Hall of Fame?  I thought it was his retirement 
[01:03:00]  Oh, you might be right  That's what I meant  That's what I'm thinking  I think it was 18 years ago  From 18 years ago  I left Dayton, Ohio  Yeah  With two very bad knees  Oh  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player  I thank God the dream came true  I guess that clip is 18 years old now  Oh, God  Yesterday  I think  Or how many years old? 
[01:03:30]  And was it his retirement speech  Or was it when he was going into the Hall of Fame  And then he was kinda going over his life?  So Jimmy might be right  No  Yeah, no, but I could be wrong  That's the first one I thought of  We just love the clip  I don't know  I don't know exactly where it was from  What does it say?  No, that's his...  Okay, when he retired  All right  Announcing retirement  Yeah  Look at that mustache  He could've went right into law enforcement  With two very bad knees  Oh, look at that  There he is  Can I see it, Sam?  All right  Hold it together 
[01:04:00]  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player?  Oh  Oh  Take the cameras  The vultures are just there  Get him crying  I thank God the dream came true  Oh, Mike  Jesus Christ  The man who's worn number 20 for 17 years  Had to walk away  Oh, my God  Wait  Why is he going?  Was that the end of the clip?  Yeah  Because I want to see him walk away  He pulls a gun out of a bag  And shoots himself  I thank God the dream came true 
[01:04:30]  And then he puts his head down as he's bawling  And then he puts his head down as he's bawling  The man who's worn number 20 for 17 years  Had to walk away  And then he's like  However, he leaves behind some impressive numbers  548 home runs  Oh, he's just standing by the locker  Oh, he's looking for a tissue  Oh, he's got a hankie  Oh, look at him  I've never seen that  Yeah  Then he pulls out a hankie  Just leans against the thing and collapses  Collapses and then gets a hankie  We're bastards  Wipe away the tears  Through your tears  Through your tears 
[01:05:00]  There you go  There's something else  There's something else I haven't thought of  I was standing up by the photogs  Through your tears  I'm absolutely crying  Oh, please, I gotta hear it now  For the stupid who?  And I love the who  I gotta hear it  What the fuck is his name?  Bruce Kelly?  Bruce Kelly  I was spacing on his name  Bruce Kelly  Went to go see the who  This was very early when we came to sound  Oh, my God  And who were the DJs that day 
[01:05:30]  That interviewed  Well, that spoke with him  Well, I mean, you had  George  Thank you  George Taylor Morris  Right  Who is no longer with us  Yes  He was a great broadcaster  Always liked him  Yeah  He interviewed us when we were coming back  Yeah  To radio  And  And the redhead that used to share our office  What was her name?  She was the daughter of the broad from  Weakest Link  From Weakest Link  From Weakest Link 
[01:06:00]  She was sexy, that redhead  Yeah, she was  Whatever happened to her?  I don't know  She  As soon as they offered that they were going to transfer them out  She got out  Because she hated us  We kind of started talking to her after a while  Yeah, but it didn't matter  She hated us  She hated us  She hated that we came in and we took over  Whatever happened to the little Oompa?  You know what?  We don't know  I think he's still with the company  But he might be over at Jazz at Lincoln Center  Really?  In a little closet over there  Buddy his name was  Yeah, Buddy  Yeah, so  I guess 
[01:06:30]  What concert were they at?  Was it just a Who show?  Live Aid  Live Aid  Yeah, they put Live Aid back together  It was a Live Aid thing  So I guess they wanted to get the exclusive  Of somebody who was right there watching The Who  And  It was Bruce  And he came over  And started talking  But he lost it  He was so emotional  For The Who  You know what I'm hearing right now?  So many people going  We know!  Oh, I know  But we do it for the newer listeners  And you know what?  It's one of these clips  I could hear it another hundred times 
[01:07:00]  Dude, it's so good  Just hearing this guy losing it  Over fucking  It's from 2005  The Who  I'm just saying we play it a lot  Do we?  Yeah, we get to it  Really?  Yeah, we probably  We probably get it out there  A couple times a year  This might be your nugget for next week  Oh, wow  This could be the Opie and Anthony nugget  This is a good one  This week's nugget on the Opie and Anthony podcast  Episode 3  Now available  Is the sausage  Sausage  Phone call  Sausage 
[01:07:30]  Sausage  Sausage  Alright, let's listen to Bruce Kelly losing it  Over The Who  I'm sorry  I'm absolutely crying  I can't help it  I really can't  This is no fake  You know, the whole moment  Just kind of  Kind of got to me  With that video  With that video  Why are we only doing the short clip?  Yeah  I thought you just wanted to  You're fired  You're fired  You're fired  You're fired  You're fired  With the condescending woman  Yeah  Through your tears  Giving him a what's of it 
[01:08:00]  And then George Teller Morris  Always the professional  But you know he wants to slap him across the face  Oh, yeah  But you know  It was a still real to me moment  Yeah, because George Teller Morris  Would have loved to say  You know the shit I've seen in my fucking career?  Yeah  Yeah  Are you kidding me?  I can see in a rehashed old version of The Who  And he's crying  Right  Well, there was something on the video screens, remember?  Yeah, the Africans starving while The Who sang  And he was just a 14-year-old kid 
[01:08:30]  And, you know, George Morris is saying something about  Well, that's what it's all about  Because he really wants to say  Why don't you just go put a dick in your mouth?  Fucking pansy  Yeah  You blubbering pansy  Blubbering pansy  Fucking  You blubbering 80s fucking music programming  Yes, focus on George Teller Morris  Because you know he's just being a professional here  Yeah  If he was off mic, he would probably say some other things  And what's her name there?  She just wants to be like  What a wanker  Right  You're a fucking wanker 
[01:09:00]  Right  Why would you show that?  Yeah  Because George Teller Morris probably remember the time  That him and Rafter Man were running through the NOM  Fucking covering mass graves  Rafter  And this fucking  And this mushy-eyed sissy is fucking  You can't take fucking  Looking at a geriatric Pete Townsend  Yeah  Trying to get his hand over his head  To faux windmill  Stop it  Alright, you gotta start from the beginning now  Yeah, it's a minute down here  Oh, that's fine  Is this live?  Yes, we're live  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under the phone 
[01:09:30]  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey  Perform these songs after all these years  And still have the full spirit of what they do under control  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player  I'm sorry, I'm absolutely crying  I can't help it  I really can't  This is no fake  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video  Yeah, the video was very powerful  Yeah, yeah, that was 
[01:10:00]  It was two girls, one cup  Very, very powerful  When she starts licking the shit off of the other girl's plate  Very powerful  I'm absolutely crying  The part where they  It looked like a milkshake  But do you hear George Morris throw in that subtle thing?  He said that it's good to see them have under control  He's basically trying to say, get yourself under control  Pull yourself together  And the way he describes it 
[01:10:30]  The consummate professional  It's got the voice  It's unwavering  And then the contrast from going from that  To  Oh, it's awful  Two girls, one cup  Did you back it up, Iraq?  Yeah, back it up a little bit  The video was very powerful  Yeah, yeah, that was  This is very awkward, I'm sorry  But  I mean, you know, it's just the who  I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with the who 
[01:11:00]  Sure  That's it  Sorry  You were seeing them live, I guess that was in color  Yeah  Yeah, they were live on stage  But the black and white was happening on the big screens too  So  Through your tears  Well  So there's two more to go here  Through you and tears  I feel like an idiot  I'm sorry  Really  Hey, look, that's overwhelming  That's what this, you know  That really is what this is all about  There are certain moments that touch everybody  He's just trying to move along 
[01:11:30]  Certain moments that touch everybody  I love him  At least he acknowledged that he knew he was going to cross badly  Oh, man  Did he ever  Oh, God  And to have that just put on tape forever  Played by us assholes  Yeah, but no one else is playing it  No, no  He could have just skated  And anyone else at SiriusXM could pull that little nugget  Nugget  And play it on their show  They choose not to  Oh, is that just so embarrassing  I love it  I just love it 
[01:12:00]  When he's  I'm absolutely trying  No fake  Yeah, this is no fake  No fake  Exactly  Did you touch home base before you said that, you fucking nine-year-old child?  How about broadcasting?  No fakeies  No fakeies  Would you like a tissue?  Okay, thank you  No backs, no backs, no penny tags  Right, exactly  Baby  Whole pissy eyes  Exactly  Now I understand how fun that must have been for my dad  Yeah  Just goofing on a pissy-eyed crying  Imagine if he came out of your balls  How fucking disappointed you'd be 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God  What a classic  What a classic early XM radio moment for us  Absolutely  Whatever happened to that  What's that?  Oh, go, go  I had nothing  Whatever happened to that  That  Remember that chick that we used to  When we'd go to Washington  She would come in  The one with the voice  Yeah, yeah  D  Yeah, whatever happened to her  D?  Huh?  D?  D?  D?  She writes me every once in a while  She writes me every once in a while, too 
[01:13:00]  Yeah  Really?  Yeah  Is she still around?  No, she got let go  No, but  She's doing stand-up or something  What?  Really?  Why don't we have Joe Namath on today?  He's right there  Broadway Joe's at Fox  He's right across the street  Because we got Marino  Oh, we got Marino today  Yeah, we didn't want  One quarterback at a time  Two legendary quarterbacks  Nice  A little much on the football with Marino coming in  Why is Roland hiding in the office?  He knows we want to talk about Jim Namath  Jim Namath  Can he come in real fast? 
[01:13:30]  I know he's listening to us  Jim Namath  Then we'll take a break  And we'll get Jim Florentine in here  Yeah  God  Yeah, whatever happened to her  D.D.  Oh, man  She got in trouble after a couple appearances on the show  Did she?  Well, she was on the  She told  XM Kids  Remember the story she told  Where she woke up like in Vegas or something?  She blacked out when she drank  Fuck, that was a great story  And she woke up in Vegas  Was she married?  I don't know, man  Yeah  And she's telling all this 
[01:14:00]  Knowing that she has a gig on the Kids Channel  Yeah  She woke up in like a gas station bathroom or something in Vegas  Yep  Try to remember the details  She had that like very child-friendly voice  Yeah  And stuff  And she was telling these horrific stories  I was so disappointed when I met her  Oh, yes, Uncle Paul  I could only imagine  I would talk to her on the phone for hours  Roland  Hello  What's up, buddy?  What happened with Dan Marino? 
[01:14:30]  What happened there?  Walk us through this from the beginning  I think it's just a case of  The guy he hired overbooked him  Overbooked?  Wait, so these guys just hire, like, what?  Publicists for a run?  For a different  Because he's not in the public eye a lot  So he probably just hires them for a different project  He's in the public eye a lot  During football season  He's on every week  Whatever he promotes, though  So he pays them  He's probably on, like, 20 Sundays  Sometimes they don't have a publicist on retainer, though  If you're not doing anything  You won't pay a publicist five grand a month for nothing 
[01:15:00]  So this guy, he overwhelmed  He got very overwhelmed  And they way overbooked him  I was getting more bookings in  And just pick TV instead of radio  Yeah  Because he goes, oh, yeah, we'll see you tomorrow  Then midnight comes  Oh, my God, something came up  And he knows TV  So just, like  Just a shithead  We lost out to TV again?  We're the fucking retarded child of media  Sure  We're not, like, the big, handsome TV 
[01:15:30]  No  We're the lowly fucking thrown-off-a-mountain-in-Sparta fucking radio  And also, too, the guy probably way overbooked the schedule  That probably Marino saw that and said, what is this?  Like, he probably said, yes  Who could we cut out of this thing?  Oh, how about the Opie and Anthony show?  Or it could be even the time for the morning  Because he came here, like, at 3.30 in the afternoon  Right  He needs his beauty sleep  What embarrassing product does he pitch?  AARP, I guess  AARP?  Yeah, these quarterbacks pitch somewhere 
[01:16:00]  Weird shit  God, it's just insane  You got that  You got the fucking  Theisman?

Yeah  1989  Oh, Jesus  20  24 years  24 years ago 
[01:17:00]  Okay, so 24 years ago  Sorry about that  So, you could say 42 years ago  Right  He left Dayton, Ohio with two bad knees  Right  All right  And a dream  Right  Here's the line  18 years ago  I left Dayton, Ohio  With two very bad knees  Fuck  And a dream  And a dream  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player  Under the photogs  I thank God  The dream came true 
[01:17:30]  Through your tears  Through your tears, right  Through your tears  Joe Theismann  I'm Joe Theismann  And no matter what stadium I broadcast from  I would always have to find the closest bathroom  Just in case I had that sudden urge to go  My prostate was giving me fits  Fits  Then I heard about Super Beta Prostate's nationwide million bottle giveaway  And I got a free bottle  What a difference it made  I don't have to go  Why would you let the world know you have a shitty dick?  Oh, it's his prostate  I know  His prostate's giving him fits 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, he makes money  I let people know for free  At least he's fucking telling people for money  He's so he held out  He might want to get together with Tony Saragusa  Oh, you know what?  Right  Get some of those pads  You got Joe Theismann trying to keep that piss in you  And then you got Saragusa sopping it up when it does dribble out  Yeah, he's soaking it up for you  Yeah, that's beautiful  It could be a great morning radio show  You fucking  You ladies don't know what a chore it is

The sheer debauchery 
[01:20:30]  And fucking  No  No sacred cows here  Right  You rock  Wow  So, it's official  No Dan Marino today  No  You see all the shit I brought in today  To get signed?  You niggled it?

[01:22:00]  Thrown from a penis  Oh, yeah  Boner pills  Jimmy Johnson  Dallas Cowboys coach  That's a biggie  Oh, yeah  Yep  Alright  It's odd  They just hired these sports guys  For fucking  The weirdest commercials  Boner pills  What is that?  Jimmy Johnson?  I'm Jimmy Johnson  And I recently became  The spokesperson for Extends  The number one  Mail Enhancement Tablet  Even though I'm the winner 
[01:22:30]  Of four collegiate  And professional football championships  And have a sportscasting career  I've been surprised  At the one big question  Guys ask me these days  Does Extends really work?  Can you believe it?  So here's my answer  It works for me  And since Extends  Oh  Talking about his dick  It works for them too  Most men want to perform  The best they can  But he's wording it  In a way that  Like you can't prove it  So they can't get sued  Exactly  It works for me  So if you want  That maximum performance edge  Every day  I say go long  With Extends  Go long 
[01:23:00]  I love the idea of cheering people  In the back  And like pom pom  Then he awkwardly threw the football  Nobody in a producer  And now you've got the visual  Of Jimmy Johnson  And his churchy penis  Walking in the bedroom  That long thick dick  Get ready  Get ready  Here comes the Jimmy Johnson  Dick what Extends  Does that shit work?  It works for Jimmy Johnson  I've never heard of it  I remember that commercial  But I haven't heard of it since  No they used to have the commercial  With that guy  Yeah the smiling guy 
[01:23:30]  The smiling guy  And his wife would be like  Bing  It would look like a 50's  Kind of family  Thing  Innuendoful  Oh  That's what those commercials were  Oh  Yes they were  Those blueberries look good today  Damn those blueberries look good  I do not like a blueberry  They look cloudy  They have perfect clouds  Blueberry clues  We should do a show  Just fucking replaying 
[01:24:00]  All the goofballs  All the potential nuggets  Yeah  Yeah  Potential nuggets  Can we dedicate a show  To Opie and Anthony Nuggets?  What is that?  I don't know  For these doctors  Dr. Sweet  And Dr. Roberts  And these two boards  Have said  No we're not going to make an exception  We're going to continue  To this  Adhere to this rule  Where children go last  In America  And die the most  Alright that sounds like  A good point  Why don't we 
[01:24:30]  Take a break  That's terrible  Completely out of context  Totally  Right okay  Could be a new bit  Yeah  Jim Florentine next  But first  These messages  When you need radio gold  He's the one that you call  With happy movie reviews  Wears his shirts extra small  The one you can count on  The book a guest for a session  But ends every single sentence  He says in a question  No pronunciation  Soft spoken and mumbles  Just try and put him behind the mic 
[01:25:00]  And he crumbles  Babbling moron  That's for you to decide  Bonne deuce  Bonne deuce  Check him out Friday wide  It's rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'  That was good  I mean  At action  suspense  The O.P. and Anthony Channel  Channel Channel Channel Channel  On Sirius XM  Here at the Church of Norton  We believe in preaching the true word of the Lord

[01:29:00]  there's nothing worse than being someone in the public eye trying to hide something because  then you just become mr diplomat you don't want to make any fucking waves all right and that's exactly  what the situation is what you mean well you know when you ever see somebody that's got something  that's trying to hide it but uh other people know about it and stuff and then you can't get into a 
[01:29:30]  battle with somebody because you're afraid that they're gonna pull out that atomic bomb on you  nah but that's you know like we do know things we're fine oh yeah yeah yeah yeah we just know  things we're not in fighting mode right now what  oh yeah oh yeah yes yes yes  the universal wow wow you would be great at charades i am the best yeah pictionary you must be the

[01:33:00]  might i forgot about that oh that might have been well i don't think we would ask him about that  i don't even know about it i would just be like ask football questions yeah it's official too and  the kid's young from uh only a few years ago yeah maybe like well that i think like within the last  ten yeah oh oh i think the kid's maybe seven years old yeah but yeah but yeah love child we weren't  gonna fucking say no i forgot all about that like what kind of show i don't know i'm just saying that  that could not not from dan because dan you know he'll just say man it happened and whatever you

[01:34:30]  i took that misery and turned it into something i thought was comedy i'm not a big fan of louis i love  louis was very nice to us yeah louis was great love louis and i understand he he looked ridiculous  on that diving show that was fantastic that's what it comes down to you do all those years and stand  up and then you look like a giant yellow beach ball oh god yeah i'd like to a pool and you can't 
[01:35:00]  even get out of the pool after you hit the water you know i love that he did that show because he has  he does a show in vegas he has his own room right and when he's on the road i fill in forms i get to go  to vegas oh yeah oh really yeah he had louis anderson does it at the palestine you know it's  not really he didn't pick me personally they just throw me in there so no he was that was me and jim's  for like a pretty much our first tv appearance absolutely well i did friday night videos but that  was more legit yeah and uh it's when we met dice me and jim's yeah we shared a room with the 
[01:35:30]  fucking windham bellage me you lenny and fucking french easy does anyone have my daughter's cell phone  number i want to say hi oh boy that's shocking yeah you're being shocking well she wants shocking  we'll give her shocking trust me we need to give her incredibly why she doesn't like me  she doesn't know she just went over her little list  what is that the obi and anthony show what are they shocked guys i i i i don't know what they do 
[01:36:00]  i i i have no idea i don't know who they are i i don't know  is it it said like they were they shocked i have no idea stop asking me i have no idea  never heard the show god damn it that is so fucking fun oh god so funny all right 
[01:36:30]  we can't play clips from his show i guess who gets in trouble we don't in the end we don't get  in trouble whoever pulls the clips yeah oh that's what how that works yeah yeah someone said that uh  that was going down so during the commercials uh because the online feeds behind we went over there  to hear it ourselves how dare you she wasn't bashing i mean you'd have to know whatever that's her 
[01:37:00]  but she was just speculating i guess that we're shock jocks she's speaking just a little shittily  though yeah yeah yeah yeah she sounds uh inebriated oh yeah i think she always does uh travis said  she's you know without booze or pills or anything she sounds like that all the time  like this is very drawn out and are you guys as shocking as my face is oh now that is bashy what 
[01:37:30]  see that's bashing because you know i didn't character oh like mr imus i didn't character see  you gotta get some more cactus on the show like mr imus if i'm gonna get a picture i better get it  now oh this isn't gonna go down you better get it in the hallway oh we're not in the mood  aren't you worried what she thinks of you though i don't give a  look it's gonna be great i have a feeling she's in here then if we trash her with her in here it's 
[01:38:00]  more interesting let's just do it when she's here because if it goes great great if it goes bad i will  try my best i will tell you right now but i will guarantee it'll go horribly wrong because she's  that type of person she's very confrontational wherever she goes and always has been if you  know anything about her her father hated her she she and her daughter don't fucking you know that's  happened you know have a relationship oh boy that's shocking leave that some people in here that 
[01:38:30]  doesn't take any responsibility for anything along with the other family members huh they turned out to be  fine we'll see what happens i i don't know what i don't know i don't know  oh me and anthony they do something like is this shocking are they gonna ask me shocking questions  i don't know if they even talk i don't know what it is i i've never seen them in my life i don't  know who they are i don't know what they do move on move on let's move on let's move on let's move on 
[01:39:00]  move on tell them fred all right uh we will uh move on to adam levine fucking adam levine does not  have to fucking um say he he doesn't hate america oh look it's right there right as we speak oh poor  sore loser at worst uh he was evincing uh his true feelings about this country either way he's a crap  weasel because initially his defense was that this was he was being funny and he tweeted and we have 
[01:39:30]  this at twitchy he tweeted the definition of humorless in response to his critics and now he's  changed his story to say that really he was just frustrated with the entire process no i think if you  look at at this man's history he has a history of being a left-wing progressive and he's out of the  closet about us they're gonna fucking bash him for that the fact is everyone knows what adam levine  meant uh that night two of his guys got fucking uh voted off uh the voice right yeah so he was 
[01:40:00]  frustrated because it was obvious that they were very talented uh kids the american people voted them  off so he was like i hate this country meaning jesus you know right that's all and he shouldn't  have to explain what that meant it's not literal it's not funny but she has to take the shots because you  know he he leans the other way it again michelle i hate that broad it's not i thought you would like  her i thought she's on your team no she trashed her stupid twitchy trashed me like twice once 
[01:40:30]  called me a liberal i'm like you really did your research huh right yeah i'm quite a liberal that  twitchy site that she is in charge of her assholes but she's one of those people that just  waits for anybody to say something she can be outraged about right and then she'll be outraged  just licking her chops for ten minutes spin this to be outraged but yeah she's a big conservative  like yeah yeah yeah yeah pose yeah she's a fucking twat michelle malkin yeah she's a  fucking twat so what did what did levine say that he hates america like under his breath or something 
[01:41:00]  he was just like i hate this country i hate this country meaning he was frustrated that his guys got  voted off because it was pretty obvious they probably should have been voted off i don't know i don't  really watch the voice so but everyone knows what he meant by it yeah but of course then they have to jump  on at these bloggers and these and this twitchy fucking thing and this michelle broad and it's  the prime it's the prime now he has to explain context and then he had to explain himself and  come out and say look i i i don't hate this country you say that you say shit like that like i hate this  fucking shit oh i hate when that that's all he did out of frustration there's no context anymore we 
[01:41:30]  were talking about um that that kid that got suspended from the school bus he was on a school bus  and he took out a plastic gun from from a lego set you know you know the guns that are like the  size of like a quarter yeah that you put in the lego guy's hand he had that and he was showing a  friend and and some kid was like he has a gun on the bus and they showed like it's like this is the  gun well zero tolerance policy we have so can't you take into consideration what it is and and not assume 
[01:42:00]  that that that suspending him is going to have any bearing on any future shootings all right it's the  most ridiculous fucking thing a no tolerance policy and another thing that they do they they that uh  guy i guess at disneyland he threw a um a soda bottle dry ice and water and he screwed the top  on threw it in a garbage pail and it goes boom when enough of the gas builds up inside it's like a thing  you do it's not a bomb it's something you do on your fucking backyard when you you've had some dry 
[01:42:30]  ice because they you got some steaks delivered or something you know right it's just something  you do it's not a bomb and uh they arrested him one million dollar bail wow and and the news is  covering it as blast at disneyland no one injured or killed in in explosion at disney would you  fucking stop it again context they're trying to fucking scare everyone right the fucking the 
[01:43:00]  police are and and the court a million dollar bail stop it was just a goof it's a joke thing it's  fucking it's it's is he an employee of disney yeah he was an employee of disney so why did he do it  because he's he is an idiot right he's an asshole where do you do it too he threw it in a garbage  pail in public town in public uh yeah i guess in the toontown no come on but that's the reason i  can't carry stink bombs anymore because you know you know it's not just gas and people gonna run 
[01:43:30]  and think it's a friggin you know terrorist attack yeah i mean i used to drop them everywhere yeah  it's everywhere possible and then he'd go back in and it was i don't know how you do i laugh and we  walk back in and you'd be right there with people they'd be like why and you're like why would anyone  do that i don't know yeah why would anyone do this i go how childish is just somebody to carry around  a stink bomb seriously i mean this club is over 21 who is walking around with stink bombs jimmy still carries  stink bombs oh yeah we do yes yes oh yeah biological just figured out another way to 
[01:44:00]  uh yeah but i yeah um so i can't carry them i can't drop them anymore because of that  no they'll do you like them always i remember going in the macy's right on fifth avenue and dropping like  three right at christmas time whenever it was christmas shopping just ruin their good time the news  would be there in a second now and they would talk about like a well a suspicious event there's noxious  gases they're the police and fbi have been called is this a terror event yeah and back in the old days  it was just like all right open the fucking doors and get some janitors here to wave some shit to you 
[01:44:30]  know it was nothing we've gotten to the point where it's so ridiculous now what things have to be taken  for what they are and in context or else you just lose your fucking minds a million one million dollars  bail right there are people that kill literally kill people that have less than a million dollars  bail it's it's insane and believe me the guy like i said the guy's an idiot you obviously shouldn't have

[01:53:00]  what i heard they gave him the boot no no why would they find brewer it doesn't make sense budget  oh wow oh that's a stupid question it's money maybe because they put me on the payroll that's it  that's right making the big bucks right yeah i knocked brewer out i guess  you're gonna get that summer home my two-hour show once a week that's right  jim's seven to nine are you seven to nine five to seven five to seven okay eastern every day  no every thursday oh every thursday you just said that yeah and then they could replay like four 
[01:53:30]  times very cool good good man i'm psyched yeah kids good kids good yeah i just did uh i just i just  did a episode of californication oh no way yeah wow i used to love that show yeah i went out to l.a last  week did like three days on the set how was it it was great man the company's  he's a great dude yeah we love him he comes in here all the time he's awesome he's he's so down  to earth and pam uh all dinners and adlon adlon yeah that was on she's still on it yeah yeah she's  great she's awesome she's amazing i just stopped watching the show for whatever reason i didn't think 
[01:54:00]  it was bad or anything i just like tapped out i should jump back on that yeah she's a great actress  you played a pimp yeah nice how were your bitches i just had one i brought over to and uh it was great  though but being on a set for like those shows they they should have like 40 times the same  scene oh from every angle and by the end of the day you're just like i don't even know the lines  anymore yeah i'm just i was up a few times oh wow did you make any mistakes absolutely 
[01:54:30]  in the morning i was on fire i had them down everything but by the afternoon you're doing the  same over and over again and those guys are you know they're trained professionals they know their  shit right you think that you're like better at you would think no but because they don't mean  anything at the end by you if you do them so many times and i would just keep the guy like three times  in a row i forgot like a line right after i go i got to do that again i i felt bad i'm like oh man  i gotta be like what the fuck is what are we doing with this amateur some guys have that though they're 
[01:55:00]  better on their first oh some guys are better on their first or second take yeah like they said when  they did blue collar like prior and caught the off in koto hated each other because like prior was  i think a first take guy second take he was on fire yeah but uh guys like harvey kytel needed a  couple times and prior didn't want to deal with those and that just caused a lot of strife so i  mean it's some guys just take a little while but stanley kubrick like his films he'd make guys seem  like tom cruise walking through a door make them do it like a hundred and ten times and not get many  direction just do it do it again do it again go again how do you go through that many scenes then later 
[01:55:30]  and go yeah that's the one i don't know who looks at that footage yeah it's kubrick and indubit  indubitably that's right yes courtney law hi how are you courtney how are you good what's going on  have a seat yeah huh um yeah what happened jim brewer was he was like has she left yet because i have a  story and he's on snl and he told this story it's total so i went back in there and clarified it 
[01:56:00]  oh oh jim brewer right yeah brewer yeah yeah we know him pretty well an snl story that just wasn't  true really about you yeah people always have this sort of like courtney stole my grandmother's wedding  ring and then menstruated on my tc sheets and then she burned the building down kind of thing so um and  then she punched my grandma people will usually air to the side of you probably did something outrageous  though yeah yeah i mean even howard was i mean this picture he goes see you're you're you're not wearing 
[01:56:30]  underwear i'm like that is a thin strip of cotton oh there's a difference a uh a little sneak shot  that was taken no it was a stage diving those days oh okay yeah so you covered up the goods with  something i always covered up the good you covered up the goods i don't want to air down there you  were you you must have been caught out though what aren't you supposed to air it out well when you're  in the bath that's it yeah i figured being constant wearing like i mean my move i only have one rock  move is up my foot up on the monitor so you know you can sort of see up and thicker the line of 
[01:57:00]  cotton is the more safe i feel right well yeah all right i get it waxed yeah yeah yeah you know you  don't want you know sticking out of it wires unruly yeah yeah unruly like the black cover there is  there is a band that's called l7 they're awesome sure and i got i i this is like coming to the collective  and now it's me but i didn't do it i didn't think of this this girl named danita sparks i grew up with 
[01:57:30]  her uh actually her bass player jennifer finch she's my oldest friend still has the same phone  number i don't know what city area code but it's four seven five oh one one nine it's been that for  37 years okay so if i'm ever in jail that is the number that's the one you have memorized yeah anyway  finch um and danita they were um at redding in england and they were getting bottled and food and  mud and and danita was on a really quite heavy menses and she reaches into her jeans and she just took 
[01:58:00]  this tampon and she threw it into the crowd it was it's a hundred thousand person crowd legendary right  that's right brilliant i wish i had thought of it that's rocking so this guy comes up to me about  i don't know two weeks ago and he goes yeah i got hit in the face with your tampon at the play  oh man i didn't do it man they'll attribute that to you because i mean i love the accolade but i  didn't think of it yeah yeah that's a big fetish for a lot of guys too it's a really weird one that's 
[01:58:30]  one i don't get hit by ellie tampons are a fetish she was having a really heavy flow and then she could  just see the blood spurting oh man yeah but i mean if your fucking drummer gets hit in the head with a  hard bottle like you gotta fight with what you got fight with your yeah yeah just take your pearl  out there and now you don't deny that you you were pretty wild back in uh what they called the day 
[01:59:00]  right um i'm wild in the day but you know there's this great flower bear quotes he wrote the book of  madame belveret um it is wild in my work bourgeois my life oh yeah yeah does that fit you yeah that  fits me to a t right now yeah oh really so you've you've in your personal life what you've kind of  mellowed out bourgeois a bit bourgeois gracious living bourgeois gracious living but still when you're on  stage and stuff you're you're yeah but i don't stage i have anymore no because i mean the fingering and 
[01:59:30]  everything else i was trying to prove the point it was like okay better could do this you know  kirk could do this cordell could do this and they get you like football heroes and i kept trying to  prove the point and i never broke any my my limbs never got broken right but uh my clothes would all  be off wow guys rope you pulling pushing you back up yeah i mean there's pictures it's just very violent  and but i just liked it i was like are you gonna rape me you're gonna rape me it was just some sort 
[02:00:00]  of like wow game you play i don't know so guys that guys actually would finger you or she would  yeah crowd serve but i didn't really feel it because i was also fighting off my arms getting  broken it's getting squeezed you got to prioritize the uh body parts you don't feel the finger  neck getting twisted right so you if you're if you're mellow in your personal life do you does  that does that make you want to go back to work because you kind of missed that i'm touring 
[02:00:30]  i started touring on the 20th i can't wait where's where's the tour start um it's a tertiary market  tour meaning it's like small venues um like stone penny and house of blues and like things like that  right um and then i'm doing this television show which shall not be named um that i thought i would  never do tv ever ever you know like tv's the devil i mean i remember walking around memphis with woody  harrelson um like 14 years ago during that larry flint movie and unfortunately his name was woody the 
[02:01:00]  bartender as well and it was like walking around with a beetle wow yeah and i had this one girlfriend  who became a soap opera star and i went to a mall with her and the these ladies were so they were like  cattle they were very large and in sweat outfits and she was mobbed yeah yeah all for being on tv  from being on a soap opera yeah but you're recognizable and they didn't know her name as an  actress and yeah and anyway tv has just never been my thing particularly what we call reality tv or 
[02:01:30]  whatever and this isn't like some e-channel courtney's life thing what tv show is it i can't tell you  oh man because it's a network thing so it's a big thing is it something that's already on or is  it brand new no it's already on oh maybe maybe like you know american idol i can't i just can't  judge or something i just can't say the judge on american idol that's a big game wow you're gonna be  on american idol that's great that's a great gig i did not say that's a great gig wow we got a scoop 
[02:02:00]  today is that this show is looking for yeah i read the demographic thing they're looking for is  disaffected i love that word oh disaffected females and homosexuals and therefore there is  only one person to call that would be me wait so what's show the voice no i get the cutters  the american idol that is true what happened to my mic it's on it's on no you muted me 
[02:02:30]  no way you're silencing me no is there are your headphones you're silencing your headphones with  your name who's opie and who's anthony opie anthony who do you think looks like anthony out of these  two i don't know i don't know no really it's uh we didn't mute you maybe your headphones i'm  silenced at the land maybe your headphone uh jack i can smell the lambs maybe your headphone jack  cheap perfume it's all american idol that's a great gig i did not say  see that or the voice i'm saying yeah i wanted yeah okay i couldn't get on the voice if you pay i 
[02:03:00]  mean it's not the voice but she's not saying no to american i'm not saying anything american  they're knocking everybody out what's the dance show to uh dance with the stars because you know  because my because i'm sorry my pole work gives me so much you know i enjoyed that greatly that you  just did that capacity did you have the goods uh covered up very covered up all right they're  covered up yeah yeah with a thin strip with a very thin strip a very thin yeah that was a 
[02:03:30]  she's not denying american idol they're getting rid of everybody they really are that'd be a great  gig that would be a good one they like someone that's outspoken yeah a little outrageous yeah  they like that on the show yeah yeah perfect for that show you'd be honest yep  that's how it's been too soft because nobody's been honest on that show for a while yeah and you  need don't you think like like badass is supposed to go on there and be badasses and then they go 
[02:04:00]  on there it's butterflies flying at their asses it's like yeah come on yeah you know look at the  world like he was nice they were overly nice well your buddy there uh howard he he uh is a bit  soft on some of the acts i guess you can't just wheel in there and go like yeah you can't just go  in there though and be like he just had a total grace kelly to you know he had a totally non-controversial  fantastic yeah discussion yeah i hope i get invited back so you think that on the show you'll 
[02:04:30]  be more outrageous and you'll speak the truth if someone's bad on american idol yeah what show it  was you know i'm not saying i'm just saying whatever whatever whatever show you're judging  speak the truth right so if someone's lip-syncing or all that stuff you're gonna you're gonna call  them out billboard awards once and i refused to lip-sync and it was a huge mistake oh really yeah  because there's like this little delay and because i thought it was just can i say i thought it was  gay yeah homosexual fans i love you i do say gay sometimes okay um i thought it was just 
[02:05:00]  blame and um we actually sounded worse wow doing accu tuning back then and whatever and i think kid  rock said something on the billboard awards about people that lip-sync but he's got a lip-sync we all  lip-sync now yeah on those shows you have to or you sound like oh man that's kind of why does it sound  like like shit why can't they get that sound like do a sound check early in the day yeah yeah i don't  know it does suck you ever hear the chili peppers without anthony's voice accutuned oh 
[02:05:30]  not going there sorry he was well you know accutune is something they do live is that like no no no  they can do it live but it it's where if you're hitting flats and sharps they can it rounds it up to  where it's supposed to be yeah it's where it's supposed to be it's uh but they did with mary j blige's  voice in my opinion mary j blige had this fantastic phenomenal soulful wounded great voice and lately  what i hear is really accutuned yeah it's like barbie where are you and have you used that um for me 
[02:06:00]  yeah hell yeah yeah i'm white you know i don't hear  you're not going to do that but the live shows you do you it's all it's all real you don't use  yeah of course but anthony kiedis doesn't sound great live huh if you take that away without 
[02:06:30]  insulting one of my oldest friends who let me use his rehearsal space before i even had a band  and therefore i wouldn't even be here without flea that anthony's voice is slightly banal  without a little some something like reverb well when they first started he wasn't even  on key a lot of the times that was kind of the way the music was written too and then later on they got  very popular it was a more of a uh a pop thing and it needed to be yeah on key and everything right 
[02:07:00]  yeah he was very loose with his being either flat or sharp with a lot of things there was like  something that was there was like a lack of personality for a while yeah yeah yeah yeah  and when you're in studios you hear people's voices naked uh-huh which i mean you hear your own voice  naked it's embarrassing enough but when hearing other people's voices naked it's like taking a look  at them showering yeah i think that's why you can never like tattling on it isn't really cool you  can never really get the the impact of what people are going to hear on a record yeah you can't really 
[02:07:30]  tell what people are going to hear on a record because you hear it as you're singing it and you  hear just bear through the cans and every time you listen to that song even through when they're  processing it unless you're in love with yourself you can't well yeah but who is are you really well  would you hear yourself back does it usually sound better or worse than you first thought it was  going to sound like if you listen back to a tape it's like wow i thought it was worse oh it sounds better  than you thought yeah sounds fantastic i think i'm hot i'm sorry i'm awesome what do you think of 
[02:08:00]  amanda bynes you tweeted her right oh yeah that thing um i think she likes the word ugly a lot yeah  she is that for everybody it's like what's that about listen i was 14 i was so bloody ugly and i  thought it was kate moss i chased this guy named mark rennie was the hottest photographer in portland around  convinced him i gotta show you guys these pictures they're so ugly um you know i had this big schnoz  and i had like blusher on like this and i'm going i'm wearing white gloves and black and white thing 
[02:08:30]  and i'm like this like making new wave faces oh nice voguing and i am so homely and i think i'm  as a gap in my teeth and i thought it was the hottest thing in the world and i was 180 pounds wow so if  someone calls me ugly it sort of rolls off my back because like it's not about looks it's about  attitude i mean you get laid on attitude that's but didn't you think that was kind of shitty because  you kind of like you didn't say anything bad to her what i said back to is you misunderstood me 
[02:09:00]  and well your tweet was get it together dude i think the first was something like that  get it together dude because it's so crazy yeah yeah of course and and marijuana isn't a drug come  on and clearly marijuana is a drug um at least all the drugs and then there's then there's this whole  thing about like disney kids just like they're not educated look at how she writes um you know i'm not  educated either but i'm at least autodidactic at least i try and read flaubert or do you know what i  mean to pronounce it correctly um and um they're they have no parental infrastructure and they just 
[02:09:30]  get it like after they're not nubile anymore or useful they're sort of waylaid they just lose it  yeah and then we all pick on them she comes up and enjoy it well we love a train wreck  yeah who doesn't love a train model your thing on low hand man like right yeah and we do look at  it until something tragic happens and then everybody's like oh you know she should have had help and  this but meanwhile everyone was piling on the dog pile like that yeah uh you kind of went through 
[02:10:00]  a period in time though where you were honestly you were looked at like that like the crazy chick  everything i still kind of am that's why i want to do this television show because there are people  in lubbock texas that still think i'm on a stretcher in 2003 going to bellevue for crack it's like  you guys that was 10 years ago and after 72 hours of bellevue trust me you're never doing crack  you don't want to go back do you think that people will change their opinion of you like  after they see you with the young contestants and stuff like that interacting do we talk about 
[02:10:30]  contestants especially on a network a regular network like you know a real network not even  cable because that's right even though the ratings are down it's still a big show guys are i mean come  on yeah do not get me in trouble what do you think that they'll change your opinion after they see  what your next project i don't know i can only be myself but don't you like that's not a bad image  to have because it's interesting people always want to see what you're doing it's like yeah  i just have a problem cursing yeah oh is it right and no they do a live show too there's got to be 
[02:11:00]  a delay that could be the problem yeah that would be a little delay a lot yeah so when you do the  live show for american idol that could be a problem right they'll probably say don't say yeah yeah they  might have to put a delay on for you but i'll tell you courtney it's really gonna help it's gonna  help you it's gonna help you live dates get courtney it's definitely gonna help your live dates  because i saw with steven tyler when i went to see aerosmith after he was on the show how many  more people like younger people guys bringing their kids and stuff to the show so it's definitely going  to help if you want to get back out there do whole or your solo stuff i want to i want to put out 
[02:11:30]  here new music yeah it's going to be huge for you you need coffee i i want blonde that's been it's  it's called blonde sweet and i know the blonde coffee from starbucks yeah i know it no no no but i made  up the word before starbucks did you so you should sue them what what are you doing i actually had  a lawsuit with howard schultz can i say something we love you you do yeah we thought we were going  to knock it along for some weird reason why i don't know you hear the stories over the years 
[02:12:00]  yeah that it burned down your grandma's house and then all that the thing is there's rats all over  that like ratting and stuff like that so uh somebody had said oh uh courtney's bashing you on  howard now you weren't bashing you're just like oh you just don't know right right you just don't  know us but you know how people are especially on like twitter and stuff they're just like uh you  could say something and it could be the most innocent thing it's like yeah that person's bashing what  are they like i said what are they like are they shock jocks are they like right right like coming for  your crowd right right right right i mean howard knows howard yeah yeah exactly we go way back on howard 
[02:12:30]  you smell really good you do i mean is it she's and i mean this like in a complimentary way  it reminds me of what ozzy wears it smells good but a feminine version of it it smells  oh you know what's interesting about that it's called um back in black and it is the top note  is tobacco and that's kind of rocks well and then the second note is cherry and then third note is  vanilla no i want to say pussy but um but can i have a coffee yeah we got someone getting 
[02:13:00]  you uh yeah iraq's kidding what do you want um like lots of milk and lots of sugar lots of  milk and lots of sugar our coffee here sucks though can we go to starbucks they got the  little they can make starbucks in the back coffee it's fine you sure all right don't mind some  coffee yeah so courtney is this these live dates is this a solo band or is this whole this is i'm  calling it courtney love okay so but it's it's my guitar player miko and i would take melissa back in 
[02:13:30]  a second but i'll never take eric back oh why why what happened with you and eric he took 74  guitars from my storage 18 of them were curts they're left-handed and then when he gets he needs  money he sell he has sold um like kurt went to england and got all these marshall stacks like  seven out of ten marshalls are lemons so for a guy with perfect pitch like kurt you know and miko  who's in my band now going to the marshall factory and getting the non-lemons it's a big thing 
[02:14:00]  me i don't give a shit i don't have perfect pitch me and anthony you know so anyway uh they say hole  on one side nirvana on the other side and he sold them oh and then he sold like a headstock that  curt had broke for like 100 grand and you know it's like there's this guy in bc who collects stuff  and he's a bit gross like he collects like syringes he collects pill bottles like cool paul allen also 
[02:14:30]  has 45 000 plus items that came that are like basically the contents of me and francis and kurt's  entire home and that's a long story and i don't want to make allegations against paul allen on your  radio show because he's got more lawyers than i do oh boy oh boy but um wait but how would he get that  stuff i gotta ask you well i can tell you but then the lawyers would be i'd have a lawyer because  that's a lot potentially walked out potentially a lot of money there obviously and yeah and the 
[02:15:00]  less i talk about it probably the more um discreetly and it will be to get that out of there but you  gotta be out of your mind about it obviously um i'm pissed i'm pissed that mostly i'm pissed that  that the guitar tech who was really sweet and nice um we found out that he has 16 so there's 38 kurt  there's only 38 kurt guitars in the world and he has so eric has 17 we have 12 and then ernie has 
[02:15:30]  the remaining x amount in a storage space in washington that he loans out to paul allen's museum  and it's a matter and he did a uh deposition in canada they got no press and it's really a matter  of finding out um proving that paul's sister jody knew about it because jody allen kind of put it  together if she didn't know about it she didn't know about it but how do you how is it like it's 
[02:16:00]  like it's almost like in the holocaust when they stole paintings and sold them right they were they  were eventually returned family the emp music project to the family they came to my house  and this guy peter blackett we use the curator there he showed me pictures of things like i said  needles spoons pill bottles you know things you don't want on display and asked me and i answered  the door this is 1998 so he died in 94 so this is four years later and i answered the door in his  long jaws kurt's launch house he goes oh you're wearing artifacts i'm like no i'm wearing my dead house 
[02:16:30]  oh my god like what and then he wanted a bunch of stuff and i figured paul is really rich i'm like  okay give me a foundation i'll give you some stuff and they weren't playing ball and then i put everything  in storage with my name on it so it said courtney love which is like a big fucking red flag and then  sometime in 03 the name got changed to a corporate name and it went in arrears after 90 days and they  did an auction a public auction oh my god but there's a good part to it which is somebody was 
[02:17:00]  so stupid they left their real name uh-huh so were they saying you weren't paying your your monthly  storage bill yeah they changed it to a corporate name and what was the monthly storage bill like what  was it was a couple hundred bucks a month a month and uh and so for that they they they change  so the the this this whoever this person is paid something like 1500 bucks for 18 holds wow 
[02:17:30]  i got everything and francis asked me recently for this chair of her dad's and i'm like i don't have  it oof it's an experienced music project so i don't see that on stories we'll see how that goes  okay well it's amazing bobby fisher the chess player he had his he had stuff in storage valuable  stuff yeah and somehow somebody else got a hold of it and it was like it's your personal  shit they put your name into a corporation they go three months without paying it then they put a 
[02:18:00]  little teeny ad in like bethlen pennsylvania it says you are going to have a sale or you know acme  llc woodside 944 is having a sale because that way your name's not on it so nobody comes no one  knows what's what they're selling only one person uh a sale i understand i understand wow and they  take it all back that's sleazy man who has that it was in anaheim california who has the lead belly  guitar you mean the nixon now it wasn't didn't kirk get a lead belly guitar he did have one i don't 
[02:18:30]  know where it is ernie may have it um the last guitar i played uh on unplugged francis wants so  she wants to keep that who has that that's an art pack i have that oh you have that  francis and me have that so you and francis are okay now you guys are yeah no we're good terms we  talk we haven't seen each other in three years wow we just missed each other at coachella because  we went on different days and we talk a lot yeah so you get back together a little bit yeah that's 
[02:19:00]  you guys had some rough roads good good for you okay you're not going to pull an oj and try to get  your shit back are you got all this stuff stolen and he found out some people had and went in with  guns and he's been in jail that's why he's in jail now yeah yeah four years already five years  fodder for fantasies i don't think i could kill anybody i could probably knee someone if i was mad  and you could hurt someone just not uh yeah there's a bang in the knee but i have to be really 
[02:19:30]  mad you never beat up somebody before yeah i have three assault charges damn but no convictions  all right girls are guys yeah no i can go to japan that's a good one i'm cool for japan  that's a good uh who lives in the old house what old house in seattle yeah this uh microsoft lady  who doesn't win the little kids that come next door for their pilgrimage just oh really yeah  yeah yeah it's a really waspy neighborhood too that's why howard schultz starbucks guy  had a uh he pulled a 1901 easement on me so i couldn't build a driveway because the city of 
[02:20:00]  seattle picked on him and then he charged the city of seattle with anti-semitism hired rogers and  cowen wow and we our kids his kid was the same as his franny and he wouldn't let her play with him  snotty and he had built his driveway like seriously two inches onto this thing veretta park  but it's so waspy and it really is an anti-semitic town really if you don't like jews you don't like  show people that's a rule so i remember going into this meeting it's all these wasps and it was the 
[02:20:30]  friends of veretta park and if you look at pictures of that thing i mean every day they have to take the  you know every whatever month they have to take the bench down because people write shit on the bench  because his ashes aren't anywhere because no graveyard in washington that's in the willamette  valley will take his ashes why that doesn't sound right suicide is a felony in washington it's  actually in some states it's considered mental illness right but in washington state for insurance 
[02:21:00]  reasons because lobbies tend to make a lot of laws right um suicide is a very it's very high  it's very high by men with guns and so the insurance lobbies made it into a felony so you can't so  there's no life insurance no life insurance you got it that's it so where are the ashes it took me by  the way um i have a lot of them oh you split them up a little bit i split them up with his mom yeah  and and so she has them in this tibetan stupa and then there's some under a willow tree 
[02:21:30]  that we don't know what to do with the bloody willow tree though because she's moving out of  that house oh sure so i don't want to give it to paul allen and so we straighten this little mess out  so how to dig up the willow tree and bring it put where how do you central park do that it's hard to  carry a willow tree yeah back of a willow trees are really delicate i'll take it no you have to have  an arboretum guy be very very delicate i understand but if you're going to leave it there i'll 
[02:22:00]  leave it there all right we'll take it it's got a beautiful house you want the willow tree  i don't think i can do the willow tree i think you're right but i don't know i don't want to  do that yoko strawberry fields yeah yeah right right it's not really me yeah strawberry fields is  kind of protect you want it to be somewhere public that can be watched because somebody will take it  yeah that's why i thought of paul allen because he sort of owns excuse me i burped a lot on howard too 
[02:22:30]  oh fuck you you went at the harbor um so every time i burp i'm gonna pretend i'm a sailor from pearl  harbor um but um um what's i saying oh i don't know now i i want to make sure that this whole experience  music project which is that museum thing is clean and that my stuff isn't there right so in order to do  that there needs to be dialogue and there's dialogue between lawyers and as shakespeare said  first thing we do let's kill all the lawyers one other question because i think you got to go yeah 
[02:23:00]  where are you at with dave kroll these days i don't know you know i talked to pat smear yeah um a little  while ago and um about two weeks ago um pat was the only person in in la that could not drive and he was  also really happy and when kurt wanted somebody in his band that was happy he wasn't that great  a guitar player but he was happy so i know he's got it's really really happy and he was working for  minimum weights at the ssc superstore with my first husband falling james and falling james said to him 
[02:23:30]  if you join that band you're selling out wow no kidding yeah this guy was a tranny that i married in  in las vegas it's an annulment whole backstory thing it's in my wiki who knew we had so much in  common we all do it right of course courtney jim is in the tranny so that's really i married a tranny  in las vegas oh wow no i came back to the club lingerie peppers were there l7 was there um gun club 
[02:24:00]  guys were there i said i just married fall and james and no one laughed now these people aren't laughing  uh-oh i did something bad oh man and then i didn't have a money for a lawyer for like a year  so it took me a year to get an old he was really into pantyhose yeah of course so when  kurt called pat at the ssc superstore following james is there he's like if you join nirvana you're  selling out so pat to this day is in the food fighters and he said you know every time this  shit comes up dave says i have nothing to do with it he goes you know have you ever thought that it 
[02:24:30]  could just be the lawyers and that actually is food for thought but when i went on howard and i  said many years ago i said i'll have lunch with him he went on howard and he was like you know basically  her so it's not a yoko thing about us what it is is it's not even a dislike thing on my end it's that  first of all i had absolutely no awareness of how big they were until a few months ago when i bought my 
[02:25:00]  guitar player telecaster looked up a guitar center and saw what i thought was the super bowl it was  a food fighter show holy they're big you had no idea they're huge arenas you all know them yeah  big arenas but how did it take you so long to know the point the point is is that there's a financial  issue with like money market accounts pension plans under something called nirvana inc that doesn't  include francis and i need to get to the bottom of what that is and maybe it's just lawyers because 
[02:25:30]  lawyers are hacks awful people in rock and roll so you know but i'm so sick of lawyers i just want  to play rock yeah they're telling us you have to leave um but it's courtney c-o-u-r-t-n-e-y  on twitter and uh she's got a bunch of solo dates starting uh you can just go to ticketmaster.com  uh starting with june 20th in philly and she's hitting boston maryland uh here in brooklyn  port chester new york asbury park and in huntington there's a whole bunch of gigs  i've heard the stand penny yeah spring scene five hours it's a great outdoor stage you're going to 
[02:26:00]  be playing yeah it's awesome right i mean these are small shows yeah cool the tv show hey courtney  real quick you think nirvana would still be together today if kurt was alive no of course not he would  have went off and did his own thing together he might be married to a model and living on the upper  west side and you know have twins and we might be in twitter wars  was he ready to leave nirvana that room was out there you gotta talk to azarad and charlie cross 
[02:26:30]  and that unplugged album showed his his talent i mean we all knew how talented he was but that  unplugged album in his voice holy i know i was listening to um all apologies howard was playing  it howard doesn't play nirvana a lot i think he was doing because i was there right it's like i wasn't  in nirvana it was in a hole ah yeah so i'm gonna go on lithium after this and it's a 90s station and  all i'm gonna play is chicks that's cool yeah because all they play somebody told me they still  play bush all day it's like i don't know can you believe it bush and like and like soundgarden and

[02:37:30]  Having a couple of belts  Of course  And she's the girl  That comes in  And she's like  And you're like  And then all of a sudden  She'll come over to you  Hey, you're hot  And she'll grab your dick  Oh man, you got a big dick  I'll be like  Oh  Yeah  And all of a sudden  Yeah  I realize she said  You are a big dick  Yeah, exactly  And then she's like  Hey, where are you going after this  I'm going back to my place  I'll go  I got nothing to do  Alright  And that's how it happens  That's the one  Well you know what  I'm in the jacuzzi  With fucking Courtney Love  Absolutely  Yeah, that'd be crazy  And she's like  Wow, dinosaurs  I'm a little creeped up 
[02:38:00]  Dinosaurs  I only have one dinosaur  Fucking Michael Jackson  You're turning into  You got  My son is in the dinosaurs  He's not even three  He's not even three  And he's almost out of that phase  Now, I just bought him one yesterday  He's like  Ah, he just blew it all  I got it  You're right  They go  They're out of that phase  And he's in a six foot tall  Velociraptor by my jacuzzi  I gotta say  It's pretty impressive  Have you seen the picture?  No  It's pretty impressive  Why don't  You don't think it's cool?  I don't know  It's not cool  Anthony, what's wrong?  I never said it's cool 
[02:38:30]  What's wrong with you?  We almost had the willow tree  You didn't help negotiate  I didn't want Courtney's  We could have fucking had the willow tree  With Kurt's ashes  What are you going to do with that?  It's a conversation piece  The willow tree  Yeah, but it has his ashes  Can't move it  The roots go a million miles  They do  Yeah  There  You gotta admit  That's kind of cool, Florentine  Oh, there it is  You don't think that's cute?  Look  Also, that's when  Everything's growing in  It's a lot of bushy 
[02:39:00]  Around there now  So it's a lot more  Like camouflaged  Not out front  It's just like  It looks great at night  You're gonna get the eyes  To light up  At night  I always liked dinosaurs  As a kid  Now I could buy a life-size one  You got the eyes  To light up yet?

[02:39:30]  Do you ever talk to it?  Like if you're in a jacuzzi  By yourself  No, that would really be bad  If I was like  Talking to this fucking dinosaur  Yeah, you probably read  The Drudge Report  And you look up at the dinosaur  And go  You know, you're lucky  They weren't around  When you were  Drudge Report  I'd have another website  Oh yeah  Can we play  Butt Trumpet  You're Ugly  Oh  I can't believe  Courtney Love  Didn't know this song  From the 90s  I don't know that one either  Yeah, you know it  It's pretty obscure  From the 90s  Oh, that one  Butt Trumpet I know  No, you don't  I do so  No, you don't 
[02:40:00]  That's the band  That lived through this album  That first whole record  That she's doing  Phenomenal  Yeah  It's basically like  Everyone said it was  A Nirvana record  Well, some people think  He might have got into  She might have got into  Kurt's Notes  It's a great record  Might have found  A notebook or two  Before  He might have helped out  He's like  I need a riff here  It is an amazing record  Nirvana Nuggets maybe  Maybe a couple things  Should have called the album  Nirvana Nuggets  Maybe a couple things  In there  I don't know  We should have asked her 
[02:40:30]  She probably would have been honest  It was great when she said  There's a million questions  We want to ask her  Saw her wearing those long johns  Hey, you're wearing an artifact  And she goes  No, I'm wearing my dead husband's clothes  Yeah  You forget because he's  Kurt Cobain's such an iconic guy  But like, oh yeah  That was just his wife  Right  Yeah, yeah  Wearing his clothes  Fucked up  Let's listen to this for a second  I can give you 30 seconds of it  That's all I can do for you  Why?  It's nowhere  Sammy!  Alright, give us the 30  But the whole thing is how it starts off slow  We don't have it in the system  She starts screaming  Yes, you don't  As long as nowhere  Well, they changed their name 
[02:41:00]  I found out  Hold on a minute  To what?  Right there  That's the 30 second preview of it  No, I don't want to play that  Play twice  Hold on a minute  They're now called  Thank you  Zona Rube  Or whatever  Betty Blowtorch  Is their name now  Betty Blowtorch  Betty Blowtorch  Yeah  And I haven't heard of them either  Betty Blowtorch I've heard of  Oh yeah  They better  Okay, we got that  What?  We got that as Betty Blowtorch  Betty Blowtorch 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, but I'd rather play it off my phone  Oh, dude  Doesn't make any sense  Alright, play from there  So now it's Betty Blowtorch  Something happened where they re-recorded it  Or something  Maybe someone sued him for the name  Yeah, yeah  That's it  Yeah, it starts off slow  Yeah  Geez, right  It's 90 intros 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  I was walking home from school one day  When I saw Danny  Standing there  I tried to show him  My dirty underwear  He showed me his  But nothing could compare  Then he said  You're ugly  What the hell they put to you  You're ugly  And I bet your mommy is too  This is so 90s 
[02:42:30]  Oh my God  Talk about bullying  Jesus  Oh, this is bullying  Right  It's really good  Never heard this  Really?  Well, we played it on the only station  That really liked  Yeah  107.3  No?  I don't like it  No, I mean it's  This is the 90s equivalent  Of bad, like, 80s bands  In the 80s  Like there were the good 80s bands  And then the real shit  Yeah  That would just  This is that 
[02:43:00]  She's a chick  And she's like  Yeah  She's got some angst  Yeah  She's got 90s angst  So I looked in the mirror  To see if it was true  And my reflection looked at me  Like it was scared to  And inside  You're ugly  Is she an ugly bitch?  The one singing this?  I don't know  Wow, you think there might even be some irony involved?  I don't know  She's not ugly?  Wow  Ah, she's alright 
[02:43:30]  Ah, no, she's ugly  Yeah, she's not a pretty gal  The whole band is like  Dykes  The bruisers  They look dykey  They look dykey  Yeah  The Lizzy's  You think they les out after shows?  Les out  There's four of them  So they can get two scissors going  Think they bump donuts?  By the way, lesbians never scissor  No?  No  That's the dumbest  They just bump the donuts, right?  They don't scissor 
[02:44:00]  Oh, oh, oh  Bob Levy's on the line  What?  Bob, are you allowed to even call our show?  I'm scared  I don't know  It's halfway  I don't know  I talked to Howard Stern  He said you guys were good guys  Oh, good  Yeah, but I want to talk  Now, Anthony  You would definitely bang her on the road  There's no doubt about it  Because we've all been on the road  I've been on the road with Florentine  And he is probably one of the creepiest motherfuckers  I've ever been on the road  Wow, what a compliment 
[02:44:30]  That's nice  That is a compliment  Absolutely  Right  Loosen to the greatness he would do  Every time we got to a hotel  We would start moving out tables and chairs  And so the women couldn't sit there  They'd have to sit on the bedroom  You would set up the room ahead of time?  Oh, yeah, yeah  We'd take all the furniture out of the room  Because you get a girl back  They'd go all the way in the corner  And sit in that little chair  Right  So where'd you put the furniture?  We'd throw it in the emcee's room  Whoever was opening  Like you'd chuck everything in there 
[02:45:00]  That is brilliant  So you bring them back  They've got to go right to the bed  That eliminates that step  Brilliant  From them sitting in the chair like  Hi  It's a time saver  Huh?  And what we'd do is  It was a half hour that was out of the game  We didn't have time for them to sober up  We always had liquor  The bathtub was full  We smelled like dog shit after the first time  But we didn't give a shit  And fucking  We would bring furniture in the hallway  And people would go  Like  Are you going to do that to our room?  We're like  No, we don't work here  Yeah, we'd have couches 
[02:45:30]  There was couches lined up in the hallway  We'd be taken out  Like movers  Get this one out of here too  And if the emcee  We didn't have an emcee  We'd just leave it in the hallway  Because ships would always go to that couch  Or that chair  And you can't get them to the bed  It's a creepy move  So you're getting rid of two hours easy  Right  So they sit right on the bed  That's brilliant, Jim  Wow  What Jim would do was  Like he'd like  I'd have one like  With my arm around her  And Jim would tell a horrible joke  And I would laugh out of control 
[02:46:00]  And I would choke her backwards  Onto the bed  What a move  We lied to women out in Canada  We told them we were in bands from England  We would do shitty English accents  And that shit  And I'm telling them  I'm in a bad  I'm just playing here  A couple weeks  And then we're going back  We're fucking pulling out strippers  Out of the club  Jim would call up and go  What time does the last girls go on 
[02:46:30]  11 o'clock  Well, stick ready  We've got to be there at 10 too  Because we've got to get them fresh  When they're off the stage  We're fresh meat  Next thing you know  We're dragging out  Two at a fucking time  It was unbelievable  Wow, yeah  Well, Levy's move  With girls after a show  Was he would give them  His hotel room key  Uh-huh  And go  Hey, come back to my room  At 324  I've got to make a phone call  I've got to call my son  Or something like that  He'd make up something  Because he didn't want to go  To the other bar with them  The local bar  Where they always wanted  To go party  Because you don't want to go  To you're going to get in a fight 
[02:47:00]  Yeah  Because all those guys  In that bar  Have been trying to fuck her  Since high school  And all of a sudden  The comedian  Uh-huh  Comes in and she comes in  Trying to show him off  That's it's trouble  So Levy go  Look, I've got to go back  Call my son  He's been sick or whatever  So why don't you go back  To my room later  I'm in 324  Here's my room key  He would get like  Five room keys  When we'd check in  How many do you need  I need five  Five  Yeah, I lose a lot of them  And he would just hand them  Out to chicks  Here, 324  Marlee's like  I'm not doing the work  If they show up  They show up  If not  So Levy's like  I waited to jerk off  To like 3 in the morning  When I knew  They weren't going to show up 
[02:47:30]  That was your out time  3 o'clock  You gotta have a time set  One time I went down  To get another key  Because I actually  Did lose it  And they go  Sir, we don't have any more  Yeah, we don't have any more  Wow  That's great  It was a good move  And at like a 1.30 or so  A girl would show up  And he's like  I didn't have to  Yeah, I didn't have to go  Buy her more drinks  None of that stuff  Yeah, why fucking  Just bank on one  And the best thing was  One show we did in Baltimore  I get off stage  I'm making out 
[02:48:00]  With this hot blonde  Within 3 seconds  Remember that?  He didn't  He just walked off the stage  In 2 feet  He starts making out  With us  In front of the whole crowd  Jesus  So she goes  Look, I gotta go out  With my friends  We're having a bachelorette party  So meet me at my hotel room  I'm in 324  In like an hour  So I drive to Levy  It's like 20 minutes away  I drive  And I drop him off  He goes  Alright, I'll see you in the morning  The chick was really hot  He gets there  And I pulled away  I'm like  Alright, he's good  I pull away  He knocks on the door  This is like trying to be  Before a phone  We phone like cell phones  Basically 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, so he has no idea  So he knocks on the door  A guy answers the door  In the hotel room  He's like  Who are you?  And the guy's like  Who are you?  He's like  Who are you?  Who are you?  He's like  Is Amanda here?  He's like  Yeah, she's sleeping  He goes  Well, who are you?  He goes  I just met her a little while ago  She brought another guy back  Oh, man  So Levy shows up  And the guy's like  He goes  Well, I'm not leaving  And Levy's like  Well, I'm not leaving  So the guy's like  I don't know what this  I couldn't get a ride  He couldn't get a ride  I dropped him off  So I didn't have a  It wasn't before cell phones  So Levy's like  Fuck it 
[02:49:00]  I'm not leaving  So he goes in the chair  In the corner room  And just sits there  As that guy goes back  In bed with her  And then he's like  Fuck this  I'm not doing it  So then he crawled in bed  And he slept with the couple  I swear to God  And they woke up in the morning  The girl's like  Levy's still sleeping  She's like  Who is that guy?  And the guy's like  I don't know  He said he knows you  She goes  I never saw him before  And Levy wakes up  I was the comedian last night  What a fucking creep  To go into bed with a couple  That is pretty fucking creepy, dude  Like he's yelling 
[02:49:30]  It's not my fault  She's a fucking filthy whore  I mean, one time  Jim's in Canada  This girl comes up to him  She uses a guy's name  That was probably  The stupidest, weirdest name  I don't know if you remember it, Jim  But she goes  It was Curtis  Curtis, that's it  Curtis  And Jim goes  Uh, yeah  And tell him that story  What you did  We're going to somebody's wedding 
[02:50:00]  We're on their way to the wedding  She thought I was this guy  Curtis from some band  In, like, Canada  I think I told the story  That's fine  Tell it again, though  That's great  Yeah, so she thought  I was Curtis  She's like  Are you Curtis?  I'm like, yeah  And she's like  You remember me?  I'm like, uh  I think so  Your hair's a little different  That's what you always say to chicks  Because their hair  Even the day before  It's different  You're a hair's a little bit  Oh, yeah, yeah  It is  I just got a  Yeah, you noticed  Yeah, yeah  Sheesh, yeah, sheesh  I noticed  You got the blood stain out of you 
[02:50:30]  You are  You're a magic maker  God damn blood stain  It is great  So, long story short  Next thing I know  I'm, like, making out with her  And she's like  And she says to Levy  Can you believe what he did to me?  Can I tell him?  I go, yeah  I don't know what I did to her  Oh, shit  She's like, I met him  He was in a band  I met him one night  We went back to his apartment  We had sex  And it was a blizzard  It was up in Canada  She goes, and then he told me  I had to leave  And he made me walk home  In a blizzard  Like three miles  And you never called me again  I'm like, I'm sorry 
[02:51:00]  It sounds like something  I would do  It is definitely something  You would do  Curtis  Curtis is just as big  A scumbag  I know  I thought I was working  With Curtis  The real Curtis  It's so easy  I'm telling you  You should go out of town  And just go into a bar  And tell them  You're a doctor  You're anything  You know what I mean?  Why waste time?  You know what I mean?  I wanted to get laid on stage  So bad one night  Right?  A while back 
[02:51:30]  And I go  How do you want me to bring me up?  I go  Say I'm going to be  Joey's cousin  Joey's brother  On Friends next year  They bring me up like  On that  I got fucking  Ten women all over me  I pick one  And get out of there  It is so simple  It's so money  Hung to be fucking whores  It's the greatest  Fucking thing  Holy shit  Just to think of this shit  Is brilliant  Huh?  Norton would get upset  When he goes 
[02:52:00]  I gotta come  You know  We gotta get laid  And that shit  And fucking  He comes on the gig  He's fucking  Kicking and screaming  Because just nothing  Happened that night  And Jim actually  Got a girl  And that's the night  That you came up  With a great idea  To jerk off on a TV  That'll teach Jim  When he comes home  To watch Sports Center  So they both  Jerked off on the TV  And Jim walks in  And looks at him  And goes  Nice  And just goes to bed  Yeah  Yeah  Cause we were all  Sharing a room  There was two beds  And two double beds  And I went up 
[02:52:30]  Going out with this girl  And they stayed there  So they  To get even at me  They say  We're gonna jerk off  On the TV screen  In the hotel  And I come back  And I go  What is that on the screen  And I go  We jerked off  And I'm like  Nice  And I just went to bed  Like it's gonna bother me  Even if it was my own TV  It wouldn't bother me  I think it bothered me  More watching Norton do it  Than when you've seen it  Jerking off on the TV  Who comes up with that  Holy fuck 
[02:53:00]  It happens  That's what makes  Our life so great  When we were on the road  We were called  The load warriors  Who called you  The load warriors  Bob made that up  I don't think  People walk around  Going uh oh  Here's the load warriors  One time  One time  Bob  One time  We're doing this gig  Like in upstate New York  And this girl  Was talking to Bob  After the show  And he was sure  She was gonna come back  To the hotel room  And I knew she was  And I could see the vibe  It wasn't happening 
[02:53:30]  He's like no  She's definitely coming back  And I was in the room  Next to him  And he's like  I'm telling you  She's gonna come back  I go Bob she's not  So I was like  You know what  I have to do this  I went to the friggin phone book  I called the friggin escort service up  And I ordered a hooker  To leave his room  So like 45 minutes later  I hear  I'm almost out sleeping  I hear this screaming  In the hallway  Who are you  I'm not fucking paying  It's like yes you are  You maybe  I drove 45 minutes  Somebody's paying  I didn't order yet  And screaming going on  And I'm in my bed  Friggin giggling  You didn't have to leave

[02:54:30]  Going on there  Being creepy fuck  And picking up women  Was such an easy thing  People make it seem  Like it's so fucking hard  All you gotta do  Is bullshit them  And it was so simple  Sounded like you were  Trading quality in though  For a little bit  Of quantity  But you know  It's the road  Yeah  Fucking hot chicks man  I'm telling you  Really fucking  We were pulling strippers  Out of Canada  We went to a strip club  I don't know how  We found the hotel  Next to it  There was only  Seven people

Lean to the side  Yeah as you're driving  I'm telling you  This could be a great tip  Cause I really have had a problem  With this over the years  You lean almost to like  To pass in your seat  Right in the middle  Like that  Okay okay  Like that as you're driving  Alright I'm gonna try that  And keep it straight 
[03:12:30]  As you're driving  Yeah you don't bend your mule  It's crazy  No usually you're like  You know you have to go so bad  In your traffic  So now you're like  Alright fuck it  This has to be accomplished  And then dump it out  At the traffic light  If there's no one behind you  I'm gonna throw it at a car  That's pissing you off  No you wanna save the bottle though  For the car just in case  You get a new bottle don't you  One time I had a piss bottle  Under the seat I forgot  It was like half full  Oh no  And it was clear  And I was on a date  And I had to stop short  And it went right under her feet  It rolled right under her feet  In a passenger seat

[03:14:30]  I get frustrated  That's why we're trying  To keep ours to an hour  Maybe a little more  Here and there  But not too much more  Yeah  Some people look at it  And go  Forget an hour  That's what I do  When I'm picking  Who I haven't listened to  In a while  I go  Oh two hours  Okay  No for him  And then if I see  Something a little under an hour  I'm like  Nice  So  And you're gonna join  Friends of the show  I don't know why  You weren't part of the road  Yeah that'd be great  Absolutely  You slipped through the cracks  And I apologize  But we'll get you up there  Ozzy's Boneyard

[03:16:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  Is pretty much over  This show will be available  Later today  With Sirius XM  On Demand  After ONA Live  Is next  Sirius XM  Hey hey hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is  After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Yeah  After Opie and Anthony live  Opie and Jim Florentine 
[03:17:00]  Talking business  I didn't turn  Now your mics are off  What?  I didn't even  Nobody heard anything  What you said about  Your secret  You know  Business talks before  I'm asking them  How I joined  The Load Warriors  Is that it?  If I have to pledge  Do I have to pledge  To be a Load Warrior?  No but what you have to do  Is you have to  We have to have a match  And you have to win the belts  Of course  Right now me and Levy  Are champs  We're the Load Warriors  Yeah  You got another partner  We have a tag team match  You guys are like a dynasty  We are  We've held the belts  We lost a couple times  A couple times  But he got it back 
[03:17:30]  We got it back  So we've been holding  For a while  So if someone's gonna come  We're like Bruno San Martino  San Martino had the belt  For a long time  Right right right right  You know  And then he eventually lost  They phased him out  Was he the  The most out of shape  Champion of all time?  No San Martino  Wasn't that bad  He had that  Old man  Like  Yeah he looked like  An old movie star  He looked like  Chuck Heston  Yeah  He put his trunks  Up really high  He had like a big chest  But he definitely  Had a belly  But yeah  He was older  Even at the time  When he was a champ  Who was the  Well Mick Foley 
[03:18:00]  I guess would be  Mick Foley was probably  Out of shape champion  Yeah I mean like  You know  Yoko Zuna had the belt  And stuff like that  But that's like  Ridiculously fat  I would say the most  Out of shape  Was probably  Yeah the schlubbiest  Champion had to be  Mick Foley  Mick Foley  Yeah I mean  Cause then it was  Bruno San Martino  And then it was  Bob Backlund  And he was kinda  And then it was  Hogan after that  And then it was  Billy Graham had the belt  For a little while  Was he the first  In shape champion  Superstar Billy Graham  Well Billy Graham  Superstar  But he was  He was taking Roy 
[03:18:30]  Yeah he was the first  Of the Roy  I know enough  About wrestling  I know that much  Yeah Bob Backlund  Was in pretty good shape  He wasn't a Roy guy  But he was pretty  So was he the first  In shape champion  Probably  I would say probably  Besides superstar  Billy Graham  Yeah  Cause yeah  Billy Graham beat  Bruno San Martino  And then Bob Backlund  Beat him  Did Ivan Putzky  Ever have the title  I don't think he was  Ever world champion  No Ivan Koloff  Had it for like  Nine days  They always needed  Those bad guys  To have the title  Just for a second  And then the next  Good guy could win  But they couldn't 
[03:19:00]  Let him have it  A little longer  Than a week  No  Oh Jesus  They were worried  About tickets  Yeah they were  About tickets  Ivan Koloff  Holding that belt  He was hated  They wouldn't go  Just to boo him  Like they'd boo him  If he was on the card  But as a champ  They wouldn't  Plus everybody  Thought it was real  So they didn't want  To see  Like now  When the bad guy wins  Everybody knows  It's phony  So it's like  You could just  Yeah the good guy  Is eventually going to win  This is fun  It's entertainment  Right  Back then you wanted  To see the Italian guy  Beat the shit out of everybody  I got a Sudoku puzzle  In today  Oh good for you  I did a lot of talking 
[03:19:30]  On the show today  So I don't know  How I accomplished that  Look at that  But you did  I was definitely  Multitasking  You successfully  Accomplished Sudoku  Well we should have  Courtney Love sign it  Well you say we for  It's your show  You should have  Headquartered  I can't move  From my seat  You played Sudoku  And did the show today  And I snuck in  A candy crush  What level are you on?  Dude you Instagrammed your level  That was embarrassing  I did a whole after show  About being stuck at level 29  Well I'm stuck at level  This  I'm about to give up 
[03:20:00]  On this level too  I'm not buying the paintbrush  Candy crush  I don't play anything  It's a girls game  No I don't  I don't  I don't have time for that  You gotta match the candies  I can barely update my Twitter  And stupid Facebook  You gotta match all the candies  And then when you get  Three candies  That are the same  They disappear  I'm not four  I'm not four years old  This is the sound  Of addiction right here  And then when you get  Like five  All in one shot  It goes  Sweet  Sweet  Sweet  That's not you  No 
[03:20:30]  I don't have time for that  I'm on level  134  And stuck  I think I'm up to  About two weeks  On the same level  Yeah I got to level 30  Last night  See  Any Instagrams  That's an accomplishment  Even saying  Level 134  Is not an accomplishment  People are well  Into the 200s now  Yeah but I talk to  The common people  They're still stuck  I am stuck  I write with the music  It's driving me nuts  I play with the music off  That's a little bit more manly  Right Florentine  Oh cause  Oh or the game 
[03:21:00]  Yeah  Like to play with that  Not  Like on silence  Yeah  Don't put it right up  To that mic  I have to turn your mic down  But you're talking into it  I love this little song  Alright  Yeah that's better  We're working  Okay okay  Sweet  You see  Like I play with the sound off  Alright let's do this  And lots of times  My wife thinks  That I'm doing something else  Maybe I'm working  Maybe I'm doing something  Right  And then she looks over  Oh it's Candy Crush  Come on  See that's gonna affect your marriage  You think so  Well especially  Yeah it's better that you leave it off 
[03:21:30]  But then she's gonna say  You got time to do all that  Play that nonsense  There's no reason for it  Yeah  It's like why don't you  Why don't you take the dishes  Out of the dishwasher  The dishes  How come we don't do anything  You don't want to watch TV with me  Right  How come you don't want to go out  With my friends  But you have time to play that  Right  It's a whole thing  That's true  It's a whole  Believe me  She's storing them up there  To use them  When you don't want to do something  Or something didn't get done  So I'm not gonna have that out  I gotta make sure I'm saying yes to everything  Cause the minute I say no  Oh you have time for Candy Crush  No you can 
[03:22:00]  But just you know  Don't let her know you're doing it  Hide it like you're looking at you porn  Right  You know do it  The bomb went off  I don't know what that is  I'm not up there yet  You're not up to the bombs  No  They'll drive you insane  They're awful  I had nine moves to get it done  To make that candy disappear  It didn't happen  See I don't play games very much  But it's one of those things  Like I just downloaded it  Cause everybody else was playing it  And once you start it  Then you're in  Like if you started it  You'd be in  That's why you're doing  You're doing good  To stick to your principles  And say that's not what I do 
[03:22:30]  You know  I'm surprised the Lode Warriors  Don't play Candy Crush  No  We don't have time  We don't have time  We're moving furniture  Out of hotel rooms  So I have to sit on the bed  I don't have time to play games  But during down time  There was no down time  We're always plotting  Not being bothered by jizz  On the television  Yeah exactly  That's a classic story  Alright Sam Roberts  We're gonna walk out of here  Alright guys  And we're gonna talk about our kids  A little bit  Like we usually do  Yeah  Excellent show  How old does your kid have to be 
[03:23:00]  Before he gets Lode Warriors stories  You know early  I'm gonna tell him  Yeah  Yeah I curse in front of my kid already  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah it's probably early  I'm gonna  Do you curse in front of your kid  I try not to  I try not to  But if it happens  We're not like panicking about it  If your kid starts doing like  You know your kid's a teenager  Like late teens  Like 16, 17, 18  And starts doing like  Scumbag moves that you used to do  Is that gonna be a proud moment  Or are you gonna say  I don't want you going down this road  No I'll just say look man  These are  Yeah do it  But you know  You gotta do it 
[03:23:30]  There's gonna be some consequences  But you know  Yeah exactly  But I'm gonna always tell them  To wear a bag  Yeah you just gotta be honest  You know that's the key  Wear a bag  You know what I mean  Always  I'll even come  If you picked up some girl  I'll come in the middle of the night  You can't drive  And drop you know  Some bags off  Cause I always tell them  You shouldn't  You shouldn't drive  After dumping a load  Well yeah that too  We might just want to sleep  So call me in the middle of the night  Yeah  I'll pick you up  Right  After you dumped a load  Cause I don't want you driving  After dumping a load  Yeah  Cause I know  He's probably not gonna last long  I've already figured this out 
[03:24:00]  In bed  Cause I don't either  Yeah so I'm sure he got it  From  And my wife's father  Even kind of mentioned it one time  Oh really  He's quick too  Cause we hang out all the time  Yeah so it's  He's not gonna last long  Either  So I'm gonna tell him  You already know that  Yeah yeah  So I'm gonna tell him  Look you wear a bag  Because you're gonna last longer  And all the girls  Are gonna talk about you  That Florentine kid  Fucked me for like an hour  Because he's the one guy  Wearing a bag  Yeah so he's gonna be  Laid just on referrals  Right  You know what I mean 
[03:24:30]  All the chicks in high school  They all gonna talk  He put it in two seconds  He came all over me  Really Florentine  He fucks for an hour  Right  And then they all talk  And then eventually  The next party  And they're all of the age  Where they don't know  That wearing a bag  Or not wearing a bag  Makes a difference  Yeah I have no idea  So they won't even bring it up  So that's why  I gotta teach him young  Wear a bag  So you can put some numbers up  Yeah  Does your son have a big bag  Yeah it's pretty  It's pretty big  It was huge in the beginning  It shrunk a little  But it's still  It's still nice  My son's gonna have  He's gonna have a hammer  He has a big piece 
[03:25:00]  He's gonna have a hammer  Yeah  I do alright  And you know  The in-laws  Holy fuck  They all got hammers  Really  So your son's probably  Gonna have a bigger one  Than you  Yeah  The odds are good  He's gonna be tall  With a big hammer  He almost has me beat now  He does  Yeah  He's doing well  Yeah  He got his first erection  Like six months ago  And we were changing  I mean my wife  And I wanted to take a picture  I'm like get the camera  I wanted to put the thumbs up  Right next to it  She's like you'll get arrested  You know  I'm like  But this is a proud moment  That's the shit  We should have learned 
[03:25:30]  In fucking high school  By the way  What  I didn't know kids  Get fucking boners  I was just about to say  I had no idea  That at whatever  Two three years old  That you  Yeah  They got it  Yeah  Wait wait  What  Even earlier than that  But yeah  Yeah  I mean he was getting them  At like nine months  Really  Yeah he's had boners  For a long time now  It's the strangest thing  I figured like six or seven  Is when they start  Just randomly popping up  No it's earlier  That's what I thought  No  Long time ago  But I really wanted  To get a shot of it  That would have been a good one  To put in a scrapbook  You could get arrested for that  Yeah and then you  Because you're going to end up 
[03:26:00]  I know but it's a  Why but it's my son  It's not a sport  But you'll keep it on your phone  You'll show it to your friends  But if I had the thumbs up  There's nothing sexual  If I have the thumbs up  Next to it  Like I'm proud of my son  Explain that to the judge  Yeah  That can only go horribly wrong  I understand it's an innocent thing  Like if I was licking my lips  As taking the picture  Then I'd say  Alright you know what  I gotta go to jail  For a couple years  But a thumbs up  Is like alright  Stay away from taking the pictures  Yeah I know  Yeah you don't want to hurt you  It's in my memory  I gotta hear  It's gonna fuck up  The legacy of the load warriors  That's what you do  Yeah  Just keep it right in your memory 
[03:26:30]  Keep it right in your memory  It's always with you  You know  Because I want to be on that porch  When I'm like 80  Go son I remember your first rod  Right  Take a seat  And write a little journal entry  About it  We just took care of your after show  Why  Everyone should call up  And just talk about baby boners  See you got three calls already  Yeah but I don't know  If I want to do that  I'm sorry  You know you have to  Look who's on the wall  Opie and Anthony  I guess so  But you guys leave  And this isn't really  Well it's your show sort of  Well you made it into your show  Yeah  Even though when you told me  You wanted to do this  The concept was drastically different 
[03:27:00]  Than what you turned it into  It's better now  But with that said  I think you should do  Nothing but phone calls  Till 11 about baby boners  I don't think I'm going  I'll tell you that I will  But you guys will leave  I'll just do my own thing  Or have people call in  About if their friends  Go out to pick up chicks  What would their wrestling tag team name be  Yeah  Instead of the load warriors  If there's something else  That's two phone topics we gave you  Do you think we could do  40 minutes on wrestling tag teams  That kind of sound like jizz  Yes  Maybe  Yes  The load warriors 
[03:27:30]  Beat that name  I'm sure you could do something  With the bushwhackers  The bushwhackers  Yeah  We had the bushwhackers in  One of them  Oh  What happened to the other one  I have no idea where he is  Probably back in New Zealand  Oh okay  He was strange that guy  He was weird  I'm going home  Alright  Sam was good seeing you  You too  Listen to Sam's podcast  It's very successful  Thank you  And Jim Florentine's podcast  And Jim Florentine's show  On the Boneyard tonight  How about people subscribe  To the Opie and Anthony podcast  I mean if you  Subscribe  You've got to subscribe

[03:32:30]  And everything  Immediately  To let the world know  Level 29  After whatever it had been  Two weeks  Was passed  Can I uh  Can I just say  How much I fucking hate you  For making me start that game dude  I told you specifically  And we can pull tape  Eric  You remember me saying this Eric  I told you so  I don't think I was here that day  Oh you mean  That was a perfect day for you  I wasn't here for the Candy Crush show  Perfect day for you  I told you not to download the game  Didn't I  Do I know what level I'm on  Did I tell you not to download the game  You told me  And I just wanted  Because I was curious  It was stupid of you  I told you you were going to be curious 
[03:33:00]  And I told you not to download the game  What level are you on  I'm on 50  How much time have you spent with this game  Well I do that fucking cheat  Where you like  You know you change the clock  Oh god  You're way in too deep  I told you  I'm not even doing that  I told you that was giving in  To the addiction  It absolutely did  Because I was like  I'll just give it a couple  You know  Tries whatever  The problem is  When you start changing it  To like the year  Like 2040  2039  You're running out of years  I'm running out of years  So I had to literally  Buy the lives again  Because the iPhone  Only lets you go so far  In terms of lives 
[03:33:30]  Right  And so now  And you have  You purchased lives  One time  Just to get me back  To like the year 2014  Because you couldn't wait  25 minutes  Fuck that  Fuck that  You should just bank  Lives sent to you by friends  I don't want anyone knowing  Any of my Facebook friends knowing  That's the idea  But they will  You're going to do it  Okay  And to make things worse  Sam  Keeps you from paying for everything  Yeah  We've been over all this  I can't do  I can't possibly do another  Candy Crush show  No no no  Just a quick little thing  No I'm glad to get the update  Just to make shit worse  Is that  If you 
[03:34:00]  If you change the date  Too much into the future  It turns off your iMessage  If you have an iPhone  So I start getting like  Text messages  I'm like what the  Like random text messages  Because you know  If you have iMessage off  Text messages come later  And all that sort of shit  So I'm missing  Complete conversations  Because of this dumb game  Yeah I'll get like  A text like today  From someone who's like  Hey Sal  What's going on dude  Like what the fuck is up  And it's something  They sent days ago  I'm telling you  I know dude  It's terrible  It's terrible  And I do the quest too 
[03:34:30]  To get to the next place  Because I don't want to be  It's Batman  Oh god this is horrible  It's terrible  Eric what level are you on  105  Oh my god  Pro  With this candy crush  Well there's a guy  Outside of our office  Who  Larry  Oh Larry  He's waiting for new episodes  New levels to be made  Because he's done  It's too much  Where's Troy  I need a real person  And that's all he does  Is brag about it  If Troy if you're listening  Come in here  I'd like to talk to you  Because Troy hasn't given in  To this god damn stupid  Cell phone game  It's fun though 
[03:35:00]  He's just going to hate  All of us  Kill some time  He should hate all of us  You're not doing this  Dumb shit are you  It's so stupid  It's so  Stupid  You're doing the right thing  I'm not into games  On the phone  I know  I like Tetris  That's about it  Yeah  And that's  Like I  It's a mistake  To even download  Because I'm not either  But then I download  The one that people  Are talking about  And all of a sudden  Now I'm wrenched in  It's stupid  It's so stupid  Like remember  When everybody was all  About angry birds  Yeah  I was like okay  Let me try this out  Because everybody was  Freaking out about it  And I tried 
[03:35:30]  I'm like this shit sucks  Yeah I have shit to do  Yeah  I shouldn't be doing this  Or like if you're going to be  Like say you're taking a dump  Like that's when you would  Probably play with your phone  Definitely  You should be  Trolling for bitches  On Instagram  Right  Right  Or like checking your tweets  Yeah  Now I'm all about Vine  Do you look straight at Vines  Yeah I'm looking through  Everybody's Vines  Interesting  You don't just wait  You don't just wait  Until the link pops up  On Twitter  No I'm looking through  On the app  So you actually follow  Vines on Vine  Yeah 
[03:36:00]  I mean that's what  You use it for  No I just go on Twitter  And just click the link  When somebody sends a Vine  On Twitter  I never look at  Actual Vine  The only time I open  The Vine app  Is to film a Vine  Well would you  Do that for Instagram  Like wouldn't you  Look at Instagram pictures  No you're right  I get it  I get it  You're right  You're using it properly  So why wouldn't you  Use it properly  I don't know  I guess I just  I don't care about  Other people's Vines as much  Ant's got a good Vine  Ant's got some  Next level shit for that  Gunning himself  That's funny  Ant has a great Vine  Although I do gotta say 
[03:36:30]  It is cheating  Of course it's cheating  I believe you're right  When you see people  That put together  A perfect Vine  Where they actually  Can do stuff seamlessly  Yeah  And do  I mean  Ant's Vine  And you can find it  On his Twitter  He did this thing  Where he edited  A six second movie  On his computer  Using software  Where he's having  A gun battle with himself  And it looks incredible  But it is  I mean the Vine  Is just him  Record  Vining  The movie he edited  On his computer  And he doesn't try to hide  That it's  No  He's got the keyboard 
[03:37:00]  And the shot  And everything  That's his deal  So I mean  And it works  It is cheating  But the fact that  He's open about it  Works I feel like  But yeah  Exactly  But you have to give  Props to people  That can pull off  A good Vine  More importantly  Than any of this  Because now the phones  Are full  And I'm sure  It's everybody  That either wants  To talk about  Infant erections  Or candy crush  Neither of which  I want to talk about  Anymore  I feel like both  Of those topics  Have gotten plenty  Of time today  Don't you  Yeah  I want to know  The update on you  Troy  Yeah  Your life  And your shits 
[03:37:30]  Because you were  On ONA  Last week  Yeah  And you were saying  That you'd had  Diarrhea every day  For like over a week  And ever since  You've been in Mexico  Yeah  And we were wondering  What kind  We figured it must be  A parasite  Something in your body  Yeah  An outside  Organism  Entered into your body  Yeah  And we were trying  To figure out  What it was  We haven't gotten  An update  We did get to hear  The Troy Shitting song  Yeah  But I want to know  What's going on 
[03:38:00]  In your body right now  It's still there  What?  Yeah  I was sure that  Since we hadn't heard  About it  It was over  Yeah no  It's still going on  Dude that's bad  I'm going to ride  The snake a little bit  What?  Is that like a gay?  No  I watched the Liberace movie  And I didn't hear them  Say ride the snake  So I don't know  All the lingo  But that sounds like  I'm riding it out  That sounds  What are you going to get  Like a little  Young boy or something?  No no no  I don't know  What ride the snake  Just like  I'm going to ride it out  Oh  The parasite  Yeah no  That's horrible  The parasite would just 
[03:38:30]  Grow and grow then  I'm sticking with it  For cosmetic reasons  You're  Like when girls  In college  Start  Because I know  When girls in college  Start eating  Diuretics  And  The stuff that makes you shit  What is it?  Like  Prints?  Whatever it is  Yeah  The general  Term for it though  The stuff that you're  Supposed to take  Only when you're constipated  Yeah  Girls will eat that  Like with meals  Yeah  And be like  Oh I'll shit more  And then I'll get skinny  Yeah  That's what you're doing  Yeah but I'm doing  The parasite  So that's kind of 
[03:39:00]  A little more badass  Well it's just kind of  Like it's there  Right  So you're saying  Well this is natural  Well I'm just kind of  Seeing where it goes  Because people tell me  That you can get rid of them  Just on your own  Your body will pass it  Yeah you can  But why would you try  You can also die of dehydration  No I'm staying well  I juice every morning  I know but you're  Diarrhea-ing every day  That's bad for your body  That dehydrates the body  But you don't understand  Like I finally  Like I'm losing  Like I had like a couple pounds  I just couldn't get rid of  And now they're just  It's just melting off  How many times 
[03:39:30]  Do you diarrhea a day?  So far today  It's been three  You've  You've number two'd  You've made  Three times today  Yeah  It's 1030 in the morning dude  Yeah it's not splattery though  It's like  It doesn't matter  The fact  I haven't even  I haven't sat on the toilet  Once today  Not once  Well  And you've been sitting  You've gone to sit  On the toilet three times  Yeah  And you don't  When you piss  You don't sit down to piss  Right?  You stand up  Oh yeah  So that's all shitting  Yeah  That's disgusting 
[03:40:00]  I mean  So what?  And it's bad for you  It says who?  Every doctor ever  Nah  What do you mean?  Nah  You're not gonna go to a doctor about it  I told you  I'm gonna ride it out  I'm gonna ride the snake  For how long?  Until you start  Like getting gaunched?  I just wanna see what happens  Although I did  I was at Memorial Day  And I was talking  Telling people that  I was going on with my parasite  And  What did you do for Memorial Day?  I was at a barbecue  That's a terrible barbecue conversation  But we were talking about parasites  And somebody told me that  They had a friend  That had 
[03:40:30]  Something  Like a worm  Or a parasite  Come out of their butt  And then it went  Like when they were pooping  And then it went back up  In their butt  Why would you want that  In your system?  That's where I would draw the line  What if there's an organism  In your body  Making  Like  Its own little babies  And now it's  Giving birth  Inside of you  And there's all  Little baby organisms  In your colon  Then I would just go  Take medicine  If that was the case  And get rid of it  But you don't know  If that's the case  Because you're riding  The snake  Or whatever you're doing  I mean look 
[03:41:00]  You have no idea  What the case is  If I was sleeping  That's when it would affect me  If I was laying down  To go to bed  Yeah  Just the idea  I would start thinking  About the fact  That there is something  Living in my body  That's not me  But there's shit  Living in your body  There's shit living  In your pillows  And your mattress  No but you have  Direct evidence  That this thing  Is in your body  You look at your pillow  Under a microscope  There's all this  Fucking shit alive  Crawling all over you  My pillow is not  Affecting my bowel movements  I mean it could be 
[03:41:30]  Affecting your allergies  It could be affecting  A lot of things  My pillow is not  Affecting my bowel movements  You're shitting  Three times a morning  Well I mean  This was a good morning  What does that mean  It just means  It's a couple more times  I'm just regular  And are you still  Recording all of them  No no no  No because they're  A little more solid now  There's not a lot of  Sound  But you just keep going  Yeah  That's bad  It's great  That's dehydration  No it's not  It's not fine  I drink a huge thing  Of juice  Every single morning  I drink a lot of water  Vinny  Yeah 
[03:42:00]  What's up buddy  What's going on  I mean  I can relate to  Joy Kwan  Without having  Anything wrong with me  I shit five times a day  See  It's my average  I'm 25  I've been like that  My entire life  My parents thought  There was something  Wrong with me  Went to the doctor  And he was just like  No there's really  There's nothing wrong  It's not healthy  Five times a day  No it's not healthy  Technically you're supposed  To shit for every time  You eat  So if you have a full meal  Five times a day 
[03:42:30]  That's true  I've heard that  Who'd you hear it from  Doctors and shit  Oh a doctor  Yeah but you didn't  Believe the doctor  I just said you get  Dehydrated from diarrhea-ing  All day long  And you were like  Who says that  It's not diarrhea  It's normal full log  Yeah well you know what  Troy did not have this problem  Until he came back from Mexico  And started diarrhea-ing  All day every day  But maybe the parasite  Well if it's diarrhea  Then that's a different story  Absolutely  No it's not diarrhea  It's something wrong  Not anymore  No it's solid  That's what I said  But it's still so much of it  Maybe the parasite  Unclogged the pipes  Oh and now everything's 
[03:43:00]  Catching up with it  Yeah and now it's just  I'm back to being regular  You're not regular  It's three times already  This morning  I welcome that  Maybe that's the new regular  Yeah  That's the new normal  For Troy Kwan  If I could shit  Ten times a day  I would shit  So your theory is that  Maybe now that your  Stool is a little more firm  That maybe the parasite's gone  Yeah  And the parasite has  Cleared the way  For you to  Produce the stool  That you should have  Been producing all along  Yeah I'm a little  I'm clean  You're feeling optimistic  About this whole thing  The pipes are clean 
[03:43:30]  You're like this was  This whole parasite deal  Was a huge blessing  It was  And I don't want to go  To a doctor to tell me  That there's something wrong  Because he'll  Fuck up my mojo  Somebody told me  That they used to  Back in the days  To give like weight loss stuff  And they would give you  Like parasites  And you could eat the parasites  Right no  They also thought  A good cure for polio  Was leeches  They did all kinds of stuff  Back in the day  Those were wrong  They turned out to be incorrect  Leeches aren't all that bad  They're bad  No they're not  They just get on your skin  And suck your blood  They do nothing  To make you feel better  Yeah but if you have  Like an infection or something  You can put them on there 
[03:44:00]  And it sucks the infection out  That's not true  It's just not true  Regardless  Otherwise hospitals  Would have leeches  But they don't  You know what they have instead  That's a little archaic  They have antibiotics  Those are the things that work  Because there's money  To be made in  Pharmaceuticals now  You could sell leeches  You could farm leeches  But doctors aren't going to do that  You don't think  If doctors wanted to make  Some money selling leeches  They couldn't find a way  To sell leeches  They're not going to do that now  They're going to make money  On pharmaceuticals  That's a whole other racket  Trust me  I'm not a big  Pharmaceuticals guy  But if I had a parasite 
[03:44:30]  I would probably be like  Just get this out of me  I'm fine with it  Ken in St. Louis  Hey Troy  Yo  Hey man  Last two times  I went to Mexico  First time I got back  I almost shit myself  On the plane  Did horrible for two weeks  Wife had me go to the doctor  It cost me $300  To find out I had diarrhea  Yeah  This time I just got back  Had it for almost three weeks  The last two weeks 
[03:45:00]  It's been perfect  Just went away  Fuck it  I'm not spending $300 again  Exactly  Maybe it's just the cost of the trip  Maybe it's just like  Every reward has a cost  I had a wonderful time in Mexico  The cost is  You can be shitting for a few weeks  Exactly  And I don't mind that  You don't  I mean shitting in my sleep  Is a problem  Right  I remember that story  But just having to go to the bathroom  Regularly  I'm fine with it  Yeah  Alright  Alright  Well  I am still going to be asking  For updates as the days go along  I hope you're okay with that  And I made a good song out of it  Great song out of it 
[03:45:30]  Do you have that in the system  Eric yet?  It's disgusting  It's great  Oh  Oh  That last one's  Oh  Yeah  It's still  Just floppy  It's gross  It's really really gross  But it is melodic  Yeah  And you know what I mean  They ask you to tape your shits 
[03:46:00]  And to do something big  And over the top  And that's big and over the top  Yeah  I applaud it  I applaud it  The reason  And I'm glad we played a little music  Because the real reason I have you in here  Is music oriented  Is because  Just over a year ago  Troy  You came in here  And you said  Sam  I gotta play you a song  And you played me a song  By a  A little known Canadian artist  Her name's Carly Rae Jepsen  And the song was called  Call Me Maybe  And you were like  Sam you gotta hear this 
[03:46:30]  This is gonna be the new shit  And I said  Troy  This was a song that played  Nobody had heard it yet  No  And Hits One was not playing it yet  They were not on it yet  And they could say they were  Because they do say they were  But they fucking weren't  No they so weren't  We have the evidence  This is a live show  So  We're playing this song  Opening it up to this whole new audience  We must have played it nine times  In a row that day  Yeah  Maybe more  Possibly more  And you and I together  Declared that this will be  The song of the summer  Yeah  And Troy Kwan 
[03:47:00]  Last summer  What was the song of the summer?  Call Me Maybe  Call Me Maybe  So Troy  I was doing some thinking  I was driving around  With the wife  Memorial Day weekend  I was listening to Hits Radio  Seeing what she was reacting to  Paying attention to what was going on  On YouTube  Thinking what was going on  On Hits One  And I'm thinking  It's time that you and I  Get together and figure out  What's gonna be this song  Of the summer this year  Okay  And I've got  Three possibilities  And  One  I'll go with  This is my first one 
[03:47:30]  This is a reach  It's a new song  And I think it's only because  It's very reminiscent  Of songs of the summer  From when like  I was in high school  Because it's a boy band  Okay  And it's kind of a throwback  To that  And it hasn't been done a lot  But  I was noticing  I was driving around  Hits One is playing the shit  Out of it  The station's here in New York  Z100  92.3 Now  Both those channels  Are playing the shit  Out of this song  At the moment  It's a new song  And for a song to be new 
[03:48:00]  On Memorial Day  It kind of makes it tough  Because a song in the summer  I feel like has to be around  A little bit before  Right  But  This is  The band's called  Emblem Three  And it's not a club song  It's a pop song  Okay  I think the name of the song  Is Chloe  Look up Emblem Three  Eric  Because this is a band  There's a boy band  And they were on X Factor  This is my reach  For song of the summer  You got it?  I'm looking  It's not in the lead  Hang on  Yeah  It's definitely in profit  Call Me Maybe  Was a sure bet 
[03:48:30]  Yes  I was like  I am sure of this  I saw a reaction  In the clubs for it  There's nothing this year  That's really like  It's much more of a risk  This year  Okay  Listen to this Emblem Three song  And again  It's a throwback  To maybe  You know  You'll remember  It's like  Very kind of  Late 90's boy band  Okay  But it might be time for that  Now keep in mind  I'm not advocating  That we go out  And listen to this song  Right  I don't like this song  It's a very feminine song  You're just saying 
[03:49:00]  It's the song of the summer  You're trying to call it  Song of the summer  You gotta give it to the hook  Of course  Yeah  It's kind of got that  Bad boy but safe thing  Sounds like LFO  Yup  Is this the hook? 
[03:49:30]  Not yet  This is the  This is the hook  Chloe  I know your sister  Turns everyone on  But  Oh baby  I have your dad  You're the one that I want  You think she's got it all  But that don't make her bad  You've got my heart 
[03:50:00]  And that's the only thing that matters  Chloe  I know your sister  Turns everyone on  But you're the one that I want  It's a reach  It's formulaic  I mean but there's just so much that sounds like that already  Absolutely  It's like Bowling for Soup or Fountains of Wayne  Absolutely  It just hasn't happened in a while  There's not that much right now that sounds like that  There's a lot of stuff before that sounds like that  We just have to see how a new generation reacts to it 
[03:50:30]  All I know is they're playing the shit out of it right now  So they're pushing it  That's a reach  That's not my prediction  Okay  To reach  My other  The song of right now  That I feel like has a shot  And I don't think is going to do it  But has a shot  Is Blurred Lines  Yeah  By Robin Thicke  That's my pick  Really?  Yeah  Okay  That song is fucking hot  It is  Yeah  It's just funky  And once you see the video  If nobody's seen the video for this  Google the unrated version of this  The girl that is in this video 
[03:51:00]  Is just fucking stunning  Yes  And she's topless the entire time  And that's how they get guys  Watching it  It lured me in in a second  Who is he doing this song with?  Pharrell  Robin Thicke and Pharrell  Is Pharrell trying to do Michael Jackson through the background?  Kinda  I mean that's the thing going on right now  And Pharrell's been doing that forever though  Yeah  And T.I. is on it too  Yeah T.I. ruined it  This song is just hot  It's just funky 
[03:51:30]  Yeah  Yeah this has a huge shot  Yeah  This has to be it  Well it's a song of right now  Unless a super big party song comes out  Well hang on  Cause I got a song that I think might do it  That's been doing it for a while  But it has never  It hasn't quite yet  Cause I don't think the Daft Punk song is gonna do it  You know what though?  People are loving it man  And it's growing on me  It's growing on me  It's not as good as this song  No this was better 
[03:52:00]  But it has grown on me  I think the Daft Punk song is gonna fizzle out  I don't think it's gonna last  This song I think it'll last the summer  Here's my other song  It's been around for a while  But it's had a nice slow build  And I know you're a fan of it  Icona Pop  Yeah  That has a real shot at being sung in the summer  I think it's called  I Don't Care  Yeah  Icona Pop  Yeah  Wait what  What's your song called?  I Don't Care  I C O N A 
[03:52:30]  Yeah I'm looking at it  Sure that's the title  Don't Care  Of the song  What do you  There's two songs  There's Good For You and I Love It  I Love It  Okay  There's two  There's two lines in the chorus  It's either I Don't Care and I Love It  This song I think  This song's big  This is my song in the summer  Yeah  This one  And they're both hot  Yes  Aren't they Swedish?  Something  Doesn't matter  This is my pick  I mean as soon as that comes on in the club  As soon as they hear that first vocal 
[03:53:00]  Girls scream  And I think it's got a while before it's played out  And it sounds different  Yeah  And it gets to the catchy part really quick  And it's short  It's only like 2 minutes 30 seconds or something  And it's girls  Yeah  Bitches Love Bitches  And all the girls that are in their 20s now  Because they mentioned being a 90s bitch  In this song  And so everybody's like  I'm a 90s bitch  Yeah and I'm seeing  See that's the thing  Is you have to  What makes a song a hit for the summer 
[03:53:30]  Is it has to  There has to be a line in it  That you can put on a t-shirt  Yeah  90s bitch  I'm a 90s bitch  Or I love 90s bitches  Or you know  Listen  This is it  It's not even singing  It's just yelling and chanting  So every girl's gonna wanna do this whole thing  Yeah but everybody screams right here  Yeah this is it  This is it  And I'm gonna tell you something too  Club music is so much bigger now 
[03:54:00]  Cause people don't listen to the radio like they used to  No  And there is no MTV  So it's like when something is big  And 15 year old 16 year old girls go to clubs  Yeah  So when there's a song that's big in a club  That's where a lot of the exposure is coming from there  Yeah  And they're gonna go and look at that up on YouTube  And find it on  And then they'll find it on the radio or whatever  Yeah  But the radio is a step behind the club music and all this  Yeah  And I gotta tell you  You know who else is  Has two songs that are still really big  Who?  Macklemore  Yeah actually 
[03:54:30]  James in North Carolina  We're just gonna bring that up  What's up James?  What's up guys?  Yeah I was gonna say  Macklemore and Lewis  How about Thrift Shop?  That's pretty fucking big  And I think he's got what  Same Sexes  Or  No Can't Stop Us  Or Can't Hold Us  Yeah yeah Can't Hold Us  Can't Hold Us  I mean he's also got the big  Same Sex  This is huge too  Yeah  This is a big song  But I think it's huge right now  And it's too big right now  Like in August it's not gonna be big anymore  It'll still be good 
[03:55:00]  But it's not gonna  I mean I think it's actually  At it's peak now  I think Thrift Shop was probably  Bigger than this one  Yeah and Thrift Shop's kinda over  Yeah you still play it though  People still go crazy for it  But it's only  It's not June yet  No you're right  I'm telling you  Iconopop is the song of the summer  Yeah that's more of an anthem  Nick and  And you need an anthem  Nick and  Because what happened with  Carly Rae Jepsen  You could sing along after one  E-Rock you didn't know  The Iconopop song  No I did  I didn't remember this  I know I've heard that  And do you know the lyrics? 
[03:55:30]  Yeah  Exactly  You can sing along  You can sing along  Especially for girls  Yeah you said  A t-shirt having a theme  An anthem where they just go  It's the summer of I don't care  Nick in Colorado  Damien I don't know how you can say  That that song  Get Lucky's gonna fizzle out  It's just now starting to get big  Yeah it'll fizzle out  Speaking of throwback  It's got a little  Earth Wind and Fire feel to it  I know but nobody knows  What that is  Who's listening to it  Nobody who creates  The song of the summer  Has ever heard of  Earth Wind and Fire  And I'm telling you  I'm getting old  It's a big song 
[03:56:00]  And it will be very successful  Earth Wind and Fire  Like post disco  Like Michael Jackson era  But I mean  Half the kids who listen to  Who pick the song of the summer  Don't know who Michael Jackson is  Yeah but that's just  What happens though  I mean everybody  Recycles  Of course  But it's not the song of the summer  And that really is yet to ever  Ever come back around  Earth Wind and Fire  No no no  Like Michael Jackson  Like off the wall era  Yeah it's time for it  To come back around  But that's not the song of the summer 
[03:56:30]  To me  I don't think  I don't know man  This one's going to be  Bigger than you think  And then they're going to  Put out a remix record too  So it may be  A danceier version of this  Maybe it'll be the remix  That takes one  And it'll take  It'll carry it  Throughout the summer  Nothing is striking me  Like a Conor Pop  No no no  I know  And I agree with you totally  Do you think that's  The song of the summer  You may  Before the end of the show  You need a declarative statement  On what is the song of the summer  I gave you three picks  I'm telling you  Song of the summer is Icona Pop  And you can take your time  To think about it  Icona Pop 
[03:57:00]  Hit  About like two months ago  Yep  That's the only reason  I think  I don't know if it's going to  Make it through the summer  It's had a very slow build  And it still hasn't hit its peak  I don't think  I still think  Robin Thicke's going to  You're still going  With that goddamn  Robin Thicke song  That's a catchy ass song  That is a motherfucker of a song  That is so good  This is the  Daft Punk song  J.C. and Red Bank  Hey Sam Roberts  Professional broadcaster  Now on the head  I'm a 41 year old  90s bitch 
[03:57:30]  That Icona Pop song  Is killing it  It is a slow build  Hasn't hit my suburban  Kickboxing gym yet  That's when I know  It's sort of over  Right  It's going to hit  It's going to hit  Right  It will  It will  Like for instance  This song  They'll go  They're  Because it sounds  Like this  This does sound familiar  And like older people  Can get into this  Because it's the  Earth, Wind, Fire  Samples and all this stuff  But this is the type of song  That will go to that guy's  Kickboxing gym  In 30 seconds  Like in no time  It'll be right to the  Kickboxing gym  Whereas Icona Pop 
[03:58:00]  Like it's really  Got to be  This is the song  Before they'll start  Playing it there  Because it's like  What is this?  Yeah  I just got a text  From Rob Cross  Icona Pop song  Of last summer  XMU was playing that shit  Back in June 2012  We'll tell Rob Cross  That XMU  Needs to like  Get some listeners  Or something  I don't know  I need to hear Rob Cross'  Prediction for the song  Yeah Rob Cross  Come in here  You know music  But don't give me  The indie bullshit  I'm not talking about  What they were playing  In Brooklyn last summer  He knows pop music  Rob is on top of shit 
[03:58:30]  And by the way  Rob's channel  XMU  Absolutely plays  A ton of shit  Before it becomes big  Absolutely  They're good  At picking  Yes  What's going to be big  I mean it takes like  A year  You're literally a year  And Icona Pop  Has been around forever  I mean a year  But that's forever  But like I said  That slow build  Is exactly what you need  Yeah  And that's what's  Going to make people  Not get tired of it  And that's what's  Going to make like  You know once the kids  Find out about it  The people listening to XMU  Already know about it 
[03:59:00]  And it just explodes  And it hasn't exploded yet  What's going on Travis?  My four year old  Yeah  Was on Icona Pop  About two months ago  Yeah  I'm not joking  She listens to the entire album  Almost every day  Wow  And that's a four year old  Because a four year old  Can get it  So to me it's a little old  Yeah  But I have noticed  It's just  It just keeps building  Yeah  I completely agree with you  And as far as music goes  You're probably a lot hipper  Than most dads are  I guess  You tend to stay aware of  Yeah yeah yeah  What's happening  Yeah 
[03:59:30]  Why is Rob on the phone?  He's down the hall  He can't make it  He has to go to something  But he called here  I'm going to put him up  On the mic  So he can tell you  His summer pick  Rob  Rob Cross  Song of the summer  He sang Blurred Lines  I don't know if you heard that  He said Blurred Lines  But Rob  Rob is saying Blurred Lines  I'm going with you Sam  You're going with Icona Pop  Absolutely  100%  That's the debate right now  I think we're all in agreement  All these songs are going to be big  I mean Emblem 3 might not be  But Daft Punk  Is going to be a big song  Yeah  I don't think anybody  I think everybody in here  Has decided it's not going to be 
[04:00:00]  The song of the summer  No  No  It's a big song  It's up there though  It's not going to be the song of the summer  And just wait until they remix it  Right  It's going to be big  But it's not going to be  Right now  We are at a tie  Where the debate is  Icona Pop  Or Blurred Lines  But you're saying  All of your points are so dead on though  Like it gets to the hook  Like right away  Right away  It's so accessible  It's a fun song  Your four year old can sing  And my four year old wants to listen to it  And she can sing along  She knows it's like  Yeah  I don't care 
[04:00:30]  It seems rebellious  Right  You know what I mean  It's like  You know  Let's go to Eric in Syracuse  Oh where are you  How's it going guys  What's up Eric  Hey I'm thinking  Will.i.am featuring the Biebs  That power  No way  That song is growing though  It's picking up a little bit of steam  It's new  And it might  It might be good  I don't know  I like Icona Pop  I think it's going to be tough to beat it  It's going to be Icona Pop  It's not going to be the song of summer  But that song is gaining a lot of steam  Yeah  This is gaining some heat 
[04:01:00]  Yep  I got to agree with my man  I guess we're out of time  But let's go around the room then  The bottom line  Song pick  Rob Cross said Blurred Lines  Eric  Blurred Lines  Travis  Icona Pop  Troy  Icona Pop is going to be the song of the summer  Okay  But  Okay  I prefer Blurred Lines  But song of the summer  Icona Pop  Icona Pop  We settled it  Rob  Eric  You can go have your romantic getaway  And listen to all the Robin Thicke that you want  Because Icona Pop is the song of the summer 
[04:01:30]  And  Tomorrow's show  We got to play some Icona Pop  So people realize that we're calling this shit  Because  People have played Icona Pop  Nobody's calling Icona Pop is the song of the summer  It's going to be the song of the summer  You know what  Robin Thicke's in Sirius a lot  We should get him on here  Why?  He's not in the song of the summer  He needs to be in  He's second place  He's the man  Yeah I know  But we're not here  We're not the silver metal show  Okay  We need Icona Pop in the studio  Because they're the song of the summer  Because Carly Rae Jepsen didn't get in here  That bitch  Yeah  That bitch
