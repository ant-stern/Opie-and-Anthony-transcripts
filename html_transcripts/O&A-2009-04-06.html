<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Robertson and E-Rock filling in for the absent hosts.  This was immediately preceded by a sarcastic introduction from Jimmy Fallon, who wryly declared the following segment "the worst of Opie and Anthony."  The segment itself consisted of a profane rap song, incorporating the melody of "Pop Goes the Weasel." The lyrics were heavily laden with vulgarity, boasting, insults directed at other artists, and references to the music industry, specifically sampling and copyright issues. The rapper (either a guest or one of the fill-in hosts) employed extensive use of slang and metaphors to convey their criticisms and braggadocio.  The exact identity of the rapper is unclear from the provided summary.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's all sing Pop Goes the Weasel. 
[00:00:30]  Let's all sing Pop Goes the Weasel and draw and drop, drop, drop.  Why not take your top ten pop head? Fix the music and make sense, those rhymes fit.  I guess it's the fact that you can't be autistic. Intricate raps becoming so simplistic.  I got a strong mind that doesn't have to be spoon fed, and I can read her, doesn't have to be read. 
[00:01:00]  So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked, you go the ways of the weasel.  Pop Pop Goes the Weasel, the weasel.  Pop goes the weasel, cause the weasel goes by.  Hip-hop got turned into hip-hop, the second old record was number one on the pop chart.  The adults get on the hunt, they gotta start in the ghetto, let no one forget about the hard part. 
[00:01:30]  Now in 91 we got a new brand, a new band, looking like the same old clan.  Same old D, the ski, so we gotta make sure that real rappers got to endure.  Why score more points in one period appearing in complex structure like a pyramid?  The paper for the media presence.  You learn lessons from the face of false legend.  Stop vexing on a scale, you ain't originate the thin ice.  You skate upon a break and set you straight.  Ain't up on the plate, now who's diesel?  Not the weasel, not the weasel. 
[00:02:00]  Pop goes the weasel, pop goes the weasel, the weasel.  You stole somebody's record then you looped it, you looped it.  You boosted the record then you looped it, you looped it.  Yo, I came from Cali and they hooped it, they hooped it.  But now you're getting sued, kind of stupid. 
[00:02:30]  Boosted traps get slaps, you got no haps.  To reach the fourth corner of the maps, for the kids in Kansas.  To those who speak Spanish, doing crazy damage so the wack gets banished.  Can't manage the truth until you're byway.  You ain't quick so you switch off the exit from a highway.  Arrest but a crook, have to take a second look.  Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?  But the minister plonk can lay laws.  A-O-P nice, rip the mic and go for yours.  Gold's for mine, I gold's for mine.  The prime won't eat the green eggs and swine. 
[00:03:00]  Online like to search in a hoodie with a woody.  Get a disco tape, it's Sam Goody.  Why'd you run through the door from left open?  Roping off the seams of the crime smoking.  I got platinum, I'm nothing like a stud, see?  Flowing up like I'm throwing up a beef patty.  Sellouts run about like the measles.  No choice cause pop goes the weasel.  Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel.  Pop pop goes the weasel cause the weasel goes pop.  Pop, pop goes the weasel, the weasel. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, it's Jimmy Fallon. This is the worst of Opie and Anthony, which really means Opie and Anthony went on paid vacations and these two had to work and be fired. Here's primetime Sam Robertson, E-Rock. And oh yeah, what's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC? </pre>
