<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an unidentified song and transitioned into the hosts discussing their new XM Satellite Radio show, High Voltage 202, their past success, and their two-year hiatus following a controversial incident.  They immediately launched into a discussion of mysterious occurrences in their studio – missing music files, a lighter, and a radio – speculating about sabotage.  The conversation shifted to New York City's smoking bans, leading to anecdotes about smoking in casinos and bars, including one charging $2 per cigarette. This segued into a broader discussion on American freedoms compared to other countries,  humorously exploring the consequences of defying laws.

Jim Norton called in from Albany, facing initial technical difficulties that fueled the hosts' sabotage suspicions.  He complained about his hotel and Rich Voss's compulsive smoking and phone calls, describing Voss's co-dependency on his girlfriend. Opie and Anthony teased Norton relentlessly.  The technical issues returned to the forefront, reinforcing their belief in sabotage.  They reminisced about their successful “Demented World” CD and the dishonest dealings of their record label, playing an excerpt from a prank call segment titled "Tourette's Whorehouse." The show concluded its first part with discussions on restaurant bathroom attendants expecting tips and handwashing habits.

The next segment focused on Anthony Cumia's germophobia, his aversion to post-bathroom/meal handshakes ("hand jobs by proxy," "blowjobs by proxy"), and low pay for bathroom attendants.  A listener called, claiming Opie preferred fisting to handshakes.  The hosts discussed their sleep deprivation and hectic schedule, mentioning a planned "show and tell" segment and an audio clip eliciting moans (later identified as a drill-dildo sex recording). Brother Joe's SARS song was played, followed by a customer service call featuring an angry customer. They criticized their Washington, D.C. staff for repetitive George Carlin bits and lack of coordination.  Stephen Lynch's "Craig" was played, followed by a lengthy discussion on white people playing the blues and a dislike for chick flicks like “Bridges of Madison County.”  A trucker from Nebraska called, and the hosts discussed their staff, including a security guard, "Master Poe," and their desire to obtain a copy of the pornographic video "Century Sex."  The segment concluded with a listener call leading to a discussion of Martha Stewart's prison sentence and plans to christen a wiffle bat.

The following segment started with a discussion of their co-workers' sleep habits (Ben's minimal sleep, Opie's Ambien reliance), a desire for female guests, and the advantages of satellite radio's explicit content allowance.  The centerpiece was a listener-submitted audio recording of a woman being sexually stimulated with a drill-attached dildo, followed by sexually charged banter and listener calls.  Rob, the submitter, identified the woman as his ex-girlfriend and detailed the device's creation and filming of the encounter.  The conversation turned to mocking Howard Stern's perceived jealousy and obsession with them, alongside discussions of Lindsay Lohan's weight and Tatum O'Neil's scandalous memoir.  Opie reluctantly performed his "show and tell," revealing a pickled fetus in a jar given to him by Andrew Gore.

The next excerpt began with the hosts discussing a disturbing object found in an olive jar, followed by a prank call where a listener was tricked into believing he won $100,000 (it was a candy bar).  A sexually explicit song about a prostitute played.  Kevin Smith called in as a guest, discussing Star Wars special editions and the upcoming *Clerks* DVD.  The hosts discussed satellite radio's advantages and disadvantages, including the lack of FCC restrictions.  A discussion about film purchasing methods followed. A significant portion involved interaction with a CBS News reporter, Kelly, who was filming a segment; the hosts engaged in deliberately crude humor, including a description of the drill-dildo audio.  The discussion covered the move to satellite radio and the lack of FCC regulations.  Hedda called in, describing the show as a drug. The segment ended with further discussion of the move to satellite radio and the lack of FCC oversight, with mentions of Black Earl and Frenchie outside the studio.

The final segment began with discussions about the CBS News filming and potential fallout.  A rambling discussion about historical empires, compared to the game Risk, and a hypothetical future "vomitarium" in America, along with a tangent on the Austro-Hungarian Empire ensued.  A commercial break featured ads for Chip Talk, XM Satellite Radio, and Liquid Metal.  Upon returning, they further discussed the CBS News interview, expressing self-deprecating humor about their behavior. They mentioned earlier edgy content and warned listeners against listening to the replay.  They interacted with a CBS News reporter in the studio.  Anecdotes about John Madden, fan interactions, and a crew member, Earl, followed.  They discussed the CBS News segment's airtime and their families' reactions. Opie described his mother's reaction, contrasting satellite radio with his terrestrial radio days. They lamented the loss of their "Bit of the Week" segment due to suspected sabotage.  A "What Did We Learn" segment followed, with callers sharing humorous takeaways, often referencing crude or sexually suggestive content.  This led to a final anecdote from Opie about a disastrous Cancun vacation, culminating in a "butt plug" prank call, and the show's sign-off.  The segment contained numerous sexually explicit and offensive jokes and comments.

[00:06:30]  Every day, more people jumping aboard, Anthony, turning on their XM satellite radios. 
[00:07:00]  Welcome to you and yours for checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Welcome, brand new bunch of people who just got your XM radio and activated it.  Brand new people every day, Opie.  We are the true underdogs.  We understand that.  We were on top of the world two years ago doing afternoon radio in many, many cities across America.  I remember that.  And then we were yanked off the air. 
[00:07:30]  Yank.  For a legal broadcast, by the way.  Oh, morally, it wasn't good.  Oh, it was bad judgment.  We understand that now.  We learned.  Some people were very upset.  Very upset by our actions.  And then our old company held us to our contracts, made us sit out for two years, took away everything we ever did.  So we got to start from scratch.  Brand new.  Everything's got to be new.  So we are the underdogs.  We understand that. 
[00:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  Eventually, hopefully sooner than later, this will be a well-oiled machine, Anthony.  Well-oiled?  Well-oiled?  You don't like that?  A well-oiled machine.  A well-oiled machine, right.  Oh, working out the bugs every day and adding bits every day.  New faces and old faces dropping in the studio every day.  Sure.  We're slowly but surely building the new O&A show.  And I can't be more excited than I am today.  I'm slowly building my favorites list on my computer. 
[00:08:30]  For some reason, every day, the favorites that I mark off, because I like being able to go from one web page to another.  Important little web pages, Opie, like Drudge Report and Fox News' page and things like that, just to keep updated on current events and things that are happening.  And for some reason, it disappears on a daily basis.  Things disappear around here.  That's what I've noticed in the week that we've been coming here.  Some things disappear.  Well, there's a new list of problems today. 
[00:09:00]  Not so much the equipment, which is nice.  Everything's being sorted out.  Well, this is our channel, High Voltage 202, right?  Mm-hmm.  And we start every day at 5 a.m.  I don't know when you're listening to this show.  A lot of people hear it live.  Other people hear it in the afternoon.  I have no idea.  But 5 a.m. Eastern Time, we start playing some kick-ass rock and roll to get you psyched for the show.  Have some fun, sure.  And Ben helps out and programs the damn thing for us to get everyone psyched.  And he programmed a nice hour of music for today's show, and it disappeared. 
[00:09:30]  It was really good, too.  I really blew it up.  I had a lot of songs.  Stones, who?  Why would the music just disappear?  So then we had to play the music from yesterday, which was a kick-ass set, but, you know.  But we want to change it up a little bit.  Yeah, we definitely want some variety on this channel.  And that just disappeared off of the computer?  As did, you saw my new lighter that I had yesterday.  I got this brand-new lighter.  That's gone.  It's all different.  The radio out there that I was listening to, that dickhead out there, you know, yelled at me for yesterday. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  That's gone.  That's gone?  Does anyone else...  Yeah, so you can't even listen to the show out there.  Oh, well, that kind of seems obvious who would have taken that.  Well, that'll all change.  Does anyone else use this studio?  No.  I think we're going to get a lock.  We do have to get a lock, because all the buttons are switched around every day.  Yeah, the boards shouldn't change.  Look, it's hard enough for Anthony and I to build this brand-new show.  We got our work cut out for us.  But to come in here, and then, you know, we're trying to figure out all the new equipment, 
[00:10:30]  and then have all the buttons reset and changed and this and that every morning,  and the computer favorites all gone.  Someone is messing with us.  Passwords are different.  I log on, because now I'm assuming my favorites aren't up here,  because it's logged in under someone else's password.  Like, each time you log in, it's like a brand-new computer, Opie.  If there's someone in the building, on this floor, that has a problem with us,  then come in the studio and face us. 
[00:11:00]  I don't think that's going to happen.  I've got another puzzle for you.  If you are wise, you'll listen to me.  If you have a problem with us, come in now, and we'll settle it.  Waddle in here.  Stop being a pussy and doing things behind our back.  Now you're making accusations, Opie.  I did not.  I asked if there was someone that had a problem.  You're implying that he's doing things behind our back. 
[00:11:30]  Somebody is.  Things are disappearing.  Yeah.  Somebody is.  What if Ben need a lighter for?  You smoke?  No.  I got this brand-new shortopia.  I got a $50 lighter.  He likes smoking cigars.  I got it the other night.  I left it right here, and it was gone.  Oh, there's still places to smoke in the city?  There's a few.  Really?  Yeah.  There's one that's breaking the law right by the office here, but there's actually like  10 legal places.  I'm kind of, you know, when Mayor Bloomberg here in New York City first came out with 
[00:12:00]  this smoking ban, I was like, no, man.  Fight the power, man.  You know, if people want to smoke, they should be allowed to.  Freedom, man.  And now, I don't want anyone smoking anywhere.  I'm horrible.  I'm one of those people.  You're just smoking brains out.  I know.  But I'm one of those people now where it's like, it's kind of nice to go out and come  home and not have the whole house smell like your sweater because it's covered in smoke.  Well, this is what I don't understand.  And they're digging it now.  I don't understand this. 
[00:12:30]  If you own a bar, okay, why aren't you allowed to let people smoke in your bar?  Because it's a legal substance.  Because the people that work there, that's what Bloomberg was saying, is the people that  work there shouldn't be subject.  They don't work in that bar.  Yeah, but, you know, that might be the job they can get.  I'm not a smoker.  And I'm like you.  I'm glad that there's no smoking anymore because you can wear clothes like more than  once, things like that.  You can breathe, you know.  Yeah.  But I don't get that.  You know, it's a legal substance that they're telling people you're not allowed to have people  smoking in your establishment. 
[00:13:00]  I don't get that.  This is America.  They're saying it's a health threat.  Well, then when you're getting your workers, you know, on the application, do you mind  working in a smoking environment?  They shouldn't have to be subjected to that sort of smoke.  And then on top of that, all right, so we lost that battle, okay?  We lost that battle.  I get it.  And I hate smokers and I hate smoking, but I...  You hate smokers, too?  Well, yeah.  Just throw a blanket over everybody.  I'm sorry.  I hate the smoker.  All right, I hate cigarette smoke, okay? 
[00:13:30]  Made me stop gambling up in Mohegan Sun.  Went up there in Foxwoods, went to Foxwoods, and they have a no-smoking part of the casino,  which is pretty cool.  Went in there, but they close it down at about two in the morning.  So then at two, I figure, ah, you know, I still want to do some gambling.  And I went into the smoking section.  Here's what you have to sit next to.  Either some Asian guy or an Arab guy that is smoking, like, two at a time. 
[00:14:00]  And the ashtray's right next to you, and they're just blowing smoke, and you can't breathe.  I mean, you cannot breathe.  So I had to leave the table after, like, ten minutes.  I couldn't lose any more money.  I was pissed.  There was a sports arena in Rochester that was smoke-free, except for one room that you  were allowed to smoke in.  And the nickname of the place was called The Tomb.  The Tomb.  Yeah, sometimes in airports that you go to around the country, sometimes they have, like,  a glass room, and you can watch the smokers throw it.  You can just watch them getting cancer. 
[00:14:30]  It's amazing.  The whole room is just full of smoke.  Oh, there's vents at the top and filters and fans that aren't doing anything.  And you look in there and go, how could you even step in there?  Right.  You just stink.  You know, two things about the law.  What's funny is they can still sell cigarettes in restaurants that you can't smoke in.  You can still sell cigarettes, but you can't smoke them in there, which is weird.  Yeah, you could buy a pack for eight bucks or whatever the hell the going rate is now.  All right, so we lost that battle.  Mm-hmm.  All right, now there's, like, cigar bars in New York that they're trying to close down. 
[00:15:00]  The whole reason those places are open is so you could go and have a cigar.  Same principle.  And I don't smoke cigars either.  Yeah, but that's the whole reason that these places are in business.  Yeah.  This is a place for people to go to smoke.  You're not stumbling into this place going, oh, my God, I didn't know people were going  to be smoking in here.  Yeah.  Well, they say that the employees are in danger.  But it doesn't make sense to me that they're allowed to shut down, you know, even smoking  lounges. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, this is a place to go that's specifically for smoking.  Pretty much, yeah.  And they're shutting them down.  It's like little finger food, and they got their whiskeys and stuff in a full bar.  Yeah, like, that's fine, because I'm not going to go in there.  But most people go there to have a cigar, and they're trying to shut those places down.  I don't get that.  There's a place downtown called Hudson Bar and Books that you can't get into, because  you can still smoke there, because so much of their business is tobacco.  But if, say, you go in there to smoke cigarettes, they charge you two bucks for every cigarette  you smoke while you're in there.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  How do they know how many are smoking? 
[00:16:00]  I think it's the honor system, but it's pretty funny.  The place is packed.  You can't even get in there any night of the week now.  How do they charge you?  Does somebody come up to you and say two bucks, or they give you a bill?  There's a sign when you walk in, and then there's a sign at every table, and there's  a sign at the bar and everything, yeah.  Or if you bring in your own cigar, you know, because they sell it all in there.  I'm trying to figure out how they do it.  I think it's the honor system, you know?  I mean, how do you keep track of everyone smoking cigarettes?  I mean, people, you know, raise their throat.  Really?  Yeah, especially in a crowded room.  Wow, that's really weird.  What's the justification of two bucks?  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  That's a good question.  Is it costing them money for you to come in there and smoke?  Well, because you're not buying the cigarettes there.  God, that's hysterical.  They should just allow smoking establishments.  This is supposed to be America, land of the free.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure there are a lot of smoke still in Iraq.  Yeah, yeah.  Iraq does seem to be a little more free than we are here, because you're not free to do  a lot of things.  That's really the selling point of America has been for many years is, hey, you know,  it's America, man. 
[00:17:00]  We're free to do whatever you want to do.  It's a free country.  Thank God we're free to do.  And the truth of the matter is, you're really not free to do much of anything.  You're free to adhere to all of the rules.  That's what you're free to do.  There's more rules every day.  Every single day, there's more rules in this country.  Every single day, more rules.  The second they notice that you're free to do something, they have to regulate it.  I remember reading about a month ago, there's some kind of way to atomize booze, to make 
[00:17:30]  it like a mist, and you put this mask on, and you breathe in the booze.  I love that story.  It takes about 20 minutes to do a shot.  You sit back.  Now, 20 minutes to do a shot.  I could do like five shots in 20 minutes.  You're hanging out with your friends, drinking a few beers and stuff.  So it takes 20 minutes to inhale this shot.  And instead of going through your stomach, you're getting the effects like you would if 
[00:18:00]  you smoked something.  It's a mister.  You know, it mists the booze.  And immediately, well, we need regulations against this.  This is horrible.  This is...  No, why is it so bad?  You're drinking it or ingesting it slower than you would if you were drinking it.  Yeah, you're controlling your drinking.  But everyone freaked out because it's alcohol, and it's some new way to do it.  So, well, no, no, we got to figure out a way.  We got to see if this can still be picked up on the breathalyzer. 
[00:18:30]  We got to figure out if this is dangerous.  We got to figure out if people need to be saved from this, if the kids are going to start  using it.  So we need regulation.  You're really not free to do anything.  Stop regulating.  Yeah, please.  You're driving us nuts.  Are you free to, if you wanted to, on a whim, just go outside naked, outside your house,  and sit on a lounge chair in the sun on your front property that you own with nothing on? 
[00:19:00]  A man can dream.  You know something?  You're absolutely not free to do that.  No.  You're free.  Can you just go outside in your backyard and start blasting off some rounds into a phone  book in your backyard?  No.  You would get arrested.  You can't discharge firearms within the city limits unless it's in a perfect spot.  Let's go a little further.  Are you free to take up arms against the government?  Well, that's why we have our right to bear arms, though.  Yeah, that old gag. 
[00:19:30]  Why don't you go outside right now and try to take up arms against the government and see  what happens?  Get a little militia together?  Yeah, you and your cute little gun while they bring in the helicopters, you idiots.  The Apaches and the tanks come after you.  You know, we need it because it's a deterrent to the government.  Right.  We need an armed society just in case we have to take the government out.  Oh, really?  You're going to use your deer rifle against a howitzer?  Really?  Do you have laser-guided missiles yet at your house? 
[00:20:00]  From my cold, dead head.  Oh, wait.  I have Alzheimer's.  From my cold, dead foot.  Isn't that the saying?  I forget.  Yeah, so you really, you know, it's a great selling point for the country.  And when the immigrants want to come over and become American, it's a great selling point.  Hey, you're free to do everything.  No.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Because you're really not free to do much of anything. 
[00:20:30]  Everything is regulated.  Everything costs money.  You can't just buy a car and start driving in a free country.  Shouldn't you be able to take your money that you earned and buy a car and just jump in it and start driving?  You should, but no.  You need a license.  You have to register it.  You have to inspect it.  It's got to, you know, you've got to adhere to all the rules on the road.  And if you screw up, they could take all that away from you.  I bet you in Iraq, you could just find one of those old Toyotas and just start driving around. 
[00:21:00]  An old Datsun pickup with a machine gun in the back.  You don't have to worry about registration.  I'm driving, my friend.  I'm driving.  I am truly free, my friend.  I'm driving.  You're free.  Now, Iraq.  You think they got car insurance in Iraq?  Iraq is a freer country right now than the United States of America.  It's also like the wild, wild west over there, but.  Which was a great time in America, too, from what I read.  I seem to, I think it was fun.  You could just get your horse, you ride out west, and pan for gold, Opie. 
[00:21:30]  And if somebody wanted your gold, they'd try to shoot you.  And you shoot back at them, and if you kill them, you're out of danger for a day or two.  There was a time, if you liked a piece of land, you just started living there.  You would stake your claim.  You know that river near your house?  Yeah.  Try to, like, just build a house there on your own.  Yeah.  If you see a nice piece of property that you like right by your house, why not just lay  down some walls and a roof on it and start living there and see what happens to you? 
[00:22:00]  Let's test this freedom thing today.  Try that one out.  Build a house on a nice piece of land by a river.  And till the ground.  And grow the corn.  And screw going to Home Depot.  Just start chopping down the trees and make your own log cabin.  Call yourself Paw Ingles.  Right.  And just build a soddy by the river.  Hey, you could save a lot of money.  Give it a try.  See what happens in the land of the free.  Take your buckboard into Sleepy Eye for some supplies and go back to the house you just built. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  See what happens.  See if there's someone waiting there for you.  Hey, what happened?  I just built my house by Plum Creek.  I figured I'd live here.  It's a nice plot of land.  Yeah.  It's a free country, isn't it?  Oh, it sure is.  It sure is.  I think you'd have some marshals there.  You think?  Your goods would be out.  And there'd be a big lock on the door of the house that you built.  There's no real freedom like that in the way that, you know, it was many, many years ago. 
[00:23:00]  They regulate everything.  You're not free to do anything.  You go to work.  You have to go to work every day to live in this country.  You can't not work and live in the United States of America.  You can't not work?  Have you walked around lately in the city?  And look and see what it is?  It's homeless people.  They're dregs of society in this country.  They're the outcasts, the people that you don't want around.  You can't just do that. 
[00:23:30]  And you have to work.  You've got to pay your taxes.  Right.  That's not free.  You make money and it's a 50% cut with the government?  They're your partner?  We're in it together, partner.  You know?  Well, that doesn't sound very free.  I mean, of course, people are going to say, well, look at the alternatives.  Yeah, I don't want to live in Iraq.  I don't want to live in a lot of countries that aren't free.  But don't be delusional and think you live in this great free nation where you are free 
[00:24:00]  to do anything and pursue these dreams and hopes.  No, you're really not.  Food prices are out of control.  Why don't you go collect your own food?  Hunt for your own food.  Why don't you give that a shot to see how free we really are?  And what?  You have to only be hungry during hunting season?  Is that what it is?  No, I'm hungry.  You know something?  As you're driving down...  I'm hungry right now and I like bear.  Bear for dinner.  Right.  I want a little tasty bear meat.  I'm going to go out and get a bear today.  You know something?  I drive down the highways and byways of this great nation of ours, Opie, and a lot of times 
[00:24:30]  you'll see a deer on the side of the road.  You're right?  Right.  Pull over, pull out your rifle, and take a beat on his little deer head and just blast  it off.  Now throw it on your fender or whatever it is, and take him home.  That's some good eating.  What's going to happen if you get caught with that deer?  You're going to be fined, if not arrested, for blasting off your rifle at the wrong place 
[00:25:00]  at the wrong time.  It doesn't seem truly free to me like that.  Why are we talking about freedom today?  How did this start?  I don't know.  I think, are we free to run this station without an Oompa Loompa?  I think that's probably how it started.  Oh, that's how it started.  I don't know.  We're missing a member of the team today.  We got a check.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Little Jim Norton is in Albany.  Mm-hmm.  He might have fell asleep.  Hello.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[00:25:30]  Jimmy?  Hello.  Oh, boy.  Do the phones work?  Oh, boy.  Hang in there, Jimmy.  Jimmy!  Don't hang up, Jimmy.  Here comes Jaime.  Like, I think talking louder is going to help.  Jaime fixes everything.  Here's Jaime.  He'll fix it.  Jaime.  All right.  Jaime.  Hello?  Wow.  He had to push six buttons so far.  He's still trying to figure it out, Anthony.  He's studying the board.  He works that board like a Simon Says game, doesn't he?  They're all lighting up, and he's got to keep track of what lit up and what tone played.  He hung up. 
[00:26:00]  Jimmy hung up.  Did he hung up?  He couldn't be bothered.  You sure he hung up?  Jimmy.  Hello.  Hey, can you hear us?  Oh, he's there.  He's there.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hello?  No?  All right.  Here's today's problem.  Are you screwing with us, Jimmy?  Now, see, logically, this doesn't make sense.  This goes back to what we were saying at the beginning of the show.  Phones worked yesterday.  Phones worked perfectly fine when we left the studio.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Jimmy?  Yeah, can you guys hear me?  I can hear you.  Yeah, what's wrong with you, man?  We've been talking to you for like five minutes. 
[00:26:30]  I got clicked off.  As soon as you said our little Jimmy Norton's missing, it went to me.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was saying hello, hello, and there was nothing happening.  Really?  We got you.  Now, for some reason, yeah, we leave the studio, and when we're done with this show, everything  is working fine.  We've sorted out the bugs throughout the program of the day.  And then when we come in the next morning, everything's screwed up again, because somebody's  screwing with us.  Screwing with us.  Well, I think that if you want to solve the mystery, what you do is you go out of the computer 
[00:27:00]  and check the last sites visited, and if you see that one of them was Alcoholics Anonymous,  you'll know it's Steve C. who's been sabotaging everything.  You know, that's not very nice.  It's not.  Look on the keyboard and see if there's a smidgen of chocolate.  Maybe there's a little dab of chocolate, a little dollop.  As there is, go out and smack that 1970s vagina hair face and tell him to get on the elevator  and ride it sideways and go home.  Well, he's here again at 5.30 in the morning just to cause us grief. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Hey, are you listening?  Come into the studio right now.  I want to slap your dandruff-ridden face, stupid.  Oh, wow.  Look at how brave you are from Albany.  You could have said that yesterday when he was 10 feet away from you.  I was hoping he'd walk in and crack Ben for that.  He really has an in for Ben.  He does.  Yeah, those two are going to go at it.  You're in Albany today, Jimmy?  Yeah, I took the ride up last night.  You want to talk about a smoke box?  I was in Voss's pre-war Mercedes.  My Mercedes. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, I think he bought that when Hitler was a union rep.  He's the worst Jew ever.  He is the worst.  He has just turned completely against his people and everything they believe in and stand for.  He's got tattoos.  And as you know, that's not a thing that the Jews do.  I believe it's not too kosher, Anthony.  It's not kosher.  He has tattoos.  He drives a Mercedes, and he's dumb.  You know, actually, he's a disgrace to Jews all over the world.  Because they're typically very bright. 
[00:28:30]  And Voss is just...  This is what he said to me last night in the car.  He said that he was on stage at his last thing, and he said the audience kept applausing during his act.  Applausing?  They were applausing.  They were applausing during my act.  I was hungry after the act, so I went out and got some tortillas.  Because all I had all day was a lean cuisine.  What a moron.  He pronounced silent L's.  Yeah.  He pronounced it silent L's.  We're driving up, and we're flipping around. 
[00:29:00]  Actually, I'm actually listening to a replay of the show, and we flip on the O'Reilly factor.  Yeah.  And Voss is not sometimes as dumb as people think.  This is completely true.  He goes, Bill O'Reilly leans to the right, doesn't he?  Leans to the right.  Leans to the right.  That's a great assessment.  Yeah.  It's kind of the same way Christopher Reeve leans in one direction when you strap away to him and body check him.  I wanted to bite his face. 
[00:29:30]  He really is stupid.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Oh, he leans to the right a little bit, and he was smoking the whole way up.  He smokes in his vehicle like that, so you're in a gas chamber.  I've never seen anyone smoke more than Rich Voss, by the way.  Dude, he's just the worst human being.  I mean, his fingernails are all messed up.  How does he hold the cigarette with those little nubs he calls fingers?  He dips his little fingers in glue, and then puts the...  Maybe he should get some white gloves, like the Oompa Loompa wear.  He's got midget hands. 
[00:30:00]  He's got those hands like midgets.  You ever shake hands with a midget, and it feels like you're shaking a muffin and some cocktail franks?  It's just like that awful feeling in your hand.  That's what Voss is like.  He's got a midget hand, a little puffy muffin hand with those cocktail wieners sticking out of it.  Because they don't bend properly, his fingers are straight, like Hummel fingers.  Yeah, yeah, they don't bend.  They don't have regular finger joints. 
[00:30:30]  And they certainly don't have any practice holding a pen or using a keyboard to write new material.  Awful, stiff little turtle feet fingers make me nauseous.  Hey, a bunch of truckers said they're coming to see you tonight, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm in the best Western.  I hate it up here.  But, I mean, the gig should be fun.  Rich is out actually doing something right now.  So, I mean, hopefully it'll be good.  I'm just really tired.  It was actually a nightmare when you guys called.  I was in the middle of some awful nightmare.  Really? 
[00:31:00]  What was the nightmare?  A room full of hookers and no money?  What was the nightmare?  That you actually had to work five days in a row for the Opie and Anthony show?  Listen, I will be there with Selton Monday morning.  Actually, the nightmare was that Bob was talking to me.  Yeah.  And I had just done a line and wanted to doze off but couldn't.  I hate doing phoners.  I really hate doing phoners.  No, you're good, bro.  You're good.  We'll pat you on the back.  You're fine.  You're all right.  No, that's all right.  You guys had such a nice flow going. 
[00:31:30]  I know.  You kind of killed it.  Aw.  No, no.  Kind of.  I napalmed it.  I knew this would happen.  Oh, but I got good news for you.  What's that?  Tom from New Orleans is going to be calling in on Monday.  What's wrong with him?  Where's he been?  No, we finally found him.  He got another job in radio?  He'll be making his first appearance on the new Opie and Anthony show on Monday.  All right.  And we know how much you like Tom from New Orleans, so that should be fun.  All right.  Well, I'll be in Monday, and I'll be in all five days.  Next week.  Oh, wow. 
[00:32:00]  Wow.  Gee, thanks.  Five days in one week?  Boy, thanks for throwing us a bone.  I'm in town most of the month.  This is the only time I had to leave town was to do this gig.  Look, Jim, we're just like you.  I mean, our faithful listeners know Ant and I are probably the laziest guys in radio, although  we do put on a fine show.  You certainly do.  As soon as we build up enough material, we're taking that day off.  Sure.  Right now, we could take maybe an hour off, we figured.  An hour?  Tops.  So I guess XM isn't paying for your hotel if you're staying at a Best Western. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, it's awful where I'm staying.  It really is atrocious.  We were getting used to the nice hotel rooms, weren't we, Jimmy?  Yeah, I was getting kind of spoiled.  Yeah.  I called last night, I was like, they told me I had a Best Western, I'm like, ugh.  And of course, Voss talked to his girlfriend the whole way up, it was an awful ride up there.  What, making phone calls to his chick?  Yeah, he's just such a codependent slob.  Is he all pussy whipped now?  Oh, he's horrible.  Yeah, he kind of is.  Is he?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  He's one of those guys that when they get a girlfriend, that's it, you don't see him anymore.  He is totally that guy.  I hate that.  Voss used to call me every day, we'd play golf, this and that, and I haven't heard from  him in months.  Dude, every time the phone rang, those little non-dexterous fingers would just reach for  it, and he just had to talk and make sure everything was okay in the relationship.  Is everything fine, sweetie?  Does he do Voss baby talk?  Say, sweetie pie.  No, you hang up first.  I love you, sweetie. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, God.  Making little kissy faces with those rabbit teeth.  Bye, sweetie.  As he eats his phone accidentally, takes a big bite out of his Motorola.  Who's my little schmoopy, whoopy face?  I love you, too.  Suffer and suck a task.  Do I love you?  Okay, baby, I gotta leave. 
[00:34:00]  Exit, stage left, even.  That mess, Voss.  Ugh.  Oh, good.  Wow, that made me happy.  I'd love to run my fingers through your hair right now if I had human fingers.  Oh, but I love.  Yeah, we love, of course.  That muffins with cocktail wieners on the end of it.  I'm going to laugh at his stupid face when I see it later.  Next time you shake hands with Voss, feel it. 
[00:34:30]  It's all puffy.  It's like you shook hands with him and hit his hand too hard and an airbag went off.  Just a big puffy palm because the fingers aren't long enough to really distract from the palm.  Hey, we got to give Voss the call today.  Yeah, you should, man.  He's probably going to go to bed, but I know I'm getting up at like 3, so I imagine he'll be up.  Oh, you can't call me.  What am I talking about?  I'm acting like you can call him at 3.  Isn't this great that we made it through a week?  I think I finally synced up the sleep thing, and now it's a weekend, so I'm going to stay up late. 
[00:35:00]  I'm going to sleep late.  I'm going to screw the whole thing up again.  I've been up since yesterday.  I went over to the Cringe Humor Show.  I did a set there, and then we left.  I heard that went very well.  I heard you were very funny.  It was all right.  Yeah, it was cool.  I mean, I was so tired.  We just left, and we drove up here, and of course, it was just a miserable, awful ride,  so I'm just going to go to bed and sleep for a few days.  No hookers for little Jimmy tonight?  Dude, I didn't do anything last night.  No prostitutes, no nothing.  We stopped.  We ate in a diner, some bad food.  In the rest area, I bought an ice cream bar, just a little fatso trying to put something in my stomach. 
[00:35:30]  No phone sex, no cyber sex.  Dude, nothing.  I didn't get any emails that indicated that was possible, so I checked my email, and you and I talked at like 5-something.  You're sure you don't have a fever?  No, I feel okay.  I thought I was nauseous.  I was getting nauseous in the car.  Oh, we had stopped by a cop last night.  This XM car kit, which, of course, they forgot to send me.  They sent me two radios, two units of everything, and no car kit.  So I go, and I buy one on my own.  And we're on the way up, and I'm trying to install it, but I'm getting carsick, putting it in. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, you can't look down as the car is rolling.  Yeah, I'm horrendous.  So I tell Walsh to pull off, and he pulls off, and there's an awful little road off a sawmill.  And we're there, and a cop comes up, because there's two creeps in a business parking lot.  And I guess Walsh is trying to show off on the phone with his girlfriend, and the cop walks over.  And he's like, oh, can I see your license?  And Walsh is like, why do I have to show you my license?  Oh, my God.  What does he think?  He's black?  He really is awful.  He spent too much time in the tanning bed.  He's starting to think like that. 
[00:36:30]  Don't be such a...  Always confrontational with the police.  He's never been like that.  He's a worm with everybody.  And I'm like, what are you doing, dude?  And of course, the cop was finally okay with it.  But he ran a check on us.  It was just very unpleasant.  You know, I know why Voss would do something like that.  He probably thinks he's so famous now from Last Comic Standing that everyone's going to recognize him.  And the cop would go, oh, it's Rich Voss, and he's doing a bit with me.  Oh, don't put this in your act.  Not only did the cop not recognize him, but the cop came over to me. 
[00:37:00]  And after, he's like, where are you guys going?  So I tell him, Palace Theater, Albany.  Get a little plug.  I tell him that we're comedians.  And he didn't care.  He goes, all right.  He goes back to the car, and he comes out, and he gives us back our stuff.  So Voss goes, I'll bet you people at the station knew who I was.  Oh, because they called in his license.  And of course, they must have heard Rich Voss over the radio.  Yeah.  And the whole department rallied around his innocence.  Let him go.  What are you doing stopping that important man? 
[00:37:30]  He's a deluded sociopath, Voss.  Pat from Jersey is wondering if Voss thinks Hitler leans toward anti-Semitism.  I'm very good, though.  Well, my friend, we miss you today, Jimmy.  Yeah, I really hated not coming in, but I'll see you guys Monday.  We'll have a fine week.  All right.  Well, have a good show in Albany.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  Maybe we'll wake you up later. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  And people should know that they could get the Jim Norton CD on eatabullet.com.  Yes, for sale.  Never in stores, because they take too much money, and they object to certain stuff.  So I just saw them on the website.  Yeah, I could see Jimmy's CD in a Walmart or somewhere.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Could you just cover up this or that, or just take that out?  And it's like, ugh, why?  My next album's going to be Repulsive, too, so that should be us.  My next album.  Welcome to 1973.  And I suck dicks on the phone. 
[00:38:30]  It's recorded in hi-fi.  All right, Jimmy.  All right.  Later, folks.  Thank you.  There goes Norton.  Put his album on the old Victrola.  Voss.  That would be a real treat, having to drive with him just smoking every two seconds.  In his 1973 Mercedes, talks about his Mercedes like it's a brand-new Mercedes, all nice.  Dude, it's worse than that, because we went to Miami, and we played the Doral during the hiatus. 
[00:39:00]  And that's where I broke my hand in the sand trap that he abused me about.  But the guy, we rented a car.  He smokes and talks on the phone at the same time and drives.  With what?  And doesn't pay attention to any directions.  Is he a knee driver?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  It is the scary...  Like his elbow, kind of like this.  And it just must reek in there like cigarette smoke.  It's awful.  Absolutely awful.  All right, let's step aside.  I was going to play something from one of our CDs, but... 
[00:39:30]  But what?  Do we have time?  I don't know.  We're trying to make the breaks a little better.  I have no idea what the schedule of this program is.  I know what time I come in.  I know what time I leave.  Anything that transpires in between, not a clue.  The beauty is we don't have to play commercials.  Right.  That is a beauty.  Everyone else in commercial radio land, they're sitting through like a 20-minute commercial  break right now.  And we continue to talk.  So we could play this.  Sure.  All right, we put out a CD called Demented World.  The record company sucked. 
[00:40:00]  So not many people...  Well, actually, we sold about 100,000 copies of this thing.  Shyster from Restaurant Records, the label that it's on.  What a dick.  We used to do signings for this thing where there'd be thousands of people up in Massachusetts.  Thousands of people waiting online to buy the CD and have us sign it and hang out with  us and stuff.  And the shyster that ran this record company used to stand there by the table selling T-shirts  that he had printed up.  And posters.  Demented World T-shirts and posters. 
[00:40:30]  And he'd be in a corner at the end of the appearance counting off these dollar bills,  this huge stripper stack of dollar bills.  And he'd be peeling them off, counting them.  And we didn't see dime one out of that.  No, we made no money off this thing.  I think me and Opie had to split a quarter per disc or something like that.  Split between the two of us.  Yeah.  And he was making all kinds of money and he was still bitching.  And then the second we complained about the fact that we weren't getting any money and  he was selling all the T-shirts, he said, well, now that you're complaining on the air, 
[00:41:00]  I'm never going to pay you.  I'm not going to pay you.  This was after he didn't pay us.  He didn't pay us anyway.  For at least a year and a half before that.  But then he figured out a way to justify not paying us.  Right.  We've had a bunch of dicks in our lives.  It's one of those learning experiences that everyone has to go through, especially when  you put out a CD, if you're a band or anything.  You always get screwed, that first disc you put out.  The record company screws you, management screws you, and that was our learning experience,  Demented World.  We're very happy with it, very proud of it when it first came out, especially a few years 
[00:41:30]  ago, 10 years ago, whatever it was.  How old is that, man?  It's 1997.  Oh, my God.  So if Infinity's listening, we did this material before we came to your company.  That's why we can play this.  Did we do a Pearl Jam bit on it?  We're trying to drag up all the stuff we did before we went to Infinity Broadcasting.  Yeah.  Because the paper said it yesterday, they're holding our archives hostage.  Hostage.  They got the O&A archives.  Yeah, we can't play anything that we did. 
[00:42:00]  And they refused to release it to the boys.  So we could grab some earlier stuff.  We're trying to find some of the earlier stuff we did.  But actually, this CD's great.  Especially for people that are brand new to the O&A show, which there are a lot of here  on XM.  We want to kind of give you a little taste of where we came from.  The CD ends up on eBay every once in a while for like $100 a pop.  I know.  I found one up in upstate New York in Oneonta.  I was in Oneonta and went to a mall there.  And in the record store, there was a copy.  So I picked it up.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  So off our CD, The Men in World, to make these breaks a little better until we figure it out  in Washington.  Here's a track called Tourette's Whorehouse.  Oh, yes.  This is when you used to be able to do prank calls on the radio, matter of fact.  Yeah, the good old days.  Another thing you just can't do, even on satellite radio I hear.  Here's Tourette's Whorehouse.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  Hi.  The Nevada area, in about a week, I got your pleasure menu. 
[00:43:00]  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred.  Wow, that's pretty cheap. 
[00:43:30]  That's where the prices start, and then from there, the sky's the limit, because all the  ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy,  I could get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Oh, is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take... 
[00:44:30]  A mastercard?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's worth your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe? 
[00:45:00]  All of our ladies are very nice.  High up...  Jungle fever?  Do you have any...  Black girls?  We have black ladies, we have Asian ladies, we have Oriental ladies, it just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  Um, no, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay? 
[00:45:30]  But wait...  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony laboratory.  Hey guys, anyone want a bagel?  No!  Stop ruining the show, Eric. 
[00:46:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Feel the love.  Have you ever been in a serious social situation when you suddenly realize you have to pull  the underwear out of the crack in your ass?  You take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? 
[00:46:30]  Huh?  Who, her?  Oh, hell yeah.  Well, it's one of life's little moments, isn't it?  It's one of those little moments you have to deal with at the time. 
[00:47:00]  You've got to get in there and clear that thing out.  You've got to rescue your underwear.  There's a letter in your mailbox.  That's right.  You ever been in a really loud party?  I mean, a good loud party where the music is playing too loud and everybody is talking  too loudly? 
[00:47:30]  And in order to be heard, even by the person standing right next to you, you've got to be  screaming at the top of your lungs?  But every now and then at a party, it seems as though everyone shuts up at the same time.  And only your voice can be heard.  Right!  I know!  I know!  Well, what I'm going to do, I'm going to have my testicles laminated.  Life's little moments. 
[00:48:00]  You ever been talking to someone and you laugh through your nose and blow a snot on your shirt?  And you have to just kind of keep talking, you know, and make believe it's part of the  design. 
[00:48:30]  Works all right if you're wearing a Hawaiian shirt.  But otherwise, they're going to notice.  Hey!  You got a big snot on your shirt.  Some guys are really cruel, you know.  And some of these things are not even your fault.  These little things that happen, you didn't cause the situation.  A lot of times, you're the victim.  You walk into some situation and suddenly you're the one who's taken all the heat. 
[00:49:00]  Not your fault.  Give you an example of the kind of thing I mean.  Do you ever meet somebody and you go to shake the guy's hand and you suddenly realize he doesn't  have a complete hand?  And you got to make believe it feels great.  Right?  You can't go, ahhhh!  Ahhhh!  Ahhhh!  You can't do that. 
[00:49:30]  It's not even an option.  You're going to hang in there and say,  Hi!  Hey, swell hand!  Give me three!  Hi, three, yo!  Not your fault.  You didn't cause that.  You weren't even there when it happened to the guy. 
[00:50:00]  Six monkeys and a turd-throwing party.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello, hello, hello.  Not a police call, but it's all.  It's everything I wish I didn't know.  It's a joke.  Give me something.  I can see you, feel you, feel you, feel you. 
[00:50:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  High voltage, 202.  Spread the virus to your friends if you're enjoying what you're hearing, especially you  truckers, you're key to the spreading of the virus.  We're getting email from nothing but truckers so far, Anthony.  Yeah.  Instant feedback.  We got Kenny from Boston.  I'm a smoker, and pretty soon I'm going to have to hide in a closet under a blanket to have a cigarette. 
[00:51:00]  I'm sick of this country telling me what's good for me and what I can't do.  And what I can do, sorry.  It's only a matter of time before we become mindless robots.  And Chicago checking in, dead bent.  Opie, I want to shoot off my shotgun today.  Oh.  Get the rednecks shooting their guns.  I know they have nothing but miles of nothingness around them.  Who's going to care?  Me?  I want to wake my good-for-nothing neighbors up.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Yeah, we did that once.  Shootouts.  Yeah.  You've heard of the shout-out. 
[00:51:30]  We like doing the shootout.  Usually on those black radio stations.  What?  They have the shout-outs?  Yeah, you call up and, you know.  Urban, Opie.  It's called urban stations.  Black people don't mind being called black.  Really?  They just don't like being called colored.  Well, of course not.  That's derogatory.  Speaking of that, we have Earl making an appearance today.  Earl's coming in?  Yeah, he's actually up and away coming shot.  Black Earl making his appearance on the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:52:00]  I'm coming in, you know, and then we're going to go over to N.E.W.  And go to work.  He's going to get fired.  He thinks he's being set up, too, right?  Oh, he's like, you're setting me up.  I'm like, no, Earl, come on in, you know.  If you've ever seen the movie Office Space, Earl is like the guy with the stabler.  The stabler.  My stabler.  They pretty much fired Earl, but he comes into work anyway.  He comes into work.  He's so used to going over there to that station that he goes in every day and stays there for 
[00:52:30]  hours and hours.  He used to work 50 hours a week.  They cut him down to 10 hours a week.  He still goes in for 50 hours a week.  And they moved his, remember his cubicle was outside our old office?  Yeah.  And he had a lot of space back there.  By the window, he had a window in his cubicle.  They moved him to the old dump room.  Remember that little room where the guy with the dump button was?  That's just a closet.  It's a closet.  It's a glorified closet.  That's where he is now.  And he works for 10 hours, but he shows up for 50 hours a week. 
[00:53:00]  You know what's the best, too?  Because Hope and I will hang out with Earl.  Don't ever go to dinner with Earl, because don't expect that he's going to pay for a friggin'  thing.  Oh, I've never seen Earl pull a dollar out of his pocket.  But I feel bad for the guy.  He doesn't even make, like, minimum wage.  But no, he was working, like, 50 hours over there.  He'd been there forever.  He had to make some kind of money.  Those bathroom slaves make more money, Anthony.  Look at me with the segue, huh?  Nice segue.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Bathroom slaves.  Is this a regional thing, or is this across the country? 
[00:53:30]  Well, I guess we could at least...  I guess it's across the country and in some of the classier places.  Certainly in the big cities.  Yeah.  You don't get this happening at your local Denny's.  No.  You don't get the bathroom slave at Denny's.  Bathroom slave.  There's a huge story in the New York Post today basically saying that the bathroom slaves,  these are the people in the really nice restaurants in New York City and other cities, obviously.  You know when you have to go to the bathroom and you're having that nice meal and you go downstairs or what have you, 
[00:54:00]  and you walk in and you walk in and there's the bathroom slave with the gum and the tic-tacs and the mouthwash and the cologne and the...  Enough already.  And it's not about, I don't care.  You know, here's your dollar, here's your two dollars, but it's not a convenience.  No.  It is not a convenience.  It's almost extortion.  It's almost extortion.  Because you feel obligated, you feel like you have to, you're forced to give this guy a dollar, or you're the scumbag. 
[00:54:30]  You know?  If you just go in there, you take a leak, you want to just wash your hands and walk out, you're the scumbag.  You didn't tip him a buck for standing there and watching you take a whiz.  I know, first of all, I know how to wash my hands.  Secondly, I haven't had to have somebody in the bathroom with me to help me out since my diapers came off last week.  We don't need these guys.  But I don't know what they're, who started that one? 
[00:55:00]  Who came up with the brilliant idea of standing in a bathroom, handing the people, after they take a leak, a paper towel, and expecting them to give you money?  And that's the worst.  You're at the urinal, and you're taking your leak, and you hear the faucet go on, and he gets the little paper towel ready for you.  He's prepping it for you.  You ever try to put your hands under the water he turns on, and he pushes you away to check the temperature first?  Yeah.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, let me, more hot, more hot water.  I don't care if it's ice cold, boiling hot, get out of my way. 
[00:55:30]  I don't wash my hands, okay?  I'm down here, quick leak, I want to get back up to my booze.  You what?  Dude, the reality is...  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  You're going to tell me this.  Your penis is cleaner than most parts of your body.  No, no, no, stop it.  Without a doubt.  You have to wash your hands after you take a leak.  Sometimes.  No, all the time.  Sometimes.  Oh, my God, dude.  No, you have to do it every time.  People are obsessed with that whole thing. 
[00:56:00]  It's not a matter of how clean you feel your schlong is, it's you're touching your schlong.  So?  If you have contact with other people through shaking your hand, I'm sure they wouldn't be  appreciative of the fact that you just had it wrapped around a schlong.  Your schlong is the cleanest part of your body.  Your feet are dirtier.  And you're touching things in a public bathroom.  Almost everybody picks their nose.  You think that's cleaner?  Well, that's why...  Do you wash your hands after you pick your nose?  I use tissue.  I don't usually pick my nose.  See, I need this discussion with Norton, not you, because you're like a neat freak. 
[00:56:30]  Everything has to be perfect with you.  Washing your hands after you go to the bathroom also takes care of...  So you don't even cut your own bunghole?  No, I use toilet paper if I ever have to apply anything to the bung area.  You ever hit your armpits?  That's a dirtier place than your ball bag.  But then you're washing your hands after you take a leak, and that way it keeps your hands  kind of clean from other scratching and whatnot you might do during the day, so you're kind  of washing your hands throughout the day.  Look. 
[00:57:00]  And if you're eating...  I take a leak.  If I remember, sure, I'll wash my hands, but I'm not, like, obsessing about it.  It's not an obsessing thing.  It's you should wash after you take a leak.  Ant, what if you take a leak in the woods?  Then you can't wash your hands, but, I mean, you've got to wait until you're by a bathroom.  No, you forget about it.  What?  You take a leak in the woods, that's the last thing you're thinking about when you  get close to civilization again, that you need to wash your hands because you touched  your penis.  I'm not saying that you rush to wash your hands right after you take a leak in the woods. 
[00:57:30]  What I'm saying is, if you take a leak and there's a sink and soap nearby, you should  utilize that and wash your hands.  Sometimes, sure.  No, all the time.  Dude, the handles on the faucet are dirtier than your schlong.  What about the splashback from the urinal?  Now you're getting urine on your hand.  I'm a careful leaker.  No, there's always some form of splashback, even microscopic.  You're touching the flusher on there. 
[00:58:00]  Now some other guy that touched his schlong touched the flusher.  You touched the flusher.  Now you're back up eating your corn on the cob.  Yeah.  Tasting other man's junk.  Anthony, I'm setting this up so no one shakes my hand again.  Why do you think I got so sick this week?  Ah.  Oh.  I know the handshake.  This is an ulterior motive.  I've had people shake my hand or try to in the bathroom.  I guarantee I got so sick this week because of that promotion we did on Long Island with 
[00:58:30]  everyone shaking our hands.  There were some clammy, sweaty hands that came up to us.  And I washed my hands right after we go.  See?  When we go to go back to eat.  See that?  First stop, bathroom wash hands.  See, that I should have done.  Yeah.  Because I know where all my stuff has been.  Yeah, but other people don't want to touch your hand.  I'm going to say our fans' hands are dirtier than my penis.  You know something?  I don't know.  I guess so.  But I...  How about we invent something new for the Opie and Anthony show? 
[00:59:00]  We're very interactive.  We love hanging out with our listeners and getting hammered and showing you guys boobs  and just having a good old time.  Yeah.  Let's take the handshake out of the whole thing.  You want to do that?  You know, that whole fist thing I like.  Oh, the bang the knuckle together thing?  The bang the knuckle.  That's kind of cool.  Less contact.  You don't have to feel the sweatiness of the other person.  I don't mind shaking hands at an appearance or something.  Because I'm not really doing anything.  The two places I don't want hands shook, and people insist on doing this, is in the bathroom. 
[00:59:30]  I've been taking a leak at an appearance or a ball game or something like that, and people  go, hey, Anthony.  They zip their fly up and stick their hand out to shake.  And I don't care.  I go, I'm not shaking your hand.  It's a hand job by proxy.  I don't want...  The guy just had his member in his hand.  I'm not going to touch it.  Another time, no handshaking is when I'm eating.  I'm eating like a sandwich or something.  And someone will come up, hey, man, what's up?  And put their hand out.  And now I'll do the thing like, oh, my hands are all greasy from eating food. 
[01:00:00]  Hey, what's up?  And give them a wave.  But the truth of the matter is, I don't want to then shake your hand that I don't know  where it's been, wrap it around my sandwich now, and start eating whatever was in your  hand by proxy.  That's a blowjob by proxy.  I've known you for 10 years.  Yeah.  I'm starting to think you're a germaphobe.  I have no idea.  There is a fine...  I'm talking...  And I'm not talking one end of the spectrum or the other.  People that don't wash and people that can't stop washing their hands.  There's a middle ground called basic hygiene, where I just want to keep my hands as clean  and germ-free. 
[01:00:30]  Perhaps that's why I only get sick once every three years I get these colds.  And I'm sure it was from that goddamn Mohegan Sun chips.  There was some Arab guy that was sniffling like he had the SARS.  And the dealer's pulling his chips off of his pile and giving them to me.  Oh, did you say SARS?  Oh, oh, oh.  Nice segue.  If we had our staff up to speed, we would be able to play Brother Joe's SARS song right  now.  Well, they were out a little late last night, Opie.  Did you say SARS? 
[01:01:00]  Out a little late last night.  I love doing a radio show on delay.  Well, we'll get to the SARS song from Brother Joe in a minute or two here when the guys wake  up after they have their coffee.  Dan in Cleveland.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hey.  I'm glad to hear you guys back here in Cleveland.  Oh, cool.  You know, I couldn't agree with you more.  I mean, you know, you take a leak, it's not like you got shit hanging off your cock.  Oh, my God.  You know, there's too many people not washing their hands after they take leaks. 
[01:01:30]  Okay, it's an acceptable thing, all right?  What's your hand?  You know, you're out all night doing whatever.  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  I mean, come on.  It's not like you're sticking the other hand up your ass.  It's not a big deal to you because it's your dick, you idiot.  People don't want to touch your hand after it's had your dick in it.  Don't be talking like, hey, man, it's not like I got shit hanging off my dick.  It's your dick.  I don't want to touch your hand that has been touching your dick.  That's what it is.  Of course you don't care.  It's yours. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Thank you, Dad.  That's it.  Stinkfinger for everyone now.  If I could touch my own butthole, I'd be giving everyone a stinkfinger, but I'm incapable.  So you shouldn't be in shock.  I'm telling you, if we took a poll today.  Unfortunately, you're touching your poll and not washing.  Most guys don't wash afterwards.  That's why this whole bathroom slave attendant thing is ridiculous.  And sometimes they intimidate people into not washing.  Sometimes guys will take a leak and walk right out of the bathroom because they don't want to make eye contact with the guy that's shaking you down for a buck in the bathroom. 
[01:02:30]  It makes for dirtier people.  You know, that's why people are sick all the time.  I question their motives in there.  What other motives?  I know their motives is to a buck.  Why would you want to work in a men's bathroom?  You think they want it for the view?  I don't know, man.  Perhaps if girls were in there.  For the perks?  Every job has its perks.  Why don't they get some chicks in the men's bathroom?  Some hot girls that are handing this stuff out.  They would get tipped like strippers.  And then you could just turn around with your slung hanging out.  Hey, honey. 
[01:03:00]  How you doing?  That's a great idea.  I think there is a restaurant or bar in New York City that tried to do that and they got shut down.  Did they?  There's probably some more regulation.  Oh, yeah.  There's got to be some law on that.  Some stupid, unnecessary law.  Yeah, what are we going to do about this?  Turn around and say, hey, baby.  What are we going to do about this?  Let's go to Mark in Queens.  How much for you to wash my slung?  Hey, Mark.  What's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  You suck.  Thank you, my friend.  While I was on hold, I learned something. 
[01:03:30]  Opie prefers fisting.  What?  I didn't hear you.  Opie prefers fisting.  Fisting.  Oh, you like the fisting instead of the shaking?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, that could get a little messy.  Fisting.  That's funny, Mark.  The knuckle bump.  All right.  Thank you.  You got anything else, sir?  I went to this one restaurant with some friends out from London.  They came to the city and they went to the bathroom. 
[01:04:00]  They came running back, freaked out.  It was like, there's a guy just standing in there.  Oh, they don't have that in England?  Jolly good.  I tried explaining it to them.  They refused to go to the bathroom.  Should I wash your dick, sir?  A little soap for your testes, sir?  All right.  So the story in the post, we started this like 20 minutes ago.  The bathroom slaves.  Attendants got just $2 an hour at top eateries here in New York City.  How much do waitresses make? 
[01:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Who also work off of tips.  Hundreds.  They're working.  But they're working.  Yeah, they make like crappy money per hour.  Oh, yeah.  But they live off tips.  Same with these guys.  No, no, no.  Are these guys bitching that they're not being paid enough?  Is that what I'm gathering from this article?  Look, you know, if the only job you could get is to be a bathroom slave, maybe...  Yeah, perhaps you should have paid a little more attention in high school, first of all.  I don't really feel too sorry for you.  It says, talk about a job that stinks.  Bathroom attendants at some swank city eateries take home less than $2 an hour in tips after paying for the privilege to clean up after patrons and dispense mints. 
[01:05:00]  What's a state study found?  Anyone eat those mints?  You know, there's a company that...  Bathroom mints.  That's great.  That's what I want to be.  There's fecal matter floating around.  No, they're all wrapped.  Those are fine.  All right.  It's the mints after you eat sushi or at a Chinese restaurant.  Yeah, they're all wrapped.  But people have been putting their hands in there, grabbing them after not washing their hands and touching their schlongs.  So there's a company that sends all these people, the bathroom slaves, to all these restaurants? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Okay?  They don't do that on their own.  You know, there's a company that hires you and goes, okay, you're going to hang out at this toilet.  You know what the company's called here in New York?  Royal Flush.  Ho, ho.  You need a wacky horn.  Oh, yeah, a wacky horn.  I don't have my bell either here.  We don't have any of this stuff.  They took everything away from us and we're slowly building the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn.  Uh, the company does not pay an hourly wage and charges attendants 25 to 30 percent of their tips just to get in the bathroom door.  Well, sorry. 
[01:06:00]  So all the tips that we give these people?  Yeah.  Then the big boss comes in.  You give them a buck, they get a quarter.  Yeah.  The house gets a quarter.  Yeah, exactly.  There you go.  Well, they'd look pretty stupid standing out on a sidewalk with mints and towels waiting to dry your hands on a sidewalk.  They've got to pay the establishment.  That's where the bathroom is.  Felicia staffed the ladies' bathroom at Tavern on the Green for three years, typically working six days a week to bring home $1,000 a month.  Oh, $1,000 a month? 
[01:06:30]  I thought you were going to say a week.  Wake the F up.  $1,000 a month.  Time to get a new job.  Well, look at what you do.  It's time to get a new job, maybe an education.  Collect some cans on the side.  That's the next step down from this job.  I think you can make more money collecting cans.  Collecting cans.  $1,000 a month?  Do the math.  You can definitely make more collecting the cans.  This is the dumbest cause I've ever seen.  Wow, what's all that moaning?  Is that live?  Are we going to get the gay out of the studio finally?  I was hearing a chick moaning. 
[01:07:00]  What the hell was that?  Screw this story.  What the heck was that?  Remember that audio I was telling you about?  Yeah.  That's what it was.  Is Jaime liking it?  Yeah, Jaime really likes it.  I've got a crowd.  Holy shit, Steve.  Your mic is so loud.  Sorry.  Now it's loud again?  Alright, now it isn't.  Ben, when does the staff wake up?  7.30 maybe?  I don't know.  Eric's running on nothing.  Okay.  Well, he had to go to the comedy show last night.  That was real important.  Let's go to a comedy show on the first week of the radio show. 
[01:07:30]  What time did the comedy show let out?  Eric, what time did the comedy show let out?  What?  Look at him.  Huh?  What time did the comedy show let out?  Dude, he's totally out of it.  1 o'clock.  1 o'clock in the morning.  1 o'clock.  And then what time did you have to get up to come here?  What time did you have to get up to come here, Eric?  No, no, no.  I came here right from there.  He came right here from there.  Oh, my, he's shot.  He is shot.  But he went out to dinner with Big Kev here.  They went out for Chinese food somewhere downtown.  So what time?  So when was the last time he slept?  He doesn't sleep.  He's the lone man on the totem pole. 
[01:08:00]  He's making a great impression so far.  Speaking of which.  I mean, we love the gang at Cringe Humor, but we got more important things.  I would have loved to have gone to that show.  Dude, you know, I'm showing responsibility.  I would love to stay out all night and party.  Are you kidding me?  That's right.  I need a goddamn drink at this point.  I did an opie.  It's been a week of stress.  Well, I did an opie.  I took my five to seven nap last night.  I thought you touched your dick without washing your hands.  I got up at seven o'clock.  Remember we were having this discussion yesterday, who would be the first one to oversleep?  I got up at seven o'clock last night. 
[01:08:30]  I thought, holy shit, it's seven o'clock in the morning.  And for five minutes, I was frantically running around.  You thought you overslept.  Yeah.  And you were 12 hours early.  Yeah, that is the weirdest feeling.  I have no clue what time it is, when I'm sleeping, awake, I look out the window, I don't know, even if it's dark, light, I have no clue.  This is the weirdest lifestyle.  But every day, it gets more gooder.  More gooder.  I think by Monday, we're all going to be in sync, by the way.  The cold's going to be gone.  The sleep pattern's going to be a little better.  Yeah.  We're going to have a little alcohol in us by then. 
[01:09:00]  Ah!  It's so hard to drink at this hour, but that's what Bloody Marys are for.  That's right.  Now, instead of drinking beer, like we did in the afternoon in Jägermeister, we could just mix up some bloodies.  All right.  Angry Tim, what's up, buddy?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  You cut me off yesterday.  What happened?  He is angry.  What?  What'd you try to say?  I was talking about Howard Stern and Robin.  No, you were, you know what, dude?  No, because you were, ah.  What you had to say was just stupid.  Oh, come on, man.  I mean, you know, we have our problems with Howard, but we try to keep it a little, uh, a little bit clever. 
[01:09:30]  Maybe keep it a little funny.  You know, you're just, you were just being racist to be racist, which is just stupid.  It really is.  Listen, uh, did you know that he's doing that Guess What's In My Pants gig?  All right.  Well, yeah, we heard tell.  I'm sure we do it a little better.  I'm sure we do a lot of things better.  Yeah, of course.  And only time will tell on that one, so.  I mean, what a hypocrite, you know?  Like, you're stealing your stuff. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  Okay.  Thank you, Angry Tim.  Thank you.  Jeez.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Had nothing there.  Yeah, there's a way to fight your battles.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  We need to regroup here.  I need to, uh, eat the rest of my beagle.  Oh, it's, uh, uh, I didn't tell you guys, but it's, um, show and tell day on the Opie  and Anthony show.  I brought in a little something for everybody.  Show and tell?  A little show and tell.  I remember that in school.  Maybe we'll- 
[01:10:30]  It was a little tater tot.  Maybe we'll break that out next.  Okay.  We're attempting to get the gay out of the studio.  I think Steve might have, uh, accomplished that.  Steve is like, look at him in there.  I know.  He's all worked up and excited.  He's all flushed.  I think he has a boner.  I do.  You should, you should listen to this audio.  Just, you know, in break, take a listen to it because it is the most unbelievable-  Jaime, are you giving it the thumbs up?  Thumbs up?  You-  Oh.  He wants to know if you like the audio.  Oh, hell yeah.  All right.  We love Jaime, man.  I said Jaime, not Heiney. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  We should take a break.  But before we go to break, because we're making the breaks a little better because we're  playing stuff right here in New York.  More gooder.  Because we really can't trust the gang in Washington yet because they're just obsessed with George  Carlin for some reason.  We were talking about the bathroom crap and, you know, you know, catching crap.  Yeah.  Brother Joe came in and debuted his SARS song yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show.  A little ditty about SARS.  Check it out.  Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! 
[01:11:30]  Oh-ho!  Sick with the SARS  I cough and I wheeze  That incurable illness  Thank the Chinese for SARS  Oh-ho-ho-ho!  Infected with SARS  I caught them in vain  I must have caught it 
[01:12:00]  From that chick on the plane  With SARS  Sickened by SARS  And it really shows  My right lung exploded  And blew out of my nose 
[01:12:30]  It's SARS  Chinese gave me SARS  I am very sick  But I'm not like them  With their really small height  And SARS  Do you have an Audi belly button?  Do you have an Audi belly button?  Do you have an Audi belly button? 
[01:13:00]  Do you ever eat an entire chocolate cake?  Um...  Yeah, this is Willie. Can I help you?  Yes, um...  I got a letter in the mail  And I want to be taken off the membership list  What are you trying to say?  I don't want to be on...  I was signed up for it  When I didn't sign up for it

If you blow up my pussy  I'm gonna bludgeon you  Ow, stop, relax  I'm just screwing around  Ow  Oh my god  I'm so sorry  The O.B. and Anthony Show  That's Korn 
[01:17:00]  That's a great version of that song  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show  We like to call it the O.A. virus  Spreading slowly but surely across America  Exactly  It's the brand new O.B. and Anthony Show  On XM satellite radio 
[01:17:30]  Getting more gooder every day  Tell your friends  O.B. um  Chris from Boston  Saying, hey Ant  What about the people who wash their hands  In the bathroom, of course  And then touch the  SIF ridden door handles  With the hand they just washed  Well  I have an answer to that too  Here it comes  What you gotta do is  You gotta wash your hands  And then get the paper towels  And use the paper towels  After you dry your hand  To shut the water off  And open the door  Then you hold it with your foot 
[01:18:00]  Roll up the paper towel  And go for the shot  Into the garbage  And then you walk out  With your hands nice and clean  Without having to  Have touched handles and stuff  And you do this every time  Yeah  I'm telling you man  Your penis is cleaner  When you're in the restaurant  Someone goes  Did you enjoy your meal  Let's say it's the hostess  Or whatever  And they shake your hand  Or whatever  And then you open the door  Out of the restaurant  Yeah  That's dirtier than your own junk man  It's the same thing 
[01:18:30]  No it's not  And you're just talking  You're talking from  That means you should be  Cleaning your hands  Literally like 20 times a day  No now that's crazy  We're touching this counter  This counter I'm telling you  Is dirtier than my junk  No it isn't  Of course it is  But it's junk  It's junk  It's male genitalia  That's something you don't want  To be touching  Perhaps technically  It's cleaner  If you took a lab swab  And did all testing  I don't know about you  But I touch my junk  All the time 
[01:19:00]  Wonderful  All the effing time  There's a way to get  In and out of the bathroom  Clean your hands  And get back to what you were doing  Without having touched everything  Too many things you have to do though  Too many steps involved  So do you wash your hands  Before you go to the bathroom?  No  So maybe you can get  The bathroom slave  To wash your dick afterwards  That's what I'm saying  They should have the girls in there  So they can give you that 
[01:19:30]  Little rub with some soap  Because then your dick's got to be dirty  Let's say hi to Nebraska  Todd, what's up, buddy?  Hey, how's it going, you guys?

Either Tuesday or Wednesday  He's going to make his first appearance  On the new Opie and Anthony show  Next week  Cool  He's got a DVD out  Called Live at the El Rey 
[01:23:00]  Mmm  And he thanks us on the DVD, Anthony  How about that?  And he quotes me  Using my real name  Greg Hughes, a.k.a. Opie of the Opie and Anthony show  Doesn't say Greg Opie Hughes  On WNEW Radio  As told to the New York Times  I said  Stephen Lynch, he's radio gold  When you do a show like ours  To have someone like him is a rarity  Ooh  You want to hear one of his songs?  Nice quote  We could sag into one of his songs real fast  Sure  But we'll come back  We won't take a break  Unless we're  Are we running late on break, Steve? 
[01:23:30]  No, we're good  We're good  And we're going to get the gay out, right?  Oh, yeah  Are you almost ready with that?  Oh, it's ready  Ooh  Nice  Should we spread out all this delicious radio?  Or should we  All this scrumpidly-ish radio?  If you want to take a quick four minutes  Or should we just pile it on?  Mmm  Like a big tray  You slide down the cafeteria  They just  Ladle on a bunch of crap on the plate  Or do you pick at it?  One at a time  If we pile it on  Then everyone's going to expect this every day  Oh, no  Should we just spread it out slowly? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, we should spread it out a little  All right, yeah  Coming up, though  We're going to get the gay out  And there's gay people calling us  Listen  We don't mind the gay  Trust me  What happened, though  We started this new show at XM Satellite Radio  And there was a major gay overtone  And we're all about variety here  Yes  We'll get dirty  We'll make you think  We'll make you laugh  We'll make you think dirty  We'll make you cry at times  We like to balance everything out  Make you cry  We're just like bridges of Madison County 
[01:24:30]  That's right  We are Clint Eastwood topless  As he's taking a shower  That was the downfall of Clint right there, man  Right there  With his bologna tits  Washing up by the well  And what's her name?  It's Meryl Streep, right?  Meryl Streep is looking out the window  Dude, I got it  At this ancient Clint  Washing his body  That looks like it's got doilies  Hanging off of it  And she starts touching herself 
[01:25:00]  That was the last chick flick  I've ever gone to  That was the last one  Well, you saw it in the movies  Yeah  You had to go  It was one of those obligations  A guy has to go to the chick flick  With his chick  I'm willing to admit it  I was a pussy  Early on in any relationship  Every guy is a pussy  They will do things  That down the road  They're not going to do  Last chick flick I went to  Was  What was that one called?  Love Letter  Who was in that one?  I don't even know  I can't remember  Oh, it was awful  Was that another Tom Hanks movie 
[01:25:30]  With stupid Meg Ryan?  No  Tom Selleck  Tom Selleck was in it  How do you know, Steve?  It's on HBO every five minutes  Is it?  What an awful chick flick  Horrible movie  And that was when I was still married  So, you know  I felt like I had to go  Ugh  And I did  Didn't save me any money  Bridges of Madison County  I just sat there with all the other guys  All the other wimps  And we all had our arms folded  Like this is the biggest piece of crap movie  I've ever seen in my life  They ought to just open up a bar  Who's believing that Clint Eastwood is hot 
[01:26:00]  With his bologna tits  As he's showering off outside  And Meryl Streep is getting all wet inside  Taking a peek  From the second story window  Can I put my film in your refrigerator?  Ugh  I'm here shooting the bridges of Madison County  Oh  Oh, God  He was shooting punks and thugs  In the other movies  In the cool movies  What happened to the good, the bad, the ugly?  Ugh  The bad chick flick  The old Clint Eastwood would have shot her  Exactly 
[01:26:30]  Whore  That was horrible  Anyway, our friends  Chick flick  They ought to just open up a bar area  In movie theaters  When chick flicks are playing  So the guys can just step up  And talk about things  And have a few wobbly pops  Or something  You don't have to sit there  Like you want to go to this movie  Women have this image  Of these guys that they're with  That actually  They have this impression in their head  That they want to be there  Sitting, watching this movie  And ladies  It has nothing to do with your company 
[01:27:00]  You know, I'm not saying  They don't want to be with you, perhaps  I'm sure some of them, they don't  But at these chick flicks  It's not a personal thing with you  It's the movie  They stink  They suck  And we don't want to sit there  And watch this drivel  But if you don't go  And you go  No, I don't want to go  You don't take me anywhere  You don't want to share interest with  Shut up  There should be a door  To the right of the screen  Yeah  And the guys go  You know, up to the screen  Through the door  And there should be a strip club  Right behind the screen  There you go  There you go  Just like that Jersey girl movie 
[01:27:30]  Kevin Smith's movie  Oh, that was a brilliant movie  I want to see people smoking pot  And playing hockey on rooftops  Kevin Smith is calling in  To say hi today, right?  Big Kev?  Nine o'clock  A close personal friend of Big Kev  Big Kev was actually in Jersey girl  I was  For about a half a second, was it?  It's about to be a full second  A full second  A full second?  Nice  Ben Affleck pushes you out of the way?  That's true  How about that? 
[01:28:00]  I didn't know we were hanging out with greatness today  Couldn't be in, you know, Dogma  I couldn't be in one of the classics  I couldn't be in Clerks  Couldn't be in Clerks  You know, picking out a video or something in the background  Yeah!  You had to be the guy that gets pushed out of the way  In the worst movie ever made  I wasn't in Bridges of Madison County  Couldn't be in the flying car  Alright, so Stephen Lynch has this new DVD out  He's coming in next week  We're really excited  He's got new songs and all that  Any bowling tunes on that? 
[01:28:30]  No, he blew off the bowling song  He did?  Yeah, but I mean this DVD is great  There's a lot of Stephen Lynch classics  And a lot of new material  Here's a song when I was just kind of  Quantum leaping all over the country  Yes  At one point I started following Stephen Lynch on tour  Stalking him?  I caught up with him in LA  And then at House of Blues on Sunset  And then he's like  Did you ever hear Burning Down the House of Blues  By George Carlin? 
[01:29:00]  It's a great bit  We ought to play it  To everyone that just turned on their XM satellite radios  They're not getting it  But everyone else did  Screw him  So I catch up with him at the House of Blues  And then he's like  Dude, we're going to Vegas  Why'd you come?  So I did the road trip to Vegas  Nice  Did the tour with Lynch  And he's got a new song called  Craig?  Yeah  I want to play it off his new DVD  Live at the El Rey  Okay?  It's a little noisy  There's a little noise in the background  So don't be bitching about it 
[01:29:30]  When the music kicks in  You won't even hear it  So shut up  It'll be just fine  Here's Stephen Lynch  Craig  So I was plumbing through my Bible recently  As I want to do  And I came across a passage  About a guy in the Bible  I had never heard of before  And I was intrigued by this  In all my years and years of Bible study  I had never come across this gentleman  And he seemed to me  Relatively unknown to the public at large 
[01:30:00]  And I thought  This is a guy I could write a song about  Because not only is he kind of unknown  But he was kind of relatable in a way  He really was  He was like an everyman  He was the kind of guy  You would hang out with  In everyday life  So I wanted to write a song about him  And the best part is that  He's related to someone else in the Bible  So you can kind of put him  Into context a little bit  So we're going to try out this song  For you tonight  It goes like this  Everyone knows Jesus 
[01:30:30]  The guy who healed the lame  Well I am Jesus' brother  Craig is my name  Jesus is the prince of peace 
[01:31:00]  Jesus is the lamb  Jesus is the son of God  But Craig don't give a damn  Because when Craig's inside  We'll party all damn night  I don't turn water into wine  But into cold coer's light  I'm not my brother  I know  Don't walk on H2O  But I got hydroponic shit  That me and Judas Crow  I'm fucking Craig  Yeah I'm fucking Craig 
[01:31:30]  Yeah I'm fucking Craig  Great Christ  I hang out with Mephers  Barabbas and Salome  Jesus' friends are called apostles 
[01:32:00]  Those dudes are totally gay  Jesus performs miracles  From Galilee to Rome  But it would be a miracle  If he brought a fucking lady home  Because while Jesus is praying  Fucking Craig is laying  Every lady in the testament 
[01:32:30]  You know what I'm saying  I won't die for your sin  Like my famous kin  But if you got a little sister  Then there's room at this inn  I'm fucking Craig  Yeah I'm fucking Craig  I can't Craig  Craig cries  Jesus was our mother's fave  All her love to him she gave 
[01:33:00]  But there's no sibling rivalry  When he's nailed to that tree  And now the question for you  Is not what would Jesus do  But where will you be  When the Craig machine  Comes partying through  And if the Lord will allow  You've got to ask yourself how  And who and why and when  And where is my Messiah now  It's fucking Craig  It's fucking Craig  Fucking Craig 
[01:33:30]  Fucking Craig  Great Christ  Great Christ  Great Christ  I'm fucking Craig  The Opie and Anthony Show  Socks first  Then shoes  The Opie and Anthony Show 
[01:34:00]  And here  As long as we're talking about  Theme restaurants  I got a proposition for you  I think  If white people  Are going to burn down  Black churches  Then black people  Ought to burn down  The House of Blues  Huh?  What a fucking disgrace  That place is  The House of Blues  They ought to call it  The House of Lame  White Motherfuckers  Inauthentic  Low frequency  Single digit  Lame  White Motherfuckers  Especially these 
[01:34:30]  Male movie stars  Who think  They're blues artists  You ever see these guys?  Don't you just want to puke in your soup  With one of these  Fat, balding  Overweight, overaged  Out of shape  Middle aged male movie stars  With sunglasses  Jumps on stage  And starts blowing into a harmonica  It's a fucking sacrilege  In the first place  White people  Got no business  Playing the blues  Ever  At all  Under any circumstances  Ever  Ever  Ever  What the fuck  Do white people 
[01:35:00]  Have to be blue about  Banana Republic  Ran out of khakis  Huh?  The espresso machine  Is jammed  Hootie and the blowfish  Are breaking up  Shit  White people  Ought to understand  Their job  Is to give  People the blues  Not to get them  And certainly not to sing  Or play them  Tell you a little secret  About the blues  It's not enough to know  Which notes to play 
[01:35:30]  You gotta know  Why they need to be played  And another thing  I don't think  White people  Should be trying to  Dance like blacks  Stop that  Stick to your  Faggoty polkas  And waltzes  And that repulsive  Country line dancing  Shit that you do  And be yourself  Be proud  Be white  Be lame  And get the fuck  Off the dance floor  Now  I thank you 
[01:36:00]  Hi this is Tom Torbjornson  With America's Car Show  Tip of the day  On XM Radio  Wayne from Fort Wayne  Indiana writes  I own an 87 Ford Mustang  GT  I'm wondering why  The oil pressure gauge  Constantly registers low  Will this have a negative  Effect on my vehicle's  Performance  Wayne  Will low pressure  Have a negative  Effect on your  Engine performance  Well yeah  And that the engine  Could seize up  And stop running  Never to run again 
[01:36:30]  Is that negative  Enough for you  Have an oil pressure  Test performed  With a mechanical gauge  To determine if the  Engine indeed has  Low oil pressure  Or if it's just  Due to a bad  Oil pressure sensor  Or wiring harness  To it  If you do have  Low oil pressure  You could do  Major damage  To the engine  In the form of  Rod or main bearing  Damage  Crank or cam damage  Cylinder wall damage  Or damage to anything else  That needs lubrication  Got a question?

[01:47:30]  To a country club  For what  Three or four months  Five months maybe  Yeah  No I think it's like  Three months  It's like three months  In a  It's not a prison  This isn't Oz  She's going to  She's not going to have  Schillinger tattooing  A swastika on her ass  And then banging her  You know  This is one of those  Country clubs  They go there  She's probably going to  And I know it's going to happen  She's going to be in charge  Of some kind of class  On  On  Cooking  And  Putting together  Baskets with flowers  And  She'll get time off 
[01:48:00]  For good behavior  Because of that  And she'll probably serve  A month and a half  Of her time  Because she's such a good  Human being  Just shut up  And take her  Take your punishment  It's not like she's going in there  For 20 years  A hard time  In the weight room  You know what  You gotta love Spike TV  Though man  One of my favorite channels  On TV  Spoik  Spike TV tribute  Chicks in chains  Oh  In honor of  Martha Stewart's  First night in prison  Spike TV is broadcast  Casting a marathon  Of Babes Behind Bars

[01:49:00]  Teeming  I thought it even got better  For a second  I still got the cold  I'm sorry  I'll be able to read  Much clearer on Monday  Teen girl prison movie  Because I read good  Sent to a prison  Teeming with sadism  Racial divisions  And drugs  Nice  What kind of prison is that?  They always have  The evil warden  They have the evil warden  And then they have  The older seasoned vet woman  That's in there  That takes one under her wing  And then the woman warden 
[01:49:30]  Is always the biggest bitch  In the whole movie  Well the best is  Usually sets up  With the other prisoners  To jump on the innocent girl  And beat her up  Who of course  Is wrongly accused  Because they gotta be  The purely innocent  Innocent girl  Of course  Love it  Of course  Chained Heat  And then if they're lucky  They get to go  To the warden's plantation  And do some work  Around the warden's plantation  What year is this?  But they have to dress  In their wife beater  T-shirts  With no bras  Nice  Nice  And then they have to  Do little things

We warn you guys  before we test  the limits  of the satellite radio. 
[02:09:00]  That's today's test.  One a day, I think.  And VirusJunk says,  Yo B,  it sounds like someone  was throwing a tray  up in that.  In that piece.  Up in that piece.  Marilyn, check it in.  More drills, more gooder.  All right, and then  some sex bagel abuse.  We don't need that right now.  Okay.  All right, why don't  we take another break?  Nice, the drill dough.  We're playing some tracks  from Demented World,  a CD we did before  Infinity Broadcasting,  so we're allowed  to play this stuff.  Sure.  As we slowly but surely  get our show back 
[02:09:30]  to where it used to be.  Mm-hmm.  And people are requesting  tracks from Demented World  today, which is pretty cool.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of  truckers out there  that have never heard  our Demented World CD.  Right.  Can't really get it anywhere  because the record company  really effed up on this one.  You know, why make a lot  of copies of a CD  that a very popular  radio show did?  Sure.  Why bother?  We still sold about  100,000 copies,  but it goes with  what we just did.  Remember the bit,  Hi, Mom, I'm in porno? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Love this one.  Basically, from Mother's Day,  when you used to be able  to do prank calls  on the radio,  can't do it anymore.  The FCC has cracked down  on that one, too, Anthony.  Yeah, too much fun.  We had daughters  calling their moms at work  and playing little games,  and this game was called  Hi, Mom, I'm in porno.  Hi, AF.  Who's this?  Michelle.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play  Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right.  I hear you want to play  Hi, Mom, I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Awesome.  Now, where does your mom live? 
[02:10:30]  Montana.  Well, what are you doing  in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny?  Cool.  Maybe you could tell your mom  you lost your job as a nanny  and you had to make ends meet,  so you jumped into porno.  Okay.  All right, I got your mom's number.  I'm giving her the call  right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi, can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay, hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job,  you had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  I have a problem. 
[02:11:00]  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fell apart.  I'm having a really hard time,  so I didn't tell you sooner  because I was too scared to,  but now I got a different job,  but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies?  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  What?  It's too late. 
[02:11:30]  No.  Mom?  No.  Um, I'll...  You, hold on.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have,  I have, like,  three days to get out of here,  so I don't...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank? 
[02:12:00]  Well, yeah,  but I kind of had to use some of it  to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent and...  No, you don't.  Where, where can I call you?  The same number,  but, Mom...  What?  There's something else  I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know  that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know,  I think those things  are so funny  when they happen 
[02:12:30]  to other people.  I mean,  I would sit and listen  to them all day long  because they're so funny,  but that...  You killed me.  Oh, my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really nice people.  Okay, I am going to kill you.  I love you.  Wait, wait, wait, Mom.  Mom, first kill us.  It's Opie and Anthony  from AF Radio in Boston.  Tell you guys.  We put her up to it.  I got to admit, man,  my heart sunk  to my damn knee cast.  Oh, my God.  I felt so bad for you.  I'm breaking out  in a sweat here. 
[02:13:00]  I'm thinking  that it's too bad.  Happy Mother's Day.  Well, thank you.  All right.  You can never really  find a good sound effect  of a guy getting  hit in the head  with a shovel.

I'll back a truck  through the fucking  two-family house garage. 
[02:14:00]  One of those  big two-ton trucks.  When was the last time  you drove a truck to trailer?  Oh, jeez,  what the fuck?  I'd say about two weeks ago  I robbed one  down in Jersey  and I drove it up here  to New York.  Fucking flying.  Drove it through the tolls,  no stopping,  no nothing.  I'm good.  I see.  Why don't you call  back on Monday?  Hey, I'll tell you what.  I come in,  I'll take you for a test spin.  How's that?  We go out  and we take the truck  around the fucking block.

Oh, jeez,  I worked for Moish,  I worked for Mayflower,  you know?  Oh, yeah,  don't sh-  Hey, I was good with them, too.  You worked with Moishers?  Yeah, that's right.  When?  About, what,  two years ago?  See, when I got a problem there,  they get fucking scared  when I pop the wheelies  and all that shit.  You know,  I pop a lot of wheelies.  I'm good with that shit. 
[02:15:00]  You know,  I don't break no merchandise.  See, I get it there  two hours ahead of time,  all the time.  What do you say?  Say,  if you pop any wheelies there,  I'm not even going to  put in your position.  Listen to me,  I don't break nothing,  sizzle chest.  I'm good.  Okay,  call Monday,  we'll set up an interview.

[02:16:30]  Shut your mouth!  I said shut your fucking mouth!  I masturbated so hard,  I almost broke my vagina.  Ha ha.  Fomp.  The O.P.  The Anthony Show.  You're checking out 
[02:17:00]  the O.N.A. virus  spreading across America,  getting more gooder  every day.  Much more gooder.  Show got really dirty there.  Really, really dirty.  Kind of cool, right, Anthony?  That was fun.  Let's go to Phil in Toronto.  What's up, Phil?  Hey!  I just wanted to let you know  you're coming through  loud and clear up in Canada.  Phil?  Phil?  Yeah?  You got your radio turned on? 
[02:17:30]  I do.  Oh, right on, man.  Thank you.  In Canada.  See?  Yes.  We're international, Opie.  Well, we were heard in Toronto  through a Buffalo radio station  when we were syndicated,  and they were all bummed.  They didn't think they could get  their XM Satellite radio,  so what they're doing is  they're going into Buffalo,  grabbing the radios,  and then going back up to Canada.  Yeah, because you still get it over there.  I do believe that's possible,  unless Jaime's going to say no to that one.  No, you can't cut the signal off  right at the border.  Very good.  Yeah.  Let's go to South Carolina.  Say hi to George.  What's up, George?

I had to stop by the visitor center  to freaking do a knuckle shuffle  on my piss pump.  Oh, man.  That was great.  I'm grateful that you guys are back.  I'm from Brooklyn, New York.  I'm currently stationed down here  in South Carolina.  I even got a couple of tenants out here  listening to you guys as well.  Nice. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  Well, just spread the virus for us,  all right?  I'm ready.  One other thing.  They should bring back  Psycho Mark sightings.  Yeah, we'll get Psycho Mark  back on the show eventually.  We're slowly building back  to where we were.  All right, George.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jeff in Boston.  We haven't said hi to Boston today.  Jeff, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Go Sox.  Go Sox.  That's right.  Four o'clock.  Four o'clock.  Four o'clock. 
[02:19:00]  I'm going to be wicked cocked  by game time.  All right, fellas.  I've been calling  in the past couple days  kind of keeping you up  on the Stern stuff  when the show first started  he was talking about  hey I'm going to revolutionize  satellite radio  I went with Sirius I think it's the better company  unlike some other people  and that guy Artie said who won't be an Anthony  and they started laughing  Sirius is not the better company  maybe he can make it  more gooder I don't know 
[02:19:30]  but it's not the better company  no you'd have to be silly to think that  silly  alright well thank you Jeff  alright fellas be good  we're doing satellite radio now  so how are you revolutionizing it  how are you the pioneer  if we're already doing it  it's not like we were a little local show  we got international attention  from our radio show way before the Sex for Sam thing  by the way  we were syndicated in I don't know 20 big markets  our stuff was spread 
[02:20:00]  all over the internet for years  I think people know who Opie and Anthony are  and you know there's no changing the fact  that we got to satellite radio first  oh it's just gotta bug him  it's gotta kill him  it's killing him  he's playing 20 minute commercial breaks  and we got girls getting plowed by drills  you make the choice  I'm a whore  it's either  I'm a whore  or Robin  dial a mattress  Bush wants me off the air 
[02:20:30]  yeah sure he does  forget about Iraq  Robin  or Osama Bin Laden  I am the president's biggest problem  of course you are  concentrating all his energy on me  getting me off the air  is what he's doing  poof  poof  because you're going to make the difference in the election  shut up  I can make a difference in the election  I don't want Bush being elected  so my minion  will keep him  out of office Robin  and I'll be on satellite radio  in what  2010  when am I going  yeah  when is it  Viacom  holding me to my contract 
[02:21:00]  I think he's going to be about 55 years old  when he goes to satellite radio  have fun  yeah like Bush is more concerned  about Howard  than Osama Bin Laden  that's right  I'm glad you said it  what an egomaniac  wake the F up  he's sending marines  to the studio  to capture me  I'm like in a cave  in Tora Bora  Robin  I'm going to have to broadcast  from a cave  as they bomb me  poof  he thinks I'm an insurgent  poof  what an idiot 
[02:21:30]  I don't think Bush is  really thinking that  could you see Bush  in some secret meetings  going  forget about Iraq  and North Korea  and Afghanistan  and Bin Laden  it's that Howard  that's what we got to take care of  paranoid  no one is that big  paranoid delusions  in this country  no one  no one  thinks there's some  X-Files like conspiracy  that's right  trying to get me Robin  they're saying if Bush doesn't  uh  uh 
[02:22:00]  track me when I go out  to the Hamptons  they put a bumper beeper on  and I see helicopters  chasing me around  black helicopters  Robin  poof  now I gotta go back  get the cocaine  bring it back to the house  cut it up  and my brother's gotta  stir the sauce  and there was helicopters  chasing me  what'd you do with the cocaine  put it in the toilet  I needed that  what are we gonna do  he's now playing our game  by the way  we got him to talk about us  what an idiot  he is the stupidest 
[02:22:30]  radio broadcaster  out there right now  we love commercials  for the Opie and Anthony show  on nationally syndicated  radio programs  yeah  your hero is stupid  okay  we've been nudging him  nudging him  superman  picking at him  and he's mentioning  our names now  that's the best thing  that could happen  to us right now  okay  he's broadcasting  to close to 12 million people  mentioning Opie and Anthony  boy we're so bummed out  that he's doing that  right now  we have an audience  the size of  a big college radio station 
[02:23:00]  is it a big college radio station  now it's a big college radio station  nice  but growing every day  okay  growing every day  the first thing you learn  in radio  is never talk about  guys below you  as far as  you know  the amount of people  you're talking to  you just don't do that  because you know  don't think you're pompous  enough to think  you're going to talk bad about us  and everyone's going to go  yeah you're right Howard  I'm not listening to them ever  you know how many people  you're going to turn on  to our show  by talking about us  you jerk  he did a commercial for us  said who we were  and where we're broadcasting from  right  thank you  thank you  thank you 
[02:23:30]  on it had to piss him off  that we were connected  to every single article  yesterday  every single newspaper  in America  had Opie and Anthony  XM satellite radio  yeah  oops how did that happen  thank you  and then you're trying  to tell everyone  you're the first  to go to satellite radio  wrong  I'm a pioneer  wagon's hoe Robin  and we weren't forced  to satellite radio  we chose this  everyone knows that  we were never fired  and we could have  went back to commercial radio  but we knew  it wasn't the place to be  pioneer  circle the wagon  people are laughing at you  yeah I'm the first  really  even the newspaper columnist 
[02:24:00]  all over America  saying well not really Howard  there's another show  called Opie and Anthony  that is already doing it  already did it  so keep talking about us  not quite the big crossover  who  who  who  who  who  Eric wants to say  hi in Virginia  Virginia  old Virginia  I gotta get this  freaking  Clem out of me  Eric what's up  hey man  I put  I ordered you guys in  because of the hype  that Exxon was putting in 
[02:24:30]  yeah  and I'll put it this way  Stern might be coming in  in  in 2006  but you guys are gonna  crown yourselves a king  of all media  before he  before he shows up  I don't want that crown  yeah we don't want that  we don't want to be  we don't want to be  ripping him off  no we ain't ripping him off  we're dethroning him  just  I'll put it this way  I've never heard  anything like this  on any of the programs  I mean I've listened to  you know the guys  out of Charlotte  guys out of Indianapolis 
[02:25:00]  Charlotte  you know his nemesis  out of Chicago  and  I swear  no wonder he's afraid  of you guys  alright  well he definitely  was afraid of us  it's a fact  he put a gag order  on us when we worked  for the same company  the company protected him  and you know what  the company can't  protect him anymore  you know  the company can't  force us not to  broadcast anymore  we were silenced  for two years  they fucked up our show  they took everything  away from us  they stripped us clean 
[02:25:30]  and now we have to  rebuild from here  hot  and we're gonna do that  we're up for the challenge  hey Joe  what's going on  hey how you doing  hey  yeah  I wanted to  tell Howard Stern  that he should get ready  for the same shock  and disappointment  that his daughter  went through  when she couldn't  complete her task  hmm  hmm  I don't know that one  I have lots of stories  but I don't know that one yet  I don't know that one either  hmm  well whatever  alright  so uh  what do we got going on 
[02:26:00]  oh Lindsay Lohan  yeah there  I  have you noticed  that there are  semi-nude pictures  of Lindsay Lohan  all over the studio  they've been getting  thrown around  uh  apparently she likes  exposing her breasts  there's a picture of her  I guess taken by the  paparazzi  when she's in a car  trying to hide her face  and she's covering up  her face  but not her nipples  yet her boobs  are just pouring  out of her dress  and I must say  lovely  very nice 
[02:26:30]  very lovely  she's got some  big uh  big canage  Anthony I don't want to be  the buzz kill today though  yeah  she's getting chunky  yeah I saw something  in the uh  she's getting really chunky  she's got like uh  thunder thighs  in the National Enquirer  they got the latest pictures  and uh  she's got some  big ass thighs  there's a picture of her  from that movie  that she was just in  what's the name  of that movie there  Kev  Kev knows everything  about movies  could be Mean Girls  Mean Girls  that was the one  and she's in a little  skirt 
[02:27:00]  little short skirt  and uh  looking really good  really good  then there's a picture  of her now  walking down the street  like the Enquirer  likes to get  and uh  she's wearing a skirt  and you can see her thighs  and man  they're kinda  adding on some pounds  to those thighs  she's got a big belly  maybe she's doing  shallow Hal too  oh there you go  no she's just  putting on weight  she's eating better  um  hopefully by the next movie  though she'll get  that bulimia thing down  the actresses 
[02:27:30]  have it  pretty well down  in Hollywood  and some people  like to criticize this  but I don't  I think it's kind of  a good thing  if they could keep it  in control  when they're off  and they're not filming  they eat  and they hang out  and do whatever  they want to do  and when they want  to get in shape  for a movie  they do the bulimia thing  I'm all for a finger  every once in a while  right  you eat  you stick your finger  down your throat  you puke it all up  and then before you know it  those pounds melt away  as do the  as does the enamel  on your teeth  as they rot away 
[02:28:00]  but hey  it keeps you nice  keeps you nice  and slender  and svelte  and she  hopefully when she goes  to make the next movie  she'll puke up those pounds  Opie  she's got to be  a little careful though  well I think  as she gets older  it's going to be  out of her hands  it's one of those chicks  because you know  she did that movie  when she was 17 years old  you know  they cross a line  some of the girls  and you can tell  she has the potential  to be a big girl  and she crossed over  a line  and all of a sudden  she's putting some 
[02:28:30]  pounds on  usually that line  is 20 years old  20?  is it 20?  you leave the teen  so they go through  the teen years  you leave the teen years  you leave the teen years  and the metabolism changes  and if you're not  careful  and taking that finger  every once in a while  you start getting  a little pudging  there could be problems  down the road  20?  that doesn't leave you  much time  I know  I understand  and then it's all  downhill from there  all downhill  jeepers  jeepers creepers  and then you were  telling me earlier  about Tatum O'Neill 
[02:29:00]  Anthony  oh my god  what a sickly  hot disgusting story  it really is a hot story  but it's sick  why?  because she was  very young at the time  she's got a book  Tatum O'Neill  wrote a book  and it's  it's full of  scandal  her father  Ryan O'Neill  huge drug fiend  back in the 70's  early and mid 70's  when Tatum was  just a little  tater tot  oh 
[02:29:30]  what is that  Bad News Bears music  I gotta tell you  I saw her at a  filter show  here in New York  a couple years ago  Tatum  and she had a little  thong hand  and she looked  fucking hot  you know what it is though  two years ago  she was a crackhead  sort of she says  in her book  a crackhead  another thing you could do  to melt away the pounds  by the way  crack  yeah  if you don't have  a finger handy  get a crack pipe  but do you ever see  a healthy looking  crackhead  you can see healthy  looking bulimics  they just look skinny  the crack kind of  does a little more  than just drop away 
[02:30:00]  the melt away  the pounds  it's a bitch  on the teeth  I need some crack  I was so guilty  you had a crush  on Tatum O'Neill  uh  well when I was  a little kid  see I thought you had  the crush on  Christy McNichols  you guys used to  give me hell  saying that I  I had this  thing for  Christy McNichol  if we had the  ONA archives  I could break out  a tape and prove  that you once  said on the show  no never  that uh  you had a thing  for Christy McNichol  I will deny that  forever  because I  never thought 
[02:30:30]  Christy McNichol  looked like anything  but a dyke  and uh  not even an  attractive one  she looked just  like her brother  Jimmy McNichol  with a worse mullet  that's what she  looked like  little Jimmy  McNichol  it's uh  better than  Florida Evans  no  nice  Anthony I got a  good uh  I got a question  for you  yeah  uh  who's hotter  Jimmy McNichols  or Christy McNichols  no I gotta pick  Christy McNichols  to keep it out  of the gay zone  of course  Christy McNichols  better than a guy 
[02:31:00]  I was just  testing you  but uh  we'll test every  once in a while  but Tatum O'Neill  was the the cuter  one  back in the  older days  and I'm talking  when I was a  little kid  so you know  I was always more  attracted to girls  my age  than I was  uh  older women  cause I hear  guys when they  were growing up  going  oh yeah  I used to be  into Jeannie  from I Dream of Jeannie  that was me  now when  when you're  I watched  I watched Jeannie  convinced that  a boob was gonna  pop out  I had no concept  of like  that it was on tape 
[02:31:30]  I thought it was  like a live show  and that  there was a possibility  that a boob  was gonna pop out  yeah that was  never gonna happen  well I learned that  later  as a kid though  I never looked at  them as like  sex objects  them  Marianne and Ginger  it was never a thing  like like wow  they're hot  because at 10  or 11 years old  or 12 years old  I would look at  girls that were  also that age  and you know  I thought they were  cute and what not  not um  looking at grown  women 
[02:32:00]  it was like  that's a woman  I had no  attraction to that  it was like  your mom  or something  or your mom's  friend  your mom's  extremely hot  friend  but I wasn't  into that  so I was into  the little  Tatum O'Neill  thing when I was  that age  and not  Christy McNichol  used to watch  that movie  what was that  one where they  were in camp  Little Darlings  Little Darlings  with that dyke  from uh  Sex and the City  Cynthia Nixon  Cynthia Nixon  was in that one  yeah she was  a little kid  in that one  she was the  little flower  child  right the little 
[02:32:30]  hippie chick  was she a  lesbian in that  movie  because I don't  I don't think  I ever saw that  too young  oh okay  too young  you never saw  that one  but they were  in camp  and Christy  McNichol  and Tatum  O'Neill  had a bet  who would  lose their  virginity  first  it was like  porno  for a kid  that was  kids porno  where if you  were a kid  that was  your version  of porno  because they're  talking about  sex  Christy  McNichol  loses it  to Matt  Dillon  to Matt  Dillon  I forgot  it was  Matt  Dillon  so what's 
[02:33:00]  up with  Tatum  O'Neill  well she  wrote a  book with  some bombshells  in it as  they like  to call  them  do you  know that  when she  was 12  years old  she was  involved  in some  drug  drug  fueled  orgy  that  involved  Melanie  Griffith  who is  just another  Hollywood  whore  I'm convinced  she was  just a  hooker  in LA  and just  got lucky  you think  she was  a hooker  yeah man  you hear  the stories  about her  you know  over the  years  and it  just  seems  like  she  was  selling  her  body  and  somehow  like 
[02:33:30]  turned it  into  acting  when she  was 14  she hooked  up with  Don Johnson  14  and Don  Johnson  was  doing things  with her  it was  the 70s  Opie  what a  different  time  Tatum  will reveal  that an  actress  girlfriend  of her  father  Ryan O'Neill  fondled her  when they  were playing  dress up  and that she  was molested  by a male  friend of  Ryan's  when she  was 12  the incident  occurred 
[02:34:00]  during a  trip to  Europe  with her  father  and several  of his  pals  including  an 18  year old  Melanie  Griffith  and a  man  who says  who she  says  was Ryan's  drug dealer  during the  trip  Tatum  walked into  her father's  hotel room  only to  find him  in bed  with  Melanie  she was  all pissed  off at that  so she  took a  bunch of  drugs  she went  to the  dealer  guy  and started  doing drugs  because she  was pissed  off to  find Melanie  Griffith  in bed  with her  father  so she  passes out  doing the  drugs  little  12 year  old  girl 
[02:34:30]  can't  handle  her  drugs  passes  out  she  wakes  up  finds  herself  naked  in bed  with the  dealer  touching her  with the  drug dealer  in a sick  twist  Ryan gave  Melanie  some money  to take  Tatum O'Neill  on a  sightseeing  trip to  Paris  but the  innocent  outing  morphed  into an  orgy  of drugs  and sex  with Melanie  and Tatum  and some  guys  one thing  led to  another  and they  were all  partying  doing drugs  and it  turned into  an orgy 
[02:35:00]  and Tatum  writes that  she not  only witnessed  the threesome  but joined  in and made  it a foursome  12 people  12  somehow the  12 year old  managed to  return from the  trip still a  virgin  only to lose  her virginity to  an older  stuntman  not long  afterwards  a stuntman  Tatum also  writes that  Ryan smacked  her after  she was  nominated for  best supporting  actress for  paper moon  I think she  was eight  or something 
[02:35:30]  and her  father's just  smacking her  around  physically beat  her  so I guess  that's why  she decided  to marry  John McEnroe  to get away  from the  violence  Tatum also  attacks McEnroe  she turned  into a  well the  tennis racket  doesn't hurt  as much  right  it's got  some spring  to it  it has a  little give  she turned  into a  needle  using heroin  addict  during her  marriage  and lost  custody of  her three  children  she writes  she somehow  survived her 
[02:36:00]  marriage to  McEnroe  who like her  father beat  her in  violent rages  so these  girls I don't  know they  kind of are  attracted to  that kind of  thing when it  happens with  their father  due to  steroids  yes due to  steroid  abuse she  blames it  on saying  that John  McEnroe did  steroids  could have  been roid  rage out  there on  the court  and it  says Tatum  hit rock  bottom two  years ago  when she  was caught  smoking crack  she claims to  be all  cleaned up  now though  and boy 
[02:36:30]  all those  years gone  by I  remember  watching her  in the  bad news  bears when  I was a  kid and  you know  she was just  an adorable  little kid  with Walter  Matthau  turned into  a crack  head  maybe it  was the  beers that  Walter  Matthau  gave all  the kids  where they  allowed kids  to drink beer  in movies  the good  old days  the good  old days  man you  could not  get away  and that  was a kid  movie  you couldn't  get away  with it  I guarantee they'll  remake that movie  someday  they are remaking  that movie  and that scene  will be  with soda pop  with Billy Bob  with Billy Bob  Thornton 
[02:37:00]  really  oh Billy Bob  Thornton  you know  the whole  handing out  the beer  thing is  going to be  cut from  the new  version  they will  not have  the kids  drink beer  because they really know what to do in Hollywood to make movies better  yeah  they will not have the kids drink beer  any other casting from that movie  I don't know any other  who's playing Tatum O'Neill's part  I don't know  hey Anthony do I have time for show and tell  show and tell  yeah  I encourage people to bring in stuff from time to time  and then get up in front of the class and talk about it 
[02:37:30]  what kind of a lame idea  what kind of  who was the first teacher that decided she hadn't prepped for class  and came up with that brilliant idea  that's what that was all about  look  I can't bother writing any tests or lessons  just bring something from home and talk about it  look I know I got a hot day tonight  and I'm going to be really hungover  and I'm going to do some blow  and have two hours of sleep  it's show and tell tomorrow kids  that's what they want to say  just bring something from home and talk about it  I can't be bothered  it'll take up half the day 
[02:38:00]  little bastards  talk about grandfather's little freaking dat  you know what  when I was a kid  and I believe it was first grade or second grade or something  the teacher did a project  where we all planted vegetables  in the little milk cartons  remember that  and watch them grow  and they would die before they reached maturity  because they're in little milk cartons  well my uncle had a garden  and I took it out of the milk carton  and transplanted it into the garden  and when it was done  I brought one of the vegetables into my teacher 
[02:38:30]  for sure  to show her like  wow this is the vegetable plant  and you know what it was  the plant  it was a cucumber plant  so I just come into class  with this huge  and I picked the biggest one  it was this big giant cucumber  and I gave it to her  and I remember her laughing  when I handed it to her  and I just thought she was pleased  that I brought her the cucumber  and you think back now  of course  it's like oh here's a little kid  bringing her this huge phallic dildo  that's not the best uncle story though  oh well my uncle was very into gardening in the 70s 
[02:39:00]  my uncle Joe  just tell that story really fast  because that's an amazing  well it was a short time  after my parents split up  so it was just my mother living  I was living with my mother  and my brother and my sister  you know my father  booked out to California  and my mother took in my uncle  at that time  as to be I guess  the man of the house or something  rent out the room  make a little extra money  you needed a father figure  rent out the downstairs  yeah like my uncle Joe  is going to be the father figure  god damn hippie 
[02:39:30]  he's a god damn hippie  and he was into gardening  so he planted  what he told my mother  was a basil oregano hybrid  planted in the backyard  just in case you need about  25 to 30 huge plants worth  of basil oregano hybrid  and my mother was fine with this  so my father comes to visit us  little weekend visit  one weekend visit  did he go and play catch 
[02:40:00]  at the schoolyard  no but with my father  the divorce visits  were all about  taking me to the local bar  sitting me down  him drinking  watching the ball game  or something  and me you know  drinking a shirley temple  or a coke  and thrilled that I could  open up peanuts  and throw the shells  on the floor  and playing defender  in the corner  no it was before video games  it's like  yeah I know  it was like 1972  something like that  dude people think  we're in our 20s  yeah right  okay  weren't you playing  your playstation 2  in the  I was playing Glaxon 
[02:40:30]  I was playing Halo  yeah  no it wasn't even  whack whack whack whack  not even  it was nothing to do  I do remember  no I do remember  playing Lunar Lander  so I guess there was  some kind of  and Pong  they had Pong games  ooh what a thrill  a minute that one  remember when you  played Pong  and thought it could  never get better than this  this is the coolest thing  I'm playing a game  on my TV  great thrill a minute 
[02:41:00]  it was fun for 10 seconds  let's make the paddle bigger  so we can pretend  we're playing tennis  put a goal in it  and it's hockey  now I'm playing squash  it's a wall in the middle  flip the switch  big switches  and oh god  those games were awful  it was all we had though  alright so where were we  so my uncle planted  these plants  and they grew  obviously there were pot plants  and they were 10 feet tall  planted in these huge garbage pails 
[02:41:30]  in the backyard  and they took up  our entire patio area  and my father comes  to pick us up  and just lays into my mother  and says  what are you doing  do you understand  if the police see pot plants  growing in the yard  they could take the kids away  from you  you will go to jail  and my mother just looks at them  puts on the face  like  excuse me  it's a basil oregano hybrid  which my father was just like 
[02:42:00]  you're fine  I'll go back out to California  and not deal with you  but he was growing huge plants  he cut them down  with this big machete  and hung them in his apartment  the whole house  smelled like pot  smelled like pot  for years  probably still does  and that was my uncle's  contribution to us growing up  and probably started my brother  on his long road  to smoking weed  another one  my brother tried it once  in Huntington  hence the timing  when he comes in  to do our show  yeah 
[02:42:30]  hence Joe's impeccable  comic timing  on the microphone  could be pot induced  he knows I'm kidding  I love him  you know that  the neighbors were growing pot  across the street  from our house  yeah  in Huntington once  there was a little wooded area  and I had just  found out in school  I had learned about pot  and you know  when the guy comes in  and the cop  and he shows you  the drawings  and all the stats  about pot  and everything  and I was in the woods 
[02:43:00]  across the street  and I found pot plants growing  and it was my brother  and his friend Lloyd  that lived next door  growing these pot plants  hello Lloyd  Lloyd  and I took him  and pulled him  out of the ground  and I run  and I go  mom look  I found marijuana  she goes  oh wow  okay well  just take it out back  and you know  step on it  or whatever you want to do  destroy it  destroy it  so I took it out back  on the patio  and I'm just crushing it  into the ground 
[02:43:30]  into the cement  and I look up  at the big living room  bow window  looking over our backyard  and there's Joe  standing there  looking at me  with I swear  a tear  a tear  in his eye  as he's watching me  crush the pot plant  and then later on  I see him outside  where I was squishing it  on his knees  picking up  these little  tattered remnants  of pot leaves  it looked like  Richard Pryor  looking for the crack  and the coke  and the carpet  looking for the crack  yeah 
[02:44:00]  and he went inside  and dried it in the oven  and tried to smoke it  nice  I was a little dick  when I was a kid man  just a buzz kill  alright you guys ready  for show and tell  show and tell  brought this thing  in today  for you guys  what have you brought  for the class  gotta take it  out of the bag  want it to be  a surprise everybody  oh no  ok now I'm on to it  no you're not  I can tell  from Ben's reaction  Ben hasn't seen  anything yet 
[02:44:30]  I figured out  what it was  I didn't see it  but I can figure out  what it is  oh no  we need dramatic music  alright  ok  oh god  ok  just put that away  it looks like  it's paler  god I can't look  at the face  we should go put that  on what's his name's desk  it looks like him  no  Andrew Gore 
[02:45:00]  said he was coming by  to take this back  I know  I can't look at that  pull it away  he gave me this  two years ago  it's been tucked in my closet  for two years  it's a pickled punk  he needs to take this back  it's what they call  in the carny business  a pickled punk  it is a fetus  in a jar  and that one looks like  some kind of  deformed fetus  because most of them  in those carnival days  for the sideshows  were these deformed fetuses  and they would call it  little devil boy  if it had horns 
[02:45:30]  or you know  a tail  it would be monkey boy  and that one's got  this big oblong head  here pass it around  it looks like  you know what the head  looks like  it looks like alien head  well it's got little  eyebrows and stuff  don't pass it  anywhere near me  look you know what  this is not a bit  this was given to me  two years ago  and uh  I really want to  return it to its owner  disgusting  I don't want this anymore  it has caused  nothing but problems 
[02:46:00]  thought it was in Albany  oh don't look  directly into its face  I don't know  what that'll do  so is Andrew Gore  coming by  to take this back  please  put it down  oh just get rid of it  no you can't  don't look at its ass  no you can't  just get rid of it  I'm not  this is not a bit  I understand  you feel it's like  the tiki  this is the part of the program  where I'm being  dead serious  you feel it's like  the tiki  from the Brady Bunch  yes  and it has to be  brought back to the cave  like Mr. Hanalei said 
[02:46:30]  yes  and Opie feels  the same way  like this  this fetus in a jar  has to be returned  to its rightful owner  at the time  I thought it would be  a cool uh  conversation starter  I can't look at that thing  and uh  it needs a tan  I was severely  wrong  don't shake it  because I think  the top leaks  and I gotta uh  give it back to its owner  which is  Andrew Gore  ugh  no bit  no jokes  I don't want this thing anymore  but you can't just 
[02:47:00]  get rid of it  I have to hand it  back to him  I don't know how you  wanted it in the first place  is he around Ben  I'm serious  call him up  he's supposed to come in  you don't mix it up  with your coffee  is he coming in  talk to Steve  I don't  Andy kind of freaks me out  no offense  I know  I'm not a big fan  I am not a big fan  of his  Steve is  Steve  uh Andy might have flaked  oh  he said he  yeah exactly  I can't  deal with him  or his stuff  or his wares  I hope he's fascinated  by this stuff 
[02:47:30]  not anymore  well  no you're still  fascinated by it  you just don't want it  in your ownership  I'm fascinated by the macabre  when we were in town  you told me  hey we should go down there  and take a look at his place  and I was like  I have no ambition  to go down there  I don't want to see this guy  I don't want to see his collection  of disgusting stuff  I love porno  I will say that  but with the disgusting stuff  I can't take it  I don't like  the macabre  the macabre  I'm not a fan of the macabre 
[02:48:00]  is it macabre  it's macabre  macabre  the corn on macabre  I'm not even  trying to make a joke  I just don't want that anymore  you've had it for so long  I think you're  you have custody now  it's the first time  you adopted it  it's the first time  I've seen it in two years  it was tucked in my closet  it's a long long time  I looked at it  now it's creeping me out  it's going to give me nightmares  you know what it reminds me of  the little baby thing  an eraser head  remember when he had it  it looked like a goat head  alright well 
[02:48:30]  not a fan  what kind of jar is it in  I don't know  that jar is so old  is it a pickle jar  not olive  olive jar  olive jar  it's a very very old jar  is that the name of the thing  olive  call it olive  this was  that used to be displayed  at sideshows  yeah and Opie  Opie's like when we're in Washington  come on let's go over  and check out Andy's house  you gotta see his collection  he lives in a hip area in D.C.  we'll go over and get some dinner  and go over there  I would probably puke 
[02:49:00]  if I wanted that guy's apartment  yeah  I agree now  so never  alright we gotta take a break Anthony  we don't really have to  but  it's disgusting  get it away  put it back in the bag  we gotta regroup  and bring the funny back to the show  put it back in the bag please  we've been  it's a big gimme gag  we've been featuring tracks  from our Dementor World CD  today  something we discovered  we're allowed to play  from our old days  we're not allowed to play much  from our old days  but this CD  we put out way before  fair game  Infinity Broadcasting

[02:55:00]  cause baby  cause I'll do it  coming home  i'm sorry i've never seen one that small before  jump change  that's right  is that your belly button  this is the best show ever  the O.B. Anthony Show  this is the O.B. Sundry  the Eda 
[02:55:30]  This is the O&A virus spreading across America on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:56:00]  Thanks for checking us out.  Thanks for turning other people on to this mess.  We really appreciate it.  It's getting more gooder every day.  Much more gooder.  Going to hit our stride soon.  I can feel it.  I feel it.  We got Frenchie outside.  We got Black Earl outside.  Black Earl in the building.  In the building.  Making his first appearance on the new show.  We got a real celebrity calling us in a few minutes.  Kevin Smith wants to say hi and congratulate us on going to Satellite Radio.  Very, very cool.  Shell out more money to him for the latest Clerks. 
[02:56:30]  What is it?  Clerks X?  Clerks 10, yeah.  Clerks 10.  Clerks X.  10th anniversary.  I already own Clerks on DVD.  I enjoy it.  Not like this.  Oh, of course not like this.  Now I have to buy it again.  How many times are they going to make you pay for the same movie?  For the same movie.  If you really figure it out from the beginning to where it goes in the end here.  You buy it in the movie theater.  Right.  You go in and watch the movie in the movie theater.  Sometimes twice because it was such a good play.  Such a good movie.  You're buying it on cable.  You're paying your cable bill and you get it on cable television. 
[02:57:00]  Well, and maybe even just throwing it on the pay-per-view.  Right.  Pay-per-view.  You might get that.  Punch that up.  Sure.  A couple extra bucks.  You buy the DVD.  Well, before that, you know, you go on vacation.  You're in a hotel.  Oh, look what's on TV.  There you go.  Gotta, you know, rent that.  Might have to rent that one for the night on the still-in-theaters section of the hotel  television.  Then the DVD comes out.  You gotta get it on DVD.  Perhaps before you even buy it, you rent it.  Right.  Maybe once.  Oh, that's right. 
[02:57:30]  We forgot the whole Blockbuster.  You rented it at Blockbuster.  Oh, my God.  So how many levels are we up to?  I don't know.  But a while after that, you decide, God, that was a good movie.  I think I'll buy it for my DVD collection.  So you go out and you buy it.  And you think it ends there, right, Anthony?  You would think it ends there, but no.  Finally ends.  It never ends.  You probably spend close to 100 bucks on each movie at this point.  Right.  At least, you know, the good movies, the Blockbusters.  Probably 100 bucks.  And it's not over yet.  Because just because you own the DVD doesn't mean it's over.  Because now they put out a more gooder DVD. 
[02:58:00]  One with the commentary and interviews and making of and behind the scenes and docudrama.  Special edition.  Special edition.  Director's cut.  Digitally remastered.  What?  Now you have to buy it again.  Again.  I am so tired of this.  They're brilliant, though.  They figured out a way to make you pay for a movie multiple times.  To buy the same stuff over and over and over. 
[02:58:30]  Imagine if they could do that with a...  Just go to jail, bitch!  Sorry.  We could do that with a wrench.  Just selling a wrench at Sears.  You buy a wrench and they put out the same wrench, but it's a special edition wrench, so you buy it again.  It would never work.  But with DVDs, oh, I gotta get this.  I gotta get it again.  It's special edition.  So I'm buying the same stuff.  And I'm the worst.  I will just go out and buy it.  I heard, what was it?  Goodfellas.  I own Goodfellas.  I watch it many times.  They put out a special edition. 
[02:59:00]  I had to get the goddamn special edition.  Clerks now.  Kevin Smith is putting out a special 10th anniversary of Clerks.  Does anyone really enjoy the extras, though?  In general.  Well, every once in a while there's a good one that comes out where you have to check  out the commentary and the extras and all that.  But in general, it's usually crap.  I'm very into the behind-the-scenes stuff, but I understand what you're saying.  A lot of people don't care.  Also, they show the stills of the costumes they're making.  Who the F cares?  Man, let me tell you, the Lord of the Rings DVDs, there was so many extras. 
[02:59:30]  And some of them really good.  They did a really good job on documenting the filming of all those movies.  So the documentary part was really good.  If you're into knowing how the special effects work and everything, they had separate sections  on just the special effects of the movie, which was great.  But, yeah, there's this section of photos and costumes and storyboards.  They're little sketches.  I don't want to go through the storyboards of the entire movie and watch a sketch of every  shot.  You know, that's not really entertaining.  Need not be on the DVD.  And now, the latest thing that I bought is the Star Wars DVDs. 
[03:00:00]  This Lucas should be shot.  He's changed things around.  He pops in new scenes.  He takes out old scenes.  What happened to the original Star Wars, where you look back with a little bit of nostalgia?  Sure.  You remember going into the movies and seeing it for the first time.  I want to see it like that.  So the special effects look really fake these days.  And you know something? 
[03:00:30]  So what?  The stormtrooper bangs his head as he's coming in to fight.  I like that.  He slips on the floor.  He slips on the floor.  And they left it in.  Yeah.  You know what?  I like that.  And the special effects, if you look back at the time and realize when the movie was  made, you go, wow, that was really good for the time.  I think they used little models back then.  A lot of models, right?  They didn't have the CGI where you could just...  They didn't have the green screens and...  Yeah.  They would use them with models and stuff, which is fine.  They just didn't have the computer where you make it in a computer. 
[03:01:00]  You make the ships in a computer.  Models on fishing line, I do believe.  That's what they did.  They put the models out there and you...  Slide them down a fishing line.  There you go.  Real explosions blowing up the little model up.  Yeah.  They put pyrotechnics in there and now everything's done digitally.  And for some reason, George Lucas figured, hey, I can make the movie better by putting  in CGI now.  So completely out of place and not needed are these creatures walking around where they 
[03:01:30]  weren't before.  I want the Star Wars I remember watching.  That's what I want.  Oh, leave George Lucas alone.  Kevin, how are you, buddy?  What's up, guys?  It's Kevin Smith, our first real celebrity on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank God.  What?  Do you mean Moore hasn't been on the show yet?  Not yet.  No, not yet.  He's waiting for last comic standing to end and then he'll be back with us, I'm sure.  Kevin, I know you're a big Star Wars fan.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:02:00]  What do you think of the special edition?  I'm just happy to have it on DVD.  See, the son of a bitch made you happy that it's out on DVD at all.  Totally.  I'm not one of them.  You know, I'm just, I'm total Uncle Tom for George Lucas.  You're not a purist, one of those, because I've read the reviews where it either gets  four stars or one star.  There's nothing in between.  And the people that give it one star are so pissed off that he's added things in and  taken things out that they cannot handle it.  They're ready to kill themselves.  I just, to me, I don't know. 
[03:02:30]  It's his movies, right?  So let him, if he wants to add stuff and if he feels it's a continuing work in progress  that he can update every 10 years and the technology jumps, let him do it.  Makes him happy.  I don't know.  Have you, are you saying this because you've superimposed some CGI on Clerks?  Basically, in Clerks 10, we include the scene where Greedo shoots first.  See, now that is a perfect example.  Now, you can't even be into that.  No, I was never into that. 
[03:03:00]  That was the dumbest thing.  That's why I really don't like, because I thought it was, even as a kid, I thought,  oh my God, how pimp.  When, you know, Han Solo shoots, when he just blows his dude away, the dude's giving him  a little grief in the cantina and he's just like, oh fuck, hey, wait a second, can we,  we're on a satellite, can we curse?  Oh, you can curse, you can do whatever you want.  You should have heard the show earlier, a girl was getting off with a power drill.  Getting off with a drill bit.  Was she in a church confessional at the time?  No, that's, we'll wait a little while before we do that.  You might want to build up to that one. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  I like how Han shot him under the table, too.  He didn't even show him the gun.  Totally.  It's like that, like you said, completely pimp.  Well, it was a boy, pimp, pitches the bartender a quarter.  Well, perhaps because he's a space pirate, because the guy's supposed to be like a roving  scumbag, and now, because George Lucas has kids, he figures he's got to make these, because  he's a role model now or something, and he's got to be a do-gooder, so they change the movie.  I don't like that.  Be happy that George Lucas' life didn't take other turns, and instead he would have turned 
[03:04:00]  Han into a butt pirate.  Could you imagine that?  Instead of shooting Greedo, he just spins him around on the table, face down.  Drills him.  Totally.  What do you got coming in on Clerks 10?  Clerks 10, it's a pretty sweet DVD, as far as I'm concerned.  Three discs and lots of extras, and the best extra on that disc, though, on the whole set  is this documentary that our friend Phil Benson put together, which is a 90-minute doc called 
[03:04:30]  The Snowball Effect.  It's kind of telling the whole story of Clerks.  Like how, from a story from me as a child all the way up to the movie getting bought.  Really?  It's better than the movie itself, to be honest with you.  That's hard, that's a hard sell right there.  One of my favorite movies, man.  Thank you, sir.  It's right up there.  And may I say, made for $10.50 is what I hear.  $10, sir.  $9.  $9.35.  Very, very inexpensive movie to make. 
[03:05:00]  Kevin, I want to thank you for Vulgar.  Oh, Brian Johnson's movie.  Yeah, the only movie I was ever horrified by.  The Clown Rape Picture.  The Clown Rape Picture.  Yeah, I remember that one, sure.  Yeah.  I found a copy of that, and I checked it out.  I was horrified.  And nothing bothers me, by the way.  Nothing.  Total date movie.  It was...  Yeah, that's a chick flick.  We're a little distracted, because I think CBS is here, and they're setting up cameras in  the studio.  Oh.  For the next segment.  Get out of here.  CBS.  So it's got to be accurate.  What is it?  They want to talk to the pioneers of satellite radio. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  We are the pioneers.  We are the first.  We invented satellite radio.  Basically, Dan Router's going to come in and say you invented satellite radio.  That's right.  See, that wouldn't be good for us.  We have documents saying that, Hopi and Anthony...  We're first.  Oh, boy.  How is it?  How is it?  How is satellite radio?  It's pretty cool.  It's a trip.  It's quite different from broadcast radio.  Right.  Not just with the curses, but just the subject matter you can cover, you know?  Yeah, that's the best part of this.  You don't have to beat around the bush.  You just say what you're feeling.  If there's a girl, and she's been masturbating, and we have audio of it, we can say that she's 
[03:06:00]  been masturbating.  We don't have to spend ten minutes trying to let everybody know what she's doing without  actually saying it.  Trying to talk around it.  Yeah.  Which leaves a dilemma of coming up with more material to fill the time.  Jesus Christ.  We actually have to prepare and do a show now.  Yeah, we have no commercials.  So, technically, we're doing like five hours of material.  Whoa, that light's not too bright.  Whoa, that is a bright light.  Hey!  I just got a tan.  Bill Cosby would say that you guys aren't working hard enough, because now you're just  going to be blue, blue, blue. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  We're trying to keep it under control, Kevin.  And Bill Cosby knows.  I think it's genius.  I think the idea of being able to say whatever you want on the radio, finally, is such an idea  whose time has come a long time ago.  Yeah, what a great thought.  And when I say something, I need to see you.  To be able to say what you want in America.  I mean, C-U-M, cum, not C-O-M-E.  Right.  Because on satellite, we can talk about cum.  But then, you know, we also had clever breaks today, Kevin.  It's all about balance.  There you go.  That's right.  And so, do you guys have to do commercials or no? 
[03:07:00]  No, that's why we're kind of just talking to you still.  We just bullshit.  We just kind of hang out and, yeah, there's plenty of time for us.  You know what they do?  When we go to break, you know, so we can get coffee or go to the bathroom, they play George  Carlin bits.  Do they really?  Yeah.  Washington doesn't know funny yet.  See what happens?  We're in New York and then when we take a break, they take the show in Washington and they  just don't know funny yet.  They think George Carlin is the only funny human being ever born again.  George Carlin's hysterical, by the way.  Of course.  But when you hear the same bits every break, it's a little old, you know? 
[03:07:30]  He's a god.  He's a total god.  Only made one bad movie in his life, Jersey Girl.  Oh, Jesus.  I got to ask you, how pissed were you when Jigley came out and just got trashed?  You had to see something in the cards there.  You know, you sit there.  I was stupidly, I was going, well, America will ignore the bad movie and embrace what  I felt was a good movie.  Right.  And I was partly right. 
[03:08:00]  You know, like Jigley made six million, we made 25, but I don't know.  It sucked, because that movie could have done, like, at least 50 million bucks.  Yeah, it just had this pall over it, because, you know, the same two people.  And I like how you completely dropped J-Lo from any of the commercials.  Like, she wasn't even in it.  It was such an albatross around the neck.  That sucked.  You couldn't believe it.  It was like Germany for the next 60 years after the Holocaust.  Yeah.  No matter what they did, people were just like, yeah, but you did the Holocaust, remember? 
[03:08:30]  And you're like, ugh.  Yeah, it doesn't matter what comes out of Germany.  It's just like, yeah, but try to live past the point of the Holocaust.  Exactly.  Like, look, we've got this kid, this little kid's amazing.  Yeah, but Bannifer's in it.  And you're like, well, but George Carlin's great.  Yeah, but Bannifer's in it.  Yeah, but Ben's best work.  Yeah, but he's half of Bannifer.  You couldn't escape it.  And then people would just trash it for the sake of trash it.  The really gratifying thing is when you read reviews, and not, you know, from critics, 
[03:09:00]  of course, because they dig in on their position and stay there.  Yeah.  But, like, from people on our website who would be like, you know, fuck Jersey Girl.  And then six months later, they're like, you know what, dude?  I rented Jersey Girl.  It's actually pretty good.  And you're like, thanks, Mom.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Getting pissed at the message board geeks.  Yeah.  All right, Kevin, you're going to come in and hang with us, right?  They always know what it's all about.  Yeah, I'm going to pop in.  I think in November, I'm actually going to be in New York. 
[03:09:30]  I'm going out to New Jersey.  This I love.  I'm going out to New Jersey to receive an award from the New Jersey Educational Association,  the NGEA.  Wow, what did you do?  I was a product of the public school system that made good.  They're going to give me an award.  Isn't that great?  You get honored for something like that.  And I couldn't even go back to my high school and get my diploma.  They won't.  Like, I want to get my honorary high school diploma from my high school.  And all Anthony has to do is a gym class.  I just have to make up, like, some gym credits or something. 
[03:10:00]  So I'll do some pull-ups or, you know.  He just has to climb the rope a few times, and he gets his diploma.  And they won't let him do it.  Play some dodgeball.  I don't know.  Anything.  But they wouldn't even entertain the idea.  A few more credits.  What was the problem?  You didn't want to go shower at the shower time during?  I was kind of one of them.  I was not the get in a room and get naked with a bunch of my pupil mates in school.  It wasn't, like, the thing I really wanted to do.  No, I'd rather be out back smoking pot.  You weren't digging the big parachute?  You wouldn't participate in the big parachute thing?  I think it was a little later than when they brought the big parachute into gym and had us flop it around. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, boy.  That was a lot of fun.  It was, I hated gym class.  I was never into sports or anything when I was in school.  So, I just never went to gym.  I hung out back and smoked pot.  And they never gave me a diploma.  I think I've done okay without it.  And maybe if I make a contribution to their high school radio station, maybe they'll give me a diploma.  I just feel left out.  Now you're playing the game, dude.  A little money, right?  You've got to grease somebody, right?  Did you lose points when you didn't shower in school? 
[03:11:00]  No.  I hear, though, that they did take grades off of some people.  Totally.  I would lose points.  I didn't want to shower.  My dick was tiny.  So, I'd lose points left and right.  And then you do that thing where, like, you quickly, after Jeremy, run in, you just throw your head under the sink.  Wet your head, yeah.  The only guys that wanted to shower were the ones that had the big hogs.  Totally.  You're so right.  Or gay guys.  I would think.  If I was fucking hung huge, I would so be in the shower every day.  Soaping it up and, like, look.  But, you know.  With porno star shaved balls. 
[03:11:30]  Absolutely.  Just, like, showing it off.  Making sure the water's nice and warm so it gets extra hunky.  Oh, now there's a girl in here.  I know.  We can't talk dirty anymore.  What an attractive lady that's in here now.  Because when it comes down to it, we're really, like, nice guys and behave when there's a woman around.  Isn't that terrible?  No more.  We're not talking about the sluts that come in here.  We're talking about a lady that comes in.  No more of that wow stuff.  Yeah, we do that on Wednesday.  But now there's a lady in here.  So we're going to feel weird discussing anything like that. 
[03:12:00]  Just tell her it's WAF, dude.  It's Kelly from CBS News.  And we've got an AP writer in here.  It's going to get a little crazy now.  Well, Kevin, you also have Clerks 2 you're working on?  Working on Clerks 2 in January.  We start shooting.  Everyone coming back for that one?  Just the boys.  Just bringing back Dante, Randall, Jay, and Silent Bob.  And it's a funny, funny flick.  I don't doubt it.  Absolutely.  You can doubt it.  I'll prove you wrong.  Okay, I'll doubt it a little bit and then prove me wrong.  Well, congrats, dude, on being back. 
[03:12:30]  That's excellent.  All right, Kevin.  Thanks, man.  And we'll hopefully hook up with you through Big Kev in November.  Yeah, he brags about his little cameo.  Big Kev is my guy.  Yeah.  We didn't believe him.  Big Kev are total comic book nerds.  Yeah.  Believe me, we know.  We didn't believe Kevin for the longest time, but I guess we have to start believing him.  I know.  We were thinking, sure, Kevin Smith knows you.  Sure, you know him.  They would hang out.  I had to show them the Jersey Girl trailer where you could see the top of my head.  Big Kev is a flat-out pimp in the world of comics. 
[03:13:00]  Have you ever seen his sketchbook?  It's huge.  I know.  That's what matters.  In the world of comics, it's not the size of your dick.  It's the size of your sketchbook.  He's my spawn action figure connection also.  Yep.  Yeah.  Any action figure I need, he's there.  He hooks you up.  All right.  Total geek.  Do you want anything special when you come by?  No.  No.  Just don't make me shower, please.  No problem.  No worries.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, Kevin.  Congrats, guys. 
[03:13:30]  Awesome.  Kevin Smith, everyone.  And I think we've got to step aside, take a break, let them set up these lights.  Cameras and action.  Oh, no.  Is this where the shot's going to be?  Boom mics?  Look at me.  I'm complaining.  It's behind, over my shoulder shot.  That's all right.  I'll turn around like this.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Okay.  Steve, give us a break.  We'll be back.  Opie Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na.  Na, na. 
[03:14:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  You know, honey, I knew it was hot and sunny before I even got out of bed today.  Ask me, Ma.  Say it.  Say why.  Repeat after me.  Why?  Because my balls were hanging low.  Let's say that real tight.  We're talking rainstorm.  Half-masked, cloudy with a chance of showers.  That's right, honey.  The penis sinks for itself.  It's got its own brain. 
[03:14:30]  Why do you think the head's bigger than the rest?  I can prove it's got a mind of its own.  You ever get up in the morning and he's already awake?  He's dressed.  He's ready to go, right?  He's in the kitchen making fucking flapjacks.  You're in bed going, come on, Joey.  Five more minutes.  Your penis is going, take me shopping.  I need a new hat.  But you remember when they first came out with the hard-on, huh? 
[03:15:00]  Third, fourth grade.  You're leaning over like the hunchback of Notre Dame.  Teacher calls you up to the board and you're like,  I don't think so, honey.  You're the teacher.  You figure it out, all right?  I got some kind of ligament over here.  I don't know what's going on.  This thing is like alien.  It's drilling into the desk next to me.  Call a cop.  Maybe he'll throw a donut around.  But you grow up.  You learn to accept the hard-on to deal with it.  Accept the P-hard-on, you know? 
[03:15:30]  That's God's joke.  You get up.  You're late for work.  You got to take a squirt.  And Joey's admiring the chandelier.  You got to stand there like a moron and talk him down.  Come on, Joey.  I dig you.  We'll dot I's and cross T's later.  Work with me.  Yeah, the morning hard-on.  And I'll put that up against that Ginsu knife any day.  It'll slice.  It'll dice.  It'll pump your car up if you got a flat tire. 
[03:16:00]  See what I'm saying, Cal?  Heather.  The Maverick Minute from Maverick Business Consulting.  Welcome.  I'm Bill Stark.  And I'm Dr. Marty Cohen.  The subject we've been discussing this week is crisis leadership.  Yesterday, we spoke of five key challenges for a great leader during a crisis  to inform, direct, manage expectations, touch, and inspire.  Tell us more, Marty.  You can help people in crisis manage their expectations by conveying, for example,  that within what is possible, their very best is being done. 
[03:16:30]  Messages such as this will help people maintain perspective and tolerate uncertainty longer.  And?  Competent emotional leadership also speaks to and about shared values,  those things that bind us as a company or as a community.  When we remind people what we're about, we inspire them to function at their best.  And in order to do all these things, a leader has to be highly visible and visible often.  Speaking of crises, Doc, we're out of time.  Join us tomorrow for more about effective crisis leadership.  Maverick LLC. 
[03:17:00]  We make change possible.  Log on at maverickllc.com.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Uh, complete whores.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[03:17:30]  It's a creation against the church.  It's disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  Uh-oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing, and then when they go too far, they  suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts. 
[03:18:00]  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day. 
[03:18:30]  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  Anthony.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  The new club of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  Opie's cool.  Great and beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  I love Opie and Anthony. 
[03:19:00]  We stink.  And the cameras are on, Anthony.  Yeah, I see that.  We're back with the ONA show.  Spreading the virus across America.  The new version of the Opie and Anthony show, uncensored on XM Satellite Radio.  ONA 3.0.  See, I'm trying to give them good sound bites because they're filming right now.  They got the boom box over our, uh, boom box.  Boom box.  The boom mic over our heads.  Not too distracting. 
[03:19:30]  A lot of people saying, um, Kevin Smith sounded like he was smoking pot.  He sounded really tired.  Did he call from L.A.?  Did he call from L.A.?  Yeah, he was calling from L.A.  Oh, see what a trooper.  It is early.  He was calling at like 3 in the morning then.  Especially for him.  Not bad at all.  Doesn't seem like a wake-up early kind of guy.  Not at all.  Is he, uh, Big Kev, big friend of, of, uh, Kevin Smith?  What's that?  Is he, uh, an early morning kind of guy?  Do you know that?  Definitely not.  Being a close personal friend?  Definitely not an early morning guy.  No.  We totally believed you were, uh, you were lying, though. 
[03:20:00]  That's what we thought.  I hope you learned a valuable lesson.  While we're giving these guys our A material.  It's so distracting.  They got lights in here.  A very cute reporter, Kelly, from CBS News.  She's going to interview us afterwards.  You know they're just going to, uh, show the board, our faces, a few mic things, quick shots like that.  Me nodding a few times, you know.  And then it goes back to, uh, whatever they go back to.  I bet they want me to do this.  Push a button so it looks good for the TV.  Ooh, do that.  That was a good one.  That was a good one. 
[03:20:30]  Like, push the slider up, make believe I'm doing something.  Okay.  Okay, I gotta tell you, you have to stop tapping your pen.  Why?  Because yesterday, I'm driving home, listening to the rebroadcast, and I was like, what?  What is that sound?  What?  And I turn it up, and it sounded like someone, uh, shuffling poker chips from the World Series of Poker.  Just you tapping the pen.  It's driving people crazy.  It says, uh, enough tapping the pen.  F-U-O-P.  Stop tapping the pen.  All right, take all my pens away. 
[03:21:00]  You'll just fidget with something else.  This is not what they wanted, though.  I'm just talking.  I'm commenting on the instant feedback.  They're here to hear us say, fuck.  I know that.  It's uncensored radio at its best.  This won't have any sound to it.  It'll just be us.  The cameraman just raised his eyebrows like, yes, we got what we wanted.  We got it.  We got it.  And of course, they'll cut out everything else, and all you hear is, hey, fuck.  Make us look like idiots.  I know how this goes.  Because that's what satellite radio is all about.  Being able to curse. 
[03:21:30]  That's right.  There, I gave them that sound bite.  They could use that.  That's why we're here.  It's a curse.  We're glad we're on satellite radio, because we don't have to be responsible anymore.  All right, that's another one they'll use.  All right.  Give them a good one.  Give them a good one that will make people go, oh, see?  See?  I told you they shouldn't have given them a job.  We're not responsible for what you hear.  And the FCC stinks.  Oh, that's a good one.  There's no one regulating us.  No FCC regulating this show.  And we're fucking glad.  And we can do whatever the hell we want now. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, this is all the stuff that's going to make it now on television.  All the good stuff.  We're pioneers in the industry.  That's right, Robin.  We invented the satellite.  Not just satellite radio.  The whole satellite.  I'm sure Howard will make believe this isn't on TV.  You know what the S in NASA stands for?  Stern.  I invented NASA.  I invented satellites.  I'm the pioneer.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Shut up.  That'll make it, too, by the way. 
[03:22:30]  Is this what you want, or what?  Is this the good stuff?  You want the angry, kind of like, God, they shouldn't have given them a job.  They're the stupid, sex-insane Pats DJs.  Look, we know how the media works.  We'll give you whatever you want.  Yeah, whatever you need, man.  Instead of, like, filming for an hour and waiting for us to fuck up, just give us the lines and we'll do it for you.  We'll get all the good lines out in ten minutes for you.  Because we know if CBS is doing a piece on us, it can't be good.  It can't be.  I mean, we know.  Nothing personal.  But we just know it's got to be something that makes us look really bad and how satellite radio probably shouldn't hire people like us. 
[03:23:00]  Even though it's not regulated by the FCC and it's subscriber-based, so little kids can't accidentally stumble upon it,  we still should not have an outlet for this debauchery and pornography.  We had an intelligent break about the debate tonight.  We did?  Yeah, they weren't here to film that.  They just want us cursing and losing our minds and showing that we're really stupid.  Maybe we should tell you what the wiffle ball bat's for. 
[03:23:30]  No, no, no.  No, that might be a little too far.  Yeah, look at Kelly's face.  No, we just play wiffle ball in here.  Yeah, we play wiffle ball in the halls during our breaks.  That's all.  Shut up, Anthony.  You're going to ruin it.  If away, all day at bay.  That's right.  Yeah.  And Kelly, are you going to interview us in a little while?  A little later.  A little later?  You got tough questions?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.  I want them answered immediately.  Immediately.  Yeah, you got hard-hitting questions?  Sure, why not? 
[03:24:00]  Why not?  She's like, I don't even want to be part of your broadcast.  I did not want this assignment.  I'm not on mic.  If I could be out of the studio, I would be.  We understand.  We understand.  You've done a good job during your life to get up to this point of being a correspondent  on CBS, and she doesn't want to ruin it by being on our show.  I understand that completely.  Yeah.  I don't want to ruin my...  I don't have any credibility.  Who am I kidding?  God, I stink.  No, we're not going to play the drill, though, Kev.  We don't even know what that means. 
[03:24:30]  Big Kev's just trying to get us in trouble.  I know.  What is that?  The what?  All that.  What?  The drill, though?  Uh-oh, she's making her way toward the mic.  This is where we ruin it.  This was a clip we played earlier.  It's something that could not possibly be aired on broadcast radio, because there are  rules and regulations the FCC has set up for broadcast radio.  It is...  Watch the reaction shot.  They're zooming in for the reaction shot as you say this. 
[03:25:00]  It's a clip.  Trying to make this sound good.  It's a clip of a gentleman with his lady friend in a closed bedroom, I would gather, alone,  having a little sexual encounter that involved a cordless Makita drill and a what would  be called marital aid, I guess you could call it.  In the old days, they used to call them marital aids.  We're keeping it clean for her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're gentlemen.  And it's the sounds of the drill and the guy coaching his girl and the girl enjoying 
[03:25:30]  the device that the guy had put together for her.  And wow.  It's something that could not possibly be broadcast on regular radio.  But that's what we're here for on satellite.  Is this a regular part of the new show?  No.  This is just something that popped up.  It's a clip that was made available to us.  It's nothing we do.  You know, hey, it's our weekly drill dough segment.  Although now you can play that and sound like we have a weekly drill dough segment.  But we don't understand how things are cut. 
[03:26:00]  Give us a week and it'll be a regular segment.  A weekly drill dough segment.  No.  And it's just something.  What we have is the freedom to broadcast stuff like that.  If it just becomes made available, we can throw it on.  We don't have to worry that it's going to get us fired or get an FCC fine.  And it's funny.  It's enjoyable to listen to.  It's, you know, it's one of those things that you're not going to hear on regular radio.  That's for sure.  It's fun.  She's horrified.  I understand.  That's the big interest. 
[03:26:30]  It's just, it's funny.  It's funny.  Yeah.  Was it funny?  It was definitely funny.  Some of the stuff she was saying.  Oh, yeah.  It was hysterical.  She was screaming things out.  It's a voyeuristic look, you know, into a couple's bedroom.  Really?  There was a comedic value to it, sure.  Absolutely.  She's yelling things out that, you know, were really funny.  You know, calling herself names, saying that she wanted to be called names by her boyfriend  at the time.  I guess the guy working the drill.  And it's funny. 
[03:27:00]  It is.  It's very voyeuristic.  It's kind of a look inside a closed bedroom, you know.  So that's interesting, I think.  I think it's something I definitely wanted to hear.  I thought it was entertaining.  The audience seemed to enjoy it.  Yeah.  They really did.  We got a lot of positive feedback on the phones and the internet.  I feel like a complete piece of shit sitting here now trying to justify this awfulness.  I feel like I'm in the principal's office right now.  Don't you? 
[03:27:30]  I have that same feeling.  I feel like she's the principal and we're getting scolded for what we do.  She's dressed all sharp and nice and everything.  You know, there was someone that was dressed just like her that fired us in Boston.  Yeah.  I'm having flashbacks.  I remember that.  Well, it's kind of a nice corporate look.  I'm just curious because it's not something that, you know, I haven't heard you guys.  I don't listen to Howard Stern either.  And I'm just, you know.  So it wouldn't be your cup of tea to listen to something like that.  Probably not going to wake up early.  No.  But the thing is, you see, you say something like that and then people get the impression 
[03:28:00]  that that's all we're doing.  The whole show is playing, you know, a girl moaning in the bedroom.  It was a, you know, four-minute clip that was really funny.  But that's just part of what we're doing here and part of the freedom that we get now  to broadcast things.  It's, you know, it's a piece of the show.  Yeah.  And it's, you know, it might not be your cup of tea, but people seem to like it.  That's why we're here because people do like it.  You know, you're not into, like, kind of peering into people's private lives a little bit 
[03:28:30]  and getting a little taste of what people do behind closed doors like that?  Not so much.  No?  And if I'm going to, at least I want to see it as well as hear it.  I don't want to just hear it.  Like the Paris Hilton video?  Have you seen that?  Actually, I haven't seen that.  No?  Oh, it's a great video.  See, that's another kind of peek into people's private lives.  People like butting their noses into other people's private stuff, you know?  And it's kind of fun.  It is.  I got to admit, I'm kind of into that, too.  Like, knowing what's going on and hearing people when they don't think they're being heard.  Stuff like that kind of intrigues me. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Doesn't get you, though?  Not really.  I think you're just saying that because I think that's basic human nature.  Because the cameras are all on.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's just part of basic human nature to kind of want to.  I know.  Turn off the camera and we'll get the real answer.  To kind of want to hear stuff like that.  But that's just, you know, it's part of the show.  Yeah.  What's the other part of the show?  You guys are on for, what, four hours?  Yeah, four hours.  Wow.  Like I said, we did do some talking about the debate.  You know, anything that's in the news today, talking about, you know, we were going to...  You're wasting your time. 
[03:29:30]  You're wasting your time.  Am I?  Yeah.  Should I just turn around and go, fight the power, man?  We like to talk about things in the news openly.  We like to talk about pop culture.  You know, the sports scores.  There you go.  But a girl is drilling herself as we do it, you know.  Yeah, when she's using the drill, though.  We like to spice it up a little.  That's a joke.  You got to turn on the drill, though.  This is not going to turn out well.  We were going to talk about how Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart's relationship is going.  Yeah, little things like that. 
[03:30:00]  How she's 39 now and ready to turn 40, and Harrison's going to, you know...  He's 62, and she wants a kid.  Trade her in like he traded that bag of sand for the golden head.  Oh, there we go.  Hey, she left.  Wow, Steve actually hit some music on cue.  Let it be known, Kelly from CBS News left.  Yeah, here you go.  Now they're making a new Indiana Jones movie, and he's 62 years old.  And I believe he's going to be playing one of the skeletons that fall out of the wall 
[03:30:30]  onto one of the characters walking by, because he's not...  He doesn't have that young, indie look anymore, does he?  You know, shit like that.  I'm sweating.  I know.  I know how this is going to turn out.  We know how this is going to end.  We've seen it before.  What do you think of Howard Stern going to series?  It's great for the industry.  Yeah, it really is.  It's a boon to satellite radio.  He's got 12 million listeners, and he does a good show. 
[03:31:00]  That's not the problem we have with him, and he's going to turn on a lot more people  to satellite radio.  Works well for everybody involved, except broadcast radio.  It's a coup.  Who's going to lose big?  It's a coup for the industry.  We were a coup for the industry.  Oh, is that a quote from Greg Opie Hughes?  Well, if the camera was on me, I would say it.  It's a coup for the industry, and yeah.  Yeah, I mean, we were a coup.  We got a lot of headlines when we moved over to satellite radio, and now with the announcement  that Howard's following us, Anthony. 
[03:31:30]  Following in our footsteps.  Following the pioneers.  That's also a coup, obviously.  She's horrified.  That's okay.  Girls have been horrified by our show before, Opie.  She won't be the last, that's for sure.  All right.  What other questions do you have for us?  I have a few.  What do you say to the people who scream about indecency on the airwaves?  They really need to get a life.  Yeah.  They have a choice. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, even on broadcast radio, it's gotten to the point where indecency, it's not even  indecent anymore.  Things you used to be able to say on the air, on broadcast radio, even a couple of years  ago, now all of a sudden are off limits.  It's just gotten so tight, the FCC doesn't even know where to draw the line anymore, so  they just impose these huge fines for the littlest thing that they deem indecent, and  they're things that usually are well within FCC guidelines.  We've had fines thrown at us.  No company's ever paid a fine on us, by the way. 
[03:32:30]  That's right.  But we've had fines thrown at us by the FCC for things that are completely fine and well  within FCC guidelines.  But now they're cutting back so far, because I guess they feel that's what people want,  because a small group of people make a loud noise, that they have to take it away from  everybody.  Millions of people that enjoy this type of radio, they have to take it away from.  So it's gotten so tight that people are scared to do anything on broadcast radio anymore.  And that's why satellite radio is going to just explode now, because there is an audience 
[03:33:00]  for this type of radio.  Like it or not.  You really think people are going to pay yet another bill for yet another subscription?  Oh my God, they're already paying.  They're already paying.  They're already signing up like crazy.  Yes.  If there's a demand for it, absolutely.  People will do it.  And there is a demand.  People are bored.  People are bored with regular radio.  People said that about cable television, too.  You know, people are going to pay for what they can get for free on broadcast television.  Well, you can't get entertaining television like The Sopranos and other things that are a  little more hard-hitting, a little more raw, a little more real-life conversation and dialogue in. 
[03:33:30]  You can't get that on regular television.  So people are paying for something they can't get for free.  We're like the HBO of radio.  Are we like that?  Sure.  HBO of radio without pictures?  Without pictures.  There you go.  But they are paying for it, yes.  Yeah.  Leaps and bounds.  They're coming on board.  Because the FCC and some of these small interest groups of people that think they're the voice of a nation are ruining it for everybody that is entertained by this. 
[03:34:00]  And they far outnumber the small groups of sticks in the mud, if I may use such harsh language, sticks in the mud, that think they are the voice of the nation.  You know, what they need to do is do their own parenting, be more aware of what their kids are listening to, and allow the adults in this country to be entertained as adults.  I'm not talking about putting porno on at all hours and just giving them free reign.  But there is adult-oriented conversation that includes adult-oriented subject matter without being pornographic that should be allowed, even on broadcast. 
[03:34:30]  I'm not even talking just satellite, even on broadcast.  And that's the stuff, if you want to keep your kids away from that, that's your job.  It should still be made available, though, to the people out there.  Well, I think the argument is you never know where it's going to be on.  So you turn on the radio, you're flipping through the channels with your kid in the car, and all of a sudden something pops up that you don't want your child to hear.  That's crap, too, because our show, when it was on broadcast radio, you know, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:35:00]  It got popular enough where people knew what it was all about.  They aren't tuning in thinking it's a news program.  They know it's an entertainment program aimed at adult men, and that's what it is.  They know, you know, you don't let your kid listen to it unless you think you can handle it and are fine with that, you know.  So, um, I'm not into the whole, I accidentally hit the radio with my elbow and heard this conversation.  You know, for a split second, you know what you're hearing, turn it off. 
[03:35:30]  They insist on keeping it on, listening to every word, and then bitching and complaining about it.  Do some parroting.  And saying how it damaged their child.  I don't know one kid that's ever been damaged by hearing something adult-oriented on the radio.  It just doesn't happen.  You know, they might laugh.  Uh, will there maybe be an embarrassing moment for a second between parent and child?  Might happen.  I'll even fess up to that.  But you know something?  That's life.  That happens when you're walking in Times Square and see a billboard or something like that, you know. 
[03:36:00]  It's, uh, it just happens.  It's part of life.  You can't get rid of it.  We can't put SpongeBob and Bob the Builder on 24 hours a day, and it's going to be a perfect nation because the kids are safe now.  You know, you'd have adults going shooting everybody going crazy.  So, you know, that's where I stand on that.  I think, uh, I don't think it's indecency going on out there.  I think it's, uh, it's people getting carried away thinking that everything is indecent.  Small group of people.  Really need mallets put over their head. 
[03:36:30]  I think she's satisfied with that.  Whew!  They won't use any of that, though.  I know.  They won't use any of that.  We need the patriotic music under that, uh...  They'll use this.  Fuck the FCC, man!  Yeah.  You just wrecked it.  I know.  They're going to use all those, and it's going to be awful.  At least the fans of the show will know what the real clips were.  Everyone else is going to be like, they're degenerate animals.  They need to be taken off the air.  Yeah.  How do we start regulating satellite radio? 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Do you think that's going to happen?  I, I...  If you air this, cut up the way we think you're going to do it?  Yep.  Oh, come on.  It will cause a movement.  Okay, I'll give you some credit.  But don't disappoint me.  I'll try.  Okay.  No, but seriously, do you think there will be a movement to...  Could you say, but X-Emily?  Oh, sorry.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm teasing, of course.  I think they're going to have a hard time regulating this at this point.  Yeah.  Especially with us, because you have to tell X-Emily Satellite Radio that you want the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:37:30]  Our listeners are paying an extra $2 to hear this.  To hear this mess.  Oh, my gosh.  It's subscriber-based.  It's very hard to regulate.  It's very hard to have that argument now that you accidentally hit it, and your kid accidentally heard it.  And I don't want this coming into my house or my car.  That was always a big thing.  You know, these are public airwaves, and I don't want it contaminating the interior of my minivan and the house.  Because you're paying for this.  If it's in your car, in your house, you know it's there.  And with our show, it's even more so, because you have to subscribe to this program. 
[03:38:00]  If you're stupid enough to get the system and subscribe to this and be offended,  then there is something wrong with you.  Please, step on the gas pedal and aim for that poll.  Because you're really screwed up.  All right.  Somebody wants to explain the show to the reporter.  You know, this is not a good idea.  Oh, letting the listeners explain?  Oh, my God.  We had complete control of this, Anthony.  Remember the last time we relinquished control of this program to another individual?  What happened?  We got two years off. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, we got canceled, and we sat out for two years.  Hedda, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  O&A, I want to explain to her what O&A is about.  I hope you can do a good job.  I don't get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to get a job, but I get up to listen to O&A.  It's like being on drugs.  I don't have any money, but I find money to pay for O&A.  That's all she needs to know.  We are drugs to the unemployed.  How about that?  You're performing a service.  Absolutely. 
[03:39:00]  We are drug dealers.  Thank you, Hedda.  Hedda, you described it perfectly.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Why don't you Hedda out and get a paper and get a job, you bum?  All right, we're going to step aside, take a little breather.  A little breather.  All right.  All right.  Did you get some good footage?  Oh, yeah.  Look at these guys.  They're so happy.  I know.  My boss is going to be really happy.  I got what they wanted us to get.  I was just kidding with, you know, the rock and FCC stuff.  Could you cut that stuff out? 
[03:39:30]  Thank you.  All right.  Go ahead, Steve.  We're screwed.  The only way you're getting a date is with a bottle of chloroform.  Because we used to have empires.  Oh, yeah, we used to.  Everyone had an empire.  France and Spain and Britain and Turkey.  The Ottoman Empire, full of furniture for some reason.  And the Austro-Hungarian Empire, famous for fuck all. 
[03:40:00]  All they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard.  And the German Empire, very Prussian, very organized, always building an empire.  Build an empire, build an empire, Einstein, Einstein, build an empire.  And then they'd celebrate with the World War and then lose the whole fucking empire by the end of the war.  Then the 30s, Hitler, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France.  Second World War, Russian Front, not a good idea.  Hitler never played Risk when he was a kid.  Because we know it was impossible to hold on to that Asia, Eastern Europe area, wasn't it? 
[03:40:30]  You know, in Risk.  You know, seven extra men.  We've all played it.  Seven extra men at the beginning of every go for that Asia bit.  But you could never hold it, could you?  Azerbaijan would fuck off somewhere.  And then fucking Siberia.  Come on, Ukraine.  Hang on there.  Fuck it.  Australasia.  That was the smart move, wasn't it?  The purples.  Get everyone on Papua New Guinea and just build up forces saying, 
[03:41:00]  Fuck off to everyone.  You'd never attack anyone.  You'd just get bigger and bigger and bigger.  Yes.  And I think America, because you're the new Roman Empire.  You know that.  Yeah.  There's no other big, you know, country.  You're the Roman Empire now.  There's no one else going, really.  China's there, big and large, but kind of, uh, and kind of...  They're just trying to do a bit of housekeeping at the moment.  And so you've got vomitariums and orgies to look forward to.  I think you've already covered orgies, but vomitariums are the future. 
[03:41:30]  Maybe that's in the bulimic area.  I don't know, but, um, because I get the impression that America, after the Second World War,  would really like to have built up an empire, but, you know, everyone else in the world would  go, well, you can't now.  We've just given that up, you know.  Email on the go.  I'm Kevin Eby with Chip Talk.  The ability to send text messages is a standard feature of most cell phones.  Now, one wireless company is out with a messaging device that eliminates the phone.  AT&T Wireless says it designed the Ogo for teens and young adults. 
[03:42:00]  Studies show a fair number of people in that age range have spent far more time sending  short instant messages than they do sending even regular e-mail.  The device is small.  It's only about four and a half inches by three inches, but it comes with a full keyboard.  There's a key for the letter S.  You no longer have to hit the seven button four times.  The Ogo service is compatible with most popular instant messaging systems, AOL, MSN, and Yahoo.  And it's also compatible with the full e-mail systems from those companies.  You can view your inbox and send and receive messages. 
[03:42:30]  The emphasis, though, is on instant messaging.  You can set it up so that it lets you know the moment your friends get online.  You can find out more at attwireless.com or at chiptalk.com.  I'm Kevin Eby.  singing in barber shops, rocking in dentist chairs, dancing in grocery aisles.

[03:44:00]  Just be one step, one step, one step, and I'm about to break.  I need a little room to break.  Cause I'm one step, one step, one step, and I'm about to break.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Uncensored on XM Satellite Radio.  There you go.  This is the serious part of the program.  We got CBS News in the studio, so we're on our best behavior.  Trying.  Trying to be on our best behavior, but they keep dragging us in.  Trying to give them the clips that they want and need.  We're trying to give them the sound bites, because we know how this is going to end. 
[03:44:30]  If CBS News does a good piece on Opie and Anthony on Satellite Radio, we know we're in trouble.  Yeah.  We know our show stinks, and we have no business broadcasting.  We get that.  Yeah.  Jesus.  But maybe they'll spin it.  Maybe they'll show some cleverness here.  We will see.  We will see.  And we will hear about it.  I know that.  From the bosses down in Washington?  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you guys take that interview?  What are you, stupid?  More seriously.  Why did you turn into the camera and say that? 
[03:45:00]  I didn't think they were going to use it.  Bye.  I'm a moron.  Yeah.  So.  Always screwing up somehow.  Well, they kind of wrecked our show by coming in here today.  Wrecked it?  Well, she's really.  Say that.  She's cute and nice.  She's a woman.  You know.  We were raised right.  Wow.  You are an observant guy.  We were raised.  She smells nice.  We were raised.  In this cave.  We were raised the right way by our parents.  Did it just smell like a locker room when you came in here?  Isn't that awful?  Just a bunch of guys just sweating in a room. 
[03:45:30]  Oh.  Well, the replay is going to happen in about 15, 20 minutes.  We did some really edgy stuff.  We did?  Earlier in the show.  Yeah.  Oops.  Don't listen to the replay today, okay?  Yeah.  Don't listen to the show.  Yeah.  Do us a favor and don't listen to the replay.  We were a little tired and we weren't thinking clearly.  Yeah.  That's it.  When Steve broke out that audio earlier of the couple and the drill dough.  Now they're getting the other shot from Opie's other side. 
[03:46:00]  Yes.  And now I got the straight on view.  Isn't it a shame that they can't get the picture of the VU meters anymore?  You know those little stick meters that they show on every single broadcast of every single radio story?  You got to zoom in on the board.  We don't have those anymore.  It's the future.  I have a digital one on a computer monitor.  Kelly, are you done?  Are they just like rolling B-roll now?  Oh, she got it.  Is that it?  You got what you want?  She got what she wanted.  Did you get a golden nugget? 
[03:46:30]  Who else have you spoken to about satellite radio?  Anyone good?  Anyone else?  You guys are the experts.  Yeah.  Well, we are the pioneers, Anthony.  We invented it.  Who, who, who?  No management or anything?  Did you speak to management?  I guess we spoke to John Madden.  I didn't personally, but apparently we did.  John Madden just wanders around my neighborhood in between games.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Eats at the same Chinese restaurant.  He's on the cell phone.  He's a miserable guy.  Really?  Oh, my God, yeah. 
[03:47:00]  I see him almost every day.  What do you have to say about satellite radio?  Uh, I'm not sure.  I haven't heard the interview.  Oh, okay.  Didn't do it myself, so I don't know.  I know that he listens to, he must listen to XM, yeah?  He does.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he doesn't fly.  Yeah, because XM satellite radio is the better of the two companies.  He definitely listens to XM satellite radio.  No, he does.  Nice sell, Opie.  Good one.  All right.  Now I'm completely distracted.  I know. 
[03:47:30]  I don't know.  What would you guys be doing if I weren't here?  Well, there was a girl that was going to come by to say hi to the whiffle ball bat.  Was she here?  There was a couple of girls in a bathroom in Cleveland that wanted to say hi to us.  Oh, yeah.  Just some of our fans checking in to say hi.  Checking in from various locations around the country.  You're really a buzzkill, man.  I got to tell you.  You're cute and all, but this stinks.  We had Earl from our old job.  Yeah, we don't want you filming, Earl. 
[03:48:00]  No.  Not at all.  Look at him just sitting there on the set.  He's calling someone else.  You think it's you, Opie?  Probably.  I think he's calling you like he does 24 hours a day?  Probably.  So, you know, the show came to a screeching halt, but I'm sure this will look good on CBS News this weekend.  When is it running?  It airs tomorrow night.  What, Saturday night?  But it's...  One in the morning?  Only on the West Coast.  Only on the West Coast?  It's a West Coast show, isn't it?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's because of sports on the weekends.  We have a West Coast evening news show tomorrow. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, it's only on and no one's going to be able to see it?  They'll see it on the internet.  On the internet?  All right.  You guys got enough footage.  We thought this was a national interview.  Damn.  How's my family supposed to see this?  Thinking I'm actually somebody.  Sorry.  She still thinks...  I'm now really a buzzkill.  My mother still thinks I'm just playing with my friends doing this.  It's like, why don't you get a real job?  My mom was listening and she goes, the new show is a little dirtier. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, I know.  I've had to deal with that, too.  She's like, you guys are really funny, but it's a little dirtier.  Yeah.  I didn't know you could curse on satellite radio.  Ugh.  I haven't even talked to my mother yet since we've signed on to XM.  You're scared of that phone call, right?  I know what it's going to be.  Because she asked me, she's like, oh, could you get the satellite radio and hook it up?  Because I want to be able to listen to your show and I want to hear the first show and  everything.  And I did all that knowing damn well I was going to be dreading that first phone call  to her. 
[03:49:30]  Because she's used to hearing the broadcast show, which at that time she was like, you  know, there are some things I shut off I don't listen to.  And it's like, okay, great.  You know, I have to parent my mother.  Don't listen.  That's not a break for you, mommy.  And now she's got the satellite, so I can only imagine the horror of some of the subject  matter we've covered.  How about on Monday we call her and get her a review?  Oh, we could do that.  We could call her and have her review the show.  That would be great.  I'm sure she loved the break about fever junk. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  It would be much more exciting than this.  Yeah.  I'll give you that much.  And we lost Bit of the Week.  We were going to play Bit of the Week.  How did we lose Bit of the Week?  So we could leave on a funny here, but Steve, do we still have that?  Oh, you'll love this.  The entire worst of folder that we've been putting best bits in is gone.  Gone.  Yeah.  Thank you, DC.  That's great.  We see, we still have technical glitches that we've been working on for the past week. 
[03:50:30]  It's kind of, this is one of those newfangled studios, they call it.  We think Oompa Loompa guy outside.  You ought to get him, you ought to do a new story on him.  He's not even human.  He's leaving.  If you are wise, you'll listen to me.  We think there's forces here working against the program.  People that worked here before we got here that aren't happy with us coming on board because 
[03:51:00]  it's not their brand of radio.  And we think that they might be sabotaging the show.  Sounds a little paranoid.  I realize that, but just too many things have happened.  I think the guy that runs Frank's place, plays like Frank Sinatra music, he doesn't like  us at all.  And I think there's a little sabotage going on.  Yeah, what happened?  He just doesn't like what we're doing.  And we kind of wheel in here.  We took over the studio.  We took over the office thing.  And, you know, they've been coming in here for a couple of years now. 
[03:51:30]  And, you know, I'm sure we kind of stepped on a few toes to get in here.  And now he's all pissed.  So all of a sudden things disappear off the computer, off the console.  Buttons get changed on the board.  It's a constant battle when you're the dregs of society and, you know, people don't really  like you.  Yeah, we don't make friends wherever we go.  No.  Hey, let's play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  It was an educational show today, I think.  This could have been on PBS, this program today.  It was so educational.  The last hour, certainly. 
[03:52:00]  This could have been on broadcast radio because we're too nice.  Daniel from Alabama.  I learned today that Opie doesn't think Clint Eastwood is hot anymore.  And Oompa Loompa steals everything.  Jaiselle from Niagara Falls.  I learned that Steve is finally getting the tunes on cue.  George from Philly.  I learned two things.  The O&A show is like a topless Clint Eastwood movie.  And Opie likes a finger every once in a while.  Yes, of course.  Rob from Chocolate City, Washington, D.C.  I just learned O&A are drug-dealing whores who think the FCC is the devil. 
[03:52:30]  Is that funny?  That was pretty good, yeah.  Kyle from Albany.  I learned that Opie's junk is cleaner than my hand, and Anthony got a cold from giving  an Arab a handjob by proxy.  I didn't.  Oh, well, we were talking.  See, earlier we were talking about the importance of washing your hands for good hygiene after  you use the bathroom.  That's a good tip.  Big story today about those bathroom slaves, the people that are in the bathrooms, and  you've got to toss them a buck, and it's like extortion.  And we found out, you know, Opie, for one. 
[03:53:00]  Did you shake hands with Opie?  No.  Yes.  Opie, for one, doesn't wash his hands after he uses the bathroom.  And you shook his hand.  Now, see, I'm embarrassed.  See?  Now you should wash your damn hand.  Now I'm turning red.  And I was getting crap, because I wash my hands every time.  Every time.  And I use the paper towel after I dry my hands to open the bathroom door.  Why is she wiping her hand on her pantsuit?  That ain't gonna help.  Don't do that.  Dip your body in alcohol. 
[03:53:30]  See?  See?  Now you made her feel bad.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  Wash.  But that's a break, you know, that I think was important to get the message out there.  I can't even say it with a straight face.  Yeah.  You do know you ruined our show today, right?  I get that sense.  The last, you know, the last 20 minutes, I would say.  People are checking us out for the first time, and they got to hear this.  This drivel.  Doug from Boston.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey. 
[03:54:00]  I learned today that Ann's quote on CBS Newsreel is going to be the small group of people that  don't like it should have a mallet over their head.  Yeah, I think that we should have a contest to see which quote is used.  Yes, because perish the thought someone gets a cartoon mallet over their head.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.  You hung up on him.  I know.  Let's go to Rob.  Hey, Rob.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I learned today that the broad from NBC.  CBS.  CBS.  It's a young lady.  Pardon me.  The young lady. 
[03:54:30]  That's right.  The young lady from CBS is a voyeur who wanted to see the drill doe live and hope he should  enter his mule in a 4-H contest with the other animals.  The queen is born out there.  Very nice.  Let's go to Dan.  Hey, Dan.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, man?  How bad did this hour suck?  A little bit.  A little bit.  We were rocking, too, man.  Yeah, man.  We had things we were going to do that we're not going to say in front of the fine lady.  No, that wouldn't be a problem.  Hopefully the wiffle ball bat will come into play on Monday. 
[03:55:00]  We had something called the showstopper that we won't be able to do now.  Dan, what's up?  Today I learned a new use of my Makita drill.  Yeah?  I'm a black girl looking for a stapler.  Very good, bro.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You suck.  All right.  Steve, how much time do we have left?  You've got two and a half minutes.  Get us out of this uncomfortable mess.  Why don't you finish up with that?  I don't know what we've got.

[03:58:00]  All right.  Welcome to the opening and end.  Sigh, you son of a bitch!  Sigh, you son of a bitch!  I love New York City.  Oh, yeah.  New York City.  I love New York City.  Oh, yeah.  New York City.  I went to Cancun for vacation about a year ago. 
[03:58:30]  Made a big mistake while I was down there.  I loaded up on jalapeno dip and chili. 
[03:59:00]  Wash it down with a gallon of Mexican water.  Yeah, before I went parasailing.  Oh, umbrella rentals were up at the beach that day.  Hey, honey, what kind of birds are these?  What the hell is that?  What is that?  A Scud missile?  Like, ah!  Nobody told me Cancun is located a quarter mile from the sun. 
[03:59:30]  First day on the beach.  I don't need that sunblock.  I'm no pussy.  Give me the butter.  Two minutes later, my friend's like,  Hey, you smell pork burning?  I knew I bought the wrong sunblock on the bottle.  Had a picture of a black guy putting two white guys out with a fire extinguisher. 
[04:00:00]  I knew I screwed up.  They needed dental charts to find my shorts, you know?  I think those are hit.  No, that's got a red ribbon on them.  He don't like them.  You guys, you go on vacation to get peace of mind, don't you?  That's where I go.  Does it ever work out that way?  I'm trying to take a nap at the pool,  and the Creighton family shows up with 14 kids, ages 2 to 3.  For the next six hours, I have to listen to Marco Polo. 
[04:00:30]  Marco Polo!  Marco Polo!  Marco Polo!  Marco Polo!  I jump in the pool.  Can you teach me to play?  Drown three of the little kids, you know?  Two-minute lady here.  Marco!  Hey, where's Billy?  He's in the deep end taking a nap.  Leave him alone.  Like I'm trying to.  I met a bunch of cute girls at the pool in Cancun,  so I went running out there like a hero  and did a one and a half into two inches of water. 
[04:01:00]  Drove my skull into my neck,  and I looked like Ed Sullivan getting out of the low end.  I'm going to go have my spine fused.  Have a good night, ladies.  I met some girls from Europe at the pool.  I could tell they're from Europe  because they didn't shave their bikini line.  That's not a pretty sight on a woman, is it?  This one lady looked like she had buckwheat 
[04:01:30]  and a scissors lock.  Somebody lost a toupee.  It's in her shorts.  She took her pants off  and Burr Reynolds' head fell on the floor.  I'm telling you.  Sold.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  You're welcome. 
[04:02:00]  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  Thank you.
