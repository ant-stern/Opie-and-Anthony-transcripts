<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about Angela, a woman featured in an HBO documentary about Bellevue Mental Hospital.  The hosts initially mocked Angela's behavior shown in the documentary, but their tone shifted to sympathy after a call from someone claiming to be her father (later revealed to be deceased), followed by a call from Angela herself.  Angela explained her hospitalization stemmed from depression following her father's death, and that she didn't remember being filmed.  She threatened legal action against HBO and Bellevue, prompting the hosts to offer her NSYNC tickets as an apology.  The segment then transitioned to a listener complaint about a Napster song allegedly plagiarizing Stephen Lynch's "Hermaphrodite," which the hosts played for comparison.

Professional wrestler Mick Foley joined the show for an in-studio interview.  The discussion centered around his book, "Foley is Good," its surprisingly short length (compared to his previous work),  and anecdotes from his wrestling career, including near-death experiences, accidentally using a wrestler's real name on TV, a brutal Hell in a Cell match, and a "penis suplex" gone wrong.  He explained his fondness for Winnie-the-Pooh attire in interviews, analyzing the dysfunctional nature of the Pooh characters.  Foley also used a lengthy, explicit sex toy analogy to illustrate his point about book length.  Listeners called in with questions about his career and book.

Following Foley's departure, Paul Mercurio from *The Daily Show* became a guest.  They discussed Lewis Black, upcoming shows, the *Daily Show*'s future syndication plans, and the Opie and Anthony website’s "whipped cream bikini contest."  The hosts also promoted their upcoming "WOW road trip," involving a sticker distribution campaign and live broadcasts from a tour bus.  Numerous commercial breaks featured ads for Sobe beverages, Worldwide Monkey, Vermont Teddy Bears, and concert tickets.

A later segment featured a lengthy and explicit discussion about bestiality, sparked by a *Time Out New York* sex advice column letter.  This led to numerous anecdotes and jokes, along with listener calls sharing their own experiences or knowledge of bestiality. The conversation frequently veered off-topic, covering various subjects: Craig Kilbourne (and negative experiences with him), Bob Costas (and criticism of his demeanor), *The Daily Show* (including praise for Stephen Colbert’s guest hosting and criticism of Jon Stewart's perceived change), a costly lunch at the Brooklyn Diner and a Joe Torre encounter, a derogatory description of an older gay man, Psycho Mark's roommate (an older gay man), the Robert Blake murder investigation, and several urban legends.  Paul Mercurio remained a guest during this segment,  and Psycho Mark and Big Kev also called in.  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed was advertised repeatedly.

The show continued with humorous anecdotes—a tick-infested bike ride and Viennese police dealing with overweight corpses—followed by giveaways for God Smack and Deftones concert tickets and listener calls, some critical of the show. Opie discussed his "sports curse."  A segment promoting BMW Films and their short films followed, along with a Sam Adams beer sponsorship and the news of the XFL's discontinuation.  Further discussion of Angela from the Bellevue Hospital documentary occurred, with audio clips played, and Angela again calling in.

A "What Did We Learn Today?" segment highlighted humorous and offensive listener observations.  The show concluded with a farewell to an intern, Kelly, more listener calls, discussion of the "WOW Road Trip," a Radiohead listening party ticket giveaway, and an upcoming skating event. The broadcast ended with a brief, sexually explicit audio clip.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Uh, who is this?  Opie and Anthony.  This is the worst radio I've ever heard in my entire life.  Makes no sense.  Trickery to white devils.  Verbal diarrhea.  Verbal diarrhea.  You guys are making me assy stink over here.  This stuff is terrifying, man.  I think people that call radio stations are, uh, losers.  Opie and Anthony.  Bringing out the best in it, people, today.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:00:30]  I hate this place.  The meditations don't work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  They re-ran that special last night, Anthony.  Yes.  The Bellevue special on HBO.  This place blows.  I've been here for seven years.  And it turns out one of the girls featured on that, uh, special.  Yes.  Uh, listens to our radio station.  Radio show. 
[00:01:00]  Uh-huh.  And she called Rick, and she was kind of picked off at us.  Oh, I think she wants to, um, come on our airwaves and say that she's not crazy.  Which is fine, you know.  It's an open forum.  Why not?  Where's Rick?  He took the phone call.  I guess it's the daddy girl, right?  Yeah.  Uh, Angela was her name, wasn't it?  Angela.  The girl with the dark hair, who is constantly pissing off the one with the glasses. 
[00:01:30]  Well, we'll have to get Rick in here to tell the story.  But she wants to call in the show and tell everyone that she's not crazy.  Sucks to be her, though.  She's featured on a Bellevue Mental Hospital special on HBO.  Yeah, because then everyone's going to think you're crazy.  If you're on, if you're in Bellevue, people are going to think you're crazy.  If you're in Bellevue on a special on HBO, and they deemed your story good to focus on,  out of everyone in Bellevue, they're going to think you're uber crazy. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, I mean, imagine if Ken Stevens was on the Bellevue special.  Well.  And then he's walking around the halls as this big, huge exec for Viacom.  You're like, no, you're the crazy guy from the Bellevue HBO special.  Well, read the New York radio message board.  They think he is in Bellevue.  Ken Stevens.  And there's a, sometimes I agree.  I think Ken Stevens is insane myself.  You still read the New York radio message board?  Very rarely I go on and read it. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, I've given up on that message board.  I have no time for closed-minded apps.  I pop on, read it.  Like the first post or two might be a discussion you might want to read into,  and then it always turns into, this personality sucks, and we rule, or we suck,  and certain personalities rule, and it gets ridiculous.  Right.  Rick, so Angela called you?  Angela called me, yeah, about 25 minutes ago.  And she wants to call the show today? 
[00:03:00]  She wants to call in and give her version.  You know what?  She's got to show up.  I would love to have her on the show.  She's got to show up.  She's going to call up and say that she's not crazy.  She can't make it in because she's on Venus right now, Opie.  She's calling from Venus, but she'll be back soon.  You're going to ruin it, you know?  Are you kidding?  If she's not crazy, then she understands we have sense to you.  Rick, why are you cringing?  This is what makes good radio, to make fun of her and say how crazy she is,  and then we have that fun conversation.  Not making fun of her. 
[00:03:30]  We're discussing what we saw on the special.  Now, if she wants to come on and explain that there's more to her than just what was seen on the special,  I'm all for it.  She was crying over her dead daddy.  Right.  Is she listening right now?  What?  Why is it over here?  Opie, stop it.  Now, I saw the special, and it was kind of touching when she was getting emotional about her father.  It's like, get over it, man.  I mean, jeez.  Crying over your dead daddy.  Opie, please, now, the girl wants to come on. 
[00:04:00]  Just think, the daddy could be alive today if she knew CPR or something.  All right.  Why is everyone leaving?  All right.  Enough.  What happened?  Enough.  This is what we do, right?  We have fun.  What the hell were you thinking?  She's on the line already.  No, see?  All right, I got to go get some coffee to prove how much of a puss I really am.  Where?  Let me make sure it's her.  They hung up on her.  Swear to God, Stinky wrote Angela down, and then it hung up.  Maybe because you just heard that last bit. 
[00:04:30]  No.  Look, you got to give everyone a shot.  If, you know, the HBO special portrayed her in a certain way.  Wasn't her?  And she wants to come on.  I'm all for it.  I encourage it.  She said she had a little bout with depression and stuff, and that's why she was in Bellevue.  Right.  She said she had checked herself in.  And now she's fine.  And she showed not the whole story.  Right.  So she wanted to fill in the blanks.  And she said she'd be an easy lay.  Well, I see. 
[00:05:00]  Now, that's some of the stuff.  I mean, if I'm going to hell, I'm bringing my pal with me.  That was some of maybe the things that HBO portrayed inaccurately, Opie.  And if she wants to come on here and say that no, indeed, she would not be an easy lay in Bellevue.  I'm all for her coming here and giving her some.  You know, I'm the guy.  I'm the guy.  If I'm going to, like, commit suicide, I'm going to make sure I hit someone on the sidewalk.  Or if I could grab someone on the way down, I'm going to do it.  You're coming with me, my pal. 
[00:05:30]  Look, okay, I might have said some things.  You said she's an easy lay.  I said she may be an easy lay based on what was portrayed in the HBO special.  If she wants to come on here and talk about it.  Think about all the action you could have with that one.  And I was talking generally of chicks in mental institutions.  I think they would be easy lays.  You're going to say I'm wrong?  Easy lays, but they'll follow you for the rest of your life.  Just wear daddy's clothes.  What was daddy's cologne? 
[00:06:00]  I'll put a little of that on.  No, see, Opie, stop that.  I didn't do nothing.  I was schizophrenic.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What the hell?  I think you were supposed to keep me on.  All right, thank you.  Our first call of the day, and a banner call it was.  You know, you guys are featured in our Brills content interview,  and that guy just made us all look like tools.  We'll talk about that later.  Chris, what's up? 
[00:06:30]  Hello, Angela.  You need to call and straighten this out.  There's nothing wrong with you.  I'm here for you.  Are you claiming to be Angela's dad?  Yes, I am Angela's dad.  Angela's dad passed away.  No, he did not.  Angela's mom passed away.  Drop dead right in front of poor Angela.  Don't bring that up like that, Opie.  Now, we want to talk to her, and you're going to reen it.  Everyone knows it's, you know, breathe twice, pump three times.  You're going to reen it. 
[00:07:00]  You know, this girl went into Bellevue because of depression.  She's out now.  She's working.  Right, Rick?  Yeah.  You got the info?  She's working.  She feels fine.  She's been okay.  But how hard is it to keep someone alive that drops in front?  It's very hard regardless of if you know CPR, my friend.  Pull the tongue out a little bit.  Make sure there's nothing in the way.  Breathe three times.  Pump three times.  Breathe three times.  Pump three times.  If that was the case, nobody would die.  It's all good.  It doesn't happen, and she should feel no guilt about that. 
[00:07:30]  It was just, that's what happened.  Why not?  It's her fault.  All right.  Well, Rick.  Rick.  I hate this place.  The medications don't work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  So, Rick, why did she call?  You want me to get her on the phone now?  Yeah.  Yeah, we might as well.  We're talking about it.  I mean, see if we can get her on the phone.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Opie, how you doing?  Doing well.  I just want to thank you for jinxing Toronto yesterday. 
[00:08:00]  Go Devils.  Look at that.  Well, I appreciate you guys acknowledging the effect I could have on some of these sporting events.  All right.  10-10 on the end, back Diamond Dust.  I haven't picked a winner in over a year and a half.  It's good, though, if you take the opposing teams like that.  Yes.  And, of course, I love how the fan always gets flack for not covering Devils hockey.  You know that?  You ever hear that?  Every year, it's the same thing.  Like, they just go into break, and it's like,  Mac and a man, Doc and a fan, let's talk about hockey.  The Devils, I think they wear skates. 
[00:08:30]  Let's move on to baseball.  Sick.  Because they don't know hockey.  They get all, and then the hockey fans get all pissed off.  Like, there's the premier, supposedly the premier New York-based sports programming.  And they don't know hockey.  And they don't talk about hockey at all.  Let me go to Rob real fast.  We're getting Angela on the line, by the way.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  How's it going?  We're doing well.  You know, the other day you were talking about how Russ Salzberg is doing some ridiculous  things on his newscast? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, he does his sports with Monica Pellegrini, and they put him in silly positions sometimes.  Last night, he was skipping like a fairy through Central Park.  Stop it.  Why was he skipping, though?  Because it's supposed to be some new exercise.  See, he gets skipping is going to be a trend.  Yeah.  He gets talked into this stuff, and he does it, and he looks completely ridiculous.  Guys, you should have seen him.  All right.  What a tool.  Thank you, Rob.  Take care.  Bye. 
[00:09:30]  Hey!  Skipping.  Let's go to Joe.  Waiting for Angela.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  If Angela comes in, I think all the sharp and blunt objects should be taken out of the studio.  I want her in studio.  Ah.  Well, look what I see down on the hotline.  All right.  We got to go, Joe.  Speaking of rules, guys.  Speaking of the devil.  Angela.  Angela's on the line.  All right.  Let's welcome Angela to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Angela.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you?  I can totally tell by your voice. 
[00:10:00]  This is you.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  A couple of friends of mine told me that I was on your show last night.  Well, we were discussing your appearance on the Bellevue special on HBO.  Yes.  You know, of all the specials that HBO runs that you could be a part of, the Bellevue special  is probably one you really might not want to be part of.  I would like to be part of real sex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  That would be nice.  So, how was it that you were in there and they featured you pretty prominently in that 
[00:10:30]  special?  Okay.  Well, first of all, I didn't know I was being filmed, number one.  How was that?  All drugged up.  Oh, good.  But the camera was right there and everything?  Well, she was all drugged up.  I don't remember it.  That's what I'm saying.  Wow.  And did they have you sign a release, all drugged up?  Even if they did, I don't remember it.  I smell lawsuit.  Yes, because that's what I'm doing right now.  As we speak, I'm having my lawyer look into this for me.  Oh, there's an exclusive.  Wow.  Laws suit.  So, the thing is, is that I admitted myself to the hospital and, you know, with confidential, 
[00:11:00]  you know, they make you sign papers saying that they're not going to, you know, you can't  release this on, you know.  Right.  On HBO, especially.  You know, that makes perfect sense because if you're in there.  That's what I'm saying.  You're going through some problems and if you're doped up.  It's especially when you see a therapist and they can't repeat what you're saying to  anybody.  Right.  Even if you tell your therapist, oh, I killed somebody, they can't repeat that to anybody.  And how can they take a release that you signed when you signed it if you're doing drugs?  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  They got a lawsuit. 
[00:11:30]  That's what I'm saying.  We're trying to sue right now.  We're trying to sue HBO and Bellevue.  And the director of that program, I have her name and everything.  So why did you check yourself into Bellevue for that?  Yeah, what was going on?  I was surprised.  Yeah.  That's it.  Why were you?  Because you broke up with a boyfriend you had for a while?  It was reasons for that, yes.  That's true.  I don't know if I meant it.  I didn't even see it yet.  It was on last night again and my friend's tape said I'm going to watch it too.  I tell you, you were the cutest nut in the fruitcake.  I got to tell you.  Oh, that's why I called you.  I just wanted to clear my name because I'm not a nut. 
[00:12:00]  Well, we got to go over a little bit, Angela.  It was a little strange to see you dancing around with the picture of your father.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Yeah, that was a little.  It was actually touching, though, Aubie.  I got to say, it was.  Well, the thing is that when I'm not in the hospital, I do not act like that.  When I'm in the hospital and they drug me up, they put me on so many drugs that you don't know what you're doing.  Well, let's explain what you'll see when you finally see this on Instagram.  You didn't have a bra on. 
[00:12:30]  Your boobs were looking very nice.  Oh, my God.  No, I'm serious.  A little nipple action happened.  Oh, my God.  You were crying uncontrollably.  Oh, my brother's not listening.  Holding a picture of your daddy.  Yeah.  My dad passed away six years ago.  Yeah.  And that's why you kind of were depressed.  Yes, I get, yeah.  Yeah.  On and off depressed about that.  How long ago was that take?  That take must have been about two and a half years ago.  Two and a half years ago? 
[00:13:00]  It must have been, yeah.  Oh, they take that a long time ago.  Yeah, two and a half years ago.  Now, who was that, you know, the chick with the glasses?  I don't remember anything from there.  You remember nothing?  Nothing.  Do you remember that?  My friend called me at work and she told me, you were just on HBO last night.  I go, what?  I was like, for what?  I don't remember being, you know, filmed for anything.  She was like, no, remember when you were in the hospital?  You told me.  I was like, yeah.  She was like, well, you weren't HBO.  I was like, ask for the Sopranos?  I was like, oh, my God.  Like no one was watching. 
[00:13:30]  Do you remember this guy?  I hate this claim.  What guy?  The medications don't work.  I hate this claim.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  Remember that guy?  No.  You don't remember that?  He was yelling in the hallways.  I don't remember.  It was hysterical.  Every day he would roam the halls saying that.  I have no idea.  Now, Angela, what's the story with your dad?  He died right in front of you?  Yeah.  Yeah, because you talked about that on the show.  Yeah, I was very close to my father.  Yeah.  I mean, you know what?  He looked like a party guy.  He kind of looked like Rodney Dangerfield. 
[00:14:00]  He was very, yes.  He had a very good sense of humor, my father, yeah.  It looked like he liked to tip him back a bit.  He was very cool, my father.  Party guy?  Yeah.  Well, not party, but he was a gentleman, but he had a good sense of humor.  So what was going on when all of a sudden he just dropped?  You know, he had a massive heart attack.  Oh, yes.  He was good for a while, and then it happened out of nowhere.  Were you guys, I don't know, watching TV?  I mean, what was going on?  He was in a nursing home at the time. 
[00:14:30]  We brought him upstairs, and he just asked for his wheelchair, and he just died.  Oh, so they were not doctors around.  They were just some of the nurses from the nursing home.  They didn't know how to do CPR.  Yeah.  It's just crazy in itself.  And you say on the special, on HBO, that you wish you knew what to do.  Exactly.  Now I do.  Because you say?  Now I do.  I'm a personal trainer, aerobics instructor.  You are?  Yeah.  Oh, you're probably a...  I'm my medical assistant.  You're probably in good shape.  After all that, I became, you know, knowledgeable of everything. 
[00:15:00]  You know something else you're going to love, Angela?  I'm right now on the HBO.com website, and when you click on the Bellevue special, your  picture prominently displayed on the front page.  Oh, yeah.  It's you with your arms crossed.  That's when you were dancing.  Why did they keep...  Kind of hugging yourself.  ...dancing on me, especially.  Because you were like...  Because you looked normal.  But you were just like kind of talking like you're all drugged up. 
[00:15:30]  But that one woman with the glasses...  Tell me what the thing is on the computer.  It's like, go write it down and look it up.  Oh, it's HBO.com.  Just click on the Bellevue.  HBO.com.  And what is it?  The Bellevue special?  Yeah.  America Undercover.  America Undercover.  Are you still on medication right now?  Yeah, you're doing any meds?  No.  No?  Really?  I only...  Just a little weed.  A couple of times I was in the hospital, it's the only time I was on meds.  Really?  That's the only time.  I mean, I've been seeing a therapist for the past year.  Yeah?  I've been doing great.  I haven't been depressed or anything.  Well, you know what you've got to do? 
[00:16:00]  You have to come in on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we'd love to have you.  Okay, sure.  I'd love to meet you because you seemed like you were the fun one in there.  Okay, yeah.  I swear to God, that one girl with the glasses was like always jealous of...  You, because she thought the doctor had the hots for you.  Oh, my God.  I've got to see this tonight.  I can't wait for...  Don't we have some audio?  Do we have audio?  Rick, get some audio because we pulled some audio from the show.  Are you good?  And if you want to hear some of the clips of what she was saying about the doctor and 
[00:16:30]  you...  Oh, my God.  That's so funny.  Like, this girl's freaking out and you just poke your head in front of the camera and  go...  Oh, my God.  I've got a confession to make, though.  Angela, this is Opie speaking.  I was going to rip into you really bad.  You seem way too cool.  Yeah, I am.  I just can't do it.  I have children, too, so please don't.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, I have a 15-year-old and a 9-and-a-half-year-old.  Wait a minute.  How old are you?  I'll be 33 this year.  33.  And you have a 15-year-old?  Yeah.  Let me do some math.  I'm not a young. 
[00:17:00]  Holy Jesus Palomino.  Right.  When I was 18.  Where was she when you were in the hospital?  She was with my mom.  Oh.  And my mom pretty much raised my oldest daughter.  You want to do, like, a mother-daughter thing for NSYNC tickets?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  My daughter loves NSYNC.  Yeah, when she's just coming in, we should give her NSYNC tickets.  Oh, God.  All right.  You know, she was in Bellevue, for God's sake.  What more do you want her to go through, Opie?  She was in Bellevue.  My daughter's birthday is coming on the 20th.  She would freak if she had NSYNC tickets.  You know, we could just call it, you've got to be a nut to want to go to NSYNC. 
[00:17:30]  I'll take it then.  I don't care.  You know what?  Anything for my kids.  If Angela comes in, we'll give you a pair of NSYNC tickets.  You will?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Thank you so much.  What happened to us?  We went from ripping into you to giving you, like, yeah.  We turn into pussies when girls are involved.  I know.  It's really a shame.  All right.  Hold on.  I was hoping you'd be, like, you know, out of your mind.  My brother listens to you guys.  He's a truck truck.  He loves you guys.  I love the truck.  I have to say hi from my brother Michael because he loves you guys.  All right, Angela, we've got some audio.  Yeah, listen to this. 
[00:18:00]  This is Cheryl, the crazy lady with the taped-up glasses that look like Bubba Ray Dudley's sister.  Bubba Ray Dudley.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, and what part is this?  This is where she's yelling at Angela, who's on the phone, about, you know, about how the doctor wants to bang her.  Yeah, the doctor's trying to get them to make up after the fight.  Yeah, I guess you fought.  Oh, my God.  You fought with this girl, or she fought with you, and you were trying to, like, hug her and say, hey, man, things are cool.  She didn't want to hug you, and then she's like, you know, they want you.  You're the hot one.  Oh, my God.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Okay. 
[00:18:30]  I can't make up.  Yes, you can.  Come on.  I don't want to make up with her because she got me in trouble.  You're a forgiving person.  Not when I was tied down and thrown in a can and again and seduced in a way camera.  That was a long time ago, and we're going to have to forget about that and work on now.  And you think she's so pretty that you want to seduce her, don't you?  No, I don't.  You look good.  You have the hots for her and everything.  I don't have the hots for anybody. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God.  This is hysterical.  And you have no recollection of that?  No, not at all.  Because that was done, like, right in front of you.  I was drugged up on lithium, valium, you name it.  Nice.  Wow.  I was so drugged up.  I had no idea.  Like, what's the first recollection you have of coming out of that drug-induced haze?  I have a little recollection near the end of when they transferred me to a different hospital  in Staten Island before I went home.  Yeah.  That's the only recollection, like, of coming out of that.  Were you ever on the streets or anything? 
[00:19:30]  No.  No?  Man, you're just getting really normal.  I know.  I'm shocked.  I'm waiting for the lady with the glasses to call and go, hello.  I have an actual job and going to college.  I completely believe you.  Yeah.  But now the thing is, with the HBO special, you're nut number three, you know?  Really, no one really knows this around the country.  Yeah, yeah.  The best on one of these clips is, Angela, you actually lead everybody after this girl  can't get what she wants to say out.  You start a chant of happy birthday to freak her out. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Out of nowhere, she's freaking out, and you just start going, happy birthday.  Do you?  Do we have any of her clips, though?  Not just her clips, though.  That is so funny.  Yeah, it's something.  I'll have to look.  We're going to have to get you in here, though.  Okay, I'll definitely come in.  Here's you singing happy birthday.  Okay.  All the kooks to sing happy birthday.  Okay.  We're getting pizza, which we never get, hardly ever.  All we get is mashed potatoes. 
[00:20:30]  We don't get cold, though.  This isn't a diner.  I know, that was the second time.  I know, lady.  I don't even remember that lady.  Oh, she had the taped-up glasses.  That is so funny.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  Well, I am definitely suing HBO in Bellevue, I tell you.  My mother, I was speaking on the phone with her.  She was like, sue the radio station.  I was like, no, I love those guys.  Sue the radio station? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my God.  I was like, no, I would never do that.  I like those guys.  We're definitely going to give you NSYNC tickets.  Chill out.  Yeah, jeez.  What the hell?  You know how moms can date.  Right, very overprotective.  This really is an exclusive.  Angela was on the HBO Bellevue special.  I don't mind if you mention me.  But she doesn't remember being taped or anything.  No one asked for her permission.  And it looks like you got some kind of lawsuit under you.  Yeah.  Again, I'll say it.  Definitely.  The only impression we had of you was that we saw on the HBO special. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  And like...  Of course, that's going to portray a different, you know...  Yeah, if we imagined speaking to you on the phone, we would have imagined like...  Or something, you know, not somebody who's carrying on a normal conversation.  We got a guy on the line that works for an insane asylum.  He says, Angela, when she goes in, she signs away her rights.  I don't know about that.  I don't know if that gives you permission to be on HBO on a special.  Who said that?  A guy that works... 
[00:22:00]  He works at one?  In one of them, yeah.  Well, when you go in and you sign yourself in, it's not signing away your rights, which  you're just signing yourself in for a rest, and you're telling, you know, you're just  signing like a paper saying that you're going to be in there for a certain amount of time.  You're signing to the Holiday Inn for a rest, Angela.  You're signing to that for some dope.  Well, the only thing is, is that if you tell them, like, when you're signing in that  you were ever suicidal, it becomes almost an involuntary thing. 
[00:22:30]  I've been through that also, but not at that place, but at a different place.  Now, I remember, I was watching the special.  I saw a couple of patients in there that had their face blurred out.  So, obviously, they didn't consent to it.  That's what I'm saying.  And even if I signed the paper, I don't remember signing it.  Right.  I don't even remember anything being filmed or anything.  That's how abhorrent I was to the whole thing.  You stick to that story.  Your daughter will go to the best school around.  Oh, God, I hope so.  We have a psychologist. 
[00:23:00]  We have a very talented young lady, both musically inclined like me.  From singing of Happy Birthday, I could tell.  No, no, I play piano when I'm a dancer.  Uh-oh, where do you dance?  Oh, I was teaching her to dance.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  That's all she needs.  It's like, is there a pole where you're dancing?  There's no pole where you're dancing, right?  No, there's no pole.  I was teaching children for a while.  God, you're still funny.  She seems like a really nice girl.  Actually, you seem more normal than 90% of the women that call this goddamn show. 
[00:23:30]  A psychologist is on the line that says you have no case.  It was a documentary.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, so you call something a documentary and it gives you a carpelle on you?  No.  I'm just throwing it out there, Anthony.  It's not right because say my friends, actually my daughter's friend's mother saw it and then  my kids are getting embarrassed and, you know, I'm basically embarrassed right now.  My family saw it, my friends saw it and they're all calling my mom.  My mom is being, you know, embarrassed as well.  Oh, Angela, it was only on after The Sopranos, not a good lead-in. 
[00:24:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Why doesn't The Sopranos, he's a crazy person running around like, everybody was like, you  look crazy, but your hair looked good.  She's like, why couldn't it have been on after August?  My friend knew that my hair looked good.  I was like, Angela, you looked fine.  Oh, at one point you, like, you put your hands on your head and you go, oh, look at my  hair.  I look like pebbles.  I'm 15 pounds overweight right now, but I still look pretty.  You know what?  We got to get the clips of Angela.  We're going to try to find the HBO special so we can play some clips for you later. 
[00:24:30]  We'll call you back if we find them, okay?  Great.  But here's you.  Is this the one leading the rest of the kooks in happy birthday?  This is not the kids.  This mission is for the health of the people.  What I'm trying to say is that you...  What I'm trying to say is that when people are in pain and they need help, let me talk,  please.  I know, I know.  Please let me talk, God damn it. 
[00:25:00]  What I'm trying to say, I can't take it with her.  Let me talk.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  And they all follow suit.  Oh, God damn it.  Boy, you sure defused that situation.  Angela, you were driving her nuts during her special. 
[00:25:30]  She hated you.  This woman hated and loved you at the same time.  That is so funny.  She was over here screaming.  I just thought breaking out.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  And you don't remember that either?  I have no clue.  I don't remember her.  That is pretty funny, actually.  If my father was alive, or wherever my father is, he's laughing right now.  Happy birthday.  I wish we had the clip of you.  Happy birthday.  I wish we had the clip of her dancing.  I'm surprised I didn't sing it like Marilyn. 
[00:26:00]  That would have been even funnier.  Well, when she comes in, or maybe later, if we find it, we can give you a call back.  But can we put you on hold, and Rick can get your info and stuff?  Definitely.  If he doesn't have it, and hammer out a date where you can come on the show?  Definitely.  Yeah, cool.  Come down for the NSYNC.  Okay, no problem.  Angela, it's been a pleasure.  Thank you so much.  All right, hold on.  Okay, bye-bye.  There she goes, Angela from the Bellevue special.  What happened to her?  Man.  She sounds like a completely normal girl.  Boy, you know something?  I got to say, she got a lawsuit there. 
[00:26:30]  She absolutely has a lawsuit there.  Someone has got to drop off the HBO special.  We have it?  Oh, we got it.  Who's got it?  There it is.  Rick said he couldn't find it.  I think he found it.  I think he found it.  Hold on, get Angela back on the phone.  In about an hour, we'll get clips of what Angela was doing on the special and get her reaction, okay?  Angela.  Hello?  Angela, it's Opie and Anthony.  We got you on the air again.  Okay.  We just found the HBO special.  Okay. 
[00:27:00]  And we're going to get some clips together of what you were doing.  Okay.  And we want to get your reaction live on the air.  Okay, sure.  We'll call you back a little later, I guess.  Yeah.  Okay.  Within an hour, all right?  No problem.  All right, talk to Rick again.  Okay.  Rick, we need that immediately.  Yeah, she's got some lawsuit there.  You know, because it's one thing to have a documentary, but it is in Bellevue.  It's somebody that signed a consent form under the influence of drugs that they were giving  him at the hospital.  You know, I'm no lawyer, but I hate him. 
[00:27:30]  I hate lawyers, but I don't know.  What?  That sounds like a pretty viable suit.  There's an O&A exclusive.  There you go.  Wow.  And we'll play the clips.  She'll be hearing it for the first time, what she was doing during this.  She's going to be pretty embarrassed.  She may even cry.  Maybe.  I was waiting for Ben to find a Napster daddy's home, the song she was dancing to.  Let's go to Carolyn real fast.  Carolyn.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:28:00]  That was pretty cool.  And this coming Sunday, it's like little JonBenet beauty contestant kids.  Yeah.  So maybe if that's a couple years old, you can get some of them on the phone, too.  Oh, I saw that special.  Yeah, that one's a couple years old.  When that first came on, it's all special on the families that take their little kids  around like JonBenet in these beauty pageants, and it's disgusting.  They're just despicable parents.  I'm sure.  The reason I was calling is because, I don't know if my ears are playing tricks on me, but  I swear I heard Stephen Lynch's tune this morning. 
[00:28:30]  You know, we didn't...  Please give Stephen a little more credit.  We're getting a lot of email on this.  Someone is completely ripping off Stephen Lynch's hermaphrodite song.  It's hermaphrodite, is the song.  But they redid all the words.  It's an acoustic version.  We got the version on Napster, right?  Do we?  There's one of the versions.  We ought to do it back-to-back and listen to the music.  It's ridiculously a rip-off.  The whole attitude of it is Lynch.  Now, Lynch is pretty much...  He's very original.  His sound, what he's singing about, the music, because he's an accomplished musician. 
[00:29:00]  The guy's a great guitarist.  And what you might have heard this morning is just a bad imitation of Stephen Lynch.  It's kind of sad.  It really is.  When you think about it, really.  Apparently, it's a little kid, but, you know, it's still, you know, theft is theft.  Well, when people are pushing it like it's great and it's nothing but a pale comparison of the original, which, you know, Lynch, and you hear him on this show, it's ridiculous. 
[00:29:30]  And it makes it even more ridiculous when you put it into the context that it's in.  And that's all we can really say.  Yeah.  And I also heard the term instant feedback.  That one's amazing.  That one's just...  And you know who started instant feedback today?  Who?  Imus.  Imus.  Everyone is picking up on the instant feedback phenomenon.  Instant feedback.  I used to call that heartburn.  Instant feedback of what I ate.  I'm puking all over my cowboy bandana, baby. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  Carolyn, thanks for that.  You're welcome.  There's a few other things like ruin and reenit, the hay, the Marco hay.  I mean, but what are we going to do, Al?  What are you going to do?  Start going into a rip-off tangent or, you know...  It would be so nice.  That's all I can say.  It would just be so nice.  Three weeks and counting, ladies and gentlemen.  Are we ready to play that song? 
[00:30:30]  Give me one second to find it.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Napster.  This is about all the stuff you find on Napster these days.  All the crap.  Unless you put in Tamalica.  Oh, I know.  They're even on to that.  Napster dropped off like 49%.  That's all record companies wanted.  Yeah, that's it.  As long as it took a big hit.  You ready, Rick?  All right.  Here's the song.  Here's the pale comparison of Stephen Lynch.  It's done by...  You'd be the judge. 
[00:31:00]  And remember him after Dite.  Well, we're going to play it after this.  Listen to the music.  Holy crap.  In the mornings as she walks through the door  I'll be the pimp, yeah, and you be the whore  Might be a curse in here.  I'll start the grace when I see her in the halls  More so and more so when she got my balls  The man for Ditey.  Yeah.  I mean, give me a break.  This is done near the one 
[00:31:30]  You make my fantasies oh, so much fun  When I see her far into a rage  I really don't care  You're terrible at my age  Oh, fingers stuck in the strings  People think I'm weird  Some say I'm sick  Because I wouldn't like her to suck my...  Nice  Oh, then what?  Oh, it goes anyway 
[00:32:00]  I'll be a preacher  But I'm not  I'm not  After an English teacher, yeah  Oh, an English teacher, yeah, yeah  A lot of people think I am a creep  I'm not a stalker  I just like to be  She sits up high and heard a green Toyota 
[00:32:30]  Oh, hold up  He just said the F word  Mrs. John, yeah, you're the one  You make my fantasies oh, so much fun  When I see you, I fall into a rage  I really don't care that you're at my age  Oh, Jesus  All right, listen  All right, enough  That's pretty much it  First of all, the song blows  It goes on for like four and a half minutes 
[00:33:00]  And people are saying  Because I'm reading this now  On instant feedback  Hey, it's a 14-year-old  It's a kid that got kicked out of school for the song  It's about his teacher  I don't care who the kid is  Or if he's ripping off Lynch or anything  It's just the forum that he had to play this song  The forum that was used to play this song  This morning  Presented it as this unique, original thing  That's all 
[00:33:30]  And it's a blatant  I mean, obviously the kid's very influenced by Stephen Lynch  Jesus  I guarantee he's got Stephen Lynch's hermaphrodite  Here's the original  All right  He's probably listening right now  He probably is  But here's Stephen Lynch's hermaphrodite  This is  This is  This is  Well, whatever  Just listen  She's parts girl  She's a very boy  She's got parts  Everyone can enjoy 
[00:34:00]  She's got more  She's got less  She's got her manhood  Tucked in her dress  Yeah  Is she a mister  Or is she a miss  Little girl  She's my little guy  When I try to please her  I get poked in the eye  She wears lace 
[00:34:30]  And she wears flannel  She watches football  And the Lifetime Channel  What's that bulge  Under her nightie  It's just my  Hermaphrodite  Yeah  Hermaphrodite  Some things are white  Some things are black  Some girls wear makeup 
[00:35:00]  Mine shaves her back  She is still beautiful  She is still fine  It's too bad her package is bigger than mine  Yeah  She looks like Cher  But she's built like Sonny  She loves Brad Pitt  And finds her three stooges funny  Who's that girl  With the grip so mighty 
[00:35:30]  It's just my  Hermaphrodite  Yeah  Hermaphrodite  Hermaphrodite  Daggie  You've got to be kidding me  Yeah, you've got to be kidding me  You don't write that without the experience 
[00:36:00]  There you have it  Wow  If that's not obvious  I don't know what to tell you  Al, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right, Al  Original  They're allowed to say whatever they wanted  They can, but it's not going to get through  It ain't going to get through  Basically, no, Al  It's not an original  We just proved that point  And I had no idea  I was actually impressed this morning  Listening to that effing show  And then  Look at what you guys bring up 
[00:36:30]  All right  Thank you, Al  Thanks a lot  Believe me, I toil over how I can talk about certain things  Look how I got to talk like a friggin' moron  And then, you know, that guy obviously got slammed  Just showing how unoriginal that other song really is  That's all  That's all  And if situations were reversed  Oh  You'd just hear about how we suck 
[00:37:00]  That's right  That's all  Anthony, we've got to take a break and move on with the show  Because Mick Foley  Hey!

[00:39:30]  Yeah  This is a thrill for me  You know, I'd heard you guys  Were kind of Foley fans  And I hate to disappoint you  But seeing as how well  The Chris Jericho as Fozzy  Refusing to break character  Interview went  That was great  I just want to be known as  The Dude while I'm here  The Dude?  Yeah, I do love talking to you guys  The Dude love  Yeah, it's not  Did you hear  You heard about that interview?  I was in the worst traffic jam  In New York  You know, and on the way  To Long Island  And I heard almost the whole thing 
[00:40:00]  And you guys are telling me  Hey, look, we love Chris Jericho  We want him here  We don't want this  Moose McQueen  Mildred  Mildred  Mildred  Yeah  And I'm like  Chris, for crying out loud  Just break character  He wasn't budging  He was not budging  We were so frustrated  With that  But we had a good time with him  Because we goofed on the whole thing  And then Triple H  We had a great time with  We had Triple H  Spankin' girls last time  You're kidding me  Any girls I can spank here?  Oh, come on  Where's a girl he can spank?

[00:41:00]  And there were like  Blood vessels broken  On her ass cheek  We were a little disturbed  With that one  And we enjoyed it though  Yeah  She seemed to want it  Anthony, a Long Island boy  I know  Warren Melvin  We were going at it  Outside the studio  Because Harborfield's  Ward Melville  Big rivalry  Basketball rivalry  And that was 81  I believe  Right  And they beat us  They beat Harborfield's  That year  And we had Brett Barrett  All-American Brett Barrett  On the team  I was too busy  Smoking pot 
[00:41:30]  In my high school  John H. Glenn High School  Which I think  Were the champion pot smokers  Back then  You guys could argue  Your basketball  But  Well, his father  Was the athletic director  For Ward Melville  But you didn't really  You played a little  What, lacrosse?  You know what?  There was like a rule  I had to play three sports  As a sophomore  Like my dad thought  Making me play sports  Was perfectly understandable  Yeah  And I love sports  But I mean  I played football  And it was like  You know  I said in the first book  That my problem was 
[00:42:00]  I wasn't a good team player  And like  I don't want to get  I mean it's one thing  To get in front of  20,000 people  And understand  Okay, this is going to hurt  For a while  This is going to hurt for a while  But to get hurt  On practice  So when they'd go  To pick teams  I'd conveniently bend down  To tie my shoelace  And then when it came to  Basketball  I'd just want to sit back  And put up 20 footers  And I played lacrosse  But I was a goalie  Which is cool  Because you've got  The pressure on you  And it really wasn't  Until I wrestled  My senior year  I was like  Yeah, this is it  You know  I mean 
[00:42:30]  It doesn't feel so good  To be pinned in front  Of all your buddies  And the whole school  And lose the meat  For the team  But at least it's you  Out there doing it  There's probably somebody  Still out there  Just going  Yeah, I kicked Mick Foley's ass  Well, there's a lot  Of people out there  And your dad must have  Been rolling his eyes  Going, Mick  Get off the roof  You're not going to  Have a career doing that  That was a little bit  Later on  Yeah, yeah  When he started  Jumping off the roof  Full mass apparently  Yeah, really  Well, I want to read this  On the air  Mick Foley doesn't know  I'm going to read this  This is from  Which book was this from? 
[00:43:00]  Well, if you read it  No, I was asking  So, okay  You'll know  Because I've read both books  Okay, thank you  And I like both books a lot  You're talking about  Foley is good  My new book  Which is available  Very good  Look at that  Very good  And you're doing  Some signings, right?  Yeah, I'm good  Get that out of the way  Let's plug that  Let's get it out of the way  I'm going to be at  The WWF New York  Tonight  It says from 5 to 7  And I'll be honest with you  I'm not even going to  Pretend that this signing  And all these signings  Aren't important to me  And so  Pretty much if you show up  Even if there's a big line 
[00:43:30]  And I am hoping  There is a big line  Because if I'm not  You'll see a grown man  Cry like a baby  Right after WWF New York  It's a big line  Don't worry  Because I'm going to sign  Until everybody's book is done  And that's  Today from 5 to 7  Then we go to Stony Brook  Only about 10 minutes  From where I grew up  Tomorrow at Borders  From 7 to 9  Or until whenever  And then Saturday  I believe  Let me check my cheat sheets  From 5 to 7  On Saturday  At the media play  In Poughkeepsie  He was saying  Outside the studio  That he has to write  Things down  When he goes into the ring  So he can remember 
[00:44:00]  Oh really?  Well you know what  Like I don't  They don't usually  Write things for me  And you know  The first like  14 years of my career  We never had any  Like scripted interviews  And it was that last year  I'll admit  When they started going  With like the 25 minute dialogues  You have to know  What the other guy is saying  Or else it's just a big mess  But this time  You know  I was going out there  For the first time in a while  I'd been off TV  For a little bit  And I had a bunch  Of stuff to say  And about 5 minutes into it  I just drew a complete  Oh no  Like a big time one  And the crowd was  Chaining fully  Like it was a strategic pause 
[00:44:30]  But after about  45 seconds went by  And no one was  Chaining my name  I mean  I was  I was literally  I was one second away  From just saying  Look  Vince  You know  Vince is supposed to  Come to the ring  I'll be honest with you  I don't know  What I'm talking about  So maybe you guys  Ought to just come down here  And we'll try to  You know  Suspend their disbelief  In a couple minutes  And the thing was  What I was supposed to do  Was plug my book  So it's like  I forgot the most  Important thing of all  But I do keep  A couple key words there  And I look down  I'm looking at  Rikishi  You know 
[00:45:00]  I'm looking at  Like single words  And I'm like  None of this  Is ringing  It was downright ugly  I was probably  Back  Backstage  Just going  Oh my god  He's lost his mind  He doesn't know  What he's going to  Talk about  See I thought  All that stuff  Was scripted  All the way  But you guys  Kind of  Just go with the flow  And make it up  As you go  I was doing the ad lib  Like I said  Anytime there's five  Or six guys  In the ring  At the same time  Chances are  They've gone over it  But even then  We were shocked  Edge was in a movie  Called Highlander  Part 7  I think  Was it 
[00:45:30]  Yeah the last one  Highlander 4  And they had  What's the guy's name  The little guy  The star of that  I didn't see that one  Christopher Lambert  Used to be Lambert  And he was there  And they handed him  Like two sentences  To say  You know  And he wasn't  Trying to be snotty  Or anything  Or be a big star  But he looked at it  And he goes  Maybe if I had a week  And meanwhile  We get these  Like pages of dialogue  And my mother  Asked me one time  She's like  How many days  In advance  Did you get  I said days  I said I got that  15 minutes 
[00:46:00]  Before I went out  You know  The guy's trying  To remember what to say  And the amazing guy  Is Kurt Angle  Has like a photographic memory  Like he looks at  Three points  Repeats it verbatim  You know  God damn  I can't remember  Commercial reads  Without the copy  I sit down  Those tongue tied  So here's a quote  From one of the  Mick Foley books  I'm not sure  Which one offhand  I find the whole  Talk show experience  To be a little odd  Oh yeah  This is really good  Meeting people  You barely know  Or have never met  Acting like good friends  While the cameras roll  And then sitting awkwardly  During commercial breaks  Then the commercial ends 
[00:46:30]  And bam  You're best friends again  Hey it's true  This happens in this studio  Hey and I'll go out here  And I'll say  You guys both came out  And we were talking  During the commercial break  So I can't say that  About you guys  But I mean  There was  You know  I kind of rag  On Roseanne  A little bit  In the book  But it was like  Here's this woman  Making millions of dollars  And her producer  Comes up to me  And says  Now look  We've got some questions  We wrote for Roseanne  But she's not really good  At asking questions  So if you could maybe  Try to get her involved 
[00:47:00]  In a conversation  You know  She's good at that  I said  Okay I'll try  And then she said  Look we put together  Some really good clips  But Roseanne isn't really good  At remembering to call the clips  So if you want your clips  To be seen  You better call them up yourself  And I'm thinking  What the hell  Qualifications are necessary  To be a talk show  You're hosting the show  It's unbelievable  I stumbled out of there  And they were like  Bowing down reverently to me  Just because I'd made it  Through the show  It was horrible  We've got to take a break 
[00:47:30]  Really fast  But before we do  Foley is good  Is the new book  You've got to tell Anthony  Your theory about Pooh  I was trying to explain that  To him in the back office  Do we have this time  Do we have a couple minutes  To talk  Oh yeah  Alright  If anyone  Is anyone  A real big wrestling fan  In other words  A guy without a girlfriend  They're a real big Foley fan  If you go back  And you look in the archives  Almost any mainstream media interview  Like a 2020 or the biography  You'll notice one constant 
[00:48:00]  That is  I'm wearing Winnie the Pooh clothes  Really?  And my theory is  It's never been scientifically proven  But to me  It's just a common sense thing  You're facing a lot of times  The mainstream media  Looks down on the wrestlers  Or they don't like you  And they want to be confrontational  You know  Because we're a little bit controversial  My feeling is  If you want to be mean to somebody  And you look down  And there's that  Chubby little cub  All stuffed with bobs  You can't quite do it  You know  And I'm like  I wear this stuff all the time 
[00:48:30]  I like it anyway  You know  A nice gentle little guy  You know  Makes up for the fact  That I'm ugly  And puts people at ease  But that's true  I have utilized Pooh  My Pooh theory  And then I go later in the book  Or right after that  And talk about how really  We're supposed to look at  Winnie the Pooh  Like this is a tremendous family  Living in the woods  And really they're a bunch  Of dysfunctional idiots up there  The whole Pooh family  It makes sense  Don't you read the book  We take flack for being violent 
[00:49:00]  And then being inconsiderate  And I'm looking like  The original Winnie the Pooh movie  If you remember  Pooh was stuck in Rabbit's hole  His living quarters  I'm talking about  Right  For like a week  Because no one would dig him out  It was like Rabbit  He wouldn't go  He wouldn't get him out  And they made Pooh  Basically starve himself  Until he could ease himself  Out of there  You know  They didn't even put  A little Vaseline  Around that hole  Or something  And I'm thinking  These people are cruel  Rabbit's an anal  Retentive neat freak 
[00:49:30]  Right  Yeah  Owl has a serious  Superiority complex  Tigger is like  The guy with the speech impediment  He's really just out for himself  Totally narcissistic  And then what I said  About Eeyore  I said  He's not even manic depressive  He's just depressive  All the time  And I believe  Something that's never been touched on  Is that I believe Eeyore  I'm going to state it right here  Probably Eeyore is a homosexual  How the hell is that?  Well look  How does the guy  Put on his tail?  With a nail  He gets nailed in the butt 
[00:50:00]  Doesn't he?  He gets nailed every day  Every episode  He's getting nailed in the butt  Yeah  And then Christopher Robin  You know  Well he's got the socks  A little too high  A little too high  And the loafers  And Pooh basically  Has been without pants  For 30 years  And I got a Christmas book  Yanked from thousands of stores  And one of my elves was naked  And I'm like  Look at this guy  The second  If you're completely naked  Like Little Bear  You know  You're just being natural  But the second Pooh  Puts on a shirt  It means he's at least  Cognizant of the fact 
[00:50:30]  That he's supposed to be  Wearing clothes  And he chooses not to  There you go  God damn brilliant  I've never heard it  Quite put that way  Alright we've got to  Take a quick break  If you want to talk to  Mick Foley  212-757-1027  The book is really  Really good  I loved the first one  I was telling him  Outside the studio  I read it on vacation  Of all places  Let me nail your ass  With my hammer  You're on me  And of course  The second book  Which is out now  Foley is good  He's doing a book signing  At the WWF restaurant  Pretty much right after 
[00:51:00]  He finishes with us  And Opie let these people know  I actually write these books  You know  Nobody helping me out  I do it by hand  I can tell  You need an editor  What do you say  I go on a little long  You know  On the train today  I was reading  Because I'm up to  The part in the new book  Where you handed in your book  Right  The book is like this thick  The first one  It's like war and peace  Really  And you bitch and complain  Because Tuesdays with Maury  Was only this big  Should I share my sex toy theory 
[00:51:30]  Or should we come back  And I can under  You can keep  Go ahead  I can read Bramley  My theory is  Alright now  This goes back  My theory is like  A book with Tuesdays  With Maury  He heard this  And then he was really  Did you read the book  Yeah I read it  And it's good  I got a lot of flack  For reading it  But is it really that good  I mean if it was 500 pages  Would you have read it  No  Would anybody have read it  No  Alright the reason that  And let's  You know I'll give credit  Where it's due  It's a good book  And it's  I mean it's phenomenally successful  My last book  Was on the bestseller list 
[00:52:00]  For 26 weeks  You know  I'll be happy  If this one  Squeaks on for one week  This book's been on  For like 180 weeks  But the reason  I come up with  Is that  He's obviously drawing  A lot of people  Who don't usually read  Hear that it's good  And then they see  That they can knock it off  Like in an hour and a half  You know  You know a big book  I say  Is like  It's like  A big book  Is like going out  With a girl  Every day  Having to spend  Quality time with her  Buying her dinner  And not even having  A guarantee  You're going to nail her  At the end of the relationship 
[00:52:30]  It's like  You know  You don't know  How the book's going to end  You're not going to  Really like it  And so what I thought  Automatically  Is when I was in Montana  On a wrestling tour  In like 1987  Right after I graduated college  We're out in the middle of nowhere  And a bunch of us  Go to an adult shop  And we're kind of like  Thinking you know  We're going to be smart guys  And we say  Excuse me ma'am  Can you tell me  What your most popular dildo is  And she  You know  We're looking at these things  That are just a potpourri  Of some of the most massive members  You've ever seen in your life  And she brings us over 
[00:53:00]  To this little tiny thing  That it looks like  Something my mother  Used to take my temperature with  And she says  This is  This is our most popular model  I was like  What the hell  You know  Why don't they just use me instead  You know  And I said  Well why  And she goes  Well most women  Using a sex toy  Have never used one before  And they find it  To be less threatening  So I  What I say  And now Mitch Albom  Will probably rag on me again  As I say  You know  Well Tuesdays with Maury  Was the less threatening dildo 
[00:53:30]  And mine was like  A baby's arm  Holding an apple  Yes  Yeah you have to  Commit to read your autobiography  But it's really really good  Alright  More with Mick Foley next  And we're going to  Play some commercials  And sit here awkwardly  For a few minutes  So stay there  And we'll be best friends  We'll come back on the  Opie and Anthony show  I mean you're never going to amount to anything  It's awful  It's awful  Very very offensive  It's a little bit straight to the airwaves  I cannot believe that those morons are on the air  I don't know Anthony  I think this is better than a rock block  Don't you?  Only half is nauseating

[00:56:00]  I've been looking when this show is dirty  1027 WNEW  And we're hanging with Mick Foley today, Anthony  From the WWF, of course  Yes  He's got his second book out called  Foley is Good  That's true  And he's doing a book signing right after  He leaves us in about a half hour  20 minutes or so  I'm running over there  But can I reiterate, Opie, to these people  That, you know, if you get off work at 5  And you're worried about there being a line  Don't really worry 
[00:56:30]  Because I intend to be there late into the night  Yes  I'm supposed to host Smackdown  But really, if there's people online  I'll run in and do my two minutes of hosting duties  And run back out and sign some copies  Can we bring you some beer or something later?  Later on  You know what?  This has been a long day  You know, I'm not much of a drinker  Which is good  Because I get buzzed on one beer  Yeah  But I could probably go for that one beer later  Later this evening  There you go  There you have it  Can I mention a few other things from the new book?  Yeah, feel free  That I enjoyed  Will it help me sell copies? 
[00:57:00]  It should  You better believe it  The writing is  Is really, really good  Very entertaining  Very funny  A lot of comedy in the book  Here's something we talked about  When I told everyone I was reading the new book  Baseball managers  That wear uniforms  We went off on that  Yeah  What's the deal?  I mean, doesn't anyone have the guts to stop  And tell them how foolish they look?  Don Zimmer, from what I understand  Is a wonderful human being  But he has got to be the stupidest looking guy  In that outfit  I mean, I took some batting practice 
[00:57:30]  With the twins a year and a half ago  And I looked  I'm not saying I didn't look bad in that outfit  You know, I mean  I looked really bad  But, you know  Zimmer  And then they tried wearing the warm-up jacket  To cover it  And it's like  Guys, please  You know  Like I think I said  You know  You're talking about middle-aged men  Wearing tight spandex outfits  Obviously meant for younger people  Right  Kind of like the WCW main event stars  That would always look so bad 
[00:58:00]  With WCW  Especially if you would switch back and forth  When they were on at the same time  Obviously  I've got to tell you  The reason I switched from the spandex  I wore the real great vibrant brown color there for a while  There was a segment  There was me, Rock, and Ken Shamrock  In a three-way cage match a few years ago  And it was a good cage match  And me and Rock were up on top of the cage  They got this area like for lighting or gridding or something  Where you can actually sit on top of the cage  And we were throwing punches  Which was cool  We were way up in the air 
[00:58:30]  And then when I stood up  It was like the lights were shining in such a way  On the back of my tights  And it was just dimple after dimple after dimple  And I was like  Oh, God  It doesn't even matter  I came off the top later  I mean  I had a hell of a match  You know  The only thing people remember is that I  You know  I was like an acid  It was a Swiss cheese that backed into a belt sander  It was hideous  So right after that  I went with the sweatpants  Cool  We got a few people that want to say hi  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, Nate  You guys are the best 
[00:59:00]  Oh, thanks  What about me, man?  Mick Foley, man  You're a hardcore icon  That's all I got to say  You're perfused with like  Sabu  You're legendary  You're the man  Thank you very much  Can I point out  I'm going to admit the mistake  You guys passed me a note here  Saying  Saying that  A fan had called  It says  Was Mick aware that he had used  William Regal's real name  Steven  This past Monday night  I'd say after my performance on Monday  That was the least of my problems  Well, that's what Joe wants to ask 
[00:59:30]  Are you going to be wrestling again?  Right, Joe?  Yeah  I was going to ask  When are we going to see you in the ring wrestling again?  You know what I'd like to do  Is maybe  I've just got a barometer here  To feel  Would people want to see me wrestle?  I don't know  Well  Oh, we'd love it  I would think so, yeah  You know what?  If it was really done under the right circumstances  I would definitely think about it  And the right circumstances  Meaning they were going to pay me a lot of money to do it  There you go  You know, there is a part of it  You know, it's like  It's like what  The percentage of people 
[01:00:00]  Who would look down on me  For breaking my word  And coming out of retirement  Would be somewhat minimal  Especially when you consider  That the average wrestling retirement  Lasts about six weeks  You know, I've gone about 60 weeks  Which makes me  I'm like Abraham Lincoln of the wrestlers  You know  What a man of my word  What does your wife think, though?  And the kids  You know, she was really, really  For me, retiring  And then when that stock market  Started spiraling down  Out of control  I was like  Nick, you think you might want to do it  I'll throw it in  We lost a little in the text 
[01:00:30]  See, I didn't realize  How much you guys got hurt  Yeah  I mean, I wasn't stupid  And thought, you know  And thought like a lot of people  That wrestling is completely fake  I knew you guys were taking bumps and hits  But when you read his autobiography  It's insane how hurt you guys get  On a weekly basis  Well, a lot of that stuff  Was, happened  A lot of the major injuries  Happened before I was in the WWF  But back when I joined  In the end of 95  We were still on the road  Quite a bit  And so like  Something like a sciatic nerve problem  You'd never had time to heal it 
[01:01:00]  And it would just get worse  And worse and worse  And now at least  They have a schedule  That's somewhat  Some semblance of sanity to it  You know, the guys are on  Four days a week  And they're off three  So if you really watch yourself  And, you know  And take care of yourself  It's not that bad  It's still difficult  And I mean, you know  Then you'd throw in  Your personal appearances  And the travel days  And when you add all that up  You're still kind of working  About 300 days a year  But at least you don't have  As many matches  As you used to have  Well, like the chair shots  So, I mean, that is  Yeah, you know  If I had it to do  All over again 
[01:01:30]  I think the one move  I would have perfected  And since it's radio  You really can't see  But it would have been  Like that quick  Throwing my hand up  To block the steel  Yeah, that everyone does that  Coming at high speeds  To my head  And now a lot of people do it  And you don't hear anyone  Go, ah, he threw up his hand  I think most of the fans  Would deep down  Like to know, all right  You took it right  To your forehead  Yeah, I was a little dumb  I mean, I had that going for me  Hey, Mick Foley  Doesn't put up his hands  And they're like  Mick Foley's an idiot  You know  What the hell  I mean, all the guys  Now are putting up their hands  And no one thinks  Anywhere of them  You know  What do you think  Of Beyond the Met 
[01:02:00]  With your wife and kids  In the front row  I mean, it's been  Well documented  Yeah, yeah  I mean, unfortunately  They managed to catch  My worst parental decision  You know  On film  It's like, you know  We're basically talking  Where he got beat up  Pretty good by the rock  And hit, what, like 17  It was 11  It felt like 17  11 chair shots  Of the head  In front of his wife  A lot of blood  Wife and two small kids  While he's pretty much  Handcuffed to the ropes  Yeah, I was kind of helpless  And I didn't gauge  I didn't take into account 
[01:02:30]  How much more  The shots would hurt  You know  When my hands  Were behind my back  Because it really does  Take your body  Out of its natural alignment  And I mean  That first shot  Just came in  And I said in the book  You know  I mean  The tough guy part of me  That like one  You know  One percentage  That is a tough guy  Refused to go down  On one shot  I went down  On that first shot  You know  It put me right down  On my knees  But the thing is  I mean  I've had a lot  Of good moments  As a parent  But you don't  You really see  My father son  Talks on  Right  In a movie  You know 
[01:03:00]  I made a mistake  The match got  You know  The match got  A little out of hand  You know  I was a little  Too into my role  The rock  I think  Was getting off  On bludgeoning me  A little bit too much  And you know  I mean  Made for a great movie  But I didn't really know  My kids were that upset  Because when I got to the back  They were like  Over it by then  Right  And then when I saw  Their reaction  The shots  I was like  Ooh  Somebody's a bad father  You know  Yeah  Oh man  That was awesome  How is the rock  To deal with these days  Now that he's in  One of the biggest  Grossing movies  Oh you know 
[01:03:30]  I haven't seen him  Since then  You know  Really  I would imagine  He should be feeling  Pretty good about himself  You know  The rock's a pretty  Down to earth guy  Yeah  Everyone seems to get  Along pretty well with him  You know  He doesn't have his own  Dressing room  Or anything like that  Although if I was in his shoes  And my movie did  70 million the first  First week  I wouldn't want to be  Changed without snow  You know  That just doesn't  Doesn't seem fair  I love the house  No abuse  We were talking about  Movies that wrestlers  Have made in the past  And you know  The rock had a great  Part in this  It was limited 
[01:04:00]  It was  You know  Limited yeah  It was limited  But it was  It was an important role  I'd say you know  In terms of importance  As to what  You know  The movies did  For a wrestler's persona  That his  Mummy Returns  Is just slightly  Ahead of my turn  In big money  Hustlers  Or how I got  My SAG card  Hey let's go to Steve  Steve you got a question  For mankind  Mick Foley  Whatever he's calling  Himself today  Yeah hey what's up  Guys how you doing  How you doing  What's going on Mick 
[01:04:30]  I'm doing okay  Alright I heard  There was a story  About something called  The penis suplex  In your new book  Yeah listen  This is free radio  And that's a  $26 story  You want to hear  About the legend  Of the penis suplex  And how Bob Holley  Left Al Snow  Hanging in the breeze  For about 10 seconds  Upside down  In front of 18,000 people  In Montreal  Unfortunately for Al  For those of you  Who've worn a jock strap  And know what it does  To the male organ  There was really  Very little hanging  Going on 
[01:05:00]  Oh no  And it was one of those things  Where it should have been  Like the triumphant thing  I mean I talked Bob Holley  Into just really getting  My revenge for me  Humiliating Al  In front of 18,000 people  But it was like  Remember the episode  Of Seinfeld  Where Costanza got caught  Right after he'd been  In the cold pool  And that was  That was basically Al  And I was like  Oh I shouldn't have done that  And Al  To his credit  He got suplexed  And when he finally landed  Bob had him upside down  For about 10 seconds 
[01:05:30]  And Al was trying  To pull the damn thing over  But it just wasn't happening  And you know  It was  Al was not displayed  At his peak  And he hit the ground  And I was sure  He was going to be mad  I mean I sure  As I would have been mad  I was mad  When Austin threw me in  And exposed my love handles  You know on Monday night  I was like  Oh and then you can't  Reach down and pull him down  And then people are like  Oh I'll go  Look now he's  Trying to cover himself up  He's getting beaten up  He's more conservative  He's rolling a lot of fat  Around his waist showing  You do see that sometimes 
[01:06:00]  That's funny  I'm one of the worst people  You know  I think that's part of the reason  I started wearing the sweats  I mean I was a big puller-upper  You know  I mean I'd be busted wide open  Oh look at him  He's hurt  He's  He's down  He looks like he's out  Oh wait a minute  He's pulling up his pants  Al hit the canvas  And he had a big smile  And a laugh on his face  And I just said in the book  I said  I said he was laughing  But if he'd seen things  From my vantage point  I'm not sure he would have been  I mean it was  It was like  Oh it was ugly 
[01:06:30]  Maybe he's a grower  Not a shower  Oh yeah  Let's go to James  James what's going on  What's up ONA  Hey what's up  Mr. Mick Foley  How are you doing there  Not bad  And you  You coming to the big book signing tonight  Hell yeah  We wouldn't miss it  Yeah it's at WWF restaurant  He's going to leave in a few minutes  And start signing books at 5  Yeah  And like I said  If people show up at 5.36  It doesn't really matter  Because it is understood  That I will be there  Until the last person  Now if you show up at 9.30  Maybe not  But you know  I'm pretty much going to be signing  Until the last person's done  Cool 
[01:07:00]  Cool  You got a question James  Yeah man  Mick  I've been wondering this  Since it happened  What the hell was going through your mind  When you fell 16 feet off  Of that cell through a table  That was great  Let me see  It's like that Brian Riggin bit  I know what was in his mind  Yeah  You know honestly  You know  When I convinced Vince McMahon  You know  To Vince's credit  Vince is not a sadist  He doesn't ride the guys that hard  I was like  Yeah Vince  I'm going to come off the cage today  And he's like  No no  I was like  Look Vince 
[01:07:30]  You know I can drop elbows  From high places right  And he goes  Yeah  I said  If I'm going to drop an elbow off there  You'd probably let me right  He's like  Well I don't know  I was like  It's the same thing  And then you know  The guys are like  Well you've been up there right  You're comfortable  I was like  Yeah I've been up there  It's been a long time up there  I hadn't been up that high in my life  I got up on top of there  And I was like  Oh my god  You're going to be kidding me  I mean I looked down  And when Undertaker threw me  Honestly what I was thinking was  I'm really high up  And that table looks really small  But the truth is 
[01:08:00]  I mean at least I thought  The worst was over  Then you know  They took me away  In the stretcher  I made the triumphant return  Climbed back up the cage  And then when I got  Choke slammed through the cage  Which was not supposed to happen  That's actually when I got hurt the worst  Because there's a chair up there  On the cage  And it followed me down  By about a foot and a half  And I hit  And immediately went unconscious  So I was actually unconscious  When the chair hit me in the face  And you know  Put my tooth up my nose  And did all that bad stuff  It was sick  Yeah  That was a  Oh my god 
[01:08:30]  That was a rough night  You know  That was a  Yeah  Great footage though  Yeah  You know the nice thing about it  Is I did it once  And it got shown like  It got shown over and over  And over again  And you know  The sad thing is  There's kids out there  Trying to do the same stuff  And first off  They're not getting  Financially compensated  Second  They don't know  What the hell they're doing  And the third is  Nobody really cares  You know  At least in my case  It was like  A big deal was made out of it  And it lives on  And it was like  A great moment  In sports entertainment  But I  Please guys  You know 
[01:09:00]  Don't try to outdo it  Because if you do  No one's going to find out about it  And if your goal in life  Is to be on the best  Of backyard wrestling video  Then you've got  More serious problems  That I'm willing to take  Responsibility for  Nice  A little PSA  From Mick's book  Yeah  A little disclaimer  Tim what's going on  Hey guys  How you doing  Doing well  Yeah  In fact you just talked about  I wanted to comment  Opie how you made a  Comment about Mick's book  When he talked about football  And how  You know all of America  You know condones football  And people breaking legs 
[01:09:30]  And getting paralyzed  And then as soon as  Somebody wants to do  You know wrestling  Backyard or whatever  It's like oh my god  What's wrong with these kids  That's a parent  Okay go ahead  It's a good point  And you know one of the things  In this last chapter  And I advise people  If they like me  And want to keep their  Idea of me as a pretty good guy alive  Don't read the last chapter  Of the epilogue  Because I kind of take on  Wrestling's critics  And I mean I think  It's a really interesting chapter  To me that's the most important thing  Is try to like clear our name  Because I mean we have been  You know  We have been vilified  So badly by these people 
[01:10:00]  The thing is  Nobody in the mainstream media  Is willing to go out there  And say okay  So what is in this study  Like I found out  Indiana University study  Where they say  There's 128 instances  Of simulated sex  I mean I finally got  The professor on the phone  Because I kept calling  His office  Calling his office  Calling his office  And he was like  Well there was an instance  With sexual chocolate  And I was like  Yeah yeah  I know about that one  But what about  The other 127  And I said  I'll be honest with you  I did my own study  And he goes  Oh  And I said  Has anyone else done  Their own studies  He's like  I don't think so 
[01:10:30]  I'm like  So wait a second  Here's this thing  That's quoted  In 37 different newspapers  That I personally read  Not to mention  The news wires  And radio  I mean I don't know  How many times  It was probably  Repeated across the country  News magazines  I'm like  No one checked out  No one questioned it  I said  So what is  You know  Sex  Would that be like  Mae Young  Smoking a cigar in bed  And with the impression  Being that sex  Has just taken place  He's like  No  And I asked him  Like three other questions  He said  No no no  I said  Well what is it  He goes  Well there will be 
[01:11:00]  For example  A woman rubbing  A guy's arm  And I said  You know  Like don't you think  That's misleading  He goes  I don't think so  And I said  What about  The simulated drug use  42 instances  Of simulated drug use  And I said  You know  I thought  You know  X-Pac  Used to that thing  Where he says  You know  Your ass is grass  And I'm going to  Smoke it  I said  You know  If a guy  Puts his two fingers together  Does that constitute  Simulated drug use  He says  No  I said  What about  If one guy  Says you know  Roll a fatty  For this pimp daddy  Light that mother up  And say out loud  Pimp it ain't easy 
[01:11:30]  And I did the whole voice  For him too  On the phone  Pimp it ain't easy  We missed that  By the way  He said no  And I said  Well Jesus  I really don't  Remember any drug use  And he goes  That would be  Drinking beer  And at that point  You're like  You know  If the media  Is going to count  Beer drinking  As simulated drug use  That was why  I had to do  My top  Double secret study  On five episodes  Of Cheers  And find out  Their incidence  Of simulated drug use  Is actually  60 times higher  Than 60 times higher 
[01:12:00]  Than ours  When it comes to football  You know  I'm reading this guy  L. Brent Bozell  The Parents Television Council  He's got his report card  For all of the  For all of the  Different networks  And he's really  Blasting ABC  Saying that only  Sabrina the Teenage Witch  And the now cancelled  Boy Meets World  Which I happen to have been on  It's a good show  And he said  As far as scripted entertainment  And he goes  What else on the  On the Disney network  That isn't  Radioactive for children  And he mentions  Monday Night Football  And I thought  Wait a second 
[01:12:30]  I said  You're going to count  A cookie sheet to the head  As an act of violence  But these guys  Who freely admit  That football is a violent game  It's like  I mean  You want to  You want to play fair  Then there's six different  Violent acts  Taking place  On every game  And I don't think  I'm being unfair to football  These are the first people  Willing to tell you  Proudly that football  Is a violent game  Is the players  So I got a bunch of quotes  From autobiographies  Where I couldn't think  Of a non-violent way  To hit a guy  And another guy  Saying I like to think  My best hits border 
[01:13:00]  On felonious assault  And it's like  Well wait a second  This guy is judging shows  Based on whether  He likes them or not  And the thing is  The media doesn't  Question them  So I felt pretty strongly  About that  That last chapter  And not to mention  When a wrestler like me  Has got some broken bones  Some injuries  People are like  Oh how pathetic  But if you're a football player  It's cool  It's cool  It's like  Look how noble that is  He can barely walk  And I'm a better radio guest  I'll go on record  And say I'm a better radio guest 
[01:13:30]  Than Johnny Unitas ever was  Without a doubt  I know we've got to  Get you out of here  I just want to mention  A couple other things  In the new book  Foley is good  You made a reference  To George C. Scott  In hardcore  And Anthony and I  Are convinced  We're the only two  That have ever seen  That damn movie  We love it  Come on  I'm 35 now  I think I was 12 or 13  When we were trying  To get in the back door  At the old Port Jeff  77 cents  There you go  It went up like a penny  Every year  Like in 1978  It went up to 78 cents  And it was like  A parade of people  Trying to ask someone 
[01:14:00]  Who looked even remotely  Like an adult  Can you present  I'm your kid  You know  I mean the title alone  Hardcore  You wanted to get in  To see that movie  Oh it was big stuff  But yeah  But I can't  Like me remember  Why I used that  Hardcore reference  I think it was  When you were  I think it was  When I was talking  About Beyond the Mat  Right  A Miss Roberts  Interview  Oh yeah  Okay  Yeah exactly  For 2020  Where they  They  They  They raked me  Over the coals  What they did  Pretty much  For those guys  Who don't know  Is  They had me  Respond  As like  This inspiration 
[01:14:30]  For these  Backyard wrestlers  They had me  They wanted to get  My response  To video clips  Of kids  Doing backyard wrestling  And they show this stuff  And it's like  Kids jumping on each other  It's like the stuff  That I did  With the exception  Of the roof dive  If anyone else  Looks at my  Backyard wrestling  It was punches  That missed  By half a foot  You know  It was really  Weak looking  Leg drops  And elbow drops  Where nobody  Was going to get hurt  And so they  Basically showed me that  And I said  I said well  And I'm just a little surprised  Like I feel like  I've been around  Long enough to know  When there's a trap  Being set  And I said  You know 
[01:15:00]  I've seen a lot  Worse stuff than that  And I have a feeling  You're going to show me  Some worse stuff  Than that in a minute  And they all  Nodded their heads  And I said  But what I saw  It looked like  A bunch of kids  Having fun  So now they show me  The next thing  And it's the  Cheese  Is this fun  It's the barbed wire  It's all the wild stuff  That kids really  Shouldn't be doing  That I say  They shouldn't be doing  In my Ten Commandments  On Backyard Wrestling  But when the show airs  Two days later  They ask me the question  They show me  The violent footage  Oh boy  Say Mr. Foley  What do you think  And there I am going  Hey it looks like 
[01:15:30]  A bunch of kids  Having fun  Having fun  And I was like  You can't do that  You know  And that's when I realized  That basically  Respected news magazines  Like 2020  Are in a sense  Every sense  Faker than professional wrestling  Is that when  So you're watching  The clip  I'm watching the clip  Yeah  And I said  I felt like George C. Scott  Watching his daughter  Earn a buck  The hard way  In hardcore  And like you guys say  There we go  Turn it off  Yeah  Turn it off  That must have been  Horrible  Turn it off  Get a good one 
[01:16:00]  Turn it off  One more  One more  One more  Turn it off  Now the weeping one  Turn it off  You know what  It works so much better  With the film running  If it was a guy  Watching a video now  It wouldn't mean  They didn't have  Carry the weight  It's like  You know  We talk about that movie  All the time  When he was in  The seedy hotel  And all the porn people 
[01:16:30]  Were coming  And he had to act  Like a porn director  He was auditioning the guys  And they were unzipping their flies  And pulling their junk out  I'm Big Dick Black  Oh where is that one  We got all the clips  Put it back  It's now a comedy though  I saw it recently  Put it back  And here's one of the people  That we're auditioning  I'm Big Dick Black  Remember that  Big Dick Black came in  I'm Big Dick Black  Alright two  Really quick things 
[01:17:00]  And then we'll let you go  You want to nail Barbara Eden  Yeah that's a recurring thing  Well so do I though  You know  My top ten list  You know  Is actually a kind of fun thing  You know  It's a chapter  Entitled Super Dad  I should point out  It's really two books in one  It's a sweet  Sensitive story  About a father  Doing his best  To raise kids  While holding down  A kind of wild job  And it's a wrestling book  So for your audience  Skip the Super Dads  And the Boy Who Saved Christmas  And all those people  Unless you're secretly  A sensitive guy like myself 
[01:17:30]  But in this chapter  Super Dad  I list my top ten  Amusement parks  Top ten roller coasters  Top ten movies  TV shows  And Christmas songs  And I was going to include  A top ten list  Of people over 50  That I'd like to nail  And Barbara Eden  Would have been right  At the top of the list  Over 50  I wanted her growing up  I dream of Jeannie  I was convinced  That was a live show  I'd watch to see  If something was going  To slip out  Well don't you think  I mean  I'm you know  I'm a pretty  Pretty big star  Here I've written  A best seller 
[01:18:00]  I've been on TV  You've got a documentary  Where my kids are watching  Don't you think  I mean there's a chance  That Barbara Eden  Now in her mid 50s  Is watching that  Going  Oh  Which means  You might even  Have a shot  You never know  And I've got that  Understanding with my wife  That should the  Barbara Eden  Opportunity present itself  That all bets are off  I got that  With Drew Barrymore  My girlfriend  Everybody's got to have  At least one  And I've got like 17  You start getting into  70s porn star  Kay Parker 
[01:18:30]  Yeah but the image of it  The thought of it  Might be a little better  Than the reality  I doubt it  I doubt it  Really  I find older women  Very attractive  Really like even  Barbara Eden  Definitely  I think once you  Had Barbara Eden's  Clothes off  You might be a little  Disappointed  No  No  Because I'm one of those  Weirdos that  Sees the inner beauty  In people  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  That's what I say  To myself  When I look at myself  With harsh overhead  Lighting in a full length  Mirror  I'm just thinking  Barbara Eden's 
[01:19:00]  I'm a beautiful person  On the inside  Barbara Eden's  Inner beauty  Wouldn't be as tight  As other people's  Inner beauty  You know what I mean  Don't you talk about  Barbara that way  And finally  He loves Britney Spears  Too  Who doesn't  Yeah  Come on  Tells a good story  About Britney Spears  In the book  It's a good story  It's a nice  Sweet story  Oh she's doing it to me  And I had to actually  I get into this idea  That we met Britney  And you know 
[01:19:30]  Britney didn't know  Who we were  But that's not the story  We told  We got back to the  Dressing room  You know  And I had this little  Fictional relationship  With Britney going on  Blue Meanie was a big  Britney fan  I mean much bigger  I'll admit  I danced in the seat  Whenever  Hit me one more time  Came on  But I wasn't that  Big a fan  But the Meanie  Was like lovestruck  So I had Miss Kitty  Who was the cat  Who was fired  Yeah  Fired  She would leave  Messages on my cell phone  Saying she was Britney Spears  And just little things  Believable  Believability is the key  You can't say  Oh I wanted you so bad 
[01:20:00]  It would be more like  Hi this is Britney  I just want to say  I really like meeting you  And I want to see you  Hopefully you'll be on tour  When I am  So I give you a big hug  Stuff that sounds legit  You know  And it was all supposed  To start taking a seedier  You know  A seedier turn  And about that time  My daughter  Who was like five  At the time  Started really liking Britney  And there was that part of me  That said  I can't  Yeah you know  I can't have a seedier  Relationship with Britney Spears  Even if it isn't real  So  Your fatherly thing kicked out  I'd like to see if Britney  Likes it  Because it is a nice story 
[01:20:30]  And I regret saying  That up close  She looks suspiciously  Like any other 17 year old  But I mean  That's about the worst thing  I say about her  You know  I mean  I'd like to think  That she saw it  She'd probably be really  Offended by that  You know  Probably  Yeah  We've got to get you out of here  So you can go to the book signing  The book signing  Listen guys  If you're Long Island people  And you can't make it out tonight  Then we've got the one  At Long Island tomorrow  In Stony Brook  At Porter's  From 7 to 9  And then you guys say  You have quite a following  In Poughkeepsie  Without a doubt

[01:54:30]  With other humans  This is the girl talking  But with animals  There is no emotional attachment  That's true  Basically it's like  Enhanced  Pleasuring yourself  Because we're not allowed  To say the M word anymore  But my boyfriend  Doesn't feel the same way  He thinks it's cheating  Come on  I still think  It's not like being  Unfaithful with another human  What do you think  These  These  Calm down  You're going to take this  You bitch  And I mean bitch

[01:55:30]  It's weird that she stopped  After she met the guy  Who's also into bestiality  Why would she stop  Keep it going  Well they wanted  An exclusive commitment  To each other  Yeah  They just looked at each other  And she looked at him  And said  I hear you have genitals  You know you're right  I do  Would you like to see them  Well I've never seen you lick them  I like  I like my partner  To be able to lick his  It's the foreplay  Right  I'll just sit and watch  And how do you  You hook up 
[01:56:00]  And  And then finally discuss  That you liked it  Like who was the first one  To break that ice  Oh by the way  You ever look at a dog  And just see like  God damn  I've got to have some of that  No it's sort of like  So what do you like to do  In your spare time  Well I like to read  And  Nail dogs  And  I like to F chickens  It's fun  We saw that video  Oh the German chicken F-er  You know how I like my chicken  On my penis  We watched this video 
[01:56:30]  We watched the video  It was from Germany  Of course  And there's this big German guy  He's naked in a barn  He's got a chicken  In his  Both hands  And he's holding it down there  And you just hear the chicken going  It was so  Like dying  It was so disturbing  And he's like going  Yeah  Oh chicken  Yeah  Yeah  Chicken  Yeah  Yeah  I don't know what's German for chicken  But he was saying chicken  For you kids out there  He was wearing a condom  Yes which is very important 
[01:57:00]  When you're effing chickens  Okay  That's what we say  And don't be gross  Hogan  Get me a chicken  So let's go to Mike  Mike what's up  Hey what's up man  Hey  I work with this dude  That openly admits  To sleeping with donkeys  For like the last ten years  How do you sleep with a donkey  You don't sleep with a donkey  Ask them  Yeah  Yeah  Listen  Get it straight  Now what he does is  He's snuggling spoon  He's spoon with a donkey  No  What he told me was  I heard this almost fainted  He said he has to put a quarter 
[01:57:30]  In the donkey's ear  To like distract him  And then he takes the donkey's legs  And puts them in his  In a what?  In a what?  In his pocket  Like he takes the donkey's legs  And puts them in his front pants pocket  Wait wait  Donkeys are big  Horse like animals  I know they are  And everyone knows  You put the legs of the donkey  In the boots  And it's the sheep  That you do that to  Right  You take a sheep  You take them to the edge of a cliff  And then you push forward  And you put the real legs  Of the sheep  In your boots 
[01:58:00]  Then you go to town  And as you walk forward  And try to push the donkey  The sheep off the cliff  It'll back up real hard  And you know  It's all in your upcoming book  Yeah  Before you know it  You're effing a sheep  And it feels so good  Jerry  Grab a handful of wool  And go  You're you bitch  Make me a sweater  Is it Jerry or Jerry?  Jerry  All right  What's up?  I just want to know  If this bestiality chick  Ever gets crabs  Or maybe lobsters  Have crabs 
[01:58:30]  You can have crabs  And get crabs  But the sick boyfriend  Thinks it's cheating  He thinks it's cheating  If she goes back to the bestiality thing  So his answer  It's kind of long  But I'll just read a little bit of it  Well my first thought is  God I hope my mom isn't reading this  Yeah  There's a columnist  My second thought is  Perhaps it's time to find a new line of work  And my all important third thought is  Please in the name of Jane Goodall  Let this be a completely fabricated letter 
[01:59:00]  Ah  And then it just goes on  That cheating is like  When there's an emotional detachment  From your significant other  And that's what  But Jerry  Could you imagine them in a park  On a Saturday  With all  It's like going to a strip club  Going to a strip club  Yeah  Takes you to the ASPC  Yeah  Just take you to the shelter  He tells you you have to break in  With dollar bills  They're in cages  Come on you little  Cocker spaniel  Come here  Oh  Don't toy with me  Don't toy with me 
[01:59:30]  I'm going to the park  The guy who runs the cattle  Comes in and he sees  Like this Cocker spaniel  With a collar  It's got like  Four hundred dollar  Bill's tit  Sticky stuff  In his collar  You're hot  Why is this animal sticky?  Hello?  What's the preferred animal  Of a beastial  Someone into bestiality?  Like what  What would it be like  A dream animal?  It's got to be  I don't know  It's got to be dogs  You think a dog?  We've seen the  We've seen the dog videos  On the internet  They say if you put  The peanut butter down there 
[02:00:00]  The dog  Ah the dog  Yes that old urban legend  Of a girl that came in  And the surprise party happened  And she had the peanut butter  What?  That happened to a friend of mine  It was a friend of yours?  A friend of mine's cousin  I thought it was an urban legend  Because I heard it from a guy  Who said it was from  His cousin's uncle  Or something like that  No I know one of the guys  That surprised her  Oh  It was like a surprise for her  Yeah  She was naked  And the dog was doing the thing  Interesting  Yeah  I didn't know that was  Because I was at the wedding  Where the groom told everyone 
[02:00:30]  To turn the plates over  At the reception  And it was the bride  With the best man  A picture of it  On the bottom of every plate  I was at that wedding  Myself  Well the best man  Was effing the  Effing the bride  The bride  Yeah  Yeah  I was at that wedding  So that's not an urban legend either  Just like the peanut butter one  Who believes that crap?  She found a dog  Swimming in the oceans  Off of Mexico  Wondering how the dog  Got 20 miles out to sea  She nursed it back to health 
[02:01:00]  And brought it back  To her home in Iowa  When the dog  Attacked her cat  And ate it  She took it to the vet  Thinking it had rabies  The vet said  Oh my god  Do you know what you have here?  She said  A dog from Mexico  No  It's a giant water rat  Little Mikey ate Pop Rocks  And drank coke  And exploded  That lady lived in Belmore  Was it Belmore?  I thought it was Iowa  No I made Newsday 
[02:01:30]  Damn I missed that one too  That's a real story too  What a crap  I love when people  Try to tell you these  Like they're real  My favorite though  Did I interrupt you?  I think I did  Go ahead Paul  No that's all  No no no  We're off on another tangent  See what happens?  Go go go  It's like Mr. Toad's  Wild ride of conversation  Hey a train's coming toward me  My favorite urban legend story  Is the forest fire one  Yeah  Where there's a forest fire  And so they get the planes  That scoop down and get the water  To put out the fire  Right  So they put out the fire that way 
[02:02:00]  With scooping the water  From whatever the lake  Or the ocean  Or whatever is nearby  And they put out the fire  And then they go in  So they put out the fire?  Yeah  Alright sorry Paul  So then they go in the woods  To kind of you know  See what the fire was all about  And there's a scuba diver  Yeah  Found dead  Not burnt  Or anything  Still in his wetsuit  That doesn't happen  And he was dead in the forest  And they  It's reported  It's reported  It's reported as a true story  They determined that the plane came down  Picked up some water  Scooped him right up  Dropped him on the fire 
[02:02:30]  And you know  He just fell  When he's in the plane on the way up  He's got to be saying to himself  Oh this is just great  What is this?  Eight million dives in the water  This jerk's got to get me  And I was afraid of sharks  I had to listen to my wife  Go near the surface  If things are cooler up there  Well I'm above the surface  Are you happy now?  That's great  I mean that is such a fabricated story  But think of the poor guy 
[02:03:00]  Thinking  I would think  The first thing that would hit my head is  UFOs are real  They scoop  Because you're now in the water  Floating around  Looking around  There's just metal around you  As I'm falling  I'm thinking  Now what did the guy at the store say  About this wetsuit?  Can I keep you being stabbed  By a giant pine tree?  You know  I never learned this  In scuba class  What do you do  When you're plummeting  From a few thousand feet?  Eight quick breaths  And then hold  Or is it just 
[02:03:30]  Mommy!  Look  My depth gauge works  As an altimeter  It's in the negative territory  Hey I can see my house  From up here  And it's burning  And I'm so effing dead  Judge  Maybe if I flip  With my flippers  Real fast down  No this is not working  I'm definitely keeping  My mask on  Because I want  I want shards of glass  To go into my eye  At least I won't drown  I've got plenty of air 
[02:04:00]  Maybe he took his weight belt off  Thinking  That would  That would save him  Let me get a belt off  Oh there I'm fine now  I'm falling so much slower  Right now  But look at that weight belt go  Hello  That weight belt is screwed  Billy  Newton  What's up  Jackass  Jackass  What's up Billy  What's going on  I got a funny story for you  Yeah  Mag's girlfriend  Alright  Tells me how when she was younger 
[02:04:30]  Her and her friend  Was laying in the bed  And they'd have the neighbor  The neighbor's Doberman  Come over and give  Fellatio to both of them  Nice  And she said it was the best thing  She's ever felt  She likes the German  She likes the German shepherd  Ah  Yeah  Good  Good  Alright Billy  Thank you  I don't know  Hey it was bad  I'm not into the bestiality  No no  Call me weird  It's that whole thing  Like excrement on the body  Like that whole  Yeah  It's like sort of 
[02:05:00]  At one point  You know it's like  Seeing the videos  On the internet  What  What  What  We saw one with a  A bestiality one  Yeah  Dalmatian or something  I know there's one out there  It's a favorite  It's an oldie but goodie  It's called horse gag  Ah  And all you could say  Is the girl at one point  Sounds just like this  Yeah  Yeah  That's all I can do  To describe it  You fill in the blanks  But who would want to go  Near the back end  Of a donkey or a horse 
[02:05:30]  Mmhmm  Mmhmm  Um  I don't know  It was called being  Stump broke  If a horse is  Stump broke  Because it could  Just stay right near  The tree stump  That the guy's got to  Get on  To  Do the horse  This guy's got to be  Thinking I should  Get a saddle  How do you get  Behind a horse  You approach  From the side  And just  Work your way around  You go with flowers  Yeah  There you go  Oh no  He's trying to have  Sex with me again  Jared  That's all you needed 
[02:06:00]  Wilbur  Oh no  Wilbur  You know  Wilbur  Mr. Ed  Was going  He doesn't even  Bring me sugar cubes  Anymore  Did you  What  You think  It was a coincidence  That that  Cardigan was like  A waist size  Didn't go over  His crotch  He had ready  Access to the  Equipment  You know  What I'm saying  He could pull  The junk out  At any moment  Not only that  Now that you  Mention it  How about  Mr. Ed's stall  With the double doors  Exactly  He could shut  The top one  Just open up  The bottom one  Because that's  All he really  Needs for access 
[02:06:30]  And how do you  Think  That's how you  Get a tall horse  To talk  Ouch  How do you  Think no donkeys  Talk  Oh well  It was one donkey  What was the donkey  That talked  No they don't  Talk either  Because you can't  Get behind them  Because they kick  They kick you  That's going to  Be my quest  God  How do you  Feel though  How do you  Feel  You know  Sometimes  I think you  Feel used  You know  Sometimes after  After you  Especially when  You first started  You're  Taking care of 
[02:07:00]  Yourself  When you're  Younger  You kind of  Felt a little  Weird  Creepy  And dirty  When you were  Done  Did you really  Yeah  Because I'm  Talking right  When you start  The habit  And I do  Call it a habit  Of cranking it  I did  Because my  Father would  Join me  And I was  The opposite  I was like  This is cool  I  Yeah  No it was  Great  But you  I had  Superpowers  When you got  Done  You felt  A little  Dirty  Put it  This way  You felt  Weird about  Clean up

[02:08:00]  What have I  Become  Yeah right  What have I  Become  And if you're  Doing it  Three four times  A day  You really start  Assessing  What have you  Become  And I'm just  Saying  Could you  Imagine  After you're  Finished with  Your dog  No I think  You build to  That  I think what  Happens is  You're like  Okay what have  I become  You do it  And you just  Become accustomed  It's not a big  Deal  I'm just  You know  Whatever  And then  It's like  You know  Women  Okay but  Then okay  And then  You're bored  With women  And you try  It in different  Holes  It's no serious  It's like  You get bored  And we get bored 
[02:08:30]  As a society  And then your dog  Yeah and then your dog  And you're like  You're petting the dog  And you kiss the dog  Right maybe you  French kiss the dog  And you're like  That wasn't so bad  I French kissed the dog  And then like  The dog has a tick  And the tick is like  Right near his anus  Yeah  You just burn the tick off  And you look at it  And you know  It's a pretty anus  It's getting too descriptive  Which I think you've already  Before you know  You're into the BCL  Yeah  And then it starts  But you feel bad afterwards  Especially if you see  Your poor dog  Doing that walk  Across the carpet 
[02:09:00]  With his back legs up  Dragging  And you're walking  On the front  Paws  You're like  I did that  He wanted it  I did that to him  You know  He was teasing me  He was teasing me  He was breathing  He was asking for it  He was breathing  Jesus  His tongue is out  And you're panting  You wanted it  That long red tongue  What's that trying to say to me  But Anthony  Clean up time is awkward  No matter what  Even like today  You know  When you're  Today  What happened today  Not today  But I mean today  You know 
[02:09:30]  You're saying going back  When you first discovered  You could do this to yourself  But I mean  In your regular sex life  You get into situations  Where at the time  You're like  Hey this is  This is pretty wild  This is pretty cool  But then when the act is over  And you have to do  Clean up time  Like oh my god  Look at all the utensils  We used  And all the  Right  Yeah  Clean up  Right  It's always a little weird  Is what I'm saying  Clean up time  When you  You know  Take care of yourself  When you take care of yourself  Like you've got  Like a  Like you've got  Manpower cleaners  Coming in  Four guys  Shot back

[02:14:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show  Afternoon Radio  This is it  You can't go anywhere else  Nowhere to go  That's like saying you don't like Earth  You're leaving  Where are you going  Opie and Anthony  And we finally have control  Yes  1-0-2-7  W-N-W-N-W  We got Emily an ER nurse  Hi guys  How can you do it?  We'll see if this is a real story or not  She's going to have a great story  Emily?  Hi  Hi  Oh  Yeah  It was  The husband was kind of like propping up the dog behind him 
[02:14:30]  Now we're having fun  A jacket over him  Yeah  Oh jeez  I don't know how far that got  Yeah hold on  Hold on  Hold on  They're going to jump out of that  It's okay  Okay  It's all in the context  Emily  Yeah the story with dogs is that after they release  So bummed  I guess they get extremely engorged  It's just I don't know what the broadcast parameters are for bestiality 
[02:15:00]  If it's just you just want to keep it from being too descriptive  That's why I'm trying to be careful  Yeah  I'm sorry  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  So I don't know if you guys got the point at this point  The dog was attached to the wife  What kind of dog?  It was a mutt  But you know I wasn't looking  Common street whore  So basically you know both had to be put on a stretcher  Probably living in a dog house  I mean at that point it really just takes time 
[02:15:30]  For everything to kind of calm down  But  What?  So what you guys just waited for the dog to calm down?  Yeah we sedated the dog  Yeah  To the point where the dog was relaxed enough that we could  Roofies?  Remove  That's what you gave it  Some roofies  No  Oh bad  I'm probably  I mean there's a lot of sick stuff that goes on that you know  Us in the emergency room we get to see  Did you ever get the story you know 
[02:16:00]  On what was going on?  I mean  No  We know what was going on but  Where did it go?  What was going on?  What do you mean what was going on?  The dog lost his keys in her  What do you think was going on?  Have you seen one?  I wasn't  I mean they were completely mortified  I would guess  Obviously  That's probably the most embarrassing situation you could be in  I wonder what the series of emotions are  When you realize you can't  What kicks in  When do you finally decide to go to the emergency room?  You know what?  You have to sacrifice the dog  You can't leave the house in that state  Yeah exactly 
[02:16:30]  You cannot  Wow  Fluffy has to go  Yeah  Gotta die  Get the hedge clippers out  And  One bullet  Right  Yeah  And the dog is extremely agitated at that point too  And the woman is  I'm sorry  Because the dog doesn't have blue cross brew shield  Yeah  I'm paying for this  Sorry Fluffy  Yeah we had to give her stitches on her shoulders and stuff  It was  Stitches from what?  The claws?  Mmhmm  Yeah  Oh my god  You like it bitch  Don't you?  It was  It was 
[02:17:00]  Totally the most bizarre thing I've come across  How would you wrap the claws?  You would want to wrap the  At least  Yeah  Yeah good  Very very good  Well  Wrap the claws  Seems like Paul's a  You don't get hurt  It's like feeling the nails on her back  I don't know  All right Emily  Very good  Thank you  All right  Bye bye  We have my wife macromade some paw covers for the dog  That's all I'm saying  Macromade  There it is  Here's someone that's in a little bit of trouble 
[02:17:30]  Poor bastard  Don't go to bed  Get no price on your head  No no  Don't do it  Don't do it  Don't do the crime  If you can't do the time  Oh yeah  Don't do it  And keep your eye  On the sparrow  You're a filthy whore 
[02:18:00]  Don't do it  Don't do it  Where can I go  Where the cold winds don't blow  Now  Well well well well well  Yeah  That's funny 
[02:18:30]  Look at that  Well Opie  On the Robert Blake front  It seems at a Los Angeles TV station  Reporting Robert Blake  Is the main focus  Of the police investigation  We said that as soon as the story broke  It was obvious  He's got an OJ thing going here  Yeah  But see  Blake was a little smarter  He hired someone  Someone else  To do the dirty work  Right  OJ as we all know  Did it himself 
[02:19:00]  And somehow  Got away with it  We all are still to this day  Amazed at the cunning of OJ  He has a videotape of it  He had a friend come  He had a videographer come  In the bushes  And tape the whole thing  Not admissible  But you look at the OJ thing  And how sloppy  And shoddy  This murder was  That Marsha Clark  And this guy Darden  Are around  And making money  And TV  Or whatever  It's just like  They should be shipped  Out of the country  They should be sterilized  Losing that case 
[02:19:30]  How do you lose that case  It was the most  It's not like  He planned anything out  I mean  He was pissed off  He got himself  A sweatsuit  And that hood thing  A knife  And hacked two people up  And left more DNA  Interspersed  Where there's no possible way  Anyone else could have done it  And I'm home free  Bruno Mali  I only owned that pair  For a year or two  He left OJ cufflinks  His social security card  Everything  I don't know 
[02:20:00]  We can't nail this guy  I wrote in blood  OJ was here  We need Beretta for this  Or at least a parrot  She was bludgeoned  Over the head  With a Heisman trophy  Is that  I don't know where  You got it  The real killer  So what's  Any more details  On Blake  What do we got today  Anything  Well  She's in the car  He's in the car  Honey  I gotta go in  I left my  He left his gun  He left his gun  In the  Left my gun  I just picture him  Bumbling  Like flipping the gun  In the air  And going  Oops 
[02:20:30]  You know  And dropping it  Under the table  Oops  And then  And then just  Eating the spaghetti  And leaving it  I forgot my 44  Under the table  He had a 44  Which is a large weapon  I think when he gave him  His salad plate  He actually gave him  His 44 at the same time  The waiter  Maybe that was it  Maybe that was it  They thought it was  A utensil  Or something  44 is a pretty big weapon  It's not like  A little throw down  That you might have  Or something  That you might  Lose under the table  It's not something  That Jim West  Keeps in his boot 
[02:21:00]  Right  A little Derringer  Or something  No it's a big gun  That would probably  Go clunk  When it hit the ground  You can't miss it  You probably need  To move  The salt and pepper shaker  Off the table  To make room for the gun  Just to make room  For the gun  The hand cannon  That dirty Harry used  A 44  She's sitting  Okay you go get the gun  I'll stay in the car  With the leftover  Chicken cacciatore  Right  Did you see the sign  Of the place there  And it was like  It looked like  The Tellas 
[02:21:30]  Yeah  The lowest end restaurant  Some dive  Some dive restaurant  That he's been going to  From what I hear  For about 20 years  Like you know  The amount of cooking  Involved is opening up  A can of Chef Boyardee  In the back  Okay  Ding ding  Number seven  Any food that comes out  In the shape of the can  It was in  Great food  The Tellos  I think it was  Great food  The cranberry sauce  He's not taking  The lie detector test  Yeah he's not taking that  And his lawyer  Has gone into this 
[02:22:00]  Attack mode  On the girl  On the dead girl  He's now saying  That she was  A despicable woman  Which she was  If the facts are true  She built a lot of these  Old guys  Out of their money  And she was  Obsessed with fame  And famous people  She continued her business  After she married him  By still sending out  Naked pictures of herself  To lonely men  To lonely men  But like they were  Old pictures  So she looked hot  She was a real pig  No they weren't even  Pictures of her  She was sending out 
[02:22:30]  Pictures of other women  Saying it's her  There you go  That probably never happened  She was not  She was not  Just like internet pictures  Of hey this is me  Yeah sure it is  Let me put it this way  She makes Shantae Kimes look hot  A Shantae Kimes joke  Holy Jesus  Palomino  Bravo  Yeah but it's looking  Real bad  Because like I said  His lawyer went into  This mode  Where he's attacking  The girl  He's not taking  The lie detector  And his stories  Are a little shaky 
[02:23:00]  About going in  And getting the gun  And then the owner  One of the owners  Of the restaurant  Says he came in  All nervous  Nervous  Took down two glasses  Of water  As he was sweating  And didn't recover  A missing weapon  And then went outside  Saw that his wife  Was shot in the head  And then freaked out  Ran across the street  But things just  Don't quite add up  So there's police  At his house  Taking stuff out  Of the house  And they've impounded  The vehicles  From the house  And the vehicles  Always an important part 
[02:23:30]  In celebrity murders  Who could forget  The Bronco  By the way  That had everyone's  Blood on it  Involved in the murder  Was parked in front  Of O.J.'s house  With O.J.'s blood  Like everyone  That's ever been  Involved in murder  No, no  There's an  Eight billion  To one shot  It ain't me  Sacco and Vanzetti's  Blood were on it  Wow  Just a reference man  Today  Listen, why is  Let's step back  A minute  Robert Blake  Has not been on the air  In what  25 years  Yeah  You know 
[02:24:00]  I don't even think  They had residuals  Back then  Wow  Why is he packing  Such a big piece  Who's coming after him  What does he have  Of any value  He's saying  That he got the weapon  Because his wife  Was getting  Death threats  From her shady past  But now  People are also saying  That there weren't  Any death threats  Or  I got the gun  Because of my wife's  Death threats  And because I was  Going to kill her  That  Oh yeah  There was two  Killer  I'm thinking  He was supposed to  Go into the restaurant  Say he forgot his gun 
[02:24:30]  If he did pick up his gun  He left it there on purpose  Right  He goes  Oh, I forgot my gun  Let me go inside  It's perfect now  For her to get shot  Because he doesn't have  His gun with him  Right  He's supposed to go in  Get his gun  That's where he drinks  His water and stuff  Come out  After she's shot  And then as the  Guy that killed her  Is getting away  He fires a few in the air  Looking like  Hey, I'm trying to save her  He fired some in the air  No  He didn't go out  He pussyed out  Beretta pussyed out  He stayed in the  Supposed to make it look good  Like I'm going to come out 
[02:25:00]  Start shooting at you  But I'm going to miss you  Wouldn't that be perfect  Then you go off  It makes perfect sense  Now, yeah  I got powder burns  On my hand  But I was shooting  At the bad guy  I'm shooting  And it covers him  Totally  So he goes in  Two glasses of water  He forgets to come out  He forgets to come out  Or he's too scared  To come out  Because there's a guy  That killed his wife  Out there  And he knows it  Just don't shoot  Over my head  Okay  We'll both get through this  And then we'll  If that don't work  We'll take her to  Bill Shat in the swimming pool  Because that's another 
[02:25:30]  Great place  To kill your wife  Yes, it's perfect  What a great crime this is  And I got off  Scott Freak  No one even suspected  Captain Kirk would kill his wife  Listen, you need Columbo on this  Yeah, oh, we already went through that  And there's that  You watch Columbo  And you see  Like crimes being solved  Where the celebrity criminal  Just planned this murder out  Meticulously  And he gets caught  Because Columbo  Yeah, pardon me  One more thing 
[02:26:00]  The window  Why were there footprints  Beneath the window  If no one came out the window  And then  The guy's always got to be as smart  As he's  He just goes  Hey, lieutenant  I don't know  Figure it out  He goes  Ha, ha  Elementary  Lieutenant Columbo  Of Paul St. Gardner  Was out there  Out of garden  I should have thought of that  And before you know it  The guy just effed himself  By talking  By the way, Columbo  Had sex with his dog  Did he?  Bestiality  Bestiality  I would just pop my eye out  What I used to do  As far as bestiality's concerned 
[02:26:30]  Remember I had that bloodhound  In my old car  I think her name  What was her name?  Her name was Jody  The  Whoah  Jehoah  It was a whoah  I think she was  Were you with someone last night?  So I would go  With my bloodhound  And what I would do is  I'd put a little  Alpo  In my eye socket  And before you know it  My bloodhound  Is pounded on it  Like it's a pretty  Peppy to poodle  Cause I love  Getting skull effed  By my bloodhound  He's doing it so hard  I can see spots  Out of my eye 
[02:27:00]  It's wonderful  It's a slight pain  But it's a good hurt  It's a good hurt  You gotta work for it  It clears out the sinuses  Actually  I put snausages  And bacon strips  And he goes  I can't believe  It's not bacon  Cause it's bacon  Later in life  You had to put cycle four  Cause the dog got older  Yes  And I also like  Putting a milk bone  In my A  By A I'm saying  Because I'm on the radio 
[02:27:30]  Hey Vinny  What are you doing guys?  What's up Vinny?  Hey  Did you guys see  In the New York Post  The page  Six cartoon this morning?  Oh yeah  It's great  It's got a picture  Robert Blake  With his arm around OJ  And the lawyer's saying  We got an airtight alibi  And they got OJ  I was with  I was with Robert Blake that night  No but was he with J  Or was he with O?  Yeah  Cause OJ said  There were two killers  So he'd say  It was O and J  Now O 
[02:28:00]  Didn't want to do it  But J is very angry  I think the two of them  Are going to go out  And start looking for the killers  Of each of their wives  Right  That's what I thought  When Robert Blake hired  A private investigator  To look for the real killers  At least with OJ  You know  You get great shots of her wife  Like at that football game  With the thing  But this one  This one's just a slob  Oh it's like looking at my mother  In a house dress  And she just  You know what I mean  It's not as tragic  When they're not attracted  No exactly  We're a horrible society  Aren't we?  You have no value as a woman  If you're not attractive  Yeah  Do you think 
[02:28:30]  Just think about it  As far as any murders go  Or anything  Kids are being killed  All the time  Why was the JonBenet thing  So tragic?  She was a hot little bitch  That's why  And she wanted it  Oh that's awful  It's not a little  Prancing around  It's called dark humor  The thing and the tat  And the thing  And the peels  And I'm a little  Peepot teepot  Yeah get in here  And talk to the dog  Don't start with me  On that  The little cowboy outfit  She wanted  That's out of the 
[02:29:00]  Victoria's Secret  Stripper catalog  But you know something  But I'm just  What I'm trying to point out here  Is how we are as a society  It's  We don't really  Care  If there's ugly  Innocent children  Being killed  It's the cute one  Look the JonBenet thing  Was huge  What are you  Charlie Rose?

[02:47:00]  way because i don't want anybody knowing about my past if i don't want them to know  right like you know because people that recognize me are going to be like wow that's the girl and  it happened to me five six times already uh wait wait now people come up to you on the street  people have come up to me um i go sing karaoke like twice a week at a bar with my friend he's a dj  and um don't tell us exactly where but like what town i'm not uh in brooklyn in bayridge  so the thing is wait a minute hold on hold on hold on are you like from the bay ridge area 
[02:47:30]  i'm from the bay ridge um sunset park uh i think we're neighbors oh really and i i think i know  exactly where uh you're talking about because there's a sign outside that says karaoke yeah  yeah i just asked it the other day i gotta get in there and see you sing  you have a good voice i live right in bay ridge wow i see around uh that would have freaked me out

[02:48:30]  would know you he's stuck in his own world right now in my book good thing yeah he's uh he's the  owner of a couple of stores so he's very busy if he starts catching on just give him some of that  lithium and the stuff you were on in bellevue because he doesn't remember oh my god you could  hear the way you talk now and the way you were talking in in the special you hear my words  look slow yeah you're like yeah you were all like they had me on lithium actually lithium 
[02:49:00]  lithium which i'm allergic to that runs the enterprise oh wait that's silent um angela  this next clip is going to be pretty intense you really don't remember dancing around with a picture  of your daddy not at all on the hbo special and it was to the song daddy's home to stay  oh great and you're dancing and you're spinning that's me too you're spinning around and you got your  you occasionally reach up to the sky and look up and start like really crying and then you put your  arms around yourself and start like dancing around in a circle wow i'm gonna see the tape later though 
[02:49:30]  are you oh i'll be uh very interested to hear this yeah you want to hear this really yeah if you don't  i i will just forget about it it's intense all right here we go anyway just play it if she doesn't  my hair to pull the phone away from your ear okay okay first time she's hearing this  i love you  dad 
[02:50:00]  oh  All right, ma'am. 
[02:50:30]  All right, well, I hope you do karaoke better than you sang Daddy's Home.  Or maybe it was the lithium.  I usually sing karaoke while I'm crying.  Yeah, really.  That would be like a huge hit if you sang Daddy's Home at karaoke.  If you're in medicine, it magnifies everything. 
[02:51:00]  Plus, that song my father needs to sing to me.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Why was it on?  Did you pick it?  Well, you obviously don't know now.  I have no idea.  Oh, man.  I don't even know.  I just can't wait to see the tape later after work.  I'm dying to see the tape.  That was an intense moment on the show.  Yeah.  On the HBO show.  It's kind of hard to hear, but you were really losing it.  See, but if people will look at it and realize, I'm not crazy.  Say you're home, right?  And you hear a song that reminds you of somebody that you missed or died or a loved one or whatever. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  You're going to get emotional.  If you're by yourself, you might cry.  If you're a faggy.  I'm kidding.  But, you know, he's in me.  Yeah.  My brother just called me.  He was like, was that you on the radio?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that was me.  Oh, God.  Yeah, but like we were saying before, if you're in a Bellevue special.  Yeah.  And then you walk down the street, you're going to think you're a kook.  I know.  You know, it's a good thing, I guess, to come on. 
[02:52:00]  It's what happens, but I went there because they would give me better help.  I heard about the hospitals really good.  Yeah.  But now that they did this to me, I mean, it's unbelievable.  A lot of people calling in saying she's full of it.  She has to remember doing all this stuff.  I honestly don't.  Did you see the special?  She was, like, totally drugged up.  That's what I'm saying.  You're not in your way frame of mind.  Plus, when you're totally depressed, you're not in your way frame of mind.  So, that's a double whammy.  Yeah.  All right, Angela.  All right.  We have you penciled in to come in, right? 
[02:52:30]  Excuse me?  We have you set up to come in live?  Yes, on Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Good.  Nice.  We'll get your thoughts on the tape because you're going to watch it tonight, huh?  Yes.  All right.  All righty.  All right, Angela.  Well, thanks a lot.  I'll see you Tuesday.  Okay.  I'll see you Saturday for karaoke.  Oh, okay.  Take it easy.  Okay.  There she goes, Angela.  All right, bye-bye.  Those clips are tough to hear.  That's hysterical.  She's my neighbor.  I was just, I swear, I was just passing by that bar the other day and I saw a sign that 
[02:53:00]  said karaoke this Saturday.  It's outside.  I'm like, oh.  Okay.  You should go and bring a video, can you?  Right?  Yeah.  Put on daddy's phone.  Oh, that's terrible.  Come on.  Right in the jukebox.  All right.  Well, what a day, huh?  Yes.  We got a banner show.  We could do a little bit of what did we learn today.  I want to thank Mick Foley, Mankind, Cactus Jack, Dude Love, whatever you call him. 
[02:53:30]  The place was crowded with all those guys in it.  Yes, yes, yes.  He's a great guy and it was a lot of fun having him on the show today.  Also, Paul Mercurio from The Daily Show.  Very, very good.  A couple things really fast.  Keep voting for your favorite in the whipped cream bikini contest.  By showtime tomorrow, we'll be down to four girls and we'll announce the winner on Monday.  So, you've got to keep voting every day.  Yeah.  Up till Monday, okay?  Can we get a karaoke machine for Tuesday? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Kooky-okey.  No, I'm kidding.  Come on.  It sounds like she's got a sense of humor.  Right?  You just need the karaoke.  Yeah, just the music.  Yeah, the music.  You can just get the music.  Put the headphones on and she'll do her thing.  Sing a little karaoke.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Why not?  I like that.  We're not going to announce the winner of the whipped cream bikini contest tomorrow because  we will be on the road doing this road trip, this WOW road trip thing.  A new idea that we came up with.  We'll see how it goes.  If it goes well, we'll be doing this from time to time. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  There's a lot of people bitching that we're not going to make it up to Connecticut or Rockland  County or further west in Jersey or Suffolk County on Long Island.  You know, we had to kind of keep it close to Manhattan for the first time because we're  going to try to get to about 10 different locations in seven hours tomorrow.  Yeah, we're covering them.  And just having a lot of fun.  We're covering a lot of ground.  It's going to be hit and run, hit and run, hit and run.  We got the route on WNAW.com.  So if one of these locations is near you, we'd love to see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  We're going to start doing updates and things like that on the Ronda Fez show tomorrow 
[02:55:00]  at noon.  Because we're leaving at noon tomorrow.  Yeah, it's an all day affair.  And we'll be doing the show live from the bus.  It's going to be a mess.  We know it.  But it's going to be a lot of fun as well.  Yeah.  And that's why we won't announce the Winter Whipped Cream Bikini Contest until Monday.  Because there'll be too much going on tomorrow.  Okay?  Yeah.  Woo!  All right, let's go to the phones and play What Did We Learn on the ONA Show today?  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.

Andrew from Jersey, I learned if you don't clean up, you'll wake up covered in crumpled  Lorna Dunes.  Yeah, that was a great line today.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that it's customary to play the Shaft team in Bellevue over and over and over  and over again.  That's good.  All right.  Stinky rules, guys.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:56:30]  Stinky rules.  He does.  Adam, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned all the hotties are hanging out at Bellevue.  Mm-hmm.  And that the technique I've been using on my farm animals is all wrong.  Thanks for the help.  You're welcome.  You guys suck.  All right.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Today's What Did I Learn comes from the Daily Dump Sheet on FoundryMusic.com.  Okay.  And that is that George doesn't get credit for his own dumps.  Yeah.  Otto gets credit for him.  Otto didn't say any of those things. 
[02:57:00]  George did.  Yeah.  All right.  Good job.  Kind of wacky.  Very good.  All right, boys.  Bye.  Jason from Bloomfield.  I learned Bellevue Hospital is great for picking up drugged up girls with nice cans.  What did I learn on the show today?  I learned some pro wrestlers shop for dildos.  That's Tony from Babylon.  Yes, we did learn that.  Special K from New Jersey.  Today, I learned that while the listeners are listening to commercials, there's an uncomfortable  silence in the studio with Opie and Anthony and their guests. 
[02:57:30]  Not with us.  Not with us.  Even Mankind or Mick Foley admitted that it was cool when the commercials were playing.  Carolyn, what's up?  Hey, I learned what happened to Opie's French scuba diving friend.  Yeah.  Hey, that's good.  Opie was flying the plane.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  I learned that Anthony knows all too well how to screw a sheep.  Yeah, huh?  That's very disturbing.  Isn't that?  How many times have you tried to do that over there in Brooklyn? 
[02:58:00]  Well, let me think.  There's no real cliffs to back them up to.  Is that what you and Joe were really doing in the woods?  Is that what they caught the fires?  Is that why the fire started?  You dropped your ladder as it was giving it to you good?  That is disturbing that I knew that and knew about putting the child in the shopping bag in the bathroom stall.  So, like, I told those, while you're fascinated at the story itself, you're frightened that I even know about it.  Exactly.  Yeah, same with me.  All right, Dad.  Thank you.  See you, Davey.  All right.  Bye.  Today I learned that Paul Mercurio has two dads. 
[02:58:30]  Today I learned that I learned a new sound, horse gag.  Today I learned and suffers from peg.  Peg?  Post guilt.  No, only when I'm pleasuring.  Or back when I was just starting.  Today I learned, now I don't care where it goes.  I don't care where the web.  I don't care where it's up.  Fly that web.  Today I learned to wrap the claws.  Today I learned, forget the Third Reich. 
[02:59:00]  Watch out for the ticks.  Today I learned Angela is more normal than 90% of the women who call the show.  Yeah.  Hello!  That woman should be in Bellevue.  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Dave?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  What did you learn?  I learned today that Mr. Red sounds remarkably like Don Imus.  Yeah, that was...  Really?  A little bit.  Hey, Wilbur.  That was a little bit in there.  Stop trying to hump me.  And Don Imus is a...  No, it doesn't.  Shut up!  Jack, F, douche, C. 
[02:59:30]  Wow.  Dan from Hoboken, I learned you don't canoodle.  What does that mean?  I learned you don't canoodle a donkey.  You F it.  I love when the canoodle word makes our radio show.  Casino from Hell, I learned Louis Black is a happy Jew.  Mm-hmm.  Dan from Hoboken, I learned only Japanese guys and crazy chicks do karaoke.  Ricky.  That would be terrible. 
[03:00:00]  I like Dan's other one.  Which one?  I like Dan's other one about this.  Which...  Oh, I think I threw that one down.  No, there it is.  Dan from Hoboken, I learned I now have to decide which of three stations to instant feedback in the morning.  I learned because it was taped two and a half years ago.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medication doesn't work.  I've been here for nine and a half years.  You think he's still at it? 
[03:00:30]  Probably.  Oh, my God.  Could you...  All right.  Ben's telling us to get the hell out of here.  Well, first thing we got to do now is say goodbye.  To the lovely and talented Kelly.  Kelly.  She broke our heart today.  She comes in and goes, by the way, guys, today...  I'm leaving you.  ...at my last day.  I was like, she's breaking up with us?  Like, no.  Her internship's ending.  Like, damn.  Ant and I had no idea.  No one said anything.  We're just trying to say that he told us.  We had no idea.  Kelly, what are you going to do? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, where are you headed?  I don't know.  In life.  You sure you're going to be okay with all of us?  You're not going to end up in Bellevue on a tape, are you?  You might see me on HBO.  On an HBO special?  You're going to be all right without the show and stuff?  Yeah.  You're going to come back and visit us?  Yeah, I'll come back and visit.  Why are you a star at Ocean Township Intermediate School?  My little sister.  Yeah?  13 years old.  Nice.  All her...  Does she wear a JonBenet cowboy hat?  All the little guys in her class listen to the show every day. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah?  Young boys, yes, dear.  Oh, okay.  So you're like a star there.  Yeah.  They put out my picture from the internet.  Yeah, I bet.  What do they do with it?  I don't know.  I bet they feel guilty afterwards.  I think they try to do it.  I bet clean up tons of bitch afterwards.  She said they laminated it, but I'm not sure.  Yeah, what kind of laminate is that?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, man.  So you have no plans?  What are you going to do with the time that you usually would spend here? 
[03:02:00]  Go to the beach.  The beach.  I'm going to have a lot more time on my hands because I'm not going to have to worry about  who's trying to pick her up around here.  Yeah, like all the guests wanted her.  It was ridiculous.  Thanks for protecting me.  We were protecting her like a little sis, right?  There you go.  Maybe she could move in the upstairs of your parents' house.  Maybe.  Like that other girl that disappeared many years ago.  Karen.  Karen.  For all the freaks out there that need to know everything. 
[03:02:30]  Right.  Yeah, where is Karen?  My long-lost sister.  Like a soap opera for God's sake.  All right.  Well, best of luck in any future ventures you may have.  Thank you.  That intern we didn't get rid of.  Yeah, really.  Actually, could you...  Yeah, you're the first intern in a while.  I made it through the whole program without getting fired.  Could you do one thing as your last duty?  Sure.  We're giving you the power to fire yourself.  Could you just fire yourself? 
[03:03:00]  Can Ben do it for me, please?  You want Ben to fire you?  No, because it's not going to be real.  Because Jesse, I hated his guts.  Yeah, it was very easy.  You.  Yeah, no.  Just let her...  All right, she's going to leave.  The next person that's going to get fired from our show, we will make fire...  They'll have to fire themselves.  Fire themselves.  The ultimate degradation.  Yeah.  Giving them the power to just fire themselves at the last thing they have to do.  Yeah, we can't have Kelly do that.  She was a great intern.  All right.  Helped us out a lot.  All right, Kelly.  Thanks, guys.  Bye-bye.  Bye. 
[03:03:30]  Even though we'll...  There she goes.  We'll see you after we end the radio show, but I guess for the radio audience.  For the radio audience.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Daddy's home.  Kelly, I miss you.  Excuse me, Kelly.  I had to chop her off at the North Shore Animal League.  All right.  Rick.  Hey, everyone.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I learned today that if I'm ever scuba diving and caught in a plane, I'll take my weight  belt off.  I'll fall a hell of a lot slower. 
[03:04:00]  See, we had life-saving rolls.  Nice.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Well, we got to get out of here.  Yep.  We got some skating to do, right, Stink?  Woo!  Doing some skating.  Skating and blading.  Skating.  It's not called rollerblading.  Rollerblades are on our brand.  It's called inline skating.  Inline skating.  That's right.  Stinky looks like a locomotive as he's puffing a joint, rolling down the...  No, Stink.  Stink, he kicks ass.  Yeah? 
[03:04:30]  We have a sick crew that go skating.  And every...  I hate...  His stinky rollerblade.  The smoke coming out of the top of his head.  We go, I don't know, once a week, we have a crew.  Psycho Mark's one of the guys.  Right.  And Dina Cola joins us and a few other guys.  And every time we go, look, let's just take it slow, enjoy the scenery, and have some fun.  And we...  By the end of it, we always are competing and just killing each other. 
[03:05:00]  It sucks.  Well, Mark has his new wheels that he buys, like, every two months.  Yeah, he's the biggest...  Look at that.  They're so fast.  And he has to prove to us how fast his new wheels are.  I made so much money at Fox, I can afford the best equipment.  I got a floating head on Foundry Music.  All right.  Okay, so tomorrow we'll see you guys on the road.  On the road.  The WOW road trip.  I don't know. 
[03:05:30]  This is something we...  Well, we invented this one.  I think it's just going to be a lot of fun to get out there, hand out some stickers, get  to a few towns, and just have some fun, you know?  Yeah.  I don't know if the show's going to be a clusterf or not, but we're going to have some fun.  And we're going to have updates on the Ron and Fez show starting at noon, because we're  starting at noon.  Yeah.  We've got lots of places to hit tomorrow.  Right.  And you can follow us.  Do whatever it takes.  We don't care.  The route is posted on WNAW.com and FoundryMusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com. 
[03:06:00]  All right?  Right.  Can we give away some of these, Ben?  Eight.  Eight pairs?  Yes.  Clear the phone lines.  Sting, clear the phone lines, because this is really cool.  We've got eight pairs of tickets to an exclusive listening party for the new Radiohead CD at  Lux in Levittown.  It's happening next Friday, plus all winners will be entered into a drawing to win tickets  to see Radiohead when they come to the tri-state area this summer.  Very, very cool.  The new CD by Radiohead will be in stores on June 5th, but if you want to go to the listening  party on Long Island, we'll give out eight of them. 
[03:06:30]  Eight pairs to some random callers right now at 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Thank you.  Thank you, please.  Thank you for listening.  Thank you, please.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Very good, please.  Thank you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and partying.  Hail to the kings of the radio.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. </pre>
