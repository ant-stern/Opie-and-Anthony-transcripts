<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts engaging in their characteristically crude and self-deprecating banter, questioning the purpose of their own show.  The conversation quickly turns to the recent Metro-North train derailment, with speculation that the engineer was texting while driving.  A caller, Jerry from Long Island, supports this theory, detailing the rigorous training of railroad engineers.  The discussion then shifts to Paul Walker's death, speculating on the cause of the car crash.  Following this, a highly graphic discussion ensues about Sharon Osbourne's vaginal tightening surgery, prompting a call to Dr. Steve for a detailed (and graphic) explanation.  Dr. Steve then provides equally graphic accounts of difficult childbirth experiences, including the use of vacuum forceps and the accidental breaking of a baby's collarbone.  Numerous callers share their own childbirth anecdotes, further enhancing the graphic nature of this segment.  The hosts briefly dismiss Amazon's drone delivery proposal as a publicity stunt.  Extensive profanity and sexually explicit jokes are prevalent throughout this part of the show.

The focus remains on childbirth, with Dr. Steve recounting more graphic and humorous medical stories, including a breech birth and a memorable (and inappropriate) finger placement incident. Callers contribute their own childbirth stories and jokes, some involving circumcision and the surprising use of foreskin.  The conversation expands to touch on childhood trauma and its potential links to adult behavior, referencing figures like Jeffrey Dahmer.  The hosts and Dr. Steve compare hospital and home births, discussing their respective risks. Listener accounts detail meconium and other birthing challenges. The show then briefly shifts to technical issues with the Sirius XM online stream, with the hosts suspecting sabotage.

A substantial portion of the show is devoted to Alaskan reality TV shows, with the hosts and an Alaskan caller debating their accuracy and entertainment value.  The conversation covers the harsh living conditions in remote Alaska, including sanitation challenges.  A gold miner caller details the high salaries ($120,000/year) but also the significant health risks, such as silicosis.  The Melvins' song "Honey Bucket" is played, fittingly following the Alaskan outhouse discussion.  An SNL skit about a baby-like adult man is briefly mentioned.

The discussion returns to gold mining, with caller "Harry" describing the process, including the use of cyanide and the depth of the mines (1200 feet).  A comparison between gold and coal mining follows, highlighting differences in environmental hazards and working conditions. The hosts then transition to a discussion of weather apps, comparing features and accuracy, before turning to their upcoming Christmas party and speculating about potential events (with humorous references to one host's genitals).  One host details his frustration with Google Plus and its automatic linking to his YouTube account, resulting in unintended uploads.  A video of his cat wreaking havoc in a Christmas tree is described in detail.  The conversation then shifts to animal rights, focusing on chimpanzees in medical research and animals in zoos, with caller anecdotes and a mention of Jim Brewer's Christmas song. A caller mentions a Texas law allowing medical research on certain convicted criminals. The segment concludes with the playing of Jim Brewer's "Santa Claus Ain't Coming to Town" and a brief discussion of other Christmas songs.

The show then delves into a purported hoax involving Joe Rogan, death row inmates, and medical experiments. This leads to a discussion of Ota Benga, the Congolese pygmy exhibited at the Bronx Zoo, including his living conditions and eventual suicide.  The hosts and callers discuss the hypocrisy of the Founding Fathers. The conversation continues with the revelation of Sam Kinisonâ€™s secret daughter via DNA testing, followed by a discussion of "Hottentot Venus," Sarah Bartman.  Lizardman, Eric Sprague, calls in to discuss his extensive body modifications.  Finally, the hosts banter with Roland, their producer, highlighting their often antagonistic relationship.  The broadcast ends with advertisements and plugs.

The final segment features Dennis Falcone, whose new mustache becomes the target of relentless mockery, described as a "pedophile mustache."  Tension between Roland and the hosts regarding guest selection is discussed, with an anecdote about a past incident with MTV VJs. Dennis's banana-phone Instagram post is mentioned. The hosts discuss listeners, promotional giveaways, and technical issues, including internet connectivity problems.  A listener calls in about a video of a hula-hooping woman wearing an Opie and Anthony shirt. Other unrelated listener calls are interspersed.  The Metro-North train crash is revisited, with speculation on causes and union involvement. A diamond jewelry advertisement is aired.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The European Central Bank  This is the Opium Anthony Channel  And now, a show  The likes of which America's never seen  So appalling, so offensive  Yet so entertaining  It's not your normal show  Beamed from satellites in space down to you  Every single day  It's the Opium Anthony Show with Opium  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio 
[00:00:30]  So shut the fuck up  And Anthony  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money  And I fuck attractive girls  And little Jimmy  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little  What?  Me, dang open, and only sit down here  Stop  Stop with that shit  I know  Here they are  Why, why, why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Good morning, everyone 
[00:01:00]  Oh, hi there, people  How's everyone today?  Folks  What happened?  Just addressing the imaginary group of people that we're chatting to  Yeah, you hope they're listening  Who the fuck knows?  It really is just a leap of faith here  Talking into these mics  There's no fucking video feed that shows us the people listening intently  I go home and think there's no use for this radio show 
[00:01:30]  Like, what are we doing?  We get together and we just talk  What does it mean in the end?  It means nothing  Doing such a service for the people  Then you have, like, strong opinions because you've got a microphone in front of you  Who gives a fuck  Absolutely  Yeah  What I say doesn't matter  This show doesn't matter  It's just wacky  It's like we have to get together and do this every day  For what?  I don't even know  I don't even know 
[00:02:00]  It's just the strangest thing ever  Really is a pointless exercise  Every day it's pointless  Pointless  It absolutely is pointless  It just goes  Hopefully entertain some people on the way to their jobs  Yeah  Maybe make them laugh  Maybe make them think a little  But if you really break it down  This is just nonsense  It's like everything else, though  None of us hang out when we're not here  There's little hangouts  But nothing, like, serious or deep  That means anything in the end 
[00:02:30]  No  That's true  Good morning, everyone  Hi, everybody  At least we're not driving a train and texting  Yeah  That's how it was  I'm saying it  I said it yesterday  And I'm sticking with that  Yeah  Because this idiot was going 82 miles an hour  When he had to get that train down to 30 miles an hour  The Metro North derailment, of course  Just north of the city  Right near, what, the Henry Hudson Bridge, I believe  And now they're looking at the train going 
[00:03:00]  Nothing wrong with the train here  Yeah  So they talked to the  I don't even know what they're called  Is he a conductor?  Is he an engineer?  Is he  What is he?  I would say the engineer of the choo-choo  Well, how about he dresses like one?  Yeah, he's kind of just like  He zoned out, he said  Well, this is my point  If he's admitting to zoning out  Because he's not stupid  He knows his business  And he knows they checked the train  And they know the train was fine  He has to say something  So if he's admitting to zoning out 
[00:03:30]  That means he was abso-fucking-lutely texting  Just like I said yesterday  At the beginning he said that the brakes didn't work  That was his first thing, right?  Well, of course you've got to say something  And you've got to hope that in the wreck  Something happens where it looks like  They destroy the brakes, right  So when that didn't happen  Right  Yeah  Now he goes to phase two  Phase two is like  Alright, I zoned out  But the real thing is going to be  I think texting  Yeah  And then I guess there's been a few other  You know, train derailments around the world 
[00:04:00]  In recent months or last year or two  And that's exactly what the reason was  Oh yeah  Yeah, the engineers were texting  Yeah, a little text-a-rooney  I wonder if he fell asleep  He said it went to  The throttle went to idle for six seconds  What's that mean?  I mean the  Does that mean that you have to hold it  And it goes idle?  Or can you hit it with your knee  And have it go idle?  I don't know  I think he's got to let go of it  He was texting  Maybe  He was texting  I don't think you'd fall asleep 
[00:04:30]  I think he was sexting  Yeah  He might have been sexting  Oh, damn  That last text is going to be a doozy  It'll be on the front page  Within the next day or two  People lost their lives for this  And it's going to be like  Hey man  I've got some good deals  Black Friday  My train in your tunnel  Right  I want you to suck my arms  That's right  I don't know  He either fell asleep  I doubt it  Or he was texting  I don't think there's any other options 
[00:05:00]  At this point  Maybe it was a suicide attempt  Trying to counsel  Just knowing that  A train could be going 82 miles an hour  And they've got to slow that fucker down to 30  For this  Like pretty much a dead man's curve  That doesn't  That doesn't sit well with me  No  And it's all up to some guy  You always think that there's something else in place  Just in case the human fucks up  Where the train can realize and do something  I don't know  In this day and age  They said that they're supposed to have things in place 
[00:05:30]  That do that by 2015  But um  2015  How about they have it in place now  What are we waiting for  Well they said they have to push it forward now  Because they're  Of funding and everything  And technology and what not  Ah come on  A little GPS  Imagine if you went on a roller coaster  And you had to depend on a fucking human being  For every corner and hill and turn  Right  Oh my god  That's pretty much what's going on here  Yeah  You're on like a fucking roller coaster  And this guy has to go  Oh that's right  This crazy curve is coming up 
[00:06:00]  I gotta slow this thing down  To 30 miles an hour  Yeah  And he hit it going 82 miles an hour  Wee  People are lucky they didn't end up in the river  Yeah  What the one train was  The nose of it basically  Was touching the water  Yeah  And how did the engineers survive  Are they in the back these days  How does that work  Nah  It must not have been a bad fucking  Derailment for the engine  Right  You know the engine probably just fell off  And the rest of the car is kind of whipped around 
[00:06:30]  But he's in the front car  Yeah  Okay  He's right up front  Good view  Oh so that's  That's  Alright so that  Yeah  That car doesn't look too bad  And then there was the ones on the side  That I would assume  Had the people that died  Yeah  Horrible  In the water too man  He stopped probably five feet from the water  He didn't stop nothing  The train stopped itself  Well yeah  But you know  I'm just saying  It stopped  Yeah  There was no stopping  This guy fucked up  Yeah  But they're lucky  That thing didn't go into the water  Where was Superman  To stop the train 
[00:07:00]  Yeah  On the track  There's no Superman  They didn't say that once in the movie Superman  No  Not the word Superman once  What  In the movie Man of Steel  They don't say Superman once  Why  I don't know  It's weird  I noticed that  Oh the newest one  Yeah  Because they probably would get sued or something  She says like  Super  And then they stop her  Why  And then  I don't know  I think it's kind of like  Not some copyright shit right  No I think it's just  Hokey to call him Superman these days  Maybe  Maybe they were trying that whole angle  Oh really 
[00:07:30]  I don't know  I didn't even know  Isn't it hokey to have a movie like that  To begin with  You'd think  The red cape's a little hokey  Exactly  Yeah  The stupid cape that obviously wouldn't  Wouldn't fly whatsoever  His dumb cape  You would think they would have a better flying apparatus for Superman  They say Superman once in the movie near the end  Okay  Yeah it's coming in  I don't know  But why though  Eric you know  No I don't know why they  I know they're making the character darker  But I don't know why they weren't saying Superman 
[00:08:00]  Uh oh  Oh oh  You gotta make all superheroes darker  In character  Because every time they try to reboot it Superman's failed  Because no one gives a shit about a clean cut superhero  Yeah I guess so  So he's gotta have some demons right  Well that's why during all the fight sequences  People were dying  And he wasn't saving them  He was just fighting  Um  Yeah it was pretty fucking  Yeah it was  It was  Yeah there was shit blowing up  And  Yeah  They're throwing train cars at each other  And yeah  Falling out of buildings 
[00:08:30]  He was just beating the shit out of Zod  But not helping everybody else  Like he would in the other movies  So  Yeah  Alright we got  We got engineers pissed off at us  Oh yeah  Yeah let's go to Jerry on Long Island  Jerry  What's up guys  Long Island Railroad huh  Yeah  Yeah  Anthony that train was being pushed by a locomotive  Not pulled  Was it  And uh  Yeah  The uh  The engineer was in the back of the train  Oh  They were actually pushing  They were pushing that towards uh  Manhattan  That sounds very dangerous  Huh  He had to 
[00:09:00]  He just prick had to have been on the phone  I mean there's no two ways about it  There's so many signals  And  Fail safes  Maybe not  Mechanical  But enough  To know  He's rode that route before  And uh  It's gonna come out  Like you said  He's gonna be texting his buddy  He's like  Hey man  And then  People die because of him  What's the possibility  That he actually fell asleep  I don't think man  I mean  You're  You're so aware  You're at least you should be  The guy that's a 20 year vet  I mean he should know  Like I said  It's not the first time 
[00:09:30]  He was put on that  On that route  So I would say  He didn't fall  So I'm going with  Like you said  Yesterday there  Uh  Anthony  I mean  Opie that uh  He was texting  But I mean  The train program  That the Long Island Railroad  Goes through  Is so rigorous  And these  Jokels up at the Amtrak  It's not even close  To what you go through  For the uh  Long Island Railroad  So  They want you to  They want you to  They want you to be perfect  Every day  Right  Because of things  Just like this  So  This guy's uh 
[00:10:00]  And probably  I mean be honest  It probably  It probably gets boring  After a while  When you really  You know  Know your job  It's just like  You guys complained  This morning  About your job  Right  It's the same  Anything you do  It's just gonna get boring  I know right  Especially if you're pushing  You don't get to see anything  Except the fucking  The butt end of a fucking car  Right  You're not even  You're not even  Looking out the window  Oh man  You can't even see  Where you're going  You're barely  Paying attention  Because you've done it  Over and over again  For so long  So then you start  Thinking to yourself  You know what  I could probably do 
[00:10:30]  A little texting  Right here  I'm gonna text  And then you get into  What you're texting about  And next thing you know  You're like  Oh fuck  Just another word  Fuck I misspelled it  Right  Let me check how  That's spelt  And there you go  And that's how  Things happen  The newer engineers  Believe it or not  Are more safer  Than the guys  Who have 20 years on  Because these guys  Come out of like  Their training  So aware  And so afraid  Is the correct word  That the newer guys  Are better  The older guys  They don't even know  What the signals mean  Half the time 
[00:11:00]  And there's different  Signals for different tracks  And different tracks  For different  Can I ask you a question sir  How do they push  How do you push  A car like that  Like I don't understand  How that works  And how do you see  Where you're going  You don't see  Where you're going  You're just relying  On the train  You've been given  And you just run the train  How do you know  When to go left  Or when to slow down  Like how do you know  What to do at any moment  Is there something on the track  Yeah there's signals  That you'll see  On both sides  That give you  A heads up  Of what's to come  Okay 
[00:11:30]  And you just know  Not like I said  These guys run the same routes  All the time  It's not like they  You know  They know the railroad  Yeah like the back  Of their hand  And that's what  I'm getting at  So you start  The training  The training you go through  Is ridiculous  I mean  You have to write  From memory  Just for the Long Island Railroad  Penn Station  To Montauk  And you have to get  Every station  Every switch  Every signal  Perfect  If you mess up  One switch  You fail out 
[00:12:00]  Of the program  And that's  Your final  Of your fifth test  Of the day  Wow  So it's insanity  You have to be perfect  And it drums home  They're thinking  Because of shit like this  How many stations  Are there?  There's you know  Well over 45  60 all along  Alone  You know  Wow  So  It's crazy  So it's almost impossible  To have the train  Going 82 miles an hour  Into a 30  Yeah by itself  Absolutely not 
[00:12:30]  This guy was completely  In control of that train  And not to mention  Jim you said before  That it went idle  Six seconds  I forget exactly  What you said  It went idle  Six seconds  After it derailed  This thing was doing  The idle was at  Whatever  Until six seconds  After the fact  Not during  The actual  Into the turn  He went into the turn  82 and then  Oh shoot  Everything started  Going wooey wooey  And six seconds  After it stopped  It was derailing  Technical terms 
[00:13:00]  He's using  So maybe  Maybe he was sleeping  Before I know  But there's  Definitely  It's all human error  Yeah it's pretty obvious  It's human error  It was obvious  When we saw this  Yeah  A couple days ago  So  Alright  I mean  Punching out boys  Have a good day  Thanks for the knowledge  Jerry  You're welcome  Next stop  Hoppog  Hoppog  Next stop  It's like a train  Could derail easier  By pushing it  Yeah  Seems to me like  Right  You go around a curve  And it's being 
[00:13:30]  Just line of cars  Being pushed  As opposed to one  Pulling the rest  Of it  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  See  That's on the front page  Of our paper today  That's a biggie  I guess they don't  Turn trains around  This day and age  What do you mean?  Well if they get  From one station  To another  And then they gotta go back  Right  They just go in reverse  Instead of  Probably saves a lot of time  To do it that way  The old days  You put them on a roundhouse  Right  Remember the roundhouse 
[00:14:00]  It was like a  Lazy Susan for trains  And then they'd  Pop them on there  Turn it around  And that was it  And then send them  The whole thing around  Or just one?  I think just the engine  Okay  And then  Yeah  And then  They would be facing  The other way  I don't know  I don't know much about  Choo-choo's  Except they're pretty cool  To play with  As far as  Electric trains go  They're not  No?  No  As a kid I loved them  No they're cool  For maybe a half hour  Yeah  What else can I do with this?  And then they start  Setting up all sorts of shit  So it's  Shit to  Crash into 
[00:14:30]  Right  Then you take the turns  Really fast like this guy  You put stuff on the track  Yeah  Put your little brother's foot  On the track  Whatever it takes  Hot wheels  Cars  Yeah we've talked about  I mean  Toys are cool for about  A day or two  And then you gotta find  Other ways to  To use them  My dad has old  Lionel trains  Like really old  Wow really?  Yeah man  Collectors love that shit  They do right?  Yeah they do  I don't know anything  About them though  No?  No  They're probably worth like  A hundred dollars or something 
[00:15:00]  I would hope more than that  Yeah it's probably nothing  Well you don't know though  You ever think you have  Something valuable  And you go on ebay  And you're like  This is fucking gold  And it's like worth  A dollar seventy  You're like oh  Right  It's worth nothing  I thought I cherished this  I cherished this  I carried it from apartment  To apartment for years  Yeah this is my nest egg  Right exactly  I don't know  Do they like that damn tree last night?  It's Wednesday  Oh I thought it was  I thought it was yesterday  I asked my cabbie  If they lit the tree  As he was dropping me off 
[00:15:30]  I said do they like the tree?  He goes yes  Excellent gas mileage  What?  What?  That's exactly what he said  I asked him  He starts talking about his dumb car  What an idiot  Really?  It's a stupid car  He knows nothing  No he didn't  It's all about his car  He missed the gist  Yes  Happy birthday to Ozzy Osbourne  Yes  65  Wow  65 for Ozzy  Jesus  Ozzy's  Why is Sharon Osbourne 
[00:16:00]  Telling everyone  That she got her pussy tightened?  I guess they asked her  And she's pretty honest  She likes everybody to know  She's a nice tight vagina  I was pregnant  I respect that  Yeah  You think it was Ozzy?  You think it was Ozzy's girth  Or the kids' heads?  Oh jeez  Probably a combination  They got big melons  Those kids  Oh it's gotta be  Gotta be  The children  I bet  I bet it's all Ozzy's cock  Yeah  All Ozzy's cock  Yes  Really?  Absolutely  Always give credit to the cock  When you can  All Ozzy's cock  Of course  Ozzy's cock  It's huge  That sounds ridiculously painful 
[00:16:30]  To tighten up a vagina  How do they do that?  What do they do?  Do we have one woman out there  That had this done  So they could tell us?  I bet there's some  Cutting of meat involved  And stitching up  Where it was  Really?  Yeah you gotta take out  Some real estate  I'm thinking  Let's wake up Dr. Steve  Ah  Let's wake up Dr. Steve  Well the labia minora  Has to be eliminated  To an extent  And then we  You have to slice it  And then you go in there  And you tighten it up 
[00:17:00]  It's kind of the way  You take like a piece of fabric  Like let's just say  You're doing your  Your suit of your shirt  And your socks  And you're  Tightening up the inside  Of the walls  And the embryonic fluid  Will leak onto your fingers  Yeah  Yeah we'll wake up Steve  And find out how that's done  How that's done  That is exciting  Now the Paul Walker crash  He was only going  40 to 45 miles an hour  That was it  That's all it takes  And he was going around  A little bend  Oh he was supposed to be 
[00:17:30]  Only going 15  It was one of those  Type of deals  Whoops  15 mile an hour zone  They were going  40 to 45  He was just in a car  With some guy  He just like  The guy was like  Hey take a ride with me  Yeah but they weren't  Doing anything crazy  No  They weren't drag racing  The car was going  40 to 45 miles an hour  Around a bend  With 15 mile per hour  Speed limit  Dangerous fucking  Mechanical failure  May have also contributed  To the crash  I doubt it  That car looked like  It was  Yeah  It looked like 
[00:18:00]  It was brand spanking  New there  Didn't it  It fucking  I love  That burst in a flames feature  Could be  Taken care of  Holy shit  Maybe that shouldn't happen  Right  The hell were they  What did they have  In the car  Yeah  Nitroglycerin  Dynamite bumpers  Right  And then I guess  TMZ's got slow  Slow-mo footage  That's from a security camera  Sam was telling me  This morning  Yeah it's kind of  Behind trees  Is there anything  To see there  Or they're just  Trying to make more  Of it  They're showing it  On the news up here 
[00:18:30]  Oh really  Yeah  Yeah they show  Like there it is  Boom  What  Thing blew up  In a second  I don't see it  Fucking burst in a flame  It's behind a tree  TMZ's got it  Slowed down  So where's the car  Um  Boom  Right there  In that little  That's all it was  Everything's on video  But that's all it was  It's kind of in the distance  It's a shitty security camera  Fire  And then a giant fire 
[00:19:00]  Immediately  And how  And why couldn't  They get out of the car  They were knocked out  They were only going  40 to 45 miles an hour  Though  Explosion  Airbags  Nothing  That thing exploded  That's fucked up  Did it roll before it hit it  Or did it just go  Straight into the pole  Looks like it just kind of went  You know  It was a turn  They were going a little  Too fast for the turn  I guess  Even though  40 to 45 miles an hour  Is not a lot  Yeah  And then  I don't know 
[00:19:30]  We'll find out more  In the coming days  Poor beastids  Yeah  Being on fire must suck  I was watching horrible footage  Last night  Of some mob  That set a guy on fire  Trying to get to go to bed  Jesus  And just the idea  Of being on fire  Terrible it must be  That seems horrific  The guy kept crawling out of the fire  And they just kept  Throwing him back on it  Really?  Just awful  Why would you do that?  I don't understand that  They 
[00:20:00]  Yeah  People on fire  Looks like it's  Like really painful  Right away  And then you just kind of  Like move real slow  While you're on fire  Right before the end  You're just kind of like  Ah  Well  I'm on fire  It's terrible  It probably burns  Everything away that hurts  Yes  Yeah  It burns all the hurt parts  All the hurt parts  Yeah  Yeah  I have info on the crash  How does Richie from Long Island  Have info on the crash?  He knows nothing  Ah Richie  Hey guys  How you doing? 
[00:20:30]  I'm doing good  What's up?  I just want to throw something  Into the bucket there  That car was a Porsche  Ferrari GT  When it was made  Several years ago  It was a $450,000 car  And one of the interesting  Things about that car  Is if you don't know  How to drive  You're going to die  In that car  Going 45 miles an hour  It's very unforgiving  So I could see this guy  Coming down  At 45  Going into a 15 mile an hour  Curve  And this car  Is just going to  Hit anything  And explode 
[00:21:00]  It's made out of  Carbon fiber  Shatter like a toothpick  The guy driving it  Was a race car driver  Right  Ex-race car driver  So I'm right  He wasn't very good  At it  Well they said  It was a mechanical problem  It might have been  A mechanical issue  On the car  I'll tell you one thing  Any sports car  Should be able to take  A 40 mile an hour turn  A 15 mile an hour turn  Delivery drones  Amazon shocks world  With new proposal  We already explained  This to everybody  It's nothing  It's a publicity stunt  We gotta get  We gotta be taken  More seriously 
[00:21:30]  They're not delivering  Your packages  With drones  Yet  People think  But they could easily  Say that  Like yeah  Of course it's a possibility  That you could use drones  To deliver packages  But it's not happening  Anytime soon  Fucking these  These news channels  Gotta say  Hey man  This is a publicity stunt  They got  Amazon's got everyone  Talking about them  Which is brilliant  On their part  So pretty good meme there  With Obama  What do you mean  It's pretty funny 
[00:22:00]  Saying to Amazon  He goes  Look  I'll give you some  Working drones  If you give us  A working website  See cause  He's got the drones  Right  And Amazon's got  A website that works  So they could do  A little trade  A little trade  Sure  Honey I'm telling you  Come to the window  I just saw  A flying object  They will be justified  And I know Santa  Santa is lobbying  Against the reindeer  Don't stop saying  Santa  Other adults  They do not want  To be showed up  By a drone  Santa  Don't drone me  Who does  Drone drama 
[00:22:30]  What do you think  Do you think  This is a good idea  To have private companies  Deliver things  Via  Drone  It's not  At this point  You know  My neighbor dog  Would definitely  Cart something off  What do you think  Email us right now  Friendsofoxys.com  Playing sound effects  Oh my god  Fuck the fuck this morning  It's a fucking  Publicity stunt  I hope his neighbor dog  Isn't watching  His neighbor dog  Drones aren't delivering  Your packages  Anytime soon  Stop it already 
[00:23:00]  They're not gonna  Allow that  There's so many  Issues involved  So many  I'd love my Cialis  To come by package  You hit a button  That would be cool  Five minutes later  It's right there  Where is Cialis  On the package  Everybody can see  Because for the  Business model to work  They're gonna have  To have hundreds  If not thousands  Of these in the sky  At any given moment  It's not  It's not happening  And then they'll  Forget about it  About a week or two  They'll forget  They even did that story  And then Amazon  And their offices  Are like 
[00:23:30]  Yes we did  Yeah right  Right around  Christmas  And they'll be  Patting each other  On the back  Got so much attention  Around Christmas time  We got a bunch of  Publicity from the news  This is great  Yep  All right  Dr. Steve  Hey boys  Are you awake sir  I am  Now  Now  Yeah  So you got  Sharon Osbourne  She tightened up  Her vagina  And she says  That surgery was brutal  The worst surgery  She's ever had  And I guess  She's had a few  Things done  Over the years  Yeah  How do they  How do they 
[00:24:00]  Do that  How do they  Tighten up a vagina  Well  What it's called  Is vaginoplasty  And there's a bunch  Plasty  There's a bunch  Of different versions  Of it  Like sometimes  You can do  A vaginoplasty  To create a vagina  If you're  You know  Transgendered  For example  Yuck  Or if you're  Born  With too small  A vagina  No such thing  But also  You can use  The same kind  Of techniques 
[00:24:30]  Yeah  To tighten up  A kind of floppy  Flappy vagina  So  Right  It's  What they do  Is they  Basically  What they're  Trying to do  Is restore  The muscle tone  And the look  Of the vagina  And sometimes  They can just  Do a  Labioplasty  So if someone's  Got just  You know  Floppy meat  Curtains  They can just  Go in  And kind of  Slice those down  But now  Sam  Can tell you 
[00:25:00]  That this is  Well because  I've never had  My vagina worked  Well your vagina  Was made into a penis  We all know that  So that's what  He's getting at  And your asshole  Needs to be tightened  It's common knowledge  Floppy loose  Used anus  It's like a cock highway  He had surgery  In the same area  When he had  A certain position  And there's so many  Nerve endings  In this area  That when you cut it  It hurts like  A motherfucker  And I mean 
[00:25:30]  Sam can tell you  How bad it hurt  You can just imagine  The amount of tissue  That's taken off  In a labioplasty  Is you know  Three times  The amount  That's taken off  When you do a circumcision  So the pain  Is going to be intense  Alright  I've known you  For a really long time  You're just making up stuff  Because you don't know  How they tighten up  The vagina  Oh man  So you're distracting  And talking about  Floppy lips  And meat curtains  How do they actually  Tighten up the vagina  That's the question  Yeah fuck 
[00:26:00]  I don't know  There it is  You know how to  Shave that shit down  But we're talking about  Making you know  Things a little smaller  Yeah well  And I don't  I can't figure out  How they would do that  Can't they just  So  I've never been  Partied to that  But I have delivered  250 kids  And I have tightened up  A couple of vaginas  Afterward  How do you tighten  Up after  Well what happens  You know in childbirth  Is people will tear  And you know 
[00:26:30]  Sometimes they'll tear  All the way into the rectum  And you have to  Reconstruct the rectum  And you have to  Reconstruct the vaginal wall  And when you do that  You know  Obviously you're  You know  In the old days  Reconstruct that wall  Yes  In the old days  When that happened  You know women  Would just have to  Reconstruct their vagina  Themself  And when I talk about  The old days  I'm talking about  You know  For thousands of years  Before we had surgery  Well how would they  Reconstruct their own vaginas 
[00:27:00]  Well they'd have to  Just heal  And they  You would end up  With a vagina  That had contact  With the rectum  And you know  Birds have this thing  Called a cloaca  Where they shit and piss  Out of the same orifice  And that would kind of  Happen to women  You know  Who didn't heal properly  Ah  Cloaca  Like a bird  Sounds like a name  In the hood  Yo cloaca  So when you would 
[00:27:30]  Have a fourth degree tear  Which is what that's called  You know  The choke  In the operating room  Was did you make  A cloaca  And then you would  Hang your head in shame  And get to  Fixing the thing  So  You went out  But anyway  So when you do that  You're taking  Parts of vaginal tissue  And you're  Closely approximating them  And then sewing them together  So I'm sure  The vaginoplasty  Is the same sort of thing  Where they would go in 
[00:28:00]  And make an incision  Take out a section  Of vagina  And sew it back up  And you know  When you do that  It'll be  It'll be much tighter  Tighten it up  Nice  So  So anyway  You're right  I've never been  Partied to  An actual  Vaginoplasty  But I've done  Quite a few of them  Myself  During childbirth  So  Alright  There you go  Why don't you  Deliver children anymore  What happened  Oh no  When I graduated  From residency  It was like 
[00:28:30]  Fuck that  I'm not doing this  Yeah  You didn't like doing that  But let me tell you  Something  I wasn't wasted time  Because  Because I was very good  At doing pelvic exams  And I was very good  At you know  The diseases  And you know  Conditions that women  Go through  Unlike  Some people  Go through residency  And never do  Any female  Stuff  And then all of a sudden  Have to start doing it  When they get out  You ever have a dud  Come out  And have to tell the parents  Jesus  Yeah  No but I tell you what 
[00:29:00]  The last delivery I had  Was one of those  That the last delivery I had  Was the reason why  I don't do  All deliveries anymore  Why would happen  Oh it was so  Scary dude  I had  It was  How can I tell this  Without violating it  Well okay  I don't think there's  Any way anybody would know  Who this was  Or identify it  But the baby  Didn't  Wouldn't come out  Let's just say that  And I got them out 
[00:29:30]  And I got  You know  The head out  And couldn't get  The rest of the body out  It's called  Shoulder dystocia  And there was no  Attending position  Anywhere around  And I had one of these  Before  So I didn't  Just press around  The kid's head  Crack his fucking  Crack his shoulders  Yeah well  Okay so anyway  Wait what happened  So the head's popping out  But you can't get  The shoulders out  I can't get  The rest out  And that's one of the things  That you can do  Is you can break  Their collarbone  To get them  To kind of fold  The kid up 
[00:30:00]  Fold that little bastard up  What an unpleasant  Entry into the world  Oh I know  Did you break  His collarbone  Huh no  So I  I didn't know  How to do that  Because I'd never  Had one of these  He's Steve cut his head off  I put a bunch of  Pressure on this kid's head  Pressure pressure pressure  And I'm like  You know  And then all of a sudden  I hear this  Crack  Oh shit  And the baby  Comes blooping out  Right  So I'm like  Wait wait wait  I gotta slow you down  What do you mean 
[00:30:30]  You put pressure on the head  If the head's already out  Because the  Okay the head is out  Right  And you're standing  In front of the woman  Her legs are akimbo  Right  And so  You want to get  The top shoulder  To come out first  Right  So I'm putting pressure down  You know  Putting pressure on  Oh he's kind of  Pulling the head out  And pushing down  So the shoulder  Can pop out  He's pushing the head  Back in  To try to get the shoulder  Down toward the floor  Down yeah  Oh my god  Okay  Alright  Gotcha 
[00:31:00]  Alright  And I hear this  Crack  And then the kid  Comes blooping out  And I'm like  Oh my god  Please just  Look this kid over  Because I was sure  That just  Something horrendous  Happened  And so  And she  Tore  Obviously  So I'm over there  You know  Cleaning up  The tear  And  Look at Keystone  Cop in there  Aren't you  The nurses  Were looking over  This baby  And they said  He's fine 
[00:31:30]  Shoulders McGillicuddy  Popping out of there  If it wasn't  The kid  That made that noise  It had to be  The mom  So I'm checking  Her out  She's fine  It was nothing  It was just  A warning  From above  Don't  Do this anymore  Damn  That was the last  One I ever did  That was the last  One I was ever  Gonna do anyway  Right  But it was like  Hell I'm never  Doing that again  It's like the  Fucking last mission  Of the Memphis Bell  What does shoulder  Distortion  How do you get  Well why doesn't  Your shoulders pop out  Because the kid is 
[00:32:00]  Sometimes kids are  Too big  To pass through  The canal  And like  Either the mother  May not be  Have a real oval  Birth canal  Or the kid  Is just too big  But kids you figure  All that shit out  Before the  Get out  But the  Shores  Well  This was a long  Time ago  Dude  We weren't  Doing ultrasounds  On everybody  But I'm just  Saying  Can't you figure  All that  All right  Can't you figure  All that stuff  Out nowadays  Though  You study the  Canal  Like okay  You could  You could

[02:22:30]  Holy fuck  Go get that on iTunes, Santa Claus ain't coming to town  From our pal Jim Brewer  I like it a lot  Jim Brewer  Checked my Twitter during the break  And there's all sorts of  Oh, you want to play it?  You want to hear Dennis Leary's or Sleeves?  Which one do you want to hear?  Oh, I forgot Sleeves  No, no, let's go with Dennis Leary first  Oh, no  Jimmy likes this one  Yay  Old St. Nick's got bourbon breath 
[02:23:00]  It's so cold you can catch your death  I got sold me some crystal meth  It's a Merry fucking Christmas  I'll go home and get your fucking shine  I think so Christmassy  Spent up twinkling with frozen pee  My priest just sat on Santa's knee  It's a Merry fucking Christmas  Well, the kids go to bed each night  To dream what Santa's over  Oh, yes  This is going great  Crappy toys flying off the shelves 
[02:23:30]  Midget stressed out to look like  Oh, that's funny  I'm funny  Are you about to call me an asshole?  All the kids go to bed each night  To dream what Santa brings them  Unless they're Jewish or Muslim  Or some other gym religion 
[02:24:00]  Okay  Okay  I was only joking  Okay, fuck it  What's next?  And honestly, that is not the one I was thinking of 
[02:24:30]  Oh  What?  There's another one  Oh  Or am I wrong?  Why?  That sounded all right  No, I'm saying I thought there was two of them  That was good  Right?  Is that the only one he does?  No, there's  I know there's Merry fucking Christmas  But that's not him, right?  Merry fucking Christmas  Yeah, no  Is that the only one you're wrong?  This is the one I have here  Dennis Leary, Merry fucking Christmas  Oh, I guess  Maybe he sang it different when he was in the studio  It just sounded different  The chorus sounded different  Did it?  Yeah  I loved his Burn documentary 
[02:25:00]  Fucking terrific  A lot of people checked it out  Yeah, I'd like to see that  So there's a bunch of things  I checked my Twitter  First of all  The first problem is this  The guy calling about Texas is full of shit  That was a hoax from the internet  Joe Rogan talked about it on his podcast  Using like, what?  Death Row guys  Right  And doing medical experiments on them  So I guess that is bullshit  Bullshit  That seemed a little suspicious  Yeah  A little bit, right?  Definitely  It's going to take a few more years  For us to get to that level 
[02:25:30]  To where we're, yeah  Using convicts as fucking experiments  And then I was reminded by  One of my fine followers  About a guy named Ota Benga  We were talking about zoos  Yeah  Look up Ota Benga  O-T-A  I just retweeted the story myself  Ota Benga  Oh  Was at the Bronx Zoo for a while  As a exhibit  Really  And this was common  Back at  Back in the 
[02:26:00]  The very early 1900s  In the day  In the day  Because they were trying to show  Like, you know  Human evolution  Oh  They kind of did away  With the  With the Ota Bengas  Oh  Can you read up on Ota Benga  For everyone, Sam?  You've got the story in front of you  Yeah, it was September 8th  1906  Oh, Scarface  Ota Benga  September 8th, 1906  Is when New Yorkers 
[02:26:30]  Were treated to something novel  At the Monkey House  Oh boy  They even housed him  In the Monkey House  Monkey House  Poor Ota Benga  Was it a guy?  Huh?  Well, at first  Some people weren't sure  What it was  Yeah, they weren't  It, he  Seemed much less  A monkey  Than a man  Though a very small  Dark one  With grotesquely pointed teeth  Oh  He wore modern clothing  But no shoes  He was proficient  With bow and arrow  And entertained the crowd  By shooting at a target  He displayed skillet 
[02:27:00]  Weaving with twine  Made amusing faces  And drank soda  Whoa  The new resident  Of the Monkey House  Was indeed a man  A Congolese pygmy  Named Ota Benga  The next day  A sign was posted  That gave Ota Benga  His height  As 4 feet 11 inches  His weight  At 103 pounds  And his age  At 23  The sign  Concluded  Exhibited  Each afternoon  During September  Oh  That's nice  So he was from the Congo 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, he was from the Congo  They, uh  Some of the slave  Owners there  Sold some  Some of the  Last remaining slaves  To  To the zoo  To exhibits and stuff  Crazy  Do you think the zoo  Filed his teeth down  Or do you think  The slave owners  Did it to try to  Sell him for more money  To the zoo  Not sure  Whichever one of them did  I'm sure they read  The Constitution  Right before  Oh yeah  Felt good about it  Great land we live in  That reminds me  Of that  Little Rascals episode  Where they had 
[02:28:00]  That guy  And they thought  It was  Spanky like  Thought it was his uncle  Right  And he was chasing  Around the house  And he was a guy  He was some  Guy from  Far away land  And they were  Going to put him  In a zoo  And he was chasing  Him around  And that's when  Spanky said  You don't eat me  My mama says  I'm spoiled  Before the  And they got away  With that on TV  Yeah  Before the exhibit  Closed  I'm going to go back  To what Jimmy said  A little bit  Because I really 
[02:28:30]  Liked it  The Constitution thing  It closed very quickly  Yeah  But the second day  That it was up  There was an even  Better show  Otabanga  And an orangutan  Frolicked together  Hugging and wrestling  And playing tricks  On each other  The crowd loved it  Clint Eastwood later  Ripped that off  For a movie idea  She did  Dirty Harry  Oh Dirty Harry  To enhance the  Jungle effect  A parrot was put  In a cage  And bones  Had been strewn  About it  Ah  Like he like 
[02:29:00]  Ate it  Otabanga  Back to Jimmy's point  Are you saying  That the founding fathers  Might have been  A bit hypocritical  Slightly  And a bit full of  Shite  Yeah  But I guess  Things were different  Then they didn't realize  That a human being  Should have equal value  As another human being  And I'm okay with that  I'm okay with what we were  And what we are now  Like I just wish  We would be truthful  Like meaning  Stop pretending  That we're built on this  Fucking 
[02:29:30]  Amazing stuff  Just admit like  Yeah we fucking  Kicked the dog shit  Out of the Indians  Took all their shit  And took a bunch of  You know  If we said it honestly  I'd be totally cool with it  That's a  That's world history  No matter where you are  Where you go  That's true  Cause it's like  I don't think there's one country  Where people  The indigenous people  Stayed there  Built something up  And now they're a world power  This whole world  And humanity  Is based on the fact  That people  Explored  And conquered  And built  And were eliminated  And eliminated other people 
[02:30:00]  It's the way  I don't know why  The United States  Has to be so guilty  About its past  When it did nothing  More or less  Than every other nation  On the face of this earth  I agree  I don't think we should be guilty  Oh thank you  No I don't think we should  Stop talking  I think you're right  I don't think we should be guilty  I just think that we should be  Honest  With ourselves  Fuck the rest of the world  Cause we're too busy  Telling the rest of the world  How to live  But there's always this  All you hear about  Is how horrible  Americans were to the Indians  And how Columbus was a scumbag invader  And how we were horrible to slaves 
[02:30:30]  And how this  Like all we hear is that  What kind of honesty do we need  If all we're hearing  Is how awful we were  As a society  It's not even that we were so awful  Just admit the ugliness  That we were built on  I think it's been admitted  Ad nauseum  It's been kind of admitted  Reluctantly  I don't think there's one person  That doesn't know  The founding fathers  A few of them  We're slave owners  And we're still  We're still going around  Telling everybody else  How to behave humanely  That's stupid  I can't stand that bullshit 
[02:31:00]  And there are probably  A lot of people  That don't realize  Only 100 years ago  We had black people  In the zoo  Ota Benga  What do you mean  Ota Benga  Ota Benga  For a green card  I gotta carve him up  Real nice  Carve him up real nice  This was 1906  It was not  Is there more in Ota Benga  I'll find some Ota Benga  If you don't fucking have it  Yeah the exhibit  Didn't last long  And this was the  Why what happened  It was not  It was too humane  Too humane  There was 
[02:31:30]  There was a black clergyman  Named Reverend James H. Gordon  Who was also the superintendent  Sharpton's great great  Grandpappy  He was the superintendent  Of the Howard  Colored Orphan Asylum  In Brooklyn  Right  Yum yum  Eat em up  And he  That's what he was going to say  He made the point  Our race  We think  Is depressed enough  Without exhibiting  One of us  With the apes  Wow  Which even  I mean it's a great point 
[02:32:00]  He took a stand  Back in 1906  That's pretty righteous  He said  We think  This was the cause  Du jour at the time  Uh huh  We think  We are worthy  Of being considered  Human beings  With souls  Oh there you go  Well he's pushing  For that  How'd that work  How'd that work  Out for him  Yeah  Still working  In that person  Wow  I got more  I got more on Ota Benga  From Wikipedia  Benga had been freed  From African slave traders  By the missionary  Samuel Phillips  Werner  A businessman  Recruiting Africans 
[02:32:30]  For the exposition  He traveled with Werner  To the United States  At the Bronx Zoo  Benga had free run  To the grounds  Before and after  He was exhibited  In the zoo's  Monkey house  So he could  He could go  Come and go  As he pleases  Oh okay  He had to put  Put in a shift  At the monkey house  Go grab a fucking  Grazed papaya  Go on it  Yeah  Except for a brief visit  With Werner  To Africa  After the close  Of the St. Louis fair  Benga lived in the  United States  Mostly in Virginia  For the rest of his life  For his  For the rest of his  Short life 
[02:33:00]  Oh wow  He only made it to 33  33  That's pretty good  The mayor  Released Benga  To the custody  Of Reverend James Gordon  Who supervised  The Howard Colored  Orphan Asylum  Okay that's what  You were talking about  That same year  Gordon arranged  For Benga  To be cared for  In Virginia  Where he paid for him  To acquire American clothes  And to have his teeth  Capped  Oh he got caps  Well yeah  They must get the shit  Out of people  Walking around like that  So the young man  Could be more readily  Accepted in local society 
[02:33:30]  Benga was tutored  In English  And began to work  When several years later  The outbreak of World War I  Stopped ship passenger travel  And prevented his returning  To Africa  He became depressed  Aw  Aw shit  Did he kill himself?  He sure did  Did he?  Committed suicide in 1916  At the age of 32  Onibenga  Onibenga  That's not the name he said  Oh poor guy  He is  He was in Cuba  I  Killed communists for fun 
[02:34:00]  For a green card  I gotta  God  Liberdade  Liberdade  Liberdade  Liberdade  Hola  Ben  Hola  Ben  I missed this part  Displays of non-western humans  As examples of earlier stages  Of human evolution  Were common in the early 20th century  There you go  When racial theories  Were frequently intertwined  With concepts from  Evolutionary biology  It was all new  They didn't know any better 
[02:34:30]  Shouldn't put that guy in the zoo  There was no internet  There was no real other entertainment  What are you gonna do?  Who knew you shouldn't put that guy in the zoo  Next to the apes  We didn't know any better  We colonized the place  We come up with a constitution  A bill of rights for ourselves  Who knew you shouldn't put that guy in the zoo  Next to the gorilla  They were already building skyscrapers in 1904  Yeah I love them  I mean they weren't  You know massive  But they were considered skyscrapers  We knew enough  To know that we didn't like that shit 
[02:35:00]  That's why we left England  Like we knew enough  To know that religious freedoms were important  And our freedoms were important  It wasn't like we were just fucking drawing  Like a bunch of  Circles on cave walls  And nobody knew  I'll be honest with you  It probably wasn't sanctioned  By the US government  In 1900  This little show  That they put on with Ota Benga  Ota Benga  Ota Benga  Ota Benga  I'm sure it wasn't  A sanctioned thing  And you know  When somebody  Had a legitimate gripe about it 
[02:35:30]  They put an end to it  When the man said  Why wouldn't that occur  To them before the man said it  Yeah  So we're looking for  An ethical circus guy  Google image Ota Benga  I want to see if they have any pictures of him  That's him  No I know that  But I want to see others  Where he's maybe in a cage  Or playing with the orangutan  It's like Flip Wilson a little bit  It looked like a young Flip Wilson  I think  Ooh  Let me see  Those pointy teeth were  That's scary 
[02:36:00]  Absolutely was scary  Wow  Damn  I imagine they were filed  Painfully down  Oh my god  Painfully  You don't think they used like  The latest  A pencil sharpener basically  They didn't use the latest  In fucking  Pain relieving  Dentistry  They did  Yeah  Yeah  Hold your head still  You subhuman  While we fucking file your teeth down  For entertainment  Lovely  Oh my god  He looks happy there  Right  That's true 
[02:36:30]  He does  Smiling  Smiling  Yeah  Oh people are saying  That not Sam  Is Ota Benga's  Great great grandchild  Oh  I did not know that  I don't know that one  I wish he suffered the same fate  Love to see Sam  Tossed in a zoo  And humiliated  Tangled on by animals  Wrestling with the orangutans  Yeah  Just a loincloth  Trying to carve up his  Cork  Yeah they drag him around  By his awful fucking hairdo  They probably worship you  The orangutans  Thank you  Now the driver's saying 
[02:37:00]  From the Durrell train  That he did fall asleep  Oh wow  That's different than  Well  Earlier reports  Now he's saying that he fell asleep  Because it's not as bad as texting  Yeah  I don't know about that  But they're going to be able  To check that phone man  Oh one's a crime  That's right  You know what  Yeah if you fall asleep  He could blame it on like  Medical probes  Oh all of a sudden  It's going to be texting  I'm telling you  He's trying to cover his ass  There's no commercials  About sleeping and driving  No no  That texting  Is a motherfucker  I see it all the time 
[02:37:30]  It's scary now  And it's infuriating man  It's really fucking scary  On the road  People weaving all over  Their speed varies  By fucking 30 miles an hour  And you go to pass them  And there they are  Looking down  Fucking texting  Left lane  It's shit  I'm guilty of it too  I know it's terrible  Oh Jimmy  I know dude  I know  I know  No no no  Usually in Manhattan though  Sam has been there with me  I'm down too  I do it at a traffic light  Or if it's like  You know  Bumper traffic  And we're barely moving  I'll get a couple things  That annoys the shit out of me too  When somebody 
[02:38:00]  At the light  And it turns green  And they're not moving  And you know  They're fucking texting  I can't get on that horn fast  The best thing that happened to me  Was getting rid of that Blackberry  Where you could feel  The fucking buttons  The letters  Tactile  Well you felt like  You could really  Get some texting done  Yeah  But now looking down  For the individual letters  That's what finally made me stop  I don't know  Speaking of Blackberry  Why  He just  What happened  Just Kenny  Kenny  He's ridiculous  Did he get a new Blackberry?  Yeah  Six months ago 
[02:38:30]  Who has those  It's a piece of shit  And he hates it  He's obsessed with it  Why  And he knows it sucks  And he continues to use it  It's OCD  He got all excited  Because BBM came out for iPhone  And so I downloaded it  And I have one contact  On BBM for iPhone  It's because  Here's why  It's because he didn't want to  It's him  Yeah  It would have been  Cost $30 restocking  But he knew  Before he bought it  That it was a shitty phone  Yes he did  Why can't you move on  From the Blackberry?  Yeah  What's going on?  Yous are just jealous  No you're not  Oh that's what I would have drawn 
[02:39:00]  From everything that was just said  Jealousy  Yeah  By the way  While you're in studio  Thanks for the Sam Kinison stuff yesterday  That's a fucked up story  You're welcome  I also went to Whole Foods  And got you the green tea  That you like  Oh thank you  Wow Kenny  It has brown rice  It's roasted with brown rice  Why?  But you don't have the actual brown rice  What does the brown rice do?  It just makes it a little tastier  Because I'm trying not to drink as much coffee  So I'm doing green tea 
[02:39:30]  No one gives a fuck  Why are you talking about this?  Oh does brown rice give it a little coffee taste?  Gives it a little taste?  A little roast  A little roast  Taste  It's alright  Coffee's way better  But I've decided  I don't want my heart pumping  Out of fucking control all day  Doesn't it bother your stomach  The green tea?  It fucks me up man  No  I'm way more alert  Since I dropped the fucking coffee habit  I had brown rice for dinner last night  You did?  Oh wow  And chicken  How was that?  Grilled chicken  Sounds great  Everything you do is boring  Everything you do is boring  Everything you do is boring  Grilled chicken and brown rice 
[02:40:00]  That sounds horrendous  Then it's off to bed  And I do eat that but  Yeah  I treated myself to a lemonade  Did you  He always orders that one on the road  It's humiliating  Lemonade  It's just a big galoot  1,800 refreshment that is  Yeah  Give a mint julep  I need a lemonade  I'm going to the band shell  Yeah  Hey Kizzy  Could you get me a water?  I'll bring it to the gazebo  A lemonade every once in a while  Maybe in the summer is fine  But  Who picks that as their treat  Yeah 
[02:40:30]  It's a Doc Holiday fucking beverage  When you go with a Dr. Pepper maybe  A little root beer  Oh me and Sam love Dr. Pepper  Fuck yeah  Yeah  You like it too, Kenny?  Yeah  I got a great Dr. Pepper story  No, I bet you have a Dr. Pepper story  Tell him, Kenny  Five me out  Ew  What's the Dr. Pepper story?  When we were in Cleveland  Yeah  You know on a  Oh, I remember this story  A nice trip that the company used to send us on 
[02:41:00]  This one's embarrassing  It worked though  Yeah  It was good  And a lot of people went to the strip club  Yeah  And me and Sam went  And we stayed for five minutes  Because it wasn't our scene  Yeah, a bunch of girls  Showing their  Not your seams  Yeah  Who wants to see those big tits and pussies  Yuck  Get out of here  There wasn't much going on  Believe me  Okay  So we left  And we went back to the hotel bar  And cleared off a little  I was hoping 
[02:41:30]  But I couldn't close the deal  Look, he looks around the room  For approval  Yeah  That would work  So, um  Jonathan was in the bar  Conversing with strangers  Like you  Was he trying to explain  What that thing in the front of his pants was?  Is it actually attached to him?  So  Everyone  I asked Sam  If he would join me for a beverage  And he accepted  So you pulled your cock out  But I outsmarted him  Because we went to the gift shop  And I purchased two 20 ounce bottles 
[02:42:00]  Of Dr. Pepper  Embarrassing  And the gift shop was right across from the bar  I remember  And then we went into the bar  And I ordered  Two glasses of ice  Oh no  And Kenny and I each  Individually took our bottles  Out of our coats  And opened them up  And poured them into our glass of ice  Much better than a strip club  Yeah  Whoa  And then we got like  You know  Three sodas 
[02:42:30]  For the price of one  You know  Both of you  If someone said  What'd you do tonight  You both could have justifiably said  I had soda with a dud  It was a great  Pepper  Yeah  How mad were they?  They got no money out of you  Well they were more mad  Because Kenny then  Bothered the waitress  For the rest of the night  Yeah  I'm just a public nuisance  Well yeah  We all know that  Of course  Just finding out  What her name is  In the beginning  And then shouting it  For the remainder  I'm a pepper  You're a pepper 
[02:43:00]  You should have sang this song  Yeah  So the Sam Kinison shit  Oh my god  Yeah  So Carla Bowe  Who was one of Sam's guys  They were close right?  They were pretty good friends  That's right  Yeah  To the end  And he was part of  Didn't he  He was there when Sam died  Right?  I believe so  Yeah he was  And he was part of  The Outlaws of Comedy  And all that  And then  I saw him open for Sam  A couple times  When I used to go to Rascals  He's hilarious  He was on fucking fire man  He was funny  And Carla Bowe  Has his daughter 
[02:43:30]  For many many years  And then he starts  Getting suspicious  So they did testing  And it turns out  It's Sam's kid  Sam Kinison has a kid out there  Wait what?  Carla Bowe  This is a fact at this point  Sam's daughter  DNA testing proved it  But he didn't know for a long time  He thought it was his daughter  And then he  I don't know  Let me break it down to you  Yeah please  Sam fucked Carl's wife  That's what I wanted to hear  Okay  Really?  Oh wow  And they had a kid  And  Right and they were supposedly good friends  Carl thought it was his 
[02:44:00]  But then I heard  That  Carl was told years ago  And maybe he wasn't  But I think the problem was  Because he sued to get his child support back  Right  But I think the problem was  My guess is that he couldn't prove  100% that he didn't know  Like he couldn't prove  There was probably no documentation  That he had been told  It was Kinison's kid  And then there was never  DNA testing done before that  But now it's been done  With Sam's brother Bill  It was process of elimination  Because it wasn't Sam's DNA  It was the brother's DNA 
[02:44:30]  Which is as close as possible to Sam's  As compared to Carl's  So it was a process of elimination  And the test is saying that  There's a  Zero percent chance  Zero percent chance it's Carl's  Right  And the percentage for Sam's kid  Is way up  But it could have also been  Sam's brother  But either way it wasn't Carl's  Right  Right  But it's not Sam's brother  I think Carl's ex-wife  Like said  Fuck you  The kid's not yours  And you know  And so then he tries  To get his child support back 
[02:45:00]  Because he spent a shitload of money  And the court said no  And I think  But I think mostly they said no  Because there was some case  That it said that  Yeah you should try to  Right these wrongs  But I think because  They couldn't prove  Amazing  That he didn't know  I tried to google him  And the daughter  There's no pictures of her  No  I don't know  They're keeping her  Whatever  Under wraps  Under wraps I guess  Sure  It's pretty wild  That Sam Kingston  Has a daughter out there though  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:45:30]  I wonder if she's funny  I wonder if she's doing  Stand up or anything  No he said  I don't know  No  I thought one of the articles  They said like  He went and saw her  In a play or something  Oh really  Yeah I could be wrong  Alright  What does this have to do  With Otabenga  Otabenga  Otabenga  Could you look up  Hot and taut Venus  What is that  Supposedly  I don't  Why am I trusting  A fucking listener  Am I crazy  No not like that  H-O-T-T-E-N-T-O-T 
[02:46:00]  Is one word  Yeah come on Sam  Yeah this is her  Okay  She was on display as well  Oh  She was exhibited  As a freak show  Who is that bitch  In 19th century Europe  Yeah the huge African ass  Is sometimes  Oh  It's called the hot and taut Venus  Yes  It's basically that shelf  That some women have  You could google hot and taut Venus  In a lot of these 
[02:46:30]  Will it come up  Yeah  These shelf asses  I've seen some of those  Online  Yeah  Little kids standing on one  To see a parade  There you go  You know that  Hot and taut Venus  Was that her name  When she was on display  Yes  And what was  What was her deal  And where was she on display  In Europe  Like in England  And stuff like that  And she had a big fat ass  Yeah but  So people would come  From miles around  To look at it  Just to see it  Of course  What's that about  It's amazing  Well they probably 
[02:47:00]  Didn't have a  Large population  Of people that  Looked like that  So they couldn't  Really see it  And no real strip clubs  Maybe some burlesque shows  But it was a free  Cheap thrill  Sarah  Sarah Bertman  Or  Beertman  Bartman  Bartman  Bartman  Her name's Bartman  Bartman  Very cool  Yeah  And she went to France  Yeah see  She got to travel around  Cause that age  Well she sold  Sold to a person in France 
[02:47:30]  Did she see London  Sold or get to go  Did she see France  She first saw London  Then she saw France  Right  How did she fit  In her underpants  But she  But she got to see France  Yes  I've never been to France  Me neither  Who cares she was  Sold to France  She got to see France  And then she may have  Died of smallpox  Ah  Pox on you and your family  But it could have been  Syphilis too  Not quite sure  Whore  Jesus  Wow history's fun 
[02:48:00]  There's all kinds of shit  Going on  Oh my god  They buried her in Paris  I guess  And there were  They wanted her family  In Africa  Wanted her remains back  And they were like  Get the fuck out of here  Said no  We are keeping it  Oh this is good  Yeah  Her skeleton and body cast  Were displayed in the French Museum of Natural History 
[02:48:30]  After she died  So she didn't even  So dignified  That she erased  She didn't even get to be  Her what  Rest in peace  Her skeleton  And body cast  Yeah  Really  She entered  The cast of her body  So you could then see  The big shelf ass  Oh yeah  Where she entertained visitors  Until her skull was stolen  In 1827  Oh my god  Just leave this thing alone  Tragic  Yeah  Eventually the skull was returned 
[02:49:00]  Okay  The restored skeleton and skull  Continued to arouse the interest of visitors  Until the remains were moved to another museum  When it was founded in 1937  And stayed there until the late 70s  Wow  1970s  Now where is it  Her body cast and skeleton stood side by side  Face to face  Bah bah bah  Did they eventually make wind chimes  With their skeletal remains  This poor woman  Trinkets  Jesus 
[02:49:30]  Leave her alone  At some point someone had to  Like speak up for her  And they had a barrier  Well it was the feminists  Oh  Oh really  In 1974  Right  The feminists started complaining  About the exhibit  Being  Degrading  As a representation of women  Troublemakers  And so the skeleton was removed  In 1974  And then the body cast stayed  Until 76  Wow  So where is the skeleton now 
[02:50:00]  I probably just threw it out  I don't know for sure  Oh god  They just threw it away  They just got rid of it  Dumped somewhere  Right  They were in the garbage  They were trashed in the garbage  All those years  Yeah  Awaiting judges ruling  On Detroit's bankruptcy  Oh  Well that  Isn't that a given  Well yeah  They're pretty bankrupt up there  Yeah  What does that mean  Like civil employees  Won't get paid  Or  Well it's  In this deal  You know that is the issue  That has brought these  Demonstrators out here 
[02:50:30]  To the courthouse  That you see behind me  And it boils down really  To a challenge  Between Michigan law  And federal law  Michigan law says  The pensions are sacred  You can't touch them  Oh  Federal law says  All creditors are to be  Treated equally  So the city would have  The same obligation  To XYZ bank  As it would to  A city employee  Who invested a career  On the job  And wants to retire now  So it remains to be seen  If the judge will somehow  Be able to set aside  Some 23,000 plus pensioners  And offer them  Some protection bill  Wow  So they might lose 
[02:51:00]  Their pensions  That's fucking disgusting  Holy fuck  That is fucking disgusting  So wow  Man  That's pretty big  Jesus  You work all those years  For a pension  And then they just go bankrupt  And you don't get it  Yeah they say  Fuck the pensions  They should have taken  The leadership  And fucking strung them up  That's the only way  To do it  By their heels  Like Mussolini  Yeah  We'll follow you  Go do it  Yeah  I'll be right behind you  That's the problem  Not  Good one Jim 
[02:51:30]  I thought you meant it  And then you said not  Sounded like he was gonna go  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah people are  Fucking pussies  They don't do anything  No the pygmies  We're learning more  They actually sharpen  Their own teeth  And there's a video  Oh okay  The vapid oid  Sam would you do it  Pick me  It means something different  Yeah there's a comma  Between those words  Kidding me  I don't go for that  And breaking news  The app is  All over the place 
[02:52:00]  Again today  Who calls me  Damn what is this  Help me mommy  Help me I'm dying  Oh that's great  Oh my poor son  You are suffering  Holy shit  They're chiseling his teeth  Sharp  And he just has to  Bite down on like a root  But that explains  Why it said  What's his name  The guy who was displayed  Stop it  That's enough  Oh Jesus 
[02:52:30]  Wow  So it's not just  It's just  The whole humanity  We're just shitty people  But they take some kind  Of national pride in it  Because after  What's his name  Who was in the zoo  Right before he killed himself  He took the  Caps off his teeth  Oh he did  Yeah  Oh man  The caps hurt  Don't make such a fuss  Oh come on  Don't make such a fuss  I'm just telling the kid  Don't make such a fuss  They don't even file them  They're chiseling his teeth sharp  I bet you hit the nerve  Once in a while  Nice tits  And everyone's laughing  Yeah  Jesus 
[02:53:00]  Oh this poor kid  Now you can't eat  For a fucking  Exactly  Now here have this  Saliva broth we made  Yeah  Where the whole fucking tribe  Spits into it  Oh  He was spitting  God the agony of that  Who decided that  One idiot had to decide  This a long time ago  Tribes are idiots too  Let's sharpen our teeth  Oh  Gotta hunt  Little guy  What's he gonna do  Bite something in the throat  Oh he's drooling  You know how much  That must fucking hurt  Can we find out  Why they do that 
[02:53:30]  What's the reason  Is it because of the rain god  What is it  I wonder if it helps you  Eat better  Or it helps you tear things  Yeah rip through  Fucking rhino ass  He's drooling all over  His Superbowl champ  Buffalo Bill shit  Humans are just  Yeah we are  We are just weirdos  It's just fucking weird  That's some crazy ass shit  Right there  People in the comments  Comparing it to circumcision  Oh really  It's also  I've turned against circumcision  Not me 
[02:54:00]  Oh cause you saw it  Oh I didn't actually  I was in the room  Taste bad  Yeah  No I prefer the way it looks  I like peeling one back  No it's just  I just  The unnecessary  I understand the health benefit  But it's just stupid  Let those babies get snipped  You don't want to do it  When you're 19  Yeah yeah  It's just the way  They make the decision  For the kid  To take the tip of his cock  It's agonizing  I just guessed  By the time he can make  His own decision  It would be a lot harder  Yeah it is  So yeah  Sam knows  So just do it 
[02:54:30]  Yeah I mean  It's not pleasant  But there's plenty  Of unpleasantries  That have to happen  When you're a kid  Cause as bad as it hurts  The baby  It's a baby  They forget real quick  Yeah  Yeah sure they do  Our whole lives  We don't forget  Your whole personality  Is formed before you're two  What do you think  Having your cock  Butchered by some fucking guy  With bad breath  Yeah it's  And lights in your face  While people you trust  Hold you  I don't know  I don't remember anything  About that circumcision  Yeah but it's  I think it's just  Deep inside your fucking  Soul at that point  I remember inoculations 
[02:55:00]  We can't just  That hurt  We just can't define it  Booster shots  Booster shots  Those hurt  And I remember those  Dude  Most human beings  Are irritable assholes  You can figure it out  Yeah  It's all the shit  That is done to you  Before you're five years old  Let's do a study then  And see if people  Are less of an asshole  If they have fucking  Foreskins or not  If it doesn't pan out  That way  If there's just as many  Assholes  Believe it or not  I think Hitler  Had a foreskin  And so  British people  Generally  Are dickheads 
[02:55:30]  Well that's true  They're also generally  Not circumcised  That's why they're dicks  Because they go to tinkle  And they squeeze it  And some cheese  Falls off the top  Well would you like  To avoid that  Wow  I don't know  They don't know why  They sharpen their teeth  They gotta hunt  I'm sure it's a thing  That makes them look vicious  To enemies  You know  What's the real answer  I'm sure that's it  Otabanga again  Hey there he is 
[02:56:00]  Well he's definitely  The most famous  Sharpened tooth person  No kidding  They have him in the  Wikipedia  The picture in the  Wikipedia section  Where it's human tooth  Sharpening  Historically many  Cultures have practiced  This form of body  Modification  And Bali teeth  Were filed down  Because it was thought  That the teeth  Represented anger  Jealousy  And other similar  Negative emotions  See it's  For some dumb reason  The teeth were also  Sharpened  That's Bali  As a rite of passage  For adolescents  Teeth filing was also  Used by aborigines  But why can't they  Just give the kids 
[02:56:30]  A tattoo or something  Don't they circumcise you  When you're an adult  Like in Africa too  When you turn  16 or 17 or something  I don't know  That's a nice  Fucking sterile  Painless  No I doubt it  Procedure  Oh  Oh hell  Oh my  So the reasonings  Are kind of  They're all over the place  Imagine biting your tongue  By accident  When you're those sharp teeth  It's bad enough  With regular teeth  I know you  They're trying to sing  Take me out to the ball game  Eat some cracker jacks  Hey  Examples in the modern world 
[02:57:00]  Could you read that  Next line please  Yeah I can  Alright  The first example  In the modern world  Is in fact  Boda Banga  Boda  My man  Love you  Miss you Oda  A Congolese pygmy  Imported to a zoo  In the United States  Whose front teeth  Were sharpened  When he was a young boy  That doesn't  That doesn't make  The white man look good  Yeah  You put Oda Banga  Into the Bronx Zoo  You know how much  That was hurt  Having your teeth chiseled  Oh  There's  There's three examples  In the modern world  One is Oda Banga 
[02:57:30]  And another is  Dee Snider  No  Why  It says he had  It goes from Oda Banga  To Dee Snider  No one in between  It says he had his  Incisors sharpened  Incisors  You dunce  Incisors  I didn't have my shit sharpened  Your vampire teeth  I have a  I always voted  Boy with the sharpest incisors  Eight years in a row  Oh yeah  It was a contest I held  In my house  You do have very sharp  Little vampire teeth  Oh I know I do  I know I do  All the true blood girls  Love me  Do they 
[02:58:00]  And that's nice  Some people get it done  Just because  They think it looks cool  Like they're  Yeah but not all of them  Like that  I think the little doll  In that trilogy  Of terror movie  Had um  Sharpened teeth  Michael Jackson on TV  Oh that's scary  He's dead  Oh  Some woman named  Fucking Sharon Levine  Jesus  Oh yeah look  She's  What did Dee do  Deferred too huh  He got his teeth sharpened  Are they still like that  The front teeth  Oh his incisors  I think they're fixed now  Maybe he did that  Yeah and then 
[02:58:30]  And then he had him  Yeah see  He had him capped  It's like fuck that shit  But doesn't uh  What about that lizard dude  Who did the show  I was thinking of him  Yeah  Oh yeah okay  His name is Lizard Boy  Yes the lizard man  Did it right  Yeah  And then he split his tongue  What an asshole  Would you split  Would you split  Your cock like that  No  What  Didn't we have  One of these guys on  We had that guy on  Oh yeah  Do you ever see a split cock  No  Google a split cock  I'm telling you  We've seen the split cock  You have  Sam has  No 
[02:59:00]  Sam you gotta see it  It's like a hot dog  That's been on the grill  Too long  Too long  Yeah it splits  Why would you do that  It's so gross  It looks like a crab claw  Who are you mad at  That's fucked  I'm like the lizard boy  You wouldn't do that to your beings  Why did that guy come in again  To show off his lizard boy  We had a rock  And we didn't know what to do  With it  So we gave it to him  As a chair  Get it  She's lizard  The lizard man  He's completely tatted up  I know  From head to toe  And then he split his tongue  He's got the implants 
[02:59:30]  Where his eyebrows  Are supposed to be  Oh right  I hope he wakes up one day  And just realizes  He doesn't like lizards anymore  Oh man  What a silly goose  He's gonna feel like  He must have been  Extremely boring  Cause I had to ask  If we had him on the show  He looks like that  And I don't remember  That he was on our show  He did stunts  Oh hold on a minute guys  That aren't active  I'm about to turn  All of your radios on  You can listen to SiriusXM  For free  Until December 3rd  Oh man  If you call the number  On this screen  You'll get a great offer  But uh  I didn't tell you that 
[03:00:00]  In fact  You did  I was never here  But you were  Uh oh  There he goes  He's hitting the button  He's gonna be so pissed  When he finds out  That was televised  I know  I know  Especially  And the companies  Didn't realize  They're blunder  Who was he talking to  When he said  But I didn't tell you  Yeah  Secret  Button  And it says  Button  Inactive radios  Turned on  It's very simple  Yes  I think they'd cover  That button  Or remove it 
[03:00:30]  Why make it so big  Yeah it's a big  But it's a very punchable  How come they don't  Bumped into it  With their shoulder  Yeah  Who came up with  The brilliant commercial  Do you think  Oh boy  Who do you think  I got it  I got it  I got it  Mark Goodman  I mean you know  His face is all over the place  I don't know  And he does an alright job  But I mean the  Commercial itself is  You don't think  They hired writers  Oh man  Oh yeah  There was probably  Some huge fucking  Company that came on board  Bunch of admin  They all jerked each other off  Oh yeah 
[03:01:00]  This is it  This is it right here  I know it  And it looks so bad  Like it looks like  They used an old VCR  Fucking  Dude they filmed it  In 30 minutes  I know  They closed the hallway  Now for I think  30 minutes  Do something  It looks so cheap  God  There was  I mean I think  They just used  Some in-house cameras  Yeah  Turn the lights on  They made a deal  With Fox  Because I haven't  Seen it anywhere else  Me neither  They run it all the time  On Fox  Is it helping you think  Not with the app 
[03:01:30]  No  Well the app is  Sort of working today  Oh good  There you go  Let's see if he wanted  To get that removed  And went to the tattoo  Removal place  How long  How long is this  Going to take  Yeah  It's my entire body  And face  Fuck  That's a commitment  Right there  He's going to gain weight  And it's going to look  So stupid  Yeah  As opposed to now  It's terrific  What an attention  Whore  You think so  That's just like 
[03:02:00]  Yeah look at me  Everywhere he goes  No one sits there  And talks to him  About anything  Like oh wow  So how long  What made you  Where did you go  For  It's just all  The same shit  You don't think  They could get off  The fact that  He looks like a lizard  And what  Talk about like  You know  Oh the new  2015 models  Of fucking Dodge  Are coming out  No  That's a 401k  Yeah no one cares  You think it gets  Excited when people  Go oh my god  Of course 
[03:02:30]  Look at you  He loves walking  In a place  Why would you do that  And being stared at  Right  And they go  You're weird  And he goes  Am I the weird one  Yeah huh  Or is it all weird  I think you're weird  What's weird anyway  Can we hear him talk  I swear I don't remember  This guy on our show  Exactly  Every time he goes  Flies protest him  Weird news  Look it's weird news  Weird news  It is  It's that weird news  Weird  I hope Scorch gets sued  For using the weird news thing  Why 
[03:03:00]  Because this person's  Using weird news  Special edition  Of 10's weird news  Weird  Weird  I'm joined in the studio  By Eric  Studio  He's known as Lizardman  He's had a whole lot  Of body modification  To look like  A lizard  And  Lizard  Hi Eric  Thanks for coming in  I'll blame an onion  He looks like an idiot  A lizard  What was it you wanted  To discuss  Well it started off  When I was about 18 years old  I went to college  And I was studying art  And philosophy  And I had already been  Working  In terms of 
[03:03:30]  Sort of student art projects  Throughout high school  With temporary modifications  Things like body painting  And costuming  And  I wanted to do  Something more permanent  It's lipstick and a dress  And I was also getting  Interested and involved  With body modification  So I decided I wanted  To use that  In terms of my artwork  Why a lizard though?  Did a dinosaur  Why a lizard  Did we do?  Just a pure aesthetic choice  I like the way that  Reptiles look  The same way you might  Pick out an outfit  For the day  You pick out something  You think looks good 
[03:04:00]  Oh yeah  It's the same shit  I thought this looked good  Okay  So talk me through  The procedures you had done  I'll give you the  Grocery list as it were  700 hours of tattooing  Covers my entire body  I wonder if these are  Questions you've been  Asked before  Oh yeah  Subdermal teflon implants  On my skull  To create the horned  Ridges over my eyes  Teeth filed down  To sharp points  Using a dentist drill  And of course  A bifurcated tongue  Split in two  Like that of a snake  Using an argon biopsy laser  Could you do that  Straight away?  When it was first done 
[03:04:30]  Immediately after the procedure  My tongues were so swollen  I couldn't really do anything  Oh no  About 48 hours of time  Where I was just  Putting ice chips on my mouth  And waiting for the pain  To go away  And the swelling to subside  But after about a week  I could talk and eat  Pretty normally  Four to six weeks  Probably more or less fully healed  Out of all of them  What's hurt the most?  Most?  The most painful thing  That I've done  In terms of body modification  Is easily my implants  I had my cock  So bad  Cut off  Shoved in my ass 
[03:05:00]  As a result of the pain  It's for art  It's for art  I know  Wait what happened  Because of the pain?  I think that  You know  Over the years  What did he say?  His implants  Was over his head?  Yeah  It was in his eyebrows  He said it's the most painful thing  But something happened  Because of the pain  He had to vomit?  Was it just vomit?  I mean he passed the mirror  The most painful thing  That I've done  In terms of body modification  Is easily my implants  So bad  That I actually hallucinated  And vomited  As a result of the pain  Oh my god  I thought it looked like an ass  Pretty strong pain  For your shows  I think that 
[03:05:30]  Over the years  I've become very good  At coping with pain  That's a green Brian Riga  If I know something  Is going to happen  I can prepare myself  And handle just about anything  But if it's a surprise  Like if I stub my toe  I cry like a little girl  That's fun  Well my family's reaction  Is going to be different  Than anybody else  Is because they have  The perspective  You know especially my mom  Yeah they're all thinking  What they did wrong  Day one till now  My mom has actually said  That it would be stranger  If I wasn't Lizardman  Because she sees the progression  What is she going to say?  But for a lot of people  That isn't fair  You know they just see me 
[03:06:00]  Wandering down the street  And they're like  What is that  And how did it happen?  What if you woke up one day  And you were just  Sick of being Lizardman  And you decided  You wanted a normal job?  I don't think I'll ever  Want a normal job  In fact a big part  Of the appeal of this  To me is that  A lot of normal jobs  Are out of reach  You know people will say  Well you never get a job  Working at a bank  Looking at it  And I'm like  Well thank you  Because I'd never want  To be stuck working  At a bank  Behind a counter  As a teller  Or something like that  But you know  There are no guarantees  You could refuse your lawyer  Or a dentist  You could regret being a reporter 
[03:06:30]  Being on TV  Anyone can regret anything  The way that we diminish  The possibility of regret  Is by careful planning  In the beginning  And I did spend over three years  Planning and considering this  That's more time  Than most people put into  Getting to know the person  They marry and have kids with  Okay so you're actually  Here in Australia  Promoting a book  Jesus  Tell me a little bit  That's a travel to the world  This is the new Ripley's annual  Download the weird  I have been working with Ripley's  For about 13 years now  Going back to one day  Somebody's got a couple pages 
[03:07:00]  In the book  Coffee table book  And if you don't have a coffee table  It turns into a coffee table  It's actually a great idea  It's just weird to you  Normal people are weird  What's it mean to you?  And finally  How much little does it cost?  Asking how much it cost to me  Is kind of like  Going to a gallery  Looking at a painting  And saying  Wow look at that masterpiece  How much did the paint  And the canvas cost?  It's not really  A relevant question  That said  About eight or nine years ago  I was doing a television program 
[03:07:30]  And they thought it would be  Interesting to get  An insurance adjuster  Sort of  It wasn't Lloyd's of London  But one of those types of groups  That insured dancers legs  And things like that  So they brought the guy out  They had him talk to me  Look at what I'd done  They said  Alright  How much would you insure  Lizardman for?  And his response was  No less than a quarter million dollars  Now you're inside  The world of Sideshare Wonderland  Where you will witness  Like the human  I don't know for this fucking guy  He's an asshole  And we had him on, huh?  Yeah  He's doing stunts  Yeah  He does all that weird stuff 
[03:08:00]  2005 he was on  Thanks, Iraq  How much did it cost you  To do the  Why did you do it?  I had a koala step on my clit  When I was younger  I know  I wish I could do a better Australian accent  Oh  Let's go home  She was  She was alright for it  Aussie  Yep  That's it I guess for today  Alright kids  Fuck it  Oh wow  You know what he did?

[03:15:30]  Wrapped  They got sent to us  So pick out something  To nosh  And then  Oh jeez  Roland just threw  It across the floor  Roland's not happy  With you today  You shouldn't throw  Food Roland  Roland was  Roland was cursing  You through the window  When you were  Walking down the hall  He is not happy  With you today  He always does  He's always doing that  No but today  Specifically  For some reason  We sort of have  Like a hate-hate  Relationship  Why  In the sense  That you hate  Hating each other  No I love Roland  He's a character  Okay so where  Does the second hate  Come from  I'm just funning  With you 
[03:16:00]  You're just funning  Just funning  I walked in  He goes  Hey  Good morning  I go  Good morning  You got pecker head  He called you  What you called Roland  A pecker head  No he called me that  No you called me that  Did I call you a pecker head  Yeah this morning  What do you mean  He called you  Dennis  I wasn't sure  Dennis  I'll call you a pecker head  Dennis nobody in this building  I don't know of anybody  On the planet  Except for my dad  Who's at this point  Of a certain age  And a bit of a traditionalist  Calls anybody a pecker head  It's a throwback  Yeah I know  It's a throwback 
[03:16:30]  But I feel like that's exclusively Falcone  If somebody is being accused  Of calling somebody else a pecker head  You can almost be guaranteed  That you're the one who said it  Or your dad  Or my dad  If my dad was walking around here  Maybe it was him  Hey pecker head how are you  Yeah you just have pecker head battles  Amongst each other  Yeah then he got a banana  And a screaming stock quotes  In the banana  So he got a banana stock quotes  Yeah like he picked up the phone  And goes yeah buy sell  Were you using the banana like a phone  Like a phone  Like an iNana 
[03:17:00]  iNana  Get it  For the holiday season  No I got it  I mean it just  That's something  I bet you he used that  On the 70's channel  iNana  Yeah  Have you ever used that joke before  There was a pen back in the 70's  Called the Bic Banana  The Bic Banana  Yeah it was like  It was a  You know  A pen  Shaped like a banana  No it was just called  The Bic Banana  Why was it called  The Bic Banana  I guess it was yellow  Did it write in yellow  No I wrote it  Red black  But they just called it  It was just a pen  That was yellow  The Bic Banana  Yeah  And they called it a banana  The Bic Banana 
[03:17:30]  Yeah  And you had fun with that  But you said  I'll turn it into a telephone  An iNana  iNana  There you go  That's horrible dude  Folks at Apple  Are going to pick up on that  And I mean  The whole idea  Of you talking into a banana  As a cell phone  Well it was just funny  Because  It's not funny though  Because Tommy was walking around  With Tommy from the Hits channel  Okay  And I called him Tommy Salami  Why  Because it's funny  It rings  Tommy Salami  Reference to his penis  No  Is that a dick thing  It's back to the pecker head thing  Is it a 
[03:18:00]  A lot of dick stuff  Coming from Denny today  Huh  No it's just funny stuff  Talking about your co-workers  Peckers  Their salamis  Roland  Totally off-base  Is he kind of bringing up  Your penis a lot today  I don't know what's going on  He may need some vajayjay  Because he's very feisty  This morning  No I'm fine  You come in  You start  Roland  And Roland  I'm going to tell you this  About Roland  It's his little  Behind the curtain magic  Behind the scenes  Yes  He had a rough day  As far as guest pitchers go  I'm not going to mention any names  Because I think he's still  Going to work on them  Yeah 
[03:18:30]  But Roland  Must have flung a half dozen names  At Opie and Anthony today  Wow  And he received a half dozen  Dicks in the asses in return  Is that right Roland  Me and A-Rod  We're seeing the bench  Him and A-Rod  Sitting on the bench  Hey he's doing his job  Yeah but  He's doing his job  Take enough shots on net  Something's going to go in Roland  Roland  I'm trying didn't you man  Roland takes it very seriously  And he takes it personally too  When his guests  That he pitches  Are not approved  And he thinks  At least some of them  Should be  He takes it personally  It's because he loves his job  If he just walked away  Saying that  I'll hell with it 
[03:19:00]  However  He knows  Where the getting's good  He knows who's paying him  Right  So he's not going to  Take his anger out  On Opie, Anthony, Jim, Norton  Never  I've been in the seat before  Where Opie, Anthony, Jim  They'll be hurling insults at him  I'll laugh  And he'll  Wing a stapler  Or something at me  Wow  Because that anger  Has to come out on somebody  I'm telling you, Dennis  Why don't you just do it  As a surprise  Like bring the guest in  Say, look  Look who I got for you today  Just hit him with that surprise  Roland, how do you think 
[03:19:30]  That would go?  Not good  Try it once  I'm afraid  That it'll be like  The quiet game  Where they all sit down  And one by one  Gets up  And then the guest  Will go like  What's going on?  Walk out  You mean like  What happened with you  And the MTV VJs?  Correctamundo  Correctamundo, indeed  Now  Yeah, but you got Sam  Who could just pick up  He left too  Yeah, on VJ day  I left Roland alone  I was like  Hey, what's up guys?  But what I  The reason I worry about you  Yes  Is because  Now you're coming in 
[03:20:00]  And whirling these  Peckerhead remarks  At Roland  Just like that  Right off the bat  And he's going to have  Somebody to unleash  All this anger on  Is that right, Roland?  Throughout the day  Yeah, but you  I mean  There's a difference  Between day-to-day  Roland busting balls  And Roland upset  Yeah, I want her, Denny  No  You don't want to  No, I like Denny  He's just a buffoon  We're office pals  Are you?  Yeah  Sure  He just called you a buffoon  That's alright  He's a friend  That's okay  It's the nicest thing  He's ever called me  Let me go to Nick  In Tennessee  What's up, Nick? 
[03:20:30]  Sure, what's up, man?  Dennis Falcone's  Banana cell phone  I like it  You think that's  Dennis Falcone's  Banana cell phone  Hey, Jim  I think you've got a mark  Hang on a second, Nick  You know how sometimes  Like you'll put a  Yeah, one of your characters  Will put a banana  To your ear  Like a telephone  And ironically do that  As if  Who would ever  Actually try to pull this off  As a joke  What are you trying to do?  Make me laugh  Before I leave?  Today  Dennis saw Roland come in  And goes  Hey, Roland  And starts yelling  Stock quotes 
[03:21:00]  Into a banana  As if it's a telephone  It was just something  You know  Spur the money  It'd be funny  He'd get it into a shotgun  That's a great stash  By the way  And I called it  The iNana  Did you notice?  I'm just working on it  Just trying to stash  Yeah, it's cool  Just trying to work on it  Dennis Falcone  If you want to get rid of that  Stash, turn a fan on  Watch it blow off  That wispy dust stash  He does  Dennis Falcone  Has walked in here  With the wispiest  Salt and pepper mustache  I've ever seen  It looks like he was  Just eating something 
[03:21:30]  With salt and pepper  Salt and pepper on it  Salt and pepper here  It's literally  It's an awful non-stash  How long have you been  Growing that thing?  Be honest  Friday  Friday  Yeah, so it's what  Three, four days now?  It's a thin  Non-resonating mustache  Were you hoping for more by now?  Yeah, sure  You were  You were  You're a little disappointed  In the growth  We'll put a little something  On it  It's a chemo stash  Yeah  Terrible  And plus it's like  White and gray  Did you notice?  Yes, I did notice  Did you know though?  Because how long ago  Has it been since you had a mustache?  Yeah  You look like fucking Harry Reams  I had it about five, six years ago 
[03:22:00]  I shaved it  Okay  So last time you grew a mustache  Was it a little darker?  Yeah  Did you know  When you grew it this time  That it would come in that white?  Sure  You did  You already knew  Yeah, but they also have  The hair club for men stuff too  Yeah, but you can't  I'll dye the mustache too  I don't care  Individually  You can actually put it on your fingers  And rub each one into your  Put a fucking marker  There's nine hairs above your lip  Well, you know  You gotta give it time  So  Sam, Liam  The town booker text  He said  Dennis on the after show  Makes me want to dye 
[03:22:30]  Dennis, the reviews are already pouring in  Liam's a good guy  Apparently  Yes  Another good friend of mine here  Don't you think it'll be a little obvious  If you walk in here  With that just for men  Died mustache all of a sudden?  I don't care  He gives his hair every day  He does  Yeah  You gotta do it  You know, you're out there  In the public eye  You gotta make sure  Why the mustache?  I wanted to try it  Why now?  Why not?  It's terrible  Why not?  I can think of one good reason  It's under your nose  It looks terrible  I'll give it a shot  It's not a good mustache  But I'll take that under advisement 
[03:23:00]  Trust me  I'll help you  Do you know  Like the whole  Stereotypical pedophile mustache thing?  It's not a pedophile  No, I'm saying  Do you know of that as a stereotype?  No  Like you don't know  Of people being like  Yeah, he's kind of got a pedo mustache going on?  No, no  That's a pedo-ish looking mustache  It is, isn't it?  Yeah  I'm gonna try to grow it  Like Groucho Marx  That kind of mustache  I like that  You can't grow a mustache  Any mustache  Except for that wispy pedo mustache  Yeah  It's very kid-toucher-ish  Yeah  Even though you're not a kid-toucher  Your mustache would indicate differently to those that don't know you 
[03:23:30]  When you think of a kid-toucher  What picture is painted in your head?  A guy with a swarmy mustache, I guess  Is that right?  Yeah, but I'm not gonna have a swarmy mustache  What's it gonna look like then?  It's gonna look good  I can have any kind of mustache  It's not coming in  I'm gonna try to go for the Robert De Niro in Godfather 2  When he was the young Don Corleone  He had that nice mustache  He did  It was a little thinner, though  Well, I'll work on it  Are you gonna trim it?  Are you gonna do, like, John Waters?  Oh, that little skinny one?  Yeah  Yeah, that's kinda nice  You should do, like, Spalding Gray  I'll give it a shot 
[03:24:00]  But I will take  Thank you very much  Because I know you guys care  And that's why you  Well, we want you to look good  We want you to look foolish  I feel like you could use some fashion advice  And the mustache is where we would start  I will give it a shot  Roland, did you laugh at the banana gag?  He can see it on his Instagram  It's hilarious  Like, do you  Are you concerned  That when you're walking around the office  Talking into the banana like it's a phone  I wasn't walking around talking  I was sitting at my desk  It was just a quick bit  But when that's your idea of a joke  And you've got the mustache  And, you know 
[03:24:30]  You've kinda got this reputation  That people will assume  That there is some sort of  Pedophile tendencies  Is that a concern?  No, that's not it  Oh, there you are  The old banana phone  It's funny  It's funny  Did you post something on Instagram?  Tommy took the picture  And Gotham Tommy  Gotham Tommy  Yeah, I just stood there in shock  It's only funny if you're killed doing it  If someone's killed doing that  That's hilarious  If you don't see the elevator shaft is open  And you walk into it  And your last thing is you're dying with a banana in your hand  Needlessly 
[03:25:00]  That's funny  You're just falling down the shaft  And then for one second  Right before you splat on the ground  You look at the banana  And realize how stupid you are  Yeah, you realize you'll never see your grandkids  Because you decided to make a banana phone call  There's something beautiful about that  He wishes everybody a Denny Christmas, too  Now  You don't say that  I just say have a great day  Have a Denny Christmas  What?  Oh my god, I forgot  He walked into the office singing that  Why would you wish somebody a mediocre Christmas?  Yeah  Just a nice time of year  Why would you wish somebody a Christmas that never quite lived up to its expectations? 
[03:25:30]  Exactly  Have yourself a Denny little Christmas  Oh no  Yeah, just sing that into the office  Every day  Have a Denny Christmas  A Denny Christmas definitely has a lot of alcohol involved  No, there was a lot of alcohol  And it's a lonely Christmas, too  You can just see a shotgun  Mumbling  Right  You know who has a Denny Christmas, I'll bet  Ian Watkins  Probably had a Denny Christmas  Fingering a one-day-old  We were just having some fun  It was just a little top of  You know  You got any lost profits on the hard drive of hits?  No  Lost profits, no  No, I do not 
[03:26:00]  Oh, I gotta add that  I do not  It's a catchy little number he's got there  No, I do not  Absolutely  You got a matching hard drive of hits?  What?  I have a backup  No, to Ian  No  No, okay  I was just asking  No, I don't  You think now, with the Ian Watkins story all over the news  Now was a good time to grow the mustache?  I don't care  No?  I'm doing what I want to do  Good  So is he  Yeah, that's exactly right  It's just like to have a mustache  That's all  Oh, it's just so  I guess it's strange  Whenever  When an older man decides to change his 
[03:26:30]  Appearance  Appearance  And his facial hairstyle  It's a big deal  No, it's not  It's a reality show  Don't they have all those makeover shows and everything?  That I  I don't know  I don't think  Denny's mustache would make a very compelling reality show  Yeah, Anthony was talking about the homes in Alaska before  I mean, that's not a  Yeah, that was another thing  That was Alaska and the Great Frontier  Right  Yeah  That was another thing that Roland didn't like  He wanted  He was hoping to pitch those men as guests on the show  No, the gold rush  Right 
[03:27:00]  And then all of a sudden they shit all over it  Yeah, we didn't  We weren't kind to the gold rush  No  I love the show  What did Kenny call it?  Gold jerk offs  Yeah  Oh, Dennis Falcone  But thank you very much for inviting me in here and sharing some holiday cookies  Is this just an excuse to try to get some free Dollar Shave Club razors or something?  No, no, it's not  Because you're all about the free shit  I just wanted to try it  I just wanted to try the mustache  How do you think it's going so far?  Are you happy with the  It's a bust  That's all right  Is it a bust?  Is it a bit of a bust?  You look better with that dumb fucking banana under your nose  Yeah, be honest 
[03:27:30]  Well, I wanted to color it in like red and green like Fez did one day  Remember he had it all colored?  So maybe for the Christmas party  The office holiday party  Fez, if you look at Fez  He's got a strong mustache  That's a guy who can grow some facial hair  That's true  Like any given week  He's somebody who can try different things  Okay  Because on a Friday he could say  I'm going to grow a mustache  And within a week's time  He'll have a thick manly mustache  Yeah  You have a very  You have kind of a thin  You have a low testosterone stache 
[03:28:00]  That's true  We have to know where our limitations are in life, Denny  Man has to know his limitations  Yours are facial hair and radio  Right  So far  You're making all the wrong choices  But I have friends like Jim  Who, you know, at least give me the advice  I love you guys  I mean, radio  Radio  You are a godsend  You are the man as far as  However  Jim's got to go  Jim's got to go  Jim wants to go  Facial hair you are not 
[03:28:30]  Has anybody complimented the mustache?  No, everybody said  Hey, grow the mustache  You should have tried the full beard  You should have done everything  Well, that's a little more in style  That's  I don't know  The full beard  The full beard  I don't know  Maybe I'll give it a shot  We, I mean  Are you better growing a full beard than a mustache?  I've never tried to grow a full beard  Have you ever  How much time is the longest that you've gone without shaving?  I give it like four or five days  Your face, not your  No, four or five days for a beard  So you've gone four or five days without shaving  Yeah  And what's the result? 
[03:29:00]  I don't like it  It doesn't come in even all the time  It doesn't  It's rough, no  Hmm  You're one of those guys  Maybe you're just not born to grow a beard  Okay  But I don't think you're born to grow a mustache  Okay  I'm pretty sure  Eric, what's the office saying about the mustache behind Denny's back?  I've got to know  Honestly, other than Roland, I don't think anyone's noticed it  Nobody cares  There's more important things to worry about than me growing a mustache  You look like a French villain  Okay, at least I'll take that  That's funny at least  It looks like it's a milk mustache  You look like you're in a got milk ad 
[03:29:30]  That's what it looks like  It looks like you drank out of an ashtray  Right  Right  It looks like you had a very dirty cup of milk  Well, I appreciate you guys coming in here and always helping to build my self-confidence  It looks like somebody came on your upper lip and then put a cigarette out on it  That's what it looks like  To me  That's just the first thing  I didn't want to say it, but that's the first thing that jumped out  Well, maybe I will have to borrow some of those free reigns  Yeah  I know, Denny  No, Denny  Don't listen to me  Don't listen to Jim  Don't listen to me 
[03:30:00]  No  You know, you follow your path in life  You know what I mean?  And maybe, what if we're wrong?  That's hard for me to believe that I could be wrong  But what if I'm wrong?  What if now is the  What if 2013, 2014  Yeah  Because it'll be 2014 before anything resembling a mustache is on that lip  What if 2014 is the year of the Denny mustache?  Have yourself a Denny New Year, I guess  I have to give it a shot  That doesn't even sound right  Denny New Year  I might as well say have a Sam New Year  Have a Sex Bagel New Year 
[03:30:30]  Okay  Fine  We should get a black Sharpie and give him a Groucho Marx mustache  Yeah?  Would you let us color it in with Sharpie?  No, I'd prefer not to  Because Sharpie, you can't get that off  How about if we dip our fists in men's hair club?  Yeah  What's it called?  Just for men  Just for men  Or, you said you wanted maybe like a red mustache for Christmas  What if we just pummel you about the face until it just soaks in?  My face is all blotchy  Yeah, something like that  Well, thank you  Again, I'm going to take these fashion tips under advisement 
[03:31:00]  It's just something to try  I appreciate your time  Is this a New Year's thing?  Like you're like, you know what, I've got to make a change?  Is this one of those things where you're thinking  I've got to make a change in my life?  This is where I'm going to start?  No  It's not?  No, I'm fine  Because I've done that before  Where I'll go  I've got to make  And then I'll like  Won't shave for a week  And then eventually I'll get tired of it  But the initial thing is  It's time to make a change  You know, I've got to stop putting up with this stuff  I've got to do things differently  And maybe a beard is going to help 
[03:31:30]  Maybe for you  No, I just didn't give it that much thought  I just said, you know what?  I'm going to try to grow a mustache  You don't think so, Jim?  Golly  You think he's lying about that?  No, I think he opened a spam email  Which wasn't even intended for him  It was just one of those weird ones  That just said, are you a flop?  He's ready to turn the corner, huh?  I just came down to ask E-Rock  If he got some of the music I gave him  And I come in here and get berated  No, we're not berating you  No, of course not  We're not berating you  It's all fun  E-Rock, did you get his music?  Yeah, I haven't gone through all of it yet 
[03:32:00]  Alright  Okay  I just want to make sure you got it  You don't think you're a flop, do you?  Of course not  Me either  No  I think Jim's way off on that  Jim's the best  However  About Denny being a flop  I didn't say he was a flop  Oh, the email  I said he opened a spam email  Which was not even intended for him  Right  And it said, are you a flop?  And he just  I think he stared at it  For a long time  Right  It was one of those weird life moments  Well, it's when you think  Like Dr. Steve called in this morning  Yes  And he said  He heard a crack  But there were no bones broken 
[03:32:30]  And to him that was God saying  It's time to get out of  Of birthing children  Right  Maybe for Denny  Looking at that email  Even though it wasn't necessarily  Intended for him  Was God's way of saying  You're a flop  There was no email  There wasn't  Jim was wrong  A flop  Oh  Yes  Have you ever  Do you have moments of self-doubt?  No, of course not  You gotta be confident  Is that true?  Yes  You never have a moment of self-doubt  If I'm playing a song at a party  I'm not talking  I'm talking about  No  Gee, I should've played that one  Listen  I'm talking about when you're sitting at home 
[03:33:00]  And you're assessing your life  You don't spend time assessing yourself  Yeah  I do  Of course you do  Everybody does  And you don't have self-doubt  No  Why should I have self-doubt?  You should assess your life  In the bathroom  And you might want to get  An inspiration  There's a movie called  Full Metal Jacket  That's a great way  This is my rifle  No, I'm not going to do that  No  Never a moment of self-doubt  I wish I could  I wish I could have that kind of  Blind self-confidence  It's not blind self-confidence  You gotta be confident  I know  But you have to be  You don't think it's somewhat  Blind self-confidence?  We all make mistakes  But no  There's nothing worse than somebody  Who just does not see themselves 
[03:33:30]  In a little season  Right  A true ass  He's wearing a mad bomber hat  As he says that to me  But he knows he's an ass  Like if anyone  If anybody sits there  Self-doubting  Alone in his apartment  Doing weird character voices  Yeah  It's Jim  I self-doubt  When I'm accepting awards  Yeah  I've never accepted an award  I was trying to be funny  But not you, Denny  No, no  No  Denny has sociopathic confidence  It's so weird  Yeah  Because I more relate to Jim's thing  Of like even when somebody  Is rewarding you  You just waiting 
[03:34:00]  For somebody to come in  And tell everybody  It's a mistake  He's not supposed to be rewarded here  No  You know  You get the emails  The positive quote of the day  You read those  And you get reinforcement in there  I'll email you some of them  Why don't you just tell us one  Yeah  Like what type of positive quote  What's that  You know  It's like  What was the one  That came across yesterday  That you should  Never doubt yourself  Always believe  Because if you believe  Strong enough  It can come true  You think that's true?  Sure  Because this is the season  To believe 
[03:34:30]  But what  Is it based on  That's true  I don't know  It's just some guy  Said it and wrote it down  I don't know  Vince Lombardi said it  But you're sitting there  Going yeah  I think that's right  Yeah  But don't your own  Life experiences  Tell you that things  Sometimes work out  Differently than you planned  Denny  Normally  Sure things work out  Differently  Literally always  Sure  Yes  But are you just waiting?  You're just like  Well no  I'm going to keep believing  And eventually things  Won't work out differently  You've got to believe  You've got to believe  In yourself  And you've got to believe  In your strengths 
[03:35:00]  Maybe we should all  Be more like you  Maybe we shouldn't  Be trying to shake you here  I don't need to be shaken  You're not going to be shaken  Or stirred  You're unshakeable  You did a little  James Bond joke  Very good  You like that?  Yeah  You're a Bond guy?  I'm a Bond guy  What's your favorite Bond?  Which actor?  Sean Connery  Of course  He's the best  You didn't like Roger Moore?  No  He was cheeky jokes  He's a little too  Characterish  Guy's hanging  Oh it looks like  He's hung up  I thought the actor  Who played  Running from Steel  The actor who played  Tom Selleck  No one of Tom Selleck 
[03:35:30]  Who played  Remington Steel  I don't know  I thought Tom Selleck too  The other James Bond  Daniel Craig  George Lazenby  No George Lazenby  He was only there for one I think  Right?  Her Majesty's Secret Service  What's his name?  From Mrs. Doubtfire  Yes  That's who you're thinking of?  Pierce Brosnan  I thought he did a very good job  You liked him  I thought he did a good job  You think Roger  That's like a good example  You think Roger Moore  Sits at home realizing  He was the shits  As far as James Bond goes  I don't think he cares  He probably still gets  The nice checks  And that's it for him  He's happy  What about the integrity? 
[03:36:00]  He did the best job  That he could have  At the time  But if it's not good  It's like fuck  Then I'm not a good person  It's very tough  To follow Sean Connery  It is tough to follow  Sean Connery  Take care  Thanks  See you later Jim  I'm gonna write some notes down  About what you told me today  You are  I am  You take every little advice  To heart  See what works for you  Right after I shave this mustache  And when is that gonna happen?  Maybe tomorrow  You never know  You really think so?  I'll give it till Friday  Give it till Friday at least  The week  I'll give it to week  What about handlebars?  It's like Rolly Fingers  The relief pitcher  No I'm thinking about 
[03:36:30]  Coming down  Almost like the Hulkster  No that's not  You don't think so?  No  It's just  It's such a weird choice  Because that's not the mustache  There are facial hairstyles  That are in style right now  Right  The pedophile mustache  Is not in style  It's not gonna be  A pedophile mustache  It's not my intention  That's what the style  Is called though  Eric  You're good with facial hairstyles  What's the style called  That he has?  Pedophile mustache?  Yeah  Yeah that's correct  Or dirty European  I like French villain  Eric's changed his opinion  He's gone from French villain 
[03:37:00]  To dirty European  He was easily suede  I think by you gentlemen  You don't have the answers  You don't have all the answers  You know what that is?  What's that?  Easily suede  That's what Kanye said to him  Pretty clever huh?  Pretty clever  Wow  Nick in Chicago  Hey what's going on Sam?  What's up buddy?  Hey um  I was browsing around  YouTube last night  And I found  That Katie Sunshine girl  The hula hoop girl  She has a video  That's dedicated  To O&A  And is actually wearing 
[03:37:30]  Like this cut off  Opie and Anthony  Tank top  While she's hula hooping  I think we've seen it  Yeah we did that  We did it  Okay  Nick you gotta listen  To every minute of the show  At all times  Don't make him feel bad  Thank you Nick  We appreciate that  Nick  I need you to do me a favor  From now on  Five days a week  Five hours a day  I need you here buddy  Okay  Alright  Time for Sam  I'm on  Alright  Thank you Nick  See Denny  That's how you inspire loyalty  None of this  Hey thanks  Maybe you got us next time  It's let them know  We need people  Put them in their place  That are listening to this channel 
[03:38:00]  Five days a week  Five hours a day  You know what specific hours  I'm talking about  6am  To 11am  That's right  Eastern Standard Time  Eastern Standard Time  And if you can't do that  3pm to 8pm  Eastern Standard Time  That's the replay  The replay  Yeah  Replay  I mean you gotta  You gotta  It's TSL  It's important  Yes it is  And if you can't  Be compelling enough  To do it  At least you can demand  That people do it  I demand  That you listen  Maybe you think about  Doing that on the 60's channel  Demand 
[03:38:30]  Like instead of saying  Don't turn that dial  Don't touch that dial  Say you touch that dial  I'll kill your fucking family  No no  We try to  Here's the Beach Boys  We try to spread it around  You think so  Oh sure  Why  Well because you should  Because if you're playing  The Amboy Dukes  Which features Ted Nugent  What's the Amboy Dukes  Let me get to the point  Okay sorry  Ted Nugent was in the group  You might say  Hey if you want to hear  Some great 70's rock and roll  From Ted Nugent  Check out  Sirius XM  70's on 7  Or Classic  Yeah but why wouldn't you  Want him to stay with Denny  Well you would  But we try to spread it around  To show you the benefits  Of the platform 
[03:39:00]  We've been through this before Sam  I guess I just don't understand  Well I just got to  Bang this into your head  Maybe I'm too competitive  Yes you are  You're a very competitive person  Yeah  Like I don't want anybody  Listening to any other channels  Unless like  You could listen to Hits 1  On the overnights  If I'm on it  Yes  But sometimes I'm not on it  Well  Your radio's not really on  If Sam is not on your radio  That's very good  Can I use that  That hasn't been used before  Has it  No  Okay you thought of that just now  Yeah no no  I stole it from somebody else  No no no  There's no original things  We just reinvent them  What 
[03:39:30]  Rework them  Jody in Canada  How's it going there  Prime time  Good buddy  Good good  Hey I was just  I listened to you guys  Lots and whatnot  I was just wondering  I know you guys  Give away a lot of free shit  I know you guys  Don't give away a lot of free shit  To a lot of Canadians  And since it's Christmas time  I was hoping  That I could be the first one  What do you think  We should do here Denny  I don't think we're allowed  To mail across the border  Is that right  No but it sounded  It sounded official  What  Do you think  Jody calls in a lot  He's a regular  You know how I know  Jody calls in a lot  Because Opie and Anthony  Always think he's a girl 
[03:40:00]  Oh  Because I named Jody  That's exactly it  I'm the same guy  Yeah  Now  Is your full name Jody  My name is Jody Blair Jacobs  Blair is your middle name  Blair is my middle name  What the fuck  Did your parents do  Are they just trying  To make like a  Bare knuckle fighter  If I guess  Well they must have  I'm fucking  6'3 250 pounds  Good  Good  You fucking made  That Jody shit  Work for you  Didn't you  Like a boy named Sue  That's exactly right  Fucking right  That's  Alright well then  I'll send you  How about I send you 
[03:40:30]  A copy of like  The Hangover 3  On Blu-ray  Fuck I would love that  Sam  I fucking love it  Alright stay on hold  Thank you  See that Denny  Wow that was great  Inspiring loyalty  Very good  Every now and then  A little gift is gonna  Come somebody's way  You made somebody  Very happy right there  But then you know  What's gonna happen  Denny's gonna want one  Then  No no  You wanna copy of The Hangover  You know why Denny  Can't have one  He doesn't have  Blu-ray player at home  Oh  Is that right Denny  No  Why don't you shave your mustache  And get yourself a Blu-ray player  I'm gonna upgrade  From the Betamax machine  I wanna do a new show 
[03:41:00]  Here on Sirius XM  Called Improving Denny's Life  There's so many things  I could do to you  Wow  To improve your life  Don't you think  I could do that  I guess so  I inspire people  I make people better  Okay  One step at a time  Very good  Well you pick your shirt up  Before it looks weird  Denny gets excited  And he picked his shirt up  And he just started  Pelvic thrusting  Into the console  Fixing my jeans here  That's all  You ever wanna fuck  This console Denny  I know you love radio  No I don't do that  You wanna make love to it  No I don't  He was doing it last time  Remember when he was  In here with Nicole  Yeah but that was weird 
[03:41:30]  Well I just have  Nervous energy  Just standing around  I just can't stand  You think Denny  Wants to make love  To this console Eric  He was hitting the point  That separates you  And the guest  Right there on the console  Last time I was here  He just kept hitting  Right into the point  Just rubbing his shaft on it  Yeah  You think that's what he's doing  Right  Yeah  When you were doing that  Just now Denny  No  You were making physical contact  With the console  True or false  False  I was just standing here  Going like this  Just rocking back and forth  Just pelvic thrusting  If Ron and Fez  Weren't on after us  And we turned all the lights off  He'd be in here  Laying down on the console 
[03:42:00]  Do you think he'd be  Would he be thrusting  Humping  That I don't know  But he might be rolling around  I think he'd be dry humping  What'd you think of the show today  The Open Anthony show  Oh as always  I thought it was very educational today  Not too many guests though today  With zero guests today  That's what I thought  You're the first guest of the day  Wow that's sad  Really sad  Especially for me  But  It was a very educational show today  You have any good guests  Coming up this week  Yeah yeah yeah  Brandon Steiner's in tomorrow  Wow  He's uh  I guess he's gonna give away shit  I don't know  Signed stuff 
[03:42:30]  Yeah signed  Signed stuff  You're right Danny  Signed goodies  More stuff  Brandon Steiner's gonna be in tomorrow  But  Wow  Today  Here's what we learned about  Yes  We learned about  How trains are conducted  Yes  We learned about  How babies are born  How some babies  Can't get their shoulders  Out of the vagina  We learned about  Gold mining  We learned about  Honey buckets  You know what a honey bucket is Danny  I heard you guys talking about that  And I was doing some  Christmas music stuff  You want me to tell you what it is  Please  It's when you have an outhouse  Yes  But you gotta take a 
[03:43:00]  Massive shit  In the middle of the night  You don't wanna go outside do you  It's the middle of the night  Especially in Alaska  Yeah  So you take a shit in a bucket  And that bucket  And that bucket's got a rope on it  Brings it right down to the outhouse  Isn't that great  No I'd run out to the outhouse  Believe me  Okay well that's  I mean that's something we learned  That's something we got into today  And of course  Zoos and  What was his name  Otabanga  You hear about Otabanga  No  He's a black guy  That they used to put in the zoo  Okay  And display him 
[03:43:30]  Like look at this dude  Like the wild man of Borneo  Kind of like that  Like on the little rascals  Crazy  Crazy  Wow  But I can't believe  This Metro North crash  Yeah  That they've been talking about  I tweeted something out  And it was facetiously last night  But after all this time  You go to  You go to Disney World right  Yes  You ever been to Disney World  Yeah  I love Disney World  It's great isn't it  I love Disney World  What's your favorite part about it  Just the tram ride going in  It's the anticipation  You like that  It's like wow  You're going in there  Yeah  I used to like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea  I don't think they have that anymore 
[03:44:00]  They don't  No  I believe they got rid of that  Before 1991  I like the Country Bears  You do  That's good too  It's a small world after all  That's always good too  No it's not  That's fun  No it's not  It's a small world after all  Eric as a dog  Like I go there with my wife  She doesn't want to see  Small world after all  Well your wife  But you know what  You asked Travis  He has a little girl  And I have a daughter  And we must have gone through  That thing like 10 times  That doesn't mean you should think  It's great  I think it's great too  Because I remember it from  The World's Fair  Back in the 1960s  I didn't even know  There was a 1960s 
[03:44:30]  Yes there was  It's a small world after all  Those two rides that he likes  Are the ones that people go to  Because they walked around  The entire park  And they were so hot  They just wanted to sit in  Air conditioning for a while  It's like when it rains  And you gotta go indoors somewhere  I guess we'll do  Pirates of the Caribbean again  I like the Space Mountain  Okay that's a fun one  That's a ride  Space Mountain is great  That's a fun one  But you look at  Big Thunder Mountain Railroad  Right  They fucking run those trains  All day long  Sure  No conductors  Right  All on this automated track  Why the fuck can't Metro North 
[03:45:00]  Figure out  How to just let the trains  Run by computers  They don't even  Do you guys have  On Metro North trains  Do you have  A Wi-Fi service  No  No they don't even have  They don't even have  No  No Wi-Fi  A buddy of mine  Came up from North Carolina  To look for a job  And he gets on the train  Out on Long Island  And he asked the conductor  He said excuse me  Do you have Wi-Fi  And the conductor says  You're lucky you get lights  But I don't understand  Why in 2013  It's on a track  Right  There's no  What are you steering 
[03:45:30]  The guy was  Excessive speeds though  So program it  Well exactly  Well the news said  They're not going to have  That system in until 2015  Why would it take until 2015  You could have had it in in 95  Because of budgets  And all this other shit  They had to wait  To get it all done  Stump Brain on Twitter  Last night told me  It was because of unions  Yeah  Yeah I was going to mention that too  You think so  The unions  They don't want to get  The jobs taken away  Like here's my thing  We've talked about  The robots before  I think  Putting the robots in  For cashiers  And for ticket booths  And like parking lots 
[03:46:00]  I think that's bad  Right  I think you need  Like menial jobs like that  And it doesn't  That doesn't  Customer service  Not menial  Customer service  And you know what I'm saying  Yeah  But to replace those people  With robots  Is a bad thing  You need those jobs  For people  Right  Right  Yes  But it doesn't affect  Anybody's safety  If you can go and say  Well we can get a computer  To get this right  All the time  It's totally unnecessary  To have anybody  Actually manually  Controlling this thing  You've got to just do it  I mean and this was 
[03:46:30]  A very isolated incident  I mean I know  Metro North has had  A couple of accidents  This year  But not to that magnitude  Not to that magnitude  But it's like  It should never  It should never  Happen  Like  I don't even understand  The concept of speed limits  In a train  It should be like  The train just goes  This speed always  And stays on the track  It's a track  Right  But he was  If you time it  There's no way  You're going to crash  Into each other  Maybe he was running behind  So he was speeding  Sometimes you speed  Maybe you're  You know  You've got to get to the show  You've got to get here on time  So you speed 
[03:47:00]  But that's why  You shouldn't even have  The ability to speed  Right  Right  Exactly  What you're saying  Right  They should work on the system  Work on it  They should  Eliminate the system  Put in  Whatever they got  On Big Thunder Mountain Railroad  That system  Right  Put it  Because Big Thunder Mountain Railroad  It takes these sharp turns  Yeah  Fucking 60 miles an hour  Yeah  I don't think it's that fast  On the  It's a small world  No  It's a small world  It's a boat  Okay  I like that boat  I could swim faster  Than small world  I like the country bears too  And I have  You know what  When I ride small world 
[03:47:30]  I jump out of the boat  And I swim out  I'm trying to get out of there  This thing sucks  Wow  That was like the  One time I drank the water  In small world  And I started freaking out  I proclaimed myself  The lizard queen  And just went around  The whole park  Like seeing shit  It was crazy  It was crazy  You were like Eddie Murphy  What was that  Beverly Hills Cop 2 or 3 or something  When he was in the amusement park  I don't know anything about that  Were you saying you could see the music  That's what I said dude  Were you there  Might have been  Let me go to  Actually let me go to  Nervous Jared 
[03:48:00]  Nervous Jared  Hey  How you guys doing  You don't sound nervous at all  You sound confident  You sound robust  Oh  Thank you  That was  That was a moniker  Given to me by  The boys  You sound a little more nervous now  But go on  Go on  It's fine  You guys are talking about  You know  All these safety hazards  And stuff  Have you heard about  Action Park  In Vernon  Yeah  Yeah  It's probably before Sam's time  I mean I've heard of the park 
[03:48:30]  Everybody who went there  Everybody who went there  Came home hurt  All of them  Yeah  That's like Ride Playland now  It was part of the experience  I mean I'm just  I'm 19  So I've only read  And you know  Stuff like that about it  But like  It was so bad  People were calling it  Class Action Park  And Traction Park  But they just kept it open huh  Yeah  He's right  Everybody who went there  Hey what'd you do yesterday  Your arm is in a sleigh  Went to Action Park  Yeah  But they wouldn't close it  No  No  I guess finally they did  I wonder why 
[03:49:00]  Why would they close  Class Action Park  Thanks Jared  It was brought out by another company  And if I remember  They kept some of the old rides open  But up the safety slightly  For sort of the nostalgic  The nostalgic crowd  That were coming in  And I think there might have been  Another death or something afterwards  And then they axed it  Rye Playland is like that  Thanks Jared  Have you ever been to Rye Playland  Denny?  Yeah  Years ago  Yeah  I used to do oldie shows  When I worked at one of the radio stations  They filmed the movie Big there  Yeah  They filmed a Mariah Carey music video there 
[03:49:30]  Yeah  But like people  Many people have died there  Because the rides are all old  Yeah  And they got the Dragon Coaster  And the whole reason to ride on it  Is because  It's not the thrills of going up and down  It's the thrill of  When is this thing going to finally collapse  It's made of wood  Uh huh  You know what I mean  And it's all rotting away  And everything's creaky  And that's what the thrill is  Like I could honestly die doing this  No that's  That's why I kind of stay with  It's a small world after all  Yeah you don't  You're not the risk guy  Nobody's ever gotten hurt on that ride 
[03:50:00]  Right  You're  You like to measure risk versus reward  Is that right  Exactly  You try to scoop up the money  As you go around  No you can't do that  Keep your hands inside the boat please  Hey  I mean if nobody's going to take these pennies  Are these for anybody  Yeah  Look a quarter  Bill on Long Island  Hey how you guys doing today  Good  I don't know if anyone's mentioned it yet  But  A little known fact  That hasn't surfaced too much  Is that the NTA  Has gotten the  Government  To three or four times  Put back a deadline  That they have to install 
[03:50:30]  These safety systems  That will stop speeding trains  On their own  Without any human interaction  So the law has been in place  For a while  But the NTA  Keeps getting extensions  By pushing it back  The whole point of trains  Is that they're supposed to be  Safer than human error  Well when human money  Trumps human error  Yeah  Deadline extensions  And people die  Ugh  Thanks Bill  It's nuts  There should be something  I mean they should all be  Mechanical at this point  These big giant things  Why not 
[03:51:00]  I'm sure this stuff  Will be revisited  And sadly it takes  A tragedy  It takes a tragedy  Ben in Arizona  Hey fam  You want robots  To run the train  That's right  What about robot  That runs the Star Tours ship  That didn't turn out too well  What Star Tours ship  At Disneyland  Or Disney World  No I don't know  What you're talking about  Star Tours  Yes you do  Come on  The little robot  That runs the Star Tours  Spaceship  In the ride  E-Rock help me out  You know what I'm talking about  And my ride was 
[03:51:30]  C-3PO  Oh okay  Oh he's  Star Tours  Went crazy  Oh okay  I know what you're saying  Alright Ben  That's what I'm saying  So the robots don't always help  You're right  Men  Men  Human beings  Could be women too  Quite frankly Dennis  Right  Human beings  Can man computers  That control the trains  But there's no reason  To be even thinking about  What speed they're going  Well look  Computers you know  How many times  Do things go wrong here  With computers  Every single fucking day 
[03:52:00]  But they don't have  Good computers here  Well we have good computers  Really  We can't stay on the internet  We try to stay online  Yeah but what  Art Bell quit  Because he couldn't  Stay on the internet  Poor Art Bell  We have a good IT department  All Art Bell wanted to do  Was have people  Listen to him on the internet  And now  Nobody's listening to him  Well I think if you  Just email our CEO  And you know  Say we're having problems  With the internet  He gets right back to you  He does he  He emails right back  Every time we have  Like a little office gathering  I always thank him  Art Bell is a quitter 
[03:52:30]  Isn't he  Yeah  He's a piece of  Art Bell's a piece of garbage  Way to go Danny  Send our listeners  To the CEO of the company  Well nobody's gonna  Anybody could do that  It's not a hidden secret  Nobody's gonna actually  Tell him Dennis Falcone  That's okay  Nobody  I'm sure the guy would say  That's okay  Because he's a nice guy  This is all stupid  Nobody's gonna actually  Email him  Because that's ridiculous  You don't think so  You don't think  Somebody's gonna email  The CEO of a company  Dennis I'm doing you  A service here  Okay  I'm doing you  A service  You see what I did 
[03:53:00]  I knew what you were doing  I was nice  I know what you're doing  But you don't  You don't think  A regular consumer  Emails the  Lady of a company  Lady truck  Lady trucker  Get me out of this  There are trains  Switching here  That are run by  Remote controlled trains  Poor Dennis  He don't know  What he's doing  Does he lady trucker  No  He's just  Babbling  You know  Make noise  On the radio  Sam in Oklahoma City  Hey Sam  You know you're talking  How you drank the water 
[03:53:30]  And you went crazy  Yeah  I went to a theme park once  And they had this  Robot parade  So some  Flash photography  Picture of them  The next thing  Robots are going bonkers  The robots went crazy  Just based on the  Flash photography  Yeah  Next thing I know  My family asked  To break in  And see all the cameras  And kill all the robots  By using cameras  Was Will Smith there?  Did that  No Will Smith  That's ridiculous Dennis  Will Smith wasn't there  Was he?  I think I was parked  In the itchy lot  Oh okay  Alright 
[03:54:00]  That's crazy man  The thing about  These amusement parks  Is you have to  Read the signs  There's a reason  No flash photography  Is allowed  Gary in Virginia  Hey Sam  Yeah I work  In the rail industry  And we are developing  One of the two products  That are going to be  Out there for  Dry realist trains  And you know  One of the things  That's being mandated  Is it's called  Positive train control  And that kind of  Spurred from the  Accident out  In California  That killed  Some 40 something  People or whatever  But basically 
[03:54:30]  It's building  An infrastructure  And old technology  That has all these  Sensors  And just all this  Technology  That's on the  They call it  Wayside  But basically  It's coming  You know  But then right now  The implementation  Of it  It's just  You know  Testing  We're currently  Testing right now  That's the problem  With all these  Fucking like  So many of these  Companies  Like if Google  Was in charge  Of the trains  Every train  The trains would be  Flying  They'd be completely  Driverless  But for whatever  Reason  Companies like  I guess the MTA  And a lot of  A lot of these 
[03:55:00]  Companies  They have to  Either wait until  Something's wrong  Before they fix it  Right  And when they do  Fix it  Find the cheapest  Way possible  Or like Gary  Saying  Build on old  Infrastructure  Or whatever  They can't say  Look  There's a new  Technology here  Let's build  We can just do this  Let's build it  From scratch  Spend good money  Once  You don't have to  Spend bad money  Twice  That's what I'm  Saying Dennis  Let's fix it now  Why can't there  Be more people  Like you and me  Running this thing  And Gary  Right Gary  Hey yeah  You got it  Sam buddy 
[03:55:30]  Hey one other  Thing though  With it is  That one of  The biggest  Problems is  That we run  Our passenger  Service on  Freight rails  I mean that's  That's the  Moneymaker of the  Country  Our country's  Not set up  For passenger  Service as  Well as it  Could be  As you know  Say Europe  And all that  So you know  Running at  Same speed  I mean our  Rail infrastructure  Is based on  Freight service  Not passenger  So you know  There's all  Kinds of other  Things that  You know  Go into that  Hole  Alright  Thanks Gary  Yeah I mean  It's crazy  Like you just  Wait until  Something's
