<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Sam and E-Rock hosting a “worst of 2011 so far” segment. This included clips of a physical fitness challenge involving Opie, Sam Roberts, and Bobo (with Bobo’s poor performance providing comedic moments),  a disastrous attempt by Jim Norton to get a photo signed by Jennifer Lopez (involving Steve Leeds, the show's booking department head, and further complicated by the photo being folded and placed in an envelope), and a compilation of Bobo's various attempts to appear on the show.  The segment also featured a new comedian character, Billy the Bassman, created on the air with significant influence from Larry the Cable Guy (Dan Whitney), who was a guest in studio.  Extensive riffing on the character ensued, along with off-color humor.  The "worst of" segment also included the infamous Paris Hilton interview (which would be discussed extensively later in the show).  Jimmy Fallon made a brief appearance during this section, discussing driving a NASCAR stock car at Pocono Raceway, leading to a discussion on pizza and social media.


The show then played the recorded interview with Paris Hilton, promoting her reality show.  The interview was characterized by Hilton's guarded and defensive responses, her constant promotion of her show, and her unwillingness to engage in deeper conversations about her personal life, past experiences, or relationships with other celebrities. The hosts, visibly frustrated, discussed their perceptions of her behavior as spoiled and difficult, debating whether they had been too lenient during the interview. Sam Roberts offered his perspective in the studio, agreeing that Hilton's attitude set a negative tone.  The hosts expressed their frustration with Hilton, using offensive language to describe their disappointment. They debated whether a more confrontational approach would have been better, ultimately concluding that they held back to avoid jeopardizing future opportunities.


Following the Paris Hilton discussion, the show turned to Bobo, focusing on his numerous attempts to secure a spot on the air, including numerous calls to the talent booker.  A lengthy and rambling phone call with Bobo ensued. Bobo performed several of his eccentric characters, including "Daniel Curlin, the gay abused car salesman," and "Mullet Man's Mom," even providing a one-man band performance using pots and pans and a kazoo.  The hosts interjected with commentary and encouragement throughout, with Bobo's mother briefly joining the call to express her displeasure at his late-night antics.  The segment also included a story from a caller who repeatedly and falsely claimed to be an FBI profiler, narrating fabricated and increasingly absurd experiences.  Jay Moore, a guest in studio, and the hosts reacted with disbelief and amusement.

The show later returned to a discussion of the Jennifer Lopez autograph bet. This involved further humorous commentary on Steve Leeds's attempts to secure Lopez's signature.  Patrice O’Neal and Roland (a recurring character) made in-studio appearances, adding to the comedic narrative with anecdotes about their own experiences obtaining celebrity autographs.  Ultimately, Jennifer Lopez did sign the photo, although in a way that largely obscured the image.  Jimmy Fallon made a second, more extensive appearance, recounting his experiences performing a song with Paul McCartney, including altering the lyrics of "Yesterday" to include scrambled eggs and waffle fries and subsequently performing "Here Today." He also discussed a previous SNL skit impersonating the Bee Gees and his "Thank You Notes" book.  The hosts and Fallon brainstormed future collaborations, including a possible week-long return to the show and a new skit involving a dollar bill. Fallon also described a bizarre sketch with Tracy Morgan called "Pop My Balloon."  The segment concluded with an extended playful riff on Fallon's song, "Good Boy Phone and a Naughty Boy Phone."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  From the junk shot seen around the world.  Breitbart was on the satellite radio show Opie and Anthony this morning  and passed around a cell phone image of the explicit shot.  This is the actual picture. There it is.  That's Representative Wiener's Wiener.  He tweeted to the world.  To an idiot who can't find his way around the block.  Bobo is nowhere to be shot.  He got lost going around a building.  He got lost going around a square building.  These are the must-hear moments of the past six months.  Good times. This is insane.  He gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  One of the funniest I've ever heard.  It's so brilliant. 
[00:00:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show presents the worst of 2011.  One of my great moments.  So far.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2011.  So far.  Hosted by Sam and E-Rock.  I am E-Rock.  And this is Sam.  And he's going to tell you what nonsense we're going to be playing on this show.  You know it.  Some of the best stuff that's happened this year so far.  You might not even remember it.  You might not realize it happened this year.  We're talking about the physical fitness challenge.  We're talking about Jennifer Lopez and the hunt to get her photos signed. 
[00:01:00]  Bobo and Rich Voss are a part of this, E-Rock.  Paris Hilton, the infamous interview.  And of course, Jimmy Fallon stopped by.  But E-Rock, what are we going to begin with?  Sam, it's the debut of a soon-to-be legendary comedian, Billy the Bassman.  I mean, he's a legend in the making for sure.  Billy the Bassman.  He's on his way to becoming a household name.  We had him first.  And this is it, the very first radio appearance of Billy the Bassman.  We won't be at these worst of 2011 so far.  That's all you have to do at a rally is come up with a catchphrase. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, and keep repeating it.  I have a dream.  Right.  That worked.  And I'm just over Johnny.  Get her done.  Get her done.  Yeah, we got get her done.  He's not a fan of the get her done.  No.  He finally admitted that.  But the accent, the accent's fucking hilarious.  The red dye accent.  Well, let me tell you, I was out there by the trailer the other day, and a couple of  friends of mine said, you get her done.  Why?  Come on, dude.  What are you saying?  I don't like that.  He makes a lot of money with that guy. 
[00:02:00]  I know.  He's a great guy.  We love when he's on our show.  I like Larry when he's on our show when the mics are off, and we're talking, and he's  just going, and he's going like this.  Yeah, well, let me tell you how this whole thing started.  I was doing radio, and then it's like, all right, we're back on.  Hey, how you boys doing?  Let me tell you what it's like.  I'll go there down south, and that's where my people are.  It's like, you're people?  What?  Weren't you just talking to me about fucking stocks and bonds and fucking how you're investing  in Verizon and shit?  Why are you pulling back the curtain like that? 
[00:02:30]  What are you doing?  We'll be right back after this break.  You get her done.  All right, we're off the air?  Yeah, my portfolio is taking such a beating during these hard economic times.  And the housing industry, I got four houses I'm trying to sell, and I can't.  Hey, how you doing, everybody?  We're back.  Larry the Cable Guy.  So I was in my trailer.  I was in my trailer, and a buddy of mine came over.  We're just sitting around burping and drinking bears, drinking some whiskey, some moonshine. 
[00:03:00]  And then another buddy came up in the pickup truck, and we went to go fix it.  And I'm like, yeah, you get her done, get her done.  Thank you, Larry.  We'll be right back with Larry the Cable Guy after these messages.  The payments I'm making on my Escalade are, I got a really good deal.  You did, Larry?  Yeah, yeah, I went to a great place.  Guy, you know, knows my act and everything.  And really hooked me up with all the luxuries.  Larry, excuse me, they didn't have your caramel macchiato, so I just got your regular coffee.  Is that okay?  No, it's not. 
[00:03:30]  I need a caramel macchiato.  But I don't drink regular.  How we doing, everybody?  We're back.  Get her done, get her done.  You know, I like to just have a nice cup of joe.  Anything.  Just grab the pot.  None of that fancy stuff, right?  I put it on my hot plate in my trailer, and I'm drinking.  You don't go to Starbucks for your coffee, Larry?  No, I get a Starbucks.  What the hell is Starbucks?  I get her done at home by myself.  I put the coffee grounds in the water.  I boil it up.  Get her done, get her done.  You shoot bucks, right?  You don't go to Starbucks. 
[00:04:00]  Get her done.  Get her done.  What are you doing, man?  Well, you know what?  Dude, come on.  I'm sorry.  It's every time the mics are off, he's a fantastic guy.  I don't like the act.  That's not going to be good for his image.  Come on.  Who doesn't know that he's not Larry the Cable Guy?  You got a lot of people.  Oh, really?  Yeah, a lot of fucking people.  The entire Midwest.  Yeah.  Well, for those people, I'm sorry.  There's no Santa either.  Think about the accent you're doing. 
[00:04:30]  Do you think they know he's fucking...  Who?  Yeah, yeah.  Who?  The redneck accent.  No.  Who are you talking about?  His fans.  Who are we talking about?  Larry the Cable Guy.  Later Dan.  You mean Dan?  Dan.  Yeah.  Come on, Dan.  I like fucking Opie.  I like talking to Dan.  I don't like that Opie forced me into his joke.  It's not a joke.  That's his real name.  No, that's his name.  I was like, what?  I love Dan.  I get nervous.  What?  Who?  Who the fuck?  His name's Dan.  Dan.  He's just a guy.  Dan, I don't know.  I like to listen. 
[00:05:00]  Dan?  I was listening to some Merle Haggard the other night, and me and the boys were just listening  to Merle Haggard, hanging out in my man cave.  I got there.  I got some tools and some wood, and we got her done.  We got her done.  And I was...  You got a pickup truck in the front yard on blocks?  Oh, well, I did jump on blocks, but we plan on putting the wheels back on and get her  done.  And we're going to go out there and drive around and just go to one of the bars down  there at a local gin mill.  Now, Dan Whitney.  I mean, Larry the Cable Guy.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Who's the Dan Whitney guy?  Oh, my God.  We're a lot of calling Dan in between breaks, though.  Larry the Cable Guy.  Hey, I just went to visit for a grandma.  She's got Alzheimer's disease.  Try to put her in the home.  It's a nice place.  It's called Packer.  She laughed when I thought of that.  That's Dan before Larry the Cable Guy.  He was a lesbian comedian.  She's just like, sneep, sneep, sneep, sneep, sneep.  Just did everybody, sneep, sneep, sneep. 
[00:06:00]  Get her done.  Get her done.  The angel of death came out of her room all frustrated going, golly, what a bitch.  That's how the angel of death walks, by the way.  She broke her leg the other day.  She was riding her exercise bike in the house.  The brakes went out.  She ran into the couch.  How do I do?  That's him just for us.  She had this dog for like 20 years.  She took it to the vet the other day.  The dog was fine.  Grandma's got worms.  Which explains why she keeps dragging her butt on the carpet. 
[00:06:30]  You know, I couldn't figure that out.  We come over to the house.  She's like, oh, hi, kids.  Come on in.  Good to see you.  How you doing?  Take great care.  Come on in.  Bobby.  Wow.  You're doing it all wrong, my friend.  Yep.  I've got to come up with a character.  I've seen you a million times.  Bobby is hilarious, but he should be doing bigger numbers.  I'm thinking you've got to go redneck or something.  Just change it.  Should I go redneck?  Just redneck?  You've got to do something.  The Midwest.  That was Larry the Cable Guy.  I know he hasn't said it, but that was him.  That was pretty Larry the Cable Guy.  Teach me how to do the accent.  That was before that. 
[00:07:00]  You've just got to kind of just rough up your voice a little bit and put on the twang.  Twang on the voice.  And then he goes, get her done.  But you've got to have a catchphrase like, hey, where are we going?  Hey, where are we going?  That's what I mean.  Hey, where are we going?  All right.  That's the catchphrase.  That's perfect.  Here we go.  Here we go.  My grandmother now.  Wait, wait.  No, no, no.  Do one of your bits, but now we're doing it this way.  Yeah, do it like that.  I'll do an old bit that I used to do when I first started, and it wasn't funny, but 
[00:07:30]  now with the catchphrase, and the accent, and then at the end when you're done, you're  just going, hey, where are we going?  All right, where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we at?  Oh, where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  You want me to write that down?  Because we're taking the audience for a ride.  Get her done.  Where are we going?  Because I would forget that.  I know you too.  Where are we going?  I'm going to write the catchphrase down.  Because it's almost like get her done.  Because it means nothing unless you do your catchphrase down.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Where are we going?  All right, someone introduce me.  Okay.  What's your name? 
[00:08:00]  I've got to come up with a name.  Yeah, you can't be Bob Kelly.  No.  You've got to be like...  Bobby the...  No, no, it's got to be different than Bob.  It's like Billy.  Billy.  Gary Diggs.  No, it's got to be a country name.  Billy.  And you've got to be...  Billy...  Billy the...  Billy Jack.  No, Billy the something.  I have to be something?

Oh, that's good.  Billy the Bass Fisherman.  Oh, yeah.  They love bass fishing. 
[00:08:30]  Billy the Bass Fisherman.  You just picked the worst one.  Oh, my God.  Bass?  It's a long name.  Where's it going?  I hope you're having a good time tonight.  Are you feeling good?  You feeling good?  Yeah.  What?  Can we shorten it to the Bassman?  Billy the Bassman.  Billy the Bassman.  I like that better.  And they just know it's a bass fisherman?  All right.  All right.

She used to come up to me, and she made me want to puke in my goddamn potatoes.  But I'll tell you one thing, though.  She was a good girl.  She was a good girl.  She worked at a toll booth, you know.  Oh, shit.  I forgot the joke.  I'm looking, going, Bobby can't remember his own old joke.  Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.  I'm back, I'm back.

You don't have enough twang.  Not more twang.  Is that more twang?  More twang.  Yeah.  More twang right there.  I'm going to pump you up with some sounds, too.  Well, let's really get into this.

You ever see those films?  Where flies are flying all around the little f***ing fair heads?  I don't know about them.  Oh, God.  That's when the hungry and the ten of them over there.  And the flies are flying around the little f***ing fair heads.  Billy, yeah.  Where are we going?

That f***ing asshole in the back was yelling s*** out all the time.  It was supposed to be hot tea.  My throat is killing me.  You know, his real name's Bob Kelly.  And we have a f***ing audio of his act before he turned into Billy the Bassman.  How funny would that be if I became, listen to me, became the biggest thing in the middle  of America.  And I f***ing, I wouldn't even talk to you guys.  Acknowledged that it was true. 
[00:19:30]  No.  At all.  I f***ing wound up buying this tape to the original so you didn't have it.  Trails around a giant bus.  If we f***ing track the trailers with Billy the Bassman.  Yeah, but ten years down the road, you guys come on my bus and I'm just crying because  I'm this f***ing guy.  My wife left me.  You don't want to be Billy the Bassman.  I don't want to be Billy the Bassman.  I just want to be Bob Kelly.  It's not Bob Kelly.  I just want to eat.  Everywhere you go, they're just like, where are we going?  You're sitting in a f***ing Denny's at 3.30 in the morning trying to eat some eggs.  Hey, Billy, where are we going? 
[00:20:00]  You're like, my name's Bob Kelly.  Shut the f*** up.  Guaranteed that website is already bought.  You're a f***ing dumb fan.  Some cunt just bought where we're going.  How bad do you want to see Bobby actually do this and not break character?  I would love it.  One f***ing set, one time.  But first of all, we'd have to come up with...  You'd have to change your look.  You'd have to get the cam on.  You need a hat with fish hooks in it.  A lot of fishing lures.  I would have to actually go on stage.  I think the microphone stand would have to be made out of a fishing pole. 
[00:20:30]  Holy s***.  Perfect.  And every so often you talk about, it's like, yeah, I was out by my favorite fishing hole the other day.  And you pick up the bike stand and you start, like, you're casting.  And you're holding, you know, and I was fishing me and my buddy.  You know, and I go, where are we going?  I go, we're going to fish.  No, where are we going?  At the end of the show, I cast out t-shirts to the crowd with, where are you going on?  Oh, God damn.  This is such a great act.  Oh, yeah.  It gets worse.  Oh, geez.  More of Old Bean Anthony's worst of 2011 so far coming up on The Virus. 
[00:21:00]  We were actually excited that she was coming in, but we were a little worried that this interview might not go well.  Well, I was a big star pitching her reality show.  She's all over the news all the time.  She's been through so much.  There's so much dirt on her.  We didn't know where to begin.  Unfortunately, she wouldn't let us begin anywhere.  This thing got awkward in a hurry.  Notice the tension in Little Jimmy's voice.  It's Paris Hilton.  The interview.  And it begins now.  Old Bean Anthony's worst of 2011 so far. 
[00:21:30]  I know, I know.  It's really weird.  Here comes Roland.  Roland, Roland, Roland.  We got one assistant.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, niner.  You always know.  Here's the photographer.  Four.  She comes always with the photographer.  Five.  I think we hit it right on the head.  Five or six.  I think we hit it right on the noggin.  Really?  With that one.  Yeah, I think we're done.  Wow. 
[00:22:00]  Cell phones.  Are they bringing it right?  Cell phones.  Okay.  What is Hillary talking to her about?  I don't know.  What is Hillary talking to her about?  Everybody's busy.  Oh, okay.  What's going on there?  What happened to him?  She's getting something to eat.  She looks really good.  Really?  Wow.  She's what?  She looks good.  Look at her.  Yes, Sam.  She's ordering a little brekkie. 
[00:22:30]  Well, that's good.  Brekkie.  I want to punch you.  That's how they call in England.  Do they?  Yeah.  How do you know?  I live there.  In England, you're a cigarette.  I didn't live in England.  I did.  I did.  That's why the schedule and the costume.  No.  You didn't know that?  I asked you once why you talk so silly.  Yeah.  And then you wind up that, hello, Paris.  Hi, Paris.  How are you?  Take a seat.  Welcome to the show.  We're on the air, by the way.  People don't usually realize we're on the air.  Hello. 
[00:23:00]  Hello.  Hi.  Good morning.  We were trying to guess how many people do you come with.  We guessed five.  A publicist, assistant, photographer, somebody from the network.  And who was the other?  And one security.  Was five accurate or no?  Yeah, it was.  Oh, that's a good guess.  Plus, Roland texted me and said, five or six people.  I'm weird when I travel.  I never like to have people around.  I don't like people touching me before I have to be.  Are you weird like that?  No one wants to touch you. 
[00:23:30]  Fair enough.  I'm not saying that everybody's trying to get their hands on this piece.  I don't like being bothered before I'm interviewed.  Did you like Roland?  Was he nice to you?  Yes, very.  Yeah.  Did he creep you out a little bit?  No.  Because he talks really odd.  Nobody understands what he's saying.  He's like, and he has to nod and go, all right, I guess that kind of made sense.  So now you're wandering around promoting The World According to Parents.  Yes.  On Oxygen.  Wednesdays, 10 p.m. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Saw the first episode.  Yeah.  And it starts with you really freaked out over a stalker.  Yes.  I have a couple of those.  But this guy was in your house.  Yeah.  He showed up with two huge knives.  Right.  And thank God my boyfriend was there to protect me.  How close did he get?  Because, I mean, you live in a big place, obviously.  Yeah.  He was, like, right by the kitchen.  And we got him.  So thank God he didn't get to me.  You're not packing any heat? 
[00:24:30]  I'm not.  You ought to pack some heat there, Paris.  We have some heat at the house.  Nice.  They talk about that.  Tell me to bring knives to a gunfight.  Her boyfriend pulled a gun.  Good for him.  But it's like a reality show.  Normally it doesn't deal with stuff that heavy.  I was kind of surprised that they opened with something.  Yeah.  A guy who was actually, she's like, he was there to stamper.  Yeah.  That wasn't, like, a light-hearted way to open a shot.  The show opens huge, absolutely.  Why didn't he shoot?  He had every right to shoot, right?  Yeah, probably.  Because it would have been too much.  That's a mess, right?  Yeah.  He didn't want to clean up the blood and all that. 
[00:25:00]  That'd be funny.  They could play wacky music while you're just cleaning up blood.  You're both digging a hole in the yard.  Ah, what are we going to do with this guy?  That would make for a great reality show.  It really would.  That would be good.  You're murdering and burying stalkers.  Oh, that Paris.  Boy, would people be shocked at the first episode.  Yes.  Coming up next week, the murder of the guy who's been bothering her on Twitter.  You tease it every week.  Some new creep is dead.  Yeah, you say you get a lot of stalkers and stuff like that.  I'm sure there are probably different levels, like guys that come to your house with knives  and then guys on Twitter and online and stuff like that. 
[00:25:30]  You get a lot of harassment that way?  There's a lot of weird people out there.  Yeah.  I just don't.  I block them on Twitter.  You do?  Do you take some of that to heart?  Like, we talk to a lot of people and some people say, well, I don't care what they say  or something like that.  But do some people kind of, you read something and you go, you son of a bitch, you kind of  got, yet like they kind of got to you a little bit, make you mad?  You know, I'm a human just like anyone else.  So if I read something.  No way.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:26:00]  You're a superhuman.  I don't pay attention anymore.  Really?  Yeah.  There's been so many lies and ridiculous things written about me that at this point, I don't  pay attention to it.  It is a little hard to figure out what's true and what's not about you because there has  been so much written over the years.  And some of it like so outrageous that you're like, that can't possibly be true.  And then other things that it's like, all right, I could see that.  But have you read things that you're like, wow, where the hell did this come from?  It's complete fabrication. 
[00:26:30]  It happens all the time.  Really?  There's actually this lookalike and she lives in LA and New York and I always get blamed  for things that she does.  Oh, sure.  There's no, I'm not kidding.  You can literally go online and she has a website.  She looks exactly like me.  Really?  What was the worst thing she did as you?  She like during New York fashion week, she'll go to all the shows.  She doesn't sit front row.  She'll go to the gifting suites and get all this free stuff, pretending it's me.  Damn.  It's just annoying.  Yeah.  Wow.  For you, for her, that's great. 
[00:27:00]  I wish I looked like somebody other than just, I just look like somebody that doesn't  belong in any kind of an event.  Like even when I belong there, they're like, do you have ID?  What is that?  What is your relationship with the paparazzi?  Because we always wonder like, cause they're so hateable, but then again, celebrities use them  because they can help promote a film before it comes out.  I mean, they do serve a purpose.  So do you kind of have a love hate relationship with them?  You know, just like anything, there's good and bad.  They are really annoying when it's every single day following me everywhere I go.  So I think it's okay to be at like a red carpet event where they're supposed to be, but 
[00:27:30]  just everyday life, it just gets really invasive.  Well, you, like you, there's a scene in the, in the show where you're, you had community  service and you had to kind of clean walls as part of the community service and the  paparazzi is literally five feet away just snapping photos.  Is that irritating or is it like kind of, that kind of comes with the territory?  It's I'm, I've been doing this for 15 years, so it's been a very long time.  You just get used to them.  But the community service, she didn't take it seriously, Jimmy.  She was goofing around a little bit.  Yeah.  It wasn't exactly a heavy sentence.  She was very mad that she wasn't painting the wall properly. 
[00:28:00]  Even community service, you like having a little bit of fun.  Well, she brought another person.  I just want to show her that I saw the show.  She brought her assistant.  So it was two people working on the wall that day.  So she's thinking maybe she should get double time.  It's a good idea, right?  Because you brought people with you.  Yeah, she brought it up too.  And the guy like who could care less that Paris is painting a wall wasn't happy with you.  What was the community service for?  I just have to do something for a little thing.  A little thing. 
[00:28:30]  There was a little mishap.  Really?  You're an assistant, by the way.  You're out of your mind.  You're a little too wild, I think.  No, not anymore.  Not anymore?  Have you?  I'm so busy.  I run a huge brand.  I have 17 different product lines.  I'm constantly traveling the world, working.  So, yeah, I'm way too busy.  No more time for complete shenanigans?  No, I'm actually getting up every morning early.  Sucks.  Living life to the fullest. 
[00:29:00]  Do you still stand up late, though, a little bit?  Not really.  Take a drink every so often?  Not really.  No more partying for Paris?  No, I've grown up.  Jesus Christ.  The apocalypse is coming.  Did spending time in jail kind of change you at all?  Did it make you go like, ugh, I really don't want to do something that causes me to come  here for a long period of time?  I spent one night in jail doing a radio stunt, and I'm like, I will never go back.  Misbehave.  One night made me never want to go back.  It's just a disgusting, horrible place.  Yeah, it's pretty brutal.  So what did it do for you?  Did it make you not want to get high anymore or party anymore? 
[00:29:30]  How did it change you?  I've really grown up.  I'm an adult, and I just have so much to live for.  Do you see other celebrities like Lindsay and go like, oh boy, what she's going through?  Like, you want to smack her in the face or something?  No, I wish her the best, you know?  Yeah, but there's got to be something in you that goes like, okay, I've been there.  I've seen where that leads.  I just wish her the best.  You know, she's going through a lot, and I thank God that I have such an incredible 
[00:30:00]  family behind me.  Yeah.  And I think that's what it's about.  Yeah, that's just it.  Like, you don't have any of these deep-seated family problems that would have led you to  do things like drugs and hanging out and partying and shit.  So what do you attribute that to, just wanting to have fun as a kid?  Yeah, I think everyone goes through things when they're younger, and you experience life,  and you learn from your mistakes.  Not with cameras around, though.  Not everybody, anyway. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, that's true.  It seems true, in L.A., at least, celebrities, it's hard to...  A lot of times, celebrities get away with more, and it almost, like, it kind of sets you  up for when they fall.  What is that about?  Nothing.  I just want to come here to talk about the show.  I don't really want to talk about Lindsay and things like that.  It's kind of a waste of time.  What I was talking about, like, you know...  I was actually...  Tributing it to you, though.  I was actually talking about you.  I was saying...  I saw the look.  Yeah, but the question was, celebrities get away with more. 
[00:31:00]  Does it make it harder?  Because without certain things stopping you along the way, when you finally do get in  trouble, it's big.  So that's kind of what I was getting at.  All right, let's move on.  Okay, tell us all about the show.  I guess we'll just talk about the show.  The World According to Paris is amazing, and it's on every Wednesday on Oxygen at 10 p.m.,  and, yeah, everyone was writing me on Twitter and saying how much they love it and how funny  it is, so I'm very proud and excited.  Are you annoyed? 
[00:31:30]  You sound annoyed now.  It's very early in the morning, I'm tired.  She sounds annoyed.  I know.  I've been on a press tour all week.  You know, it's been a lot of work.  We didn't want to annoy you.  I'm a little annoyed.  Are you annoyed, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Jimmy gets very annoyed.  Only because I'm not asking a jerk question, and I'm not being a dick.  I watch the show.  I like the show more than I thought I would like it.  I thought it was ballsy the way they started off, but it's a legit question. 
[00:32:00]  It's not a, hey, what about, I'm not trying to get a sound bite.  I mean, it's a real question, and the show is a reality show, so kind of asking about  your reality, I think it's fair game.  I'm not asking it in some tabloid way.  Yeah, it was more like just a lifestyle question.  Does it make it harder?  Yeah.  I understand, Jimmy.  Paris didn't.  Fair enough.  She doesn't want to talk about that.  No.  She wants to talk about the show.  That's why I'm here.  Well, what other hijinks you get into in the show? 
[00:32:30]  You know, every episode, you never know what's going to happen.  My life is very unpredictable.  Yeah.  Skydiving, traveling, going all around the world.  Kind of an honest assessment of what you go through in your daily life?  Yeah, definitely.  Following around, the cameras, interacting with your family and friends.  Everyone.  It's pretty crazy.  Your assistant writes porn, and there's a conflict about that.  I don't know if I'm allowed to go there, but it's in the show, so I figured I'd ask about it. 
[00:33:00]  Did she stay away from writing it?  Because I know that she had to make a decision.  So what did she finally do?  You have to stay tuned and watch the show and find out.  But I...  Okay.  So we'll talk about...  I wasn't happy about that.  Fair enough.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  I won.  Wow.  You're a tough one, Paris.  You're a little tough.  You know, we have a lot of people in and out of here, and some are easy, some are a little tough. 
[00:33:30]  You threw us a little with that little spin around and the want to talk about the show thing.  But the show, if the show's about your life, you know, we were just kind of leading up to getting to know you a little more about your life and stuff.  So I think you kind of took that in a weird way.  I think a lot of people followed her lead.  I mean, you've moved on to other things, but, you know, the partying and the oopsie shots going in and out of limos.  Yeah, you kind of were, you know, at the forefront of that whole thing that was going on.  You introduced the world to Kim Kardashian. 
[00:34:00]  Where are you at with her?  We're great.  We're fine.  You guys are still friends and all?  Yeah, I wish her the best.  She wishes everyone the best.  I know.  I'm happy for her.  That's great.  She's getting married, and I'm really happy for her.  You don't hang out anymore with her, though?  I'm so busy.  I'm traveling the world all the time, so I don't really have time to hang out with all my friends.  Oh, I got a good question.  Obviously, you grew up with Nicole Richie, Lionel Richie's daughter.  What about that big clay head in Lionel Richie's video, Hello? 
[00:34:30]  Do you ever see it?  No, I haven't seen that.  I love that song, though.  God, I'm obsessed with the big clay head.  I have to check it out on YouTube.  I haven't seen it.  Because I thought it was on display somewhere in Lionel Richie's house, and I would assume  you would have been there at some point in your life and seen the big clay head.  I haven't seen that one yet.  Oh, well.  Jimmy?  I'll check it out next time.  I'm trying to think of something from the show. 
[00:35:00]  There is a scene where she's driving a pink Rolls Royce, I think, which is a nice car.  Is that yours?  It's a Bentley.  Is it a Bentley?  Thank you.  Yes.  What's it like to just be so completely rich?  I've worked for everything that I've achieved on my own.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  I feel very blessed.  I thank God every day.  Now, worked in what way?  Well, I run 17 different product lines.  I have created my entire business out of it. 
[00:35:30]  Now.  I've been working since I'm 15 years old.  Yeah?  What was your first job?  This has been a long time making a model.  A model.  Yes.  Well, that makes sense.  I would never.  I'm not going to dis-models.  Did you have a preconceived notion?  Because a lot of people come in here and they think that we're going to be a certain way.  Or they think that we're going to be aggressive with them.  Or they think that we're going to try to do something awful.  So they kind of come in defensive because they're expecting something that we're not going to.  Honestly.  Yeah.  I've seen that before.  I've seen it happen.  And I've walked into radio stations or whatever where I think that they're going to be a certain way and it's okay.  Did you have a preconceived notion about us? 
[00:36:00]  Honestly.  No.  No.  She's just on a radio tour.  She's being very defensive about like I could see the way you're sitting like you're on guard and you don't need to be.  Like I don't know why.  We're not trying to screw you over.  We're trying to help you promote the show.  But it's a reality show and we're asking you about life and you're getting like a little.  Right.  The world according to Paris.  Yeah.  It's on Wednesdays at 10 on the oxygen.  Huge.  So we thought we could talk about the world.  Yeah.  We are.  That world according to you. 
[00:36:30]  That you live in.  Which is very different than the average person.  That's why it makes for a good show.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So as the season goes on, what kind of situations are we going to see you in?  Everything.  There's a lot of fighting going on.  There's a lot of drama.  Now the fighting and drama with who?  Family members?  With my friends, my boyfriend, my mom.  Just like anyone.  How's your relationship going?  Good?  It's going really good and I'm really happy.  Yeah?  Oh, that means. 
[00:37:00]  How long have you been going out?  Like a year and a half.  A year and a half?  Oh, that means they don't break up during the show.  Well, how do you know?  Because the show's already filmed.  Oh.  Damn it.  What a.  There is a good fight scene in the first one with the camera in the car.  I won't give it away.  You have to stay tuned.  There is a good argument, which I did enjoy watching.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Jimmy's really annoyed.  Yeah, I am.  But whatever.  I mean, I did enjoy the show.  I'm not going to tell you I didn't like the show.  I didn't expect to like the show, but I did.  And I'm not your target demo. 
[00:37:30]  Well, thank you.  But I did like the show.  I thought the way you started was, and I'm even saying this irritated.  I have to be very honest.  The way it started.  It's very weird.  Was ballsy.  I didn't expect them to go into a genuine statement about stalkers.  It wasn't cute.  It was done for real.  And they addressed stalkers a little bit, who I have a particular hatred for.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the way you addressed them and kind of mocked them and shit on them a little bit, I thought was.  Yeah, I've had.  I like that a lot. 
[00:38:00]  Again, I don't want to give away any dialogue.  Just stay tuned.  Watch the show.  You'll get everything.  Roland's doing the wrap-up signal.  That's a shame.  He's doing a wrap-up signal.  All right.  They were worried we were going to talk about the sex tape.  We weren't going to fuck with you for that.  None of that stuff.  I mean, we were just going to ask real questions.  Just real little lifestyle questions.  But it's all about the world according to Paris.  Yes.  So tune in.  Paris, thank you very much for stopping by.  Thank you, boys.  No, I just was going to wonder if it was...  Because for people to watch a reality show, they want to know that they're seeing your life for real as it is. 
[00:38:30]  Yes.  You cannot write the things that happen.  It's nuts.  I love it.  I don't know if we sold the show today.  No.  We didn't sell it at all.  We did.  Our listeners don't like her.  What?  Yeah, they don't really like you for some reason.  I spoke highly about the show.  But I wasn't bullshitting when I spoke highly about the show.  I really wasn't.  I mean, if I didn't like it, believe me, right now I would tell you, but I did like it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, they're all getting up to Roland's standing at the window, just peering out. 
[00:39:00]  But Paris, thank you very much.  Thank you.  For stopping in.  And good luck with the show.  Thank you, guys.  Take care.  Have a fun morning.  We're not going to get off the air.  We just can't keep talking.  So feel free to remove your headphones and, you know, whatever.  We even took a photo together a while ago.  I was going to ask you to sign it, but I don't want to bother you.  I don't mind.  Are you sure?  Because, I mean, I hate to be more of a bother than I've been already, obviously.  Oh, you're sweet.  Oh, no.  Thanks.  This is a good shot of us, too.  Look at that picture, right? 
[00:39:30]  Look at how unshaven I am.  I have gray hair.  Oh, that's cute.  Thanks.  That's a nice picture, right?  Roland, where did it go wrong?  Roland?  Where did it go wrong, you think?  Where did it go wrong?  Jimmy's almost swallowing his teeth.  I'm not that bad.  It's fun to watch.  Thank you.  Thank you, Paris.  Bye, guys.  There she goes.  All right.  Paris Hilton.  Out the door.  Remember to say goodbye to Roland. 
[00:40:00]  He's a very nice gentleman.  Take it easy.  You forgot your phone.  Oh, damn.  I wasn't going to say anything.  Zach, wow.  That could have been huge.  Huge.  Could have gotten some pictures.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  O.P.  Anthony's worst of 2011 so far.  Roland, a little, what happened?  No, no, don't stand.  Sit down.  You're going to be here a while.  Yeah, Kenny's got something.  What?  I got the quote direct from her mouth. 
[00:40:30]  What?  She said, and I quote, I am not going to sit and waste my time being berated, end quote.  When, just now?  Yes, walking out.  But we didn't berate her.  About what?  I don't know.  One of the ladies in her entourage was making excuses out there that she probably doesn't  feel like playing because she's tired.  We weren't playing.  We weren't playing.  It's a reality show.  It's called an interview.  When she comes in here, I understand they want to plug the show, but we can't just sit 
[00:41:00]  here for 10, 15 minutes saying the name of the show, the time it's on, and who's in  it.  We have to get the people kind of involved and listening to her story.  Maybe something that hasn't been heard.  What a spoiled human being.  And I'm going to tell you, I bit my tongue for the better of the show.  Yes, and for you, Roland.  By the way, we fucking were nice for you.  If we hear one word of shit from a publicist about that, we would not move to her.  No, nobody said anything. 
[00:41:30]  I have never.  You'll hear something.  And I'm not going to blast her now.  They're on your side, though.  They're all on your side.  They're more of the...  What?  They were saying, give me her number for you.  What?  We should have atom-bombed her.  No, it wasn't.  Now that I'm thinking about it, we should have.  It wasn't worth burning bridges for other things.  I don't care about the bridges.  It was just too easy.  It was like, she's just going to sit there and just walk away like a baby.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:42:00]  And I was so fucking aggravated.  I played that out in my head.  But there was no glaying into her.  It just would have hurt relationships that Roland has with people.  I don't want to fucking do that.  But it was obvious that she was annoying us.  Beyond comprehension.  Back there, all her people, they said nothing about you guys.  They were always just saying, oh, no, she's having Wednesdays.  I don't care.  I've never held back like that.  I've never.  Again, I'm not going to say it now that she's not here.  I've never held back like that in my life. 
[00:42:30]  You can call her spoiled, Brett.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You get her back in here for one more question, I'll give you a thousand bucks.  She ain't coming back.  A thousand bucks.  I'll go right to the fucking bank.  The fact that she thought she was berated is mind-boggling.  I have one more question.  I mean, that's an awesome deal, but I don't think she was going to come back.  Why?  I don't know.  Just saying the guys want to talk to you.  Because we're despicable.  How are we?  We're awful people that we're trying to just ask her questions. 
[00:43:00]  I mean, very careful and nice.  I was so fucking nice to her.  There's nothing I hate more than when you...  How spoiled are you where you think that legit questions...  Do celebrities get away with more?  And does that eventually hurt because you're not getting stopped on the way?  That to me is a...  You want to do a...  That's a real question.  And again, I should have fucking melted down with her so I can't do it now because she's gone.  That's a pussy move.  Yeah, we hate when we...  Yeah, you're right.  No, I'm not going to do that.  We try not to do that.  But there were things that were addressed when she was here. 
[00:43:30]  The Lindsay Lohan thing.  And I said to her...  I said, we weren't trying to get anything out of you that isn't just...  You know, because she had the same experiences growing up.  I was like, what do you think about what she's going through and what you went through and  equate it?  And she's just like, eh, take a minute.  It's not like I was saying, what's the dirt on Lindsay?  Can you tell me what you've seen her do?  So that's different than saying she's going through something that you went through with  the press in your face while you're going through this time.  What, you know...  She was awful. 
[00:44:00]  What's your opinion on that situation?  She was atrocious.  And she was annoyed when I asked the first question about how many people, but I even  equated it to myself because I didn't want her to think that I was saying, hey, how many  people do you drive with like a dick?  I was just saying that I personally hate when a publicist comes with me anywhere.  I hate being fawned over before.  Like, I want to be left alone.  So I was like, eh, maybe, you know, do you hate that?  Does it bug you to have so many...  It's great.  It's just atrocious.  So if you want to watch the show on the way she sold it, fair enough.  It's great.  I'm happy I said right in front of her, where did it all go wrong?  It was just, oh... 
[00:44:30]  I regret...  The second she turned around and looked at a publicist...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  I'm getting a great text right now, and I believe this, and now this second's my thought.  She feels like she's too good to be there.  I felt that.  Oh, yeah.  I absolutely felt that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the reason she has to be here is the reviews on the show are horrendous.  Horrendous.  And also...  Whatever.  I wrote... 
[00:45:00]  I wrote this to someone last night, watching Paris' new show, Not Good.  I didn't like it.  I thought it was better.  I figured I would play it cool for once.  It's not my...  I like the show.  I'm not her target demo, but it was better than I thought it was going to be.  Again, I can't...  I got to be honest, or I would have...  Believe me, I would have blasted it in front of her.  I didn't fucking watch it.  I didn't like it.  I watched two seconds of it, turned it off.  I was a fan of The Simple Life. 
[00:45:30]  I thought Nicole Richie was hilarious.  This show needs Nicole Richie.  It's Simple Life without Nicole Richie.  I'm not going to sit there and be berated.  Who said that?  What are you talking about?  She did.  To who?  On the way out.  Kenny just said that.  On the way out.  That's what she said.  Berated?  I've never held back...  You don't think that you can be annoying?  She...  Atrocious.  I love that when it goes, stop, when she says...  She didn't make her own money.  Yeah, it's like...  It works for everything I have.  It's one of the richest families in the world. 
[00:46:00]  Everyone knows you didn't work for your...  That's why it was like...  Maybe making some money now.  Did you hear what she said?  She runs 17 different brands.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  What's wrong with you?  That's work?  How many brands do you run there, mister?  Well, I run zero.  None.  Brands.  Exactly.  None.  I am...  I...  Where is she now?  She's doing Larry Flick.  Who's Larry Flick?  The gay channel.  The gay channel.  All right, so she's going to come walking back this time.  I don't want to fuck with her now.  It's like she was in and I didn't blast her.  I should have... 
[00:46:30]  It was like a real conscious effort.  I let her know I was annoyed.  But I was like, what's the way to do it?  Do you blow it up and then she just walks out and we don't get guests?  What's the right fucking move?  But that was extraordinarily...  That interview could have been played this past weekend.  Well, part two is around the corner.  Sorry, during the awkward interviews segment.  Sam Roberts is in studio.  Sam.  Sam Roberts.  Did you hear the entire Paris Hilton interview?  You bet I did.  So, opinion, comment, what was happening? 
[00:47:00]  How you maybe would have handled it?  Just a little, you know, give us something.  Well, I was very excited about the Paris Hilton interview as I'm a big pop culture junkie.  Yeah.  I kind of felt like the way she responded to the first question of...  Set the tone.  Yeah.  And she didn't really come out of that.  That's not to say it was a bad question because another person would have said, yeah, five.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't really like them, but it's kind of necessary.  And then you move on to the next thing. 
[00:47:30]  She immediately...  I mean, she was kind of shut down before she even got in here.  I think there was this feeling of...  But she was like...  I'm sorry.  She was like that before.  Yes.  Because she was ordering and she didn't come right in.  So...  And she didn't take off her big sunglasses.  Yeah.  The giant sunglasses.  Better than...  Better than...  Better than us.  Better than the room.  Better than the show.  She gave me a present.  She didn't want to be here.  Right.  Simple as that.  Exactly.  And it was tough.  We were going for an angle there.  It's a reality show.  She invented people being famous for no fucking reason.  She has now moved on to being famous for other things. 
[00:48:00]  But she started out as just a beautiful girl that's famous.  And no one can figure out why.  And since then, there has been people like Kim Kardashian.  Believe it or not, Lindsay Lohan lately is famous for doing nothing but partying and  showing parts of her body by accident.  So we were going somewhere with all that.  Extremely...  Pop the sex tape up for when she walks by.  Extremely...  Pop the sex tape up.  Unrevealing.  We'd have to close this block.  We'd have to close the curtains.  Extremely...  This place.  Really not a revealing person at all. 
[00:48:30]  And if you're going to watch a reality show, you would hope that somebody revealed it.  Revealed something.  Like a legit question was, the girl who did your assistant was writing porn.  Did she stay with that or what did she do?  Do you really think that a teaser like you have to watch is more interesting?  Oh, I know.  You went through a thing where it's like...  And I was listing shit that's happened in the show.  I had obviously watched it. 
[00:49:00]  Right, right.  Where it's like, hey, what happened with that?  You'll have to watch the show.  What was the right move there?  Because I really wanted to be a fucking dick.  And then I'm like...  That was an atom bomb situation that we would have been within our means of doing.  We could have.  But again, like Jimmy even said, it could have been so easy.  And then she just went, uh, Smokey, goodbye.  She's not a tough...  The thing was, someone got to her and said, look, if this show's going to work, you're  going to have to do things you've never done before, like radio. 
[00:49:30]  You know, radio sucks to a lot of these A-listers.  Like, why the fuck do I have to do radio shows?  But they said, look, if this show's going to have a chance, you're going to have to do  all this stuff.  I'm not going to.  You're going to be out of your comfort zone.  And instead of going with it, she came, she sat out there ordering breakfast, knowing  that we were like, come on in.  And then she sat down and then she had her glasses on and she was just like...  Yeah, she was a mope.  She was a fucking mope because she didn't want to be here.  She didn't give that to Piers Morgan the other night. 
[00:50:00]  She was all chipper and fucking rocking the interview.  She was very revealing with Piers Morgan.  Of course.  Yeah, she sat there barely talking, pulling teeth to get three words.  More than three words at a time out of her.  And we're the fucking assholes.  I apologize to the audience.  I apologize.  No, I don't.  They aren't even worth fucking hearing anything good.  I don't know not to fucking Piers people.  I meet them.  They suck.  I don't at all because it was entertaining in another way, man.  It was so uncomfortable in here.  But it was...  I was openly laughing at how uncomfortable it was. 
[00:50:30]  I'm so annoyed.  And I should have been more vocalized how disgusted I was.  You don't give yourself...  Your passive aggressiveness and your annoyances come through loudly and clearly.  Oh, it came through very, very clearly.  Especially the audience that knows you.  But it's almost like I can't...  I want to blast her right now so bad my head almost hurts.  But that was part of the fun of like...  Even in the other room, us watching, we were all...  Travis and me were laughing because we knew how badly you wanted to blast her.  And we could sense that. 
[00:51:00]  But it's like...  The thing is, Jimmy, Jimmy, here's what it is.  She wasn't giving anything that was blast-worthy.  Right.  She wasn't saying anything mean.  She was just being...  I almost wish she had been nasty.  Exactly.  But here's the deal.  Don't feel that you can't voice your opinion of how the interview went, how she was in blunt terms.  Because we understood, and believe me, I understood also the situation we were in.  There are people... 
[00:51:30]  You can't burn bridges.  I don't want to get Roland in a bad position with publicists and whatnot.  And that's the only reason that I kept my mouth shut.  But I could call her a fucking cunt now that she's not here without feeling like I'm a pussy for not calling her a cunt when she was here.  Because I didn't want to fuck with the publicists.  No, no.  I understand that.  I know how this game works.  But the publicists are one thing, and we've been really good with that.  But this was legit.  She was awful.  Terrible interview. 
[00:52:00]  Terrible interview, not revealing at all.  And it was like one of those people who didn't want to be here.  Yeah.  Everything I despise, because I'm very revealing in interviews.  Yes.  And I just, again, I can't blast her now, because I should have blasted her when she was here, because she deserved it.  What's one thing you want to say?  You're a fucking horrible interview.  You're an extraordinarily coddled, unrevealing person.  Not to Opie.  To her.  I'm not.  I'll just blonde hair confuse me.  Shut up.  Enough with the shit. 
[00:52:30]  What?  I'm fucking around.  He's joking.  We all trash each other here.  I was going to say Jimmy, but it's just funny.  I was actually going to say me.  I would love to have said that, but I didn't.  So, again, to me, it's an absolute pussy move to not say it and then say it when they're out the door.  And I just, I mean, I've gone after people before.  What's two things you would say to her?  That was the main thing.  It's like your problem is, this is why you're extraordinarily uninteresting to me, 
[00:53:00]  because you have not one ounce of ability to be revealing and reveal something about yourself.  Sam.  Sorry.  I just, I should have told her that she stunk as an interview.  Did she?  No, as an interview.  She looked good.  She was tired.  No, we did, though.  What?  We really did.  We called her out.  Yeah, we did.  We absolutely called her out.  I said that the listeners aren't digging her.  They find her.  What did I say?  I said they don't like you.  She did not leave here thinking this went well. 
[00:53:30]  Believe me.  But she didn't care, because she didn't want to be here to begin with.  Right.  So she doesn't give a fuck, because she doesn't give a fuck about radio.  Right.  But someone got to her and said, this is what you're going to have to do for this project.  Someone on Twitter said you completely caved when you asked for your picture signed.  I will tell you, legitimately, that was kind of done to be annoying.  Yeah.  I'll never hang this.  Honestly, I was beyond being starstruck at that point.  I was legitimately aggravated.  That's why when...  I was surprised she did it.  When I said, Roland is saying wrap this up, it was like, okay, you can take your headphones off and leave. 
[00:54:00]  Like, we're still going to stay.  We're not going to break to take pictures with you.  Like, it wasn't a situation.  I knew no one wanted a fucking picture with her at that point.  When Jim said, I would ask you to sign this, but I don't want to bother you.  Yeah.  I don't want to bother you.  That was just such a passive-aggressive...  And then he goes, because I've been such a bother.  Did I say that?  Yes, you did.  It was funny.  Really?  You underestimate, like, the brattiness and passive-aggressiveness that you combat people with. 
[00:54:30]  It hits on a different level.  Yeah, it really does.  Absolutely.  But it's hard.  It's nauseating what you do.  I know that.  But again, I'm only saying, it ain't about me, but I literally, if I'm going to be a certain way now...  Not that I...  I wouldn't have called her a cunt, because she honestly didn't do anything that merited  being verbally abused like that.  Oh, wait, E-Rock.  E-Rock's coming in.  Do you have something?  No.  Does he ever?  E-Rock, yeah.  Ow.  He pushed me.  She left.  She's gone.  She blew everybody else off, and the Oxygen people are like, why did we do Opie and Anthony? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, see?  They blame us.  Fuck you, you fucking Oxygen cocksuckers, then.  How long ago?  She blew off every other station she was supposed to.  Did she do another interview?  Nope.  And Oxygen people are like, oh, Opie and Anthony shouldn't have done that show.  No, we're not going to get the blame for this.  It's not our fucking...  Don't blame us, because your fucking client was being an uninteresting piece of shit.  She was terrible, and I've never held back like that in my life.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  We held back.  We were trying to be nice. 
[00:55:30]  I couldn't have been nicer to her.  We were trying to make it work.  But you know what?  This is exactly what I thought was going to happen when I was thinking about this interview  last night.  I just knew it wasn't going to work.  I could not have been fucking nicer to her.  I could...  It was...  Roland!  No fucking way, man.  I ain't taking the blame for this one.  Hold on.  No fucking way on this one.  Not one word of blame.  I never said anything to you.  No, no.  It's not your fault.  I'm giving you ammunition now.  No fucking way on this one.  There are times I'm like, yeah, I guess we might have pushed it or that and blah, blah.  No fucking way. 
[00:56:00]  Let me see it.  Look at the unsigned E-Rock.  The unsigned picture of E-Rock and Paris Hilton.  Unsigned.  Forever, forever unsigned.  That's funny.  And look, he's got one hand in his pocket.  Not forever.  You want it to look like you two are going out.  No.  You want to put this on classmates.com?  No.  Me and my girlfriend, Paris Hilton.  We would have done it a long time ago. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  I'm sorry.  It's not even the bad one.  Remember this one?  Oh, wait, wait.  There's another one?  There's another one you guys gave me shit for.  Oh, with your bedroom eyes.  You guys remember this one?  E-Rock with his bedroom eyes.  Look at this picture.  Look at E-Rock.  He's in love.  Where's she now?  What are you doing, Roland?  Roland.  The information.  You need to make a few phone calls.  You need to get some fucking answers, Roland. 
[00:57:00]  And again, Oxygen may have just fucked them.  But again, they might not have heard the interview.  They may just...  Yeah, they do, though.  Her publicist was right here, so...  No, no, but did Oxygen hear it?  No, Herpublicist seemed almost cool with everything.  I'm going to call that network carbon monoxide from now on.  It's a chemical joke.  Attaboy.  She was fine with it, and Oxygen, for the interview.  She was atrocious.  Every station that was supposed to have her is going to blame us for fucking that up.  They're going to complain to management, and we're going to catch the shit for being mean to Paris Hilton? 
[00:57:30]  No, we won't.  Fuck you.  Fuck her.  Fuck Oxygen.  Fuck Alcu.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck it.  Fuck, fuck, fuck a fuck.  I'm tired of it.  Damn.  Part one of Bobo, the one-man band.  This might be my favorite Bobo saga of all time, and he's been in quite a few sagas.  Bobo, the one-man band, it started right here, when we came to the air and said, Bobo wants  to come back on, and he's got characters that we've been developing with him in the back 
[00:58:00]  office.  This all, he went through all the characters until we got on the air and developed the  one-man band, the character that made Bobo famous.  The one-man band begins right now.  Opie Anthony's worst of 2011 so far.  Where's the fugitive?  Is he around?  Oh, yeah.  Blair is Bobo.  Wasn't he bitching yesterday on fucking Twitter that he's not on the show again? 
[00:58:30]  Bitching?  He was on hold.  He's out of control.  He was on hold for three hours yesterday, because he wants to, I guess, invite me to  a Mets game or something.  You gotta let him invite him.  You gotta go.  That's good.  You gotta.  I would probably go.  Sit way up top.  I'd probably go.  No, sit in there.  There's fucking, why I'm tied?  There's fucking nothing but seats available.  The Mets are horrible this year.  Oh, come on.  It's so early.  What's their record?  Anyone know?  No. 
[00:59:00]  No, I don't really follow the Mets these days.  What's up, Sam?  No.  Sam has something on Bobo?  Not the pretty Bobo.  No, no, no.  All right.  The even prettier Bobo.  That's right.  On Friday, when, you know, we weren't on the air, all day, he was calling people who work  here.  Mainly me.  Yeah.  But he was literally on the, and he kept calling Liam, too.  The talent booker, asking why he can't be booked on Owen.  The talent booker?  Yes, he keeps, like, and I'm going Bobo.  Now, how would he get the talent booker's number? 
[00:59:30]  Well, because once, Liam got him an XM subscription or something like that, I don't remember what  it was, and Bobo saved his number.  Very clever.  Very clever.  Bobo's smart for a retard.  Very clever.  Yeah, for a retard.  But he, like, he doesn't understand, I go, Bobo, you have to, you know, there's lots  of people who want to come on the show.  We're doing a show.  You can't just say, well, I want to come on and start yelling and crying and expect  to come on.  You have to actually have something.  But he doesn't.  I mean, that's not his way of thinking.  Well, doesn't he have characters? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  I've seen every time he's been sitting out there in the hallway, never coming in the  show.  Yeah.  But sitting out in the hallway.  I walk out and Bobo has just a multitude of new characters.  Well, we've been brainstorming characters with him on the phone so he can come in with  some new stuff.  What is the, what are the, give me one character.  Uh, one character was Daniel Curlin, the gay abused car salesman.  The gay, Daniel Curlin, the gay abused car salesman.  But you see, it's a different Daniel Curlin. 
[01:00:30]  It's just a coincidence that they have the same name.  That they have the same name.  Right.  All right.  We'll, we'll interview him as characters.  Yeah.  Just characters.  But we need three.  Tell him.  There was another one.  Fuck it.  He just found it way back on the show.  I haven't written down.  Let me go.  There was one guy who, who was the guy who was afraid of the post office?  He created this character who was afraid of the post office and we went through some  improv exercises and the guy, well, the guy was afraid of the post office because he thought  that somebody was sending him mail bombs and one day as Bobo in the character, he got a 
[01:01:00]  package and he opened it and it turned out to be a mail bomb.  And it was a mail bomb.  So that character died.  So he won't be on the air.  Oh, he won't be on.  That's ironic, by the way.  What was his name?  I, that's what Danny's looking up.  We can't even remember, but his mother is now a character.  So Bobo now portrays his, that character's mother.  Wow.  Wow.  Nice.  Wow.  He's a weirdo.  He was jabbing a fucking coat hanger into his crotch. 
[01:01:30]  Oh fuck.  He has to come on and do this.  Well, I, as characters, yes, I would, uh, I would accept that.  You're back.  You didn't, you don't have the list.  I just, I just remembered what the characters, it's mullet man.  Oh, it was mullet man.  It was mullet man.  It was the guy who was afraid of the post.  He was in the post office who died.  So now Bobo's other character is mullet man's mom.  Oh.  Let me say hi to, uh, wow.  This is Holly Bobo.  Holly Bobo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it's true.  Yes, this is mullet man's mom.  Wait, who the heck took that, put that, put that bomb there.  He was so wrong.  Wait, wait a minute.  Now something happened to your son?  Yeah, he put a mail bomb.  A mail bomb?  Yeah, it's right.  He took a bag of his, the city said he put a bag that he was waiting for. 
[01:02:30]  Now, wasn't he afraid of a mail bomb for so many years?  He kept talking and please take the package, take the package.  And then what happened?  He took a package.  And, and, and it, it blew up?  Hello?  Is he getting in trouble for doing characters? 
[01:03:00]  He's like, I'm doing good character on the show.  Oh my God, look at Anson Williams.  Uh, so, hello?  I'm sorry about that, but my mom was, uh, buttering me.  Mullet man's mom's mom.  Mullet man's great grandma.  That's mullet man's...  ...grand...  What happened?  What happened there?  She was, she was asleep. 
[01:03:30]  Well, I can't hear you.  You gotta speak up.  Yell.  She was asleep.  We didn't want to wake her up.  Well, we can't hear you, so if, if, if, uh...  I don't want to wake her up.  We can't hear you.  You gotta speak louder.  We cannot hear you.  You gotta speak up.  I didn't want to wake her up.  Oh, okay.  You didn't want to wake her up.  Uh, where is mullet man now?  Six feet under.  Oh, he did die in that explosion?  Yes.  We can't hear you.  You gotta be louder. 
[01:04:00]  He did.  Yeah?  What did the explosion sound like?  What did the explosion sound like?  I can't hear you, ma'am.  You're on the radio right now.  You have to be louder.  Yeah, come on.  It just sounds like wind.  Yes, wind.  Now, uh, uh, mullet man's mom.  Hello?  Yeah.  Um, I'm sure you were very, very distraught when the police came to the house and told you 
[01:04:30]  that, uh, he was dead, right?  Oh, he was dead.  What did that sound like?  Please recreate entirely and at full volume what it sounded like when you were informed  of your son mullet man's death.  Go.  Uh, yes.  This is the NYPD.  We got terrible news.  What is it?  Uh, your son just died in an explosion.  Oh, no. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I only told him to take him a package that he was excited about getting.  I finally told him that he said it.  He's a med jacket he always wanted.  Med jacket.  I, uh, my son just died in an exciting package.  I'm an idiot.  Oh, poor idiot.  Well, you gotta be louder and you're upset. 
[01:05:30]  You gotta cry and scream like, oh, my baby, oh.  Be a bad idiot.  Like they're running into the terrorist country.  I'll beat him up like an MMA guy  I'll beat him up like an MMA guy  I'll beat him up like an MMA guy  I don't think I like this character  I don't think I'm digging this character 
[01:06:00]  It's too quiet  It's too quiet, I can't hear it  I can't hear it either, people are complaining  People are on the radio and they want to hear a loud person  How about this?  You know how all the car salesmen have those commercials  Where they're very boisterous about the cars  They're having a lot for sale  What if  $500!  Exactly  What if Daniel Curlin, the gay abused car salesman  Did a commercial right here 
[01:06:30]  That would be good  Daniel Curlin, the gay car salesman  Gay abused car salesman  Sell us a car, make it like it's a commercial  Wait, wait, wait, I should remember something  Yeah, yeah  Because the angle with the car salesman  Was that he was trying to always sell you a real piece of shit car  But pretending like it was the best deal ever  Oh, now that's the angle  And if you were a guy, he would flirt a little bit  Oh, what an angle he's got 
[01:07:00]  Okay  Now  Check out this fabulous car  It's got massive stereos  Keep going, keep going  How many stereos?

What are you talking about?  Yeah.  Get the hell in your room.  Stop.  Stop.  Now.  You need to say, I'm on the phone, bitch.  I'm on the phone, bitch. 
[01:33:30]  But yeah, you got my name information, right?  For what?  For what?  I mean, if I could see Jimmy at Foxwoods.  Yes, well, you can have a ticket, Daniel.  Of course.  Yeah, we'll figure it out, though.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  You guys have a great weekend, and happy birthday, Anthony.  Oh, thanks, man.  You probably met yesterday.  I misread the date you said your birthday.  I was trying to remember.  I got a reminder. 
[01:34:00]  I got so many birthdays, I got to remember in April.  You're falling apart here.  All right.  You're unraveling.  You did good.  Good job.  Don't blow it.  All right, Bobo.  Great job.  Don't start wishing everybody a happy birthday.  Leave on the high note.  Exactly.  Bobo and the one-man band.  There you go.  Excellent job.  I love Bobo.  How do you not love Bobo?  Jesus.  Daniel, get to bed.  The mother's just like, oh, what is he doing again?  That was very Rupert Pupkin.  That was awesome.  I got to do this now. 
[01:34:30]  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2011 so far continues on the virus.  Sam Rich Voss is in studio.  And you know, when Rich travels around the country doing stand-up gigs, he likes to also golf.  But he doesn't want to be disrupted on the golf course.  No, so he likes to tell people that he's something he's not.  They say, Rich, Voss, we see your name on your name tag, but what do you do for a living?  And instead of saying I'm a comic, he says, I'm an FBI profiler.  Now, if you didn't want people to know who you were, why you would pick an interesting career to tell them, I do not know. 
[01:35:00]  What do you tell people when you're out and about when they ask what you do for a living?  They know damn well who I am when I'm out and about.  I don't even have the chance to lie.  Oh.  Facial recognition.  Sucks to be you.  Eh.  What am I going to do?  Complain?  It's Rich Voss, the FBI profiler on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2011 so far.  I just got back from San Francisco area.  Yeah.  I played the San Francisco Golf Club and the Cal Club.  I don't know what that means.  People out there would know. 
[01:35:30]  No, we don't know.  What's that mean?  Good places.  What's it mean?  They have a room, you know, they have the room where you drink and eat and stuff.  Women aren't allowed in it.  That's a great place.  Why would you want to hang out with women?  You're so right.  You're so right.  Why have women around?  If you know women aren't allowed in it, you know who else isn't allowed in it.  You know what I'm saying?  That's true.  Yeah.  Women are icky, right?  It was great, man.  That's why a part of me hates, likes the fact that they don't have women, though, because 
[01:36:00]  women do fuck up your fun, and these guys like to get hookers and stuff, and the broads  are just ruined it.  I got to agree with Rich.  I mean, nothing worse than being behind a foursome, a broads.  Oh, broads, or Japanese.  Where they're 100 yards out, and they're pulling out a, will this make sense to anyone, a five  wood.  They're the fucking one.  I played with two ladies yesterday, and they were older, but they were so hot.  They had such nice tits and asses.  I couldn't concentrate.  Like, the front nine I played by myself, and I shot like 42, and then the back nine, I 
[01:36:30]  couldn't stop staring at this late, their tits and their asses as they were bending over  to putt, I almost started jerking off on the fucking green.  I was so fucking...  I'm just thinking of these old ladies how fucking dry their fucking snatches are, but  how fucking fun it would be if I could get in.  You know?  Oh, God.  How old were you?  I mean, how old were they?  Excuse me, sorry.  I don't know, probably 55, 56.  Ew.  So they're your age.  Huh?  They're your age. 
[01:37:00]  A little older, but the one was probably in her 40s, but their just tits were so perfect,  and I don't even give a fuck about tits.  What a waste of time they are.  Tits are fucking...  How old do you play golfers?  Three, four times.  A lot.  I mean, I play a lot.  It's his thing.  Three, four times a week?  Yeah.  What time do you wake up to play?  Uh, it depends.  Sometimes five, sometimes six, sometimes seven.  It depends.  You get up that early every day just because you want to get up?  It's great to be on a golf course.  I want to get the fuck out of the house before she gets up. 
[01:37:30]  But it's fun.  It depends.  You don't mind the road.  Do you like it early at tea time or no?  Yeah, because I get to play quick, and I don't want to be stuck behind every fucking  horrible golfer on the planet.  And, you know...  You play with strangers usually?  Yeah.  Always.  It's the fucking worst on the road, Locust.  In Leicester, like this...  When I was in here last time, this guy called, and he got me on a course that was unbelievable.  I mean, I played in Atlanta, TPC, Sugarloaf.  I play the best courses in the country because I go on radio.  I call the course.  I go, look, I'll be on radio tomorrow.  I'll plug you guys, right? 
[01:38:00]  And I fucking get on the best courses, and I wear my golf...  That's how I get free golf clothes because I'll wear them into the studio, and they'll  start talking about the pants, so I plug in them.  This is plug-ola.  You could go to jail for this.  No, I can't.  I can't.  I'm not a fucking...  That's true.  He's not paid.  I'm not paid.  You're lucky.  So, on the road, what else am I going to do all day?  Should I go play golf?  You know, I fucking sit in the hotel.  I chip balls into the curtain.  What's that night?  I chip balls.  I'm sorry.  I hit balls into the curtain in the hotel room. 
[01:38:30]  Sometimes I miss, and you hear bangs on the wall.  You really?  Yeah, I'm bored.  What am I going to do on the fucking road?  A lot of people write jokes.  I write on stage.  I can't, you know, unless I'm doing one of those...  Don't you be writing while you're playing golf all of a sudden to think of something and  go, oh, and then write it down?  Why not?  Sometimes.  I mean, you know, I'm not like that as a comic.  If I come up with it...  So, do you have to sit there in a room with a piece of paper and a pen and just wait for  the jokes to come?  No, I never did.  When you do a show like Red Eye or Joey Behar or Tough Crowd, that's when you come up 
[01:39:00]  with some shit.  It's funny because they give you the topics and you write about them.  That's when it's fun.  Right.  You know, but I'm playing golf with guys and you can't tell them you're a comic.  They fucking...  It's the worst.  So, I usually tell...  They start telling you jokes?  Oh, it's fucking hard.  Although, one guy told me a good joke last week.  He goes, this guy comes home and says to his wife, tell me someday it's going to make  me happy and mad.  And she goes, well, you got a bigger dick than your brothers.  That was the joke.  It wasn't bad.  But I tell them I'm an FBI profiler and I get more questions and I just lie my way 
[01:39:30]  through the fucking round.  I'm sad for Rich.  Why?  You're living the...  You want to see what it's like to be like that guy.  What are you doing?  Well, I don't want to tell them I'm a comic.  I'm an FBI profiler.  What am I going to say?  I'm a house painter?  That's boring.  Exactly.  That's the point.  You don't want to talk to them.  You don't tell them you have a fascinating job.  Yeah, because then you're going to be caught up in lies. 
[01:40:00]  I'm an astronaut.  Right.  I was on the last space shuttle mission.  You always come up with...  I always say marketing because who the fuck wants to talk about marketing?  Right.  Why?  You could say Opie and Anthony.  I don't feel like talking about Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  I fucking should have went with it.  I'm sorry, Rich.  Touche.  Fucking touche.  And I'm fucking going to explain why.  What an idiot.  Good job.  I've said advertising before.  You do, right?  Because I don't want to...  No one believes it.  As soon as you say marketing, they don't go, oh, really? 
[01:40:30]  Could you tell me, you know, for who...  They don't give a fuck at that point.  Yeah, but I like fucking lying to them all day about the profiler.  But seriously, you're an FBI profiler.  Yeah.  And what do they say?  They probably wonder, like, how could he...  His vocabulary is so bad.  How could he be a profiler?  Jesus Christ.  Well, they're not the brainiacs on the book.  They're not.  Obviously, you're not.  So what kind of questions did they ask you?  Yeah, I told him I worked on the, what do you call it, Seattle, the Green River, what  was it called?  I don't know. 
[01:41:00]  I worked on that.  I told him I worked on the...  Wait a minute.  You say it's the Green...  I don't even know who the guy is that you worked on.  He even goes for high-profile cases.  Yeah, I told him I worked on the Green Apple Killer.  I told him I worked on the Atlanta, the Atlanta, uh, Seattle Killers.  That was 81!  Oh, yeah, you're all...  Yeah.  He's fucked...  You're fucked up.  You are fucked up!  You're fucked up.  You might have multiple personalities or something.  He doesn't even have one!  That's too twisted.  You're a liar!  That's too twisted.  You're an FBI profiler, and you're working on high-profile cases? 
[01:41:30]  That's fucking weird, dude.  I don't do it all the time.  Sometimes I say something.  The fact that you've done it once...  Do you get caught up in your lies, though?  Because you don't have enough info on the Green River Killer.  I give them enough...  What do you know on the Green River...  Is it the Green River Killer, Jimmy?  Yeah.  What do you know on that?  It was in Seattle.  Let's make believe you're talking to us.  Wow, you're an FBI profiler.  It was in Seattle, and then, you know, when we were profiling, uh, from the, uh, remains...  Well, then I go, look, I can't talk a lot about it, but it was very...  Even though books were written about us, why can't you? 
[01:42:00]  It was really intense.  What?  We had to profile for the evidence?  It was really intense?  What an idiot who offers nothing?  Are you losing your mind?  Yes.  You are, right?  You're losing a little bit, huh?  I'm an FBI profiler.  The Green River, whatever it was.  He never disappoints, this fucking guy.  Wow.  Whatever.  No, I want to hear more about that.  What does your job entail? 
[01:42:30]  Well, they asked me where I work out of.  One guy said, where do you work out of?  I go, in Newark.  I work out of the federal building in Newark.  And I knew it was in Newark.  He goes, where?  I go on Division Street, I guessed.  So, obviously, I was right.  It was in that area.  Now, we're doing mainly a lot on, uh, on, you know, terrorists and terrorist-type threats  and stuff like that.  But, you know, back in the day, it was more murders.  And just, you know, when we worked on the Atlanta case...  What was the guy's name? 
[01:43:00]  Who was the child killer in Atlanta?  Child killer?  Some black dude.  Now, what was his name, though?  Well, this is a question that someone could ask.  Oh, oh, oh, Kyle Grooms.  No, and the FBI were the ones who actually, uh...  The police thought in Atlanta that it was a black, uh, that it was white supremacist and  Klan who were doing it.  How did you guys know that it was a black killer?  Well, this is how we knew it.  We, uh, the killer would call.  We would talk to the killer. 
[01:43:30]  And, uh, the killer said there was a body on...  Say the killer again.  The killer said there was a body on, on, on Martin Luther King Boulevard or whatever.  So we went there and we had, obviously, lookouts and, uh, we went to dig up the...  Lookouts.  We had lookouts.  We had, you know, uh, FBI.  We had, uh, a lot of, uh, G-men.  And, uh, we were digging up the road.  We dug up the side of the road and we dug up the...  We dug up the wrong...  Hold on. 
[01:44:00]  You don't do this.  We dug up the wrong side of the road on purpose.  No, stop him for a second.  You don't do...  You don't do this.  What do you mean?  I'm getting really uncomfortable.  I don't do this.  You don't do this.  I don't get this much in detail.  You brought this bit to the show today.  I appreciate it.  No, I know.  You're actually an FBI profiler on the road.  Sometime.  Oh, my God.  I didn't say it was a good one.  I'm so uncomfortable.  But you're terrible.  Do people just walk away from you?  Well, when I bite my arm.  You bite your arm when you miss? 
[01:44:30]  Yes.  When it...  What happens to me?  He bites his arm when he misses in front of other people.  What the fuck?  Wait.  Have you ever bitten your arm after telling someone you're a profiler?  Bro, this guy's an asshole.  Who does he catch?  I'm fucking drooling. 
[01:45:00]  What a fucking jerk.  You're like...  Wait.  So you'll actually...  You've bitten your arm angrily?  Where do you bite it?  Here?  Here.  If you ever get frustrated or mad, just fucking bite it until it hurts.  It takes away all the frustration.  So you bite it, and what do they do?  They don't want to ask him about the profiling shit anymore.  I fucking bite...  I used to.  Between my bicep and my shoulder was my spot. 
[01:45:30]  I go like this and bite really hard.  When you're frustrated or...  Yeah, I don't do it anymore.  I don't know why.  I guess I'm more chill.  I don't know what the fuck is.  You can't get your arm to your mouth.  Remember James Caan?  I don't know why.  Like that.  So in the middle of telling them you're an FBI profiler, you bite your arm real...  It depends how bad the shot is.  And then they don't want to talk to you anymore.  The green guy, river guy, who was...  You don't even know the Atlantic child killer.  He's one of the most famous serial killers ever.  What was his name again?  Wayne Williams.  Oh, Wayne, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  So why...  Oh, Wayne, of course.  So why wouldn't you Google some of this before you tell all your lies?  So you're up on your info.  How did they get him to explode on the stand?  Um, what happened?  Poof.  They started...  They brought up his mom.  And his childhood.  They brought up his childhood.  And, uh...  How did they...  But I was right about how they dug up the wrong side of the road.  Yeah, you were.  But just the way you said it was the way...  The lookouts.  They had lookouts. 
[01:46:30]  We have lookouts.  FBI.  Profile.  Road.  He just keeps saying profile, profiler.  Other profilers.  I don't do it all the time.  The fact that you've ever even thought about doing it once is humiliating.  Yeah, if you do it once, it's too many times.  Well, you never lied.  You say you're in marketing.  But that's where it ends.  But not...  You want to keep talking.  Yeah, because I know they'll never ask a follow-up question.  What if they do?  I swear to you, I don't think they ever have.  Because no one that they see...  Unfortunately, because when you're...  You have to write where you work. 
[01:47:00]  Uh-huh.  Because you can't fuck up, you know, paperwork.  So I write SiriusX.  I'm like, oh, what do you do for them?  I'm like, oh, fuck.  Ah, marketing.  And I say it like that, ah, marketing.  And it ends the conversation.  They don't want to hear about marketing.  They want to hear about, you know, some of these radio shows.  Not a marketing guy.  And then you don't have to talk to them about that crap.  Then you can talk to them about whatever you want to talk to them about.  Well, fucking yesterday I played in some...  Like, I played a front by myself and a back and I joined the two ladies and this guy, he 
[01:47:30]  knew I was a comic.  Hey, where you working?  Ah, fucking leave me alone.  Then two holes later, hey ladies, did he tell you what he does?  And it's just so fucking aggro.  And there's some...  Jay Moore has entered the studio.  I think she had a stroke.  I ran down the hallway because I heard Mushmouth was here.  I was like, oh my God.  It's the first time you exercise this month.  It's true.  Wow.  He attacked me.  He attacked back.  How about you shut up before I get rolling in here to kick your ass again?  Oh, remember that?  You weren't even here.  I was here.  No.  No, he heard about it.  I'm always here, bro. 
[01:48:00]  I missed you, Rich.  I missed you.  I ran down the halls.  I swear.  I ran down the hall and they go, oh, Rich Boss is in there.  And you lost a little muscle mass yourself with your little front porch you got going.  What are you talking about?  That's true, right?  Wait a little bit.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  All right.  Old man abs.  With some underpants on.  I got fucking Iggy Pop abs.  That's far off.  After I saw him without his shirt on, I want to stop working out. 
[01:48:30]  Fucking horrible.  He looks like he looked into the arc.  Did you see him?  Too many words.  You missed the hour before you got here, Jay.  It's very depressing.  No.  Ask him what he does on the road.  It's not depressing.  Ask him what he does on the road besides play golf.  I have the elephant man's head.  Who gives a fuck about his finances?  No.  I obviously need a doctor.  I'm John Merrick.  You talk like the fucking guy.  So we can sleep in a fucking chair.  There's a difference.  I don't have to talk. 
[01:49:00]  We still have to look at you.  Here's the difference.  You do have to talk, Rich.  It's your fucking job.  That's your whole fucking line.  You have to talk.  There's only 80 people there.  They don't care.  You look at a guy hitting zero that just bats fucking lead off every night.  He's due.  I'm due.  I never fail on stage.  Never.  Tell Jay Moore what you do on the road besides play golf because it's deeply depressing and  we got to hear it again.  What do I do?  He makes believe.  Ready for this?  Oh, what do I do?  That he's an FBI profiler.  They say, what do you do for a living?  I'm a golf course because you don't want to talk about comedy. 
[01:49:30]  No, but he wants to talk about being an FBI profiler.  Right.  He's living out this fantasy of just being a smart guy.  Very smart.  And then we asked him basic shit and he didn't know the names of the serial killers that he  was profiling.  But here's the thing.  The public doesn't know those questions that you know.  He probably dropped the guy in Long Island off.  He had no idea it was him.  There's a serial killer.  Yeah, I know.  They just found Body 10.  Did they?  Oh, let's hear a little bit about it. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, you're the FBI profiler.  They went past their perimeter and they're outside their perimeter and they went farther.  Who's they?  First of all, it's called his comfort zone.  It's not called a perimeter.  No, the perimeter where the bodies were found.  You need the lingo.  The comfort zone.  The comfort zone is where he kills or his comfort for killing.  And they went outside his comfort zone.  No, no.  They went outside the perimeter of where the bodies were found, the other eight bodies.  That's the comfort zone.  Which would be the fucking comfort zone.  The comfort zone is where he is killing in his comfort zone. 
[01:50:30]  When did you give that shirt back to a black act?  I would, but I don't know his real name.  It's a rugby shirt.  J.B.  Smooth.  Smooth.  Ruckus.  And tell him about the lookouts.  What?  He's got lookouts.  The minor league team?  The Chattanooga lookouts?  He's got lookouts.  So, anyhow, let's get back to wise guys.  No, when he's in the FBI, you've got lookouts.  Yeah, you've got lookouts.  You want to call someone from the FBI?  You got one?  Tell me about the lookouts. 
[01:51:00]  Well, when we were digging up the fake bodies in Atlanta, we had lookouts to see who was in the crowd.  And if there was any white people.  And there was no white people.  So, we knew that the serial killer wasn't white.  That's all.  You know, it's hard to explain serial killers.  The serial killers are normally white, yeah.  I know, but this one was black in Atlanta.  There's a lot more black ones than you'd think, though.  They're fucking white girls. 
[01:51:30]  They're just killing their own race.  What did you say, Rich?  Nothing.  This is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2011 so far.  Sam, we're continuing on with this stupid physical fitness challenge that the company sold and we were forced to do.  But the contestants are myself, you, and Bobo.  Well, the gauntlet was thrown down and I came to compete.  Yeah, you did come to compete.  Yeah.  Your outfit was definitely unique and you were ready to play.  But this starts all the events that we had to compete in. 
[01:52:00]  Well, it was push-ups.  It was sit-ups.  It was dips.  It was running.  It was the whole thing.  It was retarded.  Well, that's Bobo.  And it all starts right now.  Damn, I took the R-word pledge.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2011 so far.  Blazing your eyeball.  That's cheating.  All right, Travis, what do we got?  You want to have Sam go first?  I like to see Sam because he seems to be the most fit.  Sam's very confident.  Do we have a stopwatch?  Yeah, I got one right here.  Here goes Sam.  Now, how long does Sam have? 
[01:52:30]  He has 20 minutes on right now.  20 minutes?  How long is this going to take?  I know.  Two.  Three.  Four.  Five.  Six.  Seven.  God damn it.  Eight.  Nine.  Ten.  One.  Two.  Fuck.  Three.  Four.  Five.  He's getting weak.  Six.  He's getting weak.  Seven.  Don't listen to him.  Eight.  Nine.  Push it out. 
[01:53:00]  Twenty.  Push it out.  That's it.  And how many seconds?  27 seconds.  God damn it, Ant.  Here's your 200 hours.  20 and 27 seconds.  Have fun at the Poconos Raceway, you other two.  You can buy your own tickets.  Nice, Sam.  God damn.  Twenty how many seconds?  Twenty-seven.  Fucking E-Rock was planking for a minute at a time when he was working on it.  E-Rock's a stronger guy.  All right.  Twenty and twenty-  Are you ready for the Sex Bagel?  Yeah.  Sex Bagel?  The Sex Bagel.  Eric?  Twenty and twenty-seven seconds. 
[01:53:30]  Hold on, motherfucker.  I'm going to my stopwatch.  I don't want to take-  You think we have different iPhones?  I don't want to take your word for it.  And stopwatch.  Reset.  Okay.  On the count of three.  What?  Well, we've got to wait until he, you know, starts, I guess.  Oh, I was waiting.  Hey, man.  Tell me when.  All right.  One.  It's not a straight line.  Oh, no.  He's doing it.  Two.  Three.  Oh, God.  Faster, E-Rock, please.  Five.  He's fine.  Six.  You have to be twenty-seven seconds. 
[01:54:00]  Faster.  Faster.  Nine.  Come on.  Ten.  One.  Easily.  Two.  Three.  Four.  He's not going down.  Five.  Yeah, yeah, he's fine.  Six.  Seven.  Keep going.  Eight.  Eight.  Nine.  One more.  Twenty.  That's it.  There you go.  E-Rock, you're turning too red.  You're going to breathe.  I had twenty-one seconds.  I had twenty.  Three.  Twenty-three?  I had twenty.  But you started yours late.  Yeah, see, that's all wrong.  Twenty-three seconds.  Sorry, Sam.  He went...  Jesus Christ.  It helps to have a baggy shirt that hits the ground. 
[01:54:30]  He really wasn't going down as far as you are.  He wasn't going nearly as close as I was going.  Wait, E-Rock just beat Sam?  No.  That's correct.  Killed him.  I mean, if we're going to fix the competition, we can fix it.  I've been going first to hurt you.  Well, yeah, but I mean...  Killed him.  It also hurt me that I went down way closer than E-Rock.  Hey, it's only the first event, Sam.  Well, I should have won that already.  You've lost the first event to E-Rock.  My two hundred dollars is safe for now.  Well, we still have Bobo.  Damn it.  Really?  Bobo.  But this is my point now, Bobo.  Let me tell you, this is for everybody who doesn't have transportation to and from Pocono 
[01:55:00]  Raceway.  Okay.  Like you?  Yeah, unfortunately.  Public transportation can't get me to and from Pocono Raceway.  Let me ask you a question.  What a subtle way of trying to get tickets.  Why would you tell anybody that?  Because that's it.  You have big, juicy, dick-sucking lips.  That's the honest truth, all right?  Yes, it is.  All right, what does that mean, though?  You don't even know what it means.  It's uninteresting to anyone at all.  For all the people like him. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, well, there are people that this is a big thing that sometimes get into the track.  Because he wanted us to know he doesn't have the transportation either.  Yes.  I don't like your fat shoes.  So if we were to give him any trip there, he also needs transportation.  See, he's pretty clever.  So now he's looking for a ride.  Right.  All right.  He's looking for tickets and a ride.  Come on, Bobo.  Let's see how...  Bobo, you ready?  Hold on, Bobo.  What are you doing?  Don't start yet.  Don't start yet.  Don't start yet.  Oh, my God.  And Mars...  Go.  All right, ready? 
[01:56:00]  Go.  What is that?  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Three.  No, it's not official.  Go down lower on your arms.  He hasn't counted one yet.  Mars is the judge.  Come on.  He did three.  Wait, wait.  Is this slow enough?  No, you got to straighten your back out.  Oh, my God.  And then...  Oh, my God.  Four.  He's an E-Roc push-up.  Five.  Mars hasn't even given him one yet.  Six.  You know, seven.  He's officially lost.  Eight.  Nine.  Ten.  He's doing the worm.  Twelve. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  Let it be.  Oh, whatever.  He's already up to 32 seconds anyway.  Oh, my God.  Mars, did he do one official push-up?  He did not do one push-up.  Yeah.  Bobo, what do you think?  What?  You get an N-T.  No time.  What happened?  The push-ups was going to be a difficult one, I knew.  Why?  You knew?  So you weren't really training for that one?  No, I was training for it, but I knew it would be difficult.  How were you training for it?  How were you training?  Yeah.  I was trying to do it, but it just kept getting difficult doing it. 
[01:57:00]  How were you training?  I kept trying to do push-ups, and I assumed that I was doing it the right way.  Really?  How I was doing it before.  Yeah.  You're just putting your cock on the floor and then pushing your shoulders up?  Yeah.  Pushing your cock into the carpet is not a push-up.  Exactly.  I knew I had to rely on the other parts of the competition.  Oh.  You're not going to win those.  Which are what?  No, no, no.  I'm going to win those.  You have to go with your strengths.  Yeah.  With your strengths.  With your strengths.  Right?  Those are my strengths, all right?  You may have won the battle, but you haven't won the war. 
[01:57:30]  Shut up.  All right, listen.  Jesus.  Let me go to Jeremy.  Jeremy.  Yeah.  Bobo's representing you, and you're in Dead Last.  Well, at least he does push-ups as good as he spells in his tweets.  Is he a bad spell?  Are you a bad speller?  A little bit.  A little bit.  That was Daniel saying.  Yeah, I am, bud.  And then in a surprise move, we go to Ron.  Ron, E-Rock won the sit-up competition.  How are you feeling so far? 
[01:58:00]  The push-up.  Sorry, sorry.  I feel pretty good.  All right.  Feeling confident?  Feel confident.  I know he can do it.  Okay.  And then we're going to go to David for a word here, who was disappointed by Sam.  David.  David.  Yeah.  Still confident, though.  Still confident.  I love the enthusiasm, and he seems pumped and ready to do it.  Sam, what happened?  You just...  I think Sam was doing legitimate push-ups.  E-Rock wasn't going down all the way.  I didn't realize we were doing, like, girl push-ups. 
[01:58:30]  Otherwise, I would have done 40 of them.  Yeah, I didn't see E-Rock going down all the way.  Yeah, I did 20 better push-ups.  Did it hurt you going first, though?  Because you didn't go fast enough.  It hurt me that I did real push-ups.  You could have gone faster, Sam.  Mars, did E-Rock do real push-ups?  Sam was all laxanated.  You could have gone faster, knowing it's a timed event.  They were good.  I think Sam thought he was going to be able to do that many push-ups, and then that was it.  And E-Rock wasn't even going to be able to complete it.  Maybe underestimating Eric.  I think he's underestimating E-Rock in that.  I thought we were going to do real push-ups. 
[01:59:00]  That's what I meant, too.  Yes, yes, yes.  Like, I thought we were actually competing, not, like, just playing games.  Right.  Right.  You know?  What's the next competition?  Sit-ups.  We'll go right into sit-ups.  Yeah, maybe the winner of our last competition should start off sit-ups.  Good call.  Exactly.  All right, let's do that.  I think E-Rock.  So, once again, 20 sit-ups.  E-Rock first.  Mars, you're going to demonstrate a hand.  Yes, I can, but you need someone to hold feet.  Then hold their feet.  Yeah, I'll hold their feet, right?  All right, fine.  Let someone hold your feet with your brand-new shoes. 
[01:59:30]  So, we start, you know, with your back on the ground, heads over your head.  Heads over your head.  Hands over your head.  And come up all the way straight line.  All the way.  And then back there.  All the way.  Elbows on the knees.  Your head does not have to touch the floor, but the back does.  Right, your back.  Your shoulder blades, whatever the fuck.  So, Mars is winded after two.  That's good.  Now, earlier, like I said, it's not Mars 2006.  Uh-oh, what do we got somewhere?  Earlier, Bobo told Sam and I that he could do a thousand sit-ups. 
[02:00:00]  A thousand sit-ups.  And that his cousin has seen him do a thousand sit-ups.  Your cousin has seen you do a thousand sit-ups.  Wow, that's...  He has seen me, not...  He had to tell me to stop.  I don't know if I reached a thousand, but...  They abuse him at home, don't they?  Wow.  I was doing a lot of sit-ups, and he told me, he says,  Stop, I see you can do sit-ups, he said.  He told him there were sit-ups.  I think he had his penis by young Daniel's mouth.  He was holding his feet.  And holding his head.  And then having his head come up to his dick.  Yeah.  One.  They're very funny.  I was actually doing an actual sit-up. 
[02:00:30]  I don't think you want to say that, Timuray.  My cousin is a very muscular guy.  He's a verbal drunk driver.  Once again, Bobo has to go last,  because there's a 20-minute time limit officially with lawyers,  and that could just shut down the whole fucking thing.  All right, so I think we should do Sammy Rock.  You have to give them proper rest time.  No, no, I'm not going first again.  No, Eric's going first.  You can't give me, Rock.  Eric has to go first.  Do you want to go first, York?  Yes.  Oh, ooh.  All right, Eric.  Fucking Cavs McGillicuddy.  First.  Eric Rock is taking his position on the floor. 
[02:01:00]  There it is.  I'll never get up.  Laying down.  Yeah, straddled out.  Oh, man.  He's making fun of Mars.  Ready and go.  One.  And he's finished.  Two.  Two.  Breathe, Eric.  Breathe.  Breathe, Eric.  Don't hold your breath.  Five.  Five.  Pick up the pace if you can, Eric.  Seven.  He's doing well.  He's doing real well.  Eight.  An animal.  Nine.  Ten.  One.  Two.  Three. 
[02:01:30]  Faster, Eric.  Faster, faster.  Body of a hippo, but I have a tiger.  Six.  Seven.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Nine.  Nineteen.  Ten.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  I got 31 seconds.  I got 31, too.  I have 15.  31 seconds for E-Rock.  31 seconds for E-Rock.  Eric's depressing me.  I had to put a tax under it.  Wow, here it is.  Sam coming out now, putting his yoga mat down.  Jesus.  This purple yoga mat that I'm sure his mommy bought him. 
[02:02:00]  Of course she did.  She probably made it for him.  Sam, will you be dissecting this whole thing in the shit hour today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Nice dirty yoga mat.  Jesus.  What?  It's the bottom of the yoga mat.  What is that?  Keep the fucking oil off the rug in the garage?  I've been reminded that Bobo did bet that if he loses his competition, he's off the show.  That's right.  That's right.  Okay.  Oh, Bobo.  There's a lot at stake.  So, Bobo, there's a lot at stake here.  And you've already lost the first part of the competition.  Well, I knew the push-ups was going to be the week.  Right.  It's not a microphone. 
[02:02:30]  It's a video camera.  You're an idiot.  For the audience at home, he leaned into a video camera.  He was holding a video camera.  He was talking into the lens of a video camera.  He just leaned into a video camera.  You're not on TMZ, you zilch.  I've got to see that footage now.  All you're going to see is a big mouth.  I knew the push-ups was going to be a difficult part.  We know.  This is going to be the sixth time he's banned from the show in.  Exactly.  I'm trying to keep track.  I believe it's six or seven times.  This will be the sixth or seven times.  Tired of your arm hair.  Sam is in position for the sit-ups. 
[02:03:00]  And if we could give a little count.  Ready?  I'm going to take pictures of Sam's pants.  Go.  One.  Uh-oh.  Two.  Oh, no.  He's fucking skinny.  Three.  Four.  Come on, Sam.  Pick it up.  Fast.  Five.  Oh, he's hitting hard.  Oh, he sucks.  Oh, he's hitting hard.  Oh, he blew the competition.  Oh, no.  What is it?  Seven.  He threw it down. 
[02:03:30]  He did seven sit-ups.  Six.  Six point five.  Yeah, he did six.  He did six in 16 seconds.  What happened, Sam?  I wouldn't have done 20 in time.  So why use your energy now?  No, you were falling back heavy, man.  So why use your energy now?  I could have done 20.  Oh, you're saving up.  Right.  Because why use my energy in this?  I don't think you could do 20.  No, he can't.  I can't believe I got even E-Rock 200 bucks by proxy.  Attaboy, E-Rock.  I knew to pick this fucking kid.  Oh, hang on.  Because we still have Bobo.  Yeah.  Oh, Bobo. 
[02:04:00]  Bobo.  It's really funny if he was a sit-up phenom and did, like, 502 minutes.  Big dumb babbling lips.  Just doing good.  Hey, Bobo, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, yeah.  Bobo just got yelled at by laying on Sam's yoga mat.  Yes.  That useless yoga mat.  It really is worthless.  Hold on.  You might as well use that.  What was in that fucking yoga mat?  He probably put it in the pacifist so he doesn't do sit-ups.  Yes.  You might as well use it as a welcome mat for your apartment.  I know.  It's useless.  Jesus Christ.  I've never seen a weakling. 
[02:04:30]  I hope you really come around at the end here.  I want to kick Sam in his face on the beach.  All right.  Sorry.  Okay.  Ready and go.  Bobo.  One.  One.  Two.  Fast.  Now, you've got to come up further.  Higher.  Four.  There you go.  Higher.  Fast.  Five.  You have this.  You have this.  Six.  Come on, Bobo.  Seven.  Eight.  Breathe, Bobo.  Nine.  Slow it out.  Oh, his bed breath just got Mars as he can.  I'm going to breathe.  Breathe, Bobo.  Breathe.  You've got to breathe. 
[02:05:00]  Blow it out.  Blow it out.  Mars is not happy.  Blow it out.  Quick.  Eight.  Blow it out.  Faster.  19.  One more, one more, one more.  20.  Oh, come on.  He might have did it.  I got 29.  I got 30 seconds.  30 seconds.  I got 37.  Bobo just won the sit-up competition.  Oh, my God.  Bobo has won.  Yes.  Bobo just won the sit-up.  Bobo has won.  Bobo has won one competition.  He has won the sit-up competition.  Was it bad, Mark?  That's bad.  I knew this one. 
[02:05:30]  I would win this one.  All right.  I knew this one again.  There was no question on this one.  That's like, that is going to go down in, like, sport, quote, history.  I knew this one.  I was going to win this one.  Exactly.  Wow.  I came from Ohio with a chewed-up dick and an extra chromosome with the dream of destroying  a radio show and talking over everybody.  I'm glad I could make that treat big.  It's true.  It's true. 
[02:06:00]  If we could go to the scoreboard, as we see with push-ups, we have our own E-Rock is the  champion.  Yeah.  With sit-ups, Bobo is the champion.  By one second.  By one second.  Amazing.  And, of course, our own Sam Roberts, who you can catch here at 10 on the shit show.  Nothing.  Zero.  Zilch.  The shit hour.  You've got to win the next competition or you're out.  I'm competing in all four regardless.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  What a...  Ooh, good.  Bravery and courage.  What are you, the fucking cripple that does the marathon? 
[02:06:30]  No, he's not even that good.  What's the next event?  We'll do dips.  I need you to win here.  You're throwing this.  What are you doing?  Hold on, Bobo.  Is there time to bet yet?  God, Bobo, you don't just start.  You've got to wait until we start you.  All right.  What about the 20-minute fucking time limit?  Ready, Bobo?  Oh, shit.  And go.  What are you doing?  You're swinging.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  He's the no-dip-doing kid.  Hey, Bobo.  Is there one? 
[02:07:00]  No, that's not the dip.  He's lifting his legs up in the air.  You haven't done one yet.  Yeah, you haven't not done one dip.  Four.  No, Bobo, just use your arms and lift yourself up.  One.  Just no all the way.  Not your legs.  He can't even keep himself.  Lift your legs off the floor.  Up, now down.  Not all the way.  Now up on the floor again.  Those are hard to do, man.  And he's losing his glasses.  Oh, that's it.  You got...  Okay.  I've never done dips before.  Yeah.  Maybe you should put them a little closer.  You did good.  I've never done this before.  You did good.  Bobo, you did good. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, you did good.  Don't worry.  You did good.  Don't worry about that.  I think you might have won that.  All right.  You did none in 33 seconds.  How many dips is that, Bobo?  I don't care.  Let's move on to the next case.  I say none.  Yeah.  That was good.  You did not do one correct dippage.  Dipless in Seattle.  Who's up next?  This is odd.  Who's up?  Sam.  Me?  Sam, you are up.  Sam, 20 dips.  Sam, take your position.  Ready.  Oh, you got position.  Ready. 
[02:08:00]  You move even closer.  That's easier for you.  It is.  Whatever.  The number to beat is zero.  Okay.  Yes.  Zero.  Ready.  Set.  Go.  Go.  All right.  There's one, two.  Wait, wait.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He did two.  He did not either.  He swung back and forth.  Oh, Sam was talking a really good game the last few days.  You know, this fucking guy should know this hyping motherfucker.  He can't do shit. 
[02:08:30]  Can we talk to Sam for a second?  Troy is yelling.  Wait.  Where's Troy?  Holy mackerel.  Sam.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, I did two.  Yeah.  It was a weird two, though, sir.  You're surprised why?  That wasn't even a real two.  I don't even know if that was a good two.  Troy.  You're giving up.  You got to fucking be kidding me.  What are you doing?  I still got another event.  Dude.  Everyone believed you're hype, and now everyone's mad at you.  Holy shit.  Look at Troy.  I don't believe it.  His face is red.  Troy, what's wrong?  What's wrong? 
[02:09:00]  You got to fucking be kidding me.  I know.  He's done two dips, and how many sit-ups?  Seven.  I think he did seven sit-ups.  The push-ups were good.  Six.  No, they were in.  You lost that.  He did six or seven sit-ups and two dips.  He's like, I've been training.  That fat motherfucker doesn't know what he has coming to him.  Yeah, $200.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking asshole.  I get 50 for Norton.  Oh, yeah, I get 50 from Troy.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no.  How we bet on this fucking guy, listening to his hype, his bullshit, his wrestling work. 
[02:09:30]  Here's what it is.  Eric's not going to get more than two, and then I'm going to beat him running, so that  would be me.  I'm the champion.  Right there.  Yes, because that would be a tie.  No, it would be two points for me, because he's not going to win this event.  No, here's the real...  And I will win this if he doesn't get two.  Here's the real deal.  I won this one.  He's not going to get two.  Hold on.  If E-Rock does three dips, he wins the whole fucking thing.  We don't even have...  No, Bobo.  Bobo could tie him.  Bobo could tie him.  But running is three points.  You'd be fucking out of it.  I think running is worth three. 
[02:10:00]  I thought.  That's what it said on the website.  Running is worth one.  Somebody check with Gary, because I think it's worth three.  I think everything was worth one point.  Yeah.  So if E-Rock does three dips...  He wins.  Well...  No, you are out.  No, he's not going to run.  If E-Rock does three dips, Sam is out of the competition.  That's right.  No, I'm going to finish it, though.  That's right.  I think regardless, Sam is out.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Not regardless, because I could win this still.  No.  E-Rock, let's go.  Eric, three dips.  See?  I backed the right guy.  I told you. 
[02:10:30]  I told you he would win.  I backed the right fucking guy.  I backed E-Rock the whole time knowing this shit.  Me too.  Oh, God.  All right, well...  E-Rock, can you do three dips?  Here we can.  Oh, God.  He weighs 270 pounds.  He's a big boy, but...  He's a stocky boy.  Ready?  E-Rock, think poster.  Think poster.  Go.  All right, he's going down.  He's shaking.  Two, one.  One more, buddy.  One more, one more.  Three.  One more.  And four.  Oh, wow.  He did four dips.  Four dips.  Did you see him shaking? 
[02:11:00]  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Four dips.  Well, the score right now,  E-Rock, two.  Bobo, one.  Sam is out of the competition.  Cannot...  He has statistically lost this competition.  But I can still cost Bobo the V.  That's true.  If I go out and run and I win,  I get the point regardless,  and Bobo doesn't get it,  even if he comes in second.  And then Bobo's back from the show.  Sam is right.  That's true.  I can still compete.  You could be a spoiler.  I can get runner-up.  You're in spoiler position for Bobo. 
[02:11:30]  I can tell you haven't been for this radio program.  Yes, and for my fucking wallet today.  Yeah.  Cock sucker.  I can't believe it.  I was counting that much.  You're going to have to give E-Rock $200, sir.  I don't believe that.  Well, it's to me, but then it goes to E-Rock.  Then it goes right to E-Rock.  That's right.  So technically, you're giving E-Rock $200.  And Troy's got to give me $50,  which goes right into my fucking fund.  That's right.  Time to top for Troy.  Jim Norton fund.  I can't believe how bad you are.  Sam, you're really bad.  No, your push-ups sucked, too. 
[02:12:00]  No, they didn't suck.  They were better than Eric's.  No, you weren't going fast enough.  They were better than Eric's push-ups.  It doesn't matter.  Right now, I've totally switched.  Well, there's only one event left.  Can I do a double or nothing?  Jesus.  I'm going to go win running.  You guys are a lot younger than us.  What's wrong with you?  We're stuck here all the time.  What's wrong with you?  It doesn't matter.  Oh, your sit-ups were pretty impressive there.  Yeah, you're a fucking animal, E-Rock.  All right, we're going to the streets of New York. 
[02:12:30]  We've got Troy outside.  Yeah, we're out here on the corner of 49th and 6th.  It's a busy morning.  Everybody's walking into work.  Streets are quite congested,  but everybody's looking at them like they're a fucking asshole  sitting out here warming up.  Okay, it's the Physical Fitness Challenge.  Where are we at?  E-Rock won the push-ups and the dips.  Bobo, believe it or not, won the sit-ups.  Sam has no wins under his belt.  Sam, useless. 
[02:13:00]  Bobo has to beat Sam and E-Rock,  or E-Rock wins the whole thing.  Yeah.  That's it.  E-Rock doesn't even have to run.  That's true, yeah.  Because Bobo's not going to fucking win.  Well, I'm blowing this for everybody.  This thing's over.  E-Rock is the winner.  I don't know, because Sam, I don't have any faith in Sam now.  No.  I think Bobo will beat Sam.  You think Bobo?  And it's going to be a tie between E-Rock and Bobo. 
[02:13:30]  I do know Sam took up running.  But unfortunately, he didn't take up.  He can't do anything.  He didn't take up weightlifting.  The guy's useless.  I've never seen a guy that looks like he could be in shape fall so heavy doing sit-ups.  Did you see that?  He was crashing on the ground.  He has no muscles to keep himself steady.  He couldn't hold himself up.  He's got no core to him at all.  Troy, are you going to be able to fucking run with these guys?  I'm going to try to.  The streets are real congested, but I'm going to do the best to keep up with them.  And just tell me when you're ready, and I'll start. 
[02:14:00]  All right, so what are we doing?  We're running around the block, corner of 49th and 6th to 48th, up to 4th.  Okay, you know the deal.  It's a one-city block.  It's around the building, right?  All right.  We're going down to 7th Avenue, down to 49th, and then back up 6th Avenue.  All right, so one complete loop.  Yep.  All right, let's do this, Troy.  Are you guys ready?  Yeah, ready.  All right.  And go.  Wait, hold on.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yo, come back.  How already?  What happened, Troy?  Bobo takes off. 
[02:14:30]  Sam and Eric don't run, and then Sam decides to run, and Eric just stands there and is  looking at everybody.  Okay, are we ready this time?  You're making trouble here.  Hang on.  Why?  Because he doesn't have to.  But then again, Sam will lose on purpose.  Oh, wait.  If Sam loses on purpose.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, wait a minute.  Wait.  Sam could lose on purpose if E-Rock just stands there.  And then it'll be a tie between Bobo and E-Rock.  Tell E-Rock that Sam might have a plan.  Sam might have a plan.  They want you to know. 
[02:15:00]  So you have to run, tell him.  You have to run.  You have to be Bobo either way.  You have to be Bobo.  All right, you guys ready?  Yes.  Ready to do this?  Yeah.  Okay.  And go.  And they're off.  Okay, here we go.  Indeterminate races are coming around the corner.  Fat Boy right behind him.  Retard coming up the rear.  Retard.  Eric almost takes out some formation, guys.  We're running.  All right, who's in the lead?  People are looking like, what's going on?  Oh, sorry. 
[02:15:30]  It's a fire.  Who's in the lead, Troy?  Sam is in the lead.  Sam is in the lead.  We're approaching 7th Avenue.  Who's in the lead?  Sam.  Sam's going to win this.  Yeah.  Where's E-Rock?  Where's Bobo?  Bobo's?  I don't even see Bobo in the back.  Oh, jeez.  Way back.  Oh, no.  E-Rock's little legs.  Sam has about a 10-foot lead.  Wow.  Sam has a 10-foot lead.  It doesn't matter.  A lot of congestion.  A lot of people.  Yeah, but I think E-Rock wants to shut Sam off for once. 
[02:16:00]  Arterial congestion.  That doesn't matter.  You know.  He's still fat.  He's obese.  Poor fat kid.  They're running around the building, Opie, as we speak.  That's a big fucking city block building.  It is a big city block.  The lawyers weren't concerned about this part of the competition.  20 minutes to do 20 sit-ups.  Why did you give up?  Eric gave up?  E-Rock gave up?  Well, he fucking can't run. 
[02:16:30]  I completely gave up.  Let them run.  Let Sam still win.  So what are we looking at?  Sam and...  Tell Sam not to win.  No.  Tell Sam don't win.  No.  No.  Troy.  Tell Sam to put the brakes on.  No.  Throw this.  No.  So it's a tie between E-Rock and Bobo.  Tell him.  I ordered him to stop.  Sam.  No.  Shut up, Troy.  And orders you to stop.  Let Bobo win.  And orders you to stop. 
[02:17:00]  Tell him let Bobo win.  Let Bobo win.  You got it.  Did he just...  No, you can't throw the competition.  Hey, you can do whatever you want.  Troy, where's E-Rock?  Here's the rules.  E-Rock is way in the back.  I think he stopped to get breakfast.  E-Rock, stop.  But does he...  E-Rock's stupid.  Make sure Sam does not win, Troy.  Tell him don't win.  Where's Bobo?  Oh, here comes back.  I have to run it off.  Bobo's my only hope of not having to pay 200 bucks.  Eric is back.  Back in the game.  He's running, but Sam is making a run for it. 
[02:17:30]  No, tell Sam to stop.  Yeah, go, Sam.  Go, Sam.  Yeah, go.  Tell Sam to let Bobo win to make the tie.  Come on.  Bobo, I think it's still over on 49th.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Sam's got...  Tell Sam if he doesn't throw this.  He's off the show.  Sam, it says if you don't throw this, you're off the show.  Where are you, Troy? 
[02:18:00]  Troy, they probably only went 100 feet.  I know.  It's just all winded.  We just made the corner on 48th.  48th.  We're approaching the end.  All right.  I don't even see Eric or Bobo.  Holy shit.  He doesn't even see them?  It's fucking city blocks.  Come on.  Yeah, I don't even...  Unless they're taking a shortcut, they cut through over there.  Eric's not even doing it.  Yeah, E-Rock, he did the best for him.  E-Rock's not doing it.  What about Bobo?  Where's Bobo? 
[02:18:30]  Bobo is nowhere to be found.  He got lost going around a building.  He got lost going around a square building.  What a knucklehead.  The only one to finish here is Sam.  Sam, did he complete the race there, Troy?  He did.  He completed the race.  So that's it.  E-Rock wins.  I swear to God.  Doesn't he understand how this would have worked?  He's technically saying that he didn't finish the race.  He's right at the finish line.  He's not finishing it.  Oh, he has not crossed over the line yet.  Right. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, well, this is interesting.  And Eric will not win because he cut through.  Wait, where are you coming from?  It looks like Bobo just turned around and he's coming back up 49.  He went the wrong way.  No, he's not as dumb as everybody thinks.  Go around.  Wait.  Bobo, what are you doing?  Where did you come from?  Why did you go?  Where did you come from?  No, I saw the people ahead of me going that way.  I thought I did.  You thought you did what?  I thought I saw them going this way. 
[02:19:30]  So where'd you go?  No, no.  I ran around the block.  I saw through the stairs.  I thought the stairs were part of the route.  There's a lot of confusion going on.  Hold on.  Enjoy that.  The race is around the city block, but he thought the stairs were part of the route.  I thought the stairs were part of the route.  There's no stairs as far as city blocks go.  Yeah.  Sam might as well.  Bobo's too stupid to run around four corners. 
[02:20:00]  I think Bobo is disqualified, so.  And Sam wins the race.  Great.  So Sam wins the running competition.  Bobo, Sam too weak to make me win 200 bucks.  Bobo, too stupid to make it so I didn't lose 200 dollars.  I should have won the push-up contest.  That should be two points.  Shut up.  You should have.  Oh, Sam.  Could you win the hit-by-a-bust contest?  Oh, Sam.  I'm owed a point.  Eric should be taken away.  I win this thing.  Well, this is the deal. 
[02:20:30]  E-Rock wins, which means give me $200.  200 bucks.  This sucks.  And who?  All right, wait a minute.  And Ron wins.  Hold on a minute here.  Ron.  Yes.  Congratulations, brother.  I can't believe E-Rock gets that.  You, because you were backing E-Rock, won the competition.  The ONA Physical Fitness Challenge, sponsored by Pocono Raceway.  For race dates and ticket info, visit PoconoRaceway.com.  You got two Skybox tickets to the 2011 Pocono 500 race events on June 10th and 12th, and $1,000 cash, sir. 
[02:21:00]  That's fucking great.  Yeah, fucking great.  Fucking great.  And Ed just lost $200.  Oh.  Because fucking...  I don't appreciate Anthony.  For two reasons.  Two reasons I lost.  What are the reasons?  Because Sam's a weakling little girl.  That's wild.  And I...  Well, I knew the other one.  Bobo's a retard.  He can't make...  Fucking...  He can't make his way around a square building. 
[02:21:30]  It's like...  You start, and then you end where you started, by going around.  I want to talk to Troy.  Troy.  Okay, hang on a second.  Here's Troy.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Troy.  Hey.  What did Bobo do?  Because we're still trying to figure it out.  What did he do?  Yeah.  I'm a little confused myself.  He went down 49th Street.  Got that.  He said that he got lost, and then he came back 49th.  So he came in the direction that we ran down. 
[02:22:00]  Bobo, where...  So you went down this way.  Then where'd you go?  You know, I go straight towards the steps.  What steps?  What steps?  How did you get lost?  He's pointing to where the fuck...  There's no steps.  It's a sidewalk that goes around a fucking building.  What's wrong with this guy?  Were you racing in the subway?  I don't even think he went around the building.  I think he cut through the other side.  There's a little way he can cut through. 
[02:22:30]  I thought I saw the two people ahead of me go through that way.  Do you know who the two people ahead of you were?  Sam and E-Rock.  Where do you think they went?  I think they put him there.  He doesn't even know what he's talking about.  He has no idea how to run around a building.  No.  He's pointing to the Fox building.  He's saying he came from there.  What?  It's not even the same building.  It's far ahead of me, so...  What stairs?  What I think I saw. 
[02:23:00]  People are claiming perhaps Bobo had a mini-stroke.  Either one of those.  Quite possibly.  I'd make sure that.  Unbelievable.  Right.  That stuck open.  Well, I would sit down the whole time.  I was just going to help.  Vacuumly.  How bad of a start I got.  What do you mean you got a bad start?  How do you get a bad start?  Yeah, what happened to your start?  I don't know.  I thought I got a full start.  I thought I jumped the gun.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Wish you'd suck on the gun.  A music legend.  A music superstar.  Is that Sirius XM?  Jennifer Lopez.  Why do you think I'm singing this song, Eric?  J-Lo is in the building.  Why would you call me that?  Delayed answer to your question.  That's a horrible thing to say.  Jennifer Lopez is in the building.  Yes.  In the house.  You've killed my morale.  But she's here.  That's right.  She's got a nice looking ass.  She's in the building.  She's promoting something or other.  We wouldn't know because we didn't have her on the show.  But Jim needs his picture signed. 
[02:24:00]  Follow the saga as Jim tries to get Jennifer Lopez's autograph.  Right now.  O.P. Anthony's worst of 2011 so far.  What is this asshole setting up for?  Who's he?  He was just thinking the same thing.  Whose fucking career is he hijacking now?  No, but I just want to try to get...  Shut up.  Whose picture is it?  We know what you're trying to do.  He's got a picture with everyone from American Idol.  He's got a cast.  Everyone, including Ryan Seacrest.  And now he wants J-Lo to sign the picture.  It's not good enough that he's got a photo with everybody. 
[02:24:30]  I did Leno with him.  I did a Tonight Show with the cast.  They were the lead guest.  And you took a picture with him?  Yeah, with all four of them.  And now he gets the picture blown up.  And now you're going to fucking try to muscle your way into this fucking bitch?  Now she's going to be passing by.  She's going to chop his head off.  Not trying to get it signed.  We just heard, this is all we heard, that she's going to be passing by.  J-Lo's going to be passing by our studio.  Yeah, open up that curtain because she's going to pass by in that corner.  To go to another show.  Not to our show.  And somehow...  Oh, she blows him off so bad.  Oh, would that be the best? 
[02:25:00]  Somehow, Jimmy's going to try to get this signed.  I would never do that because...  Jimmy said no.  I would never do that to Jimmy because I know this is...  That would be the end of...  You would never be able to talk to him again.  Yeah, this is way, way like...  You'd fuck with his pictures.  You'd smash his phone before you tore this picture up.  Yeah, yeah.  Before you'd fuck with his pictures.  How come Norton always looks like the guy in the picture, though?  Like...  How come like...  If you didn't know who was who, you'd be like...  You'd just go, this guy is taking the picture with them, right? 
[02:25:30]  Look at these fucking zombies here.  Yeah.  She looks good, though.  She looks really good.  Does she look good in person?  Oh, she was juicy, man.  Very juicy.  Yeah, I like that, though.  She lets you put your fucking fingers on her hip.  Dude, they were there for a while.  We tried to get everybody...  She was the first one I did.  I'm like, we put our arms around each other and we just waited for everybody to show up.  How was the hip?  Fucking amazing.  Felt good?  As good as you think it would.  Yeah, you feel a curve.  He didn't even acknowledge... 
[02:26:00]  He didn't...  He didn't care.  He just wanted the pictures to come out nice.  I remember the way her back felt because she had like an open back dress and my hand  was actually on the skin of her...  Oh, was it sweaty?  No.  Did you smell your hand after?  No, I'm not that creepy.  That's not creepy.  If you touch somebody's back like that...  What, Patrice?  I'm just looking at Norton.  Maybe I should have did what he did.  It's just like it's interesting to me that Norton is this much of a...  Fucking dude that does this.  Yeah, yeah.  And I should be.  Like, I should just be like taking pictures, but I don't know why I didn't. 
[02:26:30]  That will be the obsession now.  But I didn't...  I didn't get...  It'll start with hopefully J-Lo today, which I doubt.  That's going to be really tough.  And then eventually he'll get Steven Tyler and the rest of those guys to fucking sign that  picture.  Right?  You want all those people...  Yeah, why not?  Then you frame it.  It's just a cool thing to have.  Why not again?  Why do you have that?  How do you...  Why do you have that picture?  That's what...  You just...  Why do you have...  To me, the picture would be good enough.  No.  I just knew she was going to be in the building today, so I brought her here.  Oh, you knew it already.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's way ahead of everybody. 
[02:27:00]  Wouldn't that be great if we just pushed around a file cabinet, four pictures?  Wait a minute.  Let me...  Are you on the J or are you on the A for American Idol?  I'm not sure.  You fucking...  And how do you ask?  Say, would you mind signing this photo of us?  And they never say no.  Leap, scum.  The only one that has ever said no to a picture of us being signed was Jeter.  That was the only asshole.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I see a posse.  I see a posse.  Oh, that's actually how she just walked by. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, that's why...  Oh, that's why...  That's why these two dudes were staring at me.  Oh, shit.  I was coming in this morning, and there was a...  That guy, and then a little aversion of that guy, the black dude that she's with, evidently  is her bodyguard.  I say, hey, what's up, bro?  And they gave me that once-over kind of thing, but, you know.  Let me...  Based on what I just saw, let me make an assessment.  There's not a chance.  You are not fucking getting near. 
[02:28:00]  That's a guaranteed fact.  If you got money on it, I'll put it on.  I will...  Norton will not get a chance.  Not only get a chance.  Not only was she the center of a fucking people convoy going down there.  She was unrecognizable.  She was in the fucking...  Right in the middle of an animal coat, which means she don't care.  She had a coat on, and her big hood pulled over her head as she walked with her face down,  down the fucking hallway wearing sunglasses.  Norton is calling this political fuck.  He's texting this political connection now. 
[02:28:30]  Can I text you somebody?  Shut up.  You know, maybe we could use some of your contacts.  What is Kenny doing now?  He's on the case?  Oh, shit.  What?  Where is he?  He's there.  He's going to take care of it.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  It's not usually hard to get them here.  They're all...  I thought you were going to run in.  Kenny, Kenny, can I wait after?  Do that.  Let me talk to you a second.  Kenny, Kenny, this doesn't count.  Come on.  We got to talk to Kenny.  Kenny, Kenny, get Kenny in here, man. 
[02:29:00]  Kenny, it does not count.  Kenny has connections with other guys who protect other guys.  Right.  No, that was Steve Leeds as the head booker here.  Yeah.  And that's the guy that...  They usually...  All the bookers will help you.  It's like, it's not that hard to do here.  I wasn't going to bum rush you with a bodyguard.  I would actually stop and ask the publicist.  Look, we did Leno together.  They feel bad.  They don't want to say no to somebody you did TV with.  They just feel stupid saying no.  Yeah.  No one knows that as a psychological profile.  But I would never say no.  I'm muscling people for a fucking...  Why?  Why?  I would never say no.  I would never say no to that. 
[02:29:30]  Hello.  Hi, Kenny.  Thank you.  Hi, Kenny.  Kenny, what?  Where's the picture right now?  It's in the custody of Stephen Leeds.  Stephen Leeds.  Yes.  Who will now walk up to J-Lo and have her sign it.  She'll go to her publicist and go, look, this is the idea of this.  She'll look at that picture.  It's on the Tonight Show set.  Why wouldn't she?  He knows the entire game.  Yeah.  I hope she signs it in the wrong spot.  I hope she signs it in the spot that I know Jimmy doesn't want it signed in.  Because it's...  Wait, where's he going?  I don't know.  He's going...  Wait, wait, wait.  He's walking down the hall with your picture. 
[02:30:00]  Oh!  Down the hall.  He's finding a secretary to sign J-Lo's name.  He's not going to bother J-Lo.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no, Sam's running after Steve.  Look at his stupid face.  Jimmy is freaking out.  Please.  Here's why I'm freaked out.  I'm not freaked out.  He probably left it with her publicist.  Because the envelope he's carrying is too small to carry the picture.  And I hope he doesn't have it in there and he's bending it up.  That's what I'm bothered by.  Oh, Jimmy, you can't take this.  Sam, come here.  Sam, Sam, Sam.  Sam ran down the hall. 
[02:30:30]  Norton just swallowed his gum.  This is great.  Sam, what happened?  Because Steve Leeds had the Jimmy picture for J-Lo to sign.  And he was over there down by the studio when J-Lo was broadcasting.  He's not going to bother him.  And then he just walked away and down the hall with the little envelope.  He's still holding the picture.  Why?  He's not going to bother J-Lo.  He said he's going right now.  He said, I'm going to Greenstein's office.  Tell him to calm down.  Yeah, he'll do it.  He'll do it.  Steve will do it.  She's here for an hour. 
[02:31:00]  He said, tell him I'm putting it in the paper shredder.  Yeah, that means he'll get it done.  What if it's in that little envelope getting crumbled up?  Then it's not going to be crumbled up.  He'll keep it straight.  Steve Leeds is good.  Here's what a great bet this would be now that this other guy has it.  I still bet he doesn't bother J-Lo.  There's going to be a problem.  I don't know whether it's getting signed or not.  But I know there will be a problem.  Put your money where your mouth is, man.  Let's just do a $10 bet.  I'll bet you $50 and it gets signed.  I'm only going to bet $10. 
[02:31:30]  I'll bet you $10.  Because this is a 50-50 deal.  I'll bet $10.  But I'm starting to think it's going to get signed.  I know it will.  You think it will.  Yeah, I'm starting to think it's going to get signed.  But you should also know that Steve Leeds might be annoyed because when Kenny handed  in the picture, he said, watch the fingerprints.  Oh, Jesus.  Did you have said to Steve Leeds?  Jimmy's looking like, oh, Kenny.  That would be a problem, though.  No, that's not a problem.  No, if there were fingerprints on the picture, Kenny would hear.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's why I said it.  Yeah, but you know, he would hear. 
[02:32:00]  What if she signed it over, like, fucking Steven Tyler?  Actually, it wouldn't matter to me where she signed it.  Really?  Nah, because if all four of them signed it.  You want it, but you'd best want it, like, low on her, right?  The reality is this.  I just took the fucking, I took the holy grail of signed photos in yesterday for a framing,  so this is all nice.  And what was it?  My Sabbath.  My signed Sabbath.  That's all.  That's in life.  Everybody.  Can we talk about them all?  Me and the band, and I finally got the fourth one.  Yeah, I had to be sent to L.A.  I had to go to L.A. and do it.  It was a fucking nightmare.  It was a clusterfuck. 
[02:32:30]  Let's talk to Steve Leeds.  I have faith in Steve Leeds.  It's crumbled.  Oh, look.  It's folded up inside that fucking envelope.  Oh, he's...  Why is it in the envelope now?  It shouldn't be.  Oh, God damn.  It really is in the envelope.  It's rippling.  I have faith in Steve Leeds.  Steve.  Steve.  This has become a thing, huh?  I have faith in Steve Leeds.  Good morning.  Hi, Steve.  Yeah, there's your mic.  You don't have faith in me.  I do.  Get over here.  Get over here.  Oh, yeah.  I do.  You know how to do a radio.  Good morning.  What's going on, Steve Leeds?  I tried to text you, but I think I had the wrong number for you.  The great Steve Leeds.  I don't know about that, but... 
[02:33:00]  Can I ask who Steve Leeds is, by the way?  I'm Patrice O'Neill.  How are you, sir?  Steve Leeds is a legendary record guy.  He runs the booking department here.  And now he runs the booking department.  Now, look how fast he forgot about Norton's picture.  No, no, no.  I hope he places it down and look at the top of a dumpster.  We'll get to that.  Sir, I pray you don't get this thing.  Hold on, hold on.  It's very important.  Steve's got a lot of history, though.  This photo's very important to Jimmy.  Steve will do.  It's an interesting photo because it's got all the current judges and a guy named Jim Norton.  Yes.  It's a very unique photo.  Yeah.  So, I have no problem when she's done asking her for the autograph.  Kevin Kenney said, careful, no fingerprints, gave you two colored markers. 
[02:33:30]  You can just use black.  It's fine.  I didn't ask him to say fingerprints.  I was scolding him for that.  No, it's fine.  You know better.  I thought it was interesting.  No, but Kenney was protecting himself because if there was a fingerprint on it, he would hear it.  What can I do to have you not do this, sir?  There's anything I can fucking do.  I'll be your bodyguard while I'm here.  I'll just walk around with you.  But look at that guy.  Come on.  Why do you want to mess with him?  I just want to see him pretend not to be tortured.  I'm not getting it. 
[02:34:00]  And meanwhile, he would be.  Here's a guy who has a great career.  He's on the radio every day.  Thank you.  He's got some best-selling books.  This guy is just nice.  And it makes me sick.  I want this.  I want you to trip and fall in a shredder.  Whoa!  And just to see his stupid face, sir.  But this is the only thing he lives for.  That's true.  It is true.  He has a great gig.  He's got a career.  And what he likes is getting his picture taken with celebrities and trying to get them autographed at the appropriate time.  Oh, my God.  J-Lo just walked by.  She left already.  She left.  She left. 
[02:34:30]  She's doing hits one now.  She's doing hits one.  Why did she walk the other way?  Don't you think this would help him, sir, in his low self-esteem, like, his jersey white trash, like, problem that he has where he has to take pictures with celebrities?  Hey, Roland is coming in.  Lisa, she's already signed.  She's got two minutes.  All right.  You want to grab her?  No, you can't.  Oh, that Roland. 
[02:35:00]  You guys are so mean.  He nailed you.  He gets me every time.  Roland gets me every time.  Dude.  Don't you funny this?  You just don't know.  Nothing in you wants to see him suffer behind this.  She's right there.  I think he suffers plenty.  We just don't see it.  If this is what he needs to feel good, then he's suffering, and I don't want to get into that.  Do you know how much he wants to tell you?  Could you not fiddle with it so much?  I think he'll be fine with the picture.  That was one of the greatest wisdom things I've ever heard. 
[02:35:30]  Jimmy's been looking at the picture the whole time Steve Leeds has been in here.  Did you just glaze over the wisdom of this guy just now?  Steve isn't handling it like Jimmy would.  He's kind of, like, rustling it around a little, and Jimmy's, like, looking at it, like, freaking out.  Well, Sam was chasing me down the hall.  I said, where are you going with that?  Jimmy wants to know.  I said, well, I could go to the bathroom, but...  Yeah, that would be nice.  You better not go to the bathroom with the picture, though.  That wouldn't be nice.  But I wasn't going to the bathroom.  See, this guy has Led Zeppelin stories, and now he's the go-between between Jimmy and Steve Leeds.  Well, if I wasn't on the air, I would just ask... 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, you know, after dealing with Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, Jimmy's easy, and I'm happy to help you in your dilemma here.  Thanks, man.  Now, step and fetch it.  Now.  Now.  Now.  He's just happy to still have a gig.  Thanks, buddy.  God bless Steve Leeds.  He really is a legend.  A fucking legend in this business.  As he goes away from...  Where's he going?  She's over there.  Does he know where she is?  No.  I couldn't believe that she went that way.  She's still that way.  She's still that way.  Oh, no. 
[02:36:30]  I couldn't believe that fucking...  And we just made Steve Leeds walk the wrong way.  Now he's going that way, thinking she's that way.  He'll go around that way.  He knows where she is.  Yeah.  Oh, Norton is just telling himself...  Jimmy's freaking...  She's good.  Oh, shit.  Here comes the entourage.  Stop it.  Look.  That's a drug one.  Roland got me good.  Roland is a one-man entourage.  E-Rock, take a peek out the door.  What's going on?  Is she wrapping up over there?  What's up, E?  It just seems like her hairstylist, her publicist, security, they're all just waiting by the door  to Al-Q, waiting for her to get out.  Al-Q. 
[02:37:00]  Eat my food!  What the fuck?  That's a smart-ass, man.  Who is that?  It was Roland.  Here's what I'm going to start doing.  Does Roland even work?  He's taking pictures of the people in the entourage.  Yeah.  Just go outside and take a picture with them.  Yeah, with the entourage.  This is J-Lo's people.  And all you have are a bunch of pictures with entourages.  That would be a very new idea.  It's kind of a unique new idea.  Do you know fucking twice in one airport, Dice got me when I was just starting to work with 
[02:37:30]  him?  Dude, he told me that one woman was Ann-Margaret.  Oh, no.  And I'm like...  It's Ann-Margaret over there.  But he goes, that's her over there.  And I took a picture with her, but it wasn't her.  And we were in Nashville, and I have a picture with a guy who I thought was Charlie Daniels.  He picks good enough people where you'd be like, it might be.  He's not saying, like, that's Dustin Hoffman.  I remember when he'd go, I'd go, can I have a picture with you? 
[02:38:00]  And he's like, ugh.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I have a photo with a guy.  I call it not Charlie Daniels.  Did we see the picture?  Did he ask you why do you want a picture with me?  I don't remember.  I know he was befuddled by it.  What did Ann-Margaret say?  Yeah, what did the not Ann-Margaret say?  I think she just took the picture.  She probably didn't know what it was for.  Because if you just walk up to someone at the airport and say, can I take a picture with  you, wouldn't they just say, why?  This is before 9-11, though.  This is small airports like Nashville, I think. 
[02:38:30]  I find people's, uh-oh, someone on a phone, a little makeup case.  Yeah, this is fucking, oh, shit.  They're on the move.  Steve Lee is in the hallway.  Steve's in the hallway.  He's eagerly awaiting.  The entourage should be, oh, oh, it's just so awesome.  Here they go.  Here they come.  Here they come.  They're going to go into hits.  One, two, three.  There she is.  She's got her coat off looking just lovely.  Whoa.  She's got her hair bumped up.  He'll ask the publicist.  Oh, shit.  Steve Lee's is walking right next to her.  He's outside now.  He's right next.  That's her.  That's her.  Yeah, but that was it.  Yeah, he'll get her. 
[02:39:00]  She's going to hits one.  He's coming back already.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Jimmy.  Steve's in the hallway.  It didn't look good because she looked down at the picture.  She didn't just go, sure.  She said something.  It didn't look good.  Ah, damn.  But she might have, uh...  What is Roland saying?  I wouldn't roll.  Was that an ass?  That was the famous J-Lo ass?  Yeah, that is.  That wasn't famous at all.  Jesus.  I don't know, though.  I want to...  You want a longer look?  I want to feel it.  Uh-oh.  Update.  Oh, shit. 
[02:39:30]  How did she look?  Oh, shit.  I saw the ass up close.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She said the same thing when she walked by you.  I don't get any past my mirror.  He didn't get it signed yet, but Steve Leeds broke the ice and was talking to her.  Yeah, I'm sure it's fine.  Was she friendly?  There's no ice break.  It's a signing shit.  No.  It's just either you do it or you don't.  She looked down.  Her arm stayed straight to her side.  She looked down.  There was some body language going on.  I didn't see any...  Do you have a pen kind of arm moving up? 
[02:40:00]  That's an immediate thing, Kenny.  Steve Leeds knows what he's doing.  Oh, shit.  He's bringing the folded envelope.  Piece of shit.  What a fucking asshole this guy is.  Roland gets me every time.  Roland walked in with the fucking envelope.  The photo was enfolded.  Any status report on the signing?  She's doing hits one.  No, she's canceling.  She's leaving.  Yeah, see?  Oh, boy.  Leeds is outside the studio with the picture.  What happened?  Kenny's laughing.  That means it had to be signed. 
[02:40:30]  Leeds is outside.  It had to be signed.  Oh, boy.  Is it signed?  Man, I'm telling you.  She fucking...  Still not signed.  She walked back.  I'm telling you.  He was on her when she came out, man.  We've been stalling it.  Get this picture signed.  I don't want to see Jimmy all sad.  You signed autographs, right?  Have you ever in your life thought about it?  No.  You either do it or you don't.  And if you didn't do it then, did you come back and do it later?  No.  No.  No.  Shut up.  Running out of time.  I don't want to hear you.  Nothing to convince yourself that this is going to happen. 
[02:41:00]  Can we get an update?  Steve, get back in here.  No, no, wait.  No, don't ask Steve because he's out there.  Steve, we'll ask him after the break.  Let him do it because she might...  Oh, because she might come out and if he's in here, it's going to screw it up.  She came out.  No, she's in another studio.  She's running away after this.  Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's get Steve Leeds in here.  That's not what she's speaking out.  Don't get him in here.  Yeah, let's just do it.  Kenny's watching the door.  Oh, no.  Steve.  Oh, no, Steve.  Do we have an update? 
[02:41:30]  Do we have an update?  I don't...  Is there an update on the signature?  No, no, no, no, no.  She's doing her interview now.  But we saw you do a little small talk while you guys were walking to Hits 1.  I was...  What were you saying to her?  I was just...  Jimmy is peering out the window like a hawk.  How mean he wanted me to be, and it's just against my...  It really is.  And he truly has a nice energy, man.  He's a nice man.  He's truly a nice man.  Nice aura about him.  Why do you want to hurt that guy?  I don't anymore.  Not because of you.  It seems like...  You explained it perfectly.  I always thought being nice was horseshit, but his niceness is not horseshit. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, it's kind of different.  Okay.  So, yeah.  So, when she's done with Caliente, and before she leaves, we'll get it autographed.  Thank you.  Can I ask you an autograph...  Don't ask me anything.  Jimmy's freaking...  Let me ask you...  Jimmy is losing his phone.  How about after the break, we can ask him.  We're going to be late anyway.  Autograph etiquette.  Autograph etiquette.  Patrice tends to be a little wordy, so this can really make...  Sir, autograph etiquette.  Jimmy is having an answer.  When someone is walking, why wouldn't they just pick up, take the picture out of your 
[02:42:30]  hand as you're walking, and then sign it as you're moving?  Which I would think would be the correct etiquette.  No, I think before you leave in the lobby here...  Steve, is she moving?  Because they're saying she's on her way.  I can't do this.  Roland is telling you that.  Roland never tells you the truth.  Why would you believe Roland again?  He just got you 15 minutes ago.  It was obvious he was fucking with you again.  Is she moving?  I love that.  Is she moving?  You know who was the dick who turned me down?  Busta Rhymes.  That was the one rapper that wasn't cool. 
[02:43:00]  And T.I. the first time I asked him.  And you asked him again?  No, at a different location.  I asked him here.  T.I. was not very nice, and Busta Rhymes was not nice.  It's the only two rappers.  Every other rapper's been great.  Busta Rhymes said no?  Yeah.  Why did Busta say no?  He just said no.  He was just being a prick.  Later, I'll ask him or whatever.  He's just being a dick.  He said later?  Yeah, whatever.  Just like what J-Lo did coming out of that room?  Oh, shit.  It was at a junket.  Yeah.  Maybe you can get tickets to the final episode of American Idol and just get them all.  Yeah, Lino can probably get you in and just go fucking get them all. 
[02:43:30]  I'm just watching Kenny.  I know.  Kenny's the barometer.  Lee's a little fucking flaky at times.  A little light.  Oh, he just went that way.  A little aloof.  Lee just went that way.  He's a little aloof.  Steve's never messed this up, though.  Neither has Liam.  Burt.  Hee, hee, hee.  These guys are the best.  Yeah.  Yes.  Good for them.  You know what?  I don't see a lot of fan photos with J-Lo, though.  I don't see a lot of photos of her.  Well, it's true.  Without her being alone or in some type of context or with her husband. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, boy.  There's no pictures of her with people.  I don't see any pictures of her with people.  Oh, boy.  With fans.  No.  Not a one.  Not a one.  All by herself.  Not one.  Her and her husband.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Either her by herself or her with her husband.  She just doesn't do it.  She doesn't do it.  She don't want to.  She's too high to get next to her.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But she's Jenny from the block.  Yeah.  She keeps it real.  She's still Jenny from the block.  She keeps it real.  Just her on the couch.  Just her on the couch.  Her husband again. 
[02:44:30]  She don't even have any with P. Diddy.  No.  Fuck that.  Yeah, those are ancient history.  This means she likes to control what...  Every picture that's taken.  Type in Patrice O'Neal real quick.  Yeah, but the picture's already taken.  He just wants to sign.  Just type in Patrice O'Neal.  Let me...  Let's see.  Let's see.  It's just...  O'Neal.  It's just a thousand pictures of me with people.  Look at you with people.  Yeah.  Just some fucking fucking...  The first little white girl in a mall.  Yeah, some lump.  Just shore.  At an airport somewhere in the Midwest.  Just fucking no problem. 
[02:45:00]  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Come on in.  They're on the move.  They're on the move.  They're going to be walking right by the window.  That'd be fine.  She's moving.  She's moving.  Where'd she go?  Her shoes, her children.  She didn't move yet.  No, she's actually moving.  They're gathering her stuff.  Where...  Which way is she going now?  She's going to go right here.  She's going to go...  Through here, yeah.  Oh, she's coming from that way?  Mm-hmm.  Down this way.  Good luck, Jimmy.  All right, so...  So we're going to get to see the ass.  Yeah, let's look at the ass.  Yeah, let's look at the ass.  As it comes by. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, where is she?  Did she blow off the other interview?  Mm-mm.  That's not good.  I want to see the famous ass.  Yeah, I want to see...  I want to really give it a look.  What is she promoting?  Fucking American Idol?  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.  Man, what the fuck?  A rating is it down?  Why would you have to do that?  I want to get a good look at it.  Oh, God.  I want to get a good look at it.  Yeah, it's really...  I got a good look at it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Watch all the people that walk by this studio.  Let me see this famous booty, man. 
[02:46:00]  All right, all right.  Here it goes.  They're clearing the hallway.  They're...  They actually cleared the hallway for her.  Yeah, they got...  The hallway's being cleared.  Here she comes.  Why wouldn't they clear Roland?  Look at you.  I know.  He looks like he could be a problem.  He looks like a...  He looks like a lungeist.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  There she is right there.  Okay, hold on.  Let's see if it's...  Hi.  Let's see if you can...  Hi.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  That thing defies gravity.  Look at him, look at Steve.  It ain't happening.  And there goes the picture of his son. 
[02:46:30]  He's chasing her around.  He's bringing him below.  He's the picture part of the entourage.  He's behind the makeup people.  He's chasing her around.  Did you hear Roland?  Roland goes, Steve, right, too.  Steve.  This shit ain't happening, man.  Why isn't the picture signed yet?  Why...  Did you see how fucking good it looks?  Why can't she sign it as she's walking?  Her ass was...  It's not a grass.  What?  It's not a grass. 
[02:47:00]  Why can't she just sign it as she's walking?  She will.  This is better.  Because he...  Honestly, he probably didn't ask her.  He did!  No, he didn't.  He asked her when he came out of that...  When she came out of that fucking room.  No, he didn't.  He did.  Guaranteed.  Right before that corner, he asked her.  I saw.  He didn't ask her.  She said nothing.  He was talking to her.  He didn't ask her.  I'm telling you.  She probably did it not yet.  Not yet.  Here's what it is.  This is politics.  Yeah.  She's...  You know, they...  It's a very incestuous business. 
[02:47:30]  She can't tell people anytime you go there  that there's going to be someone bothering you  for an autograph when you go to the radio.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got to know that.  She'll report that they bother you.  It's like, I don't want to go there  because now fucking people are going to be  bothering me for autographs.  Nah.  She'll take it.  She'll do it.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  She looks good, too.  The picture saga continues.  Opie Anthony's worst of 2011 so far.  The Jim Norton J-Lo picture has shut down the show.  It still hasn't been signed, by the way. 
[02:48:00]  And she's got a hard out at 9 o'clock.  Ten minutes to go to get this thing signed.  Yeah, she's anything on the clock.  She keeps it real, man.  She does keep it real.  Gunshots.  She'd be around, man.  She knows where she came from.  But autographs, man.  You can't...  You know, you don't sign no motherfucking autographs  from the Bronx, yo.  She's doing her third and last radio show  and then getting the fuck out of here.  Oh, Steve Lee's walking down the hall  without a picture.  Swear to God.  Shit.  Yeah, he doesn't have...  No picture in his hand.  I mean, he probably gave it to her publicist.  Oh, yeah, because the publicist 
[02:48:30]  is always going to make sure it gets signed.  Yeah, because that's what they do.  They're nice people.  Or maybe he left it there with Liam.  Everything's in the garbage.  You just don't...  It's funnier this way.  Liam may not be easy on the eyes,  but he's very good at this.  So it's either Liam or Leeds.  Both of them.  I'll have to wait and see.  Oh, here comes Steve Leeds.  Steve's running.  Oh, he ran.  He's running by.  That was a speed walk.  Oh, boy. 
[02:49:00]  Trying to keep it professional.  He probably got the word.  She's in the elevator.  If he runs by the window with that picture.  There's too much shit going on.  There's not.  Like, there's too much stuff going on for this.  It should be easy.  It is.  It's a person signing something.  But that's not why he's running.  Dude, this whole thing is not about my dumb photo.  He's running around because she's doing different shows.  So they're trying to get her to and from these shows.  No, is that it?  Yeah.  My picture is a fucking minute moment.  But that's just it.  It should be.  Do you understand?  It's a fucking picture that has to be signed by one person. 
[02:49:30]  And it will happen.  Why is this a big deal?  But it's not.  Oh, it is.  I got to hand it off.  It's going to places.  He gives it to the publicist.  It can't be between here and there.  It's got to be after that.  It's a big pain in the ass.  Let me tell you something.  We'll get her at the end.  If J-Lo gets...  With all those people, if J-Lo gets a picture in her fucking hand...  Yeah.  ...that, like, right away, someone will get fired.  Wait, wait.  If she gets a picture in her hand...  Sam's got an update, too.  Sam, you got an update, obviously. 
[02:50:00]  Hold on, hold on.  ...one of the major bosses that people don't like to...  Just saw.  ...do things...  Yeah, is walking up to meet with her.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  That could be a...  I've walked people out in the past.  That could be a monkey wrench thrown into the works right here.  It won't be.  Oh, no.  This is the power of positive.  I'm telling you.  I just read page three of the secret.  Envision it.  It will happen.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:50:30]  This will be such a buzzkill if this picture comes back signed.  It'll be such a buzzkill.  Oh, man.  It'll get signed.  Yeah, I actually think it will.  There's been times where I didn't think it would.  It's going to get signed?  Like, who didn't you think would sign here?  I didn't think Springsteen would get done, and it didn't.  I was pissed, but I knew that kind of wouldn't.  Jeter, when Jeter came in, I left that with...  I knew that wouldn't get done.  It didn't.  Why?  Because I think they were mostly with Scott. 
[02:51:00]  I think the bookers were kind of scared to win,  because I think he was walking them around.  So they didn't want to...  That's their boss.  Uh-oh.  What's going on?  Photographer.  They don't want to...  Yeah, but that means she's done, right?  She's going to go by again?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Check.  Watch.  Get a little recon.  Okay.  Check it out.  And by the way...  Give us a thumbs up when they're coming.  By the way, is Mars still standing out there like a fucking vulture?  Look at him.  Thumbs up.  He's so excited.  There he is.  Get Mars in here real fast.  Look at Mars.  Yeah, get him in here long enough so he can miss her. 
[02:51:30]  Look at his hair.  It's all fucked up.  He's a mess.  What's going on with you?  He's a fucking mess, man.  He's got cum in his hair.  He had to put the cum somewhere.  You're all right?  Shit.  You fucking...  Uh-oh.  Why is Sam running?  We're moving.  We're moving.  What do you mean?  Oh, the trees move.  Yeah, they're moving.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Okay.  Here she comes.  Here we go.  All right.  J-Lo's coming back around after doing another interview.  Take a look at it.  One person going.  It looks very, very good.  Yes.  All right.  One person.  Just stepped out. 
[02:52:00]  She's usually first or second in the entourage, though.  Waiting for the rest of the entourage.  It's not like the Kennedy Motorcade, where there's a whole bunch before.  There's only a couple, and then they all fall behind her, which is where you want to be  with her.  Here she is.  Watch this.  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here she goes.  There she goes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Look at the wall, dude.  She looks big.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  He's still got...  Look.  Look at Leeds.  He still has to finish her.  Oh, shit.  He still has to finish her.  He's following behind the entourage, and they're rushing to the elevator, and he just 
[02:52:30]  like, he was swinging the envelope, and he looked over with a smile that kind of looked  like...  Like a...  And he was about five people behind.  Oh, he's way behind.  Oh, this is looking good.  Oh, no.  He knew what I was doing while I was out there, and he laughed as if to say...  Oh, no.  Here's when he'll get her.  She'll stop and take photos at the Sirius thing, and he'll grab her there.  You think?  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  He knows what he's doing.  He's the head booker.  Liam has an update.  I'm hearing...  Liam has an update.  All right.  Here's an update from Liam.  Is that true?  Oh, Liam's got an update.  She looked at the photo.  It was like, where did I take this?  She's looking at the background.  She's like, I have no idea who this person is.  Why did I take this photo?  Really?  Yeah.  Well, will she sign it?  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  Yeah, Steve's with her.  Yeah, she just didn't remember.  Oh, my God.  Did you tell us to send it to Tonight Show?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, Kenny's running in.  She's taking pictures in front of the Sirius logo. 
[02:53:30]  Okay, yeah.  With who?  I don't know.  You want one?  No, I got one.  Patrice?  Will she take one with us?  Will she pull her bands down, nigga?  She laughing?  Yeah, go.  Take a picture of my face and ass.  Go.  If you go, I'll go.  Come on together.  No, nigga.  Go take your fucking photo, photo guy.  Nah, I already got one.  I have her not sign it.  Go in and say, hey, I already took a photo.  Do your own fucking field work now.  I always do my own field work.  I thought you might want one.  Go get that.  No, no, no. 
[02:54:00]  Go get that photo and say, I was on Tonight Show with you.  Can you sign this?  This might be it, Jimmy.  You might have to do it yourself.  Just look around a little bit.  That could be you.  You could do that, actually.  Jimmy's trying to look around.  He's grabbing his camera.  She's saying that right now.  Are you lying?  Yes.  But he still has to ask a question for him.  All right, let me see.  Yeah, I think you better go muscle him.  Go muscle him, Jimmy.  Yeah, call.  Go get through her seven-people entourage.  That's here to protect her.  And Travis is calling us so we can kind of see what's going on. 
[02:54:30]  He can't leave this to anyone else.  He's freaking out.  I love where he's like, no, no, she'll sign shit.  But he's freaking out the entire time.  He's panicking.  You can't hear this, can he?  No.  She already signed it.  She signed it.  Liam was lying.  Oh, okay.  Signed it a while ago?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Damn, she'll throw it away.  That sucks, man.  Except he's going to see her leaving, and he thinks that she hasn't signed it.  Oh.  And are they smart enough to go if she never signed it?  Liam was.  After she leaves?  I mean, Steve Leeds probably is going to.  Well, fucking go work it. 
[02:55:00]  Leeds will not be mean about it, but we want it.  All right, whatever.  I can't get to Leeds.  She's about 20 people around her.  We're walking down the hallway.  She signed the wall in an authorized spot.  She signed the wall in one of the authorized spots.  Authorized spot.  Very important.  Yeah, we'll have to explain that to Patrice in a minute or two here.  And she, Jim gave Kenny the camera.  She is leaving.  She is going into the elevator.  Did Jimmy get a picture? 
[02:55:30]  No?  Well, I'll let Jim tell you.  We're heading back to the studio right now.  Jimmy.  Finally.  Jennifer Lopez has left the building.  She's out of the building.  Her and her ass is gone.  I love how Patrice is just like, no, fuck the fuck.  Like, why would you?  Damn.  I wouldn't want to.  I wouldn't want to do with those pictures.  Oh, there's a thank you very much I just heard.  Oh, what was that about?  He's super happy.  Yeah, yeah, he is.  Oh, how funny.  Now he can breathe. 
[02:56:00]  Now he can breathe.  He can relax.  All his positive thinking.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I wish he was an ass.  God, that'd be so funny.  All right, here we go.  This is it.  Oh, look at the big smile.  Oh, my God.  Look at Jimmy's smile.  She was nice.  She wrote, I didn't talk to her.  She wrote to Jimmy.  She signed the whole fucking thing.  I had to say.  Thanks for everything.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  She wrecked it.  She wrecked your picture.  That's great.  What are you talking about?  No, she wrecked it.  How are you going to get the rest of them to sign it?  I'll get them all on it. 
[02:56:30]  I'll get them all on it.  No, no, Jimmy.  She wrecked it.  Please.  She signed the entire, she signed, all right, she literally signed half the picture all along the bottom.  Jimmy, you've got to tweet that.  No one else can see it now after all this.  Now is anyone else going to fucking.  Jimmy will tweet the picture.  I got.  She signed most of the picture.  Roland said that she, they were just fucking with me.  She actually signed it as soon as she got her.  Oh, shit.  He he he he he he he he he he.  Well, she, what'd she write? 
[02:57:00]  To Jim, thanks for everything, uh, Jennifer Lopez.  Thanks for everything.  Thanks for what?  I don't know.  Whatever you write.  Thanks for what?  Is that what she wrote?  What's she thanking you for?  You didn't do anything for her?  Maybe not actually approaching her again.  Did you get another picture with her?  No, I did not.  I didn't get to talk to her.  She was white.  I could have because she was taking them.  Yeah.  But I'm like, I already got one.  Who's the girl on the left?  Never mind.  Steven Tyler would be the answer.  Yeah.  Good line.  He is a weirdo.  What do you want to do?  He told a lot of bad jokes. 
[02:57:30]  No, he's horrible.  Well, Jimmy Fallon's back in studio.  He hosts the rather popular late night program.  And he's interested in hiring me.  Why are you still here?  I have loyalty.  I made the whole thing up, Eric.  He's not interested in hiring me.  I wish he was.  Damn it.  Yeah, no, I would love to go.  Jimmy Fallon, he's one of the nicest guys in show business.  And he stopped by.  He told a great story.  About Paul McCartney being on his show.  Yeah.  It's Jimmy Fallon on ONA.  We're both in Anthony's worst of 2011 so far. 
[02:58:00]  I got distracted because Jimmy Fallon's watching this.  Hi, Jimmy.  What's going on?  How are you doing, man?  We're just yapping about autos and driving fast.  Just so you know, on the conversation, Anthony went to Poconos Raceway over the weekend and  got to driving in a stock car after a half-hour lesson.  It's great.  Wait, this is crazy.  Yeah, you go down there.  You take a little course real quick.  And then you get on the track.  And you get in a real NASCAR stock car and driving around like 170 miles an hour.  Were you nervous? 
[02:58:30]  This is crazy.  No, you kind of...  Thank you.  I get nervous playing video games like that.  I play the video game.  I crash.  It's too much.  Yeah.  Being in a real car, actually, maybe get hurt.  You kind of...  The nerves go away through the course of the day and shit like that.  We got anybody else in here today?  And then I got to take my own car, though, because I got a Shelby Mustang GT500.  Pretty awesome.  And they let me take that out on the track.  I got one of these new video games, like a Gran Turismo for a PS3.  And someone sent me a steering wheel and a gas pedal to hook up to your... 
[02:59:00]  Doesn't it make the game so much better?  My wife was like, for instance, this is insane.  You're 36 years old.  You look like an idiot.  I got plastic gas pedals and a steering wheel.  So I'm looking next to like a baby.  We're babysitting.  The baby's got the same fake plastic.  Whatever, buddy.  There's Jimmy beeping the horn.  Yeah, I mean, it was the...  You have the floating steering wheel, so it's not even attached to anything.  I'm not even driving a...  I'm driving a Mini Cooper because that's an option.  It's like, why...  You're not even driving a fast, cool car.  You're an idiot.  Jimmy, you should do... 
[02:59:30]  Not that you need my help, but you should do this for your TV show.  Look at this.  You in a stock car?  It's complete and utter insanity.  It was in the Poconos?  Yeah.  Pocono Raceway.  Jimmy, there's nobody in the car with him.  They say, all right, take the car out, have fun.  This is what the video game looks like, except it's a video game.  This is frightening.  But this is it!  Yeah, you only get one car in this game.  Yeah.  If you hit the wall...  And you're not drunk driving in your video games.  I mean, this is insane.  You're getting thrown around and you never realize how... 
[03:00:00]  How fast are you going?  About 160 in this...  Are you out of your mind?  Yeah.  I would never do this.  It's so much fun.  And then you come out of the turn and just gas it again.  This is his actual video.  Do you know how to drive on the wall?  You're a good driver, clearly.  No, I'm a very impatient, horrid driver in the city.  But you took lessons?  How long did you learn?  Yeah, about 30 minutes in a classroom with a driver.  And then they give you these 600 horsepower NASCARs.  I mean, I don't see airbags.  I don't see anything that I need.  The safety equipment is pretty much the harness. 
[03:00:30]  And they strap your head back so you don't break your neck if something happens.  See, that's right.  Once anyone goes, you might break your neck doing this.  I go, I don't want to do this.  I don't want to do this.  This is so you have use of your feet in your old age.  Yeah, that's nice.  I mean, that's always a good thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just described this for over a half hour.  I said probably 20 times, how is this legal?  Like, how are you allowed to do this?  How is this legal?  Yeah.  Well, I think once you walk onto their property and sign a piece of paper, if anything happens,  hey, it's your fault.  We don't care.  Like, a guy could come up to you that owns the place and shoot you in the head. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  And your family can do nothing about it.  Or if you're struck by a bolt of lightning.  Yeah, yeah.  Is the Poconos still, is that the, so the honeymoon type of place, Poconos?  I think they have a couple of those places.  Remember that?  There used to be a big deal.  Mount Airy Lodge and stuff.  Yes.  As a matter of fact, after me and my buddy Danny did this, we went in a big champagne glass  bathtub, bubble bath, and they just lost each other.  Celebrated?  That's a manly thing to do.  Yeah, that was the heart-shaped bed.  It used to vibrate. 
[03:01:30]  When I was a kid, I remember the commercials.  The beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.  Oh, here it is.  Whoa, whoa.  Horseback riding.  And you went recently, though.  Oh, no.  Within the last 10 years.  Within the last 10 years.  They give you a swimming pool in your room now, right?  Yeah, yeah.  In the shape of a heart or something.  Well, this is an actual swimming pool.  Yeah, it was like a little, it was a rectangular swimming pool.  But you walk in there, it's not that big.  And you just know so much fucking went on in this pool.  Oh, totally.  It's just like, ah, God, I hope this, but they really.  You don't know what's gross with the bed or the pool. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, everything was horrible.  Whatever you look at, you go, oh, someone had sex on that.  Yeah, yeah.  You take in a black light, it looks like a Peter Maxx painting.  It's just all over the room, it's just glowing.  It's horrible.  It looks like a Jackson Pollock.  Yeah, it's like white over here.  Yeah, gross.  I was daring my girlfriend to look in the skimmer for the pool.  You don't want to see what you're going to find.  There's no trees in here, but it's full of something.  Welcome to your room.  It doesn't filter work.  It looked like someone dropped a toupee in there. 
[03:02:30]  It really was not, took the romance out of it.  But, yeah, we went there, and it was, the saddest part was going to dinner, and they  have this kind of family dining thing, kind of in a dining room setting, so you sit at  this picnic table looking thing, and we were there, like, goofing around, just drinking.  Louis Black was playing there.  So we were watching.  Was Louis doing the Poconos?  Yeah, he was doing the Poconos.  How great is that?  It really made me happy.  It makes you happy.  It was champagne.  We got it.  I see y'all in your glasses. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, he must have been miserable.  The only bathtub I have is in the shape of a heart.  I hate romance.  You have a clogged artery.  Are you having fun?  Then tell your face, you old.  The Saturday Night Lines.  Tell your face is the greatest.  There was a couple there that was all, like, big, wide-eyed and stuff, so my girl leans  over and she goes, so where are you from?  And they were from Iowa.  They had driven from Iowa to Poconos, Mount Derry Lodge, wherever it was, for their honeymoon. 
[03:03:30]  It was, they had just got, it was like, yeah, we just got married and we're here, you know,  on our honeymoon.  He chose to go to do this.  Yeah, to do this.  Okay.  Okay, sir.  Yeah.  We're going to do some horseback riding.  Yeah, really?  Couldn't do that in Iowa?  Seriously.  I mean, I would think you could probably do some horseback riding in Iowa.  It's like, I mean, travel's not the most fun thing in the world, but you can kind of go  anywhere now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're not that expensive.  Good drive to, uh...  Get that William Shatner website, whatever he has, and you get, like, some good deals. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, Priceline.  Priceline.  Priceline.  Yeah.  Well, how are you, Jimmy?  You have to leave a thank you note.  Oh, well, look at that.  Nice segue.  Jim Norton is amazing.  Jim Norton is the master.  He is the best.  We just saw you on TV with this sweater thing you got.  Yeah, I made a prediction.  I was like, Jimmy Fallon will come in here with a white shirt with black or brownish stripes.  Yeah.  And, uh, everyone was amazed until they saw you go on TV.  Yeah, it wasn't that bad.  I knew it wasn't taped.  That's pretty good.  It would have been embarrassing.  Like a mime.  I mean, almost like a French mime. 
[03:04:30]  It is very French of you.  You should have a beret and a little pencil mustache.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to be artsy this morning.  You have to be in shape to pull that off, too.  You have to be in shape to pull that off.  You can have a gut.  You have stripes and wipes.  This is supposed to be going up and down.  I disagree.  Really?  No, you're in shape is what he's saying.  You can pull that off.  I know, but I'm saying I'm tired right now.  I'm not in shape.  No?  No, it's just, it's that rule that makes you think I'm in shape.  I'm totally not in shape.  Oh.  Is it an XL?  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Absolutely, yeah, yeah. 
[03:05:00]  I'm treating them like it's a medium.  All right, my fault.  If people don't understand why stripes are kind of a thing that can show your fat, look  at those things.  You ever see where they have to show space in the universe and how gravity acts on it?  They make that grid.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what happens.  That's three-dimensional, yeah, yeah.  You look like, oh, I see where the gravity is.  Where the gravity is.  The concave.  Yes.  I see where the beer belly is.  I can see if I released a marble where it would spin.  Right around your belly.  I released a marble.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see what's going on there.  Yeah, no, yeah. 
[03:05:30]  I'm going around.  Man, I'm plugging this book.  Thank you, notes.  Yes, I've been keeping up on your tweets.  You're a good tweeter.  Yeah.  I like it.  Because you have funny tweets, and you also play little games with people.  You let people get involved.  Hashtag games.  I like that.  Yeah, the hashtag games.  You can hear a hashtag.  Yeah.  We'd like to just get as social as we can with our show.  Are you still enjoying the Twitter?  Yeah, yeah.  You are, yeah.  My problem is, after like, and I don't even have to be drunk, half a beer, and my inhibition 
[03:06:00]  level goes down 90%, and I'll be like, yeah, you sent it.  Oh, you've got to hide it.  You really have to think twice.  Hide your kids.  Hide your eyes.  Hide your phone.  Hide the phone.  Hide the phone.  Lock up the phone.  You could really pop in some career enders.  Oh, totally.  You should have to blow into a tube before you Twitter.  Right?  I mean, John Mayer, right, was told by his people, he said, you can't have Twitter anymore. 
[03:06:30]  You're not allowed to have Twitter.  You're not allowed to be on Twitter anymore.  Is that why Miley Cyrus dumped hers, too?  I wonder if they were afraid of what they were going to say.  I think she was just on Salve.  She didn't even know what was going on.  She ate her phone.  She didn't know what it was.  She thought it was melting in her hand.  Actually logged out of her Twitter account by mistake.  But, yeah.  It is a very dangerous thing.  I mean, it's hard.  It was hard enough in the past just texting a friend and the next morning going, dude,  I'm sorry I texted that.  But now you're texting the world that you're an asshole. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have to watch it out.  I remember I got thrown out of a pizzeria in New York.  And I just got so mad.  I tweeted about it.  I went off.  How did you get thrown out?  Why did they throw you out?  It's the silliest story.  You're a very nice man.  You're too nice to be thrown out anywhere.  It's the silliest thing in my life.  I went out with my friends, and they were doing a pizza tasting thing.  So I went on a pizza tasting thing. 
[03:07:30]  So I went, and I didn't realize that my quotes or whatever will be, they write for New York magazine.  Oh, yeah, okay.  So I went out, and we had this pizza, and they go, no, I don't like this pizza.  And I was actually sticking up for it.  I go, it's not fair to compare this pizza to another pizza because this is like a, it's almost like a Ritz cracker with sauce and cheese on it,  which I, by the way, sounds pretty good.  I like English muffin pizzas.  I don't, I'm a snob.  Right.  But anyways, they wrote that, and I guess the owner didn't like it or something like that and read that I wrote this review, 
[03:08:00]  and I walk in.  My brother-in-law was there when he had his baby with him.  The baby's sleeping in the stroller.  So I walk in, I sit down, and the girl comes over, and she goes, I can't serve you.  You have to leave.  And she's smiling, which makes me even more mad.  Oh, man.  So I go, they were just waiting for you to fuck on it again.  She loved it, loved it, couldn't wait to do this.  And I was like, so I started joking.  So I go, okay, good, I'll leave too.  I mean, let's leave together.  Let's go somewhere else.  Let's go to a different pizza or whatever. 
[03:08:30]  She goes, no, I'm serious.  You got to leave.  And I was like, I know that my wife came, my wife was there, and this baby's sleeping.  And I go, are you serious?  Like, what are you talking about?  She goes, you know what you did.  You know what you did.  And I go, I don't know what's going on.  Could you explain to my wife this isn't sexual?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like, yeah, I had nothing.  I'd never met you before.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't care about the pizza, but you really screwed up my marriage.  She goes, you know, the review in New York Magazine. 
[03:09:00]  You know.  Wow.  And I go, I didn't even know.  So I was so mad.  And it went, and I just tweeted out, like, screw this place.  That's brutal.  Good for you.  Don't ever go.  But then, you know, it's more advertised for this dumb place.  No, that's bad advertising.  All press is not good press.  When you're trashing it, good for you.  But they want to go to the place that Fallon thought sucked.  They just showed him.  Yeah, exactly, yeah.  I was so mad.  Yeah, I was like.  But you're here.  Did you want to go back in?  I never went back in.  Good.  But you know what's fun is that I could get delivery.  You could.  And I could stay if I really wanted that Ritzcracker crap piece. 
[03:09:30]  But you don't want them to ever be on to you.  No.  That it's you because, you know.  Hakalugi.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a Grimaldi's now in the Limelight Marketplace.  You remember the Limelight?  Used to be a dance club?  Yeah, of course.  Now it's a mall.  A mall.  It's a shopping mall.  It used to be.  You could probably still find ecstasy underneath, like, the produce.  Yeah, you see people walking, they're like, dude, I threw up over there.  Now they're selling, you know, Hunter boots.  With the Limelight, where is that?  That's on 6th and, uh.  Is it like an old church?  Yeah, the old church. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, the old church.  That is a limelight.  That's a mall?  That's not a mall.  The 20th and 6th, I think.  Oh, yeah.  I should go in there.  Oh, where is that?  There were a few complaints from the residents.  But they have Grimaldi's Pizza.  Like, Brooklyn, good.  Grimaldi's is really good.  Grimaldi's is really good.  So that's there now.  I'm, like, so excited.  John's Pizza.  I used to go there on Pop Lock.  John's is phenomenal, too.  There's a place in Brooklyn called Motorino.  Is that number one?  John's is, like, number two, I believe.  Motorino, this place.  Like, the secret to the pizza, which is what these guys are talking about, is, no, it's  the, how hot is the oven?  Shit.  Really?  So if the oven's, like, 900 degrees, it should take you only, like, two minutes to cook the 
[03:10:30]  pizza.  Right.  You throw it in, seriously, two, it's like microwave.  It's fast.  It's like, that's what I'm saying.  So it's like a Celeste pizza.  Yes.  Mama Celeste.  Mama Celeste.  Remember those in the freezer?  I still have them in my freezer.  Yeah, man.  Fantastic.  So, but then they pull it in the, it's a little burnt, and you have a couple burnt crust,  you know, bubbles there.  I was stupid, because we went to John's Pizza, and I like pasta, and I saw spaghetti in the  menu.  I'm like, I want spaghetti.  Why would you do that if you were at the number one pizza place in all of the menu? 
[03:11:00]  They shouldn't even have it on the menu.  And their spaghetti sucked.  Tastes like pizza.  Their meatballs were awful, and then I had a slice of the pizza.  I'm like, of course.  That's why you go here.  Don't order anything else.  Then you go to, like, the pasta place, and you get a slice of pizza.  I know.  Jimmy doesn't have a lot of time here.  Roland just said you got to go.  You're a very busy man.  Oh, Roland.  I can stay.  I got to ask you something.  It's like, when you first got on to do the show, a lot of skeptics.  There were a lot of skeptics.  You can fall and handle late night and shit like that.  You have been really tearing it up. 
[03:11:30]  You know, I'm sure you knock wood when that happens.  Completely.  It's like, great.  But do you feel like you've shown people, like, hey, I can do this?  Because as a performer, everybody probably thought, oh, fuck, if I fuck this up, I'm going  to look like an asshole.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I knew this was my last thing.  Do you feel vindicated?  Not really.  I don't think I ever will.  No, no.  It's still a fight.  I think it's going to take, you know, I'd say I've only been on for two years.  So I'd say if five years, if I'm still on, then I go, okay, then I can go, I did a decent  job.  But there had to have been some kind of buzz and support right from the beginning because 
[03:12:00]  they don't give people that long.  You know, it's.  Yeah.  I mean, you guys were on when I first was on.  I mean, I think I've changed even since then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  First six months or something.  You guys came on, but it's like, we're, we're calmed down a bit more.  And I, I, you know, you don't know the crew.  You don't know the, I don't know how to host a talk show.  You know, I don't know how to, you know, probably when you first came on to do, you  know, radio, you didn't know how to do radio.  You know, it's like you learn by doing it.  I guess.  Dude, you sang with McCartney.  How great is that?  I know.  What a great gig that is. 
[03:12:30]  It got crazy.  I mean.  Some of the shit you're able to do is like, wow, man.  It got, it got really crazy.  I mean, when Springsteen wanted to do a bit and you go like, this is just getting crazy.  And it's like, you can't, you can't, you have to put a horseplay and just got to go.  I can't.  I was going to ask.  Think about it.  How do you hold it together when you're sitting with McCartney?  You're like, that's, that's fucking, I don't care who you are.  That's fucking Paul McCartney.  I went down.  He was on Saturday Night Live that week.  And so I went down to his dressing room to get him to, uh, just to say what we're going  to do on the show.  They let you back in there.  Yeah.  They, they let me back in.  Yeah.  I still have my old key. 
[03:13:00]  So my old ID pass.  I went in and I go, he goes, you know, we're just going to do a chat.  You know, we'll just do a quick chat and that'll be great.  You know, Jimmy, your show's doing good.  You know, I go, cool.  I go, uh, uh, and I was like, I clearly, I don't think he's ever seen the show, but I  go, okay, he's being nice.  So I go, well, I was wondering if you want to do this bit, uh, because I know, you know,  when you, when you wrote yesterday, you know, the original lyrics were, were scrambled  eggs.  Yeah.  Cause you know, back in the day, so he wouldn't forget it in his sleep.  He wrote scrambled eggs.  Oh my lady, how I love your legs. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  And so that's who he remembered, like, da, da, da, da, da, da, the tune.  And so he goes, yeah, that's true.  I go, well, me and this writer, it was this guy, Mike, we wrote the rest, the rest of  the song, scrambled eggs, the original.  And he's like, oh, you know, I think I'm just going to do a chat, you know, just a quick  talk and that's all.  Okay.  But it shows gray.  It's really great.  I go, well, can I just do it for you?  I just want to sing it for you quick.  And if you want to do it, you can.  If not, I go in front of McCartney.  Wow.  And if you want to do it, you can.  If you don't, then I'm going to do it either way. 
[03:14:00]  I'll wear a wig and I'll do it.  He's like, well, okay.  So I go, scrambled eggs, oh, lady, how I love your legs, but not as much as I love  scrambled eggs.  Oh, have you tried scrambled eggs, waffle fries?  Oh, my baby, how I love your thighs, but not as much as I love waffle fries.  Yeah.  So then people in the room start laughing and next thing I know, his head's right over  my shoulder.  Oh, shit.  Reading it off the page.  He's like, they are so damn good.  And he's singing.  I was like, so then he gets his guitar and I'm like, oh, my gosh. 
[03:14:30]  So now it's like, so I go, oh, my God, Ringo.  So then he goes, yeah.  He goes, I said, all right.  So would you want to do it?  He goes, oh, don't worry.  You're doing it with me.  And I'm like, you don't have to fight me on this.  I mean, yeah, I'd love, I'd be honored to do it with you.  So and then I didn't stop there, of course, because I'm just, you know, ridiculous.  But it was the anniversary of John Lennon's death.  And I said, you know, this is the anniversary.  He goes, oh, no, of course.  And I go, you have that great song called Here Today, because I'm a giant McCartney fan.  It was on the Tug of War album. 
[03:15:00]  It's a beautiful song about, like, what would you say if you were around today?  You know, would you say we're friends?  Would you say that we're enemies?  It's a beautiful song.  And he.  Wait, is it about Lennon?  It's about John Lennon.  It's a beautiful song.  I said, I'd love it if you just did that.  Like, let me get the other guitar.  Let me try.  So he got it out.  He goes, all right, yeah, I could do that.  And he came on the show and he sang.  And he did scramble the eggs.  Yeah.  And he sang here today.  Oh, how do you.  We can't get a stripper to show her tits. 
[03:15:30]  Ties are getting tough for us, Jimmy.  Well, I'll help you out.  Next time I'm in, I'll get somebody to help you guys out.  Wow.  That is a great story.  By the way, also on SNL, the frigging Bee Gees thing.  It's a serious thing.  Was so goddamn funny.  For years, like, me and my brother had always done that.  The Bee Gees.  Talk like the Bee Gees and shit like that.  And to see you guys doing that was classic.  Dead on.  It's so silly.  What do you think?  Get a eat, me.  Get a eat, me, ladies and gentlemen. 
[03:16:00]  Like, imagine if Barry Gees.  And by the way, he's apparently the nicest human being.  He doesn't have a temper at all.  But we made him, like, totally as a maniac.  Oh, he's nuts.  He's like, don't you ever talk to me.  I am Barry F. again.  I survived the rapture.  I will put air holes up your butt and blow you up like a Macy's Day balloon and ride you in front of children.  What are you talking about?  It's so funny to have him that angry.  He should never.  He's the nicest Australian man on earth. 
[03:16:30]  He's back.  Now they're pounding on my ass.  I know.  They really want you out of here, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I love you guys.  Fantastic, man.  We didn't really promote it, but it's thank you notes.  Thank you notes.  It's a bit you do on your show, of course.  And it's a quick read, we were saying.  This is nice.  It's great for the bathroom.  Honestly, that's perfect.  You put it in the bathroom.  You read it.  I love bathroom books.  That's what they're perfect for.  Yeah, it's a good, like, graduation gift.  You've got to get something for a kid.  It's under $10, whatever.  I don't know what it is.  $37.95.  Oh, never mind. 
[03:17:00]  Never mind.  Well, that one's autographed.  Normal ones are cheap.  You get a Kindle version for them.  You've got to find it in his Amazon account.  But it's a good gift.  And it's like, I think it would be a fun thing to just pass around the table.  Everyone gets to read a joke and get it.  Yeah, sure.  Give Grandma a laugh.  It's a fun thing.  Okay, good.  $12.  Just a dozen bucks.  I can't believe you've got to go.  A dozen of them.  You've got to go, huh?  He's so busy.  He's a promotion machine.  I want to come back.  I mean, yeah.  At one point, I wanted to come back and do a whole week with you guys.  That would be awesome.  It's a friggin' rule.  I mean, that was...  It just hangs.  It just hangs. 
[03:17:30]  It just hangs and just do stuff.  Well, let's work on that.  Let's do that.  And you guys got to come back on the show.  I'd love to, man.  We want to do a bit, though.  All right.  A bit.  You want to do a bit?  I'd rather do a bit.  Really?  All right.  And sit there and talk about nonsense.  Just to do something stupid.  I love talking nonsense.  All right.  You know, I'm always bothering people on the streets of Manhattan.  I'll figure something out.  A bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's do a bit.  Whatever happened to that one thing?  Remember you did a bit with a dollar?  I'm like, come on.  That would have been the best thing if you just let it go and someone picked it right 
[03:18:00]  up and went, here, I want my money.  Oh, that was genius.  I think I'm going to, when I hit 100,000 followers, which is going to, I'll throw another  dollar out there.  Fuck it.  I actually want to give the money away.  I want to give the $10,000 away.  How many followers do you have now?  Oh, you want to blow up my Twitter tonight?  Yeah.  OP Radio.  Let's do this.  Let's do it.  At OP Radio?  I'm only at 87,000.  But if you do me, you got to do Anthony.  It's only fair.  Yeah.  All right.  So.  Fine by me.  I'll write it down if you want to.  Yeah, write it down.  I'm going to tweet you out right now. 
[03:18:30]  I don't need the help.  You're good already.  Jimmy's kicking ass.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We'll write it down as I leave.  But let's all go with it.  You guys are awesome.  I appreciate all the support.  Thank you, Nose.  Please get this.  You guys are awesome.  I want to talk about Pop My Balloon with Tracy Morgan.  It's one of the biggest laughs I've ever had watching fucking TV.  It's the weirdest fucking bit.  I don't get.  It's so weird.  Dude, I don't know why.  We're all just in the writing room.  Have you seen Pop My Balloon with Tracy Morgan?  No.  I can't even explain how weird this fucking thing is. 
[03:19:00]  It's a weird thing, yeah.  Have you done more than one of those?  No.  Only that one with Tracy.  That was it.  Are you going to bring it back?  I think I might do it.  I want to see if maybe Beyonce wants to do it.  That would be awesome.  Tracy's fucking out of his mind.  You've got to see this bit.  It is the weirdest fucking thing.  And the song is kind of cool.  It's very 60s.  Right.  I was just pitching ideas back and forth.  And I was like, wouldn't it be fun if there was a 60s type of guy with a hot dog card just  coming in like, won't you pop my balloon?  And won't you pop my balloon?  And he's got a bunch of balloons or something.  And then Tracy comes down and he has a balloon on his crotch. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  He's wearing a white spandex outfit and he's wearing, he has blonde hair and a Fu Manchu.  And he's just dancing around with this balloon.  And then I pop his balloon and he gets all bummed out.  But it takes forever.  It's so silly.  There's no real point to it.  It's a real weird sketch.  But he loved it.  And then at the end, I put another balloon on his crotch.  It's one of the hardest laughs I've ever had.  It's a happy ending.  All right.  You guys are the best.  Now they're dragging you out of here.  Thank you, notes.  Jimmy Fallon.  With the Riders of Late Night.  Check it out. 
[03:20:00]  Good boy phone and a naughty boy phone.  I love your song.  Yeah, it's a hit.  Can you record that?  Do you have anything else to add to that song?  No, but you don't.  What do you got so far?  What happens is, when you have two phones, one is good and one is bad.  So you have a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone.  A naughty boy phone and a good boy phone.
