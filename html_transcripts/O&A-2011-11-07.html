<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a self-congratulatory introduction, boasting about their controversial nature and perceived success.  The hosts then embark on a meandering discussion about William Shatner's hair, speculating on the use of hairpieces, before transitioning to a *Press Your Luck* contestant who exploited a game pattern to win big, referencing a documentary about the incident and the producer's subsequent fury.  This is followed by a segment dedicated to Barry Williams’ "Brady Brunch" show in Branson, Missouri, at Yakov Smirnoff's theater.  A promotional video is played and mercilessly mocked for its poor quality, Williams’ hammy performance, and his demonstrably false claim of wearing the same jacket as Greg Brady from a *Johnny Bravo* episode. Opie spills coffee on himself during this segment.

Next, the show dissects a promotional video for Yakov Smirnoff's dinner theater, with the hosts (and guest Jimmy) harshly criticizing the video's production, the unappetizing food, and the audience members.  Detailed descriptions of the food and filming techniques are given, along with numerous derogatory comments about the audience.  Callers Larry (complaining about Branson parking) and Stinky (discussing low decibel limits in Branson venues) add to the segment.  The discussion continues, focused on the promotional video and the apparent low expectations of Smirnoff’s patrons.  A second segment, featuring guest Dennis, further lampoons the dinner theater video, focusing on the elderly audience, small meal trays (with their four embedded magnets), and Smirnoff's promotional style.  This segment also includes an offensive imaginary scenario of Smirnoff’s dessert reaction and a milkman call-in.

The show then shifts to current events: the Occupy Wall Street protests and the death of a participant at a similar protest in Vancouver.  The hosts express cynicism toward Mayor Bloomberg’s response and speculate about the protests’ origins, including whether they are organic or a staged event potentially funded by George Soros.  This discussion devolves into a sexually explicit and vulgar conversation with caller "Stump Brain," detailing sexual experiences and anatomy.  Allegations of connections between J.P. Morgan, the NYPD, and the protests are made, though not verified.  The conversation continues to be sexually explicit and speculative regarding the motivations behind Occupy Wall Street.

A lengthy segment follows, focusing on the show's intern, Matt, and his unusually large penis.  The conversation is extremely crude and sexually explicit, detailing sexual encounters, penis size comparisons, and sexual acts.  Matt's perceived arrogance and lack of sexual knowledge are mocked, with descriptions of his Facebook photos adding to the sexually-charged humor.  His travel habits, job, and new band are also discussed briefly.  The hosts briefly mention a Steven Singer Jewelers advertisement and speculate about the source of their silver.

The show transitions to a commercial read for Steven Singer Jewelry, followed by a discussion of Joe Frazier's declining health and impending death, using morbid humor.  The conversation shifts to Andy Rooney's recent death, revisiting past predictions of his demise and criticizing his behavior before his death.  A significant portion then focuses on the intense negative reaction to intern Matt, stemming from his on-air appearance discussing Occupy Wall Street and his penis size.  Callers express their dislike for Matt, highlighting his perceived incompetence and annoying behavior.  A caller recounts a graphic encounter with a large fish.  The segment includes discussion of the upcoming Ron and Fez show and the interns' reactions to Matt. Sam Roberts describes his visit to Zuccotti Park, detailing the poor conditions.  Audio clips of Joe Frazier singing and a comedic segment mocking Andy Rooney are played.  The Steven Singer Jewelry commercial is revisited.

The final segment begins with a humorous bit about Andy Rooney in hell, transitioning to a complaint about Andy Samberg allegedly stealing one of the host's Chris Humphreys impressions.  This leads to a discussion of the phrase "What's the haps?", tracing its origins to Eazy-E and Ice Cube.  The segment mentions ongoing issues with intern Matt, as evidenced by text messages, and mentions Club Soda Kenny.  One host announces an upcoming appearance on the Martha Stewart Living channel with Jennifer Hutt, anticipating negative feedback and Facebook attacks.  The show concludes with plugs for their Facebook page, live show, and the Ron and Fez show.  The unpopularity of intern Matt and the Martha Stewart appearance are highlighted.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony channel. 
[00:03:30]  XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beam from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What the hell are we living on?  It's the O.P. and Anthony show with O.P.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:04:00]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  It's the day over here, it's the day over here.  Stop with that shit, I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off, good morning to everybody. 
[00:04:30]  Why, why, why?  Why am I in Chinese?  Why am I?  Notice he never really intro'd it.  No, no he didn't.  He decided, you know what, I'm too big for this shit.  I was just kind of in front of the TV yesterday watching a bunch of old Star Trek movies.  Yeah.  One after another.  And boy, the many hairs of Bill Shatner was hilarious.  You have the big, over-the-top, poofy Pompadour from Rathacon, and then Search for Spock. 
[00:05:00]  He tamed it down a little bit, and then it came back again for the one where they had the voyage home.  Well, he's got it down pat now that he's 81, 82?  Yeah, now it looks natural.  Now it looks real.  It kind of looks natural now, right?  Yeah, it looks natural.  Didn't look natural for a while.  But that big, puffy Rathacon one is really funny.  That's a head of hair.  Yeah.  You think that's his real hair?  No.  When did he start losing it?  There were Twilight Zone episodes where you could see him thinning. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, really?  I swear to God.  How the fuck does he look like he has natural hair at 82 years old?  That he had a big head of hair.  Yeah, he has a lot of hair.  Is that from like the Texaco Star Theater?  Oh, boy.  Or something?  Oh, boy.  And then...  I don't see any balding.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, look at that.  Now that is the most ridiculous wig.  That's a hair helmet.  That is the most ridiculous wig he was wearing.  I think that's from the TV show Tattletales.  How do you know that?  I hated that show.  Hi, Jimmy.  How the fuck do you know that? 
[00:06:00]  I remember that.  What's his name?  Steve Garvey used to be on that show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it was them and their wives in the little television set.  And they'd get into little spats.  And it was fun for a kid to watch.  Like, oh, look.  2-12-1-9-4.  2-12-1-9-4.  2-12-1-9-4.  2-12-1-9-4.  You know, Jimmy.  I'm assuming, yeah.  I fucking watched the whole goddamn thing because of Anthony.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Gotcha. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  2-12-1-9-4.  They should have stopped the game because he kept going for the same two.  Yeah, yeah.  Yep.  Why couldn't he go 2-12-1?  2-12-1 every once in a while.  No.  Was the one going whammy?  He probably needed...  Yeah, maybe the one went whammy sometimes.  I think it was 2-12-1-9-4, and then they allowed you to try it yourself.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, this is fucking cake.  We're talking about Press Your Luck, where the guy just took the show for $107,000 in  one day.  What was 2-12-1-9-4? 
[00:07:00]  He labeled the board.  Yeah, numbers.  Numbers.  Gave each little square a number.  So he was just looking at actual squares, and then he could see the pattern.  And I think it was 2-12-1-9-4.  So he'd see 2 light up, he'd see 12 light up, and know he's in the pattern.  Right.  Well, and then 1-9-4.  But if he missed it the first time, would he go through it a second time?  Yeah.  Well, there were a couple different patterns, but he was waiting for the 2-12-1-9-4 especially.  Mostly.  That's why sometimes it took him a while.  It's like...  Right, right.  And sometimes he'd be like... 
[00:07:30]  And he'd hit it right away.  Yeah.  Because if he saw it right away, he'd know to hit it.  And then sometimes he'd have to get back into the groove of it, so he'd sit and just stare  at it, not saying big money, big money.  That was the one the documentary focused on, but he obviously was using another pattern  that hit the square to the right side, middle board.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Wait, that might have been...  It was the ones where whammies never came up.  2-12-1.  That was close to the nine square, but I'm not sure if it was the actual nine square.  You'd think they would have had whammies come up on every single square randomly.  You know?  It just seems to me... 
[00:08:00]  Well, it was 19, what?  84?  Yeah.  They didn't have that shit figured out.  Dummies.  They're dummies.  I liked it, though.  The documentary was all right.  It was cool.  Yeah, yeah.  It was kind of interesting.  It's one of those subjects that, you know, it's kind of a one in a million thing.  Right.  We were talking about it on Twitter, and, you know, as impressive as it was, the guy  still had to get on the show.  I know.  That's just it.  Right.  And then he had to get used to the button immediately.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  The button could have been a little quirky.  It was odd that he even got on the show.  Exactly.  And you hear the one producer, he's pissed to this day. 
[00:08:30]  Well, that was Bill's decision.  I didn't want him on the show.  Bill decided to have him.  I thought there was something a little, you know, off about him.  Right.  I think...  I didn't trust him.  I think his name was Bill that allowed him on the show.  Yeah.  That fucking other guy, though.  Still pissed.  He throws Bill under the bus.  Yes.  Yep.  That was Bill's decision.  He wanted him.  I didn't...  I thought there was something funny about him, and I didn't want him on the show.  And then them talking about during the show when they knew, but couldn't do anything about  it.  Right.  How long into it did they know?  Telling the host, like, holy... 
[00:09:00]  Pretty early.  Yeah.  Pretty early on.  They were like...  Because no one really went past, I don't know, whatever the number would be, but...  Yeah.  10 Gs, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  10 Gs and 10 spins without a whammy or passing it on.  When he was at 70, did they know?  Oh, yeah.  At 70.  Oh, yeah, they did.  But then they're like, we were concerned for his health?  Yeah.  That one guy?  I don't think they were.  The funny thing is, the guy that was on the show the same day, they allowed him to try 
[00:09:30]  it.  Oh, you saw the documentary.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And he went an hour without a whammy?  Yeah.  That must have pissed him off.  I know, right?  This is fucking easy.  Why didn't I figure this shit out?  He didn't think of it.  The other guy thought of it.  2-12-1-9-4, I think it was.  2-12-1-9-4.  I wonder how many people have had fucking scams for game shows, but just were never able  to get on the show.  Right.  You know?  You think about it, like, oh, how did this guy get on the show?  He's probably one of the guys out of a fuckload that had a system that just managed to also  combine it with getting on the show.  Because Press Your Luck was a pretty popular show, obviously, so it wasn't easy to get on 
[00:10:00]  the show.  So how the fuck did he get on the show?  He was right.  He had to know trivia questions and fucking have some personality.  Right.  Personality.  Yeah, it was fun to watch.  He beat the system.  So, William Shatner's hair and Press Your Luck.  Sorry.  Yes.  No, when you said Tattletale, it was in my head.  I'm like, fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to tell Anne, I saw that damn thing.  Tattletales.  Burt Convey hosted Tattletales with his little tight afro.  Yeah.  The other thing, you want to start with the Greg Brady thing? 
[00:10:30]  Poof.  Man, did you fucking, did you horrify me early on a Monday morning?  God damn.  I hope he just comes in and he's like, you gotta see this, fucking Greg Brady, what he's up  to.  And he used to be our friend.  We haven't seen him in a while, so I feel good we could do this today.  Yeah.  We love Barry Williams.  He's done our show many times.  Yeah.  Hopefully he'll do it again.  But he's doing something pretty fucking douchey.  It is.  He must, he must really have to pay some bills. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It's, it's so utterly bad.  He's got a stage show.  Yeah.  In Branson, Missouri.  Yes.  At the Yakov Shmiernoff Theater.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah.  I remember that.  We talked about that one time.  Yeah.  We talked about that.  We talked about it.  We didn't have actual footage.  Well, there's, there's a, uh, I guess this is sort of a best of clip that has made its  way through the internet because someone out there went, holy shit, this has to be on  YouTube.  It's like a little promotional thing.  Like, uh, maybe if you want to, uh, Oh, you think it's just a promotional clip?  Yeah.  I think if you're going to sell tickets through this thing. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Cause it's got Yakov's number on the bottom.  And I think if you're thinking about going to see, uh, Barry Williams as the real Greg  Brady during what he likes to call the Brady brunch, it's brunch at, uh, at Yakov's  theater with Greg Brady.  Let it go.  Exactly.  Let it go.  You might want to know what you're getting into.  So this is like a little trailer for what, uh, what happens there.  And, uh, I can't see you not wanting to just scoop up tickets to this.  A couple of things. 
[00:12:00]  What year did the Brady bunch go off the air?  Uh, 70, uh, 70, maybe I think it was 70, early seventies, wait 68, 70, 71, maybe  around like six years, right?  No, I think it was only like three years or something.  No, that whole show was only three years.  70, 74.  So that's five years.  I was thinking of Star Trek.  26, 30, 37 years ago, it went off the air and Greg Brady is now doing Brady brunch.  Still just trying.  In Branson, Missouri.  And, uh, Yakov, a, a, uh, media mogul. 
[00:12:30]  A mover and shaker in Branson.  We make fun of Yakov, but this fucking guy is getting money every time someone sits down  and watch the Brady brunch.  Or the Yakov-Shirnoff, uh, dinner, adventure dinner.  I think it was.  We'll see how well this goes and then we can maybe move on to the Yakov dinner adventure.  Seg into what the fuck goes on in Branson, Missouri.  Man, has that just got to be abominable.  So here's, uh, here's the clip.  It's like three minutes long and it is a doozy.  Yeah.  Let's, uh, start up. 
[00:13:00]  It's called Brady brunch with, uh, Barry Williams.  The real Greg Brady.  It's online.  Let it rip.  The Brady brunch.  And he plays this at the beginning.  The Brady brunch.  This is the part of the show.  This is on the big screen behind him.  Yes.  Of course.  That's good.  He kills a minute.  Yeah.  Oh, he kills a minute.  And now they play the Johnny Bravo clip.  Mm-hmm.  Where he puts the jacket on in the original episode.  Like perfect.  Righteous.  Did I tell you I never miss?  Beautiful.  You're not you anymore.  And I'll follow.  You are a superstar. 
[00:13:30]  Superstar.  And now it's done.  Superstar.  Now it goes.  Ladies and gentlemen.  To the stage show.  Mr. Barry Williams.  Oh.  Pause.  Oh, God.  And now you see Greg Brady.  He's on stage.  Barry Williams.  He's on stage.  And he's, and he's basically has that motion like, huh?  He's like standing like, huh?  All right.  Ah.  But he's wearing the jacket.  Well, he's not, though.  Like, it's a different jacket.  It's supposed to be kind of the same.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's, you'll see in a second, he's claiming this is the exact jacket.  But after seeing the original clip, it's so obvious that it's a completely different jacket. 
[00:14:00]  It's not the jacket.  Hit it.  Oh.  It still fits.  Oh.  Listen to the music.  Jimmy's stunned.  Listen to the music.  Jimmy's eyes.  Oh.  Listen to the music all the time.  What's he doing? 
[00:14:30]  He's singing.  He's so over the top dramatic in singing these songs.  Now he's in the Johnny Bravo jacket.  He's got the microphone.  He's tilting it up like, like fucking, you know, Vegas guy.  And he's attempting to hit some notes.  And he's trying to hit those notes.  Uh.  To listen to the music.  Uh.  And these poor musicians that have to.  If this was on SNL, you would laugh hysterically.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  But this is not, he's not being ironic.  He's being dead serious.  See, and they got the Yakov.com at the bottom where you can, uh. 
[00:15:00]  Order tickets.  Maybe order tickets for the Brady Brunch.  Who's going to that?  I don't know.  What's the option?  Like, do you want to do the Brady Bunch or?  Or, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Should we go to the Brady Brunch tomorrow?  I bet people are excited, though, down there.  They're like, oh, we're going to catch Yakov's show tonight.  The dinner show.  And then tomorrow we're going to do the Brady Brunch.  And then go back to the hotel room and fucking.  Well.  I'd rather paint dotted lines on my neck than go to Mexico. 
[00:15:30]  Nice.  You got to tweet that one.  That's a good one.  Oh, the Brady Brunch.  Well, he's still in the Johnny Bravo jacket.  And, uh, you're getting a full show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, this is great.  It's a bravo.  I.  I'm trying to get away from the whole Greg Brady.  Oh, a little commie.  A little commie, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  I'm happy when people just come up and refer to me as plain old Keith Partridge.  Got it.  See, because Keith Partridge was pretty famous at the time. 
[00:16:00]  It wasn't bad, but I'll tell you where he went wrong there.  Was he, he, he was, he did the talking after the punchline, which is like, it's like saying,  but folks.  But folks, let me tell you.  And almost like he was moving on, but then the laughter was so good he had to stop.  Well, the drummer, the drummer was already clicking on the hi-hat for the next tune, like in  the middle of his punchline.  Jones, he'll say, shut the fuck up.  Let me play this and get my session fee.  You cocksucker.  You might have to go to Branson and save Barry.  You might have to throw him in a van and get him the fuck out of there. 
[00:16:30]  You know what I'd love to do?  I would love to like, not tell him, I would love to buy 500 tickets and give them all  to Crips and Bloods and take that to the show.  Who's in the music?  If you fucking red and blue hats and sneakers been thrown at him.  Oh wait, we got a few more songs.  Oh yeah.  Hit this.  It seems to.  Gotta find my corner.  Gotta find my corner.  Gotta find my corner.  River of the Sky. 
[00:17:00]  Oh god damn, it's so over the top.  It just makes me sad.  It is sad.  He's in Branson in front of a bunch of old fogies.  Wait till you see the old fogies.  I probably watched this clip ten times over the weekend.  I couldn't get enough of it.  It's so uncomfortable.  I love it.  Do you think his singing is bad?  It's horrible.  Is it bad?  I can't tell sometimes.  It's that over the top kind of like.  It's average at best, right? 
[00:17:30]  It's average.  He obviously had some kind of training for breath control and shit, but he doesn't have  very good pitch.  But he does have all the moves down.  And he's got the, like he's too over the top.  He's putting on a show, like a Broadway show in Branson.  What you missed at the end of the clip that we just, that you heard, was he punching the  sky.  He's like punching.  The accent, that last note.  He's fist pumping and like he tips the mic way up and tilts his head back and puts that  arm behind him.  He's got all the poses right. 
[00:18:00]  Horrible.  Someone is saying this is part of a timeshare scheme.  Yeah.  J. North Carolina.  Nice.  The free show you get if you just sit in on our meeting.  It's an Amway meeting.  All right, here we go.  Throughout the series, as we began to grow and mature, my attraction to Marsha did not  diminish.  Oh, goodness.  And here is Marsha at her grooviest best and me trying to offer a little advice to her about  how to get out of a date. 
[00:18:30]  I need your advice about something.  Let me place clips from the show.  What's the easiest way to break a date with a guy?  Why don't you just do what we guys have?  I want to guess what he says.  Tell him dad has AIDS.  How did that work?  Just say, something suddenly came up.  Something suddenly came up.  That's all?  It always works.  That's what dad says.  Then he points to the front of his jeans.  He says, not his T-cell count. 
[00:19:00]  Something suddenly went down.  Hey, I'd like you.  It's all going to be AIDS jokes, of course.  Here we are on the AIDS train again.  Hey, I'd like to come down and enjoy your brunch.  Is that okay?  Go back.  Oh, really?  Well, he played the whole clip so he could get his line in.  Yeah.  His one lousy line.  It always works.  I never would have said that to her. 
[00:19:30]  Hey.  Something suddenly came up.  I never would have said that to her.  What does he mean by that?  I don't know.  Like, wouldn't he want something to suddenly come up?  Like, you got a boner looking at her?  Yeah, you would think, right?  You would think.  That would be the joke.  I wouldn't say that to her.  That would be the joke.  I know what he meant.  The bile that comes up for the audience when they hear that line.  And eat this hearted food at the Yakov Shmiernoff Theater.  Exactly.  They're all having a fucking buttered roll where the butter's hard.  Some horrible roast beef.  A continental breakfast. 
[00:20:00]  Too much fat on it.  It's the worst.  I hate the continental breakfast.  It fucking stinks.  It's not breakfast.  Don't try to cover it up with the word breakfast.  It's not.  I'd rather eat the fucking TWA Flight 800 dinner.  I'd like to come down and join you for brunch.  Is that okay?  Pause when he shows the crowd.  Look at this crowd.  The demo is like fucking 80 to 100.  And then there's a couple of younger people in there, but they're all these big, fat,  like, Midwestern trash that couldn't quite make it to Vegas. 
[00:20:30]  A lot of...  They got a Branson.  A lot of women.  A lot of unfuckable women.  They came there to see Greg Brady.  Yeah.  Come on.  So then he tries to brunch.  And then he talks to a woman.  He talks to a woman about the brunch, I think.  She's 90 years old.  Easily.  Oh, God.  This is delicious.  There you go.  This is delicious.  I asked all of the kids.  By that, she means her fucking...  Her fucking trach tube. 
[00:21:00]  Fucking rotten old cunt.  I hope she didn't make it out the front door.  This is delicious.  She was tasting oranges as she died.  This is delicious.  Stop, you're spilling it.  This is delicious.  She should say that when there's a fucking...  The fist of a young gentleman fucking crushing her palate.  This is delicious.  Be a fucking male nurse with a pillow over her face.  This is delicious.  It tastes like downy feathers. 
[00:21:30]  Brunch fucking food stain.  Looks like the Shroud of Turin on the pillowcase.  It's got gravy and fucking mashed potatoes.  Eyes.  She's vomiting the fucking cold potatoes back on the fucking pillow.  As he's belting out fucking wind beneath my wings.  Fucking fat guy with fucking dandruff in his beard.  Oh, somebody make a spilly.  Oh, wow.  Jesus, that's Obie's second spill of the morning.  I have a nice shirt on and it's all fucked up now.  Looks like that lady's pillow after the fucking oil I got to with her. 
[00:22:00]  Ob's white shirt.  I couldn't be happier because it has a big brown stain on it.  I couldn't have picked him.  Fucking Starbucks, let's drink.  Try me not to spill my coffee.  Why are they so drippy?  They're so drippy.  But then, I didn't even have the lid on this time.  I couldn't be fucking happier.  Just pour coffee onto my...  If that was lima bean juice, it would make me happier.  Jimmy wants a picture of Obie's horrid coffee stain.  That could be the greatest spill I've ever seen.  Hold on, I've got to turn my fucking camera on. 
[00:22:30]  All right, with the notices.  Fucking cock.  Don't you know you just push the fucking power button twice  and the camera comes on?  I tried that.  It's great.  I'm going to zoom in.  Holy shit.  Holy fuck.  I need a new shirt.  Like we're going to see people today.  See people.  Oh, well.  Where are we?  Yeah.  Oh, we tried the brunch.  So now it's back to some...  Try the wine.  Now it's back to some musical numbers. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Enjoying it.  I asked all of the kids to give me their footage  so that I could put it together  and create home movies.  I've set it to music  and it's a little glimpse of what we were like  off the screen and off the set  just being the normal kids that we were.  Oh, God.  That's a montage of them.  And that's all films that were taken when they were, you know...  Off set.  You could find this everywhere.  Oh, I know.  You can put it together.  No one put this together for him. 
[00:23:30]  It's been around forever.  Has it?  Oh, yeah.  I would say that was the only interesting thing  would just be to see them off camera.  Yeah.  Well, Mike Brady apparently,  the dad there,  gave them all...  Not a...  Gave them all...  Movie cameras.  Did he?  For like a gift.  And they used them all to take films  and I guess they're out there.  I'm pretty amazed by people  who had that foresight back in those days.  They should have had a little more foresight.  I know, really.  Too many didn't buy himself rubbers.  He should have doled out the cameras 
[00:24:00]  hoping fucking Mike Lookenlid  would snap his own cock by accident.  Fucking queen.  That's all he was doing.  He probably gave them to the boys  and the girls found out and got jealous.  And you put these by the toilet  when you're making wee-wee  and it'll help you go better.  Yeah, you put these on the floor  and you do jumping jacks over them.  Watch your little peeners bounce.  It must have been an ulterior motive. 
[00:24:30]  Of course it was.  He probably had cameras set up everywhere.  Got caught and said,  no, no, no.  I'm giving them out to the children.  I'm giving them out to everybody.  Just let me have the film that's inside of them.  All right, so home movies.  They stopped giving the cameras out  when Ann B. Davis left hers on  and they caught fucking Bubba Smith  fucking her in the shitter.  She's still alive?  I hope not.  She's always been old.  I'm not sure.  She has to still be alive.  I hit that.  You raise me up 
[00:25:00]  so I can stand on mountains.  It's going to finish strong.  You raise me up  to walk on stormy seas.  When I look back  I will recall  that moment of a moment  This was the moment  This was the moment  The greatest moment  Of the month  Of the month 
[00:25:30]  You couldn't just carry that note.  Is that what happened there?  There was a little trickery?  Yeah, you couldn't quite hold that note.  That was my weekend right there.  I had to watch that a few times.  Fucking hilarious.  It's amazing.  And that's at the  Yakov Shmirno Theater 
[00:26:00]  if you want to buy tickets.  I just want to know  what the Yakov Dinner Adventure  is about.  Can we hear a little of this?  I'm going to watch this.  This could be good too.  Is it like a commercial for it?  Mm-hmm.  What are people saying  about Yakov's Dinner Adventure?  It was a great show.  It's a beautiful show.  Yakov's Dinner Adventure  is a must-see show.  Come see why audiences  are raving about  Yakov's Dinner Adventure.  We are travelers  and we've been all over  to shows too.  New York, Vegas,  London, and Paris.  And this was probably 
[00:26:30]  one of the best.  Can you pause that button?  Yakov's show is one of the best.  Paris, London, New York.  That was the worst.  You know what kind of shows  we got here in New York,  you stupid bitch.  But that was the worst  sales job ever.  Instead of saying  this was the best,  I loved it.  She goes,  this was probably  one of the best.  She couldn't even commit  to it being the best.  And she's petting  her daughter's hair  because she knows  what she's saying  is just filled with lies.  She's pulling the kid's hair  like, don't fucking say it.  Don't say you enjoyed Wicked,  you motherfucker. 
[00:27:00]  Mama, you said this  torrible.  Torrible.  She was afraid  to kill us.  Mama, you say  piece of shit.  Mama, you say  Russian thief.  Russian thief.  Mama, you say  wrong Brady  get AIDS at the show.  There's a guy  in a unicycle  who gives a shit  eating that horrible food.  They showed a picture of it.  It looked awful.  Can we see the food?  Look at this. 
[00:27:30]  That's a nice dinner choice.  Stop.  A little parfait  for dessert.  Isn't that awful?  It's called bleckeroo.  Look at that muffin.  What is that thing?  A corn muffin?  I don't know.  What is the...  Mashed potatoes  they slop out of a big vat.  What's the gray shit?  What is that?  It's supposed to be meat.  It's the meat  that fucking chef  tried to cook  before he went  into the military.  It was gray.  It was gray.  All marbled.  And then there's  some chicken,  like broiled chicken.  Why would you need chicken  if you got the meat?  It looks like  the soles of shoes.  Look at that horrible muffin. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, that little thing  looks like a cockhead.  What is that glowing thing?  An egg next to it?  What is that?  It's a candle.  A little candle at dinner.  They bring the candle  on your fucking tray.  It's on the plate  next to the napkin.  That's a fire hazard.  That gray meat  should be sanitary.  That meat really bothers me, man.  Yeah, and that awful dessert.  It just looks terrible.  The dessert looks good.  It looks like pressed meat  because it's all perfect.  Yes.  Every slice is perfect.  Like a McRib.  The way they just press it.  But the color's really bad.  It's meat paneling.  You can actually line  your fucking basement with it. 
[00:28:30]  Fucking idiot  hasn't learned.  Wow.  You have to film food differently.  You don't actually film  the plate of food.  These rubes could give a shit.  They think it's great.  It's goddamn good food.  Great show, too.  Gotta spray water on it  to make it look juicy.  There's all sorts of tricks.  Is that what they do?  Oh, yeah, man.  You can't...  Food doesn't film well at all.  You put water on it?  Gussy it up.  They do all sorts of shit.  There's videos about it, yeah.  Yeah, they heat up those metal rods  and burn grill marks  into the burgers and shit 
[00:29:00]  to make them perfect.  Is that how they do it?  Yeah.  I didn't want to know that.  And then, like, beer and stuff,  they actually put, like,  whipped cream in it or something  because that makes it look  like a much better foamy head.  And they don't even cook  the burgers, by the way.  They make the patties  and chop meat  and they spray paint them  the brown color of meat  and then they burn  the grill marks in  with a hot poker thing.  Wow.  And, yeah,  the lettuce is really leafy  and just on the front  so it doesn't make  the whole bun pop off.  Well, you know,  if you put lettuce on a burger,  it wilts and looks like shit.  Yep. 
[00:29:30]  It still tastes all right.  So, of course,  the burger can't be heated up  if you want the lettuce  to look fresh, too.  Yeah, so they don't want  everything wilty.  All the clever ruse.  Yes.  Clever ruse.  And they can't wait  for it to cool off  because then the burger  will look like shit.  So they just never cook it.  That's a few of the tricks.  I forgot.  Fucked up.  There's a few others.  They spray paint the vegetables  to make them look, you know,  crisper and better.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no.  But stupid Yakov  doesn't know this  because his meat  looks horribly gray.  Look at that.  What a country.  Gray meat.  What a country. 
[00:30:00]  In Soviet Union,  we had meat  that was blue.  Aha, what a country.  Shut up.  He's making a lot of money, man.  For a fucking hat comic.  He figured it out.  But no one hears of him  outside of Branson.  You don't give a fuck.  I know.  Where is Branson?  Why did he pick Branson?  Missouri.  Branson, Missouri  turned into like this fucking  I don't know how.  I don't know the history of Branson,  but it turned into  the Vegas of the fucking Midwest.  Oh, is it?  Okay.  Yeah, it's a huge fucking place  that rubes go to. 
[00:30:30]  It's a low budget Vegas.  Yeah, like people from New York  and L.A.  You wouldn't be caught dead there,  but the Midwest?  It's perfect.  It's fucking giant.  God, I want to go there.  Are there hotels there?  Oh, yeah.  Hotels, shows.  They got like  what other places are there?  The Hollywood Wax Museum,  Silver Dollar City,  Whitewater Walsing Waters,  the Titanic Museum.  What other celebrity?  Ripley's Oddity.  Ripley's fucking Believe It or Not  stores blow. 
[00:31:00]  You don't like the Believe It or Nots?  I believe every one of them.  Believe It or Don't Care,  it should be called.  It should never be Or Not.  Believe It or Don't Care.  It's in here.  It's got to be real.  It's got to be real.  Ann-Margaret's down there.  What?  Tony Orlando.  What?  Wayne Newton,  the Oak Ridge Boys,  Barbara Mandrell,  Rich Little.  This is like  the Lennon sisters.  This is the 70s.  Right.  Everyone just went down there.  They all do Old Vegas, too.  Yes.  Lawrence Welk.  Petula Clark.  I don't think Lawrence is there anymore. 
[00:31:30]  Mel Tillis is there, at least.  Some of the younger.  They got Dick Clark down there.  Stop it.  What year is this?  Well, these are people  that have been associated  over the years.  Bobby Vinton.  Andy Williams.  Andy Williams,  who just announced  the bladder cancer.  Poor guy.  Kenny Rogers.  Gladys Knight.  Sands Pips.  Pat Boone.  Well,  you know,  they're not all  down there now.  They've just all been  associated with Branson  over the years.  But, you know.  You can't get a reservation 
[00:32:00]  in Branson.  What does that mean?  What?  Want to learn about Branson?  A little bit.  All right.  Hold on, man.  Let's see how to Larry.  Let's see the rest of that  fucking Yakov dinner thing.  Larry.  Larry.  Hi.  Hello, boys.  Hello.  My oldest brother,  his wife,  my mom,  and one of my other brothers  and nephew,  they went on the way  to Texas,  stopped in Branson.  Man,  the shows are expensive.  It's hard as hell  to get in.  I mean,  their places are packed.  They absolutely  pack them in  their places. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah,  I don't doubt it.  I mean,  you know,  think about what  a lot of the country is,  you know?  They love that shit.  I mean,  we're rubes.  I mean,  goodness sakes,  we live in the middle  of nowhere.  I mean,  we're rubes.  Rubes.  I can't help it.  I was born a rube.  I was raised a rube.  I'll die a rube.  And you went down there,  though,  and did you see a show?  I just haul freight down there.  I go down there  and pick up charcoal.  He can't get in.  He can't afford the show.  You can't afford the shows?  Well,  no,  it's not that. 
[00:33:00]  I'm in a big rig.  Where the hell am I going to put  my 18 wheels?  Ah,  well,  parking on Main Street  there in Branson.  Chuck has loved to talk,  though.  Yeah,  I know.  He's a little lonely  right now.  Yeah.  Thank you,  sir.  Yeah,  family.  Thanks.  Thanks for the family.  Jimmy.  All right.  Thank you,  sir.  Let's go to Yakov's  dinner adventure.  Let's see.  There's a Soleil in Las Vegas  and this was better.  Join us.  She's a short.  I'm sorry.  We're going to have to stop  this a bunch.  She might be telling the truth  in Vegas.  Stark was okay. 
[00:33:30]  In Vegas.  I've seen three of their shows.  They're fucking amazing.  I can't imagine.  Amazing.  I saw one in Disney  and I saw one in,  I forgot where else.  Oh,  the Bahamas somewhere  down there.  I didn't like the water  one as much,  but it was still amazing.  But you cannot fucking tell me  that the one in Branson,  Missouri,  during Yakov Smirnoff's  fucking dinner adventure  is going to be better  than the one in Vegas.  They're probably swinging  minorities from the ceiling.  That's why they all love it.  But stupid Yakov is making 
[00:34:00]  it sound like you see all  this during his show.  I think this is just  the general thing  of what you see.  Oh,  I think this is Yakov's  dinner adventure,  sir.  I think it is all exclusive  to Yakov's dinner adventure.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  It's under the banner  of Yakov's dinner adventure.  All right.  A lot of big acts.  Let's see.  This is probably one of the best.  I paid more to see Cirque du Soleil  in Las Vegas  and this was better.  Join us for a magnificent  show experience  and a mouth-watering,  fun-filled dinner.  Ew.  All right.  Could you go back  to the mouth-watering, 
[00:34:30]  fun-filled dinner?  I want to see.  It's horrible.  All right.  No,  they get the people participating.  It's the same food,  but he just rotated it.  He rotated the platter  a little bit.  That looks awful.  Like a muffin in the middle.  Could he, by the way,  have put it on a worse tablecloth?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  It looks like oldie  estate-type wallpaper.  It looks like the fucking rug  Nicholson was dancing on  when he got a little bit  of avocat spilled on his jacket.  Avocat.  Yes, it's the ballroom  fucking carpet. 
[00:35:00]  Of the Overlook.  Look at the tiny tray.  And then, you know what else?  It makes me uncomfortable.  They probably got to show,  by law,  they have to show  what you're going to get.  Yeah.  They give you water  with a slice of lemon.  Yeah, well.  No beverage.  Well, that's where  they make their money.  On beverages?  I would bet money.  It's 40 bucks a clip  for this fucking thing.  I would bet money, though.  No fucking wine or beer.  No.  That's separate.  Beer is $300 a glass.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  What the country.  What the country is right.  Let's see what happens  with the, uh...  Because I think I saw  some audience participation,  which is the best part  of any show. 
[00:35:30]  Or maybe that's a big  fucking glass of vodka  so you can sit through this shit.  Yakov, being Russian,  would love his vodka.  Vodka.  Vodka.  Vodka.  All right, let her rip.  Let me see.  Fun-filled dinner  that you and your family  will never forget.  We love the patriotism.  I want us.  Go to America!  All the shows we've seen,  this was one of the best.  Well, we came back  a second time.  It's a new breath  of fresh air in here.  I think it's wonderful.  I think the Moscow Circus  gave us a chance 
[00:36:00]  to laugh,  participate with audience  participation,  with balls and the balloon,  and brought a tear  to my eye at the conclusion.  I just had so much truth to it.  It was wonderful.  Oh, what an incredible story.  It was right there.  Oh, my God.  And they're doing it  in front of the Statue of Liberty.  Yes, with an American flag.  So uncomfortable.  This is so douchey.  Imagine having to sit  through this shit.  These fucking boobs  all think it's patriotic.  Yeah, this forced patriotism.  A breath of fresh air.  There's no fucking way.  It's just a bunch  of 85-year-olds  just farting.  Yeah, fresh air. 
[00:36:30]  Farting out that  bad meat farts  from Yakov's platter.  How horrendous  the farts are in that place.  Oh, God.  There'll be a breath  of fresh air  of fucking tsunami  coming through.  This is terrible.  Let's see what else happens.  This is what we have  to look forward to  when we get older, right?  Yeah.  This shit is.  This is what's going  to happen.  Oh, my God.  It's the Osmond brothers.  But you've got to think  that there was a time  they were young  doing their thing  and now this is what  we have to look forward  to when we're older, right?  Yeah.  Fuck.  The whole story  was an emotional thing 
[00:37:00]  for me.  I mean, I just got  literally tears in my eyes.  I was expecting  good Russian dancing  as it was wonderful,  but I wasn't expecting.  Pause it, please.  Oh, boy.  The Osmonds.  That man's head  is being attacked  by a carpeting.  Now, there are three  of the Osmond brothers there.  Two of them  are completely white hair.  Well, they've decided  to let time do its thing.  And the one looks  exactly like Donnie Osmond  as an old guy.  Yeah.  That's creepy.  There's one on the left,  though, that refuses.  He's wearing the worst wig 
[00:37:30]  ever.  It's terrible.  Ever.  With the darkest color.  I don't even think  Just for Men makes that.  I know.  No.  Who the fuck  did he get that color?  That is a wig  on his head.  The famous soy sauce,  I guess.  Yeah, soy sauce.  He's got a goatee  that is fucking dark.  Yeah.  That color is  black squared.  What a fucking horrendous  rug that is.  Horrid.  He's got to be  at least 65.  Yeah.  What is he doing?  His brothers are doing it right.  Just letting fucking  time do its toll. 
[00:38:00]  I got a tear in my eye.  In my eye.  I realize how much  I paid for this garbage.  By the photogs.  Through your tears.  Through your tears.  That's stupid  Bruce Kelly.  I can't help it.  But what I wasn't expecting  that it just blew my mind away  was just the effects.  You know, the fire,  the bubbles.  You decide.  Pause right there.  There's a big drop off.  Didn't he just say  the effects?  The grown man said  the fire  and the bubbles. 
[00:38:30]  They couldn't.  The effects  that they showed  were the smallest bubbles  ever.  It was a little flame  of like flash paper  on the stage  and then somebody  blowing bubbles  out of a fucking  big hoop  on the stage.  Those are effects.  No, it wasn't a big hoop.  It was a little hoop.  Make sure you pause  when the bubbles pop up.  But what an idiot  to say in the bubble.  Who says  and the bubbles.  That was the second thing  that came to mind  with the effects.  Fire and then the bubbles.  They should be saying that  when these three  are taking a bath  what's coming up  from his fucking  mouth and nose.  As the water's  turning black 
[00:39:00]  from his wig.  It says the effects.  The fire,  the bubbles.  That's tiny bubbles.  That's the worst.  Jesus.  What is wrong  with these people?  Who is going  to this?  Who would edit this  and go,  yeah, we're talking  about the big special effects  and then they leave  the little bubbles  in.  The bubbles.  It's a guy  just with a regular  bubble thing  that he just blew.  The bendy pencil.  Right.  When he has the pencil  between his fingers  I thought it was  a rubber pencil.  This makes the fucking  Greg Brady show 
[00:39:30]  look like Siegfried and Roy.  Oh, they're saying  it might be a dry town.  That's why no alcohol  with the dead.  What?  I'm pretty sure  Branson's a dry town  Tommy says.  Are you kidding?  Let's go to Tommy.  Well, it's probably  like very Christian  down there, right?  I would assume  a lot of Christianity  and personality  patriotism.  Uh, Tommy.  Hey guys, I got dragged  there.  I was abroad for the year.  My parents booked a vacation  when I came home  and I got dragged  to Branson, Missouri  to places effing dry. 
[00:40:00]  It's dry, huh?  Yeah, I'm punching out  boys.  All right.  No, they are not  a dry city.  I just looked it up.  They're not.  Is Branson, Missouri  a dry county  as you can see  as in  can you have  or do they serve  alcohol in Branson, Missouri?  Answer.  No, they are not  a dry city.  Okay.  So they're a dry city?  No, they are not.  But he said it was.  It says that.  No, they're not a dry city.  They are cracking down  on the liquor stores  for selling alcohol  to underage drinkers  but they are not  a dry city. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Let's, uh, let's, uh...  Oh, please, please.  I need more.  Yakov.  Unicycle.  All right, a unicycle.  And what was that thing  that was going  that was the human slinky?  Unbelievable.  My favorite part  was the human slinky.  Our favorite part  was the slinky.  Yay!  Yeah, the human slinky  was just amazing.  What's amazing?  I'm passionate  about this show.  I love what I do.  It looks like  a prolapsed asshole.  You know what?  The human slinky is.  It's...  Us in the air conditioning 
[00:41:00]  business, no.  That is what is called, uh,  about a 16-inch diameter  flex pipe  that you use  to, uh, connect  your return grills in.  And you crawl inside it  and flap it around  like your arms and legs.  And that's it.  That's it!  And it's spray-painted  rainbow colors.  To make it look  like a slinky.  Yeah, but it's not.  It's pretty amazing, Ed.  No, it isn't.  I agree with the...  It's the most...  I agree with the  Osmond brothers.  It's pretty amazing.  It's the most unimpressive  bit of, like,  that wacky kind of  stage weirdness  that you go like,  wow, that looks weird.  How do they do that?  It's way better 
[00:41:30]  than the Blue Man Group.  No, I don't think so.  I fucking hated  the Blue Man Group.  What do you think  of those apples?  On the fucking PVC pipe.  Was that the Blue Man Group  or the other ones?  Blue Man Group.  Oh.  They do that.  That's how much I hated  the fucking show.  Let's look at their  dumb fucking human slinky  that everyone's  fucking creaming over.  I love what I do  and when we created  this show,  we want to touch  all five senses.  And when I say 
[00:42:00]  five senses,  I mean smell  and taste too.  Oh, that's so far.  Because when we  saw...  Back to the stupid dinner.  Now they're showing  the horrible dinner again  as part of the smell  and taste.  And they decide  not to rotate  the dinner this time around.  No.  The same shot  from the second shot  of the dinner plate.  What is that little  white cup thing  with green stuff?  It's cum.  It looks like  a semen sample.  Bukkake.  It's dumb.  It's soup.  It's that...  I think it's that  broccoli cream soup.  You turn to your neighbor  and heave it on their back.  Do you think that's...  That is a tiny tray, 
[00:42:30]  though, isn't it?  It's the smallest  cup of soup ever.  It really is.  Look at the silverware.  You can tell  how small everything is.  Get a thimble of soup.  Forty bucks.  You're getting that  and that wonderful  entertainment.  With the horrible  vegetable medley.  Wow.  Nothing worse  than a vegetable medley.  I hate fucking  vegetable medley.  I hate the medley.  There's nothing  medley about it.  It sucks.  Someone tells me  they're opening  a lot of cellophane bags  in the kitchen  down there in Branson.  A lot of fucking  plastic bags  are being opened.  And that horrible  gray meat again. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, the gray meat.  Stop showing  the horrible dinner  and trying to make  believe it's fun.  Didn't they call it fun?  I would just eat  the mashed potatoes.  A fun-filled.  Fun-filled dinner.  Jimmy, what's a  fun-filled dinner?  Because they keep  using that phrase.  A fun-filled dinner  is sushi and a blowjob.  That's fun-filled.  That's fucking full of fun.  While you're eating  the sushi.  As soon as you burp,  as soon as you're done  burping and you cut  your first raw fish gasser,  that's a fun-filled dinner.  Yeah, you go up to the sushi bar,  you put your dick through  the hole that they provide,  have a few pieces,  as you get blown. 
[00:43:30]  That's fun-filled.  Being full-filled by  the sushi chef.  Fun-filled.  That's fun-filled.  Not this horrible  fucking plate of food.  All right, we're  halfway through.  Okay.  This is the longest  commercial for  Jakob's Dinner Adventure.  Well, this was supposed  to be about Greg Brady,  but we found another  nugget of gold here.  Oh, yeah.  Anything in Branson.  The Jakob Dinner Adventure.  Go ahead.  For our dinner,  not only our performers  will be dancing,  but your taste buds  will, too.  Ah!  The food.  Ah, your taste buds  will be dancing, too,  not just the performers. 
[00:44:00]  Looks like he hires  a lot of Russians, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  He brought them all over.  The Russians employed.  Former KGB.  Mm-hmm.  Will, too.  The food was wonderful  and very much worth the price.  The food was fun.  I claimed my plate.  It was much better  than I expected  and it was nice and hot.  I don't know how you did it,  but it was great.  Hold on, pause that.  What?  This woman is awed  by the fact that  the food was hot.  Where do you live,  you cunt in Igloo?  She's not expecting much.  She didn't set her sights high  so she wouldn't be disappointed.  What did you expect?  Donkey shit on a plate? 
[00:44:30]  But once again,  a guy did all the interviews  and he put this together.  Why would you leave the part  where she's amazed  that the food was hot?  I don't know how you did it.  An oven?  Yeah.  You dummy.  How boring is your place  that you're leaving that clip in?  Not many of the brothers  down there  in the shows at Branson.  Oh, no.  I see a common theme.  White people.  Old white people.  She looks like a fucking  grown-up Oliver  from the Brady Bunch.  What an ugly woman.  She really is.  Two weeks.  Getting more info here.  Stinky in North Dakota 
[00:45:00]  looks like ND.  Yeah, Stinky, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How y'all doing?  Hello.  Yeah.  Shit, I used to take  country artists over to Branson  all the time  from Nashville on the bus  and you walk through here,  it's total blue hairs  and the DV level in there,  the limit is ridiculously low.  I mean, you gotta,  you can't make a single sound  because it'll pop  all the friggin' hearing aids  and stuff.  Ah, so you gotta keep  the fuckin' volume way down?  Oh, absolutely.  I mean,  you stand in front of a house  and I don't know what it is,  like 90 dBs at the port 
[00:45:30]  is all they allow it  and you gotta whisper  to the fuckin' guy next to you.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Holy shit.  Oh, Conway Twitty  died in his bus  leaving Branson, Missouri.  Oh.  You know.  Wow.  Conway Twitty.  Do you blame him?  Well,  I'm gonna blame my own mortality.  Once you're in Branson,  I mean,  you know,  what else is there?  There's nothing else to do.  Yeah.  All right, boys,  I'm punching out.  Have a good day.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, right.  You guys wanna go back to this  or are we done?  Oh my God, yes.  Yeah, I gotta see this.  Oh, you got the yuck off menu? 
[00:46:00]  Ah.  It's called Creamy Country Soup.  Ah, that must be.  Smoked Beef Brisket.  That's the gray meat.  Ah, Grilled Breast of Chicken.  That's that fucking shoe leather  with hash marks all over it.  Buttery Mashed Potatoes.  Mm.  Sautéed Vegetable Medley.  It is the Vegetable Medley.  Why wouldn't it be?  The Sweet Corn Muffin.  They're using these dumb words that,  oh God,  it's so hack.  Scrumptious.  Scrumptious Strawberry Shortcake.  Old people love the word scrumptious. 
[00:46:30]  They sure do.  Oh, this is scrumptious.  And then they use the word refreshing  for refreshing bottle of water.  A refreshing bottle of water.  This fucking cunt gives you a bottle of water  for your $40 goddamn dinner?  Hey, it's refreshing though.  Yes, as opposed to the other water  in the other casinos,  which is murky and dismal  and full of cancer cells.  This one refreshes you.  It's refreshing.  Fuck yuck off.  You splash it in your face  when you fall asleep during the show.  When the old people faint  from low blood pressure, 
[00:47:00]  you squeeze a bottle in their face.  We're up to the lady that just...  Don't beg.  I hate this lady.  She just showed her amazement  that they keep the food hot.  Yeah, Rewon, let me hear her say  that she's amazed by the hot food.  This is the promo video  and they had to leave this in  for some reason.  I don't get it.  I don't get it, but hit it.  I cleaned my plate.  It was much better than I expected  and it was nice and hot.  I don't know how you did it,  but it was great.  This is a fantastic meal  prepared for you by my purpose. 
[00:47:30]  He's showing the stupid plate of food again.  Yakov's got the platter in his hand.  He's wearing the Russian customary wool hat  like he's ready to do that dumb Russian dance  and he's wearing the Russian tea room waiter outfits  and now he's going to tell us  about the food himself.  Why?  The food looks shitty.  Oh, he's talking this shit up, dude.  You've got to sell it.  It looks shitty.  So Yakov's got to talk it up.  He's got the tray of food in his left hand  and he's using his right hand gesturing a lot. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  Here we go.  Fantastic meal prepared for you  by my personal chef.  You get beef brisket,  a chicken breast filet,  creamy mashed potatoes,  vegetable medley,  a sweet corn muffin  and a delicious soup.  This mouth-watering meal  served to you on the golden platter  with linen napkins,  real silverware,  and a fake candle.  He's selling the silverware.  He's sick of hearing real silverware. 
[00:48:30]  He's selling the real silverware part of it.  And why is his nose clogged?  And these plates don't have holes in the middle  so food will not tumble to floor  and plates pick up.  It gives a shit.  He's selling like the worst thing.  An actual bowl to hold your soup.  You don't have to have it ladled hot  into your cupped hands.  And you'll have water with  the whole glass has four sides  instead of when I was a boy  we have three sides 
[00:49:00]  and water spills.  Would spill out.  With real linen.  Real linen napkins.  Not like those concrete ones  we had earlier.  Or the ones made from baby placenta.  Which everybody makes smell like death.  This real linen  you can wipe mouth and asshole with  at the same time.  and share one napkin per roll.  And real silverware.  Wow.  That's a good selling point.  And he laughs at fake candle.  He starts laughing.  Oh really? 
[00:49:30]  I didn't hear that.  Oh.  So you don't get the fucking real candle.  Because it's all real  like the real silverware  and then he goes in fake candle.  Pause.  Hit.  With linen napkins.  Real silverware.  And a fake candle.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  And to top it all off.  Oh he's laughing.  I would bet  a lot of money  that he might  eat the food once.  Oh.  He don't eat that shit.  Put his stamp of approval on it.  Oh my god.  He hasn't eaten it since.  They need a fake candle  because Yakov had a dream 
[00:50:00]  that he's standing  outside his place  up in flames  with just  on fire old people  running out of the place.  Ah!  Calling lawyers.  Horrific pain.  What the country.  Well I'm sure  there's a lot of people  in there with oxygen  tanks and stuff.  Yeah probably.  You can't have any  open flames around the table.  And they're extremely dry  blue hair.  I mean you can't have  fucking candles  around that joint.  Some old broads  head fucking catches on fire.  How great would that be?  All that hairspray  they put in.  He does sound stuffy.  He sounds extremely stuffy.  Oh my god. 
[00:50:30]  He's very stuffy.  He's got a weird color  in his beard too man.  Yeah something's going on there.  Looks like he painted it on.  Yeah very very strange.  Hit it.  Alright.  Now it's dessert.  And to top it all off  scrumpt your strawberry Romanoff  which is a Russian version  of strawberry shortcake.  We take our food for  You notice how  he made believe  he was going in for a scoop  and then they cut it.  Yeah.  Cause Yakov don't eat that shit.  Yakov ain't eating that shit.  He don't eat that shit.  He goes back to his fucking room 
[00:51:00]  and there's just chicks  naked chicks and cocaine.  That's why he can't fucking  Wow we don't know.  Nah I'm just  I'm just painting a picture.  We're doing a bit.  They had to cut there  because when he  when he takes a bite  he probably spit it out  he goes  I don't  this tastes like  like cock of mousse.  He says scrumptious  but this tastes like  the foreskin of  angry mousse  when he released  cheese into foreskin. 
[00:51:30]  This not like Russian dessert  this foreskin of mousse cold.  Get this away from me.  They had to cut it.  Yeah they cut it  and went to the  Is this guy actually pissed off?  Let's see.  Dennis.  Yakov you're on the way.  Are you pissed off Dennis?  Who me?  Yeah.  No man.  No what I'm saying is  you guys aren't really  selling this too well.  What you're saying is  fresh air  Christianity  harmless elderly people  patriotism  fuck that son  I don't want that for me.  Wow you don't see the humor in this.  That's weird to me.  Well we're not saying that 
[00:52:00]  first of all we're not saying  hold on  You sold me on New York  I love the threat of terrorism  and hate fresh air.  Hold on dude  we didn't make fun of the fresh air.  We're making  let me finish  you got your point out  I can't believe this fucking guy  We made fun of the old people  Let me finish  and the patriotism  is not  I don't believe the patriotism  I think it's fake  It's false patriotism  Right  But what do you  what do you have to say about Brownson?  Let this guy speak  Yeah  Okay  What I'm saying is  you guys are selling it  like New York  is the place to be  I mean  No we never compare that 
[00:52:30]  We're talking about Vegas  I do think you're going to get  a little more culture  I do think  I'm going to get a little more culture  in New York  You got to break it down to basics  We see this silly fucking clip  and we're just goofing on it  And Christianity  you know what  good for Christianity  but no one thinks fun  when they think Christianity  That's true  No one thinks  Christianity  Oh cool  That's entertainment  What time does the party start?  Yeah  Dennis  Are you listening to the clip itself?  Isn't it kind of silly  and something that should be made fun of? 
[00:53:00]  It is  I would never go to Branson  ever  Well then why are you complaining about?  He's more bashing New York  I wasn't complaining  He's more bashing New York  as a tourist place  I'll be the first one to  Oh my god  I'll be the first one to say  when I don't need to be here anymore  I'm not going to stay in New York City  I don't like it  I don't like New York  I don't like living in New York at all  I love it  I'd be the first one to admit that  New York's the best  I hope fucking Branson blows out of the ocean  It's the fucking best city in the world  It sucks 
[00:53:30]  I might even be in New York arrogant  It's great  I wouldn't mind visiting  and maybe having a little place eventually  but I don't want to fucking live here at all  Dude I never  Fucking hate it  I love it here  I fucking hate it  Love  Well thank you sir  Fucking hate it  Thank you  We understand  He didn't like that we were making fun of the Christian  He thinks that his Christianity or whatever  with the patriotism  Oh my god  We're just goofing on a dumb clip  Branson could be the greatest place in the world  I don't know  and I don't care to find out  I want to hear Yankov talk about his dessert more  Oh sorry  And have the people  Now he talks about the kitchen  and we get to see inside the kitchen 
[00:54:00]  And remember it's his own private chef  My own private chef  You think his own private chef is sitting there  fucking slopping this shit out for the old people  No  No  Hell no  We take our food preparation very seriously  Everything from the corn muffins to the brisket  is prepared right here in our very own kitchen  I don't know where else would it be prepared  My personal chef and his team  Oh it's big A's  Can make up to 1,800 meals in a single show  Some people ask 
[00:54:30]  How can you eat dinner in a theater  No one asks  Since there's no table  Because there's no entertainment to distract you  So while you're watching people jump like fools  you can eat without worrying to applause or laugh  Okay  My god  I just heard something  I heard it too  This could be  This could be great  This could be great  See I thought  I gotta give it away ahead of time  I was very  Extremely uncomfortable by the tray  The tray  Because everything is squeezed onto the tray  You feel like 
[00:55:00]  You feel like you're in a hoarder's house  There's no room for anything  Now this  Rewind her  And let her say what she just said  How could you eat dinner without a table  Listen to this  Listen to this  Single show  Some people ask  How can you eat dinner in a theater  Since there's no table  Oh no  You have to put that shitty tray on your lap  Precariously balance that fucking thing on your lap  It's the tiniest tray ever  That's what the fucking  Oh  Oh do these little fold out things 
[00:55:30]  No  I'm sure you just rested on your fucking  Well she'll probably explain  She's gonna explain  But you  Oh my god  People are spilling food left and right  You know why  Because then they could just come in  And sweep the floor down  And get another show going  They don't have to clean tables  They don't have to  Worry about tables and chairs  Nothing worse than when you have to eat your meal on your lap  Well what do they do  But what do they sit on  Are they just chairs  We're gonna find out  What do you think  Fists  I don't know  But this sounds like so fucking bad 
[00:56:00]  Forty bucks  No table  Blimey  She's gonna brag about the tiny tray I think  Yeah  That's definitely it  Alright let's hear  Come on  I'll show you  Okay  Show us  Oh it's like a theater  Actually we do have tables  No you don't  And they're custom goods  Just for our theater  Oh they flip out like an airplane  We have a little secret  There are four very strong magnets  Embedded in each table  It prevents sliding and slipping  The only way to really say it 
[00:56:30]  Pause my god  Pause why are they promoting the stupid fucking tray table  With the magnets  So you gotta sit there  In a theater seat  Like a movie theater seat  That has a fold out thing  Like an airplane  Like in the armrest  It comes out  And then sit there  And eat  Literally  Two inches away  From the slob next to you  Do you know how many fucking people  They're promoting it this way  This is this final selling point  Where you're like  Oh the four magnets  We gotta get tickets immediately  Four magnets  I didn't know they had the four magnets 
[00:57:00]  I thought there were three  I was expecting three magnets  I'm very impressed with Yacob's Theater  This place gives you four  Four magnets  Honey we gotta get tickets for the next show  We've been to so many two magnet places  And the tray slipped and slid all night  Do you know how many old people  Must be cutting the meat  And the tray flips on the floor  Yes  So they finally had to come up  With the magnet system  And you're just hitting elbows  With some geriatric fucking disgusting slob  Oh man  Fucking getting old's gonna suck 
[00:57:30]  Yakov  Fuck  You think Yakov sits down there  In those chairs  And eats on his fucking four magnet tray  No he's having his sinuses fixed  Oh god  But half the video is this lady  Fucking promoting the magnets  I'd love to see the fucking magnets  Pull an old bag's bridge work  Right out of her mouth  Bang  It just fucking  Flies out of her face  Onto the tray  They're just addressing  What they know  The old people watching this  Are gonna be asking  Exactly  And if people come  And they have too much melanin

[01:20:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:21:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:21:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:22:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:22:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:23:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:23:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:24:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:24:30]  We like to get topical every once in a while.  Yeah, coming back for break with a song that usually means something.  Yeah.  Yurok, why the Joni Mitchell today?  Well, Joni Mitchell is 68 years old today.  Who gives a shit?  I'm getting topical with the sex man.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  That's so lame.  Got to make believe nothing happened last week. 
[01:25:00]  Joni Mitchell is 68 years old today.  And Christopher Knight is 54.  And Christopher Knight is 54.  Wow.  We did a little Brady Bunch action earlier.  Yes.  That's fascinating.  Phil Packer.  And fucking...  You know what?  You should have done an AIDS thing.  Because Magic Johnson announced he tested positive for AIDS 20 years ago.  20 years ago, huh?  When people were dropping like flies if they had it 20 years ago.  That guy will die of old age before he dies of the AIDS. 
[01:25:30]  Where the fuck does he get his medical treatment from, man?  Well, now is one thing.  But where was he getting it back then?  No kidding.  Well, he had the money.  He was also in peak shape, too.  I mean...  It goes to show you.  It makes you suspicious, though, man.  If you're famous or have a lot of money, you're getting...  Well, you're going to get better health care.  That's for sure.  Much better, though, is what I'm saying.  It's shit that they don't want to offer anybody else, it seems.  I got my suspicions.  You watched football yesterday, Ant?  No.  Not a big football guy, are you? 
[01:26:00]  No, not really.  There were two great games on for me.  The Jets beat the Bills 27-11.  Yes, I did hear that.  And the Giants beat the Patriots.  Now, that wasn't supposed to happen.  Patriots haven't lost at home in a long fucking time.  I think it was 30-something games.  Damn.  And the Giants beat them 24-20.  Yes.  Wow.  Two really good games to watch.  What was the problem?  What was Pat's problem?  Oh, God, fuck. 
[01:26:30]  I don't know, man.  What happened to Brady?  It was a boring-ass game.  Some people would be, it was a defensive battle.  Oh, that'd be a boring game, yeah.  It was fucking no score at halftime.  And then all of a sudden, there was 44 points in the second half,  so the second half was pretty exciting football.  But they shut down Brady?  Is that what they did?  No, not really.  No.  Brady, how many yards did Brady throw for?  Anyone know?  Two, three.  Yeah, I would say close to 300 yards.  Easy.  Jesus.  So, no, they didn't really shut him down. 
[01:27:00]  He was marching up the field when he had to,  especially in the second half.  Eli Manning had a fine last-minute drive,  and that's how they won.  Oh, okay, one of those.  I fucking hate that I had to root for the damn Giants.  And then someone goes,  what's your problem with the Giants?  I'm a Jets fan.  We live in a city where we're fortunate enough, I guess,  to have two New York teams,  but a lot of us just pick one, and that's it.  Yeah.  We don't go back and forth,  and we're not wishy-washy about it.  Hey, bro.  What about Buffalo?  Huh?  Buffalo's my secondary team. 
[01:27:30]  Everyone has a second team.  That's a New York team.  So, the Jets-Bills thing was a little rough.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would root for the Bills over the Giants  every single fucking time.  No problem.  27-11?  Yeah.  Jets.  Yeah, Jets beat them at home.  The Bills were at home, and they won.  Sanchez looked, you know.  If I ever feel so inclined, I'll pop the game on TV,  but for the most part...  You don't put it on in the background?  Nah, I don't even think about it. 
[01:28:00]  Why?  I have so much other shit to just put on instead.  Yeah.  That would entertain me.  Jimmy's Cowboys won.  They're still kind of in it.  They don't deserve to be in it.  They're shitty.  They're still kind of in it.  And I hope they fucking don't win it,  because Ramos stinks.  Well, they beat the Seawawks, 23-13.  Colts still have not won a game.  No?  No, they're 0-9 now.  Good for them.  They should just keep that going.  Yeah, why would you win a game?  It just wrecks it for everybody. 
[01:28:30]  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, that's hilarious.  Wow, wow, wow.  The fans are attacking Yakov Shmiernoff's Facebook page.  And they're putting some...  There's an amputee woman spreading her asshole,  gaping her ass.  Yeah.  You see little Jimmy Norton pictures up there.  It's Yakov's Dinner Adventure Facebook page.  Yakov Shmiernoff Theater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Facebook, and then Yakov Shmiernoff Theater. 
[01:29:00]  Oh.  For the record, we didn't tell anyone to do this.  No, why would we do that?  We can't control these fucking assholes anymore.  It is kind of funny, though.  Oh, God.  It's Ted's ghost-frightening products emporium.  Emporium.  Yeah.  Well, lucky for him, he's going to be entertained.  Yeah.  By all these wonderful posts on his Facebook.  Okay.  Did you see the Sanchez flinch yet? 
[01:29:30]  No.  It should be on YouTube.  What is it?  They did one of those wildcat plays there near the end of the game, and Sanchez fucking  flinched.  A lot of people are laughing at this little clip.  Hmm.  But you don't watch football, so this is just nonsense.  Yeah, I could appreciate it.  Oh, by the way, the other team that didn't win a game all year finally won, and that was  the Dolphins.  So there, watch this.  There was no foul at the end of the play.  There was holding by the offense number six. 
[01:30:00]  A 10-yard penalty will be enforced from this.  All right, why would you have this on your video?  First down.  Well, I can think of some better things that Mark Sanchez could be doing for three minutes  to go in a 16-point lead than making...  That was awesome.  He flinched, and he is going to...  You see that?  And then why'd the guy run and scare the shit out of fucking Sanchez?  Why is Sanchez, like, pushing him?  Awesome.  Well, they're nuts. 
[01:30:30]  And he is going to get this...  Oh, boy, this is funny stuff.  They're making contact.  Oh, the play was happening.  Yeah.  That was awesome.  At that point.  They flinched.  They're making contact.  Huh.  Why would you flinch like that?  You're in the NFL.  Yeah, a lot of people making fun of Sanchez today over the flinch.  That's about it.  Fuck it.  No one gives a fuck, so...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, y'all.  So, what, someone dropped dead at one of those Wall Street things? 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Occupy thingies?  That would be...  Yeah, we predicted two things in the last, you know, the last month or so.  Mm-hmm.  Last week, we said the only way the Occupy Wall Street thing would end is if someone died.  Yeah.  And I believe that's exactly what happened in Vancouver.  Drugs.  I know when someone died, and I think they shut it down because of that.  Yeah.  A young woman, right?  Yeah, I think some 23-year-old being...  She OD'd or something?  Doing some drugs.  That could have happened anywhere, though.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  And it will.  Yeah, but this is how you shut these things down.  You can't have people dying in your parks.  Yeah.  I heard they shut it down.  Is it true?  Is my knowledge right?  I don't know.  Who the hell was it?  She died, drug overdose, dead in one of the tents.  Yeah, correct.  Authorities are calling a medical emergency after she stopped breathing in a tent.  Oh.  Yeah.  Drugs.  Yeah, I heard she died, and then they shut down the Vancouver one. 
[01:32:00]  If someone has knowledge that's different, please let us know.  Yeah, that's what happens, whether it's murder or drug overdoses or shit like that, assaults.  If somebody dies, they've got to shut it down.  Yeah, of course.  Although, now I heard on the news, even before you said something, that they want to bring  in this giant tent, like a big top.  No, they did.  I was down there Friday watching them put it together.  They put a tent together that is as big as this room.  Yeah.  And, you know, this is a small fucking studio, but it's relatively big if this was out on 
[01:32:30]  the street, right?  Yeah.  And I guess it could sleep 18 women comfortably, so they have a safe place to sleep, so they're  not being groped.  Because it's a problem down near Wall Street.  What are they doing making it easier for people?  Like, it's about time they've got to fucking just clean it up.  Again, I liked what they were doing.  I liked the fact that these fucking scumbag executives, but to me, they're not hassling  the right people.  I think they should be on the front lawns of the guys that took the money. 
[01:33:00]  Misdirected bullshit.  They're not really bothering anyone in this park, the Zuccotti Park.  It's kind of out of the way.  It's not really in the...  Yeah, it's in the Wall Street area, but it's not on Wall Street or close enough where it  would be a hassle for people that are coming and going from Wall Street.  What a non-leader Bloomberg is.  What a non-fucking-leader.  You know how out of the way Zuccotti Park is from the actual Wall Street?  They're using the actual Wall Street to film some of the Batman movie while they're occupying 
[01:33:30]  the park.  So it just goes to show you they're not in anyone's way.  And now they got this massive tent so the women don't get groped at night.  They could sleep in there.  Sleeps 18 women comfortably.  That's it?  18?  I thought Mayor Bloomberg said no more tents.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah.  They were going to take everyone out of there, clean the park, and then they were putting  in new rules where you couldn't set up a tent or nothing.  They're just making it more difficult to end it by letting them bring more shit in.  There's easily 100 tents down there now. 
[01:34:00]  Easily.  He's a non-leader.  He's a non-leader with each other, too, man.  It's unbelievable.  He never did anything that was considered law and order.  Not one thing.  No.  He put in fucking potted plants.  He gave his middle finger to the middle class because he doesn't give a fuck that  they drive.  So he fucking cut off all the roads in half.  Because, again, he doesn't give a fuck about people who have to drive.  They're valueless to him.  And when it comes to something like this, he just can't pull the trigger.  A total non-leader.  Yeah.  He sucks.  And he fucking backdoored his way into a third term after crying about Giuliani. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Can't stomach him.  It's really confusing because there's strict rules in New York City.  I said it.  I'll say it again.  You can't even have a kid party in a park without all sorts of permits and stuff.  And these people are putting up these, you know, this past Friday, a massive tent.  It's because it's technically private property.  Oh, that's right.  It's the park isn't owned by the city.  And that's the sticky wicket.  Is that what it's all about?  Yeah.  But, I mean, at some point, even the owner of the property doesn't want them there. 
[01:35:00]  So I don't know how that goes down.  Do you call the cops?  Do you have to call your own private security firm to chase them out?  Or does he just not give a shit?  And then how does it affect the...  How does the city not own the park?  I know.  I don't know how that works.  That's confusing to me.  And then how does it work as far as after all this is done, if the builder, the guy that  owns the property, says get the fuck off, who does it? 
[01:35:30]  You know?  Who takes care of that business?  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then what are the police supposed to do?  Because it is affecting peripheral areas of New York around the park.  I got to tell you, man, like I've said, I've been down there a lot.  I don't see where it's affecting peripheral areas.  I'm sure it's not perfect.  And I'm sure a couple of places have suffered.  But there's a Starbucks a half a block away.  You go in there, there's no one in there.  There's a McDonald's across the street just doing... 
[01:36:00]  Maybe that's just it.  Or is it a Burger King?  There's no one in there.  People don't want to go near there.  But there's no occupiers in there.  Yeah.  No, I shouldn't say no one.  It's a regular Starbucks that you would see anywhere.  Just regular business.  I heard some business people were pissed off at the drum circle and making noise.  Well, the drum circle...  And they're trying to run a restaurant and you could hear the...  Well, they took care of that.  They're only allowed to play for two hours a day.  Yeah.  So then they choose which two hours they're going to do.  Two hours when, you know, maybe you want to have dinner during that two hours and you 
[01:36:30]  got to listen to fucking...  It's usually prime time.  Well, it's...  I don't know.  A lot of people just enjoy going down there because it's like a freak show.  Dude, there's hundreds and hundreds of people at any given moment checking it out.  Yeah.  What is the motive for letting it go on, though?  And those people have to be spending money in the area.  So I don't really see how it actually affects the businesses that much.  What's the motive for allowing it to happen?  I don't know.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  I just wonder if it's something we just don't know yet. 
[01:37:00]  Like, do they figure, okay, because all over the world, people have been rioting against  the government.  It's happening in the Middle East.  It's been happening everywhere.  So when they see it happening here, they might figure if this is as bad as it is, a bunch  of fucking rich kids sitting in a park pretending they're poor.  They have some little violence in Oakland, but it could be a lot worse.  Well, they're allowing it to have momentum, though.  So where does the momentum take this whole thing?  I think they're thinking winter will stop it, too. 
[01:37:30]  Where it gets really violent, you know?  You allow the momentum to continue.  This thing's going to get violent.  But winter ain't going to stop it, like in more climates.  No, they're already prepared for winter.  And, you know, this thing, if they keep giving them tents and other shit like that, there's  going to be people that hang out.  Well, you also could bring in one of these people for the winter.  I told you about that.  There's signs all over the place that you could have one of these people in your home for  the winter.  It's just become a city-sanctioned place for bums to go and fucking sleep. 
[01:38:00]  I should find a hot chick.  I'm going to go down there and say, look, I have a great apartment for a fucking hot  chick.  You must have meaty pussy lips and a little hair under your arms.  I'm just in a weird mood lately.  And the other thing is the paper is saying they got activities planned through the year  2025.  Oh, stop it.  Are they out of their minds?  I'm serious.  It's in the other paper there.  What activities?  I don't know.  Every day they have some kind of activity. 
[01:38:30]  Outdoor shitting?  Yeah.  Well, no.  They finally brought in the porta-potties, making it even easier to hang out there.  Oh, great.  Because that would drive me away from something like that.  Who's footing that, though?  I got to shit in the morning.  And if I can't find a turlet, that would make me go back to my warm fucking apartment.  Get the freezing cold porta-potty.  Yeah, but at least you got a place now, because when you go down there, I prepare, I make sure  I don't drink too much coffee and stuff, because it's not easy to just go and take a leak.  Yeah.  Even that Starbucks bathroom, it's obviously they have a bathroom, but they're trying  to tell everyone it's not a bathroom anymore. 
[01:39:00]  And I'm like, it's a bathroom.  I've been in a million Starbucks.  Closet.  Yeah.  Storage room.  Right.  So you got to prepare, because it is tough to take a leak down there, but now they made  it easy with the porta-potties.  That would have drove a lot of people away, don't you think?  Yeah, I would think so, but I don't know why they let him put it in there.  Why are they letting him do this?  I don't know.  I wish I had an answer for you.  We got someone we could talk to.  I could set it up for tomorrow.  Yeah.  Guy worked for the NYPD and stuff, so he's not some whack job. 
[01:39:30]  He's got some theories and some facts we don't have yet, if you want to listen to him.  I bet they're going to fucking, the guy that owns this property, the park, I bet when  they do try to kick him off, they're going to pull one of these squatters things.  It's like, hey, we've been here for a certain amount of time.  You allowed us, and we are filing for residency on this property.  Guaranteed.  The guy fucks himself by letting him do this.  Here's the problem as I see it, because I've been down there, like I said, I'll keep saying  it a lot.  It's the point when you try to move these people out of there, there's going to be a major 
[01:40:00]  fucking problem.  There will be bloodshed.  I'm telling you, these people have dug in, and now you come in and say, look, it's over.  I want my fucking park back.  There's going to be a major fucking problem.  They're not going to go away easy.  Occupy.  Wow.  Huh?  Occupy.  That word became the...  I'm in a bad mood today.  I'm just chill.  I bet if the owner of that property went down there and stood in the middle and just went, 
[01:40:30]  hey, by the way, I'm the owner.  You guys got to leave.  You really got to leave.  This is my fucking property.  You got to leave.  They would not listen to that guy.  They'd probably punch him in the face.  Yeah.  And it's like, no, this is my shit.  Yeah.  Leave.  Find another place.  Leave.  No.  Live.  No.  There'll be some kind of battle.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  They're ready.  There's guys down there that are ready to do some stupid shit.  They're just waiting for that moment.  I'm telling you.  There's a lot of people down there that are just not right. 
[01:41:00]  They're not right in the head.  Yeah.  Because they're fucking bums and homeless like we see all over the place.  But they're put in one area now.  They've gravitated to this whole thing.  And it still makes them these insane homeless people.  Yeah.  And, yeah, whether there's a few people down there that are protesting and have sound  mind and body, they're mixed in with kooks and lunatics and fucking disgusting people.  Plus, what you said, I think, last week, you said something like, you know, we've got 
[01:41:30]  to end the one in New York and that'll end it for the whole country.  Well, it's a little weak in it anyway.  Well, you cut off the head, whatever you're saying, right?  They're aware of that.  They're aware that this is really important to the movement.  Right.  The New York one.  So, I'm telling you, it's going to get fucking ugly.  I don't know when.  They've got the violent Oakland one, which is fun.  Right.  But, I mean, winter's not going to stop these people.  You've got to see these tents.  Yeah.  I heard on the news that they were bringing in, and you said they built one, but I hear 
[01:42:00]  they're bringing in a bigger one.  Look how big it is.  It's right there.  It's like a crazy circus tent.  Yeah.  That's like a mash tent.  Who's allowing them to put that up?  No.  That's the one I saw them build.  They can't.  I'm telling you, they can't bring in a bigger one than that.  Really?  Because they kind of had to move tents and shit away to make space for that thing.  How the fuck?  I used to, when I first went down there, you would go into Zuccotti Park itself, and you  could wander around very, very easily.  It's down to, at this point, if I'm correct, two, maybe three paths where people like squeeze 
[01:42:30]  them past each other because they want to check out what's going on.  It is really fucking tight.  Can they get to the library?  Yeah.  The library is still doing very, very well.  Thank God.  A lot of shitty books in the library, man.  I bet.  Those things are awful.  But you got a guy there.  You can't just grab a book.  You got to take it out of the people's library and then return it.  Ugh.  But now there's two to three paths that are really fucking, you know, narrow.  Yeah.  So it kind of sucks to even wander around in the park itself because it's a pain in the  ass.  I don't even. 
[01:43:00]  And now there's dead ends because people have set up so many fucking tents that you can't  even go down certain areas anymore.  I don't even see like that.  I would even fucking, I just don't even want to go down there.  Why?  Just as far as people watching, it's just anger me.  Why?  I wouldn't mind going down just to look.  I haven't gone down.  Why would it anger you?  Because I'd see a bunch of people that just fucking are assholes.  It's all right.  But can't you see past that?  You see that every day here?  Yeah.  True.  No.  No.  No?  I'm just, I'd probably get in trouble.  Take the subway down?  Yelling something at people. 
[01:43:30]  Take the one all the way down or what is it?  Rector.  Yeah.  Is that where you get off Rector?  Yeah.  Barely nowhere.  Yeah.  Take the one.  To Rector.  How far of a walk from Rector is it?  Two blocks maybe.  Maybe three.  Follow your descent.  Check out Trinity Church while you're down there.  It's stench.  It's beautiful.  It's a beautiful church down there.  A couple of them.  What happened to the mosque that was being built near Ground Zero?  That was the whole Con Ed bill.  Yeah.  Oh no, they were going to build it, but I think the Con Ed fucking thing. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  But it's not being built is what I'm saying.  It's not.  See, Buffalo, Rochester, and Erie already have tents and heaters up.  See, in other cities, they're kind of allowing the heaters.  Why?  I don't know.  It doesn't.  Something doesn't make sense.  Can someone call?  I mean, we have plenty of cops that listen to this show.  Why are they allowing it?  Like here, someone said it was a problem between the police chief and the mayor.  Well, they're allowing it.  The police chief's running to be mayor, so he doesn't want a big thing on his watch.  But they're allowing it here because, like you said, the park is private. 
[01:44:30]  So there's kind of a loophole there.  But you're trying to tell me these parks in every other city, they're all private parks?  It can't be.  No.  So it seems like these other cities could easily tell these people to move on.  Why are they allowing this?  That's what I don't completely understand yet.  I don't know why the owner of this property is allowing this.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't have an answer for you.  Intern Matt, Jesus Christ, why are you putting...  Now I'm in a bad mood.  I don't...  Now the guy from Patchogue is absolutely right.  Now I'm in a bad mood.  Well, intern Matt pipes up with this stuff and he acts like I'm purposely keeping him off the show 
[01:45:00]  as if it's a personal vendetta and not what's good for the show.  What did he say?  He has a conspiracy theory about it.  He believes that...  Bring him, man.  We should probably hear him out.  Jesus Christ.  I like intern Matt.  You know that.  Who doesn't?  Bring him, man.  Yeah.  Do you have any piped up in your ear?  Not just every other time he has.  And after the show, he asks why I'm not fighting for him more to get on the air.  So he's got a little take on this whole thing? 
[01:45:30]  I have to tell him it's because we don't want to do an intern Matt segment every day because  we go into intern Matt world.  There he is.  Yeah.  What's your conspiracy, Matt?  You've got to make it quick, though.  All right.  Well, I've had this feeling for a while that basically it's a social experiment in having  a bunch of people living in this commune together.  And like it's like a shanty town.  And, you know, you can see that when you're down there.  And it's like a social experiment in having people live together in this community. 
[01:46:00]  And the big thing is the food, because when it first started, like it was literally an  unlimited buffet.  And like you could.  Hold on a minute.  What happened?  What are you looking for?  Holy shit.  I thought a rat was nibbling on my leg.  What was it?  I don't know.  Was it the headphone cord?  Sometimes that gets me.  I know you think I might be going crazy, but it might have.  Has that happened to you?  I get the headphone cord sometimes, yeah.  Maybe there's some non-union work going on by your leg. 
[01:46:30]  Dude, that just creeped the shit out of me.  Has that happened to you before?  Yeah, yeah.  The cord for the headphones hits my ankles sometimes.  I'm like, ah.  I'm like, what is fucking nibbling on my leg?  Is it down there?  Headphone?  Yeah.  Sorry.  I'm really sorry.  That was really fucking creepy.  Go ahead.  So a social experiment.  The food was plentiful when they first started.  The food was plentiful.  And then as it's been going on, they've been rationing more and more, where now you wait  in line for like an hour to get rice and bread, and it's like fucking communist Russia. 
[01:47:00]  So my theory is that eventually they want to have it so rationed that people start fighting  over food.  And I think that's only one aspect.  I think there's other aspects of this.  Who's doing this experiment?  Well, you can go online and you can see that there's legitimate news reports that's being  funded by George Soros, who's a media muggle, that douchebag.  I'm not going to allow you to move on.  I've been down there.  The problem is the food used to be for just a few people, and now people come from everywhere 
[01:47:30]  so that they can't keep up with the demand.  There's not more people now.  There's so many more fucking people going for the food line.  Will you stop?  There's not.  This is why I fucking, I hate you.  I thought you said you didn't hate me.  Well, I don't.  No.  Okay.  For the radio purpose, I guess.  Okay.  No, you've got to stick to the facts.  I've seen it.  There's so many more people that are trying to feed because the homeless, the word is  out for the homeless.  Oh, my God.  All we have to do is get online.  We get some free food.  There's not more people.  It's always been like that. 
[01:48:00]  Since the beginning, there were homeless people coming down looking for food.  Not as many as now, bro.  Do you think that is?  And you've got the day timers, whatever you want to call them, that just show up for  the day.  They don't even sleep there.  And more of those people are coming down.  And it's also that cost goes up.  After a while, it becomes harder and harder to provide that many people with free food  when you start dragging it to weeks.  First week or two weeks, people don't see it dragging for as long.  I don't believe it's a big social experience.  I really have seen about the same amount of food.  And I've been down there.  I'm up to about 10 times, Matt. 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  And I always walk by that food tent to see.  And there's an Asian woman.  I know the whole fucking thing.  There's an Asian woman that's in charge of it.  And if you step on her tent, she's going to be really pissed because her tent is a mere  few feet from where she's slopping out the food.  And she constantly yells at people for stepping on her tent.  In the beginning, it was 24 hours a day.  You could go and you could grab as much food as you wanted.  And it was just a buffet.  And now they only give you a little bit of food. 
[01:49:00]  Like last time I was down there, I was like, hey, can I get this and this and this?  Matt, I got to interrupt you, but don't you understand that they realized there was an  issue, so they wanted to control it themselves.  Like, yeah, at first it was like eat as much food as possible, but then they realized that's  what everyone's doing.  And like, holy fuck, we don't have enough food for this.  So now we got to like, you know, come up with some kind of structure.  That's all that is.  I think there's something more to it.  There was a lady the last time.  Sam, you were down there Friday.  Did you see the Ben and Jerry's lady? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, she was giving out a dulce de leche and chocolate chip for everybody.  But she's yelling, Matt, and this goes against what you were saying, and Sam could absolutely  back me up.  She had a huge tub of Ben and Jerry's ice cream where her fucking half her arm was filled  with ice cream because she's digging in with the scuba.  And did you not hear her go, last chance, who wants Ben and Jerry's whatever?  She said going once, going twice, as in like, I can't give enough of this stuff away.  So it goes against your point. 
[01:50:00]  It was a special treat.  But if they're rationing the food, they would be rationing the ice cream.  So why is she desperately trying to like scoop it out?  How many portions did you have?  Yeah, they were rationing the strawberries.  They were calling my underwear old brown stains.  Why would they be doing it when most of these kids, not all of them, but a lot of them are  privileged?  They're not legitimately poor.  You're not going to starve anybody out of there.  Like, I don't understand what the purpose would be when everybody down there can afford  to go and eat.  Yeah.  Except for the homeless people. 
[01:50:30]  Well, I mean, I think this is my theory, and it's going to sound crazy, but I think in  the future, we're going to be seeing a lot more poverty, right?  And we're going to be seeing legitimately these shantytowns all over the place.  And I think this is like a little window into the future of where you're seeing.  So they want to see what is going to happen when there's poverty, because, you know, there's  no way you can just look and see what happens when there's poverty.  I mean, you know, I believe that. 
[01:51:00]  You've got to pop them in the middle of New York City in some tents to really get the feel  of what people will do when they don't have enough food and money and resources.  It is a very odd thing.  And then the other aspect of it is that when you have these protests, they're like very  neutered.  I mean, you have a bunch of people confined to a square, and they're not allowed to, I  mean, they can march.  They have to have a permit to march.  But they're not really allowed to legitimately riot or else, you know, there'd be problems. 
[01:51:30]  I mean, it's not like it was overseas.  But what happens when you have these neutered protests, then it keeps legitimate protests,  I think, from happening.  So it's causing less problems for the elite.  We got Patrick on the line.  Patrick, go ahead.  Yeah, Matt, when you said Soros is a media mogul, where do you get that information?  The guy's a hedge fund manager. 
[01:52:00]  He also...  He's a billionaire, but he's not a media mogul.  He owns a lot of media.  What does he own?  Well, Adbusters is a magazine that actually, you can look it up, actually started this movement  way back in the beginning.  He owns that.  So that makes him a media mogul?  He owns a lot of media.  He owns a lot on the Democratic side.  What does he own?  Well, I think he owns...  I think... 
[01:52:30]  I'm not sure.  I think he owns Comedy Central.  And I...  He owns Comedy Central?  Yes, I think he does.  Viacom?  Viacom owns Comedy Central.  That's Sumner Redstone.  Sumner Redstone.  Okay.  Because they know.  But you know what, though?  What he's saying, what Matt's saying does sound dumb, but...  But when you look at it as a social experiment, I don't think it's a grand conspiracy, but  I wonder if they're watching what happens when there's a breakdown.  Like, okay, what happens when people are in this situation? 
[01:53:00]  And what happens when they have to dole out food?  Not like we're going to control it and starve them out, but what do they do?  How do they handle it?  It might just be interesting to watch, because you really...  When do you get a chance to see it?  To see where this will go?  When do you get a chance to see it when society hasn't broken down?  Right.  You very rarely do, and here it is happening.  But that's not happening.  I would be down there.  Maybe it will.  That's not happening.  Matt is tricking you.  No, but I mean...  There's still a lot of food being doled out.  No, but in general...  The whole thing.  In general, all the tents, people having to live together off each other without quote-unquote 
[01:53:30]  law, just seeing what happens and how it falls apart, because they know it's going to  fall apart.  So who's the one that's in charge of just saying, like, all right, look, let's keep  this thing going.  We got some kind of a little microcosm we can study.  Some guy deep beneath the Earth's crust?  Maybe.  No, but maybe when people talk, they don't say it.  They don't say it.  But if they talk, they may go, well, we're thinking the winter is going to help this fall.  Somebody tells me they want...  But does somebody...  Because obviously... 
[01:54:00]  All right, it is in Bloomberg that's running this little social experiment.  I think he has a lot to do with it.  Well, how do you mean?  Because, I mean, he oversees the whole city.  And not only that, he's a fucking billionaire.  So you think he's looking...  He's with the elite.  So, I mean, there's a reason why the city hasn't put their foot down and stopped this.  And Bloomberg has a lot to do with it.  I don't think he's the very top.  I think this comes from...  So somebody else goes to the mayor of New York City and tells him, here's what I want  you to do?  Yeah.  I think eventually when it has to be stopped. 
[01:54:30]  It's crazy.  No, I think it started already.  I don't think that they...  You don't go to the mayor and have that discussion and have him listen to you.  I think it started.  And as it starts popping up everywhere, getting bigger than people thought it was going to  get, then I think that maybe there's a curiosity that sits in, like, what happens to this?  We know it will fall apart.  Let's see what happens, how it falls apart.  So when it really happens, we understand what to look out for.  It's almost like if you throw five people in a room together or they wind up in a room  together, you don't make it happen.  Let's just see what happens with these five people. 
[01:55:00]  So when it really goes down, we kind of know what the process is.  I think you're absolutely right about that.  Oh, God.  But I don't believe they set it up.  I don't believe that.  It was a 45-year-old experiment called the Soviet Union.  Yeah, exactly.  That's just too much thinking.  I think what happened was that this movement started and they thought, oh, wow, this will  never take off.  So they allowed it to happen.  And now it got to the point like, oh, fuck, now we're stuck because it did take off.  Well, Opie, that's all it is in my stupid fucking brain. 
[01:55:30]  You've seen how structured it is down there, right?  Do you think that that happened organically, that they just kind of a bunch of stupid kids  like, you know, got together and figured this out?  Or maybe they already had a structure in place.  I don't know, Matt, to be honest with you on that.  I'm suspicious.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm absolutely suspicious.  I don't have all the answers.  What kind of structure are you looking at?  Well, just the way they have the working groups where they have the food, the medical.  People will always do that, though.  Any group of people that get together to do something, they'll always, you know, get  the strengths of one. 
[01:56:00]  And all right, a necessity.  You'll be like, oh, I got to get, you know, I got to fucking build a little hooch here.  We need somebody that's going to dole out the food.  You don't just all sit around and circle, jerk.  Just think Thanksgiving dinner.  You all get together and miraculously, everyone just kind of has their job.  There's some secret structure that's underneath the matrix.  Someone doesn't show up with a list and go, okay, you do this.  It just kind of all just kind of comes together, right?  I think it was very organically made. 
[01:56:30]  Maybe, but I mean, I don't think so.  But the other thing is look at the money.  Something doesn't make sense, Matt.  I'll agree with you on that.  Follow the money.  Look at, yes.  What?  I mean, they have, last time I heard, they had maybe $350,000, $400,000 in bank accounts.  Exactly.  It's a week's salary from it.  Who told you that?  Where's this bank account?  You can see it all online.  You can see what online?  It's called the Global Alliance.  Who's going to show their bank statement?  Yeah, who said how much they have?  Right.  People just make shit up and put it online and people buy it. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, who's going to show their bank statement?  Whoever is in charge of that account, why would they ever show that bank statement?  Right, right.  Who would show it?  Exactly.  Look up, like, Occupy Wall Street funding.  I'm not saying it's going to be written somewhere, but it doesn't mean it's true.  Who's going to show you that?  Bill Burberry?  He's the media elite guy.  Why would you ever brag that you've got $400,000 in a bank?  The government would have a problem with that.  Yeah, probably.  Why don't they?  So why would you ever have that info out there? 
[01:57:30]  They're not a non-profit group.  There's articles that have been in the Post and the Daily News about how much money they have.  You can't believe the media, though.  You're going to believe the New York Post?  Who else is?  That's the first thing you should stop believing is everything you read.  We're speculating they may have this.  They definitely have hundreds of thousands of dollars.  How do you know?  There's thousands of dollars coming in every day.  I wouldn't be surprised if they have that money.  But I'm saying I don't think anyone went out of their way to tell the media that's how much money they got and brag about it. 
[01:58:00]  They would never do that.  That would just cause more problems.  When I went down there last month and I was interviewing people, there's a couple people in there that control all the money.  And they have two bank accounts that they deposited into.  And then there's obviously people there making money off of this.  And then people have called in here and said you can – and like Stuntbrain said you went on Craigslist and saw that there are people getting paid.  There's all kinds of reports that people are getting paid to do this. 
[01:58:30]  There's all kinds of signs that are saying that this is not organic, that this is a planned thing.  Why – I mean –  I think some people might be taking advantage of the fact that it did happen organically.  Yeah.  And they're trying to get their agenda across using it.  But I don't think from the floor up this was built out of some kind of grand scheme.  I don't see that.  It's – no fucking way.  It's hard to know for sure, but it's just – there's a lot of signs that say it's – 
[01:59:00]  There are a lot of signs that say stupid things.  That's what I'd say.  Stupid signs down there.  I don't know.  Did you see the sign that said shit –  No!  This is shit is fucked up and not cool or something?  I made that sign.  That's a good one.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was good.  I like that one.  That's great.  Obama actually liked it.  He wanted to use it during his thing, but I wouldn't let him.  Why?  Good.  Because it's my sign.  Well, you guys were better off without interns. 
[01:59:30]  Holy shit.  What are they?  I hear you.  Mostly homeless.  Someone just –  Thanks, man.  When did they put up the toilets?  Oh, okay.  I'm going to read – I believe this is Stunt Brain.  He's so fucking frustrated by Matt being on the air.  Oh.  Why?  Building –  Stunt Brain wants to fuck Matt.  Stunt Brain has a weird sexual thing for Matt.  He wants Matt's deep voice to say stop while he's putting his wiener in.  Stop.  No.  Please don't.  I don't even know.  Stunt Brain, he has our number.  Fucking call us up.  Give us a jingle.  He just gave me ten text messages. 
[02:00:00]  You ready for this?  The sex man's calling.  Builder is tied to Bloomberg and Obama.  What builder?  The tent builder?  He writes, more tents coming too.  Gay tent, married tent, transgender tent.  Yeah, that was just – that was an article today.  Come on.  Really?  Yeah.  Where's the tranny tent?  Jimmy just coming out of the tranny tent all the time.  Yeah, I'm just helping.  I'm delivering food.  Goaling out 20s.  He goes, let me know if you need details.  Of course.  Call the show.  New York City law prohibits gas power generators without permits.  POPs. 
[02:00:30]  Publicity-owned private spaces created in the 70s.  Park owner was deputy mayor of New York City.  I hope someone shanks intern Mattis and Cotty.  Sorry, Matt, for the last one.  We don't wish that on you.  A little shanking.  No.  By shank being fucked up the ass, I said this.  I hope that happens.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  Yeah, why not?  For the goof.  You're laughing at it later.  For the show.  For the show.  The other thing that was well-documented was...  None of this is well-documented.  I want to go to the tranny tent, Matt.  Nothing is well-documented. 
[02:01:00]  Right, that means the first thing was well-documented.  That's all I want to do.  Okay, well, it's something that you can find somewhere.  Hi, Daddy.  With the tent.  Close the flap.  None of us shaved our legs, though, Daddy.  Sorry.  Boo.  Man legs.  What was the other thing well-documented was?  Before this started, J.P. Morgan donated $4.6 million to...  She used to do the gong show.  She was hilarious.  Did Chuck Beres fucking type him?  Yeah.  Remember that?  Jamie Farr?  Yeah.  J.P. Morgan donated $4.6 million. 
[02:01:30]  She was funny.  She was great.  Yeah, meanwhile, Charles Nelson Reilly is fucking withering away in the one tent.  Fucking gay tent.  Fucking ass got his blood on us.  How did J.P. Morgan get so much money?  Saved all that gong show money?  I guess she did.  Matt, try again.  She was shoving it into her vagina like when we did the fucking money snatch.  Giant gaping hole.  Jamie Farr used to fucking get her gaping.  He put money on his nose and shove it in her cunt.  Are we allowed to do the money snatch?  That'd be perfect for these occupied bruds. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know if we're allowed to.  That's too bad.  No insertion.  You can't put it in.  Oh, boy.  That's too bad.  You can put money in your puss.  We could do.  Money, honey.  Not as good as the fucking money snatch was great.  Oh, sorry.  So what happened now?  J.P. Morgan.  Yeah.  She was great.  Yeah.  She was great on the gong show.  They donated $4.6 million to the NYPD back in September, which maybe goes to show you  that they knew that they knew that they were going to have to pay out a lot of overtime and  pay for NYPD to put up their big watchtower thing. 
[02:02:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  How does a company donate to the NYPD?  Exactly.  How'd that happen?  How?  Yes.  How do you know they did?  How do they do that?  You can't just say they did.  Show me this.  I thought that was a budgetary thing.  I didn't think that was open to donations from corporations.  There you go.  You can buy the cups.  What does it say?  Let me see.  Millions to NYPD prior to mass arrests at Occupy Wall Street.  Now, who wrote this? 
[02:03:00]  All right.  It's on the Natural News.  Naturalnews.com.  But they have exactly...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Go down a little bit.  No, no.  I mean up.  I've got to read the first part.  No, this is ads.  Okay.  Okay.  There we go.  It starts there.  All right.  Now, there may be a simple coincidence.  There may be a perfect embodiment of exactly what thousands of protesters across the nation.  But earlier this year, financial giant JPMorgan Chase & Company donated $4.6 million to  the New York Police Department to strengthen security in the Big Apple.  And several months later, the NYPD conveniently arrested over 700 individuals. 
[02:03:30]  Already...  It's conspiracy stuff.  Well, how do you do that?  As a company, how do you do that?  You can donate to anybody.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, Stump Brain's department is losing cash.  And it goes to pay the officers?  Yeah.  It goes to cover the costs that they knew they were going to have to...  I don't believe this.  I don't either.  I don't believe this.  I don't believe it either.  I don't believe this.  Sorry.  I think this is a lie.  I think this website and the guy that fucking wrote this story... 
[02:04:00]  What's his name?  I think he's lying.  Or mistaken.  Or mistaken.  Or mistaken.  I guarantee you this is not the only article about that.  I guarantee you, too.  Look at it.  There's a whole...  I guarantee you, too.  It's all cut and paste.  You can also get it on disinfo.com and addictinginfo.org.  None of that is...  None of that is...  If it's all from the same ideological place, all these newspapers...  Yes, that's right.  The Intel...  If it was from the Post and the New York Times, who are kind of, believe it or not, ideologically  a little bit different, I would give it more credence. 
[02:04:30]  But it's all from the same...  What does it say?  Why would you believe...  One of them, it's in quotation marks, donate.  Why don't you just believe the Post...  Click on that one.  Hold on.  You just believe the Post a minute ago with how much money they had in the bank.  And the Post is the worst paper to believe.  I don't know if that's even in the Post.  But why would you...  Just because something's in mainstream media compared to something that you haven't heard  of, what is the difference?  These are all blogs.  I wouldn't necessarily...  Maybe this is something that they wouldn't want to be reported in the Post.  They don't care if they want it reported in the Post.  The Post would report it.  They report on Rupert Murdoch and the problems that these guys are having. 
[02:05:00]  One guy doesn't control all of the media.  There's too much of it.  A small number of people do.  Listen, we're giving Matt way too much time.  Stump Brain actually knows shit.  Yeah, really?  Hi, Mike.  He's been waiting for like 10 minutes.  Stump Brain, please, help me out here.  Good morning, fellas.  Listen, first of all, Matt, you're wrong about the Chase story.  If you've actually gone to the Chase website and looked it up, this happened in 2010, not  on the eve of the occupation.  J.P.  Morgan Chase donated technology, time, and resources valued at $4.6 million, not CAC. 
[02:05:30]  They donated to the NYPD.  In 2010, J.P.  Morgan Chase donated technology, time, and resources valued at $4.6 million to New York City  Police Foundation, including 1,000 new patrol car laptops.  They can say whatever they want.  It's 2010, though.  They donated $4.6 million.  That's about a year before this whole thing, you know, started.  Well, maybe they knew a year in advance at this point.  But no, you can't, you just, I believe what Stump Brain is saying on the phone, it makes 
[02:06:00]  more sense.  And if they had the story wrong and they're twisting the story, you've got to just admit,  okay, they got the story wrong.  Or maybe J.P.  Morgan Chase on their official website is twisting the story.  Ah, because no one will call that.  Fair enough, but Stump Brain studies this shit.  This is the one thing he's doing lately.  So let's listen.  Exactly.  Let's hear what he has to say.  Well, you study getting coffee, and he studies this stuff.  Don't say so, because his shit is just as important as yours. 
[02:06:30]  More so.  More important.  I would say more, but I'm just trying to be nice.  Go ahead, Stunty.  Stunty.  Well, first of all, if you do the research, more than three weeks ago, we reported the  ties between John Zuccotti, the guy for whom the park is named, the Bloomberg administration  and the Obama administration.  The stories on the blaze, the ties are there.  Zuccotti was a deputy mayor back in the 70s when the city created public-owned private spaces,  which is what this park is.  It happens to be the largest in lower Manhattan, and he happens to be a guy who funded Biden's 
[02:07:00]  son's lobbying firm when it started.  So you have a tie to the White House.  Bloomberg's girlfriend, Diana Taylor, also sits on the board of the company that Zuccotti  co-chairs.  So you've got ties directly back to Zuccotti and the Bloomberg administration and the Obama  White House.  Quite a coincidence, huh?  Yeah.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Right.  George Soros, before you call him a media mogul, Ant was right. 
[02:07:30]  He is a giant hedge fund operator who's made billions of crashing currencies in other countries.  He does own or contribute significantly to Media Matters, which is an organization-  So left-wing.  Oh, yeah.  He's targeting everything on the right with the goal of creating Soros' one-world government.  It's called Open Society.  You can look it up.  He wants all borders erased, all currencies erased, and he wants a one-world global government. 
[02:08:00]  And he doesn't want anyone to have guns.  He's a cunt, George Soros.  Hate that guy.  I mean, you're completely right about that.  Yes, and before you go spout...  You could take that with you today, Stump Brain.  You're completely right about that, according to Matt.  Thank you.  I can sleep well today.  Matt, you might want to read a little bit before you just go off saying all this crap.  And Opie's right.  The food lines are still delivering food.  But not like they were in the beginning.  I haven't seen a drop-off, really. 
[02:08:30]  They're trying to get rid of the professional homeless, these entitled little bits.  They've decided that, oh, we want the food, but we don't want to share it with people,  much like we're demanding the money be shared that we never earned.  Yeah.  Okay.  They took away the good food, and they're trying to drive off the homeless.  The homeless will wait them out.  They're used to cold.  They're used to being hungry.  Now, Stump Brain, have you heard how much money they have in their bank accounts?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:09:00]  Half a million dollars.  Right, right.  John, several websites are showing now you can make tax-free donations to it.  They have well over half a million.  They now have toilets funded by the teachers' union.  The teachers' union is also giving them storage space to keep their hard goods.  So why isn't the IRS coming in and saying, hey, if this isn't a 501c3, a charitable organization,  we want to see the books.  And if you are a charitable organization, we have to see those books.  It is a 501c3.  No, it's not.  It is.  It is. 
[02:09:30]  I talk to people, the people that run the money down there.  It is.  I talk to people in the street.  You can't find a record of it in the government files.  Look on theblaze.com.  We're following it.  I've also seen in some article, they actually said that it was a 501c3.  But I heard directly from people down there who are in the little banking working group,  it is a 501c3.  It's not a, you cannot become a 501c3 that quickly.  You think it's a 501c3?  Which maybe shows you that this is planned months in advance. 
[02:10:00]  I said, you think it is?  No, it's not.  I would say, no, it's not.  I don't know if it's a 501c3.  I know I asked that before, and they said, no, it's still a 501c2.  And it had to work its way up.  Well, boo.  So we'll agree it's a C2?  Stop brain.  What are we missing on this whole fucking thing?  I mean, you've been listening this morning.  I don't understand why it's allowed to continue in all these cities.  What isn't being reported? 
[02:10:30]  Every city has different issues with how they can move people in and out of parks.  You saw curfew being enforced in Atlanta.  And when the people didn't move, the cops moved in and moved 20 people out to the city jail for the night.  And in New York, there is no curfew on this park.  So Zuccotti has to be the guy who says, move them out.  And then and only then will you see action.  And I think he, and as you correctly noted from, I think, a call from a police officer last week, the chief wants to be mayor. 
[02:11:00]  So he doesn't want to run in and clear out the park and have that on everyone's mind.  Okay.  Why did Bloomberg blow it then?  Remember when they wanted to clean the park and they were going to take everyone out of there, clean it up, and then allow them to come back?  But when they were supposed to come back, there were going to be new rules in place, including no tents.  So why did that shut up, Matt?  Why did that go by the wayside?  Because I was down there and there's got to be at least 100 tents down.  And, of course, the big one now, so the women could sleep. 
[02:11:30]  The cock-block tent.  You know where all the women are, so you could just go in there and rape them.  Right.  Just go in there and cut gazzers.  It's protected by women, too.  And they're also building a gay sleeping tent, a transgendered sleeping tent, and a married sleeping tent.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  It's coming.  Trust me.  They're going to do that.  That whole southern wall is going to be – all this stuff is going to be moved out, and the southern wall is going to be the group tents, including the medical tents.  Well, let me ask you.  What is the law about putting these tents up in the park, or is it different because it's privately owned? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, the mayor had a whole list of rules.  One of them was no tents, but they're allowing the tents now.  So did he blow it by saying that?  Privately owned public spaces are allowed to be owned.  But he has to know that going into it.  And that's what this is, a privately owned public space.  Initially, Dupati was no tent.  That's so fucking weird, man.  He backed off of it.  Okay.  So we have to watch.  There's a speculation that Bloomberg may make a third-party run.  He's still retaining huge amounts of political advisors and pollsters, and he doesn't want to be the guy who bulldozed Dupati Park if he's going to make a third-party run. 
[02:12:30]  Does this fucking – does that little jerk-off want to run for mayor again under president?  No, he wants to run for president.  Oh, okay, okay.  Hey, Stunt Brain, are you in agreement?  Because I know you've been down there a lot, too.  There's no way to move these people out at this point without a major situation.  I think they're praying for really bad weather.  Yeah.  And that's going to be the thing that will make it easy.  But unless they get horrible weather, like four or five days of driving rain and brutal cold, those people are pretty well dug in right now. 
[02:13:00]  And with that huge tent, you couldn't take that thing down with the storms we had last winter.  Yeah, it's a big structure.  They're not like tents like we think of a tent.  It's like a tent from MASH, you know, where it's a wooden substructure and canvas over it and shit.  What about just going down there and just going, all right, let's go.  Everybody, all right, let's go.  Time to go.  Nothing to see here.  Party's over.  Nothing to see here.  Come on now.  Get McCluskey down there.  McCluskey.  I clean all you dirty hoods out. 
[02:13:30]  Stand them up.  I think, Opie, you said it right.  It's going to take severe, you know, protest or protest or violence or murder.  We saw the death in Vancouver.  Murder.  That mayor has said we're closing this place up.  We've got a dead body here.  And if that happens here, you'll see it shut down instantly.  But it would probably move somewhere else.  Do you think that Quincy could just go in there and just kind of quiet them down like he did at the punk rock club and talk to everybody?  Let me talk to you. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, there's some bad codeine in the transgender tent.  I got some on my mouth blowing someone through a hole in the tent.  Yeah, the tent looks like Swiss cheese.  I didn't know there's a bunch of wigs in it.  Transgender.  That stupid crowd shut up quickly, huh?  Oh, shit.  When Quince talked.  Can I ask some better questions?  Sure.  So, I mean, you're very well informed on this.  Yes, of course I am.  Yeah, I know.  Why do you think that this is allowed to go on? 
[02:14:30]  I mean, obviously you see the connections between the owner of the park.  Yeah.  Were you just not listening?  Yes, I was absolutely listening.  So you think it's for political reasons?  I think it's myriad reasons.  But you have, you know, dissatisfied youth like yourself who are empowered and supported by parents who don't want them to have to go out and deal with the realities of life and get a job.  And suddenly they've organized through social media.  You have opportunistic political factions who think they can make these people into useful idiots. 
[02:15:00]  You ought to read Animal Farm by Orwell.  I did.  It just might educate you as to what's going on.  That comes up a lot, by the way.  The Animal Farm.  I'm the piggy.  Yay.  Very good.  Where'd you go?  I don't think we know the whole reason yet.  And that's why one of the reasons I'm going down there almost weekly now to try and find out.  And I'm sure that's why Opie's going down, too, because we want to understand it.  Now, can you see?  Yeah, I do want to understand it a little bit, but it's just fascinating to me. 
[02:15:30]  It's a freak show.  It's like, as far as people watching, it's the best place to do it in New York right now.  Fantastic.  And the food is good.  It used to be.  I was scared of.  I've been scared of the food since the first day it went down.  It's great.  I do want some of that free ice cream.  It's forks and knives, and it's wonderful.  You get a tray with four magnets.  Stummer, can you see the possibility, though, that at least one aspect of this is a social experiment?  No.  You really don't. 
[02:16:00]  Even though you can see all the ties to money coming in from the elite, you can't see that  this might be a social experiment.  We do that with Jersey Shore in real world.  We don't need to fucking do it in a dirty park in New York City.  Well, this is like a real life thing.  A real life social experiment.  I wouldn't hang out with any of those fucking people that I've seen down there.  How is that real life?  How is it not real life?  They're dregs.  How is it?  They're homeless.  They're fucking old hippies.  They're drug addicts.  There's criminals down there.  That's what I see in the actual park. 
[02:16:30]  The whole criminal thing is overplayed.  I mean...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Tell that to the two women who were raped.  She wasn't...  First of all, she wasn't raped.  The guy went in her tent and tried to take her pants off.  That's not fucking rape.  Yeah.  I just yelled nice tits and grabbed them and rolled around yelling, let's kill the man.  How is trying to take her pants off and she says no and then he gets all freaked out  and leaves the tent.  How is that rape?  So that's not a crime?  No.  Matt doesn't think that's a crime.  You're ridiculous.  No, he's right.  You're talking to a guy who went down there and was proud of fingering a stranger. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I'm 100% with him on that.  He should have been.  To finger a stranger is an accomplishment.  You ever try to finger a stranger?  It's not easy.  That's great.  Fucking home run from Matt on that one.  Yeah, we can't argue that one.  Yeah, if you finger a stranger, you win.  Crime thing is just completely overplayed.  Blown out of proportion.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Got a bunch of dirty, filthy fucking assholes down there living on top of each other.  It's overplayed to the point they're building basically a building down there.  An anti-rape tent.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:17:30]  So I guess it is overplayed.  They feel like they need it.  Yeah, the people decide themselves.  One fucking roping situation.  People themselves decided that it's a problem, that we have to build this fucking secure  tent.  I mean, you got hippies living in a confined space in tent.  It's fucking cold outside.  Obviously, there's going to be some shenanigans going on at night.  Shenanigans and rape should not be compared.  He's calling it shenanigans now.  Jesus.  That's you, Matt.  Yeah.  What happened?  That was an Australian. 
[02:18:00]  It's Matt, like, all drunk, fucking drinking a shot of Jaeger or something.  Yeah, it is.  I think it's Jaeger, yeah.  And it's like, every time he talks, I just look at that picture when you talk.  Right.  And it makes perfect sense now.  You're hammered.  Is that you in that dump suit?  Yeah.  Where are you at fucking New Orleans?  Australia.  What's that stupid green thing around your neck?  Probably beets.  Why did you go to Australia?  It was a study abroad.  Jesus Christ.  So you're wealthy.  Yeah, he's kind of wealthy.  Not wealthy.  Play one of the fucking 99%. 
[02:18:30]  Poor kids never study abroad.  No, they don't.  Never.  Abroad?  What are you kidding me?  Never.  Poor kids never study abroad.  I wish someone tried to make you mule heroin.  I went to college in Geneseo and I made a trip to Niagara Falls.  There you go.  You're studying abroad.  There was my studying abroad.  You didn't study abroad?  It was a trip to Niagara Falls.  That was Egypt.  So you went to Egypt also.  See, you're just a fucking entitled cunt.  Wait, you went to Egypt and you went to Australia?  Yeah.  What are you talking about? 
[02:19:00]  I'm trying to be with you here, but what are you talking about the elite for when you're  traveling the world?  You don't even know how it is to work hard and struggle.  I'm fucking on loans.  I'm not traveling the world because I'm a millionaire.  I mean, I hopefully...  Why would I spend money on loans to go to fucking Egypt when you could be on a community college?  I like to experience life.  I like to go and travel.  Some people don't have the money to do that.  I would love to experience life.  But guess what?  We got jobs.  How are you getting loans?  I know these are easy jobs, but...  Because I'm white and I have good credit and my parents have good credit. 
[02:19:30]  How old are you?  Exactly.  Parents.  25 now.  So it's your parents.  Just say it's your parents.  Your parents.  They're not going to loan you enough money to go to Australia and Egypt with no job.  That doesn't make sense.  I mean, you know, it's not that expensive once you're there.  You know, you go and you stay in hostels and shit and it's...  You stayed in hostels?  Yeah.  I went to Israel, Jordan, Egypt, France.  I went all over Europe.  You can't travel cheap, I guess.  Yeah.  But I just don't believe that they would give him the loans to do it with no show of income  without his parents.  They do.  They give out...  Like, I still get letters in the mail. 
[02:20:00]  No, these are all...  This is actually when I went overseas, it was all credit cards.  How much do you own now?  How much do I owe?  Yeah.  Probably 10, 12 grand.  But it's weird.  Because I know you were complaining about how they want people in debt when they get out  of school.  But you're voluntarily putting yourself in debt.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, why not?  You voluntarily put yourself in debt.  Yeah, I am.  I am.  But if you're going to partake in this system, like, unnecessarily, you can't, like, smash  it.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  Like, if you're volunteering to travel the world and take the money... 
[02:20:30]  The system allowed you to go to Egypt.  You're a hypocrite.  The system allowed you to go to Egypt.  And Australia.  Yeah.  And it's allowing me to be here.  And they advanced you the money.  The system advanced you the money.  Here, go ahead.  Travel.  True.  Stunt brain.  Anything else?  You got to be balanced.  Yeah.  Matt, he's the 1%.  He's not the 99%.  Exactly.  I'm not the 1%.  You're 1%.  The 1% Matt.  You're 1% Matt.  Where else have you been?  He's the 1% that dresses like fucking Bernie Ennert.  Bernie and Bert.  Bernie and Ert. 
[02:21:00]  Oh!  Wow.  Tag that.  Tag that one.  You're tuckered out.  Bernie and Ert.  Wow, Jimmy.  Nimmie Jordan is fucking mad up.  Yeah.  I never would have got that wrong.  Now, Matt, what does your dad do for a living?  I don't want to say.  He's an optical engineer.  He doesn't make that much.  He makes like, I don't know, 60 grand, I think.  Probably a day.  Really?  Yeah.  And my mom makes like 50 grand. 
[02:21:30]  She sells ads.  She does like web camera stuff?  Yes.  Exactly.  Something doesn't add up.  She has a lime green fist.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think they own their own house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In Rochester, I mean.  Oh, that's nice.  It's a $100,000 house.  Down here, it would probably be $600,000, $700,000.  Whatever.  Homeowners money.  Your dad only makes $60,000 a year?  Yeah.  Well, the mom makes $50,000.  I don't believe that.  That's $110,000. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Rochester, that's good living.  You want to call him up?  No.  Love to.  I'll take your word, I guess.  Whatever.  It's exhausting.  Stump Ryan, anything else?  That's it, boys.  Thanks.  Always a pleasure.  Matt, try reading.  Thanks, Mike.  Thanks, man.  See you, man.  All right.  Later, M.O.  Yeah.  Thanks to Matt.  He's a good egg.  Glad we still keep in touch with that guy.  Yeah.  He was fun.  He's got knowledge.  Yeah.  He's got some.  He's getting his knowledge on.  My knowledge is. 
[02:22:30]  I went to Yankee Stadium with him.  The old one is just to be there.  Before Closed to Watch.  I finally get to see Jeter play.  Oh, yeah.  He was fun.  He's a fun guy to hang out with.  Yeah.  He's all right.  Yeah.  You're right.  I'll downgrade to all right.  I say he's a fun guy to hang out with you and he's all right.  He's all right.  I'll accept that.  I said it in a nice way.  He's all right.  I know, but I'll accept that.  Plug his website.  It's theblaze.com.  That's right.  Major contributor over there.  Because he's flaming.  It's appropriate.  Who is that girl that you're blowing fucking bongs with? 
[02:23:00]  I met her on the beach.  She's cute.  Yeah.  This was actually.  This wasn't easy.  This was Tel Aviv, Israel.  Oh, she's cute.  And it was my first day there and I met her on the beach and we got drunk.  Fuck her?  She blew me a lot and then it took me a while, but I did eventually fuck her.  How was the blow job?  It was.  I think they were pretty good.  Not, you know, exceptional, but.  Okay.  Did you eat a pussy?  A bad one's even good.  I think so.  A couple times. 
[02:23:30]  Did you eat her ass?  No.  I've never eaten anybody's ass.  Well, then that's what you should be fucking protesting.  What are you wearing?  You should be protesting against you.  Exactly.  You should be booing yourself in the mirror.  How have you never eaten an ass?  It's just.  I don't know.  What are you doing?  You see the flag.  Turn away.  You're wasting your youth.  It's a girl, though.  Yeah.  You're wasting that.  You're wasting your youth.  You don't delve into old girl ass.  I mean.  You don't decide to do that in your 40s.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  The vagina smells nice, you know, and it tastes nice.  So is an ass. 
[02:24:00]  A nice, clean girl with a nice ass.  Yeah, throw her in a shower.  I don't know.  Get in there, man.  Yeah, fucking eat an ass.  It's not like there's shit waiting at the fucking doorway to pop out in your mouth.  Exactly.  I will.  You discover that, you don't have to go to Egypt anymore, in Australia.  You don't have to stay right here in the good old U.S. of A.  U.S. of A.  The ass-eating capital of the world.  That's right.  You don't want to lick it and feel a log poking you like you're French kissing the asshole.  You've got to be careful.  I really don't.  You've never eaten an ass?  No.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Look at that pretty blonde. 
[02:24:30]  You're a communist.  First thing I would have done is eaten her ass right by the whaling wall.  Yeah, you should have been right there.  Peg her against the whaling wall, right?  Yeah.  Stick your fucking tongue in.  I mean, I focus on, I love tits.  But they do eat a lot of hummus in that part of the world, so that could be a problem.  She was Australian.  Oh, cool.  I like Australian chips.  But in Tel Aviv?  Yes.  What was she doing there?  Is that allowed?  Can you be Australian in Tel Aviv?  Yeah, I think they allow that.  All right.  I thought you were going to say, can you eat ass in Tel Aviv?  What was she doing there?  She was just backpacking.  Did you only see her that day and that was it? 
[02:25:00]  No, no.  We hung out for like a week.  And you never saw her again?  No.  No keeping in touch?  No.  I wanted a backpack when I was growing up.  You said goodbye?  Why didn't you?  Yeah, I think I said goodbye.  Goodbye.  I had to fucking help pay the bills for my family.  Ow.  You don't miss her?  No.  You don't think about her?  No.  99%?  It's weird.  How long ago was that?  This was last summer.  Jesus, you've had a rough year.  Did you come in her mouth?  Yeah.  That's cool.  On her face?  Good A.  I don't think on her face.  How hairy was her pussy?  It was shaved. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, fucking nice, man.  Totally?  Yeah.  She had big lips?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She had big pussy lips?  Yeah.  Are you going to keep in touch?  No.  Jimmy's stunned.  I don't get this, kid.  You don't eat ass.  How big were they, for real?  Like, were they fat or thick or long or what?  Yeah, it was kind of a long pussy and I think she had kind of big lips.  Oh, fuck, man.  This girl I've been fooling around lately is really, like, meaty.  Oh, I like that.  Can I see a picture?  Can I get a picture? 
[02:26:00]  I got a picture.  That's hot.  Is she pretty?  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  What nationality?  Probably Native American, right?  I think I have big pussies.  Matt has no idea what's going on.  What?  Jimmy's extremely turned on and you're helping it along.  I'm more interested than turned on.  I'm more interested.  I'm too tired to be turned on.  But I am interested.  She's got a meaty pussy?  Yeah.  She shave it?  Yeah.  Do you tell her it's a meaty pussy?  Tell her it's fleshy?  I haven't told her that.  He's basically having phone sex with Jimmy.  He doesn't even know it.  Matt doesn't even know it.  Like, after I fuck her for a while or eat her pussy for a while, like, I think it's... 
[02:26:30]  Jimmy's even leaning back on it.  The thing that comes out...  Uh-oh.  Is that the labia?  The thing that comes out?  The clit?  Is that the clit?  The thing that comes out of the pussy.  Oh, my God.  The big thing that you suck on.  Yeah, that's the clit.  That's the clit.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that just told me he has no idea what the clit is.  Can I tell you, by the way, if this girl was listening...  I want to see if he could point out where the clit is.  You're wasting your pussy on Matt.  I'll take very good care of it.  Does it smell?  Oh, my God. 
[02:27:00]  Not really.  A little bit, right?  Sometimes, but usually it's pretty...  I don't mind that.  Sometimes.  When she gets really...  Maybe it was an older lady and it was her uterus.  Well, it says in there.  When she gets really fucking wet, it'll sink a little...  She gets extremely wet.  Could you bring her into a commuter?  I'll be nice to her.  I wouldn't be rude.  It's not a great idea.  Why?  Where's the clit?  It's just not a great idea.  How old is she?  Where's the clit?  Find the clit.  Find the clit.  She's pretty?  You've got a cartoon pussy.  Can we see a picture of her?  Okay, see, I wasn't sure.  I thought the clit... 
[02:27:30]  Honestly, I thought the clit was a thing at the top that you lick.  All right, but where is it?  Okay, well...  Point to the clit.  Point to it.  Apparently, is that...  Wrong.  Where's he pointing, Sam?  He's pointing right in the middle.  To the bottom of the vagina.  Right in the middle of the hole.  I don't know the fucking terms.  Where's the wiener go?  The clit's on top.  Where does your wiener go?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  Where does your wiener go?  Where's the thing in the middle that gets really big?  Where does your wiener go?  And you can put it between your teeth.  Isn't that the labia?  That's just between your teeth.  What, a toothpick?  Where's the wiener go?  Yeah, you can kind of put it between your teeth. 
[02:28:00]  That's the labia.  Lightly, like...  Show where the wiener goes.  Show where the wiener goes.  Where's the wiener go?  Now, wrong.  It's below where the shit comes out.  That's where the wiener goes.  Now, show the clit.  Point at the clit.  Yeah, that's right.  Where'd you just point?  To the urethra?  No.  Do you know where the clit is?  The top of the pussy.  You sure?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  That's what I thought.  All right, the one was sticking out of her.  Oh, my God.  The fuck was sticking out of her then?  Unless you're sure, you're not sure.  How old is she?  She's 22.  Oh, this poor fucking girl. 
[02:28:30]  As he's just biting on fucking labia minora like fucking hubba bubba.  Let's see her picture.  Chewing a cunt like hubba bubba.  I know.  He calls her all gum cunt.  Jesus.  Nothing.  No, sorry.  This kid's amazing.  I love him.  I love the fact he's got a meaty pussy that gets sweaty.  This kid, he rules.  But he doesn't know the anatomy of the female fucking vagina.  He wasn't sure where the clit was.  The vagina.  I mean, I don't know the fucking terms.  Terms?  There ain't no terms.  You pointed to the wrong thing. 
[02:29:00]  Okay, so what is it?  You pointed to her home.  Where do you look for her pleasure?  The thing that gets really big when she's really turned on.  Isn't that the lady that pissed the dick?  Yeah, that's probably the dick.  Wow, she fucking gets really hurt.  I cup her balls and I lick up and down her shaft.  I want to see a picture of her vagina.  Do you have one on your phone?  No.  Why?  I don't know.  Is that her?  She's pretty hot.  She's cute, man.  Let's see all the pictures.  Big boobies?  Yes.  Huge.  Huge.  She's got a little bit of fat. 
[02:29:30]  She's fucking hot, man.  But the boobies are all, they're not fat boobies.  Well, that's fucking, she's juicy, man.  Oh.  Matt, just don't say anything.  Jimmy's trying to engage in some more phone sex.  Don't do it.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, wow.  Let me say.  Don't do it.  Click off of that.  What?  Find a good picture.  Not the same one that's up there.  God damn you.  Okay.  I want to see the vag.  All right, let's see.  All right.  I don't think she has any vag fix there.  She's hot. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, she's very cute, man.  Very sexy girl.  God, now I know that about her.  I fucking love it.  Can you snap a picture with your phone?  I don't need to see her face in it.  Just show me the vag.  And tell her it's from my pal Jim.  Just show me the vag.  I will.  Are those tits fake?  No.  What are they, like fucking 40 double D?  They're fucked.  They're massive.  They're absolutely massive.  Oh, yeah.  What color?  You're having phone sex again, Matt.  No, I'm asking him.  I have a pretty standard nipple color. 
[02:30:30]  They're about this big.  That's the nipple itself or the areola?  The whole thing.  The part around.  That's not that big.  That's the areola.  Okay.  They're not massive.  I like a thick, like, eraser nipple.  I like an areola that looks like a fucking owl's face.  Like a big owl eye areola.  Like her fucking titch just went three rounds and lost.  Are you a fan of the moose nose?  Yeah, I like the moose nose a lot.  And she lays back and waits for fucking satisfaction that doesn't come with his oral fucking sex.  Because he doesn't know where the clit is. 
[02:31:00]  But I do pretty well.  I may not know the terms, but I do pretty well.  Hunting around with a GPS down there.  You fucking don't know.  I don't know.  I would give her vagina its comeuppance.  Yeah, just eating it.  I'm an average fuck, but I eat pussy really well.  You're a tremendous fuck.  I have a really big dick, so I'm a very good friend.  Are you really packing?  Yeah.  How many are you packing?  About seven.  That's a really big dick?  That's not a really big dick.  Where are you from?  Fucking, where are you from, Taiwan?  A legitimate seven. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I get it.  Not fucking.  It's not small, but that's not a really big dick.  That's fine.  Show him a really big.  He doesn't even know what a really big dick looks like.  Exactly.  Walk down the hall.  Show him a really big dick.  I'm going to tell you something, Matt.  He wears glasses and it takes up the corner off.  Seven is fine.  It's a huge shot.  Seven is good, but don't ever say, I got a really big dick and then spit out seven again.  Yeah, we'll show you a big dick.  That's a big dick, okay?  All right.  Yeah, not that big, but almost.  And there's a million of these online.  Yeah.  But also, these are very close-up shots, so it makes it... 
[02:32:00]  Seven is seven, Matt.  Nine is nine.  Jimmy, what would be a really big dick?  Nine and above?  See, the way...  Yeah, no, eight and a half fat and bigger, I would say, is a really big dick.  That, that's about, that's about mine right there.  He's pointing out what...  You're hilarious, man.  Do you, are you, are you, are you, are you just a cry for fucking attention?  Exactly.  Yeah.  I really am.  You really, I really am.  You really are.  And if you're saying seven, that means you're probably six and a quarter.  No, it's a legitimate seven. 
[02:32:30]  You might be telling the truth, but it's like, it doesn't, it's like, even if you are being  honest, you don't say on the radio, I got a really big dick.  What are you packing?  Seven.  Measure from the tailbone.  I'm not going to make it up.  By the way, Dr. Steve...  No, that's what I'm saying, but don't say really big dick and then seven.  Dr. Steve is checking in, and I'm sure he sent the text to all of us.  Let me say, hi-yah.  This phony friend of mine.  Does he have fluid on it?  He writes, hot, it's probably a prolapsed uterus.  The thing that comes out of her vagina when she gets turned on sounds like there may be a 
[02:33:00]  problem.  What?  Oh, shit.  It's funny.  Other men's come.  Yeah, Dr. Steve doesn't play, man.  He's not making jokes.  There's probably a legitimate problem.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Matt.  Matt, Matt, Matt.  That's funny.  By the way, 1% Matt.  Hmm?  Hear about his dick?  Fucking really big.  Yeah, it's really huge.  Really big.  Yeah.  Opie, if you ever want to do that skating contest, Central Park, 10 to 3 every day. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, my God.  More.  I think it's a good idea.  They are me, me, me, me.  Attention, have attention for me, me, me.  And there's absolutely no way you can out-skate me.  What are you bringing this up for?  I skate four, five, six times a week.  You know how many listeners care?  Nobody.  I've skated my ass off my entire life.  All right.  Ops is skating for fucking, what, 35 years?  Jesus.  All right.  Because he was a kid in the 80s.  Yeah.  Child of the 80s.  Do you ever play?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  You good?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Me and you, one-on-one.  Let's do it.  Watch out for that big dick, eh?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know how we could skate so fast with that big dick.  He doesn't even need a stick.  How do you scrap that big dick down so you can skate?  As you know, when you skate, it shrinks.  For two reasons.  One, because the ice is cold.  And two, because you're fucking skating hard.  Yeah, but you got a big one, so it's got to be a problem.  Yeah, exactly.  Even shrunk off is so nice and big.  How do you find a cup that big?  Extra large.  That was nice for me.  Thank you.  You fought in?  I broke wind. 
[02:34:30]  Aw.  What?  You just got a big one.  Let's go to Ann for a second.  Ann's bothered by a bunch of things.  I'm bothered by the phone sex that I was watching going down.  I'm just done.  I was just asking about the girl's pussy.  It's a legit question.  No, it's how you say it, though.  You get a little...  I'm just eager.  Your voice changes.  I've been fucked in a while, dude.  Really?  Yeah, I'm single, man.  I haven't fucked in a while.  Ugh.  It's been awful.  But Ann, what's the problem?  There's something going on with you.  He's so annoying. 
[02:35:00]  He's just annoying.  I don't like Matt, and it's unfair, because I grew up around kids like him, and it used  to drive me fucking nuts.  It's not unfair, though.  He's not a likable person.  It's not like it's...  It's not fair.  Now he's handing his phone to Jimmy.  It's just like this attention thing.  Wait, show me a picture.  Who is it?  That was five years ago.  Who are they?  That's me.  He was just explaining why he doesn't like Matt.  And Matt doesn't even pay attention.  Oh, I know, because that's...  She's cute.  Oh.  It's perfectly fair that you don't like him.  Kids like Kim never had to pay attention.  Outside the...  Oh, she's fucking smoking. 
[02:35:30]  And then to Rebelle, he's a cliche.  What happened?  He is a cliche.  Fucking cliche, man.  Why?  She's fucking smoking.  She couldn't handle that big dick it is anymore.  Exactly.  She had to get a smaller one with a guy who was half Dominican, half black.  Tremendous dick.  Why don't we backpack when we were growing up?  I know I just couldn't.  I wouldn't have been able to go to college.  I was too busy jerking off the porn from Rite Aid.  I had to fucking work the whole summer to make money to go to college.  It wasn't even an option.  What would your parents have said if you graduated college and you were like... 
[02:36:00]  They showed them you're a big dick.  Instead of going to work, I'm just going to backpack for a couple years.  Yeah.  I guess at that point it was up to me, but I mean, it sounds like he was backpacking  during the college years, right?  Mm-hmm.  Carrying that big dick around country to country.  Oh, my God.  In his backpack.  He would actually snake it up through his shirt and over into his backpack.  Got its own passport.  Yeah.  Just big dick on the passport.  I had to make my own tuition and help with the family bills. 
[02:36:30]  I didn't have a choice.  I guess I did, maybe.  I don't know.  If I wanted to be homeless.  I got a big dick, too.  It's like five.  Really?  That's not big.  Stick it right in, girls.  It's pretty big.  Five is not big.  No.  Sam, how big are you?  I wouldn't...  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say it's huge.  You sit here and compare dicks?  I say Sam's about six.  I think we...  Sam's...  I have a feeling Sam's got a big dick.  I think we all have about the same fucking dick in this room.  Yeah.  Let's get him on the table, boys.  I would never say I have a big... 
[02:37:00]  It's, you know...  It's fine.  It's not small.  It's adequate.  If you're craving attention, you yell out things like you have a big dick.  I have an adequate penis.  Oh, you never say that?  No, he's never said it.  He just acts like one.  Sam has never admitted to his big dick status.  I've never said it.  I just heard women go, wow.  That's where this all started many years ago.  I think Ant likes the legend.  I think Ant has a good dick, but I think that some woman wowed...  Probably something else.  Yeah, the legendary status.  It's like Opie's abs.  It's got the dick. 
[02:37:30]  No, no, but see...  It's like McGuire admitting that he fucking took Roy.  But see, I never did a Mike this situation and had girls wowing.  My whole thing is...  It's an old story, but when Ant Desai showed a bunch of girls a dick and they went behind  the van, all I heard was wow by more than one.  Okay?  And that's where this whole fucking thing started.  They touched it.  No one has ever seen Ant's dick.  They touched it, too.  That was fun.  Did they touch it?  Yeah, she goes, ooh.  And she started fiddling with it.  Was she drunk?  Did she clumsily squeeze the head? 
[02:38:00]  Half the head and half the hair?  It was clumsy.  She's got a cunt.  Yeah.  You just thought your Matt wasn't there.  I know.  And then the stupid broad pulled down.  What the fuck did she pull down?  Everything fell.  She had this dress thing on, a skirt with a top, and she pulled it down and her gut came  pouring out.  Everything came pouring out.  It was like she was made of mercury.  And then the blah, blah, just fell out.  She gave you a clumsy weenie pinch.  And then the classic end of the story.  Then they came toward me because Ant showed, and I wasn't ready. 
[02:38:30]  I wasn't.  My presentation wasn't good enough to show.  You're too bashful.  You should have pulled it out just to punish them.  Look at this little thing.  It's like a baby dick.  Not after the wow that Ant got.  I was like, fuck that.  Oh, come on.  There's no way I'm going to get a wow like I just heard.  You got to fucking yank it out.  It was the perfect storm.  Was it?  Yeah.  It was the perfect storm.  That's a big dick, man.  I bet girls say, wow, you have a big dick.  What are they going to say?  You told them first.  They had to reiterate it. 
[02:39:00]  You missed the word R.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow, you're a.  Not you have, you're a.  Bravo, sir.  It's good.  I just tag dance joke.  That's all right.  All right, man.  We didn't learn much from you.  No, we didn't.  We learned something.  We learned seven things.  Yeah.  We learned that you're not positive where the clit is.  He's a hypocritical attention whore that cannot satisfy women.  Exactly.  Something pops out of this chick that might be a problem.  Oh, well.  Well, that's because he's got a nice big one.  That's right. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, he's got a big weenie.  Yeah.  A nice big pecker.  Is that how you got the internship here?  They're like, what are your qualifications?  He goes, I'll give you a fucking seven fat qualifier.  I got a seven inch pecker.  And they went, holy mackerel.  That's big in porn in the 70s.  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  And no one asked him if he had a big dick, did he?  I got a big dick.  No, no.  He just had to tell everyone.  Well, I was saying that I'm an average fuck, but I eat pussy well.  And he fucking jumped in and goes, I'm a good fuck because I got a really big dick.  He goes, actually, I have a really big dick in Eskimo. 
[02:40:00]  So I was thinking maybe he had like fucking nine and a quarter.  That's a really big dick.  But then he goes, seven.  And it's like, that's fine.  But here's what you should say.  My dick's fine.  Yeah.  It's not fine.  It's a lot better than fine.  It's a big one.  It's fucking, it's better than fine because it's on you.  And chicks look at you and the shape of your head and they think that your dick is going  to be atrocious.  Believe me, my dick's fine too.  Compared to other guys, it's awful.  But compared to like the schlubby awfulness of me, it looks impressive. 
[02:40:30]  What does the shape of my head have to do with it?  It's round and creepy.  You're like an ugly guy where you got a big dick.  I'm confused by Jimmy because I, I have seen his dick fully aroused by the way.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Sure.  Okay.  Jimmy's got a big dick, but for some reason he doesn't want to say that, I guess.  Nice.  Because to me, a big dick is fucking nine and a quarter.  And before people get confused.  That's like a big porn dick.  That's a big dick.  Exactly.  Big whatever.  Put the adjective you want.  If you want to be a porn, you have to have a massive fucking dick.  Yes. 
[02:41:00]  You know?  So I think there's a difference.  That's a big dick.  That's like, hey, Matt.  I don't want it just dangling out there.  I got to explain why I saw Jimmy's big aroused dick.  Everybody knows why.  Did you measure it?  Yeah.  No.  Jimmy.  He put it on his wrist.  He goes, fuck.  Oh, my wrist is about eight inches.  Jimmy couldn't wait to show me in the rear view mirror.  He actually moved the rear view mirror so I could see this sick fuck.  I was getting blown.  He was getting blown through.  We were in the middle of Times Square when I saw Jimmy's big aroused dick.  That was fucking with that girl.  I was dropping off at a bus station.  At Port Authority.  At Port Authority. 
[02:41:30]  And Ops in the back seat.  And she's fucking blowing me.  She was on buses for 12 straight hours so Jimmy could have sex with her in the bathroom  during our radio show.  She was sexy, man.  I fucked her over the toilet.  I fucked her over the toilet at N.E.W.  And then this piece of shit that shows over and he's like, well, what time is your bus?  Back on the bus, whore.  So me and Jimmy were going to eat or something.  I don't remember exactly where we were going.  It was like seven o'clock at night.  I'm in the back seat, Jimmy's driving, she's in the passenger seat, and she decides to  have at it one more time before she gets to the Port Authority. 
[02:42:00]  And he tilted the mirror down so you could take a look.  Yeah, of course.  I'm a good friend.  And then, you know what?  Of course, at that point, you've got to take a peek.  And me and Jimmy were laughing our asses off to each other through the mirror.  Jesus.  You like being watched?  Not in particular, but at that moment, I was warning.  It was funny.  Like, I'm more, it was all about comedy.  He doesn't know where the clitoris is.  Yeah, I'm not big on being watched.  Occasionally, I'll enjoy it if it's really inappropriate.  But with my friends, no, because it's too personal because he's my friend.  I get turned on by, like, a couple times. 
[02:42:30]  Who asked?  We didn't ask you.  Who the fuck asked him?  Well, I want to know how fucking him and his big dick are turned on.  A minute ago, he didn't know where the clit was, and now he's just exchanging sexual stories.  Now, all of a sudden, he's a fucking exhibitionist.  Let me tell you what my turn-ons are.  Yeah.  First of all, leave my big dick.  Any tape around?  So what happened, Matt?  What did you get turned on?  Well, like, one time, like, the girl I showed you, she was blowing me, and my friend was,  like, watching, like, creepily, like, oh, that's fun.  And he was videotaping another time. 
[02:43:00]  And then also, like, I love, like, outdoor sex and sex in places.  That's why you like the park so much.  And now you're having phone sex with Jimmy again.  No, he's not.  I'm not big on outdoor.  That's very funny.  Opie put a sign up.  It says, the Opie and Anthony and Matt show.  Yeah.  Well, look, when the big dick walks in the room, he lets everybody know.  Hey, that's right.  Exactly.  Let me give you some info you never fucking asked for or wanted. 
[02:43:30]  I'm big dick Matt.  I'm big dick Matt.  Did anyone ask you about having sex outside?  No.  Oh, okay.  He just started bringing, no, it didn't come up.  You brought it up.  You said, so, what are your sexual turn offs?  Here are my turn offs.  My big dick gets into some crazy situations.  That is a big dick shot of a segment.  My big dick got shot in The Godfather.  It was stretchy.  Stretchy.  Big dick Matt.  I can see the production now, man. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, I know the story from big dick Matt.  Danny and Travis call me Hot Matt 69.  Because that's just, first of all, it doesn't matter.  I don't think they just call you that.  And second of all, there's obviously a joke there.  After we hired him, we looked for him on Facebook.  Yeah.  And his Facebook name, which is, this is the only reason he brought that up, because  he wants this mentioned on the air, obviously.  I didn't even realize it was that.  Just shut up.  It's Hot with two T's, Matt with two T's, a six and a nine. 
[02:44:30]  That makes him, if you look at him on Facebook, Hot Matt 69.  God, it's so hack.  I didn't even realize it was that.  What do you mean you didn't realize it, Dan?  I really did.  I forgot that I did that.  So the transcripts here are from Hot Matt 69.  He remembered.  I want to have sacks.  I enjoy outdoor sacks.  So when Danny and Travis called you that, you just thought they were making it up out of  the blue?  No, I really didn't know where they got that from.  You must have been thinking about that big dick of yours.  Exactly.  All that blood's rushing down to that fucking massive gift. 
[02:45:00]  Did you tell this girl that you had a big dick?  I thought it was because of that one picture.  Chris Hansen printed out.  It's because they're making fun of you.  Yes, I know.  Do you know what that's like?  All right.  When you say you had a big dick, that's like saying, I got a fucking, I'm loaded.  How much you got?  $47.  Yeah.  I would never say that I have a big dick.  I would.  I know I don't have a...  I know about you.  You have a great stomach and a duty stain on your shirt.  Look at where the beat compliments that duty stain. 
[02:45:30]  Looks like you came blood on your own shirt.  He's got duty stains on his shirt.  Wow.  You look like me after a lap dance in a shitty place.  A brown cum stain.  Matt doesn't know what you're talking about because when he comes on himself, it's all  the way up towards his neck.  Yeah.  That big dick is pointing out.  That's true.  That's right.  Matt and his big dick.  I mean, a lot of times when I'm jerking off, I'll literally...  We didn't ask you.  Once again, we didn't ask you any of this.  We gotta let it finish.  You gotta let it finish.  Just rude. 
[02:46:00]  What happened?  A lot of times when I'm jerking off, I'll end up cumming on my own face because it...  Because it's so big and it shoots.  You know what?  I got that in common with that.  Why would you get out of the way of the cum as it's coming back down to earth?  What am I supposed to just fucking dodge it?  Exactly.  It has a taste.  I move into it.  I got to...  I saw it with you there.  There's something empowering about blasting yourself.  It really is.  There was only a girl here to be punished.  Well, it's impressive to know that you can shoot that high in a...  Really?  Is it?  More impressive to know where a fucking clit is. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  It's a little more impressive sexually for your sexual prowess.  You don't need to know...  Not to come on your face, but to know where a clit is.  You don't need to know the mechanics.  No.  When you gotta dick that thing.  That's right.  That's true.  You know what I mean?  Okay.  Tell me, when you...  A big, meaty pussy...  Yeah, I love that.  That's shit, man.  They get really turned on.  And the only...  It has heard Jim talk about it on the show before.  Yeah, it's just like the labia.  Yeah.  That's why I fucking said it.  Yeah, it's the labia.  When you said it pops out, I'm thinking, I mean, the clit...  That's everybody thinks.  The clit gets swollen. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, now you know it's the labia?  Yeah.  You didn't know it 20 minutes ago.  He's the sexpert.  You weren't sure if it was the clit.  Does she shave it all?  Matt's a sexpert.  Yeah, she shaves it.  Yeah.  But does it bulge in thongs?  I do, too.  Yeah.  Does it bulge in thongs?  He's having full sex with you again.  It does bulge out, yeah.  You gotta get me pictures, dude.  He's a moron with a big dick.  Just fucking tell her.  Don't...  No face.  Just snap with the cell phone.  All right.  I'll have to get her really drunk.  That's hot.  Fucking love a meaty pussy.  Just show her that big dick of yours.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You want this big boy. 
[02:47:30]  Put a little fucking cloth over it.  Don't look like a photographer in 1910.  Anything else, Matt?  You all right?  Yeah.  Don't ask him if there's anything else, because he'll come up with some other bullshit that  nobody asked him.  Just to stay on fucking...  I mean, uh...  Jeff in Buffalo goes, why is Jimmy coddling this fuck?  Because Jimmy's having phone sex with Matt.  I like Matt.  I actually like Matt.  I do.  I like Matt.  Not in a gay way, but he's getting shit out of Matt that he will use to his advantage  later.  All I'm trying to do is find out about this girl's meaty vagina. 
[02:48:00]  I can listen to someone talking about a hot chick's meaty pussy until the cows come  home.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, he's going to jerk off to Matt's stories.  Everyone's writing on Twitter, damn, that's a big dick.  Damn, that's a big dick.  It was so out of nowhere.  You're home yet, Eros.  Never.  He's just sitting in there.  Really?  He didn't deserve that.  Being lumpish.  I love when a girl's laying down, and you fuck her. 
[02:48:30]  You fuck her in the mouth?  I like that, too.  Sure.  It's just something very, like...  Yeah, coffin-like about it.  There's something very invalid-like.  Something very, like, raw and rapey about it.  Yeah, it's hot.  Yeah, it really is.  You know, you asked that thing that pops out when you're licking a pussy?  Yes.  This fucking guy on Twitter is going to get some credit today.  It's a sign that's his bank.  I've never seen this before.  Was it this?  Hold on, let me make sure it's playing.  All right.  Was it a rip?  Oh, come on.  What's wrong with the motherfuckers? 
[02:49:00]  You got an iPhone there?  Oh, that's right.  Was it this?  Oh, my God.  That's it.  That's it.  That's funny.  Is that the clitoris?  Obviously, it starts out looking like a pussy, and then a big, huge dick pops out.  I'm so glad I didn't say nice lips.  Jerks to...  Oh, okay.  Jerkstore, Sean.  How does that even hurt?  Jerkstore.  If you want to see what I just saw and the rest of the guys saw, go to Jerkstore, Sean.  Who's this?  You're with one of your boys.  I was just, uh...  We're picking up chicks. 
[02:49:30]  We're big dicks.  Watch out for those...  Good thing he wears long shorts.  You know what would happen.  Sam, what's going on in that picture?  Beach studs.  Well, you got the one guy with his aviators on, just like, yeah, I got a drink in my hand.  And then Matt, he's on the beach, and he's like, man, this won't be no problem for me,  because I got a nice big dick in my hand.  The wind is blowing.  His left titty is dangling.  He's like, I'm hot, Matt, 69.  I'm hot, Matt, 69, and my dick is big enough to make up for these titties on my chest. 
[02:50:00]  Where were you in this picture?  That was Tel Aviv on the beach.  Oh, okay.  Who's taking the picture?  Tel Aviv.  That's what he was telling us.  Yeah, I think it was Tel Aviv a secret or something.  Oh, yeah.  Now we understand why you don't have time to find a job.  You're too busy traveling the world.  And jerking off.  Like a world traveler who comes on his face and fucking your own titties.  Fucking big dick.  And how old were you when you got to see, like, I don't know, a foreign fucking country? 
[02:50:30]  I never did.  To this day, right?  Fucking Tijuana.  Because you can't really count the Caribbean.  I was on cruises in the Caribbean and shit like that, but as far as Europe goes, or Australia,  Japan, never been to those places.  Oh, wait, I went to Greece.  I think Jim was hypothesizing that he may have grown his titties out big so he could  titty fuck himself with a big dick.  Is that why you grew your titties out so big?  No, I was kind of fat then.  Sam, can we find another photo from his Facebook page?  Because I like when you describe his pictures. 
[02:51:00]  I don't see why not.  Yeah, there's another one.  Why is Chippa Bombs commenting on my photo?  Chippa Bombs.  Oh, boy, they might be taking over your face.  Because I got a new band.  That's why.  What's going on in this picture, Sam?  Oh, they met the Lens Crafters.  He's right.  Dude, they have glasses.  The chick that shot Garb.  He's standing with him.  Yeah, that chick is ugly, by the way.  She is.  I hope it's tiny sister.  She sucked a good dick, though, right?  Where was that?  No, nothing happened with her.  Looks like someone that leaves a lot of voicemails.  That was also totally true. 
[02:51:30]  You know, Matt.  She finally gone?  She finally gone?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's an ancient history.  Who's this broad, Matt, before Sam describes the picture for everybody?  That was just the random.  I think she was sitting on the beach reading a book.  What is she wearing?  Sunblock 1500?  What a white face.  It's not even a person.  It's a ghost.  Is this Tel Aviv, too?  Yes.  Is she Israeli?  I think she was actually English.  Of course she is.  Is Handily? 
[02:52:00]  No, Israeli.  Sam, describe the picture that's on his Facebook page.  He's really, he just found some random chick on the beach.  It doesn't matter who it is.  She's reading a book, and I've got a t-shirt on to cover up my fat torso on the beach, but  the sun's setting, and this chick may be random, but she's going to want a piece of that big  Matt dick.  But he's holding up the camera, taking his own pick.  Hey, I'll take it myself.  We don't need a third wheel around, baby.  Look what we do.  A third wheel.  Where did you meet this witch chin whore? 
[02:52:30]  I'll take my own sunset picture with me and you.  Me and you, babe.  What's your name?  Does it matter?  Yeah.  If the camera had been back a little, you'd see her broom.  What a fucking witchy poop.  She is pretty ugly.  Where did you find her?  She was just sitting, reading a book.  And I just started talking to her.  Wow.  Are you a dick dragging around the beach?  What did you say?  What's that thing in your hands?  He doesn't read.  She was reading a book.  I'm implying he's stupid. 
[02:53:00]  It's funny.  She had a clit in the other hand.  What are those foreign objects you're holding?  I get text messages every time Matt, the intern, is on from just random people listening  to the show.  People hate him so much that Twitter and feedback isn't enough.  People are texting.  Demanding.  Is your mom texting?  No.  Not yet.  Asking for photos?  Yeah.  I keep hearing about this giant dick.  I finally signed up for Twitter today.  We didn't ask you.  No, I wanted to know.  No, no, no.  You should plug his Twitter on the air. 
[02:53:30]  The only reason Jimmy wants to know is because he wants to have more phone sex with Matt.  Not because it's a gay thing.  Because he's getting info from Matt.  People are like, yes, plug it.  Please.  What's your Twitter?  Twitter.com slash intern Matt.  Intern Matt?  Okay.  Intern Matt.  You were able to get intern Matt.  Yeah, I couldn't believe it.  Jesus Christ.  Luckily.  Damn.  Intern Matt.  Is that 69 on that or anything?  No, I didn't think of that.  By the way, the intern boss, E-Rock, just said in my ear, so what's Twitter.com slash intern Matt going to do in a month when he's not invited back?  I know, then in turn we'll see. 
[02:54:00]  A lot of girls on Twitter checking in saying, if you're saying you got seven, that means you got maybe five.  That is not true.  I'm being honest about you.  Women are used to hearing that shit.  They're telling me that means you got five.  You should get rid of that purple egg picture and take a picture of that dick.  I should.  A-Wolf Anger says, um, he's not seven, he's probably five.  Attention, war.  You're being called.  You want me to bring in a cockpit?  No, I don't want a cockpit.  I want a picture of the chick's pussy, though, not your cock. 
[02:54:30]  I have 2,000 of my own cock.  Wait, let me.  Oh, God, if I suggest this.  This isn't going to be good.  Well, what if he, I don't know, fucking just had his underwear on right now.  I don't want to see his penis bulge.  It's just creepy.  He wants to prove he's got a big dick.  Oh, God, no.  Or maybe he could pull his pants up and give himself, like, a male camel toe.  And that doesn't even have to take him off.  Yeah.  Just pull your jeans up, you know?  And see that nice, fat bulge.  Pull your jeans up, you know.  I guess in a way I want to know, because I really don't think he has anywhere.  We can't get the...  No, I think he's packing okay, though. 
[02:55:00]  He doesn't have a tiny little fucking...  Because his head is really round and he's weird looking, so God bless him.  You'll be a little Lego person.  What's your nationality?  White.  I mean, I got...  Oh, what do you got in there?  What makes you good?  What's your nationality?  Because, like, Italians have been known to have bigger fucking sausages.  A brazo.  Right.  So what do you got?  Russian, German, Lithuanian, Italian, Irish.  What, are you in a hurry or something?  Well, I got it.  There might be some combos in there that would make a big dick. 
[02:55:30]  You bet there are.  There's some kind of ingredients in there, because that's what came out.  Sam, can you do another Facebook page?  I want you to describe another Facebook page.  Oh, I was trying to read his...  Hot Matt 69.  ...Twitter mentions, now that he's plugged it.  Yeah, I want to...  Here, one more Facebook fucking picture.  Tell me what's going on.  Oh!  You found a good one?  Oh, I don't care.  What's going on here?  Is this Tel Aviv again?  It's already happening.  Yes, sir!  All right, here we go.  Ladies!  That should just be entitled Ladies!  Ladies!  We got...  There's a reason they call them Love Handles. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, fuck!  Oh, shit!  That was a little foul.  Wow.  I guess they were starting the big dick show in a few minutes.  All those chairs are set up in the background.  Everyone wants to see the big dick show.  Sam, what do you got on this?  A bunch of awful yellow chairs.  What do you got on this picture?  Don't worry about it, ladies.  You both can get in on this one.  Yeah, and I'll remind you that later on, there's enough dick to go around.  Yeah, there's a lady on each side of him here.  He's got his shirt off, his shorts on.  They're on the beach.  They're in bikini tops and little shorts. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  And he's got his arms around both ladies.  No problem.  We're on the beach.  Yeah.  Too much dick to be kissed.  Too much time.  Saddled down by one lady.  Easy, girls.  Easy.  Plenty of dick to go around.  What was happening on that fucking empty beach?  What was there, a guy with a bomb belt running around?  The emptiest beach I've ever seen.  Is that shadow from your big dick?  Maybe.  Got a big dick shadow. 
[02:57:00]  Seven legs in this picture.  And a six of ours in my dick.  I hate those fucking yellow chairs.  Just mocking how empty it is.  It's very nice.  It's not nice, it's empty.  There's no one there.  Brody starts shooting into his dick.  Thinks it's a great white.  Exactly.  He's got a fucking oxygen tank in his cock hole.  It's alright, chief.  It's alright, it's Matt's dick.  It's just Matt's dick.  I don't want to open up that fish and have that big delicious dick falling out all over the dock. 
[02:57:30]  Everybody will sit on it.  Chipper bombs commented on this picture.  She put her mouth on my big dick and then I came in her clit.  Ah, shit.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  That's idiot.  Ryan in the Bronx.  Yeah, let's let Ryan give you a little lesson today there, Matt.  Ryan, go ahead, sir.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Matt, you're a fag git.  If I was in a picture of yourself in a bar with a bunch of dudes, within a half hour conversation, 
[02:58:00]  you, A, offer the information that you have no idea where the clit is.  You come in your own face.  Hey, I have a big dick, and would you guys like me to bring a picture of it in?  You're a fag, dude.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, yeah, she blew me.  I was fucked there, and my boy was videotaping.  The fact that he's like, I got a big dick, do you want me to bring a picture in?  No, dummy, they want you to bring a picture of the chick's pussy, and they made that clear already.  Yeah, I know.  We all heard that. 
[02:58:30]  So what's your point?  The point is you're a fag.  Do you fucking dot your eyes with a heart, you little queer?  Yeah, exactly.  This is so fucking rude.  I've been off the air.  I thought Sam was annoying.  I'll fucking take two hours of him over you, you prick.  I don't think two hours.  I'm loving Sam's bit where he describes the Facebook pics.  Yeah, the pictures.  You got another one, Sam, maybe?  I love them pictures.  We need a different scenario.  Enough of the beach ones.  Yeah, he's got a lot of beach pictures.  Let's see, is there another one worth describing?  Never has someone in such bad shape been shirtless in so many times. 
[02:59:00]  It's fucking amazing.  There we go.  Oh, shit.  A little fun picture on Facebook.  Show him you got a sense of humor.  He's got his hair spiked up, and he's sticking out his tongue, and he's saying,  Ladies, I may not know where to put this tongue, but I got a nice big dick that'll take care of that.  He's saying right now, get over here, put your pussy in my face, I'll lick your ankle.  Please direct your clit to my tongue, because I don't know where it is. 
[02:59:30]  And then jump up and down real fast.  I'll just leave my tongue hanging out like I just want a big medal at a special Olympic event.  I think you got a really small tongue, by the way.  Exactly.  Don't cry, Sam, though.  You're a one-stamper.  Oh, look, he's got a tiny tongue.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah, man.  A little tongue McGillicuddy.  That's creepy.  I don't need a big tongue.  I let my dick do the talking.  Yeah.  You might have...  What about the one where they're in, like...  Oh, this one.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:00:00]  All right, Sam, another face.  She's hot.  Who's that shit?  That was on the Australia trip.  She was...  I never did anything with her.  Was she Australian?  No, she was from my school.  Why didn't you do anything with her?  What's wrong with you?  I don't know, because she was like...  Wait, wait.  I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because unlike the women you meet on these trips, she fucking knows you.  Yes.  And knows you're an asshole.  Why?  These other women, you get them on the fucking trips, and you meet them there in Israel and  stuff, and maybe you could put up a good front for like an hour or two, but that chick 
[03:00:30]  knows you're a...  She knows the real Matt.  You're a douche.  An idiot.  She knows you don't have a big dick.  That's it.  You just don't talk.  I mean, she was on the trip, and she was like the cool thing.  The cool, like, hot girl on the trip.  Oh, yeah?  She's a movie.  Yeah.  I just...  I never got it done.  You got a lot of pussy, Matt.  I do my fair share.  I do all right with this dick.  Hey, if you had a dick this big, you'd do all right, too.  Yeah.  I bet Matt does good, because he's a good talker. 
[03:01:00]  Sam, you're going to describe this picture, though?  Yeah, I mean, Jim was right, though.  Matt, he's a good talker, but he makes a good first impression.  Don't hate the plague.  I hate the dick.  I got a big dick.  I'm sure within a week of getting to know Matt, big dick or no big dick, no girls talking  to him.  No, but he could probably talk his way into pussy, because he's a smart dude, and it's  like...  It's after the second or third date, they're like, why did I fuck him?  Like, when they see that the head is all...  Don't hold it against me, because I got a big dick.  I'm very physical in my approach. 
[03:01:30]  I just started physically...  We didn't ask you.  That's cool.  So is Richard Speck.  Yeah, it's called rape.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe you're physical in your approach.  Now we understand why he doesn't know the definition of rape from earlier.  Like, if I'm talking to a girl in a bar, the next step is to get her outside, like, you  know, somewhere.  Sure, chloroform.  Away from anywhere else, and just start making out of there.  Yeah, he'd probably...  You know what?  And then somehow get her home, or get her in an alleyway, or get her somewhere.  Get her somewhere where no one will hear her scream. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Get her in the bathroom.  But he's nice.  Put her up on the changing station.  Oh, a nice man takes you into the fucking toilet?  Yeah.  Toilet.  He knows how to...  What was the guy's name?  What was his name?  Or Nesto, or he knows how to treat a lady.  A lady.  By taking you to the toilet.  Toilet.  I like Fernando.  Fernando.  I like Fernando.  He's nice.  He knows how to treat a lady.  Fernando.  By getting her a shitty perm. 
[03:02:30]  Fucking perm.  Awful perm.  Hey, two days ago, she says, mother to...  Your mama to tell us, this stupid mother talking all backwards.  Shut up, mother, she says to me.  We got it, Yoda.  All right.  That was good.  We got a lot of information about Occupy Wall Street.  That was from Scarface.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Exactly.  You ever see Scarface?  I did.  I saw it once.  Once.  Once.  What kind of man are you? 
[03:03:00]  You see that once?  Once.  Too busy fucking.  Exactly.  Finger and checks.  A real man fucks while he's watching.  Aw, shit.  That's how I roll.  The only movie I watch are the ones projected on my dick.  Yeah.  Yeah, he loves train movies because the train goes along his dick nicely.  Look at this horrendous product.  Oh, my God.  Andy Dick is on television.  Kathleen Hall or something.  What is that?  She's terrible.  New website creates parodies of deceptive political ads.  That's kind of cool.  She's a hoot.  That's funny. 
[03:03:30]  Wow, she horrendous.  Her fucking.  That's a man.  This is different than a lot of ad watches in the past.  And, look, you were the person that helped encourage one of those papers to do the ad watch boxes and some of the things on television, but always went into the specific facts and got into the policy.  You actually want to get into almost the visual deception a little bit.  We want to be able to focus the viewer on the techniques that are being used to advance the deception so that when they see it in other ads, they'll recognize it as well.  A fucking horrible dude and a mock turtleneck. 
[03:04:00]  And a big dick.  She dresses like my agent.  Man or woman, she'd appreciate my big dick.  That's true.  You'd turn her around, I bet.  Who does her hair look like?  That fucking hairdo is enraging.  She has a man's part.  Women don't have...  Women don't part their hair like men.  She's got the swoop in front.  Who does that fucking hairdo look like?  Hitler.  Yeah, when he's at the eagle's nest trying to relax.  Yeah, the little swoop in front.  Do you like older girls or younger girls?  Oh, my God.  The interview starts.  He's fetching a question.  I like younger because I'm 43. 
[03:04:30]  I would fuck somebody older, but it's rare.  It's always been rare for me.  I don't like them older, man.  What's the oldest you ever...  15?  No, that's Anthony.  Hey, look at the wall.  It's Opie, Anthony, and Matt.  What do you expect?  He's just giving you a ribbon, throwing some barbs at each other.  Sure, why not?  Just working the room.  I don't know the oldest, man.  I'm not sure because it would have to depend on the chick.  Yeah.  For me, I think it was 39.  No one asked.  Nobody cares. 
[03:05:00]  Nobody asked.  Oh, that I did ever fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or just even full-round.  I've had masseuses that were in their late 40s, early 50s, but never older than that.  I don't go for that shit.  Do you have to pay them extra?  Of course.  What, do you think they do it for God and country?  Of course.  Fucking A, you have to pay them.  That's the beauty of it.  It wouldn't be fun if they did it because they like me.  It's never just like a free handjob?  No!  Who wants that?  There's something better about them having to fucking put the extra money in their pocket  and leave. 
[03:05:30]  Oh!  See, I'd want it for free.  Here's your hat.  What's your hurry?  For Nagel or in the Guinness for free?  For Nagel.  Don't bring up Nagel.  Exactly.  For Nagel.  The sex man is married.  That's when you bungle a blowjob.  Sorry, Eric.  Can we get Matt out of here now?  Yeah, I would love to.  Fucking Matt rules.  What?  Great segment.  Thanks to Matt.  I don't think so.  It was all right.  Edit this.  Maybe we'll cut it down a little bit.  No, I think Matt fucking kicks ass.  He comes in.  He talks on the air.  He's good.  And we learn he has a big ass.  He kicks ass.  Doesn't lick ass, though. 
[03:06:00]  Right?  Yeah.  Learn that.  Not yet.  You will.  What are you, 24?  I just turned 25.  You got that fucking girl that you were showing pictures of and you haven't fucking tongued  her ass?  No.  You're crazy.  You're fucking.  You know what?  Let me see the meaty pussy first, though.  Maybe he's too busy fucking trying to figure out what goes where.  A man that does not lick ass is not a real man.  Or if he should hang himself with her labia.  He's struck by a big dick by his own cum.  He doesn't lick anything. 
[03:06:30]  Matt's not licking anything.  If you had a dick that size, I mean a really big dick, as was described by Matt, you'd  just use the dick.  Do you have a tooler in the ass with that fucking monster?  No.  I've only fucked in the ass, like, twice.  Yeah?  Were you able to sit down?  I knew those two.  So you fucked in the ass twice.  Yeah.  One was my first girlfriend who I lost my virginity to.  Oh.  Cool.  Well, technically, I lost my virginity to a hooker in Kansas. 
[03:07:00]  I was in Curacao when I was 17.  Oh, that's good.  Well, that's real.  Enjoy AIDS.  Where's that place?  It's near Aruba.  It's a...  Jesus Christ.  I went to visit my cousin there.  Yeah, that's what happens.  It's not just the neighbor next door drunkenly fucking blowing you with something.  Right.  He's in Aruba, Curacao.  Oh, he's losing his virginity.  You're a privileged douche.  God.  I bet he's got a big dick.  Of course you don't have a fucking time.  He doesn't need a passport.  He just shows that big dick in customs.  Oh, yeah.  A really big dick. 
[03:07:30]  He'll let him mosey on through.  A really big dick.  Thanks for bringing that gift into our nation.  Ha, ha, ha.  Gift.  My gift to your nation.  I'm fucking flabbergasted with this whole thing.  So you fucking, uh, and who was the other one?  You fucked the one girlfriend in the duker, and how about the other one?  Wait, you said technically you lost your virginity.  That's a little weird.  What happened?  Well, because there was a condom involved, and I was really wasted, and she was black, 
[03:08:00]  and I really wasn't that hard.  I came, but it wasn't that hard.  You're packing like a fucking soggy fort?  Yeah.  So you're saying blacks aren't a real human being.  I don't think I said that.  You kind of are.  What is...  Yeah, you're not saying technically you didn't lose your virginity to it, or you did.  No, I did.  You fucked it with a bag on, you couldn't keep a rod?  I did.  I still can't.  Guess how much it cost.  It was $10.  What's the...  What's the...  U.S.?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So you don't think you're having sex if you're wearing a bag? 
[03:08:30]  I don't like to wear a condom.  But where's the technically come in?  Well, because she was a prostitute.  Because she was a prostitute.  Doesn't matter.  You lost your virginity.  You lost your virginity.  That's the best way to be, man.  It's a mechanical thing.  Get hookers.  It's very mechanical.  It has nothing to do with emotion.  Yeah.  It gives me virginity.  Yeah.  I guess.  You just got to get it out.  Yeah.  The other thing I've never done...  We didn't ask.  It doesn't matter.  Well, now we got to know.  It just doesn't matter.  What's the other thing?  Who cares?  I always wanted to have a threesome.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[03:09:00]  I always wanted to have a threesome.  Like, so much of his life has gone by in my 25 years.  It's too bad.  It's not going to happen.  You have, right?  Now that you're over the hill.  Exactly.  I've only had sex with this one guy right here.  Mine was documented in the Daily News.  On the post.  You and two girls?  Mine cost me fucking millions of dollars.  I've fucked...  I've pulled a lot of trains with friends, but I've done a few with two girls.  Yeah.  They're hotter sexually, although the train with my buddies was more fun because, you  know...  It's just degrading, right? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  The fuck is he talking about?  You're really endearing yourself.  This guy rapes chicks, man.  I know.  Exactly.  He's doing nothing but winning the over.  I would look into his past, yeah.  I think there's some fucking...  I shouldn't say that.  I have no idea.  ...shenanigans.  He might.  My suspicions.  He could.  He should.  If you don't get to it.  Probably does.  You ever do anything that you would have considered date rape?  Um...  Not technically.  No, not technically.  Were you wearing a bag? 
[03:10:00]  Exactly.  No.  What's the closest you came to date rape?  The question should never be answered with, um...  No.  Well, I mean...  Yes.  There's been situations where, you know, like, afterwards, you know, the girl's like...  Like, this happened, like...  Can I go home, mister?  This happened a couple months ago.  This girl I was staying with when I first moved here, she was like...  She was like, you raped me.  No, no, no.  She's like, oh, because...  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  Because, like...  That's scary.  Yeah, it kind of was.  That's why I raped her. 
[03:10:30]  I mean, I didn't.  You know, I mean, I went...  You know, I obviously...  She was kind of a small girl, and, you know, I started making out with her, and I started  fingering her, and I fucked her.  And then we fucked for two weeks after that.  And then when I leave, she starts saying, oh, you raped me.  It wasn't consensual.  Oh, all right.  It's...  Gotta be careful.  Yeah.  So what happened?  How'd that end?  You're gonna kill her?  No.  Oh, okay.  Just raped her again.  Bludgeoning her with that big dick.  That's scary shit, man.  Yeah.  But no, you know, it's okay.  She laid off?  Yeah.  This is good. 
[03:11:00]  Well, good.  Maybe you'll get that threesome.  Maybe you'll lick ass.  Yeah.  Maybe you'll find the clit.  Yeah.  And maybe you'll hold on to that big, really big dick of yours.  Yeah.  Where's your next trip?  I think I want to go to South America.  God, please.  Like, I'd love to go to, like, Colombia.  Oh, there you go.  Brazil.  Because Salsa said so?  Yeah.  Omar's okay.  That's a big dick.  I hope you take a helicopter ride by the neck. 
[03:11:30]  I like you, Matt.  There is no lying to you.  Don't fuck me, Matt.  All I got in life is my word and my big dick.  I was going to go to, like, Russia and, like, Ukraine.  It's just Ukraine.  How about you bulldozer?  Do you hear what I said, Ant?  I heard that.  That was good.  I think it would be really easy to get pussy, like, in Eastern Europe.  Hey, when you got a dick that big, it's easy to get it anywhere. 
[03:12:00]  Just give them a shekel.  Some fucking old school.  Yeah, they'll fuck you for soup over there.  When you're raping broads, it's easy to get pussy anywhere.  Well, you don't need to travel out of the country.  When you don't need an okay.  Right.  So South America.  Oh, that's horrible.  Hey, my new band is going to play at the Opie and Anthony Thanksgiving show.  Oh, yeah?  You have a new band?  New band?  Yeah, I'm starting a crazy one.  Really?  What happened to your old band?  They're still around, but the new one's just too hardcore. 
[03:12:30]  Burning Embers broke up?  They're around, but it was just...  What's the new one?  The SFPs.  The S-S-P's?  The S-F-P's.  The S-F-P's?  What kind of music?  What does it stand for?  It's crazy.  The Sick Fucking Puppies?  You are hardcore, Chip.  Chip's an asshole.  What kind of music?  Just kind of crazy, fast thrash.  Yeah.  Like that?  Yeah.  Like metal?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You play the drums? 
[03:13:00]  I play bass drums and I sing.  Conducting an interview.  And I got cymbals on my legs.  Oh, yeah?  He gave me a chance to eat something.  I don't give a fuck.  No, I know.  Yeah.  He just has to talk.  I'm doing the same thing.  Do you have a harmonica?  What's that?  A harmonica?  No.  What the fuck's he talking about?  Where's this going?  I got a...  Nowhere.  A hot Jennifer.  What?  That's the thing about Matt.  He doesn't have to worry about stuff going somewhere.  He just likes to talk.  He has to worry now.  It's the Opie Anthony Matt show.  Yeah, that's right.  Shirt's got a bunch of stripes on it.  What is it?  Gum or something? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, like fruit stripe gum.  Stripe's gum?  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be striped shirt day or something.  Why would I say that?  That's not funny.  I know.  Sorry.  What are you eating turkey chili?  No, I'm eating chicken noodle soup there, Chip.  Oh, maybe you should make it be brave.  Oh, that's terrible.  Chip, what are you doing for Thanksgiving?  Oh, shut up, Matt.  God, Matt.  You're taking one break.  Yeah, I'm going to probably have some turkey or something.  My uncle used to kiss my feet and go, blah, blah, blah.  Turkey.  Uncle Paul?  I used to hate that. 
[03:14:00]  Make my WiiWa stand up.  Really?  We're approaching two hours without a break.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  James in Kansas, how can Matt fuck so much and not know where a clit is?  Well, when you're raping, bitches, you're not worried about their pleasure.  Exactly.  It's all about that big dick.  It's like looking at stuff from an airplane.  You don't know which building is which.  You know what I'm saying?  You're way up there.  It's really big, so it blocks the clit.  I do always like to make them cum, too.  Matt drives a proud Volkswagen with no passenger seat.  I think we have found the perfect man. 
[03:14:30]  He really is.  Matt, the intern.  He's got a big dick.  He travels.  Girls love him.  He knows how to satisfy them.  He has all the facts.  He has all the facts about Occupy Wall Street.  He's the perfect fucking man.  He's got his own radio show.  Yeah, that's right.  And I don't know if Matt rapes.  I have no idea.  I would speculate he does.  He's been accused of it.  I'd speculate that there's probably been some instances where a girl might have been a little sleepier than she should have been to consent. 
[03:15:00]  So what?  Maybe a girl is a little more drugged out.  She knew what she was in for.  A lot of times, girls will get themselves really drunk.  In order for it to happen.  Because they don't want to think, oh, I'm a slut.  Plus, they've got to numb themselves.  They've got to numb themselves down before they can handle that big old dick.  Exactly.  That's true.  He carries Novocaine with him.  He just shoots up their pussy and says, don't worry.  This won't hurt a bit.  Well, they put laughing gas over their clit.  It is kind of hot.  I mean, it's kind of sick, but it's kind of hot when she's like, no, it hurts. 
[03:15:30]  It hurts.  Yeah, it sure is.  Little feet are kicking.  Jesus.  There are people who want you to talk about them.  I know.  Matt rules.  All right, we got it.  I'm team Matt.  Matt, leave.  You know that?  Leave.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Good job.  Good job.  Live.  Skating contest.  Live.  Yes.  Live.  Skating contest.  Live.  This is the part where he stays.  He's 30 seconds after you ask him to leave.  Live.  Yeah, but there should be a skating contest.  He's right. 
[03:16:00]  Someone says, I hope the shit show is all commercials.  Yeah.  Live.  All right, we got to take a quick break, right?  More than a quick break.  All right.  I have a really big dick, so I'm a very good fight.  Yeah.  How many are you packing?  About seven.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  What are you doing? 
[03:16:30]  Argentium?  Is that how you say it?  Argentium.  All right.  Argentium.  What is Argentium?  Does anyone know what Argentium is?  I'll tell you what it is.  It's Steven Singer's new super silver collection.  That's what he's selling now, huh?  Yep.  I just know that I went down to Walnut in, what was it, 8th?  8th and Walnut, and it's a terrific area, and I love going to Steven Singer.  He took care of me very, very recently, and I loved what he did for me. 
[03:17:00]  The guy knows how to do this shit, but I guess he's really promoting this.  Argentium.  Argentium.  That's right.  Steven Singer's brand-new collection of silver is made from Argentium.  Do we learn what that is?  Yeah.  The king of all silver metals?  Why is Argentium the king of all silver metals?  Do we know?  Opie, read on.  Okay.  This brand-new collection of super silver starts at just $149.  Argentium is more pure than sterling silver, but I thought sterling silver was the best. 
[03:17:30]  This is one better?  Yes.  One more better.  Damn.  This silver goes to 11.  It goes to 11.  Brighter than platinum, white gold, and sterling silver.  Low maintenance, tarnish resistant, and Argentium is responsible and ethical.  What does that mean?  Read on, Opie.  But I don't give a fuck where they get this shit from.  I don't either, but...  I guess Steven Singer cares, though.  It's recycled.  All right.  Why?  Well, it's produced using only recycled silver. 
[03:18:00]  Where are they getting the silver from?  Old silver.  Uh-oh.  But then they get the others...  Did he find a pile somewhere?  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Fillings?  Did he discover a pile?  Oh, my God.  Maybe he doesn't want us to...  Steven's out at, like, 3 in the morning around Philly just prying people's teeth out.  The homeless at Love Park?  Look, I'll go local for everybody.  Love Park.  He's yanking the fillings out of the homeless. 
[03:18:30]  Then he goes to City Hall to the Occupy Philly.  He's getting fucking fillings over there, too.  It's produced using only recycled silver.  I said that already, didn't I?  How do you check it out?  You go to IHateStevenSinger.com on the web.  No, I was going to answer myself.  Oh.  You don't even have to move.  No.  Oh, see, I wasn't moving.  I thought I was going to magically appear.  I don't know. 
[03:19:00]  You don't stay still and get it.  It says you don't even have to move.  I think he means that figuratively.

[03:19:30]  Oh, man.  I almost had a perfect read.  I fucked it up at the end.  Or in person at the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  What's that?  I watched it.  Why?  You went to the bathroom?  Yeah.  I thought I was rushing back to make sure we were back in time for the next one.  It's not long.  It's called concise.  We're taking care of the client.  Look, I love Steven Singer. 
[03:20:00]  And I hate Steven Singer at the same time, so I support it.  I'm just saying it.  Ah, see?  You know what I love about Steven Singer?  What?  He's so goddamn good.  He decided, I don't need to be there when Opie shows up.  He wasn't there.  Oh, shit.  I mean, one of his lockies take care of me.  Yeah, but you had Turbo Joe.  Oh, shit.  Huh?  You had Turbo Joe, right?  I had Turbo Joe.  I like Turbo Joe.  Doesn't talk your ear off.  No, but he's got a lot of energy.  That's why they call him Turbo Joe.  Sure does.  And they got sugar-free cookies down there.  I don't know if that's possible, but that's what they told me. 
[03:20:30]  I don't go for those ones.  Did you fall for the sugar-free cookies?  No, the real cookies are the ones I go for.  I'm not a lady.  I hate Steven Singer.com.  Mysterious XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Running out of show, man.  Yeah.  Hey, quickly.  We're going to lose Joe Frazier.  Yeah.  Not sooner than later.  He has liver cancer and he's in a hospice already.  Oh, boy. 
[03:21:00]  Smoking Joe.  Yeah.  Old Smoking Joe Frazier.  He's not doing too well.  No.  No, he's not, Andy.  Oh, God.  You ever notice how uncomfortable you get when you're laying on a satin pillow with your arms  folded on your chest?  Oh, shit.  You ever notice how hard it is to nap when people are throwing roses on you?  You ever notice how cold you feel even when the heat's up because they're pumping formaldehyde 
[03:21:30]  into you?  You ever notice how cold formaldehyde is?  You ever notice how sleepy you get when you're hearing organ music and people crying?  I hate that.  Don't you hate when an angel shows up and says, Ed Bradley has a message for you?  Yeah.  I had a little mishap during surgery. 
[03:22:00]  Does anyone know what he was in for?  I went in to have a cuticle removed and they threw a toe tag on me.  You ever notice how uncomfortable that is?  Well, I lost Andy Rooney over the weekend, 92.  Andy Rooney.  Chet.  And this very show, we called it.  We call a lot of things.  Sure, he enjoyed his retirement.  Wow. 
[03:22:30]  I took a nice retirement and went on a five-hour vacation.  Then I died.  You ever notice how much death ruins a vacation?  Do you ever notice how mad your wife gets in the airport when you die before you get  on the plane?  Do you ever notice how embarrassing that is?  When you're finally letting her fly first class, but instead you have to be yelling,  ouch, and holding your chest.  Do you ever notice how embarrassing that is? 
[03:23:00]  Next thing you know, you're flying with the cargo.  Don't you hate when you go somewhere in first class and fly back in the bottom of the plane?  You ever notice how cold that is?  I did.  Looks like a seat became available.  You ever float above the plane and watch your wife chatting up a black gentleman in what  was supposed to be your seat?  You ever see that and get an erection in death?  Well, here's us pretty much calling it, what, a mere month ago? 
[03:23:30]  Right?  Right, when he retired.  I never called this stuff right.  You did.  I didn't.  Well, this is obvious.  I mean, I would love to fucking pat myself on the back, but this shit, this one was so  obvious.  He would have never retired.  Why would you like to pat yourself on the back that you said someone was going to die  and they did?  You ever notice when people are so big on taking credit, they're happy you actually died?  Good point.  No, I mean the other shit, like the Occupy, Vancouver, shut down, over death, like that 
[03:24:00]  type of shit.  This one was so obvious this was going to happen, that's all I'm saying.  Hit it, the old codger.  He's doing his own obituary.  Yeah, he's pretty much doing his own obit.  I wonder if he has an embassion, his breathing sounds weird.  Yeah, he probably has lung cancer.  He'll be dead in a year.  As in for Andy Rooney.  Yeah.  That was a nice sign off, though.  Dead within a year.  That's what happens to the people that have to retire.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yep.  Arrivederci.  Arrivederci. 
[03:24:30]  Let's go home.  Wow.  That was something.  Then we did a, this is the long form one that's better.  We were just obsessed when we learned that Andy Rooney retired.  We were like, the guy's going to die very soon.  Out of nowhere, he retired.  I was being polite by saying within a year.  Obvious.  I wish I said within the year.  That would have been a much more impressive prediction.  Andy Rooney's going to be dead in a year.  I just want to go on record and say that.  They're giving him that long?  Yeah, that's why.  That's why he's leaving. 
[03:25:00]  They're giving him the old GLB.  Well, there's quite the drop off between last year and this year.  Yeah.  And he had, what do you call it, the death rattle voice?  Death rattle voice.  It's weird.  Remember Andy Rooney when he talked like this?  Unbelievable things happening and I'm talking about it.  And he's like, there's 30 years I've been doing this and I, when you see me out at dinner,  I just don't like to be annoyed.  Anyways, it's like, that's not Andy Rooney. 
[03:25:30]  There's too much air you can hear.  It's a death rattle.  I don't want to hear that much air when someone's talking.  Just a death rattle when he talks.  I think that's why he's gone.  I think he might be, I'm just saying.  You think he wants to spend some time with his family?  I think it's AIDS.  AIDS.  He looked like he lost a few pounds there, too.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  Something's going on with Andy Rooney.  Something's happening.  But Godspeed, Andy Rooney.  That was an obvious one, though.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:26:00]  I think, you know.  92.  Fuck, he was only able to be retired, what, a month?  A month and a half, maybe?  Wasn't that early October, I think?  And then not even all that.  He was in the hospital for some amount of time.  What did he go in for?  Does anyone?  He's not really saying.  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It was this minor surgery that went.  Yeah, whoops.  All right.  How about you just leave shit alone when you're that old?  If you're 92, why would you ever go in for minor surgery?  You don't want to go into a hospital.  Why would you do that?  I know.  Whatever it is, live with it. 
[03:26:30]  I like the name of that surgery.  What?  Minor.  Jesus.  Oh.  Yeah.  I was trying to think.  I'm like, what?  What the hiney skin sewed.  They should sew their mouths shut so they don't tell lies.  Tattletales.  But fucking Joe Frazier going out.  Yeah.  Hospice means dead.  That's why Twitter is so frustrating.  People are like, oh, you know, I hope he recovers.  No, when it hits the hospice stage, it's just a matter of time, right? 
[03:27:00]  You don't get out of the hospice?  I don't think so.  You don't ever leave the hospice?  I think it's extremely rare if you get out of hospice.  Hospice.  Dr. Steve would know.  Maybe he could text all of us.  I would call him a hospice.  Make him believe he's texting one of us.  The hospice is one of those things where if you're in the hospital and you have to piss,  it's a hospice.  It's a hospice.  If you have to get flowed everywhere, you go to the hospice.  Yeah.  Like, why is it named that?  We had Frazier on less than a year ago, and he was bragging that he was doing way better 
[03:27:30]  than Ali.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  See?  Remember?  That'll get you.  We got Frazier singing or anything?  You rock?  Yeah.  I have Frazier talking about Muhammad Ali.  Oh, boy.  I have his voicemail for some reason.  We recorded his voicemail.  Not for some reason.  His voicemail is all about making fun of Ali.  I wasn't there that day.  Where were you?  Okay.  Hold on.  Here it is.  Another fake sick day?  Sure.  Oh, shit.  Oh, oh, oh.  What?  Were you watching Meat Loaf or something?  For the record.  No.  No. 
[03:28:00]  No.  What?  For the record.  No.  No.  No.  My name is Smokey and Joe Frazier.  Sharp as a razor.  Yeah.  Floats like a butterfly.  Stings like a bee.  I'm the man.  Then the job.  You know.  Look and see.  Call me.  Bye-bye.  Call me.  I have no idea what he said, by the way.  I have an easier time understanding Roland than that.  He said floats like a butterfly.  Stings like a bee. 
[03:28:30]  I'm the man that did the job.  Look and see.  Oh, shit.  Call me.  Oh, boy.  Joe Frazier.  This is Smoke and Joe Frazier.  I'm sharp as a razor.  Soon to be smoldering Joe Frazier.  Oh, yeah.  Why is he still smoking if he's got liver hats?  So fucking dead.  That sucks.  Joe fucking Frazier.  How old gentleman is he?  40.  I think if you want the real answer, I want to say 67.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  What else you got on the Joe Frazier there, E-Rock?  We have a bunch of the songs he was singing, Isolated.  Six Days on the Road, When a Man Loves a Woman, My Way, Mustang Sally, Ain't No Sense  in Going Home.  What, are you doing an album?  Yeah.  Who's making love to your old lady?  Well, we realized quickly that it was tough to interview the guys.  We're like, just sing a few songs, man.  Nah, he was cool as fuck.  I loved him.  I loved having Frazier on.  It should be my way, and we should do that as we leave.  How long do you give him, Dr. Opie? 
[03:29:30]  This will be within, like, I want to say days.  Wow.  How many days?  Do you want to say days, or do you feel you have to?  I have to say days.  I want to say now.  I have to say days.  And there's nothing...  Well, if he dies quick, you can pat yourself on the back.  But there's nothing surprising here.  I think what happened was, obviously, they wanted to tell the world.  Well, at the end of his life, they were keeping this a secret for a really long time.  He probably even had the early stages when he was in here, because he didn't know. 
[03:30:00]  He just found out a few weeks ago.  Oh, really?  He probably didn't go to the doctor a lot.  I imagine he drank.  Really?  But if he's in a hospice, that means days.  I'm telling you right now.  He had to bail out of the last Chiller Theater Halloween weekend at the very last minute.  He was booked.  Oh, really?  And then at the last minute, they said he couldn't come, and then right after that...  But he's in a hospice.  That means...  He said, you know.  That's it.  Smoking Joe's liver.  No.  Got to at least wait until he's cold.  Or dead. 
[03:30:30]  Well, one or the other.  But he's smoking wacky tobacco or something?  Ah, Jim.  What's that?  You guys want to hear something?  Okay.  This is what regular TV's doing nowadays.  Sucking ass.  Why you got to talk like a gun about it?  They're doing a show called Hillbilly Handjobs.  Who's that?  Hillbilly Hand...  Hillbilly Handjobs?  Yeah, Hillbilly...  It's either Hillbilly Handjobs or Hillbilly Handfisting.  Fishing. 
[03:31:00]  What?  Fishing, I think.  It's Hillbilly Handfishing.  No, fisting.  I don't know.  Is this a typo?  Because it's Hillbilly Handfisting.  Oh, yeah, it's a typo.  No, it's fisting.  I think it's a typo.  It's not a typo.  Listen.  Lissa!  Come on in!  All you hear Skipper say is,  Lissa!  Get out here!  So I knew I was in trouble from the get-go.  You really want him to run up between your legs now.  You've got him caught when you get him between your legs. 
[03:31:30]  You can do it.  You can do it.  I'm telling you, she was just trembling.  I could feel every muscle in her body trembling.  I feel like it's him because he's slippery.  Uh, Lissa is getting stuffed.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah.  I can feel him at the top of my thigh.  Oh, my.  I'm telling you, he's big.  Love you, Lex.  Got it?  Yeah!  Get him out of here! 
[03:32:00]  Get him out of here!  She's so big that she can't even lift it up.  Oh, man.  That's a big old...  There you go.  I told you.  I guess you're right.  Maybe it wasn't a typo.  Hillbilly head fist, dude.  Yeah, that sounded a little sexual.  Sounded like it could have been Matt.  I think it could have been Matt on this show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a big old dick.  That's a big old dick.  Hospice, where they keep you busy till you die, is what Dave's saying.  Yeah. 
[03:32:30]  They try to make the end of your days easy again.  Comfortable.  Comfortable.  Oh, well.  This would be fascinating if it wasn't one after.  Yeah, let's do this, then.  Come on, stay in short.  I've been covering you up all day.  And a fucking Kennedy suit was in better shape than Dallas.  That's the biggest coffee stain ever.  That's a hard stain to get out.  Fuck.  It's impossible.  We're going to talk about the bees.  We're talking about them tomorrow. 
[03:33:00]  Sam, can you make sure we talk about the bees tomorrow?  Talk about the birds, too, you know?  Sex.  S-E-X.  Good spelling.  Jimmy loves the bee story.  That's what my mother would say.  Get out of here, Chipper.  Don't go talking about S-E-X.  But I knew what she was doing.  Doing?  Yeah.  I heard them talking.  They said they was knocking her pussy out.  That's nonsense.  It's your mother.  I know.  My mother.  I'm on overtime.  Just thanked on her.  You know, this week, you have a guess.  You said you were going to look after Nicole's dog on this show. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, great.  This week.  I'm not doing hack radio with anybody.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  You were in a good mood at the end of Friday's show for whatever.  I didn't mean it, though.  You're not going to do it?  No.  Why not?  I love Nicole's dog.  I told her Wednesday for the whole show.  That'd be cute.  We could pet the fucking thing.  She wants me to fucking take care of her dog?  All right.  Okay.  Bring it in.  Wednesday.  Yeah, get her the steak to eat.  Where's Chester?  Yeah, Chester.  Chester learned the hard way.  Yeah.  My friend Chester got in trouble. 
[03:34:00]  All right, Chester.  The damn Hustler magazine.  I remember that.  A bunch of liars.  We ended the show, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go home.  Well, uh...  What?  Let me see what that is.

[03:35:30]  You want to ask this one?  I sure do.  And now, the time is near.  The time is here.  Check my hopes and prepare.  I say to take the dare.  Oh, man, it's time to climb.  Ride through them ropes and face a man.  Have a plan.  But stage that plan.  Not in the shy way.  Well, that's his right. 
[03:36:00]  But come to fight.  Heck, I'll fight in my way.  Here is that sound.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes, it doesn't stop.  It's after O.P. and Anthony Live, and I've just been sitting in here as they've been changing the studio over to get ready for Ron and Fez and listen to all the other interns. 
[03:36:30]  Sal, the O&A intern, and the Ron and Fez interns just shitting all over Matt.  Apparently, they were not impressed with his big day on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Some of you were.  Some of you weren't.  But he does.  Troy was right.  I think it was Troy who went on the After Show and announced to the world that Matt sashays when he walks.  And I've been watching him through the glass, walk up and down the hall.  And he does indeed sashay.  I'm your host, Sam Roberts.  He's trying to counterbalance that big dick of his.  I've heard he's got a big one.  He made that announcement earlier on today's show. 
[03:37:00]  And now, and it was due to O.P., and I'm thinking that maybe part of the reason he was being trashed in here so much was there was a little jealousy, not only over the announcement of his dick size,  but there is still a piece of paper that says Matt taped to the wall under the O.P. and Anthony logo.  So it is officially the O.P., Anthony, and Matt Show.  So if you didn't hear today's show, I don't know if you want to.  What's that?  Oh, Sal. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, wow.  Sal, the intern, just ran back in here and ripped down the Matt sign off the wall.  Because the other interns can't stand the kid.  He's sashaying up the hall right now, not realizing that Sal just humiliated him again.  Speaking of dicks, when Matt needs to wrap that thing up, I'm sure he uses Trojan bearskin condoms because they feel so good.  Trojan is America's number one most trusted condom brand, no matter what you're working with.  I mean, if you're working with something the size of Matt's piece, you can still work with Trojan. 
[03:38:00]  They're there to be trusted, and Matt is not.  He was brought in here.  I mean, it turned out, and I don't know if I'm selling you on the replay or making sure that you do not listen all afternoon,  because he came in, I guess, to talk about Occupy Wall Street,  and that segment turned into almost two hours without a commercial break.  It started with the topic of Occupy Wall Street.  Stump Brain was on the phone. 
[03:38:30]  If you remember, Stump Brain, we don't have any good Stump Brain material, do we, Eric?  No.  He didn't even look.  What's your problem with Stump Brain?  Oh, I love Stump Brain, but every time he was on, it was all heavy political stuff.  There has to have been something that he did.  Let me look.  Yeah, look up Stump Brain or something, because Stump Brain, when we were on K-Rock,  for whatever reason, K-Rock as a station, decided that our staff wasn't cutting it,  and they needed their own executive producer. 
[03:39:00]  I'm not taking that as a shot against me or Eric or Danny or whatever,  but they decided that our executive producer needed some assistance for the K-Rock side, which, sure.  So Stump Brain got hired to come on and be the executive producer for the K-Rock side of the Opie and Anthony show.  He now works for TheBlaze.com, which is like a political website.  He was always very heavy into politics, and to me, the thing that I found just awesome was that when he was getting hired at The Blaze, 
[03:39:30]  somebody called me, Sam Roberts, of all people, to say, his real name is Michael Pelka, Stump Brain.  What can you tell us about Mike?  And I was like, wait, I realize.  You were a reference for him?  It was a job reference, and they were calling me.  I've taken job references for a lot of interns.  They came to me and said, Paul, who you hear on the air right now, Paul does some stuff with us part-time.  He used to intern for us, and they said, what do you think of his work ethic and stuff? 
[03:40:00]  I said, sucks.  But they didn't listen to me.  Of course you did.  They didn't listen to me for Paul, but I did give Stump Brain a shining recommendation for The Blaze,  and it's amazing that of all the people that have come and gone, it's Stump Brain that has, like, well, and Garrett, too.  Stump Brain and Garrett are the guys that have gone through this natural disaster that is the Opie and Anthony show  and come out and still been on speaking terms with the show in general.  Like, Stump Brain can still call up and have a nice phone, a nice call-in. 
[03:40:30]  I also don't know why is it that Stump Brain doesn't get ritualistically abused when he calls up.  I mean, everybody else, people are already calling into the after show with suggestions.  Trucker Ed, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Sam, please, no more, Matt.  I'll blow Norton when he comes to the...  I'll put red lipstick on.  No more, Matt.  You're killing me. 
[03:41:00]  Really, you guys are.  You're fucking killing me.  See, it's amazing because people were Twittering in saying, is Matt the new Bobo?  Because everybody hates Bobo on the air.  But the thing about Bobo was that in the beginning, everybody liked him.  And then he just completely wore out his welcome.  I've never seen anybody so hated across the board so quickly as intern Matt.  I mean, look, we've got to give him some credit for evoking emotion.  He had that one good appearance.  And that was it.  His first one, and then... 
[03:41:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  He said, no, no, no, at least Bobo lasted.  This guy, every time he gets on, my stomach turns.  It's like, no, please, no more.  You hate him.  I can't stand him.  Bring Chip.  Uncle Paul.  No Matt.  No fucking Matt.  So you like everybody on the show except...  Matt.  Except Matt, okay.  And his big dick in his backpack.  That's it.  Thank you, Trucker Ed.  Thank you, Trucker Ed.  Yeah.  And Sean wanted to chime in on the same topic. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, this stupid fuck.  What part of him does he not fucking understand?  He fucking travels the goddamn world and thinks he's not fucking privileged?  Hey, wait a second.  I traveled the fucking world too, but I did it for a fucking reason.  I was trained to fucking kill people.  Like that story.  Fuck.  Oh my God.  And now he's protesting the government, Sean.  Thank you.  Oh God.  I'll put it to you this way.  Thursday, I was up in Philadelphia. 
[03:42:30]  Them stupid fucking occupied...  I drive a truck for a living.  I had a stupid bitch trying to sell me a t-shirt.  She ran out in front of my fucking truck and stopped.  She's fucking retarded.  Thank you, Sean.  People are so, so upset.  Matt, I can't...  And now people are calling.  I can't go to your phone calls all day because I guess Matt is just really upset.  Eric, is Matt the one screening the calls?  Yes, he is.  All right.  So why don't you guys just call up and talk to the screener then? 
[03:43:00]  There you go.  If you really want to.  I mean...  And I'll pop the mic on if he gets out of hand.  Okay.  Because, yeah, Stump Brain was on the phone.  Because Stump Brain, his whole thing is politics.  Like, the reason he's called Stump Brain, as corny of a name as it is, was because he's  the spare brain.  Because he's smart.  Yeah.  I guess it's just that he just branded himself that way.  But he is...  Is...  Oh, no.  I got...  Bill from Philly is saying that Bert Kersher is trying to come by the after show.  I told him he was welcome to come by. 
[03:43:30]  I know he's in town.  Bert the Conqueror.  He's been on the show before.  I know he's in town filming.  He was doing something with Rachel Ray.  Right.  And so he said he didn't know if he was going to make it to the show in time.  But if he was going to get to the after show, he would try to.  I told him he's welcome.  He knows.  He sent some nice shirts over, though.  I know.  I can't believe how soft these shirts are.  The machine.  Yeah.  The machine shirts.  You remember when Bert was on.  Yeah.  If he's around, he's welcome to stop by.  I don't know if he's very busy while he's here.  Hopefully, he can stop by because we love him on the show.  But, yeah. 
[03:44:00]  And Matt is sitting here arguing while Stump Brain is saying, no, Matt, you're wrong.  He's saying, here's what it is.  Here's the research.  You can read the article on this website.  Matt's going, no, no.  Well, why don't you go to the other website?  And they're like.  He never really had an answer for what that website was at all.  No.  He never knew.  I was sitting right by a computer like, Matt, just tell me the website.  Oh, no, no.  Just Google it.  Yeah, that's the one.  Yeah.  And they're all just like, you know, super hardcore, anarchist, liberal, green living blogs that some guy just writes out of nowhere. 
[03:44:30]  Like, they said – like, his thing was that, I guess, Chase Bank contributed money to the Wall Street protest, which to Matt – intern Matt was saying means that they knew in advance – no, not – I'm sorry.  Blech.  I'm all over the place.  Chase Bank contributed money to the NYPD before March on Wall Street.  Does Matt understand that when the NYPD is given any type of donation whatsoever, it all goes into a general fund that is used throughout the entire – 
[03:45:00]  Of course he doesn't understand that.  But Matt said that, you know, Chase donating money to the NYPD before the March on Wall Street was evidence that they knew – they could have known ahead of time that this was coming, the March on Wall – I mean, you know, the Occupy Wall Street.  And Stump Brain said, just go to Chase's website.  It says right there that they – yes, they donated money, but it was a year ago.  And then first Matt said, well, maybe their official website is lying.  And it's like, yeah, that's true.  Maybe they lie on their official website. 
[03:45:30]  It's a fair point.  But how could you take the word of some random blogger versus the official statement?  Like, it's probably more likely that random blogger is making things up or just misinformed.  Something tells me that random blogger isn't an investigative reporter.  Yeah, they're probably very much like Matt, except without the big dick.  You know what I mean?  But – and then he said, well, maybe they knew a year in advance.  So it's like he can't –  Yeah, that really – that got me mad.  I'm like, that's that bullshit conspiracy shit.  You can't just let go. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, we planned it a year ago.  Like, how could –  It's going to happen.  How could you give people that much credit that people are smart enough to get something like this done a year in advance?  It doesn't – it's impossible.  And this is what I was telling Matt because Matt complains to me off the air saying that when they bring up stuff like this, I don't put his name in front of Opie and Anthony enough.  I say things like – like I'll type Opie a message that says Matt's got a stupid conspiracy theory about this.  And Opie will look at it and then he won't mention it because he doesn't want Matt on the air.  And then Matt goes, well, why – 
[03:46:30]  Because it sucks.  Yeah.  Why did you have to say stupid?  And I said because first of all, it is a stupid conspiracy theory and second of all, because when you come on the air, everybody has to fall into the intern Matt zone and lots of times people don't want to do it.  And that's why that is.  And he just argues and argues and he won't let go.  Like he won't just say, oh, okay, maybe you're right.  Like that's not in his vocabulary.  Okay, maybe you're right.  And that's what drives people insane.  Like he won't just let it go. 
[03:47:00]  He can't even concede a point when it's staring him in the face.  No.  And I did.  Opie mentioned on the air today.  I went down to Occupy Wall Street with – and by the way, I'm just reading feedback.  I just glanced over at it.  Bobo should be happy because Matt is gaining Bobo fans.  Like people are saying that after hearing Matt on the air –  They want Bobo back.  I would much rather have that time replaced with Bobo just playing with his dick or whatever he does.  I think that's out of default though.  If you pit the two against each other, people are just going to say Bobo. 
[03:47:30]  Look, if you put – Bobo, I think, before Matt, was the worst person to ever be on the show.  Now Matt is.  So it makes Bobo look better.  He's no longer the worst person to ever be on the show.  So congratulations to Bobo.  But I was down at Occupy Wall Street, as Opie mentioned.  I went down and met him there on Friday while he was filming after work.  And it's – Opie's 100% right.  Like it's not going to end peacefully.  And I didn't see it before, so I don't know if there are more people or less people now. 
[03:48:00]  But like people are just walking around.  People are on top of each other down there because you should go down if you're in the area.  What's it called?  What's the name of the park, Eric?  Zuccotti?  Zuccotti?  Zuccotti Park, yeah.  Go down to Zuccotti Park because it's not a big park.  It's not like it's Central Park.  It's tiny.  Like it takes three minutes to walk around the entire park.  It's less than a city block.  It's nothing.  It's a very small park.  And it is full of protesters and tents. 
[03:48:30]  And you're getting to the point – like Opie's videos make the area look like it's a lot bigger than it actually is.  Like when I was down there, you're getting to the point where the tents are on top of each other.  You're pushing.  If you actually go into the protest, if you go into the park as opposed to just walking around it, you have to push and you're fighting through people.  Everybody has been there for weeks and it's cold.  So people are irritable now.  And no one smells good.  No one smells good.  Although you do get the aroma of some weed walking around. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, yes.  I'm surprised.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  That's definitely still there.  But like people are irritable.  And you can hear it just the way people are now kind of like just like snapping.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, I'll get it done.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's not done yet.  Or like, you know, somebody's doing an interview and the person behind them is yelling.  You're stepping on the tent.  That's my tent.  You're stepping on my tent.  And it's like, well, there's no room.  They sound like intern David.  Yeah, exactly.  Everybody is just completely at their wits end with this whole thing. 
[03:49:30]  But they can't leave.  And there is no, this is what we want.  So there's no.  Yeah, that's all gone.  There's no end goal.  So what are we left with?  Violence.  That's what we're left with.  Well, I was actually hanging out with a NYPD cop yesterday.  And he's been down there.  And they're all loving the overtime.  But they're literally, he said, they're waiting for somebody to kill somebody else.  The way it's looking, that's what's going to happen.  It's not like, the way it has been perceived or portrayed, I should say, has been sort of like peaceful protesting. 
[03:50:00]  It's just, you know, we're just here trying to get our point of view across.  If you go down there, like, it's not safe.  I wouldn't sleep there.  It's not.  That's exactly what he said, too.  It's not safe.  Does, Eric, don't, ask Matt if he thinks it's still safe to sleep there.  Matt, is it safe to sleep there?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  No, it's not.  He's wrong.  It's, I mean, there's just, there's too many people.  And they're not all protesters.  There's a lot of homeless people down there.  There's a lot of crazy people down there.  I wouldn't sleep there just because I don't want to see someone like Matt crawling up next 
[03:50:30]  to me.  And he would, too.  He's fingered strangers down there.  And I got a long hair.  Yeah, you're right, Eric.  He looks like Dr. Teeth, the Muppet.  Except, yeah, except Dr. Teeth didn't have so much plaque on his teeth.  Oh.  Sorry, man.  He hasn't been able to shower.  Yeah, that's right.  He can't brush his teeth.  Yeah.  He does smell terrible today, by the way.  What's James in Kansas saying?  James, you're on the after show.  He has got to be the dumbest motherfucker on the face of the earth.  Who?  I call Matt.  I call and I say, Matt, Sam's a dumb motherfucker. 
[03:51:00]  Let me talk to him.  And he actually put me on the air thinking I was on a side point.  What do you think of Matt?  I want him dead.  I actually want to drop my load, not in his mouth or anything, or on his clit, and then  fucking run up to New York and kill him.  He's got to be the dumbest motherfucker.  Anyway, that's all I really got.  I came in toward the end when he was talking about how he didn't know what a clit was. 
[03:51:30]  I just totally fucking confused me.  I mean, it was technically two segments of Matt today, because you missed all the Wall  Street stuff, and then we got into the clit stuff, and then Matt just decided to proclaim  to everybody that he had a really big dick.  Sure, and so does my mother.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, James.  Do you want to hear it again?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Let's just bring everybody aboard.  Okay, hang on.  I have a really big dick, so I'm a very good friend. 
[03:52:00]  Are you really packing?  Yeah.  How would he pack him?  About seven.  What are you talking about?  Seven is not a big dick.  It's like, it's above average.  Yeah.  I guess.  But it's not like, what is that?  Like, a really big dick is supposed to be like, oh my god, I've never seen anything like that  before in my life.  Yeah.  Like, you belong in Ripley's Believe It or Not.  You should be, you're some kind of freak.  You're a genetic freak.  Look at that thing hanging off your torso.  Not, oh yeah, I guess that's a little bigger than my ex. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  That's not, you know, that's not really big.  If the pants don't come down and you hear, oh wow, you're not packing, like, a gigantic  penis.  And that's not, you know, stupid, idiot Matt's cue to say, well, I bet it's bigger than,  nobody is having a penis contest with you, intern Matt.  Eric, how come you didn't have the balls to ask, because intern Matt's Twitter is just  intern Matt, I guess.  How come you didn't have the balls to go on the, how come you said it in my ear instead  of going on the air and asking if Matt was going to change his Twitter after he doesn't 
[03:53:00]  get invited back next semester?  Well, because Matt and Jim were having a side conversation with their phone sex, and then  Ope and you were having another conversation, so I didn't want to throw another voice in  there.  There were a lot of conversations going on.  There is, by the way, are there any Joe Frazier songs that we didn't play on the show?  Um, yeah.  Okay.  Give me a second.  Yeah, yeah, you have a second, because there are a bunch of conversations going on, and there's  one that I wanted to have.  It's about Argentium.  Yes!  Argentium!  Everybody's asking, what is Argentium?  It's Steven Singer's... 
[03:53:30]  Sam, what is Argentium?  I was just about to tell you, Eric.  I'm glad you asked, though, because Argentium is Steven Singer's super silver collection.  It's brand new silvers.  It's brighter than platinum, white gold, and sterling silver.  Low maintenance...  No, maintenance.  Low maintenance.  These are hard words to say.  Tarnish resistant.  It's made using only recycled silver.  Real silverware.  That's right.  So you're going to make your chick wet, first of all, because she's going to be so excited 
[03:54:00]  about this silver.  And then, when you tell her that you also did your part to save the world, she'll give you  anything you want.  Wow.  It's all available at 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER, I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.com, or in person on the  other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia.  Not that corner.  The other corner.  And I know, because that's what I like to do.  You know, I browse on the website.  Sometimes I call 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER just to chat.  But when I'm doing my jewelry shopping, I like to go all the way to Philly.  It's worth the trip. 
[03:54:30]  Go down there, because you get your cookies, you get your drinks.  My man, Turbo Joe, he works there.  And Steven Singer's there, too.  But Turbo Joe hooks it up.  He made me a diamond expert when I needed to become one, when I was shopping for engagement  rings.  And he...  That's the thing about it.  He will make you not only feel like he's an expert, but he will share his expertise  with you.  So you can go home and give your chick whatever jewelry you've gotten her, and then explain  to her as if you have any idea what you're talking about.  It's all at Steven Singer again. 
[03:55:00]  He also gave you fresh baked cookies.  Yeah, I mean, they were delicious.  I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.com, 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.  Or do it the old-fashioned way.  Do it the Sam Roberts way.  Do it in person.  On the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia, at I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER, and the people of Philadelphia  reeling over the sickness of smoking Joe Frazier.  Eric, we had him on the show June 2009.  He was awesome on the air. 
[03:55:30]  I mean, I would say hopefully we'll get him back, but we talked about it on the show.  It's not happening.  Hospice is usually the last stop on the road, but he was amazing on the show.  He stayed, how long did he stay, for an hour and a half?  That bit was, he probably stayed longer, but that bit I have here is over 50 minutes.  Yeah, I think all told, yeah, because you weren't here that day, he stayed like an hour  and a half, and first, you know, we were talking to him the way we would talk to any boxer,  talking about his past, his fights with Ali, where he's at today, how he's feeling, blah, 
[03:56:00]  blah, blah.  But, I mean, he was just such an insane person that he ended up singing.  Yeah, right in the middle of a conversation.  As the interview went on, like, instead of, he's saying, all right, you know, we've been  here for over an hour, I'm kind of bored, I'm going to get out of here, he would just  start humming little ditties.  He thought himself quite the songsman.  And so, in honor of Joe Frazier, he's sick.  We have a bunch. 
[03:56:30]  What do we have?  Let me, I'm going to pick a good one.  All right, hang on.  We have Six Days on the Road.  We have Who's Making Love to Your Old Lady.  When a Man Loves a Woman, Mustang Sally, and Ate No Sense and Going Home.  I got to say that I feel like I speak for the people, the listeners of After Opie and  Anthony Live, and I think that we all want to hear When a Man Loves a Woman.  That's the old classic.  That's the one everybody knows. 
[03:57:00]  So, here it is, Joe Frazier, live on the Opie and Anthony show, singing When a Man Loves  a Woman.  When a man loves a woman.  Can't keep his mind on nothing else.  That's all I know is that one point.  Oh, damn it.  I only know When a Man Loves a Woman.  How about I could just sing, like, the one line with you?  I could sing the name of the song.  And that's it.  What's the name of the song?  When a Man Loves a Woman.  Okay.  That's what it is.  Did we ever do a Smoke and Joe Sings the Hits bit? 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, we did a Joe Frazier karaoke camp.  Let's play it.  All right, hang on.  Let me get that.  Yeah, Joe Frazier.  He's sick.  While I'm getting that, you want to hear another song?  No, no, no.  Because I don't want to spoil the bit.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm kind of bummed that he's sick because...  Okay, I got it.  Plus, I mean, let me tell you, the guy is 67.  He looks much worse.  Like, he looks...  When Opie said 67 today on the air, I was like, no way.  And I looked it up and he is 67. 
[03:58:00]  And he doesn't...  He's taken his time in the ring, uh, difficultly.  Here it is.  Joe Frazier karaoke camp.  You might think you can sing, but you're wrong.  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp.  Call me a smoke wave.  And learn to sing like a champ.  Who's making love with my old lady while I'm out making love?  Joe doesn't just teach you to sing the classics.  He beats the awful right out of you. 
[03:58:30]  When a man loves a woman...  Words is the most important thing to, let's say, songs.  Because sometimes, you know, you...  After a few short weeks with Joe's unique approach to vocal training,  you'll be belting out tunes just like Smoke and Joe belted Muhammad Ali.  Ooh!  Or you'll have brain damage.  Ah!  Spend two amazing weeks in Joe Frazier's 700-square-foot apartment  above his Philadelphia boxing gym.  And floor your friends with your amazing vocal chops.  Joe might have high blood pressure, diabetes, and needs to carry a cane to stand upright, 
[03:59:00]  but his magical voice will bring you to tears.  Mustang selling now, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Think you better slow than Mustang down.  Ow!  And if that doesn't, his left hook will.  You'll be hitting the high notes faster than Joe Frazier hits the canvas.  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp, where our motto is...  Me, you ain't used these as you better.  Hey, dawg.  When you got a song in your heart, that's all that counts, isn't it? 
[03:59:30]  Smoke and Joe Frazier, everybody.  Smoke and Joe Frazier.  I'm just sad that that recording career never panned out the way he thought it would.  I was remembering, though, while that was playing, that that was when he was in,  was when I was still doing the O&A backstage, or whatever those bits were called.  Yeah.  And I used to kind of interview all the guests as they were leaving.  I still do that every now and then, I guess, for this show,  but only with, like, the big, like, Larry King-type guests.  By the way, somebody may be coming back here soon.  Really?  Never mind.  Joe Frazier? 
[04:00:00]  Probably not Joe Frazier.  I was more alluding to Larry King, but that's neither here nor there.  I remember I was doing...  I had to do the interview with Joe Frazier, so I cleared it with his people and everything,  and he said, all right, I'm just going to go to the bathroom.  So Joe Frazier was right outside the studio, and he goes...  I go, where are you going?  To the bathroom?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, I'll follow you.  And Joe stopped and looked at me like, what?  I went, no, no, not into the bathroom.  Oh, okay, okay.  He thought I meant I was going to go into the stall with him and conduct an interview. 
[04:00:30]  It simply meant walking down the hall, but...  Wasn't he living, like, above a gym?  His gym, I think.  His gym, right?  Actually, there's a great documentary, Thrilla in Manila.  I have it.  I have a Netflix.  I haven't checked it.  It's really good.  It's the one with, like, the cover's white and has Ollie and Frazier on the cover.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's really good.  I got the DVD somewhere, but it's...  I don't even like boxing all that much, but...  And the documentary is amazing, like...  I gotta check it out.  You should find that backstage, because I'm not seeing it in here.  Oh, really? 
[04:01:00]  If you still have it...  I wonder if I...  You should get that ready in case the inevitable happens.  I don't think there is...  I don't think you could say in case the inevitable happens.  If it's inevitable, it is going to happen.  Trying to soften it.  That's what makes it inevitable.  People are...  I can't move...  Paul.  Well...  Yeah.  You have to have sympathy for me here, because I can't move on to other topics.  Listen...  Snowy in Michigan.  You're on the After Open Anthony Live program.  Hey, how you guys doing?  What's up?  The Rocky rule, first off.  We'll get that off my chest. 
[04:01:30]  Thank you, sir.  I hate to re-preface this by saying, I'm not a big fan of Matt, neither.  The guy has a horrendous representation of the 99%, taking out a loan, traveling around  the world, putting his...  He's a 1%.  There he is.  ...trying to act like he's 1%.  However, I think some of the hatred you have for him, Sam, might be a little jealousy,  because you kind of shoehorn yourself as much as you can on the air doing other shows, and  Matt's kind of doing the same thing, isn't he?  No, I would be jealous of Matt if he was... 
[04:02:00]  You have a big dick?  Well, I've heard he does have a big dick.  I am jealous of that.  You have a big dick.  I'll be jealous of him.  I would be jealous of Matt if he were coming on the air and getting positive attention.  Like, if all of his...  Like, maybe if all of his appearances were like his first appearance, then I would be jealous.  But, I mean, I don't need to come on the air and have people call up the after show  just to tell everybody how much they want me dead.  Like, I'm not jealous.  Like I said, though, like I said, I'm just saying, I'm not a big fan of the guy neither, 
[04:02:30]  and I think he's a bit, you know, this whole, you know, I'm well known, I'm representing  99%, but I'm going around the world, traveling, spreading my big dick all over the place, trying  to be the 1%.  Yeah.  But, I mean, the guy's a horrible representation of the 99%.  I mean...  He really is.  I don't think a little bit...  I still think a little bit of your anger with him, besides being an incompetent person  around the studio there, apparently, like you guys say he is.  He is incompetent.  Maybe a little bit, because he's trying to shoehorn himself like you do.  Well, I mean, I don't know if jealousy... 
[04:03:00]  I mean, maybe I'm annoyed, because I see...  I've seen him, uh...  Maybe you see a little bit of him in you, huh?  No, no, I see...  I see his...  His speech patterns, and the things that he does, like he tries to do the things that  I've done.  He weasels his way in, is the word you're looking for, I think.  Yeah, but, like, he's specifically, like, copying things that I've done.  It's not like I'm like, oh, that's what I would have done.  Like, he's literally saying things and doing things that I did.  So, I mean, I...  You know, I'm not jealous of that.  It's annoying, because I'm like, it's not gonna work a second time. 
[04:03:30]  I already did it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, thanks, Snowy.  All right, good luck, man.  All right.  Also, I don't think the listeners understand that he's just annoying to work around.  I also like that, uh, uh, the caller, Snowy or Snow, I don't remember, he goes, um, listen,  I want to say, Sam, I think you're jealous of Matt.  No, no, no, before you answer, please keep in mind, I absolutely hate Matt.  I don't want to give him any credit whatsoever.  So, even when there's something, um, Club Store to Kenny's texting me and saying that Matt  said his dick was about seven inches, which means he's rounding up. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, of course.  So, you're looking at six and a quarter, maybe?  You think it's that, like, he's rounding up three quarters of an inch.  I think it's five and three quarters, and he's just kind of, you know, overdoing it,  just to be sure, but.  Kenny is also, uh, texting me that he is stuck in tunnel traffic.  Oh.  Yeah, I got that, too.  I love the Kenny updates.  Yeah, stuck in tunnel traffic.  I wish he would share that with the listeners, though.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook?  Yeah, I guess that's what it is.  I would go to, uh, intern Matt on Twitter today, though.  I think that's the account of the day.  Um, what else, what else, what else? 
[04:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Do we have time to play any Andy Rooney stuff?  Because that's the other, I mean, Joe Frazier and Andy Rooney today.  Joe Frazier's not dead.  Somebody, Pip on the phone is saying he's dead.  We're going to a lot of phone calls today.  Pip, I don't think Joe Frazier's dead.  No, he's not.  All right.  Hang on.  Yeah, I checked, I saw that call come in.  I checked all the feed.  It would have been everywhere by now, and it's not.  Some person on feedback says they're going to make IHateInternMet.com.  Ooh.  Which, you know, feel free.  Hold on, I'm looking.  Yeah, do we have any quick Andy Rooney stuff? 
[04:05:00]  Um, I have a bunch of those produced ones that we did.  Yeah.  If you want any of those.  Yeah, let's play one of them.  We, uh...  Andy's thoughts on watches, shoes, his life, vacations, or his celebrity juicer commercial.  I really like the watches one for some reason.  I remember, I think we were on KROQ when I pulled that, and, uh, I really liked the way it was covered and, uh, what ONA did with it.  So I think I'm going to go with watches.  We lost Andy Rooney over the weekend, and when I say lost, I mean, we are still the same people we were.  We didn't really lose much. 
[04:05:30]  He was 92 years old and decades past his prime.  But, nevertheless, Andy Rooney is as dead as a doornail, uh, never been deader, couldn't be less alive.  So, we're going to play the Andy Rooney bit, and, uh, that's about it.  Andy Rooney and watches on After Oak and Anthony Live.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's performance of My Thoughts on Life with Andy Rooney.  Regrettably, Mr. Rooney has fallen ill, and his part will be performed by renowned thespian James Norton. 
[04:06:00]  Without further ado, Andy Rooney.  I'm Andy Rooney.  I like watches.  I talk a lot about watches.  When the big hand's on the 12, I've just shit my pants.  And when the big hand's on the 4, I've just pissed on myself and grabbed my wife's breast.  Do you ever notice when someone turns around in bed like Oscar Madison?  You put your penis in the wrong hole? 
[04:06:30]  Do you ever notice that?  Do you ever notice?  You've never seen me walking?  My asshole has actually been stuck to this seat since 1973.  Do you ever notice that?  This concludes tonight's performance of My Thoughts on Life with Andy Rooney starring James Norton.  So, yes, Andy Rooney dead.  And let me tell you something, Rooney.  If you think...  Rooney!  Rooney!  If you think being dead is going to stop you from being mocked, you're 100% wrong, my friend.  Don't think that you could take the easy way out of this. 
[04:07:00]  Don't think you can just go and croak and because of that, the Opie and Anthony show is going to take it easy on you.  You have a lifetime of work, my friend.  You stayed on TV very late into your life and that has given us quite a bit of material to mock you for for quite some time.  And we'll do, just like when any other character that someone on the show impersonates dies, we just do the ghost.  Oh, yes.  Yes. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, my God.  This is great.  The ghost of Andy Rooney coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  So, um, and we just have to remind them because before it was like they would do, Jim would do the Andy Rooney impression if Andy Rooney had been talking about something specifically ridiculous on television.  Yeah.  Now, the ghost music would just come on and it'll be, you know, anything.  You ever wondered, you know, something about angels and halos and wings and...  Life in hell.  Hell, yeah. 
[04:08:00]  What am I talking about?  What the hell does he know about angels and halos and wings?  Have you ever noticed that Satan keeps poking me in the ass with this pitchfork, goddammit?  You ever noticed when that one thing you wanted is within grasp but it stays there for all eternity and you can't reach it?  I have one but it's going to fall real bad.  Yeah, I thought about it too and I was like...  This is what it is.  This is the after show, okay?  Do you think mine were great?  No.  You just do.  Eric, what was yours?  Let Paul go first.  Did you ever notice when you push that rock all the way up the hill it just rolls right back down to the bottom? 
[04:08:30]  And you just got to push it up again.  Just again, yeah.  Eric, you ever notice no one laughs when you say it's hot as hell in here?  You see, this is a safe place, okay?  You can't go on the Opie and Anthony show and make those types of jokes.  I can't make my types of jokes because we'll get thrown out of the place.  But I want the after show to be a safe place.  A place where dead Andy Rooney can always come and hang out no matter how bad his jokes are.  I mean, he's in hell for God's sake.  It is hot.  And why would anybody say hot as hell while they're in hell? 
[04:09:00]  I wish I could say that.  I'm Andy Rooney in hell.  Oh, you have another impression.  That's right.  We don't even have time to get into Sandberg today, do we?  Ah, you have two and a half minutes.  You can squeeze that in there.  That guy just rips you off left and right.  You noticed it too?  Everybody did.  That's what I thought.  Look, I have the disc.  I don't have time to play the whole thing.  We'll get to it tomorrow.  I want to get it, but do you have the thing that I asked you for earlier today? 
[04:09:30]  Yeah, hang on, hang on.  No, you don't have to play it now.  I just wanted to see if you have it for tomorrow.  Yeah, I have it for tomorrow.  Somebody who already ripped off my one-question interviews has now decided to rip off my Chris  Humphreys impression.  Really?  That was the first one you've ever done.  I debuted the Chris Humphreys impression last week, and it's already been ripped off by that  same goddamn not-quite-ready-for-primetime player.  Mr. I-can't-get-people-to-buy-movie-tickets-himself, Andy Samberg. 
[04:10:00]  I heard a couple years ago he was walking around saying, what's the haps?  I bet he was.  But I thought he was real funny, too.  Real original, Samberg!  Speaking of what's the haps, you know how TBS reruns Family Guy a million hours a day?  The episode where Stewie was taking steroids?  He walks right out there and goes, hey, Brian, what's the haps?  I'm still pissed that Eazy-E took it from me, or Ice Cube took it from me on that NWA song.  22 years ago.  I know, it's ridiculous.  You're on After Open Anthony Live. 
[04:10:30]  I got through the tunnel.  Oh, thank God.  I know people were worried and wondering.  It's always important that we have a conclusion to these ongoing storylines, Club Soda Kenny.  I know, and my friend Rocco is listening, and he texted me that he hates Matt also.  Okay, that's good to know.  I was getting texts from the ECW Zombie.  I was getting texts from the Stangle Brothers at Letterman.  Everybody hates intern Matt.  It's amazing.  It's because he sucks.  Thank you, Kenny.  We've got to wrap up the show. 
[04:11:00]  All right.  Have a nice day.  Thanks.  Yes, we do.  This show, by the way, was brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  Later on today, Paul, I teased it a little bit on Friday, but you've all forgotten because  nobody pays attention to this show.  Your big announcement?  I will be on Martha Stewart Living Channel.  Really?  They said I couldn't get on every channel.  Is that today?  I'm working on it.  It's today, I think, at 5 p.m. 
[04:11:30]  You should have your own plug ready.  Yeah, I think I'm going on whatever with Jennifer Hutt.  She was in here a week or two ago.  She invited me to be on the show.  Do you think?  Do you think names, too?  No, I don't think so.  Yeah, I was going to say, do you think your appearance is going to be different from her  appearance on this show?  I'm hoping, yeah, I'm going to go in there and just be destroyed and my Facebook's going  to be attacked by the nine people that listen to Martha Stewart Living.  Yes, it'll be on, but let's make it more than nine today, folks, huh?  And then maybe keep listening to her.  It's on channel 110 at 5 p.m. on the East. 
[04:12:00]  I'll be on whatever with Jennifer Hutt, I think.  I'm almost positive, but take it as positive.  It's a plug, so just listen at 5 p.m. Eastern.  That's it.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live tomorrow, and  intern Matt won't be on the air.  See you later.  The Opie and Anthony Show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A Show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony Live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern. 
[04:12:30]  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey! </pre>
