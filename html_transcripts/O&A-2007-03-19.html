<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens chaotically, with unexplained shouts hinting at a strong smell or other disturbance.  The hosts then transition to discussing their successful party at FH Riley's, Anthony's brother's bar, praising the well-behaved listeners in attendance.  The show moves to listener calls; one Pittsburgh caller threatens to return to Howard Stern, while another suggests various segments, including "waking up" different groups (alcoholics, overweight people, "suicide girls").  A discussion about the definition of "emo" quickly devolves into crude and offensive speculation.  Another caller mentions the website "Gimps Gone Wild," prompting shocked but amused reactions from the hosts as they describe the content.

A large portion of the show focuses on Anthony's ongoing divorce proceedings, seven years after the fact. He details his ex-wife's lawsuit, alleging inaccuracies in his reported income and contributions to the marriage. He recounts his frustration with the legal process and her allegedly false statements, including a bizarre anecdote about her proposing a three-way sexual encounter three years into their marriage.  He announces an upcoming court date on April 12th (possibly at 60 Centre Street, NYC) and invites listeners to attend.  The hosts speculate that the initial critical caller might be connected to a Pittsburgh radio personality known as "Baghdad Bob."  Further listener calls discuss Anthony's legal troubles.

The discussion continues with Anthony’s ongoing legal battle, highlighting the frustrations and absurdities of divorce.  Anthony reveals his ex-wife never learned to drive, a fact that amuses the hosts.  A caller promotes Jimmy Norton's comedy shows, which is deemed poorly timed given Anthony's stressful situation.  Anthony confesses to forgetting his own wedding anniversary, mistaking it for Swallows Day in San Juan Capistrano. The conversation turns increasingly vulgar and angry, with Anthony using derogatory terms to describe his ex-wife.

A "MacBook Karaoke" segment follows, judged by Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton.  Callers perform karaoke for a chance to win a MacBook, with much disagreement and humorous commentary on their vocal abilities. Ariana's significantly off-key rendition of "I Will Always Love You" is particularly memorable. Christina from Philadelphia ultimately wins.  Master Poe then performs Prince's "When Doves Cry" in studio. The show concludes with the "F-U Line," featuring angry and vulgar messages, and a guest appearance by Chris Hansen of "To Catch a Predator."

Chris Hansen discusses his experiences on *To Catch a Predator*, his new book, and the techniques used in his investigations, including anecdotes from Cambodia, India, and Africa. He details methods of eliciting confessions and discusses the psychological profiles of male and female predators.  A caller recounts encountering a television producer suspect.  The conversation touches on internet scams, online predators, and the aftermath of Hansen's show.  A discussion about a karaoke contestant with a large bust size and the perceived sex appeal of different bra sizes ensues, along with a discussion of films *In the Company of Men* and *Bill* and one host's ongoing argument with his girlfriend.


The show begins with a humorous anecdote about one host's wife and a sex toy.  This leads into a bizarre German news story about an incestuous brother-sister couple with four children fighting for legal recognition.  The hosts and a caller engage in graphic and explicit discussions of incestuous sexual acts, along with the genetic implications and impact on the children.  Izzy, a caller, shares a funny story about a midget struggling with a snow shovel.  The conversation then shifts to Donald Trump's criticism of George W. Bush and the Iraq War, with varied opinions on Trump's motivations and the political climate. The hosts offer their views on the war, Saudi Arabia's role, and anti-war protests.  A significant portion focuses on a video from obinancy.com ("Money Snatch Stalker Patty Crawls Naked For Money"), featuring a naked woman collecting money while interacting with fake semen and rubber balls.  Callers react to the video and the show's content.  Further discussion of the Iraq War and its consequences ensues, alongside personal anecdotes and opinions from callers.  The segment concludes with a caller impersonating Taylor Hicks from American Idol and a discussion of his music.

The final segment opens with a nonsensical discussion of American Idol, followed by a discussion of Yakuza pinky finger amputation rituals and police infiltration tactics.  Bodogfight.com is mentioned as a sponsor before the "Line of the Day" segment, featuring a graphically sexual and incestuous joke.  The show then abruptly announces an early end unless a female caller agrees to defecate in a bag and throw it at a window.  A long wait ensues, filled with increasingly bizarre and sexually suggestive comments, but no such caller appears.  The show ends with Prince's "When Doves Cry" and a short clip of their positive mention on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  As daylight breaks, creeping through the shadow, an unstoppable force lays in wait, ready to strike.  Oh my God!  Oh Jesus, Jimmy!  I get scared.  I get scared.  Oh, God! 
[00:00:30]  Holy mother of God!  Oh boy, please don't.  God damn it.  What?  What?  Oh, it stinks so bad.  Oh my God.  This is killing me.  You're killing me.  Uh-oh.  Just fart so we can start the bit.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  Oh my God! 
[00:01:00]  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  I'm stung because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at this face.  How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel.  Oh!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Danger, danger.  What you're about to hear is just not right.  Stupid dramatic music.  Very dramatic.  Hi.  Hello.  Hello. 
[00:02:00]  Very things.  Another weekend.  Much too short.  Yeah.  Well, we had a nice party out there in Huntington, huh?  That's why it was too short.  Went out and partied like Saturday night.  And then you're just kind of unconscious on Sunday.  And then before you know it, it's Monday, four o'clock in the morning and time to get up.  Yeah.  Some weekends you could really drag out for a long time to just stay up. 
[00:02:30]  You could just like sleep maybe three hours on Friday night, Saturday night, and then Sunday you stay up.  And it's like, wow, that was a long weekend.  But if you hang out on Saturday night and you have a good time and then you get home and Sunday you finally wake up, you look at the clock, and it's like two in the afternoon.  You're like, damn, I've got to go to bed soon to get up to do the morning show.  It's over.  You had half a weekend.  We really had a great time at FH Riley's.  My brother's joint out there in Huntington, Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue. 
[00:03:00]  The place was packed.  I own it too, but I'm like a silent partner.  But, yeah, I want to thank everyone that went out there.  It was great.  We had a lot of fun.  And our listeners, a lot of comments coming in about our listeners that we could pack out a joint like we did Saturday, drink our faces off, and there was not one problem.  Not one problem.  People were amazed by that.  Usually alcohol and a lot of people don't mix, but for some reason with our listeners, there's never a problem. 
[00:03:30]  Well, if one of our listeners tried to throw a punch, they'd be winded for about a half hour.  So it's not like these people.  It wasn't so much that it was packed out.  I think there were 25 people in the whole place, but you couldn't move.  It is a smaller place.  No, I mean we have bigger people.  Oh, yeah, well, okay, good point, good point, good point.  But, yeah, I want to thank everyone that made it to FH Riley's.  A lot of familiar faces and a lot of new faces. 
[00:04:00]  A lot of new faces, that's for sure.  It was kind of cool to talk to some of the new faces.  Yeah.  So thanks again.  It was a huge success, and we're getting closer to maybe putting French doors in.  Oh, the French doors.  I keep hearing about the French doors.  Very excited.  We've got to make a few more bucks.  A couple more bucks and you get those French doors.  Yeah, go there this week and have a meal, will you?  We want French doors.  Where are you putting them?  Near the big window there.  Oh.  So the whole front will be wide open.  Oh, I got you.  It won't look as much like a bar because my brother wants to be known as a restaurant. 
[00:04:30]  I mean, his food is just unbelievable.  Yeah.  The bar is kind of secondary.  Secondary, excuse me.  Anyway, enough of that.  But I just want to thank everyone that made it out there.  It was a lot of fun for everybody.  It was a fine St. Paddy's Day.  Hi.  No, a party.  No, I don't say.  Come on.  No.  My brother sang some crazy tune.  He might sing it this week over at XM.  There are so many curses in it.  Oh, I know.  He takes on all our enemies in a song. 
[00:05:00]  In song.  In song.  It's wonderful.  All right.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  And right off the bat, a lot of phone calls coming in.  Let's say hi to Jim in Pittsburgh.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, you know how you guys are doing that radio bit all week for the past month or whatever?  What, where we're taking other shows and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  100.7 in Pittsburgh. 
[00:05:30]  J.R., Kate, and Bubba.  They're absolutely terrible.  J.R., Kate, and Bubba?  J.R., Kate, and Bubba.  That's three people?  Yeah.  Total douchebags.  Total.  But it sounds like every other show we've made fun of in the last month.  Pretty much.  What makes them a little different that maybe we would pay attention to them this week?  Well, a couple weeks ago they had this thing on.  And it really, you know, when you guys go to commercial, I switch over because I hate the commercials.  They had a, it was really cold and they're having a big bet on, ooh, the forecasters are always wrong. 
[00:06:00]  So on Monday, if it's below 20 degrees, one of the idiots has to sit outside and broadcast until it gets about 20 degrees.  It's five below, it's five below, and he's all of a sudden sick.  He can't come in.  I was like, you're a bunch of douchebags.  Wait, the whole bit is to, if it drops below 20 degrees, you have to broadcast from outside?  And what does that do?  That gives you a lot of breaks where the guy's just like, oh, it's cold out here, ooh. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  It moves terribly, Stu.  I hate it.  I absolutely hate it.  All right, we'll take a look.  I don't know.  We were thinking of resting that bit this week, but maybe if this one is a good one, we'll go there.  Wait, is Bubba the crazy one?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you have to be.  If you want to make all the insane statements and all, it's just stupid.  Right.  And then the stupid hole has to be, oh, Bubba.  The hole has to try to keep Bubba in line. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, Bubba.  It's her job to keep him in check.  If I wasn't here, boy, let me tell you what would be happening.  I'm sure every Monday, oh, Bubba, did you stay out late and watch the big game?  You look a little hungover this morning, Bubba.  He's like very motherly probably.  Yeah, I was out.  What's it to you?  Well, you know, you got work in the morning.  Bubba, we're concerned about you. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, and does he do all the dumb stunts probably?  Oh, yeah.  Actually, I think Bubba's probably the sports guy, so he has that voice and he's always out.  Yeah, that's what it is, the grappling.  I like that Chris Farley in his voice.  I don't even know the show, and I bet you we can figure everyone's part out.  Oh, how is it?  Hold on a minute.  This guy better have been listening for longer than six minutes.  Frank.  Hi, Frank.  You guys suck. 
[00:08:00]  The show is terrible.  We just started.  Attaboy, Frank.  Yo, listen, guys.  Listen to me, man.  I switched over.  Listen, I switched over from Howard to you guys, right?  When, Frank, when?  Like, I don't know, maybe about five months ago.  Right?  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  Let me talk.  Check it out.  Check it out.  I switched over, bro.  I tried to give you guys a shot.  No good, dude.  I'm going back, bro.  I don't know what happened, man.  All right.  So turn your dial live on the show.  Shut the dial.  Don't tell me to turn the dial. 
[00:08:30]  Turn the dial.  Do it live on the show.  Do it live.  Let's see someone.  Let's see one person that has the balls to do it in front of our face.  We want to hear the radio actually turn over.  We want to hear ourselves first, and you're talking.  Then we want to hear you turn it away.  Yeah, Frank, the reason we say turn the dial, because one douchebag isn't going to make the difference.  So just do it and move on with your life.  Move on with your life.  Move on with your life.  And you'll be back, by the way.  All you do is whine, bro.  Whine.  Whine. 
[00:09:00]  Who's whining now?  You're the one that's whining, my friend.  You're whining.  You're whining that you don't like a show.  Your show sucks.  And instead of just changing the channel, you call up and whine?  Hey, I'll do you one better.  Fuck off.  Oh, wow.  He got us.  He cursed.  Ew.  Oh, he got us.  Something tells me, first of all, he hasn't been listening for five months.  Of course he hasn't.  That's like his first time listening. 
[00:09:30]  Or he doesn't even listen.  Or he listens all the time.  Or he never listens.  I don't know.  He said he was listening to Howard, then he turned on.  What, did you get satellite and then listen to this station again?  Like you bought satellite and then just decided not to listen to it?  Yeah.  So he had both satellite things.  Stop it.  Let's just stop.  What you missed in that phone call was him telling us to F off.  There you go.  F off.  There you go.  Oh, Frank.  And we lost a dude that was talking about the Pittsburgh Morning Show.  So, God, what a weird start to this show today. 
[00:10:00]  Let's say hi to Adam in Massachusetts.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, Owen?  Hey, listen, I had a, I was hoping maybe this morning you guys could wake up the alcoholics  this morning.  Are you one of these alcoholics?  No, I'm not an alcoholic.  But, you know, it'd be pretty funny to hear some of these guys wake up all, you know, every  morning, maybe apologizing to his wife, but doing something stupid.  You know, your typical loser that, you know, basically has nothing to live for.  Not a reformed guy.  We want the drunks. 
[00:10:30]  That's right.  Yeah, waking up the drunks.  I don't think they're getting up this early.  I was going to say, I don't think they're up.  I don't think anything we do can wake them up.  Yeah, they're the irresponsible ones.  They're sleeping in.  They're calling in sick.  They're making all sorts of excuses why they're hungover.  I'd like to hear some of these people call up, you know, nothing to live for.  Maybe, you know, see why they're even alive on this planet.  I'm not really feeling the, you know, the wake up a group of people bit today.  No.  No.  Hold on.  We have another person. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, we can.  We can.  How about.  Oh, he went away.  Oh, he went away.  Someone from Staten Island.  I agree.  You guys suck.  We can do that.  We can wake up the people that think we suck, but they're listening to our show.  There you go.  Adam, I don't know if waking up the alcoholics is going to get the job done today.  All right, guys.  Listen, punch it out.  All right.  Someone else suggested we wake up the fatties, the women that might be overweight, the guys  that might be overweight, but I guess when you talk about fatties, you're talking about  women that are overweight.  Yeah.  Because they have to start their day, too. 
[00:11:30]  Getting up eating.  Kenny, another Kenny from Philly, he thought we should wake up the suicide girls.  I didn't even know what those were.  Oh, yeah.  This website's dedicated to the suicide girls.  They got kind of a goth look, sort of.  Goth piercings?  They got the lip piercings, and they're all about possibly killing themselves.  And being very, like, depressed.  Yeah.  We could do that.  Isn't that like emo?  It's probably an offshoot of emo.  Although, I don't want to get into that again. 
[00:12:00]  Boy, we'll open that can of worms that we don't know what the hell emo is.  Oh, here's the thought.  Yeah, I read that.  I read the message board.  You're jackasses.  They're like, anyone else get douche chills when Opie and Anthony talked about emo?  Talk about not being in touch.  In touch?  Shut up.  Touch yourself with a 45 right to your head.  Who put the post boo-hoo at whack bag?  The funny part about that is, like, you ask five people that swear they know emo and ask them what it's about, they'll give you five different answers. 
[00:12:30]  Five different answers.  No one knows what it is, officially.  But anyone that talks about it, that says they know what it is, absolutely knows what it is, and you can't sway them.  Oof.  It's the dump.  First of all, the name itself is gay.  It's gay.  Here's my interpretation of emo.  Guys who have no problem having sex with each other, with other guys. 
[00:13:00]  It's pretty much it.  That's it.  Gay guys and girls that are fag hags that like to hang out with them, and they've come up with a new name.  Wow.  Emo.  You just missed everybody else.  Made it close to homo.  That's my interpretation.  I have no idea.  They kiss each other hello, the guys.  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to figure it out.  What?  Emo guys kiss each other?  Emo guys kiss each other hello. 
[00:13:30]  Open mouth kissing?  Yeah.  Full on, open mouth kissing?  And then flies come down, and just, it's a party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  All right.  Someone's suggesting we wake up the cutters.  Cutters.  We can wake up the cutters today.  Those are girls, too, though.  Huh?  Those are girls, too, for the most part.  No, no, no.  That's with the N.  Oh, right.  Not many guys are cutters.  Those are like a lot of girls are cutters. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, we could, like, wake up the attention-seeking girls.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Brian in New York.  Brian, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Good morning, Brian.  Well, you always gotta talk about the emos all the time.  No, I'm just kidding.  I could tell you really weren't committed to that.  No.  No, I was just joking.  I'm kind of proud to admit I don't really know much about emo.  Yeah, man.  They're a bunch of idiots. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know about them either.  But anyway.  I know I like some of the bands that would be thrown in the emo category, I guess.  But I don't really understand what the definition of emo is.  And we're not going to get into it today because we're going to get five different answers again.  Sounds good.  But listen, let me just touch on this real quick.  Yeah.  Last week, you guys were talking about amputees.  Well, over the weekend, I was trying to search out this horrific stuff.  I ended up finding this site called Gimps Gone Wild.  And it's nasty people. 
[00:15:00]  Most horrific things you've ever seen.  People with spina bifida and quadro and paraplegics and stuff.  All dressed in all sexy, sitting in wheelchairs.  This horrific stuff, man.  Punching out.  Jimmy, I love you.  We'll see you.  Bye, sir.  Gimps Gone Wild.  Is that better than Granny Island?  That website, Granny Island.  Granny Island.  All right.  Now we've got a problem.  Bob in Pittsburgh.  Bob, what's up?  Oh, no.  Not much, buddy.  Not much, buddy.  Just listening to you this morning.  It feels like you don't have anything going on today. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, no.  You started slow.  Usually, I would be laughing my head off on my way towards you.  But there's nothing funny in your show today.  Shouldn't you be taking calls from Microsoft customer service?  You load.  Your name isn't Bob.  Stop it.  Just stop.  My name is Bob.  You're a liar.  What's your real name, Bob?  What's your real name?  Yeah.  Not the name you've got to give the people when they're trying to call for help. 
[00:16:00]  Is?  Okay.  Why don't you help us?  Is your radio show plugged in?  Is your radio show's monitor on?  Is your radio show...  Did you put in the DVD?  No, no, no, no.  I really like your show.  You know, the thing that I really like about you, like I said, is that you don't use a lot  of toilet humor, and you still sound good in the morning.  We don't use a lot of what humor?  What's that?  Toilet humor.  Oh, toilet humor.  I never heard the opening.  Yeah, toilet humor.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  I like Holly.  You know, he uses a lot of humor.  All right, listen.  We got to go.  We got Gimps Gone Wild on the screen.  Gimps Gone Wild.  Thank you, sir, Bob.  Okay.  Okay, bye-bye.  He used to listen to Howard, likes the show, but...  I think he was fooling around.  But for some reason, the first 12 minutes didn't make him laugh, so now he thinks we're  having a slow day or something.  Wow.  Gimps Gone Wild is a great website.  It really is like Gimps with lingerie.  I'm looking at a girl with only one leg.  The rest of her isn't bad.  She's in tiny red panties, one high-heel shoe. 
[00:17:00]  Of course.  I wish you put the other one.  Her boob.  And she's posing very sexy on a chair.  Yeah, look at that.  Look at that.  As sexy as she can.  There it is.  She's called Lady in Red.  Look at that.  She's got red panties, red bra, and one red high-heel stripper shoe.  Ew.  And no leg.  Where are the garters?  No left leg.  One just hanging, dangling.  It's in a box full of the other left things.  Yeah, it's just a box with a Sharpie on the lid that just says, left things. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, wow.  That's a fetish for people, man.  Yeah, I know.  Stumps or whatever.  Yeah, we were talking about that last week, and somebody steered us toward a video of a girl  with a stump, and she was with another girl, and she was doing things to the girl with  her stump.  Well, she was missing her foot, I believe.  Yeah, her foot was really gone, and I'll tell you, her entire calf, just amazing, very 
[00:18:00]  impressive.  Holy crap, man.  Gim's gone wild.  You click on a girl, move up.  And then they listed disability.  It's always something you can't pronounce.  Disability Osteogenesis Imperfecta.  And then you click on that, and you get to see the photos of this fine young, oh my god! 
[00:18:30]  What is that one dressed like?  It's Neo.  Oh my god, I can't even, she can't be more than four foot tall.  Well, it's basically if you took like a regular-sized girl and just put her in a compactor and squished  her.  Squished her?  That's what she looks like, basically.  She's squished down to half the size of a normal-sized woman.  Is she showing some dirty things?  Well, these are just the samples.  You gotta, you gotta sign up. 
[00:19:00]  It looks like, it looks like a pedophile's sight because she's an adult, but it doesn't  look like she's an adult because she's so small.  Oh.  Yeah.  And she's got, she's all twisted into all sorts of different shapes.  She's in a wheelchair with lingerie on.  She, that's her attempt at being on, let's just say, being on her belly.  Yeah.  What size is this?  This is ProChoice.com?  This is Gim's Gone Wild.  Oh my god!  What is that?  Stop it.  Wow. 
[00:19:30]  This is really, really disturbing.  What is it?  They're gimps, but they're looking sexy for you, eh?  That's not sexy.  They're trying to look sexy for you.  That's frightening.  That's like something out of the ring.  Should be crawling out of a well.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to Rob in Brooklyn.  Rob, what's going on?  Yeah, Hope, I gotta call you out, man.  You ruined my whole weekend.  Why?  I was spending my whole weekend picturing my grandmother.  Oh. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, dude.  You can't be doing that to people anymore.  Yeah, the grandma thing.  There are people walking by FH Riley's just going, picture your grandma naked.  You guys talk about cringe radio all the time.  I'm sitting there listening to the radio cringing.  Right.  I'm looking into the fetal position over that.  So, ruined three days of my life, oh.  Hey, someone is saying, Andrew from Pittsburgh, that guy Bob that called in is Baghdad Bob from the 102.5 WVE morning show in Pittsburgh. 
[00:20:30]  Looks like it is time to attack guys.  The what?  So, I guess he works for DVE.  That's what we're hearing.  Could anyone, like, back that up?  I have no idea.  If that's true, it could get very, very interesting.  It's one of the bigger shows in Pittsburgh.  Maybe they're running a little scared.  Maybe they're running a little scared.  Can we isolate that phone call?  Now I've got to find out.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  Jim Norton back in the house.  We've got MacBooks to give away all this week. 
[00:21:00]  Thanks to MacBook Karaoke.  We start that today.  Oh, we get to listen to some contestants.  Yes, we do.  Wonderful.  Yes, we do.  And sometime today when Anthony's ready, he may want to talk about something that just infuriated me.  Oh, you.  If you saw it and I, like, hanging out, talking for, like, an hour at FH Riley's, Anthony was filling me in on some things, and it just infuriated me.  But it's up to Anthony to decide when he wants to talk about that. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, of course.  Maybe after the break.  We'll see.  Piss me off.  It's Opie and Anthony and old Jimmy Norton.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  I want to say good morning to Pittsburgh, especially today. 
[00:22:00]  I guess they're on our radar.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We had some douche call in right off the bat saying we're not funny, that he turned off Howard to listen to us, which is complete bull crap.  Yeah.  Gave us a chance for five months, and now he's going back to Howard.  And we said, well, then go back to Howard.  Do it live on our show.  We don't give a crap.  One person's opinion isn't going to make or break the show.  And he didn't do it.  He just cursed and hung up.  And then I guess we got him so annoyed, yeah, he cursed us out and hung up, so we had to dump out. 
[00:22:30]  And then somebody said that it could be this character Baghdad Bob.  I thought that was the Indian-speaking guy.  The one I think is the Microsoft thing I call it.  His name was Bob, and he, you know, had an accent.  Well, which guy are they talking about now?  And I think that Bob guy, but the Bob guy was just joking because he said, no, I like your show.  Wasn't the other guy Bob, too?  Now I'm really confused.  I don't know.  Frank was the guy who didn't like the show.  Right.  Okay.  Well, something's going on with Pittsburgh. 
[00:23:00]  I think they might have, like, kind of got a little attack together.  Oh, really?  I think they might have a little attack going on.  I don't know.  Good luck to you.  Anyway, Andrew from Pittsburgh, he writes, I can't call from work or I'll get fired,  but that is definitely someone calling doing the Baghdad Bob thing.  I promise.  It may not be the actual guy from the show, but it is definitely one of their supporters  trying to F up your show.  That doesn't F up.  See, the type of show we have, that kind of thing doesn't really F up our show because  we don't care. 
[00:23:30]  It kind of plays right in.  It's sort of something for us to do and someone to talk to.  Yeah.  We don't care.  It's not like we have a schedule or you're ruining a bit when people call up.  We'll talk to you.  We don't care about that.  Well, someone explain.  That's out of Pittsburgh.  Yeah, sorry.  We don't know about it.  So the Indian sounding dude is possibly a character called Baghdad Bob?  Why would he be Indian sounding if he's Iraqi?  Oh, that's why that accent, I guess.  But I hear Indian. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, I heard Indian.  If you're going to do Baghdad Bob, wouldn't it be like a Middle Eastern accent?  Yeah.  Was that his attempt at a Middle Eastern accent?  That was an Indian accent.  It's not the show, though.  It's just some guy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  So if you know anything about that, help us out.  He's just.  Maybe it's a guy that does a little something for their morning show and that's his bit.  Is it?  I don't know.  Explain, please. 
[00:24:30]  1-866-313-FREE is our phone number.  Yeah, that's the thing.  That's the thing they don't understand.  The thing that annoys us the most is that we don't even understand what's going on.  Right, right.  Like it's not like you're so popular and well-known and you're throwing things out that a lot of people know about.  We just.  I don't understand what you're doing.  At least make it kind of entertaining.  Something.  All right.  Well, now we're all confused with that.  But by the end of the show, everything will make sense.  That's the beauty of us. 
[00:25:00]  We'll wrap it up for you in a nice little package.  So Anthony got some interesting news on Saturday, was it?  Before FH Riley's?  I think it was Friday.  It was Friday night, maybe.  Friday night?  It was whenever it was snowing.  Yeah, Friday night.  It's snowing and I look out the window and I see some guy knocking on my door.  So I'm like, all right, you know, whatever.  Go to the door.  Might be a package or something.  Some chubby guy.  Maybe some of your Nazi memorabilia, Rob.  Yeah, yeah, coming in.  You know, sign for it.  Right, sure.  Yeah, sign for it, of course. 
[00:25:30]  Lampshades, whatever.  And I open the door and he hands me a big stack of papers.  And, you know, I've been there before, so I know what that is.  You're being served.  You got served.  I got served.  Mm-hmm.  I got served.  Now, you've kind of been hinting in the last few months that this might be coming.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought it was coming.  Anthony's been divorced.  I don't even know how long.  Oh, forever.  Forever.  Please.  Seven years, something like that.  Six years.  It's been like, yeah, seven years, I guess. 
[00:26:00]  Seven years.  You've been divorced seven years.  Yeah.  And out of nowhere, you get served with papers, and now you've got to go back to court because  things aren't quite right in her world.  Things are...  We're according to her.  Let me tell you.  I'll make my statement.  Things are absolutely right.  Someone is sadly mistaken in her camp over there, the ex-wife's camp, sadly mistaken at  how much money I make. 
[00:26:30]  You know?  A lot of it is said on the show, and we goof around, and things have been printed in the  paper, which we laugh at because they're severely overblown amounts of money that they say that  we make.  And we just laugh.  We're like, yeah, okay, 30 million.  That's, you know, yeah, make $30 million.  When meanwhile, no, we don't.  It's only 20.  Yeah.  Come on.  Let's get real.  Now, that'll be in the paper.  He said he made $20 million.  But they're really sadly mistaken. 
[00:27:00]  Can I be completely honest?  Yeah.  I know we do very well.  Yeah.  And this might shock some people, knowing me and money.  I have no idea how much we make a year.  I have no clue.  I have no clue.  You don't know?  I swear to God, I could give you a number, and I could guess at it.  Yeah.  I never wanted to know.  So, there are also variables.  But the beauty of me, Anthony and I, we make exactly the same. 
[00:27:30]  So, in my weird world, I don't need to know, don't want to know.  I just want to know we're doing well.  But I have Anthony to make sure that everything's on the up and up.  Yeah, yeah.  I have the contracts at home.  If any question comes up, I look at it and see what we make.  Every once in a while, I'll ask Anthony a question about it, and he'll answer me.  I'm like, oh, all right.  That's what we make.  But as I sit here, I swear to God, I couldn't put a number on what we make a year.  Yeah.  And I like it that way for some weird – it just makes sense in my stupid head.  I kind of keep track. 
[00:28:00]  And Ant keeps track.  I keep track.  And that's why it's okay.  And the reason I keep track is because I have to keep track because I'm involved in a divorce where she has to get money based on how much I make.  So, you know, that's how I have to pay her.  See, so Jimmy's doing what I did all day Saturday.  Oh, just fuming.  I was telling Ant before the show in the office today, it's just amazing that in this world, you could say you don't want to be with a person anymore.  But then the courts will decide when you actually don't have to be with that person anymore as far as their involvement in your life. 
[00:28:30]  Anthony got divorced seven years ago.  I want no involvement with this person ever again.  I just don't want – I don't want to see her name.  I don't want to see her.  I want no involvement with this person.  That's it.  And before you even got divorced, it was a couple of years where you didn't want to have anything to do with her anymore.  And out of nowhere, thinking you've kind of moved on with your life except for having to sign up for a financial commitment, which is, you know, that to me, I've rationalized it to where it's just like business. 
[00:29:00]  It's like paying my American Express bill.  That's what it is.  She's a bill.  She's an entity to me that needs to be paid.  That's all.  And that's what I've been doing, just like I pay my other bills.  I pay the full amount, and I pay it on time.  And then I get this load of crap on Friday.  Just to bring everyone up to speed because we talked about it on the show, she's been writing on the back of the checks under protest. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like she's cashing these.  She's throwing it into some kind of bank account.  But under protest.  That's why Ant knew something was coming.  I knew something was up because you don't write something like that on a check unless you're gearing up to do something later so that you could pull out all these checks and go,  Well, see, I did cash in, but I was writing this.  And obviously someone was telling her to write that.  Yeah, someone's telling her.  She didn't think this up herself.  A big, fat, bloated mess of a person was telling her that.  Exactly.  It's so I get these papers, and there was a brand new deposition. 
[00:30:00]  That's her statement as to what is going on and why this whole case is being brought.  And it was nothing short of a fantasy novel, this whole thing, her statement.  And again, it brought up things with the marriage that are irrelevant at this point.  Here's what this amounts to now.  Because they think I'm making more money than I am, they want a complete assessment of what I make and my tax returns and stuff like that. 
[00:30:30]  And you know something, okay, I'm fine with that because I have absolutely nothing to hide.  Hand over my tax.  I'll give my tax returns over to a judge, whatever they need, to see how much I make.  And let's see if it matches with what I've been paying.  And you know what?  It will.  It'll absolutely match because I think you have this overinflated view of what I'm making. 
[00:31:00]  And they are in for a big surprise, a big, big surprise.  So she wants more money now, seven years later?  Apparently, they think I've been – and that's the thing.  Imagine if every time a bill came in, you paid it, like the American Express, let's say.  Comes in, you pay it, on time, in full, every single time you're supposed to pay it.  And then you get a lawsuit filed by American Express saying, hey, what's your problem? 
[00:31:30]  You're supposed to be paying us more and we're suing you.  You'd be livid.  And this is not even like American Express because this is not even a product you're getting to use.  This is interest on a product that was busted seven years ago.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  So the whole – the first part of it is the deposition, which is, you know, things about the marriage.  And this has nothing to do with that anymore.  This is a math figure. 
[00:32:00]  This is a math problem.  That's all it is.  It's how much do you make?  How much is she entitled to?  End of story.  This isn't any more about emotional damage and I was in love and he left me for another woman after nine years of marriage.  And seven years ago, he decided to leave me for another woman.  Did I?  Did I really? 
[00:32:30]  That's what the deposition said?  Yeah.  That was the statement in the deposition?  After her love and support of nine years, he left me for another woman.  Did – really?  Really?  Did I – did I just up and leave?  Or were there little circumstances that you're leaving out of the deposition that I won't leave out of mine?  I certainly won't.  You want to include that crap in there? 
[00:33:00]  How about three years into our marriage?  Three years into our marriage.  If that.  Let me think.  What year was that?  I was married in 90.  There was 91, 92, 93.  93, when did we go to Boston?  Boston around 95.  Five-ish.  Early 95.  So I'd say about – okay.  Yeah, like – I'd say three years into our marriage.  I'm at a gig.  Ope's there.  We're having a blast.  Drinking.  Having fun. 
[00:33:30]  We're getting ready to leave for Boston.  Getting ready to leave for Boston.  I remember this day like it's at the back of my hand because I'm having a great time.  Oh, it was great.  Like, Anthony, we're celebrating the fact that we're going to work together finally full-time  in Boston, do afternoon drive, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  And we're saying goodbye to the listeners that we had from BAB out there on Long Island.  Yeah.  Big party.  They kind of threw us like, all right, I'll see you later party.  And all of a sudden, it's still kind of early.  And it's like, I got to go.  I got to go.  I got to go.  Like, where are you going?  Yeah.  Where are you going?  I got to go.  And believe me, I wouldn't even be saying this if I thought for a second it was like 
[00:34:00]  a lie or dishonest because I could be held liable for what I'm saying.  But this is so absolutely the truth.  And there are people that saw it.  I saw it.  There could be witnesses that could come forward.  Can I be a witness?  Absolutely.  You're cordially invited to be a witness because you were there.  I was kind of pissed off.  I think my brother was there.  I think I was pissed off and jealous at the same time.  Because I had to leave. 
[00:34:30]  I had to leave immediately.  Two girls for every day.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  Well, the ex-wife comes up to me and informs me out of nowhere that a girl at the bar that  was hanging out there that we had been friends with for a while, this girl, Cindy, just use  her first name, girl named Cindy, had wanted to come home and have some sex with us.  Two girls for every boy. 
[00:35:00]  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  All of a sudden, Anthony looks at me.  Goodbye.  All of a sudden, Anthony looks at me.  Got to go, got to go, got to go, got to go.  Two girls for every boy.  I left a shape of me in the wall.  I've never seen someone leave a bar faster in my life.  Just drunk off his ass, like, just...  Oh, my God, I was praying, please, police, if there's any night, don't pull me over tonight. 
[00:35:30]  Please don't pull me over tonight.  I'm on my way home.  No, officer, it's like this.  Look.  Look, you can understand this.  You've got to understand.  If you want, I'll drink tomorrow and be right back at this spot, and you can arrest me tomorrow.  Look, I wasn't going to drink and try, but look what I've got going on in here.  Yeah, come on.  Help me out.  Help me out, sir.  Out of the blue, she just walks up and says...  The bottom line is, yeah, it was out of the blue. 
[00:36:00]  Out of the blue.  I saw the whole thing go down, like it was yesterday.  They were hanging out all night.  Yeah.  I was hanging out with Ope and just kind of talking about things, the BAB crew, things like that.  Just having fun, hanging out, and she was hanging out with this other girl all night.  And, you know, they'd been tying one on and stuff.  And apparently, the conversation that they were having had turned to that.  And then, before I knew it, I was being approached and said, hey, go back to our house with this girl. 
[00:36:30]  And the three of us will hook up and have some fun.  Two girls for every boy.  Bam.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Had you ever done anything like that in your life?  Nope.  That was first time.  Wow.  Yeah.  First time.  Fill it up.  You're filling up a little on this one?  So, at that point, like I said, three years in, right then, I knew something was amiss with the marriage. 
[00:37:00]  Because that stuff is all well and fine.  It's, believe me, a lot of fun.  You're not going to complain.  It's great.  As a guy, it's one of those things, again, number one fantasy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You're not going to complain when you're in it and you're in a drunken stupor.  But then, when you're back to regular life, you're like, hmm.  You're kind of thinking, yeah, all right, something's a little amiss.  You know, something's missing here.  If, you know, and this is, with all the love and support I gave as a wife, my wifely duties, my husband left me after, ah, shut up. 
[00:37:30]  So, what happened was, after that.  Wait a minute.  And that went on a couple of times, by the way.  Yeah, well, don't skip over that.  Oh, I'm not.  Was it really good?  I'm bossing over that.  Was it good?  It was a blast.  It was a lot of fun.  Did you focus on each person equally?  No.  How the hell would you do that?  That's stupid.  That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  You got a new broad laying there right there.  What are you going to do? 
[00:38:00]  It wasn't a 50-50 split.  Oh, 50-50.  Stop it.  It was 10-90.  95-5.  One got everything, and the old wife got a pat on the head.  A pat on the head.  Good girl.  Thank you.  Just waiting for her to pass out.  It was, yeah, exactly.  It was just, it was one of those, you know, one of those opportunities.  And that had happened a couple of times after that, you know, with the same girl, one of  those deals.  And then after that was done. 
[00:38:30]  Was there a Boston trip involved?  Boston trip?  I don't even remember.  I'm trying to remember.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember.  I don't remember.  But that went on.  I know it was a lot of times when we were, when we would drive back down to New York on  the weekends.  I think that's what I was saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you guys left Boston.  So we were still in Boston.  You know, we were living in Boston at that point, away from the situation, but came home  on the weekends, down to New York on the weekends, kind of a thing.  So that's, you know, that was how the whole thing started of blah, blah, blah. 
[00:39:00]  Where's my loving marriage?  Well, if it's such a great marriage, why the hell, you know, are you bringing your, your,  your bisexual tendencies into it?  And, uh, I want me involved in that whole situation.  Not that you were going to complain.  Because after that happened, because this girl wound up moving down to Florida and, uh,  it wasn't available anymore.  And all I heard, all I heard for a few years after that was, how can we do that again? 
[00:39:30]  Got to find somebody.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  This is where it gets uncomfortable.  That was it.  I got to turn around.  This is the only time I get uncomfortable.  That was it.  No, that, that was, that was how uncomfortable it was.  It was getting also.  Can I turn back?  She would just keep, yeah, you can turn around.  All right.  She would keep wondering, you know, oh, well, blah, blah, blah.  How are we going to do this?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Nine years.  I gave him nine years.  My husband then left me seven years ago.  I left because I couldn't be married anymore to you. 
[00:40:00]  That's why I left because, uh, there, there was nothing, there was nothing left to the  marriage anymore.  It wasn't one of those, um, it wasn't a marriage where, where, you know, there was this loyalty  to each other.  She, she was obviously on the prowl, you know, on the prowl.  And, uh, I'd had it at that point, you know, I was done and happened to, uh, happened to 
[00:40:30]  find someone I'd rather be with, and that was seven years ago, still with the girl.  And very happy.  Very happy.  Very happy.  Seven years ago.  So it's not like I'm bouncing around like a whore, uh, uh, to, uh, 20 different girls.  I found somebody that I, I'm happy with, uh, that I don't have to throw over my shoulder  and drag out of a bar.  You know, that's a plus.  Oh boy.  I got to turn around again.  You know, I never understood how important locomotion is to a marriage, how important 
[00:41:00]  the ability to move by oneself is in a marriage.  And, uh, you know, that was, but, but the, the deposition that I read was, oh, you know,  I gave so much and helped in his career and this, that.  And again, this has nothing to do with this case that's coming up.  This is purely a financial money, two plus two equals four kind of a thing. 
[00:41:30]  It has nothing to do anymore.  The divorce thing, you know, they pulled all that emotional crap out, but this has nothing  to do with that.  So it shouldn't even have been included in, in the deposition.  But the fantasy that just went on about how, you know, hurt she was and what a scumbag I  was for leaving.  That's why I left.  There was nothing left.  There was no love in, in that marriage.  And then why can't you just frigging leave? 
[00:42:00]  You got to be saddled with a debt.  And with now I got to look at her effing face in a courtroom again, by the way, everyone's  cordially invited.  It's April 12th at the courthouse in New York city.  I believe it's 60 center street.  Your shorts to 12th.  You gave me another date.  No, it's to the 12th.  I remember you gave me another date on Saturday.  That's all.  Cause I already wrote it down my calendar.  It's center street.  Please come one, come all. 
[00:42:30]  Have fun.  Sit in on the gallery and watch and have fun.  What day of the week is that?  I believe it's a Thursday.  I'm not sure.  I think it is.  Look, look how excited.  Come down, have some fun.  Should we call the papers?  Call the papers.  Everyone, just everybody.  Let's have a little part.  I want everyone to come in and get a good look at the proceedings and see what's really  going on with this and see bloated attorney, Dominic Barbara, try to pull a fast  one on me. 
[00:43:00]  Let me tell you something.  I'm certainly not the same guy I was seven years ago.  I'm not as naive and idealistic and trusting as I was seven years ago.  Um, I, I'm a lot more jaded.  My eyes are opened.  I'm a lot wiser than I was seven years ago.  You fat ass, you jack off.  Well, he wants, I'm not going to sit there and be harassed and be, uh, uh, uh, bullied 
[00:43:30]  by the likes of you, you yapping head.  You're a talking head.  You want fame more than anything else.  You're a fame monger who, who, who just, uh, uh, uh, will, will at the drop of a hat,  go on any TV or radio show to try to get your name out there.  And that's a lot more important to you than, um, any type of justice or, or, or what, what  you're supposed to stand for.  Aren't you supposed to pay his lawyer fees too, according to this paperwork you got? 
[00:44:00]  Apparently, of course, you know, the, the woman's never supposed to pay any legal fees and I'm  supposed to like now bend over and pay.  There was something in this deposition that said, I brought in, get this, I brought in  a, uh, high powered team of attorneys to intimidate my ex.  Meanwhile, I had one lawyer who barely handled this case.  I mean, the guy, it was probably the worst mistake I've ever made in my life. 
[00:44:30]  I didn't go and get like a Ralph Felder or one of these high powered attorneys.  I got a guy that I think he did like contract laws for like financial things.  He wasn't a divorce attorney even because I assumed for a 25 G's, which I paid him, which  for a lawyer is nothing like my high powered team of attorneys cost me about 25 G's.  Meanwhile, I paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for her.  Now, meanwhile, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had, I had nobody as an attorney. 
[00:45:00]  And then in this deposition, it's like he hired a team of high powered attorneys.  It's like, what?  That's a lie.  It's a blatant lie.  And then there's mistakes.  But that doesn't matter.  In there, there's, there's all kinds of errors in the deposition of, of monies and things  like that.  So they are really, really, you don't even understand.  And I know the, the, the fat ass, the fat F is, is listening in, taping this to use against 
[00:45:30]  me or something like that.  That's fine.  And well, uh, you, you are in for a really big surprise when you see what we make and  what I have paid her, uh, as per the settlement.  Let me ask you a question.  When you have to pay, which is sick, you have to pay her legal fees.  Were you able to contest what her lawyer charges her?  Like, can he just charge whatever he wants?  And they, and they like, what's to prevent a lawyer from overcharging?  Cause you're going to have to pay it.  Let me give you a little scenario, Jim. 
[00:46:00]  Here's what it's like.  You're in a boxing ring.  You hope that the fight will be over after the third round by round 10, your face is smashed  in, you're on the canvas bleeding.  You just don't get up.  If you got up to try to, you know, figure out how much this one's owed and this one that  you're just going to get punched in the face more.  And that's what I was.  I was on the canvas down for the count. 
[00:46:30]  And I said, you know something?  I give up.  I give up.  I, and that, that's how things get settled.  That's how divorces get settled.  They beat the crap out of the guy until he gives up.  Do you know most divorces never go to trial?  They never end with a trial.  They are, most of them are settled.  They just wear you down.  They wear you down and beat you up.  It also said.  I saw that happen to Anthony.  It was so frustrating.  Anthony's the nicest guy.  He really is an unbelievable guy.  And to see that he has to go through this crap. 
[00:47:00]  I've gone above and beyond.  Just, just infuriates me on a level I can't even explain.  I've gone above and beyond.  And, and, and, and to, to read that I, you know.  Technically, she probably owes Anthony money.  I get this also.  Technically, she probably owes Anthony money.  Probably.  She should just shut her mouth and take her stupid paycheck she gets every month and do  it, and do what she's doing with it.  It not only said that, um, I hired a high powered team of attorneys, but at every turn,  I delayed the, um, I delayed the proceedings. 
[00:47:30]  Meanwhile, I was trying to get this done as quickly as possible.  You used to scream on the air that you just wanted it over.  And, and court dates would come up and they would cancel.  They would cancel court dates and postpone and postpone.  I was ready to roll.  They would postpone, postpone, postpone.  So another blatant lie to get the lawyer fees up and to get me to sign another contract.  If you remember, I was signing a new contract with Infinity Broadcasting at the time. 
[00:48:00]  And me, as the guy, I wanted to get this divorce done before I signed my new deal.  Plus, you want to move on.  I want to move on my life and sign it before a new deal because she wasn't entitled to anything  with the new deal because she's not even involved with that.  Of course, that didn't pan out.  So they delayed and delayed and delayed at every turn.  And then I read a deposition that I just get now on Friday that says, oh, he delayed.  He did this.  He did that.  Everything that she did, her side did, they're blaming me for doing. 
[00:48:30]  It's just blatant lying.  Lies.  And I got to sit now.  I got to deal with this again.  Seven years later, I got to deal with more court proceedings and bull crap because perhaps,  I don't know, and I have no proof of that.  This isn't anything that's anything.  This is my personal opinion that I believe perhaps she's not banking money like she should 
[00:49:00]  have been.  I'm giving a lot of money, relatively speaking, to a lot of the 99% of the workforce out there.  She's making a lot of money.  It's a great living.  It's a great living.  And perhaps if she had spent that time maybe, I don't know, getting a skill for a job because  eventually this does end.  This does end eventually.  The gravy train stops.  I do not.  There's a set period of time that I pay.  When that stops, is she going to have a marketable skill? 
[00:49:30]  She's going to have to go to work.  Look, I mean, it's not, you know, as far as I'm concerned, maybe she should have been  saving a little more, doing a little more, and not paying her lawyer as much money as  she is to do these things.  Because I'll tell you another thing.  I really don't think I'm going to have to pay the lawyer fee this time, and that's going  to come out of someone's pocket.  It ain't going to be mine.  And if you have to foot that nut, that's going to be a tough one for you, as far as 
[00:50:00]  I'm concerned.  All right.  Good luck to you.  We should take a break.  But that's the hell I'm in right now.  But people should, people are calling like crazy.  Maybe we could take a few calls for the break.  But that's the hell that Anthony had a deal with over the weekend.  Thought it was all, you know, I had fallen into a, you know, kind of a routine with it.  Like, all right, I accept it.  That's what I have to do.  I just, you know, the countdown's on.  But now I got to, like, I got to, I don't even want to look at that face. 
[00:50:30]  I don't even want to have to look at it.  And now I'm being forced to.  You need to get a lawyer?  Not the same one as last time?  Oh, believe me.  It ain't going to be him.  It ain't going to be him, Dominic.  Phones are lit.  It's not going to be that easy this time.  We said in the office, like, you decide somewhere along that, all right, I'm not this person anymore.  But the courts and the lawyers and the divorce proceedings, they're the ones that actually decide when you.  I paid through the time we weren't working.  People advised me.  They said, dude, you know what you should do?  You should go to court and have it so you don't have to pay her because you're not working. 
[00:51:00]  It's like, well, you know, I'm still getting paid under contract because, yeah, but then people said, yeah, but you don't know what's going to happen afterwards.  You know, you could be completely out of work and blackball.  They were saying, you know, I heard on TV a lot of times these guys ain't working again.  The offers weren't rolling in, that's for sure.  So I didn't know if after that two years was up, if I was ever going to see another dime of radio money again.  But that was what I was supposed to do, so I did it.  And, you know, thank God we wound up getting another job. 
[00:51:30]  And it puts me back in this position.  Lots of fun.  All right, we'll take some phone calls next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We got to go right to the phones.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's say hi to Eddie in New Jersey.  Eddie, what's going on today?  Hey, Anthony.  How you doing, buddy?  Listen, I can feel your pain.  I don't know what it is with these women.  They have no dignity or pride about themselves.  It's like they're just sitting back waiting for a welfare check and being a welfare case every month. 
[00:52:00]  I just don't get it.  You know, there are a lot of women who, when they get divorced, think that the gravy train lasts forever.  These women should probably spend their time going to school.  You know, a lot of people have to work and go to college at the same time.  This is an opportunity for these women to actually go to college full time so that when the gravy train runs out, they have a nice marketable skill. 
[00:52:30]  They can get a good job and maybe keep the lifestyle they were leading instead of, you know, what the hell are they going to do?  Women don't want to look like second-class citizens until they get divorced.  Yeah, then please.  And then they have no problem saying they're a weaker species.  I'm so weak.  I can't do anything.  They need someone to take care of them.  Exactly.  What I don't understand is how did she help your career?  What did you do?  Sit back and watch you go on the air?  That's a whole other thing.  We've been through that 800 times.  It didn't, in the long run, it didn't matter because, like I said, most divorces never go to trial. 
[00:53:00]  They always settle.  So if it would have went to trial, who knows what would have happened.  It's one of those things where maybe I would have been, the judge would have said, yeah, nothing was done.  She didn't contribute at all, so you get nothing.  Or maybe the judge would have went, well, she contributed 50%, so now you've got to give her half.  You know, that's that unknown factor that makes people settle.  And, you know, that's why I said a lot of divorces end in settlements.  That's just what happens. 
[00:53:30]  They knock you down.  They beat you up.  They give you these scenarios that are 10 times worse than what you could possibly imagine.  So that's what happens.  I hear you, buddy.  Well, good luck, man.  Yeah, thanks.  Good luck, man.  All right, Eddie, thank you.  Let's go to Dominic Barbera from Long Island.  Dominic.  Anthony.  That's sure it doesn't sound like him, but okay.  Hey, what kind of car are you driving now, Anthony?  I drive a nice Mustang.  All right, get out of here. 
[00:54:00]  Let's go to Steve in Queens.  That was the worst impression.  How did you cut that amazing bit off?  What an ass.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, Anthony, will you marry me?  Why?  Sounds like a nice way to make a living, you know?  Yeah.  Really?  You'd never have to work?  That's it.  It's nice.  You don't have to, like, maybe, you don't have to go back to school.  You don't have to look for a job.  You don't even have to drive.  No.  You don't even have to drive a car. 
[00:54:30]  Nope.  Sweet.  She doesn't even drive a car.  It's a great living.  And I were on top of the radio world when this whole thing was going down.  And she would take the bus.  Yeah.  To the supermarket.  Mm-hmm.  Anthony was a radio star.  And his wife at the time was on a town bus.  She never wanted to drive for some reason.  I don't know.  How about you start there and get a license?  Sorry.  Maybe I should just shut up. 
[00:55:00]  That's true.  This just bothers me, too.  Jeff in Boston, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  It's Jared in Boston.  Anthony, I know exactly what you're dealing with.  My best friend, every five years, his ex-wife does this.  And actually, the other day, she said to him, you know, let's go see Jimmy Norton at  Kowloon's in Saugus on Thursday.  And then Friday and Saturday at Comedy Connection in Boston.  Call 617-248-9700.  Ooh.  Well, I wouldn't take her.  You know why?  Because it's an ex.  And you shouldn't date your exes, even if it is to go see Jimmy Norton at those fine 
[00:55:30]  establishments.  Anthony's going through hell here.  And you get your little plug in, Jimmy.  Dude, it's like, come on.  The timing is awful today, I got to say.  Dude, why would you call up with that?  And you forget Wednesday in Rhode Island.  I mean, what kind of a call is that?  Well, my friend here is suffering.  Right.  To forget Wednesday in Rhode Island is ridiculous.  My good friend here is having financial woes.  It does not say much for marriage, though, when, like, I've never been married, and I'm  hearing your tale, and I'm just, I'm clenching my teeth like it happened to me. 
[00:56:00]  It is infuriating.  But in all fairness, you got to know who you're marrying, too, because even Anthony admitted,  like, on his wedding night, he went, oh, God, I'm in a mistake.  I just knew that'd be trouble.  By the way, happy anniversary.  Today is your anniversary.  According to statements you made in the courtroom, I believe today is your anniversary.  Wait, no, no, no.  As I recall now, I was asked, and I forgot.  That was written in the paper, by the way.  That wasn't part of any confidential courtroom banter that went down. 
[00:56:30]  This was written in the paper because there was a New York Post and Daily News guy in the gallery when this happened.  I was asked, when is your wedding anniversary?  And I was like, um...  He did not know.  I couldn't remember because I knew March 19th had been important to me for so many years because it was Swallows Day in San Juan Capistrano.  And growing up in San Juan Capistrano, it was a very important day. 
[00:57:00]  It was the day of, you know, the day the Swallows come back to Capistrano.  And there's a big parade and everything.  And I got confused March and May.  My anniversary is May 19th, Opie.  Yeah.  So you're a couple of months early.  Hey, just take like 20 seconds.  There are people just getting in their cars.  What the hell happened?  They know it's kind of big news in your life.  So out of nowhere, Anthony got served papers for something he thought was over with with his ex.  Yeah, apparently they think I'm making more money than I'm making. 
[00:57:30]  And they want money from me.  They're dragging Anthony back to court, even though his divorce has been final for about seven years.  Seven years or so.  What are you going to do?  Is it possible for you to sue her for legal fees?  Because there are things like frivolous harassment.  Yeah, they do that.  Yeah, that's possible.  Me and my legal team are considering all options, Jim.  That's what I'll say.  All options are open to us right now.  I say you make her suffer now because you've been just a nice guy through this whole thing. 
[00:58:00]  You really have.  I say you make her suffer now.  I've reached my limit.  And as I said, I was looking at this as just another bill to pay and kind of rationalizing it like that.  But I'm not the same guy I was seven years ago.  I'm not going to just kind of sit down and take it with my cheap lawyer that I thought I'd be able to get away cheap with and got hammered pretty badly.  It's not going to happen this time. 
[00:58:30]  Booby man from Brooklyn.  I see you guys woke up the truly effed wallet drained guys.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Joel in Glen Oaks.  Joel, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Listen, three years I was getting a divorce.  Three years I was looking for a divorce.  I have money.  All of a sudden, the only way I can get a divorce is by claiming bankruptcy within three days the papers were signed.  Yeah, there you go.  I guess what we're talking about today, though, is, I mean, the whole divorce proceedings in general suck. 
[00:59:00]  But it just amazes me that Anthony wanted to move on with his life, has moved on with his life.  And out of nowhere, he's now got to deal with his ex.  Again.  Again.  All I could say without going into details, because I can't.  I'm precluded from going into any details on this thing.  But all I'll say is I have gone, little do they know, because apparently they believe I'm making a lot more than I am making.  But I have gone above and beyond my commitment. 
[00:59:30]  I have a commitment that I'm supposed to make with paying her support.  That's what you do when you get divorced.  You've got to pay the wife, the ex-wife.  And I've gone above and beyond what I am actually supposed to do.  And one of the options I have now is looking back and seeing where I went above and beyond and maybe taking some of that back. 
[01:00:00]  Where that will end up will be, I think, somebody will owe me money.  How could you not be able to at least use the product, though?  If you're still paying for it, you should be able to borrow it.  No, he doesn't want to, Jimmy.  But maybe one of your friends does.  If you own something, if you're not driving a car and I need a ride, you could say, hey, go take the jalopy.  Go take the jalopy out for a ride.  So maybe one time I go, you know what, Ant?  Look at this thing.  It's dry.  And you go, you know what?  I know where you can go to wet it. 
[01:00:30]  I got you.  I'm paying for something down the road.  Absolutely.  That, Jimmy makes a good point.  Yeah.  You ought to loan it out to your pals.  I wouldn't, my worst enemy, never mind my friends.  What?  So she could use those talons, those frigging nails?  Cut your nails.  Let me give you a little advice.  Cut your nails.  That crap went out in the 80s.  The goddamn vulture nails she's got.  I got to turn around again.  Is that for swooping in on wallets?  You grab them out of back pockets? 
[01:01:00]  Those talons?  Enough with your talons.  Are you done?  Christ on a pony.  Can I turn back around?  Yeah, you could turn around.  I swear to God, it's the only time I get uncomfortable on this show.  Jesus.  Let's say hi to Steven.  Get another tattoo.  Get another tattoo.  What's wrong with tattoos?  Because you're in your 40s now.  You're not a kid anymore.  Surprise.  Surprise, you're in your 40s.  Get another tattoo.  Why don't you get one of my bank account number on your back? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, boy.  I got to turn around again.  It's done you well.  I'm telling you.  E-Rock, tell me when he's done.  Is he done?  Get that one.  Not going to look so cute behind the bar anymore when that has to happen after two more years  of me paying you off.  What's going to happen after that?  Where are you going to go?  You got a job?  You got a marketable skill?  Or are you going to hit those gin mills again?  Because let me tell you something.  They don't tip as well when you're in your 40s as they did when you were in your 20s and early  30s.  Oh, 41? 
[01:02:00]  It don't happen anymore.  The kids don't want to tip the waitress or the bartender unless they think they're going  to get a chance with her.  What about like a Japanese tattoo with some of that?  Yeah, get that.  Or Chinese, whatever it is.  Get that.  Where it means something.  What's the Japanese word for leech?  Let's say hi to Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Man, this has been going on for years.  And it's like, God, man, when is this ever going to end?  I mean, I'm sure that not in your stomach. 
[01:02:30]  You got to throw up when you see that.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Well, I'm a new guy these days.  I really am.  I just kind of, I took it, where it would have been, I would have taken it out.  And I did, like years ago on the process server, the guy that just comes and delivers the court  papers to you, tells you when the appearance date is.  Like, I unloaded on him the first time, like years ago.  Now, the guy came to the door.  He's like, are you, Anthony?  Here's the papers.  And I'm like, all right.  Thanks a lot. 
[01:03:00]  Drive safe.  It was icy out.  You know, I'm not going to kill the messenger.  Is it true you offered him a Bud Light?  I had him come in.  We had a Bud Light together.  It was one, and then he was late.  He had to go serve some more papers.  Hey, it's always worth it, so, you know.  I'm a nice guy.  We do.  We sucked down a couple of Bud Lights, and he was off on his way in the snow.  He said we sat in front of the Java log for a while.  All right, enough.  You're married for a couple of years, you know.  Fortunately, you know, it was a miserable marriage.  And why should we have to pay for it, you know, half our lives after the divorce happens? 
[01:03:30]  I don't know.  It's crap.  I don't know.  It should be done and over with.  Yeah.  And the big C, I'm sure, you know, she's laughing her ass off about this, but, you know, we  shouldn't have to pay for it our whole lives because of their misery.  Well, when's the court date at?  April 12th.  April 12th.  All right.  We've got to be in on April 12th.  I'll be there.  Yeah.  I'll be there supporting my pal.  Where's the courthouse? 
[01:04:00]  Downtown?  Yeah, because we're flying out when?  For, um...  I think the week after that.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, no.  We've got the 14th.  The next day.  We're doing, so we're flying out the next day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  No!  I'm flying out that...  All right, start on.  April 14th.  We're leaving the 20th, I believe.  No, no, no.  Not vacation.  We're doing...  Oh, Vegas.  Vegas.  Oh, okay.  You're right.  The virus tour.  The ONA Traveling Virus comedy tour in Vegas.  So, I know.  We've got 12.  12.  Thank you, Master.  All the info's on opnit.com. 
[01:04:30]  Go ahead.  I'm going to miss that thing, because I'm flying out that Thursday.  Oh, you are.  Again, I'm going to miss his court day.  Yep.  Well...  All right.  Well, thanks, guys.  And, uh, frunkus.  Thank you, sir.  Frunkus.  So, maybe...  Let's just...  Can we talk to the judge and move that?  Let's say hi to Eddie and Brooklyn.  Yeah, we'll have to move it.  Ed, my friend wants to watch you, Ron.  Yeah, my friend wants to hang out and watch.  Eddie!  Yeah?  What's up?  How you doing, man?  What's up, man?  All right.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I went through a similar situation, and when  I try to recoup any kind of monies or try to talk to the judge about what I did above 
[01:05:00]  and beyond, what was expected of me in the settlement, well, he told me, well, you're  a really nice guy.  I didn't have to do any of that.  Hey, you're a real nice guy.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Thanks a lot, you know?  That sucks.  It did.  It did.  It really did.  Because I thought, you know, my position was that if I gave her the money, I wasn't  sure it was going to be put to the right things, like for their schooling.  Oh, see, you got child stuff.  That's different. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  All right.  That's different.  Hey, this just in.  My brother, Elmo, is in the middle of making a t-shirt for Anthony's April 12th court appearance.  Oh, great.  Get the t-shirts.  We'll be throwing them around.  Wow stickers.  We'll give them out.  What is this guy Jack saying?  Let's go to Jack.  Hey, Jack.  What's up there?  Yeah.  Hello.  Hi, Jack.  I just think you're adding more fuel to the fire.  How's that?  Well, just, you know, back off and, you know, suck it up. 
[01:06:00]  We share everything on the show as much as we can.  I've backed off and sucked it up for years.  That's right.  And everything was hunky-dory.  I understand.  But if you're going to court, you're only adding more fuel to the fire.  You know what?  I'm adding fuel I want put on the fire.  That's exactly what I'm doing.  I'm saying exactly what I want to say here on the air.  And I don't care if they record it and play it back in the courtroom.  This is what happened. 
[01:06:30]  These are facts that I'm saying.  This isn't some deposition full of crap that is full of lies and inconsistencies and numerical errors.  There are actually errors in there in the math.  I'm not denying that.  And I wish you all the luck in the world.  All right.  Yes, sir.  If you throw out one more cliche, I'm going to smash my own face into the console.  Bird in the hand.  It's worth two in the bush.  Fuel in the fire.  All right, Jack.  Fuel in the fire.  Get home safe, Jack.  One more from Jeff in Philly. 
[01:07:00]  Jeff listening on WYSP.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I just want to cheer you up, man.  We love you here in Philly.  And we got you back all the way.  Thanks.  Want some Philly representation then in our courtroom.  I'm glad it's sharing because I think a lot of guys are going through this crap.  That's it.  That's what it is.  You know, a lot of people, too, you could just sit there and just, well, I don't want to say this or that or the other thing.  All I'm saying is what happened.  If I'm saying anything that I could be sued for, well, then it's a surprise to me. 
[01:07:30]  Because, like I said, anything I've said, there are 20 people that could back up everything I'm saying.  That's our marriage.  In my opinion, I'll even say, at that point that I mentioned earlier, when she was inviting other women into our marriage, that's when I was like, all right, there's an issue.  And that was three or so years into our marriage. 
[01:08:00]  Please, please, enough.  Don't come off like the poor little victim in your deposition.  Let's go to Diana in California.  Diana.  Hey, Anthony, you're doing the right thing.  That's the problem.  You were too nice to her.  And she knew you would not go to court.  And she knew you would pay her.  Now you need to fucking take her.  Oh, she's a cop.  Oh, I'm on the radio, sorry.  Oops.  It's okay.  Go ahead.  Oops.  She deserves it.  And isn't he friends with Howard Stern? 
[01:08:30]  Isn't that like his friend?  Well, Dominic Barber, it's known.  Yeah, he's good friends with Howard Stern.  Why don't you send some chick over there to fucking seduce her?  Oh, sorry.  You are a potty mouth girl.  You are just a filthy potty mouth.  I love this.  She's saying it, though.  She's saying she's very angry.  She's on your side, Anthony.  She's angry.  It answers it up for the rest of us girls.  Because the same thing happened to my boyfriend with his wife.  He just let things go.  It was easier to just, you know, pay it and get her, you know, so she would leave. 
[01:09:00]  And she took advantage of him.  Yeah, that's what happens.  That's what happens.  Well, let him bring it on this time.  You should have someone go down and seduce him.  And then he'll be on their side.  I just can't wait for the day we get the news that Dominic Barber died of an effing heart attack.  That bloated mess.  Or have that killed by a drunk driver.  That's even better.  That would be nice.  That could have been avoided.  Well, don't do that.  Just have some who to go down there and take care of him. 
[01:09:30]  All right, Diana.  I got you, potty mouth.  All right, we got to take a break.  It's the OB and Anthony Show.  Hit it.  It's the OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Virus.  Oh, I got heartburn.  Does anybody have any acid reflux pills?  All right, I'm going to be in Cleveland at the Cleveland Improv.  Last time I played the Cleveland Improv, I got AIDS in the condo.  So hopefully they'll be able to hotel.  That is March 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, and 1st. 
[01:10:00]  Jesus Christ.  What am I filming an independent film?  Why am I there so many days?  What is that?  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday?  Oh, God.  But anyways, the number for the Cleveland Improv, I'm going to be there for a month, apparently,  is 216-696-4677.  Again, that is 216-696-4677.  Make sure you guys come down.  Pass the word. 
[01:10:30]  Can you tell I have a cold sore on my tongue?  I'm talking like a fucking retard.  My, I'm kidding about the cold sore.  Don't owe me.  Don't you know, don't you know, if you change,  it means you're going your way.  If you hold on for one more day.  If you hold on for one more day,  things will go your way.  Ah, good morning. 
[01:11:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Why?  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We got MacBooks to give away this week, Anthony.  The new fine MacBook.  Yes.  We're doing MacBook karaoke.  It was such a hit last time.  We wound up getting a hit song out of it.  It's one that gets stuck in everyone's head.  I always saw the swings. 
[01:11:30]  Uh, all right, yeah.  We'll do the hook.  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding without understanding.  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong.  But where's where you belong?  I actually, I had to get my girlfriend a MacBook for her birthday because you slipped up. 
[01:12:00]  Opie got his girlfriend a MacBook for Christmas and then we were talking at this gig I was  doing on New Year's Eve and we were talking Christmas and you said to my girl, like, yeah,  well, my girl got the same thing you did.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I swear I bought one and I just wound up keeping it.  Like, I got her something else because I'm just a greedy ass.  I kept it myself.  So he's like, did you get her? 
[01:12:30]  I'm like, uh, no, I got her this.  And she's like, no, he didn't get me a computer.  So I had to get her for her birthday and go, no, no, he misunderstood.  Oh, no.  Getting a double M really irritated me.  I cost you a couple grand.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's hilarious.  No, it wasn't that bad.  No, no, no.  No, actually it wasn't.  It was a lot less than that.  Well, here's the deal.  We got three finalists for today and one of these people will win a MacBook.  Yes.  It's, well, let's get right into it.  A MacBook.  One of our finalists comes from Philly.  We got one from Philly and two from New York today. 
[01:13:00]  So this is Christina representing Philly.  Philly, what song are we going to hear?  Take My Breath Away.  Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game  On this and this ocean finally love is no, no shame  Turning and returning to some secret place inside 
[01:13:30]  Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say  Take My Breath Away  I must feel like I'm watching Top Gun.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[01:14:00]  Take My Breath Away  Well, there you go, Philly.  Christina representing you guys today.  Very good voice.  That's a lovely song, isn't it?  I don't know what makes a good voice.  Is that a good voice?  That's a pretty good voice.  I wasn't irritated, so I guess it's a good voice.  Yeah, which absolutely means she has no chance at winning.  Well, you never know.  It sounded too good.  I don't want people to think that.  I know, I know.  Because we might just throw it at someone that just has an unbelievable voice.  You never know.  The next one is Jason representing all of New York with I Will Do Anything For Love. 
[01:14:30]  Some days I pray for silence  Some days I pray for soul  Some days I will pray to the god of sex syndrome than rock and roll  Maybe I'm lonely and that's all I'm qualified to be  There's just one and only  The one and only promise I can keep  As long as the wheels are turning 
[01:15:00]  As long as the fires are burning  As long as your prayers are coming true  I should win a Commodore 64  Ouch!  I don't know.  What are you thinking, Jason?  He was just a flat ass.  I think that meatloaf rendition needs a little spice to it. 
[01:15:30]  Christina is still in the lead from Philly.  Will Christina win the MacBook?  We got one left.  Ariana from New York as well.  She came up with this for the MacBook today.  And I will always love you  Oh my God, a little behind.  Jesus.  I will always love you  I will always love you 
[01:16:00]  That's terrible. I'm sorry. 
[01:16:30]  Congratulations to Ariana from New York  Come on!  Why couldn't she even get a karaoke version?  She had to sing along with the actual track.  No, what do you want to do?  It's either Christina from Philly with the very good voice  Or Ariana just making a mockery of Whitney Houston  Was she trying to make a mockery or did she just stink? 
[01:17:00]  She just stinked.  I think she really stinks.  She was really trying.  Well, my votes were Ariana.  Ant, it's to you.  You know, just to break this whole thing of people thinking  we're only going to give it to...  Wait, wait.  Before you say that.  Yeah.  I will always love you  I will always love you 
[01:17:30]  I will always love you  What is going on there?  You  Oh, Bert from Philly.  That's so awful.  I'm exhausted now.  I will always love you  Ding, ding, ding.  We have a winner.  What?  Where is she from?  New York. 
[01:18:00]  Ken and Chris, I'd rather pay Anthony's ex-wife for another two years  than listen to Ariana again.  All right.  Here's what I'm thinking.  All right.  You know how American Idol gets its winner at the end of the season?  Yeah.  But a lot of times the person in second place becomes more popular.  Yeah.  Actually, I would like to actually give the win  to the girl that was really kind of singing 
[01:18:30]  give her the MacBook  but I think this other girl that you're on here  what's her name?  Ariana?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's going to go far with this show.  She's going to be the one that's invited down.  She sings it live.  Like the other girl will win  and you know, you might hear about her every so often  but  I see this girl showing up here in the studio to perform.  I always love you 
[01:19:00]  Oh my God!  I always love you  Dude, someone is pointing out that she's a full second behind.  They figured it out.  Jimmy, what do you think?  Jimmy, what do you think?  It's up to you.  I say Ariana  Anthony says Christina  What do you think, Jimmy?  Jason  Oh wow. 
[01:19:30]  Oh my God.  Now we're in a  Now we're in some kind of a problem.  I don't know  We all agree that Jason sucked, right?  Ariana, to be honest, I enjoyed more.  What did you say?  I enjoyed Ariana more.  Hey dog!  Yeah.  Someone is saying a bit pitchy in spots.  Yeah, yo dog, you were a little pitchy.  You were a little behind the lyrics.  It's funny if you look at apartment buildings  and you just see dogs throwing themselves out the windows  with their heads tilted.  Steven from Bayshore is calling her scary, Anna. 
[01:20:00]  We'll always love you  We'll always love you  You like Huey Lewis on the news?  We'll always love you  That's tough.  Wow.  Because I like her. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, believe me.  Because that's spunk and pizzazz.  Don't get me wrong.  I love that rendition.  This is very serious  because it is a MacBook.  We're not talking about a cute t-shirt  and bumper sticker here.  So why don't we  Here's Christina again  in all fairness  because we played Ariana a lot.  All right.  It's between Ariana  and Christine from Philly  just in case.  Here's Christina again  or just a piece.  Watching every motion  In my foolish lover's game  On this endless ocean 
[01:21:00]  Finally love is no, no shame  Turning and returning  To some secret place inside  Watching in slow motion  As you turn around  And say  Take my breath away 
[01:21:30]  Take my breath away  Like  The thing that's good about her  is she's  She'll  Here's the thing  I like the fact  that she kind of stuck  with the rules more  like she did a pure karaoke version  Yeah  Whereas the other chick  just kind of  My only problem with the other girl  is that she sang  with the song  With the song  That kind of makes it fun though 
[01:22:00]  It  Oh, believe me  It's fun  Her version is fun  But I just think  the other girl  did a pretty good job  with that song  All right.  I say Ariana  And says Christina  from Philly  So Jimmy, it's up to you  I'm going to have to go  with the Philly girl  But  Can we get a submission  from that Ariana girl  and do it the way  it's supposed to be done  like without  singing with Whitney Houston  in the background  Yeah  That's the only thing  that wrecked it for me  is that this girl  kind of stuck with it  and we'll get more use  out of the actual computer 
[01:22:30]  because she actually  probably is someone  that really does sing  and would use it  for the right  Well, Flying Standby writes  Ariana's version  sounds like Whitney Houston  now  Yeah  Bobby Brown was  kidney punching  Let's say hi to Ariana  from New York  Ariana  Oh  Oh, my phone's ringing  Hold on, let me walk away  Of course it's ringing  Of course it is  You're on the radio  You're on the radio  right now  They're talking about you  I know 
[01:23:00]  My phone's totally ringing  right now  I've got to run away  from it  Run away from it  Run away  I've got to run away  from it  Wow  This one is as dumb  as they come  I love it  Oh, run away  Yeah, we can't give  dummies MacBooks  Now  She'll eat it  Ariana  Yes, sir  Why  How old are you?  I'm 30 years old  30 years old  I'm going to buy  American Idol  You what?  I don't qualify  for American Idol  No, no  But you qualify  for this program 
[01:23:30]  And now  Why did you sing  the song over  the original song  instead of getting  like a karaoke version?  I don't know much  about computers  My brother's the expert  and that's the way  he recorded me  Uh-huh  And was he laughing  when he recorded it?  My brother  I thought he  crapped in his pants  He was crying so hard  He was crying  I actually think  I'm a good singer  Oh, you do?  Yeah  Because you were  doing all those  little runs and stuff  with Whitney  Hey, I think I'm 
[01:24:00]  as good as Whitney  sometimes  but I guess the  alcohol wasn't  strong enough  It's pretty close  I've got to be  honest with you  Yes  Eli Whitney  Maybe I should  make some cotton  instead  Oh, wow  She's smart  Yeah  Well, Jimmy  has decided  that you do not  win the match  But again  mainly  because I enjoyed  to be honest with you  The other girls  are better singers  I enjoyed your version more  I would rather hear  your version in a replay  Yeah, yeah  Could you redo it though  where you're not singing 
[01:24:30]  over Whitney Houston  because then it's like  you can't really tell  And Jimmy, you know  the rules too, right?  What?  It's not necessarily  the best singer  Oh, no, I know  It's the one that  just kind of got you  thinking or reacting  the most  But she  It's up to you  so I've got to  go by your rules  I just wish there was  Well, we don't want  people out there  thinking we're looking  for bad singers  or really good singers  It's really  On a daily basis  it's really up to us  the one that got  the best reaction  from the gang  Now, would you be willing  to maybe come down here  and sing the song live?  I'd come in  but I really, really 
[01:25:00]  want to win a MacBook  It's for my future sister  and she needs it  to do graphics and stuff  It wasn't even for me  I just wanted it for her  Well, you really want  the MacBook, huh?  Oh, yes, very much  It would be a great  wedding present for her  She's getting married  in two months  to my brother  Oh, that's nice  And that would be  a very nice wedding gift, right?  No, I'd give her  something else  But you really  want the MacBook  I think we've got  a very easy decision here  Ariana?  Yes?  You do not win  the MacBook  So long  Oh, that's right 
[01:25:30]  Oh, that's right  For a wedding gift  why don't you give her  a sister-in-law  that can sing  Yeah  Like that  Hey, Christina  She's listening  from Philly  listening on WYSP  Congratulations  You just won  the unbelievable  new MacBook  Create your own  music, movies, websites  whatever  and bring it  wherever you go  Head to the Apple Store  or Apple.com  to check it out  We'll have more  MacBook Karaoke  tomorrow  on the Opie and Anthony Show  Yes  Hey, you know  we started off nice though  That was good  I like that  Can we bring in  Master Poe 
[01:26:00]  Speaking of karaoke  Everyone's ranting  and raving  about Master Poe  doing karaoke  Yeah  at my bro's restaurant  over the weekend  Oh, he's a good singer  Absolutely getting  some great reviews  as we wait for Master Poe  to enter the studio  and get set up  Get another listen  Another listen to Ariana  who came in second place today  in MacBook Karaoke  It's wonderful  My favorite spot 
[01:26:30]  right there  I will always love you  I will always love you  I will always love you 
[01:27:00]  Like it's like  a flying saucer  I'm kind of second-guessing  myself now  He's rolling on me  a little bit  See  No, I think  we can definitely  get her in here though  I think we made a mistake today  I don't want to be  wishy-worshy  No  I think we made a mistake  No, I think we gotta keep  we gotta keep  the people guessing  Alright  There will always be  awful submissions  You know what'll happen?  If we give  only those people 
[01:27:30]  prizes  everybody's just gonna  send in  goofs of crap  where we need  people that really  are serious  and think  they sound good  like she thinks  she really sounded good  That's why  that's so good  If we get people  that just start  singing badly  thinking they're gonna win  then there's problems  so we show them  by giving it to a girl  that can sing  Alright, Christina  Hi guys  Congratulations  You won the MacBook  Thank you  Are you a pro? 
[01:28:00]  No, actually I'm not  I've been singing  since I was about two  but I never went pro  I did the whole  shitty audition  for American Idol  but  I just, you know  I've always been passionate  about my singing  and I said  you know, my fiancee  which, you know  Anthony  I'll talk a few times  was like  you know what?  Do it  She's a fun gal  She is a fun gal  Listen to her  She is a fun gal  And do you do karaoke a lot?  Yeah, I am a karaoke whore 
[01:28:30]  Whoa!  We got a live one  on the phones  Why'd you pick that song  to sing?  I'm sorry  What about that?  Why'd you pick that song?  It's one of my favorites  I love Berlin  I'm a big new  New and Anthony  I'm a big 80s singer  I'm a big new wave  Are you?  Yes  Where do you sing karaoke  in Philly?  I do General Grants  I do a numerous place  So I was karaoke host  myself for a couple years 
[01:29:00]  Oh  Karaoke host  I was supposed to attend  on Saturday night  but unfortunately  the weather permitted us  to do so  Oh, that's a shame  She laughs after everything  Yeah  It's fun, I like her  You got a nice laugh there  Thank you  She'd be great as a cop  going to the door  Hi, your kids are dead  So you won the MacBook  What are you going to do  with the MacBook there, Christina?  What am I going to do  with the MacBook?  I am going to  Thank you  No one cares 
[01:29:30]  Can I say  I almost had a wonderful experience  because the MacBooks have these  they have like a video feature  where you can iChat  and I had one of our former  winners  contacted me  we were just chit-chatting  and I was trying to get her  to appear naked  and she wouldn't  I am  I'm loving it  and just chit-chatting  about the computer  and I just kept  I kept like segueing  into like the video feature 
[01:30:00]  Hey, the video feature  is great  Yeah, no, it was good  LOL  So, you can look at me  if you want to  Camera included  Yeah, it's unbelievable  I know, I'm a pig  But she wouldn't go for it  All right  We got Master Poe in studio  Master Poe  Hi, Poe  Hey, guys  One of our professional killers  that protects us, I guess  Right, Poe?  Every day  Every day  Every day  Congratulations  Every day, punk  We had karaoke  at FH Riley's 
[01:30:30]  over the weekend  Yes  Did you have a good time?  I had a wonderful time  And everyone's saying  ranting and raving  about you doing Prince  I didn't know that  What song?  He did a couple  Purple Rain  Well, Purple Rain  and When Doves Cry  When Doves Cry  I think people liked  When Doves Cry  a little better  Yeah  Oh, cool  Yeah  They did?  Yeah  I didn't know I did it  I thought it was  I thought it needed help  No, I didn't need any help  I mean, you get, you know  raves when you sing  at FH  You used to sing some duets 
[01:31:00]  with Anthony's sister, Dawn  Sure  Yes, absolutely  And now you've decided  to become a solo artist  as far as the karaoke goes  at FH, right?  Kicked Anne's sister  out of the band?  No, no  I wouldn't do that  Dawn went solo, too  Yeah  They broke up  as far as a singing duo  How many people  kind of punched it lightly  and said  Hey, Paul, FH  you know what it means  I think everyone did  It may have been an incident  in the back park a lot  so FH might mean  something else  What's it mean? 
[01:31:30]  I haven't been there  for karaoke  Something with F  F here  Yeah, that was F here, Riley's  What?  It was  Maybe you were gone  No, I was  I don't know what happened  What happened?  There may have been  something that happened  in a car out back  one fine evening  at FH Riley's  Yeah, I don't even  Or maybe not  We really don't know  because I wasn't there  How are you walking away, Paul?  Outside FH Riley's  In the back  there's a parking lot  A dark parking lot  And something might have  been a rocket  I don't know 
[01:32:00]  I wasn't there  I can't say  Yeah, we don't know  whether I saw anything or not  Oh, alright  But then someone nicknamed  the joint F here  Yeah  Riley's  What's the F stand for?  Can't say  So, Poe  We invite you in  to sing  When Doves Cry  we decided?  Yes  When Doves Cry  by Prince  for everybody  because you did such a great job  at FH Riley's  Kind of putting you on the spot  I understand it's early in the morning  but people were ranting  and raving about you 
[01:32:30]  Alright  You got performance of the night  I'll do the best I can  but I don't remember all the words  Do you have the words in front of you?  No, I don't  We didn't  We should have printed those out  How long is it going to take  to get lyrics?  30 seconds  30 seconds  30 seconds  30 seconds  I'm screaming  If he  Let me look  I'm actually checking the time on this  Don't you have to print it up too though?  30 seconds  Can you remember some of the lyrics?  Can you start without them?  I mean  Yes  Do you remember some of them?  Let them start without them  That'd be fine  It'll come to you  It'll come to you  Because that's what it is with a song  I can't say it  We can start the song  And then by the time 
[01:33:00]  You get a little confused  They'll have the lyrics in front of you?  Yes  How's that sound?  Alright  Why don't we start up the music there for Poe  And we'll get Poe singing a little bit  As we go to break  Oh by the way  Chris Hansen is going to be up next  Yeah  And there's the lyrics  30 seconds later  Wow  Alright  Here you go Poe  It was exactly 30 seconds  What's that?  I'm stunned  We should  Alright here we go  And Poe  You can hear the music?  Yes  Yes I can  Alright  There's the music  We can all hear it 
[01:33:30]  And ladies and gentlemen  It's Master Poe  Doing Prince  Dig if you will 
[01:34:00]  My picture  If you and I engaged in a kiss  To swear to your body covers me  Can you my darling  Can you picture  Dream if you dance in a courtyard  And oceans and violets in bloom  Animals strike  Curie exposes  They feel the heat  The heat between me and you 
[01:34:30]  Alone in the world is so cold  Maybe I'm just too demanding  Maybe I'm just like my father  Too bold  Maybe I'm just like my mother  She's never satisfied  Why do we scream at each other?  This is what it sounds like  When doves cry 
[01:35:00]  Touch if you will  My stomach  Feel how it trembles inside  You got the butterflies all tied up  Don't let me chase you  Even doves that pride 
[01:35:30]  Alone in the world is so cold  Maybe I'm just too demanding  Maybe I'm just like my father  Too bold  Maybe I'm just like my mother  She's never satisfied  Why do we scream at each other?  This is what it sounds like 
[01:36:00]  When doves cry  How can you just leave me standing?  Alone in the world is so cold  Maybe I'm just too demanding  Maybe I'm just like my father 
[01:36:30]  Too bold  Maybe I'm just like my mother  She's never satisfied  Why do we scream at each other?  This is what it sounds like  When doves cry  When doves cry  Who does cry  Master Poe, everyone  Getting rave reviews  On the instant feedback 
[01:37:00]  Oh, yeah  That's good, Poe  That's good  Good job  Nice  Thanks, guys  Very, very good  See?  That's why you were getting  High marks at FH Riley's  Over the weekend  There you go  When we get back  We got Chris Hansen  Joining the program  He has a book  With all these predator things  Catch a predator  Now there's a book out  Yep  I think it's like  Protecting your kids  From unlined enemies  Already in your home  Right  Ah  Hey, Poe  Thumbs up  Thank you, Ope 
[01:37:30]  It was good, right?

No, I'm not kidding  There's some people that just don't get it  I guess we gotta explain everything  The point was that it would sound really bad 
[01:39:30]  Without the music behind it  All right, our phone number  1-866-313-FREE  In studio, Chris Hansen  Yeah  He walks in  I gotta be honest with you  I'm like, oh my god, we're all in trouble  Yeah, he's become kind of that guy  That walks in somewhere  And you don't want to see  It used to be  Yeah, so reported from  I guess 60 Minutes  Would be the guy that would walk in  And you'd go, oh boy  Mike Wallace  Now you're the guy  It's kind of like, oh no, what did I do?  Hey, give me a mic  Oh boy  Jesus, Opie  I got the mics on 
[01:40:00]  Hello?  Nope  Try that one  That one more  There you go  Yeah, I know  Every time I walk into a place  People kind of go the other way  Yeah  Yeah, it's like, I don't want to  What did I do?  I can't  Well, imagine being one of my kids  When something happens  I say, come on in here  And have a seat over there  Yeah, why don't you have a seat over there?  It really is  I've noticed a lot of these guys  Now, to catch a predator  Is just huge  I mean, it's got to be very high rated  At this point  Everyone knows about it  If you had asked me 
[01:40:30]  When we got this started  If we'd still be doing it  I wouldn't have believed it  I mean, I figured we'd do it  Two or three times  And we'd end up  You know, with me just pacing the kitchen  And looking like the Maytag repairman  With nothing to do  But in fact, that's not what's happened  And we get guys who keep coming  We get guys who talk about the show  In the chat  Yeah, yeah  And show up anyway  And show up anyway  Oh my gosh  I think the attraction to it  That dumb sometimes  It's so rare that you get to catch somebody 
[01:41:00]  In the act of committing a crime  That it's fascinating to watch  Especially when you realize  What they're doing  And who these people are  It's such a cross-section of humanity  We've seen, you know  A Homeland Security agent  We've had doctors  We've had teachers  We've had people from all walks of life  Yeah  In the last investigation  We had a police officer  Who showed up  This guy had a .38 caliber gun in his pocket  And in his car had an assault rifle 
[01:41:30]  A shotgun  Another handgun  Hundreds of rounds of ammunition  Wow  And videotape equipment  Oh  So when you walked in the door  And you walked out  What did he do?  Well, this was a unique situation  And perhaps fortunate for us  Because we had actually quit for the night  We had been working very late the night before  The decoys had been chatting with this guy  He was several hours late  And they said, this guy's not coming  So of course we leave  We go to the hotel  And the minute we walk into the hotel 
[01:42:00]  Cell phones are ringing  And oh my god  And so he had called the decoy from a payphone  And said, you know, I'm ten minutes out  So we scramble  And the best thing that we could do  Was just get crews out  To where the police stopped at a traffic stop  And so there was no incident  But yeah, it worries you to think  What might have happened  Yeah, what might have happened  You come strolling out  Could you take a seat right down there  And he starts opening fire on you  Are you nervous about things like that?  I mean  You know, we have a very detailed  And strict security protocol  That we go through 
[01:42:30]  And I'm comfortable based on that  And we adjust it for each individual house  And each area  Metal detectors built into the door jam  We pretty much know, you know, what's coming  I mean, remember  We've had the benefit of reading the entire chat log  Right  You know, by the time it gets there  So if the guy talks about guns or violence  Or, you know, we'll change up a little bit  So we'll protect ourselves  Yeah, I saw one just recently with the doctor  That guy 
[01:43:00]  Obviously, yeah, his life destroyed  In a split second  This guy comes in  And again, I've read the chat  So I pretty much know where his head's at  And the way he walks in  And I'm watching on the monitor  He strikes me as the kind of guy  Who's probably going to stay in chat  And because of who he is  It's probably going to be a very interesting interview  So he comes in  And the decoy says  Have a seat over there  Pour yourself a beverage  And I'm going to go change my swimsuit 
[01:43:30]  Some kind of frozen concoction in a blender  And as you know  Sometimes with frozen concoctions and blenders  Once they get in the pitcher  They freeze up  And it comes out in a big chunk  He's a little nervous anyway  So he goes to pour this thing  And it comes out  But one thing, blah  He just looks like a big dope  He pours it out  It spills everywhere  It spills everywhere  So now he's going to try  And clean up his mess  And still have this conversation  With the decoy  Who's allegedly changing into a swimsuit  Around on the other side  So he goes to get a towel  And as he does  He comes so close to where we're set up 
[01:44:00]  That he sees the sound man  Mission control he sees back there  So they get eye contact  And so now he's gone  Ready to go  Yeah  So he's out there  He's gone  The next thing you know  He's on the phone  Telling his wife to bring $30,000  But not the kids  Yeah  The Sonoma County  Don't bring the kids  It's something I shouldn't have done  But I did it  And  But when the cops come for him  He just knows  You could see him  He goes  No  Oh God  Well this cat did not just  Go on for 15 minutes  I mean he had been at this for days 
[01:44:30]  And it was very detailed  And very explicit  Yeah  Chris speaking of that  We talk about the show all the time here  We want you guys to let one guy go  As a goof  Just one guy  Like you know  He's convinced his life is destroyed  Or the cops are going to go after him  And the cops are outside waiting  But you just kind of let them walk away  Like he wins the lotto  Yeah  Just one guy  Apparently the first couple of shows  I guess you did let them go  Well we didn't have a situation  In the first couple of shows  Where police were doing a parallel investigation  We were just doing our story 
[01:45:00]  And in the first one  Oh so you did have people leave  We did have people leave  Now some of those guys were prosecuted  Right  But you know  We were kind of figuring this thing out  As we went along  In the first couple of investigations  We were in Long Island for the first one  So that's got to really frustrate you guys  Because you're like  Wow we caught a creep here  But we can't do anything  And he is going to just walk away  See we said that as a goof  But in your position  That's got to be really frustrating  Well that's why  When Perverted Justice  The online watchdog group  Was approached by the Riverside County  Sheriff's Department 
[01:45:30]  To have a parallel investigation  We thought that would be  Worthwhile exploring  Difficult  Because you want  To have a separation  From journalism and law enforcement  We don't want to be  A tool of law enforcement  And they don't want to be  You know  An arm of journalism  But we were able to work it out  So we could do our investigation  We get our copy of the chat logs  From Perverted Justice  Law enforcement gets theirs  We do our thing  And afterwards  The police do theirs  Yeah there kind of is  A separation there  It's almost  It's very noticeable 
[01:46:00]  As a matter of fact  You do  You guys are doing  What you do  And then a barrier  Is crossed  And he is now  In the hands of law enforcement  Pretty much how it works  You know  We have total control  Over our part of it  And the police  And the DA's office  Has control over its part of it  What is a pedophile thinking though  They've discussed your show  In the chat log  Because they're all aware  Of the show I'm sure  When you walk in  And then you don't see  The person you're supposed to see  And they're like  I'm getting a drink  It's like  Why would you keep going  In the house  Why don't you just 
[01:46:30]  Turn around and leave  I mean you're already caught  But why don't  Some do  But I think a couple things happen  One  These guys  Many of them  Develop addictions  And compulsions  On the internet  To the point  Where the only thing  That will satisfy them  Is this face to face meeting  With their dream date  And so they  They blur this line  Between fantasy and reality  And they justify it  And they show up  And they're there  And the other thing  I think happens is  A lot of these guys  Just figure  It's not going to happen to me  Dateline can't be everywhere  Law enforcement 
[01:47:00]  Can't be everywhere  And the reality is  They're right  They're right  I mean  The odds are overwhelmingly  In their favor  Are you amazed  At how many pedophiles  Are out there  It brought to everyone's attention  I had no idea  It was an epidemic like this  And now every day  We talk about  Every day  You look at the papers  There's another  One of these creeps  Being arrested for something  I think  That  It breaks down  Into three categories  Based on our experience  You've got the  Young guys  22  23  Who are opportunists 
[01:47:30]  I'm not  Saying that it's okay  To do what they do  It's illegal  And they shouldn't be doing it  But in their mind  They don't see anything wrong  With setting up a date online  With a 13 or 14 year old girl  Who may be sexually active anyway  The other group  Are the hardcore  Heavy hitters  These guys would be in the park  Or the playground  Or the movie theaters  They'd be doing this anyway  And there's this group  In the middle  Who without the internet  Wouldn't be engaging  In this sort of activity  These are guys  Who got  You know  Hooked into the porn sites  You know  Into the chat rooms  And they've really developed  Well you really think 
[01:48:00]  That they wouldn't even  Be doing this  If it wasn't for the internet  I think  I think of the third  Of the guys  Who show up  In our investigations  Wow  I think so  That's a bold statement  It's addictive  It's 24 hours a day  Seven days a week  And remember  There's a difference  Between  The classic definition  Of a pedophile  And some of the people  We see  Right  We refer to them  As predators  Or potential predators  Pedophile has a very  Distinct definition  Some of the guys  We see meet that definition  Some don't  There are guys  That are just sadists  And hurt children  And it's got to be 
[01:48:30]  Very satisfying  When you catch  One of these animals  But are there any guys  That have walked in  That you've actually  Believed  Whether they get arrested  Or not  That you've actually  Go you know what  This guy I believe  Probably was a first timer  Anything that you actually  Believed  I think so  I mean  Almost everybody  Who comes in  Says it's their first time  And I'm pretty sure  Not all of them  Are told  But I think  There are a handful  Who have come in  It was their first time  And a couple guys  For instance  We had a situation  In Long Beach, California  Where a guy  Had been online  Chatting with the decoy  And he sends his 
[01:49:00]  15 year old cousin  In there  To check it out  Now this poor kid  Didn't have a clue  You know  He walks in  And I'm talking to him  All of a sudden  And he said  Well my cousin  And he really didn't  I mean they threw him  Under the bus  To see if everything  Was okay  And he  You know  He wasn't prosecuted  And you know  He was fine  So we  Did they get the cousin?  They did  Do you find yourself  Now I know  A lot of people  Especially cops  That have to do work  Like this  They get desensitized  To a lot of things  Do you find yourself  Because you have to  Paw through so much  Of this  You know  Smut  Do you find yourself 
[01:49:30]  Getting desensitized  A bit?  Not really  What I see is  That a lot of these  Chats follow the same  Pattern  You know  It's the same  Not that original  Yeah what's going on  How are you  Oh you're way too young  For me  And all of a sudden  Well you know  Have you ever thought  Of older men  Do you do this  Do you do that  Do the other thing  But you know  I need to know  What this guy has said  And take the nuance  So I can do an interview  With the guy  You know  And I'm fortunate too  Because I get to do  Other stories  So  Right  I mean  This one gets 
[01:50:00]  An enormous amount  Of attention  And it's really  Really important  But I do get to do  Other stuff  You're doing other stuff  My favorites are  When you actually  Have the photos  Of the guys  A little pixelation  And it's like  You sent this photo  And the guy's just like  Yeah that's me  What can you say  At that point  It's so embarrassing  Who knew that so many people  Were sending photos like this  Back and forth  I have no clue  I didn't know that so many people  Were hooking up  Much less having these  Kind of conversations  Yeah legitimately hooking up  Yeah there's things going on 
[01:50:30]  Yeah I mean who knew  I didn't  I don't know  I go to you know  Various news websites  We did the first one of these  And I was stuck in traffic  Trying to get over  The Throgs Neck Bridge  Wondering gosh  Should I just waste  Tens of thousands of dollars  Of NBC's money  The producer gets on the phone  And says  I got two guys  You do here in 40 minutes  Get here  And from then on  It just was  You know guys  Are running into each other  Amazing  So you have caught  A lot of people  And it's obviously  A great thing  You're catching pedophiles  And I know it's discouraging people 
[01:51:00]  Because a lot of people  Probably don't do it  Because they don't want to get busted  What kind of negative reaction  There has to be somebody  Complaining about it  Yeah  There are people  Who think  Okay you should have done it  Two or three times  And you made your point  There are people  For instance in Texas  Who were critical  Because they didn't want us  Doing this investigation  In their neighborhood  I would argue that  We made that the safest neighborhood  In Texas that weekend  Yeah  I would argue that  We have a lot of security 
[01:51:30]  And precautions in place  So everything was safe  I would argue that  We are covering a continuing story  And we don't do just one story  On the war on terror  Or the war in Iraq  Or the economy  Or the fuel efficiency  In vehicles  We're not going to do just one story  On this issue either  Yeah this isn't going away  It's not something that's  Okay it's fixed  We can't do a story on it anymore  I mean what we've done  Is you know  Take the same hidden camera  Techniques that we used  In Cambodia  For child sex tourism 
[01:52:00]  Or in India  For child slave labor  In the silk business  And we turned it towards  You know the issue  Of computer predators  What do you think about people  That take a lot of trips  To Thailand  Well it depends  What they're doing  Well let's  We all know  What they're doing  They'll come up with  Other reasons why  They have to be there  But  There's a show  That's on before us here  You might want to give them a call  You might want to  Yeah give them a call  Is that right  One of the hosts  Seems to  He has been on the  Terrorist watch list  Because he flies so much 
[01:52:30]  To Thailand  And it's never business  It's always pleasure  And  I don't know  Unless you're  Selling rubber dog do  And need to buy it  In bulk  I really see no  Reason to go there  Except for the  Child  Sex industry  And we asked the question  Like  Why do you go to Thailand  And it just  We're doing our own  It's always very vague  Yeah we're doing our own  Investigation  It's like  They like the beaches  Stop  There's beaches all over the world  You can go there  Yeah what do you do  I have to go there on business  Then you ask a little more 
[01:53:00]  And it's just so vague  Like they never had to go over there  For that even  Well you know  I'm stationed over there  I guess is a good reason  But besides that  I don't know  There's a lot of that activity  Over there  We do  You know  Past investigations  Yeah you've done  In Cambodia right  Yeah  We're over there  And that  You know  It's rampant  In some of these  Yeah  You also just got done  In Africa  We just got back  From working on  An upcoming story  On credit card fraud  And identity theft  And we essentially  Infiltrate a syndicate  And work back 
[01:53:30]  At a level  And through Europe  And into Africa  And I'll tell you a great story  We were talking to somebody  Who didn't know  That they were on  Hidden cameras  Part of this investigation  And essentially  We wire these locations  Like a predator house  And I was  We had Hanson Discount Electronics  And CH Delivery  And so we  Through every part of this  We get there  And what happens  Is a lot of these guys  Unwittingly get sucked  Into these sweetheart scams  And the people are involved  In the buying electronics  Or stolen credit cards  But they take delivery  Here in the United States 
[01:54:00]  And reship it  So we tell this guy  To come in  And he's got to  Pick up his packages  And I'm sitting there  In a fleece  And a Detroit Tigers  Ball cap on  And he's going on  I said  Where did you meet this girl  You're in business with  He said well  In a chat room  He leans over and says  But you know  You've got to be careful  I said  It's all on him  He says  Because that show  Dateline will bust you  If you're talking  To the young girls  He says  Have you seen the show  I said  Why yes I have  Did you see the one 
[01:54:30]  Last week  Where the guy walks in  For the second time  I said  I saw that  I said  Did you see the one  Where the guy walked in naked  And he goes  Yeah that's amazing  And the guys are  Killing themselves  In the back  Oh I bet  And I'm saying  You know that  Chris Hansen's  Are pretty sharp  I'd be pushing it  Just a hair too far  Oh man  What are the odds  Was he angry at you  When he finally realized  And you're like  Yes for a picture  In a following  In a following meeting  We said look  We think you're being scammed  We need you to help us  And he did  And that's how we got  To the next level 
[01:55:00]  Of the next level  Do you try to set up  The older women  I know that's not  As prevalent  As the older creeps  But you ever get women  Coming into the house  Looking for sex  With the young boys  We have never seen  That in our investigation  We profile a case  In the book  Where a woman  Was involved  In this sort of activity  And caught  But generally  In our experience  And the experts  We talk to  Have said that  When it comes to  Female predators  They certainly exist  We've seen the  High profile cases  Of teachers and students  But they like to know  Their target 
[01:55:30]  Whereas a male predator  Is much more comfortable  With the anonymity  That's provided  On the internet  Yeah it almost seems  Like the women  It's a relationship  They're going for  In some way  It's more than  Just a sexual encounter  But do you see  A complete double standard  With the way  Deborah Lafayette  Was handled  And the way  A male predator  Would be handled  In the same situation  I don't know  I know people  Have made that criticism  And that maybe  She got a break  Because she's 
[01:56:00]  An attractive  Woman  And I'm sure  A lot more  Went into it  Than that  I'm sure  They look at  What are the chances  Of her re-offending  What treatment  What punishment  You know  That sort of  But I don't even think  That would be looked into  If she was on the other foot  And it was a guy  Teacher  A young female student  I don't think  They would even look  At the fact that  Well  Would he do it again  Will it  I believe there would be  Some jail time  There at least  I think there's  A double standard  There  I think there is  Hey we got a question 
[01:56:30]  Coming in from Jeff  From Richfield  Jeff  You're on with Chris Hansen  Hey how's it going  I'm just wondering  What are you guys  Putting that lemonade  To get those guys  To talk so much  I can't believe  That they admit  To so much on the air  Are you surprised  About that a lot  That they do talk  I think a couple  I think a couple things  Happened  One  And we've seen this  Some of these guys  Are sort of relieved  I mean  They want to get  Off their chest  They want to get  Off their chest  We've had some  Of these interviews  Turn into virtual  Therapy sessions  You know  Guys going back  I've had a 10 year  Problem with this 
[01:57:00]  I got older  But the people  I'm chatting with  Have not  And you know  They're young  And as bad  As it all is  I think they know  That they're going  To finally get some help  In some of these cases  And I also think  That now that people  Are a little more hip  To what's potentially  Going to happen  These guys know  That the police  Might be outside  Yeah  You know  Why not hang  And chat for a few minutes  Yeah  They know the inevitable  Let's just  Hey can I have another cookie  These are great  Maybe they'll leave  Yeah why cookies and lemonade 
[01:57:30]  This makes everyone happy  And comfortable  You know  It started  You know  We had snacks  In the first one  And you know  The young actress  Who looks even younger  Who was working as a decoy  Actually just made cookies  Kind of  Because there's nothing else  Anyone talk about  How great the cookies are  We did in Florida  We had the  Yeah  A fan of the cookies  You know  You want to get them  Sponsored by the way  You want to say  Sit down and have some  Country time lemonade  And some famous  Famous cookies  I'm sure  I'm sure stations 
[01:58:00]  We all know how sales are  Can we sponsor that thing  We can actually sell the beverage  I did notice the decoy  Was different  On one  Where now you're showing  Her face  We really didn't get a look  At the first decoy  And now the blonde girl  I guess  Well she worked for us  In Florida  In the last investigation  We changed it up  A little bit  Yeah  You know  Sometimes they'll work with us  For a couple  Investigations in a row  And  I noticed you give her  A little more face time  In these  The latest one  The decoy 
[01:58:30]  Was that a conscious decision  It was kind of the way  It worked out  We had been doing that  Little by little  You know  And it had been successful  So we did a little more  On this last one  It gives it a little more  Of a creep factor  With the guy  And actually  Talking to her  Yeah  Yeah  What he does  And then she  Disappears  And I come out  We had one in Texas  Where  The guy wanted some ice 
[01:59:00]  And there was no ice  At the bar  So he walks into the kitchen  To get the ice  And while he's in there  The decoy disappears  And I come out  So he comes walking back  You know  With the ice  And expecting the girl  Oh what a buzz kill  And he's always got  Some kind of line  Like hey  Got some ice to ya  Like when the guy's  Doing something unexpected  Like hey  Why don't you just  Take a seat there  Yeah  Or your cookies  Hey what's the  Oh Jimmy you got some  Yeah we want to get  Into the book  Before we take a break  So you got a book  Called To Catch a Predator  Protecting your kids  From online enemies  Already in your home 
[01:59:30]  Bob what's different  About this than the TV show  Is I guess what I wanted  To ask  We had  You know  Put together a ton  Of information  And important things  Especially for parents  That we just  Did not have time  To get into on this show  Things like  Issues like  Collateral damage  What happens to the  Wives and children  Of these guys  You know  Treatment versus punishment  You know  What do we do  With these guys  You know  And I've had the benefit  Of talking to some  Of the smartest people  In psychiatry  Law enforcement  And I've looked 
[02:00:00]  Into the eyes  Of 250 of these guys  And what I've done  Is I've taken  All that information  And distilled it  You know  Into 20 things  Parents can do  Not just  Okay  Don't do this  Don't do that  But ways of  Initiating a discussion  Things that a kid  Will keep in their mind  To keep them  Safe for our mind  Where do you think  This comes from  By the way  These guys  Wanting the real  Young girls  You know  It's  You know  There are obviously  Some people  Who are predisposed  To this  And I think 
[02:00:30]  Some guys  Who are  Open to the idea  But who would not  Do this  Without the internet  Spend hours  And hours  And hours  In the chat rooms  And on these  Porn sites  And you know  They get off  On the sites  That cater to people  Who are interested  In younger  Target  They have  On the net too  It's a really weird thing  They have sites  That are about  Young girls  But they're not  Porn sites  They're just  These creepy sites  There was one  About this girl  Jessie 
[02:01:00]  Almost like parents  Put up photos  Of their kids  In bikinis  And doing all this  Non-sexual stuff  Wink wink  But you know  What it is  It's a really weird  Lie that they think  They're having  These sites  Taken down now  But it's almost  Like legal  Pedophile sites  Well it's  There are sites  That obviously  Are catering  To guys  Who are wired  This way  But it's hard  For law enforcement  To  Trying to stay  Within the boundaries  Of the law  To take them down  Because  Okay so what  You know  What constitutes  Child porn  And there's a fine line  With those sites  Well yeah 
[02:01:30]  We have to take a break  Do you want to hang out  Sure I've got some time  Alright we've got some  Phone calls coming in  For Chris Hansen  The new book's  Called To Catch a Predator  We'll continue in just a bit  It's the Opie and Anthony show  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The Opie and Anthony virus  That's right it is  The Opie and Anthony show  We've got Chris Hansen in studio  His new book is  To Catch a Predator  Protecting your kids  From online enemies  Already in your home  And we were talking  About some of the scams 
[02:02:00]  That are going on out there  And Anthony you mentioned  As I walk back  Into the studio  Black money  Well Chris is doing  A special from Africa  I guess  Coming up  Well Europe also  On these scams  We've all seen them  In our emails  You know  Somebody from Nigeria  Kind of drops you a line  And says they have  Ten million dollars  They need to remove  From the country  And they need your help  And if you contact  These people  They'll string you along  And slowly drain you  Of all your money  One of these things  I heard is  Black money 
[02:02:30]  What they do is  They say they take  Hundred dollar bills  And they've dyed them black  To get them out of the country  So it doesn't come across  As money  And you have to buy  A chemical  It has to be  If it's not money  It's in the shape of money  But it's black  It's in a wallet  Exactly  I guess why I'm asking  Is that it amazes me  That people actually  Fall for some of these  Scams to begin with  Yeah  Something like that  It's like  Why else would they  Have to get this  Out of the country  What they do  Is they give you  A small sample  Of a chemical  Or you have to go to them  And they show you  How this works  And you'll have 
[02:03:00]  All this money  But the chemical  Is very expensive  And to get as much  As you need  To de-ink  A million dollars  Or so  It's going to cost you  A lot of money  And people give them  This money  It amazes me  That people fall for this  You know  You look at these things  And on the surface  You say  Who would fall for that  You know  What are you thinking about  But these scammers  Are so good  At getting people  Emotionally  And mentally  Invested in this thing  Where sometimes people  Really start to believe  They're going to make some money  We had a case in Michigan 
[02:03:30]  County  Treasure  Who decided  To not only invest  Some of his money  But some of the county's money  Allegedly  And of course  That got lost  And now there's a big  Oh man  He's in trouble  Big problem  Yeah  It just  Any of those scams  I'm so leery of them  And you would think  In this day and age  More people would be  Computer literate  Enough to recognize  A scam  Or phishing  Which you know  That I was just telling  You happened to me  The other day  My bank had sent me  An email  And said  That there were  Charges that they 
[02:04:00]  Weren't sure of  And click on this link  And please  Put in this info  And I was like  No  This obviously  Isn't going to my bank  I could see the URL up top  It's different  Than my bank would be  And you would think  People would be more  Computer savvy in 2007  Well I think  A lot of folks  You know  Get home from work  Click on the computer  And they're just trying  To get through the emails  Like oh  I'll get rid of this  And do that  I mean  In the credit card fraud  Story we were talking about  Earlier  It's on in a couple weeks  One of the women  One of the victims 
[02:04:30]  We profiled  Did exactly that  Just came home in a hurry  And clicked it  And next thing you know  Her account was great  It was her  You know  Her ATM card  Her debit card  Did she get her money back?  She did ultimately  Yeah  The banks are good  About this sort of thing  But what was amazing to me  Is just the volume  Of fraud  That goes on  With stolen identities  And stolen credit card numbers  I mean  Stuff that  I mean  Every day  I mean  Electronics  And all kinds of products  That are bought  And then shipped overseas  To sell  It's a billion dollar 
[02:05:00]  Billion dollar  Internet has opened up  A whole new landscape  For this too  It used to be  I guess  You know  The people  The old stories  Of them  Rummaging through your garbage  And you know  Finding your identity that way  Now you have a virtual  Online garbage pail  To rummage through  And steal people's identity  That way  I mean  There are ways  To protect all that  But I think  A lot of people  Just haven't gotten  A hip to  How to do it  And you got to  Take that extra minute  And think about  What you're doing online 
[02:05:30]  When you look at  Mark Foley  Or a guy  Who can get busted  By just having  Something copied  And saved  A lot of people  Who are over the age  Of 25  Don't realize  That you can save  Everything  They don't understand  The dangers of it  Because they didn't  Grow up with computers  I got a  Go ahead  I got an interesting call  I want to make sure  Sure absolutely  It's just like  You know  You got to teach your kids  Not to give out  All kinds of information  On their social networking sites  I mean  These predators  For instance  Whether it's a financial predator  Or a computer  Sexual predator  You know 
[02:06:00]  These guys are really good  At taking bits and pieces  From a kid's  My space  And getting into a conversation  And grooming a kid  Over a period of weeks  And finding out  Where they are  And setting up a meeting  You know  One of the things is  We say be careful of strangers  But some of these predators  Are so good  At developing a relationship  The kid doesn't think  It's a stranger  You've built up  Like an outline  Of what this kid's about  Interests  And now you can  Kind of talk  Like you're interested  In the same things  And kids have to know that  You know  That these guys are out there  Hey I got an observation 
[02:06:30]  You have a way  Of looking at people  You're not looking  At my soul  Are you?  Anyone else  Getting a little paranoid  As he just looks  Deep into your eyes  And when he talks  It's like  Look man  I have nothing to hide  Well  Keep your hands  You barely have nothing to hide  Like why is he looking  So intensely at me man  We got Laura from Glen Cove  Laura  You're on with Chris Hansen  Good morning fellas  How are you?  Hello  Hi Chris 
[02:07:00]  I actually work with  One of the guys  That was featured  Actually on the show  Eddie  He was a TV producer  Supposedly  Sure I remember him well  He was  He came over to visit us  In our first investigation  In Long Island  Yeah he's definitely  Creepy  He had actually  It was a rumor  Going around that  He was on it  But no one could find  The footage  Online  Until finally  Someone that doesn't  Even work with us  They actually work  In another office  In the same building  Had pointed it out to us  And showed us  Where to find it  This was a guy  Who came over 
[02:07:30]  After an explicit  Online conversation  And he knocks on the door  And comes in  And he says to the decoy  He says  You know  Tell me you're 19  And she says  Well I already told you  I'm 14  And he goes back and forth  And back and forth  And it gets pretty tense  Remember this is the first one  So we're still kind of  Figuring out  Feeling it out  Sure  And so finally  The decoy says  Well okay whatever  I'm 19  And he comes in  And of course I come out  And he says  I knew it  I knew it  And we go back and forth  He says  I knew it  I was just  You know  Checking this out  I knew it was a sting  I said  Well what do you do for a living  He said  I'm a television producer  I said  You know  Ironically 
[02:08:00]  I work in television too  I see this  You know  Got it  And he congratulated us  On our good work  And looking forward to seeing the story  But he was free to go right  Because that was early on  In that first investigation  I believe there was only one case  That was prosecuted  And that was a New York City firefighter  Who surfaced in the investigation  Yeah  But it did destroy  You know  Part of their life  I'm sure it gave him that  Little kick in the ass 
[02:08:30]  Not to do it again  Perhaps  I don't know  It seems like  You're ruining your life  Well I think in some cases  It probably has  I mean  You know  It's a wake up call  For some of these guys  Unless you're a lonely  Creepy guy  In a one room apartment  You know  With the neon hotel light  Blinking outside  You know  A lot of these guys  Have families  Jobs  That you know  Would just be  Completely destroyed  Well people always ask  You know  What's the profile  Of one of these guys  Well you know  As you've seen in the stories  And you know  We talk about in the book  These are guys 
[02:09:00]  Who come from  Mainstream American  Now we get  You know  Our percentage of  Creepy looking fellas  Don't get me wrong  But the vast majority of them  Do not have the word  Predator  Tattooed on their forehead  Were there any times  That you felt like  You were really  In the room  With like a sociopath  Like a real problem  Who could be a problem  For you  Or you're in danger  We've had  I don't know  You know  A couple of tense moments  You know  In California  A military guy  Was there  And he'd already  Taken off his shirt  You know 
[02:09:30]  For the hot tub  Walked around and saw us  And we were face to face  And there was a  Split second there  Where I thought  This guy is thinking  About whacking me  I mean  And he's got the  Guns to do it  And it just  It was quiet for a minute  I said  Why don't you  Come on  Let's talk over there  Let's just sit right down  Over there  And he calmed down  And we had a  Long conversation  Well you do come across  And I think a lot of these guys  Think you're a cop  When you come out  You don't identify yourself  As an officer  And you don't see cameras there  Yeah  I think it's the way  You carry yourself 
[02:10:00]  And you kind of  You take control  Of the situation  You tell them  Hey  Sit down  You're kind of  You know  Presenting yourself  As an authority figure  And I think that helps out  Well I think  Some of these guys  Think I might be  With law enforcement  I mean  I don't try to  Be that way  I think some think  I might be the father  You know  We've had that  You know  Tell your daughter  I'm sorry  I would never do this  Or tell your son  But  Your daughter's a slut  Jesus  Hey real fast  Laura  So what happened to Eddie?  Oh  Oh well he's still around 
[02:10:30]  He's  I'm not going to say  Where we work  You know  We were in sales though  And I could tell  He was giving you  A pitch there Chris  When he was talking to you  But  I actually took over  His old seat  With his computer  And me and the IT guy  It must have taken us  Hours to get all the porn  Off it  Really?  Yeah  That's interesting  Was it child porn  Or was it just regular stuff?  Well I didn't really  I didn't really want to  Check it out all that much  But it just seemed like  You know  Regular porn  I hope you changed out  The keyboard  Yeah  No kidding  But he's still around 
[02:11:00]  You see him?  Yeah  He actually  I was  This guy's walking free?  Pardon me?  Yeah  Yeah absolutely  I mean  We would go out  You know  After work for drinks and stuff  And this was before  I even knew  You know  And he would say  Wear Chuck E. Cheese  He would always recommend  Can we go to Chuck E. Cheese  Tonight?  He would just say  Really really nasty stuff  I mean  I can recall  Some pretty vulgar things  He had said  You know  About women  That he had been with  Or what he wanted to do  After work  And this that  And the other thing  Right  All right 
[02:11:30]  All right  Thank you Laura  Yeah  Thanks guys  Have a good day  All right  Let's go to Eric in New Jersey  Eric  Good morning guys  Good morning  Good morning Chris  You know  Obviously you're dealing  With a very serious  Subject matter  Very heavy stuff  I was just curious  Is there like a gag reel  No pun intended  There's not really a gag reel  But you know  I would love to see the bloopers  Clearly  There are some  Humorous moments  That pop up  You know  I mean  For instance  When we did the first one  They got 
[02:12:00]  They started coming so quickly  That it was hard  To keep the right transcript  With the right guy  You know  So I walk out  Oh no  With the transcript  I said  No it says here  That you came to meet  A 13 year old girl  By the name of so and so  No  No  Not me  Hang on  14 year old girl  Not me  Not me  13 year old girl  Yeah yeah  That's fine  Oh good  Okay  Okay we got the right  You just hope the age  Keeps going up  22 year old  Yes that was  Yeah the guy's hoping  He's keeping fingers crossed  Oh man  I got past 14  Come on 
[02:12:30]  15  Let's say hi to Joey in Jersey  Joey  Hey what's up guys  Hey  Hey  You guys were talking about  Credit card fraud  Or whatever before  I got a question  For Chris over there  Sure  What happened was  A couple years ago  Someone got a hold of my bank card  Because I'm an idiot  Left it at the ATM machine  And they rung up  Like $996  On Shop NBC  Two years later  I thought my bank  Took care of this  Now I'm at Shop NBC  And they're telling me  They have absolutely 
[02:13:00]  Zero record whatsoever  I have no idea  What to do about this  My bank says  That there's a record of it  Shop NBC  Has zero record  I went to the highest person  I could find there  And they have  Got nothing  Anywhere  Of their computer systems  Chris  Will get right on that  For you sir  That's right  Usually the banks  Are pretty good  About tracking this down  If you call the specific  Fraud  You know  Section of the bank  You know  They'll assign somebody  To you  And it may take a while  But they're good  At tracking it down 
[02:13:30]  Because they want to  Make an example  Of these guys too  Alright  He did that already  That's the problem  Yeah I don't know  Don't yell at Chris  Yeah he doesn't know  He doesn't know  What to do for you  I'm sorry  Let's say hi to Mary  She's a parent  Mary Connecticut  What's up  Hey Chris  It's Mary  Pierce's mom  Hey Mary  How are you  Good  I just want to thank you  I appreciate that  You have a dress  And you are  Taking care of  All of our  Worst fears  And I've always  Telled Chris  That you were going 
[02:14:00]  To do something  Very special  And important  So I run around  My house saying  Told ya  Told ya  So thank you  Sounds like a fan  Oh wait  No no  I know that she knows  Chris  Can you hear me  Yeah yeah  Alright Mary  Thanks very nice of you  Thank you  Alright and finally  Mike in Queens  Mike what's going on  Hey good morning  Good morning  I got a couple of questions  For Chris regarding this show  I mean I'm all for  Prosecuting predators  And stuff  But it's kind of like  Not realistic  He never mentions  About his decoys  What they're saying  To entice these guys 
[02:14:30]  Into these chats  They really don't mention  How they get them  And also  You know  In real case scenarios  Where children are talking  To these predators  And stuff  He really doesn't  Bring up the point  That their level  Of responsibility  For that  I mean  Hundreds of thousands  Of children out there  Are talking like this  To people  As a form of entertainment  And they're enjoying it  And you know  It's my space  And all that stuff  Like that  And it's like  And even Chris  He's doing this  In a form of entertainment 
[02:15:00]  With his sarcasm  And wisecrash  We laugh at it  I love watching the show  But I watch it  For the entertainment value  Not the shock value of it  Well I'll say a couple  Of things on that  One  You know  When these decoys  From Perverted Justice  Set up in a chat room  They have a profile  That includes a picture  That's unmistakably underage  They never make the first move  The guy always makes  The first move  Always  And in the vast majority  Of cases  The guy is the one  Who first brings upside  So that takes care  Of the one issue  In terms of  Me being a little creative 
[02:15:30]  With the questions  I think sometimes  That gets a more  Detailed response  From these guys  Alright Mike  I'm sorry you're disappointed  That he's  I'm not disappointed  That kind of files out there  I'm not disappointed  Let me tell you  What about all these  Six year olds  Mike  I'm going to look forward  To seeing you on the show  Yeah  Alright Mike  Thanks Mike  We got to leave it there  Go ahead Jimmy  Quick is called  The Catch a Predator  It's just great stuff  Protecting your kids  From online enemies  In your home  It's a lot more detailed  Than the show is obviously  And Chris Hansen 
[02:16:00]  Man you do a great thing  Thanks guys  Really  Pleasure being here  Thanks for coming down  My pleasure  Absolutely  We're going over to XM  If you're not joining us  Have a great day  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  The Opie and Anthony Show  THE END

[02:28:30]  Still getting great ratings  I don't watch it anymore though  Yeah I watch it when it's on  It seems to be the same old thing to me  As far as my TV goes  You gotta keep me interested  I don't know you go around the channels though  That's one of those things that I just can't get enough of  Because I love seeing people just really getting disappointed  Because you know those guys are just whipped into a froth  And they really want to have sex with these girls  And then when he pops out  Their face  And then it's a two sided thing  Because then when they walk it through that garage 
[02:29:00]  And the cops bust them  Oh they start crying sometimes  These are the best  Did you watch anything interesting over the weekend?  No like I said  I couldn't find anything to watch  What's going on with TV?  F.H. Riley's pretty much fucked my whole weekend up  Yeah I understand that  Made it real short  I'm all about just watching videos on YouTube  Break.com  GorillaCast.net  That's what I do now  It's so much more entertaining than TV  I just watch movies too  Like movies I've seen  Like 28 Days Later  Just pulled it out of the old catalog the other day 
[02:29:30]  Pulled that DVD out  And go yeah I'm just going to watch that one  It's a fun movie  I re-watched Murderball  That is an amazing documentary  I never saw that  I have it but I haven't seen it  I'll watch it tonight Jimmy  It's an amazing documentary  I was watching  My girlfriend I'm going to watch on Golden Pond tonight  Oh  Seriously?  Yeah  She loves old people  The loons  I was looking for little loons  You're a loon  I was watching The Company of Men yesterday  Did you ever see that shit?  Wait a minute  What is that one?  Oh  It's the two guys  Two office guys make a bet 
[02:30:00]  They want to wreck a girl's life  Like they both want to date her  And then just  Because they're on location for six weeks  In this office somewhere  And they're like  Alright let's just both date her  We'll get her hopes up  And then just dump her  Because they're both mad about shit  That's happened with women  So they just want to like break her heart  They don't want to kill her  They just want to break her heart  Yeah  So there's a deaf girl that works in the office  And they both start seeing her  And there's one of them  Is a really good looking guy  And there's another guy  It's Chad and Harold  Chad's a really handsome dude  And Harold's kind of like  Mopey with glasses 
[02:30:30]  And dumpy  And so they both start  Hanging out with this girl  And then she talks like that  Oh no  And one of the guys  Starts falling for her for real  It's very good man  It's a brutal movie  Like you watch it  The whole premise sounds very brutal  You watch it  And you really are like  Oh no  It's just  It's cruel  Who are the stars?  There's no name in it that I recognize  Oh that guy  Yeah  Did you recognize him? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah  He was in something  I kind of remember  Thank you for smoking  There you go  He's a good actor  Oh thank you  I knew I knew him  But I just didn't know from what  Yeah from the main guy  In thank you for not smoking  Or thank you for smoking  Or whatever the hell that movie was called  That was actually I liked  It's a very uncomfortable film  Yeah  Alright  Very uncomfortable  In the company of men  There's a Jimmy pic  In company of men  I checked out  Dice's Disaster  I haven't even  Fucking given that  I don't know  When it's on 
[02:31:30]  I  I really feel bad for the guy  It's just awful  There's no buzz about the show  It's just awful  Like I  I couldn't tell you when it's on  What channel it's on  I don't know  This week he was  Trying to get a makeover  And like  They were trying to dress him  As a metrosexual  And that  You know  Because he wouldn't do  Something like that  And it's so outrageous  For him to  Yeah  And then  And then he was thinking about  Maybe adding some hair in front  Yeah  To one of those hair specials  Some plugs 
[02:32:00]  Some plugs  Yeah great  But they have to draw  On you  But he doesn't like  People touching him  So he had  One of his other guys  Get drawn on  So he didn't even commit  To the bit for the show  It's just like  Jesus dude  It's so  Like the clips  That we've seen so far  Are so fake  And scripted  That I can't even  Like get into it  As a goof  Like you know  I'd like to watch it  So we could goof on it  A little more  But it's not even funny  To like to goof on  The show aspect of it 
[02:32:30]  He's funny to goof on  Yeah you would think  We would all watch it  Just so we could have fun  And goof on it  But it's so bad  That you're not watching it  Yeah it's not even  Fucking goof on-able  And you're the guy  That does dice  I'd rather just do him  In those weird situations  Like I'm an astronaut  Right right  You know I don't care  Where we put him  Right  It doesn't have to be  His own show  I'm a sailor  You know  Da da da da da  Hey olive oil  You know I don't care  What he's doing  Yeah  I haven't seen one episode  I know all those guys  I like Lee Lawrence a lot 
[02:33:00]  And I know Todd  And I know Wheels  Well Todd's now out  Is he out?  Yeah he's the latest guy  That got backstabbed by  Dice  Casualty  Me and Todd  Used to meet chicks together  We actually fucking  Banged a couple of chicks  In the room together  Todd has a big hug  Yeah yeah yeah  Todd's a good boy  I heard some things  That now Todd's the one  He's the latest one  That's on the outside  He's always on the outside  Todd's the one  Yeah well you know  Todd  He has to go through  His punishment stage  That could last  Anywhere from a month  To I don't know  Years  Ten years  What a douche  Someone is saying  Hey have you checked out  Black Donnelly's  No but this weekend 
[02:33:30]  People around me  Started talking about  This show Black Donnelly's  Right  And they said  It's terrific  I don't know much about it  So I'll stop there  But supposedly  It's a show people  Tell me I should check out  Let's go to Blue Balls  From Ohio  Blue Balls  Hey what's going on guys  Don't watch what  With Girlfriend  It's in the company of men  Oh why  Because the parts  That you laugh at  Your girl will find  So offensive  It's kind of like  When you laugh at  The funny parts  In American Psycho 
[02:34:00]  Any normal chick  Would just be like  Why are you doing this  I need an example though  You're laughing at what  And she didn't find it funny  Oh just the absolute cruelty  Just don't give away  The ending dude  I'll give you an example  Oh yeah  Oh the ending  Beautiful  I'll give you an example  There's an example  Where you can see  That the one guy  Is starting to like  The deaf girl a little bit  The one guy's talking  About his date with her  And he goes  Like yeah man  Just listening to her talk  Like he's like  I'm starting to like her  But you know  You just kind of 
[02:34:30]  You think about  When you're out with her  It's kind of embarrassing  You're just hoping  You want to run down  A side street  Like you know  When it looks like  She was  I forget how he put it  Like she was straining to talk  But it was such a cruel way  He described her talking  You're like  Oh girl  Were you laughing at  No  But I mean that's the kind of thing  Because Florentine told me  He actually laughed out loud  At the theater  When he saw it  At the worst parts  I couldn't stop  So I know  Like that's what  I'm afraid he's going to say  The ending  That's why I jumped in  I didn't mean to interrupt you bro  Alright  Thanks Blue Balls  Alright thanks guys  That could be a good little 
[02:35:00]  Topic for a while  Stuff you laugh at  Then your chick  You know  Punches you real hard  Like how can you laugh  At something  That happened to me  Years ago  With old Bill  Oh yeah  Old Bill  That was a Mickey Rooney  Played the retard  Yeah  And I was sitting on the couch  And watching it with my girlfriend  That truly should be in the comedy section  Of Blockbuster  Yeah  It's just a goof  An old Mickey Rooney movie  Called Bill  And when he's walking down the street  And his toupee  Is like twisted sideways  And he's trying to find  My sister Sarah 
[02:35:30]  And he's just walking like a retard  And I started laughing my ass off  And my girlfriend just  Like wailed me in the arm  She was crying  Shut up  The best scene is the chicken scene though  Oh boy  They had Bill over for chicken  Fried chicken I think  It was Dennis Quaid  Yeah  Dennis Quaid  Plays a young filmmaker  And he wants to do a documentary  On this guy Bill  One of my proudest  Mickey Rooney  One of my proudest moments  On the opening anthony show  As far as celebrating  Interviewing celebrities  I'm a little slow from FH2 myself 
[02:36:00]  Yeah  We didn't ask him about  All the other great movies he was in  Oh Dennis Quaid  Yeah  Remember when we just obsessed  And just started talking about  The movie Bill  Over and over again  A movie that maybe  A thousand people saw  Yeah it was the second  We got him on the phone  It was like hello  And he goes hey  How you guys doing  I'm like it's my buddy  My buddy  Barry  Barry  My buddy  And I wouldn't stop doing it  And he was laughing  He was laughing his ass off  He thought it was funny  Yeah but anyway  But the movie yeah  It's like this young filmmaker 
[02:36:30]  And he's gonna make a documentary  Out of Bill  Who is this guy  Who it turns out  Wasn't really retarded  When he was a kid  He was like  He had some problems  Maybe autism  Who knows  But they put him in an institution  When he was really young  And growing up in an institution  Made him kind of fucking retarded  So this guy  Barry  Who's played by Dennis Quaid  Kind of befriends him  And gets him a job  At the college  And Bill just fucks shit up  And he brings him home one day  To meet his parents 
[02:37:00]  And he's got his wife with him  And everything  And his parents  And his mother's making chicken  And he brings out this big thing of chicken  And they live in an upscale  Like neighborhood in Connecticut  Or something  Yeah yeah  So you can just figure out  What the parents are all about  You can tell the parents are like  Oh get this fucking filthy animal  Out of my fucking house  No desire to have Bill over for dinner  But they're doing it for their son I guess  And she brings out the chicken  And Bill just goes  Oh boy  Chicken  And he  With his bare  Retard  Dirty  Fucking finger up his ass hand 
[02:37:30]  Cause you know  Fucking retards  They're just touching everything  Awful  Fucking shoving it up his nose  Up his ass  Touching his dick  And he grabs it with his bare hand  This piece of chicken  And then grabs like every piece  And she's  The mother's like  Oh you must be hungry Bill  And Barry starts going  Bill now  Remember your diet  And he goes  Oh I like chicken  He's not listening  And just mauling  All the pieces of chicken  On the tray  He just piles up his plate  With all the chicken  And then stupid Barry  Like yells at him  And he runs into a corner 
[02:38:00]  In the kitchen  And apparently  They take the chicken  And just put it back  On the platter  For other fucking people  To have to eat  I'd just be like  Dude  I'm not fucking eating  The retard chicken  But Mickey Rooney has Bill  With the bad wig  Just like  Yeah  Freaks out  Starts screaming  And runs away  Runs away  He stands in the corner  I got good hair  And good teeth  And I'm a regular  Good man  He's one of the worst  Retard movies ever  They're trying to pull  At your heartstrings  But it's  It's hilarious  It's too funny  It's hilarious  Let's go to Matt 
[02:38:30]  On Long Island  Matt what's up  Yeah I watched  In the company of men  With this girl  When it was over  It was like we had  Just both seen a rape  She wasn't into it at all  Dude it's an uncomfortable movie right  It's the most uncomfortable movie  It's just  As it's going on  It just gets more and more weird  And you're just sitting there  Like  How the hell is this gonna end  I won't ruin it  But  You definitely have to watch it  And it's not like  It's physically violent  Or she doesn't get  The shit kicked out  It's just  Emotionally  You really feel  You're like  It's really fucking uncomfortable  And well done man 
[02:39:00]  Yeah  It's like  How to tear down  Someone emotionally  Yeah it's really sad  Destroy him  I'm gonna have to  Take a look at that  Did I tell you that  Me and my girlfriend  Watched recently  And I was  Teary eyed  Oh I was crying  No really  But I've seen it already  I don't know why I was crying  I was just feeling sad  Can we play a game  And try to figure it out  Um okay  It's a movie  Popular movie obviously  Yes  Within the last  Two years  No  Old school movie  No  I want to say  Six seven years  Six seven years 
[02:39:30]  A movie that Jimmy would cry  Oh yeah I think you told us right  Six cents  Oh did I tell you  I'm sorry  Okay I forgot  Alright  I thought that sounded familiar  I don't remember  I thought that sounded familiar  It's funny  As I'm saying it  I'm like did I say this  Yeah  Okay  The scene in the car  Yeah yeah  Okay I did  And the ghost tells  Nicolette  Yeah  What's her name in there  That the mother was  Tony  Tony  Colette  Colette is the mom  We interviewed her  We tried to look up her skirt  Remember  Yeah yeah  We did try to look up her skirt  We tried to catch her little cooch  I don't know why  Because she didn't look as hot in person 
[02:40:00]  As she did in Sixth Sense  I know but she had the accent in person  The Australian accent  She was cool  Why are we killing her  I know  I'm not killing her  I wanted to look at her vag  She came in to talk about  Little Miss Sunshine by the way  Oh was she in that  Yeah she was the mother in that  The ghost tells her character  Yeah yeah yeah  That her mom did see her  At her little dance recital  Even though all these years  She thought that mom missed out  On a big day in her life  And my girlfriend crying  Not crying last night though  Were you  When I gave you two good deep dickings  Wow  Yeah  She got fucking two good deep dickings 
[02:40:30]  And we've been fighting too  I kind of  We were breaking up  And then  You've been broken up?  Well no  Just for a day or two  We were fighting  I told you  Over that fat comment  It really bugged me  Are you allowed to see other women  When you break up for a day or two?  Let's hope so  No I'm kidding  No I'm not  I did  I actually  Not only was I good  When I was in California  Yeah  But my friend came to the show  Who does pornography  And I didn't even  Take her back  We just hung out  And she came to the show 
[02:41:00]  And that was completely innocent  What did you do?  Turning a new leaf  Regular guy  Well when I got home  What a fucking  Yeah?  Yeah  And then afterwards  She starts getting weird  She's afraid of intimacy  She's awful like I am  She's not good with intimacy  So after we have this great sex  She's like talking about our argument  And I'm like why baby  Are we talking about this now?  She's like no I'm just saying  I think we need therapy  And I'm like alright  Maybe we do  And then a few minutes later  All of a sudden  We're having a little nurse chatter  And my balls are being rubbed  And what do you know?  Time for another deep dicking miss  Miss 
[02:41:30]  Missy  It was hot man  Oh shit  She's dirty  She's fucking dirty  It's great  I can't believe how dirty she is  It's her shit dude  I love her  No I love it about her  It's a sexy quality man  She's fucking got that little monster  That's sexy  Yeah  Yeah  It's a great  A great thing to have  I can't  I don't want to fuck some square  Who's just not  You're square  Jimmy I'm not mocking it  But it's your chick  I don't think she wants two countries  To know that she's got  Oh no no  You're probably right 
[02:42:00]  Absolutely not  That's what I'm getting at  She probably wants them to know  She's got my fucking seed  Shooting around  And they're sloshing around  In there  Two fucking potent loads  I might add  Really  Oh yeah good ones  How do we know  There's not going to be  A little Jimmy  Yeah she might get  Are you guys taking  Precaution  No  Of course we're taking  Precaution  Of course she is  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  Oh yeah  She's on the pill  And fucking sure  Drinks gas after we fuck  Drinks gas 
[02:42:30]  She wants nothing to do  With an old toddler  That is great  Drinks gas  She doesn't want to be a mom  Not at this point  I wanted to ask her this question  I was wondering  What would happen  Because I always  Whenever I fly  Whenever I go to fly  I say look  I'll see you baby  Unless my plane crashes  And I'm killed  And this is the last time  You ever see me  Then you'll probably  Regret like all the fights  You had and stuff like that  And then I leave  I always say something  Fuck you're awful  And you fly every weekend 
[02:43:00]  Yeah but chances are  I kind of like do that  Because chances are  That's never the last thing  You say to somebody  Oh because then she'd say  The last thing he said  Was if the plane crash  No one ever said that  No never  So I was thinking  What would happen  What would she do  If like her pill  Like say she took  The wrong day or something  And I got her pregnant  And then I was killed  In a plane crash  Coming home  And then she realized  She was pregnant  And it was mine  That baby had hit the ground  Before your plane did  You're probably right  Probably some kind of 
[02:43:30]  An experiment  Like the Tuskegee Airmen  Or whatever the fuck  They were called  Tuskegee  Whatever they were called  Tuskegee  Tuskegee  Tuskegee is it what they were called  Yeah Tuskegee  Tuskegee  Who the fuck knows  The Jersey Airmen  I just like to call him  Like would she have the baby  Or would she like  Yeah would she  Would she just kill  The last remaining  Like it would have to be  Some kind of  In memoriam to you  I guess  Well would she kill  The last remaining piece of me 
[02:44:00]  And I shouldn't phrase it like that  We should call her and ask her  No but I will ask her  No she  Ask her  Get the answer for tomorrow  I will  That's your homework assignment  I want to know that  I'll take home a test for you  John in Utah  What's up  Yeah  My oldest daughter  Is autistic  And I got punched in the head  Because of you guys  She was headbutting my friend  In the chest  And then she wrapped her arms  Around him  And my husband  Was picking him up  And he goes 
[02:44:30]  Wow man she's really strong  And I go  Yeah she's got that retard strength  Just thinking of you guys  Wow  My wife just turned  And just plowed me  With the thing that made it so hilarious  So we were all just laughing  And she goes  That's not the right to say  What else am I supposed to call it  Yeah  You're the dad  You gotta have a little bit of an event  Yeah you just have a little fun right  Yeah  Making your day burnable  Alright John thank you  Alright  Got a little uh  A weird  Don't touch that mic Jimmy  Something's gonna get electrocuted 
[02:45:00]  Yeah it goes  Now  We've only been telling people for a while  But yeah just touch it  Watch what happens  Nope  Nope  See you hear that  Oh yeah  It's a little scary  I am uh  Yeah we're gonna watch  On Golden Pond tonight  Aww  You'll probably cry watching that  Alright here we go  It's an old fucker  We watch stupid Norman  Look for his blueberries  I'm gonna put on his stomach  And fuck her  While Norman's lost  I'm lost  I couldn't fight  You're my knight in shining  Blah 
[02:45:30]  Blah  Blah  He's pounding away  I got your blueberries right here  Alright we got a fucked up story  Coming out of Germany here this morning  Patrick and Susan are in love  Their love has produced four children  No problem right  That is fucked up for Germany  Huh  That is fucked up for Germany  He's in love with a chicken  What do you think the problem is  You got Patrick  You got Susan  They got four kids  What could possibly be wrong with this relationship  Patrick 
[02:46:00]  Is  Gay  There's a woman  Patrick and Susan  They're married  They have four kids  But there's a problem  They are  Brother and sister  What  That's a good one Jimmy  That's a good one  You're crazy  Where does that come from  Honestly I don't know  It's just a guess  It's an honest guess  Their love  Is also  Illegal in Germany  Because Patrick and Susan  Are brother  And sister  Wow  I swear to you 
[02:46:30]  I did not know that  You're cheating  No I wouldn't have did it  I was only thinking  What could be taboo about  Because you said  Here's what gave it away to me  You said  What could it be  Because you stopped it right after  Married with kids  So I'm like  Alright  But why couldn't it like be  He decided to become a chick or something  I felt like transvestite  Maybe that could have been  But I'm like  That was a lucky guess  I never get them right  Brother and sister  That's nice  Four kids  Together  Not adopted  I guess the kid 
[02:47:00]  We'll find out some fun things here  Sister  People harass us all the time  Call us the incest couple  They have no idea who you really are  Or how it all happened  Patrick says  Patrick spent more than two years in jail  For sleeping with his sister  To try to prevent a return to jail  Patrick and Susan are currently embroiled  In a court struggle  That has captivated Germany  The couple is trying to get their relationship legalized  Yeah, that's good 
[02:47:30]  The sister  Yeah  Fucking the sister  Stupid  Caligula used to fuck his sister too  Yeah  Well then it can't be all that bad  It's weird  It's a tough call though  Because you should be able to do it if you want to  But  The problem is  Genetically  Can't the kid be fucked up  So you could be making these little misses  We're going to find that out in a minute or two  Oh boy  It's a little weird man  For kids  They swear they're in love  There's a little twist to the story  That's fucked up  How the fuck do you do that  Like there's no way  At least you know your in-laws  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:48:00]  Yeah  The family gatherings are small  That is really fucked up  You wouldn't do that  Ew  No  Stop  I'm just saying  I want you guys to picture your sister  Nah nah nah  I mean would you  Nah nah nah  And you do it at the same time  Picture yours  We all have sisters  Oh yeah I forgot  Yeah  Well let's play  No  I give you your sister Jimmy  What  I can't  I actually can't do a good ass fucking  Bend her over and fuck her in the ass  I'm thinking of her strapping one on  And teaching me a brotherly lesson  We're having these dirty thoughts 
[02:48:30]  No I can't even comprehend it  It's gross on a level that it's supposed to be gross on  Just look down at your sister's face  While you're tit-fucking her  What do you think Jimmy?  Awful  You started this game  I know but I wasn't thinking of my own sibling  Let's have some fun here  You're squeezing her tits together  Your cock is going in and out  What do you think Jimmy?  How's that smoothie?  Jimmy Jimmy  And then you just shoot a hot load in her face  You started this game  Nice  Fucking sisterly love  You're cool  Um alright  No I don't know 
[02:49:00]  Picture your sister  Uh huh  Uh  Picture her laying on her back  Sure  And um  Her head's hanging over the bed  And you're fucking her  And she goes  And you're fucking her throat  And you're fucking her throat  And she says  I'm gonna tell mom  This is just gross  And she leans over and tells mom  By the way this is today's boner  Oh this is awful 
[02:49:30]  Today's more really hard  Today's more sponsored by incest  Uh  Grandmothers are easier  Alright look  Cause grandmothers like  Cause grandmother  Everyone has a grandmother  Whether she's alive or dead  Yeah  Like a grandmother  But a sister like  It's just too specific  Really creepy  Hey um  The phones are lit  I don't know why  This could get a little ugly  Why?  Let's get to the rest of the story  I got a worse one for you  What?  Picture  I don't know  No he has a brother  You have a brother  I don't have a brother 
[02:50:00]  So it's not fair  Yeah you can't do brother abuse  If you don't have a brother  Yeah it's fair  And we all have sisters  So keep it uh  Keep it fair  Keep it fair  Alright  Is it gross though  Honestly  Let me ask people with brothers in general  Is it gross  To picture your brother  Sucking your cock  I said keep it fair  That's probably the worst  Picture looking down  And you're seeing your brother's face  Like not only hold it  But look up with his eyebrows raised  Like am I doing it good? 
[02:50:30]  Alright  Oh is that awful?  Is that gross?  I'm tapping out  Yeah that would be uh  That would be gross  Would you be able to come?  Maybe  He's good  But you'd be all shamed  Because your brother  And your dick is like limp  Like a noodle  But he's angry  So he's got your balls in his hand  And he's sucking  And he puts your finger down  By your ass  He's like  Oh you're horrid man  Is that gross?  Yeah that's  That would qualify as being gross 
[02:51:00]  I have four brothers  I have four brothers  When you just had that picture  You know picture that scenario  I actually pictured one in general  Uh oh  I'm just kidding  Yeah  It's funny  That is bad  He had to pick a favorite  Right I had to pick  Alright here  More to the story  Coming out of Germany  Many other European countries  Long ago lifted bans  On incestuous sex  And Dr. Hendrik Wilhelm  Wants to take Patrick and Susan's case  To Germany's highest court  Ah  Incest is not socially harmful 
[02:51:30]  And only socially harmful behavior  May be punished  Like big Jewel  And no government is allowed  To punish behavior  That is not harmful to society  Not harmful  Now at this point  If they break this couple up  Doesn't it affect the children?  The children don't know any better  Is it would be put on a box car  Yeah  It's very weird  What do you do?  I mean I don't know  Are the kids fucked up?  Yeah that's what I'd like to know  Are the kids messed up?  You gotta think how it's going to affect the kids too 
[02:52:00]  I mean  They have to grow up with this  And  They can all have incest too  Like  Is pedophilia  I don't know  It's Germany  They're fucked up anyway  Hey uh  Reading writes  Imagine your sister  Cheating on you  With your brother  Can you guys  No can you picture  Alright stop  I'm just curious  What it will be like  Like there's  There's a girl  There's a woman on her stomach  And her  Her pants are pulled down  To her mid thigh  You have your hands 
[02:52:30]  Wrapped under her legs  And you're licking her pussy  And your nose is kind of by her ass  And her ass stinks  And you look up  And your mom turns around  And just pushes her ass back  Like  Oh god  You know how awful mom ass must think  Oh my god  Took our cute little game from Friday  And fucked it all up  I didn't hear it  It really did 
[02:53:00]  We just had a cute little game  Picture your grandma naked  But you have to always  With a come hither look  She looks over her shoulder  Gives it a little  And her like  Flabby ass is there  How about this  Takes you a grandma  With her three fingers  In her pussy  And she pulls them out  And wipes them on your mouth  And then you suck at her fingers  Her wrinkly fingers  Let's get to the end  Of this incest story  Oh grandma 
[02:53:30]  And you can smell  The metallic charm bracelet  Right by your nose  That's how far  She puts her hand in  And one of the charms on it  Is you  Because she's a little grandkid  There we go  The first two of Patrick  And Susan's children  Were born with disabilities  Legal documents say  Though it is not known  Whether these disabilities  Are related to incest  Youth welfare services  Have taken all but one  Of their four children  Away from them  The first child  Just kind of happened  Then they took the second  One away from us 
[02:54:00]  So we wanted to have  Another one  Because we'd already lost  So much Patrick says  Patrick and Susan  Didn't know of each other's existence  Until they were teens  Patrick was raised by foster parents  Later he found his real mother  And his sister  After their mother died  The two continued to live together  And ended up falling in love  Now they say  All they want  Is to live like a normal family  So they didn't know each other  They didn't know each other  Until they're teens  Alright  Now all bets are off 
[02:54:30]  Still gotta say no  I say it's much better  With a half brother or sister  Simply because of the genetics  The genetics are the problem  Oh I mean genetically  And stuff like that  But you can't blame them  For banging her  Oh no not at all  You know like  If they just met in their teens  Eh you gotta  You gotta throw her one  Yeah that's a blood  I couldn't do that  With somebody who's blood  Yeah that's twisted man  Who knows though  You don't know her  She's a stranger  Yeah but at least  Just fuck her ass  I mean why do you  Have to get to knock her up  How is she a stranger  You're looking at her  She looks like you  With a wig on  Like that  I hope not  Jesus  Go teaburn 
[02:55:00]  I'm just saying  My balls  The similarities though  Both of you doing impressions  At the same time  No they knew  They were brother and sister  Though when they met  Right  Yeah  Okay that's weird  If you don't know  And then all of a sudden  You're doing it  Yeah  Alright we're gonna take a break  Can we picture more stuff later  Yeah let's  I got a doozy  Let's think of picturing stuff  You wanna do it now  Or after the break  What's your doozy  Alright let's end it  With this doozy  Alright so maybe  We can regroup 
[02:55:30]  Alright picture  You're like  Just picture  Your dad in boxers  And all of a sudden  He calls you over  And he tries to push  Your head onto his cock  And you're like  What are you doing  And he's just like  Oh god damn  Is that the most  Awful thing  It's horrid  I want everyone out there  In radio world 
[02:56:00]  To just pause for a moment  He just goes  Yeah come on  I don't  Like almost pulls your hair  Impressed in the morning  Suppressed memories  All right 
[02:56:30]  All right  All right  All right  We interrupt this program  To bring you  The Bozone Midget Sighting  Of the Day  Hey Izzy  What's up  Uh  Izzy  Izzy  Hey hey hey  Sorry guys  It's all right  You're from Teaneck  What do you got  I saw the funniest  Damn midget sighting  I ever saw  Guy hacking away  At the ice  And shoveled  Twice his size  Oh you called earlier 
[02:57:00]  And I couldn't get to you  It said  You saw a midget  With a huge shovel  Yeah  A huge snow shovel  Yeah  He had these teeny  Little boots  Like they protect them  From an inch of snow  Teeny little boots  And they don't make  Midget shovels  So he had a full size  Snow shovel  They do  They're called spoons  He had like holding  At the handle  Right next to the shovel  Yeah  And at the end  The handle part  Was like swinging around  It's got no leverage  He made eye contact  With me  I was laughing so hard 
[02:57:30]  And he kind of  Scurried away  He just kind of  Waddled away  Like a roach  So sad  Back into hiding  It was so funny man  God that is funny  With the oversized shovel  Big shovel  He can only take like  Quarter shovel  Fulls at a time  His little arms  The snow piles  Were up to like  His shoulder  It wasn't up to his shoulder  And he was kind of  Hacking away at the ice  It was so funny to watch  Might have been  If it like  He got plowed in  Or something  Yeah  It could have been up  To his shoulder 
[02:58:00]  And it's all icy now  Oh that's terrible  Poor little fidget  Thank you sir  Talk to you later  Yep  Meanwhile  Back at the show  Getting into other things today  Trump is just terrific  Donald Trump went off  Is he just yelling at people now  To get publicity  He's like calling people names  And  Call him the Donald  The Donald  Well it all started with  Rosie  Rosie  And he got a lot of publicity  From that  And I think  Something clicked inside 
[02:58:30]  The Apprentice  Just getting horrific ratings  This time around  No one's watching  I think that show  Is just about done  Although I think  They signed him  For another two  Or something like that  But the ratings  Are not kind  And then  They went after us  Which is  Trust me  I know we're not  A huge target  But  No but  He had his problem  With us all of a sudden  And now  This is where  It gets interesting  It was all fun and games  But now he's just  Going after Bush  Whoa  What a rebel  Who isn't  Exactly  Defend Bush 
[02:59:00]  If you want to be rebellious  Well I don't think  That's what the South Park guys  Are saying  Huh  Nat and Trey  What were they saying  They're saying like  You want to be a rebel  These days  He goes  Go to  Some  You know  Hollywood event  And just praise  George Bush  He goes  Bashing him  Is you know  Not a rebellious thing  To do  Everyone's doing it  So him bashing Bush  Now he's a little late  You think he's late  To the party  Yeah  I don't know  I think he does it  Differently than most  Celebrities  Does he  Yeah I think  I hadn't heard it so  I think the rest of 
[02:59:30]  I think the celebrities  That do go after Bush  Kind of puss out  In the end  They really do  For Donald  Let's take a listen  This is what Trump  Had to say about Bush  The war is a total disaster  It's a catastrophe  Nothing less  It is such a shame  That this took place  In fact  I gained a lot of respect  For our current  President's father  By the fact that he  Had the sense  Not to go into Iraq  He won the war  And then said  Let's not go  The rest of the way  And he turned out  To be right  And Saddam Hussein 
[03:00:00]  Whether they like him  Or didn't like him  He hated terrorists  He'd shoot  And kill terrorists  When terrorists  Came into this country  Which he did control  And he did dominate  He would kill terrorists  Now it's a breeding ground  For terrorists  Do we know that?  Is there  Is that documented?  I'm going to guess  He's right  Simply because  He's probably afraid  They'd go after him  But he wouldn't have  Hated terrorists  Who are a target  Of the United States  Come on stop it  Well that's what  I want to know 
[03:00:30]  How does he know  How does he know  That info?  Let me tell you something  One danger  I'm not defending Bush  But the bottom line  Is he did have enough  Fucking access  To chemicals  And things like that  Don't think he wouldn't  Have given that  To somebody  Who was going to  Use it here  That's to be  The only danger he posed  Didn't like us  That's for sure  He hated us  To say the least  Although we should have  Let him keep Kuwait  And then take Saudi Arabia  That's the only reason  We went in  We don't give a fuck  About Kuwait  Gotta protect Saudi Arabia  Because they were next  Fucking lapdogs 
[03:01:00]  Of Saudi Arabia  That's all we are  We're a fucking  I saw like a 19 year old  Fresh out of college  We're afraid  Ah man we're all the  The government man  We really are  The government man  We are just a fucking  An arm of Saudi Arabia  It's disgusting  Well they really run the country  Everyone knows that  Well they got the earl  And they got a  You know  A lot invested in this country  And if they took  All their investments out  We'd be fine  We'd be fine  Chinese  That's what you gotta worry about  I read that in a book once  The Chinese are the ones  That have all our money  Well they're the ones  That are coming  The Chinese are on their way 
[03:01:30]  You know Chinese  Like have a lot of our cash  Just our liquid assets  A lot of American dollar bills  Are in the Chinese hands  It's kind of a little scary  No it's not  We'll just print more  Print more  Yeah  Let them have that  Who cares  You got a printer  Huh  We'll go over to your house  We'll start first  Everybody just to print  See the war protesters  All over the place  Over the weekend  Yeah  I  I  I  Tim Robbins  Take some chances  I hate the war protesters 
[03:02:00]  By the way  And not for the reason  That they're protesting the war  I was thinking to myself  Can I even hang with these people  Yeah  That's the problem  They're just strange people  In general  It has nothing to do  With their view of the war  I'm not even talking about  Their beliefs  And all that  Blah blah blah  It's the actual persons  I don't like them as people  They kind of look creepy  And just  I don't know  There's something about them  And their methods  I mean  Blocking traffic 
[03:02:30]  They were going to go down  To Wall Street today  I guess  And just screw up Wall Street  I think they were doing  Some things yesterday too  Yeah  Because I know  It took me forever  To get back in the city yesterday  Yeah  It's just  And it really isn't doing anything  I'm sorry  It's just not  People  People become aware  Of a war  Based on  Whatever  Their own knowledge  Things like that  You're not telling us anything new  Anything we all don't know  Kelly from Charlotte  Good for you Jim  You get 
[03:03:00]  You get at least a little  What Bush is doing  That's Bush  You fucking  It's every president  Do you think that started now?  Just because he's from Texas  And there's oil in Texas?

[03:20:00]  I mean where we are right now  It's only in  It's like 20 below  Exactly  That's with a wind chill  20 minutes of daylight  It just stinks  You get phone servers  In your igloo  Yes  Yes exactly  We all live in igloos  We all have walruses  Outside of our house  That's what I was saying  I know  That's why the place sucks  No that's not it at all  It's actually a beautiful place  In the summertime  In the summer  The summer's a couple of months long 
[03:20:30]  It gets nice and warm out here  It's not bad at all  We do have problems  That everybody else doesn't have  We can't get obviously good comedy  Isn't it night time right now  Isn't it already dark  Yes  Yeah  That's a great fucking place  It's 6.20 in the morning  Of course it's dark  No but it's going to be dark  For like  Till when  Fucking nine  Yeah  Yeah it stays dark there  It'll be dark for a while  It'll get lighter towards summertime 
[03:21:00]  But once we hit summertime  It actually gets up into the 70s  Oh  The 70s  Hey I hear you guys bitch all the time  Anyone on a pool business up there  Yeah right  Imagine I'm going to open a pool business  In Alaska  They have an indoor pool business  Up here  We've got plenty of indoor pools  We have no problem  Indoor pools  When we live up here  Of course they do  It's  I teach at a local school  We've only got 500 kids  We've got great kids  Who do a really good job  Eskimo kids  Are they all Eskimos  When was the last time you heard about anybody coming into school with a spear gun  Nobody does that in Alaska 
[03:21:30]  That's because no one in Alaska is worth killing  Are they all Eskimos  Absolutely not  Actually I don't even live in Alaska  You've been frunkist  Oh I knew he didn't know  I was just  I kept the line of questioning going  I was going to say the guy doesn't sound authentic  He got me I actually didn't know  Yeah  Yes  He had great kids  I had to like perk up a little sooner  Let's go to Cocksock  I wasn't buying his story  Cocksock  Hey  Hey boys 
[03:22:00]  What's up  I spent five years up in Alaska in the military and I've got two things for you guys  I got a little racial slur for the Alaska natives  They are known as clooches  And just to reinforce the fact that they will be drunk at negative ten in a snowbank in like January or February passed out  Of course they will  That's fucking believable  Clooches  And  Say again  They're called clooches  Yeah clooches  Yeah clooches  And another thing  The chicks up there 
[03:22:30]  In the cities there's ass loads of chicks  But in the interior it's a huge state  And if you put it over top of the U.S.  It'll go from Mississippi River west  And north south  But in the cities there's ass loads of chicks  And they're all free  Because Jimmy would love it  He would get his mule serviced every day  It's un-fucking believable  How would I get serviced?  I came from Ohio  Oh my god  It's ridiculous  Like I came from Ohio  And bitches up there want to get punched  They want to get beaten down  If you're a somewhat nice gentleman  You can take them out and just fuck all day long 
[03:23:00]  Wait a minute now  What's a good place  What are some of the cities besides Juneau?  Anchorage  I've never even been to Juneau  But Anchorage  They have a bar there  That's called Chilcoot Charlie's  Un-fucking believable  Like  I would go out  And  You were guaranteed to get some pussy  Every night  Yeah by what though?  Some fatso with a fucking  Big fat moon face  With those big fucking Eskimo face  And extra hair on their body  Going to the bathroom  You gotta stick your dick through a little  Fucking icy 
[03:23:30]  Ice wall  Glory hole  The chicks up there  Are pretty athletic  Because a lot of them  Like to snowboard  Ski  They might hunt and fish  You know there are some  Big old fucking  Berthas up there  But for the majority  You know when it gets dark  The bitches get crazy  And they wind up  Going out and tanning  And stuff  Because some people  Have to go through  Like light therapy  And shit  So they're all tan  Athletic  I mean the majority of them  Are  You know the ones that go out  There is some  Eeky weeky javas out there 
[03:24:00]  But  How big is Anchorage?  How many people?  There's like 80 people in Anchorage  There's like 500,000  But there's a couple suburbs there  That plus it up  But the thing is  The people that go out  Is a small community  Like when I went out  You know being in the military  I didn't really know  A lot of civilians  But everybody knew  My first name out there  And you know  It was great  We had a ball  I mean  What did you do wrong  That you were stationed  In fucking Alaska dude?  Oh uh  Actually I went up there  I was a paratrooper up there  We got to jump out of the planes 
[03:24:30]  Up there  It was nice  Alright how about this  I'm going to get scheduled  At a small theater in Anchorage  Hmm  I want to go do comedy in Anchorage  How do you think you'd do?  I don't know  Yeah let's do that  I think everybody would come out  Well they wouldn't  They wouldn't give a fuck  They'd be too drunk  Well that was it  Tonight we thought it was next week  Bah  Alright thank you cock sock  Yeah we got another one  Coming in from Chris  In Houston  Chris  Hey what's up boys  Hey  When I was in  When I was in training  I was stationed with two people  From Alaska  One of them was an Eskimo 
[03:25:00]  This motherfucker was an alcoholic  And he stunk like ass  The other guy  The white guy from Alaska  Was just a dumb shit  Anyway punch it out boys  Alright thanks for the info  More Trump on Bush  It's just very sad  I don't know if they're bad people  I don't know what's going on  I just know that they got us into a mess  The likes of which this country  Has probably never seen  It's one of the great catastrophes  Of all time  And perhaps even worse  The rest of the world hates us  You go throughout Europe 
[03:25:30]  I travel  I do deals all over the world  The Europeans hate us  You go to Germany  You go to England  You go to places that  You know we didn't have problems with  They all hate the Americans  Because of what's happened  We had a chance  After September 11th  To be the most popular  For the first time ever  To be the most popular nation on earth  And we blew it  Everybody  For the first time  People felt sympathy  I'm not saying it's a great thing  To have sympathy  In terms of yourself  But for the first time  They felt a sympathy  And a love  For this country 
[03:26:00]  Because of what happened  And we blew it  He raises a great point there  But about Europe hating us  Let's be honest  The Donald  The fucking Soviets falling  Contributed to the European  Little man complex  And I don't want to  Fucking hear it  They didn't hate us  When they were worried  About the Russians  They didn't fucking hate us  When we were keeping communism  We were the only ones  That were keeping them  From storming into  Fucking all of Europe  And just pulling an 8 off 
[03:26:30]  On all of them  Yeah so you're not right  About that  But he raises a great point man  We could have been  But  We're like 90%  We're 80% popular  You're right  You're right  But here's another thing  What would we do  What would have been  The follow up to 9-11  To keep that love  From all the other countries  And our own country  As fucking forgotten about  Not forgotten about 9-11  But really kinda  Not as loving to each other  As we were  Back five years ago or so 
[03:27:00]  So I think that would have  Worn off anyway  No matter what we did  The sympathy that we had  For 9-11  From the rest of the world  Would have worn off  A lot sooner than  It did with our own people  And what would have been  The  You know that was weird  My volume keeps going up  For no reason  What would have been  The thing to do  To make the world  Keep liking us  After 9-11  Well Afghanistan  Was originally the  Yeah that worked  But  We were fucking hearing  Grumblings as soon as  We started with Afghanistan 
[03:27:30]  Yeah  You can't go to Afghanistan  And he said  Believe me  The left was piping up  About that  They forget that  And now that Iraq  Is such a disaster  They go  Well  We didn't  You know  Afghanistan was the target  It's like you motherfuckers  When Afghanistan was the target  You complained about that  Yeah  You can't win  Nah  I say we kill  We just kill all non-whites  Oh boy  Jimmy we're not in the office  Yeah  We're on the air  Oh boy  Let's say hi to Tim  In Middletown  Tim  Middletown 
[03:28:00]  I just think  I just think that you guys  Showed your ignorance on this  And it's  Hold on Tim  Let's go slow  You have  You know  The ability to  Speak to a lot of people  We certainly do Tim  Slow down a bit  One point at a time  Alright  The first point I want to make is  Fuck this  Of course  No one from Middletown  Has anything smart to say  Shut up  It just makes sense  In that situation  Yeah sure  We should have 
[03:28:30]  Frankest  Trump on Bush  Some more  And Saddam Hussein  Will be a nice person  Compared to the man  And it will be a man  It will not be a woman  That we understand  People say  Oh gee  You didn't give the women a chance  It will be a man  Compared to the person  That takes over  For Saddam Hussein  He will be considered  A nice person  This guy will be  The meanest  The worst guy  And he'll have one thing  One thing  He will hate America  And he'll use that  To flame  Shut up  He's talking about  The guy that runs Iraq 
[03:29:00]  What  Is that what he's talking about  Okay  Yeah well  I think it ends up  We get some guy in there  Kind of likes the US  For five minutes  The second we move our troops out  There's a big coup  There's a civil war  And then some extremist  Gets in there  And it's just like Iran  Was with Shah  And the Ayatollah  Listen man  Thank you  Whoever gets in  They're going to want  A relationship with the US  Even that Iranian  Silly goose  Ah 
[03:29:30]  Wants to talk to the US  They all want to talk to us  So why don't you just  Cut the malarkey  Yeah  But unless there's  A religious extremist  That gets in there  Even they want to talk to us  Which they all are  Fucking over there  Let's say hi to Jerry in Philly  Jerry  Jerry  Hey boys how you doing  Alright Jerry  Donald Trump has a lot of credibility  Last Monday night  He was in the ring  With Vince McMahon  Signing some stupid contract  And he had a big Samoan guy  With his face painted  Around him  Yeah 
[03:30:00]  When  Once you end up  In a wrestling ring  Doing that shit  You pretty much lose  All credibility  Yeah  Donald is really pushing  He's everywhere  He is pushing  To publicize his show  That's not doing well  And finally the last bit  Trump on Bush  Everything in Washington  Has been a lie  Weapons of mass destruction  Was a total lie  It was a way of  Attacking Iraq  Which he thought 
[03:30:30]  Was going to be easy  And it turned out to be  The exact opposite of easy  He reads 60 books a year  He reads a book a week  That's  Do you think that's  Do you think the president  Reads a book a week  I don't think so  He  Doesn't watch television  Now one thing I know  Is that when I'm on television  I watch  Or I try  Because you do  Your own ego says  You know let's watch  Let's see whether it's good or bad  You want to watch  Right  He doesn't watch television  So he's on television  Being interviewed by you  Or somebody else  He doesn't watch  Does anybody really believe that
