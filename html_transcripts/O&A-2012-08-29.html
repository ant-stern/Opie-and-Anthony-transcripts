<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment featuring Chris Cornell as a guest.  The conversation revolved around Cornell's musical career, encompassing his work with Soundgarden, solo projects, and film scores for *Machine Gun Preacher* and *Casino Royale*. He discussed his songwriting process, vocal range, past struggles with substance abuse, and the impact of sobriety on his creativity.  He also shared a humorous anecdote about meeting Johnny Cash.  The discussion also included a comedic short film, "Cheat," by Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa, and Bob Kelly, its premiere, and the challenges of short film production.  The hosts and guests engaged in considerable banter, employing off-color jokes and insults.  A Chilean Eddie Vedder impersonator from *Mi Nombre Es* was briefly discussed, with a clip played on air.

The show continued with the hosts detailing their own film festival experiences, including their film's surprisingly positive reception at a festival, a humorous anecdote involving a bet and an impromptu dance, and technical discussions about film versus digital production.  They excitedly recounted their Tribeca Film Festival acceptance, emphasizing the competitive nature of the process.  A significant portion was dedicated to playing and critiquing a recording of Bobo's stand-up routine, with the hosts and callers offering harsh commentary on his performance.  The hosts announced Fez from the Ron and Fez show's coming out and name change to D-Man.  This transitioned into a discussion of personal experiences with armed robberies, with hosts and callers sharing their accounts and emotional responses. One host recounted a McDonald's robbery.

The next segment featured listener calls, including Robert's account of a Wendy's robbery and Charlie's discussion of bank silent alarm delays.  This led to a discussion of a viral McDonald's fight video, sparking a conversation about violence in fast food, changing demographics, McDonald's "365 Black" initiative, and childhood memories of McDonald's and fast food.  The hosts shared humorous stories, including one about a father throwing away a homemade marionette, and embarrassing adolescent experiences, including self-inflicted injuries, while discussing the song "Sometimes When We Touch."  A lengthy bit ensued about the distinction between "restaurants" and fast-food joints, peppered with listener calls.

Anthony then recounted humorous and reckless driving experiences with his father, who used the CB handle "Paisano Cowboy," describing his father's erratic driving while drinking and carrying a gun.  This led to a discussion of the absurdity and language of 1970s CB radio and various humorous handles, including Anthony’s own embarrassing childhood handle "Diamond Dust".  The conversation shifted to a song from *Convoy*, followed by a discussion of Opie's unusual masturbation habits and a call to Dr. Steve regarding a burning sensation after showering. Dr. Steve provided a scientific explanation.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Colin Quinn's Twitter feud with Will Ferrell, focusing on the media’s gullibility in reporting Quinn’s jokes as factual news.

The final segment featured Colin Quinn himself, who called in to clarify that his tweets about Will Ferrell were jokes and expressed disbelief at the media’s reaction.  A significant portion focused on a humorous, frustrating attempt to translate a Chilean news report about an Eddie Vedder sound-alike.  One host's poor Spanish skills were mocked extensively. The segment concluded with a humorous and offensive discussion of a host's reasons for disliking Puerto Rican women, focusing on stereotypes and cultural differences.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh my god.  What's going on?  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's stupid. Something ridiculously loud and obnoxious.  It's kind of like the best of Dallas Syndrome records.  We're never going to make everybody happy, so why do we have to now make more people not happy?  Oh no.  It's stupid.  It's audio vomit.  If I may use the word duty.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Chris, I gotta start. Earlier in the show, we played The Keeper before you got here.  That's excellent.  And fucking love the song. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you.  Me and Anne always talk about when you slow it down, you have just the most amazing voice.  Thank you.  And it's good to hear that.  Yeah, there's two things there.  You could either get the holy shit, Chris Cornell really fucking getting the range and screaming and sounding amazing.  But you could take it down and do a real soft song that is just...  Really shows off your rules too, man.  Touching. Quite touching.  I think there's a compliment in there somewhere.  Somewhere, yeah.  It's a little weird, right?  There's a confusion in there too.  I know, I know.  It's not your fault. 
[00:01:00]  I don't know what I'm saying.  It's something that I have done.  I saw Soundgarden.  I've created this in my life.  Nobody really knows.  It doesn't make a lot of sense.  But I don't know.  I just like music.  So whatever I like, I want to kind of go do sometimes.  Do you like Johnny Cash's cover?  I mean, I love his cover of Rusty Caged.  When you first heard that, did you like that?  Yeah, I did.  You did.  It baffled me a little, the concept.  But I learned a lot, which was you can take any song and kind of do whatever you want with it. 
[00:01:30]  And if it's a good song, it'll work out.  And he just took Rusty Caged, a Soundgarden song, which was this crazy against the wall riff.  And then just rearranged it.  So it went dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.  And then he sang Rusty Caged over it.  It was Johnny Cash.  It was great.  And then you're like, yeah.  He went dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.  It's like, what?  Which is really a stretch for Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  That whole thing.  He did his Johnny Cash thing.  But he turned me on to the song from Soundgarden.  Like, I heard Johnny Cash's first.  Oh, really? 
[00:02:00]  And then he got into Soundgarden.  Really?  Yes.  That's an odd thing.  I'm very anal about rock.  I listen to Sabbath and Kiss, and I feel disloyal if I like anything else.  Really?  I'm a complete creep.  He's obsessed with Sabbath.  If you like anything else, it's true.  Yeah, I'm stuck in the 70s.  But I got messages from people after Johnny Cash did Rusty Cage telling me how great the lyrics were.  And they never said that when they heard my version.  It was Johnny Cash sort of, I think, you listen to him more.  And he sold those words more than I did somehow.  I wonder why that is. 
[00:02:30]  I don't know.  I met him one time, and it was terrifying.  It's the only time I've really been scared to talk to another human being.  And when he spoke, the ground vibrated around you a little bit because the voice was really low.  And he was just a super intense guy.  But some people have that ability when they sing.  You just stop and pay attention to what you're saying.  How is it out with Soundgarden?  Everything fine?  Great.  Yeah.  We had a blast.  I went to the Jersey show.  Fucking amazing. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  It's fun.  It's really fun.  It's really loud still, man.  Really loud still.  That's good, though.  Because sometimes you see bands when they get back together again.  And it's like, fuck, man.  You know?  Yeah.  I remember this when it was loud.  Oh, they like to keep it loud.  And now I can talk to the person next to me.  No, it's not like that.  Yeah.  No.  You're not having conversations when you go to a Soundgarden show.  That would be weird, almost, I think, if you could hear anybody speak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That happens sometimes. 
[00:03:30]  It sucked.  I went to see, like, years, and this is years ago, I went to see Blue Oyster Cult when they got back together.  And I was able to lean over to my friend and go, yeah, this is ME262.  I'm glad they're doing this one.  And you're like, you never would have, your nose would have bled.  Turned that shit up, right?  Yeah, it was crazy.  That's what I like, though.  Still, yeah, Soundgarden, you're going to hear the volume.  The guys are all into it and shit, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all having a great time.  We tried to actually, you know, in the interest of not murdering our ears, getting tinnitus, 
[00:04:00]  and we tried to back off the volume a little bit this time.  We were talking, you know, we were rehearsing a lower volume.  Try that out.  And it just, everybody sort of reaches and turns up slowly at different times across the stage.  And then it starts playing louder.  And then at some point, it's the way it always was.  The first person you usually see is the guitarist to go over and go, like, do, do, do.  Just a little bit.  Just touch to get his lead up a little bit.  And then the bass player's like, well, Fadimenda's gone.  Let me go up here.  And then the drummer's fucking just pounded and tried to play a little louder. 
[00:04:30]  And then Chris is screaming.  Yeah.  And after 10 a little bit, you know, it's...  That's the way you know it.  It's insane.  Are your ears shot?  No, my ears are pretty good.  But after some of these shows in the summer, I definitely was hearing bells and...  Oh, you don't do the plugs?  No.  It's all his hair.  I do it sometimes, but I don't, no.  Okay.  No.  Yeah.  You don't hear that...  Yeah, I hear that.  That whistling sound, man.  Or sometimes it's just like...  In the middle of the night, it wakes me up.  But it goes away.  Do you have to... 
[00:05:00]  In a while, it does.  Do you have to go to sleep with like something on?  Like a TV or...  No.  Thank God.  I hope that doesn't happen.  I have friends that do that.  Yeah, like you just...  You have to have a fan or something.  Yeah, something.  Someone in the room telling you you rule.  I don't say that.  That's like what an idiot I am.  I'm all right, though, man.  Oh, that stunk.  No, it was kind of cute.  What's the solo tour all about?  What are we going to hear?  I don't know.  I usually don't do set lists for that.  Oh, you're just...  But I do like whatever I want from any period. 
[00:05:30]  You just kind of make it up as you go?  Yeah.  You never get somebody yelling, you know,  Do Stonehenge!  Yeah, I do say...  If you yell it, I'll probably try it.  Give it a whirl, yeah.  That's sort of part of what's fun about it.  Because with a band, especially a loud band,  it's hard to communicate.  And it's like, you know, let's do this song  because someone brought a sign.  That kind of thing.  Right.  It's like, when I'm alone, I can just do it.  What songs have you tried?  Well, songs that I haven't ever really tried to play acoustically, 
[00:06:00]  I've tried before.  I remember someone yelled out Fourth of July  for a Soundgarden song,  which is sort of ridiculous to even try on an acoustic.  And I started to try to bang that out and sing it.  And then, you know,  people usually will come up with just dumb ideas,  like, you know, if it's an acoustic guitar,  they'll be screaming Jesus Christ pose.  I don't know if you think they're funny or whatever,  but it sounds a little like bluegrass, though,  if you try to play it on a good thing. 
[00:06:30]  I really think it's just people hoping.  You know, please play that.  And it's like, no, dude.  Yeah, they just want to hear it,  and they think maybe you can make it sound like  it's virtually impossible.  You don't know how hard that is to do, right?  You cannot do that.  What kind of covers do you do, I guess,  what I was asking, too?  I don't know anything I can think of.  When I was in Jersey, I did a couple Springsteen songs.  That went over good.  It always does.  You know, you're in Jersey,  you play Springsteen, it works.  Yeah, you're pretty safe.  That's a safe bet with that one.  Do you remember seeing Anthony in California? 
[00:07:00]  You're an ass.  I'm making sure you're members.  Oh, at the hotel?  Yeah, yeah, we were at the Beverly Hills.  You were getting your house painted.  No, I think my house flooded.  Oh, yeah, something.  You were getting it fixed or something.  But it was kind of cool,  because everybody sees Chris on stage,  fucking epitome of the rock star,  and he's there saying what this kid's like,  hey, don't splash over there.  It's like seeing the dad, Chris Cornell, 
[00:07:30]  was kind of an odd, out-of-place,  but very cool thing,  because you came across,  I don't know,  you could be the worst father in the world,  but you came across as a great dad,  like really attentive and stuff,  but it was the weirdest thing to see in real life.  It was completely out of context.  Hey, yeah, oh, yeah, look,  he's swimming,  they're riding on his back,  and it's like, hey.  He's being a father.  Black Hole Sun guy.  Did the kids ask who he was?  Like, who's the man with no shirt  and a beer in each hand  talking way too loud for this hotel? 
[00:08:00]  All right, shut up.  I do like that cabana service over there.  Yeah.  It is very, very nice.  No, I, uh,  did you, uh,  did somebody,  I read on something,  did you, um,  did you stop drinking  in like 2000 or something?  I think it was 2002.  Was there one of those big reasons  or just kind of a,  bleh, let me get it.  I don't remember any of the reasons.  That's probably why.  Well, about the,  about the five or six  surrounding years  to be honest.  Oh, okay.  Um,  maybe that. 
[00:08:30]  But I'm glad I stopped drinking.  Like, I'm,  I'm, uh,  I feel like I,  I get a lot more done.  Were you,  were you afraid creatively?  Like, uh,  No, I was never anyone  that could,  I could never write anything,  um,  drunk or high on it.  It's never worked.  Really?  I would try,  but it would be awful.  Like if I,  especially if I wrote lyrics  and then,  you know,  the next morning  I would read it,  I would immediately burn it.  I didn't want anyone  to ever even see it.  Wow.  Yeah, I was horrible at that.  Because some people  are really good at that 
[00:09:00]  and then, you know.  No, I've heard that story,  but I remember  I was in rehab  and there were,  there were people saying,  so, you know,  it's going to be very difficult  for you to transition  into being creative  when you're not loaded.  And I'm,  no, not for me.  Um,  coffee was the only thing  that ever worked for me,  which still works.  Oh, for it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, coffee rules.  I, when I would drink,  I think creatively,  like the best thing  I could do was,  you know,  kind of get into this long,  really bad blues jam.  Drunken guys get into it  so you can really put up  with that 
[00:09:30]  and have the attention  span for it.  Um,  which is really depressing.  So, you know,  that's all over.  Um.  Can you sit down  and say,  I'm going to write right now,  I need to write,  or is it just kind of like  you wake up at three  in the morning  with lyrics  or,  or a riff?  I think both those  things happen.  Um,  and probably to anybody  that,  that writes anything,  probably both those  things happen.  At some point,  you'll end up in a position  where you have to sit down  and,  and you have no ideas  and you've got to write 
[00:10:00]  something.  It's like,  God,  I told these people  this would be ready,  you know.  Oh,  like a deadline or something.  That's got to be a little  bit of pressure,  yeah.  like in a,  with a band,  um,  like working with  Soundgarden,  there's a lot of  co-writing scenarios  where,  um,  you know,  I'm going to  take your song home  and work on it  and then come back  and we'll have something.  Mm.  And,  you know,  it's a,  you can't necessarily  wait for lightning  to strike.  I always feel like  that's the best way  to go though,  just wait around  until I just pop in. 
[00:10:30]  Until something,  yeah.  Um,  with,  with the Keeper,  was,  was that written  specifically for the movie?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Uh,  what's the movie?  Uh,  Machine Gun Preacher?  Machine Gun Preacher,  yeah.  Machine Gun Preacher.  So,  do you find that harder  to,  uh,  write something  on a subject  like,  here's a movie,  hey,  write this,  because like I,  I told you last time  you were on the,  uh,  the Casino Royale,  uh,  opening theme  is,  is fantastic.  Uh,  I,  I love it as just  a regular song,  not even as a,  a movie theme.  Well,  thank you.  Is it harder to, 
[00:11:00]  to say,  hey,  here's a movie,  here's what the movie's about,  or?  Well,  I guess,  you know,  with the,  with an entire film,  you know,  and a script and a story,  something like the Keeper,  where,  um,  it's based on,  um,  the Machine Gun Preacher  who's a real guy  and it's his real life  and the scope of his life  is really crazy  and,  uh,  you know,  it's like,  he goes from meth head biker  to born again Christian  to guy that,  that,  uh,  builds an orphanage  in like a,  uh,  a demilitarized zone 
[00:11:30]  in,  in,  uh,  South Sudan  and he likes to shoot people  but,  but he's a humanitarian  and,  like,  there's a lot to go on  to write a song with that.  Yeah,  that's kind of true.  Yeah,  a lot of,  a lot of material there.  But it's also not,  like,  it's,  it's for a film,  it's,  it's a collaboration  with people making a movie  and a screenwriter  and,  and so the,  I can't just do  whatever I want  in a sense that has to fit.  So they do have input  on the song itself?  Well,  I get pretty lucky  most of the time  when I've been in situations  like that,  um,  I'm good enough to, 
[00:12:00]  they just like it.  Yeah,  yeah,  they just like it.  I've also had the other,  where,  yeah,  I'm not sure if that works  or I'm not sure if we like it,  but the,  usually things just go well.  Yeah.  I think if you try.  You really,  you know,  give it a whirl.  Yeah,  just try to do a good job  and it usually works out.  Do they tell you  if they want it to be acoustic  or heavy  or they just kind of  leave all that up to you?  Pretty much left  all that up to me on this.  And,  and with Machine Gun Preacher  it was hard  because the,  there's sort of like  this period of,  of,  uh,  earlier in his life 
[00:12:30]  that's kind of like  maybe biker rock,  70s,  and then,  um,  then,  there,  I could have approached it  from a gospel oriented thing  when he,  when he's sort of  becoming this preacher  but then the,  um,  there's African music,  uh,  Sudanese choir,  there's hip hop  and,  um,  there's all these different,  uh,  periods in the story  where different kinds of music  could fit in  and somehow or another  I ended up with  just an acoustic guitar  and singing  I don't know.  You look at everything 
[00:13:00]  and go,  it's just too much shit here.  Let me grab a guitar.  Are you actually  singing the movie plot  or no?  You're not singing about the,  are you singing something  that fits it thematically  or actually what goes on  in the movie?  my approach was like,  because,  you know,  I don't know what it's like  to,  to be,  uh,  one of the children  that the story's about  or,  or,  uh,  Sam Childers  and,  you know,  I'm not him  so I didn't have those experiences  so I ended up kind of  approaching it like  what if,  what if Sam Childers  were Woody Guthrie  and he was writing a song 
[00:13:30]  about this situation  and the,  and the plight of these kids  and his dedication to,  to,  uh,  risking his life  to just make sure  they're safe  and that's where the idea  came from.  Yeah,  because that,  that,  that to me is the,  is the hard part  is capture,  because I know I would just,  I'm not a songwriter,  but I know I would just write  like scene by scene  and just,  you know,  make it all hacky  and stupid.  And then the man got on the plane,  you know,  just,  your song would be 90 minutes long.  It would be awful.  It would be literal dialogue  from the movie.  Just audible.  And he ducked in,  I thought he was shot,  but he was fine. 
[00:14:00]  And we'd be like,  this stinks.  You were,  you were,  uh,  I guess a big part of the,  uh,  the Pearl Jam movie.  You said the documentary.  Yeah.  In the,  in the,  uh,  documentary.  Yeah.  Uh,  Cameron Crowe,  uh,  film.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which was great.  He did a,  he did an amazing job  and it's,  um,  it's,  it's a great,  it's a great documentary  for fans  because I feel like,  you know,  when you really kind of  get to see behind the curtain  a little bit  and everybody's personality 
[00:14:30]  comes across very genuine  and,  and then it's a Cameron Crowe film  which,  he's,  he's a guy that was  a music journalist  from the time he was,  I don't know,  15 or 14.  Um,  and then,  so he was interviewing  Led Zeppelin  when he was,  15  and then he became  an accomplished movie maker  so he put those two things together  and,  it,  it,  it's really an entertaining film.  It's great.  Yeah,  Ron Travis here  is a,  a giant,  uh, 
[00:15:00]  Pearl Jam fan  so,  he won't shut the fuck up  about it.  Got a lot of Pearl Jam fans here.  No,  I know,  it's,  I fucking love Pearl Jam.  It's amazing.  I can't wait to see this thing.  You should,  you should actually show Chris  the Mexican guy  or the Chilean guy.  Did you see the Chilean guy yet?  Have you seen this Chilean guy?  The Chilean guy  that sings,  someone get on the,  it's really quick.  He does yellow lead better.  Really?  Travis,  I thought I saw Travis.  Even for 30 seconds  you gotta see this.  It's ridiculous.  It's a show called,  uh,  My Name Is,  but it's in, 
[00:15:30]  uh,  Mi Nombre Es.  Yeah,  Mi Nombre Es,  out of Chile.  Out of Chile.  And they get these people  and they dress up,  uh,  as much as they can,  uh,  as,  as,  uh,  somebody,  a singer.  and,  and they get up and sing  as best they can  in the style of.  And most of them  are pretty goofy  and they can't speak English  so they're just speaking phonetically.  A bunch of them are,  they're off,  you can tell.  And this guy's like,  Mi Amma Es,  Eddie Vedder.  Right.  And he starts singing  and I was like,  at first,  I swear to you,  I was like,  wait,  no,  this is bullshit.  They fucking, 
[00:16:00]  yeah.  They like overdubbed this thing  on here.  Here he is.  I'll be heard the ears.  You got the headphones?  He needs some ears.  Mi Nombre Es,  Eddie Vedder.  Eddie Vedder.  It's like a sort of a contest too.  Yeah.  Queremos ver a Eddie Vedder  en este escenario.  Mucha suerte.  I thought he was lying.  On the ceiling  On a person that I'm  Oh my God,  that's pretty lame.  I swear,  I thought they were.  And there's some listening  and getting ready to judge it. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That would be worth doing  at an actual Pearl Jam show  just for a minute.  I know, right?  And just see everybody  look confused and upset.  And upset.  The guy is doing  an amazing job.  That's pretty crazy.  And this is what they'll do  if Eddie Vedder leaves Pearl Jam,  they'll just fucking  cart this guy out  the way they did  in Journey.  Like Journey.  Yeah, you can hit it.  That's just...  Isn't that wild?  When I first saw it,  I was like,  come on,  they friggin...  They over-dolled or something. 
[00:17:00]  Some goofy guy  found this show clip  and popped friggin Pearl Jam  on top of it.  You ever find anyone  that does you  real well, Chris?  No, you know,  I've had people  send me stuff.  Hey, Chris,  I sound just like you.  Check it out.  Do ya?  There'll be like  just a moment  where I kind of hear it  but most of the time  I don't hear it.  Well, over the years  you gotta realize  without the pat  on your own back  that you've got  a pretty good voice,  good range. 
[00:17:30]  I think I do a lot of stuff  so it's hard...  I remember  Timmy C from Rage  used to say  that he didn't really know  where home base was  for my voice.  There's no real...  Yeah, like if you're writing...  Oh, that's what he does  all the time.  Or if you're writing  for your range, yeah.  And I think that comes  from songwriting.  Whatever it is,  I just kind of want to hear  the singer that's gonna  sound right.  And so I never paid  much attention to range.  Yeah.  It would be like,  oh, I want to hear  that melody  and it would be 
[00:18:00]  whatever key the song was in  and then that would  just be it.  So many singers  want to punch you  in the face right now  that you just say that  like, I never thought  about range.  Right.  Like some people  are just like,  I'd love to be able  to hit that note  and it's just like,  nah, he could just hit it.  Not from that.  There's on the job training  like the several years  of, you know,  like the early years  of Soundgarden.  We joined,  started in 1984.  Jesus.  So it was a while  of really being in a band  and playing shows  and doing it. 
[00:18:30]  I definitely,  I had very little range  when I started.  Really?  Yeah.  You were able to  crank it up?  Holy shit.  Man, that is amazing.  And then over the years,  how do you take care of it?  Do you have to?  Well, it helps not  to drink and smoke.  Oh, well.  That makes it easier.  Does it?  Other than that,  yeah.  It's all the obvious things,  really.  It's just the obvious things,  you know.  You can't drink like a fish,  smoke cigarettes,  or weed. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, and you can a little bit,  but like a lot doesn't work.  Yeah.  For much, really.  I mean,  there's not a whole lot  you can do.  You can shoot pool  or play shuffleboard.  You can get those things done.  You can do a lot of sports.  When you're in a band  and you're out doing solo stuff,  do other band members  get resentful?  Like,  whoever's out doing  the solo stuff,  whether it's a singer  or the guitarist,  do they start to feel like,  almost like,  you're leaving the relationship  to do this?  Well,  with Soundgarden,  everybody always did stuff. 
[00:19:30]  I mean,  Matt and I did  Temple of the Dog in 1990,  and,  you know,  I think that was sort of  a testament to  just the trust  that we had  inside of the band,  that it's okay  to go out  and do other stuff,  and know that you're  kind of safe  in your band  and everyone's secure,  and the fact that  this is what everybody,  you know,  is dedicated to,  all the time.  Is there ever a time  where the band  wants to do something, 
[00:20:00]  but you're like,  oh,  no,  the solo stuff's booked.  I can't,  I can't.  Not really.  You try to work it out,  I would imagine,  right?  Not really.  I think at this stage  of being in Soundgarden,  it's kind of good  that everybody's doing  other things,  because...  A break is healthy,  I would assume.  Well,  I like to be  really,  really,  really busy,  and I think that,  you know,  to have that,  to have that  all sort of  fall on the shoulders  of Soundgarden  probably isn't  that great of a thing.  I think for us 
[00:20:30]  to be able to  do what we do  with a more relaxed pace  and not have,  like,  two-year projections  of what our schedule's  going to be  and release dates  before we've written  any songs  for a record,  that never really  worked for us.  Why didn't you guys  go back to the  Temple of the Dog thing?  Hmm?  Why didn't you go back  to the Temple of the Dog thing?  It was 1990,  and you guys  had some magic there.  Another album or something.  You were in separate bands  that were really busy.  Yeah.  But there was never  time in the last, 
[00:21:00]  what,  it's been 20 years now  to get back  and try to do  something else with that.  I don't know,  maybe because of the fact  that it was something  that it took  a couple of weeks  to do it  and then it was  very special  and it surrounded  kind of a subject  that was sort of  important to us  being that it was  a tribute to our friend  that died  and I'm not sure  if it necessarily  would have felt natural  to like,  at least, 
[00:21:30]  you know,  to go back  and write other songs  or record it.  It would be fun  to play shows  or something  and play the songs more  because we've only done  every six years or so  somehow something  will happen  when we get together  and play.  Have you noticed  a big change  in personality-wise  because you guys  were kids  when Soundgarden  originally  and now you're  men, guys?  Have you noticed  huge personality changes  in some of the guys  where you're like,  wow,  that guy's really changed? 
[00:22:00]  I feel like with everybody,  you know,  even other guys  in Seattle bands  that I grew up with,  everybody's pretty similar  to the way  they always were.  I just sort of see  everyone being  a little less goofy  and having more patience,  I think.  That's just growing up  that you're not  anybody, yeah.  It doesn't necessarily  have to do with  where you're from.  I think doing solo stuff too,  it's got to be resentful  when there's four people  creatively collaborating  or five people.  It's got to be annoying 
[00:22:30]  to have someone's ideas  always overriding yours  or the one guy  with the shit idea  that everybody  has to politely listen to.  At least you can go out  and do it  and it gets out of the system  so there's no one  just resenting the fact  that their ideas  can't be,  I guess,  made real  or brought to fruition  as we say.  Yeah, I think  that's sort of where  side projects  from bands  usually come  because the people,  you know,  it's not always  going to make sense  that something  one guy in a band  is going to want to do  doesn't work 
[00:23:00]  for the band  and maybe it's just,  you know,  there's a lot of things  I've done  since the beginning  of Soundgarden  that didn't necessarily  make sense for Soundgarden  and it wouldn't fit  and I think that's  where those side projects  come from  most of the time  with any band.  He had a great song  and I don't remember  the name of the song  but it was on Slash's record  which was really good.  Yeah, it was fun.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, that was an amazing album.  Did you write that  or did he write that  and did he ask  to come in for it?  He wrote the guitar parts  and I just kind of took that  and wrote to it, really, 
[00:23:30]  and responded with emails  of MP3s.  Oh, God, just back and forth.  Yeah, we were in the studio  the day that I came in  to sing it  and it was, you know,  it was the final version  of the music  but initially it was just  the demo that he sent me  via email  and then I recorded over it  and sent it via email back  which is weird  but, you know.  The future.  Strangely, it works. 
[00:24:00]  What do you do?  How do you tell somebody  if they're sending you ideas  that are just atrocious?  Like, even if it's a guy  you respect  and he's like saying,  oh, no, maybe you should sing this  and you're like, ugh.  You go dark  for a really, really  unreasonably long time.  Send him back corrupted files.  Yeah, I'm trying.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  Yeah, you get emails  that are just question marks  like, where are you?  Right.  You just ignore it.  Yeah, you don't actually say  like that was hard.  You just actually come back  with something that's better  and just go,  here's what I got.  I didn't see that.  No, you just ignore it. 
[00:24:30]  Just ignore it.  Yeah.  When you write so much,  you've written a lot of songs.  Do you start feeling like  have you ever written anything  where you've looked at  and gone,  wait a minute,  I've done that before.  God.  I can see I want to be redundant.  I've actually done stuff twice  where I'll realize  this was an idea I already had  and maybe I just didn't record it.  But what's way worse than that  is I'll get some melody in my head  and think that it's really great 
[00:25:00]  and then realize  it's someone else's song.  Exactly.  To a T.  Sounds good for a minute, right?  Yeah.  All that glitters is gold.  I've heard that.  This is really hooky.  The Beatles did this.  This is so catchy.  I love it.  It's going to be great.  I don't know what.  It's like as though  I've heard it before.  Oh, shit.  Guys, I got it.  I saw her standing there.  Like a virgin.  Yeah.  I don't know why I like that.  I think it's a great idea.  I think it might go over big  with the kids.  Will you just scrap the idea 
[00:25:30]  or will you like go,  all right,  because maybe you added  a little bit to it  and you don't realize  that you got the basic  foundation from somewhere else.  Will you scrap the whole idea  and just go,  fuck it, I can't  or will you just build on it?  Yeah, if it's exactly  something else.  I think like a lot of the time  you can play me  in kind of any song  and I might be able  to tell you two or three things  that have similar notes  or are similar.  But if that happens,  that's okay.  But if it's just one thing,  it's kind of a carbon copy 
[00:26:00]  of somebody else's song.  And it happens.  It's amazing how it goes.  I haven't really heard  Soundgarden at least  be guilty of something like that.  That's because  there's quality control  in places.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not going to get to you.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody's going to say,  that sounds exactly like  blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, the song's never  going to make the show.  You're like, no way.  You play it and go,  shit, it is.  The song's not going  to make the album.  You've got to have people  like that around you, though.  Like Lady Gaga,  who I like,  got a lot of shit 
[00:26:30]  because that one song  sounded like Madonna,  a lot like Madonna.  And nobody around her  probably,  because she's solo,  said to her,  you can't do that.  It sounds just like,  you know,  Madonna in a band.  At least you can call  each other out  and go,  what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, what are you doing?  That's true.  That's what's great  about a band.  That's what creates  the identity of the band.  That's what sort of  serves the fans.  You can't do,  you can't take  hard right turns  if you're in a band  that's truly democratic.  You can't go hard  to the right 
[00:27:00]  or hard to the left  because you've got  a bureaucracy  that's going to  sort of slow that down  at least a little bit.  Would you guys ever  work with Black Sabbath?  Like on the road  or something?  That'd be great.  Obviously,  I played a show  with Black Sabbath  in Germany  and it was unbelievable.  Wow.  I guess it would have been  like five years ago.  At Ozfest?  No, it was just  like a German festival  and we played  and then they came out  and it was really incredible. 
[00:27:30]  I was blown away.  Everybody was great.  The only thing  that was a little weird  was that the drummer  had an actual guy  crouched down  beside the hi-hat  using his fingers  to count off measures  and beats  to the guy  so it would be  sort of one,  two,  and then two  so he always  kind of knew  where he was.  He didn't really  look at the guy  but the guy was there  in case he needed  to look at the guy.  That's really odd.  I think Bill Ward's Bill Ward.  I wonder if his hearing 
[00:28:00]  is going a little bit.  I don't know.  Probably with a click  or something.  Maybe he just got lost.  I mean,  it can happen I guess  over time  where you sort of  Wow.  Your mind can wander  but he didn't  Your mind can wander.  He never seemed  to need it  but the guy  was there for him.  I don't understand  what that one,  two,  three,  how would that help  during a song?  I'm not musically inclined.  If you get lost  in the song,  yeah,  I would probably  just look down  and keep the beat  to the guy's fingers  and regardless  of what you're hearing  you know you're on.  You're doing your part.  They were so good. 
[00:28:30]  It was really incredible.  That's when you stop  and go,  yeah,  that's how you do it.  That's how the real guys  do it.  Have you noticed  Ozzy's voice sounds  a lot better now?  It's weird.  I think he quit drinking.  He sounds like a lot healthier  now than he did  five years ago.  Something about that.  I don't know.  Yeah.  If you pause  and like look  at certain things  I don't know.  I always felt like  he was just sort of  uniquely him  so I've always  liked his voice  live. 
[00:29:00]  I always felt like  he did a great job.  Yeah,  even when it cracks  it's still fun.  He's still Ozzy.  He forgets the fucking  worst over the mountain  30 seconds into the show.  Who cares?  He would do that.  He would just start  singing the last verse  first and nobody  gave a shit.  It just worked.  Chris,  thanks man.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure  talking to you.  Thank you.  You're listening to the  worst of the O.P.  Anthony Show.  It's the worst of the  O.P.  Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Bill Burr,  Joe DeRosa, 
[00:29:30]  Bob Kelly.  You might hear in the  background Bill Burr  saying,  talking about his movie  Cheat.  CheatTheMovie.com.  Can they just go to  CheatTheMovie.com  for movie time?  I think they're sold out  except for Thursday.  I think every show  sold out.  Why only 15 minutes?  It's a short film.  It's a short.  It's a short.  Hence the name.  We don't have a million  to make a long.  Yeah,  we don't have.  This is how you get in.  You make a short one.  All right,  calm down.  15 minutes worth of money.  That's a good question.  I was talking to Anne 
[00:30:00]  about this.  Could this possibly lead  to a longer version  of this film?  Yeah.  Yeah,  like a lot of films  I've done.  Like Sling Blade.  I heard Meet the Parents  was like that.  The guy made a short one,  they liked it,  and then turned it  into a long movie  and then attached  a bunch of size.  Well,  actually,  The Fockers,  Meet the Fockers  was actually a short  intro.  That's what he just said.  He just said that.  He started with  Meet the Parents, Bob.  You said Meet the Parents,  right?  Which was the first one.  That was the first one.  They didn't start  with the third movie  of the trilogy.  You guys could have  corrected me  when I told you that  fucking two days ago.  It's just fun  hearing you say shit wrong.  I hate that. 
[00:30:30]  I'm the one  who told him that.  He just fucking  threw it off  as his knowledge.  Yeah,  but you fucked up  because you didn't  listen to what he just said.  He didn't tell me  I sucked two days ago.  You should have  jumped right in  from the beginning  and said Meet the Parents.  You said Meet the Fockers.  You said the wrong thing.  We all do it sometimes.  And you literally said it  right after he said it.  I can't defend myself.  Showing that you weren't  listening at all.  Absolutely.  I'm a fucking...  Good buzz in the movie,  though.  Fucking do me.  Yeah,  so we'll see what happens.  We have a feature-length script  based on this 
[00:31:00]  written already,  basically,  so we're hoping  to try to sell it.  Because that's what  everybody told us.  You're going to go there  and if people like it,  they don't just go,  oh, that was great.  They go,  we loved it.  What else you got?  And then you've got  to have something  to hand them right away.  And people are liking this,  right?  So far.  Joe went to the first one  on Saturday night.  We weren't there.  We were on the road.  But he was at the premiere  on Saturday.  Yeah,  I was at the premiere  of our first movie  we ever did  at De Niro's Festival.  These fucking guys  were in Poughkeepsie.  Why wouldn't you go to that? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah,  wouldn't you just  blow the gig off?  First of all,  because we could get gigs.  Oh,  see, Joe.  Oh, damn.  We had to pay  called mortgages.  Yeah,  and also,  yeah,  my gigs,  I already sold  all the fucking tickets.  I know.  I was just making a joke.  He's such a cunt.  I was just making a joke.  He always tries  to make himself  like he's more responsible.  You probably fingered  an 80-year-old  when you should have  been talking to a producer,  you creep.  Oh,  they got you,  Joe.  They got me.  Oh, 
[00:32:00]  they got me.  What's the gist?  A couple of zingers.  What's the gist  of the movie?  We can't say too much  with...  Well,  not in 15 minutes.  Well,  there's a left turn.  We don't want to give it away,  but it's basically  three pieces of shit  get together  to combine  their piece of shitness  to try to accomplish  a goal.  It's about...  We try to pull off  the perfect heist.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  And there's a character  named Doc.  There's a time machine  made out of a DeLorean.  That's cool. 
[00:32:30]  The guy goes back.  There's a lot of cool shit  going on.  It starts off,  you think it's a serious movie,  then there's a left turn,  then it...  All right.  Yeah,  and it's 3D.  Are you...  Oh,  wow.  You at the premiere?  Yes,  I went.  Were you sitting in the audience  when they were showing this thing?  Yeah.  And?  It killed.  It was great.  I was really...  Actually...  You know,  I don't want to say surprised,  like I didn't believe in the movie,  but I was surprised  at how good of a reaction it got.  I was really,  really excited about it.  I couldn't have...  Dude,  even if I was there,  I couldn't have sat.  Just the level of powerlessness.  Because as a comedian, 
[00:33:00]  if it's not going well,  you couldn't judge,  what the fuck is wrong with you people?  Like,  blame the crowd.  Right, right.  But the film is just done.  It's there.  And if it's bombing,  there's just nothing you can do  but slide under your seat.  Bill just runs up to the screen.  Hey,  motherfuckers!  Fuck you!  Yeah, yeah.  It's gorgeous.  Yeah.  It's good.  I did that.  Dane,  we did the Eight Guys premiere  and he showed an animation  that he did before  the actually Eight Guys.  It fucking tanked.  Yeah.  Oh,  there's nothing worse 
[00:33:30]  than being in a room full of fucking no laughs.  Oh,  just this cartoon  and watching a cartoon at that.  Good thing he could dab his eyes  with $100 bills.  Get it?  I was nervous.  Oh,  shit.  Wow.  Wow.  He's found most of it,  hasn't he?  Oh,  boy.  He's talked about it on the show.  Why are you looking at me?  I didn't even get that  for half a second.  Oh,  yeah.  I just,  you know,  you don't get a joke.  You just look around  trying to read people's face.  What was the subtext? 
[00:34:00]  A little inside,  but some people know  what that's about.  I was a deaf person  on a comedy show.  So,  you guys might have something here.  We'll see what happens.  We'll see,  you know,  we're hoping for the,  hoping for the best,  but you know,  you don't want to get your hopes  too high up.  Because what do you do  with this film  if it doesn't become  a longer feature?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  That's a cold bucket  of water of reality.  We're still in fantasy land here.  But isn't that a real question?  Saturday when you're lonely?  Hey guys,  check out this.  Here's something  that we thought  would change our lives. 
[00:34:30]  Oh,  damn.  Oh,  damn.  Fucking 90 comments  from shit dicks.  Go fuck yourself.  You sucked.  All right,  thanks.  You know what?  I'm actually willing to bet.  I'm willing to bet.  Even some of the bigger cunts  that listen to this show  will actually enjoy it.  Yeah.  I think we did a good job.  We're going to send it  to more festivals  after this one.  And you know,  you just hope that  at one of these things  something will happen.  But that's the reality.  You really,  it has to be longer  for it to be successful  for you guys,  right?  Yeah.  In all fairness,  you know,  the short has opened, 
[00:35:00]  you know,  other doors.  You know,  it's like,  it's like,  you know,  we wrote this book  that we have coming out  that you guys  were involved in  for those interviews  we did.  And you know,  so that'll be coming out  next year.  So that was,  and you can get,  the movie will be  in the back of the book.  Yeah.  So really?  And it will be available  and download for like iTunes.  If you buy the book,  you'll be able to get the movie.  So at the very least,  we got that.  Yeah.  And also too,  like who came up  with this idea?  With what?  With the story for the film?  Yeah.  It was basically a true, 
[00:35:30]  sort of a true thing  that happened to me.  And Bobby and I  were talking about  in the diner  and Bobby said,  let's do this  as the short film.  Bill had the idea  that we should do  a short film  and then we were like,  all right,  let's think of something.  And Bobby and I  were talking in the diner  one day  and I was telling him  this jam I was in.  And Bobby went,  we should do this  as our movie idea.  We called Bill  and he was like,  this is an old woman involved.  You know.  Yeah.  Great.  A couple old broads  are involved.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Make out session  with an old bag. 
[00:36:00]  I've known about this movie  for a while now  and I still don't know  what the fuck it's about  because of the left turn.  Well, you were going to  come down on Saturday, right?  You almost made it  but then because you forgot  it was Easter weekend.  Yeah, which we thought  was amazing  as a married man  with a child.  You had no idea  it was Easter.  That's amazing.  That's amazing.  You should have used  a better one, man.  Yeah.  You didn't buy any candy.  Is this weekend Easter?  I had no idea.  He's probably standing  in a bunny rabbit soup.  That's one of the worst  excuses we got.  I've never supported you fuckers.  He can't even look at us.  Look at us. 
[00:36:30]  He's looking away.  I wanted to go.  My wife is painting whiskers  on his face  with odd lines.  I was trying to figure out  how I could do that.  I kind of had  something else I could do.  I wanted to go.  Definitely.  You've come out  to all our shows.  You're with me with the jokes  but I did want to go.  But we do have to  break your balls  a little bit with that.  Is there another screen  I could go to?  He's trying to move  the ball forward.  That's good.  You didn't even go  to the premiere.  I don't need to.  That's a good point.  You got a good point.  So why am I supposed  to go if you weren't there?  Yeah, but I said  I didn't go to the premiere  because I have a gig 
[00:37:00]  in Milwaukee  in Detroit.  I didn't say  I had no idea  it was this major hole.  I had a gig in Philly  with the fucking Easter Bunny.  It is hilarious.  It is.  Oh, dude.  I was going to visit you  in the hospital  but I forgot  until today  it was my birthday.  I had no fucking idea.  Oh, shit.  You know me.  Always forgetting stuff.  Sitting there  with a party hat on  frosting on the side  of his face.  So Joe's the only one  there, right?  Yes.  So you're busting my balls  but you weren't going  to be there  and you weren't going  to be there. 
[00:37:30]  We couldn't.  We're not giving you shit  for not being there.  We're just saying  you should have just said  I can't make it.  It's not like we did  the movie periods  from 6.30 a.m.  to 10.30 a.m.  Monday through Friday.  That would be  a different story.  Saturday night for you  was pretty much  a night off.  He was in Philly  for Easter  is what he said.  I had to go down  to Philly for Easter.  Well, you could have  supported us.  You didn't even  support yourself.  Yeah, but your kid's  not even going to  remember this.  Man, help me out.  He didn't even  support himself.  I'm out of this one.  I'm supposed to go?  We're not going to  get Anthony out  of that fucking house. 
[00:38:00]  We knew he wasn't  showing up.  Unless we had the  premiere at like a  Hooters.  DVD, I'll watch it  in my own theater.  Anthony, the premiere  is on the corner  at the end of your block.  All right, I'll be there.  All right.  What time?  Mustangs 20 minutes late.  Can I get a copy  of the movie?  We have a link.  We have a link.  You can watch it on.  The secret link?  Yeah, we sent it  to Kenny this morning.  I'll tweet that shit.  No, don't do that.  Oh, my God. 
[00:38:30]  I don't trust him.  I don't trust him.  A man who pisses  off Ed Asner.  What are you doing?  You an idiot?  What?  Don't give these guys  the movie on any level.  I didn't give him  anything yet.  Why do I say  these guys, though?  You guys.  I would just watch  it at home and be like,  You can give Anthony  the link on Monday,  but you can't give it  to him on Friday.  I might get drunk.  Yeah, you get shit-faced.  No, I wouldn't do that.  Lie from the compound!  Hey, let's just watch  the movie right here.  Fuck it.  Commentating on it. 
[00:39:00]  Someone's gonna put it up  on the internet anyway.  Yeah, you know  how the internet is.  They're being mysterious.  Very mysterious.  I think it's working.  This left turn  must be a hell of a left.  Well, no, we're going  the exact opposite of like,  remember the Speed 2 trailer?  Where they're sick, you know,  we gotta keep this boat  at 60 knots  or we all die.  And then they show them  running around the island.  And they showed you  right through halfway  into the third act.  So obviously,  they didn't die.  They're on the island.  So the joke I've been using,  the way we're describing it,  somewhere between,  our promotional,  somewhere between Speed 2  and like the crying game.  We'll give you a little bit of it, 
[00:39:30]  but then when I can't  give away the twist.  With 15 minutes,  it's very hard to give  a little synopsis of the movie  without ruining the movie.  Yeah, like people giving us shit.  The trailer's too short.  It's like,  it's a 15 minute fucking movie.  And we can't show you  shit in the trailer  because then you'll fucking,  we don't want you to ruin  the fucking movie.  Yeah, yeah.  And all these guys  will give us shit about this.  Once they see the movie,  they'll get why you can't do it.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Fair enough.  We were going to the party.  The party's a fucking great.  Me and him went,  the opening last week,  fucking, 
[00:40:00]  there's 3,000 people there,  outdoors.  Yeah, Leary was there.  Scorsese was there.  And what's her name?  Elton John.  Elton John was there.  How do you get a movie,  so you make the movie  and then you,  how does it become  part of the film festival?  You submit it.  You submit it and then,  with nine zillion other people.  So who got the call that,  yeah, we accepted your film?  This is the story.  I think that's kind of cool.  We were trying to submit it  to festivals,  but we're three lughead  fucking comedians.  We had no idea how to do it. 
[00:40:30]  We're missing deadlines  left and right.  But you didn't even know,  I'm joining everything  on the internet,  like all these fucking communities.  I get shit email every day  without a box festival.  But did you guys even know  how to make a movie?  Well, we kind of learned.  We've all fooled around  with a video camera,  but did you know about lighting  and all that shit?  I went to school for that shit.  Did you really, Joe?  I went to school for,  I went for video production  and I wanted to be a director.  So did all of us.  Yeah, I don't know.  That was the easy way  through college.  I knew how to non-linear edit  from school  and I knew how to work a camera. 
[00:41:00]  You know, lighting and stuff  wasn't great,  but that's a DP's job usually.  Joe put together  a good crew though.  So you hired some good people  that do that shit.  Yeah.  Joe did a fucking crazy job  directing this.  Really.  Thank you.  When I watched it,  I was like,  oh shit.  Yeah, this actually looks  like a movie.  Oh, it looks real.  Yeah, I thought it was going  to look like a YouTube video,  but when I watched it,  I was like,  oh shit,  there's a lot of responsibility  that's going to come from this.  The first time I watched it,  I literally had my thumb  on the stop button.  I was like,  the first time I get  douche chills  on shutting this off  and I was just like, 
[00:41:30]  fuck,  this actually looks  halfway decent.  Everybody watches the movie  like this,  ready?  At the end of it,  they're like,  that was really good.  Like, wow.  Surprise.  Like, wow,  you guys didn't suck.  Hey, what happened there?  Yeah.  It was good.  This guy,  Andres Carew,  who's our DP,  really made it look beautiful  and also hired  a great sound man  because that sound  is so important,  man.  You know,  it's got to,  you got to have a guy  that knows how to mic  everything properly  and have the backup,  you know,  all that shit.  Oh, you got to pick up  the words, Joe.  Oh, Bill,  you got to get the words  of the meat.  It's got to sound the same, 
[00:42:00]  you know.  You don't want the sound  sounding different  every level's all fucked up.  One of Joe's chicks  just playing some fucking  ragtime piano  underneath it.  Ragtime.  Sounds like a speakeasy.  I just think it's a great story  because I've known you guys  for a while.  I didn't know you  as a filmmaker  and now all of a sudden  you're in this fucking  film festival  and there's a buzz  on this thing.  Here's what happened. 
[00:42:30]  It was our first time  out of the gate  doing any of this stuff  so obviously we're  extremely honored  and flattered  to be part of this festival  so, but, you know,  because it was our  fucking Oscar, right?  We're extremely honored  I'd like to thank God.  I was waiting for  some sort of evil  to enter into this.  Let's not forget Haiti.  Imagine they're up  for a short film  like an Oscar.  Oh my God.  We'll never have you guys back.  No, it'll be over.  Fuck that.  I just got nominated  for an Emmy  for consideration. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, but you've got  to pay for that, right?  I don't.  FX's.  Yeah, you know  when they sent me  an email  for consideration  for the Louis show,  the episode  of the semi  I called the lady  I go, are you  fucking with me?  But it wasn't  she didn't get that  I thought it was  somebody really  fucking with me.  But she was like  no, sir.  Which episode?  The mother episode.  Yeah, that was a good episode.  That was a good one.  Do you know  you have  there's a submission fee?  One time  I had a  some stand-up thing 
[00:43:30]  and they go  do you want it to be  maybe I don't know  if this was Emmys  do you want it to be  considered for a  such and such award?  It's like  who doesn't want to  win a fucking award?  I'm like absolutely  they go  okay, it's a $600  submission fee  just so they'll watch it.  I'm like  isn't that that job  that's supposed to be  watching?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Fuck you.  So I paid it.  How much do I do?  Of course I did.  How much do I pay to win  motherfucker?  I talked to Louie though  I was like  hey, thanks for that  he was like  yeah, yeah  I mean  it's not going to happen  but you'll see your name  oh shit  your name will be  my name will be 
[00:44:00]  with all the other names  that you know  are going to be  it's not going to happen  yeah  relax  no  they're not going to have  fucking bald fat me  I know you guys  don't know me  but thank you mom  it's not going to happen  it's all bought and sold  Bob  yeah  yeah  filthy  follow the money  follow the money  Bobby was fucking  hilarious last night  we were at  we were at  one of those parties  for the festival  and we just  it was just all the people  trying to meet  someone important  so there was nobody there 
[00:44:30]  like who seemed like  we could do anything  that was important  oh there probably was  we just had no idea  how to meet  we were classic comedians  we just ended up  sitting by ourselves  in the corners  like you know  goofing on everybody  actually just  trashing each other  right  so at one point  there was these  two gay guys  like in like  their 50s or something  wearing like tight  like flannel shirts  and that song  Raspberry Beret  came on  and one of the guys  was just going  fucking starting  to go all out  dancing  I just look over at Bob  I go dude  I'll give me 100 bucks  if you go over  and start dancing  with that guy  and Bob's eyebrows 
[00:45:00]  go through the ceiling  100 bucks  and then he starts  walking over  and I immediately know  I'm going to lose  100 bucks  so my only desperation  to try to get it back  is like it's got to be  the whole song  Bob goes over there  with such positive energy  the guy immediately  starts dancing  like he made  the guy's night  like I still got it  and  oh man  and his boyfriend  got jealous  made like this  candy face  he was mad  he started shit  I gotta tell you  it was fucking  I laughed my fucking ass 
[00:45:30]  it was almost worth  it was like a good  $70 laugh  $70 laugh  so it still hurt  the extra 20 bucks  after 8 seconds  of dancing  I just reached  for my wallet  I was like  hey motherfucker  I walked over  he's gotten out  the 20's  I grabbed him  and walked out  the fucking door  but you gotta know  he would do shit  like that right  no I didn't  I thought he would  draw the line  at a festival  that we were in  not to do something  like that  and he enjoyed it  that's what killed me  I wanted a level  of awkwardness  he was a good dancer 
[00:46:00]  he was a good dancer  dude that guy  loved you  he was mimicking  every dumb move  I made  he was trying  to do the eyes  and the hands  and he would try  to do it  he had a drink  and one in  he was drunk  he was so old  Bob was a hottie  he was flattered  yeah  it was like  one of those equations  we were throwing  at you earlier  right yeah yeah  old guy with money  or chunky young fella  Bob was a chippy  I'm a fetish  yeah  what was it 
[00:46:30]  like when they show  it in the theater  is it on film  or they have  some kind of video  shit  what the fuck  is it on  it's on an iPhone  everybody gets an iPhone  is that it  and everybody just  watches it that way  in the same room  it's on film  it's a film festival  we didn't shoot on film  we shot on video  we shot in HD  and the projection  is HD cam  it's HD transfer  well that's exactly  what I was asking  more of a technical question  because me and Bob  couldn't answer  that technical question  oh is that it  hey what you 
[00:47:00]  fucking more  it's on a thing  yeah so of course  it's on film  meanwhile it's not on film  can the average person  in the festival  90% of the short  when we were in a thing  with 7 other shorts  90% of them  were shot on HD  can you tell it's not film  not really  these days it's really cool  in fact the movie before us  they shot on film  and I thought it was video  and then the kid was saying  we shot on film  and everybody was going  ah dude  you're one of the guys  keeping it real  you know  keeping it real  man  now you gotta be really honest 
[00:47:30]  so there was 7 of them  short films  where does yours fall  well this is funny  when it started out  we were last  we went 8th  out of 8  and when it started out  the first like 3 or 4  were so insanely shot  like  they looked like  IFC films  like  camera going in  and out of focus  all these metaphoric shots  it's all fucking heavy  they had actors in them  that I recognized  I was like  oh Jesus Christ  I've seen that  mother fucker 
[00:48:00]  did you ever see  Copland  remember the paramedic guy  when they make it look like  Michael Rapaport  kills himself  and he throws the gun  get the fuck out of here  that guy  he's in the first movie  I was like  oh Jesus Christ  the dad from  License to Drive  was in the third movie  I'm like  fuck it  hey they got  they're real actors  Joe  didn't one of them  have special effects  yeah one of them  the fifth movie  had CGI  had real special effects  in it  that literally  looked like  Michael Bay  this is why 
[00:48:30]  I didn't go  there's no fucking way  I was going to go down  there and be like  oh Jesus  we are hacks  and they were all  they were all like  super dramatic  like slices of life  like fucking emo  and I'm just sitting there  like oh we're fucked man  nobody's going to  want to see our horse shit  nobody is going to  want to see it  one cool shot was done  with roller skates  yeah we need a dolly shot  get a skateboard  get that Puerto Rican  in the park  get him over here  and then like 
[00:49:00]  it just started  to lighten up man  they hit like  the sixth movie  and it was like  this thing about  a guy's grandfather  and it was funny  and charming  and people started laughing  and I was like  alright  and then the next movie  was a flat out comedy  and that got a lot of laughs  so now I'm nervous  like fuck  I hope we get  as much laughs  as these guys got  you know  and then it came on  it did great  and it killed  so I was  I really felt like  I'm not going to  sit here and go  we were the best  I don't think that  I just think  that it held its ground 
[00:49:30]  for what it was  and I felt like  it was unique  for what it was  you know what I mean  well it's hard to judge  because you  you know made it  so it's hard to say  oh it was the best one  out of the lot  you know  or the worst  or the worst  right  right  he's saying that  because he doesn't want  if people are listening  that are in the festival  he doesn't want to be  hey our movie's the best  but I'll say it  ours was the best  yeah  I'll say it  you weren't there  you weren't there  I know that's why  I can say it  you can say it  did you uh  did you edit it  or uh  I co-edited it  with the DP 
[00:50:00]  yeah  did you  were you like  uh  going to  you motherfucker  man come on  leave that in  dick  no he  no we  I had all final decision  about shit like that  but he  he was the only one  from the production  that came with me  to the premiere  and it was like  we were both laughing  with relief  when it started  getting laughs  in the theater  and after where  we were both  like we both  admitted to each other  like I didn't know  if this fucking thing  was funny or not  man  because you sit there  editing it  you're like  I don't know  this is funny  I've seen it  too many times  yeah so 
[00:50:30]  I remember  Brian Regan  told me that  about  I walked  did you ever see  his DVD  I Walked on the Moon  the one he shot  at the improv  that's literally  probably the funniest  hour of stand up  I maybe have ever  seen in my life  just gutturally  the whole time  and when I met him  I go  Brian that is  one of the funniest  hours  and he goes  I couldn't even  look at that thing  anymore  I didn't even know  if it was funny  by the time  we were done  cutting  I was like  you didn't know  it was funny  now I understand  yeah you have no idea  I have no idea  what this is  it's a big pile  of shit  yeah  so it was cool 
[00:51:00]  man  and the festival  reps that we've  been dealing with  that have been  our points  have been really  enthusiastic about  the movie  they like our  sensation  and like Ope  was asking  how did you  know that you were in  they'd give you  a little call  and you go  bullshit  what happened was  we were failing  miserably at  submitting the film  this is what would  happen  Bill would come  over to the  apartment and go  yeah we should  submit to  Sundance  like we've been  saying  I go yeah  you're right  we gotta get on  that  alright I'm gonna 
[00:51:30]  go in the bathroom  you check it  he'd go in the  bathroom and then  he'd hear me go  fuck  we missed the  fucking deadline  that happened  like we were  always like  every festival  the Yukon  Northwest Territories  has a film festival  well let's submit to  that dude  we'll start at the  North Pole  we'll work our way  down  try to spin it  positive  shit  but now  fucking deadlines  at three  festivals  waiving the  submission fee  they want us in it  so now it's a lot  easier  you know  they just 
[00:52:00]  yeah  well I guess  once you do  Tribeca  so who calls  is this  I'll call you  Tribeca is one  of the biggest  ones  so obviously  got it in  in time  we're still  honestly dumbfounded  that we were  we were all  sitting there  last night  can you fucking  believe we're  into this thing  Bobby and I  go dance with  the gay guy  that's a good  career move  here we go  Bobby and I  have been working  for management  we've been working  with Leary's company  Apostle  and they called us  once  this guy Jim  Serpico  over there  yeah you know 
[00:52:30]  Jim right  Jim called us  and goes  do you guys  want help  submitting the  film  we're like  fuck yes  please  we don't know  what we're doing  so they started  sending it everywhere  and he called us  one day  and he goes  do you guys  want to submit  to Tribeca  and we're like  yeah yeah  absolutely  he goes  today's the last  day we got to  get it in  so we'll do it  and he sent it in  and then we just  kind of forgot  about it  we weren't  because we didn't  even think like  and then he kept  calling us  every few weeks  they really like it  man  they really like it  yeah the thing is  who once they  select all the ones 
[00:53:00]  they can look at  each one of them  watches 600  short films  Jesus Christ  and picks their  top 20  and then  then they look  at the other  two's top 20  and then they  decide from that  yeah it's like  March Madness  to like  the 9 million  yeah  no shit  yeah so we were  pretty like  alright well  what are the odds  of this  yeah right  yeah  we're just trying  you know  just kind of  put it out of  our head  not getting too  excited  and then one day  it was  I was in my  apartment  it was fucking  snowing  miserable  like middle  of February  ah he's painting  a picture  phone rings 
[00:53:30]  I'm just in the  apartment depressed  the phone rings  right  jerk it off  to gilf porn  gilf  you have some  lady baking  bread in your  kitchen  churning butter  or churning  cans  knitting you a scarf  gladness quit  hacking  I got a call  I made you  an af can  Joseph  yeah and the  phone rings  literally  brrrring  it's old 
[00:54:00]  meh  meh  and uh  yeah I don't  know where  I didn't recognize  the number  I pick up  and uh  this lady  says you know  my name is  this lady  says you know  my name's Sharon  I work for the  Tribeca Film Festival  I go oh  hey Sharon  how you doing  and she goes  uh well  like that  and there was  like this  one second  pause  and literally  in that second  I'm like  playing out  the million  different letdowns  she's about to  give me  you know  thank you for  submitting  but yeah  and she just  goes uh 
[00:54:30]  I'm calling to  make your snowy  day a little  better  uh we'd love  to invite you  to the  Tribeca  and I was  like holy  shit  I don't  accept  yeah  yeah  what's in it  for me  yeah  listen broad  yeah  and then she  goes  and then she  goes we'd  like you to  if you don't  have to do  this but we  would we  would really  like you to  world premiere  your film  here  with us  and it's like  what do you  say  you go of  course  yeah  absolutely  I didn't  realize how  big it was  though  we went to  the first night  I thought it  was just a  little festival 
[00:55:00]  you've never  heard of the  Tribeca film  festival before  I didn't say  that  I didn't know  how big  I didn't think  it was as  fucking huge  as it is  I mean  all the  I mean  it's crazy  and I didn't  know how they  started it  they started it  for September  11th to get  people back down  into Tribeca  is that how  it started  I never  heard that  they wanted  people to  back into  everybody  you don't  remember that  whole thing  everybody knows  why they  started the  city 
[00:55:30]  it was like  and the whole  thing was  yes  I didn't know  I didn't know  that  when it first  was pumped  out it was  like  it was huge  because it was  like wow  we're bringing  people back  something happened  10 years ago  what was that date  Bobby had some  info that none  of us knew  it was called  September 11th  I wasn't keeping  up on the  fucking arts  and leisure  section  Bobby thought  they started it  after the first  world trade  center attack  commemorating 
[00:56:00]  sooty mouths  I gotta agree  with you though  dude  I didn't quite  grasp the weight  of it  even though  it's called  an academy  award  they actually  have a nickname  for it called  an Oscar  the first time  this was used  evidently  was in the  1930s  it got its  name  because back  in 1946  bogey shoved  one of these  up Greta Gargoyle's  asshole  and she shit  and that was  called  having an Oscar  oh Bobby 
[00:56:30]  we didn't know  I didn't think  it was as  big as it is  like these  parties you go to  like the first  one we went to  it was fucking  incredible  and I feel  I mean I'm  white trash  dude  I shouldn't  be there  we're behind  this section  free food  free drinks  and I'm  you know  I'm trying to  tip the  I can't try  to tip the  guy  I'm the guy  that tips  the toll guy  because I feel  bad  you're trying  to grease  the waiter  thinking he's  going to get 
[00:57:00]  you to see  a producer  or something  I just felt  like a piece  of shit  like I  shouldn't be  here  just trying  and then a  couple sat  down  they've been  going to the  festival ever  since it started  they're like  total artsy  tribeca new  yorkers  and they sit  down with me  and Joe  and I'm just  trying to keep  my mouth shut  so I don't  fucking ruin it  don't fuck  anything up  yeah  so congrats  on the movie  there  I think we  got some  of the info  out  yes thank you  very much  you're listening  to the worst  of the Opie  and Anthony  show  Sirius XM  why don't we  do Bobo  that's a safe  target

[01:14:30]  uh bobo  how do you  think it went  there  i'm not  really sure  how  we are  what do  you think  yeah  like like  what was  the vibe  you felt  from the  audience  when you  left the  stage  did people  say anything  to you  give us  a little  insight  oh i know  a few people  said they  liked  they liked  it  yeah  who's that  fucking  competing  club  owners  i saw the  people  the audience  of course 
[01:15:00]  this keeps  going  no concept  the audience  so the  audience  said they  liked it  were you  were you  discouraged  by the  lack of  laughs  yeah  because i  noticed you  you you  stopped  talking  you left  like an  opening  for people  to laugh  and it  just came  off as  awkward  silence  because there  wasn't any  laughs there  bobo  yeah i  did i  think i  heard  i heard  some 
[01:15:30]  laughs  well  yeah  it wasn't  really you  know  were you  expecting  more  yeah  i was  expecting  more i  wasn't sure  what to  expect  the small  crowd  yeah  what about  uh  now that  material you  were doing  about the  neighbors you  think that's  strong stuff  i think it  is maybe i  need to maybe  i need to  rework it a  little bit  rework it  punch it up  a little you  know learn  from your  experience  figure out  what worked  and what  didn't 
[01:16:00]  yeah  why don't  you try it  out uh  down at the  cellar  your cellar  not the  comedy club  i was just  thinking  just go  and hang  yourself  exactly the  fucking btk  had a fucking  that family had  a better time in  the cellar than  the audience  the comedy  cellar  oh shit  jerking off to  their fucking  humming child  they have a  horrid time  in their cellar  a bad time  when dennis  raider showed  up  not fun  so esty the  way you get  on at the 
[01:16:30]  cellar is you  need two comedy  cellar comedians  to recommend you  yeah  then esty will  look at your  tape she won't  even look at  your tape before  right  just because  you know  she gets a  lot of tapes  yeah of course  and then she  puts you on an  audition on a  late show friday  and it's not an  easy crowd  late show friday  you go on like  third  yeah  and a lot of  comics don't do  well  um and i  couldn't do it  to her  but i would  so  oh i would  love to get him  on there on a  friday but i  couldn't i'd never  make it through the  tape phase  get the recommend  and then

[01:17:30]  there you go  really great  i like hearing  that what about  the fact that you  only did half of  the time you were  supposed to do  well what happened  was i wasn't  trying to i was  trying to try to  get try to get  it like short  enough that it  doesn't run too  long  yeah but when  they give you  seven minutes  you do seven  minutes  they'll let you  know when you're  running long  i know that but  i i didn't i  can't i i  miscalculated it  is what happened  they give you a  light in the back  bobo you can  usually ask what  the light is and  then just look 
[01:18:00]  for it and when  you walk on stage  don't just start  barreling through  material take a  second say hello  to the audience  all right i i  next time i'll do  that you don't  have to say how  you're doing  because everybody  asks that you  can but you  got to have like  some connection  to the audience  that but you  don't you look  great in jim  norton's shirt  though i got it  yeah you really  did but thanks  that's a gift  from jim to you  huh yeah  that was nice  i actually like  that shirt i  dig it it's a  nice shirt  everybody everybody  i know likes it  you know what  you should talk

[01:19:30]  you're lying  this is i've been  listening first of  all on friday  when i asked him  how did your  comedy set go he  said it went  fantastic it went  great you asked  him he said oh  i don't know i  think it went  all right on  right on friday  he said i figured  it was only a  matter of time  before a-listers  started knowing who  bobo was  i'm not surprised  that ice tea  knows who i am  and i think that  a-listers will  know who i am  because of my  comedy not my  radio career  is that true  well we have  tape bobo  what i said is 
[01:20:00]  event what i  meant eventually  they'll know who  i am oh boy  please don't do  what you're thinking  of doing eventually  everyone will know  mark chapman  everyone will know  me that's what  mark david  chapman said  on the flight over  from hawaii  fuck  they're all gonna  know my name  i'll pump two  shots  yes  and he's not  even laughing  that's what's  even creepier  all right bobo  we're gonna cut  this short i think  today  yeah  you're lying 
[01:20:30]  though bobo  it's already too  late  i'm sure if sam  has nothing to do  with the 10 o'clock  hour he'll call you  back  it's been a lot  of bobo on the  10 o'clock hour  lately  what were the racial  jokes by the way  the fake obama  the obama impersonator  did they cut him  short  oh and a what  that guy almost  looked like obama  he did  yeah  almost  we can talk  about that tomorrow  bobo thank you  all right  no problem  by the way op  i got an extra  ticket to the  bet game  on july 16th  do you want to  go  yeah he'll go 
[01:21:00]  yeah  he said you  wanted to go  oh  by the way  by the way  you're listening  to the worst  of opie anthony  it's the worst  of the opie anthony  show  serious  xm  i understand  why a guy  robs a bank  i really  even though  it's a terrible  crime and  but if you  rob a bank  and don't  kill anybody  you're gonna  do 25 years  anyway  yeah  so you might  as well  kill somebody  so you might  as well  shoot your  way out  absolutely  yeah  you might  as well  shoot your  way out  well  that's why  they have 
[01:21:30]  yeah that's  why a lot  of times  they do  go shooting  because they  know they're  going for  the rest  of their lives  and why  would you  ever look  at the  robber  fuck  that  would you  take a  peek  when you're  straight down  at the  floor  that's  actually  why would you  ever look  that's  always the  wrong move  in every  fucking  bank robber  movie  i would  have to  take a  peek  though  you would  take a  peek  see if  his back  is turned  and then  just blast  the back  of his  head out  well you  got a  gun  no you  already  they already  checked  you for  shit  and you're  on the 
[01:22:00]  floor  check me  guy ain't  checking me  for nothing  i see  they usually  come in  and go  on the  floor  no  most bank  robberies  are just  some guy  that goes  up to  the  window  no one  knows  the bank  is being  robbed  until he's  out  it's not  like the  movies  why would  you be  the dummy  that pushes  the button  it's not  my money  i'm not  moving  you see how  they robbed  that bank  in the town  they just  burst through  the door  and just  start smashing  faces  that's how  you gotta  do it  but why  would you  be the  teller  that has  to nervously  try to  go for 
[01:22:30]  the button  fuck  that  you're not  paying me  enough  no fuck  that  i'm not  going for  the button  i was in  an armed  robbery  and i did  look down  and i told  my girlfriend  at the time  look down  really  oh yeah  years ago  what happened  i was in  mcdonald's  many years ago  in my  in north  brunswick  and i was  the girl  of the day  named her  miss tina  at the time  i'm getting  chills  and uh  seriously  that just  gave me  fucking chills  we're sitting  facing  this was mcdonald's  in north  brunswick  and it faces  out  like i mean  we were sitting  at the counter  looking out  at the parking  lot  and tina and  i said  it might be  nine at 
[01:23:00]  night  it was late  and i see  the left  the uh  there was  two entrances  one to the  left and then  the front  entrance  which is  to my  right  and i see  three guys  coming in  or two guys  coming in  wearing parkas  yeah  ski parkas  and it was  august  and i immediately  oh shit  it was a problem  so the one guy  comes in  i forget what he  said but he's  got a pistol  and the one guy  comes over  he grabs me  and my girlfriend  did he say  oogly boogly  yes 
[01:23:30]  you got grabbed  by these guys  yeah but not  how many people  were in the  mcdonald's  not that many  maybe 12  it was late  but they grabbed  you out of  everybody  no no no  they were just  trying to get  everybody to the  front of the  store  okay  they were just  so they grabbed  me and tina  he just corralled  us right  but she fell  getting up  and he said  come on  come on  come on  and i was like  they're gonna  rape her in the  back  i was really  scared about that  oh man  so we walk up  to the front  and i was holding  a couple hundred  dollars of her money  this was like  i mean this is  probably 1988  that's before  i did stand up  wow 
[01:24:00]  and uh  i remember the  one black woman  ran out the  front door  who worked there  and there was  somebody corralling  people from the  front  so we were all  up at the front  and i had my  hands up  and i was like  i just told tina  to look down  don't look at him  do not look at  the guy  look at the  floor  look at the  floor  and we could  hear the guy  in the back  screaming  open the  safe  open the  safe  screaming  and his  pistol i  actually saw  i was nervous  and the guy  but the guy  we were talking  who was out  with us  we're not gonna  hurt you  no one's  gonna get hurt  uh  but then you  get scared  they're just  gonna take 
[01:24:30]  your girlfriend  they're gonna  throw as a  it's like  it was  fucking  horrifying  uh  holy shit  i never told  that story  yeah  and we're  just standing  looking down  at the floor  yeah  i remember  looking down  at the floor  it's been a  bunch of years  but yeah  and uh  but that was  my first instinct  was do not  look at them  because you  don't want to  you just want  to be a piece  of the furniture  right  if you just  stand there  looking down  you don't  want to make  that eye  contact  the guy  goes  oh fuck  now he could  possibly you know  pick me out of  a lineup or  something  do you feel  violated  no i almost  gave them the 
[01:25:00]  money in my  pocket but they  didn't they  didn't rob us  they did not  rob the people  they only robbed  the store  but did you  feel like what  after it was  over what  happened  um i was  skimming the  cops came like  i didn't see  anything i was  just so scared  because a gun  had been way  it's like you  know again  now i would  just tell them  what i mean i  did tell them  what happened  but in that  moment you're  in shock  you know you  had a gun  point today  it's scary  it's fucking  scary  um but  violated  hard to say  because they  didn't rob me  like the guy  didn't even  the guy who  she just happened  to fall when he 
[01:25:30]  was corralling  us up  they didn't rob  you but they  made they  they made you  do something  that you did  not want to do  they scared us  a lot  but it was  it was a pure  store robbery  in the sense  that even the  guy who was  out with us  you know he  was robbing  the store  but he wasn't  abusive to us  he wasn't  shitty to us  you know i  mean i knew  it like  there was  nothing personal  with us  we were just  window dressing  just stay here  and shut the  fuck up  and everything's  fine  this has nothing  to do with you  and it didn't  that would be  great if your  chick was like  why don't you 
[01:26:00]  people get a  job  great  i would have  raped her  great right  but that is  what i was  scared of  was that they  were going to  grab her on  the way out  the door  so you never  know  yeah let's  take this  and then the  relief when they  were gone  tremendous  relief  they ran right  out but  hearing that guy  yell in the  back  he's going to  kill that  guy  that's got  to be very  scary when  you're being  forced to  open a safe  open the  safe  motherfucker  yeah i don't  remember what  he was yelling  but he was  really fucking  yelling  i would forget  the combination  oh dude  that really is  one of those  things where  it's like 
[01:26:30]  don't fuck  it up  yeah it was  very very  scary but  again there  was three  guys  like hamilton  trying to  open the  safe  open the  fucking  safe  lame  motherfucker  you don't  know how  many had  guns  even if i had  a gun i  don't know if  i would have  pulled it  because  yeah when you  got more  people  blast them  all and  risk getting  other people  shot  that would  have been  a tough  call  yeah that is  that's one of  those calls  where it's like  just stand here  and just be  prepared but  don't do  anything  yeah that's a  situation where  you gotta you  gotta roll with 
[01:27:00]  them  because there was  a guy in the  back who would  have been shot  if you start  hearing gunfire  that's different  then you gotta  start you know  self-preservation  mode but yeah  you can't endanger  there's not a  situation if you  if you're legally  allowed to carry a  gun concealed it  doesn't mean  every time  something happens  you pull it  out and start  fucking shooting  because uh  you could definitely  fuck the situation  well you can get  yourself killed  because there was  a guy behind us  and the guy  it was like  it was just  they weren't all  in your sight line  you know  that's it was  they were literally 
[01:27:30]  those guys were  just watching the  doors  just they just  wanted they wanted  to get out of  there too  right wow  how long did it  take for the  cops to show up  after a couple  of minutes i mean  the north brunswick  police department was  literally a half mile  down the street  wow those guys are  probably from new  brunswick from the  projects or from  franklin which was  not that far but  were they african  american gentlemen  they're black guys  yeah they definitely  were yes yes  yeah but that's  what i didn't say  i thought i said  they would run  in there were  three black guys  they ever uh  catch them  i don't know  to be honest with  you i mean that's  so many years ago  i don't know 
[01:28:00]  wow  that's fucking  harrowing  yeah that was  fucking scary  all right here we  go uh brendan  in south carolina  brendan  good morning boys  hey good morning  uh good uh  similar story to  jimmy i was  actually uh  my first seal job  and walked into  uh a bank i hadn't  made a deposit  because i was  barking on the  weekends to get  some extra cash  i probably had  1500 bucks  two grand  and was making a  deposit into the  bank and you know  kind of chatting up  the teller  and had an you know  kind of elbow 
[01:28:30]  leaning up on the  counter looked left  and saw this guy  walking into the  bank and i was  like wow he's  dressed spotty  warm for july  and uh he  dropped the door  open with a  little uh  uh little  footstep thing  and uh walked  right in with a  ski mask handed  a note right over  the counter with  gloves on i realized  what's happening and  kind of put my  hands right on the  counter where i  could see he was  a little bit shorter  than i he showed  the butt of his  gun in his waistband  and you know 30  seconds later he was  walking out of the  bank with a bag full  of cash  yeah it's probably 
[01:29:00]  that's the best way  to do it  yeah yeah  just fucking  you know don't get  involved with it  especially if  they're fucking  getting yourself  killed  most times i'm  assuming i'm  sure there's  those sociopaths  who want to  hurt somebody  yeah i really  think most people  just doing a  store robbery  like that uh  with a lot of  people in it or  bank just want to  get the fuck out  it's also the  late night ones  where a store is  closing up yeah  and the employees  are there that's  a dangerous situation  because a lot of  times they're just  like well we got  to do is kill  these motherfuckers  and uh and no 
[01:29:30]  witnesses more  importantly did you  get to eat your  happy meal i don't  remember i said  don't take my  mcnuggets you  black son of a  bitch i really  white guided up  on him or you  just throw a  mcnugget at the  back of his head  here eat this  chicken lover  things you can do  that will get you  shot  oh wow let's say  hi to scrambler in  chicago scrambler  scrambler  yesterday my uh 
[01:30:00]  uncle was uh  two gentlemen  rang his doorbell  uh dressed in  snowmobile gear you  know the coach the  bibs and ski mask  and i asked if he  had any gas or  snowmobile ran out  oh yeah you you  tweeted this last  night right  yeah yeah so i  read that one  and uh i talked to  him he called me  before surgery i  talked to him real  quick and i talked  to him right after  he got out of  surgery yesterday  and uh so he  said you know here  the sheds over there  help yourself with  some gas and then  uh one was black  one was white he  could tell through 
[01:30:30]  the mats  and uh so then  they rang the door  about a little bit  later and they got  into i don't know  what happened to lead  to the tussle but  he said he you know  kind of got into  it with one of  them because he  knew that something  was going to happen  and then uh he got  like you know one  of them hit him  over the head with  the gun and uh they  shot him and uh one  shot at each of his  inner thighs and uh  they missed everything  no arteries or  anything one went in  and out and the other  one was lodged in um 
[01:31:00]  and so we had to go  to surgery you know  obviously when they  left he uh called  911 he crawled  upstairs grabbed his  380 uh crawled back  downstairs and uh  waited for the uh  you know the police  to get there and he  was uh four hours  later he came out of  surgery and uh talking  to me on the phone he  was uh he wasn't uh  seemed like he was  alright for a guy just  got shot twice you  know jesus christ  that does make anthony  look less nuts for  having his gun on him  though because your  uncle had a gun i  mean it's like you do  have to have it on you  i guess because people  don't wait for you to 
[01:31:30]  run upstairs i know i  don't i don't answer  the door uh without one  like if i see somebody  knocking on my door  and stuff i'm like who  the fuck is this all  right but then i just  i smile and open the  door hi how are you  what do you need what  do you want i do that  too i make you know  if somebody's coming  like a service guy or  something i always make  sure i got it on the  hip and you know i  open it you know and  that's the first thing  they see you don't talk  about it but you make  sure that the first  thing they see is the 
[01:32:00]  you know the the grips  hanging out of your  waistband or sticking  out of your holster and  you know yeah just let  them let them let them  know um no shenanigans  see what you got to do  is you got to be subtle  about when they you go  hi sorry for the delay i  was just buffing my  bullets buffing your  bullets yes whatever it  is done people do i don't  know do you have buff  bullets i was washing my  gun i was washing the  bullets you don't wash  your gun no no no how  about you say sorry i had  my bullets on tumble dry i 
[01:32:30]  was removing them and  putting them in my gun  well we're glad he's  doing well there so  that's uh well that's a  hell of a story you got  scrambled yeah exactly  people are just brazen  brazen home invasions  wisconsin the only other  state besides illinois that  doesn't have a legal carry  law they do have a loophole  where you can open carry but  you can't have it on you in  your car or in a restaurant  so it's kind of worthless but 
[01:33:00]  it is the only other state  besides illinois no  concealed carry law wow  all right that's something  there you go damn all  right sir have a good  morning boys you just  remember let's go to nate  in delaware nate hey  morning boys when i was in  college my uh i got a phone  call and i got a call from  my dad saying my mom was  robbed at gunpoint while  manning uh their car lot uh  family-owned business uh she  was 49 months pregnant and uh 
[01:33:30]  the black gentleman he came  in showed her the gun uh  asked her to get on her  knees tied her up and my mom  just said please don't kill  me i'm pregnant and he said  i'm not gonna hurt you ma'am he  stole a car hundred dollars in  cash dumped the car about five  miles down the road and they  never found him  she might your mom got very  lucky wow when you said he  pulled her on her knees i was  like the story's about to get  great oh great oh my god  oh she laughs about it now you  know she tells the story and she 
[01:34:00]  had no fear it was just it was  amazing god i probably look at  life differently right i bet she  thought she was getting oh yeah  fucking back of the head let's  say hi to robert in wisconsin  robert hey there bab a couple  more of these we'll move on what's  up robert hey what's up guys  hey when i was 19 i was a manager  at wendy's and uh this two guys  came in with shotguns with  ski masks on i thought it was  just my friends fucking with me  so i kept pushing the shotgun  away until he smashed me in the  face oh god yeah and then i was 
[01:34:30]  like oh fuck this is real and  then they took me back and i'm  trying to open the safe while  fucking blood coming down my face  and shit i'm like oh man i was  all fucked up why would you assume  it's your friend exactly oh you  silly gooses i just what i  didn't think it was real i was  just too young and stupid i was  just like i don't know it didn't  seem real to me it would be a  great prank to pull on your  friends if you knew no one else  was around but yeah exactly but  fuck the cop comes in and blows  your head off exactly standing  there with a gun wow all right 
[01:35:00]  guys all right man let's say hi  to charlie in staten island he's  retired nypd what's up charlie  charlie yeah i'll be on the silent  alarm they got a delay on the  button um it's like three or five  minutes so that gives the time for  the robber to get out so there's no  hostages taken oh look at that  yeah there's a delay that's a long  five minutes for everybody now what  if they're abusing people and hurting  them i don't know but they i guess 
[01:35:30]  they don't want hostage situation kind  of like dog dog the afternoon right  okay that makes sense logically i guess  it makes sense unless you're in that  situation because you you would hope  someone comes immediately if you touch  you know push that button yeah you  need help immediately but why charlie i  gotta call you out on this okay all  right so there's a delay because they  don't want a hostage situation but why  wouldn't there be no delay but the  nypd allows five minutes  uh-huh you know what i mean so you  know exactly when the button was  pushed 
[01:36:00]  no it goes through the system somehow  when you when they push the button  it's all it goes automatically but the  delay is on nypd then the dispatch for  end of it oh well that seems like  could be a lawsuit yeah i think that  they probably uh they probably wait  out i think they wait five minutes  before they enter the bank because  they probably walk you could probably  walk outside and the cops are waiting  for you i don't see a five minute  like what they're murdering people  what if they're in there spray  painting graffiti or whatever they do  guy who just goes off point 
[01:36:30]  i don't know why they do it but i  know that it's what if they're in  there turning the chairs upside down  and throwing the pens all over then  what happens and ripping the  calendars up putting the deposit slips  where the withdrawal slips go yeah  what if they're doing that using all  the ink in the pens then what do we  do go ahead your turn  see you later  all right charlie he's had it with us  yeah just  oh a little beep beep beep but don't  don't be the person trying to push the  button no don't do that no heroes no 
[01:37:00]  heroes because you know the company  doesn't care in the end they're not  going to give you a big fucking bonus  if you survive no the bank robbery and  save them money i would be a hero and i  would stand up and i would tell them i'm  not standing for this and i would point  at the table i'm i'm a hero you think  that would cause problems for my teeth  yes one one fucking gun butt to the  gums that must have been something  just seeing young jimmy norton with  his head down her don't look at him  don't look at him were you able to  communicate anything to your chick 
[01:37:30]  while while this was going on yeah  we're staying actually i just said just  i just quiet as i just look down do  not look up at them don't look what'd  you say motherfucker i said you say i  said what do we expect from you people  this is what we expect this is why  gentrification it was on a long 45  minute discussion about gentrification  the debate i'm not going to debate you  jimmy this isn't a debate what's that 
[01:38:00]  from  that fargo  where's the where's the mcdonald's  clip  oh uh well do you want the you want  the beating or her talking about it  because there's a lot i don't really  know because i i i really have not  followed this story  yeah she uh it's out of boston i know  that right  no actually  wasn't that one out of boston malty  moore  oh  malmore  i don't even know where the fuck it  happened  yeah and um she was in the bathroom 
[01:38:30]  right sure  and uh as a what as a woman  woman with a dick  as a well i don't know if the thing  has a vagina  or not okay  and um she's in the bathroom and i think  one of the girls accused her of  looking at her mans  and then said that you look like a man  and just proceeded to beat start beating  the shit out of uh out of him her  whatever it is uh kicking in the head  dragging by the hair the wig comes off 
[01:39:00]  and then pulling by the hair  kicking in the head  until this um  transgender uh uh uh person  went into a seizure  at the front door  and that's when the guy that was uh  videoing the the melee  who worked at mcdonald's  said oh you better you better get out of  here the cops is coming to you better get  out of here  so they fired him  for uh videoing it  and not leaving  uh or not uh helping  why would you help  when two  well one fat woman tried to step in 
[01:39:30]  and help but  that was to no avail  right  it's just this fucking  like i i you know  i always say behave  but just fucking behave  and so many of these things  turned up  i watched the street melee  in uh san francisco  i guess it was  where some bitch got fucking  bashed in the head  with a high heel  and she's bleeding profusely  her tits are hanging out  they're in the street fighting  it's just some  ignat shit  going on  it's great stuff to check out 
[01:40:00]  chuck e cheese  on a nightly basis  i look at nothing  but fast food beat downs  it's great  it's uh  it's it's  it's like an epidemic you think  yeah yeah it is  why  it's something that's just happening  because some people don't know  how to just behave  and and have patience  uh when you're in a mcdonald's  you're not getting  the the the best service  i'm sorry mcdonald's  you're just not  so sometimes your food order  gets fucked  uh you're you're around  people that annoy you 
[01:40:30]  but you just get your shit  and you leave  eventually  but there are some people  that just can't uh  can't deal with waiting  waiting in line  um uh dealing with uh  a staff that might have  forgotten something  it instantly turns  into this violence  it goes  it goes from  yelling this  horrid shit  to just  throwing shit  and then to punching  that's pretty much  the chain of events  i see when i watch  uh the thousand of these 
[01:41:00]  that i have watched  have you been in a mcdonald's  recently  i've not been in a mcdonald's  in  i mean  probably since the  new days  oh yeah  it's gotta be 10 years  at least  i went in one  uh recently  just to film some shit  yeah  and i i'll be honest  with you aunt  i was amazed  yeah  by the clientele  well they do  because when i was  growing up  oh yeah  it was a different  mcdonald's  it was families  suburban families  would go there  i had a mcdonald's  in my neighborhood  and you know  it was a big deal  when mom and dad 
[01:41:30]  would go  hey kids  we're going to  mcdonald's  and we'd hop in the car  and uh dad would  call me a faggot  because i'd bring my  my little puppet  that he called a doll  and uh we'd drive  to mcdonald's  and uh  was it a barbie doll  uh no no no  i had made it  it was a it was a puppet  it was a marionette  that didn't have  strings yet  i was working on it  you you made it  from scratch  yeah  was it from a kit  no  i just took some  like fucking cloth  and that's weird  and shit  and well i wanted 
[01:42:00]  to make a marionette  a little strange  i wanted to make  a marionette  you ever see him  i know  and then you make  the x with the wood  right  and you attach  the little strings  to the hands  and the head  and the legs  and it moves around  but if you don't  have the strings  then i think my dad  was right  it is just what  amounts to a doll  so why didn't  you get the strings  well lazy  well i know  and what was  the name of your  marionette  i'm a kid  what was the name  of the marionette  i'm not i'm not  sure it had a name  yet  and that's kind  of a thing  did he throw it  out the window  um yeah i think  he did he did  kind of toss it 
[01:42:30]  and well he didn't  want me to grow up  to be a fag  opie i would have  been a fag if i  would have had that  marionette that he  said was a doll  right  yeah so we hop in  the car go to  mcdonald's  without your marionette  without my marionette  threw that on  yeah jericho turn  you're not taking  that you're not  taking that fucking  doll with it with  you uh oh joey let  him take it it's a  puppet it's not a  puppet it's a doll  shut the fuck up bro  we're all going to  mcdonald's wow he  said mcdonald's i was  happy for two seconds  that we hopped in the  rambler then we're 
[01:43:00]  like oh here it  comes again here it  comes again more  yelling and screaming  yeah what happened at  mcdonald's nice little  family well it was a  family thing yeah yeah  when you used to get  your fast food and go  to a beach that was a  long island thing to  do i guess i did that  but but as a family  thing before i got  older uh you'd just  sit at mcdonald's and  eat but then afterwards  when you get a little  older you would do  that what was your  favorite fast food  joint growing up  mcdonald's mine was  kentucky fried chicken  mcdonald's uh no it 
[01:43:30]  was uh kentucky fried  chicken was number one  and then uh and then  burger king kind of  sparked up burger king  was the tastier right  yeah yeah that charbroil  thing uh but then they  were tastier but then  growing up to the  point where like you  hit 18 you start  drinking it's all about  taco bell right there's  i'm not talking about  holy shit jack in the  box white castle what's  wrong with you jack in  the box dude you get  your breakfast jack and  they or you get your  jack tacos that look  like they were filled  with baby shit yeah what  it was that i was there 
[01:44:00]  was the furthest thing  from meat thank god you  ever you were too drunk  to give a fuck what that  stuff really was and  then whatever you didn't  finish you threw against  the window of the  fucking jack in the box  you know what that  was and drove away i  know what it was why  they had homeless guys  in the back that pre  chewed the food before  they put it in that  shit and spit it into  the they spit it into a  big vat and then you  had a jack in the box  worker scoop it up with  a ladle and make your  uh what was it called  uh the the taco right  just the uh i guess yeah 
[01:44:30]  with that mystery meat  and then there was uh  when roy rogers first  opened up uh the the  clientele not the  clientele the the people  that work there had a  dress in cowboy hats and  and roy rogers uniforms  and had to actually when  you came up to the  counter they had to say  howdy partner and then  when you left they gave  you a bag and they had  to say happy trails it  just reminded me of  fucking hamilton and  fast times sure it's all 
[01:45:00]  prepared the same way  were you did you have  a trout dog were you  an arby's guy um i  liked arby's because  there there was an  arby's by the drive-in  movie theater in comac  wow and we used to go  there and i liked arby's  until my sister had a  tummy ache and we all  ate arby's and then she  threw up in the car  during uh that'll ruin  it during i believe  chitty chitty bang bang  and uh and she threw up  in the car and it totally  put me off of uh arby's 
[01:45:30]  for the rest of my life  that was yeah and uh  yeah but the mcdonald's  was um like you said it  was predominantly  especially where we were  from very suburban very  white uh that was there  was never violence at  mcdonald's ever and now  they really are catering to  um a lot of uh uh  ethnicity a lot of um  africa i think they cater  too much to african  americans mcdonald's  which i if i was african 
[01:46:00]  american i'd be very  angry that uh they're  trying to uh pump you  full of uh horrid food  that gives you nothing  but obesity and uh  diabetes but um they're  catering to um they even  have this this special  secret site uh something  360 black and it's all  about diversity at mcdonald's  i think it's black365.com  is that it i believe so  yeah yeah yeah i read  that on a site  yes uh iraq there's a lot  of mcdonald's ads now where 
[01:46:30]  they're just sponsoring big  like soul and r&b festivals  yes and religious events  essence music festival  sponsored by mcdonald's in  kota kota what's on  mcdonald's menu for the  2011 essence music festival  festival like mcdonald's  has completely gone black  and um seems that you  know if if you want to  market that way that's  fine but then you got to  go with the repercussions  of um some people that i  guess have grown up  impoverished and um 
[01:47:00]  disillusioned and uh  strike out in certain  ways i love the families  they're showing on this  fucking web page what kind  of stuff is going on  there i don't think i've  seen any of that in my  life by the way the  um boston thing was two  chicks fighting over  pancake syrup at danny  that denny's oh yeah  yeah yeah okay over the  syrup over the syrup what  is 365 black at mcdonald's  we believe that african 
[01:47:30]  american culture and  achievement should be  celebrated 365 days a year  not just during black  history month that idea uh  that's the idea behind  365 black.com it's a place  where you can learn more  about education employment  career advancement and  entrepreneurship opportunities  and meet real people who  lives have been touched by  mcdonald's how is your life  touched by a mcdonald's a  heart attack stroke diabetes  obesity plus you can also

[01:50:30]  we have been a supplier of ice cream toppings and dipping sauces to mcdonald's since 1998  mcdonald's is your neighborhood restaurant  we make sure we understand  it's not a restaurant  no it's not  it's a fast food joint  the differences that make each person special and unique  a restaurant  i'll show you to your table sir  our restaurants  reflect the people we serve every day  so you see why we proudly say  that mcdonald's is deeply rooted in the community  365 days a year

[01:59:30]  we're singing like douchebags  the fucking puppies  doesn't cover this  I wanna hear that  sometimes I touch you with it nice  whoa  the honesty's too much  and I have to close my eyes  this song used to make me sad  because I was in love with a girl  in junior high  that didn't love me  and  and  and for no reason  just saying it's a treat for you  for no reason whatsoever  I tied this song  to  how I felt about the girl 
[02:00:00]  oh you  fucking let me sick  you know why it makes you sick?  because you're thinking of yourself too  of course I'm awful  faggot  please  babe  Vice 6 was my first song with a girl  but I  I used to walk by a girl's house  with Iron Man playing  I think I was cool  but no it's because  I know the line is  when we both  you'd hold each other  and both break down and cry  like you thought you and the girl  were gonna hold each other  why couldn't we though  Jimmy  and realize your love  but uh  no she didn't even know  who I was  and I don't know why  I equated this song  to our non-existent relationship 
[02:00:30]  but she was  like when I saw her  this was the song  you would have both cried  her would she realize  what a drunk you are  and you wouldn't realize  you couldn't fuck other girls anymore  you want to hear about Kim Jong-il  I found the list  oh yeah  it's terrific  sometimes when we touch  no it wasn't Dreamweaver  you asshole  oh  oh going to get Tom Papa  why do you have to go get Tom Papa  why don't we have a staff  we're still working 
[02:01:00]  what are you getting  you're on air right now  it's Christmas  it's Christmas  no one's here  no one's here  can you imagine other shows  doing this  see you right back guys  I thought we were going to  both break down and cry  I thought I was going to  hold her  until the fear  in me  what kind of fear  did I have  being called a homo  for holding a doll  maybe  you should have sang that  that's true  break down and cry with you  I know  when you fall in love  for the first time  you do dumb shit  oh  it was just 
[02:01:30]  I used to  I used to like  open arms by  Jerry  and go  listen to the words  this is our song  did you think  he described you  in the lyrics  of course  you know what  when you fell in love  back in  your teens  and stuff like that  in school  it was  it  it was  totally  all encompassing  every second  of the day  you couldn't do anything else  you couldn't do anything else  but think about it  it was a plague 
[02:02:00]  it was a blight  and it was something  that was fantastic  and horrible  horrifying  it was just terrible  because then you would  think about it  ending or something  yes  and it would  but when you were in it  it was like this  it was so much more  than it is now  now it's just what it is  you know  this is a good one  this is a good one  yeah  it's a good tune  do you come  with open arms  no I cheat  no everything's closed 
[02:02:30]  my phone is locked  open arms  locked phone  it's right  you couldn't do your homework  you couldn't fucking  hang out with your friends  anymore  you couldn't do shit  it was a constant  adrenaline rush  that you were constantly  getting butterflies  and whooshes  it was a nightmare  and then  there was too much pressure  and that was when  you were just alone  thinking about it  then when you saw the girl  forget it  it was crazy  crazy  you looked like such an idiot 
[02:03:00]  I was a madman  you mean when you were dating her  or when you just liked her  no he's talking about  he's talking about this  fucking  love  this junior high  high school love shit  I was in love  where you thought  this was it  you would never see  another girl in your life  I wouldn't even look at it  like I would look at other girls  and think  oh she's disgusting  compared to  you know  whatever  you're so right  you couldn't even see  any other good looking girls  no they weren't good looking  no one else was good looking  you couldn't even acknowledge that  no  and then they fuck you over 
[02:03:30]  and you try to break your arm  in your garage  with a baseball bat  to garner sympathy  oh I forgot  oh  that's not  oh Jimmy  oh  yeah  huh papa  yeah I literally did that Jimmy  I know  it disgusts you  oh that's terrible  but I couldn't  I couldn't really commit to it  so I  I just wound up  bruising my arm  I'm talking about being in love  in like junior high  and the girl broke up with me  and actually went out  with one of my friends  so I went into the garage  with a baseball bat  tried to break my arm 
[02:04:00]  to get sympathy  from her  like oh look  I have a broken arm  how could you break up with me  when I now have a broken arm  so I took the bat  and would swing it  and yeah  I kind of hold up  I bunt  I kept bunting  instead of swinging away  I thought you were  body's own self-defense  of course it is  like you wanna keep going  my brain has called me an idiot  but my heart said  swing away  swing away  I couldn't really commit  no I couldn't commit to the pain  I punched a brick wall  in Geneseo over and over again  to get the attention of a girl  yeah  that didn't give a fuck about me 
[02:04:30]  you punched it in front of her  no just  if I had like  kind of a broken hand  that somehow  that would make her  pay more attention to me  yeah  it's fucking pathetic  I would pretend that I was in a fight  I rode off on my bike  and like  ripped my t-shirt  pulled the neck  ripped the t-shirt  how you pictured someone  that had been in a fight  would look  messed my hair up  and came back  I was just in a fight  I was attacked in the woods  by some guys  just looking at me  did she believe you?  no  I didn't look like I was in a fight  I looked like I woke up 
[02:05:00]  I think my broken hand idea  that would make me look tough  if I had a cast  and that would somehow  make her go  fuck he's a real man  and I'm the idiot  I'm the asshole  see we all have the same  dumb idea  that somehow  some physical thing  was going to make her  emotionally like you again  yeah  and it never worked  by the way  E-Rock has decided to go  with a love soundtrack  in back  oh  of us  he's just picking songs now  yeah  no Tom  but Anthony made a great point  and something I forgot about  yes I did 
[02:05:30]  a long fucking time ago  when you fell in love  for the first time  basically like  junior high  high school  whenever the fuck it happened  I had real falling in love  for the first time  where you couldn't do  anything else  with your life  nothing  encompassing  nothing  you couldn't even  hang out with your family  you couldn't do shit  you would just sit around  waiting for the next time  you could either talk to her  or see her  you had no idea  what was happening to you  no nothing  you were just being swept  away by this  what the fuck  is this emotion  I'm in love  I'm not gonna see my friends  my parents are gonna be mad 
[02:06:00]  cause I'm not doing anything  I'm supposed to be doing  I'm just obsessing  over this girl  you were saying  it was too much pressure  for a young kid like that  yeah you're completely  out of your mind  you're completely  out of your mind  I was in 5th grade  and I fell in love  with Suzanne Moore  oh that's poor  oh she was  she was freckly  and she was big  and I all of a sudden  she was big  was she a fatty  I had  no she was tall 
[02:06:30]  she was kind of tall  oh tall girl  yeah  and I have a picture of it  literally  of me  all of a sudden  I went from  being a kid  like a t-shirt  to wearing  a button down shirt  and I rolled up  the sleeves  like just up to the arm  and then unbuttoned  like to mid chest  and I had like  a little communion  necklace  that I had  I wore that  so the chain  would be like  right in the V  of where my shirt  was on  and I'm like  walking  very calculated  all of a sudden  I'm like  Don Watt 
[02:07:00]  I really thought  I was like  Saturday Night Fever  like John Travolta  John Travolta  yeah  you were like  Travolta  but not in the  ways that you  thought  you were like  Travolta  on the steps  of a plane  with another  photographer  spitting adieu  to a close friend  giving a hug  kiss  but we used to  we used to go  there was this  little nature trail  and we used to  walk down the  nature trail  and make out  and it was so  early that  we didn't even  know what  making out was  we would just  smoosh our  faces together 
[02:07:30]  yeah  didn't open  a mouth at all  on TV  but all day  all night  I would wait  and think about  when we get  back on the  nature trail  would your genitals  get funny  would they get a little  funny  they got hilarious  they got hilarious  like what is  going on down  there  that's exactly  there was this  girl named  Donna Yonkey  spelt with a J  I think they were  from New Mexico  of course they were  and they moved  to Central Islip  in the apartment  complex I lived in 
[02:08:00]  and this girl  was I guess  the grade  lower than me  and I was in  like probably  third grade  so this is really  early on  and we used to  go down into  the basement  of the apartments  and make out  which amounted  to like you said  closed mouth  just squishing  lips together  and trying to  move your head  around and look  like Cary Grant  it's true  all you would do  is wiggle your head  a little  wiggle your head  and then looking  around when you  heard a sound  hoping you know  somebody wasn't  looking 
[02:08:30]  and this bitch  this little  fucking bitch  broke your heart  I wanted to  keep doing this  because it was great  it made my genitals  feel funny  and then she started  going out with  this other kid  down  Michael  started going  down with  Michael  into the basement  I saw her  and Michael  go down the steps  to the basement  one day  and I'm like  what's fun  that was like  walking into a  bedroom and seeing  your wife with  another man  at least she  wasn't going  down with  Leroy  and as a matter 
[02:09:00]  of fact  in the centralized  apartment buildings  there was one  apartment that was  just for black  people  like all the other  apartment buildings  were white people  white people  white people  they put all  the black people  in one apartment  this is 1971  72 maybe  and yeah  if I saw her  go down those  stairs  oh boy  good riddance  remember that  empty feeling  though you had  when it  fucking fell apart  because that was  a disaster  of an emotion  too  how do you  handle that 
[02:09:30]  at a young age  I had to stand  at the bus stop  with them  and I'm like  fucking I got  my dumb school bag  and I'm looking  at them like  you fucking  prick  it takes a little  piece of you  away forever  that was it  that was a little  chunk taken away  of all the chunks  that have been  taken away  that made me  what I am  right now  as I fucking  sit here  a bitter man  afraid of things  being taken away  that's why you  hate Obama  you know  ah yeah see  did he go to  the basement  with Donnie Yonkey  he probably did 
[02:10:00]  he probably did  that was smooth  more importantly  how's the cookie  Tom  you just had one  amazing  oh  it's really good  it's solid  not too dry  it's too dry  it's a solid  mom cookie  yeah it's a mom  cookie alright  it was  it's homemade  that thing's terrible  homemade mom cookies  from Sam's mom  well no I thought  they were like  deli store bought  and I was like  these are good  for like being  in a deli  that's great  yeah  I didn't know  how to kiss a girl  so I asked Jill  I've told a story 
[02:10:30]  in the air before  it was in fourth grade  we were like  in the woods area  I'm like  I want to ask you  something  she's like  okay  I'm like  you know my favorite  band is right  that's right  every time I hear this  I fucking cringe  and she just ignored me  she shuts off  cigars and scotch  says  she should have went  queen  cigars and scotch 
[02:11:00]  always with the funny one  maybe David Bowie  oh chip  I just don't know  how to ruin everything  oh my god  that's brutal  how humiliating  that's great  I remember when  I first got back  we would make out  and squish faces  and then  I just didn't know  what to do with my hands  and then I was like  I went up  I was holding her skin  like her back  oh yeah  crazy  and I went back  I was like  I think I got to second  I think I got to second  back  my friends were like 
[02:11:30]  why you took off her bra  nah you were picked off  at first  that's what happened  you were out thrown  yeah exactly  you ran the wrong way  you ran to the on deck circle  and spun around  but speaking of which  you remember the pressure  of trying to get that bra  off casually  oh for good  because it wasn't all about  like I'm going to just  take your fucking bra off  it was like  you're trying to work it  8,000 steps  fuck  you're 8,000 steps forward  for a smushy mouth kiss  it was so much pressure  you never saw one before 
[02:12:00]  you had no idea  how it worked  and if she was a bit big  on top  there was a bunch of snaps  what was that about  yeah the first training bras  holy fuck  like chastity belts  it looks like those  final  it looks like that final place  they fasten the cables  on the Verrazano bridge  like that final  big block of cement  and you're there  with your little  9 year old hand  just trying to get those  9 foot diameter bolts off  because you finally  get to an age  like we all know  what's going on here  let's just do this  but back then  it was like  everything had to be  like fucking  undercover 
[02:12:30]  and you knew  if it wasn't smooth  it was over  it would kill the whole thing  kill the mood  because she wanted  to make believe  it's just  you know  there's an oopsie happening  right  maybe this will work  we had talked  also previously  about how square dancing  in gym class  was a sexual experience  in a way  because  you went to school  with these girls  all the time  you saw them  but you never  touched them at all  unless you know  you were going out  smooshy face  with one girl  but these are just  the regular girls  you're with  and now you're 
[02:13:00]  holding hands  like you're all  in the circle  so you're just  holding hands  with a girl  was like  and then I'm like  oh I don't want  Pam Bernfeld  could you move  could you move  because I want  that girl's hand  everybody was moving  around  everyone's jockeying  for positions  who the fuck  are you going to get  until the last second  but then when you're  doing the promenade  and you got your arm  around the girl  it was like  wow I'm touching  this girl  and you fucking  again you're just  like ah  you're freaking out  I want to go back  to the bra thing  again though 
[02:13:30]  because another memory  so it's four snaps  four  you get the first one  done  you're like  alright  second one done  and if you ever  got to the fourth  where it just  was unleashed  you're fucking  you would start  fucking foaming  well you get more  you get more  tension on each one  so the last one  has got a lot  of tension  but sometimes  you would only  allow  these girls  were weird  sometimes they  would only allow  you to do one  or two  and keep the other  two on  and even if you  got all four off 
[02:14:00]  and that thing  went free  but if it went  free  you still then  had to come back  to the front  and try and go up  and that was  a whole  you could be  stopped there  it was a minefield  oh man was it  a minefield  that's why  this was the  cure all for the  stop  you got it  you got it  what happened  jeepers  you know what  my god damn  template's ripped  and by the way  it's old school  by the way  you just dated 
[02:14:30]  yourself  because Mr. Coffee  is like square  dancing in gym  class  yeah we did  square dancing  did you square  dance in gym  yeah  it was before  back's box  well it probably  ended with this  whole PC shit  where like look  we can't have  fucking you know  girls and boys  touching each other  in class  because like  Anna said in the  past  that's like  having sex  when you're  11-12 years old  that's like  holy fuck  that's hardcore  sex  could you imagine  being the teacher  like when all the  kids came back 
[02:15:00]  from that class  all sweaty  their eyes big  oh man  boners  just fucking  boners in  everyone's pants  pre-cum in  everybody's  trying to teach  them about the  Gettysburg Address  good luck  oh they had to  know  they were just  yeah cause you  know what just  happened  the period before  you're like  did that just  happen  was I basically  having sex  with that girl  it was like  Pavlov's dog  when you heard  the motor  that opened up  that accordion  door at the gym  and combined  the girls and  boys side of the  gym  you'd hear like  yeah you're just 
[02:15:30]  freaking out  swinging from the  ropes  just in heat  sniffing crotches  imagine being the  girl that was  the first one  to get tits  before she  breasts  yeah  I mean think  about the  torture that  that girl  went through  I remember  this girl in  6th grade  we came back  from 5th to  6th grade  it was our  last year at  the elementary  school  which was 6th  grade  and she came  back from  summer vacation  she was tall  and had big 
[02:16:00]  tits  and that was  it  you know  she was  34D  first name was  Jerry  holy fuck  and she was  big and  and I  I was  looking at  her tits  once  and I  couldn't  stop  and she  kicked me  in the nuts  just fucking  kicked me  in the balls  boy she  really had  a problem  with being  the only  girl with  giant tits  in there  there's always  one that  had to start  it off  for the rest  of the gals  ours was  just a  just a wreck  of her face  like huge 
[02:16:30]  buck teeth  and cock  and cock  eyed  but the  biggest boobs  we'd ever  seen  she was  so popular  and so  hated  all the  same  for us  it was  so confusing  do I  do I  think she's  pretty  well  we're gonna  bring her  in now  Tom  let's get  in here  oh she's  a babe  now  we had a  girl  34Ds  she wore  an army  t-shirt  no bra  it trolled  everyone  insane  oh my god  in school  yes  in school  the power  crazy  the power 
[02:17:00]  she allowed  to even  come to  suck  she would  just bounce  they would  just bounce  across the  cafeteria and  we'd all  lose our  fucking minds  did anybody  get to suck  them  like anything  suck  unfortunately  I wasn't  in that  circle  you know  google plus  everyone  I wasn't  in that  one  wasn't in  the tit  sucking  circle  unfortunately  she was  like  she might  as well  have been  28  really  she was  so  unobtainable  it was  so hard  to find  most of us  I think  she was  already  dating 
[02:17:30]  college  guys  as a  15 year  old  one of  those  girls  you know  why  it was  so hard  to find  a place  to do  anything  sexually  with girls  in school  like where  where are you  going  yeah like when  Jimmy said  the woods  it's like  if you could  find some woods  to the woods  let's go to  the woods  I'm me  a tree fork  dude I'll go  local  I'll go local  Oldfield's junior high  they had that  little pond  I don't know  if it's still  there  and during  lunch period  if you were  brave  you went  and took  the walk 
[02:18:00]  around the  pond  and there  was smoking  cigarettes  smoking pot  and people  making out  which was  like hardcore  sex  I got a  brace faced  blowjob  at Lahey  across the  street  from  Oldfield's  Harborfield's  yeah  this is last  week  Harborfield's  oh no  I think  Lahey was  Harborfield's  Lahey was  right across  from Harborfield's  yeah  no Oldfield's  had this pond  and the teachers  would go back  every once in a while  but there was  all sorts of  you know  there was a  system set up  to make sure  everyone knows  the teachers 
[02:18:30]  are coming  I went to  Blydenberg Park  once  and this was  during like  high school  Blydenberg Park  and they were  having a Girl Scout  Jamboree thing  there  and I knew  a couple of the  girls that were  Girl Scouts  so I went  into their tent  I totally snuck in  went into their tent  and they're hanging out  in their panties  and t-shirts  and I'm in there  and they were like  playing cards and stuff  and I just thought  this was great  and then the  one of the  camp fucking  head camp leader  things  were checking on  the tents  I had to lay down 
[02:19:00]  I had to lay down  in the corner  of the tent  while these  four girls  sat on me  to cover me up  and folded their  legs  and I just sat there  with four  Girl Scouts  wearing panties  sitting on me  like a chair  I was like  I wish  she would never leave  this moment  would never end  it was amazing  you popped your own  tent  meanwhile they're in  the fucking tent  they've had little  period smells 
[02:19:30]  oh I don't care  a few dumps  that were wiped  but not showered  she always has to  ruin it  that doesn't ruin it  she ruins it  it was great  they always had game  though  I was staring at  underoos  that is pretty hot  I'll bet you the  counselor came in  and saw you  and just jerked off  to what a lucky devil  you are  it was a different  time  there were those  moments  we used to go to  a cabin upstate  too with these  girls  and it was  another place  where you could  actually have sex  close to the woods  another woods  thing  and it was 
[02:20:00]  one of those  things where  you couldn't  sleep  you didn't  want to sleep  because that  was wasting  fucking valuable  time of being  in the same  bed or sleeping  bag with a  naked girl  and you just  the second I saw  the sky turn  that bluish  color and you  hear birds chirp  and I'm like  fuck man  it's over  you're gonna have  to get up  this sucks  those were the  ones you just  wanted  that was it  you could die  right there  and be completely  happy if you  were 15 and  dead  and think about  that like that 
[02:20:30]  memory is so  burned in there  and all the girls  that you've been  with since then  you don't even  remember  but those early  ones are so  potent  because you  really had to  work it  and it was a  new part of your  brain opening up  you're just like  what is this shit  you never felt that  before  and everything  you accomplished  was  everything you  accomplished  every step  forward was  just huge  all fodder  to tell your  friends  oh my god  yeah  jeez  I was getting  putsy all the  time  I fuck like  30 girls a 
[02:21:00]  year  shut up  Chip  I'm so green  with envy  about that  I'm sticking  it in all  the holes  getting them  creamy down  there  how old  Chip  how old  were you  the time  I was like  four I was  getting them  creamy  and sticking  it in  climb on  and just  pound it  until it  was like  melba toast  or those  cookies  same thing  this should  probably break  now  Chip doesn't 
[02:21:30]  put a good  spin on  I just  got a lot  of puss  were you guys  lame when you  talked about it  too  like we used  to go  did he get  patched  last night  oh god  ew  you said  that  I'll throw  myself under  the bus  he blew  up  pirate  they wrecked  a Robin  Williams movie  we were so  fucking lame  we were the  nerds of high  school  I was  getting  patched  last night  I was  getting shit  so it's like  if you got  patched it was a  big deal 
[02:22:00]  and you tell  your friends  you got  patched  you were  Chip and you  didn't even  know it  I know  you got lots  of patched  so many  patches  you're like  a patch  factory  it was all  about heavy  petting and  stuff  most of the  girls  especially  Harborfield  supposedly  had the  reputation  they didn't  go all the  way  so if you  got patched  it was a  big fucking  deal  I wouldn't  have said  that at  my awful  times  you'd be  offended  by that  I didn't  say it to  be cool 
[02:22:30]  I'm embarrassed  how old  were you  saying that  16  I was  a late  bloomer  I didn't  mature until  my senior  year of  high school  really  the girls  didn't come  around  into girls  I did  well  because  the 10th  graders  because I  was more  on their  level  when I was  a senior  girls my  own age  no fuck  no man  and no  junior high  stuff  a little  bit  I was  always  so small  for my  age  I don't  think I  had pubic 
[02:23:00]  hair until  I was  like 17  I was  a late  you were  almost  17  it must have  been nice  and calming  like did we  go through  junior high  and not  be losing  it yet  I didn't  lose my  virginity  until I  was 18  I literally  last night  had a  dinner with  all these  junior high  high school  people  it was like  10 of us  and we see  them every  year  and it's  all the  girls that  we started  with  it's all  the first  it's all  the junior  high first 
[02:23:30]  bra strap  and we're  who does  this  what's that  every year  you do this  every year  we do this  around Christmas  we get together  it's crazy  and the girls  look great  come on  really  I mean  yeah  for 40  they look  great  and all  the guys  are just  like still  plotting  because  it's the  first ones  that it ever  happened to  it's so potent  and even if  they don't look  great to us  it's just  like the  most amazing  it's like  a model  we're just  all plotting  how can I  get them  back  how can I 
[02:24:00]  get them  back to the  woods  it's things  you thought  you forgot  about  when I used  to still go  to high school  reunions  you go back  and you get  right back  to that mindset  and all these  memories come back  like oh yeah  he liked her  they're still  working in this  and that  and you realize  you're not  really that much  older than  when you left  nah not really  same shit  nah same  did your wife  go with you  and their spouses  no no spouses  allowed  hey  oh that means  you guys  so it's  literally  you and your  guy friends  me and like  there's like  five guy friends  and there's 
[02:24:30]  like six girls  where do you guys  go  go to a restaurant  and then to a bar  last night we just  went straight to this  bar  the cemetery  hang out and drink  beers  did your wife get  annoyed at that  or no  no she doesn't  no because  for her  we tell  and partially  it's true  is that  it's gonna be  all high school  stories  you don't want  to sit  and hear  about  all the good  old days  about bras  coming off  yeah  first time  you got patch  it used to be  just guys  and then all of a  sudden the girls  heard about it  and then they  started showing up  and now it's  now  this is 
[02:25:00]  this is the  this is the plot  now and I'm gonna  I'll probably blow it  but in high school  we one time  rented this  beach house  like this  we were all at  this beach house  somehow  maybe someone's  parents or something  and it was just  one of those times  where we were  all kind of  screwing around  just we just  lost our minds  it was like  everybody was all  of a sudden  like making out  with people you  never even like  before  it was like that  this is the worst  of the Opie and  Anthony show  hey asshole  you guys suck  serious XM 
[02:25:30]  I don't know  I was more of a  Wichita lineman  guy myself  I don't know that  one  I like that song  got a little  Wichita lineman  here's how you do it  hey bitch  get Wichita lineman  oh shit  that's how you handle  things in this  fucking comedy  yeah  all this shit  reminds me  it just reminds me  of taking that 
[02:26:00]  trip to California  in the Pinto  with my dad  my brother  and his girlfriend  my brother's girlfriend  my dad's girlfriend  and driving from  New York to California  in a Ford Pinto  wow  was that a good ride  that suck  there was a cooler  in the back  for all of dad's beers  and we used to have  to be in the back  and there was a little  hatchback  and the seat  wasn't even up  so we had to lay down  the whole time  and then the cooler 
[02:26:30]  from where to where  from New York  to Los Angeles  you had to lay down  the whole time  yeah we stopped once  in St. Charles  I think St. Charles  Minnesota or something  did you try to sit up  South Dakota  St. Charles  South Dakota  I don't even know  was he drinking  the whole time  oh yeah  drinking the whole time  wait did you try  to sit up  it's a hatchback  and a Pinto  you couldn't really  sit up  we could sit  kind of Indian style  a little  if we ducked down  your dad was an asshole  oh yeah  sorry 
[02:27:00]  but he was  and then  well you know  he had his own agenda  and the cooler  started leaking  hold on  but I gotta slow you down  yeah  so New York to LA  you have to lay down  the whole time  you can't even look  out the window  at America  well it was a hatchback  so you could kind of  look out the window  I don't think it was a window  so the back was  yeah yeah  the back  so there were  a couple of pillows  so we propped the pillows up  behind the driver and passenger seat  and kind of lay down  so you look out the back window  yeah so you look out the back window  that's not as bad 
[02:27:30]  I get so car sick doing that  and it was  well as a kid  but this cooler  would like  we would sweat  the cooler  so I woke up  like with cold freezing water  on my leg  and he's like  alright come on  we're gonna check into a hotel  it was this  one horse town  fucking hotel  we checked into  was it like a five store hotel  oh this was a piece of shite hotel  in the middle of nowhere  but we stopped at a few places  we stopped  and saw  Mount Rushmore 
[02:28:00]  nice  and then we saw the Badlands  in South Dakota  and  then we dipped down south  and saw the Grand Canyon  nice  and the Great Meteor Crater  well I guess he's not an asshole  that sounds like a good trip  no it's kind of fun  but he was  he was something there  and at night  he would drive  with a beer  a beer between his legs  and the fucking  and his .38  in the console  just  driving around  like yeah  that's how you do it  oh he had a gun all the time  oh yeah  he was another one  all the time 
[02:28:30]  well not  not quite as legal  as his son Anthony  but  you know  you're a lot like him  well  like to drive  I don't want to say fast  but  he wasn't a fast driver  he was a weavy driver  he could weave  with the best of us  were you ever scared  in the car with him  petrified  yeah yeah  there were many times  I was petrified  of falling off the edge  of the Ortega Highway  in California  going to Lake Elsinore  and it was one of those roads  that were just like 
[02:29:00]  these are  it's a movie road  yeah yeah yeah  it's a fucking movie road  like that fucking  what was that movie  with the truck  Empire Strikes Back  chasing Dennis Weaver  the whole movie  Duel  you ever seen Duel  oh Jesus no  yeah that's  that's the road  it was like  it sounds like  the Pacific Coast Highway  yeah but  the PCH  but without  like the ocean  it was just  it was  just fucking  sheer cliffs  that's what the PCH  is all about  yeah  and there'd be  these big 
[02:29:30]  Conrock cement trucks  that would come  barreling down  the other side  and dad's just  kind of looking down  and he'd be like  hey  on the CB  he's trying to drive  drink a beer  steer down this road  on the CB  man  it's the Paisano Cowboy  anyone out there  got your ears on  Paisano Cowboy  and then  wait wait  that was his handle  yeah  oh he rules  it's the Paisano Cowboy  I take back  the asshole comment  he rules 
[02:30:00]  the Paisano Cowboy  you never said that  before  oh no no  I forgot  I just remembered  his handle  was the Paisano Cowboy  and one of the  greatest things  to watch  was him  when he'd be  on the CB  and he'd key down  and he'd be talking  and he'd have to  make a turn  so he'd put his  hand with the CB  mic  on the steering wheel  and you know how  you just whip  the wheel around  he'd do that  and the little  curly mic cord  would get caught  around the steering column  and his hand would be like 
[02:30:30]  god damn  son of a bitch  he's all pissed  and can't steer now  interrupting his driving  even more  the Paisano Cowboy  Paisano Cowboy  and this was me  look  hey it's Wrangler  it's Wrangler  Paisano Cowboy  you got your ears on  and  what was your handle  Paisano Cowboy  I was a Wrangler  yeah we know that  ew  I didn't know he was  the Wrangler  we've talked about that  as you should have been  I was the Wrangler  because I worked at 
[02:31:00]  Jimmy Jackson's  Rent String there  and I used to have to  wrangle up the horses  and  you know  got your ears on  this is the Wrangler  the Wrangler  and a lot of times  dad didn't answer back  and I got very nervous  as to his whereabouts  and his safety  oh you would try to talk  to your dad on the CB  yeah yeah  because he wasn't home  and I was like  you know  there were no cell phones  or anything  and you were hungry  so I was starving  and I would try to  you know  I would try to be like  I'm like  hey it's Wrangler 
[02:31:30]  Paisano Cowboy  got your ears on  and then sometimes  this old bag  Tiny Bubbles  would come on  she'd go  Wrangler  this is Tiny Bubbles  hi Tiny Bubbles  it's like  yeah  why don't you just  call for your dad  like maybe every  every half hour  instead of every  five minutes  oh  I'd be like  oh okay  Tiny Bubbles  they were telling you  to shut the hell up  because I was always  Breaker  Breaker 1-9  Breaker 1-9  for Paisano Cowboy  with my daddy 
[02:32:00]  you just wanted your daddy  because he was probably out  you know  getting lit up  at the depot  or at the swallows inn  what does Breaker 1-9 mean?  that means  hi  I'm on channel 19  I would like to  get on the channel  and request  to talk to somebody  do you interrupt people  when you say that?  no  you wait for people  this conversation  to be done  it was pretty much  the phone ringing  so it'd be like  Breaker 1-9  and then it's like  go ahead  and then 
[02:32:30]  you kind of have permission  you don't just get on  and go  hey  what are you doing?  you'd be like  you gotta break first  break  make sure  there's not a conversation  going on here  motherfucker  there were rules  do people really  how could you stop  somebody from interrupting  if someone kept interrupting?  you couldn't  oh you couldn't  you couldn't  it was a constant  barrage of  hey motherfucker  you're not allowed  to curse on the  radio  yeah fuck you  you fuck fuck  and that's what  that's what the CB  turned into 
[02:33:00]  so people still have  CB's right?  wow I think only  truckers have them  but do truckers still use them?  I think the truckers  still use them  yeah  to talk to each other  on an open line  yeah and now  it must be easy  because you know  you don't have all  the riffraff you had  in the 70's  when everybody  had a CB  people were getting  bass stations  at their house  we had a bass station  I had a mic  like fucking  like in  The Shining  all the police  K to K12  yeah  I forgot about  bass stations 
[02:33:30]  we had one too  a bass station  and then you had  your antennas  on your car  you had to get them  matched  it was always hard  to match your antennas  did you just go out  in our case  just out to our driveway  just to hang out  on the CB  and talk on the CB  yeah on a summer night  yeah  it's dark out  you're bored with TV  your parents  hogging it up  watching their shit  of course  that's why  yeah we'd go outside  and just turn on  the CB radio  and wow  that's how I met  the Dreamweaver  dude come on  of course  oh really  yeah met her  on the CB  I had a much better 
[02:34:00]  handle than Anthony  oh god  his was the faggiest  come on  wait what was it  I think it was  Apple Tree Boy  no not quite  what was it  we did this break  I don't remember  I might have been here  I listened to  like a best of  you'll find out  now what was it  I probably was away  I might have been on the road  oh no you got it  oh boy  you think the wrangler  is bad  very good  you think the wrangler  is bad  people know  see people know  Jimmy you don't pay attention  I was probably gone  you need to pay more attention 
[02:34:30]  closer attention  I don't know if Jimmy  was even  I was probably away  when we first started  talking about  well  I was  11  maybe 12  maybe  and  my  CB handle  was  I can't believe  I'm about to do this  people know  yeah I know  Jimmy's not gonna make fun  you promise you're not  gonna make fun Jimmy  yes  you sure  you're 11

[02:36:30]  when you're 11  you think that's cool  diamond dust  it sounds like  mysterious  you're not  you could beat  the shit out of me  no believe me  I'm just being honest  this is rough  it's terrible  Wrangler's not much  better  no it's awful  well Wrangler was  at least it had a reason  you know  I was  the wrangler  the rum variety  there is a reason  you were fucking  taking loads in your  rectum  perfect reason  you never  catcher would have been  great  so would Swallower  a little  crab baby  cocksucker  you got your ears on  crab baby  cocksucker

[02:42:00]  I don't know  what's the problem  in this song  I got a little white  in my beard  my girl's got hair  like Juan Epstein  that is horrible  what are they  hauling crystal meth  what's the problem here  I don't know  what was happening  alright go back  let's see if we can  figure out the problem  the bears are in the air  the cops are all chasing  the big convoy  because it's kind of hard  to find 400 tractor trailers  but now they're ripping up  their paperwork  they're becoming rebels  and we leave it all  on the scale  they're bypassing  the scales  are they 
[02:42:30]  it's crazy  they're going against  the system  but what happened  I don't know  what are they doing  I don't know  I'm so frustrated  we got 4,000 pounds  of kiddie porn  on a pallet  in the back truck  little bunch of Asian boys  with large white genitals  in their mouths  we've got to get  it's California  they brought up  some reinforcements  from the Illinois  National Guard  there's armored cars  and tanks  and jeeps  and rigs  of every size  yeah them chicken coops  was full of bears 
[02:43:00]  and choppers  filled the skies  well we shot the line  we went for broke  with a thousand  screaming trucks  and 11 long haired  friends of Jesus  in a chartreuse  microbus  hippies  you're a rubber duck  to a sod buster  come on there  you have 10-4 sod buster  listen you want to  put that microbus  in behind that  suicide jockey  yeah he's hauling dynamite  and he needs  all the help  he can hear  oh  well we laid a script  for the jersey shore  and prepared  to cross the line  I could see the bridge  was lined with bears 
[02:43:30]  but it didn't have  a doggone dime  I says pink pen  this here's a rubber duck  we just ain't gonna pay  no toll  so we crashed  the gate  doing 98  as this  let them truckers  roll 10-4  I stopped this  you don't like that  no this is terrible  what's going on  I don't know  they gotta get to  the jersey shore  because we're  holding flip flops  for the kids  maybe they just did  all their crystal meth  before they left  but do they expect  to get away with this  I don't know  what are they doing  why not just pay the toll  why are you crashing 
[02:44:00]  the gate at 98  what is going on  what is going on  this is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show  Sirius XM  I've gotten so bad  with needing my nipples  played with  how do I get out of that  say my dick won't stay hard  unless my nipples  are being played with  it's crazy  cut your nipples off  Opie that's not the solution  I was looking for  well we don't need them  we're connected everything  we just cut them off  and then stitch it together  but I am wired weird  because you don't  take your shirt off  at the beach anyway  so cut off your nipples 
[02:44:30]  no because then  I'll just go to diddle  and I'll just hit  and scar tissue  scar tissue  scar tissue  I hate that I have  to diddle them  with my bent wrists  diddle diddle diddle  with your bent wrists  yeah  like a T-Rex  I've gotten so far  I envy you  that you don't need that  like this is a turn on  the feeling of it  they are getting hard  as I do this to myself  but I don't  I don't know  what this means  I discovered it  in my mid-twenties  while I was jerking off  like I happened to  brush my nipples  one time  and went oh boy  really  I used to jerk off  not that you care  but I would take my thumb 
[02:45:00]  and hold it against  my balls tightly  like I would have  my hand between my legs  and I would just jerk off  and that pressure  against my balls  felt good  like my ball vein  but then I  the ball vein  stop with your  technical medical jargon  yeah I don't want  to make it all sexy  but then I hit the nipples  and I just began  to require that  hmm  not like you're doing  you're doing it  like Obie's doing  like a  I don't know how to do it  you're doing it  like I like a real light  it's like really light  like this  and that turns on  it just feels good  they are getting hard  is that  turning it on 
[02:45:30]  I mean  when my nipples get hard  I don't know  it just  I don't know  I don't like when my nipples get hard  actually  they feel like  I'm embarrassed now  I just got my nipples hard  what  did you know guys  nipples get hard  it  well  yeah when it's like  cold and stuff  you don't like your nipples  like Anthony  no I'm not  I'm not a big  I envy that  not a big upper part  of the body  do you like them  pinched hard and stuff  not really hard  I've had them pinched  a little hard  it was kind of sexy  but not really hard  nipple clamps  any of that shit 
[02:46:00]  no I  no I'm not that far gone  no  I envy you guys  though you're just normal  like that  you know we got  fucking issues  you'll get your  fucking  yeah yeah  but I mean just to not  need your nipples  played with  can you understand  how envious I am  do you need your  nipples played with  no  Sam  I don't need my  nipples played with  Sam  I don't need  this is tell the truth  time  I don't need my  nipples played with  like can you just  climb  I can't just climb on  and go chest to chest  and bang like that  I wish I could 
[02:46:30]  I'm so far shot  I've jerked off too much  what the fuck  I got BO today  do you  I don't like that  are you pitting out  yeah man  god damn man  I don't have any  deodorant right now  I'm gonna get some  doterant  yeah  I ran out yesterday  ah whatever  fuck that smells man  I did shower this morning  so it's whatever  happened  I have to  I'm a greasy mess  I never showered  before this radio  I just don't  no no  the night before  night before guy 
[02:47:00]  you don't got  beautiful hair like me  when I wake up in  the morning  it's greasy  greasy  nah  it's gotta be  night before  I couldn't  fucking wake up  that early  and start  fucking moving  around like that  it's a two minute  shower  shower's like  fucking aerobics  Jesus  your arms are up  you're going  you're shampooing  then you gotta wash  you're doing things  it's too early  to move around  like that  how do you  stand the shower  on my head  what's that  it's crazy  fill that asshole 
[02:47:30]  up with water  but no I'm saying  do you have a position  that you stand in  in the shower  like when you zone  out under hot water  I like to zone out  under hot water  I have a red light  in my shower  oh nice  it's fucking really  great  you can show out  yeah  but do you have  a way you stand  or do you just  kind of stand  there with your  arms at your  sides  I can't have  the water  just hitting  my face  too long  even though  that's a good  feeling  but having  hot water  run over your  shoulders  like that  you just stand  there like  you kind of  hunch your shoulders  over  and just put  your head down  that I could 
[02:48:00]  stand there  fucking hours  is that womb  shit like  the way people  I get the microphone  above me  and pointing down  and I'll stand  there like this  I just kind of  stand there like that  like it's really weird  oh wait wait  you put your  my arms cross  like I'm dead  over my chest  over your chest  I lean forward  and I allow it  to hit the top  left part of my  shoulder  and kind of  wash over me  you're a fucking  weirdo  I love that  you really are  I literally  for an hour  will stand  like that  I love this  you just do  very different  that is like 
[02:48:30]  what is  and only hitting  one side  no no no  I all get  you have to stand  one way or the other  I'm getting  my whole body  is getting it  I just prefer  it on the left side  I can take it  on the right side  of the shoulder  like symmetrical  that  I'm into  the symmetry  of the whole thing  it's got to hit  the back of the neck  and roll over the shoulders  like very symmetrically  it hits me  when it hits me  the back of my neck  it hits the back of my neck  it does go over  my entire shoulders  but I can just stand there  there's something about  that warm fucking water 
[02:49:00]  hitting the back of your neck  so you like it  on the back of your neck too  it's a weird place  to like it  that's instant  water cum  whatever  I think your arms folded  isn't too weird  because you know  it's comfortable  and you  it's a little warmer  that way  the shower is weird  as soon as you're  outside that water  even though you're still  in the vicinity  of all that water  and warmth  you get cold  you gotta have  your radiant  heated floor  that's why showering  with someone in general  just sucks  you need a double shower  you need a lot of  like spigots  you need a big shower 
[02:49:30]  a lot of spigots  a lot of spigots  and you can't share  like soaps and stuff  nothing worse than  standing there waiting  just naked  and you're cold  done with the shampoo  fuck  one shower head  you get cold  but there's nothing better  than that soapy hand  oh yeah  fucking grabbing your dick  like oh well  now we're showering  well that's a nice  how do you do  there's a fine  how do you do  I've never been  jerked off in the shower  no 
[02:50:00]  I don't know if I've  ever jerked off  you've never jerked off  in the shower  yeah maybe once  or twice in my life  literally I'm not  a bathroom jerker  there we go  you don't jerk off  in the shower  oh right  no I never really did that  Patrice has a very  funny joke  about jerking off  in the shower  and coming down  the drain  it's one of his  older jokes  one day a baby's  gonna pop out  like how much  he jerks off  yeah  and I always thought  when he did that joke  I can't relate to  jerking off in the shower  I just can't  fucking  clean up so easy  well on the toilet  of course not 
[02:50:30]  that's a little wacky  I guess because I'm an edger  and I like to spend  a long time  like my feet are all  pointed out  and creepy  when I'm jerking off  I was fucking jerking off  yesterday  looking at the computer  for probably  45 minutes  and I could come  and I just keep stopping  so I can't come  you should get a kid  in your life  yeah  that'll help you  40  come quick  45 minutes  I don't have 45 minutes  for nothing  but I would just  resent the kid  see I wouldn't help me  not be a pig  I would resent the kid  that you can't be doing 
[02:51:00]  what you want to do  yeah I would be  a shitty parent  thank you  but in the shower  it's awesome  you got soaps  and shampoos  and body  fucking washers  the only problem  is when you take  that first pee afterwards  I don't know  what the fuck  happens with the pee hole  maybe we can talk  to Dr. Steve  about that  oh wow  you get that  yeah you get  the cleaning product  that's meant to  take the grease  out of the hair  and it gets inside  the urethra  the urinary tract  and it'll cause  a little burning  stinging 
[02:51:30]  he gets better  at that  every time  but the skin  the skin that's  irritated  if you take that  and you liquefy it  you can make  wine out of it  we're calling them  right now  because now we need  to know the answer  because it's a really  bizarre thing  that happens  when you use  those shampoos  and stuff  to whack off  that's an irritant  you learn that  early on  never use soap  or shampoo  yeah but it feels  so good  do you remember  you're done  in the shower  or whatever  and I don't know 
[02:52:00]  a half hour later  you're now taking  your leak  and you know  it's gonna happen  it's burning  but you know  and you're just like  but I have to go  and then you do it  and just take the pain  for a second or two  I didn't get the pain  pissing  I got the pain  when I was actually  in the middle  of jerking  like the soap  got in there  and it like  swells up  around the hole  and my dick hole  looked like  it was going  me  me  me  like a bass 
[02:52:30]  you ever watch  a movie  The Sandlot  with the kids  and the kid goes  forever  forever  that's what  it looks like  it just goes  the bottom part  of it goes  me  it's like  in The Sopranos  the singing bass  that they had  mounted  that reminded  him of  big pussy  yes  your dick  looks like  the singing bass  when you jerk  over in the shower  you gotta stand up  what's wrong  with standing up  forever  it's 
[02:53:00]  wow  it's harder  to do for me  standing up  is cool though  because your legs  get a little wobbly  which is kind of  fun  do you take  less than 10 minutes  to whack off  yeah  I can be a speed  jerker  or I can take  my time  it depends  on what's  going on  I guess  sometimes I do  want to take  my time  like anyone else  and other times  like yeah  let's fucking  rub one out  as we like to say  a standing  someone's  going a standing  jerk  with a question  mark  it's like  yeah  there's the  standing jerk  yeah  I've done it  in people's 
[02:53:30]  over the years  people have  fucking stood up  and jerked off  standing jerk  is pretty common  I think so  as a matter of fact  Dr. Steve  sir  how are you  I'm alright  hi Dr. Steve  I got the question  today  so we're talking  about jerking off  in the shower  right  yeah  and you know  you look around  and sometimes  you use the soap  you use maybe  the shampoo  or whatever else  is in there  to kind of  loop things up  and after the fact  in my case  but Ant says  it happens to him  during the actual  jerking off 
[02:54:00]  let's say  for me  after the fact  half hour later  I now have to  take a leak  and all of a sudden  it burns like  a motherfucker  and it's not  an STD  or any of that  horse shit  because it goes away  by the second piss  or whatever  what is that about  well  there's  now does this  only happen  when you're doing  the standing jerk  in the shower  or is it  when you're  in the tub too  it's when you're  used to shampoo  yeah  right  right 
[02:54:30]  because you can  be in a bathtub  and the same shit  happens if you do  it that way  yes  yeah well I've  had it where  the  just if you  if you piss  after jacking  that it burns  anyway  oh fuck  you better get  that checked out  boy we're  we're the doctors  today  I don't need  no fucking  schooling to tell  you  you got something  going on  well I also  think that a lot  of times  the ejaculate  will irritate  the urethra  and when you mix  that with soap  your body just 
[02:55:00]  has to kind of  let it flow  and cleanse  that out  and get rid  of a lot  of times  the fluid  will bring  out the  irritant  the sad  thing is  that was  exactly  what I was  going to say  that's all right  me for  now it's the  voice and  the diagnosis  why does the  shampoo irritate  your pee hole  well a couple  of things  shampoo is  detergent  and so  basically what  it does is  it is a  mucolytic 
[02:55:30]  so it will  dissolve mucus  but also  you know  grease and  oil  all of the  things that  are lubing up  the inside  of your  urethra  so when  you use  things like  soap  which by  the way  just personal  experience  don't use  shampoo  outside of  the shower  and then  forget to  wash it off  afterward 
[02:56:00]  oh shit  what happens  complete  sloughing  off of the  outside of  the shaft  of the  penis  oh shit  really  oh yeah  I was  I guess  14  when I  learned  that  what happens  with a  mucolytic  mucolytic  yeah it's a  good instrument  to play  I love  how that's  what he's  telling all  his friends  you know  he got a  hooker or  something  of course  he is  and his  fucking 
[02:56:30]  penis  got all  sorts of  shit on  it  I would  have loved  to have  had a  hooker  at 14  we didn't  have any  lubricant  so we  used  shampoo  sadly  yes  that was  exactly  what it  was  was like  oh this  stuff's  squishy  I'll try  it  and then  anyway  now Dr.  Steve I'm  learning from  some fine  young listeners  a bunch of  them actually  no burn  with conditioner  yeah  here's the  problem with  conditioner  you have to  keep applying  it especially  in the shower  it doesn't 
[02:57:00]  have the  staying power  no no  it's another  clinging  constant loop  yeah  yeah  they're gonna  keep reapplying  the shower  or what you  have to do  is  find a girl  put your  back to the  stream  and then  lean your  head  in the  shower  I like  a good  30 weight  motor oil  good viscosity  I like a good  exfoliating soap  from Lush  pumice  pumice soap  yeah you 
[02:57:30]  just wrap  your  wrap your  genitals up  with that  and your  angry fist  and do it  dry of course  get one of  those soaps  with the sand  still in it  yeah  go to town  I got one  from Lush  by the way  a soap  and it  leaves a  greasy film  on me  I hate it  Lush soap  sucks  oh shit  yo  now you're  fucking  stepping on  Jimmy's  territory  well  Jimmy knows  we went  shopping  together  and we  all got  our soaps  it's a  classic  O&A  bit  we were  in Washington  right  Georgetown 
[02:58:00]  and we  all like  a bunch  of  faggots  like  spent  a couple  hundred  bucks  each  I got  like  bath  balls  and  oof  did ya  yeah  that means  your balls  have shrunk  because you've  been in the  water too  long  Jimmy knows  what a  bath  ball  is  I do  Anthony  yes  what's  bath  balls  it's a  waste  of time  is what  it is  no it's  an exploding  delight  you put  it in  it  fits  like  alka  seltzer  it's a  softball  alka  seltzer  basically  wow  and it  just  bubbles  in there 
[02:58:30]  I guess  I don't know  what it's  girls love  this shit  girls do  it  girls do  I fucking  take baths  every once in a while  Steve  what could that  greasy thing  be on the soap  it leaves a  really  like I bought  this recently  it's a big  hunk of soap  but it's a  film on me  it was fucking  awful  I had to  take it off  I had to  just go  back in the  shower  soap is  nothing more  than  fat  that's been  exposed to  a strong  alkali  and it's  through a  process called  saponification  and some  soaps  will leave 
[02:59:00]  some of the  fat  you know  they won't  go through  the whole  process  and leave  some of the  fat  unsaponified  so that  it will  give you  that sort  of skin  conditioning  thing  and some  people like  that  who the fuck  figured that  out  it's  leftover  fat  ok so  who figured  that out  Steve  do you know  ok well  I'll tell you  it's kind of  mildly  interesting  back in the  day  that's what  we aim  for on  this show  we don't  want to  raise the 
[02:59:30]  bar too  high  did animal  sacrifice  or when  they cooked  animals over  wood  the fat  would drip  out of the  wood  and then  wood ash  is a strong  alkali  and so it  would go  through a  process of  saponification  which then  would  you know  you'd usually  do this  somewhere near  water  or a river  and then  it would  bubble up  down by  the river  and people  would notice  that it 
[03:00:00]  was cleansing  before that  the way people  cleaned themselves  like in ancient  Egypt  is they'd  take  sand  and rub  it all  over their  skin  and oil  and then  scrape it  off  ew  they must  have stunk  ew  you know  how many  how do you  clean your  balls  wouldn't they  do it  with water  clean your  balls  with sand  yeah  they didn't  clean themselves  with water  yeah why  didn't they  go to the  awful  because oil  would take  oil off  so the  advance was  that now  you've got 
[03:00:30]  like  dissolved  like so  there are  these fatty  acid chains  and soap  but there's  also a  water soluble  part to the  molecule  so when  you rub  soap on  it takes  the grease  off your  skin but  then it'll  wash off  in water  and that  was the  big advance  so what  oh  sorry  we saw  at that  what was  that museum  the mutter  oh yeah  the mutter  the mutter  mutter  whatever it is  museum  in philly  it's a great  sorry  no that's cool  we saw this  woman  that had been 
[03:01:00]  buried near  a river  that had  high alkaline  content  and the  fat in her  body  and the  alkaline  mixed together  and she  literally  turned into  soap  yeah  like her  body is  laying there  encased in  glass at this  horrid museum  and she's  made of  fucking  soap  yep  and it's  a dead  body  that's  fucked up  you can  you can  make soap  out of  human fat  and we  saw that  in the  fight club  yes  fight club 
[03:01:30]  of course  yes  yes  hey  someone is  saying  that they  well it's  adam  adam in  wisconsin  never jack  off with  toothpaste  try it  as a kid  huge  he writes  ultra bright  mistake  oh god  even worse  vicks  vapo  it looks  like vaseline  you're kind  of what  you know as  a desperate  kid wanting  any type  of lube  and having  no ability  to go out  and get  it  you would  do some  things  around the  house  there was  always hand 
[03:02:00]  lotion around  really  my mom wasn't  into hand  lotion but  she was  really into  vicks  vapo  rub  oh wow  oh wow  you put that  on your chest  hey you get  a little  warming and  it's not so  bad and  then for  some reason  after you  complete the  transaction  the pain  is just  absolutely  excruciating  what is in  vicks vapo  rub that  affects your  nose  eucalyptus  I think  or menthol  menthol  something like  that  yeah your 
[03:02:30]  cock doesn't  cough after  that  which is  good  sitting there  in your  pants  you know how  many years  I spent with  vicks vapo  rub on my  chest because  of my sinuses  as a kid I  used to have  that on my  chest and  under my nose  all the time  that's the  nipple  thing  no it's  in the  middle of  my chest  I don't  I don't do  the chest  I go right  for the  nostrils  I do both  hey Dr.  Steve you  like your  nipples played  with  yeah I'm not  a big fan  of that  I've been  with women  that really  do and  it's wired  directly to  the brain  and to  the center  that releases 
[03:03:00]  oxytocin  which is  a chemical  that engenders  trust between  people  and it's the  same thing  it's the  same  like a  missing  toson  oxytocin  or something  like that  you can  make your  toast in  the morning  or something  oh jeez  chip  right  what percentage  of men  do you think  like their  nipples played  with if you  had a guess  say that again  what percentage  of men like  their nipples  played with  i don't know  i don't know  i mean maybe  hell i don't 
[03:03:30]  know  half  nah  i think  it's way  lower  i don't know  i don't know  how do i get  out of that  steve  hold on  i want to  get out  how do i  get out  of that  you said  it goes  to trust  which is  probably why  there's a  mother-child  bond during  nursing  right  exactly  right  and it's  one of the  ways that  mothers bond  with their  baby  when this  chemical is  released  the other  thing that  happens is  it's a  feedback loop  that oxytocin 
[03:04:00]  helps milk  release but  the oxytocin  itself is  you know  is a chemical  in the brain  that affects  the way that  we think  so there are  some people  out there  that are  abusing  oxytocin  they'll have  these oxytocin  parties where  they'll spray  the stuff up  their nose  and then all  of a sudden  you love  everybody  that you're  around  is it a  drug  yeah  yeah  and it's  also  it's  it's  released  during  so what  does that  do for me  when they  play with  my nipples  that's what 
[03:04:30]  it's doing  is it's  really  well I  mean it's  it's all  stimulated  you're  stimulating  your brain  and it's  in a  erogenous  zone  and you  like it  is that  why I  relax  though  it relaxes  me  yeah  absolutely  can I  change that  though  because I'm  relying on it  too heavily  well  like anything  else that we  rely on  heavily  it's best  to  back off  slowly  rather than  go cold  turkey  you know  okay  try a finger  in the ass  or something  maybe that'll 
[03:05:00]  take the place  of the nipple  play  I hope  I wish  have that free  hand  there's certainly  nothing dangerous  about it  and nothing  wrong with it  Jim  I get distracted  though it's too much  oh god  damn it  what are you  doing Sam  Sam  what are you  doing  nice nipples  they're too  long  that's probably  because he's  tugging them  all the time  he likes  nip play  dude his  nipples are  like fucking  three quarters  of an inch  long  oh god  that's  disgusting 
[03:05:30]  that's fucking  horrible  they're like  skin tags  fucking  you like that  Sam  would you suck  his man nipple  no I wouldn't  oh jesus  what's that smell  this is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony  show  on Sirius XM  what are you laughing  at already  Jimmy  just read the  Colin Quinn  tweets  oh my god  that guy  is the funniest  fucking guy  can't we get him  on the air  he's out of his  mind  did we try to  get him on the air  he's big news  today we should  get him on the air  can I ask where 
[03:06:00]  this is this from  one of the papers  yeah  or it's online  soon to be  in the papers  hey Colin  took over  twitter yesterday  man he's  he's the king  yeah he's the guy  Colin Quinn  is the king  he's the guy  the king of the  twitter  was he really  fuck yeah man  he was making  news and everything  he was making  blog sites  what Huffington  I guess  yeah Huffington  went for  oh my god  it went to  the mail  online  at the UK  yes 
[03:06:30]  what  what dummies  people are  they are  look at that  headline  I was into a lot  of bad drug  stuff  no he was  he saw that  Will Ferrell  stole Anchorman  concept  Colin Quinn  jokes that  Will Ferrell  stole Anchorman  concept  and takes  drugs  but they don't  think it's a  joke  no  because the  media is stupid  well he said  it says jokes  there  so that's  kind of  that kind of  this article  came out later  because like  three paragraphs  in it says  however it appears 
[03:07:00]  they just  fail to spot  a good  natured bit  of joshing  a good  natured bit  of joshing  don't you know  yes  yes  Colin Quinn  comedian  but this is  late in the  story  because a lot  of people  were buying  into it  for a while  what Jim's  reading is  from the  Hollywood  reporter  oh god  and the only  reason  they know  it was a  joke  is because  Colin got  scared  yeah  Colin started  going oh  fuck  maybe this  isn't a good  idea  maybe  maybe I'll  get in  trouble  look at 
[03:07:30]  the headline  on Huffington  Post  yeah  Colin Quinn  rips Will  Farrell on  Twitter  he stole  Anchorman  has a drug  problem  Colin said  I think  did he say  it on the  show  he was just  he said  to CNN  like you  guys  are so  dumb  like I'm  scared that  you don't  get it  right  some of  the quotes  read it  Jimmy  read it  I couldn't  believe  it just  made me  laugh  fuck my  Halloween  story  who gives  a fuck  this is way  better  I just  he goes  Farrell  recently  received  the Mark  Twain  award  and it  seems  Quinn  was not 
[03:08:00]  a fan  of that  it says  anybody  see Will  Farrell  at Mark  Twain  awards  last night  great  for him  I guess  like who  takes that  seriously  I know  who the  fuck  takes that  seriously  no I'm  happy for  Will  we never  really got  along at  SNL  because he  took so  many of  my ideas  but he  can take  it  he took  so many  of my  ideas  and the  whole thing  when  what's  the Lorne  Michaels  one  that's  in two  and it's  the one  that made  me laugh  yeah that  one's  hilarious  he goes  then Quinn  escalated his  comments by  saying Will  was into a lot  of bad  drug stuff 
[03:08:30]  and I don't  know if he  still is  actually not  true I  happen to  know he's  still very  much so  then Quinn  goes on to  target Lorne  Michaels  he goes  the years  at SNL  Lorne really  was kind of  messed up  over various  things and I  was the  shot caller  he's saying  he produced  SNL during  the years he  was there  and I was  the shot  caller  he called  the shots  who the  fuck  believes  that  apparently a  lot of  dumb  people  wow we  are really  dumb  oh then the  last one  he goes  he goes 
[03:09:00]  oh he said  a couple hours  later Quinn  seemed to  apologize for  his remarks  but at the  same time  threw in  another  zinger  I feel  bad about  the whole  Will  Ferrell  comments  I'll never  mention him  again if he  pays me my  residuals for  the whole  anchorman  concept  what  dumb  motherfucker  business  insider  yeah the  headline says  Colin Quinn  may have  just accused  Will Ferrell  of stealing  the concept  for anchorman  from him  I hope Will  Ferrell gets it  he has to  oh yeah he  totally gets it 
[03:09:30]  he absolutely  gets it  yeah  that's how famous  Will Ferrell is though  like uh  movie line  Colin Quinn tweets  that Will Ferrell  had a bad  drug problem  yeah Will Ferrell's  gotta fucking read that  and just laugh his  ass off like  fucking Colin  yeah you hope  you hope so  I would think so  it's shit  you know what it  is though  it's a  it's brilliant  because it  first of all  it's just funny  on the  on the surface  it's funny shit  to read  but you dig  down deeper 
[03:10:00]  and and  that's pure  Colin is  taking something  like Twitter  and showing  everyone how  ridiculous  it is  and how easy  it is  to take  something  that is  social networking  and twist  things around  and actually  make people  believe anything  and everybody  wants to be  first to print it  so  right  Colin Quinn  is saying  you know  Will Ferrell  is a drug addict  and he stole  Anchorman from me  they're like  fuck we gotta  get this up  on our blog  let's run with it  and they're reporters  but nobody does  any homework  they just get 
[03:10:30]  these tweets  sent to them  they don't  scroll back  they don't care  insane tweets  they're copy  pasters  they're not  reporters anymore  they're copy  pasters  that's exactly  what you just  said Sam  yeah  they don't do  any background  checking at all  they just go  with it  because they need  to be the first  one  un-fucking  believable  oh you know  how you know  the copy and paste  when we mentioned  Patrice  Bob Kelly is the one  who actually said  and it doesn't matter  like Bob Kelly  said it  but they were saying  Jim Norton said  and they were using  Bob Kelly  now I know 
[03:11:00]  some guys  don't know  Bob's voice  so they couldn't  tell the difference  between Bobby and I  and I get that  but when every  when you see  one printed  and then you see  bop bop bop  all these other ones  printed  it was like  all you're doing  is reporting  what they reported  like you're doing  no homework yourself  you're doing  no original work  it's like  fucking lazy man  happens all the  fucking time  they're just lazy  what else do they  have to do  during the day  they're not doing  a radio show  all you have to do  is you know  fact check  like they can't  listen to audio  themselves  first of all  here it's two  different voices 
[03:11:30]  but then just  do their own  homework  and maybe come up  with an angle  themselves  or use their  own words  no  terrible  copy paste  get it up  on the side  boom  move on  exactly it  unbelievable  how gullible  and just  yeah  complete lack  of reporting  well  well  colin said it  and there's  there's no  accountability  which you know  that's the biggest  part  like  does it matter  is somebody  going to get  oh one of these  news agencies  going to get in  trouble  or is the  reporter 
[03:12:00]  going to catch  heat from  whatever superior  they have  because they  printed something  that wasn't  true  or real  or printed it  like it was  true  no  because  everyone accepts  the fact that  if it's written  down  even if it's  on twitter  it must be  true  well the stakes  are too high  so they're all  in on it  stakes  we got any  stakes back  there  stakes are too  high  they're doing  gambling all  the time  just hoping  you know  what they just  read is true  as they put it  on their site  yep  uh  sleeves  has a  colin quinn 
[03:12:30]  song  that's what  coke logic  is telling me  no one  understands  them  hair like  he combed  it with  an m8  jaymore  does his  voice  got skinny  little legs  breakable  cancer fingers  nobody likes  him  he's a dirty  fucking  rosacea  irish face  you can so  break his  fingers  easily  oh god dude  by looking  at them  we gotta hear 
[03:13:00]  the sleeves  colin quinn  song  who wouldn't  want to  the radio  ghost  himself  leaves  radio  ghost  what does that  mean  chase some  fucking  leaves  face down  like see the  last shot  and that is him  just going down  the river  face first  leading the  leaves  by dead  example  you got it  yeah  let's hear it  oh god 
[03:13:30]  here it is  it's buffering  by the way  someone's  fired  is that  really  buffering  i've done  done things  i mean we all  have  am i right  right colin  completely right  terrible thing  that can never  that can never be  taken  that can never be  taken back  colin  ever  it's  ugly stuff

[03:14:30]  but just  you know  what is he doing  what is this  get it  good for you  just lost it  will listen to a lot  of bad drug stars  just lost it  i don't know if he's  serious  actually  i have no idea 
[03:15:00]  what that was  he was reading tweets  i was actually  liking that one  really  by the way colin  tweeted  i guess  at the end  to all media  etc  will ferrell  was not on drugs  at snl  i never even saw  him smoke a joint  is this what it's  come to  with three question  marks  i guess he had to  because it's like  he's kidding  but it's a great way  to end the whole thing  he was getting scared  it exposes everybody  because will would have  fun with that  he was getting scared 
[03:15:30]  he got some pressure  from some people  behind the scenes  i'm assuming  somebody just said  dude you just gotta  say you're joking  it's a great way  to end it  because it's not like  hey i apologize  for this  it's like look  hey idiots  do you even  fucking get this  i want to see  more headlines  sam  i was just reading  some of his other  tweets that didn't  make the article  oh really  right after he tweeted  the lord michaels  thing he tweeted  there's things going  on right now  secret things  behind the scenes  type stuff  that i think  will catapult me  into the best  of the best  and uh 
[03:16:00]  yeah right on  yeah  holy shit  feel bad about  the will ferrell  comments  i'll never mention  him again  if he pays me  my my residuals  for the whole  anchorman concept  he stole  he stole the concept  he wants his residuals  i don't like the fact  that sam read one  that i just read  yes  and did the same  thing i did  with the capital  letters  put emphasis on it  oh the whole  like that  i don't like that  yeah  he repeated what  i said  oh boy 
[03:16:30]  what's going on  with you today  what's going on  oh no  yeah you would be  on beretta's shoulder  he's getting very antsy  sitting there  i see that  you know who  doesn't do that  to him  i see that  mother  i'm sure he'll be  doing antsy's  jokes soon too  oh and gypsies  wait a minute  yeah  you gotta read  the different tweets  sam  you're reading  the same thing  detective  monahan  heard that  ah quince  gee i don't know  she's only five  come on  they look so nice 
[03:17:00]  when they're that  young  i'm the colonel  i don't touch him  i just look at him  look at him  ah shit  that's a big one today  we gotta get Colin on  i didn't have no  someone i saw on twitter  said something  yeah  i just hadn't seen  Kyle's tweets  i wasn't looking at  twitter yesterday  yeah  god damn  yeah it's uh  it was just  it was hilarious  it's the perfect way  to expose twitter  and expose these 
[03:17:30]  fucking idiots  whether it's just uh  another guy tweeting  that's sitting around  and can't fucking  understand sarcasm  or these dumbass  fucking people in the media  there's a panic going on  though man  because a lot of  a lot of people on twitter  are getting the story  before mainstream news  they're getting it out  there first  so now  what do you do  you gotta gamble  but it's also a mixture  of real journalism  well not even real journalism  like mainstream media  and just a blogger  all of a sudden  it becomes the same  fucking thing  but break it down  Colin's tweeting  this crazy shit 
[03:18:00]  what do you do  do you try to call  his people  knowing that everyone  else is reading twitter  and you know someone  is gonna grab it  and go with it  so then you think  to yourself  well Colin  isn't known to be  this crazy  off the cuff  type of guy  he isn't  in the mainstream  so they go  fuck  we have to go  with this  that's what's going on  there  I don't have time  to confirm it  no because someone  else is gonna grab it  someone else is just  gonna run with it anyway  so I might as well  right  what  what is that one  no just when you 
[03:18:30]  google news him  once the articles  about Will Ferrell  stopped  the last twitter  fiasco that he  started about  Gaddafi  he's brilliant  and if you did  a second of research  you would understand  that Colin  is never serious  on twitter  ever  we got Colin  oh good  and we got Bill  Byrne's studio  Colin Quinn  everyone  Colin  hey guys  how's it going  hey buddy  hey Colin  you sound like  you sound like  a beaten man  after yesterday  just chill and 
[03:19:00]  listen to some music  oh  can you know  again  what's he doing  he's listening to  Bieber  he's a believer  you love the Biebs  I'm a believer  what's up guys  Bill you heard  about Colin  he's in deep  trouble today  oh I heard  all about it  it was trending  Colin Quinn  was trending  yesterday  on twitter  yes he was  it's scary  it's scary  how stupid  they are  isn't it  it's ridiculous  it really is 
[03:19:30]  you continually  expose these  idiots  for what they  are  just like  knee jerk  no research  whatsoever  all you would  have to do  is search  Colin Quinn's  twitter  and you'd  realize  he's done  this before  and it's  documented  why take  everything he  says on twitter  as fact  and print it  like oh my god  he's accusing  he means it  because he means  it  did you mean  it  oh okay  my mistake  I started out 
[03:20:00]  the morning  on a positive  note  talking about  the potential  intriguing  employment stuff  going on  with me  and then  I just mentioned  that Will Ferrell  stole Igerman  from me  yeah of course  then of course  I made up  the drug thing  so that becomes  a big thing  the drug thing  and they ran  with it  did you hear  from anybody  because that's  like  yes  that's why  I had to say  hey man  first my manager  was like  hey  I was getting  out of control  but then I was  like nah man  that's what we  always do too 
[03:20:30]  we're like nah man  this is good  we knew  so did you  send out a tweet  that finally said  it was a joke  you fucking retards  yeah but I want to  hear leading up  to that  so then the manager  is going  whoa Colin  and you're like  come on man  this is alright  and then what  happened  first my manager  answers the phone  to his credit  they go  we asked  one site  we asked Colin  Quinn's manager  for a response  and he just laughed  and hung up  is that what  your manager  is doing  laughing and 
[03:21:00]  hanging up  that's what  you want  your manager  to do  that's very  professional  when all hell  is breaking  loose  that's what  you want  from your  manager  he goes  ha ha ha  click  I actually  like that  treat them  like the  idiots  that they  are  don't  dignify  it  with a  response  did Will  call you  or his  manager  because what  happened  where you  finally had  to go  like look  you morons  I was joking  yeah because  I know  Will  and I know  his manager  his manager  is like  hey man  you know  I'm getting  like 50 calls  can you please say something  can you please say something 
[03:21:30]  I am saying something  it was just about the drug  yeah of course  I go what is  I said  tell Will  I'm sorry  he goes  he's on a plane  he doesn't even know  any of this is going on  he's gonna be like  Will  what's your drug problem  you know  you know what you should have said  Kyle  you should have said  will he be mad  that's a good one  is that Chip  of course  well to be  it's hard to tell Chip  from Jim these days  I can't even argue with him  so 
[03:22:00]  so  Will  have you heard from Will  Farrell  at all  no  no  but really  you know  what's he gonna say  you know  well  I don't know  that's just it  thank you man  was my whole thing  you know  so you're still not  you're not letting that  not letting that one go  are you  no I was like  hey I'm Ron Burgundy  I would come in the office  joking around like that  same name and everything  wow  my favorite tweet  was when you said  that like  Lauren was falling apart  and you were calling the shots  calling the shots  yeah  people were tweeting back 
[03:22:30]  at me like  you won't call  and shit  but of course  even in a couple of media things  you know  Colin Quinn claims  that he was  you know  running SNL secretly  you know  yeah  what dummies  they're just stupid  that was the tweet  that got them  that I was calling the shots  over there  but it's amazing  how stupid they are  like they literally just  like we said before  copy and paste  what some other person  has written  or a blogger  and they don't do  any homework  or read the context  in which these tweets  are written  no  did uh  thanks for adding to that  that was your turn 
[03:23:00]  Colin  yeah exactly  that was your turn  that was the set up  I hit the ball  over the net  what  it's hard  when you're at  the studio  yeah it is  you feel like  I feel like  everybody's sitting there  after each silence  going okay  let's get off  this goddamn phone now  no  a few people  have rolled their eyes  but that's about it  really  do you know  Colin could do that  again today  and people will still  just think he's  he's for real  yeah  they're idiots 
[03:23:30]  they do no research  whatsoever  how many uh  how many followers  do you lose  well  at first  I lost  800  at the beginning  but then  I got a couple  more  now I'm back  I'm almost even  to where I started  yesterday  he's like  twitter blackjack  yeah I'm about even  his twitter stats  is like a roller coaster  you're insane  yeah  every time  you're finally over  100,000  but every time  you got close  you decide to blow  it up  and lose  but this is  exactly how  twitter should be used  like anyone 
[03:24:00]  who takes it  seriously  is an asshole  I mean Colin  is mocking  the whole thing  I love it  the best is when  like some guy  like attacks  you know  like some guy  attacks for me  and they start  attacking  poor idiot  that doesn't get it  and like they just  ruined him  like some girl  yesterday  was like  sounds like  somebody's jealous  you know  spreading negativity  makes you look  like a fool  and guys are like  shut up  you dirty hole  yeah they react 
[03:24:30]  to a spitball  with a howitzer  one guy just  writes back  AIDS  AIDS  AIDS  AIDS  AIDS  AIDS  that's probably  one of ours  yeah  probably  I'm being polite  you think so  yeah  I love those people  trying to get  philosophical  and teach you  a life lesson  through a tweet  in 140 characters  you're gonna  get enlightened  you know  as Confucius  always said  shut the fuck  you think Confucius  used the word  the letters  you are 
[03:25:00]  for your  yeah  when he was  trying to write  you well  that was very  funny Jimmy  that was a good one  oh that's it  look at the big  the big book  out there  from Chris Matthews  yeah  scumbag  who wouldn't  come on our show  talking about JFK  it's really  this is why we need  another book  about JFK  because we don't  know every  fucking thing  did you know  he fucked Marilyn  why wouldn't he  come on your show  because he's a  douchebag  that's why  he was booked  and then you know  a dumb excuse  was had 
[03:25:30]  which means he  found out I guess  who we are  or something  yeah his publicist  probably listened  to the show  and was like  oh shit  you don't want to  go on that show  yeah  they'll actually  read your book  and then tell you  what they think of it  and they don't care  about your influence  in this business  it's a look inside  his childhood  gives a shit  a privileged  fucking childhood  what's that  he's from Philly  no he means JFK  oh  I read a book 
[03:26:00]  about it  when I was a little kid  by the way  I know I'm going  to get disconnected  by you are for this  when I was a little kid  because you guys  are going to be signaling  I read a book  about JFK  and it really was  quite an impacting book  it was like  he used to eat toast  he had a fight  he had a piece of toast  and he got on the bus  and he had a fight  with the kid  who turned out  to be his best friend  that's always a nice way  to start things off  humorous anecdote  yeah I wish you were here  yesterday  Chris Matthews  hadn't done an hour  on that  so the toast incident  Chris did you write  about that  go  go  hey you  use toast  as a metaphor 
[03:26:30]  for what JFK was  yeah  like he was wearing  toast on his head  and it got shot off  a bunch of jelly  jelly on it  someone threw butter  from the grassy knoll  well the only  the only uncalled for  thing yesterday  was in the middle  of each Twitter war  and all these media things  was once in a while  somebody would just  trash and go  and by the way  bought a stink  boss never gets  off unscathed  but by the way  this is why  this is why 
[03:27:00]  I told you  you should have  you should have  gone on  Piers Morgan  without warning  that producer  you should have  just on TV  just said  it's a joke  you should have  shamed them  you were too nice  that was for the  other one  I know  but I'm saying  you should have  shamed them  publicly  how about the fact  that I get off  the end train  I had to go  do a  like a thing  oh don't call it  that  oh  I get off  the end train  anyone knows  that's the day  of course  about 1130  at night 
[03:27:30]  I come up  my station  there's a picture  of Bill Burr  on the middle  of the car  I love it  I would have  loved to have  seen that picture  of your face  did you just  look down  at your phone  real quick  and not look  up until  you were on  56  no I just  took my phone  and I made  somebody take  a picture  of my face  over his  I don't think  we could believe  anything Colin  says anymore  no  a confirmed  Twitter liar  nothing but lies  just a phony 
[03:28:00]  baloney  yep  yeah  Mr. Quinn  yeah you better  go back to  tweeting us  something right  yeah  yeah you know  Colin you could  have been  uplifting with  your fame  instead of  spreading all  that negativity  to it  you're right  like one of  the Kardashians  that's why  they have  10 million followers  because they  put in positivity  yeah  what was your  I started the  morning on some  positive notes  I was saying  really good stuff  what was your  favorite headline  you read yesterday  about yourself  I don't know  I didn't really  what is it  Colin Quinn  slams  let's see what  this one says 
[03:28:30]  Colin Quinn tweets  that Will Ferrell  had a bad  drug problem  then they just  go over my  timeline  and they  they even  had my  early date  like in the  early part of  the day  yeah  I was tweeting  like feeling a lot  of good things  going on in the  world right now  for me  a lot of  positivity  and they  tweet those  too  I don't even  explain like  why  why you said  that  exactly  like  a bunch of  idiots  can they look at  you and realize  you couldn't  feel good  no they know  he's joking around  they're just  taking it seriously  so all the  they're pandering 
[03:29:00]  to the morons  something to talk  about  yeah  yeah  exactly  you think that  plays into it too  they don't care  if it's right  then when I'm  walking in Walmart  someday after a  crummy gig in the  road some old  lady's gonna throw  something at me  you leave Will Ferrell  alone  I just love that  he just said  crummy  like he was on  leave it to be  crummy  gee  gee  beave  that's crummy  that guy's a  creep or something  yeah they're all  sticks in the mud  call  don't be such a  wet end  what's a wet end  what's a wet end  it's just like a

[03:32:30]  I took six years  of Spanish  mi pistolero es  oh really  I don't know  it's incorrect  mi nombré es  mi nombré es  which is this  Chilean show  where these guys  Chilean  Chilean  they're saying  someone said  Chilean  is it cold in there  did I say Chilean  yeah  ah fuck  Chilean  oh I'm sorry  Chilean  Chile  Chile  yeah they did  a follow up story  on this guy  I guess  yeah this guy  sounds just like  Eddie Vedder  and we made 
[03:33:00]  the what  Chilean  Chilean  the Chile  the Chile news  the news from Chile  the Chile news  we made the  news  and they used  some audio  from our show  well yeah  because the story  was about  Chris Cornell  recognizing the  talents of this  singer  and they used  the YouTube  footage that  the Sirius XM  team had uploaded  of our show  right on  let's hear it  thanks to 
[03:33:30]  Chris Cornell  one of the  most famous  Chris Cornell  saw the  presentation  of Javier  when in a  radio program  in the United States  radio  satellite radio  oh my god  that's pretty  I swear  I thought  they were  and if  I'm listening  and getting  ready to judge  it  yeah  yeah  it'll be worth  doing  at an actual  pro-time show  just for a minute  and just 
[03:34:00]  see everybody  look  and see  and now they're  talking to the  guy  he can't believe  he's like  oh my god  is that what he  said  do you know  Spanish Sam  un poco  then tell us  what the fuck  this guy's saying  he's smiling  so he enjoyed  the fact that  Chris Cornell  is digging him  he's speaking  Chilean  so there's  some differences  but  different dialect  that you don't  quite get  yeah  it's like Klingon 
[03:34:30]  at the geek  fests that you  go to  where the fuck  is Mars  we finally need  him  he doesn't know  how to speak  Spanish  get that dirty  you know what  in here  what do you mean  he doesn't know  he doesn't know  anything about  Spanish  like damn  that's a good  language  damn  he talks  good  he don't  know Spanish  no he doesn't  know Spanish  he knows Spanish  worse than he  knows English  he can't speak  English  you don't know  Spanish  he doesn't  really know  Spanish  well  he has no  idea what  he's talking  about  sort of  Rican  damn  he's a good  liar  oh shit  well translate 
[03:35:00]  this shit  for us  go back  to the  Chris Cornell  right after  the Chris Cornell  I bet he has  no idea  he's gonna  make it up  right there  it's good  we had subtitles  you know how  I'm gonna  do what they  do on TV  I'm gonna  turn down  the audio  a little bit  so the Spanish  is in the  background  and you're  gonna translate  as best  you can  alright here  we go  get ready  he says 
[03:35:30]  no  that's not  how it works  you ever see  a translator  like the UN  or something  or on TV  they have  the guy  giving the  speech  and at the  same time  the translator  is talking  yeah  with the  underlying  speech  going on  underneath  yeah  that's  going  nowhere  right now  that's  not  gonna  happen  no  he says  it never  crossed his  mind  or imagined  that it  could have  gone up  to that  level  damn 
[03:36:00]  that's  a good  translation  alright  let's  continue  so far  so good  fucking  Sam  sorprendió  al líder  de  SunGarden  y hasta  el día  de hoy  es  una  revolución  en las  redes  sociales  este  fue  el primer  grupo  que se  creó  en  facebook  para  apoyarlo  y en  una  semana  tenía  7000  seguidores  if you  don't  have  the  word  sound  garden  in  your  translation  you're  fired  it's 
[03:36:30]  the only  word  I  recognize  she  said  a lot  can you  go back  just a little  no  she  don't  want  to spend  all  day  on  basically  what  she  saying  is  summarize  7000  followers  there  go  okay  good  leader  the  sunGarden  so this is the first time that they use soundgarden and it it became a social a social event where there was the first group that used facebook to reach out to the people 
[03:37:00]  it was a revolutionary  yeah he didn't get that right at all  i mean that didn't even make sense what she said  first time they used soundgarden  they didn't use  facebook  you said sound  you said this is the first time they've used soundgarden used facebook to reach people  this is the first time soundgarden's ever been on facebook  what  what are you doing  that translation is completely wrong  it's horrible  what are you saying  this is either the worst news network ever 
[03:37:30]  or the translation is completely wrong  maybe this is some dumb college news station then  he's saying soundgarden is leading the facebook revolution  wait what  alright go back  go back  we do have  we do have someone on line 3 though  that uh  yeah  says that they can translate  because that idiot doesn't know any of it  give him another chance  if soundgarden be the first something  she speaks fast  whatever  she speaks fast  damn  she's a good speaker  alright go ahead  stop  his voice surprised the leader of soundgarden 
[03:38:00]  that's not at all what you said before  yeah i know  this is the first group  that used facebook  to be supported  and in the first week  i think  she pointed  sourgaard wasn't the first  what she's saying  is this is what she said  she said this is the first facebook group for him 
[03:38:30]  and in a week had 7,000 followers  okay so so this is his facebook  his facebook  has nothing to do with soundgarden  no  facebook page for him  that is the first group  that was made to support  alright  hold on we got  we got soundgarden  we got  gee  is it gee or gee  it's gee  gee what's up gee  yeah yeah  um  i think soundgarden  right  that's good  samgarden  and marge is like  no that's  you said soundgarden  was revolutionizing facebook  or something  right 
[03:39:00]  you're talking to that puerto rican dummy  oh  wow  you're gonna take that mars  that's not nice  damn that's a good insult  alright  gee  stay on the line  and sam shut up  cause you obviously know more spanish  than you're leading on to  you just wanted to set mars up  actually  you could pretty much  and you know why  he can't speak english  you know why  why baby boy sam knows spanish  why  mother  not mother  he was raised by a nanny  i had a spanish housekeeper  oh  he's a rich little kid  he is a rich little spoiled brat 
[03:39:30]  who should be down at that stupid park  listen  but his dad has decided not to  you know  move the money to sam  sam's gotta do it on his own  not yet  you inherit it  so you know spanish  i see  he didn't want to leave on  i think if you could make out  two or three words  in these sentences  you know the context  of the conversation  and that's what kind of  makes it easier  to figure out by yourself  unless you don't speak the language  i could never speak like that  or anything  right  all right  put it this way 
[03:40:00]  if that was just audio  and you knew nothing  of this story  yeah  you would not know  what the fuck she said at all  right  but since you know the story  you're seeing video  you're seeing the  you know  the image of facebook  and this guy  you could kind of figure it out  but mars picked up on  all the wrong keywords  and just pieced the story  entirely wrong  didn't mars basically say  soundgarden was revolutionizing  facebook or something  this is the first time  soundgarden has been  on facebook  no it's a big event  that used facebook  all right let's try  that's a good social network 
[03:40:30]  in sight  all right let's try some more  we got g on the line  to help us out  and obviously sam  who speaks it fluently  okay go ahead  okay that's one of his favorite groups  and that's why they're supporting  that group  and what they're going for  gee  oh my god  what did he just say  mars what did you say  that that's one of his favorite groups  well that's a different guy talking 
[03:41:00]  so i don't know what that  yeah  okay  who said that  okay this is a different person  that they're talking to now  not the guy who sang  not the guy that sounds like Eddie better  right  okay  this is eduardo contardo  and he i believe put together  the facebook page  for javier diaz  yeah  because i'm seeing  like i could just figure it out  just by looking at the  where the words are  but that's what he is  mar said watch  right  mar 
[03:41:30]  he said mar said  this is one of his favorite groups  so he made a group  to support that group  group group  but he group group  groupie group group group  group group  gee what do you get out of that  um  what sam said  because  i i can't  i can't tell who's talking  but anyway  um  should we go back one more time  all right listen  yeah  listen closely  and let mars have  mars has the first shot  and then g  all right  and sam who uh  obviously speaks fluent 
[03:42:00]  oh yeah  shut the fuck up  all right hit it  7000 seguidores  bueno  perjame  es  uno de mis grupos  favoritos  por eso cree  la  creese  esa página  digamos  en apoyo a javier  pearl jam is one of his favorite groups  that's why he made that page  no he likes  i even know  the page is made for the guy that imitates  pearl jam  the guy made the facebook page for that guy who sounds like eddie vetter  but he's a fan of that guy not pearl jam 
[03:42:30]  gee help me out  gee is that what happened  he said  that  it is one of his favorite groups  and that he made the facebook page  uh for javier  because it was  a machine  oh  so  he had to  i figure  here's what  he did it to  support him  support javier  the last part of the sentence  was hard to figure out  yeah  and so mars just heard the first part  about pearl jam  and he created  group groupity groupity group  and then he just made up the rest 
[03:43:00]  group group group group  i'm trying to make it easy for you guys  oh yeah  oh are you mars  yes  because you notice in mars description  of what that guy said  javier was not mentioned once  and the word machine  wasn't even brought up  oh  all right  he didn't say javier  let's go back  did he say javier  we know it's about javier  but i'm just  he said javier  oh look at the chick that's bashing you  by the way  is she fine  it's her on the phone right there  let me see  oh wow  look at the camera  hold on  hold on  oh yeah  you've been on our show before  i love tech now  yes i have

[03:44:00]  and you gotta order some  do you think mars can pass  the spanish regents test  i don't think so  all right let's go  i think speedy gonzalez is in trouble now  all right here we go  wait wait wait wait  to support javier  that was the end  that was where mars just insisted  that that guy never said javier  well i said support him  and the last word was javier  okay  okay  back to the guy  that sounds like getting better  another guy  we're in a bodega 
[03:44:30]  that's a great way  crees esa página  digamos en apoyo a javier  precisamente la derrota de marzo  lo llevó a tomar  una gran decisión  all right  okay um  the dethroning of marzo  whoever marzo is  all of a sudden  that word is thrown in there  yeah  yeah  yeah  what's marzo  words aren't all of a sudden  thrown in there  who's marzo though  it's maz  maz  that's  all right  go back a little bit more  this is the beginning of the clip 
[03:45:00]  okay  okay  precisamente la derrota de marzo  lo llevó a tomar  una gran decisión  all right  you're sweating man  because of the dethroning of marzo  that's why he made the decision  to go ahead and do this  i think  she said he's gonna have  a big decision  he made a big decision  he made a big decision  all right  uh g  um  oh my god  i can't believe he's  who's marzo  marzo is march  idiot  oh shit 
[03:45:30]  wait a month  you don't even know  how to say  you don't even know  how to say the months  in spanish  she just threw that word  and i don't know  damn  that's a good translation  um  he um  he went  sorry  bankrupt  in march  and that  that was one of  the reasons why  he made that big decision  he had to make  oh  he went bankrupt  make the decision  to go on the show  yeah  okay so that's not at all 
[03:46:00]  what marzo  and what did marzo  say again  marzo said  who's marzo  marzo  that because of  dethroning marzo  he's made a decision  i told you  marzo doesn't know  spanish or english  oh you gotta be banned  i got  send someone  to black island  marzo  marzo  i'm puerto rican too  so i'm allowed  to bash you  okay  everyone is saying  marzo is march  all right 
[03:46:30]  we're almost done  we made the news  down there in chile  apparently  i guess  yeah  lo llevó a tomar  una gran decisión  quiero volver a  a mi nombre  por la rancha  con ganas  wait a second  you want me to continue  no uh  or to go back  go back  oh boy  oh jeez  he's in trouble  oh boy  tell me when to stop  okay  decisión  quiero volver a  a mi nombre  por la rancha  he wants to return  to the name  for the 
[03:47:00]  for the ranch  he wants to return  to his name  for the ranch  whatever the fuck  the ranch is  wait wait  maybe he wants  to go back  on mi nombre  es  i think  i  he  let me  he went  let me listen  let me  because marzo  oh boy  lo llevó a tomar  una gran  decisión  quiero volver  a mi nombre  por la rancha  go  all right  what is it  what is it  marzo  i want to return  to my name  for the  for the  ranch  for the  ranch  for the  ranch  ranch  ranch 
[03:47:30]  ranch  oh  i thought he  needed a  wrench for  something  damn  that's a good  tool  why would you  say wrench  if you don't know  what he's saying  he wants to return  to his name  for the  ranch  for the  ranch  i don't  understand  i don't know  what  ranch was  i think  he's saying  something about  like he wants  to to  regain his  name  i don't know  without the  full context  of the sentence  so maybe he  wants to go  back on the  show and  regain his  name or  regain his  title  g what do 
[03:48:00]  you got on  that  he wants  to go  back on  mi nombre  es  to  oh  of course  yes  the name  of the  show  i got that  too  i messed up  on that  you're doing  it badly  you said  wrench  did he  lose  like his  ranch  or something  he must  he must  have lost  his ranch  in the  bankruptcy  that's context  but morris  said wrench  no i did  not say  wrench  you said  wrench  that he  wants his  wrench back  i didn't mean  no wrench  man  you said 
[03:48:30]  wrench  you would  never say  wrench  if you meant  ranch  so g said  he wants  to go  back on  mi nombre  es  so he  can get  his ranch  back  morris  said he  wants to  return to  his name  so he  can get  the wrench  mars is  like a  little kid  in spanish  class  who just  literally  translates  each word  instead of  recontexting  the sentence  right  well he wants  to get his  name back  so he  can get  his wrench  back  his wrench  because he  needs  he needs  his name  i am  in the  bibliotheca 
[03:49:00]  you are  a  morris  that's  unkind  we're almost  done  comments  coming in  that people  want to  hit mars  with a  wrench  with el  wrencho  el wrencho  el wrencho  let's go  mars  you can do  this  with the  desire to  go on  and  achieve his  goals  and 
[03:49:30]  the last  part  i didn't  catch  by the way  a lot of  people say  after his  defeat in  march  he wants  to return  to the  show  i guess  someone  finally  defeated  him  on the  show  he  with desire 
[03:50:00]  to continue  going  and  progressing  um  doing  doing  celebrity  imitations  yeah  i would  just go  to g  on this  right  he's gonna  he's gonna  achieve  great  things  oh yeah  he has  the desire  to  go on  and  um  i  marked  that  when you  got  right  thank  you  yeah  but  sam  shut 
[03:50:30]  up  yes  sam  how did  you help  them there  you think  i listened  to this  you saw  that  oh damn  you don't  listen to him  he derails me  all the time  you think  i fucking  listen to him  are you kidding  me  look how proud  he is  but i think  sam helped  him  you can't  help yourself  don't help  this guy  you're right  can i control  the mouse  no  what  what would  that matter  it'll matter  a lot  damn  that's a good  mouse  i want it  as a pet  sorry 
[03:51:00]  i know  mother's  not gonna  be happy  with me  she'll  be alright  with that  i think  you were  helping  him  though  don't  help  him  do you  say  raton  for  computer  mouse  in  spanish  no  i don't  know  hey  i need  a new  optical  rat  he can't  even relate  to his  fellow  Puerto Rican  she's like  no  this is the  most insane  thing because  the whole thing 
[03:51:30]  has been that  mars can't  pronounce anything  in english  and the  assumption  has been  that's because  of a language  barrier  because it's  his second  language  he was born  in america  and he can't  speak spanish  either  why would you  look that way  if you can't  speak spanish  he has that  Puerto Rican  spanish  that's gonna suck  you look that way  and you can't  speak the language  either language  look what way  you know  you look kinda  hispanic  i don't understand 
[03:52:00]  what you mean  by that  i think he's  talking about  like those  people  those people  if you look  that way  you should be  able to speak  spanish  oh man  i really look  i really look  Puerto Rican  brown skinned  not really  not really  right  you could be  a few things  like  you could  i don't know  you could  you could almost  pass for an  italian  yeah  i've heard that  and  middle eastern  irish  italian or irish  if you drew  your hair out  you could look 
[03:52:30]  like kadhafi  i told you  that this morning  a little  middle eastern  i did tell you  that right  north african  that was a  compliment  right  compliment  kadhafi  is not a  handsome man  just don't  say he looks  dominican  that's really  a thing  we know that  PR taught us  that years ago  puerto ricans  and dominicans  don't really  get along  well  that's for sure  and you don't  want to be called  mexican either  right  no  we're not  see i know  that too  marcy  i'm with you  my brother  are you ready  for the rest  of this  how much more  we got  40 seconds  i don't understand 
[03:53:00]  that  we already did  that  we already did  that one  remember  you already  you already  translated that  incorrectly  you already  translated that  again  i don't even  remember  okay  wow  she said  she said  a certain number  of subscribers  but i didn't get  that number  all right  um  all right  i'm gonna play  it again  okay  gee you listening 
[03:53:30]  yeah play it  again  okay  we're playing  it again  did he say  8000  i don't know  8000  it's 8000  or 80,000  no no  8000  but i didn't hear  8000  i heard octo  i heard octo  everyone heard  octo  i heard octo  he's even got  puerto  rican ears  oh  all right  mars  what does  it say  that they 
[03:54:00]  got um  8000  subscribers  and i got  stuck on  that  you came  down the  hall  you came  down the  hall  all confident  like damn  they finally  need me  for something  no  i can  watch what  i do  now  they finally  need me  i came down  the hall  because the  boss  called me  in  you're supposed  to be the  minority  influence  on the  show  that's  true  the show  needs that  all right  gee what  what was  said there  said that 
[03:54:30]  the um  the show  has 8000  contestants  oh  of course  wait  didn't you say  contestants  you said  subscribers  right  1,000  subscribers  even like  anthony was  saying  like  even you  could figure  out  contestants  because  what were  they showing  on the  television  contestants  so why  are they  talking about  subscribers  so if there  was a number  and you see  a lot of  people  i would  probably  assume  8,000  people  are trying  out  for the  show  context  has a lot  to do  with it  yeah  all right  let's  continue  okay  okay 
[03:55:00]  stop  he says  since the  in the beginning  it's more  than um  than a  uh  a theme  of  a voice  theme  it's a  theme  of  attitude  this is  again  he's doing 
[03:55:30]  these literal  like  word for  word  can't you  take those  words  and put it  into a  concept  we can't  see the  forest for  the trees  yes  that's what  you're doing  you're taking  the trees  instead of  looking at  the entire  forest  what's your  spanish  background  you spoke  in your  whole life  yeah  growing up  i came in  here without  listening to  what was  do you have  relatives that  only speak  spanish  are you one  of those  guys  yes  there are 
[03:56:00]  some of  them  but can't  you take  so you  really should  know this  language  can't you  take the  words that  you just  said  even in  english  and just  move them  around so  you can get  it in the  context of a  sentence that  somebody would  actually say  on television  i'm just  i'm just  uh  what did he  say again  i don't know  let me  no what did  marce say  he said  he said  uh  that the  show  has  not so  much  a singing  theme  and more  attitude  theme  something like  are you  sticking with  that  i'm sticking  with that  all right  g  he said 
[03:56:30]  that it  wasn't just  about the  voice and  just to  it wasn't  just about the  voice and  imitating it  was just also  attitude  now can't you  like  so did marce  sort of get  that  no he  didn't  because he  took the  words and  literally  translated them  instead of  doing what  g did  and processing  them with an  intelligent brain  and coming out  with a sentence  okay  uh oh  marce is giving 
[03:57:00]  me the up and  down i think  we're gonna have  a new movie  trailer after  this  no no  he's intimidating  me a little bit  yeah he doesn't  like this  no he doesn't  like this at  all he might  pull out one  of his knives  yeah  which one  this one  certainly carry  see  he's got  one  only he can  say it  in spanish  fuck that  damn that's a  good knife  man  you see that  knife he's got  well it's for  engineering work  yeah  yeah  wire stripper  and stuff  we have to see 
[03:57:30]  what's going to happen  with this second  season  with this  uh  rhetorical  i think  rhetorical  and vengeance  rhetorical  and vengeance  those are the words  that i think  rhetorical  what  rhetorical  and vengeance  okay  so  vengeance  i think  venganza  so what sam  saying  uh  say what  does he  say  he is  saying  uh  we have  to see  what's  going to  happen  with this  second  season  with the  rhetorical  and vengeance  is that  correct  why you  throw your  hands on  your hips  like that  because that's  how i 
[03:58:00]  stand  uh  hold on  hold on  uh  tommy's got  something  tommy go  ahead  hey you know  what you guys  should do  just to show  how much  of a  douchebag  mars is  any english  quotes off  of youtube  like any  clip  and have  him see  if he  can translate  that  uh  g what  was said  there  um  the second  season  that's not  what he  said  he said  the second  go around 
[03:58:30]  basically  okay  the second  go around  that he'll  do it  with even  more  vengeance  vengeance  mars  you might  have got  that one  right  no no no  no  because he  also added  in  what was  the word  rhetorical  that  yeah that  doesn't even  make any  sense  vengeance  rhetorical  is like  when you  ask a  question  don't  expect  an  answer  that's  why i  said i  wasn't sure  of that  word  but if  he says  something  like that  we're  almost  done  let's  get  to the end  of this  i wish 
[03:59:00]  mars did a  broadcast  in his  broken  spanish  and just  threw in  words like  rhetorical  out of  nowhere  can you  do a  can you  do an  hour of  radio in  spanish  i can't  i've done  it before  where in  the army  really  yeah  what  sam  for salsa  i mean  but you  can't really  but it's  spanglish  that's my  savior  it's spanglish  spanglish  spanglish  do you want  to listen to  mars try  to do an  hour  we might 
[03:59:30]  have to  think about  that one  mars does  an hour of  radio in  spanish  in spanglish  no no no  spaninglish  oh he did  say spaninglish  spaninglish  can't even  say spanglish  right  spaninglish  you're right  alright let's  go  oh shit  one of the  methods of 
[04:00:00]  go back  i understand  she says a lot  i'm obsessed  with this  for one reason  he said he  grew up with  the language  and he has  relatives that  don't speak  english so he  has to communicate  with them  you don't have to  translate this part  i know  then i have to  think about what  he's saying  don't think about  what this guy says  just let it play  sam do you know  what he's saying  don't say  don't say  but it's not  about you  i don't look at you 
[04:00:30]  and think you know  spanish  i shouldn't  exactly  don't think about this  mars  una de sus metas  ser el ganador  de la segunda temporada  de mi nombre es  que parte  el 6 de octubre  y donde el verdadero talento  es  saber  imitar  see he's not  stopping  i'm trying to  it's one form  even we know that  she's fucking  throwing a lot of  information  she's throwing  the information  the date of the  damn that's a lot  of information  one of the methods 
[04:01:00]  of the uh of this  individual in the  second moment  javier we know his  name uh which is  going to air on the  date that she said  october 6th  yeah all that stuff  and remember  that's where we're at  that's it  oh my god  one of the methods  october 6th  well we stopped it  we stopped  no we stopped at the end  of the sad tense  okay what's the  method that she said  wait so you didn't  know the date  wait what'd he say  he said okay  then what's the  method that she's  talking about  all right this is  what i want you to  do sam one more  time i helped him 
[04:01:30]  with the date i did  it again i should  yeah yeah i'm a  helpful that's  because you're  trying to show off  you're right you're  right to yell  you're showing off  because you don't  like being yelled at  no you should have  yelled at me i think  i was writing and  yelling at you  you were instant  go back one more  time this last part  and let the whole  clip finish because i  think it's over at  that point anyway i  think they just go to  music or something  so what's the method  let's get ready no  pen no no pen  look at this  mars mars  oh shit it's like  code you can't write  it why not why  because the boss said  so right because you 
[04:02:00]  grew up you grew up  with spanish you  shouldn't have to  write it there's two  there are two  can i write i don't  think writing is good  okay i think it's  cheating oh for two  here we go all right  to the end sam you  got it  una de sus metas ser el  ganador de la segunda  temporada de mi nombre es  que parte el seis de  octubre y donde el  verdadero talento es saber  imitar  is that the end of the 
[04:02:30]  clip yeah and then he  just sings out okay i  believe one of the  methods that he's going to  use in the second go  around on october the  sixth is to be uh to  imitate to imitate greatly  or accurately  why did i say that  so what did he say i can't 
[04:03:00]  focus enough to hear what  mars is saying said one of  the methods that he will  use on the second go  around on october six is  accurately imitating  celebrities  that's what accurately  imitating  what the hell  number one it's not a  complete it's not it  doesn't make any sense  and number two even  even if that the thought 
[04:03:30]  behind what that said  that's not like a a  thought that anybody i  don't think you can put  a period at the end of  that spanish sentence and  like even if it was like  they're making the point  that hit what he will do  in the second season is  accurately imitate somebody  yeah like why would you  say that about a show  that's only about  imitating celebrities like  nobody would make that  point  nobody would say that's  like saying one of the  things he's going to do  this season on american  idol is try to sing well  that's what the show is  right  all right gee  that she's saying what she 
[04:04:00]  said and what she's saying  about javier is that his  ultimate goal is to win  and i guess they are on  their second season yeah  and uh you know the that  that's his ultimate goal is  to win  that was the key to the  sentence was ganador mars you  sort of like have some of  the words but then you can't  like figure it out in your  head this is the key words he  didn't right win winner win  she never said method 
[04:04:30]  she's a kind of door  can you please yes i will  if someone wants me to break  down the wall i already told  you uh when are you going to  break down the wall i hope is  sam really going to bring 10  minutes of a foreign language  in with no prep he translated  all beforehand no sam grew up  with a fucking spanish nanny i  had a spanish housekeeper that  lived in my housekeeper god a  live-in housekeeper until i was  like snob 10 yes no who was  the living housekeeper in my 
[04:05:00]  house oh me and my four  brothers and my two fucking  sisters so you don't know  spanish time to do chores  motherfucker i didn't have  that many stories that's what  i want to ask mars a question  yes oh mars yes ma'am could  you could you ask it in  spanish please  si por favor en español  en español  that's good  tus padres no te ayudaron  aprender español  si  no te enseñaron a leer y 
[04:05:30]  escribir en español  no leer y escribir lo hice en  la escuela  wow  yeah  you know my mother used to  make me sit and watch  spanish television  read no wait  she asked for those that  think i for those that think  that i translated this ahead of  time she asked him first  didn't your parents help you  learn spanish when you were a  kid and he said yes they did  yes and then she said didn't  they help you read and write in 
[04:06:00]  spanish and he said no i learned  that in school  although this whole thing is scripted as we do on the opie and anthony show  it's one of our bits that we do  which proves the slums have bad schooling  and that's why i said my mother used to speak spanish harlem has horrible schools  spanish harlem has horrible schools  spanish harlem  i assume that's where you were brought up  spanish harlem  the thing is i grew up i was born and raised in new york too  so what's you know i just don't understand what's the excuse 
[04:06:30]  there really isn't so you got terrible terrible terrible parents  this is nature versus nurture mars  that's right parents should have taught you how to read and write and stuff  there is no excuse i you know  soy estupido  i know that one  so you know as much spanish as i do  and i took six years in school  probably  it's pretty good  yeah it's pretty good  i admire you  damn that's a good amount of spanish 
[04:07:00]  i barely passed  so did maris  last year the whole class was in spanish  i was lost  maris was  he took spanish in school  because he thought he would get the good grade  but he was like the weirdo in spanish class  he was just failing  what are you doing  he probably went  damn this is going to be an easy class  he got the paper and said  damn that's a hard question  damn 
[04:07:30]  damn i'm failing  damn that's a bad grade  probably the whitest  you probably had white fucking kids doing better than you in spanish class  you know what's great about this  what  you guys assume that my spanish was that great  i've never said that  but you can't speak english  oh shit  but you were brought up with the language  yeah but you know i'm a new york reacon  well she says  how am i  but you know what  how am i  you know what 
[04:08:00]  we broke away from that shit in the household  you spend more time out  you know  outside with the white folks  and you want to talk with the white folks  yeah  you know forget that spanish  right  all right  but you have that horrible accent too  oh man  oh  she doesn't like you man  that's cool because i don't like puerto rican women either  wait what don't  never  why don't you like  puerto rican women  there's a lot of reasons  you got a list 
[04:08:30]  all right  do you talk about your civilian  because that's one rule in the show  if you don't want to talk about your  mucho cunto  thank you  best one  what's your wife  white  in what way  in every way  in the right  there's a lot of different whites out there  like what is her background  what do you mean  um norwegian and german  damn  that's right  damn  that's a lot of white  her parents were born here  it's great  we're talking about grandparents  and you  i just assumed that you were married to a puerto rican 
[04:09:00]  of course because you assume a lot  oh  oh  damn  damn  he's stereotyping man  damn  that's a racist host  you also assumed that  yeah  what happened now  that i took you all to let yesterday  first thing in the morning  yo where's my wallet  see  you're a little insecure  that was a joke  oh okay  it was missing though  my wallet was missing  of course i'm gonna blame the puerto rican  that's the joke 
[04:09:30]  me and travis didn't take it  yeah i didn't take it  i didn't think you actually took it mar  seriously  no  okay  so why wouldn't you marry a puerto rican girl  uh  mainly  for the same reason a puerto rican woman  won't marry a freaking  puerto rican man  so you guys  okay what's that reason g  it's for the same reason  okay what is it  you don't like puerto rican  men  uh  women  what is the reason though  what is it  i just don't  you know what  that's one thing we have in common  all right
