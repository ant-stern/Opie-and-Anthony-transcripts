<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a whimsical discussion about the modern-day appearances of deceased rock icons Jim Morrison, John Lennon, and James Dean, swiftly transitioning to a heated debate about the ongoing impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.  The hosts then dove headfirst into their "Tuesday Night Hummer Club" segment, fielding calls from listeners seeking assistance in obtaining oral sex from their partners.  Numerous calls detailed varying levels of success, with one caller boasting two "Hummers" in a single day and another achieving membership while in Aruba.  A significant portion of the segment involved a heated disagreement between Opie and Anthony regarding a controversial three-month membership renewal policy for the Hummer Club, with Anthony accusing Opie of initiating the rule and claiming to possess an incriminating audio tape as proof.

A commercial break featured an advertisement for "Cigars Around the World," showcasing their subscription service and various cigar brands. Opie quipped about naming his humidor "Monica," referencing the ongoing Clinton scandal.  The hosts then shared a possibly recycled joke, followed by the announcement of a contest winner, Mike Moran, who won a Joe Perry guitar lesson and a Gibson guitar.  Upcoming prizes, including family four-packs to see Roger Daltrey's production of "A Christmas Carol," were announced, sparking a discussion about Daltrey's past work, including "Tommy" and "Quadrophenia," and mentioning the involvement of Billy Idol and Gary Glitter.  Brief background banter with a female staff member, Carol, was also included.

A listener then called in proposing a "Hummer Points" system to incentivize household chores, assigning points for tasks like washing dishes and vacuuming, redeemable for sexual intercourse.  Opie and Anthony debated the merits and implications of this system, touching upon the topic of bribery within relationships.  The show concluded with a return to the ongoing dispute between the hosts regarding the Hummer Club's membership policy and the aforementioned audio tape, which Anthony teasingly refused to play, promising its revelation at a later date.  The segment ended with further Hummer Club banter and a preview of the next day's guest, "Pork Man."  Interspersed throughout the broadcast were segments dedicated to reminiscing about early MTV music videos, criticizing Puff Daddy/P. Diddy's music, and their recurring "Furby Police" bit, which involved calling someone selling overpriced Furbies.  A call to a listener whose wife was unresponsive sexually resulted in the wife hanging up on the hosts.  The show also included a promotion for "Take Paws," realistic stuffed animals.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts used vulgar language and made sexually suggestive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, cheap trick, dream police and surrender.  The doors before that, backdoor man and L.A. woman, Jim Morrison would have been 55 years old today.  Yeah, right. That would have never happened.  You know, there's all those rumors that maybe he didn't die back in, what year was that again? I forget, 71 or whatever it was.  Well, he's a guy, you know, that died at a very young age, Opie. 
[00:00:30]  And except for that real fat bearded phase, you remember him as being like the cool rock dude, you know.  Yeah.  You just can't get into that fat bearded phase.  No.  But now he would have been pretty old.  He would have been a mess.  Yeah.  So let's say he tricked everyone and he didn't die in 71.  He would have never made it to 1980.  No, I doubt it.  So.  Yeah.  John Lennon's another one.  Yeah.  I remember him as being John Lennon walking around New York. 
[00:01:00]  Right.  How old would he have been?  You know?  55 or so, 56?  He's older, probably.  Older?  I would think.  Well, I'm sure we'll get 8 billion phone calls to exact age, but.  Yeah.  You know.  And before you abuse me, I'm a huge Doors fan.  You know?  Why are you messing with Jim, man?  Says something for dying young, though.  Yeah, doesn't it?  Seriously.  Think of James Dean, Anthony.  Yeah.  James Dean.  What was James Dean all about?  Well, you think of him with the, you know, the Hollywood scene. 
[00:01:30]  He's the young guy.  Movies, fast cars, women.  He was like the Brad Pitt of the 50s.  Right.  He had it all, right?  Yeah.  Now, that's the picture you have in your mind when someone says James Dean.  Because he died young, left a young corpse.  Right.  If James Dean was alive today, who would he look like?  Who?  Marlon Brando.  Yeah, because they were used similar back then, you know.  All right.  What about Marilyn Monroe?  You always think the same thing.  The skirt blown up, the dress, you know, giggling, happy birthday, Mr. President, blonde bombshell. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  Now, if she was alive today.  Yeah.  Joan Rivers.  Oof.  Or even worse, Phyllis Diller.  Shelly Winters.  Shelly Winters.  All right.  Now, if Jim Morrison was alive today.  Who would he look like?  I'm trying to think.  Someone with a beard.  Yeah.  He'd have the big beard.  Probably be very fat.  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  I can't think of anyone.  Santa Claus. 
[00:02:30]  No.  No.  All right.  Well.  Well, I want to welcome everyone to Two for Tuesday.  Yeah.  And we are initiating new members to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club as we speak.  Yes, it is now 20 minutes in to our Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  And Opie.  Uh-huh.  Grand Poobah Opie.  That's right.  It's been a lot of controversy as to who the Poobah is.  And every Tuesday, it seems to go back and forth. 
[00:03:00]  You weren't the Poobah because you hadn't received your Hummer.  I stepped into Poobah.  Right.  I got in trouble.  Was it last week already?  Yeah, last week.  Last week, by declaring that there would be a three-month expiration period on a Hummer Club.  Yes.  Where then you would have to re-up after three months.  Yeah.  It was totally misconstrued to think that I said only get Hummers every three months.  Right.  Isn't what I meant.  Right.  Regardless of that, you jumped on it and said, this is the Poobah you want, people. 
[00:03:30]  Someone who would say three months, every three months you re-upped.  Why, I would say every week.  Right?  And the guys all rallied behind.  Opie, yeah, long live Opie as Poobah.  Throw Anthony out.  Right.  Which, after you received your Hummer last week, made me the Grand Poobah.  You became Poobah.  Because that was the rule you made.  That you would be the Poobah until I became a member of the club.  And I finally became a member last Tuesday.  And you threw me out.  Yeah.  For a couple of weeks. 
[00:04:00]  And suspended you for two weeks.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, Opie, I seem to have found the tape from last week.  Two weeks ago, wasn't it?  Whatever.  Was it last week?  Whatever.  Whatever.  What tape you got?  A tape that proves that you initiated the three-month membership.  Well, I don't see this so-called tape in front of me, Anthony.  I got it.  You're right.  Mm-hmm.  Good luck.  You'll hear it.  Good luck playing it on the air.  Tune in, people, because you will see what kind of a phony your Poobah is. 
[00:04:30]  Good luck.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Yeah, well, I do.  And I have it.  I listened on the way in and said, Opie's the one that came up with the three-month.  Period.  Period.  And he used it totally against me.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I admit I was wrong for then legislating it.  But you were the one that came up with the idea.  All right, well, you'll have to play your little tape later, I guess.  All right, I will.  All right, we'll see what happens.  Yes.  Okay, fax line, 212-957-WNEW.  Phones are going nuts.  I'm sure everyone has a comment about our Jim Morrison and John Lennon comments, so we'll 
[00:05:00]  go to those next.  Hi, NEW.  Yo, you guys are awesome.  Last Tuesday, I got two Hummers from two different girls.  Wow.  I was driving one home from school, and we've been seeing each other for a couple months  now, and we listened to Opie and Anthony, and I got initiated that day.  And then that night, I went out with somebody else, and it was about 6.30, and I told her  about it, so I got another one.  That's the first two Hummers I got in about three weeks, too. 
[00:05:30]  Well, there you go.  That means you've got to love us forever now.  Yes, I do.  I've been listening to you since May.  Oh, cool, man.  You guys are great.  We appreciate that.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye-bye.  That's interesting, because we only started here in mid-June.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I wonder who we were listening to.  And we've been here six months already.  That's incredible.  Another happy customer for the Tuesday Night Harbor Club.  Yeah.  So, could someone explain the impeachment hearings?  Oh. 
[00:06:00]  Does it mean anything to us?  No.  Are they going to impeach the President, Anthony?  No.  No.  He was absolutely wrong in what he did, but for some reason, he won't get impeached.  Now, you know what's going to happen?  There's a lame duck Congress taking care of this business right now.  We're going to impeach the President.  Now, the new Congress steps in after next year, start of next year, and they have to  start all over again.  Are you serious?  And all this cash, all this crap over again. 
[00:06:30]  So, why are they even bothering now?  Because it's their duty?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not going to get impeached.  His lawyers...  We're how far into this already?  It's been about almost a year.  Less months.  And let's see, the people that want him impeached, basically the Republicans, are saying that  he purged himself under oath in the civil case with Paula Jones. 
[00:07:00]  His attorneys are saying it wasn't perjury.  Yes, he did mislead some people, and what he did was not right, but it wasn't perjury and  not an impeachable offense.  So, that was when it first started.  Where are we now?  Same exact place.  Same place.  Nothing is getting done.  In the country.  In the country.  It doesn't matter.  Just, it keeps going and going, and it's crap.  I believe, yes, he should be impeached. 
[00:07:30]  What he did was wrong.  He is not fulfilling his oath of office to tell the truth.  Mm-hmm.  It's part of his oath, you know?  Especially with people serving time in prison for exactly what he has done.  The oath that he took when he gave his testimony.  Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  Everyone has seen it on TV a million times.  Well, did he tell the truth?  The whole truth, and nothing but the truth?  No, Anthony.  No.  So, it doesn't matter what the polls say.  It doesn't matter anything.  Well, didn't they bring up that point? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  That the people are sick of this, and we should just move on?  That's what his lawyers say.  The people have spoken.  They're tired of this, and think it should all be just thrown away.  Well, the truth of the matter is, the Constitution isn't a popularity poll.  It's not run by polls.  It's a written law, and if he did something that he should get impeached for, he should  get impeached, regardless of what the polls say.  Period.  But his lawyers are wrangling, and the other people on the other side are Ken Starr's people 
[00:08:30]  trying to get him to...  It's a mess.  It's a never-ending mess that won't be settled.  He'll just fill out the rest of his term.  That's it.  Do you think he'll prosecute him after he leaves office, though?  No.  No?  No.  What a waste of time.  It's just a huge waste of time, money, resources.  I would like to know what is not getting done in this country, because they're spending all  this time on this nonsense. 
[00:09:00]  A lot of things.  But then, Clinton, in a clever ruse, trying to make it look like he's doing things.  You see him out every day, and he's like, I'm talking about Social Security today.  He's not doing anything.  He's not doing anything that's ever going to get through Congress or anything.  He's pretty much a lame duck president at this point as well.  Exactly.  He's walking around, miserable than ever, because he can't get rid of Hillary for a second these  days to go get some trim, who may be named man of the year. 
[00:09:30]  Man of the year.  Well, really.  Time Magazine has their man of the year.  It may be Hillary Clinton.  She can be named man of the year?  Have you taken a look at her lately?  Of course you can.  Yeah, I know.  That's the easy joke.  Sorry.  Yeah, so it's just a never-ending mess that is just costing millions and millions of dollars  and time and work, hours. 
[00:10:00]  Nothing.  Yeah.  It's going to amount to nothing.  Yes.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Two for Tuesday, David Bowie.  Fashion from Scary Monsters.  One of those songs, when I hear it, it brings me right back to being a kid watching MTV when  it first hit the tube.  Yeah.  Because that was one of the first videos.  Fashion and, I am a DJ, I am what I play.  Very washed out looking video.  Yeah.  They've come a long way with the videos, but every time I hear that or, you know, Love 
[00:10:30]  is a Battlefield by Pat Benatar, Benatar, hate the song, but it brings me right back, you  know.  Blue Oyster Cult burning for you.  Yeah, they were standing on the cars that were on fire.  Remember that?  And J. Giles Centerfold.  Yeah.  These were all the early videos.  Look, dude, he's going to hit the snare drum and, like, white paint's going to come up.  Chilliwack.  Remember Chilliwack?  Gone, gone, gone, she's been gone so long, she's been gone, gone, gone, gone so long. 
[00:11:00]  That was, like, awful.  But we sat around and watched the videos.  Yeah.  And I don't know about you, but we would sit around and watch the whole rotation of the  videos.  All five.  Yeah, what did they really have?  Maybe, I don't know, two dozen?  Yeah.  And it would take maybe two or three hours to play through all of them, and we would sit  there and wait for Burning for you to come on again and realize, okay, we've seen all  the videos, time to go outside and play.  Then you'd have to sit through, well, they rewind the video, I guess. 
[00:11:30]  And, oh, there's a shot of the astronaut on the moon.  Yeah.  Oh, there's the Apollo rocket taking off.  Oh, this is great.  And then it would pop on Burning for You again.  Yeah.  Back to the beginning.  That was pretty much it.  They didn't really have many videos.  Now they don't either.  Yeah.  Now they just don't play. 
[00:12:00]  Now they just don't play videos on MTV.  They truly need to get another channel.  It's obvious.  They're so into the real world and the rules.  It's this week, the making of Road Rules Real World Reunion Contest Behind the Scenes  Camera People Makeup Technician Reunion Special Behind the Scenes.  They're just building ridiculous spinoffs from their show. 
[00:12:30]  Ridiculous.  This week, we're going to have the cast of the real world actually watch an episode and  comment while it's playing.  You, the viewer at home, could type in what you're seeing on the screen and we'll put those  comments up on the screen.  And then we'll throw in some Road Rule characters to give you a spin that way.  This will be really great.  People will love this.  And then all of a sudden, the real world will, you know, bump into a fanatic who's on their  way to see Mariah Carey. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Road Rules from the Winnebago's point of view.  Oh, we haven't seen that yet.  It's bad enough that they just show the episodes over and over and over again.  But now they got these new cool angles on the show.  Show some videos.  Yeah.  Even the videos that they think no one wants to see.  Because you know that musicians that were making videos that were on MTV years ago, they're  still making videos.  You know, they get money from somewhere, but you just never see them anymore. 
[00:13:30]  No.  Wouldn't you love to see what Kip Winger's up to right now?  Would that be a laugh just to sit there and watch a Kip Winger new video?  Yeah, I guess for a goof, I'd watch that.  Hey, it's Kip Winger.  Well, they got the Canadian music channel that's starting to pop up on all the cable  systems now.  Really?  What is it called?  Music or Muse or something?  Oh, yeah.  I don't get that.  You don't get that?  No.  They show all the videos, though.  I don't get that.  Nothing but videos. 
[00:14:00]  You don't have to sit through stupid TV shows.  No.  The only other video channel I get is BET.  Oh, yeah.  Black Entertainment Television.  I don't think you're allowed to watch BET.  No.  I shut the blinds and I watch on the floor, making sure that black people don't watch me  watching.  It's like, oh, this is what black people are up to.  Watch BET.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That is so slanted to the black race.  It's amazing. 
[00:14:30]  Absolutely amazing.  I guess that's how they feel when they're watching Tom Brokaw.  I guess.  I just don't get the new rap music, Opie.  I don't get it.  Like, I was watching the old rap music with, like, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince,  and they rapped to the music.  Now I watch it, and they're just, the beat's doing one thing, and they're off.  Yeah.  Doing something else.  So they're all right.  They're all right.  But it's all just this stream of consciousness. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Paying no attention to the music anymore.  Right.  I just like when, like, a Puff Daddy is on an award show, and then he talks about, you  know, his inspiration for writing a song and stuff, and I'm like, Puff, you haven't written  one song in your whole damn career.  You have sampled every song you've put out there.  So don't get up there and start talking about the, you know, you're writing inspiration  for this song, or that song, you know?  I know. 
[00:15:30]  Who's he going to rip off next?  That's his gig, man.  Just grab some tunes.  You know, you can grab some old tune and dedicate it to Biggie, and it makes a crap load of money.  I guess.  Well, as everyone knows by now, it's two for Tuesday, and it's also the Tuesday Night Hummer  Club.  Yes.  And we are initiating new members as we speak.  I'm looking at the clock.  Yes, it's after three o'clock.  That's when the initiation begins.  So there are people out there right now getting initiated as we speak, Anthony. 
[00:16:00]  It's a wonderful world.  Which is a scary thought, but there's a guy, I think his name is Ray or something like  that, on the line who needs help.  Oh, good.  We're good at this.  You know, getting a Hummer tonight because he wants to become a member of the club.  We usually call up wives and girlfriends on Tuesday for a couple of lucky guys, and we  usually talk the girls into initiating them into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Well, we failed for the first time last week.  I think she was brutal.  That lady we talked to last week was the reason why we came up with the Tuesday Night Hummer  Club.  Yeah.  She had the kids in the background. 
[00:16:30]  She works two jobs.  And it's obvious that couple just doesn't have a sex life anymore.  No.  God.  And that's why we started this club to maybe initiate some sparks in some people's relationships.  Bring it back before it gets to that point.  But we tried everything, and she was as cold as they come.  And it is obvious that sex is not a word in their dictionary.  Yeah.  I felt bad for the guy.  He'll end up cheating soon.  Well, let's see what this guy's all about.  Hey, Ray, I hear you need help becoming a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  My wife's a little gun shy.  You know, I've been asking her for a couple of weeks.  I think maybe a little push will help me out.  And when was the last time you got a lovely Hummer from your wife?  Oh, Saturday.  Saturday?  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  She just doesn't want to do it on a Tuesday?  Yeah, we just can't hook up on Tuesday.  She knows it's a radio thing.  You know.  Well, this guy seems a little greedy.  You are a little greedy.  Yeah, sure.  There are guys out there that haven't had a Hummer in years.  Well, shame on it.  Yeah, like Opie.  No, that's not true.  This guy just got one Saturday? 
[00:17:30]  You got one, what, three days ago?  We can't use our powers of Hummers to get your wife to do this if you just got one Saturday.  What about the poor guy?  Come on, you got it, guys.  Wait a minute, there's some guy out there driving down the road that hasn't had a Hummer in years going,  why are they calling this guy?  Well, it could be worse.  It could be me.  We need a charity case.  You're not a charity case.  Oh, come on.  What kind of club is it?  I mean, the more members, the better.  We've got to be millions strong here.  It seems to me like you could probably swing it yourself if you got one Saturday. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, well, I don't know.  I keep trying on Tuesdays and then she listens to you guys at home so she knows about it.  You know, it just doesn't seem to work on Tuesdays.  You know, Ray, as the grand poobah of the club, I think I'm going to have to pass on your charity case.  No way.  Hell yeah.  There are other guys more deserving out there.  Oh, man.  You'll be doing a grave disservice to those people that really need Hummers.  Now, I've been faithful, and that's terrible.  Our success rate is over 90%. 
[00:18:30]  I know.  Why do you think I'm calling?  That's why we've got to save for that special person that really needs the help.  Oh, that's terrible.  All right.  You know, the Make-A-Wish Foundation doesn't send kids with a cold to Disney.  Okay?  You get what we mean?  All right.  You guys are brutal.  All right, Ray.  All right, guys.  Thanks anyway.  All right.  See you.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Nirvana.  About a girl from the Unplugged CD.  Come as you are from Nevermind Before That. 
[00:19:00]  It's Opie and Anthony on Two for Tuesday.  There's a guy on the line that got his Hummer out of country.  Wow.  We've got to see what country he got his little Hummer.  Hi, N-E-W.  N-E-W.  Yeah, I'm looking for Opie and Anthony.  You are live on the air.  What's up?  Boys, I've got some exciting news to share.  All right.  In the home with the wife about a week ago.  We get up in the morning.  I get up to take a shower.  I get out of the shower and she's in the mood. 
[00:19:30]  Ah.  I'm already clean.  I'm already dried off.  I'm already deodoranted up.  All right.  Be careful how you talk about that.  It didn't feel like doing the act, if you know what I mean.  Oh, really?  So I told her, honey, I'll be more than happy to take care of business, but I'd like a Hummer.  And she said, no problem.  And I go, I'd like a Hummer next Tuesday.  Because I am very embarrassed to say, but I was not at that point a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  All right.  So you were going to save your Hummer to become a member. 
[00:20:00]  Absolutely.  Us guys, there's a lot of us out there.  We realize they don't come often and we got to kind of spread them out.  You got it, fellas.  To make them worthwhile.  But now I wanted to put my name in stone, so to speak.  And I know you guys are probably going to be working on the bylaws of the club since it's growing at such a rapid rate.  Yeah.  And I wanted to be a little special in the process.  So I knew I was going to be going on vacation.  So that Tuesday, I was going to be out of this country in Aruba. 
[00:20:30]  Oh.  So I was hoping that I am the first reported inductee into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club outside the country of the USA.  I would have to give you that honor.  Thank you very much.  Because no one else has called us on that.  Don't you guys have like a soundtrack of applause or something?  Oh, no.  We're very cheap around here.  We're a cheap radio show here.  Yeah.  Well, at least you guys respect it.  That's cool.  Just wanted to share that.  Well, we'll find out if anyone can beat that.  All right, buddy.  You became a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club in Aruba.  Absolutely. 
[00:21:00]  I think someone out there might be able to beat you, but we'll find out.  Well, we found the first reported one.  Yes, the first reported.  Thank you.  Very good.  Congratulations.  Thanks, guys.  All right, man.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye.  It makes people so happy.  You can just feel it out there.  You do.  I don't think it's Christmas coming around or anything that's so joyous.  Yeah.  I think people, the Hummer Club, is making them happy and joyful.  I would have to agree with that, Anthony.  So would I.  We got our affiliate from San Francisco on the line here, Anthony.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:21:30]  In case you didn't hear, there was a huge power failure out in San Francisco.  Everything went out.  Everything.  Not just a couple neighborhoods.  The whole city went out.  They were finally restoring power, but it's taken some time.  They got the airport up and running again.  But traffic lights were out.  Entire neighborhoods.  The transit system.  Everything.  It was a complete mess.  And we figured this was just such a huge story that we would get one of our affiliates on the line  and discuss the mood of the city of San Francisco. 
[00:22:00]  Well, I think so, because on the way in, I was listening to 1010 Winds,  and they had somebody from San Francisco that used to work at Winds.  And now they work for an affiliate out there.  So I guess this is somebody from our sister station in San Francisco.  Yes, I believe that's what this is, Anthony.  All right.  Okay.  I think his name is Phillip or something like that.  Hi, boys.  It's Phillip Eaton Cox here in the city by the bay, San Francisco.  Wait a minute.  Your name is Phillip Eaton Cox?  Yes, it's spelled with a hyphen. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, okay.  I'm here in the city by the bay, San Francisco.  Here we've been plunged into darkness by a huge power failure.  But the mood here remains upbeat and gay.  Well, let us know what's going on.  Well, the brave men of the San Francisco Fire Department are on the scene making sure no one gets hurt.  Maybe you can hear their sirens whaling in the background, Opie and Anthony.  All right.  I was just speaking to Captain Dirk Studley, and he says due to the power outage, many elevators are stuck between floors with the doors open. 
[00:23:00]  Very dangerous.  So here, everybody's been warned to, um, oh, I never thought I'd say this.  Stay away from the shaft.  Please stay away from the shaft.  Oh, it is a sad day in Francisco.  That would be the elevator shaft.  Okay.  Yes, yes.  I must say it was very frightening when the lights went out. 
[00:23:30]  I was deep inside Bart.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  When all of a sudden...  Huh?  What?  You were deep inside Bart?  You can't say that.  Bart, the Bay Area Rapid Transit.  It's the subway, silly.  Oh, and it's called Bart?  Yes.  Oh, all right.  Oh, you don't know that?  No, I didn't know that.  I don't think anyone knew that.  Deep in the bowels of Bart.  When the lights went out.  But during this difficult time, everyone here is standing very closely behind each other.  Ooh. 
[00:24:00]  Well, boys, before it gets dark, I've got to find some D-sized batteries.  Where do I find those big D-sized batteries for the black lights?  I have no idea.  Oh, well.  Philip Eaton Cox with a hyphen.  Live from the city by the bay.  Frisco.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Oh, bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye, Philip.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  Our affiliate in San Francisco.  Didn't even know we had one. 
[00:24:30]  No, I did not know that.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Leonard Skinner.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks.  And it is the Tuesday Night Hummer Club that is happening right now.  Mm-hmm.  This was in the wrong CD case, Rick.  Oops.  I'm livid.  Somebody is just not with the program around here.  You know, I'm freaking pissed off.  I want to break something. 
[00:25:00]  They keep putting the wrong CDs in the CD cases around here.  That should be the easiest thing to do, right?  You look at the CD.  You see the name on it.  This is market numero uno.  Numero uno, Claire.  It should be easy to put the CD in the right case.  But no.  We got burned twice last week and we just got burned now.  At least this time it was a good Leonard Skinner song.  Last week we were supposed to play a Bad Company song or, no, a Kenny Wayne Shepard song. 
[00:25:30]  We ended up playing a Disco Queen song.  For two seconds.  We have enough forces that are, you know, fighting against us.  Yeah.  Without our own people not concentrating and putting the CDs back in the right CD cases.  I wonder how that happens.  Is it on purpose?  Do you think it's a sabotage?  I have some theories, Anthony, but maybe I should just shut my mouth this time around.  It's like I was going to try to just move on with the program, but then you just get so pissed off. 
[00:26:00]  We have enough problems trying to rebuild this radio station.  We don't need people making dumb mistakes.  Well, there you go.  Anyway, where were we?  We're all back.  Back in order now.  Yes.  Well, people are becoming members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club as we speak.  And from time to time.  Actually, we do it every week.  We get some couples that need a little help to get their Hummers going. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  This is kind of good, too, because I think even at this point, Opie and I put our differences aside as far as the Hummer Club goes.  And we try to help out.  Me, right now, on a voluntary basis, because I am under suspension.  Yes.  I think Opie has found it in his heart to put me under, like, house arrest.  Yes.  So I can still help out.  Yeah.  We'll see how well you do the next couple weeks.  But if we're going to reinstate you or not.  I think I still want to bring up the tape, Opie.  Well, you...  Now, I think I have a right. 
[00:27:00]  We just might not have time for the tape today is the problem, though, Anthony.  I don't think so.  If you've got this tape, you know, you'll have your day in court, and you'll be able to air it on the air.  But I think there's too much going on in our show today to get to your little issue.  But like I said, we will put our differences aside for right now and help people who really need the help.  I mean, my God, we've got to play the gerbil song today, Anthony.  I hear the pork guy is coming in to sing a Christmas song.  I think that's the stuff people want to hear today. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, wow.  It's not your little issue with who is the grand poobah of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  All right?  Anyway, we've got someone standing by here that wants to become a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  All right.  Let's go.  It's a girl.  What?  It's Kira.  Kira.  All right.  Well, let's talk to her.  Because remember, the ladies become members of the club as well.  It's not just a male club.  You know, the guy getting the Hummer and the girl, you know, giving. 
[00:28:00]  They're both members of the club.  And I guess she needs some help initiating her husband into the club.  Put her on.  N.E.W., what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I'd like you to call my husband and try to get him into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  But he leaves work at five, so...  Oh, this is a little change, huh?  Yeah.  Well, what is the problem?  He doesn't like Hummers?  No, he's just kind of like sex drive's a little bit lower than, you know, I'd like. 
[00:28:30]  So I'm trying to initiate things.  This is awesome.  All right.  No, we...  It's our responsibility.  The tides have changed.  What's your name?  Kira.  And what's his name?  Chris.  All right, Kira.  Let's call him right now.  All right.  You'll be able to listen in, so here we go.  Good afternoon.  Mason speaking.  Yes, it's Chris...  Sure.  Hold on a minute.  Going well so far?  This is Chris.  Hi, Chris.  This is Opie and Anthony from WNEW Radio.  We got you live on the air.  Uh-oh.  Do you listen to our show?  Uh, no. 
[00:29:00]  Ah!  Well, we got a lovely surprise for you today.  Okay.  We have started a new club on our radio show.  Okay.  Called the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Okay.  And that's where we encourage the guys to get Hummers from their wives or girlfriends.  These guys love Hummer.  And we think it would make the world a better, happier, less violent place if everybody was  just smiling because they had received Hummers.  Would you agree with us? 
[00:29:30]  That I can't argue with.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, believe it or not, your wife told us to call you because she wants you to become  a member of this club tonight.  Now, I think I know what your answer is.  That, that, yeah.  But would you enjoy a Hummer tonight?  Yes.  Yes, that would be.  Wow.  Big ol' yes.  Big ol' yes.  Well, I think you got something special waiting for you when you come home tonight, Chris.  From the sound of it, yeah.  And I do believe if you do get a Hummer tonight that you're going to have to start listening 
[00:30:00]  to the Opie and Anthony show every day.  Yep, yep.  I would say so.  Yeah, there's nobody else.  If Fat Rocky isn't getting you Hummers.  You know, Fat Rocky can't even find his thing yet.  What seems to be the problem?  Is your sex drive dipping down a little bit?  Oh, well, hey, you know, that, let's just say the Tuesday thing definitely would bring  it back up again.  Oh.  All right, all right.  That's good.  See, we like catching these things and nipping them in the bud because if too many years 
[00:30:30]  go by with the sex dropping off in a relationship, sometimes you reach a point of no return.  We've talked to some of these people in relationships where it's just over and never happening again.  Never can happen again, yeah.  How long have you been married?  Two years.  Two years.  Well, you guys should be going at it like rabbits.  Yeah, why do you think your sex drive has dropped a bit?  Oh, well, God only knows.  Just too busy with work and everything else?  Yeah, yeah, you know, the day-to-day nonsense. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, would you like to talk to your wife?  I think I'll talk to her when I get home.  Hey, Kira.  Kira.  Kira.  Ah.  Is she on?  Hold on one sec.  You've got to at least say hi to her.  Okay.  Kira.  Hello.  Say hi to Chris.  Hi, honey.  Hello.  Hi.  Do you know who you're on the radio with? 
[00:31:30]  Yes, I figured it out.  I thought I was being, you know, taken for a ride there for a minute.  So what do you say?  Well, that would be a yes, a big old yes.  Good.  Very good.  Did it take much convincing?  No.  Okay.  All right.  Well, I said I should listen to the radio and see what they say.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll see you later.  I love you.  I love you, too.  Bye-bye. 
[00:32:00]  Bye-bye.  Look at that.  Another happy couple, huh?  Have fun tomorrow, Chris.  Thank you much.  All right.  And there he goes.  See?  He's going to have some fun.  He sure is.  Happy God.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Two for Tuesday with Neil Young.  This note's for you live and rocking in the free world.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Don't forget, it's another WNEW exclusive broadcast. 
[00:32:30]  Lenny Kravitz concert special happening this Thursday at 10 p.m.  Right here on the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  It's a concert recorded during his October tour, which was very, very, very good.  All right.  We have another couple standing by that needs help becoming members of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club.  We'll get to them in a little while.  All right.  Related little note, an email here from Ed in Jersey.  Just got home from work.  Had to give you some feedback.  I'd like to leave a big F you to Ray. 
[00:33:00]  What a weasel trying to use up your powers of persuasion.  Yes, of course.  When there are so many out there in need, keep up the mission of mercy.  Good work.  Here, Ray calls us up and says, here, call my wife and try to get me inducted into the  Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Like, all right, we've done this before.  Asked him when the last time he got a Hummer was.  What does he say?  Saturday.  Saturday.  Saturday.  We're going to the phones.  There are guys that haven't had Hummers in this decade.  And Ray wants us to help him out. 
[00:33:30]  And he had a Hummer on Saturday.  Call us for that.  Greedy, greedy.  That's got to be a serious charity case.  I think we got one standing by.  So stick around for that.  What else is the instant feedback saying?  Well, I got to say the number one request coming in over the instant feedback is the gerbil song.  Our new pal, Stephen Lynch, from Friday.  Yeah, Friday.  He did a bunch of songs for us.  Fun ditties.  My favorite still is the Special Olympics song. 
[00:34:00]  But I think the gerbil song comes a close second.  Very twisted.  Well, I'll be honest.  No one told us that we can't play this song.  So I guess we keep playing until they tell us we can't play this one.  Roll tape, people.  Roll tape.  That'll probably happen right after we play it.  Should we call Scott upstairs and ask him if we can play this song or should we just play it again?  Oh, you want to call him?  No.  No?  What if he says no?  Then we look like...  Yeah, just play it.  Well, the phones are going nuts.  Everyone's requesting more Stephen Lynch songs. 
[00:34:30]  We'll try to get another one on before we get out of here at 7, all right?  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Tom Petty, into the great wide open, and you're so bad from full moon fever.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  And we have a very, very busy show happening.  Yes, we do.  As we speak.  A lot of listeners becoming members of the Tuesday Night Humber Club as we speak.  And we try to help out the people.  Yes.  That's our mission.  Well, we had a couple on the air about, what, 35 minutes ago? 
[00:35:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we were successful.  Yes, we were.  Which is great.  We've only failed once in our attempt to get people hummers.  Yeah.  Boy, she was a wreck.  Last week?  Yeah.  We should replay that.  It's terrible.  She was so cold, you could just feel the ice in her veins.  Yeah.  Through the speakers.  But we've had more success today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we got another case on the line here.  All right.  Let's see if we can help these guys out.  N.E.W. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, how are you doing?  My name is Tony, the limo driver.  I'm in desperate need of help.  I haven't gotten a hummer in about four to five months.  Four to five months?  Yeah.  What is the problem?  My wife just doesn't like doing it.  When we were dating, she could start a leaf blow.  But now, you know.  We got to talk to the ladies today and get in their heads why all of a sudden after they  get married, they're just not into it anymore.  Even sex.  It's like I have to initiate everything.  If it wasn't for me, we wouldn't have sex and she's pregnant. 
[00:36:00]  She's four months pregnant.  I'm thinking, how the hell did she get pregnant?  You know, was it divine intervention?  I don't know.  But I don't ask this lady for nothing.  You know, I work 12 hours a day.  I give her my whole paycheck.  I don't ask for nothing.  My birthday's coming up.  I said, don't give me nothing.  All I want is sex.  And, you know, it's like I'm asking for a heart transplant.  You know, that is the best Christmas present a lady could give their man this season.  That's right.  Screw the ties and the stupid cute socks. 
[00:36:30]  I don't want anything, guys.  Guys, I'm easy.  I like watching my football and that's it.  Don't bother me.  Exactly.  You know.  So before you got married, were you guys just two animals or?  Yeah, she was hot.  We used to do it in her house, in her mother's house when her mother was home sleeping.  We'd do it on top of the washing machine in the bathroom.  How long have they been married?  You know, I've been married only four years.  Oh, my God.  Do you know what's going to happen as every year goes by?  Guys, I'm going to be 31 this Friday. 
[00:37:00]  You know, even if it wasn't this Tuesday tonight, maybe she could do it for my birthday this Friday.  Oh, this guy sounds like a good case.  Yeah, I mean, it's tough, you know.  I get home.  I leave my house every 30 in the morning.  I come home 9 o'clock at night.  And all you want is a little oral satisfaction.  That's right.  And you'll sleep better.  You'll be happier.  You'll leave some stress.  You'll even do some chores around the house, probably, because it just doesn't matter after that.  What's her name?  My name is Alexandra.  She works out in New Jersey.  All right, hold on a line.  We're going to give her a call right now. 
[00:37:30]  Thank you.  We've got to take care of this.  Yeah, this sounds bad.  Hello?  Yes?  Hi, this is Opie and Anthony from NW.  Can I help you?  Yes, we're calling you.  How are you?  Fine.  Have you heard about our Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  No.  Oh.  Well, Anthony, why don't you explain it to her?  Well, you've been married four years now to Anthony?  Yes.  Yeah.  And over those four years, maybe things, maybe they're a little different than they were when you first got together. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that happens in every marriage, I know.  You know, I've been married for a while now.  And, well, there's a certain thing that guys really enjoy that would really make them happy.  And that's why we started this Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Jeez, I don't know how to put this.  Well, Anthony is wondering if you would give him a Hummer tonight. 
[00:38:30]  Hello?  Hello.  Hello?  Alex.  Hello?  Dude, she hung up, man.  Oh, man.  She hung up.  Bitch.  Oh, my God.  This is a lot more serious than we first thought.  Houston, we have a problem.  Wow.  We might have made it even worse for you. 
[00:39:00]  My wife's left, so she has a bit of a temper.  Hey, you know what the funny thing is, guys?  Huh?  I took her out of the ghetto, and this is the thanks I get.  Oh, man.  A new house, a new car, a beautiful daughter, you know.  Wait a minute.  Should we call her back?  Maybe she misunderstood.  You can cry.  Maybe if I just tell her to listen to you guys, maybe she doesn't know I'm there, too.  All right.  All right.  Well, dude, we're going to have to let you fly on this one.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Let us know what happens.  I'll give you guys a call.  All right, man. 
[00:39:30]  Bye.  Uh-oh.  There is no way we're calling that lady back.  No, no, no.  There is no love connection there tonight.  She just hung up on us.  Yeah, she didn't even want to acknowledge us.  Poor guy.  Sometimes we do.  It's like a gamble.  You take a gamble.  Yeah.  You might get the Hummer, or you might just make it ten times worse.  Yeah, we make it worse for some couples, and we could make dreams happen as well.  All right, Anthony, we've got to talk about take pause real fast here. 
[00:40:00]  Uh-oh.  Christmas coming up.  What do you do, Opie?  What do you do?  Well, you look for something different and special.  Mm-hmm.  And I think take pause might be your ticket if you've got someone special in your life.  I think you're right.  There's a bunch of cute jungle animals.  That's what they are.  Mm-hmm.  We've seen them.  They look great.  They're well-made.  And I think anybody would love getting one of these.  You feel loved.  Yes.  When you get one.  Well, they're tigers.  They've got the white Bengal tiger.  They've got the leopard. 
[00:40:30]  They've got the panther, lion, or a Siberian tiger.  Mm-hmm.  And they're collectibles just like the Beanie Babies and Hummels and stuff like that.  Other family members will follow once this first generation is retired.  So they're going to retire it, which will make it more valuable for you.  Right.  And they're very cool.  Anthony brought one home to his wife, Jennifer, and she absolutely loved it.  Oh, she does?  You figured she would probably throw it in the corner with the rest of her stuffed animals,  maybe appreciate it for a couple hours, and then just kind of throw it aside, right?  Yeah.  But this one, it's really lifelike. 
[00:41:00]  It looks at you.  Its eyes kind of follow you around.  Mm-hmm.  It's got like real-life eyes.  It scares the hell out of our cats.  Really?  Yeah.  Like one of our cats walks up to it and like taps it on the nose.  Whish, whish, whish, whish, whish, whish.  Like, wham, runs away.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  And you don't have to take our word for it.  If you're online right now, you can go to their website and check out some pictures of the Take Paws pets.  Their website is www.takepause, with a Z, at the end, dot com. 
[00:41:30]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with live.  That's Pain Lies on the Riverside.  From mental jewelry and lightning crashes before that, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, on the way, we're going to be doing another episode, I guess, of the Furby Police, Anthony.  Furby Police.  We have a lot of people selling Furbies, those cuddly little pieces of crap that people are paying upwards of $300, $500 a clip for.  For a kid's toy that costs $29.95. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, so people are selling these in the newspaper.  And we give them hell.  We call up their number and give them the hell that they so rightly deserve.  Yes, and Dan sent an email.  It says, call these dickheads and give them some S.  And it's an ad for Furbies.  Furbies.  Only a few left, unopened in box, $300 to $500 each.  Call Blum Blum Blum in Jersey.  Huh.  All right, we'll do that one next.  All right.  And we're going to play another song from Stephen Lynch in a little while. 
[00:42:30]  Good, which one?  The little, the lullaby.  Oh, yeah.  That he sung to his little daughter after his wife left him.  Oh, very touching song.  Very touching song.  Whoa!  That's a great song to crank out tonight, huh?  Yeah.  As we get new members to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, it's two for Tuesday with Van Hale and Ice Cream Man and Where Have All the Good Times Gone.  Both songs are very appropriate for a lot of couples out there. 
[00:43:00]  Thus, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Anthony?  Yes.  How many new members do you think we're initiating as we do our program today?  You know, I can't even imagine.  I don't know.  It's got to be thousands.  You think we're going to get thousands of new members this week?  I think so.  Very cool.  Very cool.  I like hearing from you guys as you're getting it on the highway on the way home.  Thanks for that.  We appreciate it.  What is up with that?  I don't know.  It's dangerous.  I mean, we're happy for you, but I just don't want to hear the guy's, well, you can figure it out. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  I'd rather hear the girl.  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  Anyway, on the way, we got the Furby police.  Mm-hmm.  We've been calling this guy, but so far we're getting a machine.  That's why we'll keep trying, obviously.  Yeah.  We've got to get these people.  Yeah, because this guy is just selling Furbies like they're going out of style.  Got an ad here from someone that Dan sent it in to us, and they're just selling them for between $300 and $500 each for a Furby doll. 
[00:44:00]  Come on.  They only have a few left.  They're in unopened boxes.  Call now.  Some guy in Jersey.  So we'll do that in a little bit, okay?  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday, with Pearl Jam, Immortality from Vitalogy, an elderly woman behind the counter in a small town.  My personal favorite, Anthony.  Yeah, I know that.  I say it every time we play it.  Yeah.  All right.  God, there's a bunch of people on hold that are becoming members of the club as we speak. 
[00:44:30]  It's great.  We know it.  It's just the way it is.  People love it.  Love the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Let's talk to one of these guys.  IADW.  Hey, I joined the club.  Congratulations.  Hey, you know, a couple weeks ago, I was only a partial member.  Tonight, full-blown member, if you know what I mean.  When did it go down, so to speak?  About an hour ago.  Right on.  You guys are dynamite. 
[00:45:00]  Love listening to you.  You were listening to our show when it was going down?  Yeah, sure was.  Oh, God.  What were we talking about, or what song were we playing?  I don't remember now.  I was busy concentrating on other things.  Good boy.  Good boy.  Thanks a lot.  Take it easy.  Congratulations.  Thanks.  Bye.  Look how happy that guy sounds.  I know.  Amazing.  It's only Tuesday.  It's only Tuesday, and now he's got the rest of the week to look forward to.  He's very happy and content.  He had a Friday attitude right there.  Yeah.  You know? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And there's about ten others on hold just waiting to talk to us, to bow to us.  Because I'm assuming if we get you guys Hummers, that you've got to become faithful listeners  of our show after that.  We need a little payback here.  I mean, that's why we're trying this stuff, you know?  You're not going to get Fat Rocky.  You won't get Hummers over there.  No, you won't.  It ain't happening.  No.  Homo Urban Station that just changed over?  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  That ain't going to get you Hummers.  No.  Mike and the Mad Dog, they're too busy talking about the NBA strike.  They're not going to get you Hummers.  They're still taking calls over there on the fan.  Hey, what do you think of that Jets touchdown, huh?  Hey, Mike, I don't think that was a touchdown.  Yeah, you're right.  You know, I think he was short of that, and the replay showed that.  Yeah, thanks, man.  Hey, you're on the air.  Hey, this is Mike and the Mad Dog.  Am I going to Mad Dog? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, what can I do for you?  Boy, I want to get off the subject a little bit.  Talk about something completely different.  Okay.  Man, I don't think that was a touchdown, that Jets game, huh?  Well, I think they need to bring the replay back, huh?  Yeah, I think maybe they've got to bring that replay back.  You know, you get that over there.  Yeah.  And here we're getting you Hummers.  We're getting you Hummers, for God's sake.  That's pretty amazing, if you think about it.  What else do we have to do?  Right. 
[00:47:00]  That is pretty amazing.  Yeah, well, just trying to make you happy.  If you look at your options on the dial, I think this is the place to be, on Tuesdays, at least.  Yeah.  We better come up with a theme every day of the week, and we'll be all set, I think.  All right, do we have time to try this guy selling the Furbies again?  Yeah, this guy just deserves some pounding.  Yes, I want to thank Dan, I shouldn't give his last name, of Park Ridge, New Jersey.  He found an ad, and this reads here, call these dickheads and give them some S. 
[00:47:30]  Furbies for sale, only a few left, unopened, in a box, $300 to $500 each.  Oh, come on.  Call Blah Blah at Blah Blah.  Gives the name of the guy, his first and last name and everything.  So, we obviously got to mess with this guy a bit here.  Of course.  What angle do you want to take?  Well, Opie, I might be representing the toy company.  Really?  Yes.  Who are you?  I'm an attorney.  Let's just leave it at that. 
[00:48:00]  You're an attorney?  Yes.  All right, let's give this guy a call and mess with him a little bit.  It's the Furby police, everyone.  Hello?  Hello, is this some f***ing bill residents?  Yes, it is.  You have an ad in the newspaper?  Right.  My name's Barry Levin.  I'm an attorney for Hasbro Toys.  Right.  What are you selling these for?  How much, sir?  At this point, we haven't made a price yet.  Well, we've done a few preliminary calls and you are charging an exorbitant amount of money for these toys. 
[00:48:30]  Do you know this is illegal, sir?  I thought as of last year, it wasn't illegal.  Well, it is very illegal.  Now, how much have you made selling these, sir?  As of right now, nothing.  That is not the information I have.  No.  I have that, Mr. B***er, I have that you have made quite a few dollars off of these toys.  Well, I don't know where you got that information from.  Believe me, this is a serious matter.  I wouldn't start laughing.  I'm not laughing, sir.  You're a 394, m***er, haven't you?  Yes.  Okay.  How do you feel we should resolve this, sir? 
[00:49:00]  You tell me.  You're the attorney.  I mean, like...  I'm trying to...  Listen to me.  I am listening to you, sir.  Buddy, I'm trying to make it easy for you, sir.  Okay.  I'm trying to make it easy for you.  You be honest with me.  You know, as of last year, the law says you could spend up to 15 years in prison for this, sir.  No, I didn't.  Do you know that, sir?  I just told you that as of last year, from what I heard, that it wasn't illegal.  Now, you tell me how much you've made from these.  I told you.  As of right now, nothing.  You're lying.  Now, why would I lie to you, sir?  To stay out of trouble, probably. 
[00:49:30]  No, if I'm trying to stay out of trouble, I'm telling you what I know.  I told you I haven't sold any as of yet.  All right, Mr. Bill, how many do you have in your possession right now?  Ten.  Ten.  Well, actually, less than ten.  Well, what is it?  Ten, five, you know, anything more than ten, you could get 30 years in prison.  And people in prison don't take too kindly to people selling children's toys for large amounts of money, sir.  Now, how many do you have?  I'm trying to get two more, and I have one, two, three, like five.  And I'm trying to buy five. 
[00:50:00]  I was going to buy five for someone else.  Where did you get these, sir?  At a toy store.  At a toy store.  Yes.  Is there a park nearby your house, sir?  A park?  A park.  That maybe we can meet at and settle this, like, gentleman?  How would that be?  You say you have ten of these left.  No, I have five.  I'm trying to buy five.  You have five left.  Five for 75 each or for someone else.  75 each.  So you're going to be selling them for a lot more than that, I take it.  No, I told them.  Probably, if I was going to sell them, I would try and get, like, 125. 
[00:50:30]  125.  Yes.  All right, I'll tell you what.  What's the name of the park near your house?  Um, park.  All right, here's the deal.  Meet me at park in two hours.  Bring the five remaining Furby dolls.  Give them to me.  And a job.  And I'll let you go.  You keep dreaming.  I'm serious, Mr. B***ville.  I'm serious with you, too, sir.  You know, this is a crime.  Five years in prison or b*** me.  Do you know that I have you on tape, sir?  Five years in prison or b*** me.  I have you on tape, sir. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  He was stuttering there for a little while.  I like the choice of music for the Furby police.  How did Charlie's Angels get on it?  I don't know, but I'm thinking of angels.  Angels, they're a Furby's.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm thinking of big cans now.  I am, too.  Cheryl Ladd, the underwater scene.  Oh, it's a nice pair of Furby's. 
[00:51:30]  Started out with SWAT, went into the Rookies, and ended with Charlie's Angels.  There you have it, the Furby police on the Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony, cigars around the world.  The original Cigar of the Month Club.  Great idea for Christmas.  You got a cigar aficionado around the house, you know?  They go out and get their box of cigars.  This is good.

It's cigars around the world.  Give them a call.  1-800-FRESH-66.  That's 1-800-F-R-E-S-H-66. 
[00:53:00]  I can't believe we have to spell that out for people.  Hey, I hear you have a quick Hummer joke.  Hey, Hummer joke.  Hey, you know what you call eight days of hummus?  What?  Hanako Goinski.  Hmm.  So glad we picked that call.  You like that, don't you?  Oh, it's the best joke I've ever heard in my life.  Hanako Goinski.  Yeah, I liked it when I first heard it. 
[00:53:30]  I told you guys well.  All right.  All right.  Oh, that was really a good joke.  Hanako Goinski.  That's Zaynorific.  Check, please.  They probably heard it on the Scott and Todd show  and decided to recycle it to our listeners.  Great.  Thanks for that.  That's awesome.  Super Tuesday.  Mama Ken.  Same old song and dance.  On the Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  And congratulations once again to Mike Moran of Paramus, New Jersey.  He was the winner of the Joe Perry Private Guitar Lesson 
[00:54:00]  and the Gibson Guitar during the Aerosmith Ticket Blitz weekend we did this past weekend.  And this coming weekend, we got family four packs to see Roger Daltrey  and a Christmas Carol at the theater at Madison Square Garden.  That's going to be cool.  Roger D.  Did you see that last year, the Christmas Carol?  No.  No, you saw...  Oh, never mind.  You saw Tommy.  Yeah, that was...  Was that last year?  Yeah.  No, no.  Tommy was a few years ago.  I saw that.  And then Quadrophenia.  No, well...  Oh, wait.  They went around and did...  Which one was with Billy Idol, Tommy? 
[00:54:30]  Quadrophenia.  Quadrophenia.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And what did Billy Idol play in that?  Oh, you know, he was the punky guy.  Yeah, okay.  And who else was in it?  That...  Who was that guy?  Hey!  Gary Glitter.  Gary Glitter, yeah.  Right before he got arrested for Kitty Porn.  Yeah, lovely.  Oh, the bellboy.  Yeah, that was it.  Thanks, Carol.  Appreciate it.  Billy Idol.  Thanks for the hell.  Bellboy.  Yeah.  Jesus. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  That was so important for our show.  Thanks, Carol.  We couldn't do it without you.  She's just trying to help open it.  I understand that.  We love Carol now.  Right, Carol?  Okay, great.  All right, where were we?  Oh, now I'm supposed to find out where we were.  I know that the phone lines are very busy.  See, now she has to come in.  I'll tell you how much I love you.  I'm not even putting a mic on for you, so you better shout. 
[00:55:30]  Don't put a mic on.  I love you guys.  I said we love you now.  I'm cool.  Okay.  Aren't you happy I didn't resign?  No comment.  I said I like you, but I'm not going there.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You do sound great on the air, Carol.  Okay, bye-bye.  All right.  At least you don't play solitaire during your show like other jocks around here.  I've been waiting to say that for two hours because someone screwed up our music earlier. 
[00:56:00]  You might have been listening.  Okay, great.  That was way too inside for the listeners, but.  All right.  What, uh, oh, we got this lady standing by.  She's got a solution for, um, the ladies out there that may be too busy to give their men or man a Hummer.  All right.  She's got some kind of wacky scheme.  Okay.  Let's listen. 
[00:56:30]  Let's take a listen.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi.  Hi.  Um, I have a solution for that evil woman you spoke to last week.  Okay.  Um, I did this two years ago with my boyfriend.  It's a schedule of Hummer points.  For all the help he gives me around the house, he earned Hummer points.  And 20 Hummer points were, uh, he can transfer in for a Hummer.  Wow, that is cool.  And let's see.  What is, like, the point system?  Give us some examples.  Um, washing dishes was one Hummer point per item washed. 
[00:57:00]  Vacuuming was five points.  Um, uh, dinner, meal preparation was, for a full dinner, it was 15 points.  Burgers was eight points.  If he called for delivery, he got one point.  If he paid for it, he got five.  Try not.  Um, points must be earned and presented prior to receiving any portion of a Hummer.  Uh-huh.  No credit will be given under any circumstances.  Hummer points may be deemed Monday through Friday, 9 to 11.  Saturday, Sunday, and holiday hours will be determined on a per-day basis,  in conjunction with planned activities and the whereabouts of the Hum giver's children. 
[00:57:30]  Hummer points are not transferable, except to my close friends,  and can be redeemed only by an experienced Hum giver.  Do not try and redeem these points with an amateur, no matter how tempting it may seem.  Fraudulent redemption may result in extreme damage to the Hummy's personal property.  Now, I did this two years ago.  Uh-huh.  It worked great.  He worked his butt off.  He was a happy man.  So, the girl who had too much to do, and that's what, she had two jobs, she had kids,  she was helping with the homework last week.  Yeah.  This would have worked. 
[00:58:00]  Of course it would have.  And then you have little tickets that have one Hummer point per and five Hummer points,  and you hand them to him when he does his stuff.  When he collects his 20, he turns them in.  Now, how many Hummers was he getting a month?  My house was so clean.  You have no clue.  And his pipes were very clean.  It was a wonderful thing.  It really was.  This is bribery.  I don't like it.  I like it a lot.  This is not bribery.  Oh, my God.  The grand poobah likes this.  I was settled for this in a second.  You're being manipulated by this.  No way.  I'm like, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:58:30]  I'm on your side this time, because, you know.  Well, then you better explain it to this man, because I work full time.  I have two kids.  I do the same thing.  The spirit of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club has nothing to do with working for it.  I bet you if we took a poll right now.  Wait, wait, wait.  I bet you, wait, wait.  I bet you if we took a poll right now, there are guys that would go for this idea in a second.  All they had to do was vacuum four times a week.  Oh, my God.  Vacuum four times a week.  Or do the pool box.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There's your pool box selling you down the road.  Wait a minute.  Open the pool box selling you out, guys. 
[00:59:00]  If I was guaranteed to get a Hummer every time I collected 20 points just doing stupid  chores around the house, I would easily go for that.  Not the spirit of the Hummer Club, which is just to please get a Hummer.  Now we're into housework and chores.  No, no, no.  We're into a solution.  Point systems.  This is exactly how things stop happening in a relationship.  We got to charge somewhere, though.  Because all the guys who are calling are saying the wives work.  They got this.  They're too tired.  They're too this.  Hey, keep them from getting tired. 
[00:59:30]  I hope he loves it.  Great.  There's your pool box.  There's your pool box.  Now go put on your apron, guys, and vacuum, and do the dishes to earn your Hummer.  Hey, man, that's great.  And if you could get a woman to follow you around on her knees while you're doing this,  you wouldn't be doing it?  Great.  There you go.  Well, thank you.  Take a survey.  All right.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye, guys.  Wonderful.  Great, great.  Good.  So you know what happens after time?  The guy doesn't do the work, and the girl doesn't give the Hummers.  And what do you have?  Marriage. 
[01:00:00]  You have the exact problem we're trying to remedy with the point system that Opie, your pool  ba, people, just agreed with and thought it was a great idea.  Well, I...  What other great ideas do you have up your sleeve, pool ba?  Well, I am the acting grand pool ba because I finally became a member last week, Anthony.  Man, screwing it up pretty quick.  I'll be honest.  It's not fun being the grand pool ba at this club.  There's too much pressure.  Well, when you come up with dopey ideas like that, and I have a tape that proves that it 
[01:00:30]  was Opie's idea for the three-month limit on the Hummer Club, on the three-month membership  expiration.  Meaning you only had to get a Hummer every three months?  That wasn't the essence of it, but you turned around and said that that's what I said.  Meanwhile, I have a tape in my possession that has Opie saying that there should be a  three-month limit.  It was Opie's idea.  And now he puts this girl on the air that's talking about point systems and work. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, guys, great.  What is he?  A guy's got to be like paw ingles out in the field or turning butter before he can get  a Hummer now?  Now, Anthony, where is this...  Here's your poobah.  Where is this so-called tape?  I have it.  Where?  Right in my bag.  And I've made other copies.  I put one in my safety deposit box that if anything should happen to me, it's to be  played.  And this will show that I am guilty of suggesting that memberships run out if you don't get a 
[01:01:30]  Hummer every month.  Yes, there's your poobah.  This tape right here?  Yes, it is.  What I need you guys to do is to explain to my husband on the air that he doesn't have  to renew his membership every week.  Well, the rule states that once you're in, you're in.  But honestly, I think there should be an expiration date on...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Here you go.  No, no, no.  Here you go.  Let the tape play.  No, no.  Where'd you get that tape?  Truth.  Let the truth come out.  No, no, no. 
[01:02:00]  Look at you.  I don't know what you're talking about.  There's your poobah, people.  He doesn't even want the truth to come out.  You were the one who suggested the three-month rule.  Nope.  Meaning guys only get it once every month.  I have the tape.  If you let the tape play, you will see that you suggested it.  Look at the time.  We got to go.  We got to go.  Fine.  I think enough information has gone out that the people can make up their own minds and  realize that they're poobah, Opie, Mr. One Week I Got a Hummer Ago.  Whatever.  One Week I Got a Hummer Ago. 
[01:02:30]  Whatever.  The hell am I saying?  Listen, man.  You know, Rick, destroy this tape.  I don't care.  I have more.  I have plenty.  Hey, I'm not falling for that one again where Rick smashes it.  Your puppet over there.  A puppet for the corporation.  Well, we obviously don't have time to play this tape, so I guess we'll have to play it  on a future Opie and Anthony show.  I'm in no rush.  The truth will come out.  All right.  We've heard enough already, Mr. Do Your Chores for a Hummer.  Come on, guys.  Earn those points. 
[01:03:00]  Was that ever what it was about?  Ugh.  Can I end the show as the grand poobah by congratulating all the new members of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club?  You make me sick.  And we'll, you know, congratulate the people that will become members later on tonight as  well.  Okay?  All right.  And this so-called tape, I guess we could let it ride on a future episode of the Opie and  Anthony show.  Right.  All right?  Right here in my bag.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow at three.  Is it true that the pork man is coming in tomorrow to sing Christmas songs? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, that's what I hear.  Pork delivery guy.  The guy that throws the menus under the door and drives the bicycle.  roars.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see. </pre>
