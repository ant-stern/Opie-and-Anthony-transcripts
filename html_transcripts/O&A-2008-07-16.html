<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' signature playful banter and quickly devolved into crude sexual humor.  They discussed the show's iPhone accessibility before turning to a critical review of the overly long Major League Baseball All-Star game, focusing on George Steinbrenner's frail appearance and speculating on his health.  The conversation then shifted to a glowing review of *The Dark Knight*, with Opie and guest Jimmy praising Heath Ledger's Joker performance above even Christian Bale's Batman.  They compared Ledger to Jack Nicholson's portrayal, commented on Gary Oldman's resemblance to Kreskin, criticized Morgan Freeman's typecasting, and recounted a chaotic post-movie cell phone retrieval incident. Opie also mentioned Maggie Gyllenhaal's appearance, prompting a listener to submit a picture of her breastfeeding.

The show revisited the All-Star game's conclusion and home-field advantage before Opie described his traffic woes due to a celebrity red carpet event. They dismissed negative *Dark Knight* reviews, speculating on a posthumous Oscar nomination for Ledger. A discussion about a friendship bracelet transitioned into pessimistic predictions about Barack Obama's presidency and its potential impact on minority voters.  A segment followed about police officers disciplined for intoxicated use of force. The show promoted the Opie and Anthony virus comedy tour, further discussed *The Dark Knight*, and speculated on a potential promotion for Jill Nicolini at CW11.  Sam, a staff member, was briefly interviewed, primarily about gossip involving his girlfriend and Seth Green.  Audio clips included audience opinions and Jill Nicolini's *Dark Knight* news report, which revealed she did at least speak to Aaron Eckhart.

The focus then shifted to Jill Nicolini and the authenticity of her alleged *Dark Knight* cast interviews, with a clip of her report played for verification.  The hosts debated whether she and Anthony were together at a screening and the likelihood of her promotion.  A significant portion of the broadcast detailed internal workplace conflict, with heated arguments between staff members (Travis, Danny, Steve, Eric, and Sam) over missed news items, particularly Pat O'Brien's marriage. Accusations of tardiness and inadequate work ethic were exchanged, alongside a side conversation about the hosts' upcoming pool party.  Studio guest Mike DiStefano discussed his experiences at an animation festival and a scam in Kalamazoo, while Mr. G, a New York City weatherman, made a brief appearance, touching Anthony despite his dislike of being touched. A caller discussed Bear Week in Provincetown, providing a website link.

The show ran late due to a staff issue, leading into a "Prime Time Gossip" segment about Sam's girlfriend, Jess, and her alleged crush on Seth Green, revealing Jess as a suspected pathological liar.  Promotional announcements for Mike D'Stefanoâ€™s Chicago shows were interspersed with banter about JFK Jr.'s death anniversary, *The Catcher in the Rye*, and the Apollo 11 moon landing.  A recurring bit involved producer Steve Carlisi avoiding naming a staff member he'd fire.  Roland provided a *Dark Knight* review focusing on Ledger, prompting discussion of Ledger's death.  A news story about a "World's Greatest Dad" arrested for soliciting a minor sparked a conversation about a Virgin Mobile campaign encouraging teenage girls to strip online for charity, leading to offensive jokes and suggestions for a similar listener-based campaign.  A lengthy discussion on a plane crash and faulty aircraft design followed, including calls from pilot listeners.  The show returned to the Virgin Mobile campaign and a detailed, graphic, and often offensive description of Bear Week in Provincetown, including commentary on numerous photos from the Big Muscle Bear website.

A substantial segment heavily featured graphic descriptions and jokes about Bear Week, with explicit details of events and attendees, employing crude and homophobic language.  A caller, Tim, a gay man from Dallas, voiced anger at stereotypical portrayals of gay men, explaining the negative impact on his adoption efforts. The hosts initially mocked him but later showed some sympathy.  "What's the Haps?" segments with Sam Roberts interviewing people at an All-Star parade were interspersed with further Bear Week photo commentary and jokes. A Batman montage played, followed by discussion of a Rampage Jackson hit-and-run and a final Bear Week recap. Jim Norton left unexpectedly for a cat scan, while Mike DeStefano was a guest during parts of the broadcast.  The show concluded with further promotions for Mike D'Stefano and the show itself.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the OP&Anthony Show.  OP&Anthony. Radio SHOCKJOT. OP&Anthony.  Radio Bad Boys, OP&Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities OP&Anthony.  Intimous DJs OP&Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts OP&Anthony.  OP&Anthony. Radio SHOCKJOT. OP&Anthony.  Alright, we get it!  Hey, how's it going?  It's going quick! 
[00:00:30]  Tor Johnson, bobbing from gonorrhea.  All right, this is a bust, lesbians.  We're gonna smell all of your fingers.  If it smells like a day at the fishing hole, you're under arrest.  We're blithering idiots.  That's fine, though.  I want more of my it-a-see. It-a-see.  It-a-see.  I love you guys. I'd suck all your c** all day.  Wow. 
[00:01:00]  Fine.  I think that's an endorsement.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Want to say good morning to everybody listening to us on their iPhones.  The future.  The future.  Ever since Anthony said that, you know, you can get our phone-  get our phone, oh my god, get our show on the iPhone.  I've been obsessed with this.  This new technology.  Yeah.  The future is here.  Yeah.  It's great. 
[00:01:30]  Listen to whatever stations you want that are available right now.  Of course, I'm sure more will be coming.  But, uh, it's so handy.  It really is.  Yeah.  So, yes.  Good morning.  Hello.  If you're listening on the little iPhone.  Just a quick hi.  Yeah.  To the people listening on the iPhone.  I was reading, uh, I don't know if it was a post, or an email, or an instant feed.  I don't know.  We got so many ways for our listeners to get ahold of us, but someone was saying that they 
[00:02:00]  were listening to KROQ, our flagship station where we're broadcasting from right now, as  they sat there in LA in their car.  Yep.  How cool is that?  Pretty, pretty damn cool.  And this just in, the BlackBerry is adding an, uh, an AOL app in the fall.  In the fall.  Oh, are they?  In the fall?  Well.  Hey, hey, you have that to look forward to.  I want to be on board with these apps.  With some apps. 
[00:02:30]  I'm still not app-ing with my BlackBerry.  You gotta app.  Yeah.  Download them.  You just look through your apps, see some new ones, and go, hey, can I use that?  Even if I can't screw it, it's free.  Yeah.  Put it on there, you never know.  Uh, by the way, we'll talk about the All-Star game in about three hours from now, because the  people that stayed up to watch the All-Star game are still sleeping.  They're sleeping.  Went very long.  Yeah, uh, the game ended at 1.23 in the morning.  That's a mere, what, four, four and a half hours ago. 
[00:03:00]  People have to work!  What is Major League Baseball thinking?  End it.  This isn't a Friday or Saturday night, it was a Tuesday night.  And you expect people to stay up till 1.23 in the morning.  There's no way to end that, though.  You can't just, like, call the game.  Dude, with all the pregame, and now we're gonna bring it out onto the field.  You mean the hoopla.  All the hoopla.  All the hoopla.  I hate that word. 
[00:03:30]  I'm an idea man, and I know Major League Baseball's listening.  It's very simple.  You start the hoopla, as Anthony said.  Yes.  Like four in the afternoon.  By the time the game starts, it'll be seven, seven o'clock.  And then people could, you know, get up and go to work the next day.  Yeah.  What are they thinking?  Why do they do it this way?  I was getting an email from, you know, the staff, and they're like, oh my God, 47 minutes,  and the game still hasn't started. 
[00:04:00]  They're still introducing people.  Oh, there's so much pomp and circumstance.  And then, ooh.  I'm trying to think of how many ways we could put this.  Hoopla.  Hoopla.  And the pomp.  Pomp and circumstance.  And then when you thought it was about to begin, then they wheeled George Steinbrenner  out.  More hullabaloo.  Georgie.  Oh, Georgie.  What happened? 
[00:04:30]  Good old Georgie.  Georgie.  We were making fun of him 10 years ago.  Almost 10 years ago.  10 years ago.  Yeah.  We were making fun of the way George Steinbrenner used to be the big boss.  He'd wear his crazy Eddie-looking turtlenecks and get out there and raise hell.  Yeah.  Firing people.  The legendary brawls between him and Billy Martin.  He was the tough guy.  George Steinbrenner was a tough son of a bitch. 
[00:05:00]  And now to see the shell of a man.  Sure.  Just constantly crying.  Yeah.  He's like me as a young boy.  Crying at everything.  They wheeled him out in a golf cart to deliver the baseballs.  Who did he deliver him to?  I don't know.  The game.  Who threw out the first pitches?  There was a bunch of them because that's what you have to do now. 
[00:05:30]  Remember the old days?  One pitch.  Thank you.  Get lost.  We've got to play some ball.  It's like when the president signs a bill or something.  He signs like part of his name with one pen and then the next pen and the next pen.  It takes 20 pens to sign your name.  That's got to be a skill because you ever try to write a check and like your pen dies out and now you pick up one new pen.  It's my name to be continued.  And then you try to continue your signature and you feel like you have, I don't know, cerebral palsy or something. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You can't really get the rhythm back.  You got to get that rhythm right from the first letter.  Well, this stupid Bush, he signs his name, what, with 20 different pens?  How do you do that?  Yeah, with 20 different pens and then they give the pen out.  Here's the one that was used.  No, it's one of 20.  And that's the same thing they do with like the first pitch now?  Sure.  Yeah, well, Steinbrenner delivered the balls and it's being acknowledged that certainly Yankee Stadium gave him respect. 
[00:06:30]  But it wasn't over the top.  Holy crap.  They're wheeling George Steinbrenner around the field in a golf cart.  Yeah.  Applause, you know.  But here's something very interesting.  George bought the Yankees in 1973 from CBS, this fine company we work for today.  CBS.  CBS owned the Yankees.  In 1973, George bought them for $10 million. 
[00:07:00]  $10 million.  They got to be worth, what, $12 million, $13 million by now.  At least they're worth more than $10 million.  Well, yeah, the Yankees are now worth $1.2 billion.  A billion.  CBS gave them up for a lousy $10 million back in 73.  That is a hell of an investment.  That's a fine investment.  Wow.  Don't go calling and talking about the economy and that baseball players made less, blah, 
[00:07:30]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's a hell of an investment.  Just Georgie.  Like Ian said.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Look at him.  When Mattingly made $19.5 million, that was a massive, almost obscene contract.  Yeah.  And he said, I'll never pay a player more than $20 million.  And I think that's what he gave him, $19.5 million.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that changed.  Oh, be so dumb, writes on instant feedback.  Oh, be so dumb.  The pregame started at five. 
[00:08:00]  The reason it went so long was because it went into extra innings.  I understand the game went into extra innings and it was 15 innings.  But the first pitch wasn't even thrown until close to nine o'clock.  That's the point I'm getting at.  Right.  If you were listening to me, dummy, I said that the game should start at seven.  You dunce.  877-212-ON-A.  So you got George Steinbrenner just crying like a little baby.  The last all-star game here at the stadium. 
[00:08:30]  Just a blubbering fool.  Did he talk at all?  I don't know.  No, he was just crying.  They showed him, though, in the little golf cart bouncing around in the golf cart.  Yeah.  And he just has this constant, wet lower lip.  Like he's drooling all the time or something.  I think there's a little something wrong with Georgie these days.  Yeah.  Are they saying what's wrong with him?  They've been able to keep that under wraps.  Could it be the old, you know, Alzheimer? 
[00:09:00]  Does he got an old owls?  Does he got a bit of owls?  How you doing, owls?  I think he might have a little of that, but, you know, I'm a doctor.  I'm diagnosing from a video of him in a golf cart.  Yeah.  Diagnosing him with Alzheimer's.  Dr. Anthony.  Yes, that's what he has.  I saw a video of him in a golf cart.  Well, he faded away fast, though.  Like there was something, you know, medically wrong with him and they decided not to tell  anybody.  Yeah.  I believe. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  That's kind of old.  Ah.  And then he's got his, uh, he's got his kids running the jerk now.  You think he was just kind of like, uh, remembering famous Yankee moments as, as they're around  the field.  That's what it is.  Maybe the emotion got to him that they're, you know, knocking the place down.  Yeah.  Talking about that's where Lou Gehrig's, you know, stood for his speech.  I remember.  Buh.  Yeah.  Oh, there's where Billy dropped an n-bomb screaming at Reggie.  And that's where Billy vomited down the steps.  And Sermon punched Reggie in the face. 
[00:10:00]  All the good memories.  I love those guys.  That's where Wade Boggs was on the horse backwards.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  That's where Jim Lairridge used to drink before driving home quickly in the on-deck circle.  Whoa.  Wow.  Wow.  Whoa.  She drinks and drives.  That's what Jimmy Lairridge does.  Of course.  A little bit, a little bit.  877-212-O-N-A.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Jimmy and I, and some other people. 
[00:10:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  And some other people went and saw Dark Knight last night.  And my God, is this a great movie.  Wow.  The reviews are in.  The movie doesn't need our help, obviously.  I mean, uh.  Getting five stars.  Five stars.  Four and a half stars.  I mean, this movie was ridiculous.  How good it was.  And it's Heath Ledger's movie.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  I'm not gonna give any spoilers away.  I promise.  You could, you could believe me today.  But I'll tell you this much. 
[00:11:00]  It's Heath Ledger's movie.  It's not even a Batman movie.  It should have been, it should be called The Joker.  Really?  Really?  Yes!  He was that damn good.  I can't, I'm, I was annoyed at how good he was.  It's by, it's the best superhero villain ever.  Really?  Ever.  The Joker was.  It was, I was, I was sickened.  Like, did I call myself an entertainer watching it?  I mean, it was that great.  It's like all the hype around him.  I'm like, there's no way it's gonna be that good.  Yeah.  He was so great.  Christian Bale, I like as Bruce Wayne, but I don't like him as Batman. 
[00:11:30]  No?  Eh, I'm Batman!  Well, they do, they do this with the voice.  Yeah.  They've always done that.  But really over the top.  Yeah.  To the point of...  He's gotta disguise his voice or people know he's Bruce Wayne.  We understand that.  We have to suspend disbelief.  I believe there's a man with a bat hat flying through a city.  Yeah.  I can believe that nobody recognizes his voice.  He drives the bat car with the wings and it has fire on it.  Yeah.  I can believe that.  Why, you're running? 
[00:12:00]  I can believe that.  Flop, flop, flop, flop, flop, flop, flop, flop.  Flop, flop, flop, flop.  Flop, flop, flop, flop, flop, flop, flop.  It's like Clint Eastwood Batman.  It drives me nuts.  Ah, I'm Batman.  That's all I want you to think when you're watching over, the fuck is Batman.  Okay.  I gotta tell you.  Jimmy, there was a person in between, Jimmy and I, and after the showing, everyone went their  own way, because I had to go get my dumb cell phone, because that's what I wanted  to do, was go to the Dark Knight premiere, or the day after premiere and take shots  shots for the internet of course these idiots so did you get any uh no to videotape it and they 
[00:12:30]  had a horrible system trying to get your cell phone back and there was almost a who thing that  happened because the escalator the really long escalator coming down from the imax theater yeah  it's like uber long was piling up at the bottom where that's where you got your cell phone so at  the end of the escalator and the table with your cell phones there was a mere 10 feet and they  thought this was smart and all of a sudden the people are starting to pile up at the bottom the  escalator and the escalator's filled there's no stopping them dude people start screaming go get 
[00:13:00]  out of the way losing it because it was literally seconds away from a disaster what kind of idiots  though get off and just stop there in front of well that's where the table was full even so dude  because everyone is about themselves they're like they have my cell phone this is where i get my  cell phone i'm not moving because then you're gonna then you're gonna uh then it's gonna take  you a long time to get your cell phone if you do the right thing and move out of the way dopey  uh system i guess horrible system and then i'm like i'm not getting trampled like i'm at a who 
[00:13:30]  concert so i literally pushed a few people over because i'm like screw this i'm not dying just because  i i wanted to enjoy the dark night and then it's amazing that nothing happened because people  were just piling piling piling and somehow they avoided a major disaster at the theater why don't  you just stick the cell phone down your groin you know if there's gonna be a metal detector  what you know what you didn't know if they're gonna metal detect you know what there's a difference  between jimmy and i they go do you have a cell phone i go yes i could have said no and i was i was i was i 
[00:14:00]  was good yeah they asked jimmy and he's like no no no i left it home no i said i said yes because i was  afraid they're going to search me and he goes okay uh you got to give it in and i had a camera that  can do video oh so you realized that you didn't have to give it in at that point i turned around  it was fiddling with the other people on the line it's not like airport security they're just asking  i am scrayed to the bathroom of course and i kept my phone between us now i don't want this to get out  but i kept my phone in my pocket yeah and i'm batman i'm here i'm here to be your batman meanwhile you 
[00:14:30]  know there's people like uh behind the screen and and in front of the uh crowd with um little  uh infrared detectors sure so they could see if someone's doing any uh yeah a little night vision  yeah they could see if people are taping it the imax by the way this movie is so well shot i had  problems with the very few i thought it was a great movie but i thought it was too long 
[00:15:00]  it double climaxed like you know some uh well that's the new thing the double climax  give you two unbelievable it feels good but it was yeah yeah the the who doesn't want to go a  second round horse they didn't need it it could have been in my top five favorite movies ever i  mean that's how much i loved it but it was still great but it was so well shot when you see it on  the imax you i i really was my palms were getting sweaty it was like i forgot how the imax makes you  feel like you're flying i mean it was it was an amazingly well shot movie yeah so i went and got my 
[00:15:30]  cell phone and jimmy left so we weren't able to talk and i called see at the end yeah it's all good  but i called him immediately i'm like holy crap how good was heath ledger in this damn movie  they basically turned the joker into a serial killer and that's not giving much away it really  isn't he's a sociopath amazing and i knew jimmy would love his uh his portrayal of the joker and  and then uh i was thinking as i'm leaving the theater i'm like now i miss heath ledger when he  died i'm like ah whatever an actor dying blah blah blah didn't see broke back never saw broke back 
[00:16:00]  mountain he did a good job in that and i'm thinking he's he was spit on his hand yeah but  i'm thinking he was a good actor i i acknowledged all that and whatever but it didn't really affect  me after you see dark knight you're like why is this guy dead why is this guy dead now i miss the  guy drugs yeah but he was just amazing why could they have shot two like oh can you imagine you wish  that they would have done uh two jokes there's no way you could have somebody else do it now because  like nicholson i was like how's he gonna fall you nicholson he blew nicholson away oh my it's not 
[00:16:30]  even close it's not even close nicholson's is like a parody of it absolutely he's the best absolutely  one of the best villains i mean that type of genre like ever i mean uh yeah you can't believe how  much you like watching him he's such a just he's his associate's a crazy but not like comic book crazy  like regular movie like real crazy crazy you would be scared of this person he's very cool yeah and  nicholson's now like an snl skit yeah his portrayal really yeah that's that's how you look at it now 
[00:17:00]  and then i i i uh i leaned over to jimmy at one point i'm going wow man they gave the amazing  kreskin about really big role in this movie  what's his what's his name looks just like the amazing kreskin who who oldman yeah gary oldman oh really  gary oldman get a picture of uh just google amazing kreskin before you see dark knight and  then you'll be laughing like i did inside the whole movie big glasses yes big dope yeah he looks 
[00:17:30]  like the amazing kreskin by the way gary oldman was great too i mean absolutely tremendous uh i'm  batman the lips curled up i'm bat hey callahan your breath your breath wash ain't making it  go ahead make my day i'm batman i love that that annoyed jimmy drove me wait till you see  clint batman eastwood yeah it was batman clint eastwood that was probably the only complaint in 
[00:18:00]  the entire movie except for maybe like jimmy said it being a little long i hate long movies i didn't  think it was long at all i was i was just loving every every minute of the movie not that it sucked  but the the the part that i liked like the hunk that i thought should have been the actual movie i felt  like uh there was just stuff around it that to me were unnecessary because right so it was such a  powerful and action-filled great and let's not forget morgan freeman i think at this point  whatever movie morgan freeman is they should just at the end in the credits they should say morgan  freeman as morgan freeman as because the guy morgan freeman always plays dude the guy plays the same 
[00:18:30]  exact character in every movie he ever does and they say he's a brilliant actor was he just kind of  the soft-spoken guy and always uh has the answer and hollywood should not very wise hollywood should  not even acknowledge that he's an actor they should they put him in movies but just say morgan  freeman as morgan freeman because that's what you're getting he's the same character he's not  needed in this movie at all um he's just not needed i mean it's like they could have had any actor do it 
[00:19:00]  yeah i hate him a lot less but it's named morgan freeman and uh what's her name gillenhall or gillenhall  uh maggie uh gillenhall she's ugly oh she looks like she looks like uh princess leia uh she it was  and she played uh katie holmes's part yeah um katie holmes was so much hotter than maggie and and they  didn't put katie holmes in this one because why would tom cruise allow her to do a movie and be more  famous than tom cruise what are you insane that's pretty much it huh yes that's exactly what that's 
[00:19:30]  all about scientology got her no that's exactly what that's about tom cruise needs his woman to  be you know on the sidelines not a big star in the dark knight movie that's totally what that's about  when she if she sees this movie she's probably want to smack his face unless she was pregnant she  might have been pregnant at the time they're filming oh oh oh maybe maybe do people think maggie uh  gillenhall is is hot gillenhall gillenhall gillenhall whatever i don't even know she's awful and her face  she's got like like old woman features in her face already she's only in her 20s like linda stassi 
[00:20:00]  that's odd like it must have been weird her and heath ledger because like heath ledger  went homo with her brother and broke back mount oh yeah interesting but uh just amazing people are  gonna love this movie and uh like i said it's heath ledger's movie simple as that from the opening  sequence it's like they don't bog you down with a lot of background garbage it gets right to it it's  so good man it is so rave reviews coming in from the opian anthony show yeah absolutely i was blown 
[00:20:30]  away by that two thumbs up yeah four two of his and two of mine all right i like uh maggie a little  more because uh we just google imaged her and there's a nice picture of her breastfeeding oh yeah  with with booby exposed look at that wow wow wow wee wow that is a hot picture  breastfeeding doesn't cut it for me that's kind of hot sorry can we put that on onaradio.com  it's breastfeeding are the lawyers gonna have a problem with a breastfeeding picture because i  i the listeners need to see that to to decide if it's hot or not that's kind of hot in a weird 
[00:21:00]  wow she's got a nice uh teardrop bosom oh yeah jimony cricket yeah kid knows stupid pink cyan batman  i wanted those too embarrassed to tell them stop with the scratchy voice we get it you don't be  recognized bruce all the acting was amazing except for the little boy at near the end  oh he was stupid oh oh it took you out of the movie for thank god only about 10 seconds 
[00:21:30]  seconds his acting was i'll just say this much it was just awful yeah just awful that over the top  kid acting hate that oh god hey mister that's exactly it oh is it okay that was pretty much it  i hate i don't want to give the line away because i promise i promise no spoilers today but but you  just nailed it without even seeing the movie yeah that is the over the top bad kid do you think  i'm batman jimmy's obsessed with that stupid curled up lip your breath wash ain't making it 
[00:22:00]  i'm a superhero are you there were scenes that he's ledger did where jimmy and i were both doing  the same thing just reacting and like making weird noises and stuff like holy crap how good was that  scene it's like when you watch i'm watching actors sometimes like you make these little weird character 
[00:22:30]  choices things that they don't tell you just that you do as a great actor and it was like god  it was like depressing to yeah i took a role that we all know everyone goes in knowing what the joker is  sure no one doesn't know the joker so we all we all start at the same place every actor every comic  every audience member knows what the joker is yeah with his dumb little riddles that's the riddler  oh whatever dumb little jokes yeah yeah the joker's got jokes yeah okay although i do think i would 
[00:23:00]  have been a better joker i would have made it a little funnier and more lighthearted jokey yeah told  some jokes nice ears batman and i would have run away while they were all laughing i gotta tell you this  too uh we have to put a time limit on this uh before we go away on our summer vacation so we'll  give the listeners a good two weeks and then we'll really discuss this movie because there was one scene  that uh i really want to discuss near the end the uh the two yeah yeah yeah yeah that was i wish i could 
[00:23:30]  say it now but no spoilers no spoilers i don't know what a record for our yeah but i mean what  we'll do is we'll give the listeners a week or two two weekends two weekends to see his movie then  we'll we'll have a nice discussion and we'll let you know we won't just spoil it no no absolutely  yeah all right you want to see it yeah when microphone iraq no friday you know that the imax uh  showings uh sold out for the next three weeks is that just in new york or or all over the country 
[00:24:00]  does anyone know i know at least in new york uh you can't even see uh the dark night on the imax  theater for at least three weeks sold out for the next three weeks aren't they doing 6 a.m  showing oh yeah they're just this movie is going to set ridiculous records it was i gotta be on that  imax man you really do uh roland and his uh and roland the second that his brother really saved uh  some good seats for us it was like you're in the middle of the imax and i didn't get up to pee 
[00:24:30]  once which is a miracle i had to we pretty much had the best seats in the house because of roland  and his creepy brother roger oh is that it you're there again yeah yeah roger's always there he's  omnipresent all right we'll go to the phones next 877-212-0&a it's opie and anthony  good morning to everybody opie and anthony jim norton so we just talked about the dark night right  and then we decide you know we got to go on rotten tomatoes and see what's going on  it's getting 89 positive reviews and then i'm thinking to myself who the hell is giving this 
[00:25:00]  movie a bad review really all the major papers giving it four or five stars four and a half stars  everyone is acknowledging that heath ledger might get an oscar for this uh for this movie  is it the too cool for the room people thank you anthony absolutely yeah you know the reviewer  that has to be the one like man look what i'm gonna do everyone's loving this movie so look what  i do the one he gives like five stars to is the movie no one's ever heard of right it's some movie out 
[00:25:30]  of bulgaria i hate that some movie with subtitles i've seen this movie it's magical yeah is it it's  called yeah so so let me just read a couple of these really fast uh this guy writes about dark  night now remember 89 positive reviews on uh rotten tomatoes sure visually impressive but any hack  can do a halfway decent job with the trailer ready tangents not everyone can push the genre forward 
[00:26:00]  and the fact that nolan's padded popcorn flick isn't the streamlined masterpiece it could have been  is a real buzzkill oh what a douche what an what a needing to sound informed yeah he knows this  ledger was masterful in this as i just read i didn't want it you think i don't want to come in  and trash her how much fun it would be yeah of course that's uh time out new york that was uh 
[00:26:30]  oh david fear of time out new york that's what he wrote and then here's another one another guy  that has to be the guy he writes this movie is too in love with itself to make you love it what  what does that even mean describing that's marshall fine he's usually a pretty good reviewer from star  magazine oh he got this one wrong and then you got this guy the dark night is noisy jumbled and 
[00:27:00]  sadistic oh that's david uh edelstein new york magazine what what would you expect from new  york magazine what would you expect me the next page iraq what would you expect it's it's a great  movie it really is a great movie sadistic shut up you can get picky if you really want to but  overall it's a it's an amazing amazing movie but that's why guys like that shouldn't be just  what a baby what are you reviewing a comic book movie for you're a baby uh you want me to uh here's 
[00:27:30]  another one all right this movie is grim and jammed together the narrative isn't shaped coherently  to bring out contrast and build toward a satisfying climax the dark night is constant climax it's always  in a frenzy and it goes on forever yeah i could almost go look i you know what i've said it many  times on this uh on this show i'm not a huge action movie guy this had a lot of action and i i didn't 
[00:28:00]  mind at all even though it was he was right about it was a constant climax and i think they should have  cut it they could have cut a half hour of the movie but half hour at least it's about two and a  half hours long so two and a half yeah but it could be 150 and i would have i would have been  one of my favorite movies ever there you go dave texas what's up hey what's up man first of all david  edelstein's a homo uh do you think the uh oscar rumors are true i gotta be honest he has to be 
[00:28:30]  nominated and as i was watching him i kept thinking should this guy get an oscar and what he did with  that was so he made that character so interesting and and all you wanted to do was learn more about him  like why is he liked it i absolutely yeah yeah i do think so and i thought i was congratulating  themselves idiots who worked with him you know his posthumous oscar nod should he get a posthumous  oscar nod i think posthumous oscar is possible but god damn it he was he really uh i would like 
[00:29:00]  to see him win it i mean i haven't seen obviously other whoever else they usually give the oscar to  somebody else that's living because they don't want the oscar just sitting in a empty room somewhere  yeah where's it gonna by itself who's gonna come and get it i would like to accept this word for  heath i know that he would well love to blah blah there's a lot of crying oscar night as someone  accepts the award for him and then it ends up in a box in an empty room somewhere yeah it's a waste of  an oscar but who else to get an oscar for like a for playing a batman villain yeah how good of a job 
[00:29:30]  you have to do so i mean christian bell has to want to shoot himself because literally no one's talking  about his performance just because heath was that good they're gonna sell versions without him in  it because you get to i'm batman i love jimmy's impression it drives me i can't wait to see it  now i'm just gonna be laughing every time he does that watch the way his lip curls up but as bruce  wayne he's great he's like a really good actor but it's like well as bruce wayne he's kind of like  the american psycho character yeah very polished and very you know i'd like a reservation at dorsia 
[00:30:00]  yeah there's one scene and this is pretty much in the trailers and this is uh this is how just  vicious this is where with it where a batman is headed towards the joker he's riding on his  motorcycle towards him and he's just kind of standing there with that with the was holding  the pistol the joker and he's just like come on come on do it come on do it like and he's just rooting  for him and he's so good really just standing there you're just like this is a great movie like i 
[00:30:30]  might have been the director who told him how to stand but he's just standing there waiting to  get run down and you're like i love this guy begging to be run down yeah it was oh i i will  go i will go see this movie again i never see a movie a second time just because i want to see  heath ledger again as the joker they could have done a whole like spin-off movie uh with the back  history of the joker easily i'll bet you that there's some stuff that they left on the uh out  because uh they had to know that for dvd extras uh deleted heath ledger scenes and 
[00:31:00]  anything he did you're going to want to see yeah yeah so i i mean all right the dvd is coming out  soon let's move on to other things uh just in case you weren't up at 1 23 in the morning  this is what happened 3-3 in the bottom of the 15th inning michael young pops it up right field  cory hart morno tags at third here we go throw by hart to the plate and save this game is over 
[00:31:30]  morno scores terry francona exhales and the american league has won again and they will have  home field advantage in the upcoming world series i thought mr buck at the end of that was going to  go and no one cares everyone's asleep yeah so they can roll up the dumb red carpet now finally  the uh red carpet that uh was for 18 blocks here in new york city yesterday just messing up  everything tying up traffic and did he get on the other side of the red carpet so he could get out 
[00:32:00]  of manhattan yeah jesus almost no yeah yeah i got a call you know from poe uh anthony i'm uh stuck in  traffic like well that's kind of why i needed you to leave early you know and and if you want to  listen yesterday because the red carpet anthony to get his car on the other side so east side of  sixth avenue that's where i needed it he'll get master poe to get his car on the other side of 
[00:32:30]  the red carpet but and then i'll walk over there uh and then get in my car and i'll be on the other  side of the mayhem yeah and uh you know get to the uh bridge and you gave him plenty of time to do that  but yeah but i don't know what happened and then i'm just here and uh hold on hold on i'm on the  phone with them hold on i go where are you exactly i'm at 55th and like eighth like why  and then i hear him go officer officer can i make a right turn oh they're not making letting me make 
[00:33:00]  a turn like that's why i needed this done at like 10 30 he is as dumb as they come man i can't hold  back anymore he is as dumb as they come oh he's good with his hands absolutely he's great with his  hands as long as there's not a pen in them as long as there's not a pen in them  oh god good gravy yeah did anyone see the uh the red carpet parade yeah i did what was that about 
[00:33:30]  their stunt brain stunt brain saw it fox uh taped the whole thing yesterday the parade happened at  about one o'clock and they had this parade special before the all-star game from like six to eight  o'clock and it was just old players sitting in the back of trucks and some of the new players with  their kids getting yelled at by the yankee fans but it was kind of cool except for the um spike lee  was an absolute jackass really that's a surprise wow he's usually uh usually such a nice guy they 
[00:34:00]  brought him out and he was about to be interviewed and hank aaron's car came by and instead of talking  to the people who were talking to him he kept going hey hank hank jesse hank during the whole  interview of course they finally just said go have some fun yeah get lost but and why why are they in  the back of pickup trucks it's a red carpet you're supposed to walk the red carpet i think so the  trucks were going slow enough where you could walk alongside it yeah but it was real hot and i don't 
[00:34:30]  think yogi was going to make it three oh god you mean yoda yeah there were a lot of very old guys  yeah oh that was worth uh snarling traffic for the day yesterday huh and in the background of every  shot were balloons or posters for the new fox show fringe oh so it was in every single shot  really promoting the fall season well fringe is going to be uh pretty hot show they're saying it's  that jj abrams thing right yep but i think sam was down there well let's get sam in here because

[00:38:30]  idiot the outlaw josey batman he really irritated me well brooklyn ace thanks for the observation we  appreciate that hey what are we done to 76 days opie yeah well what when is october 1st this is a real  thing happening by the way we're kind of i know it is we're making fun of it but the reality is we  have 76 days left in our contract and no one's talking hey listen how many days don't feel bad 
[00:39:00]  the cwa has uh 17 days left in our contract and it looks like we're going out boy yeah times they  are a change and this whole business is getting getting different as it uh as it moves the phones  and all this other stuff so who knows what's going to happen later guys 77 days i just was told all  right but i'll tell you this i don't care what kind of ipod you have you're not going to get what's the  haps on it all right so uh what's the haps there sam yeah let's play one or two of these before we  take a break okay you're at the uh the all-star parade with the the red carpet yeah they closed 
[00:39:30]  down the city all these people were around so i figured i'd go down to find out what's the haps  all right uh we meet louie a yankee fan yeah well all right so we're here outside the baseball parade  with louie louie what's the haps what's the haps like what's happening what's the haps right now really  he's waiting for the parade to start marching up this way who are you looking forward to seeing today  all-star jeter jambi i don't know what else be there are you a yankee fan or a mets fan 
[00:40:00]  new york but yankees are you uh are you upset that they're building a new yankee stadium it's time  for a change sometimes yeah so i figure after the electricity that he delivered with that one yeah  smart i asked him about what he's doing uh as far as voting for the election goes all right  have you heard about the controversy with the uh obamas on the cover of new yorker magazine 
[00:40:30]  yeah i saw it what do you think of that cover they try to knock them down  are you voting for obama yeah how come the change what kind of change are you looking for  but different all right great well thanks a lot  a lot of change what kind different different change as opposed to the same old change right  so the people know who they're voting for and why they're voting for him yeah i've been thinking 
[00:41:00]  about this obama thing a lot lately and i think there's gonna be a lot of disappointed people out  there including anthony obviously there's a little review i guess happening uh right there jill's doing  her review you guys could have went to the movie with us last night well did she even see the movie  anthony um why would i say anything like that she's doing the entertainment report are you trying  to say that jill nicolini's doing a review on dark night and she didn't see the movie she's probably  not doing a review jill nicolini audio she's probably not doing a review she's probably just talking about 
[00:41:30]  it oh see there's an interview with that guy wow she's just like you she doesn't prepare for her show  either hey i i prepare she's on tv doing a dark night review and i know she didn't see the movie  because you guys were you she's talking about it you guys were invited to see the movie with us  no get me this audio sam she's just talking about uh and look they got they got the people from the  movie yeah talking about the movie that's all you need and they're making believe that jill's 
[00:42:00]  talking to christian bell but uh that's not happening either no no they're not i don't  think they're trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes here she's just doing the entertainment uh  this cw 11 this morning quite hacky they know it's it's fantastic they're doing a great job  that scene was amazing as you said there's a party scene where he ledger walks in yeah oh  i gotta see this he does look fantastically bad just ridiculous all right he's just he was 
[00:42:30]  completely although again i would have done it in a different voice yeah i would have said the  batman joker here some comedian i don't know who it was it's about how all the superheroes he's a jewish  comedian how all the superheroes were jews in his face i forget but he's like my favorites are batman  spiderman oh speederman superman superman um so it's obama thing anthony's gonna be very  disappointed when obama's the president that's fair to say right uh yeah i'm not an obama supporter 
[00:43:00]  no i think i think um i think a lot of people are going to be disappointed when obama's president  like a lot of the minorities that are are voting for obama just because he's black uh-huh because  they're gonna they're they're voting for obama thing and the whole country's gonna change and it's  gonna it's gonna turn more their way right and they're gonna find out after the first hundred  days it's gonna be same old same old i'm telling you and there's that's who's gonna be really  disappointed in the end not whitey it's gonna be all the people that voted for obama thinking 
[00:43:30]  that he's gonna make real change because he's the first black president i don't know i think we're  gonna see uh and it all depends you know well i think we're gonna see a lot of uh liberal um  none of it's gonna get through a lot why not just because the system was a place my friend  maybe with a democratic uh congress maybe just a slight lean to hops a slightly with a democratic  congress what then what are you gonna do it's a machine my friend the machine is but but they'll 
[00:44:00]  sign off on whatever he says and and uh the the republicans won't have uh anything to say about  it so we'll end up like um how that happened with jimmy carter democratic uh congress and  democratic president yeah right that went out well that went well didn't it you know what america was  pretty much castrated uh for the entire time he was in office one guy uh the economy sucked  yeah but one guy doesn't have that power anymore one guy doesn't but one guy and a congress behind 
[00:44:30]  him does that'll give you a little bit of a lean well who's gonna say no to his policies then  yeah but they they mumbo jumbo the policies they throw a lot of other things in there that confuse  everything that's when you have a republican and a democratic congress or you have a democratic uh  president and a republican congress when you have a congress that backs up the president like that  then it's carte blanche you're talking about a guy that could put these very liberal policies in place  that are going to uh uh take away uh some of our rights that yeah tax increases you're gonna see a lot 
[00:45:00]  of tax increases you're gonna see things like the second amendment uh suffer uh terribly not terribly  terribly not terribly yes no you don't you you haven't kept track of of uh the second amendment  and how it's been trotted upon how many uh democrats how many guns you got i don't know i i can't count  all right let's say you have uh 15 uh-huh let's just say been through your house once or twice sure 
[00:45:30]  that's my guess yeah so maybe you can only have 14 that sucks i should be able to have as many guns as  i goddamn well please and whatever types i want i understand you know you got to put limitations i  can't have machine guns i did that on purpose by the way but no i know i knew that yeah but like that  whole assault weapons ban that there was yeah for a while there you know it was ridiculous it was  nothing but semantics uh an assault weapon is um defined purely on the look of the weapon 
[00:46:00]  what it looks like does it have a flash suppressor on the muzzle oh what is what is that going to do  i think uh more importantly i think it was in the paper today cops can't really shoot if they've had a  few holy jesus this story is just you know something good because the cops are getting to 
[00:46:30]  the point where they're just saying screw it they're put they're they're giving cops such a  hard time that they are going to see crimes when they're off duty and say you know something i ain't  bothering with this i'm just going to get in trouble so here's go go screw yourself here's the  scenario all hell is breaking loose a cop happens to be off duty he had one or two off duty he blew a  point oh nine now point oh eight is uh uh legal for uh illegal for driving just that's that's the 
[00:47:00]  limit so he uh blows a point oh nine but he had shot a perp this guy had a tech nine he fired three  shots at the cop the cop draws on him shoots him and injures him doesn't kill him so it sounds like it  went down perfectly they and ever since the friggin uh bell shooting uh the commissioners decided that  anytime there's a shooting the cops have to take a breathalyzer test so he took a breathalyzer he 
[00:47:30]  blows the uh point oh nine uh he's now on restricted uh you know desk duty they took his gun away  and uh this guy pretty much was a hero he's off duty it sounds like he's a guy shooting a guy is  shooting at him and he's supposed to they told him you're supposed to call 911 he's a cop it was  textbook too yeah how he took care of the situation no innocent uh bystanders were hit he uh injured the  the the bad guy and he gets chastised for it you know something i don't blame any cop who's off duty 
[00:48:00]  that looks at a crime going on and walks the f away just leave the situation because you're just  going to get yourself in trouble and uh get yourself uh uh screwed you're right and that's  what they're going to do with stuff like this that's precedent you you see uh uh a cop reads  something like this sees his buddy get jammed up and what does he do now you got to look and assess the 
[00:48:30]  situation and go well should i pull my gun out should i try to apprehend this guy should i  intervene in any way no i'm not going to lose my job and my pension and everything else  it's an embarrassment it's an embarrassment yeah new rule they have to call 911 i can understand  unbelievable if somebody's falling down drunk and starts firing in the air there's a problem  but this guy yeah he's out he's off duty he's blown off some steam he's not uh uh intoxicated 
[00:49:00]  and uh he he gets a criminal shouldn't be case by case of course instead of this whole well no it's  so easy to just put a blanket over something over everything all right listen we got to take a  break we can continue with this after the break uh certainly 877-212-ON-A let's not forget uh what  are we two weeks out from the on a traveling virus we're terrible promoting wow we got two weeks we're  only doing one show this year it's going to be a great one it's august 2nd pnc bank art center

[00:54:00]  have it during vacation you know everyone's making vacation plans but but it's not like  it's at the end of it oh well it's uh the 16th can i go of course you don't want me at your pool  party i do yeah why don't you want us at your pool i do everybody's invited but you're you want to  make a duty in my pool i do don't make a duty i want nothing more than to get out and just giggle  and point to the middle of the pool and have you go get your stupid net get the net boy to drain the  no that would be keith the cop's job keith go get the net pronto get the net yes all right oh 
[00:54:30]  pool party news so you uh you didn't go see dark night uh you and jill no but what what's weird is  uh we're watching this uh this this local news channel yes cw11 and and they uh they stepped her up  today she should be the entertainment reporter this emily francis here in new york stinks jill  nicolini should be the entertainment reporter i know you can't comment because you you socialize 
[00:55:00]  with these people bias but you know what she's fantastic as the entertainment reporter of course  but uh jill you know the traffic vixen thing she's she's outgrown that it's so obvious she needs to be  the entertainment reporter she's very bubbly and she she knows how to conduct uh an interview  i was hoping she knows what she's doing over there i was hoping she would do mine when i  i was promoting happy endings i did cw11 i was actually hoping it would be jill it was uh emily  who was nice but she wouldn't say the name of the book like jill i think is is is more is is better 
[00:55:30]  for that i think she's like like she doesn't mind being a little sillier she's right yeah not worried  like oh my god my image she doesn't take herself that seriously exactly so when are they going to  tell emily francis to beat it so you're so your chick gets the big promotion i don't work there i don't  run the joint and i my my opinions are very biased are you secretly hoping though that they say beat  it's stupid i'm not saying anything it's it's a hard career you heard it here first anthony is  i did not sam did you hear that yeah i did don't you get anybody in trouble over there  look how paranoid he gets aunt's pool party oh you put it in your little calendar i put it in the 
[00:56:00]  iCal oh is that one of the apps no the apps or the other things i'll probably bring like i'll play  scrabble i'm gonna gather everyone around the pool we're gonna play like a big scrabble  scrabble everyone will have fun nice so jill is filling in for emily francis who uh  according anthony's gonna be fired soon so jill i didn't say anything like that i wanted to clear  that i never said that you're gonna get me in trouble with these people you have to socialize 
[00:56:30]  with them i understand i don't have to have to it's just it's uh you know it's what it is i don't  have to like socialize with these alcoholics that are doing the news  jeez but you do i understand and i really do yeah all right uh so uh jill did not see dark night  but uh she's talking about it today on uh tv well entertainment reporters have to report on  entertainment and and that movie it falls into that category doesn't it who's influencing who at 
[00:57:00]  this point in this relationship should she have seen dark night last night if she's going to talk  about it today on the cw no you get some details you play some uh clips and uh you're doing it  all right let's take a listen now remember jill did not see the movie right aunt i don't know  you're with her 24 hours a day at this point i don't know i'm trying to think maybe  no because um you know something i wasn't uh i wasn't with her the night yesterday but the day before 
[00:57:30]  right so perhaps she went to the movies yeah but you're in constant contact the iphone is always  there's communications going on you guys can't even wait till after your your your jobs to talk  so i'm assuming somewhere in the pinging that she's uh giving you a little review on dark night  what did she say about dark night what did what me and jimmy did our review today and i think uh we did  a fantastic review without giving out spoilers so what did jill say about dark night well if she had 
[00:58:00]  seen it she wasn't going to spoil it for me so she had to say something no no no i don't like  spoilers but i mean what did she comment on the performance at all yeah what does she think of  heath ledger she thinking oscar nod too like uh jimmy and i oh oscar nod i well um look i'm trying to  get her the entertainment job at this cw when they kick emily francis out the out the door no they're not 
[00:58:30]  kicking anyone out the door so let's get jill on the phone today i i gotta give her a little uh a  little help today she's got to see these things before she goes on tv and then she's gonna have  the job i'm telling you steve just walked in and he's trying to like he paced yes oscar nod i'll get  him on the phone oscar nod is that k-n-o-d i'm looking in the phone book he's in a bear panic today  he's just panicking all over the place because uh we had to give the guys a talking to today because  pat o'brien is marrying betsy the famous betsy betsy from his uh tapes so i go to steve like any 
[00:59:00]  second there's gonna be a cd in front of me with the famous pat o'brien betsy clips right or are you  gonna run into the office and get it done now anyway here's uh jill talking about the uh dark  night anthony a movie that she might have seen all right let's give a little listen look let's be  honest no one likes emily and they're gonna move jill up very soon that's not true oh my god that's  not even why what are you see stunt brains excited for your girl she's great yeah you know look i know 
[00:59:30]  she's fantastic and uh whatever she does she lights up when she does entertainment i sure does  very good she sure does and she's well prepared she's seen the movie all that stuff well yeah you  know here's jill nicolini talking about dark night a mere few minutes ago on the cw the dark night is  one of the most anticipated films of the summer but when we sat down with the cast what was on 
[01:00:00]  everyone's mind with the passing of heath ledger whose performance in this film is already receiving  critical acclaim all right all right there was nothing in there about seeing the movie okay nothing  in there about seeing the movie but she sat down with the stars what did she tell you about christian  bell she said when we sat down we meaning her it's the collective is there we as in the whole news  organization media and so it's whoever did sit down is there a clever ruse going on here i i don't i 
[01:00:30]  don't know what did jill nicolini talk to christian bell i uh did jill nicolini talk to maggie what  gillenhall gillenhall gillenhall i don't know morgan freeman she must have a nice cute little story  about morgan freeman when the cameras were off i don't know when did she hang out with the dark  night cast in between all the party and you said we now the we means someone in the news organization 
[01:01:00]  there in the church possibly what about gary smug guy what did gary all been saying about uh working  with heath ledger i don't know i i have not interviewed any of these people but she did and  you guys talk a little that pillow talk she must have said something uh what did they fly her out to  la how was that no no uh yeah that does actually look like they did the interviews in in the cw it  certainly looks like jill talked to the stars of the dark night give us a little inside scoop and 
[01:01:30]  please i something different this is what the listeners are are clamoring for perhaps if she did  i did not hear about it we were discussing other things i guess it didn't come up did she get your  american psycho dvd signed oh that's a good question you love american psycho and if she's gonna see  christian bale and do a little interview of course she's gonna do the right thing and get  things signed i don't think it's that professional to be asking for signatures at a television news  organization like that maybe she has as a surprise for you yeah all right let's uh let's got a 
[01:02:00]  friendship bracelet for me homo at the maybe at the pool party she'll break it out august 16th pool party  late jimmy bash wink all right let's uh let's uh let's uh let's listen to jill nicolini's exclusive  interviews with the cast of the dark night that she did i don't know in the middle of the night when  anthony was sleeping because that's the only time they're not in constant contact yes stunt brain i i think 
[01:02:30]  steve either is getting oscar nod on the phone or jill so you can ask her yourself oh steve's giving you  the finger oh what's that about steve oscar nod oh look at him and he's not even smiling he ain't  having it today there's a lot of nods in the phone book that's right yeah i think he's got  chilled though is that with one d or two all right hold on here's uh here's uh more uh  his performance in this film is already receiving critical acclaim 
[01:03:00]  bruce this is harvey dent the famous bruce wayne rachel's told me everything about you  i certainly hope not christian bale is back as the caped crusader some new faces join him in the  fight to restore gotham city including maggie gyllenhaal and aaron eckhart who plays two-face  i always dressed up as batman and watched batman and uh you know had all the the paraphernalia and all  that sort of stuff to see batman while i was acting on a rooftop for the first time um was 
[01:03:30]  i have to say quite an emotional experience for so i don't know the actor's name but uh he plays  harvey dent and thank you in dark night and he was also terrific in uh uh no smoking thank you for  smoking thank you for not smoking or no thank you for smoking which was a great movie that no one saw  anyway it sounds like jill talked to this guy no it's it's just kind of a set it up and next thing  you know he's talking she didn't ask a question she didn't say hey blah blah blah blah question 
[01:04:00]  question and then have that injected in as as an answer by the way your girl also just gave a spoiler  yes she did really a massive spoiler and that's all i'm gonna say yes she did oh no really yes so not  only did she not see the movie she's now wrecking it for everybody that wants to see the movie was  the spoiler i'm not gonna say rooftop allegedly this movie had no roofs in it hey by the way how 
[01:04:30]  come no one's criticizing aaron eckhart i get killed for the dress on the dress how about him  well i played batman when i saw batman i was growing up i saw batman how many times you can say  batman we get it idiots you're in batman i'm batman please tell me they have a batman clip  and starring as clinty's toward we know we've heard batman i'm batman i'm batman more more  exclusive jill nicolini here i just remember as you listen to this clip that uh last night when we  saw the movie there was an empty seat where anthony should have been an empty seat where jill should 
[01:05:00]  have been well i kept nudging it and it was empty space but she knows all about the movie so she  obviously got uh one of those very rare screen she's very good at researching and she works very  hard at it she does her our homework all right along with a few new faces comes some new gadgets  and even a new bat suit like oh did she tell you about the gadgets that were in the movie because  they were really cool um what did she tell you about the guy no why not well she wanted you to be 
[01:05:30]  surprised because you're a gadget fan yeah yeah yeah yeah why would i need to know i want to see  him in the movie even a new bat suit i could move so much better hence why i was doing all my own  fight sequences you know because it wasn't as tiring you went fighting against the suit every single  second the bat pod that damn thing was near impossible to ride you can't ride something like 
[01:06:00]  that like you ride a regular motorbike because you slot to a certain degree and after a while you just  you you you you've fallen over and everybody did that i gotta tell you i'm really jealous i would  have loved to interview christian bale like jill nicolini did she even say she was interviewing  christian bale this is typical this is what what what they do in the news hey i'm what i'm like  everyone else i'm just a dummy that watches the local news if i see jill nicolini talking about dark  night and setting up a christian bale clip you gotta assume that she was actually there in the room with 
[01:06:30]  the guy he did american psycho he did the machinist he did he did uh the good the bad and the ugly  he did dirty harry he did the enforcer get it joker joker make my day no no it she she what she  she what she was she was kind of just talking about the movie yeah and then uh letting the stars of the  movie elaborate on certain aspects of the movie sure but not trying to bamboozle anyone into thinking 
[01:07:00]  she was doing the interviews well bill's gonna help you out uh bill from waterford writes jill is  too busy watching the dark night in ants pants so uh hey hey now can i say that uh there wasn't she  because christian bale mentioned the motorcycle can i say that watching him on that motorcycle  with his dumb cape going behind him was badass oh wow really it was bad you can't he made a cape  look cool he really did man if you just try to walk around new york in a cape people will i have 
[01:07:30]  laugh at you oh yes how did that work out for you i told people i'm here to rescue you  oh see look who's on the phone yes all right hold on one second let me get uh oh she probably  doesn't have much time of course not very busy girl ladies and gentlemen one half of uh the  anthelini power couple jill nicolini from uh the cw 11 here in new york jill jill we're all we're all  very jealous that uh not only did you see the dark night you got to interview the stars of the movie 
[01:08:00]  we just played your clip of you talking to christian bell oh yeah i'm sorry anthony i forgot to invite you  to the premiere the other night i that's okay yeah see she said oh the screening you guys they  went to the screening she goes the premiere was last night see yeah but you already admitted that  you two were together on premiere night no actually no i told them i was sleeping but i really had to  go to the premiere i didn't want to make him jealous see i'm in there that could happen so what did 
[01:08:30]  you tell anthony about the movie that you got to see oh i am kidding let's let's let's give you a  little tv 101 okay let me give you some tips here you watched the package of me obviously talking  about the dark night now you didn't see any shots of me sitting across from christian bell right but  you're not supposed to admit this oh guess what ever guess what tv 101 ever no it's okay it's okay  so there were technically no two shots or over the shoulder shots from christian so you didn't see me 
[01:09:00]  so that probably means i wasn't really there and didn't do the interview a lot of those interviews  are done oh why is she pulling out the spot i think i just i think i just saw you on the phone by the  way what i think i just saw you on the phone on the wide shot of course you did this this this hacky  local news hysterical hey jill let me ask you when they do those shots uh now i'm gonna ask a real  news question because obviously they do them at these junkets do they actually will they just show  the same interview on a bunch of networks or is there somebody like actually sitting there are 
[01:09:30]  they just pretty much filming the guy talking with with the backdrop well sometimes they're  standard interviews like that people get the same material but most of the time there's satellite  interviews so what happens is each station gets about five minutes with the actors and you talk to  them via satellite and um so everyone kind of gets their own material but yeah when in doubt with  the movies with cheaper budget yeah you get stock footage and stock answers and interviews okay  yeah it's hard to get like christian bale to do 500 interviews around the country yeah it's tiring 
[01:10:00]  jill does she does her research she works very hard and i think she does a great job why thank you  darling but i heard i heard you guys went to see the um movie last night and you didn't invite anthony  and i and now now you're just now you're just doing a radio bit you guys were you guys were invited  you yeah i asked you last night how come we weren't invited and what did you say anthony  i said uh we weren't invited you're a liar you know that we invited you don't now we got to get 
[01:10:30]  rolling on the phone because now you're going to piss off rolling and you don't want to piss him off  no he's very angry and his brother is even more insane of course not i said i don't want to go  because driving into the city and back out at that hour is crazy honey i live right there and also  for the record opie did he ask you to go to the mets game with us sunday night we had great tickets  like the tv tickets the field seats the box all right i'm i'm i'm you know how you just like gave  away a lot of stuff for tv i'm gonna give a lot of stuff uh away for radio aunt and i aren't really 
[01:11:00]  friends hey come on so why would he why would he invite invite me to the mets game on sunday i would  love to go i'm not a mets fan but i love it would be great i could bond more with lindsey and the four  of us hang out and we've had this clever ruse going on for many years but it's time to admit  that we're not actually friends but see a friend would invite you to the to shea stadium uh knowing  that that the guy you've been doing radio for uh with for 14 years is a huge mets fan i'll let 
[01:11:30]  myself off the hook here it was very late uh on sunday it was a night game on sunday impossible to  make impossible to make well let me make that decision hey don't you have to go yeah me no not yet i  have a few more minutes hey hey jill by the way uh we're rooting for you we know that they're going  to kick emily to the curb soon and you're going to be the entertainment reporter and that's where  you should be sitting every morning oh well thank you very much i know you're bored of doing the  traffic you're still doing an unbelievable job and it's time that they do the right thing and kick

[01:18:00]  in the dirt in the back of cars so ladies if you feel like it that guy's looking for some boobs  uh as he drives around town today you got a little flash yeah we got drama going on here in the  studio i don't wave it off it's a radio show who is waving it off travis waving it off what heterosexuality  the only reason people listen to this radio show is because they're convinced there will be a fist  fight and they don't want to miss the fist fight right or they want to know what it's about the 
[01:18:30]  controversy there travis we also got to say hello to mike di stefano which we'll do we know mike is here  mike well really fast mike di stefano really funny guy we'll get into a mike in a second he's playing  uh july 25th and saturday july 26th at the lakeshore theater in chicago illinois lakeshore  theater.com spelled t-r-e theater that's right that'll be easier than giving out the uh the phone  number lakeshore theater.com travis what is going on yeah you're normally not that upset well no it's 
[01:19:00]  just we had something happen uh this morning where something got missed you could talk in  specifics yeah uh pat o'brien's getting married and uh we didn't see that and apparently it was  only on people.com it was a people.com exclusive oh so but uh before the before we just came back  before you just casually say that people.com is a pretty huge website if you want to like you know  be on top of entertainment i all right i agree okay admittedly i don't check people.com steve 
[01:19:30]  tells me uh from now on you have to check people.com every morning and i said can we just have an intern  do it make sure we're not missing anything and he said no you do it and i said i'm in at 4 15 every  morning already doing almost like an hour and a half worth of show prep i don't have time like i'm  you see me i run in here at three minutes before the show starts to to give you guys everything  that i have and you know i'm just steve i i think it could be delegated differently because steve was 
[01:20:00]  even very upset there was there was honest tension we didn't hear what was going on uh i told him yeah  he was just the travis was just the first one that got told i'm gonna tell everybody that now we have  one more website to check i don't want to hear no fair enough that's it fair enough sir i don't want  to hear no if i'm getting pistol whipped on the air for any number of reasons that uh yeah exactly  thank you uh verbally i meant uh then that crap is going to roll downhill well listen danny's got 
[01:20:30]  some objection too i love all this this behind the scenes stuff nobody see what's going on dan  oh no what bring danny into the mix why did danny's got an opinion i want to know of course he does  hold on this he doesn't want to hear this all started because um instant feedback was all over as  soon as we got here um that pat o'brien is gonna marry the famous betsy from those not horrific what  am i saying those sexy sexy tapes those sexy tapes that we can't play over here because the the f word 
[01:21:00]  is so prevalent that we we can't get it on the air me you betsy some drugs hookers yeah that's the  one he was uh had that big uh that dirty talk with and he's marrying her yeah he was oh my god what a  keeper he was like you me betsy god so betsy from the famous phone calls that's uh gonna be pat  o'brien's wife officially not the one he called but the one the girlfriend he was referring to yeah yeah  and you want to talk about running a bit into the ground we did probably three weeks on the pat 
[01:21:30]  o'brien tapes on our show three weeks we did a great job we did all the remixes it was it was  well known in the event it really was and i think honestly i'll say that we were probably the first  show to play it because uh at the time we were uh we were completely i mean it was literally the day  it broke we were in the morning show we were on xm on sensor we were one of the only shows that could  do it that would play it and we we were one of the first we did a great job so now you fast forward and  now betsy is uh marrying pat o'brien i stupid me i'm thinking well maybe we should have some audio clips 
[01:22:00]  of uh pat o'brien getting all dirty on the phone from back in the day no one had it so  i got mad at steve and i knew steve was catching something so i came out of the bathroom and the  way it works is you'll see steve where mike is standing you can't see it's across from me it's  on opie's right over the console and steve has got his hat on backwards he's going no no i know i have  to you know he's just i always know when steve's getting a scolding because i'll walk in he's just  kind of like okay yes yeah yeah pad o'brien with a question mark what's that he'll just write like  keywords down in his book with like little question marks like i noticed that during the uh he's writing 
[01:22:30]  right now danny uh-oh but don't worry we don't kick danny's ass but no what's no what's great  about this danny that's a good way to combat words yes it is sometimes violence is the answer you have  the immunity idol right now you really do since it's on the air yeah and everything goes we made  it where danny could speak openly on the air yeah speak openly off the air and here's another thing  that's in your favor danny we don't have a boss at cbs and we don't have a boss at xm at this point 
[01:23:00]  so there's not even a person around to fire you you'll never get fired find a way though huh  you get fired speaking your mind on the air never anymore no that's why we never wanted uh on air  to suffer because some people uh yeah and i got frustrated because i go steve why didn't we have  this and steve's answer was idontreadpeople.com which just threw me into a tizzy and then so then  because steve got yelled at he had to go yell at you guys that's how it works so who do you guys 
[01:23:30]  end up yelling at the janitor or the interns does cream pie jones get a beating for this eventually  does it come down to cream pie jones getting a talking to no what happens is what happened  during break where steve yells at us and we yell back at steve oh it stops right there huh  just goes back and forth so what did uh what happened between you and travis because you guys are both  pissed off yeah travis is not happy right now no look i i understand that i'm in charge of a lot  of show prep but i also can't check every single website in you know the short amount of time that 
[01:24:00]  i have and i'm kind of tired of coming what are you on french bulldogs.com i wish i'm kind of tired of  coming in at 4 15 or 4 30 and doing a uh as much as i can before the show starts and watching other  people come in later and later and then like why should why am i getting more work when who's coming 
[01:24:30]  in late travis you were just the first person i talked to i'm gonna tell everybody i was gonna tell  everybody that we just have to add one more site to the list but it amazes me we're not uh you know  looking at a website like people.com i mean this show needs to be on top of sports entertainment  local news national news and when you think entertainment yeah we a lot of us think tmz  and stuff but people.com is more mainstream entertainment news it's it's weird to hear  like all of a sudden now travis is saying he wants to come in at 3 30 it's like travis you don't need  to do that who's coming in later and later by the way yeah uh there's no secrets we're all what are we 
[01:25:00]  doing well everybody usually the last people to arrive at the office as it has been for a while are steve  and eric oh are you saying there's a little liaison going on between the two you mean steve the executive  producer of the op and anthony show is that what you're saying today travis oh boy that isn't good  i'm not breaking any you know secrets here no he's right he's right but i like i'm not i'm not sitting  there you know uh doing my nails i'm up at three o'clock in the morning and i do work at home 
[01:25:30]  but yeah i did notice you on myspace this morning yes at four o'clock in the morning  holy jesus steve looks angry man wow because i know i wasn't not no wait wait no no no my that  myspace thing is signed on all night sometimes so and i'm not surfing around it but i'm not  tooling around on it so i got an instant message from you at 3 10 come on  hello well it was just a friendly hello danny's implying that steve was up uh basically filibustering  well you know well here's here's what i think travis was trying yes danny with you know but he's 
[01:26:00]  kind of stumbling around a little bit i think he was just frustrated that he's in you know busting  his ass at most days 4 15 to 4 30 in the morning and then steve comes in at you know 5 10 5 15 and  then he's the one yelling at travis how come you didn't look at people.com today so i could see how  that could be frustrating well first of all i'm not in at 5 10 5 15 yes um today today actually i  if i rolled in at 5 10 it's my fault i was a little bit late okay what about but okay by and 
[01:26:30]  large i'm not in i'm not in that late every day all right uh i'm not travis is here for the first  thing every morning and you know what and he does he does do a lot of work but you know i do a ton  of work at home all right i sleep maybe three and a half hours a night all right all right well  good give yourself a medal all right i don't i don't bring it up in arguments  you know what i don't i don't give off the people i only get three hours why is it why is it that i  get yelled at why is it that i get yelled at by ope and then i tell you guys to do the same thing 
[01:27:00]  and i and you talk back and i'm not talking back to him oh whoa whoa  steve i just think what travis does with that i just think it could delegate it better i don't  think that because you got yelled at for not checking people.com that now 12 of us have to  check people.com every morning what you have to understand is anytime you guys mess up i get yelled  at anytime somebody does something wrong on staff i get the crap for it oh okay just yell at us 
[01:27:30]  directly and maybe just cut out the middleman oh oh honestly like sure you get yelled at because  you're the executive producer but you know like if i miss something i have no problem taking  responsibility for it you know but i'm doing the absolute best i can and i'm coming in as early  as i need to be here you missed the pat o'brien thing i yeah and you know what like that's  oh it happens you know like wow steve i don't know dude i don't know how i would feel if i worked here  wait what happened no it was just a little brute how do we uh blame eroc for this one that's all i need 
[01:28:00]  we should be working in a mail room at this point and that's true when eroc gets uh it does something  bad you don't get yelled at for that steve sometimes i do yeah for eroc's mistakes we but we love  yelling at eroc individually right but sometimes when something gets messed up and you guys don't  know immediately where it came from oh i'm the first one that takes the bullet well that's kind  of like you're the lieutenant you know i understand that's what happens when you're the executive  i'm going to catch a lot of it check your fire check your fire but you know and i understand that i 
[01:28:30]  can't be buddy buddy with everybody but you know what i get i get i get these guys talking back  every time i have to reprimand somebody for screwing up and i'm sorry but that's the way it is how come  it's us that it's screwing up oh wow i have to admit that i messed up by not policing you guys good  enough or not oh yeah so he messes up because he's not policing so who police so who polices us when  when you leave at 11 15 oh oh damn right not people damn that one was that that was now anthony 
[01:29:00]  we're looking at 110 mile an hour serve right now let's see what steve does yeah yeah steve  what um i feel bad that travis is getting yelled at because he didn't look at people.com when it  could be it's a task that could be easily accomplished by anybody you you could check  out people.com yeah and now i'm going to at five in the morning i'm going to now okay so  then why is it why does it need to be something that's that's being yelled at in the hallway it's  not just travis that's what upset me every danny you're getting told too everybody has to 
[01:29:30]  check people.com now okay but the thing is i think that i think that between me me travis and sam  i think a lot of show prep gets done in the time that we arrive to the time that showtime i'm not  disagreeing with you and beyond but i think that maybe if if something was overlooked there are  still other resources that can handle these tasks i'm not saying and i'll and there's at least  two people that could probably handle looking at checking out you know a couple of things if we  just don't have the ability to do so that's not in in show prep i'm not refusing steve if you're 
[01:30:00]  saying you're saying well one of you guys is going to do it every time that there's a task  that you know it needs to be assigned instead of just taking responsibility and say yes i will make  sure sure it just gets assigned there's plenty of times there's there's plenty of times that i assign  these tasks to myself but a lot of times i'm doing more than one thing at a time oh  all right the pendulum is swinging back the other way steve if you're getting swamped please by all  means we're very capable staff oh yeah exactly and then and now look what happens i'm getting i'm 
[01:30:30]  getting looked off at so yeah i think danny might be talking about uh bigger things than just checking  people.com whoa see this is more widespread this is more widespread there mikey that was  accusatory he feels that he's got a thousand things going on at once well then maybe instead of trying  to handle all a thousand things at once like i said there's a capable staff divvy out some of the  things that you get maybe is is cluttering your plate and then everything will get done which may 
[01:31:00]  come as a shock but i actually do delegate a lot of that stuff so now that there's 500 things covering  my plate instead of a thousand things okay which one is honey well there's something going on later  on this week that oh a lot of uh a lot of attention on my and we need attention focused on that  whatever that thing may be were you trying to talk over jim norton's head with that statement steve  certain festivities yes there's something hello carvel  certain b day festivities keep it under your hat because he's standing right there you guys need 
[01:31:30]  a staff retreat that's what you need you need to go camping so what's what we all need to get nude  and hug each other in the woods man a drum circle oh so steve is saying a lot of attention here  of this very important event yeah obviously this yeah um don't get your hopes up by the way why it's  it's going to be a bash to end all bashes i've heard uh and why is eroc continuing to be late 
[01:32:00]  why well eroc when did you come in microphone oh i'm sorry that has been something that's been  discussed so many times on this very i've never seen steve just put the mic i've never seen anyone  happier to put down a microphone oh thank god steve don't like this at all he just makes him very  uncomfortable all i can tell you uh some people's stock is going way up and some people's uh stock is  going way down young sam your stock is going way up yes eroc your stock is like citadel stock oh at  this point oh wow that hurts that hurts that's almost racist 
[01:32:30]  it's like citadel what's citadel remember we got in at 19 a share what 80 cents baby we're up a penny  80 cents from yesterday what time did eroc because eroc just doesn't give a crap like like we we do  everything we're like you have to be here before five and he does it for a couple days and goes all  right i don't think anyone's paying attention anymore and then he starts showing up at 5 15  again eric why is that eroc comment comment there's no explanation for that wow he just gave the no 
[01:33:00]  excuse sir you threw yourself on the mercy of these idiots that's what you just did eroc you already got  passed up for a promotion what do you think is going to happen when like this whole thing gets uh  reorganized how dumb are you really i don't know just been working on every uh every piece of audio  that we have here archiving worst of going through everything that's all oh wow wow now that uh here  comes he's being waved in he's being called in off the bench by the rest of the crew oh my god this 
[01:33:30]  could get up eroc standing up oh boy uh sam is getting a microphone daddy started laughing and  waved in and let's uh acknowledge that pat duffy has been working for free for over two years for  the opening for two years with that said pat duffy who definitely wants eroc's job yes  i've been doing the archiving oh wow a complete contradiction to what eroc just said i believe 
[01:34:00]  pat okay this is from the intern who's now too good to do anything unless it's on air anymore  majority of the crap that i do i get talked to by steve said why are you doing all this  delegate it to somebody else okay so i've been asked you've been wanting to learn a lot more  stuff jared has and a couple other guys so i've shown you how to archive everything if we have a  million things on one subject it's got to be condensed down to one disc so that's what i ask you to do so  this way that it's archived properly i can put in the book put in the system whatever it needs to be 
[01:34:30]  done all right this is a lot of busy work i know who are you yelling at eric oh oh damn  rikers island now point duffy point duffy this is no i haven't been hearing from other interns and  other stuff but every time you go into the back there why do i have to do this crap why does this  keep going on perhaps he's got a little seniority he's been here two years working for free anthony  with that we give uh the floor to danny who's over there don't you know if you hand in  uh your work in his handwriting you're gonna get fired oh hello mcfly do you know what'll happen 
[01:35:00]  if i hand in my work in your handwriting oh wow you did not go there daddy so wait do you think  eric that you don't care like you're a slacker eric you're you're putting a bunch of stuff together  and you're having him just put the final touch on it all he's doing is everything that is combined  uh that we we save say like anthony bits sam's stuff all that stuff we'll have a stack of discs  on this stuff i give it to to pat or somebody i said can you just rip this to the computer put it 
[01:35:30]  all on one disc once it's done they give it to me i put it in the book i'll go through it whatever  and it's there it's archived it's put into the dilette system so we always have it so you just  admitted you give him the stuff to do the work and then he gives it back to you when the work's done  what is it you'd say you do here oh oh two bombs are here okay steve oh why don't you go home and 
[01:36:00]  make a jumps to conclusion game uh what buddy rock i don't want to hear from steve or anybody  or anybody else bitching about why i'm here um like to one two or something like that because  i'm doing all this stuff when i was told originally to start to stop staying late and to delegate it to  other people who told you that i did him you were told to stop staying late yes why because i got it  from him i got it from higher up than him why are you still here at one two three o'clock in the 
[01:36:30]  afternoon oh well i had just got in  iraq has a time management problem iraq you're you're fighting for your job at this point so what do  you have to say to these guys oh you look funny so so wait but that why would they ask because he  why would they ask you to go home if you stay late like what happened because i'm here too late i'm  spending too much time at the other place steve uh yeah steve comment no he was he was here way too 
[01:37:00]  late doing work and he was he wasn't sleeping enough like four o'clock in the afternoon sometimes  what do you think he's gonna go home and go to sleep at four no but you know what there was  i you know it was it was a chronic problem he was here archiving stuff really late at night and  that's not a good argument against iraq i gotta be honest the guy was staying here working too hard  we're afraid he wasn't gonna sleep eric's been doing a lot better like that's not a good argument  against iraq i gotta say i do remember there was a time period where like eric was he was here late 
[01:37:30]  but it was like ope said it was because he was spending his time just poorly but like he's he's  improved and like you know he's not doing that stuff anymore wow steve who would you fire if you  could you um hmm but you absolutely wait what did iraq just say he said you wow fire opie why  not an opie oh you'd fire steve huh oh damn okay you've just been polled all right wait i asked the 
[01:38:00]  question was asked steve who would you fire if you could and iraq said you meaning you here's why  and this is not personal steve but i'm getting the same s for the stuff that i wasn't doing or i was  doing in the past now that i changed it because i've been talked to by you by higher ups to uh  manage to start delegating to interns who were sitting around getting coffee or doing nothing  as i was told okay started delegating the stuff and look what happens i'm getting the same s again  so like if i if i'm trying to do more work for the show there's a problem if i'm trying to um 
[01:38:30]  delegate it to other people who i'm not 100 sure so even when pat combines stuff or butcher cuts up  some worse or whatever i still got to go through what they did they may have saved me some time by  condensing it but i still got to go through it for as far as what goes on the air so i have other  people doing the stuff that i was originally doing right and i'm getting s again for it and that's why you  come in at 5 15. no that's yeah dude if i can roll in at 557 i mean you can absolutely get here at 
[01:39:00]  four sorry there was a funny story i know i've just i've been defending eric  for the last for the last few minutes but there was a funny story that did come up uh a few months  ago did you say funny story yes i did get ready for the funny everybody all right you're ready for  the funny laughing hat i'm confident he says all right wow the confidence look at his he's sitting  with his legs legs crossed a little bit he really doesn't like dick cavett now yes he's ready yeah 
[01:39:30]  well no i do remember it's not even my story to be fair it is it's more sam's but uh  uh eric had come into the studio in the morning it was probably about 5 15 5 20 he was late that day  and he was talking to sam about if sam had saw uh raw or whatever wwe program was on the night  before and uh eric had let sam know that uh he was catching up on it before he left the house that  morning so as he's showing up late he's telling sam about how he was busy watching wrestling wrestling  before you come in in the morning what's wrong with you i was getting changed oh steve's leaving 
[01:40:00]  i'm also getting oh steve where you going what happened i'm also getting uh reports here um  from uh from from pal talk yeah that says eric stays in the office on pal talk in the ron and  fez room he's not working oh so that's uh some reports that are coming in off of that is that  you're not spending that time that you're in here uh working that you're on pal talk in the ron and  fez room no comment no if i have it on yeah but it's never that i'm not working i'll have to defend 
[01:40:30]  eric on this sometimes he does he does dawdle but at the same time it's it's it's one of those  situations you just use the word dawdle yeah sometimes he dawdles does he lollygag occasionally  he is doing work there's two computers that he works from so while he's doing work if he happens  to have that up yeah so be it it looks it whereas if someone looking at his camera it just looks  like he's staring at the pal talks right okay actually all righty there's a little defense steve  who i know that because i'm here let's uh before break before break steve who would you fire 
[01:41:00]  don't be polite either yeah iraq certainly wasn't no uh truthfully i wouldn't i wouldn't fire anybody  right now shut up oh i wouldn't oh there's gotta be someone no there's i mean everybody is working  very hard cop out i don't believe you no it's not a cop at all all right not a cop at all we have to  take a break we're 25 minutes late for our break when we come back i want an answer from steve because  steve is it was annoyed he doesn't like being disrespected and you know and i want to point 
[01:41:30]  out that mike de stefano is just terrific the last 25 minutes just amazing radio on your part mike  unbelievable stuff i don't know what you were just terrific uh friday july 25th and 26th  lake shore theater in chicago illinois for tickets uh go to lakeshore theater.com  he contributed uh a little more than stunt brain did during that segment  i'm sitting here thinking i don't know if i want to be a part of this kind of organization  you guys are violent you're ready to kill each other it's ridiculous by the way as we go to 
[01:42:00]  break i just want to remind people 77 days left in our contract right and all hell has started to  break starting to throw each other under the bus it's gonna get up yeah 77 i want an answer when we  get back and also we forced um sam to do some prime time gossip about his own girl yes his own girl and  seth green so we're gonna see what he came up with that's like a bit cuckold you're like how to sit  there and do that and we got some what's the haps we got mike de stefano and other things 
[01:42:30]  opie and anthony on your radio dial mike de stefano in studio playing the lakeshore theater  chicago illinois friday july 25th and 26th tickets through lakeshore theater.com  also i want to throw that out there i think we need to alert the media we haven't had a uh alert  the media thing in a while i want everyone to hear this today all american ford has given us a car to 
[01:43:00]  give away and this is what we're thinking because we're smart we're smart we're thinking of just taking  this car from all american ford a really nice one by the way leaving it on the streets of new york with  the keys in it and the listeners have to find it just find it just go out there and find it yourself  that's right he's in the ignition you find the car you drive away with the car a puerto rican's gonna 
[01:43:30]  win and he's not even gonna be a listener see mikey said something i said something funny mike  de stefano i'm smart i can do things this is what we're thinking of doing with this car from all  american ford so keep listening for uh for details either way we're definitely giving away  this car thank you all american ford mike de stefano he played the animation festival about  a month ago a little over a month ago at this point yep and um the listeners they were just a 
[01:44:00]  bunch of animals that night yeah uh the animation festival was a huge success but the comedians you  know were getting beat up pretty bad and mike was pretty much having a nervous breakdown behind the  scenes and we gave you a pep talk you went out there and you killed yeah you destroyed those  animals i did huh you turned them right around my friend yeah you think i don't know man i i uh  it was nuts it was crazy you're right i wanted to leave yeah i really want after what they did  to natterman i'm like i got to get out of here which just wasn't fair it wasn't yeah he didn't uh  you know we're thinking our new york audience has gotten spoiled so now we're going to start doing 
[01:44:30]  gigs like in other cities yeah i think they're just the kind of people that like if if it's not  opie anthony or norton kill it like that's it you know kill it it's not familiar you know hit it in  the head with something yeah exactly yeah yeah it's like it's scary i wouldn't mind if uh they gave  like natterman they didn't even give natterman oh my god no chance that's really that's the problem i  had with the animation festival with uh natterman getting beat up they didn't even give him a chance  no chance if i was a fan of your show like uh like you know i am a fan of your show but if i was 
[01:45:00]  like a fan fan and not a comic i would come to the show like thinking wow opie and anthony i love  them they must know what they're doing bringing in this guy dan adam let me listen to him yeah we  really want to bring in some new guys yeah they're just animals they're animals and it was actually you  know what i had a great time when it was all over with i was a little rattled because i didn't even  know what i said i want to see a tape i know i said some some good stuff i just don't know what it was  no you did really really no idea i remember screaming at them like i was beating like a guy 
[01:45:30]  that owed me money yeah and i was beating him in the face with a ball peen hammer and i remember him  giving me the money and that's what the audience like they was in other words i was calling them  names for the first six minutes and they were clapping and i'm like wait a minute they like  me i don't have to beat them up anymore and then i tried to do some jokes and they didn't get the jokes  so i had to go beat them up again and close no they got your jokes in the end yeah yeah you're down  playing and you really did very very well man good thanks man i appreciate like mike a lot and 
[01:46:00]  he's gonna you know start doing more and more with us and uh hopefully more appearances on the  radio show yeah i just want to i appreciate you guys bringing me in because i just i'm trying to  get out there and get some uh people to come to my shows you know what i mean because it's crazy i  just i just got ripped off by a club i i went to a club in kalamazoo look at norton's head goes up  because he can't like he we can't sometimes i told them they go oh i'm booked there next month i hope  they're still open what i i'm just telling you got ripped off you moron they gave me a beat check  for two grand and uh i called them and their cell phones are dead they sent me an email saying they're 
[01:46:30]  they're they had a plumbing problem and they'll get they'll get the money i'll get the money when  they reopen so i wrote back i'd rather you can keep the money i just want to one of you to put a gun  in my face and be a man like really rob someone yeah oh i hate that so i've been really depressed  about that lately and then i come in here today and i'm i'm still depressed it was called uh what  was it called it was called uh the laughing post the clown that used to own uh riddles in chicago 
[01:47:00]  you ever play that one jimmy see you've been out of my league for the last eight years no it's true  no like you're you haven't been exposed to this kind of stuff you got agents and managers  jimmy doesn't have to play the laughing post yeah well no and he deserves you know he's that he's where  he is and it's like you know you can't you i still have to go out and do a gig that i don't  really trust i don't know the club i don't know the people but i don't know how you guys do it  really it was booked through a legitimate agency in new york you know frosty booked it for me and uh 
[01:47:30]  you know he's upset he's trying to get the money it's crazy and it's not the money really it's just  the idea of god how could you do that like uh you know it took me six hours to drive from chicago to  to the gig because it was pouring rain and i get there i did the show i did a great weekend killed  you know and uh they give me a check and it bounced really really depressing yeah i just don't like the  way they're handling it because occasionally the club will screw up absolutely handling it after no 
[01:48:00]  no dude they sent it out to you immediately it's got another dude they're there this was a sk  this was a gangster move they closed the club they shut down they ripped off me and smoky that dude  smokey and a colored fella from uptown harlem he's a comedian he's very funny colored fellow i  bring i'm bringing that back i think it's bringing it back um no he's a friend of mine so i just kid  around but you know they ripped off two of us this was not a a mistake if someone you know i don't  want to i don't want to uh give away too much but mike d stefano is not the type of guy you should be 
[01:48:30]  ripping off that i mean i know you do i i hear things about you that you might know a few people  so that's not even that not smart thank you but not smart that's not even you know i'm a nice guy  like i don't want to be but yeah if if you walk into a room and it's like me and and anthony and you  know and like four or five other guys you don't go to me first to just to take my wallet you know what  i mean don't go to me either yeah no i you know i mean jim i love you but i would probably get you 
[01:49:00]  you go for you or opie but i keep my money in my socks oh i i have my wallet in my front yeah no  it's just stupid so always keep a dime in your shoe for a phone call certainly don't rip off mike  he's got the guy has prison tattoos yeah he's got prison tattoos that's right and i've never even been  in prison and just the tattoos yeah and i know i went in to get the tattoos yeah this is how badass  mike is the next tattoo he gets is going to be right on his neck no yeah you're not going to be 
[01:49:30]  you're not going to be you know playing around anymore i'm gonna get a tattoo on my neck this is  i'm afraid of commitment what oh come on that's come on jim's the only guy in the room nothing  well making a commitment jimmy's in the middle of eating an apple or he would have gave you some  love for that no that's good man i'm very healthy yeah thank you oh thanks man whenever jim walks  through the cellar to go to the bathroom and i'm on stage i go i hope he's listening to my jokes  oh boy no all right never mind i'm gonna say normally when i walk because i love it 
[01:50:00]  i don't i try not to listen to other comedians because you don't i don't want to hear something  subliminally pick it up and not realize i'm picking it up yeah do somebody else's joke that's what  frightens me about going into that no but when you go through i really really turn it on and try to get  you to listen hoping that you don't know uh kim in massachusetts has something for the show kim  hey guys uh big fan love the show and my husband is an even bigger fan so he would want me to say  love you jimmy oh god love him so hi chris honey if you're listening but anyway i found out yesterday 
[01:50:30]  that it is um bear week in provincetown and i just thought maybe steve might be a little distracted  because he probably wishes he could go down there and check that out just as you said that we went  to the official uh bear bear week website it's called uh keytownbears.org oh and it's provincetown  and it's it's work friendly barely but it is barely you got two four six seven lovable bears

[02:07:30]  why aren't we uh getting somebody that from bear week you want somebody from bear week really there's  got to be someone that's in charge of the festivities up there we need to talk i will  delegate that that is in charge of bear week in provincetown somebody else we want to send a picture  of you in can we do that no no but i i gotta hear what the activities are for bear week i will delegate  that appropriately or could we at least go on the website and find out some info about bear  weeks before we miss the boat on that one all right ass hair braiding 
[02:08:00]  come on you tell me i don't say nothing i'm trying to throw out some gems  uh yes steve iraq said he would fire you and they said it wasn't personal but no it never  is how about we give let's give steve a night to think about it but tomorrow you have to come up  with an answer on who you would fire from the show the only reason i don't want you to give the name  now right because it's gonna cause a s storm and we're running out of show it's so obvious to me 
[02:08:30]  who he would want to fire it's not even close i want a real answer to but also a reason i won't say  it okay but i know who it is and it's not even there's not even a close second i say you're gonna  be surprised because i know what you're thinking i know what i know yeah yep that's right and he keeps  himself okay we definitely want an answer tomorrow and and why yeah of course oh all right and uh  before we go thank you polite so tomorrow's the day steve you tell uh iraq said you should be fired 
[02:09:00]  so you know you shouldn't hold back but that's iraq you really should uh have a name by tomorrow  uh give the mic to roland because roland saw the dark night with us with his uh with his brother who's  very much like uh roland except he's bigger yeah and even more insane i hear uh i actually asked  roland i wasn't even trying to make a joke because it wasn't even on the air i go roland has your  brother ever killed anyone because i'm convinced he might have yeah yeah i heard you say that like  on the side i thought you were kidding but then i said no this is not a joke no because we're not on 
[02:09:30]  the air and roland goes well i i'm not sure 100 but maybe and roland i think i think you're an  animal roger's an animal too because he got my cell phone yesterday i know he pushes everybody  out of the way dude it was such a nightmare because you couldn't bring your cell phone into  dark night they put them in little plastic bags right and then after the movie you have to hand  over your ticket stub and get your phone back you think that would be pretty easy but the imax  probably fits what 500 people how many people in that theater 300 300 a little bit more than 
[02:10:00]  that jim more than 300 okay 550 i think oh wow okay is it really all right let's say 500 people  to be on the safe side and probably 450 of them brought their cell phone so you can imagine that  it could be a quite a problem at the end of the movie and they only had three guys oh uh giving  your cell phone back so it was just a mom so this roger roland's brother just pushed his way and no  one was gonna say no to this guy he's six three think of roland's six three and bigger yeah even at 
[02:10:30]  concerts though like for springsteen like there's no seats we'll go up front and people push he turns  around and challenges people and everybody just steps back what do you mean like some people kept  on pushing him when we were springsteen he turned around snapped and everybody took a big step back  what did he say he was pushing me oh no worse hey cut that out the words hey what's the big idea  wait what's the word he said like he'll like knock everybody out and people freaked out even the  security to leave him alone make way ow ow ow my back is sorry why is your back sword today 
[02:11:00]  because i slept on the floor because my brother's here in town i slept on the bed you slept on the  floor where'd your brother live and why doesn't he sleep on the floor have you seen him he's scared of  his brother does he look like you does he have does he look like him yes he does now the thing that the  thing that's scary about you is not how big you are because you are a big guy you just look like you  would forget to stop hitting the guy it was just you just look the judge would be like why roland why 
[02:11:30]  were you still punching the guy he was dead for three days he'd be like i don't just you know mike  makes a great point yeah that describes roland he does really have that look like we yeah we've  seen that side of him a couple times oh he gets we were very surprised that he he just gets mean and  nasty yeah when is roger going back uh tomorrow morning but he's flying back in for springsteen can we  have him on the show i want to have him in we want a roland roger thing yeah well he'll be back 
[02:12:00]  next time for a week so he'll have more time i think he's coming back like next week roland  can't even book roger on the show all right roland you're gonna do a photo with roger the first time  but his people are his people we have to take him uh somebody else i just like because i have a hard  wood floor in my apartment and he goes i'm going to bed and he just jumped on the bed you guys  guys you have to take one of my cousins first and then if it goes well and they get to give you  my brother that's funny all right you booked yourself and roger on the show when he comes back  for springsteen he passed i'm sorry he passed can you sleep on the floor i had no choice i just had 
[02:12:30]  a sleeping bag and he goes good night and he passed out like all right hey uh we're running on  the show a roll and of course uh we love your movie reviews you saw the dark night jimmy and i have  been raving about this movie all morning i think it's a really heath ledger's movie basically he's  gonna get an oscar nod all that crap blah blah blah what did you roll and think of dark night  it was awesome i'll probably go see it again like three more times or four i just loved the acting 
[02:13:00]  he was amazing who he said he was amazing um gary oldman was phenomenal even aaron eckhart was really  good yep as um harvey dent what'd you think of a batman i liked him i'm batman i'm not exaggerating  you'll never have to but it's like everybody in theater got his voice changed but i just heard  jimmy go oh i was so irritated uh yeah i can see what you're saying i didn't even see the movie but  i know that actor and i could just see him trying to be he's just i never liked him but as bruce 
[02:13:30]  wayne he's great like yeah because he's a psycho you never liked christian bell so he was good in  psycho that psycho movie played go american psycho go see the machine i could see how he wouldn't be  good as batman though like i can see he's great in that he's good in uh the prestige yeah he's very  good he was i find him as a fine actor holy crap i just realized i never saw the prestige oh you gotta  see that i saw the other one that was just like the illusion now the illusion is blue compared to  the prestige is the prestige is good that one's good especially if you just you know you don't know 
[02:14:00]  about it you can also see him in i was in fistful of dollars and a lot of other sergio leone movies  this is what jimmy's talking about i never said thank you  and you'll never have to yeah could i have a lozenge it's i have a sucret it's terrible because  again i understand he's doing it to the skies the void it's distracting and terrible wow 
[02:14:30]  that because it's it's a terrible yeah wow you'll never have to roland what do you like about  what do you like about heath ledger as the joker uh you actually believe he was a psychopath in the  film i mean he was just amazing just his little nuances he does his facial expressions yeah especially  when the one scene when he was interrogated it was so good and you're right there was a lot of  close-ups too yeah they had a lot of heath ledger close-ups on the makeup the creepy face scar 
[02:15:00]  oh he was good yeah oh he was disturbing that was really good and even though like no one's  like creepy enough to just feel the same but the producers are kind of have to be happy that the  guy died like deep down you know and it's awful to say that and yeah like deep down and going wow  this really sucks but it made us a lot of money it definitely helps it's awful man it's not that a  movie like dark knight needs the help but absolutely yeah hey uh really fast uh it's too bad we've  we've run out of show thanks roland you and roger when he comes back for springsteen please uh 
[02:15:30]  police world's greatest dad sought sex with 14 year old girl we we don't get to do much on this  unfortunately yeah the picture up on ona radio though there's stump brain it's a picture of this  guy and he's wearing a uh wwe world's greatest dad t-shirt and that's what he wore to go have sex with  a 14 year old girl a 33 year old michigan man is accused of wearing a world's greatest dad shirt  to a meeting for sex with what he thought was a 14 year old girl oh it wasn't his daughter no no  that would have been a perfect shirt yeah see he is the world's greatest dad he didn't go after the

[02:22:00]  breather and focus on the second half of the radio it's just a little like walk it off a little  bit you know how when you're at work you get a little break yeah yeah that's our break and you  might want to just hang out and not talk or do anything on the way over today we were talking  about the show and how they're helping me promote sometimes you want to do that and then hope he  mentioned about i hope this colored guy don't come near us colored colored guy and you know good  luck getting that back into i'm trying i'm trying yeah it was also race for right at the cellar last 
[02:22:30]  night two comics were just going at it keith and uh brennan okay robinson oh my god it was  fucking bro i i walked away i was uncomfortable it got so heated kevin was saying that like black  people enjoy being stupid like literally verbatim it's like you guys that's like your and then keith  went nuts like he got so angry i don't blame him i mean it was a pretty vicious thing to say and then  they just went at it and it was bizarre it was crazy and you know there's no it wasn't it wasn't 
[02:23:00]  a dialogue on race uh i want to interrupt you for a second because fox news and we could definitely go  back to that uh the faa is uh investigating why a delta jet engine fell off the plane and left the  crater in some farm in the middle of nowhere did the plane crash crater where it fell in street it just  no they could fly with one engine just shoot out the back engine fell off delta jet you imagine one 
[02:23:30]  of your engines falls off look at this in the middle of the road that's where it hit bam it looked like  a it looked like a field why engine fell off delta jet and it looked like an md-80 which only has uh  two on the back i was flying my bad plane and i bumped into the engine  what are the odds of losing both engines while you're flying there jimmy probably uh 20  percent can faulty wiring take out two uh engines or you should say that on certain uh planes like 
[02:24:00]  the dc10 was a faulted model because uh there's a very famous united flight and uh there was an  explosion of some sort it was some kind of a rotator blade that blew out but it not only blew  out the uh the elevator control which controls the uh the fall yes the balance yes but or the up and  down uh it blew out the two backups so a faulty wire or whatever or so whatever it is can do it in a  poorly designed plane i think that was the uh l-1011 the one with the three engines on the back it was 
[02:24:30]  the dc10 and the top one okay with dc10 yes the three engines dc10 you guys really have this information  this is true i guarantee you know what they're talking about these guys these guys i get all my flying  info from dc10 is l-1011 a form of dc10 i don't know what that is the lockheed model the douglas is  the dc10 oh no this is a dc10 it was a united flight um and what happened was the one there's  very famous footage of this thing crash landing in iowa where the plane comes down yeah dc10s look  like uh md-80s no with the two engines oh no dc10s were cross-country monsters they had a massive 
[02:25:00]  engine on the back it was very awkward looking on the back yeah l-1011 probably the same similar  plane but dc10 um i'm just arguing i don't know if the l-1011 had the same design flow the dc10 had  but they were flying these pilots were flying and that they lost and you should hear that they had  the cockpit control they're like yeah this is united flight uh whatever we uh we lost elevator control  and uh they they actually steered the plane by firing one engine yeah they had two engines on the  wings one on the tail what's this chick dancing look at us we're gonna get back to the final story 
[02:25:30]  and and we'll talk about jet engines in a second but holy shit there's a what what that was a teen  dancing web the graphic was there's a a new web campaign encouraging teen girls to strip on the  web what is that about that is horrible if the guys are listening in the back could you find more  info on that it was just on fox news encouraging teens to strip yes i can't get back to jimmy with  the airplane yeah there's very famous footage of the the iowa crash where the plane kind of comes in 
[02:26:00]  sideways and you and you just use there's a building so it blocks it all of a sudden you  just see a ball of flame falling but half the people survived the flight they all should have died  and they almost yeah almost they almost made it you're right and it was a very great document  there was another pilot on board he was in first class who flew why was he bored i think he was just  very tuckered out i don't know he was at the bat cave dc 10 and the l-1011 look very much exactly  alike why are you squinting when you do your batman because that's what he does behind the max 
[02:26:30]  max and uh there's a pilot named denny fitch who is flying uh with and he actually went up and  assisted and they were firing one engine to steer pilots in simulators couldn't even simulate how  they did it they could not believe that these guys they all should have died yeah pilots are  amazing man oh yeah it's a rare it's a it's hard for a plane to actually crash people don't realize  that they can they got so many options before they crash so many options yeah they had 30 000 they were  at 30 000 feet that's amazing they had one of the guys in the plane was actually one of the designers 
[02:27:00]  of the plane of the planes like hydraulic system they really got lucky with that guy and he was  able to assist assist in the cockpit and help them uh steer the plane with the two wing engines  well denny fitch is the guy i'm talking about he was a pilot i didn't know he he uh are you sure  he designed some of the yeah there was one of the guys that was on board the plane design had  something to do with the design of the plane so he went into the cockpit and helped out  but then right at the last minute they just couldn't bring it back around fast enough they 
[02:27:30]  were land they were coming in for a landing but the problem was they could they had no control over  the fucking aircraft and they could not slow it down yeah um so what happened was they were landing  too fast they were probably it was probably going to blow up when they hit the ground they had fuel on  it uh and as they're coming in they're coming in they had to the fire one of the engines to make a  last second adjustment and now that threw it sideways yeah and it just landed car wheeled yeah but i mean  they were coming in way too fast i think they probably all would have died if they landed that  way that's sick yeah all the uh that that that engine on the tail came apart and all even the 
[02:28:00]  redundant hydraulic systems all went through that part of the tail and just got shredded yeah there was  so they had nothing like redundance and that was a design flaw because all of them yeah why would  you put your redundant systems all next to each other yeah it's ridiculous it's like this place  that was in that was in sidewalks uh city by the way yes it was you're right and what about that  damn food they serve how about the peanuts yeah those peanuts what do they give you those little bags 
[02:28:30]  of peanuts for and what's the deal with that uh jim is right and is wrong and then we got this guy  scott in new hampshire he's a commercial uh pilot he wants in on the discussion yeah it was it was  at dc 10 i i admit i was i was in error on that one i was wrong the planes look um yeah very similar  i i i thought it was a cessna myself so uh cessna yeah let's go to scott what's up scott  not much how you guys doing hey no no i just wanted to make sure we were on the right track  because uh jimmy mentioned like wiring harnesses and in fact you i think uh opie said it that the 
[02:29:00]  cause of that susi crash was a hydraulic failure not a wiring harness electrical issue right right but  we that's what kind of segwayed the discussion it was uh it was a blowout of a rotor blade  and uh that it was it was a rotor blade that blew out and maybe wiring didn't cause it but we're  just going over how like yeah yeah the problem is in the l1011 and the dc9 because they have that  rear-mounted center thrust engine you got all the redundant systems in the tail and once that 
[02:29:30]  elevated the rudder taken out there's no basically light them up folks you're going down okay i'm out  it's the same design for both okay yeah yeah but what about those fucking peanuts pal mike i says to  myself why do they have such a small portion back to you why do i gotta put my seat belt on  yeah if we're gonna crash into a fucking ding i'm the seat belt's not gonna stop me hey no let me  tell you the real solution you know how to get the black box out of it after the track why don't 
[02:30:00]  they just make the whole plane out of the black box why don't they oh play me out of the black box  let's see how to answer that let's say hi to brian in philly we're moving on because we got that we  got uh the schedule of uh bear week in provincetown we got uh uh yes brian hey good morning guys uh  happy birthday jimmy thanks a lot big boy thank you all right um anyway that uh campaign uh that 
[02:30:30]  uh website where uh teens are encouraged to strip it's part of a virgin mobile campaign to uh donate  clothes to uh like shelters or some kind of charity that supports the homeless um the the i checked it  out last night the girls in strip they don't really show anything um they're wearing like t-shirts  or boxer shorts underneath it and uh they just want to get trapped through the website and then  virgin mobile will donate clothes or money to these uh charities why can't we get uh some of our fine  listeners regular girls to start uh making strip uh videos and sending them i would love to see that 
[02:31:00]  we could take this campaign and do it the right way where you see tits and ass yeah but right that  would be just that would be honest though that would be too honest they want to they want to make us  think we're going to touch these little girls but who's going to buy stuff from them they use it to  market who's going to be the first overage girl or uh legal girl to strip for us not a professional  a regular girl that thinks she's really hot and then we uh promote the hell out of it come on let's  go let's get some things done let's go wait oh oh fucking uh the red they uh the girl with the

[02:33:00]  what's he doing today oh look at the president of the catholic league bill donahue is on uh  fox what is that what's the the problem wants to bring back lighting people is web promo too sexy  and tacky for charities i guess he's the one talking about the uh strippy thing the strippy thing let's  the strippy thing it's older taking over you must keep making those monthly people no that isn't it  that's his fox that's cnn is your bank look at this okay oh all right i don't care that they got 
[02:33:30]  shorts on under it all right they're looking good so far all right uh the fake strip yeah  she's doing a fake strip she's doing a bad strip but uh what about the come on there's equity there's  equity in the um all right she's down a bra very nice look at fox news titillating everyone as they're  trying to discuss if it's good or not can we hear what this fat prick is saying or i hate these  fucking people this is uh bill donahue he got us fired back in the day oh did he really yeah this guy's  a scumbag i don't even know he got you fired i'm not even saying that he's a good pal now is he 
[02:34:00]  really is he really yeah yeah he might be your pal scumbag um mr g's not touching you you can  build on you crack and heroin all right you can all right i think that's the one any money so uh this  no no that's the nnn that is your bank save all right now do it so they have to take off their  pants i don't understand that's a gauchy bunker charities get involved in this bill they probably  got sucked into it because they haven't actually uh behaved very well lately down in richmond 
[02:34:30]  virginia and out in san francisco somebody needs to look into and police them of what they're doing  you know it just strikes me that they're trying to get some attention well they are trying to get  the attention and you know quite frankly it's not about some gal just taking off her pants one of  the pictures that i've seen the gals totally naked oh i forgot she's wearing shoes oh that was clever  you fat fucking animal with heels apparently they're reconsidering this whole deal well yeah a good  idea don't you think yeah we kind of wonder about what kind of person would be drawn to it in the 
[02:35:00]  first place but you know look if they want to do these things girls uh running wild that kind of  middle-aged man who cares are you when they try to say that listen what we're doing it for is a  good course that we're giving money to people you've got a group out in san francisco sisters of  perpetual indulgence they're gay bashing catholics they give a few dollars to into charity and they  say that's okay now if white people dressed up as al josen and started doing a little black tap  dancing stereotypical dancing and said well we're giving money to sickle cell anemia african-americans 
[02:35:30]  and run them out of town that's fucking racist man same thing was with these phonies  don't i hate this i like them thank you yeah even though it's the problem because he gives  examples like that he speaks the truth yo he always gives examples about like he keeps it real islam  this is how people would react and he's like he makes certain good points yeah you're right it's  hard to you know that's what that's what the whole fucking fight was about last night about like  unreasonable like where i'm right you're wrong there isn't no i don't want to know the 
[02:36:00]  reality of it the truth of the whole thing so you're right he has a good point so did reverend  right though you know that black dude that was freaking out if you listen to what he was saying  he was he was right about a lot of shit absolutely reverend right was right about a lot of stuff  the the shit that he was saying oh no no i don't of course not no no of course yeah certain certain  things he said what he was talking about how he feels as a black man at his age in this country  and the reality of what that things have gotten a fuckload better is that what he was saying i'm 
[02:36:30]  not gonna argue with you my friend i understand what you're saying i'm not against never saying  that he said a lot of good stuff the guy did he yeah but it's hard to it's hard to fucking admit that  because if he says a couple things that you hate you know i'm saying like you're a republican so you're  going to stick with you're going to stay it's going to be a republican thing no not really  republican i've been called more libertarian yeah they are too liberal really republican i'm really 
[02:37:00]  a fascist i'm a i'm a nazi i'm a dictator i really i want a dictatorship all right listen can we get to  bear week please i guess they're weak but you're right jeremiah right did say some good stuff did it  what one good thing give me one example just like shit like the white devil had been holding a  brother down like that is real that's good shit yeah no he he had some good stuff he just came  off too angry and it was easy for people to take pot shots at him because he sounded well they should  if he's calling uh whitey the white devil in a church then yeah he should be fucking did he say 
[02:37:30]  that i don't know what he is no no but he was talking about how america has and i'm not a radical  dude but he's saying like how america has brought things to other places and then we get upset when it  comes here and look the bottom line is terrorism that's the truth we didn't bring 9-11 ourselves  at all no we have stuck our fucking noses in everybody else's asshole all over the planet  and it annoys me that we try to morally police people here's what we should do the way we handle 
[02:38:00]  world war ii that's how we should handle things if you fuck with us we will drop a weapon well that  fucking kills 45 000 you're right but you know what the problem was is that after world war ii when uh  the commies got the bomb and we couldn't operate like that anymore so what we had to do was stick  our noses in little places to keep the communist menace from fucking uh taking over europe pretty  much so it took a lot of this covert shit of us taking dictators out popping new ones in it was the 
[02:38:30]  the necessity of the day of the time and yes we did do those things but it was necessary as a super  power to do that now to then say that we were fucked up for doing it no it's what the time was it was  necessary i think that we do that though but what happens is don't expect the other countries not to  hate you and not to i'm i'm only saying our answer should be let them do what they want to do but if  there's a problem our response should be horrendous yeah fucking total horrendous response i agree 
[02:39:00]  why didn't nobody fuck with china i know china's done some dirty shit nobody's got too many people  and bombs and all that right and they're not afraid to use them because they're crazy so no i i i'm not  saying that the u.s brought 9-11 ourselves i don't believe that at all i don't i'm not saying root cause  or any of that but i'm tired of us sticking off fucking goody gumdrops fucking we support some  dictators we don't support the other ones just say that that's fine yeah i don't mind that we do 
[02:39:30]  that it's in self-interest everyone's self-interest well now with the way the world is i definitely  think we should as a country pull back not be this world police that we uh have uh had to have been for  for the the past century i mean we went to iraq was kind of a ridiculous thing to do in a lot of  ways i mean everybody knows that no one gives a shit if those people are free yeah it was like a  fucking chinese guy kicked us in the balls we went and beat up a puerto rican yeah made no goddamn 
[02:40:00]  sense and yet half the people in the country go nope george bush knows what he's doing he's a good  you know i'm just as violent and dishonest as bush i'm not gonna be a fucking phony but thousands of  people aren't dead because of me three they're dead one was still alive when i left him too he was  flopping around jesus drove off holy mother of god i'm kidding it's one of my bits i honestly  thought you killed people lol lol lol lol to you too all right all right bravo thank you can we get 
[02:40:30]  into bear week after the break bear week god opa you're so childish man we're trying to talk about  serious fucking help the community here and by the way i'm not friends you're into hairy homos i don't  like bill donahue still bill donahue didn't know bill donahue i'll say this though we have this  mutual kind of nope you do no but that's like you know what jimmy you said you like they say i don't  care what the fucking anyone who says that we we shouldn't like bill a lot of them say that i don't  give a fuck what any of them say i'm not going out drinking with him but i do have a mutual kind of uh 
[02:41:00]  respect for what he does in some weird way he he has his ideas and he'll stand behind him and all  that happy horse shit which is fine you know if you're gonna do that i i might not like it i'm  not gonna fucking uh like i said go out and drink with the guy um but we did turn him around he's  not coming after us anytime soon we'd have to do something ridiculous for him come after us again  a lot of the instant feedbackers and shit didn't like it what are you guys talking to him for but 
[02:41:30]  what they should be doing is they didn't say the same thing about we start working for cbs they didn't  say hey those are the guys that fired you why are you working for them they didn't come after us and  say that bill donahue what the catholic lead do they put out a press release i think we explained  the cbs thing though i swear to god i'm happy to be there when they uh brought us back everybody  that was part of our firing wasn't at the company anymore made it a little easier but there's a couple  guys there's one guy and i and it's not oh you mean and it's not the big guy at that i'll say it's 
[02:42:00]  not mel but there is a guy if i see i'd have a really tough time not spitting in his face he's not  with the company anymore i don't even think he's in the business anymore eric logan i know well don't  tell me about it i'll fucking spit right in his face eric logan but there's a guy that's a  fucking bear there's a guy that was working at cbs at the time if i see him trust me i i'm gonna  have a problem stevens well sure words sure ken stevens well i'm gonna ken's a great guy i'm gonna  have to get a sloop to go find him oh oh yeah on his boat he's always on his boat in the if you want to 
[02:42:30]  find our old boss he's in the uh what is that uh bay called down there the chesca uh the chesapeake  yes yeah he's uh selling selling and he's been selling ever since he got fired bill donahue put  out a i'm a catholic league supporter but he put out a press release just for no reason going hey look  what's what happened happened we forgive and forget as catholics let it go we wish these guys the best  in a long career it was almost like and his answer when he turned me around is when he goes 
[02:43:00]  when we when people said did you did you hear the broadcast he went no well then why did you react  he goes they they called me and they said people were having anal sex in saint patrick's cathedral  what do you want me to do and it was almost like he's the head of the catholic league yeah he might  say something the media calls the head of the catholic league this radio show has people having anal  sex in saint pat's and then they play in that audio go for it we're all saying it what the  yeah yeah there's any reasonable person expect the head of the catholic league to go he would have to 
[02:43:30]  poo poo that it was never he has to it was never accurately reported that it was indeed  but but you do you see what i'm saying right the old shitter he knows that on this day  this religious day people were in the church and we made a radio bit and there was an arrest  which made the this wasn't speculation there was an arrest what is he supposed to do yeah and jimmy  reminded me he did uh make it very easy for our return with that press release i forgot 
[02:44:00]  completely unsolicited we didn't ask him to do that and when he comes on the show  we we the reason we got him on is we wanted to kill him one day like we were going to attack him  you know uh we get him on the show we're gonna scream at him but he was an honest guy and he's  like hey look i mean uh what's done he was basically saying it wasn't anything personal but that's what  they they tell me that you're having sex in the church what do you want me to do louis ck doesn't like  him very much but but don't even admit that kevin smith i i don't blame them for not liking him  and uh that's fine yeah but at least he tells the truth about not having seen certain things 
[02:44:30]  how many religious leaders or guys like that would ever go back did sharp did ever come back and  actually go look we forgive i'm oh no it's a different vibe with this guy all right very good  i don't care if people out there agree with me or not that's my thing i have no reason to lie i'm  never gonna do anything with bill donahue and here it is from april 20 2006 opian anthony moved  to cbs radio catholic league president bill donahue uh commented today on news reports about a pending  move by cbs radio to higher radio talk show host opian anthony after i lashed out against opian anthony 
[02:45:00]  for providing an on-air account of a sexual stunt in st pat's they were fired by infinity broadcasting  uh once they were dumped i withdrew the uh complaint that i had filed with the fcc and asked the fcc to  drop its investigation on august 5th 2004 i issued a news release about the decision  of xm satellite radio to pick up the duo beginning october 4th at that time i said we wish opian anthony  well and trust they have learned their lesson now cbs radio is set to bring them back on its free fm 
[02:45:30]  outlets free fm to those who say you can't go home again i say nonsense in the year and a half that  opian anthony have been on xm satellite uh radio not a single complaint has reached our office and  anything they've said well that's because we didn't really have listeners back then there uh  bill no one was listening to our horseshit indeed when the two shock jocks were picked up by xm their  producer called one morning asked if i would go on the air with them though i had some reservations i 
[02:46:00]  said yes and was immediately put through they made it clear that they regretted the st pat stunt we mix  it up for a bit and had a great time in short the catholic league hopes opian anthony have a great  run on cbs radio so i forgot about that shimmy i mean and that to me was like only because people  like well you should have done that yeah i agreed but how many guys in that would do it you're right  do that yeah yeah you're right that's cool you open my mind a little bit all right let's go right  the guy we hated him dude i mean i didn't hate anybody else alive i can't i hear you all right let's go uh

[03:27:30]  you're trying to explain yourself uh i want to hear some what's the hat all right let's do it we  meet uh ray who was at the all-star parade all right so we're here outside the baseball parade with  ray ray what's the haps i can't hear you i said what's the haps you heard it today today today's  today's parade should be uh should be a big one and uh and hope the american league wins are you  emotional about the fact that this will be the last all-star game in the stadium yeah being affected  i was at the 177 unfortunately it can't be the one tonight but yeah i'm sorry to see i'm sorry to 
[03:28:00]  see the stadium go down but time's got to change and time for a new stadium don't you think it'll be  pretty much exactly the same at the new stadium uh it's probably gonna look better but it's gonna  take a while to get used to it ray doesn't have a job does he he's a principal in a high school in  the bronx poor ray yeah ray was just looking for some free fun these guys walk around new york city 
[03:28:30]  looking for free fun free fun man what's going on over here yeah then somebody comes up with a mic  and they figure i'll be on sports radio or something this is great and then they find out  it's what's the haps right with young sam roberts we got more ray so um have you been keeping up to  date with the latest uh with what's going on with obama uh no comment on that oh baseball i'm not i'm  not into politics no comment have you decided who you're going to vote for at all uh tell you  truth no as of today no i'm still still 50 50. but you're hoping the american league wins tonight 
[03:29:00]  yeah sure and i hope the yankees uh make it to the world series and and win number 27. all right  great well thanks a lot you're welcome yeah ray was a douche i've got a lot of wishes he had no  comment oh yeah what about that obama thing no comment no comment get these cameras out of my face big  important guy that he has no no one no one that is a of no importance no you should not ever say no 
[03:29:30]  comment plus he had a well-formulated opinion on who he wants to win the all-star game but couldn't  figure out who he wants to be the president yet yeah i love the people that are yeah they're  protecting their vote who they're voting for it's a secret ballot secret we have been given the right  to secret ballot like no one gives a fuck who you're voting for the nazis they're gonna come and  take you away if you have the wrong yes you voted for the wrong guy it's it's it's either that dope  or that dope right which which dope you're voting right exactly what are you what are you protecting  new poll just five percent of blacks have a favorable view of mccain among black voters obama 94 
[03:30:00]  mccain one percent now now don't try to bullshit me and tell me that they're not voting on racial lines  that is an absolute landslide black people are tired of uh white presidents no shit sorry  anyone else notice that mccain is the only white guy that his skin color is lighter than his white 
[03:30:30]  hair yeah that's amazing he has never seen that before yeah this is gonna be and that goes with what  i said earlier so you got 94 in favor of obama right obama yeah it's gonna be a lot of people  disappointed when they realize that things are not going to drastically right they're not you're  right they're not actually they're gonna be so disappointed of course somewhere around uh this  time next year they're gonna be like what the fuck every four years everyone expected that you know oh  it's gonna all change the world the house shut the up it's only um what three million people 
[03:31:00]  uh vote no no 300 million people in the country so you take uh 30 300 million people in the country  right so you take all right 30 million 10 or so is black is black i'd say 30 million  what i would say less no it's 10 it's between 10 and 12 oh it is okay yeah i'm sorry so 30 
[03:31:30]  my boy and if 99 of them voted it would just be a landslide uh but it's states yeah i know  it's not many you don't you don't really get your individual vote that's why republicans in new  york you could stay home yeah so you don't have to vote because it's always new york will always go  democrat and they will always give it to the democratic candidate we truly don't have a voice in new  york no obama wins new york it's when you go you go to the poll and you're like all right i'm voting 
[03:32:00]  republican and you pull the handle it doesn't mean shit right right because the state is going well  because they don't they didn't trust us with uh voting for the president in the end it's the electoral  college all right let's go uh back to the streets yeah we're in the middle of what's the haps what's  the haps who do we got next anthony oh yeah anthony i was down there it was and uh sam came up to me  and said what's the haps and uh you could hear this this sound of me punching him in his face right 
[03:32:30]  short all right so we're here at the baseball parade with anthony anthony what's the haps  the haps yeah what is the haps that's what i'm asking you i don't know what is the haps  the haps it means like what's happening it's like an abbreviation for what's happening oh well right now  is uh we're just waiting for the all-star game parade do you have any plans on who you're going  to vote for in the upcoming presidential election whether it's obama or mccain uh officially not  really but i'm leaning towards obama did you see the all the controversy all of a sudden with the 
[03:33:00]  picture of him uh on the new yorker what did you think it's kind of that's kind of low i don't know  why they did that kind of low yes low indeed i'm glad he was able to unofficially give his word though  sam this is terrific stuff you got uh from the street by the way oh thank you just amazing thank you  you don't buy that it was uh satirical not really no but they they may say it is but you know they  should have done it you know they should have thought about it twice uh what do you like about 
[03:33:30]  obama i think he's a different type of president you know he brings a big change you know even though  he's experienced he knows what he's doing and most of more most importantly he's all about values  what uh does the fact that he's black have anything to do with it not at all no no no  um and are you upset that the neon men aren't going to be on the new shea stadium are you glad  to see those uh terrible things go yeah i think that should you know be brought down with the shea 
[03:34:00]  stadium all right well thanks a lot i appreciate it no problem thanks what an idiot yeah that guy just  came off as an idiot yeah uh what what uh ethnic background was he he was spanish i think he was  spanish um voting for obama because he's all about values and different and he's different he's a  different president even though he's not elected yet right boy that guy was an idiot but everyone's  like that i know that's the majority of the country the reason for them voting is just always something  dumb oh boy here we go we meet uh non-specific colin what is this about well colin wouldn't take a 
[03:34:30]  stand on some of my first line of questioning ah you don't buy that it was uh satirical not really  no but they they may what happened we did that one already right yeah who could tell  that means you'd have to be paying attention well come on let's all right here's colin all right so
