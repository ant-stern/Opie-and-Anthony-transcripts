<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with technical difficulties in the studio, leading to speculation about sabotage.  Anthony then recounted a chaotic morning commute involving encounters with wildlife (deer, raccoon, fox) and a frustrating experience with a Bridge and Tunnel officer who issued him three tickets—for failing to signal, an expired registration (despite having the valid document), and a blinker violation—which Anthony believed was due to the officer recognizing him.  He discussed celebratory posts on the bridge and tunnel officers’ message board seemingly referencing him. The hosts then shifted to discussing a vague terrorist threat reported in the news, expressing frustration at the lack of specifics.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the potential firing of staff member Troy Kwan following an on-air argument, with Opie and Anthony strongly opposing his dismissal and criticizing the company's handling of the situation, mentioning unsuccessful attempts to speak with management, along with the recent departure of interns and anticipation for new ones.

The next segment focused on movie reviews and box office flops, particularly the poor performance of "R.I.P.D." and "Love Guru," with commentary on Jeff Bridges' and Mike Myers' involvement. They reminisced about past celebrity guests like Ben Stiller, Willem Dafoe, and Gary Oldman, discussing the films that prompted their appearances.  A significant portion was devoted to the Time Warner Cable/CBS dispute and the resulting channel blackouts, with the hosts expressing their dislike for Time Warner. The latter half delved into Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal and Sydney Leathers, featuring graphic and sexually explicit commentary about a video of Leathers.  They also discussed Elliot Spitzer's political comeback and Roger Clemens' return to the Yankees, including audio clips.

The third segment featured a humorous clip of Yankees broadcaster Susan Wallman's over-the-top reaction to a mundane baseball moment, which was repeatedly played and analyzed.  The hosts then provided a graphic, detailed, and explicit description of a pornographic video.  A lengthy discussion ensued about Don Ennis's gender transition, subsequent amnesia, and reversal, marked by incredulous commentary and speculation on his motivations.  A caller summarized Ennis's timeline, and A-Rod's baseball suspension was also briefly discussed. A caller shared a story about a transgender producer they knew. The segment concluded with commentary on Tom Hanks' hairline and speculation about hair transplants.

The fourth segment began with a discussion of Alex Rodriguez's press conference following his steroid suspension. Mike Francesa called in, expressing frustration and criticizing A-Rod's statements, culminating in a humorous "angry mic" moment where he emphatically declared A-Rod used steroids. The conversation then shifted to a humorous debate about the "greatest lesser brother of all time," mentioning Clint Howard, Frank Stallone, Don Swayze, Russell Simmons, Billy Carter, and Robert F. Kennedy. A clip of A-Rod being booed was played, followed by calculations of his financial losses due to the suspension. Actor Ty West then joined the show, discussing his roles in *You're Next* and *Drinking Buddies*, sharing anecdotes about filming and marketing horror films.  They discussed various horror films, including *The Conjuring*, *The Woodsman*, and *Active Killing*, with West providing a graphic description of the latter. The segment concluded with further discussion of West's career, Jimmy's upcoming Insane Clown Posse event and Comedy Central special (including a promotional video), and a behind-the-scenes discussion about internal company issues and the possible firing of a colleague.

The final segment, hosted solely by Sam Roberts, focused on the fallout from Troy's on-air incident, fielding listener calls speculating about the event and Troy's personality.  He emphasized that no one wished they had handled the situation differently.  The segment also discussed horror movies, specifically *The Conjuring*, with Sam recounting his YouTube review process.  Other news items covered included Rob Zombie's conflict with his neighbors and Jack White's legal battle with his ex-wife, including an email revealing his rivalry with the Black Keys' lead singer.  Listener calls addressed the Troy situation and horror movies.  Nicole from the "Morning Mashup" briefly appeared, discussing her marriage. The segment concluded with a discussion of "Anchor Management," the lack of off-air violence in Troy's character, and a Dollar Shave Club advertisement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's the dang open-handed, don't listen to the dang of him.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, good morning. 
[00:01:00]  What the heck is going on?  Huh?  Yes, yes.  You hear that?  What is it?  I hear us.  Oh my god.  Ew, it's us.  Ew.  Is Mars here today?  No.  Someone messed with the games.  What happened?  I...  Oh boy.  What are games?  Ah, this shit.  Oh man.  Does anyone know where they're usually?  No.  And why is people fiddling about?  People fiddle. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, someone messed with the games.  Ah.  What about the losses?  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ah.  Your mic sounds fine?  Yeah, now it sounds fine.  Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.  Whoa.  Someone messed with the games.  Can someone call Mars and ask about the settings?  Why would they do that?  I noticed that this wasn't set up like it usually is either.  Oh no.  Nice.  Yeah, that... 
[00:02:00]  The keyboard out.  Yeah, that has to go down.  The keyboards are on here.  Yeah.  The keyboards are back.  Why are the keyboards...  The keyboards are back.  The keyboards are back.  Why are the keyboards back?  I don't know.  Mine was...  Why?  One was out in front of me this morning.  I had to toss it to the side again, so I don't know...  Why are they back?  Why is that mouse back?  Who uses the side running face?  And then this whole screen was turned around.  Yeah.  That means nothing to anybody, but whatever.  Someone else is here.  Yeah.  Yeah, who's in here?  Who's sneaking around when we're not here? 
[00:02:30]  Someone's sneaking.  We've got to put a lock on the door.  We'll still blow our nose.  Jesus, why is everyone sneezing?  I woke up with like a tickle in my left nostril.  Right.  And it's making me...  Uh-huh.  Whoa, that's weird.  Jesus.  I'm trying to figure out...  Okay.  That's perfect.  I'm trying to figure out the setting on my mic.  Oh, no.  Because whoever the fuck was in here fucked...  Oh, shit.  That ain't it.  I don't think you're supposed to push these buttons. 
[00:03:00]  These buttons.  That wasn't it.  Oh, my God.  Is this good?  No.  That is so fucked up now.  What do you mean?  I think this is really, really powerful.  That's fine, yeah.  I think it's really, really good.  Why isn't that like a good setting?  How about this?  Yeah.  That's nothing.  Actually, that's way better.  How about...  Why'd you leave it there?  All right. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  I'll figure it out.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  How about this?  Oh.  Ooh.  Fuck.  I feel like I'm on crystal meth.  I drove from the beach house.  It's a two-hour commute.  It's a wake up at four and get the fuck in the car immediately.  And start driving like a maniac.  Well, you can't drive like a maniac because you've got to leave the beach area.  So you have to drive 20 miles an hour.  And I'm in such an isolated area that the cops followed me out because they're like,  holy fuck, why is someone driving at four in the morning? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  They assume you're fucking shady.  They assume that I decided to bury a body on the beach and now I'm getting the hell out of Dodge.  Yeah.  I think you're really loud now.  Huh?  I think you're...  I turned it down.  I told you I feel like I'm on fucking drugs.  I don't know.  How's that?  There we go.  But I have the same gain as you.  Yeah?  You must have a more powerful voice.  No.  All right.  So then the cops follow you out because they're like, you have to be up to no good if you're 
[00:04:30]  driving around this area at four in the morning.  Yeah.  And then you finally get to another country road where now you're dodging deer.  Dodging.  This is what I saw today.  A raccoon.  Ooh.  Many deer, including a baby deer.  A lot.  And for the first time, a red fox.  Oh.  And a sort of cats and stuff.  But we see cats all the time.  So who gives a fuck?  Domestic animals, aren't they?  They don't count.  And then you finally get on the LIE.  And I was telling Anthony, it is the sickest rush hour you could ever have at five in the 
[00:05:00]  morning.  Now, officially, that's not rush hour.  But it's all the other assholes driving back to the city from faraway lands.  So everyone's going 80, 85 miles an hour, making ridiculous moves.  And you see everybody is holding a hot cup of coffee in their right hand, driving with  their left hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Everyone's trying to beat the next guy.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Go a little faster.  And I'm going to make an announcement. 
[00:05:30]  Someone will die on the LIE in the HOV lane.  Oh.  This is maybe too local for people.  But they decide they need to do that midnight to 5 a.m. construction.  And they close lanes.  Yeah.  And so I'm going about 70 in the HOV lane.  And I have to come to an abrupt stop because the construction crews are now getting rid  of all the overnight construction shit.  Yeah.  But there's no sign that they're up ahead.  So you have to quickly jam on the brakes.  Then all the cars back up. 
[00:06:00]  And now you have to cross the HOV double lane crap to get back on the regular LIE.  And people are screaming.  They're screaming by you at 80 miles an hour.  And there's no spots, meaning no spots to get in.  Yeah.  So I see people just like fucking hedging their bets and poking their nose out.  Someone's going to get smeared on the LIE in the HOV lane trying to get back into traffic.  Yeah.  Because now you've got to go from zero to highway speed with absolutely no on-ramp type. 
[00:06:30]  No on-ramp and no room to get in.  There's absolutely no room to get in.  Oh, man.  And people start getting frustrated, so they start hedging.  And then you get people just screaming by you, beeping like lunatics, because they're like,  what the fuck are you doing?  Why would they do that?  The system sucks.  And I'm telling you, someone's going to get smeared.  Yeah.  On the LIE in the HOV lane around five in the morning when they try to get rid of the construction.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Good morning, everybody. 
[00:07:00]  Good morning.  How's everyone?  Good morning.  How's everyone?  I'm all right.  You all right?  Yeah.  Everyone's sneezing?  I know.  My nose is fucking like...  I'm not sneezing.  I had that little sinus thing last week, so I've been just blowing my nose a lot for the  last week, but I don't have a cold.  Did that work out for you?  I don't know.  It feels okay.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  The left one's still a little clogged, but...  A little clogged.  Yeah, and I'm like, I'm a little cloggy today.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  Breathe. 
[00:07:30]  Just breathe deep, the gathering gloom.  Lost lights fade from every room.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I played that song a million fucking times.  Bet you did.  Moody blues.  Well, I had some adventure and excitement on the way in yesterday.  I heard.  They finally got you, huh?  They finally got me.  How did they get you?  I wasn't able to listen.  Eh, this fucking guy was there at the booth.  Waiting for you?  I don't know.  I think it was...  What would you do wrong? 
[00:08:00]  I think it was waiting for someone.  Get this.  I...  I...  He stopped me right at the gate.  Right.  You know how they stand there sometimes looking for seatbelts and things like that?  Well, I have everything on and everything.  But he pulls me over and he goes, you didn't signal when you changed lanes to get...  You know when you pull into a toll plaza and you pick your lane to go in through the...  Right.  No one signals...  That's what they got you for?  Yes.  I didn't signal as I was picking and choosing my fucking toll lane. 
[00:08:30]  It goes from three lanes to now you got eight options, whatever the fuck.  And all you do is look for the open one or the one with less cars and you go.  Yeah.  But I saw his face.  He was like thrilled.  He knew it was me at that point.  He's been looking for me, this guy.  And...  Seriously?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So every day he knows your license plate?  He knew the Escalade.  He knew what I looked like.  So every time he sees an Escalade, he's making sure you're driving perfectly.  I think so.  And I think...  Well, he was there looking for people that were fucking up. 
[00:09:00]  He wasn't there looking for me specifically.  But when I pulled up, he must have been like, oh, there's that fuck.  Was it Mustache Joe?  It was Goatee Guy.  Goatee.  Goatee Guy.  Goatee Charlie.  Yeah, yeah.  He's there too.  So he nailed me there.  He got me for...  My registration in the window.  Right.  It's expired, but I have the good one.  Everyone lets that shit laugh. 
[00:09:30]  I know.  And then you take care of it when you finally get your dumb ticket.  It's right there on my fucking counter.  Insurance.  I always know when my inspection sticker is due when I get the ticket.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, oops.  And then my insurance also.  And I was bitching yesterday about it.  Like, these days, your insurance card expires every fucking week and a half, it seems like.  Right.  And then you got to get a new one.  I have insurance.  It's no problem.  And then the blinker got me for that.  So he wrote me three tickets. 
[00:10:00]  Three tickets?  Yes.  And then as he gave it to me and he was leaving, I went, excuse me, you're screwing with me, right?  I go, you're screwing with me.  I go, first of all, these two.  And I held up the two tickets.  I go, they're done.  I'm just going to show them my stuff.  And I go, the blinker one?  I go, I'm just going to say that that NYPD van that was kind of in front of me.  Veered over to his lane and pushed me into that lane.  And that's why I didn't signal.  And I go, that's getting thrown out.  I go, so you're screwing with me, right?  He goes, you're free to leave, sir.  I go, you're screwing.  I go, just stay with me.  Oh, fucking assholes.  You're free to go, sir. 
[00:10:30]  And he's smirking at me.  So I'm like, all right.  Well, apparently, the message board there, the transit, the bridge and tunnel cop message board was alight last night.  Really?  It was alight last night with a celebration that the big bad ogre, Anthony, was gotten.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Please don't give him my license plate number.  Because I'm commuting that way for a while.  Please don't.  So, really?  What was the...  I gave out the thing and it jammed up the whole fucking message board. 
[00:11:00]  Good for you.  Yeah.  And, well, one of my buddies is a cop.  He's on that message board and was just taunting them and making fun of them.  But what was...  But they were...  Oh, they were so happy.  What was the title of the threat?  I don't know.  I'm an asshole or something.  Be on the lookout.  Bolo.  Bolo.  Bolo.  Yeah.  So, they were getting me.  But here's what I'm going to do.  Obviously, you know, I'll put the reggie in my window. 
[00:11:30]  And I'm completely illegal.  I am just going to fucking ask them every morning when I go through.  I think I'm going to go through the cash lane.  Just so I could stop and ask them.  Hi.  Hey.  Did you clean the tunnel out today?  Did you pick up any garbage?  Is that anything?  What else is your job?  Do you ever really do anything cop-like?  Or do you just make change?  Like, I could say that.  I could just fuck with him.  As long as I'm not in his little fucking thousand yards of jurisdiction. 
[00:12:00]  It's a thousand yards of jurisdiction?  I don't even think it's that much.  It's probably 500.  The plaza.  He's fucking sheriff of the plaza.  Look out.  I'm just going to fuck with them.  Every day.  I just want to announce that I drive a smart car, if you're looking for them.  Oh.  I drive a smart car, yes.  What assholes.  Yeah, they were obviously on the lookout.  Well, we all knew they were on the lookout.  Be on the lookout.  I want to see what my buddy said.  Wait, how the fuck did they get you, though?  Why wouldn't you just keep going? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, he waved me over.  Because they stand there.  They stand there.  And he gets in front of your car.  They stand there and they look like cops, but they're not cops.  Or are they sort of cops?  They're sort of cops.  They have the jurisdiction.  But guns have?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they got their guns.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They made a comment.  Oh, they started making comments about the task force or something.  Because that's the one they're always trying to get into, but they can't because they suck. 
[00:13:00]  So he replies, first off, it's fugitive task force.  Look into it.  And then put out another bolo for horn honking.  Put out a be on the lookout for someone honking their horn.  Ew.  Why?  Oh, they're serious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I guess they were asking me things.  Yeah.  And I got the username and password for the message board from somebody I know.  So I could get on there and start fucking wreaking havoc.  It's just a fun little hobby. 
[00:13:30]  Jesus.  I guess people are trashing their little message board.  Yeah.  So, you know, I guess that battle's over.  It's not over.  Nothing's over.  It's never over.  It's never over.  Never.  Just what a pain.  Like, really?  You're going to fucking, for a blinker not being used in a toll plaza.  Who uses their blinker when you're picking your fucking little toll slot lane?  I've never seen anyone use a blinker.  I've never seen it.  Every time I do.  No, you don't, Jimmy. 
[00:14:00]  And when are you supposed to use the blinker?  Yeah, right.  It's like a funnel.  Yeah, yeah.  So what do you mean?  Where's the lane you were in, technically?  That's just it.  It doesn't...  Where was the lane you were in?  You're not technically changing the lane.  It's turning into three lanes.  It's turning into eight.  Eight lanes, right.  So each lane is turning into another couple of lanes.  He fucking...  Yeah.  It was so ridiculous at that point.  He probably had a huge heart on it.  Oh, did he?  He was loving it.  And he couldn't wait to tell the boy.  He made me wait there, too. 
[00:14:30]  Like, you could tell I was there much longer than it took to write his dumb tickets out.  And then he started yelling at me at one point, too.  He goes, roll your windows down and wait here.  And then he's like, roll your windows down!  And I'm like, that's as far as they go down.  You know, the Escalade rear window doesn't fucking roll down all the way.  Why is he getting so mad when it was just a dumb blinker, dude?  He was just fucking with me.  He was taking his little bit of authority that the bridge and tunnel cops have and fucking with me. 
[00:15:00]  Using that authority to fuck with me.  I said I knew what it was like yesterday to feel like a black young man.  Oh, you were profiled.  I was profiled.  I was singled out.  And the cops were the cop of fucking fake cops.  And you were unregistered.  And you had no insurance.  Yes, exactly.  Oh, fuck.  That sucks.  Yeah, yeah.  So, uh...  I'm just gonna... 
[00:15:30]  I'm gonna taunt.  I'm gonna taunt when I go through.  Not to any, you know...  No threats.  No...  Nothing dangerous or anything.  I'm just gonna spark up a little chat with them every time I go through that toll now.  Can you tape it?  Oh, absolutely.  Nice.  I told him he's gotta have two GoPros.  Of course.  One facing where it gets him and the window.  Oh, yeah.  You gotta get that.  Of course.  Yeah, you gotta make sure you get the fuck it.  So you can see your blinker.  You can see your speedometer.  So, are you looking for any excitement today?  As a law enforcement officer? 
[00:16:00]  You know, breaking a 50?  What's the big...  What's the big thing happens here at the plaza?  Huh?  You can't make change?  Freaking out?  You think they're still happy?  They won't be.  Are they still happy today?  Oh, they're probably still gloating.  Really?  Hey, how about that?  They're probably patting them on the back.  Good job.  Like, it's like if a real cop did something big.  Right.  Like, caught somebody who was planting a bomb. 
[00:16:30]  Or a terrorist.  Yeah, a terrorist.  Some more kind of shit.  Or thwarted a robbery or something like that.  Right.  This guy's being pat on the back.  Probably his fucking captain came down to the plaza.  Hey, I heard you got Cumia there.  You think you got a little...  The plaza, good job.  You think you got a little stripe or something?  You got a little ribbon for his fucking uniform?  Maybe a ribbon, right.  Right.  A ribbon that's going to fall off his uniform?  Of course.  Because it's going to...  When you drive by him too fast?  Yeah, it falls off his uniform. 
[00:17:00]  His badge gets all tarnished from the exhaust fumes of the toll.  No law enforcement officer should double as a toll taker.  You see him there?  They don't just stand there as the law guy.  They stand there also literally taking the tolls like a chick.  Like a bitch.  In their little fucking toll booth.  You got to make sure he doesn't know what bothered you.  Yeah, it's a little too late.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oops.  It did bother me because he used his menial little bit of authority to fuck with me personally. 
[00:17:30]  It was a personal thing.  So if you fight it, does he have to go to court?  Yep.  Oh, fuck.  Fight it.  Oh, I will.  I will.  And then he'll leave a smile and laugh at him and go, ha ha, you're wasting a day here.  He probably likes it, though, because it gets him out of the fucking exhaust fumes of the  toll plaza for the day.  But, no, I will.  And I'll get all three tickets taken care of.  And I'll fucking just be like, yeah, that worked out well, didn't it? 
[00:18:00]  Like when the murderer got off the hook and he had to get in the elevator with Harry Callahan.  And Dirty Harry was like, fuck technicality.  Yeah, punk.  And when you get off, you got to make sure you wait for him at the toll plaza and show.  Hey, remember that nonsense you gave me that day?  How you doing?  I'll use my blinker.  I'll go into the fucking, I'll use my blinker and go into the one that he's in.  Be like, hey, how you doing there, pally?  And he'll be telling us his mafia chief. 
[00:18:30]  And he smiled at me.  He smiled.  He stood there like a fool.  I suspended the sentence.  Did he see you this morning?  No, I stayed in the city.  I was hunkering down.  I went to the mattresses.  He's holding up.  I holed up.  I was on the lam.  You're scared.  No, I stayed in the city.  You're scared.  I'm scared.  I'm definitely taking the Queensborough Bridge home.  I don't blame you.  Assholes.  Until I get my Reggie back in the window.  Well, it brings up a bigger topic, man. 
[00:19:00]  These people that have just a little authority and then they act like they're the fucking,  you know, the kings of the world.  It was literally him using his authority for a personal vendetta against me.  It was a personal thing.  And he's in a position where he can do something.  And obviously he picked you out of nowhere.  I mean, it wasn't like you're...  All right, look.  I may have hit the gas and whipped around him one day. 
[00:19:30]  But again, I said I didn't want to...  I didn't want to have him dress me down.  Absolutely.  It wasn't anything.  I beeped my horn at a car that was stopped in front of me, a minivan, when the gate was up.  And like, why wouldn't he move?  So I went, bam!  And then the guy peeks out from in front of the minivan.  He was standing there.  Old goatee shithead was standing there.  And he had stopped the minivan.  I didn't know this. 
[00:20:00]  And then once the minivan went, he went to wave me over, not to give me a ticket or anything,  but to fucking just go, and you don't beep your horn when we're...  I don't need to be fucking dressed down by some cocksucker when I'm fucking just beeping for that reason.  Absolutely.  Why would you obey the direct orders of a police officer?  Oh, it's not a cop.  So why don't you have a beer summit?  What?  It's obviously a misunderstanding.  Fuck him.  This isn't going to end well.  What?  This isn't going to end well. 
[00:20:30]  This is one of those little things that just starts off as like, he beeped the horn.  Right.  And the next thing you know, there's carnage.  Hatfields and McCoys.  And he comes in here day after day.  He got me again.  No.  He got me again.  He's going to...  No, because once I put that fucking Reggie in the window where it belongs, there's nothing he can do.  I'm fucking legal.  I don't want you to be confused.  I'm on your side.  I'm Team Anthony.  Yeah.  But I am praying that you come in here a few more times.  With just a stack of tickets at some point. 
[00:21:00]  With a, he got me again.  He's going to be like an old Southern sheriff.  Take his billy club and break my taillight.  You got a light out, boy.  Looks like your windshield wipers are broken, too.  Ah, shit.  He got me again.  He got me again.  Fuck.  He got me.  Apparently, my tire tread didn't cover up Lincoln's head on the fucking...  Right.  Eh.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Make sure he doesn't drop some, you know, drugs or anything.  Oh, my God, right? 
[00:21:30]  You see he drops a fucking bag of Coke in my car.  I would have cameras on all the time when you're going through those toll booths.  Oh, my God.  I don't trust anybody.  What do we got here?  Right.  What the fuck?  What do you mean, what the...  What do we got here?  What a kilo of heroin in your vehicle?  No!  And then you hear the...  The dogs come...  Get out of the ground!  Oh, my God, it turns into a fucking 30-year prison stint just because you beeped and swerved  around the fucking asshole. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, man, that would suck.  It would suck and be hilarious all at the same time.  Oh, no, I don't find the hilarious part.  Let's go to Beer Summer.  Let's get this over with.  You think...  Yeah, let's move on.  We ought to take care of this?  Sure.  Yeah.  I can't leave it like this.  He got me.  I got to get him.  I got to mock him.  You beeped at him.  You evaded capture.  You mocked him publicly.  And then he just got you on two shitty tickets.  He didn't get you on a real thing.  I wish he would have written his name better on my ticket.  I can't even fucking say who it is. 
[00:22:30]  Of course not.  What's going to be a failure to signal?  It's nothing.  He did that on purpose.  I know.  Oh, he did, definitely.  He doesn't want you to know his name.  Oh, well.  Cock second.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  Hey, Joe.  He's got to sit there in the exhaust fumes every morning.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  Fuck.  I saw Mustache Joe.  Because I heard that he got the ticket.  So I was looking.  I was trying to figure out which guy really has it out for you.  He's some weaselly looking Irish dude with kind of a reddish goat. 
[00:23:00]  A reddish goatee.  Yeah.  I'll give him the finger tomorrow morning.  Yeah.  Because I'm incognito.  There you go.  In my smart car.  Are you going to make like you're scratching your cheek or adjusting your mirror?  I'll give him right to the fucking face.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  So I haven't been on the air in a few days.  Do you guys talk about the terrorist warning?  Why won't they let us know like if we should be going into subways or on buses? 
[00:23:30]  You mean the chatter?  They've heard chatter?  Or maybe we shouldn't be eating outdoors.  Or maybe we shouldn't be in a mall.  Just go about your business or the terrorists win.  I hate these fucking people.  The terrorists win if you don't go about your business.  But there's like an inside club.  Yeah.  Who knows where not to go?  Yeah.  There's an inside club on the news hinting that there's a terrorist warning.  They feel really good about the info they're getting.  The chatter they're getting.  They're saying this is on the level of 9-11. 
[00:24:00]  But they won't tell us what to stay the fuck away from.  Go about your business.  But they know.  Yeah.  So why aren't they telling us?  Exactly.  What?  Don't go to Europe?  Europe, don't broadcast from a high-rise like we're doing right now.  Imagine if the guy slipped past us in a truck or something while the guy was giving me a ticket for a blinker. 
[00:24:30]  God damn it.  I didn't think of that one.  You're absolutely right.  He would have gotten the guy.  Right.  But he's busy giving me a ticket for a blinker.  Right.  When he should be taking care of business.  Right.  So you're honking.  You're beginning this war with this peaceable officer may have doomed this city.  Don't you kiss their ass, Jimmy Norton.  Dude, I don't.  Please.  I don't drive.  Me and my BMW, they can do whatever they want. 
[00:25:00]  You.  But what should we be looking out for?  I don't know.  It's creepy, right?  White vans.  Why are they so pompous?  Why do they know we're not allowed to?  What is that about?  They always know just enough where they can't give you any fucking thing that will help you at all.  All weekend on those news shows, they're like, oh, this is strong.  This threat is really strong.  This is on the level of 9-11.  The chatter is strong.  We feel confident.  All right.  But what?  Strong chatter. 
[00:25:30]  Am I allowed to go in the ocean today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's kind of scary, I think.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, is that, um, what's that?  Email.  Oh, I thought it was a message board.  Oh, no.  I can't get on that message board.  Oh, okay.  And the other thing.  I wish.  I know.  And it has to be brought up, but Troy Kwan is like, like, maybe fired, maybe not fired.  And I was on the phone.  All of us were on the phone with Scott Greenstein and Steve Blatter and whoever the fuck would 
[00:26:00]  listen to us.  Yeah.  And none of us want him fired.  No.  No one.  And I think there's some weird tug of war going on upstairs because they're having meetings.  You know, I basically told Scott Greenstein, I personally called in a favor.  I'm like, look, I can vouch for the guy.  We don't want him fucking fired.  He does very good work for us.  Yeah.  It was an unfortunate on-air fight that went a little too far, but Troy Kwan even admitted  it went a little too far and that he doesn't, he's not going to hurt anybody. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  He's not going to harm anybody.  And his track record, he's been here for years making shitty money and the guy shouldn't  be fired.  They should do something else.  Yeah.  He's not officially fired, but it's weird that he's still, you know, he's suspended without  pay.  And we don't get any kind of, they've not given us any info.  And Greenstein, when I got him on the phone, he basically said, you know, the company wants  to fire this guy.  We want him fired.  I'm like, slow the fuck down.  Let's talk about this. 
[00:27:00]  I said, look, you know, the type of radio show we do, we get really edgy.  There's been a million horrible fights on this fucking radio show.  Why is that one worse than the others?  And the guys are trained to make it more, you know what I mean?  It's that people know that we're going to replay it the next day.  Troy knows what's expected of him when he comes.  How many times has he walked in here kind of with a smirk on his face?  Right.  So what, you don't like Denny?  No, I don't like him.  And he goes right in.  It's like he understands what kind of his role is here.  And it just got a little bit too much of the day. 
[00:27:30]  After the heated fight with Mark Zito, where I would absolutely admit it went a little  too far.  Yeah.  But I also went home that day thinking nothing of it.  Like, I know Troy didn't mean any of the shit he was saying.  He went on Ron and Fez immediately after the fight, basically, with a calmer head, explaining  everything to Ron.  Yeah.  You know, and that should have been the end of it.  And then I reminded Scott Greenstein of the time Bubba Love Sponge wanted to fucking punch  me in the fucking face.  He said he's coming up to New York just to punch me in the fucking face. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  And he also encouraged his listeners to punch me in the fucking face.  I think that's way worse than what Troy did.  Yeah.  Because he was getting listeners involved and shit.  I was a little concerned.  But then also, but I also know how radio works.  So I knew it was going to be okay in the end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No one has any, no one has any thoughts that Troy is going to do anything.  But I think, like, Scott sort of hinted that, you know, he's going to save him. 
[00:28:30]  But then I think there's lawyers involved and HR involved upstairs.  So I think I really, I talked to Troy yesterday.  Because he's trying to figure out what the hell's going on.  I go, I think there's a weird tug of war going on right now.  Because Scott fully understands that none of us on this, on this show want Troy quantified.  There's not one person.  No.  Not at all.  So, you know.  No one ever, no one thinks Troy's going to do anything violent to anybody around here.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:29:00]  They have these zero tolerance policies where, you know.  Right.  Oh, if you do, they don't even look at, like, the context of anything.  Here's what happens.  All right.  We do this.  Or the winking that's going on.  Like, look, I'm really fucking pumping this up for the radio show right now.  Right.  And people are loving it.  I'm getting people talking for you guys.  Yeah.  For the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This didn't happen in the broom closet.  This was on the air.  On the air.  On the air, which we always thought was a safe place.  And we tell them it's a safe place.  Yeah.  We always tell the guys on the staff, hey, man, say what you want as long as it's on the 
[00:29:30]  air.  Right.  Yeah.  If it was in an office down the hall, different story.  Much different story.  But it wasn't.  I feel like I talked Scott out of, you know, having Troy fired, but now I haven't heard  anything in a few days.  And I heard they had a meeting yesterday, and I think there's some weird tug of war going  on.  Because I don't trust the lawyers at all.  They never make the right decision.  They just get, they just fucking, you know, pull the trigger way too quickly.  And get rid of, you know, talented people that fucked up. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, he fucked up.  I don't think he fucked up as far as our show goes, but from a company standpoint, yeah, sure,  I guess he fucked up.  But not to the point where he should lose his livelihood.  Well, me and Jimmy talked to Scott yesterday, and, oh, that's right, we didn't.  He wouldn't see us.  Oh, that's right.  We were summarily dismissed.  Why?  At the door.  Who knows?  You're kidding.  Oh, no.  We walked up to the office.  Right.  We were waiting there, because he was in his office with somebody.  I had gone at 9 o'clock to see, can you tell him that I want to come by at 10 for 
[00:30:30]  five minutes?  Right.  Because I was gone.  I know he wasn't here Friday either, but.  Right.  I said at 10.  Now, I did get a call from Bladder about that.  So me and Anthony, I'm sorry, go ahead and tell him that.  We went down there.  We went down there.  We were going to, you know, go into the office in five minutes.  Yeah, make it clear.  Plead our case for Troy.  And he pokes out, he goes, yeah, yeah, I can't do this.  I got it.  I got it, though.  Opie told me everything that needs to be told.  This is this.  I got it. 
[00:31:00]  I got it.  I got it.  And pretty much treated us like a board op for the 60s channel.  And just like.  This is pretty serious.  He should have met with you guys for five minutes yesterday.  Dismissed.  He was in a meeting with.  Yeah, but he could have said, could you wait 15 minutes?  I agree.  20 minutes, whatever the fuck.  He was in a meeting with a chief financial officer.  So they were doing something.  Right.  And Blatter called me later that day.  And he said, look, I asked about it.  And he said the reason he did that.  And I still am furious.  But this was his explanation. 
[00:31:30]  Was that, no, no, I had it.  I knew what you guys wanted.  But it wasn't the fact that we didn't get to talk to him.  It was just.  And Anthony felt it, too.  It was like.  It was like, hey, these two jerk offs are bothering me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were dismissed.  It's like, hey, sorry.  There's a major thing going on with our show.  And management always complains.  Hey, you guys don't come to us.  So we calmly go down.  Yeah.  And then we're treated like two jerk offs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why would we ever go down there?  Oh, Christ.  Yeah.  That was great.  No one.  I'm going to reiterate.  No one on the Opie and Anthony show wants Troy fired at all. 
[00:32:00]  Because we all understand how this shit works.  Okay.  It went a little far.  Yes.  But not to the point where Troy would do anything outside this fucking studio or even inside  the studio.  There's been times he knows that he can't touch anybody.  We all know that.  Right.  And, you know, the show's in a good place right now.  And this would be a real fucking bummer.  A real bummer for everybody.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Human resources has a job to do.  And it's like, at times what they do is...  Do they?  Yeah.  I mean, they stop women from being...  They stop certain things from happening.  Stop women from being sexy.  But they...  But they...  I get it.  They have a job to do.  And they're the line between the corporation, and this is any company, and lawsuits.  That's what their thing is.  I don't get it.  And I never will, Jimmy, because...  I'm sorry.  I don't...  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I mean, I do get why they're...  I apologize.  I do get why they're there.  Right.  But they overextend, and they read into like this. 
[00:33:00]  They have to understand the context of the show they're dealing with.  It's like, your job is to stop certain problems from happening.  And we...  All right.  That's your function.  Yeah.  This is not one of those problems.  This was an on-air thing that got made more because it's on-air, and both guys know they're  being listened to.  You have to take that into consideration.  This is not an argument that you overheard in the copy room.  Right.  I have a real problem with HR being involved with entertainment companies, period.  I've been on the radio since I was 18.  I've been around edgy radio for a really long fucking time. 
[00:33:30]  And for many years, I don't even...  Did AF have HR?  I don't think so.  And I don't even think any W did at first.  No, it was just the GM and shit.  It was the GM and stuff.  And somewhere along the line, these companies decide they need a human resource department.  Yeah.  I'm here to say, I spent many, many years on the radio, around edgy radio, never seeing  any real fucking problems where you would need human resources to come in and clean things  up.  Right.  So with that said, then you bring in a human resource department, and you bring in some 
[00:34:00]  of these fucking lawyers, and they start seeing problems that aren't there in the end.  Because they have to justify their job.  They're not...  There's no problem with Troy Kwan.  Yeah.  They have to justify their job.  But they are seeing problems that just aren't there.  Because if they're just...  If no problems happen for a protracted period of time, then people will go, do we really  need this department? 
[00:34:30]  Right.  Let's cut back.  So they make problems.  Right.  They make way more problems than solve problems.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's the problem I have with those people.  I don't even know who the HR lady is.  I have no idea.  Puffin stuff.  I have no desire to ever meet her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't...  It's never good when you have to deal with them.  It's never good.  No.  Because it seems like they never will err on the side of, oh, okay, I get it.  Right.  That's a part of the culture of the radio show.  And this wouldn't happen on the show I listen to. 
[00:35:00]  But on your show, it's understandable how two guys would yell at each other like that,  and then shake hands after, or they could see each other in the hallway, and never,  ever have an issue.  Yeah.  It's like, they don't know the difference between that and the guy that comes in in military  fatigues because his ex-wife is cheating on him.  Right.  There's a great difference between those two people in the workplace.  Yeah.  We live in a very, very different world in this studio.  Very different.  Than even most of, I would say, just about every other show here at SiriusXM.  I mean, the only other show would be Howard. 
[00:35:30]  It's us and Howard that live in a really strange world where there are going to be crazy on-air  fights.  Never a fist fight.  Certainly not on satellite radio.  Right.  We had fist fights at N.E.W., and even those worked themselves out.  Yeah.  But this isn't the 60s channel or all these other fucking, the morning mashup and all  that crap.  This is a much different world.  And we should be graded as such.  So, I just had to get that off our chest because, you know, no one out there knows what's going 
[00:36:00]  on.  And it's time they do.  Yeah.  We wait here now to fucking see what happens.  But I think there's some weird fucking tug of war going on.  I think Scott heard us loud and clear, but I think he's probably getting the ear of the  lawyers and HR, and it's just a thing that is happening.  So, I just wanted to reiterate once again that there's not a person on our staff that  wants fucking Troy fired.  And there's not a person on the staff that thinks Troy would ever do anything. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Anything.  Especially outside the studio.  Well, that's a good idea.  Fucking hashtag.  Justice for Traquan.  Well, you were there.  Sam was there.  It's like, you knew it wasn't getting crazy.  You would have stopped.  Obviously, you've been in the studio a million times during things.  He's an irresponsible broadcaster.  You've seen almost everything that happened in here.  And you know the vibe of when two guys are just, you know what's going on.  Yeah.  I mean, I told everybody that I had to tell.  I would have stopped it in a heartbeat if there was any threat of actual violence. 
[00:37:00]  Irresponsible broadcasting.  You think that's what it was?  Sam Roberts is at fault.  You were the captain of the ship that day.  You had the con.  You had the helm.  Have there been any threats of violence in this studio before?  No.  Never won.  Not a one.  Not a one.  Not a one.  Not a one.  Not a one.  Not a one.  I don't even think there's ever been real threats.  We've talked a lot of shit in here.  Yeah.  I can't think of any time.  Yeah.  I had a fucking fight with Jesse Ventura in here.  Right.  I had a fairly nasty argument with Chris Jericho.  Right. 
[00:37:30]  And neither time, I mean, with Jesse, that last moment, I got like a little worried.  When wrestlers.  Jesus.  But it was really weird.  Like, you never think, oh no, there's going to be an explosion of...  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Because you understand that we're both talking to a microphone, and everyone involved kind  of gets that.  Mm-hmm.  There's literally been staff members that say, I want to punch you in the face.  I want to cave your head in.  Right.  Oh, definitely, yeah.  And it never happens, though.  Yeah.  And people bring it up.  I mean, they're fans of radio.  You know, this guy, Pat on Long Island, already on Stern's show, tried to punch someone and 
[00:38:00]  never got fired.  That was another incident.  Well, that's a whole different animal over there, you know.  Obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're shit.  We're pieces of shit.  Yeah, we're shit compared to that.  Left at the door.  Right.  Because, you know, Bubba was allowed to fucking threaten me.  Because Bubba was connected to Stern at the time.  So.  Yeah, they didn't do anything to Bubba.  They did nothing.  I even sent, I sent the audio clips to Scott going, hey, remember this?  Yeah.  And then I didn't cry like a bitch to any lawyers or human resources, by the way. 
[00:38:30]  But I said, remember this, because I'm trying to save Troy.  I'm like, you do remember this, right?  The guy threatened to fucking come up from Florida, which he never did, by the way.  Of course he didn't.  To punch me in the fucking face.  Yeah.  And then when he was too fucking lazy to, you know, get up to New York, he told his listeners  to do it.  Yeah.  That wasn't a problem, obviously, for the company whatsoever.  So why is this a problem?  Hmm.  So.  Ridiculous. 
[00:39:00]  We'll see what happens.  Hmm.  But the silence, I don't think is good.  At all.  Yeah.  I think there's a weird tug of war going on.  And we're not being unreasonably defending someone just because they're a part of it.  There's been people who've been let go from this show that nobody on the show said anything  about because at the time we felt like it was the right move.  Like, we don't just run in and blindly defend every person that's let go.  Right.  Hey, you can't let them.  There's been times where they made decisions that were like, all right, you got to do it,  you got to do it.  Yeah.  So it's not like we unreasonably fucking scream and yell every time they want somebody. 
[00:39:30]  This is just not right.  It's the wrong decision to make.  He's a great worker.  He's not.  I've been on the road with him in fucking crowd situations.  He's fucking great, man.  The guy's great.  We just got back from Montreal only a couple days before the fight.  He was unbelievable up there.  He did everything we asked of him.  Yeah.  Everything.  Even shitty little dumb jobs.  Yeah.  And there's nobody, the gathering is this weekend.  There's nobody, I'm not going with anybody else.  Oh, Sam.  It's not about you.  Oh, no. 
[00:40:00]  What about me?  No, meaning Troy is the guy.  I know.  That you would have went with.  You don't want Iraq to go with you?  Yeah, Iraq could step up and go to the gathering with you.  Iraq gets easily distracted on trips.  Iraq, that's true.  Sure is.  Pin off mic.  Sure is.  Are you going to the gathering this weekend?  No, I'm not going.  Why not?  We might need you to.  I wasn't asked.  Yes, your story made no sense.  Oh, I would go.  Did you see?  This is what Jackie's dealing with on the phone.  She's going, yeah, your story made no sense. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, thank you.  Because, yeah, I'm on Twitter and I'm reminded of something.  And I got a message for Fez from Ron and Fez.  Troy's not going to do anything to you.  So stop with the nonsense.  Okay?  I think he knows, doesn't he?  Yeah, he stopped.  Did he stop?  Yeah.  I think they actually went back, both of them, and said,  if there's anything we can do to help him.  No, I think those guys actually stepped up.  Stop with the nonsense.  I don't think he's after it.  He was scared to come up here for a few days.  Stop.  Seriously, stop. 
[00:41:00]  It's not helping the cause.  You're on the Opie and Anthony channel.  We're trying to save a guy.  And we had Fez for a few days scared to come up here  because he thought Troy was going to do something to him.  Oh, no.  There's not one person that thought Troy was going to do anything to you, Fez.  Oh, no.  I don't give a fuck.  Enough already.  Oh, no.  But it worked itself out?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think those guys went back and said, do we need to write a letter?  Like, I think they were actually proactive.  Who?  Ron Enfez.  I think we're actually proactive.  Okay.  Well, then, fair enough. 
[00:41:30]  Then that's the whole story.  But last I left it, I heard he was scared to come up here.  So if he did that, then that's very good.  Thank you.  So trying to save Troy Kwan.  Christ.  Save Troy Kwan.  I mean, I will say, if Troy wasn't here,  there'd be one less guy for the girls to look at.  Oh.  That could be making some lemonade, are you?  All right.  Now that you said that, okay.  You know, it really is humiliating when the stripper's in here  and he fucking wanders in.  And, like, he doesn't need to pay for them. 
[00:42:00]  It really is humiliating.  Good point.  But, yeah, we're not blindly defending a guy, man.  He's a good worker and he's a good dude.  And we all feel comfortable.  I wouldn't feel comfortable with somebody who's going to be violent in the studio.  Nobody would.  And we live in an environment, we've said it many times,  like, we could get fired today.  We never know because our type of show is so much different  than every other channel except for Howard's on SiriusXM.  It's so different. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, you can't apply.  They're never going to have problems like this on any other fucking channel.  And if they did, then it would be so obvious there's an issue.  Right.  But in our environment, it's almost like it was just a regular day.  That would have been completely forgotten.  That would literally, I never would have thought of that again.  Exactly.  After that day.  But I don't think the guys upstairs that are, like, you know, trying to get Scott's ear  are educated enough on what we do and how it's much different than any other radio show in the company. 
[00:43:00]  No, they see it the same as they would fucking some guy that's spinning on the lithium channel.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  We're the same exact thing.  Everyone.  And we're not saying, you know, we're above the law here, above the rules.  No, but our rules are a little different.  But the rules are a little different based on, you know, what you do.  Right.  Because what we did yesterday, maybe it's not okay today.  We never know.  We just never fucking know.  No.  I don't think the guy, you know, doing the 60s on 6 ever worries that he's going to lose 
[00:43:30]  his fucking job because of something he said on the air.  Do you remember that day Sam was lobbing fucking tissues at Pat Duffy or papers at Pat Duffy's  face?  And Pat Duffy.  He was ready to rip Sam's head off.  He was growling.  Yes.  And he'd go, I'll fucking kill it, whatever.  And Sam was just fucking, I was like, what a ballsy little cogsucker.  But it was.  Sam's like a little gnat in someone's face.  But he knew, like, deep down, it's like, you knew that the guy, it sounded so much worse 
[00:44:00]  than it was.  I guess because we were in the room and you can see things that people can only hear.  But it sounded like Sam was going to be fucking murdered on the radio.  And he's continually lobbing them.  But we could see, like, Pat would walk up and growl or whatever, do what he was doing.  And he was annoyed.  But even he knew in that moment, you don't go beyond a certain line.  Like, you don't, you just don't.  And watching that and being in the room with that, you understood what was happening.  Whereas if you're listening to that, you're like, there's a murder going to happen. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  And, you know, if the fight that Troy and Mark Zito had, you know, continued outside the  studio, it didn't.  No.  Then it would be tough to defend.  But as soon as you walk in that door, it's a very different world.  And Zito is fine with it.  I hear he is.  Yeah.  All right.  He's fine.  Oh, God.  All right.  We made our point, you guys.  Well, if Zito's not fine with it, I'll fucking take him.  Oh.  Did you guys really?  Maybe I shouldn't.  You walked down the hall and he just. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  After I told his assistant at nine, like, I'd like to see him at ten for a couple of minutes.  Just, you know, we only needed a couple of minutes.  And he didn't say, hey, guys, could you wait?  Or, hey, I talked to Opie.  I'm in the middle of a meeting, but we are cool.  I did talk and I'm going to fight for you.  Like, it wasn't like that where we would be reasonable.  It wasn't apologetic.  Yeah.  It wasn't like, hey, look, I'm a little crazy right now, but I have your message.  He's probably in a tough spot.  It was.  Probably feeling the pressure.  I don't know.  Pretty much.  Well, I got it.  I don't need to hear from you guys.  And then he, like, walked back into the office as he was saying something like, hey, he shouldn't 
[00:45:30]  have said that on the air.  Yeah.  It was basically beat at you, jerk offs.  Right.  Yeah.  Scram.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  It's like, you wonder why people don't want to talk to management.  That's why.  It's like, you know, it's not even that we didn't get the yes that we wanted or we got  a no.  Right.  It was just that horrendous moment.  It's like, Jesus, dude, we just want to, we're not yelling and screaming.  We're coming down reasonably to sit down for five minutes, just maybe present a point  that hasn't been made or.  Right.  Right. 
[00:46:00]  So we sit here wondering.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we got our food.  Things aren't the same since Sydney left.  Oh, I know.  It's not around the same.  The whole place is going.  Look at that's what's happening.  This whole thing is.  Yeah.  Sydney's gone and Jackie's going.  Stinks.  Oh, Jackie's last week. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Because we're taking office.  It's Sydney minus four days.  There's never been an intern whose name you remembered four days after they left.  No, it's Sydney.  I even sang She's a Rainbow all day long.  Aw.  She's a rainbow.  Yeah.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  Yeah.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  When do we get new interns?  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  Yeah.  It's going to be filthy guys.  By the way, who does the intern interviews? 
[00:47:00]  Sex man.  Okay.  Sex man.  If you hire, if three guys come in here.  Oh.  I'll bite your nose.  Yeah.  Look how nice it was.  We're getting guys.  It was so nice.  He's working on it.  We had such a...  It helped morale, didn't it?  Sure did.  I would actually...  I don't know if they couldn't hear this off the air,  but as I would walk in,  every morning I would go,  hey, da-da-da-da.  Yes.  When I walked in,  I would actually say, da-da-da-da. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Every time I came to the door.  Exactly.  All right, we're going to eat some food.  Roland's got gifts.  And if any females want to intern,  SiriusXM.com slash internships.  All right.  When we get back,  the latest on Wiener and the Pig.  The latest on her.  Mornings with Wiener and the Pig.  Jesus.  This is a morning show sounder.  Wiener and the Pig with you all morning. 
[00:48:00]  Tune in.  Wiener and the Pig.  And also the A-Rod stuff.  He was welcomed back to baseball yesterday.  It was very nice.  Yeah.  Do you believe he's been a Yankee  for fucking eight years, right?  Really?  Or nine years almost.  Since 2004.  Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman in oblivion.  Yeah.  Wasn't this a bust?  Yeah.  It was a bust, right?  I saw it on demand.  Was it good?  It wasn't bad. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, boy.  It has a lot of, like, it's like, okay, there's a little 2001 A Space Odyssey in there.  There's some Planet of the Apes in there.  There's some fucking, there's, it's like a few movies thrown in kind of a thing.  But it looked good.  It looked pretty cool.  It did well.  Kind of interesting.  It did well overseas, but here domestically, it was a bust.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  No, because so many movies like that came out at the same time.  That fucking, who was his name? 
[00:49:00]  Was it there?  Charlie Day's movie.  Uh-huh.  That.  The Will Smith movie.  Hollywood just, it's amazing how they do one thing and they can, they carbon copy it  immediately.  Yeah.  However, people don't give original sci-fi movies a chance, you know?  Like, people really want something that's been done already.  And people see Oblivion, which is an original, you know, movie.  Yeah.  It's not, like, something that's based off a TV show or a remake or something, you know?  That's why, like, Pacific Rim, it was so nice to see people, like, actually going to 
[00:49:30]  see something original instead of something that was just a carbon copy.  Was this original or no?  Yeah.  But maybe they all came out at the same time.  That was out in April.  They're all, when did the other ones come out?  Like, July.  Oh, okay.  I thought they were all together.  Oblivion.  People also.  I like that new movie.  What's that new Matt Damon movie?  Elysium.  Right, another one.  That looks really good.  But it's not, people are not saying good things.  Oh.  Oh.  But he shaved his head.  Everybody that I've talked to has said very bad things about it. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  Well, who are you talking to?  Who are you looking at?  I talk to a lot of people.  Oh.  Yeah, who do you know?  Larry Elysium?  People also know if a movie comes out in April, it's going to suck.  Yeah.  We're kind of getting conditioned that, you know.  I never understood.  They hold back the good movies.  I never understood that.  Like, if a movie's good, you can put it out whenever.  That's what I see.  I'm going to go see it.  It's a good movie.  Exactly.  You see it.  No matter when the fuck it comes out.  Well, I don't go to the movies in April.  No!  It's crazy.  I only go. 
[00:50:30]  I don't care how good it is.  I only go Memorial Day weekend.  Right.  They have figured out how to make $100 million.  They figured out how to make $50 million in the opening weekends, though.  That's crazy.  They really know what they're doing.  Yeah.  They haven't perfected it.  R.I.P.D. in its third week just cracked $30 million.  Nice.  Congrats to those guys.  That just looked terrible anyway.  Well, you knew that because Jeff Bridges came in.  Yeah, we're not stupid.  Yeah.  You get someone as big as Jeff Bridges coming in here, the movie needs fucking help.  We know.  That's why I didn't see the movie ahead of time. 
[00:51:00]  Budget for that movie.  It costs $130 million to make.  Oh, it's $100 more million.  Baby steps.  They're not going to recoup this.  That's what movie companies like.  Baby steps to the goal.  It's the Bill Murray, what about Bob approach.  Yeah.  And then the next time Jeff Bridges is in a movie that is up for Oscars, we won't see him.  Oh, you won't see him.  You don't think he'll come in for The Big Lebowski 2?  No, but we know this game.  I got my picture with Jeff Bridges.  I was excited.  Mike Myers.  Mike Myers, the only time he came in.  Oh, God, the love guru.  He came in for the love guru. 
[00:51:30]  What else?  Austin Powers, we never saw him.  We had...  Ben Stiller come in.  Ben Stiller.  Willem Dafoe.  Guy Ritchie.  Willem Dafoe came in for a bomb.  For all the lemons, they come in.  Ben Stiller.  What movie did Ben Stiller come in for?  He came in once.  He came in here.  Yeah.  After all these years, he came in once.  I think it might have been his indie movie.  I think it might have been Greenberg or something.  He did a movie called Greenberg.  We don't even know.  Exactly.  And we interviewed the guy. 
[00:52:00]  We don't even know why he was here.  Go up guru has yet to recoup.  It's budget.  It came out in 2008, though, so there's still time.  Yeah, you know what?  That was five years ago already.  Mike Myers was in.  Yeah.  That was back at K-Rock.  Yeah.  And it's a $60 million movie.  It has yet to recoup.  Was it Night at the Museum 2?  Night at the Museum 2 for Ben Stiller?  No.  And we were really nice, and we never got them back anyway.  It proves it doesn't matter if you're nice or you're awful, because they don't come back.  Hey, what did Gary Oldman come in for? 
[00:52:30]  He came in for a couple things.  Yeah, he's been in for a couple times.  Yeah.  Dark Knight.  We actually got him on a roll.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, he came in twice?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Roland's ready to give you the ssss.  Well, Gary likes us.  Well, I'm just reading off the pal talk.  Well, they end up liking us.  Someone just fucking...  Most of the times.  You're stupid, Alex fan.  Well, Gary got starstruck when he was in here.  He sure did, Jimmy.  You know how it is.  He sure did.  Oh, right.  He did.  He knew Jimmy.  Yeah, but these guys, I don't know what to do.  Ben Stiller came in for Tower Heist.  Oh! 
[00:53:00]  That is such a bad movie.  And I saw that movie.  Finally.  Oh, my God.  That was horrendous.  You can't push a car out.  We got Tarantino for Django, though.  Yes, we did.  No, we do.  Tarantino.  Yeah.  We definitely get, you know, some guys here and there for real movies.  Tarantino doesn't go to New York, though.  Every time Tarantino's in New York, he's done this show.  He just doesn't go to New York.  He seems to like our show.  Yeah.  I get that impression.  Yeah.  Jeff Bridges liked our show, but he'll never be back. 
[00:53:30]  Tarantino is fucking amazing.  Remember, what did we get Tom Cruise for that time he came in?  Well, that's right.  We had never gotten him.  Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise.  No one gets him for radio.  Would you even, I know, yeah.  Could you imagine, like, what the fuck would you even talk to him about?  I've seen him on interviews, and it's fucking.  He's a weirdo.  You're being glib, Opie.  You're being glib.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I know what I've talked to him about.  There's fucking stuff that makes it impossible.  How do they get insurance for you to run down the side of the Burge Tower? 
[00:54:00]  How does a movie company allow you to do that?  That's a good one.  How long did you have to sit up on top for those promo photos that they took with the helicopter?  And you'd say, oh, it was all CGI.  Yeah.  I just sat in the studio with the green screen around me.  Yeah, but I understand that, but it's like you actually did run down the side of the building.  There's got to be a part of you that you have faith in those guys, but isn't there a party that you get scared?  My publicist is saying I have to go.  No, but wait, Tom.  I have more questions about running down the side of the building like a magic man.  I have to go. 
[00:54:30]  I want to know.  I have questions.  I have to go.  Oh, yeah.  I would talk to him all day about that.  Oh, yeah.  What kind of food did you eat over there?  Oh.  I'm thinking of going at the end of August.  Did you guys stay in the Burge Tower, or did you stay in that?  There's a really, like a seven-star hotel that's shaped like a sailboat.  Do you like enough about the Burge Tower?  No, but I want to know.  No.  If you did.  I would have stayed in the sailboat.  That's a nice hotel, too, but I wouldn't stay there.  I would stay in the tower because I'm afraid of heights, and I think it would be fun to 
[00:55:00]  stay there, and, you know.  Oh, my God.  Now, now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  Continue. 
[00:55:30]  Baby, you've just a bomb on me.  But you're turning me on stage.  You've just a bomb on me.  Baby, you've just a bomb on me.  You were my fears.  You were my fears.  That's a good one.  You've just a bomb on me.  You're turning me on.  Oh, I get it.  Thank you. 
[00:56:00]  It's whoever you are.  U.S. dropped an atomic bomb.  Oh, Hiroshima.  68 years ago today.  Oh.  How'd that work out?  Pretty good.  It gave them really nice subways.  Yeah.  Their subway system is amazing.  Yeah, we did all the excavating for them.  Yeah.  They got some modern shit there because of us.  See?  See what happens?  Godzilla.  That's right.  It made Godzilla.  Radiation from the bombs made Godzilla.  Which is cool, because we like the Godzilla movies, right?  Of course.  Yes.  Not as much as the Shark movies. 
[00:56:30]  The Sharknado movies.  No.  No.  New Godzilla next year.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that another reboot?  It's going back to the original style.  It's not like the American version of it.  I didn't like the remake where it looked like an iguana.  It was horrible.  I like fucking Godzilla.  I didn't like Godzilla.  I used to call him a weird name.  Oh, no.  I don't know why.  I just was uncomfortable.  What did you call him?  Oh, you're dressed.  Kazuki.  It's in Godzilla.  Why? 
[00:57:00]  Kazuki.  I don't know.  You really called him Kazuki?  It was a goof.  Yeah, but it was uncomfortable.  It was a goofball.  It makes no sense.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This was pre-chipper.  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah.  This was fucking pre-stand-up.  Kazuki.  All right, what's going on with Wiener and the Pig?  You know what commercial I like?  What?  I have to...  The Elliot Spitzer commercial.  Yeah.  I think he's working it perfectly with that commercial of his. 
[00:57:30]  Why haven't...  With the music and stuff.  Admitting to his wrongs.  Really?  I like it a lot.  I haven't seen it.  And I'm not a fan of Spitzer.  I'm not a fan of any politician.  Let's say it, Sam.  Because he, of course, was also in a bit of trouble, as we all know.  He certainly was, with the hookers.  That's Spitzer and the prostitute in the mornings.  Competing with Wiener and the Pig.  You're a prostitute.  For some reason, I really like this commercial, and I like the music they used. 
[00:58:00]  He's creepy.  Oh, this video is what?  Private?  Why is it private?  It's a fucking commercial for...  Well, does Time Warner own that, too?  Anyone on that fucking Time Warner CBS thing?  What the hell is that?  Oh, that's terrible.  Well, you know what?  You listen to a CBS radio station.  Oh, boy.  It's Time Warner's fault.  Yeah.  But then I'm hearing that CBS wants too much.  Here's what I base it on.  The fact that...  Wait, wait.  For the people.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Because it really is... 
[00:58:30]  This one's a very local story.  I think it's just for New York, or is it...  New York, L.A., and Dallas.  Yeah.  Okay, those are three huge markets.  New York, L.A., and Dallas.  Officially, right now, you can't get CBS on your cable system.  CBS or Showtime.  So can't you unplug your cable and just get the rabbit ears for CBS?  Yeah.  You can, or...  Yeah, apparently.  But how does that work?  Well...  Does anyone know how to do that?  I don't know.  You have to buy one of those digital converter boxes.  Yeah, no more rabbit ears anymore.  No, there's rabbit ears.  I've seen them.  They don't work.  No, rabbit ears work. 
[00:59:00]  There's rabbits here.  No more analog signal being sent out anymore.  No, I've seen rabbit ears.  Stop it.  I don't know what's on that band anymore.  They don't work.  No, they work.  I'm fucking...  Ham radio now or some shit.  I don't even know.  I refuse to admit that technology has passed me by.  Rabbit ears work.  Stop it.  Put some tin furl on it.  Put some tin furl around the aerial.  Adjust the aerial.  I've got to watch my programs.  So just for the people that...  My stories.  So what's the deal now that we...  I would think because I've had Fios, Verizon, for a while, 
[00:59:30]  and they go through these things,  but they work it out somehow.  Right.  It seems to me Time Warner is constantly going through this,  constantly having to drop the channels.  Right.  And I think they're cheapos.  And they're a terrible service.  Yeah.  I have to sign with CBS just because Time Warner...  It's terrible.  They're pigs.  They're terrible, their service.  It's so bad.  They're slowly upgrading shit, slowly,  as our cable bills continue to go up.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Time Warner is the worst fucking service out there. 
[01:00:00]  So are they holding up CBS, or is CBS holding up them?  I think they're probably both at fault to some point,  but I think...  Thank God Travis is here.  I think Time Warner is the more at fault.  Travis is no shit.  Does he?  Travis just guesses, but sounds...  Travis comes in after we've discussed it,  and whatever opinion he gives,  we sound like he knows what he's talking about.  Yeah.  But he just knows stuff.  He pays way more attention to us.  He reads the Washington Post or something.  There's lots of papers in front of you guys,  with lots of news stories,  and lots of show prep,  and it's my job to know all of it. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah, but I got...  So when you say,  what's this about?  Can I explain why?  I want to...  Because I was more concerned about Don and Dawn.  So was I.  That's like the third story of the day.  That's one of the most important stories of the day.  We'll get into this idiot soon.  What an asshole that guy is.  Make a fucking decision.  But go ahead.  So what's your question?  Who's at fault?  Yeah.  They're both at fault.  It's two billion dollar companies arguing over millions of dollars. 
[01:01:00]  Way to take a stand.  Well, look, if it was so clear...  Come on, half a dozen of the other.  Right?  I think CBS wants like $2 per person instead of $1.  Time Warner wants all of CBS's back catalog that they give to like...  Well, they don't give, but they sell to like Netflix and Hulu or whatever.  They want it for a certain price.  CBS apparently said, you know, we'll keep giving you our programming while we're under contract. 
[01:01:30]  Time Warner apparently is the one that cut CBS and Showtime off because they know that  they can do it now before football season starts.  They'll have leverage if they do it now.  If they were to drop CBS when football season started, there would be riots.  Ooh.  Why would people be laughing, though?  It's a riot.  But...  You didn't use the chip voice.  No, I didn't.  I should have.  Well, Chip thought that one was funny.  But don't they have leverage now?  Because CBS is in a tough spot. 
[01:02:00]  They need Time Warner.  Yeah.  How else are they going to get their shit out there?  I've read that they're losing $400,000 a day.  Right.  Yeah.  Because right now they're only off in certain big markets like New York and L.A.  And L.A.  And L.A., right.  But in most of the country, where I guess they have deals with the local CBS affiliates,  they're still on the air.  And people are getting pissed off because Showtime's not on.  CBS is fucked in this.  They can't have to pay.  Well, they'll both probably concede.  Call Time Warner and tell them. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  You want CBS back.  Yeah.  And then...  And Showtime.  Yeah, they're making us do their dirty work for them.  But if you want to watch shows like Dexter...  Right.  I swear to God, I thought they were fucking with me on Sunday because I tweeted that I  can't wait to use my Time Warner cable internet to illegally download Dexter.  And about two hours later, everything in my house stopped working.  My internet was off.  My cable TV was off.  Well, if it wasn't Time Warner, I would say they were doing something.  But Time Warner constantly fucks everything. 
[01:03:00]  I have it at the apartment in the city here, and it's just horrible.  I've had to make a hotspot with my iPhone because my internet just doesn't work.  It's terrible.  And the box is constantly...  And you could plan your fucking day around rebooting a Time Warner box.  Holy fuck.  It takes forever.  It's unbelievable.  And the Fios box, you reboot it, it's done in like a minute.  They started charging a rental fee for their modems last year. 
[01:03:30]  You know those tiny little box modems that are like 30 years old?  Yeah.  They're charging you like...  They were charging like $4.  That's reasonable.  Oh, yeah?  Is it reasonable?  What's the average cable bill, you think?  $8 million a month.  Mine's about $150.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  What are you getting for that?  That's for cable and...  Shitty service.  Yeah.  And now they're taking CBS away for now.  Yeah.  They'll figure it out before football season. 
[01:04:00]  What would they do if it was football season?  Three or four weeks away, right?  What would happen?  If it was football season, they would be getting a lot more complaints.  What would people do, though?  If people complain, what would they do?  Nothing.  Would they go to Dish Network?  Or could they do that?  Yeah.  I mean, you can drop your cable service anytime.  But the problem is that a lot of these...  Time Warner's got a monopoly here.  Like, if you're not, you know, in a place where you can just get Fios, then you have  to stay with Time Warner.  Yeah.  Right.  I, uh...  Fios was pulling some shenanigans. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I saw that.  It was low-level shenanigans, but they were pulling some shenanigans.  I knew it was a matter of time.  They're all fucking assholes.  I noticed if I stepped away from my TV for ten minutes, you'd get a message up on the  screen that said, uh, hit menu on your, uh, remote to, you know, bring back your fucking  picture.  It would go into, like, sleep mode.  Why?  I don't know.  Just like an update that they sent through made...  But how does it know you're not watching?  Well, I guess if you haven't changed the channel or anything... 
[01:05:00]  Well, maybe you're watching the same channel for a while.  I know.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So, uh, I was like, what the fuck is that?  And then someone said, well, go into settings and this and that.  And, uh, apparently you have to redo your settings.  They, they updated and the default setting is like the shortest period of time before  it gets sent to sleep.  So I guess that saves the bandwidth for them, for people that just leave their TVs on all  the time like I do.  And, um, but the thing is also, if you go into settings, when you go and click how long  you want it to wait before it goes into sleep mode, you have to scroll back one. 
[01:05:30]  It's for never.  It says never.  And then two hours, four hours, eight hours or something like that.  They don't want never.  And you don't even see never up there.  They don't want never to click.  They don't want to scroll down one.  It's hidden.  So, yeah, I was able to find that.  And, um, yeah, I'm the worst fucking when it comes to bandwidth.  Uh, I, I'd leave like my, my bedroom TV is on right now.  Really?  Yeah.  I just like the idea of having people yapping in my house when I'm not there.  Aw. 
[01:06:00]  Someone might think someone's home.  Oh, well, Morgan Freeman's home.  Yeah.  Morgan Freeman's home with Tom Cruise.  Aw.  That's why there's always parties and stuff.  Anything to stop Anthony from having to be alone with Anthony.  I'm getting a kitty.  That's cute.  Are you really?  I saw that, too.  Yeah.  I figured you would, you'd break eventually.  I have to, you know.  It kind of likes cats.  Always has.  I love a good cat.  Big A will sit on it by accident.  I killed your cat.  Like Christopher and the dog. 
[01:06:30]  I was sneaking around trying to get some video.  And I, I, I crushed it slow.  You're still thinking about doing this?  Well, I'm definitely going to do it.  Wait a minute, though.  Before you go to Vegas or after?  I'm like, after.  There's, there's many levels of assholery when it comes to cats.  You gotta, you gotta make that decision.  Yeah.  What if you get an asshole cat?  There are, there are cats that are just complete and utter assholes. 
[01:07:00]  Sam still bites them.  Right.  I'm getting a bangle.  That doesn't mean anything.  That doesn't mean that they're like the nicest cats ever.  They're playful.  You gotta like be around it for a little while.  Yeah.  That's just it.  I had two cats.  One was really fucking cool.  And the other one was a complete asshole.  And I knew it from day one when my mom, I lost the cats on my parents.  I was living in that home when I first moved home from Buffalo.  And they, I lost my cat to the fucking highway in front of our house, which took out all our  pets and eventually took out my own dad. 
[01:07:30]  Oh God.  You would think we would have moved.  Jesus.  Took out everybody.  It took out three or four different dogs, two or three cats and my dad.  Right in front of my fucking house.  I grew up in.  But anyway, so I'd lose the cat because it got run over.  And my parents, they, to make everything go away, they just plop a brand new one in  its place.  Like, ah, you won't, you won't know, you won't notice the difference, but they plopped an  asshole cat on my back as I was sleeping.  Damn.  And I knew from day one, it was an asshole. 
[01:08:00]  Was it a kitten?  It was a kitten.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  You know, from day one, if a cat's going to be an asshole, you got to raise them, right?  No, no, no.  Well, look.  Cats are way more.  I'm going to go to the cattery and I'm going to pick out a cat.  Play with them for a while.  You've got a far better chance of getting an asshole cat than you do getting an asshole dog.  Wait, you're going to a place?  Yeah.  What is it called?  A cattery.  Is it really?  Yes.  They're called a cattery.  Oh, they make it a nice name knowing that they're going to kill half of them? 
[01:08:30]  Oh, no, no.  It's a cat slaughterhouse.  It's a cat slaughterhouse.  They're all...  No, you breed them.  They breed them there.  That's what they say.  Auschwitz was a Jewry.  Oh, God.  That's all cat...  That's all that is.  It's a nice name for a fucking...  It's not a slaughterhouse.  And those kittens all smell it in the air.  That's why they're all nice to you.  Yeah, but as soon as they know they're safe from the fucking holocaust, then they're going  to be assholes.  No, it's not a place that kills them.  It's a breeder.  It's going to stop being a kitten and you're not going to be in love with it anymore. 
[01:09:00]  No, I loved Jack Jack when he wasn't a kitten.  People are saying the cat you're picking out is awesome.  JD.  Yeah, Bengal cats are awesome.  They look so fucking cool.  Yeah.  And they play.  I like a good playful cat.  Something you could go, jingle, jingle, jingle with a little fucking feather.  And they go, wham, wham, batted around.  Slowly going crazy.  What?  My crazy cat guy?  Yeah.  Right.  I've always liked cats.  I think I'm going to get fucking cats.  I've always liked cat stuff.  The kitten my parents replaced my cool cat with.  Yeah.  My cool cat was flattened on 25A. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  The fucking thing.  And I was living in my parents' house for a little while in between radio jobs.  Well, I had a radio job, but making no money.  So at 30 years old, I moved back home with mom and dad for a short stint.  And this fucking kitten, they got me, would just sleep on, would go under the bed, wouldn't  come out and hiss all night.  I'm like, what the fuck are you hissing at?  That's fucked up.  That's crazy cat.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  I knew from day one that cat was an asshole.  That's crazy cat. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  And what are you going to do if it's an asshole?  I'm like, what the fuck is you, what are you hissing at?  Trying to take care of you.  I'm telling you, man.  I'm telling you right now.  It's going to be fun.  No, it's...  Just make sure you fucking pick the right kitten.  I'll look and I'll be like, huh?  I think there's a new litter in early fall is what I'm hearing at this cattery.  All right.  And then I'll go there.  Lay down.  I'll check them all out.  Just like pumpkin picking?  Yeah.  I'll play with each one. 
[01:10:30]  I'll go like, oh, meow, meow, meow.  How about this?  Close your eyes and open your eyes and whatever cat doesn't swipe at your fucking face because  it sees eyes opening, that would be the one you'd bring home.  Oh, I don't know that from experience either.  Waking up because I feel like someone's looking at me and I open my eyes and there's asshole  cat swiping at me.  You would think you would understand eyes opening and closing.  You'd think, huh?  Just get the runt.  The runt is always the best.  Yeah? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  You think the runt is?  Yeah.  Because it knows?  Yeah.  It has to try a little hard.  It's kind of like a fat girl.  It's a fat girl.  Here's what I predict.  It's a fat girl of kitty litters.  He will bring home more than one kitten.  No, definitely not.  I say that you're going to be so smitten by a couple of them.  No, no, no.  You're going to feel guilty pulling them away.  I would never.  No?  No.  Two kittens would be cute.  One goddamn cat.  He's a friend, right?  Imagine two kittens frolicking on your fucking, just two of them.  You have a massive house.  On your patio.  You need two. 
[01:11:30]  So they have company.  No, I'm the company.  Because you don't speak cat.  I'm the cat's little pal.  They make little biscuits on you.  Right.  Freaking biscuits.  Jimmy, you're missing the best part of this.  So he brings two cats home.  Fast forward five years.  Anthony's crazy cat dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hundreds of cats.  This is full of cats and shit.  Duty all over.  Pits everywhere.  We can't go in that room.  Everything's shredded.  Oh, God.  You can't go upstairs anymore because you've been saving the cat duties.  The pool's empty and just full of cats. 
[01:12:00]  It's just shit everywhere.  Cat shit everywhere.  Everywhere.  Oh, my God.  The theater.  You open up the theater.  The seats are shredded.  Cats are sleeping everywhere.  You come in here looking like you're wearing a fur coat from just all the cat hair.  Yeah.  I just fucking shedded cat hair.  You just can't get it off you.  Oh, God.  That would be terrible.  You and Patty will have something in common.  Oh, Patty.  I passed the New York.  You can take it to go get those free things.  I passed the New York Foundling Hospital yesterday. 
[01:12:30]  Did you realize?  Every time I see it, I just laugh.  I think I've dumped Patty there.  That place really exists, huh?  Dumped off.  I was at the Foundling Hospital.  Anyway.  Elliot Spitzer.  Can we play the commercial?  Oh, yeah.  So, Elliot Spitzer fucked up pretty bad with the prostitute.  And I think this is a perfect commercial for this guy as he tries to make his little comeback.  And I don't like politicians, but there's something about this.  Yeah.  I think he played it.  I haven't seen this.  Really?  No.  It's all over TV.  I haven't either.  No.  Look, I failed. 
[01:13:00]  Big time.  I hurt a lot of people.  When you dig yourself a hole, you can either lie in it the rest of your life or do something positive.  The sheriff of Wall Street is back.  Former governor of New York.  Running for New York City's comptroller's office.  That's why I'm running.  Make sure your money goes where it's supposed to go and does what it's supposed to do.  And make sure the Wall Street firms that want us to invest with them will play some music.  So if you're any negative noise out there, and you will, keep in mind where it's coming from.  Maybe being hated by the Wall Street firms isn't such a terrible thing. 
[01:13:30]  Look, when I made billion-dollar corporations pay back low-wage workers, when I pushed to give exploited, undocumented immigrants a real chance, when I was taking on Wall Street firms that were cheating millions of middle-class investors, it was all about the same thing.  But everyone, no matter who you are, deserves a fair shot.  I'm asking voters to give the same commitment.  Yeah, you know, I don't dislike Spencer at all. 
[01:14:00]  I still won't vote for him, but I love the commercial.  I don't know if I would.  I might.  Love the commercial, though.  Isn't that great?  He's probably more liberal than I care for, but there's something about him going after those guys that I really like.  And the music, it goes along with his voice.  It's not cheesy.  No.  And then you've got stupid Wiener just smiling at every parade he'd get himself into.  He's getting out of an Oscar Mayer truck like a dope.  He's fucking delusional.  It's hilarious.  I think so.  He's done.  I think he's completely delusional.  I really do.  No chance in hell of winning.  No chance of winning. 
[01:14:30]  And now the pig made a sex tape, but she's trying to say it's not a sex tape.  Why isn't it a sex tape?  Technically, she's not having sex with anyone.  No, no.  I want to see what her vag looks like.  I don't think that's happening.  Is it plump and fat and juicy and meaty?  So, look, they put American flags all around her.  You think she's milking it?  Oh, God, is she milking it?  I love her.  What a delight.  Delight?  She's sexy.  She's a dope.  Let me see how sexy she is. 
[01:15:00]  Flash.  Does it make up time now?  Okay, good.  Okay, go ahead.  Pause.  All right, I like the voice.  Yeah?  Yeah, she doesn't look that bad right now.  That fucking swimsuit photo shoot was horrendous.  Terrible.  What'd she do?  She hit the gym for a few weeks?  Eating butter?  Yeah, going to the gym.  Eating butter.  Eating butter.  I'm Sydney Leathers.  I grew up in southern Illinois, but right now I live in southern Indiana.  Wow.  Anthony Weiner and I had a sexting relationship for several months, and that came out in the 
[01:15:30]  press, so here I am.  She's hateable.  So, here I am.  Exploring it.  Let me see her sound a little bit more.  Look at her juicy legs, man.  I like that.  She looks way better in this than the swimsuit.  Yeah.  Photoshoot.  Ah, I like that.  Get the fuck paws.  Nice.  No way.  She won me over.  That is a juicy rump, and it won me over. 
[01:16:00]  That's a guy's ass.  No, that is a whole tiny.  Look at her bottom.  I'm tiny.  Look at it.  It goes way up where the hip.  That's not a hip.  No, no.  You know what it is?  Her fucking, because it's a terrible angle for her legs.  Her legs should be straight, and you'd see how juicy and melon-like those ass cheeks  are.  They're huge.  That's a bit.  Yeah.  Oh, deep crack.  Oh, she'd smother you with that and teach you a lesson.  I'm plumping up.  I fucking think.  I don't need to be taught a lesson.  I don't want the ass to look like normal. 
[01:16:30]  No, dude.  Her ass, that's a bad angle for her, though.  That's a bad angle.  I'm telling you, that's a nicer, fatter, juicier ass than you think.  What is the fucking folds over there?  Is that the bottom of her ass?  That's where her ass ends.  That looks like it's halfway down her leg.  And her leg starts.  That's a big ass, man.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know how bad that smells?  Oh, it probably smells wonderful.  You can keep that clean.  After a bus ride, after a bus ride through Vancouver where a beheading has happened, she's all nervous.  No. 
[01:17:00]  I don't know what the fuck.  Let's keep going.  What is this, the preview clip?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  Good.  Initially, Anthony Wiener had poked me on Facebook, and that's how our conversation started from there.  I am attracted to intelligence, so that's what turned me on about him the most.  Why?  Shut up.  I was shocked and flattered at the same time when I saw that he poked me, and then as the conversations progressed, it quickly turned sexually. 
[01:17:30]  Look at her cankles.  And it's just me to see my cankles.  Hold on.  I don't like this.  Dude.  Oh, Jesus.  You guys are nuts.  Dude, that is a fuckable woman.  I'm telling you.  Look at how juicy and big those legs are.  Those legs are huge.  You hold those ass cheeks, and she smothers you with them.  She hugs you with her legs.  From the, I would say the belly button up, she actually isn't bad, and her boobies look pretty good right there and firm.  But then it looks like legs from another fucking woman. 
[01:18:00]  I would hit that in a second, dude.  Fuck.  Look at those big, juicy legs.  I like that.  Those are nuts.  You wouldn't bang that girl?  No, I would.  Oh, yeah.  I'm with you.  Oh.  Fuck, man.  Look at that little fucking boy shorts.  You know, you did.  Kind of like the booty, don't you?  The face is good.  The boobs are good.  I like a nice big ass, man.  The voice is kind of...  Look in the mirror.  I have a big ass.  I have a big ass. 
[01:18:30]  All right, continue.  That was third grade.  Yes.  I just remember him complimenting me a lot, and then I could tell where it was going from there.  Oh.  Boobs.  Her tits are great.  Don't get new tits.  They're all right.  Look at that.  Look at those legs up in the air.  Oh, I want to see your vag, please.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He's big.  That's great.  I want to see your vag, please.  Dude, look at that.  You fucking hold those big chubby legs up like that. 
[01:19:00]  Oh.  You're only going to get bigger, too, man.  She's a young girl.  Don't marry her.  But I'm saying, do you know how good that would feel?  Like, it would probably, when you put it in, go like...  It would make this sound like you have fucking rubber shoes and mud.  Really?  Yeah, it would sound like you just lost your fucking galoshes in a storm.  Old galoshes pussy.  Hey, galoshes box, get over here.  Fred from Brooklyn.  She has Andre the Giant ass.  Oh, she's sexy. 
[01:19:30]  Fred Brooklyn on Twitter.  Very good.  Damn.  I think she's sexy.  Yeah?  You don't like that?  Yep.  He would always compliment me on, you know, my breasts, my ass.  He would tell me stuff about my feet and how good I looked.  Oh, he liked her feet, too.  What a dirty boy this wiener is.  The ass looks better in that shot.  The ass looks better in that shot.  He would tell me.  Yeah, that's a little fucking... 
[01:20:00]  She's got bigger legs.  Like, the ass is not big enough to fill out the legs.  Yeah, look.  Look at her ass is in the middle of this mass of leg and hip and stuff.  That's still nice to drown in, man.  There's something going on there.  I would die in there.  The thighs go, like, way out past the ass on the sides.  Dude, you know what you do?  You look at just the ass, that's pretty good, but...  You've got to cut it off way over there, then it would look way better.  If you're on top of her...  You've got to lose three inches on the right side, and then it would look in proportion.  You reach under and hold those buttcheeks, and those big, soft thighs wrap around you 
[01:20:30]  and just hold you.  Oh, you would just hump, quick hump, like dog humps.  You'd just give her fucking dog leg humps.  I love how Jane puts this.  He's actually doing...  Yeah, I think he's touching himself.  And he's doing the dog hump.  But do you know how good that would feel to just be in there, like those big legs holding  you in there, and oh, my shoe would just milk cum out of you.  You'd be finished.  It's probably all sloppy.  Keep your hands above the table.  They are.  Okay.  They weren't. 
[01:21:00]  I know they weren't.  I was primping.  Who are you?  Dude, he's really into this.  She is.  Yeah, I like her.  There's that ass.  It's not that bad.  It looks better than the beach pictures.  The beach, for sure.  Yeah, they were terrible.  It was horrendous.  They were terrible.  For sure.  Stuff about my feet, and how good I looked in heels, and how I was the perfect height to  wear heels, and stuff like that, so.  Boobs are a little droopy.  They kind of talked about maybe helping me get a condo in Chicago, and then that became 
[01:21:30]  this whole other fantasy of, you know, well, how will I sneak in and out without people  recognizing me, and, you know, how will we have sex and have the neighbors not here,  that type of thing.  The fact that he was hitting on me was extremely flattering.  We did send each other pictures.  They were pretty much all nude.  He would ask me very strange things, like, you know, what are you wearing today? 
[01:22:00]  You know, may I see, you know, what kind of shoes do you have on?  She would have a funeral.  I was underneath that dress.  Jimmy knocked that one out of the park.  Where would you?  Fastball right down the middle.  Yeah, I don't know what he's done that's wrong so far.  She's saying he would ask weird things, like, what am I wearing?  That's a normal, sexy question.  See, they know, like, most of this video they're showing from, you know, just pretty much her face.  Because they know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Her face isn't bad at all.  And the boobs aren't bad at all.  They know we want to see that fucking hooch. 
[01:22:30]  I want to see it.  I bet it's fucking...  I hope it's not like a...  Sometimes, like, there's really weird pussies that go, like, concave, and they're just like...  I hate them.  I have nothing to them.  ...type of thing.  So, there were photos in and out of clothes, but most were out.  He had a very big fetish for high heels. 
[01:23:00]  I don't know if that's something he's about for all girls or if it was just something for me,  but he loved pictures of me in high heels.  I am into sex.  I'm pretty open about it, honestly, especially for someone from the Bible Belt.  They don't...  They're not really used to that there, so...  Something about her voice makes me want to punch her in the face.  A little different from the normal Midwestern girl.  Girl.  So smart, girl.  Girl.  Girl.  Girl.  Bull.  She sounds like you're hearing her underwater.  Yes.  I thought this would be way worse. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  If we're being honest here.  She's in love with her.  I'm going to date her.  Are you?  Yes, we're going to go out.  Get some dinner.  Do you guys follow each other on Twitter?  Yeah, why not?  Why wouldn't you?  Do you white-night her?  No.  I told her she was a delight.  Oh.  And I meant it.  And she followed you?  Well, she was following me before.  Before the scandal?  I don't know how long.  I'm not sure.  Why?  I don't know.  That's odd.  That is odd.  It's not.  I'm pretty...  Pretty famous.  I like a lot of jokes.  You're famous, right?  Who knows if she even runs her own Twitter account.  She might have just linked at me through somewhere else. 
[01:24:00]  What do we have here?  Who is this funny man?  I keep going with you.  Wow.  She's big.  She's not perfect, but I like that man.  We had phone sex several times a week while this was going on.  Oh, boy, Anthony.  So we spoke frequently.  Yeah.  Nope.  I was on a train to Chicago, which he knew at the time. 
[01:24:30]  But he insisted that he needed to tell me about the sex dream he had about me right at that  second.  Oh, boy.  So he called me, even though he knew I was on the train.  He told me about the dream, and then it just kind of progressed from there.  Where?  Oh, look at her.  It actually was exciting, and he asked to see what I was wearing that day, so I showed  him, and then he wanted to know what was under it.  So I actually took a picture of my panties on the train.  I'm all in with Anthony Wiener. 
[01:25:00]  This guy is a professional.  All she's done is make me like Wiener more.  Honestly.  That's all normal shit.  Hey, what are you wearing?  Let me see what you're wearing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice shoes.  It's not crazy, wild.  You're seeing this guy's naked underbelly, and that's what he likes.  He's not some crazy guy who wants her to be 10 years old.  Yeah.  Look at all these pieces of garbage you guys elect.  He's just a guy who wants to see this chick.  Like, I don't believe his wife's probably all uptight.  Hillary needs me to go take the cake for a fucking hour. 
[01:25:30]  Hillary needs me.  Hillary needs me.  Fucking boo.  Hillary needs me.  And this one's got the high heels on.  The other one's like, I'm wearing comfortable shoes.  Hillary and I are going to be walking all over Capitol Hill.  And this one's fucking all flirty.  Oh, I'm going to Chicago.  Tee hee.  I'm going to train.  My cunt is sweaty.  Tee hee.  Tee hee.  Tee hee.  Honey, honey, could you put on some high heels?  No, I certainly won't.  I'm wearing smart ankle socks.  Hillary needs me to run some mellows. 
[01:26:00]  She's on the train fucking.  So you can see why this guy would stray.  To women, that's what you got to do.  By the way, all the women that could wonder why your guys stray, it's because you turn into fucking boars.  Take a picture of your twat on the train.  Be fun.  Sure, there you go.  You're like a marriage counselor.  Take a picture of your twat on the train.  Jimmy's going to get women arrested all over America.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, Jimmy told me.  There's going to be a spike in train fares.  We're just taking the train. 
[01:26:30]  But you know what I mean?  That's why guys like younger women, because they're not jaded and fucking boring.  So how about you do that?  Holy fuck, is that funny.  To do some dirty shit.  Talk about your fucking tootsies and what you're wearing on your feet.  I've got to cut my hair and put on some comfy shoes.  I've got to run around.  Oh, black.  Comfy shoes.  Exactly.  We're in Keds.  This one's got fucking...  So Wiener's still married because it helps his political career, obviously, right?  Who knows?  He probably loves his wife. 
[01:27:00]  He's not really into the marriage thing.  He's the mother of his kids, so he's like, what's he going to do?  What's he going to do?  You know?  The only problem I have, I think you're right about a lot of the things you're saying,  is the fact that he had the second chance.  So it's like, push that shit down if you really give a fuck about being mayor.  Yeah.  Because they're watching you closely.  The perv switch.  Right.  That's the only fucking problem I have with the whole thing.  Yeah.  They accepted it.  They were all in.  He was leading in the polls and everything. 
[01:27:30]  It was working for them.  Somebody said on Twitter, how come no one jumped on when I said, all she does is make me like  Wiener more?  Ah, shit.  I guess we're all so tired of the Wiener puns.  Yeah, Wiener jokes.  Man, we just take it for granted at this point.  So I don't like Wiener more.  Never, never, never.  Wiener in the pig.  All right, let's get to the end of this.  Why would you buy the video if they're pretty much showing you everything you need here?  I think this is just like an interview.  I think the video, she's going to be doing some sex, right?  She's masturbating in the video.  Oh. 
[01:28:00]  How about that?  What do we got here?  Oh.  We're going to have to have Chip do the play-by-play of that.  Oh, yeah.  I love when Chip does play-by-play of pornos.  Talks about a cooter.  That's because I know how to get everybody fucking turned on.  No, you don't.  It's like dope.  Pekka.  You want to like...  Cuda.  Want to do some play-by-play with the remaining minute of this video?  She ain't showing nothing.  All right, let's see what happens.  She's fucking smiling right now.  Her head is tilted in a devil-may-care fashion.  Oh, devil-may-care. 
[01:28:30]  For him to see.  She just tossed her hair, but now she's in front of a bunch of flags, and she's holding  a paper over her cunt, and she has a half a tie on.  I hope she's not going to hang herself.  She's wearing a man shirt that's wide open.  Sometimes the buttons would fall off of my shirt.  I've had sugar daddies in the past, and that's recently come out in the press a little bit,  but I haven't talked about it before.  Oh, yeah.  She's wearing a nice bathing suit.  It's a lovely, it's a lovely deep blue, like the ocean.  That's a big fucking girl.  They blew it right there. 
[01:29:00]  It looks like the flag blue.  She's wearing, she's in front of the flag, and she's wearing a very deep blue with very  red lipstick and white skin.  She looks like a giant flag or something.  I want to come all over her stripes.  She, uh, Sam, you still in for real right here?  Absolutely.  That's, that's, that's a big belly.  I like that she's chubby, though.  I don't mind it either, dude.  I don't like fat chicks at all, like even as friends, but this one is fucking sexy.  She's not a fat chick.  I've been enjoying looking at chubby chicks recently, though.  Oh, really?  You see, that's not, to me, that's like, that's not even that chubby. 
[01:29:30]  That's like a little bit thick.  That's thick.  That's not chubby, really.  She's a big girl.  Yeah, she, how tall is she?  At the bottom.  5'1".  How tall is she?  I don't know.  She's not that tall.  I like her.  If she was six foot, I'd fucking marry her.  Six foot.  She's a giant.  Yeah.  Big, big, nice, long feet make me smell them.  Tall, chubby girl.  No, I don't want a chubby girl.  Honestly, no.  Well, she's chubby.  She's not, though.  She's not.  She's a little chub.  I like it, though. 
[01:30:00]  She has a little meat on her, but she's nowhere near fat.  Chubby is different than her, I think.  She's chubby.  She's got giant tattoos.  Iroch is chubby.  Oh.  You know, I have a chubby boy.  I have a size girl who could never pull off these giant tattoos that she has on.  I don't know.  And he's a chubby boy.  Chubby boy.  You're a chubby boy.  Can we get those?  Iroch, would you put those brown panties on?  You might need a bigger cup.  Iroch, the boss wants to know something. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I'm not answering that.  He just doesn't play anymore.  Yeah, I think she's sexy, man.  All right.  We're just about done with this video.  It's on, what, where is it?  Gawker, I guess?  Yeah, it's all over the place.  All right.  I'm sure people are finding it.  I don't know if the video video is out yet.  Stop saying video twice.  All right.  I was finished.  My first sugar daddy was someone who kind of just helped me pay the bills.  Oh, I love her.  I was several years younger.  Sugar daddy.  And he helped me with rent, helped pay for my car, just normal things like that. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah, normal things.  They kind of spoil me.  The funniest part about that situation was that I kind of made him think that something  would happen eventually, and nothing actually did.  And that went on for three years.  Cock cheese.  Yeah.  It was like the most exciting part of my life at the time.  Wow.  It sounds thrilling.  Yeah.  She's got no stories, by the way.  Of course.  She's trying to make everything sound. 
[01:31:30]  But even the sugar daddy story is like, nothing ever happened.  And we took over.  She sounds like a female Uncle Paul.  And we took a layover, and I was waiting in Detroit Airport, and I noticed that there  was a hot dog stand, and I said, I normally don't eat them, but I said, today, va, va,  vo.  Exactly.  What?  She's got nothing.  You don't think she has sexy stories?  No.  One time I was stiff-legging a shit, and Anthony Reader texted me. 
[01:32:00]  Stiff-legging.  Yeah, one day I took a shit that was so hard that both of my shoes shot across and scratched  the door.  My high heels that he loves so much put scuff marks on the door.  Oh, shit.  How come nobody's mad at her for putting her feet and vagina all over the American flag?  I know, right?  You're right.  That's very disrespectful.  They fucked with Lil Wayne.  Yes.  That's true.  I guess, yeah, you're right.  She's laying on the flag like that.  Good point, Sam. 
[01:32:30]  Yes.  Yeah, I like that point.  Racism.  Yeah.  Well, that's just totally racist.  Look at her legs open like that, inviting you.  Inviting.  Come on in.  Yeah, I'm going to decline the invite.  You wouldn't?  No, she's just a fucking...  Sydney Leathers.  Leathers.  Can't be a real name, is it?  Yeah, it is.  It's crazy.  She...  I mean, for most of that video, she wasn't that bad.  When she was standing up with the blue bra and panties, or was that a swim... 
[01:33:00]  I don't even know what the fuck it was.  What that was.  That wasn't flattering at all.  Crazy.  She'd get it.  Well.  Right.  Good for Sydney Leathers.  I think she's delightful.  And for all of us.  And what is...  And when Wiener was smiling like a lunatic at what parade was that one, over the weekend?  Oh, he was at a parade?  I didn't see that one.  Oh, the parade, yeah.  But he loves smiling and making it look like people are cheering him on. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  Him and A-Rod.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Holy fuck.  Well, thank everyone for all the support.  You're not getting any.  You hear what A-Rod said after the booing?  I guess we'll play the booing after the break.  I love Chicago.  I love the fans up here.  They're great.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, they showed how great they were.  I didn't hear anything.  Booing your ass.  There's no part of A-Rod that sounds like, ooh.  He is hated.  They're not booing him.  They're saying A-Rod.  He's hated.  He's hated everywhere. 
[01:34:00]  Wade Boggs became loved here.  Chuck Knobloch.  A lot of guys from rival teams and rival players come here.  Even Clemens won people over, even though they kind of always had like a, you're a dick thing.  Once he got into George's box.  George.  Oh, what a wonderful moment.  Hey.  What did he say?  See me real soon.  See me real soon.  Real soon.  It's great to be back.  There you are.  I'm a bitch.  What did he go?  Four and 17?  What was his record that year, Jimmy?  It wasn't good. 
[01:34:30]  It was terrible.  Could we please hear that?  The one form?  Yeah.  I just want to hear that whole thing where she's, her bad voice, him saying.  And you gotta be, uh, you gotta play Chip, uh, doing play-by-play for porn.  I know we got that production piece.  We'll play that at the break.  But first, we gotta do the Susan Wallman thing again.  Yeah.  Again.  I love that.  She's so fucking...  We'll be seeing y'all real soon.  We'll be seeing y'all real soon.  Gonna go four and 20.  Hey, ya have it. 
[01:35:00]  I'm gonna go four and 20.  That was terrible.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  I fucked up, Sam.  Sorry.  Started.  Started.  What is the pig for?  That's, I think, representing Susan.  Oh.  Nice.  Roger Clemens is in George's box, and Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things... 
[01:35:30]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen,  Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box,  announcing he is back.  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee, and there we go.  We need the other clip where Roger's like...  Gonna be seeing y'all real soon.  And then our new favorite part of that clip is where she's like shushing somebody  because it's her moment.  It's her big moment.  Someone's fucking in the background.  Someone's probably like, 
[01:36:00]  Susan, we gotta go to a...  There's a toilet cleaning product commercial I gotta get to.  Quiet!  I wanna hear about Posada, the Yankee dugout.  Yeah, Andy Pettit is the worst party.  The guy in the fucking Shining Hotel was at a better party  than that was happening in the Yankee dugout.  He's trying to make a moment.  Yeah, Posada's smiling.  Great party, isn't it?  Oh, God damn it. 
[01:36:30]  We should have had some sugar daddy jokes.  With her being fat, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, goodness!  Yeah, someone wrote,  well, this girl needs a Nutri-Sweet Daddy.  Oh, really?  There you go.  That's a good one.  That's the joke.  Goodness gracious!  Travis?  Erica, does that have a long clip?  I said I did, but they didn't tell me to play it.  What are you yelling at me?  Who did you say that?  Who did you say that?  I said it on the air.  What?  I didn't hear him say it.  I said it on the air.  I had a pig mask.  I didn't hear you. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, and Posada's got an axe.  He knew.  Oh, shit.  Roger Clemens is standing behind the column with an axe.  I kind of picked an axe.  She's taking a moment.  Oh, he's got it?  Yeah, he's standing there, I guess.  Yeah, he's standing there, I guess.  Thank you all. 
[01:37:30]  Well, they came and got me out of Texas.  And I can tell you, it's a privilege to be back.  I'll be talking to you all soon.  Roger Clemens is in George's box,  and Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious, of all the dramatic things, of all the dramatic things I've ever seen,  Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box, announcing he is back. 
[01:38:00]  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation.  Spot.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  Big size.  Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  Attention fans, he is here.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation.  In the rotation. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, there's a bunch of bats and some balls and gloves.  There seems to be a telephone on the wall.  It's the worst celebration ever.  I've never heard of the worst part.  Cups and Gatorade.  That could also be what happened in a wake.  Right.  Because they all knew he was going to go 4-25.  Right, right.  All she says is, you should see what's going on in the dugout.  And then she describes the moment.  Do we have the video?  Yeah.  Can we get that video?  And do we have a longer clip?  What happened right after that?  Because that's where our clip always ends.  Right.  Did John Sterling pop back on?  Yeah, he said, shut up. 
[01:39:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  And why did New York accept a lady with a horrible Massachusetts-Boston accent to, you  know, do play-by-play for Yankees games?  Blocks.  And George is blocks.  When she jumps in right after Roger Clemens.  Oh, God.  Roger Clemens.  We're going to be talking to you real soon.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It just comes screaming in.  I'll be talking to you all soon. 
[01:39:30]  Roger Clemens.  Oh, my God.  It charges me.  Oh, my God.  Roger Clemens.  It's on a chalkboard.  It's like a wig monster came in.  A Muppet-faced wig monster just broke into the room.  Holy fuck.  She's the only one not affected by the chair legs on a fucking tile floor.  That is so fucking funny.  Oh, my God.  The amount of excitement for something so not exciting.  What was his record for real? 
[01:40:00]  Like, it was under 500.  That year?  Yeah, he didn't do well.  I can check.  Yeah.  Turned out to be a bust for the Yankees organization.  Is there any other Susan Wallman clips that people play out there?  That's by far the best.  It's the best one ever.  I know.  What's the second best one ever?  Susan Wallman.  She is fucking.  That is the greatest fucking clip. 
[01:40:30]  Her excitement at nothing.  Yeah.  Just that description.  Just the fact that she's like, let me explain to you what's going on in the dugout.  And then she just says, one person is smiling.  Yeah.  And another person knew.  So, I guess he doesn't have to be smiling.  He knew already.  He doesn't have to smile.  You got it, Sam?  Oh, God.  That's so fucking great.  He had a record of a six and six. 
[01:41:00]  Fucking one more and he'd have a pretty fucking cool record.  4.18 ERA.  He had six times.  Six and six.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or 2007.  He was six and six with a 418 ERA.  I think he would have brought someone up to do six and six, right?  He actually won six more games than I would have.  It's not very impressive of Roger Clemens in that operation.  And you could have fucking, you know, pitched in front of everybody at Yankee Stadium. 
[01:41:30]  How cool would that be?  Yeah.  It would have been a lot of fun.  It would have been that much worse.  They would have had six less wins.  I would have had to answer to the press after the first game.  You walked 17 people in the first inning.  Ah, it's just the jitters.  I'm getting over it.  You hit two batters.  There was a line drive home run.  And you gave up 22 runs with 17 walks and got only one out.  And that was because the line drive that was going over the fence hit the foul pole and was caught.  Like, yeah, it was the first game jitters. 
[01:42:00]  My parents were watching.  How much fun would that be?  Jim Norton's in George's box.  You wouldn't have ruined the team that much more than where it was.  And they could have taken all that money.  They saved and paid for a good pitcher.  And that would have been entertaining as all hell.  Yeah.  Look, what's going on in the Yankee Duggy?  There's a questionable woman in a dress.  Jim, no.  I would love to find that clip and see what happens after.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  Let's get the date.  It's out there somewhere.  We'll find it.  To find full audio.  Hey, now you go to fucking fullaudio.com.  Oh, okay.  We're going to talk about Don and Dawn next.  And we got A-Rod being booed and being oblivious to the whole fucking situation.  Boo.  You guys press conference too, right?  Yeah, Sam's got it.  She does.  But first this.  All she's done is make me like Wiener Moore.  Welcome to another Viscous Entertainment production of Porno for the Blind. 
[01:43:00]  Narrated by sex god Lyle Jibberson.  This is Farrah.  Backdoor Teen Mom.  She's sucking as Pekka.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now she's still sucking as Pekka.  Now she's back.  She stopped and now she's sucking as Pekka again.  She's holding as Pekka. 
[01:43:30]  Now she's looking at his Pekka.  Now she's back up.  He's got his Pekka.  He's got his Pekka in her.  He's playing with a clit with a Pekka inside of her.  He's got his hand on her leg and his other hand on her clit and he's putting his big Pekka inside of her.  She's moaning because she's moaning because she's moaning because she loves his Pekka.  She's got her head on her head on her pillow while he slams her cooter with his Pekka.  That's a cool picture right there.  You can see her butthole and his Pekka slamming in and out real fast. 
[01:44:00]  Now it's out, now it's in, now it's out, now it's in.  Now it's out, now it's in.  He's holding her butt cheeks while he puts his Pekka into her really hard and fast.  Now he's moving her hair because it's on her shoulder and he's holding her hips and he's putting his Pekka in her pussy really hard.  He's giving it to her good.  That's the way I fuck.  Why the fuck did we use that guy's voice?  Thanks for listening and be on the lookout for more Porno for the Blind releases from Viscous Entertainment. 
[01:44:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show continues.  Continues, continues.  In moments, in moments, in moments.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more. 
[01:45:00]  Rockin'.  We are rockin'.  Rockin'.  Rockin'.  I woke up this morning to...  Rockin' with Dockin'.  Rockin'.  On the home of rockin' roll.  Rockin' roll.  I woke up this morning.  I guess I fell asleep with MTV on.  What is that about?  I don't know.  Something must have been on that I was watching. 
[01:45:30]  But then, of course, there's some videos being played this morning.  It was a Justin Bieber video where he looks like he's doing a handheld...  Beauty and the Beat.  Beauty and the Beat.  Beauty and the Beat.  Featured Nicki Minaj.  It's so bad.  It's so incredibly bad.  He's in this ankle-deep water at one point and he's dancing.  See, it's so embarrassing.  This video is big because it came out in October. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  And, like, a week before the video came out, they were reporting, oh, Justin Bieber's laptop  got stolen.  Oh, and there's an anonymous source threatening to put out video that they found on his laptop.  Ew.  So they make him...  Oh, Christ.  And then the video...  They're trying to make it look like the whole thing's like a selfie, like a fucking Vine  video or fucking...  Like he's just partying with Nicki.  Like he's just partying and it's...  But it's so produced and...  Let's see.  So they're trying to make this look like it was stolen? 
[01:46:30]  I mean, once you...  That was the gimmick to get it started.  Now it's...  You could tell it's bullshit because it's stolen from musician Justin Bieber.  And we all know...  Exactly.  That can't be true.  And he got in trouble in the Hamptons.  He gets in trouble every day.  A little fight.  He's another fight.  He's a little troublemaker.  With who?  I don't know.  Some chick.  Oh.  I don't know.  Stop hanging out with Lil Twist.  I love all these fucking rappers that are hanging with him.  They're doing these videos. 
[01:47:00]  You guys are really hardcore street guys, huh?  Yeah.  A lot of street cred.  Oof.  Yeah.  So I woke up and I'm just...  And then I think I...  Out loud, I was like, how long is this?  It's a fun song to wake up to.  Let me see it, Sammy.  It just went on and on and on.  Is he cool in it, though?  Yeah.  Is he trying to be cool, though?  He's trying.  I'll make a prediction.  Yeah.  Lil Jimmy's gonna be tapping his toe.  Oh, boy.  I might be.  Oh, no.  Is it catchy?  I think so.  It is a little catchy.  I like Boyfriend more than I thought. 
[01:47:30]  He starts dancing.  He's like...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, he's grabbing his dick.  Yeah, he's his.  That's side-to-side dancing shit.  That's side-to-side dancing shit.  It's happening to you.  But your feet are staying in one place, but you fucking move side-to-side.  It's terrible.  Nicki Minaj comes in for a...  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  I'm a count.  Nicki Minaj.  I'm a Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  That's count here.  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  She's in there making funny faces.  Legally up-doted by an anonymous blogger, but they can't get it down.  Yeah.  Oh, they're trying to make it look like...  Look.  No game.  See, so people thought, oh, it's his personal footage.  Let me talk to Nicki.  Let me talk to Nicki.  Why did they show that?  Would you rather...  I'm hungry.  They're like, oh, he's crazy on the road.  He pulls pranks. 
[01:48:30]  I like the sound of the video camera.  This is just him partying.  Right?  Yeah.  But why is it only beautiful people?  Left by his life.  Oh.  By the way, he's holding on to a fucking camera on a dolly.  Like, like, there's no way he's keeping himself in frame like that.  This is all horse shit. 
[01:49:00]  While you crack the mystery.  The synchronized swimmers in the fucking little lazy river.  He's at a water park, apparently.  Just partying.  It's his house, dog.  Oh, is it his?  Is that his house, is it?  I don't know.  I'm kind of like gullible.  There's chicks all over the place.  Is it?  Yeah.  Are we supposed to believe at this point this was stolen?  No.  Now you know it's the video.  Oh, they got you. 
[01:49:30]  I wasn't sure where the crossover was.  I'll say it's an original concept for a video.  And it's not terrible, the song.  It's just a kid.  No, I don't like it.  I don't hate it or like it.  Don't make me go on a Troy Kwan rant.  Oh, look at him.  Look at his dad dancing.  You don't think he's good?  Why is he ruining his shoes?  He's fucking standing in the water.  He's going to get his fucking ankles all wet.  Hope he doesn't get yelled at for tracking that through the house like I would have. 
[01:50:00]  Chipper, get out of the water.  He's bad at singing and dancing.  How come he's singing under the water?  I couldn't do that.  I got water up my nose.  My mother yelled at me.  Chipper, you're going to drown in there.  Maury's wigs don't come off.  And Hurricane Fort's wind.  He's just popped out of the water.  Yeah.  Oh.  Is this a big hit?  It was very big.  When is Nicky coming to ruin the whole thing with that? 
[01:50:30]  I think right now.  Nicky killed it.  Right here?  What is that?  There's cameras underwater.  That's crazy.  Yeah, this is a big one for him.  That guy has destroyed your equipment.  You put it under water, it's going to get electric ruined.  They're all on a slip and slide dancing.  Oh, boy.  How come he's not wet and over all wet?  He's backing up, but everybody's got water on him.  I don't know.  What the fuck? 
[01:51:00]  Crazy.  It's just magic.  Oh.  Is she going to make crazy faces?  Oh.  It's mine.  Ten little letters and a big sign.  Just seen Bieber.  You know I'm going to hit him with the ether.  Bummed out.  Wiener.  But I got to keep an eye out for Selena.  Beauty and the beast.  Beauty and the beast.  Beauty and the beast.  It's Selena.  It's Selena.  It's Selena.  Isn't that weird?  They added the R to that one.  He's sexy with her.  She's sexy.  No, I'm guessing he's sexy with her. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, you think so?  Oh, yeah.  It's hot chemistry.  All right.  See, they were feeling each other.  It goes on and on.  It was like somebody throwing Wonder Bread on vodka, watching those two together.  Yeah.  That's all right.  That was great to wake up to.  That's all right.  Whatever.  Fuck.  It was a huge hit.  Yeah.  I was very worried about the Kardashians.  Why?  Oh.  I was watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and they're in Greece.  Oh.  Ask sex. 
[01:52:00]  And the young daughter's just not having a good time, and, you know, no one in the family's  talking to her, and her fucking vacation's being ruined, and she thought that she would  get some fucking alone time with one of the Jenner boys.  Brody Jenner.  Oh, boy.  You watched, too.  I was very concerned.  Yeah, she felt left out, because they went on a 4x4s without her.  She's in the most beautiful place in the world.  Santorini.  Santorini.  Santorini.  Santorini.  And she's not having a good time.  I was feeling it, yo.  Yeah.  I had to watch the Kardashians.  I felt really bad for her, man. 
[01:52:30]  She doesn't have a privileged life after all.  Oh, huh?  She has problems just like you and I, Sam Roberts.  That's terrible.  I had to watch that.  It was on after Total Divas.  What the fuck is wrong with that family?  Well, one, Kylie, what's wrong with her is nobody pays attention to her.  She's the hot one, though.  Yeah, she is.  It's like fucking Bruce and that, what's her name?  Kris Jenner.  Yeah.  Kris whatever, Kardashian slash Jenner.  They had the two daughters together. 
[01:53:00]  Right.  And the one is fucking beautiful, and the other one's homely.  Although I've completely turned around on Khloe.  Khloe had a big ass in that fucking episode.  I'm all about Khloe.  She had a trucker's ass.  That ass is no.  Yeah, I agree with Sam.  No.  Khloe's more than Kim or the other one.  Kim looked horrendous pregnant.  Kim was not exactly glowing.  When you're pregnant, you're supposed to have a glow about Kim.  She looked horrendous. 
[01:53:30]  Pregnancy did not agree with her.  Everything was blown up on her.  Like she had too much salt.  Everything was puffy on her.  She looked horrendous.  And she laid around like a beach whale.  She gained way too much weight.  You're not supposed to gain that much weight when you're pregnant.  Yeah, really.  It really didn't agree with her at all.  But if you have a life where no one tells you no ever, and now you're pregnant, guess what?  You're not going to be able to control yourself. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  You don't watch this show?  No, I don't.  I've never seen an episode of it.  I've seen, you know, a while ago.  But now, I didn't even know it was still on, to be honest with you.  Yeah, no, every season they do their vacation show.  Yeah.  And this year it's in like the most beautiful place in the world, Santorini.  Well, they're Greece.  They're Greek, aren't they?  And Mykonos.  Mykonos and Santorini.  Are they Greek?  Albanian.  Albanian, right.  Albanian. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  Oh, from Albania.  Armenian, maybe.  Armenian?  Romanian?  Which means they get five o'clock everything.  Everything.  Hairy fucking.  Everything is growing at all times.  Flintstone mouth pussy.  Yeah.  It's just growing everywhere.  If it's quiet, you could hear it.  Right.  And it's growing hairs out of their fucking mouth.  Everywhere.  Their assholes, their ears, their eyebrows, their nostrils. 
[01:55:00]  In the late 80s, I went on a date.  It was a hot waitress.  She was Romanian named Alice.  Yeah.  We went out and she actually went out with me.  And we kissed and I could feel a little bit.  You could feel the stubble?  Yeah.  Yuck.  You've turned around with the Chloe, huh?  Yeah, she was up here and she was looking real good.  She wasn't looking good and he sent that in the episode.  She was looking better than Kim was.  Yeah, Kim looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  How much longer does Kanye have to stick around with that shit?  Kanye's in love.  No, he's not. 
[01:55:30]  No, he's not.  That thing is over within a year.  Well, Don is back.  Thank God.  Don was Don and then he became Don and now Don is Don again.  They always do that.  What do you mean?  They always do that.  It's so ridiculous.  Oh, the Don, Don, Don thing.  Yeah.  They always have the names.  Whenever a guy turns into a girl, he's got to make his name kind of like the guy's name.  Bob.  Now Barbara.  What would your girl name be? 
[01:56:00]  I'd have to be Antoinette.  I'd have to be Antoinette.  I think there's one for Greg.  Mine is Jamie.  Jamie.  Oh, Jamie.  Jamie Norton.  Jim Norton, who is now Jamie Norton.  And we just have to accept it because he's so damn funny.  Yeah, and I have to come in with my wigs, but no one can acknowledge it because I won't  be mocked.  I won't be mocked for this.  That would be one.  And then Greg Hughes, who's now Greta Hughes.  Greta!  That's the only one that works, though. 
[01:56:30]  I don't know.  Fuck.  Why can't I have a cool, sexy fucking girl name?  Yeah, like Victor and, of course, Victoria.  You could do that.  Yeah.  Opeta.  Opeta.  Opeta is my favorite.  Opeta.  Opal.  Opal?  Opie, who's now Opal.  Or Gregaria.  The Opal and Anthony show.  Opal and Antoinette, the first shop jocks to have sex changes.  Oh, would we be some ugly fucking chicks? 
[01:57:00]  You're ugly men.  I know.  That'd be terrible.  We should do it for a year.  Oh, yeah.  We should just come in here every day in women's clothing.  Make the company and everyone accept us.  Yeah, exactly.  You get some ink.  Get some ink.  Definitely get some ink.  What's ink?  Press.  Fuck.  It's not even ink anymore.  No.  Get some digital pixels.  Hits.  Pixels.  Pixels.  Yeah.  You know how sad it's gotten?  I was in that Geneseo scene from my old college. 
[01:57:30]  I was beyond excited.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  We used to be in real magazines.  I forgot.  There aren't even magazines anymore.  True.  For the most part.  Although our Vice article's online.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, I saw that.  The Vice interview was nice.  She did a pretty good job, right?  Yeah, definitely.  I think it's on vice.com right now.  I tweeted yesterday, I guess.  I'm a guy again.  The ABC newsman who switched genders wants to switch back is the headline.  He thought he was a woman trapped in a man's body, but it turns out he's just another boring straight guy. 
[01:58:00]  Oh.  What?  Well, you'd better know when you make this decision that you're making the right move.  ABC news editor Don Ennis strolled into the newsroom in May wearing a little black dress.  A little black dress.  Yeah, girls like that.  Usually that's pretty hot.  Right?  But not when it's on Dawn.  Not Dawn.  Oh, God, no.  In an Auburn wig and announced he was transgender and splitting from his wife.  He wanted to be called Dawn.  Dawn, Dawn, Dawn.  Man, I know in this new fucking era we live in we're supposed to be way more accepting than when we were growing up. 
[01:58:30]  But are we allowed to say this one fucking is a little weird?  It's very weird.  I don't know, though, man.  Adam Carolla got in trouble.  Fitting?  Yeah.  For the same thing?  This shit's a little weird.  I'm sorry.  It is a little weird.  Come on.  It's weird.  All of a sudden you're at work and the guy you knew was a guy comes in as Dawn and insists that you call him Dawn.  That's weird to me still.  I'm sorry.  It's very weird.  I'm sorry.  Are you allowed to say that or are you going to get in trouble? 
[01:59:00]  I think you're all right.  But now he says he's...  Well, I won't have that type of talk.  Oh, God, sorry.  But now he says he's suffered from a two-day bout of amnesia that has made him realize he wants to live his life again as Dawn.  What?  What is he, a soap opera plot?  This is crazy.  Amnesia.  I accused my wife of playing some kind of cruel joke, dressing me up in a wig and bra and making fake IDs with the name Dawn on it.  Seriously.  Ennis wrote in an email to friends and colleagues Friday explaining his shock after he woke up from what he called the transient global amnesia last month. 
[01:59:30]  We've got to buy stock in that company.  Sounds funny.  Transient global amnesia.  It's going up.  Get some puts.  Some puts.  Some calls.  Some calls.  It became obvious this was not the case once I took off the bra.  Keep reading, Opie.  And discovered two reasons I was wearing one, he said, referring to his hormone-induced breasts.  Oh, it was his...  What did he...  All of a sudden... 
[02:00:00]  I don't understand what's going on.  I'm being led to believe.  He only wore the wig for two days, but he was taking the hormones to turn into a woman before then?  He had amnesia.  For two days.  For only two days?  Or it took two days for him to wake up from this.  How do you forget you're a guy?  Right?  I've forgotten a lot of shit, but I've never forgotten...  Like, all you hear is look down at your cock and balls and then brings your memory back.  Oh, yeah.  This story's more confusing than Don.  Oh.  See what I did there?  Don is an asshole.  Don is. 
[02:00:30]  Don's an asshole.  How long did he have the transient global amnesia for?  I don't know.  Oh, fudge.  Two days.  What?  All right.  Let's keep reading.  Yeah.  It became obvious this was not the case once I took off the bra and discovered two reasons.  I was wearing one, he said, referring to his hormone-induced breasts.  I thought it was 1999.  And I was sure...  Was he partying?  Yeah.  I should have waited there.  I knew that was coming.  I apologize.  You can't say 1999 and keep going.  Purple Rain, which 1999 is not on, was voted the second greatest album of all time by Entertainment Weekly. 
[02:01:00]  Behind Thriller?  Nope.  Entertainment Weekly.  Behind...  Sgt. Pepper's?  Sgt. Pepper.  It is a Beatles album.  Abbey Road?  No.  The White...  Meet the...  Rubble.  I believe the answer is, if I was paying close attention, I believe it's Revolver by the Beatles. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, Revolver.  What's on Revolver?  Some really good songs, man.  I would hope so.  Great fucking songs.  I thought it was 1999 and I was sure as hell that I was a man.  And it said in the email titled, not reportable, very confirmed.  I don't know what this means.  Fortunately, my memories of the last 14 years have been since returned.  What?  All right.  This is fucking horse shit.  It's nonsense.  It's utter nonsense. 
[02:02:00]  I'm really confused.  Because it says he had a two-day bout of amnesia, but his memory came back of the last 14 years?  It's utter dreck.  During that two days, his memory came back?  I don't know.  No, it says from a two-day bout of amnesia that has made him realize he wants to live his life again as Don.  Sounds too bad.  Yeah.  You get one switch.  I don't believe amnesia makes you fucking forget you're a guy.  Shut up, Don.  Go fuck yourself. 
[02:02:30]  I love how angry we get shit.  It's the horse shit.  We all just take turns getting angry.  We're getting angry.  That's silly shit.  Yes.  But I don't understand what's going on.  I don't either.  That's a wacky story.  So he was aware that he was a girl, but then he had amnesia for two days, and then when  he came out of the amnesia for two days, he realized, holy fuck, I'm really a dude?  I like peckers.  Fortunately, my memories of the last 14 years have since returned, but what did not return 
[02:03:00]  was my identity as Don Ennis, who has been wearing lipstick, skirts, and heels.  Oh, what a delight.  I'm writing to let you know I'm changing my name to Don Ennis.  That will be my name again, now and forever.  Thank God.  And it appears I'm not transgender after all.  Ah.  I've retained the much different mindset I had in 1999.  So he went from 1999 to 2013 as a chick.  Yeah, 14 year bout of amnesia, and then his wife fucking smashed a mallet into his head, 
[02:03:30]  and he went, oh yeah, I'm a guy.  Right, I get it now.  What a dick.  What a dick.  He's a dick, this fucking guy.  Pick up your mind.  Let's see.  I have retained the much different mindset I had in 1999, and I am now totally, completely,  unabashedly male in my mind, despite my physical attributes.  So he still has to get rid of his tits.  He still got his tits.  He gets bored.  Get a hobby, shithead.  He gets bored.  He does.  He gets bored.  He looked at his dick and balls, which are probably uneventful, and went, meh. 
[02:04:00]  Who needs them?  And now he's looking at his tits and going, meh.  Yeah.  I'm asking all of you.  This was all in an email to all his colleagues, so he involves everybody.  Why wouldn't he?  Mr. Attention.  Me, me, asshole.  What does this have to do with fucking making sure the file's in order?  Exactly.  Holy fuck.  How about this?  If you have a wig on, we'll call you Donna.  If you're wearing a fucking Yankee shirt, we'll call you Don.  Surprise us.  Right.  How about just, hey, asshole.  Yeah.  How do we remove the gender? 
[02:04:30]  Your answer to that?  That should cover it all.  The asshole, yeah.  Oh, God.  I'm asking all of you who accepted me as a transgender to now understand I was misdiagnosed.  Is that what you call himself?  Misdiagnosed?  Yeah, but misdiagnosed, right?  Go ahead.  Take it.  I did.  I'm already using the men's room and dressing accordingly.  He noted.  Is he letting his coworkers feel his tits?  Because he's a guy now.  It's like kind of funny.  Yeah, now you gotta, right.  If it was the girl, then you'd be an HR. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But if it's the guy, you're just like, hey, Don, could I grab a handful of tit?  Let me see how those tits feel.  And then he'd be like, sure, go ahead.  I'm using the men's room, dressing accordingly.  It's so odd to be experienced this from the other side.  As recently as last Friday, I felt I was indeed a woman in my mind, body, and soul.  Until last Friday.  Right.  I hate this fucking guy.  Ha, ha, Jimmy.  That annoys me. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Let's see.  Do you think he likes having special treatment?  He loves it.  Loves it.  Oh, does he love it.  So tell us more.  Well, my journey.  Shut up.  Do you hate when someone has a journey?  Here's what this guy's problem is.  He's an attention whore.  My journey of self-awareness.  Yeah, you know, it's funny for a long time, and I felt like I was living inappropriately  as a man.  And then I was a woman, but I guess I got some comment.  Oh, tell us more about your story. 
[02:06:00]  Well, you know, it's funny.  I was very confused.  I had an amnesia.  Oh, oh, oh.  Chatter in the lunchroom was about you again.  Shut up.  Just fucking.  I don't care what you are, but don't make us all adjust.  Why do we have to read your stupid email?  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, and our whole lives now have to revolve around him at work.  Who wants to see that at home?  We're involved.  I don't want to be involved.  Meanwhile, you send out a picture of your cock and write LOL, and you're fired.  Yeah.  But he can send out this drollery, and you have to fucking take it seriously. 
[02:06:30]  You have to, or else you're fucking.  Don again.  Yeah.  Crime or something.  Um, all right.  Okay.  Even though I will not wear the wig or the makeup or the skirt again, this is in an email  to everybody.  We don't care what you wear.  I promise to remain a strong, straight ally.  A supporter of diversity and an advocate for equal rights and other LGBT issues.  Oh, fucking nerds.  Including same-sex marriage.  Good for him.  Good for him.  The fuck does this have to do with your job? 
[02:07:00]  You know what?  Nothing.  Why do we have to be involved?  Ennis has previously told friends that he suspected his sex mix-up happened because his mother  gave him female hormones as a child that made him look and sound young to prolong a bit  part acting career.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  He was a child actor that was growing up, so mommy gave him hormones to keep him, you  know, a little soft.  Oh, right.  To get a few more paychecks.  But he ended up developing breasts and started thinking he was a woman. 
[02:07:30]  Thanks, mom.  God, all the things you could do to your kid.  Holy fuck, man.  Why would you give him hormones?  Just so they could be on a fucking Burger King commercial.  A Crest commercial?  Right, right.  Yeah.  He finally came out of it one day when he kicked his mother in the cunt and realized  that was all he needed.  Selfish bitch with no stage career.  Fucking stage mother nightmare.  Giving him drugs to keep his fucking voice like that.  You want me to keep reading it?  God, yes.  He explained he had gone to the National Institute of Health in Bethesda for testing last 
[02:08:00]  month to understand why his mind and body changed from male to female.  He said he learned it was a hormone imbalance that could be fixed.  A week after he was discharged, his wife rushed him back to the hospital because he thought  he was having a seizure and was experiencing a drastic loss of memory.  How much attention does this guy need?  Every second.  Take me to the hospital.  Take me here.  I've got to rescue me.  Rescue me. 
[02:08:30]  Rescue me.  Fucking Don, just deal with it.  God almighty, what a drain.  You know what your wife wants to do?  She wants to straighten out the fucking curtains.  Not deal with your stupid, confused, attention whoring ass.  She just got used to living with a fucking woman.  But it's going to explain the amnesia.  Now we're getting into the two-day amnesia thing.  Oh, good.  I'm sorry.  So he went down for testing to, you know, figure out why he thinks like a woman, I guess. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  And then he had this weird shit that addressed a loss of memory.  So he was rushed back to the hospital.  Don added that he now feels fantastic as a man again.  Oh, that's good to know.  Because everyone got used to it and wasn't talking about it.  And he was like, uh-oh, what can I do to get attention again?  Oh, I'll go back to a fucking guy.  Get a center of attention.  Anthony makes a great point.  Sure.  There was a guy named Michael...  Hunt?  Michael.  Hebranko?  The fat dude.  Oh, Hebranko. 
[02:09:30]  Hebranko.  Sorry.  Why would you?  No.  The story of Michael Hebranko.  Sorry.  Yes.  He was one of these fatties they had to cut out of his own house.  Then I think Richard Simmons got involved in this one, I think.  Ah, yeah.  Lost all the weight, became a fucking star.  Like, he was everywhere.  Yeah.  And then guess what?  People didn't give a fuck a year later.  So what'd he do?  So what'd he do?  He missed the attention. 
[02:10:00]  He went and got fat again.  Yeah.  And he admitted the reason he went back to being a huge mess was because he missed the fucking spotlight.  I miss my fans, the adulation.  So I think you might be onto something here.  He's a douche, Michael Hebranko.  And he said he hopes that with the hormone treatment and surgery, things will only get better.  He plans to change the gender and name on his driver's license, work ID, and email.  There you go.  More, more.  More attention. 
[02:10:30]  More about you and your journey.  Attention from the people at DMV.  More attention from everyone.  Oh, Don?  Don?  What is this?  Well, let me tell you.  You think he put the New York Post on everyone's desk this morning?  Oh, yeah.  Who made the paper again?  My story?  He's proud of himself.  If you want to continue keeping tabs on my story, read this.  But then he downplays it.  Like, oh, yeah, yeah, I saw that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't even know why they're reporting on it, to tell you the truth. 
[02:11:00]  It's just my life.  Make-believe fucking downplaying bullshit.  Oh, this guy's the worst.  He's just an attention whore.  That's terrible.  He called his three-month odyssey into the world of woman.  Wait, three months or three?  I don't know, Jimmy.  It's confusing because...  When did this happen?  It said 99.  He started getting tin implants.  Oh, are you doing that to be silly at parties?  What are you doing?  Hormones.  Exactly.  He wasn't a child at 99, was he?  I hope not.  He's the fucking ugliest fucking teenager I've ever seen in my life. 
[02:11:30]  I think he went bald at 12.  Yeah.  That is really a bald head.  He's awful.  Got the little horseshoe hair.  He's with that waiter at that fucking place we go to.  Oh, I missed that guy.  Looks like Grady.  Yeah.  You're...  I actually stole my wig and tried to burn it down.  My tits had to be corrected.  Your son is attempting to bring a transgender into this situation. 
[02:12:00]  Transgender?  We're almost done with this entire story.  If someone else has a better timeline, help us out.  Right.  He was getting hormones in 1999, but his mom gave hormones to prolong a career as a child actor.  That fucked his mind up, I think.  But then he was a woman for how long, and then he had the amnesia for two days, and then decided he has to be a man again.  But now they're saying that he called his three-month odyssey into the world of woman a tremendous gift.  So right there, they're saying he was only a woman for three months. 
[02:12:30]  I don't understand.  Odyssey.  I know my wonderful colleagues...  This was in the email, Jimmy.  You're going to love this.  I know my wonderful colleagues will no doubt make it easier for the next person to transition at ABC, he wrote.  The startling he-to-she-back-to-he move came after Ennis had publicly announced on Facebook in May that he was leaving his wife of 17 years, Wendy, to become a full-time woman.  Wait, Wendy?  All right, so in May, he decided to become a full-time woman. 
[02:13:00]  So what, he was just confused from 1999 until May of last year, or May of this year?  Hmm.  I guess, and then three months officially as a woman.  But before that, he was sort of a woman because he had the hormones that gave him tits.  Mm-hmm.  The Connecticut resident has now assured friends and colleagues that his switch back to being a man isn't a joke.  The new change I'm revealing to you today did not arise because I couldn't hack it, or people wouldn't accept the new real female me, or I had trouble finding shoes that fit. 
[02:13:30]  A little humor.  A little levity.  I like that.  He hasn't lost his sense of humor.  But then in those parentheses, he writes, oh, I found plenty, more than I could afford.  Ah, my God.  He's just like any other girl.  But he's a guy now.  What's his shoes?  What are you?  Aw.  Sneakers, shoes.  Make up your fucking mind.  Get a hold of yourself for Pete's sake.  Right.  Right. 
[02:14:00]  The editor had said female was the gender that ruled my body and now my mind.  Females, the gender that gave me.  But Anna said in last week's email to colleagues that he was reversing course again, declaring, no, I'm not fucking with you.  No, this is not a joke.  No, this is not an episode of would you fall for that?  No, it's an episode of, it's not all about you, douche.  Yeah.  Enough already with yourself and your journey. 
[02:14:30]  How many of his colleagues have added him to the spam fucking folder?  Enough of you and your emails.  How annoying is this fella?  Ugh.  Yeah.  Well, Godspeed.  Whatever.  Enjoy your newly fucking realized penis and have yourself a field day.  I don't care what he does.  Or how about, hey, it's his journey, you know?  It is his personal journey.  Or how about you just keep it to yourself and not include everybody?  It's hard to keep it to yourself when you've got tits.  Yeah, but all right, then you come back in with your stupid bald head. 
[02:15:00]  And then if someone asks, you go, yeah, I decided, fuck it.  Exactly, and that's it.  I'm a dude now.  Not a big statement in fucking interviews and bringing everybody into it.  Oh, God.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Send to all?  Send to all.  You ever send an email to all?  No.  I don't think I've ever done that.  If you ever see me do that, you know I killed myself.  I definitely pick and choose out of who sends, like, when you get a huge email, I'm like, 
[02:15:30]  well, he doesn't need to know.  Yeah.  On a need-to-know basis.  I've never gotten one of those.  Exactly.  Wait a minute.  Mm-hmm.  I like it.  Oh, wait, we got a guy.  Yeah.  Hey, fellas, what's up?  Hello.  Oh, wait.  Yeah.  I'm learning.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to go to you in a second, Doug.  I'm learning that this guy, Don, Don, Back to Don, was the understudy for Skippy on Family Ties.  No way.  Is that true? 
[02:16:00]  All right, whatever.  Go ahead, Doug.  Boston.  Yeah, so I'm a director in Boston, and the WB affiliate, and the first time I walk in  for my first night, I'm introduced to my producer, my weekend producer, 6'4", ugliest woman you've  ever seen in your life.  And I find out that it was Gary, or it's Carrie, who used to be Gary.  You hear this?  Gary had...  6'4", 6'4", ugly woman.  Oh, God. 
[02:16:30]  Ha, ha.  Who's now Gary?  And she...  I still laugh at this shit, and I have to say it.  I don't understand this one.  I'm sorry.  The problem was, she was taking all these hormones, and of course, the news business is pretty  high, you know, intensity, and she would fucking lose her mind and stuff so wrong.  Kick shit around, scream and yell.  Oh, my God.  It was unbelievable.  Did she grow nails on her giant hands?  Oh, God.  She had man hands. 
[02:17:00]  Man body, the whole thing.  Man body.  She had man body.  And they always...  Long hair and...  Don't you just love lobster?  And they all look ugly.  Yeah.  They all look ugly.  They don't know how to shop like a woman or anything.  Yeah.  Well, and actually, I have somebody in my town there, one of the kids, a poor kid,  his dad went from Bob to Ariadne, okay?  That's not even close.  Right.  And Ariadne is another one of those hideous looking... 
[02:17:30]  Whatever.  You know, there are people that are transgender or whatever, and they struggle.  I get that part of it.  I'm sure it's confusing, but this guy just annoys me because he's like an attention whore.  Yeah, right.  All right, sir.  Oh, he hung up on his own there.  All right.  Bobby in Kentucky.  Bobby.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  So, I feel like I can explain the dots first here.  He became a woman three months ago, and then this recent episode of Amnesia took him back  to 99, and when the memory started flooding back, he's like, I got this. 
[02:18:00]  I'm a woman.  This isn't right.  So, it was the Amnesia recently that made him realize he's not a woman.  Right.  Oh.  Ugh.  Right.  How draining.  Yes.  He's fucking draining.  God almighty.  Because then he's going to have amnesia again, and then he's going to go back to the game  That was stupid.  I realized I was a woman. 
[02:18:30]  How do you remember to go to work?  Yeah.  How do you remember to piss in the toilet?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  There's your explanation from Bobby, though.  Thanks, Bobby.  That's great stuff right there.  Oh, this guy's full of fudge.  Can we listen to A-Rod getting booed last night?  Fuck yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, what happens now?  He was suspended for 211 games, is it?  Yeah.  He can play while he appeals.  He's got until tomorrow, I think, to appeal this ruling.  It's questionable whether he's going to appeal or not, because if he appeals, I think they're 
[02:19:00]  really going to come down on him hard.  And they could kick him out of baseball for good.  Yeah, but he might be thinking, I'll be fucking 40.  What good will I be if I honor this?  Right.  Right.  Wait a minute.  There's a lot of things that could happen.  So, Bud has another card to play, if he has to?  Yeah, I think so.  I think if he tries to appeal this, they're really going to fucking come down on him.  If he appeals, it loses.  Yes, yes, yes.  But how long does the appeal process take?  I don't know, but he's allowed to play during that appeal process. 
[02:19:30]  How long?  If then they say, well, now we're banned from baseball.  I don't know.  Maybe he can stretch the appeal process out for two years.  Well, that's what I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  That'd be interesting.  It's like in fucking Casino.  All right, now he's the beverage guy.  Now he's the entertainment director.  They just keep shuffling him around.  Eric Stengel.  You're the bat boy.  You just play.  Eric Stengel, of course, from the Stengel brothers there.  We know Justin a little bit more than Eric, but Eric's a cool dude as well.  Sure.  Works for Letterman.  He was killing it on fucking Twitter with this A-Rod thing yesterday. 
[02:20:00]  His tweet that made the paper.  Oh, that made the paper?  Yeah, I read that one.  No, there was one that was even better.  This one's funny, too.  He tweeted,  A-Rod, I hope you've learned your lesson now.  Have a good game tonight.  I didn't read that one.  I read the other one, though.  The other one was really funny, too.  I can't remember that one.  Andy Levy had one, too.  Yeah, Andy Levy, I think, made the paper.  Did he?  He made the paper, too, but not where the fuck was his.  Whatever. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, he had a good one, too.  Yeah, his is good.  It's like...  I don't know where it is.  It might be in the other paper.  I had a fucking hilarious one.  It was the good news for the Yankees  is that this suspension includes postseason games.  Yeah.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Very good.  You see mine?  What was yours, Chippa?  I said, keep taking steroids.  What, do you want to hit the ball?  Timbuktilla or something?  Holy fuck.  That's just terrible.  What happened?  He just interrupted.  It's not even fucking the least bit funny.  And by the way, he turned into Edgar first 
[02:21:00]  and then didn't say anything  and then turned into Chip.  Oh, you're Tom Chippa.  He's got a terrible problem.  My tweets are all in the paper today.  Amplified!  Jesus, I forgot.  I just hurt my neck doing that.  He's pulling muscles.  Ow!  Edgar really is, like, difficult to watch him do.  There's a lot of muscle involved.  Yeah, it's a lot of muscles.  I hurt my neck doing it.  Should maintain, like,  seven different Twitter accounts for all of them. 
[02:21:30]  I've thought of that.  I really have.  So I don't like doing the Vine videos or whatever  as Jim Norton  because there are people who don't know me from O&A  and that's not, you know,  I would love to do Chip Chipperson as...  They think you're just, like, wearing cowboy hats?  They probably just think,  this guy's not funny.  What's he doing?  Yeah.  What are these characters?  But even other characters,  they're probably like,  this is what he thinks is...  Or I meet a girl  and she just fucking follows me on Twitter  and then sees this,  you know,  when you're something.  And she's like,  this guy's a comic?  He's fucking awful.  Then she gets amnesia  and fucking pulls a dick out.  Exactly. 
[02:22:00]  I mean, mean.  Yeah, and I forgot that, you know,  someone had a PayPal account.  Home run theft.  What?  Oh, yeah.  What?  Do we have the A-Rod booing?  I definitely want to hear that.  How about this?  The boss wants A-Rod booing.  Play it.  Oh, was it this one?  I was looking for the Eric Stengel.  Was it,  not sure when A-Rod suspension will be announced?  This was before it happened, obviously.  But if they could do it in a way  where he's let off the field in cuffs,  that'd be great. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  It was killing it yesterday, man.  Eric Stengel on Twitter.  I'm going to tweet a hilarious one.  He doesn't, by the way,  he doesn't risk being banned for life  if he appeals.  He's appealing, yeah,  he's appealing what he got,  which is 211 games.  Yeah, but why aren't the other guys  appealing?  Because it's in their best interest.  Why, though?  Because.  Why they're not appealing?  Yeah.  Probably because they get  their stuff pre-peeled.  Worse than he has.  But what could be the problem 
[02:23:00]  if they appeal?  Because there's a mountain of evidence.  The reason that A-Rod is appealing  the reason that they're going  to try to win the appeal  is that they feel  that he's being unfairly targeted  because he's a first-time offender.  He should be getting 50 games  instead of 211.  Fender bumper.  But they're saying that he...  What did you say?  Fucking fenders and bumpers.  Oh, a fender.  A fender.  A bumper.  Fuck yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Tail light, you're my god.  That's a good tail light joke.  Fuck yeah.  I'm feeling far between.  Oh, shit.  But when they work, they work.  Oh, my fucking nothing  gets a bigger laugh.  Nothing gets a bigger laugh.  Oh, God.  Fucking jackers.  I know.  It's never enough.  Didn't even have a big pecker.  Nothing worse than that.  You tug at a little Asian one.  My buddy would be like,  get that out of here.  Whole toothpick. 
[02:24:00]  What?  What are you saying?  Go ahead.  No, I'm done.  No, no.  I want to know.  So basically, he has to appeal  because it's his career.  Yeah.  Yes.  As he said, he's fighting for his life.  But could they ban him from baseball  for appealing?  No.  No, you lose the appeal.  You serve the 211 games.  Oh, I thought they could fucking...  So basically, the appeal process  is going to take a really long time.  Why wouldn't you?  He'll probably be done  by the end of the year.  But he'll probably play the season.  Oh, I just got a text from Pete.  He said,  appeal will happen in November or December. 
[02:24:30]  So he will play out the season.  Yeah.  And then he'll just end up being...  If the appeal stands  or if he has 211 games to serve,  then he'll do next year  and then some into 2015.  Because 211 games is the rest of this season  as of Thursday,  plus all of next year.  Right.  But he's probably thinking  that he could at least go through this season,  have a postseason or whatever.  Whatever.  I don't know who.  What did I just say?  So he's not going to be  the all-time leader in home runs now.  No.  But it was a guarantee for a while.  Unless he gets 50 games. 
[02:25:00]  He could survive a 50-game suspension.  Yeah, but he won't.  I don't know why the Yankees  just don't get rid of this piece of shit.  Could you imagine  it's the greatest fucking season  and postseason he ever has now?  And it's like,  uh-oh, we're going to lose this guy.  What do you mean?  There's two runners on and nobody outs.  And then he flies out to the outfield  instead of hitting to a double play.  Exactly.  A-Rod is back.  Only one out.  Only one RBI missed.  Fucking hunk of shit.  The double plays he hits into  in those clutch fucking situations.  And any of you people that go,  you're only $200,000! 
[02:25:30]  He didn't put the Yankees!  He's worth it.  He's getting a quarter billion,  you fucking assholes!  He should have!  Should have gave you more than one.  Yes!  That's his job.  Fucking Brian Doyle  fucking carried the Yankees  through one foot.  I never remember watching him play.  Who?  Brian Doyle Murray.  Bill Murray's brother.  Brother from Caddyshack.  Oh!  He's been in everything.  No, Brian Doyle in 1978  was the fucking  the unknown guy  who carried the Yankees 
[02:26:00]  through everything.  I believe just in the world.  He had a phenomenal World Series.  You didn't know him before.  You didn't know him after.  Where's he?  That's what I'm saying.  A-Rod did what Brian Doyle did.  How many other fucking  weird like heroes  have been in these World Series  for one series?  Look at Brian Doyle, Sam.  While we make love.  I think Posada was smiling  or something.  Yeah.  Is Posada smiling?  Brian Doyle's back!  Hey, Brian Doyle Murray.  There he is.  There he is.  Wonderful actor.  He was a great player. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, from Groundhog Day, too.  Isn't that the Brian Doyle?  That's right.  He pulled out the fucking...  He pulled out the rat.  He was.  He pulled out the rat.  Is that it, Travis?  What else?  It's basically...  Why is he so hateable?  Because he makes  so much fucking money?  He does it to himself.  He's a hateable person.  Ah, he wants to play...  Sorry, Travis.  He wants to play this season  because the contract money  is bigger this year  than in 2015.  Who's that?  The way his deal is structured  is he makes less  as the years go by.  Yeah, he's helped Pete  to stop listening to us.  Hold on.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  He actually heard you. 
[02:27:00]  All right, stop listening to us.  But that's...  It's weird that you're listening to us.  He stands the game financially.  But that's how...  That's who A-Rod is.  This cunt.  He just cares about himself.  Clint Howard.  That's right.  Fucking man, right?  I'm with you.  Clint!  Is that right?  The greatest lesser brother  of all time...  That's Clint Howard.  The greatest lesser brother  of all time  is Clint fucking Howard.  Clint Howard.  Over Brian Doyle Murray  any day.  That's right.  Serial killer on Seinfeld.  That's right.  Although Tom Hanks' brother...  There's a tip  a chambermaid, I think.  Oh, what's that? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, tipa.  Chipa.  Chipa.  Pop up Tom Hanks' brother.  This goes with our retarded...  Tom Hanks' brother.  It's the slightly off  retarded version of Tom Hanks.  But he got some lines  in Toy Story.  Yeah, he was in a...  No, Jim Hanks  was in a movie  called Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Tom Hanks.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, there you go.  Bit of a drop-off  between the brothers. 
[02:28:00]  What's his brother do,  I wonder?  They gave him lines  in Toy Story.  Now, look at the head of hair  Tom Hanks has  and this guy  is totally bald.  Well, maybe, you know,  Tom Hanks  could afford the follicles.  You think?  Tom Hanks got some follicles?  Maybe.  Let me see that hairline.  Oh, yeah.  You can see the hairline.  Let's see.  Pull that pic out  and let's see the fucking hairline.  Fuck yeah.  I mean, let's do it.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, fucking yeah.  Follicles.  Oh, yeah.  You can see follicles.  Blow that up.  Blow that up.  I think you're right.  Dude, I see him already. 
[02:28:30]  Yep.  He got the follicles.  You can even see  the slight scar.  Individual follicles  placed artistically  in the direction  the hair grows.  Let's see.  Yeah, yeah.  Get up close.  Nostril hair.  Wow.  I think it's mustaches.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's see.  All right.  We're going up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's follicles.  Yeah.  He had some follicle transplants.  Looks like they hammered them  in one at a time.  Because the side is like  it's a little fucking strange.  Yeah.  You get a little recede.  Look at that.  Look at that.  And then the front is 
[02:29:00]  hey, good for him.  Hair plugs.  They're not hair plugs.  Oh.  They're individual follicles.  Follicles.  Ones, twos, and threes  placed artistically  in the direction  the hair grows  for a natural look.  Like a wig?  Yeah.  No!  It's like a high-tech wig.  No, it's not a wig at all.  It's your own growing hair  that you can style,  swim, color,  whatever you did  with your other natural hair.  Just do everything  but comb it  or it rips out your scalp. 
[02:29:30]  You have to put a hat on,  obviously.  Because if you pull  a comb back once  your fucking scalp  comes out  from the cheekbones up.  Did he play A-Rod  playing last night  even though he's suspended?  Very confusing.  It must be nice  you could be suspended  but you still  go to work.  That's like Troy  coming to work today.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly, with a pair of tits.  Like fucking  Oh, that was done, Troy.  Or like George  coming to work  after he quit.  Right.  Yeah.  What, you thought  that was serious?  What are you doing here? 
[02:30:00]  That's why  I am here  and you're  over there.  The way he shoves  and fucking puts his hands  That's why I'm over here  and you're  over there.  A couple things  going on.  Someone is trying  to claim  that Chris Farley's  brother is the greatest  lesser brother  of all time.  What?  No.  Stop it.  You're not going to be  Clint Howard ever.  He was in the film  together.  Let's say hi to Mike  Francesa  who knows a little bit  about the A-Rod situation.  Mike?  Boys, you're looking 
[02:30:30]  for a little insight  that you've called  me at home.  Not a problem.  I'm always glad  to come on.  It's been a while.  It's been a while, Mikey.  How are you?  I think what bothers me  to boast about A-Rod  is I'm sitting there  like the rest of the nation  watching this press conference  and we don't know  exactly what goes on.  I wasn't there.  You weren't there.  We only have the  evidence to give it to us.  But when Alex is up  there in front of the world  God and contrary  and he says  I feel fortunate  to put this uniform on again.  I feel like I'm 18 years old  when I first faced 
[02:31:00]  the red side.  Alex, you're up there  because you're coming  off an injury  and this is your grandstand.  Okay?  I mean, you have to  You're a big major champion.  Okay?  And you took the word  out of my mouth.  Alex could say yesterday.  I think Twerk 1  should be here today.  That's my opinion.  But I'm not an expert  on Twerk 1.  Okay?  Twerk 1, but I don't  have any problem  with these gay remarks.  Okay?  I can work for your station.  He's offended  in the fact  I can work for your station.  Okay?  Now, I'm actually  going to have problems  at home.  Okay?  Because I'll rage 
[02:31:30]  your mic comes out  and then I change  my tone of voice  and then my wife  has told me  I don't know  what this big deal  of a lot is  and I say  I'm not just in the table  with my small children.  I said  The guy did steroids!  What's the matter with you?  You don't know  what he did wrong!  Oh, it's the angry mic now.  That's right, he is.  The guy did steroids!  That's some  wonderful insight, Mike.  All right, guys,  that's all I have.  I don't want to burn out here,  okay?  All right, so I'll talk  to you guys soon.  All right, there you go. 
[02:32:00]  Mike Pratt says, everyone.  Very good, Mikey.  Stop with the Chris Farley  brother thing.  He's not going to win.  No, no.  He's not going to win  over Clint Howard.  Clint Howard's the best.  What about Swayze?  Swayze's brother?  Brother Swayze  doesn't really do much.  Greatest lesser brother  of all time.  That was a good one.  Why didn't they just take...  Don, Don Swayze.  Why didn't they just take  Don Swayze's pancreas  and put it in Patrick?  They tried.  Dominant the hiding.  He knew it was up.  Look at him.  It looks like Patrick Swayze, 
[02:32:30]  but they put his head  in a vice a little bit  and squished it down.  Good point, Kenny.  Kenny raised a good one.  Oh, Kenny?  Frank Stallone.  Frank Stallone.  Greatest lesser brother  of all time.  That is a biggie, man.  Yeah, he's a big one, dude.  That's a biggie.  I don't think he beats  Clint Howard,  to tell you the truth.  Wait a minute.  Oh, fuck.  We got some competition.  Look at that head of hair  on him there.  He almost looks like Slyze.  It's just off.  It's just off of Slyze  in that picture.  He wanted to.  I'll tell you another  greater, younger, 
[02:33:00]  lesser brother  who became a greater brother.  Brother Joe?  Joseph Simmons.  No, Russell Simmons.  Russell Simmons?  Russell Simmons.  He was the lesser brother.  Well, he was Run's brother  of Run DMC.  All right.  And he started Def Jam Records.  But for years,  I think him and Rick Rubin did,  but nobody knew  who Joseph Simmons,  I mean, Russell Simmons was  other than the occasional mention.  And then Def Jam happened,  and he was a behind-the-scenes guy,  but now he's more famous 
[02:33:30]  than fucking Run almost.  That's true.  Oh, that's so, yeah.  But he is black.  He's no Clint Howard.  Well, you know.  But Daniel Baldwin.  Oh, we all just decided  not to acknowledge  all those Baldwins.  Hey, Billy Carter,  Billy Carter,  greatest lesser brother  of all time.  Yeah.  Drunk.  Billy Beer.  Yeah.  Billy Beer.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  How about Lee Harvey Oswald?  Everybody knows.  His older brother,  Hank Oswald,  was a very favorite.  He was a Dallas hat salesman. 
[02:34:00]  And Lee hated it.  I bet.  And hated all things hats.  That's all that was about.  Okay.  He was aiming for Jackie's hat  and he pissed.  That stupid pillbox hat.  He just wanted to see it go  flying off her head.  He fucking,  he created,  I hate hats.com.  No one knew what it was.  Might have to go Robert Kennedy  for the win.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  That wacky,  almost JFK look. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Hey, can we play  A-Rod getting booed?  Yeah.  We can do the greater  lesser brother.  By the end of the deck,  card,  we will send a man  to the moon  and do those other things.  It's like,  what are those other things?  He was too busy,  you know.  Look at that pussy.  We will send a man  to the moon  and whatever other  horse shit you want to do.  I got a whore  waiting for me.  I can't finish my speech.  I just do the other things. 
[02:35:00]  Bring it on the whore.  Right, exactly.  Where's Mimi?  We need more here, sir.  Nah!  Those other things.  The moon.  Other things.  Bring the whore.  Ah, Jim Belushi.  Greater or lesser brother  of all time.  Robert Kennedy  hasn't murdered.  You're right.  There's no one  better than Robert Kennedy.  I'm going Clint Howard  for the win.  I think Clint Howard  beats Robert Kennedy.  For the win.  Same in Apollo 13.  Maybe if they're  racing through the kitchen.  And now it's on 
[02:35:30]  to Chicago.  Exactly.  Unless my head  is fucking blasted  right by some dinner rolls.  And the last thing I see  is Thousand Island  Caesar salad dressing.  Fucking sickening.  Try plugging the hole  with croutons.  Literally almost  a more depressing  kill than JFK  was RFK.  I watched a documentary  on him recently.  It's just  Sirhan Sirhan  should have  they literally  should have  taken a knife  and cut him open 
[02:36:00]  from the fucking  pubic area  up to his throat.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way  totally off subject.  I watched a video  last night  never before bed again  will I watch a video  called  Man Destroys Face  in Attempted Suicide  with Shotgun.  Oh, thank you.  All I'm thinking  is why  Did you not know  what it was going to be?  Yeah, I thought  it was a comedy thing  with a little porn  mixed in.  Like a fucking cartoon.  Why would they  because it's footage  taken by a doctor  and he's on an operating  table and they're  trying to save him  and I'm like 
[02:36:30]  why don't they  just kill this guy?  Like let him die  because he has  Oh, fuck.  Was it just  a hole in his face?  It's his  his face  I'll show you  I do not want  to see it  I don't even  want to see it  No desire whatsoever  I've watched that  and I've thought  God almighty  I would never  shoot myself in the head  because occasionally  they miss  Oh, boy  Yeah, I can imagine  what it looks like  It's the worst thing  I've ever seen  Why would you watch it?  Because now I know 
[02:37:00]  like I've thought  of suicide many times  and I felt like  my God  I would never do that  Never  That's why you got  to do it multiple times  Dude, that fucking  All I can think  of while I'm watching this  because they're putting  a breathing tube in  is what is this guy  feeling?  Like the confusion  He's probably so mad  at himself  What did I do?  Are you even thinking  that way?  I'm like Superman  His nose, his teeth  his mouth are gone  his eyes are gone  He's just in the head  feeling something  Like it's just  all these brain things  Like what's going  through this fucking  horribly disfigured head?  Why do you do that 
[02:37:30]  to yourself?  I would take  Jimmy  I'm talking about Jimmy  watching that  I would take Excedrin  Yeah, you think Excedrin  would stop that?  Excedrin works really well  It works well  And you wouldn't even  have to swallow  You just put it in  the hole in your face  and it dissolves  Dude, you can't even breathe  No  You can't sniffle  You can't pick your nose  Alright, let's do the A-Rod  I'll show you  Because we got Ty West  Ty West don't want to see  in a movie  Yeah, the show's backing up  here though  Let's do some A-Rod  and then we get Ty West  in here  Oh boy 
[02:38:00]  Wow  Holy shit  Are they bullying him  Did he hit a home run 
[02:38:30]  and shut the crowd up?  Yeah  Oh god  Too good  Ball one  That one  high for ball one  The fans here  not appreciating  I don't know what he did 
[02:39:00]  with this at bat  I'm hoping  Stepped out of the blocks  I don't know  Alright  Here goes the pitch  Low  Ball two  2-0  That's low  and inside  2-0 count  A-Rod steps out of the box  And a bunch of people  taking pictures  Goodness gracious  Yeah  Oh boy  A lot of attention  And a  Set and 
[02:39:30]  pitch  And he flies out  to left field  and charging in  And it's dropped  And it's dropped  And it's stuck in his asshole  He rolls over the ball  Oh my god  He gets a  A bloop single  A bloop single  A bloop single  Drops  An 0 for 3  after that  What do you think  it's like to know  you're the most hated  person in baseball  Depends on why  Like with Ty Cobb  He was the best  so he probably didn't care  He doesn't give a fuck  He looks at his bank account  and goes  Boo all the fuck you want  He does care 
[02:40:00]  That's why he's fighting  Yeah  That's true  He's fighting for his legacy  He's fighting for money  His legacy  Yeah but he wants  his honesty too  He's fighting for the rest  of his money  When you know they're coming  Maybe in the home run record  No he's got no chance  He doesn't give a fuck  about the home run  He's got no chance  at that  He doesn't have a chance anymore  No he's a broken down  38 year old  He's got no chance  Still I got no chance  No chance  A-Rod after the game  Thank you for being here today  Thank you for being here today  I know I wish it was  under different circumstances  But I want to express to you guys 
[02:40:30]  and the fans of baseball  that the last seven months  has been a nightmare  It's been  Come on  A nightmare  Yeah  Fucking models all over the place  Yeah yeah  Relaxing  Someone had learned his lesson  The first time  Could someone  And I'm serious  Can you put a price tag  on his nightmare  Please  I need to know  Seven months  How much fucking money  A-Rod made  As he's looking at it  At it as a nightmare 
[02:41:00]  A couple grand  No  What does he make a year nowadays  It's different every year  The way his contracts  is structured  I could find out  I'm going to keep talking  I bet you could find out  It's a million dollars  a month minimum right  Oh yeah  Okay  So seven months  would be seven million minimum  Poor guy  Is that a nightmare  to anybody  That's way more than that  He probably makes  30 million a year  It's 28 million  Alright 28 million  So  How long is it  Seven  Four million a month  So that's  No  Two plus million a month 
[02:41:30]  Yeah  So  2.3  2.3  So times seven  16.3  How do you even live off that  16-ish  Terrible  His nightmare  Cost him 16 million dollars  Meaning cost  Meaning he got  Yeah  A nightmare  It's been  You know  Probably the worst time  of my life  For sure  Obviously for the circumstances  That are at hand  And also dealing with  A very  Tough surgery 
[02:42:00]  In a rehab program  And being 38  I am thrilled  And humbled  To have the opportunity  To put on this uniform again  I will humble you  And to play Major League Baseball again  With the camel clutch  I humble you  Cocksuck  He is so  Why is he so hated 
[02:42:30]  Like I want  Is it because  He didn't perform  Or because  You know what it was  He came off like  Such a cocksucker  He's a greedy  Too much money  Being paid  For  A complete lack  Of performance  But it does bother  There's no one  That doesn't care  That they're being booed  And hated that  He knows he's a hated guy  Yeah  He is  He's a very greedy  I feel like  Yeah  Like I was 18 years old  Back in Fenway Park  In 1994  When I went into  The Red Sox 
[02:43:00]  For the very first time  Oh  And  It's been 20 years  Did you choke then?  Just very excited  To have the opportunity  To go out there  And play baseball  And help my team win  And prove to myself  It's like  Bizarro Jeter  He's Bizarro Jeter  Fans of New York  Just fucking  Can't perform  Fans of baseball  He fucking  His personal life  Is a shambles  He's fucked  Professionally  He's a  Cheat  And asswipe 
[02:43:30]  And then you got  Cheater  Who's just  This fucking  Baseball sweetheart  That son of the bitch  Really does come through  In big situations  The best was him  Coming back  From the fucking DL  And just smashing  A home run  First pitch  He's one of the  Greatest players of all time  He really is  He's one of the  Best players ever  You'd be hard pressed  To get a legitimate  Argument of that  I think he's  Is there a better  Shortstop in baseball  History than Jeter  As far as production  And team leadership  Bucky Dent  Well yeah I mean  Obviously the home run  Power of Bucky Dent 
[02:44:00]  I mean when you can  Put four or five  Home runs a year  Over the fence  Who's going to argue  With that  Barely  248 lifetime  Batting average  I mean that's obvious  Number 20  Good old  Bucky Dent  Bucky Dent  It's one three run  Home run in 1978  We're still talking about him  That was a big one  He was revelated  To Bucky Tooth  That cocksucker  Go ahead  I'm not saying  That anyone  Is making anything up  I'm not saying  Anything about  MLB  Or anything  That's going on  I am saying  That we have a process  This is America  You have an opportunity  To defend yourself  And I think  The process  Like all of us 
[02:44:30]  Americans  Will have an opportunity  To defend ourselves  In a due process  And I think  That's what we have today  And I'll have my day  Alright so  He's going to lose  Between 30 and 33 million dollars  During his suspension  So he wants that money  Obviously  Oh yeah  And then  Someone's saying  He's hated  Because he's stiff servers  Too good for anyone  Shitty personality  Yeah  I've got to get  A little personality  There's lots of reasons  To hate him  There's not just  You know  We've got to take a break

That's pretty cool 
[02:46:30]  I'm in both  I'm trying to expand my horizons here  Yeah?  Nice  As actor  Actor  Yeah, I'm in two movies actually  That come out the same day  So I figure if you're going to do it  It's like, you know  Go big or go home  Yeah, yeah  So I'm in a movie called  You're Next  That comes out August 23rd  That you're probably seeing  I see all  Yeah  It looks very scary  And then I'm in a movie called  Drinking Buddies  With Olivia Wilde  And Anna Kendrick  And Jake Johnson from New Girl  And that also comes out the 23rd  And that's on VOD right now  So that one you can watch  Video on demand 
[02:47:00]  Yes, and that's like a  It's a rom-com  Oh, shit  You're in a rom-com  Craft beer  And relationships  Oh, man  How do you  How do you  I play the dickhead  That works at the brewery  Oh, okay  A little comic relief?  Yeah, a little bit  And more just sort of  I'm kind of the bad guy in the movie  And I'm the one that  Kind of no one really likes  Oh, but a little more  Calm than rom for you?  It is a bit more calm  More calm  Well, actually  I don't want to give too much away  But I do have some rom in this movie 
[02:47:30]  And it gets me in a lot of trouble  Do you get to do any kissing scenes?  I don't want to give too much away  But I do have  Do you have any scenes as hot as like  Kevin Bacon got in The Woodsman?  Yeah, I'm like the kid in The Woodsman  Yeah  I'm a woodsman  But yes, no  I do  I get a little action in the movie  So I  One of my best friends  Who's actually in Your Next also  And is in my new movie  He directed that movie  So this is a very incestuous group  Yeah, there is a lot going on 
[02:48:00]  If we just work with each other  Then we'll just keep having jobs  And you keep working  Yeah, yeah, absolutely  So he's one of my best friends  And he cast me as the asshole  So  What's going on with this relationship?  Oh  I'm just auditioning  Letting time out that I can do it  That is pretty good  Yeah  Very believable  What are you leaving me for another guy?  Now, very scary  I've seen the trailer  Yes  What is this?  Home Invasion  It is  So Your Next is a movie  That a friend of mine  Adam Wingard made  And we made it two and a half years ago 
[02:48:30]  So it's kind of weird  That it's coming out now  But it's a great movie  And it's pretty crazy  So it's a Home Invasion movie  That's, you know  Kind of as we all know  A group of family gets together  At this house  For like a reunion  And then the bad guys show up  But  They should have guns  The twist  Fuck yeah  The twist in the movie  That's like what people like about it  Yeah  Is that the  The girlfriend  The son has brought home  To meet his family  Has this background  That she's this sort of like  Ex-survivalist 
[02:49:00]  So  That's sort of the twist  The bad guys show up  But  You know  The people in the house  Are a problem  They didn't bank on this happening  So yeah  It's almost like this  It's kind of like this crazy  Horror home alone  Sort of movie  Right, right  Where people in the house  Fight back  But it's pretty wild  It looked very scary  With the masks on  And stuff  I think how scary  I don't get scared that easily  And the movie you did  That scene  Of her being chased  Through that basement  Towards the end  Was a creepy  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
[02:49:30]  Fucking scene  Like I thought of that recently  For some reason  Watching The Conjuring  Which was pretty frightening  In moments  Yeah, it has some great  Great set piece  Scary moments  They showed too much  In the trailer  Which really wrecked it  But that scene  Where she's being chased  Really was fucking creepy  The old guy coming after her  Inkeepers, yeah  Yeah, I'm sorry  That was the inkeeper  Yeah, that was fucking creepy  Yeah  Yeah, the old guy  Like he'd just show up  In the light a little bit  Yeah  That's the shit  That is scary  Like blood and guts  And stuff doesn't really  Fuck me up 
[02:50:00]  I watch it  It's like  Eh  But that  When someone moves  In a way that isn't  They're not supposed to move  Like their arm turns backwards  Or they're on the ceiling  Yeah  That shit still fucks me up  Yeah, I think it's the stuff  I mean  It's the stuff that you think might  Like  The violent stuff is like  Well, at least I'll see it coming  Or I won't  And I won't matter  Right  But the like creepy ghost stuff  And I think that's why people think  The Conjuring is so scary  Is like  What if I come home  And I open my closet  And that  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Even though it doesn't make sense  It's just that like  Ways on you 
[02:50:30]  And I think that's pretty scary  I'd be so used to hearing this  From all of my years  In stand-up  Oh  I mean that brief  Yes, that's it  That's all you get  Exactly  You're next  Yeah, there's  I saw The Conjuring also  And it's kind of  It wasn't as scary  As I thought it was gonna be  It might have been  A little overhyped  Yes, I think so  I think everybody  Kind of came out of it  Saying it's going to be  The scariest movie  You've ever seen  Yeah  Which is a little unfair  I think it is scary  But it's  Yeah, yeah  You went in thinking like  I'm gonna have a heart attack  Yeah, yeah  Very fucking scary  And then it was kind of like 
[02:51:00]  Alright, I can get  It's made a hundred million dollars  Which is pretty  Yeah, huge  Wild  I get like  Scary at the jumpy things  Things that jump out  Like that  And in The Conjuring  There was that scene  With the little music box  Yeah  And the mirror  And it's like  Oh, there's nothing behind me  And it just shuts the thing  It's right in front  That right in front of your face  Shit  Oh, that would get me  Every goddamn time  The one that got everyone  In the theater  When I saw was  When she's  She's in the room  And they're like  Looking at the closet  And then all of a sudden  It's on top of the closet  And then like zoomed in 
[02:51:30]  That was a doozy for everyone  That was very fucking frightening  Thank God they showed it in the trailer  So I knew it was coming  Yeah, I know  It's such a weird thing with trailers  Because I know they want to convey  What's in the movie  And kind of get the storyline  Just so you're interested  But you can fuck it up so easily  By giving too much away  It's hard  Because it's like  You've got to sell the movie  As strong as you can  To get people to come see it  And if that works  Ultimately the downside  Is that people know too much 
[02:52:00]  About the movie  But if you don't do that  They might not come  So it's  That's true  Marketing a movie is really  It's tricky  And very few people  Are really good at it  Yeah  There's that movie out now  With fucking Marky Mark  And Denzel  And stuff  Double guns  I think it is  Double guns, right?  Fuck yeah  Jesus  Chip would name the movie  Pretty good  Double guns  You should have been  Doing the marketing  Yeah  It's just double guns  It's called two guns  Yeah it is two guns  I like double guns better 
[02:52:30]  That would have been better  Chip  Yeah no one says that  After a fucking thing  Two guns  It's funny  It uh  That movie  Now I don't know  If it's a reveal  Or what have you  But watching the trailer  You find out  That these two guys  Think that they're  In like  They're bad guys  And one turns out  To be like  Army intelligence guy  The other guy  Turns out to be like  FBI or something  And it's a reveal  Like  That should be a big moment  In a movie  Like holy fuck  They're both good guys 
[02:53:00]  Yeah I gotta believe  That that's in the first  Ten minutes of the movie  That it's like  Otherwise  But who knows  I mean  It could be the big reveal  I've seen trailers  Where it's like  Wow  That's a huge plot twist  Yeah  And you just showed it  So now when I watch this  The whole beginning  I'm gonna know  That that happens  Which  But then there's other times  Like so the movie  I'm in the city now  Finishing a new movie  And I finished next week  And then we premiered  Venice and then Toronto  And it's  I did it with Vice  And so it's like  It's like Vice's show 
[02:53:30]  It's like Vice goes  To this commune  To do a story about it  And it ends up  Being like Jonestown  And they get stuck  In the middle of this  Big mass suicide  But that's a movie  Where it's like  You can't keep  The mass suicide secret  Right  But then it's like  But if they know  The mass suicide  A lot of people  Are gonna die  But that's kind of  What makes the first half  Of the movie  Intense  Because it's like  You know where it's going  But how is it gonna get there  That's true  You can know how  Something's gonna end  And then  And then they kind of  Go back and show  What happens  They do that a lot  In Breaking Bad  Yeah  You have the flash forward  You know what's gonna happen 
[02:54:00]  But then you're like  Alright  How does that happen  Yeah  So you could get away  With that part of it  But I've just seen  Movie trailers  Destroy movies  Yeah  No it's true  It can be really tricky  It's funny  Because again  You're next  We made it so long ago  That to see the trailers  And they're popping up  All over TV now  Which is  And it's like  All my idiot friends  In the movie  So I'm just like  There's Joe  And there's AJ  And it's really funny  To see everybody on TV  And it's such an intense trailer  It's  Yeah  It's weird to be a part of that  And see it  So mass marketed in a way 
[02:54:30]  And it's  With all your  Like every one of that movie  Are people I hang out with  All this time  That's hilarious  And have for the last ten years  Yeah  So it's really great to be like  Oh this one  Happened to punch through  On this really weird  Mainstream level  And it's exciting to see that  Yeah that is kind of  And how does that happen  Like what was it about this  That  Well it was that  Adam had been  We'd all been making movies together  And then he got  Like a little bit more money  Not a lot of money  To make this movie  And he was just like  Well I'll just make it with you guys  Because I know at least  What we'll get out of it  Yeah  And so we were like  Whatever  And we just kind of went to Missouri 
[02:55:00]  And made it  And now here we are  So it's one of those things  That I don't  I don't want to say  That people didn't think  It was going to be this  But it was just like  Yep I'm going to go spend a week in Missouri  That's about as much  As we sort of thought of it  And hang out  Do some karaoke  And you know  It's a college town  Have a good time  And that'll be that  You're a big karaoke guy  I am  I do enjoy it  Can you sing?  I can sing karaoke  Yeah yeah yeah  As in like  I'm not  I'm good at karaoke  But I'm not a great singer  Outside of that  I was a decent singer  In high school 
[02:55:30]  I was in a band  And then I'm just like  Why am I doing this?  You were not  I was so  You were in a band?  Yes  You were a singer in a band  I was  It's embarrassing  All right  He's such a fuck  No he's telling the truth  What was the band's name?  Guns and Sunflowers  And I was  If you were even  Those guys  No those guys left  And went out to LA  And got another singer  Oh  And they changed the sunflowers parts  Oh  Wow 
[02:56:00]  So you were the original singer  Of Guns and Roses  Well it was Guns and Sunflowers  When I was in it  Yeah  It was just different  Sure  Yeah  Paradise Town  Was just  A little song we did  You know  He's a fucking  Asshole  No it wasn't  I don't think this is true  It is true  Right  Absolutely  Welcome to the woods  No it's  They changed it  They stole my shit  Sir  You're the Pete Best  Of Guns and Roses  Yeah  Maybe 
[02:56:30]  Where the fucking  Bon Scott  Really  I just meant  There's a one off line  No no  Not an eight minute bomb  I didn't mean this  To be an interview  I'm delving  I'm delving  We kind of want to  Explore Guns and Sunflowers  Yeah  They're good  So you have a song  Like Welcome to the Jungle  I was trying to bring  Natasha in today  Yes  Oh yeah what happened  Oh she flaked on me  No she  They started shooting  Second season last week  And so she was on hold 
[02:57:00]  For today  And she was like  It might or it might not  And then last night  She couldn't do it  But she 100% will come in  Yeah I think we're going  To have her in  She seems really good  Natasha Lyonne  Orange is the New Black  Orange is the New Black  And American Pie  And Pee Wee's Playhouse  Yeah  She's great  I was like  We were talking last week  And she was psyched  And then at the last minute  Sadly she couldn't do it  Yeah yeah  I told her that  I was like  No matter what publicists say  Go in and do the show  She'll fit in well  She seems like a lot of fun  She is  She's great  She's very quick  She'll be 
[02:57:30]  Yeah yeah  Yeah  I really used to like her a lot  Like I had like a little crush on her and stuff  She's very charming  I think when she comes in here  You'll be  She can  Because I think a lot of actresses  Are just sort of like  Kind of boring sometimes  Yeah  Or they're just sort of reserved  Or afraid of doing this  And she's not like that  She's just like  What's going on here guy  Come on  I'm your mother  I can talk about this  What's happening  She's very animated  Yeah I'd love to have her in  To hang with  I saw her  I think she showed up  At one of the  Yeah yeah  When I went to go see  What the hell movie was it 
[02:58:00]  Oh Inkupers  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah  And she was  She was at that one  I was like  Oh look  Yeah I told my friend PJ  Because I know you guys love  The Wire so much  He was Ziggy on The Wire  He's in a new show  On AMC  That's coming out  James  Yeah  That guy's good  They used my cock  In that second season  Looked good  Also in The Hangover  It's a different angle  Yeah  He's great that guy  Dude that Ziggy character  I watched that sometime  And he's so 
[02:58:30]  Absolutely hateable  And irritating  Like that son of a bitch  Played that role  So well man  He's great  Yeah  He's on a new show  Called Low Winter Sun  That starts after Breaking Bad  It's a new AMC show  That's kind of Wire-ish  Okay  And he's sort of like  One of the leads on that show  So but he lives here  And he'd come in  Oh that'd be great  Hey my man  What are you doing  He's trying to talk to cheese  Oh that was so embarrassing  The dumb jacket  He told you not to spend the money  Ziggy  Get that dog shit  Two thousand dollar coat  The fuck you doing 
[02:59:00]  That was fucking terrible  Oh was he good man  Oh was he fucking good  That was a great series man  Season two got shit on  So much  Because it was the first time  They departed  From what we  Because it was only season two  Yeah  And it was so underrated  When you watch that again  And when he fucking  Pulls out that pistol  And shoots that Greek  And then his only correction is  Can you say begged  He begged  Oh was that funny  I think it's the best season  Because it has this  Best season  It has this like  Over  There's like a mystery  To the whole season  And the rest don't have that  The rest are just  You're kind of moving along  With the characters 
[02:59:30]  And the overall narrative  Of the show  But season two has the mystery  Of like  Who's in the crate  How'd this get there  And then all the other stuff  And I think it's  What's great about it  Is the departure  To show that like  There's  That was the first time  You went like  Oh the show is more  About drugs  Than it is just  The sort of drug dealers  It's about the bigger picture  And I think that's what  Made the show  Really pretty amazing  One of my favorite  Wire scenes  Is in that season two  Not all of them  But when Omar shoots  Brother Muzon in the stomach  That's one of my favorite  Scenes in the whole series  Oh right  That was a great  Fucking scene  Yeah 
[03:00:00]  Yeah  I was watching  Yesterday  Like a one off  Episode of Lost  Muzon  Oh wow  So I'm watching  And I'm just  As I'm watching it  I'm kind of going like  This show is a little  Kind of goofy  And silly now  I think it's ruined  You watch it now  Yes  Why is it ruined?  You can't  I think everybody  Disliked the end so much  And it was such a  What's going to happen show  That when it was finally done  The idea of going back  And watching Lost  Is like fuck you  It had zero rewatchability 
[03:00:30]  Wow  Yeah  No kidding  Fucked up  Maybe the first season  If you were showing  To someone who didn't know  But at the same time  It's all just  You know it's leading up  To like  Even though I love  That last season  Scene with the father  The Christian  I thought was great  In that season  In that scene  But I agree  I didn't love the ending  Well you guys all  Made fun of me  For not watching Lost  Now you win in the end  Who's the big winner now  When it was on  Who's the big winner now  It was very cool to watch  Not one episode  I liked watching it  Not a one  And that's the truth 
[03:01:00]  But going back  And just watching  A random episode now  You're like  Ugh  You know  Everyone's pulling their guns out  And pointing it  Into the jungle  And like the characters  Is so over the top  Well there's also like  There's not much to that show  Other than the plot  No  Like it's a very plot  Only kind of show  Right  The Wire is about  All sorts of social commentary  And themes  And thank god  It never got nominated  For any Emmys  Except for writing  In season 5  Yeah right  So happy it didn't  House  Now that's a drama 
[03:01:30]  Hollywood should literally  Fucking  If I could just  If I could put AIDS  In a fucking  In a crop duster  And fly it over  Those Emmy voting cunts  That would be nice  Certainly would be  AIDS  Have you  I know I mentioned  This to you the other day  But have you guys seen  Or talked about  Active Killing yet  I've talked about  They didn't want to hear  Oh man yeah  I watched the trailer  For that  That is so fucked up  Explain what it is  Cause it's amazing  It's a documentary  That's out now  And it's  It's an amazing movie  To see  But I really think  It's sort of  Almost like a duty 
[03:02:00]  To go see this movie  Because it's unlike  Anything you'll ever see  Ever in your life  It's a documentary  That this guy made  While he was living  In Indonesia  And he was trying  To make a documentary  About forming unions  And it's like  A totally fucked up country  And it's illegal  To form unions  And everyone's afraid  To do it  Because if they do  They're afraid  That this sort of  Genocide from the 60s  Will come back  And they could all be murdered  And it's just such  A corrupt country  But while he was making  That movie  He got to learn  About this genocide  There were hundreds  And hundreds of thousands  Of communists  Which are just like  Chinese people  Were killed  Like women and children  And everything  In the 60s 
[03:02:30]  And it's not really  A widely talked about  Sort of massacre  But it was happening  There was death squads  And it was a really  Horrific thing  So he was like  Wow, maybe I'll make  A movie about that  Because people don't  Know about that  But he was having  A really hard time  Getting anyone  To talk about it  Because they were  So afraid  The country's still  So afraid  That it could happen again  So everyone's like  Yeah, I don't really  Want to go down that road  And then the people  Said to him  You know, you'd have  A better chance  Talking to the killers  So he tracks down  These guys who are  In their 60s  They're like  Grandparents now  And they were like  The heads of the 
[03:03:00]  Death squads  Wow  And the thing is  These guys  Really killed  Millions of people  And they're  Totally psyched  About it  Yeah  And they've never  Been punished  And the country  Doesn't see it  As a problem  So they're happy  To talk about it  And they're happy  Not only to talk about it  But he convinced them  That the best way  To explain  What they did  Was to reenact it  In a movie  Yeah  So he gets  The real murderers  To dress up in costumes  With special effects  And show how they  Rape and murder  Children  And kill people  And it's  Are you auditioning  For that?  No, Uncle Paul 
[03:03:30]  Ty  No, Uncle  Help me out  Paul  It's just  It is like  One of the  And that's kind of  The hook  Is that like  Oh my god  They dress up in the costumes  But what's amazing  About the movie  Is to see these conversations  With these people  Who are so disconnected  From humanity  And that  Because it just  Happened  Because they were  Never punished for it  They don't know  That killing all those  People was wrong  Was wrong  And they don't know  That showing you  How they killed people  And showing you  How they did it  With less blood  That that's fucked up  And they  They openly discuss it  And then there's  Victims from  They're like  Hanging out with the victims 
[03:04:00]  And the victim's like  Yeah, you killed my father  And I had to bury him  Along the side of the road  In the middle of the night  And you ruined my life  Wasn't that crazy?  Wasn't that cool  When you did that?  Because he's still so afraid  That they might turn on him  Oh man  And it's  You just could never make that movie  Because that shouldn't exist  And so the fact that it's there  It's like you watch it  With your jaw on the floor  It's not a particularly  Enjoyable movie to watch  It's not  There's not a lot  There's no real graphic footage  Of any sort of real killings  Right, right  But just hearing them  Discuss it  And hearing them reenact it  And having them put little kids  In the reenactments  And seeing it traumatize 
[03:04:30]  The little kids  Is just  It's totally unreal  With zero remorse  None  And to see the way  That they  Like they go on talk shows  Like  Instead of like me  Coming in here  To be like  I'm in your next  They'd be in here like  Yep, we killed all those Chinese  The country's fine with it  And so  I think the movie is  One, really incredible  Because it's fascinating  Two, it's really incredible  Because it's unlike anything  You'll see ever again  Yeah, yeah  And three, like  It  I  I don't want to say  Like something should be done  Like they should be taken to the Hague  But there's an element of like  Something should be done 
[03:05:00]  Yeah  Because of what you're seeing  But it never will be  I mean  And I think if that movie  Doesn't win the best documentary Oscar  Then it's just  It's all worthless  Because  Not only is it amazing  You'll just never get a movie  Like that  Yeah, yeah  Because how could you  But I know that  A lot of the Academy screenings  Like a lot of people walk out  Because it's just so  It's bleak  And the last scene in the movie  Like when I saw it  Like you're just sweating  The whole movie  And even though you don't really  See anything in it  Just hearing these people  Talk about it  And realizing it's real  Is like overwhelming  And it's too much  For a lot of people 
[03:05:30]  And the last scene  Is just so unbelievably intense  Yeah  And it's  It's a real  It's a crazy movie  Even  How do you even decide to  Go like  Yeah, let's have the  Actual killers  Reenact  Like it seems like  Such a  Ridiculous idea  It is  But they're like  Tap dancing  Like  And they're talking about  How they killed everybody  And they're just  The fact that they have  No remorse  And at some time  He doesn't interject very often  But the director  Every once in a while  Would be like  But you know  Like there's a scene  In the movie  Where the guy 
[03:06:00]  Maybe starts to realize  That like  What I did was wrong  And he's like  Because he's reenacting it  And reenacting it  Was kind of hard for him  And he's like  Oh, I know what it's like now  What people felt  When I was doing this  And he's like  No, no  You were really killing them  Not just pretending  And he's like  No, I think I understand  And it's just like  Oh, yeah, yeah  Oh, my God  But it's  It's a really  Holy fuck  It's a  It's a sort of  Once in a lifetime  Kind of movie  And so  I think it's  It's absolutely worth seeing  Because I think it's pretty brilliant  But it's  It's just 
[03:06:30]  Sam's got the trailer going  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's pretty wild  It is really twisted, man  Cool  Yeah, highly recommend that  But your movie  Yes  Back to it  When does it open?  Well, so your next  Comes out August 23rd  And I believe that's a Friday  Wide  That's probably how it comes out  Friday  Wide  And so we're all very excited about that  And then Drinking Buddies  The other film that I'm in  Also comes out August 23rd  So we're competing with each other  And  But that one is also on video demand right now 
[03:07:00]  And then tonight  I'm going to go to a screening of that  At BAM Cinematheque  For Rooftop Films  I believe it's sold out  There is a standby line  But that's tonight at 8  In Fort Greene  You can go to  Rooftopfilms.com  To find out about that  I think some of the cast  Will be there for a Q&A  What other acting have you done?  This is pretty much it  Is this really?  Yeah, I mean  It's one of these weird things  Where two of my friends  Put me in a movie  As like the idiot  Yeah, yeah  And then both those movies  Happen to do really well  I am so fucking  Gonna get this on demand  When I go home  Yeah, it's a good movie  I just want to see  It's like, ah, look 
[03:07:30]  It's a great movie  It's about like  Chicago and it's a craft  My friend became obsessed  With craft beer  Which I don't even like craft beer  And we all drank real beer  The whole movie  So it was just like  A headache all day long  Oh shit, right?  Uh-oh  Does it taste like cheese?  Why?  It's fucking craft  Cocksucker  What happened?  He's just, he's  He's terrible  He's just terrible  So we work at the brewery  Thank you  And so it's like  Olivia Wilde  Is sort of the PR manager  Of the brewery  And she kind of has a 
[03:08:00]  Crush on one of the guys  Who works at the brewery  Who's Jake Johnson  From that show New Girl  And they have like  A thing with each other  But they're both in relationships  And so  It's like, oh  What's gonna happen?  And then at one point  Olivia Wilde  Gets out of her relationship  And so it's like  Jake Johnson's still in his  Oh boy  It's like, but is this the moment?  And so it's kind of  That sort of work  Relationship environment  Here comes the home wrecker  And I play Dave  Yeah  The guy that no one really likes  At the brewery  Who is just sort of  A bum out  Yeah  I kind of come in  And just kind of ruin things  I am absolutely going to 
[03:08:30]  Get that video on the man  Yes, it's a good  I guess it's a rom-com  So it's a good  If you watch it with a lady friend  They'd probably like it  And it's  There you are right there  On the screen there  It's a good look for me  He gets shot in the head  Yes, this trailer for your next  Gives away that I am not in the movie  For that last  He gets shot in the head  I went to see The Conjuring this weekend  And he was  This is attached to it  And I was just telling him outside  It was  I would go  Oh, it's Ty  He's in the movie  But in the trailer 
[03:09:00]  He gets shot in the head  With an arrow  Jesus Christ  Okay, well  So maybe he's doing  The Steve Martin story  Yeah, true  True  He might  No  I thought that deserves  Something  Simply for speed  It's a very flattering wardrobe  They put me in as well  Yeah, that looks great  That's when I showed up  And they gave me that scarf  And it was like  Oh, we're making a comedy  That's what I mean  I kind of realized the movie  And the movie is pretty  It's like a whack 
[03:09:30]  Like I said  It's sort of like this  Crazy Home Alone movie  In that it is  There's a lot of humor  In the movie as well  And that scarf  Is a big part of it  A big part of the humor  We shot that scene  At the dinner table  Which is where I get shot  For what seemed like forever  Yeah  And I've made  Since I'm not an actor  And I should know better  From making movies  But like a dumbass  I just kept eating the food  And drinking the stuff  In every scene  And then Adam did like  900 takes  So I probably  It just  It was a rough  Yeah  It was gross  But yeah  I'm excited about that movie  It's a fun movie 
[03:10:00]  Very cool  Great man  And then my last thing  I can plug  Is that my own movie  Yes  Back in  It's been a year  Of being quiet  Because when you make a movie  It's very traumatic  And your life is miserable  I see your tweets  Every so often  And it's like  Oh fuck  Yeah  I leave here  And I go  Finish color correcting  That movie is the movie  It's called The Sacraments  And that's the movie  About the vice  It's like vice guide  To Jonestown  For lack of a better term  And so I'm very excited  About that  And that premieres at Venice  At the end of the month  Which is very prestigious  Which is fun for me  And then we go to Toronto  Right after that  And yeah 
[03:10:30]  I'm looking forward to it  It's a cool movie  It's a horrific movie  But it's  You know  It's like if you made  A Jonestown movie  I don't know  If you'd necessarily  Call that a horror movie  Yeah  It is very horrific  But it doesn't  There's not like  Jumpscare  It's not that kind of movie  It's a very bleak movie  Yeah  I was reading your tweets  About you were doing  Some sound stuff  And it's like  Oh we got gurgles  Oh it's a grim movie  And fucking  You know  Just horrific music  That you got to put  Into the background  I mean it's a lot  There's a lot of old women  Dying and foaming at the mouth  And children  And it's pretty 
[03:11:00]  It's pretty bleak  Yeah  We're recording gurgling today  But it's cool though  Because I think vice  Is sort of  One of the cooler  If not the coolest  Sort of media outlet now  And they're doing  Like investigative journalism  For today  That people aren't really doing  And so I think  In the real Jonestown  What sort of set it off  Was Congressman Ryan  Going there with NBC  And the fact that there is  All this real footage  From NBC  Having been there  Right before the sort of  Mass suicide happened  To me updating it  Felt like vice  Would be the kind of people  That would be a part of that  And they were really great  So  Very cool man 
[03:11:30]  Yeah  Ty always good to have you in  Thanks for having me  Yeah let us know  When your movie comes out  I will  Yeah  I'll know a lot more  As soon as I get through Toronto  But I'm very excited about it  Very cool man  And oh what do I got  Jimmy where are you going to be  Anything  Just  Friday night  I got that  Insane Clown Posse  Gathering of the  Juggaloids gig  Oh boy  It's going to be terrific  And then while everyone's off  I go out to LA  And I'm doing a bunch of podcasts  To start promotion 
[03:12:00]  For my special  Your special  Comes out the 23rd  And by the way  Please be offended  It's on DVD  The 20th  Comedy Central is releasing it  How was that  That old lady  To make out with  You know what  Oh you saw the promo  Oh I certainly did  There's other promos coming out  She had remarkably good breath  I swear to you  Yeah  The worst part for me  Was I make out with that old lady  In the fucking promo  They cut the last part of it  You tongue  We really made out  Yeah  And there's a promo  At the end of the promo  They cut  But there's a little bit more to it  Did you fuck her? 
[03:12:30]  No  It looks like I am fucking her though  Oh  And her breath was remarkably good  For an old lady  There you go  How was she  Was she into it?  Was she like  She tolerated it  She tolerated it  I always chew gum  And there's one scene  Where she's laying on her back  And I'm making out with it  I was afraid my gum  Was going to fall in her mouth  And choke her to death  So I spit my gum out  That would have been good  Yeah  But was she like  Kissing you  Like  Tongue kissing everything  She was an actress  She was fine with it  Wow  You know what I mean?  She was fun  Yeah it was weird  She was cool  No but I'm not into older women  No shit 
[03:13:00]  Were you grossed out?  No because her breath was okay  You were turned on a little bit?  The breath  No  No but the breath is a big deal  Because it's just the mouth  What if the fucking  Old woman from The Shining in the tub  Her breath was good?  Well  At least her breath was good  You know why you're doing it  Yeah  You know why you're doing it  You're a consummate professional  Is it not showing up in a Google search  Or you're not checking for it?  Oh no I didn't check it  Oh okay  Someone told me it doesn't come up in a Google search  The Google  All right  Ope anything?  No I'm good  Damn it  Yeah  So you're not going to join us down the hall? 
[03:13:30]  It's fun getting to see it actually in person sometimes  Oh dude  Just like being at home  Just like being at home  Because I'm sitting out in their hallway  Kind of watching things go on  Watching things  Yeah well  Yeah  Yeah  There's shit going on around here  And it was right before he came in Ty  So I'm not going to lie to you  I'm extremely distracted right now  No worries  Yeah Steve Blatter  If I put off a bad vibe 
[03:14:00]  I apologize to you  But  Shouldn't you be in the south right now?  Yeah  Dollyworld?  We should be in Dollywood  Or Branson  Branson, Missouri  I ain't doing anything extra for this company  Sorry  I think  I do my job and that's it  We're supposed to go down the hall  And talk to Scott  No extra shit for the lobster  Cool  To which Opie told Steve  I'm not  You could call Bob and put him on it  Right  And if that causes a new problem so be it  Because we're convinced 
[03:14:30]  If we march down that hall  And speak to Scott  There's nothing he could tell me  I think he's going to tell us that  That Troy's fired  Yeah  That's what I think  Yeah he wants us to go down to his corner office  To tell us that Troy's fired  So I told Steve I'm not doing it  Why would I do that?  Why?  I told him everything I feel about the situation  On a phone call  Yeah  So what can he possibly say?  And then I have to sit there  And make believe what he's saying makes sense?  No  None of this makes sense  Yeah  And this was right before you came in Ty  So I apologize  No worries 
[03:15:00]  Because I like you a lot  It's always the way  But I'm so distracted  It's exhausting to be here  Because every time you get any type of traction  Going with the radio show  They're always in the way  Making it harder and harder  Coming off on the heels of a great appearance in Montreal  Everything went swimmingly  Troy was amazing in Montreal  They gotta throw this in under our fucking wheels  And then we have to go down to the office and listen to him talk  Here I have a Lionsgate film  Troy's favorites  Right  See?  Lionsgate  It's a hell of a situation 
[03:15:30]  Very frustrating  Well I guess we'll know more tomorrow  So stay tuned  We'll see you then  Thank you  Have a good rest of your day  On the rest of the shows  That are here  On the platform of this  Great radio empire  That is Sirius XM  Satellite Radio 
[03:16:00]  Oh it's got  Right  The Opie and Anthony show is available later today  With Sirius XM on demand  You've heard about it  You've waited four  Long  Hours  For it  Finally the moment is at hand  After Opie and Anthony live is coming up  Next  This  Is after Opie and Anthony live 
[03:16:30]  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Here we go  After Opie and Anthony live  Opie and Anthony are  Down at the end of the hallway  In a closed door meeting  One would assume it  Is about the fate of  Troy Kwan  But I have zero updates  You don't know anything  Do you  You rock?  No 
[03:17:00]  I avoided all of it  Yeah I mean at this point  It's better for all of us  I'd like to know  But I wasn't going to  Ask at this time  Of course  And we've all gone out of our way  To  Support Troy behind the scenes  And try to  Enforce what's really going on  And what really happened  And everything  But  You know  I don't know  I think it's out of a lot of people's hands  At this point  So  We'll have to wait and see  Hope  No it's not them  I don't know  I don't think we're going to get an update today though  Unless one of the guys tweets about it 
[03:17:30]  I don't see them coming back in here  Anytime soon  Irregardless  866-WOW1-WOW  Is the phone number  If you want to  Say something  To us  Here at After Open Anthony Live  If there is any update  I will give it to you  You know I will  But  I don't have any right now  Let me go to  937  To start  After Open Anthony Live  What's up?  Hey I'm just wondering  If  Sam feels a little bit  Responsible  For Troy's 
[03:18:00]  Responsible firing  That's a good question  That's a good question  You're on the air by the way  I am Sam  No  I don't feel responsible  For  Anything that happens to Troy  Because  I think  And if you ask Troy  He would agree with me  I think  That  Troy made his own decisions  On the air  But  As I've told people  Behind the scenes  I  Didn't think at the time  And still  To this day  Didn't see any reason  To stop what was happening  We were talking earlier  On the show  About 
[03:18:30]  You know  Threats of violence  Or whatever it was  And I don't know  What's got  What Troy did  That's gotten him  In so much trouble  I don't know  Specifically  What the issue is  I don't know  That's way over my head  But  I do know  That  As I was looking  At those two guys  Fight  It sounded  Like it could break out  In a physical altercation  At any moment  However  Being in here  And being a  Professional broadcaster  I was aware  That it was not  Going to break out  Into a physical altercation  At all 
[03:19:00]  And they were  Just  I mean  It got heated  It went over the top  But this whole channel  Is over the top  So no  And I stand by  I don't think  Anything that was said  On that show  On the air  Should get anybody fired  So I don't see why  I would have stopped it  You know  Right  Well I think it was  A great show  And keep up the good work  Thanks buddy  And it's not like  It's a conflict  That I  Went out of my way  To kind of start  It's not like I said  Oh look what's going on  Hey he said this 
[03:19:30]  Remember when he said  That way  It wasn't one of those  Situations  It was two guys  That had beef  With each other  And if you go back  And listen to it  You can hear  That I had no idea  What was happening  Until it happened  Let me go to  Chris in Michigan  What's up buddy  Front time  How you doing  You were talking about  Let's say  Miss Brothers earlier  And Chris Farley's brother  Kevin Farley  Was in the MTV  TV movie  Together  I tried to point that out  Yeah go ahead 
[03:20:00]  The amazing song  I know my tucular  I love that song  Maybe that's because  That was my generation  I tried to point out today  Yeah  Chris Farley's brother  Was in Together  But  Nobody really  Understood what I was  Talking about  I remember Together  It was a great film  It was MTV  It was the beginning  Of the 2000's  For MTV right  Yeah  And it was actually  Kind of ballsy of them  Because they made  A made for TV movie  That was  A parody of boy bands  And at the time  Boy bands were  Always making MTV  All their money  And they were  Kind of making fun of them 
[03:20:30]  So I was  I was happy about that  Kyle in Alabama  Hey man  I guess kind of  In the same vein  Of what that caller  Was talking about  Do you think  The guys wish  It would have happened  Or wish they  Would have been  In studio  Or have they  Mentioned that at all  To you  As far as like  If they would have  Handled it differently  No  Not that he handled it bad  Or do you think  It would have escalated  To where  Do you think  Blatter and  Whatever the other guy's name is  Can feel that they can  Make that judgment call  Because those guys  Weren't in there  I don't know 
[03:21:00]  I mean  I don't know  Nobody has said  Oh I wish I was in there  Nobody has a problem  With the way  I handled it  You know  I'm not saying  You handled it  I'm not saying  You handled it  Bad or good  Or you know  Anything  I think you kind of  Moderated it  The way you should have  Yeah  And I don't think  Necessarily  That it would have  Been handled differently  Anywhere else  So no  I mean nobody's thinking  Oh if it had happened  This way  If it had happened  That way  Because the bottom line  Is nobody  Thought that anybody  Would get punished  To this extent  And nobody thinks  Anybody should 
[03:21:30]  And maybe  Troy will be back tomorrow  I don't know  What's being discussed  Right now  And one last thing  Do you think  Do you think he would have  Let it get  Or he would have  Got that heated  With Ope and Anthony  And Jim in the room  Or would have gotten that  I guess  Over the top  Yeah  It would have come to blows  Or do you think  He would have kind of  No I don't think  It ever would have  Come to blows  I don't think  There's any possibility  But yeah  I think he would have  Been just as hot  If Ope and Anthony  Were in the room  Because you know  Troy gets hot headed  On the air  He plays it up 
[03:22:00]  For the air  He likes to  You know  Like for me  My thing on the air  Is I like conflict  In the sense that  I like poking people  I like prodding people  I don't spend  My days with my wife  At home  You know  Poking and prodding her  Trying to get her upset  But it's something  I like to do on the air  Because it entertains me  And I think it entertains people  Troy also likes conflict  But his idea of conflict  Is getting people  Really worked up  And over the top  And hot headed  But that's  You know  That's an on air thing  He would never 
[03:22:30]  Troy would never  Talk to me like that  Off the air  About somebody  Does that come  With the unfamiliarity  With the higher ups  Not knowing his personality  And they just kind of  Hear clips  And then they kind of  Ultimately  Jump to conclusions  And they listen to Fez  Because they're  You know  Whoever else  It's possible  I mean I don't think  I don't think this one  Is Fez's fault  I don't think he  You know  I mean in the beginning maybe  But he kind of  Laid off pretty quickly  But yeah  I think maybe  There's some unfamiliarity  And I try  I've talked to a lot 
[03:23:00]  Of people around  This building  About exactly what  Happened  And tried to  Familiarize themselves  With the situation  But I don't know  We'll see  Alright man  Appreciate it  I'll talk to you later  I don't know  I don't know  Most of these  Phone calls  I'm not gonna  Talk to  Let's go to  R.C. in Arkansas  Yeah  Sam Roberts  Yeah  Professional broadcaster  Right  And  Slavo  See 
[03:23:30]  We gotta lighten the mood  Every now and then  That call you take  Yeah  You won't take the other ones  But that one you take  Well the other ones  Are just like  Oh what about this  What about that  That guy at least  Had something new  And original  That contributed  Nothing new  Nor original  About that  I disagree  Wholeheartedly  Wholeheartedly  It was fun having  Ty West in here  Because I don't know  It's just  Anytime they get to talk  About horror movies  Is fun  That movie looks  Very scary  That he's in  The  You're next 
[03:24:00]  It looks like  That movie  The Strangers  That came out  A couple years ago  Except  Everybody's kind of  Creeping around  Outside this house  With animal masks on  And  Just wanting to kill people  And that freaks me out  Plus there's  These like  Kind of happy  But mellow songs  From the 60's  Playing on an old radio  And that's a recipe  For disaster  Because in  A certain context  It'd be a nice thing  But you know  When there's killers  Outside  It gets very  Very creepy  I went and saw 
[03:24:30]  The Conjuring  Over the weekend  And I gotta  Tell you  Jackie I think  Was the intern  That said it was scary  100% right  I had my fingers  In my mouth  The whole movie  Because I  Like I was  I was biting  My fingers  And I  Three fingers  In my mouth  At once  I had no idea  I could fit that much  Bill Burr tweeted yesterday  He just went and saw it as well  And said it was really good  He liked it right  Yeah  It was great  It was really well done  And it was funny  Because it is  Like based on a true story 
[03:25:00]  But there's almost  No documentation  On it  So you can kind of  Just paint the picture  How you're gonna paint them  But I got creeped out by it  I did a YouTube  Movie review of it  Yesterday  I'm starting to  Think I'm losing my mind  Because I did this  YouTube movie review  Of The Conjuring  But when I'm doing this  It's just  And I guess it's kind of  Like this show  On days like today  Where it's just me  In a studio  Kind of talking to the audience  I'm sitting there  Jess wasn't home 
[03:25:30]  She's out of town  So I'm just sitting there  Trying to figure out  What to do with myself  And I start writing  And I set up  A little camera  On a tripod  And I set up  The microphone  And I get my  You know  Shirt and tie on  For the video  And I'm  You know  Talking and doing  Retakes  And figuring out  What's good  But it's just me  In my apartment  Like a psychopath  It's nuts  You should do it  With Roland  Have Roland come over  He could be the new  Siskel and Ebert  He could be my Ebert  Yeah  I like you said  That was never up for debate 
[03:26:00]  Anthony  Good morning  I was calling to see  If I can get one of those  Cool old school  O&A shirts  I don't know  I've been  Having people ask me  About that  There's a whole bunch  In the office  Can you send them one  Eric  I guess  I didn't know what  I was going to do  With them yet  I have a bunch of stuff  That I saved  All right  Just save them for now  Because then everybody's  Going to call and ask  Yeah I've been getting it  On Twitter too  We're not doing it  Like a giveaway  We'll figure out a way  To give them away  Yeah  Well what about a 
[03:26:30]  Sam and Dave shirt  Can you send them  One of those  I think there's tons  Of those  Son of a bitch  I'll take it  All right  We'll send you  Something Anthony  Who's screening  The phone calls  There's no information  On here  The phone  The computer  With the phone  Screening server  Is shut down on us  They're working on it  Right now  Just because I'm so popular  917  What's up Sam  This is Mike Francesca  But of course  On the after show  I'm not Mike Francesca  I like that I get  To strip back the curtain  That's right man  I've been wanting  To call about Troy  Ever since this whole  Shit kind of kicked off  I was listening to it 
[03:27:00]  Like as it was happening  Yeah  And I mean I felt like  I was more interested  In them really getting  Hot at each other  You know like  It seemed real  And you know  But I think  I have to say  Out of everybody  On the show  I think Troy's the least  Like anti-gay dude there  You know what I mean  Well that's just  Troy's the most  Often confused  With gay  With being gay  Because he's down  For whatever  When you guys did  The gay off  And like  You know he's like  I don't know man 
[03:27:30]  I just feel like  Well that's what's  Really a shame  About the whole thing  It's just like  You know  In the context  Of everything  Troy is not  A homophobic guy  He's not a guy  He doesn't  He doesn't pick  Fights with people  You know what I mean  He's not an  He's not an  Overly aggressive  Violent dude  None of that stuff  Is him  He just  In this moment  Kind of things  Got heightened  For the air  And now  Now he's  At the moment  Fucked  I don't know  We'll see what happens  Yeah I mean  I was like  You know  I was listening to  Ron and Fez  Right after that  And like  And I'm just 
[03:28:00]  Kind of like  Saying to myself  Like Fez  Like  I don't want to  Blame it on Fez  But I kind of  Felt like  I don't know  I feel like  It's real hypocritical  Like Ron and Fez  And ONA  They've been together  For a long time  And like  They've seen  A lot of crazy shit  A lot of  Yeah it was  It was not good  It was not good  That he did that  At first  I definitely  Disagreed with him  Doing that at first  But he has  He's cooled out  In a big big way  And I think  Once he saw  That it was getting  Serious for Troy  He went behind the scenes  And I think  He did the right thing  Yeah I just 
[03:28:30]  I hope you guys  Don't lose Troy  He's a good dude  Man I'll tell you  That it's him  Yeah he's great  He's a great worker too  So I mean  It'd be a  It'd be a shame  For the company too  To lose  He's easy  Creative people  Are not something  That you can just  Plug and play  When you get a  Creative person  You gotta hold on to them  Because that's kind of  An individual thing  You can't teach creativity  You can plug whoever you want  Into a seat  But if they're not  A creative person  Or they don't think  In the same way  Or they're creatively different 
[03:29:00]  It's a  It's a whole different environment  And Troy is  He's one of the  He's one of the  Creative people  That are here  You know  I mean  That's something  That should be valued  I think  And it's really  Not always  Kelly  In Illinois  Hey Sammy  I was wanting to ask you  If you're  What time are you going to be  At the gathering  Friday  Well  The gathering of the  Juggalos is this weekend  And I'm planning  On being there sometime  On Friday afternoon  But with all this stuff 
[03:29:30]  Going on  I don't have a fucking clue  What's happening anymore  Well I was planning on coming  And I was also wondering  If you and Jim  Would be available  For autographs anytime  Or pictures or what not  It'll be about  $38 per signature  But I'd be willing to do it  $38  $38  It's worth $100  You're $58  Alright  I'll talk to you later  Kelly  Alright  Do you like scary movies  At all you rock  Do you like scary movies  We've talked about this before  I do  I like them 
[03:30:00]  I don't like horror movies  In the sense of like  Slasher films  So you like this  You like suspense  Yeah the shit that scares  The hell out of you  That all  I'm still thinking about  That Conjuring movie  Because it's about  A haunted house  This morning  I swear to god  I woke up  I woke up like a few minutes  Before my alarm went off  So it was about  3.30  My alarm goes off  At like 5 to 4 usually  So it's 3.30  And I look over at my clock  And then hands clap at you  No  No  But  My air conditioner  In my bedroom 
[03:30:30]  Started making these weird  Kind of  Crickety sounds  Like the plastic  Was creaking a little bit  On the shell of it  And I started thinking  Oh boy  But then I  But then I'm like  Wait wait wait  I don't think you can be haunted  And you know how  When you just wake up  You're kind of in that  Half dream state  Where you're justifying  Very odd things to yourself  I'm thinking to myself  Wait  No  I don't think you can be haunted  Right before you wake up  Like if I get up  And get out of bed now  And it's time to go to work  Like if I decide 
[03:31:00]  Okay I'm getting up  Early this morning  Then I can't be haunted  Haunting can only happen  It can wake you up  From your sleep  But not wake you up  For the day  And that kind of  Made me feel better  But I don't think  That that's a real science  But it wouldn't have been  In my head at all  Had it not been  For that Conjuring movie  I think it's just  Bullshitting yourself  Is that all  Like whatever  Just do something  Just do something  Yeah  Oh this is  This is good  Nate in Maine  Hey Sammy  Hey I was just wondering  What your thoughts were  On this Rob Zombie story 
[03:31:30]  Of him trying to shut down  The skate park  In his city  Dude  My guys  Are getting shit upon  All over the news  And I don't know  So the story  That Nate's talking about  Rob Zombie lives  In this town  In Connecticut  And I would assume  That it's a fairly  Upper echelon  Upscale  You know  Economically  Doing okay town  And they opened  A skate park  Right by his house  And Rob Zombie's wife  Went to a town hall meeting 
[03:32:00]  And asked that the skate park  Be closed  At certain times  Because he doesn't want  The loud noise  He said  Rob Zombie thinks  The skate park  And those damn kids  Skating all over his lawn  Are a little too much  For him  I know that Rob Zombie's  Like this metal guy  And everything  And he's  But he's in great shape  Right  He must do yoga  And stuff  You gotta have  Some kind of quiet time  Maybe I'm a little  Biased towards him  But then  You have this Rob Zombie  Story breaking 
[03:32:30]  And at the same time  Yesterday  Jack White's been  All over the news  And that's my other dude  Jack White's all over  The news  Because his ex-wife  Filed a restraining order  Against him  And TMZ  Posted this story  Where they say  They got a private email  From Jack White  Not like Jack White  Sent them the email  But they obtained  An email  That was privately sent  By Jack White  Which already  It's like  Let the guy send an email  You know 
[03:33:00]  Like why can't  Do you gotta hack into  Jack White's email  And even if his ex-wife  Is sending it along  Like does that  Is that really a source  Like oh look  He sent me this email  And I printed it out  You should publish  The information that's in it  Jack White sent this email  And I guess the big fight  Is that  He doesn't want  His  Kid  Jack White doesn't want  His kid  Going to the same school  As the lead singer  From the Black Keys  Because he doesn't want  To be grouped in  With the Black Keys  He says 
[03:33:30]  That the  The lead singer  Of the Black Keys  Has been grouped in  With him for too long  That he's been  And he made some reference  To the dude  From the Black Keys  Ripping him off  And that he doesn't  He just doesn't want  Any part of it anymore  He said  I'll be linked to that dude  For the next 12 years  If we send our kid  To that school  No way  I don't want him in my life  He keeps following me around  And biting off my shit  Now I mean  Jack White is obviously  Influenced by other artists  You know  It's not like everything  He's had  Has been an original thought  He's heavily influenced 
[03:34:00]  By a lot of blues artists  But I get that  I get it  If you're  There's not that many  Rock bands left  Alright  And the White Stripes  They started  A whole  Thing of music  A whole sub-genre  Really  They  White Stripes  And the Strokes  Kind of made  Garage rock  This thing  In the early 2000s  I mean  They didn't invent  Garage rock  But you know  What I'm saying  In the early 2000s  And so now  You have these bands  That kind of come along  And they sound like 
[03:34:30]  The White Stripes  And they sound like  Jack White  And he doesn't want  Anything to do with them  But he definitely  Doesn't want people  Knowing  That he doesn't want  Anything to do with them  There's nothing worse  Than  Not only having that jealousy  But people finding out about it  If you have jealousy  Over the people you're  Competitive with  You don't want  Everybody finding out  About it  Because it makes you  Sound weak  Now  I don't know  If it makes you  Sound weaker  Than being a  Heavy metal icon 
[03:35:00]  Wanting a skate park  Closed  But now  Rob Zombie  And this is why  I'm feeling  For these guys today  Because Rob Zombie  And Jack White  Both have to deal  With all this shit  Jack White's over here  All he did was  Send an email  And now everybody  Knows his business  And they're saying  Things like  Oh he didn't rip you off  You ripped off  So and so  So why shouldn't he  Bah bah bah  And Jack White  Like look  I just  Don't want to be  Associated with this dude  I don't want my kid 
[03:35:30]  Near his kid  You've heard  Obi tell the stories  When you're a parent  And your kids  Become friends  With other kids  You now have to  Hang out with the parent  Right?  So imagine  If you're in a  Creative field  If you're an artist  Of some sort  But you're a  Commercial artist  You're making  You're doing this  To make money  Because at the end  Of the day  As much of an artist  As Jack White is  He's trying to sell  Concert tickets  Right?  He was trying to sell  Records at some point  But then people  Stopped buying them 
[03:36:00]  So now he's trying  To sell concert tickets  Right?  So this dude  That you're competitive  With  Because you think  He's biting off you  Now  His kid and your kid  Are friends  So what?  You all got to  Meet at the park?  Now you got to  Hang out with this dude  Who you hate?  No!  Jack White's right!  Get him out of that class!  And Rob Zombie's  Got to take all this shit  Because I guess  Heavy metal gods  Aren't supposed to  Sleep at night  Rob Zombie is  48 years old  Okay?  I understand he's got 
[03:36:30]  A certain stage persona  But he is 48 years old  And he is still  Moving around that stage  Like David Lee Roth  Okay?  And I don't know  If it's  Veganism  Or DDP yoga  Or  Or just  Clean and healthy living  But Rob Zombie  Is doing something  That is keeping him young  And if these  God damn kids  Keep skateboarding  Up and down  His sidewalks  Yeah  Shut him down  I mean it was  A little over the top  Because  They  What they did  For him  Was they changed  The hours of the 
[03:37:00]  Skate park  That was open  So  It's no longer  Open at night  Which  You know what?  What are those kids  Doing skateboarding  At night anyway?  You skateboard in the afternoon  At night  Is when things get shady  But then he also had them  Close the skate park  On Sundays  Which is like  I mean  Is he religious?  I don't know  Maybe  Maybe he's religious  How about this?  Don't skate for the Sabbath  Maybe he's religious  And that's his day of rest  But he can't have everybody  Knowing he's religious  Because he's Rob  Fucking satanic zombie 
[03:37:30]  And that would kind of  Hurt his credibility  Does Satan sleep on Sunday?  Yeah  Maybe Satan needs  A day of rest too  This whole thing  Is hurting his credibility though  Because you don't hear like  I guess metal guys  Are not supposed to  Have some peace and quiet  Every now and then  It's not always a show  Sometimes a person  Has got to be a person  Even if their last name  Is zombie  Dylan in Maine  Hey Sam Roberts  What's up buddy?  Holy fuck  I'm talking to you for real  This is cool man  I was just thinking that 
[03:38:00]  Right on  I normally work up in the woods  And I don't have cell phone service  First time calling the show  I've been listening for a little while  Thanks man  But uh  I've been skateboarding  Since I was a young kid  And it's uh  It's wild as fuck  If it's like  A cement skate park  You know what I mean?  Yeah and so it's like  I'm assuming  It's those kind of  Domed out things  That almost look like  A hollow swimming pool  So all the sounds  Just echoing  Rob Zombie is in there  He's trying to create  His next work of genius  He's trying to have sex  With his wife  He's trying to 
[03:38:30]  Go to sleep  And all these  God damn kids  Keep skateboarding  Yeah  Wheels squealing  Trucks on metal  I mean  And every time  Somebody lands something  Everybody's freaking out  Bashing their skateboards  Against stuff  Exactly  I understand  As a skater  Like skaters  Are pushing the rules  We gotta just  You know  Conform a little bit  To reasonable rules  And everything  Everybody get along  And it's not like  It's somebody lame  Who's asking you  To quiet down  It's like okay  You know  A bunch of skaters  Should realize  Okay Rob Zombie 
[03:39:00]  Needs a little  Rob Zombie time  We can give it to him  Right  Like what's in your headphones  Probably Rob Zombie  At some point  Right  Right  Alright  Thanks buddy  Yeah I was just gonna say  It's not like  You're just hearing skating  They're gonna have music  Playing too  So they're probably  Skating to like  Super Bisto  And he doesn't want to hear it  Like Rob Zombie  Sitting there going  Like oh my god  I wrote Dragula  How many years ago  Take it off repeat  I don't need that  Screaming through my windows  Right now  Along with the sounds  Of trucks  And wheels  And cement 
[03:39:30]  Deep white zombie cuts  It's Sunday  Okay  He's trying to  Ohm out  He's trying to do  His DDP yoga  He's trying to  Deepak Chopra it up  I'm telling you  Have you seen the shape  That guy's in  It's not all  Satanism and Doritos  Okay  Do you do DDP yoga  I'm sure he does  It's all high five  Everybody does DDP yoga  I'm sure he does  But it's not  He's not just sitting there  Worshipping the devil  And eating candy  Okay  This is a guy  Who takes care of himself  He's a man of a certain age 
[03:40:00]  At this point  And you know  He's gotta do  What he's gotta do  Everybody's giving him  A hard time  I feel bad for him  Hey man  Jack White  Nicole  There's a dog  In your bag  I know  Nicole from the morning mashup  Just walked in  I've been missing you Sam  I've been missing you too  It's a lot actually  Really how much  Yeah like I was thinking about you last night  What were you doing  When I was falling asleep  Really  Yeah  Did it help you fall asleep  Or did you like  Yes it did  Yeah  Thank you Sam  What kind of dreams did you have  Sexual in nature 
[03:40:30]  No  No  A little bit  I mean maybe for a second  Okay I thought so  Did it scare you like the conjuring  Yeah yeah  What did he say  He said did it scare you like the conjuring  Was it me and my giant hair  Jumping off your bookshelf onto you  I was laughing so hard  When I watched your video  Oh thank you  I mean you're very funny  Thank you very much  Facebook by the way  Oh great  The fucking Opie and Anthony  Facebook page memories  He's getting hits  I guess so  Yeah I guess hits are hits right  He's getting numbers  I will never see the movie  Thanks to you  Because it sounds too terrifying  I'll definitely be  And I have to sleep alone tonight 
[03:41:00]  So I'm not going to be able to  Pee in the middle of the night  Without being scared  I can't do it  When you sleep alone  Are you still going to be  Thinking about me  Probably  That's so fucking cool  I love that  I love that  I love your hair  In your video too  Seems extra long  And fluffy  Does it  Yeah what's going on there  How many times did you watch it  Just once  A couple times  No  It's a short video  It was once  But I was like  Sam's hair is a little different today  It's up at youtube.com  Slash not Sam  Justin in New Jersey  Hey Sam 
[03:41:30]  What's up buddy  So like Rob Zombie  Is like a  Subpar musician at best  He's a fucking  He's a creator  Okay  He's a  And a shitty  Shitty movie director  He's not a shitty movie director  Yeah dude  Come on  And then  This is just confirming  Okay listen  House of a Thousand Corpses  Is a great movie  Devil's Rejects  Is a great movie  The second one  Was terrible  Incorrect  Completely incorrect  That's an opinion  And it's not  It's wrong  Did he do the  Zombie stripper movie too  Or no  No  He did not do that movie 
[03:42:00]  He did the Halloween remake  And that was badass  Halloween 2  I don't know about  But Lords of Salem  Was badass too  I mean get this  He doesn't know  What the fuck  Did he just hang up on him  Yeah he doesn't know  What he's talking about  You don't agree with him  So he gets hung up on  He's wrong  Okay  And he's starting trouble  Did you hear about this story  You know Rob Zombie is  Yes  He uh  There's a skate park  In his hometown  In Connecticut  Okay  And it's right by his house  And they had him  He had them  Uh  Shut it earlier  And on Sundays  Because he doesn't like 
[03:42:30]  All the noise  What  He's allowed to do that  Is it in a public place  Yeah but he's Rob  Fucking Zombie  Yeah but I mean  You're not like Brad Pitt  Yeah I know  He's way cooler than Brad Pitt  I feel like Brad Pitt  Could do that  But not Rob Zombie  Why couldn't Rob Zombie do that  Like what does Connecticut  Have going on for it  That's so great  I don't know  I just feel like that's wrong  Actually it's wrong  For any celebrity really  To do it  You know who Connecticut has  Rob Zombie and Vince McMahon  And if either of those two  Want to shut down a skate park  Let them  They should be allowed to  According to Sam Roberts  Let them  What happens if Rob Zombie 
[03:43:00]  Takes his Rob Zombie money  Someplace else  Connecticut collapses  Except for Vince McMahon  I don't know how the whole state  Is going to collapse  A lot of it will  A good chunk of it will  Because I've seen some parts  Of Connecticut  That are not great  Okay  What like Bridgeport  And I got married in  Hartford  Yeah Hartford  I got married in Middletown  Connecticut  Yes you did  There's nothing going on up there  Is there  It was really lovely  It was lovely  But there's one hotel  That's true  The whole town  I forgot  You were there Eric  Yeah  If we were  We as a group 
[03:43:30]  The Roberts group  Right  The Roberts wedding group  Right  Was keeping that town  In business that weekend  If that wedding  Had it been booked  That town would have collapsed  But that's the beauty  Of Connecticut  What is  Just to have those little  Areas that are  Very uninhabited  So that made your wedding  That much more beautiful  No believe me  If they had the opportunity  They'd have other things  Going on  They don't  I don't know  But they don't  And that's the beauty  Of Connecticut  That's where you moved  To Connecticut right  Right  So god damn it  Kids stop  Skating outside my house  I'm trying to enjoy Connecticut 
[03:44:00]  Okay alright  And I was telling Eric  He's Rob Zombie right  So everybody's going  Oh he's this metal god  He's supposed to love  Like loud  He's 48 years old  Is he really?  And he's in great shape  Does he have gray hairs yet?  I think he does a little  Hair dyeing  He does a little coloring  Just for men  But he's obviously  Keeping himself in great shape  He needs some quiet time  It's not all just  Thrash metal  He doesn't have kids  But he is married  Interesting  It would be really great  To have a bunch of  Little zombies right?  I would love that  I'm sure you would  I would love it  I wish there was  Another generation of 
[03:44:30]  Zombies coming  Little freaks  And then at the same time  As Rob Zombie's  Catching all this shit  Jack White  Is catching shit too  Did you read about that?  You know I sent you the link  Over like the weekend  I texted you  You didn't write me back  You must not have gotten it  That he got the  With the restraining order  What's going on?  Well he got the restraining order  So juicy  And then later  Is that what it is?  Juicy?  So juicy  I don't think Jack White  That wants anything  To do with juiciness  Well too bad  Too late  Got me going  I couldn't believe it  You're all juiced up already  I was like what? 
[03:45:00]  Do you have juicy  On your ass pants?  Yeah  What's ass pants?  The ass of your pants  Eric gets nervous  Around girls  On your ass pants  Ass pants  I can't believe it's  Do you believe the story?  Do you think she's just  Making it up  To make him look bad?  Well apparently  There's an email  That he didn't want  His kid going to  The same school  As the kid  Of the lead singer  Of the Black Keys  Why?  Because he doesn't like  The lead singer  Of the Black Keys  Because he copies him  Oh my god  But you know what?  You're going to find this out  One day you'll have kids 
[03:45:30]  Hopefully  In the very far away future  Why in the very far away future?  I don't think you're ready for it  Okay alright  But  You're going to realize  That when you have a kid  And that kid makes a friend  Right  You've got to be  Right  Friends with the parent  Right  So what's a DJ around here  Or a radio show host  That you're very competitive with  That you don't like him?  Oh that I don't like?  I don't have anybody  That I don't like  Tell me  Who don't you like?  I love everybody  Cavino and Rich  Is it Cavino?  You don't like Cavino  Because he kind of 
[03:46:00]  Takes Rich away from you  Yeah we've always had  Rich always says  I feel like I'm stuck  I feel like I've got  Like two divorced parents  Like you guys always  Yell at me about Cavino  And Cavino always yells at me  About you guys  So imagine if your kid's  Going to the same school  As Cavino's kid  And now all of a sudden  You've got to have family outings  With fucking Cavino  You I mean you're really  Really reading very much  Into this  I'm just saying  I wouldn't want to  You wouldn't want to  Go to family outings  With Cavino  Make new friends?  No my Cavino  Oh okay I see  The person that is  Okay I got it  Who is that for you?  E-Rock  Oh  I'm fiercely competitive 
[03:46:30]  With E-Rock  And I'm staying on top  Of you motherfucker  So you're saying  When you have kids  And when E-Rock has kids  You're not going to want them  To go to the same school together  No way  Come on  No way  You don't want to have to  Be social with him  On the weekends?  That's right  You don't want to go  To the same pool party?  Exactly  Okay  He's going to be like  My kid's going to come home  And be like  Oh  Sex Bagel Junior  Said we could come over  His house  You are not  Going to that house  Oh wow  The sex dome  You might be hurting  His feelings a little bit  Right now  I like how you're saying this  But meanwhile  You've been complaining 
[03:47:00]  That I haven't invited you  Over for a party  Well maybe that's where  Some of the resentment  Comes from  Okay  It's all coming to fruition here  Joe in New Jersey  Hey how are you?  Good  I've actually been  To Rob Zombie's house  My wife  Her best friend  Is Rob Zombie's  Brother-in-law  What?  Yeah  Six degrees of separation  I know  And the skate park  He didn't request  The skate park  To be closed down  And it was his wife  Yeah but I mean  Your wife's got  He can't go out there  And be like 
[03:47:30]  Guys that was my wife  Blame it on her  No no no no  That's the worst thing  The skate park's like  A half mile from their house  And it's on like  A narrow road  It's a half mile away?  Yeah  That seems like  A little bit of a distance  Like that  That seems like  The sound wouldn't  Travel out far  But I just remembered  What it sounds like  Outside of the development  It's like  Where their development  Comes in  And the kids skate park  On the narrow road  So coming in  The development  So he's saying  Get these damn kids  Off my lawn  Off the road  Like a crazy old man  Get these damn kids 
[03:48:00]  Off my lawn  Well his last name is Zombie  He's got to have  A little crazy in him  You wouldn't want  You wouldn't want  He's Jewish by the way  Part of the tribe  Rob Zombie is Jewish?  Yeah  Zombie doesn't sound  Like a Jewish name  Well that's his real name  Zombie Steen  Zombie  Oh I didn't realize  It was originally  Zombie scene  Thank you Joe  You wouldn't want  The skate park closed down?  No I'm  Now that I'm thinking  About it  I'm remembering  How annoying  When I have  Driven by  Or walked by  A skate park  How annoying  The sound of  The skateboard  Going up and down 
[03:48:30]  Can be  Right  It would start  To drive you crazy  Like construction  Exactly  He's an artiste  He needs his time  If it's too loud  You're too old  Alright  If it's too loud  You're too old  My ass pants are so juicy  Right now  I heard E-Rock's voice again  Yeah  If it's too loud  You're too old  Has never been  The E-Rock philosophy  Nope  You sit at home  And eat ice cream  I chase kids off my lawn  Yeah  Get out of here kids  But we heard  There was ice cream  In cartoons  Those are for me  The ice cream truck  Only visits me  Yeah 
[03:49:00]  You're just  Kicking kids out of the way  Oh no  He always buys  All the ice cream  How much for the truck  That's my bomb pop  Yeah  I feel like  Ice cream men  Are super creepy  Of course they  They're selling drugs  Something  Not always  I just feel like  Any guy that wants  To be an ice cream  Truck driver  He's creepy  Drugs and fireworks  A lot of them  Sell drugs  And fireworks  I think anything  That's a profession  I mean I guess  Teachers would apply  To that too  No except for teachers  Maybe a little teachers  Where you get  Kids attention 
[03:49:30]  Attention with music  And candy  Or ice cream  That's what it is  You know what it is  You know why  Ice cream truck drivers  Are creepy  Why  Because they drive around  In vans full of treats  And play fun music  And try to get kids  To come to their truck  Yeah to lure kids  Away from their parents  Talk about annoying  How annoying would it be  To be the driver  Listening to that same music  On loop  Over and over  The only difference  Between a kidnapper  And an ice cream truck driver  Is that the ice cream truck drivers  Don't invite the kids  Into the truck  Hey maybe some do  That makes them kidnappers 
[03:50:00]  And that's wrong  That's 100%  That's my stance on it  I think it's everybody's stance on it  You know  We were talking about you  Being juiced up  But I don't know  If you've ever been  In the situation  Where you get all  Lathered up  And you're ready to shave  Yes  You know what I mean  Yeah  You gotta get that beard down  Yeah  And you realize  You forgot to buy blades  Now you're stuck  Nicole  And you're digging  Through the trash  For that old blade  That nicked up your face  Yesterday  You're one step away  From stealing your wife's  Lady razor

Totally on the upswing  Because sometimes they're not  Yeah sometimes we fight  Yeah  Pretty bad  But right now things are good?  Couldn't love them more  How long have they been good for?  A long time  Really?  Most of 2013  Whoa no  Because I've talked to you in 2013  And things have been very very bad  So when was your last fight?  A few  Last night  Last night  He was trying to get a splinter  Out of my toe  And I screamed at him  That he was doing it wrong  Why would you do that?  It hurt so bad  He was hurting me  He was putting hydrogen peroxide on 
[03:52:30]  And it was bubbling and burning  Yeah but you know what would happen  If my wife came to me  And said there's a splinter in my toe  What?  Get it out  No I don't know how  You should probably take care of it  Shut up  That's not a very good husband  Well you're not a very good wife  This is what  I mean  You should not be sitting there  If he's going  And doing this gentlemanly thing  Of taking the thing  Out of your toe  Right  Who are you to be like  He was hurting me  It was hurting  It's not like he was using scissors  He was using tweezers  That's what you're supposed to use  My dad used to use a safety pin  My dad never hurt me 
[03:53:00]  When he took out a splinter  But Matt was killing me last night  Did you say that to him?  Yeah and he  What a shitty thing to say  He didn't like that  You're not my dad  He was like  Why don't you get your dad to do it then  Exactly  He wasn't thrilled about that  Exactly  Why don't you marry your dad then  Talk about creepy  How's your dad doing?  You want to hear the creepiest  That reminded me  It's still to this day  It creeps out Jess  And I almost regret doing it  Because she doesn't believe  That I was joking  Okay  At Christmas  My mom always gets the same perfume  She does  For every Christmas  Every birthday  From the time we were kids 
[03:53:30]  But she smells lovely  It was wonderful  One Christmas  Where everybody's opening their gifts  And she goes  Oh I never would have thought  And you know making a joke  Because obviously  She's going to get the perfume  And I was explaining to Jess  I was like yeah  My mom always gets this  She's worn the same perfume  Ever since I was a baby  And Jess goes oh  And I go yeah  You should really try some  No see  You don't want your wife  To smell like your mother  No I was joking  But you scared her for a second 
[03:54:00]  No for the rest of our relationship  Because she doesn't believe  That I was kidding  But I was  I don't want her smelling  Like my mother  I miss Jess  So what  But other than the splinter  Other than that  Yeah we've been really good  Sorry  But maybe we've been  Getting along really well  The past few months  Maybe the past like  Few hours  Since the splinter  Yeah since the splinter incident  Last night before we went to sleep  Getting sex on the regular  Totally  Good  Yeah he tried to go  One more time before he left  This morning  But  Where is he  He's going to Boston  To meet some clients  Oh my gosh  Business
