<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts fuming about being forced back to work from vacation by their radio station management,  complaining about the meticulous tracking of their vacation days. Anthony recounts a near-drowning incident in his pool while intoxicated, resulting in facial injuries severe enough to warrant a photograph.  He then launches into a detailed, profanity-laced account of shooting guns with Daniel Craig at his compound.  They describe the weapons used, including a .50 caliber, the shooting experience, and their subsequent socializing, with Anthony portraying Craig as a fun, Guinness-loving shooting enthusiast. Opie playfully mocks Anthony for downplaying the event.  The conversation then shifts to the Casey Anthony verdict.  Opie boasts about correctly predicting the "not guilty" verdict, and the hosts dissect the trial, expressing disbelief at the lack of evidence for a conviction, despite believing Anthony's guilt.  They critique the prosecution, speculate on the sentencing, and discuss public outrage and media reactions. A Jay Leno joke about the verdict is played before the next segment.

Next, UFC fighter Uriah Faber is interviewed.  He discusses his controversial loss to Dominic Cruz, detailing his injuries (a hairline fracture and hand problems), his dislike for Cruz, and his frustrations with inexperienced MMA judges. He talks about the physical toll of fighting, specifically leg kicks, and shares past injuries. The conversation lightens with discussions of Faber's dating life, his aversion to beaches, and a humorous Bali bar fight anecdote (available on YouTube).  The segment promotes the UFC Personal Trainer video game, featuring listener calls requesting copies.  Faber even demonstrates a joint lock on one of the hosts. The interview concludes announcing the upcoming guests: Dennis Leary and Adam Ferrara, with a brief "Rescue Me" theme song interlude.

The show then transitions into a segment focusing on the hosts' potential departure after 17 years,  Jim Norton's possible TV career, sports fandom (Boston Bruins and New York Islanders), and numerous anecdotes.  Key moments include discussion of Norton’s potential half-hour TV show, a graphic story about a superstitious "Dick-out Rule" involving Colin Quinn, the Celtics, and Bill Laimbeer,  details about Adam Ferrara’s engagement and his fiancée's reaction to his comedy, extensive discussion of *Rescue Me*'s finale, several Rolling Stones anecdotes (including a bathroom encounter with Keith Richards and Ron Wood), stories about Adam Ferrara's driving habits, and Dennis Leary's emotional explanation for his firefighter advocacy stemming from a family tragedy.

Dennis Leary enters the studio.  He discusses his career transition from stand-up to acting (including *Rescue Me*, *Spider-Man*, and *Ice Age*), his preference for cable's creative freedom, and the challenges of adapting comedy to television. The conversation jumps to Leary's chess experience, encounters with celebrities (including Derek Jeter, Robert De Niro, and Buzz Aldrin), graphic and offensive comments on Casey Anthony, a pool injury, and his own shooting session with Daniel Craig. The segment concludes with a brief appearance by Dana White, discussing a recent UFC event and Tito Ortiz's performance.  The segment is rife with profanity and crude humor.

The final segment features Dana White.  He introduces his large Hawaiian bodyguard, explaining his need for security due to overwhelming fan interactions.  He shares anecdotes about his bodyguard and various celebrities, including positive stories about Rihanna and Justin Bieber, but a negative encounter with Justin Timberlake (referred to as a "douchebag").  He expresses intense anger towards the New York Athletic Commission, Sheldon Silver, and the Culinary Union for blocking MMA legalization in New York, despite UFC's success in Toronto.  He discusses recent UFC fights, praising Jose Aldo and Anderson Silva,  and addresses the challenges of fighters competing against friends.  He details his schedule, including filming "The Ultimate Fighter" (with a two-hour premiere featuring Bisping and Miller), and mentions the controversial previous season winner, Tony.  He shares his reaction to Whitey Bulger's arrest and promotes the upcoming UFC fight in Philadelphia (August 6th), featuring Davis vs. Evans and Rich Franklin vs. Little Nog, highlighting a particularly vicious knockout he witnessed. The interview ends with White reiterating his frustration with New York's decision and encouraging attendance at the Philadelphia event.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Right away, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Why the fuck are we here?  Yeah, right?  We should have just taken the whole week.  No, why?  I'll tell you why we're here.  We're fishing already.  And our mics sound different.  And our mics sound different.  And our mics sound different.  Oh, do they?  Oh, absolutely.  I don't know what they did.  I think they just, they tinker with stuff when we're not here.  Is there tinkering going on?  Because they're bored or something?  It does have a bassier tone to it.  Mars, it sounds like shit.  It's got a bassier tone to it.  It's got a bassier tone to it. 
[00:05:00]  Whatever the settings were five days ago, let's just do that.  Oh, that's impossible to get back to.  I think they have to tinker and fiddle when we're not here.  Fiddling, tinkering.  They fiddle about.  A lot of people are like, why are you guys doing two days of radio?  I'll tell you why.  Because they pay way too close attention down the hall.  Yeah.  They got a vacation list and they just have check marks.  Yeah, little circles and X's and check marks.  Because at the end of last year's contract year, they actually told me I wasn't allowed 
[00:05:30]  to take a day off.  Isn't that great?  Pieces of shit.  So that's why we're here.  The old days, we took our days and we never even counted them.  But these bean counters, they're counting our vacation days.  Every day.  So we figure we could take a couple days here and then use these two days later in the  summer.  We try to throw them.  Huh?  We try to throw them off.  Oh, I know.  But they're keeping track.  Of course they are.  They know to the minute how much time we got left.  Yeah.  As far as vacation days. 
[00:06:00]  Thanks.  What the hell, we're here and we'll have a good time for the next two days.  Yes.  How's everybody doing?  Goody good.  It was nice having a little bit of time off.  Yes.  That was nice.  Did you almost kill yourself?  Oh, God.  I'm a mess.  You look pretty fucked up.  I pulled a Danny.  Pulled a Danny Ross there.  You blew someone and almost drank yourself to death?  Of record time.  That's great. 
[00:06:30]  Drinking and engage over the same one.  No, it was the pool, obviously.  I took a dive into the pool and I didn't hit on the bottom of the pool, but I was coming  back up and I think I went a little too far.  Not I think.  I did go a little too far.  Just scraped on the side of the pool?  I just scraped up the side of the pool on my forehead right up there.  Oh, yeah.  And then my schnazola and God damn, fucking, looks like I was beat up. 
[00:07:00]  You were very, I went over that night and Ant was very, very tipsy.  Oh, yeah.  Was that fun?  Oh, was I?  Was that fun to check out?  I got there late, but it was, at one point we were in the pool and I was getting out  and he was asleep in the pool with his head on a step and his feet on like one of those  floaty mattresses.  Yeah.  I'm like, how is he asleep like that?  And you kept turning to the left and your mouth and nose would brush the water and then 
[00:07:30]  you'd come back up.  Oh, my God.  But I was like, I was getting out of the pool.  You do have a will, right?  Of course.  For your family.  I was watching him like he was a child.  I hate to see the steak and everything.  That was good.  But, yeah, I think if my head would have been underwater, I might have woken up.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe, but people think they'd wake up when they're puking and choking on it, too.  Yeah, man, they don't.  I wasn't, me and the mortgage weren't willing to take that chance.  It was a tipsy night.  Oh, that was a tipsy, tipsy night.  I was like, bro, you got to get out of the pool because I was getting out. 
[00:08:00]  I was like, I can't leave him in there by himself.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  You're like, I'm all right.  I'm like, you're not.  And you're like, yeah, maybe I'm not.  Maybe I should go to bed.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So I went, yeah, but oh, man, I really skinned the shit out of my face.  Yeah, it looks pretty bad.  My face there.  Looks pretty bad.  That nose can't take a good beating.  He was bleeding.  I wanted to rush you to Parkland Memorial.  Holy shit.  Had a nice head wound.  Oh, my God.  What a shot to the face. 
[00:08:30]  I grabbed a picture of it.  I should pop it up there somewhere.  Yeah, yeah.  It took quite the...  There it is.  That's...  No, I saw it on Twitter.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I follow you on Twitter.  Yeah.  With the...  Paper towel full of blood.  Yeah, very bloody.  I thought it was a towel, but paper towels.  Yeah.  To clean up the blood.  Yeah, that's right when it happened.  Damn.  Oh, that was great.  Damn.  Whew.  That was part of the Daniel Craig day.  Oh, that was the end of it. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That was...  You had a pretty good tease on Twitter, because you said you were bringing a friend to the  range.  I was thinking it was Jimmy Norton all the way, because you haven't shot yet, right?  Never.  No.  So I thought it was going to be Jimmy, and next thing you know, it's Daniel Craig.  It was James Bond there.  Daniel Craig.  How the fuck did that come about?  I don't know.  You know, you find friends.  I know you.  I know.  We have the same friends.  Yeah, of course.  I know the deal.  But how did it actually go down?  Well, he's wanted to shoot for a while, and I'm pretty much the go-to guy when it comes 
[00:09:30]  to, hey, we need a shitload of weapons.  Right.  And, yeah, we all had it.  Someone put the word out to him saying, look, I know a guy.  Yeah, we all had it out.  And you can pretty much shoot whatever you want.  Yeah.  And so then Daniel Craig said, well, that sounds like a good time.  Yeah.  Nice.  And he was definitely a fun guy, man.  What a pisser.  Yeah.  Just loves the shit out of shooting and drinking some Guinness.  Did he meet you at the range or at the compound? 
[00:10:00]  We started out at my house and then grabbed up all the weaponry, which weighed the back  of Mike's car down.  Wow.  Just hysterical.  We're just driving.  And he has an SUV, big one.  And the thing was loaded out with weaponry and ammunition.  Were you like, holy shit, this is Daniel Craig?  Uh, yeah, you know, it's kind of interesting to meet celebrities like that.  He's a good guy.  Seems, uh, he's James Bond, for the love of God, you know. 
[00:10:30]  Yes, Jimmy, go ahead.  No.  I see Jimmy's face.  I didn't see Anthony before, but I did see him after the Daniel Craig.  And when Ope just said it, were you like, oh my God, it's Daniel Craig.  If you don't go, yes, I was, every two seconds to myself saying that.  I came in that night and he goes, fucking Daniel Craig, James Bond was shooting my fucking gun.  You've got to say it.  I'm fucking toxic. 
[00:11:00]  Yes, I'm trying to be, I'm trying false modesty right now.  Oh, it's hilarious.  You're trying to be cool.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it was pretty goddamn cool, to tell you the truth.  Were you, were you having one of the, like one of my Obama dreams?  Like, don't blow this, don't blow this, don't blow this?  No, I don't think, I don't think at that point I could have.  Like, when you're sitting there going, oh, please don't say anything stupid.  This is way too cool and I want to, I don't want to blow this.  Well, I didn't want to come off like fanboy, you know. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  You don't want to do that.  Right.  Well.  Really bad.  But then you're focused on that and that's where you could fuck it up.  But there were a couple of, you know, there were a couple of instances where questions  came up like I would ask, you know, I guess if anybody was around about certain movies,  things like that.  Right.  I'm sure he wanted to talk about movies.  That's what he does.  So, you know.  When you hang backstage with the band, you don't talk about their music.  Occasionally.  I learned that a long time ago.  Something just comes up and you talk about it.  What was your movie questions? 
[00:12:00]  God damn.  Did you talk about James Bond?  Well, I'd talk about like, if you're worried about, you know, destroying the franchise.  Oh, yeah.  Because that's, because it was a reboot.  It's a Bond reboot.  It wasn't, you know, like they just brought in another guy to take up where the other  guy left off.  Sure.  So I was like, you know, you must have gotten the script and been like, oh, am I going  to be the guy that destroys the James Bond franchise?  Right.  And yeah, he did have some concerns about that shit, you know. 
[00:12:30]  But that's, I didn't really get into the whole thing.  Well, walk us through it.  So you guys go to the compound to load up and then go to the range.  We load up.  We go out to the range.  How was the conversation in the car to the range?  Yeah.  Very, very just casual.  Casual?  Relaxed about all kinds of just like small talk kind of shit.  But did he keep turning your head going, holy shit?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  No.  Come on, man.  No, I was sitting in the back seat on the way there.  Oh, really? 
[00:13:00]  I was sitting on the front seat on the way back.  Right.  Because he was taking some phone calls and stuff.  We were just looking at the back of his head going, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.  Yeah, so I was looking at the back of his head and he's going, yeah, he's got a great  head of hair on him.  What am I doing?  That's James Bond.  Holy shit.  I'm going to shoot with James Bond.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Well, yeah, that was kind of cool, you know, getting to the range and firing off some weapons.  What about the boys at the range?  Were they, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit?  Holy shit, that's James Bond.  Well, it was a very private range that day. 
[00:13:30]  Gotcha.  So, yeah.  It was all set up nice.  There was a guy there taking care of business and we pretty much had the whole range to ourselves.  So we went out there and shot off, I pretty much, I brought everything.  I brought like every weapon that I owned for the most part.  How much did it cost you?  It didn't cost me really anything.  Ammunition.  Leaving with ammo.  So, that's how things work.  The ammo, though?  Yeah.  They tossed me some ammo.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, it was nice.  Oh, nice. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, it's always nice when that happens.  Good for you.  But the .50 cal, yeah.  You can't shoot it enough to go through a lot of rounds.  I think I brought probably, I brought a case, which is probably a hundred rounds of ammo and I don't even think we went through maybe 25 rounds because it's just, it's too much.  It beats your body to shit, shooting that thing.  How many times did you shoot that?  But I took probably four or five shots off of it. 
[00:14:30]  That's all it takes to beat your body up.  And then you're just like, I can't, my head is going to fucking explode.  I don't know how these guys, that's their weapon, like in the Middle East and Afghanistan, I don't know how they shoot this fucking thing all day.  Because it's just, boom, boom.  Do they have special equipment?  You know what?  You could throw on all your shit, but I'm thinking when things go down and you just got to pull your weapon out and start shooting. 
[00:15:00]  Gotcha.  You're not ready to, you know, put ear plugs in and shit like that.  It's just, and the concussion, it doesn't matter what you put on your ears or your eye protection.  It's the sheer concussion that is going through your sinuses and everything else in your upper body, the shockwave that hits your chest and stuff.  It just, it fucks you up.  Now, I want to go back to Jimmy.  Is he downplaying the James Bond story?  Well, I didn't see, no, I didn't see him all happen.  It seems like he might be. 
[00:15:30]  When I saw him, he'd tipped a few back and it was just funny to hear him describing, fucking James, James Bond, shoot my fucking gun.  Is that shit, my God?  It's great.  It's fucking great.  And then a minute later, I'd get a cookie and I'd come back and I'd go, man, it's a good fucking James.  I'm fucking James Bond.  Jimmy's making fun of me.  Everybody's very happy.  How was the chit-chat on the range?  Good.  A lot of gun talk, you know, on that. 
[00:16:00]  Got to, um.  He's like a man's man, isn't he?  Yeah.  He's one of those man's men.  Yeah, yeah.  He's well built.  I'm looking at the picture.  I didn't realize how fucking muscular he is.  Yeah, yeah, I think he's in training for the next one.  Fuck.  The next Bond movie.  And then you were able to get him back to the compound?  Wait a minute, hold on, excuse me.  You didn't fucking steal my idea and give it to him, I hope.  Oh, what?  What, there's a bomb in the president's office?  I hope that's not the next James Bond movie.  No, no, I didn't give him that.  Okay.  I'll save you, Mr. President.  I'm making sure.  That's mine. 
[00:16:30]  No, that's best saved for a Harrison Ford vehicle, I think.  Okay, much better.  Something like that.  So, uh, yeah, the good shit was shooting, uh, the, uh, of course, the Walther PPKs.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, shooting a Walther with, uh, you know, that's the James Bond gun, for the love of God.  Uh, and then, um, some of the other weaponry around the, uh, the range was a lot of fun  to shoot.  But, um, and then, yeah, we were going back, uh, and, and dropping me off, and, uh, Mike 
[00:17:00]  was like, oh, let's grab a Guinness.  So, I went into the house, downstairs, and, and I had the, the party the night before, or  two nights before, God only knows.  Didn't you just have one long party?  It just kept going.  So, you know.  How long was the party?  The place was a wreck.  Uh, Friday, after work.  Till yesterday?  Till, yeah.  Till, like, yesterday.  Although, yesterday, I would really just, I sat around doing nothing. 
[00:17:30]  You finally crashed?  Yeah, I, I had it.  I had totally had it.  So, we came back, yeah.  Ordered up some pizzas, and, uh, grabbed some Guinness, hung out outside, and, uh, were  your neighbors like, holy shit, holy shit.  No, they couldn't see.  They couldn't see.  Where's the holy shit, holy shit?  That's James Bond.  There were those, but I wasn't gonna say them out loud.  Yeah.  You know, it's, it's, it's, yes, it's very, very cool, you know.  Yeah.  See the guy there, and he, and he's, uh, you know, very attentive to the range master. 
[00:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  Knowing, they, they did, uh, pretty well with the shooting.  We were doing drills, like walking drills and, uh, other things, hitting certain parts  of the target, not just hitting the target.  And, uh, yeah, it was, was it a good shot?  It was fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Definitely.  And, uh, you know, that, that's, that's about.  How long did he stay at the compound after the shooting?  I don't know, about an hour or so.  Nice.  Fucking.  Did you guys exchange emails? 
[00:18:30]  Let me see, uh, let me see the, uh, let me see the Shelby.  It's like, oh, okay.  So he gets in.  People, boom, starts it up.  It's like, hey, yeah, there it is.  Danny Craig's starting on my car.  Mm-hmm.  Did he say, holy shit, holy shit?  Holy shit, holy shit.  Holy shit.  He's revving my Shelby.  Look, we've been at this a long time and every once in a while you get one of these  holy shit moments.  Holy shit, holy shit.  And you're in the middle of one of these holy shit moments.  So I want to know when you said, holy shit, holy shit. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, but I tried to control myself.  I understand.  You have to.  I was trying to control myself and being just a regular guy.  How did it end?  He didn't want to come up.  Did you exchange phone numbers or anything?  Done with the pizza, done with the beers, and him and Mike were taking off.  And that was it.  It was like, take it easy.  I had a great time.  Gave the old handshake and then the old man handshake hug back pat thing.  And then off they go. 
[00:19:30]  And that was it.  And that was pretty much it.  Nice visit with Daniel Craig.  As soon as the front door closed, did he go, holy shit.  Holy shit, holy shit.  I can't believe that just happened.  You're a pisser.  Jimmy, you think he did?  Holy shit, holy shit.  I know he did.  What do you think happened as soon as that door closed after his day with Daniel Craig?  As soon as the door closed, he probably just went, fuck, James fucking Bond. 
[00:20:00]  And went and looked at him on YouTube as James Bond and went, that was the guy.  That's really him.  And he probably went over the whole conversation.  And there was one thing he said.  He was like, I wish I didn't say that.  I introduced him as Daniel Bond.  You think I critiqued my whole conversation.  You don't think it was stupid when I said that.  Trying to be cool, like just hanging out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony probably said it was a girl.  When I mentioned that we were both using the Bond gun, you don't think that was bad?  And she was like, no, it's fine. 
[00:20:30]  He said it eight times.  It was cool.  He got it.  How many pictures did you get?  Quite a few.  Okay, that's good.  Yes, pictures.  It's pretty funny, though, watching them.  Shoot the Desert Eagle .50, too.  Right.  And the Barrett .50.  You should have just hit on him the whole time.  Oh, Jesus.  When he was shooting those big guns.  Like, you should have just touched his arm.  Like, you really got out of the way.  I don't think I would do that, Jimmy.  You should have just flirted with him. 
[00:21:00]  But you hear like, boom.  Holy mother fuck.  That's awesome.  Let's go to Jason in Texas.  Jason.  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Hey.  Hey, Ant.  Were you walking around the compound with Daniel Krakis?  Da-da-da-da!  No.  No.  That was probably afterwards.  I was not doing anything.  You probably just cranked up all his whole sound system.  You guys are complete assholes.  Did you?  You should have pulled your cock at one. 
[00:21:30]  Look, that's about 07.  See, it can't just be two men of similar ilk hanging out.  No, that wasn't similar.  That was a holy shit, holy shit.  What karaoke song did you sing?  I didn't sing any karaoke songs.  Sit down, sit down, Danny.  Hey, people, Danny.  I want to sing one.  No.  I'm going to sing for your eyes only.  Shut up.  No, he wanted them to do it.  Do you want them together to sing?  You're the one that I want. 
[00:22:00]  Do you ever see Grease?  Fucking song's amazing.  You guys are the worst, man.  Spectro wants to know if you masturbated after the fact.  Shut up.  There's no need for that.  He's a good guy.  Let's go to Steve in Orlando.  He's shooting some guns.  Good morning, Steve.  Hey, just so you guys know, I saw live from the compound that night, Anthony was freaking out.  He was talking about his muscles while he was holding the gun. 
[00:22:30]  Daniel Craig revved my engine.  He revved my engine on my Shelby.  Do you understand, sir?  There was a tad bit of sarcasm in what I was doing.  I actually said his eyes were dreamier than Andy Levy's from Red Eye.  Oh, I didn't say I wouldn't have acted the same way.  I just couldn't help but notice that you were playing it down a little bit more this morning.  That's all.  Of course he is.  Oh, please.  Of course he is.  I play up things to the camera, sir. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  I just don't think I'm going to go to take a...  Tim in Jersey.  Tim.  I'm going to get slack for all this.  Tim.  Hey.  Sorry, I came from Jersey.  Hey, Anthony, did you ask Daniel if you wanted his Guinness shaken, not stirred?  No.  Did you tell him how much you liked Roger Moore?  No.  And that he was the best Bond?  No, I did not. 
[00:23:30]  You didn't do that?  There was no speaking of Roger Moore or anything else.  He's got Cowboys and Aliens coming up.  That's the next movie coming out.  That's the one he's in.  When the fuck is that movie coming out?  They promoted that during the Super Bowl, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The Super Bowl was like 10 months ago, I think.  Yeah.  What the fuck's going on?  Well, it's a big comic book-y kind of geeky movie.  Yeah, that Daniel Craig thing is pretty damn cool, though.  Yeah, you know.  That's all right. 
[00:24:00]  That's pretty good.  Yeah, it's a fun and, you know, a celebrity.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  We should move on to Casey Anthony just because we got Uriah Faber coming in at 7.  Now there's a celebrity I want to have over the compound.  Then we got the Rescue Me guys coming in.  We got a busy fucking show today.  So if we don't do Casey Anthony now, we might not do it for a while.  By the way, I got to say, I had this thing called right from the start.  Yes, you did.  Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[00:24:30]  I know exactly what was going on.  I got it right here.  Oh, wow.  This was almost a month ago you said this.  A month ago.  I kept tabs on this whole trial, my friend.  Let's call this.  Three weeks ago you said this.  I have a prediction for the fucking Casey Anthony trial right there.  Right.  She will not be convicted of first-degree murder.  This is a capital murder case, and they just don't have it.  They don't have enough evidence.  People know she's involved in some type of shenanigans with this kid being dead.  I know.  But as far as getting a first-degree murder charge, nah. 
[00:25:00]  I ain't seeing it.  There you go.  Ain't seeing it.  And they didn't even give her any of the murder charges or manslaughter or nothing.  Because as time went on, even after I said that, I realized there was nothing there.  You know what was there?  Emotion from Hausfrau's.  And, look, I'm not saying she's innocent, but she's not guilty.  Oh, you just missed it.  Damn it.  There's Daniel Craig on the TV. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, look at that.  It looks like...  Right there on the TV.  Look at that.  It's Cowboys and Aliens.  That's the movie.  Did you discuss this movie with them?  Uh, not really, no.  No, huh?  I didn't want to discuss too many movies.  Look, he's my pal.  You think girls like him?  Girls?  God, he was telling me one story about some fucking...  He got pulled over for something and, you know, he had his girl in the car and everything.  And the guy was, like, trying to pick up on him. 
[00:26:00]  What, the guy was trying to pick up on him?  Yeah, yeah.  He was like...  The cop?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's something...  Hey, Harrison Ford's in that, huh?  Harrison Ford's in this?  I didn't even know that.  I want to see this goddamn movie.  Fucking Harrison Ford doesn't really age, huh?  No, he looks very...  Like I'm saying, I'm kind of creepy.  He got older and then just stopped right there.  Right.  He reached a point.  That was it.  It was a very long ad for Cowboys and Aliens on the TV.  Yeah, what the hell?  Oh, I guess this is on the... 
[00:26:30]  Apple TV.  Apple TV.  Oh, it's Apple TV.  Oh, I didn't want to interrupt the KC...  I thought it was on the TV.  That's fine.  I didn't know that we were controlling that shit.  That's right.  It was on one of our TVs, so I thought they did a...  All right, whatever.  It is a pretty cool idea.  It's like, you know, why the hell would all the alien shit have to happen post-1940?  Sure.  You know, you picture Cowboys...  People in the Old West would freak the fuck out at Aliens.  It is a great idea. 
[00:27:00]  What the fuck is this?  Anyway, so KC Anthony...  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, obviously the jury should have found her fucking innocent.  Of course.  Yeah, not guilty.  That's a travesty, because she's guilty of fucking something.  She's guilty of something.  But right from the start, when I was watching even the opening statements of the prosecution,  they didn't have anything.  They didn't have how the kid died.  You kind of need how someone died to get a murder rap. 
[00:27:30]  Cause of death, sure.  Cause of death.  There was no timeline.  And people said, well, the Scott Peterson thing was all circumstantial evidence.  They had the body that washed up on the shore of the water that this guy, his alibi was  that he was fishing, and there was a definite time frame thing there.  There's no time frame with her.  It could have happened in this whole area, this gray area.  And there's a lot more motive with Scott Peterson. 
[00:28:00]  He wanted to get rid of his wife who was pregnant because he didn't want to be weighed down,  so he didn't move on to this other chick.  There's a motive there.  And there were no witnesses and no video of her abusing the kid in any way.  They didn't have, you know, oh, here she is smacking the kid around or yelling.  It was footage of her playing with the kid.  The prosecution just blew this, huh?  Either they blew it or there was really nothing else to go on to.  Or they just couldn't get enough fucking evidence.  Cause I thought the prosecution did a great job with what they had, 
[00:28:30]  but right from the start, I was just like, they don't have anything.  You need, the body they had was nothing.  They had bones.  They couldn't even get DNA.  They couldn't tell if it had been touched.  Animals had screwed with it.  They didn't know where this tape was from.  There were no fingerprints.  It just was not enough for a jury to say, yeah, she's guilty of murder.  Oh, really?  How'd she do it?  Bow.  Bow.  When did she do it?  I'm not really sure.  Why'd she do it? 
[00:29:00]  She likes to party?  Eh.  So when they were saying not guilty on all those charges, I wasn't surprised.  A lot of people, though, freaking out.  Oh, boy, these moms.  Ah, you fucking bitch.  I can't wait till you're dead.  You'll burn in hell.  Well, no.  Unfortunately, karma, that karma isn't a bitch.  No, it's fine.  You live long enough, you realize karma is not a bitch.  Ah, of course not.  It never works out that way. 
[00:29:30]  Serial killers that just die in their beds, sleeping at 85, 90 years old.  Karma is not a bitch.  Yeah.  That's the statement for today.  That's how it works.  So stop with that horse shit.  But, uh, boy, I'll tell you.  Bat shit crazy.  Yep.  Liar.  A little nutty, right?  Yep.  She's got them crazy eyes.  Do you want the jury reads the final verdict?  I guess that's a bit of it at this point.  That was the big moment.  Most people have heard that, right?  That was the big moment.  Right, just in case they haven't heard it. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  I liked her in her little, uh, pink, uh, little pink tuxedo shirt she was wearing.  She looked very cute and very ladylike in it.  That isn't a good picture, Sam.  Please.  Please.  Nah, she's haggard.  She'll get her shit together after she gets out of jail, right?  Once she has all the makeup to get gussied up.  See, that's a good picture right there.  She is haggard, though, boy.  A couple weeks in the gym.  She needs some sleep.  A couple weeks in the gym, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Get rid of that bloated look of hers.  Yeah, she's got the bags under her eyes, because, you know, how good could you sleep when one 
[00:30:30]  of the matronly dykes in the jail cell wants to, uh, you know, have you shove your face  down into her pussy?  Her brillo pad.  Yeah, that's, you know, that's got to keep you up at night.  Her very rough brillo pad.  Here's the verdict being read.  In the circuit court for the 9th Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida.  State of Florida versus Casey Marie Anthony.  As to case number 2008, CF-15606-0. 
[00:31:00]  As to the charge of first-degree murder, verdict as to count one, we, the jury, find the defendant  not guilty, so say we all, dated at Orlando, Orange County, Florida, on this 5th day of  July, 2011, signed for a person.  As to the charge of aggravated child abuse, verdict as to...  That's going to be boring.  Let's cut our losses.  Well, you know why?  Because...  It's not guilty.  You need the video.  Right.  You know, you got to show her.  She gets more and more like... 
[00:31:30]  And then they're all hugging.  I don't like they couldn't get her on anything.  I thought they could have got her on something.  Well, they got her on lying.  Hopefully...  And the judge could give her time served, or he could make them consecutive instead  of concurrent.  Consecutive, yeah.  So I really hope that he makes them consecutive, even if it's out of the ordinary for a case  like this.  Really?  Yes.  I hope he makes them consecutive, just a few years.  I really think they want to get this shit out of the way, to tell you the truth. 
[00:32:00]  Do you?  I'm guessing...  Probation?  No, I'm guessing a concurrent sentence, time served.  Holy shit.  Why would they do that when they could make them consecutive?  It almost seems like...  It almost seems unjust.  It's like, we couldn't get you on this.  We'll get you on this.  Good.  Yeah, but it...  She shouldn't have lied to the cops.  That is good, but it just doesn't work that way. 
[00:32:30]  It's not L.A.  You know what?  She shouldn't have lied to the cops, this fucking twat about her dead kid.  She shouldn't have lied to the police.  Yeah.  But the judge has been pretty good.  He's been pretty fair and honest with this whole thing.  He hasn't made the old media circus out of it.  Not like Judge Ito.  But I don't know.  And this, I don't know.  I don't know for sure what they're going to do, but they can apply time served to some  of her sentence, even if they do give her a four-year, which is the max, she might serve 
[00:33:00]  a couple of years of it.  How long has she been in jail?  She's been in for three years, but she's also in on a check fraud thing.  So she's already done three years?  She's done less than three years, because some of that was attributed to her check fraud.  Well, that's how they were able to keep her, right?  Yeah.  So why would she get time served, then, if some of that was check fraud?  Just some of it.  Not all of it.  The rest was just, they arrested her for murder. 
[00:33:30]  She's not going to stay in jail too much longer.  She's not going to be, put it this way, she's been in jail three years.  If they tell her she's got to serve 18 more months, she's going to be like, I can do  it on my head.  I can do it on my head.  There's no way.  It'll be less than a year.  But I think they might just want to, the prosecutor's retired.  He's like, fuck this.  I'm out of here.  Yeah.  The head prosecutor's like, just, I've had this.  I'm done.  If I couldn't win this one, I'm done.  Holy shit.  But she might, I don't know. 
[00:34:00]  I think they might just want to, look, let's get this fucking shit out of our court system.  Let her, let her go on to do whatever the fuck she, she's going to do with her life  and get her out of our system.  Now you might, Anthony's a local legal expert.  You might be right.  You've been right so far.  But wouldn't it look better if they kept her for a couple of years?  So this way she's not released in the middle of the circus.  She's released a couple of years from now.  So at least she'll say, well, she was in jail for six years.  That's true.  And if you had the type of judge that might do that, then I'd say that that could happen. 
[00:34:30]  And it still could.  But this Judge Perry is really, he's a straightforward judge guy.  Like, all right, the jury spoke.  We do have these charges.  She has been in jail.  You know, it's not my job and it's not his job to make up some kind of a sentencing based  on what he personally thinks because he's in charge of sentencing.  Right.  So it's not his job to sentence her based on any personal feelings he might have. 
[00:35:00]  But he's going to take into consideration.  Can he give a consecutive, not concurrent?  He can, legally.  He can.  So why would the law give a judge that discretion if not to be used in times like this?  Or times where the judge feels it's appropriate?  Why would the law allow him that discretion?  Because it really doesn't happen very often.  It's a misdemeanor charge.  It's not a felony charge.  It's a misdemeanor charge. 
[00:35:30]  And that's what he's got to work with, right?  It would be excessive.  Yeah.  It would be excessive even though what she was originally brought up on, but she was  acquitted of it.  And he does seem like a no-nonsense kind of, look, here's what we do.  And to serve three years, some of that time for check fraud, I mean, not many people serve  that much time for a check fraud case.  Yeah.  So there's...  Oh, man, are you kidding me?  Look, see, a lot of people aren't really agreeing with me.  What, they think she's going to stay in jail? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But I've gone through this on Twitter and everything.  When's the sentencing going to happen?  Today.  I guess they hit the court about nine o'clock.  Yeah.  Really?  So, all right, let's...  There's going to be some yipping and yapping beforehand.  All right, let's put it on the table.  How long do you think she gets?  We'll check this shit tomorrow.  I say...  Less than a year?  I'm saying no more than 18 months if she doesn't just walk out.  So I'm going...  I'm thinking it's 50-50. 
[00:36:30]  Either 18 months or she walks that day.  I think the judge will do something, but obviously make sure it doesn't look obsessive.  Or excessive?  Excessive, excuse me.  Wait, do you have...  We had five days off.  Excessive, yeah.  How much time can she get?  I think he'll keep her in jail for just a few months to let everything kind of just chill.  She can get four years.  If he feels like that's not excessive.  She can get four years.  She's not getting...  That's all?  They'll get some of that time served, taken off the four years. 
[00:37:00]  So...  I say less than six months is my guess.  I'm going to guess full four years.  I say they keep her for a little while just to let the circus die down a bit.  She's a pig.  I don't know.  All right, listen.  We got the defense attorney, Jeff Ashton, talking about what happened on The View.  Oh, it was on The View.  He's making the circus.  So then the verdict that we saw here, not guilty.  What went through your mind?  You expected her to be found guilty, didn't you?  Well, we thought she would. 
[00:37:30]  I mean, you always know that in a jury trial, anything can happen.  Yeah.  But we felt like we put on a good case and had enough evidence.  So, yeah, we were pretty shocked.  But that's the way it goes.  We understand that can happen.  And I think I mouthed wow about five times.  So when people say you didn't really prove the case, how does that make you feel?  It doesn't make me feel that bad.  I mean, we put on everything that an investigation, a really thorough investigation, over three years produced. 
[00:38:00]  So we put on every piece of evidence that was admissible, and we felt like we argued it as well as anybody could.  You know what the problem with the prosecution was, and I'm no expert, believe me, they really did kind of get bamboozled and brought in to the defense's game of just trying to throw in smokescreens with her being abused, sexually abused.  And all the things that the defense threw out there, instead of staying on track, the prosecution then would go up and cross-examine these witnesses that the defense brought up, and the defense brought them up for, like, nothing. 
[00:38:30]  It's like, so you're wasting your energy and resources.  A lot of the defense witnesses, when the judge asked, all right, cross, the prosecution went, no, we don't want to talk to this person.  Who gives a shit?  And by the way, let's go to as many facts as they could, but they really just let them hang themselves. 
[00:39:00]  And it worked, because one of the jurors said that, wow, with her home life being so, she alluded to that.  So you're right, the defense did rope them into it, and it worked.  They roped into it, and brought the prosecution into their game, where they shouldn't even have questioned some of those witnesses.  They should have just said, no, no, we don't want to cross-examine.  Not even worth it.  But let me bring up my fucking, you know, my DNA guy. 
[00:39:30]  Well, let me bring up my forensic guy, as far as, you know, anthropology expert.  Let me bring him up.  But, no, they got caught up in trying to defend against what the defense was saying.  Yep.  And that's why that bitch ain't got no fucking murder rap against her, motherfucker.  And she is cordially invited to my pool to scrape her little nose against the wall.  On the side of it.  Help clean up the blood.  Ah, yeah, you know. 
[00:40:00]  I'm sure she's good at cleaning up messes.  I'm sure she likes pools, too.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Another show called The Talk, which is a rip-off of The View.  I like the other show called The Walk.  The Walk, yeah.  Yes.  You walk the walk.  How about the chat?  How about the bomb?  That's all right.  I guess Julie Chen lost her fucking mind.  Oh, did she?  A lot of people losing their fucking minds over this thing.  But there's no real surprise here.  There really is no surprise here.  Everyone wanted to see her found guilty, but it wasn't happening.  And they thought she was, all that Twitter shit that I was doing over the past fucking 
[00:40:30]  month with this trial, all you saw were these women going, I can't wait until she's got  that needle in her arm and she's getting the death penalty.  I was like, really?  Really?  Well, they were waiting for that one moment where the prosecution said, aha, what about  this?  And they never had it.  Never had it.  Here's Julie Chen losing her mind.  We are in a very somber mood right now because the verdict in the K.C. Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  You okay?  Help me out here.  Okay.  Help me out.  Sorry, okay, so the verdict has come down.  And the K.C. Anthony, sorry.  Well, we don't have an IPF.  But let me just bring everyone up to speed.  Okay.  I did say, not guilty of first-degree murder. 
[00:41:30]  Get a hold of yourself.  Wow.  You're a fucking blubbering idiot.  You're a broadcaster first, you dummy.  You did the news forever before you got this talk show.  What's wrong with you?  Eddie from Bad Talk.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  It sucks, but it is what it is.  It's the fucking legal system.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a bummer, that's for sure.  Was she bawling, crying when O.J. got let off the hook? 
[00:42:00]  Was she crying on that one?  Oh, the verdict in, yeah, O.J.  No, I bet not.  I wish we had footage of her reading that.  You know, speaking of that, Ann, I have to say, Kim Kardashian.  Oh, she caught a lot of shit last night.  She wrote or tweeted, what?  Casey Anthony found not guilty.  I am speechless.  I had to jump on this one.  I wrote, your dad helped get O.J. off.  How are you speechless?  How are you speechless?  You should understand this game. 
[00:42:30]  She should have written back.  Did you see his face, though, when they said not guilty?  Right.  Robert Kardashian was the only one looking around like, what?  Well.  That motherfucker's guilty of sin.  Hey, your father was speechless as well.  Yeah.  He was like, what the fuck?  But I couldn't help it.  I had to fucking ask her, how are you fucking speechless?  A lot of these people just could.  If you went to, like, hashtag Casey Anthony and shit like that.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Hashtag Casey Anthony trial.  A lot of these people would just, and the majority of them women and moms themselves.  They don't understand the law women.  Yeah, they have, no, they don't.  They're too busy with their aprons on, making cookies.  They don't know anything about the law.  They just think, what's right is right.  They clap their hands.  They really, it is fun to watch some people that have no concept of the legal system trying  to process this and how this happened and just having no clue. 
[00:43:30]  Can they, can they, you know, if they find new evidence, can they try her again?  It's like, no, they can't.  Why didn't they make her talk?  They can't.  You got to tell them double Jeopardy is not making you watch Jeopardy double the amount  of times.  Ah, see, Chip, that's exactly it.  Hey, juror number three spoke out finally.  Juror number three.  I thought the juror, these people.  Yes.  They weren't going to talk.  They finally, they're finally coming forward a little bit.  Ah, a few of them. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's probably going to defend themselves.  They're being murdered in the media.  Juror number three had this to say.  She is juror number three, Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old training to become a nurse.  She told ABC's Terry Moran the reason the jury acquitted Casey Anthony, the prosecution  didn't prove its case.  How can you punish someone for something if you don't know what they did?  The prosecution wasn't able to give you a solid enough picture of how Kaylee died.  Do you see that picture?  I have no idea what it, like, they didn't even paint a picture for me to consider. 
[00:44:30]  And the biggest question, says Ford, was never answered.  How did little Kaylee die?  If you're going to charge someone with murder, don't you have to know how they killed someone  or why they might have killed someone or have something where, when, why, how?  Those are important questions that were not answered.  Fair enough, man.  I mean, it sucks, but it sucks, but fair enough in this country.  Exactly.  I don't want to ever have to depend on the judicial system myself, but, you know, it worked in 
[00:45:00]  this case.  They didn't prove their fucking case.  Yeah.  I think they couldn't.  I mean, literally, it was like one of those things where there's just DNA.  Nothing could help.  Yeah, there was nothing there, really.  It was in her house.  The duct tape was in her house, right?  It was the duct tape from her house over the kid's mouth?  Yeah, it was too, uh, but there, too many people had access to it.  Like, it wasn't just her.  It could have been the mother.  It could have been the fry ride, right, okay.  The whole thing with the, uh, chloroform and saying that, uh, there were so many searches  for the word chloroform on the computer. 
[00:45:30]  And then the mother said, you know, she was searching for chlorophyll and she put in chloroform.  Do you believe that?  And, no.  The mother was protecting her?  No, but I don't think there was chloroform.  I don't think chloroform is used either.  I think, here's another thing.  One of her boyfriends, and this was early on in the trial, and no one even brought this up,  put up a thing on Facebook.  Uh, you know those dumb little things people send you?  And it said, uh, get her with chloroform. 
[00:46:00]  It was, or win her over with chloroform.  And it was some chick, and it's just one of these goofy fucking web things you put on.  Um, and if she, if she saw that, let's say Casey Anthony saw that, and it's her boyfriend,  and it's like some chick, and it's like, win her over with chloroform, and she doesn't know what chloroform is?  Wouldn't she be like, I want to find out what this chloroform is, because I don't know what my boyfriend's talking about.  Right, right.  And on this little post that he put on Facebook, that, like, I search for shit where it's like, 
[00:46:30]  yeah, okay, you just search for some stuff.  And if people looked at it out of context, it looks sinister.  You're like, why the fuck is Anthony searching for that?  Yeah.  It looks sinister, but it's like, you know, to me, I don't think that made any sense.  Yes, 84 times you can search for chloroform.  Believe me, I've searched for other things, and tried.  And why, okay, oh, 84 times?  Why would you have to search 84 times?  Because once you search it once, you know what it is, so we'll give it a shit. 
[00:47:00]  These guys are making good points in front of you, but the problem is, they still didn't prove their fucking case in the end.  Yes, another piece.  There's a lot of suspicion, yes.  Yeah.  Of course, she's guilty of something, yes.  We need a Star Chamber situation here.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  One of that.  Until they had to go Hollywood and give you a message at the end that maybe this isn't the way to do things.  Yeah.  Stupid fucking Hollywood.  You know Star Chamber, right?  Michael Douglas.  Yeah, yeah.  And Hal Holbrook.  Who doesn't know a good Hal Holbrook movie?  Hal Holbrook. 
[00:47:30]  The first, what, four-fifths of the movie are great, and then they have to give you the little moral message that maybe we shouldn't take matters in our own hands.  But I love the concept where they got some people together to take care of people like Casey Anthony.  Take care of business.  When you know someone like Casey Anthony is guilty, but the court system isn't able to prove that, the Star Chamber people took care of business.  They take care of it?  Yeah.  They took the law in their own hands.  I think it was more blatant.  Huh?  In Star Chamber. 
[00:48:00]  You can't, no one could tell.  Like, she was involved in something, and that's a given.  And she didn't tell anybody that for 31 days her kid's missing.  That's a given.  But there's nothing there that says she did anything.  Can't we just kill her because it would make a lot of people very happy?  It probably would.  Can't we do that in America?  They would, uh, yeah.  Here's more juror three.  And what about Casey Anthony, who didn't report her daughter missing for 31 days while she carried on with a partying lifestyle? 
[00:48:30]  Did that have any bearing on the jury?  The behavior is very bad, but bad behavior is not enough to prove a crime.  This stupid juror is smart, man.  She's saying everything she should have said.  When I heard that they came up after about 11 hours of deliberation, you were like, uh-oh.  I'm like, no, I was like, she's not guilty.  That's what I mean.  That's what I mean by uh-oh.  I was like, I knew she wasn't guilty.  Of course.  They would have to sit there and make like they, if they're, especially a capital murder case, they would have to, even if they knew, they'd be like, we have to sit here for another at least 24 fucking hours. 
[00:49:00]  Or we're going to look like, you know, we're just throwing out a death penalty here.  I read the tweet that she was found not guilty in a house full of people.  A lot of people at Wheezes that day a couple days ago.  And yeah, the reaction was like, get, it was like unanimous.  Get the fuck out of here.  And then we turned on the TV and people were shocked. 
[00:49:30]  But honestly, you know, Anthony followed the case very closely.  I sort of followed it.  I was keeping tabs on it as well.  And there's no shock here.  No.  There's just no shock here.  Unfortunately.  Unfortunately, this is exactly what should have happened.  I had no surprise.  It sucks and people are bummed out and all that.  But they didn't put their case.  We should move forward because Uriah Faber is going to be here any second.  We should take a break.  But before we do, Jay Leno just had a moment with the Casey Anthony trial. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, he did?  I'll be honest.  I did not hear this.  Danny brought it to our attention.  So I want to listen to this.  I guess one of his jokes might not have gone well.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I don't get this.  In a stunning decision, Casey Anthony found, not guilty, not guilty.  You know what this means?  This means President Obama's economic team is now only the second most clueless people in America.  That's what it means. 
[00:50:30]  Did the mic on?  No, you're all good.  Now, what happened?  Jay.  Oh, Jay.  Oh, jeez.  Huh?  The mic, I'm out.  No, you could hear the timid.  I think it was just like people were like, oh.  Yeah.  That was actually a good joke, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's hear it again.  President Obama's economic team is now only the second most clueless people in America.  That's what it means.  Did the mic on?  Yeah.  No, you're all good.  Now, what happened?  Tell me what happened again. 
[00:51:00]  I don't think they heard the joke.  No.  Tell them again.  Tell them again.  And a stunning decision.  No, Casey Anthony was Casey Anthony found not guilty.  You know what this means?  Well, this means President Obama's economic team is now only the second most clueless people  in America.  That's what it means.  Exactly.  You know, I tell you, I don't get it.  Good for Jay.  Go with it.  That was funny.  Good for him.  Oh, my God.  Is this thing on? 
[00:51:30]  Hey, to be fair, Butch Worley from Birmingham writes, Bullshit, Opie.  Whoa.  How about Lacey Peterson?  No cause of death there.  What about cases where no body is found?  That juror's an idiot.  What?  The Casey Anthony has...  If you look at the Peterson, Scott Peterson trial, there was a timeline there.  He was in a boat when she went missing. 
[00:52:00]  There was a body with flesh on it that could be a time of death.  There was motive.  He was cheating.  There was a lot more there than there was here.  A lot more.  There's no...  When did she do it?  Riddle me this.  When did she kill the kid?  How did she kill the kid?  And why?  There.  Do you think she killed the kid? 
[00:52:30]  Or do you think it was by accident that she covered it up?  I have no idea.  I don't fucking know.  And apparently...  What's your hunch?  You're not a juror.  Here's my hunch.  Everyone has a hunch about this.  Which means nothing.  I don't think she said, hey, I'm going to kill this kid so I can have a good time.  Whether she was drugging the kid so she could go out, leaving it at home or whatever.  Maybe.  Maybe that.  Maybe the kid did climb up the fucking ladder and drown in the pool. 
[00:53:00]  Maybe then the father was freaking out and said, you know, boy, your mom's going to be mad.  We're in trouble here.  Or let's, you know, make this look like something else happened that didn't involve us.  And I'll take care of everything.  You just go back in the house.  There's a lot of things that could have happened.  And the defense threw all those out there.  But then how does she go about life for 31 days like that?  She's a psychopath. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  She fucking...  Her crazy eyes.  She was laughing in the courtroom.  You know, I'd have a face like I was constipated the entire time.  I would just be like...  Dude, my...  I mean, two days ago, my kid was choking on a Dorito.  Okay?  And it was a pretty serious thing.  Yeah.  And he's fine and all that.  Right?  We're fucking traumatized.  Like, I'm sitting here like I just want to go home.  Because it was an incident.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Parents go through.  And I'm thinking, 31 fucking days?  Knowing you have a dead kid?  Yeah.  That...  I can't even wrap my fucking head around that as a parent.  She, uh...  I can't even wrap my head around that.  She's a lunatic.  She's a fucking lunatic.  We had a choking incident two days ago.  And I'm out of my mind.  And it wasn't to the point where it was going to be some, you know, a real problem.  But it was still...  It was enough.  It was heavy.  It was a heavy incident. 
[00:54:30]  Jesus.  And this broad is walking around for 31 days knowing her kid's dead.  I can't even understand that on any level.  See that...  It's easy just to say, yeah, she's a fucking psycho.  That's the parental thing, too, that a lot of the people that were commenting are parents.  And they were fucking livid because they see their kid in that situation.  Everyone does.  And they're like, oh, my God.  No, everyone doesn't.  I didn't.  Dude.  Because I have no concept of a parent-like thing. 
[00:55:00]  No, man.  You brush everything.  Of course you do.  What if it was, God forbid, you know, another kid in your circle?  Oh, I understand.  Yeah, yeah.  Then they'd be livid, pissed.  But you're never going to get the feeling of your own kid and be able to put that together  with this situation and think, wow, I couldn't imagine that.  Right.  I just don't have it.  I'm not a parent, so I can't feel like a parent does.  I have niece and nephew and things like that, but that's just not the same. 
[00:55:30]  It's not the same relationship, you know?  I just can't.  I could be mad.  I could go like, holy shit.  And if, God forbid, anything happened to any of my family, yeah, I'd want to fucking burst  in and blast the person in the face.  Well, just imagine whoever you love in your life, just imagine they're gone, and then you  go through life for 31 days making believe nothing happened.  Maybe it doesn't even have to be a kid.  That's fucking creepy.  That is downright creepy, man.  That's serial killer creepiness that people just, you know, don't understand the mind of 
[00:56:00]  a serial killer.  That's some creepy ass shit to be able to go through life like that.  Yeah, it is.  She's, well, she is creepy.  You know?  I'll give you that.  But, Uriah's here.  We should take a break then.  All right.  We'll take a little break.  All right.  We'll get back to this, obviously.  It's the big story of the day.  Oh, yeah.  Even though we're a day late on this, but at least we're here.  Oh, yeah.  Doing a little of this and a little of that.  Uriah Faber next, and then a little later this morning, Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar are  stopping by to talk about the new season of Rescue Me. 
[00:56:30]  And I also want to know about Curb Your Enthusiasm, because Jimmy went to the premiere.  Yes, I did.  All right.  We've got things to do.  Stay there.  Hey, we've got to get Uriah Faber in here right away, man.  Uriah, how are you, sir?  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  What's up, brother?  How you doing, man?  How's your hand?  It's okay.  My right hand's bugged me just a little bit.  Is it?  But not too bad.  What happened there? 
[00:57:00]  Did you break it?  I didn't break it.  I mean, I can do most things.  I just...  Is it swollen?  I had a break a couple months back during my training camp, a little hairline fracture.  Oh, shit.  And then just 25 minutes of punching dude in the face.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Jam fingers and all that good stuff.  Yeah.  So, feels good.  Damn, man.  Did you know when the decision...  Because I was at the fight.  Did you know that they were going to give Cruz the decision?  No, I didn't.  I mean, I thought I'd done enough. 
[00:57:30]  And, you know, it was close.  Especially watching it afterwards.  I mean, I could see, you know, how it could have gone either way.  But I was definitely surprised.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How much do you weigh?  You're a small guy.  I'm about 154 right now.  Okay.  We were just saying that you weigh about as much as our producer.  But how...  Like, which, you know, he's a small guy.  But you must be easy to underestimate from people who don't know you're a fighter.  Just because you're a small dude.  And then they want to find out the hard way.  Fucking horrible move. 
[00:58:00]  Time or two in my day.  Yeah.  But not too much.  Not too much.  I, you know, I've had some experiences though.  Right.  College and all that good stuff where I had to put a person in his place.  What more days did you start fighting though?  Because you started in 2003.  What made you say, all right, this is what I'm going to do?  You know, I wrestled in college.  I was a Division I wrestler at UC Davis.  And it was one of those things where I just thought it would be fun.  And I knew I'd be good at it.  And it was illegal in California at the time. 
[00:58:30]  This is eight years, seven, almost eight years ago.  And I just got in touch with the promoter and said, hey, I want to do this.  Trained for a month and took a fight.  And it started from there.  I just fell in love with it.  And started training jiu-jitsu and kickboxing and boxing and all that stuff.  And it just never stopped, man.  The sport started growing.  And I was right in the middle of it.  How does it feel to be headlining the UFC event?  It was awesome, man.  It was really cool.  And, you know, we performed. 
[00:59:00]  We had a great fight also.  And look forward to doing it again.  He's a tough fucking dude, Dominic Cruz, man.  He literally throws his legs like jabs.  I was like, Jesus.  He really is a fighter.  He's a good fighter, man.  Yeah, he's pretty tough.  How bummed are you right now?  You obviously wanted to win.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not like the type of guy that likes to sit around and feel sorry for myself and dwell on things.  Especially when I had a fight like I did where I felt that I won.  I mean, I knocked him down three times and stuffed his takedowns and really blocked most of his kicks and stuff like that. 
[00:59:30]  So it's like I didn't get beat up in the fight.  As you can see, I'm not like...  Yeah, you're not all fucked up.  I had a worse time with my pool, if you've noticed.  You look worse than...  You look worse than Uriah.  I know.  And I was just getting out of a fucking pool.  This guy went to battle.  He's doing mixed martial arts.  I had a fight with a wall in my pool, and I look like a mess.  I ask that because you guys don't fight often. 
[01:00:00]  So do you take this loss all the way to the next fight?  Like, fuck, I just want to get back in there and get a win under my belt.  You know, like I said, I'm not a guy that dwells on stuff.  I've got a good life.  Yeah, I'm motivated to get back on the training and just look forward to my next fight.  They're already talking about having me fight in a couple months here, maybe three or four months.  So, you know, I've been competing since I was a little kid.  And I know how the sport is.  And I just, you know, put the... 
[01:00:30]  I think we're more bummed than he is because we're Team Uriah Faber.  Yeah.  No, I really...  I feel like fans...  I mean, I get to go out there and exert all my energy.  I get to punch this dude in the face.  I get to try my best.  And so I exert all the frustrations, you know.  And so I can, at the end of the day, say, all right, you know, win, lose, or draw.  You know, I got that out.  How good does it feel to fucking just belt somebody you don't like? 
[01:01:00]  It feels really good, man.  It feels really good.  That's one of the bright sides of the fight that I had.  You know, he and I had a little bit of a pass.  And I got to punch him really hard in the face and knock him down a couple times.  And it was fun.  That is great, man.  Walk right through his punches, I felt like.  No big deal, buddy.  You know, brush him off.  And it was good.  I look forward to doing it again.  I think if I was in that business, and obviously I don't even have a shot at anything like that,  I wouldn't want to know any of the guys. 
[01:01:30]  Because if you get along with one of the guys and now you have to fight them, that would be a little weird to me.  Yeah, it's a little weird like that.  But, I mean, it's a close brotherhood we have.  I mean, it's hard to do that.  Because we're also in a sport that's so new.  Throughout the years, the guys that have been there for a while, a lot of times, train together and stuff.  So, I mean, I've got three or four guys in the weight class that I've trained with throughout the years.  Because we were at different weight classes at times.  We're in different organizations.  And so, it's all, you've got to put that pass and make a sport of it. 
[01:02:00]  How come you don't like him?  Dominic?  Yeah.  We had a long history.  I was his only loss, and he's like a baby when it comes to losing.  And he was disrespectful a couple different times and just didn't click.  Yeah, he didn't seem like he hurt you at all.  And it was impossible to keep you down.  Like, he tried taking you down.  And I've never seen anybody get up faster when they were on the floor than you.  Yeah, in a wrestling match, those wouldn't even have been considered takedowns at all. 
[01:02:30]  And it's one thing we're dealing with the commission is we have a lot of judges that have no clue what they're doing.  They haven't fought.  We've got old dudes and chicks.  And the sport's been around since, like, 93, 94.  And, you know, a lot of these guys are coming over and don't want to lose their jobs from the boxing commissions and have never been in a wrestling match or jiu-jitsu school.  And so, I mean, it's hard to know what the heck they're looking at. 
[01:03:00]  So you'd probably want to get, eventually, retired fighters in there.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And I think that's what needs to happen.  There needs to be some sort of system for these judges to go through and say, all right, I understand this sport as well as the fighters.  Because right now the fighters understand it much better than the judges, which is weird.  Yeah, that is strange.  But obviously there's got to be a third fight now.  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah, it's going to be a good one.  There's going to be a lot of interest in a third fight. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I think so.  And I've got to get in there and make sure I win my next fight.  I don't know if they'll do the rematch right away.  Probably not.  But I just want to fight somebody who's on the top and knock them down and get that shot again.  Get that belt.  Of your fights, I think you were 21-4 and then you've lost four in the last eight.  You've kind of split.  But none of them have been beat-ups.  Like, they've all been, I think, three out of the four decisions.  So it's like you're going the distance.  You're not being embarrassed.  There's 24-5 is, I think, my record now.  25-5, I think.  25-5, yeah. 
[01:04:00]  What's happened in the last eight fights?  Is it like people, it was almost like Fedor was relying on his one big punch.  And I think people kind of figured that out.  Is there something you were doing that people might have figured out?  Or is there something you want to do different?  Well, you know, I lost to Mike Brown twice.  The first time I did this crazy jumping elbow and kind of clotheslined myself into a punch.  And that was some years ago.  And then I fought him in a rematch.  I broke my hand in the first round, which was, you know, I hit him on the top of the head and fractured. 
[01:04:30]  The two metacarpal in my right hand had to get steel plates in there and stuff.  And that was the very first round of a 25-minute fight.  And then I dislocated my thumb in the third, so I was fighting with no hands.  And then...  Were you still using your right hand?  No, just elbows.  I was doing elbows.  So you couldn't even use it at all?  I couldn't grapple, couldn't do anything.  Oh, what the fuck?  Yeah, it was rough.  People out there have watched me fight.  I mean, they're always...  Everyone always asks me, how's your hand?  And that was two fights ago, two years ago. 
[01:05:00]  And they're always asking about that fight, but...  I met you once.  We got a photo together.  You were in a sling.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were fucking...  I don't know what happened, but...  Oh, yeah.  Can you see that?  That was from the fight, yeah.  I had two casts from that fight.  So basically, I've fought 30 times now, and I think about 20 fights have been in title fights.  So when you're at the highest level and the sport's getting where it is, and I was also  at a weight class, 145 pounds, where I was giving up a lot of weight just because this 
[01:05:30]  sport started some years back, and there was no weight basketball.  Oh, yeah.  You'd get like a smaller guy and some huge guy in there and just beat the shit out of  each other.  Yeah.  In the old days.  You know, it's one of those things where you're fighting the best guys in the world.  All my losses have been in title shots.  Is it embarrassing to lose a fight?  I've asked fighters that before because I'm afraid to fight for a couple of reasons.  A, you don't want to get hurt, first and foremost. 
[01:06:00]  But it's like the embarrassment of losing.  But I guess it's different when it's two guys who really know how to fight.  But is there like a feeling like, I don't want to walk through the crowd?  Or is it no?  No, not, I mean, possibly, I guess, if you did something embarrassing.  But most of the time, we're just fighting each other like warriors out there.  And, you know, nothing to be ashamed about.  Well, Silva got knocked out in the first round.  Like, he had a really bad fight.  Yeah.  Like, at least, Silva got really beat up quickly.  That's got to suck when you have to leave.  That does.  That does suck, I'm sure. 
[01:06:30]  But, you know, that guy's been through some battles, wars.  The best exit ever was, I think it was Philly we were at?  Oh, yeah.  With Forrest Griffin?  Yeah.  He got knocked out.  And we love Forrest.  He's been on our show.  Yeah.  But he felt pretty embarrassed, I think.  Yeah, he was.  And he got knocked out and then immediately ran out of the arena.  I remember that.  I was there also.  That was the best exit ever.  That was a good exit.  He was like, fuck, he was so mad and embarrassed at the same time.  He kind of got caught with a punch that was like, you know, Silva was going away. 
[01:07:00]  He just kind of threw like almost a jab and knocked him out.  But Forrest Griffin was moving forward and it just, oh my God, it was just one of those moments.  People started to know Uriah Faber big time, like people that aren't in the fight game or are fans of the sport when you tweeted the picture of your leg.  That brought a lot of people into your camp.  Yeah, that was nasty, man.  That's the other loss that I've had recently was to Jose Alda, who's, you know, one of the top pound for pound guys right now. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  And he's the champ at the weight above where I'm competing.  That's when I knew that you were a sick fuck.  I'm like, this guy was tweeting pictures of his leg just getting worse and worse by the day.  Oh my gosh.  That was like a three-week process.  And I've been a fan ever since now.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, it was like a three-week process of my leg just changing colors and size and everything else.  I'm like, look, it was just interesting.  What's it going to look like tomorrow?  As soon as you came in, I decided to Google it, too.  I mean, you Google image Uriah Faber leg.  You can see what I'm talking about.  It was like he beat you, but he just basically kicked your leg. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, exactly.  But he didn't break anything, obviously.  No, it was just all soft tissue and just pain, man.  And yeah, to his credit, he's one of the best fighters in the world.  And I mean, he'd been knocking everyone out.  We went to a 25-minute fight with him just kicking me in the leg.  It was like someone taking a bat to my leg.  And the guy found a weakness and exploited it, you know?  How many times, how many kicks in do you start to go like, oh, this is going to be a fucking problem?  Oh, sure.  Like he figured out that this is a good move.  It was right around the end of the second round, so I had three rounds hobbling around 
[01:08:30]  where he kind of took the power out of my leg.  And I got to ask, and this is probably going to be a rookie question, but what the fuck?  Like, if any of us got kicked once in our thigh, we would be done.  We wouldn't be walking.  We'd be on the ground.  We'd be like, what the fuck?  We'd be calling out for our mommies.  How could you get kick after kick in a leg like that and continue?  A lot of guys don't.  I mean, a lot of people say it's training, but I don't understand. 
[01:09:00]  Well, I would say a lot of guys don't.  There's been a lot of TKOs from guys having to stop because their leg's getting battered.  But one kick would take us out.  Yeah, that's one of the more painful things in the sport.  It's just a, I mean, you really imagine taking a bat and swinging it and just slam it into  somebody's leg.  Fuck, like constant beating like that.  And then you've got to continue fighting.  I just can't wrap my head around that.  I guess, is there a numbness that comes with it? 
[01:09:30]  Because Ali fought Ken Norton.  He had a broken jaw for quite a few rounds.  I mean, Norton had broken his jaw and he kept fighting, I think, for like, you know,  10 rounds or whatever with a broken jaw.  Is there something where you just get used to it?  Um, I would say no, but there's definitely a ton of adrenaline that takes away from whatever  pain you have.  Like directly after the fight that I asked, the doctors asked me how I felt and I'm like,  I feel fine.  I feel great.  And then in the press conference, uh, 10, 15 minutes later, uh, my collarbone was, had 
[01:10:00]  a little hematoma.  My rib was hurting.  My leg was hurting and my right hand was hurting.  And, and, uh, so that stuff wears off and you're like, ah, okay, I'm a little ache  and pain here, you know, you ever have to shit right before you fought?  Like what's the closest to fight?  Cause when I do a show, a lot of times I, I'm not trying to compare what I do with what  you're, but I have to, I have to empty out.  My body just goes now and I have to shit probably 10 minutes before going on stage.  That's nerves, right?  Yeah.  My body just panics and throws everything out.  You know, I, not, not in particular that I can remember, but I'm, I'm sure I've had to 
[01:10:30]  go to the bathroom at some point, but not, not like, uh, something that sticks  out in my mind.  That's not a real professional question to ask somebody.  We've had a few, uh, weak questions.  I'm just kidding.  I am curious though.  These are some of the things that people wonder about.  Yeah.  What do you do when you're on the road?  Like you're in New York now.  How long are you here for?  I'm just here for three days.  And what will you do?  Uh, I mean, you gotta promote, but.  I'm doing just a bunch of cool interviews and, uh, hanging out and getting some great food.  I mean, you guys are spoiled out here. 
[01:11:00]  I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  And then, uh, I've got a bunch of friends out here.  So if I get some time, I'd, you know, what's your food of choice?  Uh, you know, my favorite restaurant is Carmine's and last time when I fought here, I, after  the, uh, I was here for about four or five days.  I ate there every single night for dinner.  And it just reminds me of my mom's cooking.  She's Italian.  Oh, that family style where there's like a fucking giant plate.  So good.  Carmine's rules.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  Um, I'm going to try to get that for lunch tonight, actually, too. 
[01:11:30]  So you always laugh when people come here, uh, to New York and go to like the Olive Garden.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I went to an awesome restaurant last night, August.  Uh, it's called August.  And, and the chef there is a big fan and he just kept bringing the stuff out.  And, uh, you know, my cousin Peter, he lives here and, and we had a, we had a really good  meal.  So it was, he was bringing out all sorts of different dishes.  How is it too, when you're on the, as a fighter with, uh, with, with women, uh, are they more 
[01:12:00]  attracted?  Like, let's just say, uh, do you do well?  Uh, let's say, yeah, I would say yes, I do well.  And, uh, I mean, I've never really had an issue with, with the women area, but, um, I mean,  I think it probably helps that, you know, women like guy that can provide and protect  and all that good stuff.  And, and, uh, it doesn't help your, I mean, it doesn't hurt you on TV and so you like the  beach.  Like to me, the beach is a place of torture and humiliation and like shame. 
[01:12:30]  I was thinking of that while I was watching him fight.  I'm like, this is a guy who like would like, Oh, it's great.  Let's go to the beach that like, I have to be convinced to go to the beach as a part of  a greater day.  You're just horrified.  I fucking hate it.  I wear my shirt.  I wore my shirt and jeans on the beach.  How do you feel when, and you know, it's time to take your shirt off?  I'm such a fucking mess.  I'll actually take my shirt off.  I know the girl is looking the other way and I'll throw my towel over my shoulders.  So my tics don't show.  It's fucking embarrassing.  You just got to wear it, bro. 
[01:13:00]  I know some guys with some, you know, pushy little dopey little bodies that, uh, just rock  out with their shirt off in California, man.  It's a, uh, it's just a mentality, bro.  You got to wear that.  All pasty white, right?  Yeah, I know.  I can't wear it proudly.  He's probably right.  But if I was hanging out with him and the beach and there's no way to wear this where  women wouldn't know, well, you walk around strutting your stuff and you look, and you  look like crap.  Girls would be like, what does he have that we don't know about?  Jimmy's great.  Intrigued. 
[01:13:30]  Jimmy's great in the jacuzzi.  Because the second the bubbles shut off, he's like, turn the bubbles back on.  It just covers everything up.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's because when the fucking water gets clear and you can just look down, you're like, oh,  what a fucking piece of garbage.  But we've talked to enough UFC guys where it's like you almost start to convince yourself,  like, you know, like, yeah, man, that's something that's possible.  You work out a little bit, you get in shape, and you forget that there's fucking, what,  eight hours a day or seven hours a day it takes to get in that kind of shape.  Oh, yeah.  And, I mean, it's a lifestyle type of thing, but there's some guys that are fighters that 
[01:14:00]  don't have the best physiques either and do pretty well, so, you know, you can do all  right.  It's all mental, man.  Come on.  Even without fighting, though, you're a guy who just got, like, a lot of chicks.  I've never had an issue with getting chicks throughout my life.  I always have.  I always have.  You want to be him, don't you?  I really do.  I like being me, but I would love to, if I could be Uriah.  Well, you guys should switch jobs for one weekend.  Why would he want to do that?  Oh, yeah.  Uriah, you get on stage, tell some jokes. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, you get up at 530 in the morning, do radio, and I'll just fucking, I'll be in  perfect shape and fucking punch people I hate and bang chicks.  Why wouldn't he take that deal?  Hey, what are we promoting today, by the way?  I think we have some copies of this.  Yeah, we're talking about the UFC personal trainer, and that's actually why I'm here in New York  talking about this, and I'm going to go play the game and everything.  Where are you playing it?  We're going to do it on the morning show.  I can't remember what exactly the show is.  TV or radio?  TV. 
[01:15:00]  And doing a bunch of radio stuff, but the UFC personal trainer is the new game.  It's basically for guys to get in shape.  It's available on the Wii and the Kinect and the Nintendo Move, the PlayStation Move and  the Nintendo Wii, and it basically is all the workouts that we do.  I mean, you can do like 70 different workouts in kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and it's  stimulated.  You know, you stand in front of the Kinect or the Wii and just throw punches. 
[01:15:30]  You can hold mitts.  I'm one of the characters on there.  They have you do all the voiceovers and stuff.  So you pick me, and they're like, good job.  And I change it to like, good stuff, homie, and stuff like that.  So it's pretty cool.  You know, you can do mitt work.  You can do bag work.  You can do, you know, timed workouts, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 30-day regimen, 60-day regimen.  And it's just a way to get in shape without being intimidated to go learn about the sport. 
[01:16:00]  What's the shortest workout that somebody might want to do during their early 40s?  Well, you can just put it right in the middle of it, but they have these 30-second and one-minute  goes where they count how many punches you're throwing and your accuracy, and they give you  advice.  There's some of the trainers, some of the best trainers and fighters that are on the game  also, and they'll be like critiquing you and giving you pointers and stuff like that.  See, because I hate my stomach.  I've talked about this with every fighter that's in, but I just, I hate my torso. 
[01:16:30]  My legs are good.  I have good calves, but I fucking, I don't know what to do for my stomach.  Oh, he's got the best calves in the business.  I want to show you how I am.  Yeah, I'll take a picture later and we'll Twitter those.  In the business.  Yeah, we should.  We should Twitter our calves and see if you can guess who's who.  It'll be a fun game that nobody will play.  Yeah, that's classic.  Nick in Jersey says he's a big, fat fuck and would love a copy of that workout video.  That's awesome.  Let me say hi to Nick for a second.  Nick.  Hey, how you guys doing?  We're talking to Uriah Faber, just in case people are just tuning in. 
[01:17:00]  Uriah, big fan.  It was an awesome fight, man.  Oh, thank you, man.  I wish you were, man.  I wanted to see you win that title, but no.  Hey.  I'll be back in there.  Exactly, man.  Exactly.  Yeah, he's got the confidence.  I love it, man.  He just lost and he's like, fuck that.  I'm already past that moving forward.  That's right.  You want this game, sir?  Oh, you know it.  All right.  Hold on a line.  I think we got five copies, so we'll give you one.  Man, see.  You got a question for Uriah while you're on the phone?  Um, actually, I just turned on the radio. 
[01:17:30]  I'm driving the work, so I don't want to.  Great story.  Yes.  Cool.  Hold on.  Stay there.  How fast are you going?  What road?  Quick.  More.  More.  Stay there.  We'll give you a copy.  Chris in New Hampshire.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, Uriah, you got to tell the story about, uh, I heard it, I don't know when, um, you  got in a bar fight in some, uh, town, maybe Mexico or someplace weird like that, where  you ended up fighting, like, the entire town.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  That was Bali, Indonesia.  Yeah.  Who the fuck would do that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to tell the story, man.  It's friggin', I don't know where I heard it, but it's...  I'll tell you where you heard it.  You heard it on this show, because Uriah called in one time and told us the story, sir.  Yeah, I do.  I do remember.  Yes.  But he's here, so we should...  Why don't we retell it?  That's a long story.  But it was Indonesia.  That's crazy.  It was a crazy story, man.  I, uh, if you look up Uriah Faber Bali on YouTube, I tell the story.  It's like a nine-minute video, and excuse the F-bombs, but I was, you need some F-bombs 
[01:18:30]  to describe that story.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We prefer any story with F-bombs.  Saying fuck helps any story.  Oh, yeah.  You can say fuck here, by the way.  Yeah, you can.  I don't know if you know that.  I helped that fucking old lady across the street.  It just sounds like a nicer story.  Yeah.  It makes us seem cool.  That's funny.  So you think you would play this game if, uh...  I absolutely know I would, because I...  I would check it out, yeah.  You could do it.  No one watches.  You could put your shirt...  Take your shirt off.  You could practice the bravado of having your shirt off with this thing.  I go to the gym. 
[01:19:00]  I do elliptical.  And, uh, all I do is elliptical, because I hate...  I despise working out.  Like the ladies.  They all do the elliptical.  They really do.  I put on my fucking yoga pants.  I really have a fucking...  This game is actually the only game that, uh, is endorsed by the National Academy of  Sports Medicine.  So you can be rest assured that you're going to be getting a workout.  And it's, it's, uh...  Just like the chicks that get on those ellipticals, uh, that has some clout, you know?  I've done some things with, uh, Kinect, on, uh, Xbox Kinect. 
[01:19:30]  And, uh, you are exhausted when you're done.  Oh, yeah.  You are really moving.  Yeah, it's genius.  I remember, uh, I mean, they have these games.  Like, do you ever see the dance game?  I've seen some of the most hilarious...  Yeah.  ...dance, like, nerd fighter, uh, like, video game guys.  Yeah.  ...at, like, the arcade doing this intense dance.  They, like, got their entourage there with all, like, the best dancer video game guy.  And he's, like, his hair's slicked back.  He's got, like, this chick. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, he's dancing.  He's, like, dancing, all, like, stepping on stuff.  Dance Revolution?  Yeah.  It's so funny, man.  I think I would rather do that in the privacy of my own home.  I've done some, some, uh, boxing games on, uh, Xbox.  I'd love to check this out.  But, but just to hold your arms up that long and keep throwing punches and throwing punches,  you're home.  You're in your living room.  Believe me, it's not, it's not the ring.  Yeah.  But, wow, man, it is hard work.  It really is.  And this is cool.  I mean, you're gonna actually learn. 
[01:20:30]  I mean, you, this is the real stuff that we're doing.  And you've got guys like, uh, Mark Delagradi and, uh, Javier Mendez, some of the best trainers  in the world, that are telling you, all right, showing you the right techniques and stuff.  I mean, I have a gym at home and the biggest thing are people are intimidated to go in  there and look dumb, you know?  So this whole thing is a precursor to that.  You can learn all the technique, hop in there and, uh, you know, go to the gym and, and not  feel like a weirdo if you want to step it up.  Uh, everyone's calling for a copy of the game. 
[01:21:00]  So we have four left and we'll just give them to some random callers right now.  Wait, do we have any, uh, is this good for, uh, I have a PlayStation three.  Does it work on PlayStation or no?  Yeah, it works on PlayStation Move, Nintendo Wii, and Xbox Connect.  And it's called the Ultimate Fitness, wait, no, it's called UFC Personal Trainer, right?  UFC Personal Trainer.  My gym back home is Ultimate Fitness, though.  Yeah, I got you.  So thanks for the plug.  Oh, no, no.  Uh, Dan in Rochester has a question for Uriah Faber.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I had a question.  Um, was there any, like, one instant or one moment in your life that made you want to 
[01:21:30]  keep on going and have persistence and never want to give up?  Like, I know one time when I was younger, I was bullied a little and, like, it made me  want to go out and kick everyone's butt.  But, uh, did you have anything like that or, like, a role model in your life that kept you  going?  You know, I think the biggest thing for me is just having a really positive attitude.  And, uh, I, I think I get that from my dad.  I mean, he's been in some pretty dire straits and, and the guy's just always happy and, 
[01:22:00]  and, you know, it's like nothing phases him.  And so I kind of learned that from him, but there's been all sorts of struggles, man,  that, that, uh, you know, motivated me.  And, and that's the biggest thing is just looking for, for motivation and things instead  of feeling sorry for yourself or, or getting down, you know, it's, it's just kind of a  mindset for me.  But yeah, there's been a lot of stuff.  I can't think of anything in particular, but, uh, you know, just having that mental attitude  is, is kind of the key.  Like when's the last time you were scared of a person like legitimately, like from being 
[01:22:30]  I had a guy on one time on a train, um, it was weird.  It was like, he was sitting across from me and I had sunglasses on and he, he looked  like a fucking guy off Rikers Island.  He did not look like a pleasant man.  And we're both kind of leaning forward facing across from each other, but I wasn't, he thought  because the way my sunglasses were, like I was looking kind of like down, but he thought  I was, I know what he thought.  Cause he thought that I was like eyeballing him, but I really wasn't.  But I, I understand why he thought that.  And, uh, he actually just took his sunglasses off and looked at me. 
[01:23:00]  Holy shit.  And, um, I was, I was thinking of after we got off the train and I moved my head up and  looked so he knew that I hadn't been eyeballing him cause I don't want to get the ship yet.  I need to prove a point to nobody but me and my iPod.  Did you exaggerate that movement?  Like I am now looking up.  I think I actually went, I made a fucking scooges noise.  But, but fucking stinks.  And you gotta be careful cause anybody can have a pistol.  Like you never know who's going to pull on you.  So it's like, you can't be crazy fucking brave, but it just sucks. 
[01:23:30]  Like knowing that that guy, uh, he pumped me.  It was fucking, it was annoying.  How long ago was that?  Fucking on my way in.  You need to get on the UFC personal trainer.  You need to get the confidence up there.  But no, for me, I haven't, uh.  I need to pay you to just walk around with me.  Yeah.  He fought, he fought a village in Indonesia.  This guy's never been scared.  I really, I can't really say that I have been, I've been unrealistically unscared since  I was a little kid. 
[01:24:00]  The only person I was really scared of was my mom.  Wow.  And, uh, that's still today.  You're still scared of her?  Oh yeah.  For what reason?  I don't know, man.  She's got that mental, I guess it'd be like equivalent to like a big brother edge, you  know?  Yeah.  But, uh, it'd be, it'd be my mom.  Like that's the one person where like if she calls and she's pissed off at me, I'm like,  Oh, you know, she understands that you're really famous, right?  Ah, or does she just brush that aside?  Like it's a cute little thing you do when you're not in, in her house. 
[01:24:30]  You know, I mean, mom's a mom, you know, what is your mentality when you, cause if you're  not used to, you've never been afraid of people, what is your mentality when it's not a fight  or when it's, it's a one-on-one thing, what do you do?  Like, I really can't comprehend handling that situation differently.  Like what could I, I, in that situation, I could have looked at him, but it would have  escalated immediately.  Like it's just, it's just like being on that beach.  I think where you, you know, uh, it's like confidence thing. 
[01:25:00]  I, I've avoided a lot of fights by people realizing right away that I'm have zero fear or intimidated  of what they're saying or doing.  It's a, just a crusher.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, it's like, you know, you call someone's bluff and, and 90% of the time they're  going to, you know, they're going to feel like, Oh my gosh, this guy is not scared of  me at the least bit.  I've had that a ton of times in college where somebody has gotten in my face and I've gotten,  instead of backing away, you get a little bit closer and stay calm. 
[01:25:30]  And that's scary for people like, Oh man, this guy has like iron nerve and really believes  he's going to kick my ass.  Jimmy, when, when, when that happened, wouldn't you have like maybe put the sunglasses down  on your nose while you're still looking down and then kind of look up at him?  Like, like, look, I wasn't looking at you, but now I noticed you're looking.  You're looking at me and I'm going to look at you now.  No, I wouldn't have done that because first of all, it's an acknowledgement that I'm,  I'm reacting to what he did. 
[01:26:00]  So that was why I did.  But again, I have a pretty good read instinctively for people in violence.  Like I've always been a very good read of that.  This guy was not, he was 10 to 10%.  He was not one through 90 who wanted to, most people want a way out of a fight.  Yeah.  And then there are the 10% that don't.  Sometimes you got to take the loss.  You just know it's like, fuck.  Yeah.  Just get myself out of this.  Oh, right, right, right.  You know what I mean?  The other thing is the old sucker punch.  If you feel like you're going to get in a fight 100% for sure, know where to hit a person, 
[01:26:30]  which means on the button, on the kisser, what they say.  On the chin, yeah.  On the chin.  And be ready to run or do whatever else.  There's no shame in that.  There's no shame in throwing the first punch and, you know, karate people out there who, you know, say don't throw the first punch.  If I feel some big weirdo is trying to start a fight with me, I'm not going to say anything at all to him.  I'm going to punch him right in the face.  Just punch him in the face.  And at the end of it.  Gone.  And for the people listening out there, that's the place to hit, right on the chin? 
[01:27:00]  I would hit him in the chin.  Because I hear pull his ears, fucking try to kick him in the balls.  No, you've heard all these dumb things.  Try to gouge out his eyes.  But you're saying if you've got one fucking shot, just try to hit that chin.  Punch through his chin.  From the side?  Anywhere you can hit it.  You can hit him in the jaw.  From the jaw to the chin to the upper lip.  That's the spot to hit.  Just right there.  It's really.  Oh, yeah.  That does suck.  And you can.  I mean, you see some of the best knockouts. 
[01:27:30]  Some of the best punches.  Guys are barely getting touched there.  They'll get hammered big punches here and there.  Yeah.  You guys get this UFC personal trainer.  And they'll tell you exactly where to hit and how to do it.  To where you can, however much you weigh, you can deliver that punch to someone's jaw.  If they're staring at you like a weirdo in the subway.  Now, I want you to remember this moment from when you read on fucking the drug report.  Radio host murdered on train.  That's in dire sense.  When you know a guy's going in your face and like, okay, this guy is coming to fight me. 
[01:28:00]  And instead of trying to talk your way out or whatever.  And you feel like even if I talk him out of it and the guy's not backing down.  I had a real experience where a guy was not going to back down for no reason.  And I had to let him go.  I was walking home with a girl in college.  And I turn around.  This guy's got a fire extinguisher.  He's got about 100 pounds on me.  And he wants me to apologize. 
[01:28:30]  And I had never seen the guy.  And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.  I think you have the wrong guy.  It's nice.  I just had to apologize, motherfucker.  Did you hear what I said?  And I'm like, hey, bro, I think you got the wrong guy.  And, you know, I was wearing like khakis and a polo shirt.  And this chick standing next to me, I'm walking my bike home.  And so he persists about three requests and gets closer to my face.  He's holding this fire extinguisher.  And I just laid him out.  He did like a walking circle. 
[01:29:00]  I hit him.  He walked in a circle, turned back around, walked in front of me, and just fell on his butt.  And I go, here's your apology, motherfucker.  And I grabbed the back of his head and just jaw jacked him twice.  And he just passes out.  And then I was borrowing my buddy's shoes.  I had big old shoes on.  So he fell onto my leg and slid down my shoes.  And my shoe came off underneath him.  And his buddy comes running up.  I'm trying to pick him up, get my shoe.  And he's like, stay away from him.  I'll get your shoe.  I'll get your shoe. 
[01:29:30]  And then the guy wakes up.  And he ends up not knowing what's going on.  He tries to fight his buddy, all this stuff.  The chick's like 300 yards down there.  But, you know, there's a time everyone's always should hit somebody.  I swear to God,  I thought he was going to go.  I had to apologize because he had a fire extinguisher.  That story went exactly the opposite of how I thought it was going to go.  Or how you would have handled it.  Oh, yeah.  I would have said, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Very sorry.  When I did it wrong, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Well, I mean, when there's nothing to apologize,  my intuition is, okay, this guy really doesn't want to apologize. 
[01:30:00]  He doesn't want me to apologize because I didn't do anything to him.  I've never seen the guy.  He's just trying to start a fight with me.  Oh, okay.  You know.  Yeah.  At what age did you realize you were a tough guy,  that you could take care of yourself?  I mean, it couldn't have been your whole life.  There had to be a turning point where you said,  all right, now I know I can take care of myself.  No, I was unrealistically thinking I was a tough guy ever since I was a little kid.  I mean, I remember thinking as a little kid,  these teenagers that if I needed to, I could handle them, you know.  And I think it comes from having my mom who's always been, 
[01:30:30]  my mom and my dad are just like pump me up all the time, you know.  Okay.  You know, my mom like, nobody, nobody messes with my boys.  My boys can dance.  My boys can, my boys can do this.  My boys can do that, you know.  The Italian mom just like pumping you up.  Right.  You got brothers then.  Yeah, I got an older brother.  Is he in the fight game?  No, he's not in the fight game.  But he can take care of himself?  Yeah, he can take care of himself.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's 5'11", 185 pounds. 
[01:31:00]  I don't know.  And my little sister, she's 18, she's 5'8".  I got gypped, dude.  How tall are you?  Like 5, almost 5'6".  Okay.  I'm a little over 5'6", but I say 5'7".  Not for the guy on the train.  No, I don't say anything to him.  The guy on the train, I said nothing.  But I'll tell you what.  I knew that he was, I knew he thought I was doing something I wasn't doing.  It wasn't like he just spotted me. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  And fucking, he really did think I was just leaning up and staring at him.  So he was like, what the fuck?  That's good you set the record straight then.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had to.  I had to just look up and like, oh, no, I wasn't.  And I looked around and pretend I'm texting on the fucking train.  And he sees I have an iPhone.  Of course, I don't get perception in the subway.  So I guess that was enough.  To admit, I should have just mimicked the blowjob motion.  That would have been fucking more masculine than the way I handled it.  Yeah, I like this.  Keith.  Keith from Long Island.  Keith, go ahead.  Hey, yeah, how you doing, guys?  I'll tell you, I'm not really the super fan of MMA, but this guy's real. 
[01:32:00]  I like hearing him talk.  He's well-spoken.  And, you know, just hearing him come in and talk like this, he's got a new fan.  And I'm just trying to get the game.  You know what?  That means Uriah did his job today.  That's cool.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  You're not really into UFC and you're sitting there listening to what he has to say.  He just brown-nosed us.  Do we give him a game?  Yeah, I would.  Of course. 
[01:32:30]  Do we have a brown-nosed?  Oh, we gave him all away?  We don't have another one laying around?  Go pick one up then.  I think we gave him all away, Keith, but I'll put you on hold just in case we've got one  laying around.  Yeah, call Best Buy and say something nice to the guy.  See if he'll fucking give you one.  We should get Uriah out of here because we've got Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar coming in  now.  Okay.  Oh, that's good.  And he's busy doing his TV and everything else.  Oh, by the way, here's the show that Uriah's going to be on.  Kenny texted me before to do the visual.  Okay.  It's A Good Day in New York on Fox.  Oh, really?  Nice.  This morning at like 940. 
[01:33:00]  Good deal, man.  Oh, yeah.  Seen that show?  Of course.  Good stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  Good stuff.  Hey, you know, this used to be Scotty Farrell's...  Oh, you know Scotty?  This used to be his office.  Is this where he was?  Yeah, yeah.  We redesigned this place.  Yeah, it looks a little different.  We took all our TVs from the other joint and brought them in here.  The rest of the place is mad at us.  I've seen Scotty do a full-on air guitar concert by himself.  Yeah, he's out of his mind.  In this room.  Yeah, Scotty's out of his fucking mind. 
[01:33:30]  He got applause from millions of people that weren't really there and all sorts of crazy  stuff.  Is he still on?  He's on service, right, still?  Yeah, he works when we're not here.  Where's he broadcast?  We don't really run into him.  Oh, I guess out of here.  Okay.  Yeah, he's not too far from here.  He's a couple down.  Yeah.  I know nothing about other people on the platform.  I probably should.  I just don't.  You keep it in your own world, man.  That's way of luck.  But that's like you saying, is Liddell a fighter?  Like, you know.  You know who's in your fucking game.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  By the way, I guess there's nothing, because your hand hurts. 
[01:34:00]  We usually get fighters to do something to me.  That is true.  I've had guys put me.  That would be great if you didn't say another word and he just clocked you in the face as  hard as he could.  Don't get my face.  And he punched the gum out of my mouth.  You know how humiliating is when a man punches your gum out?  That's the move.  That's the move.  Let's see if he can punch the gum out of your mouth without breaking your jaw.  What have we had?  Brock has put me in a fucking, what's the leg one that could really hurt you?  Knee bar?  That was it.  And an ankle bar.  And he put, and Fedor put me in a fucking, he was a sadist, though. 
[01:34:30]  Like, he put me in some kind of an arm.  Yeah, Fedor.  A couple of times.  He was smiling.  How about I do the Game Maker, which is like, just basically.  What's this called?  The Game Maker.  This is what we should do.  Ah!  Wait, he already did it?  Dude, he finally did it?  That sound was great, Jimmy.  What the hell, man?  That's it right there.  He took my forearm.  Wait, we didn't see it, Jimmy.  What did he do?  You're right.  Can you do it again?  Because we didn't really see it.  It is. 
[01:35:00]  Keeping the hand down like that.  Now, do you do this when you're actually fighting?  That fucking hurts, man.  He takes your forearm and he pulls your wrist down.  Yeah.  How much of that can you take?  Can you take a little more of that?  Yeah.  Probably a little bit more than that.  That really hurts.  Yeah.  When do you do that?  Mostly when you mess around with your buddy.  When you're on a subway and some asshole's eyeballing you, staring at you.  That's some Hapkido stuff.  That's like the cop stuff.  You know, they like grab you and do this and twist your arm.  It's like, all right, all right, all right.  I'm not doing anything anymore. 
[01:35:30]  That really fucking caught me off guard.  And it's fine now.  But I mean, that was very unpleasant.  That means you can take another one, I'm thinking.  I'd prefer not to.  What would you say is one you'd do without hurting your hand that you enjoy doing?  Well, rear naked choke would be fine.  I could do that.  Who did that on me?  I had that.  I think it was, I want to say Couture, rear naked choke.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We had an epic battle.  Oh, yeah, epic.  It's funny.  I saw him this week at UFC and he wanted a rematch.  You know, a couple of combatants.  And I had a guillotine put on me one time, too. 
[01:36:00]  That was really unpleasant.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think he did it.  I think he...  Yeah, it hurt a lot.  That really hurt.  Then Anderson kicked me.  But he wouldn't, he didn't want to kick me hard.  No.  Like, he...  That's probably wise.  You don't have to...  Yeah, yeah, you would have been fucked up.  But this is...  But why could other guys get kicked hard by him and not...  Someone said if Jimmy took a real kick from him, he could die.  He gave me...  I had a headache for two hours after that because my head jostled.  And people just say, well, it's in the training.  But I would say, you know, you train your whole body to understand, you know, what the heck's happening to it. 
[01:36:30]  And if you don't...  If your body has no clue and you don't have the muscle and all the training to support, you know, whatever's happening to you.  I mean, yeah, it could be dangerous for sure.  And you don't know what the proper way is to take something.  Like, a gymnastics chick knows how to fall from, like, a high place and jump around and all that crap.  And we know how to get punched in the face. 
[01:37:00]  You know how to prepare your body, you know, in a split second to maybe make it survive or whatever.  Right.  Because Jimmy took the kick, what was it, maybe 15, 20 percent?  No, no, no, no.  Not even.  He gave me probably a 5 percent and then a little bit.  He didn't want to hurt me because he gave me one.  He was a very soft-smoking guy.  10 percent?  Nah, maybe 10 percent on the third one.  But the third one where he put a teeny bit into it.  Like, you believed me.  He had a headache for two hours.  But he just kicked.  He kicked.  And when you look at it, it doesn't look like it hurt that much.  But it's like, I had never had a move jostling like that. 
[01:37:30]  You got like a sideways whiplash.  Yeah.  He probably could kill you if he kicked you in the head as hard as he could.  I'm sure.  And I don't want to, by the way, as we wrap up here, what's the name of the game?  And I don't want anybody to think less of me because of that noise I made.  It was more surprise than pain.  I want to hear that noise.  It's a great one.  The game's UFC personal trainer.  It's fucking embarrassing.  We can help you out with your beach physique.  And when tough guys are trying to stare at you in the subway.  Yep.  Cool. 
[01:38:00]  I can just play that tape and they can see I can take a beat.  An understanding of how to get kicked by Anderson Silva.  The UFC personal trainer would be perfect for all that stuff.  So they're begging you to put him in a scissor lock.  What is a scissor lock?  I don't know what a scissor lock is, but something squeezing.  Scissory.  Yeah.  I'm sure it would be squeezing.  That's probably fucking wrestling fans.  Could you do a figure four leg lock?  This is not fucking great Valentine.  No, I don't want a scissor lock.  You don't want a scissor lock? 
[01:38:30]  No, that really was a good one.  Here's what caught me off guard.  Because next time I see you, I don't want you to think like, oh, there's the pussy I met.  I want you to.  You'll be ready for it, right?  Next time?  But I thought he was doing something else, and I thought we were still in the explaining stage.  Oh, right, right.  I didn't realize we were in the doing stage.  That's like if you're talking to a girl, and you're like, this is only going to, and before  you say hurt, you're fucking hurt.  That's kind of what that was.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why you went, ooh.  Yeah, exactly.  Believe me, if I had an umbrella, I would have whacked you with it and said, you masher.  I really have a fucking pussy.  All right, let's get Uriah out of here. 
[01:39:00]  Thank you, brother, for coming on.  This was a pleasure, brother.  You're a great fighter.  Thanks for having me again, guys.  I really appreciate it, and I hope you all enjoy the game.  It's really a cool thing.  And it's Uriah Faber on Twitter.  He's a good one to follow, absolutely.  That's right, yeah, at Uriah Faber, and check out UriahFaber.com.  We've got all sorts of cool videos.  I'm always making spoof videos and stuff like that that are pretty fun.  Cool, man.  All right, we'll take a break.  Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar are next.  Ah!  There's a man who leads a life of danger. 
[01:39:30]  To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  With every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  Secret agent man.  Secret agent man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name. 
[01:40:00]  Beware of pretty faces that you find.  A pretty face can hide an evil mind.  I'll be careful what you say, or you'll give it all away.  Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.  Here he goes.  Secret agent man. 
[01:40:30]  Secret agent man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Is this the chorus?  Yeah.  I thought a little lead went here or something.  A little more secret agent man there, right?  Yeah, but there's another first, but I don't know when this starts. 
[01:41:00]  Hold the direction.  Hold the direction.  There's a big dumb thumb moving.  Here it comes.  Secret agent.  Secret agent man.  Secret agent man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Swinging on the Riviera one day. 
[01:41:30]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  Oh, yeah.  There's the Rescue Me music.  Nice.  Where is it?  Oh, yeah.  Do I got everyone on?  Yep.  Dennis Leary in studio.  Adam Ferrara in studio.  Yes.  Hello, fellas.  I've been a while, man.  It's been a long time.  Yeah, it has been.  Nice to be back.  When was the last time that we were on the show?  Probably the last time we had something to sell.  No. 
[01:42:00]  Dennis was on recently.  Dennis was on with the Twitter book.  Oh, right, right.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  The Twitter book that took five minutes to read.  Yep.  You're a fast reader.  It took most people 14 minutes.  14 minutes was the average time.  I'm a speed reader.  In the bathroom.  Right.  You know?  We said it, though.  It was perfect for the toilet reading, man.  It's what it was for, baby.  Very, very smart.  That's what you need on the bowl.  Just something nice, quick, funny thing to fucking read.  Have a few laughs.  You're done.  Hey, didn't I say at the time, which was true, not only can you read it while you're in the bathroom,  you can actually use the pages to wipe it.  To wipe it wet. 
[01:42:30]  It was the ultimate recycling product.  The only book printed in two-ply.  That's right.  It was three-ply, Adam.  Okay.  Right back into the environment.  Number six was the last time he was on?  Yep.  Seven months.  Holy shit.  Eight months.  This place gets here.  How are you guys doing?  What do you think?  Get the fuck out of here, Dennis.  Some old shit.  How about you get us involved with something?  We're done with this shit.  Yeah.  You're looking to executive produce another show?  Yeah.  I'd be more than happy to.  Yeah, please.  Get us out of here.  You want to do a TV show? 
[01:43:00]  I have a bunch of stuff written.  No, we really want to just continue doing radio for the next 20 years.  Get us the fuck out of here.  Actually, the idea of watching a Jim Norton TV show is right up my alley.  That would be good.  A half-hour Jim Norton show?  Thank you.  I'd love that.  Are you developing that?  He's got some things.  I have a bunch of stuff, yeah.  He's got things.  When you say a bunch of stuff, what do you mean a bunch of ideas?  No, no, no, no, no.  You have an idea.  Yeah.  So is there a way for you to work in as part of the supporting cast?  O and A? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Or are you sick of these guys?  You don't want to see them at work?  Let's say I have perhaps what I've come up with.  Perhaps the boys would be involved.  Oh, boy.  That's a no.  No, it's not.  That means it's our voice to throw a stupid radio somewhere.  Oh, no, no, no.  What did you write down here?  That's what I have.  Ah.  Is that a definite?  No.  Is that breaking news?  No, no, no.  It's only what I have in my living room.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I would watch a tranny.  I would watch the Jim Norton show every week. 
[01:44:00]  I want to play a superhero.  Like somebody who stops people with his man tits.  You have to bring up superhero.  Dennis.  That's Dennis' thing, isn't it?  What?  What?  Superhero?  Yeah, he's a superhero.  No.  I am a superhero.  Yeah, he's a superhero.  Am I?  Yes, you are.  See, Adam.  Super douche.  Yeah.  The Celtics.  Congratulations on, I don't know, almost happening.  You mean the Bruins?  Don't you mean the Bruins?  Well, the Bruins were...  I don't want to talk that because that's my sport.  That was fantastic, man.  You're still holding on the Islanders flag?  72.  72. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God.  Islanders, please.  By the way, after Al Arbor, I said, yeah, I'm going to.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no reason.  Nah, man, the Islanders are going to be all right.  What are we talking about the Islanders for?  Because that's my team.  I don't care.  We just mentioned the Boston Bruins.  We just won the Stanley Cup.  First time in history.  Three game sevens.  Four elimination games.  I mean, come on.  Let's give it up a little bit.  I do give it up to the Bruins.  We're done.  How do you react when your team wins?  Are you like...  Because I'm not a hockey fan, but if my team hadn't won an X amount...  Are you a crier?  Like, you guys get emotional when they win? 
[01:45:00]  No.  I don't cry.  Jesus.  Let me tell you something.  When those guys...  When the Miami Heat were crying, remember that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  After they lost, like, seven games in a row, and the coach said, yeah, they're in the locker  room crying.  Yeah.  Listen, I cry about a lot of stuff.  I have two kids, so, you know, I get very emotional about things that involve my kids,  but I don't cry over baseball.  I don't cry over hockey.  I don't cry over football or basketball.  How about Argentina?  I punch things.  I mean, I'll break stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't know if you guys know this, but Colin Quinn invented it, and we made it into 
[01:45:30]  an art form years ago when the Celtics were the Larry Bird Celtics.  Quinn invented the dick-out rule, which was that...  Of course.  If you guys remember the heyday, at that time, it wasn't the Chicago Bulls.  It was the Pistons who were constantly vying to knock the Celtics out before they got to  the Lakers in the finals.  So Quinn's thing was every time there was a close-up of Bill Lambert during a game on  TV, somebody in the room had to take their dick out and put it on Bill Lambert's face  on the TV screen.  And after a while, it became like a lucky totem thing. 
[01:46:00]  Like, we felt like if somebody didn't do it early in the game, we weren't going to win.  So you'd have five guys sitting around my apartment in Charlestown with their pants  already undone and their dicks out in case they cut to a close-up of Bill Lambert, which  was...  Nobody really thought about it except when my girlfriend would come home.  We'd go, what are you guys doing?  Nothing.  We're waiting for a close-up of Bill Lambert.  Could you windex the screen, too, please?  The dick prints all over the screen.  And your girlfriend bought that story?  Honey, it's all for the game.  After a while, that girlfriend is now my wife. 
[01:46:30]  And after a while, she actually...  She just accepted it as rope.  How did you let Colin convince you?  He just wanted to see your dicks.  That's why he did the same thing that he was Seinfeld.  Every time George is on screen, put your dick on him.  Well, in retrospect, that's what he was doing.  But at the time...  But anyways, I'm a crazy sports fan, but I don't cry about it.  Bill Lambert was such an asshole, too.  Yeah, but you know what?  You would have loved to have him on your team.  I agree.  Bill Lambert was such an asshole and such a brutally physical basketball player that  at the time, I wanted him on the Bruins. 
[01:47:00]  I just wanted to put some skates on him and have him go out there.  Would he fight his own guys in practice?  He was a fucking...  He was a lunatic.  He was a lunatic.  He was a fucking animal.  I hated those Pistons.  Fucking Vinnie Johnson.  They were a good team, though.  I hated them.  They were a good team.  But Dennis is right.  The wrestling hates guys like that, but you definitely want a guy like that on your team.  So let's go back to what we started talking about.  You guys are sick of this radio show.  Done.  Well, you know, we've been out doing a radio show.  How long have you been doing this?  I like doing the show.  I hate everything I go along with.  I want to Barbara Walters these guys. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  If I can get them to cry.  How many years is it?  17 years.  Okay, 17 years.  I did a few before that.  First of all, you don't feel like you want to go to 20?  No.  How long is your contract for?  What does that mean in the end?  20 years.  Who cares?  It's like a benchmark.  How long is your contract for?  Another year.  Another year.  Can I just say this very nicely and politely?  Yeah.  What the fuck else are you going to do?  Okay.  Play golf?  No, I remember when...  Enjoy my life?  After any tub in between, when I went to see you when you were living in Brooklyn? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, with the helicopters.  Radio control helicopters.  Yeah, he's building radio control helicopters.  I was being paid.  I could give a shit.  Yeah, but then he's like, listen, I got guns I could mount on here.  I went, you need a fucking job.  You need a fucking job.  Yeah, it was time to get a job.  You're trying to face Staten Island, you idiot.  You don't want to wake up every day with nothing to do.  No, but you know what it is?  How old do you now?  I kind of like...  How old do you now?  Oh, my God.  I just hit benchmark birthday.  What?  Fitty.  Really?  Well, you know, come on.  Now, let's be really brutally honest. 
[01:48:30]  I'll be generous.  I don't know you well enough.  Let's say you're going to live to 75.  Yeah, okay.  That's 25 more years, which is going to go by like this.  Oh, yeah.  20 if you keep swimming like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So really, seriously.  Six months if he keeps drinking like that.  What are you going to do?  Uh, I don't know.  I just don't...  I hate getting up this early.  Yeah, well, you know, that is not the problem.  We hate getting up early when you're shooting Rescue Me.  That's the only part of the job.  But that's the part of the...  Yeah, but that's the only part of the job. 
[01:49:00]  It's like saying I hate batting practice if you're a baseball player.  It's part of the gig.  Yeah.  How many months do you get up early for Rescue Me, though?  That's different.  Every month?  For three months?  Monday through Wednesday, you have to...  I mean, on any movie or television show, Monday through Wednesday, if you're not shooting  nights, you're up at 4.30.  Right.  You've got to be on the set ready to block at 6 o'clock, right?  That's crazy.  Then by...  If you're doing nights, you're working like a vampire.  Mm-hmm.  But, yeah.  I mean, any movie, any time.  But they have downtime in between the seasons and the movies.  You have downtime, right?  You have downtime.  The downtime on Rescue Me was about two months. 
[01:49:30]  That was it?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck, man.  You guys are working hard.  There's no easy gig in show business, man.  And then you say, well, I want to do a talk show.  That's the hardest gig in show business, is hosting a talk show every day on television.  Yeah.  It's like this.  You've got to do five hours or four hours of work, then do the thing, and it disappears  into the ether.  And then do it again tomorrow, bastard.  I'll tell you what you guys should do.  Be funny tomorrow.  All right.  Here we go.  You should help the poor and the sick.  Now, listen to me.  Hear me out.  Hear me out.  Because it sounds really cool, and it sounds like you're going to go to heaven, but you don't 
[01:50:00]  really have to do shit.  Really?  Because if you say right now, I'm going to spend the rest of my life helping the poor  and the sick, nobody fucking cares what time you get up.  You could say, and you could disappear for six months and go, what have you been doing?  Helping the poor and the sick.  Yeah.  Perfect.  I was in Ghana for the last six months.  From noon?  You wake up at noon?  I don't want attention.  I don't want to draw attention to myself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm doing it.  It's not about me.  It's not about me.  No.  It's about the poor and the sick.  And the sick.  And by the way, you send a little check in.  I kind of like that.  Nobody can deny that you helped.  Yeah, every so often. 
[01:50:30]  I send a check to the Ghana Relief Fund.  And then you wake up.  I'm good for a while.  10, 30, 11, noon, whatever.  Get up whatever time you want.  I like that.  Hey, is Adam married yet?  Damn.  No.  How am I, big fella?  Weren't you engaged?  Still am.  My father.  Actually, you can see this ring?  You know.  My father.  My pop died.  Yeah.  And he says, I'm not going to make it to the wedding.  Because he knew he wasn't going to make it.  Oh, Jesus.  So he leans over.  Wait.  That's not because he's sick.  It's because he knew his son.  He knew it was going to take 15 years for his son to get married.  Yeah.  My pop leans over and goes, you love her. 
[01:51:00]  You love him.  He's tapping on the head.  He goes, you're married.  This is the ring your mother gave to me.  I'm going to give it to you.  I just saved you 40 grand.  And so, is she buying into that?  That's just like Joe.  We'll make it official eventually after we finish the house.  Here's the way I look at it.  I'm going to send out, rather than sending out an invitation, I'm sending out an explanation.  Yeah.  It's going to look like a wedding invitation.  Like, we love each other.  We want to get married.  But why should you be inconvenienced?  We're not going to fuck up a three-day weekend.  Yeah.  Make you fly somewhere.  Here's a picture of the blender we like.  Come on over to the house.  She hates him.  I saw her backstage at the first gig the other night. 
[01:51:30]  I mean, she loves him, but she hates him.  It's like all of us who know Adam.  We like him.  We love him.  We hate him.  She's had enough of your bullshit.  Oh, my God.  Has she had it?  Has she had it?  I don't think she laughed once at one of the bits the other night.  We were watching her, and we're going, you know, she's not laughing at the bits anymore.  That's because she's sleeping with him.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happens with Adam.  Well, when they're all about her and how horrible girlfriends are in relationships.  No, no, no.  I didn't do any of that.  What did I do?  Did the NASCAR?  I did stuff about NASCAR and cars. 
[01:52:00]  That's how the girls love those.  Does it bother you that your boyish exuberance makes her want to behead you now?  She loved you at one point.  You know what started out as cute is now annoying.  He used to do this bit last year on the tour.  And, you know, the thing, I don't know if you've seen the bit about how big her hands are.  You know how to buy the ring?  You know that bit?  Yeah.  She's got giant hands.  The first night he did that bit, we were backstage, a bunch of us watching him work.  And she was standing, like, about a foot away watching him work.  And he went into the, she's got giant hands, which is a really funny bit. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Right?  About the kids swimming, you know, in the pool and only going in one direction because of the giant hands.  Anyways, he's doing the bit, and we're all afraid to laugh.  It was me and Lenny Clark and the band.  There was, like, seven guys there.  And we looked at her, and she literally just held up her left hand to show us how big it was.  And then put it back without looking at us.  We were like, wow.  She cuts her to the chase.  She's angry.  Yeah.  Angry birds.  Angry birds.  She's not happy with Adam.  Cut right to the chase.  Here's my fucking hand.  You're all wrong.  She loves me. 
[01:53:00]  What's the tour about?  You guys are doing the, uh...  We're only doing five dates because I have to go back.  I have to go all around the America to tour.  Helping the poor.  To help the poor.  To help the poor.  And make sure everybody watches the finale of Rescue Me.  And so it's the briefest tour we've done, but it's the last Rescue Me comedy tour.  This is the last chance to see us because I don't know if we'll get this group of guys together when the show ends in September.  What was the reasoning?  Did you decide, like, that was enough?  First of all, seven years, which is a longer ride than we ever thought we'd get. 
[01:53:30]  I think seven years is when any television show should end.  I can't.  It'd be hard.  Maybe Seinfeld.  Yeah.  Like the eighth and ninth season.  And so it might be easier with a half hour to go longer, but I think seven years is a long enough time.  And it's also the 10th anniversary of 9-11.  The show was built around the idea of recovering from 9-11.  So it just seemed perfect.  Nice.  And we feel like we're still hopefully getting out before everybody's had enough of it.  Before it turns into Archie Bunker's place.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That was one of my favorite shows of all time. 
[01:54:00]  All the family was great.  And by the time...  Let me tell you when that show jumped the shot.  When Edith got raped.  Sorry.  Done.  That was enough.  Yeah.  It's like, what are you doing?  When it got to the point where Archie was in the bar, because it was Archie Bunker's place,  and he's going like, hey, we ought to have some tolerance there.  Yeah.  It's like, really?  Really?  That's the odd character?  Is that it?  I don't want to see that.  The guy has been on television so long that now you're trying to make him not a racist.  Yeah, not a racist guy.  And that was the beautiful thing about Archie Bunker, was that he was totally racist and  hated everybody, but it always blew up in his face. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  You know?  It was the perfect show.  It was a great show.  And they wrecked it.  Yeah, I guess seven years is enough.  Seven years is enough.  Well, did Jean Stapleton want to leave?  She did.  I'm sure they didn't write her out.  First Mike and Gloria left, and then she left, and then he's by himself.  Listen, the guy was a great actor.  Stephanie was funny, though.  When she came on...  No, you're out of your mind.  No, she made the show.  You're out of your mind.  She was better.  Jimmy's being a smartass.  She was very good.  She was very good.  What are you writing down? 
[01:55:00]  Why don't you just say it, Adam?  What's wrong with you?  Oh, very cryptic.  There's something going on.  Oh, they're fighting.  The guy's writing me notes.  Like, I need to read more notes in my life.  I didn't know if you could bring it up.  I thought it was pretty cool if we can.  Your uniform.  No, I can't.  We're not allowed to talk about that.  Oh, now we know there's a uniform thing.  Oh, so that's why I wrote you a note.  Yeah, I know.  But now we know...  Commercials?  Go to a commercial so you can...  Now we know there's a uniform thing.  Now we know there's a uniform thing, Adam.  Yeah, we can't talk about it on the air.  They asked us not to.  They want to surprise people.  Okay, fine.  I was going to say one other thing, though, 
[01:55:30]  when we were talking.  I also have about nine episodes.  Wow, you just threw Dennis off.  It's not easy to throw Dennis off.  I got Alzheimer's now, so...  Well, Stephanie...  Terrible.  Which was Stephanie from All in the Family.  And tolerance.  Yes.  Her and Cousin All in the Great Show.  This show is so disorganized.  I'm really...  I just am offended by your lack of preparation.  Lack of preparation.  Lack of keeping things on track.  I know.  You're right.  Aren't you supposed to be in charge of that?  Supposed to be.  Tell Adam to stop writing your notes.  No, Adam was right.  That was a good question. 
[01:56:00]  What are you pulling out now?  What are you looking at?  I don't know.  The Rescue Me book?  I really don't know.  I think it's just for the media.  I thought...  He's so bored.  He reaches over and grabs a book.  No, this is...  I understand now.  I didn't know what you were saying.  I'm not even sure if we're supposed to promote it, because I don't think anyone...  Just anyone could get that.  No, that's a press book.  That's...  It's a really nice press book.  I know.  I know.  It's nicer than your Twitter book.  Oh, shit.  You motherfucker.  You filthy, dirty rat.  Motherfucker.  Yeah, my book was two-ply.  That's three-ply.  You son of a bitch. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  You took your shot at us.  It is actually nicer.  It's actually nicer.  It's along with that book.  It is nicer.  It's really nice.  You know, that's going to be a collector's item, because it wasn't sold in stores.  Yeah.  Fuck.  All right.  You know?  I'm trying to think of where I can get it signed.  Look at Adam.  Look at Adam.  Look at you.  Look at that.  Look at Adam.  Wow.  Adam Ferrara.  Look at all nice.  Gruff.  You look gruff in that one.  I'm gruff.  Hey, you know, if you play your cards right, and you're nice to Jim Norton, maybe he'll put  you on the Jim Norton shot.  I'm always nice to Jim Norton.  I've always been nice to Jim Norton.  Well, you saw a head when you first met Jim.  I knew.  I said, listen.  A talented kid.  How long can I ride this Irish kid? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  So after this runs out, you're jumping from Dennis to Jimmy.  My acting is stellar.  Adam will be just fine.  He's the only one that got a show about cars, and he knows nothing about cars.  How can you say that after the brakes we fixed on the car and all the...  Using his father's chamois to fucking clean oil off of dipsticks.  We did the...  I think I sent you the picture of us in the trophy trucks.  My good chamois.  That picture I sent you, me and the trophy trucks, and we drummed the trophy trucks.  So the guy's taking us around the trophy trucks, and these little Mazda engines in these trucks, 
[01:57:30]  and he's explaining how the suspension works, and he's going into detail.  I went, I have no idea what that lead is.  No, it's not.  You don't need to know.  No, I don't.  I get in and I drive.  Just let me start it up.  I'm gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I drove the Caddy last year, and they go, dude, how did you know what speed to go?  I said, I...  Just hit the gas.  I just hit it.  I just landed.  What do you really need to know?  That is true.  You just step on the gas pedal, and it's a skinny one on the right.  If it stops, that's it.  And then you've got to know where you live. 
[01:58:00]  If it stops, it's the wrong pedal.  Yeah.  Right?  That's basically it.  The best thing that helped me...  Where you live and where you work.  That's all you need to know.  The best thing that helped me was GPS, because I have Amelia Earhart sensor direction.  Oh, you have always been the worst.  Really?  Where am I?  I have no idea.  And this was Proust's cell phone.  Can I say something else?  This is a private thing that I just realized that we can make public.  Go ahead.  And it's one of those things you cannot fix.  Okay.  What?  It's like when a guy goes out and picks up his first baseball and throws.  He's either lefty or righty.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  Right?  You can teach him to bat from both sides of the plate, but it's a natural thing. 
[01:58:30]  I have never been...  I've never driven in a car with Adam, where I wasn't driving where Adam was driving.  Yes, you have.  Hang on a second.  Let me tell the story, cocksucker.  We're a couple...  I think the first Rescue Me Comedy tour.  You know, and this is like...  I've known Adam for years.  You know what I mean?  I consider him not just a good friend, but like really kind of a guy that's always going  to be my friend, right?  So I haven't...  Adam is not driven with me in the car.  So we're doing Philly, and I forget what the next date was, but Adam and I had to split  literally like do a Beatles thing. 
[01:59:00]  Come off the stage.  Go into the alleyway, get in the truck, and drive back to New York.  I think we were doing a Rescue Me premiere the next day, and we had to be on the radio  and stuff.  So we literally...  I wrap it up.  We sing the asshole song.  Bring everybody back out.  You know, good night, everybody.  Walk off stage.  We each grab the sandwich from the backstage food.  We get in...  I think it was your truck.  We rented a truck, I think.  Yeah.  And we drive out, right?  Now, you know, in the streets of Philly, and now we're on the highway, right?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, Adam's talking to me, and I realize Adam is one of those guys that's 
[01:59:30]  driving 90 miles an hour, which is fine, because that's how fast I drive.  Yeah.  While he's...  If he's talking to me, he has to look at me.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the looking guy.  So I'm eating a sandwich, and he's literally...  He's like 90 miles an hour in a fast lane, and when he's talking to me, he's looking at  me.  Dennis.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm going...  I'm one of those guys that never take my eyes off the road, and I'm going, hey, pal,  watch the road.  He goes, I got it.  Don't worry about me and the road and everything.  It was unbelievable.  That is the frightening thing where people will look at you.  I don't mind going fast.  What the fuck are you looking at me for? 
[02:00:00]  I'm right here.  What do you need to see?  Yeah.  I'll tell you what the expression is on my face if you feel like you can't read it from  my words.  Keep your eyes on the road.  You know?  I'm like Adam.  Yeah, you do?  I have to look.  Not me, man.  I don't look.  It drives my wife nuts.  She's like, stop looking.  You could take your pants off and start jerking off in the shotgun seat.  I'll see it out of the corner of my eye, but I do not need to look at you while  you're doing it.  You've got the good peripheral.  Yeah.  It's important we get there alive.  I don't care what you do in the shotgun seat.  It was just the highway.  We had a police escort to the highway, so all the turns were already done. 
[02:00:30]  No, no, no.  It was straight.  We've had that.  So they could clean you up.  Let's not have a discussion about it.  Okay, fine.  You want me to write you another note?  We've had the police escort.  Philly's good that way.  Yeah, they really good.  How great is that?  That's great.  Yeah.  They had to go full sirens at five in the morning to get us to do morning radio.  Unless they put you in the back seat of the patrol cars that are just those they  could hose off the puke seats.  Yeah, yeah.  Where they're plastic.  With no leg room.  And you're sliding back and forth because the cops are smart ass around the corners.  I've had that one. 
[02:01:00]  They have their own rules down there.  Yeah.  Philly's really cool.  Philly fucking rocks.  That's where I sent you that picture, I think.  What picture?  It was really cool of your name and the Rolling Stones on the same.  You're the one who sent me that?  Yeah.  Thank you, Adam.  You're the one that came in.  That's pretty cool.  I did a gig the week after the Stones.  Why is everyone being so fucking nice to each other this morning?  Yeah, I know.  This is really pleasant.  I know.  We're nice people.  I think that we're just nice people.  Yeah, you're the asshole.  We're angry masks.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just me.  Yeah, you're the asshole. 
[02:01:30]  We're nice people, Dennis.  Yeah, okay.  That's a pretty cool thing, your name and the Rolling Stones, man.  Yeah.  That's what you're doing.  Although they're saying it was the Tyler Theater.  I'm sure they're real happy about it.  They were.  Mick actually asked me for a copy.  Did he?  Go fuck yourself.  Get your own copy.  Yeah, get your own copy.  Call Adam.  He might have another one.  But they said Rolling Stones sold out and then Jim Norton.  I wasn't sold out.  But that really bothered me.  I wished it would have.  No, my favorite was in the bathroom there at the Paul McCartney show when Ron Wood and  Keith Richards. 
[02:02:00]  I was just getting up to take a piss.  Right.  And when I walked in the bathroom, I noticed Ron Wood and Keith Richards walk in.  Yeah.  I'm like, there's no one else in the bathroom.  I'm like, wow, this is pretty cool.  Yeah.  Pissing with the Stones.  And like a Kramer entrance, Jimmy comes through the door.  Because I guess he saw them get up.  No, I followed Keith down.  I didn't know that Ron was there.  I knew Keith was there.  I'd already got a picture with him.  But I followed Keith down to get another picture with him.  Yeah.  Why did you have to have another picture with him? 
[02:02:30]  Keith Richards.  Not Keith the cop.  Keith Richards.  But you're not satisfied with the one picture with Keith Richards.  You want to go for the second picture.  No, you have no idea.  A man who carries a knife in his boot and you want to get a second picture in the men's  room.  Yeah, he does.  No, I had a good one.  I snapped it of us as he was walking in.  I got him and Ron Wood that way.  Did he know that the picture was being taken?  Oh, yeah.  I said, Keith, have a picture?  And then he was like, excuse me, sir.  Excuse me, sir.  I was like, shut up.  Fucking publicist twat.  And I fucking held the camera out.  I was like, keep it in there.  Fucking got it.  Let's just take that moment in time.  Fucking publicist twat. 
[02:03:00]  One of the stones, madam.  Yeah, you mean nothing to me right now.  Shut up.  Yeah, I don't care what you say.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a publicist twat.  I work for Jim Norton.  On the new Jim Norton show.  I can't believe you actually thought, I need a second picture of Keith Richards.  Well, he's going to show you the picture now.  I don't know if I have it with me.  But, Anthony, tell me what happened because I saw Anthony in the bathroom.  Oh, yeah, the urinal.  Well, he sucked my dick.  And then he took a picture.  Long story short.  Yeah, long story short.  It's a good shot. 
[02:03:30]  It's a nice shot of me.  Awesome.  It is cool.  Look at that.  It's a cool shot.  I love Keith.  Did you read the book?  No, I haven't, but I've not read it.  What are you, crazy?  How could you not read the book?  I'm going to erase this picture from your phone right now.  You're not a real Keith Richards fan.  Erase it.  You're out of your mind.  You're not a Stones fan?  I'm a Stones fan.  I'm a hacky Stones fan in the way I'm a hacky Beatles fan.  I love a lot of the things that everybody else loves, but I'm not a Sabbath fan.  I'm a Sabbath fanatic.  I'm not a Stones fan.  I am erasing this picture from your phone.  What?  You goddamn son of a bitch.  You don't like the Rolling Stones enough to be a true Rolling Stones fan, and you're chasing 
[02:04:00]  Keith Richards for a second picture into the men's room?  I would ask fucking Casey Anthony for a picture if she walked in the room.  I fucking love As Tears Go By on the Ed Sullivan Show.  That's not bad.  That's a little deeper.  Yeah.  I don't just like it.  There's a great under my thumb from the fucking 60s I like.  It's a little better than Satisfaction.  It's my favorite rock group of all time.  Stones?  Are they?  Yeah.  What's your favorite song?  I could not pick a favorite song.  How about a quick top five list?  Can I just tell you one thing?  I'll tell you one thing right now.  Yeah.  I'll tell you a lot of things, but I'll tell you one thing right now. 
[02:04:30]  In a second.  You dirty...  In the fucking men's room.  Okay.  All right.  I got it.  I got it.  Yeah.  Me and the boys in the men's room.  Oh, yeah.  Do you take pictures like that, Dennis?  No, I don't do that shit.  Did you use that?  Come on.  Have you ever?  No, I have people...  I'm one of those guys that people come in the men's room and try to take a picture of me.  No, we understand how big you are, but...  I don't like to bother those guys.  Plus, I'm such a huge Stones fan.  I wouldn't know which Stone to pick first, because I...  You know what I mean?  Who do you have that you regret not taking a picture?  I don't...  I met Pryor once, and I got an autograph, but I didn't get a picture.  And Kinnison.  And I'm like, I got signatures, but I'm like, I wish I would have done pictures back then, 
[02:05:00]  because that would be a cool photo to have.  I did.  I actually...  This is like one of my biggest things.  See, this is the kind of shit that means more to me than the picture.  Yeah.  Is Pryor asked me to read his autobiography and to give him a quote for the back.  Oh, wow.  And that was like...  Yeah, that's a big one.  Because that was my comedy hero, and you know.  Yeah.  So that...  But no, I'm not a big picture guy.  How cool was it when you walked back and Keith Richards was playing the asshole song?  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  What?  Yeah, I was doing...  It's a long story short. 
[02:05:30]  And the Voodoo Lounge tour.  Very long.  Ted Demme and I got hired by the Stones.  We were going to make a film of that tour, which was very long, convoluted.  We had to follow them around for ages on the tour, and we had to travel with them.  So you got to know all of them.  Yeah, I got to know Mick more than most of the guys, because he's the business guy.  But anyways, the first day that we were there, it was a long, involved process of them trying  to figure out what they wanted to do, and us having to hang around.  Which, by the way, having to hang around with the Stones, one of the greatest three weeks 
[02:06:00]  of my life.  But anyway, long story short, the first night, I'm with Mick.  He's warming up his voice, and he goes, will you go...  I don't know what Keith wants to talk about, but he wants to talk about some stuff before  the show tonight, because when we go to the after party, you know, it's not a great time  to talk business.  And I'm like, but before the gig is?  So anyways, we go back to the dressing room, we walk in, and Keith and...  As I open the door there, and I'm thinking it's just a practical joke.  They're playing the asshole song.  And I thought it was set up by Mick, but actually, Keith, at the after party after that gig, 
[02:06:30]  they sat down with me and Chris Phillips, and we're like, man, how did you guys come  up with the asshole song?  And I'm telling you, I couldn't talk.  Chris goes, well, one night in my apartment.  This is Ron Wood and Keith Richards asking us how we wrote the asshole song.  Yeah, yeah.  Wake up, dude.  You know?  And realize what's going on here.  Maybe I should ask you about a few songs you wrote.  And we all know this to be true, but one thing, when you watch those guys do rehearsal  and sound check every day over and over again, like any of those bands, the fucking guys 
[02:07:00]  are so good at what they do.  And just, I mean, there's a reason they're one of the top rock bands, if not the one in  the history of rock and roll.  They're fucking great.  They're fantastic.  Do you have a picture with the band, as a band?  Did you have to get a long shot?  No.  You didn't?  I have pictures because I did, I went up on stage and introduced them one night.  You know, all that crap.  So I've got all those professional photographer pictures.  Like in the old days, though.  I don't want to ask them to sign stuff and all that. 
[02:07:30]  I don't do that.  I do that with the sports guys.  Oh, you do.  Like in MTV days, you know, before you made it, you had to have been like starstruck with  some of these people.  My greatest funny starstruck early career story, I just told it to him in the dressing room.  Mark Goodman.  Hey, we had Nina Blackwood on.  Oh, boy.  Nina Blackwood.  She was amazing.  How's she doing?  She's out of her fucking mind.  Very nice.  She's nuts.  Why are we being nice?  Well, I don't think she was necessarily wired correctly back in the day. 
[02:08:00]  She's living in Maine in a tiny, tiny little town in the middle of nowhere.  Why?  She likes Maine.  She wanted to get out of the hustle and bustle.  She wanted to get the fuck out of L.A.  Wow.  So she picked this tiny town in Maine.  That's as far from L.A. as you can get in America.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  And her mailman's a huge fan of our show, I guess.  What was his name?  See, there you go.  Stephen Tiny.  Hi, Tiny.  Stephen Tiny.  Fucking Frank the Rampist.  Yeah, Tiny's listening right now.  One more reason for you guys to stay on the radio.  For Tiny.  Stephen Tiny doesn't snap and kill Nina Blackwood in the woods in Maine. 
[02:08:30]  So what was the story?  Yeah.  You were early on, or who'd you meet?  That you got starstruck.  Yeah, you had a story, and then he said Mark Goodman.  You said it was a, you just told Adam in the dressing room.  Just told him in the dressing room.  Dressie room.  The Clapton one?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Clapton.  You have a Clapton story?  I have a Clapton story.  So we're at the, this is, it's kind of a Clapton story.  Well, I'm at the MTV Awards the first time I do it, which is probably 92 or something,  93, and I'm doing, I'm presenting with Cindy Crawford, but my band is also playing the  Asshole song, which was like, you know, a big hit at the time.  So Chris Phillips from the band is with me, and we're backstage. 
[02:09:00]  They have a big green room, which is where everybody hangs out before you go up to do your  thing on stage.  That was when Tears from Heaven got Eric Clapton, right?  So we're backstage.  I mean, literally, that room is jam-packed.  Magic Johnson, Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, every giant rock person you can think of, and show  business person is in this room.  Jean-Claude Van Damme.  I mean, everybody, right?  So, Ernest.  I have a great Van Damme story.  I have a great Van Damme story, I just realized from that time.  Come on.  Did Magic Johnson have like half the room to himself? 
[02:09:30]  Everybody's crammed on one side.  Because they still didn't really understand it yet.  Yeah, they still did not understand it.  Turn it off.  So anyways, we're sitting there, and Eric Clapton comes over to tell me and Chris that  he is a big fan.  He saw no cancer, and he loved the assholes.  Wow.  So that's pretty big, right?  Now, all through that night, the only asshole people in that green room, Kurt Cobain and Courtney  Love, and not so much the other guys, but Kurt Cobain has security guards.  He won't talk to anybody. 
[02:10:00]  It's literally, everybody's going like, who the fuck does this guy think he is?  You've got every giant rock star in the world in this room, right?  He's a total asshole backstage.  Probably high on heroin.  Anyways, this is the night they go on stage, and at the end of the song, he throws the  bass up, and it comes down and hits him in the face.  Now, if you remember, we're in the green room.  We're watching the live feed, right?  It hits him in the face.  They cut the commercial.  I mean, literally, it was so quick that people were sitting there going, did that guitar just  hit him in the face?  Two seconds later, walking through the green room with a thing of ice on his face, he's 
[02:10:30]  bleeding, and two medical people lead him through the room, and Eric Clapton and all  the rock stars start laughing their asses up.  That was the, and that was when I went like, wow, talk about payback, you know?  Who got hit in the face?  Cobain did?  No, Chris Novosel.  Chris Novosel.  Yeah, it was pretty awesome.  Oh, man.  That was also the night, they had, we had an extra chair at our table, and Jean-Claude  Van Damme walks in, and he's got like 90 people with him, right?  And he comes over to our table, and we had this one extra chair, and he goes, excuse 
[02:11:00]  me, is this chair busy?  And Chris Phillips goes, no, if it was plaid, it would be busy.  And everybody laughs, right?  Eric Clapton, Cindy Crawford, Jean-Claude Van Damme doesn't get the joke, and he gets  ripshit.  He's staring at Chris.  Chris goes, good, you can take the chair.  He just didn't get it.  Yeah, he didn't get the joke.  That's great.  I love Jean-Claude Van Damme.  I really miss him.  Those movies were him and Steven Seagalman, those were my favorite.  Those were the funniest comedy action movies of all time.  Yeah.  When he played the twins, Van Damme, he was the good guy and the bad guy. 
[02:11:30]  What was the name of that one?  Double something.  Oh, that sounds horrible.  And Seagal, man.  Seagal was the best.  Yeah.  By the time he was fat and he had the giant Indian jacket on, he was saving the, Michael  Caine was the old baron up in Alaska.  Remember that one?  Oh, my God.  With his ponytail.  And he was, yeah, he was fat.  He was 400 pounds.  He had to wear that long leather.  It was awesome.  Did you guys hear his blues album?  No.  Oh, come on.  He's got a blues album?  He's got a blues album. 
[02:12:00]  We put it out like five years ago.  I've hit it.  We did, actually.  I think we might have.  I think you're right.  We did play some of that.  I think we tracked through it and really just had fun with it.  Yeah, I think we did destroy that guy blues album.  I loved it.  Is he a good singer?  He's all right.  I really wanted to make an action singer about a giant 400 pound ponytail blues slash karate  guy.  We can't really get this put up anymore.  I think it'd be awesome.  He was kind of a sheriff.  Yeah, he was kind of a sheriff.  So what would the title of that movie be?  Douchebag. 
[02:12:30]  You can try karate chopping a salad, you fat bastard.  Did we do Rescue Me Justice?  I mean, what are we going to see?  I want to ask Dennis a question about Rescue Me?  What about Rescue Me?  What do you want to say?  Final season starts next week.  Nine episodes.  The last two episodes are extra fat because it's a double finale.  Right.  And I hope everybody likes the ending.  It's too late for us to change it.  Sure.  It's not going to be some fucking journey song, is it?  No, we don't go to black.  No.  It's Rush.  All right.  All right.  No, it's...  It depends on which Rush song. 
[02:13:00]  It goes to black.  Don't do Roll the Bones.  YYZ and fade to black.  Yeah, a little YYZ would roll.  Rolls it to the heart.  Why such a love of firemen?  Somebody in your family, maybe you've told a story, I don't know, but you do the Comics  Come Home.  It's a heavy story, bro.  It's for firemen.  No, it's not.  Comics Come Home is for the Cam Neely Cancer Foundation.  But you've done other charity stuff for firemen, right?  Yes.  Okay.  My cousin, Jerry Lucy, was a firefighter in Worcester, Mass.  It was his lifelong dream growing up. 
[02:13:30]  And he actually became a fireman in our old neighborhood, as did another kid from our neighborhood,  Tommy Spencer.  And they both perished in a fire.  It was kind of a famous fire at the time in Worcester, Mass.  December 3rd, 99, the cold storage warehouse fire.  Six firemen were killed.  My cousin, Jerry, and his partner went in with, you know, about 250 other firemen to clear  out this warehouse because they thought there were...  They knew there were homeless people in there.  And then Jerry and his partner got stuck and Tommy Spencer, who, I mean, how to describe 
[02:14:00]  the bravery of any of these guys, but Tommy Spencer and three other guys went back in  to look for him and the building blew up.  But anyways, that's where it started to help.  Because firefighters, I've said it a million times, but it bears saying it again, you know,  they never go on strike.  So when somebody like Mayor Bloomberg wants to cut the budget in any city, any mayor, they  cut firemen first because there's not going to be a strike.  Why won't there be?  They're not allowed to or they just don't do it? 
[02:14:30]  They just, they won't do it.  They care too much about what they do.  So that's, it's the easiest group of people to say, yeah, we're cutting, we're taking  20 firehouses away, whatever.  So anyways, any given urban fire department needs help.  So my aim was to raise money, not just to help the families left behind, but to actually  go to the guys in individual fire departments, Worcester, Boston, New York, and say, if we gave  you guys a quarter of a million or whatever it is, what would you want us to buy or build?  Um, cause I, listen, I've said it a million times again, I'll say it again. 
[02:15:00]  If there was a fire in this building right now, um, you know, these guys would come in  and get us.  Now I think if you have kids, I do, I can easily imagine trying to run into a building  to save my kids if they were in there.  But we're, so we're talking about guys that literally will come in to save us.  They don't know us.  Yeah.  They do it for strangers.  People who know us, I can't believe we'd come in and get us.  You know what I mean?  I just think they're the, I think they're the greatest, you know?  I don't understand what motivate, like the, the fucking balls it takes to do that. 
[02:15:30]  It's astonishing.  And it's amazing that these stupid cities would cut, there's nothing more important  than putting a fire out.  I know.  When there's a fire, there's nothing more important than...  There's no levels of redundant management with the transit.  Why would you just leave them there?  I know.  It's really, I mean, it's ridiculous.  The guys are serving the military, you know, in defense of this country.  We all love and admire it.  Obviously that, that in itself is, is an amazing thing.  But I put firemen right in that same category.  And a lot of these guys, especially in FDNY, a lot of these guys have, have been, have worked 
[02:16:00]  as firemen and gone and served in Iraq and come back in Afghanistan and come back home  again.  They're not like us.  I mean, that's what Rescue Me was about, really, was about how the, what these guys  are like and how they try to recover from a huge event, a huge tragic event.  But just on a day-to-day basis, I don't care who he is or who she is.  If they're working as a firefighter in any, you know, circumstance, I automatically just  go, hey, hats off, man.  Yeah.  Because it's, it's balls of steel. 
[02:16:30]  The only, that's the one.  It's balls of steel.  There's no other way to describe it, man.  I don't give a shit how well or how poorly they may have done it today.  It's just the fact that you're doing it to me is, I just can't get, I can't wrap my  mind around it.  Chicks love to fuck firemen.  That's one thing.  Oh, you see that in Rescue Me.  Payback, actually, that's the, that's the, that's the name of my next book.  Chicks love to fuck firemen.  Because there's, there is that brave and protect thing that, that's an instinct thing. 
[02:17:00]  Women fucking love it.  Of all the professions, I think they voted that the sexiest profession.  Yeah.  Where comedian was right above child rapist.  Yeah.  On the sexy fucking profession.  I love the sexy humor in a man.  Below, actually.  Yeah.  Actually below.  Yeah.  I've saved the burning building.  Knock, knock.  Exactly.  Which one are you going to fuck?  Yeah.  Adam, how many seasons have you done now?  I came on the end of three.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Was it really the end of three?  End of three.  So I did four or five.  Jesus Christ.  Listen, I'm not, I'm not here to blow smoke up his ass.  I got to tell you, we brought him in out of the blue because we, this, we had this character 
[02:17:30]  in our back pocket and we were like, we're going to write this guy at the way every guy  on Rescue Me is like, he's going to do comedy.  He's going to do drama.  He came in his first day and it was like a pretty big giant scene, giant monologue thing with  Tommy Gavin.  Right.  And we were like, listen, you can, you know, we have an easy day today, kind of.  So you can, you can take as many stabs at it as you want.  And he came in, he nailed it on the first one and we were all looking at each other like,  Jesus.  Holy shit.  He was kind of a go-to guy, man.  He was gold. 
[02:18:00]  He was gold.  It was a blast.  Look at that there.  That's the thing.  That's what I'm going to miss.  Mr. Faber-sham.  It's like working with the guys.  Well, it's worth, it's like when you go to another show and everything and they're not used,  cause we'll see like the guest stars that show up and it's an entirely different show.  And like, we'll be fucking around and all of a sudden we do the scene.  And was it Jerry?  When we...  From the Sopranos, Jerry Adler.  When he came to rescue me, his first day, he was like, this, this is crazy.  Cause you know, people improv, we do a lot.  And the guy, especially the firehouse guys, when, when you had a scene and you might say 
[02:18:30]  like, listen, you guys, that middle section there isn't that good.  So just play around with it.  You know, they turn the cameras on.  You got three cameras running.  You got eight guys in the scene.  Yeah.  Adler's first day, we, we did the first two takes and people were just improvising in it.  Right.  And he was looking at us.  He just come from like seven years on the Sopranos and he went, what the hell is going  on?  What kind of show is he?  Why do you bother writing it?  Yeah, I know.  He had his pages and he, we were like, no, forget the pages.  Just get, get his, get his character and be ready for anything. 
[02:19:00]  I highlighted my stuff.  Yeah.  Who was he on the Sopranos?  He was, uh, uh, hash.  He was great.  He's a great actor, man.  He was so good.  That was funny.  I tell you, on Rescue Me, man, he, he became gold as well.  And that speech we got on 9-11.  He's, you've got a great storyline with him this final season.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is great.  That ended.  Some great scenes with, uh, with, uh, Jerry Adler.  Did it get emotional when the whole thing was ending?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did.  Um, you guys all just get really sad and shit.  Well, yeah.  Also, the storyline that happens in the course of the last season without giving anything 
[02:19:30]  away is incredibly.  Yeah, you gotta know.  It's incredibly emotional.  The way the show came in.  So the storyline's emotional and then you know it's your final season.  Yeah, it was really.  That's gotta be brutal.  There's some really heavy stuff that goes on.  Plus, like, I know I'm gonna see Adam and I know I'm gonna see Scurdy and Lenny.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like, these guys, and I'm gonna write more parts for them and hopefully they're gonna  write, like, we're just gonna lock that together for the rest of our lives.  Right.  But, you know, there's a big chunk of that cast.  We'll never see again, really.  Well, I don't know if we will, because, like, already, Sinjata is in Batman and he's on Grey's 
[02:20:00]  Anatomy.  Steven Pasquale is shooting a pilot for USA.  Callie Thorne has her own series on USA.  I mean, they're good actors.  You know, I know Scurdy has turned stuff down.  You know what I mean?  Like, they're gonna get gobbled up.  So that was the worst part, is going like, damn, they were so good, these guys and these  chicks.  And that's a once in a lifetime sometimes.  You know what I mean?  So that's what I miss, is just going like, wow, that guy hit a grand slam.  Now I gotta run around the bases, too.  How's our pal Lenny doing?  We love him.  Great.  He's on Chelsea Handler's new sitcom. 
[02:20:30]  We haven't seen Lenny Clark in a while, man.  He looks different.  I know.  I know.  Every time we see him, he's different.  I gotta tell you, man, he is really funny on that show.  I saw the pilot that they picked up.  He's just funny.  Him and Chelsea, he plays the dad.  She plays her older sister.  Wait, she's gonna have another show.  So it's not on NBC, right?  Yeah, it's an NBC show.  She's got the talk show.  She's got the after talk show.  Now this is based on her first book.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  And Lenny's in it.  Oh, I didn't even know that.  He's the dad. 
[02:21:00]  He plays her father.  Oh, that's gotta be great.  So if you know her books, and you know what her stories about her dad are like, Lenny's  playing that guy.  Oh, perfect.  It's pretty funny.  Good for Lenny.  Lenny's funny.  Yeah.  He lost a shitload of...  Well, you saw him up there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's in shape.  He's not just lost weight.  Lenny's in shape.  Yeah, he's in fighting shape.  That is odd, man.  See, that's what I need.  He was a huge guy.  Yeah.  I mean, he lost it a few times, right?  Didn't he get back a couple times?  Yeah.  And then it would come back.  He was really big.  We were doing the job.  He was really big, and he had a...  I liked that job, by the way.  That was a great show. 
[02:21:30]  I really did like that show, as well.  He had a kidney stone where he had to keep shooting, so he gave him the medicine, and  he's close to 300 pounds, and we're walking down...  Thank you.  We're walking down the stairs.  He's all doped up, walking down the stairs to go see Otto and George at Caroline.  Do you know the stairs at Caroline?  And the pill kicked in, and he starts...  Oh, God.  And I got to keep him...  It's like walking a drugged rhino.  Oh, shit.  The stairs.  It was worse.  He's a big boy.  But now he's like 160 pounds, 170 pounds.  What? 
[02:22:00]  Wait, is that...  What?  No, no, no, no.  No, he's 100, and I just...  Because the only night backstage, I asked him...  His fighting weight, really, back in the day, when we were younger, was probably a buck  90.  He's less than that.  No, he's a buck 95, because Lenny's less...  I mean, Kenny's less than him, and Kenny's...  Holy shit.  Kenny's a buck 80, I think.  He's really, really skinny.  Yeah, he doesn't need to lose any more weight.  No, he looks muscular.  He works out a lot.  He's kind of a...  Muscular?  He's gotten into that.  Meaning, like, he goes...  He goes, God, it hit my stomach! 
[02:22:30]  And, like, he's in fucking...  Yeah.  He's on a hard stomach.  That's how Houdini died.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't do that.  Don't do that to Lenny.  But he fucking got addicted, like he wants the food, to fucking working out.  And it's like, once you make that switch, fuck, man.  It's a good one to make.  It is a good one to make.  Would you want to go back to a network show, or do you like the cable things like FX and  stuff?  I mean...  As a producer, and I'm trying, I am dying for the next, you know, three-camera show that 
[02:23:00]  works on television that is pretty good, and will just manufacture money for me that I  don't have to be in.  So I'm trying.  I signed a bunch of people, and I'm developing some stuff with some guys.  Right.  I got some cable half hours that I'm doing, you know, guys like Jim that are really talented  that I kind of want to, you know, get a really good quality show.  Sure, yeah.  But right now, I'm just, I'm back in, you know, I'm taking it easy.  I'm doing some movies.  Because the idea that...  I love television. 
[02:23:30]  I really do.  I love writing for it.  I love acting in it.  So I'm not saying I won't go back, but for right now, I'm just going to, I'm going to  ride the Spider-Man thing until, until that ends, and I got Ice Age 4.  I'm going to ride that until Ice Age 9.  I'm talking to them, I'm saying, listen, there's no reason we can't bring these Ice Age characters  like through the Civil War, into Vietnam.  I mean, I just want to, I just want to ride the gravy train for a little bit, you know what  I mean?  I can only imagine what you bought with that money.  The Ice Age money.  I know, the Ice Age money.  And now, hopefully, it's Spider-Man.  That's three, that's three movies. 
[02:24:00]  It's big.  I know.  The, uh, I don't ride that, how do you think, of all the guys, Spider-Man, I thought I would  never be, uh, that's huge, you know?  How, how do you think Rescue Me would have worked without the freedom that you have on,  on, uh, FX, though?  Who knows?  You can't answer the question, right?  I mean, they were, they were, like, just a hunch, though, because you guys were able  to cover material, use real language, you know, stuff like that.  I watch network shows on CBS and NBC and stuff, and you're like, they just, you want 
[02:24:30]  them to take it further.  Yeah, but you know what the more, you know what the more important thing is, because  you know going into network that you can't, it's like making a PG movie versus an R, right?  Right.  So you know that.  That's a, that's a given.  When you go to cable, I don't care about, uh, the language and behavior, we, you know  that's what you want.  You can have as much of that as you want.  If you don't get marketed the right way, that's movies and television and records, man.  That's like, people have to know you're out there, and that's the thing, FX was, not  only were they great creatively for us, but the fact that they marketed it, and HBO markets, 
[02:25:00]  well, people have to know when your show is on, what it's about, and, and how to find  it.  Yeah, and you put FX on the map, let's be honest.  No, we didn't.  I didn't know FX until Rescue Me.  They were there from the beginning with FX, almost like you are associated with FX being  so popular.  What did they have before you?  I don't even remember.  The Shield and Nip Tuck.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Okay, and the Shield was just taken off, and Nip Tuck was just starting.  Fair enough.  So we, we really, unless Chiklis had agreed to do the Shield, that was the big thing for  them, because that was a quality show, and they needed an actor who could, who could really 
[02:25:30]  pull it off.  I just feel like you brought Rescue Me and Terry Rooms, you know, living rooms.  I know, but we wouldn't have done that without Chiklis and the Shield.  I didn't realize FX did Nip Tuck.  Chiklis was, that was an amazing show.  Yeah, you're right.  And Nip Tuck, I didn't realize that was FX.  You're right.  I didn't either.  Yeah.  So we, we were very lucky that they already had those two.  They knew, they had already marketed the Shield and done well, and Nip Tuck, they were beginning.  And, and it was a hot show, so we really lucked out.  I find it hard, I find it hard, though, just to watch anything on, on ABC or NBC or CBS. 
[02:26:00]  It's fucking horrendous.  And I understand what you're saying.  It's tough.  It's tough.  It's like, all right, PG and R, but sometimes they try to pull off an R show, but without.  See what they're, they're better off is.  Some of the elements.  And, and this is, again, this is like the, one of the most difficult things in the world,  I think, is to get, is to take a comic sensibility, like Seinfeld or Ray Romano is the two best  examples, and actually make the thing translate into television and then make it great.  Because Seinfeld is a great show.  And much like Jerry's stand-up, they do risque things, but it never involves language. 
[02:26:30]  You never feel like you're being, right?  It's content, though.  It fits.  It fits.  Same with Ray.  And that same, Ray's show is fantastic, and they, they did some controversial things,  but they weren't considered controversial because they, it goes through Ray's filter.  Yeah.  Like when his wife has the baby in the back of the taxi cab, and his brother, the cop, is with him.  So the whole comedy of that is that his brother has to be staring right at his wife's vagina.  And they pull it off, and it works.  So it is when they do stuff like, hey, let's try to be cable. 
[02:27:00]  It's never going to work.  It's because you have the juxtaposition.  And Dennis asked me if I could get juxtaposition into a conversation.  I decided I could do it.  Congrats.  I got to pay, what is it, 40 bucks?  And you used all your tiles.  And cable with regular.  It's like there's too much cable now.  What's your show going to be?  To see the comparison.  Cable.  Basic cable.  Premium.  I want it to be on, it's got to either, it has to be cable.  I wouldn't even pitch the network.  I would never, if my manager wanted me to pitch the network, I said no.  So what network? 
[02:27:30]  I don't know which network.  I know that FX is a great network.  HBO is a great network.  Showtime.  There's a bunch of places.  Now there's a bunch of places for shows.  Netflix is a real option because Chappelle is doing something.  Fucking Stars because Albrecht is fucking great there.  IFC.  A&E is doing stuff.  They're not doing comedies, but there's a lot of places.  It's opening up again.  Yeah.  And a lot of them are owned by the same parent company.  So you get advertising on different platforms too.  Right.  It's not just the same one.  As soon as somebody cracks the mold where you can have it, where you can go online and  subscribe to the Jim Norton show and have it pumped to your computer every week, everything 
[02:28:00]  is going to change.  Nobody knows.  My kids don't know what number or where these networks are.  They just know the shows and they watch them download.  They watch them on the computer or they download them to the TV.  So if you say like, hey, that new show that you're talking about, what network is that  on?  They go, I don't know.  But, you know, it's, you can get it off of Hulu or whatever, right?  I remember having to be home at a certain time to watch a show.  That's because you're 50. 
[02:28:30]  My birthday is this month, by the way.  How old are you going to be?  43.  Jesus.  Aw, Jimmy.  How's the hip?  Hip is fine.  Tits and stomachs, not so good.  Well, Uriah Faber gave you some help on that.  Yes, he did.  He told me how to work out.  Jimmy doesn't like taking his shirt off at the beach.  No, I like to do the elliptical machine.  I like to play my fucking chess app.  And fucking do the elliptical machine.  You play chess while you're working out?  Did you see the Bobby Fischer documentary?  Of course.  Sure.  Holy fuck.  I'm not even a chess guy remotely.  I don't play chess.  Yeah.  That fucking thing was amazing.  I love Bobby Fischer. 
[02:29:00]  I cried when he died.  I just fucking, he's one of my lifelong idols.  Even though he was crazy, that genius, there's a price you pay.  That's all there is to it.  But they said that when those guys play, like Kasparov would play, when they would play championship  games, it's the equivalent mentally of doing the New York Times crossword puzzle in your  head.  Like, that's the level of brilliance you need to figure out what they're doing.  There's two things I'm not doing.  Outside my box.  So how are you interested in this?  I can't do a crossword puzzle.  Me neither.  If I do a phone call that's longer than like seven, six minutes, I have such bad ADD, I 
[02:29:30]  start going, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I can't do it.  Yes.  I mean, watching the Bobby Fischer movie, I can't, I don't even know what they're doing.  I just thought it was a remarkable story, but my head would explode early, early in  the match.  I always blow it.  If the pawn gets moved, my head explodes.  I don't know what to do.  It's over.  Larry's head has exploded.  Am I white or black?  Which one am I?  White or black?  I forgot.  You know what chess players hate?  When I'm going to play them and I go, can the horsey do this? 
[02:30:00]  That's always a giveaway that you're not a fucking good chess player.  Can the horsey?  Do you play with the clock?  I would play with the, you know the Red Sox versus Yankees chess set they have?  Oh, do you?  Yeah, they have one.  Wow.  Big Papi moves four squares.  What's going to do, Jeter?  I just like fucking traditional chess tricks.  You try to jump with the bishop.  I tell you, I should have figured that you were like a chess guy.  But I'll never be great.  I'm a very average player.  I play against people.  You do all right, man.  I play like a fucking, I have like six or seven going at once on this called chess with  friends. 
[02:30:30]  And I play against people on the computer.  It's great.  But I'll never be great.  When did you start doing chess?  When I was probably in fourth grade.  Jesus, really?  Yeah.  I won my first game against this guy, Cliff Herzog.  And I think they said he cheated, but I wound up winning the game.  But I'll never be great.  Like, literally, for as long as I live, I'll never be as good.  It's Cliff Herzog.  He's calling you.  No, it's Roland.  I'll never be.  Did I have to leave?  Hold on.  I think they do.  I love Chinese checkers.  Hey, how are we doing on time?  No, I think you guys got to leave.  No, no, no.  We don't leave.  He said, can you promote Dennis' tour? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, of course we will.  We have tickets to give away a pair to each tour.  We totally forgot why we were here.  A pair to each one.  So we want to promote that.  What time is it?  It's almost nine.  Oh, yeah.  No, they do have to leave.  I have a little bit of time.  Okay, good.  Tickets, DennisLeary.com.  But July 8th, Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut.  July 10th, the Palace Theater in Albany.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  July 13th, MPAC, Morristown, New Jersey.  And the 15th, the Wilmont in Montclair, New Jersey.  That's it?  Final rescue tour.  Yeah, because then I got to go.  Do some other stuff.  I have to start going around, doing all the talk shows. 
[02:31:30]  How many tickets do we have for this?  I think a pair to each.  And Rescue Me premieres July 13th.  Next week.  July 13th, yeah.  And the final episode is September, the week before 9-11, 10th anniversary.  So it's coming up.  This is it.  Final run.  Damn.  You have a great career, man.  You have a really great career.  It's like, because you're still known as a comedian, too.  It's not, you haven't just made the jump to actor where nobody knows you're a comic anymore.  Yeah.  Like, I met, I went to the Curb premiere last night, and I met a guy I used to love,  a guy named David Steinberg.  You know, David's kid's stand-up.  Yeah, he was a great comedian.  Used to host the Tonight Show all the time. 
[02:32:00]  He was a funny motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah.  But we said hello, and we talked for a minute, and he goes, you're probably one of the only  guys that remembers me as a comedian.  Everybody else knows me as a director.  He's wrong.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, he's a big director now.  But, uh.  He was a brilliant comic.  I loved him as a comedian.  Yeah.  He was hilarious.  He was the booga booga guy.  I don't know.  I remember that.  Because he became such a famous director, I'm guessing, um, but you've managed to have  both.  Like, you're still doing a lot of stand-up.  But don't you have the itch to continue your stand-up?  You would imagine he would want to just do it.  I don't know.  It's too busy.  Like, you get the itch, right, Dennis? 
[02:32:30]  I know, but if you're direct, well, I get to do it, I mean, every fall, you know.  But you don't have to.  All these years, every fall, I would do my comics come home.  Yeah, I love it.  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  But it's different, like, doing it because you love it and doing it because you have to do it.  Right.  And in David's case, he probably was a guy that was working on the road a lot.  And when you're directing, you know, directing takes over your whole life because you've got  to be not only on the set every day, but for months beforehand, you're in pre-production.  So he probably fell in love with that and he got to stay home. 
[02:33:00]  And Carson left, too, which is guest host.  Jay doesn't have guest hosts.  So he was a big guest host for Johnny.  So that main plug, that main thing keeping him, you know, in everybody's mind.  By the way, once Rescue Me is over and I get through all this press stuff, I'm going to  be the first official guest host of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  And I'm going to be hosting that, like, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I think.  He doesn't know about it.  He has no clue about that, does he?  No, but it's going to happen.  Oh, it's happening.  Oh, it's happening.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Fuck.  That's a great thing.  The cool thing about doing stand-up now is we get to do it together.  Because, you know, we have to do it.  You're like an astronaut.  It's just you on the road doing it.  When we get to do the tour, we all get to do it together.  Why is that just like an astronaut?  Because you're just in a suit floating around on the road.  It's actually nothing like an astronaut.  I know.  Astronauts go up in, like, just three guys at a time.  In a space shuttle, there's four.  Try to make an analogy, color in the story a little bit.  And they're changing the future of the planet.  Forget it.  Forget it.  But notice we were going to allow that, though. 
[02:34:00]  Dennis had to bring it up.  We were going to allow the astronaut analogy.  We were going to allow it to happen.  To me, part of the fun of being an astronaut when I was a kid was there was like four guys.  It was like, wow, you can go up there and party in space.  Yeah, that was it.  Like, if you do something cool on the moon, there's at least two other guys that went like,  that was pretty cool.  I saw it with my own eyes.  And there's no astronaut with red hair pulling props out while other astronauts insult him.  You can't get up on moon rocks. 
[02:34:30]  As far as we know.  Oh, that's funny.  And another astronaut stealing that bit and taking it to another planet.  I was going to say that.  Like, fuck it.  That was actually what Buzz Aldrin wanted to say.  One small step for a man.  Buzz Aldrin, by the way, speaking of astronauts.  Oh, he's pleasant.  I was going to say that.  No, he's not.  He's a little crazy.  He's just a cranky old guy, but he was on the moon, for God's sake.  I don't begrudge him.  He's a brilliant guy.  Yeah, we interviewed him once, and then I got a picture with him, and I met him at 
[02:35:00]  an event, and I asked him to sign the photo of us.  And he goes, ah, he didn't want to sign it.  So then my girlfriend at the time started talking to him, and she walks over, and she  goes, give me the picture.  I'm like, why?  And she goes, I think you want to fuck me.  Give me the picture.  So she fucking takes it over and gets it signed.  And she, because Buzz's wife was there, so I don't know if he was this photo.  And she got him to sign the picture.  Oh, great.  Because she had said, hey, I want to get a picture signed.  And when he saw the picture, he realized it was the one he had turned down.  He was so annoyed.  And his wife goes, just sign it.  Sign that damn thing.  Just to get rid of this fucking chick. 
[02:35:30]  Boy, Jim, you're really like Mr. Lunatic, celebrity picture checker.  He's a crazy.  He's a crazy.  You have no idea.  Sometimes I get great stories out of it and bits out of it, but I don't do it to be  ironic.  I genuinely love it.  No, you love it, right?  I genuinely love it.  Diana Ross turned me down on a plane, so I got a bit out of it.  A lot of times, I don't get a bit out of it.  A lot of times, it's just a moment in my life.  Jimmy sings the blues.  Exactly.  I did talk to her about Lady Sings the Blues.  I love Pryor, and she got fucking irritated with me because I mentioned Bustin' Lewis.  Pryor was great in that movie, man.  Phenomenal.  He was almost nominated.  Pryor was a great, dramatic actor. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, he really was.  I mean, did you ever see Blue Collar?  Yes.  With him and Keitel and Yafek Koto?  Yafek Koto, sure.  Oh, my God.  Terrific, terrific.  What are you looking at?  What are you pointing at?  I got to interrupt for a second.  I apologize, Dennis.  Casey Anthony, now that the trial is over.  I was going to bring that up.  She fucking let her hair down, and she's looking all fucking sexy.  I was going to bring that up.  Holy shit.  Now she's got her hair down.  Look at her look.  It's completely different.  She's wearing a bikini.  Yeah, she's wearing a bikini.  Fuck the tuxedo shirt.  Look at her.  She's ready to go out and party. 
[02:36:30]  You know what?  Holy shit.  You just said casino instead of tuxedo.  You know what that's a sign of?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Old age?  It's old age, plus you may have a tumor.  You may have a brain tumor.  Oh, no, really?  Yeah, because he said casino instead of tuxedo.  Yeah.  I'm no doctor.  Well, then actually you are.  But then again, Adam said astronaut instead of comedian.  So what does that mean?  It's spreading.  What does that mean, then?  Oh, that's funny.  Look at this.  Look at this shit, man.  She's all dolled up now.  Okay, listen.  Now that the case is over.  By the way, dolled up, you're being very kind. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  She looks like she got hit by a couple of trucks on the way for three years.  She probably had a few of them matronly, big-boned, dykey women in jail that know how to take care of a girl like that.  Grab her by the hair and just smash it in a big unshaven muff.  Yeah.  You know that's what's going on in there.  Let's see.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Mom's house.  You retire tomorrow.  You start saying shit like that around your pool. 
[02:37:30]  Eventually, the neighbors are going to call the police.  He keeps using the words matronly and muff, and we're not happy about it.  Look, we put up the fence.  We can still hear him.  Oh, believe me.  Believe me, after this weekend's party.  No, the neighbors should have called the police a long time ago, Dennis.  The neighbors shut down.  I was screaming shit out.  You got a five-day party that just ended.  Yeah, you have no other options career-wise.  Look at his face.  This is going to be it.  You're not going to get away with this anywhere else.  My pool beat me up at my own party.  Look at his face.  He had a hell of a party the last few days.  Then I went shooting with Daniel Craig the other day.  It was fucking fantastic.  That's shooting with James fucking Bond. 
[02:38:00]  I'm shooting with James Bond.  Yeah, my Walther PPKs.  What are you going to shoot with Daniel Craig for?  Out east.  Me and I know his security guy, Mike.  By Joe's.  The range by Joe's.  I don't even have a security guy.  I need a security guy.  Who doesn't?  Well, he's James Bond.  By the way, can I just say something?  I'm a big James Bond fan, and I like Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  But we all know you have to reinvent the franchise.  I thought when that guy, that first James Bond movie, fantastic.  And all those critics that tore him a new asshole when they first hired him and said he was going to suck. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  As soon as that first movie started, the first ten minutes, I went, where are these assholes now?  Yeah, yeah.  Because he is good.  They rebooted the whole thing.  He's fantastic.  That was probably one of the best bathroom fight scenes I've ever seen.  At the beginning, we got him black and white, as he's remembering.  He's great.  Smashing faces into urinals.  Yeah.  It's like here.  He's a great actor.  It's like him.  You know who I want to see take over as James Bond?  Brian Dennehy.  I think he'd be a fucking great James Bond.  I love Brian Dennehy.  I do, too.  Bond. 
[02:39:00]  I just saw Silverado again recently.  He plays the evil sheriff in that.  I got a photo with him.  It annoyed him a lot.  It's like, you bring up anybody.  I think I saw Jesus last week.  You know what?  Jesus wouldn't take a picture.  He didn't take a picture.  It was while Dennehy was doing Death of a Salesman on Broadway, and he yelled out during  the performance.  Yeah, can I get one?  No, I just saw him at an after thing.  Give him the quick list of people you hate, because they didn't take a photo with you.  There's been very few.  Honestly.  Jeter.  Jeter.  No, Jeter took the picture.  He wouldn't sign it.  I had a run in with him.  Jeter was a good guy.  Jimmy hates Jeter.  I don't hate him anymore. 
[02:39:30]  Jeter's a good guy.  You're over at Firely.  He was a charitable guy.  Jeter did one of the ads for Rescue Me last year.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  I had a run in with him, but whatever.  He hates you.  He probably does.  A run in.  And by the way...  When I first met him, I said, Derek, thank you so much for coming and doing this commercial.  He said, you're a comedian too, right?  I said, yeah.  He goes, you're friends with that fucking asshole Jim Norton.  I can't believe you're bringing that up right now.  He's giving that a bad name.  A run in, by the way, with Jeter.  Is Jimmy waiting outside the bathroom door at a charity event for him to sign something? 
[02:40:00]  That's a run in.  It was a picture of me and him.  Regardless.  All right.  All right.  So who else?  Very few have turned me down.  He did.  De Niro has once, but he was not rude about it.  It was at a thing.  What about the other Yankee?  Who was the other Yankee?  We ran out of the Brooklyn Diner.  What did De Niro say to you?  I asked him.  It was the premiere of 700 Sundays.  Had you asked him?  I didn't.  Oh, fuck.  He was sitting there.  This is my favorite.  Face at him like you're talking.  I'm not going to do anything crazy.  You're talking.  He's talking.  I tapped his form and I went, Bob.  I fucking called him Bob. 
[02:40:30]  And he was nice.  I said, can I get a photo?  And he goes, no.  He goes, because if I take one, a lot of people will ask.  Which is true.  Which is true.  And I knew he was telling the truth.  And Randy Johnson was telling the truth.  He's like the picture taking human Congress.  I knew he was telling the truth.  He wasn't lying like Jeter.  Yeah, I knew it.  Randy Johnson was a complete asshole.  He ran away down like 57th Street.  And look, I'm not bothered like those guys are. 
[02:41:00]  But I've taken enough fan photos to know when it's annoying.  It's like when you're eating.  I never bother people when they're with their kids.  Like I saw, I've never.  There's times where you just don't do it.  But there's other times where it's like, it's a half a second.  And I know how I am with fans.  Even though they are like what I have times 500.  It is really true if you take one.  And, you know, if you're notable enough, you take one.  And everybody in the room wants one.  And you're screwed.  And their head goes right to,  but you took one with Jim Norton.  Right, right, right.  So I understood De Niro saying no.  And I saw him again at the Comedy Cellar one night. 
[02:41:30]  He saw my set.  He was there with somebody.  And I didn't ask him.  Because they're saying he might be doing research for a role.  So I didn't want to make him uncomfortable in that place to come back.  So, I mean, I'm not a fucking idiot about it.  Oh, well.  But now I look back on it.  He hasn't been back.  So I should have asked him.  Yeah, you probably should have.  Oh, Frank Vincent turned me down too.  Really?  Going backstage at a Kiss concert because he was in the middle of something.  I'm like, hey, Frank.  Frank Vincent doing it at a Kiss concert, by the way.  I'm like, hey, Frank, can I get a picture with you?  He goes, nah, not now.  And I go, if I get the camera ready, he goes, I said not now. 
[02:42:00]  Jesus.  And he had.  But I got him when we interviewed him.  He's a very nice man.  And he turns out to be a nice guy.  Frank's a good guy.  Very nice guy.  What a great actor.  Don't get nervous.  What a great actor.  Oh, my party.  I haven't said that to him.  Go home and get your fucking shine box.  I love the fact that his party was three people in a balloon.  Oh, my party.  Hey, by the way, you guys know him and Pesci were a comedy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We've talked to him about it.  It's amazing.  Yeah, the hell of a book, right, Jimmy?  And he was a terrific drummer.  We got Dana White coming in today, too, at 930.  What?  I guess that's a last minute thing.  I tweeted him. 
[02:42:30]  I said, are you doing our show?  We got to get going.  I didn't know.  Yeah, you guys didn't ask me anything.  No, I can take a hint.  First of all, you didn't ask me for a picture.  Number one.  Number two.  Number two.  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, no, no.  You insulted him just a little bit.  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  You touched my forearm.  You said, Bob, instead of Dennis.  Now, you insulted me just a little bit.  Dennis, you keep him here.  You can shoot him right in his big mouth.  Do you know my Dennis Leary picture is from fucking back at NEW?  I have a fucking pussy boy sweater.  And, yeah, that's way.  I have an old photo of me and Dennis. 
[02:43:00]  Dennis has been doing our show for many years, man.  Ten years, man.  I was going to start the first time I met Dennis.  Very much.  And he was nice.  Absolutely.  Comedians are always nice to each other.  Let's get these guys out of here.  So, what's the big part?  What are we doing?  Rescue Me.  Yes, of course.  When is it?  Next week.  July 13th.  It starts our final season.  It's going to be another great season.  And then the tour.  And the rescue me comedy tour this Friday.  Jim Norton's upcoming future television show, which we don't have dates on yet, but it's  coming.  You'll figure it out.  What else?  Top Gear.  I'm going to get my plug in. 
[02:43:30]  Top Gear.  Top Gear.  Sure, sure.  The 24th.  When am I going to get to the drive-fist?  Spider-Man.  Ice Age next summer.  Unbelievable.  Anthony quitting radio and appearing only in his backyard for the last 20 years of his  life.  These are the things that we're pushing.  That sounds like paradise.  Our plugs suck compared to theirs.  Go to DennisLeary.com for the comedy show info.  And I think we've got a pair of tickets for each show.  Yes, you do.  It's the way right now, so just call and we'll figure it all out.  It's the final Rescue Me comedy tour, so it's the last time to see everybody together, 
[02:44:00]  I guess.  And by the way, if Jim Norton comes backstage and wants to take a picture, we're all taking  pictures with him.  Whether he wants it or not.  Because as a matter of fact, he may not even want him and we're going to take the pictures  with him.  Absolutely.  This time, he's going to be the one saying, nah, nah.  I think we should sketch something.  Make him sit there and pose.  Can you get me one with Bob Kelly?  He's a tough one to get.  Oh, Jesus.  Away from the dinner table.  Exactly.  You need a hubble.  Is Bob big again?  Is he big again?  Yeah, Bob was then.  He said he's got two more fats in him. 
[02:44:30]  I think he's got one.  He's going to get fat, skinny, and then fat and skinny.  I used to hear Lenny say that when he was fat.  I got two more fats in me.  I got two more fats in me and then I'm done.  Bob is so fat, he's almost a guru.  Bob is fucking, yeah.  Bob is, I'm worried about Bob.  I'm at a point where I can't even make fun of him anymore and I see him, I'm just like,  buddy, you got it.  I'll help you.  I'm worried about Bob.  That's terrible.  Oh.  That's terrible.  I'm worried about Bob.  I haven't seen him.  Last time I saw him, he was like bobblehead skinny.  Yeah.  The head was still big, but he's a little skinny.  He'll lose it though, because Bob can lose the weight.  He's one of those guys that can drop it off.  He's sick of me, if he wants to.  That's bad.  Let's get him out of here. 
[02:45:00]  Dennis Leary, I'm for our pleasure once again.  Guys, thanks so much.  Dane White stopped by to say hi next.  Stay there.  There's your rush.  Yeah.  Dennis Leary and I, I'm for our just left.  They were great.  We just talked to him for the last 15 minutes off here.  I know.  I was thinking to stay.  I wanted to do something, but I'm like, I can't stay in here.  And then you start bugging Dennis to read my script.  I can't do that.  That's not left. 
[02:45:30]  I think you're going to get a call.  No, I don't think so.  He's a very good dude, though.  But I had to leave.  I think you'd get a call.  I had to leave just so I didn't do that.  Just so you didn't do that?  Yeah, I don't want to be that guy.  Oh, really?  So you were so compelled to do it that you figured, I better fucking just remove myself.  Yeah, because I don't want to be that annoying asshole guy.  When someone says something politely to you, you know what I mean?  You don't want to be the fucking annoying dude.  It's going to happen, Jimmy.  If you go through the proper Leary Production Company channels, I think that's a lot better  than actually talking to the guy. 
[02:46:00]  Nah, whatever.  He's dead.  Dana White's stopping by.  Very happy about that.  I think I cornered him this morning.  I checked my Twitter, and he had a red eye, and he goes, just landed in New York, and he's  got millions of followers.  So I'm thinking, fuck, if I write him right now, how many people are actually writing on  Twitter?  I said, hey, man, are you coming by today?  And I think we got him.  I think he's going to be here in like 10 minutes and say hi.  He'd respond to you anyway, though.  Huh?  I think he'd respond to you anyway.  No, but his Twitter is so busy, it's almost impossible for me to get a message to him. 
[02:46:30]  I don't think he follows me officially.  I don't really know, to be honest with you.  So I couldn't DM him.  So I just wrote on my Twitter, hey, he's stopping by, and I guess it got to him, because  he is.  Chuck tweeted me.  I was very surprised.  Me and Liddell were talking, you know, a couple of, and he goes, hey, let's take a picture.  He asked me for a photo.  Liddell asked me for a photo.  If I had any balls, I would have said no.  You should have said no.  But then he Twittered it.  I was very happy. 
[02:47:00]  That's very cool.  Yeah, it's very cool when guys that you fucking love kind of like you, too.  Acts as separately alleged do not lie.  Casey Anthony's being sentenced.  Well, oh, wait, wait.  They just, the prosecution's not sitting.  Three, seven, third edition, what page?  See, what the prosecution is saying is that Casey Anthony lied four times.  10, 67.  So they went four separate sentences.  I do have a copy.  Now, what the defense is saying is it was just one lie over the course of the same instance. 
[02:47:30]  Just lying over the same instance.  How long is the sentencing going to take, Ant?  14 weeks.  Shouldn't this be quick?  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  They both give their little side of the story.  And then the judge says.  The best part of that, the judge isn't in listening because he already knows what he's doing.  But one thing we're noticing, Casey Anthony, boy, she let her hair down.  She sure did.  Before everybody started yapping, she was toying with her hair and getting it right and smiling. 
[02:48:00]  She was, like, kind of cutely chewing on her pinky and throwing her hair around.  Yep.  I don't even think she cares if she gets, like, 18 months.  She's got lipstick on.  Her makeup's different.  They let her buy some prison makeup.  Oh, boy.  What did that cost her?  I know.  That's like a few cigarettes and a fucking vag lick.  A broom handle to the asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to spin around five times on a broomstick up your asshole. 
[02:48:30]  And you get some homemade lipstick.  Yeah.  And then you get some homemade lipstick.  From the beets we didn't want to eat.  From somebody that was just shanked blood.  Right.  The prosecution's response here.  Yeah, see, they're bored, too.  Everyone's bored.  Poor HLN, which is the headline news, which used to just be CNN's, like, kind of every  20 minutes, they'd go over the same stories.  They have had their highest ratings ever, ever in its history.  Once this happens... 
[02:49:00]  They're done.  They're done, and they know it, so they're milking the shit out of it.  That Nancy Grace piece of shit.  Nancy Grace is fucking despicable.  Ate her.  Tot mom.  Tot mom.  What will Tot mom do?  What will Tot mom be sentenced to?  Shut up with your Tot mom.  I fucking hate her.  Hate her, Jimmy.  I hate her.  She's a fucking hateable, ugly, fucking Dutch boy-haired bitch.  Oh, she is a wreck.  Hater.  I don't know.  Defense interviews with police was one continuous lie, not four separate lies. 
[02:49:30]  But that's great.  That's what the defense is saying.  That's what your argument is.  That's great.  That's what the defense's argument is.  That's good.  Hey, it's one lie.  It just went to whole, you know...  Well, what are we going to do?  Now, let's see.  Let's say something happened.  Yeah.  And you lie about it.  But you tell a few different lies about the same story.  Okay, here it is.  Something's missing from the studio.  You know who did it.  You bring him in...  Let's say extra space is missing from the studio.  Right.  Extra space is missing.  We bring in one of the cute guys. 
[02:50:00]  You know, not cute in a looks way.  Right.  You know, cute that they think they actually do something around here.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[02:50:30]  Is that all the same lie, because it's one topic, or did he tell four different lies right there?  What?  Exactly.  No, your nose is really distracting.  I know, isn't it?  Yes.  It's a fucking mess.  What, did I just wake up, or did the lights get brighter?  Your face is fucked up.  I am fucked, dude.  I am fucked.  Your face is fucked up.  Why didn't I notice it earlier, as much as I am now? 
[02:51:00]  Did we turn the lights up?  I think I looked up a little bit.  Yeah, it's fucked up.  Did you break your nose?  No, but I had that feeling, that goosh, like, wah, kind of, oh, damn, that sucks.  I didn't hit it hard, is what it is.  I scraped it.  I swear to you.  Up the side of the pool.  I don't know what you just said, because I was just staring at your nose.  What did you say?  I'm just saying four separate lies that are the same subject.  Right.  You could put that into one lie?  You could say it's just, you're being deceptive to the police. 
[02:51:30]  You're not counting lies, it was deception.  She lied to the police.  But four different counts means what?  Okay, saying that there was a nanny that wasn't.  Saying that the kid was, that she had a job at, realistically start coming up with the  cost.  They want her to pay for the investigation, too.  She should, because she had been a lie.  She ain't going to pay for shit, though.  Does your client wish to say anything prior to the court imposed?  Oh, here it comes.  Here it comes. 
[02:52:00]  No, Your Honor.  I say...  Here we go.  Less than six months.  Nope.  Crank it up.  Crank it up.  What do you got, Ann?  What do you got?  I don't know.  I got a boner for her.  Hurry, fast.  I got a boner for her.  I said less than six.  She walks.  Full time.  She's walking.  No, she's not.  What's full time, Jimmy?  Four years?  Whatever the max is.  The court will make the following finding concerning the defense motion to bar imposition  of sentence on these four distinct counts as violating... 
[02:52:30]  She looks shitty today, by the way.  Double justice.  No, she's a little scared.  Count for the indictment alleging providing false information to a law enforcement officer  basically dealt with the following conduct.  It is alleged that the defendant was employed at Universal Studios during the year 2008. 
[02:53:00]  Liar!  This information was given pursuant to an investigation for a missing persons.  That information caused law enforcement, in following up on that statement, to go to  Universal Studios to expend law enforcement resources. 
[02:53:30]  They could have went on some ride while they were there.  Yeah, look for a mouse.  Confrontation.  That, in fact, Ms. Anthony did not, in fact, work at Universal Studios.  Oops.  Count five.  Ms. Anthony informed the authorities that she had left her child, Kelly Marie Anthony,  with the nanny, with the nanny, Zanny, at the Sawgrass Apartments. 
[02:54:00]  Zanny the nanny.  She's Sawgrass.  With a babysitter.  Yeah.  Which caused law enforcement, again, as a result of a missing persons report.  Missing persons.  This looks good.  To develop...  No, for her to get out.  There were various leaders...  See, I'm pulling for her.  ...trying to locate this babysitter, commonly known as Zanny.  Which were, by the way, Zanny's. 
[02:54:30]  She was giving the child to go to sleep so she could fucking party.  Dealt with the fact that she had informed two, quote, employees of Universal Studios, Jeff  Hopkins, and Juliette Lewis, of the disappearance of Kelly Marie Anthony.  Again, for missing persons.  Again.  Pursuant to, and thereof.  Is that on count seven?  Indicated to law enforcement that she had received a call and spoke to Kelly Marie Anthony 
[02:55:00]  on July 15, 2008, at approximately 12 p.m.  Oh, boy.  No, that wasn't happening.  Thus causing law enforcement to devote extensive resources.  Guys loving the TV time, huh?  Judges are all like this.  Come on, let's go.  As a result of those four separate and distinct lines. 
[02:55:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  That ain't good.  Law enforcement expended a great deal of time, energy, and manpower looking for young Kelly  Marie Anthony.  Anthony.  The search for her went on from July. 
[02:56:00]  Could you see if she just went, would you get on with this already?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Over several months, trying to find Kelly Marie Anthony.  Four distinct separate lines.  Oh, boy.  This is not good.  As the jury spoke loud and clear on counts one, two, three, four, five, five, six, seven. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, shit.  Good.  Oh, shit.  There being no legal cause shown why this court should not impose a sentence.  And the court had previously adjudged you to be guilty of the crimes contained in counts four, five, six, seven.  Concurrent or consecutive? 
[02:57:00]  No, consecutive.  I will sentence you to one year in Orange County Jail, imposing a $1,000 fine on each count, all four counts, to run consecutive to each other.  Oh, yes.  Giving you credit for the time that you have previously served. 
[02:57:30]  How much time is that?  Mr. Baez, Mr. Mason, we're going to spend some time this morning figuring out her credit for time served.  And it's going to take us probably about an hour to sort of sort it out,  not because of the previous sentences that she has been given. 
[02:58:00]  But with the good time and game time, depending on preliminary figures.  Oh, figures.  Sometime early, August, maybe late July.  But I can't say that until after I first determine time served. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  And then the jail has to apply, according to their figures, their good time and game time that she has gained.  She'll get a couple of years at most.  Yeah.  So if you want to wait around or we can communicate that with you.  And if you have a different figure, then we can get that taken care of. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, figure.  I will reserve jurisdiction for 60 days.  What?  To determine the cost of prosecution and investigation.  How about, oh, wow.  That will cost her a bundle.  Do you want to have some time whenever they get around to providing information?  Do you want to pay for it, too?  Good.  Maybe.  Fucking rotten whore.  Do you want me to win?  When you'll be ready. 
[02:59:30]  I have been advised a minimum of 30, so any time after that would be acceptable.  How many, how many?  Wow.  How about bail?  Mr. Mason?  I don't want to have some time whenever they get around to providing and gathering up their  invoices so we can check the validity of those and potentially conduct some discovery  on it.  So at least 30 days, I would assume, if that's when she gets it to me.  If she gets it to me on the 29th day, that's not going to be good. 
[03:00:00]  That's true.  I believe I would do that to Mr. Mason.  You bastard prosecutors.  The defense and the prosecution are arguing when they're going to get the materials to  review to see.  Wants her to pay for the fucking prosecution.  Yeah.  Of the sheriff's office.  Wow.  How do you time off for it after she gets it to me?  Well, I'm trying to give you a date now. 
[03:00:30]  The week of August 15th, I will not.  She looks like she wants to kill something.  Fuck her.  Yeah, she does.  She already did.  She wants to kill something.  The week of the 22nd, I'm involved in an evidentiary hearing.  Oh, he's got an evidentiary hearing.  Wow.  Are we done with this?  I guess that's about it.  Yeah, I mean, she's got consecutive sentences.  A year, what was the maximum we could for lying to police? 
[03:01:00]  One year for...  Oh, you gave it the max.  So it's four years, but then...  Per occurrence.  But then it's time serves and all that.  He has to do time serves, right?  So it's a math problem.  So you got time serves, so you got, like, good time that she had.  Yeah, that's all, I guess.  But...  I was right.  She did three years in jail, right?  But some of that was before his check.  No, I know.  She won't even do three.  No, I said she did three already.  Oh, she did three already.  So the maximum, he could take all three years off, technically.  No, because some of that has to be attributed to her prior fraud case.  So she's going to do at least a year in jail.  It's going to be... 
[03:01:30]  Oh, yeah, at least.  Probably 18 months.  You would guess 18 months?  I think more than that.  She's got four years to run consecutively.  I say she's going to do two and a half years.  I want to know how much the time was already...  She has more time served than that.  Oh, does she?  Okay.  And with the good time added in...  Yeah, I'd say, like, maybe...  Wait, someone's saying early August, late July means he thinks that will be the end of  her time, including time served.  No, that's...  No, they have 30 days to get together.  That's when they're going to figure out some shit. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, he leaves it consecutively.  Not concurrent.  Yeah.  And they want to charge her for the prosecution because she lied.  That's great.  That's going to be a lot of money.  So at least, you know, she'll have to pay a lot of fucking money from any book deal  she gets.  That's that.  Well, that's why they're going to do that.  They want to keep her from making any money because technically she wasn't convicted  of the crime so she can write a book and make money off of it.  But can't they come after her for any...  Like, because she was convicted of lying, can't there be a way to block any book deal  or anything or her profiting because she was caught lying so anything she writes has 
[03:02:30]  to involve that lie unless she tells the truth?  Like, there's got to be a way of a technicality to get her on.  That's a tough one.  Because she's not writing a book about the lying.  She could write a book about her life growing up.  Oh, that's true.  All that happy horse shit.  Put it this way.  Good for him.  She ain't fucking...  Thursday's fine.  She ain't getting the death penalty.  That's for sure.  I don't know what news is. 
[03:03:00]  All right.  Well, she'll do a few years at least, total.  She already has.  She's just this...  She doesn't even...  It doesn't even seem to bother her at this point.  She like...  She's been in there for three years.  If she's got an out date of, you know, a year and a half, 18 months, something like  that, she'd be like, yeah, whatever.  She's comfortable in there, right?  Yeah.  She's fine.  She'll get out.  She'll still be, you know, early 20s, mid-20s, whatever.  And no problem. 
[03:03:30]  That's all I see.  She's got her whole life ahead of her.  Even after another 18 months.  And that'll give me time.  Here's what I understand here.  Start writing her.  Right.  To start writing some prison letters.  No.  Start dropping in.  Why haven't you already?  And visited.  Well, I don't want to be with the prison letters of everyone else during all this pandemonium.  So I'm going to start just slipping some prison letters in, right?  And then maybe go down for a visit.  And then visit a little chat. 
[03:04:00]  Chat it up.  And then by the time she's ready to get out, you know, here you go.  You got a place to stay.  Right?  It's nice.  You got a pool.  Even though the pool might make her a little leery at first.  I'll make sure to keep the children away.  Your pool has two victims now.  You and Danny, right?  Yes.  Same thing.  Me and Danny have both.  And the worst thing is, I was laughing at Danny about fucking his nose up in the pool.  And this morning I came in. 
[03:04:30]  I poked in the office.  I went, Danny.  And I pointed at it.  And he goes, ah, you fucking dick.  Ah.  He just laughed.  But I earned that.  I earned that.  You didn't have to use that kind of language, though.  Oh, language.  Language.  My home, young man.  We got to catch up.  So we'll take a quick break here.  Is Danny downstairs or no?  I don't know.  Oh.  And we'll wrap up the show next.  Stay there.  Wait, wait.  The virus.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[03:05:00]  That's 866-969-1969.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is cool.  Dane White stopped by to say hi.  I tweeted you, like, first thing this morning.  I don't even know if you got it.  You.  Every time I land in New York and I'm like, I'm in New York, my Twitter blows up.  You going on Opie and Anthony?  Every time.  It's like, all right, I'll stop by and say hi.  We had Uriah Faber in here.  I was telling you outside the studio.  Yeah.  And we've had him on the phone before.  And he's great, man. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, he is.  He's a great spokesperson.  He is.  He's dynamite.  And, you know, tough fight on Saturday, but great fight.  Great fight.  Exactly.  Exactly.  He, uh, but he looked great, you know.  He didn't look like a lot of the fighters when they lose a match.  It's, uh, oof.  Yeah.  You look worse.  I know.  Yeah.  The pool beat the shit out of me.  It really did, man.  How do you look worse than Uriah Faber?  I don't know.  I mean, come on.  The guy was right there brawling it out and... 
[03:06:00]  But Uriah was sober.  Yeah.  That could have something to do with it.  Possibly.  Like Guinness, and I don't know.  You jump in the pool.  It's a good thing.  Like, my pool's very deep, so I didn't smash on the bottom, but when I came up...  Swooping up.  I, like, you know, you kind of do that breaststroke thing to come up.  And that pushes you forward.  And I led with my nose.  Yeah, you did.  And just scraped that, my forehead, right against the...  We're still talking about his nose.  ...side of the gunite.  Oh, yeah.  And the gunite pool might as well be just sandpaper, so... 
[03:06:30]  And Uriah was in here, and he didn't have a scratch on him.  Did they mention that?  Yeah, not a mark on him.  Yeah, we mentioned it.  How humiliated it is.  He was beaten up by his fucking pool and six cases of liquor.  By the way, I'm sorry if I...  I just shook hands with Dana when I came back in, and I have, like, a long nail, so I  feel like my nail's scraped.  You did.  It's really feminine.  Why did I get a long nail?  I thought you were going to say sorry.  You just took a piss, and you shook my hand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know what I mean, man.  You can handle a nail.  What from, uh...  What are you getting from doing some coke?  What are you doing there, Jimmy? 
[03:07:00]  You know how if you pull your fingernail off, you're fucking going to rip skin up to the  neck?  Yeah.  So I had to go and chew it down.  Up to the neck.  So I didn't shake hands and get injured.  You got to pull forward.  You got to pull your finger away from you.  That's how you do it.  Yeah.  Great event, by the way.  Great fucking UFC event.  Thanks, man.  Jimmy was fortunate enough to be out there.  He just happened to be doing his thing.  Oh, what seats.  He didn't want to compete against you, Dana.  So he moved to show.  No, but you know what?  You should have done your show on Friday.  You got to do the Rogan thing.  Rogan goes the day before the event.  We had Seattle Friday, but also because Rogan's doing it, I don't want to compete with Rogan  either because Rogan's selling a lot of tickets, man. 
[03:07:30]  He's an animal, too.  Yeah.  I mean, 10 years ago, Rogan was kind of with the pack, but he's fucking...  We finally got Rogan on our channel, too.  We're so happy.  I know.  I heard that.  Yeah.  We're so happy.  That's cool.  Dana seemed to be right behind Couture and Chuck.  I had the best seats in the house.  Literally, I took a photo of the back of their heads.  I'm like, what a great place.  What a great place I'm sitting.  Tito Ortiz.  Dude.  Tito.  I can't...  He came in so psychotic-looking.  He looked like me trying to bluff my way out of a fight. 
[03:08:00]  He looked like you would look if you didn't really want to fight.  Yeah.  No, he did it, man.  He came in and pulled it off, and it looked like Bader froze and choked in that fight.  And Tito...  Listen, Tito...  I said it before the fight happened.  When his back is against the wall, that's when he fights his best.  Yeah.  And what a lot of people don't realize about Tito is how good his submissions are.  He's just never had to use them before.  He used to get people on their back and ground and pound them and would never take any risks.  But Tito's got...  And you saw, once he put that guillotine, you see how hard he was squeezing?  He was pulling... 
[03:08:30]  He looked like he was going to try to pop his head off.  Yeah.  He was really...  I could not believe how aggressive he was.  And I can't believe how badly Silva lost.  That was...  Yeah.  Well, I figured either one of those guys was going to get...  You know, you knew that was going to be a gunfight and somebody was getting knocked out in that fight.  Yeah, that was...  But I didn't expect it to be that fast.  Yeah.  That was literally...  Yeah.  You know, I guess he put his dukes up and he just...  It was 1930.  That's exactly what it was, though. 
[03:09:00]  Put up your dukes.  I got a tweet from Dana.  He goes, are you coming?  Because usually I would be there for all the fights, but I'm so used to East Coast now.  Right.  They fucking...  You guys went earlier and they started like 3 o'clock now.  Well, we bumped it...  We moved this...  When we did the Toronto fight, we bumped it an hour earlier because the people on the East Coast were just...  It was beating them up.  You know, the fights don't get over until 1 o'clock.  Right.  So we moved it an hour earlier and it throws a lot of people off.  Because especially if you're in Vegas, you know, the things used to start at 6. 
[03:09:30]  I mean, at 7.  Now we start at 6.  When we go live.  When we go live on pay-per-view.  Yeah.  So I came.  I missed some of the prelim fights and all that, but I just...  I wasn't thinking.  We flew in that morning.  I had to sleep a couple hours to sleep off the drive with me.  And fuck, man.  3 o'clock.  Who could fight at 3 o'clock?  It's amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, Dan has a new bodyguard.  He's a big kid, man.  Holy shit.  Isn't he huge?  He's Hawaiian.  He's from Hawaii, man.  Is he a fighter?  He is.  He's huge.  So when we walk places, I just stand behind him and walk and it's actually pretty nice. 
[03:10:00]  Nobody notices you, right?  No.  Nobody sees me.  Is he a fighter or no?  No.  He used to play football for University of Hawaii.  And he was one of the security guys over at Tristan XS for a while.  Good guy.  But how do you choose a bodyguard?  Because you're surrounded by guys that can all fight.  Well, my old guy that used to be with me, Tom, retired.  He was a former Metro police officer and he retired.  The guy has been a cop for 35 years and then he's flying all over the world with me every 
[03:10:30]  15 minutes.  So that sounds like a good gig.  That shit gets old quick.  Trust me.  It gets old quick.  You know what I mean?  And especially at his age.  So, you know, I got the new guy in and it's really this guy's just there.  I don't have security all the time.  Just at fights and other things.  Yeah, when people are going to be, a lot of people are going to be around and don't want  to be bothered.  No, I'm cool with everybody.  I hang out with fans and do all kinds of stuff.  It's just sometimes, I don't know if you guys ever saw the video blog from Toronto when 
[03:11:00]  we did, I tweeted up there and was tweeting tickets.  You know, there's sometimes it gets scary and you just get overwhelmed with so many people,  man.  It's crazy.  It's not, all of a sudden, meet me at the mall.  Yeah, that's exactly what I do.  Exactly.  Oh, you don't know that?  Oh, yeah.  I love hooking up with the fans.  You know, just sometimes it gets, it gets crazy.  And it's getting crazy.  You get in these situations sometimes, man, where people don't give a shit.  They just bomb rush you.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's what that was like at the end of the fight because I knew the other guy, 
[03:11:30]  but I didn't know this guy.  He's like, step aside, please.  And I'm like, all right, because he's a fucking fake kid.  I didn't want to argue.  But no, I know Vane.  Mr.  Yeah.  Yeah, you just, you talk later.  And he signed an autograph.  While you were signing autographs, he signed somebody's book, some fucking fat lady.  I caught him across the thing, handed him a thing, and she asked him to sign it.  And he did, and he shrugged like, what the fuck was that?  So it was very funny.  He signed his first autograph as your bodyguard.  And it's weird that, like, it's almost like some people, like, is Rihanna really a fight 
[03:12:00]  fan, or do you think she knows that that's just, like, is the place to be now?  Yeah, you know, it's funny because she called, she had the concert there, and her  people called and asked if she could get tickets to come over.  And let me tell you what, you know, in this position, you meet lots of celebrities and  whatever.  She was so cool.  She couldn't have been more down to earth or a better person.  And, you know, I love Justin Bieber, man.  He's such a good kid.  He's a really, really good kid. 
[03:12:30]  People hate on this kid.  This kid's fucking good looking.  He's talented.  He's making shit loads of money.  That's why everyone hates him.  No.  Jump in.  Exactly.  That is why everyone hates him.  We're jealous.  I got to jump in.  I was hanging with Brother Weasel this weekend.  He might have turned me on.  Justin Bieber.  I haven't even told you guys yet.  He goes, you got to watch this fucking movie.  He goes, it's easy to hate Justin Bieber.  He goes, that's the thing to do, is to hate Justin Bieber.  But if you see this fucking movie, it might turn you.  I saw the movie.  You did?  I saw the movie.  And people are saying this movie's amazing.  Yeah, it's awesome. 
[03:13:00]  The kid deserves everything he's got.  When you meet him, listen to this, too.  When I met him three months ago or four months ago at the MGM, they did the, when the music  awards were there.  So I had set it up through Paramount, this girl I know over Paramount, for my kids to meet  Justin Bieber.  However, we go over there, and you can imagine, this kid's fucking traveling all over the  ... Dude, I know what my life is like.  I'm fucking 41 years old, traveling around and all this shit, and this is what I do for 
[03:13:30]  a living.  This kid, at his age, getting pulled in all these different directions, and he's a million  times busier than me.  More people want to terrorize this kid than me.  And for this kid to deal with the stuff that he deals with ... So we go over to the thing.  They're pulling him in a million different directions.  They're screaming at him that he's got to get out to his seats, because this thing's  live.  You know, this event's going off live.  They're screaming at him.  You got to get out there.  He didn't give a fuck.  He stood there and paid attention to my kids, talked to them.  You know, and Lorenzo's daughter was there. 
[03:14:00]  He's like, you look really pretty tonight.  Like, took the time to go out.  And he's a good kid.  And when he was at the fights the other night, he just ... You couldn't meet a nicer  kid, and he deserves everything he's got.  I'm getting killed on Instant Feedback already, because it's the thing to do, is to just hate  on the kid.  I love to hate this kid.  But Brother Weez is like, I'm telling you, take another look, see this fucking movie,  and he goes, and be the cool guy that doesn't just hate him just to hate him.  Exactly.  That's what it is, man.  People just want to hate this kid.  I met him once.  We did Chelsea.  I'll tell you this.  I met Justin Timberlake. 
[03:14:30]  Douchebag.  Nice.  Fuck Justin Timberlake.  Wow.  What happened?  It was another thing.  We were out with the kids, and he just ... Me and my wife were standing there, and I guess  my wife had said to him, hey, Justin, would you ... And the way that he acted and the way  that he was ... I'm not being bitter, because all my kids are there or whatever, but there's  guys ... I know how I am with people who love the UFC.  Listen, I'm not buying any fucking Justin Timberlake records.  You know what I mean?  The kids are.  So when you see people treat kids like that ... I've met them all from ... The Black Eyed Peas 
[03:15:00]  are all cool guys.  There's so many cool guys.  Fuck Justin Timberlake.  He's a douchebag.  Did he not meet the kids?  Or was he ... He couldn't have been a more arrogant prick.  Yeah, he really was.  Yeah.  Wow.  He is.  And you know.  You know when someone's just being a prick.  Oh, yeah.  There's no doubt about it.  At this point, you just know.  Yeah.  Did he know who he was?  So you want to hate somebody.  Hate Justin Timberlake.  Not Bieber.  Not Bieber.  He's a good kid.  Did he know who you are or no?  Who?  Justin Timberlake.  I have no idea.  Oh, you don't know?  Okay.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter who I am. 
[03:15:30]  We were in L.A. for the Nickelodeon Awards, right?  This thing's the hottest ticket in ... Kids' Choice Awards or something like that.  Hottest ticket in L.A.  Every swinging dick in L.A. has their kids there and wants to get their kids backstage.  Nobody goes backstage, man.  They don't let anybody go back there.  But I'm friends with the Black Eyed Peas.  They got me back.  There's four kids.  It wasn't like there were 4,000 kids and he had to stop for hours. 
[03:16:00]  There were four kids back there.  Could have cared less.  Fuck Justin Timberlake.  Yeah, I've never met him.  And the thing is, he seemed like he'd be a nice guy.  He's a guy I would have thought would have been a cool dude.  I agree with you.  I agree with you.  And Bieber, I met once very briefly.  We took a picture.  And he was at ... I did an Adam Carolla's podcast at Caroline's and he was actually at the show  recently.  But they left.  So they'd touch his arm and go, Biebs.  I think it might have been a little too raunchy because the minute I got up there, they started  asking me about massages.  And I'm just doing my thing, man.  I'm not thinking about who's ... I know he's in the audience, but I can't. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  And there's 400 people there.  So I think it probably wasn't appropriate.  Young guy.  You forget that he's only 17 years old, 16 years old.  He's not fucking 30.  But he seemed to be into the fight.  He was sitting right at the cage side watching the fight with, I guess, his father.  Yeah.  And he seemed to not be politely engaged.  He really seemed to be enjoying the fight.  Right.  Well, it was a good night of fights.  I mean, even if you don't like fights, it'd be tough not to like those fights on Saturday  night.  It was great.  I mean, every fight was good.  The Faber fight, I mean, Uriah was in before and he felt that he won. 
[03:17:00]  I don't know.  I kind of thought ... I didn't say this to him, of course.  I kind of thought that Cruz defended his belt, although I thought it was close.  Did you agree with that or no?  Yeah.  I thought the fight was closer than the judges had scored it.  Right.  But the problem is, the problem is in scoring a fight like that, that's that close, you  know, when they have him losing, what one judge had him lose in almost every round, it could  be, you know, Cruz wins by this much, wins that round.  You know?  But it was a tough fight to score.  I want to add to that. 
[03:17:30]  He wasn't bitter about the loss, though.  No.  Faber thought it could ... You know, he thought he won, but he understands why ...  Faber's a stud, man.  And at the press conference, you know, both Faber and Cruz were awesome.  He said something interesting in the interview, saying that the judges are, at times, behind  what the fighters know.  Oh, there's no ... There's fucking millenniums behind what the fighters know.  So, believe me.  So, how do you solve that?  Because, obviously, we know you enough that you're trying to get the best judges possible  for your sport.  It's not me.  It's the Athletic Commission. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, I see.  Okay.  The Athletic Commission's picked the judges and referees.  And it's been a battle that I've been fighting for a long time.  The problem is that we're overseen by the Athletic Commission, too.  They oversee the fighters and the fights, and us.  They regulate us.  So, the fact that I'm so obnoxious about my opinions on the judging and the reffing,  it doesn't put me in a good position with the Commission, either.  But, I'm going to be honest, and what I hate to see is I hate to see these fighters who 
[03:18:30]  work so hard and sacrifice to win these fights and lose because a judge or a ref doesn't know  what the hell they're doing.  That drives me crazy.  The fighters are nuts, too.  Oh, God.  And they just know they ...  Yeah.  It just sucks the heart rate out of you, man.  You know you won the fight, and it's tough.  Is that going to change anytime soon, do you think?  I hope so.  I'm trying.  Right.  I'm sure.  I'm sure you are. 
[03:19:00]  When is Jose Aldo fighting again?  I asked Favre that, too.  I think of all the guys I've watched recently, he's the one that, to me, strikes as someone  that could go for a long time before losing.  Yeah.  No, he's nasty.  This guy's so incredibly talented, and God, when is he fighting?  He's fighting soon.  In the next few months.  But, yeah.  I agree with you.  I think that this guy, right now, in my opinion, Anderson Silva's the pound-for-pound greatest  fighter, not only in the world, but ever.  I think this guy's the best fighter in mixed martial arts history.  Even though his last fight, I think the last fight he went to, he just barely, he submitted 
[03:19:30]  No, you're thinking of Chael Sonnen.  Chael Sonnen.  I think the Chael Sonnen fight makes him even more legendary, you know?  Okay.  And nobody knew until after the fight that he went in with injured ribs.  Oh, right.  And then fights that whole fight, the way that it went, and then pulls off the submission  with a minute 30 left in the fifth round.  His last fight, though, was that front snap kick to Vitor Belfort in the first round, and  he knocks him out.  That was ugly.  Yeah.  That was like a really good kick to the face.  If I fantasized about myself kicking people to the face, that's how I would do it. 
[03:20:00]  Just a straight barefoot kick.  And then he hugged him.  I think he felt bad that he fucking hurt himself.  Yeah, well, there was a lot of animosity between those two going into that fight.  Were they like training partners or something?  They were friends, weren't they?  They used to be, yeah, back in the day.  I always wonder how guys do that.  You know there's a respect for each other, but some of them are friends, and it's like,  how do you actually legitimately punch a guy that you like in the face?  It's got to be different.  Well, that's sport, though.  You know what I mean?  It's like saying you don't want to play football against somebody that's your buddy.  I mean, you see how hard those guys hit in football.  Yeah, I suppose so. 
[03:20:30]  But you're fucking someone's face up, man.  It's different.  Well, yeah.  It's just odd because it's different.  Yeah, the object of it is to do exactly what you would do to somebody you couldn't stand  in a bar or something.  But there's this mental disconnect between that.  When it's the sport that you've been involved in your whole life, it's not about, I'm trying  to hurt my friend or this guy that I know, this guy that I like.  Because most of the guys in the UFC do like each other.  Everybody's cool.  You know, there's a few dicks in the UFC, too.  But mostly, everybody's cool. 
[03:21:00]  And everybody likes each other.  And it's about competing.  It's about training in all these different disciplines, becoming the best fighter you  could possibly be improving it, you know, against other guys that are at the top of  the food chain.  I was just going to change the subject for a second and ask the obvious, what are you  doing in New York?  Yeah.  I actually, do you know what's crazy?  I was just telling Jim this before we came in here.  I, uh, I'm sitting in my office yesterday. 
[03:21:30]  It's three o'clock.  I got to go to, uh, let's go film the ultimate fighter at four o'clock.  And, uh, I, I, I call a marketing meeting.  I go downstairs.  I'm doing this marketing meeting.  And, uh, one of my guys comes in and says, Lorenzo's on the phone.  He's my partner.  He says, he needs to talk to you right now.  So I go out and Lorenzo's like, yeah, I need you in New York in the morning.  I need you for this meeting that we got tomorrow morning.  Cause me, Lorenzo's been here for like four days and I'm like, oh shit.  It's real.  All right.  So let me, I got to go.  So I leave, I go film the ultimate fighter.  We had three fights yesterday on the ultimate fighter. 
[03:22:00]  Then I had to, uh, do all these interviews, the air conditioning.  You can't use the air conditioning in this gym while we're filming screws up the, yeah,  it screws up the sound 110 degrees and the ultimate fighter.  I was in there from four o'clock till nine.  Wow.  Yeah.  Dying yesterday.  Had to jump on the plane, flew here, landed at five in the morning.  And then, you know, I went to the gym this morning and then eight and then came here to  you guys, but I'm, I'm here for one meeting.  I have one meeting and then I'm flying back to Las Vegas. 
[03:22:30]  Who was it?  I loved, I loved fucking the, uh, the, uh, Dos Santos Brock, uh, season.  I thought that was great.  Yeah.  Well, if you like that season, wait till you see this season.  This season is so good.  Now this season's so good that I'm turning the first episode into two hours.  Wow.  We've never done that.  The first episode will be two hours of the ultimate.  Who's the guy that won last year?  I watched all the episodes.  I don't remember his name, but I know he was not liked by any of the fighters because there's  some shit he said when he was drunk.  Tony.  Yeah.  Tony.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  He, he, uh, he said something about one of the guy's sons.  Yeah.  Where's your son?  Cause the guy was having like custody issues.  But he was in a blackout.  Like, I don't think you remembered saying it.  Yeah.  No, everybody hated him.  Is he still fighting?  I still, I still get tweets from people saying, yeah, I'm never watching him fight and stuff  like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's still fighting.  Who are the coaches for next year?  Do you say it or no?  Yeah.  It's, uh, Michael Bisbing and, uh, and Mayhem Miller.  Okay.  Damn.  Yeah.  It's good.  This season's really good.  What weight?  Really good.  Uh, they weigh 85, but we're doing 135 and 145. 
[03:23:30]  Okay.  So you guys are kind of pushing the, uh, the lighter guys.  Yeah.  Since WEC has been incorporated.  Well, it's the first time that, that these guys have ever been on the ultimate fighter.  Would you have Faber as a coach eventually?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'd probably be good.  Oh, he would be great.  Faber and Cruz would both be great.  He would be great.  Hey, how happy are you that they caught Whitey Bulger?  That was pretty crazy, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, are you happy?  You didn't care.  Wait, why is he connected?  I don't care.  He's from Boston.  Oh, just to Boston.  Yeah.  Okay.  They, uh, I want to ask him about the Bruins then.  How about the fact that, that he was in California?  You know what I mean?  I was thinking this guy was in Eastern Europe or something. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Right.  He's hanging down the fucking beach in California.  The number one most wanted guy on the FBI.  Just chilling.  So crazy.  Yeah.  Go to France where they don't extradite.  Don't fucking hang out.  In LA.  He was at Universal working as a tour guide.  Could you be a little fucking, a little low profile?  It's so crazy.  And in New York, uh, MMA, once again, man, they, if they, they, they're, they're not doing  it for a reason.  It's like that this whole, there's not enough interest.  They know that's a lie.  They're just, they're just lying and I don't understand what they're doing. 
[03:24:30]  They're lying because it's basically has nothing to do with mixed martial arts.  It's the culinary union, the culinary union of all things.  Think about this.  All right.  I want, I want you guys to think about it.  It's the culinary union that's keeping us out of New York.  Okay.  Bunch of cooks.  So my partners, the Fertitta brothers own the largest, uh, non-union gaming company in  the United States, right?  So the union hates these guys, hates them. 
[03:25:00]  So what they're doing is they're using their power here in New York to block mixed martial  arts.  Now we come into a state, look what we just did in Toronto.  We were just in Toronto, sold 55,000 tickets.  Every hotel anywhere was sold out.  Restaurants, you know, the hotels, malls.  Everything.  So the people that are part of this culinary union, they work.  How about this?  How about we spent, we wrote checks, $1.5 million to union workers, to people who work, you know, 
[03:25:30]  the unions that worked on that event up there, $1.5 million to union workers.  So they're, the culinary union is spending their union members dues, millions of dollars to  keep us out of New York when we'll come in here and make these guys tons of money.  They're doing it out of spite.  Is that crazy?  It's like, it's like, it's like a lot of that union shit is, it's spite.  It's fucking spite.  Yeah.  And, and who are they, uh, who are the guys that they're, I guess these guys are afraid  if they don't go that way, they'll lose the union vote.  Absolutely. 
[03:26:00]  The, the, the politicians are worried about the union vote and the union spends a bunch  of money on their campaigns too.  So they're kind of, uh, they, that's why they say, well, it just wasn't enough interest  to bring it up.  How does that get changed though?  How does it get fixed?  They said that, you know, he didn't say there wasn't enough interest.  We made the, we made it all the way up to, to, to, uh, the floor and the, the guy who  runs it wouldn't do it.  And he said what?  He just said, yeah, we're not going to bring it to the floor.  How the fuck can a guy do that?  How, what's his name?  Can you see his name?  I mean, obviously, who is it?  Yeah. 
[03:26:30]  It's, uh, what's his name?  Uh, Silver, right?  Shelly Silver?  Sheldon Silver.  Sheldon Silver.  Sheldon, right.  That motherfucker.  I'm saying that, not saying that.  I'm saying it.  Fuck him.  He's saying fuck Justin Timberlake.  Exactly.  It's pretty crazy, huh?  That really annoys me.  I really thought you had it this time too.  We were all ready to celebrate for you.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  We did.  We made it all the way up there.  And it's not like the votes were, were, you know, the votes on the way up.  It's, it's like, uh, you know, 15 to 14.  It's like, you know, we're blowing it out.  This city's fucked up.  Yeah.  Sheldon Silver.  It's a strange. 
[03:27:00]  But he's the same fucking guy that I guarantee you will tax gouge everybody  to get more money for the city and, and block something like this, which will bring money  into the city.  I despise him.  I've never liked Sheldon Silver.  Then again, if I found out he's a fan of my act, I'd change my tune immediately.  I'd put a fucking phony on him.  Well, thanks a lot, Mr. Silver.  He seems to really love me.  I'm doing the right thing.  We allow gay marriage in New York, but not, but not MMA.  It's odd how selective.  I mean, they should both be allowed.  Of course.  And by the way, it doesn't hurt MMA that much because I can go over to Newark and 
[03:27:30]  watch it.  Jersey is getting the money, you dumb motherfuckers.  It's right across the river.  It's a 10 minute drive from here.  So I go over to Jersey and I watch it.  I would rather watch it in New York.  It'd just be great for him.  It'd be great for Dana.  Yeah.  I think it'd be nice to have a big expo here in the city.  What do you got left?  It's New York and...  That's it.  It really is because you got Boston.  New York's it.  Wow.  That's it.  Yep.  Can you go to...  Who can lobby?  Who can lobby?  How is New York the last city to allow this?  Embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  It really is embarrassing.  Sheldon Silver is embarrassing. 
[03:28:00]  Well, here's the other thing, too.  It's not like we're just talking about coming into New York City.  You know, these cities in New York that are hurting Buffalo, Syracuse, you know, Rochester,  we'll bring fight nights to these places, you know, and to these arenas.  You know, we're just thinking Manhattan.  You're right.  It is all these other places.  Albany.  Yeah, we would take this thing all over New York.  So the amount of money that they're losing out with taxes and jobs and union dues, et  cetera, et cetera, it's crazy.  So basically... 
[03:28:30]  It's a no-brainer.  ...these idiots let you guys go into Toronto and do $55,000, which is an hour from Buffalo.  Or Rochester, whatever it is.  You're right.  All that money, these people just drove across and gave it to Canada.  You dopes.  Unbelievable, right?  It's really annoying.  And meanwhile, they want to just keep taking more of my money.  It's bothering me.  Do you care about hockey?  Were you happy for the Bruins?  Yeah.  First time since 72?  Yeah.  I'm a Boston guy.  I like the Celtics and the Patriots and everything.  I'm not a big hockey fan, but yeah, it was good to see the Bruins win. 
[03:29:00]  That's a good story.  Yeah, I don't follow it at all.  I love hockey.  I just like a good game, guys.  You know me.  I like everybody.  Nobody gets hurt.  I went to that Vancouver game where they beat them, the one right before the Bruins won  back there.  You know, we've done two fights up in Vancouver.  I love that city.  How about the morons up there?  I mean, is that crazy?  What a bunch of jackasses.  They love their hockey, man.  You're going to rip your fucking city apart for a hockey game?  Yeah, they will.  It's crazy, man. 
[03:29:30]  I think it's just an excuse to act like assholes.  I just, I'm not saying that.  It's the obvious.  But they do it in LA.  They do it all over.  When the team wins, they just act like douchebags and burn the city down.  They do it, too.  They kill it.  Yeah, it's actually the last time I went to the finals when the Celtics played the  Lakers last year.  Not this one that just passed, but the one before that one, the Lakers won.  And they won.  And when we were leaving and we were getting out of there, it was scary, man.  They won.  We were going to this restaurant.  And I get out. 
[03:30:00]  And I get out of the car.  And we're going to the restaurant.  And some guy goes, Dana White, aren't you a Boston guy?  Like, no, no, no, man.  I've never even been to Boston.  Yeah, wow.  Born in Vegas, man.  You won.  Fucking calm down.  You don't have to break shit when you win.  Like, when I get blown, I don't run around my apartment and just break windows and fucking  flip my radio over.  It's stupid.  You just enjoy the moment.  You know what I mean?  You pretend it was a girl.  You fucking...  Thank you, madam.  Hey, how's, before we wrap up, what time is it? 
[03:30:30]  Is it...  Yeah, where are you at?  Oh, Jesus.  How's Brock doing?  He's doing good.  Yeah.  Is he going to fight again?  Yeah.  We're hoping by the beginning of the year.  Jesus.  He's had a rough year.  I know, right?  By the way, we finally had him in here.  What a fucking great guy.  Yeah, he is.  He's cool.  Like, when you see him on TV and all, he's intimidating.  You know that persona.  But when you sit down with the guy, he has a sense of humor.  He has his moments, though.  He has his moments.  Believe me, he's...  He has his moments. 
[03:31:00]  I understand that.  He does.  But I'm surprised.  But he is.  He's a good guy.  I have a really good relationship with Brock.  We really liked him.  Yeah.  He was.  He was a lot of fun in here, is what he was.  When are you guys coming to a fight?  I have a good sense of humor.  Dude, we...  You know, Philadelphia.  We're in Philly.  That's probably the next one I get to go to.  So, it's, uh...  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  I think that is the one my brother was talking about.  August 6th.  I think it's August 6th is our next one.  I'll make sure I'm going to tell.  I'll tell you right now.  I'd love to go to that.  I will guarantee you on there.  I will guarantee you on there.  Yeah.  And you haven't been anywhere where we could be.  Davis versus Evans.  Nice.  We got Rich Franklin versus Little Nog. 
[03:31:30]  And Vitor Belfort versus Akiyama are just three of the fights on that card.  I'll go to that.  I'm in town that week.  Are you going to do an expo down there, too?  Uh, no.  We're not doing an expo.  Oh, you know?  Okay.  No.  We went to the Philly show last time, man.  Philly loves you guys.  It was awesome.  Loves you guys.  It's a great city.  I had a blast at that show.  Which ones have I been to?  I've been to Jersey.  They love you there.  And Philly.  I think that's it for me.  You saw Anderson fight.  I've never seen Silva fight.  I would really like to go to one of his...  I know he's fighting in Brazil.  Forrest Griffin.  You should do that one.  You should go down to Brazil.  I believe I'd miss the fight. 
[03:32:00]  I'd be in a fucking...  I'd be in one of those...  I believe it'd be a problem.  We want to keep Jimmy out of Brazil for a while.  He'd be a muck in a favela.  Show me her tits.  I've been to Brazil three times.  It's like I'd never go back.  It scares me.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The availability of certain things.  It's like, you know what, man?  I'll wait until he's back here to...  What was the greatest knockout you saw?  Because we were talking about Forrest Griffin's knockout  and how he ran out of the arena.  Yeah.  One of the great...  And we love Forrest.  We've had him on a lot.  But that was a moment that I'll never forget. 
[03:32:30]  The craziest knockout I've ever seen  was a couple weeks ago on the Versus card.  Pat Berry fought Czech Congo.  Fight starts...  Did you see this fight?  No, I did not.  Oh, my God.  You've got to see this fight.  You guys have to see this fight.  The fight starts out.  They start banging.  And Czech Congo goes down three times.  It looks like he's just about to get knocked out.  And he clips Berry and knocks Berry out viciously cold.  I'm telling you, you've got to see this fight. 
[03:33:00]  He was done, and then he just came back and...  And lands that big shot.  That's what happens with the heavyweights, man, when they start swinging.  Is that online?  I'll find it.  Yeah, if you don't, I'll send you guys that whole card.  The whole card is awesome.  But that main event, it is another vicious knockout.  That one, and I think it was on the same card,  was Sam Stout and Eves Edwards.  Eves Edwards gets knocked out pretty viciously, too.  And you've got a knockout bonus now?  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  That is so smart.  Yes.  What is that about again?  We've got a knockout, a submission, and fight of the night.  That's fucking great.  Yeah, Faber and Cruz won fight of the night.  They won $75,000 each.  That's some incentives.  It is an incentive to not mail it in or to not push it around.  The guys must love you, man, in general.  Love you.  Me, I don't know.  You're probably downplayed.  They have their moments with me.  I'm sure, but...  They love me when I say yes.  They hate me when I say no.  I mean, you've got to be the boss,  but it seems like you're a pretty cool boss to work for.  Thanks.  Our boss. 
[03:34:00]  I try.  Fuck him.  Yeah, we'd love you to take over this place.  How nice would that be?  No, no, no.  He was just thinking of...  Oh, we're just doing radio.  Yeah, that's it.  Sorry.  That was part of the gag.  Maybe that was a little harsh.  Now that you guys have Strikeforce,  is Fedor going to come down at 205  and eventually fight at light heavyweight?  Can he stop fighting guys at a 380?  No, Fedor's fighting Dan Henderson.  How much does he weigh, though?  Dan Henderson's, you know, 185-pounder.  Right.  So he's...  Are they fighting in...  Fedor's fighting at 220 or is he coming down? 
[03:34:30]  Dan Henderson's going to move up.  Yep.  Henderson don't care, man.  That guy will fight anybody at any weight class.  They don't care.  Don't you think if he fights a guy like Henderson,  who's more in the weight of what light heavyweights would be,  he'll go, oh, this is probably a better route to go  than fighting guys at a 260?  Listen, I've been saying for a long time  that I'm, you know,  I'm not sold on the whole Fedor thing.  Fedor was good back in 2004, 2005.  I think what it means is  if he gets viciously knocked out 
[03:35:00]  or stopped by Dan Henderson,  now he just got beat by a guy who weighs 185 pounds.  Right, right, right.  So he's done.  You know what I mean?  He really needs this.  Yeah, I think it's a big fight for him.  It is.  But he didn't seem to look...  And even though Henderson weighs 185 pounds,  normally you'd say,  well, you know,  this guy's in a lose-lose situation.  He beats Henderson,  who's 185,  he should beat him,  if he doesn't,  but that's not the case.  People respect Henderson.  Henderson's a dangerous, tough guy  who's fought guys from, you know,  middleweight up... 
[03:35:30]  Actually, from 170 up to heavyweight.  So him beating Dan Henderson  would mean something.  Henderson has the fucking...  The scary...  Like, he's a fighting white guy face.  Like, he has...  That's the white guy  you don't want to fuck with is Henderson.  No, it's true.  He's a mean-looking dude.  He looks mean.  The thing is with Henderson, too,  is, you know,  he and I had a stint on the Ultimate Fighter,  and me and him go at it a lot, too.  But when that guy grabs on to you, man,  he's a bad dude.  Didn't he knock out Bisping?  That's one of the greatest knockouts  I've ever seen, too.  That's a good one, too. 
[03:36:00]  That one, and I think Belfort  getting kicked in the face  are my two favorites.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Any kick in the face...  You guys...  I want you guys to watch  the Czech Congo knockout  of Pat Berry,  and then check out  Eves Edwards and Sam Stout,  and tell me what you think  of those two.  Okay.  You might change your mind.  But the knockout of Vitor  was pretty impressive.  Nobody had ever seen that before.  Yeah.  It had never been done.  And I was not impressed,  by the way,  with Overeem.  I saw those fights.  Yeah.  He looked a little sluggish.  Yeah, he did. 
[03:36:30]  The heavyweights,  the strike force,  I'm not as impressed with  as I thought I would be.  Right.  It's coming from a man  who fucking does the elliptical.  I really should be  fucking mouthful.  Well, let's get Dane out of here.  Yeah, we got to wrap this up.  He said,  fuck Justin Timberlake.  Thank you very much  for coming in, too.  Pleasure.  No, thank you guys.  Love the show.  We really appreciate it, Dane.  Thanks, man.  And are we promoting anything?  Because I think we're  closing up, too, right?  Yeah, what are you promoting?  We certainly are.  We're not promoting anything.  I was here for a meeting.  Yeah, I know that.  Come to Philly.  For the people who are in New York,  since we got dogged out  in New York again, 
[03:37:00]  come to Philly.  We'll be in Philly August 6th.  Great card.  I have a lot of fucking people  down there,  so that's my problem.  We're going to need  a lot of tickets.  Let's do it.  We'll nosebleed him, though.  Let's do it.  Me and my brother-in-law,  but the rest of them  will nosebleed him.  He'll be happy up there.  We won't nosebleed you.  Come on down.  We'll have a good time.  And let Sheldon Silver know  how irritated you are  with this sickening  fucking caving in  to the culinary union.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't give a fuck.  He will, though.  If enough people  contact him, 
[03:37:30]  he will care.  I hope so.  Can I have some more  pepper on that?  Fucking assholes.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Later, guys.  Thanks. </pre>
