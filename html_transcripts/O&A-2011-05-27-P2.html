<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show featured Flavor Flav as a guest in studio.  Following Flav's departure, the "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment focused on a physical fitness competition between E-Rock, Troy, and Bobo.  E-Rock won the competition, which included push-ups, sit-ups, running, and dips.  However, the judging was heavily disputed, particularly the push-up portion, with Troy repeatedly accusing E-Rock of performing "girl push-ups" and a caller, CokeLogic, corroborating his complaints.  Bobo's poor performance was attributed to a pre-competition "carbo-load" consisting of two Whoppers, fries, a Coke, and two Monster Energy drinks, compounded by getting lost during the running segment. Despite threatening to quit if he lost, Bobo remained on the show.  The segment included numerous humorous exchanges, notably Troy's repeated use of "brother" after meeting Flavor Flav, resulting in amusing interactions with the other hosts.  Bobo's heavy breathing into the microphone was also a recurring comedic element.  The competition’s outcome sparked discussions about E-Rock's past behavior and his apparent positive transformation.  There were also several mentions of internal staff tensions, including a reference to Kenny's anger.  Flavor Flav's presence prompted comments about Troy and E-Rock’s appearances.  The segment concluded with post-competition banter and congratulations for E-Rock.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Bobo Show.  Yeah, that's right, this is the, well, according to E-Roc, this is the Bobo Show.  What the fuck are you doing?  I don't, I don't know what to call this.  What are you doing?  Um.  This is not the Bobo Show.  Well, I know that, this is after Owen A Live with Sam.  That's not what you just said.  Well, well, I didn't know.  And what's this music?  Journey with me into the, I like the song. 
[00:00:30]  Me too.  It's a great song.  I know every word to this song, Troy Klein.  You can respect that, can't you?  You're still pissed.  Eric, what are you playing?  This is the Bobo Show.  Ever since you won this little contest, which, by the way, I have a problem with you winning,  uh, you've got a big ego.  A big ego.  You can make these decisions now, huh?  Ego recognize ego, is that what it is?  Are you getting lunch today?  No, I'm not.  Why?  I'm fucking lost.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live, no matter what the music is. 
[00:01:00]  Bobo, I'm not mad at you.  I know that.  I'm Sam Roberts, your host.  Of the Bobo Show.  Bobo's still, yes.  The Bobo Show, hosted by Sam Roberts.  Uh, Bobo is still hanging out for God knows what reason.  Bobo, you were sitting on that couch the entire time the Flav interview was going on.  Yeah, that's right.  What'd you think?  Well, I was still trying to catch my breath from the competition.  You didn't do anything.  Well, it was still an exhausting competition.  I guess.  I mean, I'm actually feeling okay.  Uh, Troy, competition aside, let's talk about Flav for a second. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  You're an old school hip-hop guy.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Old school public enemy fan.  Yeah.  Uh, Eric, see if the people on there calling in have anything worth talking about.  Sure.  Okay.  Um, were you excited to have Flav in here?  Yeah, I love Flav.  I think he's great.  I'm definitely, like I said, old school public enemy fan.  And, uh, I think Flav's the fucking man.  You got to go in and do the liners with him.  Like, when we have people go, hey, this is so-and-so, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  You do anything special with him?  Yeah, we had him do some rapping.  Why?  I don't want to say what it is, but it's cool.  It's something fun and different, so.  Who's we?  Uh, D-Boy and I were back there.  You got to work with Flav for Flav?  Yeah.  Rapping?  Yeah, I was coaching him on his raps.  You were coaching him?  Yes.  Was it a dream come true?  Uh, it wasn't as easy as I thought it was going to be, but, uh.  You thought you'd just be able to kind of read off the paper and boom?  Yeah.  Oh.  Somebody's on the hotline.  Yeah, thank you, Eric.  Um, but it was a little difficult? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, yeah, but, you know, he's the man, so.  You can just do whatever he wants, really.  But we got some good stuff.  D-Boy and I are going to be putting that together, so.  I love that.  Yeah, I like that you two are finally teaming up.  It's a beautiful thing.  Uh, oh, wrong mouse.  Uh, Bobo, you're breathing very heavy into that microphone.  He's excited.  Everybody can notice.  Um, we have to go to the phones because Roland is on the phone.  Roland?  Yes, Troy's boring me.  Okay.  Well, I'll take that into consideration.  Yeah, ask him after when Flav left. 
[00:03:00]  He went, yeah, thanks, brother.  Troy, did that happen?  I said, thanks, brother.  You know, like, thanks for...  Wait, wait, wait, what?  So, Flav is leaving the booth.  Yeah.  And what did you say?  I said, thanks, brother.  Why did you say, thanks, brother?  You never say, brother.  I do.  No, you don't.  Okay, would you monitor everything I've ever said in my vocabulary?  I've known you for years.  There you go.  Troy's not boring me anymore.  Now he's fighting.  Yay, Troy.  I've known you for years and you've never said, brother.  Well, you're not black.  That's what you say to black men.  Thanks, brother.  Well, you know, that's my people.  All right, Rowan, if you want to talk, come into the studio. 
[00:03:30]  You're still here.  Okay.  All right, bye.  Coke Logic, you're on After Opie Anthony Live.  Hi, Sam.  Hey, Coke.  Hey, I was Team E-Rock all the way, not because E-Rock is just one of the coolest people, but  I was certain that Sneaky Sam Roberts was going to have some sort of giant swerve where  you were going to make E-Rock overwork himself and then just stand aside or something, but 
[00:04:00]  what the fuck happened?  You just didn't compete well.  I did compete well.  Number one, you ask anybody that was in the room at the time an unbiased opinion and they  will tell you that every single push-up I did was better than any push-up E-Rock did  and the reason that he was able to complete push-ups literally two to three seconds quicker  than me is because he was doing girl push-ups.  He was doing half push-ups.  He was not doing full push-ups. 
[00:04:30]  And with-  But you lost.  And with that-  You lost three out of three.  No.  Because if I should have won the push-up contest because some of those push-ups should not  have been counted because I saw his shirt was going towards the ground, but he's a  very fat person and he had a large shirt on.  So, of course, that's going to hit the ground like nothing.  He was barely moving his elbows.  You know, he's barely flexing them.  And so with that said, I should have won the push-up contest.  That would have meant, and then the other events are the other events, but that would  have been one point for Bobo, one point for E-Rock.  I absolutely annihilated and dominated the running competition. 
[00:05:00]  I mean, I destroyed everybody running.  And Troy even-  Well, Bobo got lost.  Well, Bobo did get lost.  That's true.  Somehow he came out of the Fox building, which was next door.  Yeah, I don't know exactly where Bobo went, but I won the running thing.  I should have won the push-up thing.  With that said, that's two for me, one for E-Rock, one for Bobo.  This was Sam's competition, and there was some judging that I have issues with in the  push-up contest.  You fucked up. 
[00:05:30]  You lost.  Just accept it, man.  I didn't fuck up.  Thank you, CokeLogic, for nothing.  Bye-bye.  I mean, dude, what a fucking disappointment, man.  You talk so much shit, Sam.  You talk so much shit.  And you just didn't step up to the plate, man.  I did.  Did you see the push-ups?  I'm going to tell you something.  I'm bummed I lost the money.  I'm not going to lie about that.  But I am happy that Eric finally can say, look, I fucking beat you at this, dude.  But he hasn't said it.  Well, he can.  And he knows it.  He knows it.  And by the way, simply running around the block, not only did he lose, he fucking quit. 
[00:06:00]  Well-  He didn't even finish running.  That is true.  He fucking quit.  I crossed the line.  I just walked it.  You didn't cross the line.  You cut across.  You quit.  You know you did.  I stopped running.  I walked the rest of it.  And then you cut across instead of running all the way around the block.  Yeah.  He already won.  Because you quit.  Nope.  I mean, in his defense, look, he did win.  So what was the point?  Yeah, I mean, the judges say he won.  He won.  Yeah.  One thing we can all agree on, no arguments for anyone. 
[00:06:30]  This is the Bobo show?  Is that Bobo didn't come close to winning.  No, not even close.  Bobo, what happened today?  You were very confident.  Was it the two?  Now, Danny, this talked about a little bit on the air, but what happened was Bobo got here,  and our own Danny, Danny Ross, not Danny Bobo, Danny Ross told Bobo that it was important  to carbo load before, you know, a physical fitness challenge, and he asked Bobo if he  wanted some breakfast.  Bobo said yes, and Danny went ahead and purchased two Whoppers, an order of fries, and a medium 
[00:07:00]  Coke, which Bobo consumed all of, as well as two Monster Energy drinks before the competition.  Bobo, why didn't that breakfast help you?  Well, I knew it was going to help me somewhat, but I knew mainly, I knew the running part I  wasn't good at, sit-ups, sometimes I feel I've got it, and sometimes, I mean, that's  tips, I mean, push-ups, I felt I've got, I sometimes get, I don't know if I've gotten 
[00:07:30]  it right.  Yeah.  Dips, I've never really done before in my life.  Well, you've never done them at all.  You didn't do them today.  Yeah, exactly.  Dips, I didn't, I wasn't, look at it, I've never done it before.  Yeah.  Running, I ran before, I've jogged, but I don't, I'm not really so good at competitive  running.  I don't know what that means.  Kev, you're on, uh, after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, uh, you were, you were saying that E-Rock stopped, uh, the running competition, but 
[00:08:00]  didn't you not finish the sit-up competition?  Here's what happened with the sit-ups.  I'm doing sit-ups, and I said, I didn't say E-Rock.  E-Rock should not have won that competition.  I said that I'm not going to continue doing sit-ups because I know that I will not beat  E-Rock's time.  I could do 20.  Is that the same thing as him?  No, because this is a competition with many events.  The running is the last event, so there's no reason to quit other than, you know, you're  a quitter. 
[00:08:30]  Or that I'd already won by that point.  Well, I mean, some people like to really win, and some people quit.  You should have, you shouldn't have allowed me the point.  I wouldn't have allowed you the point.  Didn't matter if you got the point or not.  Kev says congratulations, E-Rock.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you, Kev.  The fact of the matter is, you couldn't step up to the plate.  You talked a lot of shit, and you fell short.  And you know what?  Honestly, I mean, it sucks to lose the money, but I'm really happy for Eric.  Now, there is, I got to tell you something. 
[00:09:00]  I was thinking about some of the things I said.  I should have mentioned that I do not have a strong core while I was, you know, hyping  up the competition.  Right.  There are some things that I'm not as good at, and I listened to some tape.  I thought I had mentioned that, and I guess I didn't for that.  You didn't.  So what you're saying, I'm sorry.  It is your fault, right?  What is my fault?  That you didn't give me the proper information that you should have.  So then I think, because of that, you should repay the money to Anthony and I.  Well, first of all, that's up to E-Rock.  He's got the money. 
[00:09:30]  Second of all...  No, you, out of your pocket.  He won.  That's his money.  He won it.  Look, Troy, you both know that we're in the same boat here.  I don't have $250 to my name.  What am I going to, you know, make it appear?  Am I going to grow it from the ground?  Pull it out of your ass.  I'm going to have to borrow it from E-Rock if you're going to get the money back.  He's got it.  And he had it before the competition, too.  But the thing about it is, I feel like more valuable than any of this is the lesson  that if you're going to gamble, don't do it above your means.  Like, gambling can be a fun thing to do. 
[00:10:00]  But if you don't have the means...  But with the shit you were talking...  Yeah.  It sounded so confident that this was going to be a wash.  And it did.  Look, I'm happy for Eric.  And I'm glad he finally has this over you.  And I see a real turnaround for Eric.  You do?  Yeah.  I got to tell you something, Troy.  The past couple weeks, there's a new E-Rock.  I think this is...  I mean, to be honest with you, I think this is a great time to be Eric Nagel.  Yeah.  Because, like we discussed on this show the other day, when he didn't want to do the competition, 
[00:10:30]  under any normal circumstance, you know, up to not including this last month, but any  time before that, over the last six years, anything Eric didn't want to do, Opie and Anthony  said, no, Eric, you are doing it.  But even today, Opie says, so, is Eric doing the competition?  They gave Eric the choice.  Like, if Eric had said, fuck you, I'm not doing it, and he might have, they wouldn't  have made him do it.  Right.  But he stepped up to the plate.  He did.  He handled his business, and he came out victorious. 
[00:11:00]  So I'm happy for him.  It's a great time to be Eric Nagel.  Yeah.  And Eric, he needed this win bad, because he's never wanted anything in his life.  A hundred grand.  Except that's true.  He took Troy.  That's a biggie.  Yeah, you weren't around, but you've heard about it by now.  I've heard all about it.  He took the newspaper that was sent to the studio.  That is not what happened.  Eric did.  They sent a daily news to the studio.  That's the bullshit that the show spews, because they feel that they're entitled to  money.  Oh, I heard it on the air.  And this was before I was working for the show, to be fair.  And Eric decided to take it upon himself to take the paper that was sent to, you know, the 
[00:11:30]  whole show, take the lotto card out of it, enter that into the contest.  He won $100,000, kept the money for himself.  Well, honestly, I don't think anybody on the staff would have done anything different,  to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Including myself, because that's a tough one, man.  Speaking of the staff, I mean, honestly, usually, I am either heavily involved or behind  most of the shit that goes on here. 
[00:12:00]  Between Opie, Derek, Kenny, and Danny.  Kenny, right, for that five minutes before, I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  I have no idea where that came from.  Kenny.  Kenny's got fucking venom in him, man.  Look, I don't, I, I, I, I joke around with Kenny, I wouldn't want to be on his bad  side.  I don't know how people get there.  Right.  To tell you the truth, don't know how people get there, but I know when they're there,  they're, they're deep.  When he's angry, man, he looks fucking angry.  I don't think, I don't think the people that are on Kenny's bad side always know how they  got there.  Right.  But Kenny's got, Kenny's got reasons behind everything. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what they, I honestly, this, and I tell you the truth, you at home, I  tell you the truth.  I'm, if nothing else, I'm honest.  Except when I didn't mention the weak core strength.  Right.  Beyond that, I'm honest.  I have no idea what that was.  And when Kenny's angry, he will stay angry for a long time.  Yeah.  There was a time where I, I had noticed that his hands were a little dry.  They were a little chapped from the winter.  Oh my God.  That's right.  You put some lotion.  I took lotion and I, I was telling him, look, you need hand lotion.  You need hand lotion.  He kept saying no, and I forced hand lotion on him and he didn't talk to me for three 
[00:13:00]  months.  It's very strange.  The, the big show is on the phone.  Big show.  That's the name.  You're right, Sam.  I'm calling you out.  You're full of it and full of shit.  Go Iraq because look, he proved you wrong and you were talking shit.  Well, you were the king.  You ruled the studio.  Well, uh, you're wrong.  That is true.  To be fair.  Thank you.  Big show.  To be fair.  Look, check the tape for the pushups.  And I'm very surprised that in May of 2011, the fact that I talk a lot of shit is news 
[00:13:30]  to everybody.  Yeah.  Well, you gotta understand, like when, when you do what you do and you do it well, but  when you talk so much shit, people are just so excited to see you fail at something.  They want you to fail so bad.  Your picture.  Oh, okay.  Hang on.  You doing a Flavor Flav picture?  Yeah, I gotta get it.  Let me know how it turns out.  Bobo, you had a, a roller, first of all, yeah, Eric.  Oh, you're going to take a picture?  Oh, he's going to take a picture.  Bobo, you had a, a roller coaster of emotions today. 
[00:14:00]  You came in, ready to work out.  You lost bad, correct?  I mean, you were running around the block and literally got lost.  Nobody knew where you were and you didn't know what happened.  All you had to do was run around the block.  You had a rough one.  You didn't win the competition, correct?  You lost.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Um, you come back here and Opie, Anthony, and Jim let you know, they remind you that 
[00:14:30]  you bet that you would leave the show forever.  You're still winded a little bit, huh?  Yeah.  Still catching your breath.  Um, you put so much emotion into your reasoning as to why you want to be on this show, listening  to this show.  I mean, you were crying, correct?  Yeah, that's right.  And that's okay, because you show emotion for the things that you love.  You love this show.  What was it like to hear the news that you were allowed back on the show? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, it was a great feeling.  It was, it was a breath of fresh air.  That's the best I could say it.  Yeah?  Just a breath of fresh air.  Just a relief.  Now, is there any part of you that thinks, why do I like coming on this show?  Because I end up getting abused all the time.  Oh, because I, I don't, I don't take, I don't take this too seriously.  It's for the bit?  Yeah, exactly.  I know this is a radio show.  This is all done, this is all done for the show, all right?  Right.  And you're in on the gag. 
[00:15:30]  Exactly.  Right.  Um, did you think you were going to win coming in today, or did you kind of know there's  no way you were going to beat me or E-Rock?  Well, first of all, I, I didn't even come here not even knowing what was going to happen,  all right?  I just knew one thing.  I, I think I told you guys this already earlier.  I, I said I almost backed out of doing this competition.  I almost not, I almost didn't get up.  I almost decided to not, not, I'd go into competition. 
[00:16:00]  E-Rock, what's going on in the hallway?  We're waiting on, uh, Flaif to leave Shave 45.  Oh.  He's in there, didn't Who Kid just go in there with him?  Um, there was two different interviews with Shave 45 that they're doing.  So I think he's doing this one right now, pauses, and then comes back and does another  interview.  Oh, oh, so you're hoping in between the two interviews he comes out?  Yeah, well, that's what we were told, so we're waiting.  People have been looking at me, uh, through the glass, but because I'm still wearing my workout  gear.  Yeah, you look ridiculous.  Well, I mean, I thought we were all coming to show up. 
[00:16:30]  You know what I mean?  You know what?  I'm going to say something here.  Say it, Rock.  And I've said, I'm going to say this to Bobo, because I've stated, you know, Bobo drives  me nuts.  Yeah.  I like Bobo as a character, but he drives me nuts at times.  But the fact that Bobo beat both of us by one, well, he beat me by one second, Sam  just kind of gave up.  Well, I say I conserve my energy for other events.  The fact that he did all 30, correct, or 20, correctly, and beat me by a second, I 
[00:17:00]  got to congratulate Bobo on that.  Congratulations, Bobo.  Thank you.  And then you were also going to say something about the running, too, right?  Right.  Well, what I was going to say-  Not you, Bobo!  It's his show!  Eric, weren't you going to say something about, you know, the running?  The running didn't matter.  What do you mean it didn't matter?  It didn't matter.  It was already an afterthought.  It was just one of those things that we had to do.  The running was-  Because it was the last event that, you know, that was paid for.  I still say the running should have been at least two points.  The running was the most energetic event there was. 
[00:17:30]  I mean, Eric, you're still out of breath.  Bobo, you're still out of breath.  I'm fine.  I saw you breathing hard.  Bobo.  I was breathing hard, but I'm fine now.  Yeah, but Bobo's going to collapse.  But that was from the running.  Yeah?  And I destroyed it, the running.  You sucked at everything else, so big deal.  No, no, no, no.  You won the event no one cared about.  Right, Bobo?  Right.  Yeah.  How dare you, Bobo?  Well, I don't know what to say.  Tell him to go fuck himself, Bobo.  All that shit Sam gives you every day, tell him to go fuck himself.  Now's your time. 
[00:18:00]  It's your show.  I'm not going to say anything negative about anybody right now, all right?  All I'm going to say is every part of the competition mattered, and I said not competing  in any of the competition.  So, Troy, how'd you do with getting a Flavor Flav picture?  I think he's in there with Who Kid.  We're still waiting, yeah.  I'll get it, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, he's, I think, but I think Who Kid, like, just went in there, so he might be a  little early to wait outside the studio.  Yeah, all good.  Plus Rollins.  Who's that?  An intern for...  Don't say it, don't say it, don't say who that. 
[00:18:30]  Okay, it's an intern.  Yep.  She's attractive.  She's an intern for a different company.  She's one of Flav's interns, I think.  Very nice.  Um, the mashup hasn't seen me in my workout outfit.  I was just telling E-Rock that people are just really giving me odd looks in this workout  outfit.  Yeah.  You look good, though.  Thank you.  You look like a champion, even though you're not.  So, I'm sorry, dude.  That's a shitty thing for you to say.  Well, E-Rock, for real.  Dress for the job you want, right, Sam?  That's right.  Exactly.  Bring back the lunch club today, buddy. 
[00:19:00]  Nope.  Why?  Fuck you.  You have $249 in your pocket.  That I do.  First of all, you should give me $75 for the push-ups.  No.  Why?  Because you lost.  I shouldn't have.  You did shitty push-ups, Eric.  Coulda, shoulda, woulda, didn't.  The judge said I won.  I wish Mars was in here, because I take real big on bridge with that.  Can I have half back?  Give him his $49 back.  All right.  Just half.  If Eric gives you the $49 back, you got lunch?  No.  Fuck no, dude.  Come on, dude.  I'm so pissed at you right now, man.  Like, dude.  You just, you didn't deliver. 
[00:19:30]  You wrote a check.  Your ass couldn't cash.  I think you're going to get your Flavor Flav thing, so you get the fuck out of here.  Well, what about Bobo?  Bobo, you...  Because we were nice enough to let him back into the fold on the march.  You going to take care of lunch for us?  I didn't bring money with me.  I mean, if I did...  Do you have a credit card?  Bank card?  I didn't bring money with me.  I just had the MetroCard to come here today.  If I would have had money, I would have gladly paid for you guys.  Oh, there's Flav. 
[00:20:00]  Right behind you, Bobo.  See?  See?  Taking a picture with Troy.  Oh, Eric.  Oh, he almost got denied.  That was so close.  Everybody's trying to get pictures with Flavor Flav now.  Eric almost got...  Flavor Flav!  Did he hear me?  I think so.  Yeah, boy!  Yeah!  He's funny at me.  He's laughing.  He knows what's up.  He's in his own world, man.  Yeah, well...  Flav's in his own universe.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  I think we're supposed to wrap up, but what happened?  What happened?  So the door...  Is this on?  The door shut as you were going, yeah, boy.  And he's going, yeah, kid in the building.  He's pointing.  And he goes, what the fuck's with that hat?  Look, Flav, you're telling me I look weird?  Yeah.  Fuck out of here.  Oh, he's signing all the autographs now.  And what the fuck is Eric wearing with those shorts?  I don't know, man.  But he's the winner.  He can do whatever he wants.  I guess so.  The fuck is with that hair?  Fuck Flavor Flav. 
[00:21:00]  I'm just kidding, Flav.  I don't know if you can hear me.  Yeah, boy!  Eric's not manning the board, by the way.  No.  I mean, I think we're running into Ron and Fez's time, but there's nothing we can do about it.  Eric's more concerned about his autograph right now.  What's going on?  Thanks, buddy.  Flavor Flav!  Who signs the...  The door was open.  Who signs the cover of a book?  Look, like...  What did he say?  Peace what?  Peace boss.  That's what's up.  Yeah, but he usually signed the inside, right?  The inside, yeah.  The little dust jacket he signed.  Sorry, your autograph isn't perfect, King. 
[00:21:30]  I'm just saying, who signs...  I've never seen anybody sign a book like that.  You always sign it in here.  Well, Jim, I know, asked him to sign the cover, because Jim likes to display them.  Ah.  But yeah, you usually sign it on the inside.  But like you said, Flav is...  He's in his own world, man.  ...off somewhere in his own world.  Then why not?  Why not?  Yeah.  You know, the Flav interview almost didn't happen.  I know.  Anthony tried to make a run for it.  He tried to.  That was on the air, too.  You gotta listen.  It was quite a show.  I mean, it started off just sounding like a regular show.  But right around 8 o'clock, 8.30... 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Things just got crazy.  Things got crazy.  Yeah.  Because we started the physical fitness challenge.  Then, you know, and that was insane.  Bobo almost got fired.  He cried until we let him back on the show.  And Bobo, you made it back, buddy.  And then he gave me a thumbs up.  And then Flavor Flav came in.  Obi was long gone by that point, though.  Plus the weird staff tensions that kind of got brushed over with everything else that  was going on.  I'm sure at some point something will come of that.  Maybe not. 
[00:22:30]  But tune in to the replay at 3 p.m. Eastern.  It was definitely, though, a Friday show.  It feels like a Friday show.  How'd it go, Eric?  Made my day.  What did?  Fuck with that hair.  Why?  Yeah.  What's his problem?  Yeah.  That's adding insult to injury right there.  I don't know.  I feel...  You lost the fucking event.  And then Flav just dissed your hair, so...  You were outside.  Did you see me running?  You did.  But you fucked up on everything else.  Talk about the running.  Yeah, fine.  Am I strong runner? 
[00:23:00]  You still lost.  Am I a strong runner?  Yeah.  But, dude, you weigh three pounds.  There's no...  Why take it away?  Huh?  I'm rolling.  You're such an ass.  He can hear me yelling.  Because he wants to hurry up.  You go, Flavor Flav...  And he stops and he goes...  Yeah, boys!  And then he goes back to like...  Like, what do you need?  Did he like it, though?  Oh, he loved it when he did that.  Good, good.  I want to make Flavor Flav happy.  You're welcome, Troy.  It's just not...  The thing he's...  Listen...  Yeah, exactly.  Roland, you're the fucking man.  I know, I just buzzed you off.  No, Roland looks up everything, man.  He's a good dude. 
[00:23:30]  Eric said...  But Eric said that Flav looked in here and pointed at me, and then he said,  What the fuck is with that hair?  No, he said, What the fuck is with that person?  Oh, he said person?  No, he said hair.  I thought, he doesn't know me like that.  I know, but the second time you go, Flavor Flav, and then he stops and looks and he goes,  Yeah, boy!  Are you glad Bobo's back?  Fuck with that.  No, I wish he was gone.  I'm going to listen to Public Enemy all afternoon.  P.E.?  Can't trust it.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Eric, we got to go, right?  But he did have a flashback with a picture from their Halloween party. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  Yeah, someone wants to come in and talk to you, Sam.  Okay, come on in.  He's coming.  Who is it?  Huh?  Sorry.  Sorry.  It's Liam.  That's not exciting.  Liam, I thought this was going to be like a fun surprise.  It's just you.  What happened to you?  I almost want to...  A do-rag?  It's not a do-rag.  It's a t-shirt sleeve.  It's a do-rag.  It's the sleeve of this t-shirt I'm wearing.  I'm wearing it around my head.  It makes you look black.  What, is that such a bad thing?  No.  Why don't we get Mr. Flavor Flav in here and ask him?  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  That's what it sounded like.  So, what happened? 
[00:24:30]  Because I heard that E-Rock won, which I'm very excited about.  I was rooting for him the whole time, and you and I thought about this the other day.  Right.  Well, I mean...  Real quick, because I know you've got to go.  Yeah.  Basically, there were four events.  Sit-ups, E-Rock won fair and square.  Mm-hmm.  Fair and square.  And push-ups, he won fair and square.  Wait.  Dips.  I don't...  Eric, did you get the...  Who got the point on dips?  I did.  I beat you.  Oh, wait.  No, no, no.  Bobo won sit-ups fair and square.  Yeah!  Bobo!  Bobo won sit-ups fair and square.  Technically, E-Rock got the point on dips, but Mars, you just came in here. 
[00:25:00]  I mean, nobody probably should have won the...  We were all terrible with dips, correct?  Mars did three dips as a demonstration.  And they were better than anything we did for our entire set.  Trains.  But I have to...  He's an MMA fighter.  Thank you.  No, I'm not.  I'm trying to be.  You're a little long in the tooth for that, but go ahead.  Exactly, exactly.  That's why I just pretend to be an MMA fighter.  Yeah.  But the push-ups that Eric did, they were official.  They were.  They were not as low as you, but we were talking about low.  He just had to...  This was the problem. 
[00:25:30]  I did the push-ups first.  I went first with the push-ups.  I did picture-perfect, beautiful, 20, fast...  Fast, beautiful, all the way down, all the way up, all the way down, push-ups.  Great.  But you couldn't go past 20?  That was the...  Oh, that was the...  It's like the army, though.  They don't go all the way down.  Right.  But then, Eric...  He chose a bad technique.  Eric, because he saw what I did and had time on his side, did half-sees.  Well, that's called competition.  Did half-sees.  Okay.  That's who you're saying.  I don't believe you. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  No, you could say...  His push-ups were nowhere near as good as mine.  He did a different technique.  They weren't as good.  They still were official.  Were they as good as mine?  No, they were not.  Does it matter?  That's not the point.  The point is that we could get officials to say he had to break the plane, which is he had  to do this, make an angle with his elbow.  A couple times, he didn't really make an angle.  Yeah, he did.  A couple times.  So he won.  And then running, I destroyed running.  Of course you did.  You destroyed running.  Of course you did.  We all said that you would.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  Because I'm a good runner.  Right.  But...  So what did E-Rock win? 
[00:26:30]  He won push-ups?  He won...  He won...  Dips?  Technically push-ups, and then he won dips.  He did three, and I did two.  Wow.  And $250.  And he got Troy's 50, and Opie's 200.  Yeah!  E-Rock!  Woo-hoo!  E-Rock, today's your day, buddy.  You're the man!  But there's one thing.  Bobo's back, so we're all losers.  Oh, yeah.  Aww.  Wait a minute.  Oh, wow.  On that note, we gotta end.  Bobo, congratulations.  E-Rock... 
[00:27:00]  Thank you, Sam.  All right.  More on.  E-Rock, good impersonation, Roland.  E-Rock, we'll never end with all those mics on.  Today is your day.  Yes.  Congratulations to the sex man.  Thank you.  I'm sure you'll have something to give away on Twitter to celebrate.  This has been...  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  Yes.  Episode of Kenny on Facebook.  Everybody follow E-Rock Radio, because he is the winner of the day.  Also...  Congratulations.  No, Roland, you're not getting it.  Your mic's not on.  I turned it off.
