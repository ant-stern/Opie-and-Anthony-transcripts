<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Spinning Wheel of Hate" segment targeting Bob Kelly.  Pat from Manaki's prank, involving exposing his anus near Bob while he read a blog, escalated to placing Bob's phone against Pat's buttocks for a photograph, resulting in Bob's vomiting.  This was followed by a prank on Danny, involving a false dress code for a meeting with Tom Giasano, the general manager.  The resulting discussion centered on workplace pranks and staff dynamics.

Next, the show featured a phone interview with Tucker Max, author of "I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell."  The interview, plagued by significant microphone issues requiring multiple fixes, was filled with sexually explicit anecdotes from Max's life, prompting listener reactions ranging from disbelief to shared experiences.  The technical difficulties added to the comedic chaos.

This was followed by an aircheck of an older E-Rock radio show, highlighting his earlier, less polished style and repetitive phrases. Opie and Anthony critiqued his performance, discussing E-Rockâ€™s career.  Another "Spinning Wheel of Hate" segment targeted Roland, featuring a prolonged and uncomfortable rectal examination (for comedic effect) by guest Dr. Steve, in exchange for Roland choosing three future guests.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Tucker Max's book and a reaction to the "Foot Fist Way" trailer.

A "Jocktober" review of Sam Roberts' Sirius XM show dominated a significant portion. Opie and Anthony played clips of Sam's show, mocking his voice, jokes, and persona with offensive language and a "joke horn."  They compared Sam's show unfavorably to an unnamed Nebraska show and criticized a planned "Battle of the Sexes" segment.  "Club Soda Kenny" was presented as a positive contrast to Sam's style.  The segment culminated in a listener-initiated "Baby Diaper Mustache Day" challenge, resulting in Opie being smeared with baby feces, causing widespread disgust and vomiting.

The show then transitioned to Opie recounting a text from his girlfriend, contrasting it with his own response regarding her potential death.  This led to promotional announcements and a humorous recounting of Opie falling asleep on air, with the staff leaving him asleep at the microphone.  A significant portion focused on Jim Norton's refusal to attend mandatory sensitivity training in Washington D.C., leading to a debate with ELO, Opie, and Anthony.  The segment concluded with a heated exchange between Steve and Danny regarding Danny's negative attitude towards driving Poe's dog-smelling car. Laszlo was mentioned as having gone on a camping trip with Danny.

Finally, the show began with a discussion of an ongoing feud between the hosts, transitioning to a darkly humorous scenario involving a disgruntled employee with a rifle, with Eric repeatedly being the hypothetical target.  A Pal Talk pajama party featuring several women, including "Stalker Patty," was discussed, detailing the events, including photo shoots and wrestling. Poe's alleged security role at the party was met with skepticism and jokes about his motives and behavior around women. The show ended with the "Spitting Wheel of Hate" tagline.

[00:18:30]  all the time  anyway  why are you  dressed like this  yeah  I know  but I only found out  around 515  this morning  this is a bit  of brilliance  on the part  of other people  um  yeah why are you  dressed like this  oh because  I was told  that we actually  are going to be  having a dress code  implemented  around here  listen to Ben  Ben's in charge  look  I love when Ben  laughs uncontrollably 
[00:19:00]  because then I sit  there and go  but Ben you're  the one in charge  and all hell's  breaking loose  around you  now Danny  who told you  there was going  to be a dress code  everyone  everyone being  uh let's see  Ben  Ben  Steve  Steve  uh  Thanimal  Van  and uh  and uh  and the newly  shaven Travis  Travis  yeah well Derek  well because Derek's  the one that blew  the whole gag  in the first place  that's what gave  me an inkling  that this was  a whole thing  did you go  uh oh 
[00:19:30]  what happened  because dumb  Travis goes  oh I can't  really  dumb Travis  who's dressed  like he dresses  every day  as opposed  to you  he's like  I can't really  talk about it  call Derek  but they failed  to fill Derek  in yet  so when I  call Derek  he goes  what are you  talking about  and then all of a  sudden I just  hear silence  and then  oh that  oh yeah  dude everyone's  pissed  but it's already  too late  and obviously  you weren't  completely sure  because you're  dressed really  nice today  well you know  when you hear  from eight  different people 
[00:20:00]  it's like  I guess I'll  see what's  going on tomorrow  these guys  bust balls  behind the scenes  constantly  there's pranks  and hijinks  going on  all the time  it's a daily  gang rape  that you  consistently  show up to  Anthony and I  leave like  minutes after the  show's over  every day  and that's when  the fun really  begins with these  guys behind the  scenes  the plotting  and the planning  they're just trying  to get each other  all the time  yes  Than  now did you  smell bit  before or after  you went  pants shopping  yeah because 
[00:20:30]  we found out  that he doesn't  own this  he doesn't  own anything  he had to go  out and get  nice clothes  yeah you know  he bought  slacks  went to the  store bought  some slacks  slacks  he bought  slacks  and the shirt  and the shirt  what did that  set you back  well luckily  I'm frugal  I shop at  TJ Maxx  ah okay  I was going to  guess the  Sears Roebuck  how much  like 50 bucks  50 bucks  probably not  in a position  where you  could just  throw away  50 bucks 
[00:21:00]  no not really  that's my  kind of bill  no not really  by the way  Rob from his  mobile device  it's radio  a-hole  why would it  matter what  you're wearing  that's what  I'm thinking  the whole time  I'm like dude  this doesn't  make any sense  I knew it was  but then I  show up this  morning and  I'm like and  Steve's wearing  his you know  his regular  workout attire  and I'm just  like showing  those guns  let me guess  this doesn't  apply to you  guys  oh no no  I gotta be honest  Steve is the  only one that  thinks about what  he's gonna wear  before he gets  in here  yeah but not  in a business  like way  no  in a way to  show off his 
[00:21:30]  arms and tattoos  right  and how big  he's getting  he's all about  showing off his  arms  yeah  boy  he's all about  dressing like  Freddie Mercury  I have not  seen that much  chest hair  in my life  Freddie Mercury  he's gotta shave  like up to his  neck like he's  got a neckline  shave where the  chest hair  I think he has  a barber's chair  and some old man  comes in with that  leather strap and  that straight  straight razor  yeah  so uh  airs him up  down to his  navel  well this all 
[00:22:00]  started with an  email we're gonna  like have a  meeting soon  just to see how  everything's going  yeah  you know  see how it's  going back on  commercial radio  and all that  and that's when  Ben and the gang  decided this would  be a good time  to kind of  screw down  yeah like a  meeting with the  bosses to go  over any of  our needs  because then you  asked what the  meeting's about  and they said  something like  Tom is not  happy about how  people are dressing  around here  yeah it was  like part of  it  something like  because Tom  is always so  well dressed  Tom is like  dressed to the 
[00:22:30]  nines every day  suit tie  like fitted  suits  guys got  like gazillion  dollars worth of  suits  and and you're  kind of  intimidated  uh walking up  to him dressed  like a slob  probably  I would think  I would think  if you're then  told that there's  going to be a  meeting involving  Tom about a  dress code that  you're then thinking  oh my god  this guy wears  like suits  that cost  thousands  I gotta go to  TJ Maxx and  pick up some  slags  yeah I mean 
[00:23:00]  plus you know  I guess they did  a good job of  filling everybody  in on it so  you know no  matter who I  called  they all know  yeah  but here is the  major flaw in  their problem  I mean obviously  I guess the  major flaw  as you're sitting  there in brand  new clothes  that you went  out and bought  yesterday afternoon  the victim  is sitting there  the major flaw  he's dressed like  he's going to  a PTA meeting  major flaws  you fell for  the entire thing  I say it's a  minor flaw  yeah what is the  little tiny flaw  the thing that  made me think 
[00:23:30]  something was awry  so to speak  was that  no one could  give me  a story  like it was  all very very  but you didn't  have enough  confidence  that's perfect  for this crew  because no one  ever has the  story in this  crew  it's always vague  yes somebody  look at him  trying to downplay  it you're in  brand new clothes  you didn't have  enough confidence  to come in  dress like you  usually dress  you thought  in the back  of your head  that this  could be real  so I better  dress appropriately  plus it's a lot  harder to get  eight people  on the exact  same lie  so just keep 
[00:24:00]  it vague  and then the  stories don't  get tripped up  oh a little  roll of the  eyes from Danny  I saw that  he's very pissed  let me tell you  there's going to  be hell to pay  because this  all goes back  and forth  so now Danny  is going to  come up with  some retaliation  he's plotty  you can see  it's  it's all right  by the way  once in a while  somebody just  makes an ass  out of you  it just happens  Bert from Philly  again he's a 
[00:24:30]  regular  dress to the  nines  is that a  1940s reference  what the F  does that mean  dress to the  nines  23 skidoo  he's dressed to  the nines  and smoking  Lucky Strike  cigarettes  in his  brand new  slacks  always have  a pack  of Lucky's  or Chesterfield's  in the  pants pocket  of my  slacks  Anthony had  his first  drink at  a speakeasy  yeah  I had  the right 
[00:25:00]  knock  the thing  opened up  was payback  going to be  a bitch  there Danny  well probably  not since  you know  the little  sewing circle  will never  get on my  side  he's like  he's like  naked man  he's just  alienated  from public  is there a  click  well than  comment  little sewing  circle  is there a  click going  on  it's forming  I think of  you guys  all as the  same  pieces of 
[00:25:30]  crap  like there's  no hierarchy  when I look  at you  you're all  equally  worthless  to me  well thank you  Anthony  no problem  not as far  as work  goes  I mean of  course you  guys do  your job  you do it  very well  as far as  just your  worth in  life  and how it  affects me  and my  life  again not  through work  just in  life  you're equally  Travis  you are the  same piece  of garbage  as Than  as Danny 
[00:26:00]  it just  doesn't matter  to me  well there's  clicks but  they're always  shifting  like for instance  two days ago  we locked  Travis out of  the office  and it  posted false  comments from  his MySpace  account  was he  looking in  watching  in horror  I wasn't  happy  and about  after about  25 seconds  he just goes  oh he gets  the okay  bits over  stop messing  with me  look  and that's  when it gets  even more  fun  that's when  it's supposed  to get  more fun  that's when  the joke  begins  there's 
[00:26:30]  something  every day  I mean  there was  one day  who was it  that sent  out the  MySpace  bulletin  that such  and such  was getting  married to  Poe  that was me  yeah that was  Travis  that was me  that was  getting married  to Poe  that was a  good one  hey by the  way Tim in  California has  a good  observation  Tim what's  up  hey what  are you guys  doing insulting  about half  of your  audience  by saying  we all  look like  dirtbags  our audience  dresses like  Danny's dress  today  of course  of course  I just  don't have  a chain  drive wallet  that's about 
[00:27:00]  it  it's  it's  called  dressing  comfortably  you're very  comfortable  all right  just  just take  the joke  Tim  come on  and what  they do  also is  they'll  they'll  leave  you  come in  you're so  funny  and just  and it's  one of these  idiots on his  email just  typing  so I'll  type back  something  you know  hey that  sounds like  a great  idea  you know  let's  make a  date of  it  see when  your  calendar's  free  and if  I'm not  shooting  myself in  the face  that day  I might 
[00:27:30]  be able  to make  it  something  like that  so one  day they  left  Danny's  open  and typed  something  I can't  even remember  what it  was  but I  was so  pissed  that day  I just  wrote  F off  on the  thing  and used  the entire  word  and for  like a  day and a  half  two days  thought I  was mad  at him  because I  didn't add  some witty  little thing  it was just  F off  so I'm  thinking  oh man  maybe this  is finally  the day  I thought  I'd change  it up  a little  bit  alright  we're gonna  break and  catch up  a little  bit  so 
[00:28:00]  Danny  alright  yeah  I'm just  waiting for  tomorrow  maybe I'll  switch my  coffee with  decaf  or something  find out  who gets  annihilated  next  as the  worst of  Opie and  Anthony's  spinning wheel  of hate  continues  welcome back  to spinning  wheel of hate  I'm your host  Roland  time to  spill the  wind again  time to  spin the  wheel again  and see

[00:30:00]  is fine  but cunt  like a cunt  sniffing  is unacceptable  ah  you got it  you got it  alright  so what's the book  about  it's your life  basically  a bunch of short  stories about  stuff that  happened to me  I mean  I'm just an average  20 something  idiot that goes  out and gets  drunk and does  stupid shit  except I just  write about it  that's pretty much  it  one time I  hooked up with  this girl  and went back  to her place  and she was in  the bathroom  we were done  she was in  the bathroom  you know  like peeing  so she wouldn't  get a UTI 
[00:30:30]  and I had to  throw up  I was so drunk  and I couldn't  you know  like I couldn't  go in her  bathroom  so I just  threw up  under her bed  and then  and then  so she came  back you know  she came back  out and we  started hooking  up again  and the next  thing I know  I'm hearing  this jingling  noise  and I'm like  what the fuck  is that  and so I  stop  I think it's  you know  like the bed  moving  or you know  from sex  and then I  stop and  she's like  the noise  is still going  and she's like  oh that's just  my dog  he always licks  himself when  you know  when I'm  having sex  and then all  of a sudden  I'm like  oh my god  he's not 
[00:31:00]  licking himself  he's eating  the vomit  so there I'm  like you know  having sex  or fucking  I guess  when I'm  I'm fucking  this girl  and the dog  is like  I almost  couldn't stay  hard  I had to  I had to  focus  normally you gotta  you know  focus to  like to  hold it in  I had to  focus just to  stay hard  I had a chick  this is true too  not long ago  she was blowing me  and I fucking  like when I  when I come  you know how it is  when you  like if I grab the ball  and you fucking  push your hips  and I'm a shooter  like I like  I fucking  blast  and I fucking 
[00:31:30]  crammed it  and I hear  and I've never  actually had it  happen  all over my  fucking  balls  and on my bed  dude did she  it's in the book  and she's like  I'm sorry  she's like  I'm sorry  I ate a muffin  before I came  I had a muffin  all over me  no the best  the best  my favorite  blowjob story  I got two  favorites  one is  this girl  took me  you know  like back  to her place  she was like  kind of chunky  but she kind  of had that  look like  you know  she could  suck the fuck  out of you  you know 
[00:32:00]  so  so we go  back to her  place  and you know  I take off  you know  pants  and we're  sitting on  her sofa  and she's  blowing me  it was like  unbelievable  like the type  of blowjob  makes your  ankle sweat  you know  and so she  gets up  like afterwards  I guess  to go wash  out her mouth  or whatever  and I stand  up and you  know put my  pants on  and there's  a huge skid  mark on her  white sofa  from me  I didn't know  what to do  you know  because like  the worst part  was like  you know  like she comes  out of the 
[00:32:30]  bathroom  and I'm like  oh my god  and so I  couldn't flip  the sofa  like the cushion  in front of her  so you know  so I sweep her  up all romantically  and carry her  in the bedroom  I kind of had to  lug her in the  bedroom  and then you  know after  I hooked up  with her four  or five times  or whatever  until one of us  passed  or she passed  out  and then I  went and flipped  the cushion  after she was  asleep  a big fucking  brown skid mark  that or the  time that  one time this  girl burped  like you know  she swallowed  and then burped  wouldn't it  have been funny  if when you  turn the skid mark 
[00:33:00]  cushion over  there was another  one on the other  side from some  other guy  facing the other  way  that would be  great  alright let's  go to Brett  in Boston  Brett what's up  hey Opie how's it  going bud  hey  so this guy  Tucker Max  I guess he's got  a website right  I've read a bunch  of his stories  but they're the  ones that are  just on the edge  of believable  but if they're  true he's a stud  so Tucker can you  tell the story  about your  Tucker  no I don't know  I don't know  I'm like look  she wanted to be  a runway model  that's why she 
[00:33:30]  was living in  South Beach  I was in  Florida at the  time  and I'm like  it's what all  the models do  blah blah blah  and so I  finally convinced  her by convincing  her that it was  the European way  to have sex  this is the level  of intelligence  of this girl  and so anyway  but she's like  you have to take  me to a nice  dinner and it's  got to be like  a production  so I take her  out and we go  to some restaurant  Tantra actually  and I spent  like 400 bucks  on this girl  on dinner  and you know  two like good  bottles of wine  and whatever  so she's totally  ready and we go  back to my place 
[00:34:00]  and what I hadn't  told her  you got to remember  I was like 20  I think 20 or 21  at the time  and like I'm kind  of an asshole now  but I was possibly  the worst person  on earth at this  point in my life  so what I hadn't  told her was that  my buddy and I  decided that since  this is going to be  the first time I've  had butt sex  that I wanted to  videotape it right  but instead of just  like setting up  like a camera  this is like nine  years ago  so it was before  like you know  like really cheap  cameras we had  like one of the  like the sort of  shoulder ones  right right  that had like the  VHS sort of like  that except the  crappy version  right right  and so my buddy 
[00:34:30]  hid in the closet  with the camera  and was going to  film us like  so he was hanging  out in my place  and then he saw  us pull up  and he was going  to go run in  the closet and  hide and so I  was so shit faced  by the time that  I got back  at this point I  had pretty much  forgotten that he  was in there  so we go in  we start kissing  whatever and then  you know like  she's like okay  I'm ready and so  I bought like you  know one of the  big industrial  like this size  of like Astroglide  like it's like huge  because I didn't  know what the  fuck do I know  about ass sex  you know and so  I'm figuring well  you know a little 
[00:35:00]  bit's good so more  is better so I  basically just  now here I am  filming this girl  but at the same  time I'm thinking  okay you know I  don't want to hurt  her anus so I  pretty much like  uncap it and just  stick it in her ass  and just squeeze  and I emptied like  half the bottle  because I'm thinking  you know you gotta  put enough in to  make sure because  I don't know how  much it takes  what do I know  right and so  and so this is  like pretty much  pre-internet porn  you know and  like I thought you  could just spit on  your dick and you  know like no that's  like that's only in  porn movies right  yeah that's the  prison way right 
[00:35:30]  so I fill her up  with this stuff and  then of course I  slide right in no  problem and everything's  going great for a while  and you know and we  start going harder and  harder and she's more  into it and I'm more  into it and like I'm  right about to come  and you know I'm  slamming hard come way  in and out and I come  out too far and I kind  of like you know I  come out and I like  you know hit her butt  or something so I go  down to put myself  back in and all of a  sudden I feel this  like warm splash on  my hand and it's  and I'm like what  the lights are kind 
[00:36:00]  of low so I look  down and it's like  kind of dark and I'm  like wait a minute  and then the smell  hits me shit all over  my dick and it wasn't  just like poop it was  like dire like watery  diarrhea fucking mix of  like diarrhea and  astroglide and and so  like the smell hits me  and it was like oh  my and then of course  I realized she shit  on my dick and then  combine that with like  the seafood and the  two bottles of wine and  I just I blew all over  her ass like in her  asshole everywhere and 
[00:36:30]  so I'm throwing up and  she's like kind of  hammered so she like  turns out she's like  Tucker what are you  doing she sees me  throwing up she goes  oh my god she starts  throwing up everywhere so  I'm seeing her throwing  up and it's making me  throw up I'm throwing  up more all the sudden  true fucking story my  fucking buddy falls out of  the closet and he's  like oh my god because  he saw us and smell you  know smelled it I mean  you can imagine the  smell you know it's like  seafood and wine and  astroglide and shit and  he fucking is throwing  up everywhere so like 
[00:37:00]  there's like a three  second period where all  three of us are staring  at each other vomiting  everywhere that video  would be like I know  you know you have no  idea how upset I am I  don't have that I know  and so anyway so she  like you know of course  freaks oh I thought you  love me I can't believe  throws you know the  sheet like puts it  wraps the shit and  astroglide stain sheet  around her runs out of  my apartment like leaves  her clothes everything I  still to this day don't  know how she got home  like I called her you 
[00:37:30]  know three or four times  are you okay whatever  she ended up changing  her phone number like  the girl who introduced  us like you know she  wouldn't return her  calls I don't know how  she got home but yeah  it was I didn't get my  deposit back in that  apartment either we  couldn't we couldn't get  the smell out we tried  for days it was  disgusting you're a good  boy let's go to Steve  in Houston Steve hey  what's going on boys  hey Steve hey Tucker  Max holy shit you are  the king shit your stories  are some of the funniest  shit I've ever heard

[00:38:30]  role model for little girls  so I wrote a story after like  you know a month of this I  wrote a story just the true  story about our relationship  and I used a real name and I  never ever used real names  except for my own and hers  was the only one because I  was just calling her out as  being a hypocrite and so she  sued me and lost it she  ended up we removed the  case of federal court and  they ended up withdrawing  their claim because they  were going to get smoked so  I mean I won but it was  like it wasn't like a big it  was a big deal that like you  know the case at first  because it was like a  internet landmark whatever

[00:45:00]  fellow angry what's up  Tucker what's up fellas  boy hi um Tucker I came  across your website um  when I was wipe off the  screen lol no I yeah I  always I came across your  website when I was looking  for absinthe online did  you tell them about  driving into the donut  shop yet uh no it's it's  I mean like I can't tell  the whole story I hear  that I mean it's it's like  uh 18 pages in the book  I basically I got shit  faced on absinthe and uh  and this girl and I was 
[00:45:30]  like really drunk and this  girl was she's like oh I'm  too drunk to drive home you  gotta drive and I was like  all right so I ended up  driving her home and then  she like had me drop her  off at her like apartment  building and she's like  we'll go find parking  place and when you find it  then come up and I  couldn't find a parking  spot and I was fucking  pissed off at her so I  ended up like parking you  know I I found a spot and  it was like uh kind of too  small but I was still  trying to cram the car in  there and I ended up  jumping the curb and like  running the back of the  car into a a donut shop  and like crashing the  window down and shit and 
[00:46:00]  so then I just pulled I  got all scared so I just  pulled the car off and  like parked it somewhere  and threw the keys like in  the bushes and then like  went home I didn't even go  up to her spot yeah so um  I mean like this you got to  read the story  when you condense 18 pages  right into like it's not  it's funny yeah a sentence  was there ever a police  report um no dude I  looked and looked and  looked and uh I never  found one I remember one  time I was in Colorado  back in like 96 and I  was fucking horny and um  yeah Boulder right and I 
[00:46:30]  just I'm like fuck I'm  like in lakes I don't know  even Colorado and I went to  a Christmas party and then  I snuck back that night and  I went downstairs and I had  my way with a little girl  and then I snuck away and  nobody ever figured out  what happened I just hear  some another tragedy just  befell that family  well uh let's uh let's go  to Nathan horrible let's go  to Nathan and Jericho 
[00:47:00]  hey man what do you say  Nate welcome aboard hey  Jerry I love you buddy how  you doing all right listen  Tucker I just wanted to  thank you because um it's  really nice to see  somebody actually document  some of the crazy stuff  that goes on this this  stuff does happen and uh I  think most of the time it's  really just it's likely to  happen when you pay attention  to a girl and uh I don't  think a lot of guys realize  that you're able to do a lot  of the stuff once you  actually listen to her she'll  pretty much let you do  whatever you'd like yeah I 
[00:47:30]  mean whatever like that's  what I always tell people I'm  like if you plenty of people  have stories that are just as  funny or just as cool as  mind they just don't write  them down I mean like if  you think about it it was  just a crush I don't think  anyone would call the cops on  that all right let's uh let's  go to uh Kyle in Michigan  Kyle yeah hey cat the lucky  Louis star Jim Norton hi  Kyle thanks for calling the  program get to the point 
[00:48:00]  Max have any good gay or  funny stories yeah we do a  segment called gay or funny  and people call in with  their stories and then we  decide if it's a gay moment  or a funny moment both being  kind of gay but one the humor  in it is so much that it  takes the gay away like an  example would be and we've  all seen this like a guy  doses off at a party right and  a bunch of guys stand around  with their hogs in his face and  you take a picture it's kind of  gay but it's more funny so the  funny overrides the gay when he  wakes up and sucks them all then 
[00:48:30]  becomes hot or funny  lol  fucking silly goose  cut it out you give me those  ribs and no one calls the cops  no one does  I've got one um this uh I  didn't really realize at the  time like when I was living in  South Florida I ended up like  hooking up with whatever dating  this one stripper and she was  you know like tall and big fake  tits and she couldn't lubricate  on her own she's a pussy but  couldn't you know which some  girl happens to some girls but  um it turns out that uh like  one of my buddies uh is gay he

[01:03:00]  why don't you go grab my cell phone  because he saw  he saw the book fly against the window  tell him to call from out there  get him on the phone from out there  before you start  oh is that uncomfortable  you know what  I mean  god bless him  but  I mean  he doesn't have the videotape  of one of the most amazing stories  if it's true  the kid fell out  what happened 
[01:03:30]  he fell out onto the tape  I didn't hear what happened to the tape  what happened  because like  that would be something you would want  it was  you know  it was the old days  where it was the big  yeah the clunky VHS  the guy fell out  when he was vomiting  and everybody was vomiting  and it broke the tape  yeah and then Monty Python  stole it  made a sketch  really did they  but what  I like the subtle stuff  oh no police report  really  hmm  interesting  what  does it  hey 
[01:04:00]  E-Rock  hello sirs  hey E-Rock  we're outside here with  with him  Tucker  wait  with Tucker  yes  we got a bunch of people on the phone  that were like  kind of  not calling you out necessarily  but some of them were uncomfortable  yeah we wanted to  we want to allow you to  defend yourself  I also want to make sure  we left on good terms  and stuff  because you kind of  looked a little bummed  when you left  yeah we don't want a  James Fry situation here  so we want you to  you know 
[01:04:30]  to defend yourself  is everything cool  I was just in the studio  they want to talk  to him  he doesn't want to talk  he said if he wants to talk  he'll come back in the studio  well we can't have any of that  they're just making sure  everything  you know  and is good  everything's cool  what happened  yeah we just want to make sure  everything's cool  what happened  okay  well  he told me 
[01:05:00]  to go fuck myself  and walk in the elevator  and he's just sitting there  with the middle finger  as the door shut  E-Rock's got balls  E-Rock is great  alright E-Rock  thank you  beat it stupid  E-Rock's had a fine day  with this program  wow  look  oh he's pissed huh  yeah is he  is he  he's embarrassed  we're not talking  you got your friend  videotaping  and he's going to  fall out of the closet  and break 
[01:05:30]  it has to break  through the camera  then the VHS tape  has got to be ruined  and that's the only reason  you don't have a tape  dude I was rolling  at that story  and if you ever had  a tape like that  you would never tape  over it or anything  when he said  he puked on her back  I could almost go  it went too far  once she started puking  it's like  do you understand  the type of fucking  awful radio we do  like come on man  we're not frat guys  and then everyone  started puking  everybody's puking  and I got it  the dog started puking  and the bird flew in  and it was puking  and then my friend  rolled out of the closet  he's puking  so then I'm puking  and then where's the tape 
[01:06:00]  and then she runs  out of the room  with a sheet  covered in shit  and shit and puke  and wraps it around her  and she blows off her clothes  and he crashes a car  into a donut shop  and there's no police report  and he just throws  the keys in a bush  and leaves the car there  yeah  bullshit  that was a little bit  over the top  you should have left  that stuff for the book  but if you knew  who you were talking to  as far as  the believability 
[01:06:30]  you would have kept it  to a minimum  and just went  what was obvious  it was fun at first  and then when he told  that story  I felt it in the room  everyone was getting  really uncomfortable  like somebody's gotta  call him out on this  funny and started going  did ya  would ya  I was just reading  pal talk  and all they were  printing  all they were typing up  was  I wanted him to  unplug his headphones  because when he  unplugged them  I was just saying  you are so full of shit  and he couldn't hear it  it's so funny 
[01:07:00]  just fucking with people  alright  oh wait  what is this  what happened  on Jim from Philly  we weren't able  to read any of this  oh  well it's still up  it says  Jim what's the pad data  what was going on there  Jim  Jim  hey what's up guys  hey  what was going on  in the pad data  it just says  Tucker Max lying  it could have been  more fucking accurate  it was fucking awesome

[01:08:00]  Opie throws the book  at the window  right at the moment  where Jimmy said  Tucker  so he turned around  right at his book  as his book  hit the window  that he was looking at  that was great guys  love you  he was pretty pissed off  alright thank you  alright let's go to  JW from Jersey  JW  good day shit dick  hey  good day  yes sir  he would have been  more credible  if he would have went  ta da  at the end of  every one of those stories  ta da

[01:32:30]  not have to clear them i think roland's  scared that he's gonna make comesies in  his pants  no jeez  can i make it three guests and we'll do  it now  okay i say yes three guests over a  period of  oh no no no but they'll be all they'll  be named guests i show we'll all know  he's playing us  no no no he said three right now i say  he's playing us  no i say three right now but now wait a  minute we can't have three guests in  like a week  no no no it's gotta be spread over four  months how long four or five months 
[01:33:00]  three guests of his choosing but we  said two you're going to three so now  we  this is a bargaining thing now he  checks you for a hernia too  yeah dr c's got a mic dr c's putting  the glove on  you know because this is what he  requested uh from the show when it  comes to new york he says hey you know  my thing is to  to stick fingers up he's double gloving  it  two gloves  all right what do we got steve i'm  ready steve you gotta talk us through  okay so the first thing you have to do my  friend is assume the position which is  to put your elbows on the  now put put your uh he's already

[01:34:00]  going in hurting it's going in watch  that face it's going in right now  oh stay out of the way here we go you  ready oh it looks like a one eye one eye  he's turning into pops roland perfect  absolutely normal how was that  roland it was the most awkward thing  ever  i'm gonna go home take a shower  his ass is a little big so i could only 
[01:34:30]  get in about one knuckle  oh wow but it was enough and i've got  long fingers but it was enough to feel  you got a totally normal prostate all  right  yeah roland get over here yes look at the  beads of sweat on his fucking forehead  and jimmy i gotta got jaundice i gotta  start by saying i was wrong to roland  he gave me this movie uh called foot  fist way it's a movie that what will  farrell uh discovered uh yeah somebody  slipped it to will farrell and he 
[01:35:00]  washed it him and adam mckay and he  bought the distribution  jimmy was right i will explain in a  second what the fuck was that jimmy  was horrible uh foot fist way you gave  it to me i didn't really know what to  make of the movie i have honestly  resisted watching it but i i shouldn't  i'm annoyed at will farrell because you  didn't call in last time that's kind of  stupid i mean i admit that but um i don't  know that the main character of foot  fist way is terrific he's like a master  poe type character yeah this is his 
[01:35:30]  thing who think he's all that so what  is your synopsis of that yeah what's  foot fist way all about it's like um  this is all we're gonna do on xn today  it's like the dog boy laughing at the end  of the commercial all right what  rolling foot fist way um he is like a  the master of the demo uh he plays  fred simmons and a real guy or is it  like a character okay it's his character  and uh  he's he's simply adorable yeah 
[01:36:00]  foot fist all right go ahead and uh  it's just it's really funny though his  sayings and what he does what's he say  it's like truman capote  jesus christ it's that water coming  right out of you and the movie's getting  really good reviews and i like i said i  didn't know what to think of this  yeah and it's uh  is a very ticklish boy he certainly is 
[01:36:30]  jimmy goes to me we got to get rolling  in here because and i don't know how  you knew this but you you told me that  when you tickle roll in he makes silly  noises sounds like a girl scouted a  funny movie i actually i discovered it  accidentally what do you mean really i 
[01:37:00]  missed and hit his taint i think fast  yeah in the xm studios rolling right  now his forehead he looks like he's  testifying at a child pornography trial  jesus you are sweating i'm a wetback are  you all right yeah i'm a mexican wetback  you're a wetback but that was because of  the swim over the rio grande somebody  sprayed pam on your forehead  what are they cooking up some eggs for  everybody on your forehead  i don't know  oh wow so what do we should what should 
[01:37:30]  we do with foot fist way now i'm thinking  we got to support this guy in the movie  he should call in he's really funny  dude will he come in or no um he's  filming in la okay by the way his wife  in the movie worst actress ever  ever just a friend obviously she's never  done acting before it's so not  believable when she's on screen with the  guy the guy's hilarious though how he  talks to his students and everything  yeah and his character is pretty funny  because he does uh  and bigger uh stronger faster got uh 
[01:38:00]  great reviews 100 percent uh positive  reviews on rotten tomatoes so far  the steroid movie yeah yeah i want to  see that that one and we interviewed the  guy he was he was a lot of fun that  one and the fist fist way are the top  two musty movies yeah  this is our new bit  fucking movie reviews with laughing  rolling oh write it down 
[01:38:30]  we start we do this weekly now  it'd be funny if you did it while he's  reviewing like shinla's list  exactly and then he said they have  little hands they can clean the  munitions  did you see sex in the city rolling  uh i did not  why not you see every movie that  comes out i'll i'll see this week and  but i want to go see foot this way  again  yeah and we got to keep him in here  because now the sweat is dripping into  his eyes and it's fucking i've never  seen anybody's spot like this looks  like  it looks like  boston garden in 1986 i'm with you 
[01:39:00]  nick i'm with you but the but the guy  say he'll definitely he will call into  the show  yeah get you're right on mike there  with your sweaty forehead get him a  headband oh yeah it's going into his  eyes holy shit is it stingy yes look  no one else is sweating is this  aerobic exercise for you  roland wears like fucking short  sleeve shirts it's literally 30  degrees out and he's bumbling down  the street  yeah in the winter he'll wear that  yeah he'll wear that in the winter  he's never cold  no but he gets hot he doesn't own a 
[01:39:30]  winter coat i did you just say that  i'm sorry no i'm staring at this  fucking crane across the street  wondering when it's our turn i know  what the fuck we have one of these  huge cranes literally hanging right  over across the street right behind  anthony's head and if that thing fell  like the one that just fell on the  upper east side here in new york we'd  be fucked it would fucking the sound  coming out of that thing would be like  it's the crane operator you know can we 
[01:40:00]  do like uh i don't know i'm thinking  like an all-out can we put you on the  floor with microphones maybe allow the  listeners that showed up today to  to tickle you for like 10 seconds no  they're begging rolling they're  begging no you're very ticklish come  on we'll end the tickle bit with you  just getting tickled by like 10 dudes  no  that's awkward it is awkward how about  just one dude how about master poe  ew no who do you want to tickle you  yeah  how about sam sam looks like he's a  good tickler who would you like to 
[01:40:30]  tickle you  you don't have a choice um jimmy i  guess okay but jimmy's been  tickling you can he sit on your belly  i can see my reflection in his  forehead right yeah it really is a  fucking mirror roland also turned me  on to surf wise which was amazing  uh the heckler what what was the best  movie you've seen in the last couple  weeks  as probably is the foot fist way  foot fist way it sounds dirty there  hasn't been i mean there's been okay 
[01:41:00]  movies do we have a trailer for foot  fist way just to maybe give people a  little taste there's a red band  trailer on youtube yeah all we have to  do is click and go  yeah all right let's give it a shot  foot fist way the trailer  all right hold on let's turn this off  right now you're sucking last august a  film was slipped to will ferrell and  adam mckay do you think y'all can  handle this  taekwondo is a deadly serious killing 
[01:41:30]  system since then they have watched it  at least 20 times it's the best of all  martial arts i hear jiu-jitsu is really  good for balance  no jiu-jitsu sucks they can't wait has  breast the size of a female they  obsess over it you like to party i'll  give you a call mr simmons i really need  to go practice my wow you just feel that  what i mean we totally just connected  right there  and now they want to share it i'm 
[01:42:00]  noticing that a lot of y'all are just  throwing single kicks and punches  what you need to be doing is following  those through with some combinations  block with the right distracting back  fist and spin crescent kick got you  didn't you rick no i was just doing  what you told me to do i think marge and  i know different don't we marge yes  sir you come with whatever you got full  contact i don't think you're gonna like  how this ends hot shot  we just knocked out the old lady  oh shit 
[01:42:30]  holy shit  she's still alive yeah  the trailer would have been more  enjoyable but they put that stupid  movie music in there like they keep  stopping the sound yeah but the red  band trailer is better because it has  cussing and everything in it oh i don't  like cussing  has cussing has cussing 
[01:43:00]  but they show more of it here's a  question i would like to ask roland  yeah just look in the camera too  what is your favorite curse  what's that about come on oh that  it is so ridiculous people out there  are gonna think that you're putting it  no he's not it's when i was a kid my  brother used to torture me just kind of  so ticklish and just kill me to death i stand in the same way but you still have the laugh as in a  adult that you had when you were six where are you ticklish most yeah i don't know just around it just i'm ticklish your arms ticklish no your nipples just my stomach area is like ticklish i don't know why yeah 
[01:43:30]  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh gave a lot of good tickling  it's the cutest sound ever  it really is you might just hold them and i know  then you realize he's sweaty  penrest  and then you prefer not to  look at him sweat 
[01:44:00]  no it's awful  it'd be funny if every time someone tickled him he came  sounds like he might be  uh trailer sucks movie is awesome  i don't really know what to think of foot fist way  it might be like a napoleon dynamite it gets better the more you watch it or something  it does i saw it five times already  five times  five  yeah  all right  well rolling  that's like what crazy people do  uh  watch a movie that many times  saw the mic  don't hurt him 
[01:44:30]  yeah he's away from the mic  there's no need to do it once he's away from the mic  look at this  oh wow  oh yeah  oh that  that little laugh was fucking masquerading a killer inside  i know  no rolling doesn't play  no  rolling through his headphones at poe  god may the crane fall on your head and kill all your head  wow  wow  let me tell you something about rolling  he looks like  oh  oh  oh  oh  what's this world coming to

[01:51:30]  shows now  no i'm not  picking shows  and you got  caught  your show  was nominated  by many virus  fans  by the way  guys  the guy  that's making  fun of you  sam roberts  is wearing a  lady gaga t-shirt  i'm a fan  but i don't  have to sing  a song about  it she sings  the song  we got to  get a little  bit of sam's  does good  radio  where's a bit  of sam's  break  it's burning  right now  we're uh  we'll have it  a second  we're burning  it uh  for you 
[01:52:00]  but sam  does good  radio  every copy  of every  friggin minute  to cds  these guys  refuse to do  radio with  the whole sam  they don't  refuse they  just haven't  been told  to yet  they would  do it  freak show  actually no  sam actually  there was one  day they put  a girl in  here and we  just made her  so uncomfortable  that they just  decided not to  have a  yeah she was  uncomfortable  because she  appreciates funny  radio and your  show made her  uncomfortable  now mention  mention pittsburgh 
[01:52:30]  keep it local  what's wrong with  going local with  the radio  that's perfect  there's only way  you defend  against satellite  radio  why wouldn't  they be local  you're not  supposed to  talk about  they're forcing  it  these guys  grew up in  pittsburgh  i could tell  by their  voices  they probably  didn't  they probably  didn't  they did  where did  you grow up  we're actually  originally from  detroit  but we  detroit  and now all  of a sudden  i was trying  to help you  out  put your  pirates hat  on  i was trying  to help  you guys  out 
[01:53:00]  exactly  put your  pirates hat  on and  memorize the  street maps  so the first  day on the  air you had  to have all  those fun  facts about  pittsburgh  in front of  you so you  sounded like  you knew  what you were  talking about  right  yeah we  came on  and we're  just like  hello  yins  pirates  and penguins  go local  sports teams  yeah  see this is  funny  yeah it's funny  now because  they're being  honest  they're funny  too  on the radio  they have to  actually act  like they  like these  things  they're singing  songs about  mario lemieux  like you  plugging your  fucking  or your 
[01:53:30]  effing  if you're  on the air  are we on  the air  down there  of course  we're not  on the air  they're not  the balls  to put  opie and  anthony  on their  show  no they're  not stupid  enough to  get fired  like that  right we  would have  just got  them fired  so they  made the  right choice  there too  sam  you are  putting on  a fake  voice when  you do  your stupid  radio show  we do have  fake radio  voice  does sam  use a fake  voice  the worst  fake voice  you would  ever hear  it's been  toned down  since you  originally heard  we want the  older stuff  they're burning  the older stuff 
[01:54:00]  what is it  what are you  doing  indian queens  wants sam  to be raped  by a lady gaga  cd  would you do  that for the  show sam  raped by a cd  sideways  in the case  yeah in the  case  in the jewel  case  you're a  mess  you're getting  lazy  you're just  picking shows  now without  listening  i listened to  three hours of  this show  we're very  embarrassed today  i listened to  two shows  yesterday and 
[01:54:30]  the freak show  was worse than  the other show  i listened to  yeah we're all  believing that  sam  who else did  you listen to  yeah what was  the other choice  yeah what was  the other choice  in pittsburgh  sam  it wasn't in  pittsburgh  it was in  nebraska  oh you're  telling me  a show in  nebraska  is better  that's right  that's what i'm  telling you  you're worse  than them  at least it was  mario lemieux's  freaking birthday  here yet  yeah  what was going on  in nebraska  that was so  awesome sam  your story's  become a bit  much sam  why didn't  nebraska make 
[01:55:00]  the cut and  these guys did  sam  that's embarrassing  the secret to  surviving jocktober  is if you have a  show that literally  does absolutely  nothing  you're safe  you're safe  because i can't  pull clips from  that there's  nothing to talk  about  but if you're  like the freak  show who puts  on dumb bits  as soon as i hear  dumb bits and  songs  you're in  you're in  dumb bits  yes  like the  office  i don't  do more  of the roses  you might as  well  more of the roses  you will get a  phone scam on  for you sam  i don't do those 
[01:55:30]  things  i work for this  show i don't do  those things  hold on  sam here we go  i'm right back  at you  we're in good  company sam  we both have  horns  but i'm not  insulted by those  things  you want to do  battle of the  sexes sam  and honk your  breasts sam  big bob has  breasts not me  and the only 
[01:56:00]  reason i even  know your name  is because it's  written down in  front of me  you know my  name  and i don't  know you  you did a  standard fat  joke sam  they are ripping  you apart  you know why  because they know  who i am  just off the  top of their  heads  yeah he's  gonna sit on  you sam  exactly who i  am  they're making  it funny you  just going after  the fat easy  target  you stink sam  yeah  bring sam's  radio voice  you got it  it's coming  we have to get  it out of one  system and put 
[01:56:30]  it on us  maybe the freak  show could review  special delivery on  their show  special delivery  you can review it  that's a great  idea  just make fat  jokes all day  sam  no i made one  fat joke  he's a cyber  bully guy  he's a cyber  bully watch  out for sam  roberts  he really is  he really is  we're gonna play  one of sam's  breaks for you  if you guys  have a minute  and maybe it's  good i like sam  so maybe it's a  great break  you're welcome  uh could be an  excellent break  maybe we'll be  fair  i'll bet it  will be i'll bet

[02:17:30]  I'm not gonna do any of those three  if you're playing the same fucking songs every night  so show some disgust  I'm not gonna do any of those things  this is how Kenny does it  I like the songs  this is how Kenny does it  listen but they'd also be outraged  outraged?  that's a say  he used a slur  laughing?  they'd be outraged  that laughing?  no they'd be outraged  that the slur  used to describe people  Sam no one would be outraged

[02:36:00]  it was just a regular  show today  yeah  oh dude  I fucking don't feel right  it's called hepatitis  yeah right  has that kid been  inoculated  you went from like  the top radio host  in the country  to an intern  yeah  yeah you did  you fucking  man  you know what  I'm a man of my word though  you can't now say  he's not  you guys outsmarted me  which is not easy  you fuckers  I swear to god  I'll take you inside  the thing completely  I was like  there's no fucking way 
[02:36:30]  anyone will ever  get to the studio  in time  so every once in a while  I'll throw this on the air  like as a goof  baby diaper mustache  knowing there's no fucking way  but these motherfuckers  were in cahoots  and outsmarted me  that doesn't happen  it all just came together  it certainly did  and you played it perfectly  did you come in  and get his first appearance  I got it from the point  when he was like  you realized  that Bonnie wasn't here  and then you know  you guys were just talking 
[02:37:00]  and then he pulled  the diaper out  and you were like  oh my god  you had no clue  I had a diaper on me  no  I thought it was off the hook  because when I saw your face  I'm like  oh shit  you're in town  for a doctor's visit  you've done it before  and then when you came in  you acted perfectly  like what are you talking about  and then when I set up the bid  like oh thank god  I'm off the hook  and you go  well  bam  and you showed the diaper  can you cut where he just said  you acted perfectly  can we get that anywhere  on TV  or something  you acted  the keyword would be 
[02:37:30]  acted perfectly  yeah  okay  you know what  tell Chaz about that  next time you talk to  Palomari or whatever his name is  where did Bobby go  Volsi  physically  his whole head turns  beet red  you see how his audience feels  can we take a break  I need to  yeah  we'll take a break  you probably should scrub under there  with maybe lemons or something  dude  I'm getting sick all over again  because  it's in my  not that I have a mustache  I didn't see it  you got like a little stubble 
[02:38:00]  it's even worse  because it's easier to get caught in stubble  than a mustache  you just wipe it out of a mustache  it's going to be great  in a few days when he has chicken pox  all the baby diseases  you're going to have baby diseases  the mumps  he'll have all the baby diseases  rubella  you have rubella  you're going to have a little balloon following you  wow that was an old one  Jesus Christ  why don't you just go back to polio  you fucking fossil  like when I can make old jokes 
[02:38:30]  two minutes ago I was a king  yeah that's how this place works  one minute you're a king  the next you got baby shit  under your nose  I don't even know what you guys said  I am so fucking out of it right now  well I guess you should be  because I got all hyped out  the adrenaline and everything  you know if you make it sound  and then puked in the bathroom  you make it sound too much like  you got a buzz off of it  all the kids  all the kids are going to be  rubbing baby shit under their nose  by the way  Blotto from  Blotto 98 Detroit  Patrice equals bluffing puss wad 
[02:39:00]  Opie equals man of his word  what a difference a week makes  yeah because Patrice was supposed  to take a fucking strap on  up the butt last week  well you know I'm not saying  baby shit under your nose  is a treat  by any stretch of the imagination  but Patrice getting fucked in the ass  with a dildo  and him backing out of that  might  I could see a little justification  you gotta just trick Patrice  and tell him it's a cattle prod  dude what do I wipe  under my nose  I really don't know  what gets the smell of baby shit 
[02:39:30]  out of a man's mustache stubble  you should ask a few pedophiles  they could help you out  adult shit  cover it up  doesn't Bob Kelly owe him  a hundred bucks for that diaper  yeah Bob owes you a hundred  watch that  he said if something comes in  a hundred dollars guaranteed  oh that's right  a hundred dollars cash buddy  fuck em  oh fuck  dude I need something  for my nose  I'm begging  I'm begging  I'm begging  I would think  probably lemon  what do we got 
[02:40:00]  I'm serious  see you should have  kept some ketchup  Sam in Jersey  what's up  hey what's up boys  hey  radio gold  yeah  yeah that  I never  I really didn't think  you were gonna do it  I would say radio green  dude I actually  when I looked at the diaper  the first time  and then  what really got me  was when I put the gloves on  and then I like smear  like you would  baby  I can't even talk  like finger paint  and it was now  a nice glob  on each index finger 
[02:40:30]  yeah  I started getting light headed  I started to go to  a safe place  yeah maybe  do we have a cleaning product  maybe like a dab  a little Lysol  no joke  I gotta go do something  yeah  do whatever you gotta do  put that in a paper towel  and dab it in your whiskers  back to the Laszlo and Anthony show  yeah let me  Laszlo I've had something  to confess  for quite a while  now we'll take  we'll take a break  while Opie  fucking tries to get  baby shit out  from under his nose  I can't believe you did that  give some breadcrumbs  back to your dignity  we'll be right back 
[02:41:00]  on the way  the hosts  staff  and the guests  of the Opie and Anthony show  dish out  and take even more  verbal abuse  as the worst of  Opie and Anthony's  spinning  wheel  of hate  continues  alright  welcome back to  the spinning wheel  of hate  I'm your host  Roland  time to spin the wheel  again  let's see who our  next victim is  Anthony  it's Anthony  during the interview  with the guy  who runs 
[02:41:30]  FARC  we looked over  and noticed  Anthony wasn't  paying attention  find out what  happens  on the spinning  wheel  of hate  the spinning  wheel  of hate  another good  example  out in Colorado  there was a  homeowners association  that told a guy  that he couldn't  have a peace sign  in his Christmas  decorations  because it was  a satanic symbol  now  that doesn't matter  that's a stupid  thing to say  but at the end  of the day  this is nobody's  business  front page CNN  for 24 hours  who cares  that kind of stuff 
[02:42:00]  why is it like  that with people  I was away  for two months  out of the country  I come back  it seems more  like that kind  of shit  like people  interested in  dull shit  yeah  well it's been  going on for a  while  the Daily Coast  did a great  thing that I  love to talk  about  in October  of 2006  they took  CNN's front  page  stripped off  all the crap  news  all the ads  all of what  they call  YouTube  voyeurism  in fact  I just saw  it come  across  while we were  sitting here  talking about  the news  they had  the two-headed  turtle  that's what  they call 
[02:42:30]  YouTube  voyeurism  it's basically  just crap  that's on  YouTube  and they  read it  as  you could  probably  see that  on a  newscast  and they  took all  that crap  off of CNN's  main page  and they  were left  with five  lines of  text  that was it  and what  they did  was then  they compared  it to  China News  Daily  and you  can't tell  the difference  between those  two pages  because they're  running all  news  so people  wrote in  and complained  and said  well it's  unfair to  compare it  to China  News Daily  so they  went back  and they  got a copy  of CNN's  homepage  out of  2000  out of  the internet  archive  and did  the same  thing  and you  can't tell  the difference  it's definitely  slipped  it's gone  from being 
[02:43:00]  total real  news  to just  complete  garbage  and crap  well even  when they  have  even when  you watch  CNN  it's like  even when  they're  doing  real news  like Wolf  Blitzer  has to have  a fucking  music bed  under him  it's like  why  do you need  a music  bed  what is that  yeah  I have no  idea  it's distracting  it's not  helping the  story  it's not  informative  it's just  douchey  and irritating  well that  show he's  got too  where they've  got like  the dozen  TV screens  with crap  going on  all of them  what the hell  is going on  in the background  there exactly  I know 
[02:43:30]  other channels  we're watching  Fox  yeah  we're watching  Fox and  CNN  that's where  it's gotten  to  that'd be  great  if it was  all animal  fucking  pornography  that's right  that's where  it's going  in the back  just kind of  switched it  yeah  well that was  the funny  thing  is like  we were  talking about  people having  sex with  dogs being  a traffic  rating  crab  there's a  website called  NC Buy in  2003 that  made the  mistake of  you know how  every year  around New  Year's they  do the  top 10  stories of  the year  well and  usually they'll  pick the  biggest stories  of the year  and usually  it's editorially  controlled  well this  North Carolina  newspaper made 
[02:44:00]  the mistake  and I've never  seen anybody  do this again  of doing it  based on  traffic to  articles  number one  article for  2003 was a  guy who beat  his son to  death because  he caught him  in a bar  fucking the  family dog  number one  story  it was fantastic  that's a big  one how old  was the kid  like 12-13  I don't know  what kind of  dog was it  I have no  idea  golden retriever  something I  don't know  hey Drew  I think you're  boring Anthony  yeah you fell  asleep over there  look at that  it's great  I have a  question for  Drew  what's up  what's the  peace symbol  that resembles 
[02:44:30]  the Satan  symbol  it was just  basically somebody  trying to make  a big fuss  out of it  and so somebody  claimed that the  peace symbol  is a Satanic  symbol I have  no idea  but which peace  symbol is that  I'm really  confused  there's only one  it's that one  isn't it this  no no no  the circle with  the lines  a lot of  stuff  oh Francine  don't be  fresh  we lost  Anthony  and everyone's  just having a  casual conversation  I feel nauseous  too  I feel like I'm  going to puke  since we said  when I eat too 
[02:45:00]  much fruit  mixed with coffee  it does something  in my stomach  Anthony's out  cold  and we're  continuing  to radio  we should all  jerk off on him  we should just  leave him  and he'll wake  up  just keep the  channel live  with him  sleeping  there you go  lower the shade  I blame you  Drew  you put him  to sleep  I know  I'm sorry  Bill O'Reilly  found out that  the two otters  were gay  on YouTube 
[02:45:30]  and he says  he's not against  otters  just otters  having gay  sex  so he's not  against gay  otters  that's what  a general  said  a senator  said  the general  said  I'm against  homosexuality  and the  senator back  here said  I agree with  what he said  and the press  came down on him  and said  just how you  really feel  you're against  homosexuality  he goes  I never said 
[02:46:00]  I was against  homosexuality  homosexuality  is fine  I'm just  against  homosexual  sex  you know  so what are  they supposed  to do  go to  Starbucks  and just  wave at  each other  wave different  CDs at each  other  go to  Target  and talk  about sheets  exactly  all those  turgid  cocks  no one  can do  anything  with them  I know  I know  turgid  turgid  I gotta look  that up  turgid I think  means like  stiff  yeah  Francine  you did a  great job  for us  today  you're always  good 
[02:46:30]  hey Rick  what are you  plugging today  Saturday night  I'm doing an  hour show  at the  cutting room  at midnight  which is really  it's been  Gino Bisconti's  show at  Caroline's  after that  Friday night  at around  1  it starts  at 12  30  I'll be there  after the  cutting room  and  I was  supposed to  tell you  I was in  a car  accident 
[02:47:00]  and I  hallucinated  being chased  by pine nuts  which is  true  wait what  my friend  said I  had a  concussion  and I  walked around  and I  would slam  the door  and say  shut the  door  I'm being  chased  by pine  nuts  like I  had a  concussion  I was  talking to  my phone  putting people  on hold  and I was  making out  with girls  that weren't  there  I was  like that  this is what  my friends  told me  so I  just thought  that would  be interesting  why pine nuts  they're such  a yummy treat 
[02:47:30]  I don't even think  about pine nuts  why not walnuts  are food I don't  like  pine nuts  are delish  I never even  think about  pine nuts  that's why  they're great  in a salad  though  what's better  than pine nuts  in a salad  candy corns  I stand  correct  Rick and I  are doing  our own show  it's called  I fucked up  I was trying  to think of  what you'd call  little things  that go in  salad  and I realized  I had nothing  salad treats  I'm just amazed  he's out cold  yeah  I thought he was 
[02:48:00]  faking  no no  no  he's not  narcolepsy strikes  hold on  I'm so mad  I let that salad  improv go  I didn't catch it  I didn't catch it  it's my fault  no no  I didn't have  anything  I flubbed it  I just saw this  thing of us  riffing on salad  for a good 40 minutes  chickpeas  that's what we need  chickpeas  and sliced  beets  that's like  that's like  the old time  salad bar  I like how you're  looking at me  right now  like who cares  no I'm just  no I'm pleased

[02:49:00]  say to her  before I leave  like hey  you know  just in case  I'm killed  in a plane crash  I'll talk to you  later  and she's like  that's not  don't say that  so she fucking  wrote  plane is so small  if I die  I love you  and I died  feeling a little  sad you didn't  text me back  I don't want you  to carry the weight  and feel guilty  just learn from it  and go on to be  a better man  good  that's impressive  man  encouraging  and I know  if she died  in a plane crash  I wouldn't go on  to be a better man  I would just  get a whore  and forget  just pay for a  blowjob  hey  a man  not a saint

[02:50:00]  cutting room  thing is going  to be  every week  Wednesdays  and Saturdays  but this week's  important  because I get  to advertise  it here  my head  is killing me  Rick's a great  live show  if you haven't  seen Rick live  he's just  he's really  really smart  and funny  and interesting  conceptually  it's interesting  it's a great  fucking show  man  for real  thanks man  I love what  you do  we love each  other  yeah  but I'll never  admit it  and Drew

[03:08:30]  I'm sleepy!  Leave me alone!  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, good. I was asleep for quite some time.  I was asleep for quite a bit.  Yeah.  Here's what happens. 
[03:09:00]  I was asleep for...  I had to go and see what's in the air.  I had to go and see what's in the air.  I had to go and see what's in the air.  I have to go and see what's in it.  The end of the air is happening.  I have to go and see what feels like.  I'll be back to you.  Great. 
[03:09:30]  You're shitting me, right?  The line of the day is...  I should have went to sleep when Danny left.  I was up too late.  I made it in, but I couldn't make it to the finish line.

Oh, well, everyone left early, though.  It's not even 11.  Still being taped.  I knew I was going to sleep, too. 
[03:11:00]  My eyes were done.  Yeah, yeah, that classical music.  I'm sure that didn't help much.  Does this count as bonus time?  Enjoy the replay, Ant.  I'm glad you're not a pilot. 
[03:11:30]  Sleeping high, raise in the Maxwell show.  Good morning.  You did.  Is that when you did that?  Oh, nappy.  Good morning.  They did leave Anthony alone.  Wake up, douche. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, my God.  That's good.  You're kidding.  I should have been out by fucking...  over at CVS.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  When?  All right.  Bye.  See you tomorrow.  On Saturday.  It's Saturday.  Oh, fuck.  See you on Monday.  It's Saturday.  Maybe I should come in for a make-up day.  Nighty-night, rabbit. 
[03:13:00]  Welcome back to the Spinning Wheel of Hades.  I'm your host, Roland.  Time to spin the wheel again.  And see who our next victim is.  Jim Norton.  You know you mean Norton?  Jimmy is almost impossible to get.  This one is a biggie.  When exit management sent down the legal notice  that Jimmy would have to attend a sensitive training,  find out how Jimmy reacts.  You know, on the Spinning Wheel of Hades.  Oh, sensitivity training. 
[03:13:30]  Ah.  Me don't know how to read.  Me stupid.  The Spinning Wheel of Hades.  Hey.  We're going to Washington, D.C.  It is absolutely a joke.  I won't allow you to attend something like that.  All right.  I wouldn't.  All right, well, that's no joke.  A three-hour meeting he has to do?  Not happening.  Wow.  No.  Not happening.  Try to get some synergy going between us and Washington, D.C.  You don't want to do that.  And has just handed in the Opie and Anthony visit agenda.  Here is the best. 
[03:14:00]  So then we have the working lunch, and that will wrap at 1230.  So from 1230 to 130, it's kind of a wrap-up  where you're saying goodbye to people  and getting yourself out of there and you're checking out of the hotel.  And guess what?  At 130, Opie, Anthony, Eric, and Martini Steve all get to go to the train station at 130.  We leave.  Back on the choo-choo.  So everyone leaves except, and it says it right here, Jim Norton.  And then Jim Norton, from 130 to 430, three hours, will be hanging in human resources for sensitivity training. 
[03:14:30]  Do you understand you would have had a better shot if you would have written,  Jim Norton will model his abs and get a job with Ford modeling.  You would have had a better shot if you think I'm staying down there and going through sensitivity training.  You are out of your fucking mind.  It's not happening.  Sensitivity training. 
[03:15:00]  Maybe you could send someone from human resources in, and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area.  And then they can leave.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That's going to be fun.  I smell promo.  Corporate diva.  This just is not happening.  Under any circumstances, will that, will that, that's not happening.  They're making y'all take the train?  Yeah, we're taking the train.  How long is that, like three hours for us?  No, that's actually fine.  Train's fine.  We don't mind a train. 
[03:15:30]  We don't mind that at all.  How about we have the sensitivity meeting on the train?  She takes a 40-minute flight.  Three hours.  Don't you understand?  You have a better chance of Michael Corleone just handing the children over to Kay.  That is more likely than me staying for that horrendous three-hour meeting.  And the meeting should go like this.  1.30, human resources, attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  1.30, 5, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor.  That's how that meeting goes. 
[03:16:00]  Hand out hankies on the way in.  Jim, we don't like a lot.  End of meeting.  If I ever beat a black man to death in New Orleans and sit on his face until he vacates,  I am more than deserving of some sensitivity training.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  That is not happening.  This is not happening.  Not just your Tuesday three-hour meeting. 
[03:16:30]  Guys, they want us to do this once a month, by the way.  This isn't happening.  Well, you know something?  They've completely turned me off to going down there and doing anything.  Well, it was supposed to be...  XM people, don't you know that's why they agreed to do yours network?  So they didn't have to do this dumb shit.  I will circle this.  There it is.  Working lunch?  No, I'm scratching out working.  There you go.  Lunch.  I'll keep lunch.  Lunch.  I'll keep lunch.  Lunch, good.  But that's it.  Keep lunch.  Break.  I'm keeping break, and I'm changing the 12 to a 1. 
[03:17:00]  There you go.  12.30 to 1.45.  Investor conference?  What about system training?  Oh, where is that?  We don't have to push any buttons.  Oh, I don't care about that because I'm not involved.  No.  Steve and Eric, can you guys fight your own battle on that one?  Break, another break from 3.30 to 3.45.  But I see it's the Human Resources Legal 2005 policy goes to 4.15.  So now the break goes from 3.30 to 4.15.  There you go.  That's a nice long break.  Yeah, we're doing satellite radio. 
[03:17:30]  Anything goes.  No one is missing from this whole schedule, by the way, marketing of the show.  Ah, yes.  One thing we care about.  No wonder nothing gets done down there because this is probably an example of what all these  guys have to do.  All right.  Well, I got my schedule, and I'm happy with it now.  I just, I'm going to photocopy Anthony's and say that that is my schedule as well.  There it is.  This is amazing, actually.  I think he actually left the human resource meeting.  Oh.  No, he knows better.  That thing.  No.  Yeah.  Nice.  There it is.  There you go.  Now it's a Jim Norton schedule. 
[03:18:00]  1.30 to 4.30, instead of HR sensitivity training, put laughing on train with friends.  As we zip north through Philadelphia.  As they sit there, looking at their watches, wondering when you're going to arrive.  Exactly.  For the meeting.  Maybe the next time I go down, you can have promptness meetings because I've missed this  for a month.  Take staggering trip to bar car.  Let's go to Catherine.  Catherine.  To get you out of your meetings, boys.  Yes.  All you need is to get Jim over there to kick a little shit rock out of his pants, bring 
[03:18:30]  in a little bucket of sawdust, wet a chair, and act like complete animals.  Good callback.  We should wet ourselves and crap our pants in the meeting.  Let me tell you this, and you can take this to the bank, as they say.  If there are meetings we're sitting through, all morning I'm drinking coffee with half and  half and other lactose-filled products.  I might have a banana smoothie.  I will show you the error of your ways.  If they want synergy, we'll give them synergy. 
[03:19:00]  You get the share in his lovely gas, too.  You have no idea what I will be doing in those meetings.  It's going to smell like an offshore oil drill rig.  Complete and total waste of time.  I will not, mark my words, I will not be party to this.  I will not be.  I will go to any meeting after the show that involves Eric Logan and some very high-end marketing  people to discuss the program, where we want it to go, and the marketing of the program.  I will not be in the XM building any later than 1.30, maybe? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, after lunch.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Sneak out.  Whatever you want to do for those three hours is great.  All they do in entertainment, human resources.  Oh, they do.  And look, let's be honest.  For as much as we are pigs on the air, no one here has any type of sexual harassment issues.  We don't have any, I mean, we've teased people on the air, we don't interact in the office  rudely with other people.  Under no circumstances am I having one of those awful meetings.  Yeah, as soon as we leave this little environment that is the O&A show, the studio here, that's 
[03:20:00]  it.  We're not animals.  We know how to act in society.  What do you think?  We run out there, grab the wiffle ball bat, and chase women around outside the studio?  Here's the human resources meeting, how to better interact with coworkers.  It should be with us, human resources, and a moving company with a truck.  We could say, how to get that furniture into the truck faster.  Get everyone else out of here.  Look, I went home yesterday and slept for five hours.  I slept for five hours.  I went out and I did four shows.  Yeah.  And I tried to sleep, but I overslept. 
[03:20:30]  There's no way I'm doing that.  You know what?  It's not about that.  I would spend, honestly, six hours in Washington if I knew, in meetings, if I knew it was going  to make this show better.  I will sit for six hours and take any suggestion that's going to make this radio show better.  But this other stuff is just a waste of time that has nothing to do with Anthony and I  and Norton and everybody else putting on a clever, entertaining, funny show.  But this other stuff is a complete waste of time. 
[03:21:00]  Hey, Mike from Boston, you ass.  He writes, you dumb asses.  In corporate America, everyone has to go take stupid sexual harassment training.  Quit your bitching.  This was never supposed to be a corporate job.  Don't you get it?  Shut up.  You know what radio was all about?  Before these stupid lawyers and suits and corporate people got involved, it was a bunch  of guys that were losers and hippies that just got high and did drugs, came into a radio  station and played their favorite music.  That's what this was supposed to be.  And now it's like, now they invented a human resource department. 
[03:21:30]  A human resource for people like us that do radio?  Are you insane?  And as far as sexual harassment, you know, I don't need some corporate idiot telling me  about it.  I was raised properly and I'm a pervert when I spend my money.  I don't walk up to girls in the office and grab my crotch because I was raised right.  I know not to act that way.  Isn't it insulting that they think you have to go to a meeting to learn how to be a human  being?  Yeah.  That you're not going to go around with your schlong hanging out and walk into a cubicle  and slap girls in the face with it? 
[03:22:00]  And if you do, maybe you send them to training to not have those big tits showing during the work  day.  Yeah, those old dirty bitches.  What did we learn on the show today?  Well, I'm not even officially part of the show, but I just feel outraged for you.  And not just piss you off.  Yeah, but we bring this stuff up all the time and they're like, oh, you guys complain too  much on your radio show.  Well, yeah, we want to be the best radio show in America.  Simple.  That's our goal.  That's our goal.  But we need help to get there.  We can't do this pretty good radio show to a small amount of people and assume that it's 
[03:22:30]  just going to grow like a wildfire.  You know, we need help.  Real help.  We need to be off this stupid premium channel.  We we've proven ourselves by now that we're not animals with fucking horns coming out of  our skulls that we put on a nice, clever and not nice, but a clever, entertaining radio  show.  And it's a funny show.  And it's edgy and outrageous at times.  Well, yeah, it's pertinent.  And it's and it's like a regular channel, like have your own channel.  But enough with the hiding the show. 
[03:23:00]  The show is pretty much hidden.  Yeah.  And with and with that, we've done very, very well.  They're extremely happy with the amount of people listening to the show.  But we're not.  We're going to.  We know it could be a lot, lot better.  We're going to need you to go ahead and come in for the entire day on Monday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then why don't you go ahead and come in Tuesday also?  Yeah.  Where's your flare?  Did you get the memo on the cover sheet for the TPS reports? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  That's exactly what it's like.  Office space.  The spinning wheel of hate.  So what are we going to say to Elo about this, these meetings and the agenda and stuff?  That we're not going.  Yeah.  Why even acknowledge it?  Just don't do it.  We say that we're not going.  But they have a whole schedule.  People are going to be sitting in conference rooms waiting for us to show up.  Let him sit.  Let him sit.  Yeah.  Unless we all want to draw straws and the one that loses has to go and represent the entire show.  But it ain't going to be me. 
[03:24:00]  I'll tell you one thing.  In room movies, room service.  That's who I'm meeting with.  I'm meeting with the wonderful person at the door with the cart.  Then why are we going there?  Room service.  We have to go down there and kind of like, you know, get some synergy with some of these people.  And we have to get some FaceTime with some of these people.  I won't have synergy or FaceTime.  Yeah.  I'm having a meeting after the show with a couple of people that are very involved with the future of this program.  Anyone else?  Bye.  See ya.  Well, Army wants in on this really fast. 
[03:24:30]  Army the trucker.  Go ahead, Army.  Yeah.  Consensitivity for others.  Consideration for others.  Training.  Give me a break.  Like, oh, what kind of garbage is this?  I'll tell you what.  This stuff is weakening our country.  It's making us a country of pussies.  I don't think so, man.  Dude, it's more thought policing by the left.  Yep.  That's all.  It's more thought.  And again, if you're sexually harassing somebody at work, you should be fired.  But don't try to cut me off at the pass.  I was raised, right?  Well, it's corporate BS that they want us to go through. 
[03:25:00]  Because these corporate scumbags have been protecting people who make money for the company, who sexually harass their secretaries.  So they protect the guys that make the money.  All right, man.  They protect these guys, and then they make the rest of the people in the corporation suffer because they got sued because they overprotected the guy they should have fired.  Well, dude, I don't want to deal with the whole ELO thing.  Someone else has got to deal with the phone call saying that.  I'll deal with it.  Not going.  Click.  That this agenda is way out of hand.  And, well, I don't really care about the sensitivity of training because I don't see Anthony and my name next to that part of this agenda. 
[03:25:30]  No, I just see us on Monday with 19 hours of meetings.  All the way to 930 at night.  That ain't happening.  We'll cut a few of these things out.  But, you know, we will get some face time with some of the people down there and, you know, and talk about how to make this show better.  I'm drooling on my pillow by 930.  I will not be sitting in a meeting or having dinner or talking to institutional investors or automotive people. 
[03:26:00]  Context of show in automobile.  Let's say hi to ELO.  It's ELO.  Eric?  How are you?  Hi, Eric.  How are you doing?  Mr. Logan, how are you?  Jimmy?  Pleasure to speak with you.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  I'm tired, actually.  I'm very crappy.  Listen, I wanted to just, you know, let you know that I really appreciate all the help you're giving us.  We actually are applying for our Canadian license as we speak with the Canadian government.  Are you really?  Yes.  Ah, please. 
[03:26:30]  Good.  You'll get it.  No, I think I support the Canadians and, you know, how we can be in business with them.  Hence the sensitivity training.  I apologize.  I wasn't being very sensitive.  Yeah, I mean, that's the 1.30 on Tuesday, so.  1.30 on Tuesday, meeting with Canadians.  Yes.  Yeah, actually.  I'm coming with a make-believe jersey on.  If you don't mind, I'm going to extract the HR sensitivity training.  I'm just going to put Canadian sensitivity training.  I have to apologize to the prime minister, but I have to do it through a hole in a buddy booth.  That stupid country stinks.  So, Eric. 
[03:27:00]  Set fire to it.  Eric, obviously, Norton has a little problem meeting with human resources and talking about sexual harassment.  Why?  And sensitivity training.  I mean, it's just really, honestly, just company policy.  I mean, everybody has to go through it.  I mean, you don't have to be involved.  You can just sit there and watch the videos, and there's a little test at the end of it that you have to fill out.  A test?  You saw it, and you have to kind of, it's kind of a quiz, and they have some questions on there that says things to the effect of, you know, it's like, you know, if somebody approached you in the hallway and said this. 
[03:27:30]  Scenarios.  I can't tell you what the questions are, obviously, but, I mean, it's, you know, you get the point.  You have to kind of test out of the class because for people who don't, they have to go back through it again because it's something that, you know, corporate America makes us do.  Well, here's how you know I'm doing the test.  After the video of the sexual harassment, you guys can turn the lights on, and when you see a powerful tent in the front of my pants, you'll know I passed.  Okay, and the answer to every question is throw her against the wall and take what's yours. 
[03:28:00]  I'm sure we can work that out.  So, can we cut down?  And by the way, guys, I apologize on the agenda, too.  5.30, I had check-in.  You guys are getting here on Sunday, so that was a typo on my behalf.  I apologize.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I was wondering about that.  And also, how come, and I'm not trying to throw my friends in the barrel, but none of the other guys had to go through sensitivity training?  Well, we sort of.  They did.  They came down.  I don't know where you were.  I think you were on the road or something before the show started.  I know we talked to Human Resources for a little while.  I sat in hours of meetings when we were down there.  I don't even know what they were for. 
[03:28:30]  Are you telling me I actually sat through that?  Was that the one in the big conference room?  That was the one in the big conference room, yes.  There's no way I'm sitting in a three-hour meeting with a woman from Human Resources.  I can't have it.  Who am I going to sexually harass?  It's all guys up here.  Well, Jimmy, I mean, look.  It's way different for three hours.  I mean, you just need to calm down.  That's what you need to do.  I'm very calm.  No, you're not.  You're out of your mind.  Am I going to look at the mule of the guy who runs the Broadway channel in the restroom?  What am I going to do?  Jimmy, it's only three hours at the most. 
[03:29:00]  I mean, again, I will cut some of the stuff out.  I may try to get you out of here by 4, and you can catch the 410, and you can be back in New York by 7, 730.  Can't happen.  Well, what can happen, though, is she can come here.  She's more than welcome to come here and follow me around while I do my spots and wait in the car for me.  And then I'm driving from the cellar to stay up in New York.  All right.  Well, you know what, Jimmy?  We should talk offline because, I mean, you and I really have to hammer this out.  I mean, this is just â€“ I mean, it's something that has to happen.  I mean, everybody goes through this.  Not happening. 
[03:29:30]  It's got to happen.  It can happen.  Why not?  Because I don't subscribe to it.  I think it's more thought policing.  And I think that the guilty should be fired immediately, and I'm guilty of nothing.  And I don't sexually harass people.  I'm a pig on the air, and I'm a pig off the air, but not in the office.  I ignore everybody in the office.  And what's the whole sensitivity training as far as Norton goes?  Well, I mean, really what it is is just to kind of understand where personal boundaries are and what's considered over the line.  And it's not as much about content on the show. 
[03:30:00]  It's just behavior in the corporate workplace.  And since, you know, we want to get you guys more integrated down here, as you know, Jimmy, and bring it down,  we just need to make sure we're really clear about where the lines are.  I mean, we've had people go last week, you know, Kevin Kennedy is going through this, and we all got to do it.  Are they going to sit down for sensitivity training?  Of course.  So people know that they shouldn't shoot steroids and then be a hero to children?  Maybe they could sit in the meeting with them.  Me and Giambi could sit there and chit-chat for a little while.  And I'll tell you where the line is.  It's right under my belt, and it's in the form of a zipper, and I'll take it out and show any gal who wants to see it. 
[03:30:30]  I mean, you're making my point, Jim.  I mean, I understand your angst about this, but...  It's not even angst.  I'm a gentleman off the air.  Of course he is.  And I will not be put through any type of silly corporate training when I've done nothing to merit it except be a fine fellow.  I just want to be able to tape this meeting and throw it on the air.  There's no way I'm leaving after everybody else.  It's an impossibility.  I don't know.  I mean, we can tape it, Opie.  I mean, it's a great idea.  I mean, it'd probably be a good thing for everybody to kind of understand. 
[03:31:00]  I mean, it's not as bad as you think it is.  It really is not.  It's horrendous on every level.  I'm giving up two nights of stand-up to be down there to begin with, which I can't afford to because I'm trying to make a tape for The Tonight Show.  I'm not going to give up three more hours, get on a train later, and then come home by myself like an ass.  Yeah.  Because I was talking to some lady who's got shorter hair than most ladies should in human resources.  Well, you know, you guys can discuss this, but I have a problem with the number of meetings that we're in. 
[03:31:30]  Well, I mean, listen, I mean, and also just understand something.  I know I got a message from Ben about the Ram dinner that night, you know, with the 15 people.  Everybody who's coming, you know, it says 30 people.  It's broken out into markets, so we will have, you know, that'll be done within two hours for sure.  You do understand you're saying the word hours.  Yeah.  No, I know.  You have 60 minutes.  So it's like 120, possibly 140, 145 minutes if you want to go by the minute. 
[03:32:00]  I just thought we'd do two hours.  Will you go to that, Jimmy?  Yeah, dinner.  Of course.  I'll eat.  And then maybe we could cover the sensitivity training.  Maybe I could just stand naked and Gloria Allred could come in and point at my genitals and go dirty, dirty, dirty.  It could happen.  Jimmy?  Yes, sir?  You know I love you, right?  And it's very mutual.  I mean, seriously.  You know I love you.  Yes, and I'm very fond of you.  Okay.  And you know that there's no way in hell I'd make you sit through three hours of sensitivity training.  No, of course not, because I'll be on the train or I'll be in New York. 
[03:32:30]  I'll be in New York.  Opie, you can tell us.  He's so got you.  Oh!  He's so got you.  Oh!  I sat in my office yesterday.  Oh!  And we, and because, because Jimmy was like, what are we doing?  What are we doing?  So I figured, what the hell?  I'll make an agenda.  We so got him.  Oh, my God.  You, do you know, and I'm going to be really honest with you, I was, at first I'm like,  this is a joke.  I was, I was sure it was a joke. 
[03:33:00]  I'm walking home yesterday, and I'm like, this is not a joke.  This is, because corporate America is so, you, I gotta, God, damn it!  Oh, you really nailed me.  Bravo, Elo.  When I put, when I put break and I put free time on there, I said, I screwed up.  I said, they're going to see right through.  We got the, we got the king, man.  We got the king.  But that was, it was, that was so well, I really, and the explanation, what you were 
[03:33:30]  just saying on the thing, I mean, I didn't want to yell at you, because A, I like you,  but more importantly, you can fire me, you're my boss.  But I'm like, this son of a bitch is really going to put me through this.  Wow.  You know, I'd love nothing more to get the tapes and just go through it with this.  Oh, yeah.  That would be, I mean, I actually, it would be a great thing.  Honestly, here's the deal.  Uh, when this came in yesterday, uh, I, I was had, I was definitely had all day yesterday.  I was had.  Anthony was had, and then, uh, and then I started feeling guilty, because I know how  Norton obsesses about things. 
[03:34:00]  I'm like, this is a fun gag, and, and we'll get him bad, we'll smash him really good, but  I know he'll spend all night.  That's probably why he didn't sleep, by the way, if I know you a little bit.  I heard you say that this morning, I felt really bad.  No, I'm not even kidding.  Elo, I guarantee you obsessed about this all day long.  I thought about it yesterday.  I didn't think about it at night.  I was too depressed about my sexual addiction, but you got me, and I deserved it, because I'm  a creep, but I'm like, this is about things I've said on the show.  They're worried I'm going to do something in the office.  You really nailed my stupid, fat face.  Good one.  Oh, that was a good one.  Bravo, Elo. 
[03:34:30]  This was a good one.  I had to do something.  You really got me.  No, it's going to be fun.  You guys come down here.  I promise you, there's no, I promise you, there's no hours of meetings.  We're going to, we're going to have a great time and do a couple things and get you guys  out of here.  That was brilliantly, the break things were, that was the only error, because the other  stuff was so brilliantly worded.  It was hysterical.  It was 15 minutes for free time.  And what was it, the chat yesterday was like, you were asking when you could take your dump,  and the guy was like, hey, lighten up.  You got two 15 minutes.  Were you guys just all sitting around in Washington, just laughing hysterically in an office somewhere 
[03:35:00]  as we're losing our minds up here?  Actually, you know, the funny part about the whole Ram dinner, I mean, there is no Ram dinner.  I mean, the dinner is going to be us, you know, jerking off at an Irish pub getting hammered.  I mean, that's what it's going to be.  Right, right.  Son of a bitch.  But anyway, so, you know, Brian Shea and Dan Murphy and all the guys that run all the  Circuit Cities and Best Buys and Clients, all the Rams, which are the regional area managers  all across the country, all were listening to the show.  They all called them in a fit of rage and panic yesterday going, what are we presenting? 
[03:35:30]  We didn't even know we had to be here.  So they had no idea either.  Got those dim wits, too.  I think Anthony was suspicious the whole time.  No, I was suspicious at first.  Not even at first, not at first.  At first, I bought it.  Then as I looked at it more, I'm like, there's no way this could be real.  And then as I remembered some of the stuff that's gone on in the corporate world, I was  like, oh my God, this is true.  So yeah, I was completely gotten.  Do you know what would help sell me?  And it was a little thing.  It was when I said you text messaged him and said, oh, stop being babies.  It's one day of work. 
[03:36:00]  And that was such, yesterday you said he said that on the show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was such a boss thing to say.  Oh, no, that was one day, guys.  Right, right.  That was a listener, actually.  I thought it was Eric Logan.  Oh, no, no, no.  For some reason, I misinterpreted that as Logan.  And that's all.  No, because I didn't know until last night when I was getting ready to crash.  Yeah, Opie figured that and called me that.  Well, no.  At 830, right?  My text message was, I hate your guts.  Payback's going to be a bitch.  I go, we're never gotten.  And then I'm like, well, we won't tell Jim because we'll have fun tomorrow with this. 
[03:36:30]  That is really funny.  Hey, by the way, what is institutional shareholders?  Yeah, shareholders.  You know, basically, Joe Utenauer, who's our CFO, manages all the big funds like Leg Mason  and T. Roy Price and all those folks that actually have a large amount of stock in the company.  So, they often ask questions about where we're going and stuff.  So, it's not unusual for us to do, you know, investor meetings and stuff like that.  Ah, there's the memo.  The schedule being ripped up. 
[03:37:00]  Very good, Eric.  Yeah.  That was very good.  That was written up.  Those little things were written up so well.  That was, because it's like, we're not dumb.  And it's like, God damn it, this is for real.  Like, we thought it was a goof and then like, no, this is real.  It was worded the way they actually word things.  But, I mean, it's, I mean, that would be, honestly, I mean, the thing about it is, is  that that would not be an uncommon day at XM.  Right.  That's what we deal with on a daily basis.  Yeah.  I mean, it's meetings and meetings and meetings.  And, yeah, I mean, it's what it is.  And I think Opie said it was XM, you know, extreme meetings. 
[03:37:30]  All right.  Thanks, Eric.  Good one, man.  You guys have a good day.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Bye, Eric.  I love that.  So happy with himself that he got us.  He really, really got me.  You should have saw your face when we were telling you.  Nailed.  Priceless.  We should have freaking videotaped that.  Because he kind of was like, and I talked to him very comfortably.  He's a really good guy.  But in that moment, he's kind of in boss mode.  When he said, we'll talk about this offline, it was like, oh, no, Jimmy's going to have  to sit through this meeting on the phone now about the meeting.  Offline.  It's like, uh-oh.  That was good. 
[03:38:00]  You're rarely gotten.  Yeah.  I got to respect that.  That was a good one.  On the way, the hosts, staff, and the guests of the O.P. & Anthony show dish out and take  even more verbal abuse as the worst of O.P. & Anthony's spinning wheel on Haze continues.  I'm Roland, producer Talbucker for the O.P. & Anthony show.  It's bonus time, everyone.  Where we spin the wheel for anyone is game.  Let's see what comes up. 
[03:38:30]  Ooh.  Danny.  Oh, shit.  It's Danny again, son.  This time, we need to eat Taco Bell or Chipotle.  This time, our buddy Laszlo's in the studio and talks about what a pain in the ass it was  to take Danny to a camping trip.  Does Danny end up in another man's sleeping bag?  Stay tuned.  The spinning wheel of Haze.  Are you doing anything Saturday, Lasz?  I am going to be out of town.  Where?  I'm going to be up in Massachusetts. 
[03:39:00]  It's where, I might say, I took Danny, who I felt sorry for because he didn't get promoted  and a bunch of other stuff.  And he was having a terrible week.  He'd ruined your carpet because he's terrible at having a girlfriend.  And Keith had to throw him out and take his keys.  So I said, you know what?  Let me take you camping.  I'm getting some friends together.  We're going to go into the woods up in Massachusetts where I've got a cabin up there. 
[03:39:30]  And it'll be easy.  We'll be like 100 feet from the cabin.  So if the weather's shitty or whatever.  And he asked Keith, this is how much this group of people hate each other.  He asked Keith for a tent.  Keith literally got a tent from his parents from the Korean War.  The instructions were typed out.  I mean, you imagine somebody going, here girl, type this up so the boys in the field know how to put it together.  But it was this, dude, it was so fucking thick. 
[03:40:00]  It was, dude, there were poles on the inside that held it up.  Like a mash tent?  Dude, it was a proper 4077 fucking tent.  Meanwhile, you got those modern, lightweight, fits-in-your-pocket tents.  Exactly.  How long did you camp for?  Just a couple of days.  He was there 30 minutes.  And my friend, who was in his 50s, pulled me aside and goes,  Your friend's really out of shape.  Oh, shit!  Shit! Danny is getting fucking pounded!  These fucking cocks do this shit all the fucking time.  I've never been camping before. 
[03:40:30]  Like, real camping, like where you do shit.  We were walking through the forest.  He's like, I'm really tired.  I'm like, what are you doing?  We're out in nature.  He's like, I can't get a signal.  And then later, you know, we sort of relax in front of the campfire and have some drinks and shoot the shit.  He's like, okay, I wanted to throw his fucking iPhone in the fire.  Because fucking Berlin wasn't checking his phone every two seconds.  No, dude, you are unbelievable.  And here's what happens.  What was he trying to get on the phone?  He's like, I've got to give D-Boy shit.  And I'm like, you're here with me.  See, and this is the thing.  When you go over to Anthony's and his young apprentice, Danny, who's always over there, 
[03:41:00]  you're not spending time with Danny or Anthony.  You're spending time with their iPhone.  That's true.  We will just sit there and text and text and text.  And then the only conversation we really have is, you want another beer?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Glad I came over so I could watch you text bitches.  And they're texting each other.  That's hysterical.  That was the tent that I got to borrow.  That is an old school tent.  Yeah, you could fit like five people in there.  Holy shit, massive. 
[03:41:30]  That doesn't look fun at all.  Meanwhile, he's busting my balls.  His friend had the same exact fucking one.  But he brought it as a joke.  He goes, I got this tent.  That's a joke.  He goes, I had this tent since the 70s.  I want to see if it'll still work.  And by the way, it's not like we just went like on this nice little trail.  Climbing a mountain.  We went eight miles up until it's a mountain.  It's not like climbing a mountain.  It was.  On Friday.  There was some steeps.  It was like climbing a ladder.  On Friday, we went for a hike for literally one hour. 
[03:42:00]  And it was very flat terrain.  30 minutes into it.  Dude, he's huffing up by the sweat pouring down his face.  We're in jeans.  We're in jeans.  It was unseasonably warm last month.  Oh, shit.  And then the next day, we went on the Appalachian Trail.  And I literally thought that we were going to have to carry him.  He was a fucking mess.  Well, look.  When someone invites you to go camping, I thought, to me, camping is you sit by the fire.  That's the other thing.  The beer.  I told him.  I said, everybody brings an assortment of cool beers and stuff. 
[03:42:30]  We sort of share beers and all that.  He shows up with Bud Light.  Nobody drank any of his shitty beer.  More from me.  Oh, but you were happy to try it.  That's a nice exotic beer from Boston.  I'll try that one.  And then on Sunday.  Bud Light cleanses the palate.  On Sunday, everybody leaves, right?  Because normally when you go camping, you wake up pretty early.  Everybody leaves.  And it's just his lone tent in the woods.  And I'm sitting there at 11 o'clock in the morning, noon, going, anytime, Danny. 
[03:43:00]  Danny likes to sleep in.  Wake up and go.  You should just left a tent out there.  Oh, that's great.  How far were you from here?  Three hours.  Except in Western Mass.  And how far of a hike into the woods was it?  What?  Once you park the car, how long do you have to walk?  See, the cars are on the other side of that house.  And they've got their tents in the backyard.  Right.  It's basically tents in the backyard. 
[03:43:30]  We were 12.  And we wanted to sleep outside.  Why don't you sleep in the cabin?  Because it's fun sleeping on the ground where it's really uncomfortable.  Yeah, I would have hated to play Xbox and have heat.  That would suck.  I thought it was unseasonably warm.  And I was like, are you going to be...  And we're on the Appalachian Trail.  And we're about three hours in.  And he's in bad shape.  And I'm like, dude, what's going on?  And he's like, I just go home and rip bong hits and eat Burger King.  He goes, well, yeah. 
[03:44:00]  It's really hard doing morning radio.  I'm like, do nothing.  Do nothing with your body for like two years.  And then do an eight-mile hike on the Appalachian Trail.  Do it.  It was not.  Welcome back.  The vicious verbal beatdown keeps a-coming.  The worst of Opie Anthony presents the spinning wheel of hate.  Welcome back to the spinning wheel of hate.  I'm your host, Roland.  Time to spin the wheel again and see who our next victim is. 
[03:44:30]  Master Poe.  Us.  F.H. Riley's behind the dumpster.  Me, Master Poe.  Former show leech.  Yeah.  Free dinner, man.  Master Poe gets grilled in the following segments for having body...  Oh, man.  I remember when I fart.  Nothing smells worse than Master Poe.  Hooking up with the listeners and fucking behind F.H. Riley's.  He does that a lot.  Master Poe gets in on this. 
[03:45:00]  On the spinning wheel of hate.  Us.  If you're in Florida, run.  He's there, I hear.  The spinning wheel of hate.  You know what I gotta realize?  Danny's starting to get really cocky.  Oh, he is.  I really notice.  He is really stepping forward and saying, I ain't taking you guys' shit too much longer.  I gotta realize one of the...  Ron and Fez have been calling me and I'm ready to jump ship, so don't give me any bunk.  Well, I do have the biggest dumps around here.  He got a little rambunctious this morning, too.  We needed somebody...  See, it's raining here in New York. 
[03:45:30]  It's been raining for a week straight.  And I do not like walking in the rain.  I don't have an umbrella.  I don't want to get soggy and sit here wet and cold like a little puppy all day.  So, I pull up in front of the building and I phone my good friend, Steve C.  That's right.  And say, Steve, I will give you the opportunity to drive a real vehicle and take my Escalade to the parking garage.  A real gas guzzler.  Right.  Exactly.  Uses like a year's worth of gas for his car just driving to the garage. 
[03:46:00]  Exactly.  It's nice.  And Steve drives and parks the car.  And how do you get back when that happens?  Sometimes I walk, sometimes Poe follows me and drives me back.  Oh, I would hope Poe would because it's raining.  No, he's been cool about it.  He's been cool about it.  So, today, it's like, I don't know, the fourth day in a row or whatever it is.  It's the whole week.  The fifth day.  I didn't want to bug Steve because he's a busy guy in the mornings.  It's before the show.  He has better things to do than drive my freaking car around. 
[03:46:30]  So, I decided to make a decision today that Poe will drive my truck around.  It's a great honor to drive my vehicle to the parking garage.  I'll say.  It is something of trust.  I have confidence that Poe has driven my vehicle around.  But, now, what was needed was Poe to drive it around and someone to drive Poe's car to follow my vehicle so Poe can then drive back from the garage.  So, I came up and I was looking for an intern or something to drive Poe's car because, quite frankly, I don't care who drives Poe's car. 
[03:47:00]  They could drive it into a pole for all I care.  So, you know, grab anybody.  No interns.  It was too early.  So, in the office, everybody's doing something.  I guess the least important thing that was being done at that time was being done by Danny.  And Danny just started.  So, you're saying Danny doesn't work hard for him?  He was going.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  No, at the time, if we were doing bit triage in the morning, his patient could have sat there while the other patients were being worked on. 
[03:47:30]  Good way to say it.  This particular morning, you might be right.  But, there are other mornings where his top priority, you know, sucking chest wound is the bit he's working on.  No, I'm not trying to get out of it.  No, I'm not.  You're trying to make something more of this than I am.  We all know we give Danny the easiest stuff in the morning to do.  So, why don't we just bring it to the table now?  Sits at the special ed computer at the end.  The one that doesn't have any real programs on it to do any real work.  Just keep hitting enter over and over.  Yeah, all you hear from that computer is, I'm contributing. 
[03:48:00]  Yes, you are.  I'm contributing to the show.  Because they made us hire a retard.  The reality is, it's fun to make.  He really, Danny really works hard for us.  Of course he does.  He sure does.  Photographing his own shit and all.  Yeah.  I'm producing.  You certainly are.  But he gave a little bit of an attitude this morning. 
[03:48:30]  Like, he didn't want to drive Poe's car.  Like, it was like, yeah, all right.  Like, you could say he was sitting there, he's got his headphones on.  He's hearing the conversation that's going on, that we need somebody to drive.  He's listening.  No one else is coming to the table.  And he's sitting there like, I know it's going to end up on me.  I know.  So then finally when it was like, Danny, you know, drive Poe's car.  He's like, is there a problem with your duties here?  No, not with the duties.  Duties.  Obviously not from the picture I saw. 
[03:49:00]  It's like a fucking plane spelling things.  It looked like an air.  You should be taking shits over Jones Beach.  My dumps, you could easily find, you could find the same thing on Central Park South.  That's huge there.  But the problem.  Thank you.  I'm getting away with that one.  Wow.  He tried to add to it and everything.  That's how huge they are.  But seriously.  But seriously.  And then he trods forward. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Like, he wasn't even trying to do comedy.  Yeah, no, seriously, they're big.  I'm not really trying.  Welcome to the bomb reel.  You got that one with anyone?  Central Park.  What did you do?  Central Park South?  Shut up, Jimmy.  I'm just trying to figure out.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  You're going to take that.  You're going to take that.  You got balls.  Sorry.  So, you know, was there a, there wasn't a problem with, you know, doing that? 
[03:50:00]  No, no.  The task is fine.  Yeah.  The task at hand is fine.  But there is a little, there's a slight.  Eric is back in the studio.  Yeah.  There's a slight odor problem in Poe's car.  With Poe's car.  What's the odor in your car?  Dead bodies?  Poe's?  Is there an odor in your car?  Have people told you your car stinks?  Steve?  Steve has never told me my car stinks.  Smells like dogs.  Well, you can get it in my car. 
[03:50:30]  It takes him about 15 minutes.  There he goes.  If you really want to see how pissed off I can get, why don't you plant one right fucking  here?  Oh.  And when your arm breaks, then.  Well, why does his car smell?  His car smells like dogs.  Yeah.  What dog?  Plant what?  Yeah, plant what?  A fist or kiss?  A smooch.  Because if I'm going to, I'll get an anvil.  I'm not going to use my fist.  Yeah, exactly.  No.  Well, the big issue is I don't want to fucking club anybody.  I'm going to smash Jimmy in the face for making fun of me verbally. 
[03:51:00]  What?  No, I don't want to do that.  Let's hope not.  But why is this anger coming out?  No, it's not.  We're all smashing each other.  Steve, relax.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You just plant one.  How do I articulate this?  Because I'm not retaliating physically, I'm a pussy?  I'm afraid.  No one's calling you a pussy.  He just did.  Steve, relax.  He did.  That was the exact word that came out of his mouth.  He called me a pussy.  Hit him.  That's right.  And just because I'm not around here throwing people out windows means I'm a fucking pussy?  That's pretty much what I was saying. 
[03:51:30]  Wow.  And we're all agreeing.  I think I don't agree with that.  Holy jeez.  Poe was the one who called you out, and I was just acknowledging the fact that it sounded  kind of, you know.  No, Poe just said I didn't say anything.  Yeah, but you've been driving his car a lot.  Or how many times?  Every time I've got to park Ant's car.  Then you park his?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Then I get a ride back to the studio.  Yeah, he's following, and then you've got to ride in it.  Every morning, I follow Steve to park Ant's car, and I bring him back to the studio. 
[03:52:00]  Whether it rains, it doesn't matter.  I want to make sure that he gets back to the studio all the time.  Of course.  And he never complained, not once.  No?  Not once.  Well, it's hard.  Not a pee-pee left.  Because we have the show on, we talk, you know, about, you know.  You don't want to, like, say, you know, it's awkward.  It's embarrassing.  You don't want to sit there and go, wow, your car stinks.  Unless you bring it up, like, immediately.  You get in and go, whoa, this car stinks.  But after you've driven a while, it kind of builds up.  It's hard to confront somebody.  I don't think he smells it anymore.  I think he's used to it. 
[03:52:30]  Are you?  Are you?  What, the dog smell?  Yeah.  I have a dog, so I know what that smell is.  You don't really like it, though, do you?  No, it's not all lessons.  I know what dog smell is.  That's why I'm.  I got in the elevator, and the whole thing smelled like dog liquid.  No one on it.  It's like, when they're wet, it's awful.  Wet dog people with their stupid dogs.  Oh, in the elevator, in their cars.  Exactly.  In your apartments.  In your home.  You're stinking it up.  Your basement. 
[03:53:00]  Can we bring this back around?  Yeah.  First of all, Steve, I'm sorry I called you a pussy.  It's okay.  You look all set.  I don't like the fact that he yelled it out, though, and didn't tell Master Poe that he  should plant one.  Plant one.  Oh, if Master Poe hits me, it's going to be a rough fight, because Poe can probably do  a number on me, but I'll get some good hits in.  Wow.  Yeah, your head on the floor.  Holy shit.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Or one wrong word from a massive fight in the studio.  It really is. 
[03:53:30]  You can feel the tension.  I am so tired of being called a pussy.  I might just fucking...  Don't get all upset.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, it's like...  Listen, I don't mean to interrupt you, faggot.  But I wound up...  Oh, Jesus.  Are you fucking kidding?  Can I not talk?  I just...  I wound up being mad, man.  He no longer hates me.  That's all I care about.  I was cranky when I came in.  Now he's focused on you.  It's the weather.  I was sweating there for a while.  What?  He was mad?  Yeah, no.  He's a little hot.  He gets a little hot.  He forgot all about me.  He gets a little hot under the slip.  Oh. 
[03:54:00]  Oh.  But I wound up coming in a very bad mood, and I think everybody has an odd mood today.  Yeah.  Steve, I have a great fear of you, by the way.  I don't want people to be afraid.  I have no problem.  I don't want people to be afraid.  Then I...  For you, when you come in that day with a high-powered rifle and start  walking around, I want to be the guy that you pointed...  I want to be the guy that's interviewed later, that said, he pointed it right at me.  He thought about it.  And then smiled, nodded, and walked away, and shot Opie right in the head.  I'm not going to shoot Opie.  Like, that's... 
[03:54:30]  I'm not going to shoot Opie.  I'm not going to shoot Opie.  Hold on.  Would I be the first one you shoot?  No.  If you had to, would I be the first one you shoot?  I wouldn't shoot you.  God.  In order...  No, if you had to.  You're coming in.  You're the disgruntled employee.  No, no.  You're coming in.  Who you shoot first, because you're not that much anger toward.  You'd be first.  Steve's going to give this order.  Who can fire me the least...  Who has the least firing power?  Yeah.  All the interns get shot first.  Okay.  That's actually accurate.  You have a room full of dead interns, and... 
[03:55:00]  Wouldn't you shoot me first?  No.  Why do you want to hurt Opie?  Who would you shoot?  Who's first?  Who's first?  See, this is where you get the label of the P word.  You have to at least answer this question.  Yeah.  I'm thinking.  I'm looking around.  Who would you shoot first if you were the disgruntled employee?  I'd shoot Eric first.  Do I have to shoot people?  That's really the only option?  I'll be honest.  I'd shoot Eric first.  If I went completely crazy, came in with a gun, and just everyone was available to shoot,  because you'd probably just shoot the first person you see, you know, kind of make a statement. 
[03:55:30]  But if I looked and everyone was available to shoot, I'd probably just shoot Eric.  Nothing personal.  Just, you're very shootable.  And he's the easiest one to blame, because they go, why'd you do it?  You could just open your mouth, and some reason would fly out that was accurate.  But the TV had the wrong shit on it.  Well, that did happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve.  If I had to go in order of...  A disgruntled employee.  A disgruntled employee.  A disgruntled employee.  A disgruntled employee.  A disgruntled employee.  A disgruntled employee.  You're coming in with a gun.  And your objective is to wipe out as many of your coworkers as possible.  You don't have to give it that much thought.  Just, you come in, you're angry.  Yeah, because who's the one you shoot first? 
[03:56:00]  The first person I'm going to see if I walk in with a gun is this guy.  He's Poe.  It's got to be Poe.  So Poe goes down first.  You have to take him out first.  You've got to take out Poe first.  So you can take out the rest of the office.  So you can take out everybody else.  But it's like, no, it's like a video game.  He's the boss, and he's in that room with the Kevlar and the bulletproof glass, and you  can't access him until you wipe out a few other people and can get to the switch.  Then you're going after stormtroopers, basically.  So you have to go out, you have to go through a roundup.  Picture Steve there with a fucking rifle, and Poe just going, hold on.  Who would you shoot first?  Who gets it?  Hmm. 
[03:56:30]  Who gets it?  I guess, you know, it's a toss-up.  If Danny's in the way, Danny takes a bullet.  Danny.  Why Danny?  Where's everybody on me today?  Well, you're in the room.  You're just the first person I saw.  I just shot Eric.  Yeah, you shot Eric.  Your name didn't even come up.  And I should tell you now that I so considered you first.  Why?  I don't know.  It just popped in my head.  I'm sorry, guys.  I don't mean to mess up this bit, but you won't get through.  What do you mean?  Windows and doors and walls and...  Ugh.  Jesus.  Wow, that was... 
[03:57:00]  You missed the car crash.  It was a car crash?  Yeah, there's dog fur that's just flooded.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right, well, that would have been a great bit for another 20 minutes.  Oh, well, we're done with that one.  No, it's all right.  No, it's all right.  It's cool.  So where were we?  Danny?  Danny, right.  Part your car.  But, no, no, Danny followed in Poe's car.  Right.  And then they drove back together, and Danny, I guess, had a problem with the fragrance of Poe's car.  It's a little funky. 
[03:57:30]  A little funky.  Is it dog?  I suppose.  Yeah.  I suppose.  I know that Poe does have a few dogs.  What kind of dogs are they?  Three dogs.  What kind?  Bulldogs.  Oh, so they slobber a lot.  Big dog balls.  No?  They're just big.  Big dog balls.  Their tails poke straight up, so their assholes rub on the seat.  You don't even get the tail protection.  People are amazing at their fucking dogs.  They hop up on the couch at their house and stuff, and their actual asshole, where the dog shit comes from, is on the couch. 
[03:58:00]  And then people will lay there with their face on the couch, where the dog asshole was just, like, rubbing.  Put your face on your dog's asshole, because that's what you're doing.  My dogs have their own couch.  Your dogs have their own couch.  Yeah, they have their own couch, yeah.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Fabulous.  We're done with the car thing?  The spinning wheel of hate.  Did you happen to tune in at all?  To the Pal Talk pajama party the girls had? 
[03:58:30]  No.  I tuned in for a little while.  I think it was on Saturday night.  Saturday night.  Yeah, I think I was out Friday night.  I don't remember.  Yeah, Saturday night, so I tune in.  And, you know, there's a couple of the hot girls from Pal Talk running around.  And then, I don't know who else they brought.  There were some filler girls, let's just say.  Some filler girls in there.  They were doing, like, because it was in Happy Typing Girls. 
[03:59:00]  One of the girls, she threw the whole thing.  And she works at a photography studio.  So a few of them were by the area where they do the pictures, doing little photo shoots,  like laying down in their little pajamas and stuff, doing photo shoots.  And then you'd be watching that.  And then you'd go to another camera.  And there's stalker Patty with her jaw open.  Because apparently when she types and reads on the computer, she has to open her mouth 
[03:59:30]  and stare like a mongoloid.  So all you see is her face in the camera typing.  I wanted to punch my monitor.  I actually did talk to, I forgot at the end of the night, I did talk to Happy Typing Girl  and a couple of others.  And she said it was a big smash, but they were all in bed by the time I talked to her.  Really?  What time did they go to bed?  I was late.  It was like 5 in the morning.  It must have been late.  They were all drinking, though, which was good.  So this was live on Pal Talk? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  Was there nudity?  How were the PJs?  I didn't see any nudity.  Some of them more revealing than others, which was good.  They were wowing.  So they were showing some breasts.  And then the more they drank, the more they wrestled with each other, too.  There was a lot of girl wrestling going on.  But where they're in their PJs pinning each other down and things like that, doing their  photo shoots together, kind of hugging each other and stuff.  So that was kind of cool.  Yeah.  This is not just a radio show anymore.  It's like, I don't know, a lifestyle. 
[04:00:30]  It's a cult.  It's kind of like a cult.  It's an experience that continues after we go off the air.  And I guess through the Pal Talk cameras, they had a little sleepover party that people  were able to check out all over the country.  Girls had the slumber party.  It was a four-camera shoot going on in there.  So they really had a lot of coverage on the place.  And yeah, you could just pop in and watch it.  I told her she would have turned Patty away.  I told her that would have been so great.  She shows up with her bags and her high hopes for a fun weekend of chips and laughter and 
[04:01:00]  just send her home.  Beat it, aunt.  I would have liked it if the first time she got on camera, they poured pig blood all over  her.  Carrie.  Is it true that Master Poe volunteered his services for the party?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, Master Poe said because, you know, well, ladies, you've announced this  on the air.  Perhaps I could go and give you security.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, I guess he would believe that.  That is the sorriest excuse to get into a pajama party full of girls that I've ever heard. 
[04:01:30]  God bless Mr. Poe.  Poe.  Poe.  It wasn't even like it was something that you were trying.  You didn't even try to come up with something.  He also made the same offer to McGreevy years ago.  You know, you're going to the bathroom at late at night.  It's very dangerous.  It would be very dangerous in those bookstores, gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  No, gentlemen, I'm very protective when it comes to women, and I did offer my services.  Why?  I didn't want anything.  Why did you really offer your services? 
[04:02:00]  Because that's the way I am.  Have you seen what happens?  It's occasionally guys with masks that are stretched and have big mouths stab these women  to death.  I've watched movies.  They need security.  So what were you going to do?  Where were you going to stand?  Well, there's two different rooms.  You are not going to admit on the show that it was more than just security?  I wouldn't.  They were safe?  Gentlemen, I wouldn't be out in the open.  I would be underneath the desks the girls are using to type.  That way, the perpetrators would not see me.  It's just in. 
[04:02:30]  There's going to be a gay slumber party, and they're looking for your services.  Are you going to help them out?  Yeah, Paul, would you help them out?  No, that's okay.  Guys can take care of those.  Say, that's what I'm saying.  And at least admit that there was an ulterior motive.  Ulterior motive?  Of course.  Are you kidding?  It was a pajama party with mostly hot girls from Pal Talk.  I volunteered my nose in case a chair broke.  And do you know that happy typing girl was too scared to tell you no?  Really?  She was afraid of me.  Yes, she was.  She wanted to say no, but she couldn't.  Which, what happened?  Now it's out there. 
[04:03:00]  You shouldn't fear the Poe unless you have something to fear of the Poe.  The Poe's not dangerous.  Well, when he first told me about this, he was asking me who this girl was, and he said,  oh, I offered my services for the party.  Then he proceeded to tell me that his logic for it was that, you know, all these girls  that are in the room there, every guy's going to know where they are, so they'll just start  showing up, and I'll run the door and screen the door so they don't come in.  Do you know where that is?  No.  No idea.  Do you know where that is?  Yes.  Jimmy probably does.  Anyone else that's been on Pal Talk, do you have any idea where that studio is that she 
[04:03:30]  does Pal Talk from every day, and this party was at?  No.  This just in.  There was a serious threat of a pillow fight breaking out.  Gentlemen, I wanted to be there.  Were you going to bring some fluffy nunchucks and hit the girls with them?  Hey, pillows are sharp sometimes.  You can put an eye out.  I don't blame Paul.  I'm not saying he's right.  I do.  I don't blame him at all.  No one even knew where the party was.  I don't blame him because I know he had a complete ulterior motive.  Oh, okay.  He actually thought anyone was going to fall for this security thing at a pajama party 
[04:04:00]  that no one knows where it's even at.  That no one knows, yeah.  It's in a warehouse somewhere, basically.  It's like NORAD.  They were holding the party at NORAD.  Hey, can I help, gentlemen?  Perhaps, uh...  So were you at the party?  No.  No.  What happened?  Did you watch any of the party?  Uh, no.  I didn't go.  You didn't go.  No?  Well, she emailed me and she said that, uh, she didn't need my service.  She finally got the...  I finally got the, you know what, uh, to tell you. 
[04:04:30]  Poe, Poe, if you were concerned of their safety, though, couldn't you have watched the entire  thing on PalTalk and if you saw something happen, be the first one to dial the authorities?  Um, no, I don't watch PalTalk.  See, why wouldn't...  I don't watch PalTalk.  But that would have been being, that would have been keeping them safe.  I feel that if I'm there, present, if I'm in the room, or outside of the room, in the  area, I...  He was gonna walk the perimeter.  Much more...  I heard he was gonna just walk the perimeter.  The spitting wheel of hate. 
[04:05:00]  Master Poe, in, in, in, in, with all due respect, Poe, you kinda would run after a female dog  because it's female.  ...place to, to be a little flirtatious.  Well, let's just...  Uh, to look at a lot of the girls and stuff, so it's hard to really gauge how much, you know,  if you're just being Poe, you know?  Let's just put it this way, he does a lot of his dating in the back parking lot at FH  right here.  Oh, shit!  Jesus!  Why is everyone looking away? 
[04:05:30]  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, Poe, the FH doesn't mean fuck here.  No, you didn't!  No, you didn't!  Poe, Poe, Boo, Boe, Banana, Nana.  Banana, Fana, Fo-Fo, Fee-Fi, Mo-Mo, Poe!  Oosh!  The Spitting Wheel of Hate! 
[04:06:00]  Well, that's all the time we have today for the Spitting Wheel of Hate.  I've been your host, Roland.  Good night, everyone.  Bruce!  Yeah!  That's it for the worst of O.P. Anthony presents  The Spitting Wheel of Hate! </pre>
