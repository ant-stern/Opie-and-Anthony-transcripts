<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  The show began with a detailed discussion of a viral video showing a Seattle police officer arresting two women, focusing on whether the officer's actions, particularly a punch to one woman's face, were justified.  Patrice appeared in a video shown on Opie's YouTube channel contributing to this discussion.  Callers, including a California police officer and a former New York State Trooper (Brendan), offered their perspectives, highlighting the chaotic nature of the arrest and the media's potentially incomplete portrayal of events. The women's minor criminal records were mentioned, as was the officer's subsequent reassignment.  The hosts debated the use of force continuum in police training and the potential racial implications highlighted by Reverend Al Sharpton's anticipated commentary (which was planned to air later in the show).  Another caller, Jennaro from Buffalo, also contributed to this discussion.

The conversation then took a sharp turn into a raunchier, nostalgic recounting of past broadcasts, featuring explicit details and photographs of past segments, including a recurring gag involving a woman throwing eggs from her vagina.  They discussed the aging process of the women involved in these stunts. This transitioned into a review of the latest Tiger Woods golf game, criticized for its lack of innovation, and a comparison with the iPhone 4's immediate popularity versus Blackberry and other competing devices.

Following this, the show delved into a series of loosely connected tangents.  The discussion started with a humorous anecdote about a naked skydiver and the physics of a flailing penis in freefall, rapidly escalating into vulgar discussions about sex and public sex. Opie shared a harrowing scuba diving experience, followed by a discussion of pornography and a video depicting a couple having sex while rock climbing.  A heated argument erupted between Opie and Anthony, punctuated by insults and accusations. A caller, Kyle, shared a skydiving story, followed by a racially insensitive exchange about the term "Oriental." The hosts then recounted their sex dreams, with Opie detailing a bizarre dream involving a fat woman, a naked woman, and his penis ending up in the snow.  The segment concluded with discussions about hair plugs, bald celebrities, Opieâ€™s altercation with his former mother-in-law's dog, the destruction of his mother-in-law's knick-knacks, an upcoming Red Bull air race, Opie's experience flying a plane,  *Torgasm*, and the Showtime documentary *I Am Comic*.

A subsequent segment focused on Bobby Kelly's emotional state, his therapy, and his use of a positivity app.  This was interspersed with repeated clips from a James Cagney film featuring violent and misogynistic scenes, particularly focusing on the brutal treatment of a female character. A 911 call about a Bigfoot sighting was played, followed by a call from a man who shot his wife. Bobby Kelly engaged in several impromptu, highly offensive rap performances throughout the segment.  The hosts discussed a shark-catching show and a caller shared a local legend of a smaller cryptid, "Nobby."  A person named Sam also unexpectedly appeared in this segment.

The final segment discussed an upcoming appearance by one of the hosts with Ann Coulter on Jimmy Norton's show.  The hosts expressed extreme disdain for past guest appearances by Voss and an unnamed guest, using highly offensive language to describe their poor performances. They concluded by promoting an upcoming appearance on Jimmy Norton's "Raw Dog" show with Al Jackson as a guest, expressing their positive feelings towards Norton as a co-host and plans for future collaborations.  The broadcast maintained a consistently chaotic, profane, and unrestrained tone throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  our show is stupid this is so irresponsible this should be illegal it really should be  it's like it's so unethical god i hate fucking radio this could be the worst audio ever  shut up shut your fucking mouth this is terrible we just suck all around i hope you show restraint 
[00:00:30]  in fucking my girlfriend this stinks fucking shut the fuck up we get it get it but enough of this  palaver let's get the show on the road are you fucking kidding me where did the time go  we got the whole gang in here i should have filmed that that's classic i should have filmed that we 
[00:01:00]  have the whole gang in here we're shooting the shit we're laughing we're joking talking about  an email i got overnight where i got had by a drug company holy shit that was that was hysterical  it's like the second you turned on the sound of the show it went enough of this palaver  yeah the we're watching tv i got my feet up i don't even have my computers on i haven't even  eaten breakfast yet i was like quick but we're all just kind of kind of getting along that was 
[00:01:30]  kind of nice yeah and all of a sudden yeah like ann said i went from live tv to i wonder where the  channel's at at this moment wonder how much time we got left enough of this palaver well the answer  would be no time whatsoever we have to start cold like this none time so good morning welcome to the  opian anthony show i'm not prepared anthony's sort of prepared but guess what we'll make it work like 
[00:02:00]  we usually do all right um we'll be i't man i was thinking about that that seattle police officer  yeah this story's got some heat story story uh by the way anthony i i i happen i happen to film  us discussing that yesterday me you patrice oh i saw that yeah oh you did see it and uh club  soda candy i put it up on my youtube channel op radio there's a nice little insight on the workings  of the show i tried i mean it was a very long video i had to edit the shit out of it but you know 
[00:02:30]  because no one wants to sit through a 12 minute fucking youtube clip ever it could be the greatest  clip ever you don't want to sit through that shit but uh the discussion that is being had  in the comments section of that video very very interesting oh really yeah i mean racist unfortunately  you know a lot of people have pea brains and they just go for the the race shit instead of really  trying to discuss it intelligently but uh whatever those people help make the world go around so what 
[00:03:00]  are you going to do with that uh but you might want to go there and and join the conversation it's  pretty fucking intense oh yeah i saw a few of the comments but uh and what's interesting about  our angle on this we had anthony who who's very passionate yes when it comes to race issues  and we had patrice very passionate when it comes to race issues and uh and you know what i think i think  i think patrice agreed with you yesterday i really do in the end i think he agreed i think as a black guy 
[00:03:30]  he he wanted to be on the side of uh the black girls i i really believe that which is the shame  about the black community i think he was feeling like man i think i got to stick up for these broads  but then when he saw the video he realized that i think he said it best when he said i don't think  she's being black i think she's being a woman yeah yeah that's what he said yep and uh yeah i think  she was uh kind of being she was just being i don't know i think it's a little bit of both  there's this total lack of respect for the law that goes on and um oh she was she was a prime 
[00:04:00]  example of a lot of shit you see and uh it was also a situation that you you just said the guy  seemed a little inexperienced well i i do want to say that i don't know what his record is as far as  how long he was on the force or anything i i watched the video a lot last night and i think patrice  said it uh perfectly yesterday he said that the guy's not experienced with police police uh however  he put it police stuff or police stuff on how to take a bitch down right so he was in a he was in 
[00:04:30]  a situation that he was losing big time yeah so he he used whatever he could to calm the situation down  and unfortunately for him because he's in all sorts of trouble they already what we uh relocated him  or something reassign him reassign him or something i have no idea yet he decided to go for the punch to  the face to stop her great move and it worked great move it shut her right the fuck up and then  embarrassingly he struggled with the other one for what seemed like an eternity before he got the cuffs 
[00:05:00]  on her here's what i think uh that guy put yourself in his situation had no idea if he was going to be  at the very least punched because uh boy some people are the king of that fucking round the back of  the head sucker punch to the side of the face right uh and at the very uh worst have his gun  fucking taken out uh of his holster and shot right uh then this this dumb bitch comes over to try to 
[00:05:30]  help her friend out who is the one being arrested and now the cop is like he can't concentrate on  taking the one girl down right so now he's got to go over to the girl in the pink shirt and get rid of  that problem immediately which is a punch to the fucking face and we were calling her pinky and  her boyfriend even knew that it was a bad idea but pinky uh very clearly in the long form video  by the way the stupid media they they suck a dick because they're not showing no they're not showing 
[00:06:00]  you the whole story why would they uh the boyfriend is holding back pinky yeah and pinky's like fuck that  yep i'm getting involved he shakes loose of the right boyfriend the boyfriend you can see in his  face like ah shit this isn't gonna be good he knew here it comes here it comes so everyone's  talking about this video and we're gonna get the audio reverend al is not seeing it your way anthony  is not seeing it patrice's way is not seeing it in a logical way he's uh he's completely carrying on 
[00:06:30]  about this one let's say uh angel l rosenthal and our friend marilyn ellis levias  angel rosenthal rosenthal and a friend they both are and ellen yeah ellen levias they both have  criminal records which you know whatever uh they're 27 17 and 19 years old what are their criminal  records i mean i stole pumpkins once you know yeah well what kind of criminal records that's 
[00:07:00]  very vague anthony that's not fair it could be some basic shoplifting shoplifting i'm pretty sure  these these uh it wasn't uh steely pumpkins yeah around halloween because you're a college kid and  you're poor and you're you're drunk and you thought it was a good idea at the time walsh 39 he's been  on the job i guess about four years and uh is temporarily placed in the department's training unit to  allow him to allow him to review his tactics uh all right i got no problem with that if they want to 
[00:07:30]  you know smooth things over and well and have him review his tactics logically if this police officer  continues and every arrest he's punching someone in the face yeah that would be funny a problem it's  like they just keep showing dashboard cams of him punching anyone in the face no matter what happens  right he just loves punching people in the face i mean the cops still get the job done by doing the  the police the police moves the police moves look official yeah the punch in the face not so much  i think it was hard for him to do the real like what he i think what he wanted to do was to take 
[00:08:00]  that woman down to the ground take her down on the ground yeah but i think he knew if he did that  there would have been even more fucking shit and he would have been in an even even more vulnerable  position uh for the bystanders uh that were on kenny uh he stepped up to the mic that cop is  very lucky he didn't get his ass kicked yeah i mean that when you see all the bystanders that  were watching surrounding him yeah you know he's very lucky someone didn't jump in and sucker punch 
[00:08:30]  him like yeah the sucker punch uh and and that's gotta be on his mind during this entire incident so  he can't concentrate all of his uh uh strengths and and what he wants to do on that one bitch that  he's trying to fucking put down right and cuff yeah i mean you know when you're in that situation  you know you're you're fearful and your instincts just take over yeah and you know someone else comes 
[00:09:00]  in on you he's not thinking you know it's unfortunate that he punched that girl in the face but you know  he was doing what he had to do to survive is it unfortunate well yeah because he he's gonna go  to hell for this oh because he's yeah yeah okay because what's gonna happen that girl probably  got locked up for like uh a couple hours assault resisting interfering right she's gonna counter  charge him with assault all right so that's deployed so they wash everything at court but then there's  gonna be the civil suit uh yes the civil suit and the town will probably settle because it's cheaper 
[00:09:30]  to settle than litigate you know that was a very uh nice punch she took it'll give her a few bucks  in her pocket i don't know was it i mean uh he she didn't even go down yeah i mean that kid  the guy the guy's got to work on his police work he better start doing some push-ups yeah yeah yeah i  mean what what the struggle at the end with the other ones like it was embarrassing i'll tell you  though in fairness though get her fucking cuffed already when when people don't want to get locked 
[00:10:00]  up and the adrenaline's flowing it's tough right it's tough sometimes it's easy to sit here in  front of a microphone and go god i looked easy but i guess when you're in the field yeah what  happened to the video with you guys with those those girl cops oh right tried to get i was out of  shape where's that i had a big fucking beer belly i know i took at least at least six years off from  the gym oh that was bad i i dare them to do it again oh oh really where is that video i'll i'll 
[00:10:30]  fucking tweet that today i don't care but no like when you find me that fucking video off your stupid  website i want to tweet it today me and anthony did this bit no i'm gonna explain now kenny yes we  had female cops come in we were being cocky we had a contest to see who could resist the rest uh  the longest yeah with female cops on us with cuffs and man they fucking did their jobs they really did  i had a knee in the back of my neck yeah and uh my arm was twisted behind my back and i uh capitulated 
[00:11:00]  i definitely gave up very quickly i don't understand this get your fucking hands off me attitude  that goes on i i don't get it it's a if if you comply put your fucking hands behind your back  and get cuffed that you're not going to have this drama this perpetual need for drama with the  police is part of the fucking problem it really is it's that's the world the society we live in 
[00:11:30]  because uh some people teach their kids from very early age yes that you know the police are the enemy  the enemy the bad guy and you must resist it uh any turn and it just it makes scenes like that i mean  this is this the first time we've seen this this resisting arrest bullshit that like with with women  too i mean uh um i've seen a lot of things with men you get these big burly fucking white guys that 
[00:12:00]  don't want to be taken down and they're swinging at the cops and and the cops gotta you know pull out  some um hardware or whatever they need to to put this guy down but there's something about the  african-american woman when she is being uh arrested i'm not saying all of course i bet 99  percent are uh fine they just get out of the cars but there's just this disproportionate number  that really do not uh it's like this get your hands off it like you don't you don't touch me 
[00:12:30]  and it's like no they do touch you right and they fucking cuff you and they put you in the car  and and it's not going to stop because you're fighting they're not going to just stop and say  okay you can go home now get it through your fucking head well but but there's your update the  fucking guy is uh reassigned and he's going to go through some training and this is going to be an  ugly mess political move right there by the way of course and you got uh reverend al on the case we're  gonna get we're gonna get the audio what is we're gonna get the audio on the radio in a few minutes 
[00:13:00]  what does al have to say let's uh involve the listeners here let's go to matt in california  why don't you put your headphones on there kenny matt yeah i'm here hey buddy what's up uh you know  what dude i'm a cop out of california i'm just getting off work i listen to you guys all the time  on the way home and uh you know interesting thing is you got to take in the totality of the situation  and it's the stupid media never does no they played one clip yeah they played a 10 second 
[00:13:30]  clip what they don't take into effect or into uh i don't know take account for is uh the fact that  he's got all those people surrounding him he's already trying to handle one stupid ass and then  the other stupid ass comes up he's got to take care of business and then you also got to take  into stuff that they won't report on such as that intersection had three homicides in the last  month oh really that's nice are obviously fucking shit that's nice i wonder i wonder i gotta stop you  i wonder if reverend al mentioned that last night i got when he was ranting and raving about this 
[00:14:00]  situation in seattle do you know how we barely would have heard about this if that cop was fucking  stabbed uh by somebody while he tried to do this you it would be like you you wouldn't see the video  of the stabbing they would never show that uh but you'd kind of hear it you'd hear about it  on uh on the news they'd say oh yeah an officer was stabbed while trying to make an arrest  and you wouldn't hear anything about it but instead you hear uh you got one woman resisting  her dumb ass friend coming over to fucking do something push the cop away from her friend 
[00:14:30]  uh which is interfering with an arrest and and she gets popped in the fucking mug  and she got exactly what she fucking deserved no more no less and it was a dumb thing too wasn't  a jaywalking or something yeah some basic little pullover and she decided she didn't want to  fucking go along with what he was telling her to say all right matt i gotta thank you i gotta give  some other people a chance here uh someone wants to know kenny i don't want to go to the phone on  this one why didn't the cop uh pull out his piece in this situation jesus no i don't know you pull out 
[00:15:00]  a piece to does that calm people down i don't fucking know i'm not a police guy i for i remember  when i was a rookie cop all right and the first time i pulled my gun on somebody and pointed to  him because i figured like was it al capone no no no no that you figured that would stop everybody  that'll control the situation right the fucking shittims know you can't shoot them the fucking  guy just ran away from me and i stood there like an asshole and had to run after him so so basically 
[00:15:30]  what you're saying the people you deal with yeah they know they know you're not going to shoot  the shittims know the law but he's just as good as the cops do wow see i learned something today  stupid me i'm thinking you pull out a gun as a cop everyone just freezes in the movies yeah in the  movies only the movies they know run they know and that's a little much that's a little uh excessive  for that situation let me say hi to ed on long island ed hey guys good morning ed hey i just wanted 
[00:16:00]  to say that um you know cops have to win you can't lose the fight and uh you're not going to fight  fair if someone pushes you you're not going to push them back you gotta you you gotta go punch them  and if someone tries to punch you you're not going to you know punch them back you're going to go to  the next weapon you're going to use a metal baton or a wooden uh you know a wooden stick and if someone  comes at you with a stick you're going to you know go to another weapon a gun you know you have to  win that fight and it's not going to be a fair fight yeah it's uh the cops have a lot more to lose 
[00:16:30]  if they lose the fight right then then the perp does and every fight is a gun fight because you  brought the gun to the fight if you lose you lose that gun yeah yeah you're right we wouldn't even be  talking about this if it wasn't a punch if it was some kind of you know accepted police or if it was a  guy hold or something or if it was a guy or if it was a guy correct just because she's a a woman  there's now this problem uh but the thing is she jumped in there and she was treated like a person 
[00:17:00]  she was treated like a human that walked into a situation and uh did something she shouldn't have  been doing and and got a a fist to the face and it's not like he kept wailing on her he popped her in  the face that situation was taken care of he didn't have to worry about her jumping in anymore  that was it so good there you go good there you go i wish we had the reverend alf oh i cannot wait 
[00:17:30]  we'll have it in a few minutes that dummy oh you think he'll come down on the side of the cop  and say that uh no that uh people uh his constituency and people in in the community have to realize that  uh police officers yeah you can't brawl with them and oh my god who is this getting pinned  man 30 seconds  we're gonna have to two cops trying to cuff me 
[00:18:00]  all right kenny jesus what do you mean i got cuffed really quick wasn't that regular radio  somebody yelled out 30 seconds holy shit because we got away with murder back then  like jesus christ i i was trying to teach uh jason ellis i'm like jason enjoy being under the radar  my friend because when you're on the radar it's all over yeah we we got away with murder because no  one knew who we were it's great no one was paying attention we were cursing we were doing all sorts of

[00:29:00]  looking at uh she wants a little a current picture of i guess chrissy oh my god look at her that looks  like a man yeah that looks like a fucking man a man in drag right there that looks like there a  fucking man looks like someone that could have been could be playing for leonard skinner it's like  robin williams yeah yeah i was trying to figure out really long hair hello um mrs doubtfire oh with  her hair down it's uh philip seymour hoffman's getting her autograph yeah yeah that guy doesn't 
[00:29:30]  like to well wow what the fuck they uh they storyboarded that movie and they showed the  shark like in every fucking scene where the shark was involved and it just broke down so much  that they couldn't use the fucking shark well i know 99 of the shit they wanted to but that's  who made the movie the better movie see they weren't they weren't brilliant filmmakers yeah  they weren't they lucked out because if you saw the shark the whole time that movie probably would  have been a joke movie yeah it would have been like oh but they had a film around the fact that 
[00:30:00]  the shark didn't work which which enhanced what you were seeing and the fear and all that and and  makes it the great movie you never got they lucked out if you if you time how many times you  actually see that fucking shark in the movie it's not even a few seconds it's like nothing  well i'm in the long scene at the end so it's probably a few minutes total what with him chomping  on um quint yeah that's not even a long scene no really it's on the back of the boat and that you 
[00:30:30]  really take it into consideration it's a fraction of what the whole movie is about but when you see the  barrels going you know you don't see the shark you see the barrels moving when chrissy gets pulled  underwater you were supposed to see the shark and her actually in the shark's mouth and her no nothing  there's another picture of her she's she's sitting in a roped off area with the buoy with the bell on it  and the poster of young her behind her the jaws poster next to that and they're i guess interviewing 
[00:31:00]  her at one of these conventions you know what she doesn't she's all right she's an all right for  an old she looks like an old hippie grandma yeah but the comparison is really depressing hippie grandma  yeah i wonder what those those ample titties look like now just flapjacks of i don't think she could  run naked down the beach anymore no without falling over because she can't balance herself yeah  oh god that's awful we're kind of stalling because i wanted to play the reverend al audio 
[00:31:30]  i don't know if that's gonna happen you know we could take an earlier break so i can fucking eat  we could do that can we do that i don't think my sandwich is in you want to wait for your sambo  the second my sandwich arrives hey by the way i'm looking at our prep sheet yeah 16 years ago  the oj fucking chase went down look at that holy 16 years ago today we all watched that white bronco  except for you fucking youngsters out there you were sucking on your mom's tits but most of us were 
[00:32:00]  watching the goddamn uh bronco being chased i had a gig that night at uh top of the town  top of the town fast eddies fast eddies my uh sister's father-in-law bought that place yeah i i was i was i  was gigging there that night and um no one was watching the band if they the tv was on of course  you could have been zeppelin no one really really no one really cared no man that was unbelievable  one of the greatest fucking tv things ever but it sure inspired the oj song right there and then 
[00:32:30]  and that i'm i'm we're playing i'm looking at joe we're trying to gig and oj's in the the truck and  the slow speed chase and i was inspired right then i was like you know there's a song parody here  i'll never have to work hard again this will be my ticket to fucking freedom  fucking dated piece of shit what a hack it really isn't dated uh pearl in vegas it's not 16 years  dated pearl yes hey pearl what's up hi guys how are you you were just talking about the girl 
[00:33:00]  that starred in jaws uh not starred she was in she was in the movie for a minute yeah chrissy  she started the whole movie though yeah she did start the movie uh some of us went out on a dive  boat out of ventura california about 10 years ago and she was a cook she was a cook on the dive boat  yeah the peace peace dive boat out of ventura california we went out to uh the islands uh diving 
[00:33:30]  for two days yeah and uh she was there that was her wow that's depressing but then again i mean i  don't think she ever worked again right i don't think so no i don't know about the movies but i  don't think she did anything like i said it was over 10 years ago yeah you know who else uh they  showed uh kitner boy's mother that slapped uh brody in the face and she says people people ask her  to have her slap them in the face oh really she wants yeah people want her to slap them in the 
[00:34:00]  face so they could say that she was slapped and she looked the same age as chrissy well they probably  aged her for the movie i'm thinking yeah and then she's probably a lot younger she starts repeating  the dialogue which was just like douche chili i hate people that are known for one thing yeah yeah and  then and then they ride out that one thing for the rest of their lives that's got to be a miserable  existence i don't care think about it she's sitting there all old and she's going like  you knew you knew there was a shark out there and then they interspliced it with the movie footage 
[00:34:30]  all right oh could you just not be doing this please like a good example it could be a good bit  tommy two-tone has been talking about eight six seven five three oh nine for 20 some odd years he's  got to be out of his mind well he certainly is because he's dead oh tommy died i do believe tommy  two-tone is dead no when did that when did that happen you're kidding how did it happen  oh well then he's probably relieved that he doesn't have to talk about that stupid number 
[00:35:00]  anymore yeah i don't think he has to worry about that i didn't know that uh pearl thank you  thank we're gonna go to eric and uh is he dead we better be sure of this did someone did someone  actually are you from princeton new jersey what i live in brick i work in princeton so brick is on the  sure well i just want to let the listeners know that somebody spelled princeton p-r-i-n-s-t-o-n  uh they wouldn't get in with that spelling wow who who spelled that troy doesn't know how to spell 
[00:35:30]  that's good no we don't need him for his spelling though go ahead eric no i saw the documentary as  well my wife uh gasped when that lady came on christy and i i commented that she looked like she'd  been in the water since the movie and that jaws would not eat that now you hear that and uh you're  trying to talk about how her titties would look oh yeah yeah wouldn't you yeah i'm thinking tube  sock with sand in it imagine they redo the the movie and the shark just keeps circling and circling 
[00:36:00]  and circling doesn't want anything doesn't want anything to do anything to do with the current  version of chrissy is he alive yeah i i i could wait a minute i was surprised when you said tom i'm sorry  eric your fucking phone call could have been a good one but now we're distracted i'm really sorry  video all right man is tommy two-tone dead there must have been a rumor i didn't hear that tommy  two-tone yeah i was on his wiki i mean there's no like date of death on so the poor guy still has  to fucking talk about that phone number oh well sorry yeah but he was tommy two-tone is the band name 
[00:36:30]  huh tommy two-tone is the band's name it's it's his name but it's his name yeah it's his name  hmm well we'll get to the bottom of that does he still gig he's one of those bands we talk about  this from time to time too the one hit wonder bands they'll play either a very long version of  their hit or they'll play the hit twice in one twice that's what aldo nova does they do fantasy  twice fantasy left is just a fantasy and again left is just i uh went to uh man am i gonna date myself

[00:37:30]  maybe he started his own rumor well i just started it yeah let's tweet it tommy two tone is dead  trending on google yeah might as well ladies and gentlemen tommy two tone we believe is dead dead  retweet that at the age of what let's uh let's call this 53 i could have sworn he was dead yeah  poor tommy two tone just wrote that poor bastard off didn't i all right we got reverend owl on uh joy

[00:40:30]  what's wrong with you songs and this is one of them okay well game seven tonight nba finals  basketball will finally be over anthony yeah who do you got who do you got lakers or the celtics  you know what i'm gonna have to go with the lakers on this one yeah yeah i'm gonna have to go with the 
[00:41:00]  lakers well you got the home court advantage home court advantage and uh you know me about boston  sports teams you don't like the boston sports not a big fan of them because of their intense hatred  of the yankees who by the way got their uh asses handed to him last night by a geriatric pitcher  oh wasn't it the oldest pitcher to ever beat the yankees yeah i think i saw that that motherfucker  couldn't throw a ball over 60 miles an hour get the fuck out of here and he fucking tore him up 
[00:41:30]  who was it jamie moyer yeah how old is jamie he's 47 47 47 years old and he's fucking pitching right  past all the fucking big hitters they they got uh they got fucked he's two years older than joe gerardi  i think he's manager uh oh oh oh duh okay yeah yeah the phillies dude he's having a really good year  at 47 years old you know what isn't that amazing 47 47 years old and you're still fucking playing 
[00:42:00]  professional any professional sport i have a tough time getting out of bed yeah like what the fuck  this guy's throwing uh fucking meatballs and he has no desire to quit well no no he's just gonna keep  going yeah jeter was saying something like that it's good probably do this another 10 years better  than half the other pitchers out there he's just throwing he goes he goes i don't think he threw  one ball over the plate it was just he was is he a joke pitcher he was putting the balls right where 
[00:42:30]  he wanted to right putting his balls right where he wanted to yeah he's like an old school pitcher he  doesn't just you know throw a hundred mile an hour fastball right right like he he pitches it's a it's a  mental game yeah yeah good he can't he can't wing that fucking ball well he knows that you know he  had to reinvent himself because yeah let's slow down though that old arm let's let's slow down  though he's seven and six era 4.76 yeah all right it's not like he's not lighting it up great he had  a good night yeah he's playing for a really good team too yeah yeah so a couple of those wins on 
[00:43:00]  another team probably wouldn't happen my dumb two cents hey uh travis while you're on mike  how much how much does tiger woods 11 suck a dick uh you know what i haven't i haven't really played  it in like a week well that says that says it all right yeah it's not grabbing me i've been in as far  as the tiger woods uh games go for all right if this is 11 i think i started uh four i think this is  about six or seven i'm in wow what the fuck is wrong with this this company i think it's just kind 
[00:43:30]  of getting to the point where it's like all right i did this last year they're greedy you know my  girl no change i'm playing yesterday she goes this is the new one i'm i go yeah she goes it looks  exactly like last year's game because she's you know she has to watch me play at 10 hours  10 hours at a click you know what else is odd about a golf game as opposed to other types of  video games that you can play they really can't change it up you they have all the courses 
[00:44:00]  you played all the courses like one or two courses a year yeah and and it's like all right  you add one or two courses it's like it's like putting out the same uh like modern warfare game  with only one new fucking one new map right or something or one new weapon or something it's like  the problem i have with tiger woods 11 is uh i'll make this quick no problem the gameplay you can't  really do much with even though they've made some adjustments there so i i i'm expecting because  i'm a fan of this is just more amazing graphics and they the in-game announcers are completely 
[00:44:30]  useless i think they've they used almost the same lines that they did last year i don't even think  they recorded new lines i really don't think so either wow and and and they sucked last year  i was so i just turned the sound down like it's a waste when you play madden you're like what the  fuck who's watching this game i'm playing yeah they know a little weird they know the action right  yeah like my chick was playing last night and she's done with her round and she's like you want 
[00:45:00]  to play i'm like nah nah i don't watch tv or something yeah and it makes me really mad because  i'll say it again hot shots was a great golf game but because tiger woods is so goddamn popular he was  able to take over the over that whole world and push everybody else out step aside and let these  other guys you know put a nice golf game out for everybody like hot shots had weird courses you  know what i mean you played in the rainforest or something it was just really weird shit that  made it a little more interesting you know if you want to do that then you can uh change it around 
[00:45:30]  and make a golf game a little different a little more uh exciting each time if it's just the same  courses the same fucking graphics the same thing they just change like they change some of the  interface a little bit it's like oh man the game is it worth it you know yeah yeah money you buy  your new clothes you buy new clothes and equipment right the problem with tiger woods golf the game  is like tiger himself absolutely no fucking personality no those little dumb little things 
[00:46:00]  that they have in video games that make you go oh wow that's kind of cool yeah they did that  none of that shit it's fucking bland as hell and there's little things that they change that i  hate like this is this is really like you know picking but the the sound that the club makes when  hits the ball this year it's like ding and it used to be like this powerful you know like go like  when you're really driving the ball yeah now it just sounds stupid and i'm uh i don't know what 
[00:46:30]  they were thinking obviously tiger had a hell of a fucking year so maybe he couldn't focus on his  own video game i bet you he doesn't even know this thing's out yeah that's what i'm starting to  think he's got a little more on his mind these days he probably got a phone call that you know he  was told oh by the way you know your new game's out there but i bet you really had anything yeah  how about my new my new love child is out there too and uh i can't golf for shit supposedly it's  all bullshit supposedly she's a pathological liar yeah the love child thing is that shit crazy bitch 
[00:47:00]  that that's got a dead end uh written all over us yeah that ain't going anywhere a little dna  gotta get maury in there tiger you are the father oh and he goes all crazy dancing around  the girl runs into the back freaking out maury has to calm tiger down it's okay tiger yeah you're  all right you're a good golfer don't worry about that would be great and then tiger fucking uh uh  takes a driver to a progeria kit and maury povich how great would that be tea up that little 
[00:47:30]  primordial dwarf i've had it with them and let's see if you can launch him over the audience right  uh philly's calling like crazy and and i i apologize i should have said this because  i actually was watching the game down in philly uh jamie moyer pitched a no hitter two weeks ago  hey congratulations oldest pitcher to do so i do believe what a guy at the age of 47 he didn't  pitch a no hitter two weeks ago was it a one hitter maybe roy halliday pitched a perfect game like 
[00:48:00]  wait a minute jamie ran away they certainly didn't pitch a no hit wait what was it then  oh man do i look like a complete fucking you know what it was the guy that called was a liar  or an ass was it just a complete game the oldest pitcher to what was it it might have been i'm not  sure but i know for a fact it wasn't no i am in that would have been a lot of that would have been  big news i'm embarrassed right now i'm i'm heating up i'm very uncomfortable i am uh i'm supposed to  know about every team no i should fucking know that what the fuck did i watch then somebody help me 
[00:48:30]  out hey uh travis who do you got in the u.s open starts today pebble beach i always root for phil  good old phil yeah i really like phil jeez i know a lot of people don't like him bandwagon jumper  no i've always liked phil phil mickelson yeah he's fun to watch us open obviously is one of the  bigger tournaments of the year and and uh this phil mickelson has been he he has finished in second  place in the u.s open i think five times yeah he's a five fucking times he tends to choke at 
[00:49:00]  second place by the way the jamie moyer thing it was a complete game it was okay oldest pitcher to pitch  uh complete game yes yeah you know why he did his job wow they acted like it was a no hitter when  it went down so it was a two hitter so that's pretty good all right that's not bad i'm sorry  sorry for my lack of knowledge on that one sorry i'm sorry portal portal coming out looks good danny  fucking showed me the uh trailer for that yeah portal is a really cool game does it look like  they've busied it up there's a lot going on in the trailer because the trailer looks kind of cool i 
[00:49:30]  like like there's one segment where the floor kind of opens up and and it's on little elevator  things and explain portal for the people shit going on how do you explain portal uh it's kind of  like a take a a video game and uh a puzzle game and add well not a puzzle game see i'm not doing this  right it's it's like a uh you you're you're a guy you're you're a girl you're a girl oh it's a  chicken this one no you've always been you've always been a chick i never knew it because i never 
[00:50:00]  pay attention to the fucking boobies you never shot two portals i've looked at myself and i  always thought it was just a nice slender looking uh twink uh you have a portal gun that you can  shoot and uh kind of jump through it and end up somewhere else yeah it's like you make wormholes  everywhere you make little wormholes so if you you're you're stuck you shoot through a wall and  then you go through the portal you just made and now uh uh later on in the game you can shoot  another portal and go in the first one and come out the second one so if you got to get up a level 
[00:50:30]  and you don't know how you would shoot right next to you into the wall and then shoot up top on on a  ledge and you walk through the portal and now you're up top gotcha if you had to do that and this is the  that's the gist of the game but um there's a whole bunch of like other shit involved that's just what  what the basic gist of it is now it was supposed to come out in uh uh around halloween but they  delayed it to now it's just 2011 which i'm not happy about 2011 so you know what anytime i have 
[00:51:00]  faith in valve they've they've done well before so you know what if it takes the extra time to get a  solid game done then fuck it out you guys beat the the portal yeah portal the original portal it's  not a huge game it's not a it was kind of was it like an extra yeah it was kind of an extra  for all the half-life games they put out all the half-life games at once uh on the orange box and  then added this portal game and people were just like holy fuck this is great i was hooked immediately  man yeah i mean i was watching i saw the original portal trailer probably a solid a solid year before 
[00:51:30]  orange box came out and i i couldn't wait for this fucking game this looks so cool and it makes you  really think like you have to you have to look at the situation you're in and really think about  what you have to do you have to and it's not just shoot shoot walk walk you got to time some of  this shit we have to jump off something as you jump you have to fire a portal so you you don't hit the  floor you you land through the portal and then nail another fucking place before you go through the 
[00:52:00]  portal so you pop out of that one as you're falling a lot of trial and error you know what and it's a  great game in the sense that there's more than one way to do things and i always i mean i've i've played  through portal at least you know maybe five times already and i love just sitting there and watching  a new person play yeah because i love to see what their thought process is and how they figure it out  like you could be there there's a one one thing where you're in front of this wall that is so high  up but it doesn't go to the ceiling there's a little spot on top and you're like how the hell am i 
[00:52:30]  going to get over this wall and you realize you got to go up onto a ledge that's way back behind the  wall so you can't just jump over it from the ledge now you got a fire a portal in the floor  and jump so now you're building up the speed from falling gotcha and then before you fall through the  portal you got to shoot another one in the wall so now when you fly out of that other portal you  have the speed you've built up from falling so now it shoots you out of the portal and you fly over 
[00:53:00]  the top of the wall speedy thing goes in speedy thing comes out that's what they tell you let me  ask part of the the rules of uh is the laws of gravity as far as this goes is this game more  complicated than paper toss a little bit a little bit i don't think the graphics are as good  but uh paper toss i'm obsessed with paper toss it's fucking it's you know what i'd rather play  paper toss than tiger woods 11 and that's not even a joke that's how disappointed i am in that 
[00:53:30]  stupid game i'm gonna pick up portal today because i need a game it was a great game i need a real  game to play not i'm done with these fucking golf games you know it's not one of these games where  you're gonna sit there and it's gonna take you a week to beat it or whatever i mean you i'm sure  you'll get stuck on a few parts remember i got stuck on a few parts the first time but it's not  really uh it's a game that you could play in an afternoon i've done that like just being bored and  not feeling like watching a movie i'll just throw portal on and run through it the first couple of  levels will take you a while because you just got to figure out what the fuck you're even doing  but then once you do it gets a little easier as you're going along you kind of go okay i remember 
[00:54:00]  doing that so oh cool and it's almost like they're running you through a training thing to try to teach  you uh what each thing does i know i fucking loved the game it was great i got money how do i get  portal right now game stop opens at eight o'clock we'll send one of them bitches send out one of your  fucking bitches i have a full report yes that's the kind of game that you're gonna get obsessed with  yeah you're gonna be a maniac with that game that's my problem that's why people will wonder 
[00:54:30]  why i don't play a lot of video games the problem is uh as you figured out over the years i got ocd  not as bad as my mom and my ocd comes out in video games like i was telling anthony if i got involved  with everquest i would have been one of those guys that would have been done yeah i would have been  done oh i was fucked for years with everquest because a stupid golf game i could play for 10 straight  hours a dumb golf game think about that where there's really not much going on after a while  yeah yeah after a while you're just kind of like doing the same fucking thing over and over again  same thing uh since we're talking a little bit about tech stuff here i also want to bring up the 
[00:55:00]  iphone thing the iphone thing 600 000 orders i know in the first day i know in the first day  it took the 3gs i think five days to reach a million so i have a feeling if they didn't sell out or if  apple and at&t sites weren't so get getting so hammered yeah i bet they would have got close  i i think they would i would love to know the amount of of potential customers who were who  got got frustrated or turned away because they couldn't get to the sites you saw a lot of people 
[00:55:30]  getting shut out because uh they couldn't get through and now they're saying if you order now  you're gonna have to wait until the beginning or mid-july to get it july 14th july 14th they're  saying now if you order from apple if you order from apple right now uh as opposed to any orders  yeah at&t's done taking orders it's it's just one of these things that uh you know what people  love them in my dumb little world i'm seeing a lot of my blackberry friends are they're going away  yeah and i'm trying to hang in there but i went to myself um phone store the other day in a panic 
[00:56:00]  i'm like when is the next phone coming out because this one i got the latest blackberry and it's starting  to feel dated already and then you got this iphone coming out so i go to the store i'm i'm in a panic  i'm like when's the next one coming out so i could hang with these iphone guys you know what i mean  as far as technology goes yeah they're like maybe uh in the fall i'm like i might even have to  fucking go iphone you might and i'm losing my blackberry buddies to iphone so all this bbm and 
[00:56:30]  shit that i do my list is getting shorter and shorter by the week you know what this that is it's a  classic battle of like mac and windows was um blackberries were adopted by business companies  used blackberries they hand them out to their employees i don't think a lot of people went out  and just bought blackberries right i think a lot of it was business related like like windows was the  do all end all be all of computers in the workplace sure that was it mac was done if you remember 
[00:57:00]  they were like fuck that uh now it's a little different but still windows is still the predominant  program being run in businesses blackberry the predominant communication device for businesses  but the iphone is for people that want cool fucking gadgetry and uh new shit a lot of apps  things that the other phones that and i know boy this gets an argument going because people cannot say  enough about the phones they love and every other phone sucks but meanwhile the the truth of the matter is 
[00:57:30]  you can look at the iphone and just say look this is what your phone is based on yeah so shut the  fuck up every time i think i'm sick of of hearing the arguments i just start shit again just so i  could see it oh i know i saw you have it all over again i'm like oh danny's in a phone war danny's in  a twitter phone war it's like the down hatch it's like the third one in a week but yeah because it'll  happen and then i'm like i i fight back and then i get all annoyed and i'm like why am i annoyed for 
[00:58:00]  this is so stupid and then i just start to shit all over just the fact that they have to say  things like you know we have a lot of apps too it's like apps yeah where did that come from by  the way oh the touch screen yeah who really fucking made the touch screen a really viable  thing instead of this inconvenient half-assed not working thing it's like i said all these phones  they're trying to be what the iphone originally was right and it's fun that they're playing catch  up and stuff but you know i think phone developers should probably start working on the next big 
[00:58:30]  thing yeah the next thing next big thing is the is the iphone perfect fuck no but you know what  i cannot find a better phone one that works better for me and they're only making it better with the  this iphone 4 that's coming out and i cannot wait to get it i am fucking pre-ordered and ready to rock  i'm pre-ordered javis is pre-ordered day one day one i think even uh even uh primetime sam roberts is  a blackberry defector back on the iphone train oh he's one of my blackberry uh but he's going away 
[00:59:00]  he's one of uh a few that hit me up uh recently saying i'm done the only thing pissing me off is  that um that uh flash program the adobe flash not being able to be used uh because boy that annoys the  piss out of me at times when you go to a website and it's like ah fuck you know what i'm starting to  notice a whole lot is uh websites that were traditionally flash yes are now starting to  implement the uh quick time yes and i it's not it's not being so much of an issue that it used to be 
[00:59:30]  yeah because i think i think people realize that the web is quickly becoming more of a mobile uh a  mobile place yeah instead of just sitting at your computer you're gonna have to get them on and  watch shit on the fly a lot of people have that shit going all right well we got to move on to the  reverend al thing reverend al yeah just because i'm fucking jealous with this iphone thing oh i  don't want to hear about it anymore getting that bad news from my cell phone guy also if anybody has  any info on on this because i have a little problem with um with my uh you stream show uh not a big 
[01:00:00]  problem it's a little problem uh for some reason when i watched the uh replay and i think even live  and and that's based on flash uh my my words weren't lining up with the video the words were just  slightly off from the video yet i watched it on my ipad which switches it to quick time  and it was fine everything was lined up perfectly on the ipad but then i watched it on my computer 
[01:00:30]  and it's a little and and the the mouth a little off from the fucking video enough to be annoying and  not look good right so i got to figure that out all right so if everybody uh anybody knows what the  fuck to do on that one uh get a hold of anthony let me know get let me know through twitter well  we're going back to the seattle uh cop confrontation big story i'm asking these assholes and you shithead  big story and reverend al's involved of course he is the opportunist himself uh jumped right on this 
[01:01:00]  one you got that cop out there in seattle he's in a situation and he decides to punch one of the  girls and take her out of the equation yes a lot of people outraged blah blah blah blah blah and of  course reverend al's pretty much making racial love can't wait to hear him say that the cop was  right and uh they were wrong uh he was on uh joy behar who's doing a great fucking job for  cnn headline news yeah she needs to get off that dumb view and just do this full time  get some respect back into her life some respect uh here's reverend al okay reverend al what was this 
[01:01:30]  an act of anger or self-defense in your opinion well i mean from the tape it appears to be a act of  anger uh the question be anger what a fucking asshole this anger would be what a fucking just if he  walked over to her and uh punched her in the face how about the fact that she was all over this guy 
[01:02:00]  getting between him and the person he's trying to arrest trying to break them up physically pushing  him and uh he's already got his hands full he's in a hostile situation with a bunch of other people  that he doesn't know what they're going to do next and he took care of her he fucking dispatched her  is he going to mention the anger of pinky we've been calling her pinky pinky the girl she seemed a bit  angry of course she was being held back yep and broke free of uh the guy whether it was her boyfriend 
[01:02:30]  or just a friend just so she could get right in that cop's face and fucking be a dumb bitch uh the  question becomes whether punching someone uh falls within the guidelines of the seattle police you know  we have a chapter of national action network there there was a incident that i'm sure steve knows about  with the latino uh... with the seattle police not long ago so i think that it is in the climate of  some problems uh... between the community and the seattle police that this is being viewed at 
[01:03:00]  i think though that one cannot justify people pushing a policeman the question is whether or not  the guidelines of the police can justify him then punching her we're not talking about pushing back  we're not talking about grabbing arm and arresting but physically punching her i think that's where the outrage  you know wow so far so good uh... so far staying a bit calm so he's trying it you know what a bit calm  let's see where it goes just goes to show you he's trying very hard because he's he's actually saying 
[01:03:30]  she shouldn't be pushing the the cop right uh but does that punch is that part of what the police  are supposed to do is what the the good reverend is uh saying and uh i think uh that that shows  restraint a fist to the face after he tried to get her away a little bit there sure  why was he arresting her for jaywalking though let me tell you i visited seattle  is steve wilco or wilco's and by the way i got stopped for jaywalking when i was the police 
[01:04:00]  they ordered me to stop they told me to come over to them so it's obviously uh... an issue in seattle  that they take maybe more seriously than other cities well boy i never but i don't know he was but  joy i don't know if he was arrested if he was arrested or punch i think that to look at that tape but  what it appears i do not think you can say that that officer i was sure i wasn't arrested or  punched but i comply let me finish matt i don't fly uh... what what what i don't think that you 
[01:04:30]  could say that officer had come back and punched her trying to arrest i think it appears that he's  reacting in anger and i again question whether that is is the guidelines that you can come back and  assault someone uh... for pushing you as a policeman and i think that that is the issue that they're going  to have to resolve in this that wasn't out of anger for pushing him see that's what the good reverend  does not understand if it was anger for pushing him it would have been a let's say he uh... gets 
[01:05:00]  a traffic stop he pulls a woman out of a car um ask the woman for a license she says no he demands  it and she pushes the officer right and he punches her in the face right that's a problem when you are  trying to get somebody subdued and cuffed and another person comes over and joins the fracas uh... you  have to protect yourself he was protecting himself fuck the fact that it's two girls you know this 
[01:05:30]  isn't some kind of fucking uh... uh... chivalry thing this isn't the you don't hit a girl thing this is a cop  being assaulted and uh... uh... being interfered with during an arrest in a hostile environment  yeah they were coming at him very aggressively and he's just trying to control the situation  he's protecting himself it looks a little rough to see a cop punch but you know he did what he had  to do well when you just play the one clip like the news has well true uh... you know of course it 
[01:06:00]  looks rough because all you see at that point is just a girl kind of like in his face a little bit but  you don't see that she broke free of her her guy there and the lead up to the whole thing yeah  looks like i mean it looks like the cops a bit inexperienced but you know but he still he still  got the job done in the end got the job done no one got hurt you know something if someone would  have gotten tased there would have been a problem if someone would have gotten shot if someone would  have gotten a fucking baton across the face this would have really this would be he used restraint 
[01:06:30]  by just punching her in the face that's restraint and it also shows his character because then he  struggles with the other one for what seemed like an eternity and he never used any you know violence  on her could have body slammed her to the ground he didn't yeah hip toss her or or punch her in the  face yeah he was trying to keep her up and just turn her around and pull her arms behind her that's  all he was trying to do he i've watched enough fucking police in action where they fucking can get 
[01:07:00]  you right around the neck and pull you right down to the ground right and he didn't do that in that  situation because i don't know if it was restraint or no or you would have known that that there would  have been a problem right somebody probably would have gotten a little more aggravated i think he  wanted to stay on his feet yes because there were other people around that he didn't know yep what they  were gonna gonna do it's simple as this once those girls pushed that policeman he was the one being  assaulted so he can effectively put them under arrest which if you listen to that tape he is ordering 
[01:07:30]  them saying you are under arrest put your hands behind your back stop resisting he's using every  verbal he's given them every verbal chance to stop resisting arrest so he wouldn't have to use the force  he then used to do a very good job of filibusing he said everything other than and therefore he according  the guidelines can punch her we're not questioning whether he should have the right to say stop put  your hands behind your back the question is the punch and is that within guidelines of the police 
[01:08:00]  department that's the issue yes it absolutely is it within the guidelines to punch someone in the  fucking face uh in order to uh do the situation out of the mix take them out of the dangerous mix  that you're in i'll keep saying it is i'll keep saying it doesn't look pretty but guess what yeah  the cop took care of the situation of course it is i was just a jerk what do you what do you think  it's like do you think it's it's that that every police officer has this power where they can just  verbalize something and people comply that if it does reverend now think that if the officer would 
[01:08:30]  have said the right thing that uh he wouldn't have had a puncher in the face uh or or the fact that  that situation was out of hand he had two females that were fucking ridiculously out of control  not complying whatsoever and he had to deal with the situation he had one of them in hand he could  not then turn his attention to pinky and and start discussing the finer uh points of not being uh uh 
[01:09:00]  ridiculous right so he punched her in the face yes and i would say absolutely that is part of police  policy that you can punch someone in the face to to take them out of a situation has the seattle  police department made a statement on i know the union made a statement and they said the punches and  said absolutely this guy did everything that he should have done and uh uh so they answered reverend's  question yes yeah so where's that police union did where's that seattle police department comes and 
[01:09:30]  has a statement uh i've yet to hear that one yeah okay it continues he might have stopped them for  jaywalking and it escalating into one interfering with the police and then assaulting a police officer  that's probably what they're charged with not with i'm sure the question is does he arrest him or does  he have the right to punch them joy the issue is two wrongs don't make one civil right again steve has  discussed everything but guidelines of policing he's not a civilian now that's angry he's a police 
[01:10:00]  officer no police officer you know joy oh my god he's filibustering i love how he says that you've  done a good job of filibustering but let me ask you was it justified the punch now all he's concentrating on  is the fact that a white officer's knuckles hit a black woman's face and once again if it's a black 
[01:10:30]  cop punching a black girl reverend now wouldn't be anywhere on tv he wouldn't be anywhere with this  thing he's absolutely not on tv so he's he's taking the whole thing out of context the uh steve wilkos  isn't filibustering there he's explaining the entire situation and reverend now is taking white fist into  black face and only concentrating on that this is going to hurt you we got a cop out of uh buffalo  scott and buffalo how are you sir hey what a long time first time how you guys doing whack whack how 
[01:11:00]  you doing man how's the eicher bar doing you know what physically never been there my whole  fucking life oh okay okay oh you're anyway that means you're a healthy guy i try uh there's a uh  use of force continuum yes they teach in the police academy so it's how you escalate force  according to the uh oh i guess the penal law and all that happy horse shit and nowhere in that use  of force continuum is there a punch to the face uh so what reverend now is saying is technically 
[01:11:30]  correct yeah but aren't they technically correct but aren't there um rules that are it doesn't  specifically state a punch to the face but it does say physical force to uh keep you out of to  protect yourself self self-defense during that but they legally do not allow you to punch to the  face and through the whole police academy through all the training that they do they will actually go  through the drills they'll go through the cuffing uh wrist locks uh you know techniques like that but 
[01:12:00]  they will literally never tell you and never endorse you punching someone in the face so you in that  situation how would you then dispatch that girl in the pink if she starts getting in between you and  the person you're trying to arrest actually physically punch people and told and i've been told go to  the spray go to the taser before going to uh going to a physical force situation where you're striking  someone with your hands and uh it's kind of a bullshit thing because i 100 agree with this guy i can 
[01:12:30]  understand that if he's dealing with one person uh but this guy was in a a hustle environment he's now  dealing with two people that are on him and uh he i don't think he had his hands free enough  to do anything but curl it up and throw a punch to get that one out of the way and you know what i  again i 100 agree with what his actions were i 100 have been in the situation he's been in  and said hey shit you know it's going down you gotta if you gotta take a cinder block and smash 
[01:13:00]  him over the head with it that's what you gotta do but the reality is that they don't they would  never endorse you doing that no i i don't think they would endorse it yeah we hear you yeah i don't  think you could have it in the books uh that says in this situation ball up fist and throw it into  her face and smash 17 year old girl in the face yeah smash 17 year old in the face if you want to get  your ass kicked jump into a girl fight especially a fight with black girls i mean that is you know do you 
[01:13:30]  you will literally get your ass yeah you'll get your ass handed to you i i don't i don't mess with  black girls ever no you're crazy too you'd be crazy too i i i learned well in high school when i used to  watch the black girls rip each other's hair out oh yeah pull out that motherfucking black girl  fight that weave out your head if you want to have fun fucking uh do a little search and go black girl  fights on the internet it's amazing i i don't want to get in the middle of that shit nothing better than  two big fat like big fat black women ripping the weaves out of each other's head and then there's 
[01:14:00]  one where where a bunch of the guys that are videotaping it pick up the girl's weave and start just  throwing it around at each other yeah it's like it's like fighting an octopus i think it's like how  do you handle an octopus it's the same thing as fighting a black girl yeah so sir i i i i think i  think as far as technically speaking when reverend al says is there is there a policy for punching  people i would say uh no there's probably not a policy on the seattle police department for  punching people in the face but i definitely think there's a use of um appropriate physical 
[01:14:30]  force for the situation and i think that was appropriate i i agree with the appropriateness  i mean he didn't shoot her no yeah yeah that would have been a problem yep yeah i mean she was  unarmed he didn't shoot or he needed to uh to control the situation uh what he did in my book  it was a no-brainer if it wasn't caught on video it was a non-issue yeah exactly well everyone has  their videos out oh they pull those phones out and think there's police brutality every 
[01:15:00]  fucking second that's right meanwhile pull the phone out when your fucking buddy is doing it that  i mean what does this have to do with black and white yeah exactly well that's the next clip  we're about to play so thank you scott for your insight thanks man i appreciate it all right all right  big hi to everybody in buffalo my old stomping oh buffalo one of my many old stomping grounds  i love you've stomped there well people think i'm i i uh was born in buffalo really i guess you did  a good job on the radio making it look like i was local oh really talking about the sports teams in 
[01:15:30]  the streets rochester same thing when i go up there people like welcome home i'm like well i'm from  long island i made it look good i made it sound like i i grew i was born and raised in rochester  it happened in boston too yeah yeah for a while people thought we were from boston long island man  uh al says there could be a racial element here we go yeah well al is there some racial element to  this what do you think about that too or steve i mean the coppers is white and the teenagers are black  i mean is there an in a racial element obviously that will be some be something that uh would be 
[01:16:00]  looked into people uh my radio shows on in seattle people called about that today i think what is  disturbing is immediately the union president said there was no race involved i don't know how  you do that investigation that quickly i don't think that just anyone on either side way around  ought to jump to a racial conclusion but i think you exacerbated when you say no race was involved  before there's even an investigation on inquiry into this officer or his background in terms of 
[01:16:30]  race yourself really like every crime that's a black on white crime that you never mention or get  involved in uh that race isn't involved because it's black on white crime instead of the other  way around what a fucking hypocrite this guy is fuck reverend allen is big fat ass and we've tried to  get reverend allen on our show many many times you won't come on here chicken shit motherfucker and  al gets the final word and after he hit her yeah all he did after that as you keep watching that tape 
[01:17:00]  all he did was restrain and give verbal orders he might have well which he could have done without  punching her okay but oh really so so i guess you're a cop you were a cop once right now you  do you understand what they're going through in that situation she put herself into that situation  he didn't drag her into that he didn't lean over and just out of nowhere start swinging wildly and hit  that girl in the face she fucking put herself in that situation he didn't immediately punch her  either she was trying to get in there he's trying to restrain the other girl and when uh pinky got in 
[01:17:30]  between the two of them got in between and started pushing them apart that's when he decided i gotta  get rid of this girl she's now in this situation and and interfering with an arrest and pop right in the  face one punch in the face and then that was it and like uh steve wilco said uh verbal commands and  trying to tie her arms up and and arrest that one girl think about it i mean if you're a cop and you 
[01:18:00]  punched uh you you punched this girl in the face once right yeah everyone is filming it everybody yeah  why not why not at that point go fucking wild oh just punch everyone just hit everyone just start  swinging and punching everyone why not you hit her in the ass neck he's already in trouble for the  one punch right yeah but like steve said in that clip yeah he showed restraint guys showed restraint i  mean vocal commands and uh and then he wrestled with the black girl what seemed like forever yeah 
[01:18:30]  because he was fighting because he was fighting an octopus and he was trying to be have some restraint  with her too he didn't belt her in the face you know why it was one-on-one and he knew eventually he'd he'd  get her you know she was starting to tire right if you watch that clip and uh it wasn't another  person coming into the situation he had an opportunity to give her roller coaster face  too but decide not coaster face greatest line ever patrice big mama prods oh still laughing at  roller coaster face uh a day later yeah why it why is there this coddling and this second guessing going 
[01:19:00]  on just because they're black now we're not exactly what revernell's doing we're looking at the video  again and we're not we're not gonna be able to get to all your phone calls but what the hell i'll uh  i'll promote my shit a little bit uh i i filmed us uh discussing this with patrice in studio and  club soda kenny who was on the job for many many years and anthony and uh and that video i made up on  my youtube channel op radio and join the conversation man the comments are pretty damn good a lot of people 
[01:19:30]  commenting on this whole seattle police officer thing uh please out we got brendan in new york brendan  hey guys what's going on hey brother hey man yeah i'm that cop i've been a new york state trooper  now for 10 years and that last call he had was absolutely full of shit um about the continuum of  force they train us in boxing i mean we box every day in the academy so they definitely train us to  punch in the face yeah sometimes uh you know yeah if you if you get into a physical altercation with 
[01:20:00]  somebody um you know you got you got to know how to fight what would have happened what would have  happened if he tased the girl is that then it would have been great taser video on uh is that worse than  the punch to the face yeah it all depends on what happens afterwards you know it's it did does she die  that's bad maybe or or when she's down on the ground does and she's disabled and tased does he then 
[01:20:30]  continue to use that kind of um force against her uh who knows maybe maybe the cop did her a favor by  not tasing her yeah exactly maybe i don't know he probably didn't have one i don't know because i'm  not a fucking they don't give them out to everybody right all right brendan thank you  yeah i just think you might have an old say my uh sergeant in defensive tactics used to say  if you touch a gray you're gonna pay they put your hands on you knock them on that touch a gray you're  gonna pay oh look out i like it i wouldn't who the fuck is like i it has never crossed my mind 
[01:21:00]  even as like a kid up until right this instant to put my hands on a fucking cop you not you're not  winning that battle all right you know what everyone's talking about the buffalo cop uh  being out of their mind uh out of his mind uh jennaro yeah jennaro medford what's up what's up  about that um this hi let me preface this by saying that you couldn't keep mclean as a last name 
[01:21:30]  every time i call with this joke sorry you know it's every time i can't stop you don't realize at  this point this whole show is three lousy jokes we just we just adjust it every day to make it  sound different hey at least you're not ellis when he calls yeah that's why i listen to it i'm  intelligent enough to understand it all speckens attack right on jennaro it's uh this guy from  buffalo and again let me say i i haven't seen this video yet i'm gonna watch it oh fuck man it's 
[01:22:00]  it's everywhere yeah you gotta watch it but the use of force continuum i get what he's saying yeah  they teach us that but like anthony was saying there there is no specific guideline for every  single situation because we would never ever ever ever ever stop uh learning in our academy  um when when you're putting someone under arrest and this is from where i got from my academy when  you put someone under arrest you are required to use as much force as necessary to get those cuffs  on if you've got someone interfering you don't have time to turn around and say look hold on one 
[01:22:30]  second i'll deal with you in a moment and then turn around try to get those cuffs on yeah yeah coming  across assaulting you you turn around you punch him in the face it's not deadly force no you're  using appropriate force to quell a potentially harmful situation to you or to them you know it's it's  like people people don't get that absolutely and he was talking about you know transitioning to your  pepper spray or to your baton or you know growing up i was taught to use my fists okay so when immediately 
[01:23:00]  you're always going to go back to what's natural now they have to look at how long this guy's been  on the job as well you know how many times he's actually transitioned to any one of his secondary  weapons but i mean that they're not taking that in account reverber now i he's just he's just a joke  he's a race baiter he's a complete uh hypocrite um and he's so anti-police and pro-black no matter what the  cause is no matter what the situation is he cannot see past the racial uh side of it i could see 
[01:23:30]  if like you know he punched her and you know punched her in the face followed through put one foot on  her and cheered then yeah then that might be something you might want to be concerned about  but he punched her in the face from what i understand and and he continued with the arrest  i'm gonna watch the clip because i gotta check out the clip and then you'll yeah be more informed  people are assholes it sounds like me when i what i just said no i've watched plenty of clips  where i see uh cops that are completely inappropriate with the use of force against uh a black man or or 
[01:24:00]  black woman usually not a black woman usually it's a black man um that's just on the ground three cops  run up to him and just start bludgeoning him uh and kicking him uh yeah that's unnecessary i've seen that  okay let's finish up here's uh reverend al his final word on this whole thing drain and give verbal  orders he might have well which he could have done without punching her okay but i mean we're not 
[01:24:30]  listening later but steve joy if he restrained her later charged her later then why was the punch  necessary i mean what would maybe he keep going around is the punch do you think maybe he felt  threatened by all those people around him and what could possibly happen no what i think is that that's  why there are guidelines for police before we give him a badge and a gun and then he needs to follow  the guidelines and whether the guidelines say if you feel threatened do what you want to do and then  go back to police procedure that's not how you thank you policing in this okay oh wow a badge and a gun 
[01:25:00]  he didn't use his gun by the way he got a badge and a fist when is the media going to stop giving him  attention and by the way the badge that he had how about uh those two dumb bitches respect that  fucking badge that he had and not uh uh cause shenanigans like they did they both have they  both have uh police records criminal records and uh one of the girls was uh charged in february of last  year uh for assaulting uh a sheriff he pushed a deputy so there's a history of this you know there's a 
[01:25:30]  history of of just blatant disrespect the one has a second degree robbery charge and the other one has a  third degree third degree theft she stole a minivan stole a minivan kent police and she pushed a  sheriff kent police said she used a screwdriver to break the ignition and start the vehicle all right  so you got one car thief yeah these are girls that are under 20 years old second degree robbery  and assault you know something fuck these assholes but it's the cop reverend al yeah the cop's the 
[01:26:00]  asshole yeah play the clip of him punching her in the face 20 times uh out of context i'm sick of the  fucking news i'm sick of reverend al well and i'm sick of any uh black pundit that comes out in favor  of these two fucking idiots well the news and and and and fucking uh treats the cop like the criminal  and i want to slow you down a little bit amp because uh i've been watching this clip over and  over again on a million channels i haven't seen one long form version of this clip no you just see the  punch you just see the punch that's that's horrible reporting the context of the horrible of the 
[01:26:30]  punch is the most important part of the of the clip you see how aggressive she she got yes you  see that she was being held back even it's called a c it's called a co oh boy you get that from a  website i look at a lot of different websites i just know that's not a it can't be good it's called  a co i really don't know what that means there's tnb no there's a lot of uh initials that are used no

[02:23:30]  too and finish dreams because then yeah usually with me it's a completely different fucking dream  i have locations oh like oh yeah yeah yeah where it's like certain places and it's i've never been  there don't know them but they're in my dreams like sets like oh here here's this house that the  creepy people always come in the back door and yeah but you know and i have a gun but the bullets don't  fit and are you dreaming that for the first time though but you think you keep going no no no i know  how do you know for sure because i remember the subsequent dreams vividly i remember okay all of 
[02:24:00]  them i i and then there's certain cars that i have parking garages that are the same one and my  car always gets stolen from it it's like just shit happens all the time and then there's certain like  uh highway interchanges that i'm driving on and i always miss a fucking exit and it's a pain he has  to get back to it i've had this is what happens to a lot of people get sober uh when they stop  drinking and using drugs oh i'll never know this one might as well sit this break out  is that you have unbelievably real dreams of drinking and i still get them every once in a 
[02:24:30]  while you have unbelievably real like i drank in my fucking dream then you wake up in the dream  wake up in the dream and wake up you keep waking up like oh my god  well if in london type dream exactly like oh i didn't do it i did oh my god i still have my sobriety  and then you're looking over and you get a joint and a beer in your hand and and you and you're  like fuck oh you can't stop that's it was a dream but then i yeah anxiety dreams i've i've talked about  this one that i have all the time and it's uh i don't know why but i'm involved in some kind of 
[02:25:00]  fucking crime uh that happened years ago and they're just starting to get the peripheral players of  this and i know i'm directly involved and all i'm thinking is i left so much shit around that they  are absolutely going to catch me and i'm going to fucking prison that's a popular one and and then i'm  like freaking out and then i wake up and go like oh i'm out of trouble oh that's great i'm out of  trouble i think that's a popular one though yeah i think so a lot of people have that you ever wake

[02:28:30]  it's like i was living with anthony's mother-in-law and this was and anthony wasn't and i wasn't you  stop adding more fucked up shit let me just get my shit together exactly the holy stories a million  times i'm sorry to hear this shit again all right listen you you kicked the dog and it died later how  many years later i had i moved ten we moved up there to do radio i lived with the mother-in-law  and uh her daughter because that was my wife at the time right for such a short period of time because  my wife was like i gotta get the fuck out of here i can't live with my mom right we moved out opie took 
[02:29:00]  a little longer to move out like a year and uh wound up living with the mother-in-law for like a year  it was a year look at me up because my chick at the time didn't want to move to boston so yeah  yeah did he she didn't want to move to boston so maybe one night is that the fact wine is that  the fat chick in the high heels no she wasn't fat no she was like 90 pounds hope he's got the  fucking muppet eyebrows no she wasn't like yeah and then uh so she had a good dog chester that was one  of the most annoying dogs ever used to come up during dinner and just be like and she'd be and she would 
[02:29:30]  spoil the dog rotten come here chester you want some of mommy's food chester come here god my  darling chester and feed it at the table and shit and and it would just come over and hit your leg  and want food so i'd be talking and and without even looking down i would flick its nose and we go  like this it would go dog was horrible and then i looked down i go chester what's the matter  he'd lie and she'd be like chester's very hungry and launch some of your food it's like no i just 
[02:30:00]  flick chester in the snout and then one day opens down there nick game you know those days where  it's perfectly set up and you have it you have it planned out in your head it's like the game's on  i got good food all i got to do is go upstairs and get what a beverage yeah it was uh the knicks  were about to play they're in the finals or i don't remember yeah i think it was the finals at this  point do they play the rockets one year was it the rock ah whatever and prime rib from across  the street that was real nice prime rib did our radio show aunt's home and his wife i'm like i'm 
[02:30:30]  watching my fucking nicks prime rib fucking dinner on the tv tray downstairs by myself mother-in-law  upstairs it's perfect perfect might even jerk off down there after the game you never know it's one  of our afghans that she gets some peanut butter for chester and i'm like ah you know what would  make this perfect i think i even went beer that night i'm gonna go get myself a  fucking beer from upstairs i needed a beverage and i'm up in the the refrigerator and then 
[02:31:00]  anthony's mother-in-law i hear her go chester what are you doing downstairs and we knew and knew that  this dog was all about fucking eating constantly oh man i went no fucking way ran down the stairs in  time to see the tv tray tipped over prime rib on the floor with the dog eating it yeah and that's all  i'm gonna admit to today you fucking booted that and then all i'm gonna admit to today he ran like  it was a kickoff the dog had to get wheels in its back for its legs for six months i'll tell you this 
[02:31:30]  much thud i was so depressed i grabbed what was left of the prime rib the game's starting so i can't  get another prime rib but this is the guy's honest truth i don't know if i ever added this tidbit to the  story went back upstairs and washed out the prime rib in the sink oh no worse then reheated it in the  microwave or something and you never get the you never get the taste back nope no and the mashed 
[02:32:00]  potatoes were done because it's a fucking disgusting rug so i think i just ate a prime rib and i think  i washed washed off the green beans too or something whatever perfect moment we should go find find  where that dog is dig it up and kick it again it's bright it's burnt up and chester she had  chests cremated so that when she passed on she could have the ashes put with her and and chester died  and then she replaced it with tiffy little tiffy who yes was allowed to sit on the table and eat dinner 
[02:32:30]  yeah yeah and that was a yip-yap dog that one was a little yippy fucking shih tzu really i also broke  all her knickknacks oh hummels yeah yeah pretty much things those are worth money no it wasn't even  on purpose stuff it was opie with fucking she had she had a phone cord that was one of those phone  cords that could go anywhere in the house but when you put it hung it back up it fucking the cord rolled 
[02:33:00]  up into an ancient mace that's a great description you could take the cord and and and throw it in  ostrich legs and it would trip it safe to say the cord safe to say the cord was 20 to 30 feet  20 easily 20 30 to 40 probably and i have a habit when i'm like on the phone like most people you  gotta walk around because you got a cord everyone else had a cordless phone right and this cord just  got in the way of things and it would just be like like a robber at a jewelry store just knocking 
[02:33:30]  knocking hummels over and things and just destroying anything i felt really bad and she was cool  about it i remember those fucking cords because i did i did a lot of damage one day they tried to  invent a fucking cord detang they tried there was no way they said fuck it and just said fuck those  phones once the cord kinked like a slinky like one kink in it and you try to fix it you know what i uh in 
[02:34:00]  the end man all that shit i did to her by accident she loved me she loved you because she cut anthony  out of our poster she had the uh i didn't i didn't get cut out of the fucking poster the opian anthony  demented world uh cd poster that we had she had it prominently displayed she was very proud in the  house it was framed and everything and um yeah there there's the same as the cover the poster  and uh oh my way to stop please let me look i need to fucking look at you what the

[03:06:30]  syncs up um you think the audio would be good um the the original one and then we got an update  first one right there's this guy he kind of looks like arty lang he's in north carolina and and he  swears he he's seen bigfoot and cnn is playing this like it's a real story without going holy  shit this guy's out of his fucking mind really yeah which frustrates me because although it's a fun  story to check out for the radio show it's like you're cnn why don't you fucking call this guy out on 
[03:07:00]  his horse shit but they don't so this is the original clip we'll have it in a sec and then we  have an update a good update by the way why is sam running in here oh what's up sam it's just the  911 call is that bad no i know i'm playing the original first oh right but the cnn clip is uh  they actually treated it they said there were they they added it to other crazy 911 calls  oh well but the 911 call by itself is funny tim calls 911 right that's just the 911 call yeah 
[03:07:30]  that's good okay what's that's the update though okay right to the original story yeah just making  sure because you were referencing the cnn clip from this morning oh yeah he's on cnn again this morning  okay okay uh commercial we got it oh the commercial this is a 30 second commercial wasn't this 15  seconds yesterday they always used to be they were like 10 seconds at first internet commercials now 
[03:08:00]  it's just uh they got to pay for it somehow don't they 10 seconds before a video starts  it's really uh it really has thrown a wrench in on the um pain in the ass wanting to put videos on  the radio video on the radio yeah but here it is i tried to call him tim peeler thought he was calling  coyotes instead of them him he got something that frightened even this self-proclaimed mountain man 
[03:08:30]  this thing was 10 foot tall he had beautiful hair it scared me sergeant markself is a cleveland county  deputy deputy didn't see the creature this time there was a 8 to 10 foot hairy man looking person but  remembers the stories of a sasquatch when he was a kid was uh killing some animals breaking in chicken  houses killing chickens it's the same mo that tim says he saw for himself the sasquatch going after his 
[03:09:00]  dogs i'll come out here cheer cheer and rough talk to him and run him off got him all 9-1-1 then the  creature came back and i said get away from here get get the face re-acting right now deputies filed a  suspicious person report and tim is still recalling the details he looked like he had six fingers on 
[03:09:30]  each hand but even though sworn to serve and protect this is just totally uh blowing my mind  that they've been brought back up are left manning up at least for the cameras doesn't bother me now i  don't think there's anything to it didn't bother me so that guy swears he's seeing bigfoot in north  carolina that guy and yeah rules and uh they reference a 9-1-1 call now i know what sam's talking  about we got the 9-1-1 call because in the piece they they say he he called 9-1-1 so we got 
[03:10:00]  that right cheer what is queseland county 9-1-1 hello can i help you yes this is tim favor uh-huh  uh-huh you probably have my address yes sir what's going on now this beast is playing 
[03:10:30]  my dog  i've got five dogs bear dogs and all dogs he's hammered  uh examine then a shot i cried and i i found a light on this thing  but i would not shoot it okay what did it look like it looked like it looked like a giant ace with the 
[03:11:00]  but i was afraid to kill it  And it made a whistling sound.  A whistling sound.  Now, CNN had heard this clip, but, you know, then they don't have a story.  It made a whistling sound. 
[03:11:30]  And I said, get.  I rough talked it.  I rough talked it.  Oh, my God.  You know how many times the N-word's just flown out of that guy's mouth?  Just flown out.  You see his technique of fending off Bigfoot with that stick, though, Bobby?  I said, get out of here.  You don't belong in our schools.  I made my stick into a gun.  Now you got to go.  Yeah.  He was play acting with his little stick.  Get your own drink and fanting. 
[03:12:00]  Jesus Christ, man.  I'm going to hit the bell.  Oh, God.  Well, that guy is the.  We got more to the call, too.  That guy is the equivalent of anything I bring up as far as black people doing stuff.  That guy is the equivalent of making Whitey look just like idiots.  Yeah.  I could talk to that fucking guy for 10 fucking days.  I'd love to sit down and just listen to his stories.  Bobby, you know, sometimes I'm lonely. 
[03:12:30]  Sometimes the revenuers show up and I got to shut the steel down.  The whistles, too.  Fucking Bigfoot plays the flute.  Bigfoot whistles and has beautiful hair.  What if Bigfoot really did play the flute?  Like, he was just out in the woods.  That's what he did.  Bigfoot whistles, the Star Trek song. 
[03:13:00]  That's his favorite song.  That's his favorite song.  How the fuck do you know the whole song, you fucking nerd?  I'm glad you said it.  It really is a nerd.  He doesn't want people to know.  Dude, he really is a nerd.  There should be a point where you forget that. 
[03:13:30]  Exactly.  You know the whole thing on the fucking...  That's the bar music!  Oh my god.  Dude.  You shouldn't be on a cool radio show.  You should be fucking writing for Gizmodo.  Faggot.  What the fuck do you know?  I like to toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo. 
[03:14:00]  I would know the first four notes of the Star Wars song.  Dude.  Maybe.  I know some classics, too.  Yeah.  Oh, covered with cheese.  No, it's from Chariots of Fire.  Oh.  Right?  I don't know.  I am here.  Is that the theme?  What is it?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Chariots of Fire.  Is that the fucking gay movie?  It's Jethro Tell.  Can you do Beverly Hills Cop?  Wait, what was the last one?  Oh, Jethro Tell, right?  Yeah.  And you can hire Anthony from parties, bar mitzvahs, weddings. 
[03:15:00]  What was that other one?  Jethro Tell?  Yeah.  What was it?  Bungle?  Bungle?  Bungle?  Yeah, yeah.  Locomotor, bro.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you do?  You practice on your cock when you're home and you don't have that?  Yes.  I fucking squeeze my balls and roll into it.  You put a straw in your dick, all.  That's my toodly-doo flutas.  We got more of the 911 call from this Tim guy with the Bigfoot. 
[03:15:30]  Billy in Jersey, by the way, writes, Bigfoot enticed me my entire life.  He enticed me.  What is that?  Oh, fuck.  That was another drunk 911 call with some guy that shot his wife.  Fuck it, E-Rod.  Go get that for us.  And he just tells the 911 operator that she enticed me.  And you could just tell he was so annoyed he needed to shoot her.  Fuck it.  Travis has got it right away.  He needed to shoot her.  You want the long one or just that?  How long you got?  Well, the entire call is two minutes.  Fuck it.  What else are we doing today? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  This is what we're referencing.  North Richland Hills, 911.  That's it.  Hello?  This is Freddie Wilhite.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach with 38.  What address are you at?  84-32.  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's lying on the floor.  And what is your name?  Freddie Wilhite.  I killed Donald Hargreaves.  What?  Where's the gun?  It's in the closet. 
[03:16:30]  What is her name?  Donna.  Is there anybody else there with you?  No.  Okay.  Why did you do this?  She enticed me.  And she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  Okay, and you're at 84-32? 
[03:17:00]  That's it, baby.  Baby.  Okay, I'm going to get somebody out there.  Where out in the house are you right now?  Well, I'm in the dining room.  I don't know if she's dead or not.  How long ago did this happen?  A few minutes.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll see if she's alive. 
[03:17:30]  Sir?  You're alive?  You're dead.  You're what?  He said he shot a wife in a stomach.  You there?  Are you there?  Sir, I'm here.  I think she's dead.  Okay.  Is there anybody else in the house with you?  No.  A total of four units up there and reduce the rest of the other than that.  I'm peaceable.  It's okay.  Okay, sir.  It's okay. 
[03:18:00]  I understand.  I've got help coming up there.  I just want to stay on the line with you until they get there.  Okay, okay.  And then I'll go down.  I'm sorry?  I'll go down.  Okay.  Okay.  You all right?  How great is that?  I'm peaceable.  Did I hear him call her a stupid cunt?  Whisper stupid cunt?  Did you hear that?  Really?  I didn't hear that.  You didn't hear stupid.  She's a stupid cunt.  I don't know.  You didn't hear that?  You sure that's just not in your head all the time? 
[03:18:30]  The best part is checking if she's alive or dead.  You're alive?  Or dead?  Or dead.  Well, I like how he was practicing good gun safety because he says they ask where the  gun is and he says in the closet.  So he shot his wife and put his gun away.  I put my gun away.  I'm not stupid.  She enticed me.  The way he said it, he goes, she enticed me.  That was years of just her ragging his ass.  He didn't start.  He said, my whole life.  My whole life.  Oh, my God. 
[03:19:00]  He was just waiting, man.  He was just waiting.  Those fucking rednecks are fascinating people, man.  He probably finally took his trip to the Grand Canyon and said, okay, now it's time.  It's time.  Oh, my God.  Hey, let's get back to the Bigfoot guy who supposedly is on the line.  If that's him, can we make sure he doesn't go anywhere?  Oh, I'm sure it's him.  We'll see.  Yes, it's him.  We'll see.  But we got Tim talking to 911 about Bigfoot in his yard.  It continues.  But I just wanted y'all to know, I have not shot one or killed one. 
[03:19:30]  Okay.  Was there more than one or just the one?  Just the one.  Okay.  He was about nine, ten foot tall.  With real long arms.  And I've had experiences with him before. 
[03:20:00]  And they're deer staying.  But this one, somehow, I go out there.  He gets gone.  Now, I come back in the house, and he gets back there again.  And my dogs are just raising heck.  Didn't want to say hell, I guess. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's a God-fearing man.  He said he had come across him before in a deer stand.  It's like when he's hunting.  Bigfoot will come up and kind of say hi to him.  Wow, that guy is one of those backwards motherfuckers.  I could fucking hang with him for weeks.  Oh, would you love to hear us?  He might get that opportunity, because he might be on the line.  But first, the 911 call continues.  So I go back out there with my gun and my spotlight. 
[03:21:00]  And he goes right into the woods.  And then, I'll bring my gun and my spotlight in.  And by 10 more minutes, he does the same thing again.  So he came through more than one?  No, it's one.  But he said he did the same thing again.  Oh, no, he thinks it's more than one.  Would I get in any trouble if I shot and killed this beast, this animal, or whatever it is? 
[03:21:30]  Would I get in any trouble?  I can't answer that question.  Yeah.  Well, that's the way I am.  That's the way I am.  God damn me. 
[03:22:00]  We've all talked to this guy in our lives.  We've all talked to this guy.  Jesus Christ.  What you want to do is go down two blocks.  I'll take you if you want to go.  The best part of this is the fact that he sees the Bigfoot.  Apparently, the Bigfoot's not fucking with him, right?  Yeah.  But his big question is, can I shoot it?  It's really a great question.  Can I?  You should be able to answer that question.  If it's Bigfoot, yes, of course you can shoot it.  Yeah, but if you shoot Bigfoot, that's an endangered species. 
[03:22:30]  If you kill the only fucking Bigfoot around, you drag its fat head into your house.  He's the guy.  Yeah.  Like in the bar for the next years, he'd be like, hey, that's the asshole that shot fucking Bigfoot.  The last one.  And he'd be in the corner trying to tell somebody, hey, we're 10 foot tall if he was an inch.  If I could have it do all was over again, I wouldn't even looks at that Bigfoot. 
[03:23:00]  So I pointed my raffle at him because he enticed me.  But it turns out to be a stick.  So he came at me.  What an asshole this guy is.  He's the best accent ever, dude.  Oh, he is just a hillbilly.  The call continues.  This thing, some reason, tonight is coming down, messing with my dogs, trying to get towards 
[03:23:30]  my back porch.  But if he goes too close to me, I'm going to kill him.  Okay.  I can't answer if you can do that or not.  I don't mind him.  I don't mind him on the mountain.  I know what's on the mountain.  I don't mind him on the mountain.  But he's coming down here messing with me and my dogs. 
[03:24:00]  And my dogs.  My dogs.  You know, this guy's just naked.  He's got fucking cheese doodle crumbs on his fat stomach.  Fucking half of Elio's pizza.  It's a moonshine.  Now, I'm going to kill him if it comes down.  I don't mind him staying up on the mountain.  The mountain being the projects.  Yeah, the projects.  Exactly. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, they stay in their place.  I'll stay in mine.  But I'll kill him.  Well, believe it or not, the call continues.  Wow.  This is the last clip, though, finally.  I don't really, truly want to kill this creature.  Because they don't usually mean any harm. 
[03:25:00]  They never use any harm.  But I thought I'd call you and tell you.  In case I have to make that shot,  I'll call and ask you back.  I want you to do.  All right.  All right.  Well, I'll let's talk for now.  Okay.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Okay. 
[03:25:30]  All right.  This guy made a drunken Bigfoot call to 911.  Realized, like, in a moment of clarity  as he started sobering up what he did  and then had to go on the news  and come up with a Bigfoot story  when he wasn't drunk.  Like, yeah, he was over there  and I poked him with a stick  and he was 10-foot tall, beautiful hair.  What else did I say when I was fucking soft?  Whistling?  Yeah, he had a flute.  He was playing a goddamn Star Wars cantina song.  There's squirrels following him  because he's playing the flute.  Birds were on his chest. 
[03:26:00]  Dude, fucking A.  That guy's great.  Well, we might have him on the line.  What if he's not lying?  What if it really was Bigfoot?  Tim.  Tim, North Carolina.  Hey.  Hi, Tim.  I didn't want to shoot him.  Shit.  Fuck.  Y'all talking like that I wanted to kill.  I couldn't kill it. 
[03:26:30]  Something so beautiful as what I saw that night.  He's right there.  Keeling.  He's right there.  Just short of pulling it off.  God damn it.  We've been at this way too long.  Yeah.  He had the background, like the babbling brook.  A morning zoo would have went with it, bro.  Yeah, yeah.  Morning zoo.  Well, we actually have him on the phone.  Holy shit, we got him.  We got the Bigfoot.  We got him.  He's on the phone.  Whoa.  Can we just pretend we're a morning zoo for a minute  and let him go?  Yeah, it's exhausting.  Try it.  Hey, what's going on? 
[03:27:00]  Hello?  Yeah.  So now when you were face-to-face with the Bigfoot,  what was going through your mind?  Oh, good gosh.  Yeah.  It's too much work.  It's fucking exhausting.  It's too much work.  Right?  It really does hurt.  Rather listen to the voozles.  I would fucking shoot Bigfoot in a second. 
[03:27:30]  Who wouldn't?  And then I'd gut him.  Bag a Bigfoot?  And I'd wear his fucking skin on Halloween.  This is original fucking Bigfoot skin.  Dude, you got your coffee.  Dude, you got your fucking Bigfoot skin, dude.  You got your Bigfoot fighting stick.  What about the douchebags that actually got a fake Bigfoot costume  and then put a pig, a dead pig torso in a bucket, froze it, 
[03:28:00]  and said they caught Bigfoot?  Really?  You remember that?  Yeah.  The news bought it for a second.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was real flesh and shit, but they took it out and did DNA.  It was actually a pig with a fake fucking...  That's not a Bigfoot.  Dude, my fucking heart drop when they showed the photo  and they showed, like, a mush face and real meat, like, real intestines.  You're like, these cocksuckers got them.  Don't you think we would have come up with Bigfoot by now?  Like, someone would have fucking seen a motherfucking Bigfoot. 
[03:28:30]  Hunters go deep in those woods, man.  They would have found one dead.  They gotta die.  Bigfoot somewhere.  So where the fuck are the carcasses?  I don't know, man.  Maybe they're roadkill Bigfoot.  Yeah, that's it right there, yeah.  I don't know.  Anything.  Fucking, yeah, naturally dead Bigfoot.  I mean, look.  What, do they bury their dead and then where do they put them?  Do you ever see the fucking...  I mean, look at an alligator.  Look at those fucking Nile alligators.  That's a fucking dinosaur.  Yeah, we find that.  That's crazy shit.  Yeah, but we see those.  You don't think there's a fucking Bigfoot hiding in a cave with a flute? 
[03:29:00]  No.  Bigfoot.  I would love to think, but...  Nah.  What about the fucking Nessie?  You believe in Nessie?  No.  Nah, of course not.  You know what they have?  Marshall Tucker?  No.  Nah.  That's hard, because that's a real flute. 
[03:29:30]  I need like a pan flute thing.  We can get you one.  You can do anything a centaur can play, you can play.  Exactly.  A centaur.  You'd make a great centaur, too, by the way.  Oh, wouldn't I?  Yeah, you'd be a fucking hoofing centaur.  I love being a centaur.  Not a minotaur.  No, no.  A centaur.  A centaur, yes.  That's the famous Loch Ness monster picture, which turned out to be false.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it sucks that the only thing that in the ocean are fucking stupid jellyfish that light 
[03:30:00]  up.  That's the coolest thing.  Yeah.  You want like big monsters there.  Did you see the fucking show that they're catching great white sharks?  Oh, where they have them?  On, like, in that they have a-  That platform.  They catch them on a hook, like fishing, then they tire them out for hours, drag them over  to the side of the boat, and then the platform rises up, so they're just a fucking great  white is flopping around on just dry dock, and they stick a hose in its mouth. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  They get like an hour, and they stick a hose in its mouth, so the water's going through  the gills.  This motherfucker is-  Huge.  Huge.  Is there a video of this?  Yeah.  It's a new show on Discovery or something.  It's fucking-  They got video-  Yeah, it's called Holy Shit, We Got a Shark.  But you see that someone's going to get hurt.  Yeah, yeah.  The camera guy's always getting a little braver now, and he's in the pen while the shark's  coming in, getting the shark, and you see this fucking great white coming in, and they're 
[03:31:00]  yelling at him, dude, get back!  He's like, I'm fine, I'm fine.  Someone's going to get a fucking leg.  Well, that new clip of that guy getting bit with the shark is fantastic.  What is that?  Yeah.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  With a shark biting down on his hand.  Oh my God.  Do they release the shark when they're done? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They tag.  They have an hour to tag him, take blood, do all this crazy shit to the shark, but it's  fucking psychotic the way they catch it, and they raise this platform, and this thing  is just out of the water.  I don't know.  It's never been done before.  It's called Expedition Great White.  Right.  Who the fuck was that?  That's Travis.  Travis.  All right.  Listen.  Uh...  Do you befront me, boy?  Voices in my head?  I'll fight you with a stick.  If I could find where the voices was coming from, is it okay if I kill them? 
[03:32:00]  I heard someone say it's called Expedition Great White.  Can I shoot them while I get in trouble?  He enticed me.  Travis enticed me.  With his thin white wool jacket.  It came down over his knees.  The guy's setting up to kill his neighbor.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's setting up to kill his neighbor.  He hates his neighbor.  And he thought it was big. 
[03:32:30]  He hates his fucking neighbor.  Now he's got a backstory that he thought it was Bigfoot.  He's got 911 calls.  He's got a CNN piece.  Yeah, he's off the hook.  He's ready to kill his fucking neighbor.  He's had it.  That's what that's about.  It'll be funny if they just cut to the neighbor cutting his lawn and it's a black dude  Bigfoot was playing his goddamn rap music.  Lives next to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  People go over by Bigfoot and buy drugs from him.  And I just want to know if it's okay to kill Bigfoot. 
[03:33:00]  He wears Ed Hardy t-shirts and Chanel sunglasses.  And when the Bigfoot comes near my house, the property value goes way down.  The house next door to me was sold to Bigfoot.  That was the flute.  Wow.  I got to watch this fucking show, man.  This show is crazy.  Wait till the...  Oh, man. 
[03:33:30]  Oh!  Sharks are the scariest thing ever.  It's up on its side.  Look at that fucking shit.  Mother Karen's radio.  That is the scariest thing on the face of the earth.  Holy shit.  Look at that.  A great white shark.  Dude, here we go.  Watch it go up.  How big is that fucking thing?  And now what are they doing?  That's not even the biggest one, though.  They got the fucking huge one.  A guy is putting a big fucking hose.  And who figured out you put a hose in his mouth, it's going to survive all right?  Fuck.  Marine biologists, I guess.  No, that's how they breathe underwater.  The water goes through there. 
[03:34:00]  No, I understand all that, but...  That's how they breathe underwater.  That's how they do the things.  Oh, I didn't know that.  But I thought sharks had to keep moving all the time.  They do, but that's what the water is moving over is his lungs over here, so...  Dude, that's like a small one, though.  Yeah, sharks don't have that ability to suck water in and blast it through their gills like  fish do.  They go...  Like some fish.  So they have to actually keep moving.  Okay, listen.  Wow, that is a big fucking nasty scary shark. 
[03:34:30]  And they're right there.  Guys, we've got to learn about Nobby, though.  Bo in North Carolina.  Bo lives near the Bigfoot guy.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Same area.  Drilling holes in a shark.  It's cartilage.  With a fucking Makita drill.  What part of the shark?  They can't feel that.  It's the fin.  It's the fin.  It's like cartilage.  How do we know for sure, though?  I'm trying to put it like a bitch.  You don't feel it.  It's like, yeah, maybe you won't feel...  Maybe you won't feel this when I bite your fucking leg off.  Yeah, they probably say the same thing.  Don't worry, he doesn't feel it. 
[03:35:00]  He has no vocal cords.  So the shark is like, ah, ah!  And the shark turns to the other one and goes, he doesn't feel it.  It's like that fucking...  They have no brain power for this.  It's like that Metallica video.  Oh, God.  He's just fucking laying there.  I'm here.  Yeah, that could fucking kill.  Bo, what do you got, buddy?  Up in Kayser area, just over from...  I live in Pocopo, which is like seven or eight miles from Kayser.  Over towards the west of us, there's a little area called Sunshine and Gold Valley. 
[03:35:30]  And they used to have a smaller creature, about five foot tall, they used to call Nobby.  And people going up through there would see it running across the road.  It's just moving from one side of the road to the other.  But I've never seen it.  And I've lived around there my whole life.  Well, there's no Nobby.  There's no Bigfoot.  There's none of that shit.  I don't believe there is either.  But them people up there, they will start stories like that to keep the teenage kids out of the woods  to leave their damn stills alone.  Right.  Ah, to leave their stills alone. 
[03:36:00]  I got you.  So they make up these stories so the kids don't go in there.  That's genius.  That's the start of a horror movie.  That's genius.  Then there really is a Nobby.  That's a good one.  Isn't that M. Night movie?  M. Night Shyamalan.  Which one?  The shitty one.  Exactly.  Which one?  The one where people live in the woods.  They tell them that there's monsters in the village.  Oh, the village.  The village.  That's right.  Yeah, isn't that what they did in that thing?  They figured out?  The village.  Oh, that's right.  It's the exact same thing.  Yeah.  Those weird red creatures, right? 
[03:36:30]  Weren't they red or something?  Yeah, with the coats and the fucking skulls and the bones.  With the claws.  All right, thank you.  Thanks for telling us about Nobby.  Hey, uh.  Come on, they're fucking burning the shark.  That doesn't hurt.  That's gotta hurt.  Call some pipe hit.  Yeah, yeah.  With a blowtorch.  They're using a pair of pliers and a blowtorch on the shark.  Literally.  Why do they gotta do this?  I think they're tightening the bolts on the tracking device.  On the fin.  Every time that breaches the water, they can tell where the shark was. 
[03:37:00]  So then, in like a month's time, they can see little dots.  And why do they need to know this?  The shark's been around for, what, millions of years?  And we know where it's going to them.  He must be so mad when he sticks his fin out of his water to look cool.  He's got like a transistor radio on it.  Well, this looks awful.  It doesn't look scary.  Well, they got, they have, uh, in Boston, Massachusetts now, there's like fucking great white sharks everywhere.  They just saw like two of them last week.  There was five of them last year.  And they track them so they know where they are.  And they're right off the coast of like Cape Cod, Hyannis Point. 
[03:37:30]  There's fucking great whites.  They've always been right off the coast.  No, they haven't.  Chief Brody, you will not close those beaches in Bofferson.  I'm the mayor.  You'll not close the beaches.  What?  What, mayor?  Close the beaches?  No, it's the 4th of July.  What a fucking clusterfuck that would be.  He called the fucking, the, uh, the guy, the head, uh, the NBA guy, uh, Damon Sturm. 
[03:38:00]  Some shit.  Oh, yeah, he got his name all wrong.  I forgot already.  Oh, Dan, uh, this, uh, David Sturm.  It's not the time nor place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.  And I won't stand by while you cut that thing open and watch that little Kempsturner boy  spill out all over the dock.  Look at these motherfuckers.  Fuck you.  Yeah, that's some crazy ass shit.  Oh, fuck.  Now that they let him go, and they're just fucking with it in the water, 
[03:38:30]  this thing would bite you in half without an, at all an effort.  I could do some of that stuff.  You could do that?  Yeah, I couldn't jump off the stratosphere, but I could do some of that stuff.  I could probably.  Like they're doing, I'm saying, you know.  Dude, wait till you see the big motherfucker they pull up on the deck.  It was a big motherfucker.  No, that's a small one.  They get one on its belly, and it starts, they throw a towel over its head like it's  a fucking alligator.  These cunts don't know.  They put a towel over its eyes.  If you can't see, it won't bite you, really?  This thing starts thrashing, and there's a dummy gets stuck. 
[03:39:00]  There's always a dummy that's not thinking.  Yeah.  And he was stuck between the fucking banister and the shark's face.  Oh, Jesus.  And they're going, get out of there.  They had to do that yell where it's calm enough, because he was in fucking frozen.  Well, you know, you can't just yell, like, ah!  They had to not panic him, go, hey, get out of there.  Wow.  And he stepped over the shark's big head.  You see him snap out of it, like, ah, and then he steps over it. 
[03:39:30]  It's fucking crazy.  I would do that, too, Hope, I think.  I could do that.  Yeah, I could do that.  You know who's in it, the famous actor from the kid from, the good-looking kid from Fast  and the Furious, the play that plays the cop, he's on the show.  Oh, okay.  He's one of the guys.  Very good.  So I can actually hook you up with that if you want to do that, Hope.  Ah, no, that's all right.  Rapping, awful rapping weatherman, Dan.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This has been sitting around for a while.  Yeah, it's just something I saw earlier in the week, and I know how we all love the weathermen 
[03:40:00]  with a gimmick.  Yeah.  Wacky weathermen are the best, aren't they?  Just another example.  Let's take a listen to this.  A shout-out to Southeast Texas weatherman Nick Cossier and his super-dope forecast.  It is 8.04, everybody.  Oh, yes, the rapping weatherman is back doing what I does best, because I'm a weatherman.  I got my weather map, so if you have a weather question, go ahead and ask.  What's today's forecast?  Will it be nice? 
[03:40:30]  Um, yeah, Mike, it'll be all right.  The rhyming genius has been making the morning broadcast better since last summer, and says  he raps on a quarterly basis, or whenever he gets inspired.  Well, here's hoping the lyrical wizard does it more often.  It'll be partly cloudy, but one thing is clear, Fox 4 Good Day kicks derriere.  One is for the money, two is for the show, three is for the frizz factor today.  It's terrible.  And four is for Fox, five is for watch. 
[03:41:00]  Our show five days a week from six through eight o'clock, because nine is the time that  Good Day ends, and the last number's for Diane, because she is a ten.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Exactly.  They haven't rapped that way in 20...  That isn't even old school anymore.  ...five years.  Easy.  And just freestyling?  That's not even...  That's horrible.  That's like one hair above, well, my name is, and I'm here to say.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:41:30]  My name is Bobby Kelly, and I'm on the mic, I'm hanging out with my friends, they don't  like dykes, he had a dream of a fat chick in heels, and all of a sudden, he starts to  appeal to the chicks on the radio that don't like to be hoes, and then he took his cock  and stuck it in snow, and I'm going to Poughkeepsie this weekend, and I'm not going to bring my  dearest friend, Opie Hughes, Greg, you may say, but that's what you want to do back in  the day, because now we're matching the hatch, we're kitching the kitch, and all of a sudden, 
[03:42:00]  we're fucking the bitch in the hotel room, nigga, what's up?  It makes me yearn for Crazed from Ron and Fezz's show.  Fucking Crazed.  Holy mother of God.  We did a lot of material on the show today, I want to continue with this.  Those are some fat rhymes, yo.  What did we do on the show today?  James Cagney, Grapefruit, Bigfoot guy.  Fucking great.  What else are we talking about? 
[03:42:30]  Stratosphere.  The Dreams.  Well, you did the Dream one.  I'm trying to do something different.  Anthony and his fucking flute.  Oh, I did a little musical number.  Chester the dog.  Chester the dog with the dead dog.  What else?  What else?  That's some good material.  Oh, my God.  You ready?  Yeah.  All right, go.  Ready?  I need a beat, though.  You have a beat?  I'll give my own beat.  Ready?  I'm not a beatbox.  I'm hanging on the show with my friend and Greg. 
[03:43:00]  We all of a sudden start to eat eggs.  We put them down and talk into the mic because, you know, we don't like to fuck the dykes.  We like pussy and it's got to be juicy.  We're going over to the place.  Don't laugh at me, Anthony, while I'm on the mic.  You might not know how to fuck a dyke.  I'll say it twice.  You don't give a shit.  Fuck you.  You know, and that dog you had is a fucking mutt. 
[03:43:30]  And I would have kicked it in the fucking gut.  Hope he had the right moves because his steak was on the floor and his potatoes weren't there no more.  So he killed that motherfucker, rough, rough, rough.  But you know what?  It wasn't that guff.  You look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what I mean.  Because I don't have time to show you the team of the A, the Rampage Jackson.  You know I'm a fraction of what I should have been a long time ago.  But I'll keep rapping.  You don't hate this.  You don't even know.  I'll throw it in right in the middle. 
[03:44:00]  I'm so fucking wow.  I eat Skittles.  I'll spiff it up.  I'll make it jacked.  And then I'll look back on the guy with the heart attack that saw Sasquatch in the woods.  And you know all of a sudden he has the word coulds in his fucking mouth.  Because he had a gun made of a stick.  All of a sudden you had to pick.  Did you know him?  Did you know her?  Or did you like it?  But you don't know because you drink water.  Yeah.  I'm not done.  Fuck that. 
[03:44:30]  We're going to go back.  But that's supposed to be some kind of sick joke.  And I'll throw the joke in.  But you know I'm no yoke.  Like the inside of an egg or the outside.  Which is it?  But you know.  What have we got here?  Fucking comedian.  I do.  I tell jokes on the weekends.  At Bananas.  Poughkeepsie.  I don't have shit that rhymes with Poughkeepsie.  Except come see me.  Oh.  I mean you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  White girls like me.  Black girls like me.  Girls adore me.  Even the ones that even saw me know.  I even rhyme with a fucking show. 
[03:45:00]  Why?  I don't know.  I'll steal a fucking rap from a hoe.  I don't give a shit.  I'll move on.  Push another button.  I'll flow with it.  You don't even got no fucking show without it.  Yo.  I'm Bob Kelly.  I'm a rapping genius.  Hey.  Where are the white women at?  They're around the corner.  After the show.  We're going to go see them.  Whoa.  Da ha.  Da ha.  Da ha.  Da ha.  Da ha.  Da ha.  Da ha.  Da ha.  Yeah.  Da ha.  Ha ha.  Skup.  Bump.  Da.  Boop.  Ba. 
[03:45:30]  I make it into jazz.  As simple as that.  Opie has a smile that makes you go wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go he.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go do.  I just mix shit up.  Do what, Bobby?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck just popped out there?  Oh, Lord Jesus.  This ain't happening, man.  It's happening.  This ain't happening, man.  This ain't happening.  It's happening.  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  I'm not a faggot, but I'll tell you what's next.  It's on the word dext.  Dext. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Dexter is my show.  And before you know, the season will be back, and he'll be killing some more hoes.  I use hoe a lot, but it doesn't matter.  Boo, you.  You're not a ghost.  Neither am I.  You don't scare me with your boos.  That's what I call my chick.  Carolina Mike's telling you, fat shady.  Fat shady.  Fat shady.  Fat shady.  Come on.  Come on.  Whip him out.  Oh, my God. 
[03:46:30]  I'm just...  Dude, I rap fucking good.  DJ, dude.  DJ, dude.  I'm a good rapper, man.  You're almost not fat again, by the way.  You put...  You put...  I was...  Dude, quitting smoking has fucked me bad.  Lopey.  Yeah.  I almost smoked this last weekend.  Really?  Yeah, dude.  I can't...  I haven't been this mentally fucked up since I quit drugs.  Eating in lieu of...  I ain't fucking chocolate-covered bacon, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm fighting it like a motherfucker, but I... 
[03:47:00]  Like, I'm really psychologically quitting smoking is...  I...  You don't realize it either.  All of a sudden, I'm just...  I can't take...  Like, people...  I want to punch everybody in the face.  Yeah.  You just want to fucking...  What the fuck?  Like, I was going to the airport, and he took the...  A different way, and I'm like, where the fuck are you going?  And he's like, I'm gonna go this way, because there's traffic.  And I was like, oh, shit.  Fuck.  All right.  Yeah.  Like, the guy was looking out for me.  I snap.  I gotta...  I gotta...  It's gonna take a year for me to get off this non-smoking, but... 
[03:47:30]  I just hope I don't get fat again.  I don't want to do my sixth fat right now.  Just, uh...  Six?  Eat right in...  Yeah, my fifth one.  Do a little exercise.  That's all you got, though.  Anthony, you are a fucking...  Anthony, you...  Your body is thin.  Your body...  Is thin.  Your body...  Is thin.  It's thin.  It's thin.  Your body...  Is thin.  I'm ripped now.  Yeah, you're pretty shredded, dude.  Both of you guys are all...  Both of you guys are thin, man.  I mean, even if you get fat, you don't get fat. 
[03:48:00]  I'm being drunk when I said ripped.  If I could, dude, if I could have one vice, like, you know, like, drinking or something.  It's not a vice.  That's a necessity.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Ah, it's a photoshop from The Shining, where Jack Nicholson is coming through the bathroom  door, and Wendy is horrified with the knife in her hand, and it's a fucking one of those  vavoozlers sticking through the door instead of Jack Nicholson. 
[03:48:30]  That's actually his fucking...  His cock.  They have to put one of those over there, because he just became a man.  A vavoozler sticking through the door.  That's great.  She's horrified at it.  It looks like the guy that I rented the apartment off of, Billy Burr.  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  That rap took a lot out of me.  I bet.  Well, what else do you want to do?  It took a lot out of everybody, Bob.  What else do you want to do?  And you like the comedy right out of the show.  But it's not comedy.  It's artistic, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Rap isn't funny, dude. 
[03:49:00]  You're just flowing and feeling it.  I understand.  Dude, it's almost like inside of the rap, I feel...  It's almost like poetry.  Almost.  You know what I mean?  Because I can take any subject and make it into a rap, because I'm creative.  I use creativity with colors.  I see it in colors in my brain, like numbers and colors.  It doesn't come out as words.  You know what I'm saying?  We're not going to ask you to do another one.  No, I can't do another one.  I'm too tired.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not...  Let's save it.  Let's save it for the next time.  Yeah, save it, dude. 
[03:49:30]  It's going to go on my...  I got my CD coming out.  For real?  Yeah.  A new one?  Yeah, it's for rapping.  It's all raps.  It's not comedy.  Oh, boy.  Good luck.  What happened?  You don't like my raps?  I don't rap.  Not so much.  I'm going to actually rap to you.  When we go fly fishing...  I ain't going fly fishing with you.  Jesus Christ.  I'm not fucking begging.  I'm done with you.  Fucking Opie.  Oh, it's like hanging out with me.  It really is like talking to myself.  I love when I see myself in others.  It gives me great pleasure because I don't come across it often. 
[03:50:00]  Great pleasure.  Great pleasure, too.  I get pleasure to be here.  Not anymore, though.  Me and Bobby know which buttons to avoid with each other.  We just know.  Yeah.  You know, if we hung out for like a week, we'd be rolling around fighting.  Like someone would throw a punch.  Out of everyone that does the show, you and Bill Burr are the most like myself as far  as that fucking weird fucking personality thing goes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bill Burr would snap.  Hidden anger? 
[03:50:30]  No problem.  Dude, I lived with him for three years.  No fucking problem.  Thinly veiled anger?  Very, very thinly veiled.  Oh, how about when fucking Anthony said, shut up that one day?  To what?  He went, shut up.  I was talking and he was just joking.  He goes, shut up.  I went, fucking what?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking what?  I was like, Bobby.  I would never say anything bad to Bobby.  Dude, me and Billy used to, when we lived together, that thin veil of anger.  Became thick.  We used to play fucking rollerblade hockey on cement.  Dude, we'd, I mean, halfway through, we'd just great. 
[03:51:00]  Fucking clerks?  Dude, we'd fucking throw each other.  Into the fences and stuff?  Into the fences and rollerblades.  Dude, cement into the fences.  Yeah.  No, onto the fucking cement wall.  We'd run each other into walls and then just be like, what the fuck?  We used to play football.  I remember I grabbed a fistful of grass and held it up, shook it, and then threw it down  to the ground.  That's very, very aggressive with you two, I guess.  It's bad.  It's from that shitty, from that shitty male fucking upbringing, man. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, fucking abuse, you know, just men fucking beating the shit out of you and, I mean, what  did you, you had a, your childhood was crazy, but it wasn't physically abusive.  No, no, I was mentally just fucked up.  It was one of those like, oh my God, I just, I'm seeing, just fighting all the time.  Yeah, I got punched in the face, dude.  I got beat up.  My father used to throw me downstairs and shit.  I got, I got the strap every so often, the strap.  I didn't get a strap.  It's like, ah, fucking, what are you, and he would, he would do the, the fucking cadence. 
[03:52:00]  Don't ever do that again or I will get the strap and, you're like, oh my God, how long  is it?  All I'm thinking is, could you just say the end or something?  Mental abuse.  I had, I had that.  Right.  And had that as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where we're similar with our upbrings, the mental shit.  I got my, I had one, I had one syllable, punched to the face.  That was it?  Yeah, stupid.  That's fucking.  Boom.  Hey, dummy.  Right in the fucking face.  I remember he punched me in the face in fifth grade, dude. 
[03:52:30]  I just remember standing in a vestibule and it was raining out crying with a black eye.  What did you do?  I had to go to school and the nun.  No, what did you do to get punched?  Nothing.  He just figured he'd wail you in the head.  Dude, he was a mother.  You must have said something though.  Nah, dude.  Nah, I blame it on you.  It was your fault.  You too.  You're going to be a good dad.  So was the ass raping.  It's your fault.  You were looking all sexy.  I've seen the young Bob Kelly pictures.  Dude, that was gorgeous.  Oh, stunning.  Tell the story.  I would have fucked my cheek like a lollipop. 
[03:53:00]  Tell the story.  I just went to, he punched me right in the face, dude.  I went to school.  The nun took me out of class.  I just got kicked out of Catholic school for that.  For being punched?  Yeah.  Why would they kick you out for being punched?  I don't know.  They didn't like that shit.  Oh.  Oh.  I love that.  I hope he's a fucking.  There was a sign just held up.  I hope he's a fucking confusing guy. 
[03:53:30]  I'm going to wrap.  I'm going to wrap now.  I'm going to wrap the rest of the show out.  Yeah.  Could that be a minute?  What?  You calling it, Ed?  I'm so calling it.  Ed's calling it.  I'm calling it.  I love when Ed calls it.  I haven't been able to call it in a while.  Ed just goes, fuck it.  I'm out.  I'm done.  Anthony's in his car driving before we can even get downstairs.  The weather is too fucking nice.  My bit failed.  What I was trying to do was get Bobby to really, you know, share a moment with us.  And then I held up a sign that said, shit, we have to wrap up right now. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  So you would have to stop your emotional story.  Oh, you wanted me to go on the beat?  Ah, yeah.  I'm sorry, dude.  I kind of fucked up.  You should have waited until I got into it.  I know.  I would have got into it.  You know I'm a needy douche.  I was so excited.  I panicked.  Yeah, you fucking held the sign up and it didn't make sense.  I just repeated the same thing I just said.  The execution of the bit was horrendous.  It was a good bit.  It was actually, it just made sense.  I was like, okay.  That's why the silence and you go on, you're very confusing. 
[03:54:30]  So I had to explain that to the audience.  God bless.  All right, listen.  What do you got, Bobby?  Because it's packing up.  Once I shut the laptop.  It's a wrap.  Bananas.  Friday, Saturday, two shows.  Poughkeepsie.  This weekend.  And I'm going to be, me and Jimmy Norton are going to be in Montreal at the Nasty Show.  I think I'm going to try to go to that.  It's going to be fucking great.  That's the 6th through the 13th.  I think I'm going to fucking go to Montreal, man.  It's going to be a blast.  By the way, I want to tell everybody that Monday, me and Jimmy are doing Red Eye. 
[03:55:00]  Jimmy is hosting.  What?  Yes.  What are you talking about?  Jimmy's hosting Red Eye.  Yes, he's guest hosting Red Eye.  That's great.  Because they're doing some kind of, you know, vacation or something.  I don't know what they're doing.  But so it's Jimmy Norton hosting me and Ann Coulter, the lovely Ann Coulter.  Jimmy's hosting.  Maybe then I can get back on that fucking show, those cocksuckers.  Oh, shit, yo.  I was on that show before anybody.  Well, you know something? 
[03:55:30]  You guys fucking, once they got real talent, they said fucking.  Just give them Voss's tape of Voss on the show and they'll let anyone on except Voss.  She had a rough one.  Did you say it?  No.  She had a rough one.  Was it bad?  It could be one of the worst television appearances I've ever seen anyone do ever.  We'll give you a copy.  We'll give you a copy.  Yeah, Arboud Dwyer had a better appearance.  It was just bad, man.  I'm going to go for it.  Can you YouTube it?  Because he was trying to be, you know, serious and have poignant stuff to say. 
[03:56:00]  And he just came off like, what?  Like everyone, when he was done, he had to keep saying, well, you know what I mean.  Because he could not verbalize what he meant.  He could not articulate an idea.  So he had to keep going, you know what I mean.  And people were just like, no.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, who?  Those guys did.  I'm getting goosebumps just out of goose chills.  Those guys go along with anything, though.  I know.  They're nice guys.  They'll fucking go.  Even if they don't like it, they'll fucking fake it. 
[03:56:30]  I know.  They'll go with it.  There's no way to get those guys to go, wow, you stink.  It's that close.  But there's no way.  Rich Bond.  Ah, fuck me.  You're going to have to play it again for you.  Oh, God.  Bobby, it's a pleasure.  Poughkeepsie.  Thank you, Brad.  Always a pleasure.  Fly fishing soon.  Yes, sir.  And, oh, and the Raw Dog show with Norton today you're doing.  Yeah, that was fucking a blast with Al.  Al's on it.  Al Jackson.  Al Jackson, funny guy.  Today at 4 o'clock on Raw Dog.  That's Sirius 104, XM 150, 1 o'clock if you're on the West Coast, right? 
[03:57:00]  Yes, sir.  The Jim Norton show.  Norton was telling me yesterday he loves co-hosting with you.  I really had a good time.  He's calling you like a co-host of this show.  I had a blast with him.  He's really good.  Good.  It's really good.  And it's a good show.  Awesome.  All right.  We'll do this again tomorrow.  Absolutely.  I'll do it, Ray. </pre>
