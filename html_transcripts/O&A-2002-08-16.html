<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a significant portion dedicated to the fallout from a listener contest that resulted in arrests.  Due to pending litigation, the hosts were legally restricted from discussing the specifics, leading to a comedic bit built around euphemisms, repeated exclamations of "My bad" and "We're going to get through this," and copious amounts of profanity.  Jim Norton was present in the studio throughout.

The show then pivoted to a detailed discussion of comedian Billy Staples' disastrous stand-up set, where he bombed spectacularly while opening for Jim Norton.  They played a recording of the performance, which was punctuated by brutal heckling from the audience.  A caller who attended the show corroborated the account, describing the devastating heckling.  The hosts also discussed Staples' subsequent emotional distress, including reported suicidal thoughts and isolation.  The audio recording of the disastrous set was played multiple times throughout the broadcast.

Other topics briefly touched upon included the upcoming baseball strike, with speculation on its recurring nature and the motivations of players and owners, as well as mentions of various news stories and other on-air personalities.

A second excerpt details a chaotic broadcast further complicated by persistent technical difficulties. The show started with a discussion on Opie and Anthony's contrasting views on children, with Anthony explaining his dislike stemmed from a preference for spontaneity and not hatred of children.  Martini Steve, a show intern, was present in the studio, serving martinis.  A significant segment focused on Tawny Stone, a 19-year-old woman whose provocative photos were displayed in a banner ad on a website, inexplicably visible even when the hosts weren't directly viewing the site.  The hosts discussed free pornography websites and Stone's appearance.  A caller, Dan, shared a downloaded audio clip discussing Mark Parenteau, a former radio personality they had competed against, with the conversation venturing into sexually suggestive innuendo.  Anthony's earlier rant about children was revisited, with Martini Steve creating a compiled segment, which the hosts jokingly disavowed. Technical issues plagued the playing of this segment, culminating in Martini Steve throwing a cart in frustration (though no martinis were spilled).

Scheduled guests Brian Regan and Anthony Michael Hall were mentioned, with Hall's appearance cancelled due to illness.  Several F.U. messages were played, and the hosts discussed Pat Benatar's hair.  Once Brian Regan arrived in studio, the conversation shifted to his experiences with bombing on stage, including an anecdote about a quiet corporate gig.  They also discussed the absurdity of a toaster oven with a "Pop-Tart" setting and a news segment about peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Technical problems, including a broken microphone, persisted.  Another playing of Billy Staples' disastrous stand-up performance took place, with Brian Regan and a phone call with Ron from Ron and Fez contributing to the discussion.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of Staples' performance and the technical difficulties.

A third segment intensely focused on the Billy Staples' disastrous Red Bank, New Jersey stand-up performance.  Opie, Anthony, and Brian Regan dissected a recording of the set, highlighting the relentless heckling, which ranged from general insults and obscenities to targeted attacks on Staples' appearance and comedic abilities. Staples' attempts at crowd control failed, often escalating the situation.  His jokes about tampons and a colonoscopy didn't land, and he lifted his shirt to reveal his "man boobs" in a failed attempt to connect with the audience. He stormed off stage multiple times. The audio quality was discussed, with the hosts acknowledging it didn't fully capture the heckling's intensity.  Staples' failed stomach stapling surgery was mentioned as a possible contributing factor to his distress.  Later, Pat Croce called in to discuss his new extreme sport, Slam Ball, showing a clip.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Staples' performance, speculation about his mental state, and encouragement from Jim Norton.

Finally, a fourth excerpt detailed a broadcast significantly disrupted at 2:40 PM due to unspecified restrictions. The planned show, including sound clips, stories, phone calls, and a UK interview, was scrapped, leading to improvisation.  The show then featured listener calls sharing what they "learned" that day, ranging from mundane observations to humorous anecdotes.  A Sam Adams billboard contest advertisement was mentioned, and the conversation included off-color jokes and personal anecdotes about awkward workplace interactions.  The final segment maintained a lighthearted but frustrated tone, reflecting the unplanned nature of the broadcast.

[00:01:30]  My bad.  Whatever.  I'll do what I want.  My bad.  My bad.  Stop.  This is no joke.  What do you think of stupid?  We're going to get through this, though.  You just got to keep your chin up.  Let's just stick with me.  That's why we'll turn this thing around.  But we're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this. 
[00:02:00]  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.

We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.  She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous. 
[00:02:30]  Now you get the hell out of here.  Oh, it's all good.  Hey, man, save me a fork.  Hey. 
[00:03:00]  All right.  We're tanks for nothing.  Tanks for nothing.  Walk it off, dick.  What are you, isn't it?  I got sort of a kind of brain. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, who's the stripper?  I'm the party pooper.  I'm so sore at.  Ouch.  Dude.  This is simply legal, isn't it?  I got nowhere else to go.  This is simply legal, isn't it?  I got nowhere else to go.  This is simply legal, isn't it?  This is simply legal, isn't it? 
[00:04:00]  You're fired.  This is simply legal, isn't it?  No!  This is simply legal, isn't it?  Hey, mule.  I hate this place.  I'm somebody sick. 
[00:04:30]  Time to be fed.  What the hell were you thinking?  This is simply legal, isn't it?  This is simply legal, isn't it?  Your balls are showing.  This is less fun than previously indicated.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren.  Hey, what's going on here?  Oh, brother.  We could just do this all day. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, that's one thing we can do.  We could do a show using sound bites to get our points across.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Liar!  Oh, boy.  Confess!  Liar!  Confess!  So what's new, man?  You're a liar!  You know something that you're not telling us, you slimy scumbag liar!  Yeah, thanks, dude.  Sweet, merciful crap! 
[00:05:30]  Liar!  Tell us what you know, you goddamn liar!  How you doing?  Hey!  What's up, Anthony?  I don't know what the hell I'm going to do today.  I have no idea.  Been in too many meetings.  This calls for the old Billy Barone.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Whoa, Billy, Billy, Billy.  This is a biggie. 
[00:06:00]  Let me know.  $40,000, Billy.  Whoa, calm down, Hope.  Hey, yes.  Yeah, well, we...  I swear to God, I'll pistol whip the next guy that says shenanigans.  What's new, Ant?  Well, there's a couple of things in the news, I guess we could talk about.  The baseball strike.  She was a whore. 
[00:06:30]  They've said it.  Just random clips.  They don't mean anything.  Seems like a lot of people are looking into things today.  Hey, we're just playing random clips, Anthony.  Dirty, dirty goop.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Just random clips.  They don't mean anything at all today.  Don't pay attention to your radio.  That's about shutting the hell up!  Yeah.  Well, we've been told that, yes? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah?  Let's see.  Baseball strike.  What else?  Elvis died.  Elvis, Elvis.  Elvis, he did.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  When did that happen?  We can't talk about, uh...  Hmm, let's see.  We like starting the show with the top story of the day.  Yeah.  Oh, a Harlem Little Leaguers cleared to play.  Stupid hooker!  Yeah.  Good, good.  They're in, and they're going to be able to play in the Little League World Series. 
[00:07:30]  I can tell you this much.  I slept like a baby last night.  Did you?  Yeah, I had a good night's sleep for the first time in three days.  A little tired.  The world is a jungle.  And if you want my advice, Anthony, don't expect happiness.  You won't get it.  People let you down.  And I'm not naming any names.  But in the end, you die in your own arms.  Okay, terrific.  Be quiet, sir.  That's what we're doing.  We're being quiet.  Yeah, we were instructed by lawyers. 
[00:08:00]  Lawyers again!  Wait, don't talk for a second.  What?  What's the matter?  Write it down.  What's the problem, Rick?  Things change by minute.  Minute by minute.  Mm-hmm.  You guys are playing with fire.  We are?  Oh, no, that's not what it says.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  You dick.  Ken would like us to move on.  We haven't even said anything. 
[00:08:30]  We haven't touched on anything.  I was just talking about the baseball strike coming up August 30th.  What a shame.  The Yankees are doing so well.  Move on to what?  Well, maybe we could take suggestions from the audience.  Oh, that'll work.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Look at this call.  I don't even see one call we can really put on the air.  No, we can't go to anything.  I know what I can say.  We had our event yesterday.  We had our little event, our contest. 
[00:09:00]  And during the course of that contest, some of the contestants were arrested.  That's just a fact.  And we can't talk about it because things are still up in the air.  So the lawyers have instructed us.  Let's put it this way.  The couple is still arrested.  Yeah.  And the couple is still in jail.  And since there is still legalities going on, we can't talk about anything. 
[00:09:30]  We're being gagged by the lawyers with their legal mumbo-jumbo.  Hey, we just made CNN.  Hey, Channel 5 in Chicago.  Oh, really?  Oh, I could do it this way.  Jersey Bob? 
[00:10:00]  People are asking me questions on instant feedback.  Ken is really freaking out.  We're not saying anything.  Is he?  We're not.  We're not saying anything.  We've been put in a very awkward position.  Yeah.  Where we cannot even discuss in the slightest.  And for the first time, I will say I understand with what they want us to do.  Oh, they're going crazy.  But it just puts us in a very awkward situation because we're here to do a radio show.  And we can talk about the biggest thing that's happening with this radio show. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  So, we can't even discuss it.  Not even in the slightest.  Good.  I asked about certain peripheral issues that maybe we could be able to talk about.  Some shows I was watching on TV last night at around 11 o'clock and 10 o'clock.  And certain reactions that were happening around on the news.  And I couldn't talk about that.  They said no.  No. 
[00:11:00]  Pending litigation.  That's what they say.  That's the excuse I used.  That's the old gag I used to use.  Well, there's a lot.  I'm in hand.  I guess there's a lot that we'll be able to say eventually.  Easy, Opie.  What are you saying?  Eventually, right?  What?  No.  What?  Who?  Shut up.  No.  What did you say?  So, yeah.  A huge story.  And we really can't even discuss it.  I would love to. 
[00:11:30]  Can we talk about how, um...  Let me look...  No.  I'll just say no right now.  No.  The guy with the big camera lens outside?  No.  I heard no.  We can't even discuss anything.  Ask Ken if we could talk about the paparazzi.  You just did.  And how they didn't recognize Ant and I as we walked right by him.  And they looked at us and said, no, that's not them.  They're all waiting to snap pictures.  No.  Okay.  So, we better not talk about that. 
[00:12:00]  Well, that's just...  There's nothing to talk about!  No?  What do you think?  I was reading about other things last night?  I'm getting head sick.  No?  No.  Okay.  No.  Thumbs down.  Thumbs down.  All right.  Well.  Move on.  Move on.  Okay.  We're moving on.  Okay.  That is as much as the lawyers will allow us to say about this.  So, if you're calling in reference to this, you'll knock it on the air. 
[00:12:30]  Unfortunately, we can't discuss it.  I'd love to.  I'm going to love hearing my voice on the news with the little VU meter going or the radio dial going and saying, we can't talk about it.  No comment.  No comment?  Yeah.  All right.  Say your official thing that'll end up on the audio tracks tonight.  Go ahead.  I don't know nothing.  Oh, that's a good one.  I don't, though.  Put a real dopey picture of you up there and go, I don't know nothing. 
[00:13:00]  I don't know nothing.  We're out of the loop.  We really don't know anything.  Yeah.  And there's, we definitely have a concern for our listeners that are still being held.  And it would probably be a good idea to move on.  How's that?  Here we go.  Okay.  Ah, let me see.  Oh, I was doing so much show prep last night.  Hmm.  It's not like I didn't have the phone in my hand every two seconds. 
[00:13:30]  Talking to everybody.  Me and Opie haven't spoken on the phone that much in years.  No.  And then Rick and Ben, panicky Ben.  Can we, can we say, um, someone from, um, the UK contacted us?  Yes.  It was the Queen.  No?  No.  No.  Okay.  No.  Can't, uh, no.  Huh?  So don't say it.  Don't even mention England in any way.  Do we have the Billy Staples tape ready to go? 
[00:14:00]  Oh!  Billy Staples.  That's a subject we could hit on.  Which means we're going to have to get Ron and Fez on the phone.  We're still working on it.  What?  Rick.  You know what?  He was supposed to have cut it up and edited it, but Rick was in a two-hour meeting.  That cannot be discussed.  Exactly.  Rick was in a two-hour meeting.  Was it about my September 7th gig in Long Island?  You're the worst.  You're the worst.  Really, Rick?  Yeah.  Hold that up again.  Show Opie.  There you go.  At least you have something to fall back on, my friend.  Opie, look. 
[00:14:30]  You are the worst.  This is it for me.  That means it's got to be true.  It's got to be true.  That's got to be true.  It's got to be true.  What are we talking about?  Look.  Just look at the letters.  AP?  No, don't say it.  What does that mean, though?  It means it's got to be true.  What's got to be true?  I don't know.  Stop it.  What?  You're putting me in a weird position.  This one was your idea.  Not as weird as the...  What?  Who?  I didn't say anything.  This was your idea.  What was? 
[00:15:00]  What was?  What was my idea?  It was...  Nothing was my idea.  I'm not the idea guy.  Oh.  I'm not.  I'm not the idea guy.  I'm just saying it was your idea to do a show today.  Hey, Jim Norton, how about some yucks?  Jesus.  If we ever needed a Jim Norton in the studio today...  You're right.  I really am contributing nothing.  I just don't want to say the wrong thing.  Right.  Because let's face it, you're the pansy of the group.  Look, I'm the first one to go. 
[00:15:30]  If there's a real problem and they want to set an example, you don't set it with Oprah  rant, you set it with the little blubbery-breasted friend.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I will definitely be the we're not kidding around example.  Why don't we get the Billy Staples tape together?  Because that is some really good radio.  I listened to Billy on...  Is it almost done?  Who's working on it?  We just got to clean up.  There's a lot of cursing and we still got to clean up.  Rick, we need it.  Oh, he was cursing his ass off.  We need it in like 15 minutes because we can't do this for like another hour. 
[00:16:00]  I was listening to Ron and Fez.  They come on in New York after our show.  Why don't we set up the whole Billy Staples thing again?  Well, Billy Staples used to be on our show.  He used to be like one of the, I don't know, cast of characters, a little rotating cast of  characters that come and go during the years.  And he was one of them.  He worked with another guy, Paul Bond.  They were air-sick productions, if you remember.  He used to write some song parodies.  And occasionally we'd play one.  And then something, it just kind of, times changed, things changed, and he moved on. 
[00:16:30]  And he moved on to the Ron and Fez show.  Come on after us.  And he changed from fat guy, which we used to call him, to Billy Staples because he got  that stomach stapling surgery.  And he slimmed down a little bit.  Yeah.  Then he plumped up a little bit and he's having trouble with his weight again.  But in nowhere near where it was, he couldn't even walk.  His knees would buckle when he walked.  So, uh, he, he, he thought it would be a good idea to, uh, go on stage at one of Norton's 
[00:17:00]  shows recently at, uh, Red Bank.  Yeah.  Red Bank.  A couple weeks ago.  Rich Voss.  He asked you.  Was hosting to, uh, you know.  Not, but not in a groveling way.  We were talking, because we were going on vacation.  We were away.  Mm-hmm.  And Ron and Fez were great.  Were helping me out and they were mentioning the show.  And Billy's like, hey, I'll do it with you.  Kind of kidding around.  I'm like, you know what, dude?  Yeah, do it with me.  Why not?  But, you know what I mean?  It's like, he's a buddy of mine, so put him on.  Do the show.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, he did.  So he, uh, he, he decided he wanted to do this. 
[00:17:30]  Rich Voss was, uh, going to open up the show and, and then, uh, bring on Billy.  And then a little more Rich Voss.  And then Norton comes out and destroys the crowd.  Well, the, the people were, were killing Billy, uh, before he even hit the stage.  I, I just heard about it.  Uh, I heard it was brutal.  Just a brutal attack on Billy.  Everything from the clothes he was wearing.  I hear he had a big orange shirt on. 
[00:18:00]  And people in the front just kept calling him, shut up, you big effing pumpkin.  They were calling him a big effing pumpkin.  And, and just heckling to, to the point where he could not get one line out.  He never got to do his act.  Whether it was funny or not.  Right.  He couldn't do anything.  Right.  He leaves the stage.  Tells everybody to go eff themselves and just leaves the stage.  Rich Voss comes back on to, uh, an ovation I've never heard from Voss.  They love just having anybody else on stage. 
[00:18:30]  And talks Billy to, into coming back on stage.  He goes, try two more.  Two more.  So Billy comes back out.  And now the crowd, even worse.  He tries again to get into the flow of an act.  And they just, they leveled him.  So now he's been MIA ever since that night.  He, uh, has not shown up for work on Ron and Fez's show.  Um, and last night they finally got in touch with him.  He's, he's shacked up somewhere in PA.  He's in Pennsylvania hanging out. 
[00:19:00]  He says he cannot face the people in, uh, the station.  He feels he cannot walk down the hallways because he feels so degraded.  Uh, he, he also is, uh, sounded like he's on the verge of suicide.  He said his life has been falling apart.  Uh, he lost everything.  He, he now has to live back with his mother.  And, uh, he's, he's really going through tough times.  And the one thing he had, the one thing that kept him going was the dream of, of being a 
[00:19:30]  popular stand-up comic.  And he had been doing stand-up for nine years.  And, uh, he, he said when you're booed off a stage like that, it just crushes you.  Especially when that is all you have to live for.  Isn't he in, in Pennsylvania somewhere too?  Yeah, that's where he's shacked up.  He wasn't even in the area?  No.  Yeah.  He just left the area because, and you know why he left?  He wanted to drive out of the range of the station.  He did not want to be in the range where any radio might be on where he passes by and 
[00:20:00]  hears people talking about how, you know, people destroyed him.  He's being way too hard on himself because the listeners decided to not give him a chance.  They busted his balls.  It wasn't, it wasn't even about his, uh, his jokes or his act.  He never even had a chance officially.  And it was set up that way by, by, uh, I, well, mostly Ron and Fez, I would think.  He was a ball buster.  And their listeners, they were ball busting him pretty bad and stuff.  And they, they pretty much told everybody, and, and I guess we did as well to a certain 
[00:20:30]  extent, to go there and just kill him.  Just kill him.  You want me to read the review of the Staples show that was, is on, uh, redbank.com?  Sure.  This is brutal.  It's, uh, showtime at the Count Basie.  It's what they call it.  It was at the Count Basie Theater.  Uh, watching Billy Staples set at the Count Basie Theater fell somewhere between witnessing  a seal clubbing and watching Robert De Niro play Russian roulette in a Vietnam prison camp.  Billy Staples, a stand-up comedian and regular on the Ron and Fez show, performed in front of 
[00:21:00]  the sold-out crowd at the recent Jim Norton show on August 10th.  Well, I shouldn't really say performed.  It was more like he was ripped to shreds by the ravenous hordes of fans that made up  the audience.  The show, which was hosted by stand-up comic Rich Voss, was to feature a small set by Billy  Staples.  I think the whole ordeal lasted about five minutes, uh, though I'm sure it felt like  two or three days of prison time for Billy.  Prison shower time.  Believe it or not, 30 seconds into the routine, people were actually asking for Voss back,  despite the fact that Voss is usually referred to as being as funny as cancer. 
[00:21:30]  Where, it's all a big joke, the man's a great comic.  Even with all the heckling he had to deal with, he pulled it off.  If only Billy could have been so lucky.  Even before the giant orange shirt wearing Billy Staples put his first foot on the stage,  the cries of, you suck, go home and kill yourself, hit the poor sap like a bag of hate.  There really wasn't anything he could do to help things.  The truth, the crowd would have hurled insults at sick children. 
[00:22:00]  There were, however, uh, some things he could have, uh, could do to make it worse, and that's  where Billy shined brightest.  Now, I'm no stand-up, uh, comic, but I'll be willing to beat, uh, to bet, sorry, when we  get down to the middle of this, it got all fuzzy on my monitor.  I need a new monitor in here.  Uh, that any joke that starts out with, anyone ever have a colonoscopy is not going to go over  too well with a bunch of drunken 20-year-olds, and when the punchline is, it's a real pain 
[00:22:30]  in the ass, you might as well throw a bag of ground beef in your pants and spend the  afternoon at Louie Anderson's place.  Oh, God.  Sure enough, that's the direction Billy went.  Even asking hecklers to repeat their insults.  I think there was even a Fabio joke in there.  Bad move, poor fella.  He would do that, he would, he would, uh, uh, be standing there, and, and from what  I heard, people would, yelling, uh, you suck and insults, and then he'd go, what? 
[00:23:00]  What?  Yeah, what'd you say?  What'd you say?  And give the heckler a chance to say it again.  And louder.  And then, of course, the headliner for the evening did not disappoint.  Jim Norton was great, and, uh, they, then he talked about how people were yelling out  stuff during your set, but you're kind of used to that.  Well, they yell out show stuff.  Like tussle.  Yeah, yeah, that's not hateful.  They yell out tussle.  Tussle my hair, Norton.  Yeah, they just yell out, you know, you stink, and I don't like you.  It's cool.  Yeah.  But they're not giving me a hard time.  They're just having fun.  They really gave Billy a hard time, and there wasn't much he could do, man. 
[00:23:30]  Um, it threw him off.  You could see it threw him off.  I didn't feel bad for him, because I'm a comic.  I've been through that.  It's like, it happens.  And the odds were against him, and it's funny.  It's like, come on, man, you took it on the chin, you took it like a trooper.  Yeah, he's taking it way too hard.  No, and it wasn't about his act.  It wasn't about his act.  Let me just finish off this thing real quick.  It says, uh, Norton put on a great show.  It was just about the best part of the night.  The best part, that is, until later that evening, when Lady Di and Marion, the retarded  Laverne and Shirley from, uh, Opie and Anthony fame, danced at the Walt Street pub. 
[00:24:00]  Ugh!  That pulls on the old American heartstrings both of these messes in their busted glory,  slopping down glasses of Budweiser and trying to forget.  If only Billy could.  News at 11.  Um, well, we got the tape, Anthony.  Yeah.  We finally got the tape from Red Bank.  I have not heard it.  It is, uh, brutal.  I think the audio of the crowd, unfortunately, doesn't really come up.  Uh, you could kind of hear it, and especially when they were really yelling. 
[00:24:30]  You know how much they charged to tape that whole show?  Because I needed it set for other purposes.  Yeah.  Uh, and I heard that the audio on the crowd isn't that great.  I'm furious.  You can barely hear that.  You can barely hear the audio of the crowd.  Yeah, when you're making the tape, why do you, who needs the audience, Mike?  You know, you might as well just have me talking to him.  I have an audience, Mike.  Billy Staples is, uh, he's crystal clear, and you definitely get a feel for what the  F is going on between him and the audience.  You absolutely know, because he cannot get a word out.  He starts, he tries to get into something, tries to get into one of his bits, uh, or a joke  or something, and, and the people are just non-stop, and he's stuttering, he's stopping, 
[00:25:00]  he's going, come on, guys, seriously, seriously.  He says, seriously, so many times, which means, please, please shut up so I can say this.  You never let them win.  Even if you bomb, you cannot control if they're going to yell at you or scream.  You can't make them not, uh, but you just got to get F you and mean it.  You really got to be ready.  All right, I'm going to bomb, and I'm going to go down having a good time and swinging,  and I think he got, he wanted to do well, and it's like, dude, it's all right if you 
[00:25:30]  don't do well.  You do what you do, and if they don't do well, so what?  He was so excited.  It was a huge gig for the guy.  Dude, I'll put him on in my next gig.  I don't care.  It's cool.  He comes out all like, uh, light on the, on his feet, kind of bouncing out like, hey,  everybody.  He was ready to go.  Hey.  Well-pressed orange shirt.  Yeah.  Anybody have a colonoscopy?  Huh?  And they started just pounding him.  And then he goes, oh, I'm the only one.  And I'll tell you one thing, though, a bombing like that, believe it or not,  whether he understands this or not, taking it like that where they're yelling and screaming 
[00:26:00]  before you hit the mic is better than having a set where it's like they just stare at you  and it's like, oh, man, they really are ready to laugh, and I stink.  That's worse.  Oh, oh, yeah.  This is like one you write off and you go, dude, they were busting my balls.  That's all it was.  Yeah, let's go to the phones.  Barbara wants in.  Hey, Barbara, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I was at the show in Red Bank.  Yeah, okay.  And I kind of felt bad for him because no one really gave him a chance to talk,  and we were sitting there trying to listen, and the poor guy never really got a chance  to even get a joke out.  He never had a chance.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  That's why he shouldn't feel bad about himself.  Well, yeah, that's true, but, I mean, in a way, I felt like Rich Voss was able to at  least get the audience back on his side after a while, whereas Billy Staples just didn't  even know what to say.  Well, Voss, you have to realize, Billy's been doing radio for a while, so he hasn't been up  as much because of the hours he's only getting on, like, once a week, so he's probably a  little bit, like, just needs a little bit more stage time just to get back to where he  would have been.  You understand what I mean?  Yeah, but, you know...  He was on every night getting yelled at.  You know something, though?  The way he sounded on Rana Fez last night, I wanted Don Corleone to slap him in the face. 
[00:27:00]  He just sounded like, you know, I had this dream.  It was this.  It was, you know, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get back on stage again?  Come on.  Just get on.  Buck up, little camper.  Get on.  If they were a great crowd, but they were just busting your balls, dude, it isn't like they  were so ready for you and, like, all right, let's give them a chance, and then you just  bomb.  They did it on purpose.  I think they were showing some 0-1-8 love.  Dude, they emailed me with that, like, you know, we really felt bad for Billy. 
[00:27:30]  We gave him a hard time.  I got, like, 50 emails saying we felt bad for Billy.  Well, we got to play the audio.  Yeah.  And it will prove that Billy Staples never had a chance.  He didn't.  It really wasn't about his act.  Dude, sometimes I did a gig, which is done now, for the Cleveland Browns, and I had a  decent set.  I did it, and my first joke got a zero, and I mean nothing.  The whole team stared at me, and I'm like, I am really going to bomb.  The next couple of jokes started to work.  Had they been yelling and screaming, I would have just went down in flames. 
[00:28:00]  You understand what I mean?  It happens.  They were a good crowd.  They were mellow, so I was able to recover, and I still didn't even kill.  It was just good.  Well, the way they were talking last night to Billy, they just kept, and they kept saying,  well, you know, it's Norton's crowd.  It's Norton's show.  It was Norton.  And I just, it was almost like they were rubbing it in.  It was almost like they were rubbing it into Billy.  Like, see, Billy, when you get in front of an entire theater of people that are there 
[00:28:30]  to see one guy, oh, it was just brutal.  But that's not, but no, man.  Yeah, but they were just turning the screws last night to make for good radio, and I  hope he didn't take it personally.  He did.  He took it so personally.  What do you expect?  Ron and Fez to, you know, do a whole hour with everyone calling up, comforting the guy?  It's hard, though, man.  Some people were.  Oh, they were a little bit?  Some people were comforting him.  I was getting sick.  Dude, you got to give him a break.  He's had a tough time.  It does suck, though, and it seems like everything's piling up, you know.  I'm not saying it wasn't tough or anything, but the way he came off sounding on the air last night 
[00:29:00]  was really just kind of, oh.  I just wish I could have talked to him for a few minutes ago, because I heard he left  me an apology to somebody like Tom Horton.  I'm sorry.  Like, for what?  Not your fault, dude.  Relax.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break?  The audio's just about done.  You got to hear it for yourself.  Yeah.  And we'll definitely give it to Ron and Fez so they can have it for tonight's show here  in New York as well, okay?  Right.  As we attempt to move on, Anthony.  Attempting.  What we got?

Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up.  We're shutting up.  It's best that we shut up for now.  They're all pink on the inside.  Hey!  Although, all the other radio shows talking about us.  Oops.  Oops! 
[00:32:30]  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027 outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  I was screaming in the office, though.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Well, stuff I can't talk about.  But I was screaming.  Like, I was just, ugh, ugh.  So, one day, one day, we'll be able to discuss.  A lot of people assuming a lot.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  So, baseball looks like, what, they're striking August 30th?  Yeah.  Know why they could strike?  Good news for the Mets.  Know why they could continue to strike?  Why?  Every few years.  Because we always come back.  Yep.  That's why, that's the only reason why they're striking again.  They don't give a flying F about the fans because they know that we'll be back.  They got people that figure out how much money they're going to lose in the short term. 
[00:33:30]  And they figure out, you know, is it worth to lose this much money in the short term knowing that eventually we will be back.  Of course.  They don't care.  All these stupid news stations could interview all the fans they want.  And the fans could say, you know, well, maybe this time I'm not coming back.  You know what?  Major League Baseball doesn't care.  They don't care about your interviews.  They don't care you're interviewing the fans.  Because they know the fans will be back.  And that's the only reason they're able to strike again. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  End of story.  End of story.  You know how I kind of talk about how I'm a Mets fan?  The fact of the matter is I couldn't even name the starting lineup of the Mets.  I couldn't tell you.  You know why?  Because I'm not as interested in baseball like I used to be.  Right.  Okay.  Well, besides, the Mets are having a horrible year.  And they have a really bad losing streak.  So maybe it's good that they're striking.  But that's why they're striking.  You don't think they've got people to figure it all out? 
[00:34:30]  You know?  What are the odds?  The fans are going to come back?  How long is it going to take?  People, like I said, people will come back.  If your team is doing well, if the team that you like to go see is doing well, the stadium will be packed.  Regardless of if they just came back from a strike and everyone's pissed off.  Because for every person that isn't going to show up, there's somebody behind them that's going to buy the ticket and get in there that wants to see a team that's doing well.  If a team's doing crappy and they don't really have a fan base, they won't be there. 
[00:35:00]  They won't be watching whether there's a strike or not.  I don't even understand.  And I consider myself kind of savvy as far as the news goes.  I like to be informed.  And I have no clue what this strike is about.  None.  A bunch of scumbag millionaires.  Cops and firemen can't get a raise.  But they said A-Rod will be losing $114,000 a day if they strike.  That's the kind of money they're dealing with.  They're a bunch of babies. 
[00:35:30]  All of them.  Yeah.  I don't care if they have a cap or if they don't have a cap.  Prices are never going down when you go to the stadium.  Ever.  If they don't have a cap, you're still going to get raped.  If they do, you're going to get raped.  I understand.  Obviously, it's about money.  But I have no clue why it's about money.  Who's money?  Who's paying?  Who's not paying?  Who wants more?  Is it between owners?  Is it between the players and owners?  The players are bitching.  If you have a thing, if you have any type of cap, we're going to lose money.  Or if you have a luxury tax, we're going to lose money. 
[00:36:00]  And if the owners say we're not going to pay more than, say, $30,000, then that's collusion.  Yeah, the luxury tax thing.  You can't win.  What the hell is the luxury tax?  It's a bunch of dumb small market teams that aren't winning, sniveling.  It's like a welfare system for baseball.  They're all bellyaching about all the Yankees and the big market teams.  Well, I understand.  They want teams like the Yankees that spend a lot of money on their players.  Because they can.  To not be able to spend that much money.  So how would they use this luxury tax to restrict how much money the Yankees spend?  I don't know specifics.  See, that's what I mean. 
[00:36:30]  I don't even understand.  I hear luxury tax and I go, what?  Isn't that a spot on Monopoly?  That I land on every goddamn time I go around the board.  Every time I land on luxury tax.  You pay, if you spend over the cap, you pay a certain tax.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Shut up, shut up.  Shut up!  Okay.  If you spend over the cap, you pay a tax and that goes, I believe, into the smaller market team.  Oh, oh, oh.  So if you then want to buy some key players, you spend money over your cap, you get taxed, 
[00:37:00]  and that tax goes into a kitty for the crappy small market team.  Market, yes.  That then can afford better players because you just bought.  That is ridiculous.  It's communism.  Yeah.  The Baltimore Orioles, look at what their payroll is, and they stink.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, it does help to have money, but I'm so tired of small market.  Hey, man, we're a small market, really?  Then get out of baseball.  Montreal is considered a small market.  They don't support baseball. 
[00:37:30]  They don't like it.  Yeah.  The team is doing well, and they still don't, I don't think, sell out every night.  Yeah.  Get rid of it in Montreal.  George, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You know, I think they're different than in 94.  In 94, you know, you had people coming back.  Now, after September 11, these are just like million-dollar babies.  I agree.  You know what?  All it's going to take is another Mark McGuire thing or Barry Bonds going for 75 homers.  You guys, and I'm in there, too, because I'm sure I'll be going back to the park because 
[00:38:00]  I get tickets here and there.  We're going back.  I don't know about that.  And Major League Baseball would not be setting another strike date if they didn't think they  could get away with it again.  And, dude, the owners are the worst.  Because it comes down to money.  And eventually, if they think, you know, this time we're screwed, you know, the whole league  is F because the fans aren't coming back, you know what?  They would try to work it out.  Because it's all about the bottom dollar.  And I'm telling you, they just know that the fans are coming back eventually. 
[00:38:30]  Who is it that owns the White Sox?  Jerry something?  I can't remember his name.  Reinsdorf.  Right, it is Reinsdorf.  He, I think he was one of the biggest complainers about the salaries.  And then when they came back from the strike, he gave Frank Thomas, wasn't it, 50 million?  Or was it Albert Bell?  It was some monster contract this jackass handed out.  You don't want to pay it?  Don't pay it.  Don't worry about what the Yankees are doing.  Mind your business and don't spend what you don't want to spend, creeps.  At what point do your earnings stop you from having a union, though?  I mean, these guys need to pay $250,000.  Yeah.  You don't need a union at that point. 
[00:39:00]  No, no.  The union, yeah, exactly.  So who's to blame?  Who's the bad guy here?  Who's the bad guy here?  I've got to say the players.  They're all, not all of them.  The players are the bad guys because they.  If you own a business.  Yeah.  If you own a business and you can hire who you want to hire and pay them what you want.  If your business doesn't good in that state, you're up.  Right.  Why?  Here's the problem, though.  And I know I've played devil's advocate.  For many, many, many years, the owners had that type of control.  And when you look at the way they paid the players back then, I mean, they certainly were not fair with them. 
[00:39:30]  So it's like you can't give the owners too much.  And the players are as greedy as they.  Everyone's greedy.  It's all of them.  They're all greedy.  You know, you've got to understand, too.  But when they pay a player like A-Rod that many millions of dollars, it's almost like you're putting it into advertising.  You're getting the player, but you're also getting the player that is worth this many millions of dollars.  So now it kind of makes it like you want to go see him.  I've got to go see the guy that's worth $250 million.  And they stink, the Rangers.  They stink. 
[00:40:00]  Get pitching, you idiot.  It's all pitching.  You're not just paying for the player.  You're not just paying for the player and his talents.  The more you pay, the more people want to go and see that highly paid player, the star, and then they go and buy seats in the stadium.  It's almost like it's part of an advert.  It's part advertising.  It's all pitching.  And the fact they spend that kind of money on a hitter they don't deserve to, and that's poor management.  Why do you think Boston is at least around every year?  Because of the money they give Pedro.  Maybe they don't win the series, but they're good every year. 
[00:40:30]  They're in contention.  Look what Arizona did with stupid Randy Johnson and Colby gets cancer, Curt Schilling.  It's all pitching.  Hey, what's wrong with Curt Schilling?  I hate him.  The Yankees could never beat him.  Ever.  Yeah.  He's an old friend of mine, you hate him.  Is he really?  I hate him.  He plays EverQuest, too, you know.  He kills the Yankees.  Does he really?  He's very heavily into the computer game EverQuest.  And the cancer thing, his wife has it.  Skin cancer.  Well, it didn't seem to stop him from pitching well against the Yankees.  Is that faster?  They have never been able to beat Schilling.  The skin cancer has affected his family so badly that he doesn't even allow his kids to play during the day. 
[00:41:00]  Outside.  Yeah.  Look at you.  You're a wealth of information.  He's an old pal, so I keep up on Curt Schilling.  One of your old drinking buddies from where?  Yeah, I was part of one of the Sports Illustrated articles on Curt Schilling.  There was a story about Curt Schilling having a bad outing, I think, with Roger Clemens when they were both in minor league ball or something.  Or maybe they were playing. 
[00:41:30]  I don't know.  And they asked Curt about his performance.  And he said, well, the night before I was out with a bunch of radio guys.  I swear to God.  Oh.  I was one of those radio guys.  Well, your old pal kills the Yankees, and I don't like him for it.  Even when he was Miss Philly, they'd play interleague.  They could never be Schilling.  It's all pitching.  All pitching.  All right.  How the Yankees win every year.  They have Rivera.  They have Pettit.  El Duque.  But all this talk about the fans not coming back, that's pretty silly.  I think people would be more disgusted this time. 
[00:42:00]  I really do.  It would take a lot longer.  What about 94?  People were outraged.  Some stayed away for a little while, but within what?  A little over a season, it was back to normal.  Things have just been, I think, believe it, the 11th, people look at things a little bit differently.  More has been put into perspective.  And I think that effect will take place for a while.  People are like, ugh, that's what you're complaining about, you babies?  Yeah, I know.  I hope so, but I'm not holding out hope on that.  No way.  We're going to go on strike.  Every eight years, these jizz bags can't work out. 
[00:42:30]  They're million-dollar money problems.  All of them.  They are just a dissent.  And they keep putting in new teams and diluting the pitching in the market because the owners  get, like, millions every time there's a new team.  And the new teams blow, and the cities don't want them, so they switch cities.  They all suck.  So aggravating.  If your fans don't support it, get out of the city.  That's it.  All right.  Why don't we break again?  Look at that.  We did a little break on the baseball strike.  It was kind of intelligent, too.  Good, good.  Sorry, Doug. 
[00:43:00]  Doug, no, can't.  Frank, yes, I realize.  No, can't.  Can't.  Well, sorry.  It sounds like you're listening to the fan.  Yeah, they're getting very angry.  But we told you at the top of the show, we can't talk about things right now.  Yesterday.  We got a couple of our listeners still in jail, and it's best that we all just shut up right now. 
[00:43:30]  So, anyway.  How much was, I'll get off topic.  How much was that thunder and lightning today freaking you out right by the building?  It was only raining over the building for a while.  Hilarious.  It was a bolt of lightning that I swear was going to strike Opie as he sat in his chair,  and the loudest clap of thunder.  Ken Stevens, when we were taking one of many calls with him.  Yeah, a lot of calls today.  He jumped when he heard that lightning.  But at one point, it was very strange. 
[00:44:00]  It was only raining over this building.  And really hard.  A little creepy.  I do believe they call that a nest storm.  A little creepy.  Hey, wheelchair Fred, we can talk to him.  Oh, there we go.  See how his Pat Benatar show went.  I'm so pissed off today, too.  Because without saying stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So much stuff to talk about.  You talk about not having to prepare for a radio show.  So much stuff to talk about. 
[00:44:30]  Little ins and outs and things.  Nothing.  Nothing.  We've been allowed nothing.  I was asking questions about what I could talk about.  And I just heard over the speakerphone.  No.  No.  No.  Don't even think it.  No.  Oh, God.  Don't show.  I want to talk about that.  Can I say this much?  No.  What?  Well, they're dumping out down the hall. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, Ken K. Stevens on the dump button today.  The big boss on the dump button himself.  Making sure.  Don't even.  I'm dumping that one.  Don't, don't.  Are you insane?  Don't.  Stop.  You idiot.  That was funny.  I know.  It's all timing, guys.  If I can't say this, then I can't say this.  It's not really about it too much, really.  Yeah.  Ben had me so freaked out last night. 
[00:45:30]  I almost went in your pants.  I almost decided to visit another state in the middle of the night.  Buffalo?  It's not the French Revolution.  You don't have to leave.  What's the matter with you?  The French Revolution.  You were going to pack a bag and go on the lam?  And sneak out into the dark of night?  But Anne understands.  Yeah.  That is pretty freaked.  Pete Panic over there?  Ben, you cannot go to Ben. 
[00:46:00]  And I'm not talking about it.  I'm talking about any crisis situation.  Anything that comes up that deserves attention.  Let me tell you this much.  Ben will call you and freak you out.  Yeah.  But let me start by saying this.  When this show goes to the mattresses, we're the worst.  Yeah.  We all stink.  Yeah.  We all get each other really paranoid.  Clemenza knows how to handle the mattresses.  He just goes, eh, you know, we got to go through this thing every eight years or so. 
[00:46:30]  Gets rid of the bad blood.  I'm calling Ope last night.  I called you, of course.  There was no answer.  I'm calling him.  I made the terrible error of calling Ben after power drinking for 13 hours.  Dude.  Dude.  I got to tell you.  Dude.  Dude.  I'm hearing nothing but awful, horrible, impending news that is just panic.  Pete Panic.  National Guard.  All herky jerking around with bad information.  Uh-oh.  We're getting a wrap it up. 
[00:47:00]  Really?  We're getting a move on signal.  Oh, yeah.  Move on.  Oh.  Drive pad.  We're just talking about Ben and how dramatic he is.  John, he sure is svelte.  All right.  We'll keep driving down the highway and we'll take the next exit and see what's there.  All right.  Hopefully the Billy Staples audio is ready to go next because we're running out of things.  We're doggy paddling.  Yes, we are.  We'll be at Anthony's show.  New York, Dallas, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Sacramento, San Francisco.

So throw a finger in the air.  Let me see where your rats say.  Hey.  Let me see where your rats say.  Hey.  Hey.  I'm giving it back to me.  Hey.  Hey.  Show me some math to say.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:50:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, I didn't have any rum in the house last night.  I didn't take any of that.  What was that rum?  That Malibu?  That Barry Williams, Greg Brady brought in the other day? 
[00:50:30]  And I didn't take it home with me.  I left the office.  I needed a drink so bad.  I drank Grey Goose vodka and Coke.  You ever have a vodka and Coke?  It's awful.  The Grey Goose was that, uh...  Grey Goose vodka's great, but not with Coke.  I know.  I never drink vodka and Coke, but it had that orange flavor to it.  It was an orange-flavored Grey Goose vodka and Coke.  Wasn't bad.  Took the edge off.  I'll tell you that much.  My hands were like I was shucking clams all day. 
[00:51:00]  They just had that goopy feel to them of impending doom.  It's great.  Lots going on today.  Lots of stuff we can't talk about right now.  Yeah.  I'm going to kill Rick.  We really need...  We're dying over here.  I just needed juice.  He's getting the Billy Staples audio together.  Billy Staples opened for Norton about two weeks ago now. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Bombed horribly, but I'm telling you, it wasn't really his fault.  The crowd never gave him a chance.  We finally got the audio.  We want to play it for everybody today.  So we got that going for us, which is nice.  All I kept thinking, too, was, at least I'm not Mark Parenteau.  At least I'm not Mark Parenteau.  Thank God Almighty, at least I'm not Mark Parenteau.  One of our old competitors from Boston and New York. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, he was arrested.  Last heard on Q104 and last heard on WAAF.  Yeah.  Dave Dickless actually brought him back.  That is a fact.  In Boston.  And he was arrested.  When did that happen?  Yesterday?  Yes.  Wow.  But, oh, my God, the charges.  Jiminy Cricket.  Sexual assault of a 14-year-old homeless boy. 
[00:52:30]  And he's probably like, oh, I finally made the paper.  Hey, hey.  Hey, see, I'm in the news.  Yeah, but...  Hey, wait, what?  Did you notice the story above you, Mark, once again?  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Ouch.  Once again, we trumped you.  Oh, we, pal.  We, boy, we used to butt heads with him when we were up in Boston.  And we had a segment we called, tell us your Mark Parenteau experiences. 
[00:53:00]  Remember the guy that was delivering the packages and said he worked for, like, FedEx or UPS or something?  These are all legend stories.  Allegedly, but I would assume accurate.  Who knew we'd be right six years later?  Yeah, I know.  The one I remember the most is the guy delivering the package and saying that when the door opened, it was Mark's, I guess, his live-in. 
[00:53:30]  Someone that shared the house with him.  His live-in blonde boy with the robe on.  Thank you, I'll take the package for Mark.  But he was always on the air talking about chicks.  Hey, can we find...  Hey, she's a hot one, huh?  All right, the mics are off.  Hey, intern, drop that cart and pick it up again.  Hey, hey, I'm the rear admiral.  He'd call himself the rear admiral.  Hey, uh...  Can we find out where Rick is with this tape? 
[00:54:00]  Almost done.  Okay.  We also have something that Martini Steve put together for the show today, Anthony.  Oh.  You had a pretty big rant about kids this week.  I want to separate myself from that rant.  I thought you went a little too far.  Do you?  I think you have some deep issues from your childhood.  No.  And your upbringing.  No.  My whole take is it's simple.  I, Opie, I love kids.  I love kids, too.  Can't wait to have my own someday. 
[00:54:30]  See, I was misunderstood that day.  You don't really like kids.  I was misunderstood.  And you don't want any kids.  I like kids.  You misunderstand me.  I like kids.  I like well-behaved children that aren't mine.  And I don't want to have kids because I like the spontaneity of my life.  And I like the freedom to just flee the area if I want to or need to at any given moment.  And kids don't allow you that. 
[00:55:00]  That's all.  That's all I was saying.  Did it come out harsh?  Ah.  Martini, Steve.  And he's got a tray of martinis.  He knows his dog needs martinis.  All right, Steve.  Thank you, Steve.  He's sharing.  Look at you with that tray of martinis.  Oh, don't.  Easy.  It's right up to the tippy top, that one.  Whoa.  Hey, ho.  What's up, Steve?  Oh, that's a dry martini.  Enough olives for everyone.  That's great. 
[00:55:30]  Hey, Steve, you noticed that they couldn't really pan the website last night?  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah, I noticed that.  I was kind of happy.  I was thrilled.  I saw the clip on.  I think we can just say.  I won't say anything.  I won't say anything.  I think we can just say, notice they couldn't really pan too much around your website last night.  I saw a banner ad on your website for a girl that I discovered a while back.  That's right.  Tawny Stone.  Excellent discovery, by the way. 
[00:56:00]  Tawny Stone.  Have you heard about this chick on the web?  I heard you talking about it.  Tawny Stone.  19 years old.  Don't know really from what state she originates.  I don't know.  She looks like one of those Midwestern girls or something.  And she's 19, and it doesn't look like she's changed in the past couple of years, let's just say.  Yeah, a little bit of stunted growth.  Yeah.  And quite provocative pictures, indeed.  And she looks like the all-American girl.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  And I was checking out some of the free porno sites that are afforded.  It's amazing.  You go to some of these sites, and they're completely free.  Yeah.  Completely free.  Yeah.  You download, you can see thumbnails, and then you click on them, and they are full-size pictures.  And this girl, Tawny Stone, was on there.  And I noticed the banner ad when I somehow saw your web page somewhere.  Yeah.  And I looked and went, oh, my God, there's a porno ad.  I just thought it was weird that I was looking at your website, and I didn't even have my computer on it. 
[00:57:00]  How did that happen?  I was on my computer, and I'm looking, going, look, I'm multitasking.  Yeah.  Hey.  That was one of the ads that popped up.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  Then we'll play this kid thing that Steve put together.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was on Morpheus downloading stuff to you.  Yeah.  And when did last time you had Paul Pauly Shore on?  You brought up Mark Parenteau.  Really?  You guys were talking to him, and listen to this clip I downloaded, if you can hear it.  Okay.  All right. 
[00:57:30]  This might be.  Yeah, when he told the whole town, the mayor, it's on.  So what happened to Parenteau?  Hey, Mark Parenteau.  Yeah, the rear admiral.  He was up against us at Q104, and we kicked his ass.  So that's what it was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you guys are all from Boston, though?  No, we're from New York.  We went up there for a job.  No, falling asleep again, listening to Paul Pauly Shore.  Well, I got fired.  And where is he now?  Mark?  I don't know.  Probably with a young boy. 
[00:58:00]  Oh!  Look at that.  I'm like Kreskin.  How do you like that?  I'm like Kreskin.  Wow.  I said, probably with a young boy.  And lo and behold, I know that's not a stretch.  That isn't a stretch.  Where's Ben?  With a drink.  You know?  It's really not a stretch.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  How do you like that little thing?  That's pretty good.  Very good.  That was a few years ago, too.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Good call, Angel.  I'm predicting the future. 
[00:58:30]  Not bad.  All right.  So you went off on this rant about kids, Anthony.  Yeah.  And Martini Steve took your little audio.  Very good, Martini Steve.  Disgraceful, by the way.  Disgraceful.  Thank you, Jim.  This is disgraceful.  Not me who's singing this stuff.  I know.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you're separating yourself as well?  I certainly am.  Yeah, Anthony.  Anthony, we're disgusted with you today.  Yeah.  Good, good.  You're a shameful man.  Please be disgusted with me.  There's one pause in there.  I just, I won't say a word. 
[00:59:00]  You'll know where it's the pause.  Well, let's take a listen.  Hey.  Okay.  Good.  Good.  The other one.  Good.  Disgusted with me.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Let those without sin cast the first stone, let me say.  We're head.  I don't know nothing.  I don't know.  Not disgusted with me.  Oh.  I'm holding.  There's nothing on that cart.  What happened?  Martini, Steve.  Uh-oh.  Have you been drinking martinis made with the head cleaner for the cart machines again? 
[00:59:30]  One of the, one of the joys of working in a place with ancient technology is the fact  that every once in a while, one of the carts does not record, despite the fact that you  swear to God that you've recorded it.  Yeah, sure it is.  There he goes.  Yeah.  Oh.  He just threw the cart.  He's got quite a temper on him.  Oh, my God.  He's really pissed off.  And he still didn't spill a drop.  I know.  He threw the cart and the, uh, well, the martini waved a little in that big glass.  And then he daintily licked the side of the glass with that little, little drop of martini 
[01:00:00]  spilled out.  He's so deftly licked.  Hey, Rick, are we ready?  Uh, are we ready?  We're inching, uh, closer and closer.  There's a lot of curses.  I know that.  He was just, it's brutal.  So, we're trying to clean up.  Well, we know that.  Just to make sure there are no dumps whatsoever.  So, probably in the next five, ten minutes, it'll be done.  Is that, uh, yeah.  Oh, he totally got you, dude.  I don't care what you say. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, Fred.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, Fred.  What's up, Fred?  I'm going to tell you a few things.  You want to tell us a few things?  Yeah, first of all, Pat, Pat, tell him what I'm doing to play.  He has a long hair now.  Long brown hair.  Look, man, I only got a couple hours sleep.  I can't deal with that.  Yeah.  What was he, what was he even trying to talk about? 
[01:01:00]  It was Pat Benatar, and then he's, you know, hey.  You heard Pat Benatar in there?  I certainly did.  Oh, Pat Benatar has long brown hair.  Yeah.  Oh, now I understand.  Yes, yes.  Great.  Wow, that's what we need for today's show.  Yes.  A Pat Benatar hair update.  Jesus.  Come on.  Is Brian Regan still coming in today?  Brian Regan?  He was supposed to.  Yeah, he was supposed to.  No?  Yes.  He's coming in today?  I think he's supposed to slide in for a little bit. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  At what time?  Like around now.  Around now.  Good.  I didn't know that.  Really?  You sure he wants to be seen with us today?  Oh, no.  I'm the nice guy.  I'm the nice guy.  What about our other guest that was supposed to come in?  What about our other guest?  What about our other guest that was supposed to come in today?  Tracy is still very sick from yesterday.  No, not Tracy.  Our other guest.  And A.C.  A.M.  Hall is also sick. 
[01:02:00]  Ah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, boy.  A stomach ailment of some sort.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Anthony Michael Hall is backed out of the Opie and Anthony appearance.  Oh, annoying.  It has begun.  Backed out.  The backlash.  It has begun.  Said something about a sickness.  Separate yourselves.  You got a show on such a hot network coming up.  You'd hate to alienate everybody.  Ah, boy. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Wheelchair friend, what's up?  I know I have to be disconnected before.  Oh, we got disconnected?  So what were you saying?  Hey, can we go to the F.U. line, maybe?  There might be something.  Well, maybe there's nothing there.  Oh, Steve, you got the bit? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, there it is.  Oh, thank you, Steve.  We'll go to this again.  MS.  Ah, there you go.  That's a good one from Donella in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Hey, you see?  F and die, bitch.  Thank you, Opie.  We're not even on in North Carolina.  I know.  So who am I yelling to?  You're absolutely right. 
[01:03:30]  So don't.  Don't what?  I don't know.  Listen.  I wish, I wish so much I could use the C word.  Cervical cancer.  The one that goes C-U, right?  And then there's another letter, right?  And then it ends with a T.  Mm-hmm.  That one.  That word.  Cult.  Oh.  I lunged for the button.  Cult.  Yes.  No, I didn't mean that.  What's her problem?  She doesn't even listen to our show. 
[01:04:00]  Exactly.  She's just assuming everything she heard.  Making all kinds of assumptions.  She's a fat housewife.  You shouldn't assume too much, pig.  You pig.  You pig from Charlotte, North Carolina.  Go F your father, pig.  I don't care.  What's the...  I'm not talking to you, Fred.  I'm not talking to you.  That would be an option.  Oh.  Fred, what's wrong with your phone today, Fred? 
[01:04:30]  I don't know.  I don't care, but I think it's your phone.  It can't be our phone.  We're here, and you're right over there, and...  We're over here.  And you're not there anymore.  Anthony, we got the kids thing.  This is the kids rant.  Oh, oh.  So, Marcini Steve made a little bit.  You love your kids, but sometimes they can be a handful.  Kids are great when they're other people.  Who can you trust when it comes to your young'uns?  You change them.  You wash them.  You bathe them.  Anthony's daycare oasis is a paradise. 
[01:05:00]  You're in prison.  You're in baby goddamn prison.  Filled with joy.  We don't think they're cute.  Tenderness.  We think they're annoying.  And most of all, Anthony's love.  I can only hope your child turns up like little Adam Walsh without his head.  Parents adore our staff.  These guys hate kids.  And our facilities are safe.  I have burning cauldrons of wax just sitting around for aesthetics.  Just listen to these happy children frolic through Anthony's daycare oasis.  I hate your kid. 
[01:05:30]  And I wish him dead.  Just take it from Anthony himself.  Grab your little friggin' rat and say...  We love you, Anthony.  Ugh.  That was a little harsh.  What a disgrace.  You're awful.  I was taken out of context.  Martini Steve.  That little pause without his head.  I was taken out of context.  You're awful.  By Martini Steve.  You're awful.  You're awful.  I swear I was.  When we get back, finally, the Billy Staples audio, okay? 
[01:06:00]  Right.  Of him bombing when he warmed up for Jim Norton a couple weeks ago at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  This is an F.U. for Helen, the nastiest thing I know.  For your birthday, I hope that already way-too-fat ass of yours gets even fatter, and that you die in a fire that could have easily been avoided.  F.S.  F.U., Helen. 
[01:06:30]  Next message.  Yo, 18-year-old brain's Amy.  Your boyfriend's me for a month, and you call me after he comes crawling back to you like you're the f***ing dick there.  Well, congratulations on winning your scumbag cheating boyfriend back, you f***ing moron.  Don't forget to buy a bottle of Viagrafe.  Stop a f***ing boyfriend.  Next message.  I want to give a big F.U. to Jason Priestley and the rest of all these high-tech Hollywood numbskulls that think just because they make a fortune in their big stars that they're immortal.  Two words for you, Priestley. 
[01:07:00]  Mary Busey.  Two more words for you.  Christopher Reeve.  How about some initials?  JFK Jr.  John Travolta.  You're next.  Antonio Sabato Jr.  God willing, you're next, too.  F.U.  End of messages.  Hi.  Welcome to Opie and Anthony Berger.  Sir, can I interest you on our number four special today?  Oh, great.  I need number four, please supersize, the Greco-Roman size.  Number four, Greco-Roman size.  Anything to drink with that, sir?  I need a big Coke. 
[01:07:30]  Give me one big Coke.  Okay, sir.  Anything else?  Give me the curly shoes to go with my curly fries.  Okay, that's number four, supersize, the Greco-Roman size, big Coke, and some curly shoes to go with your curly fries.  Uh, sir, if this is, if this is correct, please spit into the microphone.  Ah!  Oh!  Thank you.  Please drive up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, it's Roadrunner.  Oh, yeah.  You cannot have slow internet service in this day and age.

It's not so bad I'm asking for. 
[01:09:00]  It makes me want to go away.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where do we go?  I'm sorry.  You know, I'm not the only one.  Where do we go from here? 
[01:09:30]  You know, I'm not the only one.  Where do we go?  You're checking out the lame version of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  We're as frustrated as you, trust me.  It'll all make sense eventually.  Eventually, yeah, there's stuff we'd love to talk about.  But, uh, we've been shut down.  We might have to just skip on out of here.  It's getting ridiculous. 
[01:10:00]  We've got to make sure all our people are safe.  Very, very important.  Yes.  Not all are safe.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City.  877.  Nah, that's another number.  866.  How's that one?  Okay. 
[01:10:30]  866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  We're still waiting for the Billy Staples tape.  People think we're going to make it the 520-bit.  No.  No, no.  Believe me, we need it now.  Rick, uh, we go, Rick, how much longer?  He goes, uh, we're almost there.  What does that mean?  Almost there.  That doesn't help us.  We need it now.  And if we can't have it now...  We needed it an hour ago.  Then we've got to find something else.  We don't need our listeners to tell us we're struggling today.  We need the Billy Staples thing now. 
[01:11:00]  We could do a good half hour on that.  I was under the impression we'd come in and the show would write itself today.  Write itself.  Brian Regan's here.  Hey, is Brian here?  He sure is.  Oh, no.  Hey, has he been briefed?  I was reading the paper and...  Oh, okay.  Get him in here.  Oh, okay, okay.  We could use him right away.  I can't even...  Oh, okay.  Hey, Brian.  How are you? 
[01:11:30]  How you doing, Brian?  What's going on, Brian?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  What's up?  Just hanging out.  Hanging out.  No problem.  That's okay.  Just running at full speed.  I'm just hanging out.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, you can take a seat there.  Are we almost ready with the Billy Staples thing today?  You at Caroline's?  No, he's at...  Where are you?  Governor's in Medford.  Medford?  Medford tonight, Levittown tomorrow, and then Medford Sunday.  Wow.  That's back and forth. 
[01:12:00]  I don't understand it.  Medford's great.  When it gets dark, you can see the lights of London over the horizon.  Just about at the horizon, if you look east.  It's way out there, Brian.  It's way out east on Long Island.  I will...  I look towards the horizon?  Yeah, look east.  East.  It's so far.  You see, it was kind of funny because it's so ridiculous, you can't possibly see the lights  of England.  No way.  The curvature of the earth would come into play. 
[01:12:30]  Maybe the tallest building, like Big Ben or something.  Yeah, that's the one.  Hey, have you seen Pat Banatar's haircut?  It's nice.  It's really nice.  It really is.  She did something nice with it.  Yeah.  I hear she's grown it out and it's brown now.  It's really...  She's done a good thing.  That's what I...  I think I heard that anyway.  It's a little longer these days.  Have you watched the news lately, Brian?  Uh...  No.  It looks like he's just... 
[01:13:00]  I don't know whether to go with that or not.  I'm vaguely familiar with what's going on.  Looks like they got to you, too.  I see you got the scar in your forehead as well.  They got to...  Oh, no.  They got to.  You've cut out his brain, you bloody baboons!  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why?  What's going on?  Nothing we can talk about.  No, nothing.  I just can tell by looking at you that you're hip to the story.  Yeah, I heard there was some craziness or something.  That's good craziness. 
[01:13:30]  That's as far as we'll go.  That's what Dan Rather was calling it.  There's some craziness going on in New York City.  Craziness.  Craziness, all right.  All right, well, that's good.  I guess we can't go there today.  No.  At least you were brave enough to come in today.  Hey, man, it's my pleasure.  Anthony Michael Hall decided there's better places to be today.  No, no, I want to be here.  I want to be here where the action is, where the craziness comes from.  Anthony Michael Hall got that stomach wink-wink flu all the time. 
[01:14:00]  Some kind of stomach thing.  He probably realized the network his show is on and threw up.  That's the sci-fi channel.  I was kind of digging the show.  The Dead Zone, it's like Anthony Michael Hall plays Christopher Walken's part,  and they made it into a series.  And it's pretty good.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted to just joke on it and goof on it, but I watched it, and it was pretty good.  And now I hate saying that because for some reason he's not here today.  I just wish he would have came up with a better excuse. 
[01:14:30]  Belly ache.  I got a tummy ache.  The one I used to use in school.  I used to use that one all the time.  I got a stomach ache.  You know what I told the gym teacher once?  Because I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to have these.  You ever get, like, stomach pains because of gas?  Oh, yeah.  And my mother said, oh, my mother would be like, oh, you're cramping up.  You're cramping up because of that.  I went to the gym teacher and said, I can't participate today.  I have cramps. 
[01:15:00]  And he looked at me.  He was like, he started laughing.  I go, he goes, what?  I said, I have cramps.  He goes, you can't have cramps.  He goes, only girls have cramps.  And I'm feeling this pain from the guests.  I go, no, I have cramps.  I was having my period.  And I didn't even know.  It was all right in the cotton pony.  I used to get, like, this sharp, intense pain in the right side of my rib cage. 
[01:15:30]  It lasted for about, I mean, it was over a three-year period.  Like, every two or three months, it would just come out and it would kill.  I would literally, like, fall on the floor.  With that running pain that you'd get.  It was worse than that.  It was just, like, the sharpest pain I had ever experienced.  And so it was just, like, ah, and I would, like, fall on the floor.  And my parents would go, well, it's growing pains.  Don't worry about it.  I mean, how vague of a diagnosis is growing pains?  I can't even stand up.  Don't worry about it.  It's growing pains. 
[01:16:00]  You're growing.  That's what happens when you grow.  You get pains.  Oh, I recognize that hideous scream.  Those are growing pain screams.  Your rib is growing into your lung right now at an accelerated rate.  Oh, my gosh.  You're bleeding from the mouth.  It's growing pain.  I never got it, you know, officially diagnosed.  And then they went, you know, they only lasted, like, three years.  I only had to endure it for over, like, a two or three-year period.  Three years? 
[01:16:30]  And you never went to the doctor?  No.  Because it was just growing pain.  Well, it was, like, every three or four months.  It was just, I'd just be sitting there eating fish sticks or something.  And then, you know, and then it would just kill me.  And it would last about a minute.  And then it would go away for another three months.  How many kids did your parents have?  A lot.  Eight.  Eight.  Okay.  That explains it.  Yeah.  You can't be taking every one of these kids to the doctor with every pain.  So it's like, let Brian roll around in agony on the floor.  And we'll just tell him it's growing pain.  I got dinner to make for the other seven. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  If we lose one, I'll barely even notice.  Get out of the kitchen with your growing pains.  Yeah.  I'm trying to work here.  I'm trying to make fish sticks.  It's like an army mess line.  Get out of the way.  You had to eat the fish sticks, too, huh?  Yeah.  Fridays.  Friday was fish sticks?  No.  Families with a lot of kids, fish sticks.  What about margarine and sugar sandwiches?  I had that, too.  Yeah, we've talked about that on the show.  Margarine and sugar sandwiches.  We weren't that, though.  Really?  I was so poor. 
[01:17:30]  Let me tell you a little bit about how poor I was.  My grandma convinced us that that's a nutritious lunch.  Not even butter.  Margarine.  Margarine.  She would lay out the Wonder Breads and then lop it with the margarine and then pour the  sugar on each individual sandwich.  Man.  That was lunch.  Man, that's nice.  That is a true story, yes.  Because you were poor.  Let's go to Kim.  Kim has a question for Brian Regan.  Yes, Kim?  Hi, Brian.  Hi, Kim.  I saw you at Bananas a couple weeks ago.  Okay.  And Saturday morning, I opened up my cabinet and decided to make Pop-Tart. 
[01:18:00]  No, no, no.  Oh, jeez.  Now, I found out my brand new toaster oven has a Pop-Tart setting.  Are you serious?  I swear to God, it's a Toastmaster and it has a Pop-Tart setting.  It says Pop-Tart on it?  It says Pop-Tart in that little red funky Pop-Tart logo.  Or does it say Toaster Pastry?  Yeah, right.  Because, you know, they've got to use the generic term unless it's used by...  Some companies are in cahoots, though, you know?  Absolutely.  It's like they'll have the Pop-Tart setting on it or a washing machine that'll say, put Tide here. 
[01:18:30]  And you're like, they're in cahoots with each other.  But if it just says detergent or toaster pastry, that's a whole other animal.  You wonder, like, if they had this big, giant meeting, you know, with the Pop-Tart CEOs and the toaster oven head honchos.  Hey, how about we work together?  And instead of going with the generic toaster pastry term, we write Pop-Tarts on there, we corner the market, we start making millions! 
[01:19:00]  And you could put on the instructions, put into Proctor Silex toaster oven.  We'll rule the toaster pastry and toaster oven world!  That's right.  Because they've got to get it on the other end.  Take, Brian.  Yeah, that's right.  I don't know anything about business.  Why are they going to put the Pop-Tart button on there if they're not getting a little kickback from the Pop-Tart people?  That's not a quid pro quo.  Right.  That's just quid.  There's something.  Hey, Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, Dumb. 
[01:19:30]  Hey, Dumber.  Hey, what's up?  Thank you.  How you doing, little Jimmy?  Hello, sir.  Brian, I was wondering if you like the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Yeah.  Yes, I...  We're heading down this road already?  See, this happens a little bit later.  Later.  There's a little bit of conversation.  Don't mess it around here, guys.  I get right into it.  The listeners know we're struggling today.  Sit right down and like, we can't wait for Opie and Anthony to get to this.  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm going to be talking about all the controversial stuff.  Yeah.  I'm coming after peanut butter and jelly.  I'm coming after Pop-Tarts. 
[01:20:00]  I'm coming after T-shirts.  Did anyone ever tell you you shouldn't talk about peanut butter and jelly because you might  get in trouble if you do?  Perhaps you should steer away and move on to something else.  No one ever comes to side stage as you're doing it and makes that slashing of the throat  with their finger motion.  This could be a problem.  This could be a problem if this conversation continues kind of thing.  Imagine like some...  You've never been upset because they're still making the sandwich. 
[01:20:30]  Okay, noted.  Avoid topic.  Noted.  Because I know when we talk about peanut butter and jelly, we go into those peanut butter  and jelly meetings and it gets really ugly.  They're not pretty.  And we had a whole show planned around talking about peanut butter and jelly.  And you know something?  At the last minute, they said, we can't talk about peanut butter and jelly. 
[01:21:00]  The whole thing, the whole topic was out the window?  Out the window.  We can't even talk about how maybe if they were doing a news special on peanut butter and  jelly, how they presented peanut butter and jelly.  It is such an off-limits topic, PB&Js.  So now we've got to sit and wonder.  Hey, you know what I was wondering about that topic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes they put peanut butter and jelly in the same jar. 
[01:21:30]  Have you noticed that?  Yeah.  That is like, that's nuts.  Really.  And I don't know if I'm going into like some territory where your lawyers are going to have  to get in here or not.  But is there a point to that?  I mean, I'm lazy, but I want to meet the guy who needs that.  You know, I could go for a sandwich, but I'm not going to open two jars.  I can't be opening and closing all kinds of jars, cleaning, who knows how many knives.  You know, if you're that hungry, just, you know, or lazy, put some croutons in there. 
[01:22:00]  You get the whole sandwich on one spoon.  Oh, oh, yeah.  I'm going to have a second one.  Oh, scrumptious.  That's what's the first.  Or sometimes you might want to, you know, you don't want to clean the spoon, so you put  it all in a squeeze bottle.  Munch and no cleanup.  Can life get better?  I submit that it cannot.  Come after me, lawyers. 
[01:22:30]  You're on the edge.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Hey, Dan, what's up today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm going to be taking a car trip with my family pretty soon.  I was wondering, Brian, do you have any stories about that?  Yeah, as a matter of fact.  You do?  Yeah.  My family, we got together, and my parents gave us some peanut butter and jelly in the  same jar.  In the back of the car.  No, no, no.  That never happened. 
[01:23:00]  No, no, no.  Well, we'll get into that in a moment.  Of course.  Don't worry about it.  Right now, we have to get Pete Johnson, our engineer, because my mic just fell.  I hope this isn't a sign.  It just might be.  Yeah.  Oh, that's broken.  Oh, Rick, you can't fix it.  Your people just use duct tape.  I've seen your cars.  I broke it.  You broke it.  Oh, that fitting is broke.  That little piece.  Yeah.  Oh, this mic is effed. 
[01:23:30]  Well, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  I'll leave it hanging there for a moment.  We have the Billy Staples audio.  It's ready to go.  It's right to my left.  We're going to play it next, okay?  And Brian Regan's going to help us out with that.  You have it?  Yeah.  Finally.  Oh, great, because Brian Regan, obviously, a very popular stand-up comic.  And I want to ask you, have you ever bombed?  Yes.  You have?  Yes.  I bombed.  It was a second show Friday in 1987.  It was horrible.  You remember it.  You've never bombed, have you? 
[01:24:00]  I bombed last night.  What are you talking about?  No way.  You bomb all the time.  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, is that relative, though?  You're like, yeah, I bombed.  Like there was one person in the back that was just kind of...  No.  They weren't crying with laughter.  I mean, you get to where you can kind of fake it, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  But you know.  You know in your heart you're bombing, you know?  Really?  You know.  But usually, like in a comedy club environment, it's pretty cool.  But every once in a while, you'll get in a situation where...  I can't see you bombing. 
[01:24:30]  Ah, well...  I can't see...  Hey, I'm bombing.  Follow me around.  Hey, I'm bombing.  That happens sometimes, man.  No?  It's horrible.  Oh, Pete Johnson.  You know, I'll tell you, I was doing a corporate show, and I literally...  I'm Pete.  Brian Regan's talking.  That's all right.  I was doing a corporate show, and I literally heard...  I did a joke.  It got no laughs, and it was in the Pacific Northwest.  It was like off an island off of Seattle.  Joke got nothing.  I literally heard crickets outside, like... 
[01:25:00]  Oh, out of the woods.  And I just started laughing, you know, because I was like, oh, man, I've heard about hearing crickets.  I've never actually, actually heard the crickets.  And then the audience laughed because they could hear the crickets, too, and they sort of were on my side  for, like, the next few moments until the next joke.  Where'd you get a corporate gig at Microsoft?  That's pretty nice.  Yeah, that was...  It was Microsoft?  Yeah.  Some division of Microsoft or some damn thing.  That's all that's going on out there.  Why else are they...  What other corporation? 
[01:25:30]  Hey, we're beavers, and we love Brian Regan out on this little island off in the Pacific Northwest.  It's Microsoft or beavers.  I don't know why I don't want to say the company news.  I don't want to say it, but it's on a small island.  It's Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies.  It has a volcano.  I didn't want to say Seattle.  In the Pacific Northwest.  Pacific Northwest.  A small island in the Pacific Northwest.  I'm plotting with maps.  I got charts over here to try to figure out where Brian was. 
[01:26:00]  Where in the world is Brian Regan?  All right, and when we get back, we got the Billy Staples audio.  Finally.  Billy bombed really bad, and we'll get Brian's opinion on the whole thing.  I'm sure he did good, man.  I'm sure he did fine.  Even you cannot talk this thing nice.  Brian, it's been a soap opera for the last two weeks.  The guy has not come back to work since.  He has left the state.  He's left the state.  He's left the signal. 
[01:26:30]  He's embarrassed to come back to the station.  He has left the broadcast area of this station, so he won't inadvertently hear people making fun of him.  Maybe he's in the Pacific Northwest.  Maybe he's doing gigs.  Maybe he's doing gigs.  Some island doing gigs.  Picture Brian swimming up in a scuba suit.  Da-na, da-na, da-na, da-na, da-na, da-na, da-na.  It's the only way to get there.  Cue.  Brian Regan playing Governors. 
[01:27:00]  Medford tonight.  Levittown Saturday and Medford on Sunday.  Very funny guy.  And one of our pals.  He wasn't scared to come in today, Anthony.  That's right.  Or maybe he doesn't know what's going on yet.  Right when the mic's gone.  Hey, what happened?  Oh, I can't be here anymore.  Oh, okay.  Got to go.  Hobi and Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big.  Goddamn.  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, said, then you can pull out your business. 
[01:27:30]  It's junk.  We're artists.  You present it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you would do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags.  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on the parents, none on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:28:00]  None on us.  And then you say it like this.  Hey, Bud Light.  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  It's going to start that party.  That's what starts your party.  Keeps your summer parties moving.  Where it's hot, Bud Light's there.  That's right.  As my mic is precariously perched right here, ready to fall on my head, I need a Bud Light.  I need a Bud Light to get through this day.  Pete's on standby with a new microphone, though, Anthony. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Be refreshed with Bud Light.  Where are you going?  In the Hamptons?  Maybe the Jersey Shore?  You got that ice cold Bud Light in the cooler with you?  Don't you?  Yes, you do.  You dig through.  You pull it out.  Maybe you're grilling in your backyard.  Nothing goes better with a huge steak than an icy cold Bud Light.  You smell the chicken wings?  Smell them.  Chicken wings on the barbecue.  Probably the best smell ever.  And it goes much better with what?  Yes, icy cold Bud Light.  Next time you're out, ask for one Bud Light. 
[01:29:00]  Where is your seven?  The Open Energy Show.  WNEW.  We're coming down the mountain.  I'm going to come and see you tonight.  I'm going to come and see you tonight. 
[01:29:30]  You're checking out the Open Energy Show.  Brian Regan in studio.  Oh, yeah.  Playing Governors.  Now, Governors has two locations. 
[01:30:00]  He's playing the Medford Governors tonight.  Tomorrow night, he'll be in Levittown at that Governors.  On Sunday, he'll be back in Medford.  Right, Brian?  That's right.  Wow.  Right on the money.  You're making a Governor's sandwich right there.  That's right.  A little confusing, but I think the Brian Regan fans will figure it out.  Very funny guy.  We love Brian Regan.  Oh, yeah.  He has decided to stay, Anthony.  That's very nice of him.  Hey, man.  Mighty white of him.  My pleasure.  Sorry, LB.  I was distracted reading. 
[01:30:30]  Just reading things that are being printed out from various newspapers.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I told you.  Isn't there something going on with the economy?  Yeah, there's buying and selling.  Yeah, I heard like the stock market is very volatile.  It's not the only thing.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  You're never going to believe what WCBS 2 just teased for their 5 o'clock news. 
[01:31:00]  I knew it.  I knew they were going after the stock market.  What?  What?  Is it up or down?  No, Brian.  It's a story about peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Ah.  Peanut butter and jelly.  Yeah.  All right.  It looks like it would be a pretty juicy story.  Right off the top.  Thank you, Frank.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Well, we have the Billy Staples audio, Anthony.  Peanut butter and jelly.  I think we need to move on from peanut butter and jelly.  Yeah.  I don't have to say that, but.  Covered the topic.  It's a sticky situation. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  Oh.  That's whack hat.  Yes, Brian.  It's going to be one of those shows.  You don't have to ask.  Just hang in there with us.  Everyone knows you're funny already.  All right.  This is fun, man.  I'm just, like, enjoying it.  It's like watching a circus, man.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Did you see Pete Johnson come running in like an indie pit man  and fix my mic?  Yes.  That guy is a professional,  and we're all going to miss him when he retires  in 11 months or whatever the hell it is. 
[01:32:00]  Ten and a half months.  Ten and a half months.  He's counting the days now.  He's counting the days.  He just 40, how many years?  44, he said.  44 years of working at this station  and it just being the smoothest sailing ever.  All he had to hear was,  Hey, my microphone's a little tinny.  Okay, Scott, so I'll fix it.  Nothing like that.  Now there's staining of carpets.  By couples.  He replaced the carpet yesterday.  He replaced the square of carpet. 
[01:32:30]  He should have had to do that.  That we had.  I know.  Why did he have to do it?  He just decided he didn't want to look at it anymore.  You notice the brand new carpet in here, Brian?  Yeah, it's very nice.  Nice, isn't it?  It is very nice.  Is there one tile of carpet that's a little cleaner than the rest?  No, he replaced the whole thing.  Oh, he did?  He took the one out and put the whole new one down.  It's kind of hard to just cut a square out.  Well, these are indeed two foot by two foot squares.  Oh, they are.  Wow.  Because underneath this is some hatch door system that is akin to the old Ronan Martin laughing. 
[01:33:00]  The hatches that Goldie Hawn would pop up out of and tell a joke.  There's hatches where you can get down there and get at the wires that are running all of it.  This is a floating studio.  They call it a floating studio.  So we had a couple have sex right in the corner there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  To christen the new rug, Brian.  Sure.  You get a new rug, you've got to do something like that.  And there was...  You have to look at it and enjoy it.  There was stuff that remained after they left, let's just say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone dropped a cornflake on the rug.  Yeah, that's...  We taped off the area, and then somebody put a couple of napkins over the fence, and it 
[01:33:30]  sat there for a day and a half until Pete Johnson, sick of looking at it, put a new piece of  carpeting down.  He is quite a professional, but he's never had to deal with stuff that he has to deal with  with this show.  Correct.  Ah, good for him.  All right, finally, Anthony, the Billy Staples audio that everyone's been waiting for.  Once again, Jim Norton invited Billy Staples to warm him up, what, two weeks ago at Red 
[01:34:00]  Bank.  Wasn't it at Billy's prompting, though?  Didn't Billy say...  Yeah, but he didn't...  He's not begging, but he brought it up.  Yeah, kind of like joking, because Ron and Fred were going to help promo the gig.  So he's like, hey, maybe you can put me on.  And I'm like, yeah, you know what?  Yeah, okay.  Cool.  And so I was happy to have him.  With that smile all the time.  Yeah, maybe you can put me on.  All right.  Okay.  And he hasn't been seen since.  He finally called Ron and Fez last night.  Oh, he wasn't a happy Billy.  Yeah, hi, how you doing? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  It was, well, I don't know what to do.  I'm very depressed.  I bombed.  I had a horrible time.  And as my life...  He goes, Ron, my life isn't falling apart.  My life fell apart.  And he goes, the only thing I have left is this dream of being on the stage and being  a comic and I've been doing stand-up for nine years and I cannot now get back on the stage.  He goes, how do you recover from something like this? 
[01:35:00]  Just get back on.  I know.  He was crying.  It was disgusting.  I mean, I understand he's hurt, but you've got to go back on.  Like a horse.  And then just going, oh, stop it already.  Stop your whining.  Exactly, like a horse.  If you do something...  If I have a horse, you run after the horse, you punch it, and you get back on.  Right.  Right.  Or if a horse gags you, you've got to just spit it out and keep going.  If a horse or a mule kicks you in the face, you kick it back.  Right.  Here was Ron's reaction, though, to Billy crying last night. 
[01:35:30]  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  You smack him in the face.  It was great.  But I've got to say, it's not Billy's fault.  It's not.  He thinks they all booed because of his act.  He never got a chance, Brian, to do his act.  It was that...  The crowd was that hostile.  Maybe it sounded like boo, but it was Billy Staples.  Oh, no.  Billy Staples.  There was an A-hole chant.  Oh.  There was a... 
[01:36:00]  No, no, no.  That's Staples.  Staples.  See?  You've got to look at it like riding a bike.  You know, if a girl gets off, you smell the seat while she runs into the store.  There, see?  You've got to apply a philosophy like that.  I don't think there's a positive spin on get off the stage, you fat...  It's really not.  Now, we've got the audio.  Billy comes in crystal clear.  You can't really hear the crowd.  Well, we boosted it a little bit, right, Rick?  How'd that work out?  We were hard at work.  We double-layered it.  We tried to boost the crowd and bring up Billy and kind of match it as best we could. 
[01:36:30]  There's going to be a bit of a hiss, but that's just the hiss from the VCR.  I hate the hiss.  I hate the hiss.  God forbid that when they record it, and you're paying to have it recorded from the actual venue,  that it should sound properly.  Who would want the audience mic for a live recording?  And part of the problem, too, is that when he starts screaming into the mic, it...  Oh, yeah.  It freaks the mic out because he just starts...  Regardless if you could hear the crowd or not, the most important thing, listen to the desperation in his voice.  Listen to how distracted he is and how he cannot even get words out 
[01:37:00]  because he is so preoccupied with the crowd heckling him.  Well, but first, on the phone, we've got Ron from Ron and Fez.  Ron.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Ron.  Ron.  Ron.  Yeah.  You'll still hang out with us, right?  Kind of.  Kind of.  Ken and I are both waiting to see what the lawyers say.  Right.  And then we'll have an opinion.  Very good.  Very good strategy.  We're using that one. 
[01:37:30]  You know, I said to Ken and Jeremy, geez, what do you think of this?  Well, that's it, huh?  Maybe it's time for Ron and Fez to be on three shifts a day.  Just turned into the Ron and Fez station at this point.  I'm like, hey, I noticed those replays are trending up.  Oh, that's great.  Ron, we finally got the audio.  Billy Staples, of course, we're going to leave it for you guys tonight.  I don't even know if it should be played.  Why?  You know what kind of shape he's in. 
[01:38:00]  He's suicidal.  Let me tell you something.  I listened to your show when you talked to Billy on the phone.  I wanted to reach through and smack him.  I wanted to smack him in the face.  He was just the most whining.  Yeah, he's pathetic.  He really is.  When he said, my life isn't falling apart, my life fell apart.  Hey, look at that.  They're talking about peanut butter and jelly on Channel 2.  Oh, where is that?  Oh, look at that.  Hold on there, Ron.  Now there's a lot of the Rockettes there. 
[01:38:30]  Well, it's a coming attraction.  Oh, it's what they call a teaser.  They're teasing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich story on Channel 2.  All right.  Sorry, Ron.  Yeah.  Hey, if you missed that one, another one's coming on in five.  They've been on all day.  A lot of interest in peanut butter and jelly.  Yeah, it really is.  Talk about going the other extreme.  So you bring me in to do some Pop-Tart jokes.  Right, sure. 
[01:39:00]  You bring Regan in.  It's like the sunlight after a bad storm.  Right.  I don't know.  Regan is like when O.J. was hanging around with Rosie Greer the next day.  Yeah.  And everybody's like, hey, Rosie Greer's great.  So therefore, by association.  Yeah, Brian's such a nice guy.  I never even heard him use a curse word on stage.  No, he doesn't.  That's right.  He's a good boy.  Ron, at one point today, it was only raining over this building. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  No joke.  That was a little odd.  A little strange.  Ah, you never know.  All right, so why don't we get to the audio of Billy Staples, okay?  You know, but also let people know that don't know Billy, he's already been through five rehabs.  Yeah, you got a little more of a background on what his destroyed life is a little more about.  He's been through five rehabs.  And when we were talking to him last night, he's slurring.  So the newest chip is out the window, I'm sure.  Oh, and you asked him if he was doing any drinking. 
[01:40:00]  You promised you won't drink.  And he said, I can't promise anything.  What does it matter?  What does it matter?  What does it matter?  He had that whole attitude of just, oh, me, poor me.  I'm just going to cash it in.  And, you know, here's the thing, too.  His second marriage broke up, so he moved home with his mom.  And he's 44 years old, and he's sleeping in the same room as he did in high school.  So he's waking up in a single bed now, and he's looking up at these old faded Terry Bradshaw 
[01:40:30]  and Peter Frampton posters that he had there in the 70s.  This should have been part of his intro.  Right.  This would have set the plate nice for him.  You know, he's a lovable guy, but, you know, they're not called lovable clubs.  They're really not.  You know, you have to have comedy.  He's got to realize he has a good gig with your show, and he's being way too hard on himself.  Sure, he's the phone guy.  He's doing great. 
[01:41:00]  It's an entry-level position.  He's at midlife.  Dude, are you just hoping that he kills himself on your show live?  This is before the tape, please.  That's harsh.  But, I mean, so he's going through a lot.  Yeah.  And I love how everyone is saying, now, when you listen to this tape, everyone says,  oh, you know something?  You could be the funniest comic in the world and come out there, and they would have booed  anyway.  And everyone goes, yeah, yeah.  But he's not. 
[01:41:30]  He's not the funniest comic, no.  No.  I mean, you know.  I don't know.  I've never seen what he does.  I can't say he is or is.  I honestly don't know.  Where were you?  Where were you when these hijinks and shenanigans were going on?  What were you saying?  What were you and Vaughn saying to each other?  Come on.  Just kind of laughing.  How do you laugh?  I like Billy.  When you're watching one of your friends take it in the face, you have to enjoy it.  You think I'm rooting for other comics?  I want them all to go down in flames.  Yeah, that's true.  No one knew what he was doing.  You like to watch other comics, Bob, because it makes you feel better about yourself. 
[01:42:00]  Even you, Brian Regan?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's the most controversial thing I've ever heard you say.  Well, Brian's going to be commenting about Billy Staples here.  Let me rethink this.  Let me take this back.  All right, Ron, you want to stay on the phone for the playing of the date?  Sure.  And after that, we'll listen to my sister get raped.  Oh, man.  All right, let's start the date.  All right.  Pleasure bringing up our next act. 
[01:42:30]  You're going to love this guy.  He's a good friend of mine.  He's been on Comedy Central.  He's been on MTV.  He's a regular Ron and Fez.  Billy Staples, a big hit.  All right.  What the f*** were you expecting, Fabio?  All right, so he starts out. 
[01:43:00]  Now, they seem to be applauding, though, when he came out.  I heard, like, applause, and then I heard a slow turn to booze.  There's a little, low boo rumbling.  Yeah, a little, low boo.  But there was, like, yay.  I think William didn't take charge immediately.  You can't.  I told you that Bill Maher story in Phoenix.  Open him for dice.  You can't sometimes stand there and just go, ahem, all right.  If you hear them applauding and then this low murmur of booze,  you've got to get right to the mic and start rapping. 
[01:43:30]  This is not the L.A. Improv on a Saturday evening.  I mean, these are a bunch of drunken pigs.  You know, I'm not on the road anymore.  Is the Fabio stuff still current for us?  I've been opening with it, but I get to it quicker.  Yeah.  Fabio.  Yes.  See, that might have been a problem right off the bat.  What are you expecting, Rock Hudson?  I mean, I look like Frankie Lyman.  But, you know, it's not a bad joke.  It just didn't fly.  Yeah.  He attacked right away, though. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  He attacked the crowd right away.  Yeah, implying they were expecting something.  All right, back to the tape.  Jesus Christ.  That's why I'm at f***ing radio.  Uh-oh.  I'm in the f***ing dark yelling at me.  I'm sure what the hell f***ing good you look over there.  I think he got a good applause, though.  You've got to laugh.  It seemed like he struck back at one of the hecklers.  Unfortunately, there were about 499 more. 
[01:44:30]  And you shouldn't agree with them.  You know, what the heck?  What do you think I'm on radio for?  Of course, look at me.  You can trip.  You can rip yourself.  But you've got to, pow!  You smack the guy in the face and then trash yourself.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't give in like, you know, I'm not knocking him.  He hasn't been on stage much because he's doing radio.  Like, boo!  Because they were yelling.  What you couldn't hear was, you fat F.  He was wearing the big orange shirt, so people were yelling, you look like an effing pumpkin.  And they were really being brutal.  So then he did a little of that self-deprecating humor.  Well, what does Brian think so far?  You know, he got heckled. 
[01:45:00]  He came back.  You know, he's trying to get control.  You know, he's doing his thing.  Right?  You are good.  They send you to the Middle East.  Well, hey, why don't you Jews get along with the Palestinians?  Actually, we should send them down the hall.  Palestinian even starts with pal.  So why don't you just be their pal?  And Israel starts with is.  Pal is.  We could is be pal.  Is be our pal. 
[01:45:30]  All right, back to Billy.  There it is.  Wow.  Hey, you guys got paintball guns?  Thank you.  F*** it, then.  I'm staying up here.  Hey, guys, welcome.  Come on, seriously.  Welcome to the f***ing Red Bank.  A town that's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons on the shore.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.  It sounded like they were starting to laugh, and then you guys cut it. 
[01:46:00]  It was a laugh.  I like the local stuff.  He's done a lot of local stuff.  Yeah.  He's relating.  Some local color.  I like.  That was the first of the seriously.  That was the first of the seriously.  When he says seriously, he's pleading, oh, please let me just start my act.  All kidding aside, guys.  Yeah, all kidding.  All right, I know you're heckling and yelling, and we've been having a good time.  But now we've got to get down to brass tacks.  I'm down with that jockey.  Settle down. 
[01:46:30]  Settle down.  Let's go back.  Brian thinks he might have got a laugh.  Well, it sounded like they were starting to laugh at the joke there.  Hey, guys, welcome.  Come on, seriously.  Welcome to the f***ing Red Bank.  A town that's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons on the shore.  A little bit.  And a huge, huge sock.  A huge sock.  Now, here we go.  But that's one guy yelling that while the rest is laughing.  I did hear a few laughs and one really loud.  You suck.  I'm going to be brutally honest right here now.  I'm going to be brutally honest.  Here's what happened. 
[01:47:00]  He says that people were yelling right when he came out.  He's right.  They were.  That was his chance right there.  You heard when he goes, welcome to Red Bank.  Seriously, welcome to Red Bank.  There was not a peep.  There wasn't a peep.  That was his shot now to win the audience over with a huge opener.  It absolutely was.  If we could again, perhaps.  All right.  They shut up for him when he said, seriously.  Keep talking.  I've got to go.  All right.  The old-fashioned way.  Keep talking?  We can't talk about things. 
[01:47:30]  Maybe the choice of tampon didn't work out for him.  Yeah, maybe that.  Maybe tampooning might have helped a little bit.  I think Brian enjoys a bloody tampon joke every once in a while, right?  You never know.  Everyone has their different style.  Yeah.  He's got a style.  You pull that out in the third set, right?  Yeah, that's late night stuff.  That's Reggie Bills' material.  All right.  You want to hear this again?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Hey, guys.  Welcome.  Come on.  Seriously.  Welcome to the f***ing Red Bank.  A town that's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons on the shore. 
[01:48:00]  That's got a laugh, too.  That's got a laugh.  That's what I'm saying.  It's got a laugh.  That's a lot of heckling.  All right.  All right.  We heard you, you stupid f***er.  Not really.  See, that actually got a nice laugh.  There was one really loud heckler, but you've got to smash that guy really hard.  That's the thing.  He's got enough of a base where if he can shut the one guy down.  Right.  He had it right there.  That was his moment.  He got a little bit of a laugh.  He should have smacked the guy in the face and then, boom, right again with some strong stuff. 
[01:48:30]  You've got to hit a guy like that.  I think he was thinking more of a shotgun blast at the audience than that laser comeback line.  Oh, is that it?  He was going to take everybody down.  The shotgun blast.  It's kind of hard to get them all back if you shut them all down.  But a guy like that, man, you've got to hit him.  He's like, hey, why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?  Hey, yeah, you.  That's the crowd laughing.  A lot of people checking in that were there, Anthony.  I like that one. 
[01:49:00]  Saying that the tape is not doing the performance justice.  Because everyone is saying people were screaming and yelling and heckling the whole time.  And you could barely even hear him.  Well, the fact that Marlee Maitland did the audio on this, I would like to smash this company.  Yeah, the crowd wasn't mic'd, obviously.  Why would you on a live performance?  Who needs the crowd?  So just keep that in mind.  I mean, they were just riding him really hard.  It's a lot louder than it sounds in the state.  So when it's silent, there were people screaming.  Yeah.  Imagine what it sounded like in his head. 
[01:49:30]  All the demons screaming at him.  Booze, pills, and the audience.  He's adding to the chorus.  In his defense, he had that stomach stapling thing, and it didn't take.  It didn't take.  I mean, that's rough to deal with.  They don't take or not take?  Well, he's gained weight since his stomach has been stapled.  He's popped a few staples.  How do you break that to a patient?  The stapling didn't take.  Sorry, your stapling didn't quite take.  These might just be growing pains. 
[01:50:00]  That's a callback.  Yeah, go on, yeah.  Billy just didn't hit them hard enough, man.  Maybe they made the staples out of pure butter.  Is that it?  That ties in with the Fabio.  I can't believe it's not butter.  See, this is the kind of stuff he needs.  If a guy heckles you like that, you've got to say to the crowd,  hey, wouldn't you like him to shut the heck up?  You know, I'll clap and get on your side.  Back to the tape.  All right.  Some of you may be saying to yourselves,  why the f*** you got a name like Staples? 
[01:50:30]  Because I had that staples surgery, right?  The stomach stapling?  Doing a great job, huh?  You guys are so f***ing kind.  Come on.  Shut the f*** up and let me do the act.  Okay.  Oh, that's right.  Even Brian.  Even Brian.  That's what got Brian.  That's hard.  That's a hard moment.  That's a hard moment there.  That's a hard moment.  Let me do the act. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, my God.  I know the feeling, though, man.  That was so bad.  You know the feeling, but that's the worst thing you could say.  They're not going to just sit there and go,  oh, he makes a good point.  Okay.  That's the Jake LaMotta moment.  Hey, don't bother me, pal.  I'm trying to do my routine.  Don't bother me, pal.  It's more like he thought he was going to be the prom queen  and the blood started pouring down.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  You see Brian's face?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Brian was pained.  Oh, okay.  So listen to that.  Brian made the same face I saw Ken Stevens make eight times today 
[01:51:30]  at different phone calls.  Okay.  Let's hear more of the Billy Staples.  Hey, boss ain't coming back, you b***h.  He's already halfway on the b***h turnpike getting out of here.  All right.  Listen up. 
[01:52:00]  Seriously, listen to me for a second.  Well, you guys, you guys listen to ONA, of course.  When I was on ONA, I had a colonoscopy done on the air.  Any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  Any of you guys had a colonoscopy?  How about can any of you guys spell it?  This is not men that you're talking to.  They're retard, drunken lunatics.  Brian, not smart to ask the audience questions?  No, not in that particular situation. 
[01:52:30]  Not when they're that hostile.  And the question that he asked, hey, anyone colonoscopy?  Seriously, guys, 17% across the board tax or what?  All right, well, this is great.  He takes out the Q&A now.  We get rid of the Q&A.  This is helpful.  This is working out.  It really is.  That was another very uncomfortable moment.  This just in.  Looks like Channel 5 also likes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
[01:53:00]  Boy, they are covering it.  All right.  Back to that line, Anthony.  Well, you guys, you guys listen to ONA, of course.  When I was on ONA, I had a colonoscopy done on the air.  Any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  All right, so they're yelling and screaming, whip him out.  And being kind of a large man, he decided to lift his shirt up. 
[01:53:30]  He lifted his shirt.  His man boobs.  And he got a good reaction.  That's not a ovation.  See?  See?  See, ball score.  Hey, I'll wait all night for you guys.  Get out.  Oh, go ahead.  And then, seriously, any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He went back.  Follow-up.  He went back.  He went back to the colonoscopy. 
[01:54:00]  He's on it.  He got a little off track with a whip him out.  And then, wham, back to the colonoscopy.  Back to the killer stuff.  Back to the killer stuff.  This is his stuff.  Gold, he's got a piece of gold to bring out there for him.  I can't wait now to hear the punchline.  Oh, no.  Let's give a little listen.  And you guys, oh, I'm the only one who fell for this.  Fell for it.  Fell for it.  You were diagnosed. 
[01:54:30]  You fell for it.  You're eating whole hams for 40 years.  You didn't fall for something.  He's confused.  It wasn't like a sleight of hand card trick.  Oh, I fell for the colonoscopy.  Oh, I thought that was the queen.  He was making balloon animals.  And before I knew it, he had a camera on my keister.  Maybe he better edit this out of his tape.  Yeah.  That's the only one that is full.  Oh, man.  All right.  Fell for this.  Let me tell you, a colonoscopy is a big pain in the ass. 
[01:55:00]  That was the kicker on that one?  The punchline.  The colonoscopy is a big pain.  Well, let's ask Brian.  Brian?  It sounds like he's a funny guy.  He's got some good stuff.  You know, but it doesn't matter.  If you start off on the wrong foot and the crowd ain't like,  and that's it, you're dead.  You're dead in the water.  And that's the situation he was in.  And, you know, I feel for him.  You can hear the hecklers organizing now. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, you really can.  It's more like wrestling hecklers.  Right.  They're working as a group.  Right.  Like at the conventions, you know, the delegates who want to comment on his weight.  It's like the Iron Sheik has shown up, and he's burning an American flag.  I think there's a pain in the ass line.  It's not a bad, like, aside, like, thing to say.  Throw away, right.  Yeah, a little throwaway line.  Yeah.  You don't hit that hard. 
[01:56:00]  But you can't say, like, it's hard to set that up and then go, no, no, no.  I've had the colonoscopy, and let me tell you, here it comes.  Put on your laughing hats.  Like, you don't say the serious.  Seriously.  It was a pain in the ass.  Get ready, Alice.  Here it comes.  You're setting it up a little too much.  I wouldn't send a night out on a dog like this.  Not on a dog, Alice.  Leave it there.  The cat will get it.  You have no sense of humor.  Well, Billy Staples.  There he is. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  Well, I'll tell you.  Hold on.  Let me tell you.  The worst part is the f***ing preparation.  It's just pandemonium.  F*** you all.  And right here, he should say, seriously, anyone ever have a colonoscopy? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Right there.  He's missing his mark again.  That's where it just rose up 20 notches and became that full group.  Became one entity.  Just boom.  It literally sounds like the ump just threw Bobby Valentine out of the gate.  And Shea is going crazy.  That's where you've got to look at the crowd and go, hey, my wife likes me.  Ron and Fez like me.  Go on.  Pick on me if it makes you feel better. 
[01:57:30]  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  Oh, man.  His wife doesn't like him, though.  Yes.  That's part of the sad part.  That's the sad part, right?  Hey, everyone's checking and saying the tape doesn't do it justice.  The boos were just deafening.  You could tell.  But the crowd was not mic'd, unfortunately.  You could tell at that part it was probably deafening because he can't even talk.  He's got the mic and he's just going, I've been, I can't, but the, yeah.  He told us last night he was in shock. 
[01:58:00]  He was in shock at that point?  He was in shock.  Yeah, it certainly sounded like it.  A little more?  Do we have more?  Yeah, there is a really bad a-hole chant coming up.  I don't know how much they're going to let us play, but just in case they dump out, I  just want to let you know.  It went on forever.  Did it?  All right, you guys going to shut the f*** up for two seconds or what?  Yeah, ask him a question.  Then it better be a two-second joke.  Can I share something with you guys?  Can I at least share something with you? 
[01:58:30]  They go, no.  Good tactic, good tactic.  Now it's not me telling jokes.  We're all sharing.  I'm going to give you something.  We're in this together, gang.  We're sharing.  Can I share something with you guys?  We're all of the same ilk?  All right, can I share now?  This crowd was on.  They didn't miss a beat.  They're like, no.  Another question.  You can't keep asking.  That implies that you need them for something.  You just got to smash them.  Are you guys going to let me do this?  No. 
[01:59:00]  No, that's our answer.  You ask.  Do you want to hear it?  No.  Does a rapist say, could you please undo the belt?  No.  No.  It just undoes it.  Do it.  Just do it.  Jump in.  I'm not dead.  Hey, let me share something with you guys.  Can I at least share something with you?  I just joined the 12-step recovery program.  I'm recovering anorexic.  You guys ain't going to laugh at a f***ing thing I say, are you? 
[01:59:30]  That's the big no.  They are one.  They are of one single mind.  You never want the crowd to become one.  They have united.  At the beginning, it was all different heckles.  He got this crowd to the point where they were one mind.  Oh, he's the white substitute teacher in Harlem right now.  Yes, it was...  That was a little painful, that joke, too.  A little painful.  You got to whack the crowd hard, man.  Like, if they're giving you stuff like that, you got to go, hey, I'm working. 
[02:00:00]  Do I bother you when you're working?  By going to McDonald's and knocking the mop out of your hand?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, everyone's elbowing each other.  That's the one.  Hey, now...  Hey, you know you're doing good when they start elbowing each other.  Yeah, I'm with you.  Oh, he's good.  He makes up for the fact that he has no timing and no material by acting pathetic and desperate.  Well, you got to balance.  Begging that he shares.  Can I share something?  Let me share.  Like he said it once and then realized, oh, that's a good word to turn the crowd around. 
[02:00:30]  Sharing.  Sharing is caring.  Hey, I'm looking at peanut butter and jelly on TV.  Sorry, I'm a little distracted right now.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, hey, they look familiar.  Hey, there's some good news.  Okay, that's good to hear.  Good, good, good.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  That's never good.  Oh, boy.  Brian's never good when they go to the street to ask them how they think about peanut butter and jelly.  Yeah.  Man on the street questions?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  That's not good.  Wow.  No.  Oh, gee.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, oh, there.  Okay.  They, uh, that's, uh, more stuff you can't talk about.  It looks like those two don't want to comment about peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Yeah, that's it.  And, uh, oh, well, that looks familiar.  That's a familiar place.  Mm-hmm.  I've never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in that place.  No.  Have you, Anthony?  Never.  No. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, why have they?  Oh, boy.  She looks like, uh, what was her name from Indiana Jones, the first one?  Allen?  Karen Allen?  Is that her name?  Yeah, she looks like her a little bit.  I know Brian is, uh, panicking a little bit.  We've got to get him out of here.  And he feels a little longer.  Oh, no.  I've got to get to Medford.  No, I know.  Oh.  You've got a really long ride.  That'll take a while.  Um.  Friday in LA, it's fun.  In the summer, when everyone's coming out to the hampset?  Seriously, could you guys get out of the way?  This is the best time to do it, right?  I hope you have a 30 on a Friday. 
[02:02:00]  I hope you have a helicopter.  You're not going to let me get through this traffic.  All right, why don't we say goodbye to Brian?  All right.  Well, there's still some more time on this tape.  Billy, if you're out there, hang in there, man.  I know it was a rough show.  We all have them.  You know, the crowd didn't go your way.  But, uh, you know, you're all right.  And, uh, hope to see you soon.  Get back on that horse.  Oh, that'll turn him around.  I'm trying, man.  Coming from a guy that I couldn't even imagine getting heckled at all ever on stage, Brian Reek. 
[02:02:30]  You should have seen me in the Pacific Northwest.  Oh, on that small island off the coast in the Pacific Northwest?  Somewhere.  He's the most universal comic I've ever seen.  I've seen, like, black guys and bikers.  Everybody laughs.  Whether it's some small out-of-the-way island in the Pacific Northwest or maybe somewhere near Tahiti.  Doesn't matter.  It's universal, Brian Reek.  Love having you, Brian. 
[02:03:00]  Thanks, man.  Thank you so much.  We really needed somebody in here today.  Hey, no problem.  I hope everything works out, you know?  And, Brian, I hope you can come back with me and Fez get the drive-time show.  Ron.  Yeah.  I love you, man.  I miss you.  Yeah, me too, buddy.  All right.  Ron.  We'll see you soon.  Ron.  I love you like a brother, right?  Yeah.  But you saw what happened to the last two guys that said that, all right?  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  I know.  Just keeping it real.  Hey, I figured the four of us are leaving.  Yeah.  Don't be where I feel. 
[02:03:30]  They'll throw all our asses out of here.  Who are we kidding?  Well, let's get the super agent on the phone.  What are we going to do?  That's right.  All right.  Let's say goodbye to Brian, because he really has to go.  Brian Regan's going to be at Governor's tonight in Medford.  Then Levitown.  Levitown tomorrow night.  The Governor's over there.  And then back to Medford on Sunday.  Yeah.  Right?  So, Medford tonight and Sunday.  Tomorrow, Levitown.  Yeah, but it gets confusing.  That's easy.  Tonight, Sunday, Medford.  Levitown, Saturday.  Right.  If you live in Levitown, go Saturday.  You're in Medford tonight or Sunday.  Those are your options.  That is a beautiful plug.  No.  It's not complicated. 
[02:04:00]  You just screwed it up.  No, I did.  It should be the radio ad.  You've got to take it one step at a time.  No.  Because the people that have plans tonight, they're not going to listen to tonight's plug.  So, you go Saturday, Governor's in Levitown.  Oh, Saturday, Governor's in Levitown.  Okay, I'm free.  Yeah.  I'm going there.  How about this?  Second show tonight in Medford is in Medford.  The first show Saturday in Levitown.  There's a first show tonight in Medford, and there's a Sunday show back in Medford.  But there's also a second show in Levitown tomorrow night as well.  That's clear.  The only reason Brian said that is because his shows are sold out again.  Of course.  Always. 
[02:04:30]  I don't know, man.  No, I'm just kidding.  Go see Brian Regan.  He's hilarious.  Thank you, Brian.  Thanks.  And see Norton and see Billy Staples.  Yeah.  September 7th at Westbury Music Fair.  Old Jimmy Norton.  Let's get back to the Billy Staples tape.  Will Billy be joining you on stage at Westbury?  You know what, dude?  I'm not kidding.  If Billy wanted to go on, I'm not messing with you.  I don't do that to other comics.  Dude, he's more than welcome to work with me.  I like the guy.  Yeah.  I think he's a lot funnier than people gave him credit for.  He'd have to be.  But he's more than welcome to do that, and I'm not even being polite. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  I wonder if he would.  You think he would take that, Ron?  I don't think that he even wants oxygen anymore.  Let him come out.  It's a gig, man.  And he'll have to go on stage a few more times.  Because he is a funny guy.  It's just that he hadn't been on enough right before that.  Sometimes it happens.  Well, let's get back to the tape.  We've got about two more minutes left in this thing.  All right.  Because then Rich Voss comes back out, and then Voss encourages the crowd to get Staples back.  It's getting one more shot.  It gets a little crazy still here.  Billy Staples at Red Bank.  Thank you. 
[02:05:30]  You guys ain't going to laugh at the f***ing thing I say, are you?  I could be the funniest mother f***er in the world, and you guys ain't going to laugh, are you?  You're not.  You guys really suck.  What's that?  What's that?  This is so f***ing blows.  You guys are horrible.  You guys are absolutely f***ing horrible. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  You guys want Voss back?  Fine.  You'll get f***ing Voss back.  F*** you.  And that is where he storms off the stage.  And he says that like he's punishing the audience.  All right.  You want Voss?  Fine.  You can't fire me.  I quit.  Right.  Yeah.  That's the mentality he had at that point. 
[02:06:30]  He must have been just completely in shock.  Didn't know what to do.  There was no way he could have jumped back in, so he just said, screw it.  I'm off.  Dude, in moments like that, it's tempting.  You're just trying to have that moment of clarity alone in your head where you can all  make sense of it and then get to what you do.  But when you're sick, that's why you're asking questions.  We all do that as comedians.  It's a stall tactic.  Yeah.  What do you do for a living?  And they tell you, oh, you do that as you're repeating it, you're thinking it's all trying  to get your head together.  And all right, now I can straighten this out.  And he just couldn't because there was too many and they were yelling and he was a little 
[02:07:00]  bit, you know, taken back by it.  But you don't ask them to repeat the hateful things.  No, that is something that is...  Get off!  What?  What?  Get off!  I thought that's what you said, but I wanted to clarify.  I didn't want to misquote you, sir.  When he, you hear the certain single guys, single people, not the whole group, yelling out  these heckles, when he said, I could be the funniest guy and you still wouldn't laugh.  Someone just yelled, you're not!  And you're not!  He was giving them every opportunity to hammer him. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, like, yeah, but if I suck, you'd all yell, you suck!  Yeah.  You do!  You suck!  That's what they were yelling.  Did we blow off the a-hole chant?  Uh, no.  Part two?  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's in when he returns to the stage.  So now Vos comes back to the stage, it looks like, yeah.  Part of a riot.  They're all applauding now because Billy has finally decided to leave the stage.  That's what you're hearing here, and then, uh, you know, Vos is making his way back. 
[02:08:00]  And I think Vos is looking behind him because he's never heard applause walking out before.  Wow.  Billy Staples.  You wouldn't think you'd be so happy to see Rich Foss again that quick, huh?  This just turned from the Red Bank Theater to the White Apollo.  Now he's getting some good laugh.  That's funny.  That's funny. 
[02:08:30]  Sure.  The Apollo?  Sure.  It's like following Mussolini in World War II.  Of course they're going to love you.  Yeah.  Anybody could have come out there.  Uh, yeah.  Unbelievable.  Billy, you don't want to just try a few more?  Now, Vos is an ass right here.  Yeah.  He loved it a little too much.  He was enjoying it.  He thought, I want more.  Bring him back out.  And he talks him out, uh, back out on stage.  Just making believe he cares. 
[02:09:00]  He wanted to see, uh, Billy eat it just a little more.  Do two more, f*** him.  He's going to do two.  All right.  So now, here comes Billy.  Billy decides to come back onto the stage.  You got to lose.  I've just been told they got to do another 20 minutes.  Look how quickly.  Let me ask the ladies a question here tonight.  Ladies, I want to ask you a question, and I want you to answer it as honestly and quickly as you can. 
[02:09:30]  Ladies!  Ladies, does size matter?  Holy s***, we got a lot of sluts here tonight.  See, it took a little long.  What does that mean?  Yeah.  What's that mean?  18 seconds or 20 seconds.  When you go back out like that, they, audiences, as rotten as they can be, want to have a good time. 
[02:10:00]  They would have, but you just got ahead of them, man.  You can't pause.  Yeah, he stopped.  These ladies, how many, another question for the audience.  Are you ready to laugh?  Hey, another question.  I mean, when you have your second shot like that and walk out, now you've had time to reflect.  You take your atomic bomb out there.  You take the biggest weapon in your arsenal and hit him right between the eyes.  Yep.  Not another question for the audience.  And then they call all the women sluts. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  And now he's alienated.  I really didn't hear too many women's voices during those heckles, but now he's brought them on board.  Back to the tape.  Hey, anybody doesn't think size matter girls?  Where are you?  See, you guys don't get it.  You guys just don't get it.  I'm talking size.  You guys ain't giving me a chance, are you? 
[02:11:00]  So what, no f***ing tomatoes?  No, no, where are you, pussies?  All this is.  What?  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  You've been so kind.  And there he goes.  And that's when he walked off for the second time.  Now that A-hole chant, I don't know if they let it through. 
[02:11:30]  Maybe they let some of it through.  That went on for a really long time.  We had to cut that down a little bit there.  And then he was just standing there as they were chanting.  And then he said, F you.  I think he gave the crowd the finger and all that, too, as he was walking off.  Yeah, something like that.  But there's still a little more on there.  You hear an exchange between him and Rich.  Okay.  Oh.  I don't know these animals are going to do this.  What?  Billy Staples walking off like a pumpkin.  Billy Staples.  He's a good friend.  And you know what?  That's going to be a long drive home to Long Island. 
[02:12:00]  Ah, boss.  Boss really is a mean-spirited creep.  Did you hear him, though?  You had to know.  He thought no one was listening, you know.  What did he say?  Because he kind of pulled the mic aside.  And he goes, you had to know these animals were going to do this.  He didn't pull the mic aside.  He's too stupid to understand.  He's like, well, I want it to be a secret, so it will be.  Boss would cover his eyes with his little midget Jewish hands and go, no one can see me.  Rich, you're a dummy.  He's an animal.  Do those thoughts cohabit? 
[02:12:30]  You moaks.  And, Norton, you really want him to go back up again.  You know what?  I don't do that to mess with people.  I like Billy, man.  If he wants to work Long Island with me, he's welcome to.  I don't even want him to own cable anymore.  I don't want him to even see comedy.  I'm concerned about him.  So he's got to get to stop.  What Billy's got to realize is that's the fear.  People's greatest fear in life is public speaking.  And almost 99.99% of the public could never take what he took and then get back up again. 
[02:13:00]  That's what's going to make you different.  You're a comic, man.  You took it in the face.  Be a trooper.  Get back up.  That's it.  Get back up.  Never let them beat you.  Ever.  You know, he sounded like a broken, defeated man on your show last night, Ron.  Yeah, it was awful.  Yeah, it was.  It was depressing to listen to.  I was like, I so wanted to call up and just say, Patton should slap your fat face.  Well, I think a lot of that is just the pills.  You think it's the pills?  It's the pills, probably.  Where do they wear off? 
[02:13:30]  And he just feels the full burn.  And what's he doing in Pennsylvania?  Yellow belly?  It's as far as he could drive.  Is that it?  Yeah, I mean, you have to, you know, he rented a car that he hasn't returned, but you still  have to buy gas.  So he got as far as Amish country, and he's just sitting there with a brown paper bag  drinking out of it.  Yeah.  Taking the last of his pills.  All right, Ronnie, thank you so much.  All right, see you guys in a little bit.  We're going to leave this tape for you, because I'm sure you'll have a lot more to add to this  when you're hanging with Fezzy later tonight here in New York. 
[02:14:00]  We're going to dupe it and sell copies.  There you go.  Hey, see you guys.  You're the best.  Thank you, Ron.  All right, my friends.  All right.  There he goes, Ron from Ron and Fez, on right after us here in New York City, and we're  going to hand the tape over to them.  Yeah.  We'll give them the tape, and I want them to have the joy of watching it, because it  was indeed a videotape.  Can't be posted, though, unfortunately.  No.  For commercial reasons, I'll get sued.  Can't post it.  But I want to sit there and watch Ron and Fez watch that tape, is what I want to do, because 
[02:14:30]  it's brutal to watch him.  He's sweating.  He's twitching.  His hands are shaking.  I haven't seen it.  Oh, it's great.  It's not great.  No, it's great to watch.  It's brutal.  It makes me realize I have a heart, because he walks out.  He's so happy to be there.  He's excited.  It's his big gig with Norton.  You could tell he got the special shirt.  You could tell he looked in the mirror and said, man, I know I look good in this shirt.  I know I'm not the most attractive person.  This is the game, too. 
[02:15:00]  But this is it.  I know I look good in orange.  It was brand new.  It was pressed.  He comes out with that smile and puts one hand on the mic stand, and he's got the mic,  and he's ready to go.  It meant something to him.  It so meant something to him.  Seriously.  Seriously.  Next thing you know, you can just see his dream just crashing and burning in front of his eyes.  But, dude, I think, I'm not even plugging him.  If he wants to do Long Island with me, what I do, and I'm not goofing, I wouldn't do that to another act.  I'm more than welcome to have him.  I like Billy. 
[02:15:30]  He's good.  Go up all week.  You know, get your stuff in order.  Because I think he's got funny stuff, but it just wasn't because it threw him a little bit.  Sometimes you can have an hour of material, and you can't find any in your head because you're so like, all right, what do I do?  What do I do?  He should come out like Farley.  He should come out, get him laughing with the, hey, you know, down by the river, because he looks like him.  And then while they're laughing at that, you take the glasses off, and you start doing your act.  Kind of an attention getter.  I told you guys, I got booed like that in Chicago working with Dice.  And this was 14 people, 100 in Red Bank. 
[02:16:00]  I got 4,800 booing me.  I couldn't hear myself deliver my first joke, which I knew would kill.  In Chicago, they didn't know me.  So I'm bombing, and I'm thinking, well, you're a dead man.  And this was in the Maguire so-so race, and I just snapped.  I started insulting them and telling them Chicago stinks.  I hope Maguire wins.  Because I was going to bomb.  I'm going to let them know how I feel.  And then somebody heckled me.  And you can see when somebody heckles, they actually will stop for a second and let you.  And I got lucky.  I hammered him.  Somebody else heckled.  I hammered him, and the crowd laughed both times. 
[02:16:30]  Now you got him a little bit coming back.  They both laughed really big, and then there was that one moment.  Remember, they had that one moment Billy had.  I had that one moment, and the only difference between my set and his set was my joke did well,  and he made a different choice.  That's all it was.  He had that moment.  So I wound up having actually a very good set.  But it could have went the other way.  God, did I just babble.  Sorry.  It's all good.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Good news.  Another person that's not scared to be on our show today is going to be on next.  Pat Croce.  Oh, nice.  You got to talk about that slam ball we were checking out. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, very cool.  Oh, my God.  The best move I've ever seen in basketball was made that night.  Oh, cool.  Very cool.  There was a trampoline.  Don't yell at me.  I'm just saying I enjoyed it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, it's Bud Light.  Bud Light.  That would have made Billy's act a little better.  A little bit of Bud Light.  Because good times happen, Opie, when Bud Light is around.  Parties.  This summer.  This summer has been so goddamn hot.  Hot party.  And Bud Light's there to cool you down, but not fill you up.  No, you've still got plenty of energy to play the beach volleyball. 
[02:18:00]  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Swimming?  Yeah.  You drink a little Bud Light.  You cool off by the pool.  How about one of those?  I like those blow-up lounge chairs you put in the pool.  And then you just sit there.  You sip your Bud Light.  When it's empty, you roll off.  You swim to the edge.  You get another one.  Back up on there.  Bud Light makes summer so much fun.  It keeps the summer fun alive.  Sure does.  Next time you're out, ask for one.  A cold Bud Light.  Hey, Anthony.  It's Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Hey, are you still round like a beach ball?

I have to beat away the hiccup. 
[02:19:30]  Why don't you need the kids up on the table?  Here you go, create another table.  You wanted to.  I'm not rushing for the little hiccup.  You wanted to.  I'm not rushing for the little hiccup.  You wanted to.  Why don't you need the kids up on the table?  You wanted to.  I don't think you trust him.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:00]  Man, that rocks.  I love to cut it down.  Today's word of the day is...  Deja vu.  Boujade.  Boujade.  Deja vu.  What, Jim Norton?  Breaking news.  Uh-oh.  Heather Mills has just kicked off a leg during Rockettes.  I think...  I saw where you were going with that.  God, is that funny.  Rockettes. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, I suck.  You stink.  Heather Mills has just kicked off a leg in the middle of Rockettes' audition.  I screwed it up.  You suck.  Oh.  And we needed that one today.  That's not a bad line.  That's funny.  We need it.  That's a visual of her.  I like the visual.  Her leg flying off as she's humiliated as the other girls have two.  All of them with their arms around each other.  Da, da, da.  The one goes flying.  One little red Christmas boot on it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:21:00]  Hey.  We got an old friend on the hotline.  Hits a llama in the ass on stage.  Oh, I'd pay to see that.  Let's say hi to Pat Croce.  Yo, Opie.  Hello, Anthony.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  You take care of my buddy Jimmy there?  Hello.  Hello, Pat.  You have no problem being on this show today, sir?  No problem whatsoever.  Thank you, sir.  I got...  You got my full support.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pat.  We need it.  I hear.  Now, Opie, turn me on to this sport. 
[02:21:30]  This sport that you got going.  Slam ball.  Slam ball.  Anthony, even you can dunk in this sport.  This is unbelievable.  It looks like...  Talk about watching a show where you believe somebody is going to die during the course of  the program.  It's bad.  Why don't you explain it?  Because you could probably do it a lot better than I can.  A slam ball.  Think of an NBA regulation court.  Ninety-four feet.  But this entire court is spring-loaded.  So the whole thing gives to a degree. 
[02:22:00]  The entire glass and board's up from hockey.  So the ball is always in play.  And inlaid, inside the court, inside the three-point arc, at both ends of the court, are these  four competition-sized trampolines, strategically placed.  So when the players come down, it's four on four.  They come down.  They dribble.  And as soon as they hit the tramps, they are the dribble.  And they just take off.  And they all look like Michael Jordan, doing all kinds of outrageous maneuvers in the air,  extreme.  And the beautiful thing about it, guys, is that the defender can take them out. 
[02:22:30]  It's full contact.  Yeah, that's the part that I was like, oh, my God.  I can't believe what they're doing.  A defender will time it and hit the trampoline the same time the guy with the ball does.  They hit each other.  It looks like something out of a John Woo film.  Yeah.  They're, like, smacking each other 20 feet in the air.  Yeah.  The one guy is like a goalie in hockey.  Yeah.  Right.  He's called the stopper.  And what he does is it's four on four.  And it's only a 15-second shot clock.  So the game is really fast, high action, high impact, high flying. 
[02:23:00]  And that stopper's mentality is stop whatever and however he can.  And we have a couple of these guys.  They're most from inner city L.A. and inner city Chicago.  But a couple of them are football players.  All right.  So they got that.  You're being kind, Pat.  Your people sent the tape.  It looked like you guys were playing in a penitentiary.  Yeah.  In a penitentiary.  They looked like the Bloods versus the Crips.  I didn't know where they were from.  Right.  These guys.  I got it.  I got it.  No, they did look like a penitentiary.  But I got it.  But I got it, you ass.  And I saw you. 
[02:23:30]  And I knew you were hoping.  But you know what?  I made it.  No, you're right.  After two hours sleep in the hell we've been through today, that is bad.  That's bad, Jimmy.  I made it.  You're right.  It was like a river on cruiser.  Sorry, Pat.  Shut up.  But, Pat.  Yeah, we took a peek at the tape.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  You've been talking about slam ball for a while.  Last time we were in Philly, you were like, hey, there's something I'm working on.  And I got to be honest.  I'm like, I'm a huge basketball fan.  And I'm like, yeah, okay, I'll take a peek.  I was kind of interested.  But after actually seeing a game with the gang in the back office, this is unbelievable. 
[02:24:00]  Well, Opie, and I'm a big NBA fan.  This doesn't take the place of NBA.  I can't wait until it kicks up in October and November.  But this is just fun.  It's probably the first extreme team sport.  It's played on TNN, the new TNN, every Saturday at 8 o'clock.  And then for those who like to party and come back home around midnight, there's a re-telecast of it.  And the first two weeks have had great ratings, great response.  You know, it's something different.  That little bastard.  Who the hell was that guy?  That's what I was going to ask him.  Who was that guy? 
[02:24:30]  God, I couldn't tell you the team or anything.  He hit that trampoline.  He takes the ball.  It went under his leg to the other hand where he then hooked it over his head, doing a 360, and slammed that thing.  You know who he is.  His nickname is Inches.  They call him Sean Jackson.  But he's in the Nike commercials that does all that freestyling with the basketball to music.  Oh, okay.  He's unbelievable.  He's our Allen Iverson of slam ball.  He looked like he was 17 feet off the ground. 
[02:25:00]  He probably is.  These guys get way over the rim.  There's one guy that gets his armpit over top of the backboard.  So you're talking, he can get up there as 20 feet.  And I like the names of the teams.  We were watching a game.  I think it was the Mobs versus the Crips.  The Steel or it could be Diablos.  Diablos.  Oh, yeah, Diablos.  I thought, yeah, that's one of the gangs in Grand Theft Auto 3. 
[02:25:30]  And it does.  It just looks like gang warfare happening.  And the goal is hopefully that it gets a great response and we kick it up again next year.  We look like to get a tour out there because we want tryouts.  We want 600 players tried out for these 48 spots.  It's eight players on a team, four only play at a time, only six teams.  And we want to kick it up to another degree of athleticism and that element of fear.  And hopefully in the year 2004, maybe we have a slam ball court in all those twin rinks all over the city.  Yeah, it looks really exciting. 
[02:26:00]  You know, I can't wait for the video game.  It's obvious that someone's going to make a video game of this.  It's perfect.  It truly is a human video game.  We're just watching it.  Right.  And it's perfect for your audience because they're half nuts.  I didn't think I would like it and I wound up loving it.  I'm like, I'm not going to like this.  And I think after I saw that guy make that move, I could not stop watching it.  Jimmy, I can't see how you, and if you saw it in person, you'd really be impressed because these guys whack it.  There's no script involved.  These guys are some tough nuts.  It was violent.  It was, I really enjoyed it, man.  And I didn't expect to. 
[02:26:30]  I really liked it.  Cool.  Talk about being a little frightened.  I don't know.  Where do they tape that?  We did it in L.A.  I wouldn't want to, to tell you the truth, I don't think I want to see one live there, Pat.  I don't think I'd fit in with the crowd that I saw sitting for the first game I saw.  It was like a John Singleton film.  It really did.  Hey, Pat, you need a couple guys to do the pregame show or what?  Hey, man, we'd love to have you.  The death mill.  Hey, listen, when we kick it up to the next notch, I'll call you back, Ope. 
[02:27:00]  I would love to have you and Anthony do that.  I would do that in a second because I just love hoops, but.  Yeah, well, we'll see if we need a job.  Hey, Pat, you doing anything else, like jumping off buildings or anything?  No, I'm chilling right now down this shore, chilling right now.  What NBA team are you going to be working for next year?  None right now.  None right now.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  We need to get a scoop from you.  No, no scoop.  There's no scoop available, bro.  You're going to be doing the TV again?  No, NBA is now on ABC 15 of the games, so the 35 games left the NBC. 
[02:27:30]  The rest are picked up by ESPN, TNT, and TBS.  So there'll be plenty of games on, but most of them will be on cable.  Oh, man, they need you, though.  You did a great job last year.  Well, there might be some opportunities when NBA and AOL joins forces  and they create this new NBA TV.  So who knows?  But thanks, Oop.  Okay.  And remember, I still, remember, you still got to go to a game with me.  Um, I know. 
[02:28:00]  I blew my chance.  I gave you a couple good opportunities, didn't I?  I know.  We had something going on.  We had to go to New Orleans somewhere.  You could have met Jordan.  No, you know what you want?  You went to Boston, or you went somewhere north, I guess, when...  I had the chance to meet Jordan, and I blew it.  Yeah.  I blew it.  The guy offered you...  No, there was...  Well, that one, you wanted Jordan, you wanted the Wizards and Sixers.  I got your court side.  Then you wanted the finals, Lakers versus...  It was the Nets.  And I got you that.  And then all of us, you guys went to...  You went Boston.  You went somewhere north to do a remote. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  You should be thrown in a penitentiary for that.  I got it out, though.  I really got...  It's been a long 24 hours.  You got to give me that one.  He got you the tickets, though.  Yeah, I know he did.  All right, Pat.  The big plug, please.  The big plug?  Yeah, for Sunday.  Flambor.  Saturday nights, 8 o'clock on the new TNN.  Check it out.  All right.  Thank you, Pat.  See you, Anthony.  See you, Jimmy.  Bye, Mr. Croce.  See you, guys.  We'll talk to you soon.  You got it.  All right.  Talk about somebody who's out of his mind. 
[02:29:00]  He's a maniac.  That guy, he's a great guy.  Yeah, he is.  He's full of energy.  There's a guy that forgave us.  Jim.  Oh, that's right, Jim.  Jim made a really big full palm when we first saw him.  And don't even repeat it.  I'm not going to.  I don't want Mr. Croce to get mad again.  I'm not going to, but I forgot about that.  As mad as he got, the Philly listeners loved it because they're like, hey, all right.  That was where I got certain information from.  But it's all water under the bridge we made up.  And I'm glad he forgave me because he's a black belt and a maniac.  He could kick your ass.  He really could savagely beat me.  Yeah.  He looks like the type of guy that could just throw a savage beat. 
[02:29:30]  He was joking around with me when we went to Philly for the first time.  He goes, oh, hey, is this Norton?  And he threw like a karate move next to my head.  And I didn't think he was going to hit me.  But I realized this man could savagely.  He could take my clothes off and just slap my fat body.  And I would do nothing but yell, quit it.  His bitch slap you.  Yeah.  As a goof.  Like a little chubby gal.  I stink.  Anthony, what's going on?  What's up, all my names are Norton.  How you guys doing?  Hello, sir.  Thanks for calling.  Oh, you're welcome, sir.  Hey, can I make an observation, Anthony? 
[02:30:00]  Sure.  Just throw these things in from time to time.  Uh-huh.  I think we lost our whole listening audience today to TV.  You think so?  Yeah.  What's up, Anthony?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I started watching that play ball probably about three weeks ago.  Two weeks ago.  I can't.  Your phone, you've got to have the worst phone ever.  I just want to know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't  know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.  You can't hear me?  Are you talking into a football?  Yeah, now it's better.  Now you can hear me?  Yeah.  I was going to say the coolest thing about that game is when the guys, they take a 
[02:30:30]  three-pointer, when they bounce off the backboard, and the guy just comes sailing  out of nowhere.  Yeah.  To take it and just dunk it.  And these guys, they have 15, 20 feet in the air going at least like 15, 20 miles an hour.  And they slam into each other.  They're insane.  Head of the slam ball.  Banging heads, man.  I bet you after that game, every one of them needs penicillin.  Wait a minute, guys.  Why are you doing this to me?  You know I got it out because I looked at you when I was panicking.  I know.  I'm kidding.  I feel bad for Billy. 
[02:31:00]  I feel bad for Billy, the poor guy.  At least you do good.  He bombs.  He has to go to Pennsylvania.  I was panicking, but you know I made it through.  Hey, Ben, can you give me a pen?  You know why I'm doing this?  It's because of his Heather Mills flub.  That was a good joke.  People are not going to forget the Heather Mills thing.  All right?  As much as you could, you know, you want to pound me for my little faux pas.  I really am, Ben.  Yeah, dude.  That was a good joke.  And I totally tripped on it.  As it was coming out, I knew I screwed. 
[02:31:30]  I should have rehearsed it once in the mirror like I do with a ruler.  You have made everyone paranoid in this stupid studio, though.  But, dude, I'm the first one to acknowledge if I have like a little, don't forget the apostrophe,  flub.  I've been flubbing for years.  And it's never mattered until you came into our stupid lives.  And it's worked.  Dude, Voss lives a flub.  Now, every time I know I'm flubbing, I have to look at you.  I'm going to laugh at you.  See, Anthony's going to let me slide.  He'll let me slide every time.  I let him slide all the time.  But there you, you get all excited. 
[02:32:00]  You really do.  Oh, you're such a creep.  Because you're mean-spirited.  You throw little balls of paper at me and no one sees that.  They think, oh, I bet he's tussling little Jimmy's hair right now.  But you're not.  You're throwing things and being mean.  I usually don't see that.  I used to throw razor blades.  Ask Ed.  I'm glad you don't throw razor blades.  I used to.  On the old tape-cutting days.  Yeah, it's really antisocial.  All right.  Vinny, what's going on?  Vin?  Oh.  Vin, you're on open air.  Hi, Vin. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, Vinny.  Oh.  What's up, Vinny?  Yo, I just want to say that show is awesome.  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah.  I was watching it the other night.  I seen that guy do a 360 under his leg.  I almost asked myself.  That was great, right?  Oh.  Awesome.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  He's great.  Oh, my God.  We're starting to sweat because that's all that's coming in on the phones.  What?  People talking about slam ball.  Dude, what else are you going to talk about? 
[02:33:00]  Are you going to talk about October 26th and the Cleveland?  Who cares?  There's no one stupid Civic Lakewood Auditorium.  Nobody cares.  I'm not shameless.  I'm not discussing that.  No.  Oh, God.  We'd have just...  We'd have cleared the finish line by leaps and bounds if we were able to discuss certain  things today.  It's been just this clawing and trying to not talk about things.  I feel like the people that hung with us today, Anthony, just to give you an idea, we would 
[02:33:30]  have just started talking about the baseball strike right now.  Right.  Right now.  But, you know, we did that two and a half hours ago.  Oh, it would have been insane.  But right about now, we would have added other things to the program.  Could have potted up the old television.  All fun stuff like that.  But now...  It's all this pent-up frustration.  Oh, God.  He just threw the stapler at little Jimmy. 
[02:34:00]  Wow.  You okay?  Yeah.  I'm used to seeing staples just hit the floor.  Oh, God.  Now we can all laugh together.  Poor Billy.  Boy, we're going to need a bit or something because we're dying.  How are you, uh...  Clean cuisine?  Notice Voss has just avoided us like the plank.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:30]  That's kind of hurt my career.  Oh, yeah.  He's blubbering through something haphazardly, just trying to look for the words.  What did he say yesterday?  It was so awful.  Oh, uh, con.  Cohabit?  Cohabit.  Did that cohabit?  Did the scores cohabit?  Cohabit?  You're going to get lamb-bashed.  Yeah, we, um...  Wow.  We're in a jam now.  Now he'll throw something. 
[02:35:00]  We're in a jam.  No, I won't throw anything.  You will.  How are you leaving?  No, I won't.  What?  How are you leaving?  I see a couple nice couches around here.  Oh, are you going to hang out for a little bit?  It's very difficult to, uh, leave the building.  Walk right through them.  Yeah?  Mind your business.  Uh, do you have a...  No, I don't.  Mind your goddamn business.  Yeah.  Just slap them.  All I'm going to say to them, Westbury 7th, Long Island.  Ooh.  Westbury 7th.  Westbury 7th.  Westbury 7th. 
[02:35:30]  Hmm.  Westbury.  Westbury 7th.  7th.  Yeah.  You meant to say September 7th.  At Westbury.  Is it, Jimmy?  Yeah, that's called the old quick plug.  The old quick plug.  Lakewood 26th in October.  That's called I'm Out of the Barrel and you're in.  Oh.  That's not, but I, I didn't, it was one of those little flubs.  I didn't know one of the months was called Westbury.  Yes.  Vos checking in.  Were you talking about me?  Hey.  Hi, Rich.  Hey, I'm not avoiding you guys.  Hi, Angel.  Hey, Cookie Puss. 
[02:36:00]  I, uh, I was playing golf today.  38-44.  Uh, you know.  Hey, you know what?  Now I really feel bad about that whole Billy thing.  Why?  I don't know.  You loved it and you dragged him back out on stage.  No, you know what?  I didn't drag him back out.  I didn't twist his arm.  I figured, you know what?  Maybe if he came back out this time, they would listen.  He regrouped a little.  Oh, you've been in the business long enough to know that wasn't going to happen.  You didn't think that.  No, you didn't.  You were enjoying the show so much that you had to get him back out there. 
[02:36:30]  I know I led them into the room.  I thought there were showers.  How was I supposed to know?  You knew it was happening, you awful man.  Listen, here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Comics love...  If you don't know the comic, it doesn't matter.  But if it's a friend of yours and they're tanking it...  You're right, dude.  ...there is nothing more funny.  Because you're watching them try to get out of it.  You're watching them sweat.  It's hilarious.  I mean, if it's someone you don't know, you don't care.  You just go, oh, he stinks.  But you know, we know. 
[02:37:00]  Billy's worked with me before.  He's done well.  You know.  So it was just funny watching.  All right.  I watched you bomb once for 45 minutes in Connecticut.  I watched...  Yeah.  And I mean nothing.  And I've never giggled harder.  It was hilarious.  Smoking with a ponytail.  Just getting nothing from people who wanted to have fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, you know what I...  One of my favorite bombings was watching Jimmy bomb in front of, like, 10 people at Dangerfields.  Yeah, you actually saw that.  I wish I had a tape of that. 
[02:37:30]  I bomb constantly, dude, doing gigs like that.  No, no, I know.  But then you decided to start doing Voss' material as Voss.  And you were getting big laughs.  And I was with Voss.  And Voss was getting so pissed.  I wanted to get out of the head.  Yes, you were.  And then you stood up and was screaming, yelling, hey, that's my material.  And no one believed you.  Get out of here.  Did I do that?  I wish I had a tape of that.  Because he was doing the whole Voss delivery with the...  Voss' material.  I was telling you.  The exaggerated faces and all.  Mm-hmm.  Showed you the type of proud they were.  They like it very low-brow, apparently. 
[02:38:00]  And then Jim goes, okay, enough of that.  And it goes back to his material.  And it was one of those nights for Jimmy.  He'll admit it, right?  Yes.  Nothing.  Nothing.  So all of a sudden Voss stands up and goes, how about you do more of my jokes?  Do more of my acts.  So he does it even more exaggerated and getting big laughs.  I must confess.  Well, listen, here's the deal.  You guys have nothing today and neither do I.  So I'm not going to stay on...  Yeah, don't try to bond. 
[02:38:30]  Creep.  We had some good stuff today.  Rob, what's up?  Rich is hurtful.  Hey.  Hey.  I'll tell you what.  You know what this show is like today?  Huh?  Here's what it's like.  This show's like a rain delay or when you go to a ball game.  It's like an extra inning game.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden there's no beer.  Ten o'clock.  And now it's one o'clock in the morning.  And the announcer says, hey, guess what?  You get free tickets to another bad show.  I'm out of here, precious.  We're going to have a doubleheader, though, Monday.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  It's just a matter of when we came in here today, we had an entire show planned. 
[02:39:00]  We had sound clips.  We had stories.  We had phone calls.  We had things that were printed out to read.  Look at this.  I'm looking at it right now.  We were going to do an interview with the UK today.  Right.  We had an entire fun-filled show planned for you today.  Today's a rain delay, but Monday it'll be a doubleheader.  And it's also bat day.  I like the baseball analogies, because right now we are in a pennant race. 
[02:39:30]  Dude, you messed up twice and messed up once.  And at exactly 2.40, we were told what we could or could not speak of.  And everything went out the window.  And I was like, but that's been on my mind.  And you're right.  I really would like to chat about it.  And you're right.  They did tell us.  Yeah.  You're right.  Yeah.  And this time, we decided to listen. 
[02:40:00]  Well, you know how...  It's better that way sometimes.  Things go.  The lawyers say they know best.  And, you know.  Hey, Paul.  Hey.  What's up, Paul?  I'm still diagramming Rob's analogy.  That was a little complicated for me.  It's a good show today.  Oh, thanks.  I was just calling in to...  Hey, and you had a good show yesterday.  Thank you.  It's nice to see the sun, huh?  It's nice. 
[02:40:30]  I had a segment I wanted to talk about how to prepare your soil for planting your bulbs for the fall season.  Oh, that's exciting.  That could fill a little time.  Yeah.  I think it's a fine show.  Hey, Paul, I think we're going to do this on another date.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Get those T-shirts made.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  Can't wait for the latest T-shirt.  I'm reading a new...  I'm reading something else on the web.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I haven't seen...  I haven't seen this yet.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Uh-oh.  Hmm.  What?  I don't know.  Something is...  Oh, look at that.  Ken Stevens.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That and then...  Oh.  We don't know.  I want to know who...  Hmm?  Hmm?  Ha-ha-ha. 
[02:41:30]  That's a funny statement.  I wish I could read it.  It's very funny.  It's on Newsday.com.  I think it's a...  Uh...  Whoa.  Hey.  Uh...  Remember that thing?  Do you remember?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  Look at who wrote it.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  Who?  So that goes...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Which means it has to be true. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's a true...  That's a true statement then.  Oh, yeah.  That's not your, um...  Your local guy.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  See, it's just odd to not be able to talk about that.  It wasn't a regular feature.  Mm-hmm.  Um...  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  Hey.  See?  We're going to break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let's see if we can't, uh, dig something up.  And, uh...  And, uh...  And, uh...  And, uh, get through.  Make it to the end. 
[02:42:30]  Stop blowing on my arm, you tool.  God.  Dan Norton.  And I sit there going, he's going to stop.  For some reason, he must have to blow on my arm right now.  But he'll stop in a second.  Well, you know what you do is you breathe next to somebody through your nose.  Just those two little jets...  Two little jets of air.  Two little jets of cooled air blowing on the arm of another man.  That is horrible.  You're the worst.  Gently.  Gently.  Gently.  You know how many times I hear in the back office, stop that?  I'll be doing something so I'm not looking at you. 
[02:43:00]  And someone else in the office will just yell, stop that.  Stop that or don't touch me.  Stop touching me.  The little gentle touches on the back of the neck.  He'll grab you under your forearm like you would grab a girl you're in love with.  Very gently.  And go, yeah, that thing was great.  And then you go, oh, okay.  And then he won't remove his hand.  He'll just stand there all uncomfortable and you've got to say, stop touching me.  Yeah, all right.  Just gently touch. 
[02:43:30]  Well, you place what really creeps guys out.  I get godfrey with this all the time.  I place my three fingertips, not my thumb or my pinky, on his forearm very lightly when  I'm talking and I'm like...  My hand's clean.  I'm like, dude, what time are we going to go down there?  And it just really creeps him out.  It is creepy.  It's just a gentle...  Get out of here.  Get a little touch.  Just in case you're keeping track at home, Anthony.  Yeah.  O&A, it's a clean sweep for you in New York City.  The PBJ thing has been mentioned on every news channel.  1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 12. 
[02:44:00]  We'll be back.  I love snatch.  Spring on the horse.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You filthy crazy.  Words than anthrax.  That's going to make a sweeper.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Where's the kaboom?  Hey, Anthony, it's Sam Adams.  If you're an artist or even just somebody who likes to doodle, don't I sound like the  guy that does that commercial for the art school? 
[02:44:30]  Yes, I do.  Grab some crayons.  Grab some oak tag or construction paper and you might be the winner of the Sam Adams Billboard  Contest.  There's a nice, safe little contest.  The Sam Adams Billboard Contest.  Actual billboard size, 26 feet by 24 feet.  Winning artwork is going to be posted on a billboard for the entire month of October.  Winner's name picture and winning artwork will be celebrated in print in Time Out New York  magazine.  All you've got to do is drink some of that wonderful Sam Adams and then draw it up.

Freedom to drink a great American beer.  Sam Adams.  The O.B.  and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, nine, be in Mississippi.  I'm going to talk about the puppies.

If this isn't in Mississippi, this isn't inizzy. I'm going to say are you breathing?  No.  Do the wie  you see how you feel  or anything you'll make you know.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:46:00]  Let's get right into what do we learn today.  Let's see how clever the audience could get today, Anthony.  Troy, what's going on, man?  Hey, I understand you guys have had a really rough 24 hours.  I just wanted to, O.P., I wanted to offer you a penny for your thoughts.  Hope to see you in Sacramento soon, Dolly Dimples.  I'm working on a date right now, Angel. 
[02:46:30]  Dolly Dimples?  That's horrible.  That's another man.  Isaac, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Today I learned how to make a buffalo zucchini seem insignificant.  Oh, wow.  God, that is good.  Hey, he gave himself a...  Thanks, guys.  I'm out.  Peace.  Let's go to Ebony and Ivory.  Ebony.  Hi, guys.  Howdy. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, hey.  Hello, tell-of-cheeks.  Oh.  I learned three things today.  Yeah.  I learned Gabby from Weird Science has a stomach flu.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Gabby from Weird Science, yeah.  I learned Grey Goose and Coke are awful together, but it takes the edge off.  Right.  And Billy got heckled at the White Apollo.  Nice.  The White Apollo.  Later, guys.  Bye, Ebony.  Love you.  I love you.  The White Apollo.  Love you, Ebony.  Love you, Francine.  Thank you, Ebony.  Hi.  Hi, hi, hi, hi.  Charlie from Rockland County. 
[02:47:30]  I learned today, nothing.  I was too busy scanning the TV looking for details.  Right.  Go to the busy phones.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned it's probably not a good idea to ask a bunch of 20-year-olds if they've had a colonoscopy.  Yeah, we learned that today, huh?  Anybody have a colonoscopy?  And I learned, um, and a dentistry should be in the next owner's pulling date.  Oh. 
[02:48:00]  Oh.  Later.  Thank you, Uncle John.  You know, we could have bailed today, man.  You should have.  Shut up.  Shut up, Steve.  Sorry, Ope.  That's hilarious.  I'll give it to you.  See.  We were given the option.  You guys could go in there and struggle, or you could, uh, just bail and put on some more  of that old best-of crap.  Believe me, Ope, we struggled with you.  All right, cool.  What's up, Steve?  Uh, today I learned that, uh, Opie don't know nothing.  Yes. 
[02:48:30]  And that's all I got, because I'm feeling kind of ten-sib.  Later up.  See you, man.  That's what's there.  Ah, that is very funny.  You out-flubbed me today.  Screw fair.  That's funny.  And I get screwed.  Yeah.  Westbury 7th?  Yeah.  It doesn't even matter.  It doesn't matter?  He's part of the Westbury 7th.  Yeah, Lakewood 26.  We could do it all the plugs.  Yeah.  Damn Cleveland.  Hmm.  I hate when I read something that says, good hint, aunt. 
[02:49:00]  I have no clue what I said.  Sheep Lover writes, I learned today, Palestine starts with pal, so Israel and Palestine should  be pals.  Pals!  He also learned, if a horse or a mule kicks you in the face, you kick it back.  He also learned in Monopoly, landing on luxury tax is better than landing on go to jail.  Hmm.  Jersey Gary learned, even a stubby-fingered midget like Rich Voss can feel like Michael  Jordan playing slam ball. 
[02:49:30]  And now ONA know what it feels like to be Soupy Drek.  With his bad shirt.  His Voss shirt.  That's a crime, that shirt.  From yesterday?  Yeah.  With those little Hershey Kiss nips.  I wanted to punch his chest with a sandblaster.  It was so annoying.  Everyone comments on his tan and he looks at him like, what are you, what, what, of course  I look like a black man.  I take my kids to the pool.  Rotten little dark Arabic areolas really annoyed me. 
[02:50:00]  Punch yourself from Jersey.  I learned today, the next time Paul Mercurio is on the Daily Show.  Yeah.  I'm looking at you.  I got it out.  Yeah.  They might turn the cameras on.  That's really good.  I'm going to have to watch the Daily Show.  It's on tonight, right?  That is so goddamn funny.  There's some weird thing they're doing.  You're under arrest.  Taxi!  Hey, what's happening, guys? 
[02:50:30]  What's up?  Hey, Jason.  How you doing today?  I learned today that Mayor Bloomberg is most assuredly still living.  Huddle, huddle, huddle to the ribs.  Yeah, what's an elbow to the ribs?  Huddle, huddle, huddle to the ribs.  Huddle, huddle, huddle to the ribs.  Huddle, huddle to the ribs.  Had a stroke on elbow.  Bobby, what's up?  Bob?  Hey, sorry.  I learned today that I could listen to the radio for four hours straight  and learn absolutely nothing about what happened yesterday. 
[02:51:00]  That's true.  It is true.  Hey, I'm calling from Sacramento, and I, you know, if you guys would have been recorded,  I still would have learned the same nothing.  And you belong in a dump, you F.  There's Frenchie.  I was like, who hit the sound effect?  But it's really Frenchie.  You belong in Staten Island, you dumbass.  What's up, Frenchie?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, guys.  How you doing something today?  Yeah.  How you doing, Harry Hookline?  Hey, how you doing, Baldi?  Huh?  Baldi?  I learned that boss is a wannabe guinea.  Of course he is. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I heard that in the back office yesterday.  It was funny.  I think it came from your mouth, Anthony.  Very great.  Thank you for the credit.  Yeah, huh?  How you doing, guys?  Very, very good.  Yeah.  Although we can't really say anything.  Yeah, I know.  You can't talk.  Yeah, huh?  You know.  Ick snag.  Maybe I should say it in French, and nobody can understand it anyway, so, you know.  We can't even leave the building, Frenchie.  Ouch.  Coussois.  Coussois.  And anyway, those two retards I didn't call, and thank God, I never want to be stuck with 
[02:52:00]  those two asses ever again, all right?  All right.  All right, Frenchie.  All right, thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Angel.  Hey, see you later, honey.  Honey.  I like Frenchie.  It was a rough, rough, rough day for the boys.  Hey, CJ.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's going on?  I've been waiting for the last two hours for the brewer bit.  I know.  Today, I want to tell you, I learned that you guys just got blown off by arguably the  biggest dork in movie history. 
[02:52:30]  And according to the tape, Billy Staples is definitely not at the pinnacle of his career.  And pretty much lawyers ruin everything, right?  That's what I've always said.  Thank you, CJ.  Love you, guys.  All right.  I learned Anthony had his period to get out of gym class.  Yeah.  See?  Wow.  We had a little education.  Hey, look at Sean from Sacramento.  We're live in Sacramento for the month of August. 
[02:53:00]  You know, I learned it's kind of hard to listen to a show like this twice.  Oh, that's right.  They just replay it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was wondering if I could use that to my advantage.  Hey, Sean.  Remember to drop off those movies today.  Oh, you might as well.  Hey, that's good.  Tom from Hoboken calling this the Godfather 3 of radio shows.  Oh, you suck.  Dad?  At least it was in Leonard Part 6. 
[02:53:30]  Nothing.  Just let it sit.  Yeah.  Sometimes you just got to let somebody take their body.  Just let it sit.  Look, he goes, nothing.  But you lost faith in that one between Leonard and Part 6.  Right.  Leonard Part 6.  Because I realized I should have picked a sequel.  Nothing.  Thinking Leonard Part 6 might have been the movie they made after Leonard Part 5.  The sixth installation.  I know.  That's why I had no...  I'm like, uh-oh.  You didn't even wait to see. 
[02:54:00]  I didn't pick a sequel.  You didn't wait to see if it was one of those things people had to think over and then you  get the late laugh.  Leonard Part 6.  Nothing?  Yeah.  Leonard.  Nothing.  No, it's only a problem with words that start with P.  You're right.  P-E-N, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I think you're pinnacle.  P-I-N.  But it depends on if you're from Buffalo.  Don't bring up Buffalo.  That, you know what?  You did miss a good sequel.  Pen and Tentery 2. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you, Big Kev.  How are we doing in Buffalo?  How's that whole debacle going?  I think the Buffalo problem is secondary at this point.  Yeah.  That's one good...  That's one plus.  Mm-hmm.  Makes other things we do look really like nothing.  Yeah.  Let's get out of here, okay?  Although they do seem to list them.  Let's get out of here, all right?  Okay.  Let's do that. 
[02:55:00]  No comment.  Your mom's box.  Oh, no.  Your mom's box.  That's right.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box. </pre>
