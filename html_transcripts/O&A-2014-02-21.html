<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with highly misogynistic commentary on the Women's Olympic Hockey game between Canada and the USA, focusing on the American team's emotional response to their loss.  The hosts used vulgar terms to describe the female athletes and also mocked the judging in the women's figure skating competition.  They then transitioned to a scathing, vulgar critique of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, playing a news report detailing traffic violations committed by his security detail, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of his traffic safety initiatives.

Next, the show delved into a five-week weight loss challenge featuring E-Rock and Roland. E-Rock detailed his struggles with Dr. Ian Smith's "Super Shred" diet and workout plan, specifically highlighting the difficulty of the high-impact workout DVD.  Dr. Smith, via a phone call with poor audio quality, defended his program and expressed frustration with Roland’s alternative approach, which involved eating bacon and cheese omelets daily and walking.  Roland, present in the studio, defended his methods. A weigh-in revealed E-Rock lost 11 pounds and Roland lost 24 pounds.  Dr. Smith awarded E-Rock half his promised prize money, with the remaining funds going towards a SiriusXM staff pizza party. The segment included numerous off-color jokes and sexual innuendo.

Following this, the show hosted Sean F., a caller known for writing songs about E-Rock. Sean F. performed several songs, including "You're Fat as Fuck" and "Lazy Guy," focusing on E-Rock's weight.  E-Rock displayed visible discomfort and anger, remaining largely silent.  Sean F. gifted E-Rock a Homer Simpson Mr. Potato Head and a Simpsons comic book; E-Rock subsequently smashed the Potato Head.  Listeners called in, reacting to the awkward yet humorous situation.  The segment also briefly touched upon Jonathan Davis of Korn's comments on media manipulation and the Canadian hockey game.

A segment dedicated to listener-submitted videos and reminiscences about Woodstock '94 and '99 followed, featuring explicit language and descriptions of the festivals’ chaos.  The hosts discussed various bands, including Green Day and Rage Against the Machine, and compared audience participation across different bands using video clips.  A picture of a radio personality with his exposed penis was mentioned. A caller shared a disastrous nachos-in-a-mosh-pit experience. The segment concluded with an in-studio interview with Ty West, director of *The Sacrament*, where they discussed the film, the Jonestown massacre, and other cults, again using explicit language. The hosts promoted West's film before concluding the broadcast.  A soundbite from a chaotic home video featuring a child and a scooter was played at some point during the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, good morning everyone.  Whoa, that was a little louder than...  It's Opie and Anthony time.  There we go.  Now we're good.  Mofos.  Hi, everybody.  Wow, made it to the big, what they call the weekend.  Ah, Friday, yeah.  Is that what this is? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, apparently it's going to be what?  It's going to be what?  I think it's going to be like 80 today or something.  85.  85 degrees near the city.  Yeah, balmy.  And then we return to negative 36.  The polar vortex comes back Monday.  I heard that again.  Is that really true?  Yeah, we're going to freeze again.  Polar vortex.  Is that going to be one of those words that like...  And one of the big words of this year was polar vortex.  Back to you.  Oh, they always do that shit. 
[00:01:00]  I hate the fucking news.  But I get very excited because Saturday mornings, as you're going to bed, I'm getting up.  Yes.  And I watch the local news and then I watch Good Morning America and I have my coffee on my laptop and I couldn't be happier.  It's a comedy.  It's horrendous.  Yeah.  And they all think they're good at it, but they're just doing the same shit everyone else is doing.  No one is stepping forward and trying to figure out how to do it differently.  All schlocky shit. 
[00:01:30]  And then GMA, just watch GMA.  You can watch it today.  Yeah.  They just laugh the entire show.  And you really try to focus like, wait, was there anything actually funny in there?  Why are they laughing?  And you realize, no.  It's just, I guess if you're on TV on one of those goof shows, you just have to be up, happy, and laughing at everything.  Everything around you.  That's what they tell them.  They tell them, look, we've got to get people, you know, up and feeling good.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're very bubbly, but.  Yeah.  There's Rob Ford losing his mind, huh?  On Deadspin. 
[00:02:00]  He's jumping up and down like a child would.  He's Chris Farley.  Like a child would jump up and down.  And he's getting like two inches off the ground because he's big and fat.  He's Chris Farley playing Rudy Giuliani's kid.  Right.  In that club.  Yes.  Obviously, he's very excited about Canada, the women's hockey team.  Yes.  Winning against the U.S. in overtime.  Yes.  I watched the.  Yeah.  That was a biggie.  Yeah.  I watched the overtime.  They play pretty damn good, these broads. 
[00:02:30]  These broads?  These broads play really good.  And there's a lot of hot hockey players.  But then a few of them, like, whoa.  Really hot?  Wow.  They would beat the shit out of all of us.  Oh, like fucking bruisers.  I think one of them is like a backup goalie or the regular goalie.  She took her mask off and it was just like, holy fuck.  Like a guy?  Yeah.  Like a bruiser?  Like maybe she should be tested.  There might have been some illegal activity going on.  But then there's some nice fucking looking chicks. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  Broads.  And then the Americans lost and they just, because they are broads in the end.  Yeah.  They are broads.  I mean, they're playing a tough sport, but in the end they're broads.  When push comes to shove.  They're just broads.  They're broads.  And what will broads do?  They'll cry.  Oh, boy, do they cry.  Were they crying?  They were crying.  And they do have, like, eye makeup on, I guess.  Yeah, they kind of look good. 
[00:03:30]  So they're crying after the Canadians, you know, beat them.  And there was something extremely hot about it.  Sexy about it?  You just want to cuddle them and make them feel good?  Oh, yeah.  But there's tears just running down their faces.  And then they're just spoiling it for the Canadians.  You know, we're Americans.  Sure.  But I got to tell it like it is.  The Canadians won the gold medal.  Yeah.  And you got the Americans on the ice just fucking it all up with their tears and their sadness.  It's like, get off the ice. 
[00:04:00]  Get off the fucking ice.  Stop crying on our battlefield of victory.  And you can see the Canadian broads.  They're kind of, like, trying to move away from the Americans.  That's great.  The party poopers.  Yeah.  It was a great game, though.  It was a lot of fun to watch.  So congratulations to Sidney Crosby and the rest of the Canadians' women's hockey team for their gold medal.  Now, when does the real hockey game, when do we play that one? 
[00:04:30]  Soon.  Against the...  A few hours, right?  The USA and Canada playing again, but it's the men's.  When did they...  Huh?  For the gold, right?  Yeah.  When did they drop the puck?  This is not for the gold.  Oh, it's the semifinal round.  Right, right.  But it's against the Canadians, so everyone is talking about that.  What time did they drop the puck?  12 o'clock, I think.  Oh, you said that.  Okay.  12 o'clock.  It's for bragging rights.  I'm bragging rights.  12 o'clock.  Fuck.  Everyone's going to be watching. 
[00:05:00]  You should watch that one.  That's a big one.  I'll probably watch that one.  The Canadians are, I would assume, favored on this one.  But we're playing pretty good.  USA's playing pretty good.  Let's see what happens.  A lot of controversy with the women's skating.  Figure skating.  Oh, yeah.  That's your sport.  That Russian chick.  Yeah.  Not the little, little one.  The other one.  There's another one.  Yeah.  She won.  Yeah.  And holy fuck, people are calling foul.  Two judges.  One of them is married to one of these Russian fucking bigwigs. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And the other one was suspended.  Right.  For cheating back in, like, two Olympics ago.  So they're claiming shenanigans.  I guess the Koreans are a little pissed off because their little skaty chick got silver.  Right.  And the Russian got gold.  And they're saying she didn't even deserve to get that gold.  This was a big fucking cheat over Yuna Kim.  They're saying Yuna Kim should have won.  But Adelina Sotnikova. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  She won the gold.  Who's Yuna Kim?  She's that Korean girl.  Right.  She's from Korea.  Korea.  She, yeah, and people are saying she did better.  She should have won.  But because of the cheating Russians, look out.  She could have been from America, too.  That name, there's only two places you could be from.  Korea or America.  Korea or an adopted family from America.  That's pretty much it.  Or adopted. 
[00:06:30]  I'm going to shut up.  I'm going to shut up.  You thought better of it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Oh, yeah.  I hear you.  I don't think there's anything else in the Olympics, though, that are like.  There it is.  I mean, it was three and a half minutes left there.  Up 2-0.  Seemed to be cruising.  The Canadians cut it to 2-1 at 3.26 left.  The Americans had an empty net shot.  Hit the post.  An inch away from being at 3-1.  That would have won the game.  And then with about a minute left, Canada ties it up and wins it in overtime. 
[00:07:00]  Jesus, with a minute left.  I will tell you, I talked to somebody very close to the Canadian.  They were up two goals when I think five minutes left and the Canadians came back.  The only people that don't know that are the Americans.  And they played really well in overtime, too.  But afterward, as you might imagine.  Isn't this the third Olympics finals that we've lost, our women have lost to the Canadians?  Oh, man.  The Canadians have won four in a row.  And they've won 20 consecutive Olympic hockey games.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  See, look.  The Canadians are celebrating.  And then they keep going to the Americans.  They're just crying, weeping on the ice.  We've worked so hard, Bill.  I feel like I'm holding it.  And hold on.  Pat's up again.  Look, you're taking the gold.  We fought so hard.  And getting a gold medal is a great accomplishment.  But at the same time, it's heartbreaking just because we worked so hard.  We've got Olympic girls.  We wanted to be the same thing.  Bring back a gold medal to the U.S. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, my God.  But I think Olympic hockey, that's one of the only events, just about one of the only events in the Olympics where a silver medal is like shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, you need the gold.  That's the big win.  Because, I mean, in hockey, there's only a few teams that could really do anything.  Yeah.  You know, you'd have to have a ridiculous upset for anybody else.  They already know there's like four or five teams that, you know, are in the running for the medals. 
[00:08:30]  So, to get the silver, you know, against the Canadians, no, man, you want that fucking gold.  You want to get the gold.  Yeah.  You want to bite down on that gold to make sure it's real.  No one cares who got second for the Stanley Cup.  No.  It's like you got to fucking win.  Same shit, really.  Win it all.  Same shit, yeah.  With hockey, I do believe that.  Hockey.  Maybe eventually it'd be kind of cool to go, you know, look, I got a silver medal.  Well, yeah, I'm sure it's nice when they get home.  Right.  Everyone at the, in their little hometown is like, hey, hey, look at you, big shot. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, the silver.  You know what the difference is?  It's like a hockey game is one team versus another team, where like everything else in  the Olympics, it's like, you know, five people or six people competing for three medals.  Right, yeah.  But like, you lost the game.  Right.  Like, you lost.  You lost.  You didn't win a silver.  You fucking lost the game.  Right.  You lost the big game.  How do you blow a two-goal lead?  Oh, my God.  With five minutes left.  And you should see. 
[00:09:30]  You got to see the empty net thing.  Yeah, that was just.  With an empty net fucking chance.  All I had to do was into the way.  Why'd the girl miss the empty net shot?  Because it was from far away.  Oh, okay.  It wasn't a guarantee.  Oh, it wasn't like right up there.  But it just missed, so.  Aw.  No, that's the question I would ask if I got stuck next to one of them on a plane one  day.  How do you blow a two-nothing lead with five minutes left?  Oh.  Do that.  I don't think you'd be in a long conversation with that girl.  Oh.  Yeah.  So.  Very mean. 
[00:10:00]  Uh.  This is.  Yeah, and like the Americans.  Look, this is from the last Olympics.  It's in the paper today.  Look how sad, you know, the men's team is getting their silver medal.  Getting their silver.  They're just like, bah.  They're all fucking pissed.  Most people, when they win a silver medal at the Olympics, they're just almost as happy.  They're excited.  They're extremely excited.  Doesn't it feel good to win a silver if you're supposed to get nothing and then you win?  Like, you think you're out of it and then you win a silver.  It's like, oh, fuck.  All right, we got something. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  But if you're heavily favored to medal, you know, then you want gold or nothing.  Michaela Maroney wasn't very happy with her silver.  No, she wasn't.  She made that little face.  She went, mm.  Meh.  Oh, that's her.  Yeah.  Mm.  He does look like Pee Wee Herman.  Oh.  It finally hit me.  Thank you.  The paper had to do it, though.  Johnny Weir.  I'm thinking, who the fuck does he look like?  Yeah, a little bit.  Because he wears a lot of makeup.  That pancake makeup.  Look.  Like Pee Wee.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  He looks like Pee Wee Herman.  Pee Wee. 
[00:11:00]  I guess NBC told Johnny Weir that, you know, you could wear the tiere and everything else,  but they drew the line with fur coats, I guess.  That came out yesterday.  I'm sure it wasn't on a gay thing.  It was more on an animal activist thing.  Well, that's probably the excuse.  How to use it.  Right, exactly.  You know, but they just don't like him wearing fur coats.  Oh, I wish they were there to protect me when Mom put me in that fur coat.  It was NBC back then.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Wear a fur coat and get punched? 
[00:11:30]  I guess.  But Namath made it cool.  Yeah.  Namath.  He looked like a fucking idiot during the Super Bowl in his fur coat.  He was wearing a fur coat.  I didn't think it was that big a thing that he was known for.  Right.  But I guess he was.  He looked ridiculous.  Stupid fur coat.  So, the big hockey game today.  Yeah.  At noon.  Oh, boy.  You were wrong about animal rights being more important than religious worship.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, with the throat cutting for the... 
[00:12:00]  Right.  I don't know.  People are...  We took a lot of phone calls yesterday.  Yeah.  We don't need to take a lot of phone calls.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  What about your fucking...  What about your boy de Blasio?  People are picking up on that bit.  I love it.  Your boy de Blasio.  I love it.  He's a little hypocritical.  What a fucking twat.  What's the word you want to use for de Blasio?  A twat?  Commie twat.  Commie twat.  You guys put it in.  Commie twat.  This is a perfect example of what socialists alike, though. 
[00:12:30]  The ruling class.  Right.  They get all the perks, all the wealth, all the...  Whatever they want.  And then they want to put their rules on everybody else.  Right.  And keep them, you know, a little down.  It's a prime example of...  You mean of the staff?  Yes.  Exactly.  I...  Good example.  I just tweeted the front page of the paper, but basically de Blasio, our new mayor, he  wants to make sure less people are getting run over by cars in and around New York City. 
[00:13:00]  It's a benchmark little cause he's got.  I guess we were talking about this a couple days ago, if you were listening, and basically  all sorts of rules he wants to put in place.  20 mile an hour speed limit or something.  25.  25?  Yeah.  He wants cars to only go 25 miles an hour on the city streets.  And he wants to put in a whole bunch of red light cameras.  Right.  And he wants to get more foot patrols out there, you know, catching people jaywalking and not  waiting for the lights to change. 
[00:13:30]  Because I guess we lost just a few extra pedestrians than other years.  The numbers are...  New York City.  They're minuscule in the end.  The amount of cars and the amount of people in this city, it's amazing.  People aren't getting run over by the second.  It sucks if you know those people that are getting, you know, run over by cars.  But the fact is, the number is so ridiculously low considering what goes on every single  day in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, you name it, the rest of the boroughs.  Bronx, Staten Island.  You watch those aerial views of the city streets in fast motion. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And when you see, like, all the people crossing.  Right.  And then the cars are going.  And then the people are going.  And the cars are like, how are people not getting run over?  And no one has patience.  So they step out.  We all step out on the curb and we think we can do a quick sprint and stuff.  You know, if we were following the rules that are already in place, the numbers would be  way lower.  But for some reason, he has this initiative to really ramp it up.  That's it.  Ramp it up.  Because he cares.  Yeah, bullshit.  And we said on this very fucking show that it's all bullshit. 
[00:14:30]  Yep.  And it's just another way to get another revenue stream coming in for the city.  I think all new politicians, when they come in, I think one of their first things they  try to figure out is a new revenue stream.  Yeah.  So they could get more money coming in, whether it is to make the budget look a little healthier,  because to balance the budget at this point is ridiculous, right?  Yep.  Or to get, you know, more funds and money coming in so they could, like, throw it towards some  programs.  Throw it to programs that their buddies are running anyway.  It's all a bunch of shite. 
[00:15:00]  But, oh, de Blasio, was he, he was caught being naughty.  And now you say he, it's his drivers.  Right.  He has a two SUV caravan.  Right.  Going down the street.  And I guess CBS News decided to follow him with a camera.  Yep.  What a bunch of pricks.  Good for them.  Yeah.  Oh, believe me, it's great.  Good for them.  This is what they should be doing.  Right.  They followed his caravan to see, you know, the driving habits.  And they caught a few faux pas along the way. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  Speeding.  Mm-hmm.  Violating traffic laws, such as not stopping at stop signs, not using directionals.  Mm-hmm.  And what was some of the speeding violations?  60 in a 45 zone.  60 in a 45?  Right.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  And he's the mayor.  He could say to the guy, look, do not break any laws.  And the guy wouldn't.  Well, the reason CBS followed him is simple. 
[00:16:00]  Everyone knows that the politicians don't follow any of the rules of the road.  No.  So they knew they had something.  They knew he wasn't going to follow the rules of the road.  And, you know, especially with all this stuff coming down this week to make it, you know, safer for people.  They knew they had something.  Yeah.  They had no doubt he was going to break, you know, traffic laws.  But it just shows these politicians are all full of shit.  Yeah.  It's all bullshit in the end.  Uh-huh.  Should we play the news story or do some reading here, Sam Roberts? 
[00:16:30]  Um, well, I mean, if you could play the news story just so you can watch the car move.  Yeah.  I like hearing some clips.  And can we put this clip up on our Facebook page?  Fuck yeah.  And our Twitter, too.  O&A show.  O&A show for both.  Okay.  I love these.  Yeah, start over there.  Tonight, it's a CBS2 exclusive, blowing through stop signs, doing 20 miles over the speed limit.  Our cameras capture Mayor Bill de Blasio's driver pulling dangerous moves just two days after the mayor called for safer city streets.  Good evening.  I'm Christine Johnson.  And I'm Maurice Dubois. 
[00:17:00]  It's the kind of driving that would cost most of us our license.  So what does the mayor's office have to say tonight?  CBS2 political reporter Marsha Kramer broke the story, and she has the video.  You'll see only here.  Mayor Bill de Blasio's car blew through a stop sign.  Wow, not even stopping.  And committed various other motor vehicle infractions just two days after he announced a massive Safe Streets campaign.  Did he practice what he preached?  Not today he didn't, which flew in the face of what he said at his street safety press conference about accepting personal responsibility to keep the streets safe. 
[00:17:30]  Oh my God, he's singing in and out of traffic.  Did you see that?  Oh, yeah.  We put a very bold plan before you.  And we want the public to know we're holding ourselves to this standard.  That was Mayor de Blasio as he passionately proposed a street safety plan to prevent traffic deaths that included reducing the speed limit from 30 to 25 and slowing cabbies down, too.  Problem is his two-car caravan.  He was in the lead SUV passenger seat driven by a member of his NYPD security detail. 
[00:18:00]  Red light.  Let's see what he does.  And he couldn't put the brakes on the white and violations of a member of traffic laws.  For example, he went through this stop sign and this one.  Without even tapping on the brakes.  As I followed him, I saw his cars go 40 to 45 in a 30 and much faster as I passed this sign, declaring a 45 miles per hour speed limit.  Going 16 to 45.  16 to 45.  If it was written up for all of these violations today, the driver could lose his license on points. 
[00:18:30]  Driving or rolling through a stop sign is three points on your license.  Doing it twice is three more points.  Six.  Going 10 miles over the 30 mile an hour speed limit is three points.  Two more.  You got two more.  Going 15 miles per hour to 45 miles per hour speed limit is four points.  The grand total for all violations having been handed out is 13.  Your license can be suspended if you rack up just 11 points.  That's not all I found.  Cars changing lanes without signaling.  And when the mayor got back to City Hall, he stayed in his SUV in the parking lot, leaving his chase car unable to enter the plaza. 
[00:19:00]  It blocked the intercession and the crosswalk.  Good for them.  And pedestrians had to walk around it.  The mayor's press secretary, Phil Walczak, issued a statement saying, quote,  We believe public safety is everyone's responsibility.  We also recognize NYPD's training and protocols, and we refer questions related to security and transportation to them.  Pass the fuck.  NYPD also responded, saying the personnel assigned to the mayor's security detail receive specialized training based on security and safety. 
[00:19:30]  Right, right.  That's what they're going to say.  They may include the use of techniques such as maintaining speed with the general flow of traffic,  and they may sometimes include tactics to safely keep two or more police vehicles together.  Oh, shut up.  NYPD also said that the handling of those vehicles is determined solely by the police.  But there was no comment on why the detail went through two stop signs.  I'm Marcia Kramer, CBS News.  This is why politicians are hateable.  And Mark's exclusive story has blown up on social media. 
[00:20:00]  Good.  That's awesome.  No surprise whatsoever.  No.  None.  It's a fucking sack of shit.  But that's what makes people hate politicians.  It's weird little shit like that that makes you hate their guts.  Yeah.  Me and I were talking before the show about this, and, you know, we all know they do this.  We see these caravans flying through Manhattan all the time.  But he's not even smart enough to go, okay, look, let's obey all laws.  Because a mere two days ago, I presented this whole thing. 
[00:20:30]  Let's do this for, like, two weeks.  Let's do it.  We're going to have to do this for a couple weeks, and then we can go back to what we usually do.  That's how they drive the mayor around in this city.  We all know that.  It's always been that way.  But he's not smart enough to just, like, say, all right, let's chill for a little while.  If he's in the front passenger seat with his cop driver, and he doesn't lean over and say,  Hey, dude, what are you doing?  Right.  You're going to get me fucked over here. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  Then he doesn't care.  And that's just it.  He doesn't give a shit about the safety initiative.  No, of course not.  Could you see a pedestrian fucking stepping out while he's doing 60 miles an hour?  Or 45 in a 30 and getting hit?  Holy shit!  That would have been fucking unbelievable.  And they have no sirens on, so they're not behaving like a professional vehicle.  If they had sirens on, that's one thing.  That would be a police thing, but they don't.  It could have been anyone else in those SUVs.  And they will defer it to security reasons. 
[00:21:30]  Like, well, we can't drive like everybody else because, you know, we've got to keep the vehicle caravan together.  So one guy can't stop for the other guy.  It's a security risk to the mayor.  It's such bullshit.  And politicians just can't take responsibility.  No.  How about De Blasio steps forward and goes, ah, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Oops.  Whoopsie.  You're right.  Was that wrong?  Yeah.  Should I have not done that? 
[00:22:00]  Let's say hi to Eddie in Virginia.  Eddie!  Eddie!  Let's shoot this fucker.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Eddie.  Hello, Ed.  Does Marsha Kramer sound like she had either a hair lip or had a stroke?  Both.  She's always sounding like that.  Yeah.  She's got a ghoulish way about her.  Yeah.  She's like one of those old school reporters.  I'm a journalist.  I didn't sleep my way to the top.  She's been.  Yeah, obviously is right.  She's been hitting the streets for a long time. 
[00:22:30]  She fucked her way to using a GoPro in traffic.  Yes.  Yeah, not quite the pinnacle of her trade.  Right.  Later, boys.  Thank you.  Later.  All right, Eddie.  That's great, though.  They're like, hey, you know what?  Who came up with that?  By the way, it's like, all right, the mayor's got this fucking, you know, traffic thing and  everything.  Hey, let's follow him around and see if he's fucking.  Yeah, this wasn't a coincidence.  Uh-huh.  They, they, someone had a really good idea at CBS, too.  They said, we all know they blow all traffic laws, so this would, this would be great. 
[00:23:00]  Let's follow him.  They were at that press conference, whatever he was doing that day.  Yep.  Yesterday.  And said, no, man, let's follow him.  You know damn well they're not going to obey the law, and then we're going to have a nice  little exclusive for our channel.  And they must have been like, oh, this is great.  Look, he's speeding.  Oh, he just blew the stop sign.  Oh.  The video shows him going through two stop signs without even tapping on the brakes.  No.  You don't see brake lights for us, not even for a split second.  And he does that thing I fucking hate, where they straddle the dotted line, deciding what 
[00:23:30]  lane they're going to be in.  No blinker, no nothing.  Right.  And then just ooze over into one of the lanes.  But then he moved back over.  Yeah.  He was kind of like.  Zigging and zagging.  He was zigging and zagging and cutting off a few people.  Yeah.  And again, de Blasio at any time, he's the boss.  You could turn around and just say, hey, what are you doing?  Yeah, this is horrible.  Use your fucking blinker.  Stop at a stop sign.  You're going to get me fucking screwed here.  I think we're going to end up having a lot of fun with this de Blasio guy.  I think so.  I really do.  I think he's a real hypocritical piece of shit. 
[00:24:00]  I pointed out.  Damn it.  I don't think he cares about people like he likes to make everyone believe.  No.  Because I pointed out a simple one.  When that first snowfall hit and he was shoveling his sidewalk in his walkway, although his  son did the walkway, everyone had to know that, he didn't shovel his neighbor's sidewalk.  No, that's his responsibility.  But he had all those cameras there.  And it would have been a perfect opportunity to go, look, we all, as New Yorkers, we should 
[00:24:30]  be helping each other out.  Help each other.  But that line stopped right at the end of his property.  Yep.  And I, there was something about that.  I'm like, man, this guy, this guy is throwing some bullshit at us.  He's a little selfish.  It's a subtle thing, obviously, but maybe not so subtle if you got all the cameras there.  That's how the guys running the show always operate.  It just, you know, it doesn't apply.  It doesn't apply to me.  Right.  I'll make a bunch of rules that you have to adhere to, but I'm not going to do it. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  It just makes them, that little shit makes them so hateable.  Yeah.  Like, like, you just hate his guts.  Yes.  Especially the way, like, if you were to come out and go, all right, you know, like, and  just made fun of it somehow, no one thinks you're going to get a ticket.  No.  Remember when Corzine was in that accident, that stupid accident?  Yeah.  He went, like, 90.  And he gave himself a ticket for, and he got the ticket for not having the, it's one  of those dumb things, but there's something about this that makes you just want to fucking  spit on the guy. 
[00:25:30]  Corzine fucked himself up.  Wow.  How did he end up fucking?  But he was lucky to be alive.  Remember all the injuries he had?  Yeah.  And now he's like in all kinds of.  That's the governor of Jersey at the time.  He's embroiled in all kinds of financial.  They all are.  Improprieties.  Oh, is he?  Yeah, yeah.  He's in, he's in some shit.  They all are.  People ask me all the time.  My, my answer is I don't like any of these guys.  I probably would lean, if it was a clean system, I probably would lean a little Democrat.  They're all shamsters.  But I don't like all, any of them. 
[00:26:00]  I don't believe in any of them.  That's why House of Cards, great show.  Yeah.  It's fucking great.  It's a, it really does, I think it's a very accurate depiction of those scumbags.  It's fucking great.  Kevin Spacey's hilarious.  Well, that's your boy, De Blasio.  Good boy.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  I'm hammering him on Twitter.  I had a good one.  Oh.  I said, I wonder if De Blasio, New York City will play Grand Theft Auto or just drive like it. 
[00:26:30]  Ah, that's a good one.  Oh, shit.  That is a gem.  You got us right.  Now I'm worried.  You got us right, Twitter.  Oh, God, I hope so.  Oh, yes, I do.  I just, is it Bill?  From your Twitter.  I got it.  But that's the right one, right?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, Bill De Blasio.  Bill De Blasio.  He has two different Twitters.  They're both verified.  Yeah.  Wait, two different ones?  Yeah, he's got Bill De Blasio, and then I think he's got like De Blasio NYC or something.  But do they both tweet the same thing? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  I mean, they're both tweeting.  Zath is the mayor's office has their own Twitter.  Which one has the numbers?  I think the Bill De Blasio one.  This one is just 50,000 followers?  That's it.  Bill De Blasio has 72,000.  Oh, man.  Why does he have two?  What a pompous ass.  Why do you have three?  Ow!  I only have one.  Oh.  Fuck.  Oh, yeah.  That's right, but he's not Chip De Blasio.  I'm driving like crazy or something.  Wait, it's not De Blasio NYC? 
[00:27:30]  That's verified.  That's one.  Is that a good one, though?  Yeah, I mean, it's fine.  He just has two.  Yeah.  Yeah, but which one has more followers?  Bill De Blasio.  Fuck!  Yeah, the Bill De Blasio one.  You gotta follow that one.  So that whenever he posts something, you can fucking retweet it with some bullshit about  how fucking douchey he is.  How bullshit he is.  That's what I do.  Right.  Oh, really?  Huh?  Haters.  Haters.  Haters. 
[00:28:00]  He's a big boy, that guy.  Yeah, he's pretty tall.  He's a very tall, big guy.  Most tall people are assholes.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Great bumper sticker.  Absolutely.  Think about it in your own life.  Just think about it.  I don't know what that is.  They just maybe feel like they have power over everyone else because they're taller than  them.  They could probably kick your ass.  Yeah.  Got the reach on you.  Sure.  We should take a break.  We got our food in front of us. 
[00:28:30]  We did most of our material already, so.  Oh, man.  Good luck listening to this crap today.  No, we got a little bit of...  Oh, Ty's coming in today?  Yeah.  Your boy Ty Weston.  Yeah.  He's got a movie coming out.  Okay.  You're a good guy.  A big event.  Yeah.  Yeah, the final...  That's right.  The way off.  The final way off today.  That is the big way off.  With Dr. Ian Smith.  Oh, boy.  And...  Where's our fucking blunders?  Is there some controversy?  I gotta be honest. 
[00:29:00]  There's significant animosity from two parties.  Wow.  Towards Dr. Ian Smith.  Unbelievable.  Eric is not...  He's not happy with them behind the scenes.  Oh, man.  What happened?  I thought they kind of came back together a little bit.  And I quote...  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  His fucking diet doesn't work.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Oh!  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, let's say, for the sake of legalities, Eric's experience with it hasn't been very  great.  That's why that's in Eric Nagel. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Yeah, but Eric's not saying it on the radio.  You can't say it doesn't work.  Let's just say maybe Eric didn't do it properly.  All right.  We're talking to Eric after the break.  And we gotta pump him up.  He can't puss out.  Well, this is...  This would make really good radio.  Oh, he's gonna puss out.  If he confronts Dr. Ian Smith about this...  He'll puss out.  Yeah.  Eric will not go after him.  He says he's not going to puss out.  All right.  All right.  And I'm sure Roland was stress-eating yesterday.  Why?  Oh, my God.  Because of our meeting. 
[00:30:00]  Right?  Even though there was no issues with Roland, but he likes to just spin everything into  some kind of fucking stress ball.  First of all, Roland got the biggest laugh of anyone in the meeting yesterday.  Right.  When he was like, I don't...  I take...  He just...  And then we make up.  He just fell apart.  He fell apart.  He panicked.  It was great.  And it wasn't even a confrontation.  No.  It really wasn't.  I mean, there was no one who was mad at Roland.  But I heard he...  Oh, it was so funny.  He just lost it after that. 
[00:30:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Well, it's Roland.  Roland is convinced something bad is going to happen at every moment of the day.  Yeah, the takeaway apparently from the meeting was that that was a meeting about Roland not  doing things properly.  Of course.  That's what he thinks about everything.  But it really wasn't about...  No.  It was just at all.  He was here at 5 o'clock in the morning this morning.  Oh, no.  Was he?  Like, oh, Roland, what are you doing here at 5 o'clock in the morning?  Here.  And Roland goes, Tim said everybody needs to get here on time. 
[00:31:00]  Prison.  Prison.  Prison.  Roland, I mean, no one's unfireable.  But Roland is so good at his job.  He's great.  He would really have to fuck up to get fired.  How about we tell him that another 100 times and maybe it'll sink in finally.  I kind of like this, though, because I like a panicked Roland because then he goes after  the guys we want more vigorously.  I like a panicked Roland.  I like him frightened and feeling like a whipped, wet animal.  On edge. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the weigh-in is today.  Yes.  Nice.  And Roland, this morning, was very confident.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  And he went rogue.  He's not even using Dr. Ian Smith's diet.  He did.  He went off book.  And I went rogue because, you know, Dr. Ian Smith never sent his blender.  He never sent out one blender.  You know how many Nutribullets I have sold for the company?  That could have been Dr. Ian Smith's blenders.  Can you check his website and see if his blender's reading up and out yet?  Is it still available? 
[00:32:00]  Maybe he's having a production issue.  Like, maybe they're not done.  Really?  By the way, somebody Twittered, how come the mayor's highly trained security didn't notice  cars trailing them all day at high speeds?  Exactly.  Bravo to that person.  Oh, man.  Yeah, because the CBS truck has the logo right on it.  Or truck, whatever the hell they're using.  They would know.  Oh, that's funny.  They were being followed.  That's really funny.  Because they don't care in the end.  No.  That's your answer. 
[00:32:30]  No.  I'm still reading the papers.  Oh.  I was chatting with that too much that I fucking didn't read these papers yet.  Seeing what else.  What's in the news?  Bernie Getz has a dopey rant.  I'll have to read that break.  I don't know.  Love that.  All right, we're going to eat.  Anniversary Opie and Anthony Radio Gem.  Razor all aboard, Scooter.  These damn things are all over Manhattan.  It's the hottest product this summer. 
[00:33:00]  You probably have seen them by now.  Get the hell out of here with that thing now.  Christ.  Or go online.  He's bringing back in memory.  If every neighborhood had the kid.  Yeah, with dad raking, he'd be like.  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  If you want to drive, your dogs are complete and Saturday. 
[00:33:30]  Go to Razor.  I can't laugh.  Knock it off.  Get inside.  Get inside.  If you come down here with that goddamn scooter one more time, I'm calling the cops. 
[00:34:00]  My God.  Get inside.  Get inside.  God damn it.  He's going to give them a goddamn heart attack.  Call the cops, Henry.  Call the cops.  I'm calling the cops, you son of a bitch. 
[00:34:30]  All right, calm down, Chester.  Calm down.  Stop.  I.B.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it. 
[00:35:00]  Stop it.  Sit.  Stop it!  The choke collar.  They got him by the choke chain.  I can't even tell. 
[00:35:30]  Jesus Christ, knock it off, he's gonna die. Call the goddamn police out.  What the hell is going on?  The goddamn animal from across the way, his mother don't give too crap, cause she's never around.  He's got that brand new scooter for Christ's sake, and they want to chase it out.  Knock it off! Knock it off! 
[00:36:00]  They're rich.  I'm free, it's mead!  And they pee, but they're done.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Nice, little Supernaught.  Oh, I like this. 
[00:36:30]  I've never heard this before.  Stop buying four.  David Geffen, huh?  71.  Who's the one, uh, who's the asshole in the, uh, music business from the Eagles documentary?  Is it Geffen?  Um, Sandy Gallon, David Geffen?  Geffen's the biggie, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Hey, Gallon's the manager.  I finally, uh, finished the Eagles documentary. 
[00:37:00]  It was pretty good.  You guys haven't seen it yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  And all I want to do today is sing Smuggler's Blues.  Smuggler's Blues.  Smuggler's Blues.  They went over there like solo careers before they came back together again.  Mmm.  And I think it was Geffen.  Uh, Don Henley and Geffen didn't get along when Henley had that amazing solo career and  then he saw that the support behind him was kind of waning a bit. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  So, he wanted out.  So, Geffen turned around and, uh, sued him for 30 million dollars.  Oof.  Geffen, I think it's Geffen.  Oof.  I hope I'm right.  Comes across like a complete asshole in this documentary.  Yeah.  He is a powerful guy.  I understand that.  I understand that.  Wow.  Yeah.  He's had his hand in everything.  Yeah.  We got to get clips from that documentary.  It was pretty good.  I want to see it.  Oh yeah, Roland gave it to us.  How much this week?  The second half wasn't as good as the first half.  No. 
[00:38:00]  First half, you know, seeing how they, you know, came together and how they figured  out all these classic songs that we all know.  And then they fall apart.  And then 1980, they, uh, can't stand each other anymore.  And then 14 years later, they get back together.  And I believe they're still touring to this day.  That's crazy.  That means they've been back together 20 years.  A lot of cash.  Yeah.  The, the hell freezes over album.  I was on a fucking, because of that documentary we talked about, I was on a, uh, boys of summer  loop where I forgot about that song. 
[00:38:30]  And I'm like, fuck me.  That reminds me of being 15.  And like, that was what they played in every movie.  Had that boys or something, whatever.  And I'm fucking watching girls sing covers of it.  And I found the version that he did in live aid in 1984 or 85.  And I tweeted, it's the best awful stage movement by a band ever.  The only thing worse is Neil Sedaka.  Wow.  What did he do wrong?  It was traveling.  Don Henley's dancing around a little bit? 
[00:39:00]  Dude, it's fucking, Don Henley is, the singing is pretty good, but Don Henley's dancing and  the band's movements, it's fucking cringeworthy.  Oh, I might have to see this.  At Live Aid.  We have to see that.  It's not as bad though, again, as, uh.  I forgot how much I like Don Henley's voice.  It's really good, man.  I was a huge fan of, uh, Boys of Summer, End of the Innocents, uh, New York Minute.  He had a lot of great little, little songs as a solo artist.  He's got, he's got amazing range.  Dirty Laundry.  And that slight rasp to it. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, right.  Which you usually don't get with a high voice, so it, it really is unique.  I met him once in Rochester.  Sounds good.  I was like starstruck.  Yeah.  I got a, I got an old picture of me and Don Henley from like 19, fuck, 80, 87, 88.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you see some of the stage dancing?  He sounds okay in this, but his fucking dancing is horrendous.  You know what it is?  He's a drummer, so he's usually playing and singing.  He's not a front man. 
[00:40:00]  No.  He's just rocking back and forth.  Never snap your fucking fingers.  That's the same thing that Ringo did at the grandkids.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  These drummers, they don't know how to move.  Exactly.  They don't know how to move.  Just sit behind something stupid.  The band is great, too.  Nobody down the beach.  I feel it in the air.  The summer's out of reach.  Empty lake, empty streets.  The sun goes down on.  I'm driving by your house. 
[00:40:30]  Oh no, you're not home.  I can see you.  The brown skin shining.  Oh, my God.  The choreography with the guitarist.  How terrible is that?  It gets worse.  Really?  Oh.  You will still be strong.  After the boys of summer have gone.  He's got a really good voice, man.  Now they're all moving.  Oh, he's doing the... 
[00:41:00]  Oh, it's so awful.  It's almost that Bruce Springsteen dance.  Yeah.  What song is that?  With Courtney Cox in the video.  Dancing in the dark.  Dancing in the dark, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And Bruce did that little snap, hand swing thing.  Look at the one hitting this.  Look at how terrible their movements are.  They look constipated.  That one woman looks constipated.  That really is bad.  She looked almost like Elaine.  Some Seinfeld dances.  It's horrible.  She's gonna be Elaine.  Right.  Look at the maracas girls.  The girls are the best in the back.  Paul Stanley. 
[00:41:30]  What are they doing?  They're doing like a zombie stiff dance over their arms.  The girls are the best in the back.  Okay.  How are they doing?  The girl's doing like a zombie stiff dance over the house.  The girls are the best in the back.  I can tell you why the view will still be strong.  Oh.  The voice is cracking there.  He was on the side of the night.  I can tell you why the view will still be strong.  She's helping him out on the vocals. 
[00:42:00]  He's having a little trouble with that one.  The girl is helping him out.  How many millions of people are watching live?  Yeah.  Look at him.  Oh, the fucking...  It's horrendous stage movement.  They all look like Vic Mars.  That is really bad.  I've never seen a whole band stink so bad moving.  They're just rocking out.  Super dramatic movements.  But he doesn't know what to do.  You're right. 
[00:42:30]  Because he's a drummer.  He's just swaying his head from side to side.  How good did the chick hit those?  Oh, she's good.  What a great find.  Yeah, this is...  You can Google up Boys and Summer from Live Aid.  What a great find.  What is he doing?  A little voice inside my head said,  Don't look back, you can never look back.  That girl looks like she's dancing a tech noir from Terminator. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  That's really mad.  Nice jean jacket, Dick.  Oh, it's terrible.  Oh, there they go.  Now they're rocking.  Now they're rocking.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  I bet Don would love a nice sip of water right about now.  Yeah.  His throat's doing that burning thing.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  You think he knows it's cracking a little?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He could just be having a hard time. 
[00:43:30]  Now he's trying a little falsetto to cover up.  He probably just had a shitty voice that day, unfortunately.  That could be it.  Because he's...  I've seen him, like...  No, he could pull his song off.  He pulls everything off.  No, he's got some kind of laryngitis or something.  But being a singer, that's one thing about the singer.  It's a motherfucker, man.  Yeah.  You get a cold or something, and you'll get...  Yeah, you're fucked.  Oh, there they go.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him facing the drummer.  Look at his movements.  Oh, look at the girl's back.  He's stiff-legged in it.  Dude, he's just rocked.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's stiff-legged in it. 
[00:44:00]  How terrible is that?  He's, like, facing the drummer, just rocking back and forth, snapping.  It's good.  Oh, they're the bestie people.  Oh, yeah.  The Moroccas.  The Moroccas.  The Moroccas.  The Moroccas.  The Moroccas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Moroccas.  And the tambourine.  Fucking Juan Epstein with the Moroccas.  He's great.  Oh.  Look at his legs lifting up.  Oh, the guitar fucking guy is moving.  They are doing every 80's cliche move. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, Henley moves shitty.  Oh, he's mocking the drum sound.  Now he's doing a little air drumming.  Please watch this.  That's pretty bad.  That's really funny.  We'll put it on our Facebook page.  Yeah.  Oh, and a show on Facebook.  That's good.  That farm.  Thank you.  That was farm aid.  That was farm aid.  That was farm aid.  Farm aid.  Farm aid.  I think the problem was Don Henley, like you said, when he was in the Eagles and stuff,  he wasn't officially the front man, so he could play and sing at the same time, but  when he went solo, he was forced to now stand in front of everybody, and he had no experience 
[00:45:00]  doing that, obviously.  He looks like a douche.  He looked extremely uncomfortable.  Damn.  That was funny.  That was a BAB favorite, huh?  Boys of Summer?  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  That was a huge song.  Huge hit.  Huge song.  Some Don Henley. 
[00:45:30]  I love Classic Rewind.  It's one of my favorite channels on SiriusXM.  I listened to that one on SiriusXM.  Hey, that's really good, guys.  You're cross-promoting the other stations on the platform.  Somewhere right now, Denny's coming.  Oh, yeah.  Just loving the fact that we're cross-promoting.  He's screaming, finally.  That is a good one.  No, because Classic Rewind is like new classic rock, if that makes sense.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like all that stuff that is now 20 years old.  Yep.  You know, you're going to get your Asia.  You're going to get your Don Henley solo stuff.  Mm-hmm.  You know what channel I really like?  Yeah.  You're going to get your Asia.  You're going to get your Don Henley solo stuff.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I mean?  It's like all that stuff that is now 20 years old.  Yep. 
[00:46:00]  You know, you're going to get your Asia.  You're going to get your Don Henley solo stuff.  Mm-hmm.  You know what channel I really like?  And I don't know any of the fucking songs.  It's Lil' Steven's Garage.  Oh, the garage fucking thing he does there.  I fucking love that channel.  And I don't know any of this shit.  I need to kind of be a little familiar with some of these songs that I hear on the radio.  Usually I have to be that way too, but...  It's like, ooh, this song. 
[00:46:30]  I love it, man.  Ooh.  I can't really promote it properly, because like I said, I don't know any of these bands  or anything, but it just has that garage band sound.  Yeah.  Like, he'll play songs by the Kinks you've never heard before, and you go,  why the fuck was this never on the radio?  I wasn't a big Kinks fan either.  No?  No.  No.  A little whiny.  We went through a Kinks stage, me and my pals in high school.  A little too whiny. 
[00:47:00]  It was pretty simple.  A little celluloid hero.  No?  Celluloid hero.  Maybe a couple of their hits.  But you go a little...  Lola?  You go off their hits, and I'm just like, nah.  No, but then they're on that garage channel.  Pretty cool.  Yeah, I'm kind of lost.  Yeah, I don't like one or two Kinks songs, I don't know any of their catalog at all.  Yeah.  No, they got some great stuff, but a lot of the stuff fell short of getting massive radio  play.  I just don't like...  I don't know.  The vocals on there are always a little weird. 
[00:47:30]  They always seem just a little off.  Really?  You didn't like the Kinks?  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  You picked a shitty song.  Well, they just seem a little off.  Like, he's not really hitting the notes very well.  He's a little crackly, nasally.  He's got a weird voice.  Go to the garage channel.  Could you get a playlist somehow?  Uh, yeah.  Ooh.  Little Steven knows how to pick songs.  Although I doubt he's picking anything.  Yeah, what is he doing?  He's got that lily hammer.  He's got Bruce. 
[00:48:00]  What's he doing?  Picking songs?  I don't think so.  It's called Underground Garage?  All right.  Danny probably does it.  Find a Kinks song that he'd play on there.  Let's just go cold.  If it's possible.  They don't give you a playlist.  Ugh.  They should just give you, like, some of the songs they play on this channel.  Do we have to do everything?  We're listening live?  What?  How long are we going to have to listen until they play a Kinks song?  Right.  Pet Shop Boys.  What?  Pet Shop Boys are going to be on Alcube? 
[00:48:30]  On Alcube?  Right.  That seems like a party waiting to happen.  Yeah.  Didn't they do that song?  Rear End Boys and West End Girls?  Rear End Boys?  No?  It wasn't a joke.  Wait.  What is that song?  West End Boys and West End Boys and West End Girls or something.  I'm so stupid.  I thought it was Eastern Boys and a Western Town?  No, that's a different song.  I'm wrong.  I don't know.  Wait.  Wait. 
[00:49:00]  What was the Pet Shop Boys song?  What was the name of it?  Uh, Go Wet?  No.  Uh.  No, what was their?  That was their big hit, wasn't it?  I know, but what was the name of the song?  Anyone?  Anyone?  I think it was West End Girls.  Yeah, it was called West End Girls.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Fuck the Kings, because it's taking too long to find it.  Yeah.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  That's right.  Where's Eric?  We're supposed to talk to him.  Yeah, where is E-Rock?  He's ready. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, man.  Where is he?  E-Rock.  So, the final weigh-in today for the Dr. Ian Smith Challenge.  Yeah.  He's got a new book out.  I forgot the name of it.  I guess you'll lose a bunch of weight in a bunch of days or something.  Oh.  20 pounds, 20 days.  Is that the name of the book?  What is it?  I don't know.  Really?  I didn't know.  Oh, boy.  I might have a surprise for E-Rock today. 
[00:50:00]  He was not going to be happy about this surprise.  You don't think it's a good one?  Oh, E-Rock.  Thank you.  You guys can bring it up.  I'm not dealing with it.  Eric.  Oh, wait.  There's E-Rock.  So, you've been on the Dr. Ian Smith diet for how long?  Three weeks?  Four weeks?  Yeah.  It's a month, right?  Yes.  It ran its course.  You're officially done with his diet today.  It ended, technically, his book ended last week.  And what's the name of the book?  It doesn't matter at this point. 
[00:50:30]  Wow.  Well, you should say it because people may or may not have it.  It is called the Super Shred Diet.  Okay.  All right.  Now, I've got to ask, because a lot of people go on diets, and whether they lose weight...  Well, let's say they do lose weight on a diet.  As soon as the diet ends, then they just go back to...  Pack it right back.  They just go back to eating how they used to.  Yep.  What happened when you ended the diet?  Did you go back to eating shitty?  No.  I've actually maintained very well.  Oh.  Good for you. 
[00:51:00]  You've seen...  I've had the...  Thanks to our friends at Nutribullet.  I've been having smoothies almost every day, every other day, spacing it out, as Opie  holds it up to an audience that can't see it.  And...  That's the joke, you idiot.  That was good presenting it, though.  Thank you.  Nice, clean Nutribullet.  And...  Show the product.  You know, I'm...  End of this month is two months without soda, which I did on my own.  That's good.  Wow.  So that's been good.  I lost that craving.  It took a while, but it's gone.  Now, I'm looking at you, and you're not happy with Dr. Ian Smith and his diet, because 
[00:51:30]  we kind of talked about that before the break, but you look like you lost weight.  I lost weight.  I just...  It...  Uh-oh.  It wasn't doing 100% of what it was saying it could do.  I'm not saying that it can't do it, but it wasn't doing it for me.  But let's get extremely honest here.  Okay.  Were you cheating?  No.  It wasn't.  How much exercise?  There was a little gap last week where there wasn't much exercise, but every day...  A little gap in seven days. 
[00:52:00]  A little gap last week, you know, in context with history.  Yeah.  There was a few days where there wasn't an exercise.  But in general, you were exercising?  Yeah.  What kind of exercising?  I have an elliptical at home.  I do about 30 minutes on that.  Do you burst train?  What is that?  Oh, man.  Jesus, Eric.  Oh, Eric.  You've got to go around finding bubbles.  That's all about getting that heart rate up for a minute, and then backing off, letting  your heart go back to normal, and then doing it again. 
[00:52:30]  Ah.  Supposedly, that's way better than just, you know, keeping an even pace.  Well, the computer in the elliptical has a weight loss program that does...  Interval training?  Yeah.  Interval training where you're going up a mountain, then you're walking flat, and it's  doing an incline again.  Yeah, that's similar.  Right.  Good for you.  Going to a gym helped a lot with me, though, because I was in such fucking...  I would plateau a little bit, and just going to a gym and having someone show me helped  a lot.  And then... 
[00:53:00]  So what are the problems with the diet?  Well, the problem was...  Are you going to confront Dr. Ian Smith in a mere 20 minutes from now?  Sure.  The problem I had...  Uh-oh.  What was that?  Sure.  It wasn't confident.  No, it wasn't.  It impacted him involving this problem.  Right.  The third week of the diet takes away everything that the diet was doing for the first two  weeks, because it says in the chapter there, at this point, most people plateau, and they  don't lose any more weight. 
[00:53:30]  Mm-hmm.  So in this, they take away the meals.  So it was just little snacks based on his thing through the day.  So I did the third week.  Same thing with the liquid, fresh squeezed juice, water, green tea, things like that.  Were you losing your mind?  Yeah.  The third week became a big problem.  It can't be like meals.  You just gotta...  Yeah, because you...  And then, but the fourth week, you're back to four meals a day.  So you went from nothing to...  Alright, this sounds crazy. 
[00:54:00]  ...overdoing it again.  Is it trying to shock the system?  Yeah, is what it's trying to do.  Like, sometimes they say...  Like, I've had trainers tell me that once in a while a cheat day is okay, because your  system works really hard to make up whatever the fuck it does, and then you get right back  to the exercise.  Like, it kicks your system into...  Yeah, as long as you don't do it often.  Yeah, I forget what the explanation was.  Hmm.  There was no...  I look at relationships like that.  There were no cheat days in this diet, but there are...  When you get to certain meal plans or snack options, you know, like I said, with all 
[00:54:30]  the snacks, first it lists all his products.  And if you don't want to use those, then it says there's a list of 100 calorie snacks  that you can choose from, or 150 calorie snacks you can choose from, and Sawyer would  pick from that.  And then in the meals, he would give you options for, say, meal three.  You can have a five ounce piece of chicken, a five ounce piece of fish.  You can have one slice of lasagna, or you can have two slices of pizza.  And looking at all that, even though it's in the diet, I stayed away from the pasta and 
[00:55:00]  the pizza, even though you were allowed to have it.  Wait, two slices of pizza?  Yeah, like, pretty much like an Elio slice, like a five inch thing, is what they were  measuring out to.  But even though those were options, I stayed away from those as well.  Right.  So it wasn't a fucking two New York City slices of pizza.  No, no, no, no.  Okay.  Muddle.  When he's working it back in so that the diet is not completely miserable, I understand.  But I even picked the better choices out of that.  Right.  And...  So you were hoping to lose... 
[00:55:30]  You pretty much know how much weight you lost.  You don't have to tell us yet.  Yeah.  And you were just hoping to lose more after going through this.  I was hoping to lose more based on this program.  Right.  But I don't think the program itself was a complete failure, if that makes any sense.  That's an endorsement.  Yeah, exactly.  You should put that in the cover there, on the cover.  Right.  It's not a complete failure.  It's not a complete failure.  But maybe it would work if you just kept doing it.  I'm not saying you should, if you found something else.  Yeah.  That probably would be the case, you know, to extend it longer than what the book had said. 
[00:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  But you were going by the book.  I was going by the book.  It was really difficult.  But I did it.  Right.  So I can say, compared to the last diet, which was completely fucking miserable, because  it was like chicken broth and white bean soup all the time, and pickles as a snack, and that  was it.  And...  Yeah.  You did.  That was the...  You can't function.  You get exercise walking your small dog in a robe. 
[00:56:30]  Super smash.  Fat smash.  You can't function doing that.  Right.  It's hard.  Right.  Interesting.  Because you were tired all the time, because you weren't really eating and everything.  This, you're constantly eating little bits through the day.  But, you know, he gives you options to kind of, so it's not so tedious.  Mm-hmm.  I followed it.  I did it.  I did everything that he could.  And I even called him when I said, look, I think I'm at a point where this isn't working  anymore.  Oh.  So he had a guy come over and drop off his workout DVD. 
[00:57:00]  And I tried that twice, and that was done.  Wait, hold on.  Why was the...  He had someone drop off his work.  Okay.  Correct.  Why was the...  Why was...  Why was you on do it twice?  Um...  Okay.  Exercise doesn't really work that way.  No, I understand that, but I'm also not a fan of super high impact in 20 minutes.  Oh, wow.  I was like, come on, let's move, let's move, let's move.  I was not having an easy time keeping up, if at all. 
[00:57:30]  Uh-oh.  Okay, so...  Yeah, because that's...  You gotta start way slower.  Right.  You're not a workout guy in general.  It says, for this portion of certain exercises, he said, for you new people, only do a minute.  The rest of us are gonna do two minutes.  Uh-huh.  And I tried doing the two minutes.  And then that was the first time I tried.  I said, let me see how far I can go with this.  And about halfway through, I go, okay, this isn't working.  I'm going back to the one minute intervals.  Uh-huh.  And it still just got to the point where it was...  But instead of saying it doesn't work, like, maybe that's, if it's really tough to do, 
[00:58:00]  your system just has to kind of adjust to your doing it.  Right.  Like, I'm better now than I was six months ago.  And, you know, it's like, you just don't give up on it.  You just improved.  Well, that's a crazy exercise program.  I mean, I would imagine someone would drop dead of a heart attack if you haven't exercised  before.  Honestly, you felt it about ten minutes into it.  Yeah, that sounds safe.  Where he had a little cool-down period for, like, a minute between each thing.  So even though the workout, I think, was 27 minutes, the entire program's a little longer  because of the breaks and him walking you through this stuff. 
[00:58:30]  But it just got to the point where I was just like, if you were never an exercise person  and jumped into it, this was extremely difficult.  What do they have you doing for, like, two minutes or a minute?  Well, you start off imaginary jump roping for, like, two minutes, which is not that hard.  Okay, that one.  But then you're doing these, he has all these cute names for these exercises, but it's like  you're simulating skiing.  Double Dutch ping.  Skiing.  Really?  I'm not the same for you.  I mean, that's the new exercise. 
[00:59:00]  Let's see.  There's that big jump rope thing.  Because really?  There's a thing where you're simulating ice skating, almost.  Uh-oh.  I can't really do it.  I can't really do it.  But, you know, so you're just constantly, it's almost like a lunge, but you're not going  all the way down.  You're just, yeah, you're doing that and then pivoting on your foot going over there.  Doesn't sound bad yet.  Not bad yet.  You're doing simulated mountain climbing.  You're doing mountain climbing.  You're just standing there going, odly, odly, odly, odly, odly. 
[00:59:30]  You do some deep squats for two minutes.  That's hard.  Then there's...  One of the best exercises you could do, by the way.  Really?  Squatting is good, right?  Yeah.  Um, then there was continuous, um, return to high knee running.  Like, in place where you're running.  High knee running?  Yeah.  That's where you open your asshole and back up quickly into a waiting lucky doorknob.  Dude, you know how hard, high knees, when my trainers call high knees, fucking, if they 
[01:00:00]  want, one of them will ask for a minute and I want to choke her.  Yeah.  The 30 seconds, that's fucking hard.  Right.  Especially when you have a wood floor and you're doing it in socks.  Oh, you're all shaved.  Yeah.  It's very smooth.  Yeah.  That's really hard to do.  Two minutes of high knees is fucking rough.  Um, and then I, this one point here in my notes, um, I forgot what this exercise is,  but it was called the jump lung.  And it was, I think it was a combination of squatting, jumping up, and then jump, uh,  getting down, squatting again, jumping up.  And I just got to the point where I was like, I can't breathe anymore. 
[01:00:30]  I'll getcha.  Two.  So we're calling him right now, but we're trying to get him on the phone.  Two minutes of that jump, like high, we call them high jumps.  And I'll do like maybe 10, sometimes 15 of them.  Yeah.  Fucking brutal.  Two minutes of that, very hard.  All that is very hard.  Yeah.  Just do what you can.  For people trying to get back, you know, in shape and lose weight.  But I, I, I had to try it and I had to do it.  That workout tape is not for you.  I wonder who it's for.  Sometimes when you look at a tape like that, you can still take the exercises and go, okay, 
[01:01:00]  I can't do what Ian Smith is doing, but I can still do 20 seconds or I could do 15  reps of this.  You don't have to do tape.  And that would help.  It's definitely something that progressively you'd be able to do.  Yes.  But within a four week period of just jumping right into that.  And some of it in week four, it was saying doing that twice a day.  So that was just like, this is, I'm going back to the elliptical.  I have a big park near me.  I went, you know, I'm real, you know, what? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, you were grinning.  I thought there was a park.  He's so bad.  Believe me.  I was thinking big, I couldn't get anything.  I was thinking, I did nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was smiling at the mere prospect of being me.  Long walks and everything to kind of change it up and do what I possibly could.  But you don't, you don't have to time it out.  Like, okay, this will be done in a month.  Just realize, all right, it's a long haul.  And I'll just learn these little exercises and start doing them.  And you're right.  And that's why I'm not over, I'm not, I'm not really happy with the way the diet went. 
[01:02:00]  But I'm not upset with everything I did and how it's going to continue.  Because I'm not done.  No.  It's a fucking.  Yeah.  I mean, I saw how long, and you look great in it.  I saw how long it took you to get to where you're at.  And it wasn't, look, I'm realistic.  It's not going to do it in a four week, in a four week spot.  But this thing isn't over.  You're still motivated?  Yeah.  I'm still doing it for you.  I think you should join a gym.  But that helped me a lot.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just going to that day, I walked in the fucking gym I go to, and I was like, I just need to.  Even though they're still fat, I can't get rid of them.  It's motivated.  And you get to see a lot of penises.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Some pussies, too.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, yeah, of course.  Maybe at the fancy gyms.  Maybe at the fancy gyms.  No.  Penises are everywhere.  Oh, every gym's got a good supply of dick.  Especially if you're an old man.  There's something about having your penis out.  I'll never understand that.  Hey, look, show those micrococks.  Right.  He's playing with his belly button.  I'm looking.  Dr. Ian Smith, live on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:03:00]  There he is.  My God, man.  Hello, Dr. Smith.  Good, I'm good.  Hey, guys.  Oh, you have a shitty phone.  Uh-oh.  The phone.  Where are you?  The hotel room, eh?  Maybe we can call him back because we can hardly hear you, sir.  No, for real, you have a horrendous connection.  We can barely hear you.  Hold on a minute.  I'm just putting you on hold.  That's a bad connection right there.  What was that?  It was like, meh.  Roland, what about you?  Boys, I'm fine.  Roly.  Boys, I'm fine.  Of course, you blew off Dr. Ian Smith. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, for Vinnie Tortorishes.  It is confidential.  If you want a diet to work, this is where I go.  I feel fantastic.  I'm not hungry because I had bacon.  You're kidding.  Cheese.  Bacon.  Cheese.  That doesn't sound like a...  I had a delicious meal every day.  Are you kidding?  No.  I was full every day.  I had to take naps.  That was my exercise.  Wow.  Naps and food.  I slipped away and shit it too.  This doesn't sound like a diet at all.  It's like those low carb things where you can eat anything you want but carbs. 
[01:04:00]  I just don't think that's healthy.  All right.  We're going to try Dr. Ian Smith again.  Dr. Ian.  Hey, guys.  Are you ready?  Yeah, way better.  Okay.  So we got E-Rock and Roland in studio.  Today's the big final weigh in.  Yeah.  I know E-Rock followed your latest diet and book.  What's the name of the book again there, sir?  Super Shred.  Super Shred, right.  And then Roland said screw Super Shred after a couple days and he's on another diet. 
[01:04:30]  So this is very interesting.  I think it's confidential.  So...  You guys, let me just...  Before we get started, let me just say a few things if you don't mind, okay?  Uh-huh.  Just make it fun.  First of all, you guys...  You guys know I love you.  Okay?  It's 5 o'clock in the morning in LA here.  I'm doing this because I love you guys so much.  Yeah.  But let me say some things very clear.  First of all, I don't care if people are on the Vinny Testa Verde diet or the Tim Tebow  diet.  I care less about those diets.  If you want to go on those diets and lose weight, I'm happy for you.  Run down Fifth Avenue naked. 
[01:05:00]  I don't care.  Uh-huh.  Don't tweet me about, you're on this diet and, you know, so-so to Super Shred.  Okay, fine.  I mean, this is not like a...  Super Shred is not the only diet in the world.  Happens to be the number one diet in the country, by the way, but it's not the only one diet  in the world.  I don't want those tweets, number one.  Number two, all respect to Rowland.  I'm happy for Rowland.  Rowland needs to lose weight.  If he loses it through surgery, through Vinny Testa Verde, or whoever he loses, I think  there are less...  A real-play shotgun blast.  And lastly, regardless of what E-Rock shows today, E-Rock was a champ. 
[01:05:30]  He stuck to it.  The average weight loss, like I say in the book, is 20 pounds in four weeks.  That's average, guys.  Average means some will lose less, some will lose more.  There you go.  That's my setting right there.  Now let's go.  I hear ya.  I hear ya.  I hear ya.  Okay.  What happened, E-Rock?  Oh, man.  E-Rock...  I just saw a bunch of fuckin' gooey snot come out of E-Rock's nose.  Apparently Eric's allergic to humble pie.  He just lost another pound. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, man.  Wow.  You alright, E-Rock?  What was that?  It just came out of nowhere.  Yeah, that's it.  It came out of your nose.  So, and then E-Rock...  I don't know.  Why don't you talk to Dr. Ian Smith?  Hi, Ian.  I think he kind of, in general, liked the diet.  He had some issues, but...  For history's sake, this all started because E-Rock had a problem with Dr. Ian from years 
[01:06:30]  ago from the last one.  Right.  And Dr. Ian came in here and ingeniously turned the whole thing around and got E-Rock back  on another diet challenge almost in the exact same scenario that he was in the first place.  Exactly.  With the money and the...  Right.  We got it.  Okay.  Thanks for recapping.  So talk to Dr. Ian Smith.  So Ian, as you know, I had been in touch with you.  I've been following the diet pretty much verbatim. 
[01:07:00]  Even not doing some of the choices that you gave in the diet.  Like when certain options had lasagna or pizza or things like that, I didn't do any  of that stuff.  Okay.  Did the exercise and I got to a point where it just wasn't working anymore, which I reached  out to you and you had a guy send me your high impact workout.  So I tried that and like you said, it's very difficult and if you can only do one minute 
[01:07:30]  portions of the exercise, try that.  I did all that.  I did all that.  It really kicked my ass to the point where it was extremely difficult to do it.  You weren't able to complete some of the exercises, right?  When I was doing it, no.  Wow.  I got through the first half hour and almost died when I tried.  I'm sorry, I didn't get through the first half hour and I almost died.  The second time I did it, I went through the whole half hour on the disc there and was  really just laying there on the floor. 
[01:08:00]  Is that workout tape for, obviously it's not for everyone, Dr. Ian Smith.  Well, hold on for a second.  First of all, it's a 27 minute workout, which is why it's called the Shred 27 Burn.  So it's not a half hour, it's only 27 minutes.  The workout is for all levels of fitness, whether you're a beginner or in advance.  And the idea is very simple.  You do as much of the 27 minutes as you can do.  And the reason why the program is so effective is because it's called High Intensity Interval  Training Workout.  And with this workout, you can burn more calories in 27 minutes than someone doing 
[01:08:30]  a steady state exercise for an hour, for example, walking on a treadmill.  So it's High Intensity Energy Burst Workout, but everyone can't do the full 27 minutes.  I just did it with Rachel Ray, for example, last week on TV.  And she did about 80% of it, okay?  Because it's not easy, but whatever you can do of it, you're going to get some great  effect from it.  So it's okay, Iraq can do all of it, but just try to do as much of it as you can.  And people at home can do it too.  Oh, man.  You don't have to go crazy. 
[01:09:00]  Just do as much as you can.  Just do what you can.  Just do what you can.  Right.  And then tomorrow you try to do a little more.  Just do what you can.  And then before you know it, you're like, wow, I could do a little more now after a couple  of weeks.  You're like, oh, look at that.  Let's go to Roland, even though he's not on the Dr. Ian Smith plan.  Roland, how was your exercise during your weight loss?  I had a Natala.  It was fantastic.  Do it.  And I walked and saw New York.  What did you eat?  I had delicious, from fish to steak, to all the living animals I pretty much ate. 
[01:09:30]  And you were eating bacon?  Bacon?  Every morning.  And a cheese omelet.  Yes, sir.  That sounds impossible.  Dr. Ian Smith, how do you feel about a diet that allows you to eat bacon every morning?  Well, if I were a cardiac surgeon, I would love it, because that means I'd have more patients.  You know, this is no clue.  You know, these kind of diets have been around since the beginning of the century where you  can eat all this high-calorie, high-fat, you know, heart-busting kind of diet to lose 
[01:10:00]  weight.  This is nothing new.  Hello.  However, when they crack your chest open because you need, you know, a coronary artery  bypass, then that's a different conversation.  So if people want to think that the best way to lose weight is to have bacon every morning,  you know, come on.  How can you even address, how can I even respond to that with any dignity?  I mean, I've got to do a joke of it, right?  It doesn't make sense to me, like how, like, I guess, like, Atkins.  The dignity.  Couldn't move Atkins.  What, Roland?  Hold on, Roland.  What? 
[01:10:30]  The dignity.  He's doing his Pat Cooper.  Pat Cooper impression.  That was your Pat Cooper?  Yeah.  I try.  My voice cracks.  My bad.  All right.  I digress, Dr. Ian.  What do you think, though, about heart disease and stuff, Roland?  Heart disease, according to Dr. Oz, is some bad shit.  What?  That's why I got Oz.  And he said that he didn't, his exercise was sleeping.  And also I walked.  Because he was so full.  And I walked very fast to the subway in the morning. 
[01:11:00]  And he walks very fast to the subway in the morning.  Oh, okay.  That's a nice strut, I would say.  Right.  Oh, I fell down twice on the ice.  So I moved my abs.  That's the ab exercise when you fall down on the ice?  I hit my ass.  I had to bend down.  Oh, okay.  It hurt.  All right.  Do people like Roland?  I'll be up some good health insurance, man.  Oh, I do.  Sirius provides me with excellent health insurance.  Do people like Roland frustrate you, Dr. Ian Smith?  I mean, it's like, here's my, it's simple stuff.  Like, if someone walks into the street and says, hey, you want to buy a bridge from me? 
[01:11:30]  You're going to look at them like they have five freaking heads.  If someone says, this is how I lost my weight.  I ate steak.  I ate, you know, fried chicken.  I ate chicken every day.  People are like, okay.  All right.  All right.  Next.  So, I mean, you know, it's okay.  Like I said, if the way Roland wants to lose weight, lose weight.  I'm happy for you.  Thank you.  Tim Tebow, Vinny Testaverde.  I'm off.  Oh, yeah.  Tim Tebow.  What?  Tim Tebow's with Good Morning America now.  A little fun fact.  He just threw out a fun fact. 
[01:12:00]  What was this fun fact?  Tim Tebow's with GMA now.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I haven't had breakfast yet.  I'm a little hungry.  What are you going to have?  What are you going to have?  Baking cheese omelette, bitches.  Bacon cheese omelette.  He's going to have a bacon cheese omelette this morning.  That's what I have every day.  Every day.  Yeah.  Why the dislike for Dr. Ian Smith, Ron?  Where does this come from?  I like Dr. Ian Smith.  He encouraged me to go on a diet when he came in.  Certainly did.  But why didn't you follow his diet? 
[01:12:30]  I don't know.  It was tough after two days.  He wanted bacon and cheese omelettes.  If I remember correctly, Roland's original excuse was he didn't have popcorn or a blender,  so the diet became impossible.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  I was still waiting for the blender, by the way.  Then I sent four cases of popcorn and he ate two bags of it.  Oh, man.  I didn't eat the popcorn, Denny did.  Oh, Denny did?  Yeah.  Well, diets are hard.  They are hard.  I mean, you know.  I love desserts.  People like Dr. Ian Smith try to come up with a diet where it's not as much suffering. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  But in the end, you've got to make some kind of sacrifices.  If you're eating right and exercising, that's not an easy thing to do.  Yeah.  Going to the gym and eating butter.  Yeah.  Eating butter.  You guys, I've got so many ONA fans.  By the way, ONA fans are awesome.  I've got so many ONA fans who send me all the results.  Sounded like you said awesome instead of awful.  They're awful.  They're awful.  90% of them are awesome, trust me.  Except for the cowards that are talking about the other diet.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I got it.  These guys have lost so much weight.  I'm super shredded. 
[01:13:30]  They send me pictures and all kinds of testimonials.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You guys are awesome.  And hit me up on Twitter at Dr. D-R-I-A-N-Smith.  Don't hit me up about Vinny Testaveri.  I'm not interested.  Don't waste your time.  Right.  Who cares?  Exactly.  But anyway, these guys are great.  ONA fans have been awesome during this whole time, by the way.  And by the way, remember, you guys, I gave E-Rock 500 bucks.  Right.  Uh-oh.  Ahead of time.  Right.  And we changed it because Roland dropped out.  Right.  We changed the $500 obligation to him losing 20 pounds in four weeks. 
[01:14:00]  That's what we changed it to.  Just to be clear, I want to set the record.  Right.  But there's more than just $500 on the line.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  If you recall.  That really is.  Not just Steve.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Will it be in quarters?  Nickels are dying.  What happened?  I just heard.  Oh, did I just hear what's called anal tightening?  Yes.  Oh, anal tightening. 
[01:14:30]  I have a question to address something somebody said on Twitter.  Okay.  About cheat days.  Because I was saying that once in a while the people have cheat days.  A constant caloric deficit results in a decrease in leptin, which causes fat retention.  Cheat days jumpstart leptin levels.  Does that mean like if you eat really good for a while, then you have a cheat day, it kind  of kicks your system back in?  Yeah.  That's what they call intermittent fasting, where you kind of like you do five days of  really good stuff and a couple of days of like not so great.  And it's believed that it can change your hormone level. 
[01:15:00]  Leptin is one of the hormones.  Leptin is your starvation hormone.  And so leptin lets your body know if your fat stores are at the right level or not.  And so what the person is saying is correct, by the way.  And by the way, that's why in my program-  Fat store called?  And remember, I build in pizza, so sometimes you can have pizza and lasagna.  Okay.  So maybe Iraq should have ate the pizza.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking no leptin having motherfucker.  But it's hard to believe that.  But the problem is your brain fucks you up because you're on a diet and then you have 
[01:15:30]  these, you know, you're allowed to have pizza.  You're allowed to have pizza.  You can't wrap your head around that where that's actually going to help you in the end.  I know it's counterintuitive, but that's why you guys have blind faith sometimes.  I mean, I, I've been doing this for a long time and, and, and, you know, you don't  want to be, I can't, I'm going to say this.  You don't want to be overly perfect on a diet.  You don't.  I mean, you know, diets are built for some imperfections.  That's how I built my diet.  I built, I built it so you guys could be imperfect sometimes.  And everyone tries to be overly perfect. 
[01:16:00]  And then sometimes the science behind the diet, like the guy just wrote about, the  leptin part, won't work.  Hmm.  Okay.  Any final thoughts from Roland or E-Rock before we weigh them for the final time here?  Very exciting.  The big weigh in.  Roland, to you first.  Money on the line.  Dignity.  Dignity.  Yeah.  It's a Vinnie Toterich Fitness Confidential and, uh, I want some bacon.  This guy who, Roland's doing his diet, has to be so frustrated that Roland.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes. 
[01:16:30]  Nobody has any idea what his name is.  I swear to you I, I couldn't spell his name.  I'm looking in this book.  No.  There's no diet tips in this book.  It's just about his life.  No.  It's like his what?  It's a biography.  It's his biography.  Where's the diet in here?  I don't see his diet.  I'm not saying it's not here.  I just don't see it.  I bought the audio version.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's pretty good.  Okay.  No sugars.  Find it.  Alright, so, and E-Rock, any final thoughts before you weigh it?  Devil.  To see if you, uh, get to keep, um, Dr. Ian Smith's $500 that you already have. 
[01:17:00]  And Dopey's $500, right?  Dr. Steve's $100.  Dr. Steve's $100.  Dr. Steve's $100.  Final thoughts?  Yeah.  You're going to enjoy this outcome.  Yay!  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Not again.  Oh, no.  Not again.  Oh, is he predicting failure?  No, I'll tell you.  It's failure.  Why are you telling us failure instead of the big moment when you get on the scale?  Because who gives a fuck about this at this point? 
[01:17:30]  Oh!  Sounds like, uh, Hillary Clinton about Benghazi now.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  Who gives a shit?  Shit.  What does it matter?  This has gone on much longer than it needed to.  But it was a four-week program.  Yes, and we're five weeks and the guy putting up the money isn't here.  Again.  Whoa!  Again!  Wait, he gave you the money already.  No, I know he did.  But we booked him a while ago to come in for the finale. 
[01:18:00]  Yurok is feeling not supported.  And then, all of a sudden, again, he doesn't show up.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dr. Ian Smith, he's feeling lonely.  Well, hold on for a second.  Now you're attacking my kids.  Hold on for a second.  I am at work in L.A. shooting my show.  I offered to Roland that I be in New York next week.  I don't live in New York anymore.  I said I would come to New York next week to be live.  They wanted to do it Friday.  I said, okay, no problem.  I told my team, I will wake up at 5 o'clock in L.A. to call in to be supportive. 
[01:18:30]  Ain't hearing it.  And that is 100% correct.  Ain't hearing it.  That's 100% correct, Dr. Ian.  Yes.  Yeah.  So why'd you leave Iraq just swinging in the room?  Because now Iraq looks like just a dumb hunk of shit.  I don't know.  Because we originally wanted to end the diet, I believe it was last Wednesday.  And we adjusted it to the 21st because that was for Ian's schedule.  You know what I'm hearing, Dr. Ian?  A lot of excuses.  Absolutely.  That worked out in your benefit.  You had more days to lose to 20 pounds.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  I would have been happy if that had happened if I was doing this.  You had an extra week and a half.  That's five and a half weeks.  At least an extra week to get to 20 pounds of weight loss.  You should have just blown off everything and just done what the fighters do when they  try to drop weight.  Right.  Just fucking lose the weight so you get over the line and then you...  Get rid of that water weight.  Yeah, I would have been in the sauna all morning.  Exactly.  Iraq just a minute ago was like, nobody gives a shit about this.  What I don't understand is, why didn't Ian completely stop his life to fly from California? 
[01:19:30]  Me, me, me.  Yeah, you want to change time zones?  Me, me, me.  Yeah, exactly.  If nobody gives a fuck, then...  Yeah.  Bring on a scale, boy.  Oh, Roland's feeling confident.  All right, I think it's time.  Yeah.  Dan Kaufman writes, final weight in this morning lost 17.6 pounds and body fat went down 5%.  From 187.8 to 17.2.  ONA fans, you guys are awesome.  That's great.  That's awesome.  Got lost some weight.  Yeah, most of the fans are ridiculously cool. 
[01:20:00]  We know that in the end.  Yeah, it's just that small 80% of them.  Anthony turned us on to the show with the fatties.  What is it called?  My 600-lb Life.  Yeah, have you seen any of those episodes?  I know the show, I just haven't seen the episodes.  Oh, my God.  That's incredibly infuriating because you just know that there's enablers around and  the person in the end just doesn't want to make any sacrifices whatsoever to try to  do the right thing.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  What do you think of those people?  Do you have sympathy or does it drive you nuts?  I don't know.  A show, I don't want to mention the name of the show.  A show asked me to come on and get involved in a situation like that.  And my whole point to the show was I can't do it because people have to have resources,  right?  They can't bring me in and all of a sudden I'm going to magically help people lose all  this weight.  Right.  If they go home to a team of people that are just like eating them bacon every morning  and not telling them to stop for the third serving.  Right.  You know, so I just think those shows, unfortunately, they do more mockery of the people than they 
[01:21:00]  do really trying to help them.  Exactly.  Freak show.  Oh, it's a freak show.  We all know it.  They're making believe they're trying to do the right thing, but they don't give a care.  I have a show where I help people lose weight where I come over their house and I just  mow at them and throw hard boiled eggs at their face.  Does that motivate them?  I don't know, but it makes me feel good.  All right.  So let's get on the scale.  So why don't we start with...  I feel like E-Rock should start.  Why?  Since he's already said that he's pretty much... 
[01:21:30]  Right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Good point.  You know.  All right, will you?  Yeah.  So E-Rock's starting weight, Dr. Dean Smith, before he went on your diet, was 247 pounds.  If he gets to 227 today, he gets to keep your 500, he gets 500 from me, and he gets 100  from Dr. Steve.  And he gets bragging rights.  That's right.  Oh.  Are you ready, E-Rock?  What does E-Rock need to be?  He needs to be 227.  227.  Why are you wearing a heavy sweatshirt?  Were you wearing...  That's what they weighed in pretty much. 
[01:22:00]  They don't even care.  Pretty much, this is how you weighed in initially?  Yeah.  Oh, you guys are...  All right.  Yeah, Roland wanted to pretty much strip nude to do this.  A minute ago, he didn't have his shoes on.  I was like, Roland...  Oh, Roland.  You had your shoes on the first time.  I know, you should have put cement in your shoes the last time, and it would have been...  All right, here we go.  Boo.  Eric's getting on the scale.  Dr. Ian Smith.  A card came out.  It's one at a time.  Oh, boy.  We got an oh, boy.  Have it, Sam.  Oh, man.  It's like a little disappointment.  Yeah, a big disappointment.  You didn't hit 227?  No.  Did you pass the number around to all of us? 
[01:22:30]  Okay.  No one say anything.  No one say anything yet.  I just want to see everyone's individual comment.  I got to see.  Am I going to round up per decimal or ignore the decimal?  No, you round up if it's .5 or higher.  Yeah, .5 or higher, you always round up.  Oh, yeah.  It was higher than...  Hang on.  Hang on, Roland.  .5 or higher.  Roland, get off the scale.  Roland.  Get off the scale.  Get on right now.  What are you doing?  All right.  Take a little peek.  Take a peek at...  Oh, you already saw what it was?  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  That's rounding up. 
[01:23:00]  Do you have to round it up though or no?  Anthony's laughing.  You suffered for five weeks.  Five weeks of suffering.  Wow.  Jones in shaking, falling asleep.  Oh, poor Eric.  Dr. Ian Smith.  What you got, guys?  E-Rock's final weight is 200.  Rounding up.  This is rounding up, too, by the way. 
[01:23:30]  Gave him a little help.  No, rounding up hurts him, I think.  Rounding up, right?  Oh, hurts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, right, right, right.  .6, which means you round up.  All right, .6.  So, okay.  It's just .4.  Dr. Ian Smith, E-Rock weighs 236 pounds.  236 pounds.  236.  He lost 11 pounds.  He shredded your box.  11 pounds.  All right.  Hey, listen, I'm not mad at E-Rock.  I mean, listen.  E-Rock.  But five weeks.  But five weeks, sir.  Five weeks of suffering.  I know. 
[01:24:00]  He's hyperventilating on the floor after 60 seconds of your workout.  Yeah.  He's fucking eating nothing.  He blew off the pizza.  Yeah, he did one deep knee bend and then called 911.  He's fighting with mice over cracker crumbs in the corners of the house.  Exactly.  He stepped on Mr. Jangles.  What do you think is the problem, Dr. Ian Smith?  Do you think there might be some lying going on?  Maybe there's some cheating or maybe he added a few extra blueberries to his smoothie? 
[01:24:30]  Too many blueberries to his smoothie.  I think the situation where E-Rock was not convicted from the beginning.  And I think E-Rock got his groove midway through.  But it's only a four-week program.  So if you lose kind of like your momentum in the beginning, you've got to kind of start off hitting the ground.  Right?  And I think with E-Rock, because he was kind of like on the fence about it.  He really was, let's be honest.  Right?  He was on the fence about it.  And so he kind of loses momentum a little bit and he just can't get it going.  So he does 11 pounds in four weeks. 
[01:25:00]  By the way, it's still 11 pounds.  Pick up an 11-pound weight.  Five weeks.  It's not a lot of weight to hold.  And a half.  Extra weight to hold.  And a half.  Five weeks.  But E-Rock, I mean, E-Rock, you've got to say, you weren't perfect on it.  Yeah.  And, you know, I wish I had given you the Shred 27 Burn DVD earlier because I think that would have helped earlier too.  He didn't do it.  But I've got to say, E-Rock gets a lot of abuse on the show.  He looks, he definitely looks like he lost more than 11 pounds.  This isn't the fattest we've seen E-Rock.  No. 
[01:25:30]  And I had...  He will balloon right back up now.  But...  No, no, no, no.  Thanks.  No, I had...  My wife was overseeing everything to make sure I wasn't straying from it.  She did the food shopping because when I go food shopping...  Yes, you buy goodies.  It's bad.  So she did that.  You like goodies.  Ding-dongs and ho-hos and chocodiles.  Every day we planned out the menu based on his recipes in the back of the book from his  soups to the smoothies and those kind of things. 
[01:26:00]  Okay, well...  What should we have tonight, sweetie?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yes.  Ian, what should he do now though?  Divorce papers.  I'm going to send him a copy of Shred, which is a more gradual program.  He hated that one.  That's where the...  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  That's the one.  Okay, alright.  So you've never done Shred.  You've never done Shred.  Shred is a six week, very easy program.  Where you don't lose weight as fast, but you can lose it more gradually.  So I'm going to send him a copy of Shred.  That he won't be as hungry?  Nah.  Nah.  He shouldn't be hungry on this. 
[01:26:30]  Listen, I got a guy just wrote in.  I mean, I'm looking here at your Twitter feed.  This guy, Nick Pennsylvania, went from 383 to 357.  Damn.  Okay?  That's pretty darn good.  Yeah.  Michael Stevens says, since I started the program after hearing about it on ONA,  I'm on day seven of week three.  Week three, day seven, down 19 pounds already.  So, like I said, guys-  There's someone dedicated.  Right.  Dedicated to it.  19 pounds.  Not cheating.  So we-  Fucking going through all of them.  What are you implying, sir? 
[01:27:00]  I was just saying this guy sounds like a real go-getter.  Why do we have failures around us?  Holy shit.  I'm implying something.  Okay.  And he just throats it right in your face.  Exactly.  Well, you attract what you are.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  That was just-  That's a mean spirit.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, what the fuck, man.  Geez.  Do you guys-  Do you want to hear Roland's?  Yeah, now it's time for Roland.  Oh, now Roland!  Who's on the Vinnie Testiverity diet.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  I'll pass-  He already stepped on the scale, so I'm going to pass the number.  Alright, so Roland's starting weight was 337 pounds and he blew off Ian's diet.  Yep.  However, I want you to see the number, and I want you to realize-  We're doing percentage.  And then I did a- I think I did the math.  Oh, no.  Correct.  You should do it on a calculator.  Yeah, that's what I've been doing.  Okay.  I got my show on work.  I got the phone calls from people that go, you guys are fucking idiots, it's not that! 
[01:28:00]  So Roland's starting weight was 337 pounds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Today he weighs 313 pounds.  Wow!  Booyah!  Vinnie Testiverity!  Woohoo!  That's a nice chunk.  He lost 24 pounds, Ian.  24 pounds.  Okay, what's the body weight percentage?  He's bouncing a little bit.  If I look at that and that, I think-  Well, okay.  Yeah.  You could do this properly?  By my math.  Yes. 
[01:28:30]  I believe Eric losing 11 pounds, that's losing 4.5%.  4.5%.  Does that sound about right, Ian?  4, 6, 1, 1, 6, 8, a little more than that.  Well, yeah.  Because you're taking, what's 11 pounds of 247?  It's more than 4%.  Because 10% is 12, right?  10% of 247 is about 12, and about half of that would be 5%. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, so it's about, sorry, 10% is 24, half of that is 12.  So it's about, it's about 4.75.  Yeah, I got 4.5 by doing the division.  Okay, that's fine.  And then, Roland's, 24 pounds.  Right.  By my math, it's 7.1%.  Wow.  Thank you.  Ah, shit, bacon today.  It's 7.1%.  So, chachis.  Go give me my A, cheese and bacon, people. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, guess what, Roland, I'm a man.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Wow.  Okay.  I'll see you in three weeks.  Let's see if you have it still off.  I am.  I'm a child.  Okay.  Now, there is something that has to be done here.  I believe E-Rock owes Dr. Ian Smith $500.  Oh, man.  Am I right?  Well, this is what I want to do.  Oh. 
[01:30:00]  Okay.  He's got a, this is what I want to do.  Yeah.  Eric is rolling his eyes.  Uh-oh.  Who is?  Eric.  Why are you rolling your eyes?  Because he knows it's another die.  He rolls back white.  It's light his eyes like a towel's eyes.  He does that so the boogie board doesn't hit him.  I'm sorry.  I'm playing with a big monster shark.  Yes.  So the ONA fan who tweets me the best before and after. 
[01:30:30]  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Between now and Monday.  Uh-huh.  Because a lot of people did a super shred diet.  So those who went on the super shred diet.  Do I qualify?  Josh, 24 pounds.  You weren't on the diet.  Yeah, right.  Mr. 7%.  Send me your best.  ONA fan, send me your best before and after.  I'm going to give half of the $500 to the ONA fan who has the best before and after.  Oh.  And then E-Rock, despite all the tumult and turbulence, I'm going to let you keep half of 
[01:31:00]  it.  Oh, man.  Keep half.  Is that fair?  E-Rock, comment.  E-Rock, comment.  E-Rock, comment.  E-Rock, comment.  250, buddy.  Thank you very much.  It's 250.  I appreciate that.  Mm-hmm.  And in lieu of not receiving the blenders that we were promised to, which I was told was  an essential part of this diet.  Oh.  Out of the Dr. Ian half.  Hang on, I'm talking.  On the other half of the Dr. Ian money.  No, no, no, no.  He just nutribullet.  He...  Stop the nonsense.  The blender is not...  What diet do you know that you need to have a blender? 
[01:31:30]  Well, it's yours since you said, oh, I'm giving you blenders to do the diet.  Oh.  Oh.  There are a thousand blenders in the stores.  Right.  Nutribullet.  I have a blender coming out that's being manufactured.  Don't even try to run that game.  I got 50,000 freaking tweets from people who've lost 20 more or more pounds with no freaking  blenders.  So stop the madness.  Okay.  More than 11?  More than 11 pounds, yes.  Leon.  Leon said I lost 14 pounds in two weeks. 
[01:32:00]  Rock on.  What were you getting to, Irock?  Mary from South Dakota said she lost 40 pounds from fitness confidence.  Jesus Christ.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  What were you getting at, though, with the blenders?  I want to hear this.  Um.  Hold on.  There's a tweet I want to read.  You make real shapes.  You have got a blender.  This is from Libby.  Dr. Smith.  I had the same issues with the super shred that Iraq has had.  I only lost a total of 6.2 and 4 of what?  Lack of dedication.  That was within the first week.  Total lack of dedication. 
[01:32:30]  She has a dedication.  She doesn't want to lose weight.  Fat pig woman.  What a whore.  Yeah, fat pig, selfish fool.  Did you eat those carrots?  She's probably done a donut.  I think it's been pretty successful.  I think so.  I think so, too.  Well, today we both lost weight.  It's good.  Huh?  We both lost weight.  Come on.  Don't look like a gift horse in the mirror.  I'm talking to you.  Touche, sir.  So, despite the fact that we didn't have the blenders, and also to celebrate Dr. Ian's 
[01:33:00]  generosity and standing behind me going through this diet from the other portion of Dr. Ian's  money is going to be used to fund a big pizza party for the staff and the programming floor  of Sirius XM at 1130.  So, you're not giving back any money.  You only ordered four pizzas.  That's only like 60 bucks.  Well, we're rounding it out based on what the estimated value of those blenders would have been.  Oh, wow. 
[01:33:30]  Which is why we translated it to pizza.  So, you're keeping the other, you're keeping 250 for yourself.  Well, that's coming out of Dr. Ian's side.  I like that you're fucking doing a pizza party at 1130 when we're all gone.  Yeah, really?  Well, they don't deliver a 10, otherwise it would have been here.  Oh, man.  So, you're keeping Ian Smith's other 250?  Well, we're deducting from the estimated value.  I don't know.  Where do blenders run?  110?  What the hell is going on here?  Why are you eating pizza?  Why are you going to blow your diet?  Yeah, why is...  Why are you ordering pizza for everyone?  Because Roland thought we needed a pizza party and I kind of agreed. 
[01:34:00]  Roland's losing weight on this pizza.  So, I was like, you know what?  Maybe there's something to that.  It's magical.  See, we only have to deal with this every once in a while.  Dr. Ian has to deal with this horseship all the time from people.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine?  Excuses why they now have to have a slice of pizza or treat themselves.  Treat yourselves.  Or excuses why they're not losing weight.  I'm staying on my diet and doing everything.  But you're blaming Ian.  Wait, now you have your diet?  What's your diet? 
[01:34:30]  Well, maintaining.  Ice cream, doing the fruit and vegetable smoothies, portion control, not eating junk  food, all that stuff.  I'm going to keep doing that.  Portions.  How many portions did you have?  Strawberries and whipped cream.  How many portions?  Scoop out some more sand.  All right.  Dr. Ian?  All right, guys.  Well, this is where we are.  I'm getting some tweets now from the O&A fans.  People have been asking about where to get the DVD from, the 27-minute workout. 
[01:35:00]  You can go to our website.  It's shredlife, S-H-R-E-D, life.com.  You can order the DVD.  It's pretty awesome.  And as far as E-Rock and rolling, hey, guys.  Listen, I know it's been tough, but four weeks.  You guys lost weight in four weeks.  Better than a lot of other people can say.  That is true.  That is true.  I hear a little anger in your voice right now, sir.  It's not anger.  It's just like, you know, it's just like, at some point you've got to man up, right?  Exactly.  You know, stop with the excuses. 
[01:35:30]  I mean, you know, to sit there and say that, you know, I didn't lose weight because I don't  have a freaking blender.  Oh, that's an excuse.  Oh, shit.  That is an excuse.  Huge excuse.  Which you hear all the time.  People come up with excuses all the time.  Yeah.  I'm just not an excuse kind of guy.  I'm a guy, you know, put your feet in your boots, pull up your boots, let's go out  and go to work and get it done.  I'm just very sure.  Get it done.  Can you imagine him saying, okay, here's $500.  If you can lose 20 pounds in four weeks, you get to keep the 500. 
[01:36:00]  Five weeks later, you lose 11 pounds.  He goes, I'm going to be a nice guy.  I'm still going to let you keep half.  And Iraq goes, no.  No, I'm just going to keep it.  I'm not going to give it back to you.  You're not getting it back.  That's not right.  What is that?  That's just not right at all.  And I'm going to buy pizza with it.  I'm going to buy everybody pizza with your money.  That's rubbing it in his face.  That really is.  Like, where does this power come from?  Such is my life on the O&A show. 
[01:36:30]  All right, brother.  Love you, miss you.  Thank you, Dr. Ian.  Bye, Ian.  Thanks.  Bye, buddy.  One more thing.  Be cool.  Bye.  There he goes, Dr. Ian Smith.  Wow.  Just getting a beating.  We got abused on this program.  Wow.  So where do you think it went wrong?  What do you think is the biggest reason you didn't lose the 20?  When I stopped exercising.  The diet did a complete 180, but I'm not eating anything that I used to have anymore. 
[01:37:00]  But it seems you need fuel to exercise.  Right.  And if you're down on your fuel because you're dieting, I can't imagine that.  I had plenty of fuel.  Do you eat a lot of grilled chicken?  I'd change it up between salmon, grilled chicken, pork, things like that.  Do you get the skin on the chicken?  I don't eat pork.  Oh, I do.  No.  I don't eat skinless grilled chicken.  You don't dig on swine?  No.  No.  Better be one charming motherfucker.  He couldn't have had that little fuel. 
[01:37:30]  Not like he came in here and lost 50 pounds.  Yeah.  You make a good point there, Sam Roberts.  We have one more thing to do, don't we, Sam?  Yes, we do.  Do you think there's been excuses, Sam?  Oh, my God.  Have there been excuses?  No excuses.  I told you everything I did.  I think you did all right.  I didn't make excuses for anything.  You look like you lost more than 11 pounds for real.  I would keep it up if I was you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And there goes Roland giving you the cat thing.  Roland's going to get some bacon and fucking cheese omelets. 
[01:38:00]  By the way, Roland's going to be so confident in this, he's going to be convinced that he can literally eat whatever he wants.  Yeah.  And not keep one pound of that weight.  She's a mind trick the fucking weight off of him.  Are you going to continue losing weight?  Or is this it for you?  I'm going to continue.  You're going to continue?  I'm going to lose 220 pounds by the summertime.  220?  Yeah.  You're going to lose another 100 pounds?  Yeah.  Wow.  Before summer?  Yeah.  You've got to exercise.  Mark, you just said you would fall down for exercise. 
[01:38:30]  Guys, guys, it was for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  He's just the weirdest person.  He's hilarious.  I love it.  No, I'm going to do it.  But I do eat whatever I want so I'm full.  I'm going to keep on with the Vinnie Tortorich book that works.  It works for me.  He eats whatever he wants until he's full.  Right.  And then he falls down and he clutches his abs when he sits up.  He falls down.  But I will be celebrating at Dominic and Sal's Bakery today.  Just plug shit. 
[01:39:00]  You can't celebrate with a cronut.  Well, I'm not.  He has a new dessert now.  It's like a little tiramisu hazelnut.  How can you eat that on a...  Oh, you can't have any grains or sugars.  What?  That's all sugar.  But...  I'm going to shock my system into happiness.  And now I'll lose weight again.  It's just...  I gotcha.  Alright, we do have one more thing to celebrate the end of the way off.  Oh, what is that?  It's a special guest.  Oh, cool.  Should I invite him in? 
[01:39:30]  I do like a good special...  No.  Why?  You have to hang out.  The bosses won't here.  No.  What's wrong?  We have a special guest.  I'm sure you do.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  Who do you think the guest is?  Bring him in.  Who do you think it is?  I have a feeling I know who it is.  Take a guess.  No.  Why?  Oh, shit.  What's the matter?  Eric.  What's the matter, Iraq?  There's real hate for this person, huh?  Let me see.  Oh, really? 
[01:40:00]  That's my guess.  Let me see.  I can't see.  Alright, we're going to bring in our special guest now.  Oh, man.  To celebrate the end of the big way off.  There it is.  Hey, hi, sir.  How are you doing?  What's up?  How are you?  Everybody likes me.  Get your headphones on.  And who are you, sir?  If you follow me on Twitter, some people...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You've got to eat the mic.  If you follow me on Twitter, you might know me as Mondo270.  Ah.  But some people know me as Sean F. 
[01:40:30]  Sean F.  Sean F.  Sean F, of course.  Good morning.  And your claim to fame with the Opie and Anthony show?  Twelve E-Rock songs.  Twelve.  One for every pound E-Rock.  Oh, that's right.  What are some of the titles of the twelve E-Rock songs?  Because I'm...  What are some of the E-Rock songs we got?  Oh.  He's so nervous.  Well, we got...  Are you getting water?  Oh, I am a dry mouth boy.  Oh, you are. 
[01:41:00]  He's...wow.  He's like doing...  His legs are moving.  He's got his hands on top of his headphones.  Yeah, he's holding his hands on his headphones.  So they don't shake.  Wow.  There's You're Fat as Fuck.  There's Sympathy for E-Rock, which is the big one.  I like that one.  That was a big hit.  Uh...  What are some of those other E-Rock songs we got?  What do we have?  We got...uh...  There's twelve of them.  Oh, boy.  He's so nervous.  I love this.  What else?  I love when people come in all nervous.  It's so much easier to do in my apartment when I'm alone.  Yes. 
[01:41:30]  At three in the morning.  People think this is very easy to do.  Oh.  Don't fuck yourself.  But before we get it twisted, I just want everybody to know this is for motivation.  Oh, it is.  This is not to tear down E-Rock.  No, of course.  It's to build him up.  Yeah, I mean, because we have the twelve songs that didn't work.  Wait, did you used to have a beard or is that a different picture you used?  That's not me.  That's some weird foreign video that I saw.  Why would you do that?  Hey.  I just always thought that was you.  Nah, it's kind of an anonymous type thing.  Mondo 270 is kind of like my Opie instead of Greg Hughes. 
[01:42:00]  You know, that kind of thing.  I know.  I've got to get some water.  Wow.  I've got nothing.  Yeah, have some water.  I know.  Wow.  Come on, Salary Glance.  Salary Glance.  Salary Glance.  Salary Glance.  I have rarely seen someone this nervous.  I'm going to be singing in a minute.  Imagine what that's going to be.  Do you have it written down?  Yeah, I do.  Okay.  Thanks so much, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy, I saw at the Borgata last week.  Thanks so much.  It was awesome.  Oh, thank you.  How about that?  Friday night. 
[01:42:30]  Do you have a new song to celebrate the big way off?  Well, yeah.  Since the $1,100 didn't work for motivation and the twelve E-Rock songs I already did,  we're going to try to do a live one and see if that motivates E-Rock a little bit.  And this is brand new.  This is brand spanking new.  Are you psyched, E-Rock?  God, he's got to be.  Why aren't you looking at him?  I think Sal should be, somebody should be filming this.  I think this is important, an important piece of the show's history.  And, uh, why aren't you looking at him?  E-Rock, yeah, talking to the mic, the boss is asking you a question.  Twelve songs, at least give me a look. 
[01:43:00]  When the boss asks you a question, answer the boss.  Oh, man.  Nah.  You really don't like this guy.  No.  Nice man.  E-Rock, I actually brought gifts for you, too.  I don't give a shit.  No, seriously.  You're going to like them.  A blender?  No, not the blender.  Those blenders.  Those all-important blenders.  Wow, this is, like, real.  You make a promise you don't deliver.  What do you do?  Wow.  Now, E-Rock, why don't you like Sean F?  Is it the songs he wrote?  I think that might be it.  He's contributed to the show you work on. 
[01:43:30]  I think that's a good thing.  E-Rock complimented...  I think you all want a thank you.  Did he hurt your feelings?  I am not fans, nor have I downloaded any of these songs.  Hmm.  You're not fans?  I'm not a fan.  Oh.  I meant to say I'm not fans of this song, but...  Now, E-Rock, you complimented...  What does E-Rock say?  There's nervousness in this studio.  No, mine's just anger.  There's anger, there's nervousness, there's animosity, there's...  We get so jaded.  Disappointment. 
[01:44:00]  There's just...  We really do get, like, jaded on a daily basis coming in here and doing this, and it's just  what we do.  You see people that come in and just do this.  It's so funny to watch.  They get all fucking...  It's our job.  I'm not Ed Naughton.  I guess it's our job to try to make it easier for them, but fuck that.  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  Make it worse.  Wow.  So, you don't like Sean F., you haven't looked at him.  Do you even know what he looks like?  I've seen a photo of him.  I have?  He's live, right behind you, and you refuse to turn. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, funny how that works.  So, what's the name of the new song, Sean F.?  It's called Lazy Guy.  Oh, geez.  Lazy Guy!  There's a sing-along part, and there's a clap-along part, so join in when you can.  Nice.  Now, can you hear the music?  Oh.  Yeah, you should be able to hear this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is to celebrate the big way-off that we just had.  I'm psyched.  Oh, yeah.  Little Paul Notes. 
[01:45:00]  He loves food and flavored treats.  He's a fat, lazy jerk.  Likes to call out of work.  Slabo!  Is how he's known.  Cause he's never been fit.  And he has flabby tits, so why?  Won't he just exercise?  He'd rather be eating pie. 
[01:45:30]  Lazy Guy!  Lazy Guy!  With flabby boobs!  He's always eating food!  Slabo!  Lazy Guy!  With flabby boobs!  Lazy Guy!  He's eating food!  Lazy Guy!  With flabby boobs!  He's always eating food!  Go fish!  Lazy Guy!  With flabby boobs!  He's always eating food!  Go fish!  Lazy Guy!  With flabby boobs!  Lazy Guy!  With flabby boobs!  Lazy Guy! 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Iraq, what'd you think?  Iraq comment?  It was a song.  It was.  He's not gonna give us anything.  There was a clap part in there, too.  I liked the clap part.  Yeah, the clap part was fun.  Nice, right?  I got to play along a little.  Good stuff.  That was good.  Yeah.  Your look is brutal.  Oh, Iraq is just not a happy guy.  Sad enough when we play these, like, without him standing right there.  Without him being five feet away.  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Does Iraq, have you seen Iraq before?  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, he Google images me every chance he can.  I mean, photos and stuff, but...  Never in person.  Never in person?  Never in person.  But, uh...  Honestly, is he as big as you thought he would be?  Uh, about where I thought he would be.  Oh, shit.  From the guy that writes fat, fuck, tit songs?  No, that's not knocking him down.  I'm just saying, you know.  Well, no.  The pictures represent what he looks like.  Oh, okay.  While you're here, you might as well, I don't know. 
[01:47:00]  Maybe do another one.  Do another one.  Oh, okay.  If he's here.  Did you like that song?  Oh, I guess that look means no.  No.  I did not care for that song.  Okay.  What else you got today, Seanan?  Uh...  Do you want to try your fat as fuck?  Can we tell that?  Do you want to try...  Yeah.  Want to try Hotel California?  Anyone?  Yeah, yeah.  Anyone? 
[01:47:30]  I love E-Rock, by the way.  Aw.  You do?  That's nice.  I wouldn't make 12 songs if I didn't love the guy.  That is true.  What do you like about him?  He's funny.  Oh.  He's got a very, um...  He's funny.  All right.  He's funny.  And, uh...  He's never said no to this radio show.  I know that much.  That's right.  Cinnamon Challenge.  Uh...  Dedicated to the show.  Great guy.  Great guy.  All right.  Team player.  When you get him.  Yes.  You're fat as fuck!  Oh. 
[01:48:00]  You are a slob-o!  Nice.  Yeah!  I like it.  Long intro.  Vondo270 on the Twitter.  Join in if you want to, E-Rock.  Come on, everybody.  After all is said and done.  You look like shit.  You weigh a ton. 
[01:48:30]  You're a fat toe.  You barely move, except to eat.  Your gut sticks out.  Can't see your feet.  You're an overweight fool.  You're at your worst when it's time to do work.  You just don't seem to care.  You're a fat lazy jerk.  You're fat as fuck.  Wow.  You are a slob-o!  He's five feet away.  I know.  When it's time to produce.  You just sit on your big flabby ass.  Oh. 
[01:49:00]  You've got a gut.  You have big titties.  You just never seem to be stuffed.  You're fat as fuck.  I can't look over there.  Oh, wow.  It's motivation.  It's motivation.  I really don't get uncomfortable.  Yeah.  It's one of my faults, I guess, in life.  It's a little uncomfortable.  It's a little uncomfortable.  I'm very uncomfortable.  You just never seem to be stopped  You're fat as fuck  I can't look over there  It's motivation  I really don't get uncomfortable 
[01:49:30]  It's one of my faults  I guess in life  I'm very uncomfortable  This is so rare  The reviews coming in  A lot of people and I agree  You sound so much better live  Than you do on the fucking recordings  Thanks so much  If I could just get some saliva in my frigging mouth  Maybe that's it  You're hitting your notes  A dry nervous fucking mouth is what you need  You sound better live  Thanks so much everybody  Thanks to everybody on Twitter  Everybody in the ONA Nation 
[01:50:00]  But it doesn't matter what we think  E-Rock, what do you think?  What did you think of that one?  You're fat as fuck  I heard the title  Classic  I'm thinking how easy it is  To stab someone in the throat  Oh, he's going to pull a peggie on him  Now, E-Rock  You hear him crying?  Yeah, you're not the one cursing  At my friend Ace now, are you?  You're not singing fat as fuck now, are you?  Now, E-Rock  You bummed out  Because this was kind of supposed to be 
[01:50:30]  A day of victory for you  This was like a victorious day  You did do good  You lost 11 pounds  Which is  You know, it's a start  It's a fucking  It's good  It's an end  It's a pizza party  But do you feel like today was  It was supposed to be a day of victory  And it's kind of turned into  Just another humiliation  No, I was expecting it  Oh  Not this  But I was expecting that  It would take a turn for the worse  Yeah  It always does  I can't tell you  How much more uncomfortable  This is than I thought it would be  It is  I didn't think it would be 
[01:51:00]  You won't even look at him  I'm warming up  Let's do another one  Oh, wow  He wants to do a fucking concert  Is this the encore?  I'm just kidding  We don't have to  Oh, I would like to  Hear another one  Do you have one more?  That's good  Got one?  What are you thinking?  You are here  It's only 8.35  Right  Got another hour  Two hours in you?  Maybe a little sympathy for E-Rock?  It's Friday  I hate when E-Rock brings up the  Yeah  Oh, today is Friday  The obvious  Yeah  I'm just killing time 
[01:51:30]  Oh, you might as well  How about one more, Sean F?  What do you got?  Let's do it  How about a little sympathy for E-Rock?  Well, that would be your encore  That's the big one  That's your stairway to heaven, sir  Yeah  Encore, how fucking long is this going?  This is the last one  We have five more to do  E-Rock  E-Rock poured  E-Rock poured water all over my chair  Oh  It was supposed to be a day of  This was supposed to be in the W column for E-Rock  Even if he didn't beat Roland  Yeah  It was still a good day  He lost 11 pounds  And we're turning somehow into just another failure  But there's nothing good that happens here 
[01:52:00]  That is true  Oh, we've had some good things happen  Yeah, they always go to shit  E-Rock succeeded  And it's still being turned into  I don't think a 20  He didn't succeed  I mean, it's fine that he lost  But it's not a success  At all  It is  E-Rock failed the mission  Not as much of a success  Let's say hi to Steve in Pennsylvania  Steve  Yes  Yes, hello  Hey guys, live it  Hey  This has to be the fucking funniest show I've heard  In like 10 years I've been listening

He booked him  We're gonna have to do Sam's songs next

Yeah  E-Rock is a dinosaur  Marching, marching  E-Rock is a dinosaur  How did he get so fast?  So creepy  E-Rock is a dinosaur  Marching, marching 
[02:02:30]  Wake up, little piggy boy  And fucking take us out  All right, I gotta go to the phones  Because people are visualizing the studio  And we're not lying  E-Rock hasn't looked at him  And Sean is singing these songs  A mere four to five feet  Yeah, right behind him  Right behind him  Let's say hi to Janine in North Carolina  Janine  Hi there  Hello  Please tell me that Eric is acting  Because the cringe factor is off the charts  No, E-Rock is not acting  He's breaking a pen right now 
[02:03:00]  He's looking down at the table  Standing next to me  Ma'am, I could tell you  I could count on one hand  The times I've been uncomfortable  Doing this radio show  And today is absolutely one of them  Uncomfortable  It is brutal  Yeah  It's horrible  It's horrible  All right, thank you  Bye  Let me say hi to Chris in Virginia  Chris  Hey  Hey  Yeah, I was just gonna say  I have this visual in my head  Of E-Rock just like  Sitting there pouting  As this guy just tears him a new ass 
[02:03:30]  It's less pouting  And more like murderous rage  He's stealing  Yeah, yeah, yeah  He's stealing  Hopefully  Hopefully he'll be able to like  Lose a little more weight  With his new asshole  That he's been  Look at Anthony's photo  That he twittered  And you can see everything  You need to see  With Sean  Belting out a tune  Selling it  Yeah, really selling it  Selling the song  And E-Rock can't be bothered  Yeah  And if it's any gauge  On how the audience is reacting  Yeah  The whole staff is packed 
[02:04:00]  Into that phone room  And they're all  Of course they are  Are they supporting E-Rock?  No  They're supporting the segment  They're supporting the show  Oh, supporting the show  And the segment  I did see through the glass  Troy's fucking giant  All I saw was teeth  And a fucking hipster hat  And I'm like  Troy's very happy  He really is  Dave in Brooklyn  Dave  Yeah  Yo, y'all need to ease up  On E-Rock, man  It's not his fault  That he's a fucking sex  Oh, come on now  We don't need the listeners  I was tricked  I was tricked  I was tricked on that one  Now they're piling on 
[02:04:30]  Why?  It's our boy  Let's say hi  To Ronnie in North Carolina  Ronnie  This ain't a good bit  Without a good  Now it's just  Now it's just  Sad  Because it's like  Fully gang  It's fun to have a nickname  That's a brand name  Alright, well  Sean F., this was terrific  Thanks, man  Sean F., what a job  Thanks so much  And he pulled off the songs live  That's not easy to do  Better than the recordings  Especially because  You're a nervous  Nelly  Oh, my God, yeah  Did you think they sound  A good live  As far as just 
[02:05:00]  Aesthetically  Sonically  Yeah, sonically  Yeah  They were songs, yes  They were songs  They were songs  They were performed  You're going to leave the studio  Without looking at them  I have no interest  Will you accept my gifts?  What are the gifts?  We at least got to see  Yeah, of course  Samuel will grab them  Yeah, I'll get them for you  Sam will get the gifts  Yeah, for sure  You're not going to accept the gift  If it's you standing on a stool  With a noose around your neck  Don't try to make good now  Yeah, I know  It's over  This guy in the line just writes 
[02:05:30]  I want to bully  Rock  There's this mentality in humans  That just  They want to pile on  Bully E-Rogg  The show  Yeah, that's true  I want to see what he says  Because he might be being ironic  Yeah, you already said it on the air  Might as well let him do it  But there's a cleverness to this  He's just kidding  Hoagie, what's up?  You rock?  Hey  Do you want to eat me, right?  Because I'm a fat sub  Fatty 
[02:06:00]  Huh?  Be a star, sir  Don't be a bully  Fatty  He's not cool  All right  Sean F  He's just saying fatty  That's not  Sean F  What do you got?  Got a couple gifts for E-Rogg  Just E-Rogg?

If Eric doesn't want those gifts  I'll take them  Well, it's a  It's a  It's hard to say  Without giving it away  It's very  You're not going to see it a lot  It's very  Collectible  And it's presented very well  How old is that top one?  How old is that?  Just about 20 years  Jesus  Are you kidding?  That's an industry  Standard presentation  Are you willing to  Accept two 
[02:07:30]  Very nice gifts  From Sean F  This is a gesture  This is an amazing gesture  By the way  I can't believe  He's fucking doing it  This puts E-Rock in a tough spot  It really does  It's legit  One of the better gifts  A staff member  Probably one of the best gifts  I've ever seen anyone  Bring anybody  That works here  As it goes to their personalities  Wow  You should really turn around  Take a look at this  You know what?  That is a lot of thought  A lot of thought went into that  Let me take a couple phone calls  As E-Rock  Think it over, E-Rock  And then we want your answer  In a minute 
[02:08:00]  Jason in Chicago  Jason  Yeah, you guys have  A shorter memory than E-Rock  You guys gave out his phone number  While he was in Florida  If you're not careful  You're going to be having a rifle  On the top of a tower  With a rifle killing people  Oh, that's not  Oh, no  I don't think so  That's my rifle  I know where they live  Why the exercise  Is getting to the top of the tower  Good point, Jim  If E-Rock won't  Turn around  And take the gifts  Can I request another E-Rock song  To be played  Not one of mine  But somebody named Jefferson K  He's got one of the better E-Rock songs 
[02:08:30]  Wow, look at this  There's a whole fraternity  There's a whole fraternity  I don't think you did  I don't think you did  Jefferson K is on SoundCloud  I'd rather  All right, hold on  Let me say  Let's check Jefferson K out, though  Let's get to it  He's got some good stuff  He's got about eight songs  Check out Jefferson K on SoundCloud  He's catching up  Somewhere right now  Kevin Pollack is laughing his ass off  Someone wrote  And we go to Tim in Nebraska  Tim  Hey, Hope  You're going to be feeling pretty good today  Got a gig for 500 bucks  500 to me  That's like fucking nothing  Give me a bag of shells, my friend  Didn't matter any the fucking way 
[02:09:00]  Are you kidding me?  Jimmy, you were great on Netflix  Oh, thanks, buddy  Oh, very funny  All right, Tim  So what do we do?  You want to hear the Z-Rock song?  I don't know  What's Jefferson K's SoundCloud name?  It should just be Jefferson K  Let me say how to Scooter in Atlanta  While you find that  Scooter  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey  Hey, Jimmy  I saw you and you were down here  You're funny as shit, man  Thank you  Man, this is the funniest shit  I've ever heard you guys do  In a long time  But you know what kind of messes me up  Is every now and then  Sam lets out this cackle 
[02:09:30]  He sounds like my mother-in-law  And he just kind of  Oh, boy  We're fully aware  Most people hate Sam, by the way  Don't worry about it  That's why he's not on  Entertainment Weekly channel  Because you're not telling us anything  We don't know already  We know most of you hate Sam  That's not  What song is it, Sean F?  Sam's almost got it  Yeah, it's this one right here  This is probably my favorite E-Rock song  Right next to George Hookus  Wow  You're understanding  Of course you might have to play  George Hookus, right?  George Hookus 
[02:10:00]  That's the classic  E-Rock  This is Jefferson K  E-Rock is moving over there  To, you know, throw dirty tissues out  And then he walks back to his spot  Yeah, without looking  I know he's curious about the gifts, though  I would  Are you curious about the gifts?  I'll take a look at them  There you go  There you go  Very curious  He loves a treat  I'll take a look at them  I'll take a look at them  I love it  Alright, let's play this  That was good  I don't even want to say  What the name of the song is  Sean F says 
[02:10:30]  This is the best E-Rock song  Right next to George Hookus  Yeah  Okay  We've never heard this on the air  It's a little midi action  E-Rock  E-Rock  It's a Miley Cyrus  Yes  Goldfish and hokey rolls everywhere  Morbidly obese and he don't care  Cause he's fucking lazy as shit now  No exercise  All he does is sit down  Is he ready? 
[02:11:00]  Get his diet on  He'd scream out hell now  Cause you know his pants fit tight  Eating snacks after midnight  Alright  Look at his belly  You know he can eat  Can't even see his feet  He eats whatever he wants  Lots of cold clothes  Garlic butter sauce  His bitch tits fly  He's a fast slob  He's the hard man of O&A 
[02:11:30]  No more tequila and donut days  His bitch tits fly  Such a fast slob  Cardiac arrest is on the way  If we were lucky  You could have a two day  Oh boy  This is just me  I don't like it  You don't like that one?  Not really  I don't agree with the cardiac arrest thing  None of my songs talk about  I just don't think  I think he's shoehorning  Yeah  And Sean  You gotta stop being  You gotta realize you're the guy now 
[02:12:00]  Yeah  Don't be a fanboy  I think he's so generous  Not giving a fair enough  You're the guy  Second rate E-Rock song guys  Can I  I mean E-Rock won't turn around and look at him  But what about the  What about the hookus guy?  We got it in the system  Can we play the hookus guy?  Somebody twittered a picture  Shaun of an E-Rock hugging it out  And it's fucking  Ned Beatty hugging the guy's stomach from Deliverance  Oh that's not  Don't show E-Rock  That's not nice  Is that Nails In?

Huh?  He took the comic  Because when they graded  They put it in an acrylic case  So it's hard  And he held it tight with his two hands at the bottom

[02:30:00]  Relax  But in the good medical care  We win  Well done  Our nation's capital  You're welcome  And goodbye  Canada wins  Incredible  Incredible  Incredible  Incredible  Gold medalist  Down two nothing  All right, all right  We were there  Bunch of fucking broad with sticks  It's all about the men's team anyway  Yeah, exactly  The real hockey game  You know, between the men  The men play at noon today 
[02:30:30]  Not the broads  You won the broad hockey  Bunch of holes running around  Right  Bunch of holes  Bunch of broads  Yeah, fucking it up  So that was exciting  Yeah  So Jonathan Davis from Korn  Is losing his mind, I see  Yeah, what happened there?  I kind of  We like Jonathan  We've talked to him a lot  Over the years  He's been in, right?  Yeah  It's been a while  Unfortunately  It's probably been like  Four or five years  Since the last time 
[02:31:00]  But  Yeah, he was on a K-Rock  And they performed  Yeah, he performed for us  We go way back to the  AAF days with Korn  Yeah  And not many people  Even knew who they were yet  But he's got a big clip  On TMZ this morning  He's basically saying  The government is using  People like Miley Cyrus  To distract from  What's really going on  Whoa  How is the government  Is she a secret agent?  I believe the government  Loves a good distraction 
[02:31:30]  They do  But I don't think  They are controlling  The distraction  Or pushing the distraction forward  How would they go about  Doing that?  I wonder  I don't know  I guess it's a tough one  To tie in the Miley Cyrus  Yeah  To distract  Well, let's listen to the  Yeah, let's hear how he says it  Sure  I didn't want to ask  I just saw the video  Spike in my vein  You know  It's kind of powerful  It has a lot of current events  The president  Snowden  You know 
[02:32:00]  What exactly  What was like  The message behind the video?  What were you guys  It's basically a video  Where people want to  Wake up  And see what's going on  It's not necessarily  Everybody's fault  Thank you so much  Yeah, yeah, yeah  They just got crazy lies  And America's really into it  I think that our government  Uses those people  To detract  And what's really going on  And you guys  You get very interested  In what's going on  In their lives  Instead of, you know  The thing with the whole  Miley Cyrus  I think with the BMA  When that went together 
[02:32:30]  I think Barack Obama  Passed a law  That he was basically  A dictator  He can imprison  Whatever he wants  He doesn't have to charge  And he can hold him  As long as he wants  And so  Okay  So it's like  They're using media  Oh, everybody's on  Miley Cyrus  Being twerking  Or whatever  Yet  They're missing the point  That they're actually  Passing laws  While they're happening  It's not that crazy  No  It's not that crazy  But the government's  Not using Miley Cyrus  No  He's saying that  They're taking advantage 
[02:33:00]  When things do come up  Like, alright  Miley Cyrus  On the MTV  Music Awards  Went crazy  She's twerking  All of a sudden  The news is full of that  So then they take  That opportunity  And go, okay  Let's slide some of these  Bills under the table  Then we could sign some shit  And it won't really  Hit the news  Because they're  That absolutely happens  Absolutely  He's not crazy at all  Right  That absolutely happens  Yes  See, I listened to this clip  Yesterday  But it was so  It's so hard to hear  I just tapped out  But that absolutely happens 
[02:33:30]  They wait  Yeah, that makes perfect sense  It's like, oh, fuck  Everyone's paying attention  To the twerking  Let's slide a few things  Let's slide a few things  Under there  No, we'll  Yeah  Yeah, I completely agree  With that  We'll sneak around  Behind this  And fucking  Right  But then the news  Should be smart enough  To go, whoa  Hold up  We were focused on the twerking  Look what these fuckers did  They don't care  Because they just want  To put the twerking on TV  True  Ratings, yeah  Yeah  Yeah, they don't care  What the government's doing  Unless it makes for  A really good headline  Mm-hmm 
[02:34:00]  Wow, okay  All right  Then he's not  He's not that crazy at all  No  He's a very sensible man  He talks weird now, though  What's that?  Didn't he always talk like that?  I don't remember him  Being like that  Losing his hair a little, huh?  Oh  Poor bastard  It happens  I know it does  It's terrible  You think he can still get laid  After a show?  Oh, gosh  Oh, yeah  It's Jonathan Davis  My God  Exactly  Korn had a lot of great songs  Thank God  Were you to Korn, Jimmy?  No, I didn't hate them  But they weren't my favorite  I mean, it just wasn't my style  What was a big song by them? 
[02:34:30]  On the Cobb  You ever hear On the Cobb?  Oh, no, no, no  But I like In My Shit  There we go  That was a good one, too  Oh, yeah  What's some of those Korn songs we got?  Adidas  Adidas  What about Blind?  Blind was one of my big hits  Probably their best song  Yeah, let's play a little Blind for Jimmy  Yeah, I mean, again  They had that style  Which I wasn't crazy about  That style was cool for a while 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, I don't think they stink  It's just not my  Let me hear Blind  Oh, yeah  Sounds like a Doors song  No, it doesn't  You know this, no?  Yeah  What year is this? 
[02:35:30]  Oh, God  95, 6-ish  97, maybe  Somewhere in there  Oh, yeah  Around there, I would imagine  94  Wow, even earlier  Geez, okay  A little slow in the opening  Yeah  Remember the whole crowd?  They would get the whole crowd just bouncing  That's where they'd start  Right  And the bounce would happen  The whole arena would just bounce 
[02:36:00]  I saw them live  I've seen them a couple times live  Yeah  Opening for Ozzy  Oh, people would get fucking destroyed  Mosh pits  Yeah  Yeah  Jesus Christ  Yeah, it's, you know  And it kicks in  Bam  Oh, man, I'm back at AM 
[02:36:30]  I like this  I'm gonna be in a corn loop today  It just hit me  Cause this brings back  Really cool memories  Being up there in Boston  Yeah  Definitely not my style  It's got a cool voice  Yeah  Yeah, this is pretty good shit  Do you like coins now? 
[02:37:00]  Uh, I like this album  I remember buying this album at the Wiz  I miss this whole decade of fucking music  The Wiz  Nobody beats the Wig  I'm the Wiz  I'm the Wiz  I'm the Wiz  I'm the Wiz  The Wiz used to have a whole wall of like the Billboard 100  Yeah  Like the top 100 albums  And you just go  And you can see  Yeah  Everything  Cause there wasn't the internet yet  So you didn't know like  Yeah, there was  This is a great video  Yeah, I do not love this 
[02:37:30]  Oh, yeah  Oh, Woodstock 99  That's when  Just talking about the crowd  Like crowd jumping up and down  Oh, yeah  Show me the crowd jumping up and down  Yeah  I want you to jump up and down  This looks so crazy  I forgot about  Oh, my God  I forgot this video  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah  Oh, was this insanity  They're just waiting  Yeah, they're just teasing the crowd right now  And then  They're very popular 
[02:38:00]  Fuck it  Oh, my God  Everyone just bounced in at the same time  It looks like water  That's fucking rules  Ah, what happened to rock and roll?  Oh, fuck, right?  What happened to rock and roll?  It stinks  Fuck  Look at this shit  That's a live show, you motherfuckers  Jesus Christ  Fucking stack of amps  Behind the guitar player 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, that's cool  Hey, he's no Don Henley on stage, huh?  Yeah, come on  Hey, guys  Come on  Jesus  That's gotta make a band feel good, huh?  Fuck  That's gotta feel so fucking good  To sing that song in front of all those people like that  Were they the headline band? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, yeah  For the whole festival?  Oh, no, no, no  For Wistock?  No, they're just a fuckloader  Yeah, they had everybody  It was huge  No, they were the headliners  But who went on after them?  Who was there?  Peppers were there, right?  Probably the Peppers  Peppers were there  Very huge  Green Day had a huge performance  Green Day had a great one  Was that the one with the water bottles?  No, that was the mud  The mud  The mud  Just picking up mud and grass  Crazy  Divots and just throwing them on stage  Who was on stage when the water bottles went flying?  I think that was the Red Hot Chili Peppers  Oh, fucking crazy 
[02:39:30]  I think  Just emptied  But they were empties  Well, not really  Well, some of them are  Look at all the mud on the fucking stage  They just destroyed  Was it Primus?  Uh, maybe  Primus with the water bottles?  Limp Bizkit  See, Woodstock 94 I was at  And I enjoyed that  Did you perform at that?  I did  Not on the main stage  We did  I have photos of them  20 years ago  You performed in Woodstock  94  Oh, yeah  Holy fuck  Look at how far  Those clubs of mud are  What a bunch of assholes  94 was great  Like it really was  Is that 94 or not?  Yeah, that's 94 
[02:40:00]  Look at the mud  And the fucking grass  And the  Oh, my God  That had to feel good for those guys  Like, fuck yeah  They're trying  Like, security up front  Is trying to do something  But it's impossible  That stage is covered with mud  Right  I'm bringing pictures  From the fucking 94  What the fuck happened?  This was right when they were  Getting up there  Fast forward  There's a Broadway show now  Right, right  That album's 20 years old  I got a picture of Bob Levy  With his little cock out  Because he was on mushrooms 
[02:40:30]  And his fucking cock  Was an eighth of an inch  And he pulled his pants aside  And we snapped a photo of it  It was terrible  It was terrible  His fucking cock was  Yeah, I got a photo of me, Boss  Uh, Florentine and Jameson  Wow  Pro Louise was one of the announcers  Of that show  Oh, was he?  Yeah, man  He remembers all you guys  Doing it  Jeff Ross was up there  He was Jeff Lipschulz back there  That's his real name  Jeff was there  He wasn't Jeff Ross yet  No, no  Huh  The best one, though  I think is Thunderstruck  As far as audience participation  By ACDC 
[02:41:00]  Oh, that's a good one  Yeah  Oh, Rage Against the Machine  Burned a flag on stage  At 99  Right  They bug me  They do?  They just  I know they're gray  They're just corny to me  They got some great songs  You can do what they taught  Ugh, really?  I kind of like it  You don't like that?  Fuck you  I won't do what you tell me  You don't like that?  No  No, none of it  This whole decade  Bulls on parade  You really did miss this whole  But it was a huge decade  You said chili peppers, green day  And I literally  You could have said 
[02:41:30]  Tissue box and coffee  As far as what I paid to see  Oh, no, they were on the second stage  They were great  That's just not my style of music  That was a strong ten years  I'm telling you  It holds up  It was strong  It was so fucking rock oriented  That's what it was  I wish that I would have gotten into it  Because there's so much fucking music being played by these  Music's so shitty now  That our old station up there in Boston  They like play Jethro Tull and stuff now  Because there's just no  There's no fucking buzz in the rock world  Amazing  We didn't have time to play any of that stuff up there  Because they all were coming out with great songs 
[02:42:00]  Remember how many fucking  We didn't even have room to play everything  Oh, the string cheese incident  Yeah, the currents that would come out  That's just a jam band  That's not the same thing  As talking about Rage and Green Day  No, I'm looking at the actual  Oh, the same clan posse was there  Oh, you were looking at the lineup  The lineup, yeah  Oh, I'm sorry  East Day, James Brown was there  Jamiroquai  Jamiroquai  Cheryl Crowe, DMX, Korn  And Bush went out after Korn  Right  Were they bigger than Korn? 
[02:42:30]  Bush had a lot more hits than Korn  Bush was more mainstream  Then there's the emerging artist stage  I actually like Bush  And we went and saw them  When we were up in Boston  And I was so fucking frustrated  Because you couldn't hear them  Because  The girls were screaming  The girls literally screamed the entire time  For what's his name  Gavin  Gavin  Oh, by the way  I don't know  That might not be the order  That was alphabetically listed on that day  Moby was there  Ice Cube  Los Lobos  Everclear  Ice Cube  Let's go to Evan in Albany 
[02:43:00]  Evan  Hey, what's up guys  Hey  What's up 94  You know  Primus was up stage  And of course  Their most famous song  Is My Name Is Mud  Right  Oh yeah  That must have  Did they start the mud thing?  Oh my god  Did they start the mud thing?  Is it better than the Green Day video?  Well, Green Day threw it back  So I don't know if it's better  But it's  I think there's a video on YouTube  If you guys want to check it out  Yeah, I want to see Primus  My Name Is Mud  At Woodstock 94  You're saying?  Megadeth 
[02:43:30]  Collective song  Well, I opened a big ass can of worms  With that one, didn't I?  Yeah  I'll riff up  My Name Is Mud  My Name Is Mud  Keep the mud to yourself  You son of a bitch  Oh, no  Sorry  See, that never works  Oh  I'm greening Smith  Tried that tactic  Yeah  I was thinking  That wasn't a smart thing  For him to say earlier  Oh, no  It's a sign  Of small and insignificant genitalia  Oh, boy 
[02:44:00]  I wouldn't do that  Good luck, Les  Do they pay attention to him?  No  My Name Is Mud  I'm the people who's a villain  Jack of Eden  That is my name is Mud  It's always well  He's like  Oh, he's tentative  Cause I'm the most boring  So it's a bitch  You've never seen  Someone's saying 
[02:44:30]  They act like a bunch of babies  While people threw mud at them  Then walked off  Really?  Is that what happened?  He obviously wanted everyone to throw mud  As he was saying that  Gotta get them in the ground  Before it starts to smell  My name is Mud  I don't think he wanted to be  I don't think he wanted to be  Pumped healthy with mud  Jesus Christ 
[02:45:00]  Bunch of maniacs  Bunch of maniacs  Yeah  Is this 99?  Looking at a lot of traitors in that audience  Know why?  Why?  They said fuck rock  And started listening to hip hop  Bunch of fucking traitors  Oh, man  What year was this one?  94  94  Oh, that 25 year old kid's 45 now  Oh, boy  The mud's thrown 
[02:45:30]  As good as the green day  Of course  A listener giving us a suggestion  I like fucking  I just like to hear  The primus  They do a cover  He does a cover of  Electric Funeral  Sabbath song  From fucking like  What was it?  What was the other big festival?  Don Corleone  Yeah  What was it?  There's another one  Live Aid  You got the  Bonnaroo  Bonnaroo  Oh, yeah  And I fucking  I like his little stage movements  I kind of like 
[02:46:00]  What was it?  Les Claypool  I like him  Yeah  Let me say hi to Tommy in Canada  Tommy  Hey, how's it going?  Tommy  Welcome back, Tommy  Hey, you were just talking  Congratulations on your bitches  Congratulations on your bitches  Bitches  Yeah, yeah  But the men are going to  Kick your ass today at noon  Yeah  Let's go  Let's do this  You guys got to put on  Some bullshit cheer  Like they did  And you win  Jesus  What do you got? 
[02:46:30]  No, but  Yeah, you're talking about  Crowd involvement  In live shows  I was going to say  Like ACDC  Is wild  But if  The craziest one  I actually seen  Surprisingly enough  Was like  Paul McCartney  What?  When he does like  Hey Jude  And turns off all  Like turns on  All the lights  And all the music  Is off  And all you hear  Is the crowd  Just saying  People don't know  What they're saying  Is there a video  Of that online?  Oh, that's at the end  With a  I don't  I don't  I don't hate you  Yeah, you bet  That part was wild 
[02:47:00]  Metallica  Their last tour  I'd say  Beat out ACDC  And I think it's just  To do with the crowd  That you're with  Right?  Like the type of people  So in that turn  The fucking motley crew crowd  Is always pretty wild  For that  Yeah  ACDC  This is a video  Of them doing  Thunderstruck  Where the audience  Participation  Is ridiculous  It's at Donington  Is that the one?  Yeah, it's at Donington  Can we see that again?  DVD  What year is that?  I don't know  I wonder if it's like  Heyday or 
[02:47:30]  62  Oh no  It's relatively recent  It's not their heyday  Is it 91?  Oh my god  Is it that long?  Is Thunderstruck  That fucking old?  Oh yeah  Thunderstruck's an old song  Is it really that old?  Is this the one?  Yes it is  This is 91?

Nah, not real.  It's alright.  I like the chorus.  They're in a tunnel.  And not New York City.  Yeah, that's actually less traffic than you'd normally see.  Since there's a band playing. 
[02:52:30]  Man, phone's lit.  Jesus.  John in Wisconsin.  John.  Hey, Chad.  Yo.  Yo, what's going on, Owen, eh?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  You guys remember the child of the 80s, man.  Live Aid, 1984.  Yeah.  Queen.  Wembley Stadium.  Wembley.  One of the best performances ever.  What song, though?  Radio Gaga, when they all clapped all the same time.  Holy shit.  Terrible song, though.  Yeah, I don't love that song.  Let's see, man. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, it's fucking amazing.  What if they're all clapping at the same time in 84?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Freddie Mercury always held that mic stand.  He has a mini mic stand you would hold.  Another one with a tucked in fucking tent.  Oh, boy.  How did we just not pay much attention?  To his gayness.  Wow, is he gay.  They do so many better songs, I think, during this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That fucking mustache. 
[02:53:30]  How many miles a cup?  Miles, right?  1,100.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:54:00]  It's fucking amazing.  Live.  You made us feel like we could fly.  So don't become some background noise.  A backdrop for the girl above us.  Look at them stoppers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, there's a chain.  It's just a flame.  When you're not dead. 
[02:54:30]  And you cry.  And you cry.  Well, that Wembley holds a lot of people.  Yes, it does.  We play gallants until...  No, you didn't.  Radio booboo.  There you go.  Are we here?  Radio booboo.  Radio booboo.  Radio booboo.  Radio booboo.  Are we here?  Radio booboo.  I don't like this song.  No.  They do a version of We Are The Champion. 
[02:55:00]  He has such a nice fucking voice live.  Like, he really could belt it out live.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Drew in Pennsylvania.  Drew.  Hey, boys.  Hey, precious Jim.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that the 90s stank.  They were awful.  Yeah, I didn't like them for music, dude.  What was wrong?  Really?  Well, corn and tool and Limp Bizkit and all that was awful.  Maybe I was, like, behind the times, but in the 90s, I was still doing, like, Judas Priest and Megadeth.  How old are you, Drew?  I'm 10.  You're 30? 
[02:55:30]  30, yeah.  He's listening to, like, hair bands in the 90s.  Fuck yeah.  He looked a little silly.  I don't know.  I like the 90s.  And, you know, music should have passed it by already, you know?  I don't know, man.  That corn business was not for me.  And everyone was all into Bush because that guy was good looking.  That corn business.  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  I got to go to work.  No worries.  You didn't like the 90s.  It's crazy.  I like the 90s.  I liked the...  The 90s were good.  I liked the 70s a lot, too. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, funky.  80s, not so much.  80s sucked.  80s were a little rough, but...  Pop music in the 80s was good.  Like, fucking catchy.  Like, that...  80s rock, though, was brutal.  New wave shit.  The new wave, yeah.  You had U2 and stuff in there, but in general, there was a lot of weird Casios and...  Like, 60s pop.  You weren't really supposed to play guitar in the 80s for some reason.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  You'd get a lot of weird keyboards.  Right.  You know, you get shit like that. 
[02:56:30]  Even the Eagles documentary, they went through their solo careers a little bit, and they all  had to start solo careers in 80, 81, when they broke up the first time.  And all of a sudden, you're looking at Glenn Frey, like, you're the same fucking guy.  You had the bright-colored fucking...  I know, yeah.  Blazers and the weird pants and the ties.  All of a sudden, there was, like, the skinny tie.  Skinny tie.  You're a dude from the Eagles, really?  Yeah.  You had to do that to fit in, I guess.  Some people did. 
[02:57:00]  They just, like, completely sold out.  Right.  Yeah.  I went to an ACDC show, and they had to check the building for structural damage.  I would bet they would do that beforehand.  Right?  So it doesn't shake anything loose.  I guess after.  They want to make sure they didn't knock any fucking bolts out.  That should be...  Me and my friend said before we went to a concert, what do you guys want to do?  Let's go shake those rafters, and then we'd high-five.  Ooh.  Oh, could you imagine  seeing two guys do that?  Let's go to Kevin. 
[02:57:30]  It's the Kevin, right?  No, it's Kevin.  The Kevin?  No.  We know a few Kevins up there.  What's going on?  No, one of my first concerts was ACDC,  and it was in the new Fleet Center,  which is now the Garden.  Sure.  And because they play so loud,  they brought in structural engineers, like, the next day  and had to check the building to make sure they didn't crack anything.  Oh, fuck.  I would think they would check it beforehand,  because some shit could be shaken loose. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, they didn't expect them to bring out six Civil War cannons  for those about to rock.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  They had that, and then Angus wails on a massive Liberty-style bell  for Hell's Bells, which is insane.  I've seen them twice.  I saw them at Foxboro, and they weren't nearly as loud.  What a pain in the ass did you have to travel around  with six Civil War cannons for your show.  Who's responsible for that?  Well, you should see when they play a whole lot of Rosie, 
[02:58:30]  they have a three-story tall fat pig woman blow-up doll  that inflates behind them when they play.  It's insane.  Yeah, they're amazing live.  I wouldn't know from firsthand experience,  but what I've seen, of course, on the YouTube.  Thank you, Kevin.  All right.  All right, brother.  Let's go to Sean in Palo Alto.  Sean.  Hey.  And Alto, how are you?  I'm very good.  It's fantastic out here.  Palo Alto.  So, when we first hit grunge in high school, 
[02:59:00]  you know, like in the early 90s,  my first experience was actually a Pearl Jam concert,  and we were in this place called The Pit in Albuquerque,  and it was the first time to be in a mosh pit,  and I had no idea the kind of action that went down there,  so I had this freaking humongous plate of nachos  from the concession stand,  and then when Butthole Surfers came out  and the whole crowd kind of nice and calm,  and then he fired off this fake shotgun  and the mosh pit started.  Yeah, I got pushed, 
[02:59:30]  and all those nachos went over all the freaking chicks  in front of me, all in their backs,  and then the plate of nachos slides down the floor,  and it's just this freaking jalapeno cheesy mess.  What are you saying?  Is this Beavis?  And then I had my nachos,  and why do you have nachos?  I got on this chick I thought I was going to score, right?  Why do you have nachos near a mosh pit?  Dude, I had no idea that mosh pit was so exhausting  and that you don't wear nice clothes, 
[03:00:00]  there's no point in showering or looking good.  It was just a disaster.  Why is there no place to sit in this mosh pit?  Exactly.  We leave the table service?  Right.  No place.  No, you don't leave.  You can't use the bathroom.  Once you're in, you're in,  and then the Pearl Jam was just amazing,  and I was hooked ever since.  It's the greatest decade.  I don't screw that.  Fuck that guy.  It's the greatest.  Grunge is absolutely the greatest decade.  Okay.  There were some strong bands in the 90s, I thought.  Hey, what do I know? 
[03:00:30]  All right, Sean.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  The story of the nachos in the mosh pit.  Yeah, how many times do you kill that at parties?  In like a button-down shirt,  like carrying his nachos into the mosh pit.  It's nachos.  Hey, everyone.  He's getting hit.  Hey, hey.  Excuse me.  Hey, what are you doing?  You're spilling my treat.  What an idiot.  Trying to find the manager in an usher.  Ha, ha, manager.  Recognize your face.  What's your name?  That's pretty good. 
[03:01:00]  I liked that Jess Greenberg's version of Highway to Hell.  Oh, can we play that?  Now, she had a good version of Highway to Hell.  Who's Jess Greenberg?  She's just some girl.  She's the girl.  Oh, that hot chick?  Yeah, from England.  Dude, I was wondering what happened to her yesterday.  With the high forehead.  Yes.  Oh, that's right.  You don't like her forehead, remember?  No, she doesn't have a high forehead.  It's just the way it's videoed.  She's shot with a giant skull in half.  Look at this cleavage. 
[03:01:30]  It has nine million views.  Of course it does, because she's an amazing musician.  So incredibly hot.  And a giant head.  We'll play this in a break.  She doesn't have a giant head.  Not for a monster.  No.  Let me see a little.  We got Ty West.  We do have to take a break, because I ain't staying late today.  Fuck that.  But I just want to see a little of it on the air.  Go ahead.  Let's say heck instead of heck.  I have to.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Fire.  Fire away.  Oh, my God.  Wow, she has big tits.  She does. 
[03:02:00]  Look at the lips, though, too.  She's so pretty.  When she finally looks up.  A little pouty.  Oh, definitely pouty.  Yeah, exactly.  She's wearing an Astro Rose fucking bandana.  Oh, my God.  Look at those eyes.  She's singing this song to me.  This could be the most beautiful girl in the world.  Yes.  From the eyebrows down.  Oh, come on.  I don't care if they zoomed up or panned up and you saw Frankenstein's head up after there. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, my God.  She doesn't want anything to do with us.  We reached out to her after we started talking about her video.  England.  She's young, only 17.  She's young.  17, 18 years.  Here you go.  I defy anybody to say anything bad about her.  Okay, she's a big, long fucking time capsule head.  No, she doesn't.  It's a fucking time release fucking ass frame. 
[03:03:00]  It's just the way it's framed.  Yes, that's why they do that.  No, it's not.  They know that's her fault.  I've seen pictures of her and her head.  You shut up, Jimmy.  I'm white knighting.  She looks like, no.  Yeah, yeah.  She should be fucking carrying your cookbook, how to serve humans.  It was called to serve men.  Look at the boobies bouncing.  Oh, her tits are fantastic.  Oh, my God.  Every picture in her head cuts off.  Jess Greenberg. 
[03:03:30]  Yes.  She's beautiful.  Every picture.  No.  Believe me.  No.  Her nickname is Skull McGillicott.  No.  No.  No.  Look at those eyes.  Yeah.  And her mouth.  Now back to the pouty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, a little freestyle.  She has a head shape like the guy that tortured Mel Gibson in the original Leave the Land.  I don't know.  Jimmy.  Leave her alone.  Every photo. 
[03:04:00]  You're going to read it.  Because they're all from her videos.  Right.  That's why.  No.  They frame it like that.  I don't know why.  I do.  I have to guess.  No.  She doesn't have a giant head.  Okay.  Here we go.  I want to leave her head.  I want to leave her head.  Wait, wait, wait.  Look at that.  She's hot.  But look at that giant skull.  No.  Am I right or wrong, Sam?  No.  She has a head like Sam.  No.  Yeah, that's a six head.  Shut up.  Does she have new videos since the last time we looked at her? 
[03:04:30]  I think she does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She posts a lot.  She's self-conscious about her forehead.  She is.  Big foreheads.  No big foreheads.  No.  What's her latest song?  She hasn't uploaded in a while, huh?  Well.  Yeah.  She's a bust.  Image search her.  Image search her.  I think she's getting famous on that big head of hers.  Yeah.  Just image search.  Other media.  And you'll watch.  Every photo is like that.  That's abnormal.  No one chops their head in half for no reason.  But.  But watch.  Watch.  There's a couple.  Go on that one right there.  Where you can see her from the side. 
[03:05:00]  She's profiling.  Look.  She's got a great head.  She has a fucking long forehead.  Holy shit.  Look at that fucking.  Oh.  No.  Don't even.  Look at that.  Look how big that forehead is.  Yeah.  She's not conscious about it.  It's fine.  That's fine.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  What a good target though, huh?  Sure.  Just fucking hit that.  Yeah.  She's like con with big tits.  Come on.  We got to take a break.  Ty West up next.  Stay there.  Got Ty West outside the studio. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Let's bring Ty in.  Yeah.  I don't know if they can hear us outside the studio.  He is a director.  A director.  His new movie is called The Sacrament.  Yes.  The Sacrament follows a group of journalists shooting a doc about a man's attempt to locate  his missing sister.  They find her in a role cult preparing for a mass suicide.  Wait.  This is a...  Oh, it's a movie.  It makes creepy movies.  The Sacrament will be released.  Video on demand on May 1st, 2014 and in theaters June 6th. 
[03:06:00]  Why don't we bring him in?  He's right outside the studio.  Come on in.  Come on in, Ty West.  Come on in.  Ty, how you doing?  Take a seat.  Did we ever ask you if that's your real name, Ty?  I mean, your given name?  I don't know if you did.  It's not.  It is and it isn't.  It's short for my mom's maiden name.  Tiberius?  No, it's Tymon, which is just some Irish nonsense.  Which I would suggest...  Exactly.  If you were to name your kid something that...  Like, there was never any intention for me to be called anything other than Ty, so why 
[03:06:30]  not?  So why not Ty?  Because then every...  Like, all my IDs, all roll call in school, it's always a thing.  Oh.  And then this is, like, harsh.  But...  So then, like, The Lion King came out somewhere when I was, like, a teenager.  And then that...  The things I used to say is, like, Timon or something.  Timon.  Which is spelled the same way.  So, I spent a good, like, ten years of, like, is it Timon?  Is it spelled the same way as Timon?  I don't know.  I think it's probably very close.  It's very close.  Oh, man.  That would have been a little...  Timon.  Yeah, that would have been very inconvenient to end school.  That's a black name, Timon, right? 
[03:07:00]  That'll get you a couple of punches for no fucking reason.  Yeah, you might get caught with some.  I just read the description of the sacrament.  It sounds pretty cool.  Yes, it's a hitman who mixes murder and daddy-daughter bonding in a ludicrous spy paper.  Jimmy was going off during the commercials about how he hates that movie about assassins.  Look at that photo.  What is that?  Custer playing a fucking assassin.  Can these assholes stop playing assassins in their late 50s?  Fucking him and Liam Neeson.  One more mission. 
[03:07:30]  Fuck you.  You don't like the one more mission angle?  I'm so tired of it.  No?  I just got to come back out of retirement and do this one more thing.  Foreign.  A foreign mission to get the guys.  Oh, fuck yourself.  That sounds like a good movie.  Because he kind of hates his retirement, right?  Knows all the old tricks.  Right.  He's got to call up his old buddies.  He'll show the young guys a thing or two.  And he talks his old buddies into it, and then one of his old buddies has to die. 
[03:08:00]  Right, of course.  The new one is that non-stop, right, where he's on the plane?  Yes.  Which to me just translates as, I'll do another taken, but I don't want to go to Europe.  Right.  Because there's something we can just shoot in L.A. in three weeks.  And they're like, we've got a movie on a plane.  And he's like, great, I'll meet you at the studio.  They set it up all on a soundstage.  Right.  He's just tired of Budapest and traveling all around.  Taken on a plane.  Yeah, that's the new one where, what is he?  Somebody's dying.  There's an assassin on the plane.  Why wouldn't there be an assassin?  And texting about it. 
[03:08:30]  And texting.  It just seems like that would be an easy thing to not have happen.  Why would you want to do it on a plane?  Because it's amazing.  Wouldn't it be easier to do it, of course, other ways?  And the way they'll shoot it, like, they'll make it look like there's all these little places to hide.  Right.  It's one long aisle.  Yeah.  An assassin can never hide in an aisle.  But there's always compartments in the plane that don't exist.  Right.  Like some weird underground, like, section where, like, the pilots take naps.  And it's like, I don't think those are real.  There'll be a scene where they're hiding and whispering. 
[03:09:00]  They're walking around underneath where everyone's sitting.  Like, enough headroom.  Yeah.  They're walking.  And there's, like, cages of equipment and dials and all kinds of stuff for you to have a fight.  Can you get there from the plane or you have to go from the outside?  Of course not.  Who knows?  I don't even know.  I can also say, as a filmmaker, having made movies in either a hotel or a house or things like that,  you very quickly early on go, where the fuck am I going to put the camera?  Because you run, like, every scene is like, here's another room.  So on a plane, after day one of shooting, you've got to just be like, well, we could, all right, put it over by this seat. 
[03:09:30]  There's just no way.  Every shot looks the same after the first day of shooting.  You would have to, what a boring, I guess, you know, passenger, passenger 57 was pretty good for that kind of movie.  Is that the Wesley Snipes vehicle?  The Wesley Snipes vehicle.  I heard it say vehicle.  I heard he made a lot of money on that one.  He just didn't pay any taxes on that.  No, he didn't pay the taxes, though.  I don't watch that whole goddamn thing.  But I want to talk about your movie.  The Sacrament.  Come on, goddamn it. 
[03:10:00]  And I said, the trailer comes out today, but I, so it comes out later today, but I sent Sam a link.  So somewhere in here, there's a link to it that you can watch.  But why don't we watch it now, right in front of you?  Yeah, and I don't have to explain it.  I mean, that would be super easy.  We'll just be like, whoa!  We'll have to explain it, because it's radio.  That's true.  Do we have that link?  But we won't.  We'll just go, whoa!  Shit!  Is it scary?  It's scary-ish.  So it's about, like, it's about guys from Vice that go to do a story about this commune in the middle of nowhere.  And they go there because they're looking for a friend of their sister. 
[03:10:30]  Wait, is this a fictional guys from Vice, or are they real?  It's actually Vice.  It's not actually them.  They're actors playing them.  But they work for Vice in the movie.  Okay.  And Vice said cool?  Yeah.  It's not really about Vice, so I think that's why they said cool.  It doesn't really editorialize about them.  It could be, like, it starts with them being like, okay, we're at Vice, and we're going to go do this story.  And that's about the extent of the Vice.  It's just, to me, Vice are the people that are doing the most interesting video journalism right now.  Oh, hell yeah.  And also, Vice, I think, doesn't have a, like, political slant.  Like, if it was MSNBC going to do it, there would be, like, an agenda. 
[03:11:00]  Or Fox, there would be a thing.  And them, they're just like, we're going to go check it out.  Right.  And I wanted to use a real brand because the movie's, like, pretty heavy, and it's, like, a Jonestown type movie.  So, like, when you're done watching the movie, hopefully it sort of, like, resonates with you a little bit.  And if there's a real brand in the movie, hopefully then when you're walking on the street and you see something that says Vice, it kind of brings you back to it.  And the movie has a lot of, like, social and political and religious stuff in it.  So, because it deals with all these, like, socially relevant things, I think it was cool to have, like, a real, like, news brand. 
[03:11:30]  It's because Vice is becoming, like, a real news brand.  Yeah.  They are.  Yeah.  So, there's this kind of Jonestown-y kind of thing.  Yeah, I mean, it's very Jonestown-y.  You'll see in the trailer.  So, it's like they go, a friend of their sister joined this commune, and he hasn't heard from her for a while.  So, they're like, well, we've got to go do a story about that.  So, they go and they get there and they find her.  And it's this very Jonestown-like community built in the middle of nowhere.  And it's just some foreign locale.  I didn't give it a specific name.  Right.  You know, it didn't necessarily matter, but it looks quite similar to, like, Guyana. 
[03:12:00]  A little jungle-ish.  And we actually shot in Georgia, but it looks foreign.  And so, they get there and everything's cool.  And all the people they talk to, it's like, it's a little weird and they're a little religious and they're a little, like, socialist and groovy and whatever.  But everyone seems happy and everyone basically is like, look, it sucked before.  And, yeah, this is weird, but it's better than what we had before.  And so, their kind of initial take on it is like, well, it's weird, but, you know, whatever.  And so, then they meet the kind of the leader, whoever he calls father, which is, of course, always a bad sign. 
[03:12:30]  That's never good.  Yeah.  And so, they have this big interview with him and he kind of gives the pitch of why this place is great.  In a very Jim Jones-like fashion in that it's like, you know, America's going downhill and this is where we should all be.  And these people are suffering and they're not suffering here and this is what it's all about.  Well, this sounds like a nice enough place.  Yeah.  And so, then you get to the second half of the movie where not all that's true.  And much like Jonestown, you know, some people want to leave.  And, you know, if you're just a journalist, like in Jonestown, it was Congressman Leo Ryan and NBC went down there. 
[03:13:00]  So, there were journalists, but there was also a congressman who was like, we're here to make sure it's cool and if it's not, take you out of here if you want to go.  Did anybody want to leave with a congressman?  He was having none of that.  So, in actual Jonestown, what happened is, you know, these people, 900 people moved to Guyana and it wasn't cell phones.  There was no way to communicate with them.  So, all their family members were like, we don't know if they're okay.  What the fuck are they doing?  And meanwhile, back in San Francisco, all these exposés were coming out about Jim Jones and the People's Temple not being what it was supposed to be and that there was maybe beatings going on and drug use and it was a bad thing. 
[03:13:30]  So, the relatives got concerned and Congressman Ryan took it on as his mission to say, I'm going to go down there and I'm going to make sure everything's okay.  And if it's not, I'm going to bring whoever wants to come back, back.  And they went down there and everything seemed great.  Everybody was kind of put on a show that everyone wanted to be there.  And then a few people wanted to leave and they were going to take them.  And then the following morning, more people wanted to leave.  And then as more people wanted to leave, more people wanted to leave. 
[03:14:00]  People started getting, like, more confidence to say, yeah, I don't want to be here either because they'd seen people say – because no one wanted to be the first person to say it because they were all scared.  So, once one person said it, then two people and it started – and then things started getting out of control where, like, the loyalists to People's Temple and Jim Jones were like, you can't leave.  And then a mom would want to leave with her kid, but the dad would want to stay with the kid.  And so there would be, like, a custody battle happening, like, in the front yard, pulling the kids and saying, you can't take them out of here.  And all that sort of culminated into someone attacking Congressman Ryan. 
[03:14:30]  And he was okay.  They stopped it.  And they got out of there.  And so they went to the airfield to leave.  And they were taking everyone that was with them going to leave also.  And then they said, we're going to come back with another plane.  And anyone who wants to go, we can go.  And then some loyalists from Jim Jones came and shot everybody at the airfield.  And they killed Congressman Ryan.  They killed the cameraman from NBC and a lot of the people who wanted to leave.  Some people made it out into the jungle.  The jig was up at that point.  And so then after that, back at the sort of Jonestown compound, Jim Jones said, like, look, you know, this is the end.  Like, we've built this whole utopia here. 
[03:15:00]  And it's all going to go away.  And someone killed the Congressman.  And the government's going to come down here and slaughter us all.  It'd be better if we just went peacefully.  And that's where the sort of drinking the Kool-Aid thing came from.  Now, let me ask you.  Did anyone survive that or no?  Yes, a few people did.  How?  By faking the drinking or they just didn't kill them?  Oh, yeah.  No, anyone that drank had died.  And a lot of people, there's this idea that it was a mass suicide, which it was.  But it was also a mass murder because these people didn't really have a choice.  You couldn't just be like, no, thanks.  I'm just going to.  Well, like everyone, you know, while your your friends, your family, your children are dying around you from drinking poison. 
[03:15:30]  And there's guys with guns and people who don't want it are being injected with poison.  And you and you're in the middle of the jungle in Guyana in 1978.  It's not like, where are you going to go?  You know, you can't just walk out of there.  I know they injected people.  Yeah.  So there was this.  It just was a very hopeless situation.  So some people didn't drink it and ran away, but not very many.  Only a handful of people.  And then a few people on the airstrip survived.  Isn't that amazing how drink the Kool-Aid became like something to say?  That's the big thing with this movie.  Kool-Aid must have hated that. 
[03:16:00]  It was fucking quick.  I'm sure someone at Kool-Aid was like Flavor-Aid.  Just call it Flavor-Aid.  Yeah.  Wow.  But it's a really kind of amazing American tragedy that isn't, it's just turned into  pop culture.  It's turned into everyone's like, oh, drink the Kool-Aid.  Yeah.  But it's really like, oof, 900 people were murdered.  You know, it's now just a goof.  When they flew over and the people that initially saw them thought that they were having a picnic  because it's very colorful.  It almost looked like a quilt.  All bodies just laying on top of each other. 
[03:16:30]  And what's so very disturbing is that when they initially flew over, they thought, okay,  400 people have been killed, but there's another 400 or 500 out in the jungle somewhere that  survived.  And then they realized that people were laying on top of each other.  Yeah, they were.  And they're piles up.  Amazing.  That's some crazy shit.  Where'd you film your film?  We started in Savannah, Georgia, because filmmaking is on sale in Georgia.  Ah, nice.  Yeah.  Gotta go where the locations are cheap.  Yeah.  Well, so you get like 30% tax credit back.  So you go there.  And then they promise you, like, we have everything here.  And you get there, and they have nothing there. 
[03:17:00]  And so you end up bringing it all in, and it kind of balances itself out.  But for us, Savannah was good because we shot in, like, the fall, and it's still warm  down there in the fall.  And we were able to plant some palm trees and some, like, banana plants and stuff to  make it look jungly.  Yeah.  Did you ever see that cult movie with Christy McNichol and Jimmy McNichol?  It was, like, a TV movie years ago, and they...  Is that the one with James Woods?  Ah, I'm not even sure.  This is so old, and they send... 
[03:17:30]  It's, like, it's mostly about how they deprogram the people.  They kidnap them and bring them back.  And Jimmy McNichol was going for an Emmy at the time, I think, because he was really  hamming it up.  He was terrific, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Really hooked on it.  Cult, yeah, cults were, like, a big, like, issue back after Jonestown and stuff.  Well, it's weird because, like, you know, in the 60s and 70s, it was such, like, a revolutionary  time.  Right.  And, you know, I think today is similar.  It's not, like, you know, we have the internet, so it's, like, you're quick to give up on 
[03:18:00]  everything, and no one really needs to commit because it's so easy to just communicate.  Wait, what?  Exactly.  But, you know, in the 60s and 70s, there was this idea, like, post-Vietnam, that just,  like, things weren't great here.  So, like, what if we try something else?  Right.  And if you're someone who's, like, I can't pay my bills and everything sucks, and then,  yeah, it's weird to go live on this compound with these people, but I don't have to worry  about everything.  Like, it's a camp all the time.  And, yeah, I've got to build some stuff, but for the most part, I'm just living my life,  and that's what it's all about.  Man.  Man. 
[03:18:30]  Man, it sounds like a, you know, a viable option.  But what always happens with cults is that there's someone in charge, and the person  in charge says, look, you know, sex is a bad idea, so you shouldn't be having sex because  it just messes up everyone's head, so let's not do that.  And everyone's like, well, okay.  And he's like, but if you really need to, I'm here to have, I will fall on that sword  for you.  Right.  And that's where it begins.  And then, you know, there's such narcissism of being, like, the center of people. 
[03:19:00]  It becomes a problematic environment.  That sex thing really is a bitch with those cults.  Yeah.  They love having sex with the women and their daughters.  With the numbers.  Yeah, that's got to make a little bad will.  Yeah.  Let's say.  And, you know, in the case of Jonestown, it just, it really snowballed out of control.  Yeah.  You know, they had built this.  Also, everyone gives up all their money to join something like that.  Right, that's another thing.  You've got to give up your wealth and stuff.  Which, again, this just sounds all groovy. 
[03:19:30]  And then, when you're in a situation where you don't want to do it anymore, you're like,  well, everyone I know is here.  I don't have any money.  Like, when people think about, well, how would they do that in Guyana?  It's like, well, one, how do you get out of there?  Right.  And if everyone you know is dead, what, like, you're going to find some way to walk to  some village to find some way to get to a plane that will take you back to America with  no passport, with no money, like, you're just going to be homeless with no friends.  Like, that's, so it's kind of like, well, if this is, if this is painless, and everyone's  going, and maybe there's heaven, why not? 
[03:20:00]  You know, and so I think that that's something that, for me, with this movie is, is what  it's mostly about.  Isolationism is a huge part of the cult thing.  You know, you got to keep them, uh, separate, keep them separated.  What, what about, uh, what did you think about that other cult?  What was that?  That with the crazy fucking whitehead was his name?  Oh, Marshall.  What's amazing is that their jobs were, they were like, they were like website designers.  That's where they made all their money.  It's like early days, web design.  That's so weird.  What year was that they did that?  I want to say it was 93, but I could be wrong. 
[03:20:30]  Marshall White Apple.  White Apple.  That was it.  And he's castration, right?  That's the one.  That's 20 years ago.  20, 21 years ago.  Yeah, Hale-Bopp.  Hale-Bopp, Hale-Bopp Comet.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a spaceship behind it, and it's going to take us to, uh, paradise.  What the fuck would buy into paradise?  What idiocy?  So cut your balls off, and let's fucking get out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How dumb.  So I'm guessing in, uh, your movie, um.  The Sacrament.  Yes.  It doesn't, it doesn't end up to be a good place to be. 
[03:21:00]  It does not.  Um, and, and much like I described with Jonestown, I used essentially, um, what happened in Jonestown,  as the model, as this sort of, like, history repeating itself kind of thing.  So it's an updated version, because I think that, while it's a very similar story to Jonestown,  and it looks a lot like Jonestown, which is on purpose, um, I think a lot of the reasons  people joined People's Temple in the 60s and 70s is still relevant today.  Right.  Um, and the difference is that, like, you know, somebody like Vice would be the kind  of people that would tell a story like this.  You know, they find these weird things.  Um. 
[03:21:30]  Either that, or the, you know, the guys that are having sex with, uh, animals out in the  field.  The donkeys.  The donkeys.  Um.  In Columbia.  In Columbia.  And so that, that's what made sense to me, and kind of, like, I guess reminding everyone  that, like, you know, it's harder to go off the grid now, and that's a big problem  for cults.  Yeah.  You know, it's, it's harder to, like, be in control because everybody's so connected.  Right.  Um, yep.  But I think that a lot of the, the reasons that people joined them and the problems  that happened with them are still just as relevant today.  So I think that, you know, it's like an updated version of it, but it follows the same.  It is a weird thing that, that, uh, communication has kind of fucked up, uh, the ability to isolate 
[03:22:00]  big groups of people like that.  Like, we know what's going on in, um, Kiev.  Right now.  Because.  Or Venezuela.  Yeah, Venezuela and stuff.  And they used to be able to, uh, just suppress the information.  And they could kill all those, but just fucking wipe them out.  Right.  But now it's like, uh, we're watching.  Twitter and texting.  We're watching, yeah.  And people are tweeting, and, and pictures are coming out of there.  So it is, it's a lot harder to be that, feel oppressive. 
[03:22:30]  You gotta be a sneaky fuck, uh, these days to, to really fuck people over.  Yeah.  I'm trying to start a cult of girls with big tits who like sucking my penis.  How do you think that's going to work out for you?  It's not well so far.  It's not so far?  No, I have an ad in the Village Voice.  Looking for girls with big tits who would like to suck my penis in my new cult.  In my new cult.  Give me all of your worldly belongings and then suck my penis.  Uh, well, where can, uh, where can people see this? 
[03:23:00]  Well, it hasn't happened.  Oh, no, Jimmy, not time.  You sacraments.  Back in the Village Voice.  Um, it, uh, premieres on VOD May 1st, and it comes out in theaters on June 6th.  Nice.  Uh, tonight we're having a screening at Lincoln Center, um, just to promote the movie.  Um, I believe it's sold out, um, but you can check out their website and see about that.  I think it's sold out, though.  Uh, good for you.  And then I'm just sort of traveling around, much like I am here in different cities, just  kind of promoting it.  Um, but yeah, VOD in May and, uh, theatrical in June.  And the trailer comes out this afternoon, so, um, I know there's a link floating around 
[03:23:30]  here somewhere.  Ty underscore West.  It's T-I underscore West on Twitter, so I'm sure you'll tweet links to the thing.  I will, yes.  There'll be, it's gonna be a big day of tweets.  Very fucking cool, man.  I can't wait to see it.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna hound Roland for the link and watch it, uh, tonight at home.  I would have been good in that movie, by the way.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  This is a cult!  You people must go!  I'll give, like, a big speech at the end.  I'm very good.  That is, wow, that is good. 
[03:24:00]  Amazing.  Yeah, I would walk in.  The last one to die.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck is going on here?  I think Jim Norton gets the and as credit in the movie.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton as.  Introducing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And introducing.  Yeah.  As Myrtle.  That's what I want my name to do.  Myrtle.  M-U-R-D-D-L-E-H.  Myrtle.  A horrible name, character, speech you give.  I'm in the sacrament and I, and I, and I, I give the big speech at the end. 
[03:24:30]  Dammit!  What about individuality?  Individuality.  So watch is just the same thing.  That's a terrible message for a cult, individuality.  Yeah, it's true.  Let's do it one more time.  Let's just tweak the ending there.  Yeah, let's change the dialogue a little there.  My note.  Ty, thanks for coming in.  We were obviously.  Always a pleasure.  Yeah, we were pressed this Friday.  But, yeah, great seeing you again and continued, as they say, success.  Thank you.  Next Friday, I'm in Pittsburgh. 
[03:25:00]  Pittsburgh.  Yeah, next Pittsburgh.  Next Friday, the 28th.  Two pickets to Titsburg.  Yeah, that nice vulgarity.  Sorry.  Let's go away to end the week.  I want to take this opportunity to thank you all for listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, as always, we as people enjoy the things we enjoy, but all good things must come to an end.  And as we reach the conclusion of the Opie and Anthony show, instead of being sad, we can look forward to what comes next. 
[03:25:30]  So remember to think of this not as the end of Dirty Jokes, but the beginning of the whole new set of ones.  Until next time, take care of yourself and each other.  Sam Roberts is coming up next. </pre>
