<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts lamenting the daily grind of radio, contrasting their schedule with the more relaxed pace of a weekly TV show like "Louie." Anthony then recounts a lengthy, humorous, and increasingly absurd saga of a raccoon infestation in his Long Island home, detailing his failed attempts at trapping the animals (accidentally catching his cat instead) and the ensuing chaos. This sparks a flurry of listener calls offering wildly varying, often brutal, raccoon removal strategies. The conversation expands to include other animals, humorous wildlife encounters (a bison charging a tourist in Yellowstone is mentioned), and a discussion of an upcoming Obama appearance on "The View," along with criticisms of Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  The hosts announce that Steven Adler of Guns N' Roses will be a guest later in the show.

Next, a caller, Ron from New Jersey, complains about a politician disrupting his town with a photo op for small business loans, prompting a highly offensive discussion about the politician and broader political issues.  The conversation shifts to racial humor, the midterm elections, and generational differences in political participation.  A significant portion of this segment is devoted to playing a series of increasingly angry and threatening voicemails from Santa Cain, who accuses the show's staff (Sam Roberts and Danny) and hosts of stealing her hat after a previous appearance.  The voicemails include death threats. The hat is eventually found in the studio. The segment also includes discussion about valuable items found at garage sales (including a story about a worker finding millions of dollars worth of Ansel Adams' negatives), anecdotes about lost Babe Ruth baseballs, and a brief call with the "Fugitive," a recurring show bit.  Steven Adler's impending guest appearance is again mentioned.


A substantial portion of the show is dedicated to a discussion on suicide and its aftermath, triggered by a news story about a man who jumped from a building onto a Starbucks table.  The hosts and callers discuss the various methods of suicide, the grim realities of suicide cleanup (detailed by a caller who works in the field), and the emotional impact on those left behind. This is followed by a preview of Steven Adler's new tell-all book, touching on his troubled relationship with his mother, drug abuse, and sexual assault.

Steven Adler then joins the show.  The interview focuses heavily on his struggles with addiction (acid, weed, cocaine, heroin), his time in Guns N' Roses, his complicated relationship with Axl Rose (including a $3,000 tequila-fueled reconciliation in Las Vegas), his financial difficulties, and his experiences with sexual abuse as a child. He discusses his time on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, his strained relationship with his bandmates (Slash, Duff McKagan, Izzy Stradlin), his isolation from the creative process in Guns N' Roses, and his desire to reconnect with Izzy Stradlin. He promotes his new book and his current band, Adler's Appetite. The interview ends with discussion of his sobriety and improved drumming skills.  The hosts use highly offensive language throughout this segment.

Following the Adler interview, the show plays several highly offensive and abusive voicemails from Mel Gibson directed at two different women.  The hosts and callers use highly offensive language while discussing the recordings and Gibson's behavior.  The first set of calls focuses on a seemingly contentious relationship ending badly, with Gibson unleashing insults. Speculation on the woman's motives and possible legal ramifications (including palimony) ensue. This is followed by another set of recordings, even more aggressive, with Gibson arguing with a woman identified as Sandy Cain.  The recordings are interspersed with listener calls, comedic tangents, and a discussion about the legality of recording phone conversations.  A caller updates the progress of "The Passion of Popeye," an unrelated animated audio project.  The hosts also discuss a birthday dinner and the calorie counts on the menu. The show concludes with the remaining portions of the Mel Gibson/Sandy Cain audio recordings.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  A box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about.  You're a no-good son of a bitch.  Fuck you motherfucker.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on, it's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Hola to our Spanish-speaking friends.  You think we got Spanish listeners?  Oh, yes.  Multilingual, I'd say.  Espa√±a.  Yep.  Let's do this.  Morning.  Rocking another Opie and Anthony show.  We sure are. 
[00:01:30]  We had a good show yesterday.  Yes, we did.  So why do we have to do it again today?  I know.  Can someone explain that to me?  Rerun yesterday's.  Fucking Louie has a great show on FX.  I mean, it's a great show.  Guess what?  He gets to wait a week to do another great show.  Yeah.  That's how it should be.  Imagine Louie has to do another great show today for FX.  I think that would suck.  That's nonsense.  That would be completely ridiculous.  Yeah.  But radio, we're scumbags. 
[00:02:00]  The lowest level of the entertainment fucking food chain.  So we have to pump out shows all day long.  Like a fucking chocolate factory.  We are truly the scourge.  It's unbelievable.  But, you know, I think about it that way sometimes.  But then I think about the listener, Opie, and think they deserve.  They don't need half this horse shit either.  Give them one solid great show, and then they could, like, kind of hang out with the show for a week. 
[00:02:30]  Like, they'll be talking about Louie's show for about a week.  They'll be replaying their favorite clips, because you could do that now.  It's all over the Internet.  And then they get excited for the next show.  Yeah.  Just put it on and try it on for a week.  The listeners would agree.  They don't need half this horse shit.  Fuck you.  Maybe 60% of the show is worth replaying.  Fuck you.  Get in there.  You lazy.  Get in there.  There is a lot going on today, though. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I saw that.  You were telling me that you got raccoons.  We should start with that, man.  You got raccoons in a really nice house out there on Long Island.  God.  The compound has raccoons.  You know, I've been defending against the wrong thing for so many years.  And raccoons have taken up residence in my attic.  That might just be a little karma, man.  You think? 
[00:03:30]  You make fun of raccoons all the time.  Well, yeah.  And now all of a sudden you got raccoons in your what?  In your attic?  Well, in my attic, at first they've been knocking over bail boxes, driving through people's  backyards.  They've been knocking over my garbage pails and foraging through my garbage.  And, you know, that's really fucking annoying.  But at least they're not in the house.  Now, I noticed this kind of weird, if the bedroom gets warm, it's this weird musty smell. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, shit.  And I'm like, I am not into fucking smells.  You're changing the sheets, right, after these weekends?  Oh, of course.  After these weekends of yours?  Changing them.  I throw them out.  All right, good.  I think that's the raccoons marking their territory.  I'm no expert, but I think they have basically said to themselves, this is our house.  This is ours.  And we need to mark everything.  Well, they have.  So other raccoons and other things don't live here. 
[00:04:30]  They absolutely have.  They went upstairs.  Are you sure they're not wandering around your house in the middle of the night?  Just the attic.  Look for droppings.  Just the attic.  I did.  And the exterminator did.  Oh, okay.  Because I had an exterminator come over.  Lickety split.  Of course.  And he went through the attic and said, yeah, there's droppings, which is shit.  I got raccoon shit in my attic.  But the guy's up there.  The raccoons have to be up there.  No, not in the daytime.  Where the fuck are they going during the daytime? 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  They always say if you see a raccoon during the daytime, he's sick.  Yeah, but then at night, like in the morning, they'll leave.  They like have a schedule, like me.  Nah, you sure they're leaving?  Yes, they leave in the morning.  They go out.  They do their shit.  Then they fucking like, I don't know what they do.  They go somewhere.  They do all their shit in the night.  Yeah, but they leave at like five in the morning.  They leave the house.  That's what this guy's telling you?  They come in.  Yeah, and then they're in and out during the night.  Maybe they got a summer home.  Doing their shenanigans. 
[00:05:30]  Maybe they do.  What are they doing?  Maybe they're at a neighbor's house.  Shit, dude.  You might have sick raccoons if they're leaving in the morning.  No.  No.  Or maybe they're going to another part of the house.  No, I haven't seen any evidence of raccoons in the house.  This is really strange.  The exterminator went up and found droppings.  How many does he think are living up in the attic?  I don't know, a couple.  A couple, but then they have a few little ones probably.  When I walked out one day about a month and a half ago, I found a little raccoon walking 
[00:06:00]  across the lawn, and he was looking at me as he's walking, and then he gives me this passing  look like, what the fuck are you doing in my house?  That's how he looked at me.  And now I got to deal with this.  So I set, well, the exterminator set up traps around the garbage where they usually fuck  around, and then the exterminator's coming back with a ladder that he didn't have a big 
[00:06:30]  tall ladder to look up where he thinks they're getting in.  So he's got to seal that shit up.  Why can't they just seal houses?  Especially new ones when they're building them.  I know.  What do you mean he sees where they're coming in?  He thinks there might be a place where that round turret-y thing meets the square roof.  Which, you know, I want to kill my builder for fucking leaving that.  Has to be, right?  Yeah, it's got to be.  Is it by a tree?  Or are they going up to the roof with fire? 
[00:07:00]  They'll climb up anything, most things.  They'll use anything to climb up.  They're amazing.  Little magical creatures.  Are they as bad as possums, though?  Or as disgusting as possums?  Yeah, they're just as bad.  They're cute, is the problem.  The problem is they're cute, but I would imagine they do a hell of a lot more damage than possums.  Destructive, shit like that.  You could run over a possum, and it'll pretty much just keep walking.  Yeah, yeah.  They are.  I've run over a possum before.  Horrible things.  Just the thud it makes.  Do you call them a possum or an old possum? 
[00:07:30]  Huh?  Do you call them possums or old possums?  Old possums.  I hate the O in front.  I saw an old possum.  So I have traps set, and so last night before I go to bed, I figure, let me check the trap.  I go out there.  Isn't that creepy, checking traps, though?  Yeah, a little bit.  When I was catching mice in my old apartment, it was always creepy to go check the traps.  Check the trap.  Well, these are humane traps.  Aw.  You should get a bear trap.  They catch them, and they catch them in those little wire traps. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  And then the thing's like, whaah, like hisses at you and gets all pissed off.  Yeah.  And I poke at him with a stick and then throw the trap in the pool.  But I check the trap, and I see these shiny eyes looking back at me, and the trap is shut.  I'm like, nice.  So as I walk up, there's a little kitty in my trap.  Oh, Jesus.  A kitty cat.  There he is.  There's a picture of the kitty cat. 
[00:08:30]  So now I had to figure out how this trap works and open it up, and the kitty was hissing and all pissed off.  Was he scared, do you think?  Oh, he was petrified.  Poor little guy.  So I opened it up, and he darted out and left, and then I reset it.  Have you ever seen that cat before, though?  No.  Is it your neighbor's cat?  I don't know where it came from.  Fuck, dude.  Animals are just taking over your backyard when you're not around.  It's suburbia.  When you're not around.  They're everywhere.  I swear I'm going to get a pellet gun.  Little fuckers. 
[00:09:00]  But then I said it.  So this morning when I leave, I check the trap.  It's open.  The food's there.  The raccoon didn't go in.  No.  The dumb cat's going to be in there, I bet, when I get back home.  Of course.  Raccoons, I hear, are really, really smart.  They're very clever is what it is.  They're clever.  They get into anything.  No matter what kind of garbage pill you have, they get in it.  And my garbage is usually spilled all over the side of the house.  You're going to have to throw your house away.  You know that.  No.  If you fucking threw a couch away because of a lousy little booger from a little kid, 
[00:09:30]  I think you might have to throw the entire house away now.  Well, it's not that bad.  It's being worked on.  It's being fixed.  It's being cleaned.  Everything's being done.  I just, I got to get rid of these.  So I told people I had raccoons in my house.  Raccoons.  Raccoons?  Yeah, I used an apostrophe.  Raccoons.  And, of course, they made all types of inappropriate jokes on Twitter about that.  Did that make you happy?  Yes, it kind of did. 
[00:10:00]  Let's be honest with each other.  That made you really happy, didn't it?  But I said, I go, look, all right, let the obvious jokes begin.  To try to weed out the more obvious ones.  But some people came up with some clever little jokes.  I was surprised.  But, yeah, that was great, having the exterminator over.  And the only reason they found that is because the A.C. guys were up there fixing my bedroom air conditioner.  And they discovered all this? 
[00:10:30]  And, yeah, they said, you've got a raccoon problem.  I'm like, exterminator, call him.  Wait, yeah, you were saying you had an A.C. problem yesterday.  I don't know if you said that on the air.  So maybe the raccoons caused that.  No, that was caused by a blocked coil.  Just a coincidence?  Yeah, it froze up.  You sure it wasn't the raccoons just peeing on everything?  Just pissing on my air conditioning unit?  No, I think I would have smelt that coming out of the unit.  It was a frozen coil, and the fan was blowing and had nowhere to send the air.  So the fan got overheated and burnt out because I kind of smelled something burning. 
[00:11:00]  Let's go to Bob on Long Island.  Bobby.  Hey there, Bab.  You got something on this for Anthony?  Yeah.  Well, anybody that, any exterminator that comes to your house without a ladder on the truck  is not a true nuisance wildlife guy that's going to do this job right.  He did have a ladder.  He didn't have a tall enough ladder.  Didn't have a tall, well, with the compound, I doubt he would.  It's very tall. 
[00:11:30]  I have a, I like the high ground.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, that attic needs to have the raccoons exterminated.  And if he told you they're not in there during the day, he's wrong because that's what they  do during the day.  They stay in the attics.  Yeah, that's what, well, maybe they're not, maybe they're not in my attic during the day.  But that's what's confusing.  I mean, most raccoons, you know, hang tight during the day.  I've been up there during the day in that attic and nary saw anything. 
[00:12:00]  And you have an empty attic, right?  Yeah, it's just the AC units.  Is there any, like, holes or any other fucking little things in the attic they could be going  into?  Radio females?  Huh?  Bad radio females?  Oh.  No?  See them out there.  Oh, the little raccoon, leave him alone.  Hey, there's a hole up here.  Now, the, uh, I didn't see anything.  No holes, no nothing.  So they're just not there.  I don't know how the fuck they're getting in at this point, but, uh. 
[00:12:30]  Well, if, uh, if you don't, you know, if you don't get them, he doesn't get them, um,  I can leave my number, you know, when I get off the line and, uh, we can get over there  and do this.  Let's say hi to Larry and Yonkers.  He's trying to cock block my exterminator.  Larry!  Larry!  What's going on, guys?  What's up, Larry?  I had a serious problem with raccoons this time last year, and here's how you do it, guys.  The first thing is the bait and trap.  In fact, raccoons' very favorite bait is marshmallows.  Yeah.  Skunks won't touch marshmallows.  Possibles won't touch marshmallows. 
[00:13:00]  You narrow down your kill to your raccoon.  Well, there are marshmallows in my trap.  Oh, so you knew that already.  Here's what you gotta do.  You gotta get a 55-gallon drum, fill the water, put it in the backyard, have a heart trap,  catch the raccoon, drop them in the drum for five minutes, you drown them, you put them  in a garbage bag, and you throw them in a local dumpster.  Nobody answers, no questions, no smell, no tell.  You're a fucking serial killer.  He does this with hookers.  No kidding.  That's how it begins.  They got rabies, and they're in your attic, you sit there at a heart trap. 
[00:13:30]  Scabies?  You go, yeah, you go at nighttime, drop them in the bucket, five minutes, the bubbles come  up, and they're smart little fuckers.  They know you're gonna drown them.  Dude, even when I had to kill them.  They know you're gonna drown them.  They know you're gonna drown them.  Even when I had to kill mice with the electric trap, I was really bothered by that every  morning.  Let me tell you something.  I can't kill things.  Let me tell you something, my friend.  I don't have it in me to look at a raccoon in his little masked face and dunk him in 
[00:14:00]  water to drown him.  For five minutes.  I really, I come off like an insufferable prick, but I could never do that.  Yeah, the raccoons are always the cute ones in those animated cartoons, you know?  No, you can't.  These liberal bastards won't do it.  It's not about being liberal.  It's about being a fucking human being.  A lot of people can't just fucking drown a raccoon.  This guy might be right, though.  I have the rest of your solution for you.  Want to keep him away?  You get a dead one, you dismember the body, you leave body parts around the compound, see  that, they will not come back. 
[00:14:30]  I love this guy.  Hey, guy, I had little kids.  I don't want to wrap raccoons around a little kid.  Geez, Uncle Paul.  All right, I understand.  What do you do if they misbehave, Drown?  I'm going to fucking drum.  Okay, man.  I understand that's how you took care of him, sir.  But what I'm trying to say is the average person, I don't think, could do what you just described.  But Anthony's not the average person.  He's a very unique person.  No, I don't think Anthony could fucking drown animals.  I could never do that.  He could do a lot of weird shit, but he's not that guy that will go out there and drown animals. 
[00:15:00]  I'm a school teacher, and I love kids, and I love animals.  Do you?  But raccoons are a hazard around the house.  Revolving Mug wants to know if this is Colonel Kurtz on the phone.  I do want to know what the exterminator's going to do when they catch the raccoons in the trap, though, because you said it's a...  Where, though?  Where do they let the raccoons go?  It's Long Island.  In the country.  There's no country on Long Island.  The guy's going to drive them upstate.  I don't know what they do with them.  No, you have to dismember one and leave it around the compound.  We heard you, Larry.  Very disturbing for six fucking 20 in the morning. 
[00:15:30]  No one's going to do that, Larry.  No.  No one's going to do that.  No one is cutting up a raccoon and leaving body parts strewn about the yard.  And he's got little kids.  A pile of baby raccoon arms.  A little pile.  If I had one division of men like that, a raccoon problem would be over here very quickly.  That's how the raccoon laughs.  Doesn't the body parts horrify the kids when they're walking around your house?  No, we don't do that here because we're in Westchester.  It's too small an area. 
[00:16:00]  But that's what they do in Dutchess County.  Put a raccoon head on a pike in front of the house.  A tail, a foot, something like that.  They know.  They're very smart.  They recognize those body parts.  Larry, what do you do for a living?  I'm a school teacher.  You did say that.  I'm sorry.  I don't blame you then.  You have to deal with those little fuckers every day.  You probably have to get a little of that anger out at home.  Have you ever cut off a little raccoon foot, Larry?  No, no.  I'm an automotive teacher.  I have kids that want to be there. 
[00:16:30]  All right, Larry.  It was a dumb little joke.  All right, if we relax.  Larry's a weirdo.  Larry's wound very tight.  You're a weirdo.  It wasn't supposed to bring down the house.  It was just supposed to be a quick little chuckle.  Get a hold of yourself.  Yeah, you really are panicking, Larry.  All right, Larry.  Anything else?  That's it, guys.  Have a great day.  All right.  Larry from Yonkers.  That's a fine phone call, though.  Larry's a creep.  That's a fine phone call.  I bet right now Larry has a raging heart on it.  She's thinking of those little fucking raccoon body parts all over.  Dicing up raccoons. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, raccoon feet.  Let's go to Stryker.  Stryker.  Maybe he can help.  Hey, Anthony.  I'm just hoping that you don't catch Opie in that trap with the marshmallow.  Oh, now.  Like he'd try to pick him up with his hiney.  All right.  I did pick up marshmallows with my hiney.  What homosexual activity have you done, Stryker?  None.  Well, I mean, you had to have done something like picking up marshmallows with your ass. 
[00:17:30]  No, I haven't.  Nothing, huh?  Nothing.  I can honestly say that, yeah, that's a one-way route.  Oh, I see jokes being made about Larry here.  Yeah.  It rubs the lotion on its pelt.  It does this whenever it's told.  Larry wants to drown raccoons.  That's funny.  Put the fuck a raccoon in the 55-gallon drone.  Hey, you, Stryker.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  Hey, Anthony.  You know, raccoons like alcohol, too.  You know, maybe you have to keep them around. 
[00:18:00]  They could party with you.  Oh, shit.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe they're getting in my tap.  That's funny where they're at during the day.  Better check on your outflow there of...  Oh, my God.  All right.  Thank you, Stryker.  Jesus.  Steve in South Carolina.  Steve.  Oh, God.  Yo.  Tell them about the raccoon, Larry.  See, everyone's very excited that you have raccoons, Anthony.  Yes, they're very excited.  They all want to help on the phone.  What did you say?  They love using the coon line.  Yes, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  They love saying, I have a coon problem.  Because raccoons, especially down south, they just call it going coon hunting or something  like that.  And they made a lot of jokes.  A lot of inappropriate jokes on the Twitter.  On the Twitter.  Why'd you call them a mask face?  Because they're little eyes?  Yeah, they have a little mask.  Oh.  They wear a little mask.  They're like little bandits.  And their little hands work like hands.  They open up little things and they pick it up and they eat.  Oh, they're adorable if they're not in my house.  If I come in the house, though, and am confronted with a raccoon, I will have to have a person 
[00:19:00]  come over to seal up holes that will be in my floor and ceiling because I just will start  unloading on it with a firearm in my house.  I hope there's one actually pissing on the fucking trigger of your 50 cal.  Here, there's a picture of a raccoon fucking the family dog.  The family dog.  Are you kidding me?  They will do this.  I didn't know that.  They're that aggressive?  They'll go after your family pets. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  How humiliating for the dog.  That is, really.  Poor little beagle.  He's supposed to protect the house.  He's getting fucked by the raccoon.  He's just taking it in the ass.  That one with his teeth, baring his teeth.  Wow.  Fuck.  Would you drown a possum, though?  A possum.  The possum isn't as cute.  No, they don't wear little masks.  They got that weird mouth that's like, and their teeth.  That thing's always, like, splattered in the road, and their mouth is always just all 
[00:20:00]  busted up.  Yeah, look at that.  That's a possum?  Yeah, that's a possum.  Yeah, that possum is fucking...  Do they bite?  Oh, yeah.  What do you think?  Look at those fucking teeth.  What do you think they do with those?  If you come across a possum that's, like, being tailed by...  Wipe it off.  All animals bite.  You see little possums following them?  You stay the fuck away, because they really are defensive of their little children.  They'll turn around and...  They hiss. 
[00:20:30]  They make a weird...  Hissing sound, possums.  They're very frightening.  Do they charge you, or they just...  They will, if you get too close to their little children.  I think all animals charge.  Did you guys see the video?  Unfortunately, the lady had to run for her life, so it didn't...  It's not the greatest video.  I think it's on break.com, the buffalo, at Yellowstone Park.  Really?  Huh?  Yeah.  Charged.  Well, they see a nice...  They're in Yellowstone fucking park, and all of a sudden, they see a buffalo just walking 
[00:21:00]  across the parking lot, all nice, just minding its own business.  And typical tourist, they had to get a closer look.  Of course they do.  And I think the husband wanted to be a tough guy, and he started kind of jogging toward  the damn thing.  And all of a sudden, it made a noise, turned, and said, fuck you.  And, wow, we can't find it, unfortunately.  Charged at him.  And charged at him.  And then...  Take away his credit card or something.  And then you hear the lady...  Oh, there it is.  Look at this. 
[00:21:30]  It's on break.  It's a few pages.  A bison?  If you want a bison, sorry.  A bison?  Did I say buffalo?  Yeah, I don't know.  They're the same thing.  Okay, so we're in the park.  Watch this.  And there's a buffalo.  In a parking lot.  And he's just wandering across the road, taking his sweet time.  He's big.  Yeah, this is a giant.  Just chilling.  Like the old days, shoot him out of trains.  I'll call it to it.  No, you won't.  I got him on video. 
[00:22:00]  Zoom, Zoom.  I did.  What's the dummy going to do?  There's Donald.  Running for the buffalo.  Oh, the fat.  Look at this fat tourist.  This will make Jimmy very happy.  His little shorts.  There's our phone thing.  This will make Jimmy very happy.  The buffalo is off the fucking parking lot in the woods already.  Not bothering anyone.  But this dummy has to get a closer look.  Donald getting gored by the buffalo.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Look at the look.  Oh, shit.  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.  He starts bucking and then said, fuck you, and starts running right toward him.  Oh.  Someone's beeping their horn to try to help them.  Are you kidding?  Oh, the whoop is getting it.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  I can hear him.  She got trampled.  And I just knew.  It doesn't sound like I'm being trampled.  You know, I just thought that was my last moment.  I thought, this is going to be my last moment.  It's going to be in Yellowstone Park getting tromped by a buffalo. 
[00:23:00]  They say stay 100 feet away.  We were about 30, 35 feet.  I zoomed in on him.  But that wasn't far enough because they're fast.  And they can turn on their dime.  She's all fucked up.  She's all fucked up showing her really bruised thighs.  I'm not saying I wouldn't go look at it, but I wouldn't walk towards it.  But the buffalo jumped up and down on its feet.  Yeah, yeah, it was bucking up and down and turned around, and a second was after them.  I didn't think a buffalo could move like that.  They're giant.  What I love about it was the cocky guy. 
[00:23:30]  Everyone wants to get a little closer look.  We've all kind of started walking toward wildlife, absolutely.  I do that when I see deer and shit.  It's so dumb to do.  But he marched all cocky, like, watch how close I get.  I got him.  But did the buffalo bite her or just run over?  What did he do?  They just trample.  They'll stomp you and take their big, giant forehead and bash you with it.  Yeah, they do like that.  They try to gore you. 
[00:24:00]  Makes you happy, Jimmy?  Yeah, because it was so stupid.  It was already...  It was just...  You stay in the car and look at it, then drive away or back into it.  Plus, in the parking lot, they had a great view.  They got great video.  Yeah.  They were easily, like, what, 60, 70 feet away from it.  They had to chase him into the fucking brush, wooded area.  It didn't kill her, though.  And, uh, no.  Bruised her up pretty good.  It was good.  Stomped all over a big, fat, dumb tourist legs.  Dumb husband just left her there?  Get back in the car! 
[00:24:30]  Get back in the car!  Oh, this is a good point.  Let's go to Ken and Augusta.  Ken.  Hey, what up, boys?  What up, brother?  Hey, you know, I'm starting to think, with all these animals coming around, maybe we should  rename the compound the Ark and just start calling Anthony and Noah.  Ah.  How many animals you got coming around?  Two by two.  You got the raccoons.  You got cats, obviously.  Raccoons and cats.  What else have you seen?  He's got mice.  He's got it all.  You think you got mice?  No, I got a lot of bees.  Yeah, see?  I got bees. 
[00:25:00]  Bees.  Because I got a lot of flowers.  I got flowers.  Yeah, we got the Noah joke, Ken.  Thank you.  I didn't even know what you said.  No, he's doing...  Ken, what'd you say?  Oh, Jimmy was reading.  Ken, go ahead.  I just think we ought to...  I heard you!  I'm an asshole.  Both of you.  Let's go to Chris in Detroit.  Chris.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, it's, um, yeah.  It's warm in the tea.  Hey, watch the right side of the video. 
[00:25:30]  The, uh, the guy throws something at him.  He entassed him.  Oh, is that true?  Yeah, if you watch it, it's like a white piece of board or something.  Yeah, before the, uh, buffalo freaks out?  Yeah, right before he freaks out, you can see it kind of flying, hit him in the ass end.  Oh, a lot of people say that.  A guy threw a stick at the buffalo, one of the TV stations, highlight the stick since  you can't see it on the regular video.  Ah.  Yeah.  This fucking guy threw a stick?  So the guy throws a stick.  Can you see this? 
[00:26:00]  Let's see.  There's the buffalo.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, what a motherfucker!  Ah, you asshole.  You can see it hit the buffalo's back.  Show that to Jimmy again.  Oh, is this the guy who's...  What?  See that?  He threw a stick at it?  Yeah, he threw a stick at it.  It hits it right in the middle of his, uh, the side of the buffalo.  That's what annoyed him.  Why would you throw a stick at it?  Because fucking humans in general are assholes.  Oh, good.  Leave the fucking thing alone.  So that makes sense.  Why the fuck would you throw shit at him?  See that?  What a jerk-off. 
[00:26:30]  And the thing just really got angry.  That's why it said, fuck you, and turned around.  It was minding its business.  And the guy had to throw a stick at it.  Minding its own beeswax.  I think I threw a fucking stick at it.  Oh, did he piss that thing off?  Wow.  What does he think?  Like, people think animals are too stupid.  It's like, he won't know where the stick came from.  No, he knew exactly where it came from.  No, they're fully aware.  You dumb motherfucker.  That buffalo was just jumping for joy at the idea of pouncing his fucking head.  I really was. 
[00:27:00]  Jumping for joy.  Buffaloes look stupid before they charge.  They really do.  They're just big.  You can almost hear them going, ba-hoop, ba-hoop.  They're just running.  Idiots.  Look how muscular they are, though.  They're strong.  Jesus.  Oh, crazy strong.  I think so.  Crazy strong.  I think they can bench press a lot.  They got a fine upper body.  I hate this fat tourist.  You ever see one at the gym?  It's amazing.  Yeah.  This big, fat tourist.  Why do they throw a stick at it?  I throw something at the buffalo to get his attention. 
[00:27:30]  I love when you go to a zoo, and if the animals are sleeping, you get to see a lot of people  throw little pebbles and rocks at the animals, because they need the animals awake.  Hey, you paid good money to get in there.  Wake the fuck up.  Let's go to Rob in New Hampshire.  Rob.  Hey there, Rob.  I went out to Sturgis a few years back, and we rode out to Yellowstone, and I had my  buddy take a picture.  I got about 15 feet from a buffalo, turned around, and he snapped the picture.  The thing looked up, bucked it up and down like a wild horse, then ran across the street, 
[00:28:00]  dropped down, and rolled around on its back like a dog.  Scared the shit out of me.  Why would it do that?  I don't know.  It's stupid.  Yes, stupid.  I just wanted to get a picture in there, one.  It's just stupid.  Did you pet the buffalo?  No, I didn't pet the buffalo.  I understand trying to get a little closer to get a nice shot.  Yeah, look at it.  I got about 15 feet, and it was a little too close.  But this asshole had to throw a stick at it.  Has he explained why he threw a stick at it? 
[00:28:30]  It looks like a tampon he threw at it.  Look at it.  It looks like a baton or something, right?  Yeah, a little board, a little piece of two by four or something.  Yeah, those things get pretty mean.  If you look online, I was watching a show once, one of those stupid TV reality shows,  and the buffalo actually threw a person nearly 20 feet up into a tree.  Oh, shit.  Oh, this guy knows why.  Thank you, sir.  This guy knows why he threw the stick.  Mike in Wisconsin.  Mike.  Mike.  Hey, guys. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, remember the old gag where you take your wife on a lovely cruise ship,  and then she accidentally gets thrown off the back of the cruise ship?  Oh, this loser, he couldn't afford a cruise, and he couldn't find a secluded cliff,  so he was begging that fucking buffalo to tromple his wife.  If they had a real sensitive microphone, they probably could have heard him mumbling to himself.  He'd kill my wife.  Yeah.  Go get her.  Get this bitch.  Can you imagine?  I like that.  I like that theory.  Get this glum cunt. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Well, why don't we go to Greg in D.C.?  Greg.  Greg.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I actually got two of them.  One Opie probably heard of when he was up in Buffalo.  The best one, though, is when you type in alligator fail on YouTube,  you get to see dummies who supposedly train alligators,  shove their entire arms inside an alligator.  Oh, yeah.  Seen that one.  Yeah.  Well, there's a whole bunch of them.  A whole bunch of trainers getting bit. 
[00:30:00]  Where the guy gets his arm pretty much twisted off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Goes into a death row.  But when you were up in Buffalo, I've got family up there.  We used to go to Canada every year.  And did you ever hear about the people who go to the dumpsters at night in the summertime?  Oh, for the bears?  Yes.  Yeah.  What?  I've seen that one.  You never heard about that, Opie?  I really haven't.  Talk me through it.  Oh, no.  These dummies will go to dumpsters in the middle of the summer.  There are just families in their cars and will sit in front of dumpsters or big, just lots 
[00:30:30]  of, like, landfills.  And bears will come and start eating.  And these people will turn on their lights and they'll put food on top of their car.  Yeah.  They're hoping to entice a bear to come to their car.  Anyone have video of this?  And when the bear comes to the car, they stand up on their hind legs and start pushing in  the windows.  Wow.  Yep.  Like, boom, boom, really, really strong.  I've got to be honest. 
[00:31:00]  I think I would do that.  You would do that?  Yeah.  I think I would do that.  I wouldn't do that without a weeping.  You know, I'm not perfect.  I think I would do that.  I would fucking drive up to a dumpster and watch the bears.  I don't know if I would put the food on my car.  That sounds completely crazy.  Yeah.  It's the dummies who put sandwiches and candy bars and things on top of their car.  You've heard of the sand?  Oh, yeah.  I've seen a thing of it on the television.  He saw it on the television.  And then the last thing is, uh...  Well, Jimmy and Voss used to watch the rats when they were coming home from the comedy 
[00:31:30]  clubs.  Yeah, that's creepy.  We would put peanut butter Reese's Cups on the ground.  On Voss's balls.  Yes.  And then I would lick them off with a rat hat on.  I just had a hat with two little ears on it.  And we would park up in the 70s, where it's now the subway station.  Yep.  And we would watch the rats.  We would just put, there were like 10 or 15 of them on the garbage.  So many of them would come out of those little areas.  Those little median strips.  They're all over in New York.  The median strips in New York City, where you have like the grass and like the foliage. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, it's overgrown.  Always rats in that.  Because people are just throwing like food and shit.  They're done eating.  And they can hide there.  It's a perfect place to just throw your shit.  You see it rattling around, like the grass is moving.  The weeds.  And it's rats.  Yep.  A bunch of rats.  I'd hate to have rats.  Oh, God.  They're giant, creepy.  Thank you, Greg and DC.  How big are possums?  No problem.  They're as big as rats, I think.  Possums are bigger than rats.  Aren't they bigger?  Are they bigger than rats?  Yeah, they're like small dogs.  A couple of feet long. 
[00:32:30]  Hmm.  We've got two-footer.  They kill little kittens and stuff, too.  With their nasty tails, too.  They've got that nasty, hairless fucking rat tail.  Oh, there's a good one.  There's a possum that was made good.  Oh, that tire went right over his midsection.  They're so fucking dumb.  Yeah.  They're constantly being run over.  You see a lot of dead possums.  What if anybody has them as pets?  Because they are mammals.  Aren't most mammals make pettable?  I don't know.  A possum is just...  A possum. 
[00:33:00]  First of all, it's ugly as sin.  And then secondly, I think they're just nasty.  I don't think they could really be trained.  I mean, if you have it from possum birth.  I think too many instincts to weed out, to domesticate them.  Like raccoons, too, are the same thing.  You know, they're cute.  People would like them, but they're just...  They're nasty animals.  Really creepy.  I think it'd be hard to have a koala bear as a pet.  Or a panda.  What an annoyance.  Just slowly.  A koala bear would slowly ruin your house.  They move all slow, but he'd slowly rip the arm off your couch. 
[00:33:30]  You'd be going, no, stop it.  Just chewing your table legs.  But real slow.  Are they slow?  Yeah, they're very slow.  Oh my God, they're fucking...  They just kind of move around their little eucalyptus trees.  It's like, hurry up already.  They never have coughs.  AJ in Utah.  AJ.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  Hello.  How are you?  I'm not a fan of the two things, by the way, when you call a radio show.  Exactly.  How about one, and then we'll vote. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, you choose one solid thing and fucking say it and get the hell out of it.  Go with it.  Okay.  All right, go with the two things.  Maybe I'm wrong.  A couple years ago, a family and I went up to Yellowstone, and there was a herd of about  30 to 40 buffalo crossing the road, and this jackass behind me started blowing his horn  to speed them up and make them cross the road faster.  And two of them turned, thought it was me, and charged at my car.  Ah, that guy fucked you good. 
[00:34:30]  Uh-oh.  Well, and, you know, I mean, a fucker's weight, you know, 1,000, 1,500 pounds, and the one,  it just, like, took about four steps and stopped.  The other one actually rammed the side of my car, took out a fender and my mirror and  my one window.  It's like being hit by a car.  It's like demolition derby.  Pretty much.  And, you know, raccoons will kill a dog.  We had one kill my neighbor's dog.  It actually smothered the dog.  And this was like a big German shepherd. 
[00:35:00]  Smothered it?  What did it do?  How did it do that?  It actually, using its claws, the two had gotten into a fight, the raccoon was able to get  the dog to the ground and actually wrapped its claws around the dog's muzzle.  Wow, that's fucking, like, murderous.  That's prison shit.  No kidding.  That's raccoon prison shit.  He cracked a little gas balloon over the dog's head and burned him.  Jesus.  All right, man.  Whitey in Illinois. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, Whitey.  We're learning about nature today to start the show.  What do you got, Whitey?  Good morning.  When I was a kid, I lived across the road from a farmer who had cattle.  And me and my friend, when I was about 10 years old, a friend of mine and I walked over  because he had a dead cow in the yard.  It was kind of wintertime.  It was a little chilly.  And you know how kids are.  We started poking this fucking cow with a stick and it starts moving.  And come to find out, there was a possum inside it. 
[00:36:00]  Possums are scavengers.  They would crawl inside of this cow because it was partially warm.  What part of the cow?  The asshole?  Yeah, they crawl inside the asshole and they eat their way around the inside of the cow.  That's pretty fucking sick.  You really want one of those for a pet to me?  I hate to kiss a possum after he was eating a cow asshole.  Cow ass.  Cow bong.  There's your pet possum.  I guarantee you somebody somewhere feeds them in the country.  Oh, I'm sure.  And has a bunch of them and raccoons.  And I guarantee you there's at least, there's somebody who has some kind of relationship with 
[00:36:30]  these shitty animals.  Any animals, especially, unless they're like fucking Komodo dragons, a mammal especially  recognizes, I think, who's feeding it.  Yeah.  Unless it's a lion who's going to attack you.  But eventually it gets hungry and you don't know that, so it starts eating you.  Well, that's what I'm saying, unless it's a lion or a panther.  You've got to really figure out its eating schedule or guess what, you're going to be in deep  trouble.  But if they're small, I'm like a possum.  I mean, possums can't kill you and neither can a raccoon. 
[00:37:00]  It would be really annoying if it starts gnawing at you, though.  But they are very rabid these days.  Yeah, raccoons, especially out on Long Island, they've had a lot of cases of rabid raccoons.  The one I saw walking around my house didn't look a little crazy or rabid or anything, but...  But it was daytime.  Yeah.  Now, which is cool, I could look at my security cameras and look at the trap, so I'll keep  everybody updated.  When you catch another cat.  Yeah, when I see a cat go in there. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe one more here.  This guy...  Yeah, one more.  Actually, this is what Jimmy was just saying about how...  I mean.  You know, if you're the guy feeding the animals, can you domesticate them, right?  Or at least, if you have a barn or whatever, not be bitten by them or interact with them  on some level where they recognize you.  Spike the Trucker.  Spike, you got one?  Yeah.  A buddy of mine, he raised the buffalo that you see in the movie Radio Flyer, and also 
[00:38:00]  he was in a commercial.  I think it was like an insurance commercial or some shit.  But the way he got this buffalo to move around at will was he'd hand-feed them Oreos ever  since he was a pup.  And it got to the point where you would just crinkle that plastic Oreo package, and this  buffalo would come running from across the fucking yard at full gallop right towards  you and stop right in front of you, and you'd give him an Oreo.  Aw, that's kind of cute. 
[00:38:30]  That is adorable.  So wait, so he would hold his hand out flat, and the buffalo would just stupidly eat an  Oreo out of it?  Oh, yeah.  It was just like a dog.  The thing would just come running up to you at a full fucking gallop, and then just stop  right in front of you waiting for his Oreo.  Aw, how cute?  How big was it?  I think it got up to like 2,500 pounds.  Oh, shit, that's a car.  Would the buffalo let you pet it?  Would he let you pet him?  Yeah, he'd just stand there and look at you, you know, big brown eyes, just, you know. 
[00:39:00]  Huge fucking horns.  He would, uh, he had these, uh, tires, these big old diesel truck tires laying out in his  corral, and, uh, he would hook them with his horn and just pulling them up in the air.  This thing's way over 100 pounds.  Yeah.  And these things would just go sailing through the fucking sky.  People don't understand how strong those fucking things are.  But if you crinkled the Oreo package, he would come over, would he be aggressive for  the food or just wait for you to hold it out?  No, it was a really unnerving sight.  Um, you know, I, I didn't do it, but I would watch him do it. 
[00:39:30]  Is there any video of this?  Yeah, really?  Um, I don't know.  I'd have to call him up.  He's up in Alaska.  Oh, all right.  I'd have to see.  I don't think the buffalo's still alive anymore.  Heh heh.  I think somebody...  He probably shot at me.  He gained his trust and they made Bison burgers.  He hit him over the head with a hammer and crinkled that plastic.  And there's a, there's a, I don't know if you know this, but buffalo are the only creatures 
[00:40:00]  that grizzly bear are afraid of.  I actually...  Buffalo are the gnarliest fucking animals on the planet, well, on the North American...  Why would a bear be afraid of a buffalo?  The fucking things are huge, man.  They're just giant.  Well, bears are fucking ridiculous.  The power that those bison have, though, to just wail their head into you, it's like  getting hit by a cannonball.  Yeah, man.  One of those fucking big horns would gore a grizzly bear nicely.  But bears could fucking use their arms.  Yeah.  Yeah, but use their arms against what? 
[00:40:30]  Look at the fucking front half of that thing.  That fur, you can't get through that.  Even a bear would have a problem getting through that fucking shit.  But don't lions eat buffalo on the range?  They love buffalo, but they get them from the side, a bunch of them.  Yeah.  No.  I don't think they're taking down a full-grown buffalo.  Wait, what are they...  There's like water buffalo that they take down in Africa.  Isn't that bad?  No, those are like the American buffalo, which are a little different.  Oh.  What do buffalo have those weird...  It looks like they got that weird hairdo where they got that... 
[00:41:00]  The little fucking Chrissy from Three's Company hairdo?  Well, the amazing buffalo video, which has one copy of it, has 54 million views.  One copy has 8 million views.  You've seen this video?  Which one?  With the buffalo in Africa?  Oh, look at this shit.  Oh, they take it down.  See, that's a smaller...  It doesn't have as much protection around its...  Oh, look at these fucking...  Jesus.  Around its front.  Yeah.  She's taking them out.  Those...  There's like three females on top of this fucking water buffalo. 
[00:41:30]  One's got it by the nose.  One by the neck.  Another one by the scruff of its neck.  And they're already eating it.  And they're just...  Whoa!  And the buffalo's...  Oh, it just fucking, like, gored one of the lions.  Picked him up by the horn.  But they got his neck.  The lion is holding its neck.  Yeah, yeah.  That lion kind of backed off.  And there's two more trying to just...  They just try to eat it and hope it stands still.  And he's bucking lions off it.  Yeah, that lion got fucked up.  And now the buffalo is down.  And now there are four lions eating the shit out of this buffalo. 
[00:42:00]  It's still alive, and they just...  Yeah, that lion got fucked up.  That one's walking away all fucked up.  Those lions win.  There's fucking...  When four lionesses...  Oh, that one got gored.  Gordon the fucking...  One lion's got gored, but they did kill the buffalo.  Damn.  Hey, Spike, thanks for the phone call.  If it takes four fucking lions to bring that thing down.  Unbelievable.  It's amazing.  All right.  We got a girl that had a...  Discovery Channel.  Had a pet raccoon.  Oh, let's talk to her.  You want to talk about her?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  All right, let me say hi.  Can you put a peanut butter on your clit?  Actually, it's Don in Nevada.  Don?  A marshmallow up your pussy.  Hey, buddy.  Oh, that's a guy.  I know.  Just let it sit there with his little tongue.  A lot of people had pet raccoons.  They're stupid.  Holy shit, we got six fucking pet raccoon stories.  Don, you're representing everyone.  We can't take six pet raccoon stories.  Is this Don on the phone?  I'll take the ball.  Yeah, I was up in Wyoming, a little town. 
[00:43:00]  The girl had a pet raccoon on a little collar and a leash walking around in the park.  And I went up and talked to her.  And she'd pick it up by the scruff of the neck and point a finger at it and say, bad.  And he'd put his little raccoon hands over his eyes and hide.  Aw.  They're just adorable.  That's adorable right there.  I've got to tell you.  Just adorable.  So they're trainable, I guess, like most mammals.  Yeah.  The mother had gotten run over by a car.  It was in the spring.  So she went looking around in the ditch and found two little babies. 
[00:43:30]  And one of them died.  And the other one...  Oh, boy.  She kept for a pet.  There you go.  It was really cool.  Maybe if you raise them for one of their little babies.  But they still got that instinct in them.  And they're very wild.  But they don't know you're not a raccoon.  They're dumb.  Like, dogs think you're a dog, those assholes.  Is that true?  Yeah, they think that you're a more powerful dog.  You're the alpha dog.  Yeah.  That's why they listen to you.  That's why the dog whisperer always tells you to, you know, act like the alpha dog when  your dog is acting up.  And they'll just fucking calm their shit down because they're like, all right, you're the 
[00:44:00]  boss.  You showed me.  They don't know.  They don't know that we're terrified of them.  Yeah.  They just know that they're stupid.  We make them guard our used car lots.  Our junkyards.  They watch shit for us.  Watch this.  I'm going away.  Stand here and don't shit on the rug.  All right, so Ant has a raccoon problem.  We're going to take a break into some other things.  We got Steven Adler stopping in today.  I was looking through his book.  It's called My Appetite for Destruction. 
[00:44:30]  Where did he come up with that title?  I don't know.  Very coincidentally, also kind of the album title.  I didn't know he was only with GNR for five years, though.  Yeah.  From 85 to 90.  90, and then they kicked him out.  Yeah, then, I mean, GNR.  Those are some big fucking years.  How many more years did GNR really do after that?  Those are the big years.  85 to 90, yeah.  And then what?  GNR was pretty much done in 94?  Four?  I was going to say five, maybe.  Maybe.  So, I don't know.  Who played drums after him? 
[00:45:00]  Uh, oh, the dude.  He was bald.  Oh, the fuck.  From, um...  Yeah, something that sounded like...  Oh, help me out.  Who played drums after Adler left?  I'm waiting.  Kenny.  He was from the band...  Oh.  Matt Sorum.  Wasn't he from the cult?  It was Matt Sorum.  Oh, Matt Sorum.  What do you see him doing?  But Adler was pretty much...  I mean, User Illusion came out in 91, so...  And that was pretty much it for after they toured, you know? 
[00:45:30]  Was Adler on that album?  Uh, no.  Adler was given the opportunity to be on that album, I believe, if he cleaned up his act.  Oh.  And he never did.  I think, if I remember right, he recorded, like, one song for that album, and then they  just kicked him out.  You know how ridiculous that is?  That he had such a problem that they told him to clean up his act, as the rest of the  band were doing their shit?  It's just fucked up.  Their shit?  Yeah, that is something.  What band was he in before?  Guns N' Roses.  It's driving me nuts. 
[00:46:00]  Who, Adler?  No, the other dude.  Was it?  Former cult drummer?  It was, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  The cult.  All right, we'll take a break.  Continue.  We want to hear what's inside your little brain.  Call 866-866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM. 
[00:46:30]  Busy day in New York today.  Obama's in town.  He's taping today for The View.  Oh, great.  Today.  He taped today for tomorrow, I guess.  It's by our house.  I know it is.  And I saw all the, yesterday, all the things were set up.  Yeah.  It was going to be hard to drive.  Great.  I wonder if we'll have problems driving over there later.  Ah, we'll figure it out.  Must be a pain in the ass to be the president. 
[00:47:00]  You can't do shit without them closing off everything.  Must be great.  When did that start, you think?  It was happening with Kennedy.  November of 62, I think it was.  You think it got way worse after that, obviously?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Why didn't they do it live?  I thought that show was live.  What's the matter?  Is that the conspiracy thing?  They don't want Obama going on there live?  Might trip up?  What do they need?  Everything, you know, squeaky clean and edited and shit? 
[00:47:30]  Is that it?  Oh, come on.  Come on.  There's a live audience.  Yeah.  And I'm sure there'll be press people there, so if he fucks up, they're going to pick up  on it.  Probably whenever his schedule will allow.  Schedule.  Schedule.  Schedule.  Why aren't they just showing it today, though?  Yeah, why not show it today, live?  I don't know.  Do it live.  That seems to me to be a little more exciting.  A little more spontaneous.  Maybe he was only going to be in New York a certain time today, so he would like to do 
[00:48:00]  the show, but he can't do it until this time.  Well, Hasselbeck hates Obama.  Let's see if she's got balls today.  She'll be a worm.  You think she'll just be a worm?  Because she says she...  Oh, whatever.  If you don't like Obama, that's fine.  But, I mean, don't be a phony.  You know, you have a chance to really, you know, attack him, whatever you want to call  it.  And she'll just sit there all nice.  I don't like her, because I think she's what a lot of them think.  Like, they couldn't get a smarter fucking broad, or a more tenacious broad than that cracked 
[00:48:30]  up idiot.  Broad.  Really, though.  Get a woman who's at least going to defend her point vehemently, and not be just a flustered  mess.  She's a flustered idiot.  If you want to have fun, watch Elizabeth Hasselbeck videos on YouTube.  She's had a lot of fucking problems on that show.  A lot of issues, man.  Busting down crying all the time.  All the fucking time.  Going after Kathy Griffin.  Getting all mad at Kathy Griffin.  Why?  I don't know. 
[00:49:00]  Because Kathy was giving her a little shit, and she started crying.  She's crying.  Is she me?  She's me as a kid.  Stop it.  I got a stomachache.  Who would be the best to talk to Obama on that show?  Because then you've got the other one that thinks the world is flat, so you've got to...  Oh, that dunce.  Barbara Walters is laying in a bed somewhere, making sure her heart's okay.  No, she's coming in for this.  Oh, she's coming in for this?  Of course she is.  So Barbara Walters can handle a president, obviously. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  And then Whoopi, I would assume, would be right in there.  Oh, I'm sure.  Whoopi's going to be all like, you know, sister, brother and sister kind of a thing,  I think.  And then Joy Behar will, you know, get a few lines in, a few jokes.  Throw in some jokes about the Republicans and the Tea Party thing, I think, just to,  you know, make him feel better about himself.  That's exactly what I would do.  They'll all laugh.  I'd be fucking Gary Grovel.  Gary Grovel.  Good point, sir.  Good point, good point.  Good point.  Very good, very good.  I agree, I agree, I agree.  You're fantastic. 
[00:50:00]  Here's a guy, Ron in Jersey.  Yeah, he's doing some time in Jersey today as well.  Ron?  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Hello.  Morning, Amy.  What?  Yeah, that scumbag is coming to Edison, New Jersey today, and it's four blocks from my  house, the little sandwich shop he's going to, so he's going to fuck up everything in  town and cost the town a boatload of fucking money we ain't got in the first place.  So he ought to take his ass and go back to fucking Washington where he belongs. 
[00:50:30]  Just so he can, what this amounts to is campaigning.  He's campaigning.  Just so he can have a goddamn sub-sandwich from a local place and promote his small business  loans, which are going to cost everybody ten times more money.  You know, this guy's a dick.  He ought to just...  Oh, he's promoting his small business tax?  Is that what he's promoting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How to kill the economy the rest of the fucking way.  Yeah.  Good luck.  I love the photo ops where they have to close down everything and then to make it look like, 
[00:51:00]  oh, Obama's just stopping in for a sandwich.  Yeah.  He just popped in.  It's all bullshit.  Yeah, he was driving outside and he said, I want a sandwich.  Yeah.  They don't tell you that they set it up a month ahead of time and then the whole fucking neighborhood  has to stop living until he gets his Sam...  I was ready to say Sambo.  His sandwich.  But I do say fucking Sambo for sandwich.  Not to mention that the intersection he's going to is one of the busiest in town.  Yeah.  So, yeah, he's just going to fuck up everything today. 
[00:51:30]  Like, well, nothing new.  He's been fucking it up for two years.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, shit.  I love when they just shut down, like, the LIE or something for a president just because  you've got to get him from the airport to Manhattan.  Yeah.  That is the biggest pain in the ass for everybody.  It's when a couple of cops pull out on the expressway and then just start slowing down  and kind of zigzagging and traffic behind him just comes to a dead stop.  Dead stop.  And you're like, all right, that's it.  And it's not for a mile. 
[00:52:00]  It's for the entire route back into Manhattan.  Yeah, for his whole route.  So, all right, sir.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike in Massachusetts.  Mike.  Hey, boys.  How you doing this morning?  All right, man.  I want to talk to you about your coon problem you got in the house there, Anthony.  It's raccoon, but okay, go ahead.  What are you going to do?  Do you think that coon is coming to town today?  If you could choke him out.  Oh, Jesus.  It's just...  I don't get the... 
[00:52:30]  That's the easy stuff.  It's not clever.  It's obvious.  I don't mind the clever racial humor.  The easy fucking...  Yeah.  What did the guy say?  I didn't hear him.  Yeah.  Maybe the coon that's going to be there today can help you.  He had no joke.  He just wanted to say the coon.  All right.  We get it.  God, dude.  Hey, man.  That's pretty cool for the view, though.  They get Obama.  It's a weird booking, though, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's the first president to do, what, daytime TV, I guess? 
[00:53:00]  Is it?  Something like that.  Obama was on there when he was campaigning.  Yeah, yeah.  They all do that when they campaign, and then they have to...  But he's campaigning again now for everybody in November, for all his little Democratic  friends in November who are just going to get their asses handed to him.  I'm actually so motivated to get out and vote and just get other people to do it.  I want to have a vote party.  Well, it's going to be a slam dunk for the Democrats losing or whatever.  I hope so. 
[00:53:30]  I meant to say.  It's going to be a slam dunk.  Bastards.  They're explaining the type of people that come out for these type of elections.  Yeah, yeah.  When it's not the big one.  Midterms are...  The big one, everyone comes out, meaning minorities and what's not...  And the youngsters that are all like...  The youngsters, the hipsters.  Full of piss and vinegar and think, things are going to change, man.  We're finally seeing the change that we were looking for.  It's not like the same old, old man, like my old man, man. 
[00:54:00]  The one that raised you and fucking gave you cars and everything else.  You spoiled little fuckers.  It's just another sign that we're getting old.  Like, you know, when you feel a little ear hair coming in, you're like, all right, I'm getting a little older.  But then the other thing is when you realize that nothing changes, man.  Nothing changes, man.  When you have to accept that, then you know you're getting up there in years.  We changed the world back in the 60s, man.  Did you?  We thought we were changing the world in the 70s and 80s, too. 
[00:54:30]  Grew up and became an insurance salesman.  Shut up, you hippie.  Yeah, but they wear their Jerry Garcia ties to work.  Yeah, yeah, man.  A little connection.  They're still living the dream.  Believe me, you're not changing anything.  Anything worse than an old hippie?  If you wanted something changed and it changed, it's coincidence.  It's just coinkydink that it happened at the same time.  Yeah.  Yeah, because in midterm elections, a lot of people, you know who come out? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, a lot of professional voters, they don't get the youngsters and motivate them.  They don't get the ethnics and motivate them.  It's, you know, what, not president?  Obama's still president, right?  Two more years, what?  Okay, I can wait.  That's what they do.  Right.  Hopefully the Republicans will take away some of this dummy's power.  Oh, we'll see.  We got some weird thing that happened. 
[00:55:30]  Santa Cain came in, what, yesterday?  Lovely girl.  A lovely girl.  We did a makeover with her and tried to turn her into a, like, a person.  A person.  I felt miserably.  Turned her into, like, a young Britney Spears.  Your pictures, wow, did they get rave reviews.  The pictures.  People just loved it.  Yeah, yeah.  And when you Twittered the pictures.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Britney.  Britney Spears.  She looked just like her.  She sure did.  And then I popped a video up on the YouTube channel, OP Radio. 
[00:56:00]  The YouTube.  It came out pretty good, I guess.  But, uh, Santa Cain left some horrible voicemails yesterday.  She's now angry.  Yeah.  Over a hat or something?  Yeah.  What happened?  Did you guys take her hat?  I know all sorts of crazy shit happens after we leave here.  I didn't.  What happened to her hat?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why are you laughing?  It's the first time hearing about the hat.  Well, I haven't seen the hat.  What'd you do to her hat?  I don't do anything to that.  Does she have her hat back?  No. 
[00:56:30]  When are you going to give it back to her?  I don't know where it is.  Why are you smiling?  I'm happy.  Why?  Why?  I'm just a happy guy.  Oh, boy.  I think starting at 11 o'clock, you push a lot of fucking little buttons around here.  Oh, yeah.  What do you know about Santa Cain's hat?  She's missing it.  She's basically leaving death threats and calling the police over us.  Yes, she did.  She left like three voicemails on Steve's phone because she realized she left them last  night.  She's in here on Monday. 
[00:57:00]  And then on Tuesday night, she realized she'd forgotten her hat.  And then she thought that since Steve hadn't called her back, somebody must have stolen  the hat.  So she called a few times.  Three times total.  And does anyone know where the hat is?  I don't.  Holy shit.  Where's her fucking hat?  I don't.  Daddy, my hat blew off.  Is it her cowgirl hat?  Your head had been in it.  I hope your goddamn head was in it.  Best line ever.  Goddamn head was in it. 
[00:57:30]  I hope your goddamn head was in it.  The hat!  I'm sure somebody knows where her hat is, but I don't.  Is it the cowboy hat that she needs for her dumb fucking Times Square thing?  She does say she needs it for work.  For work.  Why doesn't she stop?  Well, she left this message.  You know, Steve, it's Tuesday night.  I just came in.  You know, being Britney Spears and all that bullshit, I left my fucking hat up at the studio.  And it's Tuesday night. 
[00:58:00]  We did it Monday morning.  And I'm first realizing that I don't have my fucking hat.  Because, you know, it just, it really threw me.  I couldn't have...  That's her whole fucking world.  She needs her dumb hat.  It really threw me.  I wish off a building.  But she forgot her hat.  It wasn't like...  How did she forget her hat?  It should be removed in a vestibule.  That'd be great.  Elevated door opens.  Hat removal.  We're on Jersey Shore.  Because, you know, it just, it really threw me. 
[00:58:30]  I couldn't, of course, I couldn't do that Dutch interview.  They were all out there and I had to stand them up.  And my fucking hat, which I need to work, is gone.  And you probably, you stupid interns, you're Sam Roberts and you're Danny.  Oh, they're confusing.  Sam and Danny.  Stupid interns is what you are.  She showed you.  She might be crazy, but she's not stupid.  I don't think Sandy likes me because every time she comes in and, like, we make eye contact,  I just make the face like I smelled something bad. 
[00:59:00]  Stink eye her.  Stink eye.  Danny, do you know where her hat is?  I don't know where it is now.  Oh, no.  All right.  You're Sam Roberts and you're Danny probably stole it.  They had my stuff all over the floor.  I mean, my blue wig.  They had all my stuff fucking on the floor.  Disgusting.  And then they probably stole the hat.  Somebody could have called and said, you left your hat here. 
[00:59:30]  You know I need that to work, to make a living.  You know, and you guys have absolutely no feelings for me.  You're no better than the naked cowboy.  And you're worse.  You know, I did that with backwards for you.  I did that.  And I didn't make money on Monday.  You know, for your stupid makeup artist.  She got shit all in my eyes.  My eyes are burning all over.  Janine.  Janine catches some shit. 
[01:00:00]  Damn, Janine.  You're stupid.  She tried to be nice the whole time, too.  And she's still.  Your stupid makeup artist got shit in her eye.  The makeup looked great.  I didn't see no shit in her eye.  You should have driven fucking pencils into them.  Like I feel when I look at her.  I want to do the same.  Get it?  I did.  That's a good one.  I got to publicly apologize to Janine. 
[01:00:30]  I apologize on Twitter.  And I guess I got to tell the ONA Nation there that I'm a jerk.  You're a jerk.  I filmed a dumb video.  And I had Janine putting the makeup on Santa Cain.  And I saw this jerk in the office.  So in the video, I wrote some annotations, whatever they're called.  And I go, who is this jerk?  And then Sam Roberts pops his head in in the video.  And I go, hey, Sam.  It's all written on the video.  Hey, Sam, punch this jerk for me. 
[01:01:00]  And then Janine had to write me.  I go, well, he's kind of a really good friend of mine.  Oh.  He came with me.  Is he?  Oh.  I think you should put douchebag instead of jerk.  What do you get?  I sit in the office.  I felt, I didn't feel good about his house.  Stupid guests.  She's like, I don't know how to tell you this, but he's a really, really good friend of mine.  Really close.  Oh, boy.  He came up here and really helped out and stuff.  He's still a jerk. 
[01:01:30]  He's a jerk.  All right, good.  Jerk.  He sounds like a real jerk.  He really is a jerk.  All right, I don't apologize.  Especially, he probably is the one who stole Sandy Cain's hat.  Ah.  Jerk.  I didn't think.  And I didn't make money on Monday, you know, for you stupid makeup artist.  She got shit all in my eyes.  My eyes were burning all day.  She threw away my eyelashes.  I had to go today, buy new eyelashes.  And I don't have my fucking hat.  Now, how would you like it, Steve? 
[01:02:00]  If people treated you like you treat me, I don't have my fucking hat.  Now, I hope you have it up there, because I want to pick it up.  Now, it would be so good to call me tomorrow, not too early.  I'm going to try to go out to work.  Don't have my hat to work with.  Be considerate enough to give me a call and tell me when I can pick my hat up if Sam or Danny haven't stolen it. 
[01:02:30]  Thank you.  I don't like these accusations.  You know my number.  Wow.  Just flat out blaming you, Sam.  I know.  Me and Danny.  I don't know why Danny and me get such a bad wraparound here.  Fucking Sandy Gibson.  That call.  Yeah.  Fuck.  So then I guess, Steve, you never called her back?  Well, I just, these happened at like 10.30 last night, so I was already racked out for the night.  So, no, I have not called her back.  And you'll, Steve, you don't know what it's like to be in here and catch abuse like Sandy Cain does. 
[01:03:00]  No, I really don't.  Not at all.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  What do you got there?  It's just a new hat.  Danny and me went to the hat store yesterday.  It's just ours.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Naked cowgirl brand.  Can you put that hat on?  I kind of want to just.  Why do I have to put that on?  I think you should, Sam.  I just want to tweet a picture today, Sam.  It's all right.  Would you put that on at it?  It's actually not that bad. 
[01:03:30]  It's only touching like wig hair.  Wig hair.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, but it stays in a fucking lotion.  My hat.  I need my hat for work.  My hat.  You have the hat.  Danny took the hat.  Dude, you got to text her that picture.  Oh, yeah.  Text her that picture.  Someone has to text.  Too bad you can't take a picture with five penises on her hat.  Text her the picture.  Just coming on it.  Jerk off on it.  Like a circle jerk.  That'll be fun anyway.  Of course, Sandy's hat. 
[01:04:00]  I'm writing that you just stole her hat.  But I didn't.  Opie's eye.  Sam stole.  For the record.  Did she just forget it here?  Canes.  I don't know.  This is the first time seeing it in the hat.  Oh.  I wonder where.  Well, where did it just come from?  Danny's hands.  Danny?  Where?  Where are you?  You just put it.  I went back in the office and I was like, what's this?  Oh, it was in the office.  Just now?  I was like, let me bring it in studio because we're talking about this right now.  Oh.  And you just found it just now?  Yeah.  So she must have left it there. 
[01:04:30]  Good news, Sandy.  We found your hat.  We found your hat.  There's no need to panic and fucking start getting all nasty with everybody.  And the fact that you didn't get paid.  No one gets paid to come in here, by the way.  And you're getting publicity.  What do you think?  You're out there doing your naked cowgirl ripoff act.  Exactly.  Stolen act.  You're stolen fucking act.  Let's be honest here.  The guy's completely got a case.  And what do you think?  You're coming in here and getting publicity isn't helping you?  We played her song. 
[01:05:00]  It's not our problem that you can't get her fucking CD anywhere.  I introduced her to DJ Who Kid.  I mean, this is the next step in her career.  And we talked about her dumb fucking CD.  Enough with her.  Well, I guess the voicemails got nastier.  Oh, did they?  You always wind up fucking me.  Wow.  And you should drop dead, too.  And don't ever fucking call me again. 
[01:05:30]  I am going to the police.  I see.  And if you call me again, I am going to do a charge of harassment against you guys.  I'm very friendly with the cops in New York, by the way.  Yeah, we don't know any.  I'm sure they ride you occasionally.  What's wrong with her?  She's threatening us?  What the fuck?  With the police?  Would you stop it, you old fucking whore?  Stop.  I'm tired of her.  She forgot her hat.  She's getting mad at. 
[01:06:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, everyone's surprised that Sandy Cain is mentally ill.  Yeah, that's true.  She has a fucking growth on her vagina that she named.  And people are upset that she's not reacting properly to a lost hat.  Gee, why wouldn't she handle this rationally?  The picture of the stolen hat on Sam's head.  Forgotten hat.  Is up for your viewing pleasure.  I'm from New York, by the way.  And they like me.  They treat me with respect. 
[01:06:30]  Not like you.  And I'm telling you, Steve, don't ever fucking call me again or I'll kill you.  I will take a gun and fucking kill you and tell Opie that fucking piece of shit to go  fuck himself and help you all fucking drop it.  Pause this for a second.  Message from Sandy Cain.  Holy shit. 
[01:07:00]  Well, I hope she does go to the police and file a report because her leaving a voicemail saying,  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to take a gun and shoot you.  Probably nothing wrong with that.  Death threat right there.  Oh, there is.  Oh.  You know how nice I was to her after the show?  Who saw it?  Well.  Thank you.  No, extremely nice.  It made me uncomfortable.  I'm like, I can't believe I'm being so nice.  And I actually walked her out.  I think she probably dialed the phone number that you gave her as yours.  Oh, she's mad at me because I didn't give her my real cell number? 
[01:07:30]  Correct.  Why would you?  And tell Opie that fucking piece of shit to go fuck himself and help you all fucking drool.  Drop dead, you scumbags.  Eat shit.  End of message.  This is so Mel Gibson-y.  Eat shit.  End of message.  End of message.  She so doesn't get that hat back.  Oh, man.  Without somebody shitting in it.  Yeah.  Do you want to see that?  Who can shit in the hat? 
[01:08:00]  D-Boy's probably got a good one, right?  Oh, no.  She doesn't get that fucking hat back.  Shit in her fucking hat.  It's not our problem.  She left her fucking hat behind.  Exactly.  She forgot it.  There's one more message.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  This is the real Sandy Kane, by the way.  Yeah, of course.  This is the one that is very lonely in her apartment when she isn't doing the naked cowgirl shit.  Drunk.  You mean so?  Next message.  And I am filing, I'm going to the police department and filing a police report that you robbed my hat. 
[01:08:30]  I am filing a police report.  Give me your money.  Exactly.  You robbed the hat.  What did we take?  We stole a retard out from under her hat.  And it was her.  So she's filing a police report.  ...report that you robbed my hat.  Because if it wasn't robbed, you would have the courtesy to call me and say, Sandy, you forgot your hat up here.  And why don't you pick it up? 
[01:09:00]  I know how much it means to you and your business as the naked cowgirl.  Well, I am filing a police report that you robbed me.  Because when I went in there, I saw Sam Roberts and Danny.  They were looking at each other.  All my shit was on the floor without the hat.  So I forgot it because I was so bullshitted by you people.  If you call yourself people and tell Opie thanks for giving me his wrong cell phone number. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, that's why she's mad at me.  Exactly.  She got mad at me.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Why would I give her my cell number?  She gets mad when people give her the wrong number.  My mother doesn't even have my cell number.  Here's what's going to happen.  That's sad.  Not really.  I am taking the hat after work.  It's up to you.  And I am going down to the fucking range.  Yes!  With my Desert Eagle 50 cal.  And I am blasting fucking holes in that hat. 
[01:10:00]  I swear to you, that's what I'm doing today.  I'm going to the fucking range and I am wheeling that thing out to a few yards and blasting it with a .50 caliber.  Is the .50 cal the one that is on your table?  No, this is the pistol.  Okay.  But it's a Desert Eagle 50 caliber pistol.  It will take chunks out of that hat.  It will absolutely do the job.  Yeah.  She won't be able to wear it, though.  Oh, she can wear it.  There'll be plenty of fucking holes in it.  That's the fucking gun I'm going to use. 
[01:10:30]  And it will devastate that fucking...  There it is.  That's actual size.  It will devastate her dumb hat.  And I'm going to videotape it.  I can't wait.  And then send her the video.  She's pissed because I didn't give her my cell number.  Yes.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Give her my number.  If you're bullshitted by you people, if you call yourself people, and tell Opie thanks  for giving me his wrong cell phone number, and Sam giving me his wrong number, thank you 
[01:11:00]  for your friendship, and your...  Believe me, I'm going to the police about this, Steve.  I am fucking fed up that you robbed my fucking hat, and it's the way I make a fucking living  like you do, asshole.  Asshole fat fuck you.  End of message.  She called him a fat fuck.  Asshole fat fuck you.  I was just hurtful and unnecessary. 
[01:11:30]  I was.  Has she called back?  Of course not.  And I can't call her now, because she's going to get a gun and shoot me if I do.  Well, she also said not to call her too early.  Last thing we want to do is inconvenience her.  Yeah.  I think we should probably address this with her on the air.  Steve, you ready?  All right.  Yeah, she wants you to call her about the hat, but she said never call her again.  Yeah, exactly.  How does that work?  Give her a call.  So, all right.  Oh, that thing is going to make a great target.  Great fucking target. 
[01:12:00]  I'll wheel that out.  Blam!  Blam!  Just chunks will fly out of that stupid fucking hat.  Whose head are you going to picture wearing the hat?  Oh!  The original owner.  Annie Oakley.  Look at that dumb hat.  Naked cowgirl on it.  She clipped it out of something.  It's a sticker from where?  Her bumper sticker.  She cut up her bumper sticker.  Did she?  Yeah.  Great.  It looks like a ransom note on the front of her fucking dumb hat. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, she's stupid.  You're not worried she's going to take a gun and shoot you?  She don't have a gun.  Jesus Christ.  What the hell she'd think?  She had a gun.  She'd have used it already.  She's that crazy.  Plow!  That's going to be fun.  Can't wait. 
[01:13:00]  Waiting.  I don't think they got her on the line.  No.  Voicemail.  Voicemail?  I went to voicemail.  Okay.  Oh, damn.  Well, hand over the hat to Anthony.  All right.  Yep.  Put it in a plastic bag, please.  Okay.  I'm going to wear gloves.  I think it'll hang up real nice.  Yep.  Exactly.  Blam!  Blam!  Can't you get a hat like that anywhere?  Yes!  It's not our problem.  She walked out with the most important thing to her outfit.  Her dumb act. 
[01:13:30]  Her dumb act.  Her fucking rip-off act.  It was someone else's act.  I mean...  Yeah.  Someone else's act.  Come on.  Let's be real.  Naked cow...  There's a naked cowboy in New York, and she's going to be the naked cowgirl.  Yeah.  I mean, really?  Come on.  Don't be stupid.  Different gender.  And her best defense is, he's been doing it forever.  You should do something else.  He should do something else.  He wears the same thing.  Yay!  She always says she has nicer outfits than him.  I have nice outfits.  More people come up to me.  She's going to be pretty upset with her.  She's so delusional. 
[01:14:00]  Giant bullet holes.  Oh, giant bullet holes are going to be in her stupid hat.  You don't think she'll like it?  She'll probably be really displeased that Anthony is going to be happy.  Well, we're not happy with the messages she just left there.  You mean the death threats?  Yeah.  Yeah, the death threats.  Not good.  So I think her hat ought to look like Swiss cheese.  We should beat her to the police with the death threat.  That would actually make news, the naked cowgirl threatened.  Yeah, we were fucking behind her, giving her support in the lawsuit. 
[01:14:30]  We should leak these tapes to the Daily News.  And then she forgets her hat and leaves death threats over her hat.  Yeah, that's someone I should be giving my cell phone number to.  Yeah, yeah, see?  Because that would have been to your fucking cell phone.  Yeah, exactly.  And then accuses poor people like myself and Danny.  Yeah.  Of crimes.  Of crimes that we did not commit.  Let's get Ron the lawyer to go after her now.  Oh, my God.  To always switch sides.  Yes, of course.  Death threats. 
[01:15:00]  Death threats.  You were a little fearful of that.  I think I was, too.  I think I'm not sleeping right.  Mm-hmm.  How do we file a report?  Not able to have sex or anything.  You've got to throw that in all the time.  And it's because of Sandy Kane's threats and just thinking of Sandy Kane's body.  That's the sex part.  I just fucking...  I'm a limp noodle.  Let's say hi to Dave in Connecticut.  Dave.  Hey there, Dave.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning. 
[01:15:30]  I was thinking that maybe the fugitive might get his hands on the hat.  You might have to go find it that way.  I am the...  I make a cowgirl cow hat fugitive.  I have the hat.  You would just get everything wrong.  No, no, no.  I'm...  Every day his clue would be that he's in Maspeth.  Right.  I'm in Queens.  I live there.  You could find your hats and... 
[01:16:00]  Oh, one minute.  I'm on the phone with the radio station.  I'm doing a bit.  They don't know it's me.  They don't know.  They think it's the fugitive.  We talked to him this morning.  Really?  You're bothering him, too?  What a surprise.  He told us yesterday that he took Mr. Maloonigans to the groomer.  His dog.  Yeah.  It doesn't look like a dust mop anymore.  I saw his tweet.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  So we had to call him at 5 o'clock this morning to find out if Mr. Maloonigans made it out of  the groomer, okay?  His dog's name is Mr. Maloonigans?  Yes.  Why?  What is that?  I don't know, but he's...  Travis and me were talking to him yesterday, and he doesn't say my dog.  He just goes...  We go, what are you doing?  And he goes, oh, I just dropped off Mr. Maloonigans at the vet.  Or the groomer.  It might be the best name for a dog I've ever heard.  You know, only a retard would name a dog Mr. Maloonigans.  And refer to him as such.  And Mr. Maloonigans! 
[01:17:00]  He's a schnoodle, and Bobo pronounces it schnoodle.  Schnoodle.  Schnoodle.  He's a schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  His shoulders go up when he says it.  A schnoodle.  He's a schnoodle.  Can we play the fugitive clip?  I want to hear Bobo as the fugitive.  Fugitive.  For the new listeners.  Where he breaks character.  Too long to explain, but you'll see him break his fucking character here.  Fugitive.  Can I ask you, what borough of New York do you live in now? 
[01:17:30]  I live in Queens.  What's happening, fugitive?  Yeah, what happened, fugitive?  No, nothing.  Nothing, I actually, the dog had just walked a little bit too cute.  The dog walked a little bit.  That is the greatest bumble clip ever. 
[01:18:00]  Nothing, the dog walked up, just like, ah, dog walked up.  But he realizes ten seconds later that they have to, they broke character and it might not be a good thing.  What a dick.  He realized, ah, it's great.  But yeah, Mr. Maloonigans is okay.  Mr. Maloonigans is fine.  Did anyone ask him what Mr. Maloonigans means?  Didn't he let his sister name it or something?  Yeah, his sister.  What's wrong with her? 
[01:18:30]  Bobo's sister.  Yeah.  Poor kids.  He has a gift for you, Opie.  Oh, great.  For your son.  Will people just leave me alone?  Bobo's got a gift package for you.  Just leave me the fuck alone.  Will people just leave me alone?  For real.  We heard about it, you're going to like it.  Unless you're a normal human being, then I'd appreciate your contact.  Mr. Maloonigans.  Holy shit.  We told him the groomer was going to put his dog to sleep.  That's wonderful, Sam. 
[01:19:00]  No, no, no, no.  He's going to get groomed so it doesn't look like a dust bob, Mr. Maloonigans.  This morning, don't say he's going to die.  This morning, Travis asked him if the groomer cut the dog's pubes.  And Bobo responded, no, they were already short enough.  You people are fucking ruthless.  Did you tape these calls today? 
[01:19:30]  I mean, we'd run out of time.  We'd call every single day.  We'll get one tomorrow if you want them.  You can't tell him if Mr. Maloonigans is being put to sleep.  Bobo also says he's going to start investing some of his money.  Oh, really?  He's interested in investing?  Yeah, he's thinking about what he's going to start at.  Did he give you a clue?  Well, Derek asked him if he was going to get in on some blue chips, and he said, yeah, that's a possibility.  Where's the company named Blue Chip?  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  He was also thinking about a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Oh, right, right.  He wasn't sure exactly where he was going to go.  Oh, yeah.  Asked him about what type of portfolio he wants.  Yeah, Roth.  Aggressive, or...  He was thinking about some Roth IRAs, maybe, something like that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to try to make a lot of money fast, something that'll give him a little income.  What's he looking for?  Well, he had to talk to his accountant before he got...  His cousin is his accountant.  Oh, the same one that ran the fucking pervert hotel?  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  What a fucking rip, man.  What a collection of dolts we've got coming in and out of this joint.  Sandy Cain all pissed about her dumb hat from her rip-off act.  We're just going to get bullet holes in it.  Which, yeah, I'm taking down and shooting.  Well, she fucking made death threats.  She did.  She certainly did.  We should really fucking pump this up and call a detective.  Yeah.  Where's nothing better to do that could stop her?  Let's file official report. 
[01:21:00]  I'm in residence.  You guys suck.  Fuck you, you fat fuck.  Eat shit.  End of message.  Eat shit.  All right.  Hey, it's a quickie.  You heard about this Ansel Adams thing?  Yeah.  I think this...  Oh, how fucking depressing, dude.  Oh, imagine that.  Holy shit.  I was talking about this before the show.  I think there's a lot of people out there right now, probably people listening to our  voices, that have stuff in their attic or somewhere that is worth a bloody fortune. 
[01:21:30]  But the problem is, you don't know that.  You don't know it.  You have to have a little luck like this person had.  Unless it's comic books or baseball cards, which by now most people know.  Right.  Have someone look at them before you sell them.  Sure.  Yeah.  But negatives of photographs, who would think?  This is unbelievable.  This is...  I bet you Antique Roadshow is bummed out that this didn't appear on their fucking show.  Oh.  Oh.  Right?  Well, here's the story.  Mike, we've got to hit some garage sales this week.  And when you hear the story, you're going to understand why.  Now, a garage sale find turns a construction worker into an instant millionaire. 
[01:22:00]  Multi, multi-millionaire.  I know.  Let's go to garage sales.  He bought a stack of 65 glass negatives at a garage sale 10 years ago for $45.  Not realizing what they are.  They are lost works by famed photographer Ansel Adams.  Now, a team of museum curators and photographers thought these were lost in a studio fire.  Now, the works...  Hold on to your hats.  The works are worth at least $200 million. 
[01:22:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  So, he's just going through a garage sale.  He picks up these glass...  He's like, hey, these are some neat pictures.  $45.  How do you know what he said, bitch?  $45, and it turns out to be works for Ansel Adams.  And he only figured that...  He figured that out, you know, 10 years later.  I wonder how he even figured it out.  Wow.  Good for him.  That's so cool.  Lucky guy.  Lucky guy.  He's been actually trying to have these photos authenticated for a long time.  He's been trying to figure out...  Oh, okay.  And Ansel Adams' people are saying they're not his, but then they had geologists and shit 
[01:23:00]  looking at them, and they said that the photos taken, there were cloud formations in these  pictures that were in some of Ansel Adams' actual photos, that they said it was probably  taken the same day or right after, which means that they really are his.  But then Ansel Adams' people are going, no, those cloud formations happen all the time.  They're trying to say, I guess they don't want to lose all this money.  Of course.  That these are not...  But maybe they're right.  Maybe it was some dummy that went, holy shit, that's Ansel Adams.  He said, he took a shot from this fucking spot. 
[01:23:30]  I'm going to take one.  It's not like everyone had cameras back then, you know?  No, I don't.  That's funny, though, yeah.  Pulls out his digital camera.  It's just some jerk.  His iPhone of the 1800s.  Just following Ansel Adams around.  Yeah.  Taking every shot he took.  But these are so old, dude.  The guy who sold them in the garage sale bought them in the 40s.  Wow.  They were $75.  Wait, this goes back to the 40s?  Yes.  Well, the guy who bought them 10 years ago bought them from a guy at a garage sale.  The guy who owned them from the garage sale, I believe, bought them in the 1940s. 
[01:24:00]  From who?  Don't know.  But paid...  I think the guy wanted $75, and he talked about a $45.  It was like $75 in the 40s or something.  And he said that his friends had even joked, hey, they look like Ansel Adams' pictures.  So people kind of knew that these looked like them.  Fucking...  Wow.  But he lost a third...  Ansel Adams lost a third of his portfolio in a studio fire.  So his people are going...  He was so protective about his negatives after that, he never would have just left these.  But then they said some of the envelopes or whatever had like a little bit of... 
[01:24:30]  What do you call it?  Burned fringe or whatever the fuck it is on them.  Yes.  That could have happened in the fire.  Who knows?  Maybe some fucking fireman saw it and took them.  So are they still arguing this?  Yeah.  I believe they are.  But they've been authenticated by some...  He hired a team of lawyers, and they hired people who did authenticate them.  And a lot of it was cloud formations and stuff like that.  They also used handwriting experts.  To verify...  To say that his...  They used handwriting experts to say that it was his wife's handwriting on one of them. 
[01:25:00]  But there were certain misspellings about Yellowstone that Ansel Adams' people say.  There's two G's in faggots.  But they're saying that his wife was a smart woman and from that area and never would have  misspelled these words.  So there's...  It's back and forth.  But now it hit the news.  So what made this different where they're sort of saying...  I think they finally got them authenticated to a point where it looks like they're really  his.  And have they been fighting this for 10 years?  Oh, yeah.  I think so.  The guy has said that he's gotten so many calls from his construction work. 
[01:25:30]  I think Ansel Adams' people don't want to...  They probably want to find a way.  Because, I mean, it's a calendar that would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars probably around  the world, right?  And his works look very original.  Well, they were in the darkroom is where a lot of it was done.  So they said that these negatives...  I mean, again, the family's trying to make it look like these are shit.  Like, they're worthless.  Because it was what he did with them in the darkroom or whatever.  But it's like, they're not worthless.  Yeah.  Can I see some of those pictures, Danny?  He really was a...  He had a really weird thing he did with...  I used to love Ansel Adams' stuff.  Shadowing or whatever?  Yeah, I used to love his shit. 
[01:26:00]  I don't have them...  Very contrasty.  It was an easy thing to buy for your stupid college dorm.  That's Ansel Adams' fucking poster.  Yeah.  I guess he was a good photographer, right?  Like, one of the...  Well, what do you think?  I don't know.  It's a good picture, but it doesn't mean much to me.  He took some...  Very focused in the foreground and background.  Yeah.  A lot of that was in the...  I guess the...  I almost said the editing room, but the darkroom.  I don't know what made his pictures so great.  I have no idea.  You just have a great look to him. 
[01:26:30]  I think what helped is the black and white thing, right?  Yeah, the black and white thing is pretty good.  Black and white is pretty cool shit.  The originals are like $700,000, some of them.  I mean, they're really expensive.  Fucking Ansel Adams.  Fuck him in the ass.  Yeah, he's dead.  I want my negatives.  Hey, give me back.  Someone still robbed them.  I'm calling the police again.  This guy's a little more info.  Jimmy did a great job explaining.  Mike has just one little piece to add.  Mike, New York.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, how am I? 
[01:27:00]  The way they did authenticate them is, Jimmy, you're right.  What made Ansel Adams so great is he actually invented a photography technique called zone  photography, and so they can tell by looking at them that they're his.  What's the resistance from his estate?  Is it probably because they want to find a way to get them cheaper?  Yeah, they want to find a way to get them cheaper,  and they said that the handwriting didn't match up, that there were misspellings, 
[01:27:30]  that Ansel Adams' wife would have never misspelled.  They're full of shit.  They're just upset they lost them.  She was a dummy.  But now, are they going to try to backtrack and figure out, because the guy who bought  them bought them from a warehouse, I think, in the 40s.  Where?  In California.  In Los Angeles.  A warehouse.  I answered that.  And they said that makes them also his, because he had an office or whatever, or his studio  was in Pasadena or some shit.  So it really looks like they're his.  But how did they get into that? 
[01:28:00]  Did that warehouse have the right to sell them?  I mean, I'm surprised they're not suing.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You own anything valuable?  No, I don't.  I have things that are valuable to me.  Like, I have a lot of things that are very valuable to me.  That's what I mean, though.  We could all say that.  To me.  But truly valuable?  I had comic books when I was a kid, but I sold them to drink.  I sold a lot of my Kiss paraphernalia is worth a lot of money.  Like, older Kiss stuff.  Not like that valuable.  But I sold all that to drink.  Yeah, not like Ansel Adams stuff.  No.  Some Gene Sims.  I have a beautiful Aussie photo that I paid a couple grand for. 
[01:28:30]  That's just the most valuable picture I have.  Wow.  Yeah, but if you try to sell that, what would you get?  Probably a couple grand for it.  From another fan, right?  Oh, yeah.  Beautiful picture of Aussie in the 70s.  There's people out there right now who have no idea what they got in their fucking house.  That always drives me nuts.  We threw out a stupid, who the fuck was it?  It was some baseball card.  Oh, some fucking guy.  Fucking Honee Wagner.  It was just like, it was so enough.  Honee. 
[01:29:00]  Honest.  Honest.  I knew where you were going with that.  I don't want kids buying tobacco for my card.  Tobacco card.  My dad used to tell us that he had a baseball signed by Babe Ruth.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And for most of our lives, when we were growing up anyway, in the house, we're like, well,  where the fuck is this baseball?  He's like, I don't know.  I don't know.  I think maybe your grandma has it, or I don't know.  I think it's sad to your uncle. 
[01:29:30]  The story always changed.  But he swore that we had a fucking autographed baseball from Babe Ruth.  Did you guys?  Why didn't you just go raid the attics?  Oh, trust me.  We checked out our attic.  He looked around.  Yeah.  We don't have no Babe Ruth autographed baseball.  But he swore by it, that he had a baseball autograph by Babe Ruth when he was a kid.  And, you know, he just didn't know where it ended up.  Yeah.  There are people struggling with bills right now and arguing about money.  And meanwhile, they got a fortune.  Yeah.  I mean, my dad was a kid when Babe Ruth was playing. 
[01:30:00]  And Babe Ruth just used to walk the neighborhoods.  And fucking he was the coolest.  Just signing shit.  Fucking broads.  Yeah.  Just a cool dude.  I was in one of those paraphernalia shops, whatever they're called, in Vegas.  And I would buy autographed.  You know where I'd buy an autographed baseball?  Like, I was in Yankee Stadium last year.  I would buy an autographed Yankee baseball in the stadium.  Because they're real.  You know, they're not going to sell phony shit in the stadium.  But in Vegas, behind a glass thing, they had a Babe Ruth ball. 
[01:30:30]  But it was signed with that fucking awful blue marker that you see everybody sign with.  Yeah.  Who's fucking buying that thinking it's a real Babe Ruth ball?  I don't get it.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  What an asshole.  Blue Sharpie.  You don't think it was real?  No.  It's Bob Ruth.  Bob Ruth.  Bobo.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm here.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:31:00]  I said Bobo.  Hey.  Hi.  This guy sold a fountain pen for $1,000, bought it for $35.  I mean, that's...  A fountain pen.  We're talking about this guy, $45 into $200 million.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  Fuck.  Someone did buy a Honus Wagner car at a garage sale once.  Yeah?  Yeah, he bought a bunch of baseball cards for $800, just like a huge box, just random baseball 
[01:31:30]  cards, and one of the 1909 Wagner cards was in there.  Wow.  Who the fuck sold...  Who knew to sell it for $800 but didn't know that Honus Wagner is a million-dollar card?  Is it a million-dollar card now?  At least I think.  It's the most expensive baseball card.  Yeah, no, we all know that, but...  It's so rare.  I mean, I know Wayne Gretzky co-owns one of them with someone else.  I think he might have sold that one.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, I think so.  Co-own a card.  The problem is, again, the story, Honus Wagner did not want kids buying tobacco to get his 
[01:32:00]  card, so he had his card pulled.  So very few survived.  I'll pull your card.  You ever see a card come apart like that?  I want to know what it's worth right now.  One of those cards.  Are mint condition...  I don't have to admit, but the best condition ones are fucking...  The last one sold went for $2.8 million.  Jesus.  Why?  That must have been in great condition, though.  Why?  Yeah, there's only a certain amount of them, and there's like one or two that are just 
[01:32:30]  in fantastic condition.  So those are the ones that sell.  They're probably in like...  They're in special cases that are like airproof or whatever, right?  I'd love to take one and just put my spokes...  I was going to say...  I'm sure you don't have it just laying around your coffee table.  Yeah.  It would be too much pressure to own something like that.  Wouldn't it be just insane to own that?  I mean, that much money in a fucking baseball card? 
[01:33:00]  I don't know.  No, I couldn't do it.  Even in a safe deposit box?  No, no.  You'd be like, well, what happens if the bank burns down?  Right, right.  Or something.  Bought pearls at a tag sale.  All right, well, there's a couple stories coming in.  What the hell?  Let's go with...  A funny-looking gentleman he was.  Let's go to Priscilla in Freeport.  Priscilla.  Priscilla.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Yeah, I went to a tag sale with my husband, and it was inside.  It was up in Laurel Hollow, so it was a beautiful area.  He went inside. 
[01:33:30]  He was looking at a whole room full of books and oil paintings, and we were just walking  around, and there was a case where you checked out and paid for stuff, and in the case was  like a lot of costume jewelry and stuff, and I saw a set of pearls, like four strands  of pearls, but the clasp on them looked really nice.  And I said, can I see those?  And she said, yeah.  I said, how much?  And I'm holding them in my hand, and they just felt like really heavy to me.  I'm not a jewelry person, but they looked really nice.  She said, I don't know, $5. 
[01:34:00]  And I'm like, wow, that's weird.  So I had a $5 bill, and I handed it to her.  She said, oh, you want a bag?  I'm like, no, no, no, and I walked out, and I called my husband on his cell phone, and  I said, let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  He said, I was looking at the book.  I said, let's go.  So we walked out, and I'm looking in the sun at the clasp on the way out, and they say  Tiffany on the clasp.  Oh.  And I've had them authenticated since then.  How much are they worth?  $40,000.  She turned five. 
[01:34:30]  That's a retail price.  It's like if you were to buy them in Tiffany's, it would be worth $40,000.  Can I tell you the beauty of this?  This is human nature, and I probably would have done it, too.  Right.  It is using $5 to steal from that lady.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  It wasn't them.  I didn't buy it from the owners.  That's the thing.  Who'd you buy it from?  The tag sale people.  Believe me, they bought the places a lot.  No, no, no, no.  I know you weren't stealing them, but I mean, knowing that you were, and again, I probably  would do the same thing.  No, no.  No.  But like, let's get out of here. 
[01:35:00]  Let's get out of here.  Fuck her.  Fuck her.  Yeah, you knew right off the bat with the let's go, let's go that you had something.  I did.  I did.  I wanted to go outside, and I wanted to read the class, because I could see there was  something in Boston, the class.  Yeah, I would probably do the same thing.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So I did.  And I've gotten other things, too.  I bought some beautiful prints at like a second-hand store that I've done very well, but I go  a lot.  I do a lot of tag selling.  Yeah.  More selling garage selling.  Yeah, you got all nice stuff, but you live in Freeport. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, I live in a beautiful home, in a beautiful area.  Really.  But it's Freeport.  What's wrong with Freeport?  Well, you're kind of close.  No, it's beautiful.  Well, you're, you know what, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're close.  Close to what?  Oh, I'm here.  I, I, I'm here.  Yeah, yeah.  What's she close to?  Well, you know what Freeport is.  I live in a mixed, I, I live, my, my neighbors are all doctors and lawyers, and they're, I  live in a really mixed area.  It's beautiful.  No, really.  Beautiful old house.  Freeport.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  I mean.  Through Freeport a couple of times.  I know.  I know.  It's not your thing.  I know there's some areas, but like I said, it's close.  Well, my neighborhood is mostly Jewish and, and African American, I think.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  It's really mixed.  Surprise.  And it's been mixed since the 30s, this neighborhood.  Oh, yeah?  I bet it was a little different in the 30s.  No, actually, well.  Jesus, Anne, she lives in a mixed neighborhood, and she's happy.  You got yourself a dog, do you?  I got four dogs.  Yeah, I wonder why you have the dogs.  No!  That's curious. 
[01:36:30]  That's curious.  That's all.  That's all I'm saying.  Some people can live in a mixed neighborhood, Anne, and have no problems.  I understand, all right?  I understand.  That's why I'm not saying a word.  I'm just saying.  And you're saying that I'm white.  I am, but, you know.  All right, Priscilla, good story.  Very nice.  Thank you.  We'll end it here before it gets uglier.  You thief.  Let's go to Doug in Wisconsin.  Doug.  Hey, there was a guy in Connecticut a few years ago that bought a painting at a tag sale, 
[01:37:00]  but he got it just for the frame.  He didn't even care what the painting was.  Took the painting out of it, and behind it, hidden behind that in the backing, was an  original copy of the Declaration of Independence, and that guy sold that for millions.  Yeah, I heard about that one.  That was a couple of years back.  Can you imagine?  You open it up, and you got the Declaration of Independence.  Can you imagine?  Like, oh, this is good.  I own this now.  Holy shit.  I own a copy of the Declaration of Independence.  Oh, yeah.  It's usually behind something.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what the guy just said.  Let's say hi to Paul in Jersey. 
[01:37:30]  Paul.  Hey, Opie, you must be my long-lost brother, because my father also had an autographed  baseball, and he can't find it.  By the way, I'm not bragging.  I'm wondering if my dad was just bullshitting us to look like a better father or something.  Yeah, I always believed him, but he could never find it.  He was kind of pissed, so I think he did really have one.  Yeah.  Watch out, buddy.  All right, so you had pretty much the same thing, an autographed Babe Ruth ball that no  one could find.  Go, go, go for you. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, can you imagine this happening?  Footer.  Go ahead, Footer.  Get up, guys.  I don't even know if fucking this is worth anything, but I had, in like 87, I went to  LaGuardia Airport for something, and I saw, like, the chauffeur guy holding up a little  sign that said, The Champ, and I had no idea what that meant or whatever, and sure enough,  fucking Muhammad Ali came walking out, and I ended up walking over getting his autographed,  so me and my papa were on the back of a little boarding pass thing, so me and my papa  were driving back on the Grand Central with bullshit and laughing, like, oh, this is fucking  great. 
[01:38:30]  The little fucking paper flew out of my hand.  I was, you know, I was maybe fucking 12, and it fucking flew out the window on the Grand  Central.  Did you get, did you pull over and get it, you dope?  I don't know.  Jimmy, I'm fucking, we're doing 60 on the Grand Central.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I don't know how you pull over and find that.  Yeah, getting that back.  You know, and then, uh, real quick, another little one, my neighbor was best friends with  John Muckler, who was, like, the assistant coach for Edmonton Oilers back in the day  when, like, Gretzky and those guys were on it, and I ended up getting fucking the entire  fucking, like, Gretzky and all the fucking great fucking Oilers on the team that year, 
[01:39:00]  and I fucking lost that, too.  Jesus.  Yali at one is probably not worth that much.  I mean.  It's worth it to you, though.  Can you imagine?  Right, emotionally.  Because that's the one guy I would love to get him to sign something.  Well, the biggest signature I ever got was Groucho Marx.  Yeah, high school graduation, right?  Yes, high school graduation.  I was a little tater, and it was right before he dropped dead, and he was in a wheelchair,  and he signed a little picture of himself for me. 
[01:39:30]  Dear faggot.  Dear faggot.  Stop crying.  Stop fucking weeping, you fruit.  You don't have the autograph, though, right?  Nope.  I think we've talked about this.  You don't know where it is?  Don't know where it went, where it was, but there I had it.  A Groucho Marx autograph.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Jason, Ohio.  One more, and then we'll move on.  I think Steven Adler is here.  We're going to talk to him in a few minutes from Guns N' Roses fame, of course.  Yes, Jason.  Hey there, characters.  I got a Babe Ruth story, too. 
[01:40:00]  It's like you, Opie.  My uncle was Babe Ruth's caddy back in the 20s, and we had the infamous ball, too, that  my grandmother said she had.  The thing is, my brother, who's a couple years old, said he saw it, and then it also  disappeared.  My grandmother moved, so we did what you did.  We ripped the entire house apart one day, looking for it.  We never found it.  We had an aunt who was into drugs, and we think she sold it.  For drugs.  Yeah.  I'm starting to think it might have been the thing to say. 
[01:40:30]  Really?  Yes.  My parents just decided they were going to say they had a Babe Ruth ball.  Just a third one.  Yeah, I heard it, too, growing up, because I grew up just outside New York City, and everyone  said they had an uncle or a relative that knew him, and they had a ball, and no one could  ever produce it.  It's kind of like an urban legend.  Like, oh, we got the Babe Ruth ball.  But I never saw one.  Everyone's always said they had them, or someone said they, you know, it's kind of like a  Bigfoot sighting.  Like, oh, yeah, we think we saw it, but you never prove it. 
[01:41:00]  But the Honus Wagner car, too, just to go back to it real quick, there's about 23 of  them known that are in existence, and Jimmy kind of hit.  They're in this thing called a slab.  There's a company called PSA, DNA, where they put it in this, like, plastic thing that's  tamper-proof, and it's bar-coded, so they know where everyone is exactly in the country.  But there was one that turned up a couple years ago.  This guy in Cincinnati is a garbage man, said he found one in the garbage, and they have  conflicting reports on if they can validate the authenticity.  Because they think the guy's kind of a shyster. 
[01:41:30]  Fake.  One independent test saying the paper was from the era, but PSA wouldn't say it was, they  said it was fake, that these guys were trying to, you know, the guy was trying to get, like,  20 or 30 grand for it.  And, you know, so, a couple other things.  That car, yeah, it's like a Moby Dick thing.  Keeps going.  Yeah, well, it's good.  It's info, though.  I was going to add to it.  Could you imagine if somebody found in some really old warehouse a whole box of Honus Wagner  cards?  Oh, it just totally brought down the value.  Where when they yanked them off the market, you know, they put them in one box and just 
[01:42:00]  put them in a...  And that, you would think that was...  And there's 80,000.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  You'd think that would be the greatest thing ever, but no, that would bring the price down  to everyone that actually has one.  You'd have to just take one out, the best one.  And just fucking burn the box.  And sell it, yeah.  Just so you're not tempted.  Wow.  Groucho Marx was born in 1890.  Oh, no one.  So weird.  And I got his autograph.  So weird.  I had gotten his autograph. 
[01:42:30]  He was born in 1890.  He's old.  Holy shit.  I used to do that weird math shit, like, when my niece was just like a newborn, my grandma  held my niece.  And she was 90 at the time.  Yeah.  And then, you know, my niece, you know, God willing, will live to whatever, 80, 90 years.  It'll be a ridiculous stretch of time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And just those two people.  Yeah.  Somebody like...  Like, somebody held us that was born in the 1800s.  Huh? 
[01:43:00]  Paul.  I was thinking that, like, I shook Groucho's hand, and he had been held as a baby from somebody  that could have possibly been born in the 1700s.  Yeah.  I also thought of that and then realized the Big Bang happened 13 billion years ago.  It's all relative.  We're all worthless lumps.  Yeah.  It's just nothingness.  It's all relative.  Is Adler here or no?  He's coming.  No, I was just teasing him.  Oh.  His book, I can't stop looking. 
[01:43:30]  It's fucking unbelievable.  Yeah.  These books with these artists...  Dude, it's great.  They're awesome.  Yeah.  It's got pitches.  Yeah, but I'm looking through it.  It's short little bursts, these chapters, and it's fucking great.  You think he's still...  Yeah, a shitter book?  You can read it on the shitter.  Easily.  You think he's sober?  I hope so, man.  The only reason I ask, he was on Celebrity Rehab, one of the greatest people to ever do  Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.  I certainly hope so.  Wandering around, couldn't figure out if his room was on the second floor or the first floor.  Yeah, he was fucked up.  Just amazing, amazing video. 
[01:44:00]  What are the pictures of?  Just him with...  Guns.  Guns.  Yeah, Guns and Roses.  All right, I think we're done with this topic, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mother gave away James Brown's stage outfit.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Why?  Why wouldn't you want that?  Give it away.  Because you don't think this shit's worth anything.  Who wouldn't think that was something special? 
[01:44:30]  That's true.  Why don't we get ready for Steven Adler?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Underpires.  Sirius XM.  Going to be talking to Steven Adler.  In a little bit.  Running late.  He's on a train.  Coming from Philly, I think.  Ah, Philly.  He's got a new book out that Jimmy's reading. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And loving my appetite for destruction, sex, and drugs, and guns, and roses.  Mm-hmm.  There's gay sex stories in his book.  Quite some telling things in there.  Oh.  Quite the tell-all book.  Supposedly, I don't know.  Who gave him the quaaludes and then would have...  Where's...  Whatever, let's see.  They would give Steven Adler quaaludes and then have their way with him.  Have, as he put it in the book, their way with him. 
[01:45:30]  I want to talk about his mother.  What about her?  Now, your mom kind of kicked you out at 18, right, Ant?  Said, 18, it's time for you to, you know, see the world.  I think it was like 20.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, 20.  I got the boots.  Supposedly, Steven Adler's mom kicked him out at 11.  How do you kick out an 11-year-old?  That's fucking lunacy.  11?  You can't really expect a kid to go out and earn his keep at 11.  Aren't most 11, 12, 13-year-olds problems? 
[01:46:00]  And, yeah, you can't really get a job.  Yeah.  It's a little rough.  What did the mom expect him to do?  Get an apartment.  I would love to know why he was kicked out at 11 years old.  Could be drugs, alcohol.  But then there's a rumor that the mom and the pops there, or the stepfather,  gambled away all his money.  So what's that story about?  Oof.  To the tune of between 10 and 20 million.  I was going to say, it's probably a lot of money.  Between 10 and 20 million, supposedly, Steven Adler's mother and stepfather 
[01:46:30]  gambled the money away.  That Guns N' Roses money.  I guess.  Wow.  Did the state give Steven Adler's mom the money?  Because he wasn't in the proper place?  Maybe, or maybe he had some kind of joint account thing with them or something.  Unbelievable.  I'm reading over the bullet points, Jimmy, of the Steven Adler book.  Looks great.  We're trying to figure out why a mom would kick out a kid at 11 years old.  Well, there's rumors.  It's suspected that she gambled away some of his money. 
[01:47:00]  So maybe that's just that mentality, you know?  She's just nuts.  Maybe an addict.  I don't know.  She has to be nuts.  You can't kick an 11-year-old out.  What happened with his mom on Celebrity Rehab?  Wasn't there some kind of a thing with them?  Well, she came to visit, and it was, whew.  A little drama?  A little drama.  Some drama.  Drama.  They don't really get along.  I don't, you know.  So, it should be a great interview.  The book is very, very good.  I'm looking at it, and it's like little, some of the chapters are a half page, and it's just 
[01:47:30]  these great little headings and stories.  Some rock biographies are boring, and some of this looks amazing.  He went through three attempted suicides.  Wow.  28 drug overdoses and two heart attacks.  Is that the, you know, suicide that isn't really a suicide?  I want to ask him about it.  If it's three failed, you know.  That means a dumb slash across the wrist.  Help me.  That doesn't get anything done, people.  I'm going to kill my son. 
[01:48:00]  Do what the guy did on the east side, I think, over the weekend.  You hear about this guy?  What do you do?  Actually, it's another problem we have.  Guy jumps.  A lot of jumpers in New York.  Yeah.  And this guy went crashing into an outdoor Starbucks table while people were very, very  close enjoying their lattes.  That is selfish.  A lot of days.  That is real selfish.  Oh, damn, man.  Would he jump out of a building?  Yeah, he jumped out of a building, killed himself, and went on a fucking outdoor table at a Starbucks. 
[01:48:30]  You can't do that to people.  They're going to be traumatized.  That's extremely selfish.  It really is.  We had one.  We had, remember at N.E.W.?  Yeah.  Lunchtime, we got word that some dude jumped.  By the Harley Davidson Cafe when that was open over there.  So that's what, Fifth Avenue and somewhere in the 50s probably, right?  And a bunch of us ran down there.  I had no desire, but they brought pictures back of this guy.  Some woman was walking down the sidewalk and his arm hit her shoulder. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  Just grazed it, but knocked her right to the ground.  Right.  Like that energy.  And there's sidewalk pizza right next to her.  And then he just explodes right next to her.  And she's got to deal with that now the rest of her life.  Fuck.  That horror show every time she closes her eyes.  I give you respect for jumping, because that definitely means you want to kill and will kill yourself.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not a cry for help.  But no respect for not looking ahead of time to make sure you don't take out innocent people.  And just even thinking about other people's emotional health after they have to see that. 
[01:49:30]  Also, the people that jump in front of trains usually wind up fucking up the engineer, the guy driving the train.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because the guy feels bad.  He doesn't want to run people over and shit.  That's true.  And then suicide by cop is another one that's really fucking selfish.  They pull out and fucking, you know.  And then the cop has to shoot.  The cop shoots him.  He doesn't really feel like killing anyone.  Yeah, he's all traumatized.  The best way, you know, is fucking be alone. 
[01:50:00]  Just be alone somewhere where it isn't a cry for help and just, you know, do whatever you feel you've got to do.  Respect for the suicide in a garage with the car on?  All depends on who's going to find you also.  That's another thing.  You can't traumatize people that are going to open a door and see you covered in vomit all blue and just fucked up.  True.  Like, I don't know.  I think a little more thought has to go into it.  There it is.  See, I'm not lying.  Upper East Side man falls to his death, lands in Starbucks seating area. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Look at that.  Yeah.  That was over the weekend.  Police get the fuck out of here tape over there.  Right.  Where exactly was it?  I think East Side, I want to say like in the 90s, somewhere around there.  If that was me, I would have probably took my thing and went, well, thanks a lot today to the guy, you know?  Yeah.  I'd have done that too.  Out of the face.  85th and 1st Avenue.  85th and 1st.  85th and 1st.  You know, maybe bridges are pretty good because you're not going to fuck up anybody. 
[01:51:00]  You're not going to like, no one's going to really see you.  But you've got to find the body because the family wants some kind of closure.  Yeah.  That's another problem.  But then it's professionals.  It's the cops that are looking for you.  I must say, I think Brad Delp showed nothing but care with his suicide.  He put a note on the door, right?  Put a note on the door.  Said, what, don't come in here? 
[01:51:30]  Exactly.  I might look a little fucked up.  I think he even made sure the dogs were in the backyard so he didn't kill any dogs.  And he did put a note.  Like, look, you don't want to fucking open this door right now.  And that way, at least you could call the professionals and they're used to it.  And you want to open the door because you smell barbecue.  You're like, God, who doesn't like the smell of barbecue?  It smells delicious in there.  You've got to investigate.  It smells delicious.  So there was a little trickery there because there's a note.  Why wouldn't you open the door to smell a barbecue? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but the note is good because then the people come in and a coroner comes in and takes them.  I really hate making Brad Delp jokes knowing that we met him.  I know.  And Ants sang with him back in the day, back in the day.  That was great.  And honestly, just a fucking great guy.  And then something happened.  Well, I don't know what that is.  Something happened.  Uh, yeah, this guy has one.  Jesus.  We've got some phone topics today. 
[01:52:30]  Jesus is on the phone.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hello.  Unintentional phone topics today.  Yes, Captain Jack.  I used to work at the Planet Hollywood right in Times Square.  And at one point, some lady jumped off the top of the Marriott.  There used to be that moving planners peanut sign.  Yeah, okay.  She hit it.  It ripped her in half and half of her just dropped into Times Square.  Is that selfish, Ant?  Yeah, that's pretty fucking selfish.  There's a lot of selfish things in that story.  A lot of people, little children walking about, and they've got to see half a human just laying in the street like that. 
[01:53:00]  I don't know.  Some guy jumped off the Empire State Building recently.  He was a young guy.  Yeah, no one ever makes it to the bottom, though, which is pretty good.  They hit like that.  They hit a ledge.  The ledge coming out.  Yeah.  But can you imagine?  So they probably fall about 80 stories.  Yeah, yeah.  But can you imagine, like, I've been at the top of the Empire State Building, climbing out of those bars, knowing you're going to jump, and security trying to talk you out of it, and you're going, no, I've got to go.  Nah, I'm going to go. 
[01:53:30]  But you mean to do it.  Take it easy.  And you do it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's fucked.  And that guy means to do it.  Dude, he's...  If you're doing that, you meant to do it.  I would be on the outside going, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Look at where I am.  Help me.  Do you guys remember the base jumper last year?  Oh, yeah.  Who fucking...  They grabbed his legs.  They grabbed him, and they held him.  He was trying to put the base jump off the Empire State Building.  He was like, you're going to kill me.  He goes, you've got to cut the parachute off, because if it opens while I'm handcuffed to this, it's just going to rip my arm off. 
[01:54:00]  It's going to pull me off and rip my arm off.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you're going to kill me.  He just wanted to be let go so he can base jump or be dragged back over the rail, not handcuffed.  Jesus Christ.  Unbelievable.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody?  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  I know that one of you had mentioned that it existed a few years ago, but have any of you actually seen the documentary The Bridge?  Not only did I see the documentary, we had the guy in, we had the director in, and then we had on the phone the guy that survived jumping off the fucking Golden Gate Bridge. 
[01:54:30]  Wow, look at me, the super fan.  Fuck, sorry.  No, it's okay.  Do you mean the other documentary about the dentist?  No.  No, I highly recommend it.  It's fucking heartbreaking, wonderful documentary.  Let me tell you something.  Listen, I walked across the Golden Gate Bridge last summer.  We're not across, we're halfway to check it out.  And just walking on the bridge is horrifying.  Yeah.  It really is. 
[01:55:00]  Kind of crawling out.  The railing in some parts are only up to like a little past your waist because they don't want to fuck up the view and all that.  I can't, and then I look down, I can't imagine what it takes.  I don't care you're in a bad spot.  I can't imagine what it takes to actually release yourself and do it.  Me and my friends used to go to the Verrazano Bridge and get out and just dance on the catwalks and the cables.  It was a lot of fun.  Double J and, yeah, we'd have a blast. 
[01:55:30]  Do we have the interview with the guy?  I don't know.  How long is that interview?  It might be worth playing because that's not something you hear every day, an actual survivor that jumped off a fucking bridge and survived.  He basically told us what went on in his head as soon as he jumped.  And I think what he said was as soon as he jumped, he realized this was a massive fucking mistake.  Yeah, that's right.  All of a sudden, all the problems he thought he had, as soon as he jumped, he realized, I don't have any fucking problems. 
[01:56:00]  That's amazing how so many people probably go through that.  Did you see the documentary?  I did, yeah.  For the people that don't know about this documentary, filmmakers set up cameras on both sides of the bridge, I believe.  It's been a while, so I'm not positive.  And they just filmed the bridge 24-7 for a long time.  I don't remember the period of time.  And they caught a lot of people jumping.  A lot.  They said they were doing it to film traffic patterns.  That's how they got the rights to do it.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, they were a little sneaky about it because they knew that's a destination for a lot of people. 
[01:56:30]  Did you realize this?  There's destinations for people to kill themselves at?  Yeah.  And one of them, it's a known fact that people will go all the way to San Francisco to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.  To landmark, yeah.  And in this documentary, it's from afar, but you see the people, you see the splash in the water of these people jumping.  Yeah.  And they got a close-up of the one guy, I don't know how many people are going to see this movie, so the guy with the black jacket, I think it was?  The long black coat?  He's kind of thinking it over.  They tease him through the whole movie.  He's teased through the whole movie.  And then he not only got on the rail, he did basically a back-fucking-flip. 
[01:57:00]  He fucking fell backwards with his arms in the air.  It was almost artistic.  And the whole thing, they're interviewing people from these people's lives, like their families and their friends.  And the thing that was amazing to me is that you could see that people were annoyed already with these suicidal people and their attention-seeking.  And it's like, even though it's sad, people were almost like, enough already.  Yeah.  Out of you.  Right. 
[01:57:30]  You're fucking dead.  You're sad.  Shut up.  Right.  We got it.  Message received.  Oh, here it is.  You know what?  You don't even need to see the documentary.  You can go to YouTube.  What's the title there, Danny?  On this one, it's, if you just put in the bridge, suicide, you'll get some stuff.  Ronnie James Dio jumping off the bridge.  You'll get the guy I just talked about with the long, like, trench coat, black trench coat, and he jumps backwards.  His annoyed friends.  Not the way he was going.  It's a rough documentary. 
[01:58:00]  I'm not going to lie to you, but it's pretty, it's really, really fascinating.  And you know what?  We play a bit between us and Ronda Fez.  Maybe we can play the interview with the guy that jumped and survived, if it's not that long.  That'd be cool.  Because that's something you just don't hear every day.  He's just thinking it over.  He's sitting, he's standing there, just kind of, you know.  Yeah, they're focused on this guy.  Okay, and the filmmakers knew which ones were a potential jumper.  Yep.  It was shot from the base of the bridge, the bottom of the bridge.  Somebody could have got up there and helped him.  And actually, for the documentary to be good, he had to go. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Why did you do that?  Yeah, they're focused in on this guy, so they, he's on the rail.  I wonder how many people, though, they focused in on that just kind of walked away, spit off the bridge and then walked away.  Well, that's what's great about the documentary, too, because they did do exactly that.  They thought they had a potential jumper, and you're like, holy shit, and then you realize they're just kind of sightseeing and walk away.  So the anxiety you feel, wondering which ones were going to jump or not.  Oh, shit, here goes the guy who's going to jump, and then, and, uh, throws a rock off the bridge. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, his friend is mad.  Disturbed is an interesting one.  Well, this goes on forever.  It's a really long clip, unfortunately.  Yeah.  So, you also realize how much it fucks other people up, though, when you do it.  It's like, you really do leave a fucking, a path of human wreckage behind you.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  It's like a selfish.  It is just a selfish thing to do.  Stop it.  A guy he works with hit a guy cometing suicide. 
[01:59:30]  Cometing.  Cometing suicide in his truck before he hit ground.  Let's try this one instead.  Andrea in, uh, is it Minnesota, Michigan?  Where are you there, Andrea?  Michigan, yeah.  And you work, you work for a death cleanup company?  I love these people.  Oh.  Yeah, that is correct.  What a job.  What, what did you want to be when you were growing up?  A ballerina?  I wanted to be a veterinarian.  Great.  But instead, you're wiping someone's guts off walls so they could resell the place. 
[02:00:00]  Well, actually, it's kind of cool.  I, I do enjoy it.  Um, you have to have a stomach for it.  How do you enjoy it?  Yeah.  We barely enjoy what we do.  Well, I mean, the hours are kind of cool.  And, you know, I want you to get used to the smells.  It's interesting to see how a human body is, you know, what's inside it.  And I don't know, I guess I'm a ghoul.  Wow, you are.  Well, the obvious question, could you walk us through one of your, uh, better, better cleanups? 
[02:00:30]  Well, um, the, the thing about killing yourself is if you really care about other people, you're not going to blow your head off because that is really hard to clean up.  I mean, the fragments are everywhere and they're just, it's all over the wall and blood stains, everything.  It gets into carpets.  I mean, and the smell is insane depending on how long that person's been there.  You know, like imagine, I mean, as much as I love Lane Staley, how bad that was.  You know what I mean?  That, that was kind of a gruesome one. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, he's been there a while.  He's oiled in his own guts and whatnot and heat.  And you were talking about trains and we have to clean the bottoms of trains as well.  And trains are really tricky because there's so many, you know, nooks and crannies and the human body goes everywhere.  And it shells and fragments of the skull and whatnot.  It takes a long time and many of us have to get together as a team to clean a train.  So you've been under trains just scrubbing shit away and. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, yep.  Wow.  How bad does it smell?  Oh my God.  I can't even, you know, like if you go past something that's dead on the road.  Yeah.  Intensify that 10 times.  You're like the wolf.  What's the, what, this is a dumb question maybe, but what's the worst thing you could smell as a human being?  Um, I think it would be the bile and the things that come from the liver after it's sat there and corroded in the heat. 
[02:02:00]  That's got to be the worst.  I mean, gut smell and everything.  But it, the things that the body releases like, like bile is definitely one of the absolute worst.  I mean, think about the smell of your vomit and think about that rotted.  Ah.  Intensified with all the good stuff that comes out of our body.  Yeah, I want to know if there's an answer to that question maybe online though.  Worst thing you could smell as a human being.  It's got to be some kind of death thing like she's describing.  Oh yeah, that's, that's about it. 
[02:02:30]  And it pays incredibly well.  Oh, does it?  Oh yes.  Oh yeah.  Of course it does.  Yeah, that's the one job that people really don't, don't want, so.  And there's not a lot of women in it either, so it's, it's fun because, you know, I kid  around with the guys and stuff.  Ah, you're just one of the guys.  Yeah.  Let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet, gentlemen.  Yeah, that's really a sexy time to go sucking a dick too.  We're just seeing kind of a montage of the people that jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. 
[02:03:00]  It's, it's just fucking horrifying.  The guy lost his hat, poor old fella.  I love the guy that carefully went over the railing before he jumped.  It's weird, man.  Like he had to be really.  Didn't want to hurt himself.  He didn't want to hurt himself.  Here's the backwards guy.  That's the backwards guy that ended the documentary.  It's like a fucking three camera shoot.  And he doesn't even put his arms up at all.  Oh, that has to hurt.  That had to break his neck.  Look how much water, the, the, the, the splash is huge. 
[02:03:30]  The thing that's weird is, there's, it's human, like they climb over the rail and some of  them, like instead of just jumping up and out, they almost lower themselves and jump, like  they lower a foot and squat and then gingerly jump off.  Like you would jump off a diving board.  Or, or, or, or like you would jump out of a first floor window to try to, to, to lower  your, lessen your impact.  Yeah, right.  What is that about?  Silly.  That's just, that's just inside you trying to make you survive. 
[02:04:00]  All right, Andrea.  Andrea, anything else to add?  Smashed.  I guess not.  This lady's really mad.  We're promoting a bridge jumping.  Danielle in New York.  Yes, Danielle.  Danielle.  Jump off the damn bridge.  And now he's got, he's got 800,000 people dead stopped in fucking traffic.  People have lives they want to go to.  And you want to be Spider-Man, Superman, who, or matrix yourself on a black trench coat off 
[02:04:30]  a bridge.  You guys need to stop promoting bridge jumping.  It's the most selfish way.  Well, well, why do they have to, why do they have to stop the bridge traffic after someone  jumps, by the way?  Why?  For what reason?  Because they want to try and save this motherfucker.  If he wants to go, let him jump and let traffic pass.  But they got to close the lane.  Then they got to bring in the people to talk him down.  And then it's how many hours of this?  He's going to ask for fucking coffees and donuts before he decides to jump. 
[02:05:00]  He melts it.  And you know this.  You've lived through this a few times, huh?  I think the media doesn't report all the people trying to jump off bridges.  Nah.  I fucking missed flights because of these assholes.  So I guess the least selfish way is the Brad Delp.  The Brad Delp.  The note that, the closed door and the note that says, don't come in here.  You got the nice barbecue smell, so that's kind of pleasant in general.  Yeah, yeah, that's good.  That's good.  The cleanup's easy. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, and it's professionals that are doing it.  You just wrap him in the comforter and drag him out?  Yeah, that's all.  You don't even have to see him.  You know, because you don't want to see somebody all fucked up like that.  Fuck that.  Fuck that shit.  All right, you want to move on?  Or we got, like, a guy jumped from Caesars parking garage in AC.  Oh, I wonder what happened there.  A lady he's with in AA, shot herself in the face and lived.  That's never good.  You tell me what you want here.  A guy he works with hit a guy committing suicide in a truck before he hit ground. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Truck driver, someone jumped out in front of him.  You want one of those?  Yeah, that's selfish right there.  All right, let's say hi to Travis in Kentucky.  Travis.  Good morning, boys.  How you doing?  Hey, Mike.  About three months after I started driving, it was about 10 years ago, I was going down  a back road and there was another truck pulled over off to the side of the road.  So I kind of moved over a little bit and he darts out from the front of his truck and  I just ran him completely over and came to a stop and found out his wife was divorcing 
[02:06:30]  him.  So he decided to use my truck as a way to kill himself.  Oh, great.  It was a fucking mess.  Did it fuck you up?  Yeah, a little bit.  I'd been driving for about three months and said, screw it.  Do you see those eyes in the middle of the night when you're trying to go to sleep?  Yeah, just peering at you.  It's gone away now, but it was pretty fucked up when it happened.  I mean, it was a big, the guy actually fucked up the truck pretty good. 
[02:07:00]  He was about 300 pounds.  Jesus.  We didn't have one of those little cleanup crews.  I took the truck to the truck wash, got it washed off and took it to the body shop  and they found parts of him after they put the hood off.  This guy had to do his own cleanup, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you think about that.  There's no one going to clean your fucking car after someone jumps out in front of you.  Yeah, right.  Could you clean this?  What?  Could I have the executive wash, please?  Yeah, the people in the truck wash said it happens quite a bit, actually. 
[02:07:30]  They said, you know, I'm not the first one.  They've sprayed body parts out from underneath the truck.  You know what?  I'm just starting, after all these years, really learn this truck driving fucking culture.  We're talking about this.  Look at this.  One, two, three.  There's four more stories of people stepping in front of semis.  Yeah.  You're right.  This shit is happening.  It happens all the time.  I mean, we got off a ramp in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and we thought it was a deer at first, 
[02:08:00]  and then the police blocked it all off.  A woman got ran over by seven different trucks.  Well, it doesn't matter after the first.  Yeah, really.  Yeah.  There was nothing left.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  There was this little kid named Gage, and he ran out and it was tragic.  Yeah.  Very tragic.  Very tragic.  Jim in Illinois, Jim.  Little Gage.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Yeah, I had a young gal. 
[02:08:30]  I never figured out if she ran out in front of me or if she was laying down in the road  and stood up at like three o'clock in the morning.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Thank God I never saw her face.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Didn't get a look at that fucking, the big wide open eyes.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was a deer at first, but I saw her hands.  I thought they were antlers.  What was she, going, na, na, na, na, na?  Nah, she was dressed in really dark clothes.  Hands up? 
[02:09:00]  Na, na, na.  I'm doing it.  Yeah, I see.  Anthony has his thumbs by his head like bullwinkle ears.  That's not helping.  Antlers.  Trying to help.  That's not helping.  No.  No.  No.  It's making us uncomfortable.  What about Brian from San Diego?  A Padres fan there, Brian?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, fuck that.  Hey, fuck that.  F.A. Frileys is now officially a Padres fucking sports bar.  Spread the word.  All right.  I'll meet you. 
[02:09:30]  Too many customers?  You wanted to cut down on the...  Yeah, I wanted to thin out the herd a little bit.  What do you got there, Brian?  All right.  That's a pretty traumatic story, but before I moved to San Diego, I was living with my best  friend in Buffalo, and he actually killed himself with the Boston Method with the charcoal  grill.  Yeah.  And he locked me out of the house.  I was closing up the store.  I came home.  He locked me out of the house.  I had to crawl in a window.  And as soon as I crawled in, the entire house smelled like a fucking barbecue. 
[02:10:00]  And he had the door taped up and everything.  So it actually leaks out and destroys, like, the whole house.  After he got carted out of there, I had to fucking scrub everything.  There's soot everywhere.  And I cannot smell a barbecue now without being fucking traumatized.  Oh, so it's fucked you up.  It does fuck you up.  But the thing that's really, honestly, it's probably the best way to go. 
[02:10:30]  Because when I saw him, he was pretty peaceful.  He wasn't, like, in 500 different fucking pieces, like the truck store or anything like that.  Just kind of laying there.  Yeah.  That was kind of depressing.  I'm sorry.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Oh, jeez.  Kind of fucked him up a little bit.  Yeah.  We were going to move on.  But there's a train engineer on the phone.  Listen to this.  Choo-choo.  Learning something new.  Hey, good morning.  Sean in Idaho.  Hey, good morning.  Hold on one second. 
[02:11:00]  Hold on one second, sir.  We have to address the fact that Anthony, I don't know why, but when you said a train engineer,  he just went, choo-choo.  I wanted to let the listeners know, like, paint a picture so they could see a choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  You should know why, though.  So childish.  This is very uncomfortable for Anthony, so he's trying to keep it light.  Oh, okay.  He's trying to keep it light.  This is very uncomfortable to listen to. 
[02:11:30]  Okay.  Sean in Idaho.  Do you want to hear it again real quick?  Yeah.  Hold on, Sean.  Hold on.  Oh, jeez.  Kind of fucked him up a little bit.  Yeah.  We were going to move on, but there's a train engineer on the phone.  Listen to this.  Choo-choo.  I know.  I am an ass.  There was no reason for that.  Choo-choo.  Choo-choo. 
[02:12:00]  Please, one more time.  Please.  We were going to move on, but there's a train engineer on the phone.  Listen to this.  Choo-choo.  Such a sad little sound.  I didn't even put anything behind it.  Choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  What's wrong with me?  All right.  Sean, go ahead.  Oh, that helps.  Thank you.  Yeah.  They tell us before we even take the job that it's no if-and-for-plus you will kill somebody. 
[02:12:30]  It happens so often.  You hear this?  What?  They tell these engineers before they, you know, jump into the train for the first time that you will kill people on the job.  Yeah.  Not really.  And, you know, it's one thing when you kill a deer or something, but, man, when somebody's just out of nowhere, you're doing 65 down the rails.  And somebody just jumps out of the dark, and boom, and they just explode, you know?  And it's pretty tough. 
[02:13:00]  They give us psycho, you know, we talk to people afterwards and stuff, but, you know, it's, you know, some people deal with it.  It's part of the job, man, it's pretty tough, you know?  You just never know when something's going to just do it.  It's really selfish.  It kind of messed me up.  That choo-choo, though, is pretty funny.  What was your first one, though?  Like, what was the first one that happened to you?  Just 65 up here in southern Idaho, and just out there in the middle of the desert, and you're just cruising along. 
[02:13:30]  You're not thinking anything, and all of a sudden, I mean, our lights are pretty far out, so, you know, it's pretty pre-planned.  Was it a guy or a girl?  Do you remember?  It was a guy.  He just, they think he may have been drinking or something, but, boy, when you're, you don't know.  You're just cruising along, and.  And did you see him?  Like, did you get a good look at him before?  No, you're going, well, you're going 65, and he jumped out in front of you at the last second, because, you know, it's not like you can stop a mile-long train on the dime. 
[02:14:00]  You know, and all that weight coming at you, you just explode.  You know, like that one girl was saying, they have to scrub underneath the train and stuff, nooks and crannies, because there's nothing left.  You know?  I always thought, what would happen, I've always thought, like, I would hate to get, to stand in front of a train.  I would never jump in front of a train just in case I lived.  But the thing is, I would hate to get hit by the train and bumped forward and then crushed against the wall and live for a few minutes.  Oof, no, you want to explode, I guess. 
[02:14:30]  I don't think, I mean, if you've ever seen, like, YouTube clips where, I mean, semis get disintegrated, cars, you can just imagine what a human body is.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  Okay.  You just explode, yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, guys.  All right, Sean.  Thanks for bringing that to light, and hopefully some guys won't be so selfish and truck drivers and train guys, you know?  Nah, I think we just gave a lot of people some good ideas today.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's how it really works, if you think about it.  Thanks.  And then, finally, a guy jumped out of a truck while he was driving to kill himself. 
[02:15:00]  Why the fuck do that?  That's, ugh.  Mike.  Yeah.  How do you know this to be true?  Because I was driving the truck.  Oh, he was a passenger, I gather?  Yeah, one of our drivers had an accident.  He was too nervous to drive back, so they sent me down to pick him up.  And on the way back, he was all depressed because it was a third accident, so they were going to fire him.  And as we're going down the freeway, he unbuckles his feet out, dies out the passenger door. 
[02:15:30]  Killed him, huh?  No, and the worst part was he ended up in a coma, and then his sister tried to sue the company for millions.  Oh, shit.  But you saw this guy open the fucking door and jump.  Yeah, I was driving the truck.  He just popped his seatbelt off, opened the door, dived headfirst right out the truck.  And when I pulled over, he lost part of his head, and it was pretty gory.  Why don't we move on? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, why don't we do that?  I think we're going to talk about rainbows next.  Double rainbows, all the way.  All the way.  Steven Adler should be here.  Yeah.  I think we're going to step aside and go cry or something.  The book is so good, man.  What else you got in there?  Just about when he sued Guns N' Roses and how he got fucked for money.  I guess because so many of these guys party so heavily, it's harder for them to keep their finances in order.  But it's, man, rock guys have an amazing life. 
[02:16:30]  Not always in a good way, either.  It's this amazing bubble where you lose touch with everything business oriented.  And that's why you got to respect these musicians that keep a good business sense.  Because it seems like it's so fucking hard to do.  It seems like most of them are partying their asses off, getting laid, playing music, and somebody else is ripping them off.  Dude, I'm not saying I'm impossible to steal from.  I'm not.  But I sign every check.  I fucking go online. 
[02:17:00]  I look at my investment accounts.  I look at my account.  I write my...  I fucking keep an eye on all my money, man.  I'm terrified of just waking up and it's all gone.  Yeah.  I don't know that much of it.  But it's like, you know, what I've worked for, I don't want to take it from me.  No, I want balances every month.  I want, you know, the old balance sheet sent to me.  Choo-choo.  I know exactly what...  Choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  It's such a sad noise.  Choo-choo.  I'm an engineer.  Choo-choo.  Why?  I know what trains sound like. 
[02:17:30]  I know.  I felt compelled.  I don't know why.  Choo-choo.  I wanted to make a choo-choo.  Boo-boo.  Choo-choo.  The Moby and Anthony Show on the virus.  Mysterious XM.  Oh, yeah.  More Mel Gibson audio on the way.  He left eight voicemails.  Wow.  For that brud.  We're going to be playing all eight of the voicemails.  But first, we've got Steven Adler. 
[02:18:00]  Why wouldn't they bring him in?  He's just...  I know, right?  Hi, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, what's up, Steven?  Gentlemen.  How are you?  And Chip.  Chip's enough.  See you again, man.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Fucking Steven Adler.  It's been a while.  How are you?  Great.  You look good, brother.  Thank you so much.  You just kissed me?  Smell good, though.  Everybody gets a lot of ideas.  Looks like you're keeping your shit together.  Yes.  Right off the bat, I've got to say that.  He's doing good, brother.  Because, I mean, we were all very concerned after that celebrity rehab.  Like, what the fuck?  That was the best thing I ever did. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I have the greatest experience working with Dr. Jerome.  Are you a success story?  I'm his prodigy.  Are you his prodigy?  Because I think a lot of the people that end up doing celebrity rehab in Sober House,  fucking Chip's going to agree with me, go right back to doing their shit.  Well, most people do even regular rehab do that.  True.  Excuse me.  It's the hardest thing to do.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got 30 years of doing it.  Are we on?  Yeah, we're on.  Yeah.  That's what we're talking about. 
[02:19:00]  I don't want to repeat this problem.  We're so fucking casual with our radio show.  I have to tell people don't know if we're on the radio or not.  We're on the air.  But working with Dr. Jerome was really, really special.  And, you know, you only get what you put out is what you get out of it.  And I went in there going, I could either look like the biggest jack-off in the world.  Which you did.  Or I could look like the coolest motherfucker.  And I looked like the coolest motherfucker.  In the end, you did.  That's all that matters.  In the end, it turned out to be. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  You know, the train wreck in the beginning, but as long as the end of it, it works out.  It was great TV.  He actually is a sincere guy because sometimes it comes across like,  All right, he's a TV psychiatrist, so he's kind of.  No, he's real.  He's a really good guy.  He gives everybody that he wants to do it, he gives everybody the same opportunity.  Yeah.  Everybody gets the same chance, and it's what you do with it.  And I wanted to do something with it.  Actually, you know, Rodney King came out of it a winner, too.  I hear he's doing great. 
[02:20:00]  What is he doing now for money?  I don't know what he does for money.  But Dr. Drew says he's been sober this whole time.  That's good.  I mean, I relapsed like five, six times within the last two years, you know?  It's been two years since that show?  Yeah.  How long are you sober?  Five months right now.  And you're sober, like sober, sober.  Sober, sober?  No, nothing.  Chip?  He's the only one who smokes weed.  Chip?  I don't do that.  He's been great, you guys.  We're on a whirlwind tour right here with this new book out.  We have a single, so we're just hustling every day, hitting every radio station. 
[02:20:30]  We had a senior bro the other day, and now we're out.  Howard.  Oh.  And now we're out there hustling around.  Yeah, we're bros, all right.  Going around the country, just we want to make sure we don't leave any stones unturned.  I think we're bros with everybody that works on that show except for him, for some reason.  Well, he likes you guys.  Really?  Yeah, okay.  He does.  He said, tell you guys to say, hey, because he told me we're doing it in the morning.  I always said, tell those guys to say, actually, he said, tell those jack-offs.  Yeah, probably.  It's fine.  I think at this point, we don't even know why we don't like him. 
[02:21:00]  We've got to figure it all out.  It's all good.  Whatever.  The book is fucking phenomenal, man.  It really is.  I've been going through it.  I've been perusing this all morning, and it's written in a way that it's like, it's the  way you want to read a book.  It's got like little blurbs in it.  It's no long, boring bullshit.  It's like everything has something interesting in it, and it's like, I'm just like jotting down notes  and fucking loving it.  Well, you know, I worked with Lauren Spagniola on it, and I told him, I said, I want this  book to come out.  I'm just an everyday or any person who doesn't necessarily read books all the time, be able 
[02:21:30]  to pick it up and look at it and be able to understand everything.  I don't want it to be complicated, no big words.  Just get nice and simple.  Jimmy's saying it's a very easy read.  You're hitting people with stuff right off the bat.  It's not too wordy, and it's getting right to the point.  It's honest.  It's interesting.  And it's amazing how much I dislike a lot of lead singers, and not that that's your  intention, but the more I'm reading this, like fucking, I can't read about fucking Scott,  what's his name, Scott?  Wylan.  I can't read about any fucking lead singers that make the guy's way drive me nuts. 
[02:22:00]  So I'm reading this, and I'm just fucking hating Axl.  Yeah, no, but when you read a little bit more about him, it talks about in the book how  he actually, you know, most of the time would have no respect for me or the band, and a  lot of times he would have more respect for me than anything.  He would give me such love.  It's, you know, up and down.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Complicated relationship.  I mean, that's a way that it's going to kind of fucking almost have power over you, you 
[02:22:30]  know?  He's a powerful guy.  Treat you like that.  Mentally, yeah.  He's no dum-dum, that guy.  What was that?  He's no dum-dum.  What happened?  This drove, this with a percentage.  Like, you guys were 20%.  It was like, what, was there five of you?  Yeah.  Each got 20%.  Yeah.  But then Axl wanted more money, like a higher percentage, and you gave in, and no one,  what happened with that?  Well, no, I, because I thought it was fair, Axl, you know, the lyrics of the song are pretty  much, you know, the most important part is what you're always seeing around in your head 
[02:23:00]  is the words.  And he did extra, you know, I thought, you know, he deserved that.  He wrote most of the songs.  He wrote most of the songs.  He wanted to give me three and a half percent.  And I was like, no, no, no.  I said, I'll give you five percent of mine.  So, you know, you'll get 25, the other three monkeys will get 20, and I'll take 15.  And I thought that was fair.  And it was.  But out of the other band members, I just didn't like the fact that he got stuck with 15  and they didn't give in any.  I just felt bad for you, like annoyed for you.  Well, no, no. 
[02:23:30]  I did that out of, you know, respect for Axl.  Wow.  Damn.  I mean, I knew the record was going to be huge.  We knew it while we were in this recording studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, we were going and we'd play, you know, lay down one song, go in the listening  booth and listen to it.  And we'd just be looking at each other going, this is going to be the biggest record ever.  This is exactly what we want.  That's right up there.  So it's like I knew that at least 15 percent of millions is a million of sales is still a lot.  That's a good living. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Now that money, what happened to it?  Most of it got stolen, snorted, smoked, shot, drank.  But most of it got pretty much, you know, I was taken advantage of by accounts.  Right.  Oh, excuse me.  You didn't keep tabs on your cash, I guess.  Of course not.  What 22, 23, 4, 5-year-old does that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just signing checks, right?  They have power of attorney and you just sign checks.  Yeah.  You get checks for two, three, four hundred thousand dollars if you don't ask questions. 
[02:24:30]  You don't know where it's going.  Oh, man.  But also, you do think it's going to last forever.  Yeah.  And unless, if Appetite for Destruction wasn't to keep selling like it does, or in like the  movies, you know, that new movie, they play Paradise City.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, things like that, that's big money.  So you're still getting good cash off of it.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  That's good to know.  I'm very thankful.  Wow.  Very thankful.  And now you're watching your money, obviously.  Of course.  Of course.  You learned your lesson. 
[02:25:00]  Now I care.  You know, I want to go back to when you were 11, because we were talking about this before  you got in here.  What, I don't understand the mindset of a mom that would kick out an 11-year-old.  Well.  I understand a teenager and all that, but an 11-year-old, that's insane.  Well, my stepfather, my mother and stepfather, they had their own child, which was my little  brother, Jamie.  And it was like, I wasn't his.  And I was, you know, wild and crazy.  I was very hyperactive, you know, kid, so I was running around, and it was hard for 
[02:25:30]  them to handle.  And one night, I went to, I met a garage band, you know, a couple of older teenagers at this  garage, and it was the first time I beer bonked six old English 800s.  Holy shit.  At 11.  Yeah, at 11.  And they kind of walked, well, what kid, that's when, you know, you start, that's actually  when you start growing.  Right.  You know, that's when you start experiencing life.  And I remember, I sort of remember, they walked me back to my house on my bike, and they 
[02:26:00]  knocked on the door and ran.  And my mom opened the door, and I walked in, and she was having a Tupperware party with  all her lady friends.  And I just threw up in front of all of them.  And it passed out.  And that was kind of, we had enough.  And where did they send you?  To my grandmother's.  Okay, so at least.  Yeah, it wasn't bad.  And it all, it all, you know, worked out good, because a couple weeks after that, I met  Slash.  And we've had a, you know, not a great relationship.  So if you were never kicked out of your house, you probably would have met Slash? 
[02:26:30]  I would have never met Slash the whole, wow.  Isn't it weird how that shit works?  Isn't it weird how that shit works?  You know, it's crazy.  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  Huh.  It is weird.  Like, what seems so fucking horrible at the moment, you're led to be one of the biggest  bands in the world.  Yeah.  Bizarre.  So you, what was the, there's the stories, obviously, as you were growing up, and there  was the, obviously, it's a big piece, the Starwood.  On a sexual abuse?  Yeah, sure, man.  I mean, it's odd for you to admit that.  Well, you know, I had to, because I kept beating, there were so many things, and I didn't 
[02:27:00]  really realize that were inside of me that I kept stuffing down that kept me from, or  kept me beating myself up.  And I needed to get this stuff out, and working with Dr. Drew, he, you know, taught me, it  was like going to school to get your life back together.  Right.  And he, you know, he'd do paperwork, and he explained, and I learned from it that you've  got to get this stuff out.  And once I, you know, I thought if I said that I was sexually abused, you know, by an older 
[02:27:30]  teenager, an older man, when I was 12 years old, that I would feel worse.  But it's, after saying it, it was the opposite.  I felt so much better.  It was like, oh, my God, what a relief.  Right, right.  Yeah.  What happened?  They were, they were the owners of a club.  Were you going to the club?  I haven't read that part yet.  I used to live down the street from the Starwood, and it was off Santa Monica and Crescent Heights.  And I used to go, you know, hang out there when all the bands would come for soundcheck.  And then, you know, I just met all the people there. 
[02:28:00]  I was, I can't believe I was, you know, 12 years old.  You look at a 12-year-old now, I'm just a little kid.  Back in the 70s, and me and Slash did school every freaking day.  And we, nobody said nothing to us.  I mean, nobody said nothing.  I mean, nobody, you would think the school would call up our parents.  You know what I'm saying?  You know, your boys ain't coming to school.  They never come to, you know, to enroll.  And it's like, nobody did nothing.  Those were crazy times.  But they fed a 12-year-old Quaaludes. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, man, there was this club called Osco's Disco that me and Slash used to go to in Hollywood.  And we were, you know, 13, 14 years old, going to disco.  Like, disco, doing cocaine, and Quaaludes, and acid, and fucking.  It was a fuck.  Thank you, God.  It was a curse.  Wow.  I mean, we were with older people.  That's right.  And it was like, when I, like I was saying, I see kids that, you know, 11, 12, 15 years old.  You can't imagine now, right?  How many grown-ups? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  It was like, it seemed like we were grown-up kids.  Right.  But it's a sexual abuse.  These guys were feeding you drugs.  The first time it happened, or when it was started.  Well, it only happened in one time, but that's all it takes.  Did you know, did you know while it was happening, this was fucked up, or was it after you kind of came out of the hands?  It was after I came out of it.  You know, they, they, they, they drugged me.  I didn't, I mean, I was partying with them, but they gave me more of other stuff than I thought I was taking.  Okay.  And that got taken advantage of in heart. 
[02:29:30]  And, you know, it happens.  I'm not the only one.  And that's another thing.  I, you always think, you know, you're the only one.  And you realize it's more common.  And I realize I'm not the only one.  And did you actually carry that with you and kind of keep it a secret and feel bad about it or ashamed of it?  Of course.  Until I, you know, got it out of my system and said it out loud, I felt better.  Did you see those guys?  No.  After the fact?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, sometimes, you know, they would.  Did you want to kill them? 
[02:30:00]  No, I didn't, you know, it was, I don't remember it really, per se, you know, remember it exactly.  Right.  Because it was under the big influence.  Right.  Of drugs, so.  Wow.  So, as you were coming up, were those guys out of the business when the band was getting big?  Were they long gone?  Or were they still not?  Oh, I didn't really know those people.  I didn't know, know those people.  Yeah.  They would just come to the club every once in a while, too.  Mm-hmm.  It's funny about that.  That's the same place I met Danny Bonaduce.  So, I wonder if that was, maybe that was, you know, he's got that same problem, too. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, wow.  Danny, if you have that problem, get it out of your system.  Talk about it.  You'll feel better.  Trust me, brother.  You'll feel better.  He's got Danny some fucking Quaaludes.  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  I remember the first time I met Danny there at the store with.  I was, like, 12 years old, and I was on acid.  I walked into the office backstage, and Danny was at the table, snorting coke.  And I go, dude, Danny Partridge, oh, my God.  And I'm on acid, so it's all colorful. 
[02:31:00]  Like the boss.  Danny Partridge, I love you, man.  Holy shit.  It's funny how it's to be so casual.  It's like, yeah, I was 12.  I was on acid.  It's like, man, that's a long run, man.  That's a long run.  Fuck, that is a long time for taking drugs.  Yeah.  And a pretty young period of your life.  Jesus Christ.  When I talk to other, you know, teenagers, everybody, and even older people, everybody said that's  when they first started, you know, experimenting.  I mean, a little weed, you know.  Yeah, well, it started out with the weed. 
[02:31:30]  You know, go in and sneak a couple shots of your grandpa's whiskey.  Right.  But then to...  But then to...  But I was hanging out with an older crowd at a rock and roll club.  To do...  To start doing Blow, like, before you even become a teen...  Yeah, before you...  Is...  Wow.  It's just amazing.  That's just going to be a long, hard road.  And, you know, it was like, I lived off Crescent, or, um, Santa Monica, Fairfax, and Slash  lived off Santa Monica and Sweetshire.  So, when I would walk from my grandmother's house to his house, it was on Santa Monica. 
[02:32:00]  It was West Hollywood.  So, there's, you know, a lot of, you know, gay people, you know, on drugs themselves.  Yeah, with the...  Hollywood, you think, you hear it's crazy stories now.  It was crazy then.  They cleaned it up a little bit.  Great.  It was actually cleaned up.  It was a nutcase out there.  Yeah, it's like Times Square.  Kind of like a Times Square outside the windows.  How it used to be just a fucking zoo.  Yeah.  It was a circus out there, and now, you know, you can walk down there pretty much safe.  Yeah, no problem.  Santa Monica Boulevard still has a very lot of tall, very attractive ladies walking around 
[02:32:30]  in Santa Monica.  Yeah, there's a pretty six-foot-four girl.  With handlebar mustaches.  A very wide pack.  Yeah, they all look like Lemmy.  Very attractive.  I saw you.  I saw a picture of Axel.  He's got one of those handlebars, mustaches.  Rocking the handlebar, huh?  Yeah, he's getting that Freddie Mercury look.  When was the last time?  Oh, boy.  When was the last time you talked to him?  About three years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, in Las Vegas.  We, we, uh, he was playing there at the Hard Rock, and I wanted to, you know, see him 
[02:33:00]  and say hi.  So I came down to the show, and then his manager, Dell, saw me, because I, well, he saw me because  everybody that was watching the show, when I walked in the back, turned around and came  up to me.  And they had me signing stuff, and he said, dude, if you, I think if you, I don't want  to actually get pissed off, so I think you better leave.  So I left, and then I'm opening up the front door of my house, and the phone's ringing.  I pick it up, and it's Dell.  I'm so sorry. 
[02:33:30]  Axel wants to see you.  Come back.  Oh, shit.  So I went back, and we, we, we drank a $3,000 bottle of tequila, and stayed up and talked  at 6 in the morning.  Wow.  And we, we made amends with each other.  So now it's just, you know, I'm hoping that Axel will read my book and realize what a  special thing that the five of us, you know, had, and that we can always have.  Right.  Just because whatever happened in the past, it's the past, just like, you know, my life. 
[02:34:00]  Well, what, what happened?  Like, what broke up?  Management.  All I can tell you is management.  Management just broke up this band and broke up a good thing?  Yes.  They got greedy.  You said at one point, too, that the songwriting was happening when you were with, I think,  Slash and Duff and Axel and Izzy hadn't arrived yet, and you were feeling increasingly isolated  from the band, which is hard when it's fucking five guys.  Was it your paranoia and doing drugs, or were they actually isolating you from the creative  process?  No, no.  It wasn't the creative.  They isolated me from, not, it was after, like, right before, you know, I got kicked out 
[02:34:30]  of the band, is when, you know, it was usually me and Slash and Duff, we always hung  out together.  We partied together.  And Izzy was kind of, you know, he's like a gypsy, and Axel's off in his own world.  And then all of a sudden, it was like, Slash and Duff kind of started easing me, giving  me the old Spanish archer, you know, to get off to, you know, over here.  And so it was like, they'd be over here, and then I'll be all by myself.  Wow.  And they were your friends, and it was like, if you, did it make you think if my good 
[02:35:00]  friends are doing this, that I must be fucked up?  Well, unconsciously, I realized that because I had abandonment issues, it was because of  my mother, and then the same thing happened with the band, and I just went over the edge.  But now everyone else was doing drugs in the band when you got kicked out, so that's kind  of fucked up.  You got kicked out because you were doing...  I went overboard.  I don't get that to this point.  How did you go overboard?  Some people could handle drugs better. 
[02:35:30]  When you mean overboard, you just weren't performing anymore?  I wasn't performing properly, I wasn't the person that I started out in the business  being.  And the rest of the guys had no problem keeping up, even though they were doing their stuff?  Well, I don't know what they had.  They'd wake up to them every day.  All I know is I got the old Spanish archered.  But now...  But you know what?  For 20 years, I blamed them.  I blamed them.  I thought they let me down, but I've realized it wasn't them who let me down.  I let them down.  But no one slashed for so long. 
[02:36:00]  So, did he ever try to approach you and say, hey, you know, you're fucking up?  No.  How could he say that?  Yeah.  See, that's what's confusing.  But you knew him since, you know, you were kids.  I know.  I mean, you would think he'd be the one...  Drugs do, you know, bad things.  But that's the most confusing part of the story, because we've had Slash on a million  times.  We're friends with Slash.  And he openly admits all the crazy shit he was doing.  So, he has to be aware to see that he's doing worse shit.  That's why it's so fucked up.  When you're in that mental state, you don't know what you're doing. 
[02:36:30]  I didn't think, when I was doing heroin and stuff, I didn't think I looked that fucked up.  But when I saw that on the Celebrity Sober House, when I got high on the first day of shooting,  and then I got arrested, and the next morning I went back, and they had me watch it, and  I looked at myself, and I was like, holy crap, that I looked that...  That was terrible.  I didn't think I looked that bad, but then once I saw myself, I was like, oh, I don't 
[02:37:00]  ever want to look like that again.  Right.  That is the worst kind of, like, fucked up person, is when they don't think they're that  fucked up, and they are trash.  Yeah.  I think everybody has somebody in their life that they care about and love, that is doing  drugs or drinking too much like that.  They should film them, and let them see what they look like, because honestly, you don't  know.  Ozzy told a story about that, how he thought he was being charming at one of his kids' birthday  parties.  Charming.  And being like the life of the party, and Sharon filmed them, and he said it was horrifying 
[02:37:30]  to him.  All the kids were crying.  You know what I mean?  He was frightening, everybody.  Charming.  But he thought he was just being this fun dad.  The Prince of Darkness.  Charming.  He thought he was being charming.  Yeah, but you're a fun guy, but people tape you.  You're right there.  He probably heard them laughing.  Yeah.  He thought they were all laughing, and then he watches the video.  I'm sure he got naked and jumped in his pool, too.  I want to go back to Axel for a second.  What is his deal?  What is his deal?  He wants to, he has, I don't know. 
[02:38:00]  All I know is what I think is he has, like he's a loner, obviously, right?  You never see him out in public.  It's really hard to photograph the guy.  All I know is I miss Axel very much, and I would love more than anything for him to be  a part of my life again.  Right.  So all the resentment and stuff, you guys worked that out when you sat there and drank  that night?  Yeah.  This whole book, everything, this is the past, my 45 years right here.  And when I get home, I'm going to build a big fire, and I'm going to throw this book 
[02:38:30]  in the fire.  And then I'm going to just leave everything in the past, because I can't go back.  And I'm going to, in 15 years from now, we'll see if I can write another book.  Do you miss those guys as your friends?  I miss them as my friends, as my colleagues, as just somebody just to talk to.  Just to sit and have a cup of coffee with me.  You talk to most of the guys, right?  Well, I talk with Duff and Slash.  Duff's a cool guy.  He comes out a lot, too.  Duff's the coolest.  But Izzy's the coolest person.  Yeah, we've never met Izzy, I don't think. 
[02:39:00]  I've never met Izzy either.  Yeah.  Is he off on his own, or?  He's a gypsy.  It's the best way to be, right?  This guy knows how to live life.  Yeah.  To the fullest.  He has, like, dune buggies and motorcycles.  And him and his dog, they'll just get up one morning and say,  Ah, I'm going to Mexico and go dune buggy riding for a week.  That's great.  And he does it.  I'm going to Spain and go to, you know, do this.  Or ride my bike throughout, you know, Europe.  And he does it.  So you don't keep in touch?  I respect that. 
[02:39:30]  You don't keep in touch with him, but it's only because he's gone?  I can't find him, Izzy, please, if you're out there.  Anybody who knows Izzy, please tell him that I would love to say hello to him.  I would love to give him a hug more than anything.  Does he have a cell phone?  I don't know.  You don't know.  I think, I ask Slash all the time, please email him for me.  Tell him I miss him and love him.  But I hear nothing back.  How long has it been?  Two years.  You haven't seen him in two years?  Yeah.  It's weird, like, reading this book and there's so much craziness in it and so many fucking crazy moments. 
[02:40:00]  Do you feel kind of like, because I'm listening to you, like, reach out to these guys, like, you've come out of a haze and realize, like, fuck, man, time has passed and my friends are scattered now.  And it's almost like you come out of this fog and try to, like, reach back and grab for these people that are gone.  I mean, like I said, we have a very special thing.  And it's so hard for people in life, five people to get together and have something so special. 
[02:40:30]  I mean, how many musicians are out there?  How many bands are out there?  Millions.  Yeah.  But it's a rare few.  Because it's so difficult to get five people that just are so, you know, know what each other is going to do before each other is going to do it.  That's why me and Chip, he work out so great.  He goes, I know what he's going to play before I'm, you know, he's going to play and he knows what I'm going to play.  Right on.  And it's so hard to find.  A drummer and bass player is so important.  Yes, this is a riveting interview. 
[02:41:00]  You've heard the same shit how many times now?  Listen, I never get sick of it.  I'm sympathetic to Steven's plight.  I know what he's went through.  Izzy has come out.  Him and Duff came out and played with Steven and I on the 20th anniversary.  Slash came out that night, too.  And I know Izzy stays real busy and he still plays with Axl once in a while.  They go to South America and they'll do a couple songs every night.  And it takes, my grandfather used to always say, son, it takes time for all wounds to heal.  And I think it's healing right now.  And this book has really been the catalyst there. 
[02:41:30]  And I believe that Guns N' Roses will get back together again, you guys.  And one more run because there's this uprinks truck full of money out there.  There's a tremendous amount of money.  Yeah, you're right.  More than anything, gentlemen, really.  The band, they love the fans and the fans deserve it.  And it would have to be the original five.  Oh, it's going to be.  Okay, it wouldn't be.  It couldn't be any other.  It would have to be.  It will be.  It's important for me to do something with those guys again because I feel like I didn't finish what I started with them. 
[02:42:00]  How's your drumming these days?  My drumming.  Welcome to the show tonight.  He's better than ever now.  He's way better now than he was in Guns N' Roses.  I never took a lesson in my life before four months ago.  I decided to take a lesson.  I decided to take a lesson.  Who the fuck is?  Who's teaching?  Who's teaching Stephen how the drums?  Sammy Alejano.  Let's look at his resume.  What has he done with his drumming?  He's done a lot of stuff.  He's really great.  I mean, I want to get better.  I want to learn more. 
[02:42:30]  That's got to be intimidating.  Be better.  I've got to teach Stephen Adler how to drum.  Yeah, right.  What are you playing tonight?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  What is that?  The Bell House, right?  Yep.  Bell House, Brooklyn, tonight at 8 o'clock and tomorrow in Pittsburgh at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Very cool.  You guys play music?  You guys play music?  Yeah.  I was one of you to play every single.  Yeah, we absolutely do.  Yeah, definitely.  At the end of the interview.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Yeah, we're almost done.  Thanks.  You have a...  No problem.  Oh, fuck.  I forgot what I was going to ask.  Oh, can I ask you something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I totally forgot what I was going to ask.  How did they let you know you were being kicked out of the band? 
[02:43:00]  And obviously that made you feel horrible.  Oh, terrible.  Walk us through it a little bit.  I don't think I know the story.  They had me, they called me up, had me come down to the office, the manager, and they had  the lawyer, and they said that I was signing some contract saying that if I got high, which  it was ridiculous, that every time I got high, that I would have to pay $2,000.  Poof.  But really, what it was, was they were going to give me $2,000, take all my royalties away, 
[02:43:30]  take everything, my credits, everything away, here's $2,000, get the hell out, you know,  get the fuck out on the street, like I never existed, and that's it.  No.  Disgusting.  Isn't that disgusting?  So that's what the whole lawsuit thing was.  And I won the lawsuit because we went to court and they were such assholes.  You know, it was like really tough.  The jury just fell in love with me. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  And it was horrifying.  It was horrifying to be, you know, there and these guys are talking.  I mean, my lawyer would say to them, how many times have you OD'd?  And I slashed up to about 20.  You know, how could you, you know, say anything about Steven when you're doing the same thing?  Well, it was terrible.  Yeah, $2.5 million, right?  Was it $2.5 million?  And then I got on my 15% back.  Yeah, the back royalties, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, you should.  It's fair, man.  What's right is right.  That's crazy. 
[02:44:30]  Wasn't there an MTV thing, too?  There was a whole bunch of things.  Where you learned you were out at Guns N' Roses on MTV?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What was that story?  I was sitting at home watching MTV.  And then the commercial came on.  And Kurt Loder told you you were out?  Especially when Kurt Loder told me I was out of the band.  I was like, what?  Oh, damn.  I wouldn't take my calls or nothing.  Oh, shit.  I don't mean to laugh, dude.  Well, no, you can laugh about it now.  That's brutal.  That's all I need to laugh about it now. 
[02:45:00]  How are you with the fans now?  Because you saw the story in the book about going to see a bunch of bummed out fans in a room.  Because the band didn't do many meet and greets.  And then you hung out with them and talked to them for a while.  And it made them so happy.  And you kind of regretted that you guys hadn't done a little bit more of that.  Well, I try to do as much as that's possible.  Because I've had the opportunity to sit on my ass and watch TV for years on end.  And because of the fans. 
[02:45:30]  You know, I don't have to work.  If it wasn't for fans, all they want to do is see, say hello, sign something.  And I always do that.  Just have a little moment with you.  Just have a moment.  Take a picture.  And, you know, that's worth it to me.  Just to say, I love the fans.  I'm nothing.  No band that is successful is anything without the fans.  Do you regret being in kind of such a fog during that success period?  Not really being able to look back and think about what success you guys had?  Of course I do. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  There's so many experiences.  Have you dealt with that?  Yeah.  Everything I was able to get out of my system in this book.  Yeah, because that's got to be a tough thing to look back and go, fuck, I can't really look back.  I can't even look back.  There's just a few little moments here and there.  Do you remember the broads, hopefully?  The broads.  There were so many broads.  I thought you can't forget that.  All right, you weren't that fucked up there.  You remember the broads.  That has to be the ultimate for a guy in his 20s to be in the hugest band in the world. 
[02:46:30]  And you're just able to fuck like a maniac.  Plus, you're young, so you got that stamina.  You can do that shit.  But, yeah, definitely to be able to stand on the stairs on a bus and go, you, you, you, and you.  Oh, man.  You watch them fight with their friends, because you didn't pick their friends.  And then you can bring them on the bus, give them a beer.  That's a roadie's a fuck.  And anything goes.  The friends.  Exactly.  We're the friends.  That's right. 
[02:47:00]  He's right.  He knows.  That's the deal.  That is the deal.  So how many of you guys are sober now?  Duff, I think you're sober.  Oh, the whole band?  The whole band.  I think Slash said he's sober.  Slash's got almost six years.  Yeah, last time he was in, he was talking about that.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  He was my biggest influence.  Do you get financial advice from Duff, at least?  He's a financial whiz.  I would love for him to invest something for me, but I don't want to do that.  I just want him to be my friend.  How fucked up is a band that they all had to get clean?  Well, yeah, I'll spend that to do it. 
[02:47:30]  And never look back at booze or drugs again.  Do you get the itch, though?  Of course.  What do you do?  What do you do to push the itch down?  It just, it gets easier and I get stronger every day.  But do you do something else?  It takes time.  You know what I mean?  It just does something else.  It's not appealing to me.  We were at the, last night at the show, this, I broke my cymbal a couple of nights ago.  You know, it was all cracked.  So we sold it.  And we were selling it last night.  And some guy came up and said, how much for the cymbal? 
[02:48:00]  And Alex, my guitar player, goes, 100 bucks.  And he goes, well, I'll give you an eight ball for it.  And we go, no, we don't want that eight ball.  I want 100 bucks.  And once he's, you know, he showed us, you know, the thing of coke.  And I looked at it and I go, I cannot imagine getting in that mental state again.  I would blow my brains out.  I mean, you don't know how many days, I mean, days, literally looking out my sheet, you know,  the curtain out my window, thinking there's people in my trees and shit. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, coke makes you paranoid?  Oh, no, no, not at all.  I think I spent more time looking out my window and thinking there's people out there than  I actually did doing the drugs.  Jesus.  And if I would have put, if I could, if I would have put 1% of an effort in my life of getting  successful, as I did in getting those drugs and doing them, I would be the richest person  in the world.  Do you kind of like push away regret because you're like, you're like, you are alive. 
[02:49:00]  And like, you know what I mean?  You've been through enough experience that probably if life was fair, I would have had  you dead.  And it's like, well, you know what?  You fucking made it.  I made it.  I survived.  And I'm thankful.  And I'm going to take it for everything that's worth.  Now, there's no more taking anything for granted.  Oh, I want my next book in 15 years to be a happy story.  Well, I mean, this ends happy.  Well, your stats.  It ends with me in here.  Your stats are crazy.  Three attempted suicides.  Three.  28 drug overdoses.  Three more? 
[02:49:30]  Three?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, 28 drug overdoses.  I'll show you three right now.  One, two, three.  Okay.  That's just on my wrist.  Did you really want to kill yourself when you did the wrist thing?  I don't know if I really wanted to, but I just was so depressed.  And the drugs just made you.  When you do cocaine, let me tell you.  It brings voices.  You know, you always hear people say, you know, voices, blah, blah, blah.  You know, and then doctors would tell me, well, I'm bipolar.  No, I'm not bipolar.  I'm on cocaine. 
[02:50:00]  Okay?  I have voices going on in my head.  I would be walking down the street like, fuck you.  Shut up.  Leave me alone.  Just stop it.  You know, by myself.  And I'm just walking down the street.  And you know, people are walking down the street.  Who the hell is that crazy person?  Ah, that's a drone for Guns N' Roses.  Jesus.  I ain't a nutball.  Oh, fuck, man.  That is unbelievable.  And when you're fucked up like that, everybody and anybody will take advantage of you.  Yeah.  That's life.  Do you watch your finances better now? 
[02:50:30]  Like, have you learned a little bit more about how to handle your bank business and all your  stuff so you can at least keep an eye on it?  I didn't learn a little bit.  I learned a lot.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  I learned a lot.  Money is important.  I wish it wasn't, but it is.  Need that money.  He has Elton John's accountant.  Does he really?  Oh, yeah.  And they count to the penny because they pay me every week.  So.  To the penny.  To the penny.  Yeah.  I mean, it's good to kind of keep your eye on it.  It's like, all right.  At least I know.  I learned that from watching bands because bands, I think, are easier to fuck than comics 
[02:51:00]  because there's royalties involved and there's so much more.  There's other people.  It's coming from so many different places.  Right.  And especially like live shows.  There's like thousands, hundreds of thousands of cash.  A lot of cash.  And the merch.  And what's the merch split?  70, 30.  It's a fucking nightmare.  But these guys are just getting high.  But then again, I would probably take your life over mine.  I paid good attention to my finances, but you've been blown a lot more.  So I think I would.  I want to spend my money on horse anyway.  So it probably all comes out in the wash. 
[02:51:30]  Getting back to your mom, they gambled away a lot of your money?  Or is that just a rumor and you can't prove it?  Well, you know, a lot of people's parents who control their kids' money, who are entertainers  to get money, big amounts like that, get taken advantage of.  And my mother saw me just killing myself and figured, he's going to die anyways.  I'm going to enjoy this.  So she had fun with your money.  So she had fun with my money. 
[02:52:00]  And then I didn't die.  Is that true, Chip?  And then I didn't die.  I will say this.  Steven's one of the most generous gentlemen I've ever met.  And he's taking care of his brothers, his mom, everybody.  And he did it because he loves his family.  That's just like you and I would do the same thing.  Unfortunately, he was in a bad place at that time.  And maybe mom took the chips a little too far.  But it's not to me to say.  I don't want to be disrespectful to mom.  It's like that.  But he has been overly generous.  And I think it'll come back to him tenfold because of that.  How long do you guys know each other?  You guys seem to be very close.  Yeah.  His brother, Jamie, introduced us back in 1999, 2000. 
[02:52:30]  We had a conversation on the phone.  We both loved each other.  He says, why don't you get together and let's do a show in Vegas together.  I rehearsed one day, played the next day, and we've been together ever since.  What does Jamie do for a living?  He used to work with TKO, and now he's got a management company.  He's got his own management company.  No kidding.  Yeah, really good, too.  It was really good.  What was your mom's poison at the casinos?  The orange bandit.  Slot?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a lot.  Imagine millions of dollars in a slot of pulling.  She went through $10 to $20 million in slots? 
[02:53:00]  In a slot machine.  Well, then, plus on condos and houses and cars, furniture.  She went into the special slot room, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  How much you pull?  Well, once this casino starts sending you invitations, then it means they like you a  lot.  And they like you a lot because you're dishing and giving them a lot of money.  Well, you might want to tell Anthony that.  Yeah.  He's at that point.  They fly him around and stuff.  I like playing blackjack.  Obviously.  If they fly him out there. 
[02:53:30]  And get the treatment.  Yeah.  He gets the treatment big time.  They take care of him.  You're losing big.  That's what that is.  They love you.  Come on back.  They love the losers.  Come on back.  Also, the winners, though, because they know eventually you'll give it back.  Yeah.  Eventually, you're going to lose.  Even the losers get lucky sometimes.  Yeah.  We did it.  The last time we were in Vegas, a couple months back, we played there.  And we were walking to the show from the elevator at the Hard Rock, and there was this craps  table. 
[02:54:00]  And everybody around there was screaming, and going, yay, yay.  And they were, ride it, ride it.  And then we walked out five minutes later, and everybody was at the table.  I'm like, what happened there?  That's it.  They were all screaming, go, go, go.  And there's just sadness.  And you could just feel it in the room.  Yeah.  The chips always wind up going back into the dealer.  I think I sort of heard one guy go, I just won $10,000.  And he'd go, yay.  And 30 seconds later, he was, oh.  There goes, is there an ATM around here? 
[02:54:30]  Not the worst than going to the ATM.  Fuck.  Dude, we take my watch.  What's your relationship with your mom like now?  Wonderful.  Oh, you're really a great wife.  I told you.  I need everything.  I can't go on with my life unless I put everything in the past.  And I've talked with her.  We've gone to sessions, you know, doctor sessions.  I know, whatever it takes.  I got to learn from you, I guess.  Well, did you realize that you guys probably both had the same kind of demons in some way? 
[02:55:00]  Like, you know, she's a person, you're a person.  Yeah, she's a person, I'm a person.  I mean, my grandmother didn't treat her like my mother treated me when I was there.  I treated her the same way.  See, it goes like that, you know, from one generation to the next.  Reciprocal, right.  You know, I have the feelings that I have because my grandmother, she already raised all her kids.  I was her angel, okay?  I was her little blonde, blue-eyed angel.  And nobody was going to, you know, get anything over on me.  So, and my grandmother already took care of her kids. 
[02:55:30]  So, I was like, and her parents, I could do no wrong.  So, no discipline.  Yeah, so I'm lucky I had some positive influence in my life.  Sure.  To make me not like my mom.  Or maybe that's why I don't want to have kids.  Because look how terrible I was.  Look how nuts I made my family.  I don't want to have kids.  It scares you.  It scares you to be a father.  I brought you in this world.  I'll take you out.  And I'll make another one look just like you.  Are you guys doing a book signing? 
[02:56:00]  Marty, yes, we are.  Yeah?  You doing, are you working?  You doing a gig?  I did one yesterday, the day before.  It was really great.  A lot of people came out.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Today's Wednesday, so that means the book probably came out.  These are coming out on Tuesdays.  And that means Monday, the day before, would count for the list.  Yeah, HarperCollins just told us that Stephen's book is number 80.  And Amazon right now.  And moving up.  82.  Right on.  That'll move up, and a lot of those will be.  Well, where's the book signing?  Let's get the signing.  Yeah, the signing's what's going to put you on the list. 
[02:56:30]  I think it's at bookends.  Oh, let's get Marty, my man.  Oh, the famous bookends.  Yeah, you got to do the independents.  Where's the book signing, Marty?  Yeah, Bridgewood, New Jersey, bookends.  Is it bookends, Marty?  I'm a good guesser.  When, tonight?  Tonight.  What time?  That's Vanessa.  Hi, Vanessa.  Hi, Vanessa.  She wears her boots, doesn't she?  Oh, yeah.  Look at Vanessa.  Club her.  Anyone on the trigger right into the leer? 
[02:57:00]  Stephen will be at bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey today from noon until two.  Oh, two hours, yeah.  Oh, you guys got to get going then soon.  He's playing the Bell House tonight in Brooklyn.  Yeah, I know.  Looking forward to that.  Tomorrow he's playing Pittsburgh at the Hard Rock.  Tomorrow.  And he'll be signing at Eads Entertainment.  I think that's at five or six.  Are you attracted to Stephen?  Tremendously.  Yeah.  I can barely contain myself sitting here.  Do you work for the book company?  For It Books, yeah.  Oh, you're kidding.  Okay.  Right on.  Okay.  Yeah, so the signing today is in Ridgewood.  Thank you, Marty. 
[02:57:30]  Noon to two.  Well, only a two-hour signing.  So get there and get online.  Absolutely.  And get this signed.  Yeah, yeah.  Check out my website, AdlersAppetiteOnline.com.  Well, let's talk about the new band for a couple minutes before you guys get out of here, because  Chip's sitting there just bored.  No, I'm not bored.  It's just great interview.  You guys are terrific.  I've got a great team here.  Thank you.  Jim's terrific.  Thank you, Nick.  Check your rules.  So, talk about the band for a second, because you guys are playing the Bell House in Brooklyn.  Stephen set this tour up really great for us, because the book is the catalyst for this 
[02:58:00]  whole thing.  We're called Adlers Appetite.  We have our first single.  In this day and age, we're spending a couple hundred grand to make a record.  We just decided, we went and got Anthony Fox, who did Buck Sherry and Aerosmith, and we  did one song, and we put it now on iTunes and Rhapsody, and it's how we're going to do.  Every song, we're treating like a single.  And it's Alex Grassi, formerly from Quiet Riot, and Michael Thomas, and myself, and this  kid we found in Canada named Rick Stitch.  We've got Pipes' great look.  I think he's a star. 
[02:58:30]  And we go out every single night.  We're doing nothing but Appetite for Destruction.  Of course, all the songs that Stephen co-wrote with the band, but we threw a couple of our  own songs.  And every night, the single gets over like as good as our other songs.  People really gravitate to it.  I think we have something good here.  We've got a nice sound.  It's a culmination of everybody's style.  A little Guns N' Roses, maybe a little bit of a numbs and nuff.  And we all get along.  We're all having so much fun.  For now.  Let's be honest.  For now.  We've been together for quite a while, and we've all suffered.  I remember like three years ago, we were getting ready to go to South America. 
[02:59:00]  I couldn't get a hold of Stephen.  Record company flew me from Chicago to Los Angeles, or to Las Vegas.  I went to Stephen's house.  He wouldn't answer the door for anybody or talk on the phone to anyone, but he never  turned his back on me.  I ended up climbing up the stairs trying to get up there, and there he was standing with  a baseball bat ready to bash me in the head with him.  Who's trying to get in the house?  We went through tons, you know, and tours out where I'm left out in Germany, and I've  got to fly back home without him.  We went through a lot of stuff, so believe me, we're real brothers. 
[02:59:30]  Did you make that gig, by the way, that you flew in for, and they had to go to South  America?  Did that gig happen?  No.  Here's the exact words to me.  He was blown out of his mind.  I was vacuuming and cleaning up, doing everything I could in a state to keep off it.  And I said to him, I said, bro, we've got to go out here and do this.  He goes, I'm not going anywhere unless I get 20 grand.  So I called the agent.  I said, I need 20 grand.  He says, okay, meet me at the airport.  I'll give you the money there.  And then in the morning, he goes, he pushed the cymbal down.  I was sound asleep.  He pushed it down.  He goes, Chip, did you hear me? 
[03:00:00]  I'm not going.  And that was it.  We knew the tour was going to happen.  Two weeks later, he called.  He goes, I apologize.  Come on back here.  Let's start up again.  We've been together ever since.  I was smoking that crack pipe.  That was dandruff.  It's very bad.  What do you think when you miss a gig?  When you get high and you wake up and you've missed the gig?  It's so embarrassing.  It's shameful.  It's the worst thing.  You feel like you let not just yourself down, but the fans down and the band down. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  I'm sick of letting myself down and other people down.  It's been nice.  Everything's going so well.  But there's only one reason.  And I have to say, I am thankful for Dr. Drew for being a part of my life.  I've got to be honest.  You look great.  We interviewed you a few years back at XM, and I was a little suspicious.  It looks like he's trying, but I think you even admitted he was drinking a little wine or something.  And Jimmy was like, oh, okay.  He's got a ways to go, obviously. 
[03:01:00]  You look much different here today.  Yeah.  He was Otis Campbell, and it wasn't Ernest T. Bass.  So do you call people if you feel the urge?  Do you pick up the phone, or are you just doing it on your own, or do you kind of?  Oh, no.  I talk to people.  Oh, good.  You know, Slash is my biggest influence.  You know, because he's always been my best friend, and we've been so close.  And to see him having, you know, six years sober, and it's like, if he can do it, I can do it.  And I want, I need, I need, not just that I want, I need for Slash to be a part of my life. 
[03:01:30]  Right.  Because the last 20 years that he was a part of my life, it was the worst 20 years of my life.  And I had 45 years of life.  And the last two years since Dr. Drew hooked me and him back up, when me and Slash got together with Dr. Drew,  first he wanted me to do, he asked me if I wanted to do the sober rehab thing the season before.  And I says, I'm not ready.  I'm not done beating myself up yet. 
[03:02:00]  So next year he came around and asked me if I wanted to.  I says, yeah, I'm thinking, I'd like to do it, and I feel different now.  I don't like to try it, but I says, I don't think that I could do it to the best of my ability  and get the most out of it if I don't talk with Slash.  So he hooked up a meeting where me and Slash were in a room by ourselves.  No cameras or nothing.  And I had the opportunity to apologize to him.  Because I blamed him for the last 20 years of all my downfalls. 
[03:02:30]  Every bad thing that happened to me, you know, I blamed him.  And so I got to finally tell him, I'm sorry that I blamed you.  When it wasn't his fault, he didn't put the needle in my arm unless I asked him to.  I didn't.  Jesus.  How did he respond to that?  He said, honestly, that he was sorry, too, that he didn't stick up for me more.  And we started crying and we were hugging each other.  And it's just, he was a very special person to me.  We have so much, you know, history together. 
[03:03:00]  And we've done so much together.  And it's so important for him to be a part of my life.  And I'm so thankful he is.  Right on.  Last question.  Are you amazed at bands like The Stones?  Yes.  That can survive for so long with such massive names as Richards and Jagger and fucking Charlie Watts?  Well, that's all we ever, you know, back in the day.  We were going to be like, we want to be like The Stones.  We want to be like Aerosmith.  Being a huge fan, it's a real bummer.  It's a bummer that it ended, you know, so quickly.  Well, it doesn't have to be over. 
[03:03:30]  Axl, read my book.  I love you.  I miss you.  Duff is the Axl.  I love you.  I miss you, too.  Did you check out Chinese Democracy?  I think you should have called it War.  W-A-R.  W-A-R.  Oh, okay.  I mean, it's appropriate.  War, Axl.  Right, right.  He's at war with himself.  But, yeah, you shouldn't have called it Guns N' Roses.  I think it would have worked better for him.  Right. 
[03:04:00]  Good point.  Okay.  All right, let's play the new song, Adler's Appetite, Good to be Alive.  The book signing, let's get the plug in.  Today at 2 o'clock, it's noon to 2 at Ridgewood Bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey, which is  a great, there's a lot of room in there, too.  They don't just stand you outside like assholes.  They have you, like, looped down the stairs.  There's plenty of room.  And then tomorrow night, the gig is in the Bell House in Brooklyn.  Tonight, I'm sorry.  Tonight, Brooklyn, Bell House.  Yep.  Hard Rock in Pittsburgh, 10 o'clock tomorrow.  Go to Ticketmaster.com to see if there's anything left, or AdlersAppetite.com for his website. 
[03:04:30]  Right on.  Good seeing you, Steve.  Thank you guys so much, bro.  Great seeing you guys.  It really is.  And here's the latest single from these guys as we go to break.  Mill Gibson tapes next.  Turn it up.  New Mill Gibson tapes.  I mean, you know my dentist is working on that girl's teeth he knocked out.  Really?  What?  That's my dentist.  Ross Sheldon.  Dr. Ross Sheldon.  What is he saying?  Our teeth were really like that by Mill Gibson?  Are we getting the exclusive here? 
[03:05:00]  Oh, wow.  They really did come out.  No wonder she's so quiet on the phone.  She's like, I'm going to let this asshole sink himself.  Maybe that really is what happened.  It is.  Unbelievable.  All right, let's play this song for these guys, and we'll continue in a bit.  Thanks.  We'll be right back. 
[03:05:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:06:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:06:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:07:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[03:07:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Take it one more time  One more time 
[03:08:00]  One more time 
[03:08:30]  One more time 
[03:09:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show  On the Virus  Sirius XM  Jesus, Dan, you've got to warn us before you show us a picture of Snooki. 
[03:09:30]  She is disgusting.  She really is disgusting.  And she's got a bunt.  She's too young to have a bunt.  She has a big bunt.  She's got flap tits.  And one of those bathing suits that's supposed to hide the shit.  Yeah, yeah.  But then you know, oh wait, this girl's hiding some shit.  She's shaped like a Care Bear.  She's, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  She's a big bubbly thing.  She's just like...  That is one of the most unattractive swimsuits I've ever seen on anything.  It's like a grandma.  Like a grandma should be wearing it.  And her big bunt.  She is disgusting.  So fucking disgusting.  She really is disgusting.  She's fat in like the worst places.  Like she's fat in weird places.  Yeah, like her arms aren't fat.  Like her legs really aren't fat.  But like she's got this fat stomach and then like a fucking turkey neck. 
[03:10:30]  And then her hips are like fat.  They go right from her armpits straight down.  But Danny's on to something.  Her hips are fat, but they're like high fat.  Like you wouldn't consider her to have a big butt, but she has fat upper hips.  It starts at the bottom of a rib cage.  Her fat hips start right at the bottom of a rib cage.  And it gets fat.  She's round.  She's like really round.  I think Tyler Durden called her a Porky Little Ewok. 
[03:11:00]  Perfect.  Yeah, that's perfect.  Oh yeah, there it is.  Porky Little Ewok.  Is this on his site?  You get to it from his site?  This one's the superficial.  Oh, sorry.  I like promoting whatwithtylardurndu.com.  Well, he'll put the pictures up later.  All right, right on.  WTDD.com.  Oh, let me see that one.  For all your celebrity needs.  Ugh.  She's carrying a football. 
[03:11:30]  She's got a lot of pubic meat.  Wow, look at the big fucking cunt meat patch she's got under that.  You think that's just hair that she let go?  No, she probably waxes because, you know, she's one of these fucking guineas.  She's dumpy, man.  She is really dumpy.  I don't hate her, but she's a bit of a mess.  Disaster.  She has nice tits, though.  I would suck on big, fat tits.  No, no, no.  Her tits aren't nice.  They're big, though.  I wasn't sure because sometimes you get tricked when you see they're big.  They're big, but they're flattened out and they're like saggy. 
[03:12:00]  I'm not really sure.  They look saggy.  They look kind of weird to the side.  What a disaster area.  Stop to show these pictures.  I know.  I'm speechless.  Fucking no.  It's a radio show.  Once again, I want to thank Stephen Adler for stopping in, man.  He's a cool guy.  Yeah, that was cool, definitely.  Fucking cool guy.  We got Mel Gibson voicemails now.  Thank God.  Can't get enough.  On February 19th, between 1130 at night and three in the morning, he left eight voicemails. 
[03:12:30]  That's a weird, well, it's not a weird time.  That's a bad time, I should say.  Probably had a few belts.  Right.  I had a few in them.  I need to pick up this phone and make some calls.  Was looking at the phone.  Yeah, just staring at the phone.  Fucking cunt.  I ought to call.  You know what?  I ought to call her.  She deserves it.  And someone actually on Twitter said,  You guys get over the Mel Gibson tapes.  They're getting old.  How is something getting old when you've got new stuff coming out?  That's from Mel G in L.A. 
[03:13:00]  So listen to something else, you fucking douche.  But explain that to me.  Yeah.  That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  It's getting old.  It's not getting old if the story is still developing.  Yeah.  If we were still playing tape one ad nauseum, then you would have a point.  Don't listen.  But this is brand new material.  Voicemails from Mel Gibson.  Starts with this one.  It's a quick one.  The first one's really quick.  What the fuck was that about? 
[03:13:30]  He probably wasn't going to call her and he couldn't help himself.  I called.  He's a grown man.  It's Mel Gibson.  Well, true.  Fuck.  Sorry, man.  My blood sugar dropped, so I got to eat these Pop Tucks.  Oh, boy.  Who's the fatso?  Eric?  Yeah.  I thought I was going to go, hello.  Well, we're never going to get her back on anyway, so that's Brooke Hogan. 
[03:14:00]  Brooke is getting fat?  That's Brooke and her mom's gut.  Her mom is thinner than Brooke?  What's with her gut?  I love her legs off.  She's so sexy to me, Brooke Hogan.  Really?  I'd love to be wrapped up in her, like have her wrap those long, fat ostrich legs around  me, and then just pull my back in while I fuck her poorly.  I'd give her a terrible fuck.  What'd you?  I'd just come right in her.  Why is she getting fat? 
[03:14:30]  What happened to her music career?  That's got to be over officially, right?  Why?  She's good.  I don't know.  I don't keep up on the whereabouts of it.  The whereabouts of the family or whatever it's called?  Terrific TV.  And what's going on with the mom?  She's marrying the boyfriend, I think I heard.  Yeah, I guess they're engaged now.  Oh, Hulk has got to be just this close to going to the Golden Gate Bridge.  Does Hulk have money, though?  He did.  Less every day.  He's doing Rent-A-Center commercials.  He's pulling in.  He's got that Rent-A-Center money now.  Yep. 
[03:15:00]  Mel Gibson, voicemail number two.  Jesus.  Edith says not to work at your house.  If she does, I'll fire her.  I will not pay her for any hours at your house, okay?  She only works at my house, all right?  I don't want her at your house.  I'll fire her.  And you know I'll do it.  I fire people all the time.  And you'll have to find some other fucker.  But you'll have to pay for it yourself.  She works at my house.  She's my employee.  Just thought I'd mention that right now.  Now, if you want to call me back, I think we should discuss the terms of separation. 
[03:15:30]  Don't you?  Don't you think?  Yes?  Let's do it.  I won't smoke either just to fuck with you.  I want to really badly.  And you would love me to.  Because you want to destroy me and see me die.  And I know subconsciously that your whole fucking aim is to ruin me.  But I won't let you.  All right?  Selfish bitch.  All right.  Oh, wow. 
[03:16:00]  These tapes make you feel like you could be friends with Mel Gibson.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's just a guy going through some shit.  Hey, hang out.  Wow.  Wow, that smoking thing keeps coming up.  Oh, my God.  He's having a tough time.  There's so many problems.  She must have hated his smoking or something.  I wonder.  But I won't smoke.  Maybe she told him he'll go back.  You'll go back to it.  Yeah.  You know, shitty voice.  You'll go back because you're a weak.  You're a weak person.  I'm not weak.  You can't.  Voicemail number three. 
[03:16:30]  Whore.  Who doesn't love these?  He just calls up, says whore, and hangs up.  Well, there's a couple more seconds.  Oh, okay.  But you're almost right.  You're almost right.  No, we had to stop the thing.  Whore.  That's what he said right after.  Beep.  Whore.  Whore.  Let's answer the fucking phone. 
[03:17:00]  Sorry, bitch.  Whore.  Whore.  I love that.  Is he the best?  Tape number four.  Or voicemail four.  You were a sour-faced bitch today.  You think it was tricky to get that fucking tree in the hole of the scent and organize all  that shit?  You know how much fucking time and money went into that? 
[03:17:30]  Did you thank me?  Did you even have a fucking smile on your face?  Fuck no.  You were down there looking like a spoiled cunt.  You don't give a fuck, do you?  You really are a shallow bitch.  Everything about you stinks.  And I'm seeing it real loud and clear.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Everything about you stinks.  Everything about you stinks is a great line.  I want to lie.  Everything about you stinks.  I want to know more about the tree planting ceremony. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, what's this fucking tree?  He's got such a problem with her reaction to this fucking tree.  All right, Mel.  Enough with the fucking tree.  Some dumb local thing probably, right?  Yeah, yeah.  She wasn't very festive about it.  You know how hard it is to put a tree in a hole?  Voicemail number five.  Everything about you stinks.  It's great.  What's that?  What's this? 
[03:18:30]  What was it?  Iraq, what was it?  Why are you putting something old here?  Iraq?  Because you only played it one day, in case you wanted to play it again later.  What is it?  It's the Mel Gibson Voss remix.  Oh, well, it doesn't say that, does it?  It looked like volume three.  That's supposed to say Voss.  Oh, shit.  Oh, I think someone deserves an apology.  Fuck, no.  Iraq?  Blow me.  Apologize.  Here's voicemail.  Very good.  Voicemail number five. 
[03:19:00]  Just making sure you're awake if you're trying to sleep, because I'm awake.  And you deserve to be.  Yeah.  He can't slam that phone down hard enough.  He's waking her up because he's awake.  It says from 11.30 to 3, so what, every 20 minutes he can't help himself in a half hour?  Can't help himself.  He's trying to watch TV.  He keeps pausing the movie he's watching to call this cunt. 
[03:19:30]  Voicemail number six.  See, you can see I'm not available for use anymore.  You can see the wheels dried up, and you just take off.  You just leave.  You just take off, because I'm finished for you, right?  Because I can't give anymore, right?  To your fucking personal cause.  You.  I can't do it anymore.  So you're out of here.  Rat leaving the singing ship.  That's your M.O., isn't it, baby?  That's your M.O. 
[03:20:00]  I will believe that, because it seems to be the truth.  Wow, that sounds like a line out of one of his movies.  Probably a throwaway line.  That's your M.O., isn't it, baby?  Yeah.  This guy is more in the tree planting thing.  Kevin.  Yeah, man.  He planted.  He buried the placenta.  I can't spit out.  The placenta with the tree.  Oh.  What?  He says placenta?  Yes.  The baby's placenta, like, when they're a daughter? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, that's a thing they do.  Yes.  He said that, when y'all played it just a minute ago, he said the placenta and the tree.  What, what, what, what, uh, which one was that?  Fuck, we gotta go back.  Two?  Oh, is that the, the commercials Hulk Hogan's doing, it's for rent a placenta.  No, it isn't, Chip.  He says not to work at your house.  If she does, I'll fire her.  I will not pay her.  Where the fuck was it?  I think it was, like, two back.  The next part.  You were a sour-faced bitch today.  You think it was tricky to get that fucking tree and the hole and the placenta and organize 
[03:21:00]  all that shit?  You know how much fucking time and money went into that?  Did you thank me?  Did you even have a fucking smile on your face?  Fuck, no.  You were down there looking like a spoiled cunt.  You don't give a fuck, do you?  You really are a shallow bitch.  Everything about you stinks.  And I'm seeing it real loud and clear.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah. 
[03:21:30]  Why would it cost a lot of money?  It seems like it would be something you're doing your property, a little hole, a little  tree, a little placenta.  Everything is money with Mel.  It's, it's, he doesn't, if it costs five bucks, he doesn't want it spent on her.  Thank you, sir.  We didn't pick up on that.  Yeah, thank you.  All right, no problem, guys.  Later.  All right, what do you want?  Did I play voicemail six?  I don't know.  See, you can see I'm not available for use anymore.  You can see the world's dried up and you just take off. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Let's go to seven.  Have I justified the title mean yet?  I think so.  Okay, I'll stop being mean now.  I'll stop being mean because that's mean.  You call me mean, you'll get mean.  You call me something I'm not, you'll get it in spades.  Just remember that and I don't give a fuck whether you ever call me again or not.  Well, you kind of do.  You kind of do. 
[03:22:30]  We're up to seven voicemails within a three, four hour period.  You kind of care.  And number eight, this is a long voicemail, so I think he finally gets it all out here.  Those are all just little teases.  The final voicemail.  Maybe this is an apology for his language earlier.  Oh, you like to think.  February 19th of this year, this went down.  This to me.  Fucking disloyal is a fucking weak.  A fucking blind.  A fucking thankless. 
[03:23:00]  Such a fucking slut.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Don't ever sleep again.  Don't sleep as long as I don't sleep.  Don't sleep.  Fucking get sick.  Fucking get sick.  I hope you blow your nose.  Fucking get sick.  Yeah.  He doesn't know what to say.  He's so mad at her.  He's just so angry, but he doesn't know what to say to her. 
[03:23:30]  Fucking get sick.  Fucking get sick.  I hope you don't sleep.  I hope you have a summer cold.  Oh, he's the greatest.  He's fantastic.  Some great new insults.  I don't sleep.  Don't sleep.  Fucking get sick.  Fuck me up.  You have fucked me up. 
[03:24:00]  You have fucked me up.  You fucked me up.  Did nothing but help you.  And you fucked and shat on me.  Shat on me.  Like a low-life slut.  Which is now what I've convinced you are.  Fuck, I'm angry at you.  For the wasted fucking time.  I'm angry at you.  For the waste of my fucking time. 
[03:24:30]  Fuck you.  You fucking ordinary cunt.  You fucking ordinary cunt.  God, he has the greatest insults.  A lot of people have felt this way, though.  Oh, God.  Our relationship ends.  You're like, what a fucking waste of time that was.  He's able to voice it, though.  Very well.  Yeah.  Are we supposed to be outraged?  Like, obviously, we're not.  At her.  But, I mean, is the public supposed to be outraged  because he's saying stuff that a lot of people have thought?  I don't think so. 
[03:25:00]  You fucking ordinary cunt.  You're just fucking ordinary.  And that goes with a talent, too.  It's ordinary.  It's not extraordinary.  It's pretty fucking common.  You know what sucks about that?  You know he was all in at one point.  Yes, he was.  You know he's staring at that pussy and going,  you know what?  Yeah, I think you are very talented.  You're very talented.  Wow.  Oh, and now the truth is coming out.  That's got to hurt her. 
[03:25:30]  I'll back whatever you need.  Right.  He was all in.  Because this is going to.  No, you have a gift.  Just had blinders on.  Oh, yeah.  I think at one point he really believed that she had talent.  Raging hard on.  Right.  And fucking blinders.  You're right.  She sucked a recording studio out of him.  Yes.  Oh, that's a very good point.  Holy shit.  Yeah, let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  Yeah.  Dude, how old is Mel Gibson that he still has a phone that you can slam down in the cradle? 
[03:26:00]  I mean, what fucking year is he?  I've been hearing the slam down.  You're right.  He likes to be able to slam his phone down.  He's got the old school fucking phone.  He probably bought one.  Well, if he's got anger issues, you want to make sure that you hang up a phone call properly.  How many phones he's probably broken?  He said he's fired a lot of people, so he's probably been on the phone and smashed it down.  It just comes apart in his hands.  Very good, brother.  Thanks.  He's the old black bell telephone. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Dial.  With a long cord.  Yeah.  Probably strangles himself to try to calm himself down.  Clint, Ohio.  Yeah, I was wondering how Mel gets away with this.  I'm going through a divorce right now.  If I called my ex-wife up and said, hey, you dirty cunt, they would call the cops on me.  I'd get arrested for harassment or something.  Well, obviously, he's not getting away with anything.  He's in a world of trouble here.  Is the mainstream media even talking about this, though?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:27:00]  Because I've noticed a bunch of other shit.  I don't know.  I just hear you guys talking about it.  It's a gossipy shit, but I haven't, like, when a new tape comes out, I don't see Fox.  They're putting the beeps in and all?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  They might be getting tired of it because there's so much material to go through.  They don't have enough time to dedicate to this like we do.  Yeah, I don't know.  No, he's in fucking trouble.  I think, what, law enforcement is looking into it, right?  Yeah.  And obviously, it's not going to help his case with this girl.  They were never married, were they?  Or were they?  No, no. 
[03:27:30]  They weren't married?  But California has their palimony and all that shit, so he's in deep shit.  They don't ever get married.  They're celebrities.  You know, they do whatever.  Right.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  This guy's right.  Rich in Ohio.  Rich.  No one's rich in Ohio.  What, Rich?  Boo!  Go ahead, Rich.  Anthony's off his game this morning.  I heard Mel say she's going to get in spades. 
[03:28:00]  There's a couple of missions back there.  No bell?  No bell.  Oh, yeah.  Tired?  Thinking of leaving?  I shouldn't.  Leaving for the day?  I am a little sleepy today.  You're not going to get out of this fucking city with Obama here.  They have to shut down everything just so he can go over and see the view broads.  Where is he?  It doesn't matter.  They closed down everything.  Yeah.  I think he's in Jersey today.  I don't think it'll be that bad.  They're saying he's taping the view, Danny.  Today.  He's taping it today?  Yes, he is.  He might tape it a little later.  Maybe he taped it already and went over to Jersey. 
[03:28:30]  You might be right.  I'll be sidewalking it.  Watch me.  All right.  The end of voicemail number eight.  It's ordinary.  It's not extraordinary.  It's pretty fucking common.  I'd like to see you play a concert sometime.  You make fucking mistakes all over with live performance.  You can't do it.  So touring is out of the question for you.  Fuck, man.  This is probably what drove her to radio online.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She doesn't want to hear this.  Right here she said, you know what?  Fuck you. 
[03:29:00]  This is her button that he's pushing now.  And you know he's right.  Oh, absolutely.  You know she's...  Well, we heard her music.  I actually liked her music.  Oh, come on.  It was good.  Got a deal?  Doing a movie with her?  Yeah, what's going on?  I see you play a concert sometime.  You make fucking mistakes all over with live performance.  You can't do it.  So touring is out of the question for you.  You'll fuck it up.  I haven't seen you not fuck up yet live. 
[03:29:30]  I haven't seen you not fuck it up yet.  He won't leave it alone.  It's flawless.  Do you understand?  You have to be fucking flawless.  You don't know how to do that.  You ain't in that league.  So give it up.  Do what you're good at.  Whatever the fuck that is.  That's great.  I was waiting for the answer.  Yeah, yeah.  And he didn't disappoint.  I thought he was going to go with the sucking cock. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, like sucking cock.  What did he say at the end?  He goes, you didn't hear that?  I missed the last word.  Oh, hold on.  It's classic.  I thought he was going to fucking do some hack, you know, sucking cock thing.  Do what you're good at.  Whatever the fuck that is.  Oh.  I know what that is.  Deception.  Oh, because I know what that is.  Deception.  Oh, he just thought it.  Okay.  Yeah.  I thought a hump after that is.  Oh, fantastic. 
[03:30:30]  It really is.  Love the mail.  Love the mail.  Those are the voicemails from February 19th that just hit.  To have that much anger for this long a period of time that these tapes were made?  Well, I don't know.  Could this all have been in a week?  Even a week.  What are they saying on Radar Online?  If this was six hours, it's too long to be that angry.  I mean, they're stretching out by just releasing a little every day.  I mean, was this one day?  Was this one weekend?  Was this one week?  Yeah.  This probably was the course of a week or something. 
[03:31:00]  Right.  Well, Radar says he left 30 phone calls in 24 hours.  Oh, wow.  Are these all from that period?  Yes.  Hey, Todd.  What did you want to say again?  Yes, they are.  Sorry.  That was the phone screen.  Todd wanted to say something.  Yeah.  What did Todd want to say?  What does stupid Todd want?  Yeah, fuck you.  Can we find out what Todd...  Hopefully, directions to the Golden Gate...  Todd's online for you.  You can ask him.  This is Todd.  Todd, what the fuck do you want?  Yeah, what do you want, Todd?  Hey, isn't it illegal to record someone on telephone without their knowledge? 
[03:31:30]  Thank God we got Todd's call.  Well, not in certain states.  Only if you're doing a radio show.  Hang on.  On that last tape you guys got yesterday, you hear a beep at the beginning and a beep at the end.  Oh, yeah.  She pre-planned all this.  Yeah, but he has no knowledge of it.  She never even said to him on any of them recordings that he was being recorded.  Thank God we got to Todd's call, by the way.  Yeah, we understand, Counselor.  Thank God we got to Todd's call.  Thank you.  Why am I trying to make anything out of that one? 
[03:32:00]  Exactly.  Todd's asking us for advice.  He's not what he's doing.  Yeah, really, Todd?  I don't fucking know.  Go fucking read a law book.  Exactly.  Colton Ero and Cade Fear.  Yeah, really?  Really?  Leave us alone.  Sorry.  D-Boy working on the Sandy Cain.  Working on it.  Yeah, what's that fucking bum doing?  Working on it.  Wow.  That's how we end the show today.  Fuck.  Hey, do we have the interview of the guy that survived the jump?  Nice.  Jesus, C-Rock.  What?  Your name should be Barry Lumpkin. 
[03:32:30]  Why?  I don't know.  I can't help myself.  Can I talk about our dinner?  Uh-oh.  If you want to.  I was invited to a birthday dinner for...  No, I can't.  What?  Whose birthday was it?  Come on.  Whose birthday was it?  Iraq?  Come on.  Do your birthday?  Do it.  Do it.  You want to, like, go with this, or are you going to be...  Whose birthday?  No, I'll go with it.  We didn't get invited.  It was Angela's birthday, a little shindig, and a steak joint.  When was that? 
[03:33:00]  Friday.  That must have been fun.  You were out of town.  We were the only civilians there.  How was it, Ant?  I didn't go.  Oh, you didn't want to go?  I didn't know about him.  He wouldn't go, anyway.  Iraq, you didn't invite Ant?  No, Anthony was not invited.  Why?  Because I actually didn't do the formal invite.  Yeah, you were invited, but I wasn't doing the inviting.  It was family.  It was family.  We were the only civilians there.  It was all family, and for some reason, us.  I don't know why.  It was weird, because I'm thinking, oh, there's going to be other people here. 
[03:33:30]  No one was invited from the show but Ope?  Yes.  Make a mental note?  Add it to all the other mental notes.  All right, so what happened?  There was a birthday?  We're at a steak joint, and the menu comes out.  It's the Capitol Grill, and I don't know why they're fucking doing this at a steak joint,  but they list the calories of every appetizer, every fucking entree, the size.  They have to legally.  Yeah, now they have to. 
[03:34:00]  If it's a chain place.  What?  Capitol Grill is technically a chain.  I know they have a lot, but when I think chain restaurants, I'm thinking Popeyes and shit.  Morton's does it.  So they have to do that now.  Legally.  That's one thing I love about Bloomberg.  I'm glad we brought this up.  Yeah.  So now we're all looking at this menu, horrified, going, well, fuck, I'm not ordering this,  this, and this.  But the only person that wasn't horrified was good old E-Rock.  Wow, what E-Rock.  I enjoyed a nice wedge salad.  Thank you.  That wedge salad.  We've all had the dumb wedge salad where it's the iceberg lettuce to cut it in like 
[03:34:30]  a third, maybe, and they throw a little what on it?  Russian dressing.  Russian dressing, a little bacon.  No, it was a blue cheese dressing.  Blue cheese dressing.  With some bacon chopped up on it.  I was shocked.  How many calories do you think that was?  Do you remember how many it was?  Because I forgot.  I would guess.  Give me a real guess.  Because we've all had it thinking.  It's an entire wedge of salad.  It's a big chunk.  You know.  You've seen it.  It's like a quarter wedge of a head of lettuce.  With the dressing.  I'm going to guess 500 calories.  No.  No.  And you know the blue cheese is a little bad.  So when you're eating that, you're like, all right, but you know what? 
[03:35:00]  I'm just going to eat this fucking thing.  Over 1,000?  It was 1,100 calories.  1,100 fucking calories.  E-Rock was all in.  Everyone else was like, well, I guess I'll have a couple shrimp.  That doesn't look too bad.  And he was all fucking in.  I had the shrimp too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had 1,100 calories with that alone.  I liked it.  And then some of the steaks were like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  The ribeyes are bad.  Ribeyes are bad.  Some of the ones that were seasoned and whatnot were pretty high, but like the sirloin and  the filet mignon were under 1,000 calories. 
[03:35:30]  They were like 500, 600 calories.  Yeah, the filet wasn't bad.  The filet was like 500.  Filet mignon and Morton's, like the smaller ones are like fucking 400 calories.  I didn't know they were listing calories on the menus in these joints too.  It's not bad.  390 on some of them, like a smaller one?  There were so many items on this menu, over 1,000, and you would have never thought it  was 1,000 fucking calories for this stuff.  What'd you have?  I had the filet mignon.  Okay.  So that was 500.  So now you're up to 1,600 calories.  With pure horseradish.  The shrimp was another 400.  That's 2,000 calories.  Shrimp's low, I think, in calories.  Probably high in mercury. 
[03:36:00]  But I think it's low.  Isn't that great?  You have to say that.  High in mercury, low in calories.  Big decision there.  I eat a lot of crab cocktail.  Without the sauces, the hollandaise sauces kill you.  It's like 70 or 80 calories.  It's not that much, but it's the fucking sauces that you would put on it, which you shouldn't.  Lemon and cocktail sauce.  That's great.  Cocktail sauce.  Good on.  I love cocktail sauce.  Cock.  Who needs the tail sauce?  When you say cock, I'll say tail. 
[03:36:30]  I had a piece of the birthday cake that was given out.  What kind of cake was it?  Strawberry.  It was awesome.  Sorry, you're up.  Somebody sitting to my left had two pieces.  Who was that, Barry?  Oh, I had two.  I had two.  How am I sitting to your left?  Oh, left at the dinner.  Yeah.  What happened?  Barry.  I like his new name.  He's Barry Lumpkin.  Barry Lumpkin. 
[03:37:00]  Anyway, were we doing the suicide interview?  Yeah.  We'll do it right after the break.  Right after we finish?  All right.  So after we finish the live show, we still have more O&A.  And it's going to be the guy that survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge from the documentary  Bridge that we talked about years ago.  His name is Kevin.  And the director, Eric Steele, in studio with him.  Is it good?  Did you go over it again?  Yeah.  It's not bad.  All right.  So we'll do that for everybody because we referenced it today.  All right.  But first, you want to do the Rich Voss one and then we get the Sandy Cain one? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  I want to hear the Sandy Cain one.  Definitely.  All right.  First, though, Rich Voss talking to Mel Gibson.  And then hot off the presses from D-Boy, Mel talks to Sandy Cain.  There goes Barry.  Jesus, Jim.  Barry Lumpkin.  Oh, you're there.  I just want you to know that everything about you was an offense to me and offended me and  pissed me off.  Really?  You know, you fickle cunt.  See, here's the thing with me.  I don't care.  You offend me on every fucking level.  Yeah, well, honestly, honestly. 
[03:38:00]  You offend me on every fucking level.  I despise you.  Okay, listen to me.  You've proven yourself to me.  You can't hack.  No, no.  You're a fucking fake.  You're a fucking sham.  Oh, yeah, really?  You fucking glum cunt.  What I'm saying is.  You ingrate, bitch.  What I'm saying is.  The game's over.  He's a fucking.  Okay?  And that's it.  Really?  For real?  I hope you fucking don't sleep.  I hope you fucking waste.  Yeah, but you know what the problem with that is?  Fucking ingrate.  Holy fuck. 
[03:38:30]  You know.  You fucking faggot!  Shut your mouth, you fucking idiot.  And I'm the idiot.  Oh, I hope you're fucking.  I hope you piss puss.  Bitch.  Not a real uplifting morning here.  You know what I'm saying?  Damn, is that good?  That's really good.  Also breaking right now, CokeLogic on Instant Feedback.  The Passion of Popeye.  We asked for the animation.

[03:39:30]  Anthony, Mel Gibson, and Sandy Cain, the remix from D-Boy.  Hot off the presses.  Sandy called up earlier today, a little angry.  Left some messages.  You want to just leave with this?  Yeah, we can do that.  Why don't we just leave with this?  We need to fit in the thing.  The other stuff.  Can I plug Atlanta?  I keep forgetting to do that.  Improv, right?  Tomorrow?  No.  Punchline.  Tomorrow night.  Sorry.  Punchline.  Friday, Saturday.  A week later is Tampa Improv, but finally returning to Atlanta.  Friday and Saturday.  And Thursday.  And Thursday.  Thursday. 
[03:40:00]  Tomorrow night?  Tomorrow night.  I do the show on our flight.  You're crazy.  Why?  You work really hard.  I like to work.  Have to.  Very cool.  Go see Jimmy in Atlanta Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at the Punchline.  Please.  We leave you with this today.  Sandy Cain and Mel Gibson from D-Boy.  My fucking hat, which I need to work, is gone.  All right.  You know I need that to work, to make a living.  How dare you?  You're blaming me right now.  You don't care about anyone but yourself, and your fucking stupid fucking failed career. 
[03:40:30]  You know better than the naked cowboy, and you were.  Shit!  How dare you lie like that?  Dishonest, fucking gold-tanky cunt.  Now I'm sure you whore.  You know, I did it over backwards for you.  You fucking glum cunt.  You know, for you stupid makeup artist.  Shut up.  You threw away my eyelashes.  I had a good day today, buy new eyelashes.  You're a fucking sham.  And I don't have my fucking hat.  I am going to the police. 
[03:41:00]  What?  And I am filing, I'm going to the police department and filing a police report that you robbed  my hat.  You're a dishonest cunt.  What are you hoping to accomplish with that?  What, are you going to pay me back?  How dare you act like such a bitch?  I am filing a police report that you robbed my hat.  Hmm, fuck you.  I don't involve the police in anything because I stand up for myself.  You, you weak cunt.  You call a fucking cop. 
[03:41:30]  If it wasn't robbed, you would have the courtesy to call me and say, Sandy, you forgot your  hat up here.  I know how much it means to you and your business as the naked cowgirl.  I should have woke you up and said, fucking blow me, bitch.  I should have fucking woken you up and said, blow me.  You would have liked that better, yeah?  Thank you for your friendship.  Call me, fucking cunt, whore.  That's all you're good for.  That's about all you're fucking good at.  You there?  Believe me, I'm going to the police about this.  I am going, I'm going to do a charge, a harassment against you guys. 
[03:42:00]  For what?  For me being drunk and disorderly?  For hitting you?  For what?  I'm very friendly with the cops in New York, by the way.  And they like me.  They treat me with respect.  Not like you.  You don't have any fucking friends except me.  Never mind.  What the fuck were you going to say?  I'm telling you, don't ever fucking call me again or I'll kill you.  I'm threatening you.  I'll put you in a fucking rose gun, you cunt. 
[03:42:30]  You understand that?  Because I'm capable of it.  You understand that?  I swear to God, I will take a gun and fucking kill you.  Fuck you.  And you can rot unless you crawl back, suck my cock, and say you're sorry in that order.  Do you understand me?  Asshole fat, fuck you.  Eat shit. </pre>
