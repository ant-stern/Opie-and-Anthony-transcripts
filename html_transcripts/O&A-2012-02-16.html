<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a discussion about the hosts' perceived repetitive content, a perceived lack of "vagina"-related segments compared to the past (including a nostalgic, detailed reminiscence of past segments featuring women and their vaginas), and the frustrating technical difficulties with their online QuickPlay stream, punctuated with frequent expletives.  This was followed by an in-depth analysis of Jeremy Lin's sudden basketball stardom, speculation on his future, and the commercial opportunities presented by his success, including the surprising popularity of Christian rapper Lecrae due to Lin's endorsement.  They also criticized New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's decision to lower flags for Whitney Houston, a decision further criticized by a caller, RJ, a New Jersey police officer, who expressed outrage at Christie's perceived lack of recognition for fallen officers. The criticism extended to Nancy Grace's reporting on Houston's death.  The hosts also engaged in a detailed and humorous, albeit often offensive, discussion of outdated commercials, specifically a Calgon commercial featuring an Asian stereotype and a Whisk commercial focusing on "Ring Around the Collar," dissecting the actors and their delivery.  The show also mentioned Andrew Lincoln from *The Walking Dead* as an upcoming guest.


The next segment started with continued complaints about the persistent technical issues with the QuickPlay app affecting multiple stations, followed by a discussion of MMA fighter Joe Lozito, who was attacked and stabbed after subduing a multiple murderer, Makes Him Gelman. The hosts provided graphic details of Lozito's injuries and Gelman's conviction, expressing strong negative opinions of Gelman and their belief in inadequate prison system protections for dangerous inmates.  This transitioned into complaints about broken light bulbs in Opie's house, followed by Opie's disdain for the Shorty Awards and their perceived voting irregularities, declaring he wouldn't attend even if he won.  This led to a discussion about their social media management frustrations across various platforms.  A significant portion focused on the outrage over Chris Brown's Grammy performance following his assault on Rihanna, using graphic descriptions from the police report.  They criticized the lenient treatment Brown received and the contradictory responses from his fans, particularly women.  A listener's call, misunderstanding the gravity of Brown's actions, further fueled their anger.  Floyd Mayweather's controversial comments regarding Jeremy Lin's success, attributing the hype to Lin's race, were also briefly discussed, alongside an analysis of the factors behind Lin's rise to fame.  A caller called Jimmy arrogant, concluding this segment.


The subsequent segment began with a continuation of the Chris Brown discussion and further speculation on whether Jeremy Lin's NBA success stemmed solely from skill or partly from his ethnicity. This transitioned into a lengthy and vulgar discussion about chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, with callers, including two doctors, offering varying perspectives on the validity of these conditions.  The hosts' discussion was laced with offensive language and crude humor.  They also covered a story about a teen disqualified from a sticker design contest due to his design being mistaken for gang symbols and discussed a Bruce Springsteen ticket giveaway contest. Again, Andrew Lincoln's upcoming appearance was mentioned.  The overall tone remained irreverent and vulgar, focusing on controversial topics.


The final segment began with a caller's trivia question about Bruce Springsteen's wives' appearances in music videos, leading to a humorous, often vulgar, guessing game with frequent contributor Roland.  They correctly identified the 38 Special video "Caught Up in You."  This led into the aforementioned Bruce Springsteen ticket giveaway contest, marked by caller difficulties with the hosts' unusual rules and off-color remarks.  The discussion then shifted to *The Walking Dead*, starting with hypothetical zombie apocalypse scenarios and weapon choices.  This devolved into increasingly silly and vulgar tangents about the hosts' personal lives and perceptions of zombies.  Finally, Andrew Lincoln, the actor portraying Rick Grimes, joined the show.  The interview covered various aspects of *The Walking Dead*, including its graphic content, special effects, character development, and Lincoln's personal filming experiences, including an anecdote about filming a scene in French despite limited fluency. The interview concluded with promotional plugs for Lincoln's show and Jimmy Norton's stand-up performances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  We just did this.  Didn't we just do this?  We just did this, Sam.  We just did this.  I have a very vivid recollection of just doing this.  It's in my head like I had just done it.  I don't want to confuse our fine, faithful audience.  Me and you have been doing this 17 years, right?  Ah.  And I still enjoy it.  Sometimes you might wonder if I do.  No, I really enjoy doing radio. 
[00:00:30]  But I've never felt like we just did this as much as I do lately.  I know.  And I explained it to Anthony.  It's because we don't have, you know, girls sticking things in their vagina day anymore.  That really kind of broke things up, doesn't it?  Like everyone has their job, right?  And within your job, there are days where you break shit up.  So it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing every day.  Something a little different.  Yeah.  And ours was, every once in a while, we had girls come in here, and they would just stick 
[00:01:00]  things in their vaginas.  Remember the girl that smoked out of her vagina?  How could you forget?  Girl that threw eggs out of her vagina into a blind guy's basket.  Remember the girl that just licked other girls' vaginas?  Girls' vaginas.  Girl that stuck a cell phone up her vagina.  Remember that girl?  Bottle rocket out of her vagina.  Remember that one?  A vagina was like Third Mike on our show back then.  We had vaginas as Third Mike.  It broke things up, though.  Yes. 
[00:01:30]  Instead, now we've got to, like, goof on society again.  Society.  We've got to goof on the news.  We've got to goof on pop culture.  We've got to goof on politics.  We've got to goof on each other.  On ourselves, yeah.  But there used to be a time where we broke it up with some shit.  Yeah, we don't have much vagina in here anymore.  No, we don't.  We used to have a lot of vagina.  No, we don't.  But, Sam, we just did this.  I want to go on record and say we just did this.  You did.  But it's your job.  Wasn't I just saying good morning? 
[00:02:00]  That was yesterday.  I think I was just saying it.  I thought he and I walked by the guy.  That's what I think of this morning is you going, good morning.  Good morning.  I didn't think of him saying it.  I had my headphones on.  I can just hear you going, good morning.  Good morning.  When you have your headphones on, he's still doing it to you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I saw his lips.  Because there's no connection.  Like, he did it to me today, and I'm like, I'm not even looking at you.  I got good morning, good morning, and then I got two welcome aboards.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  No, you're making it up.  I never heard welcome aboards.  You're making it up.  I was one welcome aboards short of a full house.  You're making it up, I think.  Welcome aboard. 
[00:02:30]  Welcome aboard.  He says it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But I'm starting to do the impression of him to him now.  Because I get off the elevator, I see him, and I go, good morning.  And he goes, good morning.  He gave me two good mornings, and I looked at him like, do you know we're talking about you yet?  You got a pair of good mornings.  But he has no idea we're talking about him.  No, no, he doesn't listen to us.  Why would he?  There's fucking, we would be the last person on this entire platform, if he had to listen to Satellite Radio, that he would tune into.  Why, because he's black?  Well, that's part of the reason. 
[00:03:00]  Is this a black thing?  We probably don't have a very large crossover audience, as far as...  We got some blacks.  Oh, we have some.  We got some blacks.  We have some.  I think it's below the population level, though.  And unfortunately, after the death of Patrice O'Neal, that number drastically dropped.  Yes, by 100%.  He was really helping us in that area.  He really was helping the demo.  He was bringing the blacks.  Yeah.  So, just because the whole world is talking about him, Jeremy Lin, the Knicks won again last night. 
[00:03:30]  I'm going to talk about the Knicks until they lose, okay?  Is that all right?  Wow.  And then we can go back to just not talking about basketball as much.  Lin Sanity.  Lin Sanity continues.  Lin's incredible.  It's a Lin-Lin situation.  The Knicks won their seventh game in a row.  They're now 500.  They were a shitty team this year.  Yeah.  Even though they had Carmelo Anthony and Stoudemire.  They were a shitty team.  Adeline Troll.  They were seven games under 500.  Then they put Jeremy Lin as the starting point guard.  They have now won seven in a row.  Yeah.  And Jeremy Lin had another really good game. 
[00:04:00]  This time, a lot of assists.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it was 13 assists, which is his career high.  Ooh.  And the Knicks won again, and he got to sit and hang out on the bench for most of the fourth quarter,  if not all of the fourth quarter.  I gave up on the game.  And I want to thank Kevin from Connecticut for giving me an illegal feed, and I have no  problem saying it.  Whoa!  I am now watching Knicks basketball online, and I don't give a fuck if they come after me.  Fuck these people.  Yeah.  Fuck Time Warner, and fuck MSG. 
[00:04:30]  These greedy motherfuckers.  Well, I think, actually, it's probably the NBA that would have a problem with it.  And fuck the NBA, then.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  I just hope you didn't give me a link where my computer now has some fucking fatal disease.  Uh-oh.  There were pop-ups all over the place while I was watching this game, but it was worth it.  How was the quality?  Was it high HD?  The quality, it was like old school TV. 
[00:05:00]  Would it have static?  Almost.  Horizontal hold would go every so often?  Almost.  That old school?  It was good enough to watch.  Yeah?  Yes, absolutely.  There should be a horizontal hold fuck-up app.  Yeah.  Where you just hit it, and everything you're looking at gets horizontal lines that go up  just to, you know, a little nostalgia.  Kind of like Instagram?  Work on that.  I'm a genius.  Well, Instagram.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like Instagram for your whole...  All of a sudden, people like taking photographs that look like they came from the 60s.  That look old.  So why don't we watch our TV like it came from the early 70s? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, so when you put something on your TV, you could have static, you could have ghosting.  Yeah.  Where you get that thing, like, all of a sudden, Channel 8 would show up.  I forgot ghosting.  On it.  Remember, ghosting, you'd be like, what is it?  Is that Gilligan's Island?  I'm watching 60 Minutes.  What the fuck caused that?  It was like a intrusion of the channel that was next to the channel you were watching.  Gotcha.  Yeah, it would kind of ooze in.  Did you watch Linsanity or not?  No, I just watched the highlights. 
[00:06:00]  It's easier that way.  But I did see the ovation when they brought him out, and the crowd went utter bullshit for him.  Do you realize this guy went from a nobody to on the cover of Sports Illustrated  in one fucking week?  One week.  And we're still trying to make it.  What?  17 years later, we're still trying to make it.  This guy did it in one week.  Jesus.  In one week, he did it.  Did you read the headline that it may spur MSG and Time Warner to talk now?  Of course, because people are losing their minds.  Like, look, we finally want to watch the Knicks. 
[00:06:30]  You guys got to figure this shit out.  Yeah.  You know, but of course, that'll mean more, you know, our cable bills will go up.  Of course.  Yeah.  They'll figure it out that way.  Yeah.  And Travis was telling me, I didn't know this, that the NBA is scrambling.  They want him part of the All-Star game festivities.  Just some type of, yeah, addition.  He's not famous now.  He can't play in it.  He's not popular.  They want to get him involved in the festivities.  Right.  I think they'll have him interviewing people or something. 
[00:07:00]  There's something on the mic, baby.  I don't know what they're going to do, but, you know.  And people are going, Travis was asking, he's like, is this guy the real deal?  Yeah, he is.  He's got the skills.  I don't understand why he came out of nowhere.  I don't understand that.  But this is six games, right?  Seven in a row.  No, I mean, he's played in all seven of those victories.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he's played seven games.  As a starter.  And he's the shit after seven games.  I think he's played a little bit before this.  I don't even know.  I think he played for, was it Golden State, I think, or somebody? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  A little bit.  The Warriors.  Yeah.  Warriors.  But this kid is absolutely the real deal.  You could tell by his basketball skills.  Yes.  What if he just completely loses it, like, the next seven games?  I would be really surprised.  He's going to have a dud, obviously.  But I'd be very surprised if this is one of those weird flash-in-the-pan things.  Yeah.  Yeah, just how he drives toward the hoop and knows how to dish off to open man.  Lynn's appointment. 
[00:08:00]  Now, what will the headline be?  Lynn trouble.  You see all the Asians in the stands.  Asians are now, like, loving basketball.  All of a sudden, Asians love basketball.  Yeah.  And now they're going to yell and scream.  But in general, they don't love basketball when, like, a Mao, Mao, Mao, Mao, Mao, Mao.  What was his name?  Ming.  Ming.  Yeah, Ming came around.  And then, yeah, a lot more Asians started watching.  But last night, I think it was the Knicks or MSG or...  It couldn't have been MSG, right? 
[00:08:30]  They put a little viewing party together in Chinatown.  Really?  And they were showing this bar.  If you have a team, you want an Asian star on your team.  Oh, man.  They fucking come out and there's a whole market there.  You bring a whole country in.  A whole country.  Because the poor Asians really don't have that many sports stars.  They can latch on to and relate to.  But a lot of sports teams will get one international player because they understand how much money that brings into the organization. 
[00:09:00]  I forgot.  When we were in Boston, who was it?  There was a guy up in Boston.  And I need some help.  Asian guy.  I don't know.  Was it...  Oh, fuck.  Someone's got to help me out.  But it brought in, like, a whole ethnic group.  Oh.  And, you know.  Yeah.  And that brings in the key-ish.  I think they...  Yeah.  I think they realized that...  There was...  Probably got to be a bitch, though, to find.  The best is, last night, they're just showing the crowd.  Because the game was a blowout, so they had to kind of make it interesting. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And there was an Asian woman with a cutout of Cinderella, so she could put her head in it.  And her side said, uh, Lind...  Linderella?  Oh, the Lin thing is really getting old.  Yeah.  It's, uh...  Linderella?  Linderella.  And they kept showing her.  And she just would...  She was watching the game with her face through this cutout.  Daily News on the front has Lin Wynn's situation. 
[00:10:00]  Lin Wynn's situation.  And on the back, it's Roll Lin Along.  Oh, can they...  His name is Lin.  We get it.  I know.  They just got to love it.  And, uh, what...  Does the post...  Did the post do anything?  Hmm.  Press Happy Lin...  No.  They have Dish Upon a...  Dish Upon a Star.  Dish Upon a Star.  When you dish upon...  I don't get it.  I have a feeling we have a Mark Fidrich situation.  Yeah?  Remember Mark Fidrich?  He came out of nowhere and all of a sudden just took baseball by... 
[00:10:30]  Storm.  Well, because then I think he had a...  Feel in love.  Oh, feel in love.  Feel in love.  Feel in love.  That's in, uh...  And then Fidrich had that horrible injury and he was done.  He had like a...  How great was Fidrich?  For one season or two seasons?  He would yell at the fucking ball and the rosin.  He would pat the mound.  He was an OCD idiot.  Yeah.  And then he fucking...  Then he fucking dies under his tractor.  What the hell?  Under his garbage truck.  Oh, garbage truck.  Jesus.  Oh, garbage truck.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Wow.  In the middle of Massachusetts somewhere.  Mark the bird.  Mark the bird Fidrich.  That's what I'm worried about because I...  I don't have to say I think.  The kid absolutely has skills.  This isn't a fluke.  Yeah.  Now I'm more worried about some ridiculous knee injury that just fucks everything up.  Why can't we go with ancient Chinese secrets?  Why are people too scared to go there?  It used to be a commercial.  I think that's racist.  Why is it racist?  My husband.  Some hot shot.  Remember that? 
[00:11:30]  That's what she said after...  Can we find that, Sam?  See, what happened was somebody came in and was like, how do you get the shirt so clean?  And the Asian guy behind the counter would go like, ancient Chinese secret.  And then the person would be like, oh, ho.  And then the wife looks from behind the cleaner counter and she goes, my...  In total, like, not Asian voice, my husband.  Some hot shot.  Because he didn't have the accent.  He put it on because he knew people wanted to see that.  Right.  And also, she went with some ancient Chinese secret, huh? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So women have been beating up guys in commercials for a long time.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because you're selling it to a woman.  Is that it?  We always thought it was a new phenomenon.  But I guess this has always been a thing.  Calgon, right.  So why can't we use ancient Chinese secret for Jeremy Lin?  Because it kind of is a thing that came out of nowhere.  This is old.  That no one knew about.  This is old school commercials where they could do things like that.  And he gets rid of lid around the collar.  Oh.  Let's hear the commercial.  Sam, this is a commercial from the 80s when me and Aunt were growing up as child of the 80s. 
[00:12:30]  I was a child of the 80s.  Children of the 80s, because it's both of us.  Yeah.  I was.  Let's do the math.  How do you get shirts so clean, Mr. Lee?  Ancient Chinese secret.  My husband, Thumb Hotshot.  Here's his ancient Chinese secret.  Calgon.  All right.  Calgon's two water softeners.  Can you pause this?  All right.  I got to pause this whole thing.  How the fuck do you know this shit?  Oh, my God.  We didn't discuss that we were going here.  No, I haven't seen the commercial in so many years. 
[00:13:00]  But you know the exact line from a commercial from fucking, it could be 40 years ago.  I watched so much fucking television growing up.  I've seen this commercial 8,000 times when it was aired.  And I just remember everything from television.  I just, I remember Ancient Chinese Secret.  I don't, I didn't remember it was for Calgon until I saw it on YouTube here.  And I went, oh yeah, Calgon.  But I certainly wouldn't have remembered her part in this.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  I don't know either.  It's just, it's beyond me.  But that's the thing I, I retained. 
[00:13:30]  That's what I can retain.  I can't fucking remember people's names, fucking where I left my keys, shit like that.  But, boy, commercials and TV shows, I am all in.  You know what?  All in.  Yo.  If your brain was wired differently, you could have been working for NASA or something.  I know, right?  With my high school dropout.  But instead, you just know dumb commercials from 40 years ago.  So let me correct what you said.  If you weren't an asshole, you could work for NASA.  Exactly. 
[00:14:00]  You know what?  You make more money doing this.  That's the sad part.  Yeah.  See, it kind of worked out.  That's the sad part.  This kind of pop culture, commercials, TV show thing is, you know, a big part of what  we do on this radio show.  So, I guess it worked out.  You wouldn't have a hot chick if you worked for NASA.  No.  Oh, he knows so much math.  Oh, what happened here?  Who cares?  All right, hit it.  Wash water so detergents clean better.  In hardest water, Calgon helps detergents get laundry up to 30% cleaner.  But it'll go back to the other thing in a second here. 
[00:14:30]  We need more Calgon.  Ancient Chinese secret, huh?  See, I knew that part.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Detergents get laundry up to 30% cleaner.  But I forgot about the wife.  Yeah, the wife is completely westernized.  Why is that racist?  It's not.  Because he put on this stereotypical Asian thing.  But he's doing it.  So, if he does it, we should be able to do it.  But he's completely American.  That's my logic.  He didn't have that accent.  So, who cares?  He's just goofing.  Why?  What's the goof? 
[00:15:00]  Mr. Cohen, he's a very nice man.  He live on Park Avenue.  Wouldn't it be great when she came in with the Calgon?  Well, we need more Calgon if you went, you fucking cunt!  The customer's still here!  Yeah, bolts are in the face.  Stop cutting my balls off during my impression.  Boy, Calgon sells.  Why do you think they come here?  Would fucking drop.  You like driving the Mercedes, do you?  Well, keep the Calgon box in the back.  Fucking blabbermouth California whore.  I don't care why that's racist. 
[00:15:30]  I'll never get that.  I don't either.  If you've got an Asian guy that realizes that you can do an Asian accent, so that means  that that is a real thing, but if a white guy does it, all of a sudden it's racist and  you should be fired.  I'll never understand that.  You're not supposed to do impressions of Asian people.  I don't know why.  If you're doing an impression of an Asian person that actually sounds like that, then  you're just doing an impression of them.  Right.  Why the fuck is it racist?  It went from you're just doing an impression of the individual to, no, it's racist. 
[00:16:00]  Now it's racist.  But I don't understand who decided that all of a sudden.  Yeah.  Because you're right.  When we were growing up, you just did an impression of something that was different  than what you're used to.  Boy, you are absolutely right, Hopi.  We should just do a whole show talking like that.  Oh, that would be good.  Is there another Calgon commercial?  Because I want to call him the ancient Chinese secret.  Because this Lin guy was a secret the whole fucking time.  Ancient Chinese secret, huh?  That's the same one.  I think there was only that one. 
[00:16:30]  Really?  With her with that pan face.  It says commercial.  It was a commercial I hated and I could never find it again was the redhead who went,  Isn't this great?  It was for Ring Around the Collar.  It was a Whisk commercial and he was going, Isn't this great?  It was a redhead.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  We can find it today.  Whisk.  Oh, that's right.  We're not going to be able to find it because Sam is on the fucking computer.  I'm going to spell Whisk with the H.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  He thins. 
[00:17:00]  Ring Around the Collar.  Ring Around the Collar.  Those dirty rings.  You try scrubbing them.  You try scrubbing them out.  Scrubbing them out.  And you can still come out with Ring Around the Collar.  Now try Whisk.  Whisk out cleans any other laundry product because it sinks in and starts to clean before you start to wash.  Gets even permanent press collars.  Permanent press?  You won't hear Ring Around the Collar.  Can we talk about this for a second?  And it'll lead to a bigger discussion. 
[00:17:30]  These companies came up with stuff no one gave a shit about.  To sell more product.  Yeah, yeah.  Who ever cared if you had a little Ring Around the Collar?  No one ever saw it.  And how about when we finally started showering on a daily basis?  Who was getting Ring Around the Collar?  Or fucking businessmen that would shower once every Saturday?  I don't know.  So their sweaty, dirty fucking necks got their shirts all filthy?  But you never noticed it.  No one would ever notice you had Ring Around the Collar.  But Whisk decided, well, if we go with this idea, we could sell more of this Whisk shit. 
[00:18:00]  Dandruff was also a big thing.  Yeah.  I can't get that dandruff.  Dandruff is gross, though.  And it was like, oh, oh, head and shoulders commercials.  You know what?  People have dandruff.  Yeah.  But we just don't give a shit about it anymore.  That was made up by a shampoo company as well.  You ever see someone who has flakes all over their suit jacket?  It's awful.  It was usually like a greasy old math teacher.  You know what?  Like he'd lean over to see what the fuck you're doing, touch your dick, and he's got like,  oh, and he's got like flakes all over him. 
[00:18:30]  But you didn't give a fuck if he had that because you wouldn't talk to him anyway.  No.  So he touched your dick?  No.  Lean over.  I wanted him to, but he never would.  Flow chart?  I don't know.  Everything leads to a touching?  Yes.  Well, when someone spits out, touch your dick.  Oh.  Is that the redhead?  Is that it?  This might be the redhead, Jimmy.  My own kitchen.  My own bedroom.  And your very own ring around the collar.  Ring around the collar.  Oh, him.  For a tough stain like this, you need whisk.  But ice and powders aren't good enough. 
[00:19:00]  Whisk does a better job.  That brawn overbearing mother.  And when Whisk gets out, ring around the collar.  Remember her?  She was a whole wash, Jimmy.  No more surprise visits.  And no more ring around the collar.  Whisk gets ring around the collar.  From the very beginning, I think he's the line.  Oh, I remember that, though.  My own kitchen.  My own bedroom.  The commercial doesn't show that.  All right, he says, isn't this great?  I think he said, isn't this great?  He was so fat.  I wanted to cut his throat.  That was from 84?  Yeah, I remember that when I was growing up.  This Norman Bates couple over here, the overbearing mother making sure his fucking collars. 
[00:19:30]  I'm sure she scrubs the shit stains out of his undies, too.  Oh, we got to use Whisk on your shit stains.  Maybe that's what they were getting at, but they weren't allowed to say shit stains.  Oh, ring around the collar.  Right.  It was really skid marks in your drawers.  Or maybe if you wanted to choke your wife, it would take out the stains.  Getting back to it.  I got it.  Oh, you got it.  Go.  So, isn't this great?  I got...  Oh, that is it.  Isn't this great? 
[00:20:00]  Oh, that is bad, Jimmy.  Is that terrible?  Oh, one more time.  So, isn't this great?  I got my...  What a horrid actor.  Please get that sound clip for somebody to have whenever something's good.  Whenever something's good or really bad.  Iraq, you writing that down?  Oh.  All right, yeah, we need that.  That was great.  I didn't remember it being that cartoonish.  I knew it was bad.  Oh, it's terrible.  Horrible. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, back to Jeremy Lin for a second, because now everyone's comparing him to Tim Tebow.  And we learned today that...  Oh, no, it's right here.  Why don't I just play this?  Oh, you got a clip.  This is the first bummer about Jeremy Lin right here.  I knew it was coming.  This is gonna be great.  This is the first bummer right here.  Bummer.  I knew it was too good to be true.  An artist you got to check out is Lecrae.  He's a Christian rapper.  Just raps a lot about the gospel and about Christian music.  I really enjoy his lyrics as well. 
[00:21:00]  So, if you're a big lyrics guy, I think that'll be a good fit for you.  I listen to something that mellows me out.  But Hillsong, it's a Christian band.  And they play a lot of contemporary Christian music.  You know, I listen to them just to remind myself why I'm playing the game.  And to remind myself I'm playing a glorified God.  And I just really try to focus on that.  I try not to get too hyped up.  Otherwise, I find myself kind of burnt out before the game or going into the game. 
[00:21:30]  Just with a little too much energy playing out of character.  So, I try to slow it down a little bit.  Is that Jeremy Lin?  Yeah.  The headline here, he loves Christian rock and Christian rap.  Christian rap.  I would have accepted Nickelback or something.  That doesn't even make sense, Christian rap.  What's Christian rap?  I don't know.  That sounds awful.  The whole thing about rap is that it's supposed to be a little edgy and stuff.  Christian rap.  What was the band he mentioned here?  Can we play their...  Do you remember what he said there? 
[00:22:00]  Do you want me to play it again?  Yeah, I play it.  Oh, wait, wait, I got it.  You got it?  Christian rap.  Christian rap.  But between...  All right.  So, is it this great?  So, is it this great?  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Is this it?  Yes.  Lecrae?  Don't waste your life.  Lecrae?  Featuring cam video?  What?  And God.  Featuring God. 
[00:22:30]  He's got three and a half million views, though.  I think between Jeremy Lin and Tim Tebow, I think God is trying to tell us all something.  Yep.  I think it's time to go back to church people.  Oh, I think he's bashing fat people.  Ah.  Let he without Lin cast the first stone.  Oh, I like that.  Don't be a Linner.  What?  The devil can't suck my dick.  The devil can't suck my dick.  Yeah.  What's she like, man? 
[00:23:00]  I know a lot of people that are scared of God.  Couple of them thinking they'll be living in the sky.  While I'm here living, man, I gotta ask why.  What am I here for?  I gotta figure out.  Waste my life?  No, I gotta make it count.  If Christ is real, then what am I gonna do about?  Everything in Luke 12, 15.  Now to 21, you really gotta go and check it out.  Paul said if Christ ain't breast or pregnant, we wasted our lives.  Well, that implies that all life's built around Jesus being alive.  It sounds angry.  If he was singing about chicks, I think I would like this song.  He sounds all angry.  Why is he angry?  He's rapping about God.  He made us form. 
[00:23:30]  Alexis said he saved us form.  Jesus comes and he breaks us form.  Magnify the Father.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Not bad.  No, I like the...  He's got a good stow.  And he's not...  I like the beat or whatever, but...  He's just being a rapper, but he's rapping about that.  I got no problem with that.  Yeah.  That's all right.  God, Jeremy Lin.  Oh, shit.  Jeremy Lin just sold this guy a million records. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, huh?  You know how many people are going, all right, let's just...  Look at that.  Three million views.  I wonder how many are in the last week.  How about the last day?  Yeah, the last fucking day.  He probably had 5,000 views until yesterday.  Yeah.  Is he big, Sam?  Is he popular?  No, I mean, it's not like a big genre at all, but the top comments are already, J-Lin brought  me here.  Thumbs up if J-Lin17 brought you here.  Holy mackerel.  This guy's like, ah, thank you, Lord.  And...  Why couldn't he like dirty comedy?  Yeah.  All I had to say was, I get ready for the game. 
[00:24:30]  Listen to Jim Norton.  The Opie Anthony show.  Look, I enjoy it on SiriusXM, but it's just, it's dirty and it reminds me of what not  to do and whatever, even if it was bad.  Yeah, man.  The Lin, say Opie Anthony.  Come on, let's do this.  Oh, yeah.  We can do this.  With his religious background now.  Hey.  That's going to be great.  I'm a child of fucking 80s.  Of the Lord.  Oh.  Of the Lord also.  Of the Lord.  All the comments are either...  I'm a child of the Lord and I'm a child of the 80s.  I don't think either of those things are true. 
[00:25:00]  All the comments are either Jeremy Lin brought me here or they're just trashing it.  Oh.  Damn, this shit goes hard as fuck.  Ha ha.  No, wait.  It's retarded.  It's not bad.  I mean, it's just...  The guy looks like he's a thug.  He doesn't look like a...  Maybe he's a reformed thug or something.  A lot of those guys get religion in jail.  Or maybe he's making believe he's a thug.  Right.  The first dick that goes in your hiney hole in jail, you fucking go, Jesus!  That's why there's people so much religion.  It's just people yelling as their faces mashed up against the fuck. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, God!  No!  Jesus!  You're getting a big dick in your ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big one.  One more...  Fat.  One more headline for the basketball fans out there.  Carmelo Anthony's coming back from a groin injury.  Yeah.  So they've been winning all these games without Carmelo Anthony.  He was the big get for the Knicks, right?  And everyone is very scared if Carmelo and Lin could play together.  Yeah.  Because Carmelo Anthony has been known as a ball hog, but they interviewed him and he goes,  I'm no ball hog.  No one would ever call me a ball hog to my face. 
[00:26:00]  Not to his face.  But a lot of people have noticed that over the years.  He likes to keep the ball a little longer than most.  Well, if he steps in and they lose, that's going to look bad, right?  I think he plays tomorrow.  Yeah.  Seven games in a row, he comes back to the court, they lose, that's going to suck for  him.  You know, it's got to happen that way.  It really has to happen that way.  It has to, right?  They will lose.  Tomorrow.  Bet on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, tomorrow would be a good bet.  Bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet,  bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet. 
[00:26:30]  Ancient Chinese Secret.  Let's go with that one.  Ancient Chinese Secret, huh?  Our show needs an official fucking nickname for Lin.  Want to go with that one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But if you say it, I guess it's racist.  I don't...  You a racist.  I don't understand that.  Hey, uh...  Fucking, uh, Governor Christie out there in Jersey, how do you feel about him, uh, putting  the flags at half-mast for Whitney Houston?  A lot of people very, very upset by this.  Eh.  Because other, uh, worthy people have died and he did not do, do that for them. 
[00:27:00]  No.  And he was defending himself.  Do we have the clip of him defending himself, Sam?  What did he say?  That because she had a good voice, we should...  She influenced...  She was a Jersey person.  Jersey person.  They did the same thing.  Influenced a lot of people in Jersey and around the world and blah, blah, blah.  They did it for Clarence and nobody really, you know, was up in arms about that.  Who else did it for?  They did it for Sinatra, I guess, when Sinatra died.  Anyone from, you know, Jersey...  Of note.  Yeah.  And it's not like a week of mourning.  It's on a Saturday.  Is that it, maybe? 
[00:27:30]  I don't know.  I don't really...  He's explaining it.  I don't care.  I mean, obviously there's...  A lot of people in Jersey care.  There is this apathy towards, you know, soldiers and police officers that have died in the  line of duty.  And then, you know, you get this Whitney Houston and she dies and, you know, the press is all  over it.  The people are like, oh, it's terrible.  There's flying flags at half-staff.  But, you know, we forget about...  A complicated shot.  ...real important people.  And she left to ring around the tub. 
[00:28:00]  Yes.  Scrubbing bubbles.  Scrubbing bubbles.  This...  This isn't great?  Isn't this great?  No, he didn't think it was.  Isn't this great?  Isn't this great?  Who gets that clip?  I want it.  I want it for my machine.  No!  Everyone needs it.  You're not responsible enough for a machine.  I need a machine.  No.  The upswell is happening.  Yes.  It's time.  It's time.  Yes!  I wouldn't abuse it.  There's got to be a gym machine once in a while. 
[00:28:30]  There is.  Isn't this great?  Look what I bring to the table.  The upswell is great.  And this.  You could have this in your machine.  That's right.  And I would pop lock while I play.  Is this fucking...  Is this great?  No!  I officially have the clip.  I officially have it.  This song is so bad.  Whoop, whoop, whoop.  They were like...  If they said, look, we need a goofy song, this is it. 
[00:29:00]  Did this win any Emmys for music?  And the Emmy for best theme song of a situation comedy goes to The Ropers.  This is like the theme song for domestic violence.  Isn't this great?  Isn't this great?  My God. 
[00:29:30]  Isn't this great?  Anyway, so you don't care about the Christie thing?  No, it's not a big deal.  The latest on Whitney Houston.  Oh, boy.  Still dead?  Still dead.  Funeral Saturday.  Yeah.  And there's going to be a camera.  So I think the world could watch?  Is that what's happening?  Yeah, but they're streaming it on the intranets.  Wow, man.  I hope this doesn't interfere with my web show nomination for the Shorty Awards. 
[00:30:00]  I hope Whitney doesn't get a posthumous shorty for her web show, her dead web show.  Yeah, you're sitting pretty.  I'm sitting right where I want to be, too.  So everyone's happy today.  I don't like the fact that...  Now, voting stops tomorrow at midnight.  That's when voting ends.  Right.  I don't like the way second place is edging up a little bit, a few points. 
[00:30:30]  I still have a lead, but look, people, please just go to shortywards.com and vote for me  in the web show category.  Okay?  Just do it.  Just put me way over the top.  I don't want any bullshit here.  I'm debating if I should be a dark horse and come out of nowhere and get this thing.  Do that.  Or should I stay in eighth place?  No, you need sixth place to qualify.  All right, then I'll stay in eighth.  I don't believe in these voting, because the numbers don't seem to change sometimes.  No, sometimes they don't.  I don't like that at all.  I'm not being ironic when I tell people, don't vote for me. 
[00:31:00]  If I'm not going to be in first place on an award thing like this, I don't want to do it.  Exactly.  I don't want to come in third behind a guy named Smosh.  Smosh.  It's just not...  It doesn't feel good.  I know.  Yeah.  I don't like it.  So I'm not interested in the...  I appreciate the gesture.  I agree.  But I have no desire.  Well, I need to hang on to my first place status.  Yeah, first place, you should.  You want it.  ShortyAwards.com.  It wants it, for real.  And then it's in the web show.  Hey, uh...  Web show category.  You're way ahead of him.  I don't like it, because he was only at, like, 12 and change the other day. 
[00:31:30]  Jesus, dude.  You have no problem, man.  No, no.  I want to pull away like a motherfucker.  Calm down.  You're fine.  Hey.  I can't get more than 700 votes on this fucking thing.  Hey, let's talk to a Jersey guy about the Governor Christie thing, because we don't live  in Jersey.  Bruce?  Bruce.  Jimmy.  RJ.  Hey!  Okay.  RJ.  What's happening, guys?  What's up, RJ?  Not much. 
[00:32:00]  Listen, I've been a cop in New Jersey for about nine years now.  Known for four cops personally, and that fat fuck wouldn't even come out or say anything  about them dying.  Yeah.  If she's dying, they want to find a half-mast.  Ain't gonna happen in my town, I'll tell you that.  Oh, damn.  Good for you, man.  Not in my backyard.  Seriously.  Seriously, good for you.  Nimby.  Wait, you really know four cops that lost their lives and no flags at half-mast?  Well, I mean, ours were at half-mast in a couple surrounding towns, but the Governor  didn't say anything about an order to have the entire state fly them at half-mast. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, good for you.  Fuck that.  Fuck him.  All right, sir.  Thank you, RJ.  All right, gentlemen.  Have a good day.  See you.  Yes.  So it's on the internet.  So someone's gonna be making money off that, huh?  You think they're gonna put ads on there?  I don't know.  They might.  And Nancy Grace is fucking all in that this is a murder.  What?  She's running around on Twitter like, I gotta run.  I got interviews to do. 
[00:33:00]  Once again.  She's reporting that the body was, was she reporting this?  I gotta be careful here.  I believe so.  That Whitney Houston's body was half in and half out of the tunnel.  Oh, no.  She couldn't have had a heart attack due to pills and booze when she was having liquor  set up to her room before 10 in the morning.  I was seen stumbling all over the hotel and had prescription drugs.  You heard all that, right?  Of course.  Yeah.  That couldn't have been that.  No, it's a murder.  Shut up.  She was drinking large quantities of alcohol before 10 a.m. at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  I think she believes Tot Mom did it, is responsible for yet another drowning. 
[00:33:30]  Tot Mom.  Nancy Grace is so hateable.  It's about me, me, me with Nancy Grace.  What's her name on Twitter?  I think I'm going to say something unpleasant to her.  Well, let's make sure we got our facts completely right.  We don't need our facts straight to bash Nancy Grace.  She's so hateable.  Yeah.  Well, let's read her Twitter because she's been writing a lot of stuff.  She's been tweeting.  And if you got a Nancy Grace clip of her saying what I just said, that would be beautiful.  Because then I would look like a star. 
[00:34:00]  That song is so funny.  By L.A.  American Songbird superstar Whitney Houston.  Is that from A Nose Job?  What's that?  American Songbird.  American Songbird?  Yeah.  She's got to come up with these things like Tot Mom, Songbird.  What?  She's an idiot.  Let's do this.  We are live just feet here from the death scene.  L.A.'s Beverly Hilton. 
[00:34:30]  Just feet from the death scene.  She's in on the main road by the hotel.  She's crossed the street.  Houston allegedly found submerged underwater.  Her lungs swimming.  Straight out to special guests joining us here live.  Jen Garcia, assistant editor of People.  She attended the Grammys and has been on the scene.  Look at her fucking head shape.  She's a vulture.  Look at Nancy Grace's head.  Frankenstein.  Oh my God.  Look how hot Whitney Houston used to be.  She was okay.  She looked like she smelled weird. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  She sweat like a motherfucker.  Even in her younger days.  Fuck that.  She was always just drenched in sweat.  We're looking at a picture.  She's early 20s there easily.  No.  That's not an old, old picture, dude.  Come on.  Remember what she looked like in the old, old videos?  She had like the perm, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And her hair was lighter and longer and she was a rail thin.  And, uh, yeah, that, no, that picture is not that old.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  She looks like fucking Frankenstein.  Yeah.  Nancy Grace.  Nancy Grace.  You know who she looks like?  She looks like the guy in Death Wish 2 who said, uh, when Bronson goes, do you believe  in Jesus?  She goes, yes, I do.  You're going to meet him.  You're going to meet him.  That guy.  Right.  I know exactly who you're talking about.  I hate this.  I love that movie.  You know, we don't know all that much right now.  What's clear is that she was found, um, in a tragic state.  Um, you know, what is clear is that, uh, there was a lot of prescription drug use and, 
[00:36:00]  um, you know, it really just is a tragic situation right now.  No shit.  Well, I'm hearing in my ear joining me right now is Don Lemonstein in Anchor.  Is that Don on the phone?  Joining me at the L.A. coroner's office.  Don, thank you for being with us.  What do we know about the autopsy report on Whitney Houston?  Good question because I just spoke with the assistant coroner, Nancy Ed Winter.  Right now, Nancy's head is burrowed into the carcass of a dead animal on the side of 
[00:36:30]  the road.  She's just plucking out fucking entrails, peeking up every so often to talk to this guy.  Holy shit.  That woman is despicable.  She's a real fucking pig.  I don't know if this is the clip.  I, uh, I don't know.  Let me, let me, you could keep playing it, I guess.  She had been removed from the tub.  So, not exactly sure if she was submerged underwater, if there was enough water.  Can you pause?  Being submerged underwater, you can only be submerged underwater, you dumb motherfucker. 
[00:37:00]  She was submerged above the water, which was very odd, the police looking into this.  She was submerged under leaves.  No.  Her lungs to say that she drowned, but by the time the coroner got there, she had been removed  from that tub.  And they're saying that the autopsy results are done, Nancy, but they're waiting on the  toxicology reports to come in, which, as you know.  Because they were trying to revive her. 
[00:37:30]  Like, like, she was removed from the tub when the coroner got there.  Yeah, because they tried to fucking give her CPR.  What kind of ridiculous shit is that?  It's horrible reporting.  It is.  We both covered Michael Jackson, other stars who have dealt with the same thing.  That could take a couple of weeks.  They want to know what drugs, if any, were in her body before they make a final determination.  Autopsy's done, Nancy, but toxicology reports results not in yet. 
[00:38:00]  Back to Don Lemon joining us there at the coroner's office, CNN correspondent Don.  They may know right now whether she died of a deadly dose of drugs pumped into her body  or whether she drowned to death in her own bathtub, but the issue is much more complex  than that.  Who gave her the drugs?  What were the drugs?  And who was with her at the time she went underwater?  She is a death-fucking...  She is in love with death.  She's a fucking pig.  A morbid fucking pig. 
[00:38:30]  She is a capitalizing fucking pig.  She's using all kinds of words that are like, you know, to try to be shocking.  She wants more shock to this story.  And just to make sure that she shoehorns her fucking Frankenberry face into the discussion.  One of the tweets from nine hours ago, rushing to the set of Dr. Drew HLN, more Whitney discussion.  And she hashtags Whitney.  Whitney.  So anybody who's looking at the Whitney hashtag can see. 
[00:39:00]  Yes.  And I got no problem with somebody capitalizing, but just why does she have a different set  of standards to operate under?  Yeah.  Fucking hater.  She needs the vulture hashtag whenever you fucking mention her name.  Vulture.  Hashtag vulture.  You think she eats roadkill in the morning?  Yeah, that's what she eats.  For breakfast?  She just has a fucking possum, a big bloated fucking dead possum on her plate, and she  doesn't use silverware.  She rips it apart with her fucking beak and just pulls rancid entrails out. 
[00:39:30]  Nice.  I got my tweet done.  We all should tweet her, fuck this bitch.  She really, fuck this bitch.  All right, let's go.  Drugs were found.  They're saying that drugs were found in the hotel room and that there were prescription  drugs.  And after the coroner held a briefing, I spoke to him privately and he said, yeah, Don, there  were prescription drugs found in the room, but according to him, Nancy, not out of the  ordinary, he said to me, I have more prescription drugs, meaning the assistant coroner, in my 
[00:40:00]  home than was found in the room.  And of course they know.  I posed that question to him.  I said, listen, the toxicology reports, that's just the final word for you to be 100% sure.  You've been doing this for a while.  You have some idea of what killed someone if you know what you're doing.  He hedged it a little bit and said, we have some suspicion, but we don't want to really  say what happened right now, Nancy.  You know, they know.  Shut up.  They're being very careful.  Yeah.  You know, they just want it to be more than it is. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  So they hint like, whoa, what's going on here?  What's going on here is she obviously wasn't clean and sober, like some people hinted over  the past couple of years.  She drank a lot, had some pills in her, and she fucking blew it.  She blew it.  That's what we're going to find out.  Yeah.  But they're going to take their time with this shit.  They always do, especially in L.A. now. 
[00:41:00]  Because they have fucked up some shit out there in L.A. over the years.  How is Nancy doing with her justice for Kaylee Anthony?  I would like to know that.  Is she still farting on national TV?  What a pig.  That's who she is.  She fucking farts on national TV.  A farting slob.  You fucking Spanx monster.  To answer your question, she's moving on from that because no one cares as much.  Yeah.  It's not in the spotlight, so she'll move on from that.  It's all about Whitney now.  Why are people all about Dave Mustaine's endorsement? 
[00:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's everywhere.  Why?  What's the problem there?  Because he's probably the only guy who would be considered cool or a rock star who would  endorse that douchebag, and it's because he had some religious, I guess, conversion.  Yes.  Dave Mustaine has found the Lord, I believe.  But it was trending on Twitter yesterday.  I just saw another clip on the news.  They're all about Dave Mustaine's endorsement.  A lot of people are endorsing.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  I don't know the back story on that one. 
[00:42:00]  I don't personally give a shit who he votes for or who he doesn't vote.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know why it's his story.  Who cares?  Exactly.  Make fun of it, but.  Yeah, I don't know.  Tentorum's coming out of nowhere.  This week.  We'll see.  It's, uh...  It really is, uh, just odd.  How it's been going back and forth, and then, you know, people that you think, oh, God.  Sorry.  Uh, and we're going to go on to Michigan.  All right.  Yeah!  We're just watching MSNBC. 
[00:42:30]  Every time he pops up.  Yeah!  And then Arlie Ermey.  Arlie Ermey's a spokesperson for the NRA right now.  Yeah.  Talking about that.  Who can they best support, and who has their like beliefs, and go down and vote for this  person.  Yeah.  It's got to register to vote first.  Exactly right.  And that's, that's the problem, getting them away from that computer long enough to do that.  You know what, Gunny?  You're absolutely right, and unless you register to vote, you can't complain.  You've got to be part of the process, don't you? 
[00:43:00]  They always say that.  Yes, and I understand.  That fucking drives me nuts.  They always say that one.  That is the dumbest thing to say to anybody.  Oh, shit.  I want to complain.  Really?  Really?  Can I register to complain?  You want to register to complain?  No, no, I want to register to vote so I can complain.  Ah, okay, we get it now.  What a dumb thing to say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You even agree with that, right?  Yeah, it's stupid.  Please.  Fucking Carlin said it best.  I know.  About not voting.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy just bit his own teeth. 
[00:43:30]  I love when Jimmy bites his own teeth.  Let's come back, maybe can we talk about our pal Joe, who was in court to see this Russian.  Oh, yes.  This piece of shit.  I read that article last night.  It's infuriating.  Joe?  Joe Lozito, yeah.  This piece of garbage.  He's here.  Guy was in here.  Stabbing.  One of the stabbing victim.  Oh, we got an update on him?  Well, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He went to court yesterday.  Oh, fuck you.  Let's talk about it.  He faced the fucking fucking real sucker.  And if you don't think we should just take people outside and put bullets in their head.  Yeah, yeah.  There's one answer. 
[00:44:00]  Take him outside and pump a bullet into his head.  He's of no value.  The guy should just be fucking killed.  Absolutely.  Oh, he's hateable, man.  All right.  We'll have an update on that.  And we'll go with Black History Month here.  And later today, we might have tickets to a big concert.  I don't know.  Sam, I don't know.  You can't say.  So I'm allowed to say that much.  I'm just wondering.  But we don't know.  I don't know.  And we got Andrew Lincoln from The Walking Dead coming in today.  Nice.  Yes.  I just watched, actually, the season premiere. 
[00:44:30]  I had it on DVR.  And I watched it.  And wow.  It was really good.  Like, they do shit on that show that's like, other shows would be like, oh, you can't do that.  That probably doesn't test well.  Yeah.  But they don't care.  Yeah.  But first this.  For Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the individuals whose contributions have shaped the African-American community and changed all of us for the better. 
[00:45:00]  Today, we salute basketball star and kept man Lamar Odom.  Lamar broke new ground in the African-American community by not only being a professional athlete, but by marrying a thick white woman.  Lamar defeated black stereotypes by being with a woman whose real father is questioned more than his own.  I want to get married right now.  You would marry me?  I would do it right now.  We met on the 27th.  Mm-hmm.  Your birthday is on the 27th.  So we should get married on the 27th. 
[00:45:30]  You want to get married on my birthday?  This one.  Your favorite number is seven?  Yes.  And then there's two of us?  So it's two, seven.  There's two of us.  And do you remember the last flight that I took from New York?  Uh-huh.  Was United Flight 27.  Thank you, Lamar, and lots of luck with that beast.  Stay tuned as we continue to recognize significant African-American contributions for Black History Month here on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:46:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You've got me crazy.  I just can't see.  I'm so excited.  I'm in too deep.  It corrected itself.  They are lucky.  Well, it's still should bash them.  I don't know what's going on, but once again, all our Twitters exploded with the fact that the online feed is not working. 
[00:46:30]  It was looping.  It was playing a show from yesterday.  Blah, blah, blah.  We hear this all the fucking time.  We've talked to the bosses.  They go, I don't know.  It seems like it's working for me.  And Mars comes running in with his, what do you got?  It's a phone.  An Android.  All right.  So Mars has some kind of Android phone.  He turned it on, and it absolutely was Tom Papa from yesterday looping instead of hearing this wonderful show that we're putting on today.  Yes, and we're about to prove it by just playing Mars' Android live on our show right now, but I guess it corrected itself just a mere minute ago. 
[00:47:00]  He's restarting the app to see how it starts because it did, like it went to commercial, and then it corrected itself so it was on track with us.  But I try to tell the guys down the hall, trust me, I'll try not to bitch, but these people are frustrated.  Yeah.  It is happening all the time.  And we're getting a lot of tweets about it.  I mean, a lot.  Constantly. 
[00:47:30]  Not just one or two, like somebody just was dumb and then did something on their own.  But it's happening enough where it's an obvious issue, and now when I'm reading a lot more than I want to, look, I'm giving up.  I want to listen to you guys, but the online app is ridiculous, so I have to give up.  I just want to let you guys know that.  And I'm hearing that a lot.  Are people also making sure they're clicking go to live?  Because, like, the thing now—  Well, Mars would know, and it was happening with Mars today. 
[00:48:00]  You have to push go to live.  If you don't shut down the app completely, it pauses sometimes where you left it so you can pick back up because you don't have to listen live anymore.  So if you don't click go to live, sometimes it won't be.  But that wouldn't explain the looping, though.  But it also wouldn't explain why so many people haven't had it at once.  True.  Today it was looping on Mars' Android phone because all of a sudden I checked my Twitter.  I'm like, whoa, here we go again.  And Mars came running in here and said, yeah, look, this is what I'm hearing right now. 
[00:48:30]  And it was yesterday's show looping.  And it's done through another company, right?  I don't know.  Another company?  Mars said it's done through Quick Play.  Quick Play is another company in Toronto who actually does the online feed or something.  And sometimes it's only this show that fucks up.  Only this show.  How is that happening by accident?  Somebody explain that to me.  How?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  But, you know, without mentioning names, the guys down the hall, they're no help with this issue.  They can't figure it out.  But it's happening.  And now we're losing subscribers. 
[00:49:00]  That is happening.  Guaranteed.  People are going, look, I can't do this anymore.  I'm sorry.  But it's too frustrating.  I want to do this, but I can't do this anymore.  Yeah.  If you're not going to give us a video element or a studio of a suitable size,  can you at least make sure that the online feed works so that in 2012 people can hear  us on the fucking computer?  Because how does it feel that podcasts are now what people are talking about?  Yeah.  I can't believe we have to ask for that.  Can you at least make sure they can listen to us through the phone? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  We don't even want, you know what, the whole, yeah, we give up.  How about they hear us?  We give up on the visual element, the lights, the bigger studio, any type of respect for the  company, but can you at least make sure they can hear us on their phones?  Thank you.  Can we at least have podcast quality on the computer?  That's all we want is to have Bob Kelly's podcast quality.  Right.  Look, you win, you've beat us down, but all we ask at this point is that our listeners  can hear us on their phones, please.  Much like they do a podcast, yes. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  That'd be nice.  It's unbelievable.  Say the company, not this company, but that QuickTime company.  I don't know.  It wouldn't surprise me if there was some shenanigans going on there, because how does  the same show always have trouble?  I don't know.  There's no difference between our show and some other show?  My answer is, I don't know, because that's what they tell me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It is just infuriating. 
[00:50:30]  Jimmy, you said QuickTime.  It's QuickPlay.  I'm sorry.  QuickPlay.  My fault.  My fault.  QuickPlay.  QuickPlay.  Obviously my fault.  QuickPlay.  What's going on up there in Toronto?  Tell us.  See, now the phones are lit with people.  I'm so frustrated with the online app.  It's a real issue.  It stinks.  It fucking stinks.  Seems like it might be the Androids.  My iPhone.  iPhone's not so much.  I don't have a problem personally with my iPhone.  I'm so happy BlackBerry's fucking up again.  I know my wife listens to the iPhone because I'm too lazy. 
[00:51:00]  I don't have our channel.  I don't have our channel in my car anymore, and I don't have it in the house.  Really?  I don't have SiriusXM in the house at this point.  Why don't you just call and have them do it in the phone?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you do?  You call and they fix it.  So she has to listen to the show through a phone.  These are not big tasks.  That's a little thing.  That's a big task.  It's not.  That's a big one.  I'm raising a kid.  That's too big for me right now. 
[00:51:30]  Too much trouble.  Too much trouble, Ann.  You know.  I'd rather watch everything just break down around me than fix it.  Just crumble?  You know how many light bulbs I need in my house at this point?  Oh, man.  Really?  Are you the guy that turns the light switch on and nothing happens guy?  Well, in my bathroom, I got six.  You know, it's one of those things.  It has six light bulbs.  I'm down to two.  I'm like, well, I can still see with two.  I like when you hear that sound.  Oh, fuck.  There goes another one. 
[00:52:00]  I got to change light bulbs.  Walking around with your iPhone light.  Yeah.  Just going to brush my teeth.  The problem is happening with other stations, too.  Oh, okay.  That's Vinny.  But I've heard over the last, God, it has to be at least a year we've been hearing the  same shit that this online app is not working properly.  And I've heard over and over again that a lot of times it's just our channel.  But now this guy is saying it's happening with other channels, so I don't know.  I don't even know why we brought this up, because nothing will be done. 
[00:52:30]  No.  We'll hear some weird thing like, I don't know.  We checked it out.  It looks like it's working fine.  Yeah, that's what the thing is.  They go, no, we popped it up and everything seems to be fine.  And we call the company and we talk to our tech people.  Everyone's like, no, it's working fine.  It must just be a rare case out there.  Yeah, that's all it is.  Wire.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Wire.  Everything's fine.  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Does Nicole remember being just a drunk slob on our show yesterday? 
[00:53:00]  There they all go, all together.  They go together as a show to the little coffee room.  Yeah, they just walk by.  I wonder if she remembers being just fucking wasted yesterday.  I saw her before running down the hallway.  She was running apparently late again.  And I said, hey, Nicole, are you doing it?  She said, better than yesterday.  I'm like, all right.  Oh, wow.  People kind of enjoyed her on the show yesterday.  She's great.  Yeah, I guess.  Admitting taking loads on the face.  Oh, man, that's right.  She did.  Jimmy, you were very, very mad going into break there. 
[00:53:30]  I just think that there are certain times in the country we should be able, in the back  of a courthouse, to cut somebody's throat, or to just put a bullet in their head.  And we had Joe Lozato on.  Lozito, I'm sorry.  Lozito, yeah.  Who I've met many times at MMA events.  He's a big fan of this show.  He was a great, great guest on the show, talking about this Russian piece of garbage that killed  his stepfather and a couple other people, went on a rampage, and then attacked Joe randomly. 
[00:54:00]  Huge story last year, right?  Yeah.  And then this guy ran into Joe on the subway after he did all that craziness on the streets.  And Joe took him down with an MMA move and got stabbed a bunch of times, but subdued  this guy.  And the cops apparently, according to Joe, did nothing.  The guy didn't come out of the fucking conductor's car to help him.  Yeah.  So that's good news.  And the headline is talking about this guy.  His name is Makes Him Gelman. 
[00:54:30]  And he's a complete piece of...  Gelman!  What are you doing, Gelman?  You're stabbing people in the head, Gelman!  And our pal Joe there was pretty much left for dead.  They didn't think he was going to make it.  I mean, the scars.  And you weren't here that day?  Holy fuck!  Oh, you didn't hear that?  No, I heard it.  He heard the interview, but you didn't see the scars.  No.  There are those raised scars that don't seem like they're going to go away anytime soon?  Yeah.  I saw them in pictures, but I'm sure in real life it was...  Massive scars.  Pretty nasty.  Massive one across the back of his head.  Sure.  Whatever. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Well, this guy had stabbed his stepfather, and I don't know if it was his mother, who  else he had killed.  Crazy-ass Russian guy, right?  Hold on.  Because he proposed to Kim Kardashian.  I guess a little attention whore needs some more attention.  Oh, yeah.  He wanted to get a...  He proposed to her, what?  Just in court.  He just blurted it out.  He's a piece of garbage.  Great.  He is an attention whore.  He was convicted of attempting to murder Lizito, and Lizito made a victim impact statement. 
[00:55:30]  He made eye contact with Gelman, and he said, when I attacked you and I took you down,  when you attacked and I took you down, you went down real easy, Lizito told him, and  the guy barked back, you didn't take me down, you jerk-off.  And then he slammed him as the funniest Russian since Yakov Smirnoff, which is pretty funny,  a real slam.  And Lizito said, I appreciate you chose me. 
[00:56:00]  I really do.  Maybe if you continued your extreme cowardice, you would have picked on another person, a  woman, maybe she couldn't defend herself, or a child.  So, like, he really fucking, he really told this guy what a fucking punk he was, and how  easy he went down, and that's going to drive this guy nuts for the next 25 fucking years.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's in the paper, and everybody had to hear that.  He just loves the attention, though.  But yeah, but this guy loves the attention, and he really should be, you know, I just hope  something happens to him in jail.  Terrible.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  I hope something terrible happens to him in jail.  But it probably won't.  No, this code, you know, this code that convicts supposedly have, oh, the convict.  But most of them are fucking animals, and they don't have the code.  Yeah.  Where is it?  Yeah, there's no fucking, none of this chivalry in prison.  I watch enough of those goddamn shows, and it just seems like they have a system in there,  and people adhere to that system.  Yeah, they beat up, I think they probably go after Kid Touchers, if the Kid Touchers  are weak.  But Richard Allen Davis, who killed Polly Class, is alive and kicking in jail. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Is he a little too big to take down?  Can't get to all of them, probably.  Having his own little life in there, not even, you know, wakes up in the morning, does  his job, whatever.  Well, because we protect animals in prison, too.  Yes.  Yeah.  I know.  I hate that.  Yeah, I mean, you should be able to just throw these guys in general pop, and that's  it.  Why are you protecting a monster?  Yep.  He's such a monster that other criminals want to get at him.  Yeah.  And then you decide, like, oh, boy, we got to protect this guy, I guess. 
[00:57:30]  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  Fuck that shit.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hell, yeah.  Yeah, that guy, yeah.  I didn't know that guy was a fan of the show.  That's kind of odd.  Joe, is he a big fan?  He came up to me because he mentioned that he watches UFC.  That's how he learned to do that take down.  And Dana loves him now and gives him and his wife good seats every time.  Yeah, that's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Is fucking UFC in Atlanta this weekend? 
[00:58:00]  I think so.  Aren't you in Atlanta?  Yes.  So why don't you go?  Can I have three shows?  That's good.  I'm competing with UFC.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  You have bad luck.  I really fucking do, man.  Hey, the Jon Jones video of him punching the shit out of you and choking you, I finally  put together.  Oh, yeah.  So you can check that out today.  See you more?  Holy fuck!  Look at that bruise!  Oh, man, that's a good one.  That's from Jon Jones.  Oh, man.  Does it hurt?  Wow.  A little sore. 
[00:58:30]  He said it was 70%.  It was a 70% punch.  It hurt.  Wow.  It definitely hurt.  The video's pretty good.  Yeah, I saw it.  Because Bob Kelly had a close-up with his iPhone that I was waiting on, and I edited it into  the video.  So you can find it in all the usual places, I do believe, right?  Is it on our Facebook page there, Iraq?  It's going up right now.  Oh, it's going up right now, is it?  How about yesterday?  Because I didn't know you posted it yesterday.  Well, how about you pay attention?  I want my fucking website fixed.  I'm not trusting Facebook or MySpace, because MySpace is such shit now. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's such shit.  But I'm saying any of these social networking sites, there's always a message when it comes  along.  MySpace isn't as shitty as it used to be.  It's all fucking spam.  I went to my MySpace recently.  30 straight pages of spam.  It's garbage.  Jimmy, I'm telling you, it's making a comeback.  I just read an article where a whole bunch of people joined MySpace recently.  They're cleaning that shit up, because, what?  Is it Timberlake's thing now with a few people?  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  He's a part owner.  Okay, well, here's what Justin Timberlake should do.  Don't be surprised.  MySpace is going to make a comeback.  I'm telling you.  Well, here's what they should do.  Right now, it's not good.  But when you open an email, say it's from fucking some spam site, you should be able  to delete all emails from this user.  Oh, that's a good one.  That should be an option.  Delete all emails from this user, and how about you're able to one-click block from your  email screen?  Don't make me go to this scumbag's profile and click on block, and then I still have 
[01:00:00]  to filter out his email?  Yeah.  That's fucking annoying.  It should literally be a one-button thing.  Block this user.  Delete all emails from this user.  It should be two options.  I just hate that I have to update my Twitter, update my Facebook, update my website, update  Google+.  Why can't we just have one thing?  Well, you can do that.  You can tie them all together.  Yeah, nah, but sometimes, like a tweet, sometimes if you tweet something, you don't need to put  it on your Facebook as well. 
[01:00:30]  You know what I mean?  You can't do it that way.  You know what I mean?  You could do all of them if you want, or you don't have to.  Nah, because some of the tweets don't work if it's a Facebook update.  Oh, because they're a hashtag response to somebody else's.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  So you have to kind of pick and choose if you're doing it properly.  Some of these people don't do it properly.  They're lazy.  You've really got to pick and choose.  And then the Google+, I hear more and more people are joining Google+.  What?  It fucking stinks.  No one cares about it.  No one's joining.  Who told you that?  Fucking Larry Google?  Larry Google.  Larry Google. 
[01:01:00]  They're joining the Google+, with the circles.  No one I know is doing that.  I don't even know what circle to put people in.  When it first came out, a couple of people were like, hey, check this out.  And then it just went away.  It went away.  And then I'm a Husay guy, but I don't know how to incorporate the Husay yet.  And Javi from Husay is calling me all the time.  He's like, are you going to use Husay?  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to use Husay.  I just don't know how to incorporate it.  Help me out, sir.  Too much, Hank.  It really is. 
[01:01:30]  It's just too much.  It used to be one little website.  And now is it.  That's all you got to worry about.  Now, you're all over the place.  I got to deal with a guy named Javi.  Javi?  Javi, I'll get back to you.  I got a friend, Shirley, that's bigger than you.  Dude, I had...  Shirley.  Yesterday, oh, man, I look like a dummy.  I had to turn off my Twitter.  I was so embarrassed.  I checked my YouTube account.  And ESPN is writing me like crazy.  And I mean like crazy, because they were really wanting to get a hold of me. 
[01:02:00]  They wanted to use the Bob Kelly getting choked out by John Jones video on ESPN.  Yeah.  ESPN 2, I believe.  So I'm like panicking.  And I couldn't write the lady back.  So now I'm just writing on Twitter so everyone else could see.  This should have been a private email like, hey, Mary, I can't get a hold of you.  But yes, please use the video that we shot in the studio.  I don't know what was going on with the YouTube account yesterday.  I just couldn't reply to her for some reason.  So now I'm publicly saying, like, looking pretty desperate, to be honest with you. 
[01:02:30]  Like, yeah, sure, play the video.  Yes, we give permission.  She gets back to me like, great, we're going to use it today.  So then, of course, what do you do?  You're on Twitter like, hey, guys, you know that video of Bob Kelly getting choked out by John Jones?  I saw that.  Oh, you did see it?  Yeah, yeah.  ESPN 2, 430.  It's some show that this guy does with his father.  It was kind of, it was all right, I guess.  And then people are starting to, you know, I got everyone to watch this show yesterday. 
[01:03:00]  And now they're going, running out of time.  And I'm like, no, man, between now and five, they told me.  And then people writing, sounds like you're panicking a little bit there, sir.  And then five o'clock comes, and they didn't fucking show the video after all that.  I start reading the fucking tweets.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, you won't find them, because then I deleted all the tweets.  I'm a good deleter.  Sometimes you got to delete tweets, too.  It's smart.  You got to keep your shit clean. 
[01:03:30]  Like your pubic hair.  You got to keep your Twitter clean.  You got to trim some shit down.  So all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, my God.  After all that, they didn't even fucking play the video.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  I was embarrassed.  You were embarrassed.  So I had to turn off Twitter for a couple hours.  I just didn't want to know what they were writing.  And then I deleted the tweets, you know.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  By the way, the Shorty Award, this is why I hate them, are showing I've gotten eight votes in like a week.  There's something wrong with that voting. 
[01:04:00]  That's crazy.  Do not vote for me for that Shorty Award.  For real.  I don't want it.  That means Jimmy wants votes.  No, I really don't.  What?  I'm not being ironic.  I don't want it.  I really don't want it.  I think that I'm not going to say it's rigged, but I think there is something going on, and I want no fucking part of it.  Fuck them.  Shenanigans.  Fuck them.  Shenanigans.  Yeah.  Please, seriously, do not.  You sure?  Want nothing to do with it.  I won't go.  I won't accept it.  It's shit.  Wow.  That's a great way to do it.  So, you want votes? 
[01:04:30]  Vote for me if you want to.  Vote for Smosh, because I won't show up.  It said I had 750 votes like a couple weeks ago or a week ago, and now it said I got 758.  There's something off.  Eight votes.  Stop.  There's something off.  Unless people are just not doing it right, but there's something off.  Well, that's probably true, too.  And if I can't get more than 750 votes, then I literally don't want the award.  I don't deserve it.  That's crazy.  It's fucking embarrassing.  It is.  All right.  On that note, vote for me.  Oh, what?  Do you want it? 
[01:05:00]  Does that mean not vote for you?  No, no, no.  I'm very confused how everyone's doing this now.  I don't want it.  Jimmy wants it, but I say he doesn't.  And you don't want it because you say you want it?  No, I've campaigned, and I'm in the number one position.  Congratulations.  I would like to hold that number one position.  You're going to.  But you're going to be at the table by yourself now.  No, me and Sam.  That's right.  Sam's in.  Well, I'm number two right now, but I'm only 20 votes behind.  You're in?  For what category?  I'm actually in the category of radio.  Where radio?  Yeah, but you guys didn't go for it. 
[01:05:30]  So if you want Opie and Anthony representation in the category of radio, vote for Not Sam on the Shorty Awards.  Dude, why don't we do a Jeremy Lin thing and have everyone vote for us in radio?  In radio in, like, what?  One day.  Let's come out of nowhere like Jeremy Lin and fucking take this.  But you guys don't have, you refuse to get a Twitter together, so one of you would have to work.  Oh, that's right.  Oh.  Oh.  Because you're, that's how it works.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Look, I'm in web show.  Just vote for it.  I'm in radio.  What do you want from me?  I'm in radio. 
[01:06:00]  We'll sit at the table.  Now you're in YouTube, Sam.  No, I'm in radio.  I'm doing it right now.  This is radio.  Yeah, but you don't want the award.  Oh.  You're in radio.  We got a kid crying over a school contest.  Huh?  By the way, we forgot to go topical because we were mad about the online feed.  Oh, shit.  And then the joke thing in the paper.  Oh, wow.  I bet people are crushed.  Yeah, you didn't miss anything.  What were you playing?  I think I heard Britney Spears.  Yeah, but that makes it sound like we want Britney Spears coming back from break.  Well, it fit with you being upset with the online feed.  Why? 
[01:06:30]  Because it's crazy.  Oh, she shaved her head five years ago?  Yep.  Wow.  Time flies.  That's a quick five, huh?  Five years ago.  Wow.  That's not too annoying.  So, is it this great?  Will you take the countdown down? 
[01:07:00]  No.  That's going to trick everybody, by the way.  I love it.  Why do you have it up there?  Because it says my name.  Because it says your name.  That's the only reason.  What's this?  It's on my website, OP Radio.  It says, is this countdown for Sam's unemployment?  Okay, there.  Now you can go somewhere else.  Where do you want me to go?  You were just talking about your stuff.  No, I talked about it.  It's not crazy for me to be on your website right now.  Oh, I guess all the latest videos are up there.  That's a good place to go.  And your YouTube and your Facebook and your Twitter.  But I don't have my Google Plus fucking link up there. 
[01:07:30]  Why would you?  Because I have to fucking worry about that, too.  Google Plus.  You don't Google Plus in.  No one Google Pluses.  Is this?  But you can do individual circles and stuff.  Like, what's a circle?  You have a friend circle.  I don't care about the circle.  I'll just pick and choose people.  I don't think I ever put out a mass, like, Twitter or anything like that.  I don't think I ever, like, I retweet.  And I tweet.  I don't need, like, circles where it's like, well, I just want this message to go to this circle. 
[01:08:00]  And I just want this one to go to this.  No, it's one person.  You can have a family circle.  You can have a friend circle.  Why don't I just fucking punch somebody's name up and go, all right, they're in my family.  Who cares?  You can have a circle for underage gals.  I don't, uh, no.  That's crazy.  No circles.  No circles?  No circles.  How about squares?  How do you feel about squares?  No, Google doing squares.  Why didn't they go squares?  No, it's ridiculous.  Google Plus. 
[01:08:30]  Why not squares, Fezzy?  Why not squares?  Hey there, Fez.  Jimmy's bad again.  Uh-oh.  Just thinking about the great Grammy ceremony.  What happened?  Where they allowed that fucking piece of shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  To perform.  Oh, Chris Brown?  I'm just reading Chris Brown's.  Chris Brown.  I just love the fact.  Team Breezy.  There was a, you're talking about the police report, and they said, um, if this could be  trusted, like, there's a little suspicion that this might. 
[01:09:00]  Maybe people are just scared.  They want to make sure this is real.  I'm putting all my credibility on it.  Oh, this police report?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What do we know about it?  I don't, well, maybe, where is this from?  I don't know.  I don't know, sir.  I don't know.  I don't know, sir.  I don't know, sir.  I'll check one time, sir.  Let me check, sir.  You're not on the list, sir.  I don't see it here, sir.  You were doing that before the show, right?  Yes, sir. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  God damn it, Travis.  That's okay.  He's no shit.  No shit, Travis.  I know everything.  What about this?  It's got circles?  It is real?  That specific printout is from MTV News.  So if it's not real.  It's got to be true.  Wow.  I mean, MTV News isn't really one to just.  You got circles?  I mean, I made circles a few months ago when Google Plus came out.  You're in one of my circles.  You're in one of my circles.  But I don't do anything on Google Plus.  You're in one of my circles. 
[01:10:00]  I feel honored.  Oh.  But yeah, I'm pretty sure that's legit.  So if this is MTV, fuck.  They're brave enough.  No, they're not brave enough is what I'm saying.  So if they're printing this, that means it's probably legit.  They're not going to run with a rumored, maybe leaked police report.  Hell no.  Oh, yeah, nah.  I'll say this.  This is what we have is called the police report.  I don't know for 100% fact if it is or not.  But it seems legit.  And it just goes to show you how they really, when they penalize people for saying fucked up things, 
[01:10:30]  and then this guy is asked to perform three songs.  And it's just mind boggling.  Yeah.  Fucking mind boggling.  Yeah, it's all fucked up out there.  Are black people expected to commit domestic violence?  Like, is that why the music industry and entertainment industry just looks beyond it?  Are blacks expected to be violent by the industry?  Like, on Good Morning America, didn't he throw a fucking, like, break a window or something?  Yeah, yeah, it was very tense.  Yeah, because they want to bring up this shit.  Yeah, like, why is that acceptable? 
[01:11:00]  Sorry, people aren't ready to move on from the fact that you beat the shit out of Rihanna.  Yeah.  Yeah, he, like, ripped off his shirt and trashed his entire dressing room.  Yeah.  Sorry, people are going to ask you.  You're in the fucking public eye.  Doesn't that kind of show that you're not rehabilitated?  Yeah.  Of course.  And isn't that just, it's amazing how they just look beyond that.  Dog the Bounty Hunter said a nigger in a private phone conversation.  And he's a dick.  He sounded like a dick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But oh my God, the outrage.  Yeah.  The outrage.  Yeah.  What do we got here, Jimmy? 
[01:11:30]  Not that he belongs at the Grammys, but, you know.  Do we have to read the whole thing?  Where do we go?  There's a lot here, man.  Yeah, I mean.  So let's start from the beginning.  I normally highlight things, but it just would have all been highlighted.  I thought you just got lazy with the highlighting.  No.  He's the highlighting kid.  That means everything's good here.  The entire page and a half is the police report, and he's just a scumbag.  Jimmy, you want this or what?  If this is, this is what we have.  Court documents released Thursday reveal details about the case against Chris Brown,  including a police statement that the incident began when Rihanna, 
[01:12:00]  her real name is Robin, Rihanna Fenty,  found a text on Brown's cell phone from a woman who Brown had had a previous sexual relationship with.  Now, this is saying, I don't know if this is the police report or a summation of the police report,  or I don't know.  Well, no, this is what it is, is this is probably the MTV article.  Oh, okay, okay.  So, you know, they're going to add some shit,  and then you get some of the statements from the police report down here.  That's what I see.  A search warrant used by police for cell phone records related to the case 
[01:12:30]  included the sworn statement by the detective,  which he detailed happened on the early...  Okay.  Brown was driving a vehicle with Robin F.  as the front passenger on an unknown street.  That's Rihanna once again.  Yes.  Robin F. picked up Brown's cell phone  and observed a three-page text  from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.  All right, so their boyfriend and girlfriend,  obviously she finds something...  This will cause a situation.  Yeah, a huge fight.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Brown was driving...  A verbal argument ensued,  and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street,  reached over to Robin with his right hand,  opened the car door,  and attempted to force her out.  Brown was unable to force her out of the vehicle  because she was wearing a seatbelt,  and he could not force her to exit.  He took his right hand and shoved her against...  Her head against the passenger window,  causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.  Robin F. continued to face Brown,  and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand.  He then drove away in the vehicle 
[01:13:30]  and continued to punch her in the face  with his right hand  while steering the vehicle with his left.  The assault caused Robin F.'s mouth to fill with blood  and blood to splatter all over her clothing  and the interior of the vehicle.  I'm jerking off over here.  I'm starting to think we should allow texting and driving  because, man, this guy's able to punch a bitch  and drive at the same time.  And drive.  Why can't I get a little LOL out there every once in a while?  No, no, no.  Don't say punch a bitch  because you'll get in trouble for that.  Right.  Like when Homeless Charlie did jokes 
[01:14:00]  about fucking raping the Queen of England.  We got in trouble for that.  Right.  We weren't invited to appear  on a nationally televised award show.  Right.  Probably because we don't have the talent  to be on an award show.  But that aside, that aside...  Well, that aside, sure.  You know, good thing things are...  This guy's multitasking.  It's the point I'm making.  Justly made it out.  Un-fucking-believable.  It's not unbelievable, though.  No, no.  They were shocked that the radio station  would allow such things to air.  But I guess in the eyes of entertainment in general,  this is not shocking behavior. 
[01:14:30]  Because why?  And I'm sure a lot of this was known  for the people that are involved with the Grammys.  They know this shit.  They must know this shit.  Well, if I'm reading it,  like if these are accurate details...  This has been out there a while.  ...then they know it.  Yes.  Brown looked to Robin F.  and said,  I'm going to beat the shit out of you  when we get home.  You wait and see.  What had he been doing to her?  I don't like the fact that he said,  you wait and see,  like he's in a 1950s movie.  You wait and see, you.  You wait and see, man.  What a fucking dick.  The detective said Robin 
[01:15:00]  then used her cell phone  to call a personal assistant  who did not answer.  Robin F. pretended to talk to her  and said,  I'm on my way home.  Make sure the police are there  when I get there.  After she faked the call,  Brown looked at her and stated,  you just did the stupidest thing ever.  Now I'm really going to kill you.  Brown resumed punching Robin F.  And then she interlocked her fingers  behind her head  and brought her elbows forward  to protect her face.  She then bent over at the waist,  placing her elbows and face  near her lap  in an attempt to protect her face 
[01:15:30]  and head from the barrage of punches  being levied upon her by Chris Brown.  Brown continued to punch Robin F.  on the left arm and hand,  causing her to suffer a contusion  on her left tricep  that was approximately  two inches in diameter  and numerous contusions  on her left hand.  She then attempted  to send a text message  to her other personal assistant.  Brown snatched the cell phone  out of her hand  and threw it out the window  onto an unknown street.  So if worse, he's a litterer.  In the best case, he's a litterer.  Is that phone still out there somewhere? 
[01:16:00]  I hope so.  Some homeless guy's play.  I thought my litterer joke  would do better,  but I fucked up what I said  at best, at worst, whatever.  And once again,  Robin F. is Rihanna,  if you're just turning in.  Brown continued driving  and Robin F. observed  his cellular phone  sitting in his lap.  She picked up the phone  with her left hand  and before she could make a call,  he placed her in a headlock  with his right hand  and continued to drive  with his left.  Once again, you're right,  this guy can multitask  behind the wheel.  We shouldn't make fun of it.  Don't make fun of it  because we'll get in more trouble 
[01:16:30]  than he actually got into  for beating the shit out of her.  And I don't mean with the law,  I mean in entertainment as a whole.  Maybe we should be invited  on to Good Morning America  to...  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Brown pulled her closer to him  and bit her on her left ear.  She was able to feel  the vehicle swerving  from right to left  as Brown sped away.  He stopped the vehicle  in front of...  And Robin F. turned off  the car,  removed the ignition  and sat on it.  Oh, all right. 
[01:17:00]  Brown did not know  what she did with the key  and began punching her  in the face and arms.  He then placed her  in a headlock  positioning the front  of her throat  between his bicep  and forearm.  Kind of like John Jones  did me.  Yeah.  Brown began applying pressure  to Robin F.'s left  and right...  How do you say...  Carotid...  How do you say that word?  Carotid arteries.  Carotid arteries.  Yes.  Causing her to be unable  to breathe  and she began  to lose consciousness.  She reached up  with her left hand  and began attempting  to gouge his eyes  in an attempt  to free herself.  Brown bit her left ring 
[01:17:30]  and middle fingers  and then released her.  While Brown continued  to punch her,  she turned around  and placed her back  against the passenger door.  She brought her knees  to her chest,  placed her feet  against Brown's body  and began pushing him away.  Brown continued  to punch her  on the legs and feet,  causing several contusions.  Robin F. began  screaming for help  and Brown exited  the vehicle  and walked away.  A resident  in the neighborhood  heard her plea  ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  At the end  of the statement,  Andrews,  who I think  is the detective,  said Brown sent  a text message  nine days later 
[01:18:00]  apologizing.  In the text message,  he apologized  and advised  he was going for help.  So I guess  that's great,  great Grammy performances.  So I guess  that's what the,  I guess that's  what the entertainment industry  kind of expects  black men to do.  It's the only reason  I can think of  why that behavior  is penalized  less by entertainment  than saying  fucked up things.  And it's not only that,  because I've seen  people online  and Andy Levy 
[01:18:30]  has gotten into  brawls with his fans.  Sure.  And what I see  is a bunch of  black women  defending the living  shit out of this guy.  and just spewing  venom at anybody  who insults  Team Breezy.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  It's astounding.  Yeah.  It's not, though.  So I guess  that's what's expected.  It's the only thing  I can think of.  Yeah.  It's got to be.  It's disgusting.  It's got to be that. 
[01:19:00]  It really is disgusting.  What a fucking idiot.  Please.  Yeah, but they're  pretty much forgiving him  at this point.  And then there's rumors  that Rihanna  and Chris Brown, what?  What's the rumor, Sam?  You're in that world.  They might be back together  or thinking about it.  Those rumors have been,  yeah, surfacing a little bit.  They've been seen together  and cladding together.  They're both fucking idiots.  If they are,  then she's as,  unless there's a lot there.  One thing is,  did she hit him first?  There's a lot that's not mentioned  that maybe happened.  Like, I can't say that  she didn't belt him first. 
[01:19:30]  You got to think  she's just ridiculously stupid.  If she is,  she deserves what she gets.  And I'm saying that.  If she's back with him,  she deserves what she gets.  You know what you're going to get.  Yeah, that's stupid.  If you get with a guy  who's already beaten you up  and you're already out of it  and you're free,  you're a dummy  who deserves what to get.  If that's true.  Jeez, man.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Team Brady.  Huh?  Motherfucker.  Yeah, it's amazing  if you insult him  that his fans get very upset.  His fans get upset  and his female fans. 
[01:20:00]  The same people, by the way,  and again,  I hate to keep going back to this,  but those are the same  probably female fans  who are very offended  at nappy-headed hoes.  Oh, yes.  They don't for some reason  think it's cool  to back him up.  It's just...  There's no logic, reason,  or anything behind  what goes on.  I have no clue.  Isn't this great?  See?  Isn't this great?  All right.  Terrible.  Why don't we break here?  Right, right, right.  Do something.  Eat some oatmeal.  Right, right, right.  Think about what  we're going to do next. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, Floyd Mayweather  slammed Linsanity  on Twitter  because he said  it was a hype  due to race.  Well, we never see that  the other way around,  do we, Floyd?  Oh, God.  Don't we like Floyd?  Shut up.  Floyd's been in here, right?  Yeah, he was all right.  He was kind of a fucking  too hip for the room guy  with his sunglasses on.  Oh, yeah.  He said...  Let me see.  Jeremy Lin's a good player,  but all the hype  is because he's Asian.  Black players do  what he does every night  and don't get the same praise.  That's stupid.  But it's also kind of true.  It is kind of true.  No, it's not kind of true.  Lin came out of nowhere.  This story's different 
[01:21:00]  than what's going on.  It's a very different story  because here's a guy,  it doesn't make sense.  He played for Harvard.  No one gives a shit  about Harvard  and college basketball.  And then he's sort of  in the league  and no one really  picks him up.  Then he plays  NBA summer basketball  and the Knicks just go,  ah, you know,  we kind of need a point guard.  So they pick him up  December 27th  and then he's  the starting guard  and they've won  seven in a row  and for most of those games  he's scored over 20 points.  This is a very unique story.  But it's also because 
[01:21:30]  And I don't know  a black point guard  right now  is putting up numbers  like Jeremy Lin  just did in the last  seven games.  But there are very,  very few Asian stars  in the NBA.  It's more interesting  because he looks different  than anybody in the league.  So all of a sudden  there's this Asian guy.  I don't see the race thing  in this, sorry.  Oh, I do.  I guess it helps the story  because there's not a lot  of Asian guys in the NBA.  Right.  But this kid  has come out of nowhere.  When a black basketball player,  you know,  is doing exactly  what he's doing,  you're already,  you've known the guy's name 
[01:22:00]  since high school.  No one knows  who this Jeremy Lin guy  was two weeks ago.  But I don't see this  as being racist though  because he's not saying  fuck him.  He's saying that  there's all this hype  around him.  Because when's the last time  the team went on  a six-game winning streak  in the middle of the season?  Or seven.  And they're acting  like it's Jordan.  No, no.  It's seven games in a row  with a guy  that wasn't proven  in the NBA  on a team  that lost  their two big stars  to injury.  Well, not injury.  Stoudemire's brother died 
[01:22:30]  and Carmelo Anthony  had a groin injury.  This is a very unique story.  It is.  Way more than race  in my opinion.  It's a part of it.  It's like saying  Tiger Woods' race  is never...  The fact that he was  a black guy  doing what he did  made it more interesting  because he was a black guy  playing golf as well.  It didn't take away  from his talent.  No one's saying  Jeremy Lin doesn't  deserve the praise.  Maybe the race thing  will come into it more  as this continues  because there's not  a lot of Asians  in the NBA,  but I think the fact  that this came out  of nowhere  is way bigger 
[01:23:00]  than race at this point.  Didn't you see  all those Asians  that are coming  to the games now  that weren't there before?  Right, right.  That's because  they're feeling the hype too.  They're showing it  in Chinatown.  It is part of it.  Everyone's coming  to the table.  I can't tell you  how many people  I've talked to  in the last week or so  that said,  I'm a Knicks fan again.  We haven't heard  that in years.  I wasn't a Knicks fan.  I'm officially saying  yeah, I'm a Knicks fan  because of what  this kid is doing.  Period.  When Arabu came  to the Yankees,  there was a lot  of hype around him  because he was  a decent pitcher,  but there was  so much hype 
[01:23:30]  because there weren't  that many Asian guys  doing it.  But they knew  who he was.  He was proven  in Japan,  wasn't he,  at that point?  Yeah.  He was the Japanese  Nolan Ryan.  Jeremy Lin,  no one wanted him  this past summer,  basically.  No one wanted him.  Yeah.  No one wanted him.  And there's,  I don't get this one.  It just happens  sometimes, I guess.  It falls through  the cracks.  You just don't,  you know,  you don't come out  of nowhere  and just start scoring  20, you know, 
[01:24:00]  over 20 points a game.  Yeah.  And over 10 assists  in most of these games.  It's got to be  so odd to be Asian.  Every TV I look at,  whenever I see  an Asian guy,  I think it's  the Lin story.  It's like politicians  and some writer  from the New York Times.  I look over here  and like any Asian guy  I see now  is like,  oh,  the story's about  But they even know  they all look alike.  That's why they tried  dyeing their hair.  Yeah.  I want to look different.  My favorite,  by the way,  are the young Japanese men 
[01:24:30]  and then they have  the mullet  and then they spiked up  hair that's blonde  and it's like,  America,  rock and roll.  They want to be recognized.  It's hilarious.  They're sick of looking  like every other person  walking down the street.  But you say that,  us saying it today  is we're taking a risk.  Nothing funnier also  than an Asian guy  with like a blonde perm.  It's hilarious.  Stop it.  Why are they calling you arrogant? 
[01:25:00]  You want this, Jimmy?  Yes, I do.  I'm sorry.  Put it on.  I just made it obvious  that we have to go  for the call.  I didn't mean to do that.  Mark in Hoboken,  what's up?  Why is Jimmy arrogant?  Hello?  Mark.  Hoboken.  Hey.  Who's the fucking car  already, stupid?  Hello, sir.  All right.  This guy sounds, uh...  Hey, sir.  This is arrogant Jim  trying to get you  to focus here.  Mark.  Get the fucking car  out of the way,  you fucking jerk-off.  Is he performing for us?  Are you doing a bit?  Mark. 
[01:25:30]  Are you being wacky?  Oh, motherfucker.  You're being wacky, dude?  What are you doing?  Mark.  We left on Springfield Avenue.  Just hang up on him.  Mark.  Go to someone else  who thinks I'm arrogant.  I'm sure there's  someone else there.  No, there isn't.  Oh, what an asshole  this guy.  He's doing a bit.  Mark, your bit sucks.  As do you.  All right.  Let me say hi  to Jamie in Virginia.  Jamie.  Hey, I don't know  if you guys noticed,  also on Twitter,  Spike Lee is defending  Jeremy Land  against Floyd Mayweather,  which is kind of odd  because he's usually 
[01:26:00]  pro-black on this.  He's a big Nick fan,  Spike Lee.  Huge, yeah.  But I don't think,  to me,  saying that that's  part of the hype  doesn't take away  from this guy  being a great player  or doing amazing things.  But if it wasn't  part of the hype,  they wouldn't be  showing it in Chinatown.  Yeah.  There is a tie-in  where like,  wow, we don't see  Asian guys doing this  very often.  That doesn't mean  he's not as good  as everyone is saying.  I see what you're saying.  It is absolutely  part of the hype  now that I think about it,  but what is going on  is way bigger 
[01:26:30]  than the racist thing.  Yeah, he's an amazing,  racial angle,  whatever you want to call it.  He's a great player  who came out of nowhere.  That's a huge piece  of the story.  I know a little bit  about basketball.  I grew up with it.  The kid has really  good fundamentals  and he really has skills.  Right.  And I just don't understand  how all these scouts  just didn't notice  this shit.  That's what confuses me.  This isn't the turn  of the century,  meaning like the 19,  well, whenever basketball  started, let's say,  where maybe they didn't  have it all figured out  where a player could come  out of nowhere.  These guys, 
[01:27:00]  they have scouts.  This is all they do  is look at basketball players  and no one noticed  that this kid was this good.  And he's 6'3".  It's not like he's small  because sometimes  that prevents a team  or a scout  from looking at a kid.  Right.  He's 6'3".  That's maybe slightly small.  Slightly, maybe.  But really not going to be  a problem on the court.  But I will say  this is where Mayweather  is kind of an ass.  He's blown off  the skills part.  Right.  That's his problem.  And he's also saying  black players do what he does  every night  and don't get the same praise. 
[01:27:30]  I've got to disagree.  To say that black players  don't get the proper praise  in the NBA,  That's crazy.  It's a little silly, Floyd.  Right.  Really?  Do black players  not get their due  in the NBA?  You've got to relax.  Yeah.  The reason why everyone's...  I've got to say it again  and I apologize.  The reason why everyone  is in on this  is because he came  out of nowhere.  A lot of black players...  I mean, a lot of...  You don't even have to say black.  A lot of...  Just about 99.9%  of the NBA players...  Are black. 
[01:28:00]  Are black  and don't come out of nowhere.  They don't come out of nowhere.  I've got to keep stressing that.  And right,  there was no hype  around LeBron James  while he was still  in high school.  Right.  Like, what are you talking about?  And he didn't come out of nowhere.  Like, they knew who...  Most people that know basketball  knew LeBron James  when he was about  15 to 16 years old.  They already knew him.  That's all.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's...  You're right.  He's not concentrated.  It's like,  I think he got it half right.  A lot more hype  because he's Asian  but to say that black players  don't get the same praise  is simply nonsense. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  Almost every player  in the NBA  who is praised  is black.  Last athlete  to come out of nowhere  according to Jimmy James  in New Hampshire,  Tom Brady.  This doesn't happen  a lot in sports.  Tebow.  Tebow didn't come out of nowhere.  What?  Oh, that's right.  College.  That's right.  Everyone knew Tebow  in college.  He was a great college quarterback  but they just weren't sure  his skills were,  you know,  going to translate  to the NFL game.  That's what that problem was.  And then he's proven  everyone wrong  but it still doesn't make sense 
[01:29:00]  because he doesn't really  put up, you know,  the numbers  for the hype.  But he won.  He won a lot of games  for the Broncos.  Let's go to Queen Elizabeth.  We were going to go to break  but now, man,  we got the people  talking out there.  Oh, shit.  I like the Queen Elizabeth  on Twitter.  How are you, Queen?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello.  I was just calling  about the Chris Brown thing.  Sherry Shepard  from The View.  The one who doesn't understand  that the world  is not flat.  Right. 
[01:29:30]  She was going on  defending how he's  a role model  because he took  responsibility  and, like,  for kids.  And I'm like,  really?  He had to take  responsibility.  He was arrested.  Yeah.  You know, like...  And then he broke a window  at Good Morning America.  I guess that's  taking responsibility.  And you got to look  at the source.  I will say  that Sherry Shepard  is the dumbest  broad on TV.  I'm serious.  And I don't even know  who comes in second.  Almost to the point 
[01:30:00]  of retardation.  She is dumb.  I don't know why  they allow her  on that view.  That's why.  Because she's that stupid.  Yeah, and I was tweeting  all the Team Breezies  yesterday,  and they are so  painfully dumb.  One didn't even  understand sarcasm  when I retweeted.  I pulled in Anthony  and I retweeted  what she wrote,  and then I added  something else,  and she didn't even  realize that I added  something derogatory  and retweeted  and was like,  oh, thanks. 
[01:30:30]  Thanks for your support.  And I'm like,  really?  Well, we got the clip  from The View.  Oh, good.  Sherry Shepard.  Hold on a line there,  there, Queen Elizabeth,  with an S instead of a Z,  so you get some  followers today.  Yeah.  All right, let's hear this.  Sherry,  I know that you've seen  some of these tweets.  What's your opinion?  Yeah, you know,  it seemed like he was  very warmly embraced  by the Grammys,  but what concerned me  was a few of the tweets  that some girls put out.  I think we got them.  I don't have,  but let me see.  Oh, gosh,  some people put out tweets 
[01:31:00]  that Chris Brown  can beat me all he wants to.  I'd do anything to have him.  Oh, my.  That was typical.  That was another dude,  Chris Brown can punch me  in the face as much  as he wants to,  just as long as he kisses it.  Then somebody else,  they did tweet,  it makes me sick  that if you can sing  like Chris Brown,  you can beat women  half to death  and other women  will still love you.  So that was a rebuttal.  That concerned me  about these women,  you know,  putting out these kind of tweets  because I've defended Chris Brown  and said that I thought  he deserved another chance.  I still do think  he deserves another chance.  We shouldn't just,  you know, 
[01:31:30]  throw him out  because of one mistake  and just it's over.  Pause.  One mistake.  He almost killed a bitch.  Punching a bitch  ain't one mistake.  Holy fuck.  Wake up,  Sherry Shepard.  That's something  that goes on and on.  It wasn't like  he didn't pay  parking tickets or something.  Unbelievable.  I can't believe  that was the first time  he beat her.  I don't know  if it was or not.  I'll say this though.  Somebody tweeted me  that Glenn Campbell broke,  I want to say  Tanya Tucker's jaw.  Yeah, Tanya Tucker.  And you know,  Sean Connery  has had a lot  of domestic violence things.  So it's like,  eh.  I'll slap a bitch. 
[01:32:00]  It does happen  to a lot of people  who continue.  So it's like,  I don't want to see  the guy's life ruined  if he really did  turn himself around.  But he still seems  like a dick.  Although as a woman,  if you're going to get slapped,  I'd rather be slapped  by Sean Connery.  You know what?  But giving someone  another chance,  fine.  But he just doesn't seem  like fucking sorry  about what he did.  Give him another chance,  but don't hold him up  like he's a role model.  Like if your daughter  brought him home,  I'm sure they wouldn't  be thrilled. 
[01:32:30]  I've never had the feeling  that Chris Brown  feels bad about what he did.  No, he doesn't.  That's I think  the problem  with most of the people.  You know,  yeah, okay,  give someone  a second chance,  sure.  Yeah.  But this guy  has a little temper tantrum  over at Good Morning America  broke a window.  Yeah, he's real sorry.  Right.  He's an asshole.  All right.  Thank you, Elizabeth.  All right, goodbye.  You want the rest  of that clip?  Oh, yeah,  I want to hear  this fucking idiot.  One mistake  and just it's over.  But these girls,  I think these girls, 
[01:33:00]  it concerns me  even more than Chris Brown.  It's deeper  of your self-worth.  What do you think  you're worth?  Either A,  you've been in this situation  and it's not bothering you  or B,  you've never been in this situation  and you don't understand  what it feels like  to get punched in the face.  Well,  I agree you should be hard  on women to like  rev up and get some esteem,  but also I think  it's interesting  to kind of go  be so loose  on Chris Brown  at the same time,  right?  So we have,  I think if two things  can happen at one.  Do you think we're  being loose on Chris Brown?  No, I think so.  I think you're loose. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, look,  if it was your daughter,  I don't think you'd be,  you know what I mean,  I don't think you'd be saying.  So it didn't,  was it Chris Brown himself  who said that he thought  that he should,  because he's reformed  or whatever,  that he should be  considered a role model?  He said if you,  you know,  you've moved past  your mistakes,  you could be.  Now,  what is the role model?  A role model,  you know,  a person who's a kid  who may be an A student  who's doing well,  may need a different  type of role model.  Chris Brown may not  be his role model,  but there may be a child  in a situation 
[01:34:00]  of going through abuse.  That's what Chris Brown  has gone through.  His mother was abused  right in front of his very eyes  six years before  this happened to Rihanna.  He used to wet his pants  from the fear.  He was a victim.  He became an offender.  He did what the courts  told him to do.  He went to 152 weeks  a year of abuse,  domestic prevention,  counseling.  If you got a child  in that situation,  you may see Chris Brown  as a role model.  Role models are different  people to different folks.  He is to different folks.  You know what?  And I hope that 
[01:34:30]  these young women  realize that this is  probably not the right  way to tweet.  You like Chris Brown,  make it about you  like Chris Brown.  Bad jokes about  getting punched in the face.  If you've never been punched,  you don't know  what you're talking about.  So just adjust yourself.  I don't hate what you said.  No, I don't either,  because different role models  are different for different people.  It's almost like  what she's really saying  is if you grow up  in the fucking ghetto  in a bad situation.  You have a great excuse then,  right?  No, no, no.  If you've watched that 
[01:35:00]  your whole life,  and then you see a guy  like Chris Brown  who did it,  and then comes out  and says,  look,  don't do that.  I fucked up  and changed your life.  That is much more  of a role model  for a guy  growing up in that situation  than some guy  who gets A's in school  who's just not a tangible...  I understand  that there's different...  People serve as role models  for different reasons.  But more of the story's  coming out,  which makes it  way more horrific  than we initially thought.  So that's why people are...  So if you pistol whip somebody  instead of shoot them, 
[01:35:30]  you're a role model  to somebody  that would shoot somebody.  It just seems to me  that that was an excuse  for him.  No, no, no.  Not if you do that.  It depends on what you do after.  Like, if you come out  and if...  Again, it's a big if.  You say what I did was wrong,  was fucked up,  I shouldn't have done it,  and you complete  whatever counseling  you're supposed to complete,  and then you move on  with your life  in a decent way.  If that happens,  then you're a role model  to a guy  who is likely to...  Who has pistol whip somebody  who thinks that's the only way  he's ever going to live.  He can go,  you know what?  Alright,  there is a way to fuck him. 
[01:36:00]  I think if you pound  the shit out of a woman's face  like that,  it's just,  you have some kind of  deep-seated thing in you  that just can't go away.  If you ever had the ability  to do that,  you're fucked up.  Man, I've been in that situation  where I haven't done it.  Did you do it?  No, but I was sober.  See?  But I was sober.  Like, I don't know  if he was sober or not,  and I know I sound like  I'm backtracking  what I said before,  but I've been so angry  at a woman  who is inciting it 
[01:36:30]  that I've wanted  to punch her in the face,  and what kept me  from doing it,  what kept me  from doing it  was the fact  that I am sober  and I had that barricade.  Like, thank God  I had that.  Yeah.  If I had a few drinks  or if I didn't have sobriety,  like, I don't know, man.  No, I don't know.  I just see it as  him fucking  being a piece of shit.  He's a piece of shit.  I strongly feel  he would do it again.  Maybe.  He might.  I don't think 
[01:37:00]  he's reformed.  I don't either.  I'm not saying  he is either.  That's the only reason  I can kind of see  what she's saying  is valid,  even if it's not  in his case.  Sometimes if you're  fucked up and you're not...  It's like,  how many guys  come out of prison  and are considered  role models  don't do what I did?  There's a lot  of reformed convicts  who actually go out  and speak  and go on these tours  and they murdered people.  Sure.  And I guess  we're not past this  because of all  the new details.  Yeah.  That's why this is hot again.  And to your point,  you know,  the Grammy people  certainly must have 
[01:37:30]  known the details  of this.  Oh, yeah.  Hell yeah,  they know.  They must have been  in a tough fucking position.  He lip syncs anyway, man.  Does he?  Oh, no.  When he performs.  That's even worse  than beating.  Where's his talent, Sam?  Come on.  He's a good dancer.  Who cares?  Is he?  People like dance.  That's a talent.  No, it's not.  Dancing's not a talent?  No.  Okay.  Name one dancer.  Chris Brown?  No.  In the pros. 
[01:38:00]  That chick who was in here  with Chris Jericho  from Dancing with the Stars?  That's the best you could do.  That chick.  Michael Jackson?  No.  He wasn't in the pros.  What's the pros?  Dancing pros.  You can't name one.  I didn't know there was a...  They have a whole league  and everything.  I don't watch sports.  Someone is saying,  according to an article...  You know what?  Fuck.  This bothers me.  Will, go ahead.  Yeah, going back to Jeremy Lin real quick. 
[01:38:30]  I read an article a couple days ago online  stating that they interviewed  his high school coach,  Jeremy Lin's high school coach,  and he blatantly says  that all the scouts  coming to the high school  from colleges  would just overlook him  based on the fact  that he was Asian  and they would go ahead  and pay more attention  to the black basketball athletes  that were less capable  than women.  This is his high school coach speaking.  I would have to read the article  because that's hard to believe  because when you get  an international player, 
[01:39:00]  it just brings that whole nation  into your...  Whether it's your college program,  they're going to be interested in it,  or your pro team.  Yeah, I don't...  From a marketing standpoint...  Dude, because of Jeremy Lin,  every Asian in the world,  not just in New York,  wants to fucking...  That are interested in sports  are going to be watching  the Knicks now.  That's massive business  for the Knicks.  Somebody tweeted...  I've got a couple tweets on this too.  Jeremy Lin scored more points 
[01:39:30]  in his first five games  as a starter  than any NBA player  has ever scored  in their first five games.  So no one is saying  that this guy  isn't extremely skilled  or doesn't deserve  the attention he's getting.  There's a difference  between saying all this hype  is because he's Asian  and a part of it.  There's a huge difference.  It's like...  Because Asian people  wouldn't take interest  if he was just another black guy  playing a great game at all.  You got all the Asians  because of that, certainly.  Because of that.  But the sports people  understand that this is just  a special thing  that came out of nowhere. 
[01:40:00]  I'm more interested  because he's Asian.  Are you?  I think it's cool to...  Yeah, because I think it's cool.  I love the fact that Tiger Woods  was a black guy  doing in golf  what most black guys  weren't doing in golf.  I love the fact  that an Asian guy  is kicking ass on the court  when you don't see that very often.  It's just something different.  And he did it right.  He's doing it legitimately  and it's through his skill.  I like seeing it.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to find that oracle, Will.  Thank you.  Yep.  All right.  Who's got time for a kiss?  No kidding.  Whoa.  I do.  Let's...  Oh, boy. 
[01:40:30]  Awkward.  D-Rock, just hit anything.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Jimmy left the show.  He's had it.  He's out of here.  So it's me and Anne, I guess.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, that was it.  That's how it ended.  Jimmy's like, I've had it.  That was it? 
[01:41:00]  I'm out of here.  That was it, sir.  Walking Dead guy, Andrew Lincoln,  coming in in about an hour from right now.  Yeah, it was...  I didn't know he was English.  Is he English?  He's one of those actors  that pull off that American thing.  Wow, really?  And then they come in and they're like,  hello.  Hello.  I don't get that.  Hip, hip, cheerio.  Walking Dead, eh?  Because then we do the English accent  and everyone laughs at us.  Like, no, that's not an English accent.  I know.  Then how do we look at the guy 
[01:41:30]  and go, wow, that's an American...  An American?  Yeah.  You know how to say an American accent?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't either.  What else is going on?  It's crazy.  What else is going on?  Oh, man.  Nothing much in a day.  You know?  I'm like...  I'm really sorting through it  and it's like,  I slept pretty good.  I know.  And then he was on Twitter last night  just fucking off  watching some more hoarders  and other fucking idiots  that I just can't get enough of. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know why I continue to watch something  that I get so angry with.  The hoarders just are angering.  This woman, she had chronic fatigue syndrome.  And I was joking last week  about the woman that,  you know,  I have fibromyalgia.  And this other pig,  she's got...  What's chronic fatigue?  It's when you're sleepy  and you're weak,  but the doctors don't know why,  so they just call it  chronic fatigue syndrome. 
[01:42:30]  And she's like,  it upsets me  because I can't, you know,  move around the house,  so I just throw things around.  Oh, really?  Is that how it happens?  If I sat one of those people down,  you would learn this.  They don't drink enough water  and they eat like shit.  Yes.  And they probably have apnea too,  so they're probably not getting  the proper sleep at night  when they do lay down.  I don't believe in that  chronic fatigue thing.  No.  Oh, well.  I really don't.  I dated a girl with chronic fatigue.  She was just bored with you, Sam.  Yeah.  Sam dated a girl with chronic fatigue? 
[01:43:00]  She was talking,  he was talking,  she would yawn.  What happened?  Wait a minute.  Didn't you say you just  dated black chicks?  Being children of the 80s.  Oh, boy.  Officially,  all three of us  are children of the 80s.  We didn't have chronic fatigue  growing up.  And he's wrong.  She smoked chronic  and had fatigue afterwards.  Yep, yep.  She liked the Snoop Doggy dog.  No, I,  so this woman was all like,  she couldn't do anything,  or that was her excuse.  Whenever they're laying  in a pile of shit  and cat shit and garbage, 
[01:43:30]  it's always some fucking hazy  kind of medical problem  that keeps them  from keeping  their own place clean.  But boy,  they could get up  and run  when someone's trying  to throw away  a fucking tin,  a coffee tin  from fucking 1990s.  Are you saying  that fatigue goes away  real quickly?  Oh, yeah.  They start running.  They're going through my stuff.  They're throwing away  my treasures.  It's garbage,  you creep.  Let's ask Sam. 
[01:44:00]  Chronic fatigue,  do you believe it?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Why?  Because some ex had it.  Get over it.  It exists.  I mean, what is it?  Shut up.  I'm tired all the time.  I don't call it chronic fatigue.  I call this show  an alcohol.  It's not being sleepy.  You don't fall asleep  with chronic fatigue.  What is it?  What is it?  What is this shit?  It's when,  it's similar to fibromyalgia.  Exactly.  Fuck fibromyalgia.  Yes.  Right in its butt.  If you actually have it. 
[01:44:30]  I'm listening, Sam.  Okay.  If you actually have  chronic fatigue.  Isn't this great?  It's not great.  You have to eat  the right foods.  Otherwise,  you don't have energy.  You collapse.  Like you literally.  Oh, really?  Like every person.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, if you don't eat,  you collapse.  That's, oh,  what a medical problem.  You know what the cure is?  Food.  Not if you,  I didn't say if you don't eat.  Iraq will never get that.  Like if you eat carbohydrates.  He eats all the time.  Because it's a short burst of energy.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  It wears off quickly  and you'll end up  to the point where you can't walk.  Oh, yeah.  What's the medical shit behind that?  What's the cause?  I don't know,  but I've seen.  Oh, I don't think they know what it is.  It's all vague.  What are you talking about?  You didn't describe chronic fatigue.  You just described eating shitty.  Yes.  It's not eating shitty.  Everyone knows  if you have a plate of pasta,  you're going to have a boost energy.  But if you're not eating correctly  all the time,  then sure.  If you have pasta for dinner,  will you be able to walk around  20 minutes later  without worrying about collapsing  on the floor? 
[01:45:30]  Like, will you be able to move?  Oh, boy.  What?  Yes, it would probably be the answer.  Well, that's what happens  when you don't have chronic fatigue.  It's a way to get disability,  and it's a way to keep from  having any responsibility  of doing anything.  Cleaning your house,  it's a built-in fucking excuse.  Yeah, why are we giving  all these people excuses?  Why are we labeling  a whole bunch of things  that they could go,  yep, I got that.  Chronic fatigue.  Get off your ass.  Well, I think a lot of people  use it as an excuse,  but I saw this person 
[01:46:00]  collapse in my garage  and collapse down my stairs.  She wanted attention.  Exactly.  She collapsed on a concrete floor.  You're picking weird girls  to go out with.  Probably diabetic or something.  Your dad was probably  drugging her and fucking her.  Your dad would say  the world's greatest treat  he'd slip her a Mickey.  Put a roofie  in that fucking buttermilk.  Did you ever hear your dad  and your parents argue  and they would think  you were at home  and he'd go,  you just don't fuck  like a black broad.  He would yell that at your mom.  Sam comes running in 
[01:46:30]  and every time the father  has to say,  no, she just spilt buttermilk  on her face.  Yeah, that's why  he ate buttermilk.  It was a cover-up  because he was drugging  and sodomizing  all your girlfriends  and they would have  buttermilk on their hineys.  How'd they get buttermilk  in their ass crack, yeah.  You'd go out with a girl  that would just fall down?  She collapsed,  like in high school,  she collapsed out of her desk.  Of course,  everybody noticed her.  She sucks.  Was she anorexic?  No, not at all.  So she wanted attention.  She couldn't stand up.  Oh, stop it. 
[01:47:00]  Just stop it.  You don't believe that,  no.  We come from  different generations.  I can't buy into  a lot of this stuff.  I saw it.  I mean,  it's not a matter of...  Yeah, but you're a part  of that generation  where everyone gets  a trophy shit.  I don't know about trophies.  We have to take care  of everybody.  You saw it,  but yeah,  people see it  because they do it.  And I'm not even saying  that all the time  it's this calculated,  oh, I'm going to fall down  right now.  It's some kind  of mental thing.  You want to talk  to a doctor?  It's mental.  And not the doctor?  We go with Liz today.  A female doctor.  Ooh, I like female doctors. 
[01:47:30]  Let's do that.  Hi, Liz.  Hi, how are you?  All right.  Hello.  I was hoping  for a sexier voice.  I'm doing okay.  What's up, Liz?  I'm sorry.  Well, chronic fatigue  is pretty rare,  but it is associated  with a virus  called Epstein-Barr virus.  Oh, we heard  about Epstein-Barr,  another fake fucking thing.  I used to drink there.  At the Epstein-Barr.  With Juan Epstein  at the bar.  Go ahead.  You keep talking.  Go ahead.  I will keep talking.  It is a real virus. 
[01:48:00]  It's really rare, though.  Real, true chronic fatigue  is rare.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone seems to know.  Fibromyalgia is real as well.  You can check Piter's foot.  It's an autoimmune disorder.  But, again,  those people are known  as the biggest pain in the ass  in your practice  that you've ever had.  Because they fucking whine.  And they complain.  They don't do anything.  Oh, I wish I could do this,  but my fibromyalgia. 
[01:48:30]  We call it a comorbidity  with a psychiatric problem.  You always find a psychiatric problem  with those people.  You do, right?  Called laziness.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  And they're all fat.  Boy, they got the energy  to chew, don't they?  Hey, we got it.  Hold on, Liz.  We got a doctor in Chicago  that wants in on this, too.  So we got two doctors.  I just wanted to show the world  that we have doctors.  Yeah.  We have smart doctors.  I don't even know if Jim...  I love your show.  Of course you do.  Stay there, Liz.  We got Jim,  another doctor in Chicago. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, how are you guys doing?  Hey.  Yeah, no,  some of my health  and chronic fatigue syndrome  is just a...  It's a disease of entitlement.  Man, I mean,  if you go to sub-Saharan Africa,  they don't have these problems.  That's what I'm thinking.  You have better things  to worry about  if you're trying to survive.  Yeah, no, I mean,  and the whole...  Meaning you could cure  your own fucking illness, basically.  Yep.  Or learn how to live with it.  Word.  Why can't we learn  how to live with shit in America?  We probably don't survive  in sub-Saharan Africa.  They survive, Sam. 
[01:49:30]  That's right.  Everybody wants doctors  and everybody  to save them  from this stuff.  And if we fail,  then they just give up.  Yes.  I love your cooking show,  Ms. Childs.  Sorry.  Sorry, Ms. Childs.  If you look at  social economic status  and unemployment  and public assistance,  the percentage of those patients  or those people  these, quote,  diseases skyrocket, right?  So how often do you see  a CEO  or a guy  that has a real job 
[01:50:00]  and a family  and is happy with his wife  that starts complaining  about his fibromyalgia?  Oh, I know.  And it's like  when someone comes  in your office  with that form,  oh, no,  you're going to hear  that whole story.  What's the story?  The story is  I need this disability  because I have this pain  over here  and it's like,  you see me?  I'm at work.  I go to work every day.  I have a headache. 
[01:50:30]  I have a backache.  I don't look for a disability.  I don't know about you,  but I can listen to doctors  talk all day long.  Just back and forth.  Do you both concur?  Do you concur?  Are they talking shop  on our radio show?  I concur.  So what I want to point out  is that  most of these diseases  are also created,  you know,  are fostered or whatever  by the fucking drug companies.  Oh, it's the drug companies again.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's true.  They're evil.  We do have another opinion. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah?  If you want,  my doctor,  Dr. Chipperson says,  Dr. Chipperson,  oh, I want to talk to him.  It's fibromyalgia,  but if you have it,  it's fibro-your-algia.  Ah, Chip.  Yuck.  All right.  They're too smart  to play into your chip.  All right,  I got to go.  Jim, thank you.  Oh, you're welcome.  Liz, thank you.  The guy in Chicago's wife  has had fibromyalgia for years. 
[01:51:30]  Had it for years.  You want to hear this?  Yeah.  Scotty, Chicago.  Hey.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Are we big in Chicago?  I need to know.  I need to know right now.  What's that?  Are we big in Chicago?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm driving this traffic.  Yeah, I'm driving an AT wheeler.  It's always fun.  But, no,  my wife had it for years.  Isn't this great?  I like these pigs on hoarders.  My wife doesn't use it as a crush. 
[01:52:00]  She's productive in spite of it  and chooses to keep a positive attitude.  And she's very upbeat and positive,  doesn't whine about it.  She deals with it.  She wakes up every morning,  her muscles...  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  Who is this achy bitch?  Who is this achy bitch?  Who is this achy bitch?  It must be a drag to go out with an achy bitch. 
[01:52:30]  She's just always achy and tired.  Who is this bitch always getting joint pains?  Could you imagine?  This is the point I want to make today  because there are a bunch of generations  represented in studio,  out there in Radioland.  Can you imagine growing up  and telling your mom or dad  that you had chronic fatigue syndrome?  Oh, my God.  They would fucking beat the shit out of you.  Can you imagine me telling my father,  Dad, I think I have chronic fatigue syndrome,  fibromyalgia.  What the fuck?  What is that, a faggot disease? 
[01:53:00]  We wouldn't be able to get away with that.  We had to turn our backyard into a farm.  I mean, you know.  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't be able to get away with that.  No.  You'd probably walk around without falling down, though.  Oh, please.  Did you really just fall down?  No.  And what?  You as the boyfriend had to be like,  oh, my God, you're all right?  You're okay?  Well, the first time.  Oh, what can I do?  Oh, my God.  You think it was showboating?  Oh, God.  Of course.  But then eventually it was like,  oh, again.  Like, it wasn't a big deal 
[01:53:30]  after the first couple.  Yeah.  It shows what kind of character you got.  You blew off that bitch, right?  Well, I mean, I dated her.  You couldn't deal with the falling down shit, huh?  I dated her for like three, four years.  Yeah.  Who is this bitch always falling down,  tripping on her tootsies?  You know how many times,  but we had plans,  and we had to break them  because she couldn't get out of bed.  Because she didn't have the fucking moral courage  to tell you she didn't want to go to a wrestling event.  I wasn't wrestling.  That's probably why she was falling down.  She was taking bumps at all the wrestling shows. 
[01:54:00]  How annoyed were you when you were supposed to do something  and she's laying there like a lump in bed?  Like a fucking tree stump?  How old is she?  She's my age.  Ah, but when was this?  Like your early 20s?  Yeah, like 18, 19, 20.  You're too young to be in bed.  What a lump.  Come on.  I'm not buying that.  Sorry, Sam.  I mean, you don't have to,  but I started to fall down the stairs.  Why would somebody just fall down the stairs?  For attention.  For attention.  Yeah.  She was getting plenty of attention.  Exactly.  I saw my mom throw herself down the stairs once.  Ew. 
[01:54:30]  Pretty impressive.  Oh, but it wasn't fibromyalgia?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You haven't lived until you see your mom  throw herself down a flight of stairs.  It's crazy.  Wow.  Wow.  That's so weird.  Wow.  Why did she do it?  I don't remember anymore.  That goes way back.  Like you saw her launch herself down the stairs?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It was impressive.  Did she jump, or did she just kind of just fall forward?  She kind of slipped and then just went with it.  She went with it?  Yeah.  Oh, this is what we're doing. 
[01:55:00]  You know when you slip, you can kind of like go,  you know what, I'm going to fucking do everything I can.  Or you could just go with it.  She just went with it.  Oh, she went with it.  All right.  Does she want attention, you think?  Oh, yeah.  Did she get hurt?  I don't remember.  Wow.  Did you, uh, with this chick you had,  Yeah.  Was it always like when you were fucking her,  was she just like, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Was it pain all the time?  No, because she wasn't in like, she wasn't achy like fibromyalgia.  Then what was it?  You're saying she's not tired?  She's not achy?  What the fuck?  She doesn't have energy.  She can't. 
[01:55:30]  She wasn't eating right.  She ate, I saw her eat.  Who has energy?  She wasn't eating right.  We're all fucking tired and lazy around here.  You need protein in your diet.  She didn't have the energy to walk.  Give the bitch a Mars bar.  She didn't have the energy to sit upright.  Why would you deal with this?  The energy to sit upright?  What, would a head bobble like an infant?  I told you, she'd be sitting at a desk in high school  and literally she collapsed out of desks.  And you didn't notice this when you were thinking,  You know what, I might take this girl. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, well, that's a catch.  I like this chick.  She might pass out and I could rub my dick on her mouth.  Obviously it was other things.  Other aspects of her personality.  Oh, yeah.  Big boobs, huh?  You're a boob man.  They were big.  So that protected her from a lot of the falls, I would assume.  Building cushions.  You'd think.  Yeah.  Jesus.  But still, you don't want to walk around falling down all the time.  How many times do you see her fall down?  A lot.  Oh, my God.  I mean, what's a lot?  I don't know.  I mean, it's a small empty space next to a building. 
[01:56:30]  I went out with an anorexic chick and I just thought she was really thin.  Yeah.  And the first time I realized, holy shit, this girl pukes up food after I feed her.  I was out of there.  Who wants to deal with that?  It's like, because it's not her fault.  It's not like it's a psychological.  But when you're like young and dating, maybe I understand when you get a little older and  stuff and shit happens.  But when you're really young, you don't want to deal with all that crap.  No.  I mean, in hindsight, it was not something I should have dealt with.  But I'm like, really?  You're going to puke up my red lobster fucking dinner that I just spent money on? 
[01:57:00]  I just bought that for you.  That was it for us.  You were mad about the money that was spent on the dinner.  Well, when she comes out of the bathroom with watery eyes, I'm like, really?  You were.  It wasn't the emotion.  I was making no money, Sam.  You know, it was a big deal to go to a restaurant back when I was in my, when was I?  Like 20, 21.  And she's puking up the food.  And her dumb vomit breath, which they conceal with her serts.  I had a girl blow me one time and I smelled puke in the air. 
[01:57:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  She's a puker.  Oh, she was a fucking, uh, stick the fingers down there?  Yeah, she probably vomited before she came over.  That's good.  She had a serts on the car ride.  Yeah, you wonder why nobody wants to kiss you.  Fucking cherry Coke breath.  Good job, puker.  I think, unfortunately, there's a lot of guys, and maybe women, too.  I don't know that side of the equation, certainly.  But a lot of guys that feel like they could save someone and make it better.  Yeah.  I can't deal with that.  I saw that my whole fucking life growing up. 
[01:58:00]  A lot of wanting to help in me.  I think I did that a little bit, to be honest with you, if I was going to be honest.  But I fucking moved on from that shit.  Fuck that.  I can't make it better.  How long were you with her again?  Like three or four years.  Three or four years of her just fucking ragdolling around you?  Yeah, well.  Fucking going out with a raggedy hand.  Then you realize she needed a wheelchair.  She was crippled.  We had to bring her in a wheelchair a couple of times.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Yes, yes.  Ew.  And you were dating a wheelchair girl? 
[01:58:30]  Not like she wasn't confined to a wheelchair.  Oh, my God.  What an attention whore.  Oh, definitely.  But like she would say.  He still feels for her.  Oh, yeah.  He's still pining for her.  He doesn't want to realize what an ass he was to be tricked into just pulling this  lazy attention whore around.  Did you feel stuck?  Like, you realized a month in, like, holy shit, this girl's got issues and she's falling  down a lot?  No.  But it took you three years to move on?  I cared very much for her.  So how did it end?  Yeah.  Well, this was the same girl I was talking about on the after show before where... 
[01:59:00]  I don't listen to that shit.  Exactly.  You don't talk about, like, it's pop culture commonality.  Well, obviously, it was on, you know, the after show.  You listen to it.  All right.  Maybe we'd have forced to.  When E-Rock was talking about trying to set up a three-way with all the girls that he  goes out with, I said the closest that I had ever come to that was a girl that I was  dating saying, I'm kind of attracted to girls, and me being like, okay, and then her being  like, so we have to take a break so I can go hook up with a girl. 
[01:59:30]  I was like, oh, fuck, okay.  And then, like, a week later, she called me to tell me she had indeed hooked up with  a guy.  Oh, a guy!  I was like, what the fuck?  And that was the end of the relationship?  Which is pretty much just a girl with a cock and no tits.  She didn't what?  That's how she put it, right?  She didn't end the relationship.  I ended the relationship.  Wait, she cheated on you?  You were such a bore in the sack that she had to take a break and you'll fuck someone.  You dealt with this girl falling down all the time and then she ends up cheating on  you?  It was a workaround cheat, but I felt that way. 
[02:00:00]  Fuck, of course.  You should hate her guts.  I did at the time.  You still should.  I don't anymore.  Lazy whore.  You should have said, didn't you realize how many times I saved you from breaking your  stupid neck because you can't keep your fucking self-standing right?  I did feel that way at the time.  Hatred.  Did you curse her out?  Yeah, I remember.  I was in college at the time, so I had to do it over the phone, which is even worse.  But yeah, I remember throwing things and getting very angry at that period of my life, but I 
[02:00:30]  mean, I don't know.  What did she say?  Sorry?  No, she said we were on a break.  You knew I needed it.  We were on a break.  I was like, this is, that's what I was like, are you guys fucking kidding me?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, this isn't at all what was discussed.  Yeah.  It was a week later, too.  Yeah, she was a pig.  I hope you, you should have said something messy about a fibrologic.  I hope you fall in front of a train and your fucking legs get cut off.  And your fucking legs get, you know what? 
[02:01:00]  That's so mean.  That's a great idea, though.  Why would you add in the leg?  Yeah.  I hope your fucking dead toes get caught in the escalator.  But that's a great idea.  What?  We can prove if this shit is real or not.  We get one of these chronic fatigue bitches that falls all the time and put them on the  train tracks and see if they move now.  Yeah, see if they can get their ass up and fucking move.  And the problem is that you don't know, like, you can use it as an excuse, but you can't  call somebody on it when they legitimately have it, because if you've seen them fall down  and then they're like, yeah, I can't go, I can't get out of bed or I'm going to fall 
[02:01:30]  down, you can't be like bullshit because they were like, remember, maybe she was fucking  someone the whole time and that was her excuse because that guy was coming over.  Exactly.  No, because I would go over to her house and just hang out with her at her house then.  She was a lazy lump.  Well, she's in bed?  Yeah, she wasn't sleeping.  What, would you get a chair next to the bed?  No, I would get in the bed and we'd watch.  Oh, just sitting like a visit, like you're visiting Nana in the hospital.  Because you guys can't leave the house because she can't leave, ah.  We'd watch her.  You're crazy.  Do you hate her?  I hate her.  We'd watch a movie at the crib instead of going out. 
[02:02:00]  I hate her, but this is like, if I was thinking about my old self, I did a few of that shit.  I wouldn't do this anymore.  No, I know.  You'd move on eventually.  I went out with an anorexic and a bulimic.  I went the other way.  Ugh.  Wait, bulimic is the one that gains a lot of weight?  Bulimic is one that pukes.  Anorexic is one that just doesn't fucking eat.  So the one that puked up the Red Lobster dinner was a bulimic?  But she was anorexic, too, because she barely ate, and then when she ate, she puked. 
[02:02:30]  So she had both of them.  Maybe it was just because she had eaten a Red Lobster.  It's not exactly a four-star restaurant.  She had food poisoning.  Yeah, she had her hopes up.  She wanted to go to Wawa.  Hey, man.  I went there before the blacks took over.  I went there before the blacks took over that restaurant.  There was a time.  Being a child of the 80s, that used to be a fucking place to go, Sam.  And I could only imagine.  And then what's the one where they eat a lot, but they don't gain weight, but then all  of a sudden you, I don't know.  Ate. 
[02:03:00]  There's a part two to the story.  Then all of a sudden, let's say they leave college, and they come back six months later,  and they're as big as that fucking doorway.  What disease is that?  What's that disease?  Because that happened to me, too.  A girl comes running down Main Street, Geneseo, all excited to see me, and hugs me.  I can't get my arms around her.  And then I realized, holy shit, I was sort of seeing this girl eight months ago.  That's awful.  She got that big.  That's horrible.  That I didn't even recognize her.  That's not fair.  So is that someone curing their bulimia? 
[02:03:30]  I hope you told her.  Did you go, piggy, piggy, oink, oink.  Piggy, piggy, oink, oink.  She came back for, I don't know, a weekend or something.  I was just nice to her.  It makes dealing with normal people so easy when you have to deal with people like that.  I got to ask you something also.  What is she doing now?  Uh, I know she's, she ended up going to a real college for a little while.  Because first she had to go to community college.  No, I mean, is she, is she now walking around and everything? 
[02:04:00]  I don't think she's, I don't think she's in the active workforce anymore.  Falling down stage?  Anymore.  Oh.  No, no.  I think she's still dealing with it.  I think.  But I don't talk to her very much.  I don't buy it.  I don't either.  I mean, I saw her fall down.  I'm exhausted.  Yeah, but you don't fall down.  It's not a matter of like, she needed to sleep more.  Friday and Saturday nights, I fall down a lot.  Passing out, it's different.  Yeah.  Well.  But like, but she'd fall down like a lump.  Like, you could tell when a person's falling down voluntarily and their body just gives way.  What injuries did she ever suffer from falling down? 
[02:04:30]  I'm not sure.  Exactly.  I don't think she suffered any.  Really?  Oh, yeah, she did.  Yeah, she did.  She cracked her rib once.  Big deal.  She tripped.  Yeah, she cracked the rib because she fell.  She's probably eating it.  Well, this is very controversial because you got people out there that, you know, believe  that a lot of these new diseases are real.  And then some old school people like ourselves, like we didn't grow up with a lot of this stuff.  Well, the problem is, I think that they are rare.  And so there are a few people that actually have them.  And then there are a lot more people that just have some of the symptoms that aren't really  that big of a deal and use it as an excuse, like the hoarders people. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  I think.  But I mean.  A guy dated a girl exactly like Sam.  That's what I'm saying.  Meaning she was a fucking incompetent radio person.  Jay in Atlanta.  Hey.  Hey, Jay, you're going to see Jim Norton.  He's going to be in Atlanta.  They're leaving today, matter of fact.  Fuck yeah.  That's very sincere sounding.  Where is it at again?  The Punchline.  Punchline in Atlanta.  Tomorrow, Saturday.  You have a show tonight?  Yeah.  I know where that's at. 
[02:05:30]  But you're here right now.  How does that work?  I leave right after, go to the airport, and then do my Thursday show tonight.  Very confusing.  I'm very busy.  Jay, go ahead.  In a nice area.  What?  What, Jay?  I said the Punchline.  It's in a nice area.  Of course it is.  Jimmy doesn't go to shitty places.  That's right.  We assume that already.  Oh, yeah?  Is it reasonable?  Yeah.  It's reasonable.  It's reasonable.  All right, but whatever, but this girl that I dated was exactly like what Sam was talking  about.  She's always like, oh, I'm tired, or she can't fucking do things. 
[02:06:00]  She can't get up.  So, like, early classes were hard for her to take because of whatever.  I don't know.  I got kind of sick of it, really, myself.  It's annoying, right?  It's very draining.  Yeah.  Very draining.  But you're too young to deal with that.  I know.  Like, I understand.  I'm going to say, I'm repeating myself a lot today, but whatever.  Like, when you get older, you know, shit happens, and you got to deal with more, maybe.  But when you're young and full of fucking cum, why would you pick a chick that's falling 
[02:06:30]  down all the time?  My parents liked her as a person, but I think they were always annoyed that I had to deal  with any of that at that age.  Dude, I blew off a girl because she had a smelly pussy.  I'm like, I don't need to deal with that, and I kind of liked her.  That's a shit reason, man.  Fucking walking around like a marionette.  How the fuck do you go out with?  I had feelings for her at the time.  Oh, God.  But you're too young to get all caught up in that shit.  What are you, one of these savior people?  Do you look at someone, and you're like, ah, I'm going to save her.  At that time, I thought that I could be somebody in her life that could really help her. 
[02:07:00]  I think.  God.  What a douchebag.  Help her why?  Why don't you stop it?  Because she kept falling down.  Exactly.  Get her a medical alert button.  Was it a turn-on to you that she fell down a lot, which meant you were more powerful or  something?  No, not at all.  Did you ever play wrestling with her, like you had knocked her down, like you were Bob  Backlund?  Oh, you know, I just want to knock this girl down again, and she's going to get right  back up.  Did you at least role-play with the shit? 
[02:07:30]  No.  Make believe she's, like, you know, paralyzed?  Yeah.  No.  I'll be a police officer, and you be a girl who isn't a lazy lump of shit.  She's a very smart girl.  Hard worker.  She wasn't a hard worker.  Well, she could be.  Fucking Trips McGillicuddy, her name was.  She wasn't tripping.  She was coordinated.  No, she wasn't.  A lot of people.  Fibromyalgia.  People are mad, man.  They're mad because they got it.  They're like, look, dude. 
[02:08:00]  Put someone on the phone with you.  Shut up.  Mad.  Fucking mad.  The name chronic fatigue syndrome is also horrible because it implies that you're fatigued.  Like, to be fatigued is to just, like, oh, I could use a nap.  Fatigued.  Fatigued is just living in this world we have.  Right.  Like, I'm fatigued because I wake up early.  Sure.  Bill in Georgia.  We have a communique from Dr. Steve on what Sam's girlfriend had.  I'd love to.  She might have had a hypokalemic periodic paralysis. 
[02:08:30]  It's a condition in which a person has episodes of muscle weakness and sometimes severe paralysis.  So she may have had that.  It's congenital, which means, of course, she's present from birth.  Yeah.  And it's passed down through families.  And so maybe she had that.  Could.  I mean, she never went through paralysis.  I said she didn't.  Lazy bitch.  Thank you very much.  Call her.  You're on the air.  Okay.  We got Bill in Georgia. 
[02:09:00]  Bill, are you close to Atlanta?  Because that's where Jimmy's going to be starting tonight.  You know what?  Like, all I know is that I've had chronic fatigue fatigue.  Or make believe I didn't fucking talk.  Or do that.  Or do that.  He's got chronic fatigue.  Or make believe I didn't just ask you a question to make it a little more personal.  Give him a break.  I'm sorry, but I'll get to that point because I've had a fatigue.  Oh, really?  You're going to get to this right about now.  Yeah, it's chronic fatigue.  Don't hang up on him.  That's what you're going to get to.  The poor boy might be asleep now.  I can't dial the phone again because my fingers are exhausted. 
[02:09:30]  They don't need naps.  They don't need more sleep.  Oh, it's all about naps.  People with chronic fatigue do not have apnea.  They do not need to go to sleep.  Look at Sam.  Somebody tweeted something funny.  Any chance Rihanna has chronic fatigue and just fell down a lot on her day?  Yeah.  Sam is still pining away.  You sure you want to get mad?  Yeah, you better check yourself.  You should make sure this is what you want.  I'm not pining at all.  I don't know.  You're pining for the bitch that falls down a lot. 
[02:10:00]  Wait, do you think the black girl had the excuse?  It was just an excuse to not be seen with Sam.  Yo, let's go to the dance.  No, no, no.  I'm not fatigue acting up.  Oh, I'm falling down again.  She always wanted to dance when you wanted to do things in public.  My friends used to get mad because I'd be like, yeah, me and her will come over your  house or we'll go with you.  And then I'd have to call at the last minute.  Oh, she fell down.  She's too tired.  We're going to hang out here.  She fell down.  When I was in Buffalo, but it was an anxiety thing before I knew what anxiety was.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  And I finally had to move on.  I'm like, I can't deal with this.  I'm just a kid trying to make my way in the world.  I mean, I'm very happy I moved on.  And I always had the worst luck with restaurants because I would take her to restaurants in  Buffalo.  And now I'm like, I'm counting my pennies because I'm doing overnights making, seriously, the  number was 14,000 a year.  So every once in a while, I'm like, I think I could handle taking her out to dinner.  And then we're sitting there and we ordered all the food and she goes, I got to go.  I'm like, what do you mean we got to go?  You're how much money I'm spending right now?  This was all I had.  And I didn't understand it because it's this anxiety thing where all of a sudden out of 
[02:11:00]  nowhere, you feel like you're on a roller coaster, that shit.  But I was too young to understand or be able to deal with this.  That's why, I mean, I'm glad that there was something, there were physical symptoms for  me to see.  But why is it always the timing that the anxiety is right at the point when the food  arrives?  That's where I go, come on, how much of this is a me, me, me thing?  I like that all your girls with disorders that you had to deal with, it was all around the  fact that they ruined the dinner that you paid for. 
[02:11:30]  Exactly.  There's always lousy restaurants where I'm actually on their side for that one.  I got to get out of here right now.  This is horrible.  But why didn't they have the anxiety a little sooner before maybe, you know, I could go,  look, sorry, we'll pay for the appetizers.  At least after appetizers.  Here's a couple bucks for the bread and water you brought over.  No, I'm in.  Yeah.  Then they don't understand because she looks completely normal.  She sits there.  Well, that was the thing about the girl I was dating, too.  She was very good looking.  She was very smart.  But everybody thought she was faking.  Everybody was like, that girl doesn't look tired at all. 
[02:12:00]  That girl's faking it.  You go out with any of these broads in?  No.  That shit.  I'm sure Jess is going to get like this thing where Sam's just, hey, could you just sit  in this wheelchair?  No.  You know, yeah, yeah.  Just let me push you around a little.  No, it's fun.  It'll be fun.  It is so easy.  You're an enabler.  It's so easy dating Jess.  Just go get up.  Why?  Because it's like she's just a human being.  Who's just normal human being.  So it's like even her worst problems.  With you, she can't be totally normal.  She's very normal.  Even her worst problems are like, I've been through so much worse. 
[02:12:30]  Like when she wants you to wear condoms?  I don't know.  Because she wants it to feel special again?  I don't know anything about that.  I think there's a little college thing happening too.  I think she wants Sam to wear condoms because maybe she went out and did a little something  and was waiting for test results.  Maybe.  Uh-oh.  I don't think so.  I think Sam's a dud in the sack.  Well, that might be, but I don't think.  You get shit done with your penis or what?  I mean, I try to, but.  Do you slap a girl's face with your cock ever?  No. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  Do you ever say suck it?  No.  I don't think I've ever would say.  What do you say in bed?  I'm obsessed with you.  I'm very quiet.  I know, but how do you.  Thanks, sir.  Thank you so much.  Do you ever put your fingers in a girl's mouth and open her mouth?  No, no, no.  Then shove your cock in?  No.  How do you get a girl to suck your dick then?  I let them do it.  What, do you shrug and point at it?  I would let them do it voluntarily.  Just hope she falls asleep and her mouth hits it.  She collapses.  She's passing out.  Yeah.  They don't pass out.  They don't lose consciousness.  They collapse. 
[02:13:30]  Wait, you don't just shove your dick in a girl's mouth?  No.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I don't know.  I have my own issues, I guess.  You're waiting for an engraved invitation?  How do you eat that pussy?  You just kiss down the stomach gently?  Yeah, it's done with love.  Ugh.  Let's go to Bill in Augusta.  You might remember Bill from earlier, who ignored my fucking question.  All right.  Bill, I'm very sorry.  I should have answered your question.  I am not going to apologize.  You may have apologized and called back. 
[02:14:00]  Well, I want a human experience sometimes with these people.  No, no, no.  You're right.  I can be a radio robot like anybody.  I'm a couple hours away.  I apologize.  That's right.  I just wanted to say, though, that I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years, and I always  hear people telling me about it being a fake thing.  And the thing is, the only thing I have energy to do ever is to go see Jim Norton this weekend  at the Atlanta Function Club.  Yay!  Plug!  I just knew that was coming.  It was just a plug the whole time.  Don't use these stories to give plugs to me.  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Now I feel like an asshole, because you wanted to set that whole thing up earlier, right,  Bill?  Oh, he's gone.  Let's go to a guy who really knows how to use his dick.  That's Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  He's a coxman.  Yeah, he really is.  I've heard.  I'll give a girl a little succinyl of choline, and then rape her while her eyes are open.  He just likes the eye contact.  Yeah.  She looks glazed, like she's watching a horror film, but it's just him leaning in with his  radio voice.  No one's going to believe you. 
[02:15:00]  I'm a pillar in the community.  Dr. Bryce.  Doctor, you know how to use your cock, right?  Oh, absolutely.  I'm a doctor.  Absolutely.  I'm a doctor.  I just want to, you guys have been trashing Sam's girlfriend, and I know what she had,  and it's a genetic disorder, so you guys are trashing a girl with an actual syndrome.  You just made it feel a lot better to trash her.  Thank you.  Whoops. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  She had hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and it's a disorder.  The hallmark of it is people who eat a high-carbohydrate meal and then become paralyzed afterwards.  That's awful.  Isn't this great?  If you eat pretzels, you can't get out of the house fire?  Yep.  Yeah, let's fucking set her house on fire and see if she still can't move.  She had a high-carbohydrate day with not a lot of protein. 
[02:16:00]  Like, she needed protein, like she would say.  That's what your job is a man.  How about you eat the carbohydrates, and then the disease is solved?  Or stick your cock in her mouth for the protein.  It can happen anyway, but that's the hallmark of the disease.  And when I heard that, I knew immediately what she had.  And it's real.  They're literally paralyzed.  And it's often misdiagnosed because it's like one in 100,000 people have this disorder, and a lot of doctors don't know about it.  What do you do for it? 
[02:16:30]  When they have the attack, if you take them to the emergency room, they can give them potassium, and then their paralysis will go away.  But there is a medication called triamterine that bumps up your potassium levels in the cells, and sometimes that will work.  Doesn't bananas do the same thing?  Not really.  I bet you she ate a lot of bananas.  Not Sam's banana, obviously.  We would never before him slapping it in her face.  Sam certainly wasn't squirting his dick juice in her mouth. 
[02:17:00]  Because I didn't shove it in her mouth.  You should have just put it in her mouth like if a baby cries.  You don't ask it.  You shove a pacifier in its mouth.  Every time she yawned, you should have shoved your dick in her cheek.  Here's more protein.  She wasn't yawning.  Here you go, lazy.  She wasn't tired.  Make sure you just go, doctor's orders every time.  That's right.  Doctor's orders.  Dr. Sam here.  She would say if we were out, she's like...  Sam's a weirdo.  I'm not a weirdo.  You eat weird, and you get turned on by girls that fall down.  You don't talk when you fuck.  You talk when you fuck. 
[02:17:30]  You talk, don't you?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a talker.  A little talking going on.  It was an emergency, though.  She'd be like, I need something with protein in it now.  That's exhausting.  It was exhausting.  I've been there now.  But, you know, I'm older now, so I'm way past that shit.  Ooh, bananas are bad for reflux.  Sam's just very nurturing.  I'm a nurturing person.  You're a creep.  I'm not a creep.  Dr. Steve is right.  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, thank you.  It's a short call.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  We gotta go to break.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Take care, buddy.  See you soon, bud.  All right.  Steve.  Bye.  Steve's a good man.  Yes, he is.  We gotta play this thing.  I use man loosely.  Oh.  We might have something for somebody out there next.  Can I say that much?  Sure.  Yeah.  Just don't mention it's Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Don't.  Whatever you do, mention that.  Okay.  Because I don't know.  I really don't.  I know.  You don't know the rules.  Even though it says, big intro for Bruce Springsteen ticket giveaway.  Why would you say it?  Sweeper.  I don't know, though.  Officially, I don't know. 
[02:18:30]  Officially.  Yes.  It might not happen.  And then we got a kid crying over school contest.  Danny's telling me this is really good audio.  So we'll get into that next.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  We got something to play here.  Kid Cries over school contest.  Really good audio. 
[02:19:00]  Let's play this now.  Maybe Roland will be in the studio in a few minutes.  Maybe not.  I don't know.  A teen won a contest to design a sticker honoring Chicago's men and women in uniform.  But now, the city says it won't use the design after all because they think it shows gang signs.  Here is a look at the drawing.  You can see several hands pictured above a heart.  Well, some say those hands are displaying a well-known gang signal.  The devastated teen says that's completely untrue.  And I don't think that's fair. 
[02:19:30]  I try the best I can.  They don't have nothing.  That art design doesn't have nothing to do with no games.  Nothing.  City leaders say they haven't decided whether to let the teen keep the $1,000 bond he won for winning the sticker contest.  I'll just give the kid $1,000.  Can you Google that, Sam?  Honestly, that looks like...  I knew nothing.  It sounds like management when we talk to them.  What's going on with the online feed? 
[02:20:00]  Oh, look at this kid.  Don't be white kid.  The teen says that's completely untrue.  And I don't think that's fair.  I don't think that's fair.  I don't have nothing.  That art design doesn't have nothing to do with no games.  Nothing.  Let me see the hands.  City leaders say they haven't decided.  No, here's what he's doing.  He's trying to give perspective of the hand.  Like when you see a hand and fingers behind it. 
[02:20:30]  Right, right.  That's not gang signs.  That's not gang signs.  He's just not a good artist.  Give him $1,000.  God, what douchebags.  Can you play that again?  Yeah.  This is great.  I've been the best I can.  I don't have nothing.  That art design doesn't have nothing to do with no games.  Nothing.  With no yings.  You know what?  He's more famous now. 
[02:21:00]  Can't they see that this kid's telling the fucking truth, though?  Yeah, of course.  No yings.  Of course.  Hmm.  Andrew Lincoln from The Walking Dead will be in studio.  Yes.  Sooner than later.  Oh, man.  Watch that season finale from last season and then watch the premiere.  I don't know who he is.  It's pretty goddamn good.  Oh, my God.  He's very famous, Jimmy, this guy.  Andrew Lincoln.  Man.  Oh, yeah.  Is there anybody live out there? 
[02:21:30]  It's time to win Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Bruce Springsteen tickets.  It's time to win Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Dial now.  Fucking die.  Sorry.  I get jealous.  All right, Roland.  We're going to give away some Bruce Springsteen tickets, but I got to ask you, where are you  at as far as going to the big Bruce Springsteen show March 9th at the Apollo Theater, courtesy  of SiriusXM?  Well, they said, we know about your love for Bruce.  We're working on it.  So we're still in the working on a stage officially? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And where are we at as far as getting you a picture finally with Bruce Springsteen?  That's all you want.  You'll never ask for another picture from SiriusXM, correct?  Correct.  Um, probably that's further, farther away than the tickets.  It's probably halfway.  The pee-pee's about to touch the asshole, so probably not.  I don't know.  The pee-pee's about what?  It's like, we go, ah, we're working on it.  Oh, it's almost a dick in the ass.  Oh.  It's almost a dick in the ass.  That's Roland's thing, if you don't know. 
[02:22:30]  He likes to talk about how he gets a lot of dicks in his ass.  Yep.  And that's when things are going well.  Yeah.  All right, um, hmm.  See, because I know a lot of these guys on the phone, so I can't, it's not fair.  So someone's got to give me a number.  Six.  Six?  Thank you, Jimmy.  Sure.  Let's go to six.  You got a chance to win the Bruce Springsteen tickets?  I don't even know his name yet.  Who's this?  This is Dave from New Jersey.  Hi, Dave. 
[02:23:00]  Dave, what video?  What's rolling?  Dave's being friendly.  Hi, Dave.  Hey, we want to know about Dave.  Uh, I'm a, I'm a huge Bruce fan, huge O and A fan, so.  How long have you liked Bruce Springsteen?  Um, I went to my first show in 99, and I've been to 56 since then.  In hours.  How many is that in hours?  56.  That's impressive.  Uh, Roland, how many are you up to?  250, whatever.  Oh, yeah, I got nothing on Roland.  I liked him since 86, whatever. 
[02:23:30]  Good luck to this one.  Are you saying 99's a little too late to be getting into Bruce Springsteen, Roland?  Well, 99.  It was a bandwagon, right?  I hope he gets his question, because this is an oldie.  Roland loves this.  He really does.  I'm going down for the connoisseurs.  All right, guys.  For Dave in Jersey.  What video featured both Bruce's first wife and his second wife?  Oh.  Ah.  Two girls, one cup.  I have a pass.  Um, was it, uh, uh, Brilliant Disguise. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, my God.  No!  Ew!  Oh!  I thought we had...  It was Glory Days.  Ah.  She was just the, uh, backup at the time.  And his wife walked into the bar.  His wife was the one, right.  What, uh, what other band's video was his first wife in?  Video.  Oh, I don't know.  Roland?  I know that one.  Roland?  Oh, man! 
[02:24:30]  Come on!  It's like fucking puppies.  Holy shit!  I think I got you.  Was it a Springsteen song?  Probably not, right?  Nope.  She was in a music video, uh, for a band back in the 80s.  Child of the 80s.  Rocka!  What?  It's that first wife.  She was an actress.  I know.  Yeah.  I know it's a band.  I said it wrong.  See if anybody else gets it.  No.  No.  I know the answer.  I don't want to pull it.  No, you don't.  I do.  You really don't. 
[02:25:00]  It was, um, ABBA.  No, I'll give you a hint.  Shitting on a cracker.  Uh, Leonard Skinnerd.  Leonard Skinnerd.  Leonard Skinnerd.  It wasn't Leonard Skinnerd.  That's just a hint.  Oh, 38 Specials.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Dead Eyes.  Hold on Loosely.  Yeah.  38 Special.  I don't know.  It was the one with the horses.  But it was a 38 Special video.  Was it Hold on Loosely?  I don't know.  Let me think.  Hold on Loosely.  What video? 
[02:25:30]  I'm trying to think of the name of the song.  Was it called Frosted Haired Douche?  You are in studio.  Oh, boy.  Awkward.  I thought he was in the other room still.  Ah, you rock.  I forgot my 38 Special songs, eh?  Uh, yeah.  It was 38 Special Song.  I'm going to go Hold on Loosely.  It might have been Hold on Loosely.  Oh, see, guns come up when you put this in the Google.  Uh.  38 Special Band.  All right.  Uh.  All right, sir. 
[02:26:00]  Caught Up in You.  Yes, it was Caught Up in You.  That was the one.  Caught Up in You.  Mm.  38 Special.  Bruce's First Wife.  Was his first?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That didn't last long, did it?  No.  No.  He he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he.  All right, we have another parody.  I guess we've got to get another caller.  All right, Jimmy's picking the numbers today.  11!  We don't...  There's no 11.  It doesn't go to 11.  Minus 5!  It's 6!  We just did 6!  3!  Okay. 
[02:26:30]  Everything is exhausting with this guy.  It can't just be easy ever.  Jeff in New York.  Jeff, good luck.  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  In 1999, Bruce was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Why can't we get to know Jeff before you jump in?  Exactly.  You want to get right to breaking his heart.  Hi, Jeffykins.  Jeff, what are you doing right now, sir?  No, he didn't...  I just listened to the show.  Are you going to work?  I retired. 
[02:27:00]  From what?  I have my own phone company.  Damn, you did pretty well.  Watch your own phone company.  Hello, Mr. Bell.  Yeah.  Very good.  His last name is At.  I was trying to work that in.  I didn't have a good one.  I was going to go with Verizon, which is stupid.  Go ahead, Roland.  Let's see if we can get the tickets to Jeff.  In 1999, Bruce was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Who gave the induction speech? 
[02:27:30]  Devil's Tale.  What?  Devil's Tale.  No, who gave the induction speech?  Gee.  No, that was...  What?  No.  No.  Come on!  It was Bono.  Bono?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why would Bono do that?  Because they're friends.  Because they're friends.  All right.  Back to Jimmy.  We only have one pair today? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  17?  We don't have...  Minus 5 is 12.  Divided by 2 is 6.  No, we didn't say...  Plus 4 is 10!  We don't have 10 right here.  Minus 1 is 9.  All right.  Let's go with 9.  Jesus.  Steve in Philly.  Yes!  Steve, you've got a chance at these Springsteen tickets.  What are you doing in Philly right now?  I am at work.  Has lint fever caught on in Philly? 
[02:28:30]  Oh, I'm so sick of hearing about it.  Well, because the Sixers have a pretty good team this year, too.  Well, I'm tired of hearing about the Sixers, too.  You just don't like basketball.  But...  Nothing means anything right now in basketball, so...  Oh, not a big fan of hoops.  Nah.  Ah, yeah.  All right.  Let's see if we can give these tickets to you for the March 9th show at the Apollo Theater.  All right.  Springsteen signed a record deal with Columbia Records.  What year was it?  Oh, for God's sake.  He's not a happy guy.  Jeez.  Oh, that's the voice of a Googler, by the way, right there. 
[02:29:00]  72.  Because he Googled it.  We don't know that.  Yeah, it sounded like...  It doesn't matter.  There's no...  You are right.  You're right.  Wait.  No way.  You know you're right, because someone gave you the answer in the background.  Which is fine.  It's...  Let me see what I can play for you.  We have a winner.  You like that one?  Why do you like that one? 
[02:29:30]  I don't know.  Leave me that.  It's so easy to make him laugh.  Wow.  Usually when other radio stations do this or whatever, it goes so smoothly and there's excitement.  Yeah.  I'm at work.  I can't really...  What do you do?  Make coffins?  Make satin pillows for...  Or make him scream to get a ticket for...  Come on.  What are you doing at work?  Is this an illegal phone call?  I work for...  Yeah, yes it is.  Really?  Which is why I cannot Google. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Where are you working?  I work at a mortgage company.  Oh, we...  What's the rate at?  Four something?  Oh, I don't do that part of it.  Did you finance the Nagel Mansion?  No, I didn't, but I wonder if we have it.  Ooh.  On the Nagel Estate.  It's in Florida, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he was born and raised in Florida.  He still has Florida roots.  On the grounds of the Nagel Estate. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Let me look it up for you.  Hold on.  I'm looking it up.  Big N on the gate.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  And on a rock.  Big N in the bedroom.  It's N-A-G-L-E.  Yeah.  N-A-G-L-E.  Yes.  N-A-G-L-E.  You can't look up his shit.  What's wrong with you?  Yes, I can.  I'm in the system.  You can Google Eric, but not Bruce.  No, I'm not in Google.  I'm in our system.  It's in Florida, right? 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  Is he jerking off?  Did Russ?  God, really?  Did Russ Meneve win the Bruce Springsteen ticket?  Yeah, he does sound like Russ.  Russ Meneve.  Well, inside, but what the hell?  What happened?  All right, we're going to let you go there, buddy.  Steve, you won the tickets to Springsteen March 9th at the Apollo Theater.  We will all be there.  I'm not going.  Oh, we will.  Some of us will be there.  I will be there.  I don't want to go.  I'll be clapping and talking really loudly to Roland.  No.  I like when Bruce does this song.  That's all I'm going to say. 
[02:31:30]  I'm going to ask a lot of questions.  No.  All right, Steve.  Thanks a lot, man.  Hold on.  All right.  You're welcome.  Should we do a quick break before the Walking Dead guy?  Yeah.  Do you have that or you're going to have to go all the way to 10 o'clock?  Yeah.  I'm up for a break.  Single break.  Roland?  Yeah.  Are you happy?  No.  As far as the contest went today?  I wish he got it wrong.  He sort of did. 
[02:32:00]  I know.  He went 78 and then 72, so technically we could have probably said no.  I heard 78 first.  Look at this.  Two fists.  Is that a real...  That's another Eric Nagel?  Look at this doofus.  Professor Dr. Eric Nagel.  Professor Dr. Eric Nagel?  Yes.  Let's look up our names.  What's he a professor of?  Give me a...  He's in Germany, right? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, he's in Germany.  Yeah, anyone that has my name is...  He looks like a cross between you and Eric Logan.  All right.  Damn.  You rocking the bitches.  Give me Greg Hughes on the Google.  Let's find that fucking doofus Greg Hughes, too.  And then we go Jim Norton.  That's me.  Oh, you said you wanted the doofus Greg Hughes.  Nothing?  Holy shit.  I look horrendous.  I look horrendous. 
[02:33:00]  What the fuck is that?  Let me see.  Where was that taken?  I don't know.  Here.  At a nanotits convention?  That's horrible.  We are hunching over.  You're not supposed...  That's not a natural...  Plus, you can't even see your V in that picture.  V?  Yeah, where the abs meet the pelvis.  Who was that taking?  Oh, my God.  You just depressed the shit out of me.  You wanted me to Google.  Nah, fuck it.  Is that a Greg Hughes? 
[02:33:30]  No.  All right, we should break,  because we got the Walking Dead guy coming in.  Wow.  What the fuck was that?  I found one.  That's another Greg Hughes?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  He's a dork.  He's like a kid toucher.  All right.  When we get back,  Andrew Lincoln from The Walking Dead.  Yes.  So stay right there.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:34:00]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,  Brocks.  Yeah.  We are back.  Look at this.  This is video, people.  Andrew Lincoln coming in.  Where is he?  Is he just around the corner?  Is he in the Bulg?  Is he in the Bulg?  I don't know the show, but you know the show, right?  Oh, yeah.  I've heard of it.  Love it.  It's supposed to be a great show.  Love it. 
[02:34:30]  Effects are great.  It's on AMC.  It's 9 o'clock on Sundays.  It's about zombies, right?  Yeah.  How many seasons is it?  They are in their, I believe this is the third season.  Technically.  The first season was a very short season.  And the second season was your normal season.  That one just ended.  And then we had the premiere of the new season.  And man, man, if you got that one DVR'd, you're going to enjoy it. 
[02:35:00]  Because I love when they do stuff on shows that are just brutal and you don't see it on  other TV shows.  Right.  Because they're just brutal.  Especially when they involve, like, children.  They do that on this?  Oh, boy, do they ever.  I really should watch it because I've heard a lot of good things about it.  I just, I haven't avoided it.  I just haven't seen it yet.  Characters are pretty cool.  They change throughout the show, too.  Because, you know, it would be a pretty drastic situation. 
[02:35:30]  Fucking zombies.  I was having some thoughts about zombies and what the hell's going on.  And I was tweeting last night.  What happens?  Let's say.  Because I see people in all kinds of zombie movies and shows and even on Walking Dead.  They kill a zombie.  And then they're lugging the zombie around and throwing him around and putting him in  a truck.  And then they drive and they throw him on a fire or something like that.  And, like, they're kind of willy-nilly with the zombie.  Now, what happens if his tooth, like, swings? 
[02:36:00]  Like, you got him hanging by his legs and you're going to throw him.  And his tooth nicks your shin and cuts your leg with his tooth.  After he's, you know, re-dead again, you know.  Are you going to be turned into a zombie?  I noticed on the season premiere, the girl was just very okay with just picking up that  Picking up the arm and just tossing it back in.  Well, how does this thing get transferred?  What makes you a zombie?  Is it through blood?  Oh, it's blood.  Yeah.  And that's another thing.  If you have a cut on you, because people are all cut up.  They're battling zombies, for God's sake. 
[02:36:30]  And then they're hitting these zombies over the head with various things.  A little splatter gets on to you.  Blood splatter.  What's the difference if blood splatter gets in an open wound?  I'd be walking around in an outbreak suit.  You should put this on the new website, Things Dorks Say.  I do.  It's called Twitter.  I do it all the time.  I tweet this stuff constantly.  Yeah.  This is great.  You and your friend can wear cloaks and sit around on a Friday night and talk about what-ifs 
[02:37:00]  with zombies.  I'm going to wear a cloak.  Yeah, maybe you hold a flashlight in between you.  What if a zombie was bleeding?  I don't know.  But I don't know the answer to that question.  I would say it's a good question, but it's a very childish question, but I wish I had an  answer for you.  I don't.  The oddest thing is that there is a zombie craze that's going on.  And I know the vampire thing is very attached to the young girl kind of demo.  Sure.  But I think it's like guys have this infatuation with zombies, because I think, you know, secretly 
[02:37:30]  they would love a zombie invasion.  It seems like fun, doesn't it?  Because you're allowed to just hit them with a bat and nobody says anything.  It would be so great just to beat the shit out of these things.  Yeah.  Yeah, and from watching the shows and movies and whatnot, I've realized a lot of people  act like idiots in these, and that's how they get fucked up.  So I honestly don't think, given any of these zombie situations, that I would be fucked up 
[02:38:00]  in there.  I don't know if I would or not, but a zombie...  Laugh at me.  Shut up, you watch-wrestling guy.  Exactly.  You dated a zombie.  They just kind of fall down.  They lay in bed with fibromyalgia.  It was chronic fatigue.  What's that?  It was chronic fatigue.  Whatever it was.  Always sleepy.  What a bum.  She was probably hooking all night.  That's why.  Your girlfriend was out taking loads all night for money, and then she'd see you and kiss  you.  She wasn't sleepy.  We've been over this. 
[02:38:30]  She was sleepy.  No.  She was a lazy bum.  She would not survive a zombie attack.  No?  No, not a chance.  She'd just lay there on like a lump?  Yeah, she'd run away, but then she'd fall down, and then a zombie would...  It's hilarious.  She's like one of those fucking...  One of those sheep that gets scared.  Oh, and then they just...  The fainting sheep.  Fainting goats or whatever.  And their legs just go straight up in the air.  I honestly think I wouldn't make the mistakes that a lot of people made.  I know Zombieland kind of put a thing, the rules.  Yeah.  That was the rules, and double tap is one, where they always shoot the zombie once and 
[02:39:00]  then walk around like everything's hunky-dory.  You gotta shoot the zombie twice, make sure he's dead, crack that head open, because  he winds up getting up and starting to chase you and shit.  What gun would you use?  As far as guns, there's been...  Oh boy, have I gone through Twitter nights with nothing more than just conversing what  guns would be best in a zombie invasion.  I would think shotgun, just because you'd get the most amount of damage, I would think.  Yeah, a shotgun would be very good in closer quarters, though, like inside a place. 
[02:39:30]  Let's say you're at that mall parking lot.  Now you're talking a nice Benelli semi-automatic and M4 shotgun, something like that.  That'd work great.  But if you're in close quarters, I want something very high caliber, something that's going to  really rip that head off, and an automatic, but also a revolver on the side, just in case  it jams.  And would you have to worry about zombie splatter getting on you in case you have open wounds? 
[02:40:00]  Well, that's just it.  I don't know.  I don't know that.  We'd have to get into a zombie thing, and then that would have to be found out through,  you know, trial and error and some other poor motherfucker.  Before we knew if that is the case, I would be more careful than you see these people being.  I've actually written a zombie script.  You did?  Where bullets don't kill the zombie.  The only way to kill them is to flick their genitals with a spork.  You have to flick their genitals with a spork.  It's a whole different element.  A spork? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  And that's how they die?  Yeah, they're so embarrassed that you've shown their zombie penis and their zombie vaginas.  They turn beet red and then they die.  Yeah, they die.  From embarrassment.  They'll get sheepish.  Would you bunker down in a compound, or would you go out?  Hunker down.  You could bunker down.  Okay.  I think you've got to stay on the move, to tell you the truth.  Okay.  I think you've got to stay on the move.  You need a small group with you, let's say.  A lot of scavenging has to go on.  Ammunition is imperative. 
[02:41:00]  I'd say make your way to the gun stores immediately.  That's probably the first place you want to go, are the gun stores, because with a gun and  bullets, you can get anything else you need.  Sure, yeah.  Some poor bastard walking down the street, some anti-gun person walking down the street,  got a fucking, you know, bologna and cheese sandwich.  It's mine now.  Yeah.  Mine, motherfucker.  I'm taking it.  So you would rob from people.  I would fucking do anything it takes.  It's not a matter of humanity coming together.  Don't run into me.  Why not stay in one place and fortify it? 
[02:41:30]  Because it always gets overrun.  Once the amount of zombies, if there's an amount of zombies, they always seem to find  their way in somehow, some way.  And I think if you stay on the move, you have a better chance.  But you'd have to be on the move with multiple firearms on your person.  Well, yeah.  And you don't know where to park?  That's me every day anyway, at home.  How do you know where to park?  What do you mean where to park?  Meaning, how do you know, where the fuck are you going to park for the night and relax?  You go out and take a shit in the middle of the night and a zombie fucking bites your 
[02:42:00]  foot?  No, that's why you do, you're in a war zone, in essence, so you gotta camp, you gotta set  up perimeters, you gotta maybe go from house to house, you gotta assess the area.  Are they thick with the walking dead?  Is it, you know, sparse?  Have you seen a lot of them?  And then you set up some kind of perimeter to warn you?  How would you travel?  By foot?  Automobile?  Or would you get a horse like the guy in the walking dead?  How about a helicopter?  You can't have it in the sky.  Yeah, there's no zombie.  You never saw a zombie on a cloud hit a helicopter. 
[02:42:30]  How come none of these asshole steal helicopters or planes to fly where there are no zombies?  Because there's always zombies somewhere.  Boy, every time they go somewhere, they think there's no zombies.  Zombies.  They just show up.  I would take all kinds of transportation based on the needs.  Now, if you're just local and you're going around looking for supplies and stuff, I think  on foot is fine.  Rough terrain where you need a horse?  Yeah, get the horse.  And then when you're taking a long road trip, you need that vehicle. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, you need a truck or something like that.  The horses would all be dead because no one feeds them.  But they'd be wild.  They'd fucking eat grass.  They would graze.  Yeah, but you're not going to be able to just take a wild horse.  He's probably been running from zombies all day.  He's tired.  Be like Sam's ex-girlfriend.  You jump on him and just collapses.  His legs give in.  Rags a rib.  Yeah, worthless attention horse.  Fucking whinnying like a queer.  Wowee.  I think a lot of the domestic horses would just go out and graze like they do in pastures 
[02:43:30]  or ranches, and they'd be totally fine with you shoving a bit in their mouth.  Is that his girlfriend?  Publicist?  Wow.  No, I hear tell his wife, who he married, is Ian Anderson's daughter.  Oh, from Jethro Tull.  Jethro Tull.  She was sitting on a park bench.  I read that on the internet.  Did you?  Oh, it better be true.  It might not be. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, it better be fucking true.  And this is where your experiences riding horses would come into play.  Yes!  That's a survival of the fittest mentality.  I have been preparing for this my entire existence, and I know it's fake, so that kind  of upsets me.  Yeah, because you've done so much work for this.  But I've done so much work for this.  Well, zombie invasion, home invasion, they both have invasion in it.  Right.  And you can make both fun.  Do you have the same rules for home invaders? 
[02:44:30]  I certainly do.  Double tap.  Double tap.  Never take it for granted.  Barricades.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very similar.  Okay.  No, I think a great weapon is a .45, something that's really going to eliminate the head.  Yeah, and a shotgun.  That's what you have to do, is eliminate the head to be 100% sure.  And who said that?  Who made that rule up?  Because, yeah.  They're dead.  Why does the brain still do something for them?  See, my thing is where there's a big speech at the end. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Where the star says to the zombies, you were once like me.  What has become of you?  Oh, that's good.  And they give the slow clap.  That's good.  At the end of Rocky IV.  You could do one of those speeches.  Look at that.  Yeah, I didn't understand none of you zombies, and you didn't understand me.  That's good.  And then he looks over, and he sees all the zombies are raping Adrian.  Infecting her.  And in the middle of that conversation, look who's here.  How you doing?  Take a seat, sir.  We're alive on the air, as a matter of fact. 
[02:45:30]  Hello.  We like doing that.  Get right to it.  It's Andrew Lincoln, of course.  He plays Sheriff Rick.  Sheriff Rick on The Walking Dead.  I'm a huge fan, man.  And I've, since the first episode, hooked.  It's another one of those shows that, like, and there's been very few of them that you  watch right from the beginning, and you're just like, all right, I'm in.  I'm in.  Well, I'm glad you said that.  I mean, for me as well, it was exactly the same experience.  All right, take the silly voice off.  Come on.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:46:00]  But I haven't seen the show.  Do you speak?  I know.  Have you spoken to Jon Bernthal as well?  You've had him on the show?  Because he said, we just ripped it out of you.  The fact that you're a limey, basically.  You don't sound like that on the show?  No, he sounds like a guy from the South.  No, I do a Southern accent.  You do it very well.  Well, thank you.  And I have my sneaking suspicions.  There's a couple other people in that cast that have English accents.  Who do you think?  I believe the daughter of the farmer.  Good spot.  Yeah, yeah, okay. 
[02:46:30]  Stringer Bell.  All right.  Stringer Bell.  Stringer Bell.  Probably a long show.  No, that was a credit to you, my friend, because I did not even know.  I'm always amazed by that.  I guess a lot of Americans are.  Well, it's such an honor to be able to play American in your country.  And I've got enough to worry about with the zombies.  Yeah, exactly.  Let alone sort of getting a dialect right.  Exactly.  I watched the season premiere just last night.  Had it DVR'd.  And wow. 
[02:47:00]  Just amazing.  And again, The Walking Dead.  And I was saying to Jimmy, one of these shows that are willing to do things that other shows  will not do.  And it gives you those, what I call, and it is subtle, I can say this, holy shit moments  where you're just looking and you're like, what the, no, they didn't just do that.  Oh, that was a brutal scene.  In the barroom scene?  The end of the last season and the beginning of this season, the barn scene.  Oh, yeah.  Where you have to take care of business with Sophia.  Yeah.  Another minor killer. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Another child being killed.  Rick Grimes, constantly, yeah.  Just dispatching the children.  Yes.  And you're so toiled over it.  You're not quite the typical hero guy.  You're very troubled.  You're indecisive a lot of times about things.  You don't come off as this.  He's actually a useless leader.  He's the worst leader.  The worst leader ever.  When will people get wise and go, don't listen to him?  If he says, I guarantee something, never do it. 
[02:48:00]  It's not going to happen that way.  It is odd, though, that this type of hero in a show is not really the kind of hero.  Did you have it pegged as that when you first read for the role?  That's why I liked it.  It's based on this comic book, this hugely successful comic book series.  And I loved it.  He's just an ordinary guy.  Right.  And I read this quote that was really helpful because everyone's going, oh, you're playing this iconic hero.  And it said, a hero is a man who does what he can.  And I loved that. 
[02:48:30]  It's so simple.  And it's just like, he just happens to be the guy that when everybody sort of takes a step back, he's the one left going, oh, right.  Yeah.  You're in the process of elimination.  You're it.  I'm the guy making the call.  And it is.  It's a fascinating.  I love this job.  I mean, I love working down in the South, getting eaten by, you know, chiggers and ticks and all the rest of it.  And the crew are just magnificent.  And it's just a wild show.  It's like nothing I'd ever read before.  It is.  It really is.  And another thing that makes it is, boy, the special effects are insanely good. 
[02:49:00]  How much of it is CGI and how much is makeup?  Well, most of it is makeup.  And that's why we shoot on film.  Because they wanted it to be on Super 16 just so we, there's something tangible about the makeup.  I mean, Greg Nicotero, who's the guy in charge of the team that do the special effects, he's like the Willy Wonka of gore.  I mean, he did this seat in the next episode coming up.  We did this night shoot.  And I called it nose off night. 
[02:49:30]  And there's one, an actor that gets a gut shot from, I'm not going to tell too much.  But basically he went away 20 minutes and then came back.  And we were just all having a coffee while they were setting up the shot.  And he came back without a nose.  And it was like the most extraordinary bit.  But they did it in 20 minutes, these guys.  And it just looked like his nose had been...  It's horrific.  Completely removed.  And we all watched it.  It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.  They're biting his nose off in this scene.  That's great.  So this is season two?  This is season two.  Oh, the first season was short, right? 
[02:50:00]  First season was like a shortened season.  Yeah, we did six.  We did...  Because Frank and...  They just wanted to, like you said, they wanted to establish this extraordinary world.  And if you just did one pilot and then...  They just wanted time for it to kind of...  It was a great idea to do it that way.  Because, yeah, like you said, with one pilot, it could have been a, wow, that was cool.  And then people just kind of forget it.  It gave enough where you got so much character development.  Yeah.  And you got invested in the show.  And it was such a limited amount of episodes.  You just wanted more. 
[02:50:30]  Great.  That was absolutely their intention.  Yeah.  And I know AMC were great at doing that.  They just said, look, have six.  Yep.  There you go.  And, you know, Frank Darabont is just a magnificent director.  Oh, Frank is the one who did...  We had him in.  He did...  Oh, Frank Was Better?  Yeah, Frank Was Better.  He did that Stephen King movie, which...  The Mist?  The Mist.  That's correct.  Yeah, he came in.  He was actually great.  And that was a good movie.  The effects were okay, but he said he worked with a really low budget.  He said he wished he had more money on that budget.  But, yeah, I like him.  He's the best, man. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a fantastic show.  So, have you ever been fascinated with zombies or such over the years?  Not really.  I'm being honest with you.  I mean, because I was talking about this.  It's more of a...  The European sensibility is like vampires, isn't it?  Bram Stoker and all that kind of stuff.  And I was just trying to work it out.  If it's...  I mean, we don't really have...  I mean, of course, I watched the Romeros and the more sort of campy spoof things when 
[02:51:30]  I was a teenager.  But then I didn't really sort of follow it up.  Americans fascinated with zombies.  Yeah.  I don't know what that is.  Thank God.  I think, yeah.  And I think it goes along with what they call our gun culture.  Because Americans, you know, we love our guns.  Yeah.  I've noticed.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I love your guns, frankly.  Guns are fantastic.  And zombies are creatures that you can shoot without repercussions.  That's right.  We can get away with murder.  Literally, yeah.  And we do.  With murder. 
[02:52:00]  And people just seem to like that.  And we were talking before you came in that a lot of people have these kind of zombie contingency  plans.  And even though they're fictional things, people actually have contingency plans for these  things.  By people, I mean me.  Exactly.  Nobody does but you.  Can we hear them?  Well, I've discussed it many times on Twitter and whatnot.  And other people do come on board from the institutions.  I get it because they're mental patients. 
[02:52:30]  No, I just think you need.  Now, you know this just from the show.  You need proper arms.  You need guns.  Yeah.  Guns, very important.  Hugely important.  A bit loud.  You don't want to attract too many of them.  That's true, too.  Silence.  So you need some kind of quieter means to remove the head or remove the brain.  Yeah.  The crossbow seems to work very well if you're good at it.  Yeah.  But I don't know many people that would be that good with the crossbow.  No, I know.  And distance as well.  Yeah, yeah.  But they are sort of reusable as well. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  And I'm looking.  Can I ask a question?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Because I haven't seen the show and I've heard about the show.  Is it you're in one town and they're all coming or are you mobile like we were talking  about being mobile?  Yeah, we're sort of moving around.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And the second season, we have to leave Atlanta because Atlanta's fallen, basically.  Atlanta is where it happens?  Yeah, it's all show.  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton's going to be in Atlanta.  I'm flying there right after the show to do stand-up.  It's going to be terrific.  I hope all the ones that they killed show up to my show and I make bonus.  Oh, okay.  So there you are kind of mobile. 
[02:53:30]  That's cool.  Yeah.  The Atlanta scene was great, too, and that whole thing went down.  Just the big explosion.  Oh, it's madness.  Yeah, yeah.  And insane.  It just looks like you're watching a movie, which is great.  That was the intention.  Yeah.  They wanted the scale and the scope.  They wanted for people to be able to watch it on a DVD set and watch it.  I mean, I know a few people.  My hairdresser, weirdly, just when I watched the whole first season in one go.  Yeah, you could do that because it's like you're watching.  I can't believe I'm mentioning my hairdresser.  Yeah, look at you. 
[02:54:00]  Check me out.  Another one.  That's somebody who's very secure in yourself.  Very glamorous now.  Very comfortable with my hairdresser.  Yeah, you can mention him.  Could you get it on demand?  Because I'll actually, I'll watch it.  I'll just...  Yeah, yeah.  It's fantastic.  You definitely should search it out.  You got it.  The characters, too, are great.  You got some really good actors on there.  And the kid that plays your son is...  He is amazing.  How old is he?  He turned 11 this season.  He's gone from the point of being this little innocent kid to now it's almost hard to watch how cut off he is from any type of emotion. 
[02:54:30]  And just cold and, you know...  We are so, so lucky to have that kid.  I mean, it's a huge part.  But Chandler Riggs is just breathtaking, man.  He's the real deal.  And he...  You know, whenever you're getting a bit like, oh, how am I going to do this scene?  You just kind of listen to the kid.  And he's just seamless.  How long did it take you guys to shoot a season? 
[02:55:00]  Because when you looked at Lost, they had the kid who played Walt.  And he was very good.  But then it took him a long time to shoot a season, so he grew.  How long did you guys shoot for a season?  It's the same sort of thing.  We do five months for a season.  And, you know, he's a growing lad.  I had to carry him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  For two weeks.  And, you know, I was trying to drag him away from craft service going...  Yeah.  And she saw...  I literally...  I was crawling to the bathroom.  And I was like...  And I came...  And she said, what the hell happened? 
[02:55:30]  I went, Chandler Riggs.  I was just...  And I said, when's my action figure coming out?  Has he got a crawl mode?  Do you know what I mean?  When a couple...  Like two weeks and he's going to be bigger.  And then a month he'll be bigger.  So I guess the carrying scene's...  Yeah.  That's about it, huh?  No, but he is...  We're so blessed to have him.  And he's wiser than his years.  He's like...  He's a 30-year-old trapped in a kid's body.  It really is.  He's done a great job of changing...  All of you guys have done a really good job of just slowly changing  the character.  That's got to be tough, too. 
[02:56:00]  You can't just go into it going, oh, this is who this person is.  Because...  What's his name?  Your partner there.  Yeah.  John.  Who plays Sean.  John Bernthal.  Who plays Shane.  Yeah.  He's gone on a huge journey.  He went, like, completely batshit.  But it's a great storyline.  And he stood up my wife.  Yes.  Yes, he did.  Well, they thought he was dead.  Yeah.  Well, two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  She didn't wait long to start fucking, did she?  No.  Something tells me there was a few problems in the marriage.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Satellite's fantastic.  Something tells me there was some problems in the marriage beforehand.  There was.  Okay.  Okay.  I think, you know, you were taking that job a little more serious than the marriage.  In a zombie world...  Oh, I love the show.  It's fantastic.  In a zombie world, you probably fuck quicker.  Because you know that you could be killed very quickly.  So the grieving process is probably shorter.  It could be, Jim.  Instead of waiting a year, it's like, all right, he's dead.  He's still warm.  He sped up a little bit.  Yeah.  I imagine that's the way it is.  Wait till you watch it.  I really want... 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Because I'd heard so many things about it.  I think John might be a bit upset if you said that to him.  Yeah.  Well, if she had sex with him two weeks after she thought you were dead, that is an inappropriately  short amount of time.  However, in a zombie culture, in a zombie world, anything goes.  It could be dead tomorrow in that world.  Did you live in the States when you auditioned for it?  Were you already here acting?  No, I was in London.  How did they go...  Did they go through a whole bunch of rounds of auditions here and not find what they want  and say, look, we have to start looking over in Europe? 
[02:57:30]  I think that I was attached to a film and my son was born a little bit early.  And so I pulled out of this film.  And so up until that point, I hadn't read any of these scripts.  They need some medical equipment to save his son, who has been accidentally shot.  And they go to this place to get this gear.  And as they're leaving, they're just overrun by these zombies.  So they're trying to outrun him.  And this Otis guy's a little rotund. 
[02:58:00]  He's having a little bit of a tough time.  And Shane has the medical equipment.  And he looks and just pops Otis in the leg.  Otis goes down.  Shane continues running.  And the zombies just...  He used him as bait.  That's...  Well, you know what?  Just to fucking get away.  Let's be honest.  He was probably tired of looking at fat Otis.  Just lumping around the camp.  I don't blame him one bit.  I didn't either.  Because when it happened, instead of going, oh, poor Otis, everyone went, yes, what a great idea. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, that's right.  You know?  So times like that, you take it in the context of this zombie overridden world and say, you know, he's doing what he needs to do.  In the episode premiere, you and the bar with those two strangers that came in, that was badass, by the way.  I know.  Do you watch those?  I don't.  No, I don't watch myself.  You don't watch yourself?  No.  Have you seen the episodes or no?  No, I don't watch myself.  Oh, I don't either.  Just watch that scene.  No, no, no.  You know how badass you look? 
[02:59:00]  I lived it.  I lived it.  You whipped around.  Yeah, itchy trigger finger.  Boom, boom, behind you.  And then you got to polish the guy off in the noggin.  God, it was great.  I know.  Why don't you watch yourself?  Like, don't you, aren't you curious, like, what take they might...  I mean, I kind of understand why you wouldn't.  But like, say they do a couple different takes.  Are you ever curious as to how it finally came out?  No, I just enjoy the acting part.  Are you self-conscious?  Wow.  Yeah, I think...  Well, what happened is that I've been working for sort of 18 years, and the first five years,  you watch yourself, and you sort of go, oh, I like it when I do that. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, I look kind of sexy when I do that.  And then you start getting, or certainly I did, I started sort of going, stopping myself  and being really, you know...  You don't want to turn into the Fonz.  Well, do you know what I mean?  You were thinking of how it was going to look.  You become very directorial.  It's a real problem.  You see lots of people become pastiches of themselves.  You know, they turn into a caricature of their own performances.  And I just decided that I would get myself out of the equation and just thought, I love  just doing the acting side. 
[03:00:00]  And let's not censor.  Damn, that...  Are you a good listener when you act?  I'm obsessed with this when I talk to, like, real actors, because it's so hard to listen  when you're acting.  That is absolutely...  That's all it is.  It's reacting.  My acting coach has said, that's it.  You've got to listen and react.  Jimmy, you've got to listen and react.  Yeah.  Huh?  A little bit quicker, hopefully.  So you don't watch yourself?  I'm always late.  Like, I come back...  I always ruin scenes by coming in late. 
[03:00:30]  I'm fascinated with that.  Although I did do a French film, and I speak very, very little French.  You know, I speak sort of chalet French.  I can order a baguette, you know.  And I just found myself being in scenes waiting for people to finish.  You know what I mean?  It's the worst acting I've ever done.  Your turn, my turn.  Your turn, my turn.  Okay, they want me to speak now.  So wait, you actually spoke in French?  Yeah.  That's got to be difficult.  It was the most terrifying thing I have ever done.  And then I did it again.  Do you know one of your lines? 
[03:01:00]  Can you say one of your lines that you remember?  No.  I can't remember.  Did you actually take French to do it, or no?  No, I sort of learned it phonetically.  Wow, how the hell do you do that?  Yeah, it was crazy.  It's crazy, yeah.  Yeah, it was.  It was stupid.  And I kept phoning people back home going, why am I doing this to myself?  How good are you?  This fucking guy gets a movie in a language that he can't speak.  I can't get cast in a commercial here for tampons.  That's a great actor, man.  That is a great actor.  That's hilarious. 
[03:01:30]  Wow, that is fast.  Well, they're telling us in our ears that we have to rap you because you have other press.  Andrew is a busy, busy man as far as this show goes.  I've loved talking to you guys, and thank you for watching the show, man.  I'd love to have you on again.  Yeah, anytime.  I'm a huge fan of the show.  It's fantastic.  It's obviously The Walking Dead Sundays on AMC at 9 p.m.  This season, I mean, from the premiere there, it's shaping up to be amazing.  I love the show.  Thank you so much.  The next time you're here, I will be caught up on this series because I really want to see it. 
[03:02:00]  And good luck in Atlanta as well.  I'm sure it's going to be terrific.  Just me and six fucking bored people in a room watching me tap dance for an hour and ten minutes like a zilch.  All right, everybody.  I guess any plugs?  Atlanta tonight, tomorrow, Saturday at the Punchline, and then next weekend I'm at the Fort Lauderdale Improv.  And have a great, safe trip.  I won't see you till you're back.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, you're not here tomorrow.  I am, though.  So everybody else, we'll see you tomorrow again.  Andrew, thank you so much. 
[03:02:30]  It's a pleasure.  It's very cool. </pre>
