<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from Chicago, celebrating its one-year anniversary at 115 Bourbon Street in Marionette Park, was a raucous affair featuring a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, Danny, Dr. Gay (Travis), and E-Rock (Troy Kwan was absent).  The pre-show involved audience participation contests including "Worst Breath in Chicago" ($500 prize), "Oddest Thing You Own" ($1000 prize), and a "Chip off the Old Block" Chip Chipperson impersonation contest.  Audience members showcased bizarre possessions (one in a concerning insulated bag) and competed for the "worst breath," with Sam Roberts interacting with and ribbing the other show members and the audience.  The arrival of Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton marked the start of the main show, met with enthusiastic audience cheering.

The main show continued with audience interaction, characterized by crude jokes, sexually suggestive comments, and offensive remarks targeting various groups.  The hosts engaged in conversations with audience members of varying degrees of sobriety, ranging from tales of stealing church musical equipment and rough casino experiences to personal anecdotes.  A recurring element was the "bad breath contest," judged by E-Rock, featuring contestants with increasingly foul breath, culminating in one contestant causing E-Rock to vomit, which was subsequently consumed by another contestant.  This was followed by the "Oddest Thing You Own" contest, which showcased a disturbing array of items including a Pat Boone metal CD, a kangaroo scrotum keychain, a human skull, a Wookiee book, a WWII prophylactic kit, a dog skull (with details of its removal), and a shoe claimed to be from a 9/11 victim. The authenticity of several items was debated throughout the show.  A separate contest for the "largest vagina" was also announced, offering a $300 prize and semen on the shoe.

A significant part of the show was dedicated to a guest appearance by CM Punk, who participated in conversations and even weighed in via text message on the authenticity of some of the items presented in the "Oddest Thing" contest.  Another notable guest appearance was by animator Coke Logic, a long-time contributor to the show, who received a Chip Chipperson hat.  A man who postponed brain surgery to attend the show also made a surprise appearance.  Throughout the broadcast, Jim Norton contributed numerous farts.  The show featured a significant amount of profanity, sexually explicit content, and offensive jokes targeting various groups.

A segment called "Rich Voss Quiz" featured Rich Voss, a guest in studio, taking a fifth-grade level pop quiz. This segment incorporated reminiscing about high school, including embarrassing anecdotes about Rich's personal hygiene, social life, and bullying experiences.  The conversation touched upon Rich's dating preferences, views on relationships, and his struggles with the quiz.  The quiz itself generated comedic moments due to Rich's incorrect answers and explanations.

Numerous phone calls from listeners were interspersed with banter between Opie, Anthony, Rich Voss, and Jim Jefferies, who was revealed to be in the green room. A recurring theme was a listener claiming a 141 IQ, which the hosts doubted, leading to jokes about his intelligence and past business ventures involving "dealing drugs."  The hosts offered a $1000 reward for an IQ test performed on air if the caller came within 10 points of his claimed score.  Discussions included WWII anecdotes, Jim Jefferies' comedic style, and a past incident where he might have been punched on stage. The show ended with discussions about awkward childhood experiences, including anxieties and first sexual encounters.  The "Oddest Thing You Own" contest concluded with the WWII prophylactic kit winning the $1000 prize.  Ben, a large overweight contest participant, almost had his shirt forcibly removed by Sam Roberts for $100.  The broadcast concluded with thanks to sponsors and guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, my name is Erock, good to have you here with us, Erock  Radio on Twitter if you want to follow me, or the Opie and Anthony Show on Facebook, 
[00:00:30]  Opie, A-N-D, Anthony, and then of course they have Twitters, Opie Radio, Anthony Cumia,  Jim Norton, make sure you follow all those, oh and Club Soda Kenny on Facebook, he gets  upset when I don't promote his stuff.  Anyway, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony, and in today's show, I'm looking back, it's  the one year anniversary of us doing our live show in Chicago, actually it was earlier in  the week, but it was on the weekend, and it didn't seem right to play it on Monday, it  seemed more of a Friday type show, so that's what I'm going to do here for you right now. 
[00:01:00]  This is our show when we were live in Chicago back on August 10th, 2012, it starts off with  Sam Roberts pre-show, and then goes into the whole Opie and Anthony Show live from Chicago.  I hope you enjoy it, it's many segments, and maybe you remember some of this stuff, if  you happen to be out there, if not, maybe you listen to it on the radio, if not, maybe  this is the first time for you, and if not, then you don't care who gives a shit, here  it is, Opie and Anthony live in Chicago.  All right, here's what's going on, the Opie and Anthony Show goes live from Chicago in  just 30 minutes. 
[00:01:30]  This is after Opie and Anthony live, before Opie and Anthony, live from Chicago.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Let me hear you, Chicago!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show, well, this is the pre-show, live at 115 Bourbon  Street, that's not the address, that's the name of the location, here in Chicago, Illinois. 
[00:02:00]  How is Chicago doing?  It's a very awkward intro, because we couldn't hear the actual intro that played, that you  at home, there was a radio intro that played, that nobody, so they were just cheering.  And I had to tell them all to shut up for a second, but now you're allowed to cheer as  much as you want!  I hope you're all prepared for the greatest live show probably Chicago has ever seen. 
[00:02:30]  We have a lot planned for today, and we have a lot of people here.  First of all, we're going to be doing Chip off the old block.  How many people are excited about Chip off the old block?  We've got some booze.  Chip.  Some guys, and the drinking has commenced here.  Oh, yes.  At the pre-show for the Opie and Anthony Show live in Chicago, there's a man in the front  row who's bragging about his tooth.  Not yet, not yet.  Not yet, he's a, not yet, sir.  You'll be all right.  We do also have security here! 
[00:03:00]  Security is here!  Thank God for all of us, yes.  But Chip off the old block is, of course, the contest where you, the audience, get to do  Chip impressions.  Does anybody have a Chip look?  Did people come with looks for Chip?  Yeah!  Chip outfits, that's your look?  You have one?  Yeah!  There are a couple Chip outfits here.  How many of you are here to compete in the Worst Breath in Chicago contest?  Just the one guy.  Nobody, we're giving away $500 to the Worst Breath in Chicago.  Nobody has faith in their breath. 
[00:03:30]  You do, and you, no, no, no, no on the stage, mister.  You have bad breath.  A lot of people have bad breath, and we have a special judge for that, but we'll get to  him in just a minute.  How about this?  $1,000 for the oddest thing you own.  Who's got very odd things?  And more importantly, who's excited about seeing odd things?  Yes!  We all are!  Now, you may or may not know, but I was able, what, what is that coming from?  I blame Danny for that. 
[00:04:00]  That was probably your mic.  I've been in Chicago for over 24 hours.  There was some trial and tribulation, but I made it here on Thursday!  That's right.  Not everybody made it here on Thursday, though.  So there is some question as to how many members of the Opie and Anthony show are actually  here in Chicago.  Why don't we introduce some of them first?  Well, he's on stage right now.  Danny, why don't you say hello? 
[00:04:30]  This is Danny Russ.  Hello, Chicago!  How are you doing?  You all know Danny.  He does the how much bits.  He does all this stuff.  All that stuff.  Danny, you were in Chicago last night as well.  I was.  Whoa!  Whoa!  I guess that mic wasn't on before.  How are you liking Chicago so far?  I love Chicago.  Yeah?  And I don't say that just because we're here, because we went to Cleveland and that place  is god-awful.  Yeah, it is.  Chicago's awesome so far.  That's right.  This guy here says, fuck Cleveland.  Are we saying, fuck Cleveland? 
[00:05:00]  That's right.  That's right.  We're not in Cleveland, so fuck them.  Fuck them.  Now, by the way, E-Rock earlier this week got some guff on the air because he badly wanted  to see the Married with Children fountain that's here in Chicago.  Let me ask you this.  Danny, you got here last night.  You haven't had a lot of time.  No, not a lot.  Have you gotten to do anything here in Chicago?  I got to have some dinner last night.  Oh, great, great, great.  Good food in Chicago?  Is there good food?  Yeah! 
[00:05:30]  I hear that you guys make pizzas.  I had some free hotel breakfast.  You had free hotel breakfast.  Only in Chicago is your breakfast free.  And then directly following, I went to the Married with Children fountain.  Oh, you went to the Married with Children fountain yesterday.  Of course.  Of course I did.  I did the Bundy pose.  Yeah.  There he is.  The Bundy pose.  You have to.  Well, Danny's not the only person here because a young man who some of you may know as Travis,  but most of you know as Dr. Gay is here.  Can we sing a song for him? 
[00:06:00]  They call him Dr. Gay.  That's fine.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  There he is.  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  I'm really glad this bitch's sticking around.  Now, as if we didn't need enough evidence, well, you didn't realize when we were talking,  because Travis also got here yesterday.  He was here since Thursday.  What we didn't realize until we got here to the venue today was that the reason Danny  and Travis could both travel on Thursday is because they're staying in the same hotel room 
[00:06:30]  and dressing each other.  Very nice plaid shirt.  Short sleeve.  And hang on a second.  The only reason that you're not wearing yours is because you saw that we both ended up dressing  the same.  Yeah, we ended up throwing it out backstage.  You have one as well.  I did bring a plaid shirt because I didn't know if I would want to wear it.  I saw Danny and Travis.  That's why Sammy Sam is dressed like a schlub today.  And I made the decision I did not want to wear it.  Thank you very much.  Do I look handsome or what?  Mixed reaction on that one.  Yeah, lukewarm.  Mixed reaction.  Well, you know, Danny and Travis are not the only people here because you all, the live 
[00:07:00]  crowd got to hear it.  I really wish the radio audience had heard it.  They did not hear what you heard about seven minutes ago.  And that was a great crowd booster because what you want to do is get the live crowd  amped up and let them know that the live programming that they're here to see is about to start.  And they got a hell of an intro from a guy who got here only a few hours ago.  He just got here this morning, but he made it here.  And that man who did the startlingly good intro is Roland. 
[00:07:30]  Roland, you did a fabulous job intro-ing everybody.  Thanks.  How are you doing?  Don't worry about him.  Worry about me.  A lot of distractions here.  What Roland doesn't realize is that even though there are a lot of wonderful Chicagoans here  in the crowd today, I'm the one you want to focus on.  Just me.  I know.  So how did you like it being on stage all by yourself to introduce this great broadcast? 
[00:08:00]  I did not like it.  You didn't.  No, I hated it.  Did you guys notice his voice cracking a couple times?  Yeah.  When I see the old people, it cracks.  Yeah.  Well, why don't you just do a big plug.  Let everybody know where they are.  They're here.  What show is coming up?  Because Roland, I'm just telling you now, the hosts are about less than 10 minutes away.  They're on their way.  But don't pretend you're...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:08:30]  That wasn't the announcement.  That was me telling Roland.  What I need Roland to do with that information is you let the crowd know.  I'll get off your stage, Roland.  Let the crowd know what's coming.  Let them know, Roland.  They're not focused on you, Roland.  You've got to make sure that they're focused on you.  Command their attention.  This is your crowd.  Are you Roland's crowd?  All right, Roland, you got them now. 
[00:09:00]  Let them know.  Let them know, Roland.  Oh, ONA.  All right, they're trying to catch.  ONA is two minutes out.  Go ahead, go ahead.  No, say it again.  They don't even know what you said.  You're mumbling.  Oh, ONA are about two minutes out.  I'm here for Roland.  I'm here for Roland.  Roland also.  I wanted to say this.  Roland, don't leave just yet.  We're at 115 Bourbon Street. 
[00:09:30]  It's a bar and restaurant here.  They treated us very well.  We got to sample some of their food.  I found out earlier they make wonderful chicken tenders.  And Roland found out that the entire right side of the menu is also wonderful.  It's very delicious.  I just had a sampling of it.  Roland decided, after he had a nice free hotel breakfast,  he decided to come here before a live broadcast  and have Chicago favorites jambalaya, chili, and buffalo wings for lunch. 
[00:10:00]  It's a good lunch.  It was delicious.  It was delicious.  It was delicious.  It was delicious.  Well, thank you very much, Roland.  Some of the people in the crowd are asking to see Roland's shit.  Miss, do you also want to see Roland's shit?  Shit?  Sure.  His excrement.  Why not?  They want to see your shit, Roland.  So later on in the broadcast, if you do defecate, make sure you save it  and you share it with these great people.  Thank you very much, Roland, everybody.  Roland. 
[00:10:30]  Now, there was a lot of questions.  Oh, also, I don't want him.  He might get mad if I don't introduce him.  He was a big part of the show this week.  Everybody give a hand for Gary.  Gary's here.  Gary.  Come on, no.  You're kidding me.  You're booing.  You're kidding me.  Why would you boo him?  Why would you boo him?  Didn't you notice?  Excuse me.  Didn't you notice?  He's wearing a Blackhawk shirt.  Why would you boo him? 
[00:11:00]  It's Gary, everybody.  Oh, that's incredible.  Oh, you guys are unbelievable.  Well, we haven't introduced everybody yet.  Because a lot of, if you remember, how many of you listened to yesterday's show?  You were listening yesterday.  You listen every morning, right?  That's what I like to hear.  Now, there was some question about flights.  E-Rock and Troy Kwan is what was questionable because they were told to go to the airport bright and early.  And if you remember, E-Rock said, well, he said he wasn't going to go to the airport early, but you knew he was going to go because he's not a badass like he pretends to be. 
[00:11:30]  But, Troy Kwan, on the other hand, said, I'll get there when I get there.  And so there's been a lot of questions as to who would make it to Chicago because the weather in New York hasn't been great.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Troy Kwan isn't here.  He's not here.  What are you cheering for?  He's gone.  He's not here.  He didn't make it.  No, he didn't make it at all.  He didn't get on his plane.  Not whatsoever.  He's back in New York looking for a party. 
[00:12:00]  Troy Kwan is not here.  I'd like to apologize to all the ladies that showed up for Troy Kwan.  I heard he was getting too old for this shit.  Yeah, he said.  That's the thing.  He said traveling is just wearing on him.  He's not like he was when he was a young man.  But, E-Rock, the sex bagel nagel, he was supposed to leave around the same time as Troy Kwan.  E-Rock is also scheduled to be the guest judge of today's worst breath in Chicago contest. 
[00:12:30]  Do you think E-Rock made it?  Yes.  Do you think E-Rock is the type of guy to do what needs to be done for the show?  Yes.  Well, let's find out.  Is the sex bagel here?  Thanks, Steve.  Open that door.  Is the sex bagel here?  It's the sex bagel.  It's the sex bagel.  I don't believe it.  He made it.  He made it.  The sex bagel is here.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  They love you. 
[00:13:00]  E-Rock.  Listen to that.  Grab that from Danny.  He's got a mic for you.  You don't take my mic.  This is my show.  The mic doesn't leave you.  What's up, Chicago?  What's up, Chicago?  He wants to know.  I don't know how you do it, Sam.  Day in, day out.  Right.  These 12-hour days are fucking murder.  He does.  I want to tell you this.  E-Rock got on a morning flight this morning, and you guys, you've got to give him credit.  He's already been awake for close to nine and a half hours.  That's approaching 12.  Oh. 
[00:13:30]  Oh.  E-Rock, you don't take pictures while you're on stage.  Why not?  Also, you'll notice that E-Rock has a little confidence.  He's got a strong buzz on.  He's drunk a little bit already.  Yeah.  He's already somewhat drunk.  E-Rock, you drinking a little bit?  Your face is very red.  Oh, a few Bloody Marys, a couple Roman Cokes.  Let me ask you this.  Chicago's feeling pretty fucking good right now.  This is after-show E-Rock.  This is confident E-Rock in front of all of you. 
[00:14:00]  Wait till the hosts get here.  Give it half an hour.  You won't hear me talk for the rest of the show.  Now, the question that I would really like to know is, we always see when people meet  E-Rock in person, there's such descriptions of E-Rock on the radio.  We paint such the picture of him.  Is he as fat as you all thought he would be?  No.  But is he fat?  Yes.  There he is.  I don't think that last part was necessary.  We'll still talk about it.  He's still fat.  Well, thank you, E-Rock.  I'm glad you made it. 
[00:14:30]  Is there anything you want to say in reference to Troy Kwan not making it?  He takes a lot of shots at you.  I don't know if you have an opinion one way or the other.  Well, it just goes to show that Troy really doesn't give a shit.  Oh, come on.  Not about the show?  Not about anything?  Not about the show.  Not about work dedication.  Not about anything being here.  Well, let's say this.  How excited are we?  Why don't we hit the audience?  E-Rock is drunk, everybody.  Let's give it up for E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:15:00]  Are you chanting fatty?  Fatty.  So what should we tell?  Should we tell E-Rock to come back here?  And what should we do after he comes back here?  I'm back here and shut up is indeed exactly what E-Rock should do.  All right.  How many people are here with an oddest thing you own?  Here.  You are.  You are, sir.  E-Rock, we just talked to you.  Oh, it's not you.  What's your name, sir?  Don't tell me what you have.  What's your name? 
[00:15:30]  My name is Corey.  Corey, you look like the type of guy who would have an oddest thing you own.  How long have you had this item?  How excited are you to show us?  I had it for about 10 years.  I got it from my brother for Christmas, so I'm ready to get rid of it.  Are you confident that you will win the $1,000 prize for the oddest thing you own?  Are you confident?  No!  No, he said no!  He said no!  Well, still, it's only important that you play.  And you, sir, you styled your facial hair after my father.  What's your name?  Come to the stage. 
[00:16:00]  Heath.  Heath?  Like Heath Ledger?  I wish you were like Heath Ledger.  Now, you have an oddest thing you own.  How long have you had it for?  About eight years.  Is it something that humiliates you for owning it?  What was the question?  Are you humiliated by the fact that you own it, or is it a prized possession of yours?  No, it's a prized possession.  It is a prized possession.  How confident are you that you will win the $1,000?  There's not many people here with oddest things I've been talking around, so...  Well, you got this guy right here who kind of looks like E-Rod. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, this guy right here.  That's it, huh?  That's it.  So what do you think?  We'll see.  What do you think?  You got to have more confidence than that to play this game.  I'm going to win.  You are going to win.  He's going to win.  Who else thinks they're going to win?  This guy right here.  You do.  That'll be easier for you.  You got something in a box.  Don't open that box.  I'm not going to open the box.  What's in the box?  We'll find out later.  You're excited to show this to everybody?  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  The box is the size of a finger.  Is it a finger?  No.  Thank God for that.  It's no body parts.  Based on these two guys who are not confident at all.  They probably have body parts, so... 
[00:17:00]  You think you're going to win?  He's got a bag.  He could have, like, a head in that bag.  He could have a head in that bag.  Who knows?  That one bothers me because it's insulated.  It is.  This guy over here, he's got a weird handlebar mustache.  That means...  I mean, what the fuck would have to be kept cold?  I don't know.  He brought his oddest thing you own in an insulated bag.  Keep in mind, the last time somebody participated in the oddest thing you own, it was in Philadelphia.  It was a dead monkey, and he performed oral sex on it.  So we'll see what Chicago has to offer.  We'll see what Chicago has to offer. 
[00:17:30]  Danny, this lady has something to tell me.  What's your name, miss?  My name is Jackie.  Jackie.  First of all, I would like to say this.  I can't believe the number of attractive women that showed up to this Chicago city.  You know who I'm talking to.  There have been some very attractive women in this city.  It's amazing.  Not only in this city, but it turned out for an Opie and Anthony gig.  I'm representing New York.  You are?  You came from New York?  Yeah.  Oh, that's unfortunate.  Don't drop your teeth. 
[00:18:00]  Where in New York are you from?  Centerport.  Centerport.  And you just drove here?  You flew here?  A plane, a train, and two buses.  Why wouldn't you just wait until we're at the Hard Rock again?  I'd go on to see Chicago anyway.  Chicago's great.  Isn't it great?  Yeah, it is.  You know, some of you guys don't like it as much.  I was up on the Willis Tower earlier today.  It's terrifying.  It's terrifying.  All right, Danny.  It's tough.  Oh, you've got an honest thing you own? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, yes.  You do?  Yes.  Okay.  Is it something that's attached to you, maybe in the chest area?  No.  Okay, just asking.  No, no, no, no, no.  Are you excited about showing this off?  Yes, I love it, but my husband hates it.  He hates it?  Yeah.  How happy are we that she has a husband?  All right, well, have you had it for a long time?  I've had it since 2001.  And you think that this is enough to get the $1,000?  I do.  That's fantastic.  She thinks she's going to win. 
[00:19:00]  All right, before we get to you, we'll get to you.  Mr. Drinks Early.  We'll get to you in a minute.  What about this guy?  We've got a man over here who's smartly dressed.  He's in a polo shirt, but it says Opie and Anthony spread the virus.  Where did you get that shirt?  Got it online.  I didn't even know they exist.  They do a couple years ago.  Well, do you have something odd?  Is the shirt the oddest thing you own?  No.  What is it?  No, don't tell me what it is.  It's something very rare that I got at the Atlanta airport 12 years ago.  Don't say any more. 
[00:19:30]  Don't say any more.  But is it odder than what she has, do you think?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I don't think so.  She doesn't think so, though.  I don't think so.  Oh, I can't wait to see how this works out.  The tension is mounting, Danny Ross.  I can feel it.  The tension is mounting.  All right.  Let's talk to Mr. Needs' attention.  How are you doing today, sir?  Dude, I am doing fucking spectacular.  Joe Walsh is here.  Can I just say for the record, I mean, the guys out there, they can't see this person. 
[00:20:00]  So this guy, he's kind of sweaty and long hair, aviator glasses, with a Pabst Blue Ribbon  T-shirt, covered in tattoos.  And let me tell you, he sounds exactly like he looks.  Dude, my name's Warren Halffield.  I play in the band of Serbihandlers in West Virginia.  And I came from West Virginia.  No shit, huh?  West Virginia's in the house.  Let me see.  Dude, I totally believe you.  I don't have to see your license.  It says your driver's license.  And you're missing teeth, so there's the fucking clincher.  It says, hang on, hang on, hang on. 
[00:20:30]  I'm fucking toothless, right?  Yes, that is correct.  West Virginia is indeed on his driver's license.  There you go, sir.  Now, why do you keep taking out your tooth?  Um, well, I'll sit up, I'll sit up.  Okay, never mind.  It doesn't matter.  Hey, fuck you.  Hey.  I don't, I don't, I don't care.  I don't care.  What are you here to do here today?  I'm here.  Are you here to play one of the games?  I'm here to play two games.  No, you're going to play one.  Well, I'm.  The first one is how drunk can I possibly get before the show starts?  We'll play one game.  I'm not drunk yet.  I'm not drunk yet.  No, obviously not. 
[00:21:00]  I want to do the bad breath and the chip.  All right, you're going to do the bad breath one because it's just a waste of time to do  the chip one for you.  You can't form a sentence as a human being.  Were you trying to call me out or something?  Right, yeah.  Well, just do the bad breath one.  That should work.  How is his breath, by the way, sir?  What up?  How's his breath?  Stank.  All right, so he should.  Maybe he'll do well.  Maybe he'll do well.  Keep in mind, E-Rock is a bad breath expert.  So, uh, he is.  E-Rock, how did you get to be such a bad breath expert?  I think by default. 
[00:21:30]  No, it wasn't default.  It was years of experience.  Okay, if you want to go with that.  I think it is.  Um, and chips.  Who's trying?  Not this guy.  Anyone else trying to be the next Chip Chipperson?  All the way in the back, you're going to have to come to the front because we're not going to, you know.  We've got a guy over here, too.  Which guy?  We've got a big boy over here.  Okay.  Now, you think, don't do the chip impression because that's for the show.  But you think you have what it takes to be the next chip.  Don't do the chip impression.  My teeth are dry.  He's already got Edgar down, so I think he can do chip. 
[00:22:00]  It's not bad.  What about this guy over here in the white t-shirt?  Do you do other impressions besides Chip?  I don't do any impressions.  So why do you want to be Chip so bad?  Because I look like Jim Norton, kind of.  So it would be easier to look.  Yeah, but if Jim Norton wanted a new look for Chip and it was Jim Norton, he probably would eat you.  It's easier to pull off my look than should I go with, like, a latex cosmetic bullshit.  There's a difference between something looking effortless and you putting no effort into something.  Okay.  Listen.  Real quick. 
[00:22:30]  Before we move on, they can hear me if I go back there, right?  Okay.  I'm going to go back here for a second.  Are you guys ready?  What are the people supposed to look at on the stage?  Are you guys ready to do the show?  Are you guys...  Opie.  Opie's back here, everybody.  I'm talking to him.  Opie, are you ready to do the show?  I'm having a calm my nerves beer right now.  Oh!  E-Rock's had about 15 of them so far.  Opie's drunk.  Why are you yelling?  You're not in front of the crowd.  Because I got headphones on.  And Anthony, are you ready for this? 
[00:23:00]  This is a big gig.  Chicago's out there waiting for you and Opie.  You're tweeting.  You're not doing...  I don't see a lot of show prep.  I don't see a lot of printouts.  No bit preparing.  I wing it.  That's what professionals do, Sam.  I got notes.  Did you tell the crowd you were scared in the glass box or no?  I told them that the Willis Tower was terrifying, yes.  And it was.  It was.  Listen.  It can't be too much.  Yeah.  It was terrifying for you.  Everyone else had a blast.  It's very high up. 
[00:23:30]  Listen.  You can tell that story on your show, okay?  Which is only a couple minutes away.  So I hope you guys are ready.  I wanted to give you your warning.  Because in about a minute, I'm going to throw it to music.  And then you got to go on.  Whether you're ready or not.  I hate on-air Sam.  Sorry, Ant.  Sorry, Ant.  I love on-air Anthony.  I'm back on stage.  I'm coming back on stage now.  Okay.  Listen.  Prime time.  Prime time.  Okay.  There's one guy chanting prime time. 
[00:24:00]  I don't think it's going to catch up.  I just don't think it's catching up.  We have the worst breath in Chicago.  We have Chip off the old block.  We have Otis Thing You Own.  Coke Logic is here.  And I'll tell you this.  Years ago, the great Patrice O'Neill gave Coke Logic the advice that when he's picking up chicks in a bar,  just look at them and say,  I'm Coke Logic, bitch.  This is the one bar where it might work. 
[00:24:30]  It might work for Coke Logic if he tries it.  The Opie and Anthony Show is coming up right now.  Get amped.  Get excited.  But don't start cheering until you see them.  Goodbye, everybody.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  And now, for the first time ever,  the Opie and Anthony Show invades Chicago. 
[00:25:00]  Live from 115 Bourbon Street.  Here are your hosts,  Opie,  Anthony,  and Jim Norton.  We're 20 seconds away.  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A! 
[00:25:30]  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  Hello, Chicago.  O-N-A!  Everybody ready for a good time?  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  Well,  prepare to be starstruck.  O-N-A!  I bring you,  for the first time in Chicago,  O-N-A!  Our heroes, 
[00:26:00]  Opie,  Anthony,  and Jim Norton!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A! 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Oh, my God.  This is fucking cool.  Chicago.  Fucking Chicago.  This is amazing.  Oh, wherever the hell we are.  That's like being out on Long Island in New York and saying, New York City.  Just ain't quite it.  Hey, could everybody put their arms up so I can Twitter a picture and make it look like more than it is?  Oh, that's good, Jimmy. 
[00:27:00]  Hi.  Thank you.  All right.  Don't worry.  Just stand there and let me and Jimmy survey the pussy.  Yeah.  How uncomfortable would it be if we all just panicked and then had nothing to say for two hours?  Like every day on the show.  I was going to say, it would be the first time.  How does Sam do for everybody?  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:27:30]  Wow.  I got to tell you.  This is our first time in this area.  I'll just say in this area.  But we're staying in Chicago.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy farted again.  Jimmy, you nervous?  Yeah.  I know.  I purposely didn't shit before I left.  Wait, you know I could smell it over there?  I could smell it.  I thought I...  I knew you didn't shit because I thought I smelled cum. 
[00:28:00]  Who's this guy?  Yes.  This guy's going to be a problem.  I can't tell you.  We've done this way too many times.  We know this guy will be a problem.  No, Eric Bloom from Lois the Cult.  You came from...  Hold on, Sam.  Mike can be...  Oh, where'd you come from?  I came here from...  I came here from...  Wait.  Oh, man. 
[00:28:30]  They can't hear it, Sam.  Why wouldn't we be able to hear it?  Put it on so everyone can hear it.  Okay.  My name's Lauren Hatfield.  At Hatfield.  From West Virginia.  Oh, shit.  From West Virginia.  You're a Hatfield?  Yeah, Hatfield.  And I come to be not a Hat Valley.  The same.  Good one, Chip.  I just got a hot eye between you or something.  So, you drove up from Virginia. 
[00:29:00]  Why?  Oh, well...  He's a Hatfield!  Because I like your dumb ass.  All right.  You like Anthony.  No, but seriously, all bullshit aside,  I got a baby mom on South Chicago, so...  Somehow that didn't surprise us.  Yes.  That's great.  She's Hispanic, too, so, you know.  You all right with that, Ant?  Yeah, I have no problem with whatever this guy does.  Believe me. 
[00:29:30]  I'm in a band.  Of course you are.  So...  It's called...  Yeah, so is the guy that shot up that church.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Yeah?  Actually, I stole from a church music equipment,  but my band's called The Serpent Handlers...  Hold on a second.  You stole musical equipment from a church?  No.  No.  I didn't go to church. 
[00:30:00]  My band's called The Serpent Handlers of West Virginia.  That's what it's called.  The Serpent Handlers.  Oh, I know what that means.  Yeah.  The spitting serpents.  He wants more.  Oh, boy.  I think...  Are we no...  That's okay.  So far, you've contributed nothing, so it's all right.  I don't think you need any more mic time.  Wow.  Wow.  Come on, Sam.  You know, some technical difficulty.  I was up very, very late last night. 
[00:30:30]  You know, I like to gamble,  and I went to a casino.  You guys didn't go.  I guess you were hanging out,  but it was really...  I felt like I was with the entire cast  of every episode of First 48.  I have never been to a more ghetto casino in my life,  and I've been to some real shitholes.  Is that good or bad?  Well, it was interesting.  I almost felt good that I didn't win,  because I knew they'd have bashed me  over the fucking head and stole whatever I won. 
[00:31:00]  I felt like a winner for losing.  It's ironic that the man who fucking screams,  Black Jack,  wants a really fucking gentleman's establishment.  Keith had to bring him a pillow  to scream into and punch.  In the room.  Wait, wait.  When you get fucked up,  I couldn't think of that. 
[00:31:30]  How did you do, Ant, by the way?  Did you do good?  I dropped seven grand.  Ouch.  Wow.  Yeah, and really in no time either.  Oh, that never happens.  Yeah, I got my ass handed to me.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but I thought I might have lost more  just walking to my car.  It was, uh...  Wow.  Yeah.  But we'll be there Saturday also.  You know, Jimmy's, uh, doing the, um...  Antisocial show. 
[00:32:00]  Antisocial show.  Yeah, yay.  How many people are going to that?  Going to that one?  Nice.  Nice.  Tickets still available.  You bet they are.  Yeah, something told me  from walking around that casino,  not a big Jimmy Norton crowd.  Yeah.  Holy man.  Huh?  Oh, boy.  That guy again.  Oh, boy.  We should just give him his own mic, right?  Yeah, he's a psychopath.  Fucking really weird jail tattoos  and aviator sunglasses. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  He don't shut up.  And look, Sam gravitates to him  because this is the kind of guest  he'd have on his shit show.  What are we going to say?  I'm Jim Jones.  Hey, asshole, shut the fuck up.  Oh, shit.  Go ahead, Sam.  He's talking to you, Opie.  Wow.  Yes, sir? 
[00:33:00]  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Where are you from?  I'm from Janesville, Wisconsin.  All right.  Hey, we got all some trees here.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They don't like...  We got a lot of people  from a lot of different areas.  We noticed a lot of different  license plates out there.  How many did you print up?  Yeah, a lot of people  from a lot of different places.  Very cool.  Wait, the Wisconsin guy  is strung back in shame. 
[00:33:30]  Sam, where are you going?  We're talking to the Wisconsin guy.  Holy shit, she's cute.  We wanted more than where he's from.  Fucking asshole.  What were you saying, sir?  I had the Doubletree.  It's a hotel!  Why did you say Doubletree?  You're staying there?  Yeah.  What, are you putting out the feelers?  No, you don't.  I think the gentleman next to you  might be interested.  He's invited.  He goes, fuck.  Wait, what's happening  at the Doubletree?  I'm sorry?  What's happening at the Doubletree? 
[00:34:00]  Why are you saying Doubletree?  It's close.  I didn't want a long cab ride.  But why are you telling us  Yeah, why are you telling us  what you're saying?  I don't know.  You're asking questions.  I'm answering.  Wow.  He really is a  right-to-the-point kind of guy.  He really is, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wait.  Hey, whoa.  Where are they going?  Oh, he's all right.  You don't have to throw him out.  Yeah, don't throw him out.  He's all right.  Don't throw him out.  Just punch him in the face.  Let him hang out over there. 
[00:34:30]  Don't throw him out.  Don't throw him out.  Don't throw him out.  Just kind of put him back in the crowd  so he's got to work his way up  like a fucking salmon.  Yeah.  He's having fun.  Don't toss him.  He's all right.  Yeah, yeah.  They're allowing you to drink, right?  That's good.  I like this afternoon shit.  It reminds me of the good old days  when we used to do afternoon drive  and I was completely drunk all the time  as opposed to half drunk in the morning.  We did nothing.  It's more fun being Anthony  than it is me or Opie. 
[00:35:00]  Me and him just go to dinner  like a couple of fruits  and ants have fucking gambling  and cursing like De Niro in Mean Streets.  But then I have to pop et cetera  like Pez.  I get a headache and a hangover.  What are you going to do?  It happens.  And poor Keith has to deal with my  hijinks and shenanigans all night long.  I'm just ready to feed back.  We went to the Willis Tower last night.  I went with Keith.  What are you talking about?  They like the Sears Tower  for these people.  Somebody Twittered 
[00:35:30]  the very funny thing  that I should try going  to the Dudley Tower.  It's right near the bike shop.  Somebody Twittered  a very funny line.  It's a molestation joke.  Yeah, you know.  Hilarious.  Yeah, with his fucking father  with giant teeth.  I'm like, Dudley,  I was worried about you.  Were you?  Fucking A.  Celebrities all around.  John Wayne Gacy.  How you doing, man?  John Wayne Gacy.  That's quite a look out there, sir.  You probably should have  eyes and moustache, too.  That's good.  Plenty of young boys  to choose from here. 
[00:36:00]  He looks like Jason.  And he's in the right city.  Sam, give him a mic.  What is he all about?  Yeah, what the hell  are you all about?  What, did you get  the E-Rock school of hair dyeing?  Yeah.  Or did you steal that  from Pesci and JFK?  I got cancer of the neck.  I've had it for years.  Sam will appreciate it.  A little Dolph Ziggler.  Oh, there you go.  Sam, you appreciate that?  He's a wrestler.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, yeah, there you go.  Everyone boos whoever talks.  It's hilarious.  Boo, fuck you. 
[00:36:30]  What's like spouting  the cure for AIDS?  You're just like,  fuck, shut up.  Why didn't you dye the moustache?  I find it funnier this way.  You're right.  You are absolutely right.  You win.  Unfortunately,  you don't have a hair lip.  That would have been even better.  Nothing better than a moustache  with a hair lip.  Looks like you're drawing a line  and the pencil broke.  We're not topping that.  Take us out.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Chip is an asshole.  We hate Chip. 
[00:37:00]  We hate Chip.  I think you guys  might have just missed this guy  who spit his beer out  into his beer  and now he's drinking it back again.  Jimmy, come on.  Wait, what's going on?  What happened to you?  I was laughing  and I spit it back into my cup.  All right, that's fine.  Yeah, that happened.  Shut up.  Just thought I'd help the crowd out.  Yeah, why don't you spit your beer  and then shut up?  Oh, E-Rock.  Fucking E-Rock.  Did the crowd meet E-Rock today?  Oh, yeah, they did. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah?  Did they enjoy him?  They were chanting E-Rock.  E-Rock?  Really?  They were chanting E-Rock.  Wow.  Nice.  We'd bring him up  but we're not sure  how strong the stage is.  Very good.  But I guess he made it  from New York.  We were worried  about his travel plans.  About everybody,  as a matter of fact.  Especially the management  because we really wanted  them to attend.  Yeah.  We should have the management  come on stage  and take a bow.  Not unless we get  chicken wire up here. 
[00:38:00]  It's funny.  You asked for them  not to be visible.  answer that he didn't  want them visible  and they are actually  in the back.  Well, they're listening.  Just huddled in shame.  Oh, I'm sure they're  shaking their head  in some fucking disapproval.  What's that?  I'll be struck.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Soon.  Yeah.  Cheers!  Before the, uh,  you know,  before this whole thing  wraps up in hours  from now,  I would like to maybe  do a shot of Jaeger  with a few of you  motherfuckers. 
[00:38:30]  I don't think  that would be fun.  I don't think  that's going to be  a problem.  There's no afternoon  shows complete  until I flop down  drunk face first.  Actually, no evening  is complete.  No afternoon,  no morning.  All right.  We get it.  I like to drink.  Can we talk to  a few of the ladies?  Ah!  We've talked to  enough dudes.  Exactly.  Yeah, a few of the ladies.  She's with a guy.  I don't want to talk to her.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm teasing.  They're raising hands  out there.  Danny is running  through the crowd 
[00:39:00]  to find something  with a vagina.  Whoa!  Good luck.  Hello, madam.  You want to talk?  Right here?  Hi.  Hey, how are you?  Hi.  Where are you from?  I'm from Boston.  Boston?  I love Boston girls.  They're very territorial here.  They really are, man.  Wow.  That's good.  You want to go into  your Yankees suck chant now?  We get it.  In church,  they're chanting that shit.  Oh, okay.  Well, they do the same thing here,  but not with the gusto 
[00:39:30]  they do in Boston.  How'd you get here?  Would you drive?  Well, I go to college  in Chicago.  I go to Northwestern.  Yeah, all of a sudden  Tree Fort Richard  was next to me.  What are you taking in college?  Dick.  I'm kidding.  Of course,  you look like  a wonderful young lady.  Is that your gent next to you?  Um, back here.  My brother. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, right next girl.  No.  Oh, sorry.  What, you said your brother?  Totally single.  Whoa!  Whoa!  No, me and my brother  are huge fans.  My brother and I!  What a shit school  that must be.  Jesus.  So, your brother  and yourself.  And myself.  He flew in  just so we could go see you guys.  And his bombs 
[00:40:30]  are killing him.  I don't know.  That's not what she means, Anthony.  She's implying  that they took aircraft.  Thanks, Chip.  Hate literal, Chip.  So, you flew in  and just for this?  Yeah?  He did.  Sorry.  No, he did.  She goes to school here.  Yeah, I go to school here.  Oh, see, I was all fucked up.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm originally from Boston.  It doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't.  You're so correct.  I like you, though.  Oh, thank you.  I like you as well.  All right.  Oh, wow.  You guys want to talk  to another lady out there? 
[00:41:00]  Hold on a second.  We're still talking  to this one now.  Anthony's making headway.  And I want to get to know her  just in case he's too drunk  to get an erection.  I can step in.  I wouldn't try to fuck her.  I would just jerk him off  and watch.  All right.  Here, everyone,  stand by two seconds.  Eith K.  Et K.  Eide Umberne.  That's Igpe Atnle.  And speaking of that,  why don't you find  somebody else?  All right.  Oh, there's the Jager mic.  Oh, come on.  You asked for the Jager mic.  You did ask for Jager. 
[00:41:30]  Holy fucking Chicago-sized shots.  Wow.  Deep dish.  Yeah, huh?  Hey, we're doing some shots  of Jager, huh?  This will go great  with some deep dish pizza.  Hey, right.  That's a fucking...  This is a...  That's a tumbler.  Being a child of the 80s,  I think you could realize  this is like those  Dixie Riddle cups.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  You don't even have  the chance.  Of course I'll do it.  That's like breathe.  Breathe. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Well, we have to have  somebody smell it.  He's tasting it.  He's the official taster  of the opiate nation.  All right.  Yes.  Keep the cup, everyone.  Yes, keep the cup.  Do you spit news?  He actually does that  before Anthony has sex, too.  He just licks the vagina.  All right.  Cheers.  Nice.  Damn.  Wow.  Bravo.  All right, guys.  Hey, sir. 
[00:42:30]  Go fuck your mother.  I'm really...  I go like that.  You want to talk to  another lady or what?  Oh, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Who else we got in the crowd  that wants to talk to you?  This lady really wants  to talk to you guys.  Yay.  Of course she does.  What's up, guys?  All right.  How are we doing?  Why don't we take...  You need to eat,  can you get some umbernates?  That's great.  What?  What's up?  What's your name, madam?  Carolyn.  Thank you for coming, Carolyn.  That's fucking...  Thank you for showing up.  Where are you from?  Where are you from, Carolyn? 
[00:43:00]  Right down the street.  Chicago, maybe.  Right down the street?  Oh, welcome.  That's cool.  Where?  Like how far?  What's the matter?  Like five minutes.  Oh, come on.  We live in Oakland, so...  Who are you here with?  My husband.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That's it.  We're your biggest fans.  Oh, thank you.  Obviously.  Yeah, your man's one of those guys  that likes a little junk  in that trunk, don't he?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  She's showing it.  I'm the big ass. 
[00:43:30]  He loves a big ass.  Well, this is Jim Norton.  Ass, ass, titties, titties,  ass, and titties.  Oh, shit.  Don't forget the belly.  Oh, Jesus.  Opie.  Excuse me.  The guy can't just be fucking nice  for two seconds.  Get it straight, Opie.  That's a beer belly, my friend.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Fair enough.  That's good.  That just reminds me.  I'm just a complete non sequitur.  I didn't know Chris Farley  was from Chicago, right?  Yes, he is.  No, it was just a non sequitur.  I just was saying that he's...  I'm teasing. 
[00:44:00]  Come on now.  You're saying you look like Chris Farley.  I don't want Gus Hanson  to get mad at me over there.  Excellent.  I'm going home now.  Ant, you used to be my favorite.  Thanks.  No, I ruled.  No, don't go anywhere.  Well, she goes home.  Five more people could get in.  What happened?  What?  Holy shit.  I love drunk Opie. 
[00:44:30]  Opie's drunk.  Opie's drunk.  Opie's drunk.  Opie's drunk.  Holy shit.  Wow, that's brutal.  Wow, that's cool.  All right, Danny Ross, where are you?  Anybody else in the crowd?  We want to see hi to.  Is there anybody that wants to talk to the guys?  Oh, are these guys porny?  No, no, no.  No more guys.  Also, Danny, hit yourself in the side of the head  to change your aspect ratio.  I think it's on stretch before you pick another girl.  Oh, man, who's that? 
[00:45:00]  Oh, there we go.  Oh, we know.  This is one of our old favorite people.  Hi.  Oh, wait a minute.  Who's that?  I'm Brittany.  Brittany?  Oh, hi, man.  Brittany was a cherry dart participant in Cleveland.  Holy shit.  Hey, Brittany.  How you doing, Brittany?  Wow.  I can't even see that far.  She's following us.  Hi, Brittany.  That's pretty cool.  Is Cleveland far from here?  I don't even know.  Cleveland's far from everywhere.  Yeah.  Fucking Twilight Zone City.  That fucking place is.  Four hours. 
[00:45:30]  Four hours.  Yeah, but it's worth it just to get out of Cleveland.  Wow, look at the tits.  Oh, shit.  My mind just flew right out of my mouth before I thought.  Here was my cherry dart partner.  Oh, boy.  Another one with a...  Wow.  Yeah, another...  Amazing.  Damn.  That was exciting.  Thank you, dudes.  Enough of the dudes.  I'm teasing, of course.  This can't be my personal pussy party.  I understand.  We have to cater to some of the men here.  Are they ready?  Are they ready? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, look at him.  He's got a Laszlo Show shirt on.  I love Laszlo.  Where are you from, sir?  Yes, sir.  From San Diego, California.  San Diego?  Yeah.  What are you doing here?  Oh, man.  Another fool.  They hate every city.  Excuse me, guys?  Yes, Danny Ross.  Yes, Danny.  Oh, damn.  Fuck the guy from San Diego.  No, don't.  Wait a minute.  What's your name?  Kelly. 
[00:46:30]  Hi, Kelly.  Are you with the girl behind you?  I am.  This is my cousin, Carla.  Ah.  Your cousin, Carla.  Now, Kelly, do you spell that with a Y or an I with a heart over it?  An I with a little tiny heart over it.  Yay.  Wow.  And are you here with a guy friend, too?  I am not.  It's just my friend.  All right.  Ethk.  Ethk.  Ethk.  Do you have a big click?  Because Jimmy likes.  That's a fair question.  I was trying to help out my friend, Jimmy.  It's just hanging.  On the bus on the way here, Jimmy was talking about what he likes. 
[00:47:00]  And he said, I like a fat pussy.  And he did this thing that you only do it like cocks.  Like, you don't measure a pussy like this.  You go like a fat pussy, maybe, and go sideways with your fingers open.  But he was like top and bottom.  And then it started turning into this thing going, I love a fat pussy.  And he's like, he's manipulating balls and jerking a dick off in his mouth.  And it's like, it doesn't matter how many times you say pussy, it's a cock.  Jimmy, comment? 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah?  No, I was talking about things.  And I said she has a fat pussy.  I really do.  First of all, nobody's.  This is not an impressive cock on anybody.  That's an impressive fat pussy.  I like a pussy that's a pile.  It should look like somebody took, like, Lady Gaga's meat dress.  It should look like her meat dress piled up on the bank.  He's going to spit his beer out again.  That guy just has problems.  Jimmy likes a pussy that looks like a steak of a sandwich. 
[00:48:00]  Kelly, where are you from?  Des Moines, Iowa.  Oh, nice.  Just a country girl.  Yes.  Yeah?  No?  No.  No?  So, do you like it when a guy is talking to you and he does a lot of Radar O'Reilly references?  Oh, I love it.  Who doesn't?  Do you like being diddled with a deformed hand?  Of course he was, Jimmy.  Of course he was.  But maybe that would have worked if the show didn't go off the air in 1982.  Those people weren't born yet. 
[00:48:30]  I know.  Jesus.  So, Kelly, are you single?  I'm not hitting on you.  I'm asking for a reason.  I am not single.  Oh, where's your husband or boyfriend?  Boyfriend's back home.  Okay.  That's all the counts.  He doesn't like the show, so I came without him.  It's not him.  Yeah, I know.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Yeah.  Most guys with small dicks don't like this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what he's going to like even less than a show?  If you come back with herpes from me.  Oh, would he not like that?  Who gave you this guy from that show?  Oh, I could trump that with AIDS. 
[00:49:00]  Nice.  You're very pretty.  How old are you?  I'm old.  I'm 30.  Oh, boy.  Get out of here.  Just turned 30.  You're way too old.  You don't have no kids, do you?  Nope.  All right.  I'm on the ball now.  What are you supposed to bounce in your lap?  I'll go to your house and have nothing to do.  Well, you know, you look very good. 
[00:49:30]  Well, thank you very much.  I'm not saying 30 is old, but for me, you know, you've got to chop that in half.  Just about, yeah.  And then take three years off.  Give or take.  Depending on what state.  Right.  Always good.  You do know the laws, right?  Well, state or Thailand.  Yeah.  Anyone else, Danny?  Oh, man.  Unless you're some lovely.  There's lovely ladies everywhere.  There really are, man.  There's a lot more women here than normally should.  I know.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  What did you think?  There's a lovely lady right here. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  Oh, well.  What have we got here?  Oh.  Hi.  Oh, I like your Chris Jericho hairdo.  My penis does the same thing if you touch it.  Not when I touch it.  Oh, yes.  I swear.  That must be your gentleman friend.  God damn it.  He's a big fucker, too.  God damn it.  I wouldn't mind if you were dating the guy in the wheelchair, because we could just run  away from him.  Yeah, that guy would be a problem. 
[00:50:30]  Why don't we give her the Mongo?  Go.  You are a big motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's accurate.  That's accurate.  Wow.  You found yourself a winner there.  Yeah.  Double guns, Kumia.  Oh, yeah.  That's like...  Hey, that's good.  Just steal my shit.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, no guns here.  Fuck.  What do you do, sir, for a living?  I own a couple of restaurants.  Oh, obviously, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  What, do you taste the inventory?  I'm fat.  Westminster Hot Dog is the name of the restaurant.  Let me get it over at SiriusXM Sailor Radio.  So come eat at my restaurant and make me rich.  Please.  That's pretty good.  All right.  We can do that.  And what, was she a big hot dog fan?  It's actually a sausage restaurant.  Oh.  Wow.  Sausage.  Yes.  Oh, so you landed Abe Froman.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  So what did you guys do on your first date?  Just sit in the car and roll up the windows and blow hot dog burps at each other?  What a romantic evening.  That's his fetish.  He likes her to blow hot dog burps in his face until he's leaking clear stuff.  Wow.  Are you married or just going out?  Did I miss that?  We're getting married in 30 days.  Wow.  You better get a prenup after that sausage money.  Yeah.  After that lucrative sausage money. 
[00:52:00]  I think the future earnings in sausage you should share in the Dominic Barber thigh.  So how long have you been dating?  About four years.  Four years.  And where are you going on your honeymoon?  I think Mexico.  That's a good place.  There's no beheadings going on there.  Real smart.  Where are you going?  Oh, we're going to put on yarmulkes and go to Yemen.  All right.  That's a lovely vacation spot.  Yeah.  There's plenty of great cartels we want to visit.  I just got a note from Roland, speaking of food. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, shit.  What did it say?  Let me read it.  It just says...  It just says pizza and cheesecake is here.  What are we going to do with that?  That figures.  Did you guys see Roland?  Roland!  Roland!  Roland, grab a mic and tell me what's going on with the pizza and the cheesecake.  Did that shirt come cheaper because the H is supposed to be a Z?  Oh!  See what I did there?  Working class zero, zero. 
[00:53:00]  What's a hero?  I know.  Oh, man.  Okay, so that guy looks just like the guy from American History X that killed the kid in  the bathroom.  But so does he and he and...  Well, I guess that's it.  We have such a diverse audience.  How many black guys?  I love diversity.  Hair and shaved heads.  We got a black guy over here, too. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  Yeah.  I saw you at the casino last night.  Or not.  I don't know.  So, Roland, we got pizza and cheesecake?  For what?  Us?  Yeah.  We got pizza and Illuminati's and Ellie's cheesecake.  Illuminati's?  Oh, that's good.  Hey, my Italian place.  It's Illuminati's.  Bill Bear don't like it.  Illuma...  Oh, fuck.  Illuminati's.  Yeah.  Illuminati's.  Hey, that's where you get the fucking deep dish pizza.  Yeah, mother... 
[00:54:00]  You're cack sucker.  Can we...  Illuminati's.  Illuminati's.  He's saying Illuminati's.  Yeah.  You are a retard.  Pizza box has a fucking triangle with an I in the middle of it.  It's delicious.  The masons made this pizza.  Hey, can we talk to some people on this side?  Because I feel bad that they had a big sign in there and they could not actually see my profile.  Uh, Jimmy, fuck the left.  I'd love to.  Oh.  See, my political ideology came into play.  See what I did there? 
[00:54:30]  It's called smart humor.  Yuck.  Okay, who do we have here?  Hi, I'm Jennifer.  Hi, Jennifer.  Yeah, that name!  Fuck you!  Oh, God.  Just take my money, bitch.  Anthony, you can call me whatever you want.  Oh.  Just don't call me late for sucking my cock.  Right on.  Oh, whoa!  As long as you return the favor.  Oh, let's tuck your cock.  I'll handle this, Ann. 
[00:55:00]  What is this, improv?  Let me get it.  That wasn't very nice.  No, it's not.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  We tease here.  Hello, madam.  How are you?  Until I come, then it's real.  I love Jimmy Norton.  Oh, thank you very much.  Oh.  Where are you from, Jennifer?  I'm from Hobart, originally from Chicago.  Oh.  We're in Indiana.  Indiana.  Yeah, it sounds it.  Originally from Chicago.  Oh, I love your cock.  That's a good one.  Fuck you, Anthony. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  What do you do for work?  I am a stay-at-home wife.  Stay-at-home wife.  Oh, shit.  A wife.  I like that.  She's another one.  She sounds hammered.  Actually, not really married.  We've been together for 20 years.  Not married.  Wow.  Good for him.  That's common law.  That's a guy who knows how to fucking put things off.  Right.  You definitely have clock tower sniper glasses on.  Yeah.  Wow.  When are we going to get married?  I'm just waiting for the Cubbies to win the series.  Never.  Oh, shit. 
[00:56:00]  I know.  That's why I said.  Wait, what?  Hey, it's topical.  Why don't we ask the guy, though?  Why 20 years, no marriage?  Why would you ruin the good thing?  Yeah, maybe you're right.  Well, words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom.  Having little problems with the old sperm.  I was waiting for you, Jimmy.  You're waiting for me?  Is there just a slower pace here?  Is that what I'm getting?  You guys are talking like, well, I think we're going to get married. 
[00:56:30]  You burned one on the way here, man.  You burned one.  A black guy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's the Midwest.  I thought it was racist.  Wow.  That was awkward.  It was awkward.  Wow.  You okay with that, Sox guy?  They're a little too close.  A little close.  Yeah.  You're in the front row, man.  I'm still trying to decompress from the casino last night.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I'm sorry I did that.  I apologize.  Okay, so you're with somebody. 
[00:57:00]  Are there any?  I'm asking for a reason.  Are there any single women here?  Are there any single ladies?  Are there any single ladies?  No, no, no.  I have a contest.  Honestly, it's called, Who Wants to Earn Some Money Later?  This guy is raising his hand.  This guy is raising his hand.  And Jimmy's not completely disinterested.  We're Jim Norton's money.  So we have people here.  What's that?  Rent money.  Rent money?  Rent money.  We're looking for girls.  Oh, we have to tell them.  So we're, thank you for the three of the same side. 
[00:57:30]  We're broadcasting live.  If you're listening and you're still working and you want to come down, we're live.  We're at 115 Bourbon Street in Marionette Park.  We have a really good crowd here.  Much better than I thought.  Yeah, absolutely.  But that isn't the note Iraq gave me.  It said, can you wrap it up?  I'm starving.  Iraq, come on.  We're doing a show here.  And we have, what do we have to do today?  Well, we have some stuff going on.  Well, Iraq is going to be judging the bad breath contest.  Do we have contestants for that? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Depending on, uh.  Do we actually have contestants that have really bad breath and they're hanging out in the crowd?  The guy who is in front here.  That guy had two.  Oh, that guy.  Oh, he had the tooth thing going.  West Virginia guy.  Wait, I didn't see his tooth.  He had a bad tooth?  Is he still here?  I hope he's still here.  He had a false front tooth.  Oh, he had a dead tooth.  I hope the possum I ate don't freshen my breath.  Ah, fuck.  All right, good, good, good.  There he is.  Oh, there he is.  All right.  We fucking saved your ass, brah.  We saved you.  Saved your ass, brah. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, Jimmy, you want to do like a little pre-dead breath contest?  I want Iraq to smell his dead tooth.  All right.  What happened?  What happened, Iraq?  What's wrong with Iraq?  If he's competing, then why?  We got to get somebody who's not going to participate.  Oh.  No, it's just to get...  You want to cleanse the palate with one of Jimmy's farts?  Who gives a fuck?  It's like sorbet.  We're just farting.  Hold on.  Iraq, on stage.  On stage.  We're going to have the official contest, but why not kick it off and see how bad this  guy's breath is? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, boy.  That's a little difficult.  Oh, shit.  Oh, the crowd is going wild.  No, his name is Lou.  They're just counting Lou.  Lou.  No, they're not.  Hi, buddy.  How are you?  Hold on.  No, no, no, no.  We're talking to turn around.  Okay, so, okay.  My name's Lauren Hedfield.  And listen, I swear.  Shut up.  I'm pumped.  He's working on the mic like wrestling.  This is like wrestling.  Shut up.  I'm glad.  I'm glad.  Listen.  Let me tell you something, Bruton.  It's the barber.  I'm here to win the Bad Bread Challenge. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  I'm here to win the Bad Bread Challenge.  I got a present for Jim Norton.  Yes, sir.  Oh, shit.  He just pulled his teeth out.  Or his tooth out.  That looks like the shrimp I had last night.  Let E-Rock smell that.  No, let E-Rock smell that.  Let E-Rock smell your denture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  E-Rock, take a good whiff.  I told you I'm fucking. 
[01:00:00]  I told you.  That's all.  I appreciate you guys coming.  Hold on, hold on.  This guy.  I hate to say it, but shut up.  We didn't get it on tape.  I got to get it on tape.  Oh.  E-Rock, you got to do it again.  I didn't get it on tape.  All right.  Smell that again.  E-Rock.  Is it bad?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, you know what's been between that fucking thing and his gums?  Yes.  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:30]  How is it?  Smells like caulk and cigarettes.  Let me say something.  Let me say something.  I didn't brush my teeth all week for this motherfucker.  All right.  Wow.  So you brush more than usual, you say.  Can you tell him to lay off?  I ain't going to hurt nobody.  Nah, Kenny does that.  It's okay.  He loves you.  Yeah, Kenny.  Well, tell him to pull out my wedge because it's funny.  You're giving him a wedgie, Kenny.  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  Well, thank you.  And you'll be involved later.  Let's talk for Dead Tooth Guy.  Dead Tooth Guy, everyone.  West Virginia. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Oh, give him his beer.  I love you, guys.  Oh, we love you, too, don't we?  Don't we?  Not literally.  Figuratively.  Hey, can we take a break?  Because I got to piss badly.  What?  I got to take a leak.  Oh, you got a little hummingbird bladder, don't you?  Yes, I do.  All right.  We can take a break.  Yeah, we've been on for 35, 36 minutes.  And the broadcast is only, what, 52 minutes long?  Oh, stop now.  According to management.  Yeah.  Now, we're going to do the contest.  What else do we got going on?  We have some other stuff going on.  Oh, I see a couple of lines from the compound T-shirts.  Thank you, guys, for the support. 
[01:01:30]  Wearing a half a swastika.  Oh, that's great.  Do we have people that are going to do chip off the old block today?  What's that?  Yeah.  Do we actually got contestants that are going to try to do the chip?  Yeah.  They didn't really get the part about doing the chip look.  I figured.  Okay, well, that's fine.  But they'll come up and do the chip.  Yeah, we're going to do it.  All right.  Maybe we'll do that after the break.  Then, oh, Honest Thing You Own.  Did people bring that shit?  Yes.  We got good stuff?  Yes.  And we do have a...  Hold on.  Are we going to beat a freeze-dried monkey from Philly?  Well, based on the fact that he gave the monkey oral sex afterwards, I don't know for 
[01:02:00]  sure.  But we have good stuff.  Sam is basically saying Chicago sucks.  That's what I heard.  Oh, Sam.  That's what I heard.  You know, Sam.  We're from here.  That's what I heard.  You're from here.  Do we know what they brought yet or no?  I know some of the stuff they've brought, not everything.  Did they say it on the air?  No, absolutely not.  Now, do they want to pawn it or sell it?  So, is there a possibility that we could beat the freeze-dried monkey Hummer thing?  We have some very odd things here.  Oh, cool. 
[01:02:30]  I just got a text from CM Punk who said, I'm headed your way for a shenanigan.  Oh, fuck.  CM Punk.  Well, here in the area, come on by.  Where are we?  115 Bourbon Street.  115 Bourbon Street.  Marionette Park.  Yes.  We also have, oh, we have that, which is a surprise.  Oh, we got a couple of, let's just say a couple of musical surprises that you might enjoy.  All right.  Hey, man, we're live in Chicago.  We'll be back in a few minutes.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, guys. 
[01:03:00]  Chicago.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is live from Chicago.  Chicago.  More O&A in moments.  And now, The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Live from Chicago.  Are we back?  I think we're back live in Chicago.  115 Bourbon Street.  Marionette Park.  In Chicago.  Yeah.  Wow.  We just lost our fucking hearing with that. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, that was very loud.  I don't know if anyone else understands that, so we'll just move on.  Anyway.  Now, what we're going to do, I guess, Opius Ridge, right?  You want to do the chip?  Yeah, we should see if anyone else could do the chip impression.  Chip off the old block.  Chip off the old block.  Exactly.  Sam, do we have contestants for this?  Jimmy's ass has died.  It just completely perished, and it's rotting away.  It's been exhumed.  Big crowds excited.  That's my excitement coming out.  Do you want the chips on stage? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, we have that chip.  We're talking about Jimmy's farts for a second.  That didn't make the air.  It's terrible.  It's like a silent movie up here.  We're all fanning your farts, and everyone's cracking up.  You all right?  Yeah, I feel good.  You feel good?  Never better, actually.  You feel good about the broadcast?  I love the broadcast so far.  All right, good.  We got a good crowd.  Good.  My farts are putrid, and I'm hoping to get...  It won't fucking go away!  Stop it!  Fuck, man!  They are so bad.  Thank you.  Did we bring the fart mask, Danny?  No, we didn't bring the fart mask. 
[01:04:30]  You smell it?  No!  Fuck!  It's going into the fucking crowd!  All right, well, you're welcome.  This is crazy!  You want it?  It's a 3D radio broadcast.  We got to bring the fart mask next broadcast.  Note to self.  All right, Sam, we got contestants for Chip Off The Old Block.  Yeah, now, do we have anything to give the winner?  Because it's just basically a judgment call by us three.  Someone who could do a good chip impression.  What do we have for them?  I think we're going to kick them in the groin and... 
[01:05:00]  No problem.  Is it an exhibition?  Yeah, this is for honor.  What do you mean for honor?  That stinks.  No one can hear you.  All right.  That's good.  Sam, call me.  I know.  We can hear you, Sam.  Okay.  We can hear you, Sam.  It's for honor.  Honor stinks.  Don't we have something to give?  These guys want cash.  What do we have for the chip?  How much?  For the best chip?  Whoa!  Well, according to Travis, we have $500 for the best chip.  $500.  Wow.  That's a lot of cake right there.  Honor can suck my dick.  $500 cash. 
[01:05:30]  Gets fucking the chip impressions going.  I loved you when Edward Norton beat you up in Fight Club.  All right.  What's your name, sir?  Honor.  My name is Kenny.  Where are you from, Kenny?  I'm from Champaign, Illinois.  Champaign?  Oh, you must be thirsty.  I'm really thirsty, Chippa.  Oh, shit.  Okay, now you...  Come back.  You have to do this to the crowd so they can see it, but I want to see the face, too.  I'm going to look at the face.  Oh, shit. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Here's his chip impression.  Right?  Something not funny.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead, sir.  Good face.  Bourbon Street?  What about Bourbon Street or something?  Holy shit.  And the crowd, their approval.  What the fuck was that shit?  Shut up, Chippa.  No, it was...  It wasn't bad, but it was a little...  It sounded like Stalker Chip. 
[01:06:30]  Like, Chip has it...  Do it again.  One more time.  Hold on.  Yeah, sir, you got to shut up, sir.  Hold on.  Well, listen, the guy with the aviator glasses and dumpster breath.  Hold on.  We're doing something.  How does one guy make it about himself?  It is amazing.  There's 500 people here.  We know one person.  Jesus.  All right.  Do your impression again.  Okay.  I want to hear it through this like the crowd.  One more time. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, fucking Bourbon Street.  What about Bourbon Street?  Wait.  You prepared one line?  Yes, sir.  It's Forrest Chip.  She had got the cancer or something.  It was AIDS.  Oh, yeah.  I buried her under a tree.  Fuck her.  That was Jenny.  So, all right.  Well, I guess we should do a couple more.  Maybe we can let the crowd vote.  I'm happy to let the crowd vote.  I think it's safe to say this guy is...  Well, he's safe to say he's a contestant. 
[01:07:30]  Okay.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I mean, let's be fair here.  You never know.  Who's our next contestant?  All right.  Yeah.  Let's give that a try once.  It's a $500 prize for the best chip impression.  A lot of cash.  Yeah.  A lot of cash.  Come on up.  Yes.  You got to come up.  He's Dr. Octopus.  Come up.  What the fuck?  Yes.  Oh, man.  All right.  That's a cool shirt.  It almost looks like Keith the Cop.  Steve C.  A little bit.  A little tribute to Steve C.  Tribute to Steve C.  Yes.  My sleeves are on fire. 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  Oh, banana.  Steve C's looking down on us all right now and hating us.  What's your name, first of all?  Steve.  I'm from...  Oh, wow.  Steve from Chicago.  All right.  Hey there, Steve.  All right.  I'm standing under this ring.  When am I at a Johnny Cash concert or something?  Is it a ring of fire?  That wasn't...  That was actually a better Travolta. 
[01:08:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  It's John Travolta, Chip.  I'm thinking Mr. Carter or something.  I don't know.  Why don't you suck my dick or something, then, if I'm John Travolta?  Hey, look.  I'm bored with it, all right?  All right?  Hey, grease.  It actually sounded like, hey, I'm Chip.  I'm warning you.  My eyes are going crazy.  All right.  We're going crazy over here.  All right.  So we have the first two, Chip.  Wow.  This is going swimmingly.  I'm sure people...  If you're Rodney King.  That's not funny. 
[01:09:00]  He passed away.  Oh, Chip.  Who do we got next, Sam?  This guy.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Jesus.  You're a bruiser.  He rock.  What's up?  Big boy.  He rock.  He rock.  He rock.  He rock.  He rock.  He rock.  He rock.  I can love the chair.  I believe maybe you need good new American hairdo.  What?  Very spanky on the top.  Look like a hedgehog.  I got something on this guy, believe it or not.  What?  He's the guy I talked about on Twitter a couple days ago. 
[01:09:30]  He put off his brain surgery to see us.  What an asshole.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Oh, what an idiot.  Believe me, you're not alone in this room.  Wait, why the brain surgery, though?  Yeah, why the brain surgery?  What's going on with you?  Talk to the mic.  No, talk to the...  I know you don't think well right now, but talk to the mic, please.  I got a tumor behind my left eye.  It's not the tumor.  Yeah.  I guess it is.  I'm going to hurt you, Red.  Wow.  Sorry, that's a great Santini tumor.  Okay.  So what are they going to do?  Like, where are they cutting you and all that? 
[01:10:00]  Maybe take it out, Opie?  No, I understand that, but how?  They can go...  They're going up...  They go...  Hey, you're talking to the mic.  They're going up under my lip and up through there.  Oh, my.  Like cocks in Jimmy's mouth.  Right.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wait a minute.  That's not polite, Anthony.  Wow, we got mean Anthony tonight.  I love it.  It's awkward.  No, I'm not.  Really?  What's that for?  I'm an angry drunk, which means I'm angry all the time.  Oh, you spilled something?  I didn't.  Opie hit the table twice and my...  Come on, let's fucking do this or something.  Oh.  Harvey Fire Chip, fucking cocksuckers. 
[01:10:30]  Look at this fucking guy.  Or that one.  You blew up brain surgery for this, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  How come you don't have a Threema?  Yeah.  I know, right?  Fuck.  Oh, the master.  Wow.  No, go ahead.  You go ahead.  I got up this morning and my mother was like, Chip, Chipa, you better dress up good because  it's going to be on the radio.  And I was like, radio? 
[01:11:00]  Is that like Ronnie James Dio's brother or something?  Oh, man.  That's good.  It's almost Beavis and Butthead.  That was pretty good, though, because the radio and the Ronnie Dio, I got it.  It was okay.  Well, I hope you take care of that George Harriton.  Can I, hold on.  Can I point out the genius of Anthony?  Oh, please.  He took brain cancer and obesity and put them together in a topical reference.  He thought of a guy who had brain cancer and died of it and he could make a fat joke. 
[01:11:30]  That was very fucking amazing.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jim Norton.  Why the 11.59 tattoo, by the way?  Uh-oh.  That's how many minutes he has to live.  That's right, man.  All right.  That's terrible.  I'm kidding.  What are you going to say next?  That's his weight?  I'm sorry.  Never, Jimmy.  It's almost once time.  It always reminds me.  Why 11.59?  Chip Ruth.  I love playing for the Yankees.  It's like living in the moment and stuff.  Like, time's almost up, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  You know, you'll be fine, right?  You're supposed to be okay?  With fucking Norton's farts, I might not make it to say.  That's true.  Dude, I hope you're okay.  But if that did affect you and you died on the stage, I would be a legend in comedy.  Comedian kills an ill man with farts.  Well, good luck, man.  We hope you're okay.  Yeah, really.  For real.  Is it benign or malignant?  Is it pretend?  God damn, he took a line. 
[01:12:30]  It's benign.  Oh, John Benign Ramsey or something.  I don't know.  You guys run.  Oh, that's not funny.  She passed away.  That's very sad.  Sam, we got another contestant.  Oh, Sam.  Why do you say that?  I don't know.  Because you're an asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  She got angry anything today.  Jesus.  No one's safe.  All right.  Who do we got?  What's your name, bro?  My name's Alex.  Hi, Alex.  Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's up, Alex?  Where are you from?  I'm from Chicago. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  Oh.  Bobby Hill.  What do you do for a living?  I work out of my house.  Oh.  All right.  Nice and vague.  I picked up a drug dealer.  Yeah, what do you do?  I write blogs.  We all work.  Yeah, I know.  It's a shit job.  You know, this guy's just an asshole.  And I write a blog, so that means it's true.  No, he's a nice guy.  What do you do besides PSA for Down syndrome?  What do you think?  Oh, oh, oh.  He looks a little fat guy. 
[01:13:30]  Now it's mean Jimmy.  I was kidding.  I didn't mean that.  That's okay.  So what Jimmy said was,  Monday is good.  I'm sorry, why?  Oh, man, that's pretty good.  That was good.  What do you do, sir?  What's that great?  That velvet hair.  That's nice.  Thanks.  I do my own hair.  It looks good, man.  Thank you.  Full head.  All right.  You got a chip impression?  No.  What?  All right.  Okay.  I thought the contest was a look-alike,  not a...  Oh, you know something?  He was asked to kind of have a chip look to him. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, but you have to do the voice, too.  You got to do the voice, too.  Let's try the voice, but do the face.  And try the voice.  Good radio.  Show the audience.  Yeah, good radio.  Exactly.  Yeah, I know.  Right?  Do the face.  Great radio.  He's not wrong.  If I could describe what he looked like, picture trying to take a shit after a lot of fiber.  Stop playing with yourself.  Yes, sir.  They're implying that your hands are in your khaki shorts and you're playing pocket pool.  Yeah, they think you're...  Oh, you're playing with yourself. 
[01:14:30]  Are you nervous?  Are you?  A little bit.  All right, do a chip.  What the hell?  Go ahead.  Face the crowd.  Let the crowd see you, man.  They're supportive.  Fuck you!  Oh, that always helps.  Yeah, right?  They say fuck you to the huge crowd.  Then they go, yeah, well, he got us.  I've got nothing.  Obviously.  I just, I don't know.  I just got nothing. 
[01:15:00]  I think we found a winner.  You suck.  You suck.  Oh, shit.  That sounded like Chip J. Bullock.  All right.  You suck!  You suck!  You suck!  You suck!  What a waste of time.  All contrast thoughts.  Sam, is that it?  It's a slow burn.  The thing is, ever since $500 we've put on the line, everybody now does a Chip and Proud.  Is that Coke?  Coke Logic?  Coke Logic!  Holy shit! 
[01:15:30]  Coke Logic!  It's fucking Coke Logic.  Come on up here.  Coke Logic has been doing animations for the Opie and Anthony show for fucking years.  Yeah, I know.  What does he think?  He's a bunch of Pepsi products or something?  This dude is, uh...  Ugh.  This dude is very talented and rarely leaves his house.  Yeah, he's a shut-in.  He kind of is a shut-in.  Oh.  Oh.  What's up, Coke Logic?  Make him stand right here.  Sorry to climb up here.  There's a good douchebag in a wheelchair.  Oh!  I had to fucking climb around him. 
[01:16:00]  Wait, turn around.  What should I do?  Turn around so people can see you.  Turn around.  Hey, what's up, Chicago?  Chicago!  Chicago!  Chicago!  Chicago!  What the fuck is up?  This guy loves animations, drinking, and I think Pearl Jam, right?  I love Pearl Jam, animation, and the Opie and Anthony show.  And drinking.  Let's not forget the drinking part.  And taking the mic away from Sam Roberts, which gives me free control to just say anything 
[01:16:30]  I want.  He really did just grab the mic.  Oh, wow.  Bad, right?  Right?  Right, Danny?  Look, the whole...  All right, look.  Jimmy just took out the whole front row with a fart.  Jimmy walked to the front of the stage and told me he was going to fart, and he did.  And the whole crowd is waving.  It's like the wave.  But they're part of fight.  It stopped me dead in my tracks.  Jimmy, for the next one, you've got to go in the middle of the crowd.  I want to see everyone just...  Oh, Jimmy, you should.  Just go right into the crowd.  I want to see what happens.  No, because that would be embarrassing. 
[01:17:00]  Co-clots, you got anything else before your moment is over?  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  What do you got?  It looks like you brought gifts.  Well, not gifts.  That happens at Christmas time, and you know I'm always good.  Even if it's a Rich Voss signed CD that is given away on the after show.  And that was a plug for your show.  What I have...  I think he's losing the crowd.  RichVoss.com!  You're losing the crowd.  You're losing the crowd.  What I have is a look for Chip Chipperson. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, oh.  Like a mullet?  That is a hat with a mullet.  Hey, you're ripping me off.  Hoo-hoo.  All right, look.  I need a haircut.  I understand.  And a look.  Oh, Jimmy.  If I can get this fucking thing going here.  Did that hair come off a human being?  I'm a little worried here.  This is my...  This is perfect for the radio, by the way.  I have a look for Chip Chipperson.  Oh, shit.  He already has the animation for Chip.  Oh, man.  That's very good.  It's not radio, but it really looks like a good version of Chip. 
[01:18:00]  So...  That's pretty fucking good.  And now that he's wearing the actual shit that's in the animation, this might be the...  That is...  Did you see this?  The Chippa look.  Wow.  Fuck.  No one's going to beat that.  We should fucking go to break or something.  Oh, no.  No.  What?  No.  Oh, man.  We just came back.  Chip, you like that?  I like your Harry Pot roast glasses.  All right.  You get it.  I fucking feel it's cool, man.  You like it? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  You like your long hair like that?  Fucking A.  Fucking A, call me a...  Notice the brim is out of the way of the expressions.  And it's green with envy.  Oh, it's green with envy.  He called up everything.  He called up everything.  You did think of stuff.  Hey, Chip, what does the hat actually say?  I don't know.  I can't read it.  What, are my eyes up there or something?  Oh, go to break.  Oh, no, no, no.  Please don't do that.  Oh, that's good.  I love watching another functional alcoholic.  That's great. 
[01:19:00]  We'll be doing some drinking, man.  Oh, we have been.  Oh, I have been as well.  Yeah, that's what I was getting at, actually.  Fist it.  All right.  Boom.  Coke Logic.  Always a pleasure.  Coke Logic, everyone.  That's a good one, right?  Very good.  We've done some great shit for the O&A show.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  An amazing animation.  And you might come up with the Chip look.  I don't know.  The hat says Barbista and Babe, and it's a coffee cup, and it says, Caution, Contents Extremely Hot.  Ah, I see, because Chip. 
[01:19:30]  If they're hot, it must be sick fucking puppy CDs.  Oh, shit.  No one likes that band.  Sam, is that it?  Do we have any more?  We could literally do this for the rest of the show.  Well, we don't have a lady.  What else are we doing?  All right.  A couple more.  Oh.  We do have $500.  Oh, man.  Everybody call.  Farley Reincarnated.  Oh, shit.  Right there.  Brian Dennehy, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, man.  How you doing?  Oh, my God. 
[01:20:00]  What's your name and where you from?  John from Chicago.  You are a character actor.  You really look like 20 different people I've seen movies and television.  He looks like the cop in Dog Day Afternoon.  Just keep us all drinks.  Keep us all drinks.  Wow.  All right.  John from Chicago.  All right, John.  What do you do here?  I am a carpenter.  All right.  All right.  John's a fucking man's man. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Were you framing out a house?  Yep.  Were you doing the sheetrock down at the fucking McDonald's?  On the high rise.  On the high rise?  Were you guys set up some scaffolding?  Scaffling it is.  Yeah, of course.  I love a real man.  Real big man.  Do you do Chris Farley?  I almost feel like you can.  Really?  You do Chris Farley?  In a van down by the river.  I guess you don't.  Face the audience.  Wait.  John, you got to face the crowd.  They can see you.  They have to see your face because it's not just about us.  Yes. 
[01:21:00]  Let the crowd see you.  We're really going to try this again?  The smoking dude ain't going to do nothing for you.  You know what?  All right.  That was bad.  That was bad.  That was bad.  You're going to end up in a van down by the river.  See?  The face really makes it.  Again, for radio.  And you want to do Chip, too?  I do Chip.  All right.  Face the crowd and let them see.  I do Chip. 
[01:21:30]  I do Chip.  Can I talk to the girl from New York?  Chip Farley.  Oh, my God.  Chip Farley.  That's also his Reagan.  It's your garbage.  Get her down that wall.  Do you know the difference between a blowjob and a ham sandwich?  I know the difference.  What is it, Chip?  Well, a ham sandwich.  I'm a glove for a ham sandwich.  Oh, my God.  We get it.  How long would you talk over that? 
[01:22:00]  I thought you meant me.  All right.  What's the difference between...  No, what's the difference?  No one heard it.  What's the joke?  Biff Cannon?  Yeah.  What was the...  No?  I've been fooled before.  Take your goddamn hands off.  You all right?  All right.  Let's hear it for this guy.  Yeah, he did a nice job.  This guy.  You know someone's memorable when you call him this guy.  Now, miss, what are you trying to... 
[01:22:30]  Hold on.  This lady's trying to tell me something.  He does Chip good?  Who is he to you?  Are you lying?  Is that...  All right.  Let's try.  Get down there with the legs.  Sam, what's the matter?  Are you a big star now?  You can't go into the crowd?  Yeah, who's this pretty girl?  Let's try it.  Let's try it.  Where's your boyfriend, miss?  Oh, good.  All right.  Now, me and Jimmy are going to be like lions and fight.  Why would we be lying?  I'll tell the truth.  Why do I get booed immediately? 
[01:23:00]  For your tablecloth shirt, perhaps.  He goes, why did I get booed immediately?  You were added...  I have a chance to happen.  All right.  What's your name?  Where are you from?  Jordan Boyle from Philadelphia.  Now I live in Chicago.  Nice.  There you go.  Philly.  Represented.  Philly to Chicago.  Let's hear your Chip.  Huh?  Tablecloth shirt.  Is that what you said?  No, I didn't say that.  It's like a picnic table or something.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's like my mother said.  My mother said, Chip, you need to tell me every once in a while you need to do something  twice, you get a picnic table or you have a shirt. 
[01:23:30]  You know, what are you going to say?  Oh, well, I...  Wow.  Sounds just like me.  Not.  Holy shit.  Did you like that, Bob Kelly?  What did you think?  Yeah, don't turn around and look for somebody.  It's you, motherfucker.  It is you.  I love that the guy is like, hey, he's like, I want to laugh too.  Where is the asshole?  Oh, shit, it's me.  That was hilarious. 
[01:24:00]  He was praying, though.  You can see it on his face.  That's not me.  Oh, shit, it's me.  You know what, dude?  I don't have a bandolier.  Yeah, I don't got a bandolier.  I don't have a bandolier.  But I'm here with my shirt.  Boom.  I'm standing front row.  I'm talking to Chicago.  I bought you a shot.  Did Anthony...  No, Anthony did the shot.  No, Anthony did the shot.  No, that one spilled.  Oh, by the way, Anthony needs another shot of Jägermeister.  Oh, there it is, Anthony.  I might do another one.  All right, so we have a few chips. 
[01:24:30]  You spitting this?  Sam, we got one more?  We'll do one more chip.  There's got to be another chip.  I'm praying we can salvage this.  Yeah, right?  All right, who's this?  Name and where you from, brother?  Jeff from Chicago, Midway.  Welcome, Jeff.  All right, Chicago, Midway.  Hey, Chicago, Midway.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that good?  I think it's good.  Yeah.  Let's hear your chip.  All right, you got one of those guinea horns?  I do.  Do you have a fucking guinea...  I got one of those hats, too, by the way. 
[01:25:00]  Hey, I got a hat.  I got a guinea horn.  Yeah, he's real.  I'm a fucking Italian from Chicago, you cuck.  What do you got there?  You are a fucking guinea.  I am.  I know.  You have my last shit.  My last name's Underhill, though, so what the hell?  Oh, he's got the...  Yeah, but when he came from Italy, it was Underhilliani.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Underhill...  Oh, anyway.  Hey, there...  Oh, fuck.  I think Chippa...  Hold on, before I go off...  Sometimes the softballs, I swing and miss that.  Chippa... 
[01:25:30]  Jesus, Chippa.  All right.  Where's your moment, finally?  Underhill, I was like, I knew I had something.  Fucking golly.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, so Chippa's been, you know, studying up on his science and whatnot, and NASA just sent  the Curiosity to Mars.  What's next?  They're going to send, like, by Curiosity to explore Uranus or something?  Double gun, baby.  Double gun.  Hey, nobody can hear the fucking snort.  I can do the snort.  Oh. 
[01:26:00]  I did the snort.  No one's done the snort.  You're like a triple threat or a quadruple one of someone?  What are we in?  We in Illinois?  Is everyone, like, sick or something?  Oh, shit.  Chippa's been his man.  He's not stopping.  He's not stopping.  He's not stopping.  Hey, no, no.  Hey, Chicago.  More like Chicago stop or something, right?  Oh, shit.  Chippa's getting his ass kicked.  Chippa, he's kicking your ass.  Chippa.  Hey, fuck you, cock chucker.  Chippa.  Come on, Chippa.  Come on, Chippa.  Come on, you would do this.  What's your...

You got to walk around in glasses or something to get around?  Oh, shit.  He's got it.  Double gun.  What's...  Oh, I'm on fire, Chippa.  Wait.  What's the...  What's the B on...  Double gun, baby.  What's the B on your hat stand for?  Birds or something?  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Come on, Chippa.  He's owning you.  Yeah, well, you got... 
[01:27:00]  You got, like, khaki shorts on.  How come...  Yeah, it's because I shop at cold.  Because that's the only clothes that fit or something.  He's kicking you all.  He's killing you, Chippa.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I got it, Chippa.  What's the B stand for on your hat or something?  That's like Chicago Bears or something, but I also like the Jets.  Oh, yeah, the Chicago Bears.  What are your...  Oh, my...  Oh, come on, Chippa.  Chippa's getting owned.  Fuck.  Oh, Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Come on, Chippa.  Come on, Chippa. 
[01:27:30]  You got something for me, Chippa?  Okay, I got one.  I got one.  I hope you killed the car accident, you cocksucker.  Yeah!  Angry Chipp.  Chipp doesn't know how to real...  Fuck you.  I don't give a fuck.  Hey, what the fuck, cocksucker?  What the fuck?  Oh, shit.  He's owning you, Chippa.  What are you going to talk like this all the time?  What are you going to be like?  I don't know.  My mother told me, don't use that type of language, Chippa.  I'm just trying to sound like you.  I'm not you.  I'm not you.  What's the B stand for?  A big hat or something? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  This is fucking...  A behind or something.  This is embarrassing.  Chippa, you're embarrassing everybody.  Oh, yeah?  Maybe I could put a C hat on, and then we could be B.C.  like we're before Christ.  Whoa.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Was that too religious?  Poor Chippa.  Oh, that was a fucking fantastic.  I think, Chippa, Sam, I think we got a winner.  Holy shit.  I think we got a winner, right?  Well, so to speak.  I mean, winner's a loose term. 
[01:28:30]  All right, what do you guys think?  Should we line them up and see what you want?  I don't even think we need to fucking line people up.  I like this guy.  This guy's got it.  Holy shit.  You just won $500, courtesy of the Opie and Anthony Show, and I guess 115 Burberry Street.  Thank you very much.  Very good.  That was very good.  Yeah, get a little picture with the photographer guy.  It's a complete pain in the air.  By the way, CM Punk on his way?  That's kind of cool.  Is he on his way? 
[01:29:00]  CM Punk on his way.  We're going to do the oddest thing you own or brought to 115 Burberry Street.  We'll do that after the break.  I might even take a piss.  Let's take pisses.  We'll be back.  We'll be right back.  Let's let everybody know you're having a good time.  Thank you, brother.  Thank you.  O&A, live from Chicago, next.

[01:30:00]  here in Marionette Park, Illinois.  Very, very large crowd.  I didn't know what we were going to get here.  I think we're all very, very happy with the turnout.  Oh, hell yeah.  We weren't sure if we were a draw in Chicago, but I think we are.  I think we do pretty well in Chicago.  And I want to thank the people at 115 Bourbon Street.  They're awesome.  They really are.  They're really great.  We got to spend 15 seconds and kiss their ass for a few minutes.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  You guys want to do the surprises?  Well, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Got a couple surprises.  I wouldn't say the first one.  I don't want to get their hopes up.  It's just a little thing we did.  Can I talk into this one, Sam?  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, are you in for a fucking treat?  You don't even know.  Let me ask the crowd this.  Do you guys like music?  You like music?

[01:34:30]  Mimi Beardsley!  I fucking...  Yeah?  I did say that the audience should have the lyrics, too, so they could sing along.  Well, they know the Mimi Beardsley part, and that is the most important part.  I know that.  I felt they should have...  No.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley!  Would you eat my ass?  Like a true Kennedy.  That was great.  Yeah.  Maybe you needed some whiskey before you did, like, a real...  Oh, Mimi Beardsley!  Would you eat my ass?  Like a true Kennedy.  That was great.  Yeah.

That was good.  You know what?  I did a great job.  I went to that casino last night.  I saw some shenanigans.  And, uh...  I think Anthony wants to sing a song for everybody.  I did see some shenanigans and hijinks.  You did, huh?  And I'm just thinking maybe I can kind of convey...  Oh, shit.  Uh, maybe a...  Maybe a belief I have.  And, uh, I want to dedicate this to Michigan's own fat fuck.

[01:38:00]  E-Rock is your old factory all tuned up.  Ready to go?  We were very worried about E-Rock.  He almost didn't make it here today.  Oh, man.  Yeah, the plane was overloaded.  Oh, see what happened there?  E-Rock.  Did you see what happened?  Ladies and gentlemen, can we have every other passenger besides Eric Nagel get on the right side of the aircraft?  We seem to be on a left-hand turn the entire flight. 
[01:38:30]  Anyone else notice that E-Rock's not even that fat?  That's the beauty.  He's not all that fat anymore.  But like Bob Kelly over here, we don't care.  We just keep...  Oh, well, you want to look behind you and see what I'm talking about?  He's looking this time.  He knows now.  E-Rock, you ready to judge the contest?  I'm ready.  All right.  How many contestants?  We have at least two, but we need to find that...  Two?  At least two?  How much money do we have to give away?  $500.  $500? 
[01:39:00]  Does anyone else have bad breath?  What is that idiot that almost got kicked out a bunch of times?  Oh, man.  He probably got kicked out by now.  Yeah.  He did get kicked out?  If someone even just wants to win money and wants to eat that chick's ass, just come up  here.  I'm already here.  Oh.  You know, we could go rogue and go for smelly pussies, too, today.  Oh, my God.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  I thought that was the after party at the hotel.  What?  What?  I'm insane. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  We got three.  Three contestants?  Yeah.  Do any ladies maybe have some smell going on?  Just to get the contest going?  Are you out of your minds?  What do you mean to get on stage and show Eric?  We can't get more than five women to show up.  You think the ones I do are going to show their badges?  But he's kind of right.  They probably all do stink.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we're teasing, of course.  Are you with that white woman?  Oh, sorry.  I was ready to call security. 
[01:40:00]  And I was ready to jerk off.  They called me old 1940s Anthony.  You know, I was born.  And, you know, he could be Obama's son.  You know, if I had a son, he'd look like you.  Looked just like you, sir.  All right.  Oh, come on.  Get that guy an iced tea.  Hold on.  All right.  We get it.  Hold on.  Instead of calling me crazy, is there any women that want to, like, I don't know.  Any women waffling a little bit tonight?  Oh, B's drunk. 
[01:40:30]  Well, not really.  Oh, B's drunk.  I'll play a little.  Oh, B's drunk.  All right.  Look.  We need the contestants and the nose, E-Rock, to get up here and start judging this bad breath  contest.  My God.  Oh, there you are, E-Rock.  Hi, E-Rock.  I didn't see you.  I should have known because the stage was leaning to the right.  Leaning to the right.  The stage was leaning to the right.  My throat hurts from singing Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, big old fatso. 
[01:41:00]  He's on the stage.  He's such an awesome.  Wanted to take a later flight.  Big old.  Jimmy, you didn't realize there was a lot of Mimi Beardsleys in that song, huh?  There was a lot of Mimi Beardsleys in that song, Jimmy.  I couldn't believe how many Mimi Beardsleys in a row they wanted a sweet boy to sing.  There might have been 20 too many.  Oh, it's endless.  Holy fuck.  I got it, Mimi Beardsley.  I heard you, Mimi Beardsley.  I read it.  I read it.  It's about it.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You're not going to hurt us, sir, are you? 
[01:41:30]  Your shirt's like black with envy.  Oh, it's a different color.  I had a 50-50 shot like that.  Yeah, green.  What is that?  The green Hornet sweatshirt that he wears when it's chilly or something?  Oh, too long.  All right.  What's your name, sir?  My name's Michael.  I'm from Chicago.  Face the audience a little bit, Michael.  What are you doing?  Michael's from Chicago.  Your teeth look very white, so I would imagine your breath isn't that bad.  You didn't brush your teeth for a while, or what did you do?  Yeah, but I've also been smoking and drinking, so if I just smell like alcohol and cigarettes 
[01:42:00]  right now, I apologize.  Way to keep it away.  Okay.  All right.  E-Rock is the sole judge of this.  Yeah, E-Rock is the judge, and there's a $500 cash prize.  That's a lot, so if you want to, you know, bop for shit in the toilet and then come back,  feel free.  You've got some time.  All right.  All righty.  E-Rock?  E-Rock, please.  Step up.  Let's go, E-Rock.  And, sir, just breathe slowly, steadily, right on his nose.  You've probably taken a lot of D-We tests in your life. 
[01:42:30]  Do it the same way.  Yes.  Right on his nose.  E-Rock, a nice breath in.  Oh, E-Rock laughs at you.  I think you could get a date with the guy, never mind offending him.  Holy shit.  I think he liked it.  That was a little too close.  He's very cuddly.  You want to hug E-Rock?  E-Rock, give him a hug.  Oh, that's adorable.  Wow.  He does like it.  You know what?  He must have seen that Facebook picture with your bedroom eyes. 
[01:43:00]  All right, come here.  Yeah, I'm married, but I'm looking.  Why don't you tell us to shut up?  Why don't you tell us to shut up?  Why don't you come back here and shut up?  Fucking told them.  What's him?  Even in front of this crowd, do you know how confident he was during the pre-show?  Oh, shit.  So confident.  He rocked her in the pre-show.  And now he won't say a word.  It's so weird how that happened.  We hate confident E-Rock.  Actually, we just hate E-Rock.  That's kind of the way it goes. 
[01:43:30]  All right, so far this contest.  That guy was nothing.  Oh, this guy.  All right.  Where are you from?  Hi, I'm Steve from Chicago.  Ah, Steve from Chicago.  I like being a lot of bratwurst.  Some of that fucking deep dish pizza.  Yeah, I put on an accent, but I don't really got stuff.  No, you don't get stuff.  Good work.  No feedback at all.  Oh, wow.  This guy is fucking...  What an asshole.  I like this guy.  And did you do anything special to make your breath heinous? 
[01:44:00]  I am related to my mother.  In what way?  What does that mean?  Maybe mommy stinks.  Yeah, I don't really know what that means either.  What does that mean?  Do you not like your mommy?  Unfortunately.  All of a sudden, I just got this vision of oral sex with her.  Oh!  Come on.  A pooner breath.  Why don't you like your mom?  Well, I love her.  She's great.  But she fell on her head in 92 and hasn't had a sense of smell since.  She fell on her head.  No sense of smell.  Since 92. 
[01:44:30]  Did she fall on her head or did she fall on your dad's knuckles?  I dreamt.  Oh, wow.  Hey, you never know.  That is a good question.  She talked during the fucking Bears game.  Fuck that cut.  Oh, man.  She was drinking during the Bears game.  She lost her sense of smell forever.  Lost her sense of smell for the last 20 years.  Wow.  20 years.  The bitch smells terrible.  She doesn't know?  She smells awful.  She doesn't know it.  She's watching around smiling.  That must be great.  Get on with it. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Breathe into E-Rock's face.  E-Rock, if you would step right up.  You ready for this, E-Rock?  Again.  Breathe slowly and steadily right into E-Rock's snout.  Hi, E-Rock.  How are you?  There's nothing there.  Nothing.  Wow.  We got a bunch of clean mouths here.  Oh.  What's this, like, a 10-team commercial and fountain?  Get off our stage.  Get out of here with your hygiene.  I don't think it did.  Yeah, we're mad because he has good blood.  Get out of here with your self-respect. 
[01:45:30]  You're no-smelling mother-motherfucker.  Sam, we got one more contestant.  So far, this is a bust.  Yeah, this guy.  Dude, all it has to be is one person that stinks.  Oh, this guy is actually putting a stinger down his throat.  Oh, yeah.  All right, this guy's a problem.  A very big dude.  Well, he's liking a compound show, so he obviously likes a show that stinks.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he just puked.  He just stuck his fingers down his throat.  He puked in a cup.  E-Rock's coming over now.  He's going to breathe in E-Rock's face.  Oh, E-Rock's going up. 
[01:46:00]  E-Rock's beating.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The catastrophe.  Oh, the humanity.  Oh, he's growing up bile in a cup.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock's growing up now.  Oh, wait a minute.  What happened?  Wait, what happened?  Oh, the guy's puking.  He made E-Rock puke.  He's licking bile off his fingers.  This is terrible. 
[01:46:30]  E-Rock's not going to be...  He's not being a good judge.  You're not being a good judge.  Shut the fuck up.  You're not being a good judge.  You're not being a good judge.  You're not being a good judge.  All right, here we go.  Wow.  Make it official.  Make it official.  So far, he's in the lead.  He put his fingers down his throat.  He puked up this viscous brown fucking fluid.  One more time.  Into a cup.  One more time.  One more time.  Wait, hold on.  One more time.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:47:00]  Right up front.  Right up front.  Wait, let him puke into a cup.  And then maybe if we want to get somebody else to smell that at the end, we can do that.  Oh, there's a good idea.  You're welcome.  Oh, he's puking.  E-Rock, everyone's looking for...  He's putting his fingers down his throat.  Oh, everyone's looking for their phone.  Oh, he's probably sure to pay himself.  All right, one more time.  Very bile-y puke he's got there.  He's a very tall, big guy.  One more time, E-Rock.  Oh, that reminds me.  Could someone get me a mudslide?  Pestgaming.com, fuck B-Man.  All right. 
[01:47:30]  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  One more time, E-Rock.  Now breathe into E-Rock's face.  No, let E-Rock smell the cup.  Let E-Rock smell the cup.  Oh.  E-Rock's dry heaving.  He's dry heaving.  Oh, God damn.  E-Rock.  Look at the cup and...  E-Rock's in E-Rock.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[01:48:00]  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  If only you could make that a habit,  maybe you'd be human weight.  Move that cup down on the floor.  I don't want to look at that.  What do you guys think of that, huh?  Wow.  Sam.  Hey, Sam.  Hey, Sam.  Smell that cup.  How bad does that smell?  Just tell me if it's bad or not.  Smell it.  Just smell it.  All right, Sam.  Give it a sniff.  Give it a sniff.  Sam's dry heaving.  Oh, he's dry heaving. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, come on.  How bad could it be?  You don't like bile-y...  No, no.  I swear to God, I'll shoot you.  Put it on toast like apple butter.  No!  I hope it made like it was...  Wait, you'll do it?  Wait, we got some of those.  We got some more.  Let's do some more bad breath.  Do it. 
[01:49:00]  Do it.  Do it.  Smell it.  What do you need?  Get up on stage.  Get up on stage.  Do it before...  This motherfucker wants to drink it.  No, no.  He's gonna drink it.  Go ahead.  He's gonna drink this guy's puke.  He's gonna drink this guy's puke.  He's gonna drink this guy's...  He drank it.  Oh, God!  Oh, fuck!  He drank the puke.  Oh, fuck!  Yeah!  Now, E-Rock, you guys smell his breath.  Ha-ha.  We did it before you knew. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, my God.  It's only finished.  Oh, they came out from the back room.  I saw them.  What?  They came out from the back.  Ha-ha.  We beat you.  Ha-ha.  We beat you.  Management was trying to shut that down.  There we go.  Just so you know.  There's fucking lawyers with subpoenas trying to serve us right now.  All right, E-Rock.  So, this guy drank the puke.  Now, you smell his breath.  It's only fair.  E-Rock?  Smell his breath.  He burnt you.  Oh!  Not as bad as the original puke guy, right?  All right.  All right.  All right.  No.  Holy shit. 
[01:50:00]  That guy should get something.  What's his name?  Oh, they're getting a sign of release.  He has a sign of release.  If you get AIDS, you probably came to see the show.  If you get AIDS, I'm going to see.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  Really?  That guy's got some constitution.  That's brutal.  Oh, they love clubs out of Kenny.  You guys, we're going to take a very quick break, I promise. 
[01:50:30]  Don't go anywhere.  And then we got to.  Now, this guy says no, Opie.  But we got no surprise for you right around the corner.  Ooh.  And it's a good surprise.  And are we going to announce the winner after the break?  I think it's that guy.  Wait, can I ask you?  Is it that guy or the first guy who puked or the guy who drank the guy's puke?  I forgot the first guy.  Can I ask you something, though?  Are we taking a break because we're going to get yelled at?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Do we have any more contestants, though?  Any more contestants?  Oh, man.  Wait, we got another bad breath guy right here.  Yeah.  Oh, what do you got in your mouth?  Bring him up.  You know, we're not going to take him. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, man.  Let him come up here.  Yeah, make sure his mouth is empty.  If someone can somehow get the essence of Sam's After Show in their mouth, instant winner.  Because it's literally shit.  All right.  Oh, Sam.  By the way, weekdays at 10 a.m.  Catch the After Show at Sam.  Here we go.  I listen every day.  Go ahead, sir.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Well, no, nothing.  Wow.  Nothing.  Hey, hey, fresh breath. 
[01:51:30]  Get the fuck off this thing.  Boo.  Boo.  You and your stupid fucking...  Here we go.  Fucking...  Get out of here.  You Lavoris motherfucker.  Get out of here with you fresh breath and dressed fucking asshole.  All right.  Sam, we got a winner?  Colgate and shithead.  Well, you tell me.  Is the winner because...  Well, the guy that drank the puke was just extra.  That was great.  That was just sexy.  That was just sexy.  The guy who puked had the worst breath, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's up to E-Rock, really.  Yeah, the guy sporting the live from the compound shirt.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:52:00]  He's the winner.  I know that guy likes stuff that stinks.  Hey, hold on.  Do you think we should have an Encore?  Encore!  I mean, the guy's long and all.  Get him a cup.  Get him a cup.  Opie is like a dairy farmer.  He will milk the shit out of anything.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  You're doing it for 30 years.  All right.  This guy...  He's vomiting a cup.  There's a lime in this one.  There's a lime in that one.  He just ate the fucking lime.  All right. 
[01:52:30]  Here's your Encore.  Here's the guy that won the Bad Breath Contest.  You can't get it?  Look at E-Rock's face.  Yeah, your body looks like it sucks up everything you put in it.  It's probably hard to puke, right?  E-Rock, face the crowd.  This is a photo op for everyone on Twitter.  Photo op.  It's like when you're driving around the Grand Canyon.  You've got to pull off and take a shot.  Break out your cameras.  Here's your photo op.  You're all dry.  The lofting taste of bile. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Look, I've had it with you puking people.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  We're at 115 Bourbon Street, Marionette Park.  We'll be here for at least another hour.  Yeah, don't go anywhere.  A quick break and another surprise for everybody.  Stay there.  You're listening to the O.P. Anthony Show.  Live from Chicago.  Live from Chicago.  Chicago.  Live from Chicago.  More. 
[01:53:30]  More.  Next.  Live from Chicago.  This is the O.P. Anthony Show.  All right, Chicago.  Yeah.  Where is Jimmy?  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy's, um...  Jimmy's hanging out.  Jimmy is hanging.  Having a good time in Chicago.  There he is. 
[01:54:00]  Hi, Jimmy.  All right.  You guys having a good time or what?  Fuck, we're having a blast.  We got a friend that stopped by and wants to say hi and join the festivities.  Yeah, it is CM Punk.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it is CM Punk.  Chicago's own CM Punk.  Fuck, yeah.  Fuck, yeah.  There he is. 
[01:54:30]  Man, you are a Chicago guy.  I'm surprised that in this large crowd of drinkers, anybody knows who I am.  Yeah, right.  I know this much.  Sam has a boner right now.  I know, and I'm standing up.  You have a boner, right?  I'm standing up.  You have a boner.  Sam, stay on that end of the table.  Stay away from me.  Are you afraid of Sam like all the rest of the wrestlers are?  Because he's very aggressive with being your friend.  No, he's harmless.  Exactly.  Well, obviously.  I'm not afraid of him.  He's just so strange looking.  He really is.  Take that, Sam.  Is he a little creepy? 
[01:55:00]  He's a little...  Is this a yarmulke?  Yeah, somebody threw that up.  This is awesome.  Oh, wow.  We should just drink beer out of that.  Is that...  Could that be a problem?  I don't even know.  I think it'd actually be easier to eat, like, peanuts out of.  Beer's probably more sacrilegious, though.  Yeah, does anybody have food we can eat out of this yarmulke?  Who threw the yarmulke up, by the way?  Where are you, sir?  I'm here.  That's all it takes to give up your religion?  An ONA show?  Yeah.  I don't blame you, sir.  Now, what made you do that?  I wanted people not to hate me, so I threw out my beer's cap. 
[01:55:30]  Then I wanted people to hate me, so I threw out my yarmulke.  Wow.  Let my people see tits.  All right.  Well, thank you very much, sir.  CM, do you want...  Oh, you don't drink.  That's right.  You don't drink at all.  Good.  Nope.  What happened there?  Was it an early thing that you were drinking?  You fucked up?  No, I just...  Jimmy was something I never got into.  You never got into?  No.  I watched a lot of stupid stuff go down by the time I was 15.  Hey, look.  I never knew you.  Don't fucking say that.  You want to see stupid stuff going down?  There was a lot of it already today. 
[01:56:00]  We had a guy...  I'm waiting for more.  Yeah, that man vomited into a cup, and then that man drank it.  What a lovely audience.  You like this audience, CM?  Absolutely.  All right, good.  They look familiar, don't they?  These are the same audience.  These are my people.  This is Chicago.  Now, by the way, the guy in the wheelchair, obviously you had an injury.  We didn't talk to you yet.  What happened to you?  Uh-oh.  I wiped out of my motorcycle.  Oh, wiped out of your motorcycle.  So, you're going to be okay.  Hey!  Hey!  I was jumping over the fucking hamburgers. 
[01:56:30]  That's not good.  Chicken, very good.  It's the Black Fonz.  So, are you going to be okay?  Yeah.  No, two more months.  Two more months.  What actually happened to you?  The bone on this side came out of the skin.  Nice.  This side fractured.  Oh, compound fracture?  Yeah, compound fracture.  And what happened?  You were riding your bike and someone hit you?  No, the guy in front of me jammed on his brakes.  So, I jammed on mine and ate it.  And then you skidded out.  Following too closely, sir.  Yes.  No more bike for you?  There was a girl in the red dress across the street. 
[01:57:00]  That's why.  Oh!  I guess we all were looking over there and that's what they did.  Looking at it.  Are you going to get back on your bike?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Once I get it fixed.  Alright, that's smart.  That would deter me.  I flipped a moped when I was 15 years old.  And I've never gotten anything with two wheels again.  You put the mo in moped.  Wait a minute.  Wait, hold on a second.  That's a gay reference.  I don't care for that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I did.  I flipped it over and I said I will never ride a motorcycle.  You weren't riding a motorcycle. 
[01:57:30]  Yes, I was.  That's a fucking moped.  At 15, that was a motorcycle.  Oh, God.  With pedals.  A motorcycle does not have pedals.  Hey, Anthony, this guy's trying to give you another shot.  He might have had enough, sir.  Look at him.  He's like, oh, hey.  He just said, hey.  He might have had enough.  He said, fuck you up.  He might have had enough.  I don't want to interrupt.  Is Obi cutting me off?  No, no.  Of course not.  Are you kidding?  Hey, hey.  Oh, hey.  Hey, look.  Hey.  Hey, look.  Mommy.  I think I can fucking have a shot.  Alright.  Alright. 
[01:58:00]  A drink for Anthony of God knows what that fucking psychopath put in it.  You're a Brit.  Would you take a beverage from a fan, CM?  Me?  No.  Hell no.  No, I wouldn't either.  It's liquid obnoxious.  I'm good.  I have a water.  Alright, cheers, my friend.  Cheers.  I'm not going to clink the glass with you.  What are we?  Fucking cheers.  Something?  Ran out of steam there, didn't I?  I was going to say, I mean, if you thought that something was slipping in there.  You said you were going to say, but now you're saying it.  Yeah, that's true.  You said I was going to say, and then he's not saying it.  He looks like an individual who would know what Halcyon is, so I would be very cautious 
[01:58:30]  in drinking anything he hands you.  Hey, are you doing a signing or something?  Are you plugging something at Comic-Con?  Yeah, I'll be at Comic-Con all day tomorrow.  It's called Wizard World, I think.  I think Comic-Con's a separate place.  Wizard drink.  Yes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  So if you want to go see CM Punk and get a photo or whatever, he will be there.  Are you doing photos?  I'll be there all day doing photos, whatever.  That'd be funny.  If you pay me enough, I'll probably do anything.  I'm like Jim. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, that's if I usually pay for it.  I've never been paid for anything sexual.  That's a shame.  I know.  I would love it.  I like the fucking, like, the mutton chop.  You look like if Lemmy went back in a time machine.  I look like a young Lemmy?  Yeah, you look like...  Is that my future?  That's what I have to look forward to?  Unfortunately.  Am I going to degenerate that bad?  Well, hell, if I live as long as him.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, you're calling Lemmy old?  He's in his fucking late 60s.  All right, he is.  Let's be honest.  Come on.  Am I calling Lemmy old?  Am I being disrespectful if I say that?  No, you're right.  I did drink with Lemmy once, and you can't... 
[01:59:30]  No.  You cannot drink with that guy.  I watched him...  I was at the Golden God Awards or something like that.  I watched him drink an entire...  Like, a novelty-sized thing of Jack Daniels.  He loves Jack Daniels.  Yeah, no.  It was ridiculous.  It was like...  It was the joke bottle, and he drank the whole thing.  He wanted me to drink with him, so I mixed it with Coke, like a faggot.  And apparently, that's what he called me.  He just drinks it straight.  You'll never drink with him again.  And if you mix Jack with him, you're a piece of shit.  Yeah, he's pickled on the inside.  Yeah, that's why he's still alive. 
[02:00:00]  Lemmy did Down and Dirty with Jim Norton.  He was kind of like the musical guy.  He was in every show.  And in Lemmy's Rider, though...  Like, everybody has a rider.  In Lemmy's Rider, literally all he wants in his dressing room is Jack Daniels and sour cream and onion potato chips.  What a combo.  He is a fucking animal.  His parts must be worse than yours.  He should have been in the bad breath contest.  Hey, you want to do Oddest Thing?  Yes, we have the oddest thing.  With CM?  Yes, CM is here for us. 
[02:00:30]  All right, obviously, we're trying to beat Philly, and this goes back, what, like 10 years ago, 10, 11 years ago,  when a guy brought in a freeze-dried monkey in a bag, CM Punk.  And then, because it's our show, another guy took his heart on it and put it in the mouth.  He got a blowjob from a freeze-dried monkey.  Oh, they brought out a table.  This is, like, fancy.  I was going to say, is that the strange thing somebody owns?  A table with a blue table.  That sucks.  All right, well, actually, this is for our gynecological exams, ladies. 
[02:01:00]  Speculum?  Ah, ha, ha, the girls are laughing.  I lick them like egg beaters.  Ooh, Doc, can I have one?  Sam, it's to you.  Oddest thing you own.  Hopefully, people brought some good stuff.  Danny, who's our first guy?  Oh, Danny's got the list.  Yeah, make sure the mic's going on.  Your mic's on, I heard it.  Can everybody know?  There it is.  No, but is it going out to the audience?  No.  No?  Oh, boo. 
[02:01:30]  How about now?  Oh.  Hello?  That's loud.  That's loud, though.  We got Danny here.  Yeah.  Anybody, anybody?  Hey, can the sound guy...  There we go.  Oh, there we go.  Okay, cool.  Thank you very much.  Are you the radio guy?  Okay, cool.  Everybody...  You look like the guy who was on trial in fucking Devil's Advocate.  Oh.  For abusing the young girl.  Rubbing the bottom of the table lustily.  I say that with affection.  All right. 
[02:02:00]  All right, go ahead, Danny.  Well, we do have a lot of contestants.  Okay, good.  Oh, good.  I don't know if we're going to have a lot of finalists.  Oh, so you're saying a lot of people brought shit.  Oh, you want to...  Yeah.  And by the way, what is first prize?  A thousand dollars.  A thousand dollars.  On myhatestephensinger.com?  We got some cash.  Yes.  Yes.  Wow.  So I guess I'll leave it up to you guys.  And so I'll divvy this list up into like okay stuff and then like the shit of the shit.  Nothing's good?  Well, some stuff is like, what?  We were trying to beat a freeze-dried monkey. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, and I mean, it's not like they didn't know what to bring.  I mean, I think that the contest rules were defined well.  And between the audio that was played on the air, I think everybody knew what they were contending with.  Is there anything Rick would offer more than 25 bucks for on Pawn Stars?  Oh, on Pawn Stars?  I got to frame it.  It's going to be in the shop for a long time.  Depending on the rarity and condition.  It's George Washington's wooden teeth.  You know, they're wood.  If they were enamel, I'd give you a million.  But they're wood. 
[02:03:00]  All right, Rick.  I know you're fucking me.  I'll give you an example of one and then we'll give an example of another.  Should we bring the guy up and let him say what it is?  Yeah, let's bring the guy up and he says what it is.  All right, how about this?  Let's first bring up Logan.  If Logan is here.  Oh, good.  I hope he doesn't run.  Logan!  Why don't you do the Chippa voice and lawful joke?  Please, come to the stage!  Here's Logan.  Oh, here he is.  Don't blow the surprise for everybody right off the bat.  Logan, where are you from, brother? 
[02:03:30]  Normal.  How about you talking to him, Mike?  Oh, sorry.  I'm from Normal, Illinois.  Well, not even good.  Okay, and you brought something for us?  Yes, I brought Pat Boone in a metal mood.  Fucking racist.  That's the weirdest thing you own?  That's the weirdest thing you own?  Sorry, what?  That's the weirdest thing you own?  Well, it was the weirdest thing I owned.  You dug around your house.  And that's all you found?  Well, I didn't know if anybody was bringing anything. 
[02:04:00]  So, $1,000, $1,000.  Well, he was the guy that thought, I'll just bring something and hope I'm the only contestant.  Right, right, right.  Pretty much.  All right.  In a way, that's smart.  I think there's way more skeletons in your closet than a Pat Boone CD.  Well, if Pat Boone was here, I would suck his cock if that was a shame.  Oh, that would probably win, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well.  All right.  Loser.  Get off the stage.  Good!  All right.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  So far, Pat Boone CD only can, so you have to beat a Pat Boone CD. 
[02:04:30]  That's going to be tough, I think.  Danny, what do we got next?  Well, next up, let me get, so that's like the kind of, you know, that's one of the ones  that's not the greatest things.  We'll put it on that list.  Oh, shit.  Now we'll put some stuff on the more interesting list.  Wow.  All right.  Let's get a good one.  Yeah, but we're not going to start out with the best.  But let's get Joe up here.  Joe.  Oh, jeez.  My handwriting stinks.  Joe.  But you're the only Joe.  All right, Joe.  Joe's working his way up.  Another guy with the, what I like to call the comb-over of the new millennium. 
[02:05:00]  Boy, the second someone starts losing that hair, they just shave that shit right off,  don't they?  Steve Wilkos.  Yeah, that's me.  All right, Joe.  Where are you from?  I'm from Oak Lawn, Illinois.  Hey, when you walk into, when you open the kitchen drawer, do all the forks just stick  to your hand?  You're going to.  Sometimes a spoon, it, all right.  Joe, what do you got, buddy?  No?  Matrix?  Genuine kangaroo scrotum. 
[02:05:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What makes it genuine?  It's just, exactly.  It's just.  In the original wrapper.  It looks like it's just a balloon, though.  Now, that looks like a whoopee cushion, but it is leathery.  With a keychain.  It's a keychain.  All right, you know what?  We got a contest.  That's weird.  That's odd.  Is that a real?  Wow.  Father of a murdered son.  Husband of a murdered wife.  See Roman war helmet now?  Fuck you all.  Fuck you all. 
[02:06:00]  Are you not entertained?  Wow, that looks very red.  Boy, those kangaroos must get their balls scrunched along.  It's pretty fucked up.  Even with the band-aids on his balls, it's pretty fucked up there.  Yeah, it's pretty fucked up on it.  All right, you know what?  It's a novelty item.  It was for sale.  You didn't rip it off yourself off a kangaroo.  I wish I did.  You punch him in his face and tear his ball back off.  Kill the fucking dingo.  It's in your mouth.  How about this?  It beats the Pat Boone CD. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, very good.  You are right.  So you saved us.  You're in first place.  All right.  Kangaroo's photo.  Who would have known that piece of shit trinket is a home run in this audience?  So now, seeing as we have a separation between the two lists,  what list would we like to continue with?  Do you want to go back to the Pat Boone shit,  or do you want to move on from the kangaroo scrotum?  We should alternate.  Yeah.  I think alternate.  Yeah, yeah.  You just say a name, and we'll go.  I was like, okay.  I brought my shoes and my glasses, so I'll have them.  This is how spontaneous me coming out here is. 
[02:07:00]  I didn't know we were having a contest.  I would have brought something.  What do you have that might be odd?  Well, when I was in the back and I heard we were doing a contest,  the first thing that came to mind, and I don't know,  I might be able to find something more strange in my house,  but I own a human skull.  A real human skull?  Yes.  And where did that come from?  I can't tell you.  Oh, shit.  Illegal.  Oh, shit.  Illegal.  Adam Walsh!  Oh, shit.  Oh, what the...  Wow.  I was just quoting Sam. 
[02:07:30]  Why?  I was just quoting Sam.  Why would you bring it up?  What happened?  Well, we had to film CM for what happened.  We were interviewing him with John Walsh.  Why would you bring it up?  I was interviewing John Walsh.  It's not even in context to what we were talking about.  Why would you?  Listen to me, Sam.  I'm going to tell you at SummerSlam.  Sam, we were interviewing John Walsh, Sam and I,  and when he walked in, Sam didn't mean to,  but he went, Adam Walsh!  He yelled Adam Walsh to John Walsh,  and John goes, my name is John,  and I'm like, hi, John. 
[02:08:00]  Welcome, John.  Oh, Jimmy was fucking flustered.  Hi, John.  Welcome, John.  We love you, John, not Adam.  Do you have to use the John?  I've been a John.  Anything to come...  And he didn't do it on purpose.  He just did it because he's an incompetent.  And Sam is getting little...  Sam is getting little titties, by the way.  I hope everybody notices.  Sam is getting little titties.  That happens after marriage.  It happens after marriage.  It's like, oh, my wife,  she made a wonderful meal today.  It was like...  Sam, can you take a bump today from CM Punk? 
[02:08:30]  I guess.  Oh, shit!  Yeah?  Are you on hormone replacement therapy?  And by bump, we mean a snort a Coke.  No?  No.  Any Coke heads?  Hey.  Shit.  That's not...  Who's next?  Chicago don't know how to party.  Danny, what do you got next?  Well, how about Uriah?  Let's have Uriah come up here.  Uriah Heep.  Where are you?  Oh!  Remember them?  Can we get Uriah?  Here's Uriah.  How about you know them?  Jimmy said he's laughing. 
[02:09:00]  No, you're spelling that wrong.  I hope it's not just a backpack.  Uriah, where are you from?  It's a bomb!  St. Charles, Illinois.  St. Charles, Illinois.  It sure was.  It sure is.  I don't know how to speak Wookiee book.  Oh, shit.  Can I see it?  Oh.  Let me see.  You know, if you would have told us that in Klingon...  Sam, can I see that?  Wait, oh.  Wait, how old is he?  How old? 
[02:09:30]  That's good.  How to speak Shekla.  Jimmy's room is next to mine.  I heard that last night.  See, because he was...  How old is this?  Well, that's not going to beat the...  This is a new book, right?  No, that does not quite...  Beat the kangaroo scrotum.  So far, the Wookiee book is not good.  The kangaroo scrotum is in first.  This is an easy contest to win.  If you've got something weird, you can drive down if you live close.  No more bullshit. 
[02:10:00]  So wait, everybody's a fan of the show, and you listened to the episode that was in Philly,  and you knew somebody showed up with, what, a frozen...  A freeze-dried monkey.  A freeze-dried monkey.  And you bring a Pat Moon CD and a Wookiee book.  Thank you.  What are you guys doing?  Chicago.  Fucking represent.  You know what?  You're right.  Somebody go find a monkey right now.  Go ahead.  All right, Danny said...  I have my belt.  All right, let's get to something better than that.  Yeah, Danny said enough with the bullshit.  Let's go, Danny.  Yeah, really.  All right, let's get Jeff K.  Jeff K.  All right. 
[02:10:30]  How about Jeff...  Jeff K.  I know, it's hard to think of lettuce, isn't it?  Here's Jeff.  Lettuce and carrots.  How you doing?  Hi, Jeff K.  Where are you from?  Chicago.  Hi, Jeff K.  How you doing?  Wow.  What do you got, Jeff?  He's wearing the Nike Switch, so with just do it, you mean eating.  Big guy.  I'm in the, I look like, E-Rock competition later.  Uh-huh.  Oh, E-Rock, because he's fat.  Wait, give me E-Rock a shot for once.  E-Rock, you all right with that? 
[02:11:00]  I couldn't even hear what he said.  Oh, because it's fat in your ears.  Yeah.  Ah-ha-ha-ha.  Because he's called you fat.  That's not cool.  Jeff, what do you do for a living?  I'm a headhunter.  You're a headhunter, which means you get people...  Well, so am I, but that's more for, you know...  Ah.  I'm a man of leisure.  I miss stupid Steve.  All right, so you're a headhunter, which means you get people jobs.  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  And he brought something.  What do we got, Sam?  Sam, how about you show us first?  Yeah, yes, he's selfish. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, well, it's framed, so it's not going to stay in my shop for long.  What the fuck is this?  I'll give you $10 for it.  No.  I won a $2,000.  He gave me $10.  I feel pretty good.  I'm going to get a gumball.  Now, it says chemical prophylactic kit.  Oh!  And there's a bunch of...  That's a very old piece of paper with some...  It looked like stains on it.  What exactly is this that we're looking at?  It's a prophylactic kit from World War II.  World War II.  Wow.  So this is so the guys...  And now, how did this work, sir? 
[02:12:00]  Please.  You've got to read the instructions.  No, I don't.  Can I see it?  Yeah.  Let's read the instructions.  I'll be very careful with it.  It's a lot of shit in a frame, to be honest with you.  This was my grandson's sake, Jimmy.  A prophylactic kit from World War II.  Let's go.  Hold on.  That's not bad.  Let's see.  It says...  Who cares if you're fucking without a prophylactic?  You're going home.  And the dough, boys.  It says immediate treatment kit for prevention only, not a cure.  Oh.  Directions used immediately after contact, which I guess means after you finish your load. 
[02:12:30]  But, A, pass your water.  Water.  B, wet a small soaped cloth, which is one of these items, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  And make a lather by squeezing in the hand.  Boy, they're really giving out the fucking...  How stupid were people in 1943?  They don't know how to make a lather.  No, anything.  And wash all your private parts thoroughly for several minutes.  I love that movie. 
[02:13:00]  Rinse your cloth and squeeze it out.  Then wipe your private parts dry.  CM, you want to do letter C?  I'm picturing all this happening in a foxhole, by the way.  Squeeze into your urine canal the entire contents of the metal tube.  Ow!  Ow!  Aw, shit.  Ow!  Massage jelly well back into the canal and retain for at least five minutes.  Oh, my God.  And there is a little thing in there.  Watch an episode of Amos and Andy while you do it. 
[02:13:30]  There is a little tube with a little cap on it, which was probably squeezed into some poor fucker from Long Island's dick back in 1943.  Get your wife to suck it out before you punch her in the eye.  Massage the contents of the white tube for at least three minutes over...  Of course it's the white tube.  ...over the entire length of the penis and adjacent abdomen and thighs, paying particular attention to the foreskin, the head, and the neck of the penis.  The neck of the penis.  That sounds disastrous.  Yeah.  I'm just squeezing my dick.  Exactly. 
[02:14:00]  I don't know why.  The instructions should say, get hooker, squirt this into her mouth.  And then the final E says, wrap the tissue sheet around your penis and cover with cloth bag to protect your clothing.  Avoid passing your water for at least four hours.  And you can see the thing that got wrapped around the head and sheath of the penis.  It looks like one of those old tabacky pouches.  Yeah, it's a very, it's a very, it's a very, it's a very small Ku Klux Klan hood.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  Your racist penis.  Yeah.  It's the, go ahead, Danny.  Show that.  That's a fucking.  That's pretty fucking cool.  That, so far, is a very fucking cool item.  What the fuck?  You're looking at a pawn in a cell.  Wow, hey.  That's pretty good.  That's going around to the.  I bet your pawn stars would buy that.  I wonder what that felt like.  What was in the tube that squirted into your cock fucking vein?  No clue.  That's got to be cool.  It says it in there.  I just, I just skipped that.  That looks fucking painful.  What do you guys think of that?  That's pretty good.  Pretty good, right?  I like that one.  That's not bad.  I think he's in the lead.  Prophylactic kit. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, that's fun.  All right, thank you.  I'm going to have an expert come in and see if it's a genuine prophylactic kit.  I know a guy.  Yeah.  All right, let's have Hector come up.  Hector.  Hector.  He'll be next.  Hector.  With his oddest thing.  All right, a green card.  Oh, because his name's Hector.  Get it?  Ah, you're fucking illegal.  Oh, no, you look pretty American.  What's up, Hector?  Yeah.  What did you got in the bag?  Bubble wrap. 
[02:15:30]  That's crazy.  It's fun to squeeze.  Oh, it's something.  That means he's protecting this.  Oh, we got a skull.  What is it?  A dog.  A dog skull?  Oh, God.  Oh, that's impressive.  That's kind of cool, though.  That's good.  Was it your pet?  No.  How did you find it?  My buddy gave it to me.  He was from New Mexico.  The desert.  Oh, God.  What?  Liar.  Why are you calling him a liar?  Liar.  Why is he a liar, sir? 
[02:16:00]  I've been informed we have a late entry, and it makes perfect sense to bring him up right  now.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Hold back for a second when your dog's stall.  Let's get the late entry in.  It's in a cooler.  It's in a cooler.  Oh, good.  Raleigh Fingers has something for us.  All right.  This guy's a problem.  He's got a cooler.  He's opening it up on stage.  What's his name?  Sam, do you miss your dad looking at his mustache?  I have my dog's skull, and it's complete.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Shit.  My parents had this dog from before I was born. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  It died under the shed.  You killed it, obviously.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I removed the skull myself.  What?  That's a big and lunatic.  What kind of dog was it?  What kind of dog?  It was a Rottweiler mix.  That's a big, fucking solid skull.  I see your skull and raise you a jawbone.  I want to ask Jeffrey Dahmer, why did you remove the skull yourself?  I'm a creepy fuck.  I don't know.  Just to remember him by.  Now, let me tell you something.  Did you had to cut his head off? 
[02:17:00]  No.  How did you remove the flesh and skin from his...  Since it was under the shed, it was missing for, like, two weeks.  And when I found him, it was already decomposing, so I used...  You just thought it was Jimmy's ass that he was smelling?  So I used some...  See, his farts are terrible.  I just used some kitchen knives and...  Oh, no.  Pried it out myself.  Like I did that hooker back in 1998.  The dog died and had a pair of his mom's pants and peanut butter on his mouth.  Just kidding, sir.  No, you're not.  What was the name of the dog? 
[02:17:30]  Rally.  Oh.  Living the life of Riley.  It means you're under a shed.  Poor little guy.  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Oh, man.  They want him to fuck.  Oh, my God.  Wait, he's got...  The medulla hole?  The medulla hole?  Sir, he's got a hole.  All right, sir, you can't...  Sir, you can't do that.  You can't fuck your...  That's okay, right?  No, you can't pull out your penis.  We can tell him all you want.  You can...  I'll just shove it in your pants. 
[02:18:00]  He's fucking...  It's pretty small.  ...the back of his dog's skull.  It's a grower, not a shower.  But you're putting your...  Like the dog.  He's putting his dick in his old dog's...  Wow.  ...skull?  That's fucking brutal.  Don't fuck your dog head, sir.  I can't take that.  I haven't seen one breast all day.  I want to see breasts before somebody fucks a...  Except for that fat guy.  Thank you, sir.  If you're going to fuck your dog skull, I want to hear a Sarah McLachlan song while you do it.  So I can contribute money to that cunt. 
[02:18:30]  All right, that's pretty good, though.  That beats the other skull guy, so you can beat it.  Wow, yeah.  Both good entries, but that...  You can beat it.  Pick the bricks walking.  That's right, but this guy that has a skull in his actual family dog, that's pretty cool.  It's fucked up, but it's...  Is there a second place prize, or are we just going first place?  I don't think we even have a first or second yet.  I think it's between a prophylactic guy and a guy that sucks his dick.  But he's saying, is there a better prize?  Well, hold on.  Let's ask the crowd.  What's better?  This guy's a family pet?  Dead skull? 
[02:19:00]  World War II prophylactic?  I love prophylactic.  Sorry, bro.  Wow.  But that was good.  Real good.  You know what, though?  I will say that's a good choice, because the dog skull is really cool, but the prophylactic  thing is rarer.  Like, you know what I mean?  Although, if you put your dog skull on your dick, you probably won't get a disease.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Thank you.  Good night.  By the way, Spaz is in the audience for the old-timers.  Where's that?  Giant mosquito. 
[02:19:30]  New York hat there.  Oh, kind of, yeah.  There you go.  You look like a guy that used to work with us.  Whatever.  All right.  What do we got next, Danny?  Well, next, let's try Jackie W. She's got something kind of morbid.  Jackie?  Yeah, Jackie.  What?  Jackie!  Just hop on up here.  It's my hysterectomy in a bucket.  Wasn't the last thing morbid, though?  Oh, shit.  This might be a little more.  Okay.  Show your dick!  Oh, how you doing?  Hi, how are you? 
[02:20:00]  Hello, sweetheart.  Very good.  Were you a gymnast?  Sorry.  No, you're very good.  You have a nice, you're very sexy, uh, sexy.  So are you.  So are you.  Do you think so?  Thank you.  What is that?  F.H. Riley's.  What do you got there?  Huntington's.  Joyce DeWitt?  Yeah.  That's funny.  No.  Of course it is.  9-11.  My husband was working down on the pit.  Oh, this will be funny.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Everyone just say shit.  What the fuck?  Is this going to make us very sad, miss? 
[02:20:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a dead woman's shoe that got blown up.  What?  The trade center.  No, no, no.  No.  Why would you keep that?  I don't know.  It is odd.  You can't pull her.  I'm not touching that.  You can't pull her.  That's it.  Look, we said oddest thing.  That's pretty odd.  That is.  It's real.  Hey, that's a relic from a national earth.  No, it's an artifact.  You can feel where her toes were.  Let me see.  Let me see.  You can feel where her toes were. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, wow.  Wait.  Holy shit.  I'm not shitting you.  I'm getting a report that we have Mohammed Atta's jockstrap, which trumps that one.  Dude, that's fucked up.  You got to look at it.  I'm not going to touch it.  I don't want to touch it.  It's creepy.  And it's got like World Trade Center goop in it.  Oh, man.  There's a big cut on top.  I bet she got hurt on her foot.  I remember that smell, unfortunately.  I'm going to donate it to the museum.  Oh, really?  That's nice.  Yeah.  That's great. 
[02:21:30]  Museum of tasteless, tacky people.  No, the World Trade Center Museum down there.  Oh, that's a very good idea.  That's probably a good idea.  Oh, that's very nice.  Hey, look.  It is a weird artifact.  It really is.  It really is.  It's Jimmy.  I think the World War II, because I have something from the Trade Center to my house.  I think that, wait, wait.  Let me ask you, though.  Why did you, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Why did you decide to keep that?  And how did you get it?  Yeah, how did you get it?  How did you get it?  That's the thing.  My husband was...  A woman hopping around going, ow, ow, ow. 
[02:22:00]  It's illegal.  I shouldn't have that.  Why not?  Because there's cocaine in it.  He was working down the pit and the cameras, and we weren't supposed to take anything.  And I found it poking up through the dirt and the rubble.  Did you think you were saving someone at first?  Hey, I found a...  Not so much, no.  Oh, wow.  No, but I knew it was an artifact.  I'm a history teacher.  I knew it was an artifact.  Artifacts have to be a little older, I think.  Yeah, I think in like a hundred years, if they dig around and find a shoe, they'll  be like, ah, we found a shoe.  I probably wouldn't have kept that, but...  Hell of a role model. 
[02:22:30]  If you could still smell the foot fungus, it's not an artifact.  But do you really...  Graved digger!  You're a graved...  Graved digger!  You can't buy that.  No, of course you can't.  You can't buy that.  I love the rationale.  You can't buy that.  You can't.  Yeah.  She makes a point.  You can't buy that.  You can't make this shit up.  You're not going to find that at sex.  All right.  Well, thank you for bringing it, but I still say that the World War II prophylactic is  in the lead.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's see.  All right.  No, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Uh, uh, no way. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, she wants a shot, at least.  What are you guys thinking?  Does this be...  You can buy those prophylactics.  Oh, she's yelling.  She's yelling at the crowd.  Oh, man.  Where's a Muslim terrorist when you need one?  You can buy those prophylactics on eBay.  You cannot buy this.  And I am not lying.  It might be something on Craigslist.  It also proves karma is bullshit.  You want to show your tits?  Well, you know what?  No.  I do think she has, even though emotionally people don't like it because it's a very sad 
[02:23:30]  thing, she has the weirdest thing.  I think so, too.  She absolutely does.  We said odd thing.  We didn't say odd thing because it doesn't make anyone uncomfortable.  It is a one-of-a-kind.  That is, if she's telling the truth, that's...  Hold on.  Let's ask CM Punk.  CM Punk, the only sober person in the joint.  What do you think?  I agree.  I agree.  I think that's stranger than a World War II prophylactic kit.  She convinced me.  She said you can buy that on eBay. 
[02:24:00]  And the fact that she took it herself is pretty amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rave robber.  All right.  What's any luck we have?  Well, let's get Justin F. up here and take a look at what he has for us.  All right.  Let's see what Justin has.  Honest thing you own here, live in Chicago.  Where's Justin?  Justin F.  Please make your way to the stage.  He's working his way up to the stage.  Please welcome your next dancer, Justin F.  All right.  Here comes Justin. 
[02:24:30]  He's coming from the right.  We didn't see that.  All right.  Oh, he's got a backpack.  Oh, it's a fucking bomb.  Yeah.  I don't like these backpacks.  Oh, God.  This is horrifying.  I don't like these backpacks.  What's with those shorts?  Yeah.  Why don't you come up with them all?  Yeah.  He's going to Bushwood after this.  He's opening his back.  What's your name, sir?  What's your name?  My name's Justin.  Oh, Justin F.  Okay.  I've got two pieces of the Berlin Wall.  One from the eastern side and one from the western side. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, they don't like that.  Hold on now.  I'm sorry?  Why don't people like...  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with the Berlin Wall?  Well, I think because I've seen this on Pawn Stars before.  And when they brought in the Berlin Wall, they said that if you have a big slab with artwork  on it, it's their collector's item.  But there's so many chunks available from a huge wall that...  Oh, oh, sir, sir, you got to...  Allow me to return.  This piece right here is from the western side. 
[02:25:30]  It does have graffiti on it.  And this piece right here...  This piece right here is from the eastern side.  Oh, let him fight!  East side, west side, bitches!  He has official documentation as well.  Can I see it?  Can I see that?  Which one?  This wall piece.  Can I...  Can I...  That's pretty...  That's a piece of a fucking cinder block.  Nice.  Can I say something, though?  When I was working in Buffalo doing radio, we gave these out as prizes.  Did ya?  Yeah, pieces of the Berlin Wall.  Pretty interesting.  It was very easy to get back in the day.  It was a wall that stretched pretty fucking far. 
[02:26:00]  Hey, you want to impress me?  Bring the whole fucking wall.  There you go.  There you go.  That's a guy who's hard to impress.  Oh, what do you have?  I also have my father's business partner over in Germany.  You'll fuck.  Oh, Greg makes shit videos.  He was on the western side, and he went to the eastern side, got himself a wife.  His wife's father was a KGB agent.  Ah, KGB agent.  And got my father a...  You got him original magnetic trays and genuine leaning napkins! 
[02:26:30]  Oh, my God!  What is that, Sam?  I don't know.  What is it?  You got a book?  No one cares.  Oh, it's a metal.  Is that a passport?  Yeah, it's a passport.  It's a passport.  It looks like David Hasselhoff's passport.  Yeah, your papers.  That's my dad.  That's your dad?  That's my dad, yeah.  Oh, it's your dad's passport?  Is that an anti-Semitism medal?  No, it's KGB.  They weren't exactly anti-Semitism.  Can I see that?  Now, that is that, and that's a communist medal as well. 
[02:27:00]  Can I keep this?  Can I see that?  Was it given to Obama?  I would never give a single thing to Obama.  Shut up, you liberals.  Wow, okay.  Can I see that?  Who's the guy?  It's pretty cool.  Can I see that?  Oh, no.  I don't like him.  Oh, no.  No, don't.  Oh, shit.  Oh, I didn't even think of that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  Oh, my God.  No, I'm not watching. 
[02:27:30]  I can't look.  Don't do it.  Please don't.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  That's my dad's fucking thing.  You're going to do it, do it.  Oh, no, don't.  No, it's his dad's thing.  No.  Come on, dad.  No.  Please.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Can I have it back, Opie?  Oh, he wants it back.  He's asking for it back.  Don't do it.  Opie, I'm going to ask you.  Oh, he's putting it down the stairs.  I've been shut down?  Really? 
[02:28:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I'm a goddamn father now.  Take your fucking thing.  Let me grab it from you, Opie,  and I'll give it back to a faggot.  What the fuck?  Give me another son.  It was the right thing to do.  You piece of shit.  It was the right thing.  Fucking angry ant sucks.  I know.  You could just say ant.  All right.  That was very good.  All right.  That was a good one.  I still say that the woman has the best or the oddest thing. 
[02:28:30]  It is the oddest thing.  I got to agree.  Again, you guys will ultimately vote, but I'm...  Yeah.  What's that?  Hold on.  Captain Willard from Apocalypse Now would like to say something.  Come up out of the water and tell us.  You called the young lady a woman.  Yes.  What's the difference?  Holy shit.  What?  She shouldn't be called the victim.  Young lady.  Oh, I see.  Oh, there you go.  I file trade with that guy.  But what is she trying to say?  All the items have been very educational so far. 
[02:29:00]  I feel like, yeah.  Except for the dog skulls.  Yeah, the dog skulls.  But even that had a story.  All right.  Let's move on to the next one.  Let's go get into school.  Somebody spice this up.  Exactly.  There's basically one good thing left.  Oh, okay.  And then there's a whole bunch of shit stuff.  So do you want to go back to shit stuff?  More shit stuff.  I said we do a quick break.  Yeah, I got to piss.  I got to pee.  And then we'll finish the oddest thing you own, I think.  Is that fair?  That is very fair.  Are you staying?  Yeah.  CM Punk.  You're staying?  I'm staying for CM Punk.  See him at Comic Con tomorrow. 
[02:29:30]  That's so fucking cool.  He stopped by today.  And are you guys having a good time today with us in Chicago?  Thank you for coming down, man.  You guys are a great crowd.  We have a little more while to go.  Stick around.  We'll be back in five minutes.  Yeah, fuck you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is live from Chicago.  More O&A in moments.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues. 
[02:30:00]  Live from Chicago.  All right.  Chicago, how you guys doing?  Good?  These fucking guys are hanging in there, huh?  What a pisser this was.  Jesus Christ.  That piss was awesome.  Yeah, it really was.  That was a good one.  Well, Jimmy, tickling your balls probably made it that much better.  You know?  That wasn't tickling.  The word is licking.  Tee-hee.  All right.  We're in the middle of the oddest thing you own here in Chicago. 
[02:30:30]  Who doesn't?  Well.  Oh, the girls.  And CM Punk, obviously, really.  Thank you so much.  We love CM Punk.  Absolutely.  These aren't working.  What do they do?  By the way, we're having a contest after a woman who has the thickest vagina.  Thick?  Largest.  Wins $300 and some semen on her shoe.  Why is this fucking towel here? 
[02:31:00]  Like Jake LaMotta?  Get rid of this fucking thing.  Where's Danny?  I'm here.  All right.  Danny?  Oh, there he is.  Danny.  Now, Danny, so far, for anyone listening out there, let's refresh what we have so far.  Refresh.  You're among friends, Danny.  From the cool things that we've seen here, we have a kangaroo scrotum.  Yes.  That was good.  We have the prophylactic kit from World War II.  Yes.  We also have the 9-11 shoe.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  We also have pieces of the Berlin Wall as well. 
[02:31:30]  Now, also, we have a very interesting angle from a couple of our cop friends in the back  about the 9-11 shoe.  Okay.  And these are guys that were there.  That were actually on the ground right after it happened.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're saying, not verifiable.  They're a little suspect.  Oh, shit.  They're a little suspect.  Oh, shit.  She picked it up herself.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  We believe you.  I believe you took it out of the ground. 
[02:32:00]  Yes.  But the thing is, it could have been blown out.  It might not have been on someone's foot at that moment.  It could have been a bum's shoe that they lost earlier.  It could have been in a file cabinet.  Yeah.  It could have just been in the garbage or something.  It could have been.  But the location where it was, it was down in the level.  Oh, man.  Will you let Leatherface talk, please?  Go ahead.  These people are from Chicago.  They weren't there.  Hey, wait a second.  Hey.  You know, they evacuated all the big buildings in Chicago, too. 
[02:32:30]  Even though no one gave a shit.  Yeah.  And don't call it Chicago.  Sound like you're from here.  I call it Chi-Town.  Go into the Willis Tower in Chi-Town.  We went down there.  We had to walk down there because there was no mass transportation.  So we had to walk down there from Penn Station.  And so it was Saturday.  What are the pencils facing?  It's Saturday.  Fucking home run, Colmia.  Take us out.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Jesus.  We're lying. 
[02:33:00]  No, no, no.  We didn't do that.  What the fuck?  What happened to Lisa Orban?  Oh, yes.  Four people got that.  It was that Saturday, and it was right underneath.  No one gives a more.  Hold on.  Let Nick Marsch finish.  All right.  Nine-Eleven.  The who gives a fuck story is on the history.  That's not flattering at all.  That's not a word.  Well, we were there, and I was playing Looks to Kill.  All right.  Go ahead.  What happened?  Ursa from Superman 2. 
[02:33:30]  Go ahead, sweetheart.  You can feel her toes in it.  So, I mean, so it wasn't from a shoe store.  It was fat.  No, she hung.  Ursa!  Ursa!  She is so fucking pissed off.  Hold on.  I am so fucking pissed off.  You're mad at us.  I love you.  Oh, thank you.  I love you.  You have a big vagina.  You're mad at these people for disrespecting your ghost shoe, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Disrespecting that lady shit.  Yeah, you're disrespecting the lady. 
[02:34:00]  Don't try to make it sound like you're paying homage to her.  Oh, shit.  She's yelling at someone.  Oh, shit.  Hold on, Sam.  Mike.  Mike, what's happening?  God, disinfect.  What's up, Bill?  Why are you so pissed?  He's nasty and he's nice.  Who's nasty?  Show us the nasty guy.  Which one?  The guy with the...  Oh!  Which one of our audience members is nasty?  We're going to have him removed.  Fucking empty room.  You fucking fast forward.  What can I tell you?  What can I tell you?  Mine is the only article that you cannot buy. 
[02:34:30]  Artifact.  But what about his glasses?  You can't buy it on eBay.  I don't think you can buy it.  It's going to the museum.  Is it?  Museum?  Does the museum want it?  It's a 9-11 museum.  It's the museum of who gives a shit?  O.P. Trump!  O.P. Trump!  Danny, let's go.  Let's move on with the contest.  O.P. Trump!  O.P. Trump!  Hold on a second, guys.  I don't know if this is the wrong time.  But I just wanted to say... 
[02:35:00]  You got a boner?  That I feel really good...  I just wanted to ruin the flow of the show.  Well done.  There's nothing better than just disappointing everybody at once.  It's like I just fucked you all.  By the way, I'm tweeting Dead Shoe, if anyone gives a fuck.  Who's next?  You can make your own decision.  Danny, what's up?  Dan?  Odyssey going here live in Chicago.  Let's go with...  If we're going to end with a good item, we want to go with the... 
[02:35:30]  We're feeding back something.  Yeah, Dan, please.  It's you.  It's you.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  Let's have Keith M. come to the stage.  That's your...  Oh.  Keith M.  Keith M.  Oh.  I traveled with Keith M.  Not that one.  That one.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  He's making his way to the stage.  Wait, again?  The same guy?  Very...  What did he do?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Hey.  Hey, wait.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Nice.  Nice trip, buddy. 
[02:36:00]  Have a nice summer.  Have a nice winter.  That didn't work.  What happened?  Not you.  What happened, Danny?  I know.  I must have both done.  Did you really think we wanted to see your dog skull again?  What did you think?  We were reconsidering?  I made a mistake.  Fucking beat it with your morbid lunch.  Wait, did he say a dog skull?  Get him back up here.  Oh, that sounds fascinating.  Throw a stick and have him run off stage.  It's E-Rock.  Huh?  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  Yeah, come on up.  Oh, let's see.  Oh, that's not E-Rock. 
[02:36:30]  Shit.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  You're a fat fuck.  Strangest thing you own.  Your body.  Wow.  It's not a treadmill.  All right.  Oh, my God.  What's your name, sir?  What?  Microphone.  Ben.  Okay, Ben.  Don't worry, Kenny.  I don't think he's going to thrust it into our chest.  No.  He might take it to Morton's and order with it.  That's a mistake.  Okay.  You think he can afford Morton's?  Come on.  Oh, man.  It's a... 
[02:37:00]  Dude, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got to like...  What's your name?  Ben.  Ben.  Okay, Ben.  What do you do?  As a kid, Ben Dover?  I manage a pawn shop.  Do you really?  Oh, you do.  Now, Ben...  What is it?  A food pawn shop?  No.  Oh, see, because...  I say sold.  Sold.  Now, you're a big guy, Ben.  Now, that's obviously very inconvenient for you, right?  It's hard for you?  Do you try to...  Do you try to...  I have.  It's hard, right?  Yeah.  How much do you weigh, Ben?  How much do you weigh?  Be honest.  Three digits. 
[02:37:30]  Three digits?  Is the first one a nine?  I'm kidding, Ben.  Why?  But aren't you worried about your health?  Yeah.  I step on the scale.  I weigh error.  I weigh...  See, because the scale...  Been there.  Can I ask you a question?  Do you think what you have beats the World War II Propholactic Kit?  Well, it's from the same time period.  Okay, but do you think...  Are you confident that it beats...  I feel like it could.  Because I want to know why, that if you think maybe yours is going to come up short, 
[02:38:00]  why you would subject yourself to coming up on this stage and being under the scrutiny  of these inebriated gentlemen who are clearly going to pick you apart, I got a quick idea.  Just a quick idea.  Can Sam try on your shirt?  I'll give you a hundred bucks.  What the fuck?  Wow.  I'll give you a hundred dollars.  I don't want to lose him.  What?  We would lose him.  Oh.  Can Sam try on your shirt?  I'll give you a hundred dollars. 
[02:38:30]  He'd be embarrassed.  You don't want to take your shirt off.  It would be one of those...  What's that?  I'm sure.  All right, Sam, take off your hoodie.  Here's another photo op for everybody.  I hope he's at a hundred bucks.  Oh, shit.  He's got two.  Yeah, good boy.  Oh, he's got two shirts.  He's got two.  Fuck.  He fucking wins.  This kid wins.  I was hoping to see him without a shirt on.  He's got another shirt on.  Oh, what a fucking genius this kid is.  Fuck, here's a hundred.  Take your headphones off, stupid. 
[02:39:00]  That's his swimsuit.  He's going swimming after this.  All right, Sam is trying on a giant red shirt.  And Opie's pulling out the worst hundred bucks he ever spent.  Oh, God.  It's the worst bet ever.  Is that XL, XXL, or Buick?  Same because the car is big.  Holy shit.  All right, Sam, turn around to the crowd.  They all want to take your picture.  They all want to put on a Chris DeBerg song.  Lady and Renaissance.  It looks like a cake.  Jimmy, give him the hundred.  It does.  Yes.  It's super douche.  Here you are, Ben. 
[02:39:30]  A hundred bucks from fucking Gregorio.  And if you knew it, that shouldn't be the honest thing you own.  A hundred bucks from Opie.  That's good.  That'll buy you appetizers.  Hey, don't laugh too long.  See, because...  All right.  And it's just a mean motherfucking thing.  No, I'm not, you cunt.  He's brutal today.  All right, so what do you got there, Ben?  Besides a hundred dollars for me.  What do you got for it, Ben?  It's an authentic Nazi dress bayonet. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, Jesus.  If you not see it, then how are you supposed to look at it?  It's not a hundred dollars.  Like a German.  Yeah, what is it?  Invisible?  All right, that's a...  Daniel, let me take a look.  After you're done, sir.  If it's authentic, wouldn't there be a Swazi on it somewhere?  What do you think?  Yeah.  It's authentic.  I've done a lot of research.  Oh, have you?  What research have you done?  Let me take a look.  I am an expert.  It knows.  In not only the materials, but the ideology. 
[02:40:30]  It's actually one that would have been carried by a fireman.  A fireman in Nazi Germany?  A Nazi fireman.  That's good.  Let it burn.  Yeah, really.  What do they do?  Let's take a look, see?  You know what?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm pretty sure to have a Swazi on it.  Even from a distance.  Just Google it, Punk.  Google it.  Google it.  I'm going to Google this knife.  Punk, can I take a look, see?  Let me see.  A look, not see?  Could you take it out?  Yeah, absolutely.  If CM Punk had trouble taking it out, I have no fucking chance. 
[02:41:00]  Thanks.  Thanks.  Oh.  That's pretty cool, though.  Jimmy, please thrust it into your chest.  Sparisol.  Yeah, why don't you thrust it into my chest?  It's just made in Taiwan.  I don't know if it's...  No.  What do you think?  Let me see.  Hold on.  It looks too new.  I'm not really into the plastic.  The rivets seem a little off.  And the blade, it's too...  Made in Israel.  That's no good.  You're wrong. 
[02:41:30]  Is this the part where he would say, ah, I know a Nazi guy.  I'm going to call him and he's going to come in and take a look at it.  It's in too good condition for the porting.  It's in very good condition.  What research did you do?  How did you get it?  I started typing in whatever it says on the blade, and you just kind of go from there.  I do this for a living.  While you were cutting a steak?  He's Chicago's Chumley.  I prefer serrated.  Why don't you round him up, chum?  What you got there, son?  I am saying fucking false. 
[02:42:00]  It's a plastic handle where back then they were made out of more natural materials,  bone and whatnot, because plastic wasn't really readily available in the World War II era.  You would think, no.  I'm not fucking buying it, sir.  Not buying it.  Oh.  Get out of my pawn shop.  Wow.  Hold on.  CM is looking up something.  I mean, it's German, but...  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  What, are you ordering a pizza?  Hey, you guys want to hear a good joke? 
[02:42:30]  Terrible.  That was a great visual joke.  You guys want to hear...  I asked the knife.  He's on his phone.  That was a good joke.  The knife said his name is Mac.  No one would get it.  What?  Oh, that's good.  He's Googling it.  He's not giving up.  He wants to Google the knife.  All right.  You can Google.  As you're Googling, Danny, what else we got?  Is that it?  Well, I had originally asked for Keith M, and a different Keith had come up.  But if Keith M...  Keith M.  M.  If you don't have a dog skull, and your name is Keith.  M as in mutant.  And if we don't have Keith M, it doesn't look like we do. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, he's coming around somewhere.  Now he's gone, huh?  Maybe he got kicked out, too drunk.  All right.  Well, then let's have Taylor M.  Taylor M.  Could you please bring your item to the stage?  Taylor M. working his way up.  Oh, good.  That looks like Travis.  Oh.  It was Travis.  There he comes.  Hello, Taylor M.  Well, he's got another framed item.  Jesus Christ.  It's Jesus Christ.  It's actually Jesus Christ. 
[02:43:30]  Very good.  The only way this wins is if it's a self-portrait.  It's an actual photo.  It was signed by Pontius Pilate.  I hate this guy.  Wow.  That is a portrait of Jesus.  What makes it special?  This was the Jesus painting that Larry David peed on.  In the Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Let's put a yamaka on it.  But is it the actual one?  It is.  It was stage used. 
[02:44:00]  Wait.  How did you get that?  So this guy was a friend of a friend, and he's the props manager for Curb Your Enthusiasm.  And I emailed with him, and I said, I need something cool from this show.  He said, the only thing I can think about is the Jesus painting.  So I paid him about $1,200 for it.  Oh, wow.  And he sent you one of 15 Jesus paintings that they had.  Do you have a COA on that?  What's that?  Well, I had him do this on the back. 
[02:44:30]  What did you say on the back?  Oh, it's written in hand.  This is the picture.  Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Picture was used during Filmy of Curb Season 8.  Limited edition.  Jesus Christ, that was pissed off.  And Jesus Christ.  That's, uh, well.  It is on official Curb Your Enthusiasm letterhead.  Oh, it is?  All right, well.  You know, I really don't doubt you, because it's possible.  I mean, you could have gotten it.  But I can't verify it, so I can't put it in my shop. 
[02:45:00]  I mean, it's about as authentic as...  You know what?  CM just wrote.  CM Punk just wrote.  Picture was...  Sir, please.  Oh.  I heard you.  It's a radio show, sir.  Yeah, exactly.  CM Punk wrote, picture was not used in Curb Season 8.  What he's basically saying is as verifiable as the awful handwritten sign.  That is true.  I think the value goes up if he signs that and I put it on the actual...  Jesus. 
[02:45:30]  You know what?  You're right.  He is right.  I don't know.  What do you guys think?  Oh, wow.  That's hurting.  Hey, we're going to talk about what's real and what isn't.  If he had something with a gold seal on it, all of a sudden now it's real?  Yes.  Yeah, I know.  You're right.  You're right.  All right, so what is it?  So, I mean, look.  All it takes, if you really want to get into it, we could actually call the production.  I mean, all the numbers are on there.  We could make a call, a phone call.  Call him and say.  It's probably his friend, though.  Oh, yeah, it's real.  I swear.  I'm on the Larry David set right now. 
[02:46:00]  Larry, stop.  Sam's got the actual still from the episode.  It looks just like it.  It's probably the same painting, but I mean...  Not to say it couldn't have been one of 30 that they made.  Yeah, exactly.  Like the Kramer.  All right, well...  You know, the Kramer painting.  A lot of people wound up putting that in their fucking house for like a month.  It's not anything I'm going to sell.  I just want it for my own use.  Look, we're not going to buy it.  Exactly.  No one's offering you $1,500.  No, I know it's real because he doesn't give a fuck if you care if it's real.  Right.  He doesn't.  No, I know it.  And I kind of like that.  I think it is real.  You can care less if you think it's real. 
[02:46:30]  I think it's real.  Well, he believes it's real.  But it's not a matter of not thinking...  I know that you believe it.  A lot of people believe Jesus is real, too.  Oh, the religious people are going funny.  Oh, we just got religious nuts on this shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  CM Punk.  So why don't we do this?  Why don't we get the three finalists and we'll have the audience decide.  Was that the last of it?  The last person?  That's the last of it.  That's it.  All right.  That's it.  We had some good stuff here in Chicago.  Oh, yeah.  We're still looking to beat the dead monkey in a bag thing. 
[02:47:00]  Well, you know what?  That was fucked.  Huh?  That got fucked.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot that.  All that means is that the challenge still remains.  I like that.  I like that part of it.  I don't mind that.  All right.  So where are the three finalists?  We'll have the crowd.  Well, the three finalists are going to be...  I got to go with the dead shoe.  Prophylactic.  Got to go there.  And one of the dog skulls?  Ah.  Danny?  It's fine.  I thought the Larry David painting was going to go over a little harder.  Why don't we bring up...  People call bullshit.  Wait a minute.  Why don't we bring up all four and let people vote? 
[02:47:30]  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  They don't call me the solution kid for nothing.  Oh!  I thought that was the oddest thing you own.  Somebody brought up a retard.  All right.  All right.  We're going to bring up the finalists.  Yeah.  And we're talking about the dog skull that was the guy's actual dog.  Oh, yeah.  That was the winning skull.  Family pet.  Yeah.  Keith M. 
[02:48:00]  Okay.  All right.  Come up.  Come up.  Come up.  Where is everybody?  Move.  Move.  Now.  Let's go.  Come on.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Bring him up.  What the fuck?  Yeah, man.  Got ditched.  Oh, boy.  He almost fell.  All right.  Remember that guy?  Prophylactic, doghead man, fucking Frankenstein, and fucking this guy.  Fucking Mark Messier.  Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  Oh, man.  This is great.  It's fucking...  We've taken show and tell and put it to a radio show. 
[02:48:30]  Yes.  Very macabre show and tell.  A bunch of idiots.  Yes.  Macabery.  I like it.  All right.  Let's vote.  Do you want to go over their head, Sam, or...  Yes.  This is Mr. Prophylactic.  Oh, prophylactic.  Sam doesn't know how to do this.  No.  No.  Everyone knows that would probably be the winner.  No.  No.  He might be right in this one.  What an idiot.  I know.  Last, right?  This is Dog Skull.  See?  See?  This is fake painting. 
[02:49:00]  This is Angry Bitch.  Wow.  Well, the boo is louder than the yay.  What do we do?  Yeah, on a noise-o-meter, she would win.  A noise-o-meter.  Very good child of the 80s.  Look at those two and then have the other two goals.  Okay.  Wait.  Oh, big solution, Kenny.  All right.  Whatever.  Process of Elimination.  Top two?  They're out of here.  Say hi.  Oh, shit. 
[02:49:30]  Did they even cheer for her?  Oh, 9-11.  No.  On the noise-o-meter.  Wait a second.  Sam, you think...  He got more noise than her?  No, but she got more booze than him.  No, I think she got more booze.  You don't know how to do this.  Oh, are you doing that?  So we're going noise-o-meter?  You think Dog Skull is more interesting than phony?  No, I think he got less booze.  Now you can't throw him off.  Now you've got to do all three again.  Yeah, let's do all three.  You know what you should have done?  You should have said that was a dog skull from 9-11.  That's what you should have done.  Oh, shit.  The poor puppy was up.  Is it too late to change it? 
[02:50:00]  Windows on the world, eating some fucking steak.  All right.  You're not knowing New York, motherfuckers.  Who are we starting with?  Her.  Yes.  We're going to end strong, Sam.  From the noise-o-meter.  Trust me on this one.  Who wants the shoe?  Dead lady's shoe from 9-11.  Ground zero.  Nothing.  All right.  We got it.  The dog skull.  It was his family pet, though.  I know.  Fuck him.  Fuck!  And the prophylactic kids. 
[02:50:30]  Squirting fucking fluid up your dickhole.  Wait a minute.  I think you got it.  From World War II.  Sam, you got to mic the lady.  She's not happy.  Oh, shit.  She's writing.  What are you writing?  She's writing a podcast.  She says here, Jim, I'd love to eat your ass.  Oh, jeez.  That's my note for real here.  Jim, put it down.  Oh, hold on a minute.  We have a little lawyer here.  She says the paperwork says you guys decide.  Oh, shit.  I read a disclaimer.  So agreeable.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Go hang out with management. 
[02:51:00]  It's a silly disclaimer.  I will say this, though.  We just got a basis of information off the audience.  Now we will decide.  Yes.  Take a fucking walk, you bitch.  Anthony, is he in third place?  Third place?  Let's hear it for third place.  Dead girl shoe or whatever.  Fucking ground zero.  Well, we wanted to hear the audience's vote before we voted. 
[02:51:30]  Yes.  Stupid lawyer.  All right.  Come on.  I vote for him.  I vote for this guy, too.  Yes.  Fair.  It's got to be prophylactic guy.  Now we voted.  How the fucking looley.  What do you guys think?  How much did he win?  How much did he win, Sam?  Tell him his prize.  He just won $1,000.  $1,000.  $1,000.  Holy shit.  Buy us all drinks, you cheap motherfuckers.  From IHateStevenSinger.com.  Thank you, Steven Singer.  For $1,000.  It's a great place.  The other side of Walnut Street in Philly, if you happen to be there. 
[02:52:00]  How the fuck does that guy come up with this kind of money?  I think it's Sam Roberts money.  Right there.  I do know that he's a drug dealer.  All right.  We all know that.  Everyone knows that.  And we are going to be signing after the show, right?  We're going to stick around and sign.  Not anything.  We're just going to talk with our hands.  See, that's...  Oh, fuck.  What a bomb.  Wow.  Well, you know what?  It's time to wrap up.  It sure is.  First of all, I want to thank Chicago for having us. 
[02:52:30]  This fucking lot.  I want to thank Steven Singer Jewelers.  Visit IHateStevenSinger.com.  Also, keep cheering.  115 Bourbon Street for having us.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Thank you to our friend CM Punk for coming down.  Of course.  CM Punk.  All the wonderful contestants that participated in our dumb fucking games.  What about Puke Guy?  Where's the Vomit Guy? 
[02:53:00]  Thank the Vomit Guy.  Take your bow, sir.  E-Rock for being a good sport again.  E-Rock who judged the Bad Breath Contest.  Of course, the lovely and talented Sam Roberts.  Who warmed up the crowd.  That's the only reason we're here.  Of course.  We're here for Sam.  We all love him.  Of course it is.  Makes sense to me.  I ran first.  Somewhere Bob's going, that's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Wow.  What a cool crowd.  Wait, we were supposed to end on a big cheer, not a fucking lull. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  And then we've got to go.  Thanks, everyone for coming down.  Chicago.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  See you guys on the radio in Boston.  Well, that sucked.  Thanks for listening to ONA Live from Chicago.  Listen for replays throughout the weekend.  Here on the O.P. Anthony Channel.  What is going on? 
[02:54:00]  This is the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  O.P. and Anthony, worst of show.  My name is E-Rock.  How are you?  They are not here, so I am here and digging through a lot of our hard drive of hits, as  Dennis Falcone calls it.  You can hear him on the 60s channel.  I don't know where or when.  You'll have to Google him.  I'm sure it's somewhere.  Anyway, worst of O.P. and Anthony, looking through some old stuff here.  And here's another bit where nothing really serious is going on.  We just go back into reflecting into our lives and see what we did growing up and making 
[02:54:30]  us the horrible human beings that you would listen to us today.  The horrible human beings that you listen to every morning.  This one's about crying in childhood.  And did we do a lot of crying in childhood?  Well, we know Anthony did.  Jimmy, I have no clue.  And O.P., I think, is made of stone.  So sit back and relax as we explore crying in our childhoods here on the O.P. and Anthony  Show.  This is the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. 
[02:55:00]  I realized my mother was still worrying about me well into my 30s.  I'm not even shitting you.  I'm, like, thinking, like, all right, when can you kind of, you know, back off and be  like, all right, you know, I don't have to worry about my kids anymore.  No.  Like, she was still worried, like, if I was...  I don't think that stops, though.  You know, like, my dad's still, like, when we'll, like, you know, drive to Montreal to  see my wife's family.  He'll be like, all right, well, you know, text me when you get there.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think that goes away, though. 
[02:55:30]  Well, that's kind of like any loved one worry, so I understand that part of it, but I mean  the parent-child worry thing, yeah.  Like, it starts with the cord around the fucking neck and shit like that, and it just continues.  You're gonna bash your head on something sharp, you're gonna drink some poison, you're gonna  get kidnapped.  It's just a fucking worrisome, horrible thing.  You just don't want to care about anyone.  No, bingo.  I don't want to care that much about anything, not even anyone, anything in my life. 
[02:56:00]  You were always actively worried about you into your 30s?  Yeah, like, worried if I was gonna just even have a roof over my head, and, you know, God,  was I a fucker.  Slipping you $20 bills, like, just save this.  What are you doing?  Use it for gas.  She probably should have been worried, though, the fact that you were fucking power drinking  at noon and driving an air conditioning van fucking 90 back to work to fucking put a toilet  on someone's ceiling.  Fucking, of course she was worried.  I worry about you now, I'm your radio partner. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess I gave reason to worry over the years, but, um...  Was she worried about Joe, too, and Dawn?  No, Joe's more of an independent guy.  Dawn, of course.  She's like, my baby.  Dawn, the girl.  But I was just that fucking oversensitive crybaby kid, so she had to worry about me.  I was like, oh, she's probably looking at me during my entire youth, just going, oh,  he's gonna be just a disaster.  Just a weepy faggot. 
[02:57:00]  She'd call you into, like, your 30s asking if anybody, like, was mean to you today?  Was anyone mean?  I'd be like, oh, Mom, I cried at work today.  I would announce that I cried at school.  Like, I'd get home and be like, hear you, hear you, I cried at school today.  Because it wasn't enough attention that you got at school when you were crying.  You needed some more.  Somebody was a blogger before it was him.  Yes.  It would have had an emotional live journal if he'd gone to school later. 
[02:57:30]  I was emo before emo.  You're the Britney, leave Britney alone.  Yes.  Yeah.  So what happened?  You cried at school?  Why?  I don't know.  There was always something, you know, my feelings got hurt.  They picked on you?  They picked on me.  I've told this story about the cookies I brought in that my mom bought, and they said it looked  like dog shit, and I started crying because I felt bad that the cookies were, and my mom  bought them. 
[02:58:00]  You had duty cookies.  You didn't even make them?  She bought them?  She bought them.  Who cares?  I know, but.  You're making fun of the manufacturer.  Look, Sam, why don't you just.  Nobody wants duty cookies made fun of.  Duty cookie kumia.  Duty cookie.  Kaka kumia.  I cried at work today.  Travis, yeah, I know.  He made fun of duty cookies.  I was fucking, I was the little fez.  Yes, it was very, very harrowing. 
[02:58:30]  What a harrowing youth I had.  So you'd just go home and just say, I cried today?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I'd go home, and I'd, I actually would wait until it was pried out of me, like, like,  mom would be like, you know, oh, how was school today?  Oh, wow.  Oh, let me tell you.  A little weeping going on.  A little crybaby Anthony.  Uh, had to cry.  Why?  Oh, shit cookies.  Because of your crap cookies that you bought and put me in a bad spot. 
[02:59:00]  And then I cried because, like, like, Valentine's Day, the girl I wanted to get a valentine from  didn't give me one.  Aw, what was her name?  Ah, fucking cunt.  But she would, like, like, because I would always get these, these, uh, fantasies built  up in my head.  I would go to school, and the girl I was totally in love with would give me the big valentine,  and we'd talk and hold hands and all that shit.  And, of course, she gives it to the popular guy, guy, you know? 
[02:59:30]  And I'm, like, left there.  Because you had built up the whole scenario in your head.  Oh, did I build it up?  And now that it wasn't happening, it's like, well, this whole thing is falling apart.  And it felt so good in your head.  Yeah.  Did you give her a valentine?  No.  Why would I do anything like that and actually be proactive in my life?  You just hope we should give you one?  Right, right.  Who, the fucking kid with the fur coat and the giant cock?  And the weepy eyes?  Yeah.  Fucking pissy eyes and leaky dick. 
[03:00:00]  The creative kid with the dolls back there and the voices.  It was a puppet.  Yeah.  Was it a doll?  It was a puppet.  That's who the girl's going to want.  I don't want the football player.  I want the kid doing the Carol O'Connor impression.  The fucking...  Playing with the doll without strings.  The puppet without strings.  A peat.  Yeah.  So you fantasized that she'd bring it to you.  Yeah, yeah, that she would bring it to me.  And I used to, like, just fantasize about, like, romance as a kid. 
[03:00:30]  What a fucking fruit.  You really did lock away everything in your childhood at one point.  At some point.  The door shut.  Yeah.  The vault fucking handle spun.  And that fucking combination was lost.  Yeah.  Never to open again.  No.  Did you just cry in the classroom?  Yeah, sometimes.  Openly just crying in the classroom.  Sometimes.  Sometimes I would.  What a loser.  In front of the teacher.  Yeah.  Who I then would want to, you know, give me sympathy. 
[03:01:00]  Of course.  Did the teacher ever stop class to ask why you were crying?  I think, did you have to make it about you?  I'm trying to think.  I did have to make it about me.  I was, yeah, I was craving detention.  Did you explain to the teacher that this was how you got loved at home when there was Friday  and you would cry and that's when the hugs came?  Why would I explain something?  I had no clue really what it meant.  I thought maybe you analyzed that with her.  I never analyzed anything.  I just, it just happened.  Like, yeah, parents fighting, of course. 
[03:01:30]  I'm going to just, I have a stomach ache.  We had a crying kid in class and the teacher hated him.  Oh, jeez.  She hated how you would just cry at me.  Yeah, definitely.  No, I think they liked me.  Because he would sit there crying because he couldn't figure out the math.  Because he was sick the day before.  Yeah.  And then he'd come in and we'd learn a new lesson.  And she gave him the work from the day before, but he didn't know the lesson.  So he would just stare at the page and he'd start crying.  And then the teacher would kick him out of the classroom and make him go into the empty 
[03:02:00]  room next door to do his work because he was disturbing the class.  He was a distraction.  Yeah.  And while we were all learning, we just heard from next door.  Oh, yuck.  So he wasn't like a quiet sober.  No, he was bawling.  I hate him already.  He couldn't figure out his math work.  He was really like a yelly cry.  He was sobbing, crying.  I was a yelly cry-y guy.  I was trying to, you know, work out the sniffling.  The sniffling.  Because it was like, it was really forcing. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Forcing it out to, you know, get some kind of attention.  You were like Caligula making this speech when Tiberius died.  You had to put onion by your eye.  Yes.  Two onion bags.  To get a little tears coming.  Whether it was an onion or just smelled like onions.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It's just.  Oh, poor weepy Anthony.  It is very embarrassing.  You were crying on purpose.  I must have been.  Like, at the time, I never put two and two together like that.  But where is the Valentine's boy? 
[03:03:00]  You're right.  Not only the crier, but the Valentine's, the romantic, the sweet duty cookie boy.  Where is that?  I would just imagine, like, holding hands to me was, like, the big thing.  Yeah.  That was a big fucking deal as a little kid.  I'm not talking fucking, you know, 15.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm holding hands.  This is great.  But I'm talking, you know, when you're, you know what, like, seven, eight, nine.  At that age, hand-holding is the equivalent of cream pie cleaning as an adult. 
[03:03:30]  It's very important, that holding hand thing.  And, you know, there's very few circumstances that I actually got to hold a girl's hand.  There was a fire drill.  Because you're crying all the time.  Yeah, exactly.  I was crying.  I was wiping my tears away.  So, I was crying a lot.  No, fire drills, you used to have to hold the girl's hand and walk out and double file kind of a thing.  And then there was square dancing, which we had in gym class. 
[03:04:00]  Like, I grew up in fucking Oklahoma.  I was on Long Island.  I had square dancing, too.  What?  Did you?  Yeah.  You were in Jersey?  No, Florida.  Oh.  You and Eric?  Did you see you?  Oh, yeah.  Take the boat to the square dancing.  Eric, you're square dancing and cracking the hardwood floor.  Yeah, you see him riding his boat with a fucking corncob pipe and a fucking square dancer's hat.  Pretty cool, huh?  Yeah, pretty cool. 
[03:04:30]  Swing up hot in a round and round.  I never understood why we were joking.  Get down.  Promenade your dinner.  I wish I knew more square dancing.  I know, right?  Trying to figure out how to fit steak martini into a rhyme.  Yeah.  Shit.  It was very cool because you got to touch a fucking girl in school.  It was great. 
[03:05:00]  You do that thing where swing your partner wasn't that good.  Elbows.  Lock arms and fucking do that.  But there was that thing where you held.  She put her hand behind her back.  You grabbed that hand.  And then she put her hand in front of her.  And you grabbed that hand.  So you're like, and I think that was Promenade or something.  And you were like touching her hand.  Your hand was on her belly.  It was on the small of her back.  You were fucking.  That was fucking.  Did you like that?  Yes.  And I just like. 
[03:05:30]  And then I thought about the girls I liked.  And what that would be like with the girl I liked.  And just holding hands.  Like I would.  I would imagine like long walks holding hands as a kid.  I mean as an eight year old.  I'm imagining things that people do on fucking Christian Mingle.  What a douche.  No you weren't.  You were just fucking Michael Corleone.  In fucking Sicily.  Courting a young lady.  Yes.  Young other friends of mine with dart guns. 
[03:06:00]  Little suction cup dart guns protecting us.  From a vendetta.  Yeah.  She gets on her big wheel.  She was going to drive the big wheel up to me.  Yes.  Yes.  But somebody put a firecracker in the wheel.  A Tuesday, Sunday, Monday.  Cry baby, cry baby on Wednesday, Friday.  A little fruit.  She like hold her hand.  Like if you get the girl that you liked.  Would you hold your hand with hers for just like a second longer?  Or try to make eye contact while you're holding hands? 
[03:06:30]  I would say this is more than just a dance.  Yes.  I would always try to make it more than it was.  I was under the impression it was.  She, not so much.  No.  Yeah, there was a girl that I really liked.  It was the cousin of the girl who lived across the street from me.  And she went to a whole other school and everything.  I maybe saw once a month.  And apparently, like I thought we were going out.  What a dork.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:07:00]  She was very cute.  Did she think you were going out?  No.  We would go, you know, what kids do, you go to the stores, you know, you walk around  the stores and go fucking, didn't have any money to buy anything or go anywhere.  So you just walked around the town and stuff.  And I thought because we were walking around that we were going out.  When did you find out that you weren't?  Um, I guess when the girl across the street, um, told me that, uh, she, you know, wasn't 
[03:07:30]  coming anymore.  I'm not going to walk.  I'm not going to walk to the store with you anymore.  Yeah, I thought she, you know, and I'm like, well, why would she do not, you know, if,  if she called right now and I had a way, I would get to where she is.  Right.  Because we're going out.  But then meanwhile, you know, she wouldn't drop everything to come and see me.  You're like, this has got to be reciprocal.  This is a two-way street, honey.  Love is a two-way street.  Yeah.  I wasn't getting that back from her.  Right.  So, uh.  No more walks to the store. 
[03:08:00]  No more walks to the store.  No more, no more throwing stuff at Crazy John, the guy that used to push the shopping cart  full of junk around behind the stores.  And you'd throw things at him?  Always just something romantic, like heaving, heaving rocks at crazy, at retarded gentlemen.  Heaving rocks at mentally disturbed older people.  That's what you did with the girl?  Yeah, we would throw things at him, but then we would talk to him also.  Like, hey, Crazy John, what do you got in your basket?  Today.  Right.  I got plastic bags. 
[03:08:30]  He used to love plastic bags.  Why?  We would talk about that.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, it was kind of, it was one of those situations where I would always blow things up in my head.  Just looking at Rich.  Speaking of retarded people.  Yes.  Let's throw rocks at Rich.  Do you like his backwards hat?  When did the innocents die?  Oh, that's good.  When did I finally get a dose of reality? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Like, when was it like, this isn't working?  Let me go through the years.  10, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14.  You think so?  Around the virginity, losing.  Yeah.  You realize it's not so special at all.  Yeah, but I would still get completely head over heels infatuated with girls.  Just sit up at the table, uncomfortable.  Head up there, Rich, you dumb mother.  Don't be so shy.  We're talking about, you know.  Childhood girlfriends.  Childhood girlfriends, early. 
[03:09:30]  Like, how you felt and what a faggot I was.  I was always crying in school.  I had a girl break up.  How old were you?  I called this girl.  You know, I go, hey, how you doing?  And she goes, I don't want to go out with you anymore.  And I go, I thought it was her sister.  I go, put Kathy on the phone.  She goes, no, this is Kathy.  And she, like, I was fighting her breaking up with me.  That always works.  When you have to talk a girl into continuing going out, you know it's going to be a real nice relationship.  I've had, everyone was the worst. 
[03:10:00]  Where I caught the first girl I ever fell in love with banging my best friend.  That was the worst.  Oh, oh, yeah.  I had one of those.  Not a caught, but broke up with me and then went out with my best friend.  And, like, I just imagined them fucking.  And it was just a heart-wrenching.  I climbed up on a roof and saw them through the window.  Why were you up on the roof?  Well, here's the deal.  That's the name of a movie, actually.  It was called A Cuckold is Born. 
[03:10:30]  I mean, I got a thousand of these fucking stories leading up to probably last week.  You know, she'd pick me up from work every day.  And then all of a sudden, she'd...  You're talking a little older here.  How old were you?  I was 21.  No, we're talking about seven or eight years old.  I'm talking, like, seven, eight years old.  When you liked a girl, she doesn't like you back.  When you liked a girl, and it was like, you know, for me, holding hands was like sex, you know, back then.  Yeah, but you're still dating those girls.  You asshole.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What happened when you were 13? 
[03:11:00]  We're trying to figure...  Because Anthony was this loving, creative kid, always crying at school.  Yeah.  And now he's...  Who wouldn't cry after their father raped him in the shower?  He never raped me in the shower.  He'd walk home early every day and go, guess who's dirty, Dad?  So what happened?  I guess, yeah, the losing virginity thing was pretty important as far as making that separation  between just this hopeless, crybaby, romantical kid and, you know, the bitter gentleman I've become over the years. 
[03:11:30]  But...  Because it wasn't a special thing, and you knew Buzz didn't love you.  No?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  No, I know that.  It wasn't a special thing.  But I didn't want a special thing.  Like, I don't regret that it was that, not some big fucking whirlwind love fucking romance movie thing.  I like the fact that it was just some fucking whore that I got to fucking get it out of my system. 
[03:12:00]  How old were you when you got laid?  About 13.  No.  Yeah, she was 19.  His father hooked up.  His father thought he was just gay.  It's like, let me get that crybaby's dick in a woman.  And look at he split.  And what did your father do to you, too?  You want to report with another boy?  He didn't have to.  I said, Dad, why are you throwing me under here?  I'll show you the faster way to get to this.  You got laid when you were 13?  Yeah, yeah.  You could even get a heart on that young?  I guess. 
[03:12:30]  Sure.  Sure.  You know, I remember when me and my friend, we were literally, this is back in Edison,  so I was probably first grade, second grade.  We would suck each other's penises.  And he got an erection.  And I didn't, no, he's getting hard.  I didn't know, my mind wouldn't get hard at that age.  I didn't know, I was wondering why his did that.  I didn't understand what an erection was.  Wow.  Me and somebody, we'd do that.  We'd touch each other, but, like, try to put it in, but nothing would happen, because  it couldn't get hard, because we were too young. 
[03:13:00]  You tried to put it in where?  In his sock drawer.  You fucking idiot.  No, I would like to wear it, too.  In his little hiney?  Yeah.  He would rub it, and then he wanted me to sleep with him, but he wetted the bed, so I  wouldn't.  And so did you, you drooled on the pillow, and he pissed on the bed.  He wetted the bed.  You actually said that worse now than you would have back in.  I liked a girl in kindergarten, and I wrote her a note. 
[03:13:30]  I'd go, you look very pretty today.  And she was so disgusted, I caught her eating pussy right after it.  What?  No.  You're a fucking idiot.  That's hilarious.  How do you get laid when you're 13?  That's fucking, you're like a black kid.  No, it was, yeah, my father kind of hooked it up.  I think, I think, like, my father probably knew I was just cranking it, like, in the bathroom 
[03:14:00]  every fucking night, in the bedroom, like, jerking off like a goddamn maniac.  He's probably like, oh, God, this kid's got to fucking get laid.  So there was a girl, Buzz.  Yeah, I've told the story a thousand times.  A girl, Buzz, just used to hang around.  She's 19.  And she was recruited.  She was recruited.  Big fucking tits.  Yeah.  Yeah, there were only white girls in San Juan Capistrano back in the 80s.  You never fooled around with a black chick or a Spanish chick? 
[03:14:30]  Let me think.  Blowjob, nothing?  No, I'm all white.  I used to fuck this black chick.  She was so hot.  And I would, I'd come so quick, I didn't, and I would apologize, and she'd go, it doesn't  matter, it's not big enough anyhow.  Oh, she would say that?  Pretty much.  Wow.  I mean, she already, it was fucking, big fucking gapping pussy.  Oh, man.  You know, there was nothing you could do to that unless you were fucking, you know, Patrick  Ewing or something.  Yeah.  You know, and she was so hot, man.  I'm just not attracted to black chicks. 
[03:15:00]  It's just not, I've seen a couple over the years that I have deemed attractive for a  black chick.  Lucky them.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Um, but I just, I'm just, you know, it doesn't, doesn't do anything for me.  Sam almost looks like a black chick.  Sam would only date black chicks.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  His wife is like his first white fucking girl.  And she's a very white young lady.  Oh my God.  She's a very white girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  When I was, uh, from when I was in high school, but I was always in relationships, but yeah,  yeah.  I used to only really date black girls.  In high school?  Mm-hmm.  And you didn't get tormented?  No.  Did you go to a white high school or a black high school?  No.  It was, it was probably like 40% white and then a lot of black and Hispanic kids.  Oh boy.  That would be 60%.  Did you get, did you get beat up?  No.  You fit in very well.  Yeah.  I kind of, you know, I was able to go from crowd to crowd. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were like the liaison.  Yes.  That's right.  Yeah.  I brought the communities together.  You did.  The rainbow coalition.  You're a regular fucking peacemaker.  Look at that.  And then you started dating their women.  How did they feel about that?  Well, I didn't really date like, uh, the super ghetto black chicks.  No?  Yeah.  Suburbanized black chicks?  Yeah, most of the black girls would hang out with white people anyway.  The ones that they expect, the ones that black guys would expect to date a white guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you're so just, no one knows what you are, so it's kind of like, oh man, fuck it,  I don't, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. 
[03:16:30]  What the fuck is that, motherfucker?  You'd only show up with like your hair, um, nobody would see your face and they'd go, that's  one of us.  Yeah.  I had hair like that in school, big afro and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you?  Oh, fuck yeah.  It was just a big, horrible afro.  Just terrible.  Well, look at, guys that like great fucking hair.  The hair that, that like, all they could, all they had to do was take their fingers and  run it backwards through their hair and flip their head back and it was fine.  I couldn't even get my hand like an inch through my hair.  Like nappy-headed motherfucker I was. 
[03:17:00]  I had this crybaby nappy head.  I had this big fucking horrible afro and I hated it and everybody, and I went to New  York and got my hair cut in a shag.  Like, you know, the shag, and it was fucking, it looked so fucking good the first day.  Yeah.  And then when I tried to blow dry it myself, it just took off and now my hair was shag  afro.  It was fucking.  Just shag fro.  Oh, God.  You know the shag that like David Cassidy had.  Yeah, that's the hair you wanted.  Yeah.  That's the hair you wanted as a kid like that growing up. 
[03:17:30]  Fuck, you just, ah, just do a dumb big fucking afro.  I used to have so much dandruff when I was a kid.  Oh, no.  I swear to God, I would always sit too close to the TV.  Like, probably, we had this wooden coffee table and I would rest my right arm on it  and sit on the floor.  And like, it was probably from me to Anthony, like, maybe two feet away from the TV.  And I actually wore out the top of the table, and there's times when I would have dandruff,  and I would just put my head over the fucking wood table, and I would just scratch my head 
[03:18:00]  and literally cake it with fucking flaked dandruff.  I had so much dandruff.  Snow globe head.  That was a big thing for me, was that somebody in school would say if I had dandruff, I would  be so embarrassed.  What kid has dandruff?  What an old man thing to have as a kid.  I know.  Oh, God.  And you could cure with a dollar shampoo. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I had so much dandruff.  They'd have found out it was just dried cum from the janitor.  Dude, I was a...  I paid flakes.  Fuck it.  I was a...  I would feel it.  Like, you scratch your head, you could feel like...  It feels almost like waxy when you have so much dandruff.  Oh, God damn.  It was terrible.  Who has that much dandruff?  I was very dirty.  Were you a dirty kid?  Yes, I was.  Were you a dirty boy?  Yes, I was.  How often would you shower when you were a kid?  I hated showering.  They had to make me do it.  Oh, I bet. 
[03:19:00]  Gross.  I wanted to drink.  Did you stink?  I don't think I ever stunk.  No.  Listen, if you had that much dandruff, believe you me, your underarms weren't fucking...  My hair was always greasy.  I knew that.  I told you when I was in high school, Lynn, who I thought was really beautiful, I was like  a fucking sophomore, and we sat next to each other.  Oh, no, this was...  I was sitting in front of her, and I had a crush on this girl who sat behind me, and Lynn  was in front of me, and she was going, why don't you wash your hair? 
[03:19:30]  Oh.  And I said...  I was just ignoring it like I didn't hear it.  And she goes, why don't you wash your hair?  And I said, it is washed.  And I kicked her chair.  I was in high school.  You were lying.  It is washed.  It was...  It is washed.  Even in high school, you weren't washing yourself?  No.  Oh, wow.  So Ann was crying, and you were just the kid who smelled like dirty hair all the time? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, my hair stunk.  See what makes great radio people?  Fucking just outcasts.  I would go days in high school without washing my hair.  What?  I would go days in high school without washing my hair.  It was really long.  You know what, though?  That was the look when you were growing up.  That's true.  It was very grungy.  Greasy, grungy, fucking long hair.  I was also told one time by a girl that I should really brush my teeth.  Oh.  Oh.  I guess I hadn't, like, brushed my teeth in a day or two.  Once only I should remove mine.  Fucking rotten teeth. 
[03:20:30]  Horrible.  Wow.  What did you say when she said that to you?  I said, okay.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  What an awful comeback that is.  It was always the hot girls in our school.  It was the girl at the bagel store.  In our school, there were some really, really fucking hot girls.  Yeah.  And they all went out with, like, the fucking black football players for a while.  Like, that was, like, the thing.  White chicks?  Yeah.  And, I mean, they were so hot.  Like, now they probably look back and fucking hate themselves. 
[03:21:00]  But, I mean, these girls were so hot.  And you were just even intimidated to talk to them.  Oh, you didn't have a chance anyway.  Not at all.  Not a fucking prayer.  I was a drug dealer in school.  I sold pot and stuff.  So, you got that in.  You should have been able to get some.  No.  You just got the skank girls.  I got that.  What are you kidding me?  What a fucking joint.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One came to my house one day who liked me.  And she knocked on my door.  Like, I never went to school.  I showed up every now and then. 
[03:21:30]  And she came to my door with a heart and my name on her.  What, drawn on her jeans?  On her jeans.  And I looked.  And I just slammed the door and went upstairs.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  You know what?  I always thought, too, that I was going to be able to get some of these, like, girls  that I would fantasize about walking hand in hand with.  And then the girls that would end up liking me were just fucking, like, you know, slobs 
[03:22:00]  or fucking, you know, not the popular girls.  I was just as guilty as, you know, shit running downhill.  I'd get shit on, so I would just shit on somebody else.  Like, everybody in school does.  It's called bullying now.  Back then, it was just called growing up.  Yeah.  And there was a girl that liked me.  And she wanted to go out with me.  And it was kind of a vague thing.  But I think I said yes to her.  And then this other girl who wanted to go out with me said, oh, you know, you're going  out with her.  She's telling everybody. 
[03:22:30]  I went, really?  She goes, yeah, you don't want to do that.  Everyone hates her.  And she stinks.  And they're just bad-mouthing her.  And she got me so paranoid that I, that second, I opened up the classroom door that she was  in and said, no, we're not going out.  Like, I didn't want this to continue another second.  In the middle of her class?  Yes.  With people thinking that we were going out.  Oh, you humiliated her.  I did.  She probably thinks about that to this day.  Yes, it's the greatest moment. 
[03:23:00]  That's when things turned for me.  I didn't have the courage to break up with him.  So my friends went and talked him into the radio with me.  We were going out for a shorter time than fucking Kirk's father was captain of the Kelvin.  It's a Star Trek joke.  So wait, you yelled out, we're not going out?  Yes.  We fucking yelled, that's it.  I was like, no, we're not going out, and then shut the door.  And that was the last I ever spoke to her. 
[03:23:30]  I remember when I was in high school, they asked me, these kids, one of my divorce settled  the same way, but lawyers said different.  Yelling to the court, we're not going out.  I'm fucking this girl now.  In high school, these kids asked me to hold up a sign.  They said, walk up to that classroom and hold up the sign until there was a big glass window.  So I did.  I didn't even look at the sign.  What, are you insane?  I was just dumb.  Dirty and dumb.  Apparently it was this fucking racist, because this girl was dating an Indian guy, so it 
[03:24:00]  had something with a dot on it and some nasty comment, and I held up to the window.  You're like Bruce Willis in Die Hard 2, was it, or 3, which one, where you had to wear  the fucking I hate niggers sandwich board in Harlem?  Which they actually put that in in post.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they didn't want to offend.  There it is.  He had to wear that.  What do you mean they couldn't put it in during the movie?  That wasn't live.  No, because they didn't want him walking around Harlem like that. 
[03:24:30]  Very disrespectful.  So they put it in post.  What do you mean they dubbed it in?  I mean, he had to do it.  Dubbed it in.  Dubbed it in.  Very good.  Nobody answer him.  Yes, dubbed it in, Rich.  It's magic.  It's magic.  It's magic.  Here's Rich Voss, a filmmaker, not knowing how that's done.  They dubbed it in.  They dubbed it in.  Yeah, whatever they call it, you know.  Yeah, it was the same effect they used to make two Patty Dukes.  They were identical cousins.  Two of a kind.  They look alike.  They don't look alike. 
[03:25:00]  But they're cousins.  Oh, they're two of a kind.  Yes, Jimmy?  What was it?  Oh, I just held up the sign.  It didn't go anywhere.  What was it, though?  Was it like Doddhead?  I don't remember.  It was racist.  That's all I know.  Did you get in trouble?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  I think I got called down.  I was like, yeah, these guys asked me to hold it up.  And they were like, what kind of idiot kid are you?  Yeah, I was a junior.  Oh.  I broke a kid's thermos and got in trouble.  Like a little black kid pointed me out. 
[03:25:30]  And there's been speculation over the years that that started my whirlwind romance with racism.  I saw a thermos.  One of those old thermoses.  You used to have in your little lunchbox out in the playground.  And I wailed it against the tree.  Because of the glass inside.  That was like a nightmare, too.  The thermos with the glass inside.  You were always afraid it was going to break.  And you were going to drink like broken glass.  Or you were convinced that if your thermometer breaks in your mouth and you swallow mercury, you're going to die. 
[03:26:00]  You probably would.  I have no idea.  Or if you take a bath with a toaster.  Well, yeah.  I used to take a bath and keep the radio plugged in right next to the tub.  I'd like you to be doing that right now.  Yeah, so I broke the thermos.  And then I looked around and I noticed that a kid was watching me.  So I'm like, oh, okay, well, whatever.  And I was in class. 
[03:26:30]  I was up at the board.  And I'm like doing some math problem.  And the door opens.  And there's the principal, the woman principal, there with the young little black boy that had seen me.  She brought him around like fucking Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe in Mississippi Burning.  Bringing Lester around to pick out the fucking.  And the kid just stood there.  And the principal, I remember exactly, had her hand on his shoulder. 
[03:27:00]  And he looked around the classroom at who was sitting.  And he looked and didn't see.  But then he caught me at the board.  And I looked over.  And his right hand just came up with a pointing finger and just pointed at me.  And then she patted him on the shoulder and went, okay, okay.  And then walked away.  And said to the teacher, send him to the office.  And I was sent to the office.  What a tattletale.  And I had a, I had a, and they were asking me, why did you do it?  And I had no answer. 
[03:27:30]  Like, oh, because I thought the sound of breaking glass is cool.  It was cool.  And there was a black kid.  Black kid pointed me out.  Father John Amos came home from work all pissed off.  All pissed off for ratting me out.  I just remember, too, no emotion, no nothing, just pointed me out.  Fucking rat.  Whole family of fucking rats.  I was a troubled kid.  They made me take a special class.  I'm sure they did.  Of course they did.  I mean, these were the worst kids in this school.  And we had to go into, like, a guidance class. 
[03:28:00]  And they would just make us fight and wrestle.  Fucking fight club?  Kid fight club?  I'm telling you.  Then they said, well, this isn't working.  Let's put them in a lawnmower repair class.  Right.  Oh, that's where all the best students go.  When they send you to, like, fucking, what do we have?  We have, like, Wilson Tech around where I grew up.  And it was one of the BOCES.  Yeah.  Where it's just a bunch of kids turning wrenches and fucking, yeah.  They sent this to another school.  And you sent a trailer learning how to repair lawnmowers. 
[03:28:30]  And I'm going, you know, and I thought, I'm going to have a career.  You're learning a trade.  I'm learning a trade.  I have a career that's going to keep me with a roof over my head.  Here's the worst thing that's ever happened to me in school in my life.  I was in fifth grade.  And we're in the lunchroom.  And it's mainly black kids where I grew up.  And we're in the lunchroom.  And all of a sudden, we turn.  And the whole place goes silent.  And my mother's standing there.  Right?  Whoa. 
[03:29:00]  So as I walk, my mother's there with a principal.  And as I go out for, as all the kids are walking out of the lunchroom, my mother's smacking  me and beating me in front of the whole school.  Whoa.  That's embarrassing.  Why?  It's fucking, because I was in trouble.  I just fucked up all the time, even from fifth grade and stuff.  And all these kids are walking out.  Well, first they go, that's Rich Foss's mom.  You know, or Rich.  And just beat me in front of the whole class.  I felt like Carrie at the problem.  Did they laugh at you?  Did they laugh? 
[03:29:30]  Of course they laughed.  My mom's beating me in the doorway of the lunchroom.  You didn't want your mom involved with you in any way, shape, or form in high school, especially.  High school, fifth grade.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  No, in the lower grades, I needed my mommy there whenever anything would happen, like  a field trip.  I'd be like, you gotta go.  You gotta be a field trip, mom.  You gotta go.  In kindergarten, the first-  You would cry until she went? 
[03:30:00]  Yes, the first day of kindergarten.  The look on Jim's face.  Oh, he's disgusted.  First day of kindergarten, we pulled up to the elementary school, a little kindergarten  class, and mom drove me up there, and she gets out of the car, walks up to the door,  and I think back now, they must have fucking, there must have been phone calls made, preparations  with the teacher, and that, because no other kid I saw this happening to.  The fucking teacher came out by the front door of the school to take me into the school, as 
[03:30:30]  my mom turned away and went back to the car.  Now, I was under the impression that mommy and me were going to school.  We were going to go in and play with fucking paint and have a blast, and then she was going  to drive me home.  I spent all my time with my mommy before kindergarten.  So she turns around and starts walking away, and I'm just like, and the teacher now has  my hand, and I turn around, and I'm like, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, but we're, oh, wait 
[03:31:00]  a minute.  I, bloody murder, I'm crying, screaming, screaming.  You think she was giving you away?  I didn't know what to think, but I wanted my mommy.  You cried a lot.  I was in fucking, I think they must have thought I was, I was impaled with a fucking rebar through  my head.  I was crying, screaming, and, and my mom had to just continue, she, they must have said, 
[03:31:30]  look, he's going to lose it.  She must have called the school and said, he's going to lose his fucking mind.  He is such a little faggot mama's boy.  He is going to lose his shit when I take him to school.  All right, we dealt with this before, we'll do this, but here's what you got to do.  You got to turn around and walk to that car and drive away, because that's the only way  he's going to be able to do that from your marriage.  So she did that.  Exactly.  And don't come back.  Just continue driving. 
[03:32:00]  Make him wait a half hour before you pick him up.  Leave him alone outside the school, weeping.  From 3 to 3.30.  And I fucking lost my mind in front of that school.  Do you know?  I think I did the thing where every muscle just goes away in your body, and, and I was  spinning around by the hand.  Norton wouldn't know anything about that.  The poor teacher is trying to hold me up by one hand as I just am ready to collapse. 
[03:32:30]  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Oh, God.  Oh, I was terrible.  What the fuck?  When you come in here into the studio, like, you think, oh, be nor, I mean, you think they're  the most fucked up people here, you know, but you really are the most damaged, if you  think about it.  I think, uh, yeah, as far as you've got, I think I got over a lot of things, uh, things  I don't even know what the fuck, uh, they are.  Do you really think you got over them?  Really?  No.  With the guns, and the young kids, and your fucking big house by yourself? 
[03:33:00]  Look, every girl I ever go out with is completely legal, so shut up.  Your statues look older, okay, in your fucking house.  No!  You fucking, oh, legal.  I know, there's nothing wrong with liking younger women.  That's, like, if you, if you, as long as you're not dating, where it's, I, I get that.  I wonder if it's about my virginity being taken away when I was 13 by a 19-year-old.  It's also, like, no one wants to grow up, but some, you know, it's like, when you're  dating chicks that are fucking that much younger, if I'm about with a 20-year-old, like, 
[03:33:30]  a 20-year-old, she doesn't want to get married?  A woman my own fucking age?  No way.  What the fuck do I want to talk to her about?  Hot flashes?  Enough of you fucking old broads.  And I've tried fucking recently just talking to women in their 30s.  Some of them are hot and cool.  Most of them, here's the problem.  They're fucking, they have these expectations because of how they came up in school.  They stink.  You women in your 30s that are fucking single, there's a reason you're single. 
[03:34:00]  Because girls in their 20s will text you photos, and, hey, you want to go out?  Yeah, and they're fun.  And you will go, oh, I don't send pictures like that.  Okay.  Bye.  Because they grew up a certain way.  They're not used to doing it.  They didn't grow up with technology the way someone who's, like, 20 did.  Yeah.  So they, they're so weird with the follows.  So you base your relationship on a girl that can text you fucking naked pictures?  Yes.  I base my interest in her.  Not necessarily naked pictures.  But I find myself, I'm not willing to drive far to pick somebody up when I live in New York. 
[03:34:30]  Like, no, no, of course.  But you can find an older lady in New York.  And no desire.  None.  You know why?  None.  Because that's a power trip over.  Not at all.  It doesn't turn me on.  No, but your power trip is being with somebody younger.  It's not power.  It just doesn't touch me.  Because you're so much smarter.  No.  You're a hundred.  I know why you're saying that.  Like, I get the thought behind that.  Yeah.  But that's really not it.  It's not about wanting to dominate somebody.  It is about somebody who wants marriage as little as I do.  And not that women want to marry me, but their fucking clocks are ticking. 
[03:35:00]  And when women in their 30s, I have tried recently.  I've fucking tried in the last year just to talk and fucking every one was a fucking dead end.  Because they're fucking like, oh, I don't know.  Oh, I like, you know, hey, you want to go out?  Could you come get me?  Because they're used to guys picking them up.  I'm like, you don't even live in New York.  I'm not leaving New York to come get you to bring you back and go fuck yourself.  Oh, boy.  No, it's not about dominating them.  It literally is about not. 
[03:35:30]  But they just, they want things done a certain way.  And it's not how I'm going to do them.  Yeah, but you're, you are really a smart person.  You're really well read.  And you're, you know, I mean, you're a fucking smart guy.  So you're thinking they can, no, I hate saying this.  Look at the source, Jim.  I hate, relax.  Okay.  No, I hate saying this.  But how do you think a 21-  You can write your name?  How do you think a 21-year-old girl is going to keep up with your intelligence or, you know, or interest you without sex?  That's the cop-out line I've heard for so long. 
[03:36:00]  There are plenty of girls that are in their 20s or whatnot that are funny, spontaneous, smart.  No, I'm not kidding.  I'm not talking every fucking girl because a lot of them are fucking airheads and dummies, too.  My daughters can't even fry eggs.  Well, there you go.  Okay, here's the question.  But, but, I'd rather have that and a fun, you know, time and laughing and conversation like that than some fucking woman bitching about some medical problem or fucking her ex-husband or the kid that she has. 
[03:36:30]  But shut up.  I don't live that life.  I don't want to fucking talk about that lifestyle.  Or when they do this shit, when you ask for, like, a picture or whatever, even if it's not totally nude or whatever, and they're like, oh, you got to earn that.  Bye.  Yeah, of course.  Because they're raised thinking that you got to earn it.  And it's like, fuck that.  I don't, I don't like that mentality.  I don't, I don't like it.  Like, it annoys me.  Like, I'm not going to earn it. 
[03:37:00]  Like, I'm not asking you to earn it.  I'm not going to do that.  It's like, I won't do it.  Okay, say you, okay, say you're dating a 20-year-old girl, right?  Uh-huh.  You're walking down the street with a 20-year-old girl.  Sure.  Now, say someone your age, you see, that's gay, walking down the street with a 20-year-old boy.  Does that look normal to you?  I don't, I wouldn't, gay?  Yeah, I mean, an old man like him banging a 20-year-old boy.  I wouldn't give a shit.  Who cares?  It doesn't look weird?  No.  No, it's not like gay.  That's why, that's a sign of success. 
[03:37:30]  Like, that guy must make a lot of money to bang that young twink.  He must be doing very well.  I went out with a young girl before I was married, and it just, you know, she would want me to  take her out to eat and do stuff with her.  You know, what the fuck?  I don't do that kind of stuff.  Yeah, I don't like wild girls that want to go out to clubs and stuff.  That I wouldn't do either.  No, no, that, no fucking way.  But I'm telling you, and I've tried, tried, tried talking to women in their 30s, and every  one, a couple have been really fun and sexy, and just, we didn't, but like, hey, you want 
[03:38:00]  to come hang out?  Well, I don't know, I don't know, and yeah, I will, but I don't know.  Oof.  Okay, I'll give you an example.  Keep wondering why you're single, dummy.  What's her name?  What's her name?  I don't want to say her name.  That used to be a waitress at the cellar's probably way in the late.  She would be great, someone like her.  She's hip.  Yeah.  She's fun.  You know what I mean?  So you're talking about ladies that have divorce and kids.  Of course you don't want to deal with that bullshit, but if you find a 30 or 35 year 
[03:38:30]  old hot, single, that doesn't have any fucking history.  They also make you feel older, too.  Like, as a guy, I don't like feeling 44.  I don't like it.  Well, don't look in the mirror.  I don't, but I don't like feeling 44.  So I don't like someone who's going to remind me of that.  And women who are 35, it's very natural for them to want kids.  It's natural for them to want.  Like Sam, even.  Sam's a young guy.  His fucking wife is hot. 
[03:39:00]  Really beautiful.  And he's talking about, like, would you want to have a kid?  And he's going, yeah.  Even with a beautiful girl like that, I can't comprehend it.  I can't comprehend looking at life like that.  Or Travis talking about having a baby.  Like, it's fucking foreign to me.  He's absolutely right.  Because you get this lifestyle that you like and you have fun.  It's, like I said, spontaneous shit.  Being able to just run off and go somewhere and have fun. 
[03:39:30]  That doesn't fit with the lifestyle of a woman that gets up there in years.  But you're, see, right now you're saying, okay, I don't want to have a kid.  And I'm not saying you have to have kids in life or whatever.  Okay, you're saying, this is the lifestyle I like.  I like, you know, I'm transient.  I fucking travel, this and that.  But do you think you're going to feel the same way at 60?  If I do, I do.  If I don't, I don't know, to be honest with you.  But I'm not going to date somebody.  Adopt a little kid from the Sudan.  Exactly. 
[03:40:00]  I mean, if he's famous enough.  I feel no need to do it.  It's not something that repulses me.  I feel no need to do it.  Maybe I will someday.  But again, I've talked to some women.  It's not like I've avoided them.  And every time it fucking annoys me.  And it's like, you really think you're going to fucking put all these barriers up and I'm  going to work my way through them, dummy?  Stop with your rom-com fucking bullshit.  Yeah, exactly.  Realize the fucking era you're living in. 
[03:40:30]  I know I sound like a jerk, but I don't care.  Okay, but take away the whole scenario of the other fucking broads.  On you, just you.  Not wanting to have kids or do anything.  Do you think that's a little self-centered or narcissistic?  No.  You don't.  No.  You wouldn't want to settle down.  No.  Okay.  No.  Narcissism is putting your needs and focusing only on yourself.  It's not about that.  It's just, I know what I like and what I want.  Knowing what you want and what you like is not narcissistic. 
[03:41:00]  It's what would be narcissistic would be fucking getting involved with somebody and then still  doing what I want to do.  Oh, shit.  That's me.  Yeah.  But I mean, that's what that would be.  It's like knowing that I'm fucking immature in a lot of ways.  I mean, you see my apartment.  Yeah.  It's like the fucking, you know, you walk in, there's pictures of me and Sabbath and  it's a sign thing.  Like, that's what I like.  I had to take all my shit down like that.  That's exactly what I will not do.  And I have no desire to do that.  Like, I like, I miss my ex-girlfriend. 
[03:41:30]  Like, my ex-girlfriend.  She was cool.  She was one of my favorite people.  Yeah.  She was fucking, she was a lot, she was 20 years younger than me.  She's fucking smart.  She was vicious.  An older gal.  Hilarious.  I know.  I was really slumming going for the older lady.  But she was hilarious.  I love fucking her.  But just the fighting got to me.  That's the only reason I'm not with her today is because of our fighting.  But she was much younger than me and she was fucking brutal.  Brutal.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  But I mean, it's fucking, I'm never going to fight.  I'm never going to fight a 35-year-old who's more perceptive than her. 
[03:42:00]  Or who reads people immediately better than her.  How about a young, hot comic girl?  Because I see some of them out there.  Yeah, but you know what?  They're fucking flakes.  I've dated one comedian who was not a flake.  She wasn't a flake at all.  She was brilliant.  Yeah.  But, you know, it was hard.  I was a hard guy to date because she didn't like being associated with all the sex addiction stuff.  And I understood that because that was not her fucking vibe.  And whatever, you know, just my public persona was fucking so harsh. 
[03:42:30]  But all these fucking female comics that I'm friends with, none of them want to fuck me.  And I don't hit on them.  Fucking Annie Lederman's a friend of mine.  Never hit on her.  Amy's a fucking one of my closest friends.  Never hit on it.  It's like I don't have that vibe with comics.  I don't shit where I eat.  But it's not, you know what I mean, dude?  No, I know.  It's like comedian's energy to me.  It's like I'm such a fucking pervert.  It's hard to look at women and enjoy them.  It's like it's always sexual.  And it's like comic energy. 
[03:43:00]  I'm able to hang out with comics.  Yeah.  Like I think you've got to look at Amy and go, I acknowledge that she's really a good looking woman.  Sure.  Right.  But I enjoy her energy a lot.  Like I love her funny energy.  So I can enjoy.  Right.  Yeah.  I can enjoy their energy.  It's nice to have friends who are, who I can look at as people first.  And I can talk to them to do with women.  I'm telling you, like there's one thing as dating a comic.  They get like Bonnie and I were in bed.  Yeah, Bonnie.  We were in bed watching X Factor last week.  And some girl goes, I was bullied.  It's not. 
[03:43:30]  And we just started cracking up.  We're laughing.  Going, you fucking asshole.  You were bullied.  Okay, because it was your fault because there's people in fucking wheelchairs.  Go fuck yourself.  I was bullied.  And we're let, and no two normal people would laugh at this fucking girl.  Yeah, I understand that.  I understand that advantage of hanging out with a girl.  But again, I've only dated one comedian and the other girls I've been with have all been like that.  I won't date someone.  And I know you date fucking.  And I say this is actually kind of psychotic fucking sense of humor chicks. 
[03:44:00]  You have to.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't do it.  Could you date a girl that couldn't laugh at your fucking harsh, awful jokes or enjoy them?  No, no, not at all.  Or being tisked, tisked?  Fuck that.  Oh, God.  Imagine that.  Ugh.  Really?  Oh, they have to be fiery racists.  They have to really appreciate a good, horrid racist joke.  Yeah.  That's the criteria right there.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:44:30]  Sirius XM.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that smell?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On Sirius XM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  And this particular bit that we're going to play here is titled Rich Voss Quiz.  Now, I should have listened to this, but I didn't.  But I assume, because it is a Rich Voss bit, that it was going to be gold.  Now, this could be the time when we quiz Rich about celebrities. 
[03:45:00]  If he knows who is who.  This also could be a spelling test.  It could be an intelligence test.  But I can guarantee you that it will be funny.  Rich Voss, at Rich Voss on Twitter, right here for you.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  Speaking of speaking idiot, we got a little quiz for you.  A little pop quiz, Rich.  This early?  Hope you're up for it.  Yes.  All right.  Yes, this early.  Go ahead.  We're going to find out if you're smarter than a fifth grader. 
[03:45:30]  Please, where's the fifth grader?  Huh?  Yeah, where?  Well, we don't know.  Uncle Paul.  Well, we got a test, right?  What a Vera.  This is a test that a fifth grader would take, right?  Yeah.  And we hand it over to you, and you're going to answer these questions.  No problem.  Don't you think we should have a little more time for this?  Yeah, I'm going to give it to you now, and after the break, you should be done.  It's only ten questions.  You mean I have to answer them?  No, ask them now.  You don't need to wait. 
[03:46:00]  We don't need to wait.  We don't have to study this.  This is not...  These are all yes and no kind of answers.  All right.  Finish the following sentence, Rich.  I before E except after...  I before E except after C.  All right, good.  Was that right?  Yes, of course.  Yeah, but that rule doesn't always work.  I hate that rule.  It's a dumb rule.  It's like, oh, except when I'm spelling something.  Right.  Then it's wrong, and I look like an idiot.  I don't want to mislead anybody.  I'm not a great speller, so that was...  I just don't want to mislead everybody with answering that one. 
[03:46:30]  I spelled my daughter's name wrong.  I've got to change her name.  Oh, I saw Rich Voss' daughter backstage.  He was part of Dennis Leary and Friends last week, and by the way, Rich was awesome on  that stage, once again, you were great.  Thank you.  Had a great set.  They went backstage and saw your baby girl and said congratulations to Bonnie, and she's  beautiful, by the way.  Your baby girl's beautiful.  Thank you.  And then I found out that he effed up her name.  What's her name? 
[03:47:00]  Well, see, here's what happened.  I was looking up biblical names, and...  You're not religious.  I know, but it's just good.  You're not a man of God.  How is Ezekiel?  God, he called her.  So I saw...  Well, the first name I saw was Basha, and nobody liked Basha.  Basha?  How can they?  Basha Voss?  Well, we didn't.  I didn't name her.  Basha!  Come here, Basha!  It's right on the globe. 
[03:47:30]  It's where Basha lives.  Yeah, Basha.  That's awful.  Wow.  Okay, so Reina...  So I saw Reina, and that's pure.  Reina's not bad, okay.  Reina, oh, thank you.  So it was R-E-Y-N-A.  It meant pure and clean, a biblical pure and clean Yiddish name.  So like three weeks later, we had the baby, and he asked to spell the name, and I just  go R-A-Y-N-A.  So now I have a Spanish queen instead of a...  That's right.  Instead of a...  You won't be the first Spanish queen you've had. 
[03:48:00]  So how are you supposed to spell it?  R-A...  Well, I spell it R-A-Y-N-A, but I got to go change it to R-E-Y-N-A at some point.  Yeah, why don't you go do that soon?  What direction do you have to travel to go from St. Louis to Kansas City?  I don't know that one either.  This is a test that a fifth grader would take.  From St. Louis to Kansas City, you'd have to go east.  All right, very good.  That's one wrong.  Well, it depends.  If you're going around the world, you'd go east.  That's a long way.  What is the symbol between the parentheses called? 
[03:48:30]  It's the symbol that looks like the Procter & Gamble.  Yeah, it means...  Or A-T-N-T.  It looks like General Mills.  It's a General Mills symbol.  Yeah, it's that thing in the A-T-N-T logo.  Yeah.  There's a name for that?  Yes, the Basha.  Yeah, what is it?  Basha.  What is it called?  Well, let's go with two wrong.  I have a little layman.  He just let the pitch go by.  All strike on himself. 
[03:49:00]  We would have accepted the and sign.  What is it called, though?  The ampersand or whatever.  Oh, no.  A fifth grader can't say that.  At least the ones I've met.  All right.  Not bad.  Once you've met, can't even say no.  One out of three so far, Voss.  In dry weight, how many ounces are in a pound?  16.  There you go.  That's easy, right?  Yeah, I used to sell pot, man.  That's why he knows.  Yep.  Ask me grams, ounces. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  Which of the following inventions was not invented in China?  You got gunpowder.  You got cultured pearls.  You got kites.  And you got paper.  One of those was not invented in China.  Oh.  Gunpowder, cultured pearls, kites, paper.  Okay.  I think I got this one.  I know disease wouldn't be the answer. 
[03:50:00]  I would have to go with...  Wait, what?  There's a lot of disease.  How did that happen when no one even pushed a button?  I don't know.  God did it.  What are you talking about?  Disease.  It's not even one of the...  I'm trying to go something funny.  A SARS joke or something like that.  Yeah, thank you.  I get you.  It's not one of the choices.  Okay, I didn't hear the...  Gunpowder, paper, kites.  Kites like you fly a kite.  Yeah.  Are you looking at my answers over there?  I swear to God, I'm not.  I couldn't see that far anyhow.  All right.  Or what was the fourth one? 
[03:50:30]  Gunpowder, kites, paper, cultured pearls.  Oh, cultured pearls.  What?  That's right.  Yeah.  I just want it to be wrong.  All right.  We'll take the second half of the quiz after.  I would have said paper.  You know, and here's another thing, too.  Tyrus.  You could ask me any of these questions this weekend at the brokerage, and I guarantee in  Long Island I won't get any of them wrong.  You really want these people to ask these questions?  At the brokerage?  No.  Are you crazy?  No.  Do you understand what our fans are capable of doing? 
[03:51:00]  You know, answering as poorly as he did.  So I'm two out of, what am I, two and two?  You have three right out of five.  That's not bad.  So you're barely passing, I guess?  No.  Is 60 a passing grade?  No.  That's not 60.  Oh, it is.  All right.  You're around a D right now.  We got the last five questions after the break, okay?  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  All right.  Here's your next question. 
[03:51:30]  Are you smarter than a fifth grade or Rich Voss?  This is a fifth grade exam.  In square inches, what is the surface area of a cube with five-inch sides?  How many inches would that be in square inches?  Five times five would be 25.  All right.  Wait.  I don't even know if that's right.  That's right.  Of course it's not.  I don't know if it is.  Of course it's not right.  Wait.  No.  Oh, wait.  Five times five times five.  No, wait.  Oh, my God.  In square inches, what is the surface area of a cube with five-inch sides? 
[03:52:00]  Oh, 20 inches.  How do you know how big it is, though?  It's square inches.  You don't know how big the cube is to begin with.  Hold on.  Five-inch sides.  So you got five times five.  25, and then times that by six.  Five to the fourth power.  Oh, no.  That's right.  By six.  Yeah.  I thought it was like five saying it had five sides.  I don't know how it's a cube.  I thought you were saying how many square inches in a five-by-five inch. 
[03:52:30]  Well, that's wonderful.  Yeah.  You're wrong.  It is how many square inches of surface area on a five-  On a cube or on a flat-  A cube.  On a cube.  Well, let's say it's wrong.  120.  Let's say I got it wrong.  It is wrong.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Sean.  Yeah, 141.  Boss, that's not your IQ sign.  That's your SAT score.  Hey, go, Jimmy.  Hi, sir.  Oh, sorry about that.  All right.  The next question for you, Rich Boss.  What's the answer?  It was 150. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No fifth-graders get that, right?  You have to take the 25 and then times that by six, like Ann said.  How do you get 25, though?  Five-  Because five times five.  It's a five-inch square on each side of the cube.  But if it's a square, why would you go five times?  Because it's five inches across and five inches down.  Oh, okay.  Five times five.  What fifth-grader?  A fifth-grader goes to, like, a men's school or something gets that right? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, I guess, Rich.  You're right.  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962?  Oh, that was the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, the Russian Missile Crisis.  Oh, my God.  Wait, there was no World War III.  Didn't the Russian Missile Crisis last all the way up until, like, the Cold War ended?  Wait, in 62, when Kennedy was president, what almost brought us to the brink of war, you said?  Yeah.  World War III.  Almost.  Yes. 
[03:54:00]  Well, it didn't happen, so it had to be almost.  Well, it's the brink.  Saying it's the brink means almost.  He tried to show his intelligence by going, almost, right?  Almost to the brink.  Almost to the brink.  So, almost.  Brink, isn't that where you skate?  No, that's what you do with your eyes.  Steve from Bayshore is writing, Voss times dumb times ass.  It's making a little formula.  Yeah.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when... 
[03:54:30]  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  No, it's a rifle for a Billy Joel song.  I was born...  Okay, wait, no.  Bernie Getz, AIDS, crack, homeless vets?  No.  Five years old.  Yeah, I get it.  You were five in 62.  I think.  But, you know, you're now an adult, and you should know what happened in 62.  I know it.  In 62.  Uh-huh.  Malcolm or one of them, they weren't shooting...  No, that...  How would that be World War III?  Malcolm in the middle? 
[03:55:00]  Malcolm was assassinated by a Russian.  All right, what do you got?  The Russkies didn't get him.  I love how this comes right on the heels of his 141 IQ.  Yeah, what's your official answer?  My official?  Yeah.  Can I give you a official?  Your final answer.  Your final answer.  Let's go.  My final...  In 62?  What happened in 62?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  The Six-Day War.  No, that was in...  Oh, my God.  What was the Six-Day War?  We're talking about the brink of World War III. 
[03:55:30]  Complete annihilation of the globe.  And you're naming all these innocuous things.  Yeah.  That cab driver got robbed in Tel Aviv?  No.  Oh, Rich.  What is it?  Can we come back to any of these?  No.  What is it?  It's to revisit them.  What is it?  Come on, Rich.  Yeah.  It wasn't...  It's something to do with Kennedy. 
[03:56:00]  I don't want to...  Come on.  I'm not the king, Jr.  Yep.  Yep.  That's what he's hearing.  Come on.  Come on.  You can do it.  You can do it, Rich.  Uh-oh.  Here comes the gong.  You know, when I hear it, I'm going to go...  We'll need an answer.  Oh.  That's what's going to happen.  All right.  Well, here's...  It was the Cuban Missile Crisis with Kennedy. 
[03:56:30]  Oh.  Did you say that?  I said that was the first thing I said.  Was it?  That was the first...  Was it?  The first one you said was Bay of Pigs.  You said Bay of Pigs.  Then you said...  That was the Cuban Missile...  You said the Russian...  No, I said...  You go...  The Bay of Pigs was not the Cuban Missile Crisis.  It was the first thing, Rich.  Bay of Pigs was going to invade to get Castro out.  Yeah.  Well, I said the Cuban Missile...  Play the tape back.  You said the Russian Missile... 
[03:57:00]  No, I said...  I will bet $200.  You said the Russian Missile Crisis.  $200.  I'll bet more than that, because I know I heard it.  I'm just being nuts.  Russian Missile Crisis.  You got singles in there.  Why are you looking for your money?  He said it wrong because he's an adult.  But I think I have to give that one to Voss.  He knew what it was.  He's just not an articulate man.  We're playing by...  No, we're playing by the rules of, you know, Wheel of Fortune.  I'm not betting I could...  I got $100, right?  Oh, yeah, you can't gamble.  It's not gambling.  How about it's a bet? 
[03:57:30]  How about if I'm right, I get to punch you?  No, that's gambling.  And if you're wrong, I get to.  Yeah.  All right, well...  Do we give it to him?  I guess we have to.  He just said it wrong.  He's not an articulate man.  All right, we'll give it to you.  But your first answer was Bay of Pigs.  Your second answer was Russian Missile Crisis.  It is the Cuban Missile Crisis.  I have a non-vote in this.  Well, here's what I say.  Forget that question.  Find another question.  All right, here.  Well, you only got three questions left.  Let's see if you could pass a fifth grade test.  What is the verb of the following sentence? 
[03:58:00]  The goat ran into the barn.  Boom.  The beyond.  The goat ran.  Ran.  Is that your final answer?  Yeah, ran.  All right, very good.  Spell the opposite of vertical.  Horizontal.  Perfect.  I got to spell it?  Yes, you got to spell it.  Oh, where are these questions?  Yeah, I don't know where these questions are.  I only have ten.  I only have up to ten.  We jazzed it up because some of those questions were kind of like... 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, they were lame.  Horizontal.  I'm sorry, we had a revised quiz.  Wait, hold on.  Horizontal.  Okay.  Horizontal.  H-O-R-I-Z-O-N-T-A-L.  Nope.  E.  I can't believe you fell for that.  I gave him the hand, like the hand, like, you know, come on, you're almost there. 
[03:59:00]  One more letter.  He goes, E.  E.  Tell me, E, I love you.  I really do.  Bonnie's a lucky woman.  Well, I was right, though.  Horizontal.  Yeah, we'll give that one to you.  I F'd you up.  By going.  Yeah, yeah, come on.  And finally, who was the U.S. president when World War II ended?  Get this right, you'll get a 70 on the test.  It's either Roosevelt or Eisenhower.  Okay.  I would have to say...  You almost said Eisenheimer, like Weisenheimer.  You're such an old man. 
[03:59:30]  No, I didn't.  It was Roosevelt.  All right.  Very good.  That's wrong.  By the way, not only is it wrong, he was dead.  Who?  Roosevelt was dead at the end of the war.  Of World War II?  Yes.  It was taft, Rich.  So, if it wasn't Roosevelt...  Honest Abe.  So, if it wasn't Roosevelt, who was it?  Well, the end of World War II was in the...  Then it was Eisenhower.  Was in what?  In the 50s.  The end of World War II was in the 50s, and if it wasn't... 
[04:00:00]  So, you're now saying Eisenhower, right?  I said Roosevelt, and you guys...  All right, he was wrong, so you're now saying Eisenhower.  Well, why would you give me a second chance?  I'm just asking.  Yeah, it was Roosevelt or Eisenhower.  All right, wrong again.  Now, who...  I can't be wrong twice.  Yeah, because your choices were both wrong.  The war ended with the dropping of the atomic bombs.  Who dropped the bombs?  Who was the president that was in office when the bombs dropped on Japan? 
[04:00:30]  Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  No, he wasn't the president.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki was not our president.  He's the commissioner of Japanese baseball.  He was the president during...  Ouch.  Yeah.  Why?  I didn't hear it.  He was Roosevelt's vice president.  Oh, it was...  What do you call it?  Good.  It was...  141.  Yeah, go ahead.  What do you call it?  Go ahead.  What do you call it?  Roosevelt's vice president.  Yeah.  Yeah, come on.  I know you got this one. 
[04:01:00]  It wasn't Spiro-Lag.  I had more brains after the suicide.  What's that?  Nothing.  Go ahead.  Roosevelt's vice president.  Obama.  Give us the answer, Rich.  Well...  Inside of your head is a Florida swamp.  Go ahead.  As you think about it, Steve from Syracuse has something.  Steve, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, boy?  Hey.  Well, I got to tell you, I was looking in the shower and answering the questions, and  I think Voss originally was... 
[04:01:30]  You know, he should be...  You know, are you smarter than a preschooler?  And I think that if Harry Truman was alive right now, he'd be kicking Voss' ass.  It was Truman.  It was Truman.  I knew that.  He just gave an answer.  Oh, he was talking about a guy he went to school with, Harry Truman.  Yeah.  Harry Truman.  Was it Truman?  Truman.  It's too late.  It was Truman.  Was it Truman?  Truman.  Nobody's really big on President's tribute.  By the way, Steve...  President, he's probably one of the more memorable ones, being the one that, you know, dropped 
[04:02:00]  the atomic bombs.  By the way...  Truman.  That didn't actually end World War II.  Oh, it didn't?  Boy, and quickly.  It didn't.  I mean, what was the World War where Germany was going and taking, you know, just out of  control?  That was World War II.  That was the Korean War, Rich.  That was World War II.  Yeah.  And World War I.  And then what was the war where the Japanese were involved and we dropped two atomic bombs?  That was World War II where they hooked up with Germany.  Very good.  Okay. 
[04:02:30]  But...  But...  Oh, no.  Germany...  Oh, no.  Here comes the button.  Maybe.  Like, I'm not really on top of this.  Right.  Really?  Yeah.  By this, you mean everything.  Here's what happened.  Yeah, what happened?  Germany was still...  After we dropped the bomb, Germany didn't just say, hey, we're done.  We still had to go in.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus on a cross.  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  Whatever happened...  So, you have no idea that Germany had already surrendered and the war in Europe 
[04:03:00]  and Europe was over by the time we really concentrated our forces over there in Japan and stuff.  See, we beat the Germans first.  Then we beat the Japanese.  I gotta, you know, I gotta read a little more.  Yeah, you gotta brush up a little.  Ask me about...  Hold on.  Do you think the Germans had just laid down their weapons after we bombed Hiroshima?  Yes, they did.  I wanna get rid of Steve from Syracuse listening on 95X.  Steve, you had a great line there. 
[04:03:30]  You wanna use it or what?  I'd say, yeah, man.  Go ahead.  Voss, you need to go on.  You need to go on.  Are you smarter than a preschooler?  Or maybe even are you smarter than a fetus?  That's what I think.  All right, sir.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Well, I mean...  Well...  And as a Jew, you should know these things.  Well, ask me about the six-day war.  Never forget.  With you, it's never, ever new.  Yes.  Ask me how long the six-day war lasted.  All right.  Six days.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey. 
[04:04:00]  Mike.  That's actually a myth.  Mike.  It didn't last for six days.  Right.  That's good.  Two months.  You need to have Voss on every week to do this because this is friggin' hilarious.  And he's being serious, by the way.  Yes, he is.  You got a 60 on a fifth grade test today.  That's not bad.  It's a passing grade.  He's not being ironic.  Well, here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  All right.  Let's go to Matt in Pennsylvania.  Matt.  Hey, Voss, could you spell IQ?  E-Y-E.  What does IQ stand for? 
[04:04:30]  Intellectual quotations.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  We've been searching for a long time.  We found the new spaz.  Intellectual quotations.  We got the new spaz in studio.  Quotations.  Intellectual, uh, whatever.  The Q, I don't know.  Intellectual quiz.  I just say I'm queer. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, God.  Intellectual quiz.  Wow.  What is it really?  I don't know that one.  Your IQ, which you are saying, is 141.  141.  Yet you have no idea what IQ stands for.  I know how to get to it on the internet.  IQ test.  IQ.  Intellectual quiz.  What do you think it stands for?  Quotient.  Intelligence quotient.  That's that same thing.  Intellectual quiz.  Intellectual, um, quotation.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Dan and Philly.  I love Rich Voss. 
[04:05:30]  Oh.  Dan, go ahead.  You guys got to chain him to a chair and never let him leave.  Yeah.  Hey, Voss, you should get a nameplate for your death that says the schmuck stops here.  And let's go to Lori in Jersey.  Lori.  Hi, how are you?  Hey, good.  Um, the thing is that, to be fair, uh, history classes, he might not be just, he just might  not have the history, uh, down.  He probably failed it when he was in school.  What?  But, he might have failed history while he was in school. 
[04:06:00]  Oh, right, yes.  Uh, but, to be fair, um...  Fair?  He is Jewish.  I mean, you learn World War II history in Hebrew school.  Did you go to Hebrew school?  Yeah.  Did you go to Hebrew school?  I didn't pay attention.  I couldn't understand English.  How am I going to understand Hebrew school?  What's wrong with you?  Basically, you say, Voss is Jewish and doesn't know about World War II.  I know, I know a lot about it.  What do you know about it?  Thank you, Lori.  What's that?  You didn't know who surrendered.  I, I know, I know Roosevelt didn't bomb the train. 
[04:06:30]  Was it Roosevelt?  Or, uh, who was the other one you were talking about?  Truman?  You're naming people who didn't bomb the Japanese.  No, not to...  Who didn't bomb what?  I just want to know where you were going with that one.  I love this World War II stuff.  I'm sorry.  I love your World War II material.  You just go into your basement and live it every day.  Ken Burns has competition.  I can't wait for your documentary there, Rich.  I'll tell you, listen, I'm serious.  I'll take an IQ test here.  How are they doing here?  Not today. 
[04:07:00]  No.  Because...  No, we got something...  Oh, well, we could do that.  Yeah, we should definitely...  We got Max in Dallas.  Max, go ahead.  Hey, ONA.  What's up, Dukas?  Uh, I've got the perfect idea for you.  A dumb-off between Boston and Francine.  Let's do it.  Next week.  A dumb-off.  Can you come in next week?  Yes.  We're working Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday next week?  Killer, though.  Yeah.  I'll go with Bobby Kelly.  That's who he thinks he's smarter than me.  Bobby should be involved.  Bob is as stupid as they come.  Bobby, and he's always saying how dumb I am. 
[04:07:30]  I'm smarter than Bobby.  Okay, I'll take Bobby on.  That's not saying a lot.  Bobby.  All right, we're going to get Bobby, we're going to get you, and we're going to get Francine.  Hopefully next week.  Can you guys try to make that happen immediately?  Yeah.  And we'll have a fifth-grade exam.  No, we can have a real one.  I'm talking about...  This is a real one, obviously.  You got a 60.  You know what?  I'm talking about some serious questions that, you know...  Oh, yes.  Good questions about World War II.  Yeah.  And then the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Yeah, that's trivial events of the last century. 
[04:08:00]  Those are just dumb.  You're right.  I bet you can't explain the whole Bay of Pigs.  What was it about?  What...  I know...  Can you?  All right, go ahead.  What is it?  What happened?  What was the Bay of Pigs about?  What happened was...  Teach us.  Okay, we were over there.  This is why Kennedy was assassinated, because we were over there.  We had a lot of money invested in casinos and over there.  And Castro was taken over, pushing out into a dictatorship.  And we were going to lose all our money there, so the mob...  Pushing out dictatorship.  No, he was pushing out the regime to take over as a dictator in the country. 
[04:08:30]  Okay?  So, the rebels wanted to overthrow Castro, as this was happening, and was seeking the help  of America.  America, and, you know, it's all history from there.  I love just watching you unravel.  I actually saw beads of sweat forming on your forehead in the middle of that.  I'm just trying to remember the godfather. 
[04:09:00]  The godfather!  I don't think it had much to do with casinos at that point.  I think it had to do with a communist country being 90 miles off of Florida.  Yeah, but the rebels didn't want to deal with Castro.  He was just out of control.  Well, we kind of didn't want to deal with Castro.  Yeah, but if you know...  And there was a rebellion against Castro, but it wasn't very strong.  So, we said, look, we're going to give you guys a hand.  We'll back you up if you take on Castro. 
[04:09:30]  We'll train you.  We'll give you support.  We can't be directly involved.  So, it was a CIA kind of, you know, covert thing.  I feel like I'm in school.  I'm looking at the teacher right now.  And when it finally happened, we kind of hung them out to dry  and didn't give them the support that we promised them,  and they wound up getting their asses handed to them.  That's basically what I was saying.  And it failed.  Didn't people think that that was a secret deal cut to kind of make the Cuban Missile Crisis go away, I think? 
[04:10:00]  To make the Cuban Missile Crisis go away.  Yeah, because during the Cuban Missile Crisis, they were pointed at us.  Yeah, there is speculation that all that's tied together.  They were pointed at us.  They were pointed at us.  What?  The missiles.  All right, let's go to Tim in Pennsylvania.  Tim, what's up?  I just love history.  You should have CokeLogic doing animation with Rich Voss with a World War II map behind him trying to explain all this.  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be great.  CokeLogic will come up with some.  Mark in New York, what's up? 
[04:10:30]  That's the best bit.  Bravo, fellas.  That's the best bit I've heard in weeks and weeks and weeks.  We're not even trying.  It's just the basic crap.  Fred in New York, what's up?  Yes, his boss is smarter than a crack baby.  Let's go to Tom in Jersey.  You got the phones lit there, Rich.  You're doing something right.  Tom, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Rich is teaching special ed today, huh?  Ooh.  Well, so much for the phone.  Joe. 
[04:11:00]  Save us.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I've got a question for you over, Richard.  Who was the president when Kennedy was shot?  Oh, that's a good question.  When Kennedy, he was the president when Kennedy was shot.  Of course, he was the president.  What kind of question is that?  I got that one.  He was trying to trick you.  I know.  Yeah, it was a trick question.  And he almost had you.  No.  Hey, you know what?  There's a little paranoia in your life.  You know, listen, let me explain something about me.  Okay.  Uh, I quit school. 
[04:11:30]  Okay.  But.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I have 141 IQ.  I know.  Like, never believe that.  I will never believe that.  I used to run a business.  Like, you know what?  Let me explain something.  Dealing drugs is not a business.  I used to have.  Can we take an IQ test after the break?  How long does it take?  I say.  How long does it take?  It does take a while.  And he'd have to be sequestered somewhere.  Can we put him in the glass booth?  Yeah.  I'll do that.  Next week we'll do the.  Dude, I will put. 
[04:12:00]  I know you're not a gambler, but I will just leave $1,000, like sitting over here.  If you score more than a three.  And if you score.  A three.  And if you get within 10 points of 141, you could just steal my money.  It's not gambling.  I'll just leave it here.  It's just laying around.  I understand you're in recovery, so it's not a bet.  That's good.  But I will just leave $1,000 out.  And I'll just leave it.  I'll leave and go, oh, man, I forgot my money.  No.  First of all, here's how you do it. 
[04:12:30]  Leave GH's money alone.  I don't want your money.  What I want is you just to say.  Vindication is what you want.  Because when I was 21 years old, 20 before I went into the mental institution, when I was  20, around that area.  Yeah.  I used to run.  I had seven guys working for me.  Like, there's certain things I'm smart at.  You know what I mean?  Like, I used to run a business.  I had seven employees when I was 20 years old.  Back then, paying them like $8.  Now, I used to.  I had contracts all over town, paying the houses and remodeling them and stuff. 
[04:13:00]  Okay?  And whenever I filled out a contract or picked up the money, no one ever asked me, okay,  so you're going to paint the peaks, you're going to put shingles on, and never threw in  a World War II question.  You're street smart.  I get it.  That's street smart business.  I know business.  You know how to get more drugs from a drug dealer.  By dressing sexy.  I get it.  You're street smart.  Lingy, lingy.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Brokerage this weekend.  Yes.  Friday and Saturday, Rich will be at the Brokerage Comedy Club in Belmore, New York. 
[04:13:30]  Okay?  I'll be at the Providence Comedy Connection this Friday, Saturday in Rhode Island.  Okay.  So if you're in Providence, come on down.  Have some laughs.  Speaking of comedians, we've got Jim Jeffries in the green room.  I saw him at the Dennis Leary and Friends thing last week as part of the New York Comedy  Festival.  Man, the first time I saw him live, the guy's hilarious.  Did he get punched?  Well, ask him.  I don't know.  We'll ask him.  Is he the guy that got punched?  I don't know.  I worked with him in England a couple weeks ago.  He is really, really funny.  Like, he was the one comic that sat with me and told, like, when I was in England taping  a TV show a couple weeks ago, he was like, he was so nice. 
[04:14:00]  Like, you know, speaking of World War II, who would think that, you know, an enemy from  World War II, and you would be able to go there and play in England now, and there wouldn't  be a problem.  What am I supposed to say?  What am I supposed to say?  By the way, Tony and Reno are saying that Voss' IQ is leaking out of me.  I love him.  Leaking out of his ear there.  You know what you are?  You're a rock with teeth. 
[04:14:30]  Hey, hey, hey, no one join.  This is the worst OPN3, Sirius XM. </pre>
