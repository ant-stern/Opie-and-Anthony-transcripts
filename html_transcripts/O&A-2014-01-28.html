<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a vehement critique of Macklemore, focusing on his perceived hypocrisy and "white guilt," particularly referencing a text message to Kendrick Lamar that he then posted on Instagram.  The hosts questioned the authenticity of Macklemore's public persona and engaged in a humorous, often crude, discussion about various expressions of gay identity, referencing *All in the Family* clips featuring Archie Bunker's interactions with a gay character. They shared personal anecdotes about their own experiences with gay people growing up.  This segment continued with a detailed analysis of Macklemore's song "White Privilege," further dissecting its lyrics and expressing continued skepticism about the artist's sincerity.  The hosts also questioned the historical accuracy of some of Macklemore's claims in the song, specifically those relating to Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix; a listener then called in to correct Macklemore's inaccuracies.  The show then transitioned to a segment featuring Dr. Ian Smith, who was participating in a weight-loss challenge with two of the show's staff members, E-Rock and Roland.  This segment included updates on their progress, humorous anecdotes about Dr. Smith's delivery of a large amount of popcorn, and arguments about the efficacy of Dr. Smith's Shred diet versus Vinnie Tortorich's plan.  Roland's admitted deviation from the Shred diet and financial struggles were discussed at length. Live weigh-ins were conducted, and a listener called in to offer an independent calculation of the weight loss percentages. The segment concluded with a female co-host receiving a spanking from E-Rock, which escalated into playful yelling and expletives.

Penn Jillette then joined the broadcast.  The conversation shifted to the deceptive nature of television and the ease with which audiences can be manipulated, using Jillette's experience with a complex card trick on *Saturday Night Live* as an example. He detailed the behind-the-scenes maneuvering and the conflict with the FCC and NBC executives over the "live" chyron, including humorous descriptions of the production process.  Jillette also discussed his new movie, *Tim's Vermeer*, his appearance on *Fool Us*, and a rare Beatles "Butcher Cover" album he owned.  Louis C.K. called in briefly during this segment.

Louis C.K. then became a guest on the show.  The conversation began with a discussion of his experience getting high and watching movies, specifically criticizing *Gravity*.  This transitioned into a humorous role-playing scenario about the astronaut application process, followed by a lengthy discussion of Louis C.K.'s boating experiences, including near-misses and frightening situations at sea. He criticized Robert Redford's *All Is Lost*. A caller, Dan from Maine, shared a harrowing tale of his fishing boat sinking after being hit by an oil tanker.  The conversation then shifted to Louis C.K.'s work on *American Hustle*, the release of his 1998 film *Tomorrow Night*, and his current television show.  The segment concluded with a discussion about traffic flow, inconsiderate drivers, and Louis C.K.'s own aggressive driving habits, featuring anecdotes and humorous observations about human behavior.

A later segment focused entirely on Louis C.K.'s aggressive driving habits and road rage incidents. He recounted numerous confrontations with other drivers, including a near-fight with a truck driver, confrontations with a bus driver and a double-parked truck driver, and an incident involving a paparazzo photographing Michael Bubl√©. He also described intentionally throwing rocks at slow drivers and confronting college students urinating on a front door.  The hosts and Louis C.K. discussed the absurdity of his actions and potential legal ramifications.  Listener calls about traffic frustrations were included, and the segment concluded with Louis C.K. promoting his upcoming shows and his 1998 movie.  A mention was made of an alleged incident involving Justin Bieber's hair.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Oh yeah, I'm with you on that one.  Macklemore's an asshole.  Yeah, Macklemore continues to be an asshole. We're not buying his bullshit.  He just continues to be such a douchebag.  What is he doing now? He's apologizing for being...  White.  White?  That's pretty much what he did.  You think?  Yeah.  What is it? Kendrick Lamar, he sent a little text message to Kendrick Lamar. 
[00:00:30]  Uh-huh.  He wrote, you got robbed. I wanted you to win.  You should have. It's weird and sucks that I robbed you.  I was going to say that during the speech.  Then the music started playing during my speech and I froze.  Anyway, you know what it is. Congrats on this year and your music.  Appreciate you as an artist and as a friend. Much love.  And then he Instagrams the fact that he texted Kendrick Lamar that.  Of course he did. What a just guilt-ridden white person he is. 
[00:01:00]  I think this goes further than him just being a white man.  Well, it is.  I understand the white guilt thing.  He doesn't want to be vanilla ice.  But this guy is just a phony.  He's a phony.  He really is a phony.  He's a phony.  Groveling slob.  Groveling.  With this tolerance and with this, oh gosh, really me?  Enough with the gosh, really me crap with these musicians.  Taylor Swift does that shit too.  Yeah, all the time.  We were talking about him yesterday and came to the conclusion, 
[00:01:30]  no one can be that accepting of everything and everybody that is walking the earth.  You think when they fuck up his order at Starbucks, he's just sitting there like accepting,  like, oh, okay, well, I understand, all right, well.  You know, I understand, I understand, because that'll happen, yo, that'll happen.  Oh, with his wigger voice that he puts on.  Does he talk with the slang, the accent?  Of course he does.  I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying that he's that nice.  He's very calculated. 
[00:02:00]  He knows it's a hot topic right now to be tolerant, so he's fitting into that track for a while.  There was an article on Spin's website talking about this text message saying that it's just,  they said it's a microcosm of what irks people about Macklemore in the first place,  is that he can't do anything without turning it back on him and patting himself on the back.  He sends a text to Kendrick, but then he has to show everybody not only what he did,  but also that they're friends.  He seems sincere.  Much love.  Yeah, if it's real, you just write the text. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  But then what, he Instagrammed the text?  He Instagrammed it.  Oh, my God, that's embarrassing.  Why would you do that?  Green lab and Instagram.  Why?  Hey, this is a text I just sent to Kendrick.  It would be up to Kendrick to go, wow, you know, Lamar, Lamar, sorry, Macklemore reached out to me,  and this is what he said.  Then that'd be all right.  But you can't be the guy.  No, you can't be the guy.  You can't be the guy that says, look how nice I am.  Look at me.  I fucking rule. 
[00:03:00]  It's like showing your receipt from a charity organization and fucking Twittering it.  It's like, look how much I gave.  Right.  I'm so giving.  Right.  Oh, fuck him.  This is the moment.  Fuck him.  I thought I was gay.  He won a lot of awards, though.  You gay.  Well, he said he was robbed.  Well, just thinking he might have been gay in the third grade is just so stupid.  No one thinks they're gay in the third grade.  Well, let's slow down. 
[00:03:30]  Welcome back, Timmy.  Welcome back.  We strongly think there's no way you can know anything in the third grade.  There's a very few.  In the third grade, you're just sitting there going, wow, boobies.  Unless you are gay.  And like, like, you know, the ridiculous gay.  But I don't even think you know that.  But you just don't know it.  You don't know what it is.  You just know what you, like, want and like.  You don't know if I'm gay or anything.  Man, I grew up extremely at a slow pace.  Because I had no fucking idea of any of that shit. 
[00:04:00]  None.  Not a clue.  Nothing.  I don't know when I became aware of the gay.  I imagine your dick was in a mouth.  Hey, it's gay.  I became aware of the gay.  I know one of my relatives, like a cousin, a second cousin or something, was gay.  Oh, boy.  How do you guys like that one?  Oh, you know. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, is Twinkle Toe showing up?  He'd do all that stuff.  Oh, yeah.  He's a little light in the loafers.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is he going to come?  He'd say things like that.  Is he going to come fluttering into the room?  Oh, really?  That's just so not right.  Oh, yeah.  And his father was...  Did you know that wasn't right as a kid, or you just went along with it?  Yeah, I knew it was something going on, but I didn't know that there was, you know, there  was a sexual aspect to it.  I just thought, you know, oh, he's like a fairy kind of thing. 
[00:05:00]  Right, right, right.  And, you know.  Yeah, he's kind of like girlish.  I don't think I mean...  His father was like a Marine and shit like that.  And he used to just sit in the chair in like a catatonic state.  The Marine?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And all I think now is that he was just sitting there the entire time staring at the TV just  thinking, my son's gay.  My son's gay.  Holy shit.  My fucking son's gay.  This was the 70s.  Four hours a day.  The 70s, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Come a long way from the 70s.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  He, yeah, but he was really gay.  And then I think he, yeah, he went full gay.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What's going full gay?  Like Magic Johnson's son full gay or just...  Yeah, yeah, like very flamboyant.  Wow.  That's going in full gay, right?  Full gay.  Just doing the whole gay.  You think some gays hold back from going full gay?  Some gays hold back.  They don't want to go full gay.  You think they all want to go full gay?  I think any gay guy wants to go full gay. 
[00:06:00]  Really?  Just the voice, the mannerisms.  I think there's just a spectrum of gay.  You think there's a spectrum?  Yeah.  You think there's a gradient?  I don't think every gay wants to go full gay.  You can go full gay?  No.  All look like Liberace?  Yeah, yeah, that flamboyant.  They want to strut and be sassy.  If it was up to them and they were in a perfect world, they would just be all gay.  So gay.  They would look like CeeLo.  Full gay.  Even though I don't know what the fuck CeeLo's into, but he gives an impression that he enjoys 
[00:06:30]  being a bit flamboyant.  I think like strutting your stuff, hand on hip, fucking walking around, the wrist.  You really think every gay guy would want to go full gay like that?  I think that's like the gay dream.  The gay dream come true of tolerance is being able to go out like that and be accepted.  They all want to wear what?  Like just women's clothes?  Women's clothes.  Feminine.  Very flamboyant.  Flamboyant. 
[00:07:00]  Flamboyant.  A lot of sequins and bedazzled fucking jackets.  Things like that.  Blitter in the hair.  I've known you way too long.  And I don't believe you.  I just don't believe you.  I know you're not that silly.  Well, maybe I like to think that this is the gay world we could live in.  I got to defend the show because who knows what they take from us and try to fucking fuck  us over with.  There's no way you believe that. 
[00:07:30]  I don't know.  Well, it's not offensive.  It's just saying there are so many levels of how people want to present themselves as  gay Americans.  Some people, if you go down to the parade on Halloween, it's very flamboyant.  Right.  You know, there's a lot of costumes.  But a lot of the gays would say that, you know, those are the ones giving them a bad  fucking...  Well, that's true, but...  Rep.  You know, what's bad about it?  Who cares?  Bad rep.  They don't like that flamboyant shit.  I think it's fine.  Because they're trying to get real things done and then you got, you know, some weird 
[00:08:00]  shit happening in those parades.  Yeah.  But the way gays are presented in movies, too, it's always like, okay, girlfriend.  You know, it's not like just a regular dude at work doing his shit and then he just  happens to be gay.  What about Brokeback Mountain?  That was some regular gay, right?  That was regular gay.  You know, I still haven't seen that fucking movie.  Oh, it's divine.  I have no desire to see that.  You've got to see it.  I don't.  That spit fucking spit scene in the tent is...  I have no desire to see that.  No?  None. 
[00:08:30]  Come on.  That was a courageous roll on both of their parts.  Wow.  They fought over who had to take it.  Wow.  Oof.  I don't know.  I think you've got to be a bit mysterious to take a part like that.  You think?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm not saying that you're, you know...  Was that Jake Gyllenhaal?  I'm not saying that.  And Heath Ledger.  And Heath Ledger, yes.  I don't know.  I think you've got a little...  You think you've got to have...  Yeah.  He spoke about acting in that and how kind of awkward it was. 
[00:09:00]  I don't know.  At least you don't have a question about what to do with your hands and you're firmly wrapping  around a cock.  Yeah.  Or they're over your own mouth so you don't scream being fucking the shitter.  I don't think all gay guys, by the way, want to do that.  I think a lot...  No, man.  I think a lot of them are like just fucking regular dudes and they just...  Yeah.  Because in the straight community you have fucking effeminate guys too.  Everyone's on, yeah, you're on the spectrum of whatever, whether you're straight, gay, 
[00:09:30]  fucking...  Well, then how come every...  Then the gay people should be a little more upset and offended and active when it comes  to their portrayal in every form of media.  Because all you see are those fashion...  Like you watch those fashion shows, the various fashion shows on TV.  They are all over-the-top gay.  I guess because...  Yeah, because they make for good TV.  Well, maybe that's it.  But then it's being exploitive, I think.  I'm sure that eventually they'll go down that road and say, look, man, we're being portrayed 
[00:10:00]  horribly on TV.  I don't think I've ever seen a gay guy on TV that you're just like, oh, that's a guy  that just happens to be gay.  I got one.  Yeah.  Anderson Cooper.  He makes eyes sometimes to look and go.  Jesus, Anthony.  You're a tough critic.  I would hate to have you as a teacher in high school.  Are you crazy?  No, the guy.  He makes a face every so often.  He has a gay face.  He has a weird giggle that comes out every once in a while.  Every so often. 
[00:10:30]  But in general, I think you're seeing Anderson Cooper for the most part.  No, I agree.  I would assume if you met Anderson Cooper off the CNN, he would be very similar to his  on-air persona.  Do you think, or do you think he, you know, gets a little more?  It probably comes out a little more, but I think it's within range.  You know, when he's around his buddies and stuff, maybe hanging out at the bar, he's not  on TV.  You know, there are some people, you ever see that guy, that black guy that was doing  the report and the cricket flew in his mouth?  And he goes, God damn it, country-ass motherfucker. 
[00:11:00]  And he was all like, you know, and today, wait.  I think that might happen with Anderson Cooper, where on air, he's like that.  And then when he's with his friends, he might swish it up a little.  He might a little bit.  Maybe a little taste.  But I don't think it's too far off from what you see on TV.  Oh, there was one on All in the Family.  Remember Archie's gay friend?  Stretch.  Football player?  It wasn't Stretch.  It was this real manly guy, and he sat down with Archie and he's like, I'm gay, Archie.  He's like, oh, man. 
[00:11:30]  What did Archie say?  I don't remember this episode.  He was like, get out of here.  Like he thought it was joking.  And he never accepted it.  Right.  He goes, all right, Arch, you know, whatever you want to think.  And that's because he was goofing on Mike's friend that had like a pocketbook, a little handbag thing.  And he's like, oh, that's gorgeous.  Your place over there.  Can we find that clip?  I want to see that clip.  Archie's gay friend.  Let's say hi to Derek of Long Island.  Derek.  Hey, Dirk. 
[00:12:00]  Yes, that's funny.  You just mentioned All in the Family.  I was going to say the same thing.  Oh.  I'm kind of around your age, and the first time I ever heard the word gay, I read it in Mad Magazine, and I didn't know what it was.  Was it?  But how was it used in Mad Magazine?  Was it a cartoon?  Was it an article?  Oh, well, it must have been a cartoon.  Everything was a cartoon.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  It didn't really write serious articles, I don't think.  Yeah, what am I saying, an article?  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  It was a serious article from Mad Magazine. 
[00:12:30]  So it was a bit serious.  It was gay.  Yeah, exactly.  So there was some satire to it.  Yeah, yeah.  Gotcha.  And don't forget, we grew up being exposed to fucking Paul Lind and, you know, oh-oh.  Right.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Charles Nelson Reilly, but like Ant's bit, which I always like when he does, then those guys would do a regular interview,  and they always would ask him about a lady in their life.  So any chance of marriage, Paul?  I'll hide out now. 
[00:13:00]  And you've got to think, the interviewers and everyone around then, they knew for sure, but it was just a different time.  Well, Lee, you didn't blow up anyone's spots back then.  No, no, no.  Absolutely.  But if you watch Hollywood Squares, the old Hollywood Squares with Paul Lind, he was constantly making gay jokes in the old center square there, you know?  Like self-deprecating gay jokes.  Right.  I didn't know he was gay, though.  I didn't know Charles Nelson Reilly. 
[00:13:30]  I didn't know the village people were gay.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  I had no idea.  No, I mean, I knew the shit that I did wasn't good, but I didn't fucking know that I had no clue.  That they were just gay.  It was just how it was portrayed.  You had no idea.  They were just fun.  Yeah, they were fun.  They were fun and happy.  You'd want them at a party.  Right.  Weren't they just fun?  Oh, boy, would they want me at a party.  I'd say, look out for Mrs. Muir.  Look at the opster.  Well, why don't you come here, Opie? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I got a boat.  Exactly.  I have two apples and a little fleshy pouch.  I was in a Bradley's when I was a kid or something, or a Corvette's, and I didn't know what gay sex was.  So someone told me the village people were gay.  So I asked the woman who worked there, I'm like, what did gay guys do in bed?  Oh, no.  And she just wouldn't talk to me.  Of course not.  And I kept asking her, what are they doing, Ben?  Oh, you just wanted to know.  But I think I kind of knew, but I wanted her to say it.  Yeah, of course you did.  Just start jacking it.  It's a young cuck.  Young cuck. 
[00:14:30]  Jesus.  Oh, there you go.  You found the clip.  Yeah.  Hold on one second.  Thad in Wisconsin.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hello.  How cold is it up there today?  I got negative 13.  Oh.  No.  Wind chill negative 13?  No.  That's regular, regular temperatures.  Regular temperature is negative 13 in Wisconsin today.  He bet.  Holy fuck.  I like how they had to change global warming to climate change.  Right.  It's like now they're right, no matter what happens. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  Come on.  Stop it.  Well, because it always confused people when, you know, global warming.  Global warming.  And then winter hit, and it was like, fuck global warming.  Look, it's cold.  Yeah.  Well, that's like when we were going through maybe a hot spell or something.  There'd be global warming.  And then it's like, well, what about the cold?  And they're like, climate change.  Let's call it climate change.  Minus 13?  That's insane.  I was bitching.  I was walking around yesterday.  I was 25.  I was a little fucking pussy about it.  Anyway, go ahead, Thad.  Yeah, my girlfriend works at a Catholic school. 
[00:15:30]  No.  And I never really had an opinion about this.  And she's not judgmental, but she's got a second grader that he is all in as far as being gay.  All he talks about is princesses and dresses that he wants to wear when he grows up.  Yeah, they're like, they're boys that I think you absolutely know.  Dude, but there had to be kids in our classrooms.  Yeah.  I don't know why they fucking did.  They were sissies.  Oh.  Remember?  You'd call him.  He's a sissy. 
[00:16:00]  Gotcha.  Yeah, yeah.  And you'd be, oh.  All right, now I got a short list of names.  I remember a couple of kids.  There was one in East Islip.  This little red-headed kid.  And he was a sissy.  And then you realize, oh, when you get older, you're, oh, okay.  Gotcha.  He might have been a gee.  All right, well, here's the clip you were talking about from Archie.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, yeah, Archie's a gay friend.  He's all man.  Right.  Can't imagine.  You know he's fucking a top.  Not necessarily.  Oh, you think? 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  Well, you've got to think that they didn't want to go flamboyant with this shit.  No, well, that was the whole thing.  Like then, I mean.  It's like, all right, if we're going to do this gay thing, you're still going to.  Yeah, kind of like.  Oh, man.  Like, quote, like a real man.  That was the whole thing with this episode was Mike Stivik's friend was very flamboyant  and gay-like.  And Archie was calling him gay.  And Mike was like, no, he's not gay.  Like, sure, sure.  But then Archie's friend, who's all man, he turns out to be gay. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, I bet your meathead had a fun.  Oh, did he ever?  A good time with that one.  Because he'd hear rumors.  After the big reveal.  Yes.  Let's see the clip.  Yeah, let her rip.  Is this the one with the guy with the whatever, and a guy who's a queer, is a queer, is that  it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, a four-eye.  A guy that wears glasses is a four-eye.  Right.  A guy that's a fag is a queer, or something like that.  All right.  Take the hands out of that, boy.  Fake jab and let him in the belly.  Get going.  Get him in the belly. 
[00:17:30]  Move that glass.  Watching the fight.  Probably likes a little twink, that big, big fella.  Can you turn it up a little?  Is there any more volume left?  No?  Fuck.  Damn it.  See ya.  Boy, that was some fight there, huh?  Great.  You know something, Arch?  I love those competitions.  Oh, hey, hey. 
[00:18:00]  Take it easy.  Hey.  You know, the law says that mids of yours are lethal weapons.  You're nuts, Arch.  You're a ball player, not a fighter.  Watch your fists.  I'm the size of you, boy.  The strength.  Hey, do me a paper.  Let me try you once a year.  Oh, have another beer.  Come on, come on.  Come on.  Forget it.  One time.  Are you serious?  Watch once the arm wrestle him.  All right, go.  Ah!  Oh, jeez.  Because Meathead already told him, like, a rumor that he heard around town that he's gay.  So now Archie's trying to...  Yeah.  There's no way a gay guy would take him in an arm wrestle match. 
[00:18:30]  Is that what's going on here?  Of course.  But he lost.  Give me a couple of beers over here, would you?  I know.  I mean, they got no regard.  They got no respect for the old institutions.  What institutions, Archie?  Well, you know, like sports, sportsmanship.  There are guts, guns.  The things that separate the sexes, you know what I mean?  Yeah, I think I know what you mean.  Yeah.  There you go, guys.  Thanks.  And let me ask you something.  How long you know this kid, Roger, that was in with Mike?  Oh, a couple of years, ever since he started to come in the shop. 
[00:19:00]  A couple of years.  Now, you're a man of the world.  Now, you must know that this kid is kind of a lot of time, right?  A lot of time.  Is that what Mike thinks of Roger?  Oh, forget about what Mike thinks.  I can't even tell you what he thinks.  Hey, put them glasses over here.  I want to go with you once more.  Go ahead.  Yeah, that's all right.  Come on, let me get you one more time.  Come on, get it up your head.  All right, go.  What does Mike think, Archie?  Oh, Mike, geez.  Well, for one thing, he thinks that friend of his, Roger, is straight. 
[00:19:30]  And for another thing, oh, Steve, you're going to want to bust him wide open when I tell you this.  I don't know where he gets these brain stomps.  But he thinks that you're the...  I can't even say it.  Hey, Steve.  He's right, Archie.  Oh.  While he's holding his hand?  Yeah.  He's right.  Oh, what do you mean he's right about his friend, Roger?  About everything. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, come on.  You want a joke about it, all right.  But come on, get off it, huh, guy?  Archie.  How long you know me?  10, 12 years?  Yeah.  In all that time, did I ever mention a woman?  Oh, boy.  Well, what difference does that make you a bachelor?  So?  A bachelor.  A bachelor.  I know, the bachelors, they're always acting kind of private. 
[00:20:30]  Exactly.  Oh, but fucking...  The ass, he's fucking penetrated.  Hey, I ain't the brightest guy in the world.  You want to put me on, put me on, but don't sit there and tell me that you...  I mean, look at you and look at...  Come on, will you, big clown?  Get out of here.  Have it your own way, Archie.  The truth in the eye of the beholder, anyway.  He looks gay now.  I'll see you later, pal.  Yeah.  I'm just going to go get some ass. 
[00:21:00]  I'll take it.  The other bar down the street.  Well, if that's the punch of a fruit.  Fruit.  There we go.  That's a...  Not a bad scene, right?  Yeah.  What a great show.  He's right, Arch.  He's right, Arch.  Can I suck your cock?  Anyway.  There you have it. 
[00:21:30]  Let's say hi to Nick in Niagara Falls.  Nick.  Yep.  Peckers.  Hey.  Peckers.  Yeah.  What's up, Nick?  All right.  Peckers.  Oh, I didn't hear what you said.  I think he was doing a chip.  Peckers.  Peckers.  That was wonderful.  Thanks.  Good call, Nick.  Thank you.  Very good call right there.  Amazing call.  Trying to talk about Macklemore and how he once tweeted that he tipped a black waitress  21% or... 
[00:22:00]  Are you kidding me?  Come on.  Or that's what the guy said so he could say Peckers.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I don't know what's right.  All right.  Let's say hi to AJ in Brooklyn.  AJ.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  Get us back on track.  Jesus.  Let's go.  If you guys want to hear the most pathetic shit you'll ever hear, look up the song by Macklemore  called White Privilege.  Oh, yeah?  White Privilege.  He apologizes for being a white rapper.  Oh, my God.  I think we might have done this before.  Is he groveling?  He is pathetic, this guy. 
[00:22:30]  He's so groveling.  Just fucking being an artist.  Just don't fucking...  Nothing...  Race matters so much more to liberals.  Oh, another commercial?  Yeah, I see that.  What is that?  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, might be another Mark Cuban commercial.  Right.  For free listening.  Oh, see?  Free listening is back on through February 10th.  Just hit the satellite button in your car and make sure to call this number for a great  subscription offer. 
[00:23:00]  Why is he hiding?  I don't know.  He's hiding from...  Why isn't he fired for doing that?  If you're talking to the camera, you shouldn't hide.  It's stupid.  Right.  They would have locked up that button, too, that you hit to just make it free.  Why have a button that makes it free to listen?  Nothing against Mark Goodman, but it's a horrible concept.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  It's a horrible concept.  No one is, like, sneaking around talking to a camera.  He's behind little fucking, like, road cases and... 
[00:23:30]  And then what?  He assumes the bosses aren't going to know that he was sneaking around talking to a camera?  No, they're not going to see that.  It's not going to get back to them in this day and age?  Wouldn't they have called him into the office and fired him?  Right.  The concept is just...  Is this White Privilege by Macklemore?  All right.  All right.  Oh, is this annoying? 
[00:24:00]  I see so many people lost who really try to pretend.  But am I just another white boy who's caught on to the trend?  When I take a step to the mic, is hip-hop closer to the end?  Because when I go to shows, the majority have white skin.  They marketed the windmill, the air flare, and head spin.  And white rappers' albums really get the most spins.  The face of hip-hop has changed a lot since Eminem.  And if he's taking away black artists' profits, I look just like him.  Claim the culture that wasn't mine, the way of the American. 
[00:24:30]  Hip-hop is gentrified and where will all the people live?  It's like the Central District Beacon Hill to the South End.  Being pushed further away because of what white people did now.  Where's my place in the music that's been taken by my race?  Cultural, appropriated by the white face.  And we don't want to admit that this is existing.  So scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege.  Because it's human nature, I want to be part of something different.  Especially when your ancestors are European Christians.  And most whites don't want to acknowledge this is occurring. 
[00:25:00]  Because we got the best deal, the music without the burden.  Of being black and the system that really wants you out.  Because all you need is a program and you can go and make hip-hop.  And we hate the mainstream.  Because we're the ones that took it.  Now we listen to A-SOP rock and wear t-shirts that say Brooklyn.  But it's not about black and white, right?  I mean, good music is good music regardless of what you look like.  But when you don't give them props, isn't that selfish?  That's like say a rock was actually started by Elvis.  So where does this leave me?  I feel like I pay dues, but I'll always be a white MC. 
[00:25:30]  I give everything I have when I ride around.  But that doesn't change the fact that this culture's not mine.  But I'm going to be me, so please be who you are.  This is something that's effortless and it shouldn't be hard.  I said I'm going to be me, so please be who you are.  We still own 40 acres, now we've stolen their 16 bars.  Hip-hop started off in a block that I've never been to.  To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through.  If I think I understand, it's because I flow too.  That means I'm not keeping it true.  Nope.  Hip-hop started off in a block that I've never been to. 
[00:26:00]  To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through.  If I think I understand, it's because I flow too.  That means I'm not keeping it true.  I'm not keeping it true.  I don't rap about guns.  So they'll label me cautious.  But I don't rap about guns because I wasn't forced into the projects.  See, I was put in a position where I could choose my options.  Blessed with the privilege that my parents could send me to college.  Now, who's going to show us?  The kids on the block starving.  Or the white people with dough that can relate to my content.  Marketed the music and now adapted to the lifestyle. 
[00:26:30]  What happened in jazz and rock and roll is happening right now.  Where is my place in the music that's been taken by the media?  With white corporations controlling what they're feeding you.  I brought up Aesop rock, but I'm not even dissing dude.  We love hip-hop.  And what do you think the Caucasians are listening to?  And I speak freely when I write this.  For black MCA examined race, they both have their fan base.  White kids.  And this is so true.  And we didn't even have to fight the system.  We just went and picked up the microphone too.  And we got good at it.  So we should be rapping.  But only supporting them is like burning Jimmy and buying Clapton. 
[00:27:00]  Now, Clapton's incredible, but no Jimmy, no foundation.  So here comes history and the cultural appropriation.  White kids with do-rags trying to practice their accents from the suburbs.  They're fucking...  A class master of the language.  But hip-hop...  It's embarrassing.  And it's exhausting to listen to.  Yes, yes, yes.  It's just exhausting.  And he's an Eminem rip-off.  He raps like Eminem.  Of course.  He's not even that good.  No Clapton without Jimi Hendrix, I guess, is what he was...  No Clapton without Jimi Hendrix.  It's just like...  Yeah, yeah.  All white people. 
[00:27:30]  What are you talking about?  All white people just stink and suck and fucking...  No Clapton without Jimi Hendrix.  I think they came up together.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I think there's a possibility that Clapton actually hit before Jimi Hendrix.  Yeah.  You think Clapton started playing guitar when he heard Hendrix?  Hendrix died in 1970.  Yeah.  And Clapton was hanging out with the Beatles.  So what are you talking about?  Yeah, he's a dope.  He is a fucking...  What a groveling fucking guilt-ridden...  Just bend over and let a black guy shove a big dick in your ass as reparations. 
[00:28:00]  But that's like an embarrassing desire for black guys to go,  Yo, man, you got it right.  That's not respecting black people, being a groveling fucking phony.  It's like a prison trustee.  It's like a prison trustee mentality.  What's up with this white privilege thing?  What is it?  What?  It's another...  He's so just phony.  I have a lot of people around me that are struggling, and they are white.  Yeah, a white privilege.  What's this white privilege thing where everything's just handed to us?  It's just handed to you. 
[00:28:30]  What are you talking about?  You don't have to do anything.  It's amazing.  Well, I miss that fucking boat.  That would have been a nice boat to jump on.  It would have been great.  Come aboard.  The white privilege is about to leave.  Back in the day.  Imagine?  When I was fucking...  I remember being in a gas station in the middle of the winter because I was sleeping in my car,  and I couldn't run the car because I didn't have much gas in the car, and I would take  the hand blower and put it down my shirt just to get heat.  Right.  And that...  Well, that was your white privilege.  That was my white privilege was the fact that there was a hand blower in the gas station 
[00:29:00]  bathroom.  When I worked at the Walt Whitman...  Give me a break.  When I worked at the Walt Whitman Mall restaurant as a temp to hire, my boss was...  I'm not even...  I swear to you, was a retard.  I was thinking to myself, man, this is white privilege at its best.  White privilege.  It's great.  As I'm washing someone else's fucking dirty dishes.  It's fucking...  Just washing and washing.  And, you know, he didn't live through all that struggle and the culture, so him rapping 
[00:29:30]  about it, he's got to apologize for that.  What about all the other white Macklemore's that aren't making it?  Right.  They should be making it because they got the white privilege on their side too, right?  Yeah.  And what about the fact that black people and non-Caucasian people get to enjoy everything  that white people came up with?  So, are people apologizing that they're using fucking space technology and shit that was  pretty much the majority of the people that did it were white people?  Jesus Christ. 
[00:30:00]  We might have some more info on the Clapton Hendricks thing.  I'm telling you, I think Clapton came way before Hendricks.  Because when you read about the Beatles, man, Clapton was in there and I think Clapton was  trying to become a Beatle even.  He's like, fuck, those guys are onto something.  I want to be part of that shit.  And even if he came a year or two before him, what do you think?  Like, Clapton, who I hate, didn't pick up a guitar until he heard Hendricks?  Yeah, yeah.  He was already good.  Greg in Boston.  What's up, Greg?  What do you say, boys?  First of all, that song was awful.  Awful.  Well, it's awful as a song too because it's just tiring. 
[00:30:30]  It's hard to follow along with it.  And there's no fucking hook.  And we started, Clapton actually found Hendricks, brought him over to Europe, made him big in  England, and then brought him back to the States.  That was, by the way, after laying guitar tracks down for George Harrison because he couldn't  play the guitar either.  So, you're saying Clapton discovered Hendricks?  Clapton, look, it's in the history books.  Clapton just saw Hendricks playing at a little bar, brought him over to England actually, realizing 
[00:31:00]  that a black guitar player at the time wasn't going to really be a big hit, got him big in  England and then brought him back to the States.  And now people are saying Hendricks' hero was Bob Dylan, another guy saying that Clapton  discovered Hendricks and came before Hendricks.  Just more babble, more mackle, more babble.  So he's rewriting history for his stupid fucking song.  Dumb fucking guilt song.  He just stinks his ass.  Shut up. 
[00:31:30]  Don't be guilty somewhere else.  I see.  We'll have you back, Jimmy.  We miss you.  Thank you, sir.  I see right through him.  Right through him.  It's all bullshit.  It's all marketing bullshit.  He must love when fucking black people come up to him and they're like, man, you're keeping  it real.  Right.  Yeah, I am.  Let's say hi to Drew in Connecticut.  Drew.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, buddy.  What did you draw?  I'm just saying, I'm a black guy and listening to that song, that was disgusting.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  It's songs like that that make society more racially divisive.  Of course.  A lot of black folks, to be totally honest with you, have this angst against white America  and songs like that, definitely perpetrated.  No.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Perpetrated.  And then he doesn't even have his facts right in the song.  He's just making up shit because it works for his dopey song.  Well, I mean, you know.  He's no Eminem.  I mean, Eminem's lyrics are pretty solid.  But he sounds like he's trying to sound like him. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, he does.  He's awful.  Yeah.  He's fucking stuck.  He does.  He has good choruses.  I don't know if he sucks.  He won a lot of Grammys.  So a lot of people are buying into his shit.  So two robot heads.  Yeah.  Fuck Macklemore.  All right.  We need a black man in studio to discuss this.  Oh, yes.  Well, there's one I can think coming in.  Dr. Ian Smith doesn't know shit about Macklemore.  Are you kidding me?  I don't know.  He knows about his tread diet, as Bolin says. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, his tread diet.  That's treading, treading.  He don't know shit about Macklemore.  He went to Harvard.  Come on, talk about white privilege.  Dr. Ian Smith has white privilege.  He's a nerd.  Oh, my God.  He's way nerdier than any of us.  Does he know about his blenders?  On their last soldering, are they putting the buttons on it?  Well, they better because the Nutra-Villa people are a knock it at this point.  They're knock it.  He better have that blender today.  By the way, Roland hasn't eaten one kernel of the popcorn. 
[00:33:30]  What?  That he was complaining about not having.  What?  Yeah, Roland's been talking a little shit since the Dr. Ian Smith thing.  So I want to see how it plays out today.  Okay.  Because then Dr. Ian Smith said, all right, I'll get you the fucking popcorn.  So I guess there's a huge box of popcorn somewhere.  Where is that shit?  Because I want to bring some of that home.  Or you guys eat it all.  No.  You want me to bring it in?  Yeah.  And Roland said, I'm not eating this?  Roland, I don't know if he'll tell you.  Roland's doing somebody else's diet.  No, I know that.  Oh, man. 
[00:34:00]  But is he brave enough to say all this today?  I don't know.  I combine these two.  I combine these two.  When we last left you with this whole thing, Roland and E-Rock folded big time.  They had a lot to say about Dr. Ian Smith.  Dr. Ian Smith comes in, and they both folded drastically.  You don't think they stood tall?  Not at all.  And then Roland went back to sort of trashing them, and he's actually following another diet.  But is he brave enough to say that today?  Because that could be fun.  Yeah.  Because Dr. Ian Smith sent a whole box of that popcorn.  Dr. Ian Smith shuts them guys down so fast and easily. 
[00:34:30]  We'll see how it plays out.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Jim should respect Macklemore.  He's a recovering drug addict and alcohol.  So?  Yeah.  I don't want to see the guy drink and hang himself.  I just don't like...  And I said his choruses are very good.  I just don't like that groveling...  I don't find it to be genuine.  No.  Groveling.  If you're good at what you do and you have good musical talent, you don't need to apologize  for that.  Just do it.  You're fucking apologizing. 
[00:35:00]  Well, this is all because of the text message he sent to...  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  You know.  No humility in this.  Again, you know, if there were other white guys in the category, would he have apologized  to them, too?  I mean, he's so...  It's such a gimmick.  Phony.  The tolerance thing?  Yeah.  And I'm not worthy?  His tolerance and acceptance.  Whoa.  Wow, that's all the popcorn?  Three giant boxes.  It looks like no one has really eaten the popcorn. 
[00:35:30]  What happened?  This is healthy popcorn, Jimmy.  No, no.  I'm mad at myself.  I had a big dessert.  What did you have?  It was a bunch of stuff.  A bunch of bites.  We bumped into Dana White in the lobby of the hotel.  It was completely random.  And he goes, let's go to dinner.  Nice.  I had a nice, healthy dinner.  Nothing.  And then he goes, I'm going to get desserts.  And he ordered desserts for the table.  Oh, boy.  I just picked a little butter cake.  Oh, no.  You ever have butter cake?  I've never had it.  It's good.  It's not like pound cake?  Dude, it was like fucking. 
[00:36:00]  It's butter and sugar, basically.  Oh.  I've never had anything better.  I had a little couple bites, but it was good.  I took a 40-pound shit the next day.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  The caller's full of shit is coming in.  What?  It's impossible.  Let's say hi to Larry in Kentucky.  Larry.  Hi, boys.  Hey, Sammy.  Yeah, hello.  All right.  So why is Macklemore full of shit?  Well, the caller's full of shit because Eric Clapton did not discover Jimi Hendrix.  Jimi Hendrix, after he was discharged from the Army, was playing on the Chitlin circuit 
[00:36:30]  with a bunch of groups.  He played with the Isley Brothers.  And he was out doing the Isley Brothers and embarrassing them on stage with his antics  as well as his chops.  So he was in Greenwich Village playing with a group he formed called Jimi James and the  Blue Flames when he was discovered by Chaz Chandler, who was Eric Burden's bass player  in the Animals.  And Chaz Chandler brought him to England, got him a work permit so he could actually play,  which was a big contention because he had trouble getting him a work permit so he could 
[00:37:00]  play and do concerts, hooked him up with Mitch Mitchell on drums, Noel Redding on bass,  forming the Jimi Hendrix experience.  And Clapton had already been playing with John Mayall and the Blues Breakers, and they  were already saying in London Clapton was God because they'd never heard guitar playing.  He was so immersed in American blues.  And so they were really contemporaries.  They were not.  Although Clapton was a star before Hendrix got to Europe, but Clapton's star rose very quickly 
[00:37:30]  in England, and then he had to be imported into America from England to become a star.  Are you reading the Wikipedia page?  No, sir.  I don't have any web access.  I don't have an account.  I'm sitting in a truck.  It's just, I don't.  Holy shit.  This guy knows stuff.  It's Larry.  It's Larry.  I don't give a fuck who he is.  On our show, he's just a fucking dopey truck driver.  He can be Larry on the after show all he wants.  Wow, Larry, you got some knowledge.  Well, yeah, sure. 
[00:38:00]  I read all the album liner notes on all the music that I buy.  I buy physical media and keep it.  I don't even have an MP3 player.  Why?  You sound proud of the fact that you're staying off the grid?  You're not buying into this new technology thing?  Yeah, it's a fad.  Well, the government is watching us.  If you play Angry Birds, they know everything about you according to the media today.  There's some security leaks in that Angry Birds program.  They got all your shit if you played Angry Birds ever.  So have fun with that knowledge.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Larry. 
[00:38:30]  Thank you.  So now I don't know what to think.  Larry seems a bit knowledgeable.  I still don't think Clapton was, you know.  Clapton didn't come before Hendrix.  Stealing shit from Hendrix.  Clapton had his own fucking thing going on.  Yeah, and he was already playing, though.  But to say that without Hendrix, it would have been Clapton.  It's dumb.  And I would have Clapton was fucking fall into a ditch.  Right.  Well, Clapton was already an established star in England, and they were already writing  all over on walls. 
[00:39:00]  So how's the caller wrong, then?  He didn't like the discovery of Hendrix by Clapton.  That's what the caller was wrong about.  Larry is saying that he didn't discover it.  Larry.  But certainly.  Mother Larry.  Certainly Clapton definitely came before Hendrix.  That's the whole point we're making today.  Macklemore says it the other way in his song.  Macklemore.  And no one's going to fucking check him on that.  No.  They're just going to assume it's right because Macklemore wrote it.  Better check yourself.  Right.  But Macklemore doesn't even, you know, know history of music. 
[00:39:30]  I like him, though.  Thank you, Larry.  I like his views.  All right.  Clapton started playing guitar in 63, way before Hendrix.  Yeah.  He was hanging with the Beatles, more or less.  They were in the same circles.  Hmm.  All right.  This guy's an idiot.  Clapton did find him.  Oh, my God.  I'm not going to fucking.  You want to do this?  Yes.  It's Eric from London.  Greg in Boston.  Greg.  Greg.  Greg. 
[00:40:00]  All right.  There you go.  Now we're done.  The story was the same when the guy, he brought him over England and everything.  Don't worry about it.  Clapton found him playing.  Calm down.  He's yelling.  All right.  You're panicking.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  That's all I heard.  And when we get back, Dr. Ian Smith will join the program to check on A-Rock and Roland and  how their weight loss has gone.  Oh, yeah.  I think there's going to be a weigh-in today, too.  Right?  Excited.  And maybe some controversy.  We'll see if Roland's feeling it. 
[00:40:30]  We'll see what happens.  What do you think?  I hope.  I hope.  You think they fold again?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you think so?  Absolutely.  I think Eric has bought in, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I think Roland is the one who's really folding a lot.  Really?  Is he here?  Yeah, Roland just fucking folds right up.  Yeah.  But Roland's here.  Oh, yeah.  You have to stay behind the scenes.  Well, I have no problem telling Dr. Ian Smith that he's following another diet plan.  Yeah.  I have no problem doing that.  Oh, we'll sell him out.  Oh, absolutely. 
[00:41:00]  Coming through their 20-year history, this is an Opie and Anthony radio gem.  It's Justine Jolie.  Hey, could E-Rock spank you?  He's really good at it.  All right.  All right, E-Rock, get up.  Uh-huh.  Do we have the last time he spanked you?  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  Oh, gosh.  Just so...  Give me a little love first.  Don't just start with the whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, E-Rock.  Give me a little love.  Give me a little rug.  Don't just go whack.  Yeah.  Look how... 
[00:41:30]  Notice how Jimmy did it when he would do that years ago.  Yeah.  Many, many years ago.  Yeah.  Before he got a girlfriend.  Yeah.  He would spank girls on it.  A real long time ago.  And he would know how to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you like discipline?  I'm not really good with discipline, which is really crappy.  I can only handle discipline for a little while.  Yeah.  I just like to be roughed on.  Uh, E-Rock, you ready to go or what?  Sure.  Am I getting spanked? 
[00:42:00]  Please, please, please.  How do you want it?  Ooh, there we go.  How about right there?  All right.  E-Rock, uh...  Wait, E-Rock, you got to give her some loving first.  You know how this is going.  Right?  You need some...  It's just, you can't go for the whole, like, crack.  You got to give a little rub.  See, there you go.  Now, a little, uh...  E-Rock is kind of just...  I'm saying.  Rubbing her hiney in such an unsexy way.  It's not going to bite, man.  I promise.  Here goes E-Rock.  Jeez. 
[00:42:30]  He won't disappoint her.  Yeah?  Now, E-Rock knows.  Yeah.  He knows.  All right, there she goes.  All right, just a little rubbing going on.  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Oh!  Mother fucker!  Mother fuck you!  E-Rock!  You cocksucker!  Son of a bitch!  E-Rock!  Ow!  Holy shit!  That feels a fucking bruise, mate!  Look!  Are you shitting me?  She's fair-skinned, too. 
[00:43:00]  You don't...  Oh, my God!  Son of a bitch!  Do you know how to fucking spank a girl?  You douchebag!  Dude, you're supposed to tap!  Ow!  It's not like you're beating women up!  Fuck not!  Ooh!  You don't...  See, here I was all thinking, and he got cracked, too.  You should say no to crack, man!  Holy shit!  Didn't even get the whole ass cheek.  Went for the fucking crotch, too!  I think...  Son of a bitch!  And now, Jim Norton interviews legendary actor, Alan Alda. 
[00:43:30]  Sorry, Alan, I just cut a gaster in your face.  Thank you!  Oh, boy!  Listen to that.  So, let's get to the meat of the issue.  You had AIDS.  How long did you have AIDS for?  I think about six months.  I was really lucky.  I must have had a light case.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Alan, you were a bit of a disappointment.  Thank you very much.  That's my story.  Say what?  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on Sirius XM. 
[00:44:00]  Got Dr. Ian Smith outside the studio, making his way in to check on the boys.  He certainly is.  I don't know why you deal with this radio show, Dr. Ian Smith.  You're a big TV star.  What is it about this show?  Well, you know, I was looking at the...  I was looking at your wall of fame in the office. 
[00:44:30]  Yes.  It's pretty impressive.  Yeah, I date way back.  I was going to give you a hard time, by the way.  Why?  I was going to say that the only black guys on the wall are athletes.  And then I saw myself, and I saw Michael Clarke Duncan, so I backed down.  Patrice O'Neill.  Not athletic.  Not very, no.  He was not.  We had Don Cheadle in studio.  Don Cheadle, a fine actor.  We had...  Terrence Howard.  Terrence Howard.  Terrence.  No, you guys...  We had...  Bogdob.  What's his name?  Marion Barry.  Marion Barry.  Chris Rock.  In the studio?  Yes. 
[00:45:00]  Well, at the doorway.  We kind of hijacked someone else.  But he was still on our show, all right?  Officially.  Was he sober, or was he in one of those states?  He, uh...  Yeah, he was all right.  He was all right?  Yeah, we only got to talk to him for a couple minutes, but it was kind of cool.  Yeah.  Marion Barry.  Anyway, so I stand self-corrected.  You guys have a great wall of fame.  Yes, we just try to keep it really white on the wall.  Yes, of course.  Flav, yet Flav?  Oh, God, yeah.  Flav.  Who spelled guys G-U-Y-E-S? 
[00:45:30]  Was he on that show when you were on it?  He was not.  He was...  No, he was...  I'm trying to remember.  Oh, he was doing his own reality shows.  Yeah, he did that.  Of course he wouldn't do Fit Club.  He was a toothpick.  I was going to say, like, two pounds.  Right, exactly.  So, Ice-T, Ice Cube, what's his name?  The RZA from...  Oh, yeah.  50 Cent?  50 Cent.  50?  50?  Motherfucking 50.  And, you know, we got the Black Channel right next to us, so it's tough to get the  Black guys sometimes.  No, it's not Sway in the morning.  Sway's cool.  Yeah.  We like Sway.  We don't want to hijack their guests, though. 
[00:46:00]  They kind of walk...  They don't really walk past the door.  Right.  Which, if they did, it would just be, hey, get in here.  I'm going to tell you something.  Guys would come all the time.  If you guys...  Yeah.  If they knew you guys were available, guys would come all the time.  Yeah.  I got a guy...  Let me start off before we get into this, because we're going to get into some stuff.  Hold on, hold on.  Meatloaf's going on Fox today.  He babbled yesterday.  He does love me all the time, though.  He's a good guy, though.  What the hell?  Sorry, go ahead.  There's a guy, Manny Kalzinski, who's probably listening or listening to the podcast.  Manny, what's up?  He's in Wichita. 
[00:46:30]  Wichita.  Kansas.  Way out in Wichita.  So, Manny, what's up?  My nose cold out there.  And...  Manny, it's Sal.  Right.  I love Manny.  Manny.  I love him.  I'm married just yesterday.  Sorry.  Manny's just a good old Midwestern white boy.  Nice guy.  Yeah.  It's all the earth.  And then Kathleen and Dan Platt, who just had their baby, in Chicago.  Dan's probably listening.  He's a big fan of you guys.  Like when I used to do you guys a long time ago, he knew me...  Nice.  ...before I met him and his wife. 
[00:47:00]  He knew me from O&A.  From this show, yeah.  Yeah.  So, you guys are huge.  You crazy?  Oh, we try.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, we got your popcorn.  Okay, you got the popcorn.  Oh, look it.  You got three freaking...  No one even...  Now you overdid it.  Oh, no, no, no.  Hold on for a second.  Hold on for a second.  Now you overdid it with the popcorn.  You overdid it.  You guys, I sent you guys...  Look, there's three massive boxes.  Yeah.  It's Shred Pop.  I sent you the flavors.  Right.  And only like two bags have been eaten.  And I just ate one.  Well...  And you just ate one.  You just ate one.  That's why...  And they trashed me.  That you guys trashed me.  Wait, do you remember when I said a mere few minutes ago, why are you dealing with this 
[00:47:30]  show?  Right, right.  We're about to get into it.  Yeah.  Roland has decided he's not going to eat your popcorn.  Roland, for some reason, has decided to completely go off book.  And not even...  This was supposed to be a competition between E-Rock and Roland.  Right.  Using your diet, your super shred, and your money, and see who would lose the largest  percentage of weight, and that's it.  Well, it's taken this turn into bizarro world, where now Roland is on a completely different 
[00:48:00]  diet.  But I don't know if he's brave enough to tell you that, because last time he folded in  front of you.  No, last time he was like, hey, I combined the two.  Right.  Combine the two?  You can't combine diets.  You can't.  It was out of his mind.  How great would that be, the combined diet?  Oh, it'd be great.  And then you'll lose weight twice as fast.  I think that's his thought process.  Just combine the two of diets twice as fast.  Just combine the...  The combo diets.  The desserts.  The good parts of all.  Right, right.  Before I start getting all these nasty tweets, okay, my Twitter, by the way, is Dr. Ian Smith. 
[00:48:30]  Man, so before you start tweeting me, O&A fans, all nasty stuff, I come here in love and peace.  Of course.  So I don't come with an attitude.  I'm trying to help these guys lose weight.  I'm super shred.  A lot of you guys are taking the challenge at home.  Now, that all being said, let's get down to the dirty.  Can I point out why Dr. Ian Smith is the master of promotion?  Yeah.  Because he said, listen, if you're going to trash me on Dr. Ian Smith at Twitter.com,  and look, if you want to bash the shred diet at Shred.com, that's up to you. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, that was very, very smooth.  Oh, that's beautiful.  As a plug whore myself, I bow.  This is good.  Why don't we start with this?  Roland, why aren't you eating the popcorn that you bitched about that wasn't sent pronto?  Because I hear corn is bad for you.  Dr. Oz and Vinnie Turner said corn.  What?  They go, we feed pigs corn.  They get fat, so don't eat corn.  So I was like, oh, no corn.  They also don't exercise. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, they're pigs.  Popcorn is a whole grain.  That means all of the kernel is in existence.  And he said grains are bad for you, too.  What?  They said grains are bad.  But you can't live without grains.  What are you talking about?  And first of all, if that's the case, why do you bash me on the radio in front of all these people when you say you didn't send the popcorn or the blender?  I told you, first of all, the blender is not out yet.  Where are we at?  Where are we at with the blenders?  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's going to be on air this week, this weekend. 
[00:50:00]  But then I tell my guys, send these guys.  In an episode of How It's Made.  DIY.  But then I said to my guys, listen, send O&A the Shred Pop popcorn.  These guys want it.  Don't make me look bad.  I come in and I got boxes stacked like the freaking Eiffel Tower.  I enjoy free things a lot.  But when did this come?  The day we said he was a poop ahead. 
[00:50:30]  What day was that?  Friday?  Thursday?  Thursday?  So why didn't you take some home with you so you have it?  It's a good snack.  And use it.  Dr. Ian Smith, I'll be bringing a lot of that home.  It's good.  I wish I would just give it some of the fans.  Sea salt's good, right?  I just had a kettle one, but it tastes exactly like kettle popcorn.  100 calories for the whole thing.  I will.  Is it really only 100 calories?  100 calories per bag.  Non-GMO corn, Roland.  Non-GMO corn.  What does that mean?  Shit.  Non-genetically modified. 
[00:51:00]  That's dangerous.  That's dangerous?  That's dangerous.  I don't know.  He thinks GMO is the life-building force.  Non-GMO kills you.  Like the GTO.  Oh, that's what you're thinking.  The GTO.  Oh, that was a good part.  So anyway, the popcorn's great.  I should have given it to the people at home who really wanted it.  I could have sent a case to people.  So what's the deal, Roland?  I mean, come on.  Stop all this nonsense.  We're busy.  The show's busy today.  What is going on? 
[00:51:30]  You are the plan on Super Shred or not?  Yes or no?  I don't want any man or answer.  No.  Oh, shit.  I'm on Vinnie Tortorich Fitness Confidential.  What the hell?  Why are you?  It's Bob Kelly's diet.  Yeah, Bob Kelly sent me the audio book, so it was easier to listen to.  What does this diet consist of?  Holy shit.  No corn, I'll tell you that much.  That is correct.  That's right.  No corn, what else?  No corn, no sugar.  Okay.  Uh, like, no, like, we got, but like, not, like, uh, breads and, uh... 
[00:52:00]  Are you allowed to eat ice cream or no?  Uh, sugar.  No, no, I have lactose, so I don't eat ice cream.  Are you allowed to eat?  Oh, boy.  You have lactose intolerance, you mean?  Yeah.  Right.  You don't have lactose.  I have lactose.  Yeah.  Okay, but Roland...  I didn't, I didn't do the medical care.  Okay.  The GMO deficiency.  Good.  Okay, fine.  Well, you know what?  If you want to go on this program where you got to eat like a freaking rabbit, eat like  a rabbit.  Much, much.  No, you can eat steak, you can eat, uh, turkey, you can eat a lot of good things.  They're delicious.  I had steak. 
[00:52:30]  I had, uh...  I'm flapper-gasted here.  Like I said, why does Dr. Smith do our show?  I know.  Why would you do this?  Buffalo chicken.  All right, Roland.  Yeah, I don't like diets like that.  I don't trust a man where you can eat almost like, where you can eat too good buffalo chicken.  No diet should let you eat buffalo chicken.  Oh, no, but it was baked.  Oh.  It was baked.  It was just a chicken with a buffalo sauce on top.  With the skin on or off?  Oh, no skin.  Oh, okay.  Smart.  All right.  A salad with oil and vinegar.  A lot of calories in that skin, right?  You know what?  Yeah, right.  I know that.  About 40% of it.  Okay, listen.  I don't really care.  You know, if you want to go on the Montchachuga diet, I can care less. 
[00:53:00]  But that being said, you made a conscious decision.  The deal was 500 bucks, whoever lost the most weight, right?  Would you be willing, since you're so confident in your plan, in this Vinny...  I can't even pronounce this thing.  Torturish.  Yeah, okay.  Torturish.  Would you be confident, Vin, and going head-to-head with E-Rock?  Because there are a lot of people on ONA who are Team E-Rock, so hashtag Team E-Rock.  Go head-to-head, and if you lose, you match the 500.  Oh, I can.  I moved.  I'm poor. 
[00:53:30]  That's out the window.  I'll tell you right now.  That shit ain't happening.  Rolling, man.  It's called old-fashioned sack, kid.  Have some sack, man.  I could have a sack, but I have no doledes, muchachos.  I do not love rolling.  I'm paying two rents right now for my new apartment and my old apartment.  Oh, boy.  Two rents.  So right now, I paid in one day 15 grand, so. 
[00:54:00]  But the reason is a lot per day.  15 grand?  Yeah, because for the first, last, second.  First, last.  And then the other ones, movie costs and everything.  Do you get your security deposit back from the other place?  60 days.  Jeez, I've got to work for this show.  Did you tell them when they asked for it that you'll have it for them in 60 days?  I love that.  I did, and she's helped me in your credit reports.  I said, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So, no, I have no $500.  I have pesos.  You're supposed to win.  You gave up his diet within days, because I would assume.  Yeah, I see my bank account. 
[00:54:30]  Those money tricks won't work on me, Chachi.  Oh, wow.  How about what I got?  You get your credit thing taken care of from that?  I have to hire a lawyer to do that, so right now, my money is.  Jeez, he got screwed in that Target credit card scam.  Someone took my identity, so.  My bank account's tighter than an asshole.  Who ever took your identity to the side for him?  It's like, they stole that identity, and they're like, oh, my goodness, I didn't mean to get this guy.  Oh, shit.  So, the other guy's doing the shred down here. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  Okay, you know what?  You know what?  Okay, fine.  Roll on.  I mean, you know what?  E-Rock.  Ah, E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  E-Rock's been sitting here very quietly.  Oh, boy.  He's been making your soups and smoothies.  And, E-Rock, I've got to tell you, before you get on the mic, I've got to tell you something.  I get a lot of tweets every day.  And the common hashtag, no offense, Roland, this is before it was disclosed that you wimped.  The common hashtag is Team E-Rock.  Team E-Rock.  There's a lot of fans out there, man.  Thank you all.  Oh, wow.  What?  This has not been enjoyable in the least. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, shit.  What happened?  I've been doing it, but this is...  Fuck.  You look smaller, too, by the way.  The diet is just fucked up.  Oh, really?  It really is.  And to the point where whatever this diet is now, you're constantly shitting.  Just constantly.  Wow.  Because you're eating real food.  Real food, real fiber.  Real food goes through you, right?  Yeah, it's good.  It's good.  I didn't shit that much, so what is it?  He walks around with meat sweats, trying to force it, you know, to get it going so he 
[00:56:00]  could go take a dump.  Yeah.  I haven't stopped.  I went four times.  Wow.  But that's because you're eating real shit.  Cleaning his system out.  That's what people do.  Since 1030 has been nonstop.  That's a cleanse.  You know, calling like John Wayne.  Yeah.  Fucking getting rid of all that extra meat.  But E-Rock, let's be honest.  Now, even though E-Rock is kind of like, you know, back and forth, he kind of like leaves  me sometimes, but I'm still faithful to the guy.  Wow.  He showed me his stuff in there. 
[00:56:30]  It's pretty good.  He cooked, you cooked the broccoli, white, what did you cook?  The broccoli cheddar soup.  Right.  You had your carrots.  You had your guacamole.  And guacamole I made.  Nice little, real professional.  Portioned out.  Yeah, it was nice.  You're really, you're all in there.  I have a photo up on my Instagram I posted last week of my fridge.  I don't even recognize it.  Oh, man.  I missed my friend.  You missed your friend's fridge.  You know how happy your fridge must be right now?  Oh, man.  A lot lighter.  How many years has it been that you've eaten this well? 
[00:57:00]  Be honest.  Yeah.  10.  When was the last diet?  Oh, wow.  2007.  Are you still drinking that cancer water?  No.  Oh, man.  That's fun.  Additive?  Yeah.  Terrible.  Tasty water.  All chemicals.  Chemicals.  And tomorrow's a month without soda.  Wow.  Wow.  Okay, I give up.  Now, that's called an NSV, a non-scale victory, so I give it up to you.  Yeah, that was difficult because that involved a lot of, like, headaches. 
[00:57:30]  When I stopped that, my head was killing me for, like, three days.  And then all of a sudden it went away and there's no craving for it anymore.  That's great.  So, wait, 28th.  We're two weeks out.  We're two weeks out.  I was here on the 14th.  Was it the 14th?  14th and 15th I was here.  So, we're halfway there.  We're halfway there.  Wow.  We're halfway there.  Where's the scale, guys?  Oh, there we go.  Okay, hold on.  Before you step on the scale, I got the old pictures because I know in this place I got  to have documentation.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone's willing to cheat and lie.  Really?  I got to figure. 
[00:58:00]  My lawyers come with me next time.  Okay.  E-Rock, you stepped on at 247.8.  All right.  Hold on.  Roland, you stepped on.  336?  Well, 3, yep, 336.4.  Good memory, Jim.  Okay, so, go ahead, Roland.  Let me take a picture of this again.  Roland, not using your diet.  Yeah.  Roland's on the scale. 
[00:58:30]  Taking a picture.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh, jeez.  Well, well, well.  Look, he's giving you something.  He's giving you some fucking...  Good old Vinnie Testaverde, whoever he's done here on.  I give the E-Rock the L-D and the A.  So, Roland is down to 320.  Oh.  So, it's all 16 pounds.  320.  Be careful, though, guys.  And I had steak.  What's up?  Roland, be careful.  We did this on Fit Club all the time. 
[00:59:00]  Uh-huh.  You started off at 330, my friend.  336.  Be careful.  So, you're 16.  I will for the barbecue sauce.  What's up?  Okay.  All right.  Come on.  Come on, Team E-Rock.  Here goes E-Rock.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  E-Rock looks thinner.  He does, right?  Yeah, he does.  Shit doll this morning.  It's like five pounds.  E-Rock is shit before Ian got here, right?  Yeah.  That's good.  All right.  All right.  Taking the picture of the scale. 
[00:59:30]  Okay.  Uh-oh.  I can't read Dr. Ian Smith.  No, I can't either.  I can read Dr. Ian Smith.  That was an uncomfortable throat clear.  You don't need to be a master of body language to know what ahem means.  E-Rock is down to 237.  And he started, what's that, 247?  Yes.  He's lost 10.  So, that's 10.  Okay.  That's still good.  The challenge is also based on percentage.  That's what you're ready to do. 
[01:00:00]  That's exactly right.  That's right.  See, now this is an issue here.  Oh, no.  So, I have to protest this.  Wait, wait, wait.  Don't protest.  Dude, stop while you're at it.  I think you're okay.  Just wait.  Okay.  Wait, okay.  Don't protest.  Wait, but I want to know what he was going to say, though.  Because he says silly things.  He didn't know that the math might work out in his favor.  Right.  Aw.  You know percentages?  How do you do that?  I can't do percentages.  I do the old-fashioned way.  Yeah.  You turn it into a decimal.  That's right.  So, 10 equals what percent of 247? 
[01:00:30]  I wouldn't know that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  So, well, there's the-  24.7.  There's the-  Well, there-  Right, right.  There's the-  So, there's the crude way of doing it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So, 10% of 24, uh, 247 is 24.  Yes.  And so, he lost 10 pounds, about half of that.  So, he lost about 5%.  That's the crude way of doing it.  Okay.  Right?  Here, 10% of, uh, 336 is 33.  Yes.  Right?  He lost, um, about 16. 
[01:01:00]  So, he lost that.  So, they're just about neck and neck.  Oh.  Really?  Ooh.  They're neck and neck, right now.  All because, uh, half of, uh, 33 is about 16.5?  Okay, cool.  Yes.  All right.  So, they're about neck and neck right now.  Mm-hmm.  Which is good, by the way.  Mm-hmm.  Two different diets.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, Vinny Testaverde versus the Super Shrek.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Where is Vinny Testaverde?  I'm just crushing this guy today.  Oh, my God.  Um, so, you guys, you're neck and, so, you're neck and neck, by the way. 
[01:01:30]  You're neck and neck, and I have extreme confidence that, in the long run, because, Rowan, you  start off at 336, you're losing a lot of water weight, my friend.  Which is good.  But, the first two weeks, a lot of water weight.  Water weight.  Uh-oh.  Roll and slow.  Of course, of Mr. Vinny Torche, it's not water weight, my friend.  It's my fat weight.  So, I say, no.  What is that?  It's so weird. 
[01:02:00]  Of course, of Vinny's foot size.  I love this.  I really think.  I just can't, I can't get this anywhere else.  No.  I literally don't know the first three letters of Vinny's last name.  Torche or Torche.  Torche.  Torche.  Torche.  Torche.  Torche.  Torche.  Torche.  There's a Vinny out there right now, crying.  Yeah.  I can't get his plug, butchering it, butchering it, butchering the King's English.  I don't know how he knows it.  All right, so what do you guys think?  I mean, wait, what was Iraq going to say? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Before he stopped him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What were you going to say?  What math blunder were you going to make?  It wasn't a, it wasn't based on the numbers, it was based on the fact that this whole thing  started with Ian's diet and Ian's money, as was stated earlier.  But Roland does not follow anything that Ian has put out or his challenge or anything.  Now, if it was a challenge just to lose weight, that's one thing, but this was all based  on Ian's book. 
[01:03:00]  You know, he complained about the popcorn, he complained about the blender, and Ian's  money is up here not to fund, you know, Vinny Testaverde's diet.  And I hate that I'm defending Ian on this, but this is the rule.  And Iraq doesn't even want to defend Ian.  Get the fuck out of here and hasn't, like, he doesn't even know where his book is.  He could just eat, like, a grapefruit every day and starve himself just to win the best.  You're actually trying to do it the right way, where maybe your eating habits change 
[01:03:30]  in the end.  Yeah.  Got it.  All right.  Well, I'm going to address that, because I'm going to be a fair guy, because last time  I was here, live in person, Iraq said that I go on all these big TV shows, and I show  compassion for these guys, and I ban it, so I'm going to, I'm a new Dr. Ian now, okay?  So, here's...  Your audio book off.  I'm sorry, Vinny was talking.  Apologies.  Vinny, don't interrupt Dr. Ian.  Tell Vinny the Jets need him.  Wait, is that actually Vinny?  Yeah.  You're calling him?  No, no, I could, but it's a tortorich. 
[01:04:00]  What is it?  Exactly.  It's an audio book.  It's an audio book.  Oh, my God.  Hey, have you talked to Vinny?  Yes.  It's on iTunes.  It's on iTunes and Amazon.com.  Good to see you.  Let's get him up there, people.  Oh, my God.  Back to you.  Back to you.  So, anyway, so I think, you know, addressing E-Rock's concerns, E-Rock, you make a ballot  point, guys, right?  So, I think, let's morph this a little bit.  Can we?  So, what I'd like to do is, so, E-Rock, you don't have the competition with him anymore 
[01:04:30]  because he's off the super shred, right?  He never started it.  Okay.  I mean, that's correct.  Okay.  So, why don't we do this, E-Rock?  See if this is fair.  I want to do something that you agree with.  Okay.  In my face, if I leave here, you guys are going to talk a bunch of stuff about me.  Do you agree that, do you think you can reach 20 in four weeks?  The book says four weeks, 20 pounds.  Mm-hmm.  Do you think you can reach that?  I think I can reach 20.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  That's right.  Two weeks to go.  All right.  All right.  So, how about this?  He's halfway there.  There you go.  You're halfway there.  You're 10,000.  So, you've got to keep it up. 
[01:05:00]  So, how about we just give you the five bills.  Okay.  If you reach 20.  Whoa.  All right.  And five from Opie too.  And five from Opie too.  That's true.  And one from Dr. Steve.  Wow.  You got in on that?  That's $1,100 for E-Rock.  Who's Dr. Steve?  What?  Who's Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve.  Exactly.  I don't know.  He does weird medicine on our channel.  We don't really know.  He's pissed in $100.  Believe me, no diet plan there unless you consider dwindling geriatric on a bath.  He has stock in a toe tag company.  Yeah.  He's the king of weight loss as a doctor. 
[01:05:30]  Yes, exactly.  He does palliative care.  He's the king.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, he works at a hospice.  He's a ghoul, so he sees a lot of weight loss.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's never sent the same Christmas card two years in a row.  I just want to point out that Sam's a fucking rat, by the way.  Dude, I forgot you were in.  I totally forgot you said that.  You're a rat.  You did sell him out real fast.  That'll bite you.  That'll bite you in the ass eventually. 
[01:06:00]  What a rat.  That'll be.  What a fucking rat.  I forgot, too.  He's here to keep the records.  Keep the records.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair, right?  Listen, guys, I'm going to be honest with you.  I don't really give a flying what Roland does.  I mean, Roland, you are.  Oh, man, Roland.  Roland, you are like.  I will lose more weight than Eric, and I'll prove that his diet is better.  Whoa.  Keep the money.  Oh, fuck.  Keep the money, and I'll prove that he will.  Now you're getting personal.  Yeah.  Now you're making it personal.  This is his bread and butter right there. 
[01:06:30]  E-Rock, we got to go now.  Yo, listen, everyone listening, you got to join Team E-Rock.  Now we're just going to.  Join all you want, but I'll lose more weight.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You're going to lose more.  I'm going to drink your milkshake.  Wait.  You're going to lose more weight because you're 100 pounds more than E-Rock.  So, yeah, you are going to lose more absolute weight, but you will not lose more weight relative  to your body weight.  Oh, man.  I will.  Well, then.  Oh, Roland.  Come on, man.  Put your money where your mouth is.  I don't have the money.  If not, I would put it where my mouth is. 
[01:07:00]  Exactly.  I'm afraid to eat it.  Okay.  Here's the deal.  It's part of the kidney test.  I'm ready to die.  If you lose, you've got to run naked from 48th to 49th up 6th Avenue.  That's right.  Oh, you're arrested.  Tidy-whities then.  Tidy-whities.  Tidy-whities.  Tidy-whities rules.  Yeah, the cowboy does in Times Square, right?  He does.  Absolutely.  I wear short shorts, but not...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Short shorts.  Short shorts.  Short shorts.  If you lose tighty-whities from 48th to 49th Street, make a deal, Roland.  You say, don't have money.  That's something you can do.  I want to go on my underwear. 
[01:07:30]  It's in...  Nobody wants you to.  I wear shorts.  Hey, Dr. Ian Smith, someone did the math and said you might be off a little bit.  Larry in Kentucky.  Larry.  Hey, Larry.  Good morning, folks.  Mr. Ian Smith.  It's very nice to talk with you.  Roland is at 4.76% of body weight.  Okay.  And Eric is at 4.05% of body weight.  He said about 5.  I said about 5.  Just doing it rough.  I didn't use a calculator, did I, guys?  No, it's very crude, as he said on a piece of paper. 
[01:08:00]  That's technically in the lead, is what Larry has to say.  Roland is in the lead by 0.71.  And he's drinking milkshakes.  He wants everyone to know that.  Oh, yeah.  Right, Roland?  There will be blood.  What's up?  Yeah.  What's the call?  There will be blood.  What's up?  Larry.  Hey, Larry.  Larry, thanks for that calculation.  You're right.  Exactly.  I was just doing it rough, okay?  Uh-huh.  According to at least Vinny.  I'm just kind of a prick.  Just ask Opie.  No, I called him a prick a mere 10 minutes ago on something else. 
[01:08:30]  Sorry, Larry.  If you want to know the name of Roland's diet, it's the capital of Chechnya.  That's the guy's last name.  Fucking nine vowels in a row.  Tarshaw.  I still know his last name.  I don't either.  I literally couldn't say the first letter.  I think it's tertiary or tertiary.  Tertiary.  Greg in Philly.  Greg?  How you doing?  You're a Dr. Ian success story.  Yeah.  I really changed a lot of stuff because of him.  I've lost 30 pounds so far, but I'm a very heavy guy. 
[01:09:00]  How heavy are you?  30 pounds in how long?  Well, since it came in.  I think it was the 15th.  Oh, you've lost 30 pounds in two weeks?  That's great.  Yeah.  I stopped drinking and no carbs, and then I'm doing my Andrew term.  That's great.  But why are you downplaying that?  In two weeks, 30 pounds is ridiculous.  He weighs 880 pounds.  Yeah, it might be.  Now, how much do you weigh?  Well, my start weight was 373.  Okay.  343 does.  All right. 
[01:09:30]  And my, you know, I have proof on my Twitter that I just made last night.  It's at Super Shred Me.  Oh, yeah.  I saw your picture, actually.  Thank you.  There it is right there.  There's a guy.  He's lost 30 pounds already.  Yeah.  In two weeks.  That's great.  Yeah, I got your picture up.  You want to run in the underwear in Times Square, sir?  No.  The worst part about going to the gym is my fat tits on the elliptical seat.  No.  Wow. 
[01:10:00]  Nobody minds a fat guy in the gym, though.  Everybody respects a fat guy in the gym.  When you're in the gym and you see a guy who's really gigantic, everybody respects that  guy because he's there.  On his picture that he posted on Twitter, right under his tits, under the one tit, he wrote  slob, and under the other tit, he wrote O.  That's nice.  Slob O.  Yeah, I'm trying.  I'm going to the gym every day and following it and working hard.  That's great.  Jesus, Greg. 
[01:10:30]  Good for you, man.  Good, man.  30 pounds in two weeks.  Keep checking in with us, huh?  All right?  All right.  Good job, buddy.  See what I mean?  This is this guy.  This guy has been killing me.  This Peter guy.  You know, he says, Dr. Ian Smith, you dropped the ball on E-Rock Radio and Roland Spano.  No follow-up.  You stink.  Dude, what planet are you living on?  Seriously.  Like, get from under the cave or the rock.  I just hear you that tweet.  I'm just kidding.  That you live in.  What do you mean I haven't followed up?  You've been paying attention?  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you trying to say there's haters on Twitter?  That's crazy. 
[01:11:00]  What the freak?  Someone told me I should die, so, like, what's up?  Why are you in town, Dr. Ian Smith?  Super Bowl?  I got to do.  That's next week.  With Stray, actually.  You know, Stray may actually, knock on wood, I shouldn't do this, but get into the hall after  they screwed him last year.  Really?  So, he's up for, the way it works, I've never heard, didn't know this, so the way it works  is on Saturday, they call all of the inductees and let them know.  So, we have a dinner scheduled.  I'm going to go to dinner with him and his girl, and hopefully, it's going to be a celebration. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, right, right.  Oh, my God, it might not be.  Oh, it could be either way.  It could be kind of oaky, so.  Are you here all week?  No.  I'm doing Rachel Ray a little later, then I fly to L.A. to do the doctors.  And then I come back on Saturday to hopefully go to a celebration dinner.  I'm doing one Super Bowl party.  That's it.  Direct TV.  By the way, how sexy is Rachel Ray?  She is really sexy in person.  I've only met her once.  Really?  I can't see it.  I couldn't either. 
[01:12:00]  We took a phone number together.  Her vibe was absolutely sexy.  She is.  I could not believe how attracted to her I was.  Really?  Yeah, man.  Okay.  Why don't you guys ever come to the show with me?  We're never invited.  We're not invited to anything.  Jeez.  Next time I come to do Rachel Ray, you guys will come to the show.  When is Rachel Ray today?  What time?  Yeah.  I'm due there at 11 o'clock.  You want to come by today?  Yes.  No one invites anybody.  Seriously, come by today.  No one invites us today.  This show should be called Esteem and Low Selfie.  Right.  Right.  Oh, they're wearing his hat on TV. 
[01:12:30]  Is that fun?  Oh, there you go.  Is that fun for everybody?  Pharrell.  Pharrell's hat from the Grammys.  Everyone's now wearing the hat.  It's terrible.  The hat.  Can I chime in?  I'm kind of way off message.  We'll get back to these guys, but let's just chime in on something.  Yeah, yeah.  This whole thing with Macklemore and apologizing.  I just got to say something.  Were you listening to our show on the way in?  Yeah, a little bit.  Okay.  Yeah.  Why was this guy apologizing?  You won.  I don't know.  You won.  It just seemed kind of like, it almost seemed. 
[01:13:00]  He's trying too hard for an image that is just not there.  Yeah.  Be yourself.  Dude, you won.  Right.  It's fine.  And then the whole thing, like, you know, white guys can't win in rap.  Why can't white guys win in rap?  Yeah.  That's like saying a black guy can't win in rock.  Right.  And we've said that many times.  Yeah.  Like Darius Rucker.  Darius Rucker.  So what?  He can't win because, I mean, I just.  What a horrible example, by the way.  It makes no sense.  You know what I mean?  What a horrible.  He had a good run.  What is he doing now?  Like country or something?  He's a little country.  But my point is, you know, why can't you, what is it?  It's not your race about, it's your music. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  People like your music, they like your music.  And just this whole.  Yeah, leave race out of it.  Just fucking.  This guy on CNN was like going off about how a white guy won the rap.  Hello, have you checked the calendar?  It's 2014.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not 1982 when only black people rap.  And white guys have been fans of rap for many years.  Since way in the old days of rap.  Fucking white guys like this.  Not even that.  They bought more than black people.  They bought more rap than black people.  So I just think that this whole like, what do you.  And you know what? 
[01:14:00]  I'm going to tell you something.  Him apologizing is what makes it bad.  Because.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He makes it go back.  Because now it's like, oh, well, white people shouldn't do rap.  Right.  Dude.  Yeah, it's divisive.  It really is.  It should just.  Just.  Just.  I can play the music.  Don't apologize for it on either side.  And just fucking.  If.  It's.  If I like a song, I don't care.  Right.  Who fucking did it.  Exactly.  What color they are.  What race they are.  It don't matter.  Don't give a fuck.  It's just stupid.  Anyway, that was my little two cents on how stupid is this guy to. 
[01:14:30]  He's trying to.  He's trying to mean something.  That's all.  Right.  I don't think anybody gives a shit.  No one.  It's.  It's groveling and insincere.  He's just embarrassing.  He's embarrassing.  Because it seems forced.  It does.  It does, right?  It doesn't even seem that's.  That's him.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  So what do you guys want to do?  I mean, I guess I'll come back in two weeks.  You guys come to Rachel to meet me there or not?  No.  Today.  I have a training session.  Yeah.  I'm going to the gym.  Look.  And I had my smoothie.  With my new.  New.  My.  Easy.  Your Shred Emulsifier Blender coming. 
[01:15:00]  It's coming soon.  That's it.  Because they're knocking.  These people are knocking on my door, Dr. E.  So don't do it.  Don't do it.  No.  Okay.  Hey, guys.  Pull this up.  Pull this up, Sam.  Where's Sam?  If you want to see the blender.  Hold on.  I've got to apologize.  Because this guy's calling me out.  Well, I'll let him say it before you get out of here.  Go ahead, Kevin.  I did not know this.  Make me look stupid.  Please.  Go.  No.  I'm not trying.  Yeah.  I just.  I was surprised.  But he won.  I think he won some Grammy.  I just was reading in newspapers.  So I just want to let you know.  Who did? 
[01:15:30]  Darius Rucker, I believe.  Oh.  He did?  In all fairness, he did reinvent himself.  And he's doing well in the country world.  I just.  I tapped out.  I used to kind of like some of his stuff back in the day.  Yeah.  No.  I just want to let you know.  It's no big deal.  All right, brother.  Take care, guys.  Bye-bye.  You got it.  All right.  Goodbye, sir.  So this is the blender you guys are getting.  It's a fire.  Right?  Whoa.  The website is TryShred, T-R-Y, Shred.com.  And that's what it looks like.  It's all computerized.  So you don't have to put the timer on it.  If you want a smoothie, it's already programmed time-wise. 
[01:16:00]  Do you have to pour that into another cup to bring with you?  No.  You can take it with you or you can pour it.  If you want it, you know, you can take it.  It has this.  Uh-oh.  It has this like cyclonic activity.  Nice.  Because it makes it like all the stuff feeds down.  It's pretty cool.  It looks cool.  Yeah.  So anyway, you guys are going to get them.  I mean, Roland's not going to get one.  Oh, because of Opie, I'm getting a Nutribullet.  What's up?  For free.  Boom.  Keep your thing.  I got a Ninja.  I got a Nutribullet. 
[01:16:30]  I'm very, very happy.  Thank you.  Why is he so competitive?  I think he didn't like hearing that he got owned last time.  So he's kind of making up for it.  But I accept your invitation to Ray for Ray.  What I got with you?  Oh, shit.  Roland, if you think that I'm going to ruin my career by bringing you down to Ray to Ray  Studios.  Somebody really fast wants to know, is diabetic, how does he cut out all the, he can't cut out  all the carbs.  He can't?  So what can you do for Eric in Iowa? 
[01:17:00]  Remain a fat ass, my friend.  Enjoy.  Eric, you're on with Dr. Ian Smith.  You're the last call because we've got to get him out of here.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Ian, I'm diabetic.  And, you know, I've been trying to listen to what you've been saying.  But fucking serious.  Got the goddamn different show on the fucking headphones.  So I can't understand what's going on.  But I'm diabetic.  I want to know what you can do for me.  I'm 6'1", and I'm 240 pounds.  240?  6'1", 240.  Okay.  Are you a severely diabetic? 
[01:17:30]  Are you on insulin or just pills?  No, I'm type 2, but I run kind of high.  Okay.  So here's the deal.  Have you tried any diet whatsoever?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm on a diet right now.  I eat my carb choices.  I eat about 45 carbs a day or a meal.  Okay.  Have you seen Super Shred?  No, I haven't.  You haven't?  I haven't.  Okay.  I'm going to do something I rarely do.  Okay?  I'm going to...  Do you need some popcorn?  Holy shit, Roland. 
[01:18:00]  Listen to me, guy.  I'm going to actually send you a copy of the book.  All right?  I want you to take a look at the book.  You can make substitutions.  Diabetics, vegans, vegetarians.  Everyone can do this plan because the book is very flexible.  Okay?  What about Blender?  So, Roland, you're a...  Oh, man.  I've got to remember my professionalism here.  Right, right.  Keep it together.  Yeah, I keep it together.  Dude, here's the deal.  Do me a favor.  Send me an email. 
[01:18:30]  Okay?  I'm going to give you my email address.  You ready?  Okay.  Shredder.  It's shredder nation.  S-H-R-E-D-D-E-R nation at gmail.com.  What's your name again?  Eric.  Eric, he said?  Eric.  Okay, Eric.  Make sure you put in the subject line, Eric from O&A Show.  And give me your address.  I'm actually going to have my team send you a copy of Super Shred and the other book, Shred.  I'm going to give you both books.  Okay?  All right.  You're going to get 100 emails. 
[01:19:00]  But that's why I told you to put into the...  Well, I just don't...  Well, I'll figure it out.  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Iowa.  Iowa.  Great.  Ain't going to be a lot of addresses coming in from Iowa.  All right, dudes.  And then I'll send it to you and then we'll talk via email.  And follow me on Twitter at Dr. Ian Smith.  D-R-I-A-N Smith.  All right.  I'm going to go get these dudes to the fucking fatties.  Okay?  Are these referring to those two?  Oh, yeah.  Well, E-Rock's good, man.  Don't go on E-Rock.  E-Rock is good, man.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  And I really like you guys' show, you know, but it really doesn't put nothing into you guys.  Yeah, it's kind of depressing.  What are you going to do?  All right, but you guys are...  Sirius is letting us just rot here, basically.  What do you mean?  We're just rotting.  It's all right.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Exactly.  No real push.  No real promotion.  We've got a solid guy running the channel now, so we'll see what happens.  But in general, we're just rotting.  Here's the problem with you guys.  Sorry, we have all the buzz of Aftermash. 
[01:20:00]  Anybody remember that show?  Hello, Larry.  Exactly.  We're the Hello, Larry in Sirius.  Why don't you guys do...  You guys never do TV.  You guys don't do video.  Oh.  Well, what are you going to do?  TV.  I do Red Eye on Fox.  I try to push the...  I want the guys on TV.  I think you guys belong to me.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Why do you guys do that?  I'm not your agent now, but...  Well, you want to be?  Yeah.  You literally couldn't do worse.  You are our agent. 
[01:20:30]  There's no way to do worse.  Why don't you guys...  Seriously.  Why don't you guys do TV?  You already have a huge following.  They've tried to figure out a TV show for years.  Who's they?  I don't know.  All sorts of production companies.  We've taken a million fucking meetings.  All the crap that's on TV right now?  I know.  Are you in a thousand channels?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Okay.  Are you saying that this show should create an idea and bring it to TV?  Well, thank you, Dr. Smith.  You are correct.  Duh.  They don't really want us doing TV down the hall.  Oh.  As far as the show goes.  So we'd have to do a whole different thing.  That's true.  Which is fine, but... 
[01:21:00]  Hey, Eric, you good with Dr. Ian Smith this time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  $500, I'm great.  Wow.  It's all about money.  So you still don't like him?  He's come around a little bit.  Oh, my God.  The guy's doing nothing but helping you.  Why are you?  And you have this...  I don't know what this is.  Why?  What the fuck?  Jesus.  I've known Dr. Ian Smith for a long time.  We became friends after his first appearance.  I don't really understand this.  I don't either.  He's a nice guy.  I don't get this at all.  You're never coming back, are you, Dr. Ian Smith? 
[01:21:30]  Hey, listen.  You know what?  I'm an eternal optimist.  The guy said he's turning a little bit, so I'll take the little turn and see where that  goes.  I'll see where that goes.  You know what I mean?  But, you know.  And no regrets.  You're saying everything you need to say, or are you going to wait until he leaves, and  then you'll have more to say?  You good?  That is correct.  All right.  Eric's good.  Roland, you good?  All right.  No talking behind his back.  If you have something to say, say it here.  That's Vinny, T-O-R-T-O-R-I-T-H.  And also, the Nutribullet, I'm getting Friday, and I'll let everybody know how it is. 
[01:22:00]  I hear it's fantastic.  So Roland's putting nothing on the line?  No.  No.  Of course not.  He wouldn't agree to the white tighties of 6th Avenue, nothing, nothing.  Well, I have skid marks on my white tighties, sir.  In the front.  From the diet you're on.  Anybody who joins Team Roland after this kind of display of just wussiness.  Join me.  We'll celebrate with Nutribullet and ninjas.  Are you saying misguided belligerents, Roland?  Misguided belligerents. 
[01:22:30]  Unbelievable.  Hey, E-Rock, you and I are going to work out next time I come to town.  All right.  Poor bastard.  Guys, before I go, I got a 27-minute workout that I did.  27 minutes.  That's it.  No machines.  Don't need a gym.  Just need an open space.  Burn more calories than working on a treadmill for an hour.  So what are you going to tell us about it?  Yeah.  I hate going to the gym.  I know a lot of guys do.  27 minutes.  It's called the Shred 27 Burn.  I just shot it.  Is that going to be in a book?  No, it's a DVD.  Oh.  Put that DVD on? 
[01:23:00]  When do we get that?  I got to be careful with what I say here because if I don't do it in the wrong time, I get  trashed.  Oh, man.  I'm pushing a new exercise.  It's where you put on a headband and then you listen to Olivia Newton-John records and  do jumping jacks in the field.  That's my new workout.  These calisthenics.  Yay.  You guys will have the Shred 27 Burn by next Thursday.  Next Thursday.  No.  That's impossible.  All right.  You think it's impossible? 
[01:23:30]  We'll see.  They're still filming it.  No, it's done.  I'm teasing, of course.  He's going to film it on his phone just so it gets here by Thursday.  The website is Shred.  Before I get out of here, thanks to Jim.  Shredlife.  S-H-R-E-D.  Life.com.  That's where the DVD is.  Shredlife.com.  Cool.  Hey, guys.  Good hanging out with you guys.  I'll check it out.  Bye, man.  We'll see you in a couple weeks.  Yeah, no doubt.  Dr. Ian Smith.  Let's get Penn Jillette in here. 
[01:24:00]  Yes.  We've got a very busy day.  Penn Jillette is waiting outside.  Yes.  The inimitable Penn Jillette.  Anything?  Anything?  There he here comes.  Oh, Paul Paul.  Yeah, right.  There's Penn Jillette, everyone.  What's going on, buddy?  It's good to see you guys.  How you doing, Penn?  I got magic questions.  Okay.  I save all my magic questions for when you show up.  Well, I'm flattered.  It's not really magic, though, Opie. 
[01:24:30]  That's what I learned.  No, it's magic.  It's magic.  It's absolutely magic.  All right.  Swindles, rip-offs.  Swindles, rip-offs.  We like to consider ourselves rip-off artistes.  We're okay.  So put the headphones on in case you...  You could, in case there's a call or something.  You don't have to.  It's up to you.  But you sound so much more intimate, Penn.  Yeah, it really does.  That close to the mic thing.  It's like you're whispering in my ear.  What are you thinking?  Hi, Penn.  We're obsessed with Criss Angel these days. 
[01:25:00]  Well, why wouldn't you be?  Fellas like you.  No, don't do that to us.  We think he's a hack.  And I'll tell you why.  Because he's lazy with his presentation.  We all know their illusions, but he's lazy.  Well, first of all...  The steamroller one that he did.  Oh, was that terrible.  That was amazing.  Where he was going, I think it was a half mile an hour, and the steamroller was going over him.  And there was glass and stuff.  Well, steamrollers are not known for their speed.  Thank you.  Don't bust them on that. 
[01:25:30]  Thank you.  The funny car steamrollers.  The top fuel eliminators.  Nitro-powered steamrollers.  They're going seven miles an hour.  But my point, he puts a towel on the side of the steamroller to protect the audience.  Right.  Because he has to obviously cover up what, you know, what...  The shenanigans.  The old switcheroo.  And we're sitting there embarrassed for the guy.  Oh, there it is.  Because, like, no one's buying that a steamroller's going to pop shit into the audience.  Well, the problem is he called it the steamroller manhole trick, and he kind of gave himself away. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I mean, it's...  Well, that's Johnny Thompson.  He works with us.  Johnny's great.  Oh.  Well...  Yeah, I think that's what...  But see, look at the towel on the side.  And he needs that towel so he can do what he, you know...  Well, that's where the shenanigans...  That's where the shenanigans happen.  And every time we see this, we always go back to you, and we go, Penn and Teller would never just have a towel hanging.  They would figure out, okay, we have to modify the steamroller so it looks like that piece has always been there. 
[01:26:30]  Or the fact is, I don't know if you guys noticed this, it's on fucking TV.  Right.  They can do anything.  Right, sure.  Yeah, it's Avatar.  Do whatever you want.  It's not even going a half a mile an hour, but the towel is there for the audience's protection.  You're burying your lead.  The lead is, you've got this genius idea, which is really fast steamrollers.  Never mind Criss Angel, all right?  That would be great.  If there was a show on TV...  Drag racing steamrollers would be great. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, and A's drag steamrollers.  How much would you pay to see a steamroller go 90?  And see a steamroller, like, peel out?  Yeah.  Smoke show with a steamroller, just sparks flying out?  Yeah.  That would be great.  But the towel on the side, because he's got to hide behind that.  Everyone knows.  Weld a piece of steel and paint it the same color as the...  That's what Penn and Teller would do.  They would modify the steamroller.  It looks like...  With maybe some kind of logo.  Like, look, the logo had to be there.  You know, you could do a trick.  You could also do a trick.  But the one that we've really been obsessed with, and it went a little viral for us, I must 
[01:27:30]  say.  Oh, good.  Because we watched the episode and we commented about it, and then we put the video online,  was the shack balloon.  But we're not sure it is actually a balloon.  He levitated shack.  And that's why we have to ask you.  He levitated shack over his house.  And we were convinced they just made a balloon out of shack and put helium in it.  Have you ever heard of these guys doing, making a balloon, an actual balloon of a person?  Or is it just green screen?  Here's our basic problem. 
[01:28:00]  Yes.  Okay.  And I guess we should cut to the absolute chase here.  Yeah, okay.  Nobody that I know personally, outside of this room, has ever watched a moment of a Chris  Angel show.  I mean that.  Actually, you know, you are absolutely blindsided me.  It's like you're saying, you've changed the diet on me.  You know?  It's exactly...  Because, you know, it's not the kind of thing...  I guess what you think, you know, you think is I'm sitting around all the time going, 
[01:28:30]  Teller, Teller, come here.  The new Chris Angel special's on.  Let's watch it.  Maybe we can figure out why he's got a towel there.  It never crosses.  See, I think they're holding down a balloon.  You think that's a balloon of sand?  Because you know, all I'm saying is you know this shit, so I'm trying to...  I just want you to tell us what this is.  On a string?  We think it's a balloon.  Is that Carrot Top that's there?  Yeah, Carrot Top's house.  He's hanging out.  Oh, it's Carrot Top's house.  I think it's real.  You think that's just shit, Shaq? 
[01:29:00]  Watch the balloon.  He gets lazy and he picked the wrong cut because when it goes over the roof, you see the thing  of the wobbles.  I think it just wobbles a little like a...  Yeah, I...  But watch the wobble.  Or is it the crane?  Is it the crane with the cables in the bright sky?  I'm going to tell you, as an expert, I think that's a real magic of it.  It's really Shaq.  I don't think there's any trickery whatsoever.  Why am I asking him?  I knew he wasn't going to answer it.  I think he's going to tell you that I think that a Shaq balloon would accomplish everything 
[01:29:30]  you see there.  It would.  I'm not saying it's the way it's done.  But it was.  I'm just saying it's the way it should be done.  Can I ask you, if you guys were going to do something like that over a house?  I'd kill myself.  If we were going to do it in one moment that would look like this, I would be sucking a  gun so fucking fast.  Now, coming up, open air, they're going to watch Penn and Teller do a shitty man.  Bang!  That'll be it.  And then you'd be on the show going, he would have wanted us to watch this to make fun of 
[01:30:00]  it.  That's what he would have wanted.  His final wish.  Holy shit.  And then he got flavor of flame, but he'll believe anything.  Yeah.  He's a good mark.  You don't have to believe.  I'll tell you, we did a thing.  We just did an experiment.  We were down doing some TV special.  It wasn't very good, by the way.  And we were down in the Caribbean.  And I got this idea, and it worked so much better than I wanted it to that I got really, 
[01:30:30]  really depressed and didn't want to put it on TV.  Oh, wow.  But the gag was, we gathered a crowd of people.  And I mean just a crowd of people that happened to be on the street, tourists and stuff.  And we said, hi, we're Penn & Teller, we're shooting a magic special, and we're going  to do the magic stuff later in another place, but we need your reactions.  And then we said, so we're going to stand here and do absolutely jack shit, and we're  going to get shots of you guys reacting.  Okay?  Now, these are not people who are desperate to get on TV for their career. 
[01:31:00]  These are just guys.  Random people.  Random people.  And I mean, random people, like 75 of them, and a completely sample of no filter whatsoever.  A good cross-section of society.  No filter.  Not a PA going out and saying, you, not you, you, but just come over here.  People come over.  And then we stand there, and Teller stands beside me, and I go, okay, I want you to all  look at Teller floating up here in the air.  And now he's spinning like this, and now he's spinning like this, and now he's going 
[01:31:30]  like this, and now he's going over like this, and now he's gone.  And we put cameras on him, and they all put their heads up, and they watch it, and they  turn.  And then I said, now we're going to do interviews.  And we sent someone out, and he said, what did you think of that?  And the people were saying, and I mean, without exception, people were saying, I was standing  right there!  Oh my God!  I've never seen anything like it! 
[01:32:00]  He just flipped in the air!  Is that okay?  Oh, I can do another one.  I swear to God!  You know, because the fact is, you are not reporting on what's happening in Afghanistan.  Right.  There is no moral issue whatsoever.  I'm asking you to lie about something that doesn't fucking matter.  Right.  So they'll say to people, you know, people say to me, well, you know, there are those  people in the audience at the Criss Angel show.  Are they set up or pay?  And I go, why bother?  Anybody will say anything. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  If I asked you guys, and I mean, let's speak honestly.  Penn and Teller are doing a special with celebrities.  We're bringing in OPDF&E.  We're going to do this amazing thing.  Oh, this sounds nice.  The first thing we say is, who canceled?  We're going to bring you guys in.  We're always good for a good cancellation.  And I'm not even doing a gag here.  I'm not even doing a gag at all.  I just want you to hypothetically think about this.  We bring you into a room, and we do a couple little card tricks for you, and then we say  to you after, we need a couple of cutaways. 
[01:33:00]  A couple of cutaways.  A couple of cutaways.  And we want you to say, well, we did get a chance to have you shuffle the deck, Anthony,  but just say you shuffled the deck and you brought the deck with you.  Are you going to go, absolutely not?  I have my integrity.  I have never been so insulted in my life.  Morals and scruples.  Cut us out of the show.  Right.  You're going to say, what the fuck?  No.  They're buddies of mine.  We hang out.  Who cares?  Make it look good.  I shuffled the deck thoroughly.  Thoroughly.  Yes.  I've never seen anything like it. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, did I shuffle the shit out of those cards?  But I'll tell you, when we were in the Caribbean doing this, Teller and I did this as a really  funny thing, and then we were really so depressed about it because it means we didn't have to  do anything.  Anything.  Ever.  Right.  Ever.  Yeah, why work?  Why work at it?  So did it look good when you put it all together?  We cut it together a little less depressing because the problem was we'd shot a segment  that undercut the whole rest of our show. 
[01:34:00]  You see what I mean?  All right.  Because the rest of the show, we were doing stuff with an audience reaction.  And it was just this weird little...  And people are going to start thinking, hey, wait a minute.  This weird little pet experiment where I said, how much do we have to do to get reaction  on the people?  Wow.  And it turns out, nothing.  Nothing.  Now, I don't know if you could do it without a TV camera.  You know, because the TV cameras are kind of the magic.  And then you say, we're shooting an NBC special.  It's going to be on in the fall.  If we get good reactions from you people, you'll be on TV. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, because everyone's thinking, oh my God.  If I've never seen it, I've never seen it in my life.  Right, right.  Was that okay?  Should I do another one?  Because they want to be on TV in the end.  They want to be on TV, but also that even that's a little bit too cynical.  They just, they're in the Caribbean.  They want to have a good time.  The real question is not something unpleasant and cynical like, I want to get famous.  I want to get on TV.  It's just, it's the afternoon we're fucking around.  Who gives a fuck? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  You have to remember that when the answer is, who gives a fuck?  So you show up at a Criss Angel shoot, you know, there's a, there's a guy there who does  a lot of sit-ups with, you can't draw an anarchy symbol, you know what I mean?  And he's there with his, with his baseball hat, you know, and there's Flavor Flavor and  Carrot Top and you're gathered around there and they go, uh, we're going to float shack  in the air.  There you go, far out.  Great.  Yeah.  Very cool.  It's going to be fun.  Sure.  It's show business.  And then you also are going, you know, you're looking up there and going, this will probably 
[01:35:30]  look okay on TV.  Did you look around the sky?  Like, I think shack would be floating around here by now.  I bet they cut that big crane out.  I bet they keep that out of the picture.  Sure, it's going to look great.  You guys didn't do the reveal on the audience thing though?  We did.  We did.  At the end, you said this is what they really were reacting to?  No, no.  We didn't even do it at the end.  We did it.  We did it as absolutely honestly and pleasantly as you could do.  We shot me saying all the stuff.  That's great.  We shot me with the audience behind me going, and now he's doing like this, you know, and 
[01:36:00]  now he's doing that.  It's a pretty funny clip.  And I'm just standing there and it's just so fucking naked.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just completely naked.  And when you watch the cut we gave you, there's just no doubt in your mind that every show  you'll ever see on TV is bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's not even, you know, you could put out all conspiracy, all cynicism, nothing. 
[01:36:30]  Just picture you and your friends fucking around on an afternoon to the Caribbean.  Right.  They go, hey, come over here.  You got drinks in your hands.  Yeah.  You've been laughing your ass off all morning.  There's two dipshits that you might have seen once on TV.  You know what I mean?  And, you know, one of you guys heard a joke he did once and kind of liked him.  Yeah.  So you go, hey, look at these over here, man, shooting a magic show.  I've seen those.  What are those like?  And you and your friends gather around, you see the show, you have done absolutely nothing 
[01:37:00]  immoral.  Mm-hmm.  No.  You've done nothing wrong.  You've had a good time.  Then you go and watch it on TV, and unless the people that are doing it are actual sons  of bitches, and then show themselves doing nothing, you know, your chances, the chances  of getting fucked that way, just about zero.  Hey, you know, we better not do big reactions, because these fucks might shoot the angle of  us seeing nothing.  No, that's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  You don't protect yourself against that.  Right, right.  You sign the release. 
[01:37:30]  You don't think they're going to actually show me asking you.  Just lie your ass off, and you're going, okay.  Oh, you rule.  God, you rule.  Yeah, and the way it's presented when the show actually is playing, it's very serious.  Yeah.  Like, they're all having fun.  It's like, yeah, just fucking say that you saw this, and it's great, and you had a good  time.  But then the ominous music is being played.  The angles.  And he's very, like, stoic.  You have to remember, you know, it was like when Clinton was running for his first term. 
[01:38:00]  You know, they talked about how, like, the MTV town hall, he was comfortable with the  microphone, and the older guys weren't, but he really knew how to.  Well, the fact of the matter is, yes, he did, but so did every other single person in the  United States of America.  If someone's house is on fire, you know, and they run out after watching their dog catch  fire and die, and a television camera goes out, they know how to give you the exact soundbite  that'll be used everywhere.  We've just all learned that. 
[01:38:30]  We've all learned that.  So, that means, when you know, when I call you up in the Caribbean, you got your drink  in your hand, you know, you're there with your squeeze, having a good time, let's go  over here, and I tell you, we're going to be, have a steamroller over here that's going  to be going 90 miles an hour.  It's going to be running over me in a scarecrow outfit, and you go, there'll be a towel on  the side, and you go, oh, okay.  Instantly, you remember every TV shot you ever saw, and said, you know, what is an Italian 
[01:39:00]  guy with a baseball hat, what's his job going to be?  Oh, yeah.  I'm the guy that's supposed to go, oh, shit.  Right, right, right.  Oh, shit, look at that.  You know, yeah, yeah.  You know exactly.  And when they go over to, you know, they go over to the heavyset African-American woman,  you know she's supposed to cry.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Each person, and you've learned that, you've learned that since you were a child from every 
[01:39:30]  time you've watched CNN, and every time you watch Chris Angel, they're teaching you how  to do the next Chris Angel show.  You know how to react, because you're going to be on TV, and you're going to have a good  time.  We've got a phone call coming in.  I've got to take Kirk in Houston.  Go ahead, Kirk.  Hey, guys.  When Trey Dapkins is on the show tomorrow, you're going to side with him that the magic is  hot, shit, real.  Yeah.  You bastard. 
[01:40:00]  But so, you do understand my point.  Absolutely.  Completely.  Absolutely.  Now, take everything I just told you, and add to that that these are B-level celebrities  who desperately want to be on TV.  Yeah.  That ratchets it up a little bit.  It really is amazing life.  But he still had to get the shack balloon in the air.  Didn't matter.  Yeah.  All the cuts and...  No, I know all the cuts and stuff.  It just amazes me that people put such credence in it because it's on TV. 
[01:40:30]  I love watching you just grasping.  Yeah.  No, because...  But, Daddy, isn't Submagic real?  No, no.  Is it impossible?  No, I'm coming from a different...  No, you're just saying, isn't it possible that maybe you never heard of him, but Peter Pan  somewhere like...  Peter Pan.  Actually, somewhere really could...  I mean, Dad, you never heard, but isn't it possible that, like, in Nigeria there's Peter Pan?  Maybe.  I'm coming from a different angle. 
[01:41:00]  I completely understand everything you're saying, but then I get mad that he thinks that a shack balloon is good enough to fucking float in the air.  And it moves like a balloon, and we're all supposed to go, oh, but that's, you know, not a balloon.  The thing is...  I like trying to figure out shit.  That's all.  You're not supposed to be watching it.  Good point.  Good point.  It's not for you.  It's a good point.  You know, they looked at the demographics and said, will anybody be watching this with the brain of their fucking head?  No.  We're fine. 
[01:41:30]  We're safe.  But what if, like, that guy from ONA, go, nah, probably not.  Nah, they wouldn't be watching.  He'd have to be really, like, real insomniate or something.  There's got to be nothing on at all.  Not even on demand.  Some brains are going to be watching.  We better, like, up our budget a little bit.  That's great.  Our special effects budget.  No, no.  No, no, no, no.  If someone with brains is going to be watching, we'll hire someone else.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice.  Hey, John in North Carolina wants you to talk about the most expensive car trick you ever did in the 90s. 
[01:42:00]  Is this a real story?  Yeah.  I think it's okay.  You know, we were...  It's the way we almost got Saturday Night Live shut down.  They almost turned it down for being live.  We got this idea, which I thought was really funny.  All by stories of nightmares.  Start with, I got this idea.  I thought it was really funny.  You've got a couple of those, too.  A few.  A few.  Plus a few years on the radio.  Yes, we do.  We do have a few of those.  So the idea was that we wanted to do... 
[01:42:30]  I'll talk about it philosophically for a moment.  Our idea was that the new magic was computers.  And that people believed computers could do anything.  Right.  So whereas in the 17th century you'd say, I'm in league with the dark arts, in the 20th century, the late 20th century, you'd say, we have a computer that can do this.  So the idea was we were going to do a card trick that would cost $300,000. 
[01:43:00]  And it would involve this very simple thing where I would take a fan of cards, fan them out.  The TV camera would throw the picture of the fan.  I'm sorry.  Take the cards, shuffle them up, hand them to somebody, pick one card.  And then I fan the cards to the camera.  The camera takes it.  The computer looks instantly at all the faces, figures out which one is missing, takes that card, throws it to the Jumbotron in Times Square, and puts the picture up in Times Square on the Jumbotron over the guy's head. 
[01:43:30]  And then I say, you picked the Seven of Diamonds.  Well, at that point, and even now, a computer couldn't look at all the faces and recognize them.  Oh, so, excuse me, you have to do a perfect fan.  Right.  And doing a perfect fan is not that easy.  You have to expose every card.  I'm not saying no one can do it.  I'm saying I can't do it.  So the idea was we were doing, there was no trick. 
[01:44:00]  We were telling people how it was done, but we were doing it a different way.  We went out to pre-tape it.  We got someone on the street and said, listen, we're going to have you go over there and buy a deck of cards.  This is the deck of cards you're going to buy.  And then you bring it over to me, and you open it up, and I'll say to you, you know, where are you from?  And you'll say Brooklyn, and I'll say, have I ever talked to you before?  And you'll say no.  Say no.  And then I'll say you just bought the deck over there, and you'd say, I swear.  And then, you know, probably swear in your children's eyes. 
[01:44:30]  I'm thinking.  And then you give them a shuffle.  And then you pick a card, but the cards are all the same, so you're going to pick the seven of diamonds.  We already know that.  And then you look at it.  Don't let anybody see it.  And then put the card back in.  And there's a guy who you're not going to see because the camera's moving around who's crawling around between my legs.  And when I drop my hands down, he's going to take the cards that are all the same out of my hand  and put in a glued-together fan that's perfect, and he's going to show it up there. 
[01:45:00]  And then we're going to spend three days in post doing a fake computer graphic that goes through and goes,  and picks every card and pulls that one out.  And then it's going to be up on the Jumbotron.  And then I'm going to look up there and go, your card's a seven of diamonds.  And you go, oh, my God, that's amazing.  I can't believe it.  And then your girlfriend looks up and points, and by then it'll say, like, nicely done, Rob, whatever the guy's name was. 
[01:45:30]  That's the gag.  So we go out.  We pitch it to Lauren, right?  And we go out, and he says, yeah, you can do it.  So we go out, and we shoot the whole thing.  It's a full, whole-night shoot there working the whole thing out, you know.  And the gag is that Teller is back in the studio running the computers.  He's doing the screen capture and doing this, doing the whole thing down there.  So we get the whole thing shot.  It looks fucking great.  And we show it to Lauren, and Lauren says, it's really, really wonderful. 
[01:46:00]  And then on the night of the show, all I have to do is, at the beginning of the show, put on a jacket,  walk out of the studio, and then go sit in the green room, put my feet up, and we roll the tape.  And roll the tape.  And then Teller is on stage, actually live, going and touching keyboards that don't do anything.  That is insane.  And the stuff's popping up in the world's most expensive cartridge.  And everybody goes, man, this is great.  This is fabulous.  And, of course, there's no real lie involved.  We're telling them it's a fake cartridge. 
[01:46:30]  We're doing it a different, fake way.  Right, right.  And it's a funny trick.  We're doing the whole gag.  And it's sad.  We're spending, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars to fool this one guy in Times Square.  The whole premise is there and everything else.  So we do the rehearsal, and the FCC guy comes over and goes, your chyron says live in Times Square.  Oh.  And we've already recorded this.  As a matter of fact, you have the chyron that says live on the pre-recording thing.  On the pre-recording.  And I go, yeah, it's a gag. 
[01:47:00]  And he goes, yeah, but we can't use the live chyron.  Even for a comedy show?  You can't throw it to live out in the streets.  Why?  And Lauren says, you know, fuck you.  We're just going to do it, right?  And the guy comes over and goes, no, no, no, we're getting serious.  And all of a sudden, it's one of those things that escalates.  And you've watched it happen.  I know you have.  Well, all of a sudden, everyone's got their dicks out, right?  You know, see whose dick is bigger.  You know, a moment ago, it was just discussing this little goofy piece of videotape. 
[01:47:30]  But now, it's like, who has more power?  The FCC or NBC?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And it escalates.  And Teller and I are there while this whole macho thing is happening, going, oh, listen,  we just want to show the, can we just show the, we just show the.  And then I'm saying stuff like, you know, let's just pull the chyron out and let people  assume it's live.  And when I say assume it's live, the FCC guy goes, exactly my point is Saturday Night 
[01:48:00]  Live.  They will assume it's live.  And I'm going, so we can't even take the chyron off now?  And Lauren's going, we're not taking no chyron off.  And I go, well, no, we could just pull that.  Could we just, and he goes, we're cutting the whole segment.  And Lauren goes, no, we're not cutting it.  And then they started going stuff like, well, can you actually go out to Times Square and  do it?  And I'm going, no, of course not.  I'm not magic.  See, the computer stuff we're showing doesn't really work. 
[01:48:30]  That's the favorite part.  The keyboards aren't even hooked up.  We can't, no, we can't.  They go, okay, we'll just go out and do the trick live.  I go, no, we're not.  We're not going to go out and do it live.  We don't, there's no trick.  There's no real trick, you dummy.  So it turns into this whole thing where the FCC guy says to me, he says to me, if you walk  out the studio with that coat on and that piece of tape goes, NBC is going dark. 
[01:49:00]  I'll just pull the plug on it.  And Lauren's going, they won't do that.  Wow.  And I go, if they do that, I'm going to get really yelled at.  I mean, I just know somehow it's going to be my fault, right?  You know what I mean?  Penn and Teller shut down NBC.  We are going to be reprimanded.  There's just no way around it.  You guys have experienced it.  If you shut down a network, someone's going to yell at me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  So we go to the host of the show.  I think it was Matthew Broderick or somebody.  And I wrote this thing and said, it said using computer technology. 
[01:49:30]  Digital access, high speed, pre-recorded tape, a whole list of things.  And I say to the guy, I'm sorry, I can't remember who the host was.  But I say to him, see this thing where it says pre-recorded tape?  You have to say that clearly so the FCC guy hears it and no one else in the country does.  That's your job during the introduction. 
[01:50:00]  You have to make that, this guy's got his whole dick on the line for you saying that.  But we have to make sure America doesn't care.  And man, the intro is great.  The intro, he just goes, and using incredible computer technology and graphics, pre-recorded  tape, and going out on Times Square.  Here he is.  I leave with the coat.  Here he is now from Times Square.  And it comes up live, and we're going, we said pre-recorded tape, it'll be okay.  And they let us do it.  And the FCC guy was still pissed as we're going. 
[01:50:30]  It's brinksmanship, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he goes, you know, if he doesn't say pre-recorded tape, we're just pulling the plug  at NBC.  So he went out and did the train.  Of course, now I think you'd be able to do it.  I think a computer would be able to.  If you didn't have Sasquatch with fucking lobster claws trying to do a fan in 20 degree  weather on the cold so that every index shows, you know, you have to be able to do that.  Yeah.  Oh, he's found it.  You've got it right there.  Oh, wow.  I've got to hear it.  What's that?  Steve Guttenberg.  Steve Guttenberg. 
[01:51:00]  Steve Guttenberg's introduction.  He's the guy.  What year is this, Penn?  What's that?  What year is this?  I don't know.  I've got a stupid haircut.  Steve Guttenberg looks like someone knows him.  It was 86.  86.  Whoa.  86.  He works out in our gym and no one gives a fuck.  I've got to do it there.  So computers could really not do this.  Wow.  It is so funny.  You know when something's escalating and you know it's escalating? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And there's just no way to get the lead rod into the reactor?  You can't bring it back.  No, there's going to be a meltdown.  It's always nonsense that gets in the way.  The whole thing of that is we're just annoyed at the FCC now.  Well, we've been through this.  Trust me.  I know you guys love the FCC.  And I hate to bum your shit.  I really do.  You know what?  I'm just saying, guys, the FCC's probably right about everything else.  Oh, sure.  Just this one case.  In the end, we didn't care about the FCC. 
[01:52:00]  It was our own lawyers that were in our way.  Well, that's true.  We would talk to them and go, this has nothing to do with the FCC.  It's going to be okay.  They always got in the way of creative people, and they were the nightmares.  What is that exact sentence?  This has nothing to do with the FCC.  It's going to be okay?  Yeah, it's going to be fine.  Precisely what I said.  1986.  But that's what you should have been saying.  Precisely what I said backstage.  This is not showing video of the Kennedy assassination. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, the FCC would have laughed at that.  They wouldn't have gave a shit.  They wouldn't.  No, it was an FCC guy there.  But it was an FCC.  So what?  They just have an FCC guy hanging out?  I don't know what was going on.  Can you imagine?  You never know what the real situation is, right?  When you're doing every month, you're doing a bit on Saturday Night Live, you are so out  of what's actually going on.  You know, you're just a card on the wall, Penn and Teller do six here. 
[01:53:00]  You go boom, Penn and Teller will do six there.  Boom, and Lauren okays the bit, and you go on.  You have no idea who they've been fighting with before that.  My question is, what were the lawyers doing?  Whose side were they on?  Do you remember?  I couldn't even remember Steve Guttenberg.  Fair enough.  Let's see how this plays out.  I actually want to see the whole bit now.  Are you rolling up?  I'm buying pre-recorded elements, graphics, and computer data, and created the world's 
[01:53:30]  most expensive card trick.  Ladies and gentlemen, Penn and Teller.  Pre-recorded elements.  We are Penn and Teller.  My name is Penn and Teller.  Wow.  I am live and freezing in Times Square.  Although we've had a little break in the weather here.  We're in Times Square, Manhattan, New York City.  And my partner Teller is live in Studio 8H in East, toasty and warm.  We're going to do the world's most expensive card trick.  We're going to spend $56,000 of NBC's money to fool two people chosen at random. 
[01:54:00]  Now, Teller does all the work on this one back in the studio.  And we're going to show you all the sneaky stuff.  We've got two computers with 140 megabyte hard disk drive here.  We've modified the hardware.  And we're going to make a lot of communicate and ask you to the digital graphics generator  of the NBC studios.  We've got a direct phone line and the appropriate modems to communicate with the spectacolor screen  high over Times Square.  And we reserve the online time in advance.  I've got a couple bucks to buy a deck of cards.  Let's do a card trick, okay? 
[01:54:30]  Part of me.  Joe, send them over now.  Oh, here.  Over now.  Yeah.  Hi.  You're Billy, is that right?  Hi.  And you're Kate.  I want to make clear to people at home that although we've been standing here waiting for a cue  and freezing together, but I haven't set anything up with you.  I haven't talked with you in advance.  You already lost Anthony, by the way.  The funny part of this thing is that you can use a brand new sealed deck.  Oh, there's rules now that you've explained the whole thing.  Should we circle me with a deck of cards, please?  Take a cards?  Yeah, actually, I'd rather they actually pick the deck, okay? 
[01:55:00]  Sir, just actually pick one.  Pick that.  Is that the deck you want right there?  That's the deck you told them to pick.  That's the deck you told them to pick.  That's the deck you told them to pick.  It's great, George.  It's on NBC, okay?  Here's a nice thing, okay?  Let's step over here, okay?  And just open the deck, obviously.  It was sealed when you started opening it.  Is that right?  Yeah.  And just open it, pull out the deck, and remove the jokers.  There'll be one on the top of the deck and one on the bottom of the deck.  There's one joker and there's two jokers, okay? 
[01:55:30]  Now, I want you to pick a card, but I want you to make sure that I don't see it  and the people at home don't see it, the camera doesn't see it, none of the people don't see it.  Yeah, they don't see it.  They're all the same.  I love it.  I love it.  Right there in case pocket.  And do not say the name of the card aloud because you have microphones on.  Right over here, pick the card.  Okay.  Now, here comes the real tricky part for me.  I have to do a perfect fan of the main card.  Now, there's a guy running by dick level crawling around with all the props. 
[01:56:00]  ...indexes of those 51 cards.  Now, this is a really tough move to do anyways.  It's hard to do quickly and it's especially hard to do in Times Square.  Now, you're selling it.  That's not on it.  Let's hope I don't screw it up.  They should be set.  Are you guys set?  Would you move back over here, please?  Okay, now, you chose the card.  Reaching down.  Yeah, the guy's handing you this stuff.  ...and you actually know what the card is.  Is that right?  ...and then we're over there.  Oh, don't.  Jesus.  Wow.  Look at these graphics. 
[01:56:30]  I actually touched the cards.  I didn't have to touch them at all.  I wasn't supposed to touch them at all.  I want to give the cards a shuffle, okay?  Now, uh, uh, it's freezing.  Holy shit.  Now, have you seen...  ...Pora Diamonds is the missing card.  ...and I'm still alive, like, like, six times or so.  So, the card is the four of diamonds.  Is that right?  It's over there.  Let's pull the card out where it's good. 
[01:57:00]  Four of diamonds, right there.  Keep the rest of the deck.  Keep the four of diamonds.  The copies of Penn and Tenor, the cast and crew send that live, NBC, and the parent company,  GE.  Thank you so much.  The parent company.  Oh, my God.  That really looks authentic.  Especially for 86, when people didn't know that computers could not possibly do that.  I think it's just a balloon to shack.  And the four of diamonds on the jumbo trial.  And we do a little gag.  We give it away at the end. 
[01:57:30]  Nice job, Kate and Bill.  Thank you.  Good night.  Good.  That's 28 years ago.  My God.  Jesus.  That's 28 years ago.  Good job.  What did reserving online space mean?  What did that mean?  Do you remember?  It beats jack shit.  Oh, man, nothing.  No, no.  No, what it means is reserving time for the sign.  Oh.  Because that song, that big a video thing, was a big deal in Times Square in the 80s.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, it was running ads all the time.  Yeah.  So, that was actually right about it.  That was the real bitch. 
[01:58:00]  When we were out there shooting it, we had to get the people to put four of diamonds and that stuff up there.  And, you know, when you want to see where the money is spent, the money is spent going from me to the sign and back down to me.  And all that's in one shot.  Which means, if we screwed it up, we've got to go back and do the sign again.  All over again and the sign again, right.  So, there's a guy behind me just screaming on a cell phone,  No, no, four of diamonds, four of diamonds, no!  Put it on the floor!  Oh, my God.  And, you know, the poor bastard, it's really cold. 
[01:58:30]  And Mark Garland, who was our prop guy, the whole time I'm walking, he's between my legs.  Holding the fan all glued together.  And the fan, we did the graphics first.  So, the fan was, had to fit in to the graphics.  Oh, right.  So, he had to glue each card in place.  In the right place.  Holy shit.  You'd think you would do the fan first, glue it, and then do the computer.  No, we did, we fanned the cards, glued it, and then did the computer graphics. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, okay.  But then, that fan was the hero fan.  Right.  So, we had to handle it really carefully.  And you see, those are two guys, they look convincing.  Yeah.  Even though there's a prop guy crawling around on the floor.  Sure.  Even though they're told which deck to pick.  Right.  Everything's set up.  And no one could possibly fan that deck like that.  That was like...  Perfect.  Perfect fan.  With all those megabytes of memory, though, you could have done everything.  Right?  Wow.  Listen, give me a break.  Many, many years ago. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Okay?  Those were...  That was real computer stuff.  Top of the line.  Yeah.  And you can see watching that, you'd go, I guess a computer could do that, right?  Sure.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, it's just...  That looks like a computer kind of thing.  And we work on that bit, which I'm really proud of, and all set to go.  It's all set to go right there.  I mean, Teller was live in the studio.  He had to type, and then turn around and type the other thing.  That's all he had to do.  I'm sitting in the green room in my coat, because I had to come back with a jacket as though  I'd been outside for the final waves. 
[02:00:00]  You know, and that's the whole thing.  And then there's this, you can't claim you're live in Times Square.  It's the whole trick.  It's a comedy show.  So just go out and do the trick for real.  Yeah.  It's not Brokaw saying he's, you know, in Libya.  We've heard that shit over the years.  We're at our homeless shopping spree.  You can't just do it in a Costco with no one there.  No, it takes away from the bit we're trying to do, you clown.  That's crazy.  Oh, my God. 
[02:00:30]  That's fantastic.  That's fucking great.  I love when you put shit down.  What are you promoting today?  Oh, yeah.  Now that you've been here an hour, we should promote.  You've got to get your promotions in.  There should be one professional in this room, shouldn't there?  Right?  Well, you would think.  Someone.  We've got a movie called Tim's Vermeer that opens here in New York and also in L.A.  Awesome.  It's at the Angelica and Lincoln Center, Lincoln Center Theaters, yeah.  Near us.  And it's really good.  A friend of mine, Tim Jennison, who invented the video toaster and Lightwave and did all 
[02:01:00]  this stuff, a genius guy.  About five years ago, I had spent a lot of time where I hadn't talked to anyone I wasn't  paid to talk to or was in my family for like months.  I hadn't had a conversation with a friend, with my wife, with my children, and with professional.  Nothing in between.  So I called up Tim who lived in Texas and said, I've got to talk to somebody. 
[02:01:30]  And he calls it.  There was a desperate phone call.  I remember it as being rather well measured.  And so he jumped on his plane, you know, because he's essentially Tony Stark, and he  flies to Vegas, and we go out, you know, for a big hairy steak because we're in Vegas.  And I tell him, listen, talk to me on something that has nothing to do with show business,  that I can't possibly be involved with movies or TV or live, nothing.  Just talk to me, you know, like a friend.  And he goes, how much do you know about Vermeer?  And I said, I don't know, probably the first page of Wikipedia, you know, painter, 17th 
[02:02:00]  century, photorealism.  He goes, yeah, I think I figured out how he did the paintings, and I'm going to build  an exact copy of his room in a warehouse in Texas, and I'm going to paint a Vermeer myself.  And I've never done oil painting before.  I'm going to grind the lenses and make all the paints myself, and it's all this poisonous  stuff from Russia that you can't get anymore.  I'm going to smuggle in illegal paint and do this.  And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you have failed. 
[02:02:30]  This is not something that has nothing to do with show business.  I'm making a movie.  And I said, stop everything.  We're getting a crew in.  And then for the next five years, while this nut builds an exact copy of Vermeer's room,  builds the harpsichord, makes the dresses, does everything, and then sitting there while  he spends ten months with this mirror set up, doing essentially a photographic process  from the 17th century to paint a painting. 
[02:03:00]  And we've got to tell them to direct it.  Wait, what makes a Vermeer different?  I don't know anything about it.  When you look at most paintings, they look something like drawings.  When you look at Vermeers, and if you pull up just some of the Vermeer paintings, pull  up the music lesson, Vermeer.  Try for the music lesson.  There is a quality where, now this is from the 17th century, it looks like you're looking 
[02:03:30]  at a Kodachrome slide.  Right.  I mean, look at that.  It does not look like someone painted it.  Right, gotcha.  You see that?  I mean, it's just, look at where the light is on the back wall.  And everybody's always said, how could this guy be this much of a genius?  And then David Hockney, the painter in England, said he thought he was using lenses.  But the thing is, you can't copy something from the lens.  You can't put a projection up and then paint over it, because as you paint, you actually  work against yourself. 
[02:04:00]  If there's blue there, you put more blue on, it doesn't look right.  So that doesn't work.  So Tim spent a year thinking about it.  He went over to Delft.  He learned Dutch.  We're talking about a committed guy.  That is a commitment.  We're talking about a committed guy.  Wow.  He started going over to Delft all the time.  Wow.  He studied this and finally figured out this elaborate arrangement of mirrors that would  allow him to do this incredible, painstaking process.  But then he wasn't enough to just say, okay, I think this is how he did it. 
[02:04:30]  He had to do it.  He wanted to do it.  And he didn't think it was fair to use anything that wasn't around in the 17th century.  So he ground every bit of pigment.  He, the lens that he used, he made himself, the mirror he used, he made himself, all using  technology from the 17th century.  And then he went into a room and drove himself insane.  Every brush stroke on the canvas we covered, some with nine cameras, but every one with at 
[02:05:00]  least three.  And then he made this movie about how he painted.  We went to Buckingham Palace and saw the original.  He was flying all over the world.  We were doing this.  And then my mind was just blown by it.  And I thought it would be a great movie.  He's not an artist?  I mean...  No.  Never painted before.  Never painted before.  Never painted before and decided he would paint a Vermeer.  So you pick the greatest painter of all time and say, I'm going to paint...  Okay, so that's the painting you're looking at there, Anthony. 
[02:05:30]  Uh-huh.  And you just say to yourself, well, you know, I've never painted before.  Yeah, let me do that.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to do.  Where's his copy?  Is it online yet or no?  His copy is...  In the movie, obviously.  It's in the movie.  And we don't have them up A-B yet because here's the problem.  And this is maybe giving away a little bit of the movie, but Tim's looks too good.  We're getting a scan from Buckingham Palace of the original so they can both be the same resolution.  This is very low resolution here. 
[02:06:00]  It's all that's available is low resolution.  It's photographs of it.  And it's...  You know, teledirected it.  I produced it.  I do a little bit of narration.  But mostly, you know, we make the joke in the movie that, you know, you really are...  What you're doing now, people, is you're watching paint dry.  I mean, the plot of the movie is a guy does a painting, but I think it's really funny  and really entertaining.  And he's been getting just blowjob reviews.  So he more than pulled it off in the end. 
[02:06:30]  That's unbelievable.  I think you might like it.  I think you should go see it.  I'm in.  It's in my...  I think it's in our artsy theater over there.  Yeah.  You know, it's artsy.  It's not, you know, it's not Spider-Man 4.  What would make anyone even think to go, like, how do you do that?  Like, why would you even think that?  I mean, it's amazing, but why would you even think that?  That's what Tim is.  You know, and I think the whole story of this is that Tim's youngest daughter went away to college.  Uh-huh.  And he was just like, what am I going to do? 
[02:07:00]  I've invented stuff.  I've made the...  You know, there's...  Can we get the...  I want to watch the trailer.  Is the setup life, like that scene that he painted, is set up...  He built it.  He built it.  He built the chair.  Right.  With the lathe.  He got the rug.  And then somehow that is focused onto a canvas.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  To be traced over for the most part.  Yeah, but the colors also have to be traced.  Right.  You can't just trace the shape. 
[02:07:30]  Sure.  So that's...  With no artistic ability as far as the painter.  He built the original set.  It's like a set, basically.  Yeah, well, it's not, except it's more...  Jesus Christ.  It's a little more real than a set.  I got you.  The stuff has...  That's unbelievable.  I got...  I am so in.  I don't even know how this fucking...  I am so in.  I am completely in.  Yeah, it's pretty...  It's pretty...  It's pretty mind-blowing.  Louie.  Hey, Lily.  Hey, man.  What's up, Louie?  How are you going?  What are you doing in town? 
[02:08:00]  Louis C.K., everyone.  What are you doing in town?  I live in New York.  That's right.  I live in New York.  We're talking about Penn's new movie called Tim's Vermeer.  This thing is fascinating, to say the least.  A friend of mine painted a Vermeer without ever painting before using a device.  And he made a movie.  Don't you have to be Vermeer to paint a Vermeer?  You think so, yeah.  Almost by definition, it's not a Vermeer if someone else paints it.  So it is...  We are using some sloppy language there, Louie, and thanks for busting us on that. 
[02:08:30]  Hence, Tim's Vermeer.  Tim's Vermeer.  I've recorded a Van Halen song last night.  Louie's Van Halen.  Louie's Van Halen.  Louie's Van Halen.  Yeah, you're really supposed to be Vermeer to paint.  Hey, you know what I'm addicted to watching?  Is your...  It would be funny if it was totally unrelated.  I'm totally into Downton Abbey.  No, your show...  Bullshit?  No, the one that...  Fool Me.  Fool Us, yeah.  Fool Us. 
[02:09:00]  It's really good.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  It's totally addictive.  It's actually coming out on CW.  They're going to show all the English shows.  It's English, right?  It's from BBC.  We did it over in England.  Actually, Channel 4.  It's really good.  But we're doing the English.  The English, it's exactly like the Beatles, in this one way.  The nine shows we did over in England become ten shows over here.  Right.  Because of more commercial time and so on.  Like the way Beatles albums were re-  Well, remember yesterday and today. 
[02:09:30]  Yesterday and today is the Beatles record that doesn't exist in England, only over here.  Right.  And that's why the Beatles did Butcher Cover, because they thought they were butchering the  records by putting a couple songs off to make more money in the U.S.  That's right.  That's right.  Nothing to do with the floor.  Butcher Cover's worth a lot of money now.  Yes, the Butcher Cover.  I have two of them.  You do?  I have one because when I went into interviews and they said, if I wanted to know all the  secrets to your show, what would you give up all the secrets for?  And I said, if I have an unpeeled, sealed, Beatle Butcher Cover, I want it in mint condition. 
[02:10:00]  By the way, there are ten in the world.  I want one of them.  Wow.  If you give me one of those, I will tell you how every secret in the show is done.  You sit down with me, I'll tell you everything.  I said that in an interview.  I said that in a bunch of interviews.  I thought it was really, really funny.  About three weeks later, there came a Beatle Butcher Cover, beautifully packed with everything 
[02:10:30]  there.  I pulled it out, held it up.  There was a note with it that said, love Teller.  Now shut the fuck up.  So Teller got me the Beatle Butcher Cover.  So wait.  Just put an end on that.  It's the one you don't need.  It has the new cover.  It has yesterday and today.  And you hold it up to the light.  And you can see the Butcher Cover underneath.  And you can see Ringo's black turtleneck.  And you can see him holding a bloody doll.  Right.  How much is it worth, you think?  How much?  I don't know now.  I mean, when John Lennon was shot, I was like, yes! 
[02:11:00]  And Mitch George Harrison done.  Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.  Harrison is dead.  I'm waiting until the other two kick in.  Then, yeah!  I don't know.  Probably thousands, not tens of thousands.  Yeah.  Right.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  Unless you take it to the Pawn Stars place.  Then they'll be like, ah, we've got to frame it.  Ah, you know, there's no real market.  The Beatles weren't a very popular band.  Eh, ten bucks.  Yeah.  Louie.  I'm so glad you like Fool Us. 
[02:11:30]  I'm so glad you do.  I love watching it.  Have you seen any other?  No.  How do I see it?  No, not that one.  No.  You would see it illegally, like Louie does.  I watch it on YouTube.  I'm going to go check that out.  The gag is, magicians, we did this all legit.  There was no, there was no, I mean, we were kind of nuts about how legit we were.  Yeah.  We were separate rehearsal days.  Right.  And magicians come out and do a trick for us once live, Teller and I watching it.  They do it once live in front of a live audience, and then Teller and I have a minute or two 
[02:12:00]  to talk about it.  And if we cannot figure out how the trick is done, they get a shit ton of money and get  to fly to Vegas and open for our show.  Oh, cool.  Pretty cool.  And as it went on, and as it got more popular in England, it was pretty successful over  there, people started writing tricks just to fool us.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  And they didn't care at all about entertaining the audience.  Right.  It was just trying to fool us.  Right.  And I don't know if you saw these bastards from the Netherlands, I think. 
[02:12:30]  The guy wrapped his face in tape or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he, those guys, they did a move that they didn't do, which made me crazy.  He brought his hand over the deck and palmed off a card when he didn't have to.  Oh, so you got that thrown in and think it's some part of them all about fooling them  now.  Wow.  Yeah, it's not about the trick anymore.  They didn't care at all about the trick.  And our good friend, Johnny Thompson, who's the best magic mind alive. 
[02:13:00]  He's just a genius.  Right.  He was in charge of helping them.  So they would say that for the good of the show, probably one out of every ten magicians  should fool Penn and Teller.  So Johnny would go back and go, I know Penn doesn't know about this move.  I'll put this in there.  And so they were being directed and helped and stuff.  I think it's the best show we've done.  It's pretty great.  Is there a guy who had these cards, like the way he guessed the card was that he fanned 
[02:13:30]  them and then it spelled out what the card was.  Oh, yeah.  The guy from Montreal.  I thought I figured it out.  I don't think you did.  You don't think so?  No.  Because I think he has a deck made that, depending on what the card is, it fanned out.  He has four outs.  Right.  Exactly.  He's got the color and the higher low.  It is a combination.  In magic, the hardest tricks to figure out are the tricks with multiple outs. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  Which means the punchline you see is not the punchline it's going to be every time.  So you're trying to figure out how can he do this trick every time.  He's got another five tricks he can do and you don't know when he's going to fork.  Because I figured out he's got this deck and since it's white on all sides, he doesn't  have a front or back problem.  So as soon as he asks somebody, is it red or black, then he just does this value.  Yeah.  And then he's got another thing of work.  And then he's got like, is it higher low, just do this.  But he also had that box on the table just to fuck it. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  This does it for certain.  And then he had this box that he kept talking about the box.  Yeah.  And so these guys decided it's the box.  The box is the thing.  And so he opens the box and the box says, no.  So he's got a clever way of saying, fuck you.  He knew exactly.  And some of the guys would come out and do a fabulous routine and then look at us and  go, yeah, I know you got it.  Thanks.  Good night. 
[02:15:00]  I'm on TV already.  I'm on TV.  Didn't they blow the trick by telling you how they did it or not?  That's what we did.  They were told backstage.  They were told backstage.  The producers told them, if Penn and Teller get it, they will tell you they got it and  they will give you little hints.  And if you believe they really got it, be polite, walk away, they will never bust your  trick.  If you push, Penn will take you out. 
[02:15:30]  And there's one guy who did a beautiful routine.  I don't know if you saw.  He did coins across on hands.  He had two audience members hold their hands out and he moved coins across here and there.  So he finishes up and it was a beautiful routine.  I mean, it killed.  It destroyed.  And he was kind of punk, goth type guy.  And Teller and I go to our little discussion where the audience can't hear.  And Teller goes, the coin shells are magnetic and the big kind of ring on his left hand is 
[02:16:00]  a magnet.  And he's pulling them off with that so he doesn't have to palm and can hold his hands  flat.  It's the ring that's magnetized.  Okay.  So I go, yeah.  Okay.  Cool.  So they come to us.  The audience hasn't heard this.  And I go, oh, man.  Great routine.  Never seen that done that well.  That's great.  I think we've got it.  I think we have it.  He goes, well, I don't think you do.  And I go, yeah.  Okay.  Well, what I'm asking is, would you be able to do that in a different wardrobe than you're 
[02:16:30]  wearing?  Right.  And he says, yes, I could.  And I go, okay.  Would you be able to do it with different jewelry, changing your watch and so on?  He goes, my watch has nothing to do with it.  Oh, you're an idiot.  You dummy.  That's right.  Your watch has nothing to do with it.  But I'm just saying, if you were doing it with no jewelry at all, would the trick still 
[02:17:00]  work?  And he goes, I don't know.  And I go, listen, asshole.  You've got a magnetic ring on your left hand.  It's the big one that looks like the devil.  They're all shells on top of the coins.  You're pulling the coins out.  That's the way you did it.  Get off the stage.  And the guy is just totally heartbroken.  And he was the only one that we really ripped the new asshole because we told him.  The magician's shitty hint taker. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, it's usually this really careful, was it a trick?  And the guy's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's enough.  And there was someone else.  I really, I really shouldn't tip this, but I'm going to figure it's away from their act  and enough people won't put it together.  But the one that made me laugh the most was we, uh, was a guy and a woman, I guess.  And the guy vanished on stage and appeared in the back of the theater. 
[02:18:00]  All right.  And it was a really good trick.  And they were like 19 years old.  Okay.  And they were good.  They finished the whole act and, uh, Teller, Teller and I look at each other.  We didn't say a word.  We just look at each other.  I go, okay, we got it.  And we come back to the guy and I go, if Teller and I weren't old and fat, if we were  19, it could run as fast as you could and could do everything as fast as you could, could  we do this trick?  And the guy goes, well, I don't know. 
[02:18:30]  And I go, right.  Okay.  Let me tell you, uh, I have, uh, I have an older sister and Teller's an only child.  If we could run as fast as you, could we do this trick?  Well, uh, is there a genetic component to your trick?  Oh, and I said, I, he said, uh, I don't know exactly what that question means. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  I said, is there someone else in your family that appeared in this trick that not everyone  here is aware of?  And he goes, I don't know what, I said, okay, here's what's going to happen.  You are twins, identical twins.  The guy in the back, the guy I'm talking to now is not the guy that started the trick.  You are twins and you are 19 years old and you are magicians and you have a whole career  ahead of you and I'm not willing to blow it. 
[02:19:30]  So what we're going to do right now is you only blow it up for this audience here.  We're going to go back to be saying, could we do this trick?  And you're going to say no.  And then you're going to smile.  Oh, wow.  And you're going to go away, okay?  Because I'm the nicest guy in the world.  You're cutting slack there, man.  And he goes, yes, sir.  So I go, okay, audience, back to the applause.  And there's no director, anything.  I'm just doing this on my own.  Director.  And then the director comes to me and goes, I really want to use the hunk of you saying 
[02:20:00]  their twin.  I go, I really, I really, I really think we shouldn't.  You know, I wrecked their careers.  Well, they can't use that again.  And I'm sure they used that twin thing in more than just one trick.  For sure.  Fucking gross.  We'll go in for the rest of their lives.  I mean, there is a famous magician who is a twin and you don't know it.  The great Dan Tom.  You could do worse, though, than dissuading a couple of 19-year-olds from being magicians. 
[02:20:30]  Absolutely.  That's true.  Or you could.  The two of you twins, you could go into porn.  They might just go get a skill that is actually...  You could go into porn and make some real money.  That's right.  That's right.  You're twins, for Christ's sake.  A more noble career.  I wonder if there's any magic porn.  I wonder if there's porn that involves sleight of hand.  Let me just...  You've thought of it, right?  Well, just now.  So there's a porn version of it.  Right.  That's right.  Well, hold on.  Were they identical or fraternal?  They were close enough to fool very, very, very close. 
[02:21:00]  That was such a bad joke, I actually had a real explanation on it.  So there's a magician out there that's like, well-known, well-known magician that has an  identical twin.  That's hilarious.  There was a performance in Tahoe where that twin was injured, and all of a sudden, the  other guy, identical in the same outfit, ran out to help him.  And you saw him very confused.  Oh, that is...  Oh, because they wouldn't travel together, and the guy wears a baseball hat, and they're 
[02:21:30]  not ever in the same hotel, and they keep everything separate.  And the other guy, you know, there's one guy that does all the talk, and the other guy  that's just a double.  It's just, you know, it's just this, okay, that's my job.  I'm the fucking twin.  I go around the rest of the time.  And of course, you have to remember that the guy who did all the talking up front is  the talented, good talker.  And the guy who appears in the back is the idiot.  Wow.  So when I'm giving them the explanation, I'm talking to the idiot. 
[02:22:00]  That's right.  And the guy, the other guy who's in the back is like, shut the fuck up, you moron.  And he's doing his backstage.  You're ruining my...  I don't know.  I don't know, I don't know.  I just, my brother told me to stand over there.  I don't know.  He probably actually doesn't know what he does.  It's an idiot, yeah.  He just goes like, just fucking stand here.  When the light goes on, you make a big ta-da thing.  I'll stand here, people start clapping. 
[02:22:30]  The visual is a twin losing his mind backstage.  Oh, that's terrific.  We have to take a break, unfortunately.  Yeah, we do.  What's your schedule?  I'll go away, I'll do whatever you want.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  Jesus.  Well, we'll figure it out.  Yeah, we'll figure it out during the break.  Fuck it.  Uh, Penn Jillette, Tim's Vermeer.  That opens up this weekend, right?  That seems pretty fucking cool.  Absolutely.  Do see that movie.  What a dedicated, fucking obsessed motherfucker.  We like to see movies about crazy people.  Right.  And Louis surprised us today. 
[02:23:00]  This is awesome.  Well, I knew he was coming, but I kind of kept it in my head as a surprise.  I just came to talk to him, to Penn.  Yeah, Penn.  Exactly.  My movie starts tomorrow on my website.  I came by to tell you about it.  Oh.  What movie?  What movie?  It's called Tomorrow Night.  It's a movie I made back in 98.  And it's on my website starting tomorrow at noon.  Yeah.  I never got it released.  Steve Carell is in it.  Jamie Smooth.  Holy shit.  Amy Poehler for about 10 seconds.  Yeah, I made it wait.  It's my first movie.  I read about that. 
[02:23:30]  Never got it distributed.  People are like, oh, Louis got a new movie.  That's an old movie.  Oh, shit.  Cool.  We'll talk about that next.  Penn Jillette's probably going to hang out, so stay there.  All right, guys.  All right.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that.  99, maybe.  And he goes, dude, what are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village.  I'm going to fucking hang out.  I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  On the way over, we cabbed it. 
[02:24:00]  And some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books and notebooks.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is the guy from Saturday Night Live is going to send him back his books.  Well, this is a thorn in Lars's ass for the minute I get it.  For the minute I get it, dude, what are you?  Dude, the fucking nap.  You really fucked ridiculous.  You need like a bag walking around with this fucking knapsack.  So I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid. 
[02:24:30]  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  It'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  So what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up, and the bags go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  Are we hanging fucked in the knapsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  He keeps getting on my face.  Are we hanging on a wall?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this. 
[02:25:00]  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  You'll be happy.  On SiriusXL.  You absolutely can't.  No, no, no.  For the record, we did not kick Penn Jillette out. 
[02:25:30]  He had to go.  He had to go and do other press for Tim Vermeer.  Yeah.  Which looks like a fascinating movie.  Very cool.  Absolutely.  And Louis C.K. surprised us today.  This is awesome.  Hello, fella.  I was just talking about you the other day because I'm a huge fan of comedians in cars  getting coffee.  Oh, yeah.  And your episode was really, really good.  Oh, thanks.  And how you described getting high and going to the movies was amazing.  Yeah.  And I think I want to smoke pot now because of that. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah, that was funny.  Because it's been many years.  Yeah, no, I've got it down to this exact science.  Yeah.  The theater I go to, there's an elevator that takes you straight to the IMAX.  So you don't have to go through the whole theater.  And I've got it.  I have the whole thing down to an exact.  This is how I do this.  Yeah.  I haven't done it for a little while.  You know exactly when to time it.  Gravity was fucked up.  Gravity.  That didn't freak out a little bit?  Well, 3D IMAX high.  Like, you know how they have those logos?  It should say, like, 3D IMAX high. 
[02:26:30]  It's the best way to see a movie like Gravity.  Yeah.  I didn't otherwise like.  I didn't like the performances.  Right.  And I didn't know why these are the people.  That were in the movie?  Who are being called the astronauts.  Right.  Yeah.  It's two people.  And you could have gotten anybody.  They should have just had two.  It wouldn't have been these two, you know, terrific.  Made great contributions to theater of the screen.  Yes, of course.  But why fill their faces with chemicals to make sure they look like astronauts. 
[02:27:00]  I mean, you could get, there's so many people.  Right, right.  And also the idea that she's like a reluctant astronaut.  There's no such thing as like someone's like, oh, I mean, the other thing didn't work out.  So I'm an astronaut.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I hate space.  And an astronaut was something to fall back on.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm so stressed out when I'm in space.  Like a trade.  Yes.  You know.  This is what would happen if you're like, whatever, what, she's some scientist. 
[02:27:30]  You go to NASA if you got an interview.  Yeah.  Okay, you be her, okay?  All right.  And I'm going to ask you about how you feel about the program.  And be, sound a slight, a little hesitant.  Okay.  Okay.  So, are you excited to try out to be an astronaut?  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of my office.  There's a fucking, there's the best, the greatest people alive do this.  Right.  Everybody wants that gig.  And it's their dream from the second they left the womb, all they want to do is go into 
[02:28:00]  space.  They never gave up on being an astronaut.  That's hilarious.  If you're obsessed with being an astronaut and you are the best at everything that you  do, you're still going to wash out and not get to space.  Right, right.  Yeah.  And yet this fucking, like, ugh.  And I get vertigo.  No, you don't.  Fuck you.  And again, you know, I don't know.  But, you know, when you're that fucking stoned and you're in the picture and you're going 
[02:28:30]  inside of the helmet looking at the world from inside the helmet, it's all, it's pretty  cool.  Not a freak out, though?  You're not a freak out pot guy where it's like, ah, this is like fucking freaking me out.  No, because I don't, because they're not, they don't know I'm watching them.  So they're not interacting with me.  If I interact with human beings who are looking at me, I don't like that.  Oh, that'll freak out a little bit.  That would be the thing.  Yeah.  The vastness of space thing would get me a little.  No, I could fall right into that.  Yeah, yeah.  Except for I was getting also irritated by the lack of truth with the physics. 
[02:29:00]  Because they had an opportunity to teach people physics.  Right.  Where did they fail?  It was a bunch of shit.  There was a couple of times where they said they were off, like when they were holding  each other's fingers, they said all she would have had to do in real life was just pull  back gently and he would have come right back.  That's right.  There's the whole, basically the entire crux of the drama of the movie was a giant fuck  you to physics.  Of physics.  The idea that she's holding him and there's some force pulling him more and more, like 
[02:29:30]  an increasing force from what?  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  Centrifugal force, was it?  No, I don't think so.  Were they spinning?  Nope.  No, they weren't.  They weren't spinning.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, although if she pulled like that.  A teeny bit he would have come right back.  But then she would have gone forward too.  When she's spinning.  Yeah.  And she's going, ah!  Oh!  Oh God!  Oh God!  Close your fucking eyes.  Close them.  You're not, you won't, you're not feeling it.  You're not feeling yourself spinning. 
[02:30:00]  Close your eyes.  Yeah.  That's all you would have to do.  Because the Earth is doing this spinning around.  It's all relative to.  Close your eyes.  Like the Earth, so.  60 seconds.  Yeah.  She wouldn't even have to be reminded.  But even if, honey, close your eyes.  All right.  Okay, good.  I'm good.  Everything's fine now.  I'm good.  That's a good point.  But I wouldn't have thought of that if I was spinning away into nothing to see this.  She probably just forgot.  She forgot.  Yeah, no, she's clumsy and a little forgetful.  Yeah.  She's like Lucy in the end of the day.  Lucy!  It's the face!  It's the face! 
[02:30:30]  When George asked her where she's from, like, wouldn't they know all that?  Yeah.  That took me out of the movie.  I'm like, they would know all that before they went up there.  You have any kids?  Right.  But, yeah.  So tell me about you.  Where are you from?  They would know everything about each other.  Every detail.  What did they talk about during the training?  He just kept saying, your cunt stinks a lot.  That's all he talked about in the training was in our congress.  That was the first thousand things he said.  One thousand and one was, where are you from?  Yeah.  Do you have any kids that ever fall out of that dump?  Yeah, and guess what?  If you have, like, a background that's edgy, like your son died, they also, you know, we're  not putting you in space. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  That's going to come up.  That could be a problem.  Yeah.  It's going to come up.  You're going to bum everybody out with that shit.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't need you up there all of a sudden waxing fantastic about your kid.  No.  Worthless.  Fucking things up.  Wow, you know.  Billions of dollars that shit costs up there.  They had a...  Yeah, they had a...  They need boring, steel, fucking-nerved people.  Right.  You ever watch some of those guys on camera when they're having a spacewalk, like, they've  got to replace that giant cooling unit that's the size of a refrigerator?  Their dialogue back and forth is just the most...  Mundane.  ...technical, dull, fucking, blah, the bolt is out. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  Well, like, if you ever listen to black box recordings to fall asleep in this...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Have you ever jacked off to black box recordings?  Yes, yes.  Yeah, voice recordings.  Yes, they have some on YouTube and stuff.  I've seen...  I've actually was listening to some of those just last week.  Yeah, I swear.  They're fucking tragic.  Well, they are...  The pilots, even in the worst conditions, are steel until the very last second.  Yeah, then you get the...  Okay, we're going to try this.  We're going to try this. 
[02:32:00]  This didn't work.  This didn't work.  The wing came off.  We're going down.  We're going to work 50 yards from the ground.  Ah!  It's the last sound.  It's like, it is the last...  But they're not panicking.  Right before it, they're like, we're trying to try this.  That's what all pilots are like, and people in space are like the 0.00001% best of those people.  Right.  Right.  That's so crazy.  That's exactly what it was.  That guy, Sully, who landed the plane on the Hudson, with steel nerves, he would have washed out. 
[02:32:30]  He would have never made it.  Never would have made it to space.  If something fucked up there, he would have been fucked up.  But meanwhile, in the plane, we're not going to make it.  We're in the river.  Yeah, exactly.  We're going to try the river.  We're going to try the river.  We're going to try the river.  That's literally what he said.  Wow.  I like your boat.  They showed the boat in the...  Oh, yeah.  That's a nice vessel.  That's my summer.  That's where I spend my summer.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  And where do you go with that?  I go up the Hudson River.  Oh, okay.  And then I go out to Long Island Sound. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, right.  She can go out in the ocean, but the ocean's trickier.  I'm going up...  My experience, the river seems like...  That I'm good at...  Yeah.  The river's nothing.  But it seems like it's cool to explore and stuff, too.  It is a bit.  It gets a little mundane up there.  It does.  But there's some great places that you can easily anchor and swim when you get up past the Tappan Zee.  And there's a few towns that you can pull up to a dock and get ice cream.  You know, and my kids love it.  And then the Long Island Sound, though, I went to Martha's Vineyard last summer and back... 
[02:33:30]  With the boat?  Yeah.  Oh, that's like the entire sound.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's...  How long does that take from where you're docked?  You can do it pretty fast or you can go...  I mean, I went out there in about four days with the kids.  And you stop in a bunch of places.  And, you know, the boat's got...  You can eat on it and cook on it.  So I just...  I mean, last summer I lived on the boat for about a month.  Like, I didn't...  Jesus Christ.  I slept on it every night for a month up the river, out the sound.  I just stayed out of the city.  You just stayed on it for a month straight.  Yeah.  Two weeks with my kids, two weeks with my kids. 
[02:34:00]  That's awesome.  Just by yourself?  Yeah, part of it by myself.  Did you see Redford's movie where he was on the little sailboat?  Yeah, I hated it.  I hated it.  Thank you.  I hated it.  I did, too.  It was a piece of shit movie.  What a fucking...  Like, I kind of got, like, at the very beginning, with the shipping container and everything,  I'm like, oh, okay.  This is a little...  Yeah, but you know he dies.  Well, yeah.  You know that it's worthless.  Right.  Yeah, because they kind of popped out at the beginning.  Because the movie starts with none of this worked. 
[02:34:30]  I tried everything, none of it worked.  And then, okay, so here's the first thing that didn't work, which was bailing out and,  you know, fixing the hole.  Right.  He's also a fucking asshole.  The whole...  I was screaming at the screen the whole movie,  because he tries the radio for, like, a minute.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he's like, eh.  I would be on that.  Especially if you started getting a little something.  Yeah, and also, you don't just hail your fucking...  This is my ship's name.  Nobody gives this shit...  No one cares.  Mayday.  Mayday.  Mayday.  Right, you're right.  If you say...  I'd be falling asleep with my hand on that switch saying Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. 
[02:35:00]  She wants your voice.  Because if somebody hears Mayday slightly, they know what the...  There's a problem.  Yes, because these radios, the VHF radios, have a limited radius.  Uh-huh.  So if somebody hears Mayday, they know within five miles of me, somebody's in trouble.  Yeah.  And there'd be helicopters swarming.  Yes.  And also, like, the ship comes, he's reading the directions on his fucking flair.  On his flair.  And then he pops one, and the ship is still, like, 90 feet away, and he's like, yeah, I 
[02:35:30]  don't think they see me.  I'm just gonna go ahead and die.  And then, the one thing he does that is the stupidest, but, like, when he makes the fire  in the little tub...  In the little tub thing.  I go, okay, he's doing this because he's gonna float the tub out into the water.  Why wouldn't you put it in the water?  Why are you making a fire in your rubber raft, you stupid fucking idiot?  That was him giving up.  But if you're gonna make a fire in your raft and set the whole thing into a ring of blaze, 
[02:36:00]  there's a ship right there.  Give it ten minutes to see if the ship comes.  Don't just fucking sink beneath it.  I'm gonna go into water now.  He really did just give up.  Yeah.  Asshole.  Too many times.  Asshole.  And, well, the guy that made the movie, what was his name?  Robert Redford?  No.  He got...  He was like, oh, well, the ending is left open to interpretation.  Oh, is it?  Did he die or did he not die?  Was that the hand of the filmmaker's best friend?  I don't give a shit who it was. 
[02:36:30]  Stupid Hollywood.  Stupid Hollywood trying to give you a little...  Give you a little hope?  Yeah.  You say he's dead, right?  Yeah, I suppose.  I mean, I hope so.  I really hope that character's dead.  He wasn't even being careful.  I have on my boat...  Like, that guy's some kind of a jillionaire.  I have on my boat this plastic, looks like a Fisher-Price thing.  Yeah.  Everybody that comes on my boat, I tell them, if you're the only...  If we're sinking, grab this and don't let...  Press this one big red button. 
[02:37:00]  And there's the beacon.  And don't let go.  If you press that button, fucking people will come and find the button.  They all come.  Yeah, and it's water-sealed.  It doesn't...  You know, it's an impervious to anything device.  Yeah, why do we have that?  Costs about...  Well, because he can't afford it.  You know, it's like a subscription of about $20 a year.  Yeah.  And the unit itself is about $118.  You got a sat phone?  Yeah.  What?  You got a sat phone?  I don't have one yet, because I haven't been out in the open water like that.  I still have only been in places where... 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, you could get a self-signal.  I've lost...  Like, between Block Island and Martha's Vineyard is the longest expanse that I've done.  Yeah.  And you lose sight of land for a few minutes, like you're out in the open.  And the ocean is hitting you, broadside.  It's hard.  Yeah.  But I've always gone out a little further than I'm comfortable with, a little at a time.  Yeah, yeah.  I go out, and then I freak myself out a little, and then I come back.  Come back.  But now I can get to Martha's Vineyard on my own, so I know how to do that.  That sounds awesome. 
[02:38:00]  You're taking little charts, are you?  Yeah.  Reading charts.  Reading some charts.  I always keep...  I mean, I have a GPS, and it has a chart system in it.  But the boat was built in 2004, so the navigation equipment...  I mean, 2004 and technology.  Yeah.  That's crazy different.  It's old, right?  So my iPad gets me everywhere I'm going.  Fucking iPad.  iPad has a thing called iNavX.  It's just an app.  Yeah.  It has the entire American coastal water. 
[02:38:30]  Isn't that amazing?  Literally, I can jump on the boat with my iPad.  Yeah.  I keep two on board for redundancy.  Sure.  I keep one plastic wrapped in a place where a fucking shipping container can't destroy...  Can't fuck it up.  Let me keep everything right next to the gunwale, like right next to it.  Just no waterproofing anything.  So if anything hits it, you know, it's sure to drench it with water.  It's like keeping a coffee cup on your fucking laptop.  Eventually, it's going to tip over. 
[02:39:00]  But yeah, my iPad can get me anywhere I want to go.  Isn't that amazing?  Because it's not very long ago you needed that stupid fucking star thing and the charts.  Yes.  And you're like, argh!  But I keep the paper charts and I use the Ritchie compass, which is a basic compass.  Yeah.  I keep referring to those because I do think at some point if all the shit shut down on  me, you'll know.  I can do it.  I could get myself home from anywhere using the markers that are in the water and a compass 
[02:39:30]  and a chart.  Can't they get like a fucking satellite thing of that so you'll never lose reception?  Isn't it like a satellite instead of a satellite phone?  But you can lose power.  There's all kinds of stuff that can happen.  And also in some weather, GPS starts to fail.  Yeah.  So you always keep the paper charts and you keep, you know, because it's not just about  where you're going.  Like there is a part of when you come out of New York Harbor, when you go out the Long  Island Sound after the Whitestone Bridge, no, the Throgsnecks, that's the last one. 
[02:40:00]  Then you're in the Long Island Sound and there's this huge expanse of water.  You go out to City Island and out to the Sound.  And I didn't read the chart right the first time I did it and I went flying through this  big, and there's no other boats except for little fishing boats and all the guys are  looking at me like, kind of shaking their heads.  What is he doing here?  I've got this big fucking boat with a five foot draft.  You don't belong there.  No, and then I look through it under, because you can't tell from the surface, underwater there's 
[02:40:30]  rocks that are like within an inch of the surface.  Holy shit.  And there's just, you know.  You should have put a 13 year old blonde boy on the front and let him navigate for you  and then hit a rock and you could have molested him when the fucking Catherine Hepburn came  with a sandwich.  Exactly.  But I know I was just very lucky that I flew through there without him.  Yeah.  I easily could have destroyed the boat.  Jesus.  It gets scary sometimes in a little bit of weather when the boat slams down and you get that  bam!  Bam, bam, bam! 
[02:41:00]  And it's like really loud and you're thinking, this thing's going to break.  Yes.  It's going to break.  No, I've had a few times on the boat where I've thought, uh, I'm going to go home and  I'm never going to do this again.  A little scared?  Whenever I dock this thing, I'm going to put a sign on it for sale and I'm going to take  the train home.  You got a little scared a couple of times?  Sure.  Very scared.  Yeah, yeah.  Very scared.  The first time I went to Block Island, I scared the shit out of myself.  Really?  Yeah.  Was the weather nice or was it just too big?  Well, it's the times that the waves were enormous for me.  Oh, right. 
[02:41:30]  I thought they were like four or five foot waves was probably like two feet.  But it's rolling, a lot of rolling.  Wow, you're slapping up and you're moving and, uh, Block Island is like this little sliver  of brown and it looks so far away.  I could miss that.  But this is why sailors drink because then you get there and you're in this calm, you  go into the protected cove and it's calm and you throw an anchor and you're okay now  and you just want to drink time like a whole bottle of whiskey.  A whole bottle of brown.  Like a whole bottle of whiskey. 
[02:42:00]  Yo, ho, ho.  And then, were you dreading the ride back?  Were you like, oh, fuck, I gotta leave this safe day?  Yeah, then the next day as I'm getting ready to go, I realize I'm starting to breathe heavy.  Yeah, a little anxiety.  This is gonna fucking suck.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But I've done that so many times.  Like, there's a place called Plum Gut where you go from Long Island Sound into the ocean  and those two bodies of water meet in this bizarre end-of-the-world-looking, roiling...  Wow.  It's two different currents and they meet like in a line. 
[02:42:30]  And you gotta cross over it.  And you have to cross over that line and there's a little, thin, narrow little channel  with rocks on one side and all these hazards.  It's just danger.  And your boat can't, your propellers can't really find the footing because there's all  this spinning.  Yeah, yeah.  So you just kind of have to hope through it.  And the first time I did it, yeah, it scared the living shit out of me.  I was alone just yelling loudly out loud in my boat.  But now I know Plum Gut. 
[02:43:00]  I just know it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you become a customer.  Now it's easy for you.  It's like K-Porn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For you, it's, you know.  You want to take a nice spin around there and fucking buy Somalia?  Yeah.  What does a fucking, what does a chart have on it?  Like how do you, if it's cloudy, how do you look at a chart and make any sense out of it?  It's just water.  Well, the clouds, but the clouds don't.  You're not, you're looking at the water.  You're not looking at the water.  You're not, I'm saying, look, what does that tell you though?  I'm saying the stars.  Oh, the charts are not stars.  The charts are, what the chart shows you, because the water's all different depths. 
[02:43:30]  You can be out in open water and it's only one foot deep and you can't boat there.  So there's all kinds of contours to the bottom of the, what you're looking at on the chart  really is what the, is under the surface.  What it looks like without water.  But how do you know that when you're in the, on the boat?  How do you know what looks like under what you're doing?  Because, well, first you have to, you use landmarks and certain references, although you can't  tell distances on the water.  Everything looks different.  But you use a compass and there's, there's marker buoys, you know, usually sometimes they, 
[02:44:00]  they have gaps where you're just kind of fucked and you just, there are places where you're  like, you know, you have binoculars and you're just have, you're trying to see a little green  light.  There's green and red buoys that mark the shipping channels of all the water anywhere.  You have a GPS navigation where it shows like where you're headed.  It shows your little icon.  And so you can navigate like that through some of the, uh, tighter things that aren't marked. 
[02:44:30]  Yes.  But then there's all these tricky things like the compass on the navigation.  It doesn't show true North.  It shows magnetic.  It shows all this kind of shit.  So you have to actually look and find, and sometimes binoculars, you're trying to look  through them and you're both slamming.  Oh yeah.  Binoculars are really, now you're also magnifying the motions and getting seasick.  Yeah, exactly.  So sometimes you just go, I'm just going to go in this direction on the compass until  something new gets revealed.  Wow. 
[02:45:00]  Until I learn something.  I want to take this phone call.  This guy has a hell of a story.  Dan in Maine.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  How you doing guys?  Good.  I've got a story to add, given the location and the topic you guys are on today.  We're bringing a wooden fishing boat, about 80 feet long, back from Newport News, Virginia,  up the coast.  We're running a heading of about 69 degrees.  And, uh, we got run over by a tanker 24 miles off Long Island.  The tanker was coming down the coast, coming, uh, south. 
[02:45:30]  And, uh, as it turned out, it was on autopilot.  There was nobody up on the bridge of the ship.  And, uh, they didn't see us.  And, uh, we had no communication with them, so we just held our heading.  Uh, they cut the stern of our boat off clean and kept on going.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Run over by an oil tanker.  It was on four in the morning.  And, uh...  You just set your boat on fire and just sink beneath the waves and give up?  What a fucking...  Good thing you didn't get out of its way. 
[02:46:00]  Just sat there and played chicken and lost...  What a terrible sailor you are.  Why didn't you have time to get out of the way?  I don't know how that works.  I'm going to fucking crisp him with a champagne bottle, you idiot.  He's on a sailboat.  I mean, he's supposed to have the right of way if you're on your sail.  That's good.  That's what your fucking goody-two-shoe rules get you.  Hey, I'll tell someone.  Fucking sternless.  That wasn't by oil.  That was a right, rotten thing to do.  Right, right.  So, what'd you do? 
[02:46:30]  He's already told us twice underneath our talk.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, exactly.  And 500 times the party.  By the time I lost my stern, yes, cocksucker, I'm your wife.  What happened, sir?  Fast.  The boat sunk in about five minutes, and we got everybody off the boat.  I'm going over a lot of the details.  And sharks come cruising. 
[02:47:00]  Exactly, but it's a way.  Ships sub slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief.  Not one came out.  Yes, yes, yes.  The year 1945.  I'll never call the Opian Anthony show again, Chief.  So, how many people were on this boat?  Obviously, they consider this fucking vessel coming a blessing.  There was four of us.  Okay.  And you're all in the water.  Then what happened?  Uh, we were in the water for a little bit. 
[02:47:30]  One of the guys didn't want to jump off.  He didn't know how to swim.  Finally went over, got him.  The boat sunk, disappeared.  Uh, there was a boat coming up the coast about an hour later.  Uh, we had one flare left.  We were all bobbing in the water.  We didn't have a, uh, uh, good life raft.  We were just kind of a half-inflated old rubber raft.  Uh, not prepared.  Fuck, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  How many miles off the coast?  We were exactly 24 miles off Long Island.  No, you should have swum.  Where were you?  Swimmed. 
[02:48:00]  You were in the ocean?  Correct.  Oh, man.  I would have lost my fucking mind.  24 miles out, they don't give a fuck.  No.  Those guys.  Yeah, uh, we just had, the reason we held our course is because you don't think somebody,  you figure it's going to be a port-to-port passing.  This guy's going his direction.  He turned at the last, you know, at the last minute.  When you can't communicate with him, you're not exactly sure what he's doing.  So, uh...  It's really, when you see the big boats, they grow unbelievably fast. 
[02:48:30]  It's unbelievable.  Because you can't judge size.  I mean, you really, on a boat like his, a wooden sailboat, you know, you probably didn't have radar.  If you have radar, which is hard to read anyway, you can tell.  Like, something looks like it's, you know, right there, and you look on radar, it's actually, like, three miles away.  Uh-huh.  You can't tell, but all of a sudden, before you know it, this fucking thing is right on top of me.  Wow.  Well, you have a tough time listening, sir.  Yeah, I hope your friend Herbie Robinson from Cleveland's okay.  The baseball player. 
[02:49:00]  No.  I don't think he's okay.  Yes.  Bobbed up like a top.  Yeah.  Upended.  It's been bitten in half.  It's been bitten in half.  Sir.  So when did the big old PBY come down and save you?  Yeah, it was about an hour.  We were in the water about an hour.  The water was about 40 degrees.  That's not too bad.  So we had three players.  Only one of them worked.  He'd come over and pull us out of the water.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  What shitty safety equipment this guy has. 
[02:49:30]  Exactly.  Couldn't even tie a sheep shank.  You know, we brought the boat down and, uh, we're bringing it back.  You wanted shorts.  It's been a while since I had to pass basic semen ship.  Semen ship?  Yeah.  It's been a while since I had to pass basic semen ship.  I hope you sang Lady of Spain as they were loading up that fucking...  Don't have to take this abuse much longer.  All right, Dan.  We heard some of your stories.  We heard most of your amazing stories. 
[02:50:00]  Exactly.  It's incredible.  You were with some people in the water and the fucking Valdez came by and, you know...  Everybody, yeah.  Everybody, everybody fucking died.  All right.  This guy wants you to subscribe to Sirius for the weather.  It saved him many times on the open ocean.  Yeah, well, that's when the signal works.  All right.  So long.  All right, Dan.  All right.  Good luck.  I don't give myself a bomb voyage.  Keep your business on the moon.  Exactly.  But 24 miles out.  Yeah.  24 miles out going in the water.  That would fucking scare the shit out of me.  Then he sees receipts around the house.  His wife paid somebody to fucking steal that ship into him. 
[02:50:30]  Hon, did you hire an oil tanker?  That's a long story.  Fucking boring.  Fucking oil tanker.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  They are very big and there's nobody on them looking around.  No one's looking...  Yeah, when you see those big cargo ships, it's not like someone's like,  I'm going to hang out on the rail...  No.  Like a cruise ship.  Yeah.  This fucking conga line to fucking...  He also was too close to the shipping channel.  Yes.  There's channels.  The shipping...  There's roads.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like standing in the middle of the highway.  Yeah.  It's like a guy standing in the middle of the highway and going, 
[02:51:00]  I don't know what happened.  I can't believe I got hit by a car.  Right, right.  And again, that stupid fucking Robert Redford movie.  He was very close to the shipping lane.  Yes, he was trying to get himself in the shipping lane.  He had a shot at three ships.  Yes.  And he didn't even try to hail one.  Really?  It was half-assed.  Gave no fucking attempt.  Just...  This sounds annoying.  God damn it.  And there's no talking.  He yells fuck once.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Doesn't have an air horn.  Doesn't have...  Yeah.  Something, right? 
[02:51:30]  Fuck you.  Right.  Fuck you.  His dumb safety equipment.  He bangs his head.  He's not even careful.  What else has been up, Louie?  Yeah.  How's Seinfeld to hang out with when he's not filming?  He's a good guy.  I'm fascinated by that guy.  He's a good guy.  He seems like a good guy.  More than I've...  I've heard stories over the years, but when I'm watching this thing, it seems like he's  all right.  He has a little edge to him.  He loves comedy and he's got...  He's got kids and he loves comedy.  He's a very simple guy.  Right.  Did you brag about your TV show?  Say, huh? 
[02:52:00]  I got a good TV.  To the guy who's got $600 million in an ashtray at home?  And 20 years later, it's still like the number one syndicate.  It never, never will be eclipsed.  It's on five times a day.  Yeah.  I've been working my entire life.  I would still never even do a 10 to 20.  Yeah.  Well, let's see him build something from the ground up.  There you go.  There you go.  $600 million.  You hire a guy like me.  Regular Joe.  And he just wants to get coffee.  That's all he wants.  That's really...  That's all he wants.  They don't care.  It's amazing you can do that.  To be able to just like, I'm going to grab one of my Porsches and just fucking... 
[02:52:30]  One of the episodes, he talks about his agent and how his agent's frustrated by him.  I'm sure.  Because he's like, you're doing a web series.  You know what you could be doing?  And Jerry's like, this is what I want to do.  Get it already.  Yeah, I did that.  How do you fucking...  Yeah, he can't even do another TV show like on television.  Once you did that, you know?  Yeah, that's why.  Why go down that road again?  Yeah.  You've already been so far down that road.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like Buzz Aldrin getting on a plane and going to L.A. and going, hey, look what I did. 
[02:53:00]  He also talks about how bored he was doing it by the end of it because it was so easy to do.  Yeah.  Creatively, he was out of his mind bored.  You go to his studio every day.  Yeah, sitcoms in L.A. especially.  That's a very sort of cut from a cloth life, you know?  Right, yeah.  And you know you're doing the same exact life that Dick Van Dyke did.  Oh, shit.  I think it gets to feel like...  You start thinking about it.  You see your own death pretty fast.  Start thinking about it, right.  Good point.  What am I doing?  I only did... 
[02:53:30]  I mean, I had a sitcom for, you know, part of a year.  Yeah.  And I could see where it would be like, this could...  You could get old doing this.  You could feel really...  Yeah, yeah.  And then get cut off.  Yeah.  And you see somebody who's out in the world and you're like, hey, what's going on out there?  Oh, it's great.  I'm taking a sailboat around the world.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a lot of safety equipment.  Yeah, exactly.  Hopefully the fucking life of Pi will call back.  It's a great story.  That clip of you describing the joke, the fishing, ice fishing joke. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Finally hearing the end of the joke was...  Yeah, it took a shit on the ice.  It took a shit on the ice.  I thought it was going to be a little more profound than that.  I think a lot of people did.  It never really added up.  And I told...  There is a scene towards the end of the movie where they call...  I don't know if you saw the movie.  You saw it.  When they call Christian Bale in and he says, I don't know where the money is.  And they're playing this kind of game.  Uh-huh.  And I'm in the room.  I've got like one line where I go, just go home. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  To Bradley Cooper.  There was a version that we shot for a whole day of me standing up and making this big...  And finishing the ice fishing story.  Finishing the joke.  Saying, fuck you, Christian Bale.  And taking Bradley Cooper under my arm and saying, come on, I'll take you home.  Like it was this big, brave thing that I did.  Yeah.  So for a whole day, he kept throwing alternate and different versions at me.  And I had to do...  And I'm like...  And I wasn't up to it.  Yeah.  I'm not that good.  And I'm not that important in the movie. 
[02:55:00]  So he tried to get...  I was trying it.  And look at Christian Bale and these people were looking at me.  And it's getting sweaty.  Like you can smell everybody in the room.  Like it got really...  It was long into the night.  And I kept trying this version.  And, you know, it's not in the movie.  Yeah.  But that's where the ice fishing story was supposed to be ended there.  I thought that he had actually guessed it.  And you were so annoyed at him, you wouldn't give him credit for it.  Like that's how it came off to me.  Like he got it.  And then you were like, no.  Like you were just fucking annoyed that he got it.  Yeah.  The whole bit was that I kept moving the goal post of the thing. 
[02:55:30]  Like, you know, it's about your brother.  No, it's not about that.  I mean, that was the bit we decided when we started doing it.  Was that I'd keep changing what it was meant.  He could never figure it out.  But then the end, I was there for an ADR for, you know, when you do recording of your voice for fixing stuff.  And they had found that scene that I think was out of the movie for a while of me in the hallway with him.  And he says, my brother died.  And I go, my brother died a different way.  Right.  And he decided that's just, that's how to end it.  Just let that be the end of it. 
[02:56:00]  Just let it sit there.  Yeah.  Congratulations, American Hustle.  Yeah.  It was fun.  It was a lot of fun.  That was a good one.  That was a really good movie, too.  And what's his name?  Just that little impression of you on the couch.  Just fucking...  Yeah, I didn't see that until I saw the movie.  I had no idea.  It's so funny, man.  I was not in the room, so I didn't know.  He's just...  I was fucking laughing my ass over that one.  Yeah.  That was fun.  Goddamn.  What other...  What are you working on?  I got this movie that I'm putting on my website tomorrow.  Yes.  Yes.  So starting at noon, you can buy it.  It's called Tomorrow Night.  And it's a feature-length movie I made. 
[02:56:30]  It went to Sundance and a bunch of festivals when I was 28.  Jesus.  Do you look at it now and think like, oh my God.  Yeah, I was shocked when I watched it.  Like, oh, what was I thinking?  Yes.  That's exactly right.  Really?  Yes.  It's pretty fucked up.  Yeah.  It's just...  I mean, it's a weird movie.  It's got a little heart to it.  And it's funny, because like J.B. Smoove, it's the first thing he ever did.  Because he was just starting as a stand-up, and I was about to start making the movie,  and I saw him at the comic strip.  And I went home and wrote a part for him, because he was so funny. 
[02:57:00]  So J.B. is great in it, and Steve Carell is funny in it.  And, you know, Rick Shapiro has a big part in it, too.  What year is it to him?  Rick Shapiro is in drag in the movie.  He plays the old lady.  Jesus.  Wow, man.  98.  Okay.  98.  16 years ago.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, and it's been under my bed all this time.  Conan's in it for a minute.  Like, he's in it as himself.  Wow.  And, yeah, it's a weird movie, but it is like, there's an old lady in it. 
[02:57:30]  Like, one of the main characters is an old lady.  And people keep saying to her, you're very, very old.  And I'm like, why did I do it?  It's kind of mean.  Like, it's mean.  It's mean.  Yeah.  Like, I wouldn't make that movie now.  But it's, you know, it's a product.  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of cool.  It's fun.  We'll check it out.  Are there any technical things in it that you look at and go, oh, I would just definitely  do that different.  Well, we shot it in black and white film and on reversal film, which is tricky to expose. 
[02:58:00]  So there's a few scenes that are very blown out.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  But I like the way we photographed.  All the people that I worked with are now on my show.  I mean, the crew that I assembled to do that movie.  Right.  I do my show with all the same people.  Is that out of loyalty?  No, because they were great.  Loyalty, or is it just they were good?  I wouldn't hang on to anybody.  If they suck, fuck them.  Get out of here.  That's good for a year.  I'm loyal for a year.  That's what you get.  But no, I've been with Amy Silver, the production designer of my show, and Paul Kessner, the 
[02:58:30]  director of photography.  We all started on that movie.  When's the next season starting?  In the summer?  May.  May.  Oh, wow.  We're almost there.  Wow.  I remember when you were like, man, I'm taking some time off.  I'm taking a year off.  And that time off is done.  Gone.  It's pretty much done.  It sounds like you took advantage of it, though.  I did.  Living on a boat.  A great summer.  Yeah.  But now I'm back at work.  We made a hurricane for the show.  We created a whole hurricane.  It's crazy.  Really?  It's the hardest thing I ever shot.  Can you explain?  It looks real. 
[02:59:00]  You're in wind and water.  Well, we kind of recreated what happened to Sandy, but it's more exaggerated.  It's kind of crazy what happened.  Oh, okay.  Can you explain how you created a hurricane?  Well, it all comes down to what exactly you're going to see in every shot.  So it's the only time I ever storyboarded, like drew pictures of what I wanted to see.  But we use rain machines, which you just plug into a fire extinguisher.  But we did it in the winter.  So I was getting rained on.  Cold.  Yeah, like 20 degrees. 
[02:59:30]  Jesus.  And we shot on a stage, but the water's coming in from a hydrant outside, and it was literally  like 10 degrees outside.  Yeah.  We couldn't stop the water running because it would freeze.  Right.  And you have like what?  So I have water being, like gushing onto my head that's right about to freeze.  That's like, holy shit.  And it literally, you know, when something's so cold that it hurts, my whole body, after  every take, I couldn't move my whole body.  Wow.  It was the hardest thing I ever did.  Wow.  And then we have wind machines, and we have this big tub of water with a car sloshing 
[03:00:00]  around in it, and it was crazy.  Are you yelling?  Do you have to yell?  Yeah, you have to yell when things aren't loud.  People always do that when, like, there's a hurricane scene.  It's a hurricane!  We're going to try to seek some shelter!  Actually, there's a guy in one scene who's yelling, there's a hurricane!  I can't hear you because it's a hurricane!  Just in case you don't get it, that's probably a good thing.  That's right.  Let the audience know.  There's one scene, the last thing that actually that we shot, there's a scene where I'm on 
[03:00:30]  a street, and I'm rescuing somebody during the hurricane, and we built a city street  like, you know, on a stage.  Oh, wow.  So it's, and it looks real, but I realize there's nobody else around except for me and  the characters.  So I wanted a big guy in his underwear to run through the, I'm giving away a lot, but  so I called Jay Oakerson, and I said, where are you right now? 
[03:01:00]  And he said, Indianapolis, so he couldn't do it.  Like, we were shooting in an hour.  Yeah.  And then I, my PA found this kid, Adrian, who's a comedian.  I don't know his last name, but he's, he's in American Hustle for a second.  Okay.  And so he, I called him, and he lives in the Bronx, and I said, can you come now?  So he ran down and he did it.  But I had him yelling all this different shit, and at one point I was going to have, he's  just yelling, and I was going to have him yell, Anthony, because of you.  Anthony!  And I didn't do that when I forgot to.  By the way, here's the joy in that story. 
[03:01:30]  Here's the nugget.  Big, dumb Jay Oakerson missed a shot to be on Louie because he was fucking middling  in Indianapolis.  I think we've got to take another break.  We go to 1030 now.  You sticking around?  That's great, man.  A couple more minutes.  A couple more minutes?  All right.  We'll finish on it.  I have a big announcement I have to make.  Right now you want to do it, Jimmy?  Let's do it.  Jimmy!  I have two sold-out shows at the Borgata.  The third one's on sale, the late show.  DC Improv, 6th to 8th of February, and February 28th. 
[03:02:00]  Pittsburgh, Carnegie Music Hall.  I couldn't repeat that back to you if you paid me a million dollars.  And I would if you could.  Right out.  I'd be double-plugging.  In my ear and out my asshole.  Well, you're missing a lot of laughs, and I should have went in the other way.  Start through the asshole, end up in the ear.  It's a home run for me.  Hey, we're Louis C.K. today.  He's got a new movie that he did back in 1998 coming out tomorrow on his website. 
[03:02:30]  Louis C.K.com, I think?  Yes, sir.  Or .net.  They both...  Or .net.  So check it out.  A lot of people you know and love in this movie from 1998.  Mirrors.  Yes.  Very cool.  Yeah.  And the show comes back in May, and the personal life is good?  Yeah, my kids are middle school, one of them, and the other one is, you know, third grade.  I get advice from you when you come in. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  My kid is finally in school.  He's three and a half, doing that pre-pre-pre-crap.  But they don't celebrate holidays.  They don't?  No.  What school?  What's the school?  I'd rather not say officially.  Oh, no, of course.  But is it a private school or a public school?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they can't even, like, they can't even bring gifts into the teachers.  Because then other kids will feel, like, left out because they...  I can't afford the gift, so the teacher will like the other kid better than me.  That's what they think is good.  Yeah.  So there's always that stuff.  I mean, my kids go to public school, and there was some controversy where the teacher 
[03:03:30]  gave another teacher a gift, and it's their friends.  And one of the...  Because the teacher had...  Teacher number one had a kid in teacher number two's class.  Right.  And so she gave her...  But they were, like, best friends also.  Right.  She gave her a present, and one of the parents was like,  Wait a minute, you're not supposed to give...  Preferential treatments.  And so she...  This is what drove me crazy.  A parent, anonymously, of course, because the parent gets to be anonymous, 
[03:04:00]  filed a grievance with the school board and put this teacher's job in jeopardy.  And this teacher...  This is one thing I tried to say to these people is, you know, the teacher's been there  for 25 years.  Like, there's teachers in our school who have been taught by this teacher.  We're passing through.  When you're in a school, you're passing through.  It's not...  Every parent's think that they can fucking decide...  Like, everything is about their kid.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the school has its own life.  It's a thing. 
[03:04:30]  And they've been...  They're responsible for the youth of the city.  Sure.  In waves.  You're just one fucking wave.  Yeah.  So, if you don't like it, just wait until you have another teacher next year.  Right.  You know?  But people that want to exact, you know, change in their...  Punishment.  You know?  Well, this is what I think should be.  Yeah, well, you're one fucking person.  And your kid is one kid in one class in one year of that one school.  People don't think that way.  They're very self-centered and think, you know, the world revolves around them. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  That's what I found myself saying to a lot of parents and stuff.  People, when they complain about stuff, is like, I understand why you're angry about  that, but I don't believe you're owed a remedy.  Oh, bravo.  To me, I wish, like, the president, the government would say this to people all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  I know that's frustrating for you, and that's a real grievance from your point of view, but  I don't believe that you are owed a remedy by anybody else.  That's too bad. 
[03:05:30]  Good luck.  It's driving us.  Like, Halloween, no costumes.  A memo came out.  A friendly reminder that this school, you know, you do not go to school with a costume on.  Three and a half year olds for Halloween.  Yeah.  So we're like, all right, you're not going to school that day.  That sounds like a high-minded private school.  Maybe we fucking blew it with our choice.  That's what I'm starting to think.  None of this right now matters.  Preschool.  It's a decent school in general.  Yeah, it's just somewhere for your kid to start. 
[03:06:00]  They used to call, like, they used to have leader for the day.  Yeah.  And some parent, like you said, complained.  Some anonymous parent that you don't even get to see their face years ago.  So now he's a host.  He hosts for the day.  That's better?  That's what I'm saying.  And what's the difference?  We'd like it to be gayer.  Right.  Leader is very butch.  Because saying leader gives the wrong impression.  And our whole take on this on the show, because we're obsessed with this shit, is like, then 
[03:06:30]  the kids get in the real world, and it's important to be a leader and stand out.  Sometimes, yeah.  Sometimes, right.  Whatever.  I mean, it's part of it.  Or a good host.  Or...  I still want to be a good host.  Sure.  I think that's a good thing for the kid.  Yeah.  But to baby these kids and then just throw them in the real world, what are we doing for  them again?  Well, it's people...  It's very narcissistic, because people think that if they can make the day in the school  their ideal, they're not looking at the kid at all.  They just assume all of society will now change because we're doing this little thing here. 
[03:07:00]  Well, they don't even think that far.  They're just that myopic.  They're like, this is what I want my kid.  No, they don't.  Yeah.  They don't.  I was driving in this morning, and it always astounds me when somebody's in the left lane  and there's nobody in front of them.  It's a wide open highway.  Behind them, a fucking parade of cars that are one foot off of each other's bumpers.  Everyone beyond pissed off.  It's harder not to notice that that's going on than to just... 
[03:07:30]  And then cars are going, whoa, whoa, whoa, around them and cutting them off, and they're  just looking straight at it.  One after another, and they still don't get it.  They don't see anything.  That astounds you, but what astounds them is why you're yelling deleted scenes from Django  out the window.  Well, Pete, I was in a car with Nick DiPaolo once, driving from...  Oh, that's got to be a treat.  This is not going to be a courteous story.  Yeah.  No, you wouldn't believe how calm and patient he was. 
[03:08:00]  End of story.  No, every time that he was stuck behind somebody, he would flash his high beams and say, get  the fuck out of the road.  And then whenever somebody was behind him flashing their high beams, he'd be like, fuck you,  I'm doing the fucking speed limit, I'm obeying the law, fuck you, I have a right to be in  this lane.  Yeah, yeah.  But same guy.  Yeah, yeah, I realize that isn't the thing to do.  And if somebody comes up behind me, I'm always scanning the old mirrors, I'll pull over.  Right.  If someone wants to do 100 miles an hour, why do I give a shit? 
[03:08:30]  Get out of the way.  I want the speed limit, fuck you.  Do what you want.  With Nick DiPaolo, it's a real case of, hooray for me, to hell with you.  That's a really elegant way of putting it.  My grandmother used to say that when somebody was speed by her, she absolutely would.  Oh, wow.  Jam a couple of fingers in and fucking change her to it.  There's also the police by proxy, the pseudo-police people that think they're going to enforce  the law if there's a traffic jam.  And I decide I want to get on the shoulder and fucking tear up there and pass all this 
[03:09:00]  traffic.  You get the guy that moves over to block it.  What use is that?  Right.  Why are you fucking blocking?  I'm willing to take the gamble that I'm going to get fucking pulled over and get a huge ticket.  I'm willing to take that gamble.  Just stay out of my fucking way.  Yeah.  You really do that?  We're trying to be on your side, but it's such a scumbag move. 
[03:09:30]  Hey, it's a scumbag move, but I'm willing to do it.  That's a great slogan.  It's a scumbag move, but I'm willing to do it.  That should be on a bumper sticker for you.  On a van, yeah, in front of a scooter.  Well, you know, as amazed as you are by the people that sit in the left lane and do that,  I'm amazed by the overwhelming flow and peace of traffic.  It really is astounding when you think there's kind of nothing in between us and how...  It's unbelievable. 
[03:10:00]  ...less than often they really do bang together.  Yeah, people aren't, like, just banging into the next car, climbing in the window and eating  everybody, taking whatever they can.  One guy doing five miles an hour, one doing 150.  Yeah, I don't know why it's not worth it.  There should be so many more accidents every day.  It really is.  Just kind of...  And deliberate carnage.  Right, right, right.  And murder.  Just by how impatient we are and how terrible we are to each other, you would think, with  these giant fucking transformers that we're driving around.  Even, like, tough-looking people, people that look like criminals, like, on purpose, who 
[03:10:30]  have, like, you know, fake bullet holes in the back window, like, you know, people  that are like, I am a criminal, and I think it's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  But they're, they're signaling, they're checking their mirrors, they're staying the heck out  of the HOV lane if they're not, if they don't belong in it.  Hey, you see them, they're in the lane when it turns to HOV, and oh, blinker off!  I should, you know, there's only one of them.  Three teardrop tattoos, but I better, you know, come to a full stop.  Ten and two, ten and two, though.  I did, I did another move coming off of the parkway onto Old Country Road. 
[03:11:00]  They got that, like, cloverleaf off-ramp thing, and it was packed.  And, uh, I just went on the grass and cut completely across the cloverleaf and popped  up where the traffic was going onto Old Country Road, and just, like, and then I just, I,  like, put my hand out, like, hey, you, I'm getting in here.  Right.  And then I just go in, and I was off.  I used to drive with him.  Amazing.  I've never seen anyone pull more moves than Anthony. 
[03:11:30]  When I do stuff like that, when I do, like...  Sidewalks?  Do you do sidewalks?  No, I've never done that.  He does sidewalks.  Whenever I've done things that I shouldn't be doing, and other people give me indignant  looks, I decide, I, like, own the fiction that there's an emergency.  Like, I just decide.  Because they don't know.  They don't know.  That I'm not, like, that my kid's not bleeding or something.  Right, right.  So I decide, my kid's bleeding, fuck you, you have no more.  You're right to judge me.  I never judge anyone making a move that could potentially get them killed or have a ticket.  Because I'm like, more power to you. 
[03:12:00]  Yep.  And in New York, you've got a lot of situations where, especially in, like, Queens and stuff,  there's a truck trying to back into a loading dock.  This will drive me fucking crazy.  Because they take forever.  I understand it's a difficult thing.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I could wheel that, whip that truck right in there.  But it takes a while.  And now I'm sitting there.  The first thing I'll do is look at cars parked on the side of the road and see if there's  an opening.  Then you go through there on the sidewalk, you drive a little way, and then you pop  back down around the truck. 
[03:12:30]  Sure.  And then there's people, though, that will, if there's a car parallel parking or a truck  backing in and we're in a line of cars that are waiting, you don't have to wait until  the truck is in the loading dock or the car's parked.  Go around it.  The second there's enough room.  Yeah, you go.  Go.  Why the fuck wait?  Oh, it's disturbing.  The thing is, being in traffic, you're trying to move.  You're moving at a higher than human speed.  Yes.  Which is easy to forget.  You're moving faster than your body is capable of moving. 
[03:13:00]  So when you have to slow down or stop, you're at a distorted level of anxiety.  I need to be moving.  You're through.  You're through with you.  And the moments that you're needing to wait for people to do a clumsy parking job are not  going to change your life at all.  You're going to just be waiting longer in the next red light.  That's called logic.  That's weird.  I've had people honk at me like it's a pedestrian, like honk, and then I've done this where then  I walk up to the net, then they honked at me, then they're sitting in a red light, and 
[03:13:30]  I'll walk up to their car and go, aren't you glad that you honked at me so you can get  here quicker?  You know what I tell them?  Because I've had cars do that, too, where it's like, I go, bam, move, and they're like,  good, fuck you, and then it stopped at a light, and he's like, see how far you got?  I say, I go, if you weren't in my way, I'd have made that fucking light.  That's usually not true.  So if the pedestrian wasn't in my way.  That's usually not true.  You need to learn how to wait in life, but it's hard to do when you've been moving at  a, I once was at a red light, I was on a motorcycle, and there, I was like, three cars back from 
[03:14:00]  the intersection, this is on the Upper West Side, and there was a truck, a guy in a truck  trying to get, he was trying to screw through the intersection, like, illegally, and a cab  was sitting, like, waiting to make a left turn, the cab was in the right place, and the  truck was trying to do something fucked up.  The cab did nothing, but the truck driver pulled up to the cab and spit on his window  and cursed at him, and everybody was like, what the fuck, and then the truck makes his 
[03:14:30]  left turn, and I watched him, and all I did was, I shook my head, just to myself, I just  shook my head, like, barely, like, oh, wow.  Like, work up another loogie for you?  And he saw it, and slammed on his brakes, and looked at me and said, you gotta fuck it,  started cursing at me, and he started getting out of his, he was going to fight me, maybe  kill me, maybe break my bones, maybe have himself killed, because I barely, barely shook 
[03:15:00]  my head.  Right.  So far, I'm 100% on his side.  I'm with the trucker.  And now, just last week, I'm driving one of the side streets, trying to get to the  Midtown Tunnel, and there's a bus, giant bus, stopped in the middle of the road, and I'm  looking now, because I instantly have to fucking know who's fucking this up.  And I look, and I notice that there's no one in front of the bus.  So the bus has stopped there for apparently no fucking reason, backing up traffic.  And this is going on and on and on. 
[03:15:30]  And there's a cab parked next to the bus, enough where, if the cab moved, everyone  could squeeze the cab, but the cab won't even fucking move.  So I'm getting livid at this point.  I get out of the vehicle.  I start walking, I walk up to the bus.  I walk up to the bus, and I bang on the door.  And he goes, he goes, where would you like me to go?  And points to a truck now, that's off where I couldn't see, double parked, unloading some  shit, and now the bus can't get through.  So I just look, and I just went, I don't care, move this vehicle! 
[03:16:00]  Did he laugh at you at that point?  No, no, and the guy with the truck, because he heard me banging on the door and yelling,  the guy that was double parked, so he got in his truck and moved enough to let the bus  move.  So everyone can move on.  But I'm walking back to my truck like, yeah, thank me, you motherfuckers, all that would  have just been sitting here.  Dude, the stress you give yourself on a daily basis, that's not good.  Exactly, you'll get somewhere fast when you're in the back of an ambulance. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  Fucking frightening.  Let me say hi there.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy, go ahead.  Yeah, I was on the highway last night, snowstormed his asshole in an SUV, blew past me, about  a mile down the road, he hit the center divider wall.  I pulled over, not to help him, but to laugh at him, as if I was all bloody, then bust it  up.  He was a fucking idiot, because he fell off and passed me.  So you had to rub it in.  Yeah, you should have just yelled at him when he sped by.  What are you, rushing into an accident or something?  You know, you want to let him have it?  Hey, hurry up and hurt your car. 
[03:17:00]  And here's the guy that blocks you on the shoulder thing.  Oh, really?  One of these guys.  Yeah, Andy in Connecticut.  Go ahead.  Hey, asshole.  Hey, you know, most I agree with most of your traffic and how assholes on the road.  However, here's the caveat.  Here's the asterisk.  Here it is.  I got to take umbrage with this one thing.  Problem?  Hey, listen.  You try to pass me to a breakdown lane on the right-hand side, I will block your ass every 
[03:17:30]  time.  Oh, go for it.  Why?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Why?  You're just adding to the problem?  Oh, he's getting married.  No, I'm not.  Oh, you're just...  Oh, he's right.  Okay, I know what you're saying.  When I go to merge back in, I'm making more traffic, right?  Right.  I'm the only one doing it.  You're not the only one.  Yes, I am.  I know you think you're God's gift to drive.  You're blocking me.  Now you're making me go in behind you where there isn't a spot.  Meanwhile, I'd be going and wait because there's always an asshole that's going to leave a lot 
[03:18:00]  of room between the two vehicles.  That's where I dart in.  Sneaking quick.  That's where I...  What about you, sir?  Because you compound the problem with you.  Your vigilante...  You did.  Attitude.  Lane patrolling.  Yeah.  All right, Louie, I agree with that, you know, so I shouldn't be doing it either, but  I cannot...  Yeah, it's old Paul Kersey of the fucking highway, that's right.  All right.  All right, sir, thank you.  He got in the lane, and he went on the shoulder, and he raped my wife and daughter. 
[03:18:30]  Now Matt's going to remind us of another thing you did.  Oh, really?  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Ant, do you remember that time Justin Bieber was on Good Morning America, and...  Oh, I want to fuck that kid.  He's a man now, right?  It's not...  I think he is.  He's 19.  Not funny.  You're all right.  He's 19.  I'm going to fuck him.  Twinkish.  And the cabbie was in front of Ant, and...  Do you know how he keeps his hair up like that?  It's my sperm.  Is it?  Your sperm?  I come on his hair every morning. 
[03:19:00]  It does a great job.  It's pretty stiff.  Sorry.  Go ahead, sir.  Sorry, Louie.  Don't be a deal.  And Ant, you physically rammed the cab, and you shoved...  It was Michael Bubl√©.  It was Michael Bubl√©.  It was Michael Bubl√©, right?  And I just...  Michael Bubl√© was leaving the Today Show.  Can we play that for Louie?  I was right in front of it, and there's a news clip of him coming out of...  Good morning, America, or whatever the fuck. 
[03:19:30]  Today Show or something like that.  I think it is in Today Show.  And there's a video of him signing autographs, and the paparazzi's taking pictures, and all  you hear is my horn going,  Man!  And then you hear me yell,  You piece of shit!  Right.  Because here's what happened.  A guy jumped out of his car and just left the car in the middle of the road with a camera  to get pictures and stuff of Michael Bubl√©.  That's awesome.  And I just laid on the horn and wouldn't stop, and I just called him. 
[03:20:00]  And then I got up to his bumper with mine and just...  I just started pushing his car out of the way, and he's like,  Hey, hey, hey!  And then he got in his vehicle and put it in gear, and then I got around him.  But the last shot is you taking off in the escalates.  You need to get inside the margins, because you're going to get in trouble.  I love it.  Oh, it's so much fun.  You're not quite in control of yourself.  You don't think?  Something...  You plus another factor that's not in your control.  Right.  You're going to do some time if you're not careful. 
[03:20:30]  I know.  Most people that commit crimes didn't plan to do it that day.  Most people that end up in jail, it was a circumstance.  Right.  Plus their inability to control themselves.  Yeah.  You're going to be incarcerated.  Maybe I'll...  We just think it's going to happen.  We just think it's fun.  Just get inside the margins a little bit.  A little bit.  At least straddle the margins.  No, this is good for the radio show, though.  I love it.  Well, you still have plenty of stories to draw from.  Yeah.  It's not good, though.  No.  Well, I'm trying to educate these people. 
[03:21:00]  Well, what about when you shoot debris at other cars that did you wrong?  Tell Louie about that one, too.  No, that's a good one if somebody's...  Driving gravel and...  In the lane.  Yeah.  Or just the side of the highway.  All that shit is just hanging out.  They got those...  They got those...  Yeah.  Like ditches, little notches...  Wake up this thing.  ...in the road.  And if somebody's going too slow in the left lane and I pass them, if you put your wheels  in those, they load up with rocks.  Right.  And your tire literally sucks the rocks out and blasts it at them. 
[03:21:30]  You're like a poor James Bond guy.  Yes.  It's like I need an oil slick and a smoke screen.  Here's the Michael Buble clip.  I don't know if it'll do...  Is this the one?  I don't know if it'll do it justice, but you might hear it.  Let me...  You can hear it in the background.  Yeah.  I hear the horn.  That's it.  Three dollars on eBay.  You can't hear him in person, right?  I think you can. 
[03:22:00]  Right when the horn stops, I yell it.  It's one.  One guy.  Hey, shithead!  Hey, shithead!  Yes, I heard it.  Hey, shithead!  That's amazing.  Yeah, I was very angry.  That's a relentless word.  Oh, I just...  He pissed me off so bad.  He was trying to take video.  This might be his video.  How weird is that?  That's a nightmare.  Your whole life is a combination of Barfly and Bobby Deerfield. 
[03:22:30]  I live a little too close to one of the tunnels.  Oh, wow, yeah.  And like on Friday nights or Saturday nights when everybody's trying to...  If I'm sleeping at three in the morning and everybody's trying to get out of the city, there's often somebody leaning on a horn.  And it's a half a block from me, but there's been a few times I've actually sat up in bed and contemplated, I'm going to fucking put on my pants and... 
[03:23:00]  Bundle up.  Bundle up.  And go and find that car and I'm going to fucking hurt somebody.  And pull out one of the big knives from the cutlery set and stab them.  Yeah.  I went after these kids once.  The one...  I think that's most have ever scared another person.  I was coming home and there was these college kids, because there's some nightclubs in my area.  These college-looking kids, you know, clean cut, out for a party night.  Sure.  And they were...  One of them was down in the stoop of my neighbor's house, pissing on... 
[03:23:30]  Oh, man, yeah.  But he's pissing on somebody, because people live...  That's like a basement apartment.  He's just pissing on someone's front door and on their stoop.  It's their house.  This kid, yeah.  That's where they live.  And I came up behind him and I said, you're not fucking pissing on somebody's house right now.  And his friend was waiting for him.  And the kid quickly did his pants up.  And they were so scared.  I think from their point of view, they're like these college kids.  Uh-huh.  And they're in scary New York. 
[03:24:00]  Right, right, right.  And they thought I was like...  They thought I was like black, basically.  Because I'm in New York City.  And they're like, sir, we're very sorry.  And I go, that's a person's fucking house.  You're an adult, you piece of shit.  Since you saw that they were scared, you jumped on it.  Why does someone have to tell you not to...  What if I pissed on your fucking house?  You fucking fuck...  What kind of a person are you?  I just kept screaming.  Nice.  That's my neighbor's fucking house.  We're very sorry.  We didn't know.  You didn't know what. 
[03:24:30]  That you're pissing on someone's front fucking door.  You fucking animal.  Because I see it all the time.  Right, right.  So I'm yelling at about a thousand people.  Now let me ask you this.  What would you have said if you turned around and said, fuck you, old man?  I would have been like, go ahead, I'm sorry.  I was never going to get violent.  Right, right, right.  Not worth that.  Keith, the cop used to, when he was patrolling and saw anybody pissing, he'd go up behind him  real kind of quiet and just push his foot on their ass and push them so they'd piss all 
[03:25:00]  over themselves.  That's great.  That's great.  And then they see it's a cop and they can't do anything.  Yeah, because then they get pissed, turn around, and it's a fucking cop, so you can't  do anything.  Anyway, you just got to fucking piss on yourself.  Nick DiPaolo had a friend who was a Miami vice cop, and he was a plainclothes detective,  and he carried a piece everywhere.  Yeah.  And he was a really rageful guy.  Oh, shit.  So he was like you in traffic, but he would, if somebody pissed him off a little bit, then 
[03:25:30]  he'd get in a game of provoking them, and he'd keep provoking and provoking until they  did something where he could stop his car and fucking smash their window in with his  weapon and arrest them.  He did it all the time.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  I get to work every day with, okay, who did you arrest today?  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Because he slightly cut you off, so you cut him off, flipped him off until you did something,  and then, yeah.  Wow.  Woo!  That's great.  That guy's a fucking hero. 
[03:26:00]  That guy's a fucking hero.  That's an animal.  That's a national treasure.  All right.  We got to get Louie out.  Yeah.  Well, look at the time.  So long, fellas.  Thank you.  Louie, thanks for coming in, man.  It's so rude.  Oh, you know, I drop my kid off.  I write Jimmy Norton.  I say, you know, I say, you're on the air, I ask him.  Yes.  He writes back, sure we are.  And then we, of course, we wrote a few saucy things.  Oh.  We're comedians.  Read that.  Yeah.  That's the F word a couple of times.  They're just throwing barbs at each other, you know.  Hey, bet you look like you fell through an awning or something.  Yeah.  Good one.  I was like, yeah, how's your ugly mug doing you? 
[03:26:30]  Oh, fuck.  Hey, having fun, tell your face, back and forth.  Just, you wouldn't believe it.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of waltz.  You would put a hair on your ends.  What?  Yeah.  I got an idea for your show.  Yeah, a lot of stuff like that.  It's about some guy that talks to a college student about urinating, and the guy pisses  in the old guy's mouth.  Watch what you say.  He'll put it on his TV show.  That's so funny.  Oh, God.  Remember that?  We might get that. 
[03:27:00]  Hey, he's got a radio show.  Watch what you say.  Watch what you say.  You'll end up on his show.  I'm like, no, there's nothing you could say that will end up on the show.  Except for this right now.  Yes, except this right here.  Good example.  So, louisck.com and louisck.net.  Noon tomorrow, $5.  It's a very cheap amount to pay for a movie.  And, you know, it's the same as the other stuff I saw on my website.  You get the movie.  You can use it any way you want.  There's no digital restrictions.  Can we re-edit it?  Please don't pirate it, because then I can't release stuff like this anymore if you pirate 
[03:27:30]  it.  And we won't email you or bother you.  It's just very simple.  Cool.  And it's a movie you did in 1998.  1998.  So, that'll be very interesting.  Yeah.  It's at least $5 worth of fun.  All right.  That's fair enough.  At least.  It's worth it.  If you don't want to, then just pirate it later.  When it doesn't matter anymore.  Please don't.  Please don't do that.  Thank you.  Not immediately, please.  And, Jimmy?  I have Atlantic City.  One show left.  February 15th.  The late show.  10-30.  At the Borgata.  I'm going to that.  At the Borgata.  Yes.  I'm going both days.  Me, my whole family's going down there. 
[03:28:00]  We're going to have a pisser, as they say.  And he said, next Thursday through Saturday, February 6th through 8th, Jimmy will be at  the Washington, D.C. Improv Comedy Club.  Well, 6th and 7th.  8th is sold out.  Oh.  The 8th is sold out?  Yeah, 6th and 7th.  I bet you can still get tickets to the 8th.  Well, there might be.  A lot of those are going to get a reservation, so those are going to get canceled.  A couple hundred singles might pop up, you know, as they say.  My agent will say that.  When I look at the count, I'm like, but Pete, it says there's 400 tickets.  And then Friday, February 28th, at the Carnegie Music Hall.  Carnegie Music Hall. 
[03:28:30]  Not Carnegie Hall.  Let's be very clear.  Yeah.  Let's be crystal clear.  The fact that it's in Munn Hall, Pennsylvania.  How do you get to the Carnegie Hall?  Not go to Munn Hall.
