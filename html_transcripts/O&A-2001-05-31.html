<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a retrospective on their final day under their current contract with WNEW.  Opie and Anthony reminisced about past show personalities including Gary Wall, Pop-Tart Roger, Scott Herman, Spike, Tara ("that whore, that radio whore"), the eyepatch intern, Jesse ("a psycho mark"), and John Deentz, recounting various outrageous stunts like tampon changing, egg shootings, and numerous dice-related incidents.  Several staff members—Steve C., Dave (described as "very tense"), Cheryl (considering "a life of crime"), and J.B.—and callers phoned in to express their anxieties and emotions about the contract's end.  The near-firing of producer Rick was also discussed, with input from callers Greg and Big Bud Mendy (who boasted about driving around with a revealing sign).  Other callers included Stephanie (offering a movie night and "fool around"), and John, Opie's former boss from the Huntington Crescent Club, leading to a discussion about caddying, Casey Martin's golf cart controversy, and caddying costs.  The Bush twins' antics were also satirized.  Frequent guest Jay Moore called in, detailing his recent appearances (including a kiss with Kelly Ripa), and the conversation touched on Colleen Haskell's film role and Mrs. Green Thumbs.  The segment ended with Jay Moore doing a Howard Stern impression, followed by final comments from the hosts before a commercial break and the end of this section.  The segment also featured an advertisement for Pinnacle Monkeying Around, a sexual enhancement product, and numerous sexually suggestive and offensive jokes.

The next segment focused on the hosts' impending departure from WNEW due to contract disputes.  Listener Catherine worried about finding the show's future location, prompting jokes about smoke signals.  The potential for the news to break in the New York Post, and the role of Ron and Fez, was debated.  A caller, Mitchell, criticized the station's stance on free speech, after three years of listening.  The conversation then dramatically shifted with the unexpected arrival of frequent listener "Patty" at the studio.  The hosts joked about frisking her and betting on making her cry.  Patty, oblivious to their firing, read a letter praising the show and criticizing management. The hosts revealed they had been fired, a fact Patty initially refused to believe.  A lengthy, teasing exchange ensued, leaving Patty visibly upset.  Subsequent calls from listeners offered various perspectives on the hosts' three-year tenure.  The conversation veered into a discussion about the "Gay Disney" event in Orlando.  Gabe Marco, calling live from the event, described the scene, leading to a lengthy, crude, and sexually charged discussion with the hosts.

Comedian Rich Vos joined the studio, initiating a comedic roast with Jeffrey Ross, filled with insults and jokes targeting each other and other comedians.  This segment was interrupted by a heated argument, escalating into a physical altercation between Jeff Norris (in the studio) and Rich Voss, resulting in a brawl and damage to studio property.  Sam Levine was also present during this fight.

Following the fight, the show transitioned to a segment featuring Earl, a shy staff member, and his arranged date with Monique, a retired exotic dancer. This involved awkward interactions, jokes about Earl’s virginity, and plugs for Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed and Sacker 2.  The segment built towards a planned lap dance from Monique for Earl.  Jeffrey Ross made brief appearances throughout.

The final segment devolved into a chaotic, sexually explicit scene with Earl, Monique, and two additional women described as "retarded Laverne and Shirley,"  filled with lewd jokes, references to drug use, and nudity.  The women's appearance and behavior were the subject of offensive remarks.  Monique's lap dance for Earl was graphically described.  Jeffrey Ross made further brief appearances. The segment concluded with speculation about the show's future, hinting at the end of their contract.  The overall tone remained highly irreverent, vulgar, and sexually charged.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Radio is a commercial business, and you have to do what people want.  I don't want a trap.  We don't do traffic, we don't do weather, we do nothing.  Did you just sit here and chuckle again?  That's it. It's like the worst radio on the planet.  Yes, we know.  Opie and Anthony's show.  We're so lame.  I'm just explaining something.  Walk it off, dick. 
[00:00:30]  Walk it off, dick. 
[00:01:00]  Walk it off, dick.  Walk it off, dick.  A little contract.  Mm-hmm.  Here it is. 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  Day zero.  Day zero.  I remember the Gary Wall days.  I remember Pop-Tart Roger.  Seems like yesterday.  Scott Herman.  Hey, if you want to reminisce, we can reminisce all you want.  Ah, yeah.  Give me some sappy music, I'll reminisce.  Yeah.  Well, so here we are.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Baba Booey to you.  Oh, let me check my calendar. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, it's 1989.  Oh.  That's right.  And a happy Baba Booey to you, too.  Yeah.  I will remember you.  Pop-Tart Roger.  They're going to put you guys in front of a giant Pop-Tart and broadcast.  Let's not forget Spike kicking guys in the nuts. 
[00:02:30]  Where's Gary Harry?  How about Tara?  How about Tara?  That whore.  That radio whore, Tara.  Yes.  You can see her on many episodes of Howard's show.  That's right.  What a fine, fine three years it has been.  The road shows.  All the good times we've had over.  Scott Herman.  Remember we used to have meetings every other day in his office? 
[00:03:00]  And him and Gary Wall would just ditch us out relentlessly about how bad we were here.  All the awful things we were doing.  Southern guy.  Goddamn, thank God.  I thought that contract had never been.  I'm telling you, stick it up to you, boy.  Don't let your life pass you by.  Yeah, the idiot savant spaz. 
[00:03:30]  The idiot savant without that pesky savant thing.  I don't want to add in that savant.  No.  In recent history, the eyepatch intern.  And of course, Jesse.  Gak, gak, gak, psycho mark.  Started out bringing chicken to big fat Michael Lebranco.  Ended with the anal on the boss's couch. 
[00:04:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Let's not forget John Deentz with his capri pants.  Yes.  What a day.  A lot of people say that on instant feedback are crying right now.  They're weeping openly.  Be more funny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let's not forget the tampon changing.  Yes.  What a lot of fun we've had. 
[00:04:30]  I believe that was like the first time we got in trouble here in New York.  Dice.  Tampon changing.  The egg shooting.  And dice.  And dice.  And more dice.  Jesus Christ, enough dice.  Teared in my eye.  All right, day zero.  Okay.  Nice.  Nice.  Enough of a tribute.  Uh, Steve C., how you doing?  Good, Dylan.  Holding up, how's the pressure been on you and all of our other support staff? 
[00:05:00]  Immense, but wear it well, just like everybody else does.  Had a little meeting with Ron and Fez shortly before the show,  after they got off the air.  They're wishing us well in whatever endeavors we pursue.  Dave, how do you feel that we're having a tough time bringing you with us?  What do you mean, how do I feel about it?  Are you sad? Are you happy? Indifferent?  Not indifferent. Not indifferent.  Very tense.  Very tense.  Would like very much to beat the living ass out of a few people, but I'm not. 
[00:05:30]  The therapy has paid off, and I'm staying calm.  Very good.  There's a few dead children in my studio who have paid the price that a couple other people couldn't pay.  Other than that, fine.  Cheryl.  Cheryl.  Cheryl.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Jamaican Cheryl.  You're making me sad.  No.  Call me now.  Look in the cards. 
[00:06:00]  Tell me what we're going to do.  Guys, please don't leave.  Yeah.  We're not leaving New York.  You know, it's funny that I never knew the day would come when I'd be missing white guys.  There you go.  Hey, we love you, man.  You need my days.  You just make it easy for me.  Right.  And guys, please, I just wish you all the best, whatever you plan to do.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And stop playing that song, because you're making me cry.  I'm looking into a life of crime, Opie. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm thinking of going into a life of crime.  I'm looking into a life of crime, Opie.  I'm looking into a life of crime, Opie.  Okay.  Bye.  Thanks for being me.  I love you, guys.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Bye.  Bye.  J.B.  Hey, hey.  What's up, man?  How's it going?  Hey.  Well, I have just a direct question, and I'll try and work my way around it as best possible.  All right.  I want to know exactly what the repercussions would be had you mentioned a certain person's  name on the air, because I'm kind of putting together a little timeline slash chronicle 
[00:07:00]  of what's been going on the past year or two with you guys.  Yeah.  And, you know, I've never really understood, like, what would happen if you were to mention  a certain person's name on the air.  You mean if we said Howard Stern?  Sure.  Oh.  Well, nothing, I guess.  Okay.  Well, then, does this mean that you're going to go in a completely different direction  and maybe ship the show a different way?  We do our show.  That's it.  Incorporate new bits. 
[00:07:30]  Incorporate new bits.  Oh, I see what he's getting at.  Hey, whatever we deem good for this show, funny or anything else, we'll do.  As I see it, we have no restrictions.  Well, that's great.  I mean, it seems like you guys have been granted a whole new freedom to explore whatever  territories haven't been explored yet.  Am I correct?  Absolutely.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Have a good day, guys.  Bye.  You know what's funny?  I mean, we'll goof on and have fun with it today.  As we sit here, we have no effing idea. 
[00:08:00]  No clue.  What's going on?  We're going to be none.  None.  Yeah.  Day zero.  On day zero.  And it's funny because so many, like, air personalities before us have played this game  on their shows.  Yeah.  So it's to the point where, you know, the listeners don't buy that old gag.  I know.  But you read the message boards and stuff, too.  And, like, people just, I don't know.  They don't believe it. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  But I'm telling you, believe whatever you want.  We have no idea how this is going to pan out.  No clue whatsoever.  Read the little post thing today.  Yeah.  John Vannelli is, I guess we could say, quite accurate in his reporting.  Let's just say it that way.  Absolutely.  So for the people who are convinced they know exactly how this is going to turn out,  you know more than we do.  It might end up like you're saying. 
[00:09:00]  But right now, I don't know.  No clue.  I know today is the last day of our contract.  That's all we are absolutely sure of is the date on the contract.  And I won't be here tomorrow.  Anthony, will you be here tomorrow?  No.  As I see it, I don't think anything is getting solved tonight.  No.  We will.  We could honestly say no.  We will not be in tomorrow.  Rick, will you be here tomorrow?  No, but I will be appearing at the Kinko's. 
[00:09:30]  Kinko.  Ben?  Long weekend.  Right.  More beer.  More beer for us.  Yeah.  Beer more gooder.  Hey, are we going to draw straws for the Jäger machine?  Oh.  Yeah.  Who gets the Jäger machine?  Wow.  We should start throwing stuff out on the sidewalk today.  What?  Yeah.  We will kill whoever is not.  No, Steve.  Steve can't.  You've already won too much money.  Steve, we'll leave the Jäger Meister machine behind for you.  Appreciate it. 
[00:10:00]  So you can drown your sorrows.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That is what's going on.  Hey.  Hey.  That was a sweet skit you guys did yesterday.  Let you go around.  I know.  Oh, the Harry Carey and the Bob Murphy.  God damn, was that funny, man.  Jay was tearing it up as a Harry Carey.  Jay was on fire.  Yeah, he was definitely on fire.  I was saying also in the back after we got done with the show, it's one thing to be able  to just do the voice, which Jay was doing great, the Harry Carey voice, but to throw  in all that twisted, off-the-wall crap to a tee like he used to do it, it's just hysterical. 
[00:10:30]  Jay Moore tore it up yesterday.  He killed on TV this morning, too, with Kelly Ripa.  I was asleep, Opie.  I missed it.  You missed it?  He did really, really well.  Really well.  So it was a lot of fun.  I was dozing.  All right, Dennis.  Well, good luck with the air conditioning and the caddy.  Yeah, Opie going back to the Crescent Club in Huntington, and I actually should call Apollo  air conditioning back up and see if I got my old truck.  Maybe someone could lend me some snips until I could buy some new ones.  I think I got to call John Shobe. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, the golf row over there and see if I can, you know what I mean?  Get your job back?  Maybe get a couple loops.  Rudy, Tony, hook me up.  I'm going back to looping.  You're going back to looping?  I'm a pro-jack.  You're a looper.  The Dali Lama.  Shobe, I'm coming your way.  Give me a job for a while.  I'll wear my beeper like I used to wear so my boss could get in touch with me as I'm  out on my jet ski.  I won't be able to have a jet ski.  I'll be starting salary again at Apollo. 
[00:11:30]  Damn.  Yeah.  Make sure, guys, when you give me my Apollo air conditioning truck, please, one with the  trailer hitch.  You could do that for me.  Please.  They never noticed the trailer hitch, did they?  They noticed.  They weren't as stupid as...  You know what it was, though?  Here's the real deal.  We've talked about this.  You had a work van with a trailer hitch.  With a trailer hitch.  And it didn't come with the trailer hitch.  No, I installed it.  You had a trailer hitch installed on the work truck.  And any time I used to have to load up the truck in the morning when I would get there, 
[00:12:00]  most of the guys would back the truck up to the big garage door and load the stuff in.  I'd always pull it sideways and load through the side door so my trailer hitch wasn't facing  the thing.  But I wasn't kidding anybody.  They knew.  The thing was, with me when I was working back then, I wasn't the employee.  I was like a renegade kind of guy.  Like, if they needed something done in Queens and they didn't quite know what the job was,  they could send me with sheets of metal and I would make whatever need be made.  So I was valuable like that.  But in order to get that, they put up with me coming in late, me maybe driving the... 
[00:12:30]  I'm the Lorenzo Lamas of AC.  That was me.  Renegade.  And also, the how am I driving, if you see me doing something, call this number and then  you give a certain number that was also on there, like 688B or something like that, I  would turn the eights into threes with electrical tape and cover up the B. So even if they called,  it would just be like, I don't know what number that is.  Wasn't me.  Wasn't me.  Wasn't me. 
[00:13:00]  That's funny.  One time I put the jet ski in the water.  It was about two in the afternoon.  I got done with the job, you know.  I wouldn't just, I would finish the job.  But then I'd put the jet ski in the water and my beeper goes off.  It's Bob, my old boss, and I have to call in.  He's like, what are you doing?  Oh, get really caught up at this one job.  It's just a tough thing.  I can't quite get to that next job.  Okay.  They were great, though. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, can I go off on a wild tangent?  Yes.  I didn't know Asian guys could be gay.  Where the hell did that come from?  Oh, you know where it came from.  Yeah, I know where it came from.  I was very surprised to see that Asian people could be gay.  I thought they already were Asian.  Asian, I don't think, is a sexuality.  No, but I didn't know you could be Asian and gay at the same time.  I didn't know you could be black and gay at the same time. 
[00:14:00]  You could be black and gay.  You've been upstairs.  Yump and yimini.  No, the gay sushi.  Well, yeah, but be careful.  Oh, he's listening?  We're not even in the gay demo or the Asian demo.  That's true.  I wouldn't worry about him.  We were just wondering, because I know at sushi restaurants,  if the chicks F up, they go to the Yankee Cranky or Nail Shop.  Right.  Where do the gay Asian guys go if they screw up the sushi?  That's a very good question. 
[00:14:30]  Yeesh.  I learned something new today, though.  First time I've seen an Asian gay guy.  You probably have seen plenty.  You just didn't know.  Opie.  Got to be more open-minded.  I hope he's laughing as the guy.  Who are you laughing at?  He was so gay, I couldn't help myself.  I know.  He was so flamboyant.  He wasn't half as gay as the guy when we went out to dinner with Bruce Mittman the other night.  Oh.  That waiter, I swear to God, someone comes up behind me. 
[00:15:00]  No joke.  Comes up and goes, it's a woman's voice saying, can I take your order?  Would you like a drink?  I plan on turning around and seeing a girl.  It was a guy.  Very effeminate guy.  But he sounded like a woman.  The voice, everything.  It's like, ooh.  How's that for a topper?  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Let's go to Stephanie.  Stephanie, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to know if you're going to go out the right way and have some girls up there today,  or what are you going to do? 
[00:15:30]  Well, what do you got?  What do I got?  Yeah, you want to come over?  I'd love to come over.  I don't know what.  Yeah, sure.  Want to come over, rent a movie, fool around a little bit?  Let's do that.  Come on up.  You've got to tell me where you are.  I'm hoping someone brings a keg by today.  Listen.  Here's your kegger.  I'm hoping someone brings it by, too.  All right.  We'll be on hold.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  There's Stephanie.  We need some chicks for our kegger.  We're not having a kegger unless we get some chicks. 
[00:16:00]  And a keg.  And a keg.  We can't have a kegger without a keg.  I have a feeling, though, we can get a keg.  That's easy.  That's the easiest part.  Greg, what's going on?  How are you doing?  You need Nicky.  We deliver keggers.  Oh, I remember her.  Yeah, you promised in January that you would tell us what's going on with what was going  on with Rick.  Well, he's a lousy producer, and he almost got fired.  Rick almost got fired. 
[00:16:30]  There's got to be more than that.  Rick was taking the fall for our stupidity.  Yeah.  From Mark?  Mark.  I mean, was that the...  What was the...  There was some Howard-related problems over the last vacation that we took, and somebody's  head had to fall, and it couldn't be O&A's heads, because we're a little... 
[00:17:00]  I guess we're valuable to this company at some point, and so they were going to fire Rick  for that.  That's all.  Here you go.  Sort it out.  But teach us a lesson.  Right.  But they didn't...  They were surprised when we walked off the job.  Yeah, that was the day we said, no, and we're leaving if Rick gets fired.  So you owe us.  One day, and this day may never come, we may ask you for a thing.  Hey, buddy.  I believe that day came... 
[00:17:30]  Oh, shut up.  Big Bud Mendy, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just had to call in and wish you well with whatever you do.  Thank you.  We're not really going anywhere, though.  No, we're not leaving.  No, but...  I mean, you'll hear us in New York.  Well, and, I mean, Opie, you still have to smell my panties.  You were supposed to send them in.  I have been so busy.  I've been taking trips.  I went down to Georgia.  I'm going to Florida this weekend.  I'm going to Connecticut. 
[00:18:00]  It smells like hot garbage.  It smells like hot garbage and French as mustard.  Yeah, Mendy...  But, you know what?  Oh, God.  What?  Oh, I forgot.  Could you get it?  Yeah, Mendy needs to talk.  Hey, Mendy.  Start babbling about nothing for the next five minutes.  Boy, am I going to miss this.  Oh, you know, I just wanted to tell you guys that, you know, I'm driving around here with  my loud sign, and I've got my boobies out, and I'm hoping that, you know, somebody sees 
[00:18:30]  me.  Oh, they'll see you.  Well, how could they miss me, right?  Oh.  It's like throwing things at the phone trying to hit the off button.  There it goes.  It was like the Gone Show.  Everyone was, like, faking if they were going to be the one to hit the Gone.  Oh, is that it?  And finally we did it.  Oh.  Oh, but I wish Mendy would listen.  I just wish she was a listener instead of a talker.  She doesn't listen. 
[00:19:00]  The deal with Mendy, really fast, she sells her used panties.  Yeah.  And I was going to take a whip.  You wouldn't do that.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  I told you I would.  All right, we should take a break, Anthony.  All right, let's get to fun, fun, fun.  Yeah, we have lots to do today.  We've got to start with the Bush girls.  Got to love those Bush gals.  We'll get into that next, okay?  Party in little hose bags.  Hot.  Hot.  Yeah.  Hotters. 
[00:19:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never gets old.  Home of the Hummer.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  On 1027 WNEW.  Anthony, my old boss is on the line.  Oh, yeah?  Swear to God. 
[00:20:00]  Get out.  I've only had two jobs in my life.  Radio DJ.  Yeah.  And caddy.  That's some resume.  God, man.  College grad.  Two jobs that meant anything after my paper route.  Nice.  Caddying.  And on-air personality.  And we don't know what's going to happen after today, so I might have to go back to the  Huntington Crested Club and do some lupin'.  Lupin.  John.  Opie.  Yeah, that's you, all right. 
[00:20:30]  On down.  What's going on, man?  I don't know how good a caddy you are, but we'll take you back.  You remember.  I was one of the best, John.  Oh, Opie.  He doesn't remember, Opie, that you were a great caddy?  He was good.  He wasn't great.  I tell the stories all the time.  I was one of the best.  A lot of the Islanders would play golf there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we still got a lot of them here.  Yeah.  I was right behind Wano and Ralphie.  I was right there.  Top three caddies of all time at the Huntington Crested Club. 
[00:21:00]  Yes, you were, and we'll never forget it.  Showby's the golf pro at the Huntington Crested Club.  How many years have you been there now, John?  About 25.  Wow.  I started as a punk.  I was 12 or 13 years old.  Hey, you good?  He's real good.  Yeah, I bet.  Damn, I can't get back in.  Everyone wanted a caddy for John's show because he kept it straight.  Yeah.  And, yeah, he was just amazing.  Maybe he could teach me. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, sure.  Come on out.  So what's going on, John?  We need Opie to come back to straighten some of these caddies out.  Oh, yeah?  It hasn't been the same Opie since you left.  Yeah, a bunch of slackers, right?  Oh, well, you know.  The good caddy is important.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, John, what do you think of Casey Martin and the car thing?  I'm happy for Casey.  Oh, God.  Ah, look at that, Opie.  Yeah, I think Casey deserves to tee up his ball with the best. 
[00:22:00]  John, you've always been politically correct.  I tried to teach you when I was there.  That's right.  You did a good job.  I tried to get you to come on the dark side.  Oh, no.  The dark side.  Don't you think that the PGA, though, can govern their own sport?  Well, it's...  You don't mean the court system telling the PGA, you know, what they should and shouldn't do.  Right, John?  Yeah, but Casey's got one shot at it, and he deserves that shot.  Ah, I don't know.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know.  I'm not buying it.  I think walking's part of the game.  Well...  Even though I use a card all the time.  Yeah, that's Anthony.  I don't even drive the card back to where it belongs.  I drive it all the way to my car in the parking lot, and I leave it.  And just leave it there?  I've got to go.  Yeah, we've got a lot of people like you.  I've got to go.  Hey, John, Anthony, not a good golfer.  I suck.  I totally admit it.  But I love the game, and I just wish I'd get better.  Oh, well, you've got to come out here to the Huntington Crescent Club.  All right.  You know, I'm going to do that.  I want to take a lesson.  It's Opie's old backyard. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I used to sneak on that course all the time.  Well, I remember sneaking on there in the winter to go tobogganing.  Right.  That was always a big thing.  That would be, Anthony, if I remember correctly, the 11th hole.  Yes.  11th and 12th hole.  Yeah, yeah.  Very nice.  Very good.  Yeah.  Good sledding.  Hey, what are they getting for a bag these days, John?  Oh, you wouldn't believe it.  When I was there, it was $8 a bag, and if you did a good job, you get the $10.  Oh, boy.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for it.  Right. 
[00:23:30]  No, it's gone up.  It's more than tripled now, Opie.  What is the average?  Well, the most get between $35 and $50 a bag.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Man.  Nice.  And some of the rookie caddies get less, but it's totally different.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to come by and say hi to you.  Yeah, I hope you can.  Sign your picture that's in the caddy shack.  It's been a long time.  It has been a long time.  How's the family doing well? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, everyone's great.  Good.  My mom loves you because you got us out of the house and made us work and stuff.  Whenever John needed caddies, like on those bad, rainy, maybe cold days.  Oh, I'd call up the Opie family.  Call up my mom, and my mom would be screaming just like in caddy shack.  That's right.  Getting everyone out of bed and out the door to make money for the family.  You wouldn't be cementing your backyard on days like that?  Well, we did the cementing on our days off, Anthony.  Okay.  Yes.  Well, John, it was great talking to you.  I'm going to stop by and say hi to you guys.  Okay, Opie. 
[00:24:30]  I hope so.  Say hi to the gang, all right?  You got it.  Okay.  All right, man.  See you.  There he goes, my old boss, John.  Did he ever call you up and go, how'd you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  The nicest guy right there.  I want these shoes stripped, buffed, with a fine chamois.  Chop, chop.  And I want it now.  Don't you people have homes?  There you go.  You have an in.  I have an in.  I still don't know if I'm in at Apollo.  Should we call your old boss now?  Well, if they call, I'll talk to them. 
[00:25:00]  I really need my job, my old tin knocking job back.  Yeah.  With my old truck.  Remember, I don't go in without a truck.  I got to negotiate.  Need the trailer hits.  Let's go to Dean.  Dean, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  I figured I'd probably take a good part of the rest of the day, so why don't you start  a round of now?  What have I learned in the past three years on the O&A show?  Oh, wow.  That could be fun.  Oh, that would be absolutely great.  Maybe we'll do some of that on the instant feedback today, all right?  Oh, that would be a great idea. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  I wouldn't know where to start.  No doubt.  Yeah, right?  Cool.  Bye, guys.  Thanks, Dean.  All right.  Take it easy.  Ray from Whitestone reminded me, Anthony, don't forget, WNEW can make you work.  That means Opie's house is going to look like the E. Leon Gonzalez fiasco.  Opie kicking and screaming as Black Earl abducts him and runs to the W.A.W. van being driven  by Jeremy Colman with a ski mask on.  Very good.  You've got a famous picture of you coming out of the, when the guys open up the closet and 
[00:26:00]  you're being held captive.  Sure.  All right.  We were going to talk about the Bush Daughters, right?  Yes, the lovely bushes.  Those two hot bushes.  Mm-mm.  He's got Bush.  Wow.  He's got Bush.  Well, they're always in hot water, these girls, and I love it.  They're acting like teen girls, like normal teen girls, college girls. 
[00:26:30]  Of course, the other day, Jenna gets busted trying to buy some liquor with a fake ID.  And now they're saying, which one of the daughters is in the frat house video?  Is that Jenna also?  Oh, yeah.  No, Jenna's the bad girl.  Yeah.  Jenna's trying to talk her little sister into all the debauchery, but the sister's not really  going for it yet.  A little bit, but.  College mates of Jenna Bush are claiming to have made a homemade video of the president's 
[00:27:00]  daughter in a drunken state.  And the student's now threatening to publicly release the tape.  Who doesn't want to get their hands on this?  You think she's flashing anything?  Would that rock?  Hey, and here's Jenna Bush's Bush, or Baby at the Beach, or Dog with a Ball. 
[00:27:30]  You vote.  Here's Jenna Bush in a three-way gangbang, or Grandma Geek come out at weddings.  They all fall in the crotch.  Cat gets bird.  Or Jenna Bush, five-way anal.  Time to cast your votes.  So, who cares? 
[00:28:00]  So, she's drunk, and she was at a frat house, and they got a video of it.  She's a normal teenage gal.  She's completely normal.  Unfortunately, she's the president's daughter.  Yeah.  I heard something today that just puts a lot of perspective on this, Opie.  Go ahead.  You know the government's war on everything?  War on drugs?  Drugs, the booze, the cigarette smoke, everything.  There's all these federal wars on things, how we're going to clean up everything.  And they always come up with this big proposal of how we're going to stop drug use and alcohol  use and cigarette use with the youth and stuff like that. 
[00:28:30]  This just puts perspective on it.  I heard this today.  Here's a girl, two girls, the sisters, brought up white, suburban, upper-class girls from a home with two parents.  These girls are tailed by federal agents 24 hours a day, and they're still using fake IDs, buying booze.  What hope does the rest of the country have?  Well, I mean, federal agents following them 24 hours. 
[00:29:00]  And they can get their booze and their fake IDs.  And they can get their stuff.  You're going to put feds on everyone in the country, and it still obviously doesn't work.  It would never, ever work.  Let everyone do their drugs, booze, butts, anything.  It's insane.  Good point.  Very good point.  Very good point.  I'm just perfect, Sam.  I'm just psyched we finally got some hot president daughters.  Yeah, we've been on a dry spell for a while.  I mean, Amy Carter, Chelsea when she first got in there. 
[00:29:30]  Chelsea was bad.  Reagan had that disgusting daughter.  Who else?  The, well, Bush's granddaughters, but that was these girls.  Yeah, we haven't had any hotties in the office.  Well, Bush's granddaughters, they were only the...  How about Trisha?  Trisha Nixon.  Remember her?  Was she a hottie?  No, she was a slut.  She looked like Tricky Dick.  Yeah.  With a wig, right?  Jay Moore, what's going on?  Don't forget Barbara Bush.  She was a hottie. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, George's mother.  George Washington's, maybe.  Kelly Ripa mentioned you guys on the show, guys.  She brought it up.  I don't know if she did.  What?  I don't know if we got an official mention.  I think she mentioned she was on a radio show.  Don't forget we taped two shows today, my friend.  Oh, you did?  One of those you did not witness.  Not only did she mention you guys and say she had fun, but I caught her looking at my crotch  and I had mentioned it three times. 
[00:30:30]  Oh.  Stop it.  Yeah, because I had a really cool suit on that was tight.  Right.  And I said, I just found out backstage the suit doesn't go well with boxer shorts.  She says, so you're, and she's trying to look for the, I go, yeah, that's what I'm doing.  And then I go, what are you, what are you looking to check if I'm telling the truth?  She goes, no, I just, I'm like, you just did it again.  Wow.  Wow.  And then I met her husband afterwards.  Oh, how did that go?  He was a good guy, but you could tell he wasn't crazy about how much chemistry his wife and 
[00:31:00]  I had.  Well, you guys are flirting way too much now.  It's getting out of control, Jay.  Let's start off all night.  I can't help if she has sex with me all the time.  Oh, my God.  See, that's that platonic relationship that, um.  That you were explaining yesterday?  That just, you're setting it up.  You're setting it up.  I said, Jay Moore sets these girls up and constantly has 20 girls in the glass cabinets  that, in case of emergency, break less.  He works it right to the point of closing the deal and then puts it in suspended animation 
[00:31:30]  so that at any given moment, if the opportunity comes up, uh, God forbid anything happens with  you and your wife, you could just go close the deal.  You'll have 20 prospects, all hot, in seconds.  You're on to me.  Let me ask you something, let me ask you this, Anthony.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen anybody do anything close to the, any, let me try this again.  I woke up from a nap.  I'm a little retarded.  That's all right.  Have you ever seen anything like it from any man?  No, you work it, man.  Oh, that's right.  And I'm kind to him. 
[00:32:00]  I'm good to these hoes.  You're constantly working it.  Hey, Jay, so I watched this morning.  First of all, you killed.  Oh, thank you.  A lot of people saying that, by the way, in the email and on the instant feedback today.  But I have an observation.  Please tell me.  It was, I was laughing so hard at home.  It has nothing to do with you.  You were really kind to Colleen Haskell.  The girl from Survivor.  She was beautiful.  Oh, she's beautiful.  She's in the new movie with Rob Schneider as Rob Schneider's girlfriend.  This girl cannot act whatsoever. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, you saw the clip?  Jay?  I thought she did okay in the clip.  Oh, you're being PC?  Is this a joke?  No, no, I'm not being PC.  You have to keep in mind Rob Schneider and a freaking orangutan are slapping each other  in the scene.  So I'm not really paying attention to what she's saying.  All right.  But no, let me explain the clip they showed.  Usually, Jay knows.  You know, you go on these talk shows.  I didn't even think of that.  Okay, good.  You're hilarious.  Okay, I got it, right?  Yeah, you're the best.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  So when you go on these talk shows and you're in this new movie and you're selling yourself 
[00:33:00]  in the movie and you're showing the clip, it's usually you doing something pretty cool  in the movie, right?  Your clip.  The clip of Colleen Haskell.  Yeah.  Her back is turned to the camera for the entire clip.  The whole clip.  As she's holding a parrot talking to the parrot and you don't even see her lips move.  Oh, my God.  All you see is the back of her head.  And this is her showing off what she was doing in the movie.  Jay's being nice, though.  Jay, critique it as the Jerry Maguire Jay Moore, not the Mafia Jay Moore. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Well, I think given the circumstances of that film.  Okay.  And who she's working with.  In the context of the film.  Yes.  And considering I was watching her back speak.  Yeah.  That was the weirdest thing because, yeah, that's what you saw in the background.  I didn't even realize it.  And then when you guys came back from the clip, it was kind of like she kind of noticed, like,  oh, oh, wow, that didn't really show anything.  She kept saying during the clip, they were really doing that to each other.  And I was like, they couldn't be because an orangutan would take your dome off. 
[00:34:00]  What about this?  John from Brooklyn saying, how about Colleen pulling away from Jay when they kissed goodbye?  Yeah, she wasn't.  What happened there, Jay?  I didn't notice.  You didn't feel it?  Well, the pin pan wasn't working with the Colleen Haskell.  No, her mother looked like Laura Bush.  She was standing right there.  Oh, really?  Oh.  We did a cutaway.  I didn't see that.  The last chick I want to get mixed up with is somebody that got voted off an island and  parlayed it into a Blistex commercial in a Rob Schneider movie. 
[00:34:30]  You did a chick that's in Swank Magazine with, you know, doing the Motley Crue trick with  the $100 bill.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  How on crack was that Mrs. Green Thumbs?  Well, you didn't know what to say to her.  Yeah.  Well, I also knew, like, why would I say anything?  We're gardening.  Regis knows how to handle Mrs. Green Thumbs.  Mrs. Green Thumbs, what are you doing?  You just got to act like everything she's doing is outrageous.  No, I got an observation on that, too. 
[00:35:00]  You guys spend so much time in the beginning of the show just killing with the chemistry  and stuff.  I know.  You had to make it up on the back end of the show, so Mrs. Green Thumbs, I think she  was on for maybe two minutes.  Right.  And that happened last time.  Annabelle Sciarra came out for a 14-second interview.  It was two segments, total time, two minutes with her.  You know, Green Thumbs used to be in the Grownlings.  Well, she did a little cha-cha dance when she came out.  I thought maybe she was just on crack.  I think she was a hot number way back in the day. 
[00:35:30]  Like, she's got those huge cans.  Look at that.  They just laughed at that.  That's all I was thinking about.  I was like, man, you know, this just brought that out of her mind.  But back in the day, look at these rockets.  She's got some green elevators.  She must have brown nipples from Gardening Nude.  Rubbing in the peat moss.  This is brown nips. 
[00:36:00]  I'm so glad I called your last show.  Yes.  Day zero.  Day zero.  Day zero of our content.  Infinity, have fun.  It was nice while you had it, jackassers.  We are Infinity Broadcasting.  We kowtow to a 500-pound Jewish gorilla.  Now we lost stars.  Harry Carrey and Bob Murphy was a big hit yesterday.  Oh, my God.  It's all anyone's talking about.  It was great.  We might have to replay that today.  I'm going to dig up the tape of all the stuff. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Perish the thought we actually do a whole show on our last day here.  No, we might run that at 6.30 and get the hell out of here.  How long is that been, Rick?  Go drink.  That thing's like 25 minutes long.  All right.  I'll start at 6.30 tonight.  If you missed Harry Carrey and Bob Murphy.  What's Rick Hidalgo doing?  When's the softball game, Rick?  When do you want to get together?  Because it's just going to be us.  Yeah.  Nothing is planned.  Hey, so what kind of mention did Kelly give us?  We did two shows today.  One was for tomorrow.  Right. 
[00:37:00]  And Chef Kel was there.  And you know what Kelly said to me?  Chef Kel is still, like, doing things?  He's great.  I ate, like, a whole bunch of chicken because I was so hungry.  Chicken.  Chicken.  You want some chicken?  Chicken.  So, wow.  Chicken.  I can't.  I do that, like, every time I'm eating chicken.  Respect.  But we don't know your bit because we don't really see you, like that girl said yesterday.  You know, I've been to every John Ward gig since we met you.  She goes, does he still do the soap bit?  And we were ready to explain the soap bit.  She goes, stop faking it. 
[00:37:30]  I know you guys don't really go to him.  Oh, no.  We know his stuff.  I'm like, what is that?  Chicken.  Chicken.  Chicken.  When I did that last time at Caroline's, I really blew the dust off that bit.  Like, I haven't done it in, like, six years.  Yeah.  So, for you to just say, chicken, all of a sudden, I was like, hey, wait, that's funny.  That's mine.  Hey, now you know how we feel.  Goes around, goes around.  I tell you what, I tell you what, I tell you what, I tell you what, I tell you what, I tell 
[00:38:00]  you what.  Yeah, that's right.  Rat baby.  I just busted it out.  Nice.  So, what's the mention tomorrow?  She brought you guys up, and she said, Opie and Anthony, and then I said, Opie and Anthony,  and she goes, yeah, they made fun of me, because I said, Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  But she said it, and she said she had fun.  And, oh, and we're talking about Chef Pell, me and her?  Yeah.  And this is, like, during commercials, like, N10, night.  She goes, try to get him to say tart, he can't say it, he always says, twat. 
[00:38:30]  I go, what?  She goes, he's like, here's a lovely summer twat.  And I'm like, well, when are you going to say it?  She's like, he's making chicken.  I'm like, so what?  Make a chicken twat.  I'd like a twat with chicken.  Hey, hey, this guy says, uh, ask Jay about the big wet one he planted on Kelly as soon  as the lights went down just before travel trivia. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  You did?  Yes, I did.  Nice.  I told her we should tongue kiss.  You work it, man.  You work it.  No, it's like travel trivia, the first show, and, like, that wheel comes down, and, uh,  you spin it.  Right.  Travel trivia.  And just when the lights went out, I was just so happy that the segment went well.  I leaned over and started making an album.  You're insane.  I'm not insane.  That's how it goes.  When you're working for the man upstairs, you get these impulses and you act on them.  Hold on. 
[00:39:30]  Joe saw that.  Joe.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I'm with Jay Moore.  He's making the move completely.  The lights go down.  It's like he's in a movie somewhere.  The lights go down, and all of a sudden, I look over, and there he is, leaning in for  the move.  It was the funniest thing in the world.  I was cracking up.  I didn't think you guys...  I don't know if anybody saw it.  I was losing it.  You're priceless, man.  I thought it was a move successful.  Yeah, it looked like it.  It sure was.  She didn't slap you in the head.  No, she...  When I rubbed her back, she went lower.  Did she go for the, uh, what are we going to do about this move? 
[00:40:00]  No, you can't do that to somebody, nine months pregnant.  No.  All right.  I thought it was the funniest thing.  Cold.  Thanks, Joe.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  All right.  All right.  There goes Joe.  Let me get Jay back on.  Jay.  Yo.  Did you go for some stinky pinky?  I tried, man.  Yeah.  I've been on it all day.  It's hard.  Yeah.  Just give her a little reach.  Get the pinky.  I tried.  One time I was talking to Chef Tal, and she, like, bumped her belly into me.  Whoa.  Hey, look at that.  Is that, like, pregnant protocol, like, you know, like, when a woman blows smoke in your 
[00:40:30]  face, is she supposed to like you?  Right.  What do you mean that she just takes her belly and, like, rams you?  She's in labor.  Yeah.  What did Rick say?  She's in labor.  She's the best, man.  Hey, Kelly, what's going on?  I just have to tell you, making my drive home, you're the funniest thing I've ever heard  in my life.  Oh, thanks.  Isn't that great?  I've got to tell you that.  You guys aren't bad either, aren't I?  Oh, I thought you were talking about it.  What's in your pants, Kelly?  No, I'm just kidding.  Thank you.  All right, Kelly.  Bye, Kelly.  Kelly doesn't want to play. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  You kissed, um, Jay.  When they don't want to play, it usually means it's not well kept.  Jay.  Yeah.  You kissed Kelly's palm?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You do that move.  You did that last time.  Right.  Well, I wanted to remember, like, yeah, I'm the guy who kissed your palm.  Let's not forget it, right?  Yeah.  Remember this nice move, honey?  I got all the tricks.  I'll kiss the back of her knees.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You're on with Jay Moore.  Yeah, man, he was out of control this morning.  I was actually, I was embarrassed to watch it.  You get that embarrassed feeling when someone does something crazy on TV and you're like, 
[00:41:30]  oh, my God.  No, Jay killed, because I was a little scared for Jay Moore, I'm not going to lie, because  you killed the last time you were on, and I'm like, man, I don't know if he's going  to be as good the second time.  Hard to follow.  And you know what, Jay?  You were definitely as good, if not better.  What was he on, like, besides no sleep?  I don't do anything, man.  People think I'm always on something.  Dude, that was crazy.  I was looking at your eyes, and you were, like, spacing out, like, you looked like a  kid in English class, like you were going to pass out or something.  Dude, it's six in the morning.  Let's see how funny you are.  Six?  I thought it was a nine o'clock show. 
[00:42:00]  Don't look.  Come on.  You had to get there to get sandblasted into your suit.  Real quick for Anthony.  Anthony, you still playing Counter-Strike?  Yeah, I play everything on that.  Does that hostage sound like Brian Regan or what when he says, come on, let's go?  Come on, let's go.  Yeah, he sounds just like Brian Regan.  Yeah, very funny.  All right, guys, good luck.  I'll be listening to New York.  And, Jeff, you missed the whole point.  Jay was imitating Andrew McCarthy.  Oh, I'm sorry, bro.  I'm not a big chill fan or whatever he's in, the brat fan.  The big chill?  Whatever he was in.  The breakfast club. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, the back of that chick.  All right, later, guys.  All right, man.  Let me tell you something about Colleen Haskell.  It was St. Elmo's Fire, by the way.  Okay.  Yes, Jeff?  The second you see her, you want to marry her.  She's beautiful.  There's just something about her.  I just felt bad that the only clip they could show of her was the back of her head.  Yeah.  I don't know, but that orangutan was funny.  Have him on the show.  In real life, if you got smacked in the head by an orangutan, your friends are on the floor looking for your head.  Right.  Who else, since you did Tamar's show today, who was the guest to Tamar? 
[00:43:00]  We had to bring Mrs. Brown Nips back.  You're kidding.  Well, because the segment was so short.  And then they tied me to a pole.  What?  Yeah, you know, you're...  You're being lady like Regis.  You got to tie the tomato plants up?  Right.  She tied my hand up.  Hey, Jay.  I'm up.  Jay, you were funny with Wycliffe.  That's my man.  The guy was in the chicken suit while his rap guys were doing their thing.  I didn't know it was Wycliffe in the chicken suit. 
[00:43:30]  Chicken suit.  It was a San Diego chicken.  And he was holding the mic up to the chicken head.  To his eye.  To his eye, because that's, I guess, where his neck was.  And then he takes the head off.  I'm like, oh, my God, there's Wycliffe.  I was expecting him to come out to join the rappers.  Right.  And then he takes off the head of the chicken suit, and he can't breathe.  And Jay just works it.  I was laughing.  I didn't think he had the balls to comment on the fact that he was breathing really heavy,  like he just ran a marathon. 
[00:44:00]  He's a Jersey guy, man.  Yeah.  You know, Barry Katz, the big Jew, says, this is something I don't understand.  This is after he just did two shows.  We're really excited about it, you know.  This is all Barry can say on the drive home.  You could pay people $500 to get into a chicken suit.  They won't do it.  This guy does it for no reason.  I really don't understand it.  I was thinking of the financial angle.  Yeah.  He's like, you know, he just said I'll give you $100, put on this chicken suit, and jump around. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, I don't understand why Wycliffe went into the chicken suit.  The name of the song was Cluck Cluck.  I understand that.  And then the next episode, we were cooking chicken with Chef Tal.  I don't know.  He's weird.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me go to John, who has a comment.  Hey, John, you're on with Jay Moore.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hi, John.  Hey, Jay, did you notice when Mrs. Greenbone came out, she grabbed her biceps?  She looked like she was about to have an orgasm?  She is.  She kept touching me.  Yeah.  I tell you, she used to be a wild bitch. 
[00:45:00]  A wild whore.  You guys are making me laugh.  It's too bad it's your last show.  Hey.  Hey, Jay, you should have pulled some Harry Caray on her, man.  Hey!  Why don't we plant some marijuana?  That's how you go to Como.  That's why I wear these glasses.  You know?  You know?  Do it other than you see?  All right.  Hold on, John.  I'm going to get rid of John. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, we were hoping for the Harry Caray this morning, Jay.  I need some Bob Murphy.  Is Bob going to make an appearance?  Well, yeah, I think you've got to be in here live for that.  I like the chemistry.  Right.  We're like Jay and Kelly.  She's the best, and she's a friend of the show.  Yeah.  There you go.  She's coming in here, and she's going to do some drinking, right?  She said, she's, oh, this is the other thing she said to me.  Before the first show, I said, we were just talking about it, like how good it was. 
[00:46:00]  And when she was laughing at the guy, it was funny.  And she goes, I've got to go in there when I'm not pregnant and show them, you know, that I can hang out, you know?  Hell, yeah.  I said, you go in when you're pregnant.  They don't care.  Rick's holding up a sign.  What show?  We'll still have a show, Rick.  Yeah.  Everything is completely up in the air right now.  And Kelly Ripa will be on our show.  She loves you guys.  All right.  Don't freak out.  Thanks, guys, for all the support.  I really appreciate it.  No problem, man.  We'll see Ed Raskolson in West Orange. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, and I did definitely kiss her when the lights went out.  Yeah, that's what people are saying.  You know what the fun thing is?  Hey, by the way, bravo on the satin sheet bit that you went.  See that?  Yeah.  You've got to go to the bounty cage.  Make sure you're not dipping the shoulder.  I felt kind of proud that he worked out that little bit on our little radio show.  Yes.  That show.  Man, you know what?  Got it ready for the national audience.  People are going to say that show was good.  I remember when Jane Moore, Jim Broward died.  Everybody used to go on that show.  Wow. 
[00:47:00]  The F word.  That's the first dump of the day, I think.  Nice.  Nice one, Jay.  Who am I?  Ready?  I'm going to do an impression.  You guess who I am.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Blah, blah, blah.  You can take your top off.  Oh.  Take off your top.  Do you remember threesome?  This is exactly what I said to the last 16 girls.  Let me tell you something.  You're so hot, honey.  I would have banged you so hard.  Let me tell you something, Robin.  Let me tell you something, Robin.  I have a tattoo on my arm. 
[00:47:30]  No one has any idea what the hell it means.  I think it's a cab driver's first name.  It's like a music note.  Let me tell you something, Robin.  I like to see Robin with those big black cans.  That's what I like to see.  What's boo?  You count chocular?  What are you doing, Howard?  You count chocular.  Boo.  Innovative.  Innovative.  And take off your top.  Come over here.  Let me spank you.  And then I'll take off your top. 
[00:48:00]  You know, usually I'm really good at figuring out your impressions.  I just can't figure this one out.  I can't put my finger on that one.  You know what's big green, man.  Hi.  Hey.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  My old friend Red Barber used to ask me to take my cap off.  Red Barber.  Right.  Red Barber, yeah.  You guys are the best.  All right, Jay.  You know what?  You know, I'm doing a movie down in Arkansas.  We're going to need runners and stuff. 
[00:48:30]  So if you guys need money, come down.  Cool.  I'll put you to work.  All right.  I'll put you to work.  All right.  I'm going to go walk my dog now.  One of the few treats of having my dog with me.  Oh, cool.  Have fun.  Love you guys.  All right.  Take care, Jay.  Watch tomorrow because she mentions you guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Why doesn't Regis ever have Jay on as like a guest?  Never understood that.  I think Jay would be pretty good with the Regis. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  He's probably going to.  No, it must have been on that show.  As a guest.  They had Colleen Haskell on for Christ's sake.  Yeah, well.  God, we should have got her on the show after all.  We blew her off and Rob Schneider.  We blew her off?  And I told you how much I liked her.  Why did we blow her off?  I don't know.  I have to take the blame for this.  Oh, like Rob Schneider.  Screw him.  I could give a crap, but she would have been cool to have on.  Maybe we could still get her.  No?  Did we blow that bridge over the river? 
[00:49:30]  Why?  We blew it up like that.  We can't call up the public and say we changed our mind?  Damn.  No?  Too late.  All right.  212-757-1027.  If you want in on the show today, I think a mommy's coming by to play.  Mommy, what would you do for NSYNC tickets?  Bless you.  What time is she coming in?  Sometime after 4.30.  And which girl is this?  The Tarn Feather girl.  Tarn Feather.  Don't call her a girl.  Tarn Feather mom.  Mom.  She's going to be naked and we're going to Tarn Feather her for NSYNC tickets. 
[00:50:00]  NSYNC tickets.  For her kids.  Nice.  That's good.  All the other mommies blew us off.  Yeah.  And Rich Voss is wandering around here.  Oh, is he?  Yeah, we'll get him in here as well, okay?  All right.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Are you crazy?  Hold on.  You mother-efforts.  Eat the crap.  Somebody stop it.  Stop it. 
[00:50:30]  Damn you.  Shut up.  Boys.  Yeah, fuck it.  Come here.  Oh, oh, girl.  Okay.  I'm a boy.  Yeah, suck, suck, suck.  Fuck it.  Somebody stop it.  Yo, twelve.  Hide her.  Easy.

[00:53:00]  We were talking about the Bush Daughters, and then Jay called in.  Uh, Catherine.  Holy cow, I'm on the air.  Yes, you are, Catherine.  Listen, um, I just wanted to know, I really love you guys, and if you guys are going to  be, like, at a different radio station, how am I going to find out where you guys are?  You know what?  That's a really good question.  I don't think, um, anyone will know how to find us.  Maybe we could, like, I don't know, put smoke signals in the air.  Oh, my God.  That would be great.  You know what?  Hold on.  Metallica rules, man. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah!  Oh, God.  Yeah!  Thank you, Catherine.  You're welcome.  I love you guys.  You could have said anything in the world, and that's what you chose to say.  Really?  Because I'm, like, this beautiful, blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl.  That large in the background yelling, yeah!  All right, Catherine.  We do.  Thank you.  I love you.  That's good.  Uh, to answer a question, Ophi, um, I think if things did happen where we weren't here  any longer, I think word might get out where we would be.  I'm hoping.  I don't think it would be a hard thing to really find. 
[00:54:00]  Um, I think it would be huge news.  Yeah, maybe the New York Post.  I don't know.  I'm hoping someone would say something.  I would think word would get out to where we would be.  I would assume our buddies Ron and Fez would tell everybody.  I don't know.  They might have a gag order put on.  Oh, okay.  I would run right to our new bosses and say, tell them.  We'll sue if Ron and Fez talk about us.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:54:30]  Come on.  Gag order.  That old gag.  That old order.  That old order.  Oh, brother.  I wouldn't worry about that.  Let me, uh, go to Mitchell.  Mitchell, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I want to tell you what I learned the last three years.  Well, first of all, I learned that you work for a company that doesn't believe in freedom of speech.  I learned that...  I think we solved that problem today if you've been listening closely.  I always told you guys in the end we always win. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, but, you know, certain parties in the morning, freedom of speech.  I've learned also that syndication underground is the best way to reliably get you guys out of the New York market, unfortunately.  Where are you calling from?  New York.  Oh, all right.  But, you know, upon occasion, I listened from the office, and I learned that you guys really, really, really need...  Oh, to hang up on this call. 
[00:55:30]  What, Mitchell?  I think you're...  Punch out, Maverick.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Stalker Patty.  What a surprise.  Ah!  What a surprise she has stopped by.  Patty?  Are we going to let her in?  Of course Patty's here.  Jesus.  What do you expect?  Is she out there?  Where is she?  Oh, she's upstairs.  Go get her.  I gotta come down. 
[00:56:00]  Say what you're doing.  Oh, I miss you guys.  What, did she have, like, a present or something for us?  That's what I heard.  Hey, should today be the day we actually frisk her?  This could be her last queen shot.  Yeah.  I wouldn't worry about it.  I think she's harmless.  Brendan from Hicksville.  What did I learn over the past three years?  Is that the big yellow one is the sun.  Never hire anyone nicknamed Spaz.  And that Anthony once tried to beat up a future NFL quarterback. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Actually, he beat me up.  Well, you tried to beat him up and you lost.  Defending myself poorly.  Where is she?  Patty.  A hundred bucks to the person that makes her cry today.  Oh, God.  Just punch her.  Game on.  All right.  Punch her and win.  Game on.  Oh.  Hi.  I expect to come down.  Patty.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Fine.  I didn't get to hear the first hour of the show today, so you must have said any kind 
[00:57:00]  of news or whatever that I missed, so I just wrote a letter asking this.  It's wild.  Going to Venus.  She didn't hear?  She looked just like that caricature that's on the poster.  Jesus H.  Christ.  She looked just like it.  You didn't hear?  We explained our plight for the first hour of the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I was working.  I just got out of work.  I'm Patty.  Look at our faces. 
[00:57:30]  I know.  We're out of here.  We got fired.  You did not.  That's a lie.  I know you can tell.  Not telling the truth.  Look into our eyes.  This is it.  You're not fired.  Good.  No, you just can't come to an agreement with what's going on, so you're not entirely happy,  so you're going to win.  She was a hoo-er.  That's all.  She was a hoo-er.  I heard that.  But anyway, I just simply wrote a nice little letter here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:58:00]  Patty, we're out of here.  You can give us a seven.  I just was going to just send it down.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  What does it say, Opie?  What does it say?  Is it perfumed?  No.  Smells like the friolator.  Hi.  Oh, wait.  You do the Patty voice, so here you go.  Let me see.  Oh, stop.  Hi, guys.  Guys, I wasn't able to hear the first 40 minutes of the show today and probably missed what's 
[00:58:30]  actually happening with you and management.  I'm assuming from the facts, I do know that you're still not entirely happy and there's  yet no resolution with your contract.  I understand things have not been fair in the last three years and management's not been  appreciative of what you've done for management. 
[00:59:00]  Well, I admit I don't express myself very well.  I want you to know I appreciate your talents and the high point of my day is you.  Yeah, you've got to do that part first.  And the high point in my day you've brought to me, I love you two very much and want you  to be around always. 
[00:59:30]  I feel angry at management because they don't always know a good thing when they have it.  I want to see everything work out for you in the best way possible.  Whatever is happening tomorrow, et cetera.  I'm a friend.  As a friend, I want you to know.  I value all of you on the ONA show as friends of the show. 
[01:00:00]  What?  As a friend of the show.  And want to know where you're going to continue on the air.  Any change in the station I tune into, if no longer any W, I'd hope to have my birthday on the show, by the way,  but I don't know what's going on by Monday, June 4th.  But as a friend, I'll be waiting for news and information on you and hope you'll still continue to be on the air. 
[01:00:30]  And soon, I support you enough to let you go to choose what's best for you.  Well, thank you.  What you need is more important.  Love.  Body.  Well, nice little manifesto.  Anything you want to say, Patty?  Because this is it.  Oh, I don't...  Well, I don't think it's going to be it.  You'll be around somewhere else, Maisie. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, yes, if I throw out these hands out the window, will they clap when they land?  I didn't write that.  You didn't?  No.  That was you.  Patty, I can tell you this.  This is the last time you'll see us in person.  That's it, Patty.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  You're real funny. 
[01:01:30]  I'm serious.  We were.  Three years.  Broadcasting from Honolulu.  Oh, Ange.  Ange giving him a...  We can tell you this much.  You'll probably still be able to hear us, but it won't be easy just to stop by and say hi.  Yeah.  I didn't hear it.  What did you say?  It's a finger in your mouth.  What did you say?  Yeah.  That you'll probably be able to still hear us, but it won't be easy just to stop on by. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What station are you moving to?  It's more moving from the New York area.  Clickradio.  Dot com.  Dot com.  We're going to a dot com station because they're doing so well.  All those dot com things.  It's a way for the future.  Yeah.  Very funny.  We're not laughing today.  No, it's not funny, Patty.  No.  Ask any of the callers.  We've discussed this for an hour.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  We're not going to be able to do the road shows and stuff anymore.  Why weren't you listening, Patty?  You weren't listening.  Ben?  Tell her.  Oh, I'm going to sorely miss running into you every morning in front of the Brooklyn  Diner, though.  That would make you very sad.  All right.  Ben's being polite.  Anything else you want to tell her?  It's just that, Patty, you don't have to give me advice in the morning.  You know, she offered advice over at McDonald's. 
[01:03:00]  If you want to talk.  No, it's okay.  I have a college education.  I have a real job.  I don't need your help.  You have a real job?  You never told me, right?  I've never done that.  You did, too?  She was out in front of the Brooklyn Diner this morning.  I'm like, oh, Christ, there she is.  First thing, I'm like, I haven't even had my coffee.  I'm like, there she is.  Advice.  Hello, Ben.  Good morning.  Any word on the contract, if you need any advice, you want to talk. 
[01:03:30]  I didn't say that.  You did, too.  One of the sales guys upstairs saw it.  And she did say, you did say the best of luck.  But I'm going to lie.  I said the best of luck is what happens.  Best of luck.  Dear Patty, Collum, you thinking of doing this?  Dear Patty, my boyfriend wants to start doing anal, but I don't know how to go about it.  Just a little bit up and let it ride.  So would I, too.  So, Patty, what do you want to say?  This is it.  You'll see we're for real tomorrow. 
[01:04:00]  I don't care if you don't believe us.  But you shouldn't, you know, let this opportunity pass you by.  We might be able to come to New York to do road shows from time to time.  We're hoping.  Stalker P. and Limo A. show.  Afternoons at N.E.W.  It was more like the Anthony still, actually.  W-O-N-A, maybe?  Isn't that where we're going?  Right.  But don't let this moment pass.  This is it.  Here you go, Patty.  What do you want to say?  Dump out your feelings. 
[01:04:30]  Well.  Yes.  First of all, I don't know what to say.  You're going to kick yourself when you realize that this is for real.  Yeah.  So go ahead.  Go ahead, Patty.  Going to miss a lot of faces.  Go ahead, Patty.  Hey, English.  What is that? 
[01:05:00]  I'm never going to England.  Come on, Patty.  I got to put a time limit on this, Patty.  What?  Because we got to move on.  Oops.  It's over.  Thanks, God.  This is it.  Well, whatever happens, best of luck.  I know I'll catch you again.  I know I'll see you again in the future.  I wouldn't be so sure.  In the future?  No, no, you won't.  I can guarantee it.  That's all you want to say? 
[01:05:30]  Well, I just read the post.  They're stalking us for three years?  Post article the first time.  I didn't mean to read the paper yesterday.  Post article.  Right.  Yeah.  But whatever.  Clear Channel offers you a better deal.  I say go for it.  Thank you, Patty, our agent.  Yeah.  Brilliant.  Patty Eatman.  Patty Eatman.  From Los Angeles.  From Los Angeles.  From Los Angeles.  Oh.  High-powered.  You didn't notice that? 
[01:06:00]  Los Angeles?  That's what we're trying to tell you.  Well, there are plenty of McDonald's out there for her to work at.  Oh, imagine that.  All those jobs are taken by the Mexicans.  I won't be there that much longer.  I work with Mexicans on Santa Monica Boulevard.  I won't be there that much longer.  What's with all the faggots in West Hollywood?  Patty.  Hi, this is Patty.  This is the Cleaver House. 
[01:06:30]  And what it is, it's a facade, which means false front.  Now we're passing the cycle out, which is only one-third scale,  so they made it look like it was bigger on the hill.  Okay, now we're in an earthquake.  An earthquake, huh?  Yeah, Greg.  It's started!  Ah, Mendy.  Mendy.  Hey, guys, how are you?  All right. 
[01:07:00]  I just had to call in and say my goodbyes to you guys,  and also to Patty.  Patty, this is the last time we're probably going to talk.  I know we've both been on.  You couldn't even help us out there.  All right, Patty, say your goodbyes, because we've got to move on.  Well, goodbye.  I wish...  Come on, say your goodbyes. 
[01:07:30]  Shut up!  Shut up!  Well...  Quiet.  I hope it's not a goodbye.  Quiet.  I hope I hear you again soon.  Quiet.  Thanks for helping out our radio show. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  All right.  So, take care.  Thank you.  And I'll see you again soon.  Oh, I can believe that if you like.  Sure.  Why not?  Here you go.  If it gives you hope.  Yeah, just remember, I'm a big supporter of yourself.  All right, Patty, thanks.  You're good.  Thank you.  Thanks for helping us out.  Bye-bye.  Okay.  All right, I'll see you later.  Okay, bye.  There she goes. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, my gosh, just cackling.  She had a tear in her eye.  Ah, no one wins the 100.  Who cares?  Okay.  All right, man.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  212-757-1027.  Yes, Rick?  Brewer and Gabe Marco calling in.  Where's Brewer?  He hasn't called yet, but he's calling this later on. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, cool.  Jim Brewer will be on the show in a few minutes here.  Gabe Marco from Disney, I guess.  Gay Disney.  Gay Disney is this week?  Gay Disney.  What?  All weekend.  All weekend.  I wonder if he's seeing the Gaysians down there.  Gabe Marco is calling from Gay Disney?  Yep.  It's Gay Week down at Disney?  Homos galore.  What are you doing here, Rick?  I don't know.  I'm going to ask you the same thing.  That's what I asked for.  Thank you.  We've got to ask you about the Gaysians.  The Gaysians, yes.  Learned something today, that Asians could be gay.  I never knew that before. 
[01:09:30]  I thought they were already just Asian.  Just Asian.  Right.  No overlapping things.  No.  It's not compatible.  Have you ever seen a gay cab driver?  Yes.  You have?  No.  Look at you.  All right.  And we have a mommy coming down to play.  Mommy, what would you do for NSYNC tickets?  She's getting tarn feathered for some ticks today, right?  All right.  Hey, this is John Mann.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on 102.7.  W-N-E-W. 
[01:10:00]  That's a W at the beginning and a W at the end and an E in the middle.  That's a direction on the compass.  Ah, Anthony Ritchie from Flushing.  Listening to Patty, harder than using foundrymusic.com.  Ah, Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yes, Opie.  I hope no matter where our journeys take us, we will always be friends with Joey and Paisano  of Mulberry Street in Little Italy, right? 
[01:10:30]  All the romance of Italy, warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  They serve incredible, authentic Italian cuisine, and it's made from old-world Italian recipes  and priced right, so you don't go broke.  The portions are huge, and they have incredible pasta lunch specials, too.  If you ever see Joey down there, the owner, say, hey, Joey.  And you know what he does?  He gives you a glass of wine in the house.  And they have a great wine list, too.  At Paisano of Mulberry Street, right in the heart of Little Italy, 136 Mulberry.  Call them up.  965.  I'm having such trouble with the numbers lately, Opie.  Why is that? 
[01:11:00]  965-1188, 965-1188.  They're open seven days a week.  Weekends till 2 a.m.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Wow, Opie and Anthony.  God damn genius.  1027 WNEW.  Never appears, this is here.  Come on.  212-757-1027 is our phone number. 
[01:11:30]  Let's go to Rich.  Rich, what's going on?  Nothing much.  What's chilling?  Looking at you guys?  Have a great time.  Right on, man.  What I've learned in the last three years is that you can take any good idea and make it great  by simply adding the word teen in front of it.  Teen.  Teen.  Teen.  Yes.  You will continue hearing teen little events.  Oh, and A.  What's going on?  Bobby, what's up?  Yeah.  What I learned in the last three years, anytime I hear the number two, I'm going to think,  that's a ponderish. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Hey, also, tomorrow, is it going to be like four hours of binge?  I don't know what they're going to do tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, you guys, have a go.  I'm going to go listen to myself for the last time.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Cool.  All right.  We don't know what NW is doing tomorrow.  No.  We know our contract ends today.  I plan.  We didn't reach any sort of agreement.  Then we'll take our chances and see what happens. 
[01:12:30]  I've already penciled in for tomorrow.  Very important.  Hours and hours of EverQuest online.  There you are.  That's my important day.  I know.  Level 14 shaman now, by the way.  It went up.  Yes, I got my new magic spells open.  Very excited.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Get it straight.  It's a geek.  No, that's not for you.  That's for our next guest.  Ah, who is a faggot.  Gay Marco.  Gay Marco.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Marco. 
[01:13:00]  How are you?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe what I'm hearing.  I can't believe it.  Where are you, Marco?  I am in Orlando, Florida.  When you shit upon us.  Ah.  And for those of you who read my column on foundrymusic.com last week, you know I'm here for Gay Disney.  Gay Disney.  Isn't that redundant?  Hey, Marco, I got to ask you something, though.  Yeah?  I learned something, that Asians could be gay. 
[01:13:30]  Duh.  Have you ever had a Gaysian?  Oh, God, yes.  Yeah?  Oh.  What is that, when you need something to relieve the stress and pressure of all the black guys?  They're so tiny.  Oh, hey, hey.  Gaysian.  Gaysians.  Oh, and they lay there in bed like dead fish.  Really?  Just like sushi.  Right.  Jinx, you got to buy me a beer. 
[01:14:00]  So you don't, all right.  I haven't heard that in years.  Buy me a beer.  Yeah, and use your butt as a bottle opener.  So what's the deal with the gay Asians?  Well, they're gay as everybody else.  Who the hell cares?  There's a million gay people here.  There are white gays, black gays, Asian gays, Indian gays, lesbians.  Oh, what's wrong with lesbians?  Oh, God, they're so manly.  Oh, they're not the hot lipstick lesbians.  I thought you would like them being manly because you like men. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Today, we were at the bug show.  They had this little bug movie at Animal Kingdom.  And this big, fat bull dyke sat in front of me with her mullet.  And she kept flipping it around.  And I was like ready to tell her, girlfriend, watch that mullet.  She was pissing me off.  And she kept jumping out of her seat because it was like in 3D and the little bug is flying around.  It was so cool.  Marco.  Yes?  What goes on at Disney during gay Disney? 
[01:15:00]  Well, it's like.  I can picture anal everywhere.  I wish.  Oh, my God.  Do you have time to ride the rides?  Of course.  I get motion sickness, so I have to be careful on what rides I ride on.  Yeah, get on Mr. Toad's Wild, huh?  What goes on at Disney?  What is it?  It's just gay guys all over the place. 
[01:15:30]  Yes.  All right, nothing.  It starts today.  Today's the first day.  The kickoff.  And today is the Animal Kingdom day.  Yeah.  Now, tomorrow's MGM.  Butthole Pirates of the Caribbean?  That's it.  Because the Caribbean is at Disney World or Disneyland, the big park.  Yes.  The main park.  Okay.  That's Saturday.  And Saturday is the big, huge event day.  That's actually gay day.  You know, it's funny, though, when at the end of the night when they do all the fireworks  and somebody yells, look, Tinkerbell.  They all look around confused looking at each other, like no one even looks up. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, Margo.  Yes?  Are there straight people there, too?  Oh, my God.  Today, they had a sign out in front.  They were like, they had their little signs when you walk in the door.  But they're very small.  They were like, this is a special event today that is catered to the homosexual community.  And if you wish to have your money back, you can go and go to any other park.  Why?  Because they try to keep us in one park per day. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, they try to corral you gays up into one area.  So the rooves in the Midwest don't freak out that they're singing homosexuals.  Today, we're all in Animal Kingdom.  Oh, poor animals.  You see the tigers limping.  Oh, God.  Hey, Margo.  Yes?  I don't understand why you gay bastards get your special days.  Hey, they have, like, Kodak Day here, and they have everything else here.  Kodak.  All right.  How about a day for guys that love lesbians? 
[01:17:00]  Well, I guess if you...  Guys who love lesbians day.  I don't care.  Write to Walt Disney and ask them for it.  I don't care.  I'm just here for cocktails and tea.  Cocktails.  You guys want to be treated just like anyone else.  Why do you have to have your special days?  I've never understood that.  Please.  I don't know.  I just come here to, like, ride the ride and see gay men from all over the country.  You know what cowboys today with, like, their health on?  Oh, my God. 
[01:17:30]  It is so hot here.  Hey, is it true that we named it the Epcot Center?  Yes.  Hold on.  Nick is bumming on line eight.  Hey, Nick.  Nick.  Nick.  Nick.  Oh, we lost him.  Ah.  Nick's been saving all year to bring his family to Disney.  Oh, and he's leaving in two days.  He's leaving in two days.  Oh, just in time.  Because then Saturday is Epcot Day.  Uh-huh.  And then...  Oh, no.  So, Sunday is Epcot Day.  Then Monday is Universal Day. 
[01:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, Universal Studios.  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh.  But I'm not staying for that, because that's the night I have in sync, so I'm coming back.  Hey, Jennifer.  Yes.  You're on with Gay Marco.  Oh, Gay Marco.  Let me just tell you.  I went to the Gay Disney Day, like, three years ago.  Oh, my God.  I was so strong.  So, listen, listen, listen.  I don't have gay friends.  I think it's great, but those lesbians are vile.  Oh, they're vile.  We were on line for a ride, a family ride.  And they started singing, what was it, like, Old MacDonald had a farm with a lesbian and 
[01:18:30]  a lick-lick here and a slurp-slurp there.  It was horrible.  And there's kids online?  Like, three- and four-year-old kids are online with their parents.  Oh, I need to hear the dyke version of Old MacDonald now.  It was horrible.  And then all the gay guys, I mean, they were cool.  They were all like, oh, girlfriend, you need to go with those shorts, you know?  But all the dykes were like, hey, honey.  I mean, it was horrible.  It was horrible.  It was horrible.  Hey, Marco? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah?  Is it true at the Epcot Center they have a new 3-D movie, Honey, I Rape the Kids?  No?  Because I saw the 3-D movie of, maybe it was different.  Oh, my gosh.  It was just really bad.  All right.  Really bad.  But thanks.  Hey, guys, and good luck with everything there.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jennifer.  Okay.  There she goes, Jennifer.  All right.  Oh, Jay Disney.  And Marco's there.  Making it even gayer.  Marco. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah?  Are you the gayest guy there?  Please.  No way.  Really?  There are guys here in dresses.  Oh, just flames.  Marco, from a scale of 1 to 10 in the gay world, where would you put yourself in gayness?  Well, didn't you read my column for about three months ago?  No.  Why are you?  Plug in my column.  Why are you?  On foundrymusic.com.  Why?  You mentioned that?  Yes.  There's a whole column I did about how I rate it on.  There's a website called straightacting.com.  Okay.  And you take the test, and it tells you how gay you are on a scale of 1 to 10. 
[01:20:00]  And how gay were you after this test?  Um, I was, I got kind of high on it.  Broke the machine.  It's just too gay.  The machine spit out a thing and say, faggot.  I got an 8.  But it doesn't matter.  An 8?  That's it?  Yes.  An 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.  So you're saying there are people out there gayer than you?  Yeah, there's 9s and 10s out there, too.  Oh, you got a 10.  You need gills, so you don't even have to breathe.  You could just, blah, blah.  No breaks. 
[01:20:30]  No breaks to come up for air.  Gay man with gills.  Kelly.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Hey.  We're talking to Marco.  He's in gay Disney.  Yeah.  Um, I'm just wondering, like, if I went down to Disney, and, you know, I went down with  a family, whatever, and I get down there, and I see that there's this whole gay thing  going on.  Yeah.  Couldn't I sue?  No, there's a disclaimer that says, uh, if you, um...  But they can't, like you were saying before, they don't have a day for straight people.  But what about bisexuals?  Where do they fit in?  Every day is inclusion day at Disney.  There's every day, uh, gay people are able to go, and straight people, and then they just 
[01:21:00]  give it to the gays for a day.  I mean, before you know it, you're going to have, like, Black Day and Puerto Rican Day at  Disneyland.  I mean, what, you know, yeah, you want to be part of everyone.  Everyone else, great.  Just go with everyone else.  All right.  I think they have that.  Actually...  Hey, Marco.  If I may jump in here, actually, this is not a Disney-sponsored event.  What is it?  It is not...  Disney actually has nothing really to do with it.  They just take it over, Ed.  You take it over.  We just come in and take over.  The gays have taken over Disney, doesn't it? 
[01:21:30]  We're here, we're queer, we're fabulous, get used to us.  It's weird that Disney would allow that, too, because they're so strict with their employees.  Hey, Marco.  The employees are all gay.  Hey, Marco.  Yes?  Where do all the gay people come from if you guys can't reproduce?  Oh, hey, guys, too, if I can add, I support you guys with the whole contract thing.  I'm a teacher.  Thank you.  So I understand the whole lack of a contract and how much it sucks.  All right.  Well, we're kind of taking a big chance with what we're doing tomorrow. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, wherever you guys go, you know you have support, you know you have love, blah, blah, blah.  All right, thank you.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Hey, Marco?  Bye.  Yes?  It's a small world ride like a porno movie for you guys?  I don't know.  I'll check it out.  I would think that would just be like porno.  Oh, you did?  Yes, I did.  That's great.  That's great.  You get into those cars after gay day.  Oh, it's more liquid inside the log flume ride than outside.  Oh, stick to your seat.  It's like, what, did I just sit on some gum? 
[01:22:30]  Just hose it down and keep the rides going.  Oh, hose down the webs and keep them gumming.  Oh.  Did you go to the haunted man ass?  That's fine.  You're getting all the parts confused.  Today was Animal Kingdom.  Animal Kingdom.  Yes.  So what did you see, Marco?  Well, we saw the bug movie.  God knows what's going on in those movies and the lights go out.  I mean, because, you know, look, you go, you see girls, guys and girls. 
[01:23:00]  We're talking straight guys, straight girls.  You've got to work up like this rapport.  We all know guys are horny.  Women, it takes a little more to get things going.  But now you've got a bunch of horny guys.  I'm just picturing handies, BJs, like just anal going on in the rides.  It doesn't even matter.  Two to a horse on the carousel.  And you know how the second guy's staying on.  I'm just picturing sex all over Disney.  Did they have a parade down Main Street? 
[01:23:30]  Yes, every night.  There's a lot of people in it and it's the shortest parade ever.  You know what's the best place is that all the park employees who are gay,  they're like so friendly like this week.  They're trying to get as many, you know, ladies in as they can too.  Did they call it the mono-e-mono rail now?  Hey, Pat, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're on the air, my friend, with Jay Marco.  Jay Marco, how are you doing?  I went to Disney like two years ago.  Me and my buddy went out and got loaded and had to head back to our hotel. 
[01:24:00]  He said we're going to hang out by the pool and we get some beers  and we're going to smoke a joint and whatever.  And all of a sudden the security guy's like, hey, you guys are here pretty early.  We're like, what are you talking about?  We're here pretty early.  We thought he was, you know, no lifeguard yet or whatever.  He goes, you guys want me to turn the jacuzzi on so you guys can hang out?  Well, I'm like, yeah, sure.  We went over to the jacuzzi and we're hanging out.  Next thing we smoke a joint, whatever, we leave the next day.  And it turns out it was the start of gay day.  He thought we were two figs hanging out by the pool. 
[01:24:30]  Next thing you know, he's pleasuring me, but the joke's on him because I'm not gay.  That old gag.  You guys are cutting out.  Sorry.  All right, Pat.  Thank you.  Jay Marco's a favorite Disney character?  Pluto.  Pluto.  Because it's closer to Uranus.  Oh, there's drones coming from outside.  You guys have got to be kidding me.  I am packing my kids up as we speak and I'm going down there for a vacation.  Oh, children like chum on Gay Week. 
[01:25:00]  Like chum.  I will kill them.  Just throw your kids out.  They love it.  Marco?  Don't let them near the restrooms.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Imagine the Disney restrooms on Gay Week.  Ah, like a bathhouse.  Hold on.  You can't call them a mother effer.  Hold on.  A father effer.  Hold on.  Jay Marco.  Marco, I apologize for that last call.  That's all right.  We had to hang up on it.  I've been caught worse. 
[01:25:30]  Poor Marco.  Wow.  How does everyone know you're gay down there, though?  Oh, please.  But, I mean, are you guys wearing, like, shirts or something?  Yes.  On Saturday, on Gay Day, actually, Gay Day, you're supposed to wear a red shirt.  Uh-huh.  I have this fabulous...  Matthew, you just make a mistake that day.  You're walking.  You're wearing a goddamn red shirt.  Ha, la, la.  I'll suck for a popper.  I have this fabulous shirt.  I got a French connection.  It's so hot.  I can't wait to wear it.  You would think you guys would be a little more creative with your outfit. 
[01:26:00]  Maybe you'd have everyone wearing the Daffy Duck pants.  Were they trying to just drop down in the back?  Yeah.  Oh, please.  My friend Bucky today, they almost kicked him out because he had this tank top on, and  you could see his nipples.  And they said that you can't wear...  You can't expose your nipples.  Right.  Not in Disney.  I was like, please.  You wear a red shirt, you go to the bathroom, you just get attacked.  You pull out your junk, and it's just like, ow, a smuggish boy.  That's a buffet. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  I have to get going because we're going to this tea dance because one of the guys from  Queer As Folk is going to be there.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jason has something to say.  Jason.  Jason.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You're on with K-Marco.  Yeah.  I happened to go down there one weekend on my accident.  It was...  Something was wrong.  We got in mind.  See all these guys in leather vests, leopard print shirt.  I went to the bathroom.  I was so scared to pull down my pants.  We got out of there as soon as we could. 
[01:27:00]  Run for your flight.  Thank you, Jason.  That's great.  All right, Marco.  Well, have fun in gay Disney.  I'm going to.  And listen, if WNEW needs any scabs, the Gay Marco Alternative Lifestyle Show is ready  to premiere on Tuesday.  Say gay and scabs.  It kind of conjures up images of carcinoma or whatever the hell it is.  All right.  Okay.  Good luck to you.  I love you both.  Oh, great.  Thank you.  Gay Marco.  Hope to hear you soon.  Bye.  We're back from Orlando for Gay Disney. 
[01:27:30]  Gay Disney.  All right.  There he goes.  Gay Marco.  Oh, fa.  He only scored an eight?  What the hell does it take to get a ten?  Do you have to do the test with a junk in your mouth?  Anthony, think about other people that are gayer, though.  Charles Nelson Reilly isn't gayer than Gay Marco?  Could have that little kerchief.  You're on a black hole.  Yeah.  Marco's not walking around with the kerchiefs on.  Oh, Gay Disney.  Oh, oh.  Oh, how's that for a topper?  Oh, oh, oh.  Jesus Christ.  Rick's coordinate. 
[01:28:00]  I mean, that's not...  I guess the tens have to be like you just dress as women.  Like Fire Island, flamboyant, big friggin' hat gay thing.  I don't know.  What are you getting at?  You know, like that big hat gay thing.  Banana apple hat thing that Carmen Miranda would wear.  I learned if you're gayer, you wear the big hat gay thing. 
[01:28:30]  Big hat gay thing.  Right.  You know what I'm talking about all.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, I mean, I'm really open-minded.  I heard you guys talking about the, you know, old lesbians and all not being cute and sort  of reviled.  And what is it?  My landlord, she loves the lesbian, and I hear her at night, and she's really old.  Well, not really old.  I'm not like...  You get to hear an old lesbian having sex?  Two of them, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:29:00]  Like, you know, three or four times a week, you know, and it's loud, and it's usually  like at midnight, so, you know, I'm trying to sleep, and all of a sudden I hear him starting  up.  I'm like, oh, no, not again.  Not again.  Oh.  Yeah, I mean, I'm open-minded, and I know she's a nice person, but, you know, it's just  to hear that over and over, and, you know, I'm a tenant in her place, so I'm paying her  to hear this, and it's just like, oh, God.  Right.  All right.  Very good.  Thanks, Chris.  Is that true, Larry on line 11?  Is that true?  Let me go to line 11.  Larry.  Larry.  Hey, guys.  Listen.  When I was there with my kids, we saw that bug movie, and they had these contraptions 
[01:29:30]  in the bench where, like, the bug's going to bite you, and these little things come out  and stick you in the back and the ribs and right in the can.  So it must be the favorite thing with every bag down there.  It must be waiting out line.  It must be around Disney World for this specific movie.  Just waiting with someone to poke you in the butt.  It's out of control.  I'm surprised Jay Marco wasn't seeing show tunes during the movie over there.  That's funny.  It's got to be some sight just to see that many Fagalas running around Disney. 
[01:30:00]  Well, hopefully they'll release that guy who kills all the gay guys up here in New York  and Staten Island down there for a gay week.  All right, Larry.  Thank you.  See you later.  Bye.  You're like in Spain.  They do the running of the gays down Main Street, USA, and the straight people, like,  running away.  They're just gay guys that they junk out running.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, he got gored.  All right, Rich Voss is standing by to come in to say hi.  I think I just saw Jeffrey Ross walking down the hall.  Ah. 
[01:30:30]  And more of your phone calls, of course.  212-757-1027.  Something is happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my hands?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little thing you're getting into the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Hanson A show.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's a long week season in Sex and the City.  A special tour.  Why is I big? 
[01:31:00]  Are you slowly trying to tell me on the way to lunch?  Two episodes back to back.  Sunday, 23rd, 9 p.m., 8 central on HBO.  Ooh, can't wait.  Oh, can't wait.  Why?  Marco called and said he was in Orlando, but he didn't say what city he was in.  Very good.  All right, Anthony.  Yes.  Autolock Pro.  Yes. 
[01:31:30]  You know a car is stolen every 20 seconds.  It's over 4,000 cars a day.  I wonder if these Autolock Pros would work if you just happen to be a straight guy in Disney for Gay Disney.  Put the damn Autolock Pro on your fly.  You should walk around with an Autolock on your junk so you know when you're in the bathroom, no gay guy could steal your...  Auto.  Autolock Pro.  It's an anti-theft device.  Locks on your brake.  Just walk it around with that on you.  It would be funny if you just have your big Autolock Pro on your fly. 
[01:32:00]  Just say no.  Like, get the head.  It locks on your brake, not your steering wheel.  You know, your steering wheel can be cut through in like 10 seconds.  No time.  A thief's never going to get through your brake.  So Autolock Pro, much better than the steering wheel locks.  Installation, seconds.  It's two simple moves in your brake pedals.  Lock car, undrivable.  So don't waste time with other anti-theft locks.  Get Autolock Pro today.  Police test it.  Cops use it on their own cars.  And, in fact, Autolock designed by a former police sheriff. 
[01:32:30]  And who would know better, Opie?  Autolock Pro's tough.  Drill-proof, pick-proof, freon-proof, saw-proof, bullet-proof, homo-proof.  You've seen it advertised on TV.  Now get your own.  And if your car is ever stolen with Autolock attached, Autolock's going to pay you up to $1,000  towards your deductible.  And a $1,000 reward for information on cars stolen while Autolock's attached.  They're pretty confident, and your insurance may even give you a break for using Autolock  before you park your car tonight.  Buy an Autolock at Strauss Autobahn or Pep Boys at Strauss Autobahn or Pep Boys. 
[01:33:00]  Autolock, it works guaranteed.  Anthony Jack from Queens.  Yo, Opie, if you start broadcasting from L.A., can you be a Dodger fan so the Mets can win some games?  Two, Two from Jersey writes,  More, what did I learn in the last three years?  The invisible man drove the WNAW van until he got his own TV show.  Spaz was not the only one to have sex on the office couch.  Ha, ha, ha, the couch.  The jackass contest died like a soprano storyline.  Ha, ha, ha.  Opie has the best visual impressions on the radio.  He does. 
[01:33:30]  The little nubbins.  And it takes Earl six hours to hang one damn picture.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNAW.  Two, one, two, seven, five, seven, one, oh, two, seven.  Mike, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Over the past three years, I learned two things.  Yeah.  One, all Opie wanted was a sandwich. 
[01:34:00]  A sandwich.  And number two, ONA always win at the end.  Ah, without a doubt.  Good luck negotiating with Clear Channel.  I'll hear you guys on the queue next week.  See you later.  God, people know more than we do at this point, Anthony.  Yeah, but we're just making all this up, right?  That's right.  Of course we are.  Look who's in the studio.  Rich Voss.  Yes.  Hey, what's happening?  He's kind of, you know...  Wait, I was going to...  You know, you're not the only person here.  I was going to go around the room.  Oh, okay. 
[01:34:30]  I'm sorry.  I could just stop and look at me.  I've been here since 10 o'clock this morning.  Wait, maybe.  It's about him.  Uncle in thrush.  Jeffrey Ross in the studio.  Well, well, well.  I'm here for the big going away part.  I thought we had to ban you from the show.  Why is that?  It's not a Jeff.  The audition didn't go well.  That's hilarious.  What are you thinking of playing?  I'm back on in three weeks.  Hey, look at this.  Are you?  I'll give you some pointers.  Here's what you've got to do.  Yeah.  Hey.  That'll help.  It's like...  I smell some jealousy.  You know, just because you guys can't hold a job. 
[01:35:00]  You're going to make fun of other shows.  You've got some...  That's good.  And who's your friend?  That's my son.  My daughter.  I got him on eBay yesterday for $1,100.  Sam Levine.  You might remember him from Freaks and Geeks.  Yes.  I know.  I know I recognized you.  You may remember him from a little stage show they do on 43rd Street. 
[01:35:30]  You can see what this kid does with a plunger.  Hey, I...  I want to go on record and say,  Jeffrey Ross, much funnier on our show.  I guess you're referring to my appearance on  Ed Lever and Dr. Dre in 1993 on Hot 97.  Yeah.  I know.  Much funnier.  That's not allowed to mention.  See, we allow our guests to speak here.  Of course.  And you can be funny on our show.  I really have to go on board and saying,  I don't know what you're referring to. 
[01:36:00]  Okay, good.  So, Rich, you have a CD in front of you.  Oh, yeah.  Before we get started.  You know, it's kind of depressing.  It was kind of depressing.  Like, he doesn't want to plug it right now.  He's going to blow some smoke up our bus,  and then he's going to start talking about his CD.  Now it's kind of...  Start showing.  It was kind of depressing before.  It seemed like everybody was leaving like a Jeff Norris show.  You know?  Oh, God damn.  God, this is...  Oh, thank God.  With that little head, no neck, and a misshapen body,  he looks like a snowman. 
[01:36:30]  Why does it look like a Jeff Norris show around here?  Oh, no.  Because it was depressing.  Because people don't really know what's going on.  Well, yeah.  But the difference is you're working more than 10 minutes.  It's just a matter of time before Jeff Norris calls us out.  Oh, who cares about him?  I would have saw Jay today, but I have a small TV,  so his whole head couldn't fit on it.  Water buffalo head.  I'm telling you, if Norton said it was that big,  he'd never get it up and dice his ass.  You have succeeded in bashing like five comics in 30 seconds. 
[01:37:00]  The irony is those are his five friends in a business.  I'm his only friend that ever helps him out in any way.  I'll even plug this crappy CD.  And he recorded it at a prom show.  You recorded this at a prom show?  You would be surprised, though.  And that's when you met that kid you're with.  He brought this into the comedy store the other night, right?  And the owner of the comedy cellar, Manny, he goes,  I heard they put that CD on Napster and nobody stole it. 
[01:37:30]  This is a guy who's not even a comedian.  Tell him about your CD.  Then Voss pulls in.  He walks in with this box.  Look at this.  He's got a CD box.  Hot off the presses, which Voss I'm killing here?  And he gives a crap record.  He takes the box.  Norton, everybody's making fun of this thing.  There's nobody thanked on here.  Now, one of his friends, he doesn't thank God, 
[01:38:00]  but he thanks the comic Bible.  Okay?  Let me see one of those.  So, wait, here's the best part.  Jim Norton walks in, takes it, looks at it,  flips it over, looks at it again, and he goes,  this is awesome.  Drops on the ground, takes a chair from the comedy cellar,  smashes it into pieces, into a hundred chunks.  Reaches into his pocket, takes out ten bucks,  and says, I just bought the first one.  Well, that's right.  And you can buy these off of RidgeBoss.com. 
[01:38:30]  RidgeBoss.com.  Are you going to make money off this?  I'm making a lot of money.  I'll sell a lot tonight when I'm working at the Stress Factory.  Tonight at the Stress Factory, I'll be selling them.  Hey, you know what?  I'm flattered.  Look at that.  Special thanks, Caroline's on Broadway.  Opie and Anthony.  Second mention.  Dice mentioned us like halfway down.  I even got Rick on there.  Oh, look at that.  Where's Rick?  Right under Parenteau.  There are more people.  Literally or figuratively? 
[01:39:00]  That is funny.  That is really good.  Our buddy's Ron and Fez.  Good.  You're hedging your bets here at NW.  I don't see any Jeffrey Ross mentioned.  It's unbelievable that he left me off back.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  You guys started together and stuff.  I used to open for him.  No, Milton Berle thanked him on his CD, didn't he?  Nice try.  Okay, 0 for 1.  Now, seriously, anybody out there who has any trouble sleeping at all, go to richvoss.com,  pick the CD up.  It's like NyQuil. 
[01:39:30]  It was recorded in NyQuil Vision.  It's on record.  I can't even tell you.  It's coming out on DVD sleep.  Oh, wow.  People bowing to Jeffrey Ross.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Wow.  He's killing me.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, God.  If you write that much for your own act.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Now, when I say something, you guys groan.  I don't know.  It seems like, you know, you could be out of your league there.  Who, Jeff?  Not at all.  I learned everything I know about working a crowd from Rich Voss.  Jeff, right now, here's the deal.  When someone's on fire, you just got to back up and, you know, I'm not going to say you  take like a man again, because you guys destroyed me last time, but he's on fire, so I'm letting  him roll. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  Right.  You know, I got to go with what I, you know.  Oh, man.  Jeffrey Ross, where are you going to be?  Tomorrow night, I got a big show at Joe's Pub.  Yep.  At 8.30.  Joe's Pub is called Black Tie Optional, Jeffrey Ross and Friends.  Nice.  Got a lot of friends coming down.  Sam Levine's going to be there.  Danny Aiello, Adina Menzel from Rent.  Wow.  Sarah Silverman.  Anybody?  Nick DiPaolo.  Anybody we know.  Susie Essman.  It's going to be fun.  A lot of fun.  Very cool, hip, variety show at 8.30 tomorrow night. 
[01:41:00]  Joe's Pub.  Right on.  Coyote Comedy Festival.  Cool.  There it is.  I knew this was going to happen.  Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy.  Hi, Ope.  How are you doing?  Oh, well.  Jeffrey Ross, how are you, man?  I'm great.  How are you doing?  Look, you know, I only met you once, but I want to congratulate you with all your Friars  Clubs.  It's a shame that you're in there.  King of Friars Club next to King of Romp Room.  Rich Boss, you cheap freaking Jew.  You should be arrested for solicitation hanging up there.  I got a box of CDs.  Will you be my friend?  I'll mention Opey's name and maybe they'll buy one. 
[01:41:30]  Loser.  Yeah, loser.  Jack Ruby had a better television career than you.  Okay.  That's pretty good.  Boss, let me ask you something.  How long have you been in comedy, you saber-toothed Jew?  All right.  You stink.  Hey, Rich.  It's Rich.  Shut your mouth.  I know it's hard for a minute.  If you want to see Jeff Norris' act, turn Nick at night on at night and close your eyes.  Yeah, thank you.  That's accomplished.  You want to see Rich Bosses?  There you go.  Rich, let me guess.  Hey, Will.  Let me guess the index for the CD.  Track one. 
[01:42:00]  Want to buy a dryer door?  Track two.  I have two daughters.  Track three.  Paint my face black?  I look like a piano.  Track four.  What is that waitress asking me what she wants?  Original.  Loser.  Instead of spending money on a CD, buy a dental plan, you rat-toothed-rabbit-looking freak.  What was that joke?  They're roasting Voss, by the way, too. 
[01:42:30]  You know what's a shame?  Opie.  Yes.  You know what's a shame?  You got this number.  I was talking.  You know what's a shame?  Okay.  You know what?  Wait, wait.  Rich, do you want me to open a can of worms, you bastard?  Nobody guessed that called Colette.  Oh, that's sick.  Really?  Hey, Rich, you should open with that.  That is really standing-all material, you stupid ass.  You got to pick Otto up.  What kind of you got to pick Otto up?  That's good.  All right, don't try to repeat what I said.  Yeah, okay.  You know what?  All proceeds to Rich and Sheet D's goes to the Holland Hooker Fund so he can get laid. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, man.  Hey, what happened with those girls at the sodium?  Oh, boy.  Oh, they love me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They love my big tooth.  You know what's a shame to open?  Otto was telling me about Rich and Sheet D, and I sat back for a minute, and I said,  You know what?  Good for Rich, man.  He got a CD.  He's climbing the ranks.  You know what?  I hope that whole thing crashes on your head.  You got to sell him to buy diapers for your kids.  My kids don't need diapers. 
[01:43:30]  My kids don't need diapers.  They need diaphragm.  They need to go in the sand glass and they need diapers.  Yeah, okay.  Where are you now?  You're lucky I'm not there because I ripped your head off.  What are you doing now?  Are you priming or putting a finish coat on the house?  Yeah, at least I own.  I don't rent, Cheap Chew.  I'm talking about your work, you loser.  We're going to come to blows, Rich.  You know that.  Uh-huh.  Don't talk sexual with me.  I joke on small bones, Chew. 
[01:44:00]  All right?  I joke on small bones.  You do?  Yeah, I don't eat baby food, you little freak.  No, I don't joke on Edith Bunker impressions.  No, that's original.  That's why I do good with it, Rich.  That's okay.  You do good with it.  Is that what they told you at Pips?  No, it wasn't Pips.  Maybe Caroline.  You know what?  Next time I'm at Caroline's, come by after the show.  I'm going to walk you across the stage so you can get that feeling again.  That would have been a lot of funnier if I didn't stutter on it.  Yeah, I know.  There's only everything you said.  This never gets old with these guys.  Wow. 
[01:44:30]  Never gets old.  There's just this underlying hatred.  No, I like the guy.  I like the guy.  I try to, you know, I do kind of like Jay Moore.  Jay Moore puts all these weak acts on in front of him to make him look good.  You know, like the Dina Colas and that kind of stuff.  Oh, my God.  What are you talking about?  We love my Dina Colas.  I know, so do I.  But, you know, funny is a great guy.  You are a hack, hack.  Jay Moore headlines Caroline's UMC.  Now, listen to me.  I headline there Sunday. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Would you create your mom, dad, daughters, and the guy from Kenmore,  a dryer store?  A joke about a washer?  It's so old.  A crack dealer.  You want to buy a store?  You're going to invest in a dental plan, you retarded Jew.  Now, come on.  He's getting a little angry.  Anti-Semitic.  Yeah, what's up with that?  A little weird.  Got a lot of Jewish people in the studio.  No, yeah, but I don't refer to Jeffrey Ross.  He's talent.  Look at you, brown-nose. 
[01:45:30]  Brown-nose?  You're calling me a brown-nose?  Don't cover.  You're up there.  Let me put O&A on the second line to thank him.  They don't give me more plug time.  No.  And listen, I never call him here to plug.  What?  What did you just tell me last week?  All right, you know what?  Now I'm going to open a can of words.  First of all, before we go on, which sticker stop are you at?  All right, because I got a no.  That's original.  That's good.  That's good.  But at least I earned my keep around here. 
[01:46:00]  I know.  You ought to be a racist for solicitation.  He was helping us out, Rich.  No, that's good.  He was helping you out.  Let's talk about the WWF when you went on and when I went on.  That's because you had a bunch of crack alley addicts there watching you, supporting you.  Oh, and listen, I'm a big act pal.  Oh, you're a big act.  Yeah, look, I even gave you my cell phone number.  So is Paulie Shore.  All right.  Wow.  Why are you so mad, Jeff?  Calm down.  I love you.  You're a good friend.  You know what?  You know what?  I want to hear him open up the can of worms. 
[01:46:30]  I think my...  Shut up, Joe!  I want to hear him open up the can of worms.  I love this stuff.  I was upset last week.  Shut up!  Wait, let him go.  All right.  Hey, he's a freaking...  Shut up!  All right, go ahead, Jeff.  Gorilla Boy.  Hold on, hold on.  You can't say that.  Can I finish that?  How many times have you called me?  Reach.  Last week saying,  Rick never called me back.  I wanted to pluck my show.  I'm driving all the way to Holland  to pluck my show.  He never called me back. 
[01:47:00]  Half a sissy.  Change your tampon.  Wow.  These two.  I didn't get it.  I want Jeff Norris to make fun of Rick and Holland.  Who is Jeff Norris?  That's the question.  Yeah, you know who I am?  What have you done in your career?  Jerk off.  Are you talking to me?  Are you talking to me?  I'm talking to you, you man.  Are you listening to me, you actor in a police uniform?  Let me tell you something.  Okay.  The only speaking lines you got is, what would you like in my coffee?  Okay.  Yeah, that is hysterical. 
[01:47:30]  The only work you got, Rick, I believe.  You're not going to leave your career to me.  When I go on stage, I don't have to go.  You have diarrhea in the mouth.  Listen to me.  When I go on stage, I don't have to go shopping at Tories R Us for punchlines, okay?  I don't either have to.  This is a pathetic prop act.  Get a cummerbun and do a boat.  You're sorry.  I know.  I know.  That's good, Rich.  The buck teeth act works much better.  That's okay.  Rich, let me answer you something.  What have you done in your life, Rich?  You've done a, what, a Target commercial for Union New Jersey? 
[01:48:00]  Wow.  What did you get for that?  Postage stamp?  Oh, wow.  You should close with that.  Yeah, I know.  That's okay.  You're the only guy that's got an audition on New Year's Eve.  What's that?  I get auditions all the time.  Yeah, you get auditions.  I do.  Yeah, Mini Weeds pays more money than you could make in a year with your stupid act.  I think you get laid a lot going, hey, I'm cereal.  I'm a frosted Mini Weeds guy.  You know what I do?  He does a great job with the Mini Weeds commercial. 
[01:48:30]  You're in from Holland, loser.  Okay.  Fall in and weigh me.  I'll pay your airfare and see me hash on stage.  Oh, God.  If I was there, you'd be dead for it.  And you know what?  I don't like you.  Oh, oh.  Now I'm upset.  You don't like me?  Did he hang up?  Oh, boy.  He gets so mad.  What's his problem?  I don't know, but I destroyed him again.  Voss, the winner.  Vince Voss never loses.  Vince Voss.  Oh, my God.  He's kicking the crap out of us. 
[01:49:00]  He's beating him silly.  He flung him off the chair.  And he's beating the piss out of him.  Oh, my God.  He can't be.  He's trying to hold him back, but he is.  Oh, my God.  They're battling.  It's like watching elk.  What?  Wow.  Voss, he laid you out.  He came storming in the air. 
[01:49:30]  Voss, welcome to our...  Is he all right?  Hey, Voss, welcome to our...  Voss, get back on the radio.  That was like a scene out of Mighty Joe Young.  Oh, my God.  Voss was shaking like an Israeli wedding palace.  Wow.  Seth doesn't run that fast to get on stage.  Oh, my God.  Voss, welcome to the demented family, man.  He... 
[01:50:00]  We set you up today.  He flew in.  He flew in.  He didn't stop.  Full speed.  He ran into Voss.  He flew off the chair, onto the floor, and then he starts kicking him.  Holy S.  Voss is going, I'm the champion.  I won that.  He's getting all cocky.  He's raising his arm.  Next thing you know, he turns his head and freaking gorilla boy's coming out of full speed.  And Norris will never let you forget he could snap you like a twig. 
[01:50:30]  He's punching his CD.  That was my copy.  There are chunks of Voss CD all over the studio.  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  You're going to have to do two shows to pay for that.  It never ends.  Wait, get on Mike.  Just to record that.  Get on Mike.  Jeff Norris.  Quiet.  Holy smoke.  You came flying in on him. 
[01:51:00]  Voss, what were you thinking?  You had no clue.  You had no clue.  You had no clue.  We got you good, man.  Hi, Big Cap.  Oh, man.  Wow.  You're officially part of the Demented Family now, man.  We got you.  That had to hurt.  It took me ten times to come in here to get that.  That had to hurt.  That didn't hurt.  No, it didn't hurt that bad.  If that hurt, then I'd kill you.  Let me tell you.  Well, you're probably good.  If you didn't know...  The way he smokes, though, he's still breathing heavy. 
[01:51:30]  I got thrown off the chair.  I saw that.  He kicked on the ground.  That was like a prison rape.  Now I know what you do to your...  When your audience...  Oh, forget it.  No, no, no, no.  No more, no more.  No more.  No more, man.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Give me that piece right there.  He's got a piece of a CD.  It's my favorite bit of his.  A bit of a CD.  The funniest bit.  This little piece right here, it's about, I don't know, the population of Idaho on that 
[01:52:00]  pie chart on USA Today.  That's what I got right here.  RichVoss.com.  I haven't left this art in a long time.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  Classic.  What were you thinking, man?  I don't know.  I saw it.  I came in like a nut.  Oh, my God.  He was in the other studio.  He was in the other studio the whole time, obviously.  Get out of here.  Oh, man.  That was so funny.  Hey, nice.  It's your lucky Opie didn't jump up and punch you in the eye.  He usually does that when people run in the studio.  See, I was in on this one. 
[01:52:30]  Listen, I never seen this.  You know what?  Why?  I've got to take this back.  It's like battle in the middle.  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, boss, because of this, are you going to wrap Opie's car in paper and put a dead fish  on it?  I'll tell you one thing.  If you can get your comedy to your acting skills like that, I'll be as good as you one day.  You'll never be that good. 
[01:53:00]  Listen to me.  Round two coming up.  Ring the bell, Eddie.  We'll knock you tomorrow, boys.  Oh, here we go.  I've got to tell you.  I think you would have tried.  No, I've got to tell you.  When you were charging him, I'm like, wait, we set this up while he was, I didn't, I thought  you were like so pissed that you said, F it, I'm going for it.  I was going to come in and I had something else planned, but there's not a room in the  studio.  I said to Rick, when Rick told me that you were here and he was going to unleash Norris 
[01:53:30]  on Voss, I said, guaranteed, Voss gets hurt.  I go, because you can't play.  Norris, it's hard for him to actually play.  It's like, you know, when they show the bears in Russia and like they're on a talk show  and all of a sudden the bear just mauls the person next to him.  You're like, oh, my God.  So the bear, it's just like, okay.  Right.  You know, he's playing.  Meanwhile, the person's head is off.  That's what you're like.  The last time you showed me a choke move, I'm on vacation, I couldn't talk for two days.  Look how big he is.  I know.  Look at his arm.  Oh, great white gorilla, please don't hurt our village. 
[01:54:00]  You know, but I was sitting here.  That was funny.  You got so cocky after you hung up.  Oh, he's ready to start thinking we're the champion and he gets blindsided.  Once again, I kicked his ass.  You know what, but even if this wasn't a joke, I would have drove in from Jersey to beat him.  I still would have drove in.  Sam Levine crapped his diaper.  Yeah, Sam, you didn't know what was going on.  I'm sorry.  We should have let you in on that.  He's still big.  Right.  I had no idea.  He sounds so small on the phone.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Gary Coleman is big next to you.  Oh, you didn't know either, right?  I was, I was in a second where I go, okay, here's what happened to my head.  I see him coming down.  I didn't even know what he looked like, right?  I was like, okay, radio gag.  I'm safe.  Right.  Because I have been in an era where stuff's gotten weird with the rock and stuff.  Do you know what I'm saying?  I know.  And I didn't even look like a gag when he came flying.  No, no, here's what happened.  I heard stomping, so immediately, like, red alert.  I turned around and I did the karate, like, what's going on?  Then I see him coming, either way I know, radio gag, boss is okay. 
[01:55:00]  And then, after I realized it was not, he wasn't going to get hurt, there was a second  in his acting, in Jeff Norris's acting, where I said, this is real.  Yeah.  I started to move.  You hear that, man?  Special Victims Unit call me as a hostile cop.  You turn around.  You turn around and start to run.  Court authority, don't arrest me again.  You turn around and start to run in the morning radio.  Listen to me.  You are not helping.  You want another smack?  No, not you, him.  Wow.  All right, we got to take a break, bud. 
[01:55:30]  Unbelievable.  Bravo, the Gorilla Boys.  Steve C., did you get all that?  Steve C., videotapes it.  Hey, Opie, is it inappropriate to plug something?  Because I've been nervous lately about the plugs here.  Well, yeah, all right.  You know something?  You earned your applause, definitely.  Can we throw darts at you for plugs?  That old gag.  That was a great gag.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead, Jeff.  Jeff Norris.  Can you say anything?  I will kill you.  And he will.  Saturday, June 2nd, 9 o'clock.  Headlining, Mr. Voss, I might add. 
[01:56:00]  At the Danellon Theater.  Shut up, you'll die.  All right.  June 6th through the 10th, Rascals and Ocean.  You know what that was?  That was like the people at Rascals going,  if you happen to get on Opie and Anthony today,  you can work June 6th.  Now, why are you trying to be in school?  All right.  I thought you were going to plug your family.  He just booked himself or something.  I was still...  Wow.  What did you say?  Rich Voss, Stress Factory tonight.  Yeah.  Showdown.  And richvoss.com for the TV.  I mean, everyone's still hanging. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And Jeffrey Ross, what's up?  I'm at Joe's Pub tomorrow at 9.30.  One show only.  That's it.  And Sam, you just hanging?  I'm with Jeff tomorrow.  I'm very excited about that.  All right.  We're going to talk to you later.  Sam's on my show tomorrow.  Yeah, and we're going to talk to him.  He does good impressions.  A couple of good...  We'll figure something out.  All right.  Stay there.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  One of the seven.  He's feet-sucking-F.  Cool jack-off-ass-F.  Seven, seven, seven.  Opie, on Thursday Sunday, like usual. 
[01:57:00]  Opie and Anthony show.  I love being absolved and then F-ing it all up again.  Ah, Anthony.  Yes, Opie.  We're in the middle of commercials, but I should tell everyone out there in radio land.  Yeah.  Girl's chick is here.  From last week.  The one that wants to have a date with Earl.  This girl is slamming.  Where's Earl been?  I haven't seen him all day.  Earl better not...  No.  Earl better not blow us off.  Go get Earl.  I'm hiding.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait. 
[01:57:30]  Where's Rick?  You've got to hide the girl.  Hide the girl because I want, you know, Earl to be blindfolded or whatever and then, you  know, open his eyes to see what piece of ass wants to have sex with him.  Right.

His other radio show.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I got them both. 
[01:59:00]  1027 WNEW.  And don't worry, all the pieces will fit.  Huh? Huh?  Ah.  212-757-1027.  Dan from Hoboken wants to know if we have to offer Jeffrey Ross $3,000 to take a top off.  I don't get it.  The Kimmy jokes.  We love Kimmy.  Yeah.  Rich Voss in the studio.  Jeffrey Ross.  Sam Levine. 
[01:59:30]  Did Gorilla Boy leave?  Jeff Norris?  He's around here somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to talk to...  We should set this up.  Especially for these guys because maybe they don't know what's going on.  Yeah.  Um...  The Earl thing.  Earl.  Yeah.  Well, we...  Earl denies it.  But we think he's a virgin still.  Earl?  And you know something?  I could give a crap.  You know?  But he's one of these guys that, like, denies it.  And then he comes up with some crazy harebrained story about how he's not a virgin. 
[02:00:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, all of a sudden, he finally fessed up after hours.  And the way we were able to say that he is a virgin and he's lying is, Opie goes, all right,  Anthony, first girl you ever had in your life.  Boom.  It was right off the top of my head.  You remember these things.  Rich Voss, first girl you ever had.  It's a gross story.  Well, what's it?  It was just a name.  It was a seaside.  It was a gangbang.  No way.  I was number two, though.  I was number two.  Then there was a minor.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  We were on the cleanup again.  You know what, though? 
[02:00:30]  Anything after number one in a gangbang is not bad.  Huh?  It's not good.  Well, it depends who you're following.  You know, I mean, I don't know.  It was like Jim Norden.  I didn't know.  Huh?  No, she didn't smell like tape.  Anyway, so we asked him that and he didn't have an answer.  He had no answer.  And then after like an hour, a pound, and trying to get information out of him, he goes,  all right, it was an intern that used to work at the old NEW.  It was on a conference room table.  Now it's just got like this real dirty sex thing.  You know, so it's like the crazy story that you come up with when you're caught. 
[02:01:00]  So we went to the phone.  The girl called up and said, look, I'll go out with Earl.  Because we determined Earl just has this problem.  He's a little shy.  He's not outgoing.  He doesn't know how to carry on a conversation and make the first move.  So we did it for him.  We got this girl who's going to come down and go out on a date with him.  And if all goes well, the guy's going to get lucky.  The girl seemed like she was open to maybe having sex with him if they hit it off.  And, you know, I thought, you know, she'd be kind of piggy.  You did, did you?  Oh, yeah.  A girl that would want to, you know, have sex with Earl and go out on a date. 
[02:01:30]  I'm like, well, she's not going to be a looker.  You see her out there?  She's gorgeous.  Let's bring her in.  What's wrong with her?  Get her in here.  Imagine having sex with someone named Earl anyway.  Oh, Earl.  Earl.  That's a name you crap to.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  But he's a fly.  Don't they all have sex?  Look at that.  And we, okay, here's another thing we did.  They have one.  We said that Earl's ridiculous doing this. 
[02:02:00]  And he goes, no, I don't think so.  So Opie goes, we'll take a poll.  We'll get five black guys and get their average age when they lost their virginity.  And Opie said, I bet it's 15.  I'm Anthony.  Yeah.  They're not even listening to you because the girl just walked in.  I'm explaining to the listeners at home.  It turned out that the average age was 14.6.  Right.  Years old.  So Earl was like way out because he's, what, 30 or something like that?  Wait a second.  31.  Shaniqua.  I'm a virgin, too.  What's your name?  Monique.  Monique.  Look at how nice she is. 
[02:02:30]  Look at the hair.  Wow.  Look how pretty.  We didn't expect you to look like this.  Really?  You're beautiful.  Thank you.  Yeah.  She's like light skin.  Jeffrey Ross, you like the light skin.  Sam's a virgin, you know.  Sam Levine.  Is that your natural hair color, honeypots?  No, it's not.  I thought you were talking to Sam again.  Just talk, Sam.  You don't have to have a microphone.  With no mic to defend myself.  It's very cruel.  It's very cruel.  Jeff, you know you were my first.  We did it at that NAMBLer convention.  Oh. 
[02:03:00]  Come on, man.  You'd be a hit at NAMBLer.  You shouldn't joke like that.  I know.  That monster thing going for him.  Come on.  Hey, how old are you?  I'm 24.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Oh.  And you want Earl, right?  I'm sorry?  You want Earl.  I don't even know what Earl looks like.  See?  But you were very interested, right?  Yeah.  He needs somebody to break him out of his shell.  Right.  And I think you're the girl.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You really do.  You look like, you know, very nice, but you look like you have some wild side to you. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  A lot.  She looks very nice.  She's got the pink and the blonde in her hair.  Yeah.  Very nice body.  Got a little of the, what do you call, a bling-bling around the neck, Opie.  Got the bling.  Hey, let me tell you something, baby.  I'm not late to brothers.  I'll eat to coochie.  Is that track four or five on your CD?  Oh, my God.  Richboss.com for your CD.  Do the tag.  Do the tag.  Oh, my God.  I know it's this. 
[02:04:00]  Who doesn't?  I've got to be nice.  Anybody with a sense of humor.  Norris is writing all these down for the next argument.  They're roasting VARFs next week at the Boston Comedy Club.  Yeah.  I heard about that.  Norton's hosting it.  Okay.  Yeah.  That ought to be interesting.  Well, let's talk about her. 
[02:04:30]  Let's get Earl on the phone.  Earl?  Earl?  Hey, guys.  It's Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Where are you?  I'm just pulling up to Earl now.  Earl's Earl.  Hello, Earl.  How are you doing?  The guys want to talk to you real quick.  Earl doesn't want to come down to meet Monique.  Hold the phone.  Hold the phone.  Earl?  Earl, how are you doing, man?  Hi, Earl.  Good.  Where have you been today?  We haven't seen you all day.  It's like it could be the last broadcast of O&A on N.E.W. today, and we haven't seen you.  Yeah, we thought you cared and stuff.  No, I've been at my desk.  All right.  You're at your desk. 
[02:05:00]  Earl, there's a lovely young lady down here, Monique.  Who would love to meet you.  She's beautiful, Earl.  Yeah.  You want to come down and just say hi?  I'm a little bit busy, guys.  Oh, wow.  Wait, Earl, what could you possibly be doing that's more important than meeting the lovely  Monique?  I'm not saying it's not important.  I'm just like I'm in the middle of something right now.  What are you in the middle of?  Unless it's three strippers.  What are you in the middle of right now? 
[02:05:30]  Pins in my name.  Earl.  Earl, what are you in the middle of?  Seriously.  No, actually, I'm just doing some paperwork.  Paperwork's more important than Monique.  She's getting paid.  I'm not saying she's not.  Well, you're insulting a beautiful young lady that wants to meet you.  I'm not insulting anyone.  Virgin.  Jeffrey Ross, what do you think of Monique?  You mean Lesnique?  What?  There's Lesnique there than Mo. 
[02:06:00]  I see that.  I think she's very pretty.  Thank you very much.  I think you are.  Earl, where do you live?  I live in Austin.  What?  No, I didn't ask.  I didn't ask where your family was launched.  I've got that.  Oh, wow.  Boss, man.  Boss, don't ruin it.  Hey, Earl.  Earl, you're apologizing like a pussy, Rich.  Because she's not a comic.  Yeah, she's not a comic.  Yeah, she's not a comic.  I understand.  Earl, can't you come down here and just...  She can come up here because she's a nun. 
[02:06:30]  Earl, could you just come down and meet her?  Earl, hi.  Walk to the studio.  We're talking ten minutes out of your life.  Why don't we have Monique talk to Earl for a second?  All right.  Monique.  Earl.  Hello.  Hi.  Hello, how are you?  I'm good.  I traveled all this way to come and see you.  I'm quite flattered.  Two minutes.  Earl, we're lining up, man.  I mean, we're giving you first stab at it here.  You're your own C-blocker.  Earl for the future.  I'm C-blocking myself. 
[02:07:00]  Earl.  Earl.  Yeah.  Come on.  Dan from Hobunker wants to know, you're working on the local file or roadshow ID tags?  Earl.  He's making reservations for Disney.  Earl, you can do it your way or our way.  We can play 1965.  Oh, my God.  Not the fire hose out of the hallway.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  You should see him run, though, when we do it.  It's classic.  Earl.  Yes. 
[02:07:30]  What do you think?  I'm trying to be nice.  Well, I made it pretty clear.  Well, I thought I made it pretty clear about kind of like getting fixed up and blind dates.  We're not talking about blind dates.  No.  We're talking about coming and meeting a girl.  That's it.  We just want you to meet.  Say hi.  We're setting our sights real low here.  Monique doesn't even know what you look like.  Exactly.  I just want to say hi.  Come on down.  Earl.  Oh, my God.  Earl.  I can't believe he's got to be talked into this like this.  Earl.  Yes.  Just say hi. 
[02:08:00]  That's all I am.  I said hello.  In person.  In person, man.  Please.  Does she got booty, Jeff?  Uh-huh.  I can't see the booty from here.  You're just...  Yeah.  Look at the booty.  Look at that.  Wow.  Bam.  Bam.  Earl.  Bam.  Bam.  Wow.  That was good.  Earl.  I got a black magic woman.  Earl.  Yes.  What do you think? 
[02:08:30]  Monique looks just like Shrek.  Earl, walk.  See, now, Opie, you're going to run it.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Just get...  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  I hung up.  All right.  We'll go to the other phone.  Rick.  Yeah, I'm right here next to him.  He isn't doing anything.  We have backup phones.  He's got a freaking stack of Pringles that I'm eating now because he's just sitting here  looking at his computer hoping the day goes by so he can cash another check.  No, you're calling Dago.  Yeah, you're the Dago.  Even gay Marco would come and look at her. 
[02:09:00]  Look at you.  Well, Sam.  Rick, what's going on?  Is Earl a little pissed?  No, he's just sitting here like a tool.  Like a repressed gay guy.  Sean in line 10 says she's not Earl's type.  She's female.  Oh, see?  Now all that's going to get kicked up because Earl, doesn't he want to come down and meet  her?  What is that all about?  Where are you going, Ben?  Yeah, Ben's getting pissed.  Hey, guess what?  I figured out what a number 10 on gay Marco's test looks like.  Talk to...  Rick, talk to Earl. 
[02:09:30]  Come on, Earl.  It's a chick.  It's a girl.  She won't bite you, man.  Earl, she's really hot.  She might bite you.  Well, she's hot, too.  Would you flash us or anything?  Come on.  All right.  I figured we'd ask.  Earl, she's a lady, too.  She won't flash us.  He's got it.  He might enjoy that.  How old is she?  31.  I just took the club away from him.  31.  He does have a club next to his dad.  No, he doesn't anymore.  I just gave it to Ben.  Earl. 
[02:10:00]  Dude, what kind of guy has got to be talked into coming down and meeting a beautiful girl?  What kind of guy?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl, we'll send Gorilla Boy down there.  Uh-oh.  What's wrong with you?  There's Ben.  I don't know.  What's next to the club?  Vaseline?  Come on down here.  Earl.  He's not coming.  Fine.  Earl, come down.  He said fine.  Wait.  He hung up again.  We'll go to another phone.  Rick?  Rick?  Wow. 
[02:10:30]  He uprooted himself from his chair.  He's heading down the hall.  All right.  Earl is coming down here.  All right.  Hold on.  Should we hide Monique?  Yeah.  Do you want to meet Monique or do the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge?  Jesus.  Should we hide her?  Yeah.  Hey, get over here and bend down.  Oh.  Opie.  Not about you, Opie.  It's about Earl.  Boy, this is radio.  Hey, bend down over there.  It's like Billy Club.  Hide behind this stack of unsold Rich Voss CDs. 
[02:11:00]  Wait.  She's going to...  Hold on.  How are we going to do this?  Wait.  Make sure Earl doesn't come walking in.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Just kind of duck down there.  There you go.  Hold on.  Duck down so he can't see.  Duck all the way.  Wow.  There you go.  He's got red panties on him.  You like that?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Look at you.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck.  Mm-hmm.  Nicey-nice.  All right.  Let's bring Earl in.  Bring Earl in.  All right, Earl.  Get on the mic.  All right, Earl.  Hold on.  He looks all angry.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold the phone. 
[02:11:30]  Why are you pissed?  We haven't done anything bad to you today.  We just have this beautiful girl that we want you to meet.  Tell me why you're pissed, seriously.  We're not asking much from you.  Take the grin off your face.  And we can understand sometimes you're pissed off at things we do.  Fine.  This is not even in the realm.  Earl, we know we push you hard.  We know that.  But we're not pushing you today.  No, I just hate getting...  I hate getting fixed up.  I hate it.  You're talking about just meeting her.  We're not saying you guys go out or anything.  She might not even like you.  All right.  Who knows? 
[02:12:00]  Are you all right?  I want you to ignore...  You're okay with this, Earl?  What choice do I have?  None.  But are you okay with it?  Earl, she doesn't bite.  It's a girl.  I don't think she's going to bite.  I just hate...  It sounds like we're making them eat dog do or something.  I know.  Are you cool with black chicks?  Yes.  She's kind of light-skinned black, right?  I'm after that.  Good.  Thank you, Jeff.  No, I'm serious.  You're listening to them up.  Look at them smiling.  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[02:12:30]  I know I'm not going to win with a room full of comedians.  There's a matter and Vaughn.  You're a mic, eh, now.  You're a peed, eh.  Does it matter if she still smells like Jay Moore?  Oh, come on.  They all get there sooner or later.  Come on.  I know Jay a long time.  Can I do track six off Rich Voss' CD?  Yeah, go ahead.  Black guys won't eat the coochie unless it's fried. 
[02:13:00]  I just did that one, stupid.  I thought you did the...  I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought.  Look at the size of your head.  What are you auditioning for?  You want another Beaton?  When you walk out here, can you...  Mel Blanc's looking for a new rabbit.  Rich.  That's good.  Earlier, weren't you saying his head was little?  I don't know.  Now it's getting shaved.  I'm trying to keep up with head socks.  At least my teeth match my head, rabbit.  Why is he coming at me again?  You look like...  The funny thing is, it is like, you are like a rabbit, and he's like Ravishing Ronald. 
[02:13:30]  Remember that guy?  He's the nature boy.  Ravishing Ronald.  Oh, brother, there goes me bread and butter.  We're gonna have a rabbit.  He pulls the hairnet over his head and starts boxing him.  Yeah.  Here, give Earl that mic and turn that mic around so Monique can say hi to Earl.  Monique is still hi.  Turn that mic around down below here.  Earl, it's trying to meet your... 
[02:14:00]  Smile, Earl.  Smile.  Give it your best treat.  Yeah, Earl, you don't want to look...  Now, wait a minute.  Don't get up yet.  This is her first impression of you, Earl.  You don't want it to look like you just got out of lockdown.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Okay, kind of look happy.  Loosen up a bit.  Loosen up.  You want a shot?  You want some Jaeger?  We got some ice cold Jaeger.  Nice.  Want a hit?  What do you want?  You want some heroin?  What do you need?  David, what's up?  Hey, Earl, stop being the look, man.  You're making the brothers in battle.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  Wow.  Earl says, go after yourself.  David, I have hotty mouth.  I apologize for the anger.  Earl, hotty mouth.  Now you look angry again.  Yeah.  You don't want to look angry.  Loosen up.  Loosen up.  I'm not tolerating stupid listeners.  All right.  Loosen up.  Loosen up.  Jesus Christ.  I hang up on everyone.  Looks like we're going to have a show.  All right, Earl.  Here comes the moment now.  So just, you want first impression to be nice.  Nice.  Okay. 
[02:15:00]  Earl, you're slant.  There you go.  You're slant.  I always slant.  Stand straight up.  Stand straight.  Move the mic up so you can talk while you're standing up.  Look at him smiling.  That's good.  See?  All right.  There you go.  All right, Monique.  Quick, before he gets pissed again.  There you go.  All right.  Stand up.  Earl.  Nice.  Right?  Lovely, Monique.  Oh, look at her face.  Yeah.  Hey, Earl.  Hello.  Thank you for coming down.  You're welcome.  That's nice.  Okay.  Oh, you stop it. 
[02:15:30]  So, Earl, what do you think of the lovely Monique?  Come in.  Quite lovely.  Thank you.  Yeah, look at that.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Take it to a Rich Voss show.  Earl, would you like to say something to Monique?  What?  Hello.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Thanks for coming down.  Monique?  How are you?  What do you think of Earl?  I think he's gorgeous.  Oh.  There you go.  And what do you think of Monique, Earl? 
[02:16:00]  She is, she is, she is, I can't even talk.  See?  Now, would you be against, now, I'm not setting something up in Stonia, but would you be against  getting a Hummer?  Jeez, I'm trying to help the guy out here.  Would you be against, you know, maybe hooking up to go and have dinner somewhere?  I'd be open to that.  You'd be open to that.  And, Monique, what do you think?  Yes, I would.  Wow.  360, this guy's in.  I know.  I know, right?  Yeah.  I think he's getting kids in the future.  All of a sudden, Earl turned into Billy Dee Williams. 
[02:16:30]  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Harry White.  Right.  I saw three kids in her car downstairs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus, Rick.  We've run out of microphones, unfortunately, in the studio.  Yeah.  Okay, so you wouldn't be against anything like that?  Earl, look at those lips.  Yeah.  She's got the lower lip drag, like Dice would say.  Dice, thanks.  The drag.  You know, on the lower lip, you need something with some drag. 
[02:17:00]  She's got that, Earl.  Monique, you high.  And if you don't mind driving with Otto, Jeff will drive you to your date.  Sorry, I stepped over that one.  That was good.  That's all right.  Rich will take you, but you have to look through pictures of his kids.  I mean, I can reproduce.  We don't make that sound like a good thing. 
[02:17:30]  We don't want to look at your kids.  We don't want to look at the wall in your bedroom.  All right.  I'm going to go have a cigarette now.  You didn't get that?  Nice hat.  Good.  Nice.  Nice.  Pathetic.  What does that mean?  Look at the wall?  All right.  All right.  Well, it's not about you.  It's not about you.  You're doing for another beating at 6.05.  It's about Earl and Monique.  I've never seen Earl happier.  Yeah, I know.  Something has come out of Earl today.  Look at that.  It's not what's coming out of him now.  She's got the J-Lo glasses on. 
[02:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  She's got, like, the, yeah, look at those lips with, like, the stuff on them.  It's, like, shiny and stuff.  You could call him Earl Daddy.  Earl Daddy.  Earl Daddy.  Yeah.  So, Monique, where do you want to go with Earl?  I don't know.  I'm not too familiar with the city.  I'm not too familiar with the city.  Earl, you know any good spots, maybe?  Get some dinner or something?  Ben knows Manhattan.  What do you think, Ben?  Bye-bye.  All right, Ben. 
[02:18:30]  Earl, comment?  My God.  That's awful.  That's horrible.  Everyone knows it's churches.  Oh.  Mm-mm.  No.  Where do you want to take Monique?  Head-drung a complete...  Wait a minute.  I'm a big dick black.  Stop it.  Earl?  I don't know.  I'm drawing a blank.  I don't know where to go around here.  Joe's Pub.  Come on, man.  Jeffrey Roth. 
[02:19:00]  Joe's Pub's a really cool spot.  He doesn't look like Shrek, Monique?  No, he doesn't look like that.  Man, he just got on his good side.  Yeah, Earl.  He doesn't like digging you.  He doesn't like the Shrek comparison.  I like it.  How dare you guys?  Yeah, but you paint his face green.  It's pretty close.  No.  No.  Earl?  So now, let's say you two went out, right?  You hit it off good.  Are you the type of girl that would really take a lot of work to maybe get some kind of sexual  favors going on or something?  A lot of work on my part or on his part?  On his part. 
[02:19:30]  Like, what does a guy got to do before you'll feel a romantic?  Well, I don't know how mutual it's going to be.  I want to know how easy you are.  Well, it all depends.  It all depends on the sex.  At least he's being honest.  All right.  What's it take?  I mean, I consider myself to be a very sexual person.  Oh, God.  I like to have sex.  You like having sex?  I like sex.  What's the shortest time between meeting someone and having sex you've ever had?  Maybe six hours. 
[02:20:00]  Six hours.  It's now six o'clock, Earl?  By midnight?  You could be having some fun if you play your cards, right?  I mean, you basically have to feed me, get me drunk, you know, show me a good time, and  then we'll see.  What if he's not hung too well?  There's ways around that, you know.  My mom always tells me, if you can't stick it, lick it.  Oh, and I love it if you're listening.  That's supposed to just stamp you, do that, Joe. 
[02:20:30]  You can't stick it, lick it.  Right.  Of course it is.  Wow.  You're not just after Earl for the benefits.  No, that's a big thing in the community, right?  Well.  I must warn you, Earl.  My man got benefits.  I got to warn Monito, Anthony.  Yeah.  Earl doesn't have much cheddar.  He's got some cheese whiz.  Oh, we'll take up a collection in the studio.  That's all right.  We'll take up a collection. 
[02:21:00]  I'll throw a couple of bucks in the pot so these guys can have food without a dumb food  and drink.  What's your poison there, Monique?  What do you like to drink?  I like Bacardi 151.  Oh, right.  Oh, my God.  That's drunk in seconds.  That's like a...  That is a great liquor.  And you like it straight up.  Straight up.  Like a Kool-Aid chaser?  Straight up like a man.  Kool-Aid chaser.  Anthony, I believe we have some Bacardi in the back office.  Oh!  Stinky?  There you go, Stinky.  We got Bacardi in the bar that is our office. 
[02:21:30]  He's already gone before he does it.  That's nice.  Earl?  Earl, you getting those butterfly feelings?  Like, holy crap, this could happen?  I got butterflies already.  Yeah?  Yeah, that happens when you start really thinking you're going to close the deal or something.  Right.  We're like your agents here.  We're not even going to ask for 10%.  Bring your fingers in tomorrow.  I hear that.  I hear that.  Uh-huh.  Earl, you haven't said much. 
[02:22:00]  Monique has opened up to you a bit.  What kind of hairstyle are you sporting?  Well, I don't know.  I just woke up one morning and decided I wanted red and yellow.  I mean, you know, I'm talking below the waist, baby.  Oh.  You know, what kind of hairstyle are you sporting?  Oh, natural?  Black, baby.  A full rack?  Is it like a pool rack full of Afro hair down there?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah?  It's low.  It's very much cropped.  Cropped?  We don't like Fidel Castro eating a London broil.  You know? 
[02:22:30]  That looks a little unruly.  All right.  Okay.  It doesn't look like Billy Preston.  Yeah, we don't need that.  It's neat.  Looks like you have links on the Mod Squad's head and a leg lock.  Right.  No?  Okay.  Does it look like Allen Iverson?  No.  No.  You don't dye that, though, do you?  No.  That would be cool, though.  I don't dye it yet.  Imagine that.  She takes her dress off, her pants off or something, and you see her hair down there  is exactly the same color.  No Bacardi?  Giving me an idea.  What do we got?  What do we got?  Let's throw some stuff in front of her.  Rum. 
[02:23:00]  We got...  Rum.  Rum.  What is it?  Dominican rum?  You like the Dominican rum?  Yeah.  Do you need a glass?  That's a Jaeger.  Mm-hmm.  You need a brown paper bag?  No.  Don't drink too much of that Dominican rum.  Then your electricity will be cut off.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Monique, what do you like about Earl, now that you've seen him, like physically?  He is very much muscular and so sexy.  Looks like Bobby Bonilla, doesn't he? 
[02:23:30]  No, wait a minute.  That's Earl.  You're looking at Norris.  Yeah, we're talking about the black guy.  Yeah.  Are you a Yankee fan?  Monique, you a Yankee fan?  Yes, I am.  Nice.  Right there, you're in, too.  Perfect height.  Perfect height.  Would you actually one day maybe like to go to a Yankee game with Earl?  Yeah.  Earl could get tics, right?  Would you be opposed to going to a game with her?  Imagine you strut into the stadium with her on your arm.  You're dressed like an empire.  You'll do it again. 
[02:24:00]  You're right.  Can't win with a room full of comedians.  That's right.  Can't win.  And Rich Voss.  Of course.  Anthony, we'd send him to Paisanos, but we know how Joey feels about, you know.  Chuckle, Burkett.  Yeah, exactly.  You're a ditsou.  I'm moving on.  All right, Tony Soprano.  My God.  My God.  Earl, work it.  Work it, Earl.  Yeah.  Work it.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Earl, she's drinking already.  That rock.  I mean, really, when you're really sick, I can buy a gift.  Really.  I can't buy a birthday.  Yeah.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Cousin.  More and more waves.  Come on.  The lights are now all nice and dim.  Music and Earl. 
[02:25:00]  Now she's dancing.  I'm seeing you moving.  Yeah.  I'm a retired dancer.  You're what?  I'm a retired dancer.  She's a retired...  Wait a minute.  She's a retired dancer.  Where'd you dance?  Many different spots all over.  The last club that I worked in was in New Jersey called Knockers.  Knockers.  Knockers, Earl.  Oh, wow.  Would you be opposed if we put on some music that you would normally hear in a club of maybe  coming out of retirement for a little bit and doing a dance for Earl? 
[02:25:30]  Maybe.  Oh, wow.  Why don't we set up the strip club?  We'll take a break and we'll set up the strip club.  We'll get the boombox and some Motley Crue music.  Jeffrey, you didn't realize.  You just push a button and this place turns into a strip club.  It's a magic.  It's a magic.  It's a magic studio.  A black strip club, which is even better.  Yeah, baby.  The best.  Less rules.  Nice.  Monique, sip on that and then we'll get the strip club ready and you show Earl some moves  to close the deal.  Earl, you all right? 
[02:26:00]  Earl, you got a boner?  Lap dance.  Earl, it's going to take this.  You realize that.  You got to put some time into it.  We'll even give you some money.  You could sit down on one of the chairs.  You could give you a little lap dance and you put some money in.  Your moment's chance audition will have to wait until tomorrow.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Stay in age.  Wow.  You know, a blue man group ripped them off.  Very good.  Let's take a break.  Monique is already, like, working her boots. 
[02:26:30]  Heh, heh, heh.  Yeah.  Do you need to go to the stairwell before the strip club thing?  For what?  You know what the stairwell is?  It's cold for some things.  No.  I don't smoke.  You don't smoke the weed?  No.  That stinky's out of the picture.  Wait, where's the stairwell?  You know what?  I'm always going outside.  Ah, the stairwell.  What are you talking about?  That's the Mike Adams Memorialist stairwell.  That's right.  Your contract is up because you guys are breaking all the rules. 
[02:27:00]  We have to take a break, okay?  Yes.  Jeffrey Ross in the studio.  Sam Levine.  Rich Voss and the gang.  Monique and Earl next.  The Opie and Anthony show.  This happens to be one of my favorite shows.  I wanted to listen and learn.  I learned that from my ride home, I'm going to wear the pants because I think that your  show is so funny, I'm going to pee myself every day.  That's another goal.  We have everybody wetting their pants on their drive home.  Russell.  Dom.  Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?  1027 WNEW. 
[02:27:30]  Darren, real fast.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you that Opie, you know what happens to princesses that fall in  love with Shrek.  Very good.  We'll find out next with Earl and Monique.  That's right.  Say how to Monique for me.  Sounds like a pretty lady.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Have a good time, guys.  I love her sexy voice, too.  She is very, very sexy.  You are correct.  She's very hot.  Yeah.  She's turning me on over the radio.  See, I've never happened that before.  That's a...  Retired dancer. 
[02:28:00]  She's greasing up her hands for some reason.  Wow.  What are you doing?  That's too much information for me.  I put lotion on.  Oh, just lotion?  She's putting some lotion on?  Is she sure she's not lubing up something else?  It looks like some kind of gliding thing.  Oh, nice.  A little lotion.  A little lotion.  Wow, she's rubbing her whole body, Earl.  Still embarrassed, Earl?  Maybe if you can't get some spots on your back, maybe Earl could help you out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Earl, put those big old hands to use...  Jesus Christ, don't they? 
[02:28:30]  Jimmy the Greek.  Anthony.  Yes.  Sacker 2, the world's strongest February.  It's spring.  And, yeah.  Oh, oh.  Monique, did you use it, too?  Yes.  What the hell did you need it for?  Well, I was about 20 pounds heavier.  Yeah.  You were?  20 pounds heavier.  And...  Then you gave birth.  No.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I assumed.  I assumed wrong.  Oh.  I still use it, actually.  Thank you, Earl.  I still use it in the mornings when I'm tired and don't get back going to work or hungover or something.

[02:30:00]  The WNEW Sports Guys.  Anthony, we're almost ready.  We're setting up the O&A Strip Club.  Yes.  Can someone get me an Icy Cold Sam Adams?  Oh.  Ah.  Look at that tie-in.  Oh, wait.  Let me see the copy.  Oh, it's for Sam Adams.  We've got a library for Sam Adams.  I don't even know.  Right now, Sam Adams is Icy Cold.  I'm cold somehow.  Patriot.  Sam Adams.  Oh, wow.  You're dire and alcoholic, by the way. 
[02:30:30]  It's like my great-grandfather used to say, Earl's got to get laid.  Nothing tastes better than Cold Sam Adams.  What's going on over there, Earl?  You're not really talking to her anymore.  Oh, they were talking a little bit.  Earl, you all right so far?  Loosening up.  He's okay.  He's all right?  Monique, how's the room?  It's very good.  You're going to help Monique get her groove on?  Back?  Why?  Earl's going to get his F on.  Mm-hmm.  Right, Earl? 
[02:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  Hey, Monique, what song do you want to dance to?  Retired dancer in.  Yeah.  I really don't know anything.  What was it, an injury got you out of the business?  No, I just couldn't do it anymore.  I was working a full-time job and doing that at night, every night, and I just couldn't  do it anymore.  Wow.  Gave up some good cash, though, huh?  Yeah, I miss it.  Yeah.  What song would you like to dance to?  You must have had a favorite, Indiegata DeVito.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I really don't have a favorite.  It's anything. 
[02:31:30]  You're hanging with a bunch of white boys, so they don't have much of a selection.  We just know Motley Crue whenever we hear strip clubs.  My boy is my soul.  You want to do Girls, Girls, Girls by Motley Crue?  Whatever.  That's a good one.  Anything.  All right.  It doesn't matter.  Two dancers can dance.  We should wait until Limbo Norris gets in his car.  All right, Anthony.  Yeah, Sam Adams.  To make it like a real strip club, can I pay 18 bucks for my cold Sam Adams when it comes?  That would be fun.  If you care about your guests, serve only the best.  And show some style.  Serve a beer that's different from all the other beers out there. 
[02:32:00]  Sam Adams.  Trade up to Sam Adams for all your summer parties.  Sam.  Yes, Jeffrey.  It's just funny.  Like, you know the old folklore?  Like, Sam Adams is like, when he was a young boy, his mom was like, Sammy, drink your beer.  One day you're going to be a famous.  Sign the Magna Carta.  Whatever you're going to do.  Sam Adams was drunk when he signed it.  I just went outside and smoked some pot.  Did you?  Cool.  Anything's possible, man. 
[02:32:30]  I sure you have it.  All right.  We're getting ready for the big dance.  Yeah, Monique dances for Earl next.  A little lap dance action, right, Earl?  We've got to get the couch in here.  Yeah, pull in the couch.  All right, we're pulling in the couch.  What kind of show is this?  It was like somebody pouring hot wax in your ears until your brain was completely bummed.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, last break of the show, Anthony.  We're going the distance.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[02:33:00]  Rich Voss in the studio.  He came by with his new CD.  You can go to richvoss.com to get this.  Is he going to be in stores?  Yeah, I don't know when.  All right.  I'll be selling at the Stress Factory tonight.  And Rich is going to be at the Stress Factory tonight.  Jeffrey Ross, who will be appearing, oh, God.  And Joe's come.  Thank you.  Tomorrow night.  Black Tie Optional, that's what it's called.  It's a variety show.  Dressed to impress.  You don't have to wear tux, but don't wear sandals. 
[02:33:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Right, I hear you.  It's going to be a very cool show.  And Sam Levine's going to be with you?  We'll be here tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Sam's going to read the Vagina Monologue.  I'm very excited about that.  Yeah?  And I think it's going to be a big hit.  A lot of fun guests, special guests coming on.  Cool.  Joe's Pub, one night all-in.  Ticket to...  All right, hold on a minute.  What's going on outside?  What's happening outside?  Oh, my God.  Hey, Sam, I've got to ask Sam.  I love asking the newbies.  What do you think of this place? 
[02:34:00]  I think it's insane.  I love the heroin cart over here.  It's great.  Yeah, you're just like...  And all the works are clean, so you don't have to worry about any disease.  I had no idea you guys did the show totally naked.  Yeah, completely.  It's really liberating.  Yeah, and we jerk it during our commercial break.  Yeah.  Oh, that's who that was.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  She gave me lotion.  I didn't know what to do.  She gave each other the reach around.  Whatever.  Whatever it takes.  Yeah, like we would get naked in front of a black lady.  Sam is the 18-year-old.  18 years old.  19, buddy. 
[02:34:30]  19.  Is he 19?  That's legal in Vancouver.  19.  Look at you.  Gave him a special permission to be in the Friars Club.  Oh, really?  Special dissertation.  Here's the balls of a 90-year-old man.  That's why I'm true.  I sit down on the toilet right in the water.  They're very cute.  20 little brothers.  Oh.  All right.  Also, we have Earl and Monique.  Monique, are you getting a little buzz there?  No.  No?  Well, then we've got plenty more where that came from.  There you go.  That's why I drink 151, because, like, two shots of that and you're nice. 
[02:35:00]  Well, let's calculate the percentage and just readjust the drink accordingly.  I'm getting picked up, though.  Oh, you're getting picked up?  Yeah.  Who do you want to call the cops?  No cops.  Earl?  Yo.  Are you still happy with Monique and the situation you're in?  I am.  She's ready to dance for you in just a little bit.  Mm-hmm.  Let her enjoy the room a little longer.  We've got the couch.  The place looks like a strip club now.  I just saw something outside.  Just thoroughly.  Oh, you guys.  Cheer up, Earl. 
[02:35:30]  No.  No.  All right, hold on.  All right, hold on.  We're saving this.  All right, what were you laughing at, though?  We have to save it.  No.  Can you give us a hint?  No.  I've never seen you laugh hard.  No.  Yeah, they were freaking out.  I got a clue.  You're going to need glasses again.  No, I know.  You're going to curse Dr. Philosoph.  I know.  It's in your eyes.  Wait, I know who's here, but why is it so funny?  No.  Do what you're doing.  Keep going.  Do this.  Hot girl.  Go with it.  No, we've got to bring him in.  No.  We have to, because Monique needs a little more time. 
[02:36:00]  Come on, we're running out of time.  I swear to God.  You.  No, I don't know.  I'm fine.  Oh, yeah.  She's great.  I'm fine.  Liquor.  And talk for a second.  Because I got to.  I got to.  Please.  God.  No.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm just going to ask Ben something off air.  All right.  Ben.  Look at these executives.  Call.  I know.  He's got to.  He's got to take himself off the air.  Ben now giving open information.  Yeah, I know.  That's what you got to do.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, listen.  Trust in Rick. 
[02:36:30]  No, no.  I'm.  Rick, I have to do it.  I have to trust Ben.  Ben said you have to do it.  All right.  Let's just do it.  We're running out of time.  We really don't have time to be screwing around not doing something.  All right.  Yeah.  So do something.  Rick.  Oh, my.  Just.  Wait.  Open the door.  Let's go.  Don't bring them to the door.  Blast them at one.  Rick is trying to do bits.  Just.  Hurry up.  Just stand right here.  No, no.  No, no.  What are they doing?  Just bring them in.  Just bring them in.  Bring them in. 
[02:37:00]  It's the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, my God.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley have come down.  All right.  What did you do to your hair?  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus Christ.  You look like Captain Kangaroo.  Hey, it looks good.  It looks good.  Guys, please don't go.  We're going to miss you guys.  It looks good.  So there's hepatitis.  Well, wait.  Do you have hepatitis?  No.  I'd rather have it than that hair. 
[02:37:30]  You look like.  I don't know who that is.  You don't know who that is.  I don't know you.  And you will never know me.  I don't want to know you.  It's when the beach falls walk.  I don't know.  You tell me.  Look at you.  What's wrong with me?  You're birth control.  No.  Yeah.  Why?  Do you take it?  Huh?  Do you take birth control?  I'm just looking at you.  Oh, my God.  Why?  What are you?  You look like a Dr. Seuss character.  Let me tell you one thing.  You are Dr. Seuss character.  When guys go south of you, they go, I won't eat here. 
[02:38:00]  I won't eat there.  You are Dr. Seuss character.  Get out of here.  Look at you.  I thought I had an overbite.  What do you brush your teeth with?  A paint roller?  Look at you.  What do you brush your teeth with, honey?  Don't ever talk to me like that.  Do you know who I am?  I don't want to know who you are.  Do you know why?  I know, but you don't sound very funny.  I'm not funny.  I like Andrew Dace Clay, and I like Jay Moore.  Good, good.  But you don't sound anything like that.  Two washed up hats.  No, you look like you're washed up.  Yeah, I don't like you.  So does your hair.  It looks like...  My hair looks better than yours. 
[02:38:30]  It looks like a perm with A's.  You look like you need role game pretty soon, honey.  Listen, just sit there and look funny.  I don't have to say it looks funny.  I can look at you, but you don't look funny.  Shut up, honey.  I can't look at you to say goodbye to an open-air.  I didn't come up here to listen to you.  Because you don't sound very funny.  Well, that's wrong.  You were going to listen to me.  I'm not going to listen to you.  Because you don't sound too funny.  When the instructors say crunches, you didn't mean Nestle. 
[02:39:00]  Let me tell you one thing, honey.  I lost 8 pounds in the last month.  Yeah, it looks like you found them.  And you gave me your hair.  No, well, let me tell you what I'm going to get in there.  All right, I'm always marrying.  You seem like marrying.  The hair's nice.  All I need is a face mask and some Dallas Cowboy stars on the side.  Anthony, I'm telling you, I hope tomorrow you ain't here, but I hope Opie's here tomorrow.  But it looks good.  Marion, I'm over here.  I love your new look.  I know. 
[02:39:30]  Thanks.  You look lovely.  8 pounds down.  8 pounds down.  Look at that.  Still going down.  It looks 50 to go.  Very good.  It looks good, Luke Skywalker.  Jeffrey Ross.  Jeffrey Ross.  Hold on.  Hold on, Marion.  I've changed since March.  That's Rich Voss.  He's been on a show a lot.  I'm home, so.  All right, and this is the counted Jeffrey Ross.  Hello.  This is the retarded Laverne Shirley.  I don't know why you're doing with that guy.  That guy sounds like a real good boy.  I am a nice guy.  He sounds like a real good boy.  I have a reputation for being a sweetheart. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Are you the retarded Laverne or the retarded Shirley?  I'm the Shirley.  She's the retarded Laverne.  I'm the first.  I thought you.  I'm a little bit more like a.  More sanctionish?  A little bit more like that.  It's like the cover of retarded Frampton Comes Alive.  It's like what you're doing.  You know why?  It looks like.  We just got off the train, guys.  And we walked here from the train station.  You know what?  To me.  Which one's the little one? 
[02:40:30]  You are a train station.  Let me give her some air time.  Marion.  Could you imagine?  Hey, look at that cab getting out of that cab.  Jeff, if you and her had kids, they would look like hush puppies.  She's telling me she wants to talk.  Oh, my God.  She can talk?  Oh, man.  I'm going to put a stick in there.  How are you guys doing?  I hope you guys do not leave.  That's all I have to say.  Thank you, Kathy Bates. 
[02:41:00]  I'm going to be a Norman Bates.  Seriously, are you guys on the far side of that cartoon in the newspaper?  When did they finish filming Lord of the Rings?  Look at how blacked it.  Oh, my God.  We don't have time to read the papers.  You guys look like a before and a before answer.  We read the article today in the Post.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Marion.  What about you guys?  I think what they're trying to say, your perm, it's a little tight.  It's not tight.  Tight.  Maybe it's got to loosen up.  It's got to loosen up a bit.  You got it done a couple weeks ago. 
[02:41:30]  By who?  Cousin Inn?  Who did it?  Who did it?  Lawn doctor?  Let me tell you one thing.  My hair looks better than your hair and your face and your butt put together.  No way.  I'm going to say butt because I know you're supposed to say that.  And I'm rubber and your face is smooth.  Oh, my God.  Hair by Chia Pet.  I'll tell you that.  You know what?  I don't even drink any water.  What?  I love you guys.  I drink water now. 
[02:42:00]  Hey, Marion, you had some drinks, you two.  Both of you did.  Both of you had some drinks.  What do you like from the train station?  Hey, Marion?  You can't even say train station.  I can't.  I saw a kind of a bank.  Hey, Marion?  What?  You lost the eight pounds.  I noticed you lost a little in the boob region.  Yeah.  That's why I lost a lot of it.  A PR back here.  How about a wow?  Not me.  Not me.  I don't wow.  Are you kidding?  Oh, my gosh.  Wow.  I'm married.  I don't wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Who's your husband?  Diane White. 
[02:42:30]  No.  You're married?  You're married?  I am married.  Who's your husband?  A blind donkey?  My husband's not a donkey.  Oh.  And if you met my husband, I'm sure he'd kick it right in your butt.  Like you're giving your hair to the guy.  No, this has been a pleasure.  Her shirt says Lady Di.  Doesn't her hair look like Oscar Gamble saw the burning bush?  I do something with mine.  See, I do something with my hair.  But you look like you're losing yours.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, man. 
[02:43:00]  She's on the boat.  Can you say something to him, then, if you don't want me to bust this guy?  You're an orgasm.  You go, nah.  That's me.  Oh, my gosh.  When you go like this, do you go, eh?  No.  Oh, wow.  The universal signs are lacking it.  Very good.  Hey, I'm giving it right back to him.  Oh, yeah.  You're doing great.  Call your hairdresser.  Tell him it's totaled.  Call your hairdresser.  Tell him you need a new hairdresser.  What's the deductible on that?  Let me tell you one thing.  I like my hair the way it is.  It was like this five years ago. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, my gosh.  Nobody has to live with it except for me.  And I like it.  Except for you and Sam Adams.  I don't drink.  We're over here.  Put a good eye on us.  I don't drink.  I don't drink.  Oh, my gosh.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Hey, Lady Di, what?  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Lady Di.  Yes.  What seems to be the problem over there?  There's nothing over here.  I'm just saying that I'm going to miss you guys.  You're a little distraught.  That's what you should do.  Lady Di.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, nice.  That was too much.  That's my nickname.  It's been for years.  Marion is my favorite character in Evercrest. 
[02:44:00]  She's got a lot of hit points.  You look like out-of-work field hockey players.  I'm not out-of-work.  You look like you're an out-of-work washed-up comedian.  No, I'm not.  You're a comedian who's trying to be an in-comedian.  I'm not an in-comedian.  But you're not an in-comedian.  I'm a B-minus.  You're not an in-comedian.  I'm not an in-comedian.  You're good.  Thank you.  I'm glad you like him.  I don't.  I don't like his impression.  Of what?  You don't have any impressions.  That's one.  Oh, no.  I know.  He's an idiot. 
[02:44:30]  You don't like his impression?  You're doing what?  You're doing an impression right now.  He's an idiot.  You're an asteroid.  You're an ass.  Holy ass.  I don't right now.  Are you Jeff Norris' mom?  No.  Oh, my God.  Jeff Norris' brother?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I'm going to come up with the quickest lines.  Okay.  Very good.  Frank, you know what I am.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, ladies, what do you think of the talented Monique over there?  Very nice. 
[02:45:00]  Hi.  How you doing?  Jesus Christ.  This is some show.  Oh, my God.  Someone will probably beat you up in high school.  Monique.  Let me tell you.  I can beat you.  Let me tell you.  Kids, I beat you up in high school because you look like you've been for a while.  Shut up, you stuttering hump.  It probably took you a week or two.  Whatever.  Who is that?  I know you've been such a boss.  I know, right?  Focus.  I keep forgetting him because I don't want to remember who you are because I don't want  to see you.  All right.  What about Jeffrey Ross? 
[02:45:30]  I think he'd be okay without him.  He's the king of the roast.  I like game one.  I like Andrew Dice Clay.  Wow.  That's who I like.  And he's your third.  Carrot Top?  No.  Howie Mandel?  No.  All right.  I like these ladies.  I feel bad now.  Why?  They're used to it.  Why?  Because I'm cool.  I'm cool and I take crap to nobody.  Thank you.  That's right, baby.  Uh-huh.  Give me a high five.  There you go.  All right.  Look at it.  They're sponsored by Greenpeace.  Okay. 
[02:46:00]  That's what happened the last time I was here, though.  But seriously.  Seriously.  What was it?  What was it?  What was it?  What was it?  How was my buddy?  Oh, when he was calling you a Martian?  Oh, my.  I just got my hair done.  She's not Martian no more.  Neither is she.  Who are you asking about?  Mark.  Psycho Mark.  What's he doing?  Hey, how's the cancer?  Did your uterus follow up yet, you dopey bitch?  Hey!  Hey!  You Martian.  You friggin' Martian mental case soap.  Hey!  Thank you!  You think you had a wife?  You just walked in there?  Thank you! 
[02:46:30]  You cancerous mental case.  I'm a mental case.  I know, thanks.  Die, die, die.  Get in a coffin.  Hi, you filthy whore!  I wish I could be down there to berate you in person.  Come back.  Come out.  Say hi.  I made you.  She's inviting people to your show.  Come on.  All right.  How did HBO miss this on the Bellevue special?  They're just taking the cameras right up here.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  All right, guys.  We've got to make a comment.  All right, guys.  I just wanted to say hi real fast.  It's probably my last time on AEW, but who cares?  All right.  What do you want your final words to be on this show?  What time do you want me to show up to work tomorrow?  All right, Mark.  All right.  Lady Di, I noticed you have a Lady Di shirt.  Yes, I have three of them.  Now, where did you get this?  And it's got the big L like Laverne used to wear.  A friend of mine.  Because you're the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I wanted to get one made up, but I said no.  Didn't you get that at Get a Life and Things? 
[02:47:30]  No, no, no.  That's a friend of mine.  All right.  I got in a fight with a hair crimper.  I bought your tape, by the way.  Doesn't Diane look like she's losing, too?  Doesn't she look like she's losing?  Sure.  Why not?  She's down the parachute.  I lost.  She lost a little bit.  All right.  Well, let Jeffrey Ross say something.  All right.  I bought your tape.  We are trying.  No, you don't have a tape, though, Jeffrey?  I bought your tape.  Carol's gone wild?  I don't look like a cow. 
[02:48:00]  You look like you need to lose, too.  Look at it.  Hey, I thought you liked Jeffrey Ross.  What happened?  Come on, Sybil.  Make up your mind.  I thought you liked him.  I could be more like the exorcist.  You can?  I bought your tape.  He can.  Hey, I bought your other tape.  I can make those exorcists.  I can make those exorcists noises.  Jeffrey, what other tape did you buy?  Blubbers, bloopers.  You haven't seen the exorcist.  I could probably.  I don't like these.  Look at that.  You make Rick Ross sound like Sir Anthony Hopkins. 
[02:48:30]  You haven't seen Psycho?  I could be a psycho.  Oh, Fincher.  She could be a psycho.  I could be a psycho.  Yeah?  All right.  Very good.  I guess you already know that.  Hey, all right.  All right.  Back under the bridge.  Make it look like an accident.  Back under the bridge.  Back under the bridge.  Ladies.  I know.  There they are.  Oh, my gosh.  Is White Castle closed today?  Always a pleasure.  Come off the same. 
[02:49:00]  Of course you did.  Back to White Castle.  I don't know if you know.  I don't eat White Castle.  I'm Mr. Fallon.  I don't like White Castle.  You smell like White Castle.  You smell like White Castle.  Do they make hair?  No.  You smell like you just clapped in your pants.  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, he's a friend.  Hey.  I don't like that.  He doesn't smell like White Castle.  I don't like White Castle.  No, he's a friend.  What's up with that?  I don't eat White Castle.  Did you hurt my feelings?  Oh, hey.  That's great.  Do you like White Castle?  I don't know.  The tall one doesn't seem as retarded as a little one. 
[02:49:30]  I don't like White Castle.  I'm a Penelope.  The next time you come here, I'll wear you a helmet.  You know what you'd be good for?  If they had like a...  Let me ask you something.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Does she look like Macy Gray after she looked in the Ark of the Covenant?  You're like Macy Gray's negative.  I don't know what Macy Gray is.  Oh, my gosh.  It's like Carmela Soprano.  Can I say something?  She looks like Paul Williams with breasts. 
[02:50:00]  Holy cow.  All right, time.  Paul Williams joke.  Wow.  Yo.  Paul Williams always looks like he had a bow on his head,  and his hair's not cut around a bow.  And it was after the accident.  But my hair don't look like I got a bow on top of my head.  You got a red shirt?  You're heading down to gay Disney?  No, I'm not going to gay Disney.  Just wondering.  Gay Marco called and said they wear red shirts.  I thought you had a thematic thing.  I want to wear.  Mary, can I ask you for a favor?  Sure.  One last wow. 
[02:50:30]  No.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  Wow, usually everyone cares.  What happened?  But your new body.  The new body.  Your new body.  The new body.  No, I said, I'll come up here in my bathing suit in July,  when I lose like 20 pounds by July.  It's the new Jan Brady.  My boyfriend's George Cat.  Well, you guys are going to be at Asbury Park, right?  That's what the woman's going around in Jersey.  Hey, start to marry for me.  One last time.  No.  I can go over and give you a hug.  No, no, no. 
[02:51:00]  I won't do that.  The hug thing just doesn't work anymore.  You are not.  No, that's okay.  That's okay.  We'll be back.  Don't worry.  You know where?  Where?  Over here?  Over here?  Can I ask you guys something?  Like, tomorrow or Monday, do we have to flip around the dials  and find out where you guys are or what?  We'll call you at the Port Authority.  We don't hang at the Port Authority.  No, you live there.  You live in the Port Authority.  All right, listen.  Hey, Rich, Rich.  What's that?  That would be Mr. Valls.  Do you own your own home?  No.  Well, I do. 
[02:51:30]  Okay.  That's good.  Congratulations.  And how far is it up to trees?  Looks like you did a hair with a waffle on here.  At least I make enough money that I have my own home.  All right, listen.  It's a trick for everybody.  Well, all right, ladies.  What do you do?  None of your business.  Oh.  Look at this.  Marion.  None of your business.  Marion, one last while.  Quick.  Please.  No.  At least the buns.  No.  We see the buns.  No.  The buns.  No way.  All right, Marion.  I won't do it either.  You did it before. 
[02:52:00]  Well, no.  Marion.  Mary Kay called.  They're going to give you their money back.  No.  I don't wear Mary Kay products.  I do.  I do.  You're kind of normal.  The tall one's kind of normal, though.  Thank you very much.  No, he keeps saying I'm normal, so I'm going to leave it that way.  You keep going.  Lady Di, do you cut your own bangs, though?  What's up with that?  No, no, no, no, no.  I had my hair done a few weeks ago, and it's growing out right now.  Yeah, it looks like you cut your own bangs.  Rams, Romans, and countrymen.  Exactly.  You got the alfalfa swipes or bangs.  All right, listen.  She looks like Friar Tuck. 
[02:52:30]  We haven't listened to the show.  All right, listen.  I'm getting a headache.  Calm down, ladies.  Just back up.  Monique's ready to perform.  All right?  We'll get to you in a minute.  All right.  All right.  Ladies, yeah.  Just step aside a little bit.  Let the...  Monique is now going to perform.  We've had quite enough of this.  Monique, what do you think of the retarded Laverne and Shirley?  I love them.  I love them.  Yeah, baby.  So wonderful.  How are you feeling?  I'm feeling very nice.  Nice.  Yeah, that room took over. 
[02:53:00]  There they go.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley going back out outside into the lobby area.  All right.  That's good.  No, they can just sit in the corner.  All right.  If you want to go in the corner, you can go in the corner.  It doesn't matter.  Back to the bridge.  You see them walk out with their little pocketbooks?  Oh, my gosh.  Are they the funniest?  I love those two.  Funniest retarded people you've ever seen in your life.  I love them.  They should really do some sort of retarded sitcom.  Well, I would watch that every day.  Real.  So much love.  They have them.  You are in the retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[02:53:30]  They can do a Broadway play, Two Abbots, No Costello.  You just see the yellow bus drive by in the intros while they're rolling the credits,  and you see them with their hockey helmets on, drooling on the windows.  I'd tune in every week.  Oh, we forgot to play their theme song.  Sorry.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  We're signing.  We're ugly.  We won't shut up.  Then we're going on the 80s.  We're so annoying.  No one can take it.  When we look in the mirror to break it.  We'll give you nightmares. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, people.  Like a couple of needles.  We're not enough.  We're not enough.  We're not enough.  We're not enough.  We're not enough.  We're not enough.  I got sort of a kind of a brain. 
[02:54:30]  So bad.  Y'all don't stop it.  Earl, you ready for your lap dance?  After that, yes, I am.  Yeah.  All right.  We were fighting off.  I was fighting off the urge from turning into stone.  Are you guys going out tonight, Monique and Earl?  I am.  Except to him.  Earl.  Man, look at him.  See how much room. 
[02:55:00]  Let's see how he feels after a lap dance, though.  That's what I'm thinking.  Retired dancer.  Used to dance at Knockers.  I'm your private dancer.  Dancer for Earl.  Earl, why don't you sit down on the lesbian couch.  Take a seat.  We have a field mic.  Should I invite him to Joe's Pub?  Yeah, Joe's Pub with Jeffrey Ross tomorrow night.  Of course.  With Ross at Stress Factory tonight.  Yeah.  He can't take the N.E.W. van all the way down there. 
[02:55:30]  Ready?  All right.  There we go.  I've got to get a position up here.  Oh, my God.  Look at her getting in the mood, man.  Nice.  Holy ash.  She's fucking on her thumb.  Oh, yeah.  Motley Crue.  Nice.  Little Motley Crue playing.  And here we go.  Earl on the lesbian couch.  For real.  Monique.  Sam, we'll find Earl attractive.  I thought she was, I sort of recognized the lingo and the speech pattern before.  Yeah.  I didn't want to say anything, though. 
[02:56:00]  You're a hip to that lingo.  Yes, I am.  Soul.  Yeah.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  Earl has no effing idea what to do.  Earl's just sitting.  Earl's gotten lap dances before.  Okay.  Earl, smile.  No, they don't like that.  That scares them.  Oh, it doesn't?  Yeah.  Well, Earl now on the couch seems to be sporting the high-hard one.  Thank you, Bob Murphy.  All right.  Monique has taken off one shoe so far. 
[02:56:30]  She is hetero for a day on the lesbian couch that Earl's done.  Have you seen this?  Available at richvoss.com.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  The pants are coming down.  Yeah, babe.  The pants are coming down.  Here we go.  She's got her arms around Earl's neck.  Now she's whispering something in her ear and kissing his head.  Oh, yeah.  That's the move.  A little straddling action.  Nice. 
[02:57:00]  He's about ready to see the pool rack filled with afro hair.  All right.  She's got red panties sticking out of her pants.  Give Earl the mic for a second.  Earl, what do you think, man?  I'm having a good time.  Yeah.  That's it.  Hey, Earl's bald head has hair on it now.  Yeah, it threw a hair heel straight.  Looks like Mr. T.  Wow, she's pretty good at that dancing.  Oh, Earl, what do you think? 
[02:57:30]  Something tells me.  Earl, now imagine her doing that.  You're both completely naked.  Oh.  It could happen.  Last time I did that, I was 15.  This laptop is sponsored by McCarty.  Crazy.  Wow.  She's grinding.  Now her legs over Earl's shoulders as she's grinding away.  She's done this before.  Yeah, something tells me.  Monique.  Yes.  Is there anything going on?  You know what I mean.  Is there anything going on?  Damn, honique. 
[02:58:00]  Nice.  Yeah, I feel like I'm at bada bing.  Stinky, what's wrong?  Stinky.  I'm embarrassed to watch Earl go through this.  Why?  Earl's really into it now.  It's nice.  Monique, can you take your pants off?  No answer.  She doesn't hear us anymore, Anthony.  Yeah, now she's...  Earl, she said you could take her pants off.  Take her pants off, Earl.  Take her pants off.  Oh, she dressed for the occasion. 
[02:58:30]  She would know what.  Wow.  Nice.  There they go.  Wow.  Her pants are off.  Here they go.  Earl's taking her pants off.  What's she got on there?  Shut the lock.  Chocolat.  Yeah.  Holy mess.  She is...  Well, how do you describe that?  Now she's...  Well, she's using her hand.  That's all I can say.  Still smells like jam on.  Earl, what do you think?  This rocks.  Yeah.  Hey, guys. 
[02:59:00]  Thanks.  Whoa.  She's got her legs in the air.  Whoa, look at that.  What do you think?  Yeah?  It does look like a wallet.  Wow.  She really knows how to work it, Anthony.  Oh, she's totally going at it.  Earl, nice, huh?  Stop that.  Earl, what are you talking about?  Stop that.  I hope there's nothing going on down there.  Sam, get a better look.  You don't get to see this.  It's not too often.  What are you hiding in the back? 
[02:59:30]  Earl, you should be using your hands, some of them like that.  Stop being scared.  You could, you could, you know...  It ain't in a real club.  Feel around.  It ain't a real club.  It ain't a real club.  It ain't no sit-out.  Just make sure nothing's down there from, you know, every so often.  Earl, she invited you to, you know...  Earl.  Venture into the forbidden zone. 
[03:00:00]  Damn you!  She's just grinding away in her little red panty.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Wow, she is really getting into it, too.  Earl, nice.  I got glitter all over me.  Oh, you got body glitter on you?  The universal tag of the female.  You do have glitter all over you.  Are her pubes pink and yellow also?  I didn't know I had glitter all over me.  Wow.  They got some body glitter.  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Uh-oh.  I thought she was reaching for the panties, Opie.  She's lipped.  Oh, Earl.  Wow, nice.  Holy cow, Earl made the move.  Earl made the move.  He's a hand right on ass.  You see the looky gamer?  Yeah, Earl, just grab that ass.  Yes.  Yeah, Earl.  Yeah.  You've got to grab that ass.  Earl, yeah.  Nice.  And I need that look.  There's some.  Any minute I expect to see her fly through the ceiling.  A lap dance like this in a club would cost around $300. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  You don't get something like this in a club.  Hey, Monique.  Yeah.  You're kind of in that position there.  Is there anything going on?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Give it three more seconds.  All you're going to hear is...  What did Jeffy Ross say?  Is the remote here?  Huh?  Is the remote?  He's looking at the couch for the lost remote.  Or maybe some loose change. 
[03:01:30]  There you have it.  That is a great lap dance, Earl.  Yeah.  And Earl, unlike a club, you could actually go out with this girl, man.  You could touch me.  Oh, my God.  Earl, she wants you to touch her.  Earl might break that six-hour record that she's got.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Good girl.  Yeah, Earl.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Earl.  Earl, what the heck?  Nice.  I thought black men didn't do that. 
[03:02:00]  I'm big dick.  Oh, my gosh.  Rich Moss said the black man don't do that.  I'm big dick.  Rich in a lap dance is a clap dance.  Earl, what do you call that move?  Mine.  It's the Earl.  It's the Earl.  Now I'll be having fun.  Oh, man.  That was some WCW stuff.  Wow, Earl.  Now I'll be having fun.  Earl, I guess we could say he went for a taste.  Yeah, a little bit.  He got right in there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Fank that ass, Earl.  Fank that ass.  There you go.  Nice.  Wow.  Earl's playing Massa.  Wow.  She's got that butt.  Oh, my God.  She's got that butt, man.  This must have been just what it looked like at Jesse Jackson headquarters years back.  Earl is looking right into the balloon knot.  Stay out the bushes.  Monique's head is on the ground. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Apusa.  And Earl's still on the couch.  Monique, you like that?  Yeah.  Oh.  That is my favorite.  Oh, you like that.  I'm getting my ass slaps.  Oh, yeah.  And Earl's doing a good job.  Right now, Earl's taking out all the aggressions of three years on her ass.  She's in cowgirl position right now.  Yeah.  And with her finger.  Look at her finger.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  That's good.  There you go, Earl.  That's nice.  Yeah, Earl.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Earl.  Earl's petting the poodle.  Don't just stare at it.  Earl.  Earl's popping it.  Can't see.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Earl.  Work in the north side.  There we go.  Oh, my gosh.  Wow.  Earl, you take this with you when you go.  Put the song on again.  Okay, can we get you at the towel?  Yeah, right. 
[03:04:00]  We've already got a hose off.  We've played the song four times already.  Mom.  Mom.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Look at that.  Earl's like it.  Look at the smile on his face.  When do you see this?  He's laughing.  He's happy y'all made some progress.  Yeah.  You made some major progress today, Monique.  Right now, Earl's at a stick her stop.  Nice.  Wow. 
[03:04:30]  Did you hear that?  Oops.  This should be a WB show.  Earl's liking the back.  Oh, we should.  It's so good.  It's so good to see Earl having a great time.  I doubt it, Jeffrey.  He's miserable all the time.  And this is like...  He's not miserable all the time.  Well, now you're not.  Oh, look at that.  Uh-oh.  Insert tongue.  Wow.  What do you want on this couch? 
[03:05:00]  Nice.  What do you want in this couch?  Yeah.  That ass is smoother than your head, Earl, right?  Yeah.  Hey, Monique.  You're loving that, aren't you?  Yeah.  You can't get enough.  Wow.  Bring back a whole lot of memories.  Yeah, you got...  It's all time.  What's that?  What's up?  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Monique, you all right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's fine.  All right.  All right.  You're changing positions.  Opie, don't be silly.  All right.  Anything else you want to do to Earl?  A whole lot. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  The guy's in.  He's in.  She's, like, naked and stuff now.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Why did I ask all that questions?  Yeah, Earl.  What's up?  What do they want to do?  Earl, what do you want to do?  What do you want to do, man?  I'm just fine right where I am.  You name it.  You want to get a room or something?  Go to Park Central.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Okay. 
[03:06:00]  Holy ass.  Yeah, I know.  This is just something.  I am stupid-fied.  All right.  You want to, um...  What?  You want to get him a room or something?  What?  Yeah, we can do that.  You want to get him a room?  We'll get you guys a room if you want.  And then if we return to these airwaves, you'll find out what happened.  You guys better.  Better return.  She's getting all worked.  She's so worked up right now.  Two TV stolen.  Oh, man. 
[03:06:30]  Here it goes.  That ass is moving in, like, five different directions.  Huh?  What's the world to know, man?  Oh, the webcam's broken.  Yeah, the stinky cam's not working.  Stupid webcam.  Well, don't worry.  We're rolling video for foundrymusic.com.  Yes.  All right.  And we've got to go.  Yeah, I know.  Look at the time.  You guys continue over there.  I want to thank Monique for coming down and waking Earl.  That was fun.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  Jeffrey Ross, of course. 
[03:07:00]  Hoping.  Well, yeah.  If all goes well and Earl actually closes the deal, when he finishes, it's the first time  he'll ever have worn white.  Right?  We can't call him Black Earl anymore.  Earl can't even talk right now.  It's going to look like an explosion to Elmo's glue factory.  Please.  I am an aspiring singer, actress, dancer.  Well, this is the way to do it.  Well, that just ended, Danny.  His name is Nauru, and I perform every Wednesday at Nyorican Poets Cafe, which is on 3rd Street 
[03:07:30]  in the East Village, between Avenue B and C. Please come and check me out.  Girl's touching you between Avenue B and C right now.  I was so moving when she said that.  It's like she had practice.  Yeah.  Didn't miss a beat.  I thought that, but...  This is your last show.  Congratulations on a great run at N.E.W.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jeffrey Ross.  Thanks for the many times you let me come on, and it was good knowing you guys.  Good luck. 
[03:08:00]  Jeffrey, where are you going to be?  Tomorrow night at Joe's Pub at 8.30.  That's much more important than our little lives.  No, we're not going to, like, you know...  I don't know.  We have no clue what's going to happen.  This, quite possibly, we don't know, could be the last show we do on WNAW.  We're not going to know.  If we knew for sure, this would have been the F.U. show, trust me.  Yeah, we really don't know.  You guys will be speaking Spanish next week.  Regardless of what happens, we will be in New York. 
[03:08:30]  We're based in New York.  It's just a matter of where we'll be.  And how long we'll be off the air until we're able to be back on the air in New York.  But it could turn out that we're here.  I don't know.  But officially, our contract ended a minute ago.  That's it.  Wow, we're flying without a net.  That's right.  Rich Voss.  I still better have my goddamn benefit.  Rich Voss at the Stress Factory tonight.  Rich Voss.com for his new CD.  Thanks, you guys.  With his old bit.  Seven tracks, really putting it out there. 
[03:09:00]  It's a good CD.  It's a good CD.  It's a good CD.  There you go.  From Jeffrey Ross.  All right.  All that themselves.  And let's get out of here, all right?  Let's get out of here, man.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Well, we have to do our live read, so...  Oh, well, we'll almost be out of here.  Hold on.  Opie and Anthony.  What other radio show is going to give you, like, intelligent talk about stocks and girls  playing What's In My Pair?  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
