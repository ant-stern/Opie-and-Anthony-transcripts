<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of a woman capable of projectile vomiting, followed by a quick greeting from Louis Black of *The Daily Show*.  The hosts then played Metallica and Creed, prompting listener complaints about their musical selections.  They shifted to celebrating the success of their unofficial website, approaching one million hits, featuring user-submitted photos (requiring O&A-related verification) and a video showcasing a past awkward crocodile encounter.  A “Girls of the Opie and Anthony Show” segment, using listener-submitted photos, was also highlighted. Rick's upcoming London trip and the return of a segment featuring a previously featured naked woman were mentioned.

The show moved to listener calls.  One caller detailed his snowy driving experiences, prompting a discussion of Opie's past car problems. Another caller humorously blamed Opie for his flu, leading to a conversation about their relative immunity to illness. Opie attributed his resistance to constant germ exposure from Anthony and the morning show host. Opie bragged about his behind-the-scenes efforts promoting the show in Boston, including his successful schmoozing with WBCN management and the resulting benefits, much to Anthony's irritation.  A further call recounted a terrifying engine failure at high speed. The segment concluded with the hosts repeatedly shouting "I'm going to take it."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck radio.  Stand over.  This is sicker than faces of death.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony Afternoons.  Mason and Kaliski Mornings.  The Radio Check Middays.  On 1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from her private area. 
[00:00:30]  Hi, this is Louis Black from The Daily Show.  And you're listening to two of the most psychotic human beings I've ever met.  My pals Opie and Anthony on 102.7 WNEW.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're off to a flying start today.  If you want something, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Our fax line is working.  If you're working yourself today on this miserable Monday afternoon.  Fax line 212-957-9639.  Want to get everyone in a good mood, a rocking mood.  So we're going to take a quick musical break. 
[00:01:00]  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  In the meantime, it's Metallica.  Old school.  Master of puppets.  Crank it up.  It's 1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Quick music break there.  Yeah.  Creed, my own president.  Metallica before that.  Master of puppets.  Bunch of people bitching and complaining.  They don't like...  We can't win with Metallica. 
[00:01:30]  They don't like the old Metallica.  They want the new Metallica.  You play the new Metallica, they want the old Metallica.  You can't win.  Can't win.  I guess eventually we're just going to have to stop playing music altogether.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Hmm.  Look at that.  Steve C. from the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Yeah.  He just checked in through the instant feedback.  A couple of very interesting things happening with the unofficial website.  First of all, the damn thing is going to reach a million hits this week. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, we have to have a party.  We should have a party.  It's right.  Yeah.  A million hits on an unofficial website.  It was a little dream of Ant and I, you know, just to have a fan site that would just take off  and a little outlet for some of the stuff we do here, get some pictures up so it's not just you  listening to us with, you know, nudies in here.  Right.  We get to see what they look like.  We like sharing with our audience.  Of course.  And it was open to everyone and Steve C. came through and his site by far is the best one we've seen thus far without a doubt. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And at this point, Steve's being really cool because a lot of other listeners are starting O&A fan sites  and Steve's linking it to the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  So that's pretty cool.  But it's going to reach a million hits this week, which is unbelievable because it only started in June.  Yeah.  Like what?  A little over seven months, a million hits.  It's not too shabby considering we really haven't been able to give it out over the air.  It's truly on the ground because most of the time we're not allowed to say foundrymusic.com, Anthony.  So that's happening. 
[00:03:00]  Also, he's going to be brave enough to put the rock confrontation on the underground website.  Yeah, video, not just audio.  Video because Steve was in the studio the day we had the big confrontation with the croc.  He videotaped the whole thing.  It is really awkward.  Once again, putting us out there for all you to say.  That's right.  We definitely don't look good in that video.  And then he started a new segment on the unofficial website called The Girls of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I guess girls email in their pictures.  Right.  To Steve.  Correct.  And he posts them.  Right.  But it can't just be like if you're some guy and you've been cruising the websites and you find naked girls,  you can't send it in and say, hi, my name's, you know, Sue, and this is me.  Because they have to have some kind of O&A reference to it or, you know, there's got to be some kind of proof that it's you. 
[00:04:00]  And what do we got here now?  We got Tammy.  Tammy and Maya from Massachusetts.  We got Tammy.  Tammy's got a pretty hot bond on her.  Now, you know, I'm going to have to be honest, though.  What Steve is looking for are true listeners of the Opie and Anthony Show.  So when the women do send the, you know, the shots of themselves into Steve's unofficial website,  they've got to prove they're a listener of the show by either holding up a WNEW or something that says Opie and Anthony  so we can prove that you guys didn't just surf the Internet like you just said, Ed. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  And send in a really hot girl.  Now, Maya obviously isn't a fan of our show, but I guess he's got to get this going somehow.  Yeah.  Because she's from Los Angeles and we're not syndicated to L.A. yet.  Yeah.  But Tammy, she's 20 years old from Massachusetts.  Yeah, we're a fan from Massachusetts.  We still have a ton of faithful listeners in the Boston area.  Matter of fact, WBCN up there is starting to play our bits, which is kind of nice.  And Tammy has sent in pictures of herself in lingerie for the unofficial website for the girls of the O&A show. 
[00:05:00]  Rock.  Very, very cool section of the unofficial website.  Looking forward to seeing other women sending in their pictures to Steve's unofficial website.  Ew.  And I think when Rick gets back from vacation, because Rick is heading off to London, I believe, today or tomorrow.  What's Rick doing in London?  Ah, he's going home.  Vacationing?  He's going with his wife and stuff.  Yeah.  Cute little.  Let's go overseas for four or five days. 
[00:05:30]  Didn't they just take a honeymoon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get them and get it all in now.  There you go.  We're going to bring back the hottest girl to ever pose naked on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah, bring that feature back.  But there you go.  So if you do check out the unofficial website any time this week, definitely congratulate Steve on reaching a million hits.  We never thought it was possible.  Yeah.  And the damn guy, he's put in many, many, many, many hours on this website.  And we're pretty proud to say that it's pretty cool. 
[00:06:00]  Hell yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  The phone's going nuts, Anthony.  We haven't gotten to the phones in, wow, about an hour already.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll go right to the phones if you have something for the show.  Lots to get to today still.  Our phone number is 212-757-1027.  The fax line, 212-957-9639.  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony.  You're not a chat cast.  You're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick. 
[00:06:30]  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony Afternoons.  Mason and Kalinske mornings.  The Radio Chick Middays.  On 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  On this dreary Monday afternoon.  Yeah, kind of miserable out.  Oh.  Nah.  It's all right, though.  Rainy.  I mean, Mondays suck in general.  And then to have this rain like this.  Yeah.  I guess it could be worse. 
[00:07:00]  It could be snow.  I don't know.  I'm kind of wanting a little bit of snow.  You want some snow?  Well, you want a little bit, don't you?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Honestly, I don't.  No?  That's a sign of age.  The older you get, you just don't want to deal with the snow.  Remember when you were young?  Yeah.  You wish it would snow like four or five feet at a time?  I don't care, though.  I want a little bit of snow this year.  Just something so I could drop my truck in it.  So you could feel good that global warming isn't taking over? 
[00:07:30]  No, I don't care about that.  Just come on.  Get an SUV.  You want to kick the four-wheel drive in.  How funny is that?  When you had your other car, oh, my God, I had a Cougar.  Yeah.  Oh, the thing would slip and slide if the temperature was like 35 degrees.  It didn't even have to be frozen out.  When we moved to Massachusetts to do radio for a few years, and we're not from Boston.  We're from here.  I don't know how many times we have to say it, but we're up there for three years.  Yeah, and had the Cougar.  Yeah.  And it snowed like a mother up there. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, crazy.  And I had the SUV just tooling around, and it's like, oh, I can barely get out of parking  spot.  And I used to have to pull into parking spaces that weren't slightly dipped toward the back  because I would never get out.  Yeah.  I swear the slightest little incline, the wheels would just be spinning.  Oh, here's me by the house.  Yeah.  I can't get out.  I can't get out.  How many times did you call me to try to work?  I know.  We had the worst winters up there. 
[00:08:30]  And then Springhead, and then you got me.  Because then you're tooling down the highway like going 100 in that damn car.  That's great.  It's like, oh, yeah, we're going up to New Hampshire or something.  I'll be up there in 15 minutes.  Yeah.  And I'll see you in two hours.  So now you trade that in, you get the SUV finally, and you're not even going to be able  to play around in the snow.  I know.  I was pissed at the Cougar.  The speedometer went up to 140.  But there's some kind of governor that kicks in at 120 and shuts it.  I swear to God, you couldn't go any faster.  I was like, oh, I was pissed.  I wanted to get up to 140. 
[00:09:00]  Just to see what it feels like.  Yeah.  Why not?  Dave, what's going on, buddy?  Dave, what's going on?  All right.  Dave?  Sorry, guys.  I didn't even know what was on.  Yeah, let's go.  I was just saying the same thing Anthony said.  I was so pissed, man, after that blizzard we had.  I went out and bought a four-wheel drive SUV.  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to kick ass through the snow this year.  Two years, it hasn't snowed.  What the hell happened?  Nothing.  What happened?  I don't know. 
[00:09:30]  And there's no snow in the near future either.  No snow.  And I'm looking for it all the time just to kick in that four-wheel drive once.  Yeah.  Just once.  Yeah, I'm sure we'll get a little bit.  But, you know, we always get jacked somewhere.  Maybe April.  You know, you get those April blizzards.  That's what happens.  Then by April, you don't want it to snow.  Now you just want spring to head.  And all of a sudden, you get like 18 inches of snow.  Gee, thanks.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You know, we want the nice weather to come.  So we got the Whippemount Wednesday coming back. 
[00:10:00]  Let me tell you something.  What are we up to, January 10th?  Yeah.  February.  God, we are less than three months away before we pop Whippemount Wednesday again.  Yeah.  And another thing, I got the sign of my SUV.  You know, the same thing.  Right.  There's nothing happening there, boy.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  All right, bye.  Take it easy, guys.  Joseph, you're next.  What's going on?  I got a bone to pick with you.  Why?  I hope.  Why?  You're responsible for the outbreak.  The flu outbreak?  Oh, my God. 
[00:10:30]  Why am I responsible?  Because you know what?  You're the first one that was talking about being sick.  Now, the entire world has it.  You know, ask Ant.  I am so paranoid about this, too, because, I mean, you know.  You did it.  You breathe on my back, and I get sick.  I know.  I'm the worst.  I mean, I swear I got a routine.  I'm like the bubble boy at home.  You know, I refuse to go out.  I take the train, and as soon as I come in, I scrub down with all these antibacterial soaps and stuff.  Yeah.  I just don't want to get sick. 
[00:11:00]  Dude, I got to tell you, I'm sitting here.  I'm on the computer, the porn sites.  Just nobody's home.  It's terrible.  Why?  I'm typing with one hand.  Why aren't you working today?  You're sick?  Oh.  Yeah?  I'm so sick.  Yeah.  You wouldn't believe.  Oh.  I'm lying, and it's your fault.  But you have time to, you know, surface some porn.  Well, it's the only time my wife's not hoping.  You got to keep yourself entertained.  You know, the day's longer.  There you go.  You don't do it.  No, I, you know, for the first time in a while this weekend, I noticed that it's starting 
[00:11:30]  to get lighter.  Well, I got to tell you something.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I want to sue you.  All right.  Well, I hope you get better.  Well, thank you very much.  All right, bye.  I think I was the first person in New York to get this stupid flu, though.  It's a monster of a flu, too.  I got a note here.  Yeah.  It was sitting here at my, where I sit in the studio.  Anthony, Mason is sick again, so I had to spray the mic.  You'll know immediately it isn't perfume. 
[00:12:00]  Sorry, chick.  Mason's sick again?  I don't understand why you don't get sick, eh?  Well, I'll knock wood before I say anything.  When was the last time you were sick?  Do you even remember?  It was on the air.  Remember?  I took a day off, and I think it was...  Had to be over a year ago.  Oh, yeah, definitely over a year ago.  It was when we first started here.  Right.  And you're sharing the mic with the morning guy.  I think I was constantly sick and has his snot and blood tissues all over your area, and  you're not getting sick.  Maybe it's, I've built up like a super immune system because of that. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  You know, the stuff's right in my face all the time.  And I scrub down with the bacterial soap.  I don't touch anyone, and I get sick.  You're not allowing your body to build up the immunities.  That's what it is.  I eat well.  I don't eat junk.  I eat well.  You know, and then I drink a few beers.  You got to do that, oh?  I've been drinking lately.  Oh, good.  I'm glad to hear it.  There'd you have booze and up some tequila shots up in Boston this weekend. 
[00:13:00]  Are you crazy?  Well, as you know by now, Ann, I'm wheeling and dealing for the show.  Thank God.  I got, you know, important meetings in Boston.  Thank God someone is.  They're playing our bits now in Boston.  I'm making sure everything's okay, so I'm running up there.  I guess the second.  Schmoozing with the bosses up there.  We have another set of bosses we have to deal with now.  Well, see, I don't quite see it that way.  Because they're not paying us.  Yeah, I'll get involved when some money starts floating this way. 
[00:13:30]  See, what you got to do is take a road trip to Boston because know what's happening?  Yeah.  I am reaping all the benefits and you're not because I go up there and I'm wheeling and  dealing.  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to send more of our bits so you guys can play it on the air and  stuff.  We're like an artist up there.  We're like a band because what they're doing is they're like playing like the OJ911 phone  call, let's say.  Okay?  Wow.  And they're playing it like it's a song.  So we're like an artist.  We're getting spins on WBCN in Boston. 
[00:14:00]  They just play us throughout the whole day.  We are like an artist.  We're getting screwed.  We're not seeing any money for our labors.  So what I want to tell you, though, is we are truly like an artist.  You definitely got to take a road trip up there because I'm reaping the benefits because  I wheel and deal.  I give them the new bits and stuff.  And, you know, I find out what's going on with our bits and how they're being perceived  up there.  And what do you get out of it?  Then I go out to the, you know, for a nice dinner.  Oh, see?  You're at least getting something out of it.  Don't have to pay for anything.  Wow.  Damn you.  Slamming down the tequila.  Yeah, what's up with that? 
[00:14:30]  I can never, ever get you to do shots.  Ever.  It's the new O.  New millennium.  The new O.  New millennium.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  The new O.  Tequila, though.  That stuff will kick your ass, man.  You know what the problem is with tequila?  I don't care.  You know, we're picking out a tequila this weekend, right?  Yeah.  It's like, you know, the Cuervo is like the basic cheap stuff.  And one of the bosses is like, no, no, we want your best tequila, right? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  And I just hate tequila in general.  And it still tastes like crap.  Really?  Yeah.  See, because the Sammy Hagar tequila is good.  That wasn't bad.  I got it, man.  I like that stuff.  What the hell was it called again?  The Cabo Wabo tequila?  Yeah.  Something like that.  That wasn't bad.  Mm-hmm.  But the stuff I had, I mean, it was real expensive stuff.  And I was still like, this is just as bad as Cuervo, man.  The salt and the lemon and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  How many would you say you'd done?  Honestly, just a couple. 
[00:15:30]  A couple?  Yeah.  And just a few margaritas.  I mean, that was lit.  Tequila night?  That was lit.  They got some plans for us in Boston, Anthony.  Do they?  They don't want to bore our New York audience, but it's kind of exciting for our New York audience,  too, because a lot of you guys are part of the bits we've sent up there.  So now a couple of you guys have been heard in Boston as well.  So you're part of our little syndication game we're playing here.  I'm sure they'll all want cash for it, too.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I guess the next time I go up there, I've got to start talking money.  I just feel bad.  Hi, I'm the stupidest man on the face of the earth. 
[00:16:00]  Remember me?  I called for that landscaping job.  Well, I'm not that stupid.  I really want some cash.  Oh, we haven't played that bit in a while.  No, we had a dreadsling one.  What we should do is call Boston maybe sometime this week to see how our bits are doing.  We'll call the radio station that is playing our stuff.  See how we're received.  See how we're received.  All right.  Why not?  Be into doing that.  All right.  Ah, phones are nuts.  And, ah, shoot.  We'll take one more call before we take another break.  Tommy, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  All right. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, check it out, man.  I went out.  I thought this was going to be an Aurora, right?  Yeah.  The North Star engine, okay?  The magazine that I read, you know, I read all the reviews, set the car to 154 miles an  hour, compared it to the Caddy's the whole bit.  I'm headed down to Atlantic City one night.  It's late.  I got a call with a people.  I'm flying down.  Road's empty, right?  So I'm like, I'm going to open this bad boy up.  Hit 100.  Nice.  Nice and smooth.  No problem.  Yeah.  Hit 110.  No problem.  Going great.  We'll laugh.  We'll have a good time.  Got the radio up.  I hit 112. 
[00:17:00]  I thought I hit a brick wall, man.  The frigging thing died on me.  Yeah, the engine just goes boom.  Boom.  Like, what the hell?  I was pissed.  I was pissed.  I know exactly how you feel.  It's like riding all smooth.  You know you could go another 20 miles an hour faster without the thing rattling apart  or anything.  And then the governor just kicks in and the engine goes boom.  Boom.  Dead, man.  It shuts down.  It's $36,000.  I thought I pulled a few of that.  I'm looking for the governor.  Yeah, there's got to be something on it.  You cannot find it. 
[00:17:30]  Anyway, guys, love the show.  I've got to run.  I'm working.  All right.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to take it. </pre>
