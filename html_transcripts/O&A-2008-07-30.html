<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts jokingly referencing their infamous reputation as "radio shock jocks," before discussing Opie's recent traffic stop, where he received only a warning, which they attribute to his race and the type of car he was driving.  This leads to a discussion of a news story involving police brutality and the appropriate level of citizen compliance during an arrest.  A caller, Jerry, then demands an apology to Black Americans for historical injustices, sparking a debate about reparations and Obama's stance on the issue.

The show shifts to a discussion of their absence from radio stations in Syracuse ("Shut Up and Rock" replaced them) and Philadelphia, criticizing the replacement programming given the easy availability of music via streaming services. Anthony's unsuccessful attempt to quickly locate a Guns N' Roses song on his iPhone humorously underscores this point.

Comedian Rich Voss joins the show in studio. The conversation turns to the video game "Fat Princess" and the feminist backlash against its premise, which involves fattening the princess by feeding her cake.  This triggers a debate about feminism, obesity, personal responsibility, and societal influences on eating habits.  A lawyer caller, who is also overweight, discusses lawsuits against airlines filed by overweight passengers.  The discussion, involving multiple callers, including a trucker (Scott) and Erin, explores the impact of childhood habits and metabolism on weight.  The hosts, along with Voss, engage in vulgar jokes about overweight individuals.  Callers largely agree with or add to the hosts' opinions, with some truckers challenging Scott's claims about lack of time for exercise. The hosts also make offensive jokes about stereotypical school figures.

The show briefly touches on unrelated news items, including the birthdays of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Paul Anka, the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, Brett Favre's NFL reinstatement, and their upcoming live show with Rich Voss.  Sonny, a caller, shares his weight loss struggles, further fueling the discussion on metabolism and diet. Opie details his disciplined approach to food and exercise. The show then discusses an "Extreme Home Makeover" house that went into foreclosure, leading to a discussion about personal responsibility, the show's sponsors, and the hosts' own financial habits and childhood experiences with money.  They end the segment with apologies for earlier arguments.

A significant portion of the show features Rich Voss struggling with basic math regarding his mortgage and displaying limited knowledge of American history, leading to comedic exchanges and the creation of the internet forum name suggestion "I'm 5.3 quarters."  A caller criticizes Voss's lack of knowledge about money and World War II.  The show then discusses Jerry Lewis's airport incident involving an unloaded gun and other celebrities facing similar issues. The hosts then criticize the Today Show's rock band segment, deeming it self-consciously "awful." A news story about a necrophiliac morgue employee sparks more comedic banter. The hosts discuss a "Whip Them Out Wednesday" promotion and Matt Lauer's reaction, before the arrival of Mel Karmazin is anticipated, with the hosts urging Voss to leave. The upcoming Sirius and XM merger is discussed extensively.

The show features a lengthy interview with Mel Karmazin, CEO of Sirius XM Radio, focusing on the merger, FCC regulations, financial aspects, and the integration of programming.  Karmazin discusses potential job losses, subscriber impact, and his previous tense meeting with Opie and Anthony six years prior, recalling his opening line: “What time do you wake up in the morning and decide you're going to fuck Mel Karmazin?”  The hosts recount their perspective on the situation with Howard Stern and Karmazin explains the rationale behind their contract decisions. The conversation is interspersed with humorous asides, vulgar language, and a suggestive interaction with a female caller. References are made to other radio personalities like Howard Stern, Bubba the Love Sponge, Ron and Fez, and Scott Shannon.

The show concludes with a discussion about a potential move from morning to afternoon drive time, fueled by listener calls and internal SiriusXM dynamics.  There’s banter about headwear, a caller congratulates them on their improved financial situation.  The discussion shifts to their contract and slot preferences, and Rich's need for a lawyer to deal with a storage unit, leading to ethnic stereotypes. They discuss Jim Brewer's potential return to their comedy show.  A highly sexually charged conversation ensues with a female caller, Megan, in studio. The segment ends with a "line of the day" competition and further sexually suggestive commentary. They discuss Karmazin's visit, workplace dynamics, and the upcoming election, before ending with improv exercises with a caller.

[00:00:00]  it's the Opie and Anthony show. Opie and Anthony. Radio shock jocks. Opie and Anthony. We have to be nice and make people feel good. Go screw. Radio bad boys. Opie and Anthony. Controversial radio personalities. Opie and Anthony. Intimous DJs. Opie and Anthony. Talk show radio hosts. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Radio shock jocks. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  All right. We get it. Hey man voice. Oh you're hurting me. Yeah you know I am. Grandpa could you whip me up some ovaries. iTunes Apple store offers slew of programs and games. How about the game take picture of genitals send to friends. Now open open your cheeks up. I want to hear the sniffing.  On the very cheeks wide. My teeth hurt. Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Palaver.  Hi. Good morning. Good morning. How's everybody? What the hell day is it? Wednesday. It is whip them out Wednesday. All right. I lost track. It's whip them out Wednesday. Sometimes you just lose track of the days. Hi everybody. 
[00:01:30]  Wee. Wow. Phones are litter ready. Just in case you need it later on today. 877-212-ON-A. This is the Opie and Anthony show.  I like to say hi to the cops down there at the Midtown Tunnel. 
[00:02:00]  Ah. Let me off the hook.  Really? What do they get you for?  Well, I kind of roll through a stop sign over there. There's a certain way to get onto the tunnel, into the tunnel from Long Island City.  So, you kind of get in there and it's way over to the right-hand lane of the Midtown Tunnel and you kind of merge in and there's a stop sign.  It's more like a yield.  So, I went through and they're all standing there and they just wave me over.  I'm like, oh God. 
[00:02:30]  Then this Mariana Rivera looking guy comes up and asks me for a license and Reggie and everything.  I'm like, ah.  Fan him out.  Find one.  Here you go.  Oh yeah? Who's this guy?  Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  I'm going to extend the courtesy.  He's like, thank you, sir.  Thank you very much.  And continued on my way.  It's nice to be white, huh?  White and in America and in an SUV. 
[00:03:00]  It's fantastic.  Instead of getting that baton across the shins like that one gentleman in the news clip.  It's been all over the news.  There seems to be some gentleman that was arrested and another gentleman, an officer, was beating him with his baton because he wasn't complying.  The guy was not complying.  And if you watch the video clip, you'll see he keeps his arms tight to his chest and will not put him behind his back to be cuffed. 
[00:03:30]  So this officer is pummeling his shins.  Oh, and the guy's wearing shorts.  Oh, my God.  And he's just cracking his shins with the baton.  Right on the shin bone?  Yeah, yeah.  Right on the shin bone.  Right below the knee?  Oh, it had to hurt like hell.  Yeah.  But at that point, you know, put your goddamn hands behind your back.  Get arrested.  And now he's suing the city, of course.  But you go into protection mode.  Have you ever been, like, kicked or, like, attacked?  You kind of, like... 
[00:04:00]  Let me tell you something.  It's hard for you to just, like, unwind your arms and go, all right.  But, for the most part, someone had to start.  You know?  Someone had to start something.  I find it hard to believe there's a lot of cops out there that just start beating the crap out of people that are laying there complying.  You know?  If the guy's being a jackass and isn't putting his hands behind his back...  I think back in the day, maybe.  But now with all the cell phones, with the picture technology...  Cameras and...  And cameras all over the place.  I think the cops are smart enough to know, look, if I'm going to hit somebody, I better make damn sure. 
[00:04:30]  I'm doing the right thing here.  There's got a reason.  Because it's going to be on film somewhere.  They took the guy off the job for a while now and, you know, took his gun away.  I think the guy was completely in the right.  Yeah.  Guy wasn't complying.  Yeah.  Well, we got the news story.  Trying to be in full compliance.  Beating and arrest took place on Manhattan's Delancey Street near the FDR.  You can see one officer attempting to handcuff 46-year-old Michael Cephas while another tries to help. 
[00:05:00]  Then he begins to repeatedly strike the Brooklyn man on the kneecap and legs.  Two weeks later, Cephas, a disabled truck driver, shows his wounds.  And I told him there was no alcohol in the bag.  When the bag dropped and hit the ground, that's when he started swinging.  Both officers started swinging and hitting me, hitting me, hitting me.  Wait, this is over alcohol in a bag?  I don't know.  Oh, come on.  Whatever it is.  Come on.  Get your goddamn hands behind your back.  Alcohol in a bag? 
[00:05:30]  I thought, like, the guy was smuggling dope or something.  That's his story.  I don't know.  All right.  I didn't see the whole thing.  I just know them well.  Cephas says the arresting officers accused him of being drunk and resisting arrest.  You can see him raise his leg as if to block the officers, but he says that's only because he feared more beatings.  Cephas' defense lawyer says these pictures of his client's fresh wounds prove he'd already been struck before a bystander started rolling tape.  They violated my rights.  You know, I didn't do nothing.  You know, I just came to the park to have fun. 
[00:06:00]  Violate your rights.  You have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can, and it will be used against you in a court of law.  If it was your knees, they violated me.  Jesus.  Jesus, looks like someone's not going to be playing in the NFL anytime soon.  Put your damn hands behind your back.  In response to the police brutality accusations, the NYPD issued this statement.  The officer was placed on modified assignment after an attorney for the complainant contacted the Internal Affairs Bureau with a videotape of the incident last week. 
[00:06:30]  It is the subject of an ongoing internal affairs investigation.  I'm hurting right now.  You know, I'm really, I want an apology for sure.  Cephas is still charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, and criminal possession of a weapon for an umbrella.  He's accused of swinging at the cops.  The children's benevolent association is on record supporting the officer who struck these violent blows, saying Cephas was clearly resisting.  Cephas, Cephas, Cephas. 
[00:07:00]  There it is.  There it is.  Look.  Oof.  Ow.  That's got to hurt.  Guys, if the guy has his feet up blocking the baton, I mean, anytime you show a cop hitting a suspect, it's going to look bad because it just looks like a guy getting hit.  Of course.  But if they tell him those hands roll over on your stomach and put your hands behind your back, get cuffed, and move on.  That's easy to say, bro.  They got to look at him.  It's easy to say, but now they stopped beating him, and they were trying to get his hands behind his back. 
[00:07:30]  He's not frigging doing it.  Put your goddamn hands behind your back.  Oh, God, people.  No, don't give him the chance to beat you, silly.  That guy can't beat anyone, silly.  Take your arrest.  Guy's drinking out of a brown paper bag.  Deal with it in court.  All right.  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Jerry in Connecticut.  Jerry, what's up?  Jerry.  Hey, boys.  Good morning, Jerry.  Mr. Anthony.  Yes.  Time for you to apologize to all the black people. 
[00:08:00]  What happened?  The House of Representatives issued an unprecedented apology to black Americans for wrongs committed against them and their ancestors.  I think that's a good thing, because from what I know now, it was actually the House of Representatives that was there during slavery.  They rose from the dead and apologized for what they had done, because that's the only reasonable apology that could possibly happen.  Because why, generations later, would anyone apologize for anything? 
[00:08:30]  Unless there was zombie House of Representatives from the 1700s.  I don't want to hear it.  It's weird how people, like, an apology means something.  They're, like, hearing it from the Pope.  People really, like, abuse victims.  You know, victims, like, who are executed.  People who are executed when they've done something.  A lot of times, a victim's family goes.  I think even the victim liked the apology.  No, the victim didn't care for the apology.  But a lot of times, people go just to hear the apology. 
[00:09:00]  It means, it's something cathartic about it.  Oh, no.  Yes, sir.  That keeps saying my name.  Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.  Let's give it up money for you.  I know you're a millionaire.  It's time for reparations.  What?  It's time to give up the money.  There's no reparations.  And you know something?  Obama said something very interesting yesterday.  He was in front of black journalists, minority journalists, giving a little speech.  And boy, do they love him.  They stood up, standing ovation.  And they told people beforehand, like, don't do this. 
[00:09:30]  Just kind of let him come on and talk.  Oh, my God.  Whooping and hollering for Obama.  And then he was talking about how it's great.  He was talking about the American Indians and Hawaiians and African Americans.  And talking about how, you know, the government words are okay.  But they should, as far as reparations go, words are okay.  But I think the government ought to deal in deeds.  You know, not just words. 
[00:10:00]  Which, to me, is Obama is for reparations.  Is he just placating to his audience at that moment?  Then he's a phony.  I don't know what to make of that.  I read it and went, whoa, that's a little frightening.  Wouldn't that be stupid on his part?  He said it.  Then he's going to blow the election.  He said it.  No, he won't.  Because no one pays attention.  The stupid idiots that say, oh, I'm voting for Obama.  Why?  I don't know. 
[00:10:30]  Change.  Oh, I don't know.  He's got charisma.  They're the ones that don't listen or read between the lines or see what he's saying during  these speeches that he's giving.  Talking about reparations.  He probably doesn't know what reparations mean.  Oh, right.  You're right.  He thought it was something else.  He thought it was repairs.  Car repairs.  Auto repairs.  Yes, every American should have reparations done for free on their automobile.  Let's go to Carl in Savannah, Georgia.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, little Jimmy.  I heard you on the red eye last night on the satellite radio. 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  I just got a question.  Oh, man, it was great.  Thank you.  I noticed Jesse Ventura was on the show.  I didn't get to see the video.  I was listening on satellite.  Did you get to see Jesse in the studio?  Did he recognize you and want to talk a little bit about the conspiracy theories?  Well, the way red eye works is I sit next to Greg, and when they have the guest segment,  just to the nature of the studio, it's actually done in O'Reilly's studio.  I come out, and then the guest comes in for one segment.  It was Jesse.  And I saw him in the dressing room, and we said hello. 
[00:11:30]  We shook hands.  Hey, how are you?  And he seemed to be in a good mood, and we didn't.  Did he remember you?  I don't know.  I didn't think so by that.  It was friendly.  Yeah.  So I was talking to his publicist, the girl who comes with him, who's taking him around  for his book tour.  And I'm like, no, I don't even think he remembered me.  She's like, you really?  I'm sure he did.  He just wasn't.  He was fine.  Yeah.  We said hello.  I mean.  Why don't you promote red eye?  You do that.  I forget.  You do that quite often.  I was so mad about it.  Jimmy does red eye from what?  Once a month?  Once every three weeks?  Okay.  Twice a month.  Twice a month.  You should be promoting it.  I'm so annoyed that I forget that morning, because I don't get the notes for that afternoon, 
[00:12:00]  and then I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm doing it.  Right.  Yeah.  I got to start writing that down in advance, man.  I'm like pissed at myself.  All right.  Thank you, Carl.  Let's go to Jared in Syracuse.  Jared.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Jared?  Nothing.  You guys said that you're supposed to be back on up here in Syracuse, but they got that  stupid shut up and rock crap going on still.  Yeah.  Well, breaking news.  We're not going back on in Syracuse.  You're stuck with shut up and rock instead of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:12:30]  Well, I get it out in Rochester as well, because I live between the two of them, so I got  to wait until like two o'clock in the afternoon to even catch what you guys are even talking  about all day.  This is how stupid regular radio is.  Really?  It really is.  Unless you're like a personality-driven radio show, like ourselves.  Why would you go with a program called Shut Up and Rock, where most of your listeners  have something called Pandora's Box?  Yeah.  AOL Radio.  AOL Radio.  There's plenty of things. 
[00:13:00]  There's plenty of shut up and rock opportunities out there for the average listener.  On your very small phone these days.  Right.  We talked about it years ago.  You see, you know, when you don't have to walk around with things.  People will walk around with a cell phone, a personal digital assistant, and some type  of music device.  They've smashed it all together into very small phones these days.  And it's just at the forefront right now.  But in no time, these things are going to be all over and even more amazing. 
[00:13:30]  And you're going to be getting your music on your phone.  And amazing quality.  Everything you want.  Your choice of music.  Whether you want it to play automatically.  So you get a little surprise for your tunes.  Or you want to search and program in whatever bands you want to hear.  Yeah.  That's the future of what's happening as far as shut up and rock goes.  And you downloaded Pandora's box in what?  Two minutes today?  It took two minutes for me to do in the office. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  That app.  And you search out audio.  Before you know it, Alice in Chains is just playing on my iPhone.  Crystal clear audio.  Crystal clear.  It's just.  That's shut up and rock.  And then regular radio is just in there.  What do we do?  They're just watching the competition just stomp all over them.  And as more.  We don't know what to do with this one either.  As more cars put the jacks in also.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Like I said, my Mustang has one.  Yeah.  So I pop my iPhone in there and right through my radio, I can tune in whatever the hell I want.  Right.  Why wouldn't you do that?  Content is king.  Right.  So this dumb station in Syracuse, watch how they fail with their dumb shut up and rock.  Yeah, that's what people want in the morning is shut up and rock where they could do that with their iPhones and their iPods and their BlackBerrys and every other damn phone out there at this point. 
[00:15:00]  And it's only going to get better in the coming months.  Not years.  In the coming months.  So what does a radio station do?  They take a show off like ours, which is special.  We're offering something that you can't get from your iPhone.  Yeah, you can't just pop it on.  And then you put on something that is shut up and rock, which you could do on your own anyway.  Readily available on your phone.  With no commercials, by the way.  No commercials.  People are shut up and rocking without commercials. 
[00:15:30]  You dummies!  At least, and this is no rah-rah for the company or anything, but at least CBS is part of that.  You know, if you go to AOL Radio, CBS has a bunch of stations, including this one, our station here in New York, BCN in Boston, and a bunch of CBS stations are available on your iPhone.  They're at least thinking, like, all right, this is here.  It's here to stay.  It's only going to get bigger.  So let's become part of it.  Yeah, they understand they've got to be part of it or they're going to be F'd. 
[00:16:00]  I never saw a company go from zero as far as technology and a web presence and the internet and any of this new technology goes to where they are now than CBS.  They really have embraced the technology.  So, Jared, there you go.  You're in Syracuse and you're stuck with shut up and rock.  Let's just sit back and watch how that works for everybody.  Yeah.  Bunch of dopes at Citadel.  Dopes!  Ugh.  I call it something else.  I don't call it Citadel.  I call it something and it rhymes with sit. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Citadel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I say Citadel.  Exactly.  Isn't it funny?  Midadel?  No.  Oh, little gloves?  Oh.  Oh, I get it.  Javier.  Javier.  How are you?  Javier.  Javier, what's up?  Morning, boys.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Real good.  You're in Philly?  Yeah, I guess along the same lines.  This is this guy in Syracuse.  Any plans on coming back to Philly?  Well, you know, we have a big audience in Philly. 
[00:17:00]  They want us back on the radio down there, but the company's just kind of bollygagging.  We should be back on in Philly.  That's so obvious.  It's painful.  Yeah.  What are they doing in the morning right now?  Are they doing some kind of shut up and rock format too?  Just playing some tunes?  Yeah.  I mean, after they got rid of Kid Chris, I figured they'd try to get you back.  But, I mean, it's nothing.  We're sitting here waiting, and the fans down there wanted, and we were doing well when 
[00:17:30]  they did take us off the air.  They wanted to move in a different direction, and this, oh, whatever.  Don't get me started on that whole situation again.  I almost blew up my career yelling and screaming about that one.  But trust me, the people that thought they knew better didn't know, and they're now not  working at that radio station anymore.  So, it's perfect.  Get us back on in Philly.  I think a lot of people, it's a wait-and-see attitude.  Stop with the wait-and-see.  No, they've got to wait and see what happens on the space-based side of our career. 
[00:18:00]  Well, Philly's playing Guns N' Roses November Rain, so, you know.  Hey, wow.  I haven't heard that song in maybe two days at this point, so that's good.  And I could punch that up on my phone in seconds.  In seconds.  I can't.  You can't.  Can you really, right now?  Hmm?  Can you?  Yeah.  Let's put the challenge.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Well, I'm new to this.  Travis would probably be a lot better.  Find November Rain starting...  Oh, no. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Now.  Okay, hold on.  I want to see how long it takes you to find November Rain on your own.  Oh, no, I can't search.  Watch it be like auto-loading the film into a stupid camera.  Yeah.  40 minutes later.  It's a piece of cake.  Come on.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Okay.  See, regular radio's got to wake the F up.  Roses.  All right, you're 20 seconds in.  Hold on.  25 seconds in.  I don't have G3.  All right.  It's okay, though.  All right.  All right.  You're pushing 30 seconds, trying to find November Rain on your iPhone. 
[00:19:00]  Damn it.  Okay, hold on.  Where am I?  I'm living, let die.  He's panicking.  Well, you've got to live and let die.  You're up to 40 seconds.  You can do this under a minute.  Come on.  I know.  Are you doing, you're queer?  Are you panicking?  He's panicking.  Come on.  Oh, God.  45.  I'm panicking.  You're so stupid.  50 seconds.  Because, Travis, help me.  Help me, Travis.  What happened?  You had live and let die.  I know.  I don't know what just happened.  He's closing all his mail-to-mail instant messages. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  Well, Anthony just got Pandora's box.  A great app for the iPhone.  That Pandora's a real bitch.  All right.  Look, Travis has had it for a while.  Travis, Jimmy.  No, not Jimmy, because he'll go obscure.  No, I won't.  Anthony, give Travis a song.  I want that one.  No, because he's already been finding it.  Can I name a song?  I have a good one.  No, that's not it at all.  All right.  Jimmy is going to give you a song to find, Travis.  Happy Birthday to Me.  Say.  Say.  All right. 
[00:20:00]  How about, what's a good Doobie Brothers song?  What's the one they sang on What's Happening when Rerun dropped his tape recorder?  No, what's the song they were saying when Rerun dropped his tape recorder?  That recording studio he had under his jacket?  Yeah, which one was that?  I don't know.  I want to say just China Grove, because that's my favorite Doobie Brothers song.  Oh, Black Water is a good one, though.  That's it.  That's the one, I think.  Oh, it was.  Oh, Black Water.  And then, yeah, Rerun got in big, big trouble.  In front of the concert, like, all the concert coaches noticed the tape recorder's face? 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  Travis, can you find Black Water?  And then Quincy came up, please, please, can I talk?  Who sings it?  Oh, my God.  All right, ready?  Doobie Brothers?  Doobie Brothers, Black Water, find it.  That's not.  That's America.  That's America, you dummy.  But I hit Black Water.  Yeah, so did I.  Okay.  Yeah, that's great.  Good commercial for Pandora's box.  Wonderful, guys.  Gives you a song by the band.  Oh, that's not even the band.  No, that was America.  That's America.  Oh. 
[00:21:00]  I got Steve Miller bands.  That's interesting.  This is a great application.  Don't get me wrong.  We're falling flat on our faces.  Okay.  Well, radio rules.  Yeah.  Radio still rules.  All right.  I'm sorry.  We got two for Tuesday.  You do get two Metallicas.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Regular radio does rule.  Javier, I don't know what to tell you.  I've been begging and pleading and saying, what are you waiting for?  So, we'll have to wait and see on that.  Thanks, Javier.  Javier.  Javier.  Javier.  Javier. 
[00:21:30]  Can't you just change your name to, I don't know.  Javier?  Jake?  Yeah.  Javier.  I'm a fancy man.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  We got to talk about Jerry Lewis when we get back.  What?  You know, he's dead.  Jerry.  Jerry Lewis died?  No, don't spread rumors like that.  You know where those go.  You dope.  You got me.  But I acted like I knew him, too, for a second.  Really?  Guy I never met or thought about in four years?  It's possible.  It's not like he's a kid. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And a great story, one of those extreme home makeover houses is in foreclosure.  Yep.  We've been talking about this crap off and on, you know, for the last few months.  Yeah.  That these people, they give them, you know, a fine mansion, and then they leave, and then,  well, good luck paying the taxes, good luck doing, you know.  Take care of it.  Take care of it.  Well, they kind of screwed up, too.  Yeah.  A lot of the volunteers that worked on that house are a little angry at what they did.  Oh, really?  All right.  Yes, we'll tell you about it. 
[00:22:30]  After this, Opie and Anthony.  The last time I saw a pair of jugs, that big two hillbillies were blowing on them.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Get a wow sticker, get flashed, get happy.

[00:23:00]  Yes.  Oh, this is incredible.  Yeah.  Danny and Travis are helping us with Back to the Future trivia.  So we're going to see how much these guys know.  I see Danny, another expert, has walked into it to join us here.  There's been a petition floating around for at least probably two or three years already  to get the Marty McFly 2015 Nikes produced by Nike.  And finally, finally, this dream.  This dream has come to fruition.  Can I tell you?  What about the self-drawing jacket? 
[00:23:30]  There's no working on that one.  Ah, damn it.  It's the pinnacle of sneaker technology from the late 80s.  Yeah.  And it sticks to a hoverboard like no other sneaker can.  Yeah.  Plus, if you're looking at the movies and a big hologram shark from Jaws 15 comes out  of you, as long as you've got your 2015 Marty McFly's on, you're going to be able to avoid  it.  Is that another Back to the Future reference?  Of course it is.  I don't give a crap about it.  Of course it is.  You've got to watch the movie.  Oh, yeah.  Eighteen more times like we have.  I know. 
[00:24:00]  Back to the Future was a groundbreaking film.  Of course.  And an achievement in cinematography.  Why was your different girlfriend?  Uh, because, uh, Elizabeth Shue, who played the, uh, girl, I believe, uh, had prior commitments.  No, her mother actually, uh, diagnosed with cancer and she spent a lot of time in camera  mother, so she couldn't commit to the actress.  How do you know this?  Not a very big part, though, for the girlfriend.  Yeah.  They had to take her back because they didn't plan on making a sequel when they finished  the first one.  And when Doc comes back, of course, he says, Marty, Marty, it's your kids. 
[00:24:30]  So they had to take them both back.  And then they just laid her on a bench and left her for a while.  What are they turning to?  You can't say that.  You can't say that on the air, but we know what you're going to say.  Everyone knows the line, Travis.  I think, didn't they re-shoot some of the first movie scenes?  Yes, they did.  With the new girl, yeah.  When she walks up to Marty, uh, as Marty's looking at his brand new truck, his four-wheel  drive 1980s truck.  At the same time, Biff is, uh, waxing the car. 
[00:25:00]  Uh, of course, uh, Biff turned out to be the guy just waxing the car.  And I like how, um, how, um, the McFly's come back from, uh, uh, tennis, I believe.  Yeah.  And comment on, uh, Biff, uh, I hope that's the second coat of wax.  And, uh, they, they, they discuss how they met through Biff.  Right.  Through Biff's attempted rape.  Right.  Of, of, uh, Marty's mom.  It's like, oh, if it wasn't for Biff, we never would have met.  Oh, that's right.  He was trying to rape mom in the car. 
[00:25:30]  Because that's George McFly's way of looking at Biff waxing that car and saying, who's  raping who now, Biff?  Oh, okay.  I always wondered about that.  Why would they invite the rapist?  Right.  The man that actually was trying to rape your wife, uh, over to your house to wax your car.  He's humiliating him.  Biff is now his manservant.  Because he is.  He walked in very excited with the books.  Yeah.  I'm just finishing it now.  Biff.  Now, Biff.  Okay, you got me.  Don't con me. 
[00:26:00]  You got me.  You got me.  All right, stop it!  For the love of God, just stop!  Holy!  Stop!  Oh, my God!  All right.  Can you tell?  Oh, that is holy!  Just stop!  Can you tell we like the movie?  Get us out of here, Iraq! 
[00:26:30]  Moving right along with the Opie and Anthony Shoup.  Rich Voss in studio.  One of the comedians playing the PNC Bank Art Center this Saturday in Homedale, New Jersey.  Tickets still available.  They're going to be available all the way up until showtime, of course.  Unless we get up to 17, no, I think like 19,000 people.  We're going to do very well, but not that well.  It's going to be a perfect day for the show on Saturday, too.  That's very good news, yes. 
[00:27:00]  Ooh.  So we'll see everybody at the PNC this Saturday.  All the comedians you know and love from this radio show.  Get your tickets now through Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster.com.  And giving away a car during the comedy show this year.  How about that?  From allamerican4.net.  Details coming up.  Or you can go to owendayradio.com.  Texters, get ready, though.  We're going to be doing a little texting in the very near future.  Lots going on today, but I want to talk about Fat Princess.  This thing is making me laugh. 
[00:27:30]  Steve?  There you go.  The first joke is already out.  Yes.  Let's keep a joke tally on this one.  Yes, I'm a princess.  That was improv.  What is Fat Princess?  Well, feminists cry foul over Fat Princess.  I want to set it up that way, Anthony.  It's a video game.  That makes sense.  And the feminists are not happy about this one.  Why are they usually so easygoing?  Yeah.  She's plump, powerful, and ready to cause more controversy than supersize me. 
[00:28:00]  Who stars in this, Rose O'Donnell?  Fat plump.  That's just mean, Rich.  That's nice.  Rose O'Donnell.  She's been struggling with her weight.  What's that?  She's struggling.  We don't go for that type of humor here.  The Open Anthony program.  You take that to another show.  Who are they talking about?  Toadie Fields?  That's what I was getting asked.  Come on.  Rose O'Donnell hasn't been on TV in like three years at this point.  Find another fat bitch. 
[00:28:30]  She's doing video blogs.  Maybe you can like update your reference a little bit.  My God.  Oh, for one.  There's other fat chicks out there you could go with.  Bill from Waterford.  Voss starts out with a bang.  You can read the sarcasm.  That's amazing.  He was this close to saying Roseanne Barr.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Toadie Fields.  Barbara Stanwyck.  Who is she?  Ethel Merman? 
[00:29:00]  We get it.  It's old.  All right.  She's Fat Princess, the star of Sony's upcoming video game of the same name.  Debuting at last week's E3 Expo, the colorful fat princess is a capture the flag game with a twist.  You could thwart capture attempts by locking the once-thin princess in a dungeon and stuffing her full of cake, thereby increasing her girth and making her harder for your enemies to haul back to home base. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, wow.  Look at her.  Yeah.  She is fat.  So basically, you capture her.  You throw her in this little dungeon.  Feed her cake.  You feed her cake to make her really fat, and I think this is hilarious.  Let's go to the feminists, or at least the feminists are sticking with what's important.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're remaining relevant.  There's no such thing as feminists.  They're just a branch of the Democratic Party.  They never speak out when it comes to stuff like when Clinton abused his power, which, whatever. 
[00:30:00]  They didn't speak out against him, but they did speak out.  Well, they did.  No, I'm saying, but they never come out because they're obsolete.  They're a thing of the past.  It's women and whatever have everything they need in this country, so there's no reason  for feminists anymore.  There's nothing they can't get.  You know, you're actually right, but however, what bothers me about this is this is a conversation  Rich has had alone in the car.  This is what gave it away.  You did not just think feminists don't exist. 
[00:30:30]  This is a semicolon.  Feminists don't exist, semicolon, because we know something's coming.  They're just a branch of the Democratic Party.  They are.  I've had this argument before, and don't think everything you say in life is the first time  you said it.  I agree.  I've had this argument before, and I think they're just a special interest group when  it comes to the Democratic Party.  That's all.  That's the type of thing he would say to Sean Hannity, just to get Sean to clap him on  the back and go, very insightful.  Yeah, good.  I like the way you think.  You think all the way in today, it's like, I'm going to show those guys I'm smart today.  I know I could do it. 
[00:31:00]  Well, the last time I was in, in the beginning, I come off very smart in the beginning, and then  I kind of fold and fall apart.  The beginning of what?  My radio interview.  This is not a radio interview.  I know.  Sit down and just shut up.  My radio interview.  What are you?  You're a featured guest?  You're just a slob.  Yeah, what do you think?  You think there was a rider in the green room?  What is Rich like when he comes?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you're just like Mike Myers.  Getting ready for the big Rich Voss interview on the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:31:30]  Mike was a nice guy, but I'll take Voss any day.  Ah, agreed, agreed.  See, that was a compliment.  Thank you.  All right, listen.  That was a compliment.  We got a feminist gamer.  Her name is Mighty Pony Girl.  Well, she rings in diplomatically, suggesting a new way to play the game altogether.  Oh?  Instead of feeding the once hot princess cake, this is what this gamer suggests.  Instead of running out into the forest to find cake to fatten up the princess with, why  not go out and find gold, which is a lot heavier than cake, to stuff into a treasure chest? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  The more gold in the chest, the heavier it would be, and the harder it would be to carry,  she said, before adding, oh, but that's not as cute as cake and fat chicks, right?  What do they call that?  Well, yeah, right, Jew.  It's funny, yeah, why didn't Donkey Kong, why did it have to be a fat man with a mustache  they were rolling the barrels at?  Yeah.  Why couldn't it be a gorilla rolling down the barrels for another gorilla? 
[00:32:30]  Just like two gorillas playing.  They're just playing with barrels.  Yeah.  Don't be so sensitive.  That sounds like the friggin' wife game anyway.  Just get her, and she gets all fat on you.  Can't get her out of the house?  Can't get her out of the house.  She eats cake and gets fat.  It's called the You're Married Game.  And I'm going to have a real tough time with this next sentence, but I'm going to try.  Writer Melissa McEwen cuts to the chase about this fat princess game they're at, telling 
[00:33:00]  Sony she's positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation  of fat-hating, heteronormative, what is that word?  I've never seen it.  Heteronormative a-holes?  No.  Can we look that word up?  I don't know what that is.  Heteronormative?  Normative a-holes.  Heteronormative a-holes.  That's probably a fancy word of saying that if you're heterosexual and you have a certain sense of what you consider 
[00:33:30]  normal and acceptable.  Right.  Very good, Jimmy.  I'm guessing that if you're normal-centric, that you're an a-hole because you don't approve  of, you criticize a fat person who goes into Starbucks and gets a piece of pumpkin loaf.  Right, exactly.  See, we don't criticize that.  What we criticize is the fact that we have to sit next to you on a plane and your disgusting  addiction affects us.  See, if you sit on a plane, if they put you in the cargo area and you and the other, like  bison, sit there and talk and make outdoor noises, we have no problem with you. 
[00:34:00]  I don't understand that, you know, being fat is a disease.  I just don't get it.  When you just stand in line at Starbucks and see what people order on a regular basis and  you're sitting there in line going, yeah, that's exactly what I want.  I love it.  But guess what?  I'm not going to go for that.  I don't have it.  Because I've decided I don't want to be, you know, overweight.  I think you're, we've said it a lot on this show, you're born with like a body type and  then it's really up to you what you're going to do with that body type. 
[00:34:30]  Are you going to, are you going to be 30 to 40 pounds heavier or are you going to be  maybe 10 or 15 pounds lighter than what you were born with?  Work your ass off to get down to a certain weight.  Right.  And while some people, yeah, they can stuff their face and not gain a pound.  It's just the way it is.  But these slobs, like Jimmy pointed out, goes into a Starbucks and just gets the fattiest  fat, fat muffin and a nice fatty, fat, fat drink.  Yeah.  Why don't we get Sam to go to the Starbucks today and do what's the haps? 
[00:35:00]  What's the fats?  Yeah.  What's the fat?  So let's, let's question fat people on why they're buying what they're buying.  Why are you getting that?  Why aren't parents accountable for...  Rich, slow down a second, please.  We're in the middle of trying to set something up.  Parents accountability.  Should we shut up?  I don't just throw crap out there and go, yeah, well, whatever.  This is good.  I'm setting up something that might work for the radio show.  Hold on a second.  That's actually...  You got a yield sign right now.  We'll go back to you in a second.  That idea, which I've seen...  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  That's why I had to stop him because I really think we got something here.  We got to just develop it live on the show.  But I've seen, like a lot of times, honest to God, I keep going back to this fat lady  I saw ordering something and I wanted to, I wish I had the guts to say, like on a camera,  why are you eating this?  Like, how do you respectfully say that to a fat person and go, honestly, like it's like  asking a smoker why they smoke.  There's got to be a way to do that and get the audio because, or I always sort of...  How about we just call it, why are you eating that?  Because the people would...  And then if they ask, well, that would be great audio because it's going to be a bit uncomfortable. 
[00:36:00]  Because it tastes good.  Really?  Well, you'll get a lot of bits, none of your business and stuff.  None of your business.  But that's good.  We'll send Kenny out with them.  No one's going to, like, you know, touch Sam if Kenny's around.  Ask, also ask people of normal weight.  And I do use the word normal.  And say, why are you eating that?  And you'd get like a smile.  I don't know.  It tastes good.  But I usually get one.  And if people ask, just go, well, I'm taking a survey for what?  For...  Pig magazine.  Slops. 
[00:36:30]  For Barn Monthly.  I hope you appreciate the assist, Jimmy.  Oh, of course.  All right.  The bounce pass right there to Jimmy.  By the way...  Can we do this?  I would love to.  What's the out, though, if a lot of people are going, why are you asking?  There's got to be some kind of maybe legitimate out.  Like, well, we're taking a survey for what?  Because we're doing a survey on, there's so much emphasis stressed on health.  And say, because a lot of overweight people have been suing the airlines and suing things.  And we're trying to find out, we're examining this disease, what makes somebody who's overweight 
[00:37:00]  order certain things that are going to further that cause.  So there's got to be a nice way to say that.  It's not Brian.  Well, the city just enacted this law that the restaurants have to put the calories out  in front of everybody.  So we can ask if they're paying attention to it.  And did this change your perception?  Because we are at CBS Radio, Sam's got news chops now.  Yeah.  We can go out and follow up on the new law.  Can we get him one of those reporter hats?  Oh, sure.  A drudgy hat?  What, like, drudge with a fedora with a little press pass in it?  We're trying to get press credentials. 
[00:37:30]  In L.A., they're passing a law in South L.A. that no more fast food stores are allowed  to be open.  No new ones in poor areas.  No new ones.  In poor restaurants.  In poor areas.  Because they probably figure that all, like, ghettos get is this crap like McDonald's  and Burger King.  There's no, there's no, in fried chicken, there's no places to go.  Well, what nice restaurants take food stamps?  Those places take them.  You're screaming at me.  And what do they think are going to open up in their place?  A fine dining restaurant?  You know, you're not going to get that.  But listen, K-Law Wing. 
[00:38:00]  Hold on.  I just want to add to that because Patrice has brought this up on the show.  I'm like, shut up, poor people don't eat right, you know, because they don't have the funds  to eat right.  I didn't really believe that.  But I do this bike path on the west side of Manhattan and I go way uptown.  I think it's, I'm assuming it's like Spanish Harlem because no one speaks English.  Uptown.  And the vending machines sell, next time I'll take a picture on Opie's Eye.  They are selling stuff.  I don't even know what it is, but I can tell you this much, it's not healthy. 
[00:38:30]  It's parts of, like, meat.  I can't even call it parts of chicken because I don't know.  It's meat products that I've never seen before that no white guy would ever eat.  Simple as that.  In vending machines?  No, no.  Did I say vending machines?  Oh, vendors.  A vendor.  Yeah, a vendor.  I'm sorry.  They got the vendors set up in this park area and people are hanging, you know, like you  would.  And, you know, in Midtown, it's hot dogs and stuff like this.  They're selling stuff that is nowhere near a hot dog. 
[00:39:00]  You know, a lot of grizzle, a lot of fat, just like the crap that I think most butchers  would just chop and throw in the garbage.  Scrapple burgers.  It's cheaper, but it's a lot more work to go to the store and buy stuff and make it yourself.  It's always been cheaper that way.  The only time I ever cooked for myself was when I was broke, completely broke.  You'd go through the cushions for change and you'd buy, like, some friggin' pasta and  sauce or something like that.  And it would be cheaper than going to the deli and grabbing a sandwich or something. 
[00:39:30]  But people are, they're lazy.  People are just lazy.  Fat and lazy is what this country is.  Well, can I get back to my point?  I'm sorry.  Oh, boy.  Did I cut you off?  Parents are not accountable.  It's child abuse when you're stuffing your face and your little kid's face.  When your kid is three years old and he's 200 pounds, all right, there's nothing this  kid could do.  There's nothing this kid could say at dinner, hey, mom, that's not healthy.  I'd like to have something else, all right?  You don't feed your kid alcohol or drugs. 
[00:40:00]  Why do they do it with food and why are they not accountable and how can they, you know?  It's ridiculous because they're just fat loats that don't care about themselves.  The disease angle comes in like this because alcoholism has been classified as disease.  It's not the, it's the, the, the, this compulsion, it's the, the ISM at the end, the ISM, that's  kind of what makes it, but that's still not an excuse.  Like, I'll acknowledge food addiction is a real addiction.  I mean, it's horrible.  I'm glad I don't have it.  But that said, it's still not, it's still not an excuse as to why you can't make a decision. 
[00:40:30]  Why can't you be addicted to salads, though?  I agree.  Or something else.  That's what I, that's the part I don't get.  You have to, what?  You have to consume more food because you're addicted to food.  But why do you, you go for the, the, the easy stuff?  Because of the, the sugar rush is in most of the bad food.  I'm not making excuses for them, but that's the reality of it.  It's comfort food.  It's like, like fat kids who, who, who, who hide and get away by eating.  The same way some kids, like burnouts won't go and get high when they want to run away.  A lot of fat kids will just do it with food.  They just, you zone out and you're acting out an addiction. 
[00:41:00]  I chose to, you know, eat healthy a long time ago and it's not easy.  Like, I don't want to eat a dry, boring salad.  So I've spent the last, I don't know, many years just searching out stuff that is tasty,  but is good for you.  And it's not easy.  It's never going to be as good as a big slice of a pound cake or something.  Well, sure.  And then you have what's called a cheat day.  Eat whatever you want.  Oh, good gravy.  Well, you know, biggest loser taught me that.  It's cost me every relationship.  Oh, wrong subject. 
[00:41:30]  Let me, all right, let's go to Doug in Syracuse.  He's not happy with us, I believe.  Doug, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I'm not unhappy.  I just want to say, first off, I'm a big guy.  I don't believe food's an addiction.  Okay.  I'm saying that right now.  I disagree with you, but.  Well, I mean, like, there are compulsive eating as an addiction,  but not just in general being fat as a disease.  No, no, being fat is not,  but it's almost like with sex or anything else. 
[00:42:00]  There is, and by saying it's a disease,  it's not copping out and saying you're not responsible  or you're not accountable.  You are accountable for it.  And if you're, like, making the decision to always eat cake,  well, to me, you have to be accountable for that.  But just saying it's a disease doesn't remove the, like, accountability.  And food, it's not that the food is the addiction.  You're the addict, and that's your drug of choice.  Okay?  It doesn't matter if you're using food, gambling, or whatever.  So, you know, you're filling the void with food.  That's all. 
[00:42:30]  So why don't you just get on a treadmill  and quit calling a radio show, all right?  Well, he didn't say anything harsh yet.  Yeah, well, relax.  I'm just trying to help him out.  I'm trying to help him.  I'm giving him tough love, all right?  Maybe a little tough love.  You know how many Dougs you're going to see  at the PNC Bank Art Center Saturday?  Two.  We don't seem like 5,000.  Relax.  There's going to be a lot of Doug types in the audience there, Rich.  Hello, Doug.  What do you got?  I'm sorry.  Sorry for Rich's harsh talk.  Damn.  The reason I was calling is about the airplane thing.  Yeah.  I'm a lawyer and a big guy. 
[00:43:00]  I don't believe people have a right to sue the airplanes.  As long as being a big guy, you can fit in the seat.  I'm a 48 waist.  I have no problem getting the seatbelt over me  and sitting in the seat.  If I was bigger than that and couldn't get the seatbelt on,  fine, people can complain.  But when I fly and I can fit in the seat,  I don't want to have to hear from very thin people next to me  that I'm ruining their flight.  Well, you probably do when you get up 
[00:43:30]  and you're a little cranky around the rear  and you've got to squeeze past their face.  Plus, you're big and you're used to your own smell,  but as a skinny person.  Doug, let me ask you the question.  Have you really, and I only go by experiences I've had  and where I'm uncomfortable.  Do you think people really, if you're completely not in their space,  do you think people really go out of their way to go, 
[00:44:00]  oh, you're ruining my flight?  I'm talking about people that are obviously overweight,  not 10, 15 pounds, 20 pounds even.  People that are 60 pounds overweight  that are complaining that the seats are built  for the 95% or whatever people that are flying.  I'm not talking about them.  I'm telling you, most of the time, my flight's defined.  But every now and then, I'll be getting into a seat  and I always book either an aisle or a window seat  so either I can get up without touching anybody 
[00:44:30]  or if I'm in the window, I don't get up for the flight  for no looking wine.  But every once in a while, just when I'm getting into the seat,  I get a look from someone sitting next to me like,  here we go, here he comes.  Well, yeah.  I fit in the seat.  I'm not spilling over on their armrests.  I don't touch them.  I'm not talking to them.  But they're looking at me like,  thank you, Mr. Guy, for ruining my flight  just by your being alive.  Do you know what I think they should do?  Honestly, I think planes should have this. 
[00:45:00]  I think, like, you have a seat  and you have an armrest dividing the two seats  and you have to fight for the armrest.  The old comics do that joke.  I think there should be, like, a little divider  that you can raise out of the armrest  which partitions your seats completely evenly.  Wow.  Yes.  Not far up, but maybe it goes up, say, nine inches  or eight inches or whatever.  And this way, you can't bleed into somebody's seat.  Right, let your own fat sit there against some partition.  And you each have to share the armrest evenly.  This way, if the armrest is down  and there's no one next to you, 
[00:45:30]  you can rest on the whole thing.  But if someone wants to raise it...  You can't get planes to give you pillows now.  They're going to build...  What's that, buddy?  I want us all in little cubicles on a plane.  I don't want to see other people.  I don't want other people...  We don't want to see you.  I want to talk to them.  All right.  I'm sorry it was harsh to you.  Thank you, Doug.  And he's right,  because I brought a baby on a plane,  so I know...  That is the worst.  But maybe you have to.  Crying messes.  All right, Doug, thank you.  We're trying to move on.  Hey, speaking of planes,  it came out today that...  I forgot which airline it is.  Maybe StumpRank could help us out. 
[00:46:00]  But if you check a second bag,  $50.  Yeah.  If you check a third bag,  it's over $100.  So you pay the $50  and then another $100 on top of that.  Is it American Airlines?  I'm not sure.  Maybe we can find out which airline.  That's just unbelievable.  Yeah, they once again  stick it to people  who are traveling for pleasure,  because most business travelers  have a carry-on  or U.S. Airwaves.  They stink anyway.  Oh, U.S. Airwaves?  They're terrible.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, let's go back to Kent.  This started with Fat Princess, 
[00:46:30]  the video game.  Is it really bent?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Kent?  Wow.  I went to E3 this year  where they debuted this game.  And first of all,  it's not a game  you can pick up in stores.  You have to download it  onto your PlayStation.  The kids aren't going to be able  to go and even pick this up.  Right.  And on top of that,  it's rated M  because it's super violent.  It's cute looking,  but there's blood and guts  all over the place.  Yeah, but it's like  primitive blood. 
[00:47:00]  It's cartoony.  Yeah, we're looking at some videos  of this fat princess.  No GTA.  It got it at an M rating,  so kids,  I mean,  they would need  their parents' credit card  and their parents  would have to be there.  I mean,  it's going to be pretty hard.  No, it's not even...  You're missing the point, sir.  It's not that they're trying  to keep this game  away from kids in general.  They don't want this game  being played by anyone  because you make  the skinny princess fat  by feeding her cake.  Oh, no,  but one of the ladies  you were talking about, 
[00:47:30]  she said they were going  to raise whatever,  you know,  she was saying kids  are going to grow up  to be whatever  in the article,  you know,  hating fat people  or whatever.  The kids are going to...  Like, no one's going  to play this game anyway.  I mean,  it's a tiny little game  by a bunch of nerds  in a cubicle.  I mean,  this is...  Yeah, no one would have  known about it.  ...by like five people.  Yeah,  I love these people.  These feminists  have no idea  that they just turned  on a lot of people  to this fat princess.  None of us would have  known about fat princess  unless they made  their dumb statement.  So I'm watching 
[00:48:00]  some of these...  They look kind of like  gnomes feeding cake  to the princess  and she's getting  fatter and fatter.  That's crazy.  3D South Park graphics.  I mean,  it's really...  Yeah,  it's not going  to take off.  It's no...  Like Anthony says,  no GTA.  It's only cost 10 bucks now.  Right.  It's a $10 game.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Let me...  One more here.  This is a...  This is a dumb one.  Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey. 
[00:48:30]  Listen,  I got to agree with Rich  on what he said before  about parents  being held accountable  because, I mean...  Listen,  I was 320 pounds  back in March  and now I'm down  to 280  and I just have  like a revelation.  I started eating salads  for dinner every night  with like light,  balsamic vinegar dressing  and stuff  and I make sure  my kids don't eat  the way I ate  growing up  you know,  because my son  constantly asking,  you know,  daddy,  can I have a snack?  I'm like,  yeah,  but it's going to be  like an apple  or something  that's great.  You're not going to be  stuck in cakes  on your throat.  Right.  I apologize to Matt 
[00:49:00]  because it says  on the screen  I'm overweight  and I make sure  my kids eat right  so they don't turn out  like me.  So I'm assuming  that you're forcing  salads and apples  and crap  into your kids' mouths  as you continue  eating horribly  because a lot of parents  will do that  like,  oh,  you know,  they'll smoke  in front of their kids  or drink in front  of their kids  and then like,  don't do what I'm doing.  It was like saying  not as I do.  Yeah,  they're very influential  and if you're sitting  there eating like crap  and telling them  they need to eat right,  they're not going to learn.  They're not going to learn  that lesson.  I was eating like crap 
[00:49:30]  for the longest time  until like four months ago  I just like said,  wow,  I can't keep doing this myself  because I gained like,  I was like 180 pounds  when I met my wife  and now I was 320  but that was like five years ago.  You must be happy.  I got a fact  from Stunt Brain  it is our culture too.  Americans eat an average  of 3,770 calories a day.  What's the,  what are you supposed to  like,  2,500?  Something like that.  The most of any  developed country in the world.  All right.  It's also our culture.  How about,  we probably also have  the most gyms  per square mile too. 
[00:50:00]  I mean,  you see,  there's nothing but gyms  in this country too  so we're probably  on some level  one of the healthier countries  and I'm sick of hearing  us get completely trashed.  Hey,  what's that one,  Opi's?  I'm 30,  I'm fat  and I don't choose  to be this way.  Let's say hi to Scott.  Scott.  Hey,  how you doing guys?  All right.  Hey,  you know,  you guys have got a lot  of truckers in your fan base  there.  I just want to point out,  you know,  I would love to be healthy.  I had nine months off  from working  four years ago.  I got down to 270.  Now I'm back up to 350 
[00:50:30]  because I just don't have  time to stop.  But you know what?  Here's what I'm saying.  It's not that you got to eat  perfectly chef-cooked meals  every night,  but like when I'm in a place  and I got to buy  grilled chicken  or grilled chicken sandwich  instead of a Whopper,  like that's a decision  a person makes  and it's easy enough  to get grilled chicken  or to kind of be aware of it.  It's easy enough nowadays  to at least be conscious of it  and try to get something healthier.  You know how bad  I want a Whopper? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  I haven't had a Whopper.  I can't even tell you.  And man,  I want one right now.  They're the most delicious thing  on earth.  They're delicious.  They're delicious.  Oh man,  I'm with you.  I haven't had a Whopper  and I don't even know  how long.  Jimmy,  I do get grilled chicken.  So Scott,  I don't have time.  All I'm doing is sitting here,  man.  All right.  So you're saying  that you went from 270  to 350 or whatever  just by eating grilled chicken?  It doesn't make sense.  Because he's sitting down 
[00:51:30]  as a trucker.  He doesn't have time  to exercise.  He's not moving around.  He should start unloading  the trucks by hand.  Oh,  and Rich,  don't even get me started  on you.  Shut up.  At least I'm skinny,  stupid.  Okay.  How about that?  You forgot the end.  Yeah,  I know.  What?  At least I'm skinny.  That's great.  Jimmy,  he doesn't want to have  to sit next to me  on a plane.  Is that right?  It's not that I want  to sit next to you,  man,  but the seats are,  look,  the seats are kind of  uncomfortable even for me  and I weigh like 160.  So,  I mean,  I understand the seats 
[00:52:00]  are probably too small  for most people.  But when somebody's  that much bigger  than the rest of us  and they're complaining,  come on,  man,  you do make choices.  Look,  you think I like eating hell?  It stinks.  I want to eat pound cake  and shove it in my face.  I love crappy food.  It's delicious.  I love it.  I love it.  Apple turnovers,  Entenmann's chocolate donuts.  There's plenty of things.  Let's have a cheat day.  Come on,  Oph,  I don't want to do that.  Oh,  now it goes right to my hips.  I got a dumb,  like,  egg white sandwich  I'm about to eat. 
[00:52:30]  It's on a bagel  and I even throw  half the bagel away.  You know,  I want a tasty treat  from Starbucks.  All right,  I'll have egg whites today.  I'm going to go nuts.  A crazy person.  I just want to say,  hey,  Jimmy,  happy birthday.  Thank you, sir.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  Let's go to Erin in New Hampshire.  Erin.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, toots.  Hey.  I actually think that Rich  might have a point.  It's kind of scary,  but my parents,  I'm not saying it's their fault 
[00:53:00]  or anything,  but they brought me up eating,  you know,  they would cook up,  like,  frozen chicken nuggets,  frozen french fries,  and all that stuff,  so I was brought up eating,  like,  not really that healthy.  I mean,  I'm not,  like,  morbidly obese or anything.  I weigh,  like,  160.  I'm,  like,  size 12.  I'm not horrible,  but I mean,  I'm not saying it's entirely,  I'm 5'5".  5'5",  160.  You're a Tuesday night,  not a Friday.  Tuesday.  You're off the scale. 
[00:53:30]  My boyfriend doesn't seem  to think so,  but thanks.  Yeah,  because he's a Monday.  Ooh.  Oh,  Rich.  I'm just kidding with these.  Wow.  You guys are the meanest humans  on the planet.  No,  we're not.  Oh,  wait,  oh.  We're very caring.  We were in the car.  Wow.  Can you let her finish  after she turned into a blueberry  and Willy Wonka?  Go ahead,  sweetheart.  Ow.  Okay.  Well,  I just wanted to say  that a lot of it  does have to do  with the way you're brought up 
[00:54:00]  because you don't know  any different  when you're five  and six years old  and all you have  in front of you  is,  you know,  crap food  that your parents feed you.  Yeah.  And then once you get  old enough to decide,  it's all you know.  Yeah.  It's not all you know.  You just know it's bad.  You know what?  That's such bull,  man.  I wasn't,  my favorite food  in the world  is sushi.  My parents didn't feed it  to me when I was a kid.  Yeah.  We couldn't afford sushi  and I discovered it  like in my 20s  and it's what I like to eat.  Don't you just know 
[00:54:30]  that things are bad for you  that you're eating?  You just know it.  Right.  You know it's going to  make you fat.  You know it's going to,  it's not healthy.  No,  not now.  How long,  how old do you have to be  before you realize  that donuts and cake  are going to make you fat  where a salad  and maybe some chicken  won't make you fat?  46.  You're missing the point.  If you're a seven-year-old kid  and your mother's making  fettuccine Alfredo for dinner,  you can't say,  I don't want that.  It's not healthy. 
[00:55:00]  One,  you don't know.  You're seven,  you're eight years old.  It tastes good.  That's why they give you  the good metabolism  when you're younger.  Of course.  So you burn all that crap off  for the most part  and then you get to an age  and you're like,  whoa,  wait a minute.  I've got to really start  paying attention  to what I'm eating  and then you make the choice.  Am I going to continue  eating mama's food  or am I going to try  to get a little healthier?  By the time you're 18  everyone wasn't fat in school.  Everyone ate like crap.  Their parents fed them  like mostly garbage food  and stuff 
[00:55:30]  and you needed a couple  of fat kids  to make fun of in school  but for the most part,  everybody,  like Hope said,  you get that quick  kid metabolism going  and you're fine.  Little fatties there  to punch in the face.  Your life is set up  where you don't have  to worry about it  for the first,  what,  15,  17 years of your life.  God made it that way  but then guess what?  The metabolism starts  slowing down  and now you have  to make some decisions.  What decision  are you going to make?  That's up to you.  Nobody knows  that Anthony just said  you have to have 
[00:56:00]  a couple of fat kids  in school to make fun of  as that was part  of the decision.  Like it was a necessary  part of things.  Like well,  the Lord made it that way  because not every kid  is fat.  God understands.  And there's only a couple  of them in the playground  when you're a kid  and they're there  to point and laugh at.  Yeah,  you need just a couple.  You need a couple fatties.  And that should encourage  you to not eat  when you get older.  You also need  that one waterhead.  Well.  One waterhead,  a couple fatties  in school  makes the day fly by. 
[00:56:30]  Fatties,  waterhead,  one slut.  And one anorexic chick  where you're like,  you're too young  to understand  what that is  and you're like,  wow,  what is going on  with her?  And a guy  with a speech impediment.  Aw.  Oh, he stated that,  didn't we?  What's that?  Oh, Rich.  Oh, Rich.  He must have stood out  like a sore chromosome.  Chromosome.  Just, oof,  chromosome.  Not chromosome.  Wow.  Mousone.  Let's go to Adam.  We got to go to break here.  But Adam,  man,  this got the phones lit, huh?  Adam Boston, BCN.  What's up? 
[00:57:00]  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  I'm just overall  pretty sick of people  just complaining  about things  that really just  they can ignore.  For example,  all these fat people.  I mean,  these feminist groups  that complain  about things like that.  Just turn the other way,  you know?  I mean,  for serious,  honestly,  you must be pretty bored  or not have enough  problems of your own  that you're worrying  about stupid hypothetical  problems that other  people aren't even  bothered about.  Yeah.  What?  All right.  Hypothetical problems? 
[00:57:30]  I think my ADD kicked in.  I don't know what.  All right.  Thanks.  Hey, Nick in Jersey says,  I work with a fat guy.  He eats almost $75 worth  of food a night.  Going through the phones  real fast  because we're going  to clear the lines.  Eric, Minnesota,  I'm a trucker.  I lost weight.  It's all your own choice.  Dan in Knoxville,  I'm 44 waist.  I definitely spill over  into the next seat  because that other guy  said he doesn't spill  into the next seat  at a 48 waist.  He just has a big  fat head. 
[00:58:00]  Hammerhead the trucker.  You can be a trucker  and lose weight  if you want to.  I did.  Dave the trucker.  I'm a trucker.  I make time to exercise.  So some of the truckers  out there are pissed off  that that guy's saying,  look,  you don't have time  to keep yourself  in shape on the road.  Chris in Jersey,  fat people do everything  but blame themselves.  Art in Ohio,  fat people need to buy  two seats on a plane.  Paul in Brooklyn,  no,  it's not okay  to be size 48  and try to fit into a seat.  So that's just  some of the phone calls  coming in right now.  877-212-O&A. 
[00:58:30]  Rich Voss in studio  playing the PNC Bank  Art Center with us  this Saturday  in Homedale, New Jersey.  It's going to be  a great time, man.  You can still get  your tickets  and we're giving away  a car this Saturday  thanks to  allamericanford.net.  Speaking of which,  texters,  get ready.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show.  Big good morning  to everybody. 
[00:59:00]  Arnold Schwarzenegger,  61 today.  Good for him.  Paul Anka is 67.  Oh, we should play  our Paul Anka.  Ah, the clips.  Can't.  What?  Oh, Steve!  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Didn't we have a lot of fun  with Paul Anka  back in the day  with the guys get shirts?  Isn't that the guy?  Yeah.  Ah, you missed another one.  I hate him.  What'd you miss? 
[00:59:30]  What happened?  Paul Anka.  Ah, we, you know,  we talked to the guys.  I'm like, look,  you look at this stuff  and you see if you might  have something from  the old days that we,  ah, whatever.  You can play  the Paul Anka clips  with this fire.  It's so dirty, though.  I mean, would it be easier  to play it at SiriusXM?  That's why I just  have a new company.  How about we get that clip  and see if we can play it  over here?  It's some hidden audio  from back in the day  Paul Anka yelling  at his band.  It's great stuff.  Great stuff. 
[01:00:00]  And then Jimmy Hoffa  disappeared 33 years ago today.  Where'd he go?  And Brett Favre faxes  reinstatement letter  to the NFL.  Why does he stop?  Just go home.  These guys can't go home.  They realize their lives suck  if they're not, you know,  playing football.  Reinstatement letter.  How much attention  do you need, Brett?  The guy retired, like,  it seems, I swear,  like a month ago.  We were listening  to his speech.  Yeah, he couldn't accept  being retired.  He knows he has  another year or two left.  He doesn't.  He's 58.  He used to go 
[01:00:30]  head-to-head  with Aikman.  Yeah.  Be a broadcaster.  Do something.  Work with lepers.  Anything.  He's still got that  thing inside him.  I know.  I'm attacking him  because he's not lazy.  Yeah, he doesn't want  to go home.  How dope I am.  877-212-01A.  We cleared the phones  even though everyone  is just continuing  to call about being fat.  Sonny Farrelly  from Boston.  Sonny, what's up?  Hey, you guys are just  making a freaking  maniac out of me, 
[01:01:00]  I'm telling you.  But listen to me,  all right?  I've been, for the past  whole year,  I've been trying  to lose weight, okay?  And it's been  the hardest thing  that I've ever done.  I have to go to the gym  at least five times a week  for over an hour now.  They're telling me  I have to work  at the gym  for over an hour  to make it  any beneficial to me.  And I've been eating  like a freaking bird  as well, you know?  I really cut down  my consumption of food.  And what I have to say,  though, is that,  you know, when you, 
[01:01:30]  Opie and Anthony,  not so much Jimmy  because he gets it  because he's kind of like,  you know,  he's got that  slower metabolism,  but you two are blessed  with a higher metabolism  and you can eat  pretty much anything you want.  That is bull crap.  That's not true.  Dude, I walk home  every day.  I walk up  10 flights of stairs  every day.  I still squeeze the gym  in two to three times a week.  I go for very long  bike rides.  I'm constantly working  to keep my weight down. 
[01:02:00]  Rollerblading,  that's the choice  I've made.  And Sonia,  I'll tell you,  hold on,  I'll tell you something.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Anthony goes to the gym too  and he eats like a bird.  He literally doesn't eat  in the morning.  I don't eat nothing.  I've got to eat constantly.  Anthony eats a dry bagel  and some cantaloupe  and some cantaloupe  and some cantaloupe soda.  That's his breakfast  every morning.  Sonny,  if you went to a nutritionist,  they would tell you  to write down  everything you eat.  Okay?  And if you were being 
[01:02:30]  honest with yourself  and the nutritionist,  you'd be really surprised.  Like, wow,  I really thought  I was eating right.  No, no,  I'm agreeing with you guys.  I mean,  I do eat still  more than I should be,  but, you know,  it's hard  because I've been brought up  to, you know,  in a Mediterranean-type family,  you know,  eat, eat, eat.  And it was always  kind of like that comfort thing  that I was brought up  to eat, you know?  So, you know,  I understand  and I've been...  Is that a Mediterranean  family thing  or an American family thing?  We all have the grandma 
[01:03:00]  eat, eat, eat,  and they get insulted  if you don't eat.  I mean,  we all have the older relatives.  That's what it was about  back in the day.  People think,  oh, I'm going to have a salad,  but they're pouring  Russian dressing on it.  You know,  it's full of mayonnaise.  They don't have  low-fat dressing.  Eat low-fat everything,  whole wheat bread,  low-fat stuff,  and you could still,  you could eat ice cream  if it's low-fat yogurt.  It tastes just as good.  You know,  people,  they think,  well,  I'm eating less,  but I'm still eating garbage.  You know,  they just don't know.  They're not educated.  Honestly,  I don't care.  Honestly,  I don't care if someone's fat. 
[01:03:30]  I really don't  because for the most part,  it doesn't affect me.  I rarely am on a plane  next to a fat person  and if I'm annoyed  for the flight,  by the time I'm at baggage,  I could care less.  I really,  that's the fact,  but what I do care about  is people making excuses  why the fat and all that.  It's a decision  that people make  and it's not an easy one  to eat right  and to exercise  and all that.  Look,  really fast  because yesterday  I went out to Long Island  for my nephew's birthday.  JD celebrating 
[01:04:00]  his big 1-0,  10 years old,  right?  There were so many  freaking treats  at my sister's house.  I was going out  of my mind  saying no.  Finally broke down  and had a couple,  just a couple  chocolate chip cookies.  That's it.  Could have had the cake,  could have had everything else  that was out  on that picnic table.  I guess what?  It was killing me  but I said no.  I broke down  and had a couple cookies.  That was it.  It's been literally  almost a year now  since I've been  to any fast food places  like McDonald's 
[01:04:30]  or anything like that  and to a point,  you guys are right.  A lot of the food  that they do serve  in America  is really unhealthy.  How much do you lose?  You said 40?  Oh, 40?  I lost about 40 pounds  so far  and I'm at a plateau  but I'm still  kicking in there.  I'm eating sushi  like five or six times  a week.  I'm like,  is that healthy though?  A lot of it?  No.  I eat a lot of sushi.  Watch out for that  mercury, man.  I eat a lot of sushi.  That mercury is a common.  They call me  the sushi kid. 
[01:05:00]  I'll be coming in  on Friday  if you guys are  doing the same show  from the same studio  but you know.  Yeah, we'll be there.  Yeah, of course, man.  We like the live studio  audience on Friday.  We love it.  Thanks, Sonny.  See you, buddy.  Look how old he knows  it's not easy.  Certainly.  Especially when you're older.  It's hard to lose weight  when you're over 35.  The last 10 pounds  is the hardest solution.  Oh, gosh.  Good gravy, isn't it?  What if you only  try to lose eight?  Someone is making fun of me  because I walk home  every day. 
[01:05:30]  No, it's actually  we did a little  Google thing yesterday  and it's about  a mile and a half.  So I'm knocking down  a mile and a half  four to five days a week.  That's right.  There's always a way  to kind of like  get your heart a-pump in.  Absolutely.  Bonnie had a baby  and is skinnier now  than before she had the baby.  Yeah.  For the truck drivers.  That's why she still  lives at home with me.  For the truck drivers,  you're stopping somewhere  and you just run in place  for 10 minutes.  Dude, do something.  Walk around the parking lot.  Look at the lounge lizards.  Exactly.  Do something. 
[01:06:00]  Go drilling  in the restroom.  Go drill little holes  in there for your friends  even if you're not  going to use the glory holes.  Don't use a power drill  though.  Use one of those  old-time ones  to work out the arms.  Then you work out  your neck muscles.  Halt, halt, halt.  Then you stand up  and you work out  your hips.  Like a real aerobic workout.  Work out the glutes.  Squeeze, clench,  clench release.  If you do that enough times  you won't have to work out  at all.  The weight will just peel off.  The weight will be  falling off of you. 
[01:06:30]  What a shock  that the bit goes there.  Of course it does.  Why not though?  Why not?  Glory holes and AIDS.  Yeah.  That's the name  of my next book.  I'm fat.  It's a medical problem.  Oh, it's not.  Maybe this person  has a point.  A medical problem.  I have the thyroid.  Jennifer.  Hello.  Hi, dear.  How old are you?  32.  God love you.  How big a gal?  About 180.  4 for 11. 
[01:07:00]  How tall?  4 for 11.  Okay, so what do you eat?  Now tell the truth, sweetie.  Jimmy, come on.  I love you.  I love you too.  What do you eat?  Well, no.  I eat salads.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  What do you eat?  A cookie salad?  I listen to you guys  every morning  and I sit to myself  they are going to rag on you.  All right.  How old are you?  Sweetheart,  you're basically a square.  You're the same height  and length.  You're really close 
[01:07:30]  to if we pushed you,  you would roll down a hill.  No, that's honestly true.  Are you eating the croutons?  I'm the boobs.  Are you eating the croutons?  Are you using  all the salad dressing?  Like, I love the people  that go,  look, I'm eating salads  and I don't understand.  Look at what's in the salad.  I just said that.  Did you say that?  Yeah, the Russian dressing,  Dows and Isle,  it's all fattening.  Those croutons  are just soaked in oil.  It's pure.  If you want to save  a few calories  if you're eating a salad,  just get rid of the croutons  and that'll help you 
[01:08:00]  a little bit.  And instead of the salad dressing,  do what I do.  I have fat-free milk.  I pour it over.  No, you're supposed  to dip the fork  in your salad dressing.  I actually do do that.  You know, funny,  you should say that.  Oh, my God.  You don't get enough dressing.  Of course you don't.  I mean, you know.  All right, Jennifer,  what do you eat?  No, I do.  I eat salads.  I eat fruit.  I eat beef.  I eat tuna fish.  But, you know,  like you said,  my metabolism doesn't...  All right, hold on a minute.  You eat tuna fish.  I can help everyone out here.  You eat tuna fish.  You're making the tuna fish 
[01:08:30]  with the mayo?  With the mayonnaise.  Well, yeah, but I don't...  Ah, there you go.  These dummies  don't understand.  Fat alert.  Tuna's healthy.  My dad,  at the end of his life,  he's like,  you know,  we used to yell and scream at him  to eat better  because he had all sorts  of heart problems.  He's like,  I eat chicken wings.  Chicken's healthy.  No, it's not.  The chicken part is,  but not the skin  and everything else  they do with it.  You could eat tuna  with yogurt.  I buy skinless chicken  and I bake it.  Jennifer,  tuna with mayo.  You know how fattening mayo is?  Use fat-free mayo. 
[01:09:00]  12 grams a teaspoon.  How about fattening?  And the tuna itself  is very fattening  because they,  for the most part,  they put...  I'm sure you're not  getting the water tuna.  No, yeah, I do  because I don't like the oil.  That's nasty.  Don't get it in there.  I'll get it in water.  Get it in water  and maybe just a little dash of mayo.  A little dash.  A little dash.  So it sticks together.  I understand that.  So it doesn't fall off the bread  as you take a bite.  Fat-free mayo.  I've tried that before.  It sucks.  Fat-free mayo is good.  Yeah, it is.  Or you could do it with yogurt.  No one eats yogurt  in tuna.  Yeah, they do.  I'm telling you.  No, they don't. 
[01:09:30]  That yogurt spread crap.  I don't know.  Bonnie does it.  I wouldn't try it.  I'm just saying.  It's Canadian.  It's weird.  That's weird.  It's Canadian?  It's weird.  I just wanted to call in  and give my little two cents  and listen to you guys  every morning.  Nothing's little about you.  Oh.  I knew you guys  were going to die on me.  Wait, hold on now.  We have to  because you're a 180, 411.  I mean, let's just say  closer to 200.  Come on.  Let's be honest.  Yeah, no one gives  their real weight, so  you've got to be...  No, no.  No, I'm close to 200.  I just went to the doctor  two months ago.  Okay. 
[01:10:00]  So you can't just be  eating salads.  It doesn't make sense.  No, because of the thyroid.  My metabolism doesn't work.  The thyroid.  What do you eat  that's unhealthy?  You have to cheat  once in a while  every three seconds.  What do you...  Well, yeah.  No, every time I cheat  every once in a while.  Right.  No, I don't sit  and eat junk food  and junk food  like 24 hours a day.  You're right.  Everyone does cheat  once in a while,  but everyone doesn't  have the height-to-weight  proportion of Jupiter.  What do you cheat with?  What do you cheat with? 
[01:10:30]  I don't know.  Yes, you do.  What's in front of you  right now?  Shut the fuck up,  Rich Voss.  Please.  All right, sorry.  No, what's in front of me  is my steering wheel  because I just pulled  into work.  What?  What's in front of me  is my steering wheel  because I just pulled  into work.  Oh, yeah?  No, Jimmy asked  a good question  that Rich just pounced on.  What do you cheat with?  No, I say every once in a while  like I do have fried chicken.  You know, I mean,  even if I do have  a couple of cookies, 
[01:11:00]  I don't eat the whole bag.  Oh, wow.  You know you're really cheating  when you consider it a victory  to not eat the whole bag.  Yeah, you shouldn't  have any cookies.  I don't use my tongue  like an anteater  and actually lick the crumbs  out of the bottom.  I don't buy cookies  because guess what?  I don't have the willpower.  Eat them.  If they're in the house,  I'm going to eat them.  Remember I said yesterday  JD's birthday party  had two chocolate chip cookies  because they were freshly baked  and stuff  and then there was  a bit of guilt.  Before yesterday, 
[01:11:30]  I swear to you,  I couldn't tell you  the last time  I had a lousy cookie.  I just couldn't tell you.  Yeah.  There's no such thing  as a lousy cookie.  Give me those ribs.  Oh, come on now.  Well, here's what I'm saying.  Jimmy asked her,  what do you eat?  And she said,  I don't know.  And I said,  look in front of you.  So I really didn't  step on his question.  That was a good response.  I didn't deserve  to get yelled.  Earlier I did,  I did step on.  All right, my fault, right?  That one I didn't deserve.  I'm sorry, Rich.  No, and I'm sorry earlier  for stepping on.  You're 51. 
[01:12:00]  I know.  Just relax.  Everyone loves you.  I don't like getting yelled at.  I don't blame you.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I was out of line, Rich.  I'm really sorry.  That really hit you  where you live, didn't it?  What's that?  That really hurt you.  Well, no,  it just reminds me of  as a kid growing up.  Getting screamed at.  Yeah, for when you didn't do stuff.  You know, you get screamed at.  It was horrible.  Yeah, Voss is a sweet guy.  Voss's feelings  are a little hurt right now.  They are, yeah.  It's true.  Rich, I'm sorry.  Well, that's okay.  I'm a bit on edge.  I apologize.  No, but I started off too fast today.  I did jump out of the gate 
[01:12:30]  a little too fast  and I have to slow down.  The whole show is a little on edge.  We have a big day today  and it's like none of us  handle pressure well.  Uh-huh.  We just don't.  So that's...  All right, guys.  I'm punching out.  I gotta go to work.  I love you guys.  Thank you for ragging on me.  No, we weren't that bad to you, sweetie.  Considering what your height and weight is,  we could have been harsher.  Yeah.  All right.  You probably could have  and I was expecting it.  I'm kidding, sweetheart.  The fried chicken...  Rich, shut up!  She's got to go to work.  You got to stop eating  the fried chicken.  Bye, guys.  Love you.  We're going to the beach Saturday. 
[01:13:00]  Can we play with you?  So the milking machine...  Does the milking machine  make you chafe at work?  I have to go to work.  They're walking us  through the Midtown Tunnel shortly.  There's no reason to do it.  All right, listen.  So, boss,  you don't like getting yelled at in life.  All right, I apologize.  No, no, no.  He apologized.  I feel bad now.  I'm going backwards here  to his childhood.  Not now.  But you would get yelled at  by, what, your dad?  Who would you get yelled at?  Uh, well, here's...  It was weird  because, like,  when your parents were divorced, 
[01:13:30]  uh, like, my father  would come over  every couple weeks,  but he would fit everything  in the visit.  You know, he'd come in the room,  he'd smack me,  yell at me,  and all that.  Then get lecture,  then take us out to eat  and give us money and leave.  So it was all, like, mixed...  Uh, what is that?  Mixed, uh...  Mixed messages.  Mixed messages.  But they would yell at me  and sit me down,  like, you know,  it's just, like,  all at once, you know,  because everybody yelled at me.  Making you feel stupid?  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  And they still yell at you.  My...  Everybody...  It's just...  I lived above my grandparents.  They would...  Everybody yelled.  Listen, we're...  We have to take a break,  but we certainly should continue  with this after the break.  Yeah, because I don't want  to see Voss hurt.  Also, we got the extreme  home makeover house  and foreclosure.  Also, um...  I guess I want to go back  to the days where  we didn't make excuses  for everything.  The medical community  is making up new diseases  every single day  at this point.  No.  As I'm sitting here  in the last 15 minutes,  I just saw three 
[01:14:30]  different drug commercials.  I saw the one,  and I'm like,  I wonder how many more  they're going to play  in this break alone.  There were three.  What's Plavix?  Oh, Plavix?  Is that cholesterol?  What is it?  Yeah, it's for cleaning  out the pipes.  Cleaning out the pipes?  I want to go back  to the day where  there weren't  as many diseases  because now they got  excuses for everything  that is wrong with you.  Everything.  I want to run  through the phones again  because we're going  to clear the lines.  Kristen Union,  I was fat my whole life.  Gastric bypass  is the way to go.  Wayne on Long Island, 
[01:15:00]  it's fun to be fat.  It's fun to be fat?  Yeah, why not?  Paul in Boston,  tired of people  making excuses  for themselves.  Rob in Cleveland,  they make fat people's  seats on roller coasters now.  Do they really?  I don't know.  John in Linden,  my problem is  I can't gain weight.  Jason in Arizona,  eating healthy  is so expensive.  Mike in Jersey,  metabolism is good  because you're in shape.  Rich from Plainfield,  I'm sad. 
[01:15:30]  Did you guys do the story  at the other place  about the family  that got on the water ride  and they were so fat  that they swamped it  at the bottom?  It happened last week  in an amusement park  and I think they're  suing them now.  If not,  we have the audio.  Oh, we have the audio?  Yeah, let's play that  after the break.  And no snitching policy  making cops life hard  because no one wants  to fess up to  what they know  in the community.  Protect everybody. 
[01:16:00]  Go ahead.  Protect all the thugs.  I think it's human nature.  You're not going to  let out your friends  for the most part ever.  I'm not talking about friends.  Just witnesses  sometimes see this stuff.  People are just afraid  of it getting back  to the perpetrators.  Yeah, probably.  Most of the people  don't want drug dealers  in their neighborhood  but then when you pipe up  and go,  could you stop,  they get shot.  It's true.  Okay.  It's easy for us to say.  Make a good point.  But you can't walk  to 30 thugs  on your corner  and go,  pipe down.  I have to get up  in the morning.  I have to work.  Yeah.  Sleep in the tub  and deal with it.  Vince from Bayonne, 
[01:16:30]  he writes,  stop the effing  touchy feeling  O&A show  talking about dieting.  Opie whining  about cookies  and Rick being  all PMS.  God damn it,  he's right.  We really are.  We're like giving  a healthy calorie count idea.  Oh.  Here's what you can do.  Have a salad.  Have a sunny day.  Just dip the fork  in the dressing.  We are boring queers.  We are boring queers.  Yeah,  but this is all started  because we want Sam  to do  Why Are You Eating That? 
[01:17:00]  I think that would be  a great bit.  Why are you eating that?  Coming soon  to the Opie and Anthony show.  He should ask us that.  It should be bullets.  Opie and Anthony.  We're retarded,  retarded people.  You know,  broken down people.  And then the audience  is just the fucking drooling  mongoloids  that are chained to the wall  that can't even raise  their hand up.  They need to fucking listen.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony 
[01:17:30]  starring Jim Norton.  Rich Voss is here today.  Rich,  are you going to accept  my apology?  Oh yeah,  I said there was no problem there.  We're a bit on edge.  We're talking to the guy  that fired us  six years ago  for the first time  in six years today.  Wow.  Oh.  Yeah.  We haven't talked to him  since the big day  back in 2002  so we're a bit on edge here.  So please accept my apology.  I don't even mind 
[01:18:00]  and sometimes  earlier today  I deserve to be on that  and I do accept it  and I make a mistake.  Just accept the apology.  Just accept the apology.  Oh my God.  Don't need to flog yourself  like it's a religious sermon.  Did I say your baby's  one of the cutest babies  I've ever seen, right?  Okay.  Did I say how beautiful  your place was?  Shh.  Oh, the two of you  see it's a love fest.  Didn't I tell you  you look like you lost weight?  I want them to think  I live in a hall.  Oh.  Then just start dressing 
[01:18:30]  like Anthony.  I had the greatest upgrade  in history  as far as living quarters go.  I went from a mouse  infested joint  with black mold  and cockroaches  to a little bit better  than that.  A little bit.  A little bit.  So are you nervous  about our day today?  Not really actually.  Good.  I just was trying  to come up with an excuse  why I'm in a hole today.  Hey, we got a house  Extreme Home Makeover.  You watch this show there, Rich?  It's one of my favorite shows  and I 
[01:19:00]  I shed a tear  every once in a while.  Me and Robert Kelly.  We get a little emotional  when we watch  this Extreme Home Makeover show.  Hysterical.  Start weeping about it.  Oh, they got a house!  Not full out crying  but there's a gulp  of possible  moisture issue  happening in the eyeballs  where you have to  kind of look away  because your  extremely cool chick  is sitting there  just waiting for you  to maybe drop a tear  so she can make fun of you.  Yeah.  I can't watch the show. 
[01:19:30]  I just point  and go  you bums.  Yeah.  You freeloaders.  You got these  families.  It used to be cool  when it was just  regular families  down on their luck  but now they have to  get the families  with the kid  that has like  a disease  that only one other  person in the world has.  Yeah, they got to  put that feature in.  You know,  we bring it up  all the time  but can't go outside.  Dude, the chick  the girl  that can't get hot  or she'll die  so everyone has to  freeze to death  in this house 
[01:20:00]  and they got like  special like  AC units  that are like  just sucking energy  out of the entire town  just to keep her cool  and then the brother  feels guilty  so he doesn't go outside.  He's quote normal  but he doesn't go outside  because his poor little sister  has to stay cool  and then she wears  like this vest  that has ice packs  in it  to try to keep her body  kept in her cool  and you're sitting there  just bawling at home.  Another vacation in Iceland  Oh, I just  I don't have it today.  No. 
[01:20:30]  Is that true?  That was good  because Iceland's cold.  You know what though, Rich?  What?  You sort of make a good point  because I think this family  lived in Arizona  so you're saying to yourself  well, if your kid  has like a temperature problem  why wouldn't you go  to maybe  maybe an area  that is a bit  colder year round?  Or just continually  slap them  and yell  stop sweating.  That's the way  to handle that.  Dude, it gets so cold  in their house  maybe some of the  people that watch  this show  can help me out  but it gets so cold  in the house  they got to keep  the AC so low  that the rest of the family 
[01:21:00]  walks around  with like gloves on  because it's not  just normal AC  like alright  let's get it down  to 72  is 72 about right?  Yeah.  It's way below 72  to try to keep this  68  to try to keep  this thing cool.  My carbon footprint  is pretty huge.  I keep my AC  at 68  in the bedroom  and then I pile  covers on me  to keep warm.  Why would I do that?  Why not just use  less covers  and keep the air  conditioning up 
[01:21:30]  a little higher  but you can't  I don't know  why I do that.  Well my stupid guilt  from how I was brought up  I feel guilty  turning on AC.  What?  Yeah, I'm just a mess.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding.  And I turn lights off  all the time  in my house.  I can afford  electricity and AC  but how I was raised  yeah, I feel guilty  turning the AC on.  Yes, I do.  What are you saving up  to be, Jewish?  Wait, you don't use AC?  I do  but then, you know  I'm constantly  turning it off  from room to room  to room  Why?  I open up the windows 
[01:22:00]  when I can  Oh, wow.  It's a guilt thing.  That bad air coming in  that bad air  from outside  to New York City air.  I understand.  You contradicted yourself  you said I was brought up  that way  to turn off  but a person  that a kid  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on  I'm sorry  you're right Rich  I never had AC  growing up  we had  this is how cheap  my stupid family was  we had one fan  that we rotated  we took turns  using one fan  That to me  would make me think  like if you then  have the opportunity  you'd just use it  I know  You're right  Blast it 
[01:22:30]  My house is a meat locker  It's just a freezer  My mom was obsessed  with the fact  that we were going  to be destitute  and on the street  and so  the cost cutting  in my house  was unbelievable  how ridiculous it was  Wow  Ridiculous  I didn't know AC  until  not even in college  obviously  so I was out of college  when I really understood  what AC was all about  I would go to a friend's house  and they would have it  every once in a while  Yeah, sure  But how can you be poor 
[01:23:00]  and live in a house  I don't understand  We were poor  and we lived for free  in an apartment  Ask my mom that  But if you're in a house  you can't be poor  We had a big house  too, Rich  I don't know  I don't get it  We used to sweat, man  We'd have the sweat stains  in our sheets  We would sweat so much  in the summer  You'd have to go  share a fan  like what, Monday  your brothers get it  Tuesday  It would go like  I've blocked out  a lot of memories  from growing up  but something like that  Yeah, it was like  we just kind of took turns  using the one fan  and I think we splurged 
[01:23:30]  and got a second one  finally  Thanks  What is it?  We had seven kids  and then whoever else  was living in the house  at the time  that we didn't know  Is your monthly electric bill  like reasonable?  No, it's over a thousand  A month?  Yeah  A month?  I think so, yeah  It's crazy  Mine isn't even that  Mine isn't even that  But it's Con Ed  I don't know how much it is  I don't really know  I just signed checks  I pay four grand a month  in energy  I know my electric bill 
[01:24:00]  is probably about  490 a month  Honestly, I think  mine's a little over 500  That's not  Couldn't be more  I know, I've seen your house  No way, I leave all the lights on  I have the air conditioning cranking  I understand  I'm a maniac  I have an iron lung  in my living room  Yes, just in case  I don't know  Yeah, just in case  a quadriplegia comes over  and wants to breathe  I'm like, I had to lay in there  for a while  to watch the kid  Just a little mirror  I don't  This is what's so weird though  I don't pay attention  to the actual bills 
[01:24:30]  Yeah  But it's still ingrained  in my head  like to feel a little guilt  to take care of yourself  and put the AC on  or to keep all the lights on  at night  so I'm constantly  turning off lights  and if I don't really need it  I'll turn the AC off  But when it comes to paying bills  I have no idea  what my monthly bills are  I told Anthony this  and I swear to God  I have no idea  how much money I make  I bet it's in the twos  And I don't want to know  Your electric bill  I mean  I bet it's in the twos  You're probably pretty good  when it comes to  shutting lights off  and stuff  No, it's higher than that 
[01:25:00]  I'll tell you tomorrow  I have what amounts  to probably  two runway landing lights  that shine on my house  for no other reason  than so when people drive by  they could go  wow, look  Let's rob him  There's no reason  Give it a whirl, mother  Give it a whirl  Come on in  How come the electric company  you can't choose  You have no choice  You have to take that electric  It's not like you  You don't have to  You can't shop around  You can set up a generator  in your backyard  and pedal it  What are you going to do?  You can't shop around, right? 
[01:25:30]  You can shop around  It's not easy  but you can get some  alternative energy going  You can actually build  a windmill or something  There's actually an over and over  like you go online  and order energy  and they send you a box of it  A box of energy  You open it up  and electricity spills out  into your living room  and then you just hold  your appliances over it  How else are you going to get  electricity?  Alright, so we go back  to extreme makeover, right?  Home makeover?  Yeah  Well, listen to this  This is a great story today  You watched it happen  on Channel 2  An army of volunteers  swarmed a Clayton County neighborhood 
[01:26:00]  to build a new home  for a deserving family  When the extreme makeover  home addition came to town  no one could have predicted  what would happen  less than four years later  Foreclosure  Foreclosure  Foreclosure  We joke about these houses  being built  and then, you know  they leave  and these houses  are in horrible neighborhoods  and the family spends  you know  most of their  most of their  most of their day  like just  like guarding their house  Yeah  Yeah  Having to  keep the riffraff out 
[01:26:30]  They don't go away  on weekends  They never take a vacation  because they don't  trust their neighbors  No  They're in a bad neighborhood  That's why they needed  a new house  You ever see  like I think  Where was it?  It was in  Camden, New Jersey  They built a ridiculous house  and I'm not kidding  a ghetto  Yeah  And they even like  kind of panned the street  It was like  awful house  awful house  awful house  holy S house  awful house  awful house  What do you think  is happening 
[01:27:00]  when the lights  go out at night?  Yeah  The zombies  The zombies are coming out  just waiting for their chance  to attack  and get whatever the hell  they can from that house  Yep  Alright, more about the foreclosure  This involves  Wow  Lake City's  extreme makeover house  Leonard Raglan  my photographer  is going to zoom in  into two important things  First of all, May 9th  that's when they took out a loan  for $450,000  There you see it  Now that loan is in default  Oops  The family got the home  for free in 2005  cashed in equity 
[01:27:30]  and then got in too deep  Patricia Harper told us  she and her husband  had struck a deal  with Chase Home Finance  to rescue their extreme home  A foreclosure notice  appeared last Friday  A $450,000 second mortgage  they took out less than  15 months ago  was in default  Ah, it's their own fault  right?  Yeah  This isn't like  oh, these poor guys  this poor family  they took out a loan  against their house  and they defaulted on the loan  Because a lot of these families  not only do they give them 
[01:28:00]  a brand new mansion  basically  they also find  some mortgage company  that pays their mortgage for them  Yeah  So what's their expenses really?  The local taxes?  Yeah, I guess so  What'd they take out  that kind of money for?  I heard to start a business  some kind of construction business  that failed miserably  and uh  They didn't take it out  to waste it though  they just  I don't know  I'm asking  You know  it's pretty god damn risky  if you look at the overall scheme  to sacrifice your house  to kind of gamble 
[01:28:30]  on a business like that  Get yourself a god damn job  and relax for a little bit  Can't they just declare bankruptcy  and stay there  the way uh  I don't know  I don't know  They probably didn't plan ahead  very well  and they gambled their house away  on uh  a chance uh  to start a business  Yeah  You can't declare bankruptcy  if you have equity  to pay the loan back  which the house is doing  Are you kidding me?  How many millionaires  claim bankruptcy  all the time  they do it to get away 
[01:29:00]  from the debtor  Well there's new laws now  with the bankruptcy laws  They always find ways  What's the new bankruptcy law?  Rich Foss  that you have to prove  that you don't have  the equity  the equity to cover  the money you're trying  to get away with  You probably right  You probably right  You have to prove  you don't have the equity  to cover  the loans you're defaulting on  Yes  You said it like  a complete dummy  but you're right  But that might not even be the law  I just said that  Yeah you just said it  It took a long time  but I gotta tell you  I finally figured out 
[01:29:30]  Rich Foss' weakness  He's always good  He's above the neck  Yeah but he's always good  until you ask  the follow up question  Yeah  You hit him with a second question  and it's overjotted  Then he has no clue  He'll get away with the first one  but if you ask him  any question  that has anything to do  with what he just stated  Equity  You just watch  the wheels fall off  He has like five  like catch thoughts  Yeah  that he'll throw out there  and his hand gets  parental responsibility  What should the parents do?  Ah, equity  Equity  Maybe I just read the headline 
[01:30:00]  and I don't read the story  Yeah maybe that's it  He reads the headline  he looks at the picture  and he forms an opinion  and then he runs it  until you chat about it  Alright here we go  More on the foreclosure  Lake City Mayor  Willie Oswalt  was among 1,800 volunteers  helping Extreme Makeover Home Edition  build the Harper's New Home  That was three and a half years ago  These Are Homes of Atlanta  was the main sponsor  The Mayor is baffled  Beezer gave them  $100,000  Cash? 
[01:30:30]  Paid their  paid their mortgage  y'all  and still can't make it  Mrs. Harper told us  they invested the loan proceeds  ironically  in a construction business  and business hasn't been good  Couldn't you start  with a smaller business?  Yeah, like bagels  or something  A hot dog  perhaps a lemonade stand  out in front of the free house  In front of the free house  Yeah  Right  Dummies  So that's it  Look at that house 
[01:31:00]  It's gone  Who wouldn't want to live  in that thing?  That's a nice house  That's it  Homeless  Almighty  Dummies  and the volunteers  are so mad  Yeah  They just lost it  trying to cash in  How much do they owe  on a $450,000 loan?  Like how does that  They're $10, $20  They probably own  They probably own  most of it  I mean owe most of it  Do they all work?  If they're not paying  a mortgage  why can't they pay off  the loan?  So many questions  from me 
[01:31:30]  from people who don't know  Yeah, how does that work?  I guess the mortgage company  that was paying the loan  doesn't want to sit there  while they default  on a home equity loan  still pay into it  I don't understand  when a house is built  like when the TV show  comes in and builds  that house  isn't it already paid for?  Why is there  a mortgage company involved?  I mean all the material  and everything  No, but isn't the house  Holy Jesus  Wait, wait a second  Whoa  Why isn't this  Yeah, stand up  Why isn't this  Isn't that 
[01:32:00]  It's like somebody saying  I'm going to give you a car  but there's still  somebody paying  there's still a bank  that's paying off your car  Whoever built the house  put the money up  for the house  So why is our mortgage company  involved in this?  Do you understand  what I'm saying?  But Rich has really smart thoughts  that have to come out  through a dumb filter  No  Anthony can figure  Anthony, you can explain this  What?  Why?  There's a mortgage on that  What do you think?  What do you think?  What?  Because it's TV  they're like  here, here's a house for you 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, that house is paid for  It's built  What do you think  it's built with?  Magic things  that don't cost anything?  No, everything  is paid for  It's paid for by who?  Well, one  Do you think the brick company  that put all that  fronted all the money  and just went over there  and used all the money?  The TV show is paying for it  aren't they?  Watson's saying that  he thinks that the house  has been paid for in full  like if they say  the brick company  adds up to $450,000  he thinks that ABC  hands over a $450,000 check 
[01:33:00]  Oh, do you think  that's what happens?  Yeah, they're paying for the house  Big deal  They have a TV show  and they get a bunch of people  to put together your house for you  Big deal  You're not getting a free house  and if there's a mortgage company involved  But maybe the mortgage company  is being paid by  you know  not the people  I don't know  whatever you have  I'm trying to explain it  to this  They can't  It's a legitimate question  It's a legitimate  Explain it to him  as if he was a child  Not only that 
[01:33:30]  They get a mortgage  They get a mortgage company  that they do a little charity  and they give a free mortgage  to these families  But the mortgage company  is still paying  Yeah  What I'm saying is  a network  Okay  Wow  You just weren't listening before  They took out a mortgage  against the house  to start the construction business  If they never took the second  That's where the mortgage comes from  If they never took the second mortgage  Second mortgage  No, there was no first mortgage  Yeah, if they never took out  the second mortgage  they wouldn't be in the position 
[01:34:00]  Well, they didn't take out a mortgage  they took out a loan  on their house  Yeah, which is a mortgage  because you put the house up  as collateral against the loan  That's the basis of that loan  That's the whole collateral  So that  The house had no mortgage  Oh, okay  They got the house  They came in and said  Let's start a construction business  We got almost a half million in equity  And they got a mortgage company  to give them the money  That's how that basically works  So they had a mortgage  because  they wanted to start  this construction company  And they defaulted on it  So now  the mortgage company  is going to own the house  If they would have went to the bank 
[01:34:30]  and took a loan  against their house  at the bank  would they have not lost a house?  Where do you think they went  to get the loan?  That's the same thing  Where do you think they went?  Oh my god  There's a mortgage company  on the bank  Wait a second  That's where you went  to a bank  Hold on  If they went to a bank  Listen to me  If they went to Starbucks  He's standing up again  I'm half a mil  You think mortgage companies  You think every bank  Mortgage companies  There's mortgage companies  that are separate from banks  Okay  They went to a  And banks  Would you default on the house? 
[01:35:00]  That's what I asked  If they borrowed the money  from a bank  instead of a mortgage company  A bank would have said  Hey don't worry about it  We got it  What are you talking about?  It was Chase  It was Chase Mortgage  Right?  That was in the story  Chase is part of what?  J.P. Morgan Chase  Which is what?  A bank  Part of a large financial institution  Voss  Where did you grow up?  Antarctica  Voss is a moron  Voss's head should be used  as a doorstop  They don't get it  They just don't understand  I'm a homeowner  Well you're something  that sounds like that  God 
[01:35:30]  You might be a homeowner  He's probably paying  four mortgages  and he has no idea  He took out four loans  on the same house  No  What's your interest rate there Rich?  I know  Everyone knows their interest rate  Very high  I'm interested in my house  It's  See  You know here's the thing  I might come off  I think it's 4.6 or 4.5  Or maybe 5.3  4  No it's 4  No wait  It's 5  It's 5 and 3 quarters

[01:44:00]  and texters get ready  You got another chance  to win a key  that might start  that fine car  from allamericanford.net  But first this  The History Channel  and Jimmy Dean's  Sausage Links  with a grant  from the Picket Fence  Dental Corporation  present  20th Century  American History  with renowned scholar  and member of Mensa  Rich Voss  I know  I know a lot about it  Dr. Voss  will take you  on a breathtaking journey  through history's  most poignant milestones  What event took the world  to the brink of  World War III  in 1962 
[01:44:30]  The Bay of Pigs  in Cuba  Oh my God  Oh no  the Russian Missile Crisis  Oh my God  With every outburst  Rich Voss  gets dumber and dumber  In 1962  what almost brought us  to World War III  it had to be  the Bay of Pigs  in Cuba  when  No  it's not the Bay of Pigs  Your head will spin  It was the U.S. president  when World War II ended  The war ended  with the dropping  of the atomic bombs  That didn't actually  end World War II 
[01:45:00]  You've never met a Jew  who knows less  about World War II  than Rich Voss  What was the World War  where Germany  was going and  taking  you know  just out of control  By the way  I've never wanted  to punch someone  more than you  Are you talking to me?  Yes  It's pretty embarrassing  when you think about it  So tune in  to 20th century  American history  and watch an amazement  as an old Jewish man  goes from mildly coherent  to babbling pile of mush  in the course of an hour  You know  you know  it's all history from 
[01:45:30]  coming to the History Channel  These guys  they can do whatever  they want to do  This is why people  are tuning in  to hear Opie and Anthony  And this is where  things get  ridiculous  I need to be a shock jock  Always up to no good  Be a man  I laughed so hard  I had to fucking myself  out of my couch  It's the Opie and Anthony show  And this is like  the number one show  in the world  It's the Opie and Anthony show

[01:47:00]  The caller went away  but they wanted  they want to talk about  your three acre house  Three acre  A lot of phone calls  came in  You gave the footage  of your house  in such a way  that it would make it  like a three acre house  How did I do that?  Travis come on in here  Travis will explain  Yes  Go ahead Travis  Well Rich  I believe you said  that your house  is twelve hundred 
[01:47:30]  by one hundred  Yes  No  You did say that  at one point  No I said  twelve hundred square feet  which would be  You did at one point  say twelve hundred  by one hundred  The fifty people  who called in  at the same time  seemed to disagree with you  Yeah  So maybe we can  pull the audio  Oh well it doesn't  really matter  I mean I know  it's you know  twelve hundred  square feet  and I said  when we were  talking about  a kitchen being  twelve hundred  square feet  I probably  I still said  twelve hundred  by a hundred  but it was  I meant  a hundred  and twenty  by a hundred  it's twelve  hundred square feet  right  Yeah  Yes it is 
[01:48:00]  I have no idea  what you're talking about  No it's not  Twelve by a hundred  What you just gave  would be twelve  thousand square feet  Oh yeah  that's what I meant  But you said  a hundred and twenty  by a hundred  This rich lives  in a house  the size of  a football field  All right  Well  Oh we forgot  to talk about  poor Jerry Lewis  Poor Jerry Lewis  Not knowing  he had a gun  in his luggage  Oops  Oopsie  Whoops  I do not know

Yeah you get  to the airport  you don't realize  you just stick  your underwear  on top  and you leave  one shell casing 
[01:50:30]  or something  in there  and oh boy  you're getting  dragged offline  checking parts  of you  Wow  By the way  the word is  predizone  or pred  Pregnizone?  I don't know  if it's  Pregnizone  That is one  of the steroids  they use  and I guess  all steroids  blew you up  but Jerry's  people were saying  it was a prop gun  that wasn't capable  of firing  and the police said  we would not  have charged him  if it were  a prop gun  probably couldn't  take a prop gun 
[01:51:00]  either  but  it's a prop gun  a fully working  prop gun  What's he working  with propellers on it?  Are you robo  what is it called?  No  Robo tripping  Robo tripping  no  I'm trying to get  off the drugs  so I didn't take  any robo-tussin  today  so I'm hacking  a little bit  but  what are you going to do?  Alright  The Today Show  Wow  they did some  terrific TV today  What they did? 
[01:51:30]  Well they had  Al Roker  that is looking  more and more  like a turtle  outside his shelf  every day  I don't know  what's going on  with him  but he's got  a weird look  going on  I guess they  were playing  rock band  on The Today Show  this morning  Oh were they?  That's funny  because people  like Meredith Vieira  and Matt Lauer  they wouldn't be  playing rock band  so  that must have  been fun to watch  and you know  they're right at  the cutting edge  of things  like the rock band  craze  which is  you know 
[01:52:00]  a little old now  I mean Phil  is still playing  and stuff  but it's not  one of those  things you jump  on like  it's something  new  but I'm sure  they just heard  of it  Is everybody ready?  Ready!  Let's rock New York!  Let's do it!  What kind of time  Not so long ago  Look we have an excuse 
[01:52:30]  we're a dopey radio  Wow  This is network TV  We're supposed to be dopey  and not well polished  They're number one  They're number one with this crap?  No one likes that  when it's like  at a karaoke bar  when people get up there  and start just screaming  with their drunken  girlfriends and stuff  Why would you want  to watch that on TV?  They think that by embracing  their awfulness  that they're being cute  and fine  Exactly  And you're not 
[01:53:00]  You suck  Oh yeah  Do you know  I've been down  all day  Working for a man  to bring home  to pay for them  She said we gotta hold on  to what we've got  It doesn't make a difference  if you think it or not 
[01:53:30]  We got each other  and that's a lot  for love  Give it a shout  I don't have words  Well you wanna hear  gunshots right now  Yeah  Where's Jerry Lewis  and his gun  Mow him down  Alice saying  cut my stomach  I'll quit eating  I swear  That creep  Doesn't end 
[01:54:00]  We really wanna keep  going with this  Yeah  Willard Scott's down  in Washington  He's got a check  at the first time  My Uncle Bill  has a steal on  the hill  where he runs off  a gallon or two  Governor Huckabee  eat your heart out  Hey that's beautiful music  but not to your ears  See they have to understand  that it's not charming  No  They're trying to be charming  Like look at how nutty we are  People go  Ah look at that 
[01:54:30]  They're charming friends  It's not charming  No they're not  It stinks  Wow  That's unlistenable  Yeah  I like Matt Lauer though  I don't wanna like Matt Lauer  Why do you like Matt Lauer?  Cause he went after  Cause he goes after people  He's glib  He is but  Matt Lauer's glib  But he wasn't afraid  He stuck at the stupid Tom Cruise  That's what he said  He didn't back off  an ounce  on Tom Cruise  He showed off on MTV  like a VJ or something  He called our  wow promotion  stupid though  On Leno  Well it's cause they  We got that clip  Showed their breasts  We got the Matt Lauer 
[01:55:00]  wow clip  Cause Susie Greenberg  Showed her breasts  Remember good old  Susie Greenberg  I do  There's a linger longer  And she showed her breasts  on live TV  So he had to make a comment  That was a huge one for us  It sure was  Cause he go after politicians  when he's interviewing them  Cause I don't watch them  So I can't  I haven't seen him interview any  But I don't know  Why do you have to try  to find an inconsistency  No I'm not  I'm just asking  Cause maybe I'll start  to like him  if he does that  I don't like or dislike him  It just helped form my opinion 
[01:55:30]  He had with somebody else too  Like some stupid celebrity  He went  It's easy to go after celebrities  but go after politicians  Do you see what you're doing right now?  What?  Do you see why you have  virtually your friend list  at your age?  First of all  it's not easy to go after celebrities  When you're in a show  based on booking them  and you have Tom Cruise  It's actually a lot harder  to go after celebrities  Tom Cruise is not an easy guy  to go after  The bottom line is  he's Tom Cruise  He didn't go after  a guy that  you know  the guy that played  the bartender in Cocktail  He went after Tom  Yes  And he called him out on it 
[01:56:00]  and he went back and forth  with him over a psychiatrist  Rich thinks like  if Matt Lauer  goes after a politician  all these other politicians  that were already booked  for the show  are going to be like  well now I can't go  on the Today Show  They don't get many politicians  Rich  But why don't I have any friends  that has nothing to do  with why  Because you're not a likable guy  Like here we are  I'm saying that  it's so great  that he went after Tom Cruise  he's got some balls  What's he doing politicians  Well I'm saying  because they're all  they're all phonies  Yeah they are  Do we have a cordless mic  because I do kind of  want to let Rich know  what I'm thinking 
[01:56:30]  what he's saying  but I can't do it right here  Oh  Alright  Well just take  just take that off  you got enough cord there  Yep  As Jimmy does his thing  I'm going to play this  We're following  a developing story alert  of the former  Hamilton County  morgue employee  is accused of having  sex with a corpse  It's a new chapter  in a mystery  dating back to  August of 1982  That's when  door-to-door salesman  David Stephan  Hold on  Jimmy what are you doing  Wait hold on  Somebody can help me 
[01:57:00]  No  Jimmy's  He needs help  desperately  And E-Rock comes over  E-Rock lumbers  He doesn't run  Anti-help  He just lumbers  Negative of help  I'm pulling the cord  E-Rock runs over  with his scissors  and cuts  Thank you  Alright  What are we doing  now Jimmy  Nothing  You guys do  what you do  I'm listening to  the show  in here  Alright  We're going to  replay this then  Listen to this story  Jimmy  We're following  a developing story  alert  of the former  Hamilton County  morgue employee  is accused of  having sex 
[01:57:30]  with a corpse  It's a new chapter  in a mystery  dating back to  August of 1982  That's when  door-to-door salesman  How is it a mystery?  Yeah  How is this a mystery?  The corpse was frowning  Wow  Tough room  Does he go after  a politician?  Forget it  Alright  That's when  door-to-door salesman  David Stephan 
[01:58:00]  killed 19-year-old  Karen Range  at a Rose Lawn home  He was sent to  Ohio's death row  Stephan confessed  to the murder  but denied  raping Range  That's where  former morgue worker  Kenneth Douglas  comes into the picture  Douglas was in  charge of checking  Range's body  into the morgue  and now stands  accused of  sexually abusing  her corpse  It wasn't until now  55-year-old Douglas  was arrested  on an unrelated  drug charge  in March  that a DNA sample 
[01:58:30]  was taken  and linked him  to the semen  in Range's body  He is now charged  with gross abuse  of a corpse  Having sex  with a corpse  is clinically  called necrophilia  It's considered  a mental disorder  that can be treated  but never cured  But never cured?  It doesn't matter  if you do it once  Yeah, yeah  It's one time  It can be treated  but never cured  Well, that's kind of  an odd thing to say  You never get over it  It's so good  you always want to 
[01:59:00]  do it again  Yeah, I guess so  How'd the guy  get caught?  The victim's not  talking, obviously  They need more  details  Wow  Well, I guess  he felt free  to kind of  do what he wanted  because there was  no risk of  anything happening  So he probably  left quite a bit  of evidence  In the hair  on the shoes  Jimmy, where are you?  In Bomb Town  Jimmy, we got  the Matt Lauer clip 
[01:59:30]  We haven't played  this in a while  I'm not a fan  of Matt Lauer  because he made fun  of our Wow promotion  Of course, whip him out Wednesday  That's what those  Wow stickers mean  on the highways  You know, guys  hoping to see some boobs  as they drive around  And there are women  out there that will  flash if they see  the Wow sticker  Simple as that  It's a great promotion  Matt Lauer didn't think so  How about the woman  that took her shirt off  in the line  Which I hear  you've had a little  We had a lot of fun  with it  Did that shock you?  You know what it was  We were outside  and if you've seen  the 8.30 in the show 
[02:00:00]  every morning  the camera pans  the crowd outside  and what I do  is since I can't see  where the camera is  sometimes  I look at the monitor  and I'm standing there  it happened to be  with Ann Curry  Katie was in Philadelphia  the time  and I'm looking at the monitor  and I see the people  go by  and normally  you know  Hi Mom  Hey Kansas  Go Jayhawks  and all of a sudden  the camera goes by  and this woman  looks at the camera  and goes  And my first thought  was it was one of those  kind of like  plastic pieces  that you wear on Halloween  you know  that they weren't real  They might have been  yeah  when you think about it  And then after like  45 seconds of staring at it  I said  you know  those are real 
[02:00:30]  and you know  she had written the word  wow  on her stomach  which apparently is  you know  W.O.W. stands for  the stupid radio station  promotion in New York  called Whip Them Out  Wednesdays  Thank you  Thanks for the promo  Why do you stop it there?  Well because then  Jayce you know  sticks up for us  and goes  well it's not that stupid  if you're talking about it  on a national show  Dummy  And so  she whipped him out  Well it's not a stupid  promotion anymore  They just got a lot  of publicity  I think it actually said 
[02:01:00]  powwow  but gravity had covered  the top word  That doesn't make sense  But what's weird about it  is think about this lady  at some point during her day  that day  she had to get in front  of a mirror  and say  yeah these are ready  for national television  and I gotta be honest  with you  speak as one boob man  Alright  So there you go  Jimmy  Yeah  You gonna stay in there  all day?  Well let's hope not  I'll tell you one thing  I'm working for not a lot  of payoff  It looks like a pinky 
[02:01:30]  Oh god  What the hell was that?  Alright Jimmy  we're gonna just end the show  with you in there  Why are you beating up  the toilet?  You might as well  I've been here  through most of the show  See?  Wow  I still say  how did they catch the guy 
[02:02:00]  and everyone's like  you weren't listening  DNA evidence  but they had to  be suspicious enough  Yeah  That's what I'm getting at  everybody out there  and it's a feedback line  Yes  I just have a question  about that story  because this is what hit me  when I was listening to it  Yeah  How hot was this girl?  Because this salesman  goes to the house  door to door salesman  his perv switch flips  says I have to have sex  with this girl  because one of the counts  was attempted rape  he didn't  but it was attempted  then the body gets  to the morgue  and the morgue worker's like  I have to have sex 
[02:02:30]  with this girl  Oh man  So I'm like  how hot was this girl?  Great digger  We definitely need more  on this story  But someone was suspicious  that's what I'm trying  to get to here  I think when they had  Because if you're talking  about DNA evidence  for the most part  you could hide  the DNA evidence  if you know  what I'm talking about  Yeah but then  the DNA evidence  as well  hit as it may be  could leak out  Yeah I'm sure  they could get it  You know  You ever watch CSI?  Good point  Jimmy? 
[02:03:00]  Yes  Just in time  to end the show  All good  All good  Although  some people would  think that we  ended the show  about 15 minutes ago  Yeah  We've been kind of  sputtering since 7-10  Rich Voss  Thank you so much Rich  Thanks  And I apologize again  We're just a bit edgy today  because  we're going to be  talking to Mel Carmers  in a few minutes  for the first time  in six years  That'll be cool  It'll be  Yeah it'll be fine  You think he knows me?

When he gets here  Marshall Simmons  didn't know you  Why would he know you?  He might know me  A lot of people watch TV 
[02:05:30]  I've been on a lot of TV  He would recognize you  if you were a big wig  down on Wall Street  He knows those guys  He doesn't see like faces  when it comes to celebrities  He ran Viacom  What's that?  Exactly  He's a company  What's that?  He's a dunce  And the place smells good  It looks good  Donnie Wicklund  They swabbed the deck  Donnie Wicklund's up here  in a suit  and Master Poe's up here  in a suit  Trying to keep their job 
[02:06:00]  I wouldn't be surprised  Poe makes him fill out  paperwork  I was just thinking  Ah, sir  Fill out your paperwork  and then take a seat  on the bleachers  Yes  We cleaned up the cockroaches  The place looks very good  I know the guys  worked hard on it  Wow, look at the sign  out there, huh?  Sirius XM  Look at that  Yeah  Who thought we'd ever  see the day  Did the deal go through?  Exactly  Do you understand  what's happening here?  Just hold on  Did the deal go through?  I mean, is it  We understand what you mean  Look at the sign 
[02:06:30]  Did they close  That's what I'm saying  No, no, they didn't  We're traders  We're actually  We're secretly shipping tapes  to Sirius  They're two separate companies  What are you  Well, I thought it was  going to take months  It took 18 months  It took  It took  a year and a half  Rich  Really?  No, I'm serious  I was reading  And this is Sirius XM radio  so you're in the right place  As of right now  Right now  As of yesterday  The day before  Right at the second 
[02:07:00]  the deal went through  Yes, they have signed  the paperwork  Can someone let us know  Wow  Can someone let us know  and say that  a certain boss  is on the elevator  so we can  make empty  a certain seat  Yeah  Thanks  Yeah  And I don't want it  I want it to be  done violently  If you could  humor me with that  Mars  Wow  You have to leave  I will  Maybe for a few  I'll go out  Yeah, you're just  too  What?  Stupid  to be in the same room 
[02:07:30]  No, but here's the thing  Rich  We love you  But you'll make  some kind of a joke  You'll say  You'll say something  that makes us  go  We really don't like him  Yeah, yeah  We'll have to defend ourselves  Exactly  Exactly  That's why we didn't  have an audience here  We're trying to  We're trying to  play this one right  No audience  No dummies  Just me  Anthony  And Jim Norton  He's going to be here  the whole time  Is he?  He'll probably do  an awkward 10 minutes  and get the fuck out  Well then I'll come back in  Alright, you can do that  Hey guys 
[02:08:00]  I'm going to leave now  I have something to do  Look, we don't care  what you do before or after  Yeah  We're not concerned  with your plans  It's the during part  Yeah  You know, when he's in here  you can't really be in here  You didn't even know  if the deal went through  You didn't know  what Viacom was  This is one for the adults, Rich  Listen, I'm serious  When it comes to this  kind of shit  I'm good at it  You're not good at it  At what?  Amscring?  Getting out?  Let's hope so  When it comes to meetings  and bigwigs  How many times  have you been told  to leave  Has Bonnie told you 
[02:08:30]  that at pitch meetings?  Like, you just shut up  You just don't talk  The last pitch meeting  we had last week  Perfect  Yeah  Yeah  That's great, Rich  So, and I'm good in here  That's what I'm saying  What I'm saying is  Because  As an adult  Oh, Cream Pie Jones  has to go too  Hide Cream Pie Jones  He can walk around  No  No  He shouldn't be seen  No  He shouldn't be seen  Uh-uh  See, I'm gonna tell you  why people like you guys  Why don't we line up  Why don't we line up  everybody and decide  if they should stay or go  Rich is so out  Rich is done  And Danny's got a hat on 
[02:09:00]  He's hiding the crazy hair  So you're good  We might have to tell Sam to go  Look at Sam  Sam's got  His hair's wacky  Although Mel does like hiring minorities  because he's got quotas to fill  So you stay  You stick around there, Sam  Okay  You're good  Mars, I think, should leave  Yeah, me too  You're not taking  Where's the nice shirt today?  Look at what Poe's wearing  Yeah  Yeah  You know what?  This is  This is  I've learned this in my career  many times  Career?  You guys  You guys 
[02:09:30]  are where you're at  because of who you are  You can't switch up  You can't  We're not switching up  Do you understand?  We're the same people  We just took a shower today  That's all we're doing  He thinks we're  He's saying  Don't sell out  because the boss is here  Right  That's what we have to deal with  I want to spill hot coffee  all over your little balls  That's what I'm mad about  Okay  And Mars has to be here  because what if something breaks  Who else will come in  and not fix it?  Oh, Jesus  Hey, before Mel gets here  I do want to say one thing  Bubba 
[02:10:00]  The love sponge  Yeah  Is calling us deal breakers  He basically said  that if O&A's part of the new company  that that is the deciding factor  for him to, I guess, leave satellite radio  Whatever  I think Bubba has a footprint in his ass  and he needs an excuse  like he's leaving on his own  A lot of people are saying that  Yeah, of course  He's making up his own excuse  because maybe the future isn't bright  for Bubba and satellite radio  Because I could give a crap  who works for the company 
[02:10:30]  Who cares?  It doesn't matter to me  I've worked for plenty of places  where I've liked and didn't like  some of the people that work there  What are you going to do?  It's a deal breaker  I refuse to work here  You don't even like the people  you do the show with  And that's not a deal breaker  A deal breaker  Yeah, he said  What was the quote?  It's on New York Radio Message Board  It's a deal breaker to him  Shut the fuck up  Nothing can break it  He's as dumb as they come  At least he talks  Stupid  At least he talks in his real voice 
[02:11:00]  Wow, it's a deal breaker  Wow, wow, wow  He really is horrible  He's the worst  He beat it  Back to Tampa, fat boy  Ow, ow, ow  Like he thought  there was going to be outrage  Like, okay, okay, Bubba  Okay, okay  We'll talk this out  Okay  Shut up  Don't you have to have  some kind of a deal  or power of negotiation  to have a deal breaker?  Like you can't walk in  if no one really cares  and goes, hey, that's a deal breaker  because then they'll just go  Okay  Broken 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, it's like somebody  that's just like  the greeter at a Walmart  walking up going  Sure  You know, I want this  and if you don't give it to me  it's a deal breaker  That's right  Either Frank gets fired  from receiving  or I quit  Yeah, yeah  It's not like  Okay, leave  Who cares?  No one go  Don't even announce it  Just leave  People will notice  You guys want to take  a quick break  get some leaks in  and all that stuff  and get Rich out of here  Want me to carry this  until you get back  and then I'll leave?  Carry it  Yeah, carry it 
[02:12:00]  I'll be right back  No one's going anywhere  Fuck it  I'm not saying anything  Don't say anything  I'm not bailing him out  What do you mean?  Don't say anything  I just got to take a leak  Yeah, we don't agree  Oh, okay  Well, you know  today is a very important day  After the merger  there's, you know  some big wigs come in  Big wigs come in  Now I have to  Don't talk  I don't want to  screw things up for me  If we do take some calls  you know  some intelligent ones today  keep the cursing  to a minimum  you know  and we'll get back to normal  in about a half an hour  Who's going to take calls 
[02:12:30]  Do you think we would  take a call?  Well, we're probably  not going to take calls  Insane  But what I'm saying is  Yeah, so now's your time  to, you know  go get some breakfast  do whatever  and call in later  Who, the audience?  We want the audience to listen  Oh  You're encouraging the audience  to go get breakfast?  Oh my God  You're not helping  You are really  We don't want any listeners  during this?  An abomination  Let me start over  Are we on the air?  Of course we are  Oh man  I'm going to  Sunnyvale  Sunnyvale next week  in California 
[02:13:00]  Rooster Teeth Feathers  So stop by  Hey, here's their  Rooster Teeth Feathers  Yeah, it's a club  It's a nice little club  You're performing  at a place called  Rooster Teeth Feathers  Oh really?  All of a sudden  your comedy club names  are original  or not crazy  or name, you know  big deal  they're all  whatever  Oh my God  is he just babbling  We should make him  do the Mel interview  We should all sit silently  and make him  Oh God  It would almost be worth  getting dumb for  Yeah  Just to watch the shame 
[02:13:30]  Yeah  that he feels  The dummy  Talking to a powerful person  That dummy  What do you mean powerful?  Powerful  Shut your mouth  Money doesn't make you powerful  Oh you're the worst  Being a good person  makes you powerful  What did I mean?  I have no idea  what you're even talking about  We're listening to Voss  recite the lyrics  from a Huey Lewis song  Being a nice person  doesn't make you powerful  Yes it does  Shut up  It does not  Doing the right thing  in life makes you powerful  What?  That makes you powerful  Doing the right thing  Does it really?  Affirmations in the mirror?  No it doesn't  Really?  Yeah it does 
[02:14:00]  I am powerful  Just because you're powerful  At the end  So really?  So it matters  if Reagan was a nice guy?  What's that?  It matters if Reagan  was a nice guy?  No he was a powerful guy  Exactly  What I'm saying  What I'm saying  is powers from within  What makes you feel powerful?  I hope you're thinking that  as your car slams  into an abutment  As you go through  the windshield  and your little feet  That's really  Do you think that's  a nice thing  to wish on a person?  No  It's not  I have my mother  on her honeymoon  my mother and father 
[02:14:30]  Luckily I'm here  because on their honeymoon  That explains it  On their honeymoon  they went through  over an embankment  down  Both of them  went through  the windshield  if a tree  didn't stop the car  they would have  went through  the windshield  and into the water  Wait so you got  brain damage  before you were born?  That's what happened  No I'm saying  They were both  on their honeymoon  Six year old  Bloody on the windshield  on their honeymoon  That's why their marriage  didn't work out 
[02:15:00]  How about that?  There's something like  that coming  You think that's why  the marriage didn't work out  or maybe the disappointment  bringing home D's  they couldn't handle  anymore  they blamed each other  for you  Little Richie Voss  coming home  I tried to teach him  With another crappy  report card  That was always  their favorite  How many were there?  Me, my brother  and my sister  The brother and sister  were probably doing well  so they would say to Rich  You're our favorite  They were just appeasing you  Meanwhile yeah  They hated the thought of you 
[02:15:30]  You weren't really  the favorite  What's the deal Steve?  Steve  We got lookouts  Plenty of them  So what do we got?  We got  He's walking up  from 30 Rock right now  so we're gonna get  We'll get a heads up  when he's up the  or down the block  He's walking all the way  here from 30 Rock?  Yeah that's a  That's a whole  three blocks Rick  See if you know Mel  also Mel walks a lot  in New York City  when it's nice out  Yeah  He's always walked around  Used to see him  walking from  the NEW building  over to Black Rock 
[02:16:00]  back in the old days  at CBS  We used to say hi to him  and he would just be annoyed  that we were saying hi to him  He just was always annoyed  What comics would you let stay here?  Like would you let Bobby stay here?  No  No  What about Patrice?  No  No  Patrice?  No  Patrice is the worst  Mel  No  Mel  Colin you'd let stay here  Why do white people?  No he wouldn't  Colin you would  Colin what do you mean?  He's intelligent  You know how Colin  Colin will just say awful shit  Colin's intelligent 
[02:16:30]  Colin's too bitter  Yeah  To see a successful  powerful businessman  He would have to  mouth off to him  Yeah  I don't think he's bitter  I think Colin's  We know you don't  There's not one comic  that I would want in this room  Not one out of the crew?  No  What about Nick?  Nick would be good  No  No  No  Nick wouldn't be good  Why don't you leave?  No  Can he  We got  He's probably only a couple  Give me time  To do what?  I'm gonna leave  Why don't you go downstairs  and be a lookout  You can phone us  when he comes in 
[02:17:00]  You just be the lookout guy  That's right  This is great  That's an important position  Finally  Yeah  It's been like seven years  since I've been coming here  and I'm finally getting kicked out  No one's kicking you out  You know I should be  I wouldn't want the pressure  of sitting here  when he's in here  It's not kicked out  It was just the thing was  that when this came down  Yeah I don't blame  Hey listen  Everyone is saying  Rich get the fuck out  Everybody on Instant Feedback  Everybody  They're only allowing me to stay  out of a sense of loyalty  Really?  Yes of course 
[02:17:30]  Danny is here  Mel is extremely intimidating  Extremely  Not if you have nothing to lose  like me  No  I'm telling you  You have a wife  and three kids  You have nothing to lose  You have everything to lose  I'm like rebel  Exactly  You're not Jimmy Dean  Yeah  You're an older gentleman  You have things to lose  Yes exactly  You have two families  Cold coffee  You suck  Jimmy someone's saying  that you sound nervous  Are you nervous?  No  I'm just pointing out  what's going on  No I actually feel  I feel fine  Alright 
[02:18:00]  You know what  Maybe I'm going to scram now  Maybe I'll go do some commercials  or something  You know how we do the commercials  here for my gigs and stuff  Are you still talking?  Yeah  Go on  Do you really have  season five of The Wire?  Yeah  Really?  Yeah I swear to God  I have all of them  Not five  It hasn't come out yet  No I swear to God  Why would I say all of them  but he's saying not five  You have five too  Not five though  Well because five  hasn't been released yet  but yeah we got Roland  that you know  gets this stuff for us  so we're prepared for interviews  Yeah  He's in the elevator 
[02:18:30]  Alright get out of here  Oh my God  Look at Rich  Rich leave  Just leave  Remember  This is light and airy  It's a how do you do  Not an inquisition  Look at Anthony  He's the one that's nervous  Light and airy  Look Eric Logan  he gave me a speech yesterday  he goes  Could you please be Greg Hughes  and not Opie  Exactly  And look  Eric Logan  Don't F it up  They're coming in like crazy  Another one from Logan  Tell Rich to get the fuck out  Yeah  Yeah we had to tell Rich 
[02:19:00]  This is a pretty big thing here  Can we have him over there?  Where do you want him?  No over there  No I'm sitting next to you  No don't screw with me  Right there  Then you better remove that chair  because I'm going to  have him take a seat right there  Oh that's the good spot  right there  You got it  That's not good  That means he's close to me  I want him to be close over there  Nah but you like  That's a better seat  because that's where  you're kind of looking  over the whole thing  Oh is it good?  Yeah I think so  Alright then  Ant switch seats with me  Nope  Please  I'm staying right here  I think it's very funny 
[02:19:30]  that the instant feedbackers  were even turning on Voss  Oh yeah  Everybody  Voss is the worst  You don't want him around  Guys  Kryptonite  Success Kryptonite  What's Mel's opening line  going to be?  Hello  Yeah  Nah he's  I was loving just  Elo just sent me a text  to tell Voss to get out  Yeah everyone's saying it  Where did Rich go?  Right there  No  No Rich hide  Oh Rich get out of here  Please Rich  Let him look through the window  I don't mind if Rich 
[02:20:00]  looks through the window  Yeah  God Rich  Voss can stare through the window  but he can't speak  Oh no he's too creepy looking  anyway Rich  We'll just tell everybody  he's a listener  Rich is a  Rich is like a hyena  Oh no  Rich is shaking hands with him  Yeah  They kicked me out  He was hoping Mel would go  Wait I know you  Yeah  Wait haven't I seen you on something?  No he doesn't know you  Please  Here he is  It's Mel Karmazin  Mel  Mel have a seat  How are you?  Kim  Kim  Nice to see you  Hi 
[02:20:30]  Anthony how are you?  Hey Mel  How are you?  Greg Hughes  We like to call him  It's Greg Hughes today  We don't like the Opie  We don't like the Opie character  much  So Greg Hughes today  I think is more fitting  And did you purposely  give me a chair  that's down so low?  Why isn't Mel's chair up higher?  If that was the strategy  I understand  and I'm happy to deal with it  And also headsets  that don't sort of fit  Instantly  So  Why is this not 
[02:21:00]  I assume the company  you work for  has not given you  the resources  that you need  Mel that's something  I'd like to talk to you about  Yes  They've been  We call them skin flints  Is that the point?  They've been a little stingy  We have a cockroach problem  in this building  A major cockroach problem  And it was before  you guys got there?  It's  Yeah  Is that a new problem?  It's been multiplying  for the last  I don't know  It could be the air  The material that comes  out of the speakers  Sure  Mel you trimmed down  since the last time  we saw you  I've been on a hunger strike 
[02:21:30]  trying to get the deal done  So I knew that  making good arguments  to the regulators  didn't work  So I tried anything  I thought they'd be sympathetic  if they knew that  there was a poor guy  who was getting  you know  IV feeding  you know  in a cell  you know  but at the end of the day  they did the right thing  Did you think it was  going to take this long?  Honestly  Well  a couple questions on that  One is  did I think it would get done  and I believed it should get done  but throughout the whole process  I really questioned  whether it will get done 
[02:22:00]  Yeah  I think everybody was  And there were  legitimate reasons for concern  based on a lot of the stuff  you know  that you read  Did I think it would take this long?  Absolutely not  because  you know  I mean  maybe I'm making it simplistic  I mean it's  okay  you got two satellite radio companies  either you believe  that they compete  with a whole lot of  other things  and if they do  no big deal  okay  and if you think  that there's a separate market  you know  called satellite radio  and oh my god  having only one company  in satellite radio is bad 
[02:22:30]  then you should be able  to conclude that  in a rather short period of time  Yeah  it shouldn't have taken  so long  I think you proved  a good point too  by saying  and pointing out early on  that it does compete  with everything else  with all this other medium  out there  and I think now  it's more obvious  than it was  even when we tried  to get this thing started  but it's a little more obvious now  but back then  it was kind of hard  to sell them on the fact  that yes  this is competing  with iPods  and iPhones  and everything else  Well you said  when we got this thing going 
[02:23:00]  you were in cahoots  with Mel Connors  I'm trying to  late night phone calls  I've been getting  obviously emails  every time  my name gets mentioned  on the show  so I'm assuming  everything that you guys  have done  has been done  to help get this  merger done  Absolutely  Mel of course  you guys have been  part of the team  I'll be honest with you Mel  it's more what we didn't say  than what we did say  to get this merger through  to tell you the truth  Well boy that's pretty tough  because I heard  some of the things 
[02:23:30]  that you said  and I didn't think  there was anything left  that wasn't said  but let me get to  your point  and one of the things  that I was hopeful of  and I even told our board  17 months ago  that this would be  very important  was that we needed  the broadcasters  to be very aggressive  in opposing the merger  and they were  the NAB  yeah  thank God  because if in fact  their strategy  were smarter  and the NAB 
[02:24:00]  didn't try  to oppose it  we had the benefit  now  of all of these  people saying  stop the monopoly  stop the monopoly  and the smart people  in Washington  are saying  well gee  if this is a monopoly  why do you care  okay  I mean  the fact that you care  and the fact that  you've spent so much money  and the fact that  you know  terrestrial radio  broadcasters  have lobbied so hard  proves that we're  in a competitive market  that would at least  include 
[02:24:30]  the 10,000 AM FM  radio stations  so add to that  the technology changes  that continue to go on  you know  I mean internet radio  you know  iPhones  you know  whatever is out there  and there'll be more  so the fact that  this merger  occurred  is great news  but there's still  a tremendous amount  of competitors out there  that we compete with  you were on the other  side of it  for a short time  too  when satellite radio  started taking hold  on regular radio  and  tried to kill it  tried to kill it 
[02:25:00]  you absolutely  I remember the ads  that would run  and it was  all about  bashing it  and trying to  so you obviously  had great insight  on what a threat  it was  yeah  I mean  I couldn't see  any good reason  why satellite radio  was necessary  coming from  a very very successful  one of the largest  if not the largest  terrestrial radio company  there was nothing  in it for me  with satellite radio  all I knew  is that when you  got into your car  you had an AM  and an FM button 
[02:25:30]  the last thing  I wanted you to have  was an XM button  that was the last  thing I wanted  the worst nightmare  came  when  satellite radio  not just came together  but really started  to grow  and the broadcasters  not liking competition  you know  talk about people  who want a monopoly  not wanting  competition  did everything  they could do  to make us fail  I mean  their goal  was not  to just  stop the merger  right  the reason they  wanted to stop  the merger  if you think about it 
[02:26:00]  I mean  you know  why would  stop the merger  matter  there still be  satellite radio  there still be  XM  there still be  Sirius  the reason  they wanted  to stop it  is they believed  stand alone  we would be  weaker  maybe fail  now I mean  you know  I've spoken  to the management  of XM  throughout this process  and they believed  that XM  would not fail  I mean  I you know  I mean  I didn't run  the company  I didn't know  enough about it  I can assure you  you're never sure  anybody or anything  but I can tell you  I strongly believe  there was no risks  associated with 
[02:26:30]  Sirius  not making it  right  you'd still be going  merger or not  I mean  it may take a year  or two more  to make a profit  I mean  at some point  you've got to  make a profit  right  but the fact  is that  the broadcasters  hope was  not just  that the merger  wouldn't happen  okay  that would be  a step  in the right  direction  but satellite  radio  would disappear  yeah go away  these same  broadcasters  were the ones  that fought  against cable  television  so when  you know  it was just  the broadcast  networks  and stuff like  that  and cable  was coming  in  the NAB  lobbied  against cable  they lobbied 
[02:27:00]  against satellite  television  so that's  what they do  and that's  I never got  the idea  of how  they could  say that  it's not  competing  that it's  a monopoly  if the  companies merge  but hey  we're not  competing with  them  yet we are  trying everything  in our power  to keep them  down and  destroy them  and one  of the things  they did  which I can't  tell you how  much influence  it had  because I  really don't  know  because it  really got  down to the  very end  and it's  two to two  and is this  thing going  to happen  and stuff  they put  a banner 
[02:27:30]  on their  building  they have  a lot of  money  all the  broadcasters  put money  to them  and they  had a banner  on their  building  that said  stop the  monopoly  and we took  pictures of it  and we sent it  to everybody  who was on  our list  because our  viewpoint was  the fact that  they're doing it  I mean  they're not  lobbying every  merger that  goes on  why the hell  should they  care  if we are  a duopoly  on our way  to a monopoly  by definition 
[02:28:00]  they're not  in that pie  right  and the fact  that they  thank goodness  for it  you know  and hats off  to the head  of the NAB  I think that  David Weir  I think we all  owe him  a but you know  when I  when Saturday  when I finally  get to celebrate  on this merger  I will be  toasting him  first  before I toast  anyone else  basically what  Mel's doing  right now  he's rubbing  it in  he's  yeah why not  how happy are you  why not  if I knew  he was listening  I would be  doing more 
[02:28:30]  I'm just assuming  I'm just telling you  the guy's  the word's gonna  get out there  and you're rubbing  it in  was there a most  frustrating thing  like that happened  like for a while  they were like  yeah it's gonna go  through it could be  any day could be  any day could be  any week  and then it  wouldn't happen  was there one  thing that  happened during  this whole process  where you were  like this is  a major problem  now I well  yeah I thought  this was a major  problem every step  of the way  because they made  it a major problem  but I never  was the one  saying it's gonna  be any day  so it was the press  it was different  people saying it  so I sort of  knew what was  going on  and I never 
[02:29:00]  knew and it  wasn't gonna be  over until  it was over  so on Friday  of last week  we got word  that the third  commissioner  at that point  it was two to two  and we got word  that the third  commissioner  had voted  for the merger  but I still  had not gotten  the official notice  that said  the FCC  had approved  it  we didn't  so I wasn't  even celebrating  at that point  so it wasn't  until we got  the final word 
[02:29:30]  which was about  four o'clock  on Monday  and then we  had to finish  raising a bunch  of money  that we needed  because  I don't want  to get complicated  but XM  had a bunch  of debt  we needed  to raise  a billion  250 million  to refinance  that debt  that was a  change of control  this market  you know  is sort of  not a great  market to raise  money in  so until  Monday night  at 7 o'clock  when we got  the money  did I finally  press the button  to close the 
[02:30:00]  merger  and we closed  it by 8 o'clock  but it was  you know  a long process  including four  congressional hearings  a senator  met with me  privately  and said  that if  I would agree  to apply  the same  indecency  rules  that broadcast  radio has  that he would  support  the merger  a senator  very close  to the NAB  probably  a senator  very influential 
[02:30:30]  senator  that obviously  close to the NAB  as a lot of them  are because  again  the NAB  is you know  with all due respect  is probably  one of the most  powerful lobbying  organizations  in Washington  all of the  congressmen  and senators  spend an awful  lot of money  and want to  get re-elected  and the television  stations  and the radio  stations  are very important  for them  and they're  in their community  and they're  you know  they represent  their constituency  so with all  the respect  you know  for the  you know  congressional process 
[02:31:00]  there were  many people  who were  against the  merger  and these  as far as  the congressmen  who wrote  letters  and the senators  who wrote  letters  they're helping  their constituents  I mean  they don't feel  that they're doing  something to interfere  with our merger  they're saying  if somebody  who is  in my district  is having a problem  I'm going to try  to help  that person  that's in my district  how do you answer  somebody though  that says  that they want  to put the same  restrictions in place  and FCC regulations  on satellite radio 
[02:31:30]  well very simple  the answer is just  no  very good  it was really  it was not a long  discussion  about it  and if I  needed to  elaborate  is that  people have decided  that they want  to pay  $12.95  a month  that it's  not over the air  broadcasting  where you're worried  about children  listening  that this is  a paid service  and it would be  the same argument  that MTV has  or the same argument  that HBO has  or any of the 
[02:32:00]  cable channels have  so unless someone  was going to try  to enact a law  that said  that you couldn't  broadcast these words  and these discussions  on cable  or satellite television  and satellite radio  and if the Supreme Court  were to uphold that  then it would become law  but for that happening  there's no  nothing the FCC  could do  or anything like that  nor should they do it  hey let's get to the 
[02:32:30]  bottom of the issue here  did you or did you  not bring pink slips  for us  no  no  pink slips  that you know  a lot of people like  I know Mellie's  he's going there  just to fire the guys  which I wish I would  laugh really hard about  by the way  well no I mean  it didn't hurt you  that I did that once  I mean that was a very  that was a very  profitable deal  for you guys  that was kind of fun  I mean  but anyway  so  this is the first time  we've seen you since  well since that whole  awful thing went down  six years ago  by the way  we have not been in contact 
[02:33:00]  first time we've talked  and Ant and I  are very used to  meeting you  when we were in trouble  we never had the  the nice meeting  we had one nice meeting  in the office upstairs  well you guys just  weren't nice  so what would happen  I mean what would  happen would be that  I was always this  charming nice guy  and you guys would  just be dicks  and come up into my  office and be the  way you guys are  and uh  they can be dicks  but there's no need  to ask all  that's Jim Norton  by the way  if someone has to  get fired  a lot of us  could stay  how satisfying was it 
[02:33:30]  to watch Eric Logan  run out of the building  with his tail between  his legs before you  got there  oh and let me tell you  I was a big  and still am  a huge Eric Logan fan  Eric worked for me  in terrestrial radio  well I'm talking about  the Eric Logan  that works for XM  well no  I think he has  grown and gotten  more experience  I saw Eric yesterday  and I am absolutely  a fan  and as a matter of fact  you know  Eric has decided  that he was going  to move on  but had Eric 
[02:34:00]  not made that decision  there was a very  important position  and he knows it  and he knows it  the trash has to go out  I understand  it does have to be  taken out of the building  and the windows  have to be washed  and it's a very  important position  so I guess  so you guys are not  Eric Logan fans  no I actually  we love Logan  he actually kept us  safe  he's a great friend  we finally decided  Mel after the big  fuck up  that we were going  to like listen  to somebody  finally  nah  then maybe  then I'll bring  the pink slips out  because you guys  listening to somebody 
[02:34:30]  is something I don't  think would exactly work  when you sit out  two years  three months  you have a lot  of time to think  and you're like  you know what  maybe it's time  to listen to somebody  in this business  and by the way  you know  I mean  because every time  you guys talked  about me  people made it a point  oh it's entertainment  Mel  you understand that  oh I absolutely do  no I absolutely do  and they probably  got it wrong  in the translation  they made it a point  to give me  you know  the tapes of it  right  so I'm aware of it  but the one thing  as I said  I think that was unclear  okay  is that I followed  the contract  in other words 
[02:35:00]  if in fact  you're a contract guy  you always have been  no but if in fact  there was a contract  that basically said  that you know  we didn't have the right  to take you off the air  believe me  that would have been  a scummy thing  to do  there was a point  we wished you didn't  follow the contract  because we wanted  to work again  well yeah  so I mean  the fact that  we were smart  okay  in so far  as designing a contract  that provided us  with the ability  to do what we did  was honorable  may not have been  liked by you  and I wouldn't like it  at all 
[02:35:30]  at all  I mean I totally  agree  why don't you  let us work again  why don't you  make us sit out  for two years  were we competition  at that point  absolutely  I thought you guys  were terrifically talented  I mean it wouldn't  I mean I sort of  was involved  in hiring you  right  I mean okay  so at this point  I thought that you guys  were absolutely terrific  I thought that you  were great talent  and why on earth  if I can pay you  not to compete with me  would I want you  to compete  so on one hand  that was frustrating  on one hand  well talk to the lawyer  I don't know who wrote 
[02:36:00]  the contract  but if you didn't want  me to be able  to do that  it shouldn't have been  in the contract  that you guys signed  who reads those things  though  who reads those things  well that's good to know  that's good to know  so no  I mean I thought  that decision  was an easy one  you know  and even during the process  somebody came along  and said  well you know  what if we gave you  some money  you know  to let you out  and you know  and other things 
[02:36:30]  there was a  whatever  I don't want to rehash stuff  but none of them  it was a tough thing to sign  they didn't give me  enough of an incentive  to not have you  compete  I don't want to bring up  the reason why  we had to meet with you  but it's one of our  favorite stories  in radio ever  we fucked up  many times  but on this particular  occasion  we got the call  that we had to see you  on January 2nd  this city was cleared out  there was no one  in Manhattan  and Anthony and I  walk up to your  huge office 
[02:37:00]  and you made us wait  20 minutes  which was very calculated  I'm wiping my hand  because I'm sweating  like I don't want to  you know  he can't see me sweat  and then you walked in  with the most classic  line ever  you want to see that?  oh that one  yeah yeah  that was  the question's  boggled me for years  it's not really a question  there's no real answer  to this question  it was  what time do you wake up  in the morning  and decide you're gonna  fuck Mel Carmen  and I'm like  that isn't even  it's already been  predetermined that you're gonna  it's just what time is it? 
[02:37:30]  so the reason I kept you waiting  is I needed to have  the right opening line  oh that was it  so you gotta  just give me a clue  as to what the subject was  at this time  it was a Howard thing  oh okay  so here was the deal  we're really trying  not to go down that road  well I don't know  but it was a Howard thing  and I was sitting there  like do we answer  do we say 10 o'clock  do we say 11  do we say we don't do this  yeah  what was the answer  to that question?  there's no answer  I don't know  I guess the answer  is that you guys  don't sleep a lot  I thought you had 
[02:38:00]  a death wish  in other words  I just assumed  you had a death wish  because I had made it  very clear  that you know  we're in  this is a business  okay  and in this business  we make a whole bunch  of money  a whole lot of money  from Howard Stern  just a tremendous amount  as a matter of fact  when CBS  let him go  their revenue  200 million dollars  affected  when Howard  good or bad  200 million dollars  why on earth 
[02:38:30]  would I want  anybody  okay  anybody  who works for me  to hurt me  in so far as  hurting my money  so I didn't see  from  you know  you guys got a  first amendment right  but I got a  first amendment right  as to what goes on  on my radio stations  so you got a right  to say things  and I got a right  to not have you say it  and we then  have a point  so it wasn't  if you guys made  and that's where  the death wish was  because we wanted  to just fight it out  and you wanted  to sit there  we were brave enough  to just fight it out  and figured  you know  he's strong enough  that he could just  fight back  oh he could 
[02:39:00]  but the winner  would have been  clear channel  and the winner  would have been  you think  of course  because as you  divide  and you  let's assume  there's a scenario  okay  and let's take  your scenario  where you might  I don't know  whether you'd ever  have damaged Howard  but let's assume  the attempt was  to do that  and therefore  you accomplished it  and you took  something away  from Howard  that would make  when we went  to advertisers  because we were  getting a whole lot  of money there  we would get less  and who would get 
[02:39:30]  more  would be  these other  broadcasters  that we competed with  because we were  as prepared  to sell you  in the same way  and you know  we had general managers  that worked for you  so I think  it was just misguided  I mean I think  in my opinion  it's sort of  the team  you're on a team  okay  and instead of  worrying about  the opponent  you're fighting  with the guys  on the team  and forget  whether Howard  I mean  I could have  a conversation  with Howard  about what he did  as well  but for this  conversation here  you guys decided  to fight  with the quarterback 
[02:40:00]  okay  you know  as important  as you guys  were on the team  and you decided  instead of worrying  about going after  Scott Shannon  or going after  we went after  everybody  I just want to  so much more  mature now  though Mel  and that's  water under the bridge  does that mean  the shows  have become  more boring  I hope not  I never thought  I'd be asking  about congressional  hearings  to lighten it up  this is good  though  I think it's  really good  I just want  to one more  point  we can move on  I just want  to let you know  that at the time  our goal was 
[02:40:30]  to make sure  Howard didn't  hurt our stock  that was the only  thing we were  we weren't actually  trying to you know  knock him out of  the game  we were making sure  he wasn't going  to knock us  out of the game  and that's where  the confusion was  because we saw  growing up  what he did  to other radio  shows  and it was ugly  man  these guys  had massive  ratings in their  cities and stuff  and Howard was able  to just wipe  them off the map  that scared the  shit out of us  when we came to  New York  into his backyard  and that was  our whole goal  going into that  maybe it got  confusing  and there was  a gray area  but our whole thing 
[02:41:00]  was let's make  sure he doesn't  do to us  what he did  to DiBella  and the rest of them  and that's the  area that I think  that you guys  and I had a  disagreement  because you guys  thought  that he was  doing that  and maybe  he did  in other words  I did not  hear that  or sense that  and I had told  you had a  as a matter of fact  the program director  so that when you  guys left  it wasn't about  me dumping it 
[02:41:30]  on you guys  the general manager  left  everybody who was  responsible  left  and  not so much  that event  but the sense  was that  I had made  clear  what would  work  in our  company  and it  appeared  that there  was a  willful  violation  of what  I had  made clear  to the  general manager  at the time  would be  acceptable  so if  Howard was  violating  anything  that you  thought  was hurting  your brand  and hurting  you  that didn't  come to me 
[02:42:00]  it came  to me  you know  when you guys  reacted on  the air  but that was  the history  I just wanted  to finally get  my point out  there whether  it's right  or wrong  that's really  what our  thinking was  back then  I like the  other idea  that said  you guys  had a death  wish  we sort of  did  you see where  you put us  any W  you can help  us out a little  bit  you can put us  on Howard Station  in New York  and we wouldn't  have had a death  wish  that would have  been amazing  for everybody  involved  and as a matter  of fact  any W  sucked except 
[02:42:30]  for our show  and Ron  and Fez  who started  doing a really  good job  at the end  so you remember  Tom Chisano  oh sure  didn't you work  for Tom  we love Tom  now  Tom's great  we used to  hate that guy  Tom is great  and remains  a good friend  we love Tom  Tom was the  general manager  of that radio  station  he used to  call us up  Tom did not  want you guys  on the  I'll tell you  it wasn't because  of your talent  he didn't want  you on in the  afternoon  because he  believed that  he had a  controversial morning  show  that some  advertisers 
[02:43:00]  weren't going  to advertise  on  so he wanted  a station  that would  have an  ability to  have those  national advertisers  someplace else  so it was Tom  because in my  opinion from  a image point  of view  from a brand  point of view  I mean it  would have  become what  in essence  Howard did  with his  channel  you know  on the other  satellite radio  company  you could say  serious  you own it  now  well no  I know  I can say  it  I just  don't want  to you know  disrupt your  listeners  we've been  saying the  other company  for too long  it's serious  xm radio 
[02:43:30]  no but I  mean I  think that  you know  Howard  had a vision  for a channel  that would  have all kinds  of content  that would be  really compelling  and you know  very different  than everyone  else  and it would  have fit  perfectly  but the  advertising  scenario  wasn't attractive  I remember  one nice  meeting we  had with you  and man  Mel had the  best office  in Manhattan  the greatest  view ever  you saw  9-11 happen  from your office  I remember  we talked  about that  but you were  like man  I just wish  you guys  and Howard  would just  get along  and you know  maybe I could  somehow get you  guys together  and you were  starting to try 
[02:44:00]  to figure some  out  and now we're  one big happy  family  well we're just  you know  getting some of  this out  and then we can  move on with  the future  but more importantly  is Charlie Rose  a nice guy  you did a hell of an  interview on Charlie Rose  I'll tell you  I've known Charlie  for a long time  and he is a hell of a guy  and he's a great  interviewer  and I just did CNBC  before I came over here  and you get like  six minutes  you know  and the idea  is I mean  I want to talk  I mean you know  I mean if I'm  going to be interviewed  I don't want to  have a sound bite  and Charlie gives you  an hour  and it's great 
[02:44:30]  and he's smart  and he's terrific  he's not intimidated  by anybody  I watched him talk  to Schwarzenegger  and Bloomberg  together  and you know  he agreed with  him and certain  things you know  he holds the paper  and puts his hand  up and he'd stop  them and he'd get  like a real interview  it wasn't like  a fluff interview  yeah no he's  terrific he's really  good what a boring  question that was  I'm getting very nervous  he was just  he was just  turning the truck  he was turning  the truck around  I think he's trying  to demonstrate  that if for any  reason you guys  weren't around  there's a role for him  on one of our  news talk stations  he's still there  he's Charlie Rose  I'm Jimmy Mortgage 
[02:45:00]  I don't want to  lose Jimmy Mortgage  hey have you  checked out the  XM research  no I was  I mean Eric said  we did great for  XM  but it was reported  in Arbitron  that we didn't do  so great  and it doesn't  make sense  something doesn't  doesn't  you know  so I feel very  comfortable  being able to  talk about  anything I know  right  so the Department  of Justice  yeah you're not  allowed to look  at that stuff  until the merger  goes through  I understand that  so the first time  I was able to 
[02:45:30]  get to XM  was yesterday  so I showed up  at XM yesterday  had a town hall  meeting with the  employees  first time I got  to do that  have not seen  any you know  contracts at all  have not had access  to any information  have no idea  about anything  other than the fact  that lately  I've been getting  emails from  your fans  Jesus Christ  knock it off  what are you  what are you  trying to do  ruin us  so you should 
[02:46:00]  assume  they might be  Howard fans  making believe  they're our fans  that's all I want to say  then that would  explain it  then that would  explain it  the reason that  they were doing that  were they positive  emails like  congratulations on the  boy Mel  you're one hell  of a guy  what a great  company you've built  if you get rid  of O&A  let me tell you  what's going to  let me know  can I really fast  I listened in on the  conference call  on the train yesterday  I want to thank you  because my elbow  is sore  because I was like 
[02:46:30]  this for an hour  what conference call  with the employees  oh I didn't know  you could even  actually  yeah we were all  listening in  oh okay  and there's two  things I want to  bring up  who fainted  during the meeting  so I'm  also I hear  are you alright  and then you're like  yeah whatever  just drag her out  I got things to do here  so good thing  this is radio  so people might be  able to believe  what I'm going to say  so because of my  startling good looks  that very often  when I take the stage  women like  you know  swoon over me  and collapse  so it's just scary  so we're having this room 
[02:47:00]  it's a horrible facility  to do it  you know we have  you know  a whole hundred of people  cramped standing up  in this thing  and at some point  I didn't even know  if it was a woman  or a man  about halfway through it  just collapsed  and the you know  security came  and they carried her out  so I afterwards  after it was over  I went to try  to find out  what happened  and it was a  a young girl  who works there  who just fainted  and she was fine  and I asked her  to go home  and she didn't  want to go home  and you know  you know  I had a car outside 
[02:47:30]  and said  can we take you home  and no  and she  so the people there  really don't want to hear  Mel say go home  at this point  and you think about  maybe  you're fired  for fainting  instead of using  the other words  so  yeah basically  get a cloak  so she asked  I said to her  it's happened before  she said not since high school  so I mean  you know  it just seemed  she fainted  so  and then another guy  asking about health insurance  I'm like  health insurance  there's so many questions  you can be asking  so what I was  well  what I was shocked  about is  and again  I thought you guys 
[02:48:00]  lost a step  okay  because I remember  in the old days  when I'd have  a shareholder meeting  okay  you know  there would  there would always be  but  you know  we'd be having  a shareholder  I swear  we never set that up  I swear on that one  right  and I swear  we have passionate fans  I swear we did not  set up those calls  so you know  that there were those calls  right  so I'm waiting now  for my  you know  Opie and Anthony  questions  you know  and was sort of  disappointed  that I didn't get it  so in answer to it  so I have not  had a conversation 
[02:48:30]  in all  due respect  and I mean  as important as you guys are  I had not had a conversation  until I saw Eric  you know  late in the afternoon  and he had told me  that there's a contract period  or something coming up  it's the first I heard of it  and I know nothing about it  I don't even  believe it or not  I don't even know  what you guys make today  so I'm sure  it is bizarre  it is  ridiculous amounts of money  don't look at our contracts  but I'll tell you  it's a lot of money  I'm assuming  so anyway  but that's all I know 
[02:49:00]  compared to Howard  we got 63 days left  oh do you  yeah  and are discussions going on  I bet you're chomping at the bit  to maybe even get a call  from Robert Eatman  Super Agent Bob Eatman again  he doesn't deal with Robert Eatman  I don't think I've ever met  I'm not sure I've ever met him  you ever take melatonin  so  no but in all seriousness  there are no discussions going on  63 days and counting  but then no discussions  were you  no I think the whole thing was  you know  nothing was going to be done  until the merger went through 
[02:49:30]  so  I'll make sure  all I can do is make sure  that there's discussions  we want to continue  we love the freedom  of satellite radio  I think the people at XM  seem to be happy  I mean I'm not hearing  saying  thank God you're here  so you can fire them  no one has said that yet to me  right  so I'm assuming that  if in fact  you know  you guys want to stay  and if in fact  XM obviously is happy  why don't you say  all I can do is facilitate  make sure that there are conversations  and you know we got like  a thing going on  with regular radio  how does that make you feel 
[02:50:00]  here's my attitude  because I've said it before  we're asking people  to pay $12.95  right  we're asking them  to pay for something  so the ability  the more we give them  that's the same  the less desirable it is  so if we started  putting commercials  on our  you know  forget those few  clear channel stations  that XM is stuck with  right  if we started to  put commercials  as an example  on our music stations  you'd sit there  and say  why would  somebody subscribe  to satellite radio 
[02:50:30]  because they're going to hear  those same obnoxious commercials  there  so the more  exclusive content  you can have  the better off  it is  so in a perfect world  okay  where I'm going to pay  a good amount of money  right  it's going to be  because  the only way  a subscriber  can get  it  is on  satellite radio  so if in fact  somebody feels  that they  need to be on  terrestrial radio  so as an example 
[02:51:00]  we currently carry  Sean Hannity  I'm a huge  Sean Hannity fan  but Sean is on  a whole lot of  terrestrial radio stations  and he's on  satellite radio  without getting into  amounts  you should assume  the amount of money  that Sean is getting paid  is not  really material  right  because of the fact  we love having them  but you know  there's an AM FM radio  generally  every place  where  there's a satellite radio  I mean  there's not necessarily 
[02:51:30]  satellite radio  everywhere  there's an AM FM radio  so if somebody  wanted to hear  something that's on  terrestrial radio  they can just push  the button  now that  and you guys  I know it's different  right  so I mean  I know what you're  doing different  and stuff like that  but we had  an important performer  where there was  a disagreement  with the programming  people on how much  money he wanted  and he wanted to keep  doing satellite radio  and what we did  was we carved out  a few markets  where they were on  which were not  so material  to our subscriber  growth  right 
[02:52:00]  I mean it wasn't  New York  LA  Chicago  I mean it wasn't  a top 10 market  it was sort of  a few smaller markets  this is the Bubba deal  that's the Bubba deal  so in the case of Bubba  where you know  we've said  okay  you want to do  a terrestrial radio  and a satellite radio  fine  I understand why  you want to do it  I wish you didn't  I wish  you know  Sirius was able  to justify  the money  you wanted  but you know  it's not  so in order for you  to do  what you need to do  and what you want to do  and he's a terrific talent  we're going to carve out  you know  Tampa  two other 
[02:52:30]  you know  markets  and he's doing that  but you know  why would I want  Howard  you know  forget you guys  because you know  you got it committed  to be on  interrestrial radio  why would people  pay $12.95  right  Bubba said yesterday  that if we stay  with a new company  it's a deal breaker  for him  are you guys  and Bubba  not  I've never even  met the guy  I could care less  like Ant said  he's not on the board  yeah  there's a deal breaker  for him  so  deal breaker  for the merger  I would hope  that Bubba  you know 
[02:53:00]  I think Bubba  is a great talent  and you know  as I said  it disappointed me  and I went to  the programming people  to see if in fact  there was a way  you know  to carve out  more money for him  and what Bubba  thought he needed  or wanted  was just more than  what Sirius  was prepared to pay  so this was a compromise  but it is a compromise  because I don't think  it's good  I think that  you know  if HBO  started running  commercials  during those movies  you know  or during their stuff  it would look like  another channel 
[02:53:30]  and why do you want  to pay for something  you know  you don't  I mean  you pay for CBS  and your cable bill  but people don't  sort of think about that  if it's just going  to be another broadcast  so basically  you're saying  we could do both  which is good  that's what we needed  today  okay  so  alright what else  can I answer  why don't we  move on with the future  so the merger  happened  so I have  just so you know  because I mean  you're a busy man  I'm sure  no I'm not  this is very important  but I have a  because I didn't want  where you gotta be  I have a town hall meeting  with all the employees  so the same  Sirius  at Sirius  okay  at 1030  okay  alright really fast 
[02:54:00]  in the future  because now the merger  went through  everyone is really  really confused  like how is this  going to work  the ABC  so let me give you  just a few things  and I try not  to bore everybody  if you combine  the two companies  today  we have  2.2 billion dollars  of revenue  right  which makes us  the second largest  radio company  in the world  so only Clear Channel  is bigger  than we are  and we're going  we're growing  and they're not  if you combine  the number of subscribers  we have about  19 million  the only company 
[02:54:30]  in the subscription  business  that's bigger  than us  is Comcast  so we have  more subscribers  than Dish Network  DirecTV  Time Warner  cable  so we now  finally have  a critical mass  a big company  we also  are going to have  some synergies  so there will be  cost savings  and be making money  down the road  if you're an  XM subscriber  you're listening now  your radio  will not be obsolete  nothing will change  right  I mean  you know  nothing will change  somewhere down the road  you know  probably in the next  two to three months  we're going to announce 
[02:55:00]  that there's an opportunity  for existing XM subscribers  with the same radio  that they have now  to be able to get  some content  from Sirius  not all of Sirius  but some content  from Sirius  and by the way  vice versa  the same thing  so the Sirius subscribers  will be able to get  select XM programming  are you willing to say  what some of that  Sirius program  would be available  obviously Howard  exactly  obviously Howard  would you go something  like the NFL  so here's what  I've said  so I mean 
[02:55:30]  so far  and what I've said  Howard for sure  and selected sports  programming  and other programming  so we will  as soon as we can  because we  you know  got to look at contracts  so you know  the first question  if I do  if I now say  what's going to be  available from Sirius  on XM  the next thing  someone's going to say  well okay  what's going to be  available from XM  on Sirius  and I haven't  seen a contract  right  so I have no idea  would you like us  to be heard on Sirius  well if in fact 
[02:56:00]  you were with  the company  right  no I understand  why wouldn't I  sure  no absolutely  if we were with  the company  well no  I mean you tell me  you have a contract  that's up  and I have no idea  but if this were today  okay  why wouldn't  I mean  you had a large fan base  you're entertaining  I mean you know  would you keep this channel  or just our particular show  what else is on the channel  Ron and Fez  I want to give a plug in  for Ron and Fez  they're great  what else  other than Ron and Fez  maybe  maybe Than and Sam  no just kidding  Ron and Fez and us  yeah I mean  that's pretty much it 
[02:56:30]  I don't know if that means  a channel  well we got some others  but we'd have to look at  you know  we'd have to have some  discussion with programmers  but  so let's assume that  the programming people  will sort of  take a look at  what is available  and what's possible  and make the decision  but you know  I don't know  Ron and Fez well  I knew they worked  for us in Washington  at one point  they're extremely talented  I know  the feedback that I got  from them was terrific  you know  I have only good things  you know  that I've heard about them  so if in fact  our programming people  said you know 
[02:57:00]  that Opie and Anthony  and Ron and Fez  would be part of  that offering  that sounds great to me  awesome  will my horrible  boring Charlie Rose  question hurt me  during the  is your contractual name  the same name  as you use on the air  no  oh ok good  so this way  I'll never know  it's not a picture  on there or anything  can I have a question  about too  the one thing  they keep saying  in the papers  about the iPods  and I guess  content like  spoken content  stuff you can't get  on an iPod  is the best way  to compete  because every article 
[02:57:30]  now with satellites  it seems like the media  is just trying to  shit on the merger  so I think  I mean I think  after this merger  right  there's just a  tremendous amount  of competition  I mean I think  the broadcasters  are competition  I think HD radio  whatever that'll be  you know  as it evolves  will be competition  internet radio  wifi will be everywhere  you'll get it  in your car  there'll be competition  iPhones  you know iPods  so I think  our success  is that we really  want to have  the best content  so it's not  about content  it's ubiquitous  I mean there's  plenty of content 
[02:58:00]  that's out there  it's having content  that can't be  replicated elsewhere  and that's what  our mission is  right  so if you start  with us today  being the second  largest company  in this audio  entertainment space  so yeah  will there be  internet radio  companies  yeah  but like  which one  is going to  be our  competitor  I mean specifically  you know  if you're buying  a stock  okay you can buy  well Clear Channel  is going to become  private so it will  be the largest  publicly traded  radio company  so you can buy  a Sirius  or you can buy  a what 
[02:58:30]  you know  and I'm not  talking about  a device company  Apple is a great  company and stuff  like that  but what internet  radio company  are you talking  about  or you know  what other  kind of technology  so I think  we're really  well positioned  you know  to compete  in the future  and I think  it's real important  you know  which is why  I'm here  right  I mean I think  important content  is real important  you know  and as long  as we're smart  in being able  to keep our focus  on that  we think it's great  what's the next step  the next step  is to make it happen 
[02:59:00]  I mean the issue  is the  as grueling  as this has been  it's the easy part  right  I mean now it's got to work  I mean  for the XMers  when will they be able  to start listening  to serious programming  I know you said  in the fall  but can you give  people a taste  before that  you mean listeners  well no  the only  I mean  what has to happen  is that  there's a certain  amount of bandwidth  right  we based on  compression technology  that with  you're getting  everything you get now  right  everything you get now  you'll then be able  to add some  selected channels  some few channels 
[02:59:30]  right  if in fact  we have  let's assume  that there's an XM  channel  that is  in a similar genre  as a serious channel  but it's a better channel  right  you know  I mean it's programmed  better and you know  then why wouldn't we  want to make it available  to serious subscribers  as well  so I think  as time goes on  the content  will morph  toward each other  yeah get rid of  the redundancies  but not just get rid of  make them better  in other words  so if we both have  a 70s channel  why not make  the best 70s channel 
[03:00:00]  from both of those  and make it available  to subscribers  on both services  right  I mean you know  if we both are doing  5 or 6 country music channels  you know  I mean  why do 10  unless there's 10 great ones  why not do 5 really good  and make them available  on both services  and that's something  that we would like to do  as fast as we can  because the thing  that we want to do  is to make sure  the churn  so you know  you want to get  additional subscribers  and then you want to keep them  and I think  the better our content is 
[03:00:30]  right  the better our content is  the more we keep them  so that's where that focuses  can you tell people  to start buying radios again  because I know  because of the merger  no one was buying  and I went into  the Best Buys  and the Circuit Cities  and those displays  were like dusty  and they were pushed  to the back  because no one  knew what was going on  so they're like  why am I going to invest  in a new unit  if I don't know  what the hell  this merger  is going to do to me  and you don't know  how painful it was  for me doing  exactly the same thing  right  so  and I think  what happened  and I've spoken to  you know the CEOs  of these  you know Best Buy  and Circuit City 
[03:01:00]  is that  if you think about  Blu-ray DVD  and HD DVD  and consumers  were confused  and they didn't know  which one to buy  so they didn't buy  anything  so you got now  it's like you got  this AM radio  and you got this  FM radio  and they're sort of  separate  and you don't know  which one  you know to buy  right  so the hope is  that now that  the merger is there  we'll be able to  eliminate that confusion  be able to talk  about the fact  that both radios  are going to work  you can be able  to get 
[03:01:30]  you know  the content  you know  the best of content  and by the way  just buy satellite radio  I mean in other words  you know  from our point of view  I'm indifferent  you know  whether it's XM  or Sirius  and the great news  for the company  combined  is that every car company  every car company  you know  is putting  you know  these satellite radios  and we all know  from being in the radio business  if you want to be successful  in radio  it's the car  and those deals  were made a long time ago  and they're finally coming  penetration is coming up  finally yeah  because a lot of these deals  were like  well starting in the year 2008 
[03:02:00]  and it was 2005  when they made the deal  so that's going through the roof now  so I told you guys  that I've got to leave  so I've got to leave  but I do want to come back  with the CDs I have  you know  of all of this stuff  and what I want to do  and what I really want to do  is play them all  okay  and be able to have the comment  of why you characterize me  I mean  some of them I understood  but there were some  that even I couldn't understand  you know something  I would like to hear them  because I doubt  any of that was me 
[03:02:30]  I bet it was open  you were out sick that day  yes I think I was  or sleeping on the air  it's absolutely terrific  thank you  thank you for inviting me  thank you for everything  you guys have done here  could you give me an example  no  is it real bad  listen I was born  you know  in a tough neighborhood  okay  and you know  I mean I grew up in New York City  and went to public school  and stuff  and I heard words  that I had to go to Howard  to ask me what they were  oh boy  maybe we start over now  sounds like a good idea  maybe we start over  we say goodbye to Mel 
[03:03:00]  and we thank him for coming  like gentlemen  and we take a break  and then we all just go  wipe sweat off our hands  Mel  two things  who does our agent talk to  who's the boss  and we'll announce that tomorrow  okay  what's happening  is that the assumption  is going to be  so someone will get a hold of Bob  I'm assuming at this point  yeah  so why don't we leave it that  like that  okay  and the second thing is  I'll have somebody do that  can we take the rest of the day off  because this was a really tough interview for us  and now that you're working for me  I don't know exactly what your schedule is  but if you know 
[03:03:30]  if you're making a lot of money  I would assume that this is a 24 hour  seven day gig  yes  constant  there you go  alright guys  thanks and thanks for everything  you guys have been doing  you've been helping us get a lot of subscribers  Mel  it was a pleasure seeing you again  take care  thanks  yeah  thank you Mel  we'll be back  that's great  thanks  alright we'll take a break  no go go go  we're taking a break  we'll be back  well that didn't go too well huh 
[03:04:00]  oh that was wonderful  and you heard  you heard from Mel  we could leave  but so  you're  you're  you're lucky to have us  still broadcasting today  I didn't hear him say we could leave  yeah he didn't  I didn't either  I heard it in there  he seemed to be implying  that if you're making a lot of money  which we're not  so that meant  we could have left  who's farting  I got nervous  that was the fear  leaving my body finally  dude holy shit  he was fine  he was very cool  he's intimidating  not as a guy though 
[03:04:30]  it was like  it was almost like  he just came down  and just started  it's because you know  that he could  wreck your life  if you wanted to  but like as a guy  he just came in  and he was  you know  he seemed pretty  he was comfortable  yeah  Rich  were you listening to  the big interview  with Mel Carman  you know what I like the best  how you turned  and it was  it's true though  and I never realized  this about you  about the Howard thing  you guys were just  on the defense  oh that was a lie  stop  huh 
[03:05:00]  that was a lie  I know but how he made it  look so real  you  I was really amazed  at that interview  just listening  if I was in the car  you're amazed at a pinwheel retard  that's true  my Charlie Rose question  I thought  yes  that was such a  please  well that was a joke  get off of this  I know  Charlie Rose a nice guy  but then he called me out  and said it was a boring question  it's a good sign  first day on the job  what the hell's he doing  on one of the shows  exactly  my platform 
[03:05:30]  yeah get the chinless  dullard off the air  hey uh  where's uh  Don Wicklin  ah  Don lucky to still  have a job Wicklin  well he might have been  fired on the uh  did he fire you  did he fire you  on the elevator  or in the hallway  or something  no  I didn't want to kid  about it  because it's going  to be ugly  for X-Mers  in the near future  but real soon  some serious people  too  but probably much more  X-Mers  but I didn't have  the heart to ask him  that  because there's  some good people  that are going  to be out of work  down there  I wanted to ask you  about the shitty logo  there's a reason 
[03:06:00]  Mel left for the day  I'm thinking  he was there yesterday  he's going back  tomorrow  yeah yesterday  he did the town hall  meeting  with everybody  he's waiting for the wolf  what  no  uh  right  yeah the wolf  yeah the wolf  to kind of clean up  all the blood and stuff  and he'll be back tomorrow  the wolf will be here shortly  yeah you know  he's a  he's a  he's a businessman  always has been  he's all business  he knows the deal  you like the interview Donnie  you know I was really impressed  I hope you seriously  um 
[03:06:30]  I think you guys  did a great job  you asked the greatest questions  yeah  you answered everything  he's very  I thought it was very helpful  when I mentioned  the most frustrating part  yes  because during a process  there's a lot of frightening parts  and I felt  yes  that really bring it home  what was the most  you wanted to know  the most  if anybody out there  could have seen  what a douche I was  holding my pen  he should have taken it  and fucking stabbed me  in the throat  he probably wanted to  I was holding the pen  like a gentleman's  about to ask a question 
[03:07:00]  yes  excuse me  a gentleman is asking  a gentleman's question  if I may  what was the most  frustrating part  no I stressed the  because the most  would have made me  sound like an asshole  what was the most  what was the most frustrating  implying that there were many  yes  but what was the most  I even tapped my pen  like this  that commands power  you douche  Mel what was the most  his next interview  you're the answer  what is the most  frustrating part  of the O&A interview 
[03:07:30]  you know what  you get it  I'm so glad I walked out  I wish I was  20 feet tall  so I could just  bite through you  that was a  that was a good line  if I would have  delivered it right  it was good  it was good to see  Mel in the short chair  he looked like a little kid  and then  that helped us actually  but then Steve comes over  he looked like the kid  in Fast Times Ridgemont High  like you know  at the table  on that date  Steve comes over  and basically  takes their headphones  off of Mel's head  and Mel like  grabbed them  like 
[03:08:00]  hey you fucking  fruit  get your hands off me  hey Steve  why did you tackle them  and make the headphones  fall off that way  I thought that I would  help him  let's go to the phones  they're chomping  Darren North Carolina  yeah the whole time  Mel was talking  all I could think about  was little Jimmy's  Mel Carmazzi bits  well that wasn't a bad one  that was basically  making fun of the person  who screwed his name up  when I said Mel Carmazzi  because somebody  that was in Congress  or what he was doing  that didn't have his name  right  it's like it's not  a hard name to get 
[03:08:30]  yeah  Steve what are you doing  they're whispering  about things  that men of their ilk  understand  we're getting the audio  out to XM's PR department  it's racist  Texas PR department  yeah  it was so funny  I really wanted to  introduce  Steve  hello Mr. Carmazzi  I had the chance  outside  and I didn't do it  in a stupid voice  you might know me  from my band Foundry  hi Mel  you'll know me  for the next three weeks  you'll see me no more 
[03:09:00]  no it was just funny  watching you pull  the headphones off  because he was wearing one  did you see how  he put them on his head  he slapped one of them  he almost worked his ear off  no I didn't  I'm sure he knew  it was not right  and he was fixing it  but then you rushed in there  and just kind of  grabbed him off his head  I fixed it for him  like it was a hat  it was courteous  could the pest help us out  we're going to say  some fine things  about Mel Carmazzi  and we need these tapes  sent over  immediately  oh they'll edit them  make them sound horrible  nice things  horrid people they are  that's what we should have claimed  oh you know  they edit that crap  it's not true  let's say hi to Jeremy 
[03:09:30]  in Cleveland  Jeremy  hey boys  just wondering if your jaws  are hurting from all the  love thirst  alright  it was nice  what are we supposed to do  curse  hold on hold on  let's be realistic here  for a second  what are we supposed to do  curse out the CEO  the new CEO  of the company we work for  no  answer me  you cuss him out  but you know  you guys  did kind of  back down  but what  what did we  back down on  what did we  not address  we addressed  everything  we talked  what were we  supposed to do  get in his face  give me an example

[03:12:00]  Mel Carmazzi  but the thing  was it was like  that was a great  thing  I mean uh  show of good  faith is what  that is  in the business  world  it's a show  of good faith  he came in  and sat for  45 minutes  he didn't need  to do that  no  um  so you know  no we're not  getting fired dude  and I never  thought we would  why would you  throw off a show  bye  especially when I  always raise the  tough questions  oh you're great  Mr. Mel  most frustrating  the most frustrating  someone should have  put a fucking  fish hook in me 
[03:12:30]  and caught a bass  with it  fucking worrying  nothing  Mel Faber-sham  it could have been  it could have been  worse  we could have  had Rich Vossen  here  now Rich  oh that would have  been so bad  what would you  make believe  Don Wicklin is  the great Mel  Carmazan  I'm calling him  the great Mel  Carmazan now  make sure you get  that tape off  to Mel  immediately  now Rich  what would you  say to Mel  Carmazan  you got a chance  to make an  impression  what would it  be  go ahead  well in the  future  could you see  Opie and  Anthony and  Howard on the  same channel  one in the  morning and 
[03:13:00]  one in the  afternoon  let's see one  of them watch  12 hours apart  that's a good  question  it's called  an IMPM joke  Rich  actually that was  a good question  I can't falter  for that  maybe we should  ask that  who knows  I think  he sort of  explained it  but basically  there's no  there's nothing  in it for him  or the new  company to  just throw us  on Sirius  but if you  throw us  on Sirius  and make  them pay  to hear us  then you're  getting more  revenue into  the new  company  and here's  the next 
[03:13:30]  question  and the  same with  their programming  over here  just throwing  it on  XM is not  going to really  help  well what I  don't understand  and maybe I  got this wrong  I thought  throughout the  last couple  years  XM had more  subscribers than  Sirius  they did  then how  with more  subscribers  would Sirius  be able to  take over  XM  it has to  do with  debt restructuring  as to why  it worked  that way  and Mel  was probably  the stronger  CEO  not to knock  the other  ones  but I mean  come on  he's Mel  it's a debt  thing  and it's a debt  thing  but it's also  Sirius caught up 
[03:14:00]  them adding  Howard was really  it was a smart  move  they never  caught up  no but I mean  compared  XM didn't continue  to beat them  by as much  as they did  they were  closing the gap  big time  did Mel  have to do  paperwork  I'm assuming  Master Poe  made him do  paperwork  sit down  let's say hi  to Kevin  in Houston  Texas  Kevin  yeah  hey  what's up  guys  great show 
[03:14:30]  today  really  I gotta tell  you  I really  respect  Mel  Carmisen  now  for coming  on the  show  but I gotta  tell you  these  fucking  listeners  out there  that bash  you guys  for you  know  not asking  the tough  questions  shut  the fuck  up  quit  listening  if you  don't  like  it  it's  amazing  they're not  fans at that  point  they're not  fans  sorry  what question  should they  ask  but let me  just jump in  they're not  fans at that  point  they're haters  there's a lot  of haters  that are 
[03:15:00]  disguising  themselves  as fans  and the  show's not  going to  change  this is  what it  has become  and if  you don't  like it  anymore  if the  show's  passed  you by  then go  somewhere  else  you're  not a  fan  anymore  you're a  hater  and you  should get  a bloody  tampon  thrown at  your head  like for  instance  why should  they have  a treat  that's right  copper candy  as I call it  love it  they disguise  themselves  as fans  but they're not  fans anymore  the important  thing here  they might have  been  we have a

[03:22:00]  life we had in  afternoons  i love  i love what a life we  had  i like mornings believe  it or not i'll tell  you why  because even though  it fucks my night  life up i live like a  human being and i like  the replays we get if  we go in afternoons we  lose a lot of the  replays you like the  life you like like  after this i got to go  to my lawyer's thing and  close on the storage  unit all this shit i do  like real life living i  had to do bank stuff  it's just these little  things that you do  when i'm working that  i'm up until seven in  the morning i'm getting  up at two and coming  in at three but you 
[03:22:30]  can do that up until  three o'clock in the  afternoon that's not  what i do though  wait you need a  lawyer to get a  storage unit  all right  that the fact that  oh god here he  goes this is what i  like he's off  always find the  important part of  the story  um you know  yes  two jews walk into  a bar they own it  isn't one of them  sober  but now i'm serious  why would you  need a lawyer to get  a storage unit  did they have  pilsner glasses  or were they the 
[03:23:00]  regular water glass  for the beer  yes  how old is  saint paulie  girl  that's a good  question  is it a good  question  i'm ted the rich  boss  i'm ted the  rabbit tooth  jew  i chew  nickorac  i'm in  ball bubbles  all right let's  continue here  i'm as dumb as a  bag of me  let's go to  charlie and fill  one charlie  one iq what's  that yeah i know  we don't have a 
[03:23:30]  one forty one iq  we all saw the rock  animation you don't  have a one  you don't  we do a one  forty one  we'll do it again  shut up yeah we  will do it again  charlie and philly  what's up  what's up  hey  hey rich how are  you  that is funny charlie  does this mean we  can have you guys  going to have  floor back in  studio man they  were some of the  greatest shows  yeah i think we'll  be able to do a  lot of crossover  stuff to help  promote because we  want to promote our 
[03:24:00]  stuff on sirius we  want to promote uh  jimmy's stuff over  here of course i think  that's i think that's a  yeah an obvious uh  thing to do but i'll  tell you right now  about jim brewer  there's a space  there's a there's a  there's a space waiting  for him in our fucking  comedy show saturday  man how great would  that be if fucking  brewer hit the stage  for 15 minutes to  say hi to some old  some old pals  god  is brewer  is brewer uh  working today i think  our uh fans should  like uh really put 
[03:24:30]  the pressure on him  how great would that  be and brewer would  kill we love brewer  because there there  was times uh we were  going to do some things  with brewer over the  last year or two but  there was it was  uncomfortable because  of the two different  companies but now  there's no excuse  there is a spot waiting  for him on saturday if  he wants it in front of  eight to ten thousand  people in his hometown  i want to do the  corioli brewer show  yeah i want to go in  studio and do that  show we used to do it  a lot bonnie and i  it was fun  yeah you fucking  traitor no i'm not 
[03:25:00]  a traitor i'm glad  that's coming out  finally traitor  i fucking called for  permission  well yeah but that  was just me being nice  we figured you would  do the right thing in  the end i've done the  right thing for years  man i told man  can't go fuck himself  oh i turned down  other people we'll  talk about i've  turned down a lot  yeah who else who  you know what don't  worry martha scoort  all's i know is  martha the sports  guys  all's i know is i'm a  loyal guy that's all i  know are you yeah 
[03:25:30]  are you really yeah  why would you need a  lawyer to get storage  been because it  believe me it makes me  sick to my stomach  it's uh because it's  considered deeded  property here in new  york deeded property  oh so you need a jew  lawyer to get in there  and negotiate your deal  for you i didn't see  you talking about the  jews when mel was in  like that what you're  right there are i i  they're just lawyers  dirty only lawyers  yeah for the most part  only good ones you want  an irish lawyer yeah you  don't want that next 
[03:26:00]  time you say then say  you're good jew  lawyer i just it goes  hand in hand with just  saying a jew look it's  why does that sound  derogatory well are you  serious okay a jewish  lawyer no but you say go  get your jew lawyer that  doesn't sound it's a  compliment they make  great lawyers like also  get my jew doctor go  get your jew lawyer would  you say that about a  black person uh no  they're not jew unless  it was sammy no go  get your jew one-eyed  entertainer you're my  african-american oh now 
[03:26:30]  it's african-american that  it you know it's a  negative thing the guy's  that thing on the top of  your head again you look  ridiculous i can't don't  why can't you jewish  people understand that it's  a compliment it's it's a  compliment to your your  uh uh intellect your  drive as a people to  get the if you say up to  lawyer or doctor or  something like that is  amazing accomplishment if  you say most good lawyers  are jewish compliment if  you say if you say go get 
[03:27:00]  your jew lawyer on go get  your shine box was that a  compliment no it's a  compliment all right if i  say go get my italian  lawyer what's wrong with  that because guinea lawyers  the equivalent of what you  say people say a jew they  don't say uh oh this guy is  a jew they don't say that's  not a bad word is that a  bad word as far as jewish  people go it's not to use the  word you and you say that  because it scares the person i'm  getting my jew lawyer because  you're thinking oh boy it's 
[03:27:30]  scary because then you know  what they're doing right  lawyering right it's like  being at an aryan brotherhood  dinner you've never been to  my house then let's see what  a real one looks like um i  gotta go backwards because i  don't feel like getting the  phone call later rich i was  kidding about your loyalty  you're loyal to the show  because later on oh he's  gonna call and you know i  really did turn a lot down  i just want to mention that i  turned down this show and  this show and this show and  because me and bonnie were  gonna go on even the baby's
