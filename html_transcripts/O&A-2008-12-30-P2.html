<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a bizarre and sexually explicit discussion centered around "Sperm Bowl 96," a competition between Opie and Anthony to determine who had the higher sperm count.  The loser's punishment involved crashing into a wall, potentially with an airbag deployed. This was preceded by Popeye-themed, sexually suggestive jokes. The conversation then unexpectedly shifted to a detailed and enthusiastic discussion about the release of Nike's "Back to the Future" shoes, with several callers contributing trivia and anecdotes.

The show returned to "Sperm Bowl 96," detailing the logistical challenges, including timing the event with a stopwatch and the awkwardness of transporting semen samples.  Past outrageous stunts were recounted, and Dane Cook was mentioned in relation to a radio ad.  Don Newton, a lab technician, was a guest, bringing professional equipment, including gloves, which became a source of amusement.  Kippy Love was called in to conduct a coin toss to determine who would go first. The segment culminated in a graphic description of Opie and Anthony's on-air masturbation attempts, including Anthony's initial attempt with a novelty sex toy, and their subsequent detailed accounts of the experience, peppered with crude humor and anxieties about hidden cameras.  Don Newton then analyzed the samples, revealing the sperm count results.  Following this, a "cherry dart" game involving topless women throwing cherries at a target near their buttocks was discussed, with Sandy Kane adding sexually explicit commentary. JBL from WWE made a brief appearance.  The show then delved into a discussion about an incident at an S&M club, focusing on legality, BDSM practices, and sexually explicit anecdotes from the hosts and callers, including descriptions of sexual acts involving urine, feces, and blood.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on Adam, a new intern. His "car crash dancing" on a local New York dance show was mocked using audio clips.  The hosts and guests then aggressively questioned Adam about his virginity, lack of kissing experience, and sexual preferences, using highly offensive and sexually explicit language.  He revealed details of his personal life, including his masturbation habits, pornography downloads from LimeWire, and preferences for certain body types. Patrice O'Neal was mentioned as a guest stuck in traffic.  Shelly, another guest, engaged in a staged interaction with Adam, attempting to initiate conversation and a kiss, highlighting Adam's perceived awkwardness.  Other staff members, Derek and Saeed, shared their opinions of Adam.  The show included a note from Ron and Fez criticizing Adam's behavior near their studio.

Further segments detailed more of Adam's unusual behavior, including his claim of never kissing a girl at age 22, prompting speculation about his social awkwardness, potential molestation, or homosexuality.  His lack of dating experience and potential penis size were discussed in vulgar terms.  The show also touched upon his family life, deaths of his grandfather and a baseball coach, past counseling for depression, and a live phone call with a co-worker, Jessica, whom he had a crush on.  His admission to shoplifting from Target (Teddy Grahams, hand sanitizer, and Vaseline) and use of a sex toy were revealed, leading to suggestions of a lie detector test and speculation about whether he was using a "bit."  His Zoloft use was also revealed.

A combative interview with Adam ensued, challenging his veracity about past violence (broken hand, throwing glasses), stealing DVDs and selling them on eBay, and inconsistent statements about counseling.  His eBay selling history was examined on air, and a lie detector test was again threatened. The conversation then shifted to a discussion of favorite movie guns, with various callers and hosts contributing. This included descriptions of firearms and movie scenes and an anecdote about a woman firing a Desert Eagle. The topic of Adamâ€™s behavior was revisited several times during the gun discussion.  Adam eventually left the studio, with the hosts speculating about his character. The show concluded with a brief outro featuring Patrice O'Neal and comedic sound bites.

I've yet to see a picture  Well, they have laces  So not exactly  So they're not exactly  Everyone knows 
[00:09:00]  Marty McFly's shoes  Did not have laces  But we haven't achieved  That technology  And sneaker yet  I see Danny  Another expert  Has walked into it  To join us here  What?  The Back to the Future crap  Why?  Oh, God  Actually  There's been a  You know how people  Make these blogs  And you can sign up  To like an online petition  Or whatever  Yeah  There's been a petition  Floating around for at least  Probably two or three years already  To get the  Marty McFly 2015 Nikes  Produced by Nike  And this  And finally  Finally 
[00:09:30]  This dream  This dream  Has come to fruition  Can I tell you  What about the self-drawing jacket?

It's the pinnacle of sneaker technology  From the late 80s  Yeah  And it sticks to a hoverboard 
[00:10:00]  Like no other sneaker can  Yeah  Plus  If you go to  If you're looking at the movies  And a big hologram shark  From Jaws 15  Comes out at you  As long as you got your  2015  Marty McFly's on  You're gonna be able to avoid it  Is that another  Back to the future reference?

[00:20:00]  How can we  It's fantastic  I can't believe  You haven't seen it  80 times  Like we have  Danny and I  I've talked about  Doing an entire  Saturday Night Virus show  Just revolving around  Back in the future  Count me in  I'm so there  I don't think  It has been on  Where I have not  Watched it  I don't care  If there's five minutes  Left  It wasn't even  That good of a movie  It's fantastic  Thank you Jimmy  Thank you  No cause you're  Looking at it  As a movie  Not as an event  It's not a lifestyle 
[00:20:30]  It's a nostalgic event  Even Back to the Future 3  Which was terrible  Is awesome  Of course it is  The over the top acting  Yeah  Of Mad Dog  Buford Mad Dog  Buford Mad Dog  It was fantastic  Oh I would not  Tangle with that  No  Of course not  What kind of a name  Is Clint Eastwood  Oh jeez  He called himself  Clint Eastwood  What a scream 
[00:21:00]  I know  You're now talking about  Back to the Future 3  3 yes  3  Well you know  It was a trilogy  My hair missed correctly  It was a trilogy  So it had to be  And it was filmed  At the same time  As 2  They actually filmed  Them both  Simultaneously  Oh wow  That's why if you pay attention  At the end  After the credit says  To be continued  Yes  To be concluded  The end 
[00:21:30]  The end  Right  That's how it was  To be continued  After the first one  Yeah  Which was a little odd  To watching the two  Different actresses  That played Marty's girlfriend  I have another piece of truth  Yes Danny  When Back to the Future 2  Ends and it says  To be continued  Then they show a trailer  For Back to the Future 3  That was the first time  That a movie ended  With the trailer  For the next movie  Since I think  Russ Meyer did it  In the 60s  Wow  Mondo  Back to the Future  Wait hold on  I don't think  That qualifies as trivia 
[00:22:00]  Because nobody  Would ever think about it  That's almost like  A bit of trivia for you  But these three windows  I'm looking at  Someone thought  They might be four  But then they decided  To make them three  Anything can be trivia  This is  No I think  Danny's trivia  Is more evidence  That Back to the Future  Was a groundbreaking film  Of course  And an achievement  In cinematography  Why was your  Different girlfriend  Because Elizabeth Shue  Who played the girl  I believe  Had prior commitments 
[00:22:30]  No her mother  Actually  Was diagnosed with cancer  And she spent a lot of time  In the camera  So she couldn't  Commit to the  How do you know this  Not a very big part  Though for the girlfriend  They had to take her back  Because they didn't plan  On making a sequel  When they finished  The first one  And when Doc  Comes back  Of course he says  Marty Marty  It's your kids  So they had to  Take them both back  And then they just  Laid her on a bench  And left her for a while  What do they  Turn into  You can't say that  You can't say that  On the air  But we know 
[00:23:00]  What you're gonna  Everyone knows  The line  Travis  I think  Didn't they  Reshoot some of  The first movie  Yes they did  With the new girl  When she walks up  To Marty  As Marty's looking  At his brand new truck  His four wheel drive  1980's truck  At the same time  Biff  Is waxing the car  Of course  Biff turned out  To be the guy  Just waxing the car  And I like how  The McFly's  Come back from  Tennis I believe  Yeah  And comment on  Biff 
[00:23:30]  I hope that's  The second coat of wax  And they discuss  How they met  Through Biff  Right  Through Biff's  Attempted rape  Right  Of Marty's mom  It's like  Oh if it wasn't  For Biff  We never would have met  Oh that's right  He was trying to  Rape mom in the car  Cause that's  George McFly's way  Of looking at  Biff waxing that car  And saying  Who's raping who  Now Biff  Oh okay  I always wondered  About that  Why would they invite  The rapist 
[00:24:00]  Right  The man that  Actually was trying  To rape your wife  Over your house  To wax your car  He's humiliating him  Biff is now  His manservant  Cause he is  He walked in  Very excited  With the books  Yeah  Just finishing it now  Biff  Now Biff  Okay you got me  Don't con me  You got me  You got me  Alright stop it  For the love of God  Just stop  Holy  Stop

[00:25:30]  No way  What  No  By the way  What the fuck  Where did that come from  And you're wrong  The winner  Would be the one  Who crashed into the wall  Without an airbag  Dude no fucking way  We were  Why don't I remember that  I'm officially uncomfortable  Because you have a  Concussion from crashing  In a wall  The loser  But we goofed on  On that bit  When  When it was done  By another

[00:30:00]  That's it  Of Spermable 96  We might have to  Stopwatch though  Huh  We start when we  Start actually  Or when we leave the studio  We gotta hash this out  It's gonna be kind of  Like an obstacle course  You're gonna start  The stopwatch in the studio  And then you gotta run out  And then the participant  Has to run down the hall  With the little cup  Into our office  Which is on the other side  Of the building  So literally a couple dozen  Employees will have to  Check us out  We get into our office  Da da da da da da  Come running back  And we stop the watch  Is that fair?  Yeah but that could be 
[00:30:30]  A little awkward too  I can't believe this  True  You gotta run  You gotta run through the halls  With a cup of that  Yes  What is your trip?  This whole thing  Is a very embarrassing thing  I can't believe this  Is in the Olympics  It's just unbelievable  By the way  Our office was  It was a storage closet  That's what they thought  Of us  And our wacky  Kooky radio  Full of cum  And t-shirts  Tears  Our desk would be  Piled up every day  With new pieces  Of radio equipment  With reams of paper  And all that shit

[00:31:30]  Absolutely wrong  Because I thought  This was a good show  If someone asked me  I heard that you guys  Did a show called  Sperm Bowl 96  Or whatever  I would have said  Yeah that was a  Really good show  Man we had a great  One that day  But I remember  I would absolutely  Say that  Two other radio hosts  Had tried this  But they had an  Unofficial stopwatch  So they couldn't use it  Well the official  The official stopwatch  Is sponsored by  Well I mean  If you're going to use  The actual footage  You know what 
[00:32:00]  You know  I say we  I say we do this  Let's get it out of the way  I believe it belongs on  Can you do this  On a free FM or no?

[00:35:30]  Opie any chance we could linger lesser  He's got all his equipment and everything man  He's got a raincoat on basically  I guess it's a lab coat right  Well it is waterproof so essentially it is  I don't want anything on me  Okay  I'm telling you we're doing this for real  People are convinced we're not actually going to do this today on the radio  But we are  We're going to find  You laugh like John Candy and Stripes  Peaches on this flight  A movie on this flight  A movie on this flight 
[00:36:00]  The insecurity is coming through loud and clear  Because I said  You know people aren't going to  Aren't believing this  But we're really doing this one  I know you guys didn't believe the other one  Now that I think about it  You didn't believe the blimp thing did you  But we're really going to fucking jerk our cocks  Until cum comes spewing out of the head  Well if your audience back then  Is anything like now  They were doing the same thing  Fuck  Cock  God  Okay  I'm telling you we're doing this for real

[00:44:00]  We look like assholes  We certainly do  Alright we're going to take a break  That's a fucking perfect  Perfect  We were those two guys in the studio  Oh yeah  We thought our fucking songs ruled  Cause that magic  Was yours  That magic  Those tapes  There's magic on those tapes 
[00:44:30]  A-Rock  Does it get better than this?  Yeah  It gets more disturbing  Yes  Alright  Alright cool  Quick break  Let's just do one break  We're probably going to cut the first hour of today's show  Cut the first hour  You know when we're just battling  About the election  Don't forget tonight's Friday  Is on Route 9  Alright  More from Sperm Bowl  96  After this  Hi this is Hillary Swank  And you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony  It's degrading 
[00:45:00]  That is just horrific  It's a freak show  Just let this show die then  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  They should be shot  We're trying to like  Understand this  This show from 12 years ago  Sure  And the thing I was thinking  Anthony and I were definitely  Happy to be doing this radio for people  And it was getting a good reaction  And you know it was  I mean I have  I don't know how  I don't know how either  But the radios were good  But it was  They were happy at the station  I remember all that crap 
[00:45:30]  Right  And then somewhere along the line  We found our voices  Because I blame Dave Douglas  Because he would beat us down  And I think he really wanted us to do  Truly like morning zoo type of shit  Like at least like  This is hacky  But it's kind of edgy material  The presentation sucks  But to jerk off on the air  No one was doing that  Right  So you know what I mean  So it was like  We're kind of like  Have a morning zoo presentation  But our bits were kind of  Quote edgy  And Dave kept beating us down  And he wanted us to do 
[00:46:00]  Actual morning zoo bits  And that's when the anger  Started getting injected  Into the radio show  And we finally found our voices  Like this is what we really  Want to fucking do  That's what it needed  Was that little pinch of anger  There was no anger whatsoever  In this shit  Sarcasm something  Yeah  And we found that  Thank God  Because we did have like  Edgy stuff we thought  Would work on a show  Thank God for the incompetence  Of Dave Dickless  Because I read  Because we went down memory lanes 
[00:46:30]  The old receptionist  From that station  Wrote us  I told  Well I told you  I read the notes  To Anthony this morning  And she reminded  She didn't remind us  But she wrote in this  Little memo  She goes  I remember you guys  Going into Dave Douglas'  Office every Monday  So I guess we had a meeting  With the program director  That's hilarious  Why would you ever do that  That'll happen  And I guess we had meetings  Every Monday  That we were forced  To have with him  And she wrote in this note  That I read in today  She goes  I remember you guys 
[00:47:00]  Leaving that office  Just fucking pissed  Every fucking Monday  I never saw you guys  Leave that office happy  Once  And then we'd go on the air  And make believe  Give us shit  I guess  Alright here we go  We're in the middle  Of sperm bowl  1996  Also known as  Sperm bowl  96  The testing procedure  I don't know  If mine's ready  This is really  Too much  How are you going to know  Who was ready  I don't know Jimmy 
[00:47:30]  I'm smiling so much  I can't even talk  Let me get inside  Anthony's brain  I'm smiling on the outside  Because I want to kill myself  My wife is driving me nuts  And I don't know  How to divorce her yet  I'm just weeping  And weeping  It's still  What is it  It's still  Three years before  I'll get out of this marriage  So  Oh my god  Help me please  You're always going to sound  Like you're  You're wrapped in an air of mirth 
[00:48:00]  I don't  I don't know where the fuck  That comes from  You were just happy  Go lucky  Oh god  But he wasn't happy  Yeah but you were  Banging nails  Four months before this  Now you're  You're sitting in a  Thank god for Opie's loneliness  So you would have never had a job  I'm obviously not there to contribute  Sure you are  Thank god Opie needed somebody else in the studio  Oh brother  Really too much man  I  You know when you talked about this  A couple of months back  Right  It all sounded fine and dandy 
[00:48:30]  But now that  Now that zero hours here  It's like  How the hell am I going to go into another office  Through a whole studio full of people  And come out with everybody knowing exactly what I just did  And now he's got the  Saline solution here  He's got test tube  This looks very official and scientific in here  And what's the procedure  Basically we're going to mix it in  Two mLs of saline  And mix it up  Let it sit for a few minutes  I'm going to put a little bit on the counting chamber  And we're going to put it on the microscope  And we count  The chamber itself has got 
[00:49:00]  Marked off into squares  And we count the four squares  Do a little multiplication  And tabulate the results  You actually physically count these by eye  You see them actually squirming around  And actually squirming around  Well what if one how?  What if one's hiding behind another one man?  Well then you just  Oh wow  Well what if one sperm is  You know fucking the other sperm in the ass  And you can't see the other sperm man  Man  Hey man  Save me a poke  Something must have happened to him man  Who are you Jim Morrison? 
[00:49:30]  I'm actually  Jeff Spicoli  I'm actually enjoying the music bed  Oh yeah  Never ending fucking music bed  That's right  It does add something to the show  They insisted that they have music beds  To distract from the fact that you were listening to some shit  It does  You should add music beds to this show  Like you know  It's a good idea  Shut up  A couple feedbacks  Yeah  It must be good  Yeah  This is like when you thought your dad was cool when you were young  Then you found out he was a virgin until 21  Yeah  And then Philly Tyrant 
[00:50:00]  Were both of you guys still living together at this point  Laying in bed at night  Giggling and all proud of yourselves  We jerked off  We jerked off together  Tee hee  Tee hee  Their little feet with socks on them  Sticking out from under their covers  Here's uh  Some people I'm reading are suggesting  I sound like this  When I'm doing my smiling talking  I'm coming you dumb bitch  I'm coming you dumb bitch  Not really  The dialogue in the porno tapes was more believable  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth 
[00:50:30]  Did you guys really live together at one point?  Uh  Well in Anthony's  I had a little  Yeah we had a living  Mother-in-law's house  My mother-in-law's house  He lasted about a month  I stayed there over a year  With his mother-in-law  We were fucking pathetic Bob Kelly  If I ever see the old Opie on the street  I'm gonna fucking kick him in his cunt  Just beat the piss out of both of them  How you doing future Anthony  How's the radio business going?

[02:09:00]  I don't think there's another throw necessary  There is though Kyle  You gotta get two  Because if one  Someone else bullseyes  Yeah  You need  Wow  It's very close  If not a bullseye  Yeah it's close  You're right  That's a good one  Two good shots  That one's up high  Wait does he have to measure that?  That one a little high  A little  We should call this one a bullseye I think  Okay  Really?  Yeah it's a bullseye  Alright a bullseye  That guarantees the next round  Red rum's up 
[02:09:30]  Getting better  Don't slip  Don't slip  I think I got him  I think I got him  All right  It fell on Sam's thumb  Red rum is  It penetrated your uterus  Red rum knows  Red rum knows how to play catcher  The back of the neck  Is it  Oh Joe you're on the way of the camera  Yeah there you go  And  Oh  Uh oh  Uh oh  Red rum's in trouble  Oh boy  Top of the ass there  On the right side  Three inches 
[02:10:00]  Oh no  That could be a problem  Red rum is not happy  She is pissed  Alright we got the southpaw though  This guy is very unpredictable  With his throwing style  Wait she wasn't even ready  Slow down  Hey  Well let her get it ready for you  She's walking out to the mound like a catcher  Yeah let's slow it down  Calm him down  Slow down  Let her prime that thing for you 
[02:10:30]  He's nervous  There you go  Oh Jesus  You know you're ruining it for all of us  Oh boy  Damn  How close is that?  Not even close Steve?

Um  You could close your ass  Throw one up on top  Leave your butt hole open  Oh wait  Ass may still be in the game  Ass may still be in the game  I think the thrower took one for the team right there  No the thrower didn't even know  I think he might have taken one for the team 
[02:11:30]  Okay  And is this the final contestant?  My favorite part is that she has her socks on  Okay  He's classy alright  Alright that's a pretty good throw right there  And the guy with the big pants pulled up very high  That's right  Is the thrower  You gotta throw some pictures out there for everybody  Oh  And he fell short  Bounces in front of the mound  Steve?

[02:15:00]  You can't do it  You can't  Believe it or not  We got official rules  We could actually get in trouble  If we don't follow the rules  How ridiculous is that?

[02:34:00]  I'm in my head!  Let's play it, play it!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  I'm in my head!  Hey, hey!  Ow!  Hey, hey!  Ow!  Hey!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I'm, hey, I don't know, I'm in my head! 
[02:34:30]  Ha!  Ha!  Drink a six pack, turn off the lights, smoke some crack, I'm beautiful!  You're a filthy whore!  Yo, this is Drew Boogie, you just heard one of my remixes on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony welcoming all the new subscribers joining us after turning on  their new XM and Sirius radios.  Describe the show a bit.  Wow.  Lots of hijinks, shenanigans, and trying to keep our jobs. 
[02:35:00]  Thanks for checking us out.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Some S&M club here in New York.  There was a story over the weekend.  You read that one?  Yeah.  The guy almost died.  Well, he's going to be brain damaged.  He's going to have brain damage.  What did he do?  Went to an S&M club.  He's a regular.  And they pretty much hung him up, but his feet were kind of touching the ground.  I guess he was handcuffed.  He had high heels on.  What else?  I don't know how he was suspended. 
[02:35:30]  Some kind of hood or something, and he was suspended.  What if his high heels broke or something like that?  Oh, really?  And his feet?  She came to check in on him for 20 minutes.  Right.  And he was blue in the face.  Hanging by the neck.  We don't know.  I don't know.  Was he hanging by the neck?  Do we have that story?  I'm looking for it.  Yeah, that was a biggie over the weekend.  And I learned something.  That S&M clubs are pretty much legal.  Jimmy, you know anything about that?  Why?  Because it's not sexual?  Because it's not sexual?  It's not sexual.  Sure you can.  They're totally legal. 
[02:36:00]  So this guy would go in there, and he would hang for hours in these dungeons and stuff.  Yeah.  He liked to be hung.  That is like the exact opposite of claustrophobia.  Yeah.  Like how you could actually hang.  I would be freaking the fuck out.  Oh, yeah.  Like put a goddamn hood over my head.  Yeah.  Then handcuff me to a radiator.  Yeah, do you fucking mind that?  These guys love mummification.  There's guys that love to be smothered.  Well, they'll put them on the table, and they'll like saran wrap their entire body with 
[02:36:30]  their hands down, including their face.  Oh, my God.  Put little breathing holes.  Yeah, like a straw or something.  The mistress will smother you with her ass and then pull off and let you breathe.  You really could die.  Wow.  That's fucked.  You ever see the thing where they put you in it?  It's like a plastic sandwich, and then they suck the air out, and you're encased in plastic.  Ugh.  And then there's something that goes in your mouth to breathe, but you're completely encased 
[02:37:00]  in plastic.  Can you imagine if somebody who's into that, what do you call it, breath play, was actually  involved in an earthquake, and the whole house collapses, and they're trying to rescue  him.  He's in there, no, it's okay.  I'm loving it.  I'm all right.  This is the ultimate fantasy.  Leave me alone.  I'm all right.  Yeah, he's covered with bricks, but he has an erection.  We don't get it.  Okay, here you go.  An unidentified patron of a Midtown S&M club.  He was bounded and suspended from a ceiling while wearing women's high heels and a neck  choker.  He was hospitalized in critical condition Friday. 
[02:37:30]  Or like the gimp, probably.  While an accident is the most likely cause, police say they're investigating whether he  was the victim of a crime.  Uh.  Why is he, by the way, unnamed?  Because he would go to the club without ID or anything.  They're trying to figure out who he is.  Oh, yeah, he is.  He was a regular.  They knew him, but they didn't know his real name or anything.  He just kind of showed up with, I forgot what they said, like just the money in his pocket  to pay for whatever.  God, I hope it's a comic that I know.  Detective.  Keith Robinson.  A man was found in 130 inside the East 33rd Street club known as Nutcracker Suite. 
[02:38:00]  The Nutcracker Suite.  An artistic innovation.  Wearing his pants but not carrying any identification, police said.  He's listed in critical condition.  He was discovered in apparent respiratory distress after a club worker checked on him  as he was suspended from the ceiling and noticed that his hands looked blue.  And they didn't arrest her, the mistress that was in charge of this whole scene.  Why wouldn't they arrest her, Jimmy?  They might get her for some kind of gross negligence, but it's not a crime. 
[02:38:30]  He volunteered for it.  He wanted it.  But it'd be manslaughter, I think, if he dies.  Again, some kind of gross negligence.  I don't know why, but it's not illegal.  It's sexual activity.  You're probably jerking off in many cases, but you're not fucking.  Unfortunately, they don't fuck you.  So you're hanging from a collar, basically, but your toes are touching the floor.  How is that sexual?  I don't get it.  How does that help you out?  It certainly is, but I don't understand it.  100%. 
[02:39:00]  You wrap yourself in plastic and you've got breathing holes.  How is that sexual?  I don't understand that.  If it's a connection to being a sexual thing.  Dude, you got me.  I mean, I just don't understand it.  Yeah, some people.  I was always jerking off.  Huh?  I was always jerking off all stuff.  If they were a face hitting me or pissing in my mouth, I was always jerking off.  I was.  Sad to say that actually really, I don't know, as creepy as some of that shit that you're  into, I guess it makes sense on some level.  But as far as like that, just being tied up, having somebody stick like a dish rag in 
[02:39:30]  your mouth that turns you on.  In a sexual way, right?  I don't comprehend it.  We're going to have to get someone to explain that.  I wonder if it has something to do with being a baby.  I was watching something interesting on Lost where they were, you know, John Locke, who  knows everything, was just covering the baby, but he tightened the blanket around the baby.  He said only when they get older do they like to not be restricted.  But when they're very young, they like to be restricted.  Like it makes them feel comforted like in the womb or whatever. 
[02:40:00]  So I wonder if it goes back to that.  It has something to do with that, I'm imagining.  Like you feel somehow weirdly comforted.  Like how now you're getting your info from Lost.  That's nice.  That's nice.  Well, I mean, I also know that it's a big fetish.  It has to represent something.  Yeah.  I don't know what.  That could be something like.  I mean, why do I, why do I drank piss?  Was I thirsty?  Drank piss?  No.  Yeah.  What's that?  Why did I drank piss?  Yes.  I don't know.  Drink.  Why did I drink?  I drank it.  Past tense of the verb to drink. 
[02:40:30]  Why did I gargle with piss like it was Lavoris?  Because of that.  Wasn't there some girl like when you were younger, you told me a story about some girl and she  smelled pissy.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  A guy and his sister actually.  The boy and the girl.  I was very young.  I was like second grade.  I'd get them both to sit on my face separately in their jeans.  You know, just smell their crotches because they just piss their pants.  In second grade?  Yeah.  Maybe first.  I fucking love that.  It's true.  What a sick little story.  I was gonna say, when were you ever just not this little pervert running around? 
[02:41:00]  First grade.  You were like walking around.  Seven or eight.  Came to school in a bathrobe when they still thought it was cute.  He's got a big heart on under it.  Oh look, he's like Rodney.  Walking around Dangerfields.  The little kid with this Cialis heart on in his robe.  Let's go to Vegas.  It's Ron.  Ron.  Hey guys.  Hey Jimmy.  You're all over here, man.  You gotta have a sex talk show, I think.  I wanna know what's sexy about the logs dropping on your chest.  Oh, I wouldn't know. 
[02:41:30]  I imagine you wonder that yourself while you're jerking off.  And after you come and you're wiping them off, you go, what was sexy about that?  300, madam.  And Richard, Wisconsin.  Can I say, I think there's certain sexuality with a woman that seems disgusting, let's just  say.  Golden shower, whatever.  Brown showers.  Um, any of that stuff that people are into.  I think it's part of it is the privacy of it all.  You're, you're seeing something so taboo and it is such an intense, it's oddly intimate 
[02:42:00]  and intense, as gross as it sounds.  Um, but there was one mistress I used to do golden shower with and this motherfucker  was sexy.  Yeah.  She just, dude.  She, she was, she's wanted, she just got it.  She would put a pussy right over my mouth and she would, uh, it would be right over my  mouth.  Dude, she was immaculately clean.  And, uh, she would just go open and I would open and she would, uh, fill my mouth and she  would go swallow.  She was so fucking sexy.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  That is fucking nasty.  Oh God. 
[02:42:30]  It's nasty if you're not into that.  Wow.  There you go.  What would you rather have?  Would you rather?  You have choice.  You're gonna have that horror.  I love how Jim tries to like, but there's a lot of people out there right now who understand  it.  And he tries to convince us how sexy it is.  And we all look around the room like.  So sexy.  And this is a swallow.  So sexy.  Be still.  And then she'd just take a dump right on my chest.  It was so sexy.  It was great.  So sexy.  Oh.  She would say open.  It was so fucking sexy.  Cause I've said that to girls.  I like saying that to girls.  And then she took a meat thermometer and shoved it in my asshole and just went deeper, deeper. 
[02:43:00]  No, no, no.  And I went good, good.  It was just this sexy.  Cause I'm filling up right now as he's talking about it.  And twist it around three times.  Just three times.  Yes.  And then unsnap it.  And it would just have that little slow, funny scrotum unwind.  No, um.  Slow, funny, huh?  I'm really dominant sexually.  Like I'm not a sub at all.  Well, that's pretty sub when she's telling you what the fuck to do with her piss in your mouth.  But she was dominating.  Yeah, but I wanted to do it.  She was dominating in a way, but it was from the neck up, man. 
[02:43:30]  That's all it's all about.  She was fucking her vibe.  Do you understand?  That was the beauty of her.  No, I don't.  No.  We're trying to understand.  There is no way I can understand a girl pissing in my mouth.  Do you ever want to have somebody wrap you up in cellophane just so you can hear that urinating sound as it hits the...  No, I can't comprehend that.  The aluminum foil.  Well, I have something in the way.  Right, Jimmy?  Right.  Exactly.  Cellophane.  What am I, wasteful?  What am I, what is this, waste nut, what nut?  What do you think, he's a rookie?  I'll fuck it. 
[02:44:00]  I can't put my mouth anywhere on a girl.  Anywhere.  But as far as piss goes, that's not...  Piss is fucking clean, man.  You know, go to the bathroom, take your piss, come out.  It's clean.  And I'll, I'll go right, I'll go right in there.  But...  I don't comprehend.  But don't piss while you're doing.  I don't comprehend anima stuff.  I don't comprehend blood.  Like fucking, they call them ruby showers.  I don't comprehend fucking...  Wait, wait, wait.  What do you find, an ulcerated fucking prostitute?  No, pimps. 
[02:44:30]  She started off on Wall Street.  She couldn't handle it, so now she's blowing people.  Ruby shower.  Wait, wait, Jimmy.  You can't just casually say ruby shower.  I don't...  That's a tampon.  She sucked a tampon or she puts her blood...  Wow.  I don't get it.  I can't, to me that's...  But that's a ruby shower?  Yeah, repugnant.  I've never involved in that.  Or Roman showers are very popular where a girl pukes in your mouth.  Um, that's, I couldn't ever do that.  Wow.  Under any circumstance.  Oh, ruby shower.  He knows all the lingo and blurts it out like, no, that's a ruby shower.  Like everyone knows.  Ruby, Ruby, Ruby.  Hey man, as long as you're not fucking animals or kids. 
[02:45:00]  Whatever.  Do what you want.  Kid animals.  Alright.  I wouldn't mind.  I almost get hit with a strap on one time.  I was tempted, but uh...  Really?  Yeah, she was one of the fucking sexiest people ever.  She was a dirty, dirty motherfucker, man.  Wow.  She would do all fetish stuff.  She would just like put a pussy in my mouth and go, no, swallow your wife's piss.  She'd piss.  She'd piss in my mouth.  And then she'd fuck me.  She was like a weird type of dom where she did full service.  It's very, very rare for them. 
[02:45:30]  Okay.  Swallow your wife's piss.  She fucking ruled.  Atta girl.  Atta girl.  Let's see what Michael has today.  Michael, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, Jimmy.  I was just thinking back to when you were all freaked out about Earl's chewed up pen.  Then you'll drink fucking hot hooker piss.  I really don't...  First of all...  Get the fucking connection.  It's obvious right now.  Here's another pen with tooth marks in it.  Oh, boy.  That's good. 
[02:46:00]  I fucking specifically said, I don't want a pen with tooth marks in it.  Here it goes.  And here's what we do with the pen with tooth marks in it.  You see that, Bill?  No.  That's where it goes.  And now we put it...  Bill has turned around.  He doesn't want to see that, actually.  In the pen pile.  So can that go back in the pen pile, please?  If Earl wants to chew pens, let him chew that one.  Oh, my God.  It's so good.  It's not good.  He sticks the pen up his ass.  Yeah, but just...  That's the good side of the problem.  See?  Put that back.  He wants to chew pens.  Let him chew that one.  If you could bring me an un-chewed one, please.  And yes, sir. 
[02:46:30]  I don't...  Chewing pens is...  If it's your own pen, it's fine, but it's being shared.  It's disgusting.  And yes, I realize it's a bit inconsistent with my thinking.  All right.  There you go.  There's your answer.  Chris in D.C., what's up?  Hey.  Air Force Survival School.  We teach the pilots whenever they're out in bad conditions.  If they're injured and there's no other way to do it, urine is very sterile.  It is, of course it is.  And if they have wounds that they need to rest, they should urinate in those wounds in order  to clean them.  Absolutely, dude. 
[02:47:00]  It doesn't say rub hot pussy juice on it.  It says fucking take a piss in it.  If that's available, of course.  Hey, real quick throwback to the John McCain thing.  Do you guys know that he was initially offered at five months into his incarceration as a  POW?  He was offered to be released because of his father's status as an admiral in the military.  Yeah.  And he declined it.  Really?  And stayed for the entire six years because there were other guys there that had been there  longer than he was.  And that's your story.  Wait, why would the Vietnamese have released him because his father was an admiral? 
[02:47:30]  Exactly.  That is exactly why.  Out of respect for his military family and because of how high-ranking his father was  in the U.S. military, they had offered him a release but he declined it because there  were other POWs that had been there longer than he was.  Well, do you think that the U.S. military-  He could have been gone in five months.  I'm sorry.  Do you think the U.S. military tried to cut a secret deal because of his father's power?  Maybe.  Like something that we don't negotiate but they were negotiating and then maybe he  said, no, I can't do it like that?  Yeah, maybe.  I wonder.  No, but he turned it down. 
[02:48:00]  That's the point.  And it's in his book.  It's all documented.  But more importantly, did he ever drink piss?  Yes.  I'd love to talk with Johnny M about that.  Johnny M.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Jim.  Yes.  Jimbo.  I'm right here.  What does it taste like?  Popcorn.  You stink.  Popcorn.  Tastes like popcorn.  Truth.  It tastes like popcorn.  It really does, man.  It can be very salty.  If it's really salty, I don't like it.  I like it when it's more clear with a tinge of salt. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, God.  It's just making me cringe thinking about it.  It's filthy.  Urine is not clean.  It is.  It's hygienic.  I'm telling you, Bill.  Trust me.  I'll try drinking my own.  Because now I need to know.  Here's what you do.  You want to break yourself into it.  You're the girl you tell.  Look, just don't wipe it off when you're done.  What if she has like chlamydia or something like that?  Well, that's different.  You're going to get that.  What does that taste like, Jim?  Guacamole?  I think chlamydia is a bad example.  Jim is disgusting.  Stop trying to make it mainstream.  It's horrific. 
[02:49:00]  It's very topical.  If you get a scratch on your knee, why have a band-aid when you just whip your dick out?  Just let it run right down your leg.  What if she discharges marshmallows?  What does it taste like?  I don't know.  Cocoa?  Any type of venereal disease is a problem.  That's a problem if you're just eating a pussy.  I'll bet you if you're eating a pussy and she has chlamydia, it'll have more of a disgusting taste than if she pisses with chlamydia.  Absolutely, which is why you don't go to prostitutes.  Well, I have regular girls, man.  I've had regular girls whizz in my mouth.  And a dominatrix is not a prostitute. 
[02:49:30]  There are actually-  But you said that girl actually fucked, too.  Oh, two different girls.  One did, yeah.  I'm talking about the one who fucked, too, Jimmy.  Okay, yeah, she was great.  I'm saying her urine was not clean.  I'm saying it was horrific.  I was fine.  Unclean urine.  She spit in my mouth and everything.  So if her piss wasn't clean, the rest of her-  Probably tastes like a Dr. Pepper.  But, dude, she was clean.  I've never had a venereal disease in my life.  I just got tested again.  Never have I had anything.  You know what, Jim?  Jim is like the reverse of those high school films where the girl has sex for the first time and it's unprotected. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And she gets AIDS or HIV.  He's like the exact opposite.  I fucking have hookers piss in my mouth.  He doesn't get anything.  He's invincible.  No, I'm not.  I've actually been more careful than people think.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, man.  Hookers pissing on you.  In my mouth.  Slices the bottom of his feet and just runs through a third world village.  Yeah.  Doesn't get anything.  He's fucking a hole in the ground in Calcutta.  What's wrong with this kid?  African gentlemen jerk off on open wounds.  Gino from Philly. 
[02:50:30]  I'm talking actually.  African sperm is very clean.  Yes, yes.  Very hygienic.  Gino from Philly writes, I heard herpes taste like tater tots.  Hey, this is David Zucker.  I just got to run.  Hey, this is David Zucker.  I just got done directing Scary Movie 4.  No, don't.  You don't use that.  That's fucked up.  No, you didn't use that.  No.  Hey, this is David Zucker.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the Madhouse.  We got to calm down, man.  I got to tell you right now.  The worst. 
[02:51:00]  The worst.  I am the worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It is the worst.  The fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.  Where is Adam?  Bring Adam in for a second.  All right.  He was one of the guys that danced.  I remember this guy.  There it is.  He's wearing a black shirt with Vince written on it.  What is that about?  The color of money.  You're talking to flair, sir.  See, it's radio.  Yeah.  The microphones are important.  It's funny.  Hold on.  It's got to be on, sir.  For them to be on.  And you would have known that if you put headphones on.  Yes.  Ah. 
[02:51:30]  There you go.  What's up, Adam?  Nothing much.  Just the Vince.  Oh, who cares?  It's the color of money.  The best of Opie and Anthony.  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.  The color of money.  Favorite movie.  I'm a big pool player.  That's your favorite movie?  Yeah.  Cool.  And Tom Cruise wore the Vince shirt in that.  And people have told you what?  You look like Tom Cruise?  No.  And that's why you're wearing it?  You want to have sex with Tom Cruise.  No.  I bought the shirt.  You've had sex with Tom Cruise.  You're like Newman's own popcorn. 
[02:52:00]  See?  Paul Newman in the movie.  Of course.  Boo.  Boo.  Fucking boring myself.  Yeah.  But I bought this shirt before Tom Cruise officially like went crazy.  So, you know.  Oh, I thought you were going to say.  So why are you still wearing it then?  Most people would just throw the shirt out.  Is it official that he went crazy?  Some official thing was said?  A statement?  He's still languishing and kind of in douchebag status.  Yeah.  I don't think he's nuts yet.  He's just kind of a douche. 
[02:52:30]  Totally crazy.  Brittany is crazy.  That's crazy.  He's a douche.  Yeah.  So you danced on Dance Dance Friday?  I did.  You like that better than The Hustler, by the way?  Color of Money?  Color of Money blows, bro.  It was okay, but Minnesota Fats?  Yeah.  His real name is New York Fats, I think, and he took the name Minnesota Fats after Gleeson  did the movie.  Yeah.  Really?  He did many of his own stunt shots in that film, too.  Not all of them, but I think many of them.  Gleeson was a great pool player.  Yes, he was.  Was he really?  Yes.  They say Newman and Gleeson had a pool match at the end of the shoot, and Gleeson just 
[02:53:00]  cleaned the floor with him.  Look how nervous he is.  And Newman just dumped a bunch of pennies on the pool table.  He's not talking into the mic.  He's slurring his words.  He's stammering.  Well, I love the fact, I do like this guy, because he took what...  This is something I do.  I'm not even shitting on you.  He took what would be an awful story, even if Paul Newman told me.  And he related, but away from a microphone and uncomfortable.  Tell the story.  Come on.  No, no, no.  You're not sitting down. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, wow.  As he was getting to the end, you ever get to the end of a story, you realize your story  has no finish?  Yeah.  And then he's fast-forwarding, and he knows pennies is the thing, and it's shit.  Oh, boy.  And he took pennies, and he did, you know, whatever.  I've got to punch this story up.  And take the hands off the console, because you're...  You're swallowing a lot.  No, don't.  The reason you have your hands on the console is because you're very nervous, and you're  trying to keep the nerves...  Yeah.  You don't know what to do with your hands.  Now they're behind your back like it's at ease of the army.  All right, now tell the same story.  Now tell the same story.  What, about the whole... 
[02:54:00]  Don't put your hands on the...  Oh, look at this.  Be comfortable.  His wrists are twitching.  All right.  That's great.  Well, there was a $100 wager at the conclusion of the shoot of The Hustler, and Jackie Gleason  and Paul Newman played each other in pool.  And, uh, Jackie Gleason...  How many comedians we got for, um...  Yeah.  Well, uh...  Ignore them.  Ten.  Excuse me?  Sorry.  You're not supposed to acknowledge that I'm ignoring you.  I...  Just deal with it.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let's go. 
[02:54:30]  We're making all the comedians outside comfortable.  Fucking poor bastards.  I don't know how it is to have to go to a set, and they're just watching this.  He knows these guys, and this shit is happening like this.  I know.  For the comedians outside, we hate this guy.  We don't know anything about most of you, so don't worry about it.  Yeah.  We just despise this kid that you're staring at as you sit on the bleachers.  We'll be nice.  Because it's a big deal.  You know, what?  The five of these guys get to the front of the line, right?  Yep.  For last comic standing.  Let me tell you something about last comic standing.  Like, a lot of guys shit on it, but we were off the air.  I was fiercely depressed, and my managers didn't want me to go out for it. 
[02:55:00]  I wound up doing two episodes, but because of a contractual thing, I couldn't go any farther  because I had a contract with Viacom, two MTV pilots.  They were shit.  Both of them were shit.  But it opened the door to The Tonight Show for me, and I've fucking done five Leno's.  That was absolutely a direct result of doing that show because of Bob and Ross.  Wow.  Book it.  And they had contacted me a month later.  And I'm not shilling for last comic standing, but comedians will shit on it.  But you know what?  It fucking opened a major door for me.  And they're like, hey, send a tape.  We'd love to see it for Jay.  We liked it. 
[02:55:30]  We did it on the show.  And I didn't send a tape.  And a month later, they called me again.  They're like, did you put that tape together?  And I'm like, what am I, a fucking dummy?  What am I doing?  They're asking me.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So they went for real.  Well, here's Adam on Dance Dance Friday with Jill Nicolini, locally here in New York.  Oh, man.  A little good fashion.  You guys are good.  Give me one more of those, like, pirouette things.  I'm standing out.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Woo!  Two boys from Michigan.  And by the way, Adam, you're going to be in New York.  I'm going to be in Anthony.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Way to go, guys.  Thanks for coming in.  That's a new show, by the way.  And by the way, they've been pushing this audio on us for the last three months.  That's why we didn't play it.  What?  That's terrific.  We can't follow it.  We don't know.  I don't even know what went on in there.  It's such a visual.  Yeah.  You were dancing?  I was dancing, yeah.  So what song?  The Canned Heat by Jamiroquois.  Do we have that song?  Well, the other thing about that audio is it was before it had been determined that he 
[02:56:30]  was going to be an intern here.  And Jill proudly says he's going to be an intern.  Oh.  So that's why a couple months ago it was a little stronger.  Oh.  Well, he got the job done.  He did.  You want to dance to that song for everybody?  Get them warm.  You know, get these people going.  They're nodding their heads.  Let's see what they're actually.  Wow.  Put the chair away.  I'd like to see.  You got that song?  All right.  Can I tell you something about comedians?  There's nothing that makes these bastards happier than to see him fucking get a dick  stuck right in his mouth. 
[02:57:00]  Oh.  The comics love it.  Thank you.  Oh boy, do we?  All right.  Move the mic.  You got enough cord to dance?  This is Adam, the intern, who's going to be part of this car crash comedy thing we're  doing in about 15 minutes.  We're just waiting for Patrice who's stuck in traffic right now.  But we got Adam.  He's going to dance for the crowd out there.  Do we have a mic on the crowd so we can get their reaction?  Sure.  All right.  We're getting that.  Patrice is stuck.  Yeah, in traffic.  All right.  Here we go.  This is Adam. 
[02:57:30]  This is the song you danced on live TV here in New York City.  And start the music.  I can't look at him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's a fantastic.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What aâ€¦  Wow.  Can you know this movie is a movie?  What a cow. 
[02:58:00]  He's pushing his hips in and out.  What a tool.  Wow.  What an absolute tool.  Car crash dancing, people are saying.  And there he is, just dancing.  He was doing the lawnmower.  See, now he's trying to mock dancing, but we know that he's trying to look cool.  No, I think he's really dancing.  He's saying he's being ironic, so it's not as humiliating.  Right, right, right.  He's being moronic.  Yes.  Patrice is stuck in a doorway, someone's saying.  He's like fucking Tor Johnson.  A man his size would have trouble walking through doors. 
[02:58:30]  All right, thank you.  I'm getting another communique.  I guess we learned about Adam today.  We were avoiding this, but I guess we have to go here.  Adam, you've never kissed a girl for real.  What's that about?  For real?  Did it for fake?  How old are you?  Dead one.  22.  Gay?  No.  No.  No, not yet.  You ever just hold a cock?  Willing to learn.  No, no.  Like, let it slap you in the face a couple times?  You just cup a cock in your hand and look at it and make comments? 
[02:59:00]  Who got you that information?  Huh?  How did you get that information?  Who leaked it?  So it is true.  Did you really never kiss a girl?  I've, you know, I was kind of, you know, kind of an outsider in high school.  Outsider.  Exactly.  Psychopathic.  Who are you, fucking show from Virginia Tech?  I'm fucking...  Thanks, Dan.  Do we get a girl to kiss this guy or what?  Where's Travis?  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:59:30]  Wow.  So all through high school?  You know, I...  Never...  I was into sports and writing and just doing my own thing.  I would then have to...  Wait, sports and writing, you should have got laid in high school.  That's a good combination.  Girls kind of like a guy that can write a little bit.  I'd then have to make the assumption you're a virgin because you probably would have kissed  the girl if you were having sex with her.  Hey, Patrice, this guy, Adam, he's an intern.  He's never kissed a girl before.  And we think he's a virgin, too.  Well, you're correct.  If I can kiss the girl. 
[03:00:00]  I'm not ashamed of it.  Mr. Patrice, I'm rocking the hoodie today.  It's hoodie day.  It's hoodie day.  I got hot.  I had to take mine off.  Adam, I keep wanting to call him Vince.  Adam, what kind of...  Stupid shirt.  What kind of sports do you play in high school?  Baseball, basketball, cross country.  So you should have got pussy for that.  You know, I was kind of a...  How old is he?  22.  22.  I don't think he's a virgin.  I think this is a game.  I can smell virgin.  I don't smell virgin in this guy.  Are you serious?  Do you think he's full of the Ronald Chicks and he's just trying to be like the interesting  guy?  Yeah.  I think he's...  Look at the kid. 
[03:00:30]  He's strapping.  He's uncomfortable.  The only thing...  The only thing...  He got the Knight Rider eye.  Like the...  The eye that...  Like the Knight Rider in front of the Knight Rider car.  And it just moves.  You can see his right eye has a problem.  He's real nervous.  And he's one of those guys that looks down and looks up.  Yeah.  But other than that, he doesn't...  He's real nervous.  He doesn't seem...  No.  He seems like he's very awkward.  I could definitely see him not being able to talk to a girl or get her to the point  where he's, you know, going to make a move.  Look at his hands.  Yeah.  I don't...  I don't fuck girls.  I awkward dialogue them. 
[03:01:00]  So, you know.  You talk your way out of pussy, but he has big hands and he's like a big kid.  Wait.  How do you blow it with pussy?  With your rap?  You're not a bad looking dude.  Yeah.  What...  Where does it go wrong for you?  Jimmy will fuck you.  Right in the mouth, that ass.  Excuse my French.  That's the mouth.  I don't really know where it goes wrong.  It's just, you know, I just haven't pursued it.  I haven't really put myself out there.  I just kind of...  I'm kind of a recluse, you know?  Yeah, but you got to be fucking, like, dying for a girl. 
[03:01:30]  How long have you been a recluse?  Why?  Wait, wait.  You're kind of like, eh, meh.  It's a take it or leave it thing with girls?  You know, I don't know.  Do you like girls or do you hate them?  I do like girls.  I don't mean in a gay way.  I mean, like, hatred.  Like, what I have.  Like, you just hate girls.  I don't hate girls.  I like everyone.  Don't you feel like you want to, you know, touch a tit?  Like, touch your pussy?  Or talk.  Do things like that?  You don't want to do that? 
[03:02:00]  You know what it's like when you first put your dick in a girl?  That feeling.  Exactly.  Do you remember that?  It's amazing.  You remember that feeling?  Yeah.  Wow.  He goes, yeah.  Wow.  Fucking.  Trying to get back to that first time ever since.  It's like heroin.  Pussy is like heroin.  Pussy is like heroin.  I feel nothing now.  It's just.  Patrice is just like an animal instinct.  Fuck it.  It's just fucking.  I could just as easily be fucking throwing a baseball up and catching it in my own fucking hand. 
[03:02:30]  Meaningless.  I only fuck so I have a memory to jerk off to later.  Jesus Christ.  Is that the fucking truth?  God, that's brilliant.  It's not living.  It is absolutely.  I'm videotaping something that I can jerk off to and make mine later.  Really?  You are a big player in this filthy movie.  That's exactly what it is.  There isn't a point where you're just like, your dick's kind of on the outside and then  you're slowly and then push and that and you're just like, wow, that's fucking good. 
[03:03:00]  Not even close.  Wow.  You guys are jaded on the pussy.  I have no sexual fucking feeling left.  I don't.  Really?  I just look at it going.  I go, boy.  Yep.  Really?  I'll still make that fucking noise.  I feel good until it's in.  I'm like, as I'm pushing it, I'm like, oh my God, I've lost interest.  There is a lot of wah-wah music in my head.  Oh, wah-wah.  And the sad thing, I have no, there's no embarrassment anymore. 
[03:03:30]  No.  Whoa.  Wow.  You guys are just like.  You probably should cheat.  Let's get back to Adam here.  Adam, do you think you might be gay, bisexual, asexual?  What's going on with you?  I don't really know what's going on.  You jerk off?  Oh, yes.  What do you jerk off to?  Yeah, you got to think about something or look at pictures.  No, what's your jerking off to situation?  You know, anything I can download for free off, like LimeWire. 
[03:04:00]  What do you like?  LimeWire, uh-oh.  What do you like?  LimeWire?  What's that about?  Because I used to be.  You go to other people's computers, file share.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Now we understand.  You know, just, you know, look, like hard.  Hard core.  What's your preference?  What girls do you like?  Somebody in patent leather.  Yeah.  A little suzy.  The same thing the fucking colonel from Boogie Nights used to jerk off to.  I don't touch them.  I just, they're so small.  Jack, are you my friend, Jack?  I just look at them. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, what do you jerk off to?  What do you jerk off to, man?  Uh, just, uh, you know, just any, any and everything.  No, what's your, what's your, you know, everything.  That's a little vague.  No, not, not like.  Hold on, we can't let that fly by.  Anything and everything.  That, that, your, your body language is saying that you are lying, my friend.  What?  Anything and everything.  What does that mean?  I've seen a grown man naked.  Well, you know, maybe once, twice.  I don't smell sissy on him at all, though.  I just don't see it.  It's not sissy. 
[03:05:00]  But something's going on.  Um, there's something probably.  Touched as a kid?  No, no.  Are you African?  Did you have one where they clip your balls with, like, so you can concentrate on fighting?  You like little plaid skirts and pigtails?  No.  Right?  I, I really, I really can't explain it.  As you should.  That's what I'm saying.  That's right.  But you can't explain it.  Why?  Well, because, you know, it's, uh, I, I just don't know.  It's just never.  You don't know what your preference is to jerking off? 
[03:05:30]  Like, is it.  Well, what was the last, all right, what was the last thing you jerked off to?  That's an easy question.  And not everything and anything.  Oh, Kenny had one.  What?  Kenny?  Kenny?  Himself in the mirror.  I didn't say it was a good one.  God damn, Kenny.  I said Kenny had one.  What's your preference, dude?  What do you like?  Wait a minute, when you see a woman, like, if I see a, uh, a little five foot, one inch,  like 160 pound animal, it just does something for me.  A little round butt.  Like 160 pounds?  I just like short, round girls. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  So.  He wants to fuck Mary Lou Redd.  Yeah.  So what do you like?  I, you know.  Like black girls, Chinese girls, white girls, tall, thin.  You know, I like, I like brown haired girls.  Uh, you know, girls have good morals.  Good morals.  Asshole, here it is.  There you go.  This fucking guy's an evangelist.  What are you, religious?  It's religious, religious problems.  There we go.  That didn't take long, did it?  Nope.  I'm not religious.  I, I don't go to church.  Who the fuck says I, I don't do anything? 
[03:06:30]  Moral.  Exactly.  Who's not religious?  You know, I, I like.  Are you estranged from your family?  Um, no, no.  He's lying.  Holy shit.  Look at his body language.  He's lying.  There's something going on.  Well, you're a Jehovah Witness or something fucked up like that?  And you, and you, and you stop and your parents don't fuck with you?  You know, you know, getting, uh.  What do you jerk off to her showing up to work on time?  It's fucking idiotic.  No, I, I, I don't know.  It's just like, uh, a lot of guys are like, oh man, I gotta get pussy or I'm gonna like  kill myself.  It's fucking, something happened to him.  I'm not, I'm not really like that. 
[03:07:00]  You know?  You scared?  That's against, you're not scared.  How big is your dick?  You know that's against God, right?  How big, how big is my dick?  Yeah.  It's, uh.  You average?  I average, like six, seven.  All right, you're not tiny.  You're packing a seven?  I, I measured it with my remote control.  And your, your, your dick is about as big as a remote?  No.  I was, I wanted to measure it, but I didn't have a ruler, so I took my key and the remote  control and kind of, you got an Irish pencil dick or as a little fat mark.  So there's a mark on your remote where your dick ends.  Yes.  Yes.  He's proud of it.  He doesn't seem like a little sissy. 
[03:07:30]  He's having a religious problem.  Something's up here.  Nothing, nothing religious.  What are good morals?  Are you tight with your, with your family?  I'm, I'm real tight with my family.  When you see a naked girl picture.  Yeah.  Does it do something to you?  Do you look and go like, wow, that is fucking hot?  I, I just go, huh, dime a dozen.  Have you ever seen a naked girl at a strip club or anything?  I, I did go to the strip club.  So you saw a live nude girl?  I got, I got a lap dance, yes.  And what happened?  What was that like? 
[03:08:00]  Uh, it was, uh, it was pretty, uh, I was pretty nervous.  Um.  But I'm, I'm talking about looking at a real naked girl, her tits, her, her body, her ass.  Like, what is that?  Doesn't that do something to you?  You don't like your fucking Lee Marvin attitude about pussy and you've never had it.  Right.  A dime a fucking dozen.  Of course it is when you don't, you ain't trying to fuck the mid-bag of shows.  Have you ever wrestled an alligator?  I'm a duck, but I'm not having.  Some of them. 
[03:08:30]  No.  Are you a eunuch or something?  No, I, I, you know, I'm just a normal guy.  No, no, no, no.  Normal guys are looking for pussy 25 hours a day.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat.  I, you know, I, uh, right.  It has a little Adam Sandler in him, too.  What do you think about all day, then?  Wow, because I know guys, it's just, it's about fucking and looking at girls walking down the street and shit.  It must just be, you're probably going to be an inventor. 
[03:09:00]  And if you find out you're lying and you're trying to come up with some weird character, you're so gone, man.  No, no.  Not at, not at all.  Doesn't fuck a guy.  You can, you can call, you can call my, like, my friend or whatever and he'll, he'll say.  You're a cult leader?  My cult leader.  I, I don't know.  Yeah, you can call David Koresh.  My friends can attest to this and, uh, my old high school chums and I've just never really.  Chums.  Chums.  No wonder you're getting laid.  Fucking chums.  Fucking just came in from a time machine.  My old chums.  That's true.  This is Marty Fry, you fucking asshole.  All right, Adam, you gotta give us something. 
[03:09:30]  Something's going on with you.  So what is it?  I don't, I, I guess I'm just, uh, I get really nervous and I just, uh, I don't, I don't know how to, uh, to seal the deal.  I've had opportunities.  Don't, don't get me wrong.  Oh, you've never kissed a girl.  No, because.  Where's the vagina opening at?  If you was going to finger pop a girl, what would you do?  I, show me what you would do.  Like, where's the pussy hole?  The pussy hole would be, like, probably in the middle of the, uh, vaginal.  Where the zipper is?  Yes.  He's just fucking lying.  I have no idea. 
[03:10:00]  This cocksucker is fucking lying, I'm telling you, man.  You think he's got, he's got like fucking 50 bitches.  You think he's just fucking everything?  He's, he's, this guy's not a virgin.  This is a fucking, this is a character.  Show on yourself where you would put a finger to put it up a pussy.  Go ahead.  He's reaching all over the place.  He's so full of shit, this motherfucker.  He's reaching all over.  Are you being a fucking comedian?  No, I'm not. 
[03:10:30]  You couldn't even exist being a virgin like this.  Liking pussy and being what, you just.  Can we get a girl, any girls nearby that will willingly open kiss Adam?  He's a good looking dude.  He's not like a fucking, a mess.  He's not, that's why I can't figure it out.  Did you kiss a girl today, Adam?  For the ONA show, anything.  Mm-hmm.  Would you kiss a guy?  No.  You said anything.  You just said it, like a second ago.  That is a good point.  What happened?  I'm not, I'm not going to kiss a guy.  What happened to anything for the ONA show?  That's more material for the guys behind the scenes to rip on me, because I'm like, there's 
[03:11:00]  a tar, I'm like the bottom bitch in the intern pool.  It's been a real dry well so far, Adam.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Well, Adam, what are you going to, you got to admit something here.  Something's going on.  Something got you going down this road.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, this is so unacceptable for a 22-year-old to just be saying what he's saying.  And he's using the word chum.  Yeah.  What's your favorite video to jerk off to?  And don't say you don't know.  Mine is taboo, too.  It's incest.  Go.  Your turn. 
[03:11:30]  Taboo.  You know, I would probably say the, I like the MILF Hunter series.  Okay.  Yeah.  So is your mother very strict?  Oh, shit.  You just, ooh.  Go ahead, Norton.  I'm sorry.  No, that's fine.  That's all I had on that.  This is a nice dig here.  This is very interesting.  The MILF thing.  MILF.  That's right.  Religion, MILF.  This is the male carry.  Get in your closet.  We'll see your dirty pillars. 
[03:12:00]  I'll see your dirty pillars.  And your daddy's fingers all over me.  Oh.  And his whiskey breath.  She was digging that shit.  He just might be asexual or something.  I don't know.  What does that mean?  Asexual is like, almost like Louis Ferranda from Caroline.  He's like, you can't picture Louis fucking anybody.  Even though Louis says he's gay, you can't picture him fucking anybody.  Right, he's not.  He's just, yeah.  He just loves walking his dog.  There's just no interest in general.  You like that shit?  MILF?  Well, you know, I think the guy's pretty funny.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  All right. 
[03:12:30]  The dude's sense of humor.  Jesus.  You're watching MILF Hunters because the guy's funny.  Yeah, what's funny about him?  You can rent Pryor live in concert from the 78, but you want to have a laugh as a comic  so you're going to have MILF Hunters?  What makes him funny?  He has a big freckle on his prick or something?  No, what I'm trying to do is that the past couple years I've been trying to do...  Whoa, look at it.  Look at it.  You ever see the movie True Romance?  I'm sitting here eating Chinese food, big titties, and a pussy on the screen.  And I'm saying to myself, you're a crazy motherfucker. 
[03:13:00]  If you sit and eat my Chinese food and look at the pussy on the screen, then you ain't doing  neither.  That's fucking great.  This motherfucker, Charlie Bronson.  Charlie Bronson.  That's this motherfucker.  That was great.  So why is the guy funny in the MILF Hunter series?  Because he, you know, his little...  Put some more pussy up there, Dan.  Just put some kind of funky-ass pussy some kind of way.  Go ahead.  I just think his whole, the way he tries to act and everything, I think it's quite comical. 
[03:13:30]  This motherfucker is giving him an Oscar.  We're talking about pussy, man.  I don't even know who's in this series.  Let me just talk about pussy in general.  As far as it goes, you know, I've been trying new things over the years, like trying to  get outside my box.  I'm really shy.  I'm real reflexive.  Well, get into one.  Yes.  And I'm just, I'm trying, you know.  I've been...  What do you do to try?  You know, I try to talk on the train or if I see him, you know, if I'm in the gym, I'll 
[03:14:00]  go talk to him.  What do you say?  I'll go, you know, I do yoga, so...  Oh, boy.  This is the real life AJ Poopy shits.  Yeah.  Who are we kidding?  So there's normally a girl doing yoga with me in the gym, and I always, you know, start  up a conversation, and then I go to a Bikram yoga class, and there's like, I'm one of two  guys in there.  Bikram. 
[03:14:30]  Bikram, yeah.  Can we bring a girl in?  Just to talk.  Just to talk.  You don't have to kiss him or nothing.  I want to see if this guy has any technique whatsoever.  Bring a girl in.  All right.  Who's this?  Right.  Hi.  How are you?  Hello.  Hey, almost Bonnie McFarland.  Wow.  What's your name?  She's just wearing a Bonnie hat.  Wow.  You're Kelly?  Shelly.  Hi, Shelly. 
[03:15:00]  And you get to try out for the last comic standing thing, car crash comedy.  Very cool.  Don't worry.  We just need you as kind of a prop.  Sure.  I mean, you can play along a little bit.  There you go, Adam.  You're in the gym.  Okay.  And Shelly's nearby.  Let's see your technique.  Did we just get done with yoga?  Or, you know, maybe you were spotting me while I was benching, like, 95 pounds or something.  But that was a joke.  Oh, well, thanks for telling us.  It's always the best way to tell a joke.  Just identify it as such after. 
[03:15:30]  Continue to point those out to us so we know what they are.  Well, I'd be like, hey, what's up?  How's it going?  Good stuff today?  Yeah.  Good what stuff?  Good stuff.  How are you doing?  Working out?  You seem to be...  Where are you from?  All right.  I see why this is not going to work.  Holy mother of God.  I'm going to go with the point you made a little while ago where you're just trying to talk to girls in general on the subway and the gym and stuff.  So let's...  Look, here's a girl.  Fuck the gym and make them believe you're somewhere.  Here's a girl right in front of you. 
[03:16:00]  Just start talking to her.  Here's the deal, though.  The last girl I talked to on the train, like, at the end when we got off the stop, she actually tried to recruit me for her pyramid scheme.  Like, I thought she was into me, but she gave me her card.  It's fucking hilarious.  It was pretty...  It was pretty...  Like, I was pretty sad.  You're a scam artist, Doreen.  Yeah.  You really are.  Yeah.  Okay, she's right in front of you.  Okay.  Why...  You know, you can just ask about...  Whatever.  Just talk to her.  You're both comics.  You have that in common.  Right.  Right.  So you're a comic? 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, I think we just established that.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, you know, watch the game last...  What did you do last night for the game?  Anything?  Well, the game was Sunday.  Yeah.  But I did watch it.  She came here more attached to the moment than you, and you've been in here how long?  Right.  Right.  Just calm down.  Sorry.  It's okay.  Don't be nervous.  I'm just a...  Calm down.  I'm just a train wreck.  Let me ask you a question, though.  Are you talking to her?  What's your goal?  Yeah.  My goal?  Because when I talk to a girl, my goal, no matter what it is, is to give some pussy as  soon as I possibly can. 
[03:17:00]  So all my lies are moving towards...  I'm thinking 17 steps ahead.  I'm thinking of 16 no's.  So I can get to a 17th yes for her to run out of reason and say no.  So what is your fucking goal in this?  Fucking Patrice.  My goal...  Do you want some pussy?  Maybe, yeah.  He doesn't want to put this...  Go, go!  Maybe a number.  Maybe a number.  Are you having a conversation in general?  In general?  Are you having a good conversation in general? 
[03:17:30]  Maybe meeting another person?  Another moral move you're making.  You want to meet a fucking nice person.  All right, let's get back to this scenario.  Let's go.  Just let him freestyle here.  Go ahead.  But what's he doing, Opie?  That's the beauty of it.  We don't know.  Yeah, we don't know.  Let's try to figure it out together.  And not what's he doing, but why is he doing it?  That's the beauty.  Let him just be freestyle for like a minute.  We'll try to stay quiet.  All right, so...  Well, most of us will be quiet.  Ah, man, I'm pretty sore from this workout.  I work out heavily. 
[03:18:00]  What do you...  How many times do you come to the gym?  Like three.  Three?  So you're pretty into working out and everything and staying healthy?  That's cool.  Okay.  You know, where are you...  Where are you from?  I'm from Texas.  Texas, wow.  Wow.  What are you doing in this gym here?  Oh, two things come from Texas.  I'm working out.  Really?  Yeah.  Well...  Yeah. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, she's in the gym because she's working out.  What do you think?  She's got a little...  A tad of Winona Ryder, too.  Do you hear that?  No, I'm sorry.  No?  And Jimmy.  And Jimmy Durante.  A little tad of Winona Ryder.  You ever hear that?  Holy...  No?  And a little Alice Cramden.  Which is cool because I always thought she was kind of hot.  Way to smooth it over.  Yeah.  All right, Adam.  He's like two backhanded compliments.  No, no, no.  They're not backhanded. 
[03:19:00]  But you know what?  To be honest, though, she's being very...  How women are.  She's being funky because she's thinking about him trying to fuck her.  Right.  But he's basically having a conversation.  So could you have a conversation with a dude that's really not trying to fuck you?  Maybe it'll be freeing.  For you.  Okay.  All right, go ahead.  Because you assume you have 17 lies.  Yeah.  And you got...  No, I have 17.  Right, we assume you have 17.  And that's the girl shit.  Of course.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead, Adam.  I got to say no 16.  So what kind of things do you like to do, you know, outside the gym?  It's an interview.  Exactly, by the way. 
[03:19:30]  I was in L.A.  Excuse my interruption.  Ant and his girlfriend and somebody else was in the jacuzzi.  And I was rapping with this girl.  And I'm the worst.  I'm like, you are.  And at the end, the answer girl goes, it sounded like you were interviewing her.  Yeah.  Like, I just asked questions.  The interview doesn't work good.  Yes.  I felt uncomfortable doing it.  Talk about...  Just talk about shit.  Tell her her fucking hat is cute.  Exactly.  Tell her to buy a newspaper.  Not just questions.  Don't just fucking...  Yeah, you fucking extra from Newsies. 
[03:20:00]  That's great.  That's right.  Joe Lewis wins.  X-Tree, X-Tree, X-Tree.  Do it if he's Truman.  I'll pay for that.  Well, yeah, that's...  I would like to say that is a lovely, lovely wardrobe you have on there.  Lovely wardrobe?  That is a fine chapeau.  Can you say something that might give her some type of emotion, whether it be hatred or...  Yeah, you got maybe a little compliment that doesn't seem like you're throwing a compliment out there. 
[03:20:30]  Like, do something.  Right.  Fucking do something.  I would like to take that golfer's cap and put my bagger in that vance.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I don't really know what to say to that.  You didn't do that.  You didn't just say that.  I tried to be out there.  Say this.  You're out around me.  You're definitely out.  In the douche-sphere.  Say this.  I can't win.  No, just say this.  Say this, right?  Just say something and move it along in some direction.  Just go, you know what? 
[03:21:00]  Just say it just like this.  You know what?  You look like you don't shave your pussy.  Wow.  Say it.  I bet you don't shave your pussy.  Say that to her.  Well, I...  No, no, no.  I bet you don't shave your pussy.  I bet you don't...  No.  I bet you don't shave your pussy.  I bet you don't shave your pussy.  What the fuck did you just say to me?  I guarantee you don't shave your pussy.  I guarantee you don't shave your pussy.  Oh, really?  Really?  And you're an expert?  Yeah.  There you go.  Nigga!  Now, do you see what's happening? 
[03:21:30]  Do you do it to you?  Yeah.  She's like, oh, yeah?  Yeah, she goes, oh, yeah?  And you go, yeah?  You just look like your pussy's all filthy.  Oh, fuck.  Nice.  She's gonna be mad.  Then you can flip it.  Do something.  Flip it.  Wow.  Patrice is fucking Obi-Wan Kenobi a pussy.  Oh, yeah?  And you're an expert?  You damn right.  If you need your pussy shave, I'm the man to call, bitch.  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  Stay arrogant. 
[03:22:00]  God damn.  Let's hear some arrogance.  Let's go.  All right.  Say, I'm better than you.  All right.  Yo, bitch, I'm better than you.  Yo, where you from?  Yo.  Really?  Really, yo?  I'm from Detroit.  D-Town.  The D.  This nigga here.  Bitches be off the chains.  Really?  Really?  I keep my bitches on a leash.  Oh, he blew it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Damn, you goofy motherfucker.  You almost had it.  I don't know.  I have no idea how to talk. 
[03:22:30]  I don't know how to do that.  Evoke something.  Yeah, you are an awkward man.  But what do you want?  I am.  What do I want?  I don't think he doesn't like girls.  No, I don't think he likes girls.  He's like a Tom girl.  Do you have any sisters?  Do you have any?  I have a younger sister.  Have you ever been around girls?  I have a younger sister.  When you were a little kid, did you like a girl who fucking made you feel stupid or something?  You know, I had a crush on a girl for like a long time and then things kind of hit the fan.  What's hitting?  How long?  Hitting the fan?  You never kissed her.  Well, like, you know. 
[03:23:00]  How does it hit the fan?  I don't know.  Is anybody paying attention to his vernacular things hit the fan?  I'm pretty good at reading people.  This is what I think is going on.  Adam's gay.  No.  And his dad certainly would not approve of that.  That's right.  And so he's trying to work the pussy.  Baby.  I can argue with him.  That is my observation right here.  So you think he'd be better at working the cock?  He would probably, yeah.  Yeah.  He would be.  All his fingers just got so tight. 
[03:23:30]  They all just set up real straight.  Oh, really?  Wait.  He would be very comfortable with the cock, but.  How long did you like this girl for?  I want to know how long you liked this girl for.  What was her name?  She was.  First name.  Oh, boy.  Her name was Jessie.  You know.  Her name was Jessie?  Of course it was.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  Jessie, you hit that shit on her name.  Oh, shit.  I got this one.  And we were.  What color hair?  She had brown hair.  I wish that I had Jessie's balls. 
[03:24:00]  What was her favorite song?  Her favorite.  I don't know her favorite song.  How big was her cock?  She didn't know.  But we were.  You know, I kind of had it like a little.  How can I find a scrotum like that?  Jessie.  So how long did you like this girl, Jessie?  It was about two years.  And where did she live?  She lived in my area.  Where was that?  In Commerce, Michigan.  All right.  So in Michigan, Jessie from Michigan. 
[03:24:30]  Yes.  Was she the governor?  No.  No.  Last name.  Last name.  Last name.  Last name.  Last name.  Last name.  Garner.  That sounds like a made-up goddamn name if I ever heard one.  No, I'm going to get killed for saying this on the air.  Jessie Jessieman.  And, you know, I.  Jessie is a guy's name, too, by the way.  Of course it is.  Okay, yeah.  And, you know, I think. 
[03:25:00]  I thought we had some chemistry going.  And, you know, it just didn't work out.  I found Jessie Turner's homepage.  I'm going to get killed for this.  That's James Caan.  You had chemistry, but you never kissed her.  Well, it was really awkward because she was a co-worker of mine.  And, you know, I didn't really know how to go about it.  And I took her out to a couple of Tiger games to a couple of meals of food. 
[03:25:30]  How can you expect?  Meals of food?  Food.  All right.  You never fuck a girl after a Tiger game.  No.  Suck it because Cecil Fielder doubled.  I don't know.  I just.  We were cool at work, but then, like, outside of work, I was just awkward.  I just didn't know what to do. 
[03:26:00]  You were cool.  This is the story of a 35-year-old man.  He's 22.  Yeah.  I met at work.  He had this amazing.  Come on, man.  We got to get a girl for you to make out with.  Is there any girls that are willing to take one for the team?  Not right now.  No, you don't?  How old are you?  I'm 28.  You're 28?  I'm too old.  What do you mean?  You don't want anything.  I'm not going to train that.  You don't want anything to do with him, do you?  Sorry.  You don't look 28 at all.  Oh, thanks.  You get carded a lot.  Physically, is he okay, though? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, no.  Hey, if I were 28 or 18.  What do you think?  I mean, if he came at you with some sort of something, would it be, you know, whatever?  Yeah, it's a possibility.  She winced first.  She went, uh.  What's your hunch on this guy?  I think somebody nailed it earlier when they said it's an act.  Oh, I'm a virgin.  No.  Oh, my penis is alone.  It's like, oh, okay.  All right, we're going to get a girl in here.  I would really.  A little make-out session on the couch.  I want to see.  I don't think anyone's that good. 
[03:27:00]  Like, he's too good to be acting like this.  You think it's too natural?  Yeah.  Yeah, possibly.  I don't know.  I can't read it.  I'm not 100% sure.  Somebody said that about Kaisa Sosa, too, by the way.  He said he's going to take off his glasses.  20-20 vision.  Then you got to flop his big dick out and start fucking girls on the street.  The greatest trick that Adam ever pulled was convincing this radio show to put him on.  Let's go to Sam.  Sam's got something on Adam.  Whether it's an act or not, he's completely psychotic because he doesn't. 
[03:27:30]  It won't drop.  He will not drop it.  So if it is an act.  Drop what?  If it's an act, I'm saying.  Oh.  It doesn't drop.  So it's like the movie The Prestige where the magicians live their life.  Yes.  He's gone through so many questions from me trying to figure out if it's an act or not  and cultivating this thing.  Oh, okay.  So he might be like one of those guys that thinks it's Andy Kaufman intriguing to not  drop the Tony Clifton.  Exactly.  Okay.  I think he's the real deal. 
[03:28:00]  Either way.  Yeah, I would say he's the real deal.  Smell his dick.  No guys like this.  They just have no rapport with women.  No real interest in women.  I guess the jacking off is just purely a biological function.  Feeling like he's got to just get rid of it.  Yeah.  What do you like about a woman?  You know, I like a good personality.  Physically?  Physically.  What do you like?  Tits, ass, man?  What are you?  It doesn't really.  As long as she, you know, is talking to me and making eye contact with me, I'm just 
[03:28:30]  not into whales.  That's it.  But what about a woman?  Do you, you know?  What about a woman?  Do you like her tits?  The, you know.  Hot abs?  You know, I like, I like legs.  Hot stomach?  I like legs, the eyes, you know, a nice looking face.  What do you like about the eyes?  You know, just nice eyes.  What do you like about the legs?  The legs, just strong runner's legs, you know.  Like men?  Oh, like a man's legs?  Fair enough. 
[03:29:00]  Athletic?  Athletic!  Hairy asses?  Yes.  Yeah, Travis pointed out, you haven't pointed out any features that guys don't have.  You're right.  Excellent.  Hey, baby, you got delicious pecs.  You like women's pecs?  Strong forearms.  You know, I'm an ass guy, I'm a boob guy, I'm whatever, like, I'm whatever, you know.  A-cups and a mom tattoo on her fucking forearms?  I'll agree, he has an ass and a boob.  Ha ha ha. 
[03:29:30]  Ha ha ha.  What?  You, uh, you're an odd sort.  Yeah, we're just scratching the surface.  Yeah.  We gotta move on, because we got these guys.  I understand.  They're waiting to do some comedy.  This is a good one.  We'll have Adam back on the show very soon.  Yes, we will.  Like tomorrow.  Some of the girls that are thinking about coming over to check out the show live, we  need one of you to make out with Adam tomorrow.  You seem like a clean guy, you don't have any diseases or anything, right?  I couldn't.  How clean?  Exactly.  All right.  We'll get you on the couch and see what you can get done.  Unless there's some acute personality disease. 
[03:30:00]  He's got something wrong with his personality.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you, man?  I don't know.  I don't really know.  I was kind of, uh...  I don't know.  You realize there is something, all right?  He's uncomfortable in his own skin, this guy.  When are you at your happiest and your most...  When are you king of your fucking entire space?  Probably when I'm at the batting cages.  With something big and long and hard.  And balls swinging.  Balls and sticks.  Everything got to do with balls and sticks.  And a pitcher and a catcher. 
[03:30:30]  And I'm beating a cat.  And I'm beating a cat to death.  Anything that has to do with pussy.  I'm killing fish.  I just...  I really like...  I like baseball.  And I just like to go to the cages, like, once a week.  Just to...  Let off some steam.  Just to take a couple cuts.  Let off a little steam, right?  Well, you know, I just love baseball.  You got built up energy there, man?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's, like, your passion.  That's...  I... 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  I love...  I just like baseball and crosswords and reading a lot.  And, you know, doing research.  You know?  So...  Research on what?  Well, I kind of...  I kind of...  Research.  I kind of...  He's a dick expert.  He does research.  He's a big dick expert.  If you jerk off to it, it's probably not research.  He understands helmets.  Well, I...  I want to...  I want to write a...  Write a book in the future about... 
[03:31:30]  Dicks.  Not about dicks.  Not about dicks.  What about...  What about, you know, baseball journalism and the history of it and why it's just crumbling  today?  And I...  Why do you think it's crumbling today?  Because of cocks.  There's not enough cocks in everybody's mouth.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Get Derek in here.  We rarely hear from Derek.  Oh, Derek.  If Derek comes in, it's usually something good. 
[03:32:00]  We rarely hear from Derek.  Derek was creeped out by Adam today.  Derek is slight of build.  Coincidentally, um...  Derek.  Here's our pal, Derek.  He's never on mic.  Derek's lost.  He's a sweet boy.  Yeah.  Derek's a good guy.  Hey, what natural disaster did you lose your shoulders in?  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  The guy just comes in here once in a balloon.  That's why he doesn't want to be blindsided. 
[03:32:30]  He's dressed like he's in dead poet society.  He'd rather be behind the scenes because of this very reason.  Derek, what happened with Adam today?  Um, I came in.  He came in and got my breakfast sword in the morning, and then when he, you know, brought  it back from the deli, he stood there in the corner and started asking me how my day  was going, if I was having a good day, as I was trying to get work done.  Well, that's interesting.  What's that about?  It's just a little cute.  That's funny how that's uncomfortable, though, for a man. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, fuck yeah.  How are you today, fan?  What?  Shut up.  I'll kill you, motherfucker.  I would say just about every guy listening to us would never ask another guy how his days  going.  No, no, not out of the blue like that.  That's, um, you know.  Why did you do that, Adam?  I was just trying to, you know, I saw Derek for the first time.  Hey, Derek.  Nice day today.  Gave him my change and...  Suck your dick.  Head off.  No?  Do you want to have sex with Derek?  I don't, um, don't want... 
[03:33:30]  If you could have sex with any guy that you work with in here, who would it be?  Any...  I'm not going to answer that.  Just pick one.  Just pick one.  Any guy.  One of the guys in here that works here.  It's all fancy.  Who would it be?  Saeed.  Holy shit.  Just get this motherfucker.  That speaks volumes.  No, I, you know, he's...  I just...  Saeed?  Saeed?  I just put it out there because I knew that he'd react like that.  All right, here's Saeed.  What?  Yes?  Let's see if Saeed's flattered by this.  Saeed? 
[03:34:00]  Saeed?  We haven't talked to you in a while.  I am rather disgusted by Adam's choice by having sex with me.  Saeed the poor man Sanjay.  Now, why does that kind of disgust you?  He's just so strange.  It's not your type?  Today, he was talking to me about, like, giving up pussy and stuff, and I just couldn't believe  it.  What was he saying?  He was saying that back in college, when he was in college, that he had so many chances  getting laid and, like, getting handjobs and shit.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  Handjobs? 
[03:34:30]  But he couldn't do it because I was just too nervous.  I'm assuming he's gay, right?  I don't know.  Are you gay?  No, I'm not.  I don't believe it, but do me a favor.  Can you have a conversation with her in general?  Just a general conversation?  Just have one, like he was.  What's your name?  I'm Shelly.  What's your name?  Saeed.  What do you do?  I just have a day job.  I work secretary type stuff.  Nice.  Yeah, I'm here.  My sister is a secretary.  Yeah.  Basically it.  It's not great. 
[03:35:00]  He's got to be gay, man.  It's too much S's.  It sounds like the fucking T is ready in this motherfucker right here.  He's escaping.  Are you not gay?  Are you serious?  I'm positive.  You're not lying.  I have a girlfriend, yes.  Really?  Yes.  I know you've been accused of being gay before, without a doubt, right?  Yeah, totally.  Fair enough, man.  But in high school, I was the faggot.  It's something with the speech, really. 
[03:35:30]  It's something with the speech.  Your S's come out very effeminate.  And the hand on the hip, and the tight jeans.  And the tight jeans.  And the tight jeans are definitely.  There's just something going on.  What's your girlfriend's name?  Jessie?  Laura.  Yeah, Laura.  You dress like a runaway girl in Seattle.  And the common denominator here is Steve hired all these guys, so. 
[03:36:00]  Yes, of course.  Steve did it.  It's wonderful.  I just want to be surrounded by boys.  Steve holds up a picture of pussy, and whoever goes, ugh, you're hired.  Oh, my God.  All right, well.  Saeed has heard all this before, so.  What do you think of Adam?  Yeah, what's your assessment? 
[03:36:30]  I'm.  I really don't know what to say, because I'm just so confused about him.  But I really.  Him?  I feel like this beat you in a closet, make you come out of it.  I'm like, fucking.  Saeed is making me uncomfortable.  There's no words can tell how strange he is.  He's strange, huh?  Yeah.  That's what I'm getting over and over again.  You're just a weirdo.  He's such a shooter, dude.  I'd say you don't fucking push him in front of someone. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, you think he's one of those.  He's a shooter, dude.  You like guns?  No, I don't.  I'm a pacifist.  Oh, okay.  Have you been watching him as people, you know, just his.  Yeah, yeah.  As he's standing there, listening.  Very uncomfortable.  Very, very strange kid, man.  I don't think he's violent, though, because he wants to perform.  And performers very rarely, you know, he's not isolated.  He's a performer, he's open, does comedy, danced on television.  So he gets it out a little bit.  He doesn't just isolate and not talk to anybody. 
[03:37:30]  All right.  Dr. Norton, thank you.  That's why I don't think he's.  All right.  I think you're the type of idiot that accidentally kills the hooker at the bachelor party.  He's just trying to prove you like pussy so much that you just hit him with a sofa.  Fucking ottoman across his skull.  See, guys, it's hot.  All right.  He's dead.  Thanks.  Bombs are flying.  People are dying.  Children are crying.  Politicians are lying, too. 
[03:38:00]  Cancer is killing.  Texaco is spilling.  The whole world's gone to hell, but how are you?  I'm super.  Thanks for asking.  All things considered, I couldn't be better, I must say.  I'm feeling super.  Now nothing bugs me.  Everything is super when you're...  Don't you think I look cute in this habit?  I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple, but I just can't feel too bad for you right now. 
[03:38:30]  Because I'm feeling so insanely super, that even the fact that you can't walk can't bring me down.  Hey, super.  Thanks for asking.  All things considered, it could be better, I must say.  I'm super.  No nothing bugs me.  Everything is super when you're just.  You think I look cute in this habit?  These little pants are just matching time that I got at fire.  I'm super.  You think I look cute in the barracks and the trenches as well?  Stick them up.  He can't be awesome to us in town. 
[03:39:00]  Skittles.  Yes, he's super and he's about to be bad.  Okay.  Everything is super when you're just.  Yeah.  When you're dead.  Obi and Anthony.  Obi and Anthony.  And now, the worst of Obi and Anthony.  The, uh, Obi and Anthony show.  Uh, I got a note.  It just said, Obi, it was in an envelope. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, that's mysterious.  We've had such a busy, uh, show here at XM.  Finally opened it during the break.  It says, Obi, please do us a favor and tell your weird intern, Adam, who we met, uh, yesterday.  Yes, we did.  For the first time, we kind of brought him to everyone's attention for the most part yesterday.  Not to pull up a chair uncomfortably close to the glass outside the studio and then sit there and stare at us while we're doing our show.  It creeps us out.  Thanks, Ron and Fez.  Holy shit. 
[03:40:00]  Does anyone have anything on this?  Isn't he getting us in Dutch with our favorite show?  If I may use those words.  I thought in Dutch was good.  I don't know what that means.  No, it's bad, right?  No.  Getting you in Dutch.  In Dutch is good.  No, it's bad.  I'm telling you, he's in Dutch.  I bet it, Jimmy.  What?  In Dutch is good.  When you say, I'm in Dutch with somebody, doesn't it mean you're bad with them?  I can't even acknowledge that a grown man would think it means good.  It's good.  I'm telling you right now, in Dutch means good.  It means bad.  No, it doesn't.  Google it. 
[03:40:30]  You're going to be in Dutch.  Please.  It means trouble.  I don't think it does.  I know you don't.  You'll be in Dutch.  Yeah.  Anthony's going to Google you.  He's in Dutch with you.  It means bad.  You're the epitome of foolishness.  You'll be in Dutch with the audience as they call you a blithering idiot.  You're a horse's ass personified.  You're the personification of stupidity.  I feel like I'm in Dutch with the show.  You guys blew my great Google joke.  What was the Google joke?  I heard.  Well, fucking Vinny goes to Anthony, Google it.  And I said, no, Anthony wants to Google your daughters. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, jeez.  I'm hurtful.  It's hurtful.  Well, we have a rule never to do the same joke twice, but I just can't help myself.  I was proud of that line.  It's a rule.  Anyway, here's Adam.  Adam, you're creeping out Ron and Fez.  What happened yesterday?  Well, the bleachers were moved in here, and the chairs were also out there as well to  make room for the bleachers, and I was waiting because the bin was in here, and I was just 
[03:41:30]  sitting there watching their show.  From uncomfortably close to the glass, apparently.  Did they point this out during their show?  They didn't point it out.  Well, Mr. Bennington kind of stared at me, but, you know, I...  You are an odd fellow.  You're a little bit weird.  In Dutch, you got it?  Well, this wacky source, Merriam-Webster, has in Dutch means, quote, in disfavor or in  trouble.  Okay.  It's bad. 
[03:42:00]  Fuck.  How do you think it meant good?  What do you mean it's good?  I don't know.  As opposed to good?  Yeah.  What's double Dutch?  All right.  Adam.  Yes.  So, you're noticing he's a little weird, right, Vinny?  He is definitely a little odd.  It's an accent.  What is that?  Why were you staring at the Ron and Fez show?  I was waiting for the bin, and I was waiting for them to go to break, and I was just, you  know, lounging casually on the chair, like, just normally.  Reminds me of an Adam Sandler character. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  You really do.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, Sam, you got anything on this?  Oh, man.  He's even weirder.  Holy shit.  Ron and Fez actually wrote a note.  Art Garfunkel's kid.  He wrote a note.  I apologize to Ron and Fez that I creeped them out, and I won't do it again.  So, are you going to tell us your deep, dark secret yet?  What?  No.  I don't even know.  Touched by a priest?  No.  No.  My priest and I are, you know, pretty cool.  I started thinking about it yesterday, because I... 
[03:43:00]  I went on record and said, I think you're gay and you don't know, but I'm not even thinking  that anymore.  I'm thinking that something happened to you.  I'm going with Molestation now.  Yeah, it could be.  No.  I'm going with Molestation.  Molestation.  Well, Vinny, he's a virgin.  He's 22.  22.  Has never kissed a girl.  Never kissed a girl?  Have you thought about playing a nerdy zombie for George Romero?  You've never kissed a girl ever? 
[03:43:30]  No.  Do you want to?  I've had chances, but they're really awkward, and I kind of like...  I've had chances.  Always awkward.  You have to make that move.  They're a little awkward.  They're a little awkward.  I just...  Sometimes it gets a little awkward when I kiss a girl.  It gets a little awkward.  No, I'm just kind of socially...  You hit it right on the head.  I'm socially awkward and maybe socially retarded.  Were you Molest? 
[03:44:00]  No.  No.  Are you sure?  I'm positive.  But something's going on.  Yeah, something's definitely happening.  I'm not thinking the gay thing anymore, because I really went home and thought about this one.  I'm thinking Molestation.  He has a made-up girlfriend.  Did you go to the high school prom?  Did you go to the prom?  I didn't go to any dances.  That doesn't shock me.  I don't like to dance.  Well, no.  A lot of times I played sports, and I had a job after practice, and I just worked and did my own thing.  Loving parents?  What sport were you in? 
[03:44:30]  Were you in track?  Cross-country, baseball, basketball.  Cross-country, baseball, basketball.  That's a weird sport.  I can't even see you playing basketball.  That must be hard to play.  Cross-country, I believe.  Baseball, I can...  Yeah, basketball.  You know, I was like...  Ball boy?  I was like the 10th guy.  I was the water boy.  I'm going to guess something.  For the football team.  I want to guess something else.  Your parents are not together anymore, right?  No, my parents are married, and I'm...  In a lovingly way still?  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  I got a little sister, and she's cool. 
[03:45:00]  Spaghetti against the wall when you were growing up, nothing like that?  No American beauty stuff.  Did you ever...  Did your father ever talk to you about girls?  Like, inside, you know, you gotta get laid?  Yeah, did your dad ever talk about...  Ah, pussy.  My dad, my dad...  Yeah.  Well, my dad was kind of like...  He was kind of like the ladies' man back in his day.  Another SNL character?  The ladies' man.  I think he...  Like a karmatic payback.  Yes, and I think that he's kind of...  You know, he understands that, you know, I'm having troubles. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, no.  And he, you know, he gives me like...  Of course he is.  He raised an inept fruit.  Yeah.  Sorry, I was joking about that, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going back to gay.  Now I'm going back to gay.  What does your dad do for a living?  He works at Ford.  Yeah, he's a man's man.  That's right.  He's a...  Modeling agents?  Selling trucks every day.  No, he works on the assembly lines.  I heard it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And he's a manly.  He's...  Yeah, he's quite...  A little King of Scotland stuff going on here? 
[03:46:00]  Nothing.  No.  No, hold on.  What did you mean?  In other words, like the father was so...  Boo.  Boo.  Oh, shut up.  No.  I really don't like you.  What do you mean, boo?  Puddle of AIDS from Jersey writes, I heard Adam is dating George Glass.  Oh, yeah.  Are you dating George Glass?  That's my boyfriend, George Glass.  No.  No, huh?  No.  But I...  When are you going to give up your secret?  Something happened to you.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  I'm just very, very inept. 
[03:46:30]  Never kiss a girl at 22 is bizarre.  Inept people don't realize they're inept, is what it is.  They're just inept.  Like, you're saying you're inept and you're a social misfit and you just don't know how  to act around girls.  Yeah.  You should be able to turn that around, you know?  Keep your chin up.  Yeah.  But you can't.  You're part of a successful radio show.  I am.  Pussy flying through the doors in this place.  What do you do?  Yeah.  All right.  By that, I mean cocks. 
[03:47:00]  Do you have any girl that you want to date right now?  I can see a girl around the other guy.  I want to date that girl.  No.  No.  There was one back in the day I had a big crush on and she kind of...  Wednesday.  Yeah.  She kind of, like, rejected me.  Ah, that's it.  But that's not...  How is mom?  That's it.  You have to get used to that.  You have to get used to that feeling and get past it.  Norton did.  And now he's got a girlfriend.  Yeah.  You've got to get past the rejection thing.  Well, I am past that, but that was, like, the only girl that I liked. 
[03:47:30]  Hold on.  Don't do it.  You raised the girlfriend example.  You're right.  I did get past it.  Now I have a girlfriend.  Stay where you are.  You're better off.  You're better off jerking off into a napkin and crying yourself to sleep.  Trust me, kid.  Can I jump in here?  Hector V is sticking up for me and I appreciate it.  I'm pissed.  Opie pointed out the Adam Sandler thing yesterday.  Sorry, Opie.  Guess you're right.  Just a button pusher.  Yeah, half the time, these guys don't listen to what I have to say because they don't think  I'm actually going to say anything that's relevant to me.  What happened?  Who doesn't listen? 
[03:48:00]  Pretty much everybody.  What happened?  That's not true.  You say things at weird times.  Like, if I don't hear something, I didn't hear it.  Like, it's not to be a dick.  I brought up the Adam Sandler thing yesterday.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  All right.  How come no one ever brought the Adam Sandler thing up before today?  I don't understand.  That was a fucking three's company joke.  All right, Adam, we're going to go home.  Yeah.  Because you're not ready to give up your dark secret.  I don't have any real secrets.  But there's something that puts you down this road where you haven't kissed a girl and you're 
[03:48:30]  22 years old.  What age was the big rejection by this girl you liked?  Everyone's been rejected by a girl, though.  By 22, you're doing some of that fucking.  It was, I mean, it was this summer.  You know, that was my...  Easy for you to say.  Was it like a vicious put down or did she just say no?  No, she just kind of, like, nodded her head and, like, it was really awkward and we kind  of just, like, parted ways and then... 
[03:49:00]  I got it.  I finally got it.  Very, very, very small dick.  No.  He said over six.  Yeah, but that was lied because he knows the average is six.  He's uncomfortable with his tiny, tiny little penis.  No, no.  Kind of like you almost have, like, an innie and you're like, you know what?  I better not kiss girls because I know where that might lead to.  And then I got to put my pants down and show them that I'm hung like an acorn.  Problem.  Problem.  Problem. 
[03:49:30]  Just...  Is that the problem?  Sure.  Small penis?  No, I have a...  You know...  Let's go around the room.  I'm going to say small penis.  Anthony, what do you think his issue is that he's 20...  Gay.  Gay?  Definitely.  I think he's just a shy fag with a small dick.  First base, second base, third base.  Over-domineering father.  Just an over-domineering guy.  Probably a good father.  His father's a ladies' man.  Probably played sports. 
[03:50:00]  Successful.  People respect him.  Fucking great Santini or something.  Or maybe an over-dominating mother who didn't like the fact that the father was a ladies' man  and so castrated this...  Ah.  That could be it.  Yeah, yeah.  Did the ration make you perform fellatio?  How did he sodomize you?  I don't know.  I'm just...  I'm kind of like my own worst enemy.  And, you know, I'm on...  Like I said before, I'm uncomfortable in my own skin.  And I need to try to work on that. 
[03:50:30]  Fucking sound like Adam Sandler.  You know?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  I didn't even notice that.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  All right.  And, Dan, you want to jump in?  You got a mic in front of you.  What do you think his issue is?  I just think he doesn't know how to act like a human being.  Like, he just...  Yeah.  Way to bring it home, Sam.  He doesn't know how to be a person.  Yeah.  He'll go for any reaction.  Like, any attention is good attention.  No matter what it is.  Were you a weirdo in school?  Like, in elementary school?  Were you the weirdo kid that everyone made fun of? 
[03:51:00]  No.  Why?  Were you student council president?  No.  Where were you?  I was a safety.  I'd crossed children through...  Oh, maybe the pedophiles.  No.  No.  I was...  Safety picture all.  You pat him on the ass going across the street.  He held up the stop sign, and he was fired for coming in his pants.  Hey, little boy.  Come here.  Your penis is my size.  No.  I was in high school.  I was really under the radar in middle school.  Weirdo. 
[03:51:30]  You've kissed infants.  Are you on drugs?  Was I...  Prescription, right now?  I don't take any drugs.  Don't drink.  Don't smoke.  Therapy?  Huh?  Don't drink.  Don't smoke.  You in therapy?  No.  I did a little bit of counseling back in the day.  Yeah?  Yeah.  For what?  What was this day?  Like, a couple years ago.  Oh.  And it was for what?  For depression.  Dude, you were a little depressed.  Well, you know, things were happening, and, you know... 
[03:52:00]  Things were happening.  Yeah.  What was happening?  Like, happening.  You know, some things in my life.  I...  You know, a couple people died, and...  Aw.  You know, I had to just...  You killed them?  No.  Cheezing, of course.  No.  Family members?  Who died?  Older?  One of my coaches from baseball.  Hilarious.  And, uh...  And my grandpa.  Aw.  Grandpa. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Who taught me the game of baseball.  So...  Aw.  It was a whole baseball death thing.  So, you know, it just, uh...  It was, uh...  It was, uh...  That was terrific.  That was terrific.  Was it traumatic for you when the scooter died?  Did you go in more and outside the money store?  I just got a note handed to me, and this is very creepy now that I think about it.  He has none of his own opinions. 
[03:53:00]  He agrees with anything.  Hmm.  You pretty much said yes to everything you've suggested.  He's elegant.  He's Earl.  He's the white Earl.  Thank you, E-Rock.  How'd your parents die?  Adam and Earl should get together and do a radio show.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  An awful, non-opinionated radio show.  So you went to therapy for the people dying?  You know, I just talked about it and kind of, you know, paved things out a little bit. 
[03:53:30]  You didn't talk about your, like, inability to get a girl or anything like that?  Uh, we, uh, we brushed over that issue.  Did your therapist touch you?  No, no.  He was a counselor.  He was a good guy.  Yeah.  I bet.  How old was your baseball coach that died?  Uh, he was, uh, 26.  Oh, how'd he go?  Uh, car accident, uh, blindsided by a semi.  Yeah, that sucks.  Hey, Charlie D. writes, uh, he suffers from, just updated, uh, he suffers from a loose anus. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, poor boy.  Poor thing.  Oh, come on.  Uh, but, uh, you know, uh, that's, that's, you know, that's, that's the past and I, I'm still, you know, still trying to, you know, go outside my box and do stuff that's, uh, do stuff that's fun and interesting.  I don't really, I don't really do much.  Let me ask you this.  If you, could you be with a girl?  Like if someone hired you a prostitute, could you do it? 
[03:54:30]  No.  No.  I don't, I don't, I wouldn't do that.  Why?  Well, because with all the STDs and stuff.  Sometimes you need to just get a little push, you know, you just.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Sometimes you need to just soar in your cock, kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I, I, I understand that.  What about, uh, like a hand job with a rubber?  Well, I, one of, one of, uh, one of my friends who, uh, who is a girl, she bought me a, uh, like one of those, uh, one of those mouths that, like.  One of those fuck mouths?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And, and that, I use it a couple times, uh. 
[03:55:00]  Why don't you say, instead of giving me the fuck mouth, how about I fuck your mouth?  Yeah, but I think that's the message a girl is sending.  Yeah, yeah.  A girl doesn't give you a fuck mouth if she doesn't want to.  It's like you're, you're starving and a chicken brings you a rubber chicken.  Well, hey, well, no, that could be that you're, uh, she, he wanted to fuck her and she goes, here, just do this, just do it with this.  Here, take this.  It'll listen to you afterwards, too.  Just talk to her.  Coke logic wants it. 
[03:55:30]  Yes, Coke logic.  Hey, Ant.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Did you guys notice that this guy sounds like Adam Sandler?  Ah, shit.  It does, man.  Wow, you know something?  I didn't even notice this whole time.  And his name's Adam.  Yes.  Yeah.  Amazing.  All right, Adam.  I got to go.  I got to go.  I was, I went to a counselor.  Oh.  Very, very depressed for one hour.  So you fuck, uh, mouths.  I tried it out once and then I was like, or once or twice. 
[03:56:00]  And then I was like, you know, this, this, all right.  And then I just put it in my closet and, you know, hopefully, uh, mom doesn't find it.  You live at, you live at, I was going to ask, you live at your parents?  Uh, no, um, I live, uh, I went to MSU and I lived with, uh, roommates and I'm living with  my aunt right now in New Rochelle.  They molest you?  No, no.  Okay.  Hopefully mom doesn't find it.  Hopefully dad doesn't find it and use it and then put it back without worshiping it.  Oh, is that, is that like it?  Uh, no, it's, it's a mouth.  Oh, that's a, this is a, this is a, this is a, uh, Eve's pussy. 
[03:56:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Eve's pussy.  You want to put your dick in it?  Uh, yeah.  I'll, uh, I, I, I, I, I, I'll, you know.  Test, test run it.  I'll give it a test run, you know.  All right, Adam, you're creeping everyone out.  Yeah, you're a weirdo.  You're definitely a weirdo.  Sorry, guys.  You're giving us the willies?  Yeah, just don't stare at Ron and Fess.  Yes, the heebie-jeebies.  I won't.  Please.  We have enough problems with those guys.  Speculation. 
[03:57:00]  Speculation threat.  Speculation threat.  That's not an act.  That's, I, we don't know.  We don't know.  We're really trying to figure it out.  He'd have to be a good actor because that's pretty good.  I kind of look at him.  Even just him walking.  Yeah, I don't think I've been acting.  Hey, this is Paul Stanley and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, the worst.  Just pathetic.  Of Opie and Anthony.  They call it toilet humor.  Toilet humor.  Can I ask you a quick question before we start this?  Oh, no.  Just as guys.  Oh, no.  If I do this signal, do you guys know what this means? 
[03:57:30]  If I look at you as an intern and I go, what does that mean?  I would say I want to enter a swimming competition in the Olympics.  I'm taking my two fingers, my point from my middle, and I'm chopping them like Pac-Man.  Right.  Like, if I looked at you and I said.  Yeah.  Actually, I would say I need some scissors.  Yeah.  That is the universal finger symbol for please bring me some scissors. 
[03:58:00]  I really thought you were asking for young intern cock.  I really did.  That would be I point to my mouth and I give a thumbs up.  Thank you.  But it wasn't me that asked for him.  I was imitating Jimmy.  How did you not know what this meant?  Well, you get on the mic.  You didn't know what this meant.  No, I did not.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  You think I was a Vulcan?  What could that mean?  Live long and prosper.  These guys are insane.  Adam came in really fast to give Jimmy scissors. 
[03:58:30]  And as Adam takes a mic, Danny runs around the room and hands out intern Adam fun facts.  Fun facts.  This is cool.  This would go on the back of his baseball card.  Can I read over my shoulder, please?  Thank you.  Sorry.  Oh, man.  Intern Adam fun facts.  Yes.  And here's one.  Yesterday, he spoke to the girl he had a crush on, Jessica, and admitted he's been in love with her for two years. 
[03:59:00]  That's an Adam fun fact.  Why couldn't we do this on the air?  Adam, you don't know how to do radio, man.  Why wouldn't you talk to her on the air?  Yeah, if you're going to talk to this girl and profess your love.  When did you talk to her?  What?  Is she on the air?  He apologized for being...  I have no idea.  Say that again.  Can I see your phone for a second?  He apologized for being an asshole.  We're getting Jessica on the phone?  Yes.  All right.  Sorry, Anthony.  Say what?  He apologized for being an asshole.  Okay.  Fun fact. 
[03:59:30]  After she told him she was upset with his behavior, he called her a bitch cunt.  Point Adam.  This was during the phone call yesterday?  Point Adam.  Yeah.  He says she's moving to Colorado with her boyfriend soon, and this could be the last conversation they have.  It's dramatic stuff.  Adam has admitted to some of his fellow interns that he is on probation for shoplifting, and that he is a kleptomaniac.  No. 
[04:00:00]  Wow.  What is that you just did?  Wow.  Don't do it again.  Have you shoplifted?  I have.  You have?  Yes.  And are you a kleptomaniac?  Sort of.  Did you take the cherries out of the refrigerator?  No.  No, absolutely not.  What I did, I went to Target.  And I pocketed some hand.  You should have bought one for your head.  That's right.  The Target was boredom bullseye. 
[04:00:30]  Man, oh man.  Yeah, so you went to Target, and what happened?  And I shoplifted a box of Teddy Grahams, hand sanitizer, and Vaseline, and got busted.  All right.  Okay.  Why those products?  Yes, I can understand the Teddy Grahams.  You were probably hungry.  I was.  The hand sanitizer is an iffy thing, but if you were, if you just wanted to clean your  hands, perhaps, that I can understand. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  Vaseline, there's only one reason to have a shoplifted Vaseline, and that is because you  wanted to go and masturbate.  No.  And use the worst lubricant possible for Vaseline.  No, no.  Did you want to eat the Teddy Grahams, and then jerk off to how tasty they were, and then  clean up?  Oh, clean up.  Yeah.  Why Vaseline?  No, I just needed some.  For what?  For what?  Well, because there's that region in between the penis. 
[04:01:30]  Holy shit.  And the leg, where I rub it on, so I don't, like, irritate any skin.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  You put Vaseline between, like, your nutsack and your thigh?  Yes.  For what?  Were you shaking, playing baseball?  Dude, that would fucking occupy my mind the entire day.  I'd walk around like I got fucked in the ass.  Yeah, squishy, squishy.  You'd have to be like, how do you not, how is that not the most uncomfortable feeling 
[04:02:00]  to walk around with?  It's like you shit your diaper or something.  No, it's fine.  No, it's not.  No, I used to, I don't know, it's just, it's kind of like my morning ritual.  You do it every, you have Vaseline right now between your skull sack and your thigh.  Yeah, after I take a shower, I got my cupboard, I just.  Cupboard?  Pick it up and I do the little.  Fucking Charles Ingalls.  Go to the cupboard, half pint.  Use the cupboard.  I think he's still.  Colon cancer.  I think he's. 
[04:02:30]  Coffee enema.  I think he still thinks he's going to make the major leagues.  Who?  You.  Me?  Seems like you're obsessed with baseball stuff.  That'll look a little odd, him dipping his hand down his pants and then spitballing  it with the Vaseline from his ball bag.  We got Jessica on the line.  Now, who is this Jessica girl again?  She's a, she's a coworker.  I've worked with her for like four years.  At Target?  No, no.  At, we, we work at a hospital together.  Oh boy.  Angel of death. 
[04:03:00]  Please tell me you're a male nurse.  I, I, I do do a nurse's aide.  Dude, stop.  Holy shit.  How many people have you put out of their misery?  Holy shit.  It's all starting to make sense.  How many people have you just put out of their misery?  They're suffering.  It's okay.  I just wipe ass and, you know, do the nurse's aide thing.  Oh my God.  He's a male.  You're a candy striper.  I'm not, and I, and I, and I do secretarial work, uh, on the side for, uh, another department  in the hospital.  And I also, uh, transport patients in another department. 
[04:03:30]  So I, I do basically a lot of different things.  And Jessica, I've, I've worked with for, uh, quite some time.  Please, to the best of your ability, describe Jessica.  Uh, well, she's, she's short, uh, kind of, kind of, uh, like about five, one, five, one,  uh, brown hair, green eyes.  Um, very, very good looking.  I, I would give her a 10.  Um, and you've been working with her for a long time and you've had a crush, a major  crush on her, but you're basically in love with her, right? 
[04:04:00]  For the last two years.  Yeah.  And yesterday you actually told her on the phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because she, well, here's the deal is that I, when I was in New York, we, we've been talking  on and off and I left a series of voicemail messages like on a week by week basis.  Just, Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Call me back.  You know, I, I hope you're doing well.  And she's, she never called back.  But then all of a sudden when I was on the air, uh, yesterday, she, uh, my phone rang 
[04:04:30]  instantly and it was her.  So you're saying that she might've been attracted to the fact that you were getting some air time.  I have no idea, but it was just kind of weird.  Do you think it's possible?  Did you ask her, I'm your density?  No, I didn't do a George McFly thing.  I'm your density.  Why did you call her a bitch cunt yesterday?  Yeah.  That doesn't seem like a.  Well, I, I got there, I don't get angry too much, but I, I was getting a little, I was  getting a little angry because she said I was being mean and, and I was like, and I 
[04:05:00]  said, what am I being mean about?  And she, and she didn't really know what to say.  And so I'm like, listen, way to counteract that by the way.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Way to diffuse the situation.  And I, she wouldn't explain how I was being mean.  And I, and I said, uh, you know what?  You're acting like a, you're acting like a bitch cunt.  But, but then I profusely apologized after that because I, I don't like to, uh, but it's  too late.  That multiple choice. 
[04:05:30]  Why don't we say hi to Jessica?  Jessica.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Do you know anything about us?  I don't, but I have a list of things that I'm supposed to say.  A list of things you're supposed to say.  No.  Yeah.  I'm supposed to say, Hey, Opie, what's up brother, man?  Mother Hucker.  Who?  And Ron and Fez knew until three.  What, what, Jesse, don't, what are you doing? 
[04:06:00]  Ryan gave me a list.  Who?  Ryan.  Who's that?  No, it's, it's one of, one of my buddies who's like a super fan and, and he, he probably  fed her some lines to say, but she's, she's, you know, I, you know, stop.  Just stop.  You consider yourself a 10?  No.  Adam does.  I heard that.  She will be next year.  How old a gal are you?  I'm 22.  22. 
[04:06:30]  Um, how much do you weigh?  About a hundred.  Cool.  A hundred.  Okay.  You're five, one, five, one, three fourths.  Yeah.  You can, you could probably lose three pounds.  So you're, you're a petite girl.  I am.  That's good.  So, uh, what do you know about this Adam guy?  I know a lot about him.  Yeah.  How about you elaborate on that a little bit?  She doesn't elaborate at all.  She's a one word. 
[04:07:00]  She just says one word and it, and it fucking pisses the shit out of me.  So, Adam, I think you were buying the Teddy Grahams to try out your Cheez-It thing.  What's his Cheez-It thing, Jess?  No.  Are you going to tell him, Adam?  No.  Do I, I, you know what, Jesse?  I don't give a shit.  I don't care what you say.  Wow.  He is really violent toward you.  I don't care.  He's got, um.  Tell him, Adam.  What's the Cheez-It thing?  Yeah, what is the Cheez-It thing? 
[04:07:30]  Does it involve your asshole?  No, I, I just like to, uh, you know, put, put Cheez-Its on my erection and use them  as a catapult and catch them in my mouth.  All right, listen, dude.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're so full of shit.  I know, of course you are.  Jessica.  Do you think we're idiots?  Yeah.  Jessica, has he told you this?  He told me this.  Oh, he's kidding.  He's trying to be shocking.  No.  Um, what do you know about him that you've experienced? 
[04:08:00]  That, well, I know he can do some stripper dances.  You've seen them?  I have.  So you guys work in the hospital together?  Are you guys in cahoots together?  Of course you have.  Are you trying to get air time?  No, no, no, I, she's, she's, she's just a terror.  She doesn't know how to emote.  She's a one word gal.  I, I, you know, try to get something out of her, but she doesn't really say what she, 
[04:08:30]  what she, uh, feels or, you know, she doesn't, she's, who came up with the Cheez-Its gag  where you said you, you, you, that's made up.  Of course it is.  That's made up.  No, it's not.  How do you know?  He told me.  Exactly.  When?  When he told me the remote story.  I mean, when was that?  The remote story where he measured his dick.  When is that?  Yeah, but when did he tell you this?  Yeah, but when did he tell you this? 
[04:09:00]  How long ago?  Like last year at work.  So now, do you like this girl?  I, I do, but, um, it's, it's complicated because I'm, I'm, I'm very awkward.  And, uh, she, she has a boyfriend who she's, uh, constantly on and off with.  And so I, I don't really know, I don't really know how to, how to make my, make my move.  I don't, I don't have any moves, really.  You know who he reminds me of?  Adam Sandler. 
[04:09:30]  A little bit.  You actually do.  I'm telling him.  So Jess, wait, Chester's Liver's saying that that's a Dane Cook bit, but he uses a different  food product instead of Cheez-Its.  What does he use?  Like fucking peanuts or something?  I don't remember.  I just, I just remember that was a Dane Cook.  Oh, yeah.  It's cashews.  Cashews.  Yes.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Come on, dude.  That's a Dane Cook bit.  Yeah, but I, I juxtaposed it with Cheez-Its one day.  He is weird.  But, but I, I'm starting to think it's, it's a big put on. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  No, no.  Jess, what's he like at work?  You went over the top with the Cheez-Its thing.  Yeah.  What's he like at work, for real?  What's Adam like at work?  Yes.  He is awkward, like he said.  Okay.  He's funny.  Okay.  He's really funny.  But toward the end, he got cocky.  How cocky?  How?  Rude and cocky.  Um, did you know that he- 
[04:10:30]  And that is why I didn't call him back.  Did you know that he liked you?  Um, I did.  Because one night he got really drunk and told me.  How'd he say it?  He just came right out with it.  And said that, uh, what, he loves you?  Yeah, he's had a crush on me for two years.  Uh, yes.  Sam.  Did you just say he got really drunk and told her?  Yeah. 
[04:11:00]  Adam has proclaimed, uh, off the air that he has never tried alcohol.  Well, no, I, you know.  Is your web of lies crumbling here?  Yeah, Sam.  No.  Yeah, it's all coming apart.  It's crumbling.  I think we got him on the ropes here.  No.  We got, we got, like, uh...  No, if there, if there's a party, you know, and people are offering, and people are drinking...  You said you had never, ever tried alcohol.  We got another eye patch situation here.  Yeah.  Linger longer.  So, now, explain this.  How did you say you've never had a drink? 
[04:11:30]  Well, I just said, I said I don't drink.  And, uh...  No, no, no.  From what Sam's saying, he's saying you elaborated to the point where you really made a point of saying that you don't, you've never drank.  I, I don't like to, because, uh...  That's not what you said.  Mars is a witness.  Mars is in here.  And he said to both of us...  Mars?  No, no, no.  Adam said...  No, I know.  I'm just getting Mars...  Yeah, Adam, you said you don't drink at all.  No.  Yesterday.  Yes, you did.  And you said you never have.  No, I, I don't. 
[04:12:00]  Uh, there was a period where I just, I just gave it up, and I just don't do it anymore, because it, it brings out stupid things.  It's not what he said yesterday.  What did he say, Mars?  He said he doesn't drink, and he has never tried it.  Oh, he did say he's never tried it.  I didn't say that.  Something to that effect, right?  Oh, we got another, uh, witness.  Tony?  I, uh, asked him if he wanted a spitter.  Just joking around.  What's a spitter?  Uh, skull.  And he told me he's never done nicotine or alcohol in his life before.  That was the second day he was here. 
[04:12:30]  Now, you, so why would you say that?  Well, I, I didn't, I don't do tobacco.  I don't smoke.  But I, I, I drink occasionally.  Um...  Wait, Tony, don't go anywhere.  And it, and it brings out the, it brings out the worst in me.  Um, and I, and I don't do it.  I, I do it very rarely.  And, um...  Tony.  Tony's very opinionated and the true, uh, star of the, of the, uh, Than and Sam show.  Tony.  No offense, guys.  What, what do you think about this kid?  Well, we went out for interviews on the street, uh, Tuesday, I believe. 
[04:13:00]  And he seemed pretty normal to me.  I mean, there was no kind of shenanigans going on.  He was just, you know, getting people.  And it was like any other intern.  And then when he comes in here, it's crazy.  It's all like, uh, well, I, uh, I, I, no, I was just trying to help you guys out and  get, get people.  No, you did a good job.  This is a wacky character.  I was, I was...  He's a wacky character guy.  Is this a wacky character?  That he won't break.  Uh, yeah, I, I think as soon as you guys come in here, it kind of flips. 
[04:13:30]  He was fine this morning, you know.  And then you guys come in here and he was, he's screaming baseball players' names with big  heads while the door's open.  I think you're wacky.  Jess, is his diction different now than you know him at work?  Is he a little more stilted now?  Um, he seems a little shyer.  Are you part of the bit, Jess?  You could tell us.  Are you part of the bit? 
[04:14:00]  No.  How did he prep you?  Just tell us that.  Yeah.  See if it's consistent.  Because he, we were told that he prepped you.  I want to see if it's the same way.  Oh, no.  Um, I talked to him yesterday and he told me I could say whatever I wanted.  Okay.  He called you a bitch cunt?  A stupid bitch cunt.  And when he was trying to, like, tell you how he's perceived on the show, what did he say?  He didn't really say too much about that. 
[04:14:30]  He just said he was the internant.  He didn't say that he's kind of weird and...  No, she already knows, she already knows I'm fucked up.  Don't try to, don't try to interfere with my fucking ruse, my clever ruse.  Yeah.  My questioning, my line of questioning.  I think it's a bit.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, what's, what's the bit there?  What is the bit?  What's the end game with this one?  There's no, there's no bit, uh, there, there's no bit at all.  I, you know, I, I just, uh, you know, I, I had all my, all my ducks in a row. 
[04:15:00]  I, I, you know, I, I would like to say that, that Jesse has been like probably the only girl  that I've like, uh, ever associated with on a normal basis.  The only girl who's gotten me.  Um, and I didn't really know where to take that.  And, uh, you know, I, I, I had like a couple opportunities here and there.  I, I, I missed them immensely. 
[04:15:30]  Oh my God.  Listen, I, I bored with this guy.  First of all, the remote story is also BS.  That's like from Rescue Me, Dennis Leary.  Thanks for reminding me of that one.  Dennis Leary talks about that in Rescue Me.  The other thing that it's so obvious you're lying at him because you won't look at anybody.  I mean, who do you think you're dealing with?  Yeah, yeah, you just, I'm not, you think we're fucking rookies?  No, I, I know body language.  I've, I've been studying body language since I was 18 years old.  You're looking down at the console because you know, if you look in someone's eyes, you're  going to be had.  No, I.  So tell us what's going on. 
[04:16:00]  There's no, there's nothing.  Do you want airtime?  If you want airtime, we can figure something out.  There's no, there's no airtime.  It's just, uh.  No, there is airtime.  There is.  But, uh.  I, I just.  There's no airtime.  There is.  I, I think what's happened is there's a bit of truth that's just been, let's say, exaggerated.  Right.  I think this is a magnification and that's where the character part of it comes in.  I don't think that he's completely unawkward, um, or shy.  I think that's probably a part of who he is.  But I think it's exaggerated here to be interesting.  No, I think this is some kind of fucking groundlings performance. 
[04:16:30]  I'm saying here.  This is like, he's, he's doing a performance piece.  No, I, no, I don't.  See, look Anthony in the eye and tell him it's not true.  No, it's not true.  He's a liar.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jess, are you in on this?  No, I don't think he's lying.  You've worked together and he's been like this, exactly like this.  He's never normal.  He's always a fucking weirdo. 
[04:17:00]  Come on, Jess.  He's sometimes normal.  He can have a conversation if he needs to.  What is she saying?  What?  I can't hear.  But he's awkward at times.  You can't hear what she's saying?  Yeah, because we have that, that microphone is blocked, so you can't hear what she's saying.  Coach her.  Oh, man.  Hmm.  What the fuck is going on?  I don't know.  He won't fess up.  Why'd Tony leave? 
[04:17:30]  Yeah, I love Tony.  Why'd Tony turn into fucking Samuel the Shy Sea Lion?  I don't know.  Mars?  No, it's okay, Mars.  He doesn't need to hear it.  No, I know.  You sure?  I was right.  We blocked it on purpose.  We'll tell him what she's saying.  It's just something doesn't smell right here.  And we know that. 
[04:18:00]  Something is not right.  Yeah.  What's going on?  I don't know what's going on.  I just, uh, what was she saying?  How do you feel about him, Jess?  He's a nice kid.  I like him as a friend.  Are you attracted to him?  I don't know.  I never thought about it.  Sometimes, when he's not cocky and mean.  And mean?  Cocky and mean? 
[04:18:30]  Cocky and mean and calling me nasty names.  What are you talking about?  He sounds like he's acting.  No, no, I, no, you know, I was just cocky and mean because I would, you know, my, my life's, uh, for, for the past fucking three years, my life has been shit.  And, uh, the past year, you know, things have been working out for me and I was joking around, laughing, having a good time.  And, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, I don't know how you feel about that, but it's, it's, you know, I, I come in, uh, when I, you know, I'm just happy, you know? 
[04:19:00]  And, and I'm, I'm just trying to be a different guy because, uh, you know, things are, things are working out and, and I don't know if you, you don't like what, sweetheart?  I don't like the different guy, the new guy.  You don't like the new guy?  He's cocky.  The new guy.  Well, you know what?  Uh, I, I don't know, I don't know what your deal is.  Um, you're, you're going, you're going to Colorado. 
[04:19:30]  Um, I'm probably never going to fucking talk to you again, you know?  All right, wait, I know the lie.  Don't you guys work together still?  No, she's, she's taking a month off to go to Colorado.  Um, Jess, are you working today?  Actually, I have a day off today.  Ah.  And when are you working again?  Tomorrow.  And Adam, when are you working again?  Uh, sometime in, like, uh, early March.  What?  I'm, I'm taking, I'm taking a week off.  I got to tie up some loose ends, uh, in Michigan. 
[04:20:00]  And so I'm going to pick up a couple of days.  What's that to put lie on the whole?  A week off.  It's February 7th.  Yeah, what?  In early March, in early March.  So when?  So you're going to see her again.  This doesn't make any sense.  No, I'm not going to go see her.  She's suck at trying to get something going.  No, no.  She's, she's going to, uh, she, she's going to take a leave of absence to Colorado.  You said you're never going to see her again?  No, because she's probably going to move there.  And you know what?  But she's working tomorrow. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah.  And you're not taking off until fucking March.  It's February 7th.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way.  Yeah.  Thank you, Danny.  Let's play this clip real fast.  I get this erection.  I look over.  There's a can of cashews on my left.  You're right.  I open it up.  I take a cashew, put it on the tip of my hog.  I bent it back, shot it into my mouth.  First try.  See, that would be your cheesy bit.  Yeah.  Your life is based on, like, bits from other comedians. 
[04:21:00]  You know, I, I try, you know, you had me there, but, uh, you know, I, I just, I'd like  to close this chapter on my life because I, you know, I close it as mud bones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, you know, I, I, I don't know.  Uh, I don't know, Jessica.  Um, you know, you, you, she's, she's really just not a, I, I just don't like her as a  person.  Um, she, she treats people like shit.  She's treated me like shit for two years.  She's walked all over me. 
[04:21:30]  And it keeps going back to this, even though we're, we're not even addressing the you and  Jessica thing.  No, there, there, there is no, there is no thing.  No, we're addressing the fact that we think you're bullshitting with your whole act here.  No, I, no, I, you know, I, I'm just, uh,  I'm, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm trying to get, to get into trying, trying to do new things  and I'm, I'm trying to, trying to put myself out there and do a lot of different things  that I've never done.  Just be you. 
[04:22:00]  Go ahead.  No, no.  Break, break, break this character and go ahead.  Just be, be the guy you always are.  Be the guy you are when you, you're not on the show.  Go ahead.  How does, how does, I don't even know how.  It's, it's not this character that you're doing.  I, no.  You're doing like a character.  No.  Come on.  We know you're doing a character.  This is a character.  You're faking right now.  I'm not.  This whole, I, it's, it's, it's fake.  You can talk normal.  You can act normal.  You're not a weird guy.  You just do this so you can get air time and, and do like a bit and, and pull one over on 
[04:22:30]  everybody and it's, it's, it worked.  You had us for a little while, but now just be you.  Go ahead.  Snap right out of it.  Go ahead.  Well, I don't, I don't really know how to be me.  Talk about sports.  Something you, you know, real well, like, like baseball, you know, baseball real well.  You're not attentive and hesitant when you're talking about baseball.  Yeah.  Well, I, I like baseball.  I like old time baseball from like the 19, the 1900s.  And I, I like to, I, I like to read about it and everything. 
[04:23:00]  All right, listen.  It's, it's.  I'm bored with you.  Listen to me.  Listen, can we get a lie detector test in here?  Oh, we really should.  It's a, it's kind of a hack bit.  It's been done a lot, but can we get a lie detector test?  Jess, what do we get that done?  What?  What's he lying about?  Do you have a MySpace?  I got a MySpace.  Not you.  You got what?  I have a Facebook.  Facebook.  Can we punch it up?  Yeah, fine.  All right. 
[04:23:30]  Okay.  Give, uh, give Danny the, uh, go over there.  Okay.  Give Danny the Addy.  And, um, so everybody doesn't jump on it and freeze it up.  Because I want to see what's on there.  Maybe there's a clue.  He creeps me out.  It's, it's creepy on one hand, but on the second, I, I think it's such an act that he's, he's  an actor.  I think he's an actor comedian and he's doing this character that is based on things that 
[04:24:00]  he saw like the Dane and, and rescue me and stuff.  And, uh, he's probably a regular guy.  A regular guy.  He's nuts.  No, I don't think he is.  Yeah.  He's fucking nuts.  You don't think this is a bit?  I think he's fucking nuts.  I think it's a bit.  Multiple personalities.  No.  Okay.  Is that it?  What do we got?  It's the computer's frozen.  Ah, son of a bitch.  Frozen computer shit. 
[04:24:30]  Why don't we, uh, should we take a break?  Just take a break.  See if we can find that thing.  And then, uh, yeah, I, I just, I don't think he's crazy.  I think it's a bit.  All right.  Um, okay.  Tony gave me something, Adam.  Yes.  I want you to write down.  Yes.  Where you were when you told Jess you loved her.  Where I was when I told Jess that I loved her.  Yeah. 
[04:25:00]  Write it down right now.  Here's a Sharpie and paper.  He's writing.  Wah-dee-dee.  Jeez.  It's a location, for fuck's sake.  It should take two seconds.  He just crossed out his first answer.  Why, Sam?  No, because I, uh, I...  Because he was writing where he was when he called her yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  All right.  You're supposed to write down where you were when you told Jess you loved her. 
[04:25:30]  And also where Jess was, part two of the question.  Shouldn't take this long, should it?  Okay.  I'm, I'm, uh, I'm just about complete.  You're, uh, who shall I give this to?  Give it to Anthony.  Okay.  I really don't want any contact with you.  Ahem.  I smell psychopaths.  Psychopaths?  Yeah, you got multiple personalities. 
[04:26:00]  Ah.  You fucking scare me.  He says, a party in the summer.  And then, uh, where she was there as well.  Jess, is that true?  That's true.  We're sitting on the couch.  We were supposed to have Jess answer first.  Because if she's in on the bit, we just play into his hands.  Well, who, no one told me what the fuck was going on.  He gave me the paper and I read it.  See, because I don't trust her either. 
[04:26:30]  I didn't know what the bit was.  The whole bit was to have her answer and then we read Adam's answer.  That would have been good.  We just fucked it up.  Oh, well.  Oh, that could have been it right there.  Because I don't, because she sounds suspicious too.  I had no idea what the fuck that was.  It would have been, you know, nice if someone told me.  I had no clue.  Can you redo it?  Tony?  I don't know.  I think maybe we do whose party.  Where was it at?  I don't know.  I thought that was the way to go. 
[04:27:00]  Oh, we fucked it up.  Tony had a good idea too.  All right.  How about where was the party?  That's a good thing.  Hold on.  Don't say anything.  How about he writes down his answer and then she says it?  Yeah, yeah.  Am I late to another?  Just right on the back of my, no, no, those are my tour dates.  Right there.  Right where this party was.  There we go.  Yeah, you're right, Mikey, from Philly.  He repeated the question.  That's a mental stall tactic to come up with a lie.  Very good, Mikey.  Very good.  All right.  I have the location of the party, which I will not reveal. 
[04:27:30]  By the way, Anthony, is that what you just did?  I was pissing.  That's hilarious.  Anthony Nakumia writes, ha ha, way to go, Columbo.  No one told me what we were doing.  It's like, let Anthony read it because I don't want any contact with him, so I read it.  Oh, good.  Yeah, good point.  I led you down that road a little bit.  I didn't know where we were going there.  All right.  Jess, what party? 
[04:28:00]  A co-worker, Matt.  It says Matt's house.  It says Matt's house.  It's probably the hangout at his house all the time, a party.  That's why the party was revealed.  Well, after the party was revealed, she could easily remember a party that she possibly was at with this fucking clown.  All right.  We're going to get a lie detector.  I guess Danny's saying it'll take a couple of days, but we could certainly get one.  Yeah.  All right.  Why are you worried about a lie detector?  No, I'm not worried about a lie detector.  It's just that my personal life has been just destroyed. 
[04:28:30]  How?  What part?  What?  You know, you guys say I'm gay.  I'm asexual.  I don't know.  Why didn't you say you were gay?  We're asking.  I'm not gay.  That was an opinion, which is very different.  I just tried to.  I just tried to.  I don't really know.  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah.  I'll make it perfectly clear.  I don't know if you're gay. 
[04:29:00]  I don't know if you're asexual.  I don't know what the fuck you are.  The bottom line is you were saying you've never kissed a girl at age 22.  No.  So being gay was an option.  Of course, guys are going to think that or ask it.  Oh, I'm an asexual.  You said, all right, well, asexual, maybe you don't like the fuck at all.  You said no.  I don't know.  I just.  I got a question.  Why are we letting the interns wreck a wonderful radio show?  I don't know.  Between Hip Hop Ron and this clown.  Hip Hop Ron.  I'm sorry.  He stunk on ice.  Yeah.  Oh, did he?  All right, we're going to get a lie detector test for you. 
[04:29:30]  All right.  What do you want to admit right now, man?  I mean, stop.  What do I want to admit?  Something is up here.  Are you on drugs?  No.  Prescription pills?  Are you seeing like a psychiatrist or a psychologist?  I'm on a prescription.  I'm on Zoloft.  I take Zoloft.  Maybe that would be the mood thing.  The other day he said no.  I'm on Zoloft.  I've been, you know, kind of my first couple years in college.  All right.  Things kind of hit the fan.  You know, we asked you the other day if you were on any kind of medication. 
[04:30:00]  You said no.  You said aspirin sometimes or something.  Yeah.  That's another lie.  Now it's Zoloft?  And I'm reading your face.  When you squish your face like that, that's usually another sign that you're lying about.  You know, I...  When you do that, that, this thing.  Well, I always...  You squish your eyebrows together.  Are you a compulsive liar?  I'm not a compulsive liar.  I try to be very truthful with...  Well, you lied about the Zoloft.  Why did you lie about the medication?  And the drinking.  Well, because I was, I was very, I was very nervous yesterday. 
[04:30:30]  Because you guys, you guys were grilling me quite hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, I...  So you just happen to have Zoloft laying around when you're nervous.  And because we grilled you, you decide to pop a Zoloft.  Oh, I...  You know, I just, I went to a counselor for a couple years.  And he helped get things straightened out.  And everything's good.  When was the last time you've been to a counselor or a doctor of psychiatry or psychology? 
[04:31:00]  December.  This past December.  Yes.  And is that when you were prescribed the Zoloft?  No, I, I, I was prescribed the Zoloft, uh, two years, uh, prior.  But you said you don't do drugs, or...  No, no, not, not drugs.  We have audio of you saying that.  Not drugs.  We also have audio.  We gotta find it where you admit you, you've never drank before.  No, but drugs like, not like hard drugs or marijuana.  No, we asked you if you were on prescription drugs, like Zoloft or something like that. 
[04:31:30]  Well...  You said no.  The thing, the thing is yesterday, you guys took the wind out of my sails, um, pretty bad.  You got Zoloft on you right now?  Uh, it's at my, it's in my, uh, nightstand.  As he dropped something nervously.  What'd you drop?  Uh, a pen.  You can grab it if you need it.  Uh, Steve, why, just say it.  Um, it's, it has nothing to do with that.  Do you actually interview these guys?  Oh yeah, totally.  This never, this never surfaced.  Believe me, this is all shocking. 
[04:32:00]  That is shocking.  Someone is suggesting that you dress up like your mom and sit in a rocking chair.  What are you writing down?  Uh, remember a gunshot guy from Philly?  Yeah.  He's right there.  So?  That's what I was, that's what I was going to write down.  Exactly.  That's what you raced in with?  Jesus.  Race?  Hardly raced in.  He came in.  How much more can we talk about?  The Dodgers have moved to Los Angeles.  How much more can we talk about his gunshot?  Did he get shot again?  I'll go find out.  Please do.  All right, thanks.  Come back.  Fucking place is falling apart. 
[04:32:30]  That's how you throw a monkey wrench into a show.  Hey, I'll have you know he asked.  And why are you saying take the wind out of my sails?  That's like lying shit.  No, I, I, you guys, you guys were grilling me pretty hard yesterday and I, I didn't know  how to react to it.  Um, and yeah.  Why were you stealing from Target?  Well, because I, I don't know.  I, I just felt like doing it.  Um, I wasn't really thinking.  Are we safe with this guy around here? 
[04:33:00]  I'm out of this pit.  This guy is going to fucking do something stupid.  No, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm quite normal.  You're a klepto.  I just don't know how to fit in with the, with this crew currently.  Um, I'll say.  We were, when, during the walkover, by the way.  Uh, you know I said hi to you as I was entering the building, right?  No.  And you just, were just staring off into the distance?  I walked right by you.  I figured, all right, the guy had a, had a tough the last couple of days.  I'll just acknowledge that he exists. 
[04:33:30]  I say hi and he's just sitting there like this.  Be kind of cordial.  No, I, I nodded my head.  No, you didn't.  Are you dead?  What, what Danny?  Well, I, when I was coming into the building, Adam was just kind of hanging, uh, right by  the, uh, the entryway.  So I just pulled the old, uh, you know, working hard or hardly working.  And, uh, he didn't know how to react to that, so he decided the best way would be to shove  me.  And we all just kind of stood around and said, what, what was that?  Like, why did you do that?  He shoved you?  Yeah, we were all just kind of shocked.  Like, how, like, we didn't understand why that, that happened the way it did.  And he still doesn't have a proper response for that. 
[04:34:00]  And then he laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world.  Um, you have a little violence streak in you, don't you?  No.  Is that why you're on Zoloft?  Well, Zoloft is, is, you know, to calm you down like that.  Uh, have you had, like, violence, uh, in your past, or there's never been any violence?  No, I, I, I got, I got angry one time and, uh, I, uh, I, I slapped my steering wheel  like 12 times and, and broke my hand.  Um, and then there was another time where I just took my glasses and I threw them against 
[04:34:30]  the wall.  Sam's back.  Well, that's about it.  You, um, you ever, uh, have any problems with, um, any kind of violence against people?  Assault?  No, no.  Battery?  Nothing like that?  Nothing like that.  Not even just an arrest without any, um, charges being done?  Kenny can look it up.  Oh, yeah.  And, and by the way, when do you work next?  Tomorrow.  Monday.  All right, you're bringing in your Zoloft, you know that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  And Sam, what do you got?  Did you ever shop with before, any other time than at Target? 
[04:35:00]  Yes.  Where?  Or, like, all over.  Oh.  Like, what else have you stolen?  Um, like, DVDs and, uh, like, when The Sopranos, the final season came out, I would,  I would take those from various stores and then just sell them on eBay and get, like,  get, like, 60 bucks.  So, now, what makes me think our shit is safe around here?  No, no.  If he steals it, it goes on eBay.  No, no.  It's, it's, it's, it's not like that.  I, I've been, I've been, uh, to, uh, to probation. 
[04:35:30]  I've, I've talked.  I've talked to a woman and.  That helps.  A woman.  So have I.  Yeah.  It didn't help my anger or.  Yeah.  You know, it's all, it's all getting straightened out.  Um, I, I, I admit to my guilt and it's, it's all being straightened out.  I'm missing the point.  I'm not talking about the legal shit.  I'm talking about.  The legal shit.  The idea of that you do that a lot.  You obviously have done it a lot.  You've stolen a lot of different shit.  So why would we feel comfortable with our stuff around you?  Oh, my God.  No.  And the lies keep coming in. 
[04:36:00]  Jimmy, good point.  Hold that thought for a second because I don't want this to go flying by without reading it.  He said yesterday, where the fuck is it?  God damn it.  You're really, this kid pisses me off.  He said yesterday, uh, that he only saw a high school counselor.  A high school counselor?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got audio of it.  What?  You said that, uh.  Our listeners, they listen to every fucking word of the show.  We asked if you had been to a psychiatrist or been to therapy and you said, no, you saw a high school counselor.  I said, I said a counselor.  I said, I just said a counselor. 
[04:36:30]  Where's the audio from yesterday?  Yeah, now we need the audio from yesterday.  It was a counselor and it was relating to an event that happened when I was in high school.  Right, the death of your coach at a very young age from a car accident.  Yes.  And I didn't say a high school counselor.  I said, I went to just a normal counselor and to talk about that incident.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So I'm not.  Well.  You're not.  Um, you're going to be part of the blockbuster trade. 
[04:37:00]  That's right.  You for Lily.  You and Hip Hop Ron.  For Lily.  And Ron Benkin.  And Dave's balls.  I have a, uh, I have a text here.  Someone who will go nameless.  It says, give me his pedigree info.  I'll run his lying ass.  Okay.  K to C.  So we'll need, uh.  No, no, no.  Oh, no.  Cool.  Someone else.  Good.  That's very good. 
[04:37:30]  Yeah, we'll get, we'll get your info.  So we'll have him run you.  How old was your, uh.  See what you got.  How old was your baseball coach when he died?  Um, either 25 or 26.  Well, yesterday you said 26.  I, I, even I know that.  And I could give a shit about your stupid baseball coach that died in a car accident.  Yeah.  But it was very obvious you said 26.  20, you know, I.  But it affected you so deeply that you had to go to counseling.  Right.  Yeah.  Compulsive liar.  That's what's coming in.  No.  You really are kind of getting tripped up on a lot of this. 
[04:38:00]  I'm, I'm not.  I'm, I'm just.  No, you are.  You, you, you're, you're tripping up on some, uh, questions.  Just a few.  All right.  Where'd you steal a target again?  Well, uh, Teddy Grahams, um, hand sanitizer, um, some Vaseline.  So what else would be stolen besides that and the Sopranos DVDs? 
[04:38:30]  Uh, you know, just, uh, papers, gum, uh.  Come on, man.  I'm trying to think about what else.  Um, some DVDs of previous, of series of like HBO stuff from Best Buy.  Why so vague?  What?  Why so vague?  You should be able to just go, I, I, I stole this DVD, that DVD.  Well, because, uh, you know, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, um, Sopranos. 
[04:39:00]  You know, I.  And you've, uh, how much money have you made, uh, selling those?  You know, uh, about 500.  500 on eBay?  Yeah.  All right.  Look up his eBay name.  Give him, give, give, give him your name on eBay.  We found, uh, uh, audio from yesterday, Butcher?  Yesterday.  And we'll see if he's sold anything.  Yeah, this is Adam from yesterday.  Are you on drugs?  Was I?  Prescription, right now?  I don't, um, I don't take any drugs.  Don't drink, don't smoke. 
[04:39:30]  Therapy?  Huh?  Don't drink, don't smoke.  You didn't therapy?  Uh, no, I, I did a little bit of counseling, uh, back in the day.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not December, back in the day.  What was this day?  Uh, like, a couple years ago.  Oh.  A couple years ago.  And it was for what?  Uh, for, for depression.  Dude, you were a little depressed.  Well, you know, things were, things were happening, and, uh, you know.  Things were happening.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  What was happening?  Like, happening.  Well, you know, some, uh, some things in my life.  I, I, you know, uh, a couple people died, and, you know, I had to just, uh. 
[04:40:00]  You killed them?  No.  Cheasing, of course.  No.  Family members?  Who died?  Older?  One of, uh, one of my coaches, uh, from, uh, baseball.  Hilarious.  Who else died besides your coach?  That was, uh, that was yesterday, where he said, no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.  Yeah.  Counselor a few years back.  Well, he did, I am looking up here, he does indeed have some Sopranos stuff for sale.  Um. 
[04:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, everything, everything that he's sold is, uh, all DVD box sets.  DVD box sets.  Yeah.  It's, it's, I, I don't really like to talk about this, because it, it happened, like,  six months ago, when I, when I finally got caught, and I, I, I really just feel uncomfortable  talking about it.  Um, it, it happened six months ago, it said, you're a weird dude, what the fuck is up with  you?  All these fucking sales end, uh, January 20th, 08.  That's not six months ago, that's two weeks ago. 
[04:41:00]  Oh, cause I, I just.  Three weeks ago.  I just got around to selling them.  What the fuck is up with you, bro?  He's still selling the stolen goods.  So you got caught, you went through all your thing, you saw, you talked to the woman,  but you still sold the stolen stuff.  Why not?  All right, so the problem is not solving.  That's my point.  No, no.  You are the same guy.  That's why I said, why would our shit be safe around you?  And you said, because I talked to a woman, but you're three weeks ago, you're selling  stolen merchandise on eBay.  Yeah.  How much are you selling those, uh, maraschino cherries for, I see up there? 
[04:41:30]  What?  Three jars.  Wow.  No, I didn't take any of those.  Of course not.  No.  What's your record like on, uh, on eBay?  You got a good, uh, record as a 13, a hundred percent feedback on stolen merch.  That's great.  Yeah.  All right.  So I'm not, I'm not, I'm not proud of it.  I'm not proud.  I'd be.  That's pretty cool.  Actually got away with it. 
[04:42:00]  Who else died beside your coach?  Well, my, uh, my grandpa did, uh, he did, he did.  He wasn't like terminally ill.  So he just kind of just, uh, instantly just kind of hit the deck, uh, randomly.  Um, what was the name of your, uh, baseball coach?  Uh, Dave, uh, Susala.  Throw that into Google.  How do you spell his last name?  Um, S-U-S-A-L-L-A.  All right.  Gold star on eBay, huh? 
[04:42:30]  Not bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think, uh, I think Adam, uh, doesn't know who he really is.  You said Dave, right?  What was that first name?  Uh, Dave or David, however you want to put it.  I bet you that comes up accurate.  Sure.  I think he, I think he's just.  Compulsive liar, probably.  No.  I have.  Klepto.  Klepto.  I'm not, I'm not a klepto.  He got his shoes.  He doesn't know who he is, so he steals his shit from comedians.  Yeah.  To make himself more interesting. 
[04:43:00]  I think you're afraid you're not going to be interesting.  Like, why else would you take a Dane bit and make it part of your life?  Like, you don't do that.  Well, I have, I have tried it after I heard it, but, you know, I, I, I did, yes, I, I  did, um, steal that bit, and I, I apologize for that, Jimmy.  No, don't apologize.  You're not a comic.  I'm not saying it's wrong.  You told a chick a lie to make yourself interesting.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've all done that.  Panning out?  Danny?  Yeah.  The Dave, uh, Susala thing looks to be legit. 
[04:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, so I'm starting to get a feel for this kid.  I think, uh, he's got some major issues, major, not little issues.  He doesn't know who he is.  He's, he's, uh, he's a weirdo.  A weirdo.  He's a weirdo.  You're diagnosing him as weirdo?  Yeah, he's a weirdo.  Hmm.  He's creeping me the fuck out.  Then he has these moments of normalcy that, uh.  I was just trying to get people on the street to, to talk, uh, to Tony on the, on the mic.  I was trying to just, like, block all my weirdness and all the shit going on, trying to get people to, to get good audio. 
[04:44:00]  You don't own any guns?  I don't own any guns.  No?  No.  I, I was just, I was just trying to do my duties.  I try to block this stuff out.  I try to get the job done.  You know, and, and I, I do have issues.  Um.  What are your issues?  Because now you're starting to admit some shit.  You know, just.  So, yeah.  Well, my, minor, minor, uh, kleptasy.  Klept, I don't know how to say it.  Kleptomaniac. 
[04:44:30]  Kleptomaniac.  And you lie when it's convenient.  You like to paint a picture of yourself that's not necessarily accurate.  Just spit it out, dude.  I'm an alcoholic.  I'm an addict.  I'm a sex addict.  And we all have character defects.  No, not all of us.  I'm pretty much close to perfect at this point.  No, okay, we have a grandiose sociopath.  Everybody can't do things wrong with them.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Grandiose sociopath.  Not even a boss.  You didn't even think about it like, well.  Anyway.  And by the way, you said you weren't a klepto 10 minutes ago. 
[04:45:00]  Now you're finally admitting that.  I mean, I had some, I had some issues.  There was a period of time when I was just taking things.  Um.  You know, I do have some depression issues that I'm getting over.  And, you know, I'm dealing with those right now.  And I'm just trying to think positive about, about everything.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Should we take a break?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Let's let this all simmer and marinate for a little while. 
[04:45:30]  Danny, we could get a lie detector guy?  That's what I'm hearing.  It'll take a few days just to get the money approved, but we could, uh.  Really?  We could do it.  How much is it, Dan?  I don't know.  Steve's working on it.  All right.  We're going to try to set that up.  We're going to do a moment of truth with you.  Yeah.  See, now that you brought it to everyone's attention, now we're going to end this thing  somehow.  Yeah.  Or this just ends up being just a boring hour of radio.  So now we've got to fucking hook you up to a lie detector test to, uh, to fucking save  this shit. 
[04:46:00]  No.  You know, I, uh, it's not a bit.  I, I, you know, I am who I am, you know?  I can't, I really can't help it.  Puddle of, uh, puddle of AIDS.  Please let Kenny waterboard this lying prick.  Ah, Kenny.  I'm worried about your guy's safety.  No, I don't know about safety.  No.  I, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny and I do not, do not, Kenny does not like me.  No, because he's, uh.  He probably sees that there's something off about you.  Yeah, Kenny's.  And you're not being genuine.  Kenny's a perceptive, he was an interrogator, that's what he did. 
[04:46:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he, he doesn't, he doesn't really like me.  Well, maybe we should get Kenny on the phone and find out why.  Is he still around or did he, he left, right?  Could interrogate you.  All right.  That'd be a tough interrogation.  All right, we'll do a lie detector test.  Thanks, Adam.  You're welcome.  There he goes.  Out the studio, very slowly, very methodically, messing with his glass.  Where's Poe?  As he steps out.  Poe's right there, behind you. 
[04:47:00]  All right.  He's a weirdo.  Poe?  Well, yeah.  You, Rocky, got anything on Adam?  Um, we're trying to get in touch with, I think it's his aunt over at Channel 11.  What?  Yeah.  He apparently has some kind of family member that works over at Channel 11 for the morning show.  Oh.  So, uh, Steve's trying to track down exactly who it is.  Because apparently this is the person that got him on, uh, Jill's dance Friday.  Jill Nicolini?  And I guess put in a good word for him for his internship, so. 
[04:47:30]  Well.  I'm trying to track this person down.  All right.  Jill Nicolini is good if you're, if, if you're thinking about buying a bra.  Go to her for some advice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean.  All right.  Now that we're all fucking tired, we're going to regroup again because of another intern.  How you doing?  This is Club Soda Kenny.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Which ain't that bad.  Opie and Anthony. 
[04:48:00]  It was awful.  Worthless.  They're the worst.  Just screaming every racial epithet you can think of.  An abomination.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I had a gun question for you, too, when we get a chance to throw that in there.  Yeah, throw it in.  Love it.  It's a, it's, it's a pop culture gun question.  Ooh.  Your favorite movie gun of all time.  Literally.  In a movie, your favorite movie gun.  Wow.  That's a good one. 
[04:48:30]  And not general, but like the gun from this.  Yeah.  Is my favorite movie gun.  Yeah.  I, off the top of my head, without really thinking about it much, uh, that frigging  helicopter machine gun from fucking Predator.  Oh, the, uh, okay.  All right.  Yeah.  That is, that's a classic.  That was pretty good.  I mean, that ripped shit apart.  That was pretty good.  That's a, that's a, I would argue with that.  Yeah.  I was just curious.  Good movie gun.  Because you're a gun guy.  Yeah.  That's a good movie. 
[04:49:00]  Mine is, uh, Desert Eagle.  Desert Eagle's always good.  Desert Eagle.  Oh.  There's a great clip on, uh, YouTube of a little skinny girl shooting at Desert Eagle  and it, the kick puts, puts the thing square across the bridge of a nose and a forehead.  Bam!  Oh, wow.  Did it knock her out?  You can't, no, she stood up, but they, they kind of really quick.  I guess the people with the camera were a little concerned, but, uh, man, you get hit  in the face with that motherfucker.  They're heavy guns too.  That is, there's no fucking reason to have that gun. 
[04:49:30]  Aside from the fact that you want it, um, I will be getting one.  Really?  Yeah.  Once I, uh, yeah.  I have to, uh, do a few things.  What?  Some paperwork's got to get in order.  You can have one, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, there's, that's pretty much a, I got a small dick.  Uh, there's the girl against Bob. 
[04:50:00]  Yeah, here she is.  It's on break.  Look at this.  What's, what's, what's the search on break for the people out there?  Uh, probably Desert Eagle and.  Okay.  She's ready to shoot it.  Yeah.  She's really thin.  Oh my God.  Right in the middle of the forehead.  Yeah.  It just cracks her.  Oh!  Wait, the front of the gun pops backwards.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  She's lucky another shot didn't come out.  Yeah, she could have died, right?  She could have shot herself in the head. 
[04:50:30]  Hey, uh, it's coming out.  Oh, is that fantastic?  The Rose McGowan gun in Planet Terra.  The leg.  Yeah, you like that one?  The leg.  That was a little weird.  Nah, that one, I wouldn't say that.  I want, I'm looking for more.  Real.  That's just weird.  That was Chrisco.  Like a real, the real guns.  Like a real gun that, you know, just in the movie.  How about RoboCop's gun?  Yeah, that's not real.  That is a fucking great gun, dude.  That's pretty cool.  The shit that comes out of his leg.  It's the, uh, it's a machine pistol.  Yeah.  Great fucking gun.  That is a, that might be a top. 
[04:51:00]  Yeah, that's a good movie gun.  That's a top gun, man.  That's cool.  That's coming in.  That's a top gun.  Uh, Scott from New York has one.  Scott?  Hey, boys, how about, hey, Anthony, you know that movie Runaway with Gene Simmons?  Remember that guy?  Oh, yeah, yeah, with the, uh, the little missile that came out of the gun.  Oh, right.  All right, so if you're going to get magical guns, fucking Judge Dredd's gun.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  The one that he talks to, that he makes, you know, grenade or, or, well, I was thinking 
[04:51:30]  more regular guns.  Yeah, real, real kind of guns.  There's a lot, there's a lot of great, uh, fucking magical guns.  I mean, uh, Terminator, when you first see Terminator, he's the, that's the first movie  to ever have the, uh, laser scope.  Yeah, yeah.  And the laser scope make the, made the gun look better than it really was.  Oh, right, yeah.  When he put that thing right on her head.  For, oh, man, I know I'm jerking that movie off, but he had a fucking sawed off 12 gauge 
[04:52:00]  pump shotgun with a silencer on it.  Yeah, that thing was sick.  A pump shotgun with a silencer on it was phenomenal.  That thing was twisted.  Well, then you got the, the, the other thing he was using.  I don't even know what the fuck you call it.  It was, it's, it's to kill, it's to kill cows, but he was knocking the locks off out  of doors.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And, well, he used it on occasion to pop someone's head open with it.  I was pretty fucked up.  I would also say there's a few guns from Commando that are spectacular.  Yeah. 
[04:52:30]  He has a couple of really good guns in Commando.  I'm sure Arnold Schwarzenegger probably pound for pound.  Uh, uh, Sam Jackson has a good gun in, um, in Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction, yeah.  He has a great, he has a great gun.  Made Ringo's look like a little piece of shit when he grabbed it and put that big fucking  gun in his face.  He has a great gun in that movie.  Yeah.  Um, I, I personally, uh, that was a cool one too that, uh, John Travolta had that he  left on the counter.  That little machine pistol Uzi with the big silencer on it. 
[04:53:00]  Yeah.  Uh, but you just brought up Desperado.  Hmm.  The, the, the wrist, the spring loaded ones.  Oh, right, right.  Desperado.  Yeah.  That had a lot of cool.  Well, that's also Taxi Driver.  He had that whole thing where he had it on the little rails that came out into his hand,  but they were just regular guns.  How about the first time you ever saw the .357, uh, or the one, the Clint Eastwood.  Dirty Harry.  Dirty Harry stuff.  Yeah.  First time you saw that one. 
[04:53:30]  .357, that was like the.  Dirty Harry in the last movie had a great gun.  That was a .357 when they shot his dog Meathead and he was standing there and the gun was almost  at his feet when he had it down.  Yeah.  It was the longest barrel gun you've ever seen.  Yeah, that big barrel.  Let's go to Jason in Oregon.  Jason.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, one of the best guns ever in a movie has to be out of Jackal, man.  Oh, shit, man. 
[04:54:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, the Jack, uh, that wasn't the one with Bruce Willis, was it?  Yeah, Bruce Willis.  That was a great fucking gun.  It was a .50.  Damn, I don't remember that one.  It was like a, uh, it was a, and this is the gun I dream about killing people with.  I do a lot of dreaming about killing.  I don't, like, but, like, very, uh, my killing is very, uh, uh, what's the word?  It's, it's, what's the word I'm looking for, man?  It's, it's not a bullshit just murdering anybody.  It's, like, very quality killing.  Calculated and. 
[04:54:30]  Very, like, I don't want to say anything to get me in trouble.  Very, like, necessary.  You die.  You die.  You die.  Like, like, very Jesus-y.  Very coming back.  Very, you're helping the world.  Yes.  Very coming back.  Like, I dream about being on the news making a, a announcement of who's going to die.  No one can stop me.  Um, who's going to die and in what order, and there's nothing you can do about it.  I'm going to get people that deserve to die, and, and, and starting with this guy.  And I say it on the news.  No one can stop me.  And the gun that this guy's talking about is the gun I use to kill people. 
[04:55:00]  It's a remote-controlled, um, super gun where you sit and you, it has a camera.  You can sit about, you know, you can be a mile away, and you sit in your car.  Oh, man.  And it's almost video game type.  You, you put it in a van, and you just, uh, you, you kill people with a gun or put it in a building.  And you remote-control the, the, the, the killing.  And I, and I, and I dream about, you know, end of your life guy, but on a higher level, like. 
[04:55:30]  Dude, that would be a great movie right there.  Uh.  That's pretty cool.  Serial killer with, like, a freaking remote-controlled gun.  Remote-controlled gun.  But there's, there's, there's been a couple of, you know, that movie Shooter with, um.  Was like that?  Yeah, you had a remote-controlled gun, you know, you could just, you just.  Right.  With a little pin.  And, and, and, you know, you just.  I don't know, I, I don't know, man.  End of your life, guys, is a very attractive thing to me.  I don't know why.  Just because some people, you know, there was this, this cunt at, uh, the, the DMV that just, you know, you know, not that you want to kill her. 
[04:56:00]  She should, you know, her family should cry.  But just, you know, kill you and then bring you back to life to say, do you see.  And say, see that.  The options.  How quickly that could have happened.  Like, for you to just arbitrarily be a cunt to me.  Because I find, you know, I have less of a problem with dudes in public, in service position.  Dudes don't act.  You know, when you're on the phone, it seems like dudes are more helpful on the phone when you're dealing with cable or you're dealing with the telephone company. 
[04:56:30]  It just seems like women are just miserable.  Just a miserable, uh, creature.  And, and, and, and not to get into that, but it's like sometimes you just want to, you just want to kill them all the time.  You know, and just to, just to say there's an, there's an option out there just to, just to do something fucked up.  Now, I want to say certain people, uh, jobs, which you can get in trouble for even fucking announcing that.  So it's like, I would just love to.  Yeah.  Just to, just to say I did it. 
[04:57:00]  Let's go to Crotch Critter.  He's got Anthony's gun.  That's the Osama bin Laden.  That would be a fun thing.  Wouldn't you like to just say the doctor tells you, uh, you got a year to live.  Uh, you, you'll be healthy up until you die, but you got a year to live.  Who wouldn't want to just pack up, go to Afghanistan and just give it a whirl.  Take it a shot.  Take a shot.  Just take a shot at it.  What about this?  What about Walker?  That's your, that's your, that's your bucket list.  That's my bucket list right there.  That's a much better bucket list. 
[04:57:30]  If I'm told, I'm taking it.  Who cares about the Grand Canyon?  I'm, I'm, I'm grabbing every penny out of the bank.  I'm, I'm fucking chartering a plane.  Drop me somewhere.  Would you kill him if you knew you was going to die?  If I knew, if you knew you was going to die in, in, in, in an attempt to kill him, in an  attempt to kill him, would you go and kill him?  I guess you knew you was going to get shot.  I think the adrenaline would take over.  If I was, you would do that.  If you're at the point where you're there and ready to kill him, I guess you're not  going to go like, yeah, like you mean he's, he's got people around him. 
[04:58:00]  There's going to be no getting away from it, but you got the shot.  You are going to die.  You blow his head off and you, the only way to kill him is to get, then you have to die  too.  You have a, um, wait a minute.  Before I forget.  Wait a minute.  One second.  Let's not like what I'm thinking of is made me think of a gun in the line of fire.  Ah, a fucking wooden gun that he made with just two bullets.  Oh, that thing.  Yeah.  That little carved a gun.  Yeah. 
[04:58:30]  That, uh, what's his name?  Uh, Michael, John McEvich.  Uh, now you have that gun.  That's a hell of a memory, by the way.  Jesus.  You have that gun walking up on Osama.  Bin Laden, yeah.  Bin Laden.  You walk up on him.  You got two bullets.  You got to get this close to him, bust him in the head.  And after you're done, you go, well, I'm out of, you know, no more bullets.  And you're waiting to get fucking.  Here it is.  You're waiting to get not only shot, but probably really fucked up by the arrows. 
[04:59:00]  See, here it is.  A real ass fucking.  That's what I mean.  Now, if you were just going to die in a blaze of frigging gunfire, that's one thing.  If you off Osama bin Laden, then you got to fucking wait while they saw your fucking head off.  Dad, you go.  How are you going to do that?  No.  Ain't happening.  Ain't happening.  I am not getting my head sawn off.  How about this?  So, you know, a soldier out there that might end up killing Osama bin Laden, right? 
[04:59:30]  When he comes back to America, does he ever get a traffic ticket again?  If they know who it is, no.  Yeah, if they ever know.  How far can he go when he comes back to America?  I'm just saying this is all dumb talk.  He would have to begin with.  He would have to market it.  I'd be like, dude, don't pay.  Would you ever pay for another meal?  Don't pay taxes.  Don't pay for anything.  You know what?  That's the same token as saying the guys that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.  I don't think his life would change for two seconds. 
[05:00:00]  But, you know, I think he'll be just a regular dude.  You saw Fog of War, right?  Yeah.  Where one of these guys, he was like, he was the shit back in the day.  And they show him stuck in traffic in Washington.  I'm like, man, I'm thinking if you were the shit back in the day that you would never have  to worry about any of that crap ever again.  He's in the rain.  He's in traffic.  He's one of the most powerful guys in the world.  He was at the time.  And now he's just a regular dude, like, stuck in traffic.  Old guy in traffic.  Like we are.  And that just was interesting to me. 
[05:00:30]  I'm just I'm still hung up on this whole Osama bin Laden thing.  Like it would have to be the wooden pistol, one bullet next to him.  And you fucking have nothing else.  You got close to him.  They checked you a couple of times.  And what happened is they left.  They checked you before.  It was like 10 of them checking you.  Because you remember in In the Line of Fire, he had the bullets in a rabbit's foot.  Right.  He had all the things.  And he was able to put it all together. 
[05:01:00]  And he put it together under a table.  So you get in.  You got a camera.  They checked that.  You have like something on your hat.  The feather is like a bullet.  Yeah.  Fucking your keys are like, you know, whatever.  And you can make a little gun with one bullet in it.  You're an interviewer.  He got one fucking goofy guy.  You interview him for about 45 minutes.  They're comfortable with you.  You take out that wooden pistol.  And then.  Blowie.  And now you're just chilling like, and now what?  You can't save one for yourself?  Like, bam, bam.  No suicide plans. 
[05:01:30]  Damn it.  Damn it.  That's rough because they are going to fuck you up.  You're not going to just die.  See, that's it.  It's like, oh, would you die to take him out?  Under a certain circumstance, sure.  But you're talking about would you go through unimaginable pain  and then a horrific death before, you know, you die after killing him?  I don't think I'd be ready to have my head sewn off.  Here's another ethical catch. 
[05:02:00]  Uh-huh.  Ready?  Yeah.  You, this is not on TV.  So basically, they're never going to tell the world that you fucking killed Osama.  And they're going to cut your fucking head off unceremoniously.  So now you're just a piece of, you're a body dumped in a river.  Oh.  And, and no one might, because we already think that motherfucker's already dead.  And no one knows he's even dead.  So you.  It just goes like, you know you killed him. 
[05:02:30]  You know you killed him.  But you're dead.  So.  You, you're the only one.  They burn his body.  Yes.  So no one knows like, that he ever was killed.  Like the Hitler death.  He'll just always be a mystery.  People still think he's alive in his little bunker, like, walking around.  That's not unreasonable to think.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty good.  Because then that brings the whole sin of vanity and pride into the whole thing. 
[05:03:00]  That's, that's a tough question.  Because you would want some kind of recognition, especially if you're going to pay the supreme sacrifice for it.  No.  I say no.  I want to, I want people to fucking know at least that he's dead.  Maybe some, you know, for them to go, someone did it.  All right.  So you have some posthumous fucking accolade.  It wouldn't even have to be recognition that I did it.  But there would have to be confirmation that he did get killed. 
[05:03:30]  I got one.  That somebody got through and killed him.  I got one.  I got one.  All right.  So you, you killed Bin Laden.  But at the last second, they, they say they're going to spare your life and you don't die for killing Bin Laden.  But for the rest of your life.  You can't tell.  No.  Everyone knows.  But for the rest of your life, you have to suck cock.  Jesus Christ.  What?  You can't.  I get to kill Bin Laden if I can suck dick. 
[05:04:00]  But now I have to suck dick and it's the only way I get to live.  Would you take that?  You have to.  That sounds like something the Muslims would come up with over there.  Right.  Yeah.  Sure.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That turned heroically gay.  Yeah.  What happened?  Oh, but why did it have to go heroically gay?  Just to, you know, throw a little curveball.  He's a war hero.  He's a war hero, but.  Fucking guy right there.  You see him?  He's a cocksucker.  Yeah.  Dude.  He killed fucking Bin Laden.  He has to now do that.  So just give him a pass. 
[05:04:30]  That gay guy.  He has no choice.  Okay.  You're heterosexual, but now you're that gay guy that killed Bin Laden.  Yeah.  I don't even know if that's bad, but it's bad for your, again, your own pride.  Right.  But it's set up in such a way, if you don't suck the cock, you die instantly.  Oh, you have to suck a dick there.  No, just all the time now.  How are they going to know?  Once you get back to the U.S. and you go, ah.  No, no, no, no.  I'll suck the dick to get out of that beheading.  I mean, when you get back to the States. 
[05:05:00]  My promise?  Suck my dick.  Any guy out there is sucking a dick to keep from getting his head sawn off.  You know how many Arabs is getting their fucking balls licked to get me out of that beheading?  And then I get home and I go, I killed Bin Laden.  How'd you get away?  Had to suck 65 insurgents' dicks.  It's nothing worse than insurgent balls.  Right.  On your nose.  It was a circle jerk over me with insurgent balls. 
[05:05:30]  The second someone looks at you sideways, you play a video of someone getting their head  cut off and go, look, that's the option.  That was the option, motherfucker.  I'd have fucking gone down like a man fucking had my...  Yeah, would you?  I'm doing rusty trombones all up and down Afghanistan coastline.  Till I get home.  All the way to the border.  And I'm like, you know, you tell your girl a man's got to do what a man's got to do, bitch.  That's the Congo line.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do. 
[05:06:00]  Another dick.  Just a bunch of fucking insurgents calling you my friend.  I just had to kind of...  My friend, my friend, my friend.  Mow it up.  Oh my God.  It's like when you get home, you still have to suck dick.  Like, fuck that.  Like, you're going against your word, my friend.  Just eat my ass.  I'm saying, like, there's an Al-Qaeda ghost that just follows you around constantly.  Operative.  And he kills you if you don't continue.  Kill fucking Bin Laden. 
[05:06:30]  I'll kill him too.  No, no, no.  Oh, like, mine is far-fetched, but some of the shit you came up with isn't.  It's not as far-fetched.  As an Al-Qaeda guy making sure you're only sucking dick.  What is a...  What did I say that was far-fetcher than fucking dick sucking?  Al-Qaeda ghost?  You break your...  You promised to suck dick.  With an Al-Qaeda ghost looking over you.  What's wrong with that?  Get the fuck out of here.  My built... 
[05:07:00]  My fucking built gun to kill Bin Laden.  Yeah, that's far-fetched.  My fucking wooden gun that I carved to kill Bin Laden.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.
