<pre> Opie Anthony, we recorded a number of their messages on tape, but one of the messages appears to be a fan of attack.  Bizarre at 1027.  It is Opie Anthony, hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us.  We're cracking each other up as the music's playing.  Oh my god, unfortunately we can't say the stuff on the air. 
[00:30]
 You ever just say the most politically incorrect thing in the world just to shock your friend?  Oh my god, you can't say that. It's like someone turns to you and goes, you can't say that.  It's like, you just can't. But, deja vu?  It's exactly what I said yesterday when I was trying to explain myself about the, you know, Bill's dead phone call.  There are times you're hanging out with your pals and you'll, like you just said, you'll say something to really shock them.  Yeah, but that's saying something amongst your friends, not dragging in a more innocent bystander. 
[01:00]
 If you say, let's say we were all sitting here in the studio and we made some kind of ethnically disparaging remark,  which you just did, I'm not saying we did that, let's just say we did.  Let's just say we did.  Oh my god, that was funny.  See, the difference is we're all shocked and then laugh at how outrageous it is.  That's different than inviting a person of that ethnic background in the studio and then saying it. 
[01:30]
 See, that's the same thing as you with your phone call.  Look at the Reverend Al sticking his head in the door. We weren't talking about your people.  Oh no.  We weren't talking about your people. It was someone else.  What remark was made? I demand an investigation.  I demand an inquiry into what goes on behind the scenes of the Orby and Anthony show. 
[02:00]
 It's bad enough to listen to the outrageous remarks of you two on there.  Now you say you're making ethnically disparaging remarks off there.  But it wasn't about your people, so that's okay, right?  I am outraged. I'm sure it was about my people.  No, no, it wasn't.  I am positive. No, it wasn't.  This is just like the Louima case. What goes on behind closed doors? 
[02:30]
 I feel violated and I want vindication. I am outraged.  You can tell how outraged I am by going to my website, ReverendAl.com,  where you can tell all the happenings of Reverend Al.  Be sure you click on my banners, I get a penny a pop.  I need money to wear these almighty suits when I don't have a job.  And for your entertainment, I also have a couple of fun little computer games you can play on the Reverend Al website. 
[03:00]
 Yeah? Yeah. Here's another one called March Through New York City.  Watch it, here goes Reverend Al marching.  Uh-oh, here come the police.  Oh, the Reverend Al didn't make it to the final destination, the Palo Theater.  But it'll be fun.  All right, Reverend Al, we weren't talking about your people, all right? 
[03:30]
 I am outraged.  All right, get out of here.  Who were you making disparaging remarks about?  Um, the Asians.  Oh, that's okay, I got a good one.  Yeah.  Reverend Al, ladies and gentlemen.  There he goes, Reverend Al.  Big fat ass ass.  Telling us Asian jokes.  While we're on this racial topic, Tamar, on the Instant Feedback, Tamar from Brooklyn.  She's been, I assume it's a female, she's been emailing me the last couple days, and she writes in the Instant Feedback, again, question for the OP, for the sexy OP. 
[04:00]
 Jesus.  What's up with you saying you want a black girl before you get married? Wouldn't you marry one if she made you happy? I don't get it. Help me understand you. Love you guys.  Oh, that's an interesting point.  But I want to understand what you mean. Well, it's a-  What's an interesting point?  It's one of my fantasies, fetishes, if you will, to be with a black lady before I get married. 
[04:30]
 Really?  And I say it that way because most likely I'm going to marry a Puerto Rican.  So I'm not putting down the black race.  You want to enjoy the pleasures of a black woman before I marry-  Before you marry a Puerto Rican.  And she was saying, how come you've written off marrying a black woman? 
[05:00]
 Because most likely I'm going to be marrying a Puerto Rican.  Okay. Hold dirty?  No. The sad part is this is the truth.  So sad about that. You don't look like an ethnically diverse person.  You don't really look like the type of- you look like you should be marrying the-  Man, I'll tell you one thing.  At least going out with the girl that's the high school homecoming queen in Harborfield, you know?  Well, instead, if I marry Sandy and we have kids, they're going to pop out like Carrot Top. 
[05:30]
 With her wild nappy hair and my red features.  I don't know if Sandy would appreciate you saying she has nappy hair.  With those banana curls of hers, our kids are going to look like they're plantain curls.  They're going to look like Carrot Top.  Sandy has lovely hair. 
[06:00]
 Yes, she does.  I don't know what you're saying.  Oh my God.  Well, it's a little nappy at times.  You guys are like West Side Story.  Tonight, tonight.  Forget that boy and find another.  One of your own kind, stick to your own kind.  But answer your question tomorrow.  Boy like that who killed your brother.  Forget that boy and find another. 
[06:30]
 One of your own kind, stick to your own kind.  But answer your question tomorrow.  Forget that boy and find another.  But I hope that answered her question.  If I still say, the way to not.  You are.  What if I still say, you're little Maria.  Maria, Sandy, I just met a girl.  And then like her family and friends could get the gang together and you could get yours and they could rumble. 
[07:00]
 Yeah, that'd be fun.  You guys can translate.  Kiss me off.  What up, Anthony?  Eddie.  This is 1027WATW.  No more of that FM talk crap. 
[07:30]
 We called you yesterday.  You didn't believe us, did you?  You didn't believe us, did you?  No, but it's true.  I made a decision yesterday.  Not that anything's, I don't know, what's changing as far as the show, Opie?  Nothing.  Don't worry.  Once again, they keep slapping a new name on the package, but don't you, Fred.  Your pals are still here doing the same thing.  And we don't even know what that is, but we're doing the same exact thing.  But I told you, man, we're doing these high profile meetings now. 
[08:00]
 High profile?  Well, Anthony...  What are you doing? Oh my God.  Anthony's not, but I am.  Anthony's got a slate.  I bet he gets here before 1.30.  1.30, first of all, ass.  Here we go.  I'm usually here by quarter to one.  Yeah, call me weird. I'm so sensitive.  You're sensitive. Am I sensitive?  When are we allowed to play the audio of you doing the New Year's show? 
[08:30]
 You can play that anytime you want.  It's so boring, dude.  It's boring?  See? See? There's like nothing to it. It wasn't any, you're not going to...  Dude, not over the board.  Watch your finger, man.  And watch your thumb. Oh, Opie with tools scares the crap out of me.  Shut up. I can do that.  Oh, you're so sensitive.  Opie is hacksawing the FM talk at 1027 mic flag off the mic.  And of course, don't let the shutting the mic off or doing it at any spots. 
[09:00]
 So everyone can just hear...  You proved you could do the show without me. Just keep talking.  Oh yeah. And wait a minute, Rick. What do you mean boring?  The whole thing was boring? You didn't like my rap?  No, no, no.  It was arduous to get through the tape because Earl recorded everything.  They're talking all the music. So it's not segmented.  So I don't know where the hell to stop the damn tape.  Okay.  Is there any wires in the middle of this thing?  Oh yeah, there are electric wires.  Don't cut the... 
[09:30]
 Is there an easier way to get this mic flag off?  Yeah, you undo the screw at the bottom.  Oh.  See the little wing nut?  All right, I'll do that.  Now the whole mic is going to fall, so you have to hold that.  I know.  Remember the time I was working the mic and it fell off in my hand?  No problem.  That came loose.  That came loose.  Okay.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, just let it hang by the wire.  There it goes in the trash.  Would you throw the hacksaw away, Tony? 
[10:00]
 Yeah, I don't need it.  There you go. Now at least we can see it.  Wow, Ed, that's what you look like.  How are you, man?  How did they put that big thing on and we couldn't even see each other?  I haven't seen you in like three months.  It's like the scene from Caddyshack.  Ed and I...  Ed and I tried to do this...  God damn it.  Sit down, Dennis.  Hold on, someone hold that.  I'm serious.  Dude, what happened to this thing?  Girl.  Oh, there it is.  What, the...  There it is.  Can't get it in the hole?  I can get it in the hole, jackass. 
[10:30]
 There he goes.  You want to start talking about your gay roommate right off the bat, Mark?  Fine, let's go ahead.  I don't care.  And other things?  All right.  There we go.  Wow, honestly, I can see you now, Ed.  Yeah, this is kind of cool.  There was a big block there for so long.  And before you guys call us a bunch of homos, no, you need to see the other guy when you do a radio show so you don't step all over him.  Exactly.  Can't be just talking with a big block in front of your face. 
[11:00]
 Imagine that, go to a bar with your pals, right?  Put a big block in front of everybody's face and then try to carry on a conversation.  That's what we do here.  And just like Caddyshack, you know, we're kind of looking around the block, but the other guy's looking the other way.  Danny.  Sit down, Danny.  And then he just kind of wipes them off the desk.  Right.  Now we're okay now.  Now we're all right.  The block is out of our face.  I see the little things up all over the place.  1027 WNEW. 
[11:30]
 Website, WNEW.com.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  See, that's a lot easier.  There's still nothing on it, but at least we can give out the address and people will understand it.  FM Talk.  Is there anything good on it?  www.wnew.com.  Is there anything good on it?  No, I'm serious because the website blew.  So what do you mean there's good stuff on there?  It's the same website.  Neneh.  It's not as good as our underground website. 
[12:00]
 That's for sure.  Everyone commenting, by the way, about all the new stuff on the unofficial website.  Yeah.  The pictures of you in a fur coat is a big hit.  I think it's a hit.  With our faithful listeners.  Steve that runs the site sent me an email saying, oh my God, you poor sorry bastard.  What an upbringing.  And he's amazed I even gave him the disk with those pictures on it.  Yeah.  So he may share it with millions of people.  It is pretty scary.  Well, if you want to share, I'll bring in some pictures of myself that are pretty horrifying as well. 
[12:30]
 So well, we had spoken about me wearing the fur coat when I was a little kid.  My mom bought it for me much to my chagrin.  I really didn't want to wear it, but I'm a kid.  You know, you've got to wear what your parents make you wear.  And we talked about it on the air and my cousin Anthony came up with a picture of it.  And who am I to censor that from our listeners?  If a picture exists of something we talked about, why not?  The funniest part of the picture, you can't tell who is Anthony. 
[13:00]
 Yeah.  And your sister's involved in this.  It's you, your brother and Dawn.  You can't tell which one's Anthony in that photo.  When I was a kid, especially with the fur coat, I would go out to restaurants and stuff.  And the waitress or waiter would come over and, and what would the young lady like to you?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Thanks a lot.  I used to get that.  I'm a boy.  I'm a man. 
[13:30]
 You bitch.  I didn't cross dress in a wreck.  I used to get that.  Until like six months ago.  I finally had it.  I had to cut my hair.  Really?  From behind.  I was always getting ma'am and I turn around and getting all pissed off, have a goatee and stuff.  Do I look like a ma'am?  Well, you shaved your goatee off that you had over vacation.  Yes.  You're one of those guys that vacation, you let it grow a little bit and then you come back to work and shave it right off. 
[14:00]
 Well, I didn't want to look like you, Anthony.  Well, that's pretty impossible.  You're the goatee man.  Yeah.  So when I grow the goatee, then everyone goes, what, you trying to copy Anthony?  So what did you do?  I just, I didn't shave over vacation?  Yeah, it started really hurting.  Actually, I shaved it because I was looking too much like Spaz.  You had the exact same goatee.  I'm like, wait, something's not right here.  Okay.  I look just like my hero.  After all, he likes me better than you.  Well, we all know that. 
[14:30]
 That's fine by me.  Max, what's going on?  How are you doing?  What's going on, Anthony?  Hey.  All right.  Listen, I got some advice for you.  I just heard a little while ago that you said you wanted to bed down with a black woman before you tied the knot.  Yeah, without a doubt.  All right.  I got some advice for you.  Understand this, that once you go black, you don't go back.  You never go back.  All right.  What's up with that?  Now, what's up with that?  I mean, depending on the girl and how strong she is, because once she finds out that you're a celebrity and you are, whether you have a major following or a cult following, you are a celebrity. 
[15:00]
 You belong to the world.  She won't try to run.  She won't try to put the serious moves on you.  Uh-oh.  The serious moves, oh.  That's right.  And I'm telling you right now, that's something to, uh, that's something to behold.  Take it from me.  I am a black man.  All right.  I'm just going to, like, get a black hooker, I think.  He's just going to bang.  Oh, man, it don't matter whether it's a hooker or not, man.  It don't matter what hooker.  I'm going to grow my goatee.  No one's going to know it's me.  And I'm going to get a black hooker.  It don't matter, though, man. 
[15:30]
 I'm telling you right now, once she finds out that you're a celebrity, she's going to try to put the moves on you.  I'm going to get some of that purple fruit.  Oh.  The purple winged bat.  Oh, you're funny.  You're funny.  So do you have any advice as far as picking up a black chick?  No.  He's telling you to lay low on it.  He doesn't want you to do it.  I'm just going to put it to you like this.  If you heard the saying, keep it real.  Right.  Just keep it real.  Don't try to do nothing serious and extravagant. 
[16:00]
 Only unless this chick is also a raw, raw mess, is she rowdy or something like that, then you turn around and you can go over one of the other.  Oh, boy.  Now, great, boy.  Just be yourself.  Hope's got to come off like a scrub.  No, he ain't got to come off like no scrub.  Just be yourself.  Just be real.  If you ain't real, man, then you ain't going nowhere.  I just don't want the relationship.  I just want the bang.  No, no, no.  You ain't.  No, that's the key.  That's the key right there.  You ain't looking for no relationship.  You ain't looking for no relationship.  You're just snagging that black ass while you're riding it, Hope.  Imagine that.  And you're a pretty, a white guy. 
[16:30]
 Yeah, that's pretty fair.  I mean, you're pretty fair skinned.  So imagine what the contrast would be like.  I'm not a pretty boy ass.  I said pretty in the terms of like mostly pretty white boy.  Oh, because I'm saying if you're a pretty boy, then you ain't going to have no problem  picking up no black girl.  I'm going to say that right now.  Let me tell you something.  In the past, I went to black bars trying to get the deed done.  Now, you got to go to the laundromat, Hope.  No, no.  Why?  No, no, no, no, no.  You see, y'all need to hook up with me, man. 
[17:00]
 I'll take you to some places.  I ain't talking about no squeeze buckets either.  Well, it'll be in the back alley like Rolls with your wallet missing.  Well, the deal is no one can find out about this.  See, I'm in a relationship, so I got to do it on the side.  All right, no doubt.  We can do this on a hush hush.  Yeah, all right.  A hush hush.  You're saying you?  I mean, look, you name the designated place and the designated time, and we can designate  some ass.  All right?  Put this smear on me, all right?  I'd like to scare the crap out of you, Hope. 
[17:30]
 I think it would scare the living daylights out of you.  That would be part of the beauty of it, Anthony.  Yeah?  Hell yeah.  I think it would end up like, remember when the little pregnant chick came in and danced  for you?  You thought you wanted it right up until that happened?  I think that's exactly what would happen.  You'd get in bed, she'd be like, come on, sugar.  Come on, give me some, baby.  Come on, Hope.  And you'd be like, I'm not into this anymore.  I got to go.  I can't stay.  So what is it?  You accepted my invitation? 
[18:00]
 Well, honestly, that was an old bet that we played.  Oh, see, you're backing out already?  That was a while ago.  I got to reassess the situation and decide if I still want that.  How could you measure up?  Right.  You know?  She probably used the black guys.  I listen to y'all every day, so when you regroup yourself and you're ready to go, right, I  will definitely be giving you a call.  All right, Max, thank you.  Easy.  All right.  Easy.  Easy.  Is that the new one in the community?  I guess.  Roger, you're next.  27W, N-E-W. 
[18:30]
 Great, Spaz.  Roger.  Yeah.  It's Hope and Anthony.  You're live.  Let's go.  Hey, man, what's happening, guys?  You thought it was Spaz even without the go to you.  Yeah, man, exactly.  So what's up?  If he's wrestling career, if anything like his phone voice, he's going to suck.  Listen, man, you got to watch out for them black women.  They're fine.  They'll take you for everything you got.  How's that?  How's that?  Are you married?  Are you married to black chick?  Black chick more.  Hello? 
[19:00]
 Excuse me.  Oh, she took his phone.  She's taking it right now.  Exactly.  She got me.  All right.  So what happened?  You married the black chick?  Married the black chick.  We went to St. Patty's Day parade and fell in love with her and she took me for everything  I got.  Still married to her, two great kids and guess what?  Little Z-Post.  The house is in her name too.  Oh, that's stupid.  Yeah, that's stupid.  Two words, pre-nup.  Pre-nup.  All right, Roger.  Talking about a what? 
[19:30]
 Roger, one.  All right, Roger.  I'm hanging up on Roger.  I'll tell you why.  Because he's listening to the damn radio as he tries to talk to us.  You know, we're making changes around here, left and right, changing things.  For the new millennium.  But the deal is we still have a 40-second delay as we speak.  So if you have the radio on and you're trying to get on the show and you're trying to talk  to us, we're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. 
[20:00]
 We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show.  Look at that.  ONA Radio, 24 hours a day.  See the radio message board, Opie, jumping with the news that it is true.  It is N.E.W., W.N.E.W., not F.M. Talk.  They said they heard it on our show yesterday, but didn't believe it until they heard the  radio chick talking about it.  Well, she's more credible.  We have no credibility.  That's okay. 
[20:30]
 We don't want credibility.  Yet we get fired for fake news stories.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  Life's not fair, Ethel.  It isn't.  It is not.  Well, it's kind of nice to see that you guys finally believe that we're doing live radio  shows again.  Yeah, they're calling.  You guys are calling.  Yesterday, we had to say what?  Ten or twelve times that we're live, and the phones weren't ringing at all.  People thought it was a tape.  And then when the phones did ring, it was people requesting worst of bits.  Yeah.  So it's good to know that you guys are here. 
[21:00]
 You're calling in, and you finally believe we're back from vacation.  Even though we kept saying the date.  I know.  We even said the date.  It's January 4th today.  So Parcells stepped down.  Yeah.  A little bit of controversy there.  Well, we'll get into that a little later.  Yeah, well, we'll get into it for hours.  How am I going to add on to the band?  They've got to just be going insane over there.  Well, they're happy.  They needed something.  To them, like Parcells stepping down and actually getting on the air with them and stuff, is 
[21:30]
 like 20 chicks coming in here and shooting eggs out of their most intimate areas.  That is like a coup for them.  You know those shows where we're high fiving, there's nudity, and just debauchery?  Yeah, and everyone's playing.  It's kind of their homeless shopping spree.  Right.  You know?  Look at that, Maggie!  We got Parcells!  Look at this!  It's just better than eggs shooting out of the egg!  They've been discussing Parcells resigning for the last 24 hours.  Yes.  And they'll keep going.  They love it over there. 
[22:00]
 And Bobby Bo.  Excuse me.  As we do a quick sports break here, my dream came true.  Gonzo.  Bobby Bonilla.  Out of here!  They hated him so much.  You see the deal he got in the paper?  They're going to be paying him until the year like 2030.  I'm not kidding!  Get the paper!  Get the paper!  They just wanted him out.  They wanted him out just like pretty much every Met fan in the tri-state area.  They made a deal where they pretty much are going to be paying him until like 2030, Anthony.  Wow, sounds like our last P.D.  With that, let's take a quick break and we'll get into the Bonilla thing and everything 
[22:30]
 else.  It's Opie and Anthony.  If you want in on the show today, 212-757-1027.  Opie.  What is it going to take for us to fish you off to the point where you're going to change  the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on the show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie.  Anthony.  Opie.  Anthony.  Anthony.  It sure is easy to be a fag on the show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony.  We just received a Ph.D. in stupidity. 
[23:00]
 1-0-2-7.  1-0-2-7-W-A-W. It's Opie and Anthony.  We are back.  We are live.  It's January 4th, 2000.  Yes, it is.  Top of the millennium to you and yours.  We're here, live.  A lot of people were confused yesterday, as Opie said, but now we're here live.  It's been a long time, right?  It's been five days.  Four days, five days.  Why, did you get some on New Year's Eve?  Let me figure it out.  Did you bang in the New Year?  No, I didn't bang in the New Year.  Let's see. 
[23:30]
 A couple days before.  What day is today?  The 4th.  The 4th.  2 plus 4 is the 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.

[32:00]
 The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  The 4th.  Wow.  Are you pissed off at any of the races that live and breathe around us here in New York  City?  No, I hate everyone.  You hate everyone?  Go ahead, pick a race.  I say breathe, not breed, ass.  You'd better have a John Rocker there for a minute.  Breathe?  What are you talking about?  The Puerto Ricans?  Alright, well I get it.  Oh, Murray Gunn.  Are you saying the Puerto Ricans have a lot of children?  I'm thinking so.  Alright, so Steve, the pissed off Asian just took a shot at the Puerto Ricans. 
[32:30]
 There's all you Puerto Ricans out there, you know, effing around in those G.O's all stuffed  up.  Now you're making fun of their cars?  Isn't it great living in a melting pot such as this where we can all hate different people?  You're not making fun of their Toyotas, are you?  With the small little steering wheels?  Yeah, the Tercells or something.  Yeah, the Toyota Corolla and the Celica GTs with the little skateboard wheels on them?  Oh, and the blue neon light.  You need the blue neon light reflecting off the bottom of the car? 
[33:00]
 What the hell have they got there?  I want to illuminate my drive shaft, man, with blue neon light.  And you need the license plate with the chaser red lights going around it?  I guess it confuses the hell out of the cops when they're chasing them.  I can't get the plate number, there's some red lights spinning around it.  It's making me dizzy.  It's making me nauseous.  Just let them go.  And then of course it's got to be tinted with flat black paint from Pergamon, the window tint. 
[33:30]
 Sure.  Spoiler on the rear hood, on the rear trunk lid, because you never know when you're going  to get one of those Toyota Corollas with their four cylinder engines up to about 260.  It could leave the roadway at any moment.  And thank God we're in the off season.  All the Puerto Ricans can now see out their back window because Sammy Sosa's not hitting  any homers.  And then how about the little crown air freshener on the dashboard?  Sure.  The little crown.  And then you need your Jesus Christ headlight stencils.  That is the best thing I've ever seen. 
[34:00]
 You ever see the Jesus Christ headlight stencil?  It's over the headlight and it's Jesus' face.  Like, wow, that is pretty cool.  I need that.  Jesus' headlight stencil.  Well, Steve, thank you very much.  I've got a joke for you guys.  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay, how do you stop crime?  I have a million man march every day.  I think he was just goofing on the blacks.  I know.  You're our new Asian friend, Steve.  You already took the...  No, but I've been on blackout before.  You already took your shot at the Puerto Ricans. 
[34:30]
 And on the line we have a bunch of pissed off Puerto Ricans thanks to you, Steve.  No problem.  All right, man.  Hey, Steve.  You guys rock.  Steve.  Yeah?  Do you have a last name like Chang or Wang?  It's just, you know, throw a walk down the stairs.  Walk?  Yeah?  Throw a walk down the stairs.  You know, it's funny when you're like, you throw a walk down the stairs and whatever  sound it makes, pang, pang, pang, pang.  That's really funny.  What's your name be?  Pang, pang, pang, pang, pang, pang, pang.  Hey, do we have anything we could throw to make it sound like a Chinese name? 
[35:00]
 Get us a pot.  Get us a pot or like a calendar or something.  We're going to give you a new name.  We're going to give you a new name so when you call.  I always think it's pretty funny when, you know, an Asian guy with the last name that's  like Chong Feng, has a first name like Steve.  Or you know, it's my name is Bob.  Bob Chang Feng.  You know, of course it's a pseudonym.  And why do you guys talk like a model airplane?  That's the women.  I don't get it. 
[35:30]
 At least I'm not spitting out 10,000 words a second like the Puerto Ricans.  Oh, he doesn't like Puerto Ricans.  See, at first you guys, you know, you didn't want to admit that you didn't like anyone  and now you're really pissed off at the Puerto Ricans.  Okay.  All right.  Here, give that to him.  Let's see if this works.  It's not actually a pot though.  No.  It's made of metal.  We'll give it a try.  All right.  We got a big, huge metal stool.  Okay.  Here we go. 
[36:00]
 That was like a Chang Feng.  Chang Feng.  All right.  Steve Chang Feng.  All right.  Steve, we got to let you go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You guys rock.  Well, we'll continue this Anthony because now we got a bunch of pissed off Puerto Ricans.  Oh my God.  And we'll talk to them next.  Stay there.  The Opium Anthony Show.  I have no clue what anybody's saying, but it's the funniest damn show.  More stupidity on the way.  1027.  1027. 
[36:30]
 W-A-W. It's The Opium Anthony Show.  I told you guys yesterday, no longer FM Talk.  But once again, The Opium Anthony Show is exactly the same.  We're the one constant in the universe, like the cockroach.  No matter how our surroundings or environment change, we remain.  We adapt.  We adapt.  We will be here for millions of years.  Either that or until we get a Bobby Bonilla deal, you know, buyout. 
[37:00]
 Yeah.  I don't think they'd do that for us.  So the upper management of CBS, if you guys want to give us a Bobby Bonilla buyout, Ant  and I will walk today.  What are we going to do for 11 years though?  Before it kicks in?  Yeah, that could be a little rough.  That's got to suck, especially like if you don't get another gig.  So you're just hanging out and you're like, hey, look, I'm going to be rich in like 10  years.  Believe me.  I swear.  Get back to the dishes.  You know, I would still go for that deal though. 
[37:30]
 Really?  Oh, without a doubt.  I don't know, man.  I would go back to Caddy.  I would honestly.  You look a little silly now, Caddy.  I got to say.  Why?  Come on.  Well, I could see, you know, working your way through college or something or for high  school, whatever you're doing, caddying.  But now it's like, hey, you could probably really use the punter, you know.  Hey, man, I was good.  I don't doubt you are.  You're a good caddy. 
[38:00]
 But would you feel comfortable with a bunch of kids caddying and you standing there?  Honestly, I could care less, Ant.  To this day, when I was a caddy, it was my best job.  It was your only job.  Yeah, that's true.  I've never had a real job.  I'm from radio.  I'm trying to think.  You're a caddy and a DJ.  Let me think.  Have I ever had a real job?  Hmm.  I was a caddy.  I don't think so.  I worked in a video store where we watched porn all day.  You worked in a video store too, huh?  Yep.  What did you do?  Did they like the counter? 
[38:30]
 You rang it up?  I told you that story.  I got fired because his sales went way down.  And I'll tell you why.  I was on the five-year plan at Geneseo.  Didn't want to go home.  Sure.  It was too much of a party up there.  So I started making up new majors and reasons why I had to stay.  And I finally needed some cash, so I got a job at this video store.  I was in a fraternity up there.  I was also on the radio, college radio, no big deal.  Sure.  I was also a bartender slash DJ in one of the big bars there. 
[39:00]
 A lot of people knew me in Geneseo.  Key to the story is the only reason I'm saying that.  So I get this job at the video store for some extra cash,  and all my old fraternity brothers are coming in,  all the bartenders I worked with at the bar,  just people I knew all over town.  And they would come in to rent videos and stuff,  and they just assumed that it was free because I knew...  They didn't charge you.  I didn't charge anyone.  They were like renting VCRs for a week at a time,  and other people would come in and they wanted to rent the VCR, 
[39:30]
 but the other people never brought them back that had them for free.  I'm going to take this.  Yeah, I just wrote it down and said,  bring it back in two, three days.  And then if that's not bad enough,  all my other friends that didn't feel like going home  would come into the video store during the day,  and we would watch the sickest, wildest porno in the video store.  And then like a mom would come in with her little daughter  and wanted to rent a Disney movie or something.  We all were bummed that we had to turn off the porno  so she could go try to pick out a video.  And then everyone caught on. 
[40:00]
 And I mean, the books were just horrible, horrendous.  You lost a few bucks.  Yeah, and I ended up getting fired.  You had the porn section in there and everything?  Behind the curtain?  This was the early days of the whole video.  So yeah, it was just a little section.  A little section over there because I...  You know, you want to go into the porn section,  but you just have to make the move.  There's got to be the right people near the curtain before you duck in. 
[40:30]
 Do you get some legitimate videos first  and then go into the porno section?  And then coming out, you don't know who's going to be standing there  when you bolt out with, you know, gay love.  Sluck sluts from Venus in your hand,  and then you walk past and it's like, oh, look at that, the pervert.  See, I know I'm getting older because I don't care anymore.  If I want a porno, I will go and get one. I don't care.  Dwayne Reid, last night, what do I say?  I see a guy, he's buying, and he's like an old guy. 
[41:00]
 He's buying...  He's got two video cassettes in his hand, blank ones, and rubbers.  And he's walking, and he's just like...  He's looking at the rubbers in front of everybody,  and he's just like this real old guy.  And he's got the video thing, so you're just thinking in your head,  oh, my God, who did he abduct?  They're tied up somewhere.  He's got the cameras, he just needed tapes and some rubbers, that's all.  And he's looking at them, and he's like, oh.  So then for a moment, I'm thinking in my head, all right, 
[41:30]
 maybe he just needed the videos, he's just a responsible older gentleman.  He puts the condoms and the video cassette on the counter,  and then starts asking the guy, how much is this? How much?  And he goes, well, the tapes are this and the condoms are this,  and he's digging in his pocket. He's got to pull change out to pay for it.  It's like, oh, yeah, there's some poor bitch tied up in his pad.  It is murder hack pad.  I don't even want to think about it. God.  Just unrolling those rubbers on that shrivel. 
[42:00]
 And everyone's looking at them like that.  Everyone online was just like, oh, the old guy with the condoms and the video tape.  That's just not something you want to say.  But there is. You don't want to buy those things like the video porno vids.  You go into the pharmacy, you got to buy the rubbers or something like that.  You just don't want to what? That's a deal with it.  That's as bad as the guy day before Halloween getting the apples and pins.  Apples, pins and razor blades. 
[42:30]
 And that's nothing else for me. Thank you. I've got plenty here.  You know? Yeah.  People look at you a little strange.  By the way, a shock coming in today. Coming in right now, actually.  Belichick is leaving the Jets.  Everyone's bailing out.  Everyone's bailing out.  Punch out Maverick. He's going to the Patriots. That's obvious.  Well, there's a lot of jobs that he was the number one man for. 
[43:00]
 I guess he's a little pissed off for the Jets that he didn't get a chance to interview.  But the Patriots.  That's not what you were saying in the office, Derek.  No, that is the guy's honest truth.  No, wait, I'll get into this ass.  There's a little bit of an argument going on in the office.  No, I'm not.  The fact is Belichick is pissed off probably at the organization that he didn't get a chance.  But I don't think he has any right.  Parcell set him up nicely here in New York. 
[43:30]
 Said, hey man, I'm going to be the coach in two, three years. I'm stepping down as yours.  They screwed him though by not giving him the opportunity to have a couple of teams to bargain between to get the cash.  But it's business.  You and I can't like, you know, walk around New York and tell the radio stations and, you know, and say, hey man, can you give us a better deal than WNEW?  There's a better analogy, I think, because it's Parcells and Belichick.  And I think and I agree with Rick that Parcells kind of screwed him over a little bit, even though we brought him with him to New York. 
[44:00]
 What you guys don't remember though.  Remember a couple of years ago?  A couple of years ago, Belichick was up for the Jets job and Parcells took it and basically pushed him out of the way.  Right.  Watch Parcells jump over to the Patriots before Belichick.  That would be funny.  That's like the double screw.  You know what I see happening at this moment in time though, because the Jets have too good of a team to just screw it up with the coaching right now? 
[44:30]
 I see Bill Parcells coming back now.  No, he's done.  Yeah, but he was stepping down because he knew he had his right hand man ready to move in, but now that he's gone.  Didn't you read the man in the glass in the Daily News, the poem he read to his people?  I don't know what the hell that means.  I don't know either.  I wouldn't be surprised if all of a sudden he goes, all right, until we can figure out this whole mess, I'll come back next year.  I would not be surprised.  I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised. 
[45:00]
 I don't know about that.  Who are they going to get?  Are we going to get Pete Carroll back?  God help us.  I don't know though.  He kind of made a he's done that before though, make it sound like he's not doing anything.  Right.  He usually leaves a little opening though.  Didn't he when he was leaving the Pats and coming to the Jets and he's everyone was like, no, he's saying he's not going to the Jets.  He left like some kind of little verbal opening there.  I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised if he comes back now because now the team is just screwed up. 
[45:30]
 We're only going to get in there.  I don't know.  We only have one good year left with Vinny.  I know that's kind of a joke.  I know last year was probably a fluke year for him.  I'm not going to be stupid, but yeah, really.  I mean, everyone looks at him as a like he's a hero.  I mean, the rest of his career pretty much blew.  I'd like to see Ray Lucas in there next year full time, but whatever.  It's going to be very interesting, Anthony, to say the least. 
[46:00]
 Maybe Scott Herman can go over there now that he's done with his responsibilities.  You know, we got to tell our faithful listeners, you guys all know Scott Herman, our old boss man that got I don't know what you call it.  He stepped down, I guess.  He's no longer, you know, in charge of 1027 WNEW.  Yeah, he's now only in charge of wins.  We've had him on the radio a million times, blah, blah, blah.  And he was in charge of wins before he got this job.  They kind of gave him this extra responsibility. 
[46:30]
 Right.  Which is like, OK, here you have wins.  Wins is like the, you know, the child you have that's in college, in law school or something.  It's like it's wins.  Very prestigious, always tops in the ratings.  Very responsible journalists up there.  It's wins.  And then they toss him the retarded two headed, polytomy baby that is NEW. 
[47:00]
 And he's got to deal with that.  Yeah.  So after a while, it was just like, oh, my God.  And you could see it on the poor guy's face.  He put in a solid two years.  He's not used to the problems that this place presented to him.  He's used to wins.  The college student, not the kid that the cops are dragging home on drugs every night.  Without going into details.  I mean, the crap he had to deal with because of you and I, mostly just you and I.  I mean, the rest of the station didn't really cause him too many problems. 
[47:30]
 It was you.  No one was listening.  Right.  It was you and I.  Yeah.  Well, the point I want to make, we saw him just before today's show.  Yeah, he came into the office.  Now, it's been two weeks since he moved on and said, you know, he's no longer going to be the boss of 1027WNW.  Yeah.  The guy looks 10 years younger.  Did you see him?  10 years younger.  People, I guess, at wins are asking him if he's on Prozac.  He's got a hop in his step.  He looks great.  He lost weight.  His hair looks darker. 
[48:00]
 Yeah.  I don't know what the hell happened.  He looks like a completely different person.  And the funny thing is he was coming down to our office because there's a transitional period going on here.  We got the new boss coming in.  Yeah.  Scott's kind of leaving.  So there's still stuff that Scott kind of has to pass on to us.  Right.  Yeah.  So Scott is like basically dumping about what?  Twenty to thirty pounds of paperwork on your lap this time.  Yeah.  The latest Opium Anthony problem that he has nothing to do with. 
[48:30]
 Lawsuit number 12.  I believe we're referring to it as.  Yeah.  Big stack of papers on the desk.  I'm like, oh, I'll just thumb through this.  And he's like, yeah, all the key words are highlighted.  So I'm just thumbing through it like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, he said that.  Oh.  The only thing worse than hearing a tape of you saying something stupid is reading it.  In a transcript.  Oh, yeah.  You thumb through it, you're like, oh, I never said.  Well, it's taken out of context. 
[49:00]
 You've got to realize there was a lilt in my voice when I said that.  A comedic lilt.  Lilt.  That's a great word.  Yeah.  So he dumps the latest problems on your lap and leaves the studio with just a skim, skipping  down the hallway.  Take it easy, guys.  See you later.  See you later.  You'll get a pirouette.  Yeah.  A pirouette.  A pirouette.  A tan down the hallway.  Just smiling. 
[49:30]
 Is he in the best mood of his life?  Yeah.  Because he doesn't have to deal with us anymore.  Oh, he says he loves us.  Like one of those earthquake victims that are alive after like two weeks and they pull the  rock off of him and he's like, oh, oh.  My God.  I'm sane.  Fresh air.  I'm sane.  I'll take a little while for these wounds to heal, but I'll be fine.  Full recovery.  That's it.  That's what this place will do to you.  I think if he had the choice, he would have chosen being one of those hostages in India 
[50:00]
 for a week in the puke plane.  In the puke plane.  Yeah.  Then deal with us for two years.  Better working condition.  Sure.  I'll take my chances with the homicidal hijackers.  In the puke plane.  Did you read that story?  Yeah, that's what I read.  About the one hijacker named Burger.  Burger.  And he was like a real nice guy.  He'd be all fun.  Wait.  And joking with the hostages.  Was he Indian? 
[50:30]
 I think so.  What a cruel joke that is.  My name is Burger.  But seriously, folks.  Try the meal.  We'll all be here all week.  So Burger, one of the hostages, right?  He was one of the hijackers.  Take my camera, please.  He was one of the hijackers.  And he was like the hostages were describing him as this really nice guy who would joke. 
[51:00]
 He was telling jokes.  Did you hear about the man in the helicopter?  Did you hear about the man in the helicopter?  This is one of his jokes.  The man in the helicopter who asked, turn the big fan off.  I'm getting cold.  Everyone knows that's a Polish joke.  But yeah, I guess he didn't want to offend anybody.  He's got a gun to people's eyes.  But then at one point.  He just wanted to offend anyone.  But I puked on my neighbor 10 times already.  Hey, thanks, sir. 
[51:30]
 Curry.  But they said, yeah, he would joke around like that.  And then the next second, if negotiations broke down, he'd say, well, I'm going to kill all of you.  And the people freaked out.  They didn't know what to think of this guy.  And at one point, they took a bunch of hostages up front and slit some guy's throat, killed him, and threw him off the plane.  So they meant business.  But then some of them were like, oh, he was the nicest guy.  He'd come by and pass out food.  He was like good cop, bad cop, all wrapped up in one. 
[52:00]
 Right.  The puke plane.  That must have been something when all of a sudden the engines just went.  And the fans stopped blowing.  I was I was reading all that coverage.  Yeah.  I mean, I've been on a runway for like two hours and I thought I was going to die.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I mean, you're just trapped in a plane and there's babies crying and there's a big, fat, sweaty guy sitting next to you.  You know, the deal.  Can you imagine being in a plane for six or seven days?  No fan hostage situation.  You weren't allowed to look up at all. 
[52:30]
 You had to look down for six or seven straight days.  And they weren't showing any movies or anything.  People are puking.  And then the body odor, they said, was just unbearable.  And that's why, you know, everyone was puking on top of that.  Can you imagine?  No.  Like you said, just when you're stuck on the runway for a little while, you know, and a little while being up to an hour.  And you're just so agitated and you just want off.  And it stinks.  Next time that happens, I'm going to think about this damn last situation. 
[53:00]
 You could be with Barga.  You know, I got to tell you, does it stink in here or what?  Come on, ladies, smile, wipe the puke off your face.  Did it stink like this before everyone started to puke?  I've been in some of your houses.  Oh, puke.  What's grosser than gross?  This plane.  What are you kidding? 
[53:30]
 You're all weak.  Barga.  When do you laugh at that?  Rick is just like throwing me these stupid lines.  Stupid lines.  No.  Get out of here.  We got to get to the pissed off Puerto Ricans out there.  Oh, God, they're still on the line.  They're still on hold. 
[54:00]
 This all started with a comment it made about black people ringing up bills on those stolen cell phones.  And then the then the angry black lady called and she made fun of Asians and then an Asian guy called and he made fun of Puerto Ricans.  So that's where we're at.  And we'll talk to a really pissed off Puerto Rican next.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Troll men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  This is Opie and Anthony. 
[54:30]
 It's 1027 WNEW.  We're back with the program.  Hey.  All right, you want to talk to a pissed off Puerto Rican, Anthony?  Sure.  This is getting way out of control.  Want to explain it one more time because people are tuning in for the first time today.  All right.  I guess a black woman heard a comment we made on the air about a black and white couple having kids.  I think somebody said yes.  Yes.  I believe you said it, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  I said the kids would be zebras. 
[55:00]
 Come on.  It's an old joke from the Jeffersons.  My God, I was on TV in the 70s.  Have we not come this far in the new millennium?  We can't say zebra.  But she found it offensive.  She took some offense to it, called up, voiced her complaint, and during the course of her complaint, goofed on the chinks.  I don't know how that got started, but she was a little hypocritical.  She found my little zebra thing offensive, but then she turned around in a breath and just said something about Asian people eating dogs. 
[55:30]
 Eating dogs.  Now, that's a stereotype that I don't think the Asians like or appreciate.  So we had an Asian guy call up, and he was pissed off at the black woman who called because she was pissed at us.  And lo and behold, the Asian guy had a problem with the Puerto Ricans.  It's a great, great state we live in.  I love this place.  We're so diverse that you can turn your head in any direction and hate somebody. 
[56:00]
 It's amazing.  So now there's Puerto Ricans on the line that are pissed off at the Asian guy who was pissed at the black woman.  Who, if you remember, was pissed at me.  Just reading the facts.  If you want to send a fax, that's worth reading on the air.  212-957-9639.  All right, so let's go to Jerry, who's the pissed off Puerto Rican, Anthony.  Jerry!  Hey, how's it going, fellas?  Hey, what's up?  All right.  I'm not upset.  It was, you know, fine.  It's just comments, man. 
[56:30]
 It's nothing big and personal.  That's right.  But that Asian guy, Steve, he's just pissed up because they don't have many or some kind of a relationship.  He doesn't have many or some sizes for condoms for his baby fried shrimp.  I guess he's implying that the Asians have small penises.  And maybe he's angry because he couldn't find a condom to fit over his small Asian penis, is what Jerry's trying to say.  And those hard things and with salsa, that's Dominicans. 
[57:00]
 Well, not Dominicans, Puerto Ricans.  Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, whatever.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  Do you think we can tell?  Do you think that we could tell?  As much as you walk down the road, you see an Irish guy or an Italian guy.  Well, you know the drunk is the Irish.  Although I'm trying to think of a better example.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, the Italian guy is always upset.  Well, OK.  You've got the attitude.  Oh, not to jump off the subject.  I was at Hooters.  I was Don't Want to Sign.  Oh, it's on, man. 
[57:30]
 Oh, and he's got a train in the People's Radio.  Yeah, we love when you guys bring signs to our live games.  No problem, man.  Appreciate it.  You guys are my fans.  We're your fans?  Well, I'm your fan.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Thanks, Jerry.  Well, we're your biggest fan.  I have a joke.  Yeah.  To say, how do you drown a Jew?  How do you drown a Jew?  Yes.  No.  You glue quarters in the bottom of the fountain.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  Jerry, I guess trying to say the Jew would stay down there, 
[58:00]
 trying to take the quarters off, even though they're running out of oxygen,  and probably just staying there and drown,  not being able to lift that glued coin off the bottom of the fountain.  I don't think anyone is that stupid that they would stay in the water that long  for a lousy quarter, Anthony.  Maybe the Polish, but not the Jews, no.  Caesar, what's up?  What's up, Owe Nye?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  First of all, I got something for the little goo-goo called.  We breathe like crazy because we're not hung like a yellow Tic-Tac, OK? 
[58:30]
 Second of all, OK?  Second of all, at least we're not like the stupid Indians, OK?  Who freaking are starving to death for God forbid they eat a goddamn cow, OK?  Eat the meat, you dumbasses, like the Indians do,  or drink the same milk that the little rats dance around in, OK?  All right, so I'm assuming, Caesar, that you're really pissed off at the Indians.  They're idiots.  I think they're more stupid than the damn Polak.  At least the Polaks eat the meat when they're hungry.  Geez.  Yeah, it's pretty funny when you say starving Indians.  Starving Indians, you see a damn cow in their fight car. 
[59:00]
 What the hell's up with that?  And this cow's just in the road in the rivers that they're bathing in and drinking in.  I don't know if they got dead people in the rivers that they're bathing in.  What the hell's up with that?  Because it's a reincarnation of like an old relative or something.  Purify the water, man.  Come on.  Gosh.  All right, thank you, Caesar.  OK, buddy.  Thank you.  Is that why they do that?  Happy New Year, OK?  All right.  Because they believe their cows are reincarnated spirits of their relatives.  Something like that.  Yeah, obviously.  Wow.  How did that religion get?  I mean, it's hard enough to believe that the Son of God was Jesus and all that stuff. 
[59:30]
 Without that, my relatives are cow?  Right.  And I'm starving and they walk around in front of me?  How ironic.  What a bit of irony that is.  It's got to be a joke, isn't it?  It's a joke.  Rachel.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  I'm not on a stolen cell phone, by the way.  Oh, you're not?  No.  Are you a Recon?  Yes, I am.  All right.  But I don't have any kids. 
[60:00]
 None of my friends do.  And I'm actually a 20-year-old virgin.  Wow, I find that very hard to believe.  A Puerto Rican virgin?  Yes, I'm a Puerto Rican virgin.  But I guess I'm holding out for Anthony.  How fat are you?  What?  I'm nothing.  No, I have a very nice body and I'm just holding out.  Yeah?  Yeah, so whatever that little chinky boy said is not true.  What are you waiting for?  I'm waiting for Anthony.  What?  And I'm holding out for Anthony.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  What?  Anthony.  Wow.  Really? 
[60:30]
 The limo driver that...  No, I've just been holding out.  I haven't found the right guy, I guess.  All right.  But I would just like to say that I absolutely hate guidos.  Not Anthony, though.  So you're Puerto Rican.  You hate the guidos.  Yes.  I hate Italians.  You hate the Italians.  Wow, look at that.  But she likes me.  All right, hold on.  We got an Italian on the line.  Julio.  That is just Julio.  Julio, Julio's the Puerto Rican.  Julio, Julio's the Puerto Rican.  Julio, Julio's the Puerto Rican.  Julio, Julio's the Puerto Rican.  We went through this already.  Oh, yeah.  I remember you.  Julio, what's up? 
[61:00]
 What's up, boys?  How you doing?  All right, you're on the phone.  I got a comment for this lady.  I don't understand what the problem is with guidos because if you're looking at it this  way, Italians got to be the best thing you could think.  You got Polish that are known as dumb.  You got Irish that are known as drunk.  You got Jewish that are known as Italian.  No, you're not.  Yes, you are.  No, because you walk down the street saying, how you doing?  Forget about it.  I'm fine.  How you doing?  How you doing?  The thing is, I think you like Italians.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do. 
[61:30]
 I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do. 
[62:00]
 I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  Hi.  Look, is thisGood to hear. 
[62:30]
 Questions?  I think Romeo and Julietare alltas much better.  We love theи  couple other tapir but itwere we will go I don't know how  If the guy treats you not too good.  You don't have to apologize to the Thai family.  The old school Thai family. 
[63:00]
 I'm not talking about the new school of Thai.  Whatever, when you get that brief, hand brief, whatever, you get a full Italian, they do  the right thing by the family.  That's the important thing.  People, instant feedback coming in about Rachel.  They want to know if the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny are there with you, the 20 year  old Puerto Rican virgin.  I am a virgin.  I'm not going to lie about it.  You like girls call your show fame like they're lesbian.  Oh my God, look out behind you, it's Bigfoot. 
[63:30]
 I just made it thick as ever, really cool to defend my nationality, but then you made  that comment about the guidos when I was on hold and I'm not going to lie to you.  I got a little offended.  Very good.  Well thank you, Julia.  No problem.  Don't forget, tune in to the newest season of The Sopranos.  Right.  Yeah, we should do that.  Alright Rachel.  Alright, bye.  That's like our Italian playbook when we watch that.  It's like our game plan.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Sopranos marathon on HBO. 
[64:00]
 This is turning into a free for all today.  It certainly is.  Jay, what's your problem?  My problem.  Jay is Irish.  Yes, I am Irish and I am very tired of everybody saying that the Irish are all drunks.  You have that Italian guy over there, all he does is drink his wine and he doesn't do  anything else.  My parents are full blown Irish and they drink from time to time, but we're not all drunks.  From time to time, one o'clock to two o'clock to three o'clock.  It's not like that. 
[64:30]
 Anywhere you go, they hear your last name and it's like, oh, you want a beer?  You know Jay, I've got to say, we have a friend Jay up in Boston, we do that to him every  time we see him and he's Irish.  He says he takes the beer every time.  Hell yeah.  And he's usually drunk.  I know one thing and that's Irish guys can kick almost anybody's ass.  Yeah, it's usually their own brothers though.  You guys are always beating the crap out of each other, but don't try to get in the middle  of two Irish brothers fighting because then they'll both turn on you and start beating 
[65:00]
 the crap out of you.  Right.  Well, no comment on that.  And it's usually in a bar, drinking.  Yeah, well, I have another thing to say.  The Irish curse, that is complete bull.  You're hung like a what?  Oh, you've got like a good two, three inches, right?  I'd say double that, triple that maybe.  Double, triple.  It's duct tapes in my leg.  All right, hold on.  There's another Irish guy on the line.  Tim?  Guys, what's up?  All right, you're on with Jay, another Irish guy.  What's up, Tim? 
[65:30]
 How you doing?  No, sorry.  Listen, I kind of agree with you, but I don't agree with you.  My family, my uncles, they all died.  They're all dead.  And the only reason they're dead is because they drank.  All right?  My father was a problematic drinker.  I can't talk.  He sounds drunk.  I got it from you, Anthony.  And, you know, stop denying it.  You know, it's in the family, it's in the blood, it's hereditary.  All right, well, all my brothers drink. 
[66:00]
 I drink on occasion.  I don't drink Texas, but it's there.  It's true, it's true.  It's there, but, you know, it's like anywhere you go.  It's like as soon as they find out you're Irish, it's like they either accuse you of  being drunk there or they think as soon as you leave, you're going to go get hammered.  When you're Italian, people are like, oh, you're the mob.  You're Italian, you're going to go window shop in the Irish garbage, you know, with  a clear bed.  You know, you're going to go tit for tat now.  You know that's a Puerto Rican word.  Or even like Anthony, I think you said it one time before, your Irish friend you hang  out with, you check a car for bombs.  Yeah. 
[66:30]
 You know, hey.  I make him go out and start the car.  There you go.  Look, you started.  Oh, you got me.  Would you rather be, you know, related to terrorists or drunks?  Unfortunately, I have them both in my family, so you can't do anything about it.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  He's an IRA, I guess.  IRA drunk.  Matt.  Oh, am I a man now?  You're a Jewish guy that's pissed off at the Puerto Ricans.  Why?  Yeah.  I mean, that's total bull.  Like I drop a penny.  I don't go, oh my God, I dropped a penny. 
[67:00]
 I better pick it up.  I mean, I drop a penny.  It's a freaking penny.  That's all.  But if it was a quarter, that's another story, right?  A quarter.  I mean, I'm 13.  I only get an allowance.  So a quarter, yeah.  A quarter is a bit more.  A penny, though, I say screw that.  And that's fiscal, I gotta say.  All right, very good.  Thank you.  All right, thanks.  Bye.  I guess if you threw the penny in the Volkswagen, he wouldn't jump in after it, like the old 
[67:30]
 joke goes.  Mike, what's going on?  Not much.  I mean, this and everybody.  I'm half Italian, half Irish.  I'm not drunk.  I'm not in the mafia, although half my family's drunk and half my family is in the mafia.  I got a problem with the Arabs at the gas stations.  I don't know if you got this problem in New York, but why do they always have to call  you boss man?  Well, that's just the new saying.  That's like the dude of this new millennium to call everyone boss man. 
[68:00]
 The dirty only people that do it.  And I'm a police officer, so I see them all the time.  And there's like five words they know, five, ten, fill up, boss man and Rob.  I kid you not.  Remember when the guy was asking me if I wanted a receipt?  Yeah.  You want a reset?  Reset.  You want a reset?  I'm like, what?  A rose? 
[68:30]
 Why?  Then they get pissed off at you because you don't understand that.  I'm like, excuse me, reset, reset.  Reset, reset, reset.  Like, what's he saying?  I want to wrestle?  No, I need gas.  When they just know the word yes, because I remember one time we had a gas station get  robbed and get there and haku was like, what happened?  Did you get robbed?  Yes.  Was it a black guy?  Yes.  Did you have a gun?  Yes. 
[69:00]
 It's like, all right.  And believe it or not, there were some Puerto Rican guys there and they started messing  with the guy.  And they're like, are you gay?  And he's just going on.  He's like, yes.  They just kept going and going.  It was so funny.  Do you take it up the poop chute?  Yes.  Boss man.  Have you ever been fisted?  Yes.  All right, Mike.  All right, you guys rock.  Thank you.  It's nice to start off the new millennium showing that we've moved forward. 
[69:30]
 Yeah, and we can really spread the love here between the races.  Michelle, what's going on?  All right.  I am 100% Italian.  The other half of my family is Puerto Rican.  My aunt married a Puerto Rican.  His great grandmother was from Spain, an actual Spaniard.  They hate Puerto Ricans.  Even though I hate Puerto Ricans.  Sounds like static or something.  Wait a minute.  Michelle.  Yes.  Is your mustache rubbing on the phone?  Because I'm hearing. 
[70:00]
 You know what?  I'm Sicilian, so it's not dark hair or anything.  Just saying, even the actual Spanish people do not like Puerto Ricans.  Yeah.  We all know that from the ovation Rick gets on any given day here that people don't like  Puerto Ricans.  And all signs are not, the psycho Rachel was still on the phone.  Yeah, well maybe she'll call, if she calls back, you call back in, all right?  Okay. 
[70:30]
 All right, Michelle.  Thank you.  I believe we have a free for all in progress here on the Open Anthony Show.  Unbelievable.  Look at the screen.  Argentinian pissed at Rican's, Polish and I'm pissed at Anthony.  Pissed Rican at Slanty Eyes.  Jesus, man.  In Italian, I hate Indians.  Will on line seven, he's German and tired of the Jews.  Jews pissed at the Arabs.  Oh geez, there's a new battle.  Can't we start a new battle? 
[71:00]
 Why doesn't anyone hate the goddamn Canadians?  All right, more of the flap heads, more of this crap on the way.  Stay there.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Do-do-do-do.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are gonna burn in hell.  OP and Anthony.  1027.  1027, W-A-W, it's OP and Anthony.  Off to a fine start today, January 4th, 2000.  19-2000. 
[71:30]
 A lot of people still convince we're on vacation.  I don't know what we have to do to convince you guys that we are here live, almost nationwide.  Yeah.  Another one of my power meetings during vacation.  Ah, in other places.  I was schmoozing with the people back in Boston, Anthony.  You are, you are.  Schmoozing, wheeling and dealing and getting hammered.  Really?  Getting hammered.  You got hammered up in Boston?  I got hammered throughout the whole vacation. 
[72:00]
 Where are you really?  My new love.  Red wine.  Nice.  Lots and lots of red wine.  I feel like I'm in town.  You gotta drink that kind of at room temperature though, right?  I was doing that.  Yeah?  Some nice bottles of red wine.  They still had to screw off tops but they looked nice.  Wow, no corks.  No pesky corks to deal with.  Nah, the corks are a hassle.  What the hell was I drinking this week?  But the label looks good so it must have been good wine.  Captain Morgan and Coke and beer.  Yeah? 
[72:30]
 And a couple of Bloody Marys.  Those are always good.  Well, I got another announcement to make.  Very exciting news for the Open Anthony show.  Well, first of all, our article is out in Raw Magazine.  Yes, on newsstands now.  We should give the WWF another fine plug for the great article they wrote on You and I.  Raw Magazine.  The January issue.  It's finally out.  It's got a Christian and Edge on the cover with the Hardy Boys.  Right.  We were talking about this about a month ago and everyone's like, look man, I've been looking  for the article.  It's not out.  Well, if it's going to be the January issue, I guess it would come out in January but we 
[73:00]
 weren't thinking like that.  Way back.  Well, back in late November when we started talking about this.  I've got magazines where it says, you know, the January issue when you could pick it up  in November.  Doesn't that freak you out?  Yeah.  Playboy does that.  Like I think they're up to like November 2000 right now.  They can't pump those out faster than us.  Right.  Because there's a demand.  But anyway, so that's very exciting news for us because that's nationwide.  Yeah.  So I was in three different states over vacay and every bookstore and magazine stand I was 
[73:30]
 at had it.  I was like, wow.  And I'm such a retard too because I was at like a bookstore and there's the Raw Magazine  with our big huge freaking mugs.  Yeah.  Can you take a bigger picture of us guys at WWF?  I know both pages.  So I open it up to that and I just lift it up with all store to city like they care.  Look, it's me.  Look, see that's me.  I'm in the magazine.  Can I have it for free?  Because see, that's me.  You can't even buy or have your own image given to you. 
[74:00]
 No, you must buy it.  No.  So we're excited about that.  I think it's the best article ever written on us.  decided to do an interview with us like to trash us.  They make believe when they're here, they ask all the fluffy questions and stuff like,  hey, and it looks like it went really well.  Like that's gonna be a good article.  Then it comes out.  It's just a piece of crap.  They don't understand us or our show or our listeners.  They're just shock jocks.  Right.  But not in Raw Magazine.  They're fine job. 
[74:30]
 And the wheeling and dealing in Boston, we are officially syndicated.  I get out of here.  But not the whole show.  It's kind of a weird thing we're doing.  Yeah, they are playing in Boston, our best bits.  Really?  Our best bits, which is kind of cool.  Like when you tune in the station in Boston, you're only going to hear the good stuff from  Opie and Anthony.  So like when we're having a crappy day here in New York, it doesn't matter up there because  they only got the best stuff.  True. 
[75:00]
 And Opie did the wheeling and dealing?  Wheeling and dealing for this?  A little bit.  You did too.  All right.  But I'm just going to get to the point here.  What do you say?  Wheeling and dealing?  I see it in your eye.  Go ahead.  Burn me.  How about the cash?  Oh, well, that's something I'm still working on.  There will be no financial reward.  As you know by now, we're not in this for the money. 
[75:30]
 Believe me, I know.  But if our agent would ever call us, I think we could work those details out.  Trust me, I don't want my income bracket going up by a buck.  Believe me.  Well, maybe that's why we're waiting for that.  Just let me know when it's okay to work out that deal for us.  That's okay.  Just ask Sandy if she wants another cruise.  I just realized I paid for that.  Did you?  I guess I did.  No, you don't have to pay me.  It was Sandy that went. 
[76:00]
 You want her to pay you back?  My wife took Sandy on a cruise.  My wife takes Opie's girlfriend on a cruise.  I paid the bill.  It hit me over the holidays.  I'm like laughing his balls off over there.  It hit me over the holidays.  Wait a minute.  Aren't you on the cruise?  Put on the American Express card, even if Sandy paid her back, I didn't see it.  I didn't see a dime back. 
[76:30]
 Well, I remember writing out the check for Sandy to give to her.  No, I know that didn't have any of that.  Are you sure?  So it's like, you know, sorry I didn't get you anything for Christmas, O.  But I got your check, a cruise down to the Caribbean.  Too bad that's not the only thing you've paid for recently.  Tell me about it.  If there was only a cruise, I think you'd be real happy right now.  I'll pay through the nose.  Anyway, so what was the point? 
[77:00]
 We're up in Boston now and they're playing our bits like all over the damn radio station  up there.  So yeah, very excited.  So if you want to send an email to WBCN in Boston, you know, thanking them for having  the balls to get us back on in Boston, that would be really cool.  The cool thing, though, is a lot of you guys, I mean, a lot of you guys have been big parts  of our our bits.  So now some of you guys are being heard in Boston as well.  It's not just Opie and Anthony.  No stuff we've done down here.  Some of the stuff I've said is some of the hilarious stuff you guys have come up with. 
[77:30]
 So and now it's up in Boston.  Right.  WBCN.  Right.  So the virus slowly spreading slowly, but surely.  And they were our arch enemy years ago.  Yeah.  It's strange to be on that station.  Honestly, it's a huge story up there.  Yeah.  Like they're they're sending down the articles every day.  It's just ugly.  Mm hmm.  Because it was the station we used to just completely bash and trash on the air when  we were up there.  Yeah.  Picture to put it in some perspective here. 
[78:00]
 Picture if we went over and started having tea and crumpets with Wilpen Darvish.  That will never happen.  It was just as bizarre having it happen up in Boston.  But after many meetings and many bottles of wine and dinners and schmoozing, we put our  differences aside.  Yes, we did.  And we didn't do it for the cash.  Because there is none.  Because there is none.  Because that's what they're saying up there too.  You know?  Yeah.  That we're doing it for the cash. 
[78:30]
 No, we're not.  We're just doing it because we have a bunch of faithful listeners up there too that we  want them to hear some of the stuff we're doing here in New York.  How come everything we do, people say we do it for the cash and we never see cash?  I don't.  I don't understand it.  It's like, oh, they've got to be doing it for the money, man.  They did this and that.  They got fired or they said this.  What money?  What money?  We're still waiting.  I wish I'd seen it.  I mean, Ant's wearing a brand new shirt, but that's the first new shirt I've seen you wear  in five years.  Christmas present. 
[79:00]
 What do you think?  I buy shirts?  Oh, very good.  We're kind of impressed.  We're all whispering behind your back a little bit going, wow, look at Ant's style with a  brand new shirt finally.  Jesus Christ.  You know something?  You said that about the nice new shirt I was wearing last week or something.  So how many you got now?  Two?  Yeah, up to two nice new shirts.  And you still have like the Jack Daniels t-shirts?  No, you know something?  I really don't.  No?  Nothing's that make the crossover. 
[79:30]
 I can only leave the house with so much in my trunk.  After you broke in.  Yeah, you know how to do it.  What?  What?  Huh?  No, just, you know, I got a couple of nice shirts, by the way.  I need my crowbar back.  Good luck.  I left it.  I couldn't carry my computers in my clothes and same arm.  I wouldn't make two trips. 
[80:00]
 I fully expect the cows to put a gun to my head.  So I don't know.  I don't know where this break started, but no better feeling than when you're breaking  into your own house.  Wow.  Get a little warm in here.  Get on the AC.  Getting a little warm in here.  It's really warm in New York today.  That's that spring like weather they're talking about. 
[80:30]
 But it's supposed to get a little cooler tonight.  So you're a little delirious is what you're trying to say.  That's it.  And people shouldn't pay attention to the last 15 minutes radio.  I was just trying to take the attention off something private like my new shirts.  Kind of deflect the attention elsewhere.  So you wouldn't dwell on my shirt.  I changed the subject real good, didn't I?  Wow.  OK, everything will come out.  Don't worry, people. 
[81:00]
 Everyone thinks they're being left out of the loop.  Well, we took a break from abusing all the races, but they're back on the phone lines.  I think we have to take another break.  I don't know what we accomplished during this one.  We don't have to accomplish crap.  That's true.  Stay there.  OP and Anthony.  This is the best radio you guys could come up with.  1027.  1027.  WNNW.  It's the OP and Anthony show.  Hey, man.  Hey. 
[81:30]
 If I had the Slum and Shield, I would have had none of myself.  Ouch.  Oh, well.  Pay no attention to this radio show today.  All right, where are we in this mess of a show?  A lot of pissed off people on the phone lines.  We have people full of hatred and racial stereotypes. 
[82:00]
 And what other place gives you this forum to let it out and feel better about?  You know, I think when some white trash hillbilly calls up and starts, you know, bad mouthing the chaggers on our very radio show,  I think he's ready to go out and be more peaceful in real life.  You really think, huh?  Oh, yeah.  What is a chigger, by the way?  You ever see a bug?  Yeah.  It's like a bug, like a chinch bug.  OK. 
[82:30]
 Or a chigger.  So a chigger is a bug.  Yeah, if he was working on a farm, you would know about chiggers.  God damn chiggers.  Little pests, the chigger.  And they get on the children, I hear.  Chiggers get on with children.  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  I remember a beautiful girl in our town, beautiful blonde haired girl,  walking down the street with a goddamn chigger on her arm. 
[83:00]
 Now, girl, what you do with that chigger?  Come on over here.  And I took joy in killing that chigger.  I told her, I never want to see you walking down Main Street of this town again  with a chigger on your arm.  So you got to stay out from where the chiggers are, or they get on you.  And chigger would be a bug, right?  It's a goddamn bug. 
[83:30]
 OK.  It's like a chinch bug.  Right.  Or a mite.  They live under the leaves.  It's called a chigger.  OK.  Very good.  A goddamn chigger.  But they feel better about themselves.  OK.  Yeah, they do.  Let's go back to the phones.  Chris has been waiting a long time.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  All right.  I'm Italian, and I can't stand those dirty, stinking sand niggers. 
[84:00]
 Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  Didn't ring the bell once during the chiggers.  Oh, well, chiggers are bugs.  A bug.  That's what I said.  Just say dothead or something, man.  How about raghead or something?  Oh.  That was a little harsh.  I deal with them all day.  Yeah.  Well, what's the problem?  Oh, they got these little kind delis.  I used to deal with nice and stuff.  And then you got these guys buying them out and destroying everything and being rude all 
[84:30]
 the time.  I just can't stand them.  All right.  You know what I'm saying?  Uh-huh.  You waited almost an hour for that, huh?  Okay.  I got to say that the sand bleeped on the air, so what the hell?  Okay.  Thank you.  I was hoping for the first train of the new century.  Well, I'm waiting for my template.  There it is.  Well, Kevin is going to admit that he's Irish and he's a drunk.  Kevin?  All right. 
[85:00]
 Yeah.  I thought a chigger was a black Chinese.  No.  Okay.  Well, no.  I'm Irish and when I first got to college, I was getting slammed off of two beers, but  that was only three months ago, and now I'm like nine and feeling good.  So you're an Irish guy that likes to drink.  Oh, yeah.  The stereotype is completely true.  All right.  Very good.  But, you know.  Well, thank you.  All right.  No problem.  All right.  Bye.  We're going to move on to other things very soon here.  Stacey, what's going on?  Hi. 
[85:30]
 Hi.  Okay.  Number one, that Chinese dude, he's so stupid, okay?  The reason he's upset at the Puerto Ricans because they look good.  You know what I'm saying?  They have good looks.  Stacey?  Yeah.  Loved you in white man can't jump.  Anyways.  God damn.  Listen to your voice.  Go ahead.  Continue.  You're pissed off at the Chinese.  Yeah, because number one, everyone that's bumping on the Puerto Ricans are upset.  All right?  But a simple fact, they know the Puerto Ricans have it going on.  And then you can see them confusing us with the Mexicans.  You know what I'm saying?  Does Woody Harrelson have a problem with that?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not saying that he's a good guy.  I'm just saying that he's a good guy.  I'm just saying that he's a good guy.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  But a simple fact, they know the Puerto Ricans have it going on. 
[86:00]
 And then you can see them confusing us with the Mexicans.  You know what I'm saying?  Does Woody Harrelson have a big unit?  For real.  For real.  Don't start me off.  You don't know me like that.  No?  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  The Puerto Rican winning all that money on Jeopardy.  Come on.  Who are you kidding?  Oh my God.  You're being bad, man.  What?  Go ahead, Stacey.  You're being bad.  You're being bad.  You're being bad.  You're being bad.  You're being bad.  You're being bad.  You're being bad.  You're being bad, man.  What?  Go ahead, Stacey.  I'm sorry.  Not because he's a jackass, but that's what that is.  Anyway. 
[86:30]
 All right.  Touche.  Very good.  Very good, Stacey.  All right.  Go ahead.  So you don't like the Chinese?  No.  He needs to shut up.  He has a stinky ass, all right?  All right.  And his, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  He needs to shut up.  For real.  Mr. Obvious is on Line 10.  Paul.  Hey, Stacey sounds like Rosie Perez.  Well, I don't look like her.  I look much better anyway.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah.  Yo, first of all, let me ask this person a question here.  Yeah.  She knows Puerto Ricans and everything like that. 
[87:00]
 I got a question.  How come all Puerto Ricans are not getting Honda Civics?  They're changing the exhaust system so it's not like we left this.  Oh, please.  We don't have Honda Civics.  Please.  You're the one with me.  Me, me, me, me, me.  No, you got all that, Rosie.  You're like, no, I'm in it there.  Now, check it out.  That's number one.  You know, Anthony over there, figured out all the stuff with the Sammy Sosa.  There's no more salt in the winter.  Sammy Sosa is freaking diminutive.  Sammy Sosa is freaking Dominican.  Get it straight.  He's Dominican.  He's not Puerto Rican.  He's Dominican.  He's not Hispanic, duh.  What are we talking about?  Hispanic or are we talking about Puerto Ricans here?  Hispanic to Puerto Ricans. 
[87:30]
 We're talking about Puerto Ricans, right?  Right now, I'm talking about Puerto Ricans too.  I was just saying what Anthony had said prior.  The listeners did the show and you just call up Yakuts.  No, I've been probably listening longer than you have, so shut the hell up.  Oh, my gosh.  I love it when our faithful listeners fight it out.  Who's been listening longer?  I'm not listening longer.  I'm listening longer.  I'm listening longer.  I'm listening longer.  I'm listening longer.  I'm listening longer.  I like how she sounds now.  She sounds like Rosie Perot.  I'll give you that, Dopey.  She sounds like a really hot girl.  You know what I mean?  I love this guy.  He hates me, but I love this guy.  Anyway, take me with you guys.  Just one thing to say to that lady.  That Rombobilla cool-o later.  Hey, wait.  Paul, what are you doing?  I'm just going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom. 
[88:00]
 I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom. 
[88:30]
 I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  She what?  She blue balled me.  Oh really?  I thought I was all excited and didn't follow through.  Yeah man, she had me all lubed up with some of that fresh churn butter that they got.  Then I hear like a triangle ringing in the distance and she goes running off for a barn  raisin, man.  What's up with that?  Barn raisin.  I gotta go, man.  Very good.  You guys are a rip today, man.  Yeah, you guys are on fire.  I don't know, we done with this.  I don't know, we done with this.  I don't know, we done with this.  I don't know, we done with this.  I don't know, we done with this.  I don't know, we done with this. 
[89:00]
 I don't know, we done with this.  I don't know, we done with this.  Yeah, maybe we should go on to other things.  Alright, we'll touch on it a little later.  I think we've had enough racial hatred for this show's quota today.  The gaze?  It's not like a racial thing.  The gaze?  We'll get into Ricky Martin in a little bit.  Literally?  Seems like everyone else has.  Wow.  With his new head of...  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[89:30]
 Yeah.  Flaming hot mugs.  Hair of shocking white.  Do you see the superstition?  Black cast and blue dolls.  A lot of steel, a premonition.  That girl's gonna make me fall.  Girl.  Girl.  Who you kidding?  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  I'm coming down.  She's into your sensation  and gets into your mind 
[90:00]
 She's got you in her picture  for every day and night  She makes you take your clothes off  and go dancing in the rain  She makes you lose your place tonight  She takes you back to your party  Let the water into your brain  I'm coming down  I'm coming down  Living la vida loca  What?  Hey Ricky, why you pulling  your pants down in front of spas? 
[90:30]
 I'm coming down  Living la vida loca  What?  Living la vida loca  What?  Living la vida loca  What?  Living la vida homo  Cuíste yourself  Cuíste yourself  Cuíste yourself  Can we see your stuff?  those plugs up up. 
[91:00]
 You guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  effectivement  and  let's think of our girls yeah  that 
[91:30]
 and  w  entire  You to the losers.  You two are losers.  It's gonna make you puke. 
[92:00]
 We see you, Scott.  Hi, Anthony. Hello. How are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  Yeah.  Hi.  Well, there's a little story about him in a picture in the paper.  Did you see that?  Ball.  There it is.  I got some problems with the story.  Do you?  Yeah, yeah. I was eating a ball.  I was eating a ball.  I was eating a ball.  I was eating a ball. 
[92:30]
 I was eating a ball.  I was eating a ball.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah. I was eating a ball.  Oh, red flag.  There's a few red flags here.  Now, before we start this, we have no idea whether or not Ricky Martin pounds nails.  I have no idea about his sexual persuasion, but we can speculate whatever we please.  We have no clue. He's like a robin and likes to pull worms out of the ground.  No idea.  No.  So let's say that right off the top here. 
[93:00]
 Sure, sure.  Well, it seems Ricky Martin spent New Year's Day in Miami Beach.  You know.  Okay, that's the first red flag.  Boo!  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, he's in Miami Beach.  And I'm going to count the red flags.  All right.  Miami Beach, near Zave 1.  Looking like Goldilocks. 
[93:30]
 Boo!  Okay.  He bleached his hair.  Bleached his hair.  It's white.  It's not bleached.  How many of your pals do you know, Ann?  It's the new bleach in the pump dispenser.  Okay.  How many of your pals bleached their hair?  Oh, my God.  Let's see. There was...  None.  All right, so that's two.  Yeah, he dyed his hair.  People are saying...  Oh, his representative, his little rep people. 
[94:00]
 He dyed his hair just before Christmas, just for fun.  He said, for a goof.  You know, geeging.  That's what I do for a goof.  You do that for fun.  For fun, why not?  You know, maybe, I don't know, pop in a PlayStation game, Ope.  Or bang a bra.  Bang a bra.  You know, some fun.  Maybe go out for a few drinks.  When I'm thinking fun, I'm thinking banging bras.  Sure.  Not dyeing my hair blonde. 
[94:30]
 Not going to the salon.  The little hair care place.  And having somebody bleach your hair.  Right.  Blonde. For fun.  For fun.  In Miami Beach.  All right, let's see.  He'd been on a two-week trip with two friends to India.  All right, well, we don't know who these two friends are.  Oh, they went to India?  That's what it said.  That's a surprise because they don't eat meat in India.  Well, those three didn't. 
[95:00]
 Oh.  Lucky he wasn't on that plane.  Okay.  So that's three red flags?  Three, yeah.  Okay.  Return to the United States.  You had to spend New Zealand, Miami.  And I think the jet ski was a Christmas present from someone.  So they'd been jet skiing.  They.  All right, this is...  A buddy.  Let's see.  And accompanied by a buddy and his pet Labrador, sunned themselves. 
[95:30]
 Hey, wait, wait, I got to stop you.  How long have I known you?  Oh, my God, years now.  How many times have we gone sunning together?  Geez, can I have a moment to count the amount of times we've spent sunning?  Sunning.  Do you call up your buddy and say, hey, Joe, you want to go sunning?  Want to do some sunning?  No.  No.  No, we have never sunned.  I think we got drunk together on a beach in Turks and Caicos, but there was no sunning. 
[96:00]
 There was no sunning.  Right, it was not.  Okay.  All right.  That's four red flags.  Sunning themselves before, and listen closely, the way this is phrased, before jumping on  a jet ski to tool around the bay.  Okay, listen.  That's five red flags.  Now, Ant, once again, I have to ask you.  We've known each other a long time.  You love jet skiing.  OPI owned my own Sea-Doo Watercraft, personal watercraft, the two-seat version, you know, 
[96:30]
 the one with the big seat where somebody can sit on the back if they damn well please.  Correct.  Yeah.  How many times have we gone jet skiing on the same jet ski together?  Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  Ever.  Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  First of all, what are you going to hold on to?  Like the whole gag when you get a girl on the back and there's a handle up front, you 
[97:00]
 know?  Hold on tight.  I'm going to jump some waves over here.  You better hold on.  Sure.  I'm going to try to blow your bikini top off when I go through this boat wake, you know?  Little tricks I just couldn't imagine playing on the Opster, hanging on the back of the jet  ski.  You know what I mean?  It just wasn't going to happen.  Sharing a jet ski.  A jet ski with his buddy. 
[97:30]
 And from the looks, I don't know, they could not have found a more gay picture of this  man to put in the daily news.  Noah's funny about that whole picture too.  Let me take a look.  They're having like some kind of little fight.  It's like a little moment or something because he seems a little miff.  Yeah, like Ricky with his cute little blonde hair.  I want to ride the jet ski next and you sit in the back.  He's pouting and his friend is kind of like behind him kind of like talking to him. 
[98:00]
 Trying to smooth things over.  And when I'm bummed about the radio show, will we ever find a picture of us like that in the paper?  I don't think that you could ever find a moment like that with us.  Never.  You're bummed about the show?  I'm like, well, I'll go down and get some beer.  The problem is solved.  We feel much better about things.  Sure.  No.  Let's get Ricky's all pouty.  I want to drive.  You're always driving. 
[98:30]
 Yeah.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo. 
[99:00]
 Woo.  Woo.  Yeah, Ricky.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo. 
[99:30]
 Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Now the abuse is coming.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening?  I'm thinking Sandy's loving you now because you must look exactly like Ricky Martin now. 
[100:00]
 Well, if you remember the time John Stewart came in, there was a whole controversy how  Sandy wanted you to get a Ricky Martin hairdo.  Right.  I guess he heard it.  Exactly.  You're not going to get his hairdo.  You're going to have to make her look more like Drew Barrymore.  Well, you can't tell what his hairstyle is like in this because it's been puffed back  from the jet ski.  From the jizz.  So actually, what are we saying about Opie now if he has that bleach blonde hair?  Just saying. 
[100:30]
 Just saying.  I hope he doesn't have bleach blonde hair.  And I didn't have a choice.  This is what I was born with.  When you start dyeing your hair bleach blonde, it's for fun.  Well, I saw you in the Raw magazine.  I figured with a little bleach, you could be a baloney smuggler like Ricky.  Oh, give me a break.  I don't share jet skis.  I'm just busted.  All right, Scott.  You guys are great.  Bye.  On the same page, too.  What the hell happened to Gwen Stefani? 
[101:00]
 What is she?  When you started seeing her braces when you were 12, not 30?  And she just doesn't look good in this picture with the braces.  How is she going to sing and look all hot and stuff with a mouthful of tin?  Gavin Rostel is just like, I'll remember.  Hey, Don.  Yeah.  You're a gay guy?  Yeah.  All right.  What's the problem?  I'm wondering why you guys are so homophobic.  What does it matter if Ricky Martin's gay or not?  I'll tell you why it matters. 
[101:30]
 Why isn't he singing songs about guys?  Yeah.  Then his career would be over.  Well, we can't talk about it, but him being silent is fine.  He's goopy.  I'm offended.  He's singing about banging chicks.  I'm offended.  I'm offended.  I'm offended.  He's singing about banging chicks.  Well, it's because he has to.  No.  I don't care that he's gay.  You're not ranking on him because he's gay.  I'm more ranking on him that he's, you know, and we don't know for sure, but I'm ranking 
[102:00]
 on the fact that he's singing about girls and it seems like he doesn't really know much  about women.  Yeah.  Okay.  I have a problem with that.  Yes.  Who's going to buy his records if they know he's singing to guys?  All you gay guys who will be so happy that he came out of the closet if he is gay.  I haven't even bought his record.  I don't like his music.  He's a nice looking guy.  You have to at least...  Honestly, if he is gay, I feel sorry for him, you know? 
[102:30]
 I mean, can you see Aunt Nye?  You know, we want to make it so bad that we're going to sing, you know, if it was popular  to sing about guys, all of a sudden we put a record out singing about guys because that's  the only way we can, you know, make it.  Screw that.  Well, I understand, but I mean, I like you guys.  I listen to you guys every day driving home.  Living la vida, oh, that's what the song should have been called.  Yeah.  You guys are equal opportunity offenders, but it just seems like you're ranking on the  poor guy.  He's in a tough situation. 
[103:00]
 He's probably got managers and PR people telling him he's out of town.  I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  He's got the, he's got the worst of both worlds is what he's got.  He's probably so happy.  You put the camera in front of this guy's face.  He flashes that big smile.  He's talking about how great everything is, how wonderful.  And you know, he's probably miserable because he can't get, he can't get the hot beef injection  in public because he's got to make it like, like he likes chicks and all those crazy Puerto  Rican girls jumping around, loving him. 
[103:30]
 Ricky, Ricky, come to me.  They all interview him.  They, when it comes to the garden and stuff, they get the cameras down there by the police  lines.  You want to say I love you?  And please if you would just come to me, I would be the best thing you ever had.  Ricky, please come to me.  Ricky, I love you.  I love you.  I will love you.  I will give you love like you never had.  Yeah, you would.  You don't have a penis.  Wouldn't we have it like he's never had?  But people like you make it hard.  You foster the hatred of others.  No, people like us don't make it hard, but this guy in the picture looks like he might 
[104:00]
 be.  All right, come on.  All right, enough.  Do you guys have any gay friends?  Honestly, let me think about that.  Gay friends?  I don't think so.  I had a homo friend.  We talked about that.  I wouldn't have a problem having a gay friend.  I have a problem with people being fake.  It's not being fake.  Yeah, it is.  It's having a hide.  You know, like, he did not go to Germany.  He had a hide.  You were a Jew.  Well, it's not worth it.  He wants to be that famous that he's going to hide and sing about women. 
[104:30]
 If you were gay, or one of you were gay, would you be out on the radio and be Gay Anthony  and St. Opie?  Yes.  Hi, it's the Gay Anthony Show with Opie.  Opie and Gay Anthony.  Well, you're on to us.  That's why we take so much time off.  We're too busy.  We can't get out of the bedroom.  No, I'm not saying that.  Yeah, I'd be out because I'd be banging guys all night.  You know you'd be biting a pillow.  I'd be pulling your hair, Don.  I don't think so.  You have my type. 
[105:00]
 You know, you're a type.  What's your type?  Anything with a schween.  See, you guys are crazy.  Oh, come on.  Oh, we talk about stereotypes and everything else, and then we get to a stereotype that  gay guys will screw anything, and you go crazy.  Well, straight guys will screw anything too.  Hallelujah.  Because it's guys.  But a straight guy has to find a good guy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy. 
[105:30]
 And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  And then you go crazy.  You uh, you uh, boned.  Saturday.  That's it, huh?  Pitcher, catcher.  Yeah, what do you do?  A little of both.  A little of both, huh? 
[106:00]
 It's the best of both worlds.  You shouldn't limit yourself to one or the other.  The best of both worlds, Uranus and Uranus.  Those are the only worlds involved there.  Come on, guys.  Why?  You don't think it's funny to str-  You know something?  You gay guys gotta figure this out.  Figure what out?  Just because we uh, think it's funny and stuff.  Just because we uh, think it's funny and stuff.  Just because we uh, think it's funny and stuff.  Just because we uh, think it's funny and stuff.  Just because we uh, think it's funny and stuff.  But you gotta admit, to a straight guy, gay sex is the funniest thing ever.  Just like, man ass.  Yeah, how do you look at man ass and go, wow, I want a piece of that.  I need some of that.  That's like-  How do you know that's gay?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  Hey why don't you I said, you're gorgeous girl and you're hot. 
[106:30]
 You're very hot too.  Why don't you I said you're gorgeous.  hairy thing is better than a woman's snatch?  It's what you are. I didn't ask to be this way, it's just that I am. 
[107:00]
 You didn't ask why? I didn't ask to be this way. It's what I  was. When did you know?  When I was 18. That's when I finally admitted it.  But you could look at it like... I really need to understand this, okay? You're at the  gym, let's say. You're in the shower and there's a guy next to you with the hairiest of asses.  You honestly get turned on by that? I don't like Wolfman like guys. There's all 
[107:30]
 different kinds of guys. He likes the hairless.  The girls. Not hairless. I think most guys have a hairy ass though,  right? Let me check.  Not that I don't. Jesus Christ. Get out of here!  Plus I've been with the same person for 8 1 2 years so I haven't seen one really.  8 1 2 years, huh? Yeah. How long have you been together with  your partner? Too long.  Wow, that's pretty good. You goof on everybody but it just seems like 
[108:00]
 then you get these calls from these idiots that listen to you, some of them that are  idiots and they just want to take what you say and then use that as an excuse to hate  gay people and bash them. You're mistaken. Humor and fun for hatred.  If you're a faithful listener to the show, you don't hear the hate in our voices.  Don't hate gay people. Think it's some funny ass crap though.  Think it's some funny stuff though. And it's real. 
[108:30]
 We're very real on this radio show. We're not going to fake it.  I know you're real. I'm saying some of your listeners interpret  what you're saying and use that as an excuse to hate.  Well, we can't wait. Opi and Anthony are making fun of them.  They're going to have to be alright. Let's go beat up a few fags.  I have an announcement. Opi and Anthony love gay people.  We're coming out. We're gay. Gay and loving it, Don.  You guys are funny. I like you guys. I listen to you every day, but...  We're here. We're queer. We're fabulous. Get used to us.  We're here. We're queer. We're fabulous. Get used to us. 
[109:00]
 We're here. We're queer. We're fabulous. Get used to us.  We're here. We're queer. We're fabulous. Get used to us.  We welcome both of you to the gay community. Thank you with open legs.  We welcome you. Thank you, Don.  Alright, guys. Here's the traditional gay greeting.  Hey, Don. Yeah, hello.  It wouldn't be our show if we didn't put you on the phone with a rotisserie. 
[109:30]
 No, no, no. If we didn't put you on the phone with another guy, okay?  I already have somebody. No, no. This guy wants to talk to you.  It wouldn't be our show if we didn't allow this to happen.  Yes. So I apologize before I put Carl on with you.  Alright. Carl? Hello, Carl. Yeah, this is me.  You have a question for the Colin Cowboy?  Yeah, why are you so proud of sphincter boy?  You have sex with some guy? Don't. Why are you so proud of him? 
[110:00]
 Alright. I'm sure we won't even hear a piece of that one.  Alright. First of all, I'm sure they dumped out of that.  Don? Don? Yeah?  I apologize for Carl. I thought he was going to have a little more fun than that.  Yeah, he was very intelligent. Yeah, I'm sorry.  You are. You like what you like. You can't help it.  Ricky Martin's in a tough situation a lot.  Probably Hollywood and music stars are in a tough situation  because their careers would be dead if he came out. 
[110:30]
 I don't know. I guess it's getting pretty trendy to be gay, though.  For whom? Someone like Boy George. Nobody was surprised when he came out as being gay.  You know, the gay guys would come rolling in if he would swivel his hips and say he was gay.  You wouldn't be there?  Who? You.  Ricky? With Ricky? Yeah.  Support him as gay as...  I'd support him, but I don't buy his records because I don't like his music anyway.  I'm not going to just like him because he's gay. 
[111:00]
 Tommy from Staten Island says gay guys don't have hairy asses  because the friction of the other fat stomach rubbing on it makes it disappear.  Is that true, Don?  That could be true.  Some guys shave their asses.  Go shave your ass.  All right. Well, thank you, Don.  Bye, guys.  Thank you for having a sense of humor.  All right. You guys suck.  All right. No, you suck.  Thank you very much.  Thank you for the setup. I needed one today. All right. 
[111:30]
 Whoa. Oh, man.  Well, he's... Hey, where's the J. Moore sex call?  He made a point.  If it's real easy, we'll go on a break with it.  Right there? All right. We have to play this again.  I know we've played it a million times, but our buddy J. Moore having gay phone sex,  and we'll be back with more of the Opie and Anthony show in just a bit.  All right. It's FM Talk at 1027. Talk, you can't ignore.  It's Opie and Anthony, and in the studio with us today, J. Moore.  Hey, Marco. 
[112:00]
 Yeah.  You're a gay guy?  You're in love with J?  Oh, I love J so much.  Get down here right now.  I would watch your show action.  Mouth was a mouth, my friend.  I would watch your show action and pleasure myself two and three times.  I think that is fantastic. I'm all for self-gratification.  You are so gorgeous.  Thank you, sir. Hey, Marco, these guys are blushing.  I love you so much.  I'm getting aroused talking to you, Marco.  I saw you on the cover of genre.  That's right. That's a gay magazine cover. 
[112:30]
 You are so beautiful.  Do me a favor, Marco.  I'm going to do phone sex for you right now.  Come on.  Take it out, Marco.  I'm at work right now.  I don't care if you're at work. Do you want it or not?  Oh, baby, I want it so bad.  Marco, do you know how ripped my stomach is right now?  Oh, baby.  So hot.  Marco.  This is a wet dream, baby, for me. Oh, man.  Where do you work, Marco?  On Long Island.  All right. You got to figure out a way to start.  Do you work at a desk? 
[113:00]
 No, I work in a factory.  In a factory? Well, you got to find, you got to get that phone someplace where you can touch it, man.  Well, I'm behind a desk right now.  Take out the hog, Marco.  Because what I'm going to do to you is going to rock your way across.  Oh, baby.  Marco, my stomach is so ripped.  Oh, baby, I love that.  You know the hip bones when you get those diagonal lines that go down towards the crotch?  I got that too, man.  And your lower abs are really, really cut.  Yeah.  And I got, here's the top of all topers. 
[113:30]
 Two days ago, I shaved my tubes.  I'm not joking, Marco. These guys are laughing.  I do that too.  I do it just so I don't pull my hair when I masturbate.  It's not, seven and a half inches, Marco.  Oh, baby.  I knew it. I knew you were that big.  I'm circumcised. I got a pink fireman's cap on top of me.  Oh, yeah.  I have very small testicles. Not very small like a freak, but they're not like dumb a**holes, you know?  Oh, baby.  And Marco, man, I tell you what. 
[114:00]
 Then tell me about that hole of love.  No, I don't do it.  Oh, now you're drawing a line, Jay?  I can only do oral with Marco. That's all I can tell him.  Oh, baby, just let me put my a** in there and you will.  No, you can do that. Definitely. I'll let you do that.  I'll get a baby wipe. I'll get it ready. Unless you want to clean it yourself.  Oh, baby.  It's going to make you puke.  No, it won't. Marco, it is clean. I got baby wipes. I use toilet paper and baby wipes every time. 
[114:30]
 Oh, man.  Because you never know when you're in the Hershey Highway when this a**hole might break down.  And Marco, when it's all done, I'm going to make a map of Hawaii on your stomach.  Yeah.  It's going to be everywhere.  That's what I meant.  I can spray, like, I can break up an Al Sharpton March with what I'm spraying.  Oh, man. When I a**hole, I'll hit you on the forehead.  Come on, Marco. Is it out, Marco? Are you talking to yourself right now? 
[115:00]
 Uh-huh.  Come on, stroke it, man.  All right, all right.  Hold on.  You want me or not? Stroke it, Marco. Stroke it.  Show me. Show me. Show me.  Come on, baby.  Show me.  Come on.  You want to be gay? Let's be gay.  You say you're such a fag and all? Come on. This is your shot, man.  You are going to get it.  You are so hot.  You are so bad.  You're bad. You're going to get it.  And if you don't take that out right now...  Oh, you know I want to get it. 
[115:30]
 Do it.  You better finish. You better finish.  I'll get it.  I'm pulling my pants up if you don't finish.  I got mine out right now.  Anthony, just turn the other way.  Oh, man.  Do it, Marco. If you don't...  I'm going to smack your ass.  Smack that tight ass you got.  Come on, do it.  Do it all over me, Marco.  Come on. Come on.  Good. Good. 
[116:00]
 Oh, my God.  All right. Oh, my God.  Hold it. Hold it.  We're going in.  Oh, my God.  Come back soon, Marco.  Oh, my God.  I never dumped out so much in my life on a radio show.  Bring in the Lakers.  Opie, you're kind of cute, too.  All right. Bye, Marco.  Whore.  Whore. 
[116:30]
 You whore.  All right. We had to hang up on Marco.  He better have been doing it.  If I find out he's faking it, I'm going to the factory with all my gay friends and we're going to kill him.  The music was the best part.  I actually got an erection just from the music.  Opie and Anthony, 102.7 Talk Radio.  Forget it. Why listen to music?  You own the album.  What are you going to listen to?  Rock and roll.  You own that record.  Put it on 102.7.  It's a riot, baby.  It's a riot. 
[117:00]
 Opie, Anthony, 102.7.  This is a song that I wrote actually a couple of days ago after, excuse me, a friend of mine, my best friend.  We went out to a bar and we got really hammered.  We just had a really good time.  And I realized, you know, why not write a song about the good times that you have with your pal when you're out drinking at night?  You know what I mean?  Sure.  I wrote this for my best friend.  My friend.  That should be cute.  I'm going to play that now.  I hope he's listening.  If you are, man, this one's for you. 
[117:30]
 Here we are, dear old friend.  You and I, drunk again.  Laughs have been had, tears have been shed.  Maybe the whiskey's gone to my head. 
[118:00]
 But if I were gay, I would give you my heart.  And if I were gay, you'd be my work of art.  And if I were gay, we would swim in romance.  But I'm not gay.  So get your hand out of my pants.  It's not that I don't care.  I do. 
[118:30]
 I just don't see myself in you.  Another time, another scene.  I'd be right behind you.  If you know what I mean, cause if I were gay, I would give you my soul.  And if I were gay, I would give you my whole being.  And if I were gay, we would tear down the walls.  But I'm not gay.  So won't you stop cupping my hand. 
[119:00]
 It's radio.  We've never hugged, we've never kissed.  I've never been intimate with your fist.  But you have opened brand new doors.  Get over here and drop your drugs.  Let's go, any one. 
[119:30]
 Go.  Super bare.  Going all over the place.  A little feam.  A lot of corn music.  You know I realized that too.  Yeah, so you get some issues.  Yeah, a few there. 
[120:00]
 Deal with those I guess.  You're in your manhood.  That's fine.  And I am.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths we'll piss someone off.  Moki and Anthony.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  Alright, knock it off.  1027.  Hey Anthony.  Yes.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Stacker back with the Opie and Anthony show.  People lost weight with Stacker last year, you remember.  Now the holidays, people have been eating, gaining weight. 
[120:30]
 Now you've got to lose it.  Can I backtrack a little bit?  Okay.  I thought we hurt Stacker 2's feelings because they were advertising forever on our show  and then they went away for a little while.  I thought they had a problem with us, but I'm proud to say they are back and they had  no problems with us whatsoever.  I think the people at Stacker know that people are going to eat during the holidays.  So they should lay low, wait until they all fatten up and then give them a great opportunity  to lose the weight.  Let me tell you this.  Screw Jenny Craig. 
[121:00]
 If Monica Lewinsky was on Stacker 2, it should be a lot thinner.  Yeah, everyone's making a big deal of Monica Lewinsky.  Oh my God, she's still a heifer.  She's still a heifer.  Oh yes, she lost some weight.  Big whoop.  Give her some Stacker 2 though.  You're talking supermodel.  There you go.  So Stacker 2 does three things, right Anthony?  Yes it does.  It gives you a boost to energy so you're not sluggish.  A boost?  Yes, during the day.  It's the world's strongest fat burner. 
[121:30]
 So it burns the fat and it cuts the cravings to snack during the day.  There you go.  Adds up to losing weight.  Very good.  World's strongest fat burner at www.stacker2.com or you can give them a call for more info.  1-800-Lightline.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  1027 WNAW.  We're back.  It's Zofia and Anthony.  Old Dirty dropped in.  Old Dirty, yo what up? 
[122:00]
 Oh Dave was just looking at Luba's pictures up on the unofficial website.  And he's like, F'ing that bitch is fine.  Hell yeah.  Luba who acted like a prude when she was on our show, we couldn't even get a nip out of  her.  And she played lesbian for a day.  We were all just drooling over.  Turns out that she posed naked about a year ago and it's all over the internet.  These pictures are all set and ready to go for like Penthouse or Playboy right? 
[122:30]
 All professional stuff.  What the hell happened?  I just hit myself in the head with the mic.  I'm noticing one thing on Luba.  You're confessing?  Well no, she shaved down pretty good right?  Yeah.  Lot of stubble right there.  Look at that.  It goes up.  I think she's pretty hairy if she wasn't shaved.  If she wasn't shaved it would look like she has one of those big huge Russian hats in  her hands.  Those big furry Russian hats in her lap yeah.  That's what it would look like. 
[123:00]
 A babushka?  A babushka.  A babushka.  My babushka.  Look at the babushka in your lap.  Looks like a Rocky and Bullwinkle all in one.  Remember her man though?  Her pimp?  I mean her man.  Now a pimp.  What is Batonov?  He looked like the guy from the Georgie ads, the Georgie vodka.  Oh really?  Yeah.  I didn't check him out at all.  I was too busy checking out Luba.  Luba.  Well we found the naked pictures of her.  I don't even think she's happy that we found them. 
[123:30]
 This website is getting pounded to the point where they want to talk to us.  The website there very very happy.  I bet.  Also let's not forget there's also pictures on the unofficial website of Anthony and his  fur coat.  Anthony had a fur coat back in the days.  Yeah we talked about it in the air and during the holidays he ran into his uncle who happened  to have some pictures of it and now they're on the unofficial website for the whole world  to see.  You know how it is old dirty.  Your mom buys you clothes and stuff. 
[124:00]
 You gotta wear it.  And you gotta.  You gotta wear it.  And I had, you're gonna see it here.  Here I am.  Back in the day with my little fur coat.  You had a genuine fur coat on.  You're enjoying that a little too much.  That's my sister.  That's me.  That's my brother.  You can't even tell who Anthony, which one is Anthony. 
[124:30]
 You all had that long leaf carrot hair right.  Yeah.  It's got the leaf carrot hair.  You're right.  There's the full length shot of the fur coat.  Look at them all pimped out yo.  You were a pimp.  I'll make you get your ass kicked in school though when you wore that coat.  Yeah you can't wear that in school man.  Did you actually go to school with that fur coat on?  Do you remember?  Yeah I had to.  I was trying to sell the line that my mom was selling me.  Oh look, oh this one's wearing it.  Oh it's great.  No wonder Boomer beat you up. 
[125:00]
 Yeah.  I think that was about the same age.  Yeah that was around the time.  I think it was because of my fur jacket.  My fur coat.  It's pretty sporty.  I'd wear that now.  Boomer, Asaius and beat up Anthony.  Now I know why.  Oh yeah?  You never heard that story?  Back in elementary school.  Yo you could still sue them right?  Yeah right.  I went to elementary school out on Long Island East Islet.  You never were a point?  I went there for like a year.  Long enough for Boomer to beat me up.  Oh Daryl this is a great story. 
[125:30]
 He hated being called Norman back then because his name is Norman Asaius.  The gym teacher called him Boomer.  Even back then he was like the gym teacher's pet.  I mean everyone knew he was going somewhere you know.  But he was the most obnoxious bastard on the face of the earth.  He'd go around and fart in everyone's face like you'd be eating at the cafeteria.  And he'd come up and go, hey, like he'd be standing next to you and turn his ass around.  And then he'd go, hey!  And you'd turn your face and the second you turned it he'd go, you know right in your face. 
[126:00]
 Or like a choc right?  Yeah what could you do though?  Or he'd come up and just smack you on top of the head.  Wham, your fur coat wearing fag.  You know something like that.  And you were.  So he hated being called Norman.  So I waited.  So I was like turning the corner in one of the hallways.  And I went, hey Norman!  He's like, ah ha, you know goof on him a little bit.  And I turned around and one of his buddies was standing there looking at me. 
[126:30]
 Like, oh no man.  And the guy's like smiling and nodding his head just looking at me like yeah.  I hated that in school.  And it's like, oh don't tell Boomer that it was me.  That was after school.  It's like I want to see you man outside.  You're going to be a hot guy right?  And I'm going to beat your ass and kick your ass.  So I kept my coat on.  I'm not sure if it was the fur coat or not.  Because I wanted it as padding.  I wanted to be like a caveman in my fur coat. 
[127:00]
 So you know square off, get ready to do some brawling, little kids around.  Punch him square in the forehead.  He was big like that?  Yeah so I'm like trying to get the first punch in.  Wham, jump up, punch him in the forehead.  Square in the forehead.  The doctor later told me I broke the ulna and radius.  The two bones in your forearm just from hitting him in the head.  So there I am now.  I have the handicap of being a little pipsqueak.  I mean look at me in this picture. 
[127:30]
 I look like a little cake.  Oh what did I saw in there?  And there's Boomer, the big jack guy.  And oh let's give Anthony a broken arm too to finish out the fight with.  And there went Anthony's athletic career.  Oh that was it.  I was ready for a big career on the pros before Boomer broke my arm.  So yeah just kind of...  Actually you can like you know work the bong anymore.  I wasn't smoking back then.  Come on.  What happened to your fur coat though?  I don't know.  You think your brawling still has the fur coat?  Hell no.  We can have one of those ONA auctions. 
[128:00]
 Oh that would be...  You know what I would put on?  E-Pay.  The famous fur coat.  That thing is long gone.  Do you know what we should do?  Probably Ziggy's probably wearing it.  Know what we should do though?  Put the unofficial website.  We should have an ONA auction and come up with all the crap that is associated with  this radio show and have people bid for it.  Bid for our garbage.  Yeah like the fur coat, the fake vag.  That would be cool.  The videotape of the 100 year old lady having sex that we talk about a lot.  Right?  We can come up with... 
[128:30]
 We need that.  Rick's right.  We can come up with a ton of stuff.  We got plenty.  What happened to the couch?  It's still there.  The lesbian couch is out there ready to go.  Stained and smelly.  We're hoping to get some lesbians in here soon to be lesbians for a day.  Alright so our phone number is 212-757-1027.  We are here, we are live.  A lot of people think we're still on vacation.  It's amazing.  I don't know how long a vacation we take.  We're not up to the Howard three week vacations yet people.  Believe me. 
[129:00]
 No we get that for a whole year.  We just...  Damn.  I think we blew out our vacation the next year already.  Damn.  When do we have vacation next?  Don't we get a couple more weeks right after the first of the year like this?  Yeah we're going to try.  Ready?  I'm exhausted.  What are you saying?  What are you saying man?  Wasn't the limo guy here?  Anthony was here.  He dropped off some champagne for the new year.  We're going to be chugging that after the show I guess.  His kooky laugh.  You can hear it in the background right? 
[129:30]
 Freaking guy thinks everything we do is funny.  It's like dude trust me.  We even know what we just said wasn't funny so relax.  It's like a laugh track.  He laughs at everything we do.  It's like enough man.  Andrew what's up?  Hey listen I got $50 for the picture of Opie with the pumpkin wagon.  God damn you know I was listening to that on Best Of.  There is still a picture somewhere of Opie not only with the wagon but with his head  poking through a big pumpkin cut out.  Oh man.  With Opie's face poking through. 
[130:00]
 Dude you know something I fessed up.  I came through with my picture of me wearing the fur coat.  You've got to put that up on the website.  Listen call his mom.  My mom?  His mom's got to have a picture of it somewhere.  I'm sure Sandy sent it to him.  My mom's got some pretty wacky pictures of me.  I guess I could like.  Yeah you've got to take the hit.  I guess I could take one for the team.  And listen really quickly.  Yeah?  When you were playing that whole Ricky thing.  Yeah.  You should have played.  Is that a train idea? 
[130:30]
 Why?  Because he sucks.  It was funny.  He is a terrible man.  Alright man thank you.  You're killing me.  Thank you.  What happened?  I said yeah I got it.  That's what I said.  You got your chocolate penis over there?  See when I went in I went back to the office when we were playing music.  Right.  We were playing spots and I grabbed some of the chocolate that we got.  Who sent us that chocolate?  Sinful chocolates.  Right. 
[131:00]
 Okay.  And I make sure I go through the basket.  And there was plenty of chocolate in the basket.  Yes.  But I couldn't grab it because it was chocolate penises.  So I found the chocolate boob as you see and I'm nibbling on it here.  Yes you are.  Remember last year when they sent it?  Big basket full of huge chocolate penises.  We come walking in.  Rick is just mowing down on his chocolate penis and not even thinking anything about it. 
[131:30]
 He's talking, we're talking and just looking like it's no big deal to him.  What are you crazy?  Rick you're eating a big chocolate penis like it's chocolate.  You have it shaped like a penis.  You have it like a big vein and stuff.  You know what?  I don't think Rick should be in charge of worst of anymore.  No.  What happened to the whole chocolate penis bit?  Yeah.  Now that would be a funny worst of.  That's something people need to hear.  Look it's on my list.  It's one of the many bits I'm trying to find.  Ah that is. 
[132:00]
 It got lost in the fire that we never heard about.  The abuse he got that day was unbelievable.  Oh my God.  Because he didn't even think twice about it.  All of a sudden we both look at him and he's like he's got this huge chocolate penis.  It was a huge chocolate penis.  It was a huge chocolate penis.  It was not.  It was a small part of it.  Rick, trust me I'm Irish.  It was huge.  You know I remember because it had all the contours and veins. 
[132:30]
 I swear.  And he's just eating away on it.  Like Rick there were chocolate boobs in there because you were like I just wanted chocolate.  But there are chocolate boobs in there.  No there weren't.  Go get the chocolate stuff for old Dirty to check out.  Because the chocolate vag is pretty funny too.  Look I just bit off the nip.  I see that.  You like chocolate huh?  All right Rick is going to go get the chocolate goods. 
[133:00]
 Wow.  All right so Monica is a whore.  I see on the board there.  Thanks to talk about it at 1037WNAW it says Monica is a whore.  That's all that's up on the board.  It's Monica though.  Monica Lewinsky was on Larry King last night.  Enough already go away go away go away.  She's like I just want a private life.  I wish I could have a private life.  Then stay off the TV for a week.  She was humming Larry King live or something. 
[133:30]
 You know damn well she keeps saying that on every interview.  I want my privacy.  I just want to be left alone.  When I go out to a museum people are taking pictures of me.  It's like what does that happen?  Stay off TV.  Stay off TV for a little while.  Stop the interviews.  You'll fade away.  You think camera people are chasing Donna Rice around?  She's a cashie.  She got on her knees for the President of the United States.  Now she's trying to cash in.  Before you know it she'll be has been whore.  You know what I'm saying? 
[134:00]
 Well you won't have to worry about it.  Well she was on CNN last night off of Penises with Rick.  She was on CNN because of the whole Jenny Craig thing.  I guess she's lost what 35 pounds thus far?  That's it though?  I think so.  All right look it seems like a big accomplishment.  That's it.  If you're in the limelight and you're supposed to be losing weight that's more than just  the ordinary diet that somebody has to lose weight on.  She should be dropping like 60 pounds, 70 pounds in that amount of time.  The next time she goes on TV to do one of these interviews associated with Jenny Craig 
[134:30]
 stand up and show the world your ass.  I want to see if the ass is okay.  She's got a big butt.  That's the thing.  But she's lost some weight.  Let's see if she has an ass that looks like an ass finally.  You know what that probably looks like?  Even if she slid down to the point where she was like slender and guys were looking at  it you know she'd take her clothes off and look like a bat.  Big like flying squirrel things under the arms you know?  You got a spread eagle on the belly. 
[135:00]
 That crap ain't rubber.  That don't snap right back.  I guess she would have to vacuum all the cellulite out.  Yeah then she needs that.  She needs a nip and tuck.  I kind of like it with the big fat ass.  And she's saying that she's looking for Mr. Right Anthony.  Mr. Right.  Congratulations.  I hope she finds him.  She shouldn't have any problem because we all know she's sucking.  Well yeah.  She's not a sucker right?  Well I guess she can.  So just go on the line and ask him.  Hey Rick. 
[135:30]
 Alright we got the chocolate.  Look at this.  Some chocolate Tay Tay.  You don't like it?  You can't live without it.  All dirty.  Put down the chocolate.  I don't want to eat the chocolate.  Here it is.  Alright.  And here goes the chocolate vag.  Oh yeah make him do it Darryl.  That's it.  But that's what Rick was eating.  This is real straight.  No this one.  Look at the cubes.  Look at this one.  Wait they revert.  No no no we can't have a cube.  Hold on.  We're not.  No no no no. 
[136:00]
 Do not put a stupid cube on our microphones.  We can't have it.  We can't see each other.  It interrupts with the show.  They're on the rest of them.  They have brought in the brand new mic flags that now say 1027WNW.  Those aren't look like the mic flags.  Those aren't mic flags.  You know what those are?  The old mic flags with like bumper stickers wrapped around them right?  Those look like bird condominiums this old baby.  Do not put one on this mic or that mic.  I'm serious.  Because we can't see each other.  Yeah.  Oh Pete.  Yeah Pete we can't see each other.  Look look.  Hey oh what's up man. 
[136:30]
 How you doing?  I'm looking at a big tent.  Look at now.  Look at from this way it's like what are we it wins.  It's like a big tent.  There's a 27.  That looks like a pot leaf.  This hasn't been yeah this hasn't been thought through.  I know everyone's a little overzealous to just calling this place WNEW once again instead  of the FM talk thing.  But get new mic flag because you know what's going to happen?  Mike Adams is going to be like in a fit of rage in a nut induced fit like usual and just 
[137:00]
 start peeling.  Just start peeling like I'm doing right now.  Just find that.  FM talk.  Get some new mic flags.  These things are going to be all hanging.  It's going to be all ah.  It's going to look like WLIB in here.  Don't put those up.  I'm serious.  They look stupid.  Yeah.  This hasn't been through.  You can't even tell it's a W.  You can't.  Unless you see like the.  I see WFM.  Let's order.  Oh look and then they had to.  They had a blackout with marker. 
[137:30]
 What is that New York's rock alternative or was this New York's classic rock classic  jocks.  What incarnation was this?  Look I think we can wait for the professional flags to come in.  I don't think the press is ready to barge in.  I don't think they're pounding down the door to get a you know a shot of Opie and Anthony  with the brand new mic flags.  Mic flags.  Because that's the only reason they have them I guess.  So when we're interviewed once every five years we're ready.  Yeah you see the big mic flag.  Look I'll pop it right in front of you. 
[138:00]
 How you doing?  Oh where are you?  I got you on radar.  I'm not picking up a visual.  No no.  We can't have those.  Ben you look like a young.  Who's that guy?  The spy who shagged me?  Austin Powers?  You look like a young Austin Powers.  Oh my god.  Yeah.  Leave it to old dirty.  It kind of does.  Oh my god. 
[138:30]
 Yeah baby.  Do I make you horny?  Shall we shag now or shall we shag later?  Very shagadelic.  That's a good one old dirty.  Too bad this is radio and no one else gets the joke.  But Ben helps out the show greatly.  Looks like Austin Powers.  Yeah baby.  Uh oh. 
[139:00]
 What are you going to do Austin?  Leave it to old dirty to point that out.  That's good enough.  Swingin' 60s here I come baby yeah.  Do I make you horny?  That's great.  Very good. 
[139:30]
 You want some breast issues?  It's away from me.  Here's the one Rick.  You had it in your mouth Rick.  Yeah Rick's trying to.  What are you trying to do?  You're trying to make fun of it because it has it in his hand?  Look at the vein.  I know.  Rick just had it like his hands wrapped around it.  Oh so eager.  Eager.  Hey Charlie what's up?  What's up guys have you seen Monica's commercial yet? 
[140:00]
 It aired this morning.  Yeah I've seen them.  I'll be honest she looks exactly the same.  I know she slimmed up a bit but the best part is her kneeling in her middle of I guess the living room.  And sitting there saying oh yeah Jenny Craig's food's got the right amount of carbs.  Yeah because you don't need any more protein.  You dumb bimbo.  There you go.  Alright guys that's a train.  Thank you Charlie very good.  You could perfect technique with this thing.  I don't need to see your technique on the chocolate. 
[140:30]
 Practicing a little cunnilingus on the chocolate.  Alright anyway.  If you thought about it for a minute.  Rick told him it was a chocolate guy's bunghole.  Hey old dirty when are you going to get a job by the way?  Yo what up man I was thinking about that on New Years.  We're thinking about it as we sit here wondering why the hell you're in the studio.  Oh damn you're still unemployed huh? 
[141:00]
 I'm paying that fee to the office of court administration.  You know what I'm saying.  You're the most well dressed unemployed guy I've ever seen in my life.  Little Abercrombie and Fincher.  Let me think.  You got out of jail what? Four months ago now?  On October 13th.  So November.  November.  Almost three months okay.  Almost three months no job and your clothes are much better.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Although we did used to come in wearing like a suit sometime. 
[141:30]
 Yeah that's when I was working at the office of court administration.  Yeah.  Alright we got a question about the Hummer Club.  Oh man it is Tuesday.  Angel what's going on?  Hi.  Hi who's this?  Opi and Anthony.  I was wondering because I was a little bit concerned regarding the Humming Club.  The Hummer Club?  Yeah the Humming Club.  Let's explain the Hummer Club.  A lot of new listeners now that it's a new millennium Anthony.  Yes. 
[142:00]
 We encourage the ladies on Tuesdays to give their guys Hummers.  Okay well yeah I was inquiring about it because my husband last night he asked me when was the last time I had given him a BJ and I told him well where is that coming from?  And I thought that he should have came out and just told me out straight like I want to be part of the Hummer Club.  Ah.  Because he's saying it has to be very consistent.  Is that right?  Well it could be. 
[142:30]
 He's working it.  Yeah there's different levels of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club so it would be good if you continued the Hummers every Tuesday.  Sure.  So I figured I knew he wanted to be part of the Hummer Club and I guess he wanted to be a quater that called in and said oh I'm getting a Hummer today or something.  Well are you going to make him a member or not?  Well that's why I wanted to know what were the rules and what was the...  The rules are simple.  Sometime on Tuesday you give your guy a Hummer, he is part of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club and he can brag to all his friends. 
[143:00]
 That's what I wanted to know. Why specifically has to be on Tuesday?  Because Tuesday is like just a boring day.  Ah okay.  It's just something to look forward to.  Just a boring non-day.  Today's a good day for you to get on your knees.  Alright.  I know what I needed to know. Thank you.  Alright bye.  We got luck we just got a guy a Hummer. There you go.  And with that let's play the Hummer song Anthony.  Hummer lovin'.  This song was banned from our radio show.  Yes. 
[143:30]
 For many months.  Many months.  This guy is taking over and they got like they got some kahunas man.  Balls.  They got some balls.  That's good.  The one new guy he walks around with a wheelbarrow.  And he was able to get this past our legal department.  Why couldn't they do it before?  I don't know.  Make sure those kahunas ain't dipped in chocolate. Hey Rick.  Hey come on man. 
[144:00]
 So we got to thank the guys from Airsick Productions.  Is this the first time we're finally playing the unedited version of Hummer lovin'?  Yep.  I'm feeling good.  Thank you to the new bosses.  We still don't know who they are but thank you.  Rick.  It's Scott Harmon.  Make him stop please.  I don't have to anymore Scott.  Hang up the phone.  You got balls now you prick.

And while they weren't jet skiing they were sunning together  God, that's such a let down 
[154:30]
 Cause Ricky Maher is like Latino and he's like this big sex symbol  It turns out the brother's gay  We don't know  Hold on, hold on  We're learning about defamation of character  Oh yeah, you guys  But we don't know for sure that he's gay  We don't know if he's gay  Confirmed  Totally don't know his sexuality  But the sighting is definitely in the high eights on the fag meter  With this guy then  There's some problems there  My man could get mad  It's the chocolate thing 
[155:00]
 I know, I know  He better watch  But there you go, there's the picture of Ricky Maher  He could get a lot of  If he's gonna take pictures like that and stuff  They look like they're fighting, yo, word up  People might start assuming he's gay  He looks all unshaven  He looks like my girl while I'm screaming at her, yo  He's all depressed, you see that?  And a male buddy soaked up some serious Florida race  Ay, ay, ay  Yo, that's your peach, man  That's your peach  Let's move on 
[155:30]
 Tony, you're next on 1027WATW  Hey, I heard you guys talking about drunk women there before  Women puking  Yeah  I got a great story  I went out at a bar one night  Tried to pick up, pick up a broad  Got her in my car  Was taking her back to her place  She turned around to throw up  The window was closed  She threw up all over the inside of the car and herself  I made her clean it up  Did you?  Oh, yeah 
[156:00]
 The worst is when, yeah, the throwing up in your vehicle  Because you know it's just gonna stay forever  I wanted to get her out of the car right away at that point, you know?  I wanted to just pull over and kick her out  But I dropped her off home, you know?  You give them something forever  You know, diamonds, diamonds are forever  What do you get back? Puking  Puking is forever in a vehicle  Believe me  And all guys do the same thing  You're with a new girl  You're out at a bar, you're drinking and stuff  You're just always convinced that they need just a little more alcohol  Yeah, to get them over the edge 
[156:30]
 But then you always go too far  You're like, oh wow, you're in the bar, everything's cool  You're like making out and touchy-feely and stuff  You're like, she has a perfect buzz  But you're not thinking that  You're like, man, I think she needs a little more alcohol  And it always puts them over the edge  And then nothing happens when you get them home  Over the top  Take a sip  Wack-wack  You know?  Too much booze  That's the mentality we have  We're like, wow, she's doing good  I think she could handle a couple more shots here  And I think it's gonna get really funky back home  Yeah, it's gonna get funky, alright 
[157:00]
 But what happens?  They end up passing out on the way home usually  Preferably in my lap  Then you gotta make believe she's dead  My brother and me have a  You ever hit a drunk girl?  Like, you know, had sex with a really, really drunk chick, yo?  And you're trying to dunk in there and it's all dry  Alright, alright, listen, hold back  You know what I'm saying?  Dry, dry, dry  Me and my brother have a good drunk story 
[157:30]
 Was, god damn, I guess high school age  And my mother going out, going to work  No more jokes, people  She was going out to work, I swear  I promise  And we used to have parties  We used to have parties over the house  And one weekend we weren't having a party  So me and my brother just hanging out  We hear a knock from the apartment downstairs  You can  So we open it up, two girls 
[158:00]
 Two girls downstairs  They're babysitting for the woman that lived downstairs  We're like, oh, they were going, do you have a TV guy?  Because we want to know what's on TV  We're like, TV guy, exactly  We're like, oh, this is great  So we shut the door, yeah, we'll get a TV guy  Shut the door, give her a TV guy  And then say, what are you doing?  Oh, we're just hanging out  Come down a little later once the woman leaves  She hadn't left yet  We're like, oh, cool  So we're just peering out the window  Waiting for the woman's car to leave 
[158:30]
 And what else did we do?  Find whatever booze we had in the house  All we had was anisette  Some anisette, some Italian liqueur  Hey, it's got alcohol in it, who cares?  Well, we go down there  They're just pounding this stuff down  Pounding it down  We're taking little sips because we didn't want to have any  And they got trashed  So the girl that my brother hooks up with  Pukes all over herself, the apartment 
[159:00]
 I think the baby she's watching for the woman  I mean, just projectile vomiting all over the place  Chunks?  Well, it was disgusting, yeah  So now the girl that I was trying to hook up with  Is real concerned about the pukey girl  So I'm done  The pukey girl is puking  So she's done, my brother's done  We had to hump the girl up into the shower upstairs  Undress her and shower her  And it was the most unerotic thing in the world 
[159:30]
 Because it was like bathing  Like I used to wash my horse  It was just nothing, just this lifeless body  What was it, real world Hawaii?  Pretty much  Throw her in, throwing the clothes in the washing machine  Trying to get them sober before the woman downstairs comes home  That never worked  You could try anything, but that ain't happening  I remember them saying goodbye  They're walking out as the woman she came in  And she's taking them back out to the car to drive the girls home  And the one that didn't puke is turned around  She's looking up at the window, waving  Goodbye, call me 
[160:00]
 They're all just nodded  The woman downstairs is so pissed  You guys are nice, huky all over the place  They would have got railed  You can't say that  The difference between us and Dominicans  White boys need to get their women drunk before having sex  You guys like what?  But what are you going to do?  The girl's puking and passing out  And you're just going to nail her  Our women tend to stay hot  Like yo, no lie, my baby's mom's 
[160:30]
 For three years straight, bro  We had sex, no lie  We had sex, there wasn't a weekend  I even think for seven months  All we did was have sex  That's my word  She stayed hot for me, son  And once I had an appetite for that  For her femininity and her hotness  And her lightness and the rice and beans came together  It was awesome, yo  Like three or four times a day, kids 
[161:00]
 Seven months, no lie  Stop bragging  Like smegma  I was shooting smegma at one point  Like hot lava was coming down  All dirty, you're a pisser, man  You are too much  Mike's on line three  He wants to defend two guys riding on a jet ski together  Mike  Hey  Hey, you know, I'm not defending a rickety

 You know, the key's gay, but  Jet skiing, you go crazy  You know, we do crazy buddies  You ride two  It's not gay, man  You don't ride two  No, you can't on a jet ski  No way  Tell me about it  I had one for three years  I had a C-Doo XP  Right  I used to fly around Huntington Harbor  Off Ash Roke in Northport  Out in the Sound, just having a blast  There was not one occasion  Where one of my male friends were on the back seat 
[162:00]
 Of my jet ski  They would come down to the beach maybe  And then I would see them on the beach  Pull the jet ski up, go  Hey, I'll sit by the cooler while you take a run  Yeah, wait your turn  And then you hang out  Because you know what?  Not only, not only  Fuck  But  You can't do half the tricks you could do  When someone's on the back  No, but you know, it's part of that  You know, when you  You do with the Yahoo boys  And you're like, yay  Alright  I mean, you know that  No, no, no, no, you're like, gay  Know how, know how homophobic guys are  I'll go one step further than Anthony even  Let's say

 Let's say Aunt and I  We're in Northport Harbor, Aunt, okay?  Wow  We have one jet ski, right?  Yeah  One jet ski  We know there are two hot broads  At that Ash Roke and Beach that want to do us  Right  Okay?  Yeah  What is the protocol?  Let's say  The buddy go for the girl  Yes  One guy takes the jet ski  And the other guy swims  Absolutely  Wow  Even  Take it over  No, you know what you do?  You take it over  Right  Hang out with one chick  Give the chick the jet ski  She comes back, picks me up  See how much of a hassle is just to make sure there's not a guy holding on to you while you're 
[163:00]
 Riding a jet ski?  Absolutely  I'm just saying, share in the craziness, you know, that's all  Alright  Sharing the craziness?  What craziness is there?  You're on a jet ski  It's bogging down because you got your big dopey buddy on the back  You got a genitalia on your back  Hey, hey, but who goes fucking picking on you?  You aren't crazy  You're talking carelessly  You're crazy  You're talking catching about 9, 10 feet of air over a big lobster boatwick  That's crazy  And you ain't doing that with your friend Bubba on the back  Alright, hold on  Mike, believe it or not, on line 10, a guy that wants to defend you 
[163:30]
 Tom?  Hey, Tom  Hey  Bob?  Tom  Todd, what's up?  You're on with Mike  What's up, man?  Why are you defending Ricky Martin, man?  No, I didn't say I'm not defending Ricky Martin  I think you're the fag, but  You guys on a jet ski are a couple of ass pirates  Arr, we're ass pirates  Arr, I wear a patch over me bum  Hey, man, I'm going to throw more than hope to you  Alright, Mike  Alright  Keep it cool  Good job, Todd 
[164:00]
 Alright  It's just no...  Later  Alright  There's no way to ride a jet ski with your buddy on the back  Get out of here  Jesus, Bob  Before we take a break, Phil, you're next on 1027WNEW  K-O-O-N-A, welcome home  Welcome home  I just wanted to tell you about a story  I used to date this girl from the office  And one day I took her out to dinner  We were out drinking  We had a lot to drink  We had some dinner  And everything was going great  And all of a sudden she threw up in my pants 
[164:30]
 And I had a drive  I dropped her off immediately  What an incredible story  And then I had a drive all the way out to Suffolk County  With that in my pants  And it was like the worst experience I ever had  But I dated her again after that  And she was actually a great date  She must have been real hot  She was  Well, obviously  That big sad ugly pig threw up on me  But we dated again 
[165:00]
 She better throw up cash  I know  I don't know what the hell he's doing  It was like the worst feeling  Driving all the way home  I was like driving home drunk  And I didn't want any policeman to pull me over  Because then they get me out of the car  And they get me out of the car  You're drunk really  How did you get the puke in your pants?  How do you explain that?  If you're a cop though, you see that  I think you've got to let the guy go  He has worse problems than a stupid  They don't know though  He might have thought it was his own puke  From getting drunk  You can't dust for vomit 
[165:30]
 You can't tell whose vomit it was  Thank you Phil  Alright, bye  Where's Austin Powers?  Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Alright  Hey, you know this whole thing with Ricky  It's like you don't see guys  Riding down the street on motorcycles  With guys on the back  It just doesn't happen  We're just too homophobic to have that happen  You got that right  I've got a no-guy policy for my motorcycle  I mean he better be 
[166:00]
 It's a waste of time  I just feel it doesn't make sense  First of all, the whole holding on thing  Exactly  It's just a little much  Call it what you like  Call it homophobic  Call it you're not secure in your own masculinity  No, you know what it is?  Your friend has his arms around your waist  Your friend has his arms around your waist  And his crotch smack up against your butt  And his hot man breath is on the back of your neck 
[166:30]
 Jesus Christ  Like take, look, look  Take that scene  What's the difference?  Take that scene  Lift yourself off the jet ski  Don't move  Prop yourself down on two bar stools  In a club  You're gay  Right?  Just because it's a jet ski or a motorcycle  There, you're snuggled in the spoon position  Now take it, now take it off the jet ski  Turn it sideways  And lay it down on a bed  Oh my God 
[167:00]
 Alright Dennis  Too much, thanks a lot  Thank you  Take care  Getting to the important issues on this radio  As always  As always  See you soon  Never deeper  See you soon  Hey, what's up guys?  What happens if you're driving jet ski with your brother?  Alright, let me tell you something  That's cool, right?  I have four brothers  I don't think I've ever touched any one of them  Not even touched  I don't even touch them  I have four brothers, let me think  I don't think I've ever touched them 
[167:30]
 That's gay  What do you mean?  You've never wrestled with your brothers?  Huh?  You've never wrestled with your brothers?  No, we had pillow fights  Oh come on  You never put your brother in the headlocker family  Wait, wait, wait  Pillow fights isn't that bad?  Can we see your stuff?  Come on, what are you...  Pillow fights  We fight with pillows  We had pillow fights when we were like 10 years old  11, 12, sure  Yeah, we bit the pillows Rick  Yeah, you got me  Oh that one  No, line 10?  I can answer right now 
[168:00]
 No  Alright, hold on  Yeah, let him pop on  Paul  Well, welcome to the A in the Hall Show  Let me ask you something  I don't know about both of you  But let me ask you a question to Anthony  Did you ever ride a motorcycle when you were younger?  Yeah, mini bikes, motorcycles  And when your friend was drunk coming home from the bar  You would never throw him on the back and take him home?  No, that bastard's walking  You were walking?  I'm not riding anybody on the back of anything  I didn't ride anyone on the back of my bicycle 
[168:30]
 Hey look, let me tell you something  Hells Angels all the time ride each other home drunk from the bar  That don't mean there ain't no hormones  And I wouldn't have the balls to say they were  Paul, we're just giving our opinion  And I just can't see doing it  Can't see it  Yeah  Oh boy  Sorry about that before that, Dolby  I didn't mean to hang up on you  But I was cruising into the startle  Alright, you're funny though  So you've held on to like man waist?  I never held on to nobody  I like the front  Oh, you're riding the front  That's even worse  Then you've had a man hold on to your waist  And he breathes on your neck 
[169:00]
 And slams his unit against your butt  Make a hole  No, I gotta sit that close to you  I don't want to fight you  You don't rub your  Aw, come on  Once you start moving and everything  Forget about it  The guy's like right up against you  No, you got two level seats  It's called a hers and his seat  See, get it?  Hers and his  Hers and his  Whatever you ride  Then his stuff is smushed against your shoulder blades  Wherever  Not fucking done it  But I'm running it up on your panty perpendicular  You should be alright there, no?  Okay, well when we get to the portion of the program 
[169:30]
 We like to call What Did We Learn Today?  We can learn Paul's a catcher  Oh, no  You're driving yourself  I hear a train coming  Alright, Paul  Alright, Jack  We have to take a break  But Jack wants to defend this  Jack, go ahead  Alright  Two guys on a motorcycle  Sometimes when I need a ride  To pick up my own bike  I gotta get on the back with one of my friends  But believe me, it's scary  Because you think everyone's looking at you  Like, what quiz?  So yeah, that goes through your head, right? 
[170:00]
 But you gotta do it  And are you holding on to your friend?  What that?  You're holding on to your friend, right?  No, I'm holding on to the gas tank  I do what I want to do  I don't want to fuck him in the worst way  Oh, what?  What is it, like one of those crotch rockets there?  Yeah  And he's all hunched over  Oh, then you're like totally bent over him?  Oh, that is...  Remove the motorcycle  It looks even worse on a crotch rocket  Totally  Totally  But you gotta do what you gotta do  You would never be in that position  With another man in any other circumstance  We're not arguing that 
[170:30]
 But I'm just saying  It just is a little too weird for me  Oh yeah, but how about this?  With the jet bike?  Yeah  Wet bike?  A bunch of us went out to Seaside Heights  There was eight of us  Yeah  We don't have them, so we rented them  But there were seven bikes  We couldn't, like, go back to shore to go get him  So one of us had to take him  Would you agree with that, though?  Well, I think we could say  Who's the fag that didn't just hit the gas and take off?  That's a...  It's just...  It was you, wasn't it? 
[171:00]
 All we're saying is it's a little weird  I understand that there are a lot of guys out there doing this  But it's just...  I don't know, man  You gotta hold...  I try to defend that  You gotta hold doggy-style thing happening on your bike  It's totally like...  Come on  I almost flipped over to 140 just so I wouldn't touch him  Wow  All right, I gotta go, guys  All right, thank you, Jack  Later  Bye  Jack  Ride me  Hold on to the gas tank  Yeah 
[171:30]
 All right, let's give him the reach around  Yeah, that's the reach around  Oh, my God  It's reaching around  Let's take a quick break, Anthony  Hey, Rudy's in the paint bucket  All right, we'll talk about Rudy next  Yeah, B  All right  O.B.N.R. Anthony  We punish ignorance  Hey, ass, turn down your radio  1027  This is 1027 WNEW 
[172:00]
 O.B.N.R. Anthony on your radio  All dirty in the studio  As we speak, I believe Adam Farrar is taping his David Letterman appearance  Oh, that's right, tonight  Tonight, check out Adam Farrar, Anthony's childhood friend  My pal  He's been on the show a million times  You know something?  If Adam had to be on the Letterman show by like 5 o'clock, right? 
[172:30]
 And we're stuck in Jersey with only one jet ski  I wouldn't even take him over  My pal would miss his chance on Letterman because I would not cross the Hudson on a jet ski with Adam  On the back of your jet ski  Hell no  All right  Natalie, what's going on?  Hi, gentlemen  Hello  Hi, I got a question  I'm following the whole jet ski motorcycle thing  I need to know then why is it acceptable and not considered homophobic for in the game of football 
[173:00]
 A quarterback to basically have his complete arm up the guy's rear end of who's snapping it  Well, that is pretty homo, you're right  But that's acceptable to you  You know his laugh as a kid, you know  That's a little weird  Okay, just wondering where you draw the line  You know I played a lot of sports in high school  Can never get into that patting on the ass thing, man  I hated that 
[173:30]
 Happened all the time  High school wrestling  Nice shot and they're patting you on the butt  Or the towel snapping in the shower  The towel snapping in the shower?  That's just total gang  That's folklore  Folk- folklore?  That never happened, right?  Have you ever, come on  I mean every guy that's listening to us had to take showers with all the guys in school and stuff  You never did  Never had the towel snapping going on?  Never did  You guys took showers in high school? 
[174:00]
 Never did  I hated it  Thank you, Natalie  Yeah, you in high school it was probably like a prison rape scene in the shower  Jesus Christ, lockdown  They had showers in all that  I think yo, you know what they did?  They turned the showers into a locker room  You never showered after gym class in school?  Yeah, me?  That's my word, we used to go to social studies  We used to break cologne and all that  Then your head got all freaked out  You're Puerto Rican, Dominican, whatever 
[174:30]
 Cologne shower  Cologne shower, safely  Oh my god  Yo OP man  Cologne  Cologne shower, same thing  It's the Puerto Rican shower man  Let me bathe real quick  I just wouldn't take a shower in class  I was such an introverted little kid in school too  I would just go to my classes, go to gym  Not even change, you know? 
[175:00]
 I'd be the guy with the friggin jeans on, fur coat  Any kind  And just like my shoes  My hush puppies  It was a drag for me  Gym teacher hated me  I developed real late and I'm in the shower  I'm the only guy that doesn't have like freaking  No hair care  Look like a Purdue chicken  You look like young William Ho, dear  A young ass boy  You're gonna be in the shower  Yes dear boy 
[175:30]
 Look like a Purdue chicken leg  Just socked  Oh god, what a cool joke this is  Gym teacher hated me  Really?  I would just come in and  My hair was in that transition  Between straight and going completely  Like bat ass curly  So I had no clue what to do with it  So I would just like leave it  I'd wake up, it was all over the place  You're a kid, you know? 
[176:00]
 And I would just put on like a shirt  And pants, and I'm untalked and stuff  I didn't care, I was just like a  Like I said, like an introverted little kid  I'd just walk around and the gym teacher  This big brawny schmucko  Friggin' militant ass wife  Get over here  Come here  Toes on the line  I'm standing there  Oh yeah, like I'm a soldier now  In the army of this friggin' nut  Toes on the line  To play with a huge oversized ball 
[176:30]
 Yeah, great  I'm standing there and he looked at me  Like he goes down the line  Like he's inspecting the troops  He stops me, he's like  Look at the way you groom yourself, man  Like what?  He did, he said that  Look at the way you groom yourself, man  I'm just looking at him  He's got like these huge friggin'  Muscle man arms and he's just standing there like  What?  You know, what do I know? 
[177:00]
 Look at your hair, why don't you brush your hair?  Straighten yourself up, man  Like I'm at the rehab clinic  I'm a dopey kid  That's how I was, that was it  And the guy like trying to give me some kind of complex  It must have worked, I still remember it  Jesus Christ  You didn't pay attention  Not a bit  When they were showing you the film  Anthony about hygiene and all that  Look the way Mike brushes his hair  Anthony isn't brushing his hair  He's Mr. Bungle 
[177:30]
 See that lice going off Anthony's neck  Anthony doesn't offer Suzy a seat in the cafeteria  Mike always offers Suzy a seat  Anthony's Mr. Bungle  Look at the way he grooms himself  And were you the guy that had like the shorts  The t-shirt  And the denim jacket on?  No, because I didn't groom myself  Remember those kids?  I didn't put the shorts on 
[178:00]
 I didn't change, I stood there  I had my shoes on  And I would just stand there  And like that was it  I didn't care  Oh yeah, all the time  I hated gym  It was the dumbest thing  I wasn't like, because they were the sports kids  Like there were five or so in every gym class  That were just like totally into it  They knew all the freaking teams  And everything  I wasn't into it  I was more into science 
[178:30]
 I was like a nerd  In our school when you took gym too  They made you play stupid sports  Also I'm playing badminton  Why are we playing badminton?  I didn't even care  Westchester Country Club  Run some laps  Where's your uniform?  What is this, the Waffen SS?  My uniform, it's shorts  The gym teachers were the worst  I'm dressed in your uniform  I was like ready to just grab some kind of uniform 
[179:00]
 Alright, here you go, boy scout  There, it's a uniform  You had a guy gym teacher?  Yeah, it was the guy's gym class  You had a girl gym teacher?  We had the dyke Johnny Bull  The girls gym class had the dyke gym teacher  No, we had a dyke one time  Alright, there's a problem  And you were showering  They didn't come into the shower with you?  They were in the same freaking place  They could walk out of their little office  Into the locker room 
[179:30]
 They never did  As far as you know  They weren't going to see nothing on me anyway  I could care less  I don't know, the dyke gym teacher I always remember as being the girls gym teacher  And they shut those big  Separating doors  With the other little door and the accordion door  And that was it  Right before we closed you'd look at a girl and go  Hi girls  See ya  Wait a minute, you're grooming yourself  Man, I'm not a man  I'm a very small lad 
[180:00]
 At this point  And on the other side of that big door  The dyke gym teacher  There was six parties going on, we all know that  The dyke teacher was trying to get a look at the young little  Teenage chick  Alright, we're going to do some rope climbing today girls  Up the rope, I'm going to hold the bottom of the rope here  So it doesn't jiggle around on you  While you're climbing it so much  And we don't want to weigh you down with those cumbersome panties  And shorts  So it's going to be naked rope climbing  And I will hold the rope at the bottom  Yo, now thinking about it 
[180:30]
 Yo, that freaking rope was high  You had to go all the way up to the ceiling for that  Yo, now that I think about it  That thing was high yo  I didn't mind going on the top  Because that's when I finally figured out that  This thing was used for something else  On the rope  Yeah, when I was young  Dude, that is sick  What did he do with the rope?  He was rubbing his thing against the wall  Like pumping it like a poodle on company  Let me find out you were burned  No, I was sliding down and went 
[181:00]
 Oh my god, there's something else going on down there  That's how I figured it out  That's when you discovered your  Look at Rick going sliding  Rick is always trying to turn everything  Into some homo thing  It's the shape of a big  Swede  You're sliding down a long slug  That's what I'm doing Rick  That's exactly what I think  I wish he could see Opie's face when he totally  Rides off Rick  That's the funniest thing  That's exactly what I'm thinking when I'm banging your sister 
[181:30]
 That's just like the big  Roping grammar school  That's what I'm thinking  You think my sister is a big schlong  It's like Rick's sister or a big  Rope from Jim Clive  Let me think about this one for a while  The rope would have been cheaper for me to send on a cruise  You were way out of the conversation today 
[182:00]
 Did you even hear this one?  Oh, okay  I just found out and I was scared  I didn't pay for this cruise  I was praying to God  You barely gave me my 20 bucks back  And you borrowed it for the train  I didn't pay for a cruise  So I'm like sitting here going  I pray Aunt doesn't find out that he paid for my chicks cruise  To fly down to Florida  Go on a cruise  Down in the Caribbean for a week  Fly back to New York 
[182:30]
 Pay for Anthony  You had to pay two of them  I didn't even saw her naked  Not even a picture  I haven't either lately  Where am I sending her for next vacation?  I'm sweating because I'm like  Man, I don't want to pay that bill  I'm making G and G  Oh yeah  I thought it was all on the slide  Like Aunt would never find out  I finally put two and two together 
[183:00]
 It's like wait a minute  I was just hoping you thought it was like a really expensive cruise  It was  Well yeah, for two people  But I was hoping you  I was hoping you got the bill and thought  Wow, that was just a really expensive cruise for one person  I got enough points on the American Express from that cruise to take my own cruise  I paid it  And then I'm thinking  Over vacation I'm thinking 
[183:30]
 I'm assessing finances and everything  After you write the check  And then it's like wait a minute  I go online to do my banking  And I look at any deposits that were in it  There was no deposit  Matching that price  Like I paid for Sandy's cruise  I'll pay you back  It's not your fault  It's not mine either  It wasn't my idea 
[184:00]
 She needed a shoulder to cry on  It's an expensive shoulder for God's sake  Jiminy Cricket  Yumpin' Jiminy  Anyway  There's some great phones waiting to go on the air  But we've got to take a quick break  If you're on hold we're going to go to you next really fast  You've got to pay for me to go somewhere now  Sandy's got to pay for me and you to go sunning and jet ski  They're going to bring the rope? 
[184:30]
 Where's Sandy going to get the money from?  You  Exactly  Exactly  Alright so let's take a quick break  If you're on hold stay right there okay?  More of the Open Anthony Show in just a bit  One must know evil before he can condemn it  Oopie  One must see evil before he can  Venom to the Anthony  This is disgusting and offensive  Very, very cool  What? 
[185:00]
 What? 
[185:30]
 This is fat burner 
[186:00]
 This is the best dodgeball at Elwood Junior High  With Coach Kazaza 
[186:30]
 Trying to give innocent 14 year olds concussions  This guy Coach Kazaza  What a name from the fast  Coach Kazaza  He would take you into  I don't know what it was  The deepest bowels of Elwood Junior High  Into like a boiler room thing  Yeah tell me about it  With the little red dodgeball thing  Remember the sound it made when it hit your head  There you go  And  He would just like  Go at it 
[187:00]
 Like to split up the teams and you play dodgeball  In this padded room in the boiler  It was like some kind of prison experience  And then he'd jump in every so often  The ball bounced off the wall and he grabbed it  Like winging like a howitzer  At your head  What a sadistic basketball  Very sadistic game  In the boiler room what is it the WWF?  It was boiler room match  If you ever turned your back accidentally in dodgeball  You couldn't turn back around  Because you knew the second you turned around  That ball would be right in your face 
[187:30]
 No it  There it is  It had a crazy stink to it  I never got hit in the ground  You know the guy with the big red wealth  On the side of his face  You still got it  The big red wealth  You're out, walk it off  Be a man, take the pain  Take the pain  Let's go to the phones here  Eva, what's going on?  Listen  First 
[188:00]
 You're very funny  And I really enjoy you being funny  You make my day go by quicker  What are you calling David?  And also  What did you say?  I didn't hear you  No problem  You're being silly  The funny thing was  Free for all this afternoon is also very funny  By the way  I wanted to make a comment  But you guys didn't have time for me  The one thing I have to say 
[188:30]
 Is you're being hypocrites  Because it was less than two weeks ago  That you were screaming  That you've never ever been in a shower  With any other men ever  But in high school  It happens a lot  So  You're screaming about  You said just a few minutes ago  Everybody in high school has to take a shower  Blah, blah, blah  And how you're beeping the horn  That's very funny  I think you should look 
[189:00]
 But  You're swearing that you've never ever  That's what you get in a very toxic radio show  Again hit by the 515  Oh, she never saw it coming  Is the caller there?  Ava?  Hello, Ava  No, she couldn't jump out of the way  It feels good breaking that out  For the millennium  Come on  For the millennium  That's what you get in a very toxic radio show  Again hit by the 515 
[189:30]
 Oh, she never saw it coming  For the millennium  That just felt good  She never saw it coming  Getting the first one out of the way  Who's this?  Yo, what's your name?  This is Royal  Alright Royal, what's up?  I guess it's a gym teacher story  And Anthony's a little  Dodgeball story  Kind of ties in  I'm a gym teacher, Mr. Warner  We call it a bombardment 
[190:00]
 We're on opposite sides of the basketball court  Instead of using a red  We only wish we had a red dodgeball  Because we would use half-deflated basketballs  And he would  Go freshman verse  So you've got the varsity pitcher  Winging half-deflated  Basketballs  And then he'd say  Okay, there would be about five freshmen left  And they'd all line up on the wall  Just sort of like targets  And he'd be, okay  You're going anywhere 
[190:30]
 If you hit one freshman  The whole team comes back in  Well, that wasn't good enough  So he devised the penalty box  And he'd get a wrestling mat  And he'd set it up as like a box  On his edge  And if he felt for whatever reason  You were trying deliberately to get out  By like sticking your hand out  Instead of getting it hitting the head  He'd stick it, he'd say, alright  Shirts off, you have to take your shirt off  And then you'd get a mat  And anybody could just walk up to you 
[191:00]
 And whang you, you know, kidneys  What the hell is wrong with him?  Pretty sadistic, a lot of them are  These gym teachers, they're just bitter  There was one in John Glenn  Who, this big fat guy  Used to call him giblets  And he played for the Denver Broncos  Until a leg injury  Like ruined his career  And he ends up being a gym teacher  This guy was so friggin' bitter  He would just abuse the students  It was amazing, he hit some kid with a pipe once  Another time, if he caught you smoking 
[191:30]
 He would give you the option  I will take you down to the office  And tell him you were smoking  Or you get one punch in the chest from me  Get out of here  And then you'd go into the locker room  You'd stand there  He'd wind up and punch you in the chest  So friggin' hard  You'd fly across the room  Didn't you know that's how Harry Houdini died?  Yeah  And when he hit the kid with the lead pipe  That was when he got fired  He hit some kid with a lead pipe 
[192:00]
 I know what is that show  What am I, Mr. Urban Legend guy?  You know me  I only speak the truth  It happened in our school  In John Glenn  Why would he even hit a guy with a lead pipe?  If you knew a kid you'd hit him too  It was that little Slater I think  Let's go to Jeff  What's going on today?  Hey, how you guys doing?  I just wanted to bring back two games  From the old elementary school days  I went to school in Long Island 
[192:30]
 And we used to play with the dodge balls  But there was a big inflatable medicine ball in the middle  That you used to have to hit back and forth  And it was kind of like a tug of war kind of thing  You had to knock the ball back and forth  And then the other one was  When you used the small balls  To play handball  Your hands used to come out  Stinging and all red, broken fingers and stuff  Play asses up handball  Like a wreck  I played asses up  I would never play asses up  I played asses up 
[193:00]
 That sucked  You're standing at the wall  Asses up  Someone takes the ball and wings it at your ass  When you're lost  And you know what the worst part was?  Not when it hit your ass  When someone was real good could ricochet it off the wall  I saw you in the nuts  I saw many games of asses up  I played asses up  That game sucked  The best was when they could really even just get  Like the skin right here  Just wing ya 
[193:30]
 Like  Blow your package on your leg  To the...  You guys have like the awesome gymnasium curriculum  You never played asses up  Or handball  We had handball  And drive by shooting  What else did you have in your curriculum?  We had bagelology  Because we used to go to the corner and try different bagels  And I'd be in the gym class  Yo what you having today? Raisin?  What up man?  I mean in New York City public high schools 
[194:00]
 You know they're  If there's not a football team  You know what I'm saying? The football team and the baseball team  And the basketball team, they get all the props  From the gym teacher  They don't even get to show up  And they'd be like, hey, you got a card?  Oh that's my center, excuse him  And they'll be in gym like for the whole day  But the rest of us, you know  We had to thug it out for two periods playing basketball  And they never gave us  You know, none of that dodgeball  That was wack yo  I think that's why they just throw you basketballs 
[194:30]
 In the city school  Odds on, large percentage of the children  Will enjoy this  Just call them basketball  Doesn't matter  Oh and hey what's up?  How's it going there guys? I got a story for you  Junior high  I swear to god, we used to do square dancing  Yeah, I was there, what was the meaning  To square dancing in school?  I don't know, you know what?  I used to say that same thing, I wasn't going to live down south  To be with all the hicks and living through square dancing  There's one good thing about square dancing though 
[195:00]
 You're lined up and you start counting off  Going, okay, one, two, three  Oh, alright, I gotta change  Places with the guy in front of me  You want that chick, you know?  That was the one thing that brought the two  They flung the doors open  And the boys met the girls  Here come the fillies  And now it's Coen  And you would, you would line up  Like Ope said, you're counting  Because you wanted to be with the girl that you wanted to be with  But unbeknownst to me 
[195:30]
 I wanted to be with Camille, the first girl that  Grew boobies down  There's a girl I wanted to be with that I can't remember  And as I'm counting  A girl is counting to be  With me  So it didn't matter where I ended up  Yes, Pam Bernfeld  I ended up across from her  Who I dubbed president of the Itty Bitty Titty committee  So there was a problem there  And yeah, lined up 
[196:00]
 I just remember, okay, hold hands  Which was kind of cool though  Like junior high  Because they rig you up with these girls and stuff  And you'd have to hold hands  And then when you'd switch partners and stuff, that was kind of cool  And you're holding hands, remember the feeling you got?  It was like, oh girl hand  Oh, it's a girl hand  And she's holding mine all sweaty and friggin clammy  You guys look like backers out there  In the island, oh, Suffolk County  Come on, we're playing banjos in our spare time  Back then anyway  I'm drunk today 
[196:30]
 What if you were sick the day they were choosing  And you come back  I came back one day  And you're stuck with like, you know,  Hanis Helen, who's like this lump in the corner  Just finally strolls out  I would have taken anything back then  Who cares, it's female  You're not thinking about what they look like  You're just like, oh, female  They put that cheesy record on  Yeah, they had the  Yeah, they had the  Bring your partner around  Keep on the head and toe on the ground 
[197:00]
 Come on in  And all of them across the floor  And their mouths to get in  That shall be horror 
[197:30]
 Get the ball  So you're two feet away from each other  When you first start lunging the balls at each other  One of the guys flew on his knee, they cracked skulls  One of the guys got knocked unconscious, got some brain damage  You know  They had those red balls  You could pull on the thing, they were the small ones  So it would be in your head  It would knock you unconscious anyways, man  That was excellent  You guys suck, man, thanks  Tim said, we got a guy in asses up who could hit your sack  From behind every time  I know the guy, he just knows like, oh no 
[198:00]
 Oh, I got asses up and it's against this guy  The ricochet shot  And do the dodgeball sound effect again  And do the dodgeball sound effect again  I love that  And it just flies  It just bounces up your forehead  That was the same ball they used in kickball  That was the same ball they used in kickball  But theirs is sport  Kickball  We had a girl and that's stuck out in kickball  There's nothing more pathetic than stuck out in kickball  Same girl that would pee her pants too 
[198:30]
 That's sad  It was hilarious  Because like where we're from  You went all the way from kindergarten  To high school with the same people  And you remember this girl  As being the one  I won't even give her name because I'm sure she still lives in Centemport  But she would strike out in kickball  And pee her pants  Everyday  Everyday at like 1 o'clock  It's horrible  Where we had the teacher that had the little panties in her drawer  That she had to take and then give it to the girl 
[199:00]
 And she'd come back in the room  To learn some more  This is the same girl we saw strutting around high school years later  Like no one was going to date her  Strutting or just kind of sulking  Sulking  But you remember what she used to do  And no one wanted to like date her  You don't want to be the guy that dated the girl  That used to pee herself  And strike out in kickball  We had like an all-American high school experience  Oh yeah  We were out there where there were white people  We had that 
[199:30]
 Fast times  Yeah it was like fast times  Well during high school winter, same one as Mariah Carey  They just did the show on Fox  And I'm just waiting for the call  To come back to my high school  Oh yeah that phone will be ringing  We need you at Harbourfield  Any records  Yeah spin records in the cafeteria  So we're going to go back to my high school  And then we'll go to Ansa High School John Glenn  And we want to do a live radio show  Well I wanted to last year  I don't know what, maybe we'll have less of a problem this year 
[200:00]
 Since we're so world renowned now  Our show, so popular  Maybe I could get my diploma  From John Glenn  Anthony, you need a graduate  No I needed gym credits  I swear I need gym credits  So I'm willing to come in and attend a gym class  If they give me my diploma  I would damn well do that  Get in touch with John Glenn High School  Tell them I want my goddamn diploma  I'll go to gym  I'll dress in the shorts, I'll climb the rope  That'd be awesome 
[200:30]
 That'd be fun  Then maybe I could get a real job  See kids you don't need a high school education  No kids drop out  You don't need to drop out  Look at your pal Anthony  Colleen what's up  How are you?  I am a female phys ed teacher in New York City  In Brooklyn  And I am most definitely not a bike  You got the short spiky hair on top  Long in the back  You don't have short spiky hair on the top 
[201:00]
 You like looking at the naked little nymphs  Colleen I got a question for you  So why didn't you pay attention in school  I did  Let me see, I don't have this argument all the time  What did you want to be before you said  You know what screw it I'm going to be a gym teacher  Phys ed  I can't tell you  I have 20 credits in science  But I had to take to get a degree  I was going to be a ballerina  I know I was not  That is not my thing  I don't teach dodge ball 
[201:30]
 You didn't have any kind of aspirations  Towards sports or something  Like being the home ec teacher  You didn't think  When you were growing up  You didn't possibly say to yourself  I want to be a female gym teacher  Phys ed  You got a chrome whistle  Come on ladies  We are going to go on a balance beam  We don't have mats  So I will act as the mat today  You don't need those pesky underwear  I will just stand here 
[202:00]
 And look at you  You little thing  Wow, it is still in the shape of a diamond  It is not at all  Even remotely large  It is not at all even remotely like that  I have seen plenty  They are  No, but I am not  You can't love us all together  My husband would disagree with you  What is her name?  He is not going to be happy  He is listening 
[202:30]
 The end drives in his pad  We are just messing with you colleague  That is fine  Bye  A woman's perspective on Jim  Vicky  Hi, how are you doing?  I tried being in 7th grade with a C cup  Playing medicine balls  You had a couple of medicine balls of your own  I did  I was the first one to develop  The guys have never forgotten you  To this day they mention your name  Ready? 
[203:00]
 Ready, I will play it with everyone in the room  First girl that grew boobs  I don't remember last name  First name, 6th grade  Cuba Hill Elementary School  Jerry  What is her name?  Rick  She kicked me in the crotch  Everyone in their car right now is naming a name  For me it was  Camille Brumner  I am flattered  This is terrible  You know what is the problem? 
[203:30]
 He can't think back to 2nd grade  Something kind of old dirty  Just remember the last time you were in school  You guys make me laugh today with this stuff  I got to tell you about the square dancing  The girls hated it but inside they loved it  They wanted to dance with the boys  They had their pegs  You are right, they did pick their pegs  I didn't mind the square dancing because we got to touch females  Even just touching hands was pretty cool 
[204:00]
 If you didn't like the girl you were with  They would do that thing where it is like  Exchange your partner  The four would be going across  At that age they didn't even care  It was female  Girls are different though  That is like 3rd or 4th grade right?  Sometimes you have  They never made it to junior high  It was grammar school  The girls sit together and they go  You can have this guy today  Unless they fight over it  Thank you 
[204:30]
 Thank you Vicky  Are they still C's or they have to D's?  I am very short, they are still C's  You want to square dance  I want to  Brian you are next  Hey O&A?  What is going on?  I went to school growing up in Manhattan  Junior high school, high school, elementary school, everything  We played kill a man with a ball  Remember that game?  In our day it was football, no rules  In our day it was called smear the queer 
[205:00]
 We played that out  We didn't know what queer meant back then  But that was the name of the game  We played it on concrete  Out in the street  I lost one of my teeth  And both teams were running around the park  Looking for my tooth  There was always  There was always a guy  You are playing kill the guy with the ball  And his arm would snap  And the bone would pop right through  There was always one guy  Exactly 
[205:30]
 And growing up in school  We played that in high school  I went to junior high school  I went to the lower east side of Manhattan  And it was more like kill anybody  It turned into kill the white guy  I forget about kill the man with the ball  It was just kill the white guy  Thank you Brian  You are welcome  I want to take a break  But Russ swears he had a midget gym teacher  Hey Russ how you doing?  Forget about it  What's up Russ?

 1027 WNAW, it's Opien Anthony.  Hey, man.  Having a lot of fun today.  I hope you're enjoying the festivities we call the Opien Anthony Show.  Hey, man, save me a pole.  Save me a pole.  Ben from Jersey on the Instant Feedback.  Someone asked earlier if we actually read the Instant Feedback.  Yes, we do.  Yes.  We, you know, everyone has it here now at WNAW.  But when we first got here, we were the innovators of the Instant Feedback. 
[215:30]
 We were the innovators.  Now, Rosie O'Donnell even does it.  Everyone has it.  We had it up in Boston.  Then when we first got here, we had it.  Now, everyone on the station is talking about their Instant Feedback.  We even named it Instant Feedback.  Instant Feedback.  We did.  Now they're ripping us off, Robin.  Ben writes, in high school, we had a girl who must have had a D cup.  All the guys in gym would run alongside her to watch her run around the track.  It was funny watching all the guys turning their heads to see them bounce up and down. 
[216:00]
 I was one of them running alongside of her.  Love the show, guys.  Thanks, Ben.  Very good.  All right.  Just looking at the phones.  After that medley, I'm exhausted from the Ricky Martin thing.  I'm still laughing.  Any guy writing a song or singing a song, I don't know.  Does he write his songs?  I wouldn't think so.  No, that's one of those like made guys.  Face man, yeah.  Yeah, but shake your bon-bon. 
[216:30]
 Shake your bon-bon, yes.  What's a bon-bon?  Why are you shaking your bon-bon?  All right.  Everyone has gym stories.  I guess we got a little there.  We're going to continue with the gymnasium?  Well, I don't know.  It's almost...  Is it okay with you, Old Journey?  Yes.  Old Journey now producing the show.  Why are you beating him?  Man, I want you guys to fight.  Let's go.  Fight Club 2000?  Yeah, let's go, man.  He beamed you in the head with the ball.  You got me in the neck.  You be instigating too, bro. 
[217:00]
 So?  Hope he is.  Right away, he's like, oh, he's saying hit him in the face.  Should have like dodge ball in the air, right?  Yeah.  That's not a bad idea.  I'm not going to give him a dodge ball, man.  Although with that football, you guys throwing around all the friggin' time.  Why have to play?  Stop it.  What happened the other day in the office, Rick?  You guys are throwing around the ball.  It hits your big huge coke from McDonald's and spills it all over the desk. 
[217:30]
 All right, so you see accident pain.  Don't you friggin' throw that at me.  Ugh.  And put down the chocolate penis.  Could we get the chocolate penis out of the studio?  There it goes.  Give it to some Rick.  Ah, Chris, you're next here.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  I had a statistic gym teacher in school.  The last guy in the locker room whiffed a ball at bat across the back of the legs.  Oh, ouch. 
[218:00]
 He used to call it the inky dinky do.  Is there a name for it?  Yeah, the name for it and everything.  Man.  You want to see a stampede trying to get out of the locker room before class.  Right.  All right, Chris.  All right, take care, guys.  Thank you.  Old Dirty, earlier you said you had comments about our fine mayor, Rudy Giuliani.  Oh, yeah?  Who said that?  You got a problem with him?  You did.  You went, man, Rudy.  Traffic deaths soar despite Rudy rules. 
[218:30]
 What can Rudy do about traffic deaths?  Well, that's his whole thing.  He puts his gates and all that.  But the fatalities have risen.  But that comes from people driving like a-holes, people with their cell phones not being able to drive.  I was driving by, what's the name of that place, man?  Tarzan?  Tarzan?  Yo, yo, yo, what's up, man?  This is the 12,000, bros.  Yeah, you're driving. 
[219:00]
 Well, no matter where it's by.  I was driving in Radio City.  Oh, OK.  And that was on, blablabla, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see.  Yeah, like two days before New Year's.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Taking it up.  What's your problem, man?  I'm not doing nothing, man.  What?  Go ahead with your cute little story.  So then, yo, I'm trying to whip it through the city and I'm on this corner.  Yo, the people don't pay attention to the walk, don't walk sign.  Right.  The touristy.  I'm trying to cross the avenue. 
[219:30]
 And, you know, they wouldn't get out of the way, man.  Look, he's jumping.  No, I got to agree with him.  Get out of the way.  The people, they don't care.  I'm speeding through intersections.  I got a green light.  There's some jadrull doing the, like, just kind of...  Waltz scene.  Just Waltz.  You know, if you're going to run and make a sport out of it, I don't care.  I'll try to clip you.  See if you can make it to the curb. 
[220:00]
 It's a fun little game.  But when you're just kind of sauntering across the crosswalk...  They waltz and give you the look.  That's right, mother.  I'm waltz.  Not only that.  I'm at...  Okay, let's say you're at the red light.  Wait.  And they have the flashing don't walk, which means finish up, finish up.  It's not going to be the flashing for a few moments.  And someone steps off the curb on the other side at that moment and just...  Strolls across.  If that don't walk is flashing and you want to bolt across and see if you can make it 
[220:30]
 before the light turns green and I take off like a top fuel dragster and maybe clip you,  that's fine.  But don't...  They just walk so slowly.  They step off the curb right when it goes to don't walk.  And then they look at you like...  And the ones that hold their hand up like, hey, stop.  Oh, gee, yeah, we're just going to plow over you before you put your hand up.  But he's right.  But he's right.  He's absolutely right.  That's probably why there's more fatalities.  It's the pain in the ass pedestrians. 
[221:00]
 He's damn tourists, yo.  Tourists.  They're all tourists.  I was shouting at them, yo, out the car window, screaming at them.  I'm pointing at the side.  I'm like, you mother pluckers.  Don't you see the sign says don't effing walk.  Don't walk.  Don't walk.  And I was like this, rubbing the hand.  You know, my sister's going crazy.  The cops are after you.  Yeah.  They were laughing at me, man.  I'm like, yo, do something.  Yo, that...  Oh, man, I feel like just punching Rick in the face, man. 
[221:30]
 So you think Rudy did a good job with the whole Millennium celebration there, O.D.?  Yeah, yo.  No, I don't know.  It was there.  He did a great job.  He penned up the people like cattle.  I loved it.  We were like sheep.  I looked down onto Seventh Avenue.  Every block, they had metal cages.  People were in cages.  They had a little strip down the side of the block so emergency vehicles could get through.  But then they caged people up for like nine to 12 hours where you couldn't leave your cage. 
[222:00]
 If you left your cage, you could not get back into your cage.  So you had to crap and whiz in your cage.  It reminds me of when they hosed me down.  Damn you all to hell.  It's a madhouse.  A madhouse.  My God, I came to Times Square to see the ball drop, a beautiful water for crystal ball.  And what do I get? 
[222:30]
 Giuliani caged me up like an animal.  I wore nothing but a loin cloth.  Thank God it was warm that night.  And I was caged up with other humans.  That's where I met Nova.  Nova.  I gave her my own water for crystal ball.  Damn you.  Then when the troops came in to hose down the crowd.  Damn you, it's a madhouse. 
[223:00]
 A madhouse.  My God, Mounted Police, they were those big gorillas on the horse.  Like the ones that cut out my friend's brain.  You know that guy that cut out my friend's brain on Planet Hitch?  Did he not look like Lord Comover?  That hair job, my God.  Lord Comover, look how he's gray.  But I watched as the millennium spun over into 2000 from a cage. 
[223:30]
 Damn you, Giuliani.  We are not animals.  Yes, boy, it was hard to keep my horse in the cage.  I was stepping on some homeless.  I think I saw Ziggy.  Damn you.  Ziggy and Dr. Zane, they look alike and they smell alike.  Like dirty ink.  Damn you. 
[224:00]
 They caged everyone up.  So you look down 7th Avenue, all you saw was cages.  And then the intersections which were blocked off by the Blue Police barricades.  You couldn't move.  They did a bang up job of keeping everybody pinned up.  But then they're taking dumps and whizzing.  Do you know who was actually doing that?  Yes.  Do you know who was reporting that?  I swear to you too.  Tom Brokaw.  I'm not kidding. 
[224:30]
 He was talking about how the people, if they needed to take a dump or a leak, they couldn't.  They had to stay in their little caged in area.  Here it is.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  It's 3 p.m. Eastern Time, six hours before the wall drops in Zion Square,  as again the new millennium, millennia.  And people have been pinned up for hours, are taking whizzes and dumping here on 7th Avenue.  Please no pooping, no taking jumps on this millennium eve. 
[225:00]
 The beautiful Waterford Crystal Balls will be dropping here in Time Square.  And I have to look at dumps dropping all over Time Square.  Look, there's Katie Kirk squatting in front of the Olive Garden here in Time Square.  Unbelievable.  Watch out for Al Roker.  Oh my God.  Al Roker. 
[225:30]
 Look at everyone urinating.  A golden river.  Just flowing down 7th Avenue to hear my high above purchase.  I've been awake for days.  I think I'm going to go uptown and cop some crack.  Try to stay awake for the millennia.  Oh look, here goes Matt Lauer being washed away in a river of urine. 
[226:00]
 As we bid farewell to Matt Lauer as he goes down one of these storm drains.  The manhole covers welded shut. I fear we shan't see Matt Lauer again.  And Katie Kirk still pounding him down like the drunken slob she was.  My God. Katie.  Tell them what happened to Al Roker.  Al Roker, he's high atop the building.  It is not a waterford crystal, it is owl. 
[226:30]
 I've impaled big fat Al Roker on the pole and he will be dropped at midnight ushering in a new Malina.  As he hits the pavement below, Al Roker will be ushering in a new Malina.  Now I too have to take a dump.  And I don't have any bathroom facilities either.  I'll go outside of MTV studios, see if I can hook up with my homie Puff Daddy.  Where he can escort me to the best place to take a dump. 
[227:00]
 Tom Broga, have you seen him?  That's right Katie.  Here I am, high above Times Square on this Malina.  Oh my goodness.  Maybe this will straighten out that dopey list I have.  I'm a little backed up.  Oh, that was a good one.  Tom Broga, MTV. 
[227:30]
 My goodness.  Look at that.  My new thing.  Right on cue.  That's hitting the post and look, I hit Katie.  Oh, that one's going to hurt.  I had some handy wipes.  Thank you Tom for stopping by.  No problem.  I'll just stay a little steward right here on the console. 
[228:00]
 Very good.  Well we only have a few minutes left in the show.  You guys want to play a quick run of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Yes.  Our phone number is 2127...  212727?  What?  Was it a 757?  No.  No wonder no one's called.  I've been given the wrong phone number for two days.  Look, they got the number wrong.  No, it's 2127571027.  Right.  Let's go to the phones and play, Anthony. 
[228:30]
 All right, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Why don't you look at the instant feedback and we'll take care of the phones as well at the same time.  Yes, we'll look at that, a dual effort.  Tim?  What's up guys?  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that if in the middle of the ocean I'm drowning and a guy comes up on a jet ski, kiss my ass goodbye.  That's it.  Because I am not getting on.  Rather drown than be on.  I'd rather have one of the honeys from Baywatch, but with my luck it's not.  It's going to be David Hasselhoff on a goddamn jet ski.  Very good.  Later guys.  Thank you.  That's a good one to start off. 
[229:00]
 What did we learn?  Andrew, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned a couple things, guys.  First...  You got to dump out of that, so why don't you say it again.  All right, sorry about that.  Nick likes big chocolate penis.  There you go.  Very good.  And second, I learned that Paul is a cat.  Very good.  Very good, Andrew.  Thank you very much.  It was a pleasure.  We love the obscure references.  No one else gets it, but if you were listening earlier you would have got that one. 
[229:30]
 That's very funny.  Matt, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  What I learned?  Yeah.  I learned that Opie's a big homo for taking a shower in school.  I wasn't the only one that showered after him.  Come on.  Some of the guys never took showers in school.  That is a lie.  Plus, I was on a bunch of sports teams.  I had no choice.  Hey, I played football in high school.  I never took a shower in that stupid locker room.  All right, then I'm the homo today.  Thank you, Matt.  No problem.  All right. 
[230:00]
 Love you.  What was that?  Chris, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  I think I'm learning that your shows become obsessed with homos.  Why would you think that?  I only tuned in for about a half an hour, 45 minutes earlier on my way home from work.  It was just one gay bit after another.  Yeah, we had a gay montage earlier.  We went from a whole gay discussion into J-more having gay sex into Stephen Lynch's If I Were Gay. 
[230:30]
 It was a theme that we picked up from the Ricky Martin article.  What if it was somebody who just turned into your show for the first time?  Then they would think that we have a gay show.  Yes.  Chris, do you think we care?  Probably not.  All right.  Then you tune in tomorrow and think we have a racist show and then a sexist show.  You're like, oh my God.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Chris.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Let's move on. 
[231:00]
 Anything on the answer feedback?  What do we learn in?  No, no.  People not able to get through, I guess.  All right, Matt?  What's up?  What's up?  What did you learn on the show?  I'm like a functioning idiot without a high school diploma who can get a job in a radio.  Oh, come on.  A functioning idiot, my friend.  He's an idiot, but he can function.  Hey, hey, hey.  You guys, you ought to go to the website, www.mulletsgalore.com.  Yeah, people have been emailing us that address for a while.  Yeah, what's that all about?  The auntie should be in there.  All right.  Thank you.  You got it.  Bye.  I don't get that. 
[231:30]
 I mean, I went to it.  Mullet is like the hockey hair.  I totally don't have that.  Hockey hair, which is real.  No, you don't have the hockey hair.  Hockey hair is like real long in the back, and everything else is like a short haircut.  The guy wanted to make a statement, I guess.  Rob, what's up?  Rob?  Did we lose Rob?  We lost Rob.  All right, let's go to Nick.  Nick, what did you learn on the show today?  What?  You're up, Nick.  Oh, thanks.  I learned that Nigerians eat dogs as well as Asians do. 
[232:00]
 And that Asian guy, he hates Puerto Ricans.  Yeah.  As well as everybody else.  All right?  All right.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  Very good.  Later.  Too funny.  Like I said, I learned if you work at FM Talk or any W, you instantly lose 10 years of your  life knowing that Scott Herman looks 10 years younger now, that he's not responsible for  this place anymore.  Very good.  All right, let's move on to Paul.  Paul, what did you learn today?  Today, I learned on the Opie and Anthony Show that when you're married, you have to have 
[232:30]
 a separate bank account.  Or you'll be sending Opie's chick on vacation.  Take care, guys.  All right, Paul.  I didn't think anyone picked up on that, Ed.  Oh, yeah.  They pick up on everything on the show.  Rich.  Yeah, I learned that Opie likes to rub himself off on a rope.  Shut up.  I was, come on, he hangs up.  I can't even fight back.  I was in third grade.  You didn't fight back. 
[233:00]
 You did.  I was in third grade.  You did, man.  Rub yourself off on a rope.  I was sliding down a rope.  I learned to buy a motorcycle with a sidecar.  That's a band in Jersey.  That's very good.  I'm waiting for Spass to scream more of these calls because they always suck.  We just go to them cold and I learned that N.E.W. plays more Ricky Martin than K.T.U.  Yeah, today you're absolutely wrong.  I've got a bomb.  I took a bomb, boss. 
[233:30]
 I took a bomb, boss.  Yeah.  Another 20 minutes.  I know, I know.  Well, as we wait for a couple more calls, don't forget to check out Adam Farrar on David  Letimer tonight.  Yeah, man.  On Letimer, my pal.  Look at that.  Very, very proud that Adam will no longer be on our radio show because he'll be too  big for us, but that's okay.  Who?  I'm sure.  When am I going to get on Letimer, kid?  I need an act.  Adam's honed his act for years. 
[234:00]
 I saw his first gig at Eastside Comedy Club.  He's doing hack jokes about Gilligan's Island.  Like the coconut and radio thing?  Right.  But you know what it was?  It was his personality and persona that came through.  I don't got persona.  And he was recognized by people in the biz and kind of picked them up.  And for years he's been honing his craft.  He's been on his knees.  And now he's on Letterman.  Alright.  Frank, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that Anthony likes to pay for girlfriend's trips. 
[234:30]
 No, you didn't learn that he likes to.  You learned that he did.  Did you get to pay for my girlfriend's date, Deegra?  Yeah, sure.  We should have a promotion where one of our lucky listeners gets Anthony to pay for his  girlfriend's trip.  We already did and you won.  You're the only winner.  You're the only winner, Opie.  How funny would that be, man? 
[235:00]
 Thank you, Frank.  That would be hilarious.  Alright, how many wrestling tickets can we give away?  Two pair.  Two pair?  Alright.  Well, we had a lot of fun today.  Yes, we did.  I don't know what we accomplished but we got absolutely nothing.  Thank God.  Because when we accomplish something it's usually getting ourselves in trouble.  So I think we did well today.  We got to thank Old Dirty for stopping by.  Yeah.  Always a pleasure to see you.  Yeah.  Alright, we got two pairs of tickets.  What is this for? 
[235:30]
 Oh, just for the Continental Arena?  That's pretty cool.  A couple pairs of tickets to the WWF January 16th.  They're going to be at the Continental Arena.  And we got tickets all this week.  And we'll give a pair to the 10th caller and 11th caller.  212-757-1027.  With that, we're out of here.  Yo, PR, call you tomorrow.  He's giving shout outs.  This is a multi-million dollar beeper for Old Dirty.  For Old Dirty.  I'll be home in a minute, man. 
[236:00]
 Don't worry.  Like 8 o'clock, you know.  Give or take.  Alright, we'll end with Dave.  Dave, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that there is such thing as a Puerto Rican virgin.  Alright, Dave.  With that, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Very good.  Later, man.  O.B., you're a sick ass man.  Anthony, you're not a jackass.  You're obviously a stud.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027. </pre>
