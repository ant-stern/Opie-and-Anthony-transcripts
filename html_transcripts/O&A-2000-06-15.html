<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment dominated by listener calls reacting to recent Central Park assaults and Reverend Al Sharpton's response.  Callers, including a police officer, vehemently criticized Sharpton, using offensive racial slurs and misogynistic language, accusing him of hypocrisy and demanding proof of his claims.  The hosts joined in the criticism, playing a satirical song about Sharpton throughout the segment.  The discussion veered into a humorous aside about the hosts' failed attempt to meet Sarah Jessica Parker on the *Sex and the City* set and a surprisingly dull call from a high school teacher about field trips.  The segment concluded with extended promotion of the upcoming "55-gallon drum challenge," involving women enduring unpleasant substances for a cash prize, and a brief discussion of *Survivor*, focusing on the rat-eating segment and speculating on the show's production techniques.

The following segment largely centered on *Survivor*, with listeners debating the show's authenticity and criticizing its perceived staging, contestants' cleanliness, and unrealistic challenges.  Racial and sexual stereotypes within the show were also discussed using offensive language and crude jokes.  The hosts repeatedly used the "syndication" joke as a punchline, frequently prompting callers to hang up.  Other humorous moments included discussions of the contestants' physical attributes and the details of challenges, like the "caterpillar larva challenge."  The hosts also discussed a pump-and-dump stock market scheme, sharing anecdotes from listeners who experienced financial losses from penny stocks, with a caller referencing the movie *Boiler Room*.  The "55-gallon drum challenge" was again promoted, along with comedic commentary on the Crocodile Hunter.

The next segment focused intensely on the logistics and safety concerns surrounding the "girls in barrels" stunt.  The hosts discussed ticket sales, listener contributions of materials (with safety caveats), and the 2 PM broadcast schedule.  A caller, Rick, warned against suffocating the participants.  The segment featured "What's in My Pants" with a caller, Chrissy, who disrobed on air while describing her bedroom, prompting sexually suggestive comments from the hosts.  Another caller reported heavy traffic near the studio due to promotional events. Numerous calls addressed the stunt's safety.  The hosts then discussed a previous radio station stunt in Endwell, New York, where a fake Britney Spears appearance resulted in a woman's death from cardiac arrest, mocking the involved station (WMRV-FM) and its staff. A Bud Light commercial aired, followed by more calls about the "girls in barrels" event and the listener's death.  The segment concluded with mentions of Psycho Mark at a Hooters calendar signing and Opie attending a *Jekyll & Hyde* Broadway show starring Sebastian Bach.

The final segment heavily featured Opie's upcoming *Jekyll & Hyde* Broadway experience with his girlfriend.  The hosts and numerous callers, including Bob, Sam, and Adam, along with many others, ribbed Opie for attending, using homophobic slurs and sexually explicit jokes.  A recurring gag involved callers chanting "Can we see your stuff?" regarding Opie's genitals.  Discussion included a possible "hummer" for Opie after the show. Listeners shared unrelated anecdotes and comments.  A clip of a *Jekyll & Hyde* song was played, furthering the mockery.  The segment included promotional mentions for Time Out New York magazine and the "55-gallon drum challenge," with references to Sebastian Bach, Stan Lee, Jack Wagner, and Gilda Radner (along with a mispronunciation of Rosanna Arquette's name).


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Powered by Opie and Anthony, owned by Infinity Broadcasting, this is 1027 WNEW News, New York.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  I love these music fans. Thank you, Psycho Mart.  Graham Stein! 
[00:00:30]  All right, let's go right back to the phone.  Hey, Dean, what's going on today?  What's up, OMA? How you doing?  Great.  Listen, I saw a wow start at the Meadowlands on Channel 7 Sports yesterday.  Man, wow was all over live TV yesterday.  Yeah.  They were all down at the Meadowlands for the Devils' victory celebration.  I heard when Whitman took the stage, people were chanting, whip them out, whip them out.  Yeah.  That was cool, man.  Who wants to see those?  I don't know.  Listen, let's, we all know Reverend Al's an idiot. 
[00:01:00]  Let's take it a step further.  Let's say that the dude shut the whole thing up.  I mean, you know what I'm saying?  He set it all up, yeah.  All right.  But I mean, as crazy as he is, well, let's go a step further on our end and say that he planned the whole thing.  He knew the cops wouldn't do that.  I just want to see video of the victims that he brought forward.  I want to make sure they got fondled.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  You can't believe anything that the good reverend says these days.  He's a liar.  He's a proven liar.  His track record speaks for itself. 
[00:01:30]  I want to see the video of that lovely African princess with those huge, huge cans getting fondled.  Yes.  And then I'll believe it.  Let's go to Michael.  He's a high school teacher.  Michael!  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  What's going on today?  All right.  Just a couple of things.  I don't want to take up too much of your time.  Are you the cool high school teacher?  I would say I'm a pretty cool high school teacher.  Yeah.  I'm very, very nice.  Like you bring the class outside for class and stuff?  No, not really.  I'll be honest with you.  You're not the cool teacher, though.  There are a couple of things I can touch upon.  No.  What? 
[00:02:00]  You're not the cool teacher, then.  No, right, right.  I'm a good teacher, though.  But no, honestly, one of the reasons why I don't bring them outside actually does relate to this.  All right.  There's a lot of different ramifications in the New York City school system.  There are a lot of good kids, and there's a lot of kids that are called misdirected or misunderstood.  Misdirected.  And so we'll leave it at that.  But I do know that a lot of these trips that they want to run outside of the school, there's so much paperwork and red tape, and you can't just take one class.  You have to take them all, and they know that you're not going to be able to because you have to get all your classes covered. 
[00:02:30]  It has to do with how much are the parents willing to give to us as a backing to get their kids exposed to different things.  And what I've noticed is that with Al Sharpton, if you want to bring him up, he is not supporting the PTAs at all in the school systems.  Boring.  Well, maybe I am boring.  Boring.  What I'm noticing, though, is that, unfortunately, with this situation with these children, I call it walking the street syndrome, because whenever I drive my car to work, they don't stop at the lights at all. 
[00:03:00]  They walk through the street, but they're really not well-trained and not reared correctly.  And they act out the same way that they did in the park, but they do it in the school system.  They're not allowed to have to take them out of the school systems and train them in a better way.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Oh, my God.  Dude, we're not...  He hung up on himself.  He was like a teacher.  We're not WABC, man.  I felt like I was sitting there.  Oh, I'm ready to doze. 
[00:03:30]  We're not ABC.  Let them bore you to death with that crap.  We'll make some points, and we'll get stupid with the subject, and we'll move on.  That's what ABC does.  And they blow.  Yes.  Seth, what's going on?  Seth, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you, Seth?  I'm all right.  I know where they're taping Sex and the City today, if anybody's interested.  Are they taping right now, or a little later? 
[00:04:00]  You know the time?  They're doing it right now.  Where?  As we speak.  Where?  They are on Park Avenue between 27th and 28th by a restaurant called The Globe.  The Globe.  Okay.  Park Avenue between 27th and 28th Street?  Yeah.  Remember, we love Sarah Jessica Parker, so please go down there and say Opie and Anthony  loves you.  All right?  Don't abuse her until we meet her.  Yeah, please.  Don't wreck it for us. 
[00:04:30]  Are we supposed to do that?  Thank you, Seth.  You guys with this piece of crap cell phone.  All right.  We're going to let you go, then.  We're supposed to do that, right?  We did everything on our end, Anthony.  We called the publicist, and we told the publicist we're game.  We're willing to go down to the set of Sex and the City and take the abuse that Sarah  Jessica Parker wants to throw at us.  Yes.  We'll take it like men, and then we'll move on.  Yeah.  And she said, we'll get back to you, Seth.  Oh, the blow-off, maybe?  That's all right.  At least we did our part.  She was here on the cover of a TV guide this week, Sarah Jessica Parker and the three 
[00:05:00]  other girls that are on Sex and the City.  Yeah.  Well, she challenged us to go down to the set, and we accepted the challenge.  We'll see where it goes from there.  Yeah.  The ball is in their court, so to speak.  Yes.  All right.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, you're next on WNAW.  Jason!  Hey, hi.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  I want to say, I think you guys are doing a great job as far as backing up the police  department, because I'm a police officer myself, and let me tell you something. 
[00:05:30]  Dealing with this guy, in my opinion, he's a real moron.  I mean, I haven't dealt with him personally, but, I mean, he's so quick to say that the  cops aren't doing this and they're doing that.  But in the meantime, you know, it's like, well, you aren't there, and you don't know  what happened.  He's always quick to judge us.  And, I mean, basically, this man, in my opinion, he's like a total moron, in my opinion.  Yeah, jerk off.  He's not even quick to judge you guys.  He sat on his big, fat ass and was trying to figure out how he could spin it in his favor.  How could I spin this so it looked like the police are at fault?  Right, because, I mean, remember, on Monday and Tuesday at night, we're all over the radio 
[00:06:00]  going, where's Reverend Al, where's Reverend Al?  Because, I mean, let's face it, the pictures they're showing all over the TV and in the  newspapers and stuff, it's all his community.  It is.  I mean, so I'm like, obviously, he's going to hide in his little Reverend Al bat cave  and let this blow over, but in the white neighborhood where he lives and sends his kids to a private  white school.  Right.  So then he sat on his fat ass and he figured out a way to spin it in his favor, and he  got these two black victims, and now he's going for the jugular again. 
[00:06:30]  I want proof that those two girls get fondled over the weekend, because you can't trust them.  I agree with you 110%.  I mean, like I said, this man is so quick to judge the police, but in the meantime, the  man should look at himself, because in my opinion, he's got no brains in my opinion, and  I think he's very racist.  Well, a good example of this whole thing is Reverend Al Sharpton is pretty much the most  publicized black leader in New York City, would you say? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, by far.  Like, if you say, name a black leader of the people in New York City, I think everybody  would say, well, Reverend Al.  Yeah, I don't even know who would come in second.  And under his reign, let's say, over the past few years since we've heard of him, look at  what's happening.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  The guy's obviously not doing that good a job.  If his constituency is running around like maniacs, assaulting women in the park. 
[00:07:30]  You know, maybe it's time to find someone else.  People, listen to me, black people.  Listen to me.  And shouldn't he be a lot thinner with all the running he does from victim to victim?  I got a victim in Staten Island.  I got a victim in the Bronx.  I got a victim here in Manhattan.  You don't work off much weight being limoed from place to place.  From victim to victim?  With no known job.  I don't know what he does to make all this money that he, to buy those nice suits and 
[00:08:00]  to limo himself around.  Hey, Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, douche nozzles.  What's up?  What's up?  How are you, man?  Hey, let me ask you something, man.  Yeah.  How come if a bunch of black guys or Hispanics do this, it's called wilding.  But if white people do it, it's called a hate crime.  Yeah, I don't get it.  You know?  Hey, let me ask you something.  Lock and load.  Protect your family.  Start burying weapons, man.  And the day is going to come.  All right, Jimmy.  It's going to come.  My shack in Montana, Opie.  Lock and load, right wingers?  I have a shack in Montana. 
[00:08:30]  Dutch, you're next on NEW.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you, Dutch?  I'm very aggravated, like everybody else.  Yeah.  What do you just suppose, let's say, the cops did go in there.  And they direct these misdirected children with a couple of swings and a nightstick.  Right.  And even though the victims were all, you know, it was racially racist, do you think  he would even be, do you think he'd come forward?  Do you think Reverend Al would come forward?  Yeah.  Do you think he'd bring the two black girls out? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, if they did go in there and straighten out the situation, break some heads and everything.  Without a doubt.  No, then he would have two of the guys that got hit by the police up there, and he'd be  suing the cops for hitting them and abusing these poor children who were just trying to  have a little fun at the parade.  Before that, though, he goes, hey, you know, they don't look bad enough, punch them in the  eyes a few more times.  That's what he would be doing.  Garen effing teed, if the cops would have reacted and broke that up by twisting some arms  and knocking some heads together, he would have been up at the podium in front of the 
[00:09:30]  news with two of the poor youths that were so horribly abused by the police department.  Go ahead.  I know what you're saying.  And as far as, like, everybody having a big hard-on for the cops, you're not doing anything  wrong.  You have nothing to worry about, right?  Yeah, that's what I think.  You know, I live my life.  I don't know.  You're not effing up.  I mean, doing all this weird crap.  I mean, you got nothing to worry about.  Hey, of course you're going to run into scumbag cops.  I mean, I'm not stupid over here. 
[00:10:00]  But for the normal person running through life, if you're pulled over by a cop or pulled  aside and questioned, and you act like a human being, you're respectful, you answer the  questions, you haven't done anything wrong, there's no problem.  They let you go.  You turn away.  You're like, hey, thanks a lot.  Whatever.  Okay.  Whatever.  You guys rock.  Send the case you're in.  Anthony's girlfriend gets a license.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Bye.  Plus, I forgot to tell you before the show.  We got a lot of hate mail for supporting the cops. 
[00:10:30]  They assume there's like an ulterior motive.  Let me tell you something.  I can't remember the last time I needed a cop in my life.  I can't tell you the last time I was pulled over.  I don't even drive a car anymore, so it's not about that and PBA cards like you guys think.  I have hundreds of them.  I'm not going to lie, but I don't need them.  I don't drive anymore.  And the neighborhood I live in, I don't need cops.  Right.  They're not a part of my everyday life.  Calling the cops and I don't understand.  For a group of people that hate the police so much, why are they so involved in that neighborhood, in those neighborhoods? 
[00:11:00]  I don't understand.  And as far as Reverend Al goes, I don't see how stupid black people can be by keeping this guy as your leader and spokesperson.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  This guy's fleecing his own people for cash.  He doesn't want things to get better because that would put him out of money.  I can't even say a job because it's not a job. 
[00:11:30]  And why is everyone calling him a reverend?  The Reverend Al's job.  Where did he get that reverendship?  Was it on the back of the matchbook that I had also draw Winky to become an artist?  You could also become a reverend?  You know, what a tool.  You know, if the communities hate the cops so much, cops, just clear out of these neighborhoods.  Let's put a huge fence around these neighborhoods and see what happens.  You can't because then when they kill each other, then they blame the police for not being there and helping. 
[00:12:00]  But then if the police break it up and someone gets hurt in the melee, then the police are blamed for breaking it up.  It's a no-win scenario because they don't want a win.  They don't want it resolved.  As long as there's tension, Reverend Al keeps getting money.  The more tension there is, the more Reverend Al's face is on TV.  He doesn't like when it's nice and peaceful around here.  Can't have it both ways.  No.  You've got to support the cops or not, and we'll just build a huge fence and let you guys go at it. 
[00:12:30]  You don't even have to support the cops.  Just, like I said, act like a human.  Act like a human effing being when you're pulled over or approached by the cops.  Unbelievable.  Hey, Rob, you're next on N.E.W.  All right, then.  No, you're on.  Hey, what's up?  O&A, this is Rob.  I'm NYPD Sergeant.  All right, what's up? 
[00:13:00]  Listen, everybody's overlooking the main tragedy in this park on Sunday.  You know what that was?  What?  That Bruce Springsteen's wife wasn't groped in the park by that group.  Yeah, could you imagine that?  Bruce's wife walking through.  All of a sudden, she's getting diddled by a group of frigging pigs.  And, hey, listen, Reverend Al, he should have been groped, too.  Listen, the cop's doing a great job.  My big breasts.  Somebody groped my big breasts and my fat booty.  It's such nonsense blaming the cops. 
[00:13:30]  You've got to place blame where it is.  You can't call these people animals because they're not.  They're savages.  Animals care if they're young.  These people don't.  All right.  Well, thank you.  All right, keep it up.  Great show.  Thanks, Rob.  Keith from Jersey, I'm black, and that fat bastard is no leader.  Stop saying that.  James from Queens.  Guys, not all black people like Reverend Al.  A lot of those coming in, so.  I understand.  I didn't see Rick grabbing some boobage at the parade.  Buttnut from Jersey.  Stop the borings. 
[00:14:00]  I'm trying to take notes from the teacher.  Ha, ha, ha.  I just got it.  White shorts.  Ha, ha, ha.  Just want to let you know that Ben Stein has a live chat tonight at 8 on CommonSession.com.  There we go.  It's going to be an interesting day around here.  Yes.  It's Timmy checking in for Belmore.  Four hours plus until I make Ben Stein cry on ComedyCentral.com.  Alert the troops.  Very nice.  Let's take a quick break here, Anthony.  All right.  Just want to remind people that we are giving out WOW stickers once again today. 
[00:14:30]  The WOW promotion going along very, very nicely.  Yes.  I hope there will be some WOWing on the way home today to make up for yesterday's miserable weather.  Remember, it's Whip-Em-Out whenever.  We just concentrate on it on Wednesdays.  WOW stickers.  Get them today starting at 4 at Ramsey Outdoor.  That's Route 17 North in Paramus, New Jersey.  We're looking for a very huge crowd to show up there and have some fun this afternoon.  I promise there will not be any wilding at one of our promotions, okay? 
[00:15:00]  Our listeners are not savages.  No wilding.  They do like to have fun, though, okay?  Yes.  All right.  We'll be back.  OB and Anthony, 102.7.  WNEW.  Today.  Yes.  Talking about Dr. Philotoff and Diamond Vision again.  There's no need to wear glasses or contacts anymore.  There's a cure.  There's a cure for God's sake.

[00:15:30]  What else can I tell you?  I've done the research for everyone.  Modern miracle.  Dr. Philotoff recently awarded the Visex Star Award.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Yes.

[00:16:00]  Give them a call.  Diamond Vision, 1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020.  Diamond Vision makes Laser Vision Correction affordable.  Financing available for as little as $2 a day, Anthony.  Wow.  1-800-984-2020.  I'm just f***ing around.  Here we go.  O.P.  Anthony.  Our genius gets lost.  You're the crap.  I'm going to cut the crap on this end, I can tell you that. 
[00:16:30]  1-0-2-7-W-M-E-W.  What do you got, Anthony?  I got an email.  Mike McQueen.  Guys, the show is fun, but can you please not call blacks animals?  Thank you.  Twist it around.  Twist around our words.  No one here is calling black people animals.  What I was saying was a group of people will get together, 20 or 30 or so people, 
[00:17:00]  and start ravaging women in public, in the park, and on city streets,  ripping their clothes off, and sticking their hands in them,  and groping their breasts, and, yeah, digitally...  Raping them.  Raping them.  Excuse me, how should I speak about them?  How should I speak about those people?  Those nice people?  No, they are animals. 
[00:17:30]  Animals.  Beasts.  Savage people that should not be in a civilized society.  I don't care if they're friggin' green, a purple, a pink, with polka dots.  They are animals.  That's all.  I'm not calling black people animals.  If you want to look at the picture and say,  hmm, the whole group of people doing this are people of color.  What am I supposed to say? 
[00:18:00]  I'm not basing it on their color.  I'm basing it on the fact that they're acting like uncivilized, savage animals.  There you go.  There you go, Mike.  Denise.  Hi.  Hi.  I just wanted to say for our female listeners out there that we really are pleasantly surprised  by your guys' attitude.  I mean, I was scared to listen to your show for the next few days, thinking about how you  would treat and stuff like that, but I think I can't...  We're out of our minds, but we understand the difference between right and wrong. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, barely.  Right, right.  I don't think any woman should be digitally raped in public by a group of people.  Well...  I mean, to let you know, I know what it's like.  Right.  So I was really scared to listen to you guys, but I'm completely pleasantly surprised.  What were you...  What did you think we were going to do?  I thought you were going to make it light and say, like, you know, what's wrong with  you guys having some flowers?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  None at all.  As if it was some kind of joke that was taken out of hand or something.  The only joke I said was I would love to see the fun bags of the black lady that came 
[00:19:00]  forward that Trevor Now was parading around.  Well, yeah, let's just to see if it's true or not.  Because she has huge cans, you know.  Oh, haven't you guys seen enough of that?  No.  Guys love boobs.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, well, I don't want to make it long and boring, but thanks, guys.  All right, Denise.  Bye.  Bye.  Wow, we're not that bad.  I mean, we're bad, but...  Jesus.  Man.  We've got to get through a couple more of these calls, and we'll move on to other things, 
[00:19:30]  okay?  There's a couple of black people, I guess, on the instant feedback, very angry, calling  us a racist faggot.  You know something?  Before you have to worry about Opie and I, look at yourself, please, okay?  Fix your own house first.  Then worry about us.  Okay?  George, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Good.  I can't believe these people are calling you guys racist. 
[00:20:00]  What did you guys do?  Give me a break.  First off, if anyone's racist, it's that fake Sharpton, okay?  Because if he wasn't, he'd be going after the criminals.  Instead, he's turning around and blaming the cops.  I mean, give me a break.  If these were a group of white guys that grow black females, forget about it.  He'd be suing each one of them for $10 million.  Absolutely.  You know, and it's ridiculous.  And why are people calling us racist?  Because we're two white guys saying this?  I guarantee there's a bunch of people...  There's a bunch of people of color that feel exactly how Amna and I feel today. 
[00:20:30]  It was disgusting.  You know, you get a black guy or a Puerto Rican guy that just wants to go to his job every day  and works hard and supports his family.  And I think they're probably more pissed off than white people.  Exactly.  Because it makes it harder for them to just live a normal life like people would want to live in this country.  You know?  Like a civilized human being. 
[00:21:00]  And it just makes it harder for them.  Yeah, and unfortunately, you know, you get the people like that that cause the stereotypes, you know,  that the true racists have.  Guys like you and me, we're not racists.  We're just pointing out facts.  We're stating statistics.  Yeah.  You know, there's happened to be a group of black men that did this.  We're not saying all black men do this.  We're just saying this particular group is the one that did it.  They act like animals.  They should be, you know, dealt with.  Not the cops.  All right, George.  I'm good.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  More from angry black people on the instant feedback. 
[00:21:30]  The person calling themselves angry black from the Bronx.  More dumbass white propaganda.  Well, however you want to say it.  And, oh, that Jeffrey Dahmer ate people.  He wasn't an animal.  Did you hear what I just said?  Yes, Jeffrey Dahmer, animal.  Friggin' animal.  I'm glad he got his head caved in in prison.  The kids at Columbine.  Animals.  We're just talking about this incident.  Now we're talking about this incident.  Right.  And, yes, they are all animals. 
[00:22:00]  Not worthy of living in a civilized society.  There you go.  Have there been white people that have been labeled as animals in our history, in our recent history?  Of course.  But that's not what we're talking about today.  This instance.  That's what's going on today.  Unbelievable.  They try to twist it around.  Ruth, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to call and say that I'm a white woman who lives in Manhattan.  And every single day I walk down the streets, I get nothing but harassment from black men. 
[00:22:30]  And I just think that for the last three years, it's just getting worse and worse.  Like, everyone I know, I have guys coming up to me, grabbing me on the street for no apparent reason.  I'm just minding my own business.  I have guys walking up to me, asking if they can grab certain parts of my body.  That's wonderful, isn't it?  It's great, you know?  And it's like I have to feel threatened to walk down the streets in New York City now.  Because it's like I can't even walk down the street around my own neighborhood. 
[00:23:00]  It's just going to get worse.  It is.  This year is the worst I've ever seen it.  Because the cops, the cops, they've got their hands tied behind their back.  They've got to make themselves look good in front of all the minority leaders.  And they're just going to back off as far as crime goes.  You watch.  You watch.  It's going to be so much fun, this city.  Anywhere you go, even if you go to a dance club, there's just nothing but groping on the dance floor.  And girls don't do anything about it.  They just get pissed, walk away.  Some girls even like it.  Well, that's the ecstasy. 
[00:23:30]  It's unbelievable, though.  It's really unbelievable.  All right, Ruth.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Howard Safer checking in, Anthony.  Hey, Ant, thanks for the support.  Your PBA cards are on the way.  Angry white man checking in.  Please don't refer to Jeffrey Dahmer as an animal.  Jesus.  I'm surprised Angry Black has a computer.  Did he steal it?  That's Rob from Queens.  I'm sorry.  Just reading them as they come in. 
[00:24:00]  Eric, what's going on?  You know, guys, call me Vinny's brother.  You know which Vinny I'm talking about, right?  Vinny the racist guy.  But I can't take it anymore.  And feel free to ring the bell whenever you want to.  I can't take these spigs and niggers anymore.  You know?  Call me a...  That's just going to piss people off.  Man.  People do carry it a little... 
[00:24:30]  People do carry it a little far, Opie.  You got to think that somewhere,  John Rocker is smiling and giggling to himself, huh?  Not after last night's performance.  Oh, he just...  Oh, my God.  They put him in for eight balls.  Yeah.  And they were balls.  Yeah.  No, I think six.  Yeah, he threw six pitches last night.  Six to eight pitches and they got him out of there.  But you got to think somewhere behind closed doors,  he's giggling as he's watching the coverage from Central Park on CNN or something.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter, though. 
[00:25:00]  You can't...  I see no solution to this problem.  None whatsoever.  It just will never, ever be resolved.  It's been going on so long,  it's just the way it's always going to be.  It's just going to get worse.  It's a mess.  All right.  We'll take one more call.  We got to move on because we're...  I'm getting all worked up, Opie.  We could do this type of radio,  but we'd rather not.  Rather have some, you know, boobs and fun. 
[00:25:30]  Let the boring folks at ABC have this one.  Sean, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, ONA?  How are you?  Listen, I got your solution.  Yeah.  Martial law.  Yeah, that would be fun.  Yeah, it would be real interesting.  Martial law.  Cool.  Of course.  It wouldn't affect me.  I leave work and I go home.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  We got to get a play out of this little ditty  and we'll be back. 
[00:26:00]  Stay there.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the cool club's clan?  Yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's staffing off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease. 
[00:26:30]  You hear his battle cry?  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan you know you can trust.  The party little reverend with an ass just like a bug.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Remember Bernie Gets and the brawly case? 
[00:27:00]  Turn on the TV.  You would always see his face.  He's feeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  All the never-ending search for some good publicity.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al. 
[00:27:30]  I'm Reverend Al.  He's coming round.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee.  Now as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  That's right.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's a rage, fake, white, hate, bag of baloney.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al. 
[00:28:00]  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  There's a good example of four programs.  1027 WNEW.  Reverend Al.  Stack of two.  The world's strongest fat burner.  I need stack of two.  Wait, I need stack of ten.  Lose the weight with stack of two.  Yeah.  You think I need that? 
[00:28:30]  To keep my boyish figure?  You look hungry.  I keep some in my locket around my neck.  Look like a big hubcap medallion.  Yeah.  Volkswagen hubcap.  Yeah.  It's full of stack of two.  I got to pop them every five minutes so I don't explode.  Reverend Al.  You look hungry.  I'm starving.  For some attention.  That's it.  Hungry for attention.  It's been a whole day without seeing you on TV.  Hey, my psychiatrist said I swallowed a lot of aggression as a child, along with a lot 
[00:29:00]  of pepperoni pizza.  That old gag.  I was going to say, that old gag, yeah.  Thank you, John Candy.  Stagger, too.  What's the number?  1-800-WHITE-WINE.  No, Light Line.  Oh, Light Line.  1-800-LIGHT-WINE.  I thought the people at Stagger were being racially biased.  No, no, no, no.  But does it lose weight on black people?  Yes, it does.  Very good.  Better than that crack stuff.  Better than crack. 
[00:29:30]  All right, that was a joke.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I went a little too far.  I apologize to you and your people, Reverend Al.  I'm really sorry.  Reverend Al.  That's been a crack.  Reverend Al.  1-800-LIGHT-LINE for Stagger 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Or visit their website, www.stagger2.com.  Stagger 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Our listeners have proven it works.  While you're listening to O&A, I'm out throwing chicken wings at people. 
[00:30:00]  This is Jim Briller.  Take that up, you stinker.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Back off!  That's a good chicken wing.  Remember the chicken wing thing?  Yeah.  I want to remind people that Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy, will be handing out the WoW stickers once again for us today.  We really appreciate the help he's given us for the show lately.  He's going to be at Ramsey Outdoor.  That's Route 17 north of Brems, New Jersey.  He shouldn't be there by 4.  Get down there.  It's always a good time at these WoW sticker stops, okay? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  All right, let's go to the phones.  We want to try to move on to other things here, gang.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  How are you?  All right, man.  Listen, I also think the solution is kind of simple.  If people would stop standing around when they see stuff go down,  then maybe other people might think twice before they think they could do something and get away with it.  What do you mean?  You know what I'm saying?  If you see somebody getting mugged next to you, then just watch them.  How many times do you hear about that?  Somebody gets beat up or somebody gets raped. 
[00:31:00]  Everyone, it's New York.  Millions and millions of people.  No one does anything.  I would like to think I would jump in.  Oh, please.  I'm not going to sit here and act like I'm brave or anything.  No, I understand what you mean.  But if enough people got together and said, listen.  In the back of your head, you're like, yeah, I would jump in.  But, I mean, when you're in that situation, 9 out of 10, no way.  We're all freaking scared.  No way.  You get your head handed to you.  You would get your head handed to you.  Forget it.  I don't know, man.  I think...  Did you see the video?  Yeah, I've seen the video.  Did you see where some guys were trying to kind of, like, control the situation? 
[00:31:30]  Hey, stop that.  Stop that.  You.  They were getting abused themselves.  No, I hear what you're saying, man.  It sounds all good on paper, you know, but I just...  The average person just doesn't jump in when it's that crazy.  Until they allow law-abiding citizens to walk around with guns.  Well, there you go.  Now, everybody had a gun.  You could just all of a sudden...  There you go.  Just shoot them all.  Whip out your pieces.  That's it.  Imagine that.  A few people all of a sudden just...  That would be great.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:32:00]  Mary has to put the boobs away.  There you go.  Ain't going to happen.  All right, Rich.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Jesus.  Just going through some instant feedback.  Hey, ONA, doesn't Reverend Al remind you of the witch doctor in the Bugs Bunny cartoons?  That's just wrong, man.  Rob from Brooklyn.  Syndication when Al Sharpton tries a stacker, too.  Yeah.  Ain't going to happen.  I want to say hi to Conan O'Brien. 
[00:32:30]  I guess he's a listener of our radio show, Anthony.  Oh, I read that.  Yeah.  You got a new character on this show?  We're getting a ton of email on this.  Keith from Massapequa writes,  Anybody see Conan last night?  He was introducing new characters for his show,  and one of them was called Camel Toe Annie.  She came out and danced around with a huge, prosthetic, Celine-like camel toe in her pants.  That's pretty funny.  It was effing hysterical. 
[00:33:00]  I wish I saw that.  You got to give it to Conan, man.  That show, he can't interview worth a crap,  but at the beginning of the show with all the skits he does and stuff,  his skits are great.  They're really funny, man.  His skits are great.  They're so out there.  His skits are so much better than Letterman's and Leno's.  Yeah.  You know, but I don't think we could take credit for the camel toe thing.  No, no.  I think guys have been saying, you know,  it looks like she's got a camel toe in the front of her pants for many, many years,  way before we were on New York radio.  Yeah.  It's like just a word people have been using. 
[00:33:30]  That's pretty funny, though.  A lot of people have their own version of that.  It looks like she's got a yo-yo in the front of her pants.  It looks like she's smuggling a midget's catcher's mitt in the front of her pants.  Moose knuckle.  Moose knuckle.  The cloven moose knuckle.  Moose knuckle.  Very good.  And also, we want to congratulate, what's this guy's name?  Milo Yambag.  Milo Yambag?  Milo Yambag from Point Pleasant. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  This guy, he's a really, really good runner.  He runs all these road races in Jersey.  Yeah.  And he's always making the local paper with just ridiculous names that have something  to do with our radio show.  Yeah.  And Milo Yambag came in third place overall, Anthony.  All right.  Milo Yambag.  In the Three Mile Beach Run, June 10th.  Part of the Jersey Shore Running Club.  What paper was this in?  Because everyone should check it out.  I don't even know.  They didn't know.  Whatever.  It's just the race results.  It says, ONA, the soldiers of the ONA Army run again. 
[00:34:30]  Mr. Yambag, that's Milo Yambag.  It's the Asbury Park Press again.  Oh, it's Asbury Park Press.  Okay.  He took third place overall in the Jersey Shore Running Club, three miles in Deep Sand Run.  I'm over here now.  Milo.  Congratulations, Milo.  Milo Yambag.  Good job.  Very good.  You ever see on Conan the Masturbating Bear skit?  No.  God damn, that's pretty funny, too.  They bring a bear out on stage and they have to keep his arms away from his crotch because 
[00:35:00]  he plays himself.  And the guy talks about it and stuff.  And then all of a sudden, by the end of the bed, the bear gets his hands free and just  starts jerking it.  Yeah.  And people are horrifying.  I don't think the show's going to be as good without Andy.  Yeah, what's he doing?  That's a dumb move.  There's just some...  They've just got a great chemistry.  Yeah.  And a lot of these guys that leave a successful show to try to make it in Hollywood just bomb  miserably.  Yeah.  I don't know how responsible Andy is for the writing and stuff. 
[00:35:30]  I think he writes a lot of that stuff.  Do you?  Everyone knows Conan's a great comedy writer.  Yeah.  You know, it's very funny.  Some of the best seasons of The Simpsons, it was, you know...  Yeah, he was writing.  Yeah, Conan's responsible for all that.  I don't know what Andy's going to do.  Where's he going?  He's going to...  Like, that's a dopey-ass move.  What a good gig you got there.  He's going to make it in Hollywood.  Like everyone else.  He...  Ooh.  Could get ugly.  Hmm. 
[00:36:00]  All right, Ed.  I think...  Read instant feedback.  And what?  I don't know.  People...  It doesn't matter what you say on this show.  People are just going to get pissed off at it.  What do we do now?  Just the black-white thing.  I don't want to go back into it.  That we're hypocrites.  Why are we hypocrites?  With the animal thing.  I can't...  I can't...  We didn't call black people animals.  We said the people that did the crap in the park are animals.  I don't care what color they are.  Doesn't matter.  All right.  Make sure you don't put a black girl in the 55-gallon drum tomorrow. 
[00:36:30]  Reverend Al will sue the both of you.  Ooh, speaking of which, that's going to be great tomorrow.  I think we're all set.  Actually, we're waiting for the barrel guy to call us back.  We're getting a little nervous.  We've paged you.  Mm-hmm.  If you don't know what's going on, tomorrow's the 55-gallon drum challenge on the show.  We have five ladies coming down, Anthony.  We got huge barrels.  Yeah.  And they got to stay in the barrels from 2 to 7 o'clock.  We're giving out a ton of money for the lady who survives all the way to 7. 
[00:37:00]  If they all survive until 7, I highly doubt that, then they'll split the cash price.  Mm-hmm.  It's a big cash price.  A lot of cash.  And basically, we're just going to be constantly dumping stuff into the barrel to make the girls' lives a living hell for five hours.  Five hours in a barrel with disgusting stuff being poured on them.  Last one in the barrel wins the entire thing.  I don't want to give everything away, but there will be chum tomorrow. 
[00:37:30]  Chum.  Chum will be spilled into the barrel.  I mean, these girls are sick.  You know, you go fishing.  To go for this.  You get their fish guts and all kinds of stuff.  Chum.  Chum.  Mm-hmm.  And the boys went shopping, and there's just a ton of stuff that will end up in the barrel with the ladies.  Yeah.  It's going to be pretty incredible.  We're going to be all over the WDW website tomorrow with pictures.  Plenty of pictures.  As the show's going on.  And believe it or not, Ant and I will be starting at 2 tomorrow. 
[00:38:00]  2?  2?  Come on.  We'll be on at 2.  Really?  Yes.  So we've got to get the festivities going early.  I'd better get in a little early.  Well, that's why I bring this up on the air.  If you can make it in by 2.  I'd better get in a little earlier tomorrow.  If you can make it in by 2, that would be really good.  Is that the latest?  I greatly appreciate it.  Is that the latest?  Do you like goof going around the office and everything that I come tooling in late every day?  No, not really.  No?  No.  You've got hell on earth when you're not at the radio station.  I sure hope so. 
[00:38:30]  I'd hate to be goofed on.  I'm not here.  No, I'm just clearing my throat.  Okay.  So I believe we're all set.  And I think we're going to allow the listeners to come down with stuff to throw in the barrel, Anthony.  Stuff?  Yeah, whatever they want.  Their junk?  I mean, we've got to make sure.  We'll have someone checking what you brought down to throw in the barrel with the girls.  Make sure it's not like hydrochloric acid.  No, no, no.  Look at her boil. 
[00:39:00]  No, none of that crap.  No.  You know, you show up at the station while this is going on.  If you've got something legit that we could use in the barrels, we will invite you down  to pour it on the girls and then get the hell out of here.  Right.  And let us do our damn radio show, okay?  Mm-hmm.  But it's shaping up to be an unbelievable show tomorrow.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Let's check in with Jeff Norris real fast here.  Gorilla Boy!  Jeff!  Oh!  Is he there?  I think he wasn't answering because of, that's kind of racist, calling him Gorilla Boy. 
[00:39:30]  Jeff Norris!  Oh, wait, he's white.  Jeff?  Isn't that insane?  See if Jeff's there on line five.  Gorilla Boy's at Ramsey Outdoor, Route 17 North in Paramus, New Jersey.  Looks like he has arrived.  He's doing another WOW sticker stop for us.  And we'll take a break.  We'll try to talk to him next.  Also, we've got to talk about Survivor, Anthony.  I hope you saw that last night.  I did, finally.  Very good.  You could give your opinions on the show.  The highly rated Survivor.  I enjoyed the show last night. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  We'll get into that next for a little while.  Stay there.  I feel stupid.  Oh, so stupid.  I feel stupid and dumb and dumb.  Opie and Anthony.  We've got a smile on our face and our head up our ass.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah.  212-757-1027 is our phone number today. 
[00:40:30]  We've got to talk about Survivor just a little bit here, Anthony.  The big show was last night on CBS.  I guess you know the deal by now.  You've got these castaways.  Yeah.  Castaways.  And they've got to survive on the island.  Last person that survives wins a million dollars.  Blah, blah, blah.  And last night was the big show where they had to eat rat.  Rat.  It wasn't quite as disgusting on the TV show as it was listening to it on this very program.  Well, that's the difference between us and network TV. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  They sugar-coated the whole rat eating on TV last night.  Yeah.  We gave you all the gory details last Friday on this here radio show.  I want to know who the genius was that made that rat trap.  Did you see that thing?  I did see the rat trap.  That was amazing.  If I was on that island, I would starve to death.  I'd starve.  I'd be eating sand.  Right.  What are you going to eat?  What would you even do?  I made a rat trap out of bamboo and stuff.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even be able to build a shelter.  I'd be pathetic out there, man. 
[00:41:30]  Just in the fetal position, crying on the beach.  Someone rescue me.  I want to go home.  So, Ant, you finally got to see Survivor.  Yes.  You missed the first few weeks.  Yeah.  So you missed BB and Sonya.  Yeah.  The first two that got voted off the island, too.  Voted off the old people.  The old people.  There's only one old person left, Rudy, the ex-Navy SEAL.  I thought he was going to get it last night.  I thought he was getting thrown off.  Let me tell you something.  It just shows how sharp the opester is at times. 
[00:42:00]  What do you mean?  The whole show was about whether Rudy or Stacey were going to be voted off the island.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't like Rudy, I guess.  Like I said, it was the first time I was watching it last night.  And they don't think he's really contributing that much to the...  No, he really isn't.  And even he was saying, I think the younger people are going to vote me off.  Yeah.  She's like the only old one left.  Did anyone else catch when they did the montage for the show?  I think they do it in the beginning or they did it coming back from commercial or something 
[00:42:30]  where they show all the castaways or whatever, you know, these people that are trying to survive  on the island.  Yeah.  They show Rudy with a two to three week growth on his face.  Big beard.  Well, yeah, enough.  Yeah.  I mean, a lot more hair on his face than he had on yesterday's episode.  So I saw the montage.  I'm like, oh, great.  Stacey's being voted off.  There was no doubt in my mind because it's like it's obvious Rudy survives because, you  know, they show him with a, you know, a heavy beard later on in the series.  Yeah.  He wouldn't have been able to grow that in like ten minutes. 
[00:43:00]  It just goes to show you that I don't really have a life that I could let...  You were picking that out.  I mean...  Picking that out in a montage.  But, well, what do you think of the show, first of all?  I thought it was pretty good.  A little hokey when they go to that tribal council.  Yeah, it is hokey.  And it was pouring rain, so I didn't get to see him extinguish the torch.  Oh, that is so dramatic.  It went out already.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, that was kind of cool.  The rat thing, like I said, I think they could have gotten a little more detail.  They cut away right when he was lopping its head off. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And it wasn't as gruesome.  No, not at all.  I think it was more gruesome in here, making it with some kind of sauce and preparing it  than it was just out in the wilderness, sticking it on a stick.  Yeah, I don't think anyone would argue that.  I mean, you heard the rat frying in the pan on our show.  Yeah, yeah.  You heard people puking and the blood and the guts.  It was just disgusting.  Yeah, pretty sick.  We still have those video clips up on foundrymusic.com, by the way.  Yeah.  If you want to see it for yourself.  I haven't even looked.  So it turns out they ate the rat, the one tribe, and they had no problem with it. 
[00:44:00]  They said it tasted pretty good, matter of fact.  Yeah.  I thought they would make some facers or something.  They make the obligatory, it tastes like chicken line.  Right.  Everyone says that.  Right.  And then, yeah, they had their little competition.  They had to rescue one of their tribe's mates from hanging from a tree, put him in like  a homemade stretcher.  That was kind of hokey, huh?  Yeah.  And run him to a shelter.  I'm like, ah, God, that kind of sucked.  Yeah, it was kind of funny. 
[00:44:30]  I heard about some other ones they did, what, last week and the week before that were kind  of cool.  Where they're eating a larva caterpillar thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, this sounded like some kind of wacky road rules adventure thing.  Yeah.  It was pretty much a road rules adventure.  I was hoping it was getting something a little more extreme than that, and taking one of your  little, what are they going to have next?  One of those little sack races?  Are they getting a sack and have to jump down the beach?  And I'm so into the show, I could tell you what's going to happen next.  Without giving anything away.  Okay.  You know, the coming previews and stuff. 
[00:45:00]  I'm on the CBS website.  They have a whole survivor section.  They're going to have to build like an SOS.  I'm frightened.  The two tribes are going to have to build some type of SOS, and there's going to be a plane  flying by with some great supplies for one of the tribes.  Uh-huh.  And whatever SOS signal is better, that tribe will get the goods that they're going to  drop from this plane.  Really?  Wow.  That could be kind of interesting.  All right.  That's kind of cool.  But yesterday, they were fighting for the spear, so they could go spearfishing.  Spearfishing.  Yes. 
[00:45:30]  And then the gay guy got to go spearfishing.  The gay guy.  He is gay, right?  Oh, yeah.  Because I'm watching.  I don't know what from a hole in the wall.  No, last week, they determined that Rich, I think his name's Rich, is gay.  So I didn't see it last week, but I'm watching.  All right.  Now you can appreciate this.  Before you say anything.  Yeah.  Rich, they determined he was gay last week.  Yeah.  Rudy, the ex-Navy SEAL, was the guy, the old guy.  Rubbing lotion.  Was rubbing lotion on gay Rich.  All I know is at one point, they showed Rich last night standing on a rock talking. 
[00:46:00]  Within two seconds, I went, this guy's gay.  This guy's really gay.  And that was Rich, the gay guy.  I'll tell you that one broad is a lesbian.  Yeah, yeah.  When is that coming out?  The girl, she has an accent like she's from Chicago or something.  Yeah.  She's without a doubt gay.  If anyone knows her name, please give it to us on Instant Feedback.  Are you digging any of the chicks yet, Ant? 
[00:46:30]  A lot of people thought that Stacey was the hottest chick, the one they voted off last night.  She was all right, I guess.  You know, I really didn't get to see them because it was really pouring rain and stuff.  Let's cut to the chase.  Yeah.  Colleen?  Yeah.  The student from Florida?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Taking that mud bath and stuff yet last night?  That must have been in the beginning.  I missed the very beginning.  They found a mud hole, like the mud coming up from the ground.  That really cool mud.  Pounded her mud hole what? 
[00:47:00]  Who?  I missed that.  I got to get it in earlier.  And she was just jumping around in the mud with her little tribe mates.  Yeah?  Oh, it was so good.  Naked?  It was great.  They might as well have been naked.  They had so much mud on them.  Yeah.  You know?  No, I didn't get to...  See, I'm still kind of iffy on their names and everything.  Uh, let's go to Keith.  Keith.  Hey, it's Pete.  How you doing?  Oh, Pete.  It says Keith.  Sorry.  Look at that Colleen.  I told you.  Oh, my God.  She is so hot.  Did you tell if she was wearing the bandana around her boots? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I did.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Isn't she...  She's really cute.  You guys got to get her on the show.  I was thinking to use our pole in some way and get her on the show.  You got to get her on the show.  Pole.  What pole?  Right.  We don't have pole.  We don't have pole.  They'll get a son on you knowing us.  Yeah, right.  The old brother got kicked off a couple weeks ago.  First, yeah.  Yeah.  Are you digging Survivor, Keith?  Oh, absolutely.  Cool.  Yeah, I was actually in AC last night, and I came up from the gambling casino to watch  the show. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, you were losing, huh?  Well, yeah.  It's very addicting, because after a few more weeks, you're really going to fall for some  of these characters and hope they don't get voted off the island, you know?  Yeah.  Right now, it's like a no-brainer.  Everyone knows Rudy pretty much will go soon.  Rudy just looks like a miserable old bastard.  Yeah, the black lady, Ramona, it looks like she's going to be voted off soon.  Probably.  You know?  How about that doctor, though?  He's some kind of neurosurgeon or something.  Yeah.  I don't know where he's going to be. 
[00:48:30]  No, he's going to survive for a little while.  I think they're going to get rid of that religious freak.  What's his name?  Dirk?  Dirk or something like that?  Dirk, yeah.  I think they're going to get rid of him soon, too.  Yeah.  All right, Keith.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Phil.  Phil, you're next on N.E.W.  How are you?  Phil?  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  You're on the radio.  Let's go, Phil.  Yeah, it's Phil.  How are you doing?  I know.  Goodbye.  Dave, you're next on N.E.W.  How are you?  Dave? 
[00:49:00]  Dave?  Yes, how are you doing?  God, these phones could really help a radio show, and it could just completely wreck the  energy.  They're bad today.  It's okay.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, well, I was wondering, where did they get the rain gear and the chicken wire and all  this stuff from last night?  I know.  I thought they were supposed to be on the island with pretty much nothing.  They're supposed to have two bags of rice apiece and some chop sticks.  They come up with the rain gear.  Yeah, and they have chicken wire to make that little stretcher out of it.  I think he's going to be able to spear fish when there's like a whole camera crew underneath  the water. 
[00:49:30]  The fish are just waiting around for him.  That's a good point.  No, I don't know.  I think, I don't know.  Something, it doesn't seem right.  Yeah, the rain slickers was like, come on.  Yes.  The show's called Survivor.  Yeah, I know.  And then they're walking to the tribal council spot with their torches.  Yeah, and then they get to stay there all night.  And all of a sudden, they walk up, they're coming up the stairs, and you notice that there's  more light being thrown by huge floodlights than just torches.  The whole place is lit up. 
[00:50:00]  They do a lot of production on that show, I noticed.  A lot more than I thought they were going to do.  One of your tribesmates was in a plane crash.  Here's the plane, and they have like an old piece of a decrepit plane.  And the guy does ham it up, the host.  Jeff?  Yeah, he really hams it up a little, is a little much.  We had him on the show two weeks ago.  We've got to get him on again.  Bob, what's up?  It's your immunity. 
[00:50:30]  What is it?  Tiki.  Tiki.  Your immunity, Tiki, is over there.  Oh, shut up.  Hey, Bob.  Can't you just write it down that we were the ones?  Right.  He had an immunity, Tiki.  Bob, let's go.  What's up?  Let's go.  Hey, hi.  What's up?  I went to school with that Richard dude, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, we were, I never knew he was gay.  He was always kind of, you know, strange, you know.  My, a friend of my wife, she's like, yeah, he's got issues.  But we never knew he was gay.  I didn't know he was gay until I just heard you guys talking about it. 
[00:51:00]  And finally, I watched the show last night.  I see this fat ass running around, running around.  He's so happy to get his snorkel and spin.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to show you guys what I'm going to do.  Yeah.  You know, it's just kind of funny to see him there, you know.  Yeah.  But, yeah, we went to high school together.  I saw him at our reunion, and he told me he was going for that thing.  It was fun, you know.  And then he went home, and when he got home, he, like, you are gay.  Mike, you're next on N.E.W. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, did you notice, Stacey, when she found out she got voted off, I think she turned to  the diesel bike and said something like, you changed your vote?  She goes, oh, you changed your vote, and walks off all pissed off.  Well, people are going to start getting pissed off now.  Yeah.  Yeah, then at the end of the show, when they had that last little bit with her, she's  like, oh, I shouldn't have been voted off.  I was so great.  No, she was the weak link.  That's why she was picked for that slug challenge, you know, the caterpillar larva challenge thing. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I missed that.  Because she was saying, hey, you know, let's not forget I won that competition.  Well, the only reason the other team picked her, because she was the weak link.  Yeah, I actually missed that one.  Yeah.  All right, Mike, thank you.  All right, syndication went off.  Went off.  Oh, that syndication thing might be played out by now, huh?  It was so played out.  It would have to be so clever and something we totally haven't heard up to this point to 
[00:52:30]  be even remotely funny anymore.  Let's go back to you suck or something.  Yeah, I mean, enough.  Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, I think my man, Gay Richard, was a champ last night.  And that black girl, didn't want to eat the rat.  She said, as poor as we get, we never eat rats.  And she took a bite.  She said, give me some more rats.  As poor as we get in the, what, in the ghetto?  Yeah, wherever. 
[00:53:00]  We never eat rats.  Yeah.  I just want to say, next week at the gay parade, you will never see any guys groping women.  Well, it goes without saying.  And.  Yeah, did you have to say that?  And syndication, when a wild stick is found in a mummy's tomb.  All right.  Thank you.  Wow.  Oh, damn.  Okay.  Enough with the syndication thing.  Oh, if I may, the second we hear syndication.  Just hang up. 
[00:53:30]  Come on.  I want to make a look.  Just hang up.  Hang up.  All right.  Justin, what's going on?  Yeah, I'd like to get rid of the monster.  That's a fun.  You know what it is?  It's those rays from the sun.  They're screwing up my cable, too.  I was trying to watch Discovery last night, and it kept petering out on me.  I was pissed.  The sun.  The sunspot thing.  The sunspot thing.  Big solar flares are screwing up our electric.  It's too bad, because we really need the phones for this segment.  Get people's opinions on Survivor. 
[00:54:00]  Brian, you're next on N.E.W.  Dude, Survivor is nothing but some yuppie five years ago, finally saw a rerun of The Real  World and Road Rules, and was like, oh, let's do this for CBS.  Dude, it's such a copy, man.  Well, that's so true.  I mean, it's like five years behind.  They don't even try to hide that fact, you know?  Yeah.  They just had their own spin on it.  But it's like I'm trying to watch it for like five minutes.  I'm like, okay, I saw this in 1995 when The Real World in New York was on. 
[00:54:30]  I'm like, I can't watch that.  Hey, Anthony, you got a little something-something yet?  What?  Syndication, when you get a little something-something.  Oh, see, he said it first, and then he said syndication.  Yeah, I'm back from Bay Ridge.  Hey, douche nozzles, what happens at the end when there are only two people left?  Do the viewers get to vote?  Can the officer clear this up?  No, what happens is they, when it's down to two, I believe, they bring back all the people  that were voted off the island, and then they decide between the two that are left. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  Am I good or what?  I love this show.  How are they going to do that?  That's a little weird.  I guess they'll make them watch all the episodes and stuff, because if you're voted off the  first week, you have no freaking clue what went on the island in the last, you know,  10, 12 weeks.  You'd have to watch, and then if the person that voted you off,  is last, you'd have to vote against them.  Yeah.  You know, one person that voted you off.  But you don't know for sure, oh, I guess you would know for sure who voted you off. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, you watch, and they kind of show you.  Right.  So, you know, I was voted off, and they were one of the people that were left at the end,  I would, you are gone.  Hey, Chris, you're next on N.E.W., how are you?  Chris?  Did you say Chris?  Yo.  Yo, what's up, buddy?  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Hey, so I was, what are the girls on the island doing when they get their period?  I mean, is that why the chick was in the mud bath, maybe?  And, I don't know, maybe Anthony might think, do you think Anthony thinks anyone's wearing 
[00:56:00]  white shorts on the island?  Very funny.  Crickets.  I want crickets.  He wants crickets.  Yeah, enough crickets yesterday, believe me.  Yeah, the mud was the highlight of the show yesterday.  There are crabs all over the place.  Why can't they eat those?  Were there crabs?  Have you seen crabs so far on the show?  I'm trying to remember.  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  Maybe there's not enough protein in the crabs? 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  They're not bringing everyone back, just the last seven people who were voted off.  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  I thought it was all of them.  What's up with the fish, though?  There's no fish in the area.  No fish?  None whatsoever.  Yeah, how does that happen?  It's a tropical island.  You would assume there's just fish everywhere.  Didn't one guy catch fish, though?  Yeah, Gay Rich was catching the dam.  Yeah.  Stingrays.  Who would eat a stingray?  Hey, people eat those.  It's good eating, Opie.  You cut them wings off?  Mmm.  Oh, great.  Thanks for telling me who the last four people are on the whole show. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, did somebody just screw it for you?  Greatly appreciated.  Thank you.  Oh.  Thank you.  I was waiting for that to happen, because the show is already over.  Thank you, though.  Appreciate it.  I didn't think he would survive that long.  Yeah, they're doing casting call now for Survivor 2. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  What do you think?  You putting in your application?  My brother wants to.  He's pissed at me.  Really?  My brother's pissed at me, because officially we work for CBS, and he thinks he's going to  get picked for Survivor.  And he literally called me pissed.  Probably can't.  Like, I had an application, you know, because he spent time in Guam going to school, so he  assumes he's good enough for Survivor.  And he's really pissed at me, because, you know, family and friends of CBS can't apply.  Oh.  I swear to God.  I should have brought that up weeks ago.  He's truly pissed.  They'll probably do it somewhere different next time. 
[00:58:00]  Like, they'll take him to Asia, Southeast Asia or something.  Put him in some Vietnam POW camp.  Take him to Uganda.  Yeah.  Take him there.  That's surviving.  Botswana.  Rhodesia.  Let's go to Rick on Line 7.  Rick, you're next on N.E.W.  Yes, O.N.A.  How are you?  Regarding the two Negroes on the show?  Ramona and I forgot the other guy.  Yeah, Joe, the guy with the YMCA.  Oh, yeah.  Right. 
[00:58:30]  By the way, how the hell do you make money working at the YMCA?  But anyway, that's another point.  How the hell do you get two blacks, stereotypically, who can't swim on this island?  Well, it looks like they...  Where's their jungle instinct?  Oh, Jesus.  It always comes down to that.  We're doomed as a nation, people.  It did look like they couldn't swim, though.  They had, like, inner tubes.  Did you see the challenge yesterday?  The inner tubes.  What a sick challenge.  They had to move, what, uh...  Water wings.  They had to move, like, a treasure chest. 
[00:59:00]  Where are my swimmies?  They had to have swimmies.  How are they ever...  Swimmies!  That alone is going to make people vote them off the island.  Yeah.  It's like we're...  You can't swim.  We're surrounded by water and you can't swim?  Swimmies.  Well, you could delve right into this stereotype if you want to, but...  Jose, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, man?  Um, this show is so fake.  I mean, come on.  Can you really believe that there's, like, the producers and production agency and, you  know, camera guys all on the island and stuff? 
[00:59:30]  I mean, really.  What?  Some back lot somewhere.  Oh, back lot.  I mean, come on.  You think the show's not on an island?  I really don't think...  Maybe it's on an island, but, you know, they're not living there, like, totally, like, in,  you know, some kind of, you know, sick, warped, you know, real-world episode or anything.  I don't know.  I think they're sleeping under their shelter and stuff.  I don't think so, dude.  They do throw them, like, the rain slickers and stuff when it starts raining, which is kind  of stupid, but...  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think it's kind of dull.  I think it's all fake, man.  Seriously.  I don't know. 
[01:00:00]  Maybe it's just me.  I don't know.  All right.  Thanks.  Mr. Conspiracy Theory.  I think that guy wishes Rich would work his spear.  I think it's fake.  Birthday.  Yeah.  Butts.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sock him.  Sock him.  Yeah.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, O&A?  Oh, yeah.  Listen.  Yo. 
[01:00:30]  I don't understand.  I think this show, I'm with the last part.  This show is definitely staged.  It's fake.  I just don't understand how anybody can watch this stuff.  I have better things to do on Whiphamout Wednesday night than to watch this stupid show.  What do you do?  That is totally, I'll go out and do whatever rather than sit home at summertime and sit  home and watch, ooh, Survivor.  Oh, I agree with you.  It's like, people tell me they watch because it's like the suspense.  I'm like, oh, it's suspense.  Like, Regis, who wants to be a millionaire, who wants to be a survivor, who wants to be 
[01:01:00]  phoned off the island.  That show's about done.  Millionaire.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  I like the show.  It's original.  Everything else is in repeat.  Yeah, but how do you buy into this theory that the show is real?  It's definitely real to a point.  It's as real as they can make it.  Listen, I got to think that the producers or there's some writers are telling these actors  or whatever you want to call them, you know, what kind of situations to get themselves into.  You know, like a storyline. 
[01:01:30]  I think that there has to be some kind of storyline that's created.  Please.  Well, they're definitely, you know, influencing the story as it goes and stuff, but I don't  know.  It's fun.  I'm enjoying it.  I'm not taking it for serious TV or anything.  Listen, Ope, it's summertime.  You got to have better things to do on Wednesday night than to sit around and watch Survivor.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it, Chris.  I do nothing except sit around and watch Survivor.  You're right.  No, no.  Seriously, I'm not anything towards you, but, you know.  The fact is I rarely watch TV. 
[01:02:00]  Rarely.  All right.  I can't stand sitcoms.  I don't watch.  I barely watch TV.  This show, I'm definitely hooked on.  I'm digging it.  And what can I tell you?  And then I watched Reggie Miller blow it last night.  Oh, I hate Reggie Miller.  I had a great night last night.  I had a great night.  Reggie Miller.  I'm a diehard Knicks fan.  I put on my Kobe Bryant jersey as soon as the Pacers won the series.  I hate Reggie Miller.  He missed it at the buzzer last night.  I was jumping up and down.  I was screaming.  I was so damn happy. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, definitely.  I'm with you, Ope.  Let's go.  Let's go, Lakers.  So now you're with us.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Listen, that show sucks and you guys suck.  Peace.  Bye.  Thank you.  All right.  We got to end our little discussion on this.  Mike, what's up?  What's up?  This is Mike from Jersey.  Yeah, Mike.  I saw that Stacy chick on the early show this morning.  Uh-huh.  From Survivor.  She's pretty hot.  She's hot when she's all dressed up and everything.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's pretty hot.  She didn't look that hot on the island.  Colony?  No, well. 
[01:03:00]  Hot on that island.  What a difference, though.  And she also mentioned she had a boyfriend.  Who was the one being carried in the stretcher?  I think her name is Colleen.  Was that Colleen?  Colleen was one of them.  She's real hot.  Like she was in her little bikini thing with the hair like here.  She wore her hair and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  That chick Stacy was saying that she knew all along, well, she thought she knew all along  that that chick Susan that voted her off was on her side.  Yeah.  She kept saying, you know, we were in together and, you know.  That's why when she said that, she turned to that one girl and said, oh, you changed your 
[01:03:30]  vote.  Right, right, right.  She said that she was saying it to that girl, Kelly.  Right.  But she was aiming at it.  It was about Susan, but she was saying it to that chick, Kelly, so that she could beware,  you know.  Well, they were trying to, you know, gang together to get Rudy off the island, and it  turned out that it was obvious that, you know, they changed their vote.  Right.  That's what she meant.  She was trying to warn Kelly that, you know, you're next.  Right.  If you don't, you know, if you don't watch out.  Right.  That chick Susan, the dyke is going to get you. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  Because I think, you know, I'm surprised she voted the chick off because you would figure  she'd want the girls on there, would her?  Nah, Stacy was a weak link there, let's face it.  Yeah, but she's good for the viewers.  Yeah.  Not as good as Colleen.  I'm praying that she'd last a few days.  Well, she better last a little while longer.  When she was in the mud and stuff, man, I was like, whoa.  They got to do that mud thing a couple of times.  I think we need to do a mud thing on our show very soon.  You're going to get that chick on there, huh?  I'll just get chicks and more, and mud.  Chicks and mud? 
[01:04:30]  That's not a bad combination.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  You got it.  All right.  Hey, Sheila.  Yeah.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you?  Great.  Hey.  My question is, if there's something to be bathing in the water, why is everybody really  clean-shaven?  You noticed the three girls on the raft last night?  Yeah.  I mean, their legs after nine days would be like hairy bushes.  Yeah, they must have razors or something, huh?  Yeah.  How are they bathing?  They have to go into the woods and get water and stuff for bathing. 
[01:05:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, but all that water is just buried in a little container.  Right.  So it has to be, they have to have like a separate little area that they're going to get  all cleaned up.  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they had some type of area where they tell them, look,  you can shower a little bit and, you know, shave your legs and stuff, because I'm sure  they want them to look pretty for network TV.  It would be better if they didn't do that, though.  Yeah, I agree.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm not taking it for what it is.  I understand there's probably things going on to, yeah, make it work, you know. 
[01:05:30]  I don't think it's fake, though.  Someone wrote, uh, Jamie wrote, uh, from Jersey, yes, a back lot.  It's done on a back lot right next to the set of the moon landing.  Yeah, I was going to say that.  Remember that controversy?  Yeah.  Men didn't land on the moon.  Like, what they did was, uh, have Disney stage it for them, right?  Uh-huh.  And then, in return, the government gave Disney a bunch of land in Florida, which later became 
[01:06:00]  Disney World.  Wow.  Michelle.  Hi.  Hi.  Um, I just started listening to your show yesterday.  Yesterday?  I have to say, you guys are awesome.  Wow.  You caught a real good show.  Wow.  Yeah, with the Sarah Jessica Parker thing.  I know it was Friday.  Cool.  Right.  You guys are hysterical.  Well, we try.  I'm moving out of the area.  I'm really sad.  I'm moving to Boston.  Oh, that's a bastard.  I'm living right in front of Fenway.  Go Shocks!  Go Shocks!  Go Shocks!  Go!  You're going to spend all your time at the clubs on Lansdowne getting tanned?  Oh, hell yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Atlas and all those places.  Atlas.  Yeah.  I like that place.  This place is cool.  You can hear all the games from Fenway from my window.  So, it's going to be pretty cool.  Why are you moving to Boston?  I'm going to BU.  BU?  Yeah.  We're in Masses, so I'm psyched to move.  I'm moving in.  Masses.  I would bet a lot of money you're a Long Island Jewish girl.  Um, is that up?  Yeah.  I can't tell.  The Japs love BU.  The Japs love BU.  Why is that?  No, my boyfriend lives in Boston.  That's another reason why I'm moving.  Yeah, that's cool.  Boston is awesome. 
[01:07:00]  I like that.  The socks suck.  What?  Go, socks.  No love for the socks?  Go, no, ma.  No love for the socks, no.  No, it's more.  We hate it.  Yeah, it is no, it's more.  No, it's more.  No, it's more.  He's got a big nose.  Yeah, he does.  But he makes a lot of money.  All right, Michelle.  Well, have fun and more.  Godspeed to you.  I actually have something to say about Survivor.  Okay.  Okay, I watched it for the first time last night, and it's a joke.  I think, first of all, there's a hotel in Borneo where, like, they're shipped off right 
[01:07:30]  away when they're sent off the show.  Well, yeah.  I mean, if something goes majorly wrong, like, they all stay in a hotel in Borneo.  I think that they're being fed off the cameras.  I think it's totally staged.  Yeah, I'm sure there's stuff going on, you know, behind the cameras.  Yeah, it doesn't have a genuine feeling to it.  Uh-huh.  It's like, um...  I don't know.  Maybe Survivor 2 will be even better, but I've got to say, I'm hooked.  I'm digging the show.  I liked Real World Hawaii.  That was hooking.  Oh, with Rudy, the drunk.  With her and Ruthie and Amaya.  I mean, Ruthie. 
[01:08:00]  I'm sorry, Ruthie.  Yeah, that...  I mean, I think that was a little bit staged, too, but I think that was more addictive  than the Survivor stuff.  Well, yeah, well, what happens with these reality shows, they get, you know, hundreds  of hours of footage, and then they make stories out of it.  That's exactly what they do.  That woman is definitely a lesbian.  Uh, the truck driver?  She's 38, yeah.  She's not old.  I don't know.  She's kind of gruffy.  I think she has talked about her husband on the show, though, but that could be a beard.  Who knows? 
[01:08:30]  Well, maybe she doesn't want to put her sexuality blasted across to the whole world, you know?  Who knows?  That's true.  So, anyway...  Have fun in Boston, Michelle.  Thank you.  Nice talking to you guys.  You, too.  Bye.  Bye.  Don't end up in a dumpster.  Oh!  Oh, a little Boston humor for anyone that was living up there three years ago.  That was a sick story, though, man.  Huh?  Karina.  Karina, yeah.  Found some chick.  Well, half this girl in a dumpster.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Never found the other half.  What did they find, her upper half?  Her upper half in a dumpster and never found the bottom half.  Ouch.  Ouch.  After a night of clubbing.  We'll be doing our little serial killer tribute tomorrow.  Yeah.  But we should get Rick in here and see where we stand on this whole thing.  Yeah.  I mean, we've got to make sure we've got everything set.  All right.  No, we'll take a break and we can do that next.  A cop can prove survivor is crap.  All right.  Hey, Jim, you're next. 
[01:09:30]  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  All right.  Good.  The survivor thing is a lot of crap.  You got this guy.  The next name is Sheila.  He came and laid a fire.  I know.  That's true.  What kind of crap is that, man?  This thing's all staged.  He's older now.  What?  It's easy training.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you, Jim.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Jeff.  He's at the sticker stop at Ramsey Outdoor, Route 17, North Paramus, New Jersey today. 
[01:10:00]  How we doing, fellas?  Hello.  Gorilla Boy, what's going on?  We've got a great crowd out here outside of Ramsey Outdoor on Route 17, right by Circuit City.  Got some guys coming down, giving some pizza from Linwood Pizza in Rochelle Park.  Great crowd right next to where they filmed Sopranos.  And we've got a good crowd here.  All right.

[01:13:30]  Oh.  Oh, man.  I'm sure.  You just wrecked my buzz, dude.  Sorry.  All right.  All right.  Sorry.  I can hear the whole song.  What's going on?  Why not? 
[01:14:00]  How are your stocks doing, man?  What?  What did you say?  How are your stocks doing?  Oh.  You know what I thought?  How about what?  Your stocks?  What?  You like wrecking buzzes, don't you?  What?  My stocks. 
[01:14:30]  We'll start talking about the stock market when it turns around for us.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Boy, it sure turned around for a few people, huh?  Well, I'm glad to say that I'm not part of any of the stocks from that big bus that's going on.  Wow.  Boy, you know, the stock market, amazing.  It can bring all five members, all five crime families together.  All the mob families all came together on this one.  Yeah.  It works as a team.  Isn't that nice?  It's an amazing story. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  It really is.  Yeah.  On the cover of all the papers, USA Today has it.  Mob linked to stock scam.  Turns out the mob sets up this company and starts getting themselves a collection of stock brokers.  They buy up a bunch of stock in these small companies, these little, like, Internet companies, these small caps, they call them, penny stocks. 
[01:15:30]  And they tell all their brokers to sell these things.  Go out, tell your people this is great, it's the next big thing.  A bunch of people invest in it.  And then the mob pulls their money out when the price goes up, gets driven up.  So they make a bunch of money, and then they leave all the other people with the stock price plummeting and screwed.  And in some cases, the trading gets halted on some of the stocks.  Is there a problem here? 
[01:16:00]  Holy Jesus.  How do I get in on this?  Yeah.  It turns out, though, your pal, Anthony, actually owned one of the stocks.  One of the stocks that they're talking about?  We're talking about.  Did he get screwed, or did he have money?  No, because I've said it a million times.  You can't get greedy with these things, especially the penny stocks.  I bought in on Waymex Holdings.  Now I understand the support for the cops. 
[01:16:30]  Why?  It's gotten to this level.  Shut up!  I bought in to Waymex Holdings.  That's one of the stocks?  Yeah, when it was at one and a half.  Dollar and a half.  Dollar fifty a share.  They supposedly...  Yeah, but...  I don't care what they do.  How did you discover that company on your own is what I need to know, Ed.  I've been doing some research on the web.  That's all.  It's supposed to be a company that was going to start up this way to trade online and bypass everybody. 
[01:17:00]  Bypass all the middlemen.  And you're directly trading the stocks.  It's going to be amazing.  Waymex Holdings.  No, not yet.  Mark's looking at me about another stock that I put his brother on to.  Hey, I made money on that one.  You've got to sell eventually.  It looks at me like I'm crazy.  But this Waymex Holdings went from like a dollar a share in December up to twenty bucks a share by February. 
[01:17:30]  And I guess that set off a few red flags.  But I popped out at three.  Bought it in at one and a half.  I popped out at three.  I was not looking because it really wasn't moving fast.  Thanks for the tip, man.  Fast enough.  Appreciate it.  Why?  What, Waymex?  Yeah, thanks.  You didn't want any piece of that.  Thanks.  But now I'm reading the message boards.  It's called a pump and dump. 
[01:18:00]  A pump and dump.  Yeah.  Exactly.  A pump and dump.  You get into these things.  They move a little bit.  You pull out.  You can't live on it.  Like it's going to be the next frigging Microsoft or something.  But the most pathetic thing is you go to the websites like RagingBull.com.  And you read some of the message boards that they have going on these stocks.  The people are so naive, so stupid, so heartbroken, I guess, that they lost, that they can't face the truth. 
[01:18:30]  And this one's ending up just like that ECNC my brother tried to get me into.  Remember that?  That also had its trading halted and they were thrown off of the trading platform.  Well, now I'm reading the Waymix ones and I'm just laughing because it's the same thing.  I called the company and the secretary told me not to worry and we're all in this together and everything's fine.  And you just want to post, what are you, stupid? 
[01:19:00]  What are you, smoking?  You lost your money.  It's gone.  It's gone.  Go on.  I think this stock, they halted trading at like one and a half or give or take a little bit.  When they let them trade again, resume trading, that is going to dump down to 50 cents a share, if that.  And it's hysterical.  The people don't realize it.  It's so sad to read.  You were duped.  It happens. 
[01:19:30]  That's scary with the Internet, too, because you could pump up some of these stocks very easily on those message boards.  That's what they do.  They use message boards.  And when you get corrupt stockbrokers behind it, it's easy because now it's available to so many people, online trading, that they all get excited and jump in.  You've got to jump right the hell back out.  Some of these people dump thousands and thousands into these small cap penny stocks and get effed.  Hey, Rob.  It's hysterical.  Rob's saying he got effed.  Rob.  15 large here, man. 
[01:20:00]  On what?  Company called ePorn.  I bought into the stock.  ePorn?  ePorn.  ePorn.com.  Yeah, they just halted trading on that one.  It's the same story as Waymix.  Hit a brick wall yesterday morning.  Absolutely incredible.  Is this a movie review for the boiler room?  Just like that movie.  Yeah.  So you lost $15,000 on ePorn?  ePorn.  E-A-W-N, yeah.  Oh, Porn.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Yeah, ePorn, not ePorn.  Uh-huh.  I wish it was ePorn. 
[01:20:30]  Maybe we'd make some dollars.  But yeah, I guess it's good.  Yeah.  Jeez.  I took some baths on a couple of those penny stocks.  You know, nothing serious where I'm like, oh my God.  But, you know, it doesn't feel good.  But you definitely learn, man.  You get an education.  You know what you do?  You get sucked into it.  You get sucked into it.  Like, I made a lot of money in it last year.  Yeah.  So you figure, all right, I can make, you know, I can make $30,000 in a couple of weeks.  Right.  I can be a millionaire in a few months.  Yeah, yeah.  See, if I hold on a little longer, that's what it is. 
[01:21:00]  You get so frigging greedy that you don't want to sell.  Hey, it went up.  If I sell and I check back and see this thing went up another couple of points, I'm going  to be pissed that I didn't stay in.  Because then I will have lost that money.  No.  No, you made what you made.  Pull out.  You're doing the math in your head.  Hey, let's bring some friends in.  Give all the good news to your friends.  Let them go down, too.  I read a few of those on the Waymex message board.  Somebody going, I feel bad for myself, but I feel even worse to all the people I talked 
[01:21:30]  to about this stock.  Some of them lost thousands.  We've all been there, though.  It's like playing the slot machines.  You don't know when to stop when you're doing the slot machines, either.  Yeah.  Oh, Christ.  Unbelievable.  It's just an open frigging crap table for anyone with a laptop and an online trading account  at this point.  It's incredible.  Yeah.  All right, Rob.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, you're next on NAW.  Yo.  Mikey.  Hey, I'm right here.  Did you guys see the movie Boiler Room? 
[01:22:00]  It was all about this.  I got to see that.  I haven't rented it yet.  I haven't seen it yet, either.  I'm waiting for it to come out.  Well, I'm going to do what you guys do.  There's one line in them.  They never sell to women.  They say, don't bitch the bitch.  Because if the stock is going down, they're calling every day, driving them crazy.  Yeah.  Because if the stock is going up, they call every hour, driving them crazy.  Don't bitch the bitch.  There's so many emails and messages on these message boards from these people. 
[01:22:30]  They call the company, and they're calling the broker.  They're calling everyone to try to get info.  There's no info.  Read the paper.  There's your info.  The stock was propped up, and it was a pump and dump.  A pump and dump.  A pump and dump.  Alan.  Yeah.  What's up?  I got crushed back in December for a pump and dump.  My brother-in-law belonged to a newsletter that, of course, some guy, some guru of stocks  is sending out there by saying how he had the next Microsoft and all that. 
[01:23:00]  And I was a little wary about it, but I ended up buying about 50,000 shares of it.  Penny stock, about three cents.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, one day, it went up to about $1.25, and amazingly, everything was sold in  about almost not even an hour.  It went down to a penny.  You should have sold.  I lost $27,000 in one hour.  Why didn't you sell?  What happened was is, you know, they were pumped up saying, oh, there's like a few people  that are going to be in on this.  And, you know, you start thinking, hey, maybe I'm willing to sell a few people. 
[01:23:30]  Because I would do a lot.  I would day trade all the time.  Right.  So I figured they got my name off the thing.  And I figured, okay, well, they probably know because I'm a day trader.  So, sure enough, I go ahead and do this, and I didn't put a limit on it, which I always  do.  Especially those stocks.  You've got to put a limit on it.  You know?  And I always did.  I broke my corner rule because I said, okay, you know what?  Because when it opened up in the morning, it was at three cents.  Then it went to 10 cents.  I said, damn, you know, my limit was 15. 
[01:24:00]  Put it up to 25.  And, you know, of course, you're watching the real time.  You're watching it go up.  Yeah.  So all of a sudden, I'm like, damn it, put a market order in.  Before you knew it, within five minutes, 10 million shares were bought.  And I'm like, uh-oh.  And the price of $1.25, I said, I'll be damned if I'm going to get caught.  Sure enough, I started watching the price go from $1.25 down.  And the worst part was the broker at the time wasn't telling me, you know, if the order  went through or not.  Oh, so you didn't even know if the order went through.  Oh, my God.  I said, dude, do me a favor.  Sell it.  He goes, I don't know if you've even done it. 
[01:24:30]  I said, I don't care.  You sell it.  Mark it now.  By the time I got the news back, I got burnt.  And the worst part was I didn't have the money for it.  I had almost all of it.  I actually had, you know, that's a scary feeling.  You have to start calling friends up and say, hey.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It was the worst, man.  Absolute worst.  Thank you, Alan.  Yeah, thanks a lot, man.  Have a good day.  You too.  Let's go to Terrence.  Terrence lost $5,000 in penny stocks.  A lot of people learning.  Terrence.  Learning.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  What's your story?  I got two stories, man. 
[01:25:00]  I put one story.  I'm 17 years old.  And I needed some quick money for a car.  So I was watching this one stock at four and five, eight.  So the next day, it goes up to eight.  And I double my money, make $8,000.  And that was about three months ago.  I'm sitting down.  The stock is at 20 cents now, man.  Down $2,000, right?  Yeah.  But the one day, the day I put in, there's this one stock called Interactive Intelligence.  And I get this tip at 20 cents, man.  I didn't invest in it.  I should have.  I'm kicking myself in the ass.  At 20 cents, the stock's trading at $35 today. 
[01:25:30]  Well.  Up $212,000 if I were to put in that day.  And it's a classic story.  You didn't lose anything.  Yeah.  You can't second guess yourself.  Yeah.  But it's just the story.  You know, you would have $212,000.  The would have, should have, could have.  Come on.  It's in the imaginary profile, man.  All right, Terrence.  Thanks a lot, guys.  It's gotten to the point.  See, that's not somebody that lost money, though.  He's just somebody that, you know, he's hindsight.  It's gotten to the point.  I don't even listen to the stock tips anymore.  Everyone has them.  Stock tips are ridiculous.  I mean, you can.  They're like a-holes. 
[01:26:00]  Everyone's got them.  They usually stink.  Exactly.  Every night on the Long Island Railroad.  I can't go a night without hearing someone that has a stock tip telling their bud or their pal.  Yeah.  Every single night.  But the danger of the penny stocks, my brother was the one that calls me up with ECNC.  Anthony, this is great.  You know the Palm that's coming out?  Palm.com.  They got a contract with Palm.  And Palm is a subsidiary of the 3M.  This is just unbelievable company. 
[01:26:30]  ECNC, get in now.  Within three days, he calls me up.  And they halted trading on ECNC.  So I look it up, you know, I'm checking out some of the news on it.  They never had anything with Palm.  The stock, they resumed trading and it just dumped.  Like he lost a lot of money.  But then you can read the message, boys.  Hey, I'm still long and strong on ECNC. 
[01:27:00]  Everybody, this is a great stock.  No, bashers, get off the board, bashers.  We don't need your kind here.  This is great.  You'll all be coming here and we'll have the last laugh in a couple of months when it's trading at 50.  And shut up.  It's at 70 cents or something.  There you go.  Matt.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Used to be a broker in penny stocks?  Yes, sir.  All right.  Some of these stories that you hear like on the news now is just so funny because the naivety of people is hysterical.  You know, you call some guy in North Carolina or whatever. 
[01:27:30]  And they're just more than willing to talk to you, more than willing to give up money on something like they can't even see.  They can't even check a quote in the newspaper because, you know, five years ago, six years ago, not everybody was on the Internet.  Right.  And you see now people are shocked about this.  It's just so funny.  Yeah, this was happening all the time.  This was going on for years and years and years and years.  But now that, you know, people watch The Sopranos and know what the word pump and dump is, they think it's some new, uh, it's hysterical to watch this all on the news. 
[01:28:00]  This is.  Isn't that what they did to Hoffa?  A pump and dump.  It's just hysterical.  You watch all this on the news.  You hear, like, you hear idiots on the train talking, oh, yeah, I whacked the bed today.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just hysterical.  All right, Matt.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you.  Yeah, everyone's a frigging stockbroker these days.  Everyone's in it.  Joe?  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  What's up, guys?  Good.  Guys, I've got a solution for you.  You guys want to get syndicated?  Yeah.  CNBC, guys.  But it ain't happening this way. 
[01:28:30]  You're bored with the C-SPAN talk, huh?  No, actually, I'm really into brokers.  I'm just laughing my balls off over here at some of these people, man.  I mean, they're so naive, like the last guy just said, you know?  Yeah.  Like I said, this isn't the way to go if you guys want to get syndicated, man.  You guys got CNBC or MSNBC, man.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Joe.  CNBC, Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Chrissy.  Today on Money Watch.  Chrissy.  Yeah?  What's going on?  Hey, can I play Guess It's in My Pants?  Thank God. 
[01:29:00]  Okay.  Yes.  We're back.  Absolutely.  We're back to the ONA show we all know and love.  Hold on the line.  We'll talk to you in a second.  Talk about pump and dumps.  Oh, thank God.  What's in Chrissy's pants?  Thank God.  Is that a pump and dump?  Thank God we can go back to what we know and love.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  Yo.  It's Jay with Sayville.  Hey, man.  I got tanked on that ECNC stock.  You were in that, too?  Oh.  Oh.  My wife gets a tip from somebody at work.  She's like, oh, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  I get into ECNC.  Yeah.  I get in.  Three days later, just like you, man.  No.  That's like my brother.  Believe me.  I was not in ECNC.  Oh, fuck.  It's so funny.  You know what it is?  What?  It's the pyramid scam of this century.  Like, it used to be someone would come up to you and go, dude, there's a pyramid thing  going on.  All you got to do is give me $1,000, right?  Yeah.  And we go down to the hall and we all put it in and then he deals it out to people that 
[01:30:00]  have been there and brought people in.  We all make money.  In five weeks or in a week, you are the guy at the top of the pyramid and you get  $10,000.  You just got to bring in another person and everyone's like, oh, where can I throw my  money?  Please, someone take my money.  You go to the place with your $1,000.  All of a sudden, the guy gets a hold of you three days later.  Oh, dude, the pyramid collapsed.  It always collapsed.  It collapsed.  It happened.  No, everyone else.  I swear, people were making thousands.  But just when it was going to go to you, it collapsed. 
[01:30:30]  Well, don't forget about the guys who play the, I mean, you get the corporate employees  that play the stock.  They put it in the news.  They trump it up.  And then all of a sudden, they sell their shares in the stock tanks.  Yeah.  Well, that's commonplace.  Yeah.  All right.  A-O-B.  Yeah.  Indication when Bob Buckman finally gets the hell off of New York radio.  Thank you, Jay.  Take care, man.  Poor Bob.  Leave Bobby alone.  He's having fun over there.  Poor Bob.  He sounds happy.  Poor Bobby.  Bob.  We're at the Bruce concert tonight. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Listen, we got Chrissy on hold to play What's in My Pants.  Yeah.  We have Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy, handing out wow stickers at Ramsey Outdoor on Route 17  North in Paramus, New Jersey, behind Circuit City or in the Circuit City Shopping Center.  You know where it is if you're in the area.  Stop by.  Yeah, he's having a lot of fun there.  And what else did I want to say?  Oh, going to break.  Someone brought to our attention that Croc Week starts on the 18th with the crazy, insane  Aussie guy.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Croc Week.  Look at that bugger.  He's gorgeous.  Yeah.  Well, I got something from the O&A archives as we go to break here, okay?  We'll be back.  And we got to welcome Rick, our producer, back to the show.  He's back.  Rick.  Now a married man.  Yep.  Hold it up high.  Let me see.  Oh, you want to see the ring?  Hold it up.  There it is.  Wow.  Boy, that is a prominent ring, isn't it?  Jesus, God.  There ain't no mistake in that.  I've been tagged, so on a return to the wild, she knows exactly where I am.  I was going to say, that looks like a tagging. 
[01:32:00]  This one's been tagged.  Look at him.  I saw that guy this weekend.  Did you?  The crocodile hunter?  God damn, does he make me laugh.  Isn't he funny?  He's really funny.  He doesn't care what the hell he's doing.  I've seen him stick his head in a cave where there was snakes.  And the snake started biting his face.  And he's just like, look at these gorgeous creatures.  They're gorgeous.  They're biting my face.  This is gorgeous.  And he's got his wife with him.  Yeah.  She's some American broad. 
[01:32:30]  And they're in the middle of a river.  And there's crocodiles in there.  And you see one go by, a big one.  He's like, all right, watch the boat, honey.  And he jumps in.  And he starts, like, grabbing the mouth.  And he's talking as he's doing it.  I'm going to try to roll him over before he goes into a death roll.  Death roll?  Because they did, like, a crock will grab onto something and then roll.  It'll just spin.  And tackle up its tail and everything in there so it can't get free. 
[01:33:00]  And also, whatever it's grabbed onto, it's going to just, it's ripping a chunk out of it as the crock spins.  Sure.  You know, usually it's some poor dopey wildebeest that went into the river.  Not this dopey Australian guy who's trying to wrestle it on his home turf.  Yeah.  That's the alligator's home turf.  I've got him now.  Look at me.  Honey.  Okay, honey.  Now jump in.  And he gets his wife in there to sit on the crock's head.  Sit on his head, honey.  I'm going to stick my thumb up his bum and see if he's male or female. 
[01:33:30]  Well, this weekend he was chasing crocodiles.  He was chasing them?  Yeah, there was some form of crocodile.  They moved pretty damn fast and stuff.  And he was chasing them.  They were about three, four feet long.  He could run like a mother.  And he's running all over the place tackling these things.  He doesn't care.  No.  You've seen him with all kinds of animals.  And he gets bitten.  He had a kangaroo once.  And he was trying to wrestle that thing down.  And the thing's just kicking the crap out of him.  Oh, he's gorgeous. 
[01:34:00]  Look at the color on this.  It's just bleeding and everything.  Yeah.  Bob, what's going on?  You ever notice that he's always wearing those same khaki shorts and T-shirts?  That's all he owns.  That Australian outback kind of wear.  Right, right.  The guy jumps in the ocean, right?  He's going to like rescue a shark from a net.  He's wearing the same khaki shorts and T-shirts.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't change.  No, he doesn't change.  His wife throws in the scuba tank with them.  And he's still wearing this.  He's seen him scuba diving underwater in the shirt. 
[01:34:30]  In his crocodile Dundee outfit.  Right, right.  He's got the boots on over his slippers.  He's some kind of superhero, I think.  I don't know what the hell he is.  And then he's diving with those sharks.  And he sticks his hand in the hole in the coral and pulls it out.  And it's like totally bloody.  You see him on the boat.  Look, I got my hand.  He seems to have bitten me.  Yeah, no crap.  Look at what you're doing.  You're taunting him.  Guy has no fear whatsoever.  Swimming with crocodiles.  Going into mud holes.  He like ducks underneath the water, underneath the rocks, and pulls out those little crocodiles.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  Where the hell did you get that thing from?  Look at him.  Isn't he gorgeous?  Yeah, and then he's crawling along next to him, right?  Sticking his face in the thing's nose.  Oh, he bit me.  He bit my face.  I saw him.  He was holding a snake.  The thing laid right into his nose.  Oh, no.  Don't do this at home.  Don't do this.  Yeah, sure.  I was really just thinking of going out and doing that at home.  Trying to find a snake.  Thank you, Bob.  He was chasing some kind of animals with a Land Rover.  And he's on the bumper trying to rope it. 
[01:35:30]  And he missed.  So he just tells his wife to pull up next to it and jumped off the rover onto this thing's head.  It looked like he was being trampled.  Because he was.  I got him, honey.  I've got him.  Like hoof marks in his face.  Look, it's gorgeous.  You think he throws his wife around like that in the bedroom?  Probably.  Look, I'm going to roll her.  She's going into a death row.  Now I'll stick my thumb up my bum. 
[01:36:00]  I'm going to give her what we call the lycus.  Take a U-log over her head.  Jason, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I saw him making excuses for a poisonous snake once for trying to bite him.  Well, I'd be right angry, too, mate, if I was in New York.  And you were in my house trying to get my babies.  And it's like coming like two inches from him.  He's snapping away.  And him and his wife are trying to catch these poisonous snakes in like South America.  And he's making excuses for him for trying to bite him. 
[01:36:30]  This guy's such a tool that you've got to watch him.  You've got to love him.  I was laughing so hard.  Crocodile.  Between that and the Giants game, I had a lot of comedy this weekend.  O.P. and Anthony.  The Dow was up, what, 26 today and NASDAQ 48.  I'm putting my money back in my little bank account.  In your mattress?  Chris, I'm going to put it back in the bank, Anthony.  I'm going to have my little bank book, and I'm going to keep track of my savings. 
[01:37:00]  It's tough.  It's tough to make a turn a buck these days.  Quick buck.  Anyway, sharper image, Anthony.  Yeah.  The fine company that gives you the Razor Rollerboard scooter.  During that bit from the O&A archives, I was tooling up and down the hallways.  I saw that.  Having fun, man.  I love these things.  We love it.  Driving home, I saw more people riding them around on the streets of Manhattan.  A lot of people digging these things.  Hot new product for the summer, a gleaming stainless steel aluminum inline scooter. 
[01:37:30]  Lightweight, easy to maneuver, foldable for compact storage.  It's really state-of-the-art.  The thing looks like something out of the Terminator.  Adjustable locking steering arm, sleek look, and fun to ride.  Perfect for kids, teens, college students, even a few commuters, you see, tooling around on these things.  It's available only from the sharper image.  Visit one of the stores, or go online, sharperimage.com.  Or just give them a call, 1-800-344-4444. 
[01:38:00]  Listen to win.  Well, why don't we do one of the way now?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Why talk about winning when we could sit up one of our kind listeners with one, okay?  Tenth caller at 212-757-1027 will win a Razor roller board scooter courtesy of Sharper Image.  You can also win by visiting any New York area Sharper Image store and filling out an entry blank.  Each store will give away five Razors on Sunday, June 25th. 
[01:38:30]  No purchase necessary. Winner need not be present.  So stop into a sharper image near you and sign up for that, okay?  It's the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 102.7 WNEW.  New York.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  This is the most interactive radio show in America.  I would guarantee you that.  I'm very excited about tomorrow's event here, Opie. 
[01:39:00]  The 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes.  Going down tomorrow.  Screw an island.  Screw trying to survive on an island.  How about trying to survive on a 55-gallon drum?  Well, serial killers, this radio personality, taunt you.  This is the second event in our Survivor Series, Anthony.  Yes, we have the rat eating.  Last week it was people eating rats.  It's the Survivor Series. 
[01:39:30]  This week it's five fine young ladies in their bra and panties staying in a barrel for five straight hours with a lid on top as we continually dump stuff into the barrel, Anthony.  Don't want to give everything away, but yes, fish chum will be involved.  And that is not the most gruesome thing.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, no.  And we keep telling the contestants, you sure you want to do this?  It's going to get a little ugly. 
[01:40:00]  And they're all totally into it.  All in it for the hard, cold cash that will be given away.  Cold cash up for grabs and a free bicycle worth up to $1,000 from Shrewsbury Bicycle and other things.  We're just about set.  The interesting thing is we still have a few spots left if you want to come down and check out the festivities.  Yeah.  We've had listeners pledging money for a spot to come down with a friend to check out what's going on.  Yeah, we're trying to subsidize the prize money. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  I've taken it from you people.  Yeah, because for some reason the company doesn't want to help us out with this one once again.  I don't get it.  We have to make our own noise here.  So we figured, all right, what the hell, you know, we'll sell seats to the event.  Yeah.  You know, the highest bidders get to come in and check out what's going on with the girls in the barrels.  Maybe for their price they can lean over the barrel and pour some of the goop on them themselves.  Oh, very good.  Yes.  Be a little involved in a whole thing.  And if you're near the station tomorrow, we are encouraging listeners to bring stuff down that we could dump into the barrel. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  We'll decide when you get to the station whether we'll allow you to dump it into the barrel because we don't want, like, you know.  Something that might harm the people.  Something that just might burn their skin off their bodies or something.  Yes.  We don't want to make front page like that.  No, no.  And we're also going to have, like, the semi-live studio cam set up.  And we'll have all sorts of pictures as it's going down tomorrow.  Matter of fact, I think we're going to start our show tomorrow at 2. 
[01:41:30]  2?  What?  We're going to start tomorrow at 2.  Oh, 2.  Okay.  2 o'clock?  In other words, it'll be the Opie show until 2.30 and then Opie and Anthony at 2.30 to 7 tomorrow.  Oh, come on.  But I'm trying to get here.  2 o'clock tomorrow.  We'll be live.  No old bits or anything because we've got to get the girls in the barrels right at 2 o'clock because this is heavy competition going down tomorrow.  Gee, I hope our wacky radio tomorrow doesn't end up like the wacky radio stunt that happened at WMRV-FM in Endwell, New York. 
[01:42:00]  Endwell, isn't that...  Wait, wait.  I can tell you where Endwell is.  I think I drove through that stupid town like a thousand times going to Geneseo.  Yeah?  Is that near Binghamton?  Broom County?  Sloatsburg.  No, I don't think it's near Sloatsburg.  Is it near Binghamton area?  Whatever.  All right, so what happened up there? 
[01:42:30]  A radio station's attempt to generate excitement by faking an appearance by Britney Spears ended.  Wait, can I stop you for a second?  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  Oh, you can stop me.  We got Britney Spears here live in our studio.  Idiot alert first.  Rick, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Hey, listen, you're going to have that thing tomorrow with that girl and the drum.  Don't leave her inside that drum too long with the top on. 
[01:43:00]  She can suffocate.  Okay, stupid.  Really, Rick?  So if you seal the top and don't put air holes or anything, they could suffocate and die?  Real quick.  Okay, stupid.  The big yellow one's a sign.  Any other tips for our little promotion tomorrow?  No, no, that's about it.  All right, Rick, write that down.  Yeah, don't seal them in with no air holes because they may die. 
[01:43:30]  I'm glad that Rick had a call.  Take time out of his busy day to let us know that.  Thank you.  You know, just to pay him back for that tip.  Can I give him a little tip?  Yeah, yeah.  Don't inhale underwater, okay?  Because you might drown.  And could you hold that story up for a second?  Because a lot of people are getting pissed because we're not playing What's in My Pants with Chris.  Oh, okay.  Something we teased.  Yeah, see?  People don't like when we do the radio teases.  So let's...  Well, it was a breaking story, okay?  I understand. 
[01:44:00]  On the wire.  I understand, Anthony.  Hold your Britney Spears story for a minute, okay?  I'll hold Britney Spears.  All right, Chrissy, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Chrissy.  I hear you want to play What's in My Pants?  Of course.  Why not?  We like playing this game once a week tops.  We haven't played it this week, so I think we can play today.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Sareville.  All right, and what are you looking at?  Sareville.  Home of Bon Jovi, right?  Yeah.  Are you going to get the new Bon Jovi album?  Hell no.  I hear it's really good. 
[01:44:30]  Bon Jovi sucks.  I hear it doesn't sound like anything else he's put out in the last 15 years.  Really?  Is it just Bon Jovi?  Here, come on.  So you want to know what I look like?  Yeah, I do.  Okay, about 5'4".  5'4".  I got long blonde hair curly.  Well, that comes with a name.  I weigh about 130, and my chest size is a 30-60.  30-60.  Ah.  Are you happy with your large boobs? 
[01:45:00]  Okay, that sounds good.  All right, and where are you?  Are you a natural blonde?  Yes, I am.  Ah.  Oh, ho, ho.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, ho, ho.  Ah.  Oh, ho, ho.  Ah.  Oh, ho, yeah.  Oh, ho, ho.  Natural blonde.  That?  That's to be considered here.  Mm-hmm.  In this, because you know it'll be natural blonde hair.  It's a little finer.  Ah, hold on, Chrissy.  So it could affect the sound.  Things changing like crazy around here.  Ah, Larry, what's up? 
[01:45:30]  Hey, man.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just drove by Ramsey Outdoor Store in 17.  There's like two miles of traffic getting up towards the store.  And when I pulled up right by the store, there's a cop with his lights on right by you guys over there.  I'm sure he's being cool.  Yeah.  We haven't heard anything from our boys yet.  Nobody's called in yet?  No, not yet.  Hopefully everybody's safe and sound.  But traffic is backed up out there?  Yeah, about two miles getting up towards the store.  So it looks like a pretty big crowd over there, too.  Cool.  Thank you, Larry.  Thanks, guys.  Wow stickers at Ramsey Outdoor, Route 17 North in Paramus. 
[01:46:00]  Gorilla Boy will be there for a little while longer.  Let's get back to Chrissy playing What's in My Pants or What's in Her Pants.  Now, Chrissy, where are you?  I'm right here.  No, I know.  Where are you?  Oh, I'm in my bedroom.  All right.  Is Mommy downstairs or anything?  No.  Mommy's at work.  So how old are you?  I'm 21.  I'll be 22 in August.  Ah.  Oh, ho.  And you still live with Mommy?  Unfortunately, yes.  And what are you wearing?  Right now I'm wearing jeans and a T-shirt. 
[01:46:30]  Well, get the clothes off.  Let's go.  You're going to get completely naked?  Okay.  Yeah, do that.  Hang on a second.  We'll send some savages over to your house if you don't disrobe immediately.  Yeah, look out.  You want everything off?  Digitally manipulate you.  Yeah, just get completely naked.  Okay.  We'll be right back.  Get naked.  What does your bedspread look like?  Hold on.  I just had to give it to Jeff real fast.  Jeff.  Damn it.  Gorilla Boy.  She's getting ready, Ant.  Gorilla Boy, fast.  Hey, everything's cool here, man.  All right.  Primus Police are big fans. 
[01:47:00]  They got the lights on, getting tickets for the station.  Okay.  That's it.  That's what I thought.  We're having a great time.  Everybody's behaving.  You got a nice crowd out there?  Excellent crowd.  We're running along on stickers, so you better get here quick.  Uh-oh.  All right, Gorilla Boy.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  All right.  Let's go back to Chrissy.  She should be naked by now.  Chrissy?  Yes, I'm all ready.  You're naked?  Yes, I'm naked.  You're laying on your bed?  Yes.  In your bedroom?  Yes.  What does it look like?  Give us a little insight into what your bedroom looks like. 
[01:47:30]  Um, it's, uh, I don't know.  I have, like, a twin bed.  All posters all over the place.  Posters of?  TV, computer.  What posters?  Um, it's, I have a big, huge, like, cloth kind of thing.  It's like a tie-dye big, huge thing.  Cool.  I have, um, what kind of posters?  One's, like, of a tornado.  Oh, not of anybody?  I have, like, a lot of, like, pictures of my friends and stuff.  Yeah, not, dude, it's, like, total girls.  Yeah, it's, like, a real girl, but I'm sorry. 
[01:48:00]  What is, no, that's good.  That's great.  I'm sorry.  What does your bedspread look like?  Um, actually, it's all Tigger and Winnie the Pooh.  Oh, yeah!  Bad pot, Tigger and Winnie the Pooh!  I knew you guys were going to, like, make fun of me now, right?  She's laying on her Tigger and Winnie the Pooh!  And who got you that?  What?  Who got you that?  I got it, actually.  I love Tigger.  Oh, damn.  I was hoping Mommy got it for you.  Tigger and Winnie the Pooh.  You got any bad posters up in your room? 
[01:48:30]  No, I don't have any bad posters.  Bad, bad, bad, no?  Okay.  And when I ask you about your bedspread, I just wanted to know how wide.  Oh, it's, um, it's only, like, a single.  Small.  It's almost like the white shorts joke yesterday.  She's not getting it out there.  I got that one.  No, of course.  Uh, wow, that sounds good.  That sounds great.  And you're completely naked, huh?  Any toys and stuffed animals?  Um, I have a couple stuffed animals.  Oh.  It's like Tigger and Sylvester and Eeyore and stuff. 
[01:49:00]  You want to play, uh, find the honey?  Find the honey.  Only if you're searching for it.  Tigger, look, a vagina.  Yeah.  Ooh, a vagina.  That's great.  Let me stick my head in and see if I can find some honey.  All right.  I think we're ready for the theme song.  Here we go.  Yeah.  It's time to play. 
[01:49:30]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Guess what's in my pants.  It's time to go.  It's time to play.  You are gay.  What's in my pants.  All right, Chrissy, you know how to play, right?  Um, I think so.  All right, well, you just take the phone and, uh, you, uh, you go up and down on your, uh,  your area there.  Yeah, you take it, uh, slowly up and down.  Okay.  On your most intimate of areas so we can hear.  All right.  Are you ready?  Yes. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Very telling.  Sounds like she's scratching.  It's like run DMC.  All right.  Now, uh, go side to side.  Okay.  Hang on a second.  Slowly, slowly.  Very slowly.  Second?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Very telling. 
[01:50:30]  Now, a slow circular motion.  Okay.  To the right or to the left?  Uh, ooh, very good question.  We've never been asked that.  It doesn't effing matter.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Twenty-one.  Hmm?  Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  Winnie the Poop.  You got carpet in there?  In your room?  And it's not a joke. 
[01:51:00]  Is it bare wood floor on your bed floor?  No, it's a carpet.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  So, what do you think?  You have to guess now, don't you?  Yeah.  You don't tell us.  Well, I'm not ready yet.  Do you have a bed post?  No, I don't have a bed post.  No bed post.  Damn.  I'm sorry.  I'd be swinging on it.  Good question.  You got any, uh...  Have you seen that, uh, MPEG yet of the, the, the bed post?  The girl on the bed post?  No.  Okay.  Do you have any, uh, any, uh, adult toys in that bedroom?  No, unfortunately.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm ready for my decision, then.  Very telling, Anthony. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, it was.  Um, I...  Consensus on instant feedback, too.  It's like, it's almost like who wants to be a millionaire?  I could go to the audience and see what they've chosen, and from instant feedback, uh, I'm getting  a lot of, uh, this answer.  That's...  You're gonna go, uh, use the audience lifeline?  I think I'm gonna use the audience lifeline on this one.  All right.  Uh, don't, don't give the answer until everyone has, Chrissy.  I am gonna say, uh, Woodfloor, Opie.  Woodfloor.  I'm going with the audience on this one.  Okay. 
[01:52:00]  I'm, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do phone a friend.  You're gonna phone a friend?  Well, yeah.  Any listeners on hold that wanna tell me?  All right.  We'll, we'll have them call up.  And, uh, Opie's gonna use his phone a friend lifeline.  Phone a friend.  Or, or maybe should I, should I go...  The 50-50.  Wow.  Maybe I should go for the 50-50.  That would be pretty, uh, where, where they eliminate two of the choices.  That's like cheating.  Leaving only two.  All right, um, Chrissy, why don't you, why don't you just go up and down as, as I get  a, a phone a friend on the line here. 
[01:52:30]  Go up and down with the phone again.  All righty.  Okay, go ahead.  Okay.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, with the stupid delay, I gotta wait now for people to hear what I said 48 seconds  ago.  Um, hold on, Chrissy.  Um, okay.  I'm gonna go with my phone a friend.  Hold on.  Phone a friend.  Hold on.  Gotta go to four.  Oh, wait, I'll go here.  This one, actually.  Uh, who's this? 
[01:53:00]  Tom.  Hi, Tom.  You're my phone a friend today.  What, what do you think is in, uh, Chrissy's pants?  I'm going with Hitler mustache, man.  Hitler mustache.  Hitler mustache.  I hope you, uh, you can accept, uh, his help.  Yeah.  Hitler mustache.  Or go on your own.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna accept the Hitler mustache.  I'm gonna accept that.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let's go back to Chrissy.  Then we go back to Chrissy.  All right, so, Ann, what, what did you decide?  I said, uh, I went with the audience lifeline here using instant feedback and said wood floor.  And, uh, Opie went phone a friend. 
[01:53:30]  Hitler mustache.  He is accepting that one.  Chrissy, what is in your pants?  It's a wood floor.  Yeah.  Wood floor.  Wow.  That's nice.  You got, uh, have you picked up any of that Mujan to help the wood floor?  Mujan.  No, I haven't.  I hear that Mujan works well.  Anthony told me so.  Mujan.  Well, Chrissy, congratulations.  Can I get some wrestling tickets?  Um, do we have wrestling tickets?  No, we have videos. 
[01:54:00]  We have videos and stuff, like DVDs.  You don't have any tickets to see Wrestling Smackdown or anything?  No.  No.  Oh, man.  Want to go see ACDC?  Yeah, that'd be good.  Yeah?  Yeah, I love ACDC.  All right, let me give, uh, the slug line for ACDC.  Uh, you want a pair of tickets to see ACDC August 25th at the Garden.  Tickets go on sale Saturday at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster for Continental Arena August 24th  and for the Garden's, uh, the Garden Show on August 25th.  All right?  All right, thank you.  Why has Tigger's head disappeared? 
[01:54:30]  Chrissy, hold on the line.  Okay.  To get your tickets and thanks for playing What's in My Pants, all right?  Okay.  All right, there she goes.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  I love that.  Yeah.  That game never gets old. 
[01:55:00]  That is a fun little game.  Wonderful.  Pete, what's going on?  Barry, what's up?  How are you, Pete?  I want to see that show tomorrow.  I'm looking to donate money.  You want to see the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Yep.  How much are you willing to donate?  A thousand bucks.  A thousand dollars.  A thousand bucks.  At this point, it's first come, first serve.  So if you can come down here with the cash.  What time do I have to be down there?  Anytime.  The sooner the better.  Three o'clock, all right?  Are you in the area now?  Yeah, I work at 810 7th Avenue, right near you guys. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You should actually come by even earlier.  Okay.  Rick will be here at like 10 in the morning tomorrow.  Okay.  I'm dead serious.  Hold on the line, okay?  You got it.  We can even talk to him.  All right, we've got to take a break, Anthony.  Yes.  That was a lot of fun.  Indeed.  That's a fun game, isn't it?  Yeah, it really is.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, all the jokes.  I see them.  All the fun. 
[01:56:00]  I figured you took enough.  From UCS.  Hey, hey.  I left you alone.  Yes.  Say yes.  Her bedroom reminds me of my girlfriend's.  Yes.  Yes.  My girlfriend is winning the poo sheets.  Yes.  Very funny.  Christy.  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Great.  What's going on for tomorrow?  What happens if I don't fit in this damn drum?  How fatty?  We cut you up.  I'm 5'6 and 250.  How big are these damn drums?  5'6, 250.  We'll get you in. 
[01:56:30]  And you're a contestant?  Yeah.  I was the first one to call.  Okay.  Yeah, we remember you.  I wonder what I got myself into.  Were you guys really going to do this before I called?  Yeah.  Is she really in, Rick?  This is what we were trying to talk about before the show today.  We need girls that are going to fit in the drums.  Well, how are you going to fit a 250-pound girl in a drum?  She didn't tell me she was too fitty.  Too fitty.  All right.  You know something?  This whole...  No, no, no.  No, no.  We make it work. 
[01:57:00]  Someone goes to Home Depot and gets a huge frigging drum.  I've seen them in there.  They sell big things for storage.  You can go down to one of the S&M shops and get a cage.  No, we don't want cages.  We need drums.  Okay.  We'll get that fat ass in something.  Or we'll get something in that fat ass.  Hey.  Come on.  Come on!  Yeah.  Smek that ear.  Yes.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  You'll find something.  Well, Rick's going to talk to you.  I'm starting to worry about this whole damn challenge.  I've got to be honest.  Hold on, all right?  Okay.  We're trying to get the details worked out, and I'm getting nervous.  Getting a little nervous.  I wouldn't worry.  We'll shove them in there.  All right.  George from Jersey.  When you put the girls in the drum, make sure that you don't cut their heads off, or that  will affect their breathing.  Yeah, that's true.  Thank you.  Getting tips from all our listeners today.  One guy actually suggested that we don't keep the lid on too long, because the girls will  suffocate, Anthony. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Thank you for that.  So, Eddie from Fort Lee, please stop instant feedbacking, okay?  We got your message, you tool.  The guy instant feedback 50 times.  I think Chrissy's my girlfriend.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  We said it on the air.  There you go.  Don't become enemy of the show.  You'll get a lot of email.  There you go.  Now, we're going to redo that program so you can't send your message a thousand times.  I wonder what's taking so long on that.  All right.  Hey, we got to take a break. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Chuck is saying you can fit 450 pounds into a 55-gallon drum.  Of liquid.  Probably.  Right?  Hey, Chuck.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  How are you?  Good.  I work with those drums all the time.  The job I have requires it.  So, give us 450 pounds of liquid in.  I figure you could jam her fat butt into that.  Liquid.  All right.  Well, thanks for that, Chuck.  All right.  I'll be amazed if this works tomorrow. 
[01:59:00]  It'll work.  We seem to pull it off every week, though.  It'll work.  All right.  Anthony, this was just handed to me.  I guess the Hooters girls are signing calendars downstairs?  Oh, yeah?  56 and Broadway?  Hooters.  Psycho Mark's going to be down there.  Gorilla Boy's going to be down there.  Hooters girls will be signing calendars.  And we'll be giving out WOW stickers right downstairs from where we're broadcasting.  Nice.  All right.  Starting at 6 o'clock.  56 and Broadway.  We'll be back. 
[01:59:30]  Hello, New Yorkers.  What is it that makes Opie and Anthony so fresh?  Is it the fact that they're not afraid to ask difficult questions?  Are you masturbating?  Is it their excellent rapport with adoring fans?  You people are very cruel.  You'll keep listening.  We'll keep pissing you off.  There's nothing you can do about it.  Or is it just that they're masters of self-promotion?  Yeah, every day you've got to tune us in to see what stupid thing we're saying next.  Opie and Anthony.  Heard afternoons on this fine station.  N-B-W. 
[02:00:00]  Anthony, Bud Light.  I love Bud Light.  What are you drinking?  What are you drinking out there?  I'm drinking Bud Light.  I like drinking light beer.  I must say, I always ask for Bud Light.  We go back in the office after the show, crack open a few icy cold Bud Lights.  It's great.  It's a great tasting beer.  It tastes like, you don't even know it's a light beer, to tell you the truth.  I don't like when people hand me a light beer because they never taste as good.  But if it's Bud Light, fine by me. 
[02:00:30]  We are proud Bud drinkers.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Make it a Bud Light summer.  What the hell else can I tell you?  You like drinking beer?  Grab a Bud Light, for God's sake.  Drink it while you're watching the Yankees or Mets.  Yeah.  Drink it when you're hanging at the beach or on the boat.  Very good, Anthony.  Drink it while you're wowing or being wowed.  Very good.  See, we're trying to work our way through the Bud Light read.  We really do love Bud Light, but we still haven't found a unique way to talk about Bud Light for a minute. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Are you thirsty?  You want a beer?  Right.  Bud Light.  It's easy.  What do they have written?  Bud Light salutes all the Opie and Anthony listeners.  They sure do, Anthony.  Not watered down like other beers.  No, no, no.  We are proud Bud Light drinkers.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  No lime needed with a Bud Light.  Have one today.  Bud Light, the life of the party.  Bud Light. 
[02:01:30]  Make it a Bud Light all summer.  Bud Light.  Thank you.  You forgot to say drink Bud Light when you're watching the Yankees.  Drink Bud Light when you're watching the Yankees or the Mets.  It's Bud Light, Anthony.  Bud Light.  Britney Spears.  We don't play her music.  But we'd sure like to pin our legs back like a Tyson chicken.  Radio.  Gonzo style.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:02:00]  I love that little promo there.  212-757-1027.  The lovely Britney.  It's the ONA show.  You had a Britney story there, Anthony.  Yes.  Yes, Opie.  A wacky radio station promotion.  Ends in death.  What?  How long is that going to take?  But that's happened here.  Oh, don't even say that. 
[02:02:30]  I'm knocking wood.  The air holes tomorrow are going to be nice and big for the ladies.  Yes, big air holes.  Oh, radio station's attempt to generate excitement by faking an appearance by Britney Spears.  Ended when a woman in the crowd at the station collapsed.  She died later at the hospital.  What the hell?  What?  Nothing more degrading than collapsing in a radio station appearance. 
[02:03:00]  First of all, who's going to believe that Britney Spears would travel to Enwell, New York, which is outside Binghamton.  It's right near Binghamton.  All right.  So what they probably had was like, I'm speculating here.  They probably had some kind of satellite interview, a taped interview, the generic interviews with Britney Spears.  See what happens in a lot of radio stations?  They have interviews with celebrities.  It sounds like they're in the studio.  But beforehand, the radio personality goes in and copies the questions in his own voice. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  And then just cuts it all together.  And it's like, so, Britney, how's the tour going?  And all of a sudden, Britney will be, oh, it's going great.  We've had a great time, blah, blah, blah.  Meanwhile, somebody else asked her that question.  So you're giving away another secret of radio.  Oh, so probably a lot of people called and were very excited that Britney was there.  And the goofy radio guys went, hey, since there's people outside waiting for Britney, let's give them, let's give them Britney.  We got a blonde hose bag here at the studio. 
[02:04:00]  Let's just dress her up in some clothes and send her out like Britney Spears.  Well, they do this.  Well, can I tell you what they really do?  What?  It's even stupider.  Is it even stupider?  Yeah, because stations do this all over the country.  They'll say, like, NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys or Ricky Martin or Britney Spears.  Britney Spears.  We'll be at our station or there'll be an appearance, okay?  Yeah.  What they do is they get, like, a limo.  So you never actually see the person, Anthony.  Ah.  And then all of a sudden the town starts going crazy because people are like, the whole town starts going crazy because they start calling the radio station and saying, oh, my God, I just saw Britney Spears' limo. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  And it's heading toward the station.  And then they're like, yeah, well, she'll be heard for blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Then the limo pulls up and there's thousands of people.  Everyone's freaking out.  And then, you know, they throw the old April Fools or whatever the hell they want to do with that promotion.  Well, they actually had an imposter.  In this one?  Yeah.  In this one, they had a Britney Spears imposter. 
[02:05:00]  Let's see.  An interview with the Spears on Tuesday night at the station, WMRV FM in Enwell, New York.  And then a woman pretending to be Spears emerged from the station to get into her limousine.  Oh, God.  Yeah, see?  So they have the limo in front.  All right.  They went a step further.  They found someone that looks kind of like her then.  About 100 people had gathered to greet her.  That's it?  100?  That's it? 
[02:05:30]  In the crowd.  Wow, that's a great radio station.  Yeah.  Like Britney would go to a station.  We have 100 people show up to look at spats.  And they hate them.  You get 100 people outside in five minutes.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  100 people.  That's great.  All right.  Sorry.  So in this crowd of 100 people was a 37-year-old woman.  Loser.  It's called thinning the herd, people.  If you get a 37-year-old woman showing up all excited to see Britney Spears, that's a little sad. 
[02:06:00]  Well, she went into cardiac arrest when Britney emerged.  She was so excited.  And the clamor of the 100 fans is that, it's not hundreds of fans.  So would you say the 100 fans or would you say the tens of fans?  Either way.  It's tens of fans.  Okay.  It would work for me.  The tens of fans that were there to greet her.  100 people.  Wow.  She, yeah, she went into cardiac arrest. 
[02:06:30]  She was taken to a hospital.  One of the fine facilities up in Enwell, New York, I'm sure.  Where, uh, she later, uh, unfortunately, Opie, uh, died.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  It's, uh, it's kind of a sad story.  Yeah.  I think.  You know, she, uh, she was there to see Britney Spears, her probably favorite singer ever,  37-year-old woman.  And, uh, she, uh, she died.  Oh, come on now. 
[02:07:00]  That's not right.  That's not right.  That's not right.  No, not at all, man.  All right.  Let me get a man going.  I think I did it again  Maybe I'll leave 
[02:07:30]  We're going to spend  I don't know what it might seem like we're done  But you're telling me  I'm serious  I'll teach somebody's anything  I'll be just so  I think I did it again  Maybe I can't  You're lost in my pain 
[02:08:00]  Oh, baby, baby  I'm not that dancing  You see my problems  I'm dreaming away  And then the goofy station manager  Comes out  A man who identified himself as the station manager  But declined to give his name  Said, we're just trying to focus on the woman 
[02:08:30]  We're trying to figure out what happened here  Declining to comment further  Nothing sadder when the goofy radio scum have to comment on what happened  There goes his career, Anthony  Oh, that's it  Goodbye  He's already in Enwell  How much worse could it get?  God damn  At least we were in Boston when we got fired  But it was the same type of thing  Trying to explain what happened  Well, it was a goofy radio thing  Gone awry  It was going to be a great idea 
[02:09:00]  You know, just minutes earlier  They're probably all laughing  Hey, everyone  Thanks  It's Britney Spears  We pulled this off  Fantastic  Hey, get the provost's guy out there  To take some pictures  Of the crowd  And Britney running  I want video  I want  Someone's dead  Someone died  I'll write a comment  Our concerns are only with the women  Yeah  I got to get to Kinko's with my resume  Hopefully I can get a job behind Nebraska  Laurie, what's up?  I used to work at this station  Really? 
[02:09:30]  You had a  Yeah, I went to Binghamton  And I did an internship  In their promotions department  Yeah  And then I wound up doing on-air shifts with them  And I left to come back down to New York  To leave radio altogether  But I knew  As soon as you started saying  Enwell, New York  I knew it was this station  Their promotions department  Went down the crapper  We need to call them  And just openly laugh at them  Who would be Britney and Marsh?  Yeah, let's do something  No, that would be wrong  They just went through a whole overhaul 
[02:10:00]  Like they lost their programming director  Their music director for the station  Wound up leaving  Our listeners are bored right now  Find the numbers of the radio station  Give them a call  And just start laughing  They have a webpage  Is Britney there?  You guys are so wrong  Play the ambulance sound behind  Your phone call  All right, Laurie  All right, well 
[02:10:30]  Just learn from their lessons, guys  All right, cool  Later  Syndication  Sorry, we don't do the syndication thing anymore  Yeah, that's good  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey, Bill  My buddy and I  Had a college radio station  In Connecticut  And we pulled a similar stuff  With a John Popper tape  And we actually called  The ride outside the station  And got kicked out  Oh, that they thought  John Popper was here  Live in the studio  That's right  That's right  And we pulled the similar thing  And said we were giving away tickets  And  You did that on Long Island, right? 
[02:11:00]  No, it was in  Quinnipiac College in Connecticut  Okay  I think I remember reading about that  And they fired you over that?  Yeah, they booted us off the air  Wow  Yeah, because 200 people showed up  And we were looking for John Popper  And we just went up to  Chumps came out of the studio  They were kind of pissed off  They fired you over that?  Yeah  Not like they killed anyone  Like that, Brittany  Yeah, well  It's only John Popper  What do you get to say?  All right, Bill  Thank you  All right, thanks  I guess they have a website, Anthony  Can you email them, though? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah  I think so  WMRV.com, Anthony  Openly mock them for their stupid promotion  That's a great promotion  Who was doing it?  It was at night  So it was probably  Hey, Gabe  What's going on?  Hey, guys  What's going on?  How are you?  Hey, I'm from Upstate  I'm from Binghamton  Yeah  And I used to listen to that station  I know their number if you want it  What's the policy of giving another radio station's number out on the air?  I don't know  As long as we don't put them on the air 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, I could give it to you off the air  Well, I guess people could, like, look it up for themselves  It's MRV in Enwell, New York, right?  I actually think the station's in Binghamton  I think the lady was from Enwell  Oh, okay  Binghamton  WMRV in Binghamton, New York  Yeah  All right  Thank you, Gabe  Word up  Bye  Tuesday night  So I'm guessing it's JJ  JJ  Yeah, JJ  It's like, look at Arnie  Looks like JJ's going to be finding another radio job

[02:30:30]  Is everyone going to scream?  Are you going to hear girls scream?  No  Because a lot of the crowd was like  Skid Row was also  And they thought he was awesome also  Did you hear girls go like  Woo!  When he came out on stage though?  No  No but he was screaming  You know  In the clapping parts  After he sang  Everyone was screaming  Thank you Charlie  Good luck there  You need a full report tomorrow  On the crowd  The audience  Just take it  Take the hit  Go there  But do a full report  Really be observant  To the crowd

[02:40:30]  I wanted to go, but I'm not a Sebastian Bach fan.  Would you have rather seen Jack Wagner?  Yes.  Really?  Just because...  Well, Melrose.  He was on Melrose, wasn't he?  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Dr. Peter Burns, right?  And General Hospital for a while.  No, I didn't watch General Hospital.  No?  Did you bring in my theater clothes?  Yes, I did.  What are you wearing?  Nice clothes.  Are you going to dress like Sebastian?  No.  And skin rubs?  Can we see your stuff?  Black shoes and a nice little button-down shirt.  All right.

No, but maybe home.  Maybe?  After this?  You're acting like it's such a big deal.  You know this isn't a bit.  I love the zipper. 
[02:41:30]  It'll be fun.  You know we'll have fun.  Yeah.  A rockin' time.  No, I'm not wearing my acid-washed jeans tonight.  Who's Ant Kidding?  He'd go if only his girlfriend's curfew was past 9.30.  Very funny.  I learned today that there's a new segment to the show, Kill the Host from 6 to 7.  That's true.  Oh, Harry Yambag, bring your red pumpkin wagon, faggot. 
[02:42:00]  Tom from Bay Ridge, bring it on, I'll take it all.  Are you sure Marco didn't give you the tickets?  Hey!  Hey, Ant, didn't Skid Row write a song about your girlfriend?  She's only...  That was a winger.  That was a winger, yeah.  All right.  Have a good time. 
[02:42:30]  Don't forget your little opera binoculars and snuff box.  My word.  Who is Sebastian Bachman?  Diana, what's up?  Um, I think you're being very unfair to Sandy.  We have to sit through baseball games, football games, wrestling.  And you can sit through one Broadway play.  No, my girlfriend sits through all that stuff and loves it.  Yeah, well, she sits through it because she loves you, too. 
[02:43:00]  I mean, she loves to sit through it, but...  No, she sits through it because she enjoys it.  She enjoys every single minute of it.  Every wrestling match.  She likes hoops.  Yeah.  She likes hoops more than I, I think.  Okay.  And I have no argument, but still, you should sit through it just for her.  All right.  Just for her, I mean...  All right.  And then she'll give you a hummer on the way home.  Well, we're still working on that.  No, do it, do it.  All right.  All right, bye.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Opie's penis online, too. 
[02:43:30]  Opie's penis.  All right.  How are you doing?  I'm over here now.  Opie, you left me in the drawer at home.  It dialed the phone and everything.  What's that?  It dialed the phone and everything.  Yeah.  How are you going to get a hummer on the way home without me?  Could you get yourself in a FedEx box immediately and get to the city?  I can try.  I don't think I'm going to make it into the show, though.  All right.  Thank you, Opie's penis. 
[02:44:00]  No problem.  Why is my brother calling him?  Which one?  Elmo.  Elmo.  Hey.  Hey, Opie.  You know, you wanted me to send a dozen roses to Sebastian Bach's dressing room?  Your credit card didn't go through.  You have to give me something else.  How are you going to pay for that, Opie?  My God.  He's got to get the roses.  I don't know what you want me to do.  And the balloon that says, good luck, Sebastian? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  The Mylar?  Yeah.  The Mylar balloon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Thank you.  So I'll pay for it.  You can pay me back, all right?  All right.  There goes my mom.  The creator of the WOW sticker, by the way.  People giving you tips, make sure you yell ROCK real loud and give the ROCK sign with  your hands to the stage.  Do we have lighters for tonight?  Lighters.  No.  No lighters, huh?  No.  We could pick some up on the way.  There you go.  People also wondering if your denim jacket is going to have the Skid Row logo on the back. 
[02:45:00]  Is Opie going to wait by the actor's exit to get Sebastian to sign his Playbill?  Hey, John, what's going on?  J-Bill.  John.  Yo.  Shut up.  John.  Yeah.  What up?  My mother's going to go see Rent next week, and she needs a date.  And this is kind of a non-sequitur, but a spaz. 
[02:45:30]  Uh-huh.  You can't get the wrong plot.  And this should be your slogan.  Retort.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Later.  All right.  Can we move on now, or what?  Hey, Bob, what's up?  Hey, you know, I mean, this is really funny stuff, and I'm enjoying it, but we've all been  there.  We all have to do this stuff once in a while.  I mean, I'm sure Anthony's done it more than once. 
[02:46:00]  You know, suck it up.  But the bad part of it is, is why does she have to dress you, man?  Can't you dress yourself?  People picking up on that one, huh?  Well, I mean, I don't understand it.  Did she lay out your clothes in the morning, too?  No.  No.  Oh, okay.  He knows how to dress himself.  He knows how to dress himself.  Hey.  Then why'd she have to bring clothes for him?  Well, because I don't know.  Because you didn't want to wear as good clothes to work.  I thought, I thought.  And get all wrinkled.  We can't get wrinkled now, can we?  Not for Sebastian. 
[02:46:30]  Holy cow.  Get out of here, man.  Jason, what's up?  Jason.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, Opie, Anthony, Sandy, how are you?  Opie, hey.  You're pretty gay.  And Anthony just said the warning.  He didn't give you a day, did he?  Send a what?  Send a bye.  Yeah, now they all have their own sound effects at home. 
[02:47:00]  Everyone's got their sound effect machines at home now.  The homes.  The home game.  The home.  Opie and Anthony, the home game.  All right, and I think we've got to take a break.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Wow, you are just getting slammed.  What?  Is my time up?  Yeah, I guess so.  I'm not going to gay Disney.  Oh, but John from Staten Island, don't forget to stop by the store before the show for some anal-ese. 
[02:47:30]  All right, we've got to take a break here.  Thanks, Sandy.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  I just love going through the instant feedback.  It's great.  Hey, Opie, listen.  It takes for grease with Tiffany and Donny Osmond going to sell next week.  Spaz wants to go, but he can't afford it.  Brian, what's going on? 
[02:48:00]  I have the clip of Sebastian Bach singing the song in Declan Hyde.  All right, let's do that.  Okay, here we go.  Hold on.  I just want to dedicate this one to Gilda Radner, and more importantly, Rosanna.  Rosanna didn't be here.  And there is no choice.  Oh, man.
