<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a humorous, fictionalized account of a viral outbreak, swiftly transitioning to the massive lines for the PlayStation 3 release, which the hosts derided as a marketing ploy.  They then recounted a dinner with their bosses, the "Flying Hollander brothers," highlighting their perceived bizarre behavior, especially their shared dessert, a recurring point of humorous discussion throughout the show.  Jimmy Norton’s penchant for tattling was a key theme, specifically about a potential Jay Leno appearance and a run-in with former New York Governor George Pataki at a restaurant.  Norton also aired grievances about a San Francisco radio station’s editing of their show.  He further recounted a near-accident with a pedestrian, fueling his disdain for city pedestrians and cab drivers.  A caller added to the PS3 frenzy by describing throwing marshmallows at his brother in line.

The show then shifted to upcoming Opie and Anthony events: a "homeless shopping spree," an eggnog drinking contest, and the infamous 55-gallon drum challenge, which prompted graphic descriptions of past incidents involving animal organs, blood, and a participant requiring EMT attention for a cricket in her ear. A caller suggested reviving the "lesbian couch" segment. Further discussion included Norton mocking one of the Hollander brothers with a post-dinner photo, the hosts' desire to "tweak" the show by adding more female guests for risqué segments, and a caller's aborted fetus suggestion for the 55-gallon drum challenge, which was ultimately rejected.  The segment concluded with continued jokes about the Hollander brothers' shared dessert and a caller's anecdote about his mother's accidental calls.

A subsequent segment started with a discussion contrasting an older woman's technophobia with the hosts' tech skills.  This transitioned to family anecdotes, including a story about one host's sister singing along to the radio and another about an overheard suggestive parental phone call.  A large portion focused on "Club Soda Kenny's" anxieties about a Las Vegas trip with Norton and Bob Saget, highlighting his OCD.  This spurred a discussion of the hosts' own levels of "craziness."  A significant portion involved an "experiment" with raw asparagus and its effect on urine smell, featuring "Dr. Than" and an ultimately unsuccessful in-studio test in the bathroom, with attempts to broadcast the audio.  The hosts also criticized Larry King's perceived technological illiteracy and lack of understanding of the internet's political influence, interspersed with further PS3 release discussion and a brief mention of a courtroom brawl video.

The PS3 release remained a central theme, focusing on extreme measures taken to acquire the console, including a news report about a drive-by BB gun shooting at a line, which the hosts mocked extensively. A phone interview with Seth Green was hampered by a poorly formatted biography, leading to numerous interruptions and comedic tangents.  The conversation veered into various topics, including the cancellation of Green's show "Lucky Louie," the asparagus urine smell, and the "homeless shopping spree."  Crude and sexually suggestive comments were abundant, alongside discussions about an XM Satellite Radio "walkover" event, repeatedly corrected due to misinformation. A caller, Sarah, expressed disdain for video game enthusiasts, provoking further ribbing from the hosts.

The intense backlash to Sarah’s comments dominated a segment, featuring numerous offensive and sexually explicit listener calls insulting her and expressing views on video game enthusiasts and gender roles. Sarah herself participated in the heated, profanity-laced exchange.  The hosts, while initially seemingly supportive of Sarah, eventually joined the insults. The conversation then shifted to one host's pubic hair grooming mishap, leading to more sexually charged banter and a bizarre story about accidental genital exposure. The show concluded with a discussion of Andy Kaufman’s death, including listener calls and a long interview with Bob Zmuda.  Zmuda shared anecdotes about Kaufman's pranks, theories surrounding his death, and the possibility of it being faked.

A final segment featured a phone interview with Bob Zmuda, detailing anecdotes about Andy Kaufman’s eccentric stunts, including wrestling matches used to pick up women, often culminating in sex.  Zmuda described his role in facilitating these encounters and recounted deceiving David Letterman as Tony Clifton. He also shared a story of a woman simultaneously involved with Kaufman and Zmuda (as Clifton).  The conversation also included Zmuda's involvement with Comic Relief.  Other segments included a discussion of Borat's similarities to Kaufman, a news story about a man dressed as Osama bin Laden on Halloween, the "Line of the Day" segment, nonsensical conversation involving a banana, and a discussion about computer specifications. The overall tone remained irreverent and laced with crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Coming through your windows, it was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish to God they weren't.  Because I won. 
[00:00:30]  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  We've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is this frantic?  All over the place.  All right, we're coming out.  Here we go.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty. 
[00:01:00]  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  And we're off and running.  Good morning.  Good morning.  There we go.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi. 
[00:01:30]  Got a lot of bass in my mic today.  Every day the microphone sounds a little different.  A little different.  But you get used to it within seconds.  Today it's very bassy.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Glad you're aboard.  Tell a friend, will you?  Want to say hi to everybody that's waiting online for a PlayStation 3.  A PS...  Do you really want to say hi?  A PS...  A PS 3.  Why not?  People are getting online for a video game?  They're boobs. 
[00:02:00]  They are just boobs.  They're camping out.  Yeah.  I guess there's only 400,000 of them.  For the whole United States of America.  Right now.  So people, you know, hype it up.  And then they pump out a few billion of them.  And everyone has them.  But you have to...  If you have to have now, you've got to wait online.  It's a marketing ploy, isn't it?  Of course it is.  Why would...  What other reason could there be that they're only shipping 400,000 of these over here, but 
[00:02:30]  to make hype?  They've got plenty of them little people over there that could just solder those things  together and ship them over here.  Please.  It's very smart.  It gets everyone talking.  Yeah.  I walked by one of these lines last night on our way home from dinner with the Hollander  brothers.  Yes, that was lovely.  The Flying Hollander's.  They're a team.  They share dessert and everything.  It's so cute. 
[00:03:00]  It's adorable.  They're brothers.  They could do those things.  Yeah, but they order the same type of food, steak and lobster, and then at the end of  the night, we're talking about our bosses, by the way, at the end of the night, they  get a little, what was it, a little cheesecake to split like you would with your girlfriend  or wife.  Jesus.  I wouldn't put it quite that way.  Oh, I would.  It was creepy to look at.  Certainly was.  Especially when they lock their arms, they wrap their arms and fed each other. 
[00:03:30]  The dessert tray comes out and they're like, I don't know.  What do you think?  What do you want?  Well, you know, I've been good lately.  I'm thinking cheesecake.  Me too, but though that's such a big peep.  All right, we'll take a cheesecake with two forks.  Creepy.  Like, I would do that.  Get your own cheesecake.  You're rich enough.  And then split it in half.  Huh?  I would do that, split it in half, two different plates.  But they're eating off the same plate. 
[00:04:00]  I would be wasteful.  Just get your own cheesecake.  Have a couple bites.  Throw the rest of, uh...  Leave half.  Throw the rest of it away, knowing there's African children starving somewhere.  Stomp on it in front of a homeless person.  What are you talking about?  I earned that cheesecake.  I earned that.  Dinner was great.  Good food.  The palm.  And it was fun just tattling on everybody I hated to the big boss.  Oh, it was great, wasn't it?  You know, sitting there just being a tattletale.  Very interesting, because, uh... 
[00:04:30]  You know, for many years, Jimmy just flat out wasn't invited to these things,  but he's now getting invited to these high-powered meetings.  Yes.  With the big boss.  Mm-hmm.  And, man, Jimmy uses that opportunity to tell on everybody.  He gets something on his mind, and that's it.  He opens his mouth and just rats it.  You'd last in prison for, like, a day.  I know.  See it?  They would just keep you out long enough to rape you, and then they would kill you.  And, uh, you know, we're cordial, and we know how to kind of work these dinners, 
[00:05:00]  where you get your stuff in, you know?  Jimmy is all about, this is what I heard about this.  Jay Leno wants the guys on the show, and someone's keep blocking that.  Oh, he's just telling on everybody.  As my coat was coming off, hello, hello, hey, listen, this is what I heard.  Right.  The word on the street.  I got the skinny.  Let me tell you about this guy who's ready to stab you in the back.  Right.  My main complaints were the San Francisco station editing the show, and the fact that I know  people at the Tonight Show, and it was absolutely confirmed that they wanted Opie and Anthony 
[00:05:30]  to be on the Tonight Show.  And, of course, you did Letterman, and you're going to do Letterman again.  Yeah.  But it's no reason you can't do another show.  We would absolutely be, uh, thrilled to do Leno.  But the Tonight Show was told that, well, they're not interested right now.  By, uh, who and why, and we were never told, so.  The Publicist or something said that about these guys, they're not interested in doing Leno.  They're never asked.  No.  They're never consulted.  They're not interested.  And if it was you listening to the show right now, you're in trouble because of little 
[00:06:00]  Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  I snitched.  He ratted you out.  Jimmy was telling on everybody that I got this feeling that when we started walking down  the sidewalk, that he went in to tell on us.  To tattle something about us?  Yeah, I have a feeling.  A little tattle tale?  We were dining with the, uh, the, uh, future ex-governor of the state of New York.  No, we weren't.  He was in the same restaurant.  Can't we make it sound, uh, like that?  I want to make it sound like that. 
[00:06:30]  We were dining.  Were we not eating?  Uh, we were eating.  Was George Pataki there?  Uh, yes, he was.  See?  Dining with the governor of the state of New York.  What an entourage he has.  Speaking of governors.  18 friggin' black SUVs in front of the restaurant.  With lots of security.  Oh, plenty of security.  Speaking of, uh, governors, you should go work for Elliot Spitzer, you tattle tale.  Spitzer.  I really shouldn't.  You are the Elliot Spitzer of this program.  I even followed him down the street.  You know, Joel, I almost forgot to mention.  Let me tell you about this rat. 
[00:07:00]  Oh my God, it was awful.  It was really, it was uncomfortable.  Oh, I couldn't wait to fire that stuff out.  You couldn't.  I couldn't wait to rat that station out for taking out that tasteless joke that I told.  Yeah, well, it's San Francisco, uh, supposedly editing, uh, the show a bit.  For, uh, but not.  Past the FCC thing.  And past even.  You're in violation, San Francisco.  Past even, uh, past even, uh, CBS policy.  Just things that were a little rude. 
[00:07:30]  A little racy.  What do you think this show is?  Right.  I don't know.  Let us be us.  All right.  So, yeah.  That's all.  We had a really nice dinner.  Yeah.  I want to thank the Flying Hollander brothers.  Why do they fly?  Huh?  They do a lot of flying with their job.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I was wondering why they were called that.  I thought they were a track.  He's in charge of Chicago and West Palm Beach.  He's flying all over the place.  Oh, okay.  And Joel, uh, he flies to do whatever he does for the company.  I don't know.  I think he flies around to play golf or something. 
[00:08:00]  Is that it?  I think so, yeah.  Invited to play golf, uh, on the West Palm.  Enough with splitting desserts, though.  God, that was creepy.  God.  The bill was $800.  Was it?  One more piece of cheesecake, what?  $5?  You're going to save $5 to share a dessert with your brother?  I think the cheesecake was about $15.  Yeah, whatever.  They had berries.  But it was good.  And they're each waiting for their turn to take a forkful of cheesecake.  It was just...  Wait your turn. 
[00:08:30]  That's cool when you do it with your chick.  Not your brother, man.  I couldn't wait to get on the radio to talk about that.  I thought it was sweet.  Yeah, because you're a puha.  You knew it was creepy, too.  Now say it.  Of course it was.  Now say it!  If there were any other brothers, it would just be really homoerotic and creepy.  But because it's them, it's like, ah, it's kind of cool that they're still close.  Yeah, they're close.  See, that's nice.  Yeah, it is nice in a way, I guess.  What are you going to do?  That'll be two Clear Channel guys scooping and enjoying.  Watch how fast they get best. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, exactly.  A lot worse.  I had a wonderful drive back in to the city.  Yeah.  That was nice for dinner.  We had to be there at, what, 6.30?  So I figured...  It's a 20-minute drive, by the way.  I've said this many times.  In the morning when I come in, door to door, 20 minutes from my house to inside the station.  20 minutes.  So I figured if I leave at 5 o'clock for a 6.30 dinner reservation... 
[00:09:30]  It'll kill time.  Maybe go into a computer store or something.  Hey, why not?  You know?  I left myself plenty of time to find some parking and stuff.  And it is rush hour, so a little bit of traffic and stuff.  An hour and a half I left myself and still showed up late by a few minutes.  But, I mean, an hour and a half of just the most annoying type of traffic, that midtown traffic, where it's caused by... 
[00:10:00]  And I know a lot of you guys in here are pedestrians because you're city people and you don't drive around in here.  But you effing city pedestrian people should...  I revel when I hear one of you are run over.  I revel because I know exactly what happens.  It's not some guy.  It's never this.  It's never a guy standing on the corner.  The little thing, the universal language hand, red hand, or the little green walkie guy comes on. 
[00:10:30]  The green walkie guy comes on on the sign and you walk across the street and get hit by a car.  Doesn't happen that way.  Does not.  The friggin' red hand is out and you're crossing against the signal.  And you get whacked.  And I laugh.  You know why they cross when it says don't cross?  Because there's traffic.  There's traffic.  And you can't get your car across the intersection. 
[00:11:00]  So they decide to keep crossing in front, even though they don't have the thing.  Which is fine.  That's fine.  But look and see if it's clearing up for me.  Because the second I get an opening, I'm going.  I still have a green light.  I called Anthony and he was just giggling like a school girl.  I had the best experience.  It almost made an hour and a half of traffic worthwhile.  He almost killed someone yesterday.  Almost killed somebody.  And I giggled my ass off.  And it was that situation. 
[00:11:30]  I won't block the box.  I'll be a nice guy.  I won't like these friggin' cabs where they sit right in the middle of the intersection and block everybody.  Now, you got the green light.  You're looking broadsided at a cab and you just want to smash it.  Why didn't you stay behind the line?  You knew you couldn't make it.  You could see 10 car lengths ahead.  The 10th car isn't moving yet.  The lights turn in yellow.  You're going to make it?  No.  So, I'm sitting there waiting behind the line for traffic to clear up. 
[00:12:00]  Now, whenever the pedestrians see your stop, they start crossing, which I said again, is fine.  But look and see if that starts clearing up for me because the second it's cleared, I'm going.  This guy, it clears up for me.  This guy just doesn't even look.  Walks right out.  And now he's got the red signal.  Don't walk.  Right.  Steps right off the curb.  And now I have an opening.  I gas it.  And jam on the brake so it screeches and beep the horn. 
[00:12:30]  And I saw him.  I knew what I was doing.  But this guy grabbed his chest and turned around.  His eyes were giant.  He actually thought at that moment he was going to die.  His life flash.  His life flash.  Dude, he saw an Escalade grill coming at him and there was nothing he could do about it.  Was his eyes like the black dude in Caddyshack in the rowboat?  In the rowboat.  Yeah.  They were that big where he was petrified.  So, I roll the passenger window down now as I pass because he jumped back on the curb. 
[00:13:00]  You didn't add insult to injury.  You didn't add insult to injury.  I did the slow roll pass as I clapped and went, good job, a-hole.  Good job.  Almost ended up in the paper.  Another dead pedestrian.  Good for you.  Oh, I hate you pedestrians.  Hate them.  Why are you so uptight?  Because they're the ones that made me spend an hour and a half in traffic.  Them and cabs.  Mostly, though, pedestrians.  Yeah.  Pedestrians screw up traffic in this city. 
[00:13:30]  Make tunnels or bridges over every goddamn intersection.  That's what I say.  All right, look at this.  They're showing the lines.  People camping out all over the place for the PS3.  Can't wait for the riots when the doors open.  When they just let these animals in and they start beating each other over the head.  They look nice.  They got a little tent set up.  They will start.  They got a little car table set up.  That guy is playing his PSP online.  They will beat each other over the heads to get these things.  They look very civil, Anthony.  It's not enough.  Just a bunch of grown men waiting for video games. 
[00:14:00]  Exactly.  Wait two months until it's out.  What, are they not going to release them for Christmas?  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's what they're doing.  They're trying to make hype for the holidays.  Hype.  Everyone's going to get the PSP.  Hype it up.  All right, let's say hi to Keith in Connecticut.  Keith, what's going on?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  My brother's been camping out since yesterday, 11 o'clock in the morning.  And last night when I got done with work, I picked up my daughter and we went to the  parking lot and whipped marshmallows at him, standing there like a fool in line.  I like that. 
[00:14:30]  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Keith.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  Jimmy, you want to maybe get a little treat from Starbucks and share it?  Two spoons?  I'd like that.  Maybe a yogurt.  It was creepy, I say.  Creepy.  Crumb cake.  The clinking of the forks.  Your turn.  My turn.  Oh, you go.  You go.  You go.  It was creepy.  Why don't you just stop that?  Just get another one.  You're then putting the fork in your mouth and cutting another piece of cheesecake.  And then your brother now has to take that piece of cheesecake that has the fork that 
[00:15:00]  you just had in your mouth marks on the front of it.  Well, the worst part was when they split a four-pound lobster, and one of them would take a piece  of lobster out and then do the airplane thing and make the other one eat it.  Open the hanger.  I have an example of what a jerk I am.  Let me find it.  How do I get my pictures off the pictures I've taken on my phone?  Uh-oh.  How do I do that?  How do I do that really fast?  This could take hours. 
[00:15:30]  Why?  Because I'm no Larry King.  Relax, dude.  I can figure this out.  Oh, you mean you could take pictures on a telephone?  How does that work?  So we left the big dinner with the Flying Hollander Brothers, and I'm walking.  Oh, okay.  I'm walking home after I was talking to Jimmy on the corner for about, you know, five or  ten minutes, right?  And all of a sudden, I finally started my walk back up to the Upper West Side, and I turned 
[00:16:00]  the corner, and there's Joel Hollander.  Oh.  It didn't save, I guess.  Oh, boy.  Son of a...  Son of a...  Who the...  What the...  It's here somewhere.  Oh, of course it is.  I turned the corner, and I run to Joel again, and he's got flowers.  Flowers for his wife.  Aw.  Hopefully for his wife.  Yeah, you might have just...  I hope she got flowers last night.  No, again.  Slick. 
[00:16:30]  Good move there.  So I thank him for dinner, and then I just openly laugh at the big boss that pays our paycheck  on this side of the radio show, right?  And I just start mocking him and laughing.  And then I go, I got to get a picture of this.  And I pull out my phone, and I just stick it in his face.  I go, smile.  You got a picture of him with a big bouquet of flowers?  Yeah, that's what I was going to show you.  I got to find it.  Wow.  During the break.  I want to see that.  That's sweet.  It just made me giggle that I was able to kind of beat him up a little bit. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  We got lots to do.  We got the man with half his face paralyzed.  He can't smile.  We got Larry King talking about the internet.  We got other things to do.  We're just getting warmed up here.  We were discussing...  Lately, we've been discussing how to tweak the Opie and Anthony show.  Just little tweaks here and there.  And we realized...  And we're firing the whole staff.  Huh?  And we're firing the whole staff. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, that would be a good thing.  Is that a good tweak?  At least D-Rock, right?  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, at least D-Rock.  And we realized yesterday when we were discussing the radio show...  This is his head.  We haven't had a chick naked in studio that weighs less than 400 pounds in the last year.  It's been forever.  And we said to ourselves, what is wrong with us?  What's going on?  Why?  What is wrong with us?  Why? 
[00:18:00]  Why?  Because we're talking about things we need to bring back, things we got to get rid of,  people we need to bring back, people we need to get rid of.  And that little tidbit came up.  We were just talking about girls in general.  We're like, man, we haven't had hot naked girls on the show in a long time.  Doing anything.  And Jimmy's like, well, under the weight of 400 pounds.  Yeah.  I just was thinking, you know, we're basically a guy-based show. 
[00:18:30]  Guys, I think, tend to like girls.  And why don't we have some in to do some things?  And we realized we hadn't had girls in here.  And I can't remember when.  And the last ones were Big Fat Pigs or Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  Come on.  So we got to step it up.  Yeah, we got to step it up.  You know, going to tweak a few things with the radio show. 
[00:19:00]  Don't you worry.  We're very happy with the radio show.  But we realize we need to do a few different things.  Sometimes you assess things.  Yeah.  You go, you know something?  There's something missing.  Chicks.  Hot.  Chicks.  The real good dopey ones that'll do anything.  Love it.  And we should have got some PS3s for the radio show.  Well, that's kind of hard to do.  We're a massive, massive radio show. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, but we should have been able to get some PS3s.  You want sales involved for whatever we have to do?  Oh, no, no, no.  Because that's what would happen.  No.  Oh, we can get these.  I figured you'd go down to Little Italy or something and talk to the boys.  Oh, you went off the back of the truck?  Talk to the boys for us.  Fell off the truck.  How about this?  How about someone just bring us a PS3 and say, you know what?  I ain't going to have them.  You guys do such a great radio show on a daily basis.  Have this gift.  Here it is.  I don't see that.  Do with it what you like. 
[00:20:00]  I certainly don't see that happening.  Oh, yeah?  No.  Bring us a PS3.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  Bring us a PS3.  All right.  We're going to take a break, and we'll continue.  It's the O&A virus running across America.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you. 
[00:20:30]  What?  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What?  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:21:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Oh, I don't know, Jimmy.  You want to share a death by chocolate?  I certainly don't.  Mmm.  Ooh.  We got to get the ratings up so the Flying Hollander Brothers can have separate desserts so we don't have to watch and get all creeped out as they take turns with their forks. 
[00:21:30]  The German heroin needle cake.  Everyone join?  Thank God they didn't order a lava cake to share.  A lava cake?  Ugh.  Or a yogurt or anything you dip a spoon in.  Like, there's a spoon.  Whenever you put it in your mouth and you pull it off your tongue.  Yeah.  And it leaves the little...  You can actually see taste bud marks on the spoon.  Can I share that? 
[00:22:00]  No.  Sharing dessert.  Are you kidding me?  Is times that bad?  Yeah, right?  Didn't think of it in those terms.  Alright, let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey there, Joe.  Hey, one of the bits you've got to bring back, man, is the 50-gallon drum.  Well.  55-gallon drum challenge.  55-gallon.  Oh, yeah, man.  That's a genius.  50-gallon would be stupid.  Yeah, we...  Well, it's just...  It started out as the serial killer challenge, actually. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And then we turned it to the 55-gallon drum challenge because, you know, the serial killers  love the 55-gallon drums.  Yeah, they always wind up putting dead hookers in there and stuff and leaving it on the side  of the parkways and whatnot.  But, yeah, it's a great thing.  We take a bunch of girls, throw them in 55-gallon drums, seal the top up with just nothing but  a little hole, probably three, four inches across, just enough room to dump some of the 
[00:23:00]  most heinous crap you can imagine in on girls, wearing nothing but their underpants, underwears.  Let's just put it this way.  We go down to Chinatown.  Yeah.  To get some really nice stuff.  To get some delightful things.  And then a lot of people contribute, people that work on farms and people that work at  slaughterhouses.  Death factors, basically.  And they bring in animal organs, just unbelievable amounts of blood from various animals. 
[00:23:30]  Well, that's the best part of the 55-gallon drum challenge.  You know, we get an assortment of things to throw into the barrels, but then the listeners,  they show up that day with what they want to throw in the barrels.  And there's some nice surprises there.  One guy had entire innards of a pig, and it was still all stuck together with a membrane  that holds your organs together.  So he kind of just tipped the jug a little bit, enough to get it moving, and it all just 
[00:24:00]  went into that hole in the drum like a big slimy mess, just fell right in.  It's like mercury.  That disgusted me, that competition.  The smell in the studio was abominable.  We had to take Vicks and put it under our nose like crime scene investigators.  Or Quincy.  Yeah, or Quincy.  Or Quincy.  He would do that, too.  The smell is permeating the room, Sam.  Dude, that's unbelievable.  I love your impression. 
[00:24:30]  I love that goddamn impression.  It's amazing, Jimmy.  It is Klugman.  Worst smell ever, by the way.  I've ever smelled.  Yeah, that was really bad.  All right.  Good animal.  You know what?  We're going to bring back the 55-gallon drum challenge.  55-gallon drum challenge.  Game on.  We have to get through the eggnog drinking contest, which is going to happen in the first  or second week of December.  We've got a guy trying out for it tomorrow on the show.  And then we have to do the homeless shopping spree. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I believe the date on that is going to be December 16th.  Now, a homeless shopping spree, don't we usually bring in various homeless before we actually  have the shopping spree to interview them?  Yeah.  Keith is supposed to start bringing them in any day now, so any day.  It could be today.  I don't know.  I don't know what it's got planned.  And again, all points bulletin on Andrew.  Where is he?  Yeah.  We want to have him involved in this.  He earned it.  Hey, by the way, we're getting a communique from Al Dukes.  The last time you guys did the 55-gallon drum challenge, we had to change out the carpet 
[00:25:30]  in the studio and all around the studio.  That whole part of the building, they pulled up carpeting and put down a regular floor with  no carpet.  Oh, yeah.  Oops.  Well, I would hope this time there would be precautions taken.  We had precautions.  We had tarps.  It just seeped everywhere.  Yeah, because we had all sorts of just disgusting liquids that just started, you know, getting  through the tarps and everything.  How many drums did we have? 
[00:26:00]  About 10.  Were there that many?  Maybe we could cut back on that.  Remember the fatty that wanted in on the contest and we couldn't say no?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  She wouldn't fit in one drum.  One drum.  We had to get one of those landscaping green, big, huge garbage pail thing.  Yeah.  You know those huge green garbage pails that landscapers use to put the grass in and you  see them on the back of the trucks with the Mexicans?  We had to get two of those.  Yeah.  And she stood in it and then we took another one and put it on top of her and duct taped 
[00:26:30]  it where they met because she couldn't fit in a 55-gallon drum.  Yeah.  She was so big and fat.  All right.  We'll bring back the 55-gallon drum challenge in the new year.  Yeah.  Because the rest of the year is going to go by fast and we got a lot of great bits because  we still got to do Money Snatch as well.  Wanted to do Money Snatch, of course.  We're going to do Money Snatch, homeless shopping spree, and the eggnog drinking contest all within  the next month, month and a half.  So it's going to get very busy around here.  And John from Brooklyn has a suggestion. 
[00:27:00]  I think this was something good that was good on Friday.  John?  Yeah.  You should bring back the lesbian couch.  Remember the lesbian couch?  This was something that was just, it had no value whatsoever.  There wasn't an end game to it.  It was nothing but getting a couple of broads, sometimes three at a time, to get on a couch  in various states of dis-dress, not distress, and sometimes distress, and just hang out 
[00:27:30]  for the day and make out with each other.  Well, you know, the first step is to get rid of these homoerotic couches that are around  this joint.  These are the gayest couches I've ever seen.  Stupid, oversized lips that are formed into couches.  Yeah, they're big, gaudy, red couches that aren't comfortable looking.  They aren't conducive to a girl-on-girl passion.  They're conducive to man-ass.  Yeah, that's what it is.  You could just see a power bottom going wild on that thing. 
[00:28:00]  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  Dan, dan, dan, dan.  Yeah, that type of crap.  You could see the cushions on the side, easily biteable.  Those little twinges.  Hey, I got a quick clip from a past homeless shopping spray.  Ooh.  Listen to this.  This is the hissing cockroaches that were added to the drum.  Wait, that was a 55-gallon drum.  What did I just say?  Homeless shopping.  Oh, I'm sorry.  55-gallon drum challenge.  Which would have been recorded from a homeless guy's underwear.  I'm tired because we went out to dinner with the Flying Hollander Brothers. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  Could have got home early if we didn't have to sit there and watch them share a dessert.  It's creepy, I say.  Extraordinarily creepy.  Don't do it anymore.  Two forks.  No waiting.  Maybe they could take the dessert they don't eat because they don't want to get too fat,  and they could bring it in when we do the 55-gallon drum challenge and just throw it into the barrels so they could contribute.  The worst was one would start it like when one would say, moment on the hips, and the other would go, lifetime moment on the hips.  Oh, no. 
[00:29:00]  Moment on the hips.  And then they had to, like, order the same meal, too.  That was a little strange.  Like, twins do that.  You're not twins.  You're brothers.  They're almost twins.  They're twin-ish.  They both got...  Close enough.  They got massive lobsters and a piece of steak.  Big steak.  Ordering the same food, sharing dessert.  Did they eat the asparagus?  I don't know.  Something's going on there.  It's just creepy, Jimmy.  I ate the asparagus.  Oh.  Very lovely.  I hate asparagus. 
[00:29:30]  I like the taste of asparagus now, which is brand new to me.  I hated it up until about two years ago, and now I really like it, but it's just shocking  and surprising to me when you go to the bathroom.  Yeah.  It's a shock.  It really...  You ever get brand new electronics, and you rip open the plastic that it's in now?  It's a pain in the ass because everything's really sealed.  Yeah.  So you've got to really tear it, and the friction from just ripping it open heats the plastic up,  and makes the smell, that's the smell. 
[00:30:00]  Wow.  Good, good.  With asparagus.  It shocked me, though, the first time.  I was like, ah!  I thought something was wrong.  No, it's just showing you that the body's working.  Working what?  What's it doing?  A little chemical reaction.  Why does asparagus do that?  A little chemical reaction, Anthony.  It's bizarre.  I don't like it.  And that's the only food that it does that.  Yeah.  Spinach?  Right?  Don't do that.  Nah, spinach is...  Broccoli?  Don't do that.  Cauliflower?  All right.  We've got a clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Something to look forward to for the new listeners. 
[00:30:30]  Girls and drums screaming their asses off.  And we did have one casualty.  Yeah, well, yeah, well.  Oh, yeah.  Hence why we haven't done it in a while.  Well, it was a simple thing.  They have to bring in the stretcher and the EMTs.  We won't use anything that can fit in her ear.  And I'm saying her ear.  Yeah, somebody decided, because again, the listeners came down with the stuff, that crickets would  be a good idea.  Yeah.  Hundreds upon hundreds in each barrel of crickets. 
[00:31:00]  So we dumped the crickets in, and the girls are screaming, and one girl goes, a cricket's  in my ear.  So we kind of laughed and threw more crap in on top of her, the compassionate guys we  are.  And she was kind of freaking out.  She said, no, I can't get it out.  Well, because our job was to just creep them out to the point where they had to tap out.  And then obviously the last girl in the 55-gallon drum wins the competition.  Won the prize.  Yeah.  So we just kept dumping more heinous stuff in there. 
[00:31:30]  And she said, no, I can't get this cricket out of my ear.  So we have EMTs waiting.  You know, they're standing by.  And they tried getting it out.  And they said, it really crawled in there, which really creeped me out, man.  A big bug in your ear.  So the ambulance pulled up in front.  Well, they were there the whole time.  Yeah, they were there.  They were fans of the show.  So you've got to understand something else.  This girl didn't just have a cricket in her ear.  We had been doing it for about an hour and a half at that point.  So she was covered in blood. 
[00:32:00]  And other things.  And other things.  Slime.  Body parts.  Organs from animals.  Yeah.  But a lot of blood.  Her hair.  She looked like Carrie from the movie.  Yeah.  Just covered in blood because we had dumped, like, bovine blood in there.  So she's on a stretcher getting wheeled out of the building, which is not just a radio station.  It's offices.  It's a normal office building.  Oh, they hated us over there.  The horror on people's faces.  It looked like she got hit by a train somehow on the fifth floor, ninth floor, wherever it was. 
[00:32:30]  She got hit by a train.  She was that bloody.  And had to be wheeled out.  And we got a call from her later that they had pulled the cricket out.  So she was fine.  But just imagine her being wheeled out in front of all these businessmen and women.  Yeah.  And she's a bloody mess.  In her underwear on a stretcher.  All bloodied.  Blood caked in her hair.  Oh, it was great.  Remember that smell is making me sick to my stomach.  Yeah.  It was really bad.  I dumped in there.  Because there was a lot of animal organs and intestines. 
[00:33:00]  And once those broke open.  Ah.  Yeah.  And people have been asking us to bring that bit back for a couple of years now.  We've been back on radio a couple of years now.  Yeah.  All right.  You wore us down.  We're going to bring back the 55-gallon drum challenge early in the new year.  Here's a clip from a past 55-gallon drum challenge.  Oh, no.  No.  Okay.  Here is where we really separate the champions from the chumps. 
[00:33:30]  Here it is.  This is it.  This is the ultimate.  It's over.  Okay.  Girls.  I can't do it.  Girls.  On three.  And remember, girls, you want out, just say, let me out.  What is that?  That's that noise.  That was something making noise?  That isn't somebody doing that into a mic?  No.  No.  Listen, listen, listen.  Remember, girls, just yell. 
[00:34:00]  Wait, I'm going to whisper into the mic.  They're hissing, hissing roaches.  They're huge, like the ones you see on Indiana Jones.  Oh, my God, that's horrible.  Oh, no, it's horrible. 
[00:34:30]  Best bit ever.  Oh, my God.  I can't take it.  I give up.  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Are you okay? 
[00:35:00]  Wendy, how are you?  Huh?  Oh, she's horrified.  You all right?  I can't even talk right now.  Go to someone else.  All right.  Let's go to Jane.  I just want to know what that was.  Oh, my God.  That's even more horrible.  They don't even know what it is.  Oh.  Kissing cockroaches.  Don't, please.  Yeah, I don't want to know anymore.  Don't tell us until we get out.  Please.  Really?  Really.  Like, don't tell us.  Oh, you got to tell them.  Oh, you got to tell them.  You got to tell them.  Listen to the noise they make.  Go ahead. 
[00:35:30]  Listen to the noise they make.  And there you have it.  Hissing cockroaches.  Oh, that brought back memories.  You got to remember, the girls are in these very, very dark 55-gallon drums.  And they don't know what the hell's being dropped in there.  Yeah, they didn't know what was going to be dropped in the barrel.  Right.  Until it hit them.  Yeah.  And those cockroaches, the screaming sounds that kind of had that echo in the barrel.  I forgot how wonderful that sound is of a girl screaming in a 55-gallon drum. 
[00:36:00]  The great part about that bit, girls tried out to be part of that bit.  Yeah.  We didn't just pick them off the street.  They wanted in on this competition.  Yeah, they kind of had to come in first and prove that they had some kind of...  So you thought they were tough girls.  We got tough girls in general, and we just broke them down.  Yeah.  Like a serial killer would, I guess.  There's some great video of that up.  And they used a night shot on the camera.  Yeah.  Threw a little hole in the side of the drum. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  And all you see are their glowing eyes and the horrified look on their face.  And they're in their underwear, in the fetal position, just looking around and screaming.  It's great.  It's total serial killer stuff.  Yeah.  The videos are up on YouTube.  It's the closest thing to a snuff film without having a killer kick.  I think if you throw 55-gallon drum challenge into the search or Opie and Anthony into the  search on YouTube, you can find the 55-gallon drum challenge video clips. 
[00:37:00]  Yep.  I'm looking at the list of things we threw into the barrels for the third one.  Beer.  We start easy.  We started easy.  Yeah.  Just with uncomfortable stuff, sticky stuff.  We threw in kitty litter and one of the girls almost suffocated.  That was really bad.  That was a bad idea.  Yeah.  We got to live and learn.  You live and learn.  We live and learn.  We realized that wasn't good because it kicked up a lot of dust that the girls were breathing  in in the drums.  Yeah.  In a drum.  It almost blew the whole freaking contest right off the bat because we're that stupid.  We don't understand that the confines of a 55-gallon drum with kitty litter in there 
[00:37:30]  might be a little stifling and choking.  Booby Man, by the way, from Brooklyn.  Oh, yeah.  After hearing this clip, women will be running to the studio.  You watch.  You watch.  When we officially announce this contest and the preliminaries and having girls come in  to try out, you watch.  They'll come out of the woodwork, especially if we can get a really good prize again.  Raw eggs, V8, boring stuff.  Then we got to the good stuff.  Dead fish, dead squid. 
[00:38:00]  Remember the Popeye surprise?  Oh, yeah.  Fish guts, eyes, clam chum.  The smell was just horrific.  Then some guy, and remember, people just lined up, showed up at the station.  They were just in line with their stuff in a little tub or something that they wanted.  And so we got a guy with live eels.  Right.  Some of the stuff we had to just flat out say no to.  It was like toxic or it was illegal.  Yeah.  But in general, the listeners came through for us. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, the Popeye surprise.  Then a guy decided it would be smart to bring in sour cream that he left on a radiator at  work for a week.  That's what stunk.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And some people were just making their own concoctions.  They really got into it.  Like, all right, what is the most disgusting thing I can make with home ingredients?  And this guy decided sour cream on a radiator for about a week or so.  And when he opened up that tub of sour cream, I mean, people were dry heaving all over the  studio.  Then we did the live bugs and, of course, the hissing cockroaches that you just heard. 
[00:39:00]  And the video is up on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search and check it out.  But that's coming back.  We kind of realized in the last few days we've just been too nice.  The show is really good.  The show is really funny.  But we need to bring back some of this stuff again.  Just a couple of things.  Just a little tweak here and there.  Every so often that we realize, you know, where the hell have the girls been?  Right.  Have fun with the ladies.  Right.  So let's say hi to Chuck in Pennsylvania.  Chuck, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How you doing? 
[00:39:30]  I was just wondering if you guys were interested.  I have access to aborted fetuses.  I honestly do.  Well, I...  Wow.  Didn't we just say, like, illegal stuff?  Is it illegal?  I don't know.  Aborted fetuses?  What do you think, sir?  For a radio show competition?  Yeah, that could cause some problems.  They don't want them used for stem cells to cure paralysis.  They're going to let them be brought in here to drop on a screaming chick.  I don't want them curing diseases.  I don't want them curing diseases with these things, but...  But it's okay for an opiate Anthony contest. 
[00:40:00]  I want to laugh.  Well, you know the Republicans secretly want to laugh, so I bet you they would say, ah,  have fun with the aborted fetuses, you silly gooses.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, my girlfriend, she works in one.  And I'm sure she'd scoop up a few for you guys if you really want to hear.  Have access to them.  All right, well, that's one for the lawyers, my friend.  One for the lawyers.  All right, bodies.  Have a good night.  I don't have a law degree, but I'd pretty much say they'll say no.  Yeah.  But, you know, I mean, we do the type of show where we're always tweaking and thinking 
[00:40:30]  how to better ourselves.  And we really feel like we've got to bring some of this stuff back, just some of these  things.  Let's say hi to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Listen, how about special guest star and bring his own concoction, Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs.  Oh, write that down.  Mike Rowe would be a good guest for that day.  Would be a great announcer.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, we're going to take a break, get into some things.  We've got to talk about the OJ.  We've got to talk about Larry King.  We've got to talk about the man that can't smile. 
[00:41:00]  We've got to talk about K-Fed because Jimmy can't get enough of K-Fed.  How can you?  Everything is right about him.  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's lol, Jimmy Norton. 
[00:41:30]  There he is, fresh cup of joe.  Oh, you have the last bite.  Oh, are you sure?  Are you sure?  Fight over the last bite of dessert.  Did they?  I didn't catch that part, hope.  I'm obsessed with the fact the Flying Hollander brothers shared a dessert last night during  our big meeting.  That's what brothers do, I guess. 
[00:42:00]  The radio company can't be doing that bad.  Get your own dessert.  It's creepy.  You ever share a dessert like that with your brothers?  Any of them?  With my chick?  Yeah.  Never.  Oh, honey, you have the last bite.  Oh, I don't know.  When they ordered that malted with the two straws, though, that's when I had to leave.  Yeah.  Just couldn't sit there and watch them staring at each other's eyes and drinking that malted.  And they were both wearing the same sweater, like one had lettered and given the other  his sweater.  These guys are very powerful in the radio industry. 
[00:42:30]  Of course they are.  And they're sitting there with their fork eagerly waiting their turn on the cheesecake.  Looking.  Is he taking a good piece?  Oh, my God.  They had to come to a decision together.  The dessert tray comes out.  They're thinking it over.  I don't know.  Mixed berries?  No, I'm going to treat myself.  Let's treat ourselves.  Oh.  Why not?  We're out.  You know what would have been worse if they each just scooped it into the cheesecake with  their bare hands and then just fed the other one? 
[00:43:00]  Like a wedding.  Smear it on his face.  Oh, my God.  Next time we go out, separate desserts for everybody.  People are asking if one of the Hollander brothers told the other one, treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourselves.  If we don't get Andrew for the homeless shopping spree this year, I'm going to be downright  depressed.  I will really be disappointed.  We might have to get a finder's fee on Andrew.  We might have to pay one of our faithful listeners, one of the ONA pests, to find Andrew. 
[00:43:30]  You know, I hate to bring this up.  Yeah.  But you ruined it.  What?  What happened?  You chased him away.  What?  He was fine with everything else until you stepped on his goddamn cake.  Did it make that?  And then he disappeared.  Did it make for some good radio?  It made for great radio, but it's sacrifice that now we can't find him.  We can't find him.  The video is getting viewed.  I know.  Like crazy on YouTube.  I know he would have disappeared because of a stupid cake. 
[00:44:00]  I was kind of bummed.  The homeless priorities stink.  I was kind of bummed we didn't have the video camera rolling yesterday.  I got a bit brazen yesterday.  With the overweight women?  No.  The lady with the paper hat.  Oh, paper hat girl.  I was so excited.  I thought Sam was rolling.  So bad for her.  I thought Sam had his camera.  My camera.  And I thought he was videotaping so everyone could enjoy that one.  I'd do it mostly. 
[00:44:30]  You, I don't think it bothers as much, but I'd do it for Jimmy.  Because Jimmy gets uncomfortable and loves it at the same time.  Yeah.  How can you not get uncomfortable?  That's exactly what it is.  It's uncomfortable.  You wear a paper hat to work.  She does.  She does.  She was right there.  It wasn't, it wasn't behind a glass wall, like a window.  She wasn't far away.  You were, you were what?  Like four feet away from her.  Yeah, maybe.  You walked up to her on the sidewalk. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Well, she was, I got to tell you.  She was taking a little break or something.  She's from that restaurant I have a problem with because they're really snooty in there.  Snooty?  Oh, they really are.  How could anyone be snooty with a paper hat on?  Well.  That is not a restaurant.  That's what amazes me.  That says snoot.  Thank you, Anthony.  That's what amazes me.  Yeah.  You have no right to be snooty.  You wear a paper hat to work.  Paper hat.  So it's kind of like a lunch place that's really good, really good food.  You go in there and then they have all the food set out all over the place and you can 
[00:45:30]  get a sandwich or a little, little bit of this, a little bit of that type of thing.  And they have lovely desserts and seem to have a lot of.  Share one later?  Yeah.  Seems to have a lot of Europeans working there with the attitude.  And she's outside with.  You're a trash.  She's outside with her cell phone taking a little break and I decide it was a perfect  opportunity to walk right up to her and right up to her and just point and laugh.  The point.  You wear a paper hat to work.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  There's no need for that.  None whatsoever.  She couldn't feel good about it.  Hey, do we have that audio?  We should just play that real fast.  She turned around.  Right.  She just turned around so it was not, not even so much so she didn't have to look at  you.  Yeah.  But it's that, so we couldn't look at her anymore.  Yeah.  She felt so bad.  Can someone get a copy to grab this on the news?  This is American tsunami?  Question mark?  No.  Wave hits the West Coast.  No, that was a bust yesterday.  Oh, God.  They just want to tie every disaster into our country. 
[00:46:30]  They love when horrible things happen.  Well, we share some water with Japan, you know.  A little bit.  A little bit.  It's called the Pacific Ocean.  Pacific Ocean.  That's it.  That's right.  That's my mind for a second.  They're talking about, you know, Hawaii and Alaska maybe getting some crazy waves.  You know, maybe if a meteor landed in the middle of the Pacific, we'd get a pretty serious wave  on the West Coast.  If an earthquake happens in Japan, I really don't think we're going to get that big a 
[00:47:00]  tsunami on the West Coast.  I'm not even a pro when it comes to that.  Well, they outdid themselves yesterday on CNN.  They were talking about a 16-inch wave.  16-inch wave.  And you're like, well, they must have misprinted that.  It's got to be feet.  Yeah.  No inch.  All right.  Let's go to Alan.  Hey, Alan.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  During dinner, did Wanda Hollander Brothers roll a meatball over to the other one?  See, the listener's getting involved now.  Roll a meatball over with his nose and then share a piece of spaghetti. 
[00:47:30]  Take it easy, guys.  Let's go.  No, they just ordered the same food and then had to split a dessert.  Ugh.  I don't know why that bothers me.  Because it really does bother you.  Yeah, it certainly does.  All right.  Let's move on to some things.  Some things.  What are you sporting?  Well, you brought this to my attention.  I guess Larry King doesn't know anything about the internet.  Well, that was brought to my attention. 
[00:48:00]  My people in the office, I never like taking credit for things I didn't.  What happened?  I said, I can't take credit for that.  Why?  There's people in the office that work for us.  Who are these people?  Larry King did that.  I don't want to say.  Who are these people?  Just in case it bombs.  All right.  I'm protected and I'm still a nice guy to the people because I didn't rat anyone out.  That's Jimmy's job.  This is what amazes me.  Older people on technology.  I get it.  With the DVD players and things like that.  And maybe the cell phones.  Like, we got our, we got my dad a cell phone and he couldn't figure out how to retrieve, you know, voice messages. 
[00:48:30]  Older people.  Which just amazed me.  Do anything.  But in a way I kind of understood.  But what I don't understand is old people that can't figure out the internet.  They are afraid of it.  Why?  They are fearful of it.  I don't know.  It's this influx of too much information for them to deal with.  They come from a simpler time, Opie.  And the whole cell phone thing. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know how many times my phone will ring.  I'll answer it and hear Sal on the other end.  Is it a left row?  Row.  Do I make a left here row?  Or a right turn?  What store do we have to go to, row?  He, like, hits the auto dial on his phone because he doesn't lock his keypad.  I'm one of the numbers.  Yeah.  And I'll just be listening to an inane conversation between my mother and Sal. 
[00:49:30]  Isn't that the greatest thing?  Sal, you idiot.  You were supposed to turn there.  Well, if you'd tell me the goddamn turn, row, I'd have made the turn.  Oh, Sal, you're an idiot.  He's got that awful Baltimore accent.  Baltimore, row.  Baltimore, row.  Let's get some crab cakes, row.  Oh.  How did he live on Long Island for, like, a half a century or something?  Forever, but still.  He still has that Baltimore accent. 
[00:50:00]  Row.  Anthony, where's your brother Joseph?  Where's Joseph?  Joseph?  Joseph.  Where the hell do you come from?  And, you know, us Long Islanders, we have bad accents.  I understand that.  Yeah.  But the Baltimore accent.  Baltimore, row.  It's just horrific.  So, yeah, I'll get that.  Because for some reason, they can't lock the keys.  They don't know how the cell phone works.  Yeah.  My mother, I kept telling her for years she needed a computer just so we can email her pictures and stuff. 
[00:50:30]  She goes, oh, yeah.  I never get to see this or that or hear anything.  I can email you.  You get sound files and pictures.  Oh, files.  Oh.  And then I told you about Internet Movie Database.  Yeah.  Where you can look up anything.  My mother's a movie buff.  Loves the movies.  Internet Movie Database would be worth the price of admission for her getting a computer.  I go, you can look at anything.  If you have a question about any movie, it's right there.  I have my Leonard Maltin book.  Her Leonard Maltin book.  It's the size of an encyclopedia.  It takes you an hour to look up anything in it. 
[00:51:00]  It's like, Mom, just come on.  No, no, no.  Hey, Brother Joe wants to chime in here.  Oh, Joe's got a little story about that.  Hey, Joe, what's up, man?  45 minutes I was on Sal's phone.  And he rang me accidentally 45 minutes.  You stayed on and listened?  It was worth burning the minutes just to hear the garbage they had to say.  Look, it's my job to, you know, kind of take things a little further than maybe they should be taking. 
[00:51:30]  What would it take for you guys to hang up and not listen anymore to Sal and your mom?  What if they decide to kind of pull over to the side of the room?  Oh, God.  No, let's go with it a little bit.  What would it take for you?  Let's not.  You would finally go, you know what?  I got to hang up.  It would take Sal having a prostate again.  I wouldn't. 
[00:52:00]  What if they started getting frisky?  Actually, then I might listen.  Because it might be a little more interesting than what they are talking about anyway.  Yeah.  Oh, I hang up.  It's like, I'm like, hello?  Hello?  And then I realize it's just Sal again.  He sat on the phone or something.  And I hang up.  I called the doctor's office.  Sal was at the doctor's office.  I made that much out from the phone conversation.  Yeah.  Or from the non-conversation.  I called him up to the doctor's office and told the nurse to tell Sal to hang up his cell phone. 
[00:52:30]  And I heard the nurse saying it over the phone.  I had the cell up to my ear.  And he just clicked.  He clicked it off.  And he didn't say a word to me.  Yeah.  It's a little embarrassing.  He's done it so many times.  They are the lamest.  As far as any type of new technology goes, the lamest couple I know.  They're like Little House on the Prairie people.  One year, we figured it would be a good idea, or somebody did, to get my mother a camera that docks right into a printer. 
[00:53:00]  It's the easiest thing because she likes hanging a lot of pictures on the wall and stuff like that.  But doesn't want to deal with computers.  But she also doesn't want to go to the store and get it blown up.  So this thing, you can plug the camera right into this thing and print out whatever size picture you want on photo quality paper.  Easiest, easiest thing ever.  She sees the box and, like, stepped away from it like a tiger was coming after her.  Ooh, no, ooh, ooh.  She's afraid of technology. 
[00:53:30]  She has a fear of technology.  When does that start?  At what age?  60?  It depends on, I guess, what you do.  You think the 50-year-olds are doing all right?  50, yeah, that's fine.  You're still in the working environment.  You have to adapt.  Yeah.  It's a fear that it's going to be overwhelming.  Because, like, sometimes I'll look at a computer or something I'm not familiar with, and you look at all the knowledge you don't have, and you get overwhelmed, and that's what they do.  But isn't it fun to kind of figure it out for you because you're good at it?  Like, I like, I'm not, I don't enjoy it a lot of the times, but in two hours, if you sit there and actually figured out a problem and fixed it, you kind of go, oh, cool, okay, that's in my head now. 
[00:54:00]  I know how to fix that major dilemma.  But, yeah, old people are afraid of the, because it's so overwhelming.  They're at the point where they don't know what anything does on a computer.  I had them completely set up with my old Mac, my old Macintosh when I first got a PC, and I set it up so that they had online access.  They were ready to go.  We even went as far as getting them a web TV.  Remember that? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, where it was, it's easy, it's on your TV.  Don't consider it a computer.  It's like watching us write you a letter on television.  Ro, get it out of the house, Ro.  It's a monster.  Creeps.  That would be cool, man.  They'd love it, though.  All right, Joe.  Like, old people, when they get into something, they'd love it.  Yeah, I'll go see you guys later.  Yeah, yeah, they would, you know, they'd sit there and be able to chat.  So were they getting frisky as you were listening in?  No. 
[00:55:00]  No.  There's no frisk left there.  Are you kidding?  One time, my phone rang, and it was my sister going to an appointment.  She does a little real estate on Long Island, and she's just singing along to some god-awful  song that I guess Z100 or something was playing.  That's embarrassing.  Oh, it was hilarious.  I listened to the whole thing.  That's why I'll only get flip phones.  I'll not get a phone with the buttons on the outside, and they're like, well, you could  lock it.  You got to remember to lock the keys, and then you got to unlock it if you want to call 
[00:55:30]  or answer.  It's a big pain in the ass.  I heard my parents one time, I got the call, and it was like, it was, there was something  sexual going on.  No way.  No way.  It wasn't.  And I was disgusted, and then I heard my dad go, Jim, guess what she's doing now?  You always get me.  Oh, that's great.  Damn you.  Let's say hi to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Chris.  What's up, man?  Hey, Chris.  How you doing?  Good.  Did Club Soda Kenny get back here from the relief effort in Japan? 
[00:56:00]  Using his hair to sop the water up.  That dry head of his.  Yeah.  Over and out, Diamond Go.  Oh, my God.  Speaking of Club Soda Kenny, the whole ride in today.  So then I called the airline, and then the flight.  Oh, shut up.  His OCD.  He's got to tell you every step of everything he did.  Well, Jimmy's flying out to Vegas for a big show.  With Saget.  With Bob Saget and everything. 
[00:56:30]  And Kenny's stressed because he doesn't know if he's going with Jimmy or not.  And there's been all sorts of problems with the flights.  And I had to hear it.  All I said was I walked out of the door.  And because we were out late with the Flying Hollander Brothers, I really pushed it.  I set my alarm for 450, and I was out the door at 501.  Oh, boy.  I gave myself 10 minutes, brushed my teeth, did a little, like, Puerto Rican shower type  thing, and I'm out the door.  What is that?  You never heard of the Puerto Rican shower?  Of course I have.  I want you to say it, though. 
[00:57:00]  Use your imagination.  The hair looks terrific, though, right?  It's fine.  It has luster.  Yeah, run it under the faucet for two seconds.  Oh, okay.  I go, hey, Kenny, how's it going?  Oh, let me tell you how it's going.  There's all sorts of problems with Jimmy's flight, my flight.  I don't know if Jimmy wants me to go anymore.  How many seconds did it take before you realized, oh, my God, why did I ask?  Yeah, now if people would just listen to me, I would have had this figured out last week, 
[00:57:30]  but last-minute planning is always getting in the way.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I wished for green lights.  It's only a five-minute ride.  And then in the elevator.  So then what happened was with Pete and Jimmy, they said just book the flight,  but then I went back online, and the flight that was $500 originally is now $860,  but I wasn't sure if I should book it because I didn't want to get in trouble with Jimmy, 
[00:58:00]  so I waited another 12 hours.  And then when I went back online, it went up another $80.  The door shuts.  And it was more expensive.  Oh, my God, bro.  So his OCD.  But the ticket was a –  Each floor is hearing.  Right.  And I said it should have been the price that I had given for it, but then –  Dude, I can't –  There's more tickets, but then, you know, you get a better rate.  Yeah.  My mom suffers from OCD horribly, and I know I have it to a point. 
[00:58:30]  I feel so much better about myself because of you, little Jimmy Norton.  OCD?  No, just your problems in general.  I don't have OCD.  No, just your problems.  And, of course, Club Soda Kennedy.  It's just out of control.  He needs a little pill to keep him calm.  We all think each other is crazier than we are.  Yeah.  But we all, you know, think that way.  Yeah.  I think you and Jimmy are ten times loonier than I am, but you both think I'm crazier 
[00:59:00]  than both of you are.  I have no doubt in my head.  And Jimmy thinks you're crazier than he is.  You think that we're crazier than me.  I think you two are crazier than me.  No.  I think you guys are richer.  I mean, we all –  I have no doubt in my mind that you are the craziest person on this show, Anthony.  No.  There is no doubt in my mind.  Nope.  It's just been hidden.  See, I was stupid enough to admit a lot of things over the years, but the stuff is  starting to creep out.  Look at them, Jimmy. 
[00:59:30]  No, no.  No.  No, no.  What?  Watch, watch.  No, what?  It's starting to creep out, and I think it's terrific to watch.  We're all self-supporting in that way, though, because no matter how loony you think you  are, I could look over at you two and go, well, at least these two are crazier than me.  Yeah.  But you can all say that.  Yeah.  Well, Kenny –  Nice little system we got.  But Kenny's OCD.  Kenny's nuts.  Yeah.  Kenny does this thing, too.  He'll tell you something.  He has a way of making bad news, like, worse, but under the guise of he's not – doesn't 
[01:00:00]  mean to give you bad news.  Kenny, when he hears bad news, I – internally, he goes, ooh.  He loves bad news.  Oh, does he?  Yeah.  And I told him, that's the only way to do it.  He gets that little, like – that little lilt, and his eyes open, and the head shakes  a little bit.  But I don't know what they want me to do.  If they don't want me to book it, I can't do it.  He's just nuts.  He is nuts.  Oh, is that funny?  See, you know, he drives me every morning, so you don't get this – unfortunately, you 
[01:00:30]  don't get to hear this stuff.  I guarantee – Jimmy, tell me if I'm right – the whole way from Jersey to my apartment,  Jim?  Yes.  He is just sitting there like, I hope Opie asks me how I'm doing.  I hope Opie asks me how I'm doing, because he will not start the conversation, because  he has some kind of weird respect as far as that goes.  He doesn't want to – his whole thing is like, I don't want to be a bother.  Good for him.  His whole thing is, I don't want to be a bother.  I don't want to be a – so you know he's driving, just hoping that I'm going to ask. 
[01:01:00]  Please ask.  Because he needs to get it out of his system.  Please ask me something.  Hey, Kenny, how's it going?  Oh, well, let me tell you how it's going.  And here's the thing.  The ticket – HBO is flying me out, and they're flying out one more person with me, and they're  paying up to $500.  There was just a screw-up with the ticket.  Pete and his dad, unfortunately, is ill, so he's going down to Florida.  So now the ticket was open that Pete had originally booked.  It was going to book.  So Kenny is – I'm like, Kenny, why don't you just come out? 
[01:01:30]  I'm doing one quick show, but it's like, come out.  Get some miles, hang out for a day.  I want you to hang if you want to hang.  And the ticket turned out to be much more expensive than HBO would cover.  But it's like – and now he comes in today, and he's like, I'll just cancel it.  I'll use them.  It's like, eh, just come.  Just get on the plane.  I'm saying that now.  Just come.  Don't cancel the ticket.  That's great to have you there.  Right.  But he just comes in.  He's all sad.  I'll just cancel it.  Yeah.  During the commercial break, it continued.  He went right up to Jimmy.  I'll just cancel it because I don't want to be a bother to anybody. 
[01:02:00]  I love dinner.  But I told him.  Oh, my.  I love that.  Yeah.  You're so right.  You deserve to be – it's first-class accommodations for you.  That's the way it has to be.  There's two ways to do things, the right way and the wrong way.  Cliché, cliché, cliché.  That whole bad news thing is classic with him.  He loves it.  Oh.  And he doesn't look at you while he's doing it.  Like, right now, Anthony's to my left, but I'm looking between him and Ove because  Kano will go, and you deserve to be to look away from him.  You deserve – because if you look him in the eye, you're going to know he's relishing 
[01:02:30]  it because he's afraid that his truth will come out.  You deserve – I love that this happened.  I love that this happened.  James, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hey.  That's great.  That's too true, man.  So we bought my grandmother a computer.  She's like 72 years old.  Yeah.  She left it on overnight the one time.  Yeah.  Woke up in the morning, felt that it was warm, and she put it outside to cool.  Put it outside to cool.  Like it's an apple pie.  Did she put it on the windowsill? 
[01:03:00]  She put it outside on the picnic table.  Oh, that is great.  What a dumb old broad your grandmother is.  Yeah, she really is.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, I guess I'm going to do this.  You want to explain?  Yeah.  I didn't think Dan was stupid, but he showed some stupidity today.  Oh, no.  Impossible.  And now we're going to force him to do something.  Oh, no.  We were talking about asparagus.  Asparagus.  I never liked it.  Recently liked it.  But something about that smell. 
[01:03:30]  Well, it was part of our big dinner with the Flying Hollander Brothers last night.  I didn't have any.  They were cutting each other's asparagus.  I like the tips.  You like the tips, too.  I know.  Bunch of stems sitting there.  Just downright creepy.  But you eat asparagus, and then everybody knows when you go into the bathroom.  There's a chemical reaction in that.  There's something that makes this smell.  Right.  This odd smell.  Right.  And Than said he had spoken to a doctor about this. 
[01:04:00]  Because we've all wanted about it.  By the way.  Yeah, because it happens instantly.  By the way, I'm starting this terrific bit as we speak.  Oh, fantastic.  Have I enjoyed it?  You want to share that with Jimmy?  No, I won't share it.  Opie's eating asparagus.  No, we only share desserts.  Yeah.  That's right.  Opie's eating a bunch of asparagus now to do a little experiment.  Because Dr. Than has said that he spoke with a colleague of his, another doctor.  Oh, you're what?  I'm starting to think maybe I was the butt of a ruse. 
[01:04:30]  May, may.  Well, we're going to find out.  Confidence waning.  Oh, is it?  Confidence is plummeting.  What happened, Dr. Brian?  What happened?  Well, in studies that I did, the smell is not so much a function of the eater's digestive process  as it is a nasal reaction.  So that anybody who eats asparagus will experience the smell, even if they're smelling somebody 
[01:05:00]  who has not eaten asparagus.  So you're saying the asparagus, doctor, is affecting the nose.  Yes.  So that this smell, this phantom smell is always in the air.  Exactly.  But like infrared or ultraviolet light, we can't see it, or in this case, pick it up  with our olfactory senses.  Correct.  But some magical ingredient in the asparagus enlightens the sense of smell to be able to 
[01:05:30]  pick up this normally occurring scent.  Correct.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Uh-huh.  Wrong.  Absolutely wrong, or else anybody walking into the bathroom that hadn't eaten asparagus  wouldn't smell it.  Right.  Correct.  But they do.  So it always, to simplify this, it always smells, but-  Always.  When you eat asparagus, now your nose could pick it up. 
[01:06:00]  You ever see the movie They Live?  No.  With Rowdy Roddy Piper?  No.  And they had to put those glasses on in order to see the evil that was around them.  That's what asparagus is.  Okay.  Those glasses from They Live.  We all know what scent we're talking about, and let's be honest, Stan, not to disagree  with all of your studies and your colleagues.  Oh.  I think you're talking to a grunt here.  You are.  Who's kind of been involved with popcorn-flavored beverages.  You are the Jonas Salk of that subject. 
[01:06:30]  I'm Jimmy Pasteur.  And, uh, okay.  Oh, trust me.  Believe me.  Asparagus, it's affecting what you think it's affecting.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're doing a little experiment.  Now we're doing an experiment.  You're sending Iraq in there with you?  I'm eating raw asparagus at seven-whatever in the morning.  Healthy.  That's why you look as good as you do.  It's asparagus.  How bad could it be?  It's bad in the morning.  Yeah.  Instead of, like, a nice lovely breakfast.  It looks, and it's all chopped up. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  It's not, what is it, raw?  It's just raw.  It's not.  Does raw affect it the same way?  It's not grilled or anything.  As grilled or steamed would.  Yes.  It does, Jimmy?  I figured we'd get the ultimate effect if it was raw.  If it's raw.  Sure.  Boy, you are.  And I hate, hate the bottoms of this barrier.  And that's all you, is that all you got?  Yeah.  They're chewy, and sometimes they, like, they stringy off, like, spring cheese, and they  are caught between your teeth.  Then you have to ask Kenny to pick them out. 
[01:07:30]  Okay.  All right.  I told you.  I told him if he's going to give you asparagus, totally give you the tips.  First class accommodations.  There's two ways to do things.  The cliched way and the cliched way.  I'll cancel the asparagus.  So now I don't know if I should tell Jimmy, because I don't want to get him mad.  Oh, the whole way in.  It was just a, how are you doing?  And then Jimmy, he needs to be treated like a star. 
[01:08:00]  Jimmy's a star.  Maybe I'll just use my miles.  I don't know.  What do you think?  He doesn't use his miles.  He wasn't coming.  It wasn't like I needed him there, because it's only one show.  There's nothing I'm doing.  I'm not selling merch.  I wanted Kenny to come just to hang out.  I'm like, get away for a couple days.  Have a good time in Vegas.  Get that extra ticket.  Come, get your miles up and hang out.  You have to do anything.  Just relax and we'll eat.  All right.  Yeah.  We've got to take a break.  Don't stress.  Yeah.  How long?  I know it is instant, but how long do you think you should wait? 
[01:08:30]  I don't know.  About a half hour?  We'll do the exciting conclusion of the asparagus bit at 8 o'clock.  Ooh.  So don't go anywhere.  It's not a bit.  It's an experiment that is taking place during our program.  Don't go check out Preston and Steve, you asses.  They stink.  And you know it.  Like asparagus.  A little message for Philly today.  See you on a virus spreading across America.  Oh, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Homeway. 
[01:09:00]  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit  as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:09:30]  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Tell a friend about what we're doing, okay?  Still making the biggest comeback in radio history.  We got the ups.  We got the downs.  We tweaked this. 
[01:10:00]  We tweaked that.  And someday we'll be back on top again.  That's what we think.  Tom just came in.  That's right.  Tom was talking about a mattress.  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, we have a mattress sponsor or something.  He's like, you guys okay with mattresses?  And Kenny goes, uh, he goes, you might want to need something.  Kenny's like, no, thank you.  I have a thermopedic.  And a thermopedic.  Creeps me out to picture your form just being burned into a thermopedic.  You have a pedophilic. 
[01:10:30]  Creep.  So what do you think I should do?  Oh, God.  Note to self, never ask Kenny how he's doing in the morning.  It's just awful.  It really is.  I am so glad I drive alone in the morning.  It's entertaining.  I couldn't talk to anybody.  I'm one of those people like for the first half hour, I really don't need any conversation.  Leave me alone. 
[01:11:00]  I listen to the news and drive.  There's no way for them to do it.  All right, they got champagne taste and beer prices.  Cliche, cliche.  That's all I hear.  All I see is his mouth open.  I hear cliche, cliche, cliche, cliche.  I was going to trade in the ticket for something else, but, you know, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  So they say.  All right, a couple things going on.  PS3, people online to get their PS3s today. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  I'm now with you, Anthony.  There's going to be a lot of violence today.  A lot of violence.  You're going to be a lot of violence.  Yeah.  I say two people die.  Stabbing or shootings?  Stabbing, probably.  Stabbing, yeah.  You're in close range.  A lot of people.  You're going to have to use a knife.  I saw the line, man.  Oh, my God.  Now I'm with you.  Yeah.  Well, a lot of the console gaming.  And, by the way, I'm colorblind.  Oh, I know.  We all are.  It's just a feeling I'm getting by looking at the line. 
[01:12:00]  We all know who the problem is going to be.  I'm not.  See, here it is with console gaming.  I didn't see one guy in a suit online going, you know what?  I got a few days coming to me, a few sick days.  What the hell?  Remember years and years ago?  I could actually figure it out because it was Windows 95 when that came out.  People actually waited online for it.  I don't think there was one fight.  But console games brings a different element.  It's people that like playing the games but don't really want to deal with computers or anything like that. 
[01:12:30]  It's people that have a lot of spare time, let's say, also.  People that might not have to go to work.  They could sit and play games a lot.  Because the government makes it easy for them not to work.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  It's political commentary.  Easy.  Stupid government.  Here, have some of my cheesecake.  No, it's interesting that it looks like a lot of these people are never going to be playing the PS3. 
[01:13:00]  No.  No.  It's an investment.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they sell them.  Oh, yeah.  You can tell.  Only $400,000 in the whole country.  And they're saying they're going for over $2,000 on eBay.  Are you kidding me?  Why do you need the game that fast?  You've got to play.  They're going to release it for Christmas.  Are they?  Yeah, they have to.  How many new games are out for it that you can't play on PS2?  One.  There's one new game.  I don't know.  I can't believe that there are 100 games out there for this new system. 
[01:13:30]  The asparagus game.  20?  That'll only play on this system.  Yeah.  I hear some older games won't play, but they'll probably suck anyway.  This is true, by the way.  People hired homeless to wait online.  Of course.  They always hire the homeless for things like that.  Golden Buns is here for a PS3.  And, you know, I could deliver some of what P and S stand for.  Right here. 
[01:14:00]  He's in charge of the line.  Yeah.  Oh, what a mess.  Get Tibby Tom back on the show.  All right.  So that's going on.  And I'm ready for my experiment.  And lucky me, I get to decide who goes into the old bathroom with me.  Is it long enough?  Put your hand down, Eric.  Has it been long enough?  I don't know.  Someone tell me.  I just ate like a half a pound of asparagus.  It was disgusting.  I know it's instant.  I drank a bottle of water.  Am I ready to go or what?  Should I just jump up and down and shake it up a bit? 
[01:14:30]  I don't know if that'll work.  I don't know if that'll work.  Maybe if you did it wrong, now your spit smelled like that?  All right.  I'm going to decide who gets to go in the bathroom with me.  It's going to be a treat.  I want Than because he was his idea.  If you're just tuning in, Than said that...  In a medical journal entry you made.  He said that your you-know-what always smells, but it's the asparagus that makes your nose better so you could smell it. 
[01:15:00]  Asparagus has something in it that might do something to your receptors in your nose that you then pick up that scent that asparagus is famous for making.  So basically he's saying if you eat asparagus, you're the only one that's going to smell it.  Yeah.  In the bathroom.  Yeah.  Everyone else would not smell it because they didn't eat the asparagus, so they don't get these superpowers with their nose.  Superpower of smell.  God, I thought that was smart too.  How come there's nothing else?  He was my last hope on this show.  I know we work with a lot of dummies, but I'm thinking, wow, Than is intelligent. 
[01:15:30]  How come there's nothing else then?  Like if you eat asparagus, you don't go around and like, wow, I smell something that normally wouldn't be smelled like a vinyl on a seat or just a ceiling tiles emitting this smell that asparagus then suddenly brings out.  It's only that one thing.  Doc?  I'm working on precious little sleep and my theory sucks.  Oh, my God.  I like how he bails out.  That's it. 
[01:16:00]  Punch out.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You got to bring Than and Kenny in.  You got to bring Kenny in just to make you feel better.  That's a beautiful one, GH.  All right.  I also choose Club Soda Kenny to take a little walk with me in a few minutes.  Oh, wow.  He went, thank you.  A little walk?  He said, thank you.  You're not going to do it in right here?  I'm doing it right there.  That's a little walk.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were going down the hall or something.  And Anthony, because you're just a brilliant broadcaster as far as FCC goes.  And you got to figure out how to make this work on the radio.  Good luck.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Good luck.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So think it over because we'll do it in a few minutes.  I don't know.  I want a ruling on a wireless microphone and a certain sound.  Well, I don't either.  I'm thinking.  Yeah.  I'm thinking we mic these two.  Yeah.  I'm thinking you mic them also.  But if there's a sound you're hearing in the background.  I think the listeners could understand what's going on.  So maybe we could get that on the radio without actually having the sound.  And then they're just mic'd maybe slightly outside the bathroom where they're in proximity. 
[01:17:00]  And then we get their reaction.  Why?  You can hear running water.  Exactly.  If you've got running water coming out of the phone.  I know.  You can play that over the radio.  Boy, I'm just thinking of some of the mics we've taken into the bathroom at XM and laughing  at this.  Yeah.  Because there have been some shows where, wow, it sounded like a World War II incendiary  bombing going on in the bathroom.  Yeah.  And it was just totally out there over the air.  If you're wondering if you should get satellite radio for Christmas, well, let me tell you  what we do over there.  That was horrific. 
[01:17:30]  When someone has a stomach ailment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't stop the show.  No.  The show continues, even if it's an interview with a celebrity, the interview, yeah, Jimmy  will go in and continue the interview and it is.  The show must go on.  Right.  The show must go on.  Exactly.  I just want to know if we can do that.  Do we get a ruling?  Yeah.  Go get a ruling.  Al, the Duke of.  Because it's our terrific bit for today.  Oh, this one's fantastic.  It's going to put us right over the top. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  More bits for the O.B.  and Anthony show.  And we start with this one.  Oh, this is, uh, well, care of then.  Thank God.  I do what I can.  I do what I can.  All right.  Uh, let's, let's, uh, let's play this little bit of audio.  Uh, Mr. Imus.  Mr. Imus at it again today.  What did he do?  Today?  Yeah.  It is, uh, 7 o'clock here on the East Coast and I'm, uh, Opie and Anthony's, uh, dad.  Opie's dad, actually.  Porno music playing.  Uh, I miss it in the morning.  You know. 
[01:18:30]  Opie and Anthony's dad.  Uh, Opie's dad.  Ha ha.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I went over to MSNBC to film some stuff.  I don't know if they're ever going to air it.  There's some controversy.  Yeah.  I started because I was goofing off when, when, um, Joe Scarborough was, uh, interviewing  President Bush's, uh, sister.  Hoops.  And now I think they're getting really nervous about actually showing anything I did over  at MSNBC.  Really?  Because she was talking and I was doing the universal sign of, oh, the, the, uh. 
[01:19:00]  You were pumping a shotgun?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was pumping a shotgun numerous times.  And they got me on, on, uh, video looking really bored as he's interviewing, uh, the  President's sister.  That would be funny.  And I'm making the universal sign of.  Yeah.  The old home alone.  The old home alone.  And I also, uh, sat in Imas's chair over there.  Ooh.  I, uh. 
[01:19:30]  I hear also he is, like, crazy about his chair.  Yeah, they had to get it out of storage.  It was in a closet.  Yeah, because nobody can sit in his chair.  He doesn't want anybody screwing with it.  So they lock it up.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  So they got it for me.  I sat in it.  Crazy person.  I also, um, I also, uh, did something with his microphone.  Uh, yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Think asparagus, uh, a day from now.  Oh, not the one, the test we're doing now? 
[01:20:00]  No.  The one later.  And, uh.  Well, you were, you were doing sound effects with your, uh, body.  Yeah, sure.  Into his microphone.  And when I did it, the mic fell on the floor, and everyone was horrified.  I heard they gave the video to Imas, but I don't know.  Maybe he doesn't have a, uh, a sense of humor like we thought, because, uh.  Oh, no.  He's ignored the fact that I sat in his chair and, uh, pretty much defiled his microphone.  So here's, uh, Mr. Imas talking today.  It is, uh, 7 o'clock here on the East Coast, and I'm, uh, Opie and Anthony's, uh, dad. 
[01:20:30]  Opie's dad, actually.  Right.  Uh, Imas in the morning, and this is, uh.  Dad?  Do you mean granddaddy?  Granddaddy?  I hope he's grandfather.  This is, uh, and you know, I told Chernoff, I used to be the program director for Opie and  Anthony over there.  We're on the radio station, but, uh, whatever, they're free FM, whatever it is, they're on.  And, um, they're on the same time I am, but I mean, I love these guys, so.  I'm about to say, well, what are you going to do?  Boring. 
[01:21:00]  I can't listen to them, but I can't listen to them when I go to New Mexico, because they're  on in the afternoon there.  Oh.  But anyway, um, I, uh, no t-shirts.  Still?  Oh, no.  Good Lord.  You know, so don't send me any more little Jimmy Norton t-shirts.  I don't want any more of them.  Aw.  I want the brown and yellow Opie and Anthony t-shirts.  Get him one.  How difficult is this?  Apparently.  Apparently it's very difficult.  Apparently it's very difficult.  You can get him at myradiostore.com.  Well, someone should ship some over to the i-man. 
[01:21:30]  I think he should be forced to wear a Jim Norton shirt first.  That's not him.  He should be forced to wear one.  No.  Even if it's not on the air, just at his home.  At the rent.  I had all those shirts shipped over.  I ironed them.  There's a link at opieandanthony.com for t-shirts.  Buy one.  Apparently it's very difficult.  Apparently it's very difficult.  I think they're just ignoring you.  I think they're sending you a subtle message.  Well, it could be.  Thanks, but no thanks.  Well, okay, fine.  So, I saw the latest trend. 
[01:22:00]  Maybe the audience is also ignoring me.  Ah!  Whoa!  Wait a minute!  I miss.  I thought we were friends.  Just a little blip.  A little on.  A little pothole.  It's a speed bump.  A little speed bump.  These things happen.  Mighty.  Wow, I miss.  It's trend.  Maybe the audience is also ignoring them.  Oh!  It's a minute after the...  And you wonder why you're not getting any damn t-shirts, right? 
[01:22:30]  Nope.  I'm a t-shirt soaked in anthrax.  We're doing just fine, I-man.  Right, Ant?  It's like a stock.  You look at a stock, and what does it do?  It does.  It doesn't go up on a daily basis.  It does.  It goes, but as long as it's, you know, kind of moving up.  Kind of moving up.  But you're going to have your, you know, you're going to have your peaks and valleys, they call them. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, man.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You're the latest friend.  What's that gift you got over there?  Two Howard.  What's that?  Turned on a dime with a sledgehammer.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not...  You turn.  You're a petulant child.  You didn't get your 90 different t-shirts, and you got to go turn on them like that?  I have not turned on O.P. and Anthony.  I resent them.  That's...  Oh, is it just their audience has turned on them?  Yeah, it's not me. 
[01:23:30]  Okay.  All right.  I'm still there.  This is a pile-on.  They're piling on.  Ah, we are finding the trend.  Let's relax.  Every road has a little bump in it or a little pothole.  Sometimes it's just a pothole that maybe you'd normally see at Everest.  A sinkhole.  All right.  Oh, we got the clip from the walkover yesterday, and then we're going to take a break, and then  we go into the bathroom, me, Van, and Club Soda Kenny to test out this theory. 
[01:24:00]  He's saying thank you again.  He's very happy he was picked.  If this theory actually works, I'm seeing some kind of a Nobel Prize for you, or what's the  other prize?  Isn't there another prize for medicine?  The Darwin Award.  Well, we'll figure out something, but I'm sure you'll be in the Journal of Medicine. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  But I think you'll just turn up looking like an ass.  We got instructions how to do the thing, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we'll set it up after the break.  But first, E-Rock has this from the walkover.  That was a very uncomfortable moment for, I think, Jimmy more than Anthony.  Nah, it was uncomfortable.  I just walk away from those situations.  Yeah, I don't think you carry the way, but Jimmy really kind of relishes in it and just  kind of enjoys it, and then he's horrified and laughs at the same time.  Yeah.  All right, I got one.  Ready?  All right. 
[01:25:00]  You got to wear a paper hat to go to work.  Oh, no.  I can't look at her.  Oh, no.  I can't look at her.  Don't look at her.  I'm sorry, miss.  Drop something.  Yeah, good show.  Wow.  Wow.  Hi, sir.  It was awful.  Oh, is that awful?  It's awful because she has to.  And she was right there.  It wasn't like you did it with her across the street or behind a glass door. 
[01:25:30]  I don't hide with my comments for the most part.  Oh, that was horrible.  How close was I?  There wasn't a comment.  There wasn't an assault.  Look at this Frenchman.  Ha ha.  You got to wear a paper hat to go to work.  Oof.  That really wasn't awful.  It just makes me happy, though.  All right.  We'll do our asparagus, asparagus, asparagus, asparagus, asparagus, asparagus experiment next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:26:00]  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's experiment time on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Why don't you do the big setup, Anthony?  Well, Opie, we noticed, of course, last night, went to dinner with the bosses and had some asparagus. 
[01:26:30]  And there's that thing with asparagus, that thing.  When you eat it, almost instantly, if you have to go up and use the restroom, if you've been drinking a lot of water, there's that smell.  You get sort of an aroma from asparagus that you don't get from anything else.  It's ridiculous.  And I hate that smell.  Well, Tham, a doctor tell him, he said, this theory that it's just poppycock, that it's not the smell of the byproduct. 
[01:27:00]  It is the fact that the asparagus does something to your nasal receptors.  You get bionic smell.  You get bionic smell.  And the smell is constantly coming out of the byproduct.  But you just can't smell it. 
[01:27:30]  It's invisible.  It's like a phantom, a ghost.  But the magical asparagus allows you to smell it.  So if you ate asparagus, theoretically, you could walk into a bathroom, if somebody's using it,  and you would smell that smell because it's just emanating from everybody's all the time.  But the asparagus, the magic asparagus, is what makes you smell it.  We can't set this bit up enough times, I'm telling you. 
[01:28:00]  Every time.  Do you love the sarcasm out of this guy?  Yeah.  And they're saying on Paltalk, it's a hacky radio bit.  It's not hacky whatsoever.  Hacky radio bit.  You know something?  This is called torturing Than.  And let me say something.  For being dumb.  If we had sat around for a week thinking this one up, then I'd say, yeah, hacky radio bit.  But when Than comes up with a theory like this, that was given to him, we have to test it.  That's what the show is about. 
[01:28:30]  Jesus.  And it's sexy.  It is.  Three men in the bathroom together.  Come on.  All right.  And I got to pick who goes in the bathroom with me.  Oh, I didn't read the little note on what the protocol is.  Huh.  You said, here's a little note.  Oh, yeah.  Give me that note.  Let me read the protocol note.  Read it on the air because then that might wreck it.  No, that might ruin it.  Here's what the boys are saying.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Right.  You got it?  Yeah.  All right.  E-Rock raised his hand. 
[01:29:00]  Is this his feminine handwriting?  I guess.  Is that Danny's handwriting?  Yeah.  He should be dotting I's with little hearts.  You fruit.  All right.  Let's go.  So E-Rock wanted to go in the bathroom, but I said no to E-Rock.  Aw.  I chose Than.  Look at the disappointment on E-Rock's face.  Understood, Eric.  I chose Than, and I chose Club Soda Kenny.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but you picked the two biggest, strongest men in the room.  Yeah, he's hoping for an assault. 
[01:29:30]  Kenny, you're very happy I chose you, right?  I've been waiting for this forever.  All right.  Let's go on.  You're going to leave the door open?  And now, here's the problem.  There's a massive mirror here.  I don't want you guys peeking, so you guys have to...  Aren't you going to sit down and relax?  I don't...  Sit down?  What are you trying to say?  It's not a sit-down situation.  All right.  Close the door so it's more...  Oh, the door's got to be closed?  Why?  Yeah, leave it open.  Leave it open. 
[01:30:00]  Leave it open.  No, it's...  It's harder that way.  Leave it open.  You turn around.  There you go.  You turn around over there.  You turn around over there.  Just leave it open.  There you go.  Kenny, turn around, you faggot.  I want to see you unravel it.  Jimmy, will you tell him to turn around?  Kenny, turn around.  I got eyes in the back of my head.  All right, go ahead.  Kenny, turn all the way around.  All right.  Plenty of time should have passed. 
[01:30:30]  I can't smell from here.  Well, just hold on.  Get closer.  You got to wait.  All right, you guys get back up.  Don't touch my...  Kenny bumped into Opie.  You got to bump asses.  Let your butts touch.  He bumped into them.  He did.  He gave him a little bump.  Okay, here we go.  Then we're off.  All right.  Now, let's see if we can prove Than's theory.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That this, indeed, is the asparagus enhancing the smell instead of what everybody has thought 
[01:31:00]  for years and years and years and years and years and years, that it's the asparagus working  on your own body.  It's a nice color.  And it's byproduct.  No descriptions, Kenny, please.  Thank you.  No descriptions whatsoever, Kenny.  It's just always the way. 
[01:31:30]  He's just stupid.  That's good.  That's a nice one.  Hey, buddy.  Wow.  Okay.  That's good.  I feel like I'm at the track.  Keg man.  All right.  Now, with the super asparagus nose, Opie, are you noticing anything?  No. 
[01:32:00]  No?  You didn't wait long enough.  I didn't wait long enough?  I don't know.  That's not what I can think of.  Oh, God.  All right.  Well.  Maybe get your nose down there.  No, no, no, no.  I didn't wait long enough because there's nothing going on.  There's absolutely nothing going on.  We'll give it time.  A little bit later, I'm sure.  I always notice an hour.  All right.  Drink more water.  All right.  We'll try again.  Oh.  Oh, is that annoying?  Jiminy Cricket.  Absolutely nothing.  What a bust. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  Except for the fact that Kenny backed into me.  Yeah, he did.  You know what Kenny is?  Kenny's a peeker.  Kenny's a peeker.  He just wants to peek.  That's all.  Kenny's a looky-loo.  I told you.  That's what I like.  I said to him.  I'm a looky-loo.  You deserve first-class accommodations.  There's two ways to do things.  The right way and the wrong way.  All right.  Well, we need a doctor or something because there was nothing. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, there was nothing going on.  I didn't wait long enough?  You didn't wait long enough.  Or maybe that was the water that was already in me?  Maybe.  I think it's got to digest a little bit first.  So far, I'm half right.  That's all I know.  Oh, I have right.  Oh, hey, wait a minute.  Wow.  I didn't smell anything, so I'm half right.  Don't worry.  We're going back to the Opie and Anthony lab in a little while here.  The fact that Opie didn't smell anything is key.  Yeah.  And, you know, not every experiment works the first time you do it.  John in Miami, what's up? 
[01:33:30]  I'm very impressed with the scientific method that's been done here.  There was a hypothesis formed.  Yep.  Experimentation.  Yes.  Observation, and then, you know, we've got to reevaluate what happened, but apparently  nothing happened there.  Well, so far, nothing.  And, John, you forgot the most important part of a bunch of queers just masquerading as  scientists checking each other out in a men's room.  I thought you were just, you almost put your brains together, and unbelievable things happen.  All right.  Yeah, see?  All right.  What happened? 
[01:34:00]  Ah, what are we getting?  Actual, um, 15, 30 minutes.  Some of the, uh, constituents.  Constituents.  Okay, look.  It's going to have...  Oh, constituents.  Wow, I've never seen it spelt out.  Sweetie.  I have never seen constituents spelt out.  I've talked about this.  Some of the constituents of asparagus are metabolized and excreted by the human body.  You know where.  Blah, blah, blah.  Giving it a distinctive, mildly unpleasant odor. 
[01:34:30]  The smell is caused by various sulfur-containing degradation products.  Example, theols and theoesters.  Yeah, studies show that about 40% of the test subjects displayed this characteristic smell,  and a similar percentage of people are able to smell the odor once it is produced.  There does not seem to be any correlation between people's production and detection of the smell.  Hmm, interesting.  So, there's no correlation between the production and detection. 
[01:35:00]  I mean, Bill, you can notice it.  So, somebody else...  I rest my case.  No, this is saying somebody...  No, no, no, no, we're going to...  He goes, I rest my case.  Rest your case.  Flush it.  The speed...  And here it is.  The speed of onset...  Yeah.  ...of the smell is rapid...  Yeah.  ...and has been estimated to occur within 15 to 30 minutes from ingestion.  I was under 30 minutes, so...  Oh, you had three.  Yeah, so we got to try it again.  We'll try it again before we get out of here.  Basically, none of us knew what we were talking about. 
[01:35:30]  Everyone was wrong.  Apparently, I mean, according to us, I thought it was 100% of the time...  Yeah.  I thought it gave you magic powers, and you could fly.  Wait, wait, wait.  It helps you see the beauty in people.  That's it.  Brother Joe.  Yeah, just one time for you guys.  I've eaten a lot of raw asparagus in my day, a lot of raw vegetables, and I can tell you  right now, it's got to be cooked.  Yeah, that's what I think, too.  I think it has to be cooked.  Because that probably changes the chemical...  Huh?  It doesn't release the chemical that's needed to create the aroma. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, I think you need some kind of cooking, and then that'll change the chemical makeup,  and then you're getting more of the sulfur things being released.  I love the hot plate boneheads.  All right, thank you, sir.  Brother Joe knows about science.  Cooking it.  Jared in Boston, what's up?  Hey, you guys do experiments like you do math.  Frunkist!  So far, it's been a bust. 
[01:36:30]  I can't believe we were frunkist by America.  I hate being frunkist.  It's hurtful.  All right, here's the Larry King clip we were supposed to do about a half hour.  Oh, about him being stupid as far as technology and computers.  The internet as a political medium, viable?  What?  What adult?  Who's he talking to, by the way?  Roseanne Barr.  Roseanne Barr.  Yeah.  The internet as a political what?  Medium.  Of course.  This guy is supposed to be up on what's going on in the world. 
[01:37:00]  He's a newscaster or an interviewer.  I don't know what he does.  I don't know what you'd describe it as.  A lot of people think he's a brilliant broadcaster and great at interviewing people.  Not really.  How do you not know that the internet is huge politically?  It is now influencing more people politically than probably any other medium.  It's where you go to research the candidates. 
[01:37:30]  It's where they can put out information that they can't put out on television.  Who the hell researches the candidates?  I don't mean in-depth research.  I mean, you pop on CNN.  You pop on a candidate's website and you're getting dirtier commercials.  I don't mean dirty that way.  I mean, you know, mudslinging.  You look at a political end and then you go, okay, I got to vote for the other guy because  this guy is just not right.  That's all.  The internet, though, is blogs, message boards. 
[01:38:00]  Blogs?  Political.  Yes.  You read political blogs?  Not me.  But I'm saying people, especially a lot of liberal Democrats tend to be younger.  They're involved.  Politically viable?  The internet.  The guy's a moron for asking that question is what I'm saying.  I love political blogs.  I love to know what people are thinking about politics by reading their blog.  I'm blogging.  Blog. 
[01:38:30]  Are you?  The internet as a political medium.  Viable?  Yeah, it's like the only one left.  Absolutely.  And that's not just me saying it.  That's everybody saying it.  Thanks, Fatty.  Yeah, but if you know where to look, you know, it all can come together.  When you're looking for the particular information that you're looking for, after you do the big  search, this is what I found out by going on there.  It just takes your mind, and then you live in there forever.  You can never come out.  Never gone searching. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God.  It just opens up the whole universe.  It's so awesome.  You would love it.  Anything you want to know.  The wife loves it.  I wouldn't love it.  What do you punch those little buttons and things?  You just click on this thing.  The thing is, you've got to be able to read.  So you have to have strong glasses when you're over 50.  And then you just scroll down and click.  It's not that hard.  I can show you how to do it.  No, thanks.  Look, no, no, thanks.  I don't even want to know.  This doddering old buffoon doesn't even know how to use a computer and doesn't even want 
[01:39:30]  to know.  No, thanks.  That's an old douche in suspenders who lobs up softball questions.  Anthony, two Jews, what do they do?  Walk into a bar.  They own it.  Thanks, Larry King.  What an idiot.  How could the guy come off as being informed when he's interviewing people and not know or  want to know how to use a computer?  It's one thing if you're ignorant.  That's fine.  That can be cured. 
[01:40:00]  But she said, you know, I'll show you.  And right away, no.  Bah.  What is it with the old folk?  It's amazing.  You would think Larry King would know what the Internet's about.  Larry King.  He's got some research on his guests.  Let me type up what I'm going to talk about tonight.  Ding.  Ding.  With his fedora with the little press pass tucked in it.  1930s ass.  Like, we're lucky enough to get a lot of big name guests on our show. 
[01:40:30]  The Internet makes it so easy.  You Google their name.  You go to their website.  You get all sorts of nice little info that you could ask him about.  Yeah.  How is he getting all that info?  His staff.  His staff does all.  They know how to use computers.  Good point.  He knows nothing.  All right.  Well, Larry King doesn't know what the Internet's about.  Larry King?  Douche.  That's what I'm saying.  All right.  The big story.  People online for the PS3s.  They have gone to the mattresses, or at least gone to the lawn chairs, all in anticipation 
[01:41:00]  of Friday's release of PlayStation 3.  We checked out all the survival skills and all that stuff.  They said to come with a group.  I've been here since yesterday, too.  Why?  I mean, you know that it's got glitches.  You know there's probably going to be a better model coming out later.  I can't wait six months.  I've been waiting almost a year.  I guess this means that this thing is going to fly off the shelves.  We're expecting that to be pandemonium.  I just had to stick this shot in.  Take a closer look at the guys playing video games at the Best Buy showroom.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  The guy on virtual guitar.  The PlayStation 3 comes out tomorrow, and Nintendo's Wii comes out on Sunday.  So this holiday season is definitely about the video gamer, but who's going to take control  over that precious spot on top of your television for video games is anybody's get.  That guy just on a news show with an I love black people shirt on.  Black guy on the news show.  It's a story about the PS2 or 3, sorry.  PS3, right.  And they're demonstrating it on one of the news channels here, bowling and boxing and stuff. 
[01:42:00]  And there's a guy just sitting there, black guy, with an I heart, you know, I love black  people shirt on.  What's wrong with that?  Try to get on the news with an I love white people shirt on.  Yeah, exactly.  Or buy one of those shirts for your daughter.  I just, it just struck me, and I hate that double standard thing, so.  It's once again, just kind of silly.  It's like, we need an African sex, stop it. 
[01:42:30]  Just stop.  Enough with the shirt.  But it's cool.  This game is like they have, it's like you hold the controls in each hand, and when you  throw a punch on the screen, the glove throws a punch.  Which, wait on the telegrams and interactive, which will be done in 20 years.  Ah, the future.  Now we're getting there.  Yeah, you hold on to the thing.  It's not just, you know, using the controller.  You hold on to two separate controllers, one in each hand, and you can box, or what they're  doing, playing tennis.  That game looks awful.  Oh, it's like, they're like little, uh, Cabbage Patch Kids.  It's actually, it's the Nintendo Wii. 
[01:43:00]  Is that the Wii?  Yeah, that's why.  What's up with the Wii?  That's the one with the controller where you move.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  That one looks awful.  This is where, let me tell you something.  This is where I fall off the map, because console gaming blows.  I hate it.  It's getting much better.  Oh, it stinks.  Especially with the high def and all that.  High def what?  People still hooking it up to their TV sets.  No, is that a video game?  Oh, no, that's.  Yeah, that looks like a video game.  That's a courtroom brawl. 
[01:43:30]  Caught on tape.  That's the, every day you get the video of the day.  Love that one.  Today's is great.  A bunch of family members attacking some scumbag perp.  I think I've seen that before.  I forget what he did, but it was great.  That is a good one, because one guy comes running down the hall like he just heard something  and wanted to be involved.  He comes running down the hall in a hunter's outfit and jumps over the little, maybe they  ought to make those fences in courtrooms a little higher than one and a half feet tall  that they walk through.  They should take a page from Iraq, man.  Yeah, but they just put them in cages.  Yeah, they put every person in an individual cage. 
[01:44:00]  Put them in a cage.  No, we got a, what, a three-foot little fence?  It's a little, like, little saloon doors that are about a foot and a half high.  Who's that stopping?  Everybody jumps over it.  The grandmother of the victim jumps over and starts laying in some punches.  I'm all for the family of the victim getting some shots in.  Getting some shots in.  It's nice to see.  It's always fun to watch.  Always fun to watch.  At least being able to tickle him.  All for it.  If he doesn't like it.  Hey, let's say hi to BCH, a faithful listener of the show. 
[01:44:30]  BCH, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  What do you think?  The automobile, the means of transportation, viable?  Oh, Larry, you get into it and drive.  It's wonderful.  Do you want me to show you?  No.  No.  I hear if a man attains a speed greater than 30 miles per hour, he will surely perish.  A horse and buggy is good enough for me.  Rochester, you're on the air.  Radiation to remove this softball from my prostate. 
[01:45:00]  Viable?  Let's hope not.  Stupid, Larry King.  Next thing you know, they'll be talking about powered flight.  I'll stick to the iron horse for my transportation.  What an idiot.  What's this thing I'm talking on?  Chicago, you're on the air.  How am I talking to Chicago?  What a douche.  Chicago, dot, dot, dash, dash, dot, dash, dot, dot. 
[01:45:30]  Ooh, I invented that.  Oh, yeah, well.  I hate a stupid studio backdrop.  Looks like light bright.  Why can't TV?  It does.  Light bright, making things with light.  Before the show, does he change them around a little?  Yeah.  I want a little more red over there, a little blue.  I want it to look like a rubber ducky.  The only kind of computer game I like, light bright.  Or Battleship.  He probably plays Battleship, but he can't figure out how to make the little ship stay. 
[01:46:00]  More PS3 audio.  I took a week off of work.  Did?  How does the boss feel about this?  He doesn't know.  I hope he's not watching this.  Craigslist has deals online with people who will wait online for you, for a fee, of course.  The console was released last Saturday in Japan, and they're already selling on eBay for just  look at those prices three times more than what they cost.  But these folks say what they get is not going on eBay.  Now you see why some people think you're crazy? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, I can see why, but it's worth it.  Technology at its best.  How so?  I mean, for most people, technology is a cell phone.  No, a cell phone is, that's going to be obsolete real quick.  It's a piece of features there.  Ah, the joy of saying, I got it first.  Pablo Busman, CBS Genovese.  Uh, did I hear, did I hear someone in there say that the cell phone will be obsolete soon?  Yeah, explain that, Einstein.  Yeah, what is that one?  Please explain that to everybody.  There's, I hate when people say anything's going to be obsolete because they just don't 
[01:47:00]  know what they're talking about.  Oh, moron.  How is the cell phone going to be obsolete?  Not only is the cell phone not going to be obsolete, we're going to be doing more things.  More with the cell phone.  It's not like, like the cell phone goes away and gets incorporated into something.  Into what?  Other things will get incorporated into your cell phone because that is what everyone  carries now.  That is the electronic device everyone carries with them so that you have to then bring things  into the cell phone.  What an idiot.  I just hold my PS, my PSP up to my ear and talk into that. 
[01:47:30]  Sorry, I just don't get it.  Anyway, once they do actually hit store shelves, the 20 gigabyte PlayStation 3 will retail for  about $500.  The 60 gig model will go for about $600.  The news lady doesn't get it.  You've got to get it to a certain extent.  People are really into their gaming.  Yeah.  I think it's a little silly to stand on line.  Yeah, standing on line is silly.  Did you ever stand on line for anything?  Ozzy concert overnight. 
[01:48:00]  Overnight?  Used to be concert tics.  Sure.  But that's a one-time event.  I mean, look at these idiots.  If people on this line worked as hard at school.  Holy Jesus.  They're going to wait until people buy it and rob them.  You know there's line cutting going on, too.  They're like tailgating.  There's tents.  They've set up tents.  How do you use the bathroom?  Oh, that parking lot needs a 70-year-old man that mistakes the gas for the break. 
[01:48:30]  Well.  Just right up that sidewalk.  Well.  It crushes them all against the Best Buy wall.  That'd be great.  And then the doors open and someone just walks in and buys one as he looks at the crushed  people that were there for a week.  Well, it's funny you say that because there was an incident in Kentucky.  Oh, good.  And the scum that is the news people, they left something out of the story until the  very, very end.  Why don't you guess what it is?  Wait, wait.  Did Steve walk up and eat through a tent? 
[01:49:00]  I smelled something.  It was computers.  Gurr.  We begin tonight with a drive-by shooting involving people waiting in line for a video game.  Drive-by shooting.  All right.  We've had our first bits of violence.  Drive-by.  A little drive-by going on.  Four people were hit by BBs, including our own reporter.  And now police are.  The reporter got hit with BBs. 
[01:49:30]  Put an eye out.  I want to get my slingshot out of the attic.  Yeah.  Get some acorns.  Our standing guard outside the Lexington store.  Elizabeth Dorsett is live at Best Buy with tonight's top story.  And Elizabeth, first of all, are you okay tonight?  Amber, I'm actually okay.  I was just hit in the back of my left leg.  Now three other people.  Oh, God.  I was just hit like she's in Baghdad.  I was just about to say that, Anthony. 
[01:50:00]  Stop it.  If you didn't know better, this is a report from Baghdad.  I've got a welt.  The size of a dime on the back of my leg.  Back to you.  Back of my left leg.  Now three other people who have been camping out here were also hit by BBs.  Two of them have packed up their campsites, saying a PlayStation 3 simply isn't worth it.  They've packed up.  I love this shooter, whoever he is.  Yeah.  Who is that?  Come forward. 
[01:50:30]  Two dozen people are camping out, waiting for their PlayStation 3s.  Many are shocked and angered by the drive-by shooting.  I'm actually hoping to come out here and sit and wait for a system.  I didn't expect to get shot at.  Not to get us.  While we were talking to Brett Combs, both of us were hit, shot by BBs aimed at the crowd.  Ow.  That really, really hurt.  I think I got a shot with a BB.  That's it?  Ow.  That's it?  I got to hear that.  Ow.  Ow.  That really, really hurt. 
[01:51:00]  Shot by BBs aimed at the crowd.  Ow.  That really, really hurt.  That.  And they're saying being shot.  I didn't expect to be shot at.  Now let me ask you, was she shot or did someone make an unpleasant remark?  Yeah.  Ow.  This really, really hurt.  Paid a lot for these shoes.  Ow.  That really, really hurt.  I think I got a shot with a BB, guys. 
[01:51:30]  I think.  Police cruisers will be here until 8 o'clock Friday morning, making sure the more than 30  campers are safe.  There's a bunch of people sitting here.  You know, you could have seriously hit somebody in the eye or anything.  I don't want to get shot.  And while some are a little uneasy by what happened tonight, they're planning to stay.  Because it's the only shipment that comes out before Christmas.  I'll do it again.  I'll do it again.  Even if I get shot again.  By the way, they're not campers.  They're douches.  Right.  Wow.  Camping.  There you go.  What's the big story today?  What can I tell you? 
[01:52:00]  Really, really hurt.  Oh, that really hurt.  Really, really hurt.  Hey.  She probably just got an Indian burn or something.  Yeah.  Pink belly.  I've been shot.  Say.  Hmm.  That really, really hurt.  Oh, is that Barbara Walters working?  I hate Barbara Walters.  It's a montage of Barbara Walters talking to celebrities over the years.  The montage.  All right.  We got to take a quick break. 
[01:52:30]  What happened?  Iraq continued the montage song.  What did he do?  He kept saying it?  Yeah.  Wait, what did you say, Iraq?  Because I just went, it's a montage.  Yeah, I finished the rest of the song.  No, finish it.  So Anthony said, it's a montage.  Montage.  Oh, my God.  Why do we work?  Why do we work alongside these people?  I don't know.  Why did you feel like you had to continue the song, Iraq? 
[01:53:00]  You just have to.  That's how it goes.  I can't hit you with no mic.  You just have to.  Yeah, one more time.  Anthony?  It's a montage.  Montage.  You're making me sick to my stomach.  You know that?  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's terrific.  Not only do I want Iraq fired, but I want him promoted first, then fired to me.  So it hurts a little more. 
[01:53:30]  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opiananthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Coming this Monday to the Opie and Anthony walkover.  It's the official launch of the virus.  A new channel, new shows, and a new logo.  XM 202 becomes the virus on Monday, November 20th. 
[01:54:00]  Join Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and all the regulars for the walk to XM, including walkie-talkie guy, guy who smells bad consistently, guy who takes pictures of everything, flea man, backwards-walking fat guy with webcam, and other highly unemployable individuals.

[01:54:30]  You know, that thing that you already have, because you're hearing this, right now.  Opie and Anthony, XM 202.  Take two.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Here's the deal.  We need to find an ONA pest or a faithful listener that could get me a PS3. 
[01:55:00]  We need an ASAP.  If we get one, I will walk to the front of the line with the PS3.  I will present it to everybody.  This is what it looks like, people.  And then in front of everybody, after the oohs and ahs, I will take a sledgehammer and smash it in front of everyone.  Someone has to make that happen.  Somebody out there has to help me.  And I will pay for the PS3. 
[01:55:30]  I think you'd have a hard time getting one.  Let's see what happens.  If you can pull that off.  You never know.  Come on, Kenny.  And talk...  Talk to Seth Green as I set up take two.  We gotta try the experiment again here.  Oh, we're doing take two?  Yeah.  Seth is up.  Seth.  Hey.  How you doing, man?  Good, guys.  How you doing?  First, I gotta say something.  I wanna...  You ever see the movie Alien? 
[01:56:00]  You know what Ash did to Ripley with the magazine?  I wanna roll up the bio that has been given to me on Seth Green and shove it down Roland's throat like the magazine.  Is it necessary to have...  Seth Green, born February 8th, 1974, in Overbrook Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Green was born to parents Herb Green and Barbara Gash.  Is this necessary? 
[01:56:30]  Well, now I need to read the whole thing.  All right.  Keep going.  In Overbrook Park.  I could probably give you most of these facts and it might be more interesting.  Ah, see?  Well, is this just your bio or is this one that Roland made up?  This might just be his standard bio.  Yeah, it probably is.  It's a standard bio.  Yeah, but don't you think the standard bio printed out and given to us is a little cluttered?  Yeah.  Super dense.  Yeah.  And like Seth's been on the show a few times.  I think we know him enough where we don't have to be like, so, um, your father's name was Herb. 
[01:57:00]  I think those are just the basic details that, uh, Regis and Kelly get, you know?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Hey, Seth, I'm a huge fan of, uh, Robot Chicken.  Oh, thanks.  And, uh, I have one question for you.  Can you get t-shirts?  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, uh, the, uh, adultswim.com website has been down for a bit while they're restructuring,  but it's about to go back up online and we've got a bunch of products available.  Well, do you have a, um, I Poop Rast t-shirt? 
[01:57:30]  I don't think so.  Dude, I want one of those.  I'm going to make my own.  I'll make a note of it.  Because ever since I saw that on Robot Chicken, I just walk around my house going, I Poop Rast,  I Poop Rast.  Oh, good.  But that would make a hilarious shirt is what I'm thinking.  I will, uh, I'll give you credit if it ever gets made.  You know, I'd love to continue on this, but, uh, very important here.  Hey, did you know Jodie Foster's production company, Egg Pictures, is named after Green's character  in the Hotel New Hampshire, in which, uh, she also starred? 
[01:58:00]  I think that's debatable.  Oh, not, not as far as this goes.  And let me tell you something, Seth.  I got it right here on the paper that Roland gave me.  Well, you know what?  You want to, you want to...  It's so funny because I had a whole piece of paper that said there were WMDs in Iraq.  Oh, okay.  Roland, comment.  Hold on, Roland, do you want...  Seth, this is, uh, Roland, he books the show.  And I want to get to the other important thing that Roland made sure we had, that you have  an older sister.  I would love to get to that, but Roland, first, do you want to explain this?  Uh, yeah, I didn't realize it was nine pages. 
[01:58:30]  I was on my way to a movie screening last night.  What were you seeing?  Uh, The Fountain with Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz.  The what?  The Fountain.  The what?  The Fountain?  Darren Aronofsky's new movie.  The Fountain, though, he says.  The Fountain?  The Fountain?  The what?  The Fountain?  The Fountain.  The Fountain.  I know the movie, I've seen the trailers for it, it looks pretty good.  Is it called The Fountain?  The Fountain, yes, or The Fountain.  Ew, The Fountain.  The F...  What is it called?  The Fountain.  The Fountain.  The Fountain. 
[01:59:00]  He can't say Fountain.  See, Seth Roland is really not good in front of a microphone.  No.  He panics.  He chokes.  How is he in a movie theater?  Even worse, I would imagine.  Well, we like him to interview people, because he's actually a fan of yours, he loves your  stuff, and he's like nervous because you are on the phone.  He's a little nervous.  He is a nervous Nelly.  We're all on the radio, so that should probably be more nervous.  It's all right.  How did you like The Fountain?  The what?  The Fountain.  How did you like The Fountain? 
[01:59:30]  It was really good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hugh Jackman was really good, and Rachel Weisz.  Was really good?  Yeah.  So, your review would be dot, dot, dot, really good.  Dot, dot, dot.  Roland.  Yeah.  You're on, Robot Chicken's on four days a week, man, Saturday through Wednesday?  Or is it five days?  It premieres on Sunday, though.  You know, enough about Robot Chicken.  Do you know that Seth shares a birthday with Motley Crue singer Vince Neil?  What?  Wait, get out of here.  I didn't see that.  I, you know, I'm just pulling these factoids right out. 
[02:00:00]  It's amazing, this nine-page bio on Seth Green that we have.  Oh, my God.  Roland, how about bullet points?  Ed, it's working.  Oh.  Oh, Seth.  Oh, my God, is it working?  We're doing an experiment.  Don't turn around.  You just look.  Ooh.  Why did you peek, man?  Ooh.  We're doing an experiment here today.  The asparagus.  Do you like asparagus?  Do I like asparagus?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know what it does, right? 
[02:00:30]  It makes your pee smell horrible.  All right.  In a way, a little more radio-friendly, we notice that once you eat asparagus, it makes  a certain fragrance in the bathroom.  That's all we need to say.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, because certain other things are happening.  Now turn around real fast.  Now, Than, one of the guys that works for us, says that it isn't actually the byproduct  that has the odor to it, but the, listen to how ridiculous this is. 
[02:01:00]  The asparagus makes your sense of smell like magical, where you can smell this smell that's  coming out of everybody all the time.  Sort of like the glasses and they live.  Thank you.  That's the example, Anthony.  That's the example I gave.  That is exactly it.  The glasses and they live.  Until you eat the asparagus, you don't smell the evil smell.  Well, it was really bad.  All right, so now Opie had asparagus about an hour ago, and now you just went into the 
[02:01:30]  room and checked it out, and you were able to smell something, Opie.  It was brutal.  Brutal.  And then when I screamed, it was brutal.  Than turned around and got a peek at what I'm packing, first of all.  Did he look?  Yeah, you looked.  Aw, now he's got something on you.  That's it.  Years from now, he'll be at other radio shows going, remember Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, that guy had a little...  Well, you were in the...  I took a bunch of pictures on my cell phone.  Yeah, right? 
[02:02:00]  But I think the problem was, it was brutal, but these guys had their backs turned to me  for the most part, so I don't think they got to...  But they could have turned back around when you were done and kind of hover over what you  left there and kind of gotten the smell.  Yeah.  And we did.  You did?  And I'm right.  No, you're not.  No, you're not right.  Did you smell it?  No, and neither did Kenny.  Kenny, did you smell anything?  Kenny has the sinuses of the Sphinx. 
[02:02:30]  He can't smell anything.  I know.  I didn't want to say that, though.  I got to go for a shot once a month so that I don't blow boogers out every time I cough.  So, did you guys change the format of your show from entertainment to science?  Yes.  I'm glad you realized that.  We're a science show now.  Look, man, it was brutal, but the experiment is still flawed.  We're going to have to try a few different things still.  Hey, Seth, I got a question for you.  How long was Family Guy off the air before it came back on? 
[02:03:00]  Three whole years.  Wow.  Okay, that's encouraging.  What exactly was it that got you guys back on in the process that happened?  It actually, the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim attempted to buy the episodes for rebroadcast on Adult Swim,  and then they realized that it was going to be very successful.  So, they approached Fox about producing new episodes, and what really got us back on the air was that Fox released the first two seasons on DVD, 
[02:03:30]  and it sold ridiculously.  Okay.  And once that happened, Fox was like, oh my gosh, I guess we can make money off of this show that we never thought would make money.  So, they put us back on the air.  Excellent.  Yeah, Jimmy asked that because Lucky Louie got canceled, and Jimmy was a huge part of the show, obviously, on HBO,  and the DVD's being released.  In January.  And the show just shouldn't have been canceled.  They should have gave it another season.  It's tough, though, because TV nowadays, like, the stakes are so high with all the other means of broadcasting things,  and just how much the Internet is starting to catch on with, like, downloads and stuff. 
[02:04:00]  People are really not, people at the networks are not really willing to give things an opportunity.  It's like one episode they're giving some of these shows.  It's something like Smith.  Smith was only on for three shows.  Three shows.  Well, they aired us all 12 episodes, and the main problem was, I mean, a lot of people loved it.  A lot of people hated it, but a lot of the critics hated it.  We had, actually, a very good amount of viewers.  It was more just a – HBO's kind of – they were very used to critical acclaim, and this one critics hated, and I think that bothered them.  And some of it's the expense, you know, the expense of a show versus what it's returning and what the estimate it can make on DVD. 
[02:04:30]  There's so much more business in politics than you think.  I mean, lucky Louie had it costing the tenth of dollars.  Eight bucks an episode.  Wardrobe was garbage.  None of us are actors.  We're all just schlubs.  Sounds great.  My apologies, nonetheless.  Nobody likes getting canceled.  No.  So what are we promoting today there, Seth?  You know, the season finale of the second season of Robot Chicken is on this Sunday, and there's a telethon at the end of the episode where the other creator, Matt Stanreich, and I are soliciting funds for a third season. 
[02:05:00]  Nice.  They get a call in and give us money to take this show some more.  Do you know that Seth Green was named number seven of the top ten sexiest men of the Buffy Angel universe in a fan poll by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer fanzine?  I think there were only eight guys on the show.  I was going to say that.  Jesus Christ.  That's an insult.  My God.  It would be, except I never really put much stock in that.  Who'd you beat out? 
[02:05:30]  Who's right behind you?  Maybe Danny Strong.  I don't know.  I don't know who that is.  Thank God.  Seth is the voice of Chris Griffin on Family Guy.  Yeah, but it has to be written down for us.  We're going to work on bullet points.  Yeah, bullet points, and then the last bullet for Roland's big fat head.  Seth was among the guests at Jessica Simpson's 25th birthday party.  Hey, Seth.  Is that in my bio?  Yes.  Is that in my bio?  Hey, Seth, if you don't mind, I want to hand Roland your bio for a second. 
[02:06:00]  Here you go, Roland.  So, and maybe Roland, Roland, I want you to look at that bio for a second.  Take the headphones and ask Seth a question or two off that because that's what we're  supposed to work off of, and I would like you to look at that bio, and you have to have  headphones on so you can hear Mr. Green.  There you are, sweetie pie.  And maybe ask Seth a couple of questions and do an interview with him because he's here  to promote something.  Okay.  Are you guys trying to jump this guy in?  What's going on?  No, he's actually, he's here on the mic.  Jump him, man.  Yeah.  All right, man.  If you want to roll with us, go ahead and have interviews, man. 
[02:06:30]  I know it's going to be hard, but you're going to get the homies love after you ask the  right questions, man.  That's how we roll on radio.  We get jumped in.  All right, so we got Roland here with your bio, which is what we have to work off.  Okay, go ahead, Roland.  When are you going to start filming the Brazilian job?  Say that again?  When are you going to start filming the Brazilian job?  I'm missing the first part of the question, but I'm hearing Brazilian job.  He speaks so low, you cannot understand what he's saying.  This mic is cranked.  And he's a mush mouth.  Yeah, get right up on the mic and speak a little louder. 
[02:07:00]  When are you going to start filming the Brazilian job?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, no one cares about that.  They've had this movie in development for a couple of years now, but it's because we  did the first one, and now since it happened, everybody has gone and done other things.  It's like, you know, Charlize Theron won an Oscar, and Jason Statham's headlined a bunch  of movies, and Moe Steff got nominated for a Golden Globe, and Mark Wahlberg's a big  fat movie star, and I'm just out of their price range, so.  You know, I'd love to. 
[02:07:30]  It's true, though.  I read a draft not too long ago that was really good, and I don't know.  They're just working on getting it together, but they want it to be good, so.  Seth, Seth, Seth, Seth, Seth, Seth, fine, but you are thanked in the sleeve notes of Blink-180's  to Enema of the State.  Blink also thanks Idle Hands and Can't Hardly Wait, both movies featuring a Blink-182 song,  and coincidentally, both have Seth Green in them.  Yeah.  Roland.  What is Enema of the State, by the way?  I'm a little confused. 
[02:08:00]  It's exactly how it's written.  Enema?  It's a song.  Enema of the State, yes.  I thought it was Enemy of the State, no?  That's the movie, but this is the, was probably a parody on that name.  Boy, am I.  That's what we call in common day a pun.  Yeah, boy, am I.  Right.  Dummy.  Hey, Roland, there is a question that I want you to ask him, because that's kind of interesting.  It says, based on your Chris Griffith voice, it's based off of Buffalo Bill from Silence  of the Lambs.  Loosely, yeah.  Charlie Korsmo, who was in Can't Hardly Wait, and I were screwing around talking about Ted 
[02:08:30]  Levine and the part he played in Silence of the Lambs, and putting that guy in all sorts  of other jobs, like imagining him as a drive-thru attendant, and imagining him as a gas station  attendant, and I just made this laugh all day.  Yeah.  And then I had the audition for Family Guy, and I told Charlie I didn't have an idea for  the voice, and he was like, you should just do Ted Levine.  So I tried that, and they liked it, and I got that job.  It's the greatest, the greatest moment is when he's lurking in the door, and Jodie Foster's  asking about Frederica Bimmel, and he says, oh, wait a minute, was she a great big fat bird? 
[02:09:00]  And when he goes for the card, I think I got a card inside.  And then the way he drops the card and kind of, oh, runs away.  He half spins around the door.  He is fantastic.  He's a really underrated dramatic actor.  Yeah.  And that part that he played was just so definingly creepy that it, you know, it's unforgettable.  And the thing is... 
[02:09:30]  What better place for serious drama than in comedy?  Putting him in different situations.  Whenever you see him in another movie, it's just that guy in a different situation.  Well, he's not quite as affected in any other movie.  But, yeah, we thought it would be really hilarious.  We had him working at, like, McDonald's and working on the drive-thru.  Can I ask you a question?  I just want to know if you want a large soda with us.  Can I ask you a question?  I'm going to go ahead and make your cheeseburger. 
[02:10:00]  I just want to know if maybe you didn't want any onions on it.  And are you a size 7?  Did you see him in the, what was it, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes?  I didn't.  Yeah, he was in that, and just hysterical.  He's in, like, Heat.  You know, he's in a bunch of really good movies.  I just hear that voice, though, and it kills me every time.  It's like, ah, here's the guy.  Hey, Seth, we think these guys are just slipping into town and making their way out.  You are mistaken.  Someone stepped in, bang, bang. 
[02:10:30]  He didn't hesitate.  That's really good, man.  Seth, that's really good.  We're running out of show, unfortunately.  Yeah, damn it.  So we've got to give you the plug.  Well, let Seth Green do it as Chris Griffin.  All right.  Boom.  If you're one of the few morons who's not watching Robot Chicken, you should get your head surgically  removed from your anus and put your eyes in front of Adult Swim at 1130 on Sunday night.  Absolutely.  Season finale this Sunday night, and then you guys are doing a telethon, or is that just you? 
[02:11:00]  Just kidding.  You are doing it?  Yeah, well, that's the sketch in the episode.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Ow!  Oh, I just dropped the bio on my foot.  Oh, God damn it.  Hey, if you're serious about the t-shirts, I'm the, uh...  Oh, wait, wait.  Go ahead, Seth.  Sorry, I almost hung up on you.  What's up?  I said if you're serious about the t-shirts, the website will be back up in a week.  Yeah, what's the...  So the Robot Chicken website?  No, it's Adult Swim.com.  Uh, Adult Swim.com.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, uh, I pooped, uh, Rast.  They spell it R-A-S-T would be a...  I would wear that shirt all the time. 
[02:11:30]  I'll mention it.  All right.  Hey, Seth, it's always a pleasure.  Thank you so much.  Nice talking to you guys.  All right.  Take care, man.  Later, man.  Seth Green, everyone.  We're out of here for today.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have yourself a great day.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle hall away.  Whoa, hey.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall. 
[02:12:00]  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas  presents, and you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden buns is gonna get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless  shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:12:30]  Hey!  Hey!  We're here.  By the way, Monday is the day to do the walkover.  I just heard the promo.  It's much better than the promo.  Oh, yeah?  They're giving away so much shit on Monday to our fans.  It's not even fun.  Really?  What's the big thing, the coupon, Steve?  There's special deals on XM Radio, so we'll get the particular. 
[02:13:00]  See, we said special deals during the promo, but I'm hearing it's so special that we're  giving you a coupon, and for, like, $2, you can get an Inno.  That's more than a special deal.  This is, like, unheard of.  Is it $2 or $1.78 or something completely ridiculous?  We're gonna be just handing out certificates so you can get an Inno for, like, $2 or something  like that.  Nice.  No more than, like, $5 or $6.  Yeah, ridiculous.  I may actually want one of those.  The Innos are just amazing.  It's the only way to listen to XM.  Those are, like, the portable XMs?  Yeah, it's amazing. 
[02:13:30]  You can bring it to the gym.  It's all the rage.  Because, I mean, the MiFi's are really cool, but the technology's gotten better, and these  Innos are, like, half the size, maybe a third of the size of a MiFi.  And on Monday's walkover, Steve's getting the actual price, but I heard, like, the certificates  we're handing out on Monday, it's, like, for an Inno for, like, $2.  That's ridiculous.  That is insane.  You can completely upgrade your XM unit.  Oh, look at that.  I have one at home, actually.  Of course, Flea has one.  I know he does.  These are actually really cool.  It's a little thicker than a credit card, but it's the same length and width as a credit 
[02:14:00]  card.  That's $200 off the retail price of an Inno.  That's what the coupons are for.  He actually tapped me and took it back.  What, am I going to steal it?  Relax.  Jesus, Flea.  He tapped me.  Oh, okay.  Wait, $200 off, but how much does an Inno cost?  That's what I'm getting at.  That puts it at $179 total.  $179?  Yeah, for Inno.  Oh, I'm thinking $1.79.  Forget it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, forget it.  All right, don't show up.  Don't show up on Monday.  Why?  That's still a great deal, man.  An Inno for $179?  Yeah, but it was just $2. 
[02:14:30]  Oh.  So now it seems like, you know.  Someone gave me wrong info.  I swear to God, someone told me $1.  That's why, like $1.78, $1.79.  Yeah.  That's still good, but that's, you know, it's pricey for some.  I was thinking, like, a bunch of the fans could get them literally for free.  That would be, like, a really smart marketing ploy.  I wish we didn't clarify it and that Steve had to pay the difference out of his check.  But it's still worth coming here.  Out of my own salary.  It's still worth coming on the walkover on Monday because we will have a ton of stuff  to give away.  Lots and lots of things. 
[02:15:00]  So tell your friends.  We want to see a huge crowd on Monday.  Something else going on, Anthony and Jimmy.  Our own Craig has cut the line.  He is first on line to get a PS3.  What?  But he's going to have to wait until what?  Midnight or tomorrow?  How did he cut the line, though?  How did he cut the line?  Without them killing him.  Well, I want to go down there because it's at the Sony store.  You can't make it that far.  The mics won't make it past Fifth Avenue, right?  Nope.  Dude, I'm telling you right now.  We've got to get someone down there with a cell phone or something.  I will pay $1,000 for a PS3. 
[02:15:30]  $1,000.  But you have to get it to me before we get off the air in the next couple hours.  And then what I'll do after I hand you $1,000 for the PS3, I'm going to walk to one of these  lines.  I'm going to go right to the front of the line.  I'm going to show everyone the PS3.  And then I'm going to proceed to take a sledgehammer and smash it in front of everybody.  Fucking...  I can't...  Someone bring one down.  And then XM and CBS will fight over who actually has to pay the $1,000. 
[02:16:00]  And then it will be taken down.  Yeah, right.  I want to smash it right in front of everybody.  But Craig is online.  Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.  Yes, she had some...  She had some bouncers.  Biggins.  Hey, who are you, sir?  Who are you?  Talk to that guy, Jimmy.  He's out here all the time.  He's out here every day.  Yeah.  Do we talk to him?  Okay.  He's out every day.  How are you, sir? 
[02:16:30]  Oh.  He's a regular...  Oh, Danny.  He almost bumped into that mountain.  Sorry.  So...  Hi, miss.  You anticipating the rain?  No.  AIDS.  When we get on XM, we'll call Craig to see how he's doing online.  How did he cut the fucking line?  I don't know.  Where's Sam?  Sam knows.  How did he cut the line, Sam?  Sam, how did he do it?  He just told people that he was interviewing people.  And then just literally went through the entire crowd walking through.  Stepping over chairs. 
[02:17:00]  And then he just kind of said, okay, thanks.  And stayed at the front of the line.  And no one's kicking him out?  Not yet.  He said he's worried about security, but...  What do you mean he's worried about security?  What security?  I just called him.  And he said that...  I asked him how long.  I think he thinks he can wait.  But he said that as long as...  Until security finds him.  Finds him?  He's at the front of the line.  Yeah, he's number one.  He's number one?  He's number one right now.  Is that one of the stores where they're going to sell him at midnight?  Or does he have to wait until tomorrow morning? 
[02:17:30]  They haven't given out certificates yet.  They're giving out certificates at nine, I think.  Hey, don't bend that.  Don't bend it.  Big sign in there.  Do not bend.  That was really funny.  That's a visual.  What the fuck are you going to do?  That's a nice visual, but it was very funny.  All right.  Well, we'll talk to Craig in a little while.  Yeah, we'll have to get someone down there with a cell phone.  Because the mics won't make it.  How can we get a PS3?  I'm serious.  I don't know.  Steal one.  What about our pals that love us from around the corner?  RCS? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, we did live broadcast for them.  Ah, yeah.  Do we have a connection?  Can we call them?  I don't know how that friendship will go when a lot of money's at stake.  What are you talking about?  I'm paying for the PSP.  I just need one of these people to just bring it down.  Call them.  Try to go to 8th.  Oh, you want to try to go to 8th?  There's another line on 8th.  Where?  At the store you shop at, eh?  Oh, up there?  Never make it there.  Comp USA?  Comp USA? 
[02:18:30]  There's a line there?  That's 8th and 57th, right?  What are we going to do when we get there?  I don't know.  We're just going to talk to people and hear nonsense from people with bad...  Whoa!  Hey!  Whoa!  Hey!  Oh, he's mad.  He's mad, too.  He's mad.  Oh, he told you, man.  Oh, he's pulling over, too.  Let's find out what happened.  Yeah, what happened?  Okay, want to go find out?  Talk to the cabbie and see what happens.  Yeah, go ahead.  All right.  Hurry, talk to that savage.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.  Sir, what happened with that lady?  Why was she so mad? 
[02:19:00]  She's because of the traffic.  Huh?  She said because of the traffic she had to go to her and then...  She's mad at you for the traffic?  Yes.  Oh, what a bitch.  You ought to drive on the sidewalk and run her over.  Pardon my language, ladies.  Oh, okay.  I like this cabbie.  He actually talked to us.  All right, thank you.  She just ran away to talk to the cabbie.  She ran into the traffic.  All right, thank you.  All right, Clarence Williams III.  I appreciate that.  Did Madonna adopt your son?  Oh, Madonna wants another one.  She's making a chess set.  She needs another rook. 
[02:19:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Look who that is.  Who is that?  I don't know, but she's old and she's dressed like I should know her.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, that guy looks like Laszlo.  Yeah, who is that?  Oh, it is Laszlo.  Of course it is.  Laszlo, could you get me a PSP 3?  I want to smash a PSP 3 in front of everybody.  A PS3.  I can see if I can grab you one.  A PS3.  I keep saying PSP.  We've got some people in front of Best Buy, in front of Rockstar that have been there since  Monday.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  No, I need someone inside the store to help me out and give it to me now.  Although they're still waiting on line.  You want to smash it like when it comes out?  No, I want to smash it while they're waiting on line.  That's a good vibe.  It is a good vibe, man.  That ain't gonna happen.  Once you get it, it's just gonna overheat anyway.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They run a little hot.  They run a little hot, do they?  Yeah.  Do they get warm in your hand and shit?  Do you get a hold of them?  They'll cook the room.  Wow.  From what I've heard.  See?  So wait for the second generation?  They're trying to fit all that computer graphic technology into a box.  I don't even know how many games are out for it. 
[02:20:30]  Three?  Yeah, three games are out for it.  Exactly.  Some of the old games, you can't play on it.  I just can't believe people would wait for days and days, sitting outside in the rain  for a video game system.  Exactly.  They're douchebags, aren't they?  They just want attention.  I know.  They want the media to talk to them.  I'd love to run through a fucking super soaker full of gas, and then have somebody run through  a match.  You know how the news would react if you set a line full of people on fire?  Good morning, ma'am.  How are you?  I held that old blood.  Why did you win a medal, ma'am? 
[02:21:00]  It's all cut and hit loss.  What did she win the medal for?  Ugliness.  Oh, she's awful.  Hitler gave it to her for the Olympics.  Be nice to the old lady.  I think a PlayStation 3 would be great.  You go to one of these stores where there's a line, but you do a little acting.  Yeah?  I think come out and go, yeah, look at the whole crowd sack that you got one, and then  trip and fall and throw it as somebody with a car runs it over. 
[02:21:30]  So it looks like it happened accidentally.  All in one take?  Yes, one take.  And it wants a four-camera shoot.  It's going to be hard.  A pratfall.  Right.  You need a pratfall and a stuntman.  All right.  Well, it ain't going to happen, so why talk about it?  Who's shitting who?  A guy in a beautiful Porsche yelling, wah-wah penis.  Wah-wah penis out of a red Porsche. 
[02:22:00]  Now the light's changed or we'd run out.  No, let's just wait.  Let's just...  What?  I feel okay.  We're actually talking again.  I'm hoping we get back.  Thank you, sir.  Very concerned about your relationship.  Yeah, he's a good boy.  I was just trying to keep him there so people honked at him.  I love honkers.  And they did.  Look at those glasses.  The cab driver was angry.  You look stupid.  Those were awful. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  Just bright yellow frames.  What a fool.  Hi.  Young go-getter.  In his suit.  That was really funny.  You look stupid.  I didn't mean that shit.  The wall of ads.  Nothing new.  Nothing fun to talk about.  Oh, my God.  Look at the bunt on this guy.  Oh, my God.  How are you?  How about a sit-up?  Oh, God.  By the way, we got some food coming.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  A friend of mine made some muffins.  And we'll be bringing them down.  And you may remember her.  She brought a cake.  Oh, that awful cake.  She's made some muffins.  No way.  That she's bringing down.  No way.  Thank God.  Andrea.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  So we'll have some muffins for all.  I don't know how many muffins.  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  I do.  I do.  Probably is a head.  He said you wouldn't want to know.  Could he pull those Wranglers any higher?  What an awful ass that guy has. 
[02:23:30]  Two fucking mushy lima beans.  Jesus, look at that fucking svelte bottom.  An Asian bottom.  Smooth bottom boy walking by.  Fucking twink.  There's nothing else, right?  Yeah, except for this monster.  No bra here.  No, she has a bra.  She just has such fat, heavy birthing nipples.  That they're fucking going to poke through.  She could be wearing a fucking...  The thing that they throw over your chest when they do dental x-rays.  And her nipples would poke through it. 
[02:24:00]  Old fucking radiation protector.  Big fat baby suckling nipples.  Great nipples.  Notice how we all shut up.  All right.  Anyone else?  Say something about the guy pushing the garbage pile.  Anyone else?  He should be living in it.  Fuck him.  Hey, Yatakoto.  Wow.  I think we're done.  Yeah, I think we're done here.  We'll see you upstairs.  Yep.  Opie and Anthony.  XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:24:30]  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd. 
[02:25:00]  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town hall PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[02:25:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we'll get the show on.  We will be back to you.  By the time we're going in and out.  We'll be back to you.  Good night.  We're out.  Behind me. 
[02:26:00]  We'll be back to you.  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:27:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:27:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, I'd love to hear it.  What's going on?  I have no headphones.  If this happens again, someone gets fired.  Yeah?  Yep.  That's all I'm saying.  What if Jimmy does it?  And I have to fire Jimmy?  I don't want to get fired.  I'll deport him.  Craig, tell us what happened.  Nothing's happening right now.  Just supposedly...  Don't have full volume on my head.  Get away from me. 
[02:28:30]  What happened?  Christ, it blew his ears out.  Just fucking blew my ears out, too.  No, it didn't, because you still got the wax in there.  Thank God.  Craig, what's going on?  See?  At 9 o'clock, they're supposedly going inside the Sony store to watch, like, Ludacris Post with Charlie Murphy.  And security just walked by, and he just looked at me and just walked away.  Okay.  Well, Ludacris and Charlie, all right, cool.  So we know what they're going after the young white college audience.  Yeah, we noticed that. 
[02:29:00]  They're paying the homeless to wait in line.  No, they kicked those people out.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  What time does the store open, sweetie?  The store opens at 9 p.m.  9 tonight?  Yeah, 9 tonight, the store opens.  Then they get to walk inside, and, like, the first 10 people get, like, a free controller.  Then they've been handing out free seats, t-shirts, hats. 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  It's mayhem.  Wait, what store are you at?  I'm at the Sony store.  And they're all closed all day?  Yeah.  Why would they give up a whole day of business?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Everybody's waiting outside.  There's an actual sign that says, line for PlayStation 3 begins here.  Or a PS3 event.  You could go in there.  Oh, okay.  And shop.  Go in there and buy a PS3.  And grease a guy for a PS3, I'm sure.  You have to grease them. 
[02:30:00]  They probably have everyone accounted for it.  I bet.  So, basically, nothing's going to happen on this line with you, Craig, huh?  Let's be honest.  Probably not.  No, because I'm standing here with the top 10 guys.  Yeah.  And I talked to one kid before, and he's like, so what are you trying to do?  I'm like, well, I want a PS3.  Right.  He's like, oh, you're skipping the line?  I'm like, yeah, why not?  You'll get yours before mine.  Yeah.  And he's like, no, you can't do that.  So, once security comes out here and...  What happened?  Oh, he's talking, and then he'll realize... 
[02:30:30]  What happened?  ...that his bit went nowhere.  All right, listen.  I like the fact he went down there, though.  I like that, Craig kid.  We like Craig.  Mike in Milwaukee.  Hey, Opie, I don't know how XM thinks they're saving the fans tons of money on the walkover.  Or you can get an Inno at MyRadioStore.com for $179 right now.  I heard that they were pretty much giving away Innos on the walkover on Monday.  Well, let's get Steve in here, because there may be...  We had a big fan come down opportunity.  So, it's... 
[02:31:00]  Well, a lot of people will show up on Monday for the walkover, because they are going to  have, like, t-shirts and all sorts of stuff for everybody.  But I heard that they were doing an unbelievable deal for the Innos on Monday.  I'm actually making a big announcement on Monday.  Monday.  Are you?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Leaving the show?  Oh, uh...  No, why'd you say that happily?  Happily.  Who are you on the board?  Fucking cocksuckers. 
[02:31:30]  No shit, dude.  I'm right with you.  Oh, but they all love Anthony.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  I like so-and-so.  He brings the funny.  Does he really?  Fat girl fucking way of speaking?  Anthony can't do no wrong.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Um...  Now, what's the deal?  Seriously.  What, baby?  $200 off on the Innos?  I don't know.  Let's get fucking...  I want an answer.  $200 off.  Should we get Don on the phone? 
[02:32:00]  I say we get Elo.  Elo?  Yeah.  He loves me.  He said it on the machine.  Elo, who doesn't call me back?  He called me back.  In my time of crisis?  Who are you talking to, Steve?  I've got Don on the phone.  What's the deal?  It doesn't sound like a great thing.  It stinks.  It's a great deal, but it stinks as a promotion.  Because you can get them at my radio store.  Yeah, what's the deal, Steve?  The deal is for $200 off the retail price of an Inno.  So if an Inno minus $200 is $179, that's what it costs. 
[02:32:30]  Then why don't we knock off $300 to get people down?  Because you can go to myradiostore.com and get them for $179.  That's a great deal.  But why would anybody come out and stand in the possible rain to get a coupon for what they can order now?  I don't get it.  It's an excellent point, Jim.  Explain that to me.  Quickly, quickly.  I can't.  That was me being take charge.  Okay.  So they're still going to pay $179?  Yeah.  I'm just trying to save the listeners some more money.  Of course that's what we're doing.  Guys, someone gave me the wrong info.  And I apologize.  Someone told me with this certificate they were handing out, it was going to be like $1.79. 
[02:33:00]  Are you sure they didn't say $179?  Are you sure they didn't say $179 and you missed what it was good?  So someone didn't have, you know, erroneous information.  That's all right.  I mean, it's still a nice deal.  Don't get me wrong, but it's a lot different than what I heard at the time.  Not so much filthy lies around this place.  What else is going on?  We got new virus t-shirts.  We got, like, girls in hot pants coming down from headquarters, I think.  Hot pants.  Or whatever, Monday.  Whatever their kids are calling them these days. 
[02:33:30]  Whatever they're called.  Hot pants.  Girl shorts.  Hot pants.  I'm touching my nipples thinking about the headquarters girls.  Yeah, they're coming down on Monday.  Fucking lovely.  Well, there's one girl there who actually took the cover photo with me whose ass was so nice.  No, no, no.  We can't do this today.  No, Jimmy.  Don't.  Please.  Don't do it.  And.  And. 
[02:34:00]  I've wanted to see her soon.  All right, let's go to Sarah in Louisiana.  Sarah.  Yeah.  Sarah.  Hey, Sarah.  Hi, how are y'all?  Good.  Hi.  Hey, listen, I'm just calling to give y'all a woman kind of point of view about the name system.  All right.  We always like the woman's point of view on things.  That's right.  I know because y'all are just such a fabulous, feministic type of show.  Yes.  But I just.  But I just wanted to say that gaming is for absolute losers that can't play the real world. 
[02:34:30]  It just drives me.  Freaking bananas.  And I can't stand men that sit around and play these video systems or camp out for these lame game systems.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Let me ask you a question.  Are you married?  Yes, I'm married.  And your husband plays too many video games instead of fucking you.  Is that correct?  No.  No?  Okay.  Wouldn't think of it.  I wouldn't have married him.  I wouldn't have married a game nerd.  A game nerd.  A game nerd.  What do you, what, what, why are you so annoyed at them? 
[02:35:00]  Why do men play Tiger Woods golf?  Because they can't play it in the real world.  Why do men play MVP baseball?  Let me tell you something.  Why do men box?  Because we get arrested for hitting you.  Let me tell you something there, Sarah.  I actually play Tiger Woods golf.  Yeah.  And I'm, and I've been known to, I've, I've been known to, to shoot some numbers on, on a real golf course.  Well, then why not just go do that?  I do.  Well, you can't every day.  When you're on a flight that's over three, four hours and you got a PSP in your hand, it makes sense to me to play a little Tiger Woods golf. 
[02:35:30]  And if you want to play Medal of Honor, why don't we just go out and shoot people?  Right.  It's like, you know.  No, if you want to play Medal of Honor, just go join the military.  But Sarah, see, that's a little extreme.  If you want to be a soldier, if you want to be a soldier, go join the military.  I agree with you.  Sarah, hold on.  All right.  I hate gaming.  Although, but Anthony plays it.  Oh, my God.  And Anthony's not a zero.  Thank you.  I mean, honestly, I mean, I would love to tell you you're a zero, but you're not.  I mean, you're a guy I know well enough.  But he is a shut-in.  Anthony's a shut-in and a psychopath. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  But he's not a zero.  So, thank you.  I do agree with you that the game stinks, though, Sarah.  But, again, why don't you just use that logic and say, why do people watch movies instead  of just going out and living a romantic comedy?  It's kind of a dumb argument.  Using her logic, she wants Anthony to run around in the woods somewhere with a bunch  of fairies.  It's just a...  No.  I don't mean what works with him.  No.  I completely understand if you play games in a leisure-type manner.  But when you're camping out for days waiting on a game system, you're over the edge.  You need to come back to reality.  I would never do that. 
[02:36:30]  She's right.  Sarah, what else don't you allow...  That's a loser.  Sarah, what else do you not let your husband do?  Well, I don't ever restrict my husband.  He can do what he pleases.  Oh, that's right.  He's a grown man.  I'm a grown woman.  What if he wanted to start playing video games?  If he wanted to play video games, you can play it at a leisure.  You don't have to be at an hour.  Leisure means your time, the time you allow him to play it, right?  It doesn't mean my time.  By the way, I absolutely loved your show about men's vacations.  I found that very interesting. 
[02:37:00]  The men-cations.  The men-cations.  The men-cations.  That was fabulous.  You guys are just absolutely fabulous.  Sarah, the reviews on your phone call are coming in.  All right.  I like her.  Oh, Lord.  Mixed reviews.  She's got spunk.  I like Sarah.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Mixed reviews coming in.  Well, I love y'all.  Will you shut the fuck up?  She loves us, y'all.  Enough!  It's time for a man to talk.  Someone go for it.  Some men are going to do some talking. 
[02:37:30]  Holy shit.  Y'all can't handle me is what the problem is.  Yeah.  Thank God we don't have to handle you.  How's that?  Well, thank God.  But also, I mean, I'm just stunned that more women don't call in about your shows.  I heard that one show about your wife gaining like 50 pounds over a 10-year period, and you  need to ditch her.  I'm not saying that I excuse what is going on.  No woman should gain any excessive amount of weight during a marriage.  You do sign up for what you get in the initial contract. 
[02:38:00]  But at the same time, men don't keep their figure either.  And you have to be more objective.  Anthony, the reviews on Sarah's phone call are coming in.  Oh, Lord.  We got Bill from Waterford.  They're mixed reviews, but let's read a few of these.  Sarah is a fun-killing video game cunt.  Go fuck yourself with a joystick video game fun ruiner.  Dan from Queensbury.  Don't send feedback for a minute, guys. 
[02:38:30]  I got to read some of these.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I have to go back a page, Anthony.  How do I do that?  Like that.  Like that?  All right.  Like that?  Dan from Queensbury.  Ask Sarah if I can play cunt puncher 2K6.  I'm with Sarah.  I'm with Sarah.  Mixed reviews.  No kin to a monkey from Michigan writes, tell this cunt to lick my asshole while I play Halo.  More mixed reviews coming in from someone's cell phone. 
[02:39:00]  It just says, cunt.  What, Sarah?  You know what?  They wouldn't be this vindictive.  RJ from Columbus, Ohio has this to say about Sarah.  Hurry, mixed reviews.  Yeah.  Shit.  RJ writes, why do men jerk off?  Because their bitches don't know how to fuck properly.  You know?  Ty from Marilyn says, I bet if this cunt's husband got her a $3,000 ring, she'd shit her pants.  People pay money for games, and she's losing her pudding-filled mind. 
[02:39:30]  Whatever.  I think that, hold on, Sarah.  You're a shame, loser.  They're giving Sarah a hard time when she's being an aggressive woman and saying that you should be deep-dicking your woman instead of fucking sitting there on a computer, and I don't disagree with her.  More mixed reviews coming, though, Jimmy.  It's on Foxman 50-50.  Yeah, 50-50.  The pile driver.  Rob from Houston.  Sounds like her husband needs to go out and buy the game called Kill the Cunt. 
[02:40:00]  Patman from Foxborough.  Platform is that on.  Tell this bitch to shut up.  Most people that are waiting in line are selling their PS3s on eBay for $3,000.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I know.  Shut up.  Oh, no.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  That's who I am.  Obviously, my husband is fucking happy and sexy.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Shut up. 
[02:40:30]  Goddamn rich cunt.  Shut up.  More mixed reviews.  Adam from Freehold.  This woman needs a dick in her mouth to shut her the fuck up.  I like her.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Where are the mixed reviews?  You're only saying one fucking side.  Where's the mixed reviews?  You're too fucking fucked for me, Missy.  You're right, Sarah.  Quit doing your mouth about the negative fucking side.  Show the other side.  Good point, Sarah.  I'm with you.  I'm doing mixed reviews.  You like that game?  You're not going to be able to fucking handle me.  Hey, do you like the game? 
[02:41:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Do you like the game Duck Hunt?  Is that what your husband says when he throws something at you?  Duck Hunt.  More mixed reviews coming in, Anthony.  Yes.  Ramone, tell this cunt's husband to bash her head in with a PS3.  Time for Marilyn.  Well, Pat from Trenton, New Jersey.  Sarah's a cunt with a capital C.  Let's see. 
[02:41:30]  That is the only word you're uneducated male.  Aaron.  Exactly.  I'd rather come in my own face than wait longer than an hour for a fucking video game system.  There you go.  There's one for you there.  I agree with Sarah that if you're sitting out there waiting for a video game, you are  a bag of shit.  If you're going to play it.  A fricking loser.  A loser.  I think the video game, you want to spend a couple hours playing fine.  But anyone that dedicates their life to it, you should be deep dicking your broad.  Face first. 
[02:42:00]  She put her face there.  You straddle her legs from the outside and you give her a nice, thick, deep dicking.  Well, Mark from the Bronx, Sarah should suck her husband's cock more so he doesn't have  to keep visiting 15-year-old Thai whores.  I bet she does suck a hundred cock.  How do you like them apples?  I hear you.  This is running, running, running your mouth.  Ooh.  Shit.  You're frustrating me.  You're not even listening.  I'm not saying don't play games in leisure.  I'm telling men who are sitting outside the floor in my life.  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays. 
[02:42:30]  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping.  That's right.  Damone.  He knows.  Steve from Albany.  This cunt probably drags her husband to chip flicks on Sunday so he doesn't get to watch  the big game.  Why would you think I...  My husband is very independent.  I believe in a mutual marriage respect.  I'm independent.  He is independent.  You need to find yourself a real bitch like me.  And then you'll know that women are out for your blood.  All I'm trying to tell you and all your male audience is if you're camped out waiting 
[02:43:00]  for...  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Quiet.  Stop whining.  I've listened to it for like three weeks straight.  You're so pig-headed and negative.  And then when a woman does call in to tell you it's you...  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm on your side, Sarah.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Hey, I've been nice to you.  Don't whatever me, you fucking hole with teeth.  I've been fucking... 
[02:43:30]  The only one going to bat for you.  And you're gonna whatever me, you emasculating piglet.  I'll give your mouth a...  Jim sure can swing.  I'll give you a good fucking gonorrhea throat fuck.  Stupid.  Don't fucking whatever me when I'm on your side.  Shut up.  Ooh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  I had to play a video game called  Give You a Tea Bagging  and make you smell onions for the next 12 hours. 
[02:44:00]  How'd you like a nice fucking oniony ball bag  on your nose bridge?  Straighten you right out, Missy.  I'm telling you, you all are just so classically educated.  I love it.  We're educated.  Listen to you, you fucking hillbilly.  You ought to be watching Hee Haw with a fist up your cunt.  Of course, that's your Yankee dumbass mentality  about the South.  You're calling, well, listen to you, you dope.  You don't sound like a surgeon.  Well, sounds like we got to go in through the top of the head.  Shut your face, stupid.  Shut up.  Okay.  Fucking kneel down in your trailer 
[02:44:30]  and service whatever relative you're married to.  What do you think of them apples?  I like them apples.  I was trying to be nice to you,  and you brought out the ugliness.  Yes, right.  Nobody could bring out the ugliness out of you.  He was?  Exactly, because there is no ugliness.  It's all flowers.  You know why I'd like to stand on line for three hours  to watch people fish into your vagina  and call it noodling.  I'd like to go noodling in your vagina  with Freddy Krueger gloves on.  What do you think of them apples?  You fucking no loyalty to the only guy defending you twat. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, you didn't even realize he was defending you.  Completely.  I like to rub a salty booger on your lips  and then give your nose a little tweak-a-roo.  If he was defending me,  he would have already read some responses that agree with me.  First of all, we're two different people.  That's Opie.  I'm Jim Norton, you fucking dummy.  Opie was reading the feedback.  I'm across the room.  I don't have fucking eagle vision.  Although I wish I had an eagle beak  so I could snip your clit off and spit it at you.  I want to snip off your clit 
[02:45:30]  and then sit on a dollar bill and spit it at you.  Opie, dear, are you the twerp  with the little pubic hair going around your chin  or are you the blonde with the shit face?  Well, if you don't listen to the show for three weeks,  there's three of us.  Anthony is the one with the pubic hair.  I have the pubic hair.  An opity, opity, opity.  It really is hard to say.  Sarah, are you trying to say I'm ugly?  Well, which one are you?  He's the blonde-haired god.  Are you actually trying to say that I am ugly? 
[02:46:00]  No, I am not trying to say you're ugly.  You dope.  You're stupid.  She was very badly raped, you see?  Wouldn't we love to see that?  No, she's dead.  Here's Kevin from Connecticut, a positive one for Sarah.  I like Sarah, but then again,  I also like shaping animals out of poo.  What do you think of that?  You're a shit rhino.  It's well-wasted.  Quiet, shit rhino. 
[02:46:30]  Some men are talking.  To the guys out there,  someone is married to this bitch.  Someone has...  I bet your husband is such a henpeck.  Do you strap it on and give him a good fuck  if he doesn't work enough overtime?  Do you rape his bottom with a strap on?  Shut up, Paul.  I'm not going to have you disrespect my husband who would...  Ah, your husband's a fucking seed drinker.  He loves nothing more than to pinch the ball vein of a man  and squirt that seed down his own throat.  That's what your husband does,  and then he touches your kids inappropriately.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock. 
[02:47:00]  The last time I'm going to ask you...  Sarah, you do know that your husband is cheating on you, right?  Yes, he is.  You do know that, right?  He's cheating on me.  He absolutely is, too.  He's just good at hiding it.  With a Laotian boy.  He is absolutely cheating on you.  No one can handle you, sir.  You're an obnoxious mess.  Do you realize that the...  I love listening to you all  because I just get this fabulous view  of what men are really thinking.  Exactly.  We think you're dumb.  Your husband's thinking the same thing, sweetie. 
[02:47:30]  Your husband's thinking the same thing.  Yep.  You just think he's thinking differently.  He's thinking the same thing,  that you are indeed a cunt.  And he's fucking somebody behind your back.  Right now, he's rubbing scented oils  onto the washboard abs of a young Thai boy.  Perhaps a 13 or 14-year-old.  He's rubbing scented oil onto the boy's belly.  Hello, exactly!  And the boy doesn't speak good English,  so he just kicks out his feet and goes,  aha, aha, and makes some dumb Asian noise. 
[02:48:00]  I'm trying to kiss you on the mouth.  Sarah?  You're getting a reaction, though.  Ash...  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  She hung up.  Did she?  I swear to God, she hung up.  I know you didn't.  Why?  I was going to Ashley,  and I swear to God, she hung up.  But she's still listening.  Poor Sarah couldn't take it.  Ashley from Kansas City, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to call in and say,  if you guys let this bitch jab her on for two more minutes,  I'm going to have to stab her in her eye with my stiletto.  She is not indicative of all women,  and she is just...  She needs to be off there.  I'm glad she hung up. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, let's get into this a little bit.  What is that broad all about?  She's just a dope...  I don't know.  I actually like...  I don't know, but I guarantee she's in a sexless marriage,  and her husband is fucking a little blonde girl on the side.  Yeah, something's going on there,  because, look, yes, I like an opinionated woman.  I like a woman that speaks up a bit.  Sure, absolutely.  But there's something going on in that girl's world.  Her husband has never said to her,  just shut your mouth, bitch.  Right.  Shut up.  All right.  She needs a good smack right across the face,  and I'm all about women's rights,  but she's an ignorant. 
[02:49:00]  The right to be punched.  She is one of these women who likes to let everyone know she's in charge.  Not even in the privacy of the home,  or it's like, you know,  bash the husband around a little bit,  tell him what to do.  This is one of those, like, at family functions  and out at a party or something,  she's always lambasting the husband.  Just, what do you do?  Oh, you know what he's like.  Oh, the old idiot.  Let me tell you what this jackass did the other day.  That's what she's all about. 
[02:49:30]  Just emasculating her man.  And meanwhile, he's sprinkling glass into her food,  like fucking they did to Tony Masanti in the first season of Oz.  I hope she shits a lot of blood and wonders why.  But not even good, solid blood shits.  No.  But the type that go,  and spray the toilet with blood,  like it's a fucking paintball accident.  That's what I hope.  I hope you're taking a bleeding, loud shit.  What do you think of them apples? 
[02:50:00]  The back of her bowl looks like spin art.  Hey, Ashley, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Punching out.  That woman was a little too much, to be honest.  And Jimmy was actually defending her,  but that stupid twat couldn't even hear it.  She couldn't hear beyond a man's voice.  Just the voice must have meant that you didn't like her because you're a man.  So she had to jump back tenfold and try to give it back to you with her sass. 
[02:50:30]  It just shows you the virus is spreading because it's spreading to people.  What happens is with this show, you enjoy what we do,  and then you tell people about it,  and they don't have the same sense of humor as you,  so they don't like it.  So then they start listening, and they just hate it,  and then they can't help themselves, and they've got to call the show.  The worst thing is to do a show that people just don't care about.  Like you tell somebody about a show, and they tune in,  and you go, oh, yeah, I kind of listen to it. 
[02:51:00]  I think I don't remember much about it or something.  But when friends who really like the show, friends of the show,  tell other people, and they despise this program,  they are better fans than the ones that really enjoy it.  Right.  That fucking twat will listen to every word we utter.  Every word.  And I hope she calls back.  Douchebag listener from Wackbag.  Yeah, we can't let you off the hook on this one, Ant.  Did you guys hear Ant's sounds of disgust when Obi said,  I like an opinionated woman. 
[02:51:30]  Pretty funny.  Oh, yeah, because I know you're just lying.  I'm not.  Absolutely not.  Who likes an opinionated woman?  Isn't that like bitchy?  Isn't opinionated a good word for bitchy?  No, it's a woman with opinions.  Smart and wise.  But opinionated has a negative connotation to it.  It sounds like, oh, she's opinionated.  Who has her opinions? 
[02:52:00]  That should be heard.  Yeah.  Every woman has opinions.  So what's one opinionated?  Hey, they're like assholes, opinions.  That's right.  Yeah, they stink.  All right, we got another broad on the line that hates Sarah.  Sometimes there's blood on them.  Tammy.  Yes?  You're a broad, right?  What was that?  You're a broad and you're happy to be a broad, right?  That's right.  And I'm broad and I'm beautiful and she's pissing me off.  If she's going to dish it out, she needs to be able to take it.  Right. 
[02:52:30]  Dish out the blowjobs and take the cocks in the ass.  You're right.  That's right.  And my husband plays games and he works and he can play games whenever he wants.  No big deal.  But he also is not sitting in line at Best Buy this morning waiting for a game.  No.  Look, man.  You know, to say that all gamers are losers is so stupid.  Only 99%.  I really do believe that people online waiting for a PS3 are losers.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Or criminals.  Karen needs to listen to the Oprah show, not y'all show, because apparently she's not 
[02:53:00]  cut out for this program, so.  All right.  Yeah.  But she's still listening right now.  Oh, she's right now.  She is listening.  Yeah.  What do you have to say to her, Tammy?  She's listening.  She can't help herself.  Well, she called in and she's, you know, all self-righteous and everything and saying  how she loves you guys.  But once the tables turn and she's all pissed off and she's cussing everybody out, I just  don't think.  I think she needs to get a life.  All right.  Get a life, you told her. 
[02:53:30]  They're easy with the harsh statements.  Should she buzz off as well?  Hey, this is the, you know, Joe makes a good point.  Thank you, Tammy.  We've got to let you go.  Joe from Whackbag.  I guarantee that she's going to go and tell her husband that he's not allowed to listen  to the show anymore.  Yeah.  That happens a lot, actually, with this show.  But she'll still listen.  But she won't allow her husband to listen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  We should take a break.  When we get back, some trick.  Cops bust Halloween Osama dresser.  What? 
[02:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Well, you've got to stick around to find out.  But I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  You're doing like a news tease.  Well, yeah.  Osama in your neighborhood will tell you about it.  This guy is a class actor.  It's hilarious.  It's a good story, yeah.  All right.  Looking forward to hearing it.  Even though we already have your money, we'll tease you with that.  Jimmy's eating fruit.  Fruit.  I want to chew on a Piddle Little today. 
[02:54:30]  That's my new favorite.  Piddle Little.  I want to chew on a Piddle Little.  With those pits with the fuzzies that come from the shape of your teeth.  I love it.  Like bitten off of it.  Green olives.  And then you chew on the Piddle Little.  Where's my olives?  Yeah.  Can we eat some olives?  I want to throw olives in my oatmeal.  Olives?  Ew.  No way are you putting olives in oatmeal.  Why not?  Because oatmeal needs sweet stuff in it.  Get my olives.  Yeah, we need olives so we can chew on a Piddle Little.  I want to chew on a Piddle Little. 
[02:55:00]  I'll chew on a Piddle Little.  Piddle Little.  It's the dumbest thing that makes me laugh at this film.  All right.  Ooh, olives coming up.  Listen to this.  The sound of olives.  Ooh, careful.  Careful.  Mmm.  Ooh.  Are we in break?  Yeah.  Yeah, we went to break a little while ago.  So we could just sit around and do nothing.  Oh, God.  I'm so tired from that meeting last night. 
[02:55:30]  We got some other meeting now after the show today.  Not me.  That sucks.  I got to go home and wait for cable.  What's the show meeting about today?  Can't we just cancel that in lieu of the meeting that we have to take?  I mean, really?  What the fuck?  Someone's getting pissed off.  Scarecrow from Houston.  Opie sitting in line for two days to resell a PS3 for two or three grand.  Maybe a pay cut for you, but it's pretty nice for others.  Just chill, dude. 
[02:56:00]  I'm sure there's some that are making money off it, but in general, the people waiting  on line are just losers.  Good luck, by the way, getting that money.  It's like it's a done deal.  All right.  How did it work when you bought all those Furbies?  How'd that work for you?  Yeah, that's good.  How did the Tickle Me Elmo work for you?  It's like the people that get in at the ass end of the pyramid schemes.  You're so right.  And get nothing.  By late tomorrow, there are going to be so many PS3s on eBay, and they're going to have  to all drop their prices drastically. 
[02:56:30]  You're not getting...  Maybe a couple out there will get $2,000, but most of them are not...  They're going to barely get what they paid for.  Yep.  Maybe twice they paid for it.  Maybe.  That's it, because the next shipment will come in lickety-split, no matter what they tell  you.  Yep.  And they'll be all over.  You'll be stuck with the PlayStation 3.  Yep.  If you don't want it, and thought you were going to sell it for huge amounts of money,  you're just going to be fucked.  Everyone's got a get-rich-quick scheme.  Yeah.  Oh, stop.  All right.  Well, I'm a female gamer.  All right.  We'll talk to the...  Taking another break? 
[02:57:00]  In the middle of a break?  Yeah.  Hi.  I love listening to Opie and Anthony when I'm having a tubby.  I get clean, I laugh at the funny jokes, and I play with my submarines.  Sometimes Uncle Henry gets in the tub with me.  He makes me play with his submarine.  I'm going to be an Anthony.  I'm going to be a happy play.  All right. 
[02:57:30]  There's something going on between me and Than.  Oh, boy.  I didn't see it.  It was exciting and new.  Get on, Mike.  I was drilling him during the break.  Do you want to kiss me?  We were doing that asparagus experiment.  Yeah.  And when I got excited that my pee was smelling, I pretty much was excited. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  And I got a reaction from Than, and his reaction was to turn completely around.  And now there's a huge mirror in front of me as I'm taking a leak.  Yeah.  So he had to have seen my penis, and I just want him to admit that he saw my penis and  we can move on because there's an awkward thing happening here now.  So I'm convinced he saw it, but he doesn't want to say he saw it.  Well, his mic was on, so why don't we just play a clip of what was said.  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[02:58:30]  Aw.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Yeah.  I'm a fucking idiot.  You shouldn't have turned around.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  This is a giant cock.  Oh, boy.  The voice got a little high.  Did you see my penis?  No.  Fucking liar.  You're lying.  I did not.  Fucking liar.  And I just want to explain.  Like, I was just trying to trim up down there, and like, the right side got a little short, 
[02:59:00]  so I had to do the left side.  You don't need to make excuses.  I didn't see anything.  Now I'm left with just a little, like, I don't even know what you're calling it, but  my dick.  It's usually not like that.  It was just a shaving accident.  So please.  You did see it.  Shaving.  Did you see it?  I don't know what the norm is, and I don't know what it's like today.  Dude, it's not gay if you saw it.  You turned around because you thought you were going to smell the asparagus thing,  so I understand.  You got a little excited with the experiment.  It doesn't mean you're gay, but I think you saw my penis.  Excuse me while I whip this out. 
[02:59:30]  You corrected me fast enough that I was...  And it looks like it has measles around the area because I don't know.  Well, I might have used an older razor or something.  Oh, my God.  Measles.  Your cock's a mess.  It really is.  So I just want to explain some of the things away here.  Let's just get it out in the open.  Did you see his measly cock?  I did not see.  Are you sure you didn't see it?  Yeah, measly or otherwise.  How big is he?  I don't know.  I would have looked.  Yeah, that's why I didn't choose you, by the way. 
[03:00:00]  Well, I wouldn't have fucking felt desire for it, but I would have looked.  Who gives a shit?  I'm not stupid.  I knew if I choose you, you were looking.  Yeah, why not?  Ant would have looked.  Nah, I wouldn't have looked.  You're not curious about your co-host, Cock?  What's wrong with you?  Not really.  In the list of things I'm curious about.  Things don't get you sometimes.  I don't even think I could come up with a number.  No.  Yeah.  What?  No.  I make a special effort at urinals and whatnot, too, just to look straight ahead at a tile. 
[03:00:30]  Sometimes it's even got to be less than a tile.  It's got to be a dot on a tile.  So you're completely focused.  You don't get the stage fright.  And you don't get accused of glancing over and saying, hey, nice cock.  People are accusing you of being a size queen there, I think.  Size queen.  Size queen.  And then you got Mr. Torrance from Whackbag.  Fact one, Dan sees Opie's wee-wee.  Fact two, Opie says there's something going on between me and Thann. 
[03:01:00]  Fact three, Opie says I just pounded Thann.  Fact four, Opie wants Thann to talk about his junk.  Thann is a size queen.  And then Bill from Waterford, Opie's cock has acne.  It's an old razor.  And now it's all, like, measly.  Ew.  Here you go.  It's measly on the side.  Yeah, I know Bob's mood is on hold.  He can wait.  Old razor.  What, like a Bic, like an old Bic razor you used? 
[03:01:30]  Well, yeah.  No, well, it's something nicer than that.  But it's all about the...  A little rusty.  The shaving cream you use, I guess, right?  Jimmy, how do you do yours?  He makes his own shaving cream.  How do you do yours so you don't have measles around the whole thing?  In the shower, I always shave the same way.  But I get...  Look at this.  I'm not going to shave my dick.  But look at this.  All right.  I'll show you a little something if you show me.  Oh.  Look at that.  No, no.  It's not...  I'm not showing...  This is really getting fucking homo.  All right.  Look, here's the problem.  Nothing gay about that at all.  All right.  Wait a minute. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  When you're showing a man, if you're only showing what you shave, it's like, look.  All right.  Look.  See?  See?  I got...  Why is he pulling you off, man?  Yeah.  See?  Look.  See?  Look.  Look at mine now.  Look.  Ew.  Yeah.  It's all measly.  It's awful.  You don't have a pubis.  You have a 14-year-old frightened girl who eats badly.  See what happened?  I'll even show you my hairstyle, all right?  It's not gay.  Because what happened was I was just trying to shave up the sides a little.  Keep it nice, right? 
[03:02:30]  And I'm left with this because I'm fucked up.  The pad data, by the way, says E-Rock's dream.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  I'm fucked up and I'm left with this.  Ew.  What is that?  All right.  All right.  I've had it.  I'm tapping out.  What the fuck did you do to yourself?  What is wrong with you?  It's like shaving like...  What, you shave with a bick?  You shave one of those little...  Get a fucking Mach 3.  Those are the greatest, dude.  Why is there a point pointing up?  It's awful.  It's awful. 
[03:03:00]  But it's up to, like, your belly button.  No, it's not, dude.  Because I shave...  I want to look again.  Look, belly button's way up here.  Just look.  See, look.  See, look, Ant.  Here's the thing.  Look, see?  No, you've already showed the side of your bag.  No, but right there.  You see how, like, it's all smooth?  Feel that.  You someone want to feel that?  Feel that?  No, um...  Dude, it's like what happened yesterday.  Let me explain some.  It's kind of like when you do your sideburns and this side gets a little shorter, so you got  to match them up.  And I did that a couple times, and now it's just a mess down there. 
[03:03:30]  It's got measles, and it's got some hairstyle I couldn't even describe to anybody.  I know.  All I saw was a pointy thing.  It's not that pointy.  It's shaved like a pointy hat.  Like your dick is a fucking court jester.  Dude, why do you leave any hair on it?  Get rid of all of it.  Smooth shave it in the shower.  Every other day I do it in the shower.  And these fucking girls love sucking your dick like that, because there's nothing on  it, man.  It's fucking cleaner for them.  Yeah, the 200 bucks don't hurt either. 
[03:04:00]  I'm not saying it does.  We've got to take a survey.  We've got to ask the girls, because I'm not sure about that.  They love it.  Some might not like it.  I'm not brave enough to just wipe it all out.  Well, the girls I fuck, I mean, let's be honest, they don't have any either.  I mean, they will eventually someday, but I mean...  Yeah, sure.  All right.  You know, I'm willing every once in a while, when it gets a little too crazy, you take the  clippers and get rid of, you know, you trim up the hedges.  You don't fucking lay cement down in your front yard like some fucking Dago in Brooklyn. 
[03:04:30]  Listen to me.  You got to keep your lawn nice, but you don't let it get overgrown and all bushy, but you  don't rototill the whole thing up and coat it with cement.  All right, who wants to feel...  No one.  No, no, not my dick, but the top.  Who wants to feel the pubis?  Again, no one.  Just with the back of your hand.  Who wants to...  With the back of your knuckles.  Why?  It's all right.  Why would anyone in this room...  Because it's so smooth.  Who has fucked up recently on this show?  Who didn't get my fucking headphones? 
[03:05:00]  Who's responsible for getting my headphones?  Excellent point.  I want to know.  Who?  Not me.  Not Than.  Than will not rat this person out.  Not Than.  Who is it?  Who is it, Than?  We have to find out.  Someone has to set up who gets the headphones and whose job is to make sure my headphones  are plugged in and here.  Who is it?  Craig.  Craig, you got to...  Is it you?  You got to feel Jimmy's...  How do you keep fucking this up?  I understand that, like, it's not every day.  I'm not saying it's every day.  All right, you got to feel Jimmy's...  What?  It's not him? 
[03:05:30]  Well, who the fuck is it?  He was online today.  I was online for the PS3.  Oh, go fuck yourself then.  Who doesn't plug in my headphones?  They got to touch Jimmy's pubis.  That's right.  With their cheek.  Why am I not being told?  Why is that?  The boss wants to know.  Then I'm going to have to exert a little authority over you, which I don't like doing.  Yes.  But being your superior, you being my subordinate, I must now insist...  I must now insist that you tell me who is supposed to plug in my headphones. 
[03:06:00]  Got to tell.  It's not a snitch.  It's not ratting.  I'm ordering you.  Or else you'll be touching Jimmy's pubis.  And you have to chew the rest of the fucking olive off these pits I'm spitting in.  Mm-hmm.  Well, you got to chew the pit a little.  Just a little.  I gave you a pass the first time.  You weren't being a rat or anything.  And I said, all right, you don't want to say.  That's fine.  But I came in and we went right to a phone call, albeit the suckiest fucking phone call  we've ever gotten.  And I couldn't hear it because my headphones weren't in. 
[03:06:30]  Again, someone forgot.  So I just...  Who did it?  Who isn't?  You got to say it.  You, isn't it?  It was Bodzini, wasn't it?  It's you, isn't it?  Is it you?  No.  Okay.  Who is it?  By the way...  Give me a clue.  Does he roam the night sucking blood?  No.  And who's hearing this and not owning up to it?  Yes.  Somebody's actually hearing it now and not even fucking festive.  Wait a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Before we get...  Can everybody get...  Are they in here right now? 
[03:07:00]  I think the problem is I think there might be some confusion.  All right.  So it's Master Poe.  Yes.  Anytime.  Anything's confused.  Please say it, Steve.  How am I...  I'm with you.  How am I supposed...  I don't...  My claws can't fit the little jack in the hole.  Are you saying it's Mars?  Oh, boy.  Is Mars supposed to plug in my headphones?  Hold on.  Like, it has not been firmly established.  You are like fucking Ronald Reagan... 
[03:07:30]  Oh, he's awful.  ...on the stand.  We're gonna get to the bottom of this.  Mars, are you supposed to plug in my headphones on a daily basis?  Like, uh, Than said, who's stuff, uh, established, I have my own headphones to, uh, test in the studio.  So I never touch all you guys' headphones.  All right.  So mine are in this cabinet, I gather.  So where do they...  I guess.  How do they get from the cabinet to, uh, plugged in?  On a daily basis, they do.  But occasionally, they're not here.  So somebody has to have the job of doing that that they're not taking very seriously. 
[03:08:00]  Who put mine out today?  Yeah, who put yours out today?  Yours are always out there.  Why?  I don't want people using mine.  My fucking name is on for a reason.  I don't want people using my thing.  All right, listen.  What about...  Jimmy, unfortunately, no one's gonna be touching your cock today, because no one's gonna be...  I can't believe no one's fucking fessing.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I was trying to help you.  I am stunned.  I'm gonna have to start being a fucking cock, just like Opie, to you people.  I'll tell you what.  All bets are off now.  I'm not the nice guy anymore.  Ooh.  Everyone, go fuck yourself. 
[03:08:30]  Ooh.  That's right.  Anthony, I'll tell you what.  Ooh.  Am I kidding?  I'll take it upon myself.  I'll do it.  No, it's not now who's gonna do it.  Yeah.  It's who fucked up.  Well, we got to have a sacrificial lamb.  Some head's gotta roll here.  I say Sam.  And it's Jimmy's head between an intern's fingers.  By the way, as we try to figure that out, Aaron from Michigan, nice flock of seagulls haircut  on your beanbag there, buddy.  Flock of seagulls.  Oh, no.  And can we put a rest to this argument? 
[03:09:00]  John from Salem, North Carolina.  It depends what part of the country you're in, you dope.  Opie, you fucking idiot.  The people are waiting in line, not online.  You ignorant Yankee preteen fucking homo.  Ooh.  Jimmy, no homo.  I love you.  All right.  Thank you.  Some people say in line.  Some people say online.  Right.  It depends where you live.  If I'm online, I'm on the computer.  There's an imaginary line that you're on. 
[03:09:30]  It's called on line.  You're in line.  Other people say you're in line.  I get it.  You could be online and standing in line.  And you could be in a line.  You could be on a line.  Right.  But it really depends where you live.  You could be the cunt that's supposed to plug in my headphones and don't.  Right.  Some people say soda.  Some people.  You could be on the unemployment line.  Some people say pop.  Right.  I say soda.  Some people say pizza.  Some people say pie.  Some people say both.  Soda pop.  All right. 
[03:10:00]  Is it him?  It's him, right?  You got to.  It's him.  I hope it's the.  Let's say hi to Bob.  We have to.  Thank you, Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  Hey there, Bob.  Bob.  Who's there?  Who's there?  Hi.  It's Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Sorry for the wait, man.  Hi, you guys.  How are you?  We got to talk about our pubic hair for a while, Bob.  I hope you understand.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Hey, I want to hear about where do you get these hookers for 200 bucks?  Oh, I forgot.  Fucking Zamuda.  You can get them probably off Craig's, but I think you're better off flying to certain  locations. 
[03:10:30]  I think we talked about Brazil once.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Or the Moonlight Bunny Ranch.  I've never.  You've never been there?  No.  Dennis.  Why aren't you guys coming out for the show?  I thought you were going to be here.  I'm in Vegas now.  I was going to set you up backstage, and you were going to be able to talk to everybody.  What is it?  The network didn't want to spend the money, or what?  No one tells that shit.  No one tells them.  I'll be out there tomorrow.  I'm flying out tomorrow.  Are you serious?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm doing a show at Saget, but Opie and Anthony, we should have had them out there to broadcast.  Yeah, we would have loved it, but it's just, I don't know. 
[03:11:00]  It's not going to happen again.  Logistically, it didn't work out.  Yeah, yeah.  Cool, yeah.  We're here doing it, you know.  It's going to be Saturday, and Rob and Whoop and Billy are hosting again, and we got Roseanne  Barr, Louis Black, Dale Ugly, Susie Essman, Jimmy Kimmel, George Lopez, Bill Maher, Howie  Mandel, Ray Romano, Rita Redner, Dane Cook, Sarah Silverman, isn't she gorgeous?  John Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Rosie O'Donnell, so they're all here.  Wow.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  It's pretty cool.  Sarah Silverman, most fuckable female comic? 
[03:11:30]  Isn't she great, man?  What'd you think?  Is Jimmy the luckiest man?  Yeah, he is lucky to be back.  Kimmel's nailing it, right?  I thought he meant me for a second.  Jimmy Norton?  No, I'm wrong.  Like, wow.  Norton, man, how are you?  I'm really good, man.  I'm going to see you backstage, because I got credentials.  I have a guy with me, though, who doesn't have credentials.  Club Soda Kenny.  He does, like, security for us on the road.  Should we get some credentials to come backstage?  We'll take care of him.  We'll take care of him.  You're asking for credentials during an interview?  For Club Soda Kenny.  I am, because I have to.  Yeah, no, it's hard to get back there.  They won't let me. 
[03:12:00]  No.  No.  Cool, guys.  Hey, Bob, it's Opie speaking.  I've got to tell you, Andy Kaufman, one of my biggest influences.  Oh, good.  That's good to hear.  Growing up, just an amazing, amazing performer.  He was the best, man.  What an original, huh?  Absolutely.  That was the real deal.  What did you think of Jim Carrey's performance?  I liked it.  What did you think of the movie?  It was okay.  Yeah, yeah, I agree.  I guess it's hard to kind of do it all in a movie, is what I'm getting at, because I was  hoping they were going to go into some other things, but you only have, what, two hours? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, that's right.  That would take eight hours.  Jim Carrey's performance, though, is unbelievable.  Yeah, he's great.  Well, you know, him and Kaufman have the same birthday.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  And Jim, you know, at the end of the film, when Tony Clifton appears one year after Andy's  death, in real life, Jim Carrey was actually a struggling comedian at the comedy store when  that actually took place at the comedy store.  Many people, you know, look, what, he's like the $30, $40 million man now, you know, per picture.  Right.  And people don't realize in comedy, he spent, guys, and you know this, he spent eight years 
[03:13:00]  working for Mitzi Short at the comedy store, two shows a night for free.  So that guy put in his dues.  He certainly did.  Yeah, but he was a huge Andy Kaufman fan, and he was determined to get the role.  One of my highlights, I was performing at the, at the, it was the House of Blues when  you had the 20th anniversary of his death, it was that show.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  Were you there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was on the show.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, no, yeah.  It was me.  It was me.  I was on the show. 
[03:13:30]  Bob, that was very hurtful.  You were funny.  Thanks, man.  One of the highlights for me was getting my photo with Tony Clifton.  I was so fucking happy to meet Tony Clifton.  Oh, you got the Tony Clifton.  How could you not?  He was supposed to be on the comic relief show here, and guess what?  What?  He scared a few of the top performers on the show, so they bumped him.  Really?  Yeah, Tony is off the show.  Who wouldn't want Tony Clifton on the show?  Well, they're scared.  They thought he was going to take a, drop his pants and shit or something.  I don't know.  That blows.  Hey, I figured out Andy's death, by the way. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, go on.  I got it all figured out.  Okay.  Like, a lot of people think that he faked his own death, right?  Yeah.  To have the ultimate prank on everybody.  Yeah.  Because no one has really done that.  I think he knew he had the cancer.  He knew he was going to die, and that's when he started telling people behind the scenes  that, what if I went away and then came back someday?  Well, there's all these theories.  So many people think he's still alive.  It took me a long time because he had, like you said, what was so bizarre, he was planning 
[03:14:30]  to fake his death.  And this was about six months before he announced that he had cancer.  And then a few months after that, he died.  It is one of the most bizarre things.  Well, the point I'm making, though, is he knew before he started talking about how he was  going to fake his own death and didn't tell you that maybe he went to a doctor and, oh,  boy, this doesn't look good.  And then he thought about it for a while and said, you know what?  I know what I'm going to do.  You know, I never heard that theory.  That could be, you know, with Andy, anything's positive. 
[03:15:00]  He called me up and he said, you know, when he was planning on faking his death, and I  said, Andy, this is one prank I can't be a part of.  And he said, why not?  I said, first of all, it's illegal.  I said, people fake their death every day.  Insurance scams.  They don't want to play.  I'm only your member of AFTRA and SAG.  You know, you fake your death.  You know, there's going to be insurance.  You know, this is illegal.  Yeah, because it's not a rumor anymore.  I mean, there's some legitimate people have come forth and said he did say that he was  going to fake his own death.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:15:30]  There are executives over at Universal, because we were working on the Tony Clifton story at  Universal at the time, and Tom Mount and Sean Daniels, two executives from Universal, they  will tell that if you walked up to them now, they would say, Andy Kaufman is alive.  He sat in my office.  He told me he was going to do this.  And, you know, Andy was a health nut.  Andy never drank.  Andy never smoked.  He was a vegetarian, did three hours of yoga a day.  He wouldn't be in a room if anyone was smoking.  The fact that he came down with lung cancer, they don't believe it. 
[03:16:00]  John Moffitt, who is the co-executive of Comic Relief with me, he had the show Friday.  When Andy had this idea, he went to see Moffitt.  Moffitt, too.  If you ask John Moffitt, he will say, Andy Kaufman is alive.  He sat with me down in my house.  He made me swear on a Bible not to tell anyone that I am going to fake my death, and I will  return after 20 years.  Yeah.  So these people have no reason to make any of this stuff up, and they believe it.  You know?  Do you believe it there, Bob? 
[03:16:30]  Listen, I, you know, with Andy, I had said I can't be a part of this.  I'm not going to lie to your parents whose heart's going to be broken because you're pulling  off a prank.  I believe he's dead, but if he walked on stage Saturday night at Comic Relief, I would  not be shocked.  Oh, is that a tease?  You got a little tease going there, Bob?  Well.  Hey, if that was going to happen, I'd work it out with Andy.  It wouldn't be at Comic Relief. 
[03:17:00]  It would be at, like, Shea Stadium or something.  It would be at the Super Bowl or something, right?  And we'd build it up with you guys for, like, a year, you know?  Yeah, but I've been thinking about this for a while.  I've read a lot of the books.  What was the name of yours?  I've read yours, I believe.  Andy Kaufman Revealed.  Yeah, I read that one.  That was excellent.  Then it was Bill Zamey's.  I read his.  Yeah.  You have a great controversy about it.  Every time there's a book out on Andy Kaufman, I pick it up and read it.  But I thought about it.  I'm like, you know what?  You've got to get into his mindset.  I'm like, he knew he had the cancer before anyone else. 
[03:17:30]  I've never heard that.  He knew something was wrong.  He went, man, this sucks.  I'm going to die.  But, you know, it goes with what he did when he was alive.  And this would be a cool way to leave this earth.  I'll start a rumor that I'm going to fake my own death, even though I'm going to really die.  And then people will be talking about it 20-some-odd years later.  Well, you know, towards the end, when he supposedly was dying, according to you.  No, you thought he is dying.  He does it there.  I used to push him around in the wheelchair.  He was down to about 75 pounds.  Jesus.  Chemotherapy and everything. 
[03:18:00]  And people in Hollywood who thought he was faking his death would come up to him and go, Andy, you with this dying bullshit.  This is great, you know.  And he'd laugh.  Compton would laugh his ass off.  It was the most, I mean, it's so bizarre.  But it's so great, at least for me as his best friend.  You know, it's great to entertain the thought that maybe he is still alive.  Or he did what you said, you know, that he had the wits about him.  Because, you know, so many people, when it gets down to that and cancer and horrible disease, they lose it all, you know.  They lose what they were all about. 
[03:18:30]  And Andy was such a true artist, man.  He stayed the course.  Right.  You know, if anybody would do that, it would be him.  And I remember when Elvis died, you know, and all those rumors started.  That's kind of when this, because he was, you know, he used to do Elvis in his act and everything.  And that's when it really kicked in for him.  He said, man, you know, everybody's saying that Elvis faked his death.  And he said, you know, he didn't.  He said, but could you imagine if a performer did that and came back 20 years later?  And I say, why 20 years? 
[03:19:00]  And he said, look, one year would be bullshit, five.  He says, if you were a real artist about it, you'd have to hang out someplace for 20 years.  That's a commitment, man.  No, that's Andy.  Oh, fuck.  I would stand on street corners.  And, you know, he pulled off more pranks on the streets than he did ever on Saturday Night Live or Letterman or anything.  Wouldn't you guys do shit in restaurants and stuff over a girlfriend or over a date?  Oh, yeah.  I would always go into a restaurant, you know, and it was all preplanned.  And he'd be in there.  And, you know, I'd play kind of a timid guy, like on a date with a girl, you know, a girlfriend that I'd been, like, dating for a while. 
[03:19:30]  And he'd come over and he'd say, you know, I'm Andy Kaufman to the girl.  And what's your name?  I'd go, Bob Smuda.  And he'd go, well, you know, I'm a big star on Taxi.  And I just wanted to know if, you know, if you'd like to go out sometime.  I'd say, excuse me, you know, I'm on a date here with this girl.  And people would hear this in the restaurant.  Then he'd wait.  I'd go to the bathroom and he'd come over to the girl.  Everybody in the restaurant would overhear this.  And he said, look, that guy's a loser.  I'm a star.  I'm on Taxi. 
[03:20:00]  I'm making 45 G's a week.  And I like you.  When I want something in life, I take it.  Here's what I'm going to ask.  You dropped this bozo right now.  And I'm telling you, you will be my girlfriend for the next six months.  You will meet Danny DeVito.  You will meet Judd Hirsch.  You will fly to me with me to Switzerland and all this stuff, you know.  And the people would be listening to this.  He says, you've got to tell this schmuck when he comes out of the bathroom, that's it.  You're leaving with me. 
[03:20:30]  And I'd come out.  And, of course, it was all set up.  And the girl who was also a plant would say, you know, Bob, I really like Andy.  I'm going to leave with him.  And people would be very upset.  You know, I'd be crying.  I'd be broken.  You know, and, yeah, he was just great.  And it was just, it was all day.  He never stopped.  It was so, you know, and he was accused of just performing.  Look at the influence of just performing.  And people would say George Shapiro, the management, would say, Andy,  you're just performing for yourself. 
[03:21:00]  You're not trying to entertain people.  You're not trying to be loved by the audience.  And so many people, I remember Sam Tennyson hired me towards the end of his life as his producer and said,  Bob, I'm hiring you because you know, if it wasn't for Andy Kaufman, I never would have gotten this business.  He said, if he proved to me that you didn't have to be liked by the fucking audience,  you could be hated by the audience.  Andy liked it better.  We're doing the wrestling and everything.  And with Tony Clifton.  And so it opened up a whole new area, genre in the world of comedy. 
[03:21:30]  Like, fuck you.  Fuck the audience.  Who gives a fuck?  Look what you guys are doing.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  He was great with fucking with the audience, man.  Oh, yeah.  I love that about him.  The Carnegie Hall show.  Yes.  Do they really believe the whole, what was it, his grandma he brought on stage?  Let me give it, don't give the punch away.  No, I won't, I won't.  Yeah.  So what happened with that, you know, Andy played Carnegie Hall, and this is a dream for  the performer, you know, and he said when he was a little boy, he used to say to his 
[03:22:00]  grandma, mom, grandma, someday, his grandma Pearl, his grandma Pearl, someday I'm going  to be famous, and when I am, I'm going to play Carnegie Hall, and I'm going to give you  the best seat in the house.  And so he plays Carnegie Hall, and he tells his story, opens the show by telling the story.  He said, now, so I flew out, my grandma always thought I was a nut.  And I wouldn't, I wouldn't amount to anything.  I flew her out for the show, and he brings her on stage.  She was like 87 years old or something.  To a standing ovation, by the way.  Standing ovation.  People just going nuts, like, oh my God. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  She couldn't believe it, and he brought her out, and she was very old, and he said, I  told you I would give you the best seat in the house when I was a little boy.  She said, well, that's true, Andy.  He said, ladies, I not only flew out my grandma from Hollywood, Florida, but I also flew out  her sofa, and we brought her sofa out on stage, a real sofa, sat her on stage.  We had a little table there for tea.  We had somebody, like, every, you know, the show was long.  Maybe about every half hour, somebody came out.  The old woman had to go to the bathroom or something, and she sat there. 
[03:23:00]  Okay, cut to the end of the show.  And Andy, at the end, this is the famous, you know, milk and cookies.  So at the end of the show, Andy says, you've been a great audience, a great show.  And he says, I'd like to thank my guest.  I'd like to thank the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  And we had the doors, excuse me, if Carnegie Hall opened up the back doors, all 350 members  of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  These weren't plants.  These weren't local people.  We flew them out.  Andy wanted it.  They came in. 
[03:23:30]  They're singing down the aisles.  He says, I'd also like to thank the New York City Rockettes from both wings of Carnegie  Hall, 40 members of the Rockettes.  These girls are coming out, kicking their legs, the choir's singing.  He says, it was Christmas time.  I'd also like to thank Santa Claus.  We had it rigged.  Then a sled came down from the rafters of Carnegie Hall.  It started snowing, not just on stage, in the theater.  Everybody's going crazy.  And he said, now, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank my grandma and this little  little lady that you watch for two, three hours on stage. 
[03:24:00]  Just sit there.  Gets up.  I never saw a more thrilling moment in my life.  Gets up slowly out of the chair.  Walks to the footlights with all this hubbub going on around her.  Reaches over.  Pulls the face mask off.  It's Robin Williams.  And he does this most tremendous bow.  The audience leaps to his feet.  Pandemonium breaks out.  Andy tells everyone to settle down.  He said, that was act one.  For act two, ladies and gentlemen, we're going outside. 
[03:24:30]  I have buses that are going to take you for milk and cookies.  Well, everybody thought he was full of shit.  Went outside.  We had 35 buses.  It took me a year and a half to get permits to get 35 buses in front of Carnegie Hall on  a Saturday night.  The whole audience went up there.  Moved the whole audience to the New York School of Printing where we had every small little  kindergarten table and chair we could find.  Had the audience sit there.  Gave them milk and cookies.  Then we had strippers, sword swallers. 
[03:25:00]  This went on to four in the morning.  And Andy says to me then, at that point, he says, and now George Shapiro is coming up  to me going, he says, this overtime on the buses is going to cost tens of thousands of  dollars.  Andy's going to be broke.  We've got to pull the plug on this.  So I tell Andy, and he said, well, what should we do?  What should we do?  You know, I said, and just off the top of my head, I said, tell the audience to go home  and get some sleep, that the show is going to continue tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. at 
[03:25:30]  the Staten Island Ferry.  So he tells them everybody to leave.  Now, next morning, 7.30, both him and I got lucky with a couple of girls from the radio  and the music hall.  So I'm sitting in my room, getting a fucking head and coughing.  And, you know, at about a quarter to eight, the phone starts ringing in my room the next  morning.  And I know it's Andy because we said this thing about Carnegie, you know, me to sit, you  know, over at Staten Island Ferry to the audience.  And I'm not answering because I don't want to leave and I'm all burnt out from staying 
[03:26:00]  up for weeks working at the fucking show.  Finally, he's a knock on the door.  He's not stopping.  I said, yeah, Andy, what is it?  You know, he says, do you think we should maybe go down to the Staten Island Ferry?  Do you think anybody showed up?  And I said, Andy, I'm sure they think it was a joke.  I said, let me go back here.  I got this hot girl here, you know.  And he says, OK, well, as soon as I close the door, I hit Smeichel, what if there's one  press person there?  So I said, come here, come on, let's go.  We all jump in the cab with the two Radio City Music Hall girls in these outfits still because 
[03:26:30]  we wanted them to keep their outfits on, you know.  No, because you brought them back to your room.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  That was part of the deal.  So we go down to Staten Island Ferry.  Guys, I'm sitting there.  We get down there.  Yeah.  There are over 350 people from the night before.  It was one of the most incredible moments.  And I mean, I mean, it brought tears to Andy's eyes.  He got he bought each of them a roundtrip ticket on the Staten Island Ferry, an ice cream  comb, and he wrestled any woman who wanted to wrestle with him that morning. 
[03:27:00]  So that's how you end the show.  Woman wrestling thing.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Like, you see so many comedians today because there was a real cringe factor, a real uncomfortability.  And I mean, with him and with what you guys did, it was like a very real thing, man.  There was no bullshit about it.  It was commitment.  It was utter commitment to the bit or the character at the moment.  And so many guys now you see doing like these really shallow attempts.  Like they want that reputation or they want that adoration or the respect of the other  comedians for doing it. 
[03:27:30]  But they're not really it's not a really organic thing.  Yeah.  The beauty is you didn't care about the repercussions.  No.  You know what I mean?  Some of these guys want to get edgy and crazy, but they're like, yeah, but what's going to  you know, you got to just commit and not worry about what the repercussions are going  to be in the end.  That was it.  And that's what a lot of these newer guys that are trying to career.  Huh?  He didn't care.  Yeah, absolutely.  He was kicked off a Saturday Night Live.  Nobody would touch him towards the end of just like the movie said. 
[03:28:00]  Right.  And he didn't care.  He said, fine, get me out of this bullshit.  I don't want to be a celebrity anymore.  Speaking of newer guys, what do you think of Borat Sasha?  Well, you know, I haven't seen the movie yet, you know, but I've been doing a lot of  interviews, you know, for the comic leave thing.  And people say, well, aren't you upset that it's a Andy Kaufman ripoff?  And to me, no, not at all.  I think, you know, if Andy's influence is far and wide, and I think that's great.  You know, I haven't seen, have you seen the movie?  Yeah.  I've seen his character enough.  I think he's a different type of character.  I mean, I don't know much about it.  There's some similarities there. 
[03:28:30]  The movie was really good.  A lot of laughs in there.  Well, it's the idea of the commitment.  I guess he gets in this character and stays in and goes does shows.  He got beat up here in New York because he stayed in character.  What do you mean he got beat up?  Someone punched him, beat him up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone, he got in a huge fight downtown, I guess.  He was in character and he was, he was doing something that was sort of gay and the guy  didn't appreciate it.  He was in character and there was a huge fight and Sasha got punched a few times.  Well, I think that's great.  You know, you got to suffer for your art.  Well, Bob, it's really, it's really great that you're still going, man. 
[03:29:00]  Comic Relief is still going.  It's really amazing.  Well, can I, can I do one more thing before we get the big plug in?  Bob, you mentioned it casually about the, the, the wrestling.  Yeah.  I got to tell you, that's the only thing that just creeps me out about Andy Kaufman, how  he would just wrestle chicks on the road.  Oh, you didn't like it?  A little creepy.  A little creepy.  I understand if he's getting women on the road and stuff, but he got women so he could  wrestle them in his hotel room.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Cause you know what?  You know, if you ever saw him wrestle on Saturday night, you know, I was the referee  and I was always there and it would be amazing.  I'm sad. 
[03:29:30]  He did this.  But he got off on just wrestling girls, right?  Oh, he did this just to pick up chicks.  Right.  And he just thought this was the most self-indulgent thing to do.  And that's what he did on.  And, and he used to get a huge fucking hard on when he would wrestle them in front of  people.  It was like a, you know, so, so before he means hard on, like he got a hard on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not like, oh yeah, this was, oh yeah.  No, he'd come.  Most of the time he'd shoot his wad in his pants while he was wrestling.  What a good boy.  I was so scared on Saturday Night Live that when he finally convinced Lorne Michaels to 
[03:30:00]  get him to do this, because I know the whole thing was just about his sexual, come on with  this shit.  You know, he didn't care.  He thought he said, he would actually say, he said, I can't believe Lorne Michaels is  going to let me wrestle women on TV.  He says, Bob, this has no entertainment value whatsoever.  This is totally self-indulgent on my part.  And I, I love it.  So he would get the girl.  So that is why he's in those long, when you see him wrestle, he's in these long johns  and backstage at Saturday Night Live, he would put on a jockstrap.  I would take a whole roll of duct tape, gaffer's tape and wrap it around him. 
[03:30:30]  Then he'd put on a bathing suit over that.  And then he put on long, no, then he put on the long johns and then the bathing suit,  because I was afraid he was going to pitch a tent on live Saturday Night Live.  Wow, that's great.  And people would understand what was going on.  That would have been a moment.  I got it.  He fucked 80% of the women that he wrestled, 80%.  And we did this in concert on tours across the country when we played colleges.  And 80% of these women, and that's what it was all about. 
[03:31:00]  Amazing.  That's it.  He was a wall follower.  He would never be able to, you know, he didn't drink.  He wouldn't go into a bar.  He could never pick up a girl.  But on stage, the way we designed it, to have the women come on stage, and then I'd put my hand over their heads, because the audience would pick who was going to wrestle him.  And, of course, the guy's going to pick the hottest looking babe up there.  So they selected.  So every time, I'm telling you, we did this, you know, sometimes we'd have mad boyfriends wanting to kick his ass and everything else. 
[03:31:30]  But while he would be wrestling them on Saturday Night Live, if you watch his mouth move, everybody's screaming when he's wrestling.  I'm down there.  And this is what I would hear, because I would be the ref on the mat.  He's, you know, the girls, he's trying to pin the girl.  The girl's trying to pin him.  And this is what I would hear him say.  Nobody could hear this.  He'd say to the girl, he said, can you believe it?  You're on Saturday Night Live right now.  Millions of people are watching us.  He said, I want to make love to you so fucking bad.  He said, you come backstage afterwards.  You talk to Zemuda here. 
[03:32:00]  He said, this is it, man.  He said, this is so hot.  This is what I would be hearing.  Wow.  So he's one of the fuck these girls.  The wrestling was a good ruse.  Yeah, that's all it was.  It's just a way to pick up chicks.  What a strange way to pick up chicks.  Yeah.  It worked.  Wow.  Great guy, though.  We're very happy you called him.  What a wonderful artist, huh?  Yeah, absolutely.  No, honestly, absolutely.  Recently, I just started watching Andy Kaufman clips on YouTube.  I haven't watched in a while, and I'm finding some cool things up there.  Oh, man.  Isn't that odd?  He died of lung cancer, and his name was Kaufman. 
[03:32:30]  Yep.  I just find that odd.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I wrote a script for Universal Studios called The Tony Clifton Story, and that script was  handed in four years.  Oh, God, this is amazing.  Four years before his death, and on page 112 of The Tony Clifton Story.  You can get this online, and people who have this script.  In that, he has Tony Clifton die of lung cancer at Cedars-Sinai Hospital.  Four years later, he would die of lung cancer at Cedars-Sinai. 
[03:33:00]  How come he killed him so quick?  Did he, like, he had no idea he had it, and by the time he found out, it was like...  Well, this, this, this, this was the kind, the one that, the cancer that he had was very  fast.  It's the one that gets in the lungs, and boom, you know?  And it's, like, one out of every hundred thousand people get this, get this lung cancer.  If only you could have given him a good luck bro opiate.  Well, Peter Jennings, I think, had the same form of lung cancer, if I'm not mistaken.  Yeah, it's fast with those guys.  Speaking of Tony Clifton, I could talk to Bob all day.  The Tony Clifton character was so brilliant, because it was a character that Andy Kaufman 
[03:33:30]  started with, and then handed it off to Bob, and then people are booking Andy Kaufman, thinking  they're getting Andy Kaufman doing Tony Clifton, and Andy Kaufman is sitting home laughing,  and just another prank he pulls on everybody, and there's Bob Zemuda on these huge TV  shows, because they assumed it's Andy under the makeup.  Oh, I did Letterman, who likes, David Letterman, who likes to think he's such a control freak,  and he's got everything figured fucking out, right?  Yeah.  Clifton did Letterman three times, and in fact, it was me, and it is... 
[03:34:00]  I'm talking about a...  A mattress.  You can't...  Yeah, we have a mattress sponsor.  Hold on a minute.  Jesus.  Who hit a button?  Oh, no, it's Bill.  Oh, it was Bill.  Oh, Bill is freaking out.  One of the guys in The Engineer both hit a button.  For a mattress commercial.  For a mattress commercial in the middle of you speaking.  Sorry, Bob.  But maybe they were censoring me.  Yeah, Bob, just back up like 10 seconds and continue to work on it.  So anyway, what was I saying?  What were you talking about?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what happens. 
[03:34:30]  See what the fuck happens?  This guy, fire him.  You lost the headsets, right?  Yeah.  It's even worse.  What the hell's going on?  It doesn't make enough money to fire him, unfortunately.  Well, you were talking about...  What the fuck was he?  Oh, David Letterman.  Yeah, Letterman, who's in control freak.  I'm talking about Letterman as Tony Clifton.  And Letterman is convinced it's Andy Kaufman, because we kept it...  Oh, the only people that knew this was Andy.  I wasn't even allowed to tell my mom or my wife at the time that I was on...  I'm going to be...  Honey, I'm going to be on David Letterman tonight.  What a great bit.  Sworn to secrecy. 
[03:35:00]  Couldn't tell anyone.  Working for Andy Kaufman was like working for Harry Houdini.  You know?  And I sat there, and during one of the commercial breaks, Letterman turns to me.  You know, and he says, during the commercial break, he says, Andy, if it wasn't you, I would  swear it was somebody else.  And he did not know this, you know, until years later.  You know, until years later.  He found out he'd been duped.  The best one is, and just like in the movie, this was the great one, one of the greatest  moments.  So, Andy, so, Harris Casino in Tahoe calls George Shapiro, Andy's manager, who Danny 
[03:35:30]  DeVito played in the movie, and says, you know, we want to book Tony Clifton up here  in Harris.  And George goes, well, you know, it's not Andy Kaufman, just what you were talking about.  And the guy goes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it's not Andy, thinking that, oh, yeah,  Andy denies he's Tony.  But George is going, no, no, it's really not Andy.  And the guy goes, okay, okay, I know, I get it, but we want to book him anyway, thinking  they're getting Kaufman.  So I go there for a two-week run in the main room of Harris Casino, right? 
[03:36:00]  Now, Andy would show up during the day walking around the casino to be seen, to pull off  this illusion.  People would come up to him, what are you doing?  He'd hear Andy, and he'd say, oh, I came to see Tony Clifton, right?  And they'd go, yeah, yeah, sure, Tony.  Yeah, wink, wink.  Anyway, I would go up every night and play Tony.  Now, most of the time when I was up there, Andy, at night, would be over at the Mustang  Ranch, you know, getting laid.  He was very heavy into the hookers. 
[03:36:30]  You know, but occasionally, he would show up while I was on stage, and he'd put on  a beard, you know, and a long wig, you know, and sunglasses, and he would start heckling  Clifton, saying, we know, why do you do this?  We know you're Andy Kaufman.  Why don't you take off that makeup?  And he would cause such trouble in the place.  Remember, nobody knows it's Andy Kaufman, that the security from Harris would come out  and haul him away.  Little they know, they were hauling away the guy they hired. 
[03:37:00]  Now, the best of this, and this is the best moment, so anyway, every time I'm on stage  every night, and I'm doing Clifton, I look out, and right around the same time in the show,  I look in the back of the theater, and there's one of their, because it's, you know, there  are guys, it's next to Caesars, and there was one of these brick wall, you know, sex shows,  you know, Zostick's Vegas Dance Topless Girl shows, so I'd sit there, this one girl  was a huge Andy Kaufman fan, she'd be in a rope, she'd run over from Caesars, she had 
[03:37:30]  a little break in her show, to watch Clifton, because she loved Andy, you know, and I finally  asked, is Tony Clifton, that's one of the security guys, when I said, what is that girl  coming back there, and I said, oh, well, she's a big fan of Andy Kaufman, so I figured, well,  this is too good to pass up, so what I did, the last couple nights, I got in contact,  Tony Clifton got in contact with her, right, he's fucking the shit out of her, the last  couple nights, and then she keeps saying, Andy, why can't you take off this Tony Clifton 
[03:38:00]  makeup, I'm giving her some bullshit, that, oh, the run was extended, we have no more  prosthetic pieces, I've got to keep these on, because if she sees it, Zmuda, she doesn't  go, fuck Bob Zmuda, who the fuck is he, she wants to fuck Andy Kaufman, so this goes on,  okay, six months, and I tell Andy about this, it was amazing, she was so fucking hot, six  months later, and of course, I give her, she asked for my number, so I give her Andy's  number, I have her number, I give it to Andy, six months later, Andy calls me, you know, 
[03:38:30]  we're back in LA, and Andy calls me, I said, Andy, what's wrong, he says, you know, that  girl, that girl, that girl from Vegas, I mean, from Harris, he said, she's here at LAX,  and she wants to stay over with me for a few days, what should I do, I said, Andy, you  already slept with her for fucking three nights, have her come over, you know, she goes over  to his house, and he's screwing her for the next couple days, she stays there, every couple  hours he calls me, because I now know everything, I'm briefing him, I know everything about her 
[03:39:00]  family, her brother's name, and whatnot, she thinks this is the same guy she was screwing,  screwing, you know, in Tahoe, now what makes it so bizarre, is that Andy was Jewish, you  know, oh boy, I'm a good Catholic boy, one of us was circumcised, and the other one was  not, so I don't know what the fuck she was thinking, if I strapped on some kind of prosthetic  or something, you know, on my cock, well, who's cut, are you clipped or unclipped? 
[03:39:30]  I'm unclipped, okay, so she's fucking soft foreskin, then she didn't see any, that makes  it easier, because she might have thought that you had it taken off, if she didn't see  any, and then she saw some, that's a problem, who cares about the detail, this whole thing  is crazy, yeah, that is a crazy story, but that's the kind of shit we would do, all the  time, I'm going to see you in Vegas this Friday, and I'm going to go to Comic Relief, I'm going  to give you the big plug here, this is, it's great that you're doing it again for Katrina  Victims, it's Comic Relief 2006, it's going to be this Saturday, November the 18th, it's 
[03:40:00]  9 o'clock to midnight, and it's live, it's taped late on the West Coast, I think, it's  on HBO and TBS simultaneously, and it was announced today, let's see, that, oh, it was announced  today, okay, this is an old press release we have, and it's going to be from Cedar's Palace  in Las Vegas, obviously, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, you gave the whole thing, Woody  Goldberg, and a whole shitload of very famous people, man, and thanks so much for calling  in, I'll definitely see you out there Friday.  Oh, Bob, thank you so much, thanks, Bob, I'll talk to you guys later, take care, buddy, 
[03:40:30]  okay, bye, bye, Bob Zamuda, he's a great guy, man, he's really, he's really open, he doesn't  fucking lie, like, yeah, I banged her, she was blowing me, then he got hookers, there's  no bullshit in this guy, and my fucking goal is to pull a train with him, I got to pull  a fucking train with Zamuda, I have to, wow, that would be something, as Clifton, he was  Clifton, yeah, yeah, please, as Clifton, wait, wait, you want him as Clifton, to get  a girl on a rotisserie or something, while, while she's blowing me, while he's fucking, 
[03:41:00]  I let Tony take the power position, and, uh, I just want to get blown while Tony Clifton  fucks her, that's all I want to do, and then, in the middle of it, though, the best part would  be if Bill would hit a commercial, poor Bill, do you see his face? He just, like, panics,  it's that stupid beard, and looks over, and, and, and he was shaking again, whenever that  beard comes back, all judgment goes out the window, yeah, all right, uh, should Bill touch 
[03:41:30]  your, uh, smooth skin?  No, he shouldn't, I'm sure he'd do something wrong, he'd poke it too hard, he'd poke my  pubis.  How about we do a quick break, we'll come back, we'll do line of the day, uh, the Osama  thing, real fast, and we'll get out of here.  Cool.  For to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the Fruit Roll-Up Factory,  making a Fruit Roll-Up.  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that are so much better than your American 
[03:42:00]  because I, I, you know, what, what do you, let me just, uh, well, you already know, but  you don't want to work, work good for you, right?  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad, and it stunk so bad.  You fat American, right?  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should, uh, need to know.  Okay, back to work. 
[03:42:30]  I like talking to Bob.  That was pretty cool.  Good.  Really fast, some trick.  Cop Spots Halloween Osama Dresser.  This happened in Portland, Maine.  A Democratic, uh, activist.  Oh, wow, this, okay, I didn't know this had a political angle on this.  I thought it was just some dope in a Halloween costume.  Portland, Maine.  A Democratic activist who once exposed President Bush's, uh, drunken driving arrest  was charged yesterday with terrorizing people by dressing up on Halloween as Osama bin Laden. 
[03:43:00]  Halloween or not, in this day and age, you do not get to dress as an international terrorist  and wave what appears to be an AK-47 at rush hour traffic.  Oh, okay.  See, that's the fucking crime.  Not the fact that he's dressed up like Osama.  On Halloween, you gotta think this is...  You can dress like Osama for Halloween.  Who thought there was...  Yeah, but you can have a fake gun...  Oh, you're waving at traffic.  Ah, if you're waving a fake gun at traffic and it looks like a real gun.  Hmm.  It's Halloween, though, man. 
[03:43:30]  You're gonna see all sorts of weird shit.  Yeah.  They're gonna get a trick and we're gonna get a treat.  Yeah.  Ope was gone for that.  I don't know if he knows that one.  What happened?  That's a Patrice story.  Shut up.  Ew.  Shut up.  Ew.  Oh, to bring it right back to that classroom. 
[03:44:00]  That's awful.  Shut up.  Let's...  And then nothing.  Wait, let's play that without anyone saying anything  because I'm sure there's a few listeners out there  that could do some real good stuff with that clip.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  There you go.  Use that.  I realize the more I interfered, the more I'd have to hear it.  Because it wasn't...  Ah, that's true.  It's a clip.  You could just play it all day. 
[03:44:30]  Tom Connolly's costume included a rubber mask  and plastic dynamite and grenades  in addition to the toy assault rifle.  Before he was arrested,  Connolly walked toward officers  as plastic grenades tumbled onto the ground  and officers said,  all right, this guy is just a dope.  Yeah.  Anderson said Connolly created an incredibly dangerous situation  for motorists, for police, and for himself.  He's lucky he didn't get shot.  Connolly's lawyer, blah, blah, blah,  said yesterday there was no mistaking Connolly  for a terrorist on Halloween.  Said there was no mistaking Connolly for a terrorist. 
[03:45:00]  Connolly does sound like a jerk-off.  He said Connolly was holding a sign  with a political statement  about the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, or Tabor.  Police said at least one person  who saw a sign held by Connolly  thought it was Taliban.  Oh, my God.  People are dopes, though.  Tabor is spelled T-A-B-O-R,  and there were some people out there  that thought it said Taliban.  Taliban.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's great.  There's a lot of dopes involved in this story.  Connolly, 49, made headlines  when he divulged Bush's drunken driving arrest  days before the 2000 election. 
[03:45:30]  Flute.  Derek from work.  Ope, I have your PS3 coming,  but I'm at work,  so I can't call.  How much do you give me for it?  Yo.  $2.50.  $2.50.  $2.50 for what?  Yeah.  $30.  What do you got in front of you there?  $2.50.  What do you got in front of you?  A banana.  What?  A banana.  It's a big one. 
[03:46:00]  What's a classic for this?  I don't know.  It's not a vegetable.  I'm sure of that.  A legume.  A legume.  What the hell is a legume?  Don't you just swin in a legume?  It's a legume.  Don't you just swin in a legume?  Jesus.  Give me a pit.  I want to...  I want to...  I want to chew the pedal.  I want to chew the pedal.  I want to chew the pedal.  All right.  Here, have my benenia.  Benenia.  Oh, like a monkey. 
[03:46:30]  All right.  We had a fun show today.  We got two runner-up lines of the day, Anthony.  Okay.  Let's hear the first runner-up line of the day.  No, finish it.  So, Anthony said...  It's a montage.  Montage.  Oh, my God.  Bagot.  That was...  Iraqi could not help himself when Anthony did his montage.  He had to do the backing vocal.  He had to do the backing from Team America. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  And here's the second runner-up line of the day for today.  Tom was talking about a mattress.  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, we have mattress sponsors.  I mean, he's like, you guys okay what mattress is?  And Kenny goes, uh...  He goes, you might want to need something.  And Kenny's like, no, thank you.  I have a thermopedic.  And it's...  Thermopedic.  Creeps me out to picture your form just being burned into a thermopedic.  You have a pedophilic.  Creep. 
[03:47:30]  Anthony, runner-up line of the day.  Oh, that a damn good one.  And E-Rock with the runner-up line of the day.  Today's line of the day is sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S.  in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on BodogFight.com.  I'm amazed that anything beat that line.  Here's today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:48:00]  Line of the day.  I heard my parents one time.  I got the call and it was like, it was, there was something sexual going on.  No way.  There wasn't.  And I was disgusted.  And then I heard my dad go, Jim, he's doing now.  That's a great line, man.  He does get me all the time with that. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  And even though I wound up pulling it out, I have to say pedophilic.  However you said it.  Pedophilic.  Pedophilic.  It's a damn good one.  A lot of questions out there.  Someone wants to know who has the better shut up, E-Rock or Jimmy?  I don't know.  Let's give it to E-Rock.  Let's go back to nine.  It's either Jimmy or E-Rock with the better shut up. 
[03:49:00]  He's got a good one.  All right, here's Jimmy's, right?  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that so bad?  You rarely sound douchey, man.  I got to tell you, Jimmy.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah, his is just...  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Ah!  Shut up.  You don't... 
[03:49:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I love it.  It's so bad.  I'm with you in that classroom.  I am in that class just looking at you going...  A lot of people saying it's a sham that Anthony didn't win with the Duck Hunt line.  No, I am always...  I like...  Oh, Duck Hunt was very funny.  ...happy with...  Oh, that was hack, though.  Come on.  All right.  Duck Hunt. 
[03:50:00]  Duck Hunt.  Let's get out of here.  Yeah, let's do that.  Dinner with the Hollanders got me all tired for today.  And I'm going to ask Ant to look at my computer specs.  Oh, look at your specs.  Yeah, I want you to look at my specs.  My shaved specs.  Oh, computer.  Sorry.  Let's go share a piece of cheesecake.  Yeah.  Let's all do that.  Two forks for us, please.  Ugh.  Ugh.  This is a very special show.  It's about being able to do the show we want to do.  Prison specs.  Give it to me. 
[03:50:30]  We know what guys want to hear on the radio.  Adult-oriented subject matter.  Look at those chugs.  They won't exercise restraint.  This is going to be an awful show.  Hold on tight, kids.  The O.D. and Anthony Show. </pre>
