<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with bizarre, nonsensical phrases like "boogie king, making favorite whoppers" and "Ding, pie, the done," repeated multiple times.  This was followed by a caller, Jim Brewer, recounting a vulgar and exaggerated story about a prank call he made to Sears, impersonating Muammar Qaddafi's mother, which resulted in a bomb threat.  A pre-recorded prank call bit, “Hi, Mom, I’m in Jail,” featuring vulgarity and exaggerations, was then played.  Adam Ferrari and Kay Marco joined the studio. The conversation turned to gay-themed television shows like "Queer as Folk" and "Oz," leading to sexually explicit conversations with Marco, who hosted his "Gay Marco Alternative Lifestyle Radio Program." This segment included sexually suggestive monologues, discussions of gay pornography, a reenactment of a pornographic scene, and sexually explicit banter with callers.  Marco promoted his column and a comedy album, "Homeless for the Holidays."  The segment concluded with a humorous reenactment of a supposed 911 call by O.J. Simpson and a discussion of top ten sports films, culminating in a sexually charged conversation referencing a scene from *Rocky*.

The next segment opened with a physical altercation between Opie, Anthony, and a person called "Mickey" involving a glass table.  A list of top sports films was discussed, interspersed with vulgar comments.  A female guest, Jill, was then brought in. The hosts, along with a female studio assistant, Ann, proceeded to drip hot wax onto Jill's stomach, buttocks, and breasts, while making numerous sexually explicit and crude comments. Jill removed her shirt and pants during this process. Following the waxing, the discussion shifted to an NRA-themed restaurant concept, with the hosts and callers brainstorming offensive and tasteless menu items referencing shootings, assassinations, and other violent events.

The show then extensively covered Imus's return to radio, focusing on his frail physical appearance and using derogatory language to describe his health condition.  The hosts mimicked Imus, exaggerating his health struggles for comedic effect.  This was followed by Anthony's lengthy recounting of his experiences with his ex-mother-in-law, detailing awkward encounters, her excessive drinking, and various incidents requiring Anthony to drive her home.  This was interspersed with interactions with Opie and callers.

The show concluded with "The King Gimp Game," where callers had to guess what King Gimp (from *King of the Hill*) said in difficult-to-understand audio clips.  Despite the difficulty, every caller correctly guessed, with the multiple-choice answers often being humorous and absurd.  Further conversation and humorous commentary from the hosts and callers followed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Anthony, you've got a great instant feedback here from Mark from Jersey.  This morning I was flipping through the channels and I passed by MSNBC while Mr. Imus was on.  Imus made his return to radio this morning.  Yeah, I heard about that.  The guy is so feeble now that he wears oxygen to do his show.  Why doesn't the guy put his other foot in the grave?  Let me tell you something.  We do want to welcome Mr. Imus back to the radio airwaves, but I saw the same thing this morning.  It was a mess. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, perhaps you should start slow and just maybe do the radio show and wait on the CNBC thing until at least there's no medical equipment in the studio.  Right.  I don't think it's a good thing to turn on a radio show on the TV and see medical equipment.  If you want to see a freak show, turn on MSNBC tomorrow morning.  This is what I saw.  I was flipping around and I didn't even know he came back today and I'm like, oh, Imus, rerun, whatever.  And I realized quickly that it wasn't rerun because he was talking about the Roger Clemens beanball to Mike Piazza's hat. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  What you saw on TV was Imus, he hasn't shaved in about four weeks.  Oh, no.  So really scraggly, gray beard.  The gray beard, yeah.  Pasty white skin, really thin in the face, okay?  Losing weight, being in the hospital, sure.  Wrinkles all over his face.  The biggest cowboy hat I've ever seen.  A big, giant, fag cowboy hat.  It doesn't even fit his hat.  It's just huge, okay?  He's got sunglasses on.  And the cowboy hat is pretty much hiding his whole face as he's trying to do radio this morning. 
[00:01:30]  And he looks up and just like that guy said on the instant feedback, he has breathing tubes in his nose.  You know when you see like Grandpa in the hospital and he's got the plastic breathing tubes in his nose?  Yeah, the rubber tube that goes over your ears and to an oxygen tank.  Right.  That's how he was doing his show today.  No, you know, that's how he was doing his show today.  Oh, my God.  See, now no one would know this if it was just the radio. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  Why would you agree to that?  God forbid something happens to us and, you know, we have to come back on the radio.  Let's say they're broadcasting a show on TV.  Would you ever agree to have your, you know, sick face on the tube while you're recuperating?  Bernard, wheel the gurney up to the microphone.  Could you do that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's seven o'clock on the Imus in the Morning program. 
[00:02:30]  Hey, McCord, check my pulse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, do you see the, uh, that, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, wait a minute, I'm feeling a little, uh, fibrillation.  Uh, Bernard.  Oh, Bernard, get the paddles.  Yeah.  Oh.  Uh, seven o'clock, Imus in the Morning program.  What? 
[00:03:00]  Could someone, uh, dial up my oxygen a little bit?  And I need a bigger fag cowboy hat.  Uh, some of my, uh, my, uh, neck fat is, uh, turning green.  I need the, uh, bandana.  Wait.  Um, uh, uh, you see the, uh, Met Yanks?  Uh, seven o'clock, Imus in the Morning program.  Quack, quack.  What's, uh, so, uh, what was I saying? 
[00:03:30]  Did you see the, uh, Met Yankee games?  Yeah, I think you were talking about, uh, Roger Clemens, Beam, and Mike Piazza.  I'm in, uh, I'm in perfect health.  I'm, uh, uh.  McCord, grab the paddles.  Oh!  Seven o'clock, Imus in the Morning.  How the hell am I supposed to do a, uh, program when I'm, uh, dying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Moby Worm coming to get you, baby.  You see the, uh, bandana I have around my neck? 
[00:04:00]  Ah, yes, I do.  It's hiding a trach tube.  Jesus.  And, uh, my big fag cowboy hat is hiding, uh, a power generator that's keeping my heart going.  Why does my equipment keep turning on?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Your equipment is malfunctioning, Mr. Imus.  Uh, Bill, what's going on?  Bill.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I was wondering if the, uh, the whole new oxygen tube, the, that's called the nasal cannula.  But I was wondering if that was one of the props for his characters.  Because doesn't Imus use characters? 
[00:04:30]  Mr. Imus uses characters.  Yeah, Mr. Imus uses characters.  Did you see that this morning?  No, no.  I did a radio show with the breathing tubes, man.  That's, that's gotta be a real drag.  That's just brutal.  It is brutal.  It was kind of sad to watch.  Maybe he's practicing for like a telethon or something.  Yeah, send your money into the Imus in the morning get well program.  Yeah, all right.  So you want to talk about Clemens, you said, Mr. Imus.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Okay.  And I think it was a bean ball.  Yeah.  I think it really, you know, ah, shut up.  You're getting me all upset.  Get the paddles, Bernard.  Get the paddles.  Oh, that feels better.  I think I'm back on rhythm.  Where's my horse?  Destiny.  Come on, Destiny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, baby.  Someone shoot that goddamn horse. 
[00:05:30]  Whoa, Destiny.  Someone turn my machine.  Goddamn, only five minutes into my program.  I've already had to be revived five times.  Uh-oh.  What the hell's that?  Double heartbeat.  Someone shot me.  Bernard, grab the paddle. 
[00:06:00]  McCord, grab the paddle, kid, jerk.  Someone, please help me.  Oh, that's better.  Imus in the morning.  7.07.  Goddamn, this is painful.  I'm truly a shock jock.  You gotta shock me every goddamn five minutes just to keep me alive, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, Destiny. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, baby.  Collapsed lung coming to get you.  Packing up my big fat cowboy hat and head out west.  Gonna try to ride a horse with my brother.  And still comes closer, baby.  Destiny.  And then I'm gonna get butted off.  And crack some ribs.  Shock me.  Oh, baby.  Oh, baby.  Oh, baby.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Snake some tubes down my nose, baby.  Why the hell is a 60-year-old man on a horse?  Oh, shot me.  Bernard, Bernard.  That's the guy.  Tell Tom, I want to be a cowboy, baby.  Someone check my colostomy bag. 
[00:07:30]  Cowboy, baby.  Yeah, my jaw's wired shut.  Cowboy, baby.  Riding at night and laying in the hospital for two weeks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whoa.  Mr. Imus.  Mr. Imus.  Oh, you're there.  Oh, hell, my equipment went on.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Oh, my God.  I just noticed those MSNBC cameras are on. 
[00:08:00]  I didn't get to hear his show this morning.  It was painful.  I'll tune in now tomorrow just to see him with the tube.  I encourage everyone to tune in tomorrow.  Check out Imus with the breathing tubes trying to do a radio show.  Yeah.  It's a prop act.  It's a prop act now, yeah.  Prop act.  He looks like Mr. Burns.  O.B. 
[00:08:30]  O.B.  Anthony.  O.G.  T.  W.N.E.W.  E.  How is she not right?  Is she insane?  Will she know?  One more life, one more thought that ends this day.  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Why is she not right?  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Will she know?  One more life, one more thought that ends this day.  Is she not right? 
[00:09:00]  Is she insane?  Will she know?  One more life, one more life, one more thought that ends this day.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, Anthony.  Yes.  Why don't we go right to Uncle John and see what he has?  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned a couple of things tonight.  Yeah.  I learned not to invite Opie over for the weekend because he might stay for a year  and a half.  Yeah.  That's a good story to tell.  Yeah, I just lost my mother-in-law.  Cool.  Oh, my God.  I did it twice.  Yeah.  I also learned...  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to back up a bit. 
[00:09:30]  I forgot I did it twice.  When we first went up to Boston, we were staying with my mother-in-law for, like, I stayed  there a few weeks, maybe.  Barely.  Yeah.  Barely.  Maybe two weeks.  And moved right out.  Right.  Opie stayed there how long?  I'm gone.  I'm in my own place now.  And Opie and my mother-in-law living in the house for how long?  I lived with your mother-in-law for nine to ten months. 
[00:10:00]  Nine to ten months.  She's not trying to squeeze you for alimony?  The house gets from hell.  And he was breaking stuff.  Oh.  Like, you are terrible.  You broke this little tchotchke.  No, I'm not as...  But I'm not as angry anymore.  And I'm okay now.  I was at it.  No, you...  Like, you would just be clumsy.  Yeah.  You pulled the phone cord and it hit this little figurine and broke.  Her phone cord was 40 to 50 feet long, which is very dangerous in an older lady's house  because they have all those trinkets around. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ, Rick.  Did you see her naked?  Opie, I'm feeling a little lonely.  Get me the grandma yay and scotch.  And get your ass off.  You did see her naked.  You don't say it.  Oh, did you see her naked?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, yes.  I'll play along.  I saw Anthony's ex-mobile on naked.  Oh.  Of course I did. 
[00:11:00]  Get me my scotch.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  But we're hanging out and Jay's here and Opie and Sandy and we're all, you know, hanging  out.  We're in the restaurant and it's very early and we want to have...  I want to go home now.  I want to go home.  We make plans to go out and I'm like, yeah, cool.  We'll go out and stuff.  And then Jen would say, oh, let's take mom.  I'm like, no, I don't...  I really... 
[00:11:30]  You know, it's just us hanging out.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Oh, my God.  Why do we have to take mom every time?  I just want to go out and hang out with everybody and have a good time and now we got to take  mom?  Fine.  You know, she doesn't ask for...  And, you know, this happened and this and this and this and a whole laundry list of crap  and the reason why we should take it, you know, something.  Fine.  Fine.  We got to leave right now.  I just want to go.  Thank you for taking me, Anthony. 
[00:12:00]  Thank you for going out to dinner.  This is a lot of fun.  Okay, great.  An hour into it.  I'll take another scotch.  I'll take a scotch.  An hour and 15 minutes into it.  I want to go home.  Jen, could you tell your mom that we're still hanging?  I'm having fun.  I'm hanging out with Jay and Opie and we're laughing our balls up and stuff. 
[00:12:30]  I want to go home.  Okay, Opie, Jay, bye.  No, yeah, it was a lot of fun hanging out.  But now I got to take a drunken mother-in-law home.  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  The best, though, is she would pass out on our buddy Jay's shoulder on the way home.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Pass out on poor Jay's shoulder.  Or lap.  They'd take me home.  She would.  Her head would be right in Jay's lap.  No, that's not even a joke.  She'd pass out.  Right. 
[00:13:00]  She'd pass out right there.  I want to go home.  And I'll be having fun.  No, we weren't.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, was I getting into something?  Well, who am I to say?  Opie, can you rub my cons?  Opie, touch my dirty spot.  You have gone too far. 
[00:13:30]  You have gone too far.  I don't know how you did it.  I don't know how you'd stay there for that long.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  I hope was Anthony's ex-motherland the reason you sewed your pants that night going into the bar?  See, that was years before.  Later, dude.  Have a good trip.  And then how about when the goddamn dog died?  Goddamn dog death dedication.  When the goddamn dog died and she put the ashes in the urn and put it up in the living room. 
[00:14:00]  Well, just like from Meet the Parents.  I was creeped out every time.  There's the dead dog there.  And when I die, I want my ashes put together with chesters and we're going to be buried together.  I want to go home.  I'm having fun.  I want to go home.  Oh, believe me.  It was like, you know, because I like to pace myself and have a good time, especially, let me tell you, especially when it's me, Opie and Jay hanging out. 
[00:14:30]  Because we would laugh so hard and come up with all this off-the-wall fun stuff, worked great for the show.  And I'd be just getting started.  I got to go home now.  I got to go home now.  I got to go home.  Son of a mother F, bitch.  And there we were going home.  At like 10, 15.  Because you know why?  You know why?  You could email or call and say, Ant, you know, why didn't you not be a pussy and go? 
[00:15:00]  Because if I didn't go home right then and there, it would just be worse.  It'd be worse.  If mom didn't get to go, worse.  I'd listen.  I'd hear it all night from the ex all night.  Why couldn't mom go?  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Am I getting ahead of myself again?  Oh, what?  What, Opie?  No.  We ended our radio show hours ago, Ant.  It's just you and I in our office. 
[00:15:30]  Opie, my legs smooth.  Easy.  I just lotion.  Oh, come on.  It's all in fun.  She was very nice to me.  Of course she was.  Yes.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Opie, if you don't want to talk to me anymore, that's fine.  We live here for nine months.  We eat you and Chester's arches.  And if you don't want to call me, fine. 
[00:16:00]  I'm not going to chase you.  Come here, Chester.  Get the urn.  I'll pet the urn until I die.  And then we mix the arches and me and Chester go to eternity together.  Opie, if you're in that effing bar.  If you're in that effing bar, I'm not going to chase you.  We had a great relationship.  You lived here for nine months.  Me and you and Chester.  Come here, Chester.  I know you can't walk anymore. 
[00:16:30]  I'll put you on wheels.  Say hi to Chester.  Chester walked just fine.  Chester.  Every.  Oh, my God.  When we had to eat there?  Come over.  I'm making turkey.  All right.  Coming over for dinner.  This dog was so effing spoiled rotten.  You'd sit there.  And she didn't care.  The goddamn dog could jump up on the plate and start eating out of her plate.  And she'd be like, look at how cute Chester is. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm sitting there like, if that dog comes near me, I swear to God, I am going to smack it in the nose.  And it would sit there.  This is where you get the entire time you're eating.  Picture it.  Picture it the whole time.  But, Anthony, you're missing one sound.  But.  Oh, yeah.  And why did it make that sound?  That was when you kick it under the table because it's after your food. 
[00:17:30]  You'd have to give it a smack.  Smack that, Chester.  And just try.  The whole time.  For an hour.  Anthony, if you're going to the fridge, could you get me a glass of wine out of the box?  The box.  The box wine is the best wine.  It's the cheapest.  Make me a Captain Morgan.  Captain.  Captain of Coke with a twist of lime.  And my box wine and some scratch and some crummy egg.  And now I want to go home. 
[00:18:00]  You are home.  Oh.  I want to go out.  Unbelievable.  Look, man.  I don't know this guy.  What?  What?  What?  I just came in to do a radio.  What happened?  I don't want to be called it.  I'm able to unleash.  I can unleash.  I'm paying enough.  I should be able to talk about it.  That's right.  It's taking the knife out of the cheese.  You think you want some cheese, Chester? 
[00:18:30]  Hey, uh.  Anthony, I got a little job for you.  When you come up, could you install a new garage door and garage door opener?  And I, that's my weekend.  I swear to God, it was a mission every weekend.  When I was living in New York doing construction.  And I'd come up for Christmas vacation or something.  Believe me, for me, a vacation was great.  Now it's like, you know, this is vacation.  It's nice to get away.  But it's not like we're working here. 
[00:19:00]  When I was working, vacations were cherished.  Cherished.  Every Christmas, there we are, going up to Boston, where I would have to do some type of construction work around the house because that was it.  Could you install an air conditioning vent into my den?  Oh, my God.  You know, Jennifer, why do I have to go and do the work I do?  This is what I do.  I install air conditioning ducts on my vacation.  God damn it. 
[00:19:30]  My mother doesn't ask for a lot.  Oh!  Could you knock this wall down and put it in a bar?  Could you pick up Ani Mag?  A banana Ani Mag.  She's dead.  Remember the Ani Mag stories?  I used to love her.  She's now dead.  Ani Mag.  Ani Mag was actually pretty cool.  Learn Anthony needs to see a doctor.  What?  Just talking.  What?  People are looking at me all horrified around here. 
[00:20:00]  People are turning down their radio.  I go home.  Just taking a little listen.  It's about time.  It's what I've been thinking.  Who are you wearing?  I'm wearing a Chester.  To the Oscars.  It's Chester.  Hey, um.  You're wearing a Chester Hill figure.  It's wonderful.  Love the gray fur.  How long have I been here? 
[00:20:30]  Two minutes.  Seems like an hour.  What?  Oh, nothing.  I'm just sitting back listening.  Like everyone else.  Could you install a garage door opener? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, okay, what's that?  What's that take?  Go to C.S., go to the mall in Birmingham, pick up a garage door opener, and install it.  Great, it's my vacation.  Cool, cool.  What am I going to do on vacation?  Let me drive all the way to Massachusetts to put in a garage door opener.  This is great.  I'm enjoying the hell out of myself.  Could you install a tap in the wall for my box of wine?  It's a box of wine, a box.  Oh, my God, and then once Jen got that job at the liquor store, whoo-hoo, a discount. 
[00:21:30]  I could step up to the building, a box of wine.  It's like, gee, Mom's in again.  I want to go home.  Can I?  What?  You were there.  You were there for the whole thing, Opie.  Don't look so shocked.  No, I want to remind you of something.  Oh, no, what?  We'll be back.  Oh, yeah, I remember that. 
[00:22:00]  Thanks for that, Opie, that little tidbit.  I don't know how I blocked it out, because it was a nightly occurrence.  There I am, starting a brand new career in radio. 
[00:22:30]  Thanks to who?  Really trying.  Opie.  Huh?  Who?  Who?  Opie.  What?  That's right, Opie.  Okay.  Absolutely.  You should get a divorce from me, and I wouldn't have a leg to stand on.  And every friggin' night, I get the call from the house, because the both of them are sitting  there, you know, having some cocktails, having a couple of cocktails, some mother-daughter  cocktails.  Totally, like, tanked. 
[00:23:00]  And I get the phone call.  And I would have to drive to the mother's house, because she wouldn't drive Jennifer home,  for some reason.  You had to pass your house.  Yeah.  I had to pass my house.  Meanwhile, she, the mother would pick up Jennifer from the liquor store, and instead of driving 
[00:23:30]  her home, would drive her to her house.  Drop her off.  You know why?  I want to go home.  Because going there to pick her up was never going to pick her up.  Sit down and have a cocktail.  Pet the, uh, the Chesterton.  Say hello.  Hello.  Well, and I'd have to sit there, but thank God something good was on TV.  They would tape General Hospital and then watch it once I got there. 
[00:24:00]  For some reason.  Like, because Jennifer would have gotten home, and the mother taped the soap opera so Jennifer  could watch it.  But they had something else to watch until, like, 7 o'clock or 7.30 when I got there.  All right, we're going to watch the soap opera.  Get me, could you get a box of wine?  Give me a scotch.  Oh, my God.  I love that John Black.  Seth and O'Jimera is a scumbag.  What?  No.  What's the matter?  Why am I being looked at so strangely? 
[00:24:30]  Anthony's lawyer checking in.  Stop, Anthony.  Stop now.  Tony!  God damn, you guys are messed up.  And I feel your pain.  Oof.  I don't feel any pain.  No kidding, you box wine drinking hobo.  But I want to go home.  It's like the new Anne.  He's starting to...  Oh, yeah, the new Anne.  To blow off steam.  It's therapy.  It is therapy.  Well, I was fine with leaving it alone.  But you're doing, like, soliloquies.  I mean, when you get into this...  When he gets into this, though, it's like... 
[00:25:00]  It's not a conversation.  You just sit back and listen until he's done.  Okay.  Here he goes again.  Right.  He's off and running.  But I had completely blocked out the time we were flying from Boston to Los Angeles.  To Los Angeles, right.  And at this time, the significant others were still in New York.  We were living at my mother-in-law's house.  Correct.  And Opie has to remind me that for a 10-minute drive, we needed a lift to what is called the Logan Shuttle. 
[00:25:30]  It's a bus.  We wanted a ride to Logan Airport, which was 45 minutes away.  I can't drive to Logan.  I don't like driving all the way to the airport.  Don't like it.  I want to stay home.  But we're begging because we don't know the area yet.  Right.  We don't know nothing of the area.  So she said she'll drop us off at the Logan Shuttle.  The Logan Express is a bus that'll take you to the airport.  It's a few minutes away. 
[00:26:00]  So we all get in the car, and she drives, which later on, after we had lived there a while,  we realized where she was taking us was probably a 10-minute drive.  You get on a road, you get on another road, and you're there.  It took us about 45 minutes to get to this place because I had blocked this out whenever the mother-in-law would take us anywhere.  I can't make left turns.  I can't make a left turn, but three rights makes a left. 
[00:26:30]  And I always take the side streets.  I always take the back roads because I don't like the highways.  Highways?  It's Route 9, if you're familiar with Boston.  It's not...  Well, it's like Jericho Turnpike on the island.  It's not I can't take lefts.  She's afraid.  I'm afraid to make left-hand tins.  Afraid.  So we sat there on this Mr. Toad's wild ride through the backwoods of suburban Massachusetts 
[00:27:00]  when we realized later on this is a 10-minute drive.  And she's driving us, you know, to the Logan Shop because I can't drive to the airport.  We almost missed our flight.  Remember that?  Mm-hmm.  I can't.  I choose not to make left-hand tins.  But even better, remember when you had to go to Annie Mark's?  Annie Mark's.  That was the best story that you told at lunch today.  To this day, I couldn't tell you how to get there because it was this maze thing.  She should drive for the mob when you're trying to take a prisoner to the camp. 
[00:27:30]  You wouldn't even have to blindfold them.  I couldn't remember where we were.  We'd be driving down these back roads.  And, you know, I'd be driving in my car.  She's in the back seat going, all right, make a left here.  Now, turn, make a right.  I don't know how to make the left, so we're just going to take the way I take, which is a bunch of right-hand tins.  Make a right.  Make a right.  And I'm driving in circles.  During this way and later, after living there a while, I realized, again, had to be a five-minute drive. 
[00:28:00]  Five-minute drive.  It took a half hour.  But the funny part about that story, she wasn't driving.  You were driving.  She was giving directions with all right turns.  I don't even like being in the car during left-hand turns.  And she finally told you that the reason, yeah, she went that way was because she doesn't like left-hand turns.  And she didn't know how to get there.  Dude, she did not know how to get there telling me how to get there by making left turns because she never had done it.  So I'm like, why are we making a right? 
[00:28:30]  I know it's got to be this way because the town that we were going to is that way.  Well, Anthony, because...  Make a right.  Okay.  Go up.  Make a right.  Now, make this right.  Like three rights.  It's a left.  Three rights.  Make a left.  Three rights.  Make a left.  Where's my scotch?  Get the box of wine.  Unbelievable.  Thank you for refreshing my memory.  I'm sure you'll come up with a bunch more, Opie.  Opie remembers.  As he takes pleasure in saying, his aunt, remember this time Judy did this? 
[00:29:00]  I'm like, ah!  I blocked it off!  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I got a guy that works with us that does not make left turns, and he's a service tech.  He drives all day long on the island, and when he goes into Manhattan, he's a total nightmare.  He just keeps going right and right and right and right to get back.  So he doesn't make lefts either?  No, not at all.  He's, like, petrified of it.  It's crazy.  And when anybody else drives with him, it makes us nuts driving with him.  You'd have to be a goddamn lunatic to make a left-hand tune. 
[00:29:30]  I stick to rights, because then I only got to look one way.  It's a right tune.  Your brother wants in on this.  Joe.  Hey, Joe.  That kook.  Ant, what about the time that we played up at, uh, I forget the name of the place.  Oh, God damn.  We were playing, and you had to take the van that we moved the equipment in to take her home.  Dude, that was an I want to go home story.  Oh, get this.  Rotgut's playing.  We live down in New York. 
[00:30:00]  We got a gig up in Boston.  Kind of exciting and fun for a band.  So, um, Judy wants to go.  I want to go and see Rotgut.  So, all right, we pile in.  She drives with one of her friends.  Not with us.  She gets there.  Her friend leaves her there.  Because Judy goes, I want to stay and watch the band.  So, the friend leaves.  End of the night comes.  We just get done with the set.  I want to hang out. 
[00:30:30]  I want to go home.  Like, you want to hang with the band?  We're having a good time.  We're up in Boston.  This is kick-ass.  I want to go home.  I go to my brother, Joe.  I got to take the band.  The equipment's going to be loaded in shortly.  Just move the equipment off the stage.  And I will be right back.  I am just taking Judy home.  I know nothing of the area.  Judy's going to give me directions on how to get from Boston, the club, to about 20 miles in the suburbs to her house.  I was lost.  So lost. 
[00:31:00]  She's drunk off her ass on the front seat.  And I'm looking at my watch going, the band thinks I'm dead.  Because I've got to be dead.  Oh, yeah.  We definitely thought you got into some kind of horrible, disfiguring accident.  The equipment now is being either locked in the club for the night or moved out into the snow.  Where the band's got nowhere to load the equipment.  As I'm driving Judy around, now the truck's running out of gas.  Judy, where's the gas station?  I don't know.  I've got to go home.  I don't know where there's one in Ashland.  And she's flopping all over the seat. 
[00:31:30]  Dude, I was getting so pissed.  I started jamming on the brakes just to watch her flop into the footwell.  And then, like, pull her back up on the seat.  Do you have any idea where we are?  No, this doesn't look familiar.  Finally, finally, get her home.  I swear, I just about slowed the van down and pushed her out in front of the house.  I just got back maybe two or two and a half hours after I left. 
[00:32:00]  It was supposed to be maybe a 45 to 50 minute trip.  Like an hour tops round trip.  Two and a half hours later, I come back to a van that wanted to effing kill me.  It was closer to three and a half hours.  Yeah.  They wanted to kill me.  I thought for sure you got, you know, you had an accident.  Yeah.  And there's Judy, 90 pounds, soaking wet, flopping around the cab of this truck, hammered.  I don't know.  What road are we on?  Now, here's your mistake. 
[00:32:30]  You made a left turn.  You made the mistake because you made a left turn.  Yeah, we moved the stuff out into the street that night.  Anthony, what are we going to do about this?  Stay in the seat.  Where are we?  I have no clue where we are, Judy.  You have to look around.  Tell me which way to go.  We are on Route 9 somewhere in Natick.  Natick?  I know a great place for fried clams and steamers right up the road. 
[00:33:00]  Judy, it's three in the morning.  Oh, I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Can we stop and get a box of wine?  I swear to God.  So when I finally got back, yeah, the guys were fuming and pissed.  But that right there is an example of I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Thanks for the reminder, Joe.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Steve, what's going on?  It's N.E.W.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Opie, wasn't there a situation at the mother-in-law's house about a painting or a poster? 
[00:33:30]  Where she took my picture down because...  Yeah, that was it.  That was it.  Oh, there was the picture of the Demented World cover.  Right.  That's right.  That she had up on the wall.  And then when...  Probably displayed.  The marriage went on the fritz.  She was like, I just feel bad that I also have to get rid of Opie.  A picture of Opie.  Oh, they're together.  So, yeah, she felt kind of bad about that.  Did she like Opie better than you?  Well, she probably does now. 
[00:34:00]  I'll tell you that one.  She could have just cut you out of the Demented World picture and kept it hanging.  There you go.  Take care, guys.  All right, Steve.  I want to go home.  Thanks for the memories.  Cool.  I want to go home.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Yes.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  The Alty and Anthony Show.  I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East.  No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus.  They have different religious beliefs.  They believe in Muhammad and not in our holiday. 
[00:34:30]  And so every December I go to the Middle East and say...  Hey there, Mr. Muslim!  Merry f***ing Christmas!  Put down that book, the Koran, and here's some holiday wishes.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Muslim ass and f***ing celebrate.  There is no holiday season in India, I've heard.  They don't hang up their stockings and that is just absurd. 
[00:35:00]  They never read a Christmas story.  They don't know what Rudolph is about.  And that is why in December I'll go to India and try out.  Hey there, Mr. Hinduist!  Merry f***ing Christmas!  Drink eggnog and eat some beef and pass it to the masses.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Hindu ass and f***ing celebrate.  Now I heard that in Japan, everyone just lives in sin. 
[00:35:30]  They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.  On December 25th, all they do is eat a cake.  And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and...  Hi there, Mr. Shintoist!  Merry f***ing Christmas!  God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.  In case you haven't noticed, there's best no things to do.  So let's all rejoice for Jesus!  Merry f***ing Christmas to you! 
[00:36:00]  On Christmas Day, I travel around the world and say...  Now it's Christmas bonus and all you atheists, too!  Merry f***ing Christmas to you!  Thank you, Mr. Hand.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Alright, we're talking about King Gimp.  We just saw the automatic door scene. 
[00:36:30]  My God.  He's trying to get through an automatic door.  And it opens up, but he can't get through it before it closes again.  And he's like up against it and just totally freaking out.  Flailing.  His arms and legs are flailing, his head.  Oh.  Rob from Jersey.  If he couldn't stay in his chair at the Oscars because he was happy,  can you imagine what he would look like rubbing one out?  He would be flying around the room with his junk in his hand 
[00:37:00]  like a fire hose going full blast with no one holding it.  Yeah.  And everyone's talking about the popcorn scene.  They're queuing that one up for us, Ant.  Where he eats popcorn off the floor.  But it's time to play the King Gimp game, Ant.  Yeah.  Very easy game.  We're going to give you a King Gimp quote.  An actual quote lifted from the tape in King Gimp's own voice.  And he's actually saying something.  Yes.  We were going to have it where you just had to guess what he said. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  But it would be impossible.  It would be impossible.  So we will give you multiple choice.  Correct, Anthony.  Sounds like it's easy, doesn't it?  Yes.  And we got some great prizes today.  Can we give all this stuff away?  Anything we got?  No.  The O&A prize that I've been here.  We got Red Hot Chili Pepper tickets, Anthony,  to see the Foo Fighters July 14th at the PNC Arts Center.  Got tickets to see your buddy Adam Farrar.  Yes.  At the Toyota Comedy Festival.  How about it?  Stephen Lynch tickets for the Toyota Comedy Festival. 
[00:38:00]  Just an O&A prize package, which is basically CDs and stuff.  We have Warped Tour tickets featuring Green Day at Randall's Island,  Sunken Meadow, Saturday, July 15th.  No, we'll keep that one for another time.  And we have some Up and Smoke tickets.  Up and Smoke Tour tickets featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dog,  Ice Cube, and Eminem, July 19th at the Coliseum.  Up and Smoke.  Yo.  All right?  Yeah.  So let's play.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Chris, our first contestant.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you feeling today?  All right. 
[00:38:30]  You all right?  Okay, here's the King Gimp clip.  Listen closely.  We'll be right back. 
[00:39:00]  Okay, horrific.  You've got to be freaking kidding me.  Okay, horrific.  That's King Gimp, man.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll give you the multiple choice.  All right.  I'll pick C.  I'll pick C.  No, we'll give you the choices.  Why don't you give them the choices, then?  I don't have them with me.  All right.  I got them here.  We were supposed to get two copies of this.  That's okay.  Is King Gimp saying, A, sometimes people laugh at me, but a gimp is who I am. 
[00:39:30]  B, most people think gimp means someone with a lame walk, but gimp also means fighting spirit.  Or C, anytime I crap myself, I laugh because mom has to clean it up.  What is King Gimp saying?  Okay.  I'm going to take away my C answer.  Okay.  Did they put subtitles underneath that?  That's what they did? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Okay.  No, we figured it out.  What are you kidding?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Can you give me A and B again real quick?  A, sometimes people laugh at me, but a gimp is who I am.  Or B, most people think gimp means someone with a lame walk, but gimp also means fighting spirit.  We need an answer, Chris.  B.  B?  Is that your final answer?  Yeah.  We got a winner. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Now, would you like to see if that's indeed what he said?  Yeah.  Let's listen.  Listen closely.  What did he say?  This says, most people think gimp means someone with a lame walk, but gimp also means a fighting spirit.  King gimp, everyone.  King gimp.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, God. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I knew that from the beginning.  I heard some words in there.  You can make out a couple of the words.  Yeah.  Well, congrats.  All right, Chris, you won.  You won.  Hold on the line, all right?  All right, cool.  I think he's going to give you a nice prize there.  Thanks.  Maybe this is very easy.  Yeah, well, line one. 
[00:41:30]  Chris has won the King Gimp game.  We'll move right on to John here.  John, you want to play King Gimp?  Yeah, yeah, I want to play King Gimp.  All right, where are you calling from?  Clip to New Jersey.  All right, very good.  You've got to pay attention, okay?  All right.  All right.  Do we give the choices out?  No, we give the clip out first?  Yes, clip first.  All right, here's the clip.  Listen closely.  All right. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  What?  What the hell was that?  He said that while putting on a shirt, just to help you out a little bit, okay?  All right.  Did King Gimp say, A, that bitch needs a slap?  B, I think my hip just snapped.  Sorry.  And C, another day of crap.  I think it's C.  C, another day of crap?  Yes.  Bing, bing, bing.  Let me tell you, these multiple choice questions are ridiculous. 
[00:42:30]  What?  I knew you could go over the top.  I got it right?  Yeah, let's listen again.  Oh, no, no.  I don't know.  I had to keep fucking...  Another day of crap.  Rick, you're making it too easy.  Just like...  Well, that's all right.  Let me see.  Who cares?  John, you got a prize.  Hold on the line, all right?  All right.  I got this twice now. 
[00:43:00]  I need one and two or something.  No, which one you got?  You need three and four.  Okay, I got that now.  And you need all the clips, okay?  Let me see something.  You want to make sure it's a little harder?  It's getting better.  It's getting better?  What?  Just shut up, man.  I kind of laughed at the last one.  I think my hip snapped.  I'd be willing to bet on GIMP3 
[00:43:30]  that the guy will obviously get this.  All right.  I'll bet 20 bucks right now.  We're not cheap with our prizes.  It's okay.  I mean, you could make it a little harder.  All right, Rick.  Make it a little harder, all right?  A little harder.  All right.  We're easing into the game slowly, Anthony.  Easing slowly?  Hey, James.  Yeah.  You want to play the GIMP?  James, you win.  Do you want to play the King GIMP game?  We have plenty of stuff to give away. 
[00:44:00]  I don't care.  I'll play.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  East North Point.  Are you enjoying the King GIMP game?  Oh, yeah.  That's all that matters.  Even better watching it.  All right.  We're going to play the clip.  Listen closely.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  Whoa.  That's actual audio from King GIMP that was on HBO last night.  All right.  Don't worry, we'll give you the multiple choice.  You have to figure out what King Gimp is saying, all right?  Did King Gimp say, A, they wanted to kill me when I was born,  but I was bouncing so much the doctor couldn't catch me? 
[00:45:00]  B, they wanted...  Oh, my God.  I got something in my throat.  So, B, they wanted my mother to put me in an institution,  but she would never give me up.  Or C, did King Gimp say,  my father didn't want me, so he moved to L.A. and married a stripper?  B.  Of course it's King B. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, my God.  I would have bet $1,000 that you would have gotten it.  You would have had to have been King Gimp to miss that one.  All right, let's play the clip.  Of course, he said they wanted to kill me when I was born,  but I was bouncing so much the doctors couldn't catch me?  That's not what he said, Ed.  He said they wanted my mother to put me in an institution,  but she would never give me up.  Here it is.  One more time.  Oh, I heard institution there. 
[00:46:00]  Yes.  Very good.  James, you got a good ear for this.  Thanks.  The best quote is still to come, though, guys. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  All right.  We got a prize for you.  Hold on to the line, okay?  All right, thanks.  Stinky and Spaz will take care of you, so hold on.  All right.  Our own King Gimp, Spaz.  Yeah, Spaz looks like King Gimp.  If he would grow that beard.  Diet black, he is King Gimp.  All right, we're going to move on to question number four here.  Okay.  Andrew.  Yo, what's up, guys?  You want to play King Gimp?  Hell, yeah.  Now, this one's a little tougher.  I got to give Rick that much.  All right, this one's tough?  A little tougher.  All right, Andrew, listen closely.  All right. 
[00:47:00]  All right, here we go.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Sorry.  Like, you have to pick which one.  You're going to play the same one over and over.  I know.  All right, here's the one you have to listen to.  Here we go.  It's a little joke. 
[00:47:30]  I have no clue, guys.  Oh, we got to give you multiple choice.  Yes, Andrew.  Here we go.  Did King Gimp say, A, no one could understand that I was an intelligent person inside of this body?  B, everyone can laugh all they want.  I am smart and have a hot body. 
[00:48:00]  C, nobody understands that I am not crazy.  I am King Gimp.  Um, A.  Wow, another winner.  No one has lost this game yet.  I'm amazed.  You guys could read King Gimp.  We have a lot in common.  You guys speak King Gimp, I would say.  Tim checking in.  Tell Rick he's an A-hole.  Those answers are too easy.  All right, Andrew, hold on the line. 
[00:48:30]  You got a prize, too, coming to you.  All right, thanks, guys.  Later.  All right, line four.  Andrew has won the King Gimp game, Anthony.  You want to continue?  Uh, yeah, first of all, I got these, uh, the new ones, the new answers here.  Yeah.  Um, but he hasn't written down which are the real ones.  Right.  But without even hearing the clip, I want to slowly read through it and see if I can guess  which ones Rick wrote.  Okay.  What's another clip?  I...  Are you insane? 
[00:49:00]  What?  He's making me laugh today.  I got to...  Okay.  All right.  He's definitely...  I'm saying, before you even saw this one.  Uh, let's see.  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  Very good, Anthony.  Debbie, you want to play the King Gimp game?  Yeah.  Where are you calling from?  Merrick.  We might as well just give everyone the prizes.  I know.  All right.  Merrick.  All right, listen to the King Gimp quote and tell us what he's saying, okay? 
[00:49:30]  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  What?  That's not audio of our own Spanish. 
[00:50:00]  I was just going to say choking on something.  That sounds like the week in review.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  All right.  Let's see how good you are at...  I'll be the first person to lose, I'm sure.  Did King Gimp say, A, she is a beautiful girl who I would love to sleep with, but I don't think she likes me that way.  B, she has changed for the better because she isn't as uptight as she used to be.  Or C, this chick is such a hot piece of ass. 
[00:50:30]  I would love to TF her, but I'd probably take her eye out.  I'll go with B.  Of course it's B.  God damn, Rick.  Unbelievable.  Are we running out of prizes, Ben?  Are we running out of prizes?  This is good stuff.  Unbelievable.  We've given out everything.  It took us months to get these prizes, and we're giving them away because of the stupid game. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  Well, hold back some of the stuff.  I'll only give them like three choices or something, all right?  All right, Debbie, hold on the line.  What?  I just read six.  What, Ant?  What's wrong?  I thought you were making it tougher, Rick.  Well, the six is a little rougher, all right?  E.J.  What's going on, guys?  All right, you ready? 
[00:51:30]  I am ready.  Okay.  Listen to the quote.  I was trying to follow line by line, and I couldn't. 
[00:52:00]  Are any of these right?  Yeah.  All right.  Come on.  Of course.  All right, E.J.  Don't be the first to lose.  Okay.  Let's see what you got for me.  Did King Gimp say, A, sometimes when I'm alone, I cry because I'm not able to be normal,  but what can I do?  B, sometimes it does get lonely, but I don't really think about it much.  Or C, someday I will be able to have a family of retards of my own that I can make fun of, too.  We'll all go to hell. 
[00:52:30]  Jesus, Rick.  Uh, I'm going to guess B on this one.  You're going to guess B.  Yes.  We have another winner, it looks like.  Oh, fuck.  Now I just want to play to see if we go.  I've got to say, though, A and B were both pretty good answers, though.  Yes.  At least it wasn't dead giveaway.  Right.  Like T-F-ing her and poking her eye out.  Yeah, that's great.  The humor of Rick.  We're enjoying the humor of Rick today.  Comedy style of Rick.  Of Rick, our producer.  All right, EJ, hold on the line.  Thanks a lot, guys. 
[00:53:00]  You have won the King Gimp game, too.  Awesome.  Ron playing along at home on the instant feedback.  No, he didn't say conductor.  When do we reach Sloatsburg?  Matt, why don't you have the callers try to guess just one word that the Gimp is saying  without multiple choices.  John from Hoboken, I love your show, listen religiously every day, but I have to say the  King Gimp segment is truly tasteless and not funny.  Making fun of someone because of his medical condition they have no control over is completely 
[00:53:30]  heartless.  King Gimp has done an amazing job of leading a rather normal life, rather normal life, given  his severe medical condition.  It's not funny.  Wow.  Anyway, back to the King Gimp game.  Yeah.  One hour.  Come on.  I dare you to turn off the radio.  I think King Gimp's saying Jew down.  That's racist.  Ben Stein, Vernon, New Jersey.  All right, Ant, let's see if we can keep the record alive here. 
[00:54:00]  Six out of six people have won the King Gimp game.  Jim, what's easier to understand?  King Gimp or a dice when he calls in?  I think King Gimp makes more sense.  I'm over here now.  Yeah.  All right, we have the next King Gimp clip, Anthony.  Okay.  Well, I'm sorry.  That's not the, uh, that's not the King Gimp. 
[00:54:30]  Wait, here we go.  King Gimp, everyone.  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  Come on, be serious.  I have it.  Here it is.  All right, here it is.  You got it there?  Yeah.  Okay.  Come on!  No, that's...  No, I believe I have, uh, the next King Gimp, uh, quote, Anthony.  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, I'm over here now!  You must be mistaken, because I obviously have it over here.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Come on.  All right, Ant, stop fooling around.  We got people that want to play the King Gimp game.  Yes.  All right, here's the next quote.  Let us know what, uh, King Gimp is saying.  Okay.  Okay, brother.  How did I get in there?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Come on, now.  Have we run out of clips?  I don't know.  I think so.  Come on.  Okay.  All right, let's, uh, let's go back to the phones and play the King Gimp game. 
[00:55:30]  Okay, here's the next clip.  Can we see your stuff?  Easy.  Hey, Russ!  What's up, ONA?  What's up?  You having fun listening to the King Gimp game today?  Bro, I almost got in the full call, gracious.  All right, cool.  All right, don't be the first one to lose the King Gimp game.  Yeah, my luck, I probably will.  All right, uh, listen closely to the following quote from, uh, King Gimp that was on HBO last  night, and, uh, you just have to tell us what King Gimp is saying here. 
[00:56:00]  Here it is.  I feel, uh, I feel about it.  Well, it's a life with theP.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, that's what I was just about to say.  Okay, horrific.  All right, Russ, is King Gimp saying A, I had two people try and take advantage of me,  but I have some friends who said F that S.  B, I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me.  I was thinking F this S.  C, if the two professors tried to use me as a science experiment again,  I was going to bust a cap in their ass, F that S. 
[00:57:00]  Or D, we're adding even more answers to make it a little tougher, Anthony.  If those two professors had their way, I would not have been allowed in school.  F that S.  Russ, what did King Gimp say?  I'm going to go with A, guys.  A?  Yeah.  No, you are our first loser, Russ.  King Gimp did not say, I had two people try and take advantage of me,  but I have some friends who said F that S.  What King Gimp was saying is I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me. 
[00:57:30]  I was thinking F this S.  Here it is.  I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me.  I was thinking F this S.  The S. 
[00:58:00]  Fuck this shit.  Wow.  We just had a Kim Curson on our radio show.  I had no idea when we first played that clip.  The only word you can recognize is the S word in that.  Light FM checking in, Anthony.  Hello, we would be interested in hiring King Gimp for our next Light FM commercial  and possibly DJing for us as well.  Instead of a Valerie Small Don, you're going to have King Gimp on Light FM?  Let me tell you something.  No talk.  No, you haven't talked.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:58:30]  You want ratings.  You hired King Gimp to do a show opposite us.  I would even, we would listen.  Imagine that.  We would blow off our show to listen to that every day.  A talk show?  Or music?  Would he be a music jock?  No, a music jock.  So he talks a couple times now.  All right, we have one more contestant for King Gimp.  Yeah.  Thank God.  All right.  Ben from Suffering, New York.  I guess John the Dump Guy doesn't know King Gimp-ish either.  No.  Thank God.  Wayne from Tarrytown. 
[00:59:00]  This is not actually King Gimp.  Who is it?  A, Tom Brokenjaw.  B, Spaz.  C, Christopher Reeves.  Or D, Bob Hope.  All right.  Dennis.  I get it.  What's going on?  What's up, guys?  You want to play the King Gimp game?  Of course you do.  Absolutely.  And you've been having fun checking this game out today?  Yeah.  I think the Knicks found a new center.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Listen to the King Gimp quote and tell us what King Gimp is saying.  Very easy. 
[00:59:30]  Here we go.  Oh.  Ooh.  What?  Why are you laughing?  It's very obvious what he said.  What was that?  Was that Spaz's value-dictorian speech? 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Dennis, here we go.  Did King Gimp say, A, everyone loves a person who fights to preserve, but only I am the Gimp?  B, persevere.  I'm sorry.  Everyone loves a person who fights to persevere, but only I am the Gimp.  B, everyone has a handicap, but the way they deal with it is how you win.  C, everyone has a handicap, but only a few are the Gimp.  Or D, everyone has a handicap, but Jesus Christ, I'm really effed up.  This blows.  Someone, please, I've got to get laid. 
[01:00:30]  I've got to say D just for the hell of it.  What the hell?  We'll give you a prize.  Oh, we don't care.  We don't care.  Dennis, you lost, but you won.  All right, cool.  King Gimp said, Everyone has a handicap, but only a few are true Gimps.  All right.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  You sure that wasn't Patrick Ewing in between the third and fourth quarter the other night?  Well, Dennis, you're a winner, too.  What the hell?  All righty.  All right.  Hold on the line, and thanks for playing the King Gimp game.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  John checking in.  I think King Gimp said, Yo, B, I didn't steal no Coronas.  The Alty and Anthony Show. 
[01:01:30]  The Alty and Anthony Show.  I'm a good boogie king, making favorite whoppers.  I'm a paper hat.  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that? 
[01:02:00]  Ding, pie, the done.  Ding, pie, the done.  Ding, pie, the done.  Ding, pie, the done.  I gotta run.  I gotta run.  I gotta run.  I gotta run.  Don't bump her fries and hot fat.  It really hurts bad.  And so does skin graft.  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Where is the bell?  Wait for the bell.  Can't hear the bell.  Where is the bell?  Ding, pie, the done.  Ding, pie, the done.  Ding, pie, the done.  Ding, pie, the done.  I'm a boogie king, making favorite whoppers.  I would pay for hats. 
[01:02:30]  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Ding-ba-da-dun, ding-ba-da-dun, ding-ba-da-dun.  Ding-ba-da-dun.  I'm just sorry what is happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a biner?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I guess that's in teens' pants. 
[01:03:00]  All right, we're hanging with Jim Brewer today.  Okay, Scott.  We're ready to go here.  Joe, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  We're hanging with Brewer.  He's making us laugh.  Yeah, he's awesome.  He's awesome.  I'm a huge fan.  I actually started listening to you guys in November of 99,  and I'm just totally hooked.  You guys are absolutely awesome.  All right.  All right, Jim.  Jim, you totally rocked you, man.  There's a story I heard you tell that's absolutely awesome. 
[01:03:30]  I was hoping you could share with us again.  I think you used to work, like, at Sears or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The bomb threat?  The bomb threat?  You got it, man.  Oh, yeah.  Talk to me.  Talk to me.  What happened was I was 17, 18.  First of all, you're 17, 18.  I'm working at Sears in Valley Stream.  Well, no, boy.  It was one of you, and I worked with his hardcore stoner, and we would take, like, 40, we'd do  tag team 45-minute breaks.  I'd come in, like, my turn.  I'd leave for 45 minutes, talk to, like, the ice cream chicks. 
[01:04:00]  Anyway.  Well, your babies grew a lot this summer, aren't you?  So, anyway, you know, I'd call up.  There was this fat dude in a toy, Scott.  Scott's got something.  Every day I'd bust his balls.  I'd call, like, oh, I read in the paper there, Phil.  Can you go in the back and check if the spalding balls are there?  And I'd watch this fat dude go in the back.  And I don't want any damn rain shakes.  Do you understand me? 
[01:04:30]  Because I've been in there three times.  And if I come in with a rain shake, I'm stomping a mud hole in the paper.  All right, fatso?  And I'd go, oh, this is you.  That's you.  You call me fat.  She's kidding you.  How do you know I'm fat?  So, anyway, so we'd have fun, right?  So, one day, this guy's very serious.  Had to have been about almost 40 years old.  And he comes walking, and he's the only one.  You know, when you're wearing serious, they tell you, you must wear appropriate clothing.  And so, you know, we'd wear, like, black jeans. 
[01:05:00]  And a Chess King shirt, three for 99 bucks.  Remember, you had the one purple suit?  You are from Long Island, man.  It's 99 dollars.  You know what, Chess King with the black, it looks leather tie?  99 dollars, faggy.  Those dudes in appliances pay for real stuff.  99 dollars, I got three of them.  Anyway, so this guy bought one of his real suits from, like, Stearns or whatever. 
[01:05:30]  Loser places.  Oh, do we?  This doesn't matter.  Like we can.  Go ahead.  Wallets.  And he walks in the hardware, and we had a big rivalry, because I was in the paint department.  And paint was next to hardware, and we never crossed.  It was like Rosedale Valley Stream.  You guys stay on that side.  We'll stay here.  It'll be no trouble.  Hardware fairies.  And we played it seriously.  So anyway, this dude comes walking, and I'm looking at him, looking at him. 
[01:06:00]  And it's me and the stoner guy, and I go, and he comes back from hardware, and he goes,  Yo, that guy in hardware is really serious.  He just yelled at me for hanging there.  I went, really?  What do you mean yelled at?  He's like, yeah, he's very serious.  He's a dick.  So I go, all right.  So I call up, and at the time, it was, I think it was 1985 or 84.  Do you remember when we had the big thing going on with Libya?  Oh, yeah.  And Gaddafi, you know. 
[01:06:30]  Gaddafi shot six missiles.  I bombed him after that.  I hit his tent.  And he killed his daughter.  And on the way, we bombed the goddamn French for not letting us use their airspace.  Now, instead of launching missiles, I have to wake up next to a big-headed, Nancy, Mardi Gras float-head-looking Pez dispenser.  Goddamn.  Finger on the button one day, and a little rascal crapping my diapers the next. 
[01:07:00]  What happened?  Dude, are you guys a Kinnison fan?  Oh, yeah.  You're a Kinnison-ethic bomb delivery.  He goes, so we bombed Libya.  And he goes, but we made one mistake.  We accidentally bombed the French embassy.  And he goes, oh, well, I guess it must have been all those slingers.  They do it last time.  Kill the new house, you ass.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:07:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Where do you keep the little girl?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, dude.  Same.  Gaddafi, 84.  war. Yeah. What started  that whole thing was he shot  Gaddafi shot six  Libyan missiles  at a U.S. plane. Do you remember that?  Yeah. Anyway, what do you remember? That's the  history of the story.  Because we need some history  backup story. Those 
[01:08:00]  SNL people,  everything, SNL's like,  what's the back story? Who cares?  It's three minutes.  The God was  invented. I don't know.  It's just a guy that walks. He goes, hey, what is so  cheeseburger? Cheeseburger? Oh, yeah.  The guy grew up in Mexico.  Yeah, that sketch would have never  worked without the backup story. Yeah, you're right. Sorry.  Let's get a backup story here.  Sean, Sean.  So,  I get on the phone, and I 
[01:08:30]  swear, I swear to God,  I get on, and I go,  hello, this is Mumma Qaddafi.  Okay?  I swear to God, Mumma Qaddafi.  I am Mumma Qaddafi.  You know, the stone is behind me.  He's totally listening.  He's totally listening.  Yes.  This is Mumma Qaddafi,  and I have just sent six Libyan missiles  to hit your hardware department  in Sears Valley Stream,  you ugly,  wood-loving bastard. 
[01:09:00]  I hate the twos,  the twos are for faggot.  I am Mumma Qaddafi.  The missiles will hit you department.  You must run,  you hardware faggot.  Paint department rules.  Sears Valley Stream.  Oh, that's good.  Now,  I swear to God,  me and my friend,  this can't be real.  I swear to God.  I'm ready for those guys.  Matter of fact,  the guy I was working with,  I just worked in Miami,  and this kid I went to school with,  Scott,  I used to get all the high school kids,  oh, you gotta come to Sears, man. 
[01:09:30]  You charge a freaking brush for $8,  you walk out with a paint machine.  Don't tell anyone.  Yeah, Sears is what I always had to say,  oh, it's my father's birthday,  dude, can you look me up, man?  You know,  can you bring a little paintbrush up,  you know,  put the little sticker on,  you know,  all right, go ahead,  help this customer,  I'll wait here.  So now,  we're laughing our asses off,  me and this kid,  Scott,  we walk out of the room,  we go into the Sears break room, 
[01:10:00]  I'm cracking up,  I'm like,  ah, what a dick that guy is.  He's sitting,  and I could see him  writing everything down,  he's like,  he asked me three times,  who is this?  I said,  Mooma Qaddafi.  I go,  Mooma,  can you say it again?  I'm like,  is this guy retarded?  Mooma Qaddafi.  So we leave,  a short egg come walking back in,  and there's like,  nobody around.  So I'm looking around,  and all of a sudden,  you know the fake security guys?  Retta cops,  yeah.  Yeah, 
[01:10:30]  the retta cops.  Mall security guys.  They always have the little paper bags,  of,  what's in the house?  So they're like,  the wannabe undercover guys.  So he comes walking out from the back,  and he goes,  he goes,  Brewer,  and this guy hated me.  He hated me.  He was so into it,  I'd always go,  nice head.  What's in the bag?  Blow my cover.  Yeah,  you give me that little,  oh,  take it down,  Brewer.  So,  guy comes out.  I'm serious security,  goddammit. 
[01:11:00]  I'm undercover.  Undercover is serious.  Do the right,  Anthony,  it's a big difference.  Here's undercover.  We got a 321,  here are the screwdrivers,  a 321.  Please,  I need backup.  Where the hell  is the pretzel place?  They said,  next thing you know,  I'm here in fear,  but I don't know  where the hell  I'm at here.  Oh.  So I come out,  there's nobody there,  I'm looking around,  and all of a sudden,  this undercover guy  comes out and he goes, 
[01:11:30]  Brew,  what are you doing?  You got to get out  of the building,  we all got to get  out of the building.  There's been a bomb  call in,  and like a dick,  I thought he was  screwing with me,  and I went,  what are you talking about?  There's no bomb threat.  He goes,  the guy from Hardware,  Jerry,  the new guy in Hardware,  some guy he couldn't  understand called,  and I went,  oh my God.  I go,  no,  what is he,  a dick?  That was me.  You got to it right there.  I totally got to it. 
[01:12:00]  And his face,  we got the suspect  in custody.  Guys,  I am not lying.  His face went from,  I hope you're lying to me  because,  you know,  the fire department  is the police  running away.  This is like serious stuff.  Okay,  here's what happened,  all right?  Let's see you guys,  okay?  Talk me down  from that day. 
[01:12:30]  Brew,  please,  come out.  It's okay,  we got your mom here.  We're going to talk  you out of here.  No,  because I know,  you're going to arrest me,  man.  We understand,  no one's going to hurt you.  We understand it was a joke.  You're going to,  you're going to,  you're going to,  you're going to,  you're going to,  you're going to,  you're going to,  you're going to,  all right,  everybody,  drop the pink hands,  guys,  drop the pink hands.  We're going to go with plan B.  Listen,  listen,  here's what happened.  Here's what happened,  okay?  First of all,  tell us the location  of Muammar Gaddafi,  your counterpart.  There's no Muammar Gaddafi, 
[01:13:00]  dick.  Oh,  yeah,  oh,  here goes Muammar Gaddafi.  He's coming to Valley Stream,  and he's coming to Sears Valley Stream,  and he wants to bomb hardware.  Are you guys all geeks or not?  You heard it.  That's confession,  guys.  Nice.  Nice.  Hey,  so what the hell happened,  man?  So what happens,  I got down there,  thank God the cops didn't come yet,  and I have one of them PBA cards. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah,  those were for bond threats.  Look,  I'm with you guys,  you know what I'm saying?  I called in a bond threat,  but here's my PBA card.  What are you nuts?  Yeah,  I shot a guy down the road,  but look,  I got the plastic.  It might work if you run a red light,  but I don't know about this.  Listen,  guys,  we're cool,  so back off.  I hear OJ handed in one of the others,  hey,  it's okay,  I got a PBA card  from the last time the police were here  when I was beating her.  Cards got all blood on it. 
[01:14:00]  I'm with you,  baby.  The answer is  blood-soaked PBA card.  See,  I know I got friends in here  on the floor,  they're on the job.  Bloody PBA card.  Yo,  Randy Latt,  show me yours.  Show me yours.  So what happened was,  eventually,  and true story,  the guys,  I had to meet with  the district president  of Sears,  and how it really went down  was I went in there, 
[01:14:30]  and I met with this guy,  and I come walking in,  and he's behind his,  he's behind his table,  and I go,  walking in there,  and I go,  listen,  I go,  I'm very sorry,  first of all,  I straightened out  all the paint cans,  I put all the little  yellow for sale signs up,  all the easy living paints  were in order.  Easy living,  satin coat.  Satin fat.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something,  I can't tell you  how many houses  I've ruined. 
[01:15:00]  People would come in  and be like,  listen,  I'm redoing my exterior.  No matter what,  I don't say,  well then you want to go  with satin flat.  It doesn't matter,  right?  Well,  obviously,  you're going to need  the satin flat.  And then guys are coming  like,  man, 
[01:15:30]  that crap came  peeling off.  What?  Well,  did you prime it?  What do I prime it with?  Well,  the satin flat.  The satin flat.  You got to do four coats.  I'll give you a new one.  We all have to  our new receipt.  Get out of here.  That's classic.  Like you cared,  you know?  Oh, man,  I can't even tell you  how much I didn't care.  We've got to take a break.  We are so late.  We are so late.  Jim Brewer  making us all laugh today.  Our phone number,  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[01:16:00]  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Jason,  are you ready to play  Hi, Mom,  I'm in jail?  Yeah.  You got a good story?  Yeah.  What are you going to tell her?  I'm going to tell her  I had marijuana  and I got caught by the cops.  Will that piss her off?  Yep.  All right,  let's give her a shot.  Drugs.  Hello?  Mom?  What?  I screwed up.  What?  I'm in jail.  Why?  I'm in possession of marijuana.  You're kidding.  I don't know who to call. 
[01:16:30]  Should I call Uncle Mark?  It's my one phone call.  Should I call Uncle Mark or something?  I'll ask you.  Is this your one phone call?  I'll have to call him.  What do you need?  I don't know.  The call is being monitored, ma'am,  by the police department.  Okay.  What does he need to do?  The judge came in and set bail at $10,000.  It's a very serious offense.  $10,000?  Well, if it was a joint or two,  it would be one thing.  He was caught with 12 kilos in his trunk,  obviously trying to deal. 
[01:17:00]  So he's being arraigned as a dealer  and not as a user.  Okay.  Okay.  When is all this and when did...  Where are you...  Where is he and where can I come see him?  I mean, at the jail.  We're going to bring him to one of the city jails.  Okay.  How can I get directions to get there?  Can I get there, talk to him?  Tell me what I need to do. 
[01:17:30]  Mom, what should I do?  Like a lawyer?  Yeah.  You need a lawyer?  Well, he's been crying like a girl, too.  Well, he's...  I've got to get to the bottom of this.  He's a very good person.  I've heard that before.  It's more of that bad parenting.  I've seen this before with these kids.  They run the street...  They're running around the streets like wild.  And now they're selling drugs?  Did you know your son was doing this?  No.  No.  Not to mention with the...  Being found with a prostitute in the car? 
[01:18:00]  That's...  That's...  What is that all about?  Don't...  Don't even deny it, son.  Okay.  Please.  Don't even...  He's already given a full confession before he even talked to a lawyer, which just shows  how smart he is.  Okay.  Officer...  Sonny.  I didn't know what to do.  Okay.  Officer.  Yes, ma'am.  Please.  Please help me.  Okay?  I'm three hours away.  Please give me directions of how to get there and where you are, and I will be there. 
[01:18:30]  Well, by that time, he's going to be transported out of here.  I'm not sure where they're taking him, but I'm sure which jail we do take him to, they're  going to like him real good there tonight, if you know what I mean.  He's pretty good looking.  Yeah.  He better not drop that soap, if you know what I mean.  Please, sir.  I think Bubba's going to like him in the shower room, if you know what I mean, ma'am.  Listen, officer.  Yes, ma'am.  We...  You're a good family, blah, blah, blah.  I've heard it before, miss. 
[01:19:00]  I've heard it before.  Okay, you've heard it before.  All right, all right.  He's had enough.  I can't let this go anymore.  He's had enough.  Mom, you're on the radio.  Oh, my goodness.  Mom?  He couldn't take it anymore.  Mom?  What?  Hey, you're on the radio.  Huh?  It's a joke.  Oh, Jason.  Happy Mother's Day.  Happy Mother's Day, Mom.  Well, he is a good kid, but he's written out of the will. 
[01:19:30]  You know what we do here?  Absolutely nothing.  That's wonderful, isn't it?  You'll be an Anthony show.  All right, I do believe we're ready, Anthony.  Adam Ferrari in the studio.  I'm not ready.  Kay Marco in the studio.  Hey!  We're going to give him about 15 or 20 minutes of radio time to do whatever the hell he wants.  We do this from time to time.  These shows are quite successful because they're so goddamn annoying. 
[01:20:00]  But Marco, very well prepared for his little 20 minutes of radio.  He's very organized and tidy.  Well, I really tried to pitch my ideas in my column last week, and it sounds like you caught my pitch.  That's the first time you've pitched.  You seem the catcher type to me.  I'm a switch hitter, thank you so much.  Are you a top or a bottom?  Both.  That's just greedy.  With that Queer as Folk show that's on Showtime. 
[01:20:30]  It's hot.  If I could use the word blue past that the other day on TV.  And I stop, and I don't know what was going on, but there was some big guy.  You're not supposed to.  Thank God, right, Adam?  Sure.  There's some big burly guy at the door, and this little wormy guy is on the other side of the door.  And he starts talking dirty to the burly guy, who then comes in and gets on his knees and starts performing an act to the little wormy guy. 
[01:21:00]  And I'm like, these gay guys, you know, aside from it being gay and having to have to deal with, you know, man-ass and whatnot, they've got enough.  There's people knocking on the doors, and, hey, let me service you.  I've got a question for Gay Marco.  Yes.  What's hotter, Oz or Queer as Folk?  Oz.  You like Oz?  Yeah.  That's probably a very popular show with the gay guys.  You know why it's hot, because the guys are so dirty, and they're like, mm.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:21:30]  Marco, don't close your eyes.  And don't make that face.  So you like the dirty guys.  And there's a lot of male genitalia on that show.  I know.  That show is so hot.  And that one guy, I don't know their names, that Christopher, whatever his name is.  Mm.  Oh, he's so sexy.  Marco, can you cover up the naked guy on your shirt, please, somehow?  I hope he's got to stare at it.  Man-ass.  Don't stare at it.  Eat it.  Man-ass.  All right, I guess you're ready, huh?  Yeah, we will step aside.  The mic is yours.  And so is the Bill, the Pete, the Bob.  Well, anyone. 
[01:22:00]  And we can start the Gay Marco Alternative Lifestyle Radio Program.  No one's calling.  What happened?  What happened on the phone call?  Hey, what happened to our listeners?  Hey, guys, what?  I don't understand.  What happened?  We're all just having fun, right?  What happened?  All right, you want us to start the show with this song?  Yes.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hey, big boy. 
[01:22:30]  Why don't you come up and see me?  Oh, my God.  Hey, big boy.  Hey, it's the Gay Marco Alternative Lifestyle Radio Show.  Yeah.  Got ourselves a pretty little maggot.  It's like a giant gay disco in here.  Watch it, Opie.  You go, girl. 
[01:23:00]  Shake it, Rick.  Come on.  Shake that booty.  Anthony, put your shirt back on.  Why do straight guys have to dance with their hands over their head?  Don't they know how gay that looks?  It's time to go haunted.  God, this song brings back so many memories.  Drugs in the ladies' room.  Sex with the coat check boy.  Dancing till dawn.  It's hard to believe that was only five days ago. 
[01:23:30]  We can't see what I want to see.  And if I want to be this, we'll see you.  A big kiss.  Wah!  Hello!  To New York City, New York.  You're listening to the Gay Marco Show.  Fifteen minutes.  This just in.  Scott Muni just keeled over.  He had a heart attack.  Opie, you're not supposed to interrupt.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Marco, go ahead.  You're listening to the Gay Marco Show here on 1027 WNEW. 
[01:24:00]  Fifteen minutes of my massive gayness shoved down your throat.  212-757-1027.  I'll take some phone calls shortly.  But first, I just want to thank Opie and Anthony for this opportunity.  What a thrill this is for me.  I'm so excited.  I'm dripping.  And I promise I won't stay in the seat here.  But, I mean, who would have thought little gay Marco Santangelo from Geneseo, New York,  who would one day be here.  I mean, I used to play with my sister's Barbies, wear my mother's high heels, 
[01:24:30]  and then here I am in this fabulous city on this legendary radio station, WNEW,  extolling the joys of man-to-man stretching and bodily fluid swapping.  But for those of you who are not familiar with the O&A show, I'm an occasional guest on the program,  and I write a weekly column for FoundryMusic.com.  I hate to do this because I don't like breaking into the show,  but we do have one of Marconi's relatives, one of his ancestors, Marconi the Inventor Radio, on the phone. 
[01:25:00]  Go ahead.  Okay.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Marco.  Thank you.  So, I'm really enjoying the chance to be able to write for FoundryMusic.  It's been a real pleasure.  And like I said last week, I feel like I'm Opie and Anthony's very own personal version of Jessica Parker from Sex and the City.  Every week, you know, I sit in my bed with my little laptop, wearing my crop top,  ninsing t-shirt, and my shorty shorts, writing my column. 
[01:25:30]  Oh!  So, last week, I wrote a column pitching my idea for my own radio show, and so here I am.  So, I'm going to try to incorporate...  No!  I'm going to try to incorporate some of the ideas from my column into today's show,  as well as, you know, some other fun and exciting little things as well.  Okay?  I'm Big Dick Black.  I'm Big Dick Black.  Well, squeeze it! 
[01:26:00]  Well, one thing I did want to include was a co-host.  But, as you see, I'm going solo today.  And those of you who read my column know my dream co-host was Froy from Opie Anthony Message Board.  Anyways, we met here in the studio about six... 
[01:26:30]  I like talking, Jen!  We met here in the studio about six weeks ago, and it was love at first sight for me.  He is so hot.  And he's very young, but he's really hot.  I don't know how young he is, and I'm not quite sure what constitutes statutory rape in New Jersey,  but he's still very hot, and he's straight.  He's very straight, but he's hot.  And all you single girls in New Jersey, you know, look him up, because he's single, 
[01:27:00]  and he's sexy, and he's funny, and he's hung.  Did I say that?  Oh, no.  Excuse me.  So I contacted Froy, asking him if he would be my co-host, and he said,  unfortunately, he had to babysit after school.  So, you know, this made me realize I know why I don't date younger guys anymore,  because they're always too busy with either their homework or band practice or detention.  So now I only date guys over 19.  So I decided to go to the message board, because, you know, there's a lot of great talent on there, 
[01:27:30]  and maybe I could find another co-host.  And first I thought I really like Fez.  Not Fez from Ron and Fez, but Fez from the message board, and he's really very talented.  And he also writes a column.  Got milk?  He writes the second best column on foundrymusic.com.  And so I sent him an email.  Excuse me. 
[01:28:00]  So I wrote Fez.  And sight unseen, I have no idea what he looks like, so I didn't know what kind of chemistry we would have.  I still wrote him anyways, but he was busy too.  So I kept searching through the message board, and finally I came to Corpse Grinder Junk. 
[01:28:30]  Now, I thought this was very interesting, because, hey, he has junk in his name, and I like it in my mouth.  So I thought maybe we'd have something in common.  I'm just a flaming fag.  But, you know, his pictures that he posts there are just really frightening.  I mean, they really, really scare me.  So I passed on him, and I figured I could go at it alone and give it my best shot.  So here I am today.  And speaking of giving it my best shot, I have to say I love porn. 
[01:29:00]  I love porn videos.  But there's only two things I like about it.  I like the money shot, and I like the dialogue that leads up to, you know, the sex part.  So, you know, you always have to fast forward to get to the dialogue.  But this past Christmas, I got a DVD player from one of my holiday boyfriends.  You know, holiday boyfriends are those boyfriends you just keep long enough through the holidays to get lots of presents from.  And then you dump them afterwards.  You know, you dump them actually before New Year's.  You tell them, like, you need to get in touch with yourself, and you need your space.  And sometimes you've got to have three or four of these because you get more presents. 
[01:29:30]  So I have this really cool DVD player now.  And last week, I got my first gay porn DVD.  Saving Ryan's Privates.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[01:30:00]  Music or music.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  So I was so excited.  I finally had a gay DVD, and I could cut right to the dialogue parts and right to the money shots.  But, you know, it doesn't work that way.  They only go right to the sex part.  So you still have to fast forward to get to the dialogue. 
[01:30:30]  I just don't understand it.  But, you know, you really got to love these flimsy movie plots.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Hey.  So saving Ryan's Privates is a story of a boy from Iowa who joins the service and gets it in the **** and in the **** and everywhere else.  End of story.  So, now this, you know, this movie is a big comeback for Ryan Idol. 
[01:31:00]  He's a big porn star, like years ago.  And one night he did too many drugs and fell out a window or something.  And obviously he wasn't taking acting lessons while he was recovering.  But now, for your enjoyment, I would like to reenact a critical scene.  Can we see your stuff?  From saving Ryan's Privates, scene two, into the office of the commanding officer, walks Private Ryan.  Private Ryan Idol reporting for duty, sir.  At ease, son.  Yes, sir. 
[01:31:30]  So how is the basic training coming along, Private Ryan?  Sir, it's very hard, but I'm giving it my all, sir.  Well, it looks like to me like something else is pretty hard on you, son.  This movie is so hot, I have to tell you.  But you know what?  My problem is I just wish it was more realistic.  Now, if they film my life for a porn movie, that would be realistic.  It could be called Manhattan Manhandles Marco. 
[01:32:00]  Now, for your enjoyment...  No!  For your enjoyment, I would like to reenact a critical scene.  From this multi-award-winning film, Manhattan Manhandles Marco.  Scene three.  After Hours.  In the offices of WNEW.  Oh, no!  Walks Marco...  Walks Marco and Rick.  Rick!  Thanks for inviting me to the studio today! 
[01:32:30]  I see the line, Adam!  I see the line!  I see the line!  I see the line! 
[01:33:00]  Rick, thanks for inviting me down to the studio today!  Rick?  Yes, Marco?  Thanks!  No problem, Marco.  Hey, can I get you a drink?  Oh, you mother...  Coffee or tea or something? 
[01:33:30]  Hmm, I don't think that's the line.  Anything else you have to offer?  Coffee, tea, or me?  Oh, Rick!  Oh, Rick!  If I knew you were serious, you'd know what I'd be asking for! 
[01:34:00]  Rick?  Oh, God!  If I knew you were serious, you'd know what I'd be asking for!  Rick?  Rick?  Then let me just show you how serious I am!  Oh, yes! 
[01:34:30]  Rick!  Take it for the team!  Take it for the team!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Get off of Stinky, Marco!  This is the Gay Marco Alternative Lifestyle Radio Show here on WNEW 102.7.  Let's go to the phones and see if any of the callers are sporting wood like I am.  Hi, Tony.  You're on the air with Gay Marco. 
[01:35:00]  Hey, Marco.  Oh, you have a sexy voice.  That last bit just made me feel so gay.  Like, my sphincter is screaming just...  Anyway, the thing I...  Two questions for you.  Mm-hmm.  One is, um, what's the gay society's version of, like, the penis origami?  Like, do you own a snakeskin watch?  No, I don't.  Uh, the only trick I can do with my penis is make it disappear.  Oh, my God.  Goodbye. 
[01:35:30]  Who else do we have on the line here?  Bill?  Hey.  Hey, Bill.  Oh, how gay are you?  I'm gay.  Oh, my God.  You know, hey, O&A, thanks a lot.  I picked today of all day.  All day I've been up, I figured I'd start folding clothes about 15 minutes ago.  I feel real feminine right now.  Bill, are you left-handed or right-handed?  Uh, uh, what do you call that?  By, uh, whatever.  Ambidextrous?  Yeah, you got it.  Oh, good.  Then I can sit on either side of you at the circle.  Hey, there you go.  Hey, not only did you ruin my clothes folding, but you ruined ours. 
[01:36:00]  I came and watched...  Jamie, you're on with gay Marco.  Yeah, dude, man, my junk is crawling back inside.  What is up with you?  And congratulations to Rick on coming out of the closet.  I'm sitting on the side of 25A listening to this, and I can't...  My sphincter is the size of, like, a pin right now.  Good.  I like them tight.  Well, he ain't getting anywhere near mine, bro. 
[01:36:30]  Let me tell you that.  I just got...  Are you really for real?  I mean, O&A, is he really for real?  I'm the real thing.  Oh, my God.  God help us all.  Thank God you can't reproduce and get any more little gay Marcos going around.  I can't believe this.  My call screener spanky.  Just brought this note to me.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it. 
[01:37:00]  I'm so upset.  I was planning on next doing my sports hunk segment, but my special guest star, Derek Jeter.  Well, it seems his manager called and says, Derek is unable to make it because he has to report to Florida for spring training.  Damn.  And I was looking forward to playing, try to get to third base with the shortstop.  So, instead, we'll just have to play, guess what's in my c**t.  Give me a call at 212-757-1027 with your guests.

No problem.  Bye.  Bye-bye. 
[01:41:30]  Speaking of Jay Moore and some fun, you know, it's hard to believe it was a little over a  year ago.  I was in this very studio, and Jay Moore was spanking me and drawing a bullseye on my ass.  Many of you don't realize our breakup occurred a few months after that.  Yes, while he was on the set of that Kevin Spacey film, Jay called me one night and said  that something had come between us, and I'm just wondering if it was someone who was on  that movie set, but I have to say that that person did me a favor, and today, Jay C is 
[01:42:00]  my only true love.  Yes, this is the Gay Marco Show on 102.7 WNEW, and actually, I wrote a little column this week  about Valentine's Day, so be sure to check that out on Foundry Music, but I personally  decided to remain single this Valentine's Day.  You know, swimsuit season's coming.  I didn't need any of that Godiva chocolate, and I spent the day with my friend Steve, and  we went down to the meatpacking district and had dinner at Pestis, and we sucked down  some muscles, and you know, the kind that come in a shell, and had a few Cosmos, and 
[01:42:30]  then we decided to stroll around town, you know, down there, and you know, I didn't realize  this, but that's where all the transvestite hookers are, and I mean, I guess they don't  call it the meatpacking district for nothing, so anyways, there's this really big fag, there's  this big, fat, nasty hooker, and she like looks at us, and she goes, what are you two fags  looking at, and I'm like, well, we're not looking at you, you nasty old drag hag, and 
[01:43:00]  so then we went running down the street like two little schoolgirls, so this morning, I'm  lying in bed, thinking about this, and I'm like, I can't believe she called us fags, I  mean, that's like the least offensive name to be called, and are there really any names  out there that would truly offend me, and suddenly, it hit me on the right cheek, I  still can't believe I can shoot that far, but so I was cleaning up, while I was cleaning  up, I had this brilliant idea for a new game, the most offensive name game, I want your most 
[01:43:30]  offensive names, besides fag, alright, I want to hear some really offensive names, so if  you really, really offend me, I'll send you one of my autographed pictures of me and Jay  Moore having sex, and now, let me tell you something, before I explain this, there are  some names that just don't offend me, okay, for example, Bone Smuggler, alright, I like  that name, it makes me feel like a sexy pirate, smuggling bones up my butt across the border,  and Sea Sucker, I mean, that one, that one just makes my mouth water, you know, I want really, 
[01:44:00]  really offensive names, so I'm Gay Marco, this is my alternative lifestyle radio show, are  we ready to play here, then why don't we all sing the theme song together, fag, twinkie,  faggala, fairy boy, butt wrangler, the most offensive name game, hey, Alan, yes, how are you  today, Marco, we're playing the most offensive name game, I got one for you, okay, colon cowboy,

Hey, County Police and Fire, where's your emergency?  We have a problem here, I'm trying to get a girl to go to rehab, been doing drugs with Pedro Guerrero.  Is anybody there to be a rescue?  We've been doing drugs for two days with Pedro Guerrero, who just got arrested.  Okay.  It's like cocaine, and I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now. 
[01:52:00]  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  No, no, no.  Come on, do anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does the girl be in the rescue?  No.  That's my favorite.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not this time.  Not this time.  She had to ask if anyone was getting hit or hurt or if he has weapons.  Does the woman have another mouth under her mouth now that's really bloody?  No, not this time.  I've got to hear that again. 
[01:52:30]  That's it.  Okay.  And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  No, no.  I'm like, no, no.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does the girl be in the rescue?  No, she doesn't need a riddle.  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now, don't get started on that again.  No, no.  No weapons.  That's in the golf bag.  I mean, I don't know where the knife is.  That's in a lake in Chicago.  Don't make me get on a plane. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, I cut my knuckle on the nine when I was dialing 911.  That's where the blood's from.  I swear.  Where's Robert Kardashian?  Help me, please.  It's like, no.  What at all?  No, no, no.  Don't think that.  No, no.  Someone hurt.  Need a rescue?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I love.  Don't make me get a Bronco.  Now, what is he doing?  Does he call 911 back?  Oh, no.  911 calls his home, I believe.  I guess they were disconnected or something. 
[01:53:30]  And then 911 usually calls back.  Okay.  So here's the second hand.  Hello, O.J. House.  Oh, wait.  Hang out.  I want you to call the police.  Hello?  Okay.  This is the deuce.  Now, what happened?  I don't know.  You hear O.J. going, I want you to call the police.  I had to hit her over the head with the phone receiver.  We were disconnected.  I like him.  Hello? 
[01:54:00]  This is the police department.  No, she left.  And I don't know what to do about it.  Man, she's frustrated.  This guy, Pedro Guerrero, got arrested for having 15 keys of cocaine.  This girl has spent the last two days doing drugs with him.  Me and her friend just came over to say, you're going into a rehab.  She's got mad.  She just got her car.  She drives a Mercedes.  She lives in the car seats.  Now she is loaded out of her mind.  Get her a Mustang driving around town somewhere. 
[01:54:30]  What other door is driving a license number, but you need to be stopped.  What other is a Mustang?  It's white.  Like a Bronco.  Is she black and white?  She's a white girl.  Okay, thank you.  I got to go and see if I can find her.  Okay.  That's all I need, a white girl.  This has got to be a comedy routine.  I believe Al Cowling's driving.  O.J. calls 911.  Is O.J. putting out a prank call tape?  Is that what's going on here?  The best of O.J.  I call 911 around the country. 
[01:55:00]  Get my 911 comedy tape.  O.J. calls 911.  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator running there?  Yes, it is.  Well, you better catch it.  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello, do you have Prince Albert in a can?  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Yes, we do. 
[01:55:30]  Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.  That's the O.J. Simpson 911 comedy tape.  All of yours now.  He's a big old man.  Hello, is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have 10-pound balls?  Yes, we do.  How do you walk? 
[01:56:00]  You skipped a bunch of O.J. Simpson.  I got to go now.  I got to find her.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh?  Oh, man.  I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug.  I'll try to call it.  Hello, 911?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike. 
[01:56:30]  Enough along with your favorite murderer, O.J.  Number one?  Yes?  Uh, butt plug.  Bug box?  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother.  Does O.J. do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape? 
[01:57:00]  Kind of like the jerky voices?  I'll come down there with my toolbox.  I'll bash your head in with a ratchet.  Or a knife.  I'm O.J.  Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I'd better fly to Chicago.  Oh, man. 
[01:57:30]  That's the O.J. Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now.  Friggin' O.J., man.  He's back.  I love him.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Psycho.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mindful?  No!  It's our show!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a stalk-raving mad person. 
[01:58:00]  No!  I'm getting hit!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No!  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?  What up, yo?  The only morning show covering New York sports with a psychotic passion.  What?  Sports Guys.  1027 WNEW.  Well, what's up, Anthony? 
[01:58:30]  Hey, man.  It's the O.A. show.  Yes, it is.  It's a great day, Anthony.  Beautiful day.  Let's just run down the top ten sports films of all time.  According to USA.  Tenth place, Raging Bull.  Ninth place, Anthony, Slapshot.  That should have been higher on the list.  Raging Bull should have been higher on the list, I think.  Eighth place, Chariots of Fire.  Seventh place, Caddyshack.  Top ten sports films of all time, according to USA. 
[01:59:00]  Number six, Brian's Song.  Who could sit through that?  Number five, Bull Dorm.  Number four, Rocky.  I thought Rocky should be number one.  Hey, Adrian, I got a glass table.  Why don't you squat over it and take a dump?  I'll be underneath it, and you can grab on me.  Mickey, grab on me, Mickey!  Wasn't that written somewhere in some whore's book? 
[01:59:30]  We interviewed the whore's from that book, and they claim, according to their book,  that Rocky was into watching girls crap on a glass table while he was under it.  Well, you know what's better than maybe laying underneath the table, you know?  And, like, watching this s***er open up and just dump it out of me.  Oh, my God, I'm on your face!  Out of my face, Mickey!  Come on, baby.  Why don't you, you know, open it up and give me one over the glass table. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, yeah, man.  That's how I like it.  Sloppy.  I didn't start this!  You started this!  Yeah, give me some.  Oh, look at that.  There's some corn in there.  What's that I see?  Oh, look, I see some peanuts.  Mickey!  She ate peanuts, Mickey! 
[02:00:30]  You know, a girl squats over the table like that.  You're hoping, you know, it's a nice sloppy dump.  You know, you don't want anything.  That's a good one.  Yeah, baby.  All right.  Oh, that's the little driver.  All right. 
[02:01:00]  You know, I don't know where Adrian went.  Adrian must have left the building.  But, hey, Paulie.  Paulie, get over here and squat on the table, Paulie.  Paulie, squad on the table!  Oh, Paulie!  Give it to me, Paulie!  Oh, Paulie!  Big fat ass, Paulie!  Ah, ah! 
[02:01:30]  Hey, Paulie, where's you going?  Now who's gonna squad over the table?  Hell yeah.  Hey, Mickey!  Hey, Mickey, come on over here.  Squad on the table, Mickey.  Oh, Mickey!  Oh, no, look, it's first blood!  Mickey, you two first blood!  Not me!  I didn't start this!  You started!  Ah!  Ah!  Mickey!  Mickey, grab on the table, Mickey! 
[02:02:00]  Ah!  Rocky's a little crab, now!  Oh, great.  Okay, where's my check?  Oh, whatever.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[02:02:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, okay.  Terrific.  Okay. 
[02:03:00]  Hey!  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Okay, horrific.  That's just disgusting.  That's what they said.  Well, according to that book, yeah.  The book that the whore wrote that Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, actually enjoys that.  Squatting him to the table.  We have a brand new glass table here in front of the lesbian couch at NEW.  How long do you think it's going to take before we have that little happening? 
[02:03:30]  We promise before we get fired that we'll make that happen.  Someone's doing a Cleveland steamer on the glass table.  I love it.  Come on, squatting him to the table.  What did you eat, some bran or something?  What did you eat?  Come on, baby.  I just want you, I'm going to hold you hostage for a week straight.  And I want you to eat nothing but prunes and baby food before you get over here. 
[02:04:00]  You whore!  Come on, you whore!  You whore!  I just tried this!  You whore!  Yeah, yeah!  So cute!  What up, man?  You never know where this cluster F is going at any given moment, do we? 
[02:04:30]  Remember, kids, fart equals funny.  Okay, where were we?  Oh, we were at number four.  This has been such a mess of a radio show today, man.  Why not? I'm having fun.  Yeah, what the hell.  We don't care.  So I guess we're at the top five.  Top five sports films of all time, according to USA.  Well, I said five Bull Dorm. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, but that was about 20 minutes ago.  All right, it was Bull Dorm in fifth place.  Fourth place, Rocky.  Third place, The Natural.  Give it to me.  Third place, The Natural.  The Natural Movement.  I like it natural.  Adrian always does it natural.  She don't need no cow pactyl or none of that stuff.  It just comes out.  I think it's her diet.  Yeah!  Okay. 
[02:05:30]  Virgin.  Okay.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, okay, terrific to you too.  All right, in second place, Field of Dreams.  Yeah.  And first place, top sports film of all time, according to USA.  Hoosiers.  Hoosiers.  Yeah, believe it or not, we're in our 30s. 
[02:06:00]  You got that right.  Yeah, I'm about to look forward to.  All the guys I went to high school with, they got real jobs.  They have to wear suits every day, and we make fart jokes every day.  John, what's going on?  Hey, I just basically crapped myself in the car with that Rocky episode.  Unbelievable.  I've never, oh, I just, you guys are stooped to an all-time high.  A high.  An all-time high.  That was just great.  Okay. 
[02:06:30]  All right, just want to say you guys suck.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you, John.  All right, bye.  All right, I guess, John enjoyed that, so.  Oh, do I need a drink?  Yeah, let's take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  We have no clue what we're doing next, but if you want to stick around, by all means do so, okay?  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  But right now, Anthony, we got a little intermission. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, this girl is so freaking hot, too, man.  She was at our impromptu little road show we did at LaBarbat about a month ago. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  And she has volunteered to allow us to drip hot wax all over her smoking body.  Hot wax.  Her smoking body.  What's her name, Rick?  Jill?  Okay.  I remember.  I don't know what her name is, but I remember her face.  Jill.  Bring her in.  You'll remember, Jill.  She showed everyone her ass.  Oh, really?  LaBarbat, and it was a lovely, look at this thing.  Oh, yes, I remember.  How are you doing?  Great to see you again, Jill.  Well, Jill is beautiful.  What nationality are you? 
[02:08:00]  Italian.  Yeah.  She's Italian.  Yeah, 100%, it looks like.  So, have you had wax dripped all over your body before?  No, I've never had.  Really?  No?  I'm a virgin.  You're a wax virgin?  Yeah, we're a virgin.  There's some really hot MTV video.  I don't even know the song, don't know the band, but there was a scene where the guy's  just dripping hot wax all over the girl, and it's not the Ricky Martin video, because there  was some of that going on in La Vida Loca.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever that stupid song was.  This one was a much hotter scene than we saw yesterday. 
[02:08:30]  There's a whole trick to it, you know.  You don't get too close with the wax.  Right.  Have you had it done?  So it's not hot.  No, I've just seen it in porno.  Have you had it done?  I've had it done, yeah.  Oh, you have over?  Yeah, you've got to make sure you drip the wax from high above.  Yeah, that would mean a little higher up.  A little too close.  A little too close.  Ouch.  Ouch. 
[02:09:00]  Ouch.  All right, Jill, now where would you like the wax dripped?  Should we start with the stomach, maybe?  And work our way up, kind of?  Well, Ann, I think we're ready.  Yeah, I think so.  All right, where's the candles?  Candles from the wonderful Yank Me Candle Company.  All right, we're going to start with the stomach, you said?  Sure.  The stomach?  You've got to lose the shirt, then.  You've got to lose the shirt.  Come on.  All right, well, let's start with the stomach.  What do you mean? 
[02:09:30]  All right, on the counter how?  On the counter.  Yeah, you could lay right out there.  Just don't hit any of those vital cough buttons.  Hey, let's move over to these mics.  All right.  Foot, if you would take my mic.  There we go.  Oh, that light's kind of light.  Wow.  Yeah, that's the interrogation mic.  Look at this.  She's, wow.  She's, wow.  She's, uh, I can't really hear myself.  She's lounged out.  What are you doing there, Rick?  All right.  She said no pics.  She agreed without her face.  There are no tapes. 
[02:10:00]  I swear.  There are no tapes.  Where's Liddy?  Maybe he can plant a camera.  She's in a really hot position right now.  Yeah.  We're way above her.  Her stomach is, uh, your stomach is perfect.  What size boobs you got there?  Um, I guess 34B.  34B.  34B.  They're nice.  Very nice.  Okay, we're lighting the candles, Anthony.  All right.  Let's get this lit.  Make sure you, uh, scream right into the mic.  Oh, she's undoing her pants, Anthony.  Yeah.  You don't want any wax to get on those really nice pants. 
[02:10:30]  Wouldn't it be a shame if that nice bra got, uh, lads in it?  Oh, look at these panties that we're about to see.  Yeah.  Don't be shy.  What are those, uh, oh, yeah, little, uh, leopard, leopard print.  Those are like, uh, Victoria's Secrets, right?  Very good.  I know more panties.  You're going to have to edge toward Opie a little more because I'm not going to be able  to hold the candle high enough with the, uh, top of the, uh, thingy here.  Here, pull her pants down.  Pull her.  Pull her pants down.  Oh, okay, boss.  You just can't wait, can you?  Well, I don't want to.  You have really nice pants on, and I don't want to get the wax all over your pants. 
[02:11:00]  It'll be okay for now.  Thanks for your concern.  Okay.  All right, Ann, you want to start?  Yeah, I'll start.  You're a little closer to the stomach area.  You better get up high, though.  I'll start up high.  I will.  Tell me if it hurts.  What are you aiming for?  Ow!  A fire.  Does that hurt?  That burns a little.  Yeah, it will.  It's hot wax.  Yeah.  All right, let me do a couple.  Where are those lead soldiers?  Let's melt a few of those down.  All right, wait, move closer to the edge, though, so I can get the candle higher.  You actually have to move up your head toward Opie a little more.  We get paid to do this stuff? 
[02:11:30]  No.  Just kind of wrap around the counter a little.  All right, I'm going to...  Oh, you've got to go.  I'm aiming right for the belly button.  Yeah, you are.  Oh!  Oh!  That had to hurt.  Oh, I'll go higher.  How's that?  It feels good.  Oh, my God.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  Hey, I'm not stopping.  It's like Asian torture.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right, she's squirming.  Wait, there's too much green wax on the red wax guy.  Hey, go higher.  Higher.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  Oh, my God, you're going to cook the porter.  Is there a stool or something you stand up? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm not going to get this stuff off.  Look at her.  Look at her.  She's, like, squirming.  Wow, this is great.  All right, roll over.  Let's do your ass.  Huh?  Didn't you say you wrote your name on somebody once?  Yeah, I wrote, yeah.  How did we do that with wax?  How did we do that?  Well, this girl was dead.  She was a corpse, so she really didn't move that much.  Oh, wait.  Oh, now we got a pedestal.  I wish Martha Stewart would do something like this with Kansas.  Take out my headphones.  What a great way to spend the holidays, dripping hot wax on people. 
[02:12:30]  I'm going high.  Are we going for the butt now?  Peel some off.  See what it looks like under that.  Hey, Opie.  Be careful.  It's going to fall and shove the candle somewhere.  All right, I'm way higher.  Ow.  By the way, I just got some on my finger and it hurts.  From about an inch away.  Ow, ow, ow.  What body part are we going for now?  Uh, the ass.  Well, we got to lose.  She's got to lose the pants.  Yeah, lose the pants.  Okay.  I'll lose them.  Can I just, like, choose them?  Oh, you can keep trace of them, but.  Lose them all the way.  Can I just take them down?  No, you can pull them down.  Yeah, that's fine. 
[02:13:00]  And then we'll make you walk.  Then we'll make you walk around.  Hey, she just hit Rick.  Cool.  Wow.  She's got a thong on.  That's pretty nice.  All right, she's turning over.  She's got a perfect, perfect ass.  Look at that ass.  Whoa.  We are.  We are.  All right, Rick's getting a picture for, of course, the unofficial website.  That could be the best ass we've ever had in the studio, Anthony.  Bravo.  Turn to the mic because we want our listeners to hear this.  Ow, ow, ow, ow. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, just like that.  That hurts.  All right, I'm sorry.  A little higher.  A little higher, maybe?  Okay.  Wow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Other cheek.  Wow, it's squirming around like crazy.  Oh, she's losing it.  Okay.  She's losing it.  How cool is that, man?  Is there a home version of this game?  Jill, how's it feeling?  Did you think it would sting that much? 
[02:14:00]  No.  Are you liking it?  That was there.  That was there.  Anthony just threw a lit match at her.  Wait, I want one more.  I'm going way up high here.  Move your butt to the edge.  Yes.  All right, here we go.  I'm going for the right cheek.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It almost tickles.  It almost tickles.  It hurts, but it tickles.  Ow.  Oh, my God.  Look at that one.  Isn't that funny?  It looks like some wacky kind of alien creature's ass. 
[02:14:30]  It's got the green and red dot com.  It kind of looks like a disease.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Okay, now we're going to put some black in the universe.  Is that okay?  All right.  Are you taking a picture of the waxed ass?  No, get the other angle, man.  Oh, Anthony, quit.  Oh, my God.  That was like a whole cup full.  All right.  Very good.  It's not going to really build up in here.  Now, Jill, is it erotic at all or no? 
[02:15:00]  It could be.  It could be?  Okay, how about boobage?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, boobage.  We'll go from way high up.  We'll go way high.  It'll be completely dry by the time.  Actually, you can get on the floor.  It won't feel anything like this.  Get on the floor.  All right, she's going after Ed.  Come here.  Give me your ass.  No.  Give me your ass.  No.  Ed's not going to show his ass.  I know.  No.  Ed's not going to show his ass.  No.  Do it on my hand.  We'll let you do spaz. 
[02:15:30]  I'm not going to do it on your ass.  Come on.  Do it on your ass.  No way.  Pull down your pants.  I'm not pulling down my pants.  Jill, it's not happening.  Jill, get on the floor.  Jill, because I'm way up high here.  Someone light my candle fast.  Light man, thank you.  Ann, get up.  Get way up here.  Are we going for the boobs from 20 feet up?  Yeah.  Ann, now Jill's on the floor.  We're about 15 feet up in the air.  Are we going to...  We're aiming for the boobs, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, how do people leave the studio if you feel uncomfortable? 
[02:16:00]  I'll take off my bra.  Oh, she's going to take off her bra.  Don't hit her face.  Oh, my God.  All right, cover her face, because this could be a problem.  Hold on.  Put a paper bag on her head.  No offense, because you do have a very nice face, but get a paper bag for her head.  No, that ain't going to work.  Get a paper bag.  I'm serious.  A paper bag for her head.  She'll be the unknown lesbian.  All right, Jill.  Wow, this is a very nice position you got there. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, she could do that.  You don't want to get any on that bra, though.  No, it's all right.  No, we need the bra off.  Yeah, we do.  Yeah.  If you cover your face, you'll be fine.  You have nothing to hide.  Trust me.  All right, Ann.  I feel special.  She'll take her bra off for us.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, here comes the bra.  Oh, wow.  Hey, nice.  There we go.  That is some fine ta-tas.  Okay.  Wait, move the bra, because I'm going to...  Yeah.  Dude, you sure you don't want to give her, like, a bag or something for her head? 
[02:17:00]  Oh, God.  Hold it close, because there might be splatter.  Yeah.  Like, hold it under your chin, kind of.  All right.  Yeah, there you go.  Ready?  I'm way above it.  Here it comes.  I'm way above.  A little higher.  Oh, stay away from the head.  Oh, my God.  That would have hit her right in the face.  All right, she's squeezing her boobs together because of the pain.  I'm going to try for the nip.  Okay.  I'm going for the nip.  Oh, my God.  Pilot, ta-bam, my dear.  It hurts.  It hurts.  All right.  All right.  Back off.  All right.  Back off for a second.  Let's see who got closer.  I got closer to the bullseye.  You did?  Yeah, you have the right boob. 
[02:17:30]  I have the left one, and my wax got closer.  I wish I could say what that looks like right now.  That's pretty good.  That is pretty good.  You've done this before.  It's like a Norton bombsite.  The Enola game.  I was off the tarmac.  All right.  One more.  Like Bozo the Clown.  One more splatter.  Okay.  One more pass, and we'll be done.  Here we go.  Ready?  From above.  Oh.  Oh.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Oh, I almost got.  Oh, bullseye.  Oh, you got it.  Oh, yeah.  I feel it.  Anthony wins.  Somebody got bullseye.  She is shaking. 
[02:18:00]  Anthony wins.  Anthony wins.  I think she has a wood floor.  Really?  Yeah, look.  Look what?  You need that waxed?  Well, Jill, how did that feel?  Um, not bad.  Yeah?  Pretty good.  It's pretty good.  Pretty good.  More ass guys?  Yeah, turn over on your butt.  Rick the ass.  Rick.  More ass.  Rick can get a job of boobs with the wax all over them?  Okay.  All right, turn over.  You know what?  Let me get one more.  It's like stiff.  Yes. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, it is.  Yes.  Oh, I thought you were talking about our pants.  No, of course she's talking about the wax all over her chest, Anthony.  Okay.  Looks like she has the measles.  Mercy.  Oh, my God.  It feels really weird.  Yeah, it does feel weird.  All right.  All right.  We're going for the plot.  Back to the ass.  Okay.  Ow.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  She's cursed. 
[02:19:00]  She's cursed.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  She's driving on us.  She's in pain.  She's had it.  She's had enough.  She's had enough.  She's tapped out.  She tapped out.  One, two, three.  She's out.  Wow.  May I kind of burn?  You think?  Jill, talk into the mic.  How does that feel?  Well, not bad.  It feels okay.  All right.  Peel one off.  Let me see what it looks like underneath.  Peel off a little thing. 
[02:19:30]  That one's going to burn out.  Is it red?  No.  No.  No, she's fine.  Oh, you take it like a champ.  Yes, I do.  Those are only third degree burns.  Cool.  The hospital's really close to you.  Napalm.  All right.  That was like the best thing I've ever done.  Snake and nate that ass.  All right, Ann.  Wow.  That rocked.  That was pretty cool.  That was real cool.  Psycho Mark's coming in with his own candle that he wants to drip on. 
[02:20:00]  Put that away, Mark.  He's got a little wick anyway.  All right.  Jill's getting her clothes back on.  The phone's just going nuts here, Anthony, as you would expect.  Jack, what's up?  I can't walk.  Jack.  Hello?  Hey, what's up?  Wow, look at all the wax.  Jeff, not Jack.  Oh, sorry, Jeff.  What's up?  You guys are killing me.  You obviously have a girl that was very sensitive, delicate skin.  Now that you've dripped hot wax on her, can't you at least soothe her with a tongue bath  or some ice cubes?  Would you like some ice cubes, Jill?  Actually, I might.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:20:30]  Look at him.  Look at him, Mark.  Rick, run, run like the wind, Rick.  Four guys just saw it.  Oh, there you go.  A couple of icy cold Budweiser's.  Buds.  We're not drinking them.  They just happen to be in the area, and they're ice cold.  Oh, there you go.  They're icing.  I don't have a boyfriend, so what is it?  Oh, my God.  He's a friend.  He's a friend.  Yeah, the guy that walked in all of a sudden now is like, get out.  All right.  They're icing down the area.  They're icing down her butt with a couple of cold Buds. 
[02:21:00]  Yes.  Don't you guys owe it to her to at least be the ones to ice her down?  You did inflict the pain.  I do want to go home tonight, sir.  Don't you have an almost divorcee in that studio with you?  I am impending litigation, sir.  I can't use this.  This can be used against me.  Put a paper bag on your head.  Thank you, buddy.  Wow, Greg checking in.  Not funny.  14 years old.  You guys make puberty fun. 
[02:21:30]  Glad we can help.  Yeah, we didn't have this when we were growing up.  Hey, they're going to get it somewhere, and we might as well supply the info.  I learned it from you, okay?  All right, we've got to thank Jill for stopping on by the show.  That rocked.  Thank you.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Yes.  It's already mowed.  Believe me.  Well, there's radio.  There's edgy.  There's psychotic.  And then there's ONA.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power. 
[02:22:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  Uh, Dre from the city.  Did you guys watch the NRA meeting last weekend?  Yeah.  Charlton Heston spoke, and it was like a scene from Planet of the Apes.  He was holding a big rifle and yelling.  What do you think I've ever seen?  You know something?  I am a very strong advocate to the right to bear arms. 
[02:22:30]  I really am.  I'm serious.  But that Charlton Heston is an effing lunatic.  He's out of his mind.  That guy is crazy.  Looking more and more like an ape every day.  Oh, yeah.  He's starting to look exactly like Dr. Zayas.  Yeah.  He's getting the big protruding jaw.  Dr. Zayas.  Help me.  Zayas.  Zayas.  Zayas.  Zayas.  Help me.  Yeah.  We got him. 
[02:23:00]  He looks just like him.  Damn you.  He did that famous line.  Take it out of my gun when they pry my cold dead fingers from around it.  Damn you all to hell!  And he had the rifle up in the air.  He was holding it like Moses held the staff.  Yeah.  And he's like holding it.  Damn you!  I was expecting him to fire a few rounds off into the ceiling.  Damn you all to hell!  Yeah.  Anti-gun people! 
[02:23:30]  F off!  I treat you like I treated those gorillas on Planet of the Apes with my gun!  Remember that?  I shot them all, bastards.  Then I fooled Dr. Zayas to come around the corner and I put the gun to his head.  That red monkey ass is.  I believe it is the right of every American to have a Vulcan cannon in his car if he wants one. 
[02:24:00]  Damn you!  And what's the problem?  Why?  Why a problem with the theme restaurant in Times Square?  We want an NRA theme restaurant along with Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock and the Sports Cafe!  Hey!  Mr. Heston, that's a little wacky.  Why damn you!  It's an NRA theme restaurant in Times Square.  Why?  What's the difference?  It's a hobby.  A sport like everyone else. 
[02:24:30]  Why can't you have goddamn hippie communist clothes hanging up in the Hard Rock?  But you can't have good old American guns in a restaurant.  That's what a restaurant needs!  Come on!  We could serve the children little, like, sundaes after they eat.  Ice cream sundaes with, like, magnum rounds decorating you.  That'd be cute.  You'd take them home.  Little guns hanging up all over the place. 
[02:25:00]  They're out of their mind, though.  An NRA theme restaurant.  Because we were at the All-Star Cafe.  Yes.  And we ordered the Shack Attack turkey sandwich.  Shack Attack turkey sandwich.  Or whatever it was.  Why have that when you can have Ruby Ridge ribs?  Come on, damn you!  How about the Columbine Cobbler Salad?  Yes!  It's on the menu!  Or if you're watching the game.  Yeah.  What would be better than sitting down with some wacky Waco wings? 
[02:25:30]  Hot wings!  Come on, damn you!  Mr. Heston, don't forget about the Luima lasagna.  Yes!  That'd be great!  All the waitstaff will have guns.  So if anyone tries to walk out on the check, we shoot them!  Could you imagine that?  The Kent State College crunchy chicken fingers.  There's just a few things on the menu. 
[02:26:00]  Damn you!  I'll treat you like that red-ass, mandrin-monkey-ass, gorilla-ass that was trying to get me on Planet of the Apes.  Can I say yes one more time?  Charlton Heston, will you be like a hostess at the restaurant?  I'll be the hostess.  I'll be the hostess.  Yeah.  And fully armed.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  When you order a steak, you go in the back and shoot at yourself! 
[02:26:30]  Come on!  I'll give you a 30-odd six and you'll just pluck it off!  Bash that dumb cow over the head!  We'll hold his feet.  We'll head him and heel him with the rope.  You take out the .357 right between the horns!  And then, oh, it's so tender and juicy that way.  Would you like it well done or rare so it's red like Zira's monkey-ass? 
[02:27:00]  Some days I'll be dressed in a loincloth.  Oh, yuck.  Some days in a loincloth.  Some days in my outfit I had in the Omega Man.  Right.  Remember that movie?  Sure do.  What did I have in the Omega Man?  Guns and plenty of them to shoot the dead.  What happens if we're overrun with the living dead and we don't have guns to defend ourselves?  What happens if we don't have guns in this country and all of a sudden guerrillas take over? 
[02:27:30]  Would you like to be like those mindless people held in cages being dissected?  Or would you like to be like Chuck Heston when I see the Statue of Liberty and I fight back with my gun?  Damn you!  You blew it up!  Remember?  Every Chuck Heston movie you see where I have a gun, I come out on top! 
[02:28:00]  Although I died in Planet of the Apes, I died in the Omega Man.  Oh.  I died in Soylent Green.  Wait a minute.  Hold it.  That didn't work out too well.  I didn't have a gun in Ten Commandments and I lived.  I didn't have a gun in Ben Hearn.  I made it through that.  I died in the Omega Man.  Goddamn guns are screwing me up!  I die in all my gun movies!  Anthony or Mr. Heston, whoever you are right now.  Yes, damn you.  More and more suggestions for the NRA-themed restaurant menu coming in. 
[02:28:30]  Yes.  Let's not forget the Son of Sam soup and sandwich special.  That's a good one.  The .44 caliber killer.  David from Ridgewood, New Jersey.  Columbine Calamari on the appetizer.  Columbine Calamari!  Let's not forget Watts Wings.  What about the Jack Ruby Red Wine?  Yes.  You drink that with the Cheese Harvey Oswald.  It's the burger.  Cheese Harvey Oswald!  It's a play on the name, you doppy bastard! 
[02:29:00]  Well, they have a breakfast special too, Anthony.  The Lee Harvey Omelette.  Lee Harvey Omelette.  For breakfast.  Look at the way we break the eggs.  Back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  And then a little, a little, a little, what's her name, Kennedy?  Jackie O.  Jackie O.  Tries to get the shell from the back of the trunk of the car and put it back on the egg.  It's so cute.  Boy, I went a long way for that dopey joke. 
[02:29:30]  Bloodstained tablecloths on every table.  Moses from Egypt checking in.  I'd like to order the 9mm chicken bullets with barbecue sauce up, please.  Oh, tender.  Jim, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, Jim here.  Yeah, what's up?  Hello, Jim.  How about the John Wilkes Booth bacon cheeseburger?  That's a good one.  All right.  A big stack of curly fries.  It'll be good food.  Good food and firearms. 
[02:30:00]  That's what we need in Times Square.  Uh, Mr. Heston, don't forget shooting anymore.  Don't forget about the Diablo poppers.  Get 41 per order.  Damn you.  The Sirhan Sirhanwich.  Come on.  It's a good one.  The JFK Open Face Sandwich.  What's wrong with that?  Holy cow.  Why? 
[02:30:30]  Why are people so adverse to guns?  Guns with your meal.  A little happy meal for children with a little, little 22 Saturday night special.  You can run around and have fun shooting each other.  How about the Sirhan Slurpee?  Yes.  For dessert.  The Grassy Knoll Salad Bar.  The Grassy Knoll Salad Bar.  All part of the NRA-themed restaurant, right? 
[02:31:00]  The Klebold Casserole.  What's the matter?  There's endless possibilities.  Damn you.  Son of sandwich.  Son of ham sandwich.  If the wages is late with your order, not only is it free, but you shoot the bitch.  Nova.

The Jeffrey Dahmer Sampler.  Oh, God.  You can have a cold right out of the fridge.  Well, he didn't use guns, but that's close enough.  Damn you all the hell.  That's sick.  See what I did with that gorilla?  And, uh...  Beneath the Planet of the Apes. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  I shot them all!  Yes, sir.  Guns!  We need more guns in our restaurant.  Damn you!  We're going to have a special lunch, uh, special for postal employees.  Yeah?  That come in.  Yeah, they bring their own guns.  Blow off some steam and some heads.  Bring in a gun, get a free, uh, appetizer?  Oh, man.  The David Koresh Kanish.  For our Hebrew friends. 
[02:32:30]  Salad with Smith and Wesson oil and vinegar.  Damn you!  Oh, yes.  How about...  Red mandrel ass.  How about...  I want my burger raw, like...  Like Zira's ass when I pounded it when Cornelius was away.  He never found out.  How about the Leon...  I love monkey ass!  How about the Leon Klinghoffer cocktail?  Two shots and a splash. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And, uh, you can try the Eric Harris hot potato.  Colin Ferguson curly fries.  Colin Ferguson.  It's cute.  We'll have a little electric train set that'll bring it out for you.  To the sound of gunfire!  And the kids can play in the electric chair.  Yes! 
[02:33:30]  That's right.  Damn you.  You ever pound monkey ass, Opie?  It's almost as good as shooting guns!  Anthony, let's not forget the Dwyer Bud draft.  Yes!  Very good.  That's Chris in line, too.  Thank you, Chris.  You sick F.  The Columbine sloppy Joe, Anthony.  Oh, God damn!

And Paul E. from Lawrence, I assume we'll all be drinking Colt 45s.  Damn you.  The restaurant slogan should, uh, could be eat hot lead. 
[02:34:30]  And instead of a drive-thru, they have a drive-by.  Amy Fisher and chips.  That's great for you English blokes that are too faggy to have guns in your country.  Stupid bobbies with their, their sticks.  One gun and they take over the whole country.  Um, Mr. Heston Berger from New Rochelle.  Yes.  The University of Texas Clock Tower Tea.  That's a good one.  The Martin Luther King Size Sandwich. 
[02:35:00]  What's wrong with that?  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I got, uh, two things.  Yeah.  I like to sit in my favorite John Wilkes booth and have my Brady vegetables.  The James Brady.  James Brady mixed vegetables.  Very good.  Yeah, there'll be a booth called the John Wilkes booth.  John Lennon Lemon Chicken. 
[02:35:30]  What's wrong with that?  Hunted yourself.  Catcher in the Rye Fish Fry.  For you Beatle fans.  Shane, what's up?  How about the Bernie Gess Burrito?  Very good.  Yes.  Sorry.  All right, there goes Shane.  Bernie Gess.  Kyle from, uh, Mayo Pack.  Uh, try the Salina Salsa and Chips.  It's great.
