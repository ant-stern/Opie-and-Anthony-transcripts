<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, starting with a discussion of Tom Watson's near-miss at the British Open.  The hosts reacted with a mixture of disappointment and amusement, using vulgar language to describe his final putt and the playoff loss to Stuart Cink.  They analyzed Watson's performance and speculated on the pressures of professional golf. The conversation then shifted to a tribute to the recently deceased Walter Cronkite, where the hosts shared memories and anecdotes about his career, including clips of his reporting and details about his personal life, contrasting his style with modern news media.  This transitioned into a sarcastic and humorous rant about fly fishing, with callers offering explanations met with skepticism and mockery.  One caller's offensive comment about cruising for transvestites elicited a crude response from a host.

The show continued with a debate on whether fishing is a sport, fueled by caller accounts of their fishing experiences, ranging from unsuccessful fly fishing attempts to marlin and tuna fishing, sparking a lengthy and vulgar discussion about the ethics of fishing. This section contained extensive discussion and audio clips about a show contributor, "Bobo," who had a noticeable erection during a previous show, including attempts to measure it and listener speculation about the cause. Bobo himself called in, discussing his hangover and the events of the previous night.  "Boner testing" for Bobo was scheduled for a future show.

The next segment focused on Bobo's upcoming YouTube series, based on a local character, Tippy Tom. The hosts discussed the planned pilot episode at a restaurant, involving a costume, "liquid ass," and the song "Do You Think I'm Sexy?", raising concerns about the impact on the restaurant. This transitioned into a critical discussion of rival radio personality Man Cow, playing clips to highlight his perceived hypocrisy and failed attempts at rebranding. The hosts also voiced their outrage over their executive producer, Steve Carlisi's, unilateral decision to take every Monday off, criticizing his lack of communication and apparent disregard for the show.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of workplace frustrations and criticism of Chuck Schumer's political actions on gun control, alongside their broader political opinions on Obama's healthcare plan. A surprise in-studio guest, Ace Frehley of Kiss, then joined the show. The conversation shifted to Frehley's career with Kiss, including anecdotes from the "Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park" movie, his solo career, and his relationships with other band members. He also shared a childhood fantasy involving Kiss.  The hosts mentioned other musicians, Jay Oakerson as a potential future guest, and Dr. Aaron Carroll, scheduled for a healthcare debate. A magic trick and further off-color humor concluded this segment.

The final segment centered on Jimmy Norton's birthday, beginning with a debunking of a levitation magic trick.  Ace Frehley remained as a guest. The discussion moved to YouTube videos, including the infamous "Two Girls One Cup" video, with Frehley's reaction noted. Ronnie James Dio called in to wish Norton a happy birthday.  A frustrating experience with a Winnebago commercial shoot was recounted.  Kelly Brook (mistakenly identified initially) made a surprise appearance, leading to awkward interactions and a photo opportunity. Big Jay Oakerson also briefly appeared to promote his work. The segment ended with a birthday cake presentation featuring a crude and graphic design.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Fucking retard.  Yep. Absolutely.  Hi. Can I just tell everybody how depressed I am that Tom Watson fucking blew the British Open?  I know maybe a small percentage of our listeners care about golf, care about Tom Watson.  Actually, I haven't even thought of Tom Watson in probably 20 years. 
[00:00:30]  I didn't even know he was still golfing.  Still golfing. I thought he was on the senior tour.  And then all of a sudden, Tiger Woods doesn't make the cut.  He's knocked out, which was the second time that happened in his career.  He got knocked out of the British Open?  Oh, yeah. Second time he didn't make the cut in a major.  Wow.  And then all of a sudden, there's Tom Watson having a nice first day.  I'm like, Tom Watson? What the fuck is this Tom Watson still playing?  How old is he?  And then I think a lot of people watched golf this weekend because we had a story that was developing. 
[00:01:00]  Travis says one of the greatest sports stories ever.  Yeah.  And that's open for debate, obviously.  But definitely the greatest sports story of the last year to five years, easy.  We almost had a guy that's just about 60.  He's going to be 60 in September when the British Open.  And I was all in, man.  All in.  I woke up early on Saturday just to watch stupid Tom Watson play.  Because the coverage was from like 7 in the morning to 11. 
[00:01:30]  Because they played it all the way over there.  Yeah.  Where everything is green because, you know, the sun never comes out.  It's just a marsh.  How cold does the water look on TV even?  That's when you know the water is cold.  Where you have no question in your mind.  You're like, that water is fucking cold.  Yep.  And you're watching it on TV.  So yesterday, I was out in Huntington over the weekend.  So I was in a hotel room.  And I'm getting a late checkout and all this stuff.  It's a beautiful day out.  And I'm glued to the TV because of this Tom Watson.  You're wasting a beautiful day. 
[00:02:00]  And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, I tweet, oh, my God.  Tom Watson could win the British Open at 59 years old.  Of course, that was the tweet of death.  Once again, me and my stupid sports curse.  What's the oldest that anybody ever wanted?  43, I think.  I think the oldest guy to win a major was 43 years old.  So Tom Watson, 16 years past that.  He looks real old.  The back of his neck from all that sun.  Did you see the back of his neck?  A leather strap on the back of his neck.  Pretty much. 
[00:02:30]  It was just leather.  And so then he's on the 18th hole.  He's up by one.  He's in the fairway.  Everyone's like, holy shit, this is going to happen.  Yeah.  And he hits his iron, a pretty good iron shot.  But it's off the green, kind of up against the rough, right?  And he walks up to the 18th green.  And the place is losing their minds.  They're like, we are seeing something that you're just never going to see again.  Almost a 60-year-old winning the British Open.  So then he pulls out his putter, when he probably should have chipped it, but whatever. 
[00:03:00]  Now we're getting a little too technical here.  And he hits his putt, even though he's off the green, 10 feet past.  And right there I go, holy shit, this guy's not winning the British Open.  I just knew he wasn't.  Yeah.  But then the announcer getting so excited, he's like, he's made a million of these putts.  It's going to happen.  And if you haven't seen it yet, the fucking putt he missed on 18, it wasn't even close  to giving himself a shot.  It looked like any amateur just playing a game with his friends trying to make that putt. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  It was that bad.  Now you're realizing, oh my God, I'm really nervous.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, the pressure just got to him.  Yeah.  The putt was probably one of the lamest putts I've ever seen on TV.  Lame.  Can we see it, Dan?  Do we have it?  Not only was he short, it was to the right.  I mean, as soon as he hit it, he started walking.  He knew, oh my God, I just blew this.  I fucked it up.  Wait, now is he, I don't watch golf at all, but I noticed a lot of these guys choke under 
[00:04:00]  pressure.  A lot of these guys do.  Guys like Tiger Woods don't choke.  It makes you hate golfers because it's like fucking relief pitchers go in and win World  Series striking guys out.  Yeah.  Well, it was a huge choke and it was, I don't even know why, but I was so damn depressed.  And I don't give a shit about Tom Watson.  Travis, when you're depressed.  You had time invested.  You're depressed because this would have been such a good story that you want it to happen. 
[00:04:30]  It was just one of those stories.  It doesn't happen.  This will, this probably will not happen again.  Of course.  There's a reason it doesn't happen, you know?  So then he, he is now tied.  So now he's got to go into a four hole playoff.  British Open is a four hole playoff.  Most golf tournaments, it's sudden death.  Tom Watson would have had a much better chance at a sudden death playoff, even though he would  have lost anyway, because sink, whatever, whatever.  Getting too technical.  Sink's 36.  Watson's 59.  He sort of fell apart in the 18th hole.  Now it's a four hole playoff. 
[00:05:00]  I'm like, this is so fucking over.  Who did he lose to?  BJ, uh, is the guy's name?  CJ Sink.  Oh, CJ Sink.  Uh, Stuart Sink.  I'm sorry.  It's still early.  Stuart Sink.  Oh, is this the putt?  Watch this putt, Jimmy.  How the fuck did he miss it from there?  It's windy, though.  It is windy.  Look at the wind.  And Watson is known to just make these all day long.  And watch.  It's not even like he doesn't even give it a chance.  That's all he had.  And now he's like, oh, jeez.  Did he know he just blew it? 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And he probably knew that was it for me.  Because Sink's a younger guy.  And now, you know, four hole playoff.  Stuart Sink just destroyed him in the playoff.  Did he?  Destroyed him.  He hit two 60-foot putts on Friday.  And he couldn't hit that.  Yeah.  60.  How many feet was that?  Like 10, they're saying.  Yeah, I think it was 10 or 12.  What a prick.  Anyone should be able to make that.  Not even.  It was less than 10, possibly.  Any pro playing this game should be able to make that.  Honestly, if he had, like, if he had that putt five more times, he would have made every  one of them. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  He really would have.  What do you need to practice it if you're going to miss that one?  Yeah, exactly.  Save all those hours.  Dummy.  Just miss.  I could do that.  He's a really good putter.  Like, he's, whatever.  And then I'm like, why am I depressed?  I'm so bummed out.  And then when the playoff started and he lost the first hole, I turned off the TV.  I just knew.  Yeah.  I went outside and enjoyed the fine day we had in the New York area.  Wait, after you lose the first hole, is it like if you lose the first two, you're done?  No, you have to play all four, and then it's the total score for each golfer. 
[00:06:30]  I mean, each tournament is kind of different.  You know, the U.S. Open, it's an 18-hole playoff.  Which is insane.  That is insane.  An 18-hole playoff?  Yeah, you have to come back the next day and do an 18-hole playoff.  How mad you must be if you blow that one.  British Open, though, it's four.  But it was his.  I mean, he has no one to blame.  It was his to lose, and he lost it.  He was holding back tears at the last hole.  Oh, and his wife.  Tears in his eyes, I guess, as he blows this last shot.  Dude, his wife's on the 18th green. 
[00:07:00]  They're old-timers.  They look like they have no business playing, you know, in the PGA.  Has he won that before?  Yeah, he's won, I think, five times.  Oh, fuck him.  Four or five times.  Fuck him in his ass, though.  Now, how much did he make?  How about this?  You ready for this?  This is how old the fucking guy is.  Guess what year was the last year he won the fucking British Open?  Oh, no.  Just guess.  My one guess will make it seem like it's not impressive.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  The answer is, but the answer is 1983.  All right, that's a long time.  26 years ago.  I wanted to guess 1917. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, something stupid.  So he's won it before.  How much money do you make if you win it or if you come in second like he did?  Did he come in second?  Yeah, but honestly, he doesn't need the money.  It's not the money, right?  Yeah, I mean, you know.  It's the prestige.  And he was basically, like Travis said, holding back tears.  And in the press conference, he said, I'm not going to lie.  I'm depressed.  I'm just depressed.  I'm not going to lie.  I sucked an ass.  He said the dream almost came true.  Like, how depressing is that?  Dude, it was his, though. 
[00:08:00]  Like, he didn't have to do anything spectacular in the 18th hole.  He just had to, you know, do a par.  And during the week, Travis, you knew he went birdie, par, birdie?  Yeah.  Something like that?  Yeah, par, birdie, par.  Par, birdie, par.  And then, you know, the day he needed it, he goes bogey.  I can't tell you.  I was so fucking bummed out.  The fact that I'm actually, this is what's really annoying me.  I'm kind of interested in this.  And it's like, if I start watching, it's the last thing I need to do to start watching golf.  I'm actually like, you're saying, par, birdie, par. 
[00:08:30]  And I'm like, bogey.  Like, I'm getting it now.  And I'm like, why?  I shouldn't know any of that lingo.  You shouldn't get into the PGA because of this.  This was just one of those rare things that, like, even people that weren't into golf started taking a peek.  Like, wait a minute, what?  A 59-year-old guy?  And there's no one even close to that age that was in contention.  Who's the best at handling pressure?  It's got to be Tiger Woods.  Is he the guy that, like, makes that putt almost every time?  It's hard to say.  I mean, you know, a lot of these guys get the yips.  The yips.  I think Greg Norman choked a lot. 
[00:09:00]  Is he the one that chokes?  Greg Norman choked last year in the British Open.  Yeah, he was one that choked.  He had a chance to be, like, the oldest guy to win the British Open last year, and he choked.  But isn't he notorious for choking?  I don't know.  Honestly, I don't know.  That's Phil Mickelson.  Oh, Phil will miss a three-foot putt.  For real.  That's unbelievable.  Terrible, right?  That's why I can't.  That's so.  My father-in-law loves Phil Mickelson, and I love Tiger Woods, so we kind of do a little, you know, we battle it out a little bit.  But I can't like Phil Mickelson because he chokes too much with those three- to four-footers.  Enough of that, I guess. 
[00:09:30]  But it was just so fucking depressing.  Well, he hasn't won it, like, now that I'm doing math, since he was 33 years old.  I mean, he's 59, 83, 93, 103.  Yeah.  That's 26 years ago.  Yeah.  That's a long time.  Yeah.  That's a long fucking time.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  Enough.  I made my point.  But when you start talking about he should have chipped it, then you'll lose me.  I don't understand that.  What does a chip mean?  Craig in New Hampshire.  Craig.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Let me turn them all right on here.  Yeah.  Opie, I'm out on a 36-0 right now, mowing keys and approaches, and I work with a bunch 
[00:10:00]  of old, retired guys, and those guys are freaking crushed this morning, Opie.  Seriously, they've probably spent the whole fucking weekend glued to the television.  I think everyone was pretty much hinting to Stewart Sink, you know, blow this.  Like, you know, I was pissed when he hit that putt on 18, Opie.  I was really pissed at that guy for making that putt at 18, and I know he shouldn't be,  but I was like, no, don't fucking go in, and it did.  I was like, oh, no.  Well, it didn't matter.  He could have five-putted pretty much from that distance and still won. 
[00:10:30]  I mean, he killed him in the playoff.  But I think people were basically telling Stewart, this isn't yours.  Sorry.  You have to step aside and let this happen.  It was one of those things you just have to let happen.  It would have been a class move.  Imagine if he turned around and just hit it back toward the tee.  Smacked it off the green or something.  You know how embarrassing that would have been for that guy, though?  Like, he had, the old guy had it and won and blew it.  Like, when you blow a putt, and I'm not even a fucking golf fan, and I saw it,  and he blew that.  I'm like, what a dope.  That's a big one. 
[00:11:00]  If you blow a 200-foot putt, is there any such thing?  I don't know if there is.  That's great.  I want to know the circumstances where you blow a 200-foot putt.  200 foot.  I guess if it's in, like, a gutter, and you just got to get the ball moving.  Let's say hi to Kellen in England.  Kellen.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  The show is worldwide, of course.  Huh?  I was in a bar watching this yesterday about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, 
[00:11:30]  and people were just fucking swearing at the TV at this old guy losing his game  because everybody here really wanted him to win,  and people were just losing their minds as he progressively got worse  and fucked it up.  They couldn't believe it.  Did he start blowing it as the game went on?  No, that's the thing.  He, like, I mean, he hung in there right to the end,  and he was up by one with one hole to go.  It was a perfect spot to be in.  Oh, he was up by one and blew it.  Okay.  Up by one, one hole to go, an easy, relatively easy hole.  I mean, there was a lot of wind, but everyone else was playing the wind, 
[00:12:00]  and, dude.  And when I tweeted how depressed it was, there was a guy,  if you were watching the coverage, there was a lighthouse.  Of course, it has this, like, you know, this classic lighthouse on it,  and there was a cameraman on the top of the lighthouse.  He fucking tweeted me back.  I'm like, you fucking follow me, and you're behind a camera at the British Open?  And he goes, it's so depressing here, I can't even tell you.  You could just feel it in the air when he started falling apart.  Oh, wow.  It was just one of those things that everyone wanted to happen.  Everyone wanted it to happen, 
[00:12:30]  and then he fucked everybody over by sucking ass.  All right, one more call, we'll move on.  Let's go to Elizabeth.  Elizabeth.  Yeah, hey, boys.  I just wanted to say, I'm a chick, and I'm not really even into golf,  and on one of the only beautiful days we've had in New England this summer,  I was sitting inside watching that game, and I was heartbroken when he lost.  But I did hear them say, apparently, that 10-foot shot is his Achilles,  and he just couldn't pull it off.  Oh, is that the one he blows every time?  Yeah, and they were saying that they should have gone over and psyched him up 
[00:13:00]  and said, you've made this shot a million times,  and just didn't do it and couldn't pull it off.  Maybe he's one of those guys that if you come over and talk to him beforehand,  they probably knew if they talked to him and he'd blow it,  he'd brain them at the club.  Brain.  Fucking out, boys.  Thanks a lot.  It just became one of those things, like people started going,  what, wait, a 59-year-old guy might win this thing?  And they started watching when they would probably not watch golf.  If you're a sports fan, you almost had to watch this, you know? 
[00:13:30]  And if you like a good story, that's what I think a lot of people started watching for.  I can't imagine who was rooting for Stewart Cink for real.  Even I think Stewart Cink fans, because they had to mention that,  he's got a half million followers on Twitter, and Tom Watson does.  Really?  And Tom Watson doesn't even know what the internet is.  All right, we get it.  Tom Watson's a little older.  He's old.  We get it.  But I bet you even Stewart Cink's fans were like,  you know what, let's let Watson win this one,  and we'll start supporting you again next week. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, they had to mention that.  500,000 fans?  Something like that.  400.  That's a pressy that is.  Yeah.  That stupid golfer has.  I've never heard of him.  You've never heard of Stewart Cink?  That's why I said BJ.  Isn't it BJ Singh, a guy?  Oh, Vijay Singh.  Oh, Vijay Singh.  Okay.  Yeah, he used to be something.  He's kind of fading out these days.  Vijay Singh.  I don't know what their names were.  But anyway, and then Walter Cronkite died,  and I certainly wasn't depressed about that.  I mean, you know, I was depressed about Tom Watson  missing a 10-foot putt, but Walter Cronkite passing, whatever. 
[00:14:30]  You know what, though?  Actually, I was kind of sad,  because we grew up watching Walter Cronkite, didn't we?  Pretty much.  Yeah, well, it was a little earlier.  Like our fathers.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  My uncles.  I didn't give a shit about the news that much,  but I remember, you know, Apollo 11  and watching his coverage of that  and stuff like that when I was a kid.  But yeah, that was pretty much, I don't know,  a little before me.  Yeah, it was sad that he died, 
[00:15:00]  but you know what?  It's hard to feel sad when a 92-year-old guy goes.  Unless he's fucked to death by a large animal.  I don't think that happened.  What happened to Walter?  We left him alone with the bull mastiff,  and it just ran in,  and it just wouldn't stop fucking him.  We had to throw water on him.  Then you feel bad.  I have a tough time being sad for people  that pretty much live a perfect life  and die 92, 93, at home with his family around.  Peacefully, yeah.  With his young wife,  who's Carly Simon's older sister.  Did anyone read that over the weekend? 
[00:15:30]  Carly Simon has an older sister who's into opera.  She's an opera singer.  Yeah.  And she was dating Walter Cronkite  the last three or four years of his life.  How about that?  And she's like 68, and he was 93.  Wow.  Look at Walter.  Yeah.  Getting some of that young pussy.  That's a chippy for him.  That's a chippy.  He was a cuckold.  She used to fuck the guy from the Green Mile  in front of him.  Michael Clark Duncan or Duncan Clark,  whatever his name is.  Good for Walter.  But they're like, what? 
[00:16:00]  The news world lost a giant.  Well, we kind of lost him many, many years ago.  A lot of years ago.  Many, many years ago.  He hasn't really...  To hear the hypocritical news  like waxing fantastic over his career  as they have just bastardized it over the years  and rubbed his legacy in shit.  Yeah.  And then they sit there just praising him.  They're the ones that fucked him over.  Fucked over his legacy.  The news is now a joke. 
[00:16:30]  The news is now...  When he was doing the news,  it had credibility.  That guy went out and found the stories  he talked about that night.  He was a reporter,  and he was a broadcaster.  These guys now,  they wouldn't know what the fuck to do  outside the studio,  but maybe grab a drink.  Yeah.  These guys, you know,  those are the old school guys  that actually did the footwork  and came back to the station  and put together their stories and stuff.  And, you know, 
[00:17:00]  that was the heyday of the news.  Now it's this...  What?  The fucking Nets dancers  are on the news this morning?  Ooh.  That's a really...  Yeah, let's watch what's on the news today  and compare it to what Walter Cronkite did.  They sit there doing these big tributes to him  while, you know,  you're just fucking over his legacy.  CNN is doing a big tribute.  Wow.  I guess you're getting away  from your ghoulish Michael Jackson coverage.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that it?  To do the right thing. 
[00:17:30]  That one?  Is Walter Cronkite going to have a public...  Yeah.  ...a public viewing at the Staples Center?  Oh, thanks.  Yeah.  All right.  The Tom Watson thing.  You got to hear the blown putt there.  I just saw it.  They showed it on one of the new channels.  Listen to the announcer  because if this is the clip,  the announcer goes,  he's going to do this.  He's going to win the British Open.  Oh, no.  Listen to this.  Jinx them.  That's an 8 to 10 footer.  I actually like this distance.  He can stroke this one.  He's going to make this and win. 
[00:18:00]  Oh.  Oh, God!  Good.  Good.  David it up there.  And so we'll have a four-hole playoff  with Tom Watson and Stewart Cink.  Watson bogeys the 72nd hole  with a zero confidence putt  at the pressure of the moment.  Just said he choked.  A zero confidence putt.  Was that what he said?  A zero confidence putt?  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  It was subtle,  but in the clip you hear it.  Yeah.  Because they were like,  what the hell just happened?  He sure fucked up, didn't he?  Yeah, the announcers in golf  are, I don't know, so-so.  Actually, the guys on SiriusXM,  they do a really good job  on the golf channel.  Really?  Yeah, they actually crack jokes  and just fuck around.  They fuck around a lot.  It's a lot of fun.  The main guy, I forgot his name,  but he's an older dude  and he's a lot of fun to listen to.  Back to Walter Cronkite.  Mark to Walter Cronkite.  They said that people around him 
[00:19:00]  in the newsroom would get frustrated  because he would need so many sources  before he would go on the air  with his story.  Yeah, he wouldn't just go on  with speculation.  And they would go,  Walter, this is happening.  Look, no, Kennedy's dead.  Let's go.  I need to see his brains  here on my desk.  Right.  I will not report the story  when I think it's right down my back.  The first clip we got,  President Obama remembers  Walter Cronkite.  We will not play that clip  because does he really remember  Walter Cronkite any more than we do? 
[00:19:30]  Right?  Shut up.  Shut up.  What would you...  Tax him?  Tax his body?  Sorry.  Got off on a little tangent.  Did you know he...  Very upset about the taxes.  You know that Walter Cronkite's  first assignment was pretty much  the Nuremberg trials?  Really?  That was one of the first things he did.  Actually, he covered  one of the wars, too.  But, um...  Yeah, listen to what he had to say  about the Nuremberg trials.  He covered the Nuremberg  war crime trials 
[00:20:00]  sitting just a few feet  from the Nazi architects  of the Holocaust.  Some of them were sniveling.  Gosh, you couldn't stand them.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Terrible man.  Yeah.  He wanted to get up there  and personally cut his throat.  Hess was obviously mad as a hatter.  They were absolutely insane.  Did he say...  Cronkite said you want to  personally get up there  and cut his throat?  Yeah.  Wow.  Good boy, Walter.  How great is that?  This was Walter looking back  on his career when, you know,  there was nothing to lose. 
[00:20:30]  So, yeah, he let it out.  Oh, okay.  I think that was him talking  about seven, eight years ago.  Wow.  And Hess.  Just never the normal person.  A mad hatter.  Just completely insane.  Mad as a hatter.  He'd come out and have  tea parties with rabbits.  How great is that?  He was sitting right next  to those guys covering it.  Fuck.  You would think they would have him  maybe in a different area  because when I saw the footage,  I'm like, wow, Walter Cronkite  did some nasty things  during the war.  Yeah.  Did we play...  Maybe we did.  Did we play the...  When he announced  the channel he's dead?  Oh, yeah, we got all that. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  When did he die?  It was Friday.  Back in 62.  Oh, stop being fresh.  Two girls, one cover.  We're now going to play  a clip that might shock you.  Two girls, one cup.  Why didn't they buy two cups?  If you don't like lighthouses,  you're a dick.  This was actually his...  No way, no how.  Mr. Balloon hat. 
[00:21:30]  He was seeing probably  all that stuff  the last day of his life.  Yeah, right.  Cronkite's first broadcast  on CBS News.  Good evening from our  CBS Newsroom in New York  on this,  the first broadcast  of Network Television's  first daily  half-hour news program.  Wow.  In Alabama today,  Governor Wallace  ringed a public school  with state troops  to delay integration  ordered by a federal court.  And in turn,  the local Alabama  school board  threatened defiance  of the governor. 
[00:22:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  That was his first story.  He did the first...  I didn't realize...  So he didn't take over  for anybody.  He started the whole  fucking thing.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's pretty much  the whole thing.  It's our first news  that will be  every half-hour...  Every day  for a half-hour.  And that's all you had.  Amazing.  That was all you had  back then, too.  It was like,  what's happening today?  One quick half-hour.  I have no idea  until the news comes on.  Yeah.  You just don't know.  No idea.  Occasionally,  it'd be like,  boop.  Will you interrupt this program 
[00:22:30]  to bring you  a special bulletin?  You know,  we're not even that old  and we saw some  ridiculous changes  in our lifetime.  You're right.  You take it for granted.  Right now,  we're looking at news  just around the clock.  We have eight TVs  in studio  and it's eight  different news channels  right now.  CNN,  Fox News,  the local affiliate,  PIX.  It just goes on and on.  CNN and MSNBC.  I mean,  it's just news 
[00:23:00]  all the time  that they can't find  enough news to film.  And you really make  a good point  because the newspapers  back then,  like,  first of all,  the news in the newspapers  to this day  is a day old.  Yeah.  But back then  it was probably even  a little more delayed.  You didn't get that  up-to-the-moment news.  But how stupid  were they back then?  The news is kind of important.  Like,  well,  we'll set aside  a half hour every day  to tell you  everything that's going on  in the country  and the world.  What?  You had to watch  being,  you know,  bewitched. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  It was very important.  The one thing I learned  about Walter Cronkite  when he did the famous  JFK announcement,  which we're going to do here,  he wasn't on the job  that long.  Nah.  He was only on the job  for a few months.  From Dallas, Texas,  the flash,  apparently official,  President Kennedy  died at 1 p.m.  Central Standard Time,  2 o'clock  Eastern Standard Time,  some 38 minutes ago. 
[00:24:00]  Vice President Lyndon Johnson  has left the hospital  in Dallas,  but we do not know  to where he has proceeded.  Presumably,  he will be taking  the oath of office  shortly  and become  the 36th president  of the United States.  You know,  most people say  that's Walter Cronkite's  finest moment  or whatever.  Like,  that is the highlight.  I think his finest moment  was when Apollo landed.  Yeah,  the Apollo landing  was pretty cool.  He loved space  and all that,  but did you see 
[00:24:30]  when he announced  that it landed?  He was thrilled.  He was like a little kid.  He was giddy.  He's smiling,  he's looking around,  he's wiping his eyes.  Have you seen that video?  Yeah,  that's a good one.  I mean,  obviously,  it's really tough  to beat the JFK  death announcement,  but he was just  downright giddy  like he was a little kid.  Well,  he might have also  been happy too  because Kennedy  predicted it too.  So if he liked Kennedy,  I mean,  that's obviously,  you know,  probably a tribute  to JFK as well.  But he's like,  he gave a like a wow.  He looked to his side  to whoever was like  off camera to the left 
[00:25:00]  and just had a real,  real moment.  It was just before  the end of the Dacard.  Dacard.  If you find that,  that would be,  you know,  worth taking a quick note.  Kennedy,  why are you hiding it?  And then,  uh,  Kennedy,  stop hiding it.  Cronkite,  uh,  had this moment as well.  Good evening.  Dr. Martin Luther King,  the apostle of nonviolence  in the civil rights movement  has been shot to death  in Memphis,  Tennessee.  Police have issued  an all points bulletin  for a well-dressed 
[00:25:30]  young white man  seen running from the scene.  Well,  officers also reportedly chased  and wasn't everyone  well-dressed.  I know everybody  you see back then  had a suit and tie on  all the time.  Even at baseball.  Even an assassin.  Even at baseball games,  you guys couldn't figure out  that you could take  your ties off?  Yeah,  it's casual.  Just hang out.  Suit jackets,  everything.  Yeah.  It's like,  come on.  When you work close.  I guess if you were out  in public,  you just had to dress up.  Everybody,  a well-dressed man  wearing a suit and tie  and nice shiny shoes.  Meaning every single person 
[00:26:00]  was a suspect.  Yeah.  ...unseen running  from the scene.  Officers also reportedly  chased and fired  on a radio-equipped car  containing two white men.  Dr. King was standing  on the balcony  of a second-floor hotel room  tonight when,  according to a companion,  a shot was fired  from across the street.  In the friend's words,  the bullet exploded  in his face.  Police,  who have been keeping  a close watch  over the Nobel Peace Prize winner  because of Memphis'  turbulent racial situation,  were on the scene  almost immediately. 
[00:26:30]  They rushed the 39-year-old  Negro leader  to a hospital  where he died  of a bullet wound  in the neck.  Do you see how,  this is the beauty of Cronkite,  he had a certain way  of speaking,  but do you see how  there's not this  fucking smarmy,  phony way of speaking  that the media does now?  Do you really think?  There's not the,  it was just a great  natural way of speaking.  Yeah,  now they editorialize  with just their tone  of voice  and the way  they present a story.  But then it was just,  hey,  here's the news.  And he sounds well-spoken 
[00:27:00]  but not put on.  Right.  He doesn't sound put on  like the news does today  when they try to enunciate  a certain way  or they try to sound  like they're not from  a certain part of the country.  He just,  he was just great.  Yep.  And then he rarely  editorialized  but he did  as far as the Vietnam War  went.  Oh,  yeah,  well,  that was a biggie.  Yeah,  this was huge.  They said once Cronkite  said the war was unwinnable,  you know,  right?  Pretty much made it  unwinnable.  That got the American  people like, 
[00:27:30]  all right,  well,  we're fucked.  One of Leonard B.  Johnson's aides  said,  yeah,  when he said,  well,  if we lost Cronkite,  we're done.  Lose the whole country.  We have that?  Yep.  It seems now  more certain than ever  that the bloody experience  of Vietnam  is to end  in a stalemate.  This summer's  almost certain standoff  will either end  in real give  and take negotiations  or terrible escalation.  And for every means  we have to escalate, 
[00:28:00]  the enemy can match us.  And that applies  to invasion of the North,  the use of nuclear weapons,  or the mere commitment  of 100 or 200  or 300,000 more  American troops  to the battle.  And with each escalation,  the world comes closer  to the brink  of cosmic disaster.  Jeez.  He could scare  the shit out of you.  Wow.  Cosmic disaster.  Cosmic disaster.  Cosmic disaster.  Just like a river.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Cosmic disaster.  The Martians have weighed in.  Man.  That was it.  Oh,  Wally Cronkite there.  Where did he say  it's unwinnable?  Because I remember that,  I've heard that clip before.  That was pretty much it.  I don't,  I'm not sure  he technically said  unwinnable.  I think it was that  the White House said,  oh my God,  Cronkite said  the war is unwinnable.  Yeah.  He might have.  Yeah,  I think the White House  paraphrased what Cronkite said  in that clip.  I don't know why I'm thinking  I can remember him saying it.  Like,  I've heard that before. 
[00:29:00]  Maybe I'm wrong.  And then one more.  Cronkite reports  the meltdown  on Three Mile Island.  I think this was pretty much  near the end of his career,  right?  Yeah,  probably.  When was Three Mile Island?  Late 70s?  78,  79,  somewhere around there?  Yeah,  somewhere like that.  Good evening.  The world has never known  a day quite like today.  It faced the considerable  uncertainties and dangers  of the worst nuclear power plant  accident of the atomic age.  And the horror tonight  is that it could get much worse.  It is not an atomic explosion 
[00:29:30]  that is feared.  The experts say that  that is impossible.  But the specter was raised  to perhaps the next  most serious kind  of nuclear catastrophe,  a massive release  of radioactivity.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission  cited that possibility  with an announcement  that while it is not likely,  the potential is there  for the ultimate risk  of a meltdown  at the Three Mile Island  atomic power plant  outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  Yeah,  and then you find out  later on  how close that was. 
[00:30:00]  Oh,  damn.  Real close.  Yeah,  that would have been  a good one.  What would have happened?  Well,  the core would have  reached temperatures  where it just melts  right through the bottom  of the containment unit,  hits groundwater,  and sends up  a plume of radioactive steam,  which just  pretty much  covers the surrounding area,  gets up into the atmosphere,  and kind of goes around  the globe a few times.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  Would have been a good one. 
[00:30:30]  Would have been a good one.  Happened,  you know,  Chernobyl had a real meltdown,  and so many people  over there  are still fucked.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know,  they still are keeping  a lot of that shit secret.  They just  pour concrete on it.  That's what we did.  We poured the concrete.  They sent these poor,  dumb sons of bitches  with, like, shovels.  You see them working  in Chernobyl  after the disaster.  They just got shovels.  Oh, my God. 
[00:31:00]  No protective anything.  They all just dying  left and right.  Look at this big  waterhead kid.  Danny's running  through some pictures  of Chernobyl.  Chernobyl kid's great.  Yeah.  A little byproduct  of the Chernobyl disaster.  Really was amazing, though.  And then they just  pour the concrete.  Well, what's going on  with Three Mile Island  to this day?  I guess it's fine now.  It can't just be fine,  is it?  Yeah.  I think they fired it back up  and everything's good now.  Really?  Yeah, everything's fine.  All right. 
[00:31:30]  They almost had a meltdown.  They didn't.  So that's...  Almost.  All right.  Everything's hunky-dory.  Let me say hi  to Loopy in Westchester.  Loopy.  Hey, how you doing there?  All right, Loopy.  All right.  I just wanted to point out  that Mr. Cronkite,  while reporting  his little Vietnam thing,  he actually said  the word enemy  when talking about  the enemy of the country.  He didn't sugarcoat it  and say, like,  oh, the insurgents...  Right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[00:32:00]  Thanks, buddy.  The enemy's ability.  Yeah, you're right.  The enemy's ability.  Yeah, we...  They just don't say enemy.  You're right.  They don't.  On the news for some reason,  which is just amazing.  God, that is a really good point  that Loopy just made.  Yeah, we just...  Just semantics  to try to change  people's opinions  on things.  Morons that actually  eat it up.  Mm-hmm.  And there you have it.  Walter Cronkite.  The passing of a news giant.  Dead.  They call him a news giant.  Yes.  He was old  when he was young. 
[00:32:30]  They showed a picture  of him on TV.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  He started  when he was 26 years old.  He already looked  like he was 50.  50.  He had to look like  the old respected newsman.  At 20, I guess.  What was he using  that old SNL prosthetic?  Like old people  makeup on him  or something?  This guy should have  never made it to 93.  He looked old  when he was a kid.  He really did.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Looks like Rodney Dangerfield.  Here I am at 18 years old.  He's got great temples already.  Well, that's when  he was actually  doing the news  at that point.  Because he started out 
[00:33:00]  as a reporter at 26.  God damn.  He actually had  his marbles and everything  right to the end.  Pretty close up  to the end anyway.  Yep.  Because I've seen  some interviews with him  just fairly recently.  And yeah,  seemed like he had it together.  Remembered a lot of stuff.  Was able to  put out a few  humorous anecdotes.  Was he in the service?  I saw him there  with a little hat on.  I don't mean to laugh  because we're talking  about Walter Cronkite  and the difference  between yesteryear 
[00:33:30]  and today.  Apollo 11 was  40 years ago  pretty much today.  Yeah.  Something like that.  And now I see  on the news  astronauts deal  with flooded toilet  aboard the  International Space Station.  Yeah,  they got like  too many people  up there apparently.  Why would that be news?  They got a clogged  toilet in space.  A clogged toilet.  That's how lame  we are now.  Looks like Snickers bars  floating all over  the inside of the capsule.  Yeah,  what was he?  Was he a journalist  or in the army  or I think he was 
[00:34:00]  what he did.  Yeah.  These guys were all  like you don't even  realize what they went through.  It's like,  yeah,  we did this  and then,  you know,  before that  he was in the war  killed like 50 people.  Yeah,  the good old days.  I think everyone  had a kill.  Everyone's spoiled now.  Everyone had a kill  back then.  You had to kill somebody.  Oh, yeah.  So you had that.  You had that with you.  Yeah.  World War I and II.  I mean,  you were talking about  Ted Williams  just before the show.  Yeah,  I saw a documentary  on Ted Williams  over the weekend  and I could give  a flying fuck  about the Red Sox 
[00:34:30]  and Ted Williams.  but you know what?  It was an interesting  goddamn documentary  about a person  I really didn't know  anything about  and he turns out  and I'm not,  you know,  for people that know him  it's no surprise  but what an interesting  fucking guy  and an amazing ball player  and amazing hitter  just on a jinxed  fucking team.  You know,  he was sitting there  talking about  the rivalry  yet camaraderie 
[00:35:00]  between him  and Joe DiMaggio  and DiMaggio  has like nine  World Series  fucking rings  and Ted Williams  none.  Did he ever win one?  No.  He came very close  very close once  and like  it was  it was like  the 86  fucking World Series  it just  they fucked up.  Wow.  You know,  I didn't know that.  Ted Williams  never got a ring.  I thought he had at least one.  He never got a ring.  Never got a ring.  I mean,  you know,  isn't that impressive.  That was it.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  But  and then you look at his stats 
[00:35:30]  which are amazing  and you realize  five years of his career  were gone  with World War II.  He was a pilot  in World War II  and then  during the Korean War  they hadn't trained  any pilots  between World War II  and the Korean War  so they just called up  the pilots  from World War II  and said  hey  now you got to fight  in this war.  Holy shit.  So there he was  Ted Williams  jumping in a jet  at this point.  Now he had to learn  how to fly a jet  and went out  and flew combat missions 
[00:36:00]  in Korea  and then  he gets done  with the war  and there he is  swinging the bat again  playing baseball.  That's just how it was  back then, right?  But  we're fucking  spoiled brats now.  You look at people  like A-Rod  and shit like that  and just go  this motherfucker  flew a jet  and killed people.  He crash landed  his plane.  This guy fucking  and then he gets out  and there he is  swinging the bat again.  Hey, I'm back.  I'm back from the war.  But that would be like  A-Rod  not playing for five years 
[00:36:30]  like you just said  and going over to  Iraq and Afghanistan.  And not just  hi guys  and waving  and then keeping them  in a safe place  or anything.  Like doing real shit.  Like getting in the shit.  And then coming back  and going back  into Major League Baseball.  You're so right  they're spoiled.  That would never happen.  Everyone's spoiled.  We're all spoiled  brats  in this country.  We need somebody  to come over  and spank our asses.  Wake us the fuck up.  Wake the fuck up.  Yeah, so I was watching that 
[00:37:00]  and just going  God damn  what an amazing fucking guy.  And it was kind of sad  at the end  because they're doing  that whole thing  about him being frozen  and somebody was talking  and just saying  you know  they don't talk about  Ted Williams  the war hero  or Ted Williams  the amazing ball player  it's Ted Williams  the frozen guy.  It's like  you know  I kind of chuckled  but it was like  oh god  that is true.  And a humanitarian  for the Jimmy Fund  you know  he's one of the first guys  that got on board  with that  and just took care  of kids with cancer 
[00:37:30]  and stuff  just like a real  decent guy  and a scumbag  to the press  but it was  it was kind of  tongue in cheek  at some times  like he knew  that's what the fans  wanted  and the fans  would cheer for him  when he did great  and boo him  when he did bad.  It was amazing  and he would just be like  you know  he'd spit at the fans  and shit like that  it was great  you don't realize  what a character  this guy was  for the time.  Well the family blew it  by you know  having them sever his head  and freezing his 
[00:38:00]  I know  and the son also  what the fuck  there's controversy  as to whether his son  actually  after many years  of not having  a relationship  with his father  finally did get one  and they did have  this mutual  respect and love  for each other  and he just figured  hey I can make  some money  and keep Ted out there  by having him  sign everything  but  other people say  that he was  an opportunistic guy  that used his father  to make a lot of money 
[00:38:30]  and then froze his head.  He said well you know  we don't have to  freeze his whole body  we can freeze his head.  That's the famous quote  and then I forgot  this too  that shortly after  Ted died  his son wound up  getting leukemia  and dying  from the very disease  that Ted Williams  used to help fight  with the Jimmy Fund  and things like that  he winds up  dying of that  at a very young age  so  a little 
[00:39:00]  a little  that cosmic justice.  I'm going to have  to take a peek  at that.  Can we turn off the TV  to watch Tom Watson  blow it over and over again  it's just heartbreaking.  Whoopsie.  And there's  Stuart Sink  they're politely  applauding when he won it.  What day was that?  And how about  Stuart Sink  takes his golf hat off  so he gets a little  sun on the top  of his bald head.  You see how white  it was?  Reddens up his head  a little bit.  It needs to be  reddened up a little bit.  We're going to go to break.  So Walter Cronkite  passes and we just  happen to have this  clip here to show you 
[00:39:30]  what the news has become  since Walter Cronkite  started it all.  Very good.  He'll be back.  Last night round two  I was around two o'clock  in the morning you see G.  Jesus.  I was flipping channel  on ESPN 2.  He had vintage McDonald's  All-American High School  dunk contest.  It was the year LeBron  won it anyway.  How I noticed  a certain kid from  home in Louisiana  dunking on people's heads.  The kid was Vaughn Wafer.  He's not a kid anymore.  When you splash 20  on the heads of the Gators  that's going to happen.  We all saw this coming. 
[00:40:00]  Wafer was without question  a guy we all expected  would fill the very  large season  to get left behind.  Sure the early season  troubles led some  to question  Wafer's ability to lead  but that's not  the problem anymore.  Wafer has stepped up.  Leads the Noles  in scoring.  It's clear.  So goes Wafer.  So go the Noles.  Check in on some  big time college  basketball.  Georgia Tech  and Miami.  That's Guillermo Diaz.  He is going to hit  a three there.  He had 27.  Miami up to a good  start.  Georgia Tech  with a big first half. 
[00:40:30]  Will Bynum.  He'll hit that.  He had 21.  Put on your dancing shoes.  We still have a lot  more to go.  That's including business.  The delight of it all.  On Wall Street  the Dow is up.  Oh my God.  That's what it's become.  That's what it's become.  Waller Cronkite.  Those guys had a fart.  They probably had a fart  more than we have  to fart today.  Oh my God.  Imagine a Cronkite fart.  They were still  coffee and cigarettes  and they were still  drinking whole milk  thick as fucking syrup. 
[00:41:00]  Syrup.  Oh Walter you stunk  up the studio.  Yes I did.  The tech offensive  happened last night  as North Vietnamese  troops came down.  He's not laughing.  As the North Vietnamese  attacked many bases  and the tech offensive  oh it smells like  shit in here.  Imagine if you farted  during the Kennedy  announcement.  Yeah.  One  C.M. 
[00:41:30]  Central time.  Did the guy  who farted laugh  or was someone else  farted?  I don't know.  Fuck him.  It's great.  Smells like spoiled meat.  Let's go to Mike  in Florida.  Mikey.  Hey guys what's happening?  Hey Michael.  I live in this little  shitty tiny small town  in Florida  where I have no idea  why but Ted Williams  lived here for like  the last 15-20 years  he was alive.  And it was  wait it's a shitty  town in Florida  you would think that  you know Ted would  be set up nice.  No he had a nice house.  I actually do glass work 
[00:42:00]  and I did mirrors  and stuff in his house  and his daughter's  house and stuff  but lived up on  a big hill  but this construction  company down here  I won't say their name  the guy that owns  it's a billionaire  and he was  with his son.  Doyle Hargrave  construction?  No.  Oh okay  just wondering.  They would actually  my dad worked there  for many years  about 11 years  and many times  they would have  an entire office  of balls and bats  and stuff set up 
[00:42:30]  and they would drag  Ted Williams in there  in a wheelchair  the guy could barely talk  and have him sign  for hours and hours  and hours.  Jesus.  That was his son  and the owner  of that place.  God damn.  They're some pretty  big dirt bags.  I wonder if that brought  Ted Williams some happiness  at the end of his life though.  Well apparently  I mean it's very obvious  that the son  kind of took advantage  and was a scumbag  but you wonder  if that actually  was good for Ted.  I don't know.  He kind of liked  still being in the public eye  I think when they  brought him out  in that little golf cart 
[00:43:00]  during the All-Star game  and all the players  came up to him  like royalty  you could tell  he was digging it  he tipped his hat  which was a big  kind of an early  trademark of what he did  and then he stopped  doing it  and all the players  came up  and just treated him  like royalty  and he seemed  to really enjoy that  he got into fishing  after he retired  he was just like  obsessed with fishing  fly fishing  that's what he did  that don't fly fishing  all kinds of fucking  like look at these monsters  that they would catch 
[00:43:30]  these monster swordfish  and shit like that  but then they'd show him  in the rubber waders  you know  out in the river  doing that kind of  so it was like  and he kept making  his own lures  things like that  so  is there anything worse  than fly fishing  knocked off  I guess he was in that  you know something  I know someone's  going to call  and now defend it  but  maybe when you've  ravaged entire villages  with gasoline bombs  you have to just  pick a peaceful river  to just kind of  make amends with God  I don't know  maybe that's what  goes through his head 
[00:44:00]  when he's fly fishing  by hooking other animals  in the face  and pulling them out  for no reason  and way to be peaceful  Ted  I think  I think our old boss  is a fly fisherman  really  Tom Chiasano  I think does  fly fishing  he had to handle  the horror too  so  yeah  he went through  a few wars right  yes  he certainly did  I don't get  the fly fishing though  nah  when you cast  you want to feel  that heaviness  and  you never watch  the river runs  through it  oh my god  it's fabulous 
[00:44:30]  it's all about  fly fishing  you're trying to  cast a feather  basically  what fun is that  you gotta go like  keep throwing it out  and out  and bring it back  and I don't know  I'm always afraid  you're gonna hook  your eyeball  and then if there's  a two mile an hour  wind  you can't even  get it in the water  because it just  keeps blowing  back into your face  and you're all proud  of the one you made  you gotta hold it up  because you wound  some string around  a hook  with a feather on it  shut up  who gives a fuck  buy something big  put a piece of meat on it  be a man  and get a lure  what the fuck 
[00:45:00]  you just keep throwing  how do the fish  ever get it  Jimmy's mad  I'm mad too  because they don't even  reels it back in  they don't even  give it time  to be in the water  it's like Bill Hicks  fishing  who's this creep  and you can't be  bouncing above  the water like that  I wonder if that's  why he wears glasses  keep the fucking thing  and pin them in the eye  just in case  the hook comes back  at you  yeah but look at that  wow  wow  he's getting it out there  he's taking line out  what the fuck  this is stupid  yeah and then they'll  sit there with like  a mile of line  in the water 
[00:45:30]  like reel it in  or something  I don't understand it  yeah  look he's not even  using his reel  he's just pulling it  it's gonna get tangled  oh my god  he knows what he's doing  how annoying is that  it's terrible  looks like he's fucking  he's in S&M  he's whipping the river  now I know he has to do that  in order to cast it out  because it can't  you can't really cast it  off the reel  you gotta kinda  pull it out  and then  and then throw it  and throw it  ooh it's young Howard  oh my god  why is young Howard  fly fishing 
[00:46:00]  I wish you had visuals  here people  because  this popped on  and within two seconds  everyone looked like  it looks like  the WNBC  he's got the  short hair  and the mustache  so tall and gangly  or John Holmes  that's great  no it is like  a dead ringer  for Howard  that's funny man  that's funny  ooh ooh ooh  I'm fly fishing  Robin  even the close up  wow  that is funny as shit  that's amazing  how close that is 
[00:46:30]  alright  see I knew  we'd get one  Brent in Oklahoma  Brent  hey LNA  I love you guys  thanks sir  I'm just gonna  straighten you out  on this fly fishing deal  when you're fishing  with a lure  ooh ooh  ooh ooh  ooh ooh  ooh ooh  no I understand  you don't understand  the concept of it  yeah  yeah I thought  maybe I'd say  well that's true  we are  we're ignorant  I named my real  Allison  we are ignorant 
[00:47:00]  hold on Brent  there is a video  once again  it looks exactly  exactly  exactly  like a young Howard  like WNBC era  Howie  yeah  anyway  so Brent what  fly fishing enthusiast  alright  the short's not him  we got a link  there's  yeah  somewhere  he goes up  to eat the bug  what  he doesn't  the fish does not know 
[00:47:30]  he ate the bug  what  Brent  the fish  comes up  and eats a bug  your phone  your phone  really did crap out  so what happens  start over  I understand  I'm in Oklahoma  so it probably is  crapping out  now we got you  so go  the fish is swimming along  he looks up  and he sees this bug  on top of the water  right  he decides  he's gonna eat the bug  so he swims up  splash  you see the splash  of the fish  right  so that's when  you cast out there  now the fish  doesn't realize  he ate the bug 
[00:48:00]  so he looks back up  to make sure  the bug is gone  and there's your bug  on the end of this  fly rod  and now it's replaced  but with a hook  right  so the fish  is so stupid  he doesn't even know  he just ate it  it's a little more  intelligent fishing  than fishing  with a lure  or dragon  hold on  wait a minute  intelligent fishing  how smart do you have to be  to beat this animal  psychologically  picture yourself  in a diner  and you order cake  and you eat it 
[00:48:30]  and a minute later  you turn around  and there's a big metal  hook on your plate  and then you go  oh I guess I didn't  eat my cake  and you put it  in your mouth  and King Kong  reels you through  the window  what a dumb animal  the fish is  what are you doing  it's not a chess match  sir  you were dumber  than that fish  because I think  after you ate  you would look back  at the plate  and go holy shit  there's a shrimp left  I gotta eat that  and you would eat it  and get hung  I still don't get  what the fly fishing  is about it  there's an actual  fly in the water  yeah  yeah let's say 
[00:49:00]  there's a bug  on the water  see so he's looking  for  hold on Brent  he's looking for  a little like a  bloop  the fisherman's  looking for like a  bloop  where the fish was  and when he sees it  he goes oh  and he casts out  to that area  now the fish  ate the bug  but the fish  is so stupid  that he kind of  looks up  looking for the bug  he just ate  or maybe he's just  looking for another bug  I don't think  one bug's gonna  fill up a fish  you're right  Brent doesn't even  know how to do it  Brent  he's not looking  to see if he ate  that particular bug 
[00:49:30]  he's looking up  to see if there's  any more bugs  he could eat  Anthony probably  knows this  the mayfly's  real name  is the  hexagenea lumbata  I know  anyway  that's like  a steak dinner  to a brook trout  that's like  a steak dinner  to a brook trout  is it  just like  and there's  millions of them  on top of the water  so maybe  they are looking  for another meal  but primarily  they're faked out  we go from golf  to fly fishing 
[00:50:00]  what's next  badminton break  coming up  after the break  we got badminton  coming up  but I like the fact  that you're in  the psychology  of the fish  you think he was  faked out  when it's obvious  he thinks  there's another bug  hold on sir  it's gotta be  another bug  who first thought  that the fish  was psyched out  who first thought  the fish  was faked out  who talked  to a fish  and said  give us a replay  of what happened  and the fish  said I thought  it was the same  bug that I didn't eat  they've done studies  on these  no they haven't  they never know  how do you study  a fish 
[00:50:30]  has no arms  have you watched TV  instead of cruising  trannies for a change  what's that buddy  oh wow  that was really hurtful  have you watched TV  instead of cruising  trannies some days  no  I haven't  nor will I  that's how I  that's how I pick up hookers  I throw my penis  out the window  and they don't realize  I didn't pay them  and they blow me  and leave  see Jimmy tricks  to trannies  using the fly fishing logic 
[00:51:00]  he pulls down his fly  is it obvious  that the fucking fish  is looking for another  dumb bug  yes  like how would he know  the fish didn't know  he ate the bug  that's silly  and he's looking up  for the bug  that he just ate  right  when you  yeah  just instead of looking up  and going  that was a tasty bug  where's the nether  what do you sit the  the fish down  and ask him  these questions  one on one  well  I thought  all right 
[00:51:30]  microphone works  underwater  I have no clue  so we'll take a break  now  yes we will  we gotta get the instant  feedback working  it still says  what  11pm last night  well that's crazy  and that is crazy  what happened  because if that's the case  I'm going to bed  yeah  I was watching  actually at that point  I was in bed  but I was watching  I believe Predator was on  nice  which if that's on  you will always watch it  but two things  I was very annoyed  that I was watching  Cinemax HD  which is high def 
[00:52:00]  that's what the HD  stands for  and they say  that their movies  are in high def  or whatever  and there's Predator  in a little shit  TV aspect ratio  4.3  really?  yeah  and I'm like  what  why not just  at least show it  in a 16.9  if it's the high def  channel  I know  maybe not even  a high def copy  of Predator  I don't even know 
[00:52:30]  if one's available  but at least show me  in the aspect ratio  so I'm not  getting half the movie  in pan and scan  that bugged me  and then  just seeing Jesse  the body in there  all I could think of  was  let's just coat him  with thermite paint  we'll coat  the Predator  with thermite paint  and explode him  as a matter of fact  the atomic bomb  that goes off  at the end of Predator  is thermite paint  I just could not  get thermite paint  out of my head  watching that movie  now he's ruined  that movie for me 
[00:53:00]  well look at back  is he a good actor?  no  I don't have time  to bleed  oh really?  he's not that good?  hey you're bleeding  I don't have time  to bleed  he wasn't in the movie  all that long  to tell you the truth  he's one of the first guys  that gets taken out  his chest gets blown  completely out  it's a great scene  but um  and that's also the one  with uh  the famous  the famous drop  Dylan  which when he said it  I chuckled  when you hear  when you hear our drops  in the movies  they came from 
[00:53:30]  it kind of takes you  out of that movie  you know what  you know which one  I think has the most  Arnold drops ever  is kindergarten cop  that one is  every other line  is from our show  from that  Dylan  that's the one  where it walks in  Dylan  and he sees Apollo Creed  Dylan  who's named Dylan  in this for some reason  not Apollo Creed  is that what he's saying  Dylan?  Dylan  Dylan  and then he shakes  they shake each other's hands  real manly  and they show  they do a close up  what did they have you  pushing pencils?  I love when they show  old combat guys 
[00:54:00]  getting together  in a movie  and they both  just give a horrible  yeah what have you  been doing there  we're putting hats on  and they're just  terrible dialogue  yeah we're putting  hats on  writing signs  what  I'm talking about  yeah  where they got you  pushing pencils  down dear  the fly  oh is this it?  you want  pot it up a little bit  because nobody  messes with Joe  everyone's got to  make a fucking  parody of something  you can't find  the original shit  anymore 
[00:54:30]  you sons of bastards  language  hey we got fly  fishermen just  calling like  crazy  this guy  Pete Frost  before we go to  the phones  from Georgia  I've been fishing  35 years  and caught two  trout  not easy  for 35 years  why would you  fish for 35  years  to catch two  fucking fish  what are we doing?  no someone made  another  horrible video  but  that's how they  shake hands  and the world  explodes 
[00:55:00]  let's say hi to  Richard Montauk  Richard  hey how you doing  Anthony I met you  at the gun shop  when you won  the two pistols  oh what's up  how you doing buddy  listen I'm from  Montauk I fish  offshore for  marlin and tuna  it's similar  to what he's  talking about  we throw out  two teasers  fake lures  right  or a set  of lures  okay  yeah  the fish  comes up  goes after  the lure  gets all lit up  we drop back  two live 
[00:55:30]  bait fish  or bait fish  that are  cut a certain  way that look  like they're  swimming  right  the fish  jumps from  the fake lure  onto the real  fish  because you can't  keep dragging  live fish  because it'll be  ripped up  you know  because you're  trolling  so you're  right  the bug  teases  the bug  drops down  the fish  comes up  then he would  put out the  fly  jump on the  fly  so it's  kind of  similar  in the concept 
[00:56:00]  that sounds  like the worst  activity in  history  wait a second  you never  caught a  600 pound  blue marlin  I haven't  no  have you  Jimmy  no why  would I  for what  for what  someone else  will catch it  for me  and they'll  cook it  for me  it's a sport  Jimmy  for some people  it's not a sport  it's not a sport  go in the water  with your fists  and punch the fish  that's a sport  you're standing  in a fucking  boat  it's not a sport  you have a hook  and the fish  has nothing  but hunger  it's not a sport 
[00:56:30]  a bunch of  fucking fat  fucks  drinking  pabst blue  ribbon  trying to hook  some asshole  fish  whatever  the fish  how is it  a sport  if the fish  could never  know that  was coming  the fish  is just  kind of  swimming around  and all of a sudden  there's metal  in his mouth  it's not a sport  if you hop  in the water  and dress  like bait  and then the fish  shows up  and you hook  him with a hook  on your fist  that's a sport  but you're in a boat  it's a skill 
[00:57:00]  to get the fish  up  it's not a skill  you're tricking  a prehistoric animal  it's a real skill  to get the shrub  to stand still  while you trim it  shrub trimming  that's a real sport  you have to sneak up  or the bush  will run and hide  no it won't  it's a bush  it's not a sport  it's a fucking holocaust  it's not a sport  yes I'm saying this  the fish have no chance  of winning  are you bothered  by fishermen  and hunters  Jimmy  not hunters  it's a holocaust 
[00:57:30]  not the holocaust  your reactionary  dopey fisherman  shut up  a holocaust  what I'm saying  is this  here's what I'm saying  I'm sorry  you have the timing  of a stroke  you just keep babbling  we're talking here  hunting  I don't mind a guy  who's fishing and hunting  and then eating  what he catches  or whatever  I got no problem  with that  my point is  don't look at it  like it's a sport  you're not a sportsman  I'm just letting you know  you're not a sportsman 
[00:58:00]  what's a sportsman to you  a guy who competes  with others  I'm telling you  a sportsman is a guy  who competes in a way  with other athletes  doing the same thing  that's a sportsman  that's why there's  50 or 60 boats  fishing at the same area  no no  you're competing  with other men  to hook a fish  the direct competition  is the animal sir  the direct competition  is the fish  it's the dopey  prehistoric  fucking one cell  brained idiot  that you're trying to hook 
[00:58:30]  that'd be like  if you just ran out  and tried to punch  retarded people  that's a sport  I try to lure them  with cotton candy  on my fist  you know what  that's pretty accurate  that is pretty damn accurate  no I never have  I get seasick  I have about  a million times  yes  let me tell you something  I'm an expert  you're not  good you're an expert  so you know  that what you're doing  is not a sport  just admit that  it's fun  you like to do it  why doesn't you ask  Opie  I don't  why doesn't you ask  Opie 
[00:59:00]  I don't know  I'll tell you  what else you haven't done  apparently you didn't  read a lot  while you're on the boat  do you  you just fucking  throw that thing  in there  Richard you might  want to leave me  out of this  because I probably  would have agreed  with you  until Jimmy's rant  it's not a sport sir  you're not a sportsman  you're not out there  sporting  Jimmy has a hard time  distinguishing some  sports from others  or thinking  some things are sports  and this  he doesn't happen  to think is a sport  I'm not saying  you're not an athlete  but I'm saying  when you're fishing  what was that line again  the fish is hungry  and you're what 
[00:59:30]  you have a hook  and the fish has hunger  how is that a sport  you're teasing the fish  to come up  to see what's on top  exactly  because we make  we make the whole  teasers look like  bait fish  let me ask you a question  why don't you  is NASCAR a sport  somebody's right  yes of course it is  why don't you go in there  why don't you do this  if you want it to be a sport  why don't you dress like  something that the fish  would eat  and then when the fish  comes up  you knock its fucking  block off  I don't believe in NASCAR  because I hate left turns  but you understand 
[01:00:00]  what I'm saying though  because they make  a lot of left turns  so why don't you  if that's a sport  why don't you go  shark fishing  why don't you jump in there  and trick the shark  even if you have a weapon  in your hand  hand to hand combat  with the shark  why don't you do  that's a sport  I don't need to do it  I'm not saying it's a sport  I'm saying what it is  when you're doing  some kind of sport  there's got to be  a winner  and a loser  so how does the fisherman  lose  I mean  we don't get the fish  to the boat  yeah but when a fish  loses it pretty much  loses its life 
[01:00:30]  yeah what are you risking  unless you're you know  we don't kill them  catch and throw  what are you risking  catch and release  whatever yeah  huh  it's the adrenaline rush  catching a blue marlin  standing up  and fighting it  for an hour  maybe two hours  maybe three hours  okay so you're risking  basically an adrenaline rush  while the marlin is having  the inside of his face  ripped apart with a hook  for hours  you give him a little trophy  in the winner's cup  when he wins  what do you give the fish  when he wins  just a scraped up mouth 
[01:01:00]  and he sent him home  now he's afraid  to eat anything  you know how many fish  probably become anorexics  holy shit  does this guy  just fucking babble  just babbles  that's why Karen Carpenter  suffered  because she went  to eat one time  when someone threw  a hook in her mouth  and she was afraid  it would happen again  no I'm not gonna listen  you haven't listened once  every time I've tried  to be funny  you just trample over  you're like  you're like the fucking  Blitzkrieg  of course I'm funny sir  of course I am  you're like the Germans  in fucking  in World War 2 
[01:01:30]  I'm trying to make a joke  and you're just kicking in  my fucking  my national front door  so are you suggesting  we change like  the rules of fishing  maybe like  if the fisherman  has to lose something  if he doesn't bring  the fish into the boat  like he gets the inside  of his mouth  scraped out  I like that  he has to eat hot soup  something  he has to smash  his own fist  with a mallet  he's gotta eat  a box of Captain Crunch  with no milk  he's got the shards  of flesh  let's change the rules  inside of a  a marlin's mouth 
[01:02:00]  is wood  so it doesn't affect him  Rob Sharp does  I'm sure they love it  I'm sure marlins  laugh about it  when it's done  did a marlin tell you that  that it doesn't hurt him  or affect him  that's the only places  and they swim away  because we recover them  and we bring them  to the side of the boat  and we push water  into your gills  call your brother  who's a marine biologist  and verify my  you're not a sportsman  I'm not saying  you shouldn't fish  you're not a sportsman  what  NASCAR's a sportsman? 
[01:02:30]  NASCAR  here's the difference  and I'm not a NASCAR fan  but it's guys competing  with each other  and a machine  not a live animal  that has to be tricked  into coming up  thinking it's gonna eat something  there's a difference  between two guys  in a machine  matching each other  equally in skill  that's a difference  at least you could say  that's a sport  I'm not a fan of it  but it is a sport  both men are risking  equal injury  equal death  and the deck is stacked  equally between competitors  it's not stacked equally 
[01:03:00]  between a dumb fucking fish  who has been doing  the same thing  since dinosaurs  were shitting  all over Manhattan  do you understand  that fish was no smarter  when a tyrannosaurus  was shitting  on 70th street  and Broadway  I agree with that  as much as I say  that I gave up  shooting animals  now I do target  because I don't think  that's a fair sport  then you know my thinking  so stop trying to defend it  the fishing should be called  what are you gonna do  I'm gonna go out  and massacre some fish  that's what it is  I guess the sport 
[01:03:30]  is that you're  competing against  other fishermen  and they don't even  acknowledge that the fish  is anything  that the fish is part of it  how about this  why don't you  and the other fucking  dopey fishermen  try to hook  each other's eyeballs  that's a sport  you and some other  jizz bucket  in fucking waders  and a big gut  standing there  in 10 degree water  hook each other's eyes  with a fly fishing reel  that's fucking a sport  what happened to Bill  I ripped his thumb off  I won  it's like going to Brazil  and picking up  this guy is just the worst  he's not even entertaining  to do radio with  he just  you gotta hang up on this guy 
[01:04:00]  we gotta get someone else  he just  he just babbles  John in Illinois  what's up John  but that's what a thing  should be like  if you throw out  your fucking hook  and you pull off  the skin between  a guy's pointer finger  and thumb  the webbing  the webbing  that's three points  you pull off  another guy's finger  and toe webbing  and you win  or his upper lip  if you rip off  an upper lip  that means it goes  to extra innings  oh god damn  Phil in Brooklyn writes  ESPN ran a clip  last week of a guy  jumping out of a helicopter  into the ocean  and wrestling a blue marlin  to submission  that's a sport 
[01:04:30]  yeah I've seen that  I didn't see that  is it cool  it's that new show  that's friggin catch  is it called  or something  where yeah  it's guys in the water  catching fish  like with their bodies  there you go  that's a sport  and giant fish  with huge teeth  I want to see a clip of that  let's go to John  in Illinois  John  hey it's Sean  hey Sean  love you guys  love the show  I do think you're funny  and I'm not trying  to stomp over you  or anything  but I think you're  dead wrong on this  but I think  fishing is a sport  it's recognized 
[01:05:00]  as a sport  by pretty much  everybody in the world  except you  no dude  I'll tell you  that's just my opinion  bro  don't you know  you bash me  or whatever  I'm not bashing you  I was only bashing  the other guy  because his timing  was horrendous  he would just babble  I just don't think  it's a sport  because to me  you're competing  against what is  basically  an absolute  dumb  fucking  instinct driven  lunk  fish are lunkheads  I think  they're blithering idiots  you're obviously  competing against 
[01:05:30]  other fishermen  you're pretty much  taking the fish  out of the  out of the whole  mix really  the fish is the ball  yeah  like you're playing  tennis  you're competing  against another  tennis player  but you're making  it like you're  competing against  the ball  I'll tell you  one thing  those fucking  lunatics that put  their arm  in the  noodling  yeah the noodlers  that's a sport  then  I would say so  look at the size  of these fucking  fish  I would say that  hooked  the show's  called hooked  yeah  might have to 
[01:06:00]  get a guy  from hooked  on the  that looks  sick  let's go to  Gary in  Michigan  Gary  hey how's it  going boys  hey  just listening to  all this talk  about fly fishing  and everything  I do a lot  of bass tournaments  which are  kind of a lot  in the same  but that's what  I was actually  on hold for  is just to say  the fish is  kind of like  the ball  but there's  also some  variables there  depending on  the time of year  whether they've  spawned  whether they  haven't spawned  whether you're  fishing for  largemouth  smallmouth  whatever  but anyway  you know  you got  50 morons  like myself 
[01:06:30]  out there  trying to  catch five  fish for  their biggest  weight  you got  millions of  different  lures you  can use  you know  so depending  on what  your scheme  of things  is  you may do  good  and you may  go out there  and not catch  a damn  thing  you know  when I  fished  I just  considered  a leisure  activity  yes  sure  yep  absolutely  and that's  okay too  let me see  what kind  of lures  my dad  got laying  around  from when  he was  fishing  20 some  odd  years ago  and I  fucking  put one  on my  rod  and see  what I  could get  I would  throw some  bait on there 
[01:07:00]  and throw  the hook  in the water  and wait  for it to  go  tink  tink  tink  and then  you pick  it up  and hope  you hook  the fish  and reel  them in  you ever  go to  a store  that sells  the gear  for fishing  yeah  it's insane  what it has  become  it's ridiculous  I mean  you know  you get out  on the lake  at 4 in the  morning  who the hell  wants to do  that  you know  you're out  there all  day  turn to make  it's over  at 3.30  by then  you're hungry  tired  and the sun  burnt  and I  don't know  why the hell  we do it  but it is  a lot of  fun  to say the  least  it's a good  activity  that sounds  awesome 
[01:07:30]  I would love  to be on  a lake  at 4 in the  morning  I would love  that  to be on  in the  middle of  the water  as the sun  is coming  up  that would  be cool  as hell  I would hate  that  it would make  me have to  shit  I would have  to shit  fishing just  reminds me of  being somewhere  with no toilets  and like my  little body  would start to  just like  fucking knock  on my colon  and I would  have to shit  all day  you'd be  your ass  over the edge  of the boat  yeah  big fish  would come up  and bite  the shit  out of your ass  chaplain  walk into  the fucking woods  Charlie Chaplin  walk  dude  it's been a problem 
[01:08:00]  once or twice  that's for sure  but I'll tell you  what guys  you got some  hellacious  smallmouth  fishing right  over by you  just catch  the east end  of Lake Erie  get a charter  over there  one day  for smallmouth  you guys  love it  it's not  close to me  they had an article  in the paper  very recently  that there are  a lot of people  that are fishing  in Manhattan  for dinner  yeah because of  the economy  yeah  well I mean  and just because  they're flat out  poor it doesn't  even matter  about the economy  and no one  is willing to say  that that is  really really bad 
[01:08:30]  because you know  it's so polluted  the fish they're  pulling out of there  they don't even  want to test  the river is so  polluted  you know what  another sport I enjoy  is this is a great  sport is I go  where there's little  turtles and I put  out a snack  and when they put  their little heads  out to eat it  I punch their  turtle faces  not snapping turtles  where I can be  injured of course  I just little  innocent toothless  turtles I punch  their turtle faces  that's another sport  I engage in  and baby kicking  that's a good one  people show me  their baby and I  kick it  because that's a  great sport  I win every time 
[01:09:00]  have you ever  lost  no  except when other  parents move the  baby and I try to  kick it like Charlie  Brown  but Jimmy a lot of  people would say  that's very mean  and cruel  exactly  what you would do  to the baby  exactly  two winters ago  I was somewhere  up in Connecticut  and I was driving  by like a small  lake or a large  pond whatever the  fuck they're called  when they're in  between a lake  and a pond  I don't know  what you call  them  and there's  it's completely  frozen over  and there's a guy  out there fishing  I parked my  fucking car  and I marched  out to him 
[01:09:30]  and I actually  said this  I'm like  what are you  doing  what are you  doing out  he's just out  in the middle  of this like  lake  it's freezing  it was like  single digits  the wind's  blowing  he doesn't  even have  a seat  he's just  standing there  no radio  no beers  nothing  and he's just  waiting to get  bites in the  holes he made  in the ice  that's insanity  it annoyed me  so much  that I parked  the car  and I marched  out there  and I said  what are you  doing  explain this  to me  no reason  for it 
[01:10:00]  it's very  peaceful  out here  you don't  hear anybody  it's time  to yourself  you get to  just be with  nature  and freeze  to death  I understand  the guys  that you  see pictures  where they  set up  nice huts  and stuff  and they  drive the  cars out  in the middle  of the lake  and it  becomes a  whole weekend  thing  look at him  drilled a hole  in the ice  and now he's  fishing in there  and freezing  you just saw  the guy  put his hands  back in his  pockets  like I'm  fucking  freezing  why am I 
[01:10:30]  out here  not for me  that I don't  understand at all  by the way  you were talking  about Ted Williams  we got the  instant feedback  working so  we're a little  behind here  but someone  wants you to  know that  Ted Williams  was not  playing in  1986  yeah because  that's what I  said  that's what I  said  did I even  come close  to saying  that  no  it's amazing  they're listening  to the same  show  I said  there was  a circumstance  where  the Sox  got very  close to 
[01:11:00]  winning  like  86  not that  Ted was  playing  in 86  you dumb  son of a  bitch  let me go to  Justin in New York  Justin  what's going on  guys  hey man  the fishing  thing  the whole thing  that I think  people are missing  is that they're  like offended  that they're  participating  and they  can't separate  that from the  fact that it's  an activity  and not a  sport  you know  like I was  telling the guy  who answered  the phone  I train MMA  like four days 
[01:11:30]  a week  and I refuse  to believe  that that's  equal to  fishing  you're right  exactly  MMA is a  sport  they should  just call it  something else  that's all  and then everyone  will be happy  dude  I'm sorry  I'm watching  a video  of ice fishing  ice fishing  this guy  is putting  his arm  in the  water  that they  drilled through  and he's  pulling up  the fish  his hand  has to be  frostbitten  that is a  giant fish  he just pulled  out of there  dumb fish 
[01:12:00]  you're under  the ice  and you come  up through  a hole  doesn't it  dawn on a  fish  that's how  stupid  fish are  this is how  dumb this  animal is  you live  under ice  and all of a  sudden a  hole pops up  and treats  are dropped  into it  that doesn't  strike you  as odd  if you're  a fish  that's like  walking around  in a room  and the ceiling  opens up  and candy  is dropped  and you go  oh  and you put  your head  up through  who's the  dropper  of this  candy  their motives 
[01:12:30]  must be  good  I think the  fish is like  oh what a  nice caring  human  he thinks  it's god  a magic  treat hole  has been  opened  by whatever  god I  worship  this has  never happened  before  let me just  lead with my  mouth  I love how  Jimmy can  simplify shit  that's a good  point  wouldn't the  fish go  what the  fuck is  this  I think  I'm gonna  move away  from this  weird hole  that just  appeared  especially  when you  see like  eight of  your friends  have just  been ripped  through that  hole  never to 
[01:13:00]  return  if a hole  ever appears  and of course  we do the  whole female  joke thing  but if a hole  appears out of  nowhere are you  like exploring  or going  what  the fuck  is this  here's an  expression  fish need  to learn  too good  to be  true  is this  guy fishing  with a  radio control  helicopter  now that's  a sport  that's a sport  that's pretty  funny  because how do  you keep those  fucking things  in the air  to begin with  and now you're 
[01:13:30]  fishing with it  very difficult  let me say  hi to Matt  from pal talk  he ice fishes  all the time  so now we got  the ice fisherman  pissed off at us  just enjoy the  comedy  jesus christ  cares  Matt what do  you got  hey  I am certainly  not pissed off  at you guys  at this  absolutely not  no I just  want to add  to the conversation  that I ice fish  all the time  through the winter  and it's just one  complete drunk  fest out there  these guys just  sit out there  in huts and  diddle over a hole  and stuff like that  that's crazy  I had no idea 
[01:14:00]  how they just  sit out there  in the cold  you gotta bring  venison steaks  out there  cases of beer  I mean you're  out there  drinking at  630 in the  morning  I like that  part  no I sort  of understand  that  what you just  described  what I saw  a couple winters  ago was just  one guy  it was like  the coldest  day of the  winter  out there  by himself  there was  no fun  whatsoever  he had his  hands in his  pocket  and he was  waiting to get  hits off  those  it's weird  what they set  up because  they're not  even using 
[01:14:30]  poles  what are they  called  they're  ruskies  those guys  those freaking  russians  that go out  there and do  that  they're ridiculous  I mean it's  a line in the  water but it's  not connected  to a rod  it's like an  apparatus they  set up right  on the ice  and then if  the flag pops  up you know  you gotta hit  they're called  tip ups  alright thank  you tip ups  yeah yeah  you put them  out there  put a shiner  down below  the hole  and you just  kinda hang  out  yeah yeah  and so what  else are you  gonna do  you gotta bring  brew out  there  but oh yeah  we bring  right after Christmas  in January  you bring a 
[01:15:00]  freaking Christmas  tree out  stick it in  the hole  douse it with  gasoline  pour it  set it up  on fire  it's a big  joke out there  yeah  but see  sitting around  all day  I mean  we're out  there 10  12 hours  a day  sometimes out  there  and you just  you go through  an 18 or  24 pack of  beer in a day  it's a joke  I could see  where it would  be fun  in that  you know  hang out  with your  friends  whatever  yeah of course  you have a  little hut  whatever  as long as  you're not  cold  you have fires  on the ice  and shit  I don't want  to be freezing  yeah  it's changing  diapers  right on  alright brother 
[01:15:30]  thank you  we were gonna  break but these  calls are way  too good  Willie in  Georgia  Willie  yeah what's  up guys  hey man  hello Willie  I tell you  man I live  down here in  the south  and everybody  fucking fishes  except me  and these guys  they try to  take me out  to go tournament  fishing and stuff  like that  and I tell you  it's the most  boring goddamn  thing on earth  you go sit in  a fucking boat  it's really  really hot  only good thing  about it is  you can drink  but I can do  that shit  in the comfort  of my own 
[01:16:00]  home on a  computer looking  at porn  you know  it's kind of  boring out there  but it's you  against the  fucking fish  you know  how smart  is a fish  I caught  him  and the big  deal  it's not like  I caught  gold  I caught  a damn  fish  I love how  Jimmy looks at  stuff man  a hole  appears  it doesn't  occur to the  fish  it's not  good  also there's  light  where there  was no  light  and if a  fish has  such good  eyesight  it can see  a bug  why can't  they see a  string coming  off the  end of  something  have they  ever seen 
[01:16:30]  another wild  animal being  tugged along  by a rope  would you  ever go to  grab a bag  of M&M's  if there was  a string  pulling it  all through  the rope  of course  you wouldn't  this is a  fucking rig  this is not  good  you gotta think  the odds are  good they had  some of their  friends pulled  out of the  water  that might  clue them into  this isn't a  good situation  and it can't  be good  there's no  good reason  a string  can be  it's like  you can't  be going  to grab  food  with a  string  on it  and the  motive is  to pull  you to  a happier  place 
[01:17:00]  what do they  think is  happening  like a  giant fish  is trying  to pull  him to  a place  where  snacks  are  aplenty  and doesn't  it bother  you that  your treat  has a big  piece of  metal  sticking  through  it  fish are  blithering  idiots  let's go  to Trish  yeah Trish  is stupid  I hate  her  why  I like  her  Pete  in Connecticut  Pete  hey how's  it going  guys  yeah  it seems  to me  like  fishing  is more 
[01:17:30]  of a  puzzle  than a  sport  because  it's like  you know  I don't  know what  kind of  lure  I need  today  so I  have to  try  different  lures  until I  figure it  out  it's like  figuring  out a  Sudoku  puzzle  I like  Sudoku  well  love the  Sudoku  but would  you call  it a  sport  I call  it  a time  killer  well  Tiger Woods  is loading  up the  next hole  I do  a quick  figure in  my  Sudoku 
[01:18:00]  puzzle  very good  it's not  a sport  though  I don't  fucking  know  thank you  sir  what about  this one  Jimmy  Jeff  in New  York  Jeff  yeah  hey  you gotta  do it  like  where I  grew up  like  the  Native  Americans  did  those  fuckers  went  out  and  dynamited  the  river  the  bull  head  all  floated  to the  top  of the  river  they grab  them in  a fucking  net  and then  have a  sail  right there  on the  side  of the  road  all right  look I  I have  American Indians  look  it's a bit  of a  different  you know 
[01:18:30]  they had a  huge piece  of property  here  and let's  be honest  they didn't  handle it  well  I tend  to look  the other  way with  the American  Indians  you don't  think  they  handled  it  well  I  really  don't  I  think  they  were  very  well  meaning  people  I  think  they  got  some  nice  stuff  out  of  what  did  they  give up  Manhattan  for  oh look  it's shiny  here's New York  come on  you know  I don't understand it  ooh a few blankets  for Manhattan  deal  how come the guy  holding those blankets 
[01:19:00]  is coughing  we were the first  terrorists  Jimmy  one more  cigars  and scotch  cigars  scotch  how are you sir  hey what's good guys  hey Jimmy  how do you not relate  to the fish  in ice fishing  you're a rough  stop veteran  go with it  that's  glory hole  for fish  okay you know what  so we're only  catching the gay fish  a glory hole  for fish  that is funny  man  that's funny  but can you imagine 
[01:19:30]  if you put your dick  through a hole  in the wall  expected to get it  sucked  and all of a sudden  you were pulled  through the hole  by a giant piece  of metal  here's the thing  now you know  a glory hole  is there  that's different  that's something  we know  is there  can you imagine  if you were just  walking through  say the mall  and all of a sudden  a hole appeared  in the wall  and you heard  would you run over  and put your dick  through it  or would you examine  it first  you wouldn't just  believe that that  was there  to feel pleasure  through it  you'd get  suspicious  yep  alright  what 
[01:20:00]  let's see  how to Scott  of Brooklyn  Scott  hello  hey buddy  hey  had a comment  for Jimmy  hi  hey Jimmy  you were talking  about how fish  are stupid  and you know  they should know  better if there's  a hole in the ceiling  and treats drop down  but come on  you know if a hole  popped open in the ceiling  and a tranny prostitute  that was willing to  drop a log on your chest  was there  you know you wouldn't  go running the other way  here's where you went 
[01:20:30]  wrong on that one  you try to put  too many things  in one  yeah  you should have  just said a log  if a hole opened up  and a log dropped  through Jim  you'd eat first  and think second  which I wouldn't  of course  I would question  why is there  doo doo falling  from the ceiling  and I don't eat  doo doo  it's all a joke  Oscar in Indiana  Oscar  hey guys  how's it going  hey Oscar  Felix always leaves  the place messy  what's up Oscar  he's all dumb  fish  he's been  three or four hours  out there  on the lake  or whatever  catching fish 
[01:21:00]  you get one  you rip half his face off  throw him back  and 45 minutes later  you catch the dumb  fucking fish  there you go  there you go  yeah see  you're right  yeah  that's a sport  you sat there  you did nothing  fish are as dumb  as they come  Pat  yep  hey guys  hey  every year  I travel back up  home to New Hampshire  to do some ice fishing  we use the tip ups  like Opie was saying  and you know  you put some bait  down there  fish bites 
[01:21:30]  and you pull it up  things like  oh pound  you feel bad about it  so you throw the fish back  you know  give it two  three minutes later  fucking fish bites again  same fish  oh same fish  rip it  lungs out  and throw it on the ice  say fuck that thing  yeah alright  I gave you a chance  for now  fuck you  yeah  thank you sir  and finally  Wes the trucker  Wes  hey boys  hey  not only  is Dragon Wagon  a truck driver  he's also  a deep sea fisherman  and with that 
[01:22:00]  we go to  our first break  the day after  Jim Norton's birthday  oh  we'll ask you  about Jimmy's birthday  next  Opie and Anthony  hi  hi there  Opie and Anthony  show  hole in the sky  Sabbath  oh  wow  that's a very good  choice  because hole in the sky  yeah  and the hole  for the fish  in the ice 
[01:22:30]  Opie and Anthony  show  it's Monday  I know  deal with it  deal with it  I just made a duty  Opie had to  slink some chum  down the toilet  I didn't catch nothing  fish comes up  through the hole  in the bottom  of the toilet bowl  no that's where  the snakes live  backwards noodling  yeah  that's where the snakes live  yeah they certainly do  Bobo had a hard on  and Sam  did some reporting  Bo Boner  who's being called 
[01:23:00]  yeah  Bobo  gave us great radio  on Friday  love him or hate him  I mean when you get  Louis C.K. calling  saying  oh my god  I had to pull over  to call you guys  because I was laughing  so hard  and I had to tell you  just that  and he wasn't even kidding  like he did  pull his car over  because he was afraid  of having an accident  yeah  because he was laughing  it's like no no  you're not  you're not making him  do that  no Iraq is not  doing this  you missed a good one  what did Iraq do  well Iraq had to smell 
[01:23:30]  Bobo's pubes  that was just one of the  many things we did  on Friday  it was waffling  there was so much  going on  with young Bobo  Friday  one of which was  yeah  he was afraid  he was afraid  to shave himself  which he desperately  needs to  because  there's the picture  because he's afraid  he doesn't want  his razor  to smell like  his dick  it's like  well  shower 
[01:24:00]  wash  wash  your fucking  shit  and he's like  no it's dirty  and  we made  Iraq  smell it  how to smell  from Iraq's reaction  of throwing up a bit  and gagging  I didn't hear it  pretty fucking bad  can I hear it  yeah we could  get some clips  look at that  two inch bulge  in the front  of Bobo's pants  and Bobo  would pull down  his pants  and a string  of pre-cum  went from the tip  of his dick  to his underwear  all the way  down to his ankles 
[01:24:30]  why is he so  turned on  because he  was thinking  in his head  he was thinking  about what  could happen  with Christine  with the girl  down the hall  why don't we get  a girl to do a lap dance  and come in his pants  we got it  you don't even need  a lap dance  he was coming  in his pants  just thinking about it  he was fucking  freaking out  yeah  here's one of the clips  from Friday  for Jimmy  now Erod  give a good sniff  get a good sniff  we want you really close  he's not gonna 
[01:25:00]  push your face  you gotta get  on your knees  point it at me  don't point it at me  your eyes going  on the side  give a good sniff  stay there  don't move  don't move  get close  real close  and you gotta get  right by the hair  get in there  right by the hair  and give his  eyes  I think Erock  is starting to puke  could I pull my pants  up please  oh god 
[01:25:30]  this is horrible  could I pull my pants  up please  please  wow  yeah it was  it was  I don't know  there was so much  going on on Friday  why does he wash his dick  so most of the people  you know  followed the  oh god  followed the whole  bobo thing on Friday  Sam what'd you do  so after we left  he was walking around  with a hard-on  no it wasn't  I saw everyone  tweeting pictures 
[01:26:00]  of Bobo's hard-on  that was  he was fine  yeah  then he started  talking to Christina  and having a conversation  with her  and you saw the boner  appear  yes  and she at one point  went over to Troy  and goes  oh my god  Troy does  does Bobo have a boner  right now  and we all realized  that he did  so actually  E-Rock  of all people  had a brilliant move  where he said  he wanted to take  a picture of Bobo  and Christina  but he needed Bobo  to look good  so he told Bobo  to tuck in his shirt 
[01:26:30]  so that way  Bobo's shirt  was tucked in  and his  full erection  was on display  for everyone  he's got a strong boner  because the thing  you know  points straight out  to begin with  and those pesky pants  didn't stop it  it's tiny  but it's mighty  it's strong  and like at first  people were just  kind of making jokes  as if he didn't realize  everybody could see  but since  you know  Walter Cronkite  is an inspiration  of mine  I went in as a reporter  and just  got to the facts 
[01:27:00]  hopefully his activities  on Friday  will be an inspiration  for you too  and now  backstage  with ONA  here is  Primetime  Sam Roberts  I'm Primetime  Sam Roberts  and after a successful  ONA show appearance  show star Bobo  was talking to his  girlfriend Christina  in the serious offices  while talking to her  Bobo quickly  and obviously  became fully erect  we went to Bobo  for comment  Bobo  um  what's 
[01:27:30]  going on  well I'm talking  to her about  I'm trying to figure out  like  Christina you mean  yeah like  how long would it take  before she's  uh  before I banged her  right  and uh  all this talk  does it have you  feeling a bit excited  uh  yeah  but I  I know  I don't know  how long it'll take  but I'm sure  the payoff  will be big  now  will the payoff  be as big  as the erection  you obviously  have right now  uh yeah  and maybe  she'll get a big  payoff also  if you know  wink wink  by that you mean  the erection 
[01:28:00]  that you obviously  have right now  yeah but  she's gonna get  a big payoff  alright  now I can see  it right there  are you bashful  at all  about the fact  that you're  walking around  a place of business  and you obviously  are fully erect  well unfortunately  when you're  they kind of have  to expect this  crazy stuff  when you're  in the same  building  as the  opie and anthony  show  yeah they have  half retards  walking around  with boners  I don't even  I think I'm  less than half  return  a quarter  me  yeah a quarter  is probably  the right description 
[01:28:30]  do we have any  uh  possibility of  a bit of leakage  or something  happening today  I'll find out  when I get home  anything about that  you'll know after  but you're fully erect  yeah  Bobo proudly  displayed his  erection for  Christina  who didn't look  terribly impressed  we reached out  to her  for the exclusive  so Christina  what's going on  with you and Bobo  today  well uh  currently  right now  I'm actually  staring at his  boner  yeah is this  something that uh  he looks to be 
[01:29:00]  very pleased  he's been erect  for a good ten  minutes  yeah  which is impressive  it goes on and  off sometimes  no  he looks to be  very prideful  about the fact  that uh  you're staring  at his erection  is that something  that he should be  proud of  yes uh  he did mention  before that  I should buy  an array of  different size  condoms  magnum especially  so I mean  I can't help  but check out  the good  based on what  you see in front  of you  would you think  that magnum  would be an  appropriate size  I would have  I would have to  oh he's shaking  it out now 
[01:29:30]  it just grew  even more  I would have  to say  after him  shaking his  leg  yes absolutely  and by yes  you mean  no not at all  we thought the  story would end  there but just  as the backstage  crew was packing  up their equipment  ONA producer  Danny approached  Bobo with a ruler  to get an exact  measurement of the  bow boner  maybe in Canada  it's bigger  could someone tell me  what size it'd be  in millimeters  oh yeah you are  rocking  Danny has a ruler  by Bobo's crotch  right now  Danny 
[01:30:00]  if you could give us  the official  if you could give us  the official  measurement of  Bobo's erection  it's  we're about  two and three  quarters  so he's doing  pretty well  could someone show  me in millimeters  what it'd be in  Canada  alright so you're  a full three inches  is that something  you're proud of  three inches  I feel fine  but if it can  get to eight inches  that'd be better  will Bobo get to  eight inches one day  certainly not  but that won't  stop him from  doing his best  to sexually assault  any woman he meets  regardless  I'm primetime 
[01:30:30]  Sam Roberts  and this has been  Backstage  with ONA  eight inches  maybe if we hook it  up to a pickup truck  or something  yeah he's like  I'm like an eight  he's very pleased  about it  like he was proud  like when it was  pointed out he wasn't  like oh my goodness  I'm so embarrassed  no  like he you know  decided to put his  pelvis out  what he doesn't  understand is  this is not a work  in progress  that's as big  as the cock  gets  that's it  he seems to think  there's a lot  of growing left  no no  over Johnny  and the fluorescent 
[01:31:00]  light is just  so telling  the black light  look at  is that the black  light  yeah  did a black  light test  on him  look at all  the shit  all over  his pant leg  the light  doesn't lie  this guy likes  he's got  comesies  all over the  place  not a little  just drop  there's  comesies  everywhere  during the  the whole  Beau Boner  episode  we did notice  towards the  very very end  that there was  a little wet  spot that was  growing  on a little  bulge of his  pants 
[01:31:30]  because the  thing about it  was  it kept  it would go  down  because you  could see it  it would go  down when like  the topic of  conversation  moved on  but all you  had to do  was say  hey Boner  hey Boner  hey Bobo  what do you think  Christina looks like  without her shirt  on  and he'd start  doing his  and you could  see it  and everyone  knows if a  Boner goes up  and down  too many times  it'll just start  leaking like  an old  fucking gutter  it's that easy 
[01:32:00]  to get him  to pop a  Boner  if you get  her  you have to  get Christina  in studio  and all you  have to say  is like  you know  Bobo  imagine if  Christina was  in the shower  right now  he freaks out  and gets a rod  his big  two and three  quarter inch rod  I know Bobo  shows up on  Fridays  if he doesn't  show up on  Friday with  sweatpants on  he's not allowed  up here  because we're  going to do  some testing  we're going to  be doing 
[01:32:30]  some boner  testing on  Friday  we should put  him in  bicycle shorts  right  yeah he really  should be  in something  you know  sweatpants  might not  show up  in  because they're  so loose  and he's  only two  and three  quarter  we might just  need something  loose  where you know  the boner  has you know  room to  breathe  Bobo's on  the line  we'll keep  it short  Bobo  what's up  everything's  fine  I have to  say I had  the amazing  time at  a feast  for at least  I can tell you  only today  did I recover 
[01:33:00]  from that  hangover  yeah  oh wow  putting back  a few  that's great  tell the whole  world we  over serve  that's smart  Bobo  you guys  did a great  job  actually  we had to  watch him  for the last  two hours  to make  sure  he was  okay  really  yeah  was he all  just  fucked up  because I  mean  some  of our  fans  are just  fucking  animals  well  some  are animals  like dude  no he doesn't  need any more  trust me  it's time  for water  for Bobo  Bobo come on  we're gonna do 
[01:33:30]  shots  right  people are  retarded  but then two  listeners were  nice enough  to drive him  home so  you got home  safely  obviously  yeah I got  home safely  if you  consider two  guys that  had no clue  how to use  a GPS  oh yeah  yeah these  guys  it freaking  took three  hours  and it  would just  take maybe  a half hour  from Huntington  to Queens  it took you  three hours  to get home  what did they  do to you 
[01:34:00]  that's what  someone said  like I wouldn't  let those two  guys bring  them home  you blacked  out  two brothers  two brothers  driving Bobo  home  that just  it didn't  sound good  at the time  and Anthony  was on to me  well no you  weren't on to me  but I got  someone I can't  trust anymore  well  it was after  the fact  so  Jimmy I was  gonna and I  swear to God  we were this  close and then  I got lazy  we were gonna  drop Bobo off  at Anthony's  house ring  the doorbell  and run  do a ring  and run  at my front 
[01:34:30]  fucking door  not even like  just talking  about it  like we were  getting ready  and I was like  I don't want to  drive all the way  there right now  hello  the door would  just slam in  his face  he would be  asleep on my  front stoop in  the morning  or whatever  or drown in  my pool  he would have  been fucked  he would have  had to sleep  on your lawn  yeah  he would not  be in my house  I'm kind of  bummed now  I didn't do  but I just  got lazy  just put a  camera on him  like I  take a laptop  camera  just put it

[01:37:30]  that would  be an honor  to use  to get a  bodu in  your pants  Opie  I'll bring in  the famous  smelly sweatpants  I think the  idea of white  bike shorts  is better  because even  though they're  snug you'll  still get  quite a rod  in them  it'll be  very obvious  and he does  have a powerful  one  two and three  quarter inches  of power  we're gonna  have a contest  to see who  could make  Bobo  pop a boner  first  it's that easy  you're saying  Sam  oh yeah  I was making 
[01:38:00]  him pop  boners  all afternoon  I'm the best  paint a picture  yeah  and that's  all right  you gotta be  careful with  the bicycle  shorts though  they do  keep everything  down nice  not that much  believe me  I have a pair  of white  bike shorts  for when  special friends  come over  and I'll  stand there  with my arms  on my hips  like Superman  no you won't  oh yes I will  and I have  I'm garbage  I do an  excellent  pet impersonation  when I'm drunk  a what  a what  impersonation  pet impersonation  when I'm drunk 
[01:38:30]  oh  so he's stealing  now Jimmy's  impression  let's hear it  let's hear it  Bobo  well I was just  drunk so I  just noticed it  and I said  wait a minute  I noticed I was  drunk but I said  wait a minute  I sound a little  bit like Ted  so someone just  asked me to do  the voice  and I just did  the voice  I am  looking at the  paranormal  you sound like  Marianne faithful  it sounds better 
[01:39:00]  drunk  yeah  dude  is that  is that  photoshopped  I hope not  it's the best thing  I've ever seen  as a matter of fact  for some odd reason  I do a good  tippy tom  when I'm drunk  well I read  your twitter  and supposedly  Bobo's got a  project he wants  to tell everyone  about  yeah that's right  I got a  youtube series  in the works  he's doing a  youtube series  yes  what  I forgot  I'm a ghost  loosely based 
[01:39:30]  on tippy tom  and I'll be  playing the part  of tippy tom  it's loosely  based on him  but the character  is called  tippy tom  and Bobo's  playing tippy tom  in a youtube  series  and what are  you going to do  well I'm going to  play the part  of tippy tom  the pilot's  going to be  filmed at  fh riley's  I'm writing  the pilot  oh really  oh really  did you ask  Brett  the fine owner  of fh riley's  yeah  I never even  saw Brett  there  but I got  I saw him  you got to  let him know  about this  because  a lot of 
[01:40:00]  fans have been  wanting to see  this one  what are you  going to do  a lot of fans  huh  I'm actually  going to dress  like tippy tom  and spray liquid  ass on myself  oh and you  want to hang  out at my  restaurant  yeah okay  on you boob  yeah great  no that's wonderful  I think Brett  will agree like  this immediately  I'll wake him up  because he needs  to know  are you insane  not only that 
[01:40:30]  though  of course  it's fictional  tippy tom  lives in queen  yeah but the  smell's not  going to be  fictional  because he  lives in queen  right  so you're  going to smell  like shit  in fh riley's  and then what  what happens  walk us through  well I'm going to  act like tippy tom  well I'll actually  get  maybe get  a couple  of budweiser's  and I'll do  the whole  do you think  I'm sexy song  during the first pilot  and then people  are going to talk  about tippy tom  like it's like 
[01:41:00]  tippy tom  like he's  like what  the way it's  going to work  is I'm going to  like someone  is going to say  oh this guy's  like he sleeps  in the bus stop  at the q18  and he's always  creeping out  everybody that  gets off that  bus  and then maybe  one person  will say that  they tippy tom  tried to rape her  he's a lunatic  I see  this guy is insane  I see 20 million  hits  first day  yeah you're  on to something  I'm going to  come up with  a lot of stuff  in future episodes  but the pilot's  going to be  at FH Riley's 
[01:41:30]  I already got  someone who's  going to  alright let's  slow down  with the pilot  being at FH Riley's  first of all  no I love that idea  it's a familiar  surrounding  people know it  it'll boost  the popularity  of the place  yeah  this is going to  be fantastic  FH Riley's  film here Riley's  FH Riley's  you insist on  the FH Riley's  part of this  huh  yeah well  I know  it's a deal  breaker  it looks a little 
[01:42:00]  bit like my  neighborhood  there's a lot  there's a lot  of bars in my  neighborhood  yeah  and I thought  I'll use this  location for the  pilot  and then I'm  going to bring  like  anybody who  appears in this  pilot  stuff about my  neighborhood  so they can  get the idea  of what  FH Riley's  to become  Bobo do you  need me to  close down  the restaurant  for a day  for the  taping of  the pilot  for the big  shoot  hopefully a  Friday or  Saturday night  what do you  need a Friday  Saturday night  you want to  horrify the  customers on a 
[01:42:30]  Friday and  Saturday night  because that's  when we're  doing very  well  so you think  a Friday night  at FH Riley's  which by the  way if you've  been there is  a relatively  small place  people have a  visual in their  heads  but it's a  medium sized  restaurant  we pack them  in on Friday  and Saturday  nights  big time  you're going  to walk in  like a homeless  fucking bum  smelling like  shit  on what planet  does this work  I don't know  I like it  Ant  I say it's a 
[01:43:00]  go  it sounds good  green light it  it sounds like  a really good  idea  you need any  backing  cameras  financing  lighting  I got some  of that  well  what I would  need is I  would need  cameras and  someone to be  able to edit  it  this whole  video  well you want  me to drive  you over to  Ant's to  check out  his equipment  because he's  got some  nice equipment  that you might  be able to  use for this  I'll just bring  it to FH Riley  tonight he has  liquid ass  all over him  but you have so  much stuff I  think he needs  to go to your  house downstairs  in that beautiful  room of yours  and just look  around and see  what he needs  you know he's  too much of an 
[01:43:30]  amateur as to  that I'm  professional I  know what he  needs I can  bring it down  he's the guy  I'm taking three  showers after every  filming  you're going to  take three  showers after every  filming  can I ask you a  question Ant how  happy would you  be if he walked  into FH Riley  on a scale from  one to ten  it's hack to go  over ten but I  have to  what did my  brother do to you  I know what I've  done to you but  what about my  brother he hasn't  done shit to you  it's just the idea  it's just the idea  it has nothing to do  with you or Brett 
[01:44:00]  or the idea of him  walking into that  establishment  there's a few  restaurants we  wouldn't mind  Bobo walking  into let me tell  you that much  let me tell you  that much  perhaps an alternate  location there's a  few restaurants that  need a little visit  from us a shitty  smelling Bobo  all right Bobo  we can't like have  you on the radio  all day yeah not  all the time it  drives some of the  people nuts  by the way before  I go though when I  film this pilot  everybody says  talk to me as of  a tippy tom  oh so you want 
[01:44:30]  other people to be  in character too  he's a method  actor yeah yeah  you can't have  other people  I gotta get to  make to make it  believable as if  it is tippy tom  as if he's back  from the dead  so you'll never  break character  while you're  dressed like him  yeah while I'm  filming  we're kind of  which one of your  lines of dialogue  Bobo  yeah give us  one line of  dialogue  it's great  so you kind of 
[01:45:00]  become the  character  that's amazing  yeah your channel  is amazing  well I'm  actually doing  some research  by listening  to tippy tom  audio  audio  audio  audio  can I please  put my pants  on now  that's great  there's another  great line from  that where he  goes see now  you know I'm  embarrassed  or something like  that  you gotta get  that line for  Jimmy  alright Bobo  you keep us  updated on your  project  yeah Bobo  alright you 
[01:45:30]  have a good  day I gotta  leave that to  my job anyway  have a good  day  wait did we  find out what  he does at the  day camp  he keeps everyone  in line  that's it  yeah I keep  I pretty much  keep everybody  in line and if  I have to I'll  yell at them  let's hear you  yell at somebody  alright guys  stop getting  into a fight  I don't want  to be liable  for any lawsuits  here  cool talk to the  kids in language  they understand  yeah liability  and things like  that  they're working  on tort reform  these kids 
[01:46:00]  seem pretty smart  a lot of them  Shannon knows  because there's  people that  stay away from  you  smarter than  the person  that's watching  them  that's always good  how old are  these kids  they're anywhere  from high school  students to  little kids  little elementary  school students  yeah  oh Jesus  and a lot of  them recognize  me from the  neighborhood  yeah I bet  from the posters  that the parents  put on the  telephone poles  these are all 
[01:46:30]  local  these are all  local kids  alright  as a matter of  fact though  I'm a little  bit different  at home than  I am on the  air  oh  we see  Tom has  hold on  Bobo  hold on a second  I know I'm a ghost  when you're  fucking talking  but I actually  need to be heard  right this second  because Tom has  a very good  question for you  Tom go ahead  you got Bobo  on the line  yeah  hey I was  going to see  if Bobo  would consider  doing his  premiere of the  movie at 
[01:47:00]  Anthony's studio  holy shit  is that a great  idea  oh my god  I mean the pilot  is filmed at  FH Riley's  and then it's  premiered at  dance theater  this is  this is  perfect  I don't  think I  have enough  room  for the  listeners  that would  want to  see this  how perfect  is this  come on  I'm thinking  no no  most premieres  you only  invite special  people in  it's perfect  no I'm thinking  a full size  movie theater  is needed  for this  situation  we could  sit some  people on  the floor  I mean 
[01:47:30]  Tom has  a great  idea  here  I'm not  feeling it  you can fire  up that  popcorn machine  for everybody  how about  we just  show it  at FH Riley's  see your theater  is bigger than  FH Riley's  you know that  you know that  it'll be like  wow this is  where it was  filmed  it's almost  like watching  it on location  you know  your theater  is bigger  than FH Riley's  now you're  just being  silly  you guys do  know  that I smell  live appearance  you do understand  that if we had 
[01:48:00]  any brains  we would tie in  a live appearance  to the Bobo  movie premiere  oh of course  and that would  be an event  and people would  come to the  Bobo movie  red carpet event  as long as  Bobo shower  then of course  we could have  that at FH Riley's  that's a nice  green right there  my friends  we're not stupid  alright  oh yeah  everyone said  I said quick call  so we gotta get  rid of you Bobo  alright you have  a good day  I'll see you guys  Thursday  alright thank you 
[01:48:30]  for my birthday  card  can we hear  it one more  time  can you  wait  you're gonna  get tired  of this  never  well  feeling blue  horrible  how great  would that  be at a  funeral  I'm very  sorry for  your loss  oh my  Jesus  holy  I'm very  sorry for 
[01:49:00]  your loss  struck down  the problem  of his life  by a drunk  driver  a little  something  for you  thank you  get up  make you feel  better  do a dance  do the dance  hey remember  our old  our old  pal  man  cow  yeah  apparently  he still  somehow  thinks he's  relevant  I don't  know where  he is  I swear 
[01:49:30]  to you  I don't  know where  he is  or what  he does  I think  he's on  a bunch  of small  AMs  like real  tiny markets  around the  country  in these  little towns  trying to do  that political  horse shit  yeah  he thinks  he wants  to be  Hannity  so bad  and he's  failing so  miserably  at it  and  I take  it on  one of  these clips  he bashes  a satellite  right  yeah  yeah we  have a  satellite  by the way  if you  look  and google 
[01:50:00]  news  the Opie  and Anthony  show  it just  you know  stories pop  up  stories pop  up all the  time  you know  big ones  little ones  things that  people say  on our  show  are recognized  as things  that are  in pop  culture  and  comments  from people  that  you know  are newsmakers  we're regularly  featured on  Breepart  whatwithtylardurdendo.com  and where  is  man  I haven't  seen  one clip  from his  radio show 
[01:50:30]  being featured  anywhere  no  nothing  I didn't  I swear to you  I thought he was  off the air  I thought he was  just sitting  out  well this pile  of horse shit  was on  Jimmy Fallon  I love horse shit  I mean I got  in these battles  I should say  I got in these battles  I'm still with the  fake voice  even though I  reinvented myself  these guys  with their stupid  fake voices  start with that  use your real  voice  and then maybe  you'll get  respect in this  business  where's that 
[01:51:00]  disc where they  all sound the  same  I gotta play  that again  guys please  everyone's  getting tense  is he trying  to say  is he trying  to say  that like  he won  all these  battles  because I  don't know  of one radio  battle that  he actually  won  every  fucking  guy  oh  stomped  on him  stomped  on him  he's not  going to  say that  he won  a radio  battle  against  Howard  the question 
[01:51:30]  that led  into this  clip  was Jimmy  Fallon  mentioning  all the  radio wars  he's been  in  including  Howard Stern  and Opie  and Anthony  oh he  mentioned our  name  he did  Fallon  loves us  by the way  loves us  can't wait  to have  his back  570 AM  he's on  570 AM  in Washington  apparently  and I got a  question for you  though  seriously  what do you  think  little Nicky  thinks of me  I don't know  little Nicky  it's Monday 
[01:52:00]  and we're  discussing  man cow  he's changed  his look  a little bit  yeah I don't  think he  really wants  to be  little Nicky  anymore  I think he's  slowly changing  his look  call me  little Nick  he's starting  to realize  that this  show suffers  from OCD  and it's  never going  away  unless he  changes  his look  oh we're  looking at  the man  cow  empire  what other  great stations  is he on  his website  so bad  he's got  white text  on a  white background  so you'd  have to  highlight it 
[01:52:30]  to see  he wants  to hide  that market  but he's  out from  2 to  5 a.m  what  2 to  5  who the  fuck  is listening  to America  from 2 to  5 a.m  what is he  talking about  5 to 8 a.m  in Stockton  Stockton  we already  took a phone  call from  fucking England  today you  fucking douche  we're worldwide  oh my god  he's on  all these  little  and our  bits are  fucking  being featured  on some  pretty prominent  websites  these days 
[01:53:00]  so he was  on Jimmy Fallon  with his fake  voice  let's listen  on this  I mean I got  in these battles  I should say  I won  we're on 60  stations  we're doing  well  we haven't  been sent  over to  satellite  we're in  the mainstream  and I was  able to  reinvent myself  and do a  show for  regular audiences  they had to  go off to  the graveyard  that would  be Opie  and Anthony  and Howard  Stern  oh really  we're in  the graveyard  over there  here at the  graveyard  are you kidding  me  like Hans said 
[01:53:30]  I didn't even  know he was  still doing  radio  I gotta be  honest  if you're  doing something  that's really  good you don't  need to reinvent  yourself  why reinvent  yourself  I've reinvented  myself  from a douchebag  to an asshole  very hard to do  more white text  on white background  what you're trying  to figure out  what markets  he's in  in Houston  and he calls it  the free speech  radio network  ugh  boo  what the fuck  you talking  about  free  boo 
[01:54:00]  be more funny  1150  a.m  that isn't  the time  that's the  frequency  1150 a.m  in Corpus Christi  wait he's on  at 1150 a.m  no I'm confused  I'm confused  what  it's way over  you actually  gotta crack  your knob  on your  radio  does he  dial go up  to 1150  I don't know  no  that's shortwave  you can actually  cook food  if you tune  into  it's microwaves  if you tune  into  Van Gogh's show  and you put  a sandwich  close to it 
[01:54:30]  it will  heat up  in Houston  he's on  Mondays  from 2 to  5 a.m  but Tuesday  through Friday  they won't  give him  that precious  2 a.m  spot  so he's  just 3 to  5 a.m  Tuesday  through Friday  this is the  guy that  won the battle  he won the  battle  he's on  AM stations  in the middle  of the night  and then you  click on a lot  of states  and there's  just nothing  are you  kidding me  a lot of  these states  he's competing  with John  and Jeff  John  the overnight  those guys 
[01:55:00]  always take  the tough  the tough  angle  child molesters  are bad  whoa easy  guys  oh my god  where is  that  was Man Cow  really on an  episode of  Penn and Teller's  bullshit about  profanity and  censorship  we gotta find  that  we need to  know what  Man Cow  has to say  on that subject  and then he  had this to  say  on Jimmy Fallon  real quick thing  before you go  satellite radio  would you ever go  no you know  I don't believe  okay look 
[01:55:30]  you fucking  douchebag  you wanted to  be on satellite  radio  we know for a  fact you ass  we have a lot  of people in  common  guess what  satellite radio  didn't want  you  didn't even  so of course  you're gonna go  no I never  gotta go  real quick thing  before you go  satellite radio  would you ever go  no you know  I don't believe  in charging people  to see you  or to hear you  it just doesn't  seem right  in your case  we do a show  where we'll fight  for comedy  well yeah I mean  if no one's  gonna come  for Man Cow  I would agree  right  ugh  but wait 
[01:56:00]  not believing  in charging  people to see  you  so Sopranos  or The Wire  or HBO  or Comedy Central  you're charging  people for all  those services  or Hollywood  you don't charge  people to see you  everything's free  any movie that  you go to see  stand up comics  a concert  everything should  be free  and way to be  in touch  I mean regular  radio is heading  toward charging  right  yeah  there's a lot  of discussions  going on  like I don't  think we can  keep this  free anymore 
[01:56:30]  with what's  going on  with you know  the fees  they gotta pay  to the record  companies  they're in a weird  spot that regular  radio  they don't know  what the fuck  to do  real quick thing  before you go  satellite radio  would you ever go  no you know  I don't believe  in charging people  to see you  or to hear you  it just doesn't  seem right  we do a show  where we're  fighting for  common sense  we're fighting  for the regular  person  kind of a  libertarian  lean  you know  you're going  to be doing  six out of  ten dollars  in New York  as taxes  that's coming  for you  six out of  ten dollars  in New York 
[01:57:00]  and this is  the stuff  we talk about  I can't  bill people  for that  would they  pay  would they  pay for  this  no  see  we gotta  do it  for free  the man  cow experience  the man  cow experience  he called  that guy  is probably  the biggest  douche  ever to  I wouldn't  even say  probably  trust me  we've dealt  with some  giant douches  there's another  guy that's  actually  you know  wins by  a fucking  huge  fucking 
[01:57:30]  fat belly  that sounds  exactly like  him by the  way  those two  scumbags  are real  close  I really  can't  fucking  stand  the man  cow  he's just  he just  he's full  of shit  he's just  full of  shit  he's a  man of  the people  oh christ  I'm gonna  fucking  just punch  you  and what  he's on  just  AM stations  for the most 
[01:58:00]  part  it's mixed  it's you know  here and there  but a lot  of  he used  to be on  a lot  of really  good FM  stations  and you  know  that all  went away  he wanted  to be on  satellite  satellite  said you  know  go fuck  yourself  so then  he had  to reinvent  himself  and make  believe  all of a sudden  he gave  a shit  about politics  and decide  I'm gonna  try to be  like a  Sean Hannity  guy  and uh  the radio  world is not  really you know  going with it  if you're  if you're on  a bunch of  tiny little  AMs in the  middle of  night  guess what  that's not  really succeeding  no  dummy  dumbass 
[01:58:30]  we got our  own channel  on satellite  radio  that's a lot  bigger than  what man  cow is doing  with a bunch  of tiny  AMs across  America  morning man  house  no it's  the experience  that's the  experience  oh the  man cow  experience  oh thank  you  turd  turd  I hit the  car turd  heading toward  the wall  the fake  wall  the big  fake wall  and the  sound effects  oh my god  is turd  okay  you know  six out of  every ten dollars  is gonna be  taxed on  reinvented

[02:12:00]  why not  second amendment  we'll do that  where's my special  guest  I guess you're gonna  have to wait  after you pee  pee  do you know  who it is  no  I know I'm gonna  be monumentally  disappointed  it's by Steve  Carlisi  I came in on a  Monday  that's great  that's great  that's great  Carson  taking Mondays  off like fucking  Johnny  yeah  I don't get  this place  you could just  tell the boss 
[02:12:30]  I'm gonna have  Mondays off for now  for now on  and you're the main  fucking  hold on  I have to do it  this way  and you're the main  producer of the show  but now you work  a four day work week  he's earned it  who who  has he  yes  Steve has earned it  how do you get away  with working four days  a week if you're  supposedly the main  producer  because of the work  he does  the four days  he's in  just  oh  I mean  and while we're  at  let me tell you  how stupid  Steve is  okay  we set up a very 
[02:13:00]  special guest  for Jimmy  for his birthday  that was yesterday  who's my guest  why did  why did I get  a  a google  google alert  a google alert  thank you  yeah  about the very  special guest  that's gonna be  on the show today  that's why I'm asking  do you know  who the guest is  I honestly do not  because everybody else  does Jimmy  I do not  oh my god  because it was  a google alert  early this morning  or late last night  wouldn't Steve  as executive producer  make sure that  this didn't make 
[02:13:30]  a google alert  anywhere  you would think  if it's a surprise  where's my special  guest  in about a half hour  Jimmy  oh not here yet  no no  I thought  no not here yet  can I have  everyone got the  google alert  right  oh yeah  I've been holding  in gas  how does that  happen  if you're trying  to have a  surprise  what  guess  I'm anxious  no tell me  how it happened  oh my god  you see it right  the special  guest  don't look at  your email  this is what  happens when I  get anxious  I have to get  rid of the  nervousness  Walter Cronkite 
[02:14:00]  is rolling over  in his grave  Jimmy  oh and the  special guest  that was told  it was a surprise  also twittered it  that's good  you think Steve  would go  we want to do  this as a surprise  and you could do  all that after  your interview  smells bad  over here  does it  could someone  ask Steve  why it made  a google alert  for real  does he take  phone calls  on his days  off  no he's  he's off  he doesn't 
[02:14:30]  even take  calls  the executive  producer  doesn't take  calls  in about  the last  half hour  of the show  I'll get  a bunch  of emails  asking for  today's prep  sheet  like that  means anything  for him  really  yeah  Steve places  the post show  call  now it's  to E-Rock  it used to  be to  Danny or  Travis  but he  realized  they weren't  giving him  good information  then he used  to call me  and realize  I had stopped  giving him  good information  and of course  E-Rock  so now he  calls E-Rock  to find out 
[02:15:00]  what audio  was played  on the show  so he can  write the email  great  you know  I tell him  we played  everything  even though  we didn't  so that he  just keeps  removing  everything  off the list  he would  call Sam  because he  would never  call me  for anything  like that  so he  would call  Sam  and I  would try  to feed  fake stories  so what's  new  for tomorrow  and I  would just  try to  make up  stuff  to see  if it  would make  it to  the prep  this sucks  now everyone  knows  Chubby Checker  is coming  in for your  birthday  that guy  was good  come on  baby  it's horrible 
[02:15:30]  I'll tell you  something  that was  one of the  most surreal  moments  that I'll  ever remember  from this  radio show  was watching  Chubby Checker  and Sabra  Cadabra  and he did  sing happy  birthday  Jill brought  him in  from WB11  that was  actually nice  it's fun  to tease  Chubby Checker  but he is  fucking  Chubby Checker  and he sang  the song  and it sounded  just like  the guy  he sang  happy birthday  and then he  didn't want  to sing  the big  do the twist  and then  he wants 
[02:16:00]  10,000  and he's like  we'll have  10,000  to promote  his new CD  and all of a sudden  he's like  I want an attitude  and I'm like  come on baby  yeah  we won that one  like no  Chubby's gonna be  fucking singing today  that was actually  Chubby doesn't leave  here alive  it was fun  then you asked  about his fake hair  which was  it could be the most  uncomfortable moment  I've had in  five years  we had that real fast  we can try to find it  real quick  after the break  I forgot about that  what did I say  just asked  is that hair real  it was something  it was something  like a five year old  would ask  I wanted to 
[02:16:30]  crawl onto the desk  let's get that  for after the break  I forgot about that  was that a year ago  today or is that  two years now  it's a year  one year  yeah  alright we got  a couple little  surprises for you  as long as there's  no cake  I'm trying to eat better  I have to start  filming soon  I'm doing a short movie  with who  I went with  me and Patrice  we're in a film  together  what film  it's called  Furry Something  it's with  Brendan Fraser  and Brooke Shields  I don't have any  scenes with her  I don't think  I try to write  a make out scene 
[02:17:00]  wait you got that  movie officially  yes  congratulations  I don't know  if the listeners  know that  yeah I called up  I thought I bombed  on the audition  Steve's not answering  why he's sleeping  it's his day off  let me get this right  he's a man of leisure  let me get this right  the executive producer  for the show  now has Mondays off  for how long  indefinitely  indefinitely  he said for the  foreseeable future  and the bosses  have no problem  with this  they said they  legally can't do  anything about it  I mean I'm sure  that you know  Bob Bowie probably  takes days off  whenever he feels  like it 
[02:17:30]  probably once a week  yeah yeah  I'm sure  I mean you know  why wouldn't he  and also he decided  a four day work week  for this motherfucker  yeah  he also decided  you know he didn't  feel like doing  the O.P. Anthony  website anymore  show up week  I just love  having him around  are you kidding me  this is  this company  is bizarre  it's bizarre  it's bizarro  everything  everything's backwards  of how it's supposed to be  how do you allow  the executive producer 
[02:18:00]  for one of your  hottest shows  to just take Mondays off  he's the boss  he works hard  sometimes he needs  to rest the brain  so he can come back  on Tuesday  and deliver  like he always does  rest the brain  is the brain resting  when he's here  it's at home  on his pillow  he's in a constant  rest period  I'm a man of leisure  what do you mean  for the foreseeable future  how many  like literally  yeah literally  possibly for a year  does Anthony and I  have this many days  that we never took  no  what do you mean no  Steve would check  but he's off today 
[02:18:30]  so he can't  he's not gonna get  to that today  yeah can we just  indefinitely  take Mondays off  Steve would have  to contact HR  have we collected  enough days off  like these guys  what about our days  exactly  do we have sick  sicky days  well then what day  is Steve gonna take off  yeah  wait Steve  I thought this Monday  thing was for a few  Mondays  like  no no no no  for the foreseeable future  possibly for a year  52 weeks  for real  oh yes 
[02:19:00]  he rocked for real  52  he gets a paid  so our executive  producer is now  working four days a week  well before  on top  on top of deciding  out of nowhere  he doesn't feel like  doing the Opie and Anthony  website anymore  before you  Steve Carlisi  how is he helping  our fucking show  before you get upset  Carlisi  Carlisi  Carlisi  before you get upset  he explained it to me  in very justifiable terms  a couple weeks ago  he said  him and his fiance  we're getting married 
[02:19:30]  he said we're getting  married this weekend  so this Monday  and every Monday  for the foreseeable future  I'm taking off  where's Steve Blatter  for real  he's here usually  no  it's his day off  as soon as Steve  is here  have him come into  the studio  we won't put him  on the air  he's not an air guy  but we gotta talk  this is ridiculous  I thought it was  a few Mondays  no every Monday  does that bother you  I'm stunned 
[02:20:00]  is that Rachel Ray  ah the Prius  I pick one up  if you have the means  I highly recommend  you pick one up  Steve Carlisi's  day off  I'm a man of leisure  and he wonders  why none of his guys  respect him  he's the guy  that's supposed to be  setting the example  and now he has decided 
[02:20:30]  he doesn't need to work  Mondays  for a show  that's really important  to this comedy  for a show that works  their balls off  as much as we fucking  fool around  and joke about it  we work our asses off  he told E-Rock  that's so fucking insulting  to every fucking person  here  he told  he is  Greg Hughes  it's Mr. Conley  how does this work  for a company  I see  he's 
[02:21:00]  day off  I love this  swing batter  swing batter  swing batter  swing batter  shake it up  baby now  twist and shout  it's on the gay parade float  I want to eat  in that restaurant  I'm going to make  a fake reservation  with my new stomach  Chez Louis  the internet king  of New Jersey  Abe Froman 
[02:21:30]  don't you know me  I'm Abe Froman  the internet king  of Jersey  look at the  foundry logos  on everything  he's lost me too  man  Steve has lost me  he told E-Rock  to start taking  Fridays off  that was his advice  to E-Rock  for the last few weeks  my advice to you  is to start drinking  heavily  his advice is  to have the whole staff  taking days off  making our lives  miserable  because I mean 
[02:22:00]  as much as we  beat these guys up  they make our jobs  so much easier  so much easier  and a few of them  are underpaid  so now Steve  has decided  he gets Mondays off  and he's now  suggesting E-Rock  take Fridays off  that puts us  in a real shitty  fucking position  Steve  thanks for caring  about the guys  that brought you up  in this fucking business  I'm really fucking pissed  as much as we're making  I'm astounded  as much as you're  making the jokes  and you should  because we got to  keep the comedy going  it's fucking bullshit  is what it is 
[02:22:30]  the problem is  what do you mean  he suggested you  take Fridays off  that's what I'm getting to  is it because you're  wearing an old  Pittsburgh Pirates jersey  throwback jersey  when we found out  that we had all these days  Steve was the first  to hand in his schedule  saying that  oh I'm taking  every Monday off  and then he's  just been going around  to the staff  make sure you take  your days off  make sure you take  your days off  tells us Friday  at what point  has he thought  that it might  really hurt us three 
[02:23:00]  why are you guys  all taking days off  we haven't yet  he's the only one  why would he be saying  just take days off  because we have  a certain amount  of days built up  how do you guys  have so many fucking days  because I guess  XM never marked it  you know what  we get some nice  vacation now  because we've been  you know doing this  for a long time  and the beauty  of that whole thing  was you guys  got all those days  off too  usually that doesn't  happen you know  so I don't understand  how on top of that  you guys have  even more days off  well that was the  problem at first 
[02:23:30]  when we first got here  it used to be  very informal  don't take it  you know try not  to take too many  sick days  and you can have  off when the  show's off  when we got here  they go  well you guys  can't take off  when the show's off  because you have  less vacation time  so at that point  we all talked to HR  and said exactly  how many sick days  and vacation days  have we accumulated  over the three  four years  we've all been here  and like  Steve has 70 days  or listen  Steve gets  Mondays off  E-Roc gets  Fridays off  I'm grabbing 
[02:24:00]  Wednesdays  I get Wednesday  middle of the week  nice  turns it into  two short  fucking like  work weeks  I want Tuesdays  from 815  to 825  you got it  do the math  only Tuesdays  and what day  you want off  Sunday  yes  how does this  help our show  Janine had a good  one here  I guess because  he's taking  his hands off  and that's how  you executive  reduce  very good  very funny  I want  Thursdays 
[02:24:30]  oh yeah  a family member  has days off  and you give  them crap  you're an asshole  you got that down  I fucking love that  do you have a kiss  for daddy  what's management's  position in this  whole thing  they are  they can't really  do anything about it  they're obviously  when you look at them 
[02:25:00]  they are extremely  frustrated  that this is  the way it's  worked out  and that  should they demand  that like Steve  takes a week off  at a time  so then that's like  you get one week  you know what I mean  every Monday  really fucks up  the rhythm of what  we're trying to do  here  it really does  legally they can't  say you have to do  this with your days  so while a rational  human being would say  oh well since my job  is to make the show  sound better  maybe I won't take  every Monday off  Steve all he sees  is days  so he goes 
[02:25:30]  oh days for me  days for me  like some of us  on the staff  all said  oh well this means  that we can now  take vacation  when the show  takes vacation  and here and there  we could take a day off  we could at least  just sit on them  and feel comfortable  knowing that  if we have an off day  it has to understand  how this fucks us up  when he's gone on Monday  we then realize  how shitty he is  when he's here  so we need him  to actually take  all the time off  if he could have  five days off a week  the show would run  so much better 
[02:26:00]  because we see  like Monday  like today  is great  that he's not here  but now we know  that he's coming in  the rest of the week  and it fucks us up  sucks  yes  just so you know  how productive  his workspace is  we have a garbage can  in his seat  and it's getting  more work done  it's usually there  every day of the week  you could actually  prove that the garbage can  is getting more work  done than Steve  I think it's taking  phone calls  taking phone calls  is it scrolling  my god  you haven't asked  it a question yet  you have to ask  yes  I mean no  oh 
[02:26:30]  intern Evan told me  that one time  Steve  sent him out  to get a padlock  and told him  he had to find  whatever  the nicest one  intern Evan was out  for an hour and a half  trying to find  a padlock  for Steve  and he gets back  and he gives Steve  this padlock  that he spent  an hour and a half  of show time  looking for  and Steve says  great  now I'll be able  to lock my stuff  up in the gym  when I get there  after the show  oh good  oh he's also using  our interns  is that real  intern Evan told me 
[02:27:00]  that yeah  he 100% told me  that  life goes by  pretty fast  if you don't  take vacation time  you'll miss out  hold on it  yes  Rooney  I'll be there  for my check  on Friday  unbelievable  dude  you know what  if you have all  those days  it's good to know  you have them 
[02:27:30]  and every once in a while  you're like  you know what  I'm going to take  a day off  but to actually  make it every Monday  the foreseeable future  and say the foreseeable future  that's ridiculous  like I think  every Monday  here on in  this is what he said  I think if somebody  told Moses  you have 70 days off  we'd probably all be like  that's awesome  and realize  we'll probably never  actually use  70 days  70  Steve  immediately grabbed  his calendar  and marked  70 days  that he used  70 Mondays 
[02:28:00]  dude  that's it  before the next  brilliance of  comedy  I just gotta say  it's  it's  he's  it's a big  fuck you to me  Aunt Jimmy  Danny  E-Roc  Sam  Travis  and remember  who you're dealing with  Steve C  he's just doing  this to everybody  he really is  hey he's just  taking his days  it's the company days  he's gonna take them  they can't take it away 
[02:28:30]  Sam  yeah  and he wonders why  none of these guys  respect him  it's  you know  you don't have  just look in the mirror  Steve  and then you  you can answer  your own question  I don't like to  I don't understand  these guys don't  listen to me  because they're  hey  I tell you  I get no respect  my dog  and Vinnie  Boombats  he's barely  breaking even  on his web page  and this is like  free money  I mean he told me  barely breaking even  he said free money  yeah  this is money  it's like  it's costing him 
[02:29:00]  money  if he doesn't  take the days  yeah I'll tell you  free money  holy mother  of fuck  you know  gonna go stare  at a Monet  it's Steve  Carlisi's  day off  making me  so gay  there he is 
[02:29:30]  god damn man  yes  he just hopes  you guys  don't see him  while he's  in the parade  John Kishane  he'll steal  a taxi  from us  yeah  Anthony  will look over  and say  is that  Steve  Steve  what  yes  look I'm  in the float  with Scandinavian  women  without you  without you  there's Steve 
[02:30:00]  in his vest  yes  it's my vest  he's a fan  of that pattern  anyway  yes  leopard print  god damn  how do you  get away  with it  how do you  get away  with it  god bless you  I keep it  funny  because I'm  like  I'm out of  my mind  it's ridiculous  I don't get it  you know how  god bless you  for the comedy  you know how pissed  he'd be  if it turns out  now that they  go to him  and go  you can't  do this  he will be  every Monday  he will just be  crankier than  he always is  I will tell you 
[02:30:30]  something  I believe  Steve C  will try to  sue the company  if they tell  he can't  take Mondays  off  that's something  I think  I believe  that he will  try to sue  the company  you can speak  with my attorney  he's becoming  a hindrance  is what he is  yes  he is a hindrance  becoming  well I'm trying  to be nice  about it  he has been  for a while  all right  he has  and this is  it's ridiculous  I mean these guys  not only are here  every fucking day  I get emails  and phone calls  from these guys  I'm still at work  I'm like what  I already took  a three hour nap  and I went  on a bike ride  and this guy 
[02:31:00]  is you know  jumping at the  opportunity to work  less  well he does  give us the  assignments  before he leaves  for the day  so I mean  we at least  know at the least  at least that's good  Sam you laugh  in his face  at this point  I hope  oh yes  I know Danny  has for a long time  and I hope  you're at that level  too  I mean  you're not going  nowhere  Danny's been  vindicated  for every  doubt  that maybe  he was wrong  no problem  we need one  I'll protect you 
[02:31:30]  thanks  do you kiss  his ass  a little bit  I can work  with him  I don't kiss  his ass  a little bit  you do laugh  at him now  though  oh yeah  I mean  I'm cordial  enough  I'm not  at the Danny  level  where I just  spit in his  face basically  metaphorically  speaking  of course  where's Travis  besides being  a sarcastic  douche  how do you  handle Steve  at this point  very sarcastically  yeah Travis 
[02:32:00]  is in the Danny  camp  Steve doesn't  really talk  to Travis  either  yeah  that's good  like every  Monday  he'll ask me  to send  him the prep  sheet  that I make  in the morning  and somehow  every Monday  I forget to do  it until the  afternoon  because I don't  see why he  needs it  if he's  sitting at  home  and not  answering his  phone  Travis told  me this  morning  see that's  what pisses  me off  the most  and we'll  go back  to the  jokes  is the  fact  alright  so  he's in  a position  where he  knows he's  got the  company by  the balls  and he's  taking every  Monday  off  but he's 
[02:32:30]  on Mondays  to do a  quick little  hey Steve  where's this  what's going  on with this  type thing  so you'd  think the  give Steve  the recap  of what  happened on  the show  today is  only when  he's off  but every  day after  the show  he asks  one of us  he goes  through the  prep sheet  and says  do we play  this  do we play  this  do we play  this  Iraq told  me that  he was  sitting in  studio  one time  when Danny  was sick  in studio  with you  guys  and he  comes out  of the  studio  after the 
[02:33:00]  show  and says  hey Iraq  what audio  did we play  today  and Iraq  goes  you were  not answering  phones  you were  not checking  email  you were  sitting in  studio  with them  oh my god  and what kind  of assignments  he gives you  guys  try calling him  see if you get  him on the  phone  Travis  we've called  him about  50 times  okay  with him  not answering  he knows  we're calling  what a  fucking  dick  it's his  day off  yeah but  he  was he  sleeping in  no he's  checking out  a ball game  he's not even  supposed to be  here today  he never 
[02:33:30]  bothered  telling  remember we  were talking  about yesterday  wrong movie  dickhead  what movie did  Travis reference  clerks  nobody was  talking about  clerks  he went to  work in  clerks  saying I'm not  even supposed  to be here  means yeah  he went to  work  so your whole  fucking thing  doesn't even  work  you stink 
[02:34:00]  if Steve  had come in  on Sunday  it would be  like clerks  if he worked  six days  he works  four days  though  it's more  like Ferris  from clerks  ever  he finally  got a little  courage to  pot it up  and say it  on the air  and he  crashed and  burned on  his first  sortie  well you know  we were  talking yesterday  yeah I figured  you'd fucking  throw one out  there  we should just  put a fucking  mute on that  microphone  there's no need  for it  why don't you  take today  off  I can't 
[02:34:30]  Steve already  did  I want to  hear about  the assignments  that Steve  gives these  guys every  day  here's the  problem  the only  thing Steve  ever tells  us to do  is something  that somebody  else obviously  told him to  tell us to  do  except he's  a terrible  communicator  and what  happens is  very useful  information  gets filtered  out  before it  hits us  Steve is the  useful information  filter  and so we  have to try  to figure out  who told  Steve to  tell us  to do  that  and then  go to  them  and get 
[02:35:00]  the assignment  again  right  like for  instance  if Rob  Cross were to  say hey  Steve have  the guys  do this  it's usually  something that  needs to get  done in a  legitimate  request  but Steve  asks Eric  me or  whoever to  do it  and Eric  and me  look at  him like  what are you  talking about  like we  can't even  it doesn't  make sense  what he's  asking us  to do  so then we  go to  Rob Cross  and say hey  did you  want us  to do  this  and Rob  no  here is  what  it all  makes sense  yes  ah  I gotcha  which is why 
[02:35:30]  the show runs  smoothly on  Mondays  oh yeah  there's no  question about  it  we've been  asked by  other series  employees  well who  is Steve's  fill-in  when he's  gone  like who  is the  guy in  charge  the garbage  pail  who's the  guy in  charge  Tuesday  through  Friday  it's the  same  it runs  the same  it runs  the same  whether it's  you or not  that's good  and then he  gives us a  big fuck  you  that's  great  Steve  thanks  for everything 
[02:36:00]  we did  for you  over the  years  fuck  you  let's go  to the  break  with the  FU line  and I think  Jimmy's guest  will be here  soon  that was  blown  because  they made  a google  surprise  I honestly  didn't cost  it because  I don't  know  I didn't  check google  alert  I would  tell you  I would  love to  blow it  but I  just  don't  know  that was  a year ago  with the  Chubby Checker  Sabra Kadabra  I was amazed 
[02:36:30]  Sabra Kadabra  learned the  song so fast  because if  you remember  they were  like  yeah  we'll give  it a shot  because Chubby  needed a band  to sing that  song for  Jimmy's birthday  last year  it's one of  those songs  that I think  if you're in  a band  and can't  play it  you best  fucking  leave your  band  that proves  I don't  know shit  about bands  just a  blues riff  you know  it's like  when Marty  McFly got  up there  with Marvin  Berry's  band  yeah  blues riff  and beat  try to keep  up  watch me  for the  changes 
[02:37:00]  try to  keep up  very easy  I missed  that live  audience  Marvin  Berry  yeah we  got it  I missed  the live  audience  I know  man  it's kind  of funny  you hear  that energy  yeah  hear that  energy  we gotta  figure that  out  let this  play  near near  near near  near near  near  near near  near  near  near  near  near  a lot  of people  saying they  missed the  live audience  wow  yeah  coming in  hanging out  near near 
[02:37:30]  near  what were we  doing  trying to move  on  fuck I had  something I can't  remember  oh the gun  thing with Chuck  Schumer  god I hate  this Chuck  Schumer  Chuck Schumer  is a douche  he's a  blowhard  leave people  alone  he's  gerrymandering  he just  kissing ass  and making  other people's  lives miserable  so what is he  what is he  the junior  senator  is he a  senator  what is he 
[02:38:00]  in New York  now I  apparently  he's like  you know  the guy  he's the  guy now  that Hillary  is fucking  not part  of it  anymore  she's  secretary  of something  secretary  of obscurity  right  Obama goes  around the  world  he loves  that Air  Force One  oh does  he love  it  guy's never  in the  White House  the fucking  guy's traveling  everywhere  he's making  friends  he loves  he's patching  up some  problems  he loves  that plane  holy shit  does he love  flying around  in that thing  isn't he into 
[02:38:30]  that whole  environment thing  yeah  the green  movement  yeah  4747 engines  throw off a  little bit of  almost as much  power as my  house over the  weekend  holy shit  I forgot  that  Thursday  when I had  the car show  thing  I forgot  I had  one of my  pool  a little  toasty  so I put  the heater  on and  forgot  that I was  staying in  the city  to turn  it down  so it was  on the  entire day  and night  on Thursday  pretty high 
[02:39:00]  so I got  back Friday  and realized  97 degrees  is a little  warm for a  pool  wow  not just  the jacuzzi  the entire  pool was  97 degrees  so I shut  the heater  off and  then by  Saturday  when everyone  came over  it was  down to  a nice  refreshing  92 degrees  but I'll  tell you  something  it was  cool as  shit  wasn't it  good  it was  like it  felt great  you could  walk right  in without  your balls  going  it's cold  but you gotta  be running  out of  money  are you 
[02:39:30]  dealing drugs  on the side  where are you  getting this  money from  the electric  bill is  ridiculous  ridiculous  I think  this one  was  I think  this month  was $1600  last month  was $1300  so it's  only going  up  going up  and it  is that  electric  heater  is  wowie  kazowie  but you  know  something  what are  you gonna  do  the fuck  you gonna  do  croak  with it  what are  you gonna  do  fucking  not have  fun  so yeah 
[02:40:00]  it was  very good  and it  was like  an 80  degree  day  I guess  on Saturday  here in  New York  in the  low 80s  and when  you got  out of  the pool  you went  like  oh it's  cool out  it's a little  reversal  it felt  refreshing  when you  left the  pool  that's  weird  but then  what was  I going  oh yeah  stupid  Chuck  Schumer  apparently  the Republicans  very sneaky  as sneaky  as the  Democrats  can be  kind of  snuck in  this bill  in another 
[02:40:30]  bill  they tend  to do  that  now  the Democrats  do it  you know  that just  doesn't make  sense  I know  why is it  the thing  they do  it's like  last minute  they sneak  things in  and then  they sneak  two foods  at you  one you  really enjoy  and the other  one you're  like I would  never  fucking eat  this food  so why  are they  in the  same  fucking  bill  well  now it  is  because we  snuck  that in  who started  that and  why does  it continue  to this  day  it doesn't  make any  sense  I don't  know how  it's legal  a lot  of times  the Democrats  do it  and the 
[02:41:00]  Republicans  don't read  the fucking  thing  so it gets  signed into  law  that's always  good  to start  reading it  well apparently  the Democrats  were reading  bastards  because Chuck  Schumer's now  all mad  you hear what  you just said  these guys  are supposed  to be looking  out for us  and they're  just signing  shit  they don't  even know  what it is  both sides  do that  it's true  yeah they do  they really  do  so this  Republican  I believe  from Wyoming  tried to  slip in this  little thing  and he slipped  it in  for the bill  where 
[02:41:30]  if you  are a  legal  registered  licensed  gun owner  handgun owner  from any  state in  the United  States of  America  you should  be able  to come  into another  state  with that  license  so New  York  let's  say  you're  from  another  state  you should  be able  to come  into New  York  and be able  to carry  a concealed  pistol  on you  if you're  a licensed  person  from another  state  some states 
[02:42:00]  do that  like I could  take my New  York license  and use it  in like  Tennessee  you're just  going to  Tennessee  and you're  allowed  but I  cannot  take it  to any  bordering states  of New  York  so it  doesn't matter  unless I'm  flying  which I  think  they frown  on that  unless you  want to  spend two  hours with  the transit  police  explaining  why you  have your  gun  where you're  taking it  pack it  separate  this that  you can  actually do  that  but it's  a huge  pain in the  ass  it's so  difficult  to go  state to  state 
[02:42:30]  with a  legal gun  legal I'm  saying  I'm not  talking about  illegal guns  and people  buy and  transfer over  the state  and then  they're used  in crimes  and people  go oh  take  everyone's  gun  away  don't  blow me  I'm  talking  about  legal guns  people that  own them  legally  that want  to defend  themselves  perhaps when  they go  to another  state  you are not  allowed  and Chuck  Schumer said  this is  one of the  worst things  he's ever  seen  happen  if this  was to  happen  it would be  one of the  worst things  he's ever  seen  why 
[02:43:00]  to see  law-abiding  licensed  gun owners  actually being  able to  protect  themselves  would be  awful  wouldn't  it Chuck  because he's  thinking  again like  the fucking  liberal  douchebags  think that  this means  that more  criminals are  going to  get guns  you know  what  they already  got them  they already  have  illegal guns  but how do  they get  the guns  if we  get them  illegally  they go  to states  that have  very lenient  gun laws  gun laws  where they  don't do  background checks  and stuff like  that  I don't have 
[02:43:30]  a problem  with checking  someone's  background  and running  them through  the FBI  to see if  they have  any crimes  or any  mental  incapacities  which  they  don't have  the responsibility  to own a gun  Jim where  are you on  this  I am  in the  middle  I think  that the  NRA goes  way too  far  but  I do  think  that  illegal  gun owners  are very  rarely the  problem  you do 
[02:44:00]  get cases  of it  where guys  who own  guns  snap  and I  think  look  the bottom  line  is  the  society's  right  to be  protected  over being  fucking  machine gun  is more  important  than some  guys  right  to have  toys  but  I  think  that  legal  gun owners  should have  the right  to protect  themselves  and have  a gun  in their  home  and I  think  as citizens  we should  have that  right  I  think  we should  also  have  the right  like  this  because  it  is  the  United  States  Constitution  where  the  Second  Amendment  is  written  in  why  state  by state  can they 
[02:44:30]  then tell  you  you can  exercise  your  Second  Amendment  right  in this  state  but not  in this  one  or you  have to  jump  through  this  hoop  to do  this  one  it's  it's  you know  you can  take  your  driver's  license  and drive  through  every  state  in the  union  with a  New York  driver's  license  they're  not  going to  stop  you  in  Oklahoma  and go  but this  is a  New York  license  you can  do  that  and  driving  is a  privilege  there is  not a  constitutional  right  that says  you have  the right  to drive  and driving 
[02:45:00]  more dangerous  than owning  a gun  apparently  more people  die from  them  but  I'm just  saying  this is  a privilege  to drive  a car  yet your  driver's  license  allows you  passage  in every  state  now your  constitutional  right  to bear  arms  is restricted  state  by state  so Chuck  Schumer  again  just  sticking  his fat  fucking  nose  into  our  rights  and  you know  again  doesn't  want  us  to  exercise 
[02:45:30]  our  second  amendment  right  to be  able  to  bear  arms  and  legally  carry  a gun  and protect  yourself  and your  loved ones  if you're  coming into  New York  state  from another  state  that you  are licensed  in  are we  really free  in America  Anthony  no  no  I don't  think so  either  and we're  getting more  unfree  every day  I read  this thing  today  in the  editorial  section  about  Obama's  health  care  plan  which  was  it was  amazing  a guy  owns a  small  company  he's  going to  be  they're 
[02:46:00]  going to  make him  pay for  all this  health care  if he  doesn't  pay for  health care  they're  going to  charge  companies  thousands  of dollars  in penalties  for not  paying for  their  employees  health care  this guy  figured it  out  he goes  I have  so many  employees  I pay  them this  much money  for health  care  he goes  it's  in my  best  interest  now  under  this  Obama  plan  to  pull  their  health  insurance  and pay  the penalty  it'll be  cheaper  than what  he wants  me to  pay them  for health 
[02:46:30]  insurance  so now  you gotta think  Obama knows  that people  are gonna  pick that  option  so he's  gotta figure  out a way  around that  no  you know  something  probably  they didn't  have that  figured out  until someone  brought it up  and now  they're not  that small  now they're  like oh  what do we  do  so let's  triple  the penalties  it's  everything's  nationalized  now look  we got a  fucking  automotive  company run  by the  government  the health  care  wants to  be run  by the  government  the banks  mortgage  companies  run by  the  government  we are  so much  more  socialist 
[02:47:00]  bordering  on  communists  than  Russia  is now  never  thought  I'd  see  that  day  and the  people  that  were  saying  that  Obama  and  his  people  aren't  socialist  look  look what's  happening  this is  socialism  I have a  question though  this is  not even  an argument  with you  I just  don't know  the answer  what was  he  and I'm  not saying  Obama  was  completely  right  but  this is  a worldwide  problem  with the  banks  collapsing  this isn't  just the  US  because the  government's  bailing them  out  how should 
[02:47:30]  he have  handled it  that wouldn't  have made  it a socialist  thing  where you're  not just  giving these  companies money  who are then  turning around  and just  paying out  their executives  let's be  honest  the government  control I think  came in  because these  scumbags  were proving  that if you  just gave them  money on their  honor  they were going  to continue  to give giant  bonuses  and then come  back and ask  for more  because they're  scumbags  so where is the  government's job to go  alright we'll give you  money  we're going to step  in and make sure  you don't fuck  people and just  give it out big  bonuses again 
[02:48:00]  like I don't know  what's the proper  answer there  the most dangerous  thing is for the  government to step  into the private  sector like this  and start financing  shit  it's very dangerous  I don't know if  the right idea was  for them to jump  in and bail them  out at all  I think the right  idea might have  been for General  Motors to try  to make a deal  with another  company in another  country or whatever  the fuck they had  to do to get  themselves out of  trouble and keep  moving but you know  something if they 
[02:48:30]  couldn't make it  work then they'd go  to the wayside like  fucking gimbals did  and like fucking  other other stores  and companies did  a lot of people  going to be out of  a job  can I ask you this  though I mean isn't  that a big risk to  take to have like the  car makers fold  under like a  huge risk to take  but you know  something it only  fosters more  competition and more  technology if  something goes on  we've never had  something go under  that hasn't then  been taken up by  something that kind 
[02:49:00]  of works better  that we get better  jobs from  and I get all that  I get that much  but wouldn't that  mean the collapse  of Detroit as a  city and can  Detroit's dead  Detroit is dead  or alright how  about most of the  state and can we  handle that  no I'm just asking  and can we handle  that as a country  we have to because  that's what's  happening our auto  industry is dead  it's gone  so this is just  like it's  so this is just  a temporary  solution  it's a socialist  band-aid 
[02:49:30]  socialism doesn't  work look what  happened in Russia  come on  they did the same  thing it might be a  band-aid for a while  but it doesn't work  for the long term  the government  cannot be in the  private sector  financially without  it costing the  citizens huge  amounts of money  because this  government money  is our money  it's the people's  fucking money  they didn't just  pull it out  their ass  they're taxing  the shit out  of us now  and it might 
[02:50:00]  have been a  better idea  just to let  this play out  in the financial  sector and not  get the government  involved like they  fucking got involved  they're in so deep  now they are  running things  and only want to  run more by the  way this healthcare  thing dude is  fucked  and that's where I  have to ask you  there's somebody  that actually wants  to debate you on  the health thing  the healthcare  thing  are you willing  to do it  Dr. Steve  I'll tell you  in a sec here  hold on  I got it  I mean I got  it from my 
[02:50:30]  you know  wheeze  so you know  you know where  wheeze is  oh Jesus Christ  he's begging me  to have  ultra lib  he's begging me  to have you  talk to  fuck where is  it  killer guest  Wednesday  Dr. Aaron  Carroll  yeah  he wants to  come in  and debate  you on  the healthcare  thing  I don't  give a shit  I'll talk  to anybody  it'll be  intense  good  should we  book it  8 a.m.  Wednesday 
[02:51:00]  I'll study  8 a.m.  Wednesday  yeah why not  Dr. Aaron  Carroll  I guess he'll  he thinks he  could turn you  around in the  whole healthcare  thing  yeah he's  gonna turn me  right around  you wanna turn  me around  turn me around  how about  I'll come to  your house  and take  your money  and we'll  turn me around  that way  I'm tired of  paying for  people  I'm really  tired of  paying for  fucking  people  I am  I've had  it  oh our  special guest  and poor 
[02:51:30]  Jay Oakerson  we gotta bring  Jay in too  so we'll book  this guy for  Wednesday  yeah  is that cool  I'd love to  fucking go off  on him  because I don't  want to like  blindside you  with the guy  it ain't blindsiding  me  alright so we'll  have him in on  Wednesday at 8  let him come in  and we'll have  some fun  because he  I guess he's  tried to call  a show many  times to  debate you  but he  can't get  through  good  because we're  a very popular  radio show  of course  and he doesn't  have the hotlines  that's fine  a doctor wants  the government  to step in  and subsidize  healthcare  that's a surprise  that's great 
[02:52:00]  why wouldn't  a doctor want  that  alright who  are we bringing  in  let's bring in  Jay real quick  just to sit him  down so he's  at least part  alright Jay  how much money  you get for  handing out  references  yes  how much money  you get for  handing out  references  doctor  why can't  if I have a  fucking ear  rake  why can't  I go to  an ear  doctor  why do I  have to go  to a general  practitioner  first  pay that  motherfucker  so he  can send  me to  an ear  doctor  don't even  give me  shit  I'm gonna  guess  that's  insurance  companies  because  probably the 
[02:52:30]  scumbag  insurance  companies  we all deal  with that  shit  you're right  it is  but guess  how much  better it's  going to be  when it's  the government  instead of  insurance  companies  stop  more red  tape  than  fucking  you see  the government  pays for  stuff  the waste  the 18  people that  could do  one person's  job  happened  we were  having fun  today  now you're  mad and  now I'm  happy  I'm happy  I'm not  mad  it's your  almost  birthday  I'm impassioned  now where  should Jay  sit  because I  don't 
[02:53:00]  I don't want  Jay interrupting  my special  guest  whoever it  is  where do  you want  your special  guest  I love  I  depend on  who my  special guest  is  I guess  they should  probably be  right there  next to me  I think  you  someone pointed  out by the  way in the  videos  how weird  it is  when you  have a  guest  sitting  literally  three feet  from you  Jimmy  and you're  yelling and  screaming  at him  that's  gotta be  so awkward  for Jimmy  hi Jay  what's up  Jay  good to see  you  happy birthday  I'm told  how come  when I  listen  on the  radio  you guys 
[02:53:30]  are like  jamming  wiffle ball  bats  and girl  snatches  now it's  all political  somehow  not all  political  we did  talk about  hanging  duty  through a  hole in  the ceiling  fair enough  we were  talking about  how stupid  fish were  how lame  fish are  we run  the gamut  you guys  keep it  diverse  I like it  we had a  tribute to  Walter Cronkite  today  really  and we  talked about  Tom Watson  basically shitting  his pants  on the 18th  hole  that old  fucking  codger  can fucking  sink a  10 foot 
[02:54:00]  pot  where's  my guest  you want  to know  yes  it's me  I thought  it might  be you  Jay  I wouldn't  be surprised  you really  don't know  who the  special guest  is  everybody  knows  except you  because we  all got  the google  alert  ladies and  gentlemen  Jimmy's  special guest  that's the way  he is with  most things  oh shit  he's freely  in the house  oh shit  wow  happy birthday  Jimmy  fucking  ace  freely  you didn't  know  Jimmy  no

[02:55:00]  parents  look what we've  done for him  well that's why  we were pissed  when it made  the google  alert  because we're  like this  we wanted to  surprise Jimmy  for once  but something  real  I am  completely  fucking  we had chubby  checker last  year  I mean  oh chubby's  a friend of  mine  but this is  a big step  up in Jimmy's  world  trust me  a major step  up  if they just  sent your  shoes in  I would have  been happier  with them  than chubby  checker  who's great  but  if yes  maybe you  guys could  switch shoes  you know  dude I'm so  happy you're  fucking here  ace has got  a new CD  coming out  in October  oh I'm wearing  a kiss shirt 
[02:55:30]  this was not  planned  it was probably  a bootleg  too  Gene will sue  me  yeah  that'll happen  there you go  Jimmy  I'm so happy  I'm really happy  you're here  how old are you  today Jimmy  fucking 41  41  you're a little  you're a young  shaver  it's depressing  it's really  depressing  I thought you  were just 40  this year  no I'm 41  oh look at you  and I've been  I've been a fan  I'm sure you'll be  here this all the time  I've been a fan  since I am literally  since probably 1975  I've been a fan  since like fuck  I was 7 years old  I'm so fucking 
[02:56:00]  happy  wow  you were 7 years  old when you  were just going  ace  yeah yeah  it was like  right around  fucking  76 when  Kiss Alive  came out  we can ask him  about the movie  we were just  checking out  recently  oh we've been  watching  non-stop  Kiss  and what is  the Phantom of the Park  I was just in  Magic Mountain  about two weeks  ago  I went on  roller coasters  it was great  you enjoyed it  really  it was back  in the location  it brought back  a lot of memories  you know  because you know  on the down time  when we were  filming that movie  I had a moped 
[02:56:30]  and you know  they closed the park  and I used to just  like zoom around  all you know  all the roads  inside Magic Mountain  it was up time  watching that  yeah it's a good  comedy you know  that's why I look  at it as like  a comedy  oh okay  oh comedy  all right  now I can see  now I understand  do they overdub  Peter's dialogue  because he didn't  like want to do  it in post  and they just  kind of put  another actor's  voice over him  you know  they do all sorts  of crazy things  after you finish  a film  and a lot of  times you have  no control over it  but I think 
[02:57:00]  some of Peter's  lines didn't  come out correctly  or it wasn't  loud enough  or you know  for whatever the  reason  our favorite part  is we've been  watching Gene  because there's a  scene where Gene  runs over the  and he knocks  over the concession  stand  but you can see  him kind of  trip  as he goes  as he kind of  goes so we got  to show A$AP  part if you ever  watch him  because he kind  of breaks  through he's like  he breaks through  it in his little  boots he just  kind of half  trips  and he stumbles  a little bit  you know this  scene right here  at the pool  I actually held 
[02:57:30]  up production for  about 45 minutes  minimum we had  to do 25 takes  because the guy  that walks out  over to us  with a cop  he fell  and cut his hand  but the way he  did it  it was just so  hysterical  every time I saw  his face  after he fell  I couldn't  stop laughing  so we went  through about  27 takes  and finally  we got it  you became  after a while  too  it was like  at first  when I first  started liking  Kiss  I love Gene 
[02:58:00]  and Paul  and then  it was like  you became  my favorite  because you  seem like  the one guy  with the  really fuck  you to all  of this  kind of  attitude  in the band  not fuck  you to the  other guys  but like  just you know  obviously your  very famous  interview where  Gene and Paul  are getting  annoyed  where you're  fucking laughing  the Tom  Snyder interview  were they  really annoyed  at you?  I think they  were more annoyed  that I was  drunk most of  the time  not anymore  thank god  yeah  we heard  those stories  well you know  I mean  it's 
[02:58:30]  you know what  one of the  funniest things  that a lot  of people  don't know  about this  film  is that  my stunt  double  was black  really  yeah  but he was  a great guy  and he actually  did the best  flips  I mean you know  that scene we had  when we were  fighting those  white monkeys  you know  those weird  looking things  that were crawling  on the  roller coaster  did it hold up  your production  that the stunt  double was late  every day  well they just  had to put  white  you know  I mean 
[02:59:00]  white makeup  on his hands  light flesh  on his  on his hands  because you know  everything else  was covered  and the face  was you know  yeah he had  the face makeup  on  the clown white  you know  here's the  jean scene  we're trying to  show Ace the  jean scene  where he walks  through  he's beating  up all the  people  now one cop  was in 48  hours  and it's odd  that they're not  playing kiss  music behind  this  yeah  it's like  some  I got this  actually the new  version on  kissology 3  they actually  Paul and Gene  dropped in  different music  oh they did  in the original  film 
[02:59:30]  here's Gene  getting ready  to walk  through  watch him  kind of trip  at the very  end  he just  kind of  stumbles  I hate to  burst your  bubble  but that's  not Gene  oh that's  not him  oh no  I swear to  god  that's his  stunt double  he wanted to  do it but  they wouldn't  let him do  it for  insurance  insurance  right  yeah  you know  how that works  his stunt double  was an  Asian man  a small  Asian  gentleman  god damn  it  because I  saw  oh yeah  we did the  roast  Gene  and there's  a scene 
[03:00:00]  where Gene  gets up  and he stands  and he was  wearing a suit  and his boots  and he stood  up and he  tripped and he  fell on his  face on the  stage  and I howled  of course  and they  actually cut it  and re-shot it  where he didn't  fall  during the roast  oh yeah  he had to get up  and take flowers  from somebody  and he fucking  face planted  and I'm like  they should have  left that  it was  fantastic  yeah it was  great  but they cut it  I think  and they  made it look  like he got up  I was supposed  to do that  but the rest  of the guy  Paul and Peter  decided to bow  out  so I felt 
[03:00:30]  weird going  without the rest  of the band  yeah I was  kind of hoping  you guys  would be there  that would have  been the highlight  did they not  want to do it  because they're  pissed at him  I don't know  I mean I was  really busy  finishing up  my CD  and I think  Paul had a  project  you know  and Peter  I think Peter  was working  on a CD  at the same  time also  so I mean  how do you  get where  so many  other bands  like can  kind of  hold it  together  over the  years  but Kiss  has been  one of  these  bands  that  you've only  heard stories  of like  arguments  and stuff  over the years  between you guys  and then some  people getting  thrown out  new guys 
[03:01:00]  coming in  and then back  together again  it's always been  this drama  with Kiss  well you know  it makes a good  story  I mean obviously  all the arguing  is definitely  exaggerated  you know  most of the time  we got along  most of the time  mostly exaggerated  somehow  I don't buy that  but okay  it was you know  I got a picture  I went and saw  Kiss a few years ago  and it was  it was three of the guys  it was an ace  and it was just  it made me bomb 
[03:01:30]  because Tommy Thayer  he's a good player  but it's like  it's like  it's nice  yeah yeah  it's like I just  wanted to get a photo  with you and kind of  tape it over where  he is in the  fucking photo  it's not the same  well those situations  kind of like  you know  you don't even  want to know  what they're doing  and shit like that  I don't have much  attention to what  they're doing lately  I mean  you know  yeah  the thing that  bothers me the most  is when I go on  YouTube and I read  the fans comments  and they seem really  upset about Tommy  being in my makeup  you know  originally you know  I just let it go  because you know  I was doing other 
[03:02:00]  things  but you know  it bothers me  that it bothers  the fans a lot  so but you know  it is what it is  they should give  his own identity  let him do his thing  but they shouldn't  put him  it's like we're not  fooled into thinking  that it's ace  and this is a new  thing right  with having ace's  makeup now too  I think so  they were using  their own different  guys  they did have  a different makeup  when the guys  came in to replace  the main members  right  does he try to  imitate your  guitar movements  and stage movements  and stuff like that  yeah I mean  actually I saw  something on YouTube  and he's trying to 
[03:02:30]  kind of stumble  like I did  because I was  drunk most of the  time in those days  and I thought  that was kind of  funny but  wow look at that  subtle move he did  there he's got  his staggered  down you know  his shoulders  on as broad  as mine though  yeah it's kind  of weird like  it's like I don't  want to watch  Tommy Thayer  trying to do  like that little  kind of fallback  I love the fact  that when you sing  this is my favorite  Ace Freely thing  it always looks  like you're not  going to make it  to the mic  in time to sing  that's my favorite  it's like he's  going to miss it  there's no way  and then all of a  sudden your mouth  is on it  I'm like Jesus Christ 
[03:03:00]  it's like you stay  as far away from  the mic as possible  until the exact moment  to sing it  and then you're right  there I love that  it's intense  watching you work  I saw you at the  Hard Rock  for Eddie Trunk  when he kind of  hosted your Hard Rock  how long ago was that  a year ago  was that Halloween  that was like the  first time I performed  in five years  yeah it was fucking  great man  and the new CD  is it September 15th  I heard it was October  it's September 15th  the Hard Rock show  no no no 
[03:03:30]  your new CD  Anomaly  oh September 15th  ok September 15th  first solo album  out in like  20 years  oh 20 years  which I'm actually  very psyched  because people like  Ace is so sick  of being asked  when is the CD  coming out  when is he going  to put out  some new material  and then here it is  do you have any of  any of it  with you at all  no  fuck  we would have  played something  yeah I would love  to hear some of that  I saw the commercial  for it  I watched a commercial  on YouTube  where you're right  up on a motorcycle  and you're talking  yeah we just shot  that about two weeks  ago  yeah it was kind of  like a low budget  kind of a cool shoot  and then you just 
[03:04:00]  take off  you throw them CDs  I was like they're so  lucky to stand there  at Ace throw them CDs  so if you shoot  any more commercials  I'd be happy to bring  my horrible acting  into it for free  you ever watch  any of Gene's show  and realize  how much  of a put on  that is  between the real  Gene's  I haven't watched  it recently  I watched it  a couple years ago  yeah  I thought it was  funny as shit  man  really  yeah  do you think  it portrayed him  in an accurate light  yeah pretty much  I mean Gene  can be a really  funny guy 
[03:04:30]  but you know  he can huh  it's so incongruous  it's so incongruous  to his stage persona  you know  first he's the monster  and then he's  this bumbling  silly guy  and then in interviews  he's talking like  a professor  yeah yeah  but those are the  different sides of Gene  you know  you either love it  or you hate it  you know  it is what it is  I tend to hate it  okay  you're entitled to that  this is America  but Ant's a big fan  of Gene  not a big Gene  not a big Gene fan  but whatever  we might have had a  problem with Gene  or Ant might have 
[03:05:00]  a little misunderstanding  you know  nothing  I think he tried  to dry hump  my chick  against the wall  that sounds like Gene  whatever  yeah yeah  you know  he's tried to do mine too  that's great  so and you get sick  of people asking you  about the band  going out again  I'm sure you're  probably happy  just to be doing  your own thing  and your own  you know  your own solo career  you gotta be happy  just doing your own thing  I'm happiest  when I'm in control  of my destiny  you know  I produced this record  it's taken forever  but I'm real happy  with the end result 
[03:05:30]  and I think  everybody else  will be also  did it get frustrating  after a while  if you had a vision  because of the solo albums  yours was the best  and it was commonly  thought of  even back when  the four solo records  came out  that yours was  by far the best  I mean I think  they said Paul's  might have been  a second best  and then Gene  and Peter  were not quite as good  but yours was  by far the best  and it seemed like  wow you really  seemed to do well  when you're not  having somebody else  kind of breathe  down your neck  and tell you  what to do creatively  well you know  those guys  know how to push  my buttons  and they're perfectionists  and you know  they work differently 
[03:06:00]  than I do  you know  if I don't get a take  in three or four  three or four shots  you know  I take a break  you know  but you know  they do 25 takes  of the same song  and I'm like  what happened  to all the spontaneity  it's gone  even if you get it right  it ain't right  you know  so  that's kind of  a different way  that we work  but  you know  this new album  I think  is the closest  to the first solo album  of anything  I've put out  since that record  you know  what's cool too  watching you  because when Ace  goes out solo  it's like  you don't deny 
[03:06:30]  the Kiss past  it's like  you have a guy  with you  who will sing  some of the songs  like Love Gun  and do some  of the Kiss ones  and you do  your Kiss classics  Scotty Coogan  yeah  he's great  he's really great  I mean  he really sings great  so it's like  you don't feel  uncomfortable  watching the old  Kiss songs  get played  it's like  you kind of  want to see them  and then you do  your own  solo stuff  it's a great  live solo show  yeah  I mean  Bill O'Coin  was at the  House of Blues  in LA  and he came  back at the show  and was like  hugging me  his nickname  for me  is Ace-a-fur  and he just 
[03:07:00]  thought it was  the greatest  thing he's seen  in a long time  and I guess  I did justice  to the old  Kiss songs  oh yeah  Jimmy could you  tell them  your childhood  fantasy  have you ever  oh boy  Ace you gotta  hear this one  it's terrific  I'm an odd guy  and when I was a  kid my first  fantasies  they were not  sexual  but I would  fantasize  that when I  was a boy  that Kiss  would come to  my apartment  in their makeup  and their costumes  and that they  would beat me up  and then throw  me down the stairs  and then while  I was crying  they would hug  me and make 
[03:07:30]  me feel better  that was my  I can't even  look at Ace  first you want  us to beat  you up  then you want  us to hug  you  I don't  understand  what that  means  I may have  seen violence  as a boy  I don't know  but I would  just  that's what  I remember  is that they  would just  really beat  me and throw  me down a  flight of steps  and then while  I cried  I think he  wishes it was  a sexual  dream now  I didn't have  sexual thoughts  yet  sadomasochistic  thoughts  but not sexual  but they made  it better in the  end  they would make  it better  and I didn't  understand it  that like why  would kiss be 
[03:08:00]  at my apartment  in Edison  and why beat  me I was a fan  but like why  would they beat  me and what  would my parents  do about it  poor little  feller  was there any  particular guy  in the band  beating you  maybe Gene  I think it was  all four of you  just beating me  and being mean  to me  yes and then  Gene was suing  me  that sounds  right also  yeah you guys  were all hitting  me and then Gene  was making me  take off my  money bags t-shirt  doesn't he own  the copyright  to that or  something  yeah  oh Gene  copyrights  anything  yeah 
[03:08:30]  what do you  think of all  the kiss  merchandise  did he go  too far  I always thought  it was over  the top  you did  right  I did  that's a nice  honest answer  right there  from Ace Frehley  I don't mind  buying some stuff  from my favorite  bands but oh my  god it got dizzy  I think when  Gene came out  with the caskets  yeah that was  a big one  I kind of like  was the icing  on the cake  for me  I wouldn't be  buried in that  so there has  to be a picture  of my daughter  crying over  a kiss  casket  I think it  would be  hilarious  somewhere in  the world  hopefully crying  what if she  sees that bank  account 
[03:09:00]  this is what  I get  and then I  got more  depressed  when I saw  my royalty  check  I guess  that's where  one guy  you know  being a math  teacher or  whatever  kind of  you know  more of a  did he have  the most  business savvy  would you say  of the four  guys in the  band  absolutely  and do you  think that he  capitalized on that  or kind of  shared it  with all four  guys  well  you know  Gene  capitalizes on  anything he can  for himself  and it's a  trickle down 
[03:09:30]  theory  because you want  to know that  the guys are  doing well  you want to  know especially  you know that  like Peter and  Ace who have been  out of the band  the longest  are doing okay  because it was  you know there  was four guys  and look  no disrespect to  the stuff that  happened after  the makeup  there was some  good tunes  but Kiss  really existed  from I guess  73 to 80  right around there  that's the way  most of us  look at it  until you left  that's what the  band is  you know not  to the other  guys were great  but you know  you Peter  Paul and Gene  were the band  well the good  thing about Ace  also is  and I talk  about him  he's right here  yes 
[03:10:00]  is that  you have  people know  you as a  solo artist  too though  it's not just  like oh  here's Ace  from Kiss  like he's been  out  he's been  out solo  and been  successful  as a solo  artist  so you know  it's not  like oh  here's  I think it'd  be harder  for someone  like Peter  to go out  and do  something  whereas Ace  has just been  out so  so long  doing solo  stuff  you know  Jimmy's a  musician  too  Ace  and he  covers your  songs  I'm really  not a musician  no  is there  any 
[03:10:30]  dignity  left  in Jimmy  do we have  an example  of Jimmy  covering an Ace  Frehley song  I don't know  I never did  Ace Frehley  which one did  you do  I may have  done Beth  one time  which was a  pretty song  Beth  I hear you  calling  but I can't  come home  right now  me and the  boys are  doing some  radio  and I can't  find the  sound  that's hysterical 
[03:11:00]  he was on  the piano  we don't have  New York  group  we really  don't have  New York  group  oh yes  you do  back in  the New  York  group  we're back  back in  the New  York  group  I can't  either  I forgot 
[03:11:30]  about this  who's playing  the drum  that was me  so you complicated  the drum beat  because the drum beat  is only this  you complicated  a lot of things  that day  they added music  I did that  because we were  at K-Rock  and who had  left their drums  there  Carmine Apice  was playing  later  I think Vanilla  Fudge was  going to be  in studio  and they didn't  want anybody  touching the drums  nobody touched 
[03:12:00]  the drums  so I sat down  and just belted  out a little  New York groove  just to annoy  the radio show  after us  I never realized  I'd be sitting here  with fucking  H Freely  if you guys  showed him  a photo  of me blowing  someone  I would be  less embarrassed  not that those  photos existed  but I'm saying  that I would  be less embarrassed  I didn't think  it was that bad  Jim  thank you  you know what  it was a new  twist  to the song  I think you're  going to waste  some money though  I didn't write  that song  a lot of people  think I did  I was written  by Russ Ballard 
[03:12:30]  who's Russ Ballard  who's Russ  who is Russ  he used to be  in Argent  oh Argent  hold your head up  hi  hey how happy  are you by the way  are you happy  to see  have you seen  the Anvil  documentary  on those guys  did you know  those guys  coming up  Anvil  yeah  I've never seen  it from the beginning  again  I saw little clips  of it  I thought it was  real interesting  you know  that there's  this resurgence  now with Anvil  and you know  hey  God bless them  you know  anybody who can  you know  make it happen  you know 
[03:13:00]  go for it  do you take into  account like the fact  like you really are  like a lot of guys  mention you  as an influence  I was just watching  it's funny  I was watching an interview  with Layne Staley  actually recently  because I'm not a big  fan of that band  and they're like  you gotta listen to him  so I was watching him  interview and he said  one of his biggest  influences was Kiss  and didn't you go on  and jam with Pearl Jam  a couple times  when they were in New York  what did you play  with those guys  we did  what's that  Neil Young song  Heart of Gold  Sleep on Rocket  in the Free World  Rocket in the Free World 
[03:13:30]  that's the one  I did that  with them  at Atlantic City  and at the Garden  we did  Black Diamond  oh wow  and the guitar player  what's the guitar player's name  I don't know  I've never been to Pearl Jam  any of the grunge guys  I never paid attention to  and he's a good friend of mine  his phone number's  in my phone  Stone Gossard  Mike McCready  Mike McCready  yeah  anyway  Mike got all  he was so nervous  because he sang  the beginning part  that Paul sings 
[03:14:00]  and you know  picks nice and softly  before the power chords  come in  and that was like  the first time  he sang like that  so  but we had a lot of fun  so you don't get  uncomfortable covering  a Kiss song  with another band  right  you're fine with doing that  excuse me  you don't mind  covering a Kiss song  with another band  like you're cool  playing that  you know  it's part of my history  I mean tomorrow night  I'm going to be  at the Garden Center  what's that  PFC sign  what's the name  oh the  PNC  PNC  yeah  I'm actually  going to jam  with Nickelback  oh really  tomorrow night  do you know  what you're playing  I think I'm going 
[03:14:30]  to do an ACDC song  Highway to Hell  or something like that  so you guys  see I  as a rock fan  you always think  that like a guitarist  will just show up  backstage and go  can I come on  and play  and they're like  yeah come up  and jam  but I guess  you kind of  fucking plan  in advance  what an idiot I am  he's laughing at you  I love this  I don't blame him  I know nothing  about show business  but you're in show business  Ace Freely  I know like  Ace is in the audience  with his guitar waving  what a fucking fool  I am  just managers  and agents  and limo rides  to be set up  and sound checks  how am I an asshole  too good  who's at the window 
[03:15:00]  we got pretty girls  out there  hi  hi  where are you going  wow  who is that one  they're either going  to Martha  or the gay channel  we have a gay channel  okay  yeah  all the microphones  are on the seats  it goes okay  I'm used to that  oh thank you  I'm used to that  he's like  why are you telling me this  that's just kind of  that was Brooke White  from American Idol  walk away  oh was it  going to Al Q  bring her in here 
[03:15:30]  they get every guest  from American Idol  but we have Ace  I'd rather have Ace  than some chick  from American Idol  Truff's  you know when Ace  tells us he's got to go  or whatever  boy they hot up  those chicks  I don't know how  they do it  they're just regular girls  when they walk  into that audition  and then they got  these fucking  look  she's just regular chicks  bring it over  bring it over  fucking raging bull  bring it over  you called those tits  hey pick a number 
[03:16:00]  from one to four  any number  do I have to say it  out loud  yeah  I'll take three  turn it over  what  tell the audience  what just happened  he writes  he writes down  one two three four  he says pick a number  between  one and four  I pick three  and I turn it over  and he had already  written down  why three  that's really  uncomfortable  what if he said 
[03:16:30]  two Ace  I would have said  why two  that's that's just  the way  that's pretty cool  I thought maybe  it was the old  now open it up  there's a different  number  you did that  like  wow  alright do another  one  I'll pick three  again  I didn't bring  my bag of tricks  does it have  anything to do  with the size  of the number  or the breaking  the breaks  in the numbers  and it's not 
[03:17:00]  I don't think  he had time  to think about  that  alright let me  try it  god that's  ok think of a  number  just say a number  between one and ten  nine  ok see now  I'm wrong  I put seven  because someone  said it's  seven  in my head  I said seven  and I think  the same thing  it's like  what you will  more than likely  pick  seven for some  reason is the  most common  number  but I didn't  get nine  but I came  close  it's my  daughter's  birthday  what is  nine  the ninth  july  ninth  it was just  past  this time  oh okay  if it was the  seventh  yeah  then he would  have been 
[03:17:30]  right  if it was  the seventh  yeah I would  have picked  seven  that was  just like  Ace Frehley's  trick  my trick  stunk  I tried to  play a trick  and it failed  what an awful  trick  nailed you on  that one  I know  I always make  fools out of  myself in front  of kiss  I'm never  dignified  fucking Gene  blew me off  for a photo  I almost broke  down and cried  what a fool  I am  I'm 41 years  of age  why don't I  just man up  what's the  matter with me  just a little  creep  I was watching  Saturday Night  Fever  last night  what a hoot  what a hoot 
[03:18:00]  that is a funny  one to watch  man  great movie  Tony  you didn't  call me  you didn't  call me  no no  it's a ride  it's a ride  what's your  favorite part  of the movie  is it when he  falls off  he falls off  the bridge  I like when  the chick goes  what do you  expect me to  do  he helped  me  he helped  me  he helped  me  he helped 
[03:18:30]  you  that's good  that's a ride  that's okay  that's a ride  and then the  mother  the mother  has a man  face  you know  and they're  smacking each  other at the  dinner table  he'll go back  to the church  he'll go back  what was the girl  Jim you know  Donna Pascal  is that her name  I don't know  Stephanie was  the name in the  movie  yeah my favorite  goes you happy  Annette  now you're a  cunt  you're a cunt  Annette  getting gang  banged in the  back of the  fucking Chevy 
[03:19:00]  by a bunch  of guys  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  I don't remember  the movie  you don't remember  the movie  of all the  movies I watch  and quote  Ace comes in  and is quoting  one I haven't  seen in 10  years  I do nothing  but watch  movies except  Saturday Night  Fever  you could have  been quoting  back and forth  I know  I know  instead I play  a trick  and I get  the wrong  I'm off  by two  I truly am  a faggot  somebody should  shit in a bag  and throw it  at me  fool  Ace is  entertained  do we want  when Jim 
[03:19:30]  wanted to  share a  banana  oh you want  to hear this  one  what  yes  wow  Ace  would appreciate  this  a banana  he's sincere  too  Jimmy's very  needy  I think  you've picked  up on that  by now  he had a  banana  and he wanted  to share it  with Gene  because he was  looking for a  moment  well Gene  was in the  room  so I thought  I don't  want to be  selfish  and this  is sincere  this isn't  even a bit  yeah  how was it  because you know  Roast and Gene  was you know  can I take a  bite  sure you can  have the whole  thing  I'll actually  share it with you  if you want  like you tried so hard 
[03:20:00]  I'll actually  like it's not a fact  why did you need to  share a banana  with Gene Simmons  I don't know  because Gene asked  for a bite  of my banana  I would not do well  in prison  I actually do a magic  trick with a banana  if you invite me  back  for real  I swear to god  okay  I do a special  thing with a banana  but we can't talk  about it right now  next time I'm here  do we need a girl  here or no  no  okay  it's not necessary  we can find a banana 
[03:20:30]  can we do it on our queue  I have to get mentally  prepared to do it  you have to kind of  psych yourself up  it's one of the  hardest tricks I do  to be in that headspace  yes  do you really like magic  you like doing magic  or is it just  when I was a kid  I used it to pick up girls  yeah you do a couple  magic tricks for a chick  and next thing you know  she goes hmm  boy you can do that  I wonder if I can do  something else  you know  you know what though  but that's honest  because it's like  and then you get into music  it's like that's also a job  but you're fucking  you're gonna get laid  who do you like in that world 
[03:21:00]  what world  as far as magicians go  because some of them  are just hats  you know there's so many  good guys  I mean I'm a big fan  of close hand magic  close hand magic  I can't remember  anybody's name  okay  you like Penn and Teller  those guys are pretty  close up  those guys are funny  I mean they're not  typical magicians  I would say  you know  but I like the  I like the guys  who do that close hand magic  where you just can't  slide a hand  slide a hand  it's amazing  it's fascinating  Chips Cooney  Chips Cooney  maybe is he  oh Chips Cooney 
[03:21:30]  is one of the greats  fucking  hang out with the greats  doesn't he  you got Copperfield  you got  who's that  who's that younger kid  David Blaine  the uh  Chris Angel  Chris Angel  yeah Chris Angel  does he use camera tricks  though  because Chris says he doesn't  but uh  I would say on that TV show  he does absolutely  it's almost like you'd have to  but uh  I like David Blaine  as far as  sleight of hand goes  but that other shit  yeah just the street magic  it's horse shit  he hasn't done anything  lately  didn't he  lock himself up  and bury himself  we were at the last one  and it was such a bust 
[03:22:00]  that he's now got away  what was he  hanging or something  hanging upside down  like  yeah it was just ridiculous  yeah he does stuff  that's almost like  it's old morning show  bits  Ace  the levitation  for real  morning guys  used to do this  type of crap  to try to get an audience  where he floats a little bit  like that was kind of cool  you're like  oh the man is floating  but then you'll kind of  look at how he did it  he levitated  yeah yeah  he would do this thing  where you have to stand back  but you could watch him  check it out  this is probably on YouTube  where he actually floats  and you're like  wow that's pretty impressive  and then I think I saw  how he did it  I'm like god 
[03:22:30]  I saw it this weekend  how he does it  he steps up on a  he steps up on something  yeah he's got something  behind him  that he steps on  and I know that sounds  like very obvious  but you don't see him  doing it  but I didn't know that  I thought the man  was floating  I'm a very gullible  birthday boy  Jimmy you just want to believe  you're right  I'm convincing myself  we just want to believe  this is it  yeah  levitation  pretty good 
[03:23:00]  that was pretty impressive  yeah that's gotta be  a camera trick  the David Blaine  one's camera  the Chris Angel  one he shows you  how he does it  see I could do it  this way  watch  watch  he can do it  he's a magician  watch this  I could levitate myself  you're gonna like this  no you don't look like  you're levitating  yeah cause the one foot  looks up  yeah I see it  you gotta be at the right angle  yeah  I see it  but that's what they do  they kinda stand up  on one toe  stand up on one tippy toe 
[03:23:30]  you sell it with a nice wobble  and then the other foot  is completely on his ground  it looks like both foot  off Guinness  over the weekend  you gotta sell your wobble harder  I might Guinness  over the weekend  while I was talking to them  I'd get a hold of the material  I'd say okay watch  while I'm doing this  and talking to them  saying stay right there  I'm taking my left hand  removing the panel  and when I come back around  I just pull it apart  so it's done  now I'm ready  in position  to take my leg right out  remember it's important  he steps out  to create some misdirection 
[03:24:00]  you don't want them  concentrating on your legs  at this point  you want them looking  elsewhere  I'll show you  which is probably  the most difficult part  to get your leg out  implanted  and then to get your leg  back in  is where you really  need to be slick  so when you're in this position  I usually just bring  my hands forward  while I come  and get everything  into position  what he's doing is  now the next phase  of this is just literally  to balance yourself  as we discussed before  and just create the illusion 
[03:24:30]  and presentation  that you're going to float  arch your back  look up in the air  bring your hands up  and be  yep  okay  he's doing it  now you've got to keep  your heel  he's stepping on  he's got a fake  front to his pants  so when you're behind him  he'll pull his leg out  through the fake front  so from the back  it looks like both legs  are there  what about the trunk  in front of him  yeah but what about  the trunk in front of him  you do it on a curb  or something  people don't see you  doing it  and this is the position 
[03:25:00]  you land  your foot  this is a disappointment  son of a bitch  we thought it was really  a magic foot  a man of intrigue  I thought one guy  could actually float  yeah  that's pretty cool  and then he steps back  into the shoe  in the pant  he just floated up  onto something  to make it look like  it was floating onto it  but he was just using it  to float  what do you think  about YouTube guys  fucking love it  yeah YouTube rules  it's unbelievable  everything's on there  what's your favorite  videos on YouTube  Ace  oh I don't know 
[03:25:30]  there's a guy  that does a hand thing  that's pretty funny  it's called the hand thing  look it up  look it up Danny  Sean  it's a hand thing  it's a hand thing  it's a hand thing  it's one of the funniest  fucking things  I don't think there's  a lot of hand videos  on YouTube  so we should be able  to find this immediately  Danny just put the hand thing  in the search  you never know  you never know is right  Ace won't find it  is it a magic trick  it's silly actually  alright put silly hand thing

[03:45:00]  you suck at that  I'm not good at games  I was never good at puzzles  ah you're panicking  why are you doing it  that way  how are you supposed  to do it  do it the other way  I guess you gotta do  the best way  is probably do it  like this  do it like a normal  you think you're drawing  a dick  dude you just  drew a penis head  wait  what  hold on  I just drew a penis head  I think I'm getting it  no that's tits  what are you doing  am I fucking  am I a little bit  better than a  that's a danish  that isn't it  a pretzel  it doesn't interlock 
[03:45:30]  oh  yours is flat  yours has some  dimension to it  are you framing that  yes  why wouldn't  why wouldn't I  oh my god  it's gonna be hanging  all over  people are gonna be like  what are these things  time's up  I have fucking  time's up  he's gonna have  aces and his  you know  side by side  no it doesn't  why don't you just  draw them as the links  what's the point of this  well I can do it  in like 10 seconds  let me watch you do it  because I can't do it  it's like  it's like an interlocking  it looks like two  chain links  interlocked 
[03:46:00]  kind of crossed over  the secret to do it  is to just  go like that  so you make the square  first in the middle  oh you make a swastika  you work your way out  little bumps on the end  of the swastika  on the  and then you just  make bigger bumps  and connect them  over  wow  14 seconds  damn  14 seconds  pretty sweet  okay  what is that  Jay you came on a busy day  we're watching YouTube videos  and watching Jimmy Sketch  I know  he probably feels like  he's doing a retarded
