<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a particularly pungent fart by crew member Danny, immediately transitioning to the upcoming appearance of Andrew Dice Clay and the "Beer Summit" involving President Obama, Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., Sergeant James Crowley, and Vice President Joe Biden.  The hosts extensively mocked the media’s overblown coverage of the Beer Summit, focusing on the beers consumed by each attendee and speculating about Biden’s drinking habits.  They also jokingly brainstormed names for Dice Clay's planned "Dice Fest," envisioning it as a low-budget affair featuring Dice Clay, his son's band, and other lesser-known comedians.

In-studio guest Judd Apatow promoted his new movie (with mixed reviews), leading to a discussion of Seth Rogen's laugh and a recap of a previous, awkward in-studio appearance by Felicia Pearson from *The Wire*, which involved accidental misgendering.  They also mentioned a prior interview with Michael Emerson from *Lost*, highlighting one crew member's (Travis) intense fandom.  A voicemail from Jimmy detailing his consumption of his own semen after hours of masturbation in a cramped film-set trailer elicited amusement and disbelief from the hosts.

The show then covered Boston police officer Justin Barrett's racially charged email ("Jungle Monkey Gibberish") about the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr.,  Mayor Menino's response, and Barrett's unconvincing apology on Larry King. This led to a humorous discussion on the difference between describing behavior and using racial slurs. A hilarious Whackbag prank involving a badly photoshopped image of Jimmy with a red mustache for a listener's birthday graphic provided comedic relief.

Further discussion of upcoming guests (Dice Clay and Judd Apatow) ensued, along with Anthony sharing an erotic fiction piece he'd written featuring a man with an exceptionally large penis.  D-Boy (Derek) joined the studio, prompting criticism of his tattoos, followed by a highly explicit and frustrating phone call with Jessica from Jersey, who detailed a problem involving a man with an unusually large penis, resulting in the hosts hanging up.  Audio from Justin Barrett's Larry King interview was played and dissected, followed by Judd Apatow's in-studio appearance, where he discussed his career, working with Seth Rogen, and recounted anecdotes from his promotional tour, including a humorous incident on *The View* involving a bikini wax.  Steve the Whistler and listener calls concluded this segment.

Judd Apatow's extended interview covered his favorite films (*Young Frankenstein*, *Airplane*, *Harold and Maude*, *The Last Detail*, *Fast Times at Ridgemont High*, *Punch Drunk Love*), his experiences with various comedians (Jack Nicholson, Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, Rodney Dangerfield, Paul Rodriguez, Louis C.K., Ray Romano, Barry Sobel, Rosie O'Donnell), and challenges faced during film production, such as Katherine Heigl's reluctance to appear topless in *Knocked Up*.  He discussed the making of *Funny People* and his experiences as a stand-up comedian. A sexually explicit bit about "Bobo" attempting and failing to achieve erections on-air, with Christina's involvement, followed.

A segment focused on celebrity encounters, including stories with the Dalai Lama and Jerry Lewis, the cancellation of *Undeclared*, and analysis of uncomfortable moments in *King of Comedy*, including sexually uncomfortable experiences with Larry Amoros.  Andrew Dice Clay's arrival prompted stories about their past interactions and impressions of various actors (Al Pacino, John Travolta, Michael Madsen).  Apatow again discussed *Funny People*, including a humorous childbirth anecdote, before leaving.  The conversation returned to Dice Clay until Jim Norton promoted his upcoming shows.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to Dice Clay, primarily focused on an update about his children's band, L.A. Rocks, playing at the Whiskey a Go-Go.  However, constant interruptions by Anthony, filled with crude sexual language and boasts about his influence on Dice Clay's personal life, dominated the segment.  A mistaken identity involving a Steve Zahn impersonator occurred before the real Steve Zahn and Mila Jovovich arrived.  The segment concluded with promotional plugs for Dice Clay's shows, Jim Norton's shows, and "A Perfect Getaway," and a bizarre, sexually suggestive exchange with Bobo, the sound engineer.

The final segment involved a cryptic discussion about Dice Clay's "Dice Fest," with confusing back-and-forth regarding how Dice knew about the event, leading to a vulgar, sexually explicit conversation about bodily functions and sexual acts.  Dice Clay abruptly left the studio, leading to Opie's rambling, impromptu speech about teenage responsibilities, filled with explicit sexual descriptions and boasts about his children's accomplishments.  Ron and Fez were mentioned as upcoming guests, but did not appear.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll talk about the Beer Summit in a minute or two.  How are your headphones? Good?  Yeah.  Someone fart?  Danny must have blasted one off.  Oh, come on, Danny.  God.  My God, man.  It's Friday.  That is a nasty one.  Right off the bat.  My God, man.  Oh, my God.  Is that a beer fart?  Could be a beer fart.  Damn.  There's always a possibility of a beer fart.  So, it's going to take a lot of energy to get ready for our Andrew Dice Clay appearance today. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, I heard, right when I heard that Dice was coming in today, I'm just like, oh, God.  Get ready to stop everything we're doing when Dice arrives.  Yeah, no matter what we're doing, just throw it in the garbage.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Hey.  Hey, I got more album from my kids. 
[00:01:00]  Right.  You don't want to hear any more music from his kids.  You know, it's sweet.  But, Jesus.  Can we just do our show?  Why?  We're going to have to stop everything.  And we're also...  That's what I mean.  I think he...  We just heard that he might be coming in here.  The headphones suck today.  Do they?  I don't know.  What the fuck is this?  I'm working.  Are you processing or something?  No.  I feel okay.  Okay.  Anyway, I don't like it. 
[00:01:30]  No.  Like, I don't like it.  And we just kind of looked at each other.  Like...  Well, you know how it is.  I know.  Believe me.  Radio guys, the one thing...  That was yesterday.  We just need...  We need it to sound the same in the headphones every day.  Every day.  That's pretty much our thing.  Yep.  And almost every guy is the same as far as that goes.  Yeah.  So, it sounds a little weird.  So, I'm a little off.  But I'll adjust.  So, we're learning that Dice is going to do what? 
[00:02:00]  Dice Fest?  Yeah.  For real?  He wants to do Dice Fest.  That's why he's coming in.  He's going to try to get us on board with Dice Fest.  Yes.  To try to have us push it.  And it's going to be...  Dice Fest.  It's going to be comedians and bands.  Is that what it is?  It's pretty much our virus tour.  I want to do Dice Fest.  I want to do Dice-a-palooza.  I want to do Dice-stock. 
[00:02:30]  Dice-stock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It'll be hippies in the mud and my son's band.  What?  Oh, I see why Dice Fest.  Yeah.  It's going to be him, a bunch of no-name comedians.  Right, right.  Because Dice is going to take all the money.  Well, yeah, he's got to be the big man.  So Dice will take all the money.  So then you've got, like, open micers.  Yeah.  And then you've got his kid's band, and he'll call the whole thing Dice Fest. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, Dice-a-roo!  I'm going to call it Dice-a-roo.  I'm thinking that.  Or maybe All Points Dice.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Everything just stops in its tracks.  Hey, I'm here.  Stop your show.  Just stop everything.  But we want to talk about the Beer Summit.  Dice-eth fair.  It's just a bunch of broads. 
[00:03:30]  A bunch of broads.  And you?  And me.  And my son's band.  Yeah.  You're here?  We hear you.  Oh, God.  Do we hear you?  Oh.  Yeah, I want to help the starving little kids and the farmers.  Yeah.  Dice-aid.  Dice-aid.  That sounds familiar.  Dice-aid.  It's going to be me, some farmers, and my son's band. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  We get it.  You should record a song called We Are the Dices.  We are the clays.  These are my children.  They play guitar.  They're not a sings.  And I give up the album.  Good morning, Jimmy.  We're learning that Dice is coming in, and there's a rumor that he wants to start Dice 
[00:04:30]  Fest.  Dice Fest.  With a bunch of comedians and bands.  Yeah, huh?  But then we just learn, okay, comedian, he's the comedian, band, kids band.  And then fill it up with probably, like, open micers and, like, some garage bands.  Yeah.  Because, you know, Dice needs all the money.  Which way?  What time is the Dice thing?  Maybe we could call in sick for the second half of the show.  Nine o'clock.  I'm going to call in sick.  Can we please? 
[00:05:00]  We like Dice.  We just don't like that he completely takes over the room in a way where you just sit  back and watch his lunacy.  It's really, yeah, like, just take everything we were going to do.  You can't control him.  And just throw it away.  He's got the ADD.  They'll be like, so, oh, you see the beer summit thing that happened?  Yeah, man.  So I guess they kept the press at a distance.  Well, it was about 40.  What's this about?  It's the beer summit. 
[00:05:30]  I'm going to have beer at Dice.  No, Dice.  Which way?  You had the cop with the Professor Gates up there in Cambridge.  Well, I don't know nothing about that.  And then Obama sat down.  I don't know nothing about Obama.  Who's this guy?  That's exactly what we go through.  Is he going to be at Dice's Fair?  Anyway, Anthony, so what was weird about the beer summit, Biden was invited, too.  I don't know how he made it into the mix.  I know, like, who invited, who? 
[00:06:00]  Biden, you know, the Vice President of the United States of America.  I don't keep tabs on political tics.  I don't do that.  And you're like, you're just sitting here going, I just want to fucking cash it in.  There's nothing we can do to keep on track.  The whole world stops.  Dice is a car on the train tracks.  The whole world will stop when he gets here.  The whole world stops turning. 
[00:06:30]  If you feel a little nauseous around 9 o'clock this morning, that's because the world has stopped.  The world's just stopped.  Literally, it stopped spinning because Dice has arrived.  Dice-a-roo!  No, you're not going to do Dice-a-roo.  Wait, Dice-a-roo.  Wait, Relief.  Wait, which one was the one with the one?  Oh, Comic Relief.  Okay, sorry, Doug B.  Dice Relief!  Dice-a-c-relief.  Dice-a-roo-lea. 
[00:07:00]  Dice-fest.  Yeah.  I can't wait to hear this idea.  Dice-chella!  Dice-chella?  Hmm.  So anyway, at the Beer Summit, you had Obama, you had Gates, you had Crowley.  Obama was drinking a Bud Light.  Yeah, yeah, I'm going to serve that.  I'm going to have that at the festival.  All right, Dice, we'll get to that in a second.  So...  Wait, wait, say what?  So Obama had...  It's not important?  Who cares? 
[00:07:30]  They have some problems, and they drink a beer.  Oh, my feelings were hurt.  I need to have a beer with the president.  Who cares?  Let's move on.  Here's my son's new song.  Play it 30 times.  No, see, we were talking about, like, the Beer Summit.  Right. 
[00:08:00]  Dice Summit!  That's what I'm going to have.  Dice Summit!  And Sergeant Crowley had the Blue Moon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Gates had a Sam Adams Light.  Sam Adams, yeah.  Sam Adams Light.  And Biden had some weird...  Was it a non-alcoholic brew?  Was it something?  Was it a micro brew?  What the fuck was he drinking?  And why was...  Why are you talking about this?  Just...  Why, why, why?  The whole world is talking about this.  Not my world.  My world is Planet Dice. 
[00:08:30]  And everything revolves around it.  Does it really?  Oh, we understand.  We're in hell for a Friday.  We're in hell.  We like him.  We do like him, but...  Damn it.  Not today.  Not today.  Oh my god.  I know.  It's just...  A Dice appearance is he'll talk about his kids. 
[00:09:00]  We'll have to play about 15 new songs.  Then he'll...  Hickory dickory dock.  Everyone come to Dice stock.  And then he'll do some Elvis.  Jack be nimble.  Jack be quick.  Buy your tickets or you're a dick.  Look, we love the Dice.  Believe me. 
[00:09:30]  If we didn't, we wouldn't have him on.  But he's exhausting.  He's exhausting.  You don't have to eat with him afterwards.  You gotta go.  Well, because everyone knows you're like a loner, so no one bothers you anymore.  I just fucking jump in my vehicle and speed off.  We get stuck in a diner where then he now continues to talk about himself.  And then he asks you about, hey, so how are you doing?  And like, oh, this is my chance finally.  How are you doing?  Opie, what's going on in your life?  How are you doing? 
[00:10:00]  Well, I gotta tell you, Dice, you know, my girl, you know, we got married.  Yeah.  I'm really, really, really enjoying that.  Hey, that's nice.  Hey, so I'm doing this thing.  Exactly.  I got this thing I'm doing.  It's like, wait a minute, but I was talking.  He humors you by listening for maybe 10 seconds about what's going on in your world.  No, no, we'll get back to that in a second.  He says that a lot.  And it never goes, you'd never go back to it.  Cutshot Drew, the Dice side of the moon tour. 
[00:10:30]  Coke Logic, it's a touchy subject.  If you disrespect Dice, he'll be pissed eight years from now.  Do you remember when you, uh, this Dice?  You did a Dice Dice.  No, I don't.  That was eight years ago, Dice.  Yeah, I've been bothered ever since.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I will make up.  Let's go buy big clothes together.  Let's go shopping.  We'll buy giant clothes. 
[00:11:00]  The famous sweatshirt shopping day?  You and I were into it.  I still have that, by the way.  Yeah.  No, I don't have mine.  I have mine.  It's just sitting somewhere, and it's giant.  A homeless guy's wearing mine.  No.  Well, what happened was, we were into it, and we wanted to pick out the size that, and  we're like, all right.  At the time, I was like a medium, maybe a large.  Yeah.  I want to pick out something nice to fit.  I like hoodies.  I like sweatshirts.  No, no, no, no, no.  See, that's, it's small.  Right.  You know, it's got to be groomy. 
[00:11:30]  It's got to be big.  For how, for real, how big is your sweatshirt?  It is triple XL.  Ludicrous big.  Yeah, yeah.  It has to be, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can literally fit me and someone else in it, with our arms around each other, me out  of one sleeve, someone else out of the other, and be a two-headed person, and still be  comfy.  You can make, you can make money at a carnival, having people put on the huge sweatshirt, and  then take their beers.  Coke Logic could wear it.  Oh! 
[00:12:00]  Sorry.  It's true.  It's a big boy.  He is a big lad.  All right.  I'll, I'll, well, mine's gone, but maybe you could, you know, mail yours to Coke Logic.  And then we're like, can't we pick out a size that fits us?  And then, of course, we insist that we get the XLs, the triple XLs.  Giant, yeah, triple XLs.  And then they sit in our dresser drawers for years.  Can't wear it out.  Wear it out at all.  No, you cannot.  I don't think I've ever worn it.  No.  It just sits there folded as like a memento. 
[00:12:30]  So now everyone's looking forward to Dice showing up to talk about Dice Fest.  Dice Fest.  I think that's at nine o'clock.  Judd Apatow's in today talking about this new movie, which is getting really weird reviews  in both papers today.  Yeah.  He got one paper giving it three and a half stars.  The other paper's giving it barely a star and a half.  Wow.  Barely a star or something like that.  That just goes to show you that critics.  That's ridiculous.  That makes no sense.  It's one person's opinion.  But Rotten Tomatoes, that's why it's good to go.  Whether it's Rotten Tomatoes or another site.  I like Rotten Tomatoes myself. 
[00:13:00]  But you've got to find these websites where they put all the reviews together so you get  a more accurate average.  Oh, it's down a little bit.  Down to 65.  All right.  65 is still good, though, right?  Did Seth come in yesterday?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was good.  Except people hated his laugh.  Oh, really?  Hated his laugh.  I like his laugh because it's one of those stoner-type laughs.  Exactly.  I like the stoner laugh every time.  But, man, I got a bunch of tweets yesterday.  People were like, dude, you've got to isolate that laugh.  Maybe Travis could do that for us or somebody down the hall like they did with the Ron Howard 
[00:13:30]  laugh.  There's already things in the works.  Oh, there is?  Apparently.  Oh, really?  Ideas in the works, yeah.  Oh, so you're on this.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So you guys noticed a laugh, too, yesterday?  I didn't mind it, though.  You mind it, Danny?  No, I thought it was fun.  I mean, I just heard potential production.  Danny just heard gold.  Every laugh was gold.  But he was fun.  He was, you know, it was a good time.  And Louie was in here.  And Seth goes, oh, Louie.  Yeah, apparently they were at a comedy club. 
[00:14:00]  In L.A.  In L.A.  When they were practicing for this movie.  So they had to practice.  So these actors did some stand-up.  Right.  To, you know, research the role, you know, how they do that and everything.  So they did it.  And the crowd was pretty receptive to them.  So Louie's just kind of sitting back, you know, watching from the back of the room and  going, I cannot let them get away with the crowd being with them and thinking that's  stand-up comedy.  Right.  So Louie said this was during the time where he was really like hammering the crowd because 
[00:14:30]  he was getting ready for one of his specials.  And he went up there and destroyed it.  Good.  And made the audience go, oh, okay, that's a stand-up comedian.  So, yeah.  So these, you know, all these guys came over to Louie and were just like, Jesus Christ,  man.  Fuck.  Well, John is fucking, you're just amazing.  Well, Jonah Hill was quoted as saying that Louie C. Case's favorite stand-up.  Yeah.  And then Seth walked in and went, oh, Louie, Jesus.  And then told the story. 
[00:15:00]  How he made, just made them look just awful.  Ridiculous.  Which was cool to say.  By getting up there, yeah.  I'm glad Seth recognized Louie, but I heard somebody recognize Louie.  I want to kill myself, but I missed this week.  What a fucking week, you guys.  I'm so depressed.  Yes!  I told Anthony in the garage, I'm like, Jimmy is a weirdo because you're filming a movie  and I go, I guarantee he doesn't even give a shit he's filming a movie.  He wants to be here.  Ben and fucking Felicia Pearson.  Michael Emerson and Felicia Pearson.  I would literally have fucking given up the movie.  That would be Snoop.  That would be Snoop. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, Snoop.  Snoop.  Did she come in or did she use tears?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right through the window.  She came in and we all took turns calling her a he.  I just said dude and man.  But hold on.  But see, you don't know the wire and Louie, I don't think, knew the wire.  I knew better and I know that she's a she, but she looks so much like a he that you couldn't  help yourself and it just came out.  It really does.  For real.  That's as honest as I can be.  But me and Louie were having a pretty nice little discussion on race and race relations. 
[00:16:00]  And then I look over there and she's like putting her hands up in the air, like throwing  her hands up and kind of looking like, hey, yo.  And you know, we had the show on outside the studio.  Right, right, right.  I'm going like, oh, fuck.  Someone from Shade 45 is pissed off today.  And then Ope goes, holy shit, it's Snoop.  I was out of my mind.  And she comes in, sits down and just starts talking about like the wire and being in prison.  And she, yeah, she's fucking hardcore, man.  Oh, yeah.  She's a real thing, man.  Yep.  And because Jimmy was doing dope. 
[00:16:30]  Jimmy watched the wire.  So I got to tell him to his face.  She was she wasn't acting.  It was the same person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The same person was sitting here that you watched on the wire.  Michael Williams, who played Omar, found her in a bar or something.  Yeah.  She's.  Yeah.  I fucking.  She's got like nasty.  I mean, there's your presence.  She's got like.  Thank you.  She's got like nasty tattoos on her arms and stuff.  And I mean, nasty, like it wasn't like cute little freaking koi fish and no, no, no.  There were some tats that meant something on her life. 
[00:17:00]  R.I.P. on there.  People.  She killed probably.  Yeah, probably.  Dude, I couldn't fucking Danny texted me last night.  I was like, God, I know you must have went nuts.  I wasn't prepared for a Snoop interview, but we did OK.  Yeah.  She's coming back, though.  Oh, is she going to come back?  Oh, she supposedly.  I mean, we hear it a lot.  Oh, I'm a big fan of the show.  She might be.  She's probably a Lucky Louie fan, too, because I know that they said they would all watch it  on the wire, on the fucking set.  Who knows?  Yeah.  She said she's a fan.  We'll see.  Went to Louie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan. 
[00:17:30]  With that Baltimore accent.  Tell you carry yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Carry yourself.  And then someone gave her the wire.  The wire DVD.  And who this for?  And Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I signed one for him yesterday.  There's a few Jimmy's.  Oh, there's two for me.  Then there must be one that they got last night.  Oh, OK.  Oh, really?  I just thought that was funny.  That was very funny.  Jesus Christ.  And I got Anthony's tweet.  I saw Anthony's tweet about you and Michael Emerson. 
[00:18:00]  I was fucking so jealous, man.  Emerson was all right.  He's great, man.  He's great.  You know the show, right?  Yeah.  You don't watch Lost.  No, I have a new thing.  I'm going to be the last person on earth to watch Lost.  I got some tough competition out there, but I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to fly-strewn, bloated-belly African children.  Yes.  We'll see it before you do.  Yeah, I'm going to wheel up some TVs for those fuckers.  I'm cutting off your nose to spite your face, my friend, because it's a great show.  I don't care.  I got a little cult out there of people that haven't seen Lost, and we're all in competition 
[00:18:30]  together.  Trust me on this.  Great show.  Trust me on this, and I will win in the end.  Michael Emerson was really good.  But you know what?  Not knowing the show, it was a great interview.  I sat back and listened to Anthony talk about Lost, and Travis kind of like Googled at him.  Travis was a googly-eyed fanboy who sat there.  Now, I was like really fanboy, too.  I'm just blurting questions out, and his answers, I'm just looking like, holy shit,  fanboy, talking about how, well, you saw last season, and how his character became more 
[00:19:00]  sympathetic, which is an odd thing for somebody who was so hated to actually have a turn.  And he said it happened so gradually that he didn't even notice, reading the scripts and  stuff.  Just some interesting shit, I think, and for anybody who watches the show.  So Travis was sitting where Danny sits, right next to Michael Emerson.  And I just, at one point, was talking to Michael Emerson, so his attention is on me.  Travis has his head turned, and he's just staring at Michael Emerson because he's so close to 
[00:19:30]  him.  And he's just staring at his little round glasses, his little bend glasses and everything.  And he's just staring.  And I went, ugh, what a creep you are.  I was just making sure everything was all right, because, you know, Danny's not in the  studio, so I'm the in-studio producer.  You are a liar.  A creepy, scary, googly-eyed guy.  He fucking, he blogged about what a weirdo was staring at him in the fucking studio.  Ben did.  He blogged the island blog.  The island blog. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, he had a little vest on.  I hate that he took a picture with Travis.  I wish you'd have said no.  I know.  There's a picture.  I can't.  Michael Emerson with Travis on Travis's Facebook.  Very nice.  Because I was talking about how the makeup is really good on that show, because it's an  attention to detail that you don't usually see on a show, where, you know, months later,  you'll still see a scar that they've slowly gotten rid of a wound and turned it into an  actual scar on people's faces.  And they go, you know, he says they take, like, hundreds, thousands of Polaroids to make 
[00:20:30]  sure they keep that accurate.  And they actually had to cut out one of his punches, where he was supposed to get hit,  because there was no more room on his face for another wound, because he'd been beat  up so many times.  The only thing I don't like about Lost, and I would have told him this, is the fact that  everybody gets knocked out with the first shot.  Tunked out!  That's the only problem with Lost.  There's literally been 75 knockouts in the series.  It's just the way to just get somebody out of a scene really quick.  And then also, we got called out by the listeners, because we were talking about, he probably 
[00:21:00]  has to do a lot of hiking to get to these locations.  In Hawaii, you know, you're walking through the woods and up mountains, and he goes, yeah,  a lot of times, you know, we're hunkered down under an umbrella, you know, having lunch  and stuff like that.  In Hawaii.  And we've been walking up, you know, these hills and mountains and stuff like that.  And somebody goes, he calls that work, we call it a vacation, you know, you're in Hawaii 
[00:21:30]  under an umbrella.  Having lunch after a little hiking.  That's it.  Oh, okay.  You have to stay on vacation.  Hunkered down for 45 or 50,000 a week.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But he was really good.  Very cool to have him on.  That's great, man.  So, how's the movie, Jimmy?  Good.  There's not much to tell.  It's a small part.  We're having a great time.  It's, you know, it's just been raining, so I would say the first day we spent 12 hours  in a little honey wagon trailer and shot for about eight minutes.  Second day, we probably shot for about eight minutes as well. 
[00:22:00]  That's it.  It's a very, very, a lot of rain, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Oh, they haven't actually did a montage of them?  Lost knockouts where people get knocked out.  Leave it to Danny.  Travis, Travis.  Oh, Travis, there it is.  It's just, yeah, one hit, it knocked out.  They all hit in the perfect place to knock the person out.  Oh, ow.  Maybe that's key to the whole thing.  That one should have knocked you out. 
[00:22:30]  Mr. Echo is spinning his stick.  Mr. Echo with his stick will knock you out.  But they just do it to get somebody out of his scene real quick.  Yeah.  If they want to just move on without him.  Knock him out.  Yeah.  They don't have time for fights.  Yeah, that's their exit stage left even.  All right, fuck all that.  Jimmy, did you really eat your own cum?  Who wouldn't?  Yes, the picture of you.  You have to explain this.  We played your voicemail yesterday, and that was a rough one.  Why?  It was a rough one.  I never did it before.  Why not?  A young lady instructed you, and you had to comply. 
[00:23:00]  I don't listen to these before I hit send.  Oh, wow.  You probably should listen.  Because there's going to be a lot of people listening to them.  Yeah, I don't care.  What was the circumstance, as much as you want to tell?  I just jacked off.  I was fucking...  Again, I jerked off.  My dick was literally like a piece of knotted rope by the end of this trip.  It's been agonizing.  It's all I've been doing.  In the trailer.  I have hours to kill in that little teeny room. 
[00:23:30]  It's literally four feet wide by eight feet long.  I saw the picture of the trailer.  It's called a honey wagon.  It's not even a trail.  It's a honey wagon.  A honey wagon.  What is a honey wagon?  It's just a nickname they give it.  It's like a closet for you.  It's got like a little chair bed, but it's like in a sink and a little thing to put your  stuff on, and the toilets are in the next...  A trailer.  I have a bathroom.  This one doesn't.  It's down.  It's a shared toilet.  I saw the roll of toilet paper, though.  What?  You take the roll of toilet paper with you?  There was like a roll of toilet paper on the floor.  Oh, no, no, no.  Your couch goes over a toilet that's not active. 
[00:24:00]  Like, you could use one in there, but they don't have it active, so it's just a sofa  cushion over it, so the toilet paper is just in there.  You go to a regular bathroom and use it.  You mean normally you could lift a cushion up and shit in the couch?  Well, yeah, there's a toilet lid.  Yes, you could.  You could.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  You just, for hours, just sit there.  It's fucking the way it is.  So you were bored, so you jerked off and then decided to lap it up?  No, Cumsie's eating I did in the hotel room.  Okay.  I just figured somebody I was talking to I knew would like that. 
[00:24:30]  Cumsie's eating.  And she did.  There was a picture.  There was a picture of you licking your hand where your eyes look maniacal.  It doesn't look like, it looks like you're in a sexual frenzy.  Well, the tweet was different.  If you notice, the tweet was different from the voice.  Yes, yes.  You know, you have to send those things out separately.  Well, of course.  And you have to edit sometimes.  You have to take a photograph and cut it.  So, you know.  Certain.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I looked. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, look at your eyes.  It's like a shark attacking something.  Like lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes.  Didn't taste bad.  It was a real, it was a good one, too.  It was like a.  Yeah, yeah.  And I just said, fuck it.  And I did it.  And there was really very little taste to it until like 10 minutes later, the aftertaste.  It was like.  My apologies, ladies.  Wow.  The aftertaste.  The fucking aftertaste of it was horrendous.  How much did you slip up?  All of it.  But how much? 
[00:25:30]  I mean, you know.  Good boy.  Depends on how much action you're getting.  You could either have a lot or a little.  That was a pretty good one.  Pretty good.  Yeah, that was a pretty good as far as amount.  I had commented on the fact that after, you know, we heard your message that I have had  sex with a lady and then afterwards gone down on.  Yeah.  But not like put the tongue in. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  But just like, you know.  Yes.  The clitoris.  The clitoris.  The clitoris.  But, you know, you're going to get some, you know, what do they call that?  Collateral damage around the vagina.  So you kind of taste.  There is a blast to your area.  A little taste of, you know, when you pull out or something, there's going to be a little  left there.  So I have gotten a little, you know, taste of that mixed in with female stuff.  So I got to concur. 
[00:26:30]  It does leave an awful, awful thing going on.  It's got something to do with what semen is.  Because semen has to fight through to get to the egg.  It's got something to do.  Because it's sticky.  And it, like, it sticks to your.  It's like the.  It sticks to the inside of your throat or whatever.  Like it probably does to a girl's.  I never quite had that much.  Oh, my God.  I licked all mine up.  Ow.  And it was fine at first.  I was like, oh, that was nothing.  Okay, cool.  I went and rinsed my mouth out.  And then a few minutes later, I just noticed that there was a weird.  It ain't something weird. 
[00:27:00]  A little peanut butter.  I try to get peanut butter out of the roof of your mouth.  But it wasn't that sticky.  Like it wasn't sticky.  Like I couldn't talk.  It was sticky.  Like there was something, a film that I couldn't get rid of.  And I could just sense it was there.  It was kind of like.  Did you have to talk to people with cum breath?  No, I was.  That would have been embarrassing.  You have to deal with your cum breath.  Hey, wait a minute.  I recognize that smell.  Oh, she's very nice, though.  We did a brief chat.  She was doing a charity event.  So we talked before she left.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't know what to say to her.  The first day I was there, we were in the kitchen.  We had to meet Roger, the director. 
[00:27:30]  Look, you went pretty baby.  Believe me.  I didn't want to say that.  I didn't want to say anything that would get me in trouble.  All I was thinking was awful shit I could say.  Yes, of course.  I've Google imaged your nudes when you were 12.  But she was there.  And the first day she was there, she walked by.  And I went, hey.  And she just, it was all, it was like no one had spoken.  No.  She wasn't, it was, it was a complete ignoring, but she wasn't being rude.  I knew she didn't hear me because she was like, then she just went and it was just, I  knew it wasn't a blow off.  What did you, what did you think, though?  Hope no one hurt me. 
[00:28:00]  Go, hey.  Yeah, yeah, that would be embarrassing.  Because her eyes didn't divert towards me.  It wasn't like this guy I don't want to talk to.  It was literally, I was the invisible man.  Oh.  And I went, hey.  Just trying to be casual.  Hey.  But you finally got to talk to her?  Yeah, she just was there talking about going on some charity event.  I was like, what's the, uh.  Did she know you?  Wow.  I don't know.  I know, uh, Brendan Fraser did.  He was a Tough Crowd fan.  Um, and I, and, uh, yeah, he definitely did.  I think he was lucky, Louie.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, he was, he was very cool.  We, uh, we have something to play for you. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, okay.  I didn't mean to do what he told me to.  My sister has, she's hurt her child.  Seriously, you hurt her child.  How did she do that?  What's going on with it?  What is that?  I heard she's hurt her child.  Yeah, I kind of heard that.  My sister hurt her child.  We might have a mix-up.  Is it Doherty?  That's Doherty.  Is this and this mixed up?  I don't know.  All right, well, we'll have something to play for you after the break.  We'll figure it out.  I was like, I hope it isn't that.  I'm happy to be back, but. 
[00:29:00]  No, no, we want to surprise you with something, but.  I'm gone for a couple days next week, too, but then I'm finished.  You're busy.  I hate leaving.  A busy man.  A busy movie star.  I'm a movie star.  I'm a fucking Honey Wagon Zero, but it's fun, man.  It's a fun process.  It's just, it's a pain in the ass.  You're on your way, Jimmy.  You're on your way.  Yeah.  The Beer Summit.  I guess we could spend a few minutes on that.  I don't know.  It was as hacky as we said it would be.  I haven't seen video of it yet.  They set up a, I don't even know if you could call it a picnic table.  It was like a, like, like some just outdoor, an outdoor table and chairs, and Obama was 
[00:29:30]  sitting there all casual.  Not quite the love fest, though, that they were hoping for.  Hell fucking no.  No, no.  As a matter of fact, the officer there, the sergeant, Sergeant Crowley.  Crowley.  How could I forget that?  Mr. Crowley.  Just remember that.  Uh, yeah, he, um, he was like, well, you know, we had to agree to disagree on some things.  He goes, there'll be future dialogue.  No, there won't.  He goes, over, over iced tea or Kool-Aid, he said. 
[00:30:00]  Another beer.  That ain't happening.  The wrong message.  Well, actually, that might happen in Boston.  But as far as a national thing, that, it's over now.  Yeah.  It's completely over.  But Obama was there without his, uh, suit jacket, his, uh, sleeves rolled up.  Nah, he's just hanging out.  Just hanging out after work, having a beer.  And then, uh, and Gates.  On the roof of the White House, tarring it.  Tarring the roof of the White House.  We felt like real men.  Could have been working on any one of our houses. 
[00:30:30]  But they were on a, they were under a tree, and then the reporters and the cameramen were  like, I think, 40 or 50 feet away, so they couldn't really, they couldn't hear.  Thought of something.  I need to.  They couldn't, uh, they couldn't hear what, what the conversation was.  Well, what good is that?  Which is such a weird, you gotta see the picture.  It was very strange.  And then all of a sudden, Biden was there.  What did he have to do with this?  I can.  Um, Barack.  It's Joe. 
[00:31:00]  Haven't seen you in a while.  Right, exactly.  Could I, could I stop by for the beer thing?  I'll bring my own beer.  He's the guy that would bring, like, Meisterbrow to the party and take the Heinekens.  He'd bring some crap beer.  Uh, Danny ran out of the room, but he brought some beer I've never heard of.  I don't know if it was a non-alcoholic or, or what, but, uh, uh, I, I don't know what  to say about the beer summit.  Who gives a shit?  I think he had the beer summit countdown on, on a lot of the news channels. 
[00:31:30]  Are you kidding me?  This was so embarrassing.  Our media is a joke in this country.  It was a brilliant move by Obama, though.  It was, it was one of those things where this was about to blow up and he fucked up  badly by criticizing the police department and got good for them.  They didn't back down, man.  I was so happy.  I know.  And, uh, immediately he just has this stupid idea of having a beer together.  At least the guys talked and the air is out of the balloon.  Fucking, what a smart move.  Yeah.  No matter whose side you were on, it was a really smart move.  Yeah, it was.  And what was, uh, Biden's beer of choice again, Dan? 
[00:32:00]  It was a non-alcoholic beer called Bucklers.  Bucklers?  Bucklers.  Spud's Bucklers?  Did Joe stop drinking a while ago?  Does anyone know?  Spud's Bucklers.  Anyone know if he's, uh, kind of in a program or something?  I don't know.  I never heard he was.  A Buckler.  That just looks like it would taste awful.  But if there's alcohol, non-alcoholic beers, I believe, have alcohol in them.  A little bit.  A little taste.  You're not considered sober if you're drinking non-alcoholic beer. 
[00:32:30]  Really?  No.  Wow.  He's alcohol in it.  It's like drinking cough medicine, but not that strong.  Really?  Wow.  I wouldn't.  No.  I wouldn't consider someone sober.  I wonder what percent that is.  It's very light.  It's 0.5.  0.5?  Yes.  So why do they call it non-alcoholic?  So how many beers do you have to get to get some kind of a buzz?  Imagine getting fucked up off of Bucklers.  You'd be pissing and shitting like a madman.  You'd have a conscience.  You wouldn't even have a buzz.  Yeah, let's see.  We'll give that a whirl.  What is a regular beer?  Around 5, I guess. 
[00:33:00]  5, this is 0.5.  That's about fair.  No, 5%.  This is like half of a percent.  Okay.  So it's like 1 20th or something?  So how many beers, how many Bucklers to equal 1 beer?  Yeah, that's all we need to know.  Is that 10 or 100?  Okay, 10.  I always made that mistake.  I'm like, is it 10 or 100?  Just tell me.  I don't want to do the math.  Where's the fucking decimal point going?  Stupid.  Yeah.  So 10 of those equals 1 beer?  1 beer.  All right.  Oh, someone has a good point on why Biden was there.  Let's go to Rob in Massachusetts.  Rob.  Hey, good morning, guys. 
[00:33:30]  Hey.  Yeah, I think the only reason Biden was there, so just he basically evened up the races.  2 and 2, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  See, because the whole thing was...  People would have brought up something if it was just the professor and Obama.  Well, that's why our media sucks, because Obama goes, hey, come down to the White House.  Where was it?  Crowley.  I don't know who said it first.  Then let's have a beer and talk about it.  And then at that point, instead of it just being, let's hang out and have a beer, it's  like, well, what kind of beer? 
[00:34:00]  Well, the picnic bench can't be too close to the swing set, because that would show a  bad thing.  Right.  And then the reporters, well, we've got to put them over here.  And now we've got to balance out.  We've got to bring Biden in, so it's two versus two.  Then it just gets hacked, hacked, and just ridiculous.  They have to overthink the whole beer thing.  I need to know, though, how was the beer presented?  Did they have to uncap it themselves?  Was it in a glass already?  Did someone bring it out?  I need to know.  They kind of had to wait to bring it out. 
[00:34:30]  A butler?  A waiter, a butler-type person came out with the beers.  What race was the butler?  White.  No, right down the middle.  Was it?  What?  Malata.  Yes.  It was actually a zebra, the animal.  Nobody wanted to offend anybody.  The zebra walked out.  The zebra with it on its back.  You know, they showed some old footage of Reagan having a beer and Clinton having a beer.  When they decided to have a beer with people, they just basically picked a bar and went with it.  Yep. 
[00:35:00]  They didn't have to overthink the whole goddamn situation.  There's a lot of footage of Reagan just, like, in a bar.  Oh, yeah.  Drinking.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, guys.  Tapping out?  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jim in Rochester.  Jim.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  You know, everything was exactly how Anthony said it yesterday.  I put it on CNN, and all these douches have frigging beers on the counters.  Ew.  They're speculating which one they're going to drink, and then they're showing the stupid beer 
[00:35:30]  thump, and these assholes are frigging drinking beer out of a frigging mug instead of out of  the bottle or whatever, just like Anthony said yesterday.  You'd have no idea who's drinking what.  See, I know the news would like to do that and bring the bottles of beer in the studio  and speculate as to which ones they're going to drink.  That's the nation we are.  We're so easily distracted by a pinwheel.  Our mainstream media is a joke at this point.  It's just a fucking joke. 
[00:36:00]  You got me looking at the stupid screen, laughing my ass off, yelling at the CNN, telling them  to fuck off and everything.  I couldn't believe it.  Well, you saw the countdown, right?  What was it?  The Beer Summit countdown clock?  Which one?  Was that on Fox?  I think it might have been Fox.  A countdown clock.  And Gates ended up having a Sam Adams Light.  So I guess it's time to forgive, Jim Cook.  Give us a call, buddy.  Give us a call.  See, you're back!  He went with the Boston beer.  I was just waiting. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, what?  I was waiting for a friggin' crawly to come across the friggin' table with his mug and  just smack somebody right in the face with it.  They said he was the alpha male.  Because then they had experts looking at the pictures and the video and saying he was definitely  the alpha male in the whole situation.  Well, he's got the experience of doing that.  Although he was intimidated by his host, they're saying, because his body language was kind of  turned a little bit from Obama.  Well, president.  Yeah, of course.  Commander-in-chief.  Plus, he's probably got better stories than either one of those guys.  Nothing better than cop stories. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, I know.  What is Obama's stories?  Well, one time at Harvard, and here's another time I did something nerdy with...  Yeah.  And he's got, you know, great stories about racking some head.  Fucking, yeah.  And fucking domestic violence calls.  I would rather listen to his stories than Obama's any day.  Could you imagine him sitting there, has a few, gets a little buzz and goes, so one  time, this fucking gentleman, oh, damn it, was that close.  And nobody picks up on it that Obama's like, wow, he really says he doesn't like Canadians. 
[00:37:30]  I don't know if this is true.  Let's go to Jack in South Carolina, talking about the beer summit a little bit here.  Jack.  Hey, fellas.  Two things real quick.  One, Biden was probably drinking a non-alcoholic just so it gave the impression that at least  one of the commanders-in-chief was not under the influence.  And the other thing I wanted to mention, too, was, oh, God, say, oh, yeah, hey, how many  times do you think during a president's tenure, either four years or eight years, that they 
[00:38:00]  really get just fucked up drunk?  That's a really good question.  And who do you think gotten drunk the most?  That's a really good question.  I bet you they get the most a slight buzz.  Yeah.  At some kind of function, and maybe they have a little too much champagne or something.  I bet the old days, they drank a lot more.  The old days?  Fuck.  Yeah.  It's getting hammered.  Hell fucking yeah.  Not anymore.  You know, I think Jack makes it a good point.  That is a good point.  I bet you.  If you're president and vice president drinking, you'd be like, who's next in line?  Pelosi is going to fucking, you know, take over and run the country? 
[00:38:30]  And first of all.  They're hammered?  Yeah, but first of all, it's not drinking.  Having a beer is not drinking.  No, that is not.  And you know they didn't have a second beer.  I didn't see any sign that they had a second beer.  How do you have one beer?  So they should.  I don't understand this concept.  They should have just told the media.  One?  We're having a beer.  Fuck off.  Yeah, we're both drinking a beer.  Who gives a shit?  Stop being intimidated by the mainstream media.  They suck to begin with.  Well, they probably figure if a decision had to be made a nuclear war last moment, like  say we were attacked, and both guys had one of the influence of alcohol. 
[00:39:00]  I had some type of alcohol.  Even one beer.  One beer, you'd probably be like, well, you know.  That's just their thinking.  You know what?  Under one beer, you'd probably make a better decision.  Yeah, yeah.  That decision curve goes up with just one beer.  And in what world would you sit down for one beer with somebody?  Oh, my God.  For real.  That's all that was left on the planet.  We have one beer left, Anthony.  One beer.  And I'm not even making fun of you.  Like, I was at a retirement party for Mike Cole. 
[00:39:30]  He's retired from the NYPD.  I had a few beers.  You can't just sit there and have one beer.  It's very difficult.  What's one beer?  One beer.  You either don't have any beers, or you have a few beers.  That one beer shit is, what is that?  I don't know now, because I top off beers before they're empty now.  So you, yeah.  So it's one long beer to you.  I'll be drinking a beer, and it'll get halfway done.  It's like, oh, I'm going to go outside again.  Let me just top this off before I go outside.  Pull the keg.  Yes.  The guy came yesterday, because the Bud Light keg was empty again. 
[00:40:00]  So he came and wheeled another keg in there.  And, yeah.  Are you keeping track of how many kegs, like I told you?  Oh, no.  I lost track.  Little marks on the wall?  That would be hilarious.  Lost track.  That would be, all right.  No clue.  I don't know what the neighbors must be thinking.  I'm running a fucking speakeasy in my basement.  Pretty much.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker.  Good evening.  Hello, Stryker.  How are you doing, man?  So is this the Opie and Snowball show?  I just wanted to make sure.  Whoa.  Nobody snowballed, sir.  It's different between snowballing and... 
[00:40:30]  Well, you know how the listeners like to kind of stretch.  Yeah, Stryker, that's a big stretch.  I licked up Mike Humzy.  No one else's.  Given Obama's, or, I mean, Biden's medical past with his aneurysm and whatnot, that's  most likely why he's drinking alcohol.  That's another good idea.  He has had a brain aneurysm.  You got to think Biden is the big drinker out of those...  No, you're just lonely.  She looks a little better.  No, you're just lonely.  She looks good.  Like the dark hair.  He's taking a little look lately there.  Don Wicklin there. 
[00:41:00]  Don Wicklin.  Also, don't forget, Bush, I don't think, drank at all.  I think Bush is a complete non-drinker.  I think he's a reformed drinker.  But the Reagan footage was great.  He's in a bar in Boston just swigging him down with the locals.  He didn't care how he was being represented.  He's like, no, I'm doing a beer thing.  That's it.  You know Clinton had a few.  I guarantee he had a few nights that were fucking...  A little rough.  Yeah.  Oh, with that alcohol-ravaged nose of his?  He had to.  You know damn well he drank like a motherfucker.  And married to that? 
[00:41:30]  He had to.  You don't make Yasser Arafat wait while you fuck a fatty with a cigar unless you've had  a few belts.  You understand?  You don't keep the powers that be in the Middle East in the fucking tomato garden while  you cucumber rape a fatty.  Unless you've tipped a few back, Bill.  A couple of cocktails.  Exactly.  How do you not love them?  Jimmy James, New Hampshire.  Oh, he's good.  You're up.  Hey, you can come.  Jimmy.  Jimmy. 
[00:42:00]  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, I just had to correct the gentleman on why Biden was there.  It's just the fact that Obama's a huge fan of Sonny D commercials.  Yeah, it was kind of a Sonny D commercial that everybody represented.  Well, not Sonny D.  Well, do you want to get the racist beer joke out of the way?  All right.  Let's go ahead, big team.  Say whatever you're thinking.  How we doing, boys?  All right.  Atlanta.  One question is this. 
[00:42:30]  If Biden drank Bucklers and the cop drank Sam Adams, what did Obama bring?  Old English or 8-ball?  I mean, what was he drinking?  He said Colt 45, sir.  Colt 45, maybe St. Ives.  Who knows?  Was it a 40-ounce or was it a regular beer?  Later.  He said later.  Later.  Oh, my God, no.  Oh, you think this guy's thinking Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Charlie.  Hey, two things.  You know, it was just a big publicity stunt. 
[00:43:00]  It was probably ginger ale in mugs.  They weren't even drinking real beer.  That's why everybody had to stay away.  And two, Biden's probably a lightweight.  That's why he drinks non-alcoholic beer, so he can go beer to beer with the rest of the boys.  But when they're getting a buzz, he's hammered.  I imagine that.  He just gets completely snotted and starts yelling at everybody, belligerent, falls down face first.  Starts asking Crowley to fix a ticket for me.  He can stop.  Smacks his chin on the picnic table and he falls down face first.  Yeah, it was a photo op.  You're right.  It looked like a set. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  They set it up like they're getting ready to do a play or something.  It was an outdoor set.  Oh, that's it.  Okay, yeah.  I see the...  What do you got?  It's a no-nonsense-looking cop, though.  They call it a brouhaha.  There they go.  Look at them all.  Yeah, look at his no-nonsense face.  That cop's a no-nonsense fucking dude.  He is fixated.  Yeah, he's...  He does not like that fucking Gates.  You know what?  Sergeant Crowley, he's been all over the place.  He was on CNN last night talking about this or whatnot, or they had his press conference. 
[00:44:00]  The guy handled himself very well.  You got to remember, this guy was basically a nobody cop in Boston.  Kind of people knew who he was because of what he did back in the day.  Who was it, the player?  Lewis, right?  Was it Reggie Lewis?  Yeah, Reggie Lewis.  So he's kind of known up there.  He goes from a little-known celebrity to just the whole world knowing who he is.  And he really handled himself pretty good.  You get a B&E call.  Yeah, possible B&E, two males.  You're fucking a week later at the White House chit-chatting with the president and vice president 
[00:44:30]  while AP photographs you.  Yeah, what the fuck?  What's that happening?  And he's like...  He handled himself.  This picture, though, he has a scowl on his face.  Now, obviously, a second later, they could all be laughing their asses off.  Sure.  But he's got a scowl on his face.  Obama's kind of like, eh, you know, he's got, like you said, his shirt sleeves rolled up.  And then the professor is not looking happy either. 
[00:45:00]  Well, he's looking like a professor.  The other guy's looking like a cop.  Yeah, he definitely looks like a cop.  And Obama is making believe it's like a very casual after-work thing.  He should have had a suit jacket on.  How great if he just pulled a taser out and nailed the professor with his fucking taser.  Bam!  He was coming at me with his beer mug.  Well, that'd be great, but they're at the White House.  Crowley doesn't even have a toothpick on him.  No.  Wow, that is, yeah, that picture, eh. 
[00:45:30]  I'm not seeing a lot of love there.  It would have been funny if they played it out, because I think you're right, man.  Second beer, by the third beer, they're really telling each other what they really think.  All right, there's another picture where they're chit-chatting.  Now, the professor is listening intently, as is Obama, as Officer Crowley, Sergeant Crowley, speaks.  God, I wonder what he's saying.  Probably something like, you put Velcro on the ceiling. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, my God.  An empty boat.  One, officer?  Excuse me?  Five, if you slice them thin enough.  You think there was a point Crowley was feeling good?  Like, okay.  Yeah, I think I can slip one in.  I think I can slip one in.  Let me see.  Well, let's go to Abby.  I believe one of them folks was from Arkansas.  It continues. 
[00:46:30]  Get it?  It continues.  That one.  I believe one of them folks was from Arkansas.  Get it?  Let's go to Abby in Jersey.  Abby.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, Abby?  I'm just going to excuse my interruptions.  I'm looking at a photograph of David Patterson in the newspaper, and of course, he's looking  the wrong way at the camera.  Why wouldn't he be?  It's so amazing.  Abby.  If you look at the post pictures, if you look at the bottom right one, Obama is completely 
[00:47:00]  done with his beer, and everybody else has like three quarters left, so he downed his.  The rest of the guys are just kind of sitting there drinking like women.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Obama was getting rid of his beer.  Because Obama is the everyday man.  That's what he wanted to portray yesterday.  I don't know.  Did he have a smoke?  I'll say.  He don't smoke in public.  You know what?  Because it's hard.  I know if you're trying to quit smoking, it's very hard to stop while you're drinking.  And he's been known to smoke.  Imagine if he pulled out a pack, lit up, and then kind of offered everybody else a cigarette. 
[00:47:30]  Like endorsing just beer and Marlboros?  Yeah.  This country would be in a frenzy today.  Like smoking Marlboro in front of everybody?  We'd get to talk about the cigarette for the next week.  Yep.  On CNN and Fox and MSNBC.  I think, has there been any outcry over the fact that they chose beer?  Has anybody come forward mad or...  They were able to kind of, you know, we're just having a beer.  It doesn't matter.  Some people think it sends a bad message that beer is a solution to a problem. 
[00:48:00]  Like, believe me, I'm only saying it because this country is silly and stupid enough where  somebody has to come forward and say, you know, but the problem-solving thing over beer,  why did it have to be an alcoholic beverage when it could have been...  Eh, shut it.  Just shut up is right.  Let's take our first break.  Kool-Aid and grape juice.  And then, let's see.  The professor will have grape soda.  The president will be having Kool-Aid. 
[00:48:30]  And the officer will be having an iced tea.  We're going to take our first break.  We've got two hours before Dice arrives.  This fucking...  This is one last thing with this whole Boston cop thing.  This is Justin Barrett.  What a dummy.  He sends out that...  What did he say?  The fucking banana-eating jungle monkey called Lewis Gates?  Oh, yeah.  And said other cops turned him in?  Yeah.  It's like, what are you doing at this time?  I know.  How stupid are you?  It was a mass email I read today.  I didn't know it was a mass email.  Yeah.  It's not a private thing that was just leaked. 
[00:49:00]  No.  Then you have a right to say it.  But if you send out a mass email...  And he sent one to the...  I think it was the Boston Globe as well.  Well, read near the end there, Jimmy.  I wonder if he's a drinker.  Like, why else would you...  I sound like my aunt, but why else would you do that?  Yeah, that's kind of dumb.  He was trying to offend himself on CNN.  You think he hit send and went like, oh, shit.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  He said he did not mean to offend anyone.  It was a poor choice of words.  No, no, that.  What was a poor choice?  Banana, jungle, or monkey?  Which one of those would you have switched?  Would you have made it oranges? 
[00:49:30]  I think that poor choice of words is if you say, hey, you're black instead of African-American  and they get offended.  You might go, well, I could have said African-American.  Right, right.  That might be a choice of words, you rethink.  Yeah.  Can you defend this one, you think?  No.  That's a rough one, right?  Indefensible, this one.  It really is.  Yeah, yeah, this is a tough one.  Read on, Jimmy, because I think near the end of that article.  The words were being used to characterize behavior, not describe anyone.  Barrett told the Boston TV station, vowing to fight and attempt to fire him.  People are making it about race.  It's not about race. 
[00:50:00]  Yes, it was, actually.  I'm saying that.  Well, you could use a different animal, a different food.  There's plenty of things you could do.  Where's the...  It's ridiculous.  He actually wrote it to a columnist, calling her column about Gates' arrest, Jungle Monkey  Gibberish.  There you go.  That was the other one.  But the bottom line, Jungle Monkey, everyone knows, in our language, we have that kind of  commonality of understanding what certain phrases mean, like, the Giants didn't really  kill the Jets.  No, we don't want them arrested. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So we understand what that means.  Everyone knows you talk about Jungle Monkey or Jungle...  You're talking about a black guy.  No one can say that you're not talking about a black guy.  Right, right.  You're not characterizing behavior.  If you said this guy's a savage, that's a behavioral characteristic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  But Jungle Bunny or whatever, like, that has all...  It's like saying, ah, that disgusting Mick, and you're talking about an Irish guy.  No one thinks you're talking about a guy named Mick.  Yeah.  Everyone knows what you mean.  Exactly.  And do we have Mayor Menino's audio on this?  Because he's all over the news talking about this guy and how he should be fired.  We've got to have the audio today. 
[00:51:00]  Got to.  Find it, please.  Need it.  And the officer was on CNN trying to defend himself on Larry King, I think, last night.  If we can find that audio as well for after the break.  If you write an email like that as a cop, and you say, hey, I'm a cop, and this is what  I think to a...  Cop you with it.  It's hard to defend firing.  I mean, to defend him.  Yeah, I know.  Very, very hard.  All right.  It's just that stupid.  It looks like he may have a bias if he's going out on a call.  By using those words, you can almost kind of predict what he would do in certain situations 
[00:51:30]  out in the field.  Here, Obama backs up on something he said.  The president criticized you guys, and he fucking backs up.  Yep.  And then you write that.  It's like, you dummy.  That's what we said on the air.  You dummy.  Just keep your mouth shut.  You idiot.  Absolutely.  The guy...  Obama backed up.  Yep.  Yep.  This is what we wanted to play for Jimmy about 20 minutes ago.  Oh.  Oh.  It's your birthday time. 
[00:52:00]  Today's birthdays, of course, include the ones we missed on Friday, and also today's.  Happy 14th birthday to Gina Reed.  Birthday wishes from your mom and dad, your brothers, Eric and John, your grandparents,  aunts, and uncles, Lucky and Mittens.  Happy 41st birthday to Ted Sheckler.  Birthday wishes from your mom, dad, uncle, Paul, and GD.  Can you freeze frame that?  Oh, damn. 
[00:52:30]  I have to tweet that picture.  That is fucking great.  Wait a minute.  Freeze frame that fucking picture.  Are you kidding me?  Do we know what local news station this was?  It's News 9, wake up.  Ted Sheckler.  They're doing their happy birthday, say.  And they have Ted Sheckler, age 41, on the screen, and then a picture of Jimmy with the  most horrendous red mustache I've ever seen.  It's a horrible mustache.  Who did that?  Somebody.  Can we even know who did that?  Yeah, some guy on Wackbag.  I can tell you in a second.  That is so goddamn funny. 
[00:53:00]  Wait.  And we laughed over who's wishing him a birthday.  You gotta hear the end of this.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  And I gotta hear the whole birthday wish.  You know what?  I think we got a new bit.  We gotta keep this one going somehow.  These dumb local news channels will fucking say anything.  It's Ted Sheckler.  Ted's a fool with a bad mustache.  He's horrible.  He's 41.  Listen to the end.  Listen to the end.  And your aunts and uncles, lucky and admittedly.  Happy 41st birthday to Ted Sheckler. 
[00:53:30]  Birthday wishes from your mom, dad, Uncle Paul, and Steve.  Steve.  Uncle Paul.  It's Steve Steve.  Wow, that is good.  Oh, that is goddamn funny.  That graphic.  Who the fuck gets credit for this?  It's horrible.  Oh, that's so great.  Oh, is that graphic awful?  That is brilliant.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you, Uncle Paul. 
[00:54:00]  Can we put the word out there to get this going?  This is a bit that needs to have a little life.  Oh, God, is that great?  It's too fucking good.  Ted Sheckler.  What a coup.  Whackbagger named Rage Cage.  Wow, that's great, man.  That is fucking hilarious.  Okay.  Bravo, Rage Cage today, man.  That is fucking huge.  Ted's a goddamn idiot.  You know how stupid Ted looks in there?  Ted looks like a buffoon.  What makes it is a horrendous mustache.  I know.  It's a fake red hair.  You've never thrown a mustache like that.  It's so obviously photoshopped on there. 
[00:54:30]  Like, they didn't pick that up.  Dude, that's so awful.  It's not even balanced on Jimmy's face.  No, it's crooked.  It's slightly off.  Ted Sheckler.  Sheckler.  Just to see his name in the big wake-up nine news happy birthday graphic.  I'm going to laugh all day about that.  That is so good.  You've got to hear that again.  It's viewer birthday time.  Today's birthdays, of course, include the ones we missed on Friday and also today's. 
[00:55:00]  Happy 14th birthday to Gina Reed.  Birthday wishes from your mom and dad, your brothers Eric and John, your grandparents, aunts, and uncles, Lucky and Mittens.  Happy 41st birthday to Ted Sheckler.  Birthday wishes from your mom, dad, Uncle Paul, and Steve C.  And Steve C, yes, happy birthday, Ted Sheckler.  I missed it.  It must have been on a Monday.  My parents will always forget my birthday. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, Ted.  They were always late.  That must have been very nice to see them celebrating your birthday.  I got very choked up, Anthony.  Somebody remembered my birthday.  I would always get one a week later.  A pair of socks from Mother.  Mother.  Happy birthday, Theodore.  Mother.  Fuck, is that good?  God bless you.  Bravo.  Hey, we got the Seth Rogen laugh for after the break.  We got Dice coming in in less than two hours. 
[00:56:00]  Judd Apatow talking about funny people.  That bastard makes a lot of successful movies.  In less than an hour, man.  He'll be here.  That's very cool.  And I think we'll do a little F.U. line.  Why didn't I bring in a Judd Apatow movie?  I don't own any.  I go get one.  There's a few out there.  I'm frightened.  We'll do the F.U. line as we go to break here.  Lots to do today, man, for this Friday.  Opie and Anthony.  And Lil Jimmy's back.  Opie and Anthony, Friday, live programming for you. 
[00:56:30]  I hope you enjoy it.  Hello.  That Ted Sheckler thing is fucking funny, man.  And it was Rage Cage on Whackbag, you said?  I think he started something.  I don't want this to be a one and done. 
[00:57:00]  No, no.  I really don't.  This has to continue.  But keep it underground because, you know, we got people that listen to this damn show.  Keep it underground.  But try to get a few more done.  And I tweeted the picture and I tweeted the video for everybody.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  Follow me on Twitter, Opie Radio.  Antirotic Encounter.  Seth Rogen laughing.  We got to get a lot of stuff done because Dice comes in here at 9 and then we just sit here and watch him.  And, yeah, everything gets derailed.  I'm so glad that we're finally bringing that to the table. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Because we all think it.  I think that every time I hear Steve pitching Dice, when he goes, yes, Dice wants to come in.  I'm just like, all right, pick a day where we know the show can just be derailed.  Yeah.  What is my erotic encounter?  You want to go right to that?  I'm very curious.  All right.  I was just going to get some knowledge out there real fast.  I know I did say a couple of things this week.  Well, I just want to get a quick bit of knowledge out there.  Oh.  Curb Your Enthusiasm is doing like a Seinfeld thing. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, apparently the entire cast of Seinfeld.  This sounds like a great idea, right?  Yeah.  Because with Seinfeld, you kind of don't want them to come back because you know they'll ruin a good thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But Curb Your Enthusiasm with Larry David and they got the main players.  Are they going to be their characters or are they going to be other people?  Oh, boy.  I didn't read that far.  I didn't read that far.  No, they're going to be themselves.  Yes, but apparently it's a five-episode arc and they're doing a – we're going to do a Seinfeld reunion. 
[00:58:30]  So you're seeing the behind-the-scenes stuff at the Seinfeld reunion.  That's what this is about.  Are you kidding me?  Yes, it's a very good idea.  It's almost like –  Well, that is good.  It's going to be massive ratings.  That's a great idea because everyone wants to kind of see a reunion.  But this way they do it in a way where they kind of save face.  Where they're goofing on – they could goof on those reunion shows relentlessly.  I'm sure Jerry isn't going to want to do it.  Kramer's probably just going to yell the N-word through the whole series of shows. 
[00:59:00]  How are they going to handle that?  I know.  Oh, I'm sure they'll –  It's got to be addressed.  Larry David seems like the only person in Hollywood that would just address it.  Just address it.  Yeah.  Honestly.  The fake reunion, there'll be a problem with black protesters or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, that sounds like a great idea.  I'm looking forward to this.  Definitely.  Maybe we could get Larry David in here to talk about that.  Sure, we can.  That would be huge.  Yeah, that'll happen.  We can, right?  No.  Why?  Because one of those guys we'll never get.  No.  No.  We're lucky you can get Louie.  We can get intern David. 
[00:59:30]  Remember him?  Yes, I booked him to explain it.  Yes, we have the prep sheet.  I have a couple of pitches to go over.  Al Pacino.  Um, no.  He's not doing radio.  Yeah.  Fucking dumb bellow.  So, Jesus Christ.  Would you guys like Jesus?  Vladimir Putin.  We're not getting him.  We have Rich Voss and possibly Vladimir Putin. 
[01:00:00]  That's our world.  When is this Curb Your Enthusiasm starting up again?  In the fall?  I don't know.  So, did they film this already?  Oh, sure.  Fuck, man.  I want to know more about the Seinfeld thing.  We should get Jeff Garland in.  He's on Dustin Press.  He's funny.  Oh.  You like Jeff?  That's funny.  All right.  What's the matter?  I hope he's making a funny face.  What?  No, I think my coffee is sour.  The coffee is a little off?  Yeah, the milk's like curdled or something.  Aw. 
[01:00:30]  He looks like Eddie Trunk, though, which makes me laugh every time I see him.  I mean, Eddie Trunk are separated at birth.  Somebody did something about Anthony doing something.  So, let's do this now.  And now, another in a long line of erotic adventures with Anthony Cumia.  As Anthony pulled into the parking lot, his heart began to race.  The poorly lit rest area was very isolated, and the sounds of cars rushing by on the highway  was the only thing that could be heard in the night's air. 
[01:01:00]  He pushed open the restroom door.  Standing there was a tall, muscular man Anthony had met online.  He had short black hair and sweat trickling off his biceps from the heat.  Oh, my God!  Anthony's asshole began to twitch.  Is this what you came here for?  The man said as he let his jeans slide to the ground.  Oh, my God!  Get the fuck out of here!  That's scary!  It was the biggest Anthony'd ever seen.  His mouth began to water, and slowly, still catching his breath,  he walked over to the man and whispered in his ear. 
[01:01:30]  I want to suck your cock.  Anthony slid all 12 inches into his mouth.  He gagged as the thick meat sword poked the back of his throat, but he wasn't satisfied.  Do you want to put it in my ass?  Anthony spread his shaved hole open in anticipation.  Put it in my shitter!  As the cock entered his ass, Anthony moaned with joy.  The young stud pounded Anthony hard.  Fuck me in my shitter.  Anthony cried out.  Harder and harder, he slammed Anthony's tight, warm hole. 
[01:02:00]  Toodley-doo!  Toodley-doo!  Toodley-doo-doo!  Toodley-doo-doo-doo!  Suddenly, Anthony felt a hot load spray deep within his ass.  The young buck pulled out, leaving Anthony's asshole gaping and dripping with cum.  Oh, come on!  Anthony couldn't help but giggle.  This is embarrassing!  The two men exchanged glances, but said nothing.  As they left the restroom together, walking off into the night,  Anthony could only smile, thinking of the ravaging his anus just took,  and said to himself,  I'm such a faggot. 
[01:02:30]  Jesus Christ!  What was the hardest part of that?  Replacing the name Steve with Anthony?  Exactly.  That's what I want to get into.  I know, wow.  There's only two answers.  Yeah.  That's from experience.  Steve's experience.  Of course.  Or he got some kind of erotic literature.  Yeah, yeah.  And I want to know the answer immediately.  I bet that is right off the top of Steve's head.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Is that...  I don't know.  You want to bring D-Boy in here and talk about it?  Why D-Boy?  D-Boy.  Derek.  Oh, D-Boy.  That's his new name.  D-Boy.  Yes, D-Boy Mathers.  Let me go get him.  D-Boy.  Anyway, we should bring him in anyway because...  But Derek doesn't like being on the air.  We should bring him in anyway because I really need to review his bad tattoos.  I haven't seen him in a while.  Oh, he has the fucking worst.  No, I hear he's got a good one.  He makes fucking Jack from Lost look like he has great tattoos.  We have a lady that needs some help, though.  Oh, really?  Is that one of our girls coming down the hall? 
[01:03:30]  That's one of ours, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy, wait till you meet the new one that we met yesterday.  I heard part of the show.  Are you allowed to be on our...  Oh, boy.  I heard part of the show while coming in.  That didn't go well.  Where?  She ran by.  Oh, well.  Christina.  She's busy.  She's not allowed on our show?  Hi, Derek.  Hello.  How are you?  Anthony wants to talk to you.  Oh, first of all, that production piece?  Yes.  Where did Steve come up with... 
[01:04:00]  Where did all that dialogue come from?  Was it from a book?  No, it was...  I actually went online and looked at some gay erotic stories.  Stories?  I write stories?  Yeah, I just took little bits and pieces.  Yeah.  I didn't know where to find that, did you?  Yeah.  Typing.  Just typing.  Typing.  Gay erotic.  It's called a toolbar, my favorites.  Yeah.  Did you add in certain things like the rest stop?  Yeah, the rest stop was my idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a very good production piece. 
[01:04:30]  Thank you.  But Anthony wants to look at your bad tattoos.  What's that one say on your calf?  Yeah, let me see.  No muscle?  Jesus.  Fucking cancer legs?  Jesus.  That fucking foot should have a toe tag on it.  Let's see the bad...  I want to see the one with the face.  That's the girl riding the microphone.  That's fucking horrendous.  That face is like that Wildenstein woman.  Right.  Who did that?  Did you do that?  No.  I actually got it when I was 18.  It needs to be touched up. 
[01:05:00]  Do you want us to fix it up for you?  It's called with laser.  I just need to...  Could someone out there do the right thing and touch up that really bad tattoo for Derek?  Yes, with a fucking shawarma knife?  Just shave it down?  That is horrendous.  Maybe do it in studio.  We'll give you a nice plug.  Help out, Derek.  Because a tattoo needs to be touched up.  Tattoo artist at Auschwitz was more talented.  Who's this fancy artist, David Pedersen.  No, we'll get that fixed for you.  I'll do it as long as they're good and it's like that guy that Dave used.  They couldn't be worse.  Contact the usual suspects if you want to touch up that tattoo. 
[01:05:30]  I hear you got a good one coming in, though.  The arm sleeve?  Yeah, the one on my arm is pretty good.  Danny said it's really good.  For real, right?  Why would you fucking keep going with tattoos after that?  D-boy.  D-boy.  Not D-man.  D-boy.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Let me see.  That's some work.  That's a nice sleeve.  It's a giant octopus.  It's a giant octopus.  And a koi fish.  Yeah, it's like in that cartoon style, kind of like Bob Kelly has.  Holy shit.  Yeah, it's sort of, uh, yeah, that's very.  Wow, that is your entire, from your shoulder down to your elbow. 
[01:06:00]  I don't know.  I always wanted one for some reason.  Do you like octopuses?  No, I thought it just looked cool, actually.  That's what we talked about the other day.  I know.  If you're going to get a tattoo, make it mean something, but whatever.  What's that mean?  Just a big koi fish and an octopus behind it going, hello?  A fish and an octopus.  I think it's going to eat it.  You know what?  You know, you can make fun, but that is a nice piece.  It's well written, drawn, yeah.  And I was just talking to Anthony about how I hate color tattoos, and now you turn me around  on that?  That's some good, that's a good color tattoo.  It's like the ocean with wispy hairs on it. 
[01:06:30]  Why are there hairs in the ocean?  Where do you swim to find fucking hairy water?  What do you have, fish in your sink after you shave?  There's an octopus in my sink after I shave.  Hairy water.  Fucking hairy water.  How long did that take?  It actually still needs to have little parts of it done, but probably about eight hours.  But it looks too good, you have to ruin it?  Yeah.  How come the fish is flesh color?  Who saw the fucking flesh color fish?  Well, the fish was there long before everything else was done.  Oh, really? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  You put water around it.  Oh, you incorporated stuff around the fish.  Oh, yeah, we remember the fish, because we did the whole koi fish thing.  Yeah, the fish were at a bus stop, and they just thought it looked inappropriate.  It's like, we should put the fucking ocean around this thing.  Why is that fish wearing a Sam Slade hat?  Very nice, though.  By the way, the fucking white guys with the little derby hats, the little fucking, the  little, you know the white guys with the little brim hats?  Fucking, that look is horrible.  You know what they wear, like, the t-shirts and the little dressy Jack Klugman type hats?  I'm so tired of it.  That look is taking off, though, Jimmy.  It's taking off.  It's that corny East Village, I'm kind of artsy, but kind of official hat look. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh, it makes me want to throw up.  A hat!  Oh, no.  Dice, you're not here yet.  Another hour and a half.  Hey, thank you, Derek.  Lou from Connecticut, maybe for the boys down the hall.  There's a lot of things the guys should be maybe searching for today.  If you come back with some of this stuff, that'd be great.  If not, it's okay.  It's Friday.  Who cares?  Lou in Connecticut writes, bad radio alert.  Local radio is doing a break on which celebrity you'd rather have a beer with. 
[01:08:00]  Are you kidding me?  Could you fucking imagine how horrendous that would be to listen to?  Are you kidding me?  Phone call after phone call, what celebrity you would have a beer with?  Well, let's play the game.  Billy Martin.  There you go.  But they wouldn't go there.  I couldn't think of that.  They wouldn't go there at all.  I'd like Harry Chapman would probably stop when it happened.  Billy Martin.  Billy Martin would be fun.  Right through the windshield.  And we've got a girl that needs our advice, Jessica from Jersey.  Jessica, what's the problem?  Billy Martin. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know.  I met this guy in high school.  I was in love with him.  Jim Leritz.  He would have been my first.  I just couldn't get it in.  He was too big.  Jessica, why are you still talking when people are talking?  I apologize.  We've got to start over.  So, Jessica, what's up?  He's too big?  Yeah, he was too big.  And we couldn't fit it.  And he would have been my first.  And that was in high school.  But now, all these years later, like, I found him again.  And, you know, we've been going out, like, to strip clubs and going back to the hotel. 
[01:09:00]  And I lived far and I came here, you know, all the way just to see him.  It's been two nights writing.  We still can't do it.  And I want your advice.  Because his cock is too big?  Yeah.  And, like, I don't know what to do because I can't get it in.  Like, I haven't had sex in years.  And I want him.  Here's what you do.  Just get it wet because it hurts me, too.  So, you have to wet it up a little bit to get it in.  Yeah, that's my big dick.  Boo.  Boo.  Why don't you grease that fucker up?  Yeah.  He's right.  Get some Crisco. 
[01:09:30]  I don't know.  But we've been drinking.  And it's, like, it's too tight.  Drink a little drink.  What are you talking about?  Do you use any kind of lube?  Yeah.  Maybe if you lube it up, it'll slide in better.  How big is his dick that I can't get in there?  Yeah, really.  Yeah.  A baby comes out of you.  Yeah, really.  I've never seen anything like it.  But the problem is that I want him.  I want to have him.  I can't have him without sex.  How big is his dick?  Like, uh...  Is he a black man?  No.  Actually, no.  He's just, like, you know, very, like, six, eight.  He's just big, you know?  Like, is it thick like that? 
[01:10:00]  Jesus, Danny.  Is it thick or big?  Like, you gotta...  What the fuck?  Like, size 15 foot.  So, tell me, what do I do?  Let me know.  No, Anthony wants to know how big...  Yeah, how big is it?  How big is it?  Is it, like, like, how big in inches and...  Inches.  I can't even count.  The ruler's too tall.  Just fucking measure it.  You're the worst.  Yeah.  How big would you say?  Have you put your hand around it?  Is it, like, holding a Gatorade bottle?  Like...  Yeah, yeah.  Describe it.  Give us some perspective.  Jesus, Danny.  Don't fuck.  Give us some perspective.  It's bigger than the ruler, you know? 
[01:10:30]  What do I do?  She's still going that way.  She's the worst.  Where is he right now?  He's next to me right now.  Then why don't you take a real ruler and put it against that big, delicious, soft cock and  tell us how big it is.  Holy shit.  We should get...  We should get them to have sex on the show as he tries to force this big hog in her.  Just tell him to just jam it home.  Do you got any lube in the area?  No.  Have you taken fatter shits than his cock is?  No.  Oh, so...  And the ass is out of the question, I guess. 
[01:11:00]  This phone call has such potential.  I know.  We can't get anything...  How big is the guy...  Where are you right now?  I'm in his car right next to him, and I want to rape him, but I just cry because I feel  like I know it can't work.  Ask him how big his dick is.  He knows.  Believe me.  Probably like 14 inches, boys.  No way.  The biggest thing I've ever seen.  Like, it's unbelievable.  Like...  You want her to go down on him?  Is it fat?  Yeah.  I'm a big.  Big in every way, you know?  No one's 14 inches.  I don't believe this. 
[01:11:30]  I know.  All right.  Is this a camera phone?  Let's take a picture, and we'll show them.  Go ahead.  Mail it to whatever Danny's email address is.  It's amazing.  I'm telling you.  I just don't believe it.  All right.  You're going to send a picture to Danny, and then you're going to get...  And then if...  And then what?  We got to do something with her.  You want to gag on it a little bit for everybody?  So what's your advice?  What does he do?  What do I do?  Besides the normal shit that you do with the normal guy.  Put it in your mouth.  Show me how you suck a man's cock. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Show me how you suck a telephone pole.  I don't know.  What do I do?  Lean over and put it in your mouth.  Miss, how many times do we have to say the same thing?  Lean over and stick it in your mouth so we can hear it.  And keep the phone close.  Oh, my God.  Like, I don't even think...  I can't even get it in.  Like, if you get it in your mouth, you fuck.  Do we have to give up on her?  This is terrible.  This could be good radio.  It's terrible.  Holy shit.  I don't believe it.  They're bullshitting.  I've never seen more booze in my life.  She just fucking stinks. 
[01:12:30]  Hang up on her.  She's lying.  Awful, lying phone call.  Jessica, what are you trying to do today?  For real.  Yeah.  What's the gimmick?  What's the gimmick?  He's trying to have sex with Tim.  You're not.  And he told me to take off his pants so I can't even do it over the phone.  See, just hang up.  She's a fucking waste.  I'm a waste of time.  You're a waste of time.  The call was a waste of time.  Yes, it was.  God.  You're bullshitting.  You're repeating yourself.  No, it's just too big.  We get it.  It's big.  We get all right.  Now we need a slut out there to make up for Jessica.  Give us a call.  If you're a slut and you're willing to gag on Big Cock. 
[01:13:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  All right.  Moving on.  God damn, that's frustrating.  Look at that.  What a dumb cunt is coming in.  Oh, it's.  Thank you, Opie.  Worst call ever.  Worst call that could have been a good call.  She was off.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the difference.  Full of shit they're calling you.  Yeah, of course.  So now if you want to call back.  Maybe she's seven.  And prove us wrong.  That's why.  She might be with her talking skills.  They're horrendous.  Judd Apatow.  Is that how you say his name? 
[01:13:30]  Apatow, yeah.  Judd Apatow.  Apatow is coming in to talk about funny people.  Getting mixed reviews.  Good reviews, bad reviews.  News, so I don't know.  Rotten Tomatoes has given it 65% positive reviews.  Seth Rogen was in yesterday promoting the movie, and we had a good time with him.  And we all noticed that his laugh was a little over the top.  I didn't mind it, but it seemed like a lot of listeners did.  Danny, you minded the laugh?  I didn't mind at all.  You didn't mind it, right?  Yeah.  I liked the stoner laugh every time.  Yeah.  Did you like the laugh? 
[01:14:00]  Hate the laugh?  Fine.  Fine by me.  I didn't hear it.  They were really bothered by the laugh out there in Radioland.  Yeah, for some people.  So I think we took the laugh and did a little something-something.  Ladies and gentlemen, fresh from their recent string of shows in Vienna, presenting the  Seth Rogen Tabernacle Choir.  Can I hear one real thing? 
[01:14:30]  Can I hear the laugh?  That's funny.  I don't know what it sounds like when in context.  That was pretty much it.  We could get an isolated laugh.  Yeah, Travis would find that.  That was a little piece of a laugh.  Yeah.  Yeah, Travis has something if you want.  All right.  All right, Travi. 
[01:15:00]  Were you pissed off at the title bullshit with Zach and Mary?  It was like...  Yeah, Harvey Weinstein's a real motherfucker.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, that guy.  That guy.  You go, man.  You go, girl.  Wow.  Yeah, he decided to change the title the week before the movie came out.  That's his laugh.  That's all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like it.  Yeah.  But, all right.  Very good job with the Tabernacle thing.  Hey, we were talking about Steve the Whistler yesterday, Jimmy.  Oh, man.  We can't get enough of talking about Steve the Whistler. 
[01:15:30]  I don't know how it came up, but for some reason we were compelled to just bring it up.  And Danny found his picture where he's leaning against his bad Buick.  And he's in an awful sweater.  And it's the cover of his disc.  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  He could actually let tune, though.  There it is.  And, uh...  Oh, what a douche.  Anthony, after yesterday's show, someone emailed me a very short video of just Jimmy.  Jimmy's in the foreground. 
[01:16:00]  His body's completely turned away from Steve the Whistler.  He's making believe he's looking at a CD.  He's losing it.  He's laughing so fucking hard.  And Steve the Whistler's in the background whistling a happy tune from WNEW.  I remember.  That was so uncomfortable.  Could we find that?  It's in my favorites on my YouTube channel.  I threw it up there.  But you gotta see fucking Jimmy.  I know it's a visual, but we'll make some kind of radio out of it for everybody.  Go in the favorites.  I love Steve the Whistler's photo because the car's in the woods.  Yeah, what's he doing in the woods?  It's a weird place. 
[01:16:30]  Shallow gravy sticking for the shovel.  It's got the shovel in the back.  Exactly.  Hunting dogs are looking for...  Look, turn the screen for Anthony.  I've never seen Jimmy lose it like this before.  Jimmy's now looking at a CD.  He goes back to Steve the Whistler.  Jimmy's laughing his balls off.  Okay. 
[01:17:00]  Very nice dynamic.  You trying not to laugh is so fucking funny.  It sounds like an instrument.  I just knew it was coming. 
[01:17:30]  Holy shit.  How long is this song?  Yeah.  But that's a very good demonstration.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Jimmy just trying to keep it together.  Big logo.  And that fucking guy.  Oh, I know.  How annoying was that just to look at?  Ridiculous.  Like, like, it's all fun and everything.  The material will make it about you. 
[01:18:00]  Brought to you by.  The fuck.  And there it is.  The giant fucking logo.  Right or ready.  Jesus.  It is all right or ready.  That doesn't happen anymore.  Oh.  But anyway, Steve the Whistler came up in a conversation saying to stop bombing Nagasaki after the bomb dropped.  You know what I mean?  Yep.  A bomb joke.  You ever notice bomb jokes using bombs usually bomb?  And when they do, they're uglier because it was so obvious what just happened. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Let's say how to Ryan.  Oh, no.  He lost Ryan.  He's not a fan of the Steve the Whistler.  We're a fan of how long.  How long is this song?  Yeah.  How long is this song?  On and on a right already.  Fuck.  There's nothing worse than when you're whistling a song than someone asks you how long it is.  How long is this?  That doesn't imply enjoyment.  No.  I know we did it yesterday, but can we read the bio for Jimmy? 
[01:19:00]  The one part where he says that it's been known.  It's been known.  Wait.  He's been known to have people follow him for blocks.  For blocks.  Like the Pied Piper.  Just to hear him whistle.  People follow him.  That is the biggest bunch of bullshit I've ever read in a bio.  Maybe not.  Maybe I couldn't believe that all these African-American gentlemen were following me.  Yeah.  Ready to clunk him on the head.  There is.  What does it say there, Danny?  For real?  Uh, hang on.  We just had Sheckler's birthday wish again. 
[01:19:30]  It says, uh, pedestrians in the crowded streets of Manhattan have been known to follow him for blocks,  a la the Pied Piper, drawn by his music.  Why Allah?  Yeah, what does Allah have?  Jimmy, do you think anyone has followed him?  No!  No, I don't.  Not even once?  Never.  Really?  Unless it was to say, shut the fuck up.  Don't do that past my window again.  It's probably just a homeless guy with a brick.  Yeah.  Just waiting for his opportunity. 
[01:20:00]  Exactly.  Some guy wants to steal his whistling lips.  Right.  It also says here, in fact, listeners often say they, quote, can hear singing in his whistling.  No.  What?  Who says that?  No one.  He did.  Hey, you whistle good.  That's what they say.  No one's saying that.  Come on.  All right.  Only, he, he, look, fair is fair.  That guy whistles up a storm.  Fair.  Who gives a shit so? 
[01:20:30]  I've been known to fucking, people flock to my door while I'm showering, and I'm whistling  as I fucking finger clean my crack.  This guy's a big deal.  Who gives a turkey?  He's a big deal, though, because it says here that at both the 2003 and 2004 convention,  Steve was awarded-  What convention?  Hold on.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's the International Whistlers Competition.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no, there's not one of those.  Steve was alone in a ballroom.  Whistling in a partition.  Well, I don't know.  It sounds pretty legit to me.  Steve was awarded the prize of North American Champion, as well as the coveted title International 
[01:21:00]  Whistling Entertainer of the Year.  Yeah.  Just whistling in front of Lloyd, the bartender.  All alone.  We had Steve the Whistler's relative on the phone, and they just hung up.  Really?  Call back if you want in.  Oh, please.  I got to listen to this again.  Grandparents, aunts, and uncles, lucky and admittedly.  Happy 41st birthday to Ted Sheckler.  Birthday wishes from your mom, dad, Uncle Paul, and Steve Zee.  I love it.  That fucking mustache is so awful.  It's awesome. 
[01:21:30]  The picture alone would have been fantastic.  Like, just your picture.  The fact that that bad mustache is photoshopped on there is classic.  That's the picture to use.  You got to put a baseball hat on him one time.  Yeah, you just got to keep working it.  Just keep working the look.  Just keep working the look.  An earring, maybe?  Yeah.  Each time you got to add a new accessory.  A monocle.  A monocle.  A monocle.  A monocle.  It's going to be like the magnet hair guy.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  You just keep putting shit on him.  Give him a hearing aid.  Goatee, big eyebrows.  Oh, my God.  Is that good?  A patch over his eyes.  Hey.  Oh, God.  That is so good.  Brian in the Poconos is not a fan of Steve the Whistler.  What's wrong?  What's wrong, Brian?  Good evening.  Hello.  Hey, happy birthday there, sugar nipples.  Hey, Brian.  Let's all just have a summer laugh today.  This is the guy.  We should take him and fucking get him a chimpanzee and let him go bring a cake to him. 
[01:22:30]  And let his fucking chimp get ready to rip off.  This is going great.  We'll see you guys forever.  Wow.  Brian, your concept was right there.  Yeah, I know.  You just had to execute it.  I don't know.  I lost it, but I, you know, find out I'm finally on the air.  Wait, Travis, can we please?  That was the definition of unraveling.  You know what?  You know what?  Fuck the Bombs and Flubs where it's all about us. 
[01:23:00]  We have to do a Bombs and Flubs listener version.  Listener version.  We have to because we must have enough now.  That one.  He's stuttering to chimps to chimps.  I want to hear that.  Brian, enjoy your own bomb with us.  We're going to replay your phone call.  I have to hear that.  Be quiet for a second.  Here we go.  I know.  I fucking spiraled in.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Here we go.  What, Brian?  Oh.  Here we go again.  Okay.  All right.  Fan of Steve the Whistler.  What's wrong?  What's wrong, Brian?  Good evening.  Hello. 
[01:23:30]  What's up?  Hey, happy birthday there, sugar nipples.  Hey, Brian.  Let's all just have a sour laugh today.  This is the guy.  We should take him and fucking get him a chimpanzee and let him go bring a cake to him.  Let his fucking chimp get his ribs off.  Holy shit.  This is going to me.  Now we're laughing over ourselves, laughing at Brian.  Brian, we're back live.  Oh, man.  How did you fuck that up?  Jesus.  But we never get to, you know, see the other side of these things. 
[01:24:00]  When did you know it was going horribly wrong, Brian?  Yeah.  Eh, when I started talking.  Do you know what that was?  The visual I get when I hear that is just a bird flying quickly into a window.  Yeah, they have no helmets or anything, so, you know, just smash.  Yeah.  Way to follow it up.  You're really bad at this.  Thank you, Brian.  Punch me out.  No, you didn't.  Where do you work, Brian?  What kind of job do you do? 
[01:24:30]  I drive back into lots of places and do work.  I'm a service guy.  I'm in a van right now.  What do you service?  Like, what kind of stuff?  Cars.  So you bring parts and stuff?  What's that?  You bring auto parts?  No, no.  I service cars.  I do auto parts.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Brian, from the Pocados.  Later.  Amazing.  No, don't be bummed.  You gave us a moment.  That was amazingly bad.  You want to go serious for a moment?  We got Officer Justin Barrett on Larry King. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, I'd love to hear.  This is fucking hilarious.  What a dope this guy is.  Now, what was the comment again?  He said, I don't want to misquote this.  He said, I think he said something.  It was a jungle monkey.  It was some jungle.  Banana.  Banana-eating jungle monkey, I believe.  Something like that.  As far as the Gates, you know, Crowley, Obama thing goes.  Yes.  And this other officer up there.  Really kind of blew it for everybody.  Yeah, it's like, what would you send that out to the newspaper?  What kind of...  Sent one to a columnist for the Boston Globe, and then a mass email. 
[01:25:30]  So you meant for this to be public.  It's not like this private thought was intercepted.  Right.  So here he is trying to explain this.  And last night, you had Reverend Al and Ann Coulter going at it.  Oh.  On Larry King.  Well.  They both did good, to be completely honest.  Yeah.  Al Sharpe is a good debater.  Reverend Al.  Alan annoys the piss out of me.  I don't like the guy.  I'm with you on this one, Ant.  But the guy knows how to fucking debate.  He really does.  What were they on? 
[01:26:00]  Larry King.  And what was...  It was a big TV moment there.  What was her...  What was Ann's point?  Was she defending the officer that sent the email?  Of course.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She...  Not really.  She had a tough time.  She sort of tried, but it was more about the Gates Crowley thing.  Right.  Okay.  She obviously taken Crowley's time.  And what was Reverend Al...  She'd get audio.  It'd be worth playing.  So...  I would like to hear a little Reverend Al.  All right.  Here we go.  Officer Barrett.  Justin Barrett.  Officer Barrett. 
[01:26:30]  What were you thinking?  That's actually a good question.  What were you thinking?  What were you thinking?  Yes, Larry.  I would like to take this opportunity to offer fellow police officers, soldiers, and citizens  my sincerest apology over the controversial email I authored in response to Yvonne Abraham's  editorial on the Boston Globe.  My choice of words, Larry, was lacking.  I failed to think through the perception others may have based upon what I wrote. 
[01:27:00]  I failed to realize the potential through the use of words that others would see as offensive.  I am not a racist.  I did not intend any racial bigotry, harm, or prejudice in my words.  I sincerely apologize that these words have been received as such.  I truly apologize to all involved, Larry.  That's how phony does that sound?  That was a phony written statement.  I am not a racist.  Another fake apology. 
[01:27:30]  And when you say it with a Boston accent, it really doesn't sound sincere.  Even if you mean it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you doing sending out an email, calling a guy, a junk, what are you, how out of touch  with the way things are perceived are you?  Yeah.  And again, if that was a private one that was intercepted, I would actually be on his  side because that's a private thought.  But when you send it to a columnist and you send it on a mass email, you mean for that  to be read.  You think, Justin, you deserve to be suspended based on it?  Well, Larry, if I could answer on that, on behalf of Justin. 
[01:28:00]  What is that, his lawyer?  Probably.  He lawyered up for the Larry King interview?  Yeah, of course.  There is suspension in this circumstance that needs to be addressed by an impartial body.  Is Justin willing to accept a punishment commensurate with what has occurred in a proportional  sense?  Absolutely.  You know, there's a process that does need to be followed.  And listening to some of your other guests tonight, we're talking about how, as a whole, 
[01:28:30]  this country can move on and learn from this episode that's occurred.  Justin, stepping into this event between Professor Gates and Sergeant Crowley and what has occurred  was a poor choice, poor choice of words.  It's not a well-thought-out sense of what he was doing when he did it. 
[01:29:00]  And I think that at the end of the day, the proportionality is what we need to look at.  Wait, can you look up proportionality, please?  Is that a word or is that just some dumb lawyer?  Wow, you know, that pig's got proportionality.  And Uncle Sully from Beacon Hill, he writes, he sent it over the police, the Boston Police  Computer Network.  There you go.  That's good.  So pretty much every police officer in the Boston area got this email.  But then again, because he did it like that, it's like, could he be that stupid? 
[01:29:30]  Because you couldn't think you're going to send a Jungle Monkey reference and get away  with it.  Everyone's going to see it.  So you think he's just naive?  Could he be that naive?  Could he be that?  Or he might have thought, hey, look, they can't prove I meant it in a racial way.  I didn't mention race.  He might have been trying to pull that.  We all know what I mean.  But since I'm not saying that no one can prove it thing, I don't know.  I guess proportionality is a word.  Yes, it is.  I suspect it.  Fuck. 
[01:30:00]  Officer, what upsets you so much, as you say, you're not a racist, to be so vitriolic in  the email?  Right, Larry.  He doesn't know what that word means.  Vitriolic.  Who does, though?  Come on.  Was I vitriolic?  He thinks it means something to do with winning.  I read the editorial written by Yvonne Abraham in the Globe, and it seemed like it was biased.  It did not show the roles and duties of a police officer and how dangerous it already is without 
[01:30:30]  having a debate about people getting in a police officer's face.  Which should never happen at any call.  Police officers have a dangerous job.  And I just felt that the article was one-sided and really didn't show justice to what police  officers face on a daily basis.  When they have a tough job to do, and then they have to go home to provide for their  families, and they work a lot of hours per week to provide for their families. 
[01:31:00]  What is he talking about?  Talk about trying to deflect.  Wow.  That guy is deflecting.  Not as well-spoken as Sergeant Crowley.  No, Sergeant Crowley kind of kept it together.  Yeah.  What made you come up with that language, though?  Larry, I don't even know.  I couldn't tell you.  I have no idea.  I can say that there was no intentional racial bigotry on prejudice. 
[01:31:30]  By my words, I did not intend that.  I treat people with dignity and respect.  I was in Iraq.  I work on the streets of Mattapan and Dorchester.  I work with people who are in positions that...  Dry mouth.  That's why I stopped it.  I've never heard a louder dry mouth in my life.  The thing is, what's his record show?  I don't think he should be fired for one shitty email, but...  Yeah, look at his record.  Yeah, see what his record is. 
[01:32:00]  If he has a questionable record, that's one thing.  But if he has a perfect record, it's like, eh.  Who are in positions that they're stressed out and they need help.  And I have treated people with dignity and respect on the job, off the job.  In Iraq, in the city of Boston.  That's what I've done later.  I continue to treat people with respect.  He's doing a terrible job.  He is doing a horrid job at defending himself.  If he had said something about, hey, man, we're living in a civilized society, not a jungle, 
[01:32:30]  where people, and then they misinterpret, that's one you can defend.  But you can't say a guy's a banana-eating jungle monkey, a black guy, and everyone who's  not Down syndrome-ridden understands that that's a racist reference.  So just admit that's what it is.  Why would you go on Larry King?  Well, he's trying to...  He's trying.  He didn't see this coming.  He kind of just got to hide, man.  He's stupid enough to think he could actually get on and defend that, which...  Have you used those words?  Sorry.  If he was dumb enough to send that, he's dumb enough to fucking think that there's a way 
[01:33:00]  out of it.  Yeah.  Have you used those words before, officer?  No, I've never used those words before.  Ah, well, what's with the delay?  You know what?  Is it better to say I did or not?  Hmm, I better say I didn't.  No, I never did.  Usually I just say nigger.  I never actually say jungle monkey or anything.  I usually cut right to the chase, Larry, but this was a longer email.  I want it to sound smart.  Larry.  How could you think that that's not going to be misinterpreted or interpreted accurately  as fucking...  Come on.  Yeah.  And we always defend the cops, and I'm always for a guy's right to say whatever he wants, 
[01:33:30]  but if you send out a mass email on a police department computer, fuck you think they're  going to do it?  You're a dunce.  They have to.  They're not going to be understanding.  You're a dummy.  Words hurt, guys.  Remember.  Was this in our manual?  The Words Hurt manual?  Words hurt.  And then finally.  So you were pretty angry.  Larry, Larry...  Yeah, Peter, you want to say something?  Go ahead.  Back to the lawyer.  I do.  I actually do want to speak a little more on Justin's behalf.  What do you think the lawyer was thinking as Justin Barrett was sitting there trying 
[01:34:00]  to explain all this?  Please let him have throat cancer and stop talking immediately.  Exactly.  His angst and anger that was portrayed, or actually it wasn't portrayed, it was what he  wrote in this email, was directed towards behavior.  Not well thought out, not placed well.  He's recognized the severity of what's occurred because of this.  This is a young man who's never had a disciplinary issue at all in his career and 16 years in 
[01:34:30]  the Army National Guard in the last two and a half years with the Boston Police Department.  It was probably the biggest lapse of judgment that he had and the poorest choice of words  you can make.  But this one email was making a judgment on his entire life and all of what he's doing.  I got you, Peter.  And I think he's humbled himself tonight.  He's come forward.  He's formally apologized.  I don't know what more he could do.  And maybe we could all seek a little forgiveness. 
[01:35:00]  Thanks, Justin.  Good luck.  We'll keep in touch on this.  And Peter Marano as well.  You know...  Good luck to you.  I sort of agree with the lawyer, but unfortunately we do live in a world where just one thing  fucks your life.  That's it.  It's done.  No one gives a shit.  Just because he put it out there.  It's not your whole body of work.  It's one lousy slip up and that's it for you.  How is banana eating about behavior?  Like that's what...  It's like you're trying to...  You said something really...  Everyone knows what you meant, so it's like you can't...  He's trying to equate a black gentleman with a stereotype that is very hurtful. 
[01:35:30]  And he was writing it as a cop, wasn't he?  I'm a cop you idiot.  Of course.  Judd Apatow is here.  Can we take a very quick break so we can take the leaks?  Do we have time or no?  We'll make it quick.  We promise we'll make it very quick.  Judd Apatow in a few minutes.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Lust for life.  Opie and Anthony, got to get right into it.  Judd Apatow in studio.  Very cool.  Meeting him for the first time. 
[01:36:00]  You've been watching the movies for a while and we get to finally meet you.  Great fans.  Great to be here.  Excited to be here.  Are you really excited to be here?  I don't give a shit.  Exactly.  Who are you?  Charlie Rose?  What's going on?  Where am I?  I'm tired.  What show is this?  Have you done his show, Charlie Rose?  I'm doing that this afternoon with Sandler and it shall be interesting.  I did four shows yesterday.  I did Howard Stern.  Then I went to Good Morning America.  Then to The View.  Then to The Daily Show.  And I was thinking to myself, okay, I need dick stories for Howard Stern. 
[01:36:30]  Okay, Good Morning America.  Don't do dick stories.  Got to remember, don't do dick stories.  The Daily Show.  Okay, go back to the cock.  Go back to the cock.  What about The View, though?  Well, that's all vagina.  That's all vagina.  But that had to be the toughest show to do.  What was strange about it was right before we came out, they show this piece of the Sherry  lady getting a bikini wax.  And literally, it was funny.  I have to say, it was pretty funny because it was her holding a video camera, pointing 
[01:37:00]  at herself as they ripped the hairs out of her.  But then all me and Seth did the entire time would say, you guys are as filthy as we are.  What is the difference between what we do?  And Seth kept saying, it was a lot of pulls.  That took a while to clean that up.  Can you imagine?  That's a little boy.  Yeah, she's an attractive woman, though.  Boom!  Yeah, I'm not buying that.  Yeah, Seth was in here. 
[01:37:30]  We had a lot of fun with him.  We love his stoner laugh.  He laughs his ass off all day long.  I mean, he's just freakishly funny.  I was reading a Playboy magazine interview with him.  And it was just so funny for like 10 pages.  I'm like, what planet did he come from?  How do you do that?  How do you do that?  And you're not even there.  It's just actually written.  It still looks funny.  It's not an illusion.  How did you guys get together for the first time?  I got a tape of about 100 actors from Vancouver when we were looking for the kids from Freaks  and Geeks.  And I just saw this weird dude.  And he was way weirder when he was 16. 
[01:38:00]  He was, I literally talk like this.  And he was just like, angry face.  And it made me laugh because I knew those kids in high school.  I'm sitting next to one right now.  And then I went to Vancouver and there were 500 kids auditioning.  And then we said, well, bring him in live.  And he was just this really strange, hysterical guy.  Just naturally funny.  And every day you noticed that he was even funnier than you thought.  And you would do an episode that was kind of sweet.  And you're like, oh, you kind of love this guy, even though he's the angry, funny guy. 
[01:38:30]  And then one day I just went, I think he's some kind of like new, angry, funny John Candy dude.  And the people thought I was bananas.  I tried to make him the lead on our college show, Undeclared.  And they said no in like two seconds.  Really?  I was like, what about Seth?  And they're like, what?  No way.  And so it took years to get people to see the light.  Did you see Observe and Report?  I fucking, I howled watching that movie with him and Leota. 
[01:39:00]  I think that those guys, Danny McBride and Jody Hill, they also do that show Eastbound and Down.  Oh, yeah.  Those guys are riotously funny.  I loved Observe and Report.  Yeah, we loved it too.  It just, it didn't do well, unfortunately.  But it's a great movie for people out there to check out.  And the other one, The Foot Fist Way that they made, which is on DVD.  Crazy funny.  But they go for it so harsh that, I mean, it's, you just, if you love that kind of thing where people just take it three steps past where you think they'll stop.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Those guys are the best.  Foot Fist Way.  Have you seen Foot Fist Way?  I have not seen it.  I have, but I haven't seen it.  It's great.  I just don't like the title.  It's so shallow I am a comedy star.  So did you, now, what made you laugh movie-wise?  Like, for me, I think my favorite comedy of all time, it might be Used Cars, which I remember, like, his fucking Frank McRae.  You remember Frank McRae?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The big black actor.  You never heard from him again.  Like, what kind of comedies did you watch?  Wasn't that Robert Zemeckis' first movie?  Yeah, Zemeckis.  Was it Zemeckis?  Yep, it was Zemeckis.  You know, the movie, well, I mean, I'm a big comedy fan, so I like everything, but I went and saw Young Frankenstein in a movie theater. 
[01:40:00]  Like, in a movie theater, Young Frankenstein with a packed house gets the biggest laughs of anything I've ever seen since, like, Airplane.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I like, you know, I like Harold and Maude.  I like The Last Detail, which is, like, the first great cursing Hal Ashby movie.  I think it was the first movie where people really cursed the Blue Street because it's such old Jack Nicholson.  Oh, yeah, but we are the fucking Shore Patrol.  I thought I'd see it, man.  Okay, yeah, that was great.  I've never seen that one.  I've got to check that out.  Yeah, it's an old Nicholson, right.  Yeah, right. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, I love being there.  I love you to Fast Times at Ridgemont High because it's kind of funny and it's dirty, but also it's real.  Jennifer Jason Leigh gets an abortion in the movie.  It gets kind of heavy.  So I like movies that can go both ways.  Punch Drunk Love, I love it.  We've got to get one of those abortions.  I love that guy.  I'm always like, where's that guy?  Damone.  We actually talked to him on the phone once, and I was all psyched.  It's like, oh, fuck Damone, you know, he's going to be on.  And God, what a bore.  I was a complete and utter bore. 
[01:41:00]  It didn't help that you were doing Damone to Damone.  I just wanted him to say something like, hey, Rand, would you get that out of the hamper?  You know, just throw out some fucking Damone lines.  But he's just talking about, yeah, well, I'm going to school.  How old are you?  Jesus Christ.  Did you see Punchline?  I did see Punchline, yes.  We were talking about Punchline yesterday with Seth Rogen, and I saw it, and we killed that movie.  Why?  That's just how it happens in stand-up.  That was really well done.  That's why it's so difficult for an actor to pull off being a stand-up comic, unless maybe they have that in their background. 
[01:41:30]  It's a lot easier for a stand-up comic to cross over into acting.  Although, I don't think they get the respect from the actors.  It's kind of like, oh, bring the funny man on.  Yes, I remember when Tom Hanks was going to all of the comedy clubs doing sets, and they had this comedian, Barry Sobel, was helping him do his stuff.  And, of course, he would kill at the clubs.  But the thing that drove people crazy about that movie, Comedians, was that they had lockers. 
[01:42:00]  And everyone was like, we don't have lockers in comedy clubs.  Lockers.  And so we built our set of the Comedy and Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, and we rebuilt it on a stage.  And I walk in to check out the set, and they built fucking lockers.  And I'm like, what's going on?  And they're like, there really are lockers at Comedy and Magic Club.  There's just beer cases in front of them.  And I almost had a heart attack.  I'm like, you've got to cover the lockers.  Get rid of the lockers.  Put anything more realistic, like chicks that want to fuck you.  That's kind of a fantasy, but at least we can maybe see it happening once. 
[01:42:30]  But it's so bizarre, people, when they interpret stand-up comedy.  And it's like, Sandler in this, because Sandler does stand-up.  I mean, he knows how to, you know, he's a fucking funny stand-up.  And it's like, it's about a guy who made a lot of money doing stuff, I guess, what, like hokey stuff that he wasn't happy doing?  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a funny, generic version of the modern comedy star, leaning, you know, much, much softer than Adam.  Like, what I think is kind of funny is that when he does stand-up in the movie, he's filthy, but all his movies are like Merman. 
[01:43:00]  And he has this kind of very down-the-middle comedy career.  And you could tell that he doesn't want to be Richard Pryor.  He wants to be Dangerfield.  And he just wants to tell funny jokes and dick jokes.  And when he gets sick, he doesn't want to think about the fact that he's sick, so he just pushes it down and goes on stage a ton and talks about his dick even more.  And that's something that we were going for, like, he's not going to open up.  He's going to shut down completely.  So his common character is not a guy who's kind of, like, biographical on stage. 
[01:43:30]  He just kind of goes up and does anything but what's really happening.  Yeah, every once in a while he slips and something comes out.  And there's a great scene the night that he finds out that he's sick where he goes on stage.  And just starts berating the crowd.  And he doesn't say he's sick, but we know that he's sick.  And he starts yelling at the crowd and talking about how he doesn't believe in God and how his dad always said, if there was a Holocaust, how could there be a God?  Now go to sleep, son.  Pleasant dreams. 
[01:44:00]  And his fears slip out on stage.  And that's something we've all seen a ton.  A comic go on at midnight and just lose his shit and not do his act.  I used to see Dangerfield do that.  He would get up on stage and go, sometimes life makes perfect sense.  And then you come.  And the crowd would be like, what happened to Rodney?  And he would point out women in the crowd and he would say, yeah, you would love me for who I am.  Yeah.  It would be you.  You'd change my life.  Thanks, honey.  And it was those were the great moments in clubs. 
[01:44:30]  And we tried to capture that a little bit.  Watching a comic suffer or watching a comic go down is there's no greater high for a comic than to watch another one fucking just eating his balls on stage.  You empathize because you know what it's like.  And usually they're saying funnier shit than they have in their act to you.  Always.  To the audience.  You know, it's not funny to be berated or called shit.  But to another comic, to watch a guy bomb is just fantastic.  Crash and burn, yeah.  It's fantastic to watch that.  And if you capture that somehow like a guy who's well known snapping and unraveling.  I mean, that's. 
[01:45:00]  I saw Paul Rodriguez do that one night at the improv in like 1991 where he listed everything that happened to him in his entire career and what he thought went wrong.  And it was the funniest set I've ever seen.  What did he say?  Did he just say AKA Pablo 30 times in a row?  He started talking about that.  He said, he said, he goes, you know, you know, they told me that AKA Pablo would be a hit.  It lasted as long as it takes to come.  But for like 20 minutes.  And it was riotously.  You got to love that honesty, though. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  In a comic.  Hey, why did you guys reveal that Adam Sandler was sick in the trailer?  Well, to me, the movie really is about the fact that it's kind of a nervous breakdown movie.  So the part that interested me wasn't the sick part.  Most of the movie happens after he's better.  At least, you know, I mean, I won't kind of give anything away, but he has a, you know, a remission.  And you think that he's going to like be cool and change his life like it's a, you know, like a beginning. 
[01:46:00]  Like it's one of those, you know, touchstone movies.  Hollywood ending.  Yeah.  And then suddenly he just starts losing his shit because he doesn't really want to be alive.  He, he almost preferred being sick because when he's sick, he's like, all this is bullshit.  Everything I care about is bullshit.  My career.  I have no friends.  I don't, I'm not close to my family.  And so he gets better and he's like, now what do I do?  And then he has this kind of great, you know, nervous breakdown that leads to him trying to do things that he really shouldn't do that are fucked up.  And, and that's the fun part of the movie. 
[01:46:30]  Did you do stand up ever?  I did stand up as, from like 85 to 87.  I started at Governors and Chuckles on Long Island.  Oh my God.  Oh, you're a Long Island guy?  Oh yeah.  I used to work with John Mulroney and those guys and Bob Nelson.  And, and I was not very, very good.  I finally got on like HBO Young Comedian Special with Ray Romano and people like that.  And then the Ben Stiller show got picked up and I was, I created that with Ben and I realized I'm just so not as funny as everyone I'm friends with. 
[01:47:00]  I lived with Sandler.  I was, I was, you know, you know, working for Jim Carrey, helping him out on stuff.  And I would watch Jim Carrey at the back of the room and think, I just suck.  I'm just, I'm not on the, in the same universe as this guy.  And it really shamed me out of the business.  Wow, really?  I just, cause I'm such a comedy fan and I know who, who the greats are.  I just have an eye for comedy.  And it's like, then you suddenly look in the mirror and go, it's not me.  It ain't that guy.  Oh man.  Wow.  Long Island.  I didn't know that.  What part of Long Island are you growing up? 
[01:47:30]  I grew up in like Syosset, Woodbury on the island.  Jesus.  Close.  Huntington.  And I was, I was a freak about it.  You know, I, I, when I was a kid, I was really obsessed.  So I got a job as a dishwasher at the Eastside Comedy Club when I was 15.  Richard Minervini.  Exactly.  Do you know, I had a gig at that place and I went there and the doors were padlocked.  Yeah.  It was the first club to pay me 500 bucks to middle.  And I get there and there's a fucking padlock on the door.  That's when it was over.  It was, it was done.  Yeah.  The club was closed.  Yeah.  It was great days.  I mean, it was, you know, the early eighties and I was a kid and everyone in that place 
[01:48:00]  was just coked out of their mind.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, those were the days where you could just feel that place vibrating and it would  be packed on the weekend.  Yeah.  Just mobbed with people.  Yeah.  That was the place to go on Long Island, man.  Everyone's talking about Jerry Cooney would come and Jerry Cooney's here.  Yeah.  That's right.  He was the biggest celebrity on Long Island for like 10 years.  It was all about Jerry Cooney.  Long Island zone.  Jerry Cooney.  That's where my buddy Adam, Adam Ferrara started.  Adam Ferrara, sure.  Yeah.  And Rosie O'Donnell. 
[01:48:30]  I remember the first night she went up on a weekend.  They're like, they're letting Rosie up on Saturday.  And Eddie Murphy would come in.  He was 21.  He just hit.  But he still would come in and it really annoyed everybody because they would immediately start  a bedding pool.  How long will he do?  Because everyone would get bumped all night.  Right.  And it was fantastic.  And you know Otto?  Did you know Otto and George?  Yeah.  Those guys were.  I mean, when I lived with Sandler, Sandler worked a lot in Brooklyn and Pips.  And so he was Otto and George Freak. 
[01:49:00]  And so there was a lot of discussion of things that they said to strangers in restaurants  on the road where they almost all got beaten up all the time.  You know the guy from Pips?  You know the club closed and the brothers.  One was Marty's working in Vegas and Seth shot himself.  I don't know if you know he committed suicide.  Wow.  Yeah.  Happy story.  Yeah, that keeps it fun for everyone.  Funny people this Friday.  But if he's doing a thing about a guy, a comic who had a break.  It's like Seth did do stand-up and stuff.  And it's like sometimes when you can't get the relief you need on stage, man. 
[01:49:30]  It's just guys do stuff like that.  Who was the greatest stand-up?  We always debate this on the show.  There were guys who were monsters where they could just rip the roof off the place who were  just the great pros of all time when I used to do stand-up.  I mean, I would go on the road sometimes and, well, Dennis Miller when I used to do stand-up  and, like, you would open up for Dennis Miller back in the days when I did it, would really  tear the house down.  And what was interesting is his whole act had, like, a little rhythm. 
[01:50:00]  Like, he would do really well.  And then at some point, about 20 minutes before the end, he would just kick it up a notch and  start talking faster and faster.  And by the end, the place was just going bananas.  Larry Miller.  You remember Larry?  Sure.  Very funny.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he would do, like, an hour 40, which always rocked.  He'd be like, he's on stage for, like, an hour and a half.  Like, how do you get that much material together?  But there were guys that were just fun to watch because weird stuff would happen.  Like, when Jim Carrey started doing stand-up again, he dropped all his impressions and 
[01:50:30]  he would improvise a lot of his act.  And half of it would bomb, like, really bad.  And half of it would suddenly come back and erupt and he would tear the house down.  That's what I always liked.  I like the guys that you knew they weren't sure where they were going.  God, I love those type of comics.  Love them.  I mean, I remember there was a night Jim Carrey goes to the comedy store.  He gets bumped for Kinison.  And then he gets bumped for Andrew Dice Clay.  And so now the place is, like, two hours late.  And Jim goes on at, I mean, it's probably 12. 
[01:51:00]  And he's supposed to be on at 10.  And he's not a star.  Maybe In Living Color just started.  And he was so mad that he said, I'm not getting off this fucking stage until the club is closed.  This is bullshit.  And he refused to get off the stage for, like, two and a half hours until they closed the place.  And one by one, comedians were coming in for their spots and throwing shit at the stage and yelling at him.  And that was actually, strangely, the night that he came up with Fire Marshal Bill.  He was just improvising and started just talking about, he just started doing this crazy burn victim face. 
[01:51:30]  And then started just complaining that the whole place was a fire hazard and saying, oh, there's too many plugs in that socket.  And because he was killing time, he did it for, like, 15 minutes.  Wow.  And it was pretty awesome.  So in this movie, who was, were they all comfortable doing stand-up?  I mean, Sandler, obviously.  But Seth had never done it before, had he?  Well, yes.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, Seth has done stand-up.  But from the time he was, like, 13 to 16. 
[01:52:00]  And weirdly funny.  Like, it's on YouTube.  I saw it.  I thought it would be awful.  And he's kind of good.  Like, there's something wrong with him.  That he's that good.  Jonah had a problem.  Seth was admitting yesterday that Jonah had a little problem being a stand-up.  Jonah went up the first time, and he kills.  He tells a couple of stories.  He kills.  And then the next time he went up, he just ate it so hard.  And Louis C.K. was there, and he was just ruthless in letting him know how bad it was.  Louis, he'll do that.  And then when we first shot Jonah on film, and we would bring in a real crowd, and I would tell the crowd, don't laugh if it's not funny. 
[01:52:30]  Just whatever you would do.  And Jonah started having the wide-eyed tank.  And we have it on film.  You just see it in his eyes.  Like, what's happening?  Because he doesn't really know what he's doing.  And then I'm finally just yelling out, like, Jonah, it's a movie.  Just act like you're doing well.  But it was fun to watch him go down in flames.  I'm actually writing a movie about a guy.  Like, there's a bomb in the White House, and he has to save the president. 
[01:53:00]  Is there anything worse when people give you shitty movie pictures?  I love that.  But he comes in, right?  And the guy's like, no, you can't come in.  There's no bomb here.  How long have you been working on that movie?  Yeah, a long time.  You keep freaking up.  Yeah, I'm trying to come up with, like, a really good phrase for the trailer.  I'll tell you a funny story, a Colin Quinn story.  I was having lunch with Colin Quinn.  We're in with Jim Carrey and our manager, Jimmy Miller.  And Colin Quinn comes into the place.  And as a joke, he starts pitching Jim a movie. 
[01:53:30]  But he does it in such a way that you can't quite tell if he's joking.  Oh, no.  And does it for a really long time.  And it was really, really disturbing.  How awful was the movie concept?  You know what?  It was just close enough that, like, you couldn't call on it being a joke.  Right, right.  That's good.  I hope it was real.  And I bet you deep down, Colin kind of didn't know if it would be received as one.  And it was one he had probably worked on for a little while and not quite finished.  Oh, no, no.  I think you might like it.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[01:54:00]  And then a guy comes up and talks to the guy.  We love when Colin does our show.  Colin's a good friend.  So you have fucking nothing but hits, dude.  And I'm not saying that because I'd love to be in one.  I mean, who gives a shit about me?  It's more about you and the movies you do.  And, dude, you have, like, had no bomb.  It's like hit after hit after hit.  You know, I get credit for a lot of stuff that I didn't do.  The one thing that I do do is I put together people that I just think will work well together.  I mean, I definitely try to help everyone with their scripts.  But it's more like a TV show writer's room. 
[01:54:30]  If someone has a draft of a movie, then we sit and we table it and we read it out loud.  But I feel bad that people give me credit for some of the things.  But I just wasn't even there.  You know, like, you know, I mean, I worked very hard for a long time with Seth on Pineapple Express and, you know, making sure the script was right.  But, like, David Gordon Green, the guy who directed that, who directed, like, a lot of Eastbound and Down and did all the real girls.  A great director.  But he just kicked the shit out of it. 
[01:55:00]  I mean, the guy just, you know, so then when people talk about it all like Judd movies, I'm just, I want to crawl under a rock, you know?  That's got to be nice, though, man.  It's like you started doing stand-up and, like, your name is the one they're associating with great comedies.  I mean, that's got to be a great feeling to, like, to know you're contributing on that level to comedy.  I mean, it's just got to be nice.  Well, just as a fan, it's nice to get guys that you know are funny their own opportunities.  Like, if someone had a movie about the White House, maybe at some point it would get done.  I do, but the problem is it's a nuclear weapon. 
[01:55:30]  And they won't let me in because they don't think that I know.  But I finally get in.  I save everybody.  It's a long story.  It's very good.  Yeah.  It's a very good movie.  How did you get into directing, though?  Like, you can't just dive right in and go, I know how to direct.  Well, here's the thing.  I had no interest in making movies.  I only wanted to be Seinfeld or Leno since I was, like, 15.  When I first saw them on TV, when they first started, I just wanted to be one of those guys. 
[01:56:00]  So I never paid attention to movies.  I wasn't one of those kids, like, looking at the shots who knew, like, the cinematography.  I just was like, stripes is funny.  And that was it.  So as I started writing for other comics, because my act wasn't as good as the jokes I was writing for other people, I would get a chance to produce things.  But I never wanted to direct, because I had this nightmare that none of the eyelines would match.  And just somehow I would screw it up.  It seems very difficult.  It seems like a difficult job.  And the thing is, I didn't realize that the cinematographer makes sure you don't screw it up visually. 
[01:56:30]  But I was scared.  And so I was at the Larry Sanders show writing over there, and I was working on an episode about a psychic.  And so we bring in this woman who's a psychic, Char.  And I thought, okay, well, this will be funny.  I'll bring her to the office and let her, like, read everybody.  And then I'll know what the Larry Sanders people would do if someone read them.  And she comes in, and she starts reading people.  And it's all so accurate. 
[01:57:00]  It's freaking people out.  Jon Stewart was on the show and writing then.  And she just said, you know, this, this, this, and this.  And he just, like, almost shit his pants.  And it was weird stuff, like walking up to a person going, like, you're about to get married.  Her name starts with a Z, Zoe.  And you're like, it's not even, like, Bill or something.  I mean, she's, so then at the end of it, she just says to me, you're going to direct very soon.  And you're going to have some sort of flood at your house.  Get out of here.  And literally two weeks later, Shandling said, hey, you should do an episode before the series ends. 
[01:57:30]  And I had a little flood at my house.  And I was scared shitless to do it.  Wow, that's freaky.  And then I, you know, and when I did it, you know, it's Rip Torn.  You know, like, you're directing Rip Torn and Jeffrey Tambor and Gary.  They're hardcore.  And I've known them for five years.  But still, I'm scared to death.  And Rip Torn, you know, he's tough.  You know, he's not an easy person to give notes to.  He's been around, you know, for a very long time. 
[01:58:00]  And so I was, I tiptoed through the episode and it came out well.  And then I thought, okay, I guess I can't be a pussy anymore.  I should try to do this.  I can do this.  What do you do if that happens?  Because, like, if you're directing and there's an actor on who's a major, like, now you're at a point where you could probably tell anybody anything.  But it's like when you first start out, your first or second film, how do you tell a guy, like, you're really missing the joke?  A guy who's probably not going to receive that.  And with no experience, you know, you don't have that respect built up.  That's why I hire 15-year-olds.  I don't listen to anything. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, I mean, you basically take someone out of high school.  They will listen to you.  And that's not actually that much of a joke.  But there are people, and I saw it at Larry Sanders all the time, who would show up and just kind of resist what we were doing.  And then other people who would embrace it and it would be great.  A lot of actors, what they try to do is they try to direct the movie themselves through their performance.  And you'll ask them to do something and they'll say, no, because if I do that, you might use it. 
[01:59:00]  And the great thing about Sandler was there wasn't one second in that entire shoot where he ever said, don't do that, that'll make me look bad.  Or don't do that, people will think I'm the character.  He just said, what do you want me to do?  And he did it every time in editing.  He never said, hey, man, cut that joke, man.  That makes me look like an asshole.  And I was, you know, we've been friends for 20 years.  But I thought, you know, Sandler's a big star.  He runs his own ship.  At some point, we're going to go to war in the middle of this movie.  And it's going to get uncomfortable. 
[01:59:30]  And he just said, I'm going to put myself in your hands and good luck.  And that's exactly what he did.  So you were roommates?  Yeah, we were roommates.  And was that during the time with MTV when he was doing remote control?  It was right when he was doing remote control.  He had three big claims to fame.  He was a stud boy on remote control with Colin.  And he had done like five episodes of the Cosby show as one of Theo's friends.  And he'd walk in and have two lines. 
[02:00:00]  That's hilarious.  And occasionally he would VJ, which really, you know, back then, VJ on MTV.  Yeah, that was the golden ring.  And everyone felt like Sandler's going to take off.  It was just one of those things.  Every once in a while, there's just a guy.  And you just go, it's that guy.  He's the guy.  So being roommates with him, at that point, where was your career?  I was emceeing into improv like five nights a week.  So I would do my eight minutes at the beginning of the night and then try to sneak a joke in in between acts. 
[02:00:30]  And, you know, L.A. is a terrible place to be a mediocre comic and try to develop.  It's just an awful atmosphere.  But I was beginning to, you know, get a little bit of work.  But I was depressed living with him.  Was there jealousy and stuff where you're like, God damn, the guy's on TV.  Even though, you know, looking back and how far he did come in show business, you look back at like MTV and doing stuff like that.  It was kind of silly.  I mean, I, you know, I loved him.  There was nothing about him that wasn't super positive about what I was doing. 
[02:01:00]  I mean, he couldn't have been more supportive of me and I was not good.  And he always talked to me like I was good.  So I never had that kind of angry jealousy.  But I did think to myself, this is he has everything I don't have on TV.  Yeah.  And it was beyond that.  It was like, you know, I've never really seen it before.  He would walk into a room of strangers as a 22-year-old knucklehead.  And if you stayed for an hour, like you just felt the room move towards him. 
[02:01:30]  And he was funny.  And he was not a loud guy.  I mean, the fame wasn't the thing that made people interested in him.  He just had this kind of really, this weird Brooklyn-y spark about him.  And he, I did use, I mean, when's the earliest you saw Sandler in the clubs?  I've never seen him in a club.  He walked into the improv one night probably three years ago when I was there.  But I've never actually seen him do Santa Blythe.  I mean, and on stage, never did great, but was crazy funny and would bomb half the time. 
[02:02:00]  And if he bombed, he would go harder at the crowd or get dirtier.  He seemed to enjoy like when it went weird.  And I did a lot of drinking as a result of it.  I remember sitting at the apartment drinking Southern Comfort and kind of realizing like,  it's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  Well, would he be really supportive or would it just be like, I know I'm doing better than you support?  Like you'd come home and go, this guy spilled a beer and I had some good improv.  He's like, really?  That must have been fun.  There's nothing worse than when a guy's doing better than you when he's kind of being supportive,  but you know it's just polite support.  You want to spit on him. 
[02:02:30]  I got to ask you about Knocked Up.  I love the movie like everyone else.  And I'm obsessed with this.  Why didn't Katherine Heigl get topless?  That's all I want to know.  That's true.  I need to know the answer to that because that movie was so wild.  And there they're having those sex scenes with her with the bra on.  There's nothing worse either than sex with the bra on.  Well, it's a guy's movie.  That's why I show his ass.  I'm like, I got to show some skin somewhere.  At least I'm showing the baby come out of her vagina later.  But yes, clearly, if that was the situation, that character, Ben, would have gotten the bra off. 
[02:03:00]  That would have been a priority, I think, in that scene.  There was obviously something going on behind the scenes.  I think Seth said yesterday that she had a really good lawyer or a better lawyer than me or something.  You know, I'm not the kind of guy that pushes really hard for that.  Maybe I should have, but I just at the time thought, if she doesn't want to do it, I don't know.  I'm not going to push hard.  I don't know if she ever has before. 
[02:03:30]  It is a weird thing to push on people.  When we shot the scene in The Forty Old Virgin where Carell's on a speed date and the woman's boob pops out.  First of all, the woman, I don't know if this is correct, but she seemed very comfortable with her boobs popping out.  And maybe at some point in her life had done some sort of work where that was part of it.  But I treated her like she was Lady Diana or something.  I just was so scared and did like one take and I was so uncomfortable going, okay, now let it pop out. 
[02:04:00]  So I'm not great in those situations.  But you have to respect people's feelings about what they want to show.  Didn't she come out and say that the movie was sexist or something I remember reading?  Well, on the cover of Vanity Fair, it said that she thought that the movie was a little sexist.  And she thought we made guys look goofy and lovable.  And the women were portrayed as shrews.  And, you know, it's hard to judge what that's all about because when you do a cover story, they probably meet with you several times and talk for like five, six hours. 
[02:04:30]  And you can get tired and slip and just go a little farther than you mean.  Or she completely means it and has an issue.  You were not thrilled about it because, if anything, the movie is about what idiots guys are and how it drives women crazy.  And, you know, the guy who grabs his bong before his pregnant girlfriend when there's an earthquake, you know, we're making fun of the guy.  We're not making fun of the girl.  But there's something I never see in movies, which is women scream at you. 
[02:05:00]  Women motherfuck you.  And when you fight, it's ugly.  And I thought, Catherine Keener was so funny yelling in Forty Old Virgin.  I just wanted to show a different kind of relationship conflict and let it just go to ten and have them, like, motherfuck each other.  And so, you know, I think some people were thrown because it's not like a Sandra Bullock romantic comedy.  Those are good, though.  Let's be honest.  I always laugh like Mahatma Conehy together. 
[02:05:30]  So, you know, she said, go fuck your bong and all that stuff.  So, I don't know.  I mean, I know where my heart is.  And I love guys being immature and stupid and to see couples not communicate well.  Who wants to see people get along?  I mean, that's the point for me.  What do you hate in comedy?  I just hate it when I can tell they made a movie just because they want to make money.  You know, you can tell there are certain movies they just feel like something was packaged.  They're high concepts for no reason. 
[02:06:00]  And when I first started working, there was a lot more of those.  Like, if we could get this idea and this guy, we could make a movie.  And I like any movie where I think, it's like music, too.  Like, that guy's not screwing around.  That guy has something to say.  Even if it's silly, you know, like when we did a – I produced Anchorman.  And when Will Ferrell and Adam McKay wrote that and Adam directed it, it was a silly movie.  But it was just the world – they were so passionate about it. 
[02:06:30]  And it was so original that, you know, you adore it.  And it is one of the funniest movies ever.  But most movies aren't made with that kind of care.  I think you're downplaying it.  You brought back the comedy to where it should be, Judd.  I mean, before your movie started popping up, we were frustrated by what they were throwing at us, right?  People weren't talking about comedies just like in daily conversation.  But honestly, with your stuff, people are just – it's just common talk.  Your films are mentioned along with whatever drama is out.  People weren't talking about comedy just a long time. 
[02:07:00]  Years ago, it was.  You really get the credit for bringing it back.  I'm telling you.  During the 80s, I mean, comedy had the thing with, you know, airplane.  And then all that went away for a good decade, right?  Yeah, then it just kind of went away.  And it's refreshing to see, you know, tits and sex talk and dirty language and shit like that.  Because for so long, it turned into these just milk-toasty romantic comedies.  We talk about it all the time with the cover of the video box of the guy and the girl standing back to back. 
[02:07:30]  And it's like, oh, he's quite the – what a guy he is.  Look out for him.  And the girl's like, well, I'll teach him.  I'm going to –  She has the business suit on and he's holding a beer.  Uh-oh, smart gal alert.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No one laughs at that shit.  I hate – I can't – I used to – when I used to rent videos, walk through Blockbuster  and hate movies just based on the cover.  I just knew nothing about them.  And I'm like, I hate this because of the cover. 
[02:08:00]  I couldn't even look at it.  Like, I get these douchey –  Well, we got them up on our screen right now for everybody to enjoy.  Oh, there's one.  There's a montage of these where they're just back-to-back.  Well, you know, the – you know, my friend, Jack Garaputo, who produced the funny people  for us, he said that – his theory was that when they invented the PG-13 rating, which  they invented it because of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which they thought was  too scary for a PG.  And what happened was all those movies we used to love, like Animal House, even I think 
[02:08:30]  Blues Brothers and The Jerk, I think most of those were R-rated comedies.  And so when you got the PG-13 rating, suddenly people said, don't make R-rated because we  want everyone up to the age of, whatever, 13 to 18 to be able to get in without their  parents.  And so no one would make R-rated movies except for, like, the occasional great one, like  something about Mary or Clerks or something.  Most movies were pushed into the middle.  And when we started, it was a fight to say, no, we've got to do the 40-year-old Virgin R. 
[02:09:00]  We have to do Superbad R.  Good for you.  And – because they said – they had math, like, R-rated movies succeed this percentage  of the time.  PG-13 movies make money.  That's great when you bring math into it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And we were like, no, your math doesn't matter because if you water it down and it sucks,  it doesn't matter if you can make a PG-13.  And so as a result – and a lot of this is from Seth.  Seth was the biggest proponent of make people talk the way me and my friends talk.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:09:30]  There's nothing worse than watered-down comedy.  It's horrendous.  It's not natural.  You know, you and your friends are horrible to each other.  You know, you sit here and you badmouth them.  You curse.  You know, you're just nasty to them.  That's how people are.  That's how you are with your best friend.  The way it's portrayed on movies where they're not using foul language, they're not treating  each other in awful, horrible ways like you do your best friend.  It's phony.  There are times where you can't – like, you know, a kid's movie.  You know what I mean?  It's like, all right, fine. 
[02:10:00]  But if it's going to be an adult comedy, fucking talk like adults.  Like the old days, I watched Porky's, you know?  Yeah.  And you're just seeing, like, tits and ass and shit like that.  You know, big hairy bushes in the shower.  Jesus.  But, you know, that was like – that's the comedies I grew up with.  Yeah.  And they disappeared for so long.  A long time.  Yeah.  No, it's great that it's encouraged.  Because when you have an R, what the studio says is, well, if you're going to have an R,  you better have a hard R because there's no point in having an R unless you really use 
[02:10:30]  it.  Go on.  Yeah.  And so you get a different argument, which is, can you add more dirty stuff to the movie?  Yeah, yeah.  Why is this person dressed at this moment?  Superbad was hysterical, man.  I was like – I watched that.  Each time I watch it, you just laugh more, I think.  It's one of those movies that's just – they're so fucking funny together, just treating each  other poorly.  Oh, Seth – I mean, Seth showed me that script, I mean, back in 2001.  Jesus.  And I read it, and I thought, you know, this is kind of as funny as it gets. 
[02:11:00]  So we refused to give up on it, and I kept having Seth and his partner Evan rewrite it  because I thought at some point someone's going to give us the money to do this.  But also we thought the whole time, are they really going to let us make a movie with  a big period blood on your pants?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, is it possible that this will happen?  To the point where I kept saying to the guys, when you shoot it, just make sure there's  a way to remove this, like logically, if you had to.  If you have to.  Or if the crowd just goes, no.  And then we had our first screening in front of a big crowd, and the place went crazy. 
[02:11:30]  And I was like, I can't believe we can keep the crazy period blood sequence in the movie.  And the kid drawing the dicks, I mean.  Yeah.  Holy.  That was in the first draft.  And when I read the movie, I was like, okay, I mean, you've got to make the movie just for  this.  Yeah.  Just the montage of dicks.  And Greg Mottola, who directed this, who also did Adventureland, he's just a brilliant  guy.  He made this movie, The Day Trippers, also, which is fantastic.  And this is another example. 
[02:12:00]  Someone who directs so well, you just want to make sure everybody knows that's why the  movie works.  Because in addition to the filth, you really care about the guys.  And the movie is about two guys breaking up because they're going to different colleges  and how panicked they are to not have each other.  Yeah.  And that's why people like it.  You know what's funny about the, bring out the period scene?  It isn't even so much when he first gets it.  When he gets to the party later, and it's a quick scene where he's just being that funny  guy.  And there's no, you can't hear any dialogue, but he points to it. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  And like, makes like what was happening and makes everybody laugh.  Just him bringing it back to the period blood thing.  It's just fucking hysterical, man.  What do you think about great comedies being remade?  We talk about this a lot on our show.  I'm not a fan of that.  Thank God.  Occasionally, I get the call, you know, do you want to remake the party?  Or do you want to remake whatever?  And I always think, I don't know.  I mean, first of all, why?  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, anyone who likes comedy should go, you know, watch Harold and Maude. 
[02:13:00]  I don't need to go do the new version of it with a cast member from CSI or something.  And The In-Laws is a great example.  Why would you ever remake The In-Laws?  I mean, you have to be really out of ideas to get to that place.  There's very few of those movies which seem like they are begging for reinvention.  Except maybe The Pink Panther, because I don't think Sellers did a very good job.  I think the Steve Martin version is more enjoyable. 
[02:13:30]  Peter Sellers was kind of overrated, but Steve Martin is the funny muster.  I do laugh watching that.  It's an injustice.  I don't know if Judd is going to comment, but it's an injustice to Peter Sellers.  This is Jim Norton saying, it's the worst thing I've ever heard.  It really frustrated us that those were remade.  It's like, what are you doing?  You don't need to remake those movies.  Because in a weird way, there's a tribute, and then there's out and out taking something.  If I go on stage and I start doing Kenison's act, I'm stealing from Kenison.  I'm stealing from Kenison.  So it's almost like if you're doing the same, if you steal a guy's character and redo it, 
[02:14:00]  it's like you're stealing it.  It's not a tribute.  And I get some of it is that, I mean, people, I guess there's a funny cycle happening now  where literally they're going to start remaking movies from the early 90s or the late 80s.  It's like the cycle of how fast they'll remake a movie is really kind of insane.  How quickly they go, is it, you know, is it, can we do True Lies now?  And it's fast. 
[02:14:30]  It's happening really fast.  Because also it takes a long time to develop them.  So they'll literally, you know, right now just start saying, can we remake Taken?  Should we get that going?  Yes.  Quick, get some soy sauce to dye that hair with.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's like, it's like, the fucking hairdo is horrendous.  It's the worst.  It really is.  It's a lack of creativity.  It's fucking lazy.  It's like people aren't coming up with anything original.  No one's taking risks.  It's just like to remake the honeymooners just to put black people. 
[02:15:00]  What are you guys doing?  Mike Epp's a funny guy.  Cedric's a funny guy.  They don't need to do that shit.  I prefer the odd couple with the female cast.  Ew, did they do that?  They did do that.  They did?  What?  Yes, they did.  Who was in that one?  Yeah, I do.  One of them might have been Sally Struthers.  Oof.  Wow.  Was it her and a skinny girl?  It could have been like 25 years ago.  All right.  It wasn't recently.  Yeah.  Yeah, still, exactly.  Because they're re-backing The Jerk, I heard.  Are they redoing The Jerk?  I mean, I think basically what happens at some point is the studios just own the titles and 
[02:15:30]  they don't pump new life into them or whatever.  They may not even need permission from the people who made the great version to do it  again.  You know, they just will one day just call you and go like, no, no, we're redoing it.  And we love old Steve Martin.  I mean, The Jerk was a great fucking comedy.  Amazing.  Well, he is the king.  I mean, he is the king.  Amazing.  And we're confused.  Why would he even, you know, agree to do The Pink Panther when he could do so much else?  I, I, it's a...  It's a nice check.  There's not a lot.  I mean...  I guess.  I mean, who knows?  I mean, people, uh...  I mean, people want to challenge themselves and see what they can figure out. 
[02:16:00]  And there have been things that have been redone.  Well, Tarzan.  They did Tarzan.  They just get a new guy.  And every once in a while, someone does knock one of those out of the park.  But it's really rare.  We understand some movies because the special effects and all that get better.  So it's like, yeah, we could really...  King Kong was a great...  Kong was a smart remake.  We could enhance...  Well, we could remake something from like 1939 or something.  Well, from the 70s either.  I mean, from the 77 Jeff Bridges version.  That's when we get it, though, when you can make it better in that way.  Yeah, it's hard on the comedy.  Yeah, exactly.  Also, so many of those comedies are of the time. 
[02:16:30]  And so much about what we liked about them was when the culture was completely different.  And the premise falls apart when suddenly there's cell phones and the internet.  And the story falls apart because like...  But they could have just emailed each other.  Yeah, yeah.  Like Superbad was...  We kept saying, do we acknowledge email?  Do we...  And so we have the one scene where Michael Cera's on his cell phone and he has bad service.  Yeah, yeah.  Motherfucker.  And he's like...  There we go.  What?  You bitch.  You fucking...  We also... 
[02:17:00]  We talk about technology in movies.  The famous one, Wall Street, where he's walking on the beach with that fucking massive...  Giant brick.  It takes out of the movie.  He's holding a Volkswagen in his hands.  You should see this past my giant cell phone, buddy.  It completely takes out of the film.  Look, there's a picture.  Danny finds it immediately.  Look at the pictures here, right?  That is great, man.  I always worry that, you know, what I put in a movie, like the phone, in a few years, it  would just be a joke because the phone is now implanted in our head or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  It's like, remember when you held them? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  I mean, it can't help but I guess, but whatever.  Yeah, there were certain things that just date a movie where you go back and watch it  and go, ooh, god damn, that didn't hold up.  And we have pop culture references.  And so we go, okay, we're referencing Lost or a band.  And we just think...  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I just saw the sign there and said, Jeff, that's five minutes, but I'm just going  to be honest with you.  I have nowhere to go.  I'm just going to sit here and just watch Andrew Dice Clay.  They, by the way, if you want to hang around, we'd love to have you.  No pressure, but...  I want to hang around.  Dice is coming in in ten minutes and trust me, we need all the help we can get. 
[02:18:00]  My wife is asleep.  I have nowhere to go.  We love the guy, but...  Wow, the whole room has to stop for Dice.  And what they do while we're on the remakes...  Well, here's where the crime is committed, is where they soften them.  Like, in the Bad News Bears, if they didn't allow Thornton to drive around with a beer  like Matha, it's like, you can't soften them and expect them to have the same...  Holy shit, that's another one where you hate it.  That's right.  You can never politically correct them up.  All the kids are drinking what?  What was it?  Pepsi or Coke in the car?  Like, the famous scene, they're all drinking beer together.  Yeah.  So then just don't remake the movie if you don't want to go down that road. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's what used to happen when we did our TV show, Undeclared, about college,  and we weren't allowed to show people drinking liquor, so everyone was holding red cups in  every scene.  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.  So those are the kind of concessions that just hurt you deep inside.  It does, right?  Or they would have to puke every time they drank.  Oh, yeah.  To make it look bad.  No one had a good experience with a beer in college?  No one ever had fun drinking in college.  And I used to always say, isn't the whole 70s show predicated on the fact that they're  high constantly?  They're smoking pot.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're like, no, but the audience, they understand that now, so it's not a big deal. 
[02:19:00]  I'm like, so I just had to get them used to the fact that our kids are drunk.  Yeah.  So what was the network people giving you, they were just giving you little notes going,  yeah, you know, we just don't.  The worst note I got, which kind of offended me, was somebody said, we need more eye candy.  And I was like, oh, I feel dirty.  I got to go in the shower.  Exactly.  Like, really?  You guys don't think Jason Segel's eye candy?  What's going on?  We should take a break. 
[02:19:30]  So if Judd's not here, I hope you hang around.  I'm going to stay.  Oh, great.  Judd will stay.  I want to talk the old days with Dice.  Dice is coming in shortly.  I didn't know he was from Long Island.  That is so cool for us.  I used to watch him.  You're a Jersey boy.  I used to watch him when he used to just do impressions of Henry Winkler.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  In the mid-80s, right?  Yeah.  Well, let's promote funny people.  We're all going to check it out.  Roland, who's here, one of our guys, he is just raving about funny people.  Unfortunately, he's the only one that's seen the movie so far.  We couldn't get to any of the screenings for whatever reason. 
[02:20:00]  But Roland's saying this movie's great.  Funny people in theaters today.  We're going to continue with Judd Apatow, and Dice is coming in.  I haven't seen Andrew in a while.  I'm happy he's coming.  I think we're going to go backstage with ONA, Bobo's boner thing.  You don't know what this is about, Judd.  It's okay.  I'm excited, though.  I'm excited.  If you want, we can explain it to you after the break if you care.  But if not, no worries.  We go backstage with Sam Roberts.  And now, backstage with ONA.  Here is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[02:20:30]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  And when we last heard from ONA show freak, Bobo, he was on the air displaying his ability  to quickly gain, lose, and regain an erection.  We found Bobo after his appearance and helped him collect his thoughts.  Bobo, what happened on the show today?  Oh, let's just say they're making me watch porn.  Just be trying to see how long they could hold a stiffy.  How long did you hold it for?  I think I held it the whole portion of the show. 
[02:21:00]  What was your inspiration?  A bunch of porn and me and Christina.  So you were thinking about Christina, and that's what helped you kind of stay erect for so long?  Yeah.  What about Bobby Lee blowing on your penis?  That causes shrinkage.  It didn't look like it caused any shrinkage.  Yeah, but over time it does.  Based on today's performance, how long do you honestly think you could last?  Because today you didn't even touch it. 
[02:21:30]  Well, I could probably last two hours.  By two hours, do you mean like 37 seconds?  No, I mean two hours.  As Bobo gets creepier and creepier by the second,  we caught up with the girl who has him thinking he's in love with her,  Christina, to see what she thought of the segment.  Christina, did you get a chance to hear Bobo on the show?  I did.  What did you think?  Um, well, I'm a little scared.  Bobo credits, uh, thoughts of you for his ability to maintain an erection for an hour. 
[02:22:00]  Uh, is that something you're flattered by?  That's what scares me, actually.  Really?  Yeah, a little bit.  So you don't find it exciting that he can get an erection, lose it, get it, lose it,  all within 30 seconds?  I'm excited for him about that, but I'm not excited for myself.  Do you think that maybe you're in over your head?  Um, maybe just a little bit after, after hearing the show and hearing, uh, you know,  what he's capable of, I think, yeah, maybe, a little. 
[02:22:30]  As Christina tries to stay in good humor while she fears a murder rate could be right around  the corner, we wonder what Bobo will do next.  Remember, Bobo, it's all laughs until you break a restraining order.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Oh, my God, we're having so much fun with Judd Apatow, who decided to just hang. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, the interview technically is over.  He's like, hey, I'm having fun.  I don't have nothing to do.  I want to hang with you guys.  And that is, like, the coolest thing, where we sit, Judd.  Well, can I answer a question that he asked me?  Well, let's just get the plug in.  Funny People, of course, is the movie that you don't even need to really promote.  Everyone's going to go see it with Adam Sandler and Jonah Hill, and Seth Rogen opens today  in theaters.  Roland has wandered around, and he said, this movie's great.  So I'm very excited.  Well, off, Joe was saying to me, Jim, where are you performing this weekend?  And I said, you know, I don't want to plug. 
[02:23:30]  It's not about that, but fuck it.  I mean, since he asked.  Manhattan Comedy Club in Middletown, New York.  It's not in New York City.  How many fucking idiots have emailed me?  Is it next to Gotham?  No, it's 40 minutes north of New York.  I wouldn't call them idiots.  The name of the club is Manhattan Comedy Club.  I know.  I'd still call them idiots, though, but they are boobs.  8, 10, 30, tonight and tomorrow.  They're fucking fools.  I don't even know what to do.  We just did 20 minutes with Judd Apatow while you guys were listening to horse shit commercials.  Yeah, sorry.  We have something in common, and I was actually very happy to hear it.  I'm not the only starstruck person. 
[02:24:00]  You take pictures with all the celebrities like Jimmy does?  And autographs and stuff?  Well, nothing makes me happy.  I took a picture with Meryl Streep when I did Conan last week.  Oh, yeah.  I got a great picture with Dr. Phil recently when my wife was on The Tonight Show.  What was he doing?  Was he applying to practice medicine in California?  I just think it's fun.  For me, it's just a funny kind of record of just where I was.  My brain is mush.  I remember nothing.  Like, I'm shocked at how fast everything is dropping out. 
[02:24:30]  I need to record it like a memento or something.  Right, right, right, right.  Who's the best one you got that you were happiest to get?  Well, of people that I've met, I mean, it's always like you're heroes.  When I was young, I was hanging out outside a theater after seeing Elvis Costello, and he happened to walk out.  And, you know, when I was 20 years old, that blew my mind to just, like, suddenly we're all sitting there talking to Elvis Costello.  But I like to buy letters like W.C. Fields' letters or Groucho Marx' letters because they were funny as hell. 
[02:25:00]  I was reading this letter that Groucho wrote thanking Jackie Gleason for having him on his show.  Wow.  And half the letter was these, like, was him insulting Jackie Gleason.  Yeah, thank you for having me on the show.  It's great that a portly fellow such as you can be so nice.  And then every other line was a fat joke.  And you forget how funny these guys are.  Yeah, and they were kind of pricks, too. 
[02:25:30]  It's funny because I showed funny people.  I was showing a hunk of it to Chris Rock.  And we were talking about Adam's character in the movie.  And there's a funny scene where he has sex with this woman.  He's with Seth, and Seth's hitting on one girl, and Adam's hitting on another girl.  So Adam has sex with his girl.  Then he walks in the room, and it's clear that Seth isn't making any progress.  And then he kind of quickly hits on that girl and then has sex with her in the same night.  And I was talking about that with Chris Rock.  And I said, you know, but the older guys, they were like that. 
[02:26:00]  Jerry Lewis and Milton Berle.  These guys, they were like cocksmen back in the day.  And then Rock was like, they were worse.  There was no TMZ.  There weren't people tracking them.  All those guys, the Rat Pack.  I mean, they were getting in some major trouble back then.  Yeah, and there was nobody, you know, a photographer with one of those cameras is going to be behind a wall somewhere.  Or they would have the mafia beat him up if they wrote about it.  What one celebrity photo you would love to get that you haven't gotten yet? 
[02:26:30]  Is there one big photo?  So, you know, I'm trying to think, you know, who you wish that you could meet.  I don't know.  You know, one of those guys that you never see anywhere is Eddie Murphy.  Yeah.  He's just not around.  And I remember when, you know, when I was young, like, he was the god.  And clearly now, as funny as ever, and you know he's one of those guys, at any moment will rip out the greatest thing that's ever been done. 
[02:27:00]  You're just waiting for the moment when it all lines up.  So, I don't know.  He's one of the few guys that you're just not exposed to.  Letterman.  You don't see Letterman.  Yeah, true.  I mean, unless you're on the show, he's not a guy you'll bump into at a bar or something.  I was on the show, and I still don't think he'd recognize me.  I've done his show twice.  I don't think he'd recognize me if he walked in the room right now.  He just, he shakes your hand.  He goes, thank you.  And Jimmy would try to get a photo after his appearance on Letterman.  We were kind of in the stairwell area because we were told that he's going to walk up these stairs. 
[02:27:30]  So, we kind of hung out, and everyone's saying, please, please don't ask for a picture.  Please.  I'll get fired.  I'll get fired.  Please don't do it.  I shook his hand.  I thanked him for having me on, and I didn't ask him.  And he walked up these stairs, and they say he just disappears in this weird, like, catacomb of hallways and rooms,  and they don't really know where he goes in the building after the show.  Only a few people know where he's at.  And I think what happens is that, you know, that type of, you know, when you treat people like that,  you forget that if he said, you want to take a picture, Letterman probably would be happy to do it. 
[02:28:00]  I bet he would say yes.  It's just so many years of telling you, like, just he's tired.  He just did the show Leave Him Alone, which is the right philosophy.  Just leave the guy alone.  He's exhausted.  He just ate ten candy bars before the show.  He's there, go relax.  But you can hear that sometimes, like, don't look that guy in the eye.  You know, and there's that joke with, like, celebrities, like, don't look him in the eye.  But really what it is is they're focusing, they're an actor, they're trying to stay in character.  Just don't distract them.  But then it turns into this legendary thing.  This thing where, yeah, yeah.  You can never look at whoever. 
[02:28:30]  Well, we looked at the Dalai Lama right in the eye in Atlanta at the Ritz-Carlton.  Well, yeah, yeah.  It was in the elevator.  We took an elevator with the Dalai Lama, and we stared right into his eyes.  You're supposed to look at him or something, right?  I guess you're not supposed to look in his eye.  I don't know.  You're supposed to look in his eyes?  I don't know.  We didn't know.  I remember years ago, we were doing comic relief.  You've been part of every fucking thing.  It's amazing.  It's ridiculous.  It was actually my first job.  I was, you know, like the intern.  My job was to get an autograph from everybody on the whole show. 
[02:29:00]  And so I had to, like, hunt down Jerry Lewis and just, like, find their dressing rooms.  It was, like, 60 people.  I hear Jerry is a real treat.  Well, the funny thing is, Jerry is, like, walking to take pictures, and all the photographers move.  And then one photographer just falls so hard, like, really hard.  And then Jerry Lewis just looks at him and he goes, and then the person jumps up.  Like, they fall hard.  Bam!  And they're up.  And Jerry goes, you're supposed to fall, wait for the laugh, then get up. 
[02:29:30]  That's great.  But I remember stuttering John, like, back in the day, invaded someplace, and he said to the Dalai Lama, you know, do you mind if when people see you, they say, hello, Dalai?  Yeah, yeah.  And Richard Gere was there.  And Richard Gere panics, like, we must kick this guy out, and goes into this rage.  And the Dalai Lama couldn't have looked more peaceful and could care less.  And I'll tell you a funny story about a Buddhist monk.  I'm shooting the scene where the baby comes out of the vagina and knocked up. 
[02:30:00]  And it's a prosthetic advice, and it's on it like an extra.  And the head just comes in and out, in and out.  But it's kind of disgusting, and it takes, like, a half hour just shooting a close-up of a vagina.  And as I'm shooting it, Gary Shandling comes to visit the set with a very serious Dalai Lama-like Buddhist monk that he's friends with, that I know.  And the guy, it's like the day to kind of see the set, and that's all this monk gets to see is this head coming out of the vagina, in and out, in and out. 
[02:30:30]  And I looked over at him, and I thought, this guy is the real deal.  He doesn't look sickened.  He doesn't look amused.  He doesn't look aroused.  It had zero effect on his face.  And I thought, that's Buddhism right there.  Well, it's a vagina.  He probably didn't recognize it.  What is that strange piece of food that it has coming out of?  It is true, though.  That's a Buddhist monk just sitting there.  Yeah.  A lot of people say it. 
[02:31:00]  Undeclared was their favorite TV show of all time.  There's a lot on instant feedback, especially Devin in New Hampshire.  It was one of the funniest shows on TV at the time.  Well, back then when we did Undeclared, we thought, okay, Freaks and Geeks, maybe it's a little dark because it's about kids having a hard time.  The freaks clearly were going nowhere.  The geeks were getting their asses kicked a lot.  And we thought the show was about how you handle adversity and how it turns you into a better person and the bonds between these kids as friends.  But clearly, like, the freaks are not going anywhere and there's something deeply sad under the surface. 
[02:31:30]  So with Undeclared, we thought, well, I guess a college show is, you know, the reward, you know, for having survived high school and it will show the fun side of things.  And so we thought it would be popular and we're surprised that it also got canceled.  But that was the first time I directed Adam Sandler was he did an episode of Undeclared.  And the premise was that he came to the school and had sex with one of the students. 
[02:32:00]  And the student, played by Carly Gallo, kept lying and saying, we just hang out in his hotel room and watch the Pelican Brief.  And she had this cover story for what actually happened, but she didn't know who was in Pelican Brief.  She kept switching whether or not it was Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington or something like that.  And what was he saying during the commercial about it?  You wrote a letter to the guy that canceled Undeclared or something?  Well, so Undeclared was on and they said, you know, we're going to give you the time to find your audience. 
[02:32:30]  And that's a big part of television is how long will they give you until you get successful?  And there's a lot of famous stories about shows that were on the brink, like Seinfeld.  And then after two and a half years, it breaks through and gets huge.  But they just hung in there with it.  So they said, OK, we're going to give you the year.  And then it became clear, oh, they're going to cancel us.  The writing was on the walls.  They took away episodes they had ordered.  We weren't canceled, but they told us to stop shooting and things like that.  So on the day that we get the bad news that they're reducing the order, 
[02:33:00]  Time Magazine says that they thought that Undeclared was one of the 10 best TV shows of the year.  So I quickly have it framed and I put a note on it.  And it was to the same executive who had canceled the Ben Stiller show.  And I wrote, how is it possible that you're fucking me in the ass when your dick is still in me from last time?  And then the studio is in a panic because they hear that I've messengered this.  And then now there's people running to head off the messenger before it gets to the executive's office. 
[02:33:30]  And actually an executive at DreamWorks had it in his office for the last decade and just sent it to me.  So he has the actual note of the frame.  Did the guy get it that you sent it to?  He didn't, but he got word of it.  Of course.  You know what?  Good for you.  You obviously probably saw this, King of Comedy.  Oh, King of Comedy is the best.  King of Comedy, I remember when it came out.  It came out right after the Reagan assassination. 
[02:34:00]  Attempt.  Yes.  In my head, that was different.  And people were really freaked out about the whole stalker thing.  That seemed to be in the air.  And I remember the movie through people.  Yeah.  I couldn't have loved it more.  And I still watch it.  I do, too.  It's one of those amazing, just talk about uncomfortable moments where you're watching just going, oh, no.  And it's hard.  It's difficult to watch where, you know, when he's at Jerry's house, it's like, Jerry, what's your pleasure? 
[02:34:30]  Like, he's going to make Jerry a drink.  In his own house.  You know, in his own house.  Jerry's just looking like...  And the house man keeps going, Mr. Lankford, you want me to call the police?  Yeah.  I call the police, Mr. Lankford.  I'm having a heart attack right now.  Or when he gives him my pride and joy.  It's pride and joy.  And that was like when he had just kind of helped him and he was walking up the steps.  It was fucking horrendous.  Yeah, yeah.  The only guy better at making you cringe was Gervais in the original Law of Us.  That's the only guy that could ever make me cringe comedically more than Rupert Pupkin did. 
[02:35:00]  I was like literally embarrassed for Rupert Pupkin when he handed him that card.  And when he's sitting there, I'll wait.  I'll wait in the receptionist's office.  And he's staring at the ceiling and he's waiting for them to listen to his tape of his stand-up,  what's supposed to be like The Tonight Show.  And I always remember the line because it made me laugh.  And she's staring at him and he's looking at the ceiling and he goes, is that caulk?  And she goes, I don't know.  Is it dripping on you?  Is it dripping on you? 
[02:35:30]  No, no.  I actually watched that movie because I think it's actually a beautiful looking movie.  The shots are kind of fantastic.  It's like a style of shooting.  I don't know what they're doing, but I always look at it and go, why does this look so good?  The basement scenes are just unbelievable.  Yeah, that is really good.  I can't do it.  Ma!  And they did it right after Raging Bull.  Scorsese and De Niro.  I think that was the thing they did, which is amazing.  They do this violent work of art.  And then this bizarre fucking kind of offbeat comedy.  It was an amazingly ballsy thing. 
[02:36:00]  Completely different movies, obviously.  And we were talking about technology.  The phone booth scenes, though, take you out of king of comedy.  I mean, there are no phone booths.  Phone boom.  But I was like that.  I was like a little bit of a stalker kid when I was young for comedians.  I wanted to meet comics so badly and ask them, how do you do it?  When I was about 16, that I started a radio show at my high school, which was an interview show with only comedians.  So I would call comics and ask for interviews and say, yeah, I'm with WKWZ Radio on Long Island. 
[02:36:30]  And they thought it was a real radio station.  And then I would show up at their house with this gigantic tape recorder and show up at Jerry Seinfeld's door with the biggest tape recorder you've ever seen.  And they'd have a look on their face like, oh, I can't believe I got into this.  What did I get myself into?  Yeah.  But they would sit with me and tell me how they got into comedy.  And I remember I was doing this interview.  I interviewed Sandra Bernhardt.  She was one of the first people that I interviewed.  And then I went and did an interview with this guy, Larry Amoros. 
[02:37:00]  Remember Larry Amoros?  He was in like the seventh annual Young Comedian special.  He was a funny fucking dude.  Larry was very funny.  And so I interviewed Larry Amoros and then I go to the bathroom at this restaurant and suddenly Larry Amoros is in the bathroom.  And he starts asking to see my dick.  Let me see your dick.  Let me see your dick.  Holy shit.  And I'm like, what?  He's like, let me see your dick.  And I'm just like, what are you talking about?  He's like, I got a bet with Sandra Bernhardt that I could see your dick.  I'd find a way to see your dick.  And I was like, I'm not cool with that. 
[02:37:30]  That's not cool.  Yeah, because you lose the bet.  Exactly.  What's the other part of the bet?  It felt like it was a multi-stage bet.  And so I said no, but I was like, oh, I've got to be more careful.  Yeah, right?  My first New Year's Eve performing, the first time I did a New Year's Eve gig was Rascal South 1992 with Larry Amoros as the headliner and Will Miller.  Do you remember Will Miller?  Yes.  Dr. Will from Nick at Night.  Absolutely.  Very funny stand-up.  And I was in the bathroom tinkling and fucking Larry Amoros came in and he didn't ask to see my hog, but he did try to do the old peek to the right. 
[02:38:00]  Really?  And look, I did open mics.  I'm driving home at two in the morning.  I know what goes on in the rest areas.  I knew exactly what he was doing.  And I didn't shy away, but I didn't show him either.  It was like Michael after he shot fucking Salazzo.  Yeah.  Don't look him in the eyes, but don't look away either.  But that was the funny thing.  When I lived with Sandler, he's from New Hampshire.  And when we first moved in together, he would always go like, let me see your cock.  Let me see your cock.  And I'd be like, what?  He's like, let me see the dick.  Let me see what you're packing.  And I'm like, get out of here.  Because when we were kids, we didn't joke like that. 
[02:38:30]  And so he's like, I just want to know what I'm dealing with.  I just want to know what I'm dealing with.  I just want to know what's happening in the apartment.  And I was like, get out of here.  And I think he was just amused at how uncomfortable I got.  But then one day I was taking a piss.  And I look in the mirror.  And he's just staring at my dick.  And Sandler just goes, all right, man.  All right.  Good job.  Good job.  And there were those guys that were just really comfortable.  You know, the guy who would just take his penis out at a restaurant and just wait to see if the waitress notices. 
[02:39:00]  Well, Jimmy had his ball bag out once for everybody.  When I first met these guys, like 2000, we probably knew what we were in for with Jimmy.  We were in an event.  We learned fast.  Talking to some girl at a bar.  And then this would be almost a borderline sexual assault now.  But I didn't realize I had my fucking dick out.  And she had jeans on.  And I'm leaning.  I'm talking to her.  And I'm just kind of pressing my bare dick on her jeans.  And I'm like, look, look, look.  And I can't believe I fucking did that.  I would never do that now.  Just hanging out tomorrow.  Yeah, it was all right back those days, you know. 
[02:39:30]  It was the salad days.  Yeah, when I was a kid, you could rub your dick on a stranger.  She'd laugh.  She'd point at it and understand the irony.  Kenny's on the phone in a panic.  That must mean the arrival of Dyson.  Oh, of course.  Just minutes away.  I'm excited about how this room is going to change when Dyson.  It turns into the Dyson show.  He'll walk in with a video camera.  He videotapes everything.  He's a fucking lunatic.  You talk about your memory.  He fucking videotapes every moment of his life.  And where does that go?  Nowhere.  Nowhere.  He's like John Lennon.  He's just videotaping and filming in the park. 
[02:40:00]  Is that what Lennon would do?  Well, yeah.  That movie, Imagine, has just all this video.  And they would just...  They got into having film cameras.  But they would do it.  And there's some great stuff.  You ever see that scene in Imagine where the guy is sleeping in John Lennon's bushes?  And he's just camping out at his house.  And they get all freaked out.  And then they invite him in for breakfast.  And they feed him some food.  And he's trying to explain to them, like, I'm just a guy.  I wrote some songs.  It's not a big deal.  There was a problem.  Maybe you should have been a little more hands-off with your fans. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  He should have fucking...  Yeah.  I mean, Chapman signed him.  Got him to sign him and waited for him.  You know, it's like...  Yeah.  You can't stop that, though.  You stop to sign autograph a guy, shoot you.  A fan come to my house.  You guys have more security than those people had back in the day.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but he had a fan show up at the house.  A fan come up.  Yeah.  Come up to my house.  Anthony really panicked.  Yeah.  No.  Come in.  I go, yeah, what are you doing?  Yeah, come on in.  Have a beer.  Yeah.  So, comes in the back.  Because I figured, you know, I might as well...  Because if I sent him away... 
[02:41:00]  Now a guy knows where I live, and I sent him away.  You just had to bore him to death.  So I know nothing about it.  Just bore him.  I'm like, go the other way with it.  Like, this guy sucks.  So he never wants to come around again.  I never want to come here again.  Yeah.  Now, I figured it'd be better to, you know, get him and see what his name is, see what  it's about, you know.  The driver's license number.  Yeah, exactly.  And, of course, I was armed at the time, which is always good to kind of...  I made sure I lifted my shirt off.  Show the peace.  There you go.  And when did you go to the gun? 
[02:41:30]  Like, when he knocked?  Yeah, right at the knock.  Because when it's late at night and I hear a knock on the door...  How late was it?  I do make sure it was about, I don't know, 10, something like that.  Wow, that's pretty hardcore.  And what was he like?  A little excited to be there.  A little very talkative.  But apparently a husband and father...  And what was his intention?  To hang out and just have a beer, I guess.  But he kept saying, like, I know where you live. 
[02:42:00]  Like, I knew where you lived, so I knew where you lived.  And I'm like, this is a little freaky.  You know, he knew where I lived.  And then he's talking about things like he knew me or knows me, like where I grew up.  He goes, yeah, we pretty much grew up together.  I was like, oh, where'd you go?  I said John Glenn High School.  He goes, oh, I went to Half Hollow Hills.  I go, I knew nobody from Half Hollow Hills.  And then he's talking about, like, ex-girlfriends going, yeah, she was a real cunt, huh?  And I'm like, maybe, you know, you're getting a little... 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I think the key to this whole story is, how far was his drive to your house?  Yeah, um...  Did he travel several states?  He wore diapers like some female astronaut in California.  I believe it was on Long Island.  I do think.  It was somewhere on Long Island.  But, um, yeah, and people ask me, you know, well, why do you walk around your house armed?  That's why.  Exactly.  That is exactly...  That's the best part of going to Anthony's house, though, is that he opens the door, 
[02:43:00]  he's alone, he's holding alcohol, and he has a firearm strapped to his little slender body.  It's so fucking surreal and creepy.  And I'm alone.  I just would definitely be one of those guys who shoots himself in the ball.  Yeah.  Of course.  There's no chance I wouldn't make that mistake.  Safety's a must.  Dice is going to be here.  Should we get some nice entrance music for Dice?  What should we have?  Something just over the top?  Over the top.  Is he in the elevator?  Yeah, Steve just went down again.  Like what?  Like 2001 A Space Odyssey?  Something like that?  That is the go-to one. 
[02:43:30]  That is the go-to.  What do you think?  Yeah, why not?  As soon as we see his face down the line.  I'm going to move to the couch.  I feel like I'm going to go into that position.  Then the show ends, though.  No, we'll move you over here.  Yeah, right there.  Yeah, because you'll feel out of it.  Okay.  Now, does Dice know you know you?  We've met in passing over the years a few times.  Or do you want to put Andrew where Danny is?  Because Andrew kind of takes it this way.  Judd's not out of it.  It's like he's talking all over.  We should attempt to put him on the couch, but that will not work whatsoever.  Oh, Dice is on the couch. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, put Andrew where Danny is.  Why do I got to sit there?  I'm over here now.  They just take over the room.  Oh, my God.  I think he wants to promote, what was it, Dice Fest?  I'm doing Dice-a-palooza.  Dice Fest.  Hey, Dice-a-fair.  He just comes up with...  We go pretty far back with Dice.  Yeah.  We've had some interesting times with Andrew Dice Clay.  He comes with his fucking glasses like he's the manager at the Tangiers. 
[02:44:30]  All right, why don't we start the entrance music?  Yeah.  There you go.  He's at the end of the long hallway making his way to the Opie and Anthony studio.  Those giant, ridiculous glasses.  I know.  He likes big glasses.  It is.  It's like everything big.  Look, I got a man purse.  I'm wearing a man purse.  Big shorts.  His Gold's gym shirt.  Right in for Andrew Dice Clay.  Hey.  Jimmy.  Andrew.  You fucking whacking. 
[02:45:00]  I need a bio for Andrew Dice Clay.  We got a bio.  What do you think?  Dicey.  I don't think I need a bio for my pal.  Bio for the greatest stuff.  How you doing, you bastard?  It's good cologne.  I know.  Dice smells very good.  I'm back in the cave.  You lost weight, Dice.  I'm back in the cave.  Judd Apatow, right there.  Judd, what's happening?  See ya.  Yeah, do me a favor.  I'll slide over.  You just go over there.  What are you, crazy?  You've been here for a few minutes, right? 
[02:45:30]  I've been here for five hours.  Are you nuts?  Do you know who Judd Apatow is?  It's a big piece of...  Probably one of your setups.  I know who he is.  That's Judd Apatow.  No, it's not.  Because I just saw the movie.  Funny people.  I just saw Knocked Out.  Knocked Out.  Knocked Out.  But Undisputed.  Which one?  Knocked Up.  Knocked Up, right?  This ain't him.  That's him.  I'm not in it, Dice.  I'm the writer.  I say in the background. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, I thought you were...  Seth Rogen?  The guy with the curly hair.  Seth Rogen?  Jonah Hill?  The director.  No, I love that movie.  It's hysterical.  Thank you, Dice.  Let me tell you something about comedy.  I hate comedy.  I was never into comedy my whole life.  I don't believe in it.  Right?  I believe if you're going to have a comedy,  it's got to be real.  And it's got to, besides being funny,  it's got to have the heart.  And that's what your movies have.  It's funny.  Shut up.  I'll give you a smack right in your mouth. 
[02:46:30]  I just figured I'd bring it up.  Do you understand who I'm talking to?  Norton, tell him.  Shut your mouth.  I tried to tell him before you came in.  But you already said it.  You're not talking to Jonathan Town.  No, no, because I thought it was a good...  I thought he said it was Rogan.  I thought it was one and the same.  Yeah, okay.  I thought, like, as...  As the performer, you do, like, things to yourself.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  The Lon Chaney type thing.  But no, I really loved that movie.  I really loved that movie.  But I did see a thing on you in the back of, uh... 
[02:47:00]  The cover where Depp is on.  Oh, the Vanity Fair.  Yeah, yeah.  See, he's a real family guy.  See, that's why he writes a movie like that.  I relate to him.  You know what I mean?  Really good.  He's a fan of...  Really right on the money.  Because...  Go ahead.  No, go, go, go.  Because let me tell you something.  I'll tell you this straight out.  You know, I own two kids.  Yes.  Okay?  And...  How old?  14 and 18.  And I remember going in for the birth thing,  like in the birth room, and...  No, no, but this is what I did. 
[02:47:30]  If I knew you, I would have told you  to put this in there.  No, and it would have been even better than it was.  I mean, it was an A-1 movie.  It was a great movie.  No, no, but I would have made it, like,  a little better...  Than great?  ...for him, because I would have known you then.  Yeah, okay.  And what I used to do,  because a lot of people don't know,  I was a Boy Scout.  I'm not even kidding.  I believe you.  Yeah, I was...  I could always tell that.  No, I was really a Boy Scout, a tenderfoot.  And a Boy Scout, if you know the old...  You know, what is it, Anthony? 
[02:48:00]  Drifty, brave, clean, reverend, all that stuff?  I wasn't in the...  No, I was a Boy Scout.  He was a Scoutmaster who was arrested first.  That's why you're you.  That's why you're you, and I'm me.  Because you were a Boy Scout?  He's prepared.  Obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, reverend.  Say it.  I don't...  Say it.  No, I don't agree with it.  Exactly.  That's why you weren't in the Scouts.  Yeah.  So when my wife was pregnant, I figured, you know, I'm not going to go there last minute 
[02:48:30]  not knowing what I'm doing in the hospital.  So what I used to do, all kidding aside, I used to, like, stop by, you know, and go,  like, in the birth rooms where they'd have birth, these people.  You know, and what I would do, I'd get, like, dressed up like it's a doctor, you know,  and I'd put on one of the uniforms with the mask, right?  Sure.  And I'd come in there, and I would, like, help out a little, you know what I mean?  Like, I walked in on this one guy, it was unbelievable, because I didn't know this went  on, and this chick's laying there, and she's doing what she's got to do with what she's 
[02:49:00]  got, right?  Yep.  Give him birth, that kind of thing.  And all of a sudden, I mean, the husband was, like, one of these real nine-to-five, low-key  guys, you know?  And I'm standing in the background at first, and all of a sudden, she starts cursing out  this guy, you know, because she had one of her little pings.  You know, you know how they have the pain, right?  It's called contractions, I think.  Yeah, contractions, reproductions, I know all about this, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Sorry.  And she starts with cursing at him, like, yo, motherfucker, you did this to me, right? 
[02:49:30]  Well, she was cursing at you.  No, no, she was cursing at him.  Who are you?  Why are you here?  Why are you smoking?  No, I was an extra doctor.  Yes, yes.  Right?  So I look at...  What hospital is this?  No, no, she's a sign, though, right?  So I said to the guy, excuse me, can I say, excuse me, miss?  I go, who the fuck are you opening your mouth to now, right?  I go, let me explain something.  When this all came down, was you not there?  You know what I mean?  Did you not know what you were doing while he was dumping in you, right? 
[02:50:00]  So now, I go, you're in front of people here.  You got a guy, it's bad enough.  You got a guy between his legs trying to rip this thing out of your asshole, right?  That's the wrong side, but...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And you want to open your fucking mouth to this guy, the nicest guy in the world, calling  him names.  It's not bad enough he's got to be in here.  You got to embarrass him.  I say, shut your fucking mouth before I stuff a rag in there.  You understand?  At this point, did she still think you were a doctor?  Well, I told her.  I'm like the encouragement doctor. 
[02:50:30]  I'm the one that gets him to move it a little quicker.  That's some good encouragement.  So by the time my wife gave birth, I knew exactly how to behave in the birth room.  Did your wife curse at you?  Yeah, but she cursed because I was trying to film everything going on in the room.  I was trying to make a little movie.  Did you want the shot?  Did you want the shot?  No, no.  I didn't want that shot.  Not like that.  I would get an over the shoulder.  And if she didn't give me what I need, all of a sudden, when I need... 
[02:51:00]  I need her, you know, to give like a little more yelling.  Yeah.  She's like laying back just to piss me off.  You know what I mean?  So I had the doctor like give her a little smack in the ass to make her jump a little.  You know, visual effects in camera.  Yeah.  But when I saw your movie, I'm going, this is perfect.  This is exact.  That's what's great about it.  And you made it really funny.  But you wanted to make it better, you said.  Well, I would have put it in the practice scene.  Where he goes to the hospital to check out. 
[02:51:30]  Where the guy, Rogan, maybe shows up and practices with people in...  What's it called?  Like a birth room, right?  Yeah.  Delivery room.  Delivery room.  My wife yelled so loud, and it's in the movie, that they did say, can you please be quiet?  You're scaring other people.  Wow.  Yeah, she was...  That's loud.  I understood what the phrase screaming bloody murder meant.  Because it was like being murdered.  Your wife's in the movie, right?  She's in this movie?  She is, yeah.  She plays the...  Yeah, she plays the other... 
[02:52:00]  The wife.  She plays Eric Bana's wife.  Like the girl that Adam cheated on that left him when they were young.  She was funny.  That whole scene where they come in.  Yeah.  Like she thinks he's cheating and he's there for like the hockey game, whatever it was.  You really saw the movie, right?  No, he's talking about Knocked Up.  No, Knocked Up.  Knocked Up.  Did you see Funny People, though?  Not yet.  No, it's sort of a poster.  It opens today.  It opens today.  Well, it looks funny.  Oh, so she was with Eric Bana.  She plays his...  Yeah, she's got her head on the shoulder in the poster.  That's right.  Wow.  Better in this movie than Chopper.  You don't want her date on that one. 
[02:52:30]  No, when you asked if she was in the movie, I got confused because I'm thinking...  No, she was also in Knocked Up.  No, I understand that, but she's in Funny People as well, right?  Yes, that's right.  Doesn't she have a scene with Adam Sandler?  Oh, wait, you're going to pull up Funny People.  I get it.  A sex scene with Sandler?  I'm sorry.  My wife does have a sex scene with Sandler.  It's a little...  It's more of a sex scene.  Yeah, but it's Sandler.  It's Sandler.  You know what I mean?  But is that uncomfortable to watch, your friend?  Even though it's a movie, is it still like...  I have to say it was like a fetish.  I got a total kick out of it.  Really?  If it was other people, if it was Dice, I'd be threatened.  No, but that's what I'm saying.  What you're smart about, because your wife's an actress, but you pick guys like Sandler 
[02:53:00]  and Rogan.  You know what I mean?  Banner doesn't have a sex scene.  There's no Banner sex scene in the movie.  I'm smart enough to avoid that.  I don't mind if people have sex with my wife on screen, as long as they apologize to me  beforehand.  Like, sorry, I got to do this.  But you're really into your wife.  I read that thing, and they were asking, what's your favorite thing?  And he's like, to watch my wife and kids eat.  You know, I mean, he's really...  You know, of course, Opie just got married. 
[02:53:30]  Very nice.  It's good.  I love the whole thing.  But I'm a nerd.  I can't believe that anyone...  You've shown the picture.  What picture?  The picture that you showed me.  That's...  All right.  On the camera.  Whatever.  Do you have...  No, no.  He's really...  That's why you write...  Because you really are into...  That's why you write things like that.  I mean, I'm such a nerd.  I can't believe that she's here with me.  I'm shocked.  So every day is like a first date for me.  I'm so uncomfortable.  I just think she's going to run away at some point.  What's the worst part about watching?  Because I'm so jealous.  Like...  Because you know they're not really having sex. 
[02:54:00]  But is there a moment when you're watching...  Because in the show Lost, right?  Kate, in real life, is dating the guy who plays Charlie.  And she's always fucking Sawyer or Jack.  And I'm like, doesn't that drive you nuts to see your woman, like, just kissing somebody  on film?  Is there a moment where you're like, ugh?  And it's not even a sexual moment.  I actually feel like it's a tension release that she's just so happy that I'm not there  for at least a few times a year that she likes me more after the fact.  I'd just be worried if my girlfriends are requesting actors, like, can you have Yafin Kodo's number?  Well, a lot of guys say that. 
[02:54:30]  They're like, you know, what if you could cheat once a year?  I'd be so much happier.  It wouldn't mean anything to me if I could just cheat once a year.  Like, why wouldn't you give that to a guy?  It was like Curb Your Enthusiasm had an episode about that.  So for me, this is my thing.  And it's Sandler.  I know he'll be gentle.  Yeah, he's a low-key guy.  That's right.  And he digs his wife, too.  You used to work with him at Pips back in the day?  No, I never worked with him.  Never back at the Comic Strap or any of those places? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, and how fucking stupid is he never to call me to be in one of his movies?  Like when he did the football movie, right?  No, when he did the football movie, he calls, like, Chris Rock.  I go, well, does Chris look like a football player?  He's a fucking stick figure.  I got nothing against the fucking guy, but that's not a guy you put on a football team.  You look more like a prison football player, though, right?  Yeah, or I could have been one of the guards.  And I'm friends with fucking Sandler.  He should know to do the right fucking thing.  Because I did a favor for that fucking prick, cock, sucker, right? 
[02:55:30]  He comes in the mall, and I love the guy.  But you love him.  He comes in the mall, and I'm with my kids, and we're going to the gym.  And I hear some asshole yelling, hey, die!  So I don't even fucking look, because I don't want to meet fans, okay?  That's not how I, I don't believe in them, okay?  You don't believe in fans.  Not that kind of fan.  Not the guy yelling out of his car.  So all of a sudden, Dylan says to me, you know, this is like a year ago.  So he's 13.  He goes, Dad, do you know who that is? 
[02:56:00]  I go, yeah, a guy that's going to get a punch in the fucking face if he yells my name again, right?  And he goes, no, it's Adam Sandler, right?  So I turn around, I wave, and he's like, come on over, you know?  And he's sitting there with his mother and his daughter.  He's just, not his wife and the baby.  You know, so I do a whole number with a nice guy he is.  You know, he's very good in the movies.  You know, so I was really good about it, you know?  Yeah.  You'd think the guy would call up after that, you know, just in front of his mother, 
[02:56:30]  and go, you know, here's 10 million, do a movie for you.  You know, I think you're in the rotation.  You just don't know when it's going to happen.  Yeah, it still might happen.  We're all young men.  We're all young men.  That's right.  No, but I'm saying I like Stan in the movies.  You know what I mean?  I mean, he should have called me for his funny people.  I'm a funny person.  He should have called Jim.  He didn't call me.  I couldn't do it.  I don't know what the movie's about.  I'm lying.  I don't know what the movie's about. 
[02:57:00]  You know, I get it.  You know, the funny people thing.  It's about Al-Qaeda, ironically.  No, but all kidding aside, your movies are right on the money, what you do, really.  Well, you know, all kidding aside, I got to throw in some vulgarity.  We're on, you know, the vulga.  We're on the thing, right?  Got a door stick.  The network that can do what you got to do.  Exactly.  But you know, Dice, I was telling these guys before, when I was a young man, the first job  I had in this business, I was the busboy and the dishwasher at Eastside Comedy Club. 
[02:57:30]  I used to see you back in, I don't know, 82?  Wow.  83?  Yeah.  You'd come in, you'd do a little Pacino impression.  Where Eddie and Larry Maldonado ran the place.  Back at the, where Rick Messina was over there?  Yeah, Rick Messina.  Yeah.  Can you do old school Dice, like the stuff he used to hear?  Well, I'm going to hear this Pacino.  You did some Travolta.  I've been doing that again when I do my shows, I do all that stuff.  What did you like?  I remember you doing Travolta.  Yeah, Travolta, Pacino.  You want me to do Pacino? 
[02:58:00]  Pacino.  Pacino.  No, no, no, I'm not going to do Travolta.  No one else does.  You don't do Travolta?  I do a little, but it's more of a character.  I do.  And let me tell you something.  This is like extra talent I have.  Yeah.  No, like I don't really, like when I'm in.  I was just at the Trop in Atlantic City, and I gave them the extra talent.  I didn't even care.  You know what I mean?  I did the stand-up, you know, and they're sitting waiting, you know, it's like, you  know, when can we get out of here?  That's all I'm thinking.  I'm waiting to say goodnight, you know?  Yeah.  I'm saying, you know what? 
[02:58:30]  You know what I'll do?  I'll give them extra talent.  You know what I mean?  And I won't even charge more.  They already paid.  You did your Richard Nixon impression.  You pulled them all out, the old stuff.  Wow, you knew all that.  You did Richard Nixon.  Dice.  Let me make that perfectly clear.  Wow.  Wow.  Perfect.  And that's what I'm doing if he is.  Perfect.  I just throw that out there.  Let's close our eyes.  Yeah, close your eyes.  I really want to enjoy the next day.  All right, give me a line you want from Nixon.  Give me the line. 
[02:59:00]  Checkers is my dog.  All right, our eyes are closed.  Checkers is my dog.  Holy shit.  Who's that?  Wow.  Yeah.  Remember Ed Sullivan, right?  All right.  Did you do Ed Sullivan?  Hey, close your eyes.  All right.  You know, he had Toto G. Joe, the little spigatier mouse, whatever.  Toto G. Joe, I think.  Yeah, Toto G. Joe, the Spanish mouse, right?  Toto.  Puerto Rico mouse, right?  Right, right.  All right, so this is Ed Sullivan.  Close your eyes, man.  What are you doing?  Okay.  All right.  Hey, look over here.  We got a great fucking show for you to see tonight. 
[02:59:30]  We got the Beatles and all this sort of fucking things going on.  Wait, I have to open my eyes.  And then Sammy Davis.  No, I have to open my eyes.  Ed Sullivan didn't curse.  No, no.  During rehearsal, he would.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm wrong.  I'm wrong.  All right.  Our show tonight includes Sammy Davis Jr., okay?  Uh-huh.  Why can't I find my eye?  Perfect.  No, see, that was an effect. 
[03:00:00]  It's an...  What kind of man is this to never fall in love?  You do the mouth and everything.  He's up.  He's up.  It seems like...  Now he's standing.  All right, he's standing.  Glasses are on.  Glasses are on.  I'm the only one that I've been dreaming of.  A kunk, a kunk, a kunk, kunk, a kunk, a kunk, kunk, a junk. 
[03:00:30]  Why can't I...  And that...  I'm just doing that for you.  This is 7 in the morning over here.  I'm not even trying.  I'm not even going to wait four minutes, right?  Hey, John Travolta.  You're not even trying.  John Travolta.  Let's go.  John Travolta.  Listen to this.  You're going to die.  I swear you're going to crack up, right?  What?  You remember me, right?  Tony Manero?  Of course.  I was looking at you.  You was looking at me.  Do the girl part. 
[03:01:00]  I don't know the girl part.  Tony, why did you do it to me?  Oh, I get it.  I get it.  I get the type.  I get the type.  See, he knows the line.  All right.  Do it with John.  All right.  A comedy team is happening right now.  Yeah, this could be fun.  Al Pacino.  Al Pacino.  Yeah, but I didn't prepare scenes.  All right.  You don't need to.  You and my brother.  You and my brother.  Yeah, do the fucking Godfather 2 scenes.  Oh, for you and my brother.  I'm sorry.  I'm frustrated.  Who's frustrated?  Everyone thinks I'm stupid.  Come on.  Godfather 2. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Godfather 2 dice.  Doing Fredo.  Doing Fredo for you.  That's a Jewish guy doing Fredo.  It's hard to tell.  Everyone thinks I'm stupid.  I'm smart.  Uh-oh.  You stumped us.  Yeah, yeah.  Fredo.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  From here on in, you don't know me.  You don't come to my house.  What's another line?  We're no longer brothers.  We're no longer brothers.  When the wives are around?  I'm dying over here.  Today, you see that man over there, he's going after a judge. 
[03:02:00]  And if he gets him, he's going to be a big star.  He'll be in this month's law review, centerfold.  What movie?  Injustice for Law.  Arthur Arthur.  Do Arthur Arthur.  Arthur Arthur.  Yes.  No, I don't read books.  I don't read...  No, it was a movie.  The kid who played Harlot.  Oh, and he changed his voice.  Like when he becomes like in Donnie Brodsko.  Yeah.  Donnie. 
[03:02:30]  Wise guy's always right, Donnie.  Even when he's wrong, he's right.  That's good.  All right.  That's the new Pacino.  From now on, you dress like me.  Do Devil's Advocate when he really was over the top.  I never saw that one.  I don't like movies like that.  Ant does that one good.  Look, but don't touch.  Touch, but don't taste.  No, that's not it.  That was good.  What do you mean that's not yelling?  No, he had the passion.  Yeah.  But the voice wasn't there, Anthony.  Now you know the line.  You do it, Dice.  Do it again. 
[03:03:00]  No, no.  I'm going to do it all day.  Was it a big ass?  He said, he's got a big ass.  Yeah.  No, I love Pacino, but I like when the voice changes.  I love like the Donnie Broscos.  Like that one?  Like everything he says is like gospel to Johnny Depp.  I like the other one where it was almost like his mouth was while you're trying.  You don't walk out on me.  I walk out on you.  I was going to try the way.  I like the one way.  My mother.  My mother could walk anywhere.  Why do you even try?  Who's talking now?  I'm doing it.  Not me.  You had me.  Come on. 
[03:03:30]  You did this to you.  Anthony was.  You did this to you.  Anthony was.  Anthony was just saying I'm at Westbury on when, Saturday?  Yeah, you did say that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we're good with that.  Saturday night.  So now we can continue.  But Anthony was trying to like share and kind of go back and forth with you.  I was trying to do the early Pacino, but I said he sounds like he's had his mouth wide  shut.  Absolutely.  No.  Look what I throw at you with like nothing.  Here's Sylvester Stallone if he does like a French movie, right? 
[03:04:00]  Absolument.  Well, I got to top you with the Tony Roberts in Annie Hall.  Oh.  Twins, Max.  Imagine the possibilities.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't do Tony Roberts, do you?  Why?  That's that guy that gets your jobs, right?  No, that's Tony Robbins.  Tony Roberts is an actor.  Oh, Tony Roberts, like from Serpico.  Was he in Serpico?  Yeah, he played the guy that kept bringing Pacino to all the outside agencies. 
[03:04:30]  He was good, that guy.  Can you at least acknowledge he did a great impression there, Dice?  Forget that.  He's a writer.  He's a great writer.  He knows what he's doing.  This is extra talent.  This is extra talent.  Extra talent.  All right.  So Pacino from Serpico, okay?  Here we go.  Okay.  By my appearance here today, I hope that police officers in the future don't go through  the same frustrations and anxieties I've gone through in these last five years in my 
[03:05:00]  attempts to report corruption.  And then he chokes a little.  You threw that in.  Do you know who I love?  I like how you threw that in.  You ever see True Romance?  Yes.  Okay.  That's Hopper's sentiments?  No.  Forget that.  Everybody brings up, like, because it's a big scene.  That's all bullshit stuff that leads up.  Remember the gangsters?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:05:30]  So there was that one guy with the gangsters.  He wore, like, sunglasses.  He had the pompadour.  And right as they're getting ready, like, in the hotel room for the big shootout?  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you remember when the guy goes, he's looking at them, right?  And he's combing his hair in the mirror.  And he just looks back and he goes, shut the fuck up, you crazy wop.  You remember that?  That guy, to me, I don't know his name.  That's what the movie built to.  That was it right there. 
[03:06:00]  Because the way he did it, it's not like he, you know, when you get any kind of line in  a movie, when it's not a big part, you know, a lot of day players, they'll just, like, do  the line.  Right, right, right.  You know, and the director comes.  No, that was fine.  This guy, it was like watching Marlon Brando get his first part.  Or, like, seeing Mickey Rourke in Heat.  You know what I mean?  Not Heat, you know, with the blonde that was just getting ass-fucked.  Nine and a half weeks?  No.  Turner.  Kathleen Turner.  What was she getting ass-fucked in? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, what the fuck?  From Body Heat.  Oh, Body Heat.  Body Heat.  That was Kathleen Turner?  Oh, I think it was Body Double.  Yeah, Body Heat, right?  With Hurt, William Hurt, whatever his name is.  William Hurt's a great actor.  Yeah, do you remember that movie?  Not really.  Let's hear the William Hurt impression.  Yeah.  Who even thinks of him?  No, I mean, this to me is like an extra.  You know, he's doing all right these days.  He's had a nice little comeback.  All right, go ahead.  No, but what I'm saying is, but Mickey, like, took that movie with these two little scenes  and became a star.  That's right.  And when that guy did the thing about you crazy fucking WAP, all I do is rewind the tape 
[03:07:00]  and watch it over and over.  And I'm going, look at the way he's even moving.  Yeah.  Like, he knew that was the moment in the film that everybody's going to remember.  Okay.  You remember that?  No.  Because how many times did you watch the film?  Once.  Well, I've watched it at least 300 times.  And that's why you remember it.  And I've watched that particular scene maybe 1,800 times.  What about Michael Madsen? 
[03:07:30]  You're a big fan.  Oh, Michael Madsen.  Oh, here.  I know you do a little.  Michael Madsen.  Because I know Judd's got to go.  We've got to say goodbye to Judd.  No, just, this is Michael Madsen.  Like, if you said, how you doing, Mike?  Say, how you doing, Mike?  How you doing, Mike?  All right, now the viewing audience on the radio can't see this.  Is that good?  Right.  You know, but I'll do it for him.  Okay, so say, how you doing?  How you doing, Mike?  Look around the studio.  Cigarette in his mouth. 
[03:08:00]  Contemplating.  Good.  It's 14 minutes.  So, I did the short version.  It's like 14 minutes.  Why is it 14 minutes, Doug?  That's exactly what Michael Madsen does.  That's what he does.  Every word has to take like an hour.  It's 90 different.  Pull the pants up.  Look at the sky for some reason.  To see like, maybe like the word is written in the sky.  We loved having him on the show.  Oh, I love Madsen.  Listen, I got to interrupt.  For real, you got to leave.  Your people are saying, Judd, you got to get the hell out of here. 
[03:08:30]  I got to go do Charlie Rose.  Charlie Rose.  He's doing a big Charlie Rose thing.  He's all over the place.  Charlie Rose.  No, but really, I'm into your stuff, really.  If you want to, I got a movie for you I want to pitch to you.  Dice, I just realized I should have had you in Funny People.  Oh.  Yeah.  Because you just hired the people that you crossed paths with.  So, we went to Norm Macdonalds.  What am I going to do?  Yeah.  But clearly, that was it again.  And there are also other less known comics.  I'm going to call Stanley and go, why didn't you tell Apatow, put me in Funny People?  He's not part of those decisions.  I don't let him have any say. 
[03:09:00]  You should have had a little Jimmy Norton.  No, really.  You really came into the business.  But let me say this.  You know, it's amazing.  When I give a guy a compliment, you don't know when to shut your fucking mouth.  Anthony, please.  Oh, it's him.  I was drinking.  Let me get my compliments, please.  We're going to suck each other off just for a second before we end.  Let's listen to the Judd Apatow compliment before he leaves.  There is.  You know, I got two boys and I put everything through them.  Like, what do you think of this idea?  And I actually said, this is so weird because this is last week, that I wanted to get in  touch with you to pitch a certain film to you. 
[03:09:30]  So, if there's any way I could get in touch with you without going through a hundred people.  Yes.  You know.  Can I make it like only four people?  Who are they?  No, I'm just joking.  I do jokes too, Dice.  I know you do.  And you're funny.  Let me just say this.  Or else you couldn't write what you write.  Let me just show some respect to Dice for a second.  Okay, do it in there too.  Okay.  Here's my moment of Diceness.  You know, when I was a young man, I was 15 at Eastside Comedy Club watching Dice before  the Dice thing hit. 
[03:10:00]  And let me tell you something, being in that club, you knew it was going to fucking happen.  And that whole time I remember seeing you at Saturday Night Live when Adam was in the  cast and I was around the comedy store a bit, not getting any work.  Back when I was seeing you and Kinnison on stage a lot back in the...  Uh-huh, like back-to-back.  And those were great fucking days.  Those were like...  I mean, that was a lot of the height of comedy, though.  Yeah, that was like the last few years of it.  But anyway, I want to shake your hand.  Thank you.  And I'll see you guys later.  John, thank you. 
[03:10:30]  This was a pleasure.  Funny People opens in theaters today.  Would you take a picture with me before you go?  Yeah, of course.  It's so funny he said no.  I want a picture.  All right, we got to take a break then.  Judd Apatow just gave us two great hours of radio and we appreciate it.  Go see Funny People this weekend.  All right, we'll continue with Dice.  Ugh.  I got...  All right, busy show.  Opiate Anthony.  Jim Norton's back from filming a movie, but then again, he leaves, what, next week? 
[03:11:00]  I'm gone Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  But that's not important.  You should be plugging your big comedy night tonight.  Tonight, tomorrow night, I'm in Middletown, New York at the Manhattan Comedy Club, Rich Franchese's Club.  8 and 1030, 845-346-4242.  That's ha-ha.  And it's tonight and tomorrow only.  How far away is that?  About 40 minutes from the city.  All right.  So people who are in upstate and who complain a lot...  Can I go?  Yeah, I actually would like you to come.  So you want to take a ride?  What, tonight?  In my car?  Yeah.  I'll drive you around.  Yeah, I got some new stuff.  What do you mean no? 
[03:11:30]  My energy's fun.  Did you just say no to me?  What's that no to you?  It's just no to the whole situation.  Yeah.  Maybe.  You know what?  Maybe.  That's a goof.  Me and you.  You don't tailgate, right?  No, me and you with the GPS.  You don't tailgate.  I don't like tailgating.  A little bit.  I'm a taxi driver.  A little bit.  I hate to tailgate.  Anthony pushes him right off the road, but I tailgate.  No, no, no.  I just come up on him fast.  Yeah, it is actually.  What's the movie you did?  I'm doing it.  It's with Brendan Fraser and Brooke Shields.  It's called Furry Vengeance. 
[03:12:00]  It's like a PG-13 where it's about a guy who's trying to develop an area real estate-wise  and the animals are fighting back.  It's a family movie.  Oh, like the Area 51 movie.  I didn't see that.  Jesus Christ.  No, in Vegas where they keep the aliens and everything.  Well, I know what Area 51 is, but I don't know which movie it is.  No, that's what this is about.  It sounds like that's what this is about.  No, it sounds nothing.  He's the one that said it.  Why do I always get in trouble for developing land?  It doesn't sound anything like that.  It sounds nothing like that.  No, with the monkeys like Planet of the Apes. 
[03:12:30]  No, no, no.  Let's get you off track because I don't want to be off track.  Ever since you left, Anthony's become a big fan of your kids' band.  So we need an update on the kids' band thing.  Well, let me tell you.  I've got to give you guys a compliment.  I hope he's been the one that pushed it to the point where it's like he kept playing it.  I pushed it to the point, and now Anson, too.  He can't get enough of it.  It's on his iPod and everything.  Well, we're going back in to record as soon as I get back to LA to record more songs that  you're going to really love.  But what happened is, from airing on this, you know... 
[03:13:00]  We get all the credit?  Yeah, you do get all the credit.  Do we get some points?  Do we make money off this?  Not a dime.  Not a fucking penny.  No.  The point is...  And I say that nice.  That's not nice.  Well, maybe we'll buy you something.  We basically discovered your kid's band.  We should get something for that.  When the CD comes out, I'll have them sign something.  Give us big sunglasses like you're wearing.  That's right.  Can you at least do that for us?  Yes, I can.  You can give us the big sunglasses on.  Yeah, as long as you're nearsighted. 
[03:13:30]  Why?  They're prescriptions?  Yeah, they're prescriptions.  They're all prescriptions.  So wait a minute.  No.  Number one, they got a bunch of, like, the friend people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I was just looking for Mila Jovovich.  Yeah.  On the MySpace?  Yeah.  Oh, is he a rabbi?  No, Mila Jovovich is a girl.  Don't cut me off now.  Oh, God forbid.  You're here all day.  Perish the thought.  You're here all day.  That is true.  Yeah.  All day you do.  That is true.  You guys have to guess all the time.  Yes. 
[03:14:00]  I'm going to sit back and not cut you off anymore.  I'm sorry.  That's rude.  That's like, I see you do it tonight.  A lot of times.  And people notice.  Someone wants you out there.  Cool.  Steve Lee's looking uncomfortable on that fucking horrendous shirt.  No, let me, so anyway, they got a lot of.  What happened?  Do you want me to tell you that?  See, Anthony ruined our conversation just now.  Yeah, we were having a nice conversation.  Because it wasn't, once again, it wasn't all about him.  No, look.  Here's what's going on.  I'm looking and keeping track of guests. 
[03:14:30]  And you were a guest who was in here.  So you talk with Opie about the band.  And I will keep an eye out for the guests.  I will not interrupt you.  We have Steve Zahn and we're waiting for Mila Jovovich.  Right.  But, Ann, you're a fan of the band, so don't you want the band update?  Well, I have a job to do.  Band update.  I'd like to, you know.  I'm trying to give a band update.  But Anthony and his crazy-ass ego, you know, if you're not talking about him and what's  going on in his life, in the meantime, I got you through this whole divorce. 
[03:15:00]  I got you out there dating again.  Who'd you come to when you had all these problems?  Me.  Who spoke to you about what you got to do?  He's right about that, Ann.  He certainly is.  Who's the one that walked down the streets and we held each other, even?  You gave me advice.  We did a little holding.  Before your divorce.  No, no.  My divorce is still going on.  See?  You see what I mean?  I was more concerned with your happiness, what was going to happen for you, that you  would get on the right track, just like I did for fucking Tom Green when he broke  up with the little chubby girl. 
[03:15:30]  Drew Barrymore?  Yeah, just because she's in movies.  He's, you know, and he's sitting around the house.  I'm going, Tommy, you're Tommy fucking G.  You're Vincent's guy, right?  Let's get out there.  Let's get some broads.  Let's go to fucking Cancun.  Right.  Lay on the beach with some real fucking meaty boxes swinging over our fucking noses and  dipping it in our fucking tongues when we want and drink pina coladas.  I did that for him.  Not you.  No, I understand.  I would have been the same thing if you didn't become a hermit. 
[03:16:00]  Well, I had to.  Kind of.  Yeah, he's got to be a hermit.  You know what I mean?  I got him out there.  You know what I mean?  That's his lifestyle.  Any ass your balls are banging against is basically because I put them there.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  I never really thought that.  When you feel the ring of that fat fucking pussy just grabbing onto your fucking stem  and sucking the fucking goo out of it, think of me.  Think of me going, this is Dice's work.  It might be trouble getting the goo out if I think of you while it's happening. 
[03:16:30]  No, you don't have to think of me.  What I'm saying is I psychologetically put it there.  Well, you said the word wrong.  So anyway, the band number one, you know, the show really brought them a lot of fans.  Where's our thank you?  I'm trying to.  If fuckface didn't shut his mouth.  Who?  And again?  It's supposed to be on the second dot, the headphones.  What happened?  Because somebody turned it down.  E-Rock did.  Oh, all right.  Okay, so anyway.  That's loud. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, now it's loud.  So anyway, thank you.  That's better.  Yeah, I am thanking you.  You did give them a tremendous start that day, and I tell everybody about it.  And what wound up happening this past week, you've heard of the whiskey.  It's a really famous club in L.A.  You don't turn the headphones.  Ant, he's giving the band update.  I'm going to stuff a fucking rag in your mouth.  He turned it down to the first dot.  You've got to stay on the second dot.  If you want to turn Opie's headphones down, turn it down at Opie's headphone jack. 
[03:17:30]  He's giving a jerk-off face.  Look at me.  It's a band update.  Asshole head.  Go do what he said or I'll kill you.  I mean, I'll actually kill you.  I'm sorry.  I'll choke the fucking life out of you.  Get out of the room now.  Steve.  It's a band update.  Nice guy.  Band update.  Nice guy.  Nice guy.  Nice guy.  You like him?  No, because he does what he's told.  You've got to like a guy like that.  Yeah, yeah.  How about that?  How about that thing?  He takes it with a grain of salt when you say you can actually choke him to death.  You know what I mean?  Let's do the band update.  So the band update is great because what has happened is now they have actual record companies 
[03:18:00]  interested in them.  They do the whiskey last week.  This fucking guy here.  Ah, Dice.  He's...  What are you doing, Iraq?  He's interrupting the band update.  Iraq, what are you doing?  I'm not interrupting.  Yes, you are.  You're writing notes and Dice is...  Andrew's in the middle of the stands on there.  They still got their songs?  Andrew's doing a...  Iraq!  Andrew's trying to say something to Opie and you come in...  I while we wait.  Doing hits one. 
[03:18:30]  Whatever.  Who cares what he's doing?  You know what?  Tell him who gives a fuck if he leaves.  That's right.  He's right there.  Do you think that's going to be the ruination of the show or that he's going to be...  He's listening to you.  He's right outside the studio.  We like him.  I have no problem with him.  All right, band update.  Go ahead.  Band update.  All right, so anyway, they did the whiskey last week just as like, you know, where people  like...  Stevie T.A.  You know, where they...  All right.  I'm not doing it because...  When?  Hopefully soon, but we want to know if we should reroute them until she gets here.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry, Dice. 
[03:19:00]  If that works for them, yeah.  If that works for them.  They will come in the fucking toilet and hold the door closed.  Tell them don't leave.  No.  They're not leaving, are they?  No, they're just going to go do another radio show.  Steve.  Dice is in the middle of the band update.  Put them on a band update.  We need to get a guest update.  I know.  But his kids play the whiskey.  That's huge.  Oh, that is.  I think the doors play there.  Tell them not to leave.  The whiskey's a legendary place out there.  Yeah, so they did a little show there on last, I think it was Wednesday, and of course,  the people that run the club, you know, to them it's just another night at work, the 
[03:19:30]  management, the sound guys.  Sure, sure.  So now they go on that night, and by the end of the show, everybody working in that club  is like, who the fuck are these kids?  So they come over, they were having, they were having, they were having, if you don't  want me to tell this, I won't tell it.  What?  What do you think?  That's funny?  Yeah.  No, no, not when you interrupt like that and you keep doing it.  I'm sorry, Dice.  I'm sorry.  I'll be, I'll let you talk.  No, see, this is where my temper goes. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, shit.  No, serious.  All right.  See?  He's going to, he's going to hold a grudge for eight years.  Be careful.  Be careful.  Is that going to be forever?  Eight years from now, you'll know why he's married.  Eight years from now, you'll know about this.  Holy shit.  No, because he retributed himself.  How did I retribute myself?  By, by doing what you did.  I mean, they even saw, like I was able to go home.  Oh, I see.  And so you say, this is.  I made good.  Yeah.  I mean, they were, they were.  A decade later, I made good.  They were out in their mind.  And now we're all back together, right? 
[03:20:30]  That's right.  I've always been fans of your kids.  Kelly Clarkson.  What happened from.  All right.  I'm not talking.  Where is she?  I'm just going to get interrupted.  I kind of want to see her.  Can I get a picture with her?  Where is she?  This motherfucker.  If I get up.  If I get up.  Really.  I have.  I'm sorry.  Kenny knows.  I really have a bad fucking temper.  I just got handed a note that Kelly Clarkson's down the hall.  And I don't know if it's going to be forever.  Let's get a picture with her.  So I figured I want to get a picture.  You're still going to take a picture with her whole.  I don't want to take a picture with her whole.  With her whole.  You've seen the rest of her. 
[03:21:00]  Did you see her whole?  Can we bring her in here?  No.  Can we bring her in?  I'm sorry.  Well, we're getting Liam.  All right.  She's pretty fat.  Let's bring her in.  Let's bring her in.  Okay.  What?  What happened, Sam?  Hey, see, that's a problem.  Yeah.  What?  I'm a problem now?  She's the first winner on American Idol.  I don't need a picture with her.  So go get it.  Okay.  He's being a problem.  Let's get the band update.  I heard Whiskey and Go-Go.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, but what happened from just a little show there, they were having a crew fest there  this past Saturday.  Okay?  So what happened is.  What's a crew fest? 
[03:21:30]  A crew fest was like, it's a benefit, but it's like a tribute to, you know, with their  music.  They kind of made.  And of course, the kids don't play.  They play their own music.  Right.  You know, and they gave them like the prime spot.  They go, would you guys want to go on right in the middle of the show for a 45 minute  set?  And two record companies already approached them from that set.  Songs like that you didn't hear, like Rebel and Beach Bum that we're going to record now.  And they're just.  What's that not done by 730 or 1030? 
[03:22:00]  Uh, ha ha, ha ha, another interruption.  How do you think you look hanging from the ceiling?  You look like fucking charity.  Now tie that fucking thing around your nuts and hang you.  I'm sorry, but I just want to know.  I am Kane.  No, you're not.  Look at you now.  I am Kane.  Asshole.  What do you just do?  Tie his balls to a car or something?  Who does that shit?  He, he's very sensitive when it comes to his kids. 
[03:22:30]  You haven't learned anything over the years.  You don't have a fucking thing.  He held an eight year grudge against me.  You know what's going to happen?  I won't be able to give you the credit.  Right.  Because by next summer.  When they're number one singles.  You just don't give credit to Anthony.  No, see, what happens is he's connected to you.  Unless you get rid of him somehow.  Yeah, that'll happen.  By next summer, you know, when you can have L.A. Rocks.  How about we have separate credit?  And then Steve Zahn's in the other thing. 
[03:23:00]  All right.  I can do that.  Give me separate credit.  Because he's still talking about Steve Zahn.  Is Mila here?  All right, that's it.  I have to hit him.  No, no, no.  This way there's no fight eight years from now.  I get the anger out.  You understand?  That's a good point.  I'm just wondering.  I feel my pressure going up.  It's early in the morning.  If I saw Steve Zahn, I just want to know if Mila...  Is that...  Who the fuck cares about Zahn?  And when he walks in here, I'm going to knock the teeth out of his fucking head.  With a fucking asshole name from another planet.  Who the fuck is this guy? 
[03:23:30]  A mechanic?  No.  Why are you interrupting the big band update?  We've been waiting how many months?  He was in Reality Bites.  We've been waiting three months for the band update.  We've been waiting three months for the band update.  I did my own reality show.  That thing you do say with Silverman.  That's right.  Yeah.  He's a day fucking player.  He lives on and maintains a form in Kentucky.  I don't know this guy.  I don't know anything about this Zahn.  Tell him.  He's an avid flyster.  Tell Zahn.  Tell Zahn.  I want to find out about that.  I want the band update. 
[03:24:00]  You want to write it down to me?  Yeah.  The band update is that the record labels are looking at them.  Which ones?  He went to another studio.  I don't want to say which ones because there's two of them.  Okay.  How long is he going to be there?  Only five to seven minutes.  Just bring him in.  We'll all do the thing together.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Bring in Steve.  Andrew here.  Steve wants to hear him.  From what I understand, he's the nicest guy in the world.  And he wants to hear the band update as well.  Nice guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He wants the band update.  You know, he could probably help.  Who knows?  Maybe we'll get off to a bad foot with this guy.  Maybe I'll recognize him. 
[03:24:30]  He's doing a different stage.  Oh, I know.  Not Zahn.  Zahn.  From Zooland.  Billy Zahn.  He's the fucking best.  I can't wait to meet him.  That's Billy Zahn.  No, no.  Even you forgot about the band update.  No, no.  Steve Zahn is coming.  Mila's here.  Where?  They're coming in together.  Holy shit.  Get her in here.  They're coming in together.  Last time she was on, she fell down.  She was laughing so hard, Dice.  She broke her right, Mila Jovich.  She's still doing Hits 1 over there.  What are they talking about over there?  You know what?  This is where you're stupid.  That's right.  Oh, shit.  Tell him.  What's the matter?  Tell him.  Because, well, people are on other stations promoting and doing and making. 
[03:25:00]  You're more concerned with what's going on in booth number three over there.  Because there's people out there.  Than what's going on in here.  No, because there's people out there.  You want them in here?  You want them in here?  No, no.  Where the fuck are they?  No, no, no.  Yeah, go get them, Dice.  Dice, Dice.  Dice, go get them.  No, Dice.  Come here.  No, yo.  That's not.  That's not Steve Zahn.  That's not him.  That's not Steve Zahn.  No, don't have to sit down.  That's not Steve Zahn.  That's not Steve Zahn.  That's not Steve Zahn.  That's Roland's brother.  If I was a big shot actor, what the fuck do you do? 
[03:25:30]  That's Roland's brother.  What's the name of the movie, right?  You're not working now.  Get out of the room now.  Get the fuck out of here.  That wasn't Steve Zahn.  That's Roger.  That's Roland's brother.  Big shot.  Let's fuck out and kick his asshole through his ass.  But that was.  Kick his asshole.  Here comes Steve Zahn right now down the hall.  Oh, that was the wrong guy?  Right there.  This guy.  That's Steve Zahn.  Right here.  Go get him.  Go get him.  What the fuck is this guy now?  Go get him.  Dice is.  That's Steve Zahn.  Right there.  With black hair.  This guy right here.  Pull him right in.  He's yanking Troy Kwan into the studio.  That's Steve Zahn.  With black hair.  Right there. 
[03:26:00]  With the hair.  Where's Stevie?  Right there.  Stevie Zahn.  Come on in here.  Where the fuck?  Now you can't come in.  Now you can't come in, all right?  Kenny, you barricade.  You motherfuck.  She's with Mila, though.  You see what I mean?  What's Mila?  Mila Jovovich.  She's an actress.  You ever see Mila Jovovich?  Very pretty.  She's beautiful.  She's lovely.  Go get her.  I can't.  She's doing something with Steve.  They come together.  You want to all walk down?  Hopefully.  Let's all walk into that other studio.  Nothing like that, right? 
[03:26:30]  Oh, double us.  You know what I mean?  Come with me.  Don't fucking tell me what to do.  Whenever you're in bed with a chick, come like it's the movies.  Come with me.  No, no, no.  You're going to come.  You're going to leave.  And then I'll finish the right one.  So in eight years, you're going to hold a grudge for an amp and not me, right?  That's right.  Let's separate this.  That's right.  No, because you really did do a number on the kids, and a lot of people really responded.  Well, I certainly tried for you, Dice.  Punch up the one from...  He's still...  All right.  Let me show you something.  Watch what I do. 
[03:27:00]  No, no.  I can take an eye out from...  That's a warning shot.  You understand what I do?  I understand.  I'm just telling her...  I'm loading again.  I'm loading.  I'm loading.  I won't say a word.  Go ahead.  Make me do it.  Not a word.  Not a word.  Just say when.  Not a word.  Just say when.  All right.  Next time he interrupts the band update, you can do that.  Okay?  Band update.  Finish the band update.  Dice.  All right.  He's all right.  He's all right.  You don't have to flick...  I'll do the cigarettes at him.  Ooh. 
[03:27:30]  So two record labels are looking at them.  They're doing good.  They obviously are...  You got any other songs that we can play?  You said there's two they have to record.  They will.  We're going to record.  Why?  How many...  Have you been playing the music?  Pretty much on a heavy rotation.  Danny, why don't you put that up?  No, you haven't.  No, you haven't.  All right.  We haven't.  They've played a few times though.  They did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you the one.  Junkyard really has had...  Yeah, that one.  There's a couple that has really had an effect.  Jesus Christ.  But ones that haven't been recorded yet.  Yeah, get a bigger picture of that.  I mean, a bigger... 
[03:28:00]  What's this?  What?  What am I looking at?  Mila Jovovich.  Yeah, see?  She's coming in, and I want to see a picture so I can remember.  Very, very hot.  There she is.  See?  See, here she is.  See?  Even Dice forgot about the band.  Look, look, look.  Watch.  See, look.  Nice, right?  Nice.  Uh-huh.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  Ain't better looking than my chick.  She got a gun.  Ain't better than this.  Unless you're going to top my chick game.  No, huh?  Did I meet this girl?  No. 
[03:28:30]  Weren't you at my house?  You don't have to kiss ass on your chick all the time.  You could say that the girl's pretty.  No, I literally do.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  But you don't have to.  You want to see a picture of it?  All right.  Yeah.  You got a picture?  With black lace.  Yeah.  You got a picture?  I like the red bow.  Let's see the picture.  A chunky little fat ass.  Yeah, I like the chunky little fat ass.  Would you like to see that?  Do you have that?  Yeah, I got that.  I'm not showing it to you now.  Now that you said dice, you don't got to kiss her ass. 
[03:29:00]  You don't know her ass to talk about it.  I'm just saying.  And I don't like when somebody's disrespectful.  I was never disrespectful.  I never would be.  Oh, be the truth.  Was he not a little disrespectful?  Just not.  A little bit.  A little bit.  No.  A little bit.  No.  All right, De Niro.  I was not.  Just a little bit.  Now go get your fucking shine box.  Why?  He's choking around here.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  A little bit.  All right.  Break up his party.  Come on.  You fucking keep him here.  You feel strong? 
[03:29:30]  You feel strong?  Come on.  I just did the pass you thing.  I know.  I threw extra talent.  Keep him here.  Extra talent.  Keep him here.  Steve Zahn's coming down the hall right now.  Is he?  Right now.  Does he get the broad with him?  Don't let him in without the girls.  Since they're a big team.  Steve Zahn, he looks like fucking...  That's Steve Leeds.  He looks like Dennis Hopper would look now from Apocalypse Now.  He was a real guy.  You mentioned the Westbury.  They changed the name of Westbury, right? 
[03:30:00]  Yes, they did.  It's called a couple of times.  Capital One Bank Theater.  No.  Northport got bought by Capital One.  Now they're Capital One.  I'd rather call it Westbury.  I'm more into Westbury.  All right, we got someone we want.  Everyone knew Westbury Music Fair.  I need to get tickets from andrewdiceclay.com or livenation.com.  It's easy to get tickets for Westbury.  That's for tomorrow.  Tomorrow night.  So you got a weekend in comedy because you got Jimmy at the Manhattan Comedy Club in Middletown,  New York.  Yep.  Dice tomorrow at the old Westbury Theater.  Let's just say the old Westbury Theater on Long Island.  Tomorrow night, one show only at 8 p.m.  Dice, we want you to meet this guy. 
[03:30:30]  How'd you get andrewdiceclay.com?  I know.  I don't know.  I didn't even know I had it.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  Steve Zahn.  How's it going, Dice?  This is what I'm waiting for for now.  Yeah, get on, Mike.  Yeah, Steve Zahn.  Get on, Mike.  That ain't him.  Yeah, you haven't seen him in Reality Bites?  You haven't seen that movie?  Sure now.  I'm doing fine.  Let me ask you, what took you so long?  What took me so long I was here?  I was waiting for Nicole and me.  Why don't you come sit down?  What are you doing?  And he called on me.  He called on me. 
[03:31:00]  Sit down.  Let me explain to you.  Let me ask you a question, Steve.  Okay.  And I need you to look at me while I question you.  You're in a witness stand, okay?  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, if I find out by the end of this little interview I give you that you're not who you  say you are, I'm going to hit you really hard because I'm not going to let them make a  jerk off out of me.  You know that, right?  Because I have a really bad temper. 
[03:31:30]  That is Steve Zahn.  Now, can I tell you why I know you're not him?  Ed, why would that be?  Because I know who he is.  So this is a real asshole move.  Ah, see, here he comes.  Look, now here they are.  No, no, no, no.  Bring him in.  Bring him in.  Bring him in.  Come on, Bob.  Get out, stupid.  Get out of here.  Bring him in.  Bring him in.  Bring him in.  Bring him in.  Bring him out of here.  The Steve Zahn impersonate.  There's Steve Zahn. 
[03:32:00]  Hi.  What's going on?  How are you?  Okay.  Hi, Mila.  Hi.  Good to see you again.  How's it going?  Yeah.  Come sit down over here.  You'll get to see.  She's scared.  Hey, you're not going to be scared, honey.  You both know Andrew Dice Clay, I'm sure.  No, but they just had a guy in here trying to impersonate.  You want to see what they tried to make you?  Yeah.  Yeah, they had an impersonator in.  Where was this thing?  Was it like a real impersonator or just a guy? 
[03:32:30]  No, it was pretty close.  What is the catchphrase?  Did he talk like this?  What is the catchphrase?  What is the Steve Zahn like?  I don't know.  He didn't do a catchphrase.  He just started talking.  No, he just talked.  I knew it wasn't you.  You're just being silly.  I don't have it.  No, you want it?  That wasn't silly.  That's not about their movie.  What are you doing?  You're not being polite.  How's it doing?  It's not out yet, but it's really rad.  A perfect getaway, it's called.  Yeah.  It's a good thriller.  Yeah.  I love thrillers.  It's got a twist.  Yeah.  It's got girl fights.  Nice.  Green characters. 
[03:33:00]  Do you wield weaponry?  No, not in this one.  Damn it!  Maybe a little bit.  All right.  I like when you wield weaponry.  We do.  And so you're both the stars of this film, obviously.  What's the name of it?  A Perfect Getaway.  I think it's in the previous.  We said that already, though.  But anyway.  Let's throw it on a computer.  Yeah, they're pushing it.  Yeah, they have it on computers, too.  It's on like YouTube or something that pops up.  No, no, no.  But what I'm saying is my kids go to...  Actually, computers are great sort of a springboard for advertising these days.  No, no.  I don't know. 
[03:33:30]  You know, it's kind of new.  This is not a put-down.  My boys, they go to computer and watch all the new previews of films coming out.  Yeah, are you kidding?  Listen, I have friends that just go on that channel that's all previews and like one after  the other.  Great, yeah.  It's awesome.  What's the movie about?  The movie's about a couple that takes a trip on their honeymoon and, you know, they end  up in this, on this really crazy hike.  In Hawaii.  And what they don't know in Hawaii is that there's killers. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, no, I saw the preview where you're going around on the rocks, on the mountains.  I'm not kidding.  I saw this.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I'm sure.  No, I'm not kidding.  A lot of people have.  They said, no, no, no, you think I was kidding when I saw the preview.  No, no one thought you were kidding.  Yeah, where it's, there's like a few couples, you meet this couple, you think it's real nice.  Yes, that's the one.  And all of a sudden, like the guy like says something about somebody to somebody else and  then the problem starts.  Yes.  That happens in the film.  People do say things to each other.  What a great scenario.  No, no, but he says something like, not nice. 
[03:34:30]  And then it.  Jesus.  John, you know what I'm talking about.  I do.  I believe that you saw it.  Yeah, like, no, no.  Look, first, I don't think you're lying.  No, there's a bunch of different couples that go up there.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  I don't really believe you, honestly.  No, I'm telling you.  No, I don't believe you.  Nobody's feeding me anything.  Someone said something.  It's a movie.  No, no, no.  In the movie.  There's a guy in the preview.  Someone was angry.  I didn't. 
[03:35:00]  But it's a really fun thriller and it's got really great characters.  And the thing that's so cool and what attracted us to the script was really, you really  don't know where anything's coming from.  And all these people could be the killers.  Oh, a lot of twists.  So I like that.  I was going to, I did it because it was going to be Hawaii.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  And then they changed it.  But then they moved it to Puerto Rico.  Oh, man.  Which is great.  We love Puerto Rico.  Not as good as Hawaii, though.  Oh, fuck.  Puerto Rico.  What a party, huh? 
[03:35:30]  Surfing is amazing in Puerto Rico.  What's wrong with Puerto Rico?  I like it.  It's all right.  But the website is not.  The website for Puerto Rico is, you know, you think you're kind of going to Florida.  I mean, it's fun, but it's not.  It's not Hawaii.  It's so hard.  You're completely isolating the whole Puerto Rican market for us right now.  I'm not running for mayor.  It's not a movie, right?  It was great.  I loved it.  Everyone was fantastic. 
[03:36:00]  The food was amazing.  I didn't get sick on lobster there.  Everything on everything, right?  Did you really get sick on lobster?  Yeah, I got food poisoning at that resort the first night.  I'm lobster.  Oh, that's right.  Wait, in Puerto Rico?  Yeah, no, I got food poisoning.  And then the chef came out, and he was, like, really freaked out.  Oh, these shithouses in Mexico, Puerto Rico.  They bring your own food.  Do you know what they gave me?  They bring their own food.  So I'm crapping and throwing up, and they brought me a plate of cheese and water. 
[03:36:30]  Cheese and chocolate.  And champagne.  Yeah, I'll bind you up.  As a, like, as a, hey, I'm sorry.  That's great.  How do you get food poisoning from a lobster in an island?  Like, this should be the freshest seafood anywhere.  I don't know.  It was the special, too, was the Caribbean lobster.  That means they had it for too long.  They never do specials.  No, they want to get rid of it.  Fuck.  Special as shit they want to get.  They want to dump it.  No.  It is.  Oh, yeah.  And the waiters will push it because they have so much of this crap, they want to get rid  of it.  It's special?  They tell them to push it.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, it's a special.  It's a flounder. 
[03:37:00]  I'm glad I realized that now at 33, that a special is what they want to do.  Oh, yeah.  That's the plot.  I thought specials were the fresh things.  Of the movie.  A perfect getaway.  It's the plot, isn't it?  This guy goes in and gets food poisoning.  Do you know what you're doing now?  What?  Do you actually realize what you're doing?  I'm doing a Dyson impression.  No, that's not what you are, but do you know what you're doing?  I saw the movie.  You watch it in a big room with seats.  You've got people, okay?  And they talk to each other.  And things happen.  The screen talks to you. 
[03:37:30]  Do you understand?  And you sit in a chair and watch it.  Do you understand this is extra talent?  Extra talent.  You're using your extra talent.  I'm sorry.  The ice.  No, that's what I'm talking about.  Thank you.  Could you let Dyson be nice, Dyson?  So how come when I do extra talent, how come when I do it, you don't acknowledge it?  But with you, I'm nice enough and courteous enough.  I thought your Michael Madsen was dead on.  Oh, you want to see his Michael Madsen?  It's amazing.  Again, I've got to do it.  We've got two big stars.  Two big movie stars.  Two big movie stars.  This is Michael Madsen. 
[03:38:00]  Steve's on.  I've got to take the headphones off.  A perfect airway in theaters next Friday, August 7th.  All right.  So, Zahn, this is what you say to me.  Okay.  You go, hey, Mike, how you doing?  Hey, Mike, how you doing?  Good.  See what I do?  See what I do? 
[03:38:30]  See what I do?  See what I do?  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you got extra talent.  I don't work on it.  That's just extra talent.  That's just extra talent.  Dangerous.  That's just a little pearl you just threw out there.  Yeah.  A little pearl for me.  I didn't know what was going to happen.  I didn't know what was going to happen.  When I do that for crowds, they're almost, like, baffled.  They're almost.  I'm almost.  I'd be funneled at this point.  Let me ask you, Stretch.  Stretch.  What do you call Stretch?  That's Mila Jovovich. 
[03:39:00]  No, but I'm saying.  I don't call it Stretch.  I'm a mother.  Okay.  He's very tall.  No, no, no, no.  I'm a father.  What do you think?  I don't know how to do it.  No.  I just don't.  Yeah, I mean, when you're a mother, to be called Stretch is kind of.  No, I just told Apatow what he did wrong.  That was a bit of the meaning there.  I just told Apatow what he did wrong when he did not up, like what he left out.  You know what I mean?  What he left out.  Yeah.  The movie was great. 
[03:39:30]  And if he would have put this scene in that I told him, like if he could let go and maybe  put it in now, like for the DVD, it'll even be better than that.  What's the scene?  Oh, boy.  Oh, dude.  What?  Are you?  Steve's on the mic.  Steve's already on.  Yes.  All right.  So let me ask.  He said knock knock and you said who's there.  When I call you Stretch.  God.  When I call you Stretch.  I'm like giving you a joke.  When I call you Stretch.  Don't call it Stretch. 
[03:40:00]  Just stop holding a stretch.  She's a beautiful woman.  Listen to me, my little plum.  What do you mean?  Don't talk to Steve like that.  What I'm saying is how tall are you?  Because you, you know.  I'm 5'8".  5'8".  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  You're at least 5'10".  No problem.  Don't you even know what you want?  I'm trying to help you.  Okay.  Be nice.  You know, Mr. Clay, you're amazing and stuff, but you know, if you get fresh with me.  Yes.  Be nice.  I do martial arts. 
[03:40:30]  You like that?  Yeah.  You ever see her kick ass?  So like.  You ever see her kick ass?  I would watch out.  I mean, I'm just saying.  I would just watch out just a little bit.  So you like the physical thing a lot?  A little wrestling around.  You know, when it comes to being violent towards men, definitely.  What?  You have an anger issue towards?  Sometimes.  You ever see Resident Evil?  Are you mad at me now?  Guys, listen for a second.  I have a little.  I have just a little anger sometimes.  He doesn't.  Me too.  You know, but like, who doesn't?  Me too.  Isn't it funny how we get a little of this?  Look at those blue eyes, how they sparkle like the Nile. 
[03:41:00]  Look at us.  Like the Nile.  Look at those.  They got a little twinkle.  They got a little twinkle.  I don't know if the Nile's blue is like dirty green.  Come on.  You just insulted our beautiful eyes.  I gave her a compliment.  The Nile's not blue.  She's got the high cheekbones going on.  Come on.  Who do you think you're kidding?  Steve is feeling a little left out.  I'm fine.  Are you kidding me?  Steve had you on an island for four months.  If he couldn't make a move in that time, what good is it, right? 
[03:41:30]  Well, between my husband and his wife and her children, it was a little bit of a problem.  It could be a problem.  Do you know how, like, when you're on...  I worked with Shannon Tweed.  I got her to pose with a carrot hanging out of her mouth.  Well, he did take a picture of me with a wall.  She was playing a rabbit.  How hard is that?  I don't know if that counts.  Guys, we're not talking about their movie.  No, I want to.  It's just something everybody around you.  That's why I'm asking how tall she is. 
[03:42:00]  Do you know when you watch, like, YouTube and you're watching the thing and the dialogue  is, like, five seconds delayed and you can't...  Yeah.  That's what it's like right now.  I'm not even...  I have no opinion about the movie.  Go to the movie.  Whatever.  The movie's great.  Let's get past the movie.  Because you want to do another movie.  You're not getting...  This isn't about getting past the movie.  It's just that you already did it.  But I have a movie question.  I'm just revealing how to do it.  My head is really...  I have a movie question.  Oh, you first film it?  How can they film it and have a preview already?  What? 
[03:42:30]  Anthony says you didn't do the movie yet.  No, I didn't say that.  I said, let's stick with the movie.  Okay.  I have a movie question.  Ah, Jimmy.  And go.  You two are a married couple.  You're on your honeymoon in Hawaii and you're hiking and there's somebody killing...  Is there a lot of people after you or is it only a couple of people after you?  No, it's another couple.  No, you don't know.  It's actually...  It sounds kind of stupid.  I mean, it's...  Well, it sounds so simple.  But it's kind of like an old school thriller where you...  It's so intricate. 
[03:43:00]  David Toohey wrote it.  It's actually really good.  It's like you don't know who's doing what.  And then the minute you think somebody's doing it, you're wrong.  It's...  Well, because we don't even know that there's killers there.  And then we meet sort of hikers on the route that say, oh my God, there's been people murdered.  No, but is that...  Are they the ones...  And they're a married couple.  No, what you're saying.  And so we look over and we're with a couple.  And then we see like another young couple there.  And so...  And we know they're on the island.  And we're in the middle of nowhere with nobody to help us. 
[03:43:30]  But don't they act nice at first?  I'm telling you.  Well, of course.  I mean, we go on the trek with them.  And then...  I mean, that's the whole point.  I'm not making fun.  I like the preview.  See, they're knocking what I'm saying down.  But I saw the preview and I dug it.  So tell me the...  I would go see...  I want you to tell the audience what the preview is about.  The preview basically, you know, shows, like you're saying, you're going on a honeymoon  to this joint, wherever it is, where it's going to be like adventurous and, you know,  a lot of trees, mountains.  And from what I remember, there was another couple. 
[03:44:00]  And it all starts out nice.  And then the music starts changing.  And then it's like...  You know?  And...  I don't know what...  I don't know what the guy says.  No, no.  It goes into that at the end.  That's what the movie is.  At the end, then it shows all the craziness.  If you like that...  You like it.  The craziness.  Yeah.  No, no.  Where it gets dangerous.  A.K.A.  There's a genius girls fight.  Oh, man.  I mean, me and Keely Sanchez have...  And you do the karate thing?  Well, no, no, no.  No karate.  But, you know, we're fighting for our lives, you know? 
[03:44:30]  It's like the Private Ryan fight.  No, but in real life, what do you study?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, like...  But with girls.  Any little tearing of clothes?  Oh, yeah.  Lots of clothes.  What are you wearing when you fight?  Are you wearing, like, jeans?  Are you wearing shorts?  I'm wearing, like, a cane shirt.  Let's not take it to that level.  It's a fair question.  What are you wearing when you fight?  It's the best of both worlds.  Her dress from the fifth element.  You see, you gotta understand a show like this, they go to base.  It's humor.  Oh, yeah.  You know? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, where's the problem today?  Are you in hot pink shorts while you fight, you know?  Yeah, I want to apologize for a whole show except for Dice, who is being the perfect gentleman.  Yeah, I'm trying to be respectful to it.  How are you trying to be respectful?  This guy you was married to, is he with you there?  That's better.  My husband?  Yeah.  He just took his headphones off and says, I just figured it out.  Did he come to Hawaii and figure it out the secret?  Puerto Rico.  Why don't you let...  You're insulting everybody around you.  Because I can hear you smiling, man. 
[03:45:30]  He's got the noisiest smile over here.  Oh, you're the real husband on top of it?  No.  Who won't?  They might have to explain that.  Are you kidding?  He's got two kids.  He's a beautiful wife.  Well, how many you got?  I got one.  Oh, so you have a different husband?  Yes.  Well, we're actors.  We're not really married in the movie.  No, I get it.  I've done those kind of things.  It's just been a movie, you know, we're married.  But we have a separate lives.  No, well, that's what I'm asking.  You're a real husband.  Like, this didn't really happen to us.  It's not like Steve and I went on our honeymoon and almost got murdered. 
[03:46:00]  Look, I know what shows on.  It's like a documentary.  It's a movie.  It's a movie, guys.  Stevie, believe me.  I know that they're late at night in the tent.  It's our home video, actually, and we called it a perfect getaway.  It was really crazy.  We almost got killed, and we figured way.  It's a wild honeymoon.  No, but I'm saying, you know, you've got a helicopter tour of a volcano.  No, what I'm saying is, did your, like, real husband come to visit, like, when you was there?  Of course.  I mean, we had a four-month-old baby at the time.  For how many days? 
[03:46:30]  Oh, he came a few times for, you know, a week or so.  And isn't that, like, a pain?  Like, that you've got to, like, entertain him when you're trying to do a movie?  Like, you've got to focus on the fake husband, right?  Okay, you know what?  If you want to get totally real, I mean, you know, it does get a little overwhelming sometimes.  Yeah, because it's like you feel you've got to pay attention.  You know, if you have a new baby, you've got a film to do, then you've got family coming.  My mom came, my husband.  I mean, it was definitely real.  Yeah, well, that's why I'm saying, you guys, this is, if you're going to start doing these movies. 
[03:47:00]  You and I, do you want to go get a coffee and talk about this?  No, I'm telling you, if you're going to talk about this.  You know, I can't believe another man just relates.  Honey, I'm a Megatron star.  I'm a Megatron star.  I'm a Megatron star.  I'm not like a regular, you know.  I got a Megatron thing going on.  Is that like a children's toy?  No, no, it's a certain type of stardom, you know.  And what I'm saying is, I know it is.  He's as big as you get.  I know, I know.  Yeah, in my field, you know. 
[03:47:30]  But so I know, like, when they come to the set, let's say you've got the fake girlfriend  or the fake wife from the movie, it's like, I've got to do these scenes.  I can't just stand here and drink coffee all day.  No matter how much I'd like to.  Why don't you just take the kids and get the fuck out of here so I could do what I got  to do with what I got.  Wow.  Not that extreme.  Not that extreme.  Guys, I hate to interrupt you, but the people are telling us that they have to go.  For real.  Like right now.  Who's done their people?  Yeah, the people. 
[03:48:00]  Because they're on tight schedule.  I've actually been signaling.  Behind your back.  Help me.  The universe will get me out of here.  What show are you going to now?  What show are you going to over here now?  I'll tell you if it's even worth leaving.  Bow hunting, U.S.  Cycling.  Cyclers of America.  Are you doing like any of the Dice?  They got to go.  What don't you understand?  Hold on.  We got to plug the movies.  Are you doing any talk shows?  A perfect getaway.  It's amazing how everybody talks.  Thank you. 
[03:48:30]  Thanks, guys.  It's starting next Friday, August 7th.  Go see it.  Did you do the premiere yet?  It sounds like it's got a lot of cool twists and turns.  I am giving the big applause.  Now I tell you, shut your mouth.  All right?  Now you shut your mouth.  I got to get tickets.  Listen, all of you shut your mouths, okay?  Oh, Ariel is talking.  Okay?  It comes out August 7th.  It's an amazing movie.  A perfect getaway.  It's me.  It's Steve Zahn.  Tim Oliphant.  Keeley Sanchez. 
[03:49:00]  Go see it.  It's amazing.  I want to go to the premiere is what I'm saying.  Is it in L.A.?  Mr. Clay.  Yeah.  We got to go.  We really do got to go.  You guys, something you don't understand is called.  They don't want to overstay their welcome.  She's going to fight her way out of this studio in a minute.  All right.  Should we take a break, Ant?  Yeah, let's take a break.  All right.  Let's do that.  Opie and Anthony, we'll finish up with Dice in a second here.  All right.  We're wrapping up.  We're still live.  Rana Fez is about to come in here, but we've got to get everyone's  plugs in. 
[03:49:30]  Dice, you did terrific for us today.  Thank you.  I think.  Thank you, Dice.  It was a good show.  I enjoyed it.  It was fun.  I think you did well for us.  I'm not really sure.  I'll wait for the feedback later today.  It was a lot of fun.  And I'll get back to you.  It's funny, the feedback.  But I think I got a good feeling that you did well for us today.  I think.  I got to keep the I think in there.  I mean, I don't know what doing well means.  We don't either at this point.  Apparently.  And wow.  Danny, you want to share with the audience what you were enjoying during  that whole mess of an interview? 
[03:50:00]  Well, I'm just saying sometimes, you know, guests come in feet of the  female variety.  They're wearing short clothing.  You know, there's a lot of stuff going on, you know, and sometimes  sometimes things stick to skin in such a way.  You got to peek at some panties, didn't you?  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe like four times.  What color were they?  It was dark.  It was like a dark, dark gray charcoal.  Steve Zahn's or Mila Jovovich?  She's so delicious.  Do you think Steve Zahn enjoyed his time with those?  Oh, my God.  He seemed like a nice guy. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  And then we had Judd Apatow and we had Dice.  It was a full show.  It was a full show.  You want Bobo to come in and give all the official plugs for everybody?  Oh, my God.  We'll never get out of here.  I thought you were going to say the thing about the bass player.  Run, Bobo.  Run.  I don't know.  L.A. Rocks?  Is the name of your kid's band?  It's myspace.com slash official L.A. Rocks.  Okay.  Official L.A. Rocks.  Yeah, because they're still looking for a bass player.  Yeah, because they're still looking for a bass player.  Not my mic, you shithead.  So it's just running in here. 
[03:51:00]  Why would you take Jimmy's fucking mic?  You're fine.  I didn't know where to go because he just told me to run in here.  He runs right up to Jimmy's mic.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Pull your pants down and do the plugs.  All right.  Okay.  You have to.  In front of Dice.  Don't pull your pants down.  Yeah, you got to pull your pants down.  You got it.  You got it.  You got it.  You're going to regret it.  No, Jimmy, he's got it, right?  It's Dice.  You got to do it for Dice.  You don't do it.  No, you got it, though, for Dice.  I don't want to stay with it.  But you have to. 
[03:51:30]  I'm sorry.  That's what we do for our guests that give us really good radio.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't sit here watching this briefly.  We're running out of time.  I'm only going to do this briefly.  Dice, do you want your plug-in' or what?  All right.  Check out.  Do you want your plug-in' or what?  If he's standing behind me naked, I'll punch him in the face.  He's not.  He's not.  All we got to do is.  Wait.  You know, pull your pants down.  Come on.  All right.  He's not naked behind you.  Now give the plug.  He's not naked.  Why am I looking at this guy's private plugs? 
[03:52:00]  Because he does the plugs that way.  It's his thing.  Do it.  Do it.  I don't want to watch him do it.  It was their idea.  Their idea.  All right.  Give Dice his plug out.  This thing came from parents.  A mother and father brought this up.  Don't bring up the father.  Don't.  What?  Don't bring up the father.  All right.  Well, his mother did something.  Yeah, did something.  All right.  Drank during pregnancy, apparently.  I don't want.  Just let him do the.  This is what I meant. 
[03:52:30]  What?  He's.  All right.  We got it.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton will be performing tonight and tomorrow at the Manhattan Comedy Club.  400 root root.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dice.  I got to be honest.  He does it way better with his pants down.  Do you want a good plug for your dick?  I let him do the plug, but I'm not going to stare at him.  Pull your pants down.  Watch how much better he does than when he has his penis out.  And by the way, if you talk dirty, he'll get hard instantly.  Oh, God.  Pull your pants down and do the plug for me. 
[03:53:00]  Just pull him down.  I wonder if looking at an ass turns it on.  He's in my thing.  It's no one's thing.  Pull down.  How did this even get invented?  There you go.  When was the first thing?  Now, Bobo, do the plug.  All right.  Listen to how much better he is.  All right.  Good.  Bobo, look at that while you do the plug.  And he's hard already.  I don't know what he's making.  No, no, no.  Are you hard?  Bobo, are you hard?  What's going on?  No, I don't.  You don't.  Bobo, take a look.  Bobo, take a look at Jimmy's ass.  Stop it.  This is my Heidi. 
[03:53:30]  It just helps the plug stuff.  Go ahead.  Look at it.  You get good plugs with this.  Take a look at it, Bobo.  Bobo, take a look at it.  Bobo, look at it.  Look how nice that is.  What a snug fit that would be.  You put your cock right in there and grab it and back up on it.  Jimmy's showing his heinies a little.  Yeah, exactly.  A little.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  Take a look.  Go ahead, Bobo.  What the heck?  In fairness to Bobo, his dick isn't budging.  I got to respect that.  Yeah, well, thank goodness.  Good boy. 
[03:54:00]  Good boy.  Good boy, Bobo.  Good boy.  Dice, what do you think?  Good boy.  I have no opinion of this.  I'm blocking it.  Really?  Yeah, it's just not my thing.  Do the plugs.  All right, Jim Noren will be performing tonight and tomorrow at the Manhattan Comedy Club,  400 to 11 East in the Walk Hill Plaza, Middletown, New York.  Showtimes, 8 p.m. and what the?

[03:56:00]  All right, just to end it.  Just to end it.  Why didn't you get involved with the ring-toss thing?  Pull up your pants, Bobo.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  There's donuts in his pants.  They're full of donuts.  His underwear and pants are full of donuts.  What's wrong, you dice?  I don't know.  You couldn't throw one?  I couldn't do it.  What happened?  What the fuck?  Because I'm not the one Bobo's coming after with a machine gun.  You used to be an insufferable prick, Dice. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, really.  You're a little too sensitive.  Now you're all sensitive.  I was never into that.  We don't like sensitive dice.  That's toilet humor.  You were never into toilet humor?  No.  What about the other chick sleeping on the wet spot?  Fuck her.  Let's get on the floor.  You know what?  That's not toilet.  That's toilet humor.  That's sexual.  Yeah, well, that was sexual.  That was sexual.  Donuts at all.  He was trying to put a donut around his gag.  Exactly.  That's not.  That's like.  They should have that at Coney Island, though.  A guy standing like that.  He should. 
[03:57:00]  A guy would make a lot of money, right?  That would be funny.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, shoot the freak and shoot his cock.  All right, leave.  All right, get out of here.  What else do you want from us, Bobo?  Jesus, we gave you your time, Bobo.  Yeah.  Go eat some Dunkin' Munchkins out of your underwear now.  All right, we got to go.  I kept hitting his belly, and the whole thing would go, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I know.  His belly's shook.  We got to get out of here.  This isn't even on the air later.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What?  They cut this part?  I'm going to have to. 
[03:57:30]  A little bit.  Well, not this part in particular, but something.  Why are we bothering, then?  Yeah, I agree.  Let's go.  Right, Dice?  Yeah.  We got to get out of here.  When are you going back to L.A.?  I like when Dice just goes, and then we end it.  Then how the fuck are we going to do more radio?  I came in to do this.  Yeah, but I thought we'd do more.  When are we going to do more?  End this.  It's like Monday, Tuesday.  I'm not going to be here.  I've got to go home.  You've got to go home.  Oh.  When are we seeing you again?  When I come back.  How long is that? 
[03:58:00]  Pretty soon.  For Dice Fest?  Dice Fest.  Yeah.  Dice Fest?  How do you know about Dice Fest?  Because I'm organizing the whole thing for you.  Do you really know about it?  I did a piece of the action, though, this time.  Do you really know about Dice Fest?  No comment.  How do you know?  How do you know?  Because nobody knows.  Wait a minute.  How do you know?  What do you mean?  I'm the one that came up with it.  How do you know you did?  I don't know.  Then how do I know?  That's what I'm saying. 
[03:58:30]  How do you know?  I just know.  I know things.  Because you've got to know this record company, then.  I know things.  Who told you about Dice Fest?  I can't tell you.  I got my people.  That's messed up.  Dice Fest.  That messes me up.  Like, how can he know that?  It's like Dice-a-palooza.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did you know?  I can't tell you.  He's going to pull off a bunch of festivals.  Ant knows, too.  Dice stock, I heard about.  Ant knows Dice Fest.  That's what he said.  Yeah.  Ant knows, too.  Dice Fest. 
[03:59:00]  But how do you know?  Opie told me.  Yeah.  And then he found out from I don't know how.  You told me, Dice.  What's the...  I did?  Yeah.  I don't know how to keep my mouth shut.  Yeah.  Dice Chilla.  How come you don't answer your text?  Oh, you texted me?  Yeah.  A while ago.  Oh, I don't know how to do text messaging.  Yes, you don't.  No, I don't.  You Twitter.  Yeah.  Do you Twitter?  No.  You should.  No, you pussy.  That's as far as I take it. 
[03:59:30]  People would like that, though.  I don't want to Twitter.  I just can't.  People are saying Twitter is like the taint.  It's in between the shitter and the twat.  Twitter.  No, I really don't Twitter.  You don't like that area of a woman?  I just can't.  Stick it in a Twitter.  When we...  The other night, I'm licking this chick's Twitter.  Toilet humor.  Toilet humor.  No, it's not.  It's sexual.  Toilet humor.  No, you're licking something where...  Duty comes out. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  No, you're not.  Yeah.  There's no Twitter on the body.  You lick ass, right?  Yeah, why not?  What are you going to do?  Just ask.  I'm not going to do anything.  It's almost like rude not to.  You know, what do you make?  Like, it's not there?  I feel the same way.  You've seen how close it is to the box?  It's right there.  It's right there.  Yeah.  It deserves a little attention.  A little?  A lot.  It should become a second home.  I can look at it as a second garage for your tongue.  See, this is how you do radio. 
[04:00:30]  See how you're doing it?  Everybody talks one at a time.  Well, conversation.  We kind of want to get two hours ago.  I had no problem with it.  But you had a problem with Ant and everybody else.  No, because Anthony doesn't know when to shut his mouth.  All right.  I'll shut up now.  And I don't mean that in disrespect.  He's going to hold across for eight years.  You know that.  No, no.  This wasn't one of those.  And you'll be really confused.  I only get like that when it comes to my boys.  That's it.  That's what I mean.  So eight years of hell for Anthony now.  That's what he was talking about.  There is no time left.  For what? 
[04:01:00]  Because Ron and Fez are coming in.  We've got to clean the place up.  Do you want to say hi to Ron and Fez?  No.  We've got to go.  Ron and Fez.  I'm leaving.  I don't know them.  They're really good.  I don't talk to people I don't know.  I'm leaving.  Are you leaving?  I don't blame you.  Look at him with his little headphones.  Look, all computerized.  Well, I guess that's what it is.  When do we tell the world about Dice Fest?  We can't talk about it right now.  Shh.  What?  Don't talk about it.  Shh.  Why don't we just not let those guys in here?  You want to make a move, you lock the door, and you just stay on. 
[04:01:30]  But we did everything, and look, Ant's leaving.  That's his problem.  This is what I'm trying to show you.  What are you trying to show us?  Doesn't he ever get sick?  You get sick, and one just doesn't come in?  Yeah, we kind of do that from time to time.  Yeah, so here, let him go.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Nice seeing you.  No, but the show's just over.  He don't hang.  What else can we possibly do with this?  He used to hang.  He never hung.  We used to sweatshirt.  He never hung.  We could go to Conway's. 
[04:02:00]  He literally is walking out on you.  Have you gone to Conway's?  Ant, have a good weekend.  Take it easy, everybody.  Have a good weekend.  You see?  You see?  Good to see you again, my friend.  Thank you.  Come in.  Yeah.  Give me a hug.  Good man.  Good man.  All right.  You're very funny.  Good to see you.  Very funny today.  All right.  You're a good boy.  You were funny.  You were a good boy.  All right.  You gave him extra talent.  Tyce, you leave now.  You leave now.  You want me to leave, too?  Yeah, we all just leave now.  Give me a call.  All right.  How do you?  Whatever you're doing on the weekend, you'll be in Huntington?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe tonight. 
[04:02:30]  Maybe you'll pop into FH.  Yeah.  Tyce is at the old Westbury Music Theater tomorrow night.  Let's just call it the old Westbury Music Theater.  People know where that is, Tyce.  You know what?  I don't care what they're called.  I'm walking out now.  One show only, 8 p.m.  I walk out.  You do that now.  All right.  I'll go.  Why would you leave me like this?  Just talk to the people.  Make a speech.  Make a speech.  Why would you do this to me?  I'll make a speech, yeah.  All right.  You make a speech.  I walk out.  You make the speech.  Because you're a Megatron. 
[04:03:00]  I'm talking to all the people listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is to all the Opie and Anthony fans, which won't make it onto the show.  It will.  If it's a good speech, it'll make it onto the show.  Because this is the thing.  They have left me all alone in this studio to make a speech.  The show went very well today.  Now, I wasn't here for the first part of it, but I didn't have to be because I don't believe 
[04:03:30]  that anybody should have to get up early.  Anybody should have to get on the freeways, get in their cars.  I actually preach to my children.  I go, let me tell you something.  It's not your job at 14 and 18 years old to just, you know, like I tell my kids a lot  of times, you know, do the dishes, take out the garbage.  And my kid said to me, that's not my job, Dad. 
[04:04:00]  That's not the things I think about.  I go, why are the towels on the floor?  And he go, I don't think about it.  I'm 18.  And I said, you know what?  You're right.  I'm wrong.  I had you, you know, my, one of my children is a certified barista.  You know, that's his love.  And I tell him, I should pick up the check.  I go, when you're off from school, when you're off, when you're not working, lay around.  Don't get up at 10 in the morning like everybody else and get things done. 
[04:04:30]  That's not your job at 18.  Your job is to lay around, do what you feel like.  If you feel like doing something, do it.  If you want to go to school, do it.  If you don't like school, fuck them all.  That's what I say.  Fuck them all.  Fuck the teachers.  Fuck people telling you, pick up.  Who's your favorite author?  Who gives a fuck?  Whack your bag.  Go back to fucking sleep.  Wake up.  Eat something. 
[04:05:00]  Whack your bag again.  Take a walk around the neighborhood.  Get some visuals of chicks with big tits, white shorts, separating their fucking box lips.  Come home, whack your bag again.  And now, once you've proven yourself that you're a professional bag, while you walk around,  now you start picking them up.  Now you start talking to them.  Now you start charming them.  Oh, you look beautiful today.  Did anybody say that to you?  See, a lot of pretty girls, they think, oh, he's too scared to come over to me. 
[04:05:30]  Don't let the beauty fucking scare you.  What are you going to go over?  The ugly fat girls?  Take your shots.  It's a numbers game, guys.  Get out there.  Get the big tits.  Get the giant oversized nipples.  Get the pants up their ass.  Fuck the ones you really want to fuck.  That's my speech.  God bless.  That's it?  That's it.  It's inspirational. 
[04:06:00]  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That scares me.  Me too.  Hold on. </pre>
