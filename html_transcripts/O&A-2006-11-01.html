<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Halloween show, broadcast live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, was a chaotic and highly irreverent extravaganza.  Pre-show, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, arriving in classic cars courtesy of the Classic Car Club of Manhattan (who received a plug), discussed logistical improvements from the previous year's near-disaster (a team member suffered a heart attack).  They observed crowd costumes, including one of Jim Norton in his "rot gut days" and another as a proctologist with oddly colored fingers. Norton discussed a recent doctor's visit revealing excessive earwax and his upcoming appearance on *The Late Show with David Letterman*.  Backstage, guests included Colin Quinn (dressed as an African medicine man), Patrice O'Neal, Rich Voss, Bonnie, Jaime, and the surprise performer, Flavor Flav.  The hosts detailed planned contests: a costume contest (with show-related themes), a "bobbing for marital aids" contest (featuring cow parts and cream corn), a candy-eating contest, and a "glue trap mummy" contest.  Significant banter ensued, targeting each other's appearances and personal lives. Rich Voss, sent into the crowd to report on costumes, struggled to communicate over the noise, offering crude and offensive commentary on various costumes.  The presence of strippers in costume was also noted.

The show opened with "Club Soda Kenny" performing a karaoke version of "Monster Mash," followed by an identical audience member. Opie's wizard costume was discussed, referencing explicit websites.  The on-stage portion began with a cake mishap and the unveiling of Jim Norton as a "mystery guest." Several women joined the hosts onstage, leading to flashing and suggestive behavior.  The audience, heavily intoxicated, frequently used racist and antisemitic slurs.  Comedians Colin Quinn, Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neal, and Bob Kelly were guests.  "Tippy Tom," a visibly intoxicated homeless man, interacted unpredictably with the hosts and audience.

The "bobbing for marital aids" contest, featuring scantily clad contestants retrieving "marital aids," cow parts, and other items from bins of water, was won by a "devil angel."  The "glue trap mummy" contest involved intoxicated contestants covering themselves in glue traps; one contestant notably had a trap stuck in his beard.  Flavor Flav's surprise appearance involved his performance and interactions with the overwhelmingly white audience, provoking comments from him and his entourage.  There were tense and humorous exchanges between the hosts and Flav's entourage, including a racist joke by Rich Voss about Flavor Flav's chant.  A nearly naked, very drunk audience member ("Neo") with a medical condition also interacted with the hosts and audience.  Anthony sang "Sweet Caroline."  The costume contest featured numerous bizarre entries, including a "No Filter Paul" in blackface as Flavor Flav,  "Jimmy's tender sentiments" (a destroyed box), a Borat impersonator, and a contestant portraying a rape and murder victim. A large, disruptive contestant was ejected by Opie. Winners received prizes sponsored by MajorWorld.com and Rob Zombie.  The show thanked sponsors including MySexyStore.com, Classic Car Club, Mr. Pest Jr., Ron and Fez, and various comedians.  Jim Norton's *Late Show* appearance was again promoted. The planned candy-eating contest was skipped due to the night's unscheduled events.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts used profanity and sexually suggestive language, reflecting the overall chaotic and highly intoxicated atmosphere.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Halloween Show  with Jim Norton from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square in New York City. 
[00:00:30]  Featuring special guests we can't mention because they might get too drunk and not show up.  The O&A Costume Contest.  Bobbing for marital aids.  A candy contest.  No, not nose candy.  Glue Trap Mummy.  Stand-up comedy.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Maybe some wowing.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Halloween Show from the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let it all out.  These are the things that I do without.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm talking to you.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Are we going to make believe that we're actually live on the radio today?  Let's attempt.  Okay.  To actually make believe.  Yeah, yeah.  Pretend.  They're not going to believe that.  That this is the morning and we're here and we're just like, what time is it? 
[00:01:30]  It's, well, look at the clock.  It's a little blurry, but it's the morning.  It's the morning.  Oh, screw that.  Let me have some orange juice.  Hold on.  Let me take a sip of my orange juice.  Nice dark orange juice with my head on it.  That's a good dark orange juice made by the fine people at Guinness, I believe.  Man, I, uh, never mind.  Good breakfast drink.  I, uh, I left something that looked very similar to that.  Yeah.  In the old, you know what, before we started broadcasting. 
[00:02:00]  You figure that out at home.  That's healthy when it's that dark, too.  That means it's loaded with blood.  Congratulations.  Three days left to live.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We are backstage at the Hard Rock Cafe getting ready for our Halloween party.  The O&A Halloween party.  The big Halloween extravaganza.  Yeah, people are being, uh, let into the Hard Rock as we just kind of hang out back here  and get our thoughts together.  So we thought we'd do the first break here, set up the whole thing, and then we'll broadcast  on that stage in front of all those animals.  Anything that's different from the experiment that was last year, uh, for the Halloween show. 
[00:02:30]  Remember that?  Mm-hmm.  All we did was the curtains opened, uh, we were on the stage trying to broadcast, and  it was pandemonium.  There was no way to do a radio show that way.  Did you know if Fez tried to help us in this?  Oh, they tried, and Fez had a heart attack.  That's, that's how bad it was last year.  Yeah, he blames.  A member of the team had a heart attack.  He blames last year's Halloween party on his, uh, on his heart attack that he ended up having.  It was, the pressure of having to do that, uh, was too much. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  So we figured logistically we would do it a little different this year, come into the dressing  room, not be out with the animals, uh, for the first break, and then slowly work our  way in to the creatures and beasts that are our fans.  An hour from now, we should just wave and then come back in for an hour.  Just kind of open the curtain a little and wave out.  You'd be really arrogant about it.  We'll be coming up.  Opie and Anthony and Jimmy, we'll see you in a couple of minutes.  Please stay out there, people.  And just do nothing but stay back here.  We should turn the music off and make them just stand there in the quiet. 
[00:03:30]  They're broadcasting.  Torture those tools.  I'll stand there in their hot, stupid outfits.  Hey, the costumes are great.  Yeah, I saw a few costumes out there.  I tried to just, uh, leave the car and bolt inside.  Uh, saw a few costumes.  Wait, did you say car?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, here we go.  It's already started.  Wow.  How long in before Opie has to throw a plug out?  Oh, my God.  Two minutes.  I got a list of plugs.  You said car, so I have to say thanks for the lift from the great guys at the Classic Car Club of Manhattan, 
[00:04:00]  where for less than what it costs to park a car in the city,  you could become a member and drive any of their fantastic cars,  from Rolls-Royce to Ferrari, vintage muscle cars to new super exotics.  You could drive them all.  Call 212-229-2402 or visit www.classiccarclub.com for more info.  Coming soon to L.A. and Miami in 2007.  I heard you rolled up in a Rolls-Royce.  Yeah, yeah, convertible.  Had an old, uh, Impala.  Yeah? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Well, it was an Impala.  Right there, Keith?  Uh, yeah, 67 Supersport.  67 Supersport.  Big, huge engine with headers on it.  Mm-hmm.  They couldn't even talk.  It sounded like, you ever talking to a fan?  Buh, not a fan.  A fan.  Talking to a fan.  All right, Jim, go.  There's a few fans you've talked into.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a hair in my mouth.  I think it sounded something like this. 
[00:05:00]  We're like, this couldn't be mine.  Boot in the gut.  Yeah, so we rolled up in some fancy cars outside the Hard Rock.  Fancy schmancy.  Saw the, uh, the line with a few of the, um, uh, people that I'm sure will be contestants  in the big, uh, costume party.  A couple of people is Pal Talk screens.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All I saw was a giant set of cans, um, in a Pal Talk, uh, square.  Nice.  So, uh, people doing show-related stuff.  Apparently there's a girl that is dressed like me from my rot gut days. 
[00:05:30]  With big afro and a goatee.  Oh, that's great.  I hope she had to put it on with some, uh, glue.  Yeah.  And it's not just her natural facial hair.  I saw someone dressed as me.  It said, board up on the back of his, uh, brown t-shirt.  And then the destroyer in the front, he's wearing sunglasses and he's got my hair and everything.  Nice.  I saw a, uh, proctologist with a, uh, with a glove.  Oh, good.  And, uh, let's just keep it friendly here.  Uh, two of the fingers were a different color on the glove. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, interesting.  Red or a green.  I'll see them.  I'll see them later.  Let's just keep it at that so maybe they're at the radio.  They weren't primary colors.  No, no.  No, they weren't.  I believe they're a fan of earth tones.  A little mixture.  Speaking of which, you went and, uh, you know, got your checkup and then the doctor called today?  The doctor calls, uh, as I'm trying to take my little nap so, uh, we can do this show today.  Uh, and the doctor calls and there's nothing worse than, um, the day after your exam when you get a call and it's like the doctor wants to speak to you. 
[00:06:30]  Like, oh, that's great.  Because you know me, I can't even watch, like, house.  On an all new house, it gets me all paranoid.  I think I have some disease.  So, uh, he calls and says, uh, he wanted to talk to me and leaves it on my message.  So I got to call him back and, you know, you're worrying the whole time.  And he goes, I forgot to, uh, to, to give you the prescription for your ears.  Ears?  Apparently.  I have a waxy buildup in my ears.  A waxy buildup. 
[00:07:00]  You Q-tip when you get out of the shower?  Yes, that's what I told him.  And he goes, you're just making it worse.  You're pushing it in.  He said, I'm not tamping it with a cannon pole.  I'm trying.  I, I, I use them.  How are you supposed to use a goddamn, uh, Q-tip?  It's a muscular.  Yeah, no.  I'm shoving ammo in there and shooting at red coats.  What do you think I'm doing?  You know, but you're onto something.  I think this is, uh, preventing us from going deaf.  Because I've had a hearing problem.  I've had a hearing problem for many, many years.  I'll crash me in the mix.  Uh, someone add a crash in. 
[00:07:30]  They will.  They will in, in post.  Of course, do it in post.  In post prod.  I don't know.  I can't hear myself.  I have too much wax in my ears.  Well, after that one, apparently, you're lucky.  I didn't hear it that way.  Falling for that gag, Jimmy.  Uh, no, but you're onto something.  Because, uh, you know, I've had a hearing problem for many years.  Now, I'm starting to think that, uh, maybe there's a lot of wax in my ears.  And I don't want it to, to be removed.  See, I like the fact that it's protecting my ears.  Because I turn up my headphones so loud.  You turn them up way too loud.  And that's the problem.  See, with the volume, your ears secretes the wax to protect the delicate eardrum and, 
[00:08:00]  and things in there.  But you can't just have it in there.  Because then when you're off the air, you're constantly going, what?  I find myself doing that.  What?  What?  I'm like, what do you say?  That old commercial where the old couple's watching a movie.  Yeah.  And the old codger's all mad because he can't hear it.  He's got to turn to his wife who's just pissed at him, you know, because he keeps turning around.  What?  What do you say?  I can't hear the movie.  So I got to put drops in my ears and then go to him.  And what kind of, what kind of archaic technique is used to pull wax out of your ear? 
[00:08:30]  Like a vice and a toilet snake.  You made me pop your eye out.  For ear wax?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I got, I got, I got to do that.  But I'm thinking now if that's done, I'm going to be able to turn my volume down and maybe  you could do the same.  I'll look into it, I guess.  He's going to wait until it's three inches out of his ear.  Right.  Just this big tube of wax, squishing your headphones in there, squeeze it out like peanut butter.  Hello, Mr. Come down and eat it. 
[00:09:00]  Why not?  A contest.  You got to get a picture of it, dude.  You got to put it up.  What?  Yeah, I'm going to.  By the way, Jimmy, where were you?  Oh, it was at the headquarters strip club.  Yeah.  I was doing a, I was doing a.  This early?  Wow.  No, I was doing a photo shoot.  See, we're not doing that gag anymore.  I'm trying to play it up.  I know.  It's not working.  We're sleeping as you listen to this.  I'm going to be on the cover of Steppin' Out.  Oh, really?  Are you?  Tuesday, yeah.  Wow, coming out and now Steppin' Out.  No, no, no.  Oh.  Cut it out.  Oh, yo, you're fresh.  What?  Oh, sorry.  Wax. 
[00:09:30]  Steppin' Out magazine in New York City.  That's real cool.  Yeah, I actually like the club.  I've never been to headquarters before, but there was one girl who was really, really sexy that  I did the shoot with, so.  I hope so.  Yeah.  It'll be awful if she's really fat.  Pictures of me kicking her and wanting my money back.  Can you give the shot away?  What?  No, because I don't know which one we're going to use yet.  Okay.  I don't know which one we're going to use.  They didn't do one for safety, did they?  No, that's the one you never fall for.  They tried to do it with the tranny commercial.  Just do one without the tranny for safety.  I'm like, do you think I'm doing this 10 minutes?  No.  The safety, that's the one we're going to use.  Of course it is.  I don't like those other ones. 
[00:10:00]  Just me and my stupid robe.  So you're down there, and was she semi-clad or fully clad?  Bikini.  Like a thong.  Yeah, she was really cool.  You don't see her face once.  No?  Yeah, it was just her ass.  She was very sexy.  Oh, that's very...  Oh, I can figure out what the shot's going to be.  Are you ready for Letterman tonight?  Cheek to cheek.  Oh, tonight.  Oh, it is tonight.  Yeah, see?  That was good.  Thank you.  Yeah, last night after the abominable Hard Rock broadcast.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  See, see.  Don't confuse the people.  We haven't done the Halloween party yet.  We're doing it in the morning here. 
[00:10:30]  See, we're still...  We're doing it.  It's happening right now.  Oh, right.  Right, right, right.  As a matter of fact, if you're listening and you're in the New York area, show up.  You'll get in right now.  We're partying hard at the Hard Rock Cafe.  And the password when the bouncer tries to say there's no party is to say something really racist  and push past them.  But tonight, Letterman, that's really exciting for Jim Norton.  Yeah, we'll see how it goes.  Let's hope it's good.  I think it'll go well.  You're a funny man, and I have all the faith in the world.  I had to email my song.  They wanted to know what song I want to walk out to.  What song you picked?  I don't know. 
[00:11:00]  I just said anything Sabbath, preferably Iron Man.  I don't want to see Paul Shaver doing Iron Man.  What a dweeb I'm going to feel like.  Yeah, because the band does it.  That might be a little weird.  Isn't Iron Man a little kind of too popular?  You should pick something a little more.  No, but you want people to know what it is.  Because after five seconds, nobody will recognize any of it, especially with big bands.  Yeah, yeah.  Playing a big band sound.  Isn't that like Dancing Queen?  Everyone knows that.  Well, that's kind of nice, but who can concentrate on the jokes, all that music?  All right, we're backstage here at the Hard Rock Cafe getting ready for the Halloween party.  We're going to do a lot of cool things tonight.  Are we? 
[00:11:30]  I mean this morning, wink, wink.  Yeah.  We're doing Pin the Steak on Nosferatu.  Pin the Steak on Nosferatu.  I saw this being tested at the O&A Institute.  Yeah, well, the lab.  In the lab.  The lab, yes.  At the Institute.  I saw some of the interns working on the Pin the Steak on Nosferatu.  Nosferatu is one of our interns.  Striking resemblance, Nosferatu.  What did he come as?  We're dressing him up as Nosferatu.  As Nosferatu.  Oh, okay, good.  He dressed him as a live human. 
[00:12:00]  It takes nothing.  What do you have?  Would you have to darken up his skin and clip his fingernails?  Oh, they just got teeth for him.  That's it.  Just got teeth.  Yeah, that's all they needed to complete the costume.  Yeah, so I'm working on some of those things.  So you saw them practicing this in the O&A lab?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're using some type of bow and arrow device to deliver this steak to his heart.  Okay.  And I guess if you get closest to the heart, which would kill Nosferatu, blah, blah, blah,  you win. 
[00:12:30]  Win a prize.  How much?  What do they get?  I don't know.  It's like $300.  $50?  I don't know.  Cheap.  How great would it be if you lost an eye?  That's worth $50.  Drunk can have $50.  No, it's...  Oh, yeah.  It is $50.  I thought you guys were kidding.  We got some great prize money this year for the show, but...  Yeah.  They didn't for that contest.  That's the throwaway contest, obviously.  Yeah.  And then we're doing bobbing for marital aids.  Oh, Jesus.  We got to keep it clean because we're on free account right now. 
[00:13:00]  Marital aids.  Yeah.  It's a timed event for contestants.  Yes, Jimmy?  I couldn't think fast enough, but it's just...  Robert Reed, I almost tripped over it.  We got four contestants, two male, two female in front of a table with clear rubbermaid bins,  each with ten of these.  Marital aids.  Ten of these.  Yeah.  These are things that perk up anyone's marriage.  There you go.  I believe is what a marital aid would be.  It's a rowboat.  In shallow waters.  Cinder block. 
[00:13:30]  Supplied by MySexyStore.com.  Hands behind backs.  The contestants will attempt to get as many in their mouth.  It's like bobbing for apples, which is a traditional Halloween event, only with marital aids.  But there is a twist.  And we can say the twist because no one's hearing this right now.  They're out in the Hard Rock Cafe.  Hey, Dan, what's the twist on the contest?  Cow parts in the bins with the marital aids.  Wait, what?  Cow parts?  Yes.  Such as, yes, tongues, hearts, et cetera. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, like meat.  Yes.  This is almost like a fear factor kind of thing.  So that's really going to gross people out.  That is disgusting.  Floating in water?  Yes.  Oh, so all the, like, life juices drain out and it just takes on this grayish, white, pale tone.  And they'll be blindfolded, so they have to really bite to find out if.  That is, do I have aids or something else?  That is good.  And they're not going to know that stuff's in there, obviously.  No.  And I'm hearing something about cream corn.  That's news to me, but that sounds pretty good.  I'm hearing they're going to throw a bunch of cream corn in the bin as well. 
[00:14:30]  And cream corn stinks under optimum circumstances.  Yeah.  All right, what else we got?  Optimum.  I don't know.  We got a candy eating contest.  That sounds innocent.  That sounds too innocent.  That sounds a little too innocent.  Yeah.  A candy eating.  Oh, until perhaps they eat too much candy and throw up.  Then it's fine.  I don't know why Patrick Monaki eat candy until his toes just fall off.  You want to hear Plink, like in Escape from Alcatraz, and they threw the fingers on Mr. Zimmerman's desk. 
[00:15:00]  And then we got the glue trap mummy.  That's the best shape I've seen him in.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's Colin Quinn, isn't it?  It has to be Colin Quinn.  Is that?  Yeah, Colin Quinn has showed up in a costume.  He's dressed as some type of, like, medicine man.  What is that?  African medicine man.  Wait, wait, come here.  He's Patrice's doctor.  Patrice's doctor.  He's dressed as some kind of, like, African medicine man.  Why isn't everyone dressed in Halloween outfits?  I thought it was Halloween. 
[00:15:30]  Well, we got some stuff, some costumes.  Things have been kidding all of us, you know?  Haven't?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Except for the certain few that have to wear ankle bracelets and stay home tonight.  Doesn't bring the kids out for them.  Poor lads.  Very good.  Colin's here.  Colin's here.  We got Patrice O'Neal over there.  We got Rich Voss over there.  Bonnie and Jaime.  Right.  We got a whole crowd back here.  What is he doing?  He's just a medicine man.  I'm dressed in a Halloween costume I bought at Ricky's. 
[00:16:00]  That's a good job.  He's got a machete and a club.  Hey, Ed.  Mooga, mooga.  Yeah.  Moving on.  We got the glue trap mummy thing we're doing.  Who can explain the glue trap mummy contest?  Steve, do you want to explain this?  You don't know good radio when you see it, don't you?  Let Steve explain it.  All right, we have the glue trap mummy is we have basically glue traps that were donated,  those rat traps, I guess, and we're going to have contestants in a timed event apply those 
[00:16:30]  to their bodies as quickly as humanly possible.  And, Stan, am I right?  At the end of that time, whatever it is, two, three minutes, we're going to count how many  they have on their body and see how many.  But doesn't the winner have to rip them off or something?  There's a ripping off portion.  There would have to be a ripping off of a trap.  Of course, because that takes skin, hair, everything with it.  Right.  That's going to be great.  They win lots of money.  Do they win?  It's just a cash thing.  Yeah, $350 for first prize. 
[00:17:00]  For bragging rights.  The nerve of us.  No cute prizes.  Nothing.  And then we got the costume contest, which is always a favorite because it's costumes  that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And then we got Flavor Flav performing today.  Yes.  That is going to be very, very cool.  The Flav.  What's he going to do?  Huh?  What's he doing?  He's doing his new stuff.  Patrice, why don't you grab a mic?  Throw a mic over there.  All the stuff that K-Fed doesn't do.  K-Fed.  They had to cancel a bunch of K-Fed shows, apparently.  Oh, I love him.  Yeah, ticket sales were a little down. 
[00:17:30]  Oof.  A little off.  I don't appreciate artistry anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No one appreciates it.  He's like the boss of rap.  He's the boss of rap.  Colin.  What did you say?  I said, Rich Voss is the K-Fed of comedy.  Barney's like Britney.  He's basically a white trash kind of, you know, you're waiting to see the rat tail.  Even if it's not there, you know it should be there.  What else?  What else?  Oh, I wish I could come up with something. 
[00:18:00]  Yes.  I like how you're really committed to the costume.  And he's got like this grass skirt on.  But look.  There's black jeans underneath.  But look what I have.  Boots.  Did you just, I even put those on.  It took me 10 minutes of my gut.  You cooked up a white abuana in a pot and stole his jeans.  If you people saw this costume, you'd know what great radio really is all about.  Yeah, the visual aspect of it.  You're going to see it later.  We're taking all sorts of pictures and video.  Oh, it ends up.  Hey, Rich, you got anything?  No.  No.  Of course not.  Grab a mic and stay on.  Nothing.  I'm Rich. 
[00:18:30]  Here, here, here.  What's going on?  Happy Halloween.  Kitty Mike.  Happy Halloween.  Happy Halloween.  What do you say?  Happy Halloween.  What are we, five-year-olds that just knocked on your door, you idiot?  Happy Halloween.  Have some treats.  Mommy, it was nice out.  Why is it raining now?  Freaking rich.  Hey, did you check out the FHM magazine? 
[00:19:00]  It's so cool, man.  It's cool, right?  Yeah.  Did you see the magazine?  Oh, Colin's not in it.  No.  Well, this is going to be awkward now.  Well, because we didn't have the page space.  It's cool.  Get a mic on.  Get a mic on Colin.  He's killing it.  No one's hearing him.  Unfortunately, they're fighting with each other, so they can't share a mic.  Every time I see Bonnie and Winfrey to go, you know what?  This is it.  I've had it with the marriage.  I guess you've got to catch her after like four drinks when she's like, I can't do this 
[00:19:30]  much longer.  I thought he made more than $1,400 a week headlining.  The guy's been doing it for 25 years.  What was that?  Hush.  Oh, man.  Let me.  I'm not killing you.  I mean, if it lasts one month, that's two more weeks in your marriage.  Oh.  That's uncalled for.  Let's tell me a lie.  Jesus Christ.  Let's tell me a lie.  You guys got divorced on a honeymoon.  No. 
[00:20:00]  Let's tell me a lie.  Yeah.  Wait, what, what, what, what?  That should have been like the 10th one in.  That was definitely a little too soon in the round.  Oh, really?  In the round.  Yeah.  Christ sakes.  That was the old 1980s Tyson.  Just walked out and bow.  Could you eat one and put him on the canvas?  Why don't you just make fun of how fat he's gotten?  No.  No.  I thought it was like Orson Welles. 
[00:20:30]  Who are you for Halloween?  Robert Kelly?  I like that one.  Jesus.  Oh, now we're in the car.  I don't know if you're in the car.  He's getting confident now.  What happened?  Why your mama got kicked?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Bob is known to take it up a notch, isn't he?  As much as he's taking his weight up to 290.  Wow.  Oh, but, uh, Rich, it's good to see you. 
[00:21:00]  What time's Billy Berg in here?  I'm joking, for Christ's sakes.  You guys really do worship that red-headed fool.  Worship?  I go, what time's he getting here?  Like, he's, nah, forget it.  Oh, boy, the star of YouTube.  Screw him, too.  I'm sick of his attitude.  Star of YouTube?  I heard they had to pay him.  Google had to pay him off when they bought the...  Nothing?  Nothing.  Oh, no.  All right, listen.  Bonnie, it's good to see you. 
[00:21:30]  I miss the girl in the corner at the Cure concert.  But listen.  Anyway.  Great radio.  She looks adorable.  She looks gorgeous, but it's kind of a goth, depressed look.  I wonder what that's from.  I know where the depressed comes from.  What did I do?  She was in California, you know, dating, like, alternative guys.  She had free access to Zach Galifianakis' house anytime she wanted.  And now she's in the back of, like, Jimmy's, uh, Jimmy Reed's Comedy Alley outside of Demarest waiting for this idiot to get off stage. 
[00:22:00]  Well, you two are just brutal.  It's going to be a great night, man.  It's just brutal to each other.  All right, listen.  We've got to take our first break.  It's not even mean.  It's just mean.  It's not even good-natured ribbing.  Yes, it is.  It's personal, man.  It's not personal, man.  It's Patrice sitting there with the girl that's suing Benzino at Source Magazine.  Patrice's girl. 
[00:22:30]  We see her once a year.  Be nice.  He takes her out once a year on Halloween.  Helena.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  We've got to take a break.  When we get back, are we going to hit the stage?  Is that what's going to happen?  I think that's the plan of action.  Or should we do another break from here?  I would do this all night long.  The thought of stepping in front of those animals.  Yeah, we're going to figure it out.  I'll be Hitchcock when he wants to do it.  He is shaped like a mystery director. 
[00:23:00]  I really am finished.  Oh, Colin.  You are being hammered.  He's sitting right here.  Somebody came in with food.  Three plates of food over to Colin.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Halloween show is brought to you by Saw 3.  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw in theaters everywhere.  We're going to take a quick break.  We might do a little more from backstage, or we'll hit the stage.  We don't know what's going on. 
[00:23:30]  We're at the Hard Rock Cafe.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll be back with more of the 2006 Opie and Anthony Halloween show  live from the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman tonight on CBS.  Check local listings for Showtime.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We now return to the Opie and Anthony Halloween party  from the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City.  This is for you, Buttercup. 
[00:24:00]  Sponsored by Saw 3.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're still backstage at the Hard Rock Cafe getting ready for our Halloween party.  And, uh...  Yeah, we were going to go out, but then we said, uh, screw it.  Yeah.  Let's stay back here a little longer.  Well, the drinks arrived.  Yeah.  We got the comfortable couch.  Right.  We're still waiting for, uh, everyone else to show up, like Bob Kelly and Flavor Flav.  He's playing later on.  Yeah.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  Is he here yet?  Club Soda Kenny's, uh, stuffing his face over there. 
[00:24:30]  I accidentally see, last Halloween...  Well, let's see a Bonnie Raitt video on.  Woo!  Colin's commenting on the bad videos that are playing.  We saw Tears for Fears earlier.  I know.  We got a flash screen in the, uh, the dressing room here, and it's all bad 80s video, so...  I, uh, now, if you remember last year, we had the other dressing room, the smaller one.  Yeah.  Because, uh, I guess, uh, Hogan, Hulk Hogan was here.  Right.  And he got this big one.  So, I automatically went to the one we went to last year, and, and that's where Flav is staying.  Who did I feel out of place? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, gee.  I walked in, and, and before I knew it, I was in the middle of the room, and I just went,  Hi, gentlemen!  And then left.  I'm so afraid.  Because I'm scared of black people.  Is there a lot in there?  Uh, well...  You should have brought your Nazi paraphernalia.  Yeah.  It's Halloween.  Why dress like I do every day?  Yeah.  Yeah, you were reaching for the lights, and you realized the lights were on.  All right, so we got Rich Voss.  You gonna go out into the crowd and see what kind of costumes we got?  Go see what we got out here, yeah. 
[00:25:30]  All right, start walking, Rich Voss.  This should be mediocre.  I know.  We bring you cum.  I'll forget it.  Oh, shut up.  Colin is just now wrapped around Bonnie.  That's all right.  That's right.  I want to save her from the awfulness of Voss.  She's very depressed.  She's not depressed.  She's as happy as she ever was.  I know you do, but you look like you did when you were 13.  Oh, there's a security costume right here.  Oh, he's a security guard.  Wow, it's really loud out there.  You can barely hear anything.  Can you hear any of this?  We have a... 
[00:26:00]  Hold on.  We got this guy.  What's your name?  Steve.  Steve, what are you?  I'm a LARPer.  I don't know.  He really let them have it and camped them.  He's a LARPer.  He looks like a gladiator.  He's like a gladiator.  They don't always call him candy all day.  Look how...  You're too fat to be a gladiator.  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you.  It's hard to hear.  Oh, hold on.  We got a black ninja.  Why are you even wearing a costume?  He's on the black ninja, man.  This is so cool right here. 
[00:26:30]  This guy's got all black on.  Hold on.  He's got all black on, and just his eyes are showing.  I'm going to talk to you about this.  I'm a black ninja.  F-face right here.  What's your name?  I'm saying, you know, if I have some diabetes...  Hey, how you doing?  Look at it.  Oh, this is cool.  I can't say this stuff.  No.  This guy...  You can't say this.  You got to see.  This guy's like a...  What is this?  A toilet...  Oh, not so tender sentiment.  This is a good one right here.  With a Norton picture on it.  It's a good costume right here. 
[00:27:00]  I can't say this on the air.  How long do we leave Rich out there to hang?  I don't know.  To just hang himself?  This is killing me.  Don't weep it out.  All right.  This is nice.  Keep it.  There.  Oh, that one's good.  I can't say this.  What's that?  Well, Rich, hint around to it.  He can't hear anything.  I can barely hear it.  He can't say anything.  He can't hear or say anything.  Hold on.  Rich, Rich, Rich.  Wait, wait.  Wait.  No, this is a good one.  Hold on.  Dumbest guy I know.  What's up?  What's your name?  Josh. 
[00:27:30]  Josh, you got a rat trap.  Okay, what you are is a big thing that would be on Norton or Collins' chin at night.  I hear what you said, but no one can hear him.  No one can hear me.  Thank God they can't hear me.  You know what?  Listen.  How's it going?  Are we having a...  You still dodging a little kid for money?  We got an Arabic guy right here.  I guess...  What are you, a terrorist?  Yo, you still dodging a kid for money, boss?  Yes.  Rich, Rich, Rich.  Send him out.  Oh, my God.  We got club soda candy. 
[00:28:00]  We got club soda candy here.  We got a lot of cool outfits out here.  I got to say it.  Bonnie, you should be getting a telegram soon that your husband has died out there in the crowd.  It's...  He's bombing.  I'm not bombing.  I'm doing what I can.  I can't hear.  You got...  You know what?  I'm getting sick of sent to the wolves.  We are sorry to inform you of the loss of your husband, Rich Voss.  He was getting big laughs, and then he walked behind the stem and through a sign.  You remember me?  It's hard to do.  We got some dancers out here. 
[00:28:30]  We got some strippers out here.  Strippers with costumes.  What are the odds?  All right.  Colin.  Colin is heading out.  I'm Dustin.  This is horrible.  I'm going back in.  I got you.  Dustin.  He's got a machete and a club.  All right.  Colin's heading out.  This is brutal.  You're doing good, Rich.  Ah, it stinks.  I'm coming back.  Oh, you're killing.  You're killing, Rich.  I can hear everything.  It's fine.  Can you hear this?  All right.  Wow.  Oh, we got a big crowd.  I'm going to do what Rich just did. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, this is really cool.  There's some people.  He's just reporting facts.  There's a floor and a ceiling.  Yeah, there's a nurse over there who I really want to rape.  All right.  This is anticlimactic.  It is.  A bunch of people looking expectantly at an empty stage.  What a disappointment they're into.  I know.  You know how happy it makes me?  There's so many other not-so-tender sentiments.  He's dressed like a box of tender sentiments.  Aw.  Oh, this is fantastic.  You guys are missing quite a party out here. 
[00:29:30]  Yay!  Wow.  Picture complete nothingness with just a lot of people doing it.  Yay!  Let's go on the stages.  And the good thing is none of them have to get up early for work tomorrow.  Let's go on the stage.  Let's go on the stage.  Let's go on the stage.  Let's go on the stage.  Let's go on the stage.  That's great.  Now, we are going to have to go out there.  Yay!  It looks like we were having fun back here, and then we realized we're going to have  to address the crowd.  We sent a recon party out, and now we realize the mercenaries have to go out there and save 
[00:30:00]  us and entertain a crowd of drunken men.  Oh, look at this one.  What a lovely girl.  These are the strippers from New Jersey.  Wow.  I don't think she's a real nurse.  She's not a real nurse.  Don't stop him.  Don't stop him.  Give me a lot of pictures.  All right.  Well, this sucks.  Let's go inside.  This is awful.  They're yelling at boss.  Hold on.  Talk to the girls.  Oh, you talk to the girls, Colin.  What are you going to say to them?  Colin, what are you going to say, Colin?  Got something to eat?  Exactly.  Why all the fat jokes?  I don't know.  Why all the fat jokes? 
[00:30:30]  We're done.  Yeah, that was fun.  That was...  Colin's doing a show about his eating.  It's called Remote Lack of Control.  All right.  I don't know how much we're going to use of that.  That was magic.  It was awful.  Nothing you could do.  All right.  We're going to...  Just too loud and...  You can't get any conversation.  What's the feel of the people out there?  Are they intoxicated?  Are they...  They seem like they're normal.  They're not out of control yet.  They're not at the Billy stage. 
[00:31:00]  You know what I mean?  They are expecting us to get out there, and they're just looking at the stage.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  They're just looking at an empty stage.  I'm here for JB and Elvis.  They came for you two.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  We're going to break.  I think we're going to start the party next.  Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.  I mean, just from our little step out into that, we can just see the magic.  It's going to be happening.  Wow.  And now Earl just walked in.  Things are being kicked up into another gear.  We had to test the water.  And Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  You were able to tell from his costume.  Hey, Ron and Fez. 
[00:31:30]  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  He's wearing a patch over his eye.  Yeah, very nice.  Who are you with a patch?  I'm nobody.  Just a guy who got stuck in the eye real quick.  You're like a casual pirate.  And thank you very much.  Now, Fezzy's here.  Do not call him Matt Foley.  A lot of people have made that mistake.  Oh.  Well, you're looking more and more like Sam Kinison.  Thank you very much.  But that was after he died.  After he died.  Oh, my God.  Fezzy?  What are we on now?  Are we on satellite or terrestrial?  This is terrestrial. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  So I can't say what I wanted to tell you.  But I'll just say the women have improved.  Oh, okay.  Since last year.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  A lot of hot women.  Now, that's good to know.  I know.  It's really going downhill.  Yeah.  You're the ravage now.  And I know you have one of these contests tonight.  We want Fezzy involved for the dunking, for the bobbing.  Oh, bobbing.  Yeah.  Bobbing for marital.  There you go.  I didn't know what to call it.  Is that how we say it?  Yeah.  Why what?  What did Colin say?  He's doing a Matt Foley joke on him.  He is not Matt Foley. 
[00:32:30]  Look at that.  He's not Matt Foley.  I'm Clark Kent.  I'm not Matt Foley.  He's got the little spit curl.  And there's the other thing.  One year since Fez had his heart attack.  I know.  Because open your shirt up.  Let me see what that says.  That is actually stent man.  Yeah.  It is.  We talked about that already.  Yes.  It was a year ago that.  That Opie was blamed for your heart attack.  Exactly.  The stress.  I'm just going to lay back this time.  I don't know what happened.  Relax.  No pressure.  No pressure.  We didn't really explain this during the first break.  We decided to hang out backstage for a really long time. 
[00:33:00]  And Ron and Fez were supposed to fill.  Right.  And we told him.  Stay with the new kids on the block.  We're like 15, 20 minutes.  We'll be out there.  Don't worry.  Like two hours later.  Like we're getting notes.  Fez is freaking out.  He's sweating and having chest pains.  And we're like, we're just sitting back here doing Jaeger shots.  Right.  Is there any way to get them on stage?  His left arm is going numb.  And we're like, ah, another shot.  Leave him out there.  This year, I've taken the precaution to step on the coke.  So don't worry about it.  Oh, did you? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, you stepped on it.  Mainly, it's mannitol at this point.  Baby laxative?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  That'll do the trick.  Because obviously, you can't take the pure stuff.  And Foss actually went, I don't care.  I'll still do something.  Tell him it's cut with Clorox.  It doesn't matter.  I'm still ready.  Yeah, Foss just made that universal signal for toot in the bathroom.  Yeah, right.  Call you in the bathroom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He touched his nose.  He touched your nose.  You guys walk through the crowd.  Give us the feel.  We haven't been out there yet.  Rich Foss tried, and he failed miserably.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I didn't fail. 
[00:34:00]  The audience failed.  Was that your teeth flowing out there?  Yes.  Jeez, that's not right.  What's the feel out there, Ron?  I thought he was dressed like the Berlin Wall.  I will say this.  For an O&A gig, I never saw so many beautiful women.  I don't know whether you guys hired them or brought them in.  Well, we cut down on the sex jokes.  Oh, I see what it is.  And when you do that, it seems like women want to listen to your radio show.  We're from sex to domestic violence.  These are good-looking women, too.  This isn't Fatty Pig Fatty crowd out here.  No.  No, this is a good-looking crowd.  I know.  I don't understand it. 
[00:34:30]  Huh?  You've turned everything around.  I think so, yeah.  Thank God for John Minnelli.  Seriously, just a good time.  Right?  It's just a day's time.  I want to welcome you guys also back to the airwaves of CBS Radio right now.  Wow.  I had no idea.  What an announcement.  That's fantastic.  Somebody's sweating in the corner right now.  We're honored.  You're on right now.  I mean, that's...  Wow.  Yeah.  Who knows?  The guy with the tie is hanging himself right now.  Right.  Two days on the job, and he's hanging himself with his own tie. 
[00:35:00]  It's all hot women out there.  Unbelievable.  Nice costumes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody looks that slutty Halloween look.  So you're pulling it off.  Any Ron and Fez costumes out there?  Because I know a lot of the...  We have a lot of crossover audience.  Is that right?  Yeah.  I didn't know.  Is there a big, stupid Dave costume?  Oh, yeah.  There'll be a couple of those.  A couple of those.  But you guys have changed so much in one year.  I can't believe this was a sausage festival last year.  Oh, I know. 
[00:35:30]  Ugliest guy slam dancing to really bad music.  This year, you're going in a whole new direction.  It's classic.  Yeah.  You've got to take the bad with the good.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, Letterman's here.  So be on.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I'm doing my set for the crowd.  I appreciate it.  Yeah.  Five clean minutes.  We're very excited.  Jimmy does Letterman tonight.  Tonight's the night, huh?  Yeah, tonight.  Well, don't confuse me.  No, it's tonight.  Oh, wait.  It's tonight.  Let's just go with it.  It's tonight.  How's you guys?  Thanks for getting up so early and coming in, too. 
[00:36:00]  Well, you know, we felt we had to.  So we're taking off tomorrow.  Oh, we can't.  We can't be in by noon.  No, of course not.  All right.  Bob Kelly has arrived.  What's up, Bob?  Hey there, Bobby.  What are you dressed as?  A failed comedy tour?  Wow.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I like the fact that you've been waiting.  Wow.  I've been here for 10 minutes, and you've been waiting 10 minutes to sell out of that.  That one.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He was just waiting for his spot.  Shortest comic standing. 
[00:36:30]  He's just mean, Bob.  Wow.  Way to hurt someone when they walk in the door.  All right.  They're lying.  And he rolled in.  He just trundled in, and you've got to start with him right away.  Don't say the word trundle.  I'm sorry.  I'm just saying you came in.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  You're in a sketch comedy group now?  You're called Torgasm.  Oh, my goodness.  Tessie had a better welcome at the end of Goodfellas.  Jesus.  I think Voss secretly hates me. 
[00:37:00]  He's jealous.  I'm not going to take you a seat.  You can't.  He's too small.  He's jealous of the big money you made on the tour.  What are you talking about?  He's jealous.  Huh?  What?  What money?  He's jealous of what?  Torgasm?  Did he say he was jealous?  Colin, I don't need you to stick up for me.  Take the freaking mask off, you deaf old man.  Uh-huh.  That's funny.  I don't like.  I actually thought you had a fake torso, and that's actually your real chest.  We hit him with that as soon as he came in.  Yeah.  Really?  You think a room full of comics would miss that? 
[00:37:30]  Come on.  I'll tell you what, Bob.  That was sad.  I guarantee you, I'll give you whatever I have in my pocket financially if that's not a double XL.  All right.  Okay.  Everything you have in your pocket.  You know, you actually could eat $30 and Burger King coupons.  Hey, what happened?  Dane needed his coattails for his costume tonight?  Oh!  That was pretty good.  Rich, it's funny when Anthony does this.  That was pretty good.  Oh, Bob, that hurts.  I'm surprised you didn't do it in a voice. 
[00:38:00]  Let's go toe-to-toe, huh?  Hoo-hoo!  Hoo-hoo!  You can't go toe-to-toe with you.  Toe-toe?  Yeah.  How about?  I can't see my toes.  I got my own joke.  Listen, I'm back to the Queen of England, Colin Quinn.  Wow.  Anthony got greedy.  Bobby Kelly on a hunger strike.  I think it's greedy.  With AIDS.  You're standing right next to your bathroom.  Are you going to go visit your career?  Oh!  Rich Paul with another one!  Wow.  I have to bring my girlfriend with me to make money. 
[00:38:30]  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Oh, no, you're dead!  He did!  Oh, no, you're dead!  Oh, yeah, he did!  Sorry.  Sorry.  I should have said wife.  I'm sorry, Bob.  It worked for you, just in case.  Bonnie had a glimmer of hope thinking, wow, I'm not married to him?  Can I please say something important?  Yes, Colin Quinn.  Bobby looks like a last-minute gift at the Beijing airport.  That's a good one. 
[00:39:00]  That's really good.  Wow.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I love that.  Oh!  I should have.  Oh!  That's a good one.  You're right.  I will.  I'll wait.  I'll wait that one out.  That hurts.  That is funny.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  No, Colin's been saving that one.  That's not what he just thought of.  That's a hot one.  When Byron Allen does that one, it's going to kill. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Sad.  There it is.  Wow.  You know, it's a whole dynamic.  You've got your highs and your lows.  Yeah, well, we were having fun, but you didn't get it.  Now, because of you, we've got to punish the audience with commercials.  Thank you.  Jesus, it was going so well.  I just saw that sweaty handle hit the brake.  Sparks flying out of the train wheels.  All right, we've got to put on a show for these freaks outside.  Yeah, I guess we're going to have to go out there.  We're going to take a break.  We'll hit the stage at the Hard Rock Cafe next. 
[00:40:00]  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  We'll be back with more of the 2006 Opie and Anthony Halloween show live from the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City.

[00:42:00]  That was a really bad idea with the cake.  That was a bad idea with the cake.  I'm trying to spill that cake away.  Oh, it looks like what you left in the bowl this morning or yesterday.  Oh, it's a stage a mess.  Yeah, that was a really dumb idea. 
[00:42:30]  Also, I got to throw my T-shirt out there.  All right.  Oh, the cake.  Oh, the first wow in the front row.  Very nice.  Here you go.  A Paul R. Nelson campaign T-shirt.  We got a mystery guest, Hard Rock Cafe.  A mystery guest.  A mystery guest.  Very scary.  Let's bring him out.  Here he is.  Our mystery guest.  A special mystery guest who will be joining us.  He's so scary. 
[00:43:00]  Too damaged.  Too damaged.  They'll never guess my identity.  They'll never guess my identity.  Sniffle age joke.  Sniffle age joke.  Ha, ha, ha.  And, uh, wow.  You know, Ron and Fez, we're absolutely right.  Wowee.  What a beautiful crowd.  We got some hot women here at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Oh, those are lovely.  We got girls.  Wow.  We got the Robert Reed mask. 
[00:43:30]  Look at Robert Reed.  He's a skeleton.  And he's got a bowl full of broth.  What a good boy.  Wow.  Wow.  Very nice.  We got Baby Girl in the front row.  Wowing.  Is that Baby Girl?  He's going to take it for the website.  Very nice.  Oh, now she's making out.  Now she's making out.  Oh, I hate when that happens, Anthony.  This is just an amazing sight.  We didn't have this last year.  No.  It was just a sausage fest last year.  Absolutely.  And now beautiful girls.  Unbelievable. 
[00:44:00]  We got Happy Typing Girl in the front row.  Yeah, a lot of the pal talk people I see.  God damn, we got a lot of hot women.  Oh, we got a nurse.  They just figured out who the mystery guest is.  They didn't know I was the mystery guest.  Are you kidding me?  Which one of you dumb bastards didn't know it was Jimmy?  You know what it is?  Huh?  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Wow, look at this.  She's showing her breasts.  You are a naughty nurse, aren't you? 
[00:44:30]  You know what?  Why don't we get some of these hot girls on stage?  We got a chocolate cake.  Something could happen.  Something could happen.  Any girls want to come on stage?  Who wants to come on?  A little, uh...  A little wow-ing.  Wow-ing.  Lift up!  Oh, goodness gracious, Jimmy.  Hey, miss.  There you go.  Mitch, would you do that on my chest?  All right.  We got a couple of the hot girls on stage here.  She will not make a copy of the cake on your chest, Jimmy.  We got a naughty nurse on stage.  Lovely.  Oh, look, we have to have a cake cleaner-upper.

[00:45:30]  Wow.  It is Whip Them Out Wednesday.  There you go.  Five really hot girls on stage flashing the crowd here at the Hard Rock Cafe.  No, no, no.  Don't whip me.  We got a dominatrix on stage.  She went right after me.  You know, I really feel like the show is picking up steam and back where it belongs.  Because last year, I think we got one breast exposed.  Wow.  Oh, yes.  And that's because Olivia Newton-John showed up.  Wow.  The crowd is in a frenzy. 
[00:46:00]  Whip Them Out.  Oh, why not?  They're out.  What else?  Wow.  Look at these girls.  These girls are just...  They don't care.  They actually listen to our show.  I'm not used to hot girls listening to the programming.  The hell is going on?  Very nice.  All right.  I love it.  Very good.  Welcome, everybody.  All right.  Let's get the girls off the stage so we can start the broadcast.  Yeah.  Actually, we are broadcasters.  All right, ladies.  Thank you, ladies. 
[00:46:30]  Thank you, girls.  Keep drinking and keep drinking.  I'm going to give these people a real thrill.  That's right.  Do you guys want to see something really sexy?  Oh, boy.  Jimmy is going to moon the crowd.  And there it is.  Oh, a little photo op.  Lots of photo ops tonight at the Hard Rock Cafe, Anthony.  He has smited me with his hairless bottom.  I must...  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  All right.  All right.  What do you want to do next? 
[00:47:00]  You want to do the song from Club So to Kenny to welcome everybody?  You know something?  What a great welcome on this Halloween party.  We've been out here in three minutes, and we're doing the Kenny song already.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  We are finished.  Because it's a great way to open up the show, relax the crowd.  It's a seasonal song, and he's so good at doing it.  Yeah.  It's the Monster Mash.  It's the Monster Mash.  And it's supposedly a Graveyard Smash.  It's the second hit from Club So to Kenny.  Yeah.  The follow-up to Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man. 
[00:47:30]  Here is Kenny's costume.  Well, you have a Kenny's costume.  His face...  Right now, he looks thrilled to be putting this on.  But he's putting it on in front of everybody.  It should be kind of in the back, so they don't know who he is.  Well, look.  Look, now he'll turn around, and they won't know.  I can't believe he's no longer a police officer.  All right.  Club So to Kenny's about ready to do it.  Wow.  They're not happy with me with the cake.  No.  I'm going to try to look at some more of the crowd here.  Wow. 
[00:48:00]  Unbelievable.  Hey, you made it.  That's it.  There's some great costumes out there.  Nice.  It's so good to see some of these girls.  And they're not in little two-inch squares on Pal Talk.  And they have real breasts.  It's amazing and wonderful.  They're like real girls.  All right.  Club So to Kenny, and it's ready for his Monster Mash song.  All right.  How are we going to do this?  Well, there's a... 
[00:48:30]  What are you dressed as, Debbie?  That's happy typing girl.  What are you...  What is she dressed as?  I don't know.  They're all Opance angels.  Oh, very nice.  I like that.  They're crime fighters that fight crime with their genitalia.  I see Monster Mash is ready to go on the karaoke machine.  We have karaoke here.  All right.  Does that mean...  Does that mean later on I might have to do some Neil Diamond?  No.  They don't want to hear Neil Diamond tonight. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Imagine me doing Neil Diamond dressed as a wizard.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hey.  Look at my wizard sleeve.  Look at my wizard sleeve.  It looks like some girls you see on Pal Talk.  Oh, jing-a-miss.  Jimmy likes them like this.  What?  Loose.  The inside of the wizard sleeve.  Nice and big and loose.  All right. 
[00:49:30]  You guys ready to hear Club So to Kenny or what?  Yes.  All right, Kenny.  Why don't you say hi to the crowd first, Kenny?  Hello, everyone, and thank you for coming to the Hard Rock for this Opie and Anthony Little  Jimmy Halloween party.  And now you will hear my rendition of Monster Mash.  Club So to Kenny, everyone.  He looks ridiculous.  He's standing in front of that monitor like a retard in front of a forest wheel. 
[00:50:00]  He did before the costume went on.  It's an A4 intro.  What does that mean?  You'll see the words.  It's almost like follow the bouncing ball.  Don't do it yet.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight.  For my monster from his slam began to rise.  And suddenly, to my surprise, he did the monster mash. 
[00:50:30]  It was a graveyard smash.  It caught on in a flash.  He did the monster mash.  From my lavatory in the castle east.  From my lavatory in the castle east.  To the master bedroom where the vampires speak.  The ghouls all came from the humble abode.  To cats and joke from my electrode.  They did the monster mash. 
[00:51:00]  It was a graveyard smash.  It caught on in a flash.  They did the monster mash.  The zombies were having fun.  The party had just begun.  The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son.  The scene was rocking and we're digging the sound. 
[00:51:30]  Igor on chains backed by baby hounds.  The coffee bangers were all about to rise.  The debacle group, the kick people fight.  They played the monster mash and it was a graveyard smash.  It caught on in a flash.  It's now the monster mash. 
[00:52:00]  Everybody.  Now everything's cool.  Trax a part of the band.  And my monster mash is the head of the land. 
[00:52:30]  For you the living this mash was meant.  When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you.  Then you can monster mash.  And do the graveyard smash.  You're going to do it all day.  You'll clutch on in a flash.  And then you can monster mash.  Oh, monster good.  So don't end.  You have been so monster good.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up. 
[00:53:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, I said.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  He didn't even sing it.  He just did it like it was spoken word.  Yeah.  Reading it.  Did you guys see the Club Soda Kenny guy in the audience?  Yeah, bring him on stage real fast.  He put more emotion reading the Miranda rights to someone he just worked over.  This guy has a Club Soda Kenny like, oh, it's like a costume. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  He's got the suit.  And sand hair.  Wait, give me your Kenny.  This is a photo op for everybody.  We got the real Club Soda Kenny.  And a guy that's the same height as Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  Now, sir.  Sir, what's with the hair you got on?  It's Spanish moss. 
[00:54:00]  Like Club Soda, cigars, and scotch.  Because now, because Kenny has the driest hair ever.  Thank you.  That's right.  Wow, he sounds like you, too.  That's pretty good.  And you have this wonderful mask of Kenny.  Looks just like him.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  This gets cut out.  This gets cut out.  This gets cut out.  Talk Free FM.  Talk Free FM.  Free FM will be supplying the prize money for tonight's Halloween costume party. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Very nice.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Wow.  Your hair feels moist and delicious compared to usual.  All right.  There you go.  Should we take another break and introduce the comedians here?  We'll take a break.  Introduce everybody.  Take a seat.  And continue on with the festivities.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:55:00]  We'll be back with more of the 2006 Opie and Anthony Halloween show live from the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman tonight on CBS.  Check local listings for Showtime.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We now return to the Opie and Anthony Halloween party.  I want to know why we're doing this.  We are so pathetic.  Today's show is sponsored by the letter U. 
[00:55:30]  Sponsored by Saw 3.  And we're back live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  They're mopping the stage, Anthony.  Yes, it was quite the mess.  It was a really stupid idea.  I decided to come on stage with a cake. 
[00:56:00]  Oh my, I earned that cake.  I earned that cake.  And look at my shoes, by the way.  Look at my shoes.  Yeah, your shoes.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Keep them away.  Keep them away.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  Kenny is the...  Go get your effing shine box.  Oh, Kenny.  Here we go.  Kenny is now cleaning Opie's shoes.  You chop his strawberries for him in the morning,  and now you're cleaning chocolate off his shoes.  But he's the perfect guy, because he has such OCD. 
[00:56:30]  I mean, I know they're going to come back, like, spotless.  They must get squeaky clean for GH.  GH needs clean shoes.  Oh my God, the debauchery that's going on in the front row of that audience.  These people are...  Holy mackerel.  These people are so hammered.  Oh.  And they start a chance that were unacceptable for broadcast.  Well, it happens.  Let's see what happens.  I don't know what's going to make the air and what's not going to make the air.  It would be funny if Al didn't catch that.  Yeah, oops. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, well, what happened was, because I don't know if we made the radio,  we had Club Soda Kenny do Monster Mash.  I believe that made the radio.  Oh, it was a beautiful rendition.  And then there was someone out in the audience that was dressed just like Club Soda Kenny,  so we thought to bring him up on the stage and have him meet and talk a little bit.  And in the middle of the conversation, the chant started.  There was an F chant and a C chant, right?  Look at Bob Kelly coming out just introducing himself to the ladies.  Yeah.  Walks right out to the girls.  Look at them. 
[00:57:30]  Working the crowd.  High-fiving.  Aren't we going to introduce these guys?  Well, he decided to just walk out.  And again, they're getting impatient.  I'll tell you if they're part of the stage here.  Dude!  Dude!  Dude!  Get out, dude!  Dude!  Dude!  Dude!  Dude!  All right, we should introduce some of our friends to this madhouse at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Who are we introducing first?  Oh, thank you.  My shoes are clean. 
[00:58:00]  Your shoes are all clean now?  Oh, my God.  Thank you, mister.  Well, I see the wonderful Mr. Colin Quinn.  Yeah, we should give these guys a wireless mic, introduce them, and let them, you know,  kind of address the crowd.  Say hi.  Hey, Steve!  We got a wireless mic for these guys.  Yeah, we got one.  All right, Hard Rock Cafe.  Let's hear it for Colin Quinn.  Oh!  Thank you, folks. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, what a lovely, lovely night it is.  You're supposed to address the crowd, Colin.  What's the matter?  You're supposed to address the crowd a little bit.  We need you to do 20 minutes.  All right, folks.  20.  What a lovely, lovely night it is.  I don't like to compete, but I might go for first call.  You can't hear him through that mask.  No.  No different than normal.  It's actually preferred.  Well, folks, don't tell me that I suck, because I'm not like Billy Burr. 
[00:59:00]  I can't take it.  That guy's off a hook.  All right.  Well, that was wonderful, Colin.  Thank you.  Thanks, Hopi.  Let's say hi to Rich Voss, everyone.  Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Give Rich the wireless mic.  Rich.  Voss, stand up.  Rich Voss.  How cool is this?  Not particularly.  Oh, and there it is, huh?  Jesus, Voss.  I'm going to go Jack. 
[00:59:30]  Good one.  Voss.  They're all chanting Jew.  Voss, that girl wants to show you her breasts.  Oh, is that what it was?  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  What's happening to us?  I don't understand that.  You can't look.  Bonnie's backstage.  She's not allowed to look.  I don't understand what they were chanting.  Yeah.  I thought they saw his teeth and were just saying, Jew.  Jew.  Like, use those things for something.  You got anything for this crowd, Rich?  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Jew.  Wow, this is good.  Welcome to the Halloween party at Archive. 
[01:00:00]  Auschwitz.  Auschwitz.  Auschwitz.  All right.  Very nice.  If Voss exposes his teeth to the wall, guys have people throw up their kegs on it.  All right.  Who else we got backstage?  Who else we got?  I don't know.  How about a hand for Rob?  Where's Patrice?  Where's Patrice?  Patrice?  Where's Patrice?  Reprimanding his girl?  Bob Kelly walked out.  He thought it was his intro.  Patrice.  Yeah, Patrice.  Give Patrice the wireless fight for a second. 
[01:00:30]  Patrice, address the crowd, will you?  Patrice, look at that.  Thank you very much.  Excellent.  All right.  What the hell?  Wow.  Free FM.  Might as well move this.  I think they're just fascinated that you're bigger than all the other people.  I don't think they said bigger.  I think they said the N-word.  And they're very nice.  No, they're saying bigger.  They're saying bigger.  Because, yeah.  And Dikembe Mutombo are not going to put up with them. 
[01:01:00]  Colin came out, and then Rich, and then you're the bigger of the three.  So they were saying bigger, bigger.  I've been banned for all ONA events for a year.  What?  All right.  Oh, that's it.  No, it's not going to happen.  You got it.  All right.  Nice, sensitive audience.  Ooh.  They're being shot by the lovely ladies.  They have guns.  And next, we have a man who's floor-cleaning products I've enjoyed for years.  How about a nice hand for Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Mr. Clean.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Get out, Dad.  Look at those little stand, Patrice.  Look at those little fucking room.  Look at those little raw eggs just for you, Bobbo.  Oh, those are fucking perfect.  Where are they?  Perfect.  Oh, right there.  Baby girl.  Look at him over here.  There is the hottest girl-on-girl action going in front row, man.  Give him a hand.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Give him a big hand for those strippers.  Man, ethnicity to yell at Bobby because he's everything.  Mongrel. 
[01:02:00]  Mongrel.  Who else we have back there?  Otto?  Is Otto back there?  Otto and George?  Yeah.  Yay!  Wow.  Where's Otto?  Where's Otto?  Wow.  Where's Otto?  There you go.  There you go, sweetie.  This guy's wiping his nose.  All right, well.  George demanded things on his rider that he didn't get any left.  Those breasts aren't even a cup.  Wow, look at the ones sitting on the shoulders there.  Look at Nurse Betty back there.  How hot is it?  Wow, fantastic.  These two are going to have sex to it over here.  Hey, listen.  If it's smaller than an A, where does it go? 
[01:02:30]  The lowercase.  Look at that.  All right, are we going to start the first contest?  Just animals.  Have you been looking, though, and kind of seen any prospects for the costume contest?  Yeah.  I'm looking.  Do you see the Flavor Flavor over there?  You know who that is?  Yes.  Do you know who that is?  Who's that?  See Flavor Flavor?  Yeah.  Do you know who that is?  No.  Take a good look at him.  Now I know.  I could tell just by...  No Filter Paul dressed as Flavor Flav. 
[01:03:00]  Wow.  That is a good job, man.  He might win the costume contest.  That really is good.  He did a really good job.  Damn it.  I can't...  I did not know...  I thought that was an actual...  I swear to God if it was a black man.  It's Flavor Flav if he ate the rest of the guys in the band.  Ladies and gentlemen, no filter Paul is Flavor Flav.  Hey, you got a good shot at winning the costume contest, buddy.  You certainly do.  Definitely got a good shot at it.  Something tells me he's very good at putting on blackface.  He does it at home and private and then curses himself in the mirror.  It's the only way his wife will touch him. 
[01:03:30]  I like the fact that he kept his St. Patrick's Day hat.  Yeah.  He could have got a nicer hat for the Halloween show.  Wow, the Paul Sucks chant is going.  That's right.  You can't curse.  You can't curse, you ass.  He's so fat he had to use a grandfather clock to make it look the right size around his neck.  Because I didn't explain it right.  Hold on.  Hey, we got a surprise for everybody. 
[01:04:00]  A night of surprises.  Thank you, no filter Paul.  Yeah, Paul.  Go up yourself.  Wait, what's that called?  Not so tender sentiments.  Not so tender sentiments.  Not so tender sentiments.  Read one of them.  What does it say?  I can't read from here.  Vagina.  No one can read.  There's no mic.  All right, all right.  We'll get to that in a few minutes.  Your vagina smells like vomit.  Your vagina smells like vomit.  Yeah.  All right.  Three times.  We got a special guest for the Hard Rock Cafe.  A night of surprises. 
[01:04:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, get your cameras together.  It's Tippy Tom.  Oh, no.  The real Tippy Tom.  Not someone dressed as Tippy Tom.  There he is.  Live in person.  Tippy Tom.  Get him.  Oh, yeah.  Tippy Tom, our homeless friend.  That's not Jason.  Tippy Tom is one of the fixtures in New York City.  He's a homeless guy.  Doesn't shower.  His beard is looking like an old cat.  He's also tearless.  And what did he do for Halloween? 
[01:05:00]  Hepatitis?  He's got the mange.  Dude, I think he's been drinking.  And lice.  Yeah, he's been drinking on this Halloween.  Hey, Tippy.  Give Tippy Tom a mic.  Let's eat.  Well, don't give it to him.  Hold it in front of his mouth.  And watch it melt.  Let's see if Tippy Tom has some words for the crowd.  Hi, my name's Tippy Tom.  And when I say, I love you.  I love you.  Let's kill Tom.  Let's kill.  All right, all right, all right.  How about a song? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, we should.  Hey, Tippy, sing a little song, Tippy Tom.  You got carry over?  All right, all right.  All right, all right.  Okay.  Tippy, sing a song.  Oh, no.  Tippy Tom is so drunk.  I know.  Don't want it.  Should I hold him?  Kill him if we say so.  Come on, you guys.  Tell him to kill Tom.  How about a song, Tippy?  A little song.  Okay.  Don't wait for him to be quiet.  Just sing.  Start spreading the news.  And tell these motherfuckers to stop pulling a quarter.  I'm leaving today.  He's going to go in a quarter. 
[01:06:00]  I'm going to be a part of it.  He's going to go.  All right.  Anyone throws anything, they will be thrown out of the place.  That's right.  We can see all of you.  All right.  You're the homeless.  You are not.  You want another song?  Tom, stop.  And I'm just saying that because if you throw stuff at him, he throws feces back.  That's right.  It's like a monkey.  Don't throw things.  It's me.  Okay, wait a minute.  What I want to say is this.  Anybody out there? 
[01:06:30]  Anybody out there want this?  Colin, this is like a wonderful life to you, isn't it?  If you want my body.  Come on, baby.  Let me know.  All right.  Tippy Tom.  Let's hear it for Tippy Tom.  Good job.  All right, Tom.  Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest now when you get right back to wherever you're going,  shower immediately.  You all welcome to Lice.  Wow.  Back to the D train, you cocksucker. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, I see.  Otto and George have made it to the table.  I see that, Anthony.  Very good.  You want to do the first contest, the bobbing for marital AIDS?  Bobbing for marital AIDS contest.  Oh, it takes a while to set up.  Even for Paul R. Nelson security, I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I'm a douche.  All right, we'll do a quick break.

We've got, what, four contestants?  That is correct.  Danny, what's going to happen here?  Well, they all have some marital AIDS in bins.  They have some crap in there that's really gross.  Yeah, they're like big plastic bins, and they're full of water.  And there's marital AIDS in there.  But now, what's the twist here? 
[01:09:00]  There's no twist, really.  It's just to see chicks bobbing and having balling things in their mouth.  Please, please refrain from saying such words.  All right.  So we've got bins of water in front of all the girls, about four or five inches of water.  We've got the marital AIDS in there, and we've got other stuff, too.  We've got cow parts.  Yeah, we have some cream corn, sauerkraut.  One of my favorites is the pieces of cow tongue.  Pieces of cow tongue. 
[01:09:30]  Where is it?  Oh, they're going to live.  Now, what's the object?  Whoever can get all of them out first gets first prize.  All the marital AIDS out?  Get them out of the bin first gets first, and there will be a runner-up as well.  Do I see an eyeball floating in one of those bins?  I hope not.  Ugh.  Is the object, if they're stuck in the water for a long time, if they gave information on Al-Qaeda, 
[01:10:00]  does that matter for waterboarding?  Oh, there's no such thing as...  Water torture.  All right.  Why is there a guy?  I don't know.  There's like three hot chicks and a guy.  Could you lift up your skirt from the back, please?  Oh, these are hot.  Thank you.  Come on, my man.  Wow, wait.  Loser.  Sexy nurse just lifted up the back of her dress.  Why don't we meet the contestants?  All right.  Who do we got, Danny?  What is your name, miss?  Andrea.  And Andrea's dressed very, very sexy.  She's a naughty nurse.  A sexy, naughty nurse.  Naughty, naughty. 
[01:10:30]  And she's got her blindfold on.  Naughty, naughty.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, fellas.  Shut up.  They're showing them.  What are you chanting for, you jackasses?  Jesus.  It's like they show them, and then they chant.  Fellas, sometimes the expectation is part of the erotic stuff.  Yeah, right.  So what do you do, miss?  A little bit of everything.  Yay.  A little bit of everything.  That's always nice to hear.  All right.  Move on to the next gal. 
[01:11:00]  What's your name, missy?  Marco, but the pets know me.  It's Harry Potter, girl.  Yay.  Oh, she was the one we called Harry Potter.  Yay.  Harry Potter with boobs.  Yeah, Harry Potter with boobs.  She's in the...  I can't hear what that means.  Bobby from Marital Aids.  Yes.  She'll be bobbing for Marital Aids.  All right.  Very nice.  And she seems to...  You enjoy the drink, do you?  Yes.  That's hammered.  All right.  And now our only gentleman contestant.  What's your name, sir?  Nick Dick from BobblownAids.com.  Yay. 
[01:11:30]  Yes, of course.  I recognize you.  What's his name?  I can't hear a word you're saying over there.  They're saying hello.  They're saying hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Now, why did you decide to enter this competition?  Because Travis handed me a form, and I didn't know what I was signing up for.  Oh.  You could have backed out, though.  A lot of Marines get in that way, I hear.  Yeah, you could have backed out.  Well, good luck to you.  Thanks, I guess.  I hope you got a good mouth.  It's purdy.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Yay.  Thanks.  Anything you want to say there, sir?  I want to plug the hideout on WTKS.  All right.  Way to use the time valuably.  Yay.  Can we just kick him off?  Get him off the stage.  Get him off the stage.  Wow.  He's being removed.  Feed him to tippy tummy.  Kill your cow.  Get him off the stage.  Kill your cow.  Back a second.  Feed him to tippy tummy.  Great.  Way to take the hotness out of us.  Yeah, right.  There was something that really bothered me about that guy.

Can we get one more broad that wants in?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Get us a broad.  Yay.  I think we're having another hot broad out of the audience here at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Tippy tummy.  Tippy tummy.  We're lifting her on stage.  Oh, get tippy tom.  That'll make it hot.  How come all the girls are blindfolded?  Fezzy, you're not a girl.  Then get off the stage.  Oh, wow.  You want one more there, Fez? 
[01:13:00]  Fezzy wants in.  Fezzy, you think you could maybe excel at this competition?  Yeah, I think I got this down.  This is easy.  This is Saturday night at my house.  I like how you use that term, get it down.  You can get it down.  I understand.  You can get it down.  Easy.  Are those blindfolds effective at all?  They're going to save us.  Anyone without a gag reflex.  Yeah.  Well, I don't want to ruin your spit curl on your head.  I hope that is spit that made the curl on your head.  Well, it's stiff and it's going to be there tomorrow.  All right.  Very good. 
[01:13:30]  It's a nice curl.  Take her now.  Clark Kent.  Yeah, Fez.  We're buying into that.  Hey, let's meet the last two contestants, Danny.  Who did we just drag up?  Miss, what is your name?  Karen.  Yay.  Yay.  Patrice wants to see your boobies.  Where?  Yay.  I like.  I like.  She's blindfolded, just trying to flash, trying to find Patrice.  That is something.  She's got to smell cocoa butter.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  And she is really enthusiastic about this.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  And finally, who's our last contestant?  Just like a devil angel.  Loretta, girl fan, FBA.  FBA, yes.  All right.  OAexperience.com, right?  OAexperience.com?  Yeah.  Either one.  We'll get you there.  We're taking video and we're getting pictures of this mess.  It's going to end up all over the place.  So, if you're not here to see this, you go to places like YouTube or a lot of the other  websites and you'll see pictures and videos.  Hey, Colin, comment.  Yeah, that last one is hot.  She's dressed like the duality of man. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  She's got devil horns, yet she's wearing a halo.  Yeah.  Isn't that all of us?  It was a staring wheel.  Get it?  A contradiction of it all.  I can't get past her bunts.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke.  All right, all right.  All right, enough of your chant.  They're showing them.  I'm going to ask back.  All right, enough with that.  Please, help us out.  We're trying to get some of this on the radio.  All right, now we have to, somebody obviously from the show has to look and see who removes 
[01:15:00]  all the marital aids first.  Okay.  Make sure everyone starts at the same time.  We don't want an advantage.  Right.  We don't want one person to have an advantage.  All right, so what's in the bins again?  We've got the marital aids.  We've got the cow tongues.  We've got cream corn.  What else, Dan?  Shake them up a little.  There's some sauerkraut in there.  Sauerkraut.  Now, do they know how many marital aids are in each bin, or are they just going to be searching  around?  Nice ass.  Okay, that's good.  All right.  And we get the best view, because we're just staring at their ass.  You get the best view. 
[01:15:30]  I've got to look at the girl in the end.  What's wrong with the girl in the end?  Besides everything.  Besides.  Is that her back?  Bob, why are you being so hurtful?  I don't really know where her ass begins.  Leave Bob or Kelly alone.  And her back ends.  It does.  It looks like me in drag.  All right.  Here we go, guys.  On three.  Bobby from Marital Aids.  Sack, sack, sack.  Oh, there's a favorite in the crowd.  One, two, three.  Bob from Marital Aids.  Come on, Fred Schlintz.  Don't get that. 
[01:16:00]  Right out.  A big red one.  Dang.  Oh, my God.  This girl in the end has got more.  Why is she holding her hands?  Oh, my God.  She's got a big black Marital Aids.  Patrice.  Holy Jesus.  Well, we've got a size queen in the contest.  There are more, you dummy.  She dropped it back in the water.  Oh, my God.  Is that girl a moron?  That girl a moron.  She pulled one out, thought she won.  And then when Danny told her there's more in there, she dropped it back in the water.  This girl on the left, the girl in the naughty nurse outfit, is pulling them out like a pro. 
[01:16:30]  She's a machine.  She is like a chick at a frat house.  Oh, my God.  She knows exactly where they are.  She's flinging them around.  She's needed a lot of rides home.  And what a view we have.  She's in that water like William Shatton, his second wife.  She is pulling them out.  The whole part of her body is in the water.  Bill, get in there and get a shot.  What happened?  Did you give up?  Move right in and get a shot.  You only got one.  You have to get all of them.  One more.  One more.  Yes.  All of them. 
[01:17:00]  Look at this face.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  Oh, my God.  The naughty nurse is swimming.  She's in there like Tommy Lee's babysitting her.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  We got a pro in the competition.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Come on.  Get it.  She went from nurse to Lacey Peterson.  She's completely in the water.  She's in the bin.  Wasted.  Oh, my God.  Look at the one on the end.  Looking for plankton.  She doesn't even know there's none left.  She's just going.  She's straining the marital aids through her baleen in her mouth. 
[01:17:30]  That's a whale joke, people.  Come on.  They use it for krill.  Oh, all right.  Wow.  Do we have a winner?  Is there a winner yet?  No, almost.  Almost.  I think the nurse is searching for one last one.  One last one.  She's searching through cow guts and everything else.  She can't find it.  The other one, the girl at the end, the devil angel is pulling some out.  She's got a few.  She's looking for the cow guts.  Oh, no.  Fatty might win the contest.  Wait.  Don't hide your ass.  Move your hands.  Show your hiding. 
[01:18:00]  Come on, Fred Flintstone.  Show me your ass.  We got a winner.  Wow, what an upset.  What an upset.  Devil angel.  Well, can you put it a different way?  This is radio.  I know it was a come from behind victory, but I know certain things don't make the air.  The nurse was in the lead.  She couldn't find that last one.  All right.  All right.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Help us out a little bit today.  I am going to douse you.  You want to be doused with cow guts? 
[01:18:30]  Yay.  The nurse almost had it.  You had one more left, and then devil angel girl pulled it out at the end with a lot  of gusto and a lot of mouth action.  She's completely soaked.  How do you feel?  Photo op.  Good.  You feel what?  Yeah, she's all wet.  You went swimming.  You went into the bin with your entire body.  I know.  I tried to find something possibly fucking good.  You're a little gal, aren't you?  I am a little girl.  And you fit in that bin.  Why couldn't you find the last one?  I don't know.  It's slippery as well.  Yeah, slippery.  They usually are, honey. 
[01:19:00]  You were pulling them out like a pro, though.  I tried my best.  Yeah, you did great.  You don't usually use teeth, right?  It's a lot easier with the fake ones.  With the fake ones, you can't use teeth.  Well, obviously, that's a good strategy.  Yeah, I would like that.  I love her.  And what an upset.  Let's talk to the victory, the victor, victress, whatever you want to call her.  How did the water taste?  She looks like she's used to having things in her mouth.  And we're not talking about marital aids.  How did the water taste?  Oh, disgusting. 
[01:19:30]  All right, good.  Yeah, and now you were behind in the count.  And then all of a sudden, you just came to life.  And I saw marital aids flying out of the bin.  What happened?  What inspired you?  I got a last bit of momentum.  Just had to keep it going.  Yeah?  Let it win.  What were you thinking of when you were putting them in your mouth?  What were you pretending they were?  Yum, yum, yum.  I don't know, Bob.  What do you think of?  He thinks, thank you, Dane.  Thank you, Dane.  Well, what's your name?  What's your name?  Loretta. 
[01:20:00]  Greta?  Loretta.  Loretta.  You guys, let's hear it for Loretta.  She won the following Loretta.  She wins.  What does she win here?  Let's go to the prize list.  She wins $350.  $350.  I thought we were playing Fatty Pig Fatty for a buck.  I'm teasing.  I'm teasing.  You're beautiful.  I know.  And you should have said 50 cents.  Wow, that's really good.  I'm teasing, of course. 
[01:20:30]  You're lovely.  You're lovely, lovely girl.  Those teeth.  Why did you hide your hiney?  You have a lovely hiney.  Oh.  Let me see that.  All right.  She just went up with your points in the book.  You got a nice bone there, honey.  Nice.  You're hiding that.  You can take that home with you, honey.  Yeah.  She wants to take some of the marital aids home with her.  Of course she can.  Take the black one.  You know you want it.  All the big.  Why does it have to be bigger?  I mean, just stop.  But it doesn't work.  Wait.  Wait.  Can you lift up the front while you have nothing underneath? 
[01:21:00]  Oh.  That makes it even better.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Let's see.  I want to see if you take good care of yourself or if it looks like a convict after four days.  Yeah.  You're in between grooming.  All right.  Is that it?  It looks like a woman after.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me give a hand to all the beautiful ladies that participated  in bobbing from our legs.  As well as the winner.  A nice rally.  All right.  Yeah.  You can take those home with you, ladies. 
[01:21:30]  There you go.  You can give them to your friends.  I'll get them.  I'll do clean up.  Can you give that one back to Colin?  Fez has just volunteered to clean up.  Wow.  He's going to.  Fez, you can't take those home with you.  Yeah.  Fez is.  Jesus, Fez.  But Fez is collecting them all up.  He's asking for the black one.  All right.  Fez is hiding them under.  A third-rate joker.  What?  All right.  I didn't leave any for the other kids.  Reminds me of trick-or-treating at my uncle. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  All you need is a little whisker burn to go with those.  Yeah.  Coming up, what's the next contest we're going to do here?  As they clear the stage off.  Oh, that looks disgusting.  The candy-eating contest.  Boy, that looks hard to carry.  It's like carrying a 10-gallon fish tank.  I think you shouldn't dump that out yet.  We may have used one of those.  The suit of the day is New England clam chowder.  You dirty skanks.  Otto, you like that contest?  That was hitty, Cole. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, it was all right.  Do we have the German Shepherd peanut butter contest coming up, or is that for later?  No, no, no, no.  No, you've got to go back.  What's up?  You're ruining everything.  No, no, wait.  Just do it.  Dude, just...  You've got to bring it back the other way there, Craig.  Yeah, go the other way, because we were...  Yeah.  Oh, dude, no, no.  Yay!  Oh, watch your back.  Oh, no, watch your back.  Watch your back.  They're trying to remove the bins of water.  This is hysterical.  Is that going to be the wrong way, dude? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, it's sloshing.  Dude, it's the other one.  That's somebody from the Stray Cats out here.  It's sloshing.  Oh!  They're throwing marital aids at each other.  And cow tongues.  The cleanup crew.  I think that one sprung a leak.  Yeah.  That one looks like the most difficult.  It's North Pole.  He'll be okay.  And Steve Buscemi is taking it out.  Also, someone said it looks like the guy from the Stray Cats as well.  Yeah, they're like, oh, really nice.  Good Charlotte.  Good Charlotte.  This looks like Tom Hanks and fill it up here.  All right. 
[01:23:30]  We're going to...  This crew is professional.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, we'll do the candy-eating contest on the O.P. Anthony show.

First of all, first of all, I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all of the years  that y'all supported me and my partner, Chuck D, for Public Enemy.

And yo, from the bottom of my heart, I just want to thank each and every one of y'all  that watched your man on TV.

[01:48:00]  So I didn't get a chance to see delicious yet.  Oh, but believe me, it's getting ready to go down.  Hey, yo, can I ask y'all a question, though?  Is your man Flavor Flame Pimpin' or what?  No, but for real, y'all, thank y'all for making me number one in the history of VH1.  Also, to let y'all know my reunion, to let y'all know my reunion finale, y'all got like $34.4 million, all that, you know.

Come down here with y'all.  Oh, yo, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot.  Thank you, y'all.  I love y'all, man.  Up here on the panel.  What's up?  The panel.  I call this the panel. 
[01:49:00]  Hey, yo, check this out, y'all.  I just want to say, too, for the first time ever in my life.  You've been in front of this many white people.  Wrong.  Hey, yo, can I tell you something?  Hey, yo, can I tell y'all something?  He's wrong, because I've been in front of Moorwood when I was on tour with you, too.  Y'all need to know that.  But I love you anyway, though.  How about a song, Blake? 
[01:49:30]  Hey, yo, but check this out.  Today, for the first time in my life, I just want to feel proud to say,  I finally, finally released my solo album.  So, y'all, I'm going to be back a little later.  I'm going to be back a little later, you know what I'm saying,  and give y'all a little history, which ain't no mystery.  You know what I'm saying, New York.  But, y'all, New York, what I want y'all to do, yo, check this out. 
[01:50:00]  Before I leave this stage, right, this is what I want y'all to do.  When I put my hands up in the air, right, for one minute,  I want y'all to make this the noisiest minute you've ever had in your life.  I want y'all to make as much noise as you can, as loud as you can,  for as long as you can, for one minute.  Let everybody know that New York is on the motherfucking map.  Let's go! 
[01:50:30]  Come on!  Come on!  Come on, New York!  Come on, y'all, come on!  That's why I love being home, y'all, for real. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, y'all, check this out.  I'll be back, man, you know what I'm saying,  with a couple of my joints from my album, you know what I'm saying,  the whole nine.  Right now, I'm coming down here so I can party with y'all,  get something to eat, get my drink on.  Hug up some of these fine ladies up in here.  Yes, like that. 
[01:51:30]  One more time, y'all, Flavor, Flav!  Rock the house, y'all.  Yeah, there he is, Flavor Flav.  He's coming back to do a song, right?  Yeah.  In a little while, he'll be back on stage doing a song.  Thanks, Flav.  We greatly appreciate it.  All right, where were we?  We're in the middle of the glue trap mummy contest.  We've got these guys on stage.  They're pretty much naked, except for their underpants.  They've got glue traps all over them.  And now the glue traps have been sitting for a little while. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Now might be a good time for you to tell people that glue is no laughing matter.  And a lot of people have been injured by it.  Right.  Here we go.  Yeah, they are hanging on these guys now.  They've been sitting there.  A couple of them still putting more glue traps on themselves.  We only asked for a dozen, and they keep putting glue on themselves.  By the way, Bob just shook Flav's hand in a cool shake, and Bob went, great show, baby.  Really?  Great show.  He was hoping Flav would say you, too.  Nothing. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  How are we going to do this, Stan?  Well, they all have differing amounts at this point.  It should just be first person to get all their traps off.  Yeah, it's going to be first person to get all the traps off.  All right.  If you punished yourself by putting on too many traps, oh well.  All right.  Voss is making sure the traps are on good.  Way to touch them, Rich.  Nice and tight.  These guys are so wasted, man.  Get them on.  They're so wasted.  They have no idea the pain they're going to feel in a minute or two here.  And we're really going to have to look and see who gets them off first,  because I think we might have a close race here. 
[01:53:00]  Don't forget Bosnian war criminal in front.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Let's line up the contestants and get this over with.  The glue trap mummy contest on the Opie and Anthony show.  They're all mummified in their glue traps.  All right, guys.  Get back in position.  All right.  Hold on.  Wow.  This guy put a glue trap on his beard.  You're nuts.  Oh, God.  Damn.  This is going to be a photo op.  I'm telling you right now.  Get your video cameras out.  All right.  Are we ready?  Here's the deal.  The first person to get all their traps off. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  And maybe do a little spin to show everybody that they're clean.  Attaboy, fan.  All right.  Are you guys ready for this or what?  Huh?  All right.  We got the four contestants.  Face the crowd.  Here we go.  On three.  Face the crowd.  One.  Face the crowd.  This guy's hammered.  He doesn't even know where he is.  No, wait, sir.  He's just spinning around like he's an idiot.  Wait.  Bob.  Wait.  What Bob Kelly wants to look like?  Wait.  All right.  Here we go.  On three.  No.  Turn around.  Turn around.  The crowd's got to see this.  All right.  Oh, my God.  On three. 
[01:54:00]  One.  Two.  Three.  Start ripping the glue traps off.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's better.  Oh, the harm.  The Marine's really doing a good job.  The Marine is feeling no pain in it.  The Marine is going to win this, guys, unless you guys start stepping up.  Step it up.  Rip him off.  Rip him off.  Rip him off.  Oh, he's trying to rip it off.  Marine's got some on his back.  Dude, he just took it off.  It's in his hair.  It's in his hair.  It's in his hair.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:30]  They're ripping.  Wow.  He just ripped some skin off.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's on your hand.  It's on your hand.  It's on your hand.  You've got to get him off.  McFoley won.  Yes.  Oh, wait.  Wow.  Oh, you've got one on your hand.  We have a tie.  No.  Oh, damn.  Wah, wah, wah.  Dude, he just edged you out.  The guy with the beard has won the Blue Trap Mummy contest.  Wow.  Man kind did it.  We've got to give it to him.  He got him off first.  Oh, damn. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  Let me explain something.  USA.  USA.  USA.  Let me explain something, sir.  Mr. Marine Corps.  Yeah.  Since you put more on you, that's your fault.  USA.  I understand.  I like how you can take the pain.  But he had one stuck in his beard and his hair, and he was able to rip it out.  Yeah, that was very impressive.  I know.  You had some money on your armpits.  All right.  The guy with the beard. 
[01:55:30]  What's your name again?  Huh?  D.  D.  By the way.  Congratulations.  You won the contest there.  You get $350 thanks to MajorWorld.com.  By the way, Uncle Fester is still trying his best to get the glue traps off.  He's going to wake up tomorrow with one on his helmet.  Anyone lose any skin?  I don't know.  He lost a little skin over there.  There's a lot of rashing and redness.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, that guy's back.  Where?  Which guy?  Right there on his back. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Look at that.  There's an imprint of a trap on this guy's back.  Oh.  They're helping now.  And he put it on his chest.  Oh.  God damn.  You just plastered that one harder on his back, dude.  There you go.  He went to pat him on the back, like, good job, and he just hit the trap.  All right.  Let's hear it for all the contestants in the glue trap.  Mami contest.  Mami contest.  Boom.  That was pretty impressive.  There you go.  I'm scared.  Wow.  That was very scary.  It's the Opian Anthony Show live from the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[01:56:30]  It's our Halloween party.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We'll be back with more of the 2006 Opian Anthony Halloween Show live from the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman tonight on CBS.  Check local listings for Showtime.  Opian Anthony.  Opian Anthony.  It's the Opian Anthony Halloween Show.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared. 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  From the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City.  Tomorrow later it was awful.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Sponsored by Saw 3.  In theaters now.  You turn the lights back on.  Holy shit.  Getting too old for this shit.  They don't even know they're turning off the lights in the green room.  Hey.  Hey.  We're in the pitch dark and no one noticed that they turned the lights off.  This is amazing.  This is amazing.  I'm too old for this shit. 
[01:57:30]  This is sucking every bit of light back.  Oh my god.  I'm exhausted.  Well we weren't supposed to broadcast and do a live show ever again.  We said that every year.  We go.  We're never doing that.  Yeah.  And then every year.  Hey.  Broadcast and live show.  Right.  Let's be stupid.  Right.  Oh my god.  Now we're in a green room.  Half the people are like passed out.  They're leaning against the light switches.  And it's pitch dark and no one notices that we're broadcasting in the dark. 
[01:58:00]  They finally turned the lights back on.  I thought I had a tumor.  Because it slowly started getting dark and I'm like.  Ah.  Tumor.  Tumor.  And then I realized.  No.  It's a drunk against the dimmer switch.  Yeah.  All right.  Oops.  Are we live?  Can we just do this?  I don't know.  I just want to know who took this mic.  Yeah.  And stuck it up their ass.  Check.  Check.  Yo.  Yo.  What's the deal?  This is the Butcher Ed Brock.  The white rapping intern.  Some of you motherfuckers may have heard of me.  The boys are coming back up soon. 
[01:58:30]  We got a candy eating contest coming up next.  Oh, this is a very good deal.  And Flava Flav, as you all know, is in the house.  Flava Flav!  Ladies, whip them out Wednesdays.  Coming up.  Show your boobies.  Thank you.  Okay, don't.  The place people have to do is chase them like.  30 yards, and all of them will have a heart attack.  Really?  They're all fat.  All right.  There's like one black guy in the audience going, what do I feel like? 
[01:59:00]  Hold on.  Save all this for the radio.  I don't even know if we're taping.  Everything is being recorded.  All right.  Well, can they turn down the audience mic so if they start cursing again, we can release  it on the radio?  This is like KGB.  If someone's listening, just turn off the crowd mic.  Oh, my God.  I give up.  I give up.  You know what?  When you give up, Opie, you go over there, and I think those are shots of Jägermeister  that we were supposed to take.  All right.  There you go.  Finally.  It only took a half hour.  Thank you.  We went on the stage.  Are we ready? 
[01:59:30]  We can do this now?  Holy shit.  Someone, Steve?  This is going to be on the director's cut.  A lot of this stuff.  It's going to be Halloween party, 2006 director's cut.  Oh, you know Elo.  Special edition.  Elo is going to throw all this shit right on the channel.  He doesn't give a crap.  He ought to be one of your people.  All right.  Believe me, Voss.  He knows how to squeeze a penny.  The making of a hack.  Let me make.  The making of a hack.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Save all this stuff.  Let me make it official so they know where to start the edit when they have to put this 
[02:00:00]  whole mess together later tonight.  I feel like I'm being made to be professional and then, like, shut up.  I'm losing my mind.  Will you shut up, please?  It goes from pro to yeah, boy, for half hour all the time.  Yeah, what happened?  I got to be reined in.  It's recess for me.  But yeah, boy, depending on.  Shut up.  Give him the entrance.  Shut up.  Give him the entrance line, O.P.  All right.  It's the open answer.  Who?  I'm done.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We have retreated to the green room, Anthony. 
[02:00:30]  Well, we were pushed back.  Yeah.  Yeah, we were pushed back.  I don't know what the hell just happened for the last 20, 30 minutes.  I don't know what made the radio.  I have no idea at this point.  I know we were doing a glue trap mummy thing.  Yeah.  Then all of a sudden, Flavor Flav came out with an entourage that was really freaking  scary.  Well, I thought all hell was going to break loose here at the Hard Rock Cafe, but it worked  out in the end.  Flav had the crowd, man.  He sure did.  Well, he's a hype man.  They dig him.  Yeah.  He knows how to get a crowd. 
[02:01:00]  What is it to say, O?  What?  Is that bad to say he's a hype man?  Did I say something wrong?  You didn't say anything.  I just haven't heard that in so many years.  Rich Voss came up to me and just said the worst, most racist thing when Flav was up  there.  Because Flav was going, A, O, now give me an A, say O. And what did you say?  I told him he knows how to spell.  I told him he knows how to spell.  Hey.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Brave man.  What?  No.  This dressing room is right across the hall.  I'm saying this joke.  Knock on that door.  Oh, yeah.  Well, here's a joke. 
[02:01:30]  No, no, no.  Let's go.  No, no.  I'm not doing nothing.  Now you can't.  Yeah, all right.  Let's go.  Those guys will kill me.  I got to be a side.  Let's go.  Sam, he's taking a long yard punch over there.  Let's go.  This will make for great rain.  Oh, play.  No, no, no.  I'm not brave at all.  All right.  Look at this bitch.  I'm not going to do a joke for the girl.  Look, Voss is looking for a peace offering of Hawaiian punch and cheese doodles.  It's real great when it's in a room full of white men and Patrice.  No, no.  You're right.  Come on.  Let's go.  Bring Flav in here. 
[02:02:00]  Patrice, one of these days, you're not going to have to punch a white guy in the face in  front of all of us.  Leave him alone.  You're just going to have to do it.  Just to prove a point.  Simply that sometimes when Flav was out there, it looked a little bit like the opening scene  in The Last King of Scotland.  No one's seen that movie, but I want to see it, though.  Now I got to see it.  It wasn't bad.  It's getting great reviews.  I got to give it to Colin.  It's a new enough reference that it deserved more than it got in this room.  Wait, can we get Jimmy up to speed here?  Thanks.  Rich, why don't you say what you said a few minutes ago, because Jimmy just walked back 
[02:02:30]  in.  I was outside.  I didn't know.  No, really.  When Flavor Flav was doing his thing with the O's and the R's.  A room of white guys and Patrice.  Hey, that's all you know is how to spell, right?  Yeah, what are you trying to say?  Damn, you just lost every bit of confidence.  Wow, there's no confidence left.  Did you open?  Because Opie was willing to eat more because he was going to knock on the door.  You took the heart completely out of him.  Oh, no.  Yeah, because he's shaking now because he knows I'll go and do it.  You're right.  You were.  Wait.  I wanted to play this for me.  If it was just Flavor, it might be good. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, but he's with four guys that want to play somebody.  Opie broke the horse.  Opie was like that guy in Temple of Doom.  He just reached in and grabbed Voss' heart out.  He watched it pumping.  It was over.  Hold on, hold on.  It's too good because Jimmy's got to share in this laugh.  So Voss was all cocky back here in the safety of our green room and making Flavor Flav jokes  saying that he was only doing oohs and oz because that's all he knows how to spell.  So I go, well, brave man, why don't we go across the hall and say that to Flav. 
[02:03:30]  He's right there across the hall.  But Opie stood up and started walking.  But Norton, he's not putting you up to speed on one thing.  What?  There's 85 mass murders with L.A.  Yeah.  I can't even stop.  Even Trace is scared.  Yes.  Because I might have to prove I can throw a punch.  The two guys.  And I would never say.  The two guys.  And they would beat you the hardest for being with us.  For being the Uncle Tom that's hanging out with you.  I saw two of the guys that machete Trevor Burbick in there.  By the way, stupid me. 
[02:04:00]  I thought I was hanging with a real black guy for the last six years.  I just realized you're not that black.  What?  Because you're not 50 guys.  I'll go sit in there.  Come on, let's have a walk over there.  I'll tell him what I'll say.  No, no, sit down.  Patrice will sit down and all of a sudden he will fit in.  I'm sick and tired.  I'm going to tell him my voice.  I'll just be like, what's up, man?  And we'll be aliens that just landed on a planet we've not seen.  And this is what I would do if I sat in there.  Don't walk in.  What'd you say, dude, in that wizard's costume?  What are you, a grand wizard or something?  Yo, Flay, nigga's a grand wizard up in there. 
[02:04:30]  And a big hand will come over and just smack this stupid pointy hat off my head.  I would not want to see.  If it was just him and another.  There's at least five dudes.  I'm watching them.  Because that's what I'm trying to do.  You're just watching them.  Those guys are highballing everybody.  This one.  Trouble.  This one's trouble.  If I was a cop, I'd say, you got to go.  What?  What?  You racist?  Yes.  You have to leave, sir.  Yes.  You're up to no good.  You beat somebody up just before you got here.  Out you go.  I got to tell you, we got a very cocky crowd.  The Opie and Anthony audience is very cocky. 
[02:05:00]  They were playing along because they were scared S-less.  They were scared S-less.  His whole career was out there.  I disagree.  How many stories do you hear?  Let me tell you something.  How many stories do you hear?  First of all, I'll go right next to you and I'll identify you and he'll kick your ass.  I'll tell you, it's the guy that looks like he's in the second row at a Loverboy concert in 88.  First of all, nothing.  That was pretty good.  That was pretty good.  How many stories do you hear where one of the entourage shoots somebody?  You know, it's just not going to play.  But it's you.  Nobody's going to make the paper.  What's that? 
[02:05:30]  It's you who won't make the paper.  When did you get here?  Oh.  Hey, he's had some great lines.  He certainly has.  Come on.  Some real zingers.  Opie wants a piece of balls on the Loverboy concert.  He's screaming.  He's salivating.  You already snatched his balls.  Don't bore you one out of it, guys.  I know.  I saw a real figure.  I was like this.  He's playing with a smash in the head with a clock.  Even if he smashed his balls, he's looking at me this whole time like this. 
[02:06:00]  He really wants a piece.  He's fuming.  You know what?  Here's the thing.  He's on first album today and I'm the guy.  He's going to get beat up?  No.  What?  It's good radio.  Stop making proclamations.  You hear him?  He sounds like Flav now.  He's like, yo, yeah.  Yeah.  I think Opie's completely right, though.  When he went out to the crowd, the crowd, they would have booed anybody.  They were booing everybody.  And there were people, you suck, you suck, whatever chant, you know, because they just  feel like doing it.  Not a peep for Flav. 
[02:06:30]  Nothing but agitation.  Don't get him going.  It doesn't matter.  Nah.  It doesn't matter if Whitey went out there, no matter who it was.  Jesus Christ could be out there curing people.  You suck.  You suck.  You gotta be white.  There was a fear in that audience.  There was a fear in that audience.  Yeah, there's one sitting right there.  Any other observations?  You think so?  I don't think so.  Any other observations?  How many people did he go out with?  Dude, there were, I don't know, man.  He brought them all out.  They were strategically placed.  I'll tell you what, they didn't yell, they didn't yell, nigga, they answer a quarter. 
[02:07:00]  They didn't throw no quarters.  They didn't yell, nigga, two, nothing.  They went, everybody say ho!  That 80s ho.  Right.  And they all went ho.  You're dumb fans.  The roof is on fire.  No.  We don't need no water.  Don't let it burn.  M-I-F-O.  Any other observations as we're back here?  They really did wave their hands in the air like they just didn't care.  They just didn't care.  They all said ho.  Ho.  All right, what do you guys think of this mess so far? 
[02:07:30]  Exactly.  I think it's a tough edit.  Tough edit.  I'm going to a way to crisis.  Hold on, hold on.  Everyone's talking at the same time.  I thought Colin had the funniest line outside when we were talking.  He said the King of Scotland line, then I heard it.  And then when he started going, hey, ho, hey, Colin said that was Idi Amin's campaign speech.  Damn right.  Hold on.  Yeah.  He had a look.  We want to make sure he wasn't in trouble.  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, it was right across the hall.  Colin, he wouldn't hit you.  You're wearing his outfit. 
[02:08:00]  I'd like to see Colin use his remote control cred to stop that beating he would get.  Let me tell you something like you.  I'll go over there right now and step to it.  Go right over there, bloated.  You'll lose a lot of weight when your jaw's wide shut.  When your jaw's wide shut, folks, what's up?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Any other observations before we get back out there?  I'd like to know why Bob Kelly's so fat he can't even come back here.  He can't leave his seat.  And what happened?  He's just sitting out there.  And where's the great Bill Burr?  Bill didn't show, huh? 
[02:08:30]  Bob is five pounds away from handicap plates.  I can't wait to introduce him one day.  And he rolls out on a little rascal scooter.  It's only his upper torso that's gaining weight.  I'm being concerned, man.  His legs are the exact same as I knew when I first met him 15 years ago.  Thank God all your vital organs are in your ankles.  This guy's screwed.  What I'm saying, he's not able to hold the perfect...  Oh, all that up?  Yes. 
[02:09:00]  He's going to need a block and tackle pulley system just to walk around.  He's a mess.  He's shaped like Peppermint Patty.  From Charlie Brown.  Bobby's built like a lesbian.  I'm not the good kind either.  Hey, Bob, Bob.  He came back.  Why are you calling you fat?  Like, now I come in.  I can't hear you, Bob.  Yeah.  Easy, bro.  Freaking people pleaser I am.  Are they calling me fat? 
[02:09:30]  Where?  Let me go.  Let me go make it better for them.  I'm getting called fat by a 40-year-old guy with a wizard outfit.  That is true.  What is wrong with this picture?  I got a hobbit.  You do look like the gay guy that played Magneto.  I got a hobbit.  I got a golem.  And I got a wizard.  This is Lord of the Rings.  And I got one of the big, fat oak trees.  No, he did.  Oh, no, he did.  Oh, no.  I had nothing but Opie.  You're a good-looking guy, Opie.  I'm looking for somebody who has a Jack Tripper's outfit from one of the old episodes. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, hey.  Can I borrow that?  Yeah, you sure can, Mr. Furley's outfit.  Jesus Christ.  You look like Mrs. Furley.  How's your neck?  Why'd you get greedy?  What are you going to do?  Rich Ross is in the room.  See, the me or him.  That is good when you take half the costume off.  Because now Colin's in an Adidas jogging suit with a grass skirt on.  Actually, that's not a grass skirt.  That's his contract from Comedy Central for Tough Crowd.  Oh, that was a damn good one. 
[02:10:30]  How you doing?  I've been fucking saving that for a while, fatso.  You're the only man that looks like he's wearing an ascot, but he's not.  Damn it, Bobby.  I wish the ONA fans had an ascot.  I don't know why you're supposed to be funny right after that shredding.  You know what you said, Bobby?  You know the ONA fans don't know what ascot is?  They just think he called me a pastry.  Dude, he called him an ascot.  Dude, an ascot.  They're looking for Scott so they can ask him. 
[02:11:00]  You gotta make a spats joke.  All right, we gotta get back out there.  We don't.  Do we have to?  I don't want to do it.  I feel like some of the soldiers that got leave, and then they have to go back.  It's like I made it through one round.  Oh, they're so wasted.  They're so wasted.  What's the note?  What's the note there, Steve?  Chuck D just showed up.  Chuck D just showed up.  Chuck D.  Are they going to do something?  Wow.  Are they going to do a little something-something? 
[02:11:30]  This could be the reunion of the year.  You know what we can do.  Can I see that for sure?  No, Genghis Deluise.  Wow.  I don't like that Quinn went into a room and roast.  He's trying to make a comeback.  He's trying to make a comeback on your damn Halloween show.  Well, I was just going to say, we can get-  Shut it down.  That shut it.  Bobby, stop.  I know.  Just let it go.  We can get that.  He calls you two fat people from different times. 
[02:12:00]  He calls you a 14th century fat man and a 20th century fat man of completely different races.  Oh, my God.  I don't like that.  He called him.  Yeah.  I don't like that fat Keith Sutherland.  He's getting me.  Holy.  I don't like that.  Why don't you shut up while we watch Cannonball Run out there, Steven?  And then we can watch Fatso on 224.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Nice.  How you doing?  Nice talking to you.  Give me the mic back.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Oh, Colin. 
[02:12:30]  Colin Quinn is great training.  It's over.  It's over.  Colin, you should give it up.  Great training.  Colin, you should go home, man.  You're not going to get much better than that tonight.  It's over.  Genghis De La Wies.  Shut it down, Bobby.  It's two different hemispheres on the globe.  Wow.  This is weird, man.  It's like war to gourmet muffins.  I don't know.  Because I-  How are you doing?  You know why?  Because I came in fat.  You two got fat.  You're a mess. 
[02:13:00]  We watched y'all disintegrate.  I've been like this forever.  I walk fine.  Both of you come in waddling.  My knees are used to it.  Did you hear the opening line?  Chuck D's going to go, how low can you go?  Not under 300.  I'm not a steal in the hour of chaos.  All right.  Yeah, we got to do it, huh?  It's therapeutic, I got to tell you.  It was really frustrating on that stage for a while there.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  What are we doing next on the stage there?  Candy eating.  All right.  We're going to do a candy eating contest.  Now, what type of candy?  Is this going to be enough where someone's going to puke?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get back out there.  Five pounds?  Is Pat from the Knocking in this?  Oh, good.  Because he's diabetic.  Let's see if his legs fall off.  This is, uh, we got to go back in.  Back in the field.  That's it.  Back out.  Your R&R's over, ladies.  Come on, Voss.  Let's walk by Flavor Flav's dressing room. 
[02:14:00]  Once more to the beach.  Hey, Flav.  Rich Voss has something to say to you, sir.  Flavor Flav.  Unless he thinks I'm Rich Voss.  Flavor Flav.  He'll just punch the first white person he sees.  All right.  It's the virus.  The opening.  Kick the ass, my friend.  What is it now?  We are heading back onto the stage.  Might as well do this.  Just continue.  Yeah.  Continue.  Right out.  Hey.  Onto the stage.  Joe Beck.  We're on stage, and, uh, there's the crowd.  Some really hot chick is out there just, uh, throwing what? 
[02:14:30]  Yep.  Throwing lays out there.  She's from Germany, Yopi.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Fraulein.  She's, uh, she's beautiful.  All right.  Yeah, the crowd seems to like her.  They're getting ready to.  Because he's got a swastik on his arm.  Nice costume.  Flavor Flav is going to perform in a few minutes here.  So that's going to be very, very cool.  That was a lot of fun backstage.  How are you guys doing?  You all right?  You hanging in there?  Yep.  All right.  All right, all right, all right.  Let's do, uh, let's do the candy-eating contest. 
[02:15:00]  We're going to try that.  Yep.  All right, we're going to try the candy-eating contest, Anthony.  That's better.  How many people are going to watch Jim Norton eat it on Letterman tonight?  Oh.  That means.  Oh, my God, Colin.  They're like, tonight?  What?  But we're at a party tonight.  They just got confused because it's a time travel thing that we're trying to do here. 
[02:15:30]  Yes.  Jim Norton is going to be on Letterman tonight.  Let's hear it.  Yay.  Yeah.  Now we've got to explain to someone in the front row that tonight means tomorrow because  we're broadcasting a bit.  Oh, my God.  Just go with it.  Let's make believe it's Wednesday.  Yeah.  It makes it so much easier for the listener.  All right, we're going to do the candy-eating contest.  Yay.  I want some.  Now, I was a little concerned that there wouldn't be enough candy and it would just seem silly  to have people popping a few pieces of candy corn in their mouth. 
[02:16:00]  But I'm told it is pounds of candy.  Pounds of candy.  And I like that the barrels are here because that only means one thing.  What?  Vomit.  Vomit, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  And there is nothing funnier than seeing someone puke.  It wouldn't be a party without vomit.  Of course.  All right.  We got the contestants or what, Steve?  Where they at?  Oh, my God.  They had 15 minutes to get the contestants.  Why do you think we were backstage? 
[02:16:30]  Bob Kelly?  Pleasuring each other.  All right.  They couldn't get the word out.  I couldn't get the word out.  My leg was caught in a bear trap.  All right.  Let's hear it for Steve.  I had to shoot my own appendage off.  Steve has an announcement as they get the buckets of candy on the stage here.  Steve?  It looks like they went through Bob Kelly's sofa cushions.  If you signed up for the candy contest, please make your way to the right of the stage.  Thank you very much.  Wow.  He's courteous.  That means he hates you. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  You hear that?  You hear that tone in his voice?  That means that I despise everybody.  Thank you very much.  We still haven't gotten a song out of Anthony.  We got the karaoke machine over there.  That's true.  Anytime you want, I'll feel free to go up and sing a little.  While they're setting up, you want me to warble a little tune?  Yeah.  A little something.  Neil Diamond, Anthony.  Neil Diamond.  A little something.  All right.  We're getting ready for the candy eating contest.  Anthony is stepping up to the karaoke machine. 
[02:17:30]  Anthony, a little Neil Diamond.  Is this a good mic for the stage?  Anthony looks terrific in his costume, by the way.  This is a crowd pleaser.  I think everybody knows this one.  All right.  This is an away favorite.  A little more volume.  Thank you.  Singing now, not just talking.  For Christ's sake, I'm a professional.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Check, check, check.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  I want to welcome you all here tonight to the Halloween party.  Everybody knows this one.  Sing along.  Where it began.  I can begin to know it.  But then I know it's going strong.  It was the spring. 
[02:18:30]  Then spring became the summer.  Who would have believed you'd come along?  Oh, oh, oh.  Everybody.  Hands.  Touching hands.  Oh, oh.  Reaching out.  Yes.  Touching me.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Touching you, baby. 
[02:19:00]  Touching you.  Touching you.  Sweet Caroline.  Good time never seemed so good.  Touching you.  Touching you.  Touching you.  Touching you.  Touching you.  I've been inclined.  Touching you.  To believe they never would.  But now I...  Look at the night.  Look at the night.  And it don't seem so lonely. 
[02:19:30]  We fill it up with only two.  And when I hurt.  Oh, when I hurt.  Hurting runs off my shoulder.  How can I hurt when holding you?  Thank you, ladies.  It's warm.  Warm.  Touching warm. 
[02:20:00]  Reaching out.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Everybody.  Sweet Caroline.  Oh, oh, oh.  Good times never seem so good.  I've been inclined to believe they never would. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, no, no.  An eight-bar instrumental break.  How's everybody doing this evening?  Having a good time?  Are we drinking?  Are we having fun?  I say screw work.  Screw work.  Sweet Caroline.  Oh, oh, oh.  Good times never seem so good.  Oh, oh, oh.  So good.  So good.  Sweet Caroline. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  I believe they never would.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Sweet Caroline.  Oh, oh, oh.  Good times never seem so good.  So good.  So good.  So good.  Yeah, I've been inclined.  Thank you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Let's hear it for Anthony.  Never disappoint. 
[02:21:30]  Anthony, everyone.  Oh, it's such a crowd favorite.  All right, we're just about ready for Flavor Flav.  He said he's going to go on stage at 1030, right?  You know, once we edit all the crap out of this, it's going to be a six-minute broadcast.  Six minutes of great radio tomorrow.  All right, guys.  We're getting ready for Flavor Flav, and then we're going to do the costume contest.  We'll be back with more of the 2006 Opie and Anthony Halloween show live from the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman tonight on CBS. 
[02:22:00]  Check local listings for Showtime.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Halloween anniversary party from the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City.  How bad could it be?  You know.  I know you know.  All talk, no action.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Shut up!  Sponsored by Saw 3.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, the O&A virus spreading across America just a few minutes away from Flavor Flav playing live here at the Hard Rock Cafe for our Halloween party. 
[02:22:30]  Now, boss, you were just talking to the people in the front row.  What's going on?  Well, they're going wild.  I'm giving them candy.  And the little guy up front there, what's his name, Neo?  Neo.  Neo wants to get on stage and take his clothes off.  Oh, boy.  Well, it's a good photo op for everybody.  We love photo ops for the fans.  So why don't we get Neo on stage?  Neo, you want to describe Neo to everybody, Anthony? 
[02:23:00]  You know something?  I pride myself on being able to describe things.  I can't.  He, well, he's about five foot tall, tops.  Almost like a midget.  He's got tumors sticking out of his body all over the place, or it looks like tumors.  There he is.  He's taking his shirt off for the crowd.  But this is kind of filler as we wait for Flavor Flavor.  It's some kind of, have we determined what he has? 
[02:23:30]  I don't know.  Why don't we talk to him?  Dan, why don't we get a mic on, Neo?  I see a couple of scars in the back where there might have been some surgeries.  He's dressed as aliens.  Does insurance cover Dr. Frankenstein?  Neo is hammered.  Neo.  Neo, how you doing, bro?  I'm fucking hammered, dude.  Are you hammered?  I love Opie and Anthony.  Fuck everyone out.  Fuck Howard Stern.  Fuck everyone out.  Yeah.  I feel like that, too. 
[02:24:00]  This is awkward for everybody.  Try to not curse as much there, Neo.  Neo, what is the actual term for what you have?  It's M-O-R-Q-U-I-O-U-S.  And what does that mean?  What does that do?  It affects the skeletal fucking syndrome.  Uh-huh.  Listen to it.  I know you fucking niggas don't listen to the shit.  Listen to it.  Fucking, who cares?  Oh, who cares?  It's skeletal.  Fuck the skeletal syndrome. 
[02:24:30]  Stupid skeletons.  Who cares, dude?  Come on.  I hear you.  All right, why don't you address the crowd, Neo?  Neo, do they have that decision?  Listen to it, fucking Opie and Anthony.  Listen to it, fucking Paris.  X-O-X-O-U-S-O-O-5.  Listen to it, X-O.  Yo, listen to everyone.  Fuck this is Opie and Anthony.  He is so hammered.  And you know what?  He has the best body out of most of your audience.  Isn't that odd?  The girls are loving it.  The girls love him.  Yeah, they're calling for him. 
[02:25:00]  Debra!  He's just screaming out girls' names.  Hey, Neo!  Oh, no.  All right.  Oh, no.  Neo's getting naked.  Oh!  All right.  I think we're just about ready for Flavor Flav.  I hope so.  I see a lot of people on the side of the stage that...  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  Well, Neo is completely naked.  Has he tucked?  The Flavor Flav posse is horrified.  Holy shit.  He's got a nice little ass.  Neo, spin around. 
[02:25:30]  Spin around, Neo.  Neo is tucked.  He's pulling a Silence of the Lambs.  Yeah, he got completely naked for the crowd.  Hey, Neo, will you come to Crackers in Indianapolis this week and do that for me when I'm there?  Okay.  Neo, you know what the consolation is?  That when you just did that and saw all those flashes, it won't end up on any website.  Yeah, don't worry about that.  Who gives a shit?  Who gives a shit? 
[02:26:00]  It's fucking Ophianism, you motherfuckers.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  All right.  Let's hear it for Neo!  All right, Neo.  Thanks, bro.  Someone put him back into the little stuffed animal machine that you pull out with a claw.  Oh, he fell down.  Neo, are you that hammered where you fell down?  He's just crawling across the stage right now.  Goddamn, Neo.  He can't be more than 4'10", I'm thinking, right?  Tops. 
[02:26:30]  There's nothing more entertaining than a drunk midget.  All right.  Yes, boss?  I think we're just about ready for Flavor Flav to save this party.  Keith is horrified.  Yeah.  Hi, girls.  How you doing up front there, ladies?  You guys hanging in there?  Check, check.  Check, check.  All right, we got some check-checks going, so, yeah.  Check, check, check.  One, two. 
[02:27:00]  All right, well, uh...  Ah, this is going to be cold.  Yeah, let's see how this develops here, Ant.  Club Soda Kenny, we ready for Flavor Flav.  When's the last time Flav performed live?  Why is Kenny laughing?  Whose idea was it to book him?  Why?  What's the problem?  Ah, they're, you know, they're getting ready.  It takes a while.  Yeah.  It just takes a while to get everything all ready to go.  Yeah, the choir's all lined up.  Yeah.  All right, well, this should be interesting. 
[02:27:30]  It's because they want it to sound good.  You got a problem?  Yeah.  What are you thinking, back in Jersey?  No, I love them.  All right.  They're just check-checking.  All right, they're, uh...  Ah, Jimmy Norton rejoining us.  Thank goodness.  Check, check, check.  Hey.  All right, we're just about ready for Flavor Flav.  Check.  What the fuck is that, New York?

And then they locked me up, and they broke the key.  You see, I had to do my time like everybody else, and I took down that the day off. 
[02:38:00]  So this flame was slain, and the jail locked in.  Give me a pass.  All over the island, that's illegal, who didn't came around to do a crown.  So here we go, just like a kid, I can't keep it moving.  Oh, my God, I'm on the best, but I should ride.  Yes, we can't do this, and we can't do this, and we can't do this.

Sponsored by Saw 3.  And we're back with the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It's our Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Flavor Flav was amazing.  Flavor Flav was amazing.  Wow. 
[02:40:00]  Absolutely amazing.  What was more amazing was the entourage.  Yeah.  There was quite an entourage with Flavor Flav tonight.  A lot of people.  More than we take with us.  We have, like, Club Soda Kenny.  Keith.  That's about it.  All right.  I guess it's time for the costume contest.  Yes.  Let's do this.  So let's get back on stage here.  Let's get on the stage and get this costume contest done. 
[02:40:30]  You guys ready for the costume contest or what, huh?  All right.  We got the finalists on the stage for the Opian Anthony Costume Contest.  What?  They want to go up there.  And, look, they're batting their eyes.  I say you let them.  It's only fair.  At the end.  At the end, we'll do a whole thing with the girls on the stage.  And they'll wow and do what they want with the marital aids. 
[02:41:00]  And that'll end this mess.  All right.  These are the finalists in the costume contest, Anthony.  Yes.  Ooh.  All right.  We're ready.  Here we go.  Our first contestant.  Our first finalist.  State your name and tell us what you are.  Because it's radio.  I mean, the people at home got to understand this.  What the hell are you?  What are you?  Steve the Bear.  Oh, you're Steve the Bear.  He's got, like, a Harley thing on, a flaming shirt, and he's just like a bear, and he's drinking. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Why don't you go to the front of the stage?  What do you guys think of Steve the Bear?  Not too happy with Steve the Bear.  They don't like Steve the Bear at all.  They don't care for him.  All right.  Let's move on.  It's mixed.  We got Robert Reed, a fat version of Robert Reed.  Shouldn't you be?  Robert Reed.  He's got his bowl of broth and his skeleton, and he's looking very, oh, robed with tissues.  See, that would have been a great contest if he weighed, like, 120 pounds, but he weighs about 320 pounds. 
[02:42:00]  He's making a point.  It is Robert Reed.  All right.  Let's see what the crowd thinks.  We do use him on the show a lot.  What do you guys think of the fat Robert Reed?  I think a few liked Robert Reed.  All right.  They're a little, uh...  They're not too happy with the costumes.  And now we have the box of Jimmy's tender sentiments.  They destroyed my black box.  Huh?  They ravaged my black box.  They took all my signs.  Aw, they took all your tender sentiments. 
[02:42:30]  Aw.  All right.  Come on, Danny's brother.  Well, so what is...  Does it say anything anymore?  It's just...  A hundred.  You're now just a paper towel dispenser.  I am something...  That's pretty much what you are.  Not so tender sentiments.  Stinks.  Aw, they're holding up the tender sentiments.  Yeah.  The not so tender sentiments in the crowd.  Golik magic paper cut.  All right.  What do you guys think of him?  Come on.  All right.  Not good.  Not good.  All right.  Moving on with the...  That's so far. 
[02:43:00]  Okay, next.  The costume contest.  All right.  Next we have...  Wow.  I got to tell you, next is No Filter Paul, the bravest man in the house, because he  was in blackface the whole time Flavor Flav was performing.  He was in Flav's entourage.  Yeah.  Dressed like that.  And he's dressed, of course, on Flavor Flav.  What do you guys think of No Filter Paul as Flavor Flav?  Wow.  I don't think they're judging the costume.  I think they're judging the person.  I think they're judging the person.  Get my ass, dickhead. 
[02:43:30]  What do you think?  You guys should suck it.  Yeah, boy.  Yeah, he's not happy.  All right.  I think it looks good, but they just don't like him.  No.  It's, uh...  Wow.  The Destroyer.  A lot of people call me tax.  I believe he's, uh...  He's dressed as me.  He's got a brown shirt on.  The back says, board up.  The front says, the Destroyer.  He's holding some blueberries.  Blueberries.  Blueberries.  He's got his good luck bro bracelet on. 
[02:44:00]  That's right.  That he tells people, uh...  Before they die.  He's got a mousetrap.  A mousetrap for around the house.  You never know.  He's got the awful hair that I have every morning.  He's got the suncloth suits.  Oh, his morning hair.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Wait a minute.  He's got the same shoes on that I used to stomp the homeless guy's cake.  Wow.  This guy went all out.  All right.  Yeah, you gotta give him a little of that.  That's right.  What do you guys think of, uh...  Opie? 
[02:44:30]  Oh, my God.  They really like me.  He did a pretty good job.  Not bad.  God, the same shoes that I used to stomp the cake.  Now, this is very original.  This is very original.  This...  The next costume...  You want to explain it, Anthony?  This costume is...  It's me circa 19...  Wait, Ed.  You better hold on because no one's paying attention to you.  Because, Danny, come on out here.  Our own Danny decided to... 
[02:45:00]  Get to the front of the stage.  Get to the front of the stage.  Danny has...  Has Borat.  Has Borat.  And that awful...  My mustache, it will not stay on.  I need some tape.  Oh, my God.  Danny's got the biggest...  Danny's clipped.  You look like an idiot.  Danny's now arguing with another Borat.  What are you talking about?  Yuck, Shemash!  Yes, I like very much.  Hey, Danny, have an array of...

This makes the costume, and I can't get it to work.  All right, Danny.  Very nice, Danny.  Wow.  In the Borat swimsuit that we've all seen in the commercial.  It's just a horrific sight.  You're going to have to check that one out on opianthony.com later today. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Yeah, here's a girl.  She dressed like me from 1992 in one of my Rock Guts videos.  I thought you were Tony Orlando.  Yeah, that's, uh, you lost the goatee part in the crowd.  That'll happen.  But dressed like me in one of my videos from 1992.  Wow.  That is a very obscure but very well, you see, yeah.  Very nice.  With the Budweiser case.  Very good job.  Dressed as the lead singer, of course, Anthony of Rock Guts.  Yes, of Rock Guts.  From 1992 with the Budweiser and everything. 
[02:46:30]  He got it down.  Good job.  Very nice.  What do you guys think of Anthony from 1992?  1992.  Very nice.  Hang around.  So far it's Opie and Anthony from 1992.  All right.  All right, here's Borat.  What do you guys think of Borat?  The other version of Borat.  What do you think of Danny's Borat?  Look at Danny's brother taking pictures of his cock. 
[02:47:00]  And Danny's mom in the front row.  You know what it is?  They've never seen it soft.  Hey, Danny's mom, what do you think of Danny's cock?  Love it.  It's big.  Oh, wow.  Like his dad.  Yeah, my mom just said she loves Danny's dick.  All right, very good.  What a freaking cluster F this has turned out to be.  All right.  Thank you, Borat.  So, Borat in the suit, yes or no? 
[02:47:30]  No, I think you're out, bro.  I think Danny trumped you.  I'm sorry.  So far it's down to no filter, Paul, Opie, and Anthony from 1992.  George Harrison, Old Puddin' Head.  Huh?  George Harrison, and he has pudding in his head.  He's Old Puddin' Head.  He just has George Harrison.  He's George Harrison, Old Puddin' Head.  And he's got pudding in his head. 
[02:48:00]  That is pretty fucking funny.  I agree.  All right, stick around.  You're good.  You're good.  Stick around.  Stick around.  All right, back up.  You're in the finals there.  Old Puddin' Head.  Who's next in the costume contest?  What's your name?  And for the audience at home, who are you dressed as?  I've been brutally raped and murdered, so apparently I'm Sue's idea of high-team news.  Wow.  Do you have a thong on?  That will help in the voting.  This is deeply disturbing.  That's pretty cool. 
[02:48:30]  She's got blood.  Blood coming out.  Yeah.  How do you describe this?  I don't know.  I like it.  I like it.  She has blood down her thigh.  Well, that's going to help the judges right there.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  A little flashing never hurts.  You want to make some money?  Huh?  Angel fuck for whack bag.  Very good.  Very good.  What do you think, Rachel Burden?  What do you think?

All right.  What do you guys think of Nicole as a wow sticker?  Yes?  No?  That costume stunk.  All right, no.  Sorry, Nicole.  All right, moving on.  Oh, it's... 
[02:49:30]  It is, wow, one of the girls that I went horseback riding with in California, Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver.  And you look better than she did.  Yeah, he's...  Is that you, Wrangler?  Yeah.  People tell me I look like Tatum O'Neal.  Daddy.  And I'll tell you something.  The girl to horse proportion was about right.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  All right, he's on a fake horse.  See, she was fast.  You know, nothing.  One of the famous stories from the opening of the show, Dreamweaver.  Okay, very nice.  I like the Dreamweaver.  All right, who's next?  Good job.  All right, here's the next contestant.  The next finalist in the costume contest.  Hi, I'm Sam.  Oh, he's Sam.  He's half black and half white.  He's got an afro.  And very small thumbs.  No, his thumbs aren't quite big enough, but all right.  And you weigh about 20 Sams. 
[02:50:30]  But that's not saying much.  All right, they're not digging the Sam, but thanks for coming on stage and being in the finals.  No, I don't think they're digging him.  Who's next?  We're just about done here.  Then we've got to pick a winner.  Oh, this is a team effort.  We're from a little movie called Death Wish.  It's a team effort.  They are the...  Oh, well, they're play acting on the stage. 
[02:51:00]  Yes, it's the goddamn rich cunt, I hate rich cunts clip.  Yeah.  From Death Wish.  They're reenacting that on the stage.  What do you guys think?  Yes, no?  I like it.  No.  I kind of like the spirit of it all.  It involves beating her.  All right.  Is this the last finalist right here?  Yeah.  And you are?  This is for Jimmy.  It's Monster Rain.  Monster and rain. 
[02:51:30]  All right, he's a monster and it's raining.  It stinks.  All right, it looks pretty evil.  He's got a cloud over his head.  He dresses a monster.  It does look scary.  You took all the hotness out of the story.  All right, who are the finalists then?  I'd say our finalists would have to be Old Pudding Head.  Old Pudding Head.  Old Pudding Head got a pretty big laugh.  All right, Pudding Head.  Who else is the finalist?  Dream Weaver.  No Filter Paul is Flavor Flav.  Yes.  Old Anthony.  Old Anthony from 1992 as the lead singer of Rot Gut. 
[02:52:00]  The dead murdered girl.  I think they got a nice response.  Huh?  The girl who got murdered.  The girl that got murdered and raped and murdered, we should say.  Yeah, raped and murdered.  That's a bit of a twisted side.  Yeah, I guess Dream Weaver.  And Dream Weaver?  Yeah.  What about the fake Opie?  Didn't make the cut?  All right.  Throw him a bone.  It's up to you.  Well, we've got to get Danny in here.  Well, Danny can't work.  I think he's already changing.
