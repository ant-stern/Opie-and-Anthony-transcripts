<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering off on tangents.  It began with a critique of HBO's *Oz*, focusing heavily on the excessive male nudity deemed gratuitous by the hosts, who engaged in graphic and vulgar descriptions of male genitalia and sexual acts. Callers participated, some agreeing, others disagreeing, with equally explicit commentary.  One caller recounted the *Oz* premiere's plot, involving a fatal bus crash, while another claimed to have seen more nudity in prison.  The discussion extended to other HBO shows like *Queer as Folk* and *HBO Real Sex*, eliciting similar reactions and sexually explicit banter.  The hosts also lamented their low radio ratings, speculating on causes including a prior on-air incident where a pinball machine was smashed (a video clip of which was promoted),  the impact of 9/11, and a possible format change.  A comment by a co-worker, Rick, about male genitalia in *Sex and the City* sparked further sexually charged jokes and speculation about Rick's sexuality. The segment concluded with plans for upcoming shows in other cities and hopeful predictions for improved ratings.

The show then transitioned to a more rambling discussion. Anecdotes about a Madonna-dating hairstylist and humorous comparisons of male and female hair washing were followed by a discussion of the New York Jets' victory and pessimistic predictions for the Patriots.  A significant portion featured prank calls by listener Kid Chris impersonating John Rocker and Bernie Shaw, targeting Ted Turner.  The show then shifted to video games, specifically *Medal of Honor: Allied Assault* and *Grand Theft Auto III*, with a caller, Rihanna, sharing her perspective as a female listener. Another caller recounted life in Salt Lake City and experiences with Mormons.  The conversation further touched upon Boston's politics and corruption, a *Grand Theft Auto III* cheat code, and the aforementioned destroyed pinball machine, leading to promotion of a Jim Norton talking doll and a studio visit from Ron from the Ron and Fez show.  The concluding portion revisited the pinball machine destruction, included listener opinions on various TV shows (*Sex and the City*, *Golden Girls*, *I Love Lucy*), commentary on Joan Rivers and Cindy Adams, and speculation about a fictional "Golden Hanger" award.

A later segment focused on the show's declining ratings and a humorous argument between Opie and Anthony over Opie's possession of rare hockey fight videotapes. Ron from Ron and Fez was a guest during this portion. The hosts dismissed criticism regarding their post-9/11 content and defended their ratings within specific demographics.  The discussion included listener calls, a Royal Rumble trip contest, and further anecdotes about the pinball machine destruction.  Other tangents included discussions of favorite sitcoms, breakfast cereals, and a variety of listener calls.

The final segment began with a discussion about the Dallas Cowboys, followed by crude jokes about Rick's Muhammad Ali project and offensively insensitive commentary about a plane crash.  The conversation turned to the hostsâ€™ and a caller's experiences losing their virginity, involving graphic and offensive details and jokes.  A caller, Jim, described his early sexual encounters in graphic detail, prompting similar stories from the hosts, including explicit accounts of childhood sexual experiences.  The show then proposed a contest to find a virgin to lose their virginity on air, outlining rules and mentioning a gynecologist's presence.  A 17-year-old virgin caller, Carolyn, shared personal details, leading to further crude and sexually charged commentary from the hosts, focused on her weight and body. The segment ended with continued discussion of the virginity contest, promising its continuation the following day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Alright, chill out on that. I'm not that bad.  Bop, bop, bop. Psycho-factor.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027. Anywhere else.  866-277-4WOW.  That phone number once again, 866-277-4WOW.  What's up, Anthony? 
[00:00:30]  It's not, man. Nice to be back after the weekend.  You know, it was the premiere of Oz last night on HBO.  We're going right to that. Okay.  Why not?  Everyone was eagerly awaiting the premiere of the HBO series Oz.  You know, the prison show.  It's a favorite of Ben's.  And I think it's a fine show. 
[00:01:00]  You enjoy the Oz, right?  Aside from, I gotta tell ya, we had joked in the past that the show Oz has too much, and any is too much.  But it's just so...  What?  What?  Kick save and a beauty by Anthony.  I watch the way I talk, unlike some people around here.  Kick save and a beauty that was almost in the net, my friend.  I watch the way I talk.  I was going to give you about this much more time before I was going to pounce. 
[00:01:30]  About much more rope to hang myself with.  Kick save and a beaut.  Anyway, go ahead.  The amount of man-ass and man-junk on that show is completely unnecessary.  I mean, you know, you want to watch a prison show.  I want to see people getting the crap beat out of them.  I want to see the shankings in the weight room.  The fights.  Everything like that.  Great stuff on Oz.  But it's not reality TV without showing what is going on in prison, which is a lot of man-ass and a lot of man-junk.  Keep the fights out of the shower, and that would cure a lot of the problem. 
[00:02:00]  And then last night, the premiere episode, for some goddamn reason,  there was a segment where the black guy in the wheelchair is doing his narrating,  and behind him is the lunchroom.  Every inmate naked.  There's a black guy at his leg up on a chair,  and I don't want to see that.  This is hanging there.  Baby's arm clutching an apple.  Naked. 
[00:02:30]  It was, yeah.  The opening credits, I believe there were nine or ten shots of naked men.  In the opening goddamn credits.  I like the...  It must be a really good show if you're sitting through all this.  Because the violence is great.  The backstabbing and everything, very good.  They don't need...  I don't know why the hell they're doing that.  I guess to get the ladies to watch.  I don't know, because it doesn't seem like a show that ladies would really enjoy. 
[00:03:00]  You're kind of sounding like a chick, though.  This is the women bitch like you do.  What?  When there's too many boobs on the TV.  Well, maybe the broad's got a point.  What do you want me to say?  It was just jam-packed with man-ass, yam-bags, and slong.  Rob, what's going on?  All right, look.  Basically, when they do the little interludes on the guy in the wheelchair,  when he had turned around to kiss the other guy, 
[00:03:30]  that was, first of all, very unnecessary.  Just men kissing each other.  That made no sense.  Not to mention the fact, you know, that they had all the naked guys there, or whatever.  But, you know, basically, when they have the, what do you call it,  when the guy, what's his name, the Saeed guy, the Muslim,  basically when they turn the camera and, you know, his butt is right in the camera.  That doesn't even make sense, man.  Yeah, he was in lockdown, and they were letting him out, 
[00:04:00]  so they bring his clothes in because they have to throw and show  every guy they throw in lockdown completely naked getting thrown against the back wall  and the door's slamming.  And then him getting up and, you know, smashing at the door.  It doesn't matter how the hell, it doesn't matter how many times they do this.  It makes no sense, bro.  There's no point.  There's no reason.  Look, 95% of the viewers have to be men.  He stands up, and there's this black man ass,  right there, taking up half your goddamn screen of your TV.  There's no, uh... 
[00:04:30]  The black anaconda.  There's no reason for it.  There's no reason for the male nudity on that show.  The black anaconda looking for a little meal.  Christ.  All right, thank you, Rob.  All right.  I don't mind the shanking, the goddamn beatings that they throw with the barbells in the weight room.  That's good prison stuff.  Well, Joe's going to bring up a good one here.  Joe, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Every season, Anthony, you quote-unquote complain about the man ass,  but you're still drawn to it.  Quote-unquote.  Quote-unquote. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  This is a deja vu type of rant from Anthony.  You know what?  Because it gets worse every year.  The show must be that good if you're sitting through this.  The show is very good.  It's Anthony's version of Queer as Folk.  No, I can't take...  I sit there, and I'm just like, this is...  There is no need for this.  Well, they show you all those nude men and all the rape and stuff,  and it's wrong because can't you show the positive parts of prison? 
[00:05:30]  The good side.  Yeah.  Aaron, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  When they...  I can't believe that guy survived being cemented into a wall.  Luke Perry.  Did you see what he looked like, though?  Yeah, he's all burnt up.  Oh, my God.  I don't know how they're going to play that one out.  Good news.  Thank you, Aaron.  Later, guys.  Yeah.  I got audio of Anthony watching...  Oh, do you?  Oz last night on HBO.  He's got the most perfect **** I've ever seen.  Long, pink, amazing. 
[00:06:00]  Stickalicious?  Oh, God.  My voice is a little higher at home.  Higher at home, I guess.  Well, the machine was a little fast.  I'm watching.  Maybe that's it.  Was I recording that up in Boston?  I think we recorded that in 78.  Oh, was that?  Yeah, Pete's going to have to fix the machine.  Yeah.  Let's go to Rose.  Rose, what's up?  How great was that ending?  Hold on.  Time out.  You're a guy, Rose?  Yeah.  Rose the guy.  My name's Rosario. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, okay.  My friends call me Rose.  Oh, how much does that suck?  I didn't get used to it.  Yeah, I guess so.  All right, Rose.  What's up?  How great was that ending?  Oh, when I...  Yeah, a busload of all their loved ones are coming to visit them at Oz.  A tractor trailer kind of cut them off because the driver fell asleep and they went off...  Yeah, he perfectly fell asleep.  Yeah, went off an embankment and a bunch of them died.  Did the baby survive?  Yeah, that's all that Schillinger cared about. 
[00:07:00]  Or Schillinger.  I don't know.  He gets mad.  All right, Rose.  Thank you.  Boy.  The Nazi guy.  And then what?  One of the guy's boyfriends are coming back to the prison.  I don't know.  I don't know.  So they're going to be making out in the cell?  You might have to give up on this show.  I might.  You're right.  You are right.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  You got Anthony Anthony on the head before.  That's why girls watch that show.  Yeah.  Because of all the man ass. 
[00:07:30]  That's why my girlfriend watches it.  We got to get the creator of Oz on our show.  I want to see what he's thinking.  Because I'm going to tell you, I don't think the women are tuning in Oz.  You know what?  My girlfriend loves it.  They don't show as much female nudity on any HBO series except for that real sex thing.  But then they're showing everything.  God damn.  You know, you might see a great segment on some strippers at HBO Real Sex.  And then the next scene, you got to see a friggin' get back to nature meeting with a circle of guys out in the woods hugging each other naked. 
[00:08:00]  Coming home, home, home.  That's still my favorite one ever because it was so ridiculous.  Well, we come out here on these retreats to commune with nature and get to know ourselves as men.  And the next scene, they show them in some mud puddle covered with dirt rubbing each other going home, home, home, home.  So what the hell gets you to that point?  Yeah, so they can feel good about their sexuality. 
[00:08:30]  More like men.  Sure, more like men.  Guys all naked, rubbing mud on each other.  Nothing wrong with that.  A few men getting together, talking to nature.  Oh, it's all gooey.  Oh, you know what I think is great on that real sex show, too, when they get the retreats for the couples?  And it's just slob-bizarre.  And there's like maybe one marginally hot chick.  And all the slobby guys want to do some kind of function with her.  And it's like, okay, now she's going to lay down and you all start rubbing parts of her. 
[00:09:00]  And they're giggling and talking like it's a coffee clock.  There's always one hot lady, though.  Yeah.  There's like one hot one.  Yeah.  And then there's the deviant who runs the whole thing.  Some over-the-hill madam-looking old whore.  Right.  So they go, okay, now what we're going to do, see, Janie is going to lay down and I want everyone to put their hands over her and just start rubbing her.  Hold her like a bowling ball. 
[00:09:30]  That's HBO.  But there's no real series, I don't think, that shows as much nude female as the men are being shown on that.  It's ridiculous.  Oz.  Can I touch it?  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You know, Anthony, you sound like a new listener to the O&A show from D.C.  You piss and whine and complain and you rant and rave, but you know what?  Son of a bitch, you'll be watching it next Sunday. 
[00:10:00]  That's right.  Yeah, I don't know why.  You're right.  But that's okay.  That's okay.  We love you anyway, but not in that baby clutching an apple way.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  It's a great prison show.  It's a good show about prison.  You see that goddamn, what's his name, the Hells Angels guy?  Chuck Zito.  Chuck Zito's in there.  It looks like he's getting into some crap next week, huh?  It's just a cool show.  You can't wait to see him naked? 
[00:10:30]  Is that what you're getting at?  That's it.  Where's Chuck Zito's yam bag?  Paul, what's up?  Joe.  Hey.  O&A.  Yeah, I started listening to you guys in prison.  Oh, yeah.  What were you in the joint for, Paul?  Distribution.  Nice.  Ah.  Yeah, I mean, I was in like a minimum security, you know, not like an Oz type of thing, but  I like to watch the show because it helps to remember, you know, so you don't go back.  But I got to say, I turned that on.  I had to turn it off.  I saw more man junk on the show than I saw in prison. 
[00:11:00]  This guy was in prison and he didn't see that much man ass.  That's hilarious.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  Let's go to Caroline, Brian.  Caroline.  What's up?  Hey, how are you?  All right.  Partially because of Anthony, I guess, talking about it so much last year, I tuned in for  the first time to watch Oz last night and I was not disappointed.  And I think that probably is a reason that a lot of women watch it.  You watch it for the nudity?  This is the first time I ever watched it.  Did you see that black guy that stood up in the isolation chair? 
[00:11:30]  He stood up.  I swear to God, I want to see a guy with a white curly wig banging a hammer and saying  sold.  Jesus, come on.  It's coming right for us.  Well, they're not the best looking men.  I'll give you that.  And some of them are quite out of shape.  But, you know, it's nice to have some comparison, you know.  Comparison?  Gee, don't be basing what every guy is packing by those black guys on that show.  Earl, you don't mind that stereotype, do you?  Not at all.  Not at all.  Exactly.  There's these black guys in the lunchroom and they're walking around just flinging back 
[00:12:00]  and forth as they walk.  Dan-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Uh, looks like Zombo.  Hey, what's up, faggot?  What's up, Zombo?  Hey, Anthony, you like movies about gladiators?  You're doing Zombo.  Checkers.  You faggot.  Well, you know something.  Your girlfriend stayed out late watching Oz last night, Zombo.  Yeah, she was, uh, went to her girlfriend's house to watch Sex and the City. 
[00:12:30]  And then, uh, she got home around 12 o'clock.  Yeah.  I was like, I thought it was over at, like, 10 o'clock.  She was like, oh, we watched, uh, Oz.  She goes, uh, yeah, it was a good one.  You know, the last thing I want to say is some aging, effed-out bitches on that goddamn Sex and the City.  You know, it ain't cute.  Listen, I'm talking about how, how, that, that schlong line that that one bitch was saying.  Samantha?  Lassie.  Was it Samantha? 
[00:13:00]  Lassie from friggin' Porky's.  That's all I know her from.  Donna, what's going on?  I totally love Oz.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  The men are so dirty.  You like dirty?  Yeah, throw you in that cell block.  Let's see how quickly you'd like, uh, how dirty they are.  They're just real.  Goddamn.  You'd be full up.  Well, of course the lady's gonna enjoy that, right?  You'd be full up.  Look like you'd be vomiting tapioca.  Karen, what's up?  Karen.  Hey. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, you're, you're up on the, uh, show here.  What's up?  Yeah, I don't really watch Oz, but I have to say it's about time I hear a guy complaining about this.  About, what, male nudity?  Oh, yeah, no, yeah.  Most guys will complain about male nudity.  What's that?  Unless you're Rick.  Just complains about how short it's on the screen.  Yeah, we'll get, we'll get into that in a second.  No way!  Thank you, Karen.  No problem.  I just gotta go to Patrick in Buffalo.  He has a comment.  Patrick, what's up?  Hey, uh, uh, just wanna let you guys know, uh, the high school I go to, uh, Tom Fontana's 
[00:14:00]  an alumni.  Yeah.  He's, uh, he's the right of Oz.  He's a little, um, light in the loafers, if you know what I'm talking about there, hey.  Well, you're saying rumor is, uh, he's a little gay.  Oh, it's not a rumor.  It's a well-known fact around here.  All right.  All right, then?  How's the snow?  Uh, the snow, it's very deep.  We just got back to school, unfortunately.  Uh, we're, we're sitting at about seven feet, you know.  It's, it's fun to play with.  A little, you know, white stuff all over the place.  Well, at least you can watch the Bills in the, uh, oh, I'm sorry.  No, we can't watch the Bills. 
[00:14:30]  All right, Patrick, thank you.  Take it easy, boy.  Bye.  And I'm not proud of my Jets today, I'll tell you right off the bat.  I'm embarrassed that, uh, Vinny Testaverity.  Vinny.  Last drive of the season.  Yeah.  And, and all he could do is get us a, a 53, uh, yard football, uh, field goal with Hall.  And Stinky's jumping up and down, like, you know, we have a chance in the playoffs this year.  It's all new in the playoffs.  That was embarrassing.  That was the best he could do.  Final drive of the season. 
[00:15:00]  Of the regular season.  Ah.  Ah, let's go to Rich real fast.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Bowen A?  Hey.  Norton, uh, you're the funniest cancer victim I know.  Oh, thank you, sir.  That's a victim.  Um, I just want to give a, uh, big F you to, uh, 94WISB for playing those queers folk ads all the time.  God damn, I can't stand it.  Well, pretty much every station is playing those.  But every single commercial break they're playing it, I'm a man, no.  See, if anyone liked, uh, watching man-ass or man-junk, they would just watch that show. 
[00:15:30]  I think everything on HBO sucks.  If you watch it, see, Oz is the prison show that is a good show, but unfortunately it's, it's got too much man-ass in it.  I think everything on HBO just sucks.  Does queers folk, uh, show the man-ass in?  Couldn't tell you.  Maybe someone can help us out with that.  I have no clue.  I know one, I'll tell you one thing, I'll be honest, as I'm going through the channels,  uh, there's a big friggin' sex orgy scene going on, so you stop.  And I'm looking, I realize there's no chicks in it. 
[00:16:00]  Oh my God.  It's queer as folk, sucking and effing and plowing fists and hands and junk and, like, oh my God.  You got bombarded with a lot of gayness this weekend.  My TV got aged.  I had to bring it back.  I'm going to get a new one.  Hey guys.  Hey guys.  The TV guy said, I've never seen this before.  Your TV has the him.  The ninja.  I don't know how it is.  The bug.  All right.  Hey guys.  Go ahead, Rhett.  I want to say, uh, I think that little, uh, pinball breaking bit was, uh, pretty fake last Friday. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, well.  Fake?  Yeah.  It's not like you guys are just breaking panes of glass.  Wait.  I guess you haven't been to the website.  Go to foundrymusic.com and you tell me that was fake.  Uh.  There's a, what, about a 20 second video clip of me smashing the pinball machine.  Really?  If you think it's fake.  Really smashed, man.  You can go to opiananthony.com to get to foundrymusic.com.  We've been watching it a lot because it's, uh, the sound is great, first of all, when  the first hammer blow hits.  And then just looking at Al Dick's face. 
[00:17:00]  It just sounded pretty fake, I guess, if it's on the, on the, on the website.  You know what?  If we were faking it, we would have made it sound more real.  Let me tell you something.  What can I tell you?  Let me, uh, let you in on a little radio secret.  If that was a fake radio bit, we would have made sure we smashed that pinball machine at  520, everyone.  Oh!  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Because that's when you have the most cume in afternoon drive.  We didn't smash that thing until, what, 650 because we were waiting for, uh, for, uh,  Ronnie's approval.  Why don't you just smash something every day at 630?  No, because, yeah, at 630, smash it. 
[00:17:30]  Smashing at 630?  Bleh.  Yeah, go to foundrymusic.com.  There's a clip up that everyone's checking out today.  It's, uh, it's pretty, pretty good.  All right.  Eagles rule!  Okay.  Go Phillies!  Okay.  All right.  I got to root for the Jets first, so.  No.  And then who do I root for?  Do we go with the Eagles or the Patriots?  Any testicles?  Ooh.  You know something?  Eagles.  Yeah, baby.  I'm sorry.  Eagles or the Patriots?  No way. 
[00:18:00]  I couldn't...  F the Pats, man.  Come on.  Enough.  Don't even fake it.  Stop already.  Come on!  Just stop.  No, I know Ben.  Please, Ben.  I'm a diehard friggin' Pats fan.  I got to go against you here.  I would go with the Patriots.  Really?  Brady brought that team back.  You got to respect that.  I don't know.  I have a hard time supporting your teams up there in Boston, my friends.  Super Bowl!  I'm really sorry.  The dirty Eagles?  How can you support the dirty, awful Eagles? 
[00:18:30]  It has nothing to do with the Eagles.  It has to do with the Pats completely.  It's like the Mets fans not rooting for the Yankees.  It's like I can't...  I cannot bring myself...  Hey, are they going to bring out some...  Boston, I'm with you.  I'm with you.  Some bar goers and have the line jump on the...  Let it be known that Opie's with you, Pat fans.  Hey, are some of the Pats going to go moshing?  So they can go and give women concussions in the VARs?  That is an entertaining goddamn team.  You know, the goddamn Pats, it's amazing.  They're just like Dallas as far as getting in trouble. 
[00:19:00]  But it's so corrupt up there in Boston, everyone gets off the hook.  That's pretty much what it is.  And, oh yeah, they're white.  Pretty much it.  Max Lane, yeah, and Bledsoe.  Yeah, we're drunk.  Let's mosh.  Let's stage dive.  Huge mother effer stage diving at a club.  They land on a chick.  That was fantastic.  Everclear.  Yeah, right, the Everclear show.  Where are those guys?  That's right.  All right, we're just getting started. 
[00:19:30]  So there's an interesting video clip of the pinball machine thing on foundrymusic.com.  I think we're going to play the smashing later on in the show.  All right?  And I think when we get back, we've got to talk about what Rick casually said in the office.  Yeah, about a Sex and the City episode.  He gave us at least 40 minutes of radio today.  Thank you, Rick.  Because we were all stressing about the ratings, so we didn't have time to focus on the stupid show today.  Can you find the barrel, or would you like us to show you where it is?  Just step right in. 
[00:20:00]  And are we going to be playing What the Hell is Muhammad Ali Saying today?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  We've got prizes to give away for this game?  Oh, my God.  We don't have prizes?  Uh-oh.  Nothing?  No prizes.  Not really.  Do we have anything?  Tickets.  Tickets to what, Earl?  Seven dollars.  Oh, we do?  Isn't there somebody we can go to for a prize?  Anyone?  Is there somebody out in the hallway?  We do have a marketing director from Texas.  Some of the new stuff on the walls.  Yeah, some of the new stuff.  Earl, did you hang those pictures? 
[00:20:30]  I had nothing to do.  Obviously.  Apparently.  You're still going to be at it.  They're off.  That's why I was asking.  We're getting a little paranoid around here because there's a lot of rock posters on the wall.  Yeah, there's like rock band posters.  Like if you walk into a rock station, you'll see beautiful framed pictures of various artists that that station might play.  Ben, who do we have on the wall?  We have a U2 Joshua Tree poster.  We have an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer thing from God knows when for N.E.W.  I'm surprised Roger didn't get that when. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, there's two things that survived Roger.  The Joshua Tree and that ELP thing survived.  I saw a Juris Priest poster.  Judas Priest signed.  There's a Creed poster.  Is that management saying, look, you guys better get your effing asses in gear?  That's almost like a veiled threat.  All I'm saying is ratings for this radio station came out today for New York City.  Bleh.  Holy yes.  Bleh.  Holy yes.  Awful.  Oh, horrid.  Awful.  Horrid. 
[00:21:30]  Absolutely awful.  Wish we had wins numbers.  So the ratings come out today, and coincidentally, there's posters all over the wall for like...  Yeah, for rock bands.  Rock bands.  Pearl Jams Up.  What else is up?  Stone Temple Pilots.  Format change in the future for N.E.W.?  Hmm?  Who knows?  Hmm.  The Rock of New York.  Back to the Rock of New York.  Classic rock.  Classic jocks.  Ratings were not kind for this station in New York City today. 
[00:22:00]  Awful.  Absolutely awful.  We're so close to...  This station is so close to being in the fractions.  Not even a whole number.  We're at what?  Overall, as a station, a 1.3?  Yeah, I think the lowest ever.  It's been the lowest ever?  This could be the lowest ever.  Yeah.  Oof.  In the history of this radio station.  Wow.  And that's with our monster numbers in afternoons.  Well, that's dragging us down.  Well, and even that took a hit. 
[00:22:30]  Ouch.  You know, they always said, you've got to row the rowboat away from the sinking ship,  or you get pulled down in the whirlpool.  I think there's a whirlpool happening.  I don't know what the hell is happening.  And we're paddling as fast as we can to get out of the current, but it's...  It's sucking us in.  Row!  Row!  We're trying.  We're trying everything.  All right, we'll take a break and wait till you hear what Rick said.  Ah, Rick, again.  Are you bastards ready to rock? 
[00:23:00]  Opie and Anthony.  And you'll actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Psychotic apes.  Is this for shock factor?  Oh, my God.  And the double game.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stop!  Chronic from Jersey writes, we were talking about Oz before the break.  Yes.  The one positive from all the mail-makingists is that now I know my junk is bigger than Luke Perry's. 
[00:23:30]  Is he sporting a little Twiggy thing there?  Well, they showed his junk last season.  And I got nailed for that one, too, at home.  And I'm watching it, and I'm playing a computer game during it, and my girlfriend goes, oh, look, Luke Perry's junk.  So I turn around and look, and she goes, faggot. 
[00:24:00]  And you got nailed, you said.  Yeah.  I go, you know, you turn around and look.  I look.  Does he have a grower or a shower?  I don't know if he's got a grower.  How the hell would I know that?  I know it was, uh, I don't think he should be parading it around.  Are you breathing?  You know.  Oh!  Are you breathing?  No, no!  Well, a lot of people ask it about the ratings, Anthony.  Are you breathing? 
[00:24:30]  We were just less gooder this time around.  How's that?  Less gooder.  Well, you know, I love how management always can put that positive spin on it.  You guys, you're still number one in all the men.  I'm like, oh.  I can't breathe in.  What does that mean?  Which we are.  Means Norton's chased away all the women?  That's what we told Norton so as he arrived.  Is that what it is?  Because I think I could live with that.  And then the pathetic soul over there suggests that we get more female guests on the show.  Maybe the women want to hear, uh, you know, female guests. 
[00:25:00]  You know, like, uh, Judy Gold.  Yeah, but I suggest...  Judy Gold is funny.  We'd probably have her on the show no matter what.  That's what I said.  People like guys would like, too.  I didn't say bring a breast cancer expert on and talk about that for four hours.  I mean, granted, it's sexy.  But, I mean, who wants to hear about it?  Can we start using words like cutie patootie?  That'll seem to get the, uh, females in.  Oh, blah, blah, blah.  Maybe everyone could name a star after their gal.  Yeah!  Something like that.  Sure.  I'd rather name a hemorrhoid.  Oh, what's that star?  It's a groin.  Smells like a horse stable. 
[00:25:30]  Ah.  So, here it is.  Uh, we're less gooder.  We're less gooder in New York.  Yeah.  Uh, we're still number one with all the male demos.  Thank you, men.  Thank you, men.  Thank you, men.  Thank you.  Thank you, men.  And, um, and, uh...  Yeah, that seems to be all they care about in there.  Meanwhile, we're like, eh, no.  We kind of want to win at the beauty contest number.  I'm kind of embarrassed because, um, Sean Hannity beat us this time around.  He's never done that before.  Never, never, never, never, never.  Never was close. 
[00:26:00]  He does a lot of that, um, talk that is very relevant to, uh, certain events that have  happened over the past couple of months.  What, the September 11th thing?  Yeah.  I thought we did a good job talking about the, uh, the important issues.  Oh, stop it.  Who the hell was listening to this goddamn show for the entire month of September, first  of all?  It, uh, you know, I think, uh, certain news events dictate what happens sometimes.  And you gotta deal with it.  You just gotta live with it.  Yeah, news, uh, all news. 
[00:26:30]  All the news stages went through the roof.  All news kicked our asses in Afternoon Drive.  Kicked our asses.  Sean Hannity beat us.  Uh, I have to point out that, uh, even though we were less gooder, Mike and the Mad Dog, even  lesser gooder.  Lesser gooder, Mikey.  I don't know what happened.  I was hoping that if people were gonna tune in to Sports Talk to hear about the World's  Five Funnel.  Before Ant and I came to town, they, uh, pretty much ruled Afternoon Radio.  Yeah.  And even though we did less gooder, they are just plain awful. 
[00:27:00]  They did more or less gooder?  Oh, the lessest gooder.  Oh.  They're awful.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And I love pointing that out every three months.  Awful.  Not even close.  I like Mad Dog, though.  And the little Abercrombie and, uh, and, and Fitch Midgett over there who thought, hey,  I'll put a wacky guy with the cool rock guy and, and they'll compete with Opie and Anthony.  Eh!  You'll lose too, douche. 
[00:27:30]  I never understood that move.  Brilliant idiot.  Tell you the God's honest truth.  Over there at, uh...  Ann and I, we live the rock and roll style.  Let's look at this logically.  Ann and I live the rock and roll lifestyle, but we just don't play the music.  So how do you compete with Opie and Anthony?  We, we, we do play the music over here.  I know, we'll get some wacky, crazy guy to join with the knowledgeable rock guy,  and they'll beat Opie and Anthony.  Failed miserably, you idiot. 
[00:28:00]  I never understood that move.  Over there at K-Rock here in New York.  Kane's a very capable guy.  The guy's a good rock jock.  You know, he's informed.  Got a good delivery.  He's got a good delivery.  He's informative, like you said.  Yeah, he's very good, I think.  So let's see, let's play less records and have more babble from these two  that actually hate each other when they're not on the air.  Yeah, that's smart.  We were the other guy with him, and it was like, it's like a monkey wrench.  It doesn't compliment what he does. 
[00:28:30]  It, like, throws a wrench in it.  I'm just being honest.  I'm not even talking about, oh, this guy's a dick, or this guy's a dick.  I'm just saying it doesn't sound natural and stuff,  and you should just let Kane do what he does best.  It's horrible, really.  It is.  Horrible.  Oh, well.  A few other things, the station that we're on in New York,  pretty much falling apart around us.  But Scott Farrell just joined the morning show, the sports guys, 
[00:29:00]  and I think he's doing a great, great job, Anthony.  There you go.  So we'll have to wait and see.  This book doesn't reflect, this ratings period doesn't reflect that we brought Scott Farrell aboard.  So, and our buddies, Ronnie and Fezzy there, they had a little bump up in night.  So, doing very well.  A couple positive signs.  The rest of the station's like...  Dive, dive, dive, dive.  We've already hit the bottom, sir.  Oh, damn. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Well, nothing worse could happen.  Depth charges.  Depth charges.  Depth charges.  Damn it.  You want a little taste of reality?  The rivets are popping.  You want a little taste of reality, Anthony?  When you and I came to this station in New York three and a half years ago now...  Has it been that long?  Three and a half years ago?  Yeah.  The station was pulling in a, I think it was a 1.7.  A 1.7.  And that's with no ratings in Afternoon Drive.  None.  Right.  None, none.  Remember, it was Scott Muni doing his show with One Lung at the time, remember? 
[00:30:00]  Yep.  The station three and a half years later, we were supposed to come here and revitalize the station  and bring it up to, you know, respectability in the market.  Today we sit at a 1.3.  And that's with our ratings that are much higher than what they had in Afternoons before we got here.  This isn't like golf, right?  Where it's better, the lower.  Okay, I'm just making sure.  There are stations that beat other shows on this station that don't even come in in New York City. 
[00:30:30]  I don't understand how that works.  This might prove that there might be a flaw in the rating system.  So, how could a station beat you in a day part when it doesn't even come in in Manhattan?  I don't get it.  So, there you have it.  That's the reality.  We're still number one in Man, but we're less gooder.  Less gooder.  Less gooder this time around.  Hoping to be more gooder.  And all the big bosses around here saying, 
[00:31:00]  Oh, it's that whole 9-11 thing.  Don't worry.  You guys are doing the right thing.  There's a buzz about your show.  Blah, blah, blah.  So, keep the course.  Stay the course, right?  Stay the course.  Oh, well.  All right.  All we can do is what we do.  That's it.  There's no change in what we do here.  That's it.  All right.  Paul, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you doing, guys?  Hey.  I'm one of the four people who are listening every day. 
[00:31:30]  I just want you to know that, first of all.  No, we got a lot of people.  No, we'll close my mind, though.  We'll close.  You know what?  I've been listening to you guys, Opie, you guys, since Long Island and then back in New York  since you have, like, the first day back here at A&W.  I've never seen an ad.  I mean, how does your station expect to get people to listen if they don't ever advertise?  We never needed ads.  No, but you know what?  There's a lot of media out there.  Maybe people don't know you're out there.  But it's just amazing.  Never advertised.  Paul?  Yeah?  They put up a Opie and Anthony wow billboard in the middle of Times Square. 
[00:32:00]  I hear you.  But like you pointed out at the time, that's Taurusville.  That's not necessarily where the New York is.  But it was also in the subways and on all the trade platforms.  I don't know.  Your station's got a lot more in office than just you guys.  Hold on.  We're doing just fine.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  But they should publicize the rest of their stuff.  They don't.  We need a couple shows around here that are going to be around for a while.  You know, there's a list of well over 50 people that have come and go.  I hear you.  Are you coming on since we started here?  I used to listen to Ron and Fez every day, but since they got moved to Knights, I can't 
[00:32:30]  listen to them just because it's a bad time.  Ron and Fez have had...  We'll see.  And they're doing well.  Yeah.  Ron and Fez have had five time slots since Ant and I started here.  Yeah.  And there's only four time slots during the day.  You figure that out.  Well, keep doing what you're doing, guys.  You're doing a great job.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  That's it.  I'm going to hold out and think that we're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to keep your chin up and turn this thing around.  Christy, what's going on?  Where's that your toolbar? 
[00:33:00]  You need to hit the toolbar?  The toolbar.  Hey, Christy.  Hey, I just want to say I'm a chick and I support you.  Oh, cool.  Hey, there you go.  Thank you.  It took a long time for me to get to like you, but...  Yeah.  Well, what was the problem at first?  Um, I don't know.  You guys are too...  I don't know.  Opie, you know what we're like?  We're like those wacky little movies from the 80s where the annoying guy likes the girl  and she didn't like the guy, but then by the end, they're in love.  It just takes a little longer than you would have liked. 
[00:33:30]  And I listened in September, too.  We're ducky.  Are you talking about the plot of Valley Girl?  We're talking about the plot of every goddamn movie from back then.  Ah, Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman, fine film.  Wherever you get the nerdy, geeky, either a guy or sometimes even a girl wants the jock  guy or something, it just doesn't pan out.  And then by the end of the movie, the guy realizes, hey, maybe we're a little too abrasive.  You think so?  Well, we ain't changing a thing.  Okay, see you later. 
[00:34:00]  Bye, Kirstie.  Bye-bye.  All right.  I think we're more like, um, the Breakfast Club.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Where, uh...  Yeah, yeah, where you got the, uh, the wild guy there.  What with the hell?  The drug addict guy.  Judd Nelson.  Judd Nelson.  Was that Judd Nelson?  Well, no.  Uh, whatever, yeah.  And, um, the red-headed bitch.  Molly Ringwald.  Molly Ringwald.  See, by the end, oh, at first she couldn't stand him.  Right?  You with me on this?  No, huh?  Well, I'm just thinking of Emilio Estevez and that really hot story about tearing the 
[00:34:30]  tape off the man's ass.  A better example would have been Sixteen Candles with Molly Ringwald.  Um...  Or the Pretty in Pink, you know, the girl from the other side of the track.  All right, okay.  Uh, Doug from Springfield, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I'm sure you're going to get some new listeners now that Anthony's favorite TV show is ours,  you pickle boy.  Let me ask you one question.  Yeah.  You turn the channel on your TV.  Yeah.  You see a bunch of naked guys.  You keep the channel there, you turn it. 
[00:35:00]  All I know is I turn it.  I don't watch it.  It just, it's that Oz is a good show.  Oh, that's right.  Your battery drain out in your remote, that's why, right?  No, the storyline is great.  Oh, yeah.  Like, if you guys, your friends came over your house and they saw you watching that,  what would they say?  Hold on, Doug.  Let me ask you something.  You must be really homophobic.  No, dude.  Look at my profession.  I'm not homophobic.  All right.  You're a homo.  Oh, yeah.  It's funny.  That's a good one.  I have never seen Oz for whatever reason, okay?  But Ant really enjoys the concept of a prison show, Oz, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:35:30]  He just has a problem that they have to get as real as possible and show all this man ass.  Oh, okay.  It's not like he's, you know, watching queer as folk.  Doug, you're a hairdresser, right?  Yes, sir.  All right.  And what?  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks, Doug.  That's all.  And what?  That's all.  And what?  Nothing.  Nothing what?  Fine.  Handdresser.  I got...  So, what does that mean?  I watch...  Are you getting like Opie now?  I watch a TV show.  You're a hairdresser.  Doug, I'm defending you.  That's all I'm saying.  No, I'm not saying that. 
[00:36:00]  Opie called me a faggot once.  I'm defending you.  And where's my hockey fight, Dave?  I'm bringing him in today.  All right.  Actually, I'm running him right now.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  See you, Anthony.  See you, Anthony.  Home-o.  Later, guys.  I don't know if being a hairdresser, man, to know if the school for interior decorating  is all full up.  It's a great living, I guess.  Dave, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Dave?  I think Norton's a model human being.  Thank you, sir.  I think he's holding back too much.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah?  He doesn't really have much. 
[00:36:30]  I think he brings up your ratings.  Dave, let me tell you something.  He doesn't have much in that brain.  We ask him every day.  What do you got for the show today?  I got my coffee and I got water.  He's the best.  Caffeine and a sex addiction.  He's the best.  Yeah, obviously.  Let's see what has changed in the last three months.  Ratings have gone down.  What has changed?  Bringing Norton aboard?  No.  How do they figure out these things anyway? 
[00:37:00]  Who cares, Dave?  We're fine.  Huh?  I think you.  I think you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Okay.  Can we get...  Can we talk about what Rick said in the back office?  Yeah.  And I think Rick is hiding because he knows he put his foot in his mouth this time around.  He's screwed up.  It happens.  We're talking about Oz and how this just man junk and ass on a show that there doesn't  need to be.  Believe me.  So then Sex and the City got brought up. 
[00:37:30]  And Rick was talking about how I guess Samantha is describing the sea that she loves to take.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You were talking about all that.  And then Ben brought up, oh yeah, they showed a guy sack.  Yeah, don't let him, don't let him, don't let him say this because I want to say what  was said.  Well, that's how it happened.  Ben brought it up.  I'm like...  That's, I was getting to that point, Rick.  All right.  It's okay.  All right.  Listen to how defensive Rick is.  Take a breath.  No, because you're going to make me gay again and I don't want to be gay today.  I'm not making you gay. 
[00:38:00]  I just had to spend 20 minutes, 40 minutes almost talking about man ass and man junk on  Oz and take that abuse from the callers.  I know the truth and it doesn't bother me.  I'm gay.  Can we just repeat what you said?  How about we just repeat what Rick said and we'll go to the phones and see what the fine  listeners say.  Is that fair, Rick?  As long as you get it right.  We got it right.  No, no, no.  There was a lot of...  Here's what was said. 
[00:38:30]  Somebody mentioned that on Sex and the City, they showed a man's yam bag and Rick said,  yeah, but it was too quick.  No, I didn't.  See, I didn't say it like that.  I said, yeah, but it was quick though.  There was no though.  Yes, there was.  You know what?  I'm going to start recording the office conversation.  You should.  We need a black box back there for just such a disaster. 
[00:39:00]  There was three guys in the office at the time.  Ed, myself, and Ben.  We never heard though.  So what was it?  Too quick for you to catch a good glimpse?  Too quick for you to put the image in your head?  Not enough time to get your nose against the TV?  That fresh onion-y smell?  He's been cutting lawn.  When it comes to seeing man's sea on a TV screen or in a movie theater, time should never be part of the equation. 
[00:39:30]  We were comparing because he was talking about...  Unfortunately, the time stands still when you're in that situation.  Right.  Anthony's complaining about all the man-ass and junk that he's seeing.  And I said, well, at least it was quick though on the text.  No, you didn't.  Now there's at least...  There's at least...  You never said at least.  I never said at least, but...  You never said though.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  What is that?  Because there wasn't as much...  I didn't have to suffer through as much as you basically said, but it was quick. 
[00:40:00]  Look at Uncle John's.  That's on three.  Let me go to Uncle John.  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Let me get this straight, Rick.  You like the slow-motion panoramic shots of the airbag?  That's a big, slow...  Artistic view?  Pan.  Oh, okay, boogie.  A little zoom in on it.  Oh, Rick.  You scare me, Rick.  I'm starting to worry about you.  Thank you.  Time stands still in that situation.  Yeah, because you guys just hear one little thing,  and then you start laughing and twisting it and... 
[00:40:30]  If three guys are laughing uncontrollably,  then at that point you realize,  oh, man, I put my foot in the mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Then you just, you know, suck it up.  If I can use that term right now.  Don't worry.  You're married.  You can't be gay.  Yeah, right.  You can't be gay.  You're married.  You can't be gay and married.  It doesn't work that way.  Right?  Right?  Fuck Hudson.  What?  What?  Does someone... 
[00:41:00]  What?  Let's go to Bobby Bigger.  Bobby.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  We're having a good time.  I want to protest the new format here.  What's with this Man Junk Monday?  Well, there was a lot of man junk on the season premiere of Oz last night,  and obviously a little man junk on Sex and the City.  Right, Rick?  All right.  Next, you're going to get to the story about the guy who got his schlong cut off by his wife, right?  Uh...  I don't know.  Was that down in Brazil or somewhere?  Oh, really?  What, again?  Another one?  Yeah, another one.  It's a dust. 
[00:41:30]  Well, we'll have to look for that.  All right, guys.  That'll go.  I'm going to listen to myself.  Thank you, Bobby Bigger.  Later.  All right.  Bye.  Well, we just thought it was pretty funny, Rick.  What did you say?  The quickness.  Like, you noticed how long it was up on screen.  Yeah, and it made me feel good that it happened very quickly and it was done with.  Unlike the...  Well, maybe you should.  The time length that you endured.  Maybe you should have continued with your thought.  I tried to, but you guys are already laughing.  I tried. 
[00:42:00]  Because you said, but it was really quick.  Yeah.  Right.  You weren't emphasizing...  Which is good.  You weren't even emphasizing the right words.  You're doing a fine job with it now.  Could have sworn I heard, but it was too quick.  No.  It was too quick.  That's...  I heard that.  Because that part...  When you heard...  When you heard that much, you shut off your brains and started thinking, okay, he's  a fag.  I didn't do such a thing.  We just thought it was really funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Bonnie. 
[00:42:30]  Let's see what Bonnie has here.  Hey.  Hey, Bonnie.  Hey, guys.  I'm one of your female listeners and I only have one thing to say.  Rick, you're a faggot.  Aww.  Later, guys.  Have a good one.  Well, here's someone defending Rick.  Nikki.  Nikki, what's up?  Well, you know, I saw the show and I thought the same thing, Rick.  It was really too quick.  She described the perfect...  Perfect man.  No, I didn't say it was too good.  And I didn't have an opportunity to see it.  And it sounds like you were just as equally disappointed. 
[00:43:00]  Aww.  You were disappointed, Nikki?  I...  Listen, I was very disappointed.  I love watching Stokachic Lampson.  Every now and again.  All right.  Thank you, Nikki.  Thank you.  Bye.  I didn't say it was too quick.  I just said it was good because it was quick, though.  Francine, what's up?  Hi.  I thought it was too quick, too.  And, Rick, don't worry.  It'll be repeated on Wednesday.  You can tape it and do it in still or slow-mo.  Slow-mo.  That's funny.  And we'll make it a screensaver for you, Rick.  That's good.  Send one to me, too. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Thank you, Francine.  Bye.  Look at John D. from Jersey checking and saying,  Yeah, you can't be gay and married.  Just ask Freddie Mercury's widow.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  I want to know if Rick's been offering all the guests coffee, tea, or me.  That was a nice callback.  Wow.  I remember that.  That was a nice callback.  That was going back a ways with Gay Marco.  Let's do a little play together.  Tim, what's going on?  What's up, guys? 
[00:44:00]  Hey.  Hey, listen, Rick.  I think the director's cut of the DVD is out next week with an extended view.  Oh, there you go.  So you can pick that up like they said.  You're making a screensaver.  All right.  You flaming fag.  Thanks, Tim.  John, what's going on?  John.  Yeah, Rick.  Is that me?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Yeah, Rick, I've got two words for you.  Gay porn.  You can watch as much of it as you want.  I also wanted to say I'm calling from D.C.  Love the show.  Been telling people about it.  I'm not going to be ready to pick up here until people stop being interested in the news 
[00:44:30]  again.  We shouldn't be too long here.  But I just wanted to say, man, after hearing the 50-gallon drum challenge replay, you're  happy.  I was in love with the show from that moment on.  God damn it.  We've got to do another thing like that.  50-gallon drum challenge, too, on the way.  Oh, that's crazy.  On the way.  On the way.  There is nothing more fun than torturing teen girls in 55-gallon drums with various  disgusting products.  You've got to bring back the hissing cockroaches.  You tell me.  I just sat there and damn near plus the gut.  All right.  Those screams on there. 
[00:45:00]  Like from a serial killer's basement.  Yeah.  It had the same tone.  It was great.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  That's the good news about syndication, by the way.  Yeah.  Ratings in New York, less gooder.  Yeah.  We still have 17 more cities.  Oh, to toil through and see.  We're going to do more gooder in.  All we need is to do more gooder in like two of them, and we'll be styling.  I know a couple we're going to do more gooder in.  Buffalo, we're going to do more gooder in.  Buffalo, more gooder.  I feel good about Cleveland.  Cleveland, more gooder. 
[00:45:30]  Cleveland, more gooder.  Philly, I don't know.  I think that comes out tomorrow, so we'll have to wait and see.  Tim Sabian from Philly, our PD there, sounded very, very psyched.  He was a cheerleader.  I swear I pictured him on the other end of that phone line with his little pom-poms and  his tight slacks.  What was some of the crap he was saying?  Don't worry about it, you guys.  Just do what you do.  You're going to be so surprised at the Washington and Philly numbers when they come out.  Like, that's not saying anything good.  Wow, I'm surprised.  I didn't think we'd take that big of a crap.  Doug from Springfield, calling back already. 
[00:46:00]  What's up, Dougie?  Have you heard the old saying where there's smoke, there's fire?  Yeah.  Well, Rick's a big flame right now.  Ouch.  Take it easy, guys.  Go sell your hair products.  No, Rick, this is too easy.  The hairdresser guy should not be calling in for any gay bashing.  Yeah, exactly.  He shouldn't be.  There's, I don't know, there's like 20 people that want to abuse you.  But we've got to move on.  We've got a very busy show today, right?  Of course.  Are we going to play the Muhammad Ali game?  Yeah.  I love that game.  You know what happened last time I got my hair cut? 
[00:46:30]  The goddamn, it's the first time it's happened ever, ever in my life.  Trim the eyebrows?  No.  Goddamn guy shampoo.  You've never been shampooed by a guy?  Never.  Always a girl shampoo.  That's why they call them shampoo girls.  Right, exactly.  So I put my head back in the sink, and I'm expecting one of the nice big-breasted girls  to come over and slowly massage my head.  My head.  And this guy comes over, and now I swear to you, I don't care. 
[00:47:00]  I was uncomfortable and conscious of that situation for the entire shampoo.  I like laying back, letting the girl do it.  It's nice.  You could close your eyes.  You're just very relaxing.  But when the guys, I'm sitting there like, my neck is all tense.  I just wanted it over with.  It was like a prison rape.  It's a drag, but you've just got to deal with it.  No, it's not good, and they shouldn't, they should not let the guys shampoo guys' hair,  because I'm not going to say anything like, hey, I don't want the guys shampooing my hair. 
[00:47:30]  But rest assured that it's uncomfortable for your male patrons.  It's a drag.  Ben and I get our hair cut at the same place.  Mark has shampooed your hair before, right?  Sometimes.  Mark.  You know his name?  Mark's a cool guy.  Mark's one of the coolest guys in, like, the village.  Yeah.  He went out.  Does he give it a happy ending, too?  Wow.  Let me tell you this about Mark.  Mark, the hair guy, the coolest guy in the village.  Oh, easy.  Slow down, Opie.  Slow down. 
[00:48:00]  At least I could get myself out of this.  This guy, this guy.  Leave that to us.  Well, this isn't going to help that much.  Now that I think about it.  Right?  Well, he dated Madonna.  Oh, really?  And he's in one of those tell-all books.  Oh, yeah?  Which one?  Morton?  I think Andrew Morton's Madonna book.  Brought it to New York.  Does he swing both ways?  This guy, no.  One way.  No, he's married and stuff.  I swear to God, he's so quick.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, Ray.  I didn't know you were still standing there. 
[00:48:30]  I think it's the Andrew Morton Madonna book that came out?  Yeah.  Andrew Morton actually bought photographs from this guy.  Oh, yeah?  He was hanging out with Madonna, yeah.  Did you ask him how it was?  Madonna?  Yeah.  It's pretty...  Yeah.  She doesn't listen, right?  Did you ask him?  No.  Yeah.  It's pretty funny, actually, because his wife works with him down there in this little, you  know, haircutting place in the...  Where is it?  East Village.  East Village.  And when his wife is out of earshot, he'll tell you some cool stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Totally.  What did he say?  Give me some dirt on what it's like to screw Madonna. 
[00:49:00]  No, I don't...  He never admitted to that, right?  Oh, come on.  Oh, no.  He never really got into it.  He said that he brought her here.  They were, like, dating, and, you know, he totally banged it.  But you could tell, like...  How do you not go, tell me what it's like to screw Madonna's wife is right there.  But as soon as they go, tell me what it's like.  Oh, we just got...  How do you not...  We end up whispering about it, because you can tell it brings back some great memories  for the guy, but he can't brag about it, because his wife's right there.  His wife's literally, like, less than two feet away from him.  Really?  So if she goes to get the mail real fast, or in the back room to get whatever, some dye, 
[00:49:30]  because he's doing a dye job, I don't know, he'll start opening up real fast, and then  he'll have to stop, and then we start talking about hockey or something.  So what's the best Madonna dirt you've gotten?  I haven't got...  I have the same problem every time his wife's there.  His face lights up, though.  Oh, I'll get some...  This is goddamn ridiculous.  I'll get some...  You know the movie that Madonna is remaking?  I don't know the name of it offhand, but he goes,  Dude, I was the one who took her to see that movie.  Really?  When we were dating back in the 70s, or late 70s, whatever it was. 
[00:50:00]  How about that?  Anyway, so...  Tuttle from New York, hair guy in the village.  I know.  You can't really recover from that.  I know.  You're right.  But sometimes you go down there, and he's the only one in the place, and he's like,  Oh, this is a drag.  I know what you mean, and then he's shampooing the hair, and you just...  I don't like that at all.  Oh, but you just deal with it.  You deal with it, but it's very...  It ruins the experience.  I like the girl shampoo.  The shampoo girl.  She gets down there. 
[00:50:30]  She starts talking.  She's like, Hey, nice massage on the scalp, and there's just the nice wafting fragrance  of female is there, and the boobs are there.  The guy gets over there.  You want conditioner?  No.  Anything to speed this up.  Don't even shampoo it.  Don't even wet it.  I'm done.  Bye.  Am I the only one that didn't do anything queer this weekend?  You're with Oz and the man shampooing, and you're with the... 
[00:51:00]  I'm the man shampooing.  Yeah, he's the coolest guy in the village, this guy.  This is revolting you with a TV.  This is awful.  He's right.  That's surprising.  We have to bring in more groups to our show.  Waving homos.  What can I tell you?  Okay.  We better take a break.  We got a good prank call to Ted Turner we got to play today.  We're going to play the Vikings song.  We've been playing the really bad football songs.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  We got to have Vikings.  We might even have to play the Jets song a little bit of it since they won.  I mean, it's almost like the Yankees, how you doing?  Get stinky in here.  He's so excited that the Jets won.  He is very excited.  You see him with his Jets wear on today?  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  Jets shirt.  Woo!  Sinky, how embarrassing was it that that's all that Vinny Testaverde could do on the last  drive of the game?  Got the job done.  Get us a 53-year...  53 sucks.  Got the job done.  Vinny sucks.  He didn't get that job done.  Did they win? 
[00:52:00]  Ah, that's all he cares about.  Did they get to the playoffs?  Yeah, Vinny got the job done, and so did Michael Strahan, of course.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  They both got the job done yesterday.  Did you see Vinny throw it right to the Raiders a couple times yesterday?  He sucks.  Tom Brady's going to choke, like, first year in the playoffs, he's going to do horrible.  The Pats are going down.  I call Stinky every week before I go to watch the Pats game, and he didn't even call...  He always calls me back and taunts me like the Pats are going to lose.  Didn't even call me back yesterday.  It's the first time I didn't see him.  You know what?  The Jets are doing to me what the Knicks have done to me in the last four or five years. 
[00:52:30]  Stretching out your agony.  Well, yeah, with the Patrick Ewing thing.  It's like, oh, we're going to win at this.  No, we're not.  We're not.  All right.  Patrick Ewing blew at the end of his career, and so does Vinny.  We limped into the playoffs.  We had to kick a 53-yard field goal.  John Hall.  And what's-his-name missed the blocking that by what?  A centimeter.  Hey, they're in the playoffs.  It's all in that.  That's all Stinky.  The most valuable Jets.  Yeah, and Michael Strahan really has the record. 
[00:53:00]  Brad DeLuiso is the most valuable Jets.  That's true.  If he wasn't kicking with Christopher Reeve legs, the Jets would not be in the playoffs.  But he stinks.  I don't feel good about this.  Coulda, shoulda, woulda.  They're in there.  I don't feel good.  I don't feel good about the Jets' chances.  There you go.  Who's in the AFC?  That's really a problem.  The Pats.  Eagles?  The Pats.  The Eagles.  The Pats.  Why are you saying Eagles?  The Pats.  Also, remember what you told me.  Stinky said he would kill himself if the Pats make it in the Super Bowl, 
[00:53:30]  so I'm going to throw you in front of a bus on 57th if they won the Super Bowl.  Slow down.  I wouldn't be hailing any, waving down any buses yet.  Don't worry.  All right.  You want to play a little something as we go to break here?  What do we got?  What do we got?  Ted Turner.  Pete Chris.  Yeah, the Ted Turner is good.  Didn't he do one before?  Yeah, this is our buddy Kid Chris from the station we're on in Sacramento. 
[00:54:00]  K-X-O-A.  K-X-O-A.  He's on after us, and he sent us a prank call to Ted Turner, and he did another one, and  he sends it in to us.  Yeah, the first one he did was as John Rocker calling Ted Turner, and Ted's just like, hey,  John, how you doing?  And then he realizes it's not him.  This isn't John.  This one he calls as the black newscaster, former newscaster from CNN, Bernie Shaw.  Bernie Shaw.  Remember Bernie Shaw?  So check this out as we take a break here. 
[00:54:30]  Hello?  Ted.  Yeah?  It's John Rocker.  John!  How are you, Ted?  I'm an idiot.  This is the John Rocker one.  This is the John Rocker one.  Everyone right now is going, this is the John Rocker one, you idiot.  This is the John Rocker one.  We heard this one.  Where's the Bernie Shaw one?  I like how Ted, like, answers all happy.  So it's like, hey, how you doing?  And then by the end, it's, uh, this isn't him.  We should have just played it out.  I'm sure there's a lot of people that never heard this before. 
[00:55:00]  Maybe we can play it a little later.  Do we have it yet, Ben?  I don't know what cleaned out the car.  Wasn't it?  I just saw it.  Like, recently.  We're the most unorganized syndicated radio show in America.  I guess that's why.  We can't do anything right.  Thank God we got some good witty banter.  We'll continue to flounder if we can't get on the ball here.  Well, it makes for a good radio tease.  The new, uh, prank call to Ted Turner is on the way. 
[00:55:30]  We'll play the one, uh, where John Rocker calls Ted Turner, all right?  Yeah.  And we'll be back.  Hello?  Ted.  Yeah.  It's John Rocker.  John.  How are you, Ted?  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?  I'm okay.  How about you?  I'm surprised I got you at this house.  Well, I'm glad you got me.  I was thinking about calling you.  Okay.  How are you doing?  Well, I'm doing okay.  Um, I really think I goof, though. 
[00:56:00]  Well, I know.  I mean, hell, I, you know, I've opened my big fat mouth many, many times.  Right.  In similar circumstances, I've apologized to everybody in the goddamn world.  I just was lucky.  I didn't say quite so much at one time and get in quite as much trouble as you did.  But on a smaller degree, I have.  And I, you know, hell.  I think it just got blown out of proportion.  Yeah, well, I agree.  I mean, and that's just too, too, it's just too bad.  You know, you've learned now.  You know, it's always best to, you know, if you can't say something nice, like in Bambi, 
[00:56:30]  what Thumper's mother told him, don't say anything at all.  At least that gets you out of trouble.  And the New York fans poured beer and spit on me up there.  I know, you know, anyway.  Did they trade you?  No, I just, you know, I'm just a dumb redneck.  You know, I got suspended.  You know, I just didn't know.  Oh, I know that.  All right.  I know.  Now, who had me suspended?  Did the Jews make me get suspended? 
[00:57:00]  You're not John Rocker.  That's the same guy that called me.  Oh, my God.  O.P.  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  Hey, that's the A-hole over there.  You C-sucking F.  Cool jack-off ass F.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, that's funny.  And E.  Here, checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area. 
[00:57:30]  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  Also, the FU line is open.  That phone number's up on opieandanthony.com, all right?  You want to play the Ted Turner prank call now?  Yeah, which, uh, we got the one with Bernie Shaw now.  We have it?  I like the Rocker one, though.  That's a good one.  I love when he realizes it's not Rocker. 
[00:58:00]  It isn't John Rocker.  Oh, for the love of Christ.  Oh, this is the same guy that...  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah.  All right, so this is Kid Chris from Sacramento calling Ted Turner.  It's Bernie Shaw.  It's Bernie Shaw.  The personal cell phone number of Ted Turner.  Hello?  Hi, uh, Ted, please.  Who's calling?  Uh, this is, uh, Bernard Shaw.  Can you hold on just a minute?  Sure. 
[00:58:30]  Hello?  Ted.  Bernie.  Bernie?  Yes.  Hey, how you doing?  Is this Ted?  Yes.  How you doing, Ted?  Fine.  How's everything?  It's okay.  All right.  Where are, uh, where's Snowcrest?  I don't even know where that is.  It's in Montana?  Uh-huh.  So, uh, I was wondering if it was possible, um, if there was a way I could make an appearance  on the WCW broadcast. 
[00:59:00]  Are you serious?  Yes.  To do what?  I want to be a wrestler.  I think I could beat that Goldberg guy and punk his ass.  Who is this?  Bernard Shaw.  This isn't the Bernie Shaw that works at CNN.  I'm the black one.  No, it isn't.  Hello?  Who is this?  Hello?  Hello?  Well, this isn't Bernie Shaw, I can tell you that.  Right.  You're Ted Turner.  I'm Bernie Shaw, the black one from CNN. 
[00:59:30]  I don't know who you are, but, uh...  Your wife is a babe, too.  I was wondering if there was a chance I...  Hello?  Not bad.  Stupid Ted Turner.  It's pretty silly, right?  He's just got time to sit there and, uh, take calls from people.  I love it.  And speaking of your wife, isn't the...  Go ahead, go ahead, Jim.  Is, uh, I don't know what it is.  Jane Fonda?  It used to be his wife, yeah.  Is, uh, being, uh, what is it?  One of the 100 most important women of the century.  Are you kidding? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, there's some type of, uh, of some prestigious award they give to women that she's being named  as one of.  Apparently, uh, C of the century was already taken.  Yeah.  Is the criteria for that, uh, climbing up on anti-aircraft, uh, machines of the enemy  and, uh...  God, is she revolving.  ...posing with, uh, the slimy little slope VCs.  Wonderful.  Wonderful woman she is.  Oh, she should just be shot in her stomach.  And then while she rolls around, I should make her watch her own films.  I like Barbarella. 
[01:00:30]  You know, on Golden Pond was an excellent film, but everything else she does, I despise.  You liked on Golden Pond?  I actually did, yeah.  Hepburn and, uh, Henry Vines.  That was a comedy for her.  Yeah, that's true.  It was great.  It was a brilliant film.  The loans.  Oh, I was lost.  He gets lost in the woods.  I love that one.  Poor old fella.  Come on, Grandpa.  Craig, what's up?  Poor old fella.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got this new multiplayer game called, uh, Medal of Honor Allied Assault.  Yes.  It's a demo.  Uh-huh. 
[01:01:00]  It's awesome.  It's awesome.  It's so violent.  Yeah.  They have a single-player demo out, too.  Yeah, let me tell you something, though.  Real violent, uh, very cool.  Where's the blood, my friend?  Yeah, well, you know what it is.  I blew some dude up.  No blood!  Uh, I think they're going to unlock that when the main, I think the game's coming out January 22nd.  They're not unlocking anything.  I read that, uh, this game, uh, Spielberg has something to do with it, with this game.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he had something to do with the first one.  I think, uh, PlayStation 1 version of it. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, it's sort of like, um, Saving Private Ryan-ish.  But the cool thing is, you get the rocket launcher, and I actually blew this dude about 10 feet in the air.  His back was all, like, uh, broken in two, and he fell down.  The graphics are great.  The gameplay is great.  Yeah, it's really cool.  But for some reason, they said, uh, so they could sell it to more people, and it wouldn't get the M rating, that, uh, they're not having any blood in there.  And then they went on to say something like, uh, Spielberg didn't think the blood was necessary. 
[01:02:00]  Well, he should be talking about the first five minutes of Saving Private Ryan.  Exactly, if it's supposed to be some kind of a World War II thing, you've got to be reminded that, um, war includes a lot of friggin' blood.  Yeah, I know.  And, and, and, and don't make it sound like a moral issue when you say you're taking the blood out.  It's so the parents can go, oh, this is good, this is a nice game for my kid.  It doesn't have the blood in it.  Are we going to have some Chicozo to get the blood in the game?  All right, guys, get it done.  All right, thanks, Craig.  I, I, I hope, uh, somebody's able to make some kind of patch for it like that. 
[01:02:30]  I'm sure they will.  There's, there's, uh, some pretty ingenious people out there with computers, so they'll probably make a patch for it.  Uh-huh.  But, uh, you know, to release it without the blood, eh, it's anticlimactic when you blow someone away and they don't explode.  Hey, P, what's up?  Keith?  Keith.  Uh, sorry, yeah, I was just wondering if you know about, um, Grand Theft Auto III.  Tried to go get it this weekend.  A lot of places didn't have it.  They said they pulled it off the shelf because it was too violent.  I never heard that.  We were talking to the guys at Rockstar on Friday, and that's a bunch of hog walk. 
[01:03:00]  I was at Toys R Us, and the lady said she had just yanked them off the shelf because they said it didn't fit in with their image.  You don't go to Toys R Us.  That's, that's, it's like, uh, Mr. Cleany Place.  I was at one of the, you go to a regular, uh, computer game store.  I was at the Walt Whitman Mall in Huntington this weekend, uh, Electronic Boutique, I think it's called.  Electronic Boutique.  Something like that.  They had.  Software, et cetera, Babbage's.  Oh, so that's not true.  They had hundreds of the game.  Hundreds.  So they're still releasing State of Emergency. 
[01:03:30]  We, we were talking to the guys from Rockstar, and they said that they're having a problem in Australia.  Yeah, Australia.  Meanwhile, Australia's burning down, so they don't care about the games right now.  Right.  But as far as New, uh, as far as America goes, no, we're fine with Grand Theft Auto 3.  Okay.  That sucks.  They want their image.  We're only going to sell things if three-year-olds can choke on nothing that shows violence.  Bunch of creeps with a giraffe.  Robert dead.  Uh, Jim noted the greatest.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  Just aggravates me.  They're our latest client.  What?  Toys R Us? 
[01:04:00]  Toys R Us.  Well, I mean, they're good for other toys, but not for those.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Who cares?  They're kids.  They always got the, the smallest, uh, uh, like the youngest kid section right when you  walk in, so you gotta walk through that section that smells like, uh, crap diapers.  Isn't that wonderful?  Yes, absolutely.  I'm sure you like that, but.  What, in Toys R Us?  Yeah, like you walk in and it's all the play school stuff when you first go in, before  you get to cool models and games and whatnot, and you walk through, it's like, ugh, kids 
[01:04:30]  drooling on stuffed animals.  You remember I trashed JVC on the air?  Yeah.  And I got a letter from them?  Uh, I actually am really good friends with the guy now, and he was gonna fix my thing  for me, because they're really nice people, and I feel like an ass.  You whore!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it hasn't been fixed.  I lost his number, that's what I'm saying, if he's like, please call.  No, I'm worried about JVC.  Okay, you want to be a whore, then, and you need his number to be a whore.  No, no, no, no, I don't want anything new, just my thing fix.  Rihanna sounds cute.  Rihanna, what's up?  Hello, Rihanna.  Hello.  Actually, I'm just crying, because I think it's a riot that you guys are having this demographic 
[01:05:00]  thing with the females, because all my girls and I sit around and play Grand Theft Auto 3,  and we cut our heads off, and we listen to Opie Anthony, and I just don't understand why  all the chicks aren't listening.  No, we think the chicks are listening more lately, because we...  Yeah, we're noticing.  We have softened our delivery.  We're not as abrasive, yeah.  I think the abrasive is good, though.  I mean, all my friends and I hang out with the guys, and we love that.  I mean, that's the way we are.  We drink beer, we watch football, we play rugby, you know. 
[01:05:30]  Wow.  We like sex.  It's just like...  Are you hot, though?  You like sex with men?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, the most important one?  My boyfriend gets worn out sometimes.  Oh, yeah.  You don't have one of those dikey haircuts, do you?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I'm not.  Actually, I'm just a college student.  You don't wear big sweatshirts from Nantucket, do you?  No, I don't, actually.  I just moved out here from Salt Lake City.  A big Cape Cod sweatshirt from where?  Salt Lake City.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, so you must be going wild. 
[01:06:00]  Actually, I moved out there with my boyfriend, and I couldn't handle the culture.  They don't have hardcore porn.  I love you.  I mean, the state doesn't allow penetration, and it just cracks me up.  Is that a dry city, too?  Oh, yeah.  Like, you're not allowed to have booze in there?  There's three liquor stores in the whole town.  Three liquor stores.  A million population, three liquor stores.  They're all state-owned.  Salt Lake City.  They close at 9 o'clock.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, with your Mormon mentality.  I think you guys are awesome. 
[01:06:30]  I think you're funny.  Why'd you go there?  My boyfriend and I, we've moved around a lot.  You know, we're 22.  We wanted to have fun.  So you picked the most boring...  So have fun, Salt Lake City.  Boring city of America.  Mormon capital.  You know, I met a lot of kick-ass people there.  You know, they're repressed, and we brought out their fun side.  Oh, wow.  It was fun.  Wild.  Mormons are one step away from Dianetics.  Oh, there you go.  It's like being a wild kid in Boy Scouts.  You guys think spray paint and write go on stop signs? 
[01:07:00]  No, actually, no, we...  Don't over the stop?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Turn the 55 into 85.  Whoa.  I guess we can speed here, hon.  The best that we did consisted of having sex at all the national parks there.  All right.  A little sex for Sam Salt Lake City style.  There you go.  Wow, you sound like a wild chick.  Oh, I try.  Now you're back.  You ever have sex out in the open in the desert?  Yeah, it's fun.  There you go.  I mean, there's always people driving around. 
[01:07:30]  There's always the risk of getting caught.  It was just a lot of fun.  The Mormons driving around.  But out here, you know, I hate to say it's a little more conservative.  You know, I don't need as many crazy people as I did out there.  More conservative than the Mormons?  Where is she, though?  Where is she going from?  Yeah, where are you right now?  I'm calling from...  I'm above Boston.  I'm in Essex.  Oh, Boston.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, yeah, I don't know.  I just...  Yeah, Boston is conservative, definitely.  Yeah, it's very...  Everyone's like, Boston's cool, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, Jesus Christ, you know.  How many turtlenecks can I see in one day? 
[01:08:00]  Speaking of Boston, Menino's sworn in for his, what, third term as mayor of Boston?  The goddamn guy's holding the office like a pope.  I know, right?  I...  You know, I just got registered to vote, and I'm just sitting here, you know, laughing,  because I can't...  I can't handle it.  Good for Boston.  Well, anyways, I need to let you guys go, because I'm driving on a really icy road,  but I just wanted to tell you what's up, and that you're great, so...  All right, thank you.  Thanks, wild chick.  You're welcome.  Keep her on the road.  Wild chick. 
[01:08:30]  Keep her between the ditches.  You gotta love Boston, though, man.  They love Menino.  They elect him again.  Why can't we have Giuliani again here?  It's ridiculous.  Term limits suck.  Let the voters decide.  Slow down.  Let the voters decided.  Please.  Boston.  The corrupt little government.  The corrupt police.  It's amazing up there.  Just amazing.  You don't like Boston today.  Boston is...  You're making fun of their mayor, their city, and their football team.  I love it.  We've only been on the air an hour.  I love Boston. 
[01:09:00]  I love going up there.  I have fun every goddamn time I go up there.  But let's not let that put on these little filtered glasses and not see the truth of the matter up there.  There's nepotism in every bit of their government.  Billy and Whitey Bulger is enough.  Enough said right there.  How does a head muckety-muck have a mobster for a brother?  It doesn't...  It's all who you know.  People stay in office forever. 
[01:09:30]  Teddy.  Up there.  Teddy Kennedy.  Look at that.  They love their Ted.  He's a fine senator.  That guy's amazing up there.  He does a lot for a master.  He's a fine senator.  It is the one...  It is a commonwealth opening.  And it's the one part of this country that works like no other part.  They do things up there with impunity.  If a cop gets in trouble in New York City, what happens?  He's held up and flogged in front of the public. 
[01:10:00]  A bunch of public interest groups are able to just nail him to the cross.  It's an abomination.  Up in Boston, it gets swept under the carpet so quickly.  Good.  Hey, I admire that.  Yep.  What the hell?  Go, Boston.  You know, Bugsby, you almost said, let's not kid ourselves.  You almost said...  Did I?  I hope if I did, you would have come over and smacked me in the face, Norton.  Let's not kid ourselves.  Hudla, hudla.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:10:30]  Hey.  I heard you guys talking about Grand Theft Auto.  I wanted to know if either one of you guys got the Disney World yet.  What do you mean, Disney World?  There's a cheat.  When you finish a mission, you can go to the roof of a building and fly a helicopter to an island called Disney World.  No way.  Stop it.  Guys, you fly the helicopter to an island called Disney World.  When you get to the island, it's a bunch of tourists.  The cops are dressed up as pink rabbits, and you can mug the guy dressed up as Mickey Mouse and take the costume. 
[01:11:00]  There's no way.  I'm telling you.  That sounds a little too detailed to be made up.  I'll email you guys with the cheat code if you want.  All right, and we'll check it out.  If it's for real, we'll send it on to everybody else.  All right, cool.  Thank you, Chris.  All right, Sarah Jessica Parker is the white Shannon Sharp.  Nice.  All right.  Thank you, sweetie.  Oh, wait.  That's great. 
[01:11:30]  By the way, we have some audio of the pinball machine being smashed.  We're going to play that.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to play that in like a half hour or so.  Poor Al Dukes, his disappointed little face.  Have you said hi to him in the hallways or anything?  Man, there's no saying hi.  What do you think this is all about?  I understand.  All of a sudden, it's like, okay, well, that was fun.  Now I'll start saying hi to you.  No, I'll leave him alone.  He leaves me alone.  He could have a fine little career here at this radio station.  Until he tries. 
[01:12:00]  He doesn't need to know me.  Hey, you want me to go?  Until he tries to buy you something else.  We have the audio.  We'll play in the five o'clock hour.  But there's a great video clip if you're near your computer on foundrymusic.com.  Foundrymusic.com is our underground website.  You can get to it through opianthony.com, right?  Norton saw the video clip.  It's cute, right?  What a sociopath you look like with those awful goggles and the big sledgehammer.  Bob Vila goggles he's wearing.  Well, I didn't know what was going to happen.  It blew up real good.  This whole mental patient. 
[01:12:30]  You know, there was a glass cloud for about a half hour after that was smashed.  Yeah, the glass was pulverized.  And a lot of the glass was pulverized down to powder.  Where did that end up?  Where did the machine end up?  Stinky.  It's still out there?  It's still out there?  Yep.  The machine is, yeah.  The skeleton of it is out there?  Stinky cleaned up the whole mess.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Has he been trying to play it?  No.  You know when I wanted to knock the whole thing over and you screamed at the last second,  no foosball table?  Foosball table. 
[01:13:00]  So I threw it the other way or tipped it over the other way?  Yeah.  Right onto the lesbian couch.  A lot of people horrify that that went on.  Well, Stinky was cleaning up the lesbian couch and getting all the glass out of the cushions  and stuff.  He finds a used apparatus, let's say.  A dildo.  A dildo.  It was a big dildo.  In the cushions.  Joe Dildo.  In the cushions.  In the cushions.  Who...  Where did that pop out of?  Good thing someone didn't sit on that.  Huddle, huddle.  I just wonder which one of our guests... 
[01:13:30]  I don't know.  Forgot that.  I'm thinking it might have been the soccer mom.  She's a wild one.  So the video clip is up on foundrymusic.com.  If you want to check it out, okay?  All right.  Oh, uh, the Jim Norton Talking Doll.  I thought they did that for Christmas.  Oh, no.  We updated it, my friend.  Check it out.  Looking for that perfect gift to bring home to the kids?  It's the Jim Norton Talking Doll.  You stink.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show, and you've probably seen him receiving yellow  discipline in cheap motels. 
[01:14:00]  Shut up, stupid.  Now you can bring him home.  Just squeeze his mule and let the sparks fly.  I hope you're killed in a motorcycle accident.  Made entirely of recycled rubbers and stuffed with nails and broken glass, the Talking Jim  Norton Doll is fun for everyone in the family, even mom.  Just keep filleting your husband until he pays the bills.  Oh, that Jim.  What will he say next?  I'm a meaty-breasted little nothing with an hour of material.  It's an educational toy, too.  Who better to learn about the birds and the bees than from Uncle Jim? 
[01:14:30]  It's not rape if they blink twice for yes.  Comes complete with martini glass, shaker, and vial of urine, some assembly required.  Shut your yaps.  New from Stinko.  It's the Jim Norton Talking Doll.  Guys.  Available where Megan's Law doesn't apply.  You guys have superior ratings beyond belief right now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  N-E-W.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:15:00]  Anthony, look who's in the studio.  Ron from Ron and Fez.  They're on after us here in New York City.  Ronnie.  What's up, Ron?  I stopped by to play some pinball, but I forgot.  See?  You're coming early to play some pinball, and there's just a pile of crap out there.  I think I'm going to get a nice machine for everybody.  Oh, that'd be great.  Oh, one of those Toys R Us plastic ones.  I'm going to get a nice machine for everybody, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'll make good.  Sure. 
[01:15:30]  You're going to get a nice pinball machine, yeah?  You see the video clip on foundrymusic.com?  I haven't seen it yet.  It's pretty twisted, I've got to admit.  You know, I've got to be honest quickly just about that pinball machine.  I didn't like it as far as the gameplay went.  As far as basically, you know, it might be a collector's item.  It might have been a great piece of work.  I don't know.  As far as gameplay went, it sucked.  It didn't have enough gadgetry going on in there.  I like spinning things.  I like a lot of action.  And the ball got lost down the left side every time. 
[01:16:00]  I think you fixed that with the first smash.  I had the line of the night that no one heard.  After it was all said and done, yeah, there was a little problem.  Down near the flipper on the left side, the ball would keep going, you know.  Well, you know, there's that little gate where if the ball goes in front of the little rail,  it'll go in front of the flipper and you can hit it.  Right.  If it goes behind the rail, it's a dead ball.  It's gone.  Right.  And that little gate was broken, so the ball was slipping under it,  and you'd lose it even if it was going to go in front of the flipper.  So if the ball goes down the left side, guaranteed you lose the ball every time 
[01:16:30]  because this thing was out of place.  Thanks, Mick.  So after I smashed the whole thing, now we could get inside and go,  hey, look, we can finally fix this part of the game.  Fixed it.  Fixed it.  See, until you actually broke it, I thought maybe you were joking and you weren't going to swing it.  But I had the mic up close so we could get it on the air.  All that little tiny pieces of glass, this glass cloud, all in my face, all night long I'm itching.  I pull about a quarter inch of one out of my eyelid a little later on in the night. 
[01:17:00]  A shard.  A shard.  A shard.  I had a shard there.  A shard.  Yeah, I was itching all night long, man.  Two of my favorite pinball games ever made.  I used to spend hours on these.  The Terminator pinball.  Oh, yeah.  That was very good.  Very, very big.  Get the CPU.  Remember that?  Bang, bang, bang.  A lot of action going on.  And the original, the first Addams Family movie game.  That one I don't remember at all.  That was a great one.  No clue.  Babushka. 
[01:17:30]  Babushka.  I hated pinball.  Oh, come on.  Obi, why do you hate everything?  Yeah.  I'm good at pinball.  Obi ought to blink his eyes at Al.  Maybe he'll go out and bias those two.  Yeah.  Notice I gave you two very good suggestions.  Terminator, Addams Family.  I'm thinking I want the Ms. Pac-Man Gallagher thing back, though.  Gallagher.  All that crap on your computer.  True.  I'm surprised Anthony's not playing the Oz game.  Oz.  Where you got to get the ball in that.  Oz.  You and Fez ought to have an Oz watching party. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, yeah?  Would he be up for that?  He's up.  Are you kidding me?  He's way up.  He's way up for that show.  You don't watch the Oz run?  No.  No Oz?  You don't?  You're a Sex and the City, Queer as Folk type of guy.  I don't.  I watch you.  We're just Folk.  I watch Project Greenlight.  Oh, is that what you watch on HBO?  Yeah.  Where they're putting it together?  Don't you watch that and just watch Ben Affleck and see?  Look how drunk he is.  Right.  Drinking the sponsor's beer.  Yeah, he's drinking all the Sam's.  I'm like, look how drunk he is. 
[01:18:30]  He literally, in the first one, they had to give away who was going to get the million  dollars to make the movie.  Mm-hmm.  He didn't decide until he was drunk and some kid told him a sob story.  Yeah.  He just gives them the milk.  Yeah.  And this is the worst possible movie you've ever seen.  It was awful.  Yeah.  It was that one, uh, god damn.  Yeah.  Like two kids who try to find God and they're eating.  Oh, it was awful.  Yeah.  It looked like a badly done after school special.  Yeah.  Horrid.  And then, you know, he got a little tanked up on the Sam and gave him the milk.  Had a soft spot.  Yeah, why not? 
[01:19:00]  He ended up with you guys are great.  Yeah.  I want to congratulate Ron and Fez.  They did pretty well in the ratings.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Are you kidding me?  That was a good day for the Ron and Fez show today.  They went up.  They're more gooder.  Come in.  They were more gooder than the last time.  We're less gooder than the last time.  We're less gooder.  Yeah.  You're more gooder.  Well, the problem is you had to follow yourselves.  We were luckier.  Well, we give you a little lead in.  Sure.  No, no, no.  I'm saying that you had to follow your last book.  We had a different. 
[01:19:30]  There was somebody else there last book.  Ah, that's true.  Sure.  I didn't even think about that.  Was there?  Yeah, we had the tape show.  I'm losing track at this point.  Yeah, me too.  I don't know who does what around here anymore.  Well, you know, we try to move every three, four months and Jeremy's looking at the schedule now.  It's good.  That way no one really knows where you are or how well or badly you're doing.  For a year and a half, we've just been saying, yeah, I'm picking up a buzz.  Yeah, yeah.  No matter what's up, I feel it in the phone.  I'm feeling, I'm hearing a buzz.  I see it in the email.  We're doing good. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, the phones are just popping.  I'm surprised.  I'm surprised you saw Jeremy today.  He ran out to Kinko's earlier.  Oh, did he?  Oh, the Kinko's run.  Is that where you got to make copies of certain college documents?  Well, you know, resumes, you know.  What are you kidding?  It's the only station that can have a goddamn 1-3 and still everyone goes skipping through  the hallways hanging up pictures of you, too.  We'll find something.  We always find something to be happy about.  How do you feel about that? 
[01:20:30]  Have you noticed the band?  Yeah, I noticed that.  All the pictures, like, well, that's a little weird.  Rock of New York, maybe.  Hey, it's not like I've never worked with music.  I love it.  You're kidding me?  I love the 80s.  Ratings, do you like that?  Ratings come out, they suck, and next thing you know, there's all these bands all over  our walls.  Yeah.  Right.  So you figure it out.  Yeah.  Rock of New York.  Classic rock, classic jocks.  I hear they're bringing Scotso back.  I'm just throwing some rumors out there for the New York radio message board.  All right.  Classic rock.  So what are we doing?  Are we going to play the clip of... 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  I'm waiting for it.  We're going to get in a little while.  We're going to play the Muhammad Ali game as well.  Ah, that's a fun game.  You know what we have to bring up is the Melissa Rivers thing.  She seems marital troubles there.  No.  Yeah.  No.  Can you believe it?  She married this millionaire, what's he, a horse trainer or something?  Yeah, he's something.  He's something.  A lot of money.  Something with a lot of money.  Just because he rides her doesn't make him a horse trainer.  Well, yeah.  I know what that... 
[01:21:30]  Hee-haw!  Long, thoroughbred face she's got.  Well, she...  So now it seems that they're in marriage counseling.  This according to Cindy Adams.  She knows everything.  She's out and about in New York.  That woman knows everything.  I saw her once.  Actually, we were...  I guess my mother and grandmother were going to a Broadway show.  So I got them lunch at Tavern on the Green.  So they could go to Tavern on the Green in Central Park.  What? 
[01:22:00]  It's Mom and Grandma.  You're not a Tavern on the Green type of guy, though.  I stopped in and sat there to have a little lunch with my mommy and my grandma.  Why don't you meet your agent at Sardi's?  At Sardi's, I was meeting my agent.  I was at 21.  You did Nello's?  Yeah.  That's where I was.  Yeah.  I was going to come up for some nice lunch before the show.  Tavern on the Green?  Before the matinee.  Yeah.  Carnegie Deli.  It's like a nice place.  Give me a sandwich.  Anyway, Cindy Adams is sitting... 
[01:22:30]  Go to Planet Hollywood.  More of a Planet Hollywood type of guy.  Go open.  Cindy Adams is sitting there holding court, pretty much.  She sits there, and she's at the head of the table, and she's got Minion.  Minion.  They just sit there and blab, I guess, to her.  And she has actually a little pad.  She's writing down who's coming, who's going, what they're doing.  I guess that's how she gets her info.  How does a lady like that have any friends? 
[01:23:00]  Do you want to hang out with her?  You know what?  There are certain people that could do anything, and she'll write good about them.  Those are her friends.  The other people are just, you know...  If you dime on your friends, then she'll write something good about you.  There you go.  See?  So they have sources.  She has her sources.  Write sources.  So she found out, I guess, that Melissa Rivers, Joan Rivers' daughter,  having marital problems, and she was recently on some private yachting event,  some yacht time with Joan Rivers, without the son-in-law. 
[01:23:30]  Said it was a private yachting with her mother, Joan.  Very private.  It seems the son-in-law wasn't invited.  That's how she words it.  She words it like, very private.  You see this scumbag not invited.  So, and they're going to a marriage counselor.  And all I could...  I just got to sympathize with this poor guy that's married to this Melissa Rivers,  because could you imagine that a mother-in-law being that Joan Rivers? 
[01:24:00]  A woman that pretty much, I'm sorry, drove her husband to kill himself.  Edgar.  Edgar.  I'm sitting shiver for my Edgar.  Edgar.  Wow.  And then, now she's your mother-in-law?  What are you doing?  And she looks like one of those mother-in-laws that would just get involved in every facet  of the marriage that you have to the daughter.  Because she's always, hey, Melissa, every time I'm on TV, I have Melissa with me. 
[01:24:30]  I have to mention Melissa.  Like, it's just always there.  You're doing it wrong.  Get off of her like that.  You're pumping all wrong.  This is a picture right there in the sack.  Melissa, you don't have to put that in your mouth.  I never did that.  Don't buckle under it.  You're Melissa Rivers.  You don't have to put that in your mouth.  You don't have to put it in your mouth.  Box of wine.  Three rice bagel left.  Don't.  Son-in-law, could you, over Christmas vacation, please hang a garage door opener for me. 
[01:25:00]  Good call.  I'm sorry.  I'm living my own hell here now.  I just know she seemed like that snooty type of, to bail out now.  It's only three years in.  The guy's a multimillionaire.  You know that he's just going to get raped.  He's renting Edgar's old suite in Philly at that hotel with the two and all's and the  tiny little hotel whiskey.  Little nips.  A little whiskey nips.  He had them all lined up.  Oh, God.  He thought real hard about it.  Life or Joan? 
[01:25:30]  I like Joan Rivers.  Oh, stop it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop it.  Where's the joke?  No joke.  I always liked her growing up.  I always liked Joan Rivers.  I really did.  I'm not kidding.  I mean, if I hated her, believe me, I'd blick her.  Why do you like Joan Rivers?  Seriously.  I always...  Because she's the guest host of...  You think she's funny?  Yeah.  I mean, she's the guest host of The Tonight Show.  Oh, wow.  Just when...  Wow.  Look at this.  I think I know Norton.  He takes this turn.  I liked her.  Come on.  Where's the... 
[01:26:00]  With cancer?  No, no.  Something.  I grew up watching.  I'm a big Carson fan.  What about the bucket of AIDS in the face?  Nothing?  Not for her?  No, no.  Cindy Adams?  Yeah.  Not her.  I've been announcing the death of my dog Spike.  With a dog?  What?  That whole attitude of hers is completely against anything I would think you would.  You don't wish the kneecap cancer on her?  No, no, no.  No, no.  I always...  There's very few women I find that funny.  I found her, Carol Burnett.  There's a very few that I really enjoy.  Wow.  There are two of them.  Carol Burnett.  I don't know how I got her in the middle. 
[01:26:30]  Carol Burnett.  I adore Carol Burnett.  She's hilarious.  You like the skit where she came down with the curtains as the...  The dress.  Look, Carol Burnett, any woman that's not afraid to not be hot is the ones who are going to be funny.  That's why Roseanne used to be funny.  When she started to...  Like, you know, she wants guys to...  Don't ever say she was hot.  Jim, we don't need female listeners this bad.  No, no.  I'll be honest with you saying how we're going.  I get it, Jim.  Nudge, nudge.  No, no.  Are you softening your delivery?  Look, any woman that's not listening should be raped and have her arms cut off and thrown in the ditch. 
[01:27:00]  Bye-bye, ladies.  Hey, you're going to get eight years for that.  Yeah.  Norton's been booked in one of those ladies' take back the night comedy festival.  Oh, God.  He'll be plugging that in a week.  We call them the...  You know what we call those shows?  The Unts of comedy.  When was Roseanne funny?  Her first special where she was wearing a house dress and she was miserable.  That was the young comedian special that Rodney brought her on. 
[01:27:30]  No, the first time I ever saw it, and it was the same one Kinnison was on.  Right.  And she was funny on that.  And she did her own special, which was great.  I'll give her that.  I'm saying, then she tried to look hot and lose weight and get the tattoo and nobody wanted to look at her anymore.  And when was Carol Burnett on it?  Tom Arnold.  Carol Burnett was great.  All the great sketches.  I love Carol Burnett.  Sketches.  How about Phyllis Diller?  I don't...  I'm not familiar with her work.  You know, Fang told me...  Ugh.  Yeah?  You're kind of digging up.  What about Lucille Ball?  You know what?  You like the Lucy? 
[01:28:00]  Just talking about her last night.  I respect her.  I like Lucille.  I like the early black and white Lucy from I Love Lucy.  The other one, Miss Carmichael.  Miss Carmichael.  Stunk.  I didn't like that.  I like the one where her husband used to lock her in her own house.  Yeah.  What an abuse show.  You're not going to the club.  Lucy.  You could just tell he was beating the crap out of her.  Yeah, he was.  Tope.  We just saw a clip of one of the Lucys where she had the big headdress thing on. 
[01:28:30]  And she wanted to be the lead in the dance number when they went out to Hollywood.  And she comes down the stairs and starts stumbling.  She reached up to straighten her headdress.  You notice on her bicep, there is a thumbprint black and blue that you know is just Desi grabbing her.  You effing bitch!  I will kill you!  I kill you!  You'll do this right!  Then he comes home late at night and does those Cuban lines off her ass and forgives her.  You know he's just banging every Hollywood fan. 
[01:29:00]  You want to audition at Desilu Studios?  You come in, baby.  I'll show you the way.  Don't worry about Lucy.  We have an understanding.  It's wonderful, wonderful.  Lucy, you bitch.  I thought William Frawley was the funniest thing on I Love Lucy, man.  Yeah.  Ah, Bill Frawley with the pants up to his nipples.  Just drunk all the time.  You gotta be soft.  Hated Ethel.  Dealing with that Ethel.  Vivian Vance.  Hated her.  That's great.  Hey, Rick! 
[01:29:30]  He's quite a hot little number.  Tony, what's going on?  23 Skidoo, Rick!  Hey, how you guys doing, man?  Happy New Year.  You too, Tony.  You know what?  Every time I'm thinking that I can't get shocked anymore by your radio program, Norton will say  something along the lines of, oh, I like Joan Rivers.  Yeah.  That's shock radio.  That Mambo No. 5 was a great tune.  I really do like that.  That's shock radio.  I'm not trying to be different or like, hey, I'll throw the guys a curve.  I really do like that.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Jim Dorn. 
[01:30:00]  Thank you.  You want to marry Melissa after she dumps this guy or he kills himself in a hotel room?  Marry her.  Please.  Obi couldn't look so disgusted right now if Ron and Fez's producer had his mule out in  his face.  As disgusted as he looks at me right now.  Well, you shocked us.  You did.  I wasn't expecting that from you.  What's your favorite thing Jones sells on QVC?  What's your favorite bobble?  I have the bee, I have the little bee encrusted with semi-precious gems that is available 
[01:30:30]  now.  Give me money for another facelift.  I'm not talking about the little.  I wear my ovaries as earrings now because I've had so many facelifts.  I don't like the fashion show.  I don't watch that crap.  I just like the ripping on Liz Taylor for being a fat pig on national television.  Nobody did that.  And she was doing it on the Tonight Show calling Liz Taylor a fat pig.  He likes Joan Rivers and he enjoyed on Golden Pond.  I thought it was brilliant.  Wow.  It was brilliant.  This is a new Norton I'm seeing here.  On Golden Pond wasn't about the yellow discipline. 
[01:31:00]  You know that, right?  On Golden Pallet.  Wrong film.  I got lost.  I saw that in the theaters, actually.  I wanted to see a 3D Parasite movie.  And my Jewish friends and his mom took me to see it on Golden Pond and I really liked it.  3D Parasite movie, huh?  Yeah, whatever it was called.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, Norton likes Joan Rivers.  It's official.  He's all came out of the closet today.  No, no.  Joan Rivers isn't gay.  I mean, there's nothing gay about liking Joan Rivers.  I don't watch the fashion stuff. 
[01:31:30]  Her entire following, gay guys.  Hey, Anthony, you giddy.  You giddy, Benson.  Hey, how can you tell she had a black and blue when it was in black and white?  All right, it was a black and gray.  Yeah, okay.  Hey, hey, hey, you two will listen.  And after today, we all know who's going on with George, don't we?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah!  Ha-ha!  Cool!  All right, Jack, thank you.  A little reference for New York if you're listening to morning radio this morning. 
[01:32:00]  A lot of things flying around today.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Who do you think is going to win the Golden Hanger Award this year, Jim?  Joan does the Golden Hangers for the best dressed.  A couple of years back, it was J-Boy.  J-Boy.  I actually thought that was an abortion award until you just missed it.  The Golden Hanger.  I honestly don't know.  I'm not familiar with the Golden Hanger, and I don't care.  I'm not into fashion jokes.  And, oh, who's going to get the best dressed?  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  That's what she does now.  I don't care. 
[01:32:30]  You like Ruth Buzzi?  She does.  You like the girls from Sex and the City when they're chuckling?  Well, I've never seen Sex and the City.  Never saw it.  I could almost understand what you're saying about, like, the old Carson things, things like that.  But who, like, just for nostalgia alone, but you could have said the old Joan Rivers or the Joan Rivers of years ago.  You still enjoy her.  I haven't watched anything she's done recently.  I don't know her.  Turn on E!  I'm out there at every award show.  Yeah.  Don't watch.  I don't know.  Okay. 
[01:33:00]  You know either TV.  I don't watch it.  But when she was calling Liz Taylor a fat pig, and Liz Taylor tried to sue her, that was great.  Nobody would say, Liz Taylor is a fat pig with brain cancer.  And it was great that Joan Rivers was thrashing her.  You're like, um...  You're like an Amish.  You're like a chick.  You're like the Amish as far as technology goes.  You don't watch TV.  He doesn't go to movies.  You know nothing about video games or computers or nothing.  You are an Amish gentleman.  He has wooden toys.  Yeah.  Like the wooden train. 
[01:33:30]  Like toys like they had for the kids on Little House on the Prairie.  Paul would whittle him something out in the Soddy all year, and then wrap it up for Christmas.  He has a wooden condom.  So he really doesn't even have to be into it.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Fud.  I don't wear condoms.  Believe me.  I don't care.  You don't care.  He's a mule.  What am I going to do?  Catch AIDS twice?  He's a mule.  Yeah.  He tells me all the time he's a mule.  He's a carrier. 
[01:34:00]  Mike will cure that.  You like the Golden Girls, Jim?  Someone's asking him.  Yeah, I did like that.  Yes, I did.  It was funny.  It was funny.  Now I'm totally calling you out that you're goofing.  No, I'm not.  Well-written show.  Very funny.  Rue McClenahan.  Yeah, and Bea Arthur was great in that.  And Betty White played a great dummy.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I love it.  I really like the Golden Girls.  I don't know.  That show, how many, first of all, it disgusted me.  These old crows talking about how they banged all night. 
[01:34:30]  Rue McClenahan comes down the stairs.  Where were you last night?  Let me tell you.  And then she makes some subtle, she was getting plowed until the sunrise joke.  And the image of Rue McClenahan with the wrinkled up varicose thighs in the air made me sick.  But again, there's certain things, like there was really sarcastic Bea Arthur.  There was a complete dummy and a slut.  And the senile old mother that you could see was looking five feet to the right of a camera reading her cue cards.  Wasn't that awful?  She was horrid. 
[01:35:00]  But she was great, don't forget.  Oh, those seen all-off jokes.  Oh, God.  Isn't that hysterical?  They should have just looked at the camera and said, none of us have been moist since 64.  You're right.  That would have been funny and true.  Couldn't get wet at Niagara Falls.  You want to host a vagina monologues, Jim?  Is that what you're going for?  A very funny show.  I'm waiting for that to...  No?  No, I did like the...  No, no, I don't like all that.  I like the Golden Girls.  I like...  If I like it, I like it.  I like it.  Wow.  True.  Holy uber fag.  You can never call us a fag again. 
[01:35:30]  Yes, I can.  Uber fag.  Oh, you can't.  Yes, I can.  That's more faggy than anything Ann and I have talked about today.  No, it's not.  All right.  It might be a little bit corny or older, but it's not necessarily mule-in-mouth.  He was goofing on me for playing EverQuest online.  Yeah.  I didn't watch the Golden Girls for 12 hours.  It was on for a half hour and I left.  Oh, if it was on, you would.  I certainly would.  You'd check out the marathon.  Got to see if Rue's going to hook up with her gate for the night.  There's always some younger guy that you're looking at going, he would never be tooling this old broad. 
[01:36:00]  But Ann, I've never even seen the show.  Oh, I've seen the show.  I swear, I've never checked it out.  Actually, an old girlfriend loved the goddamn show and I'd sit there and this was before computers.  You know, everyone had computers back in the Stone Age.  And I'd sit there and have to just watch.  And it was awful.  I see a trend here, though.  Golden Girls on Golden Pond.  Yeah.  That's a golden.  Golden.  Is that a golden boy?  Golden goodness. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  A little salty yellow loveliness just to warm your throat and teach you who's boss.  Glenn agrees with you here.  Glenn, what's up?  Yeah, totally.  And I'm all men here, fellas.  I don't agree about the, what's her name on E?  The sexual preference.  She's disgusting.  But Golden Girls?  Stop it.  It's already underrated, dude, as far as the writing was really great, man.  It was the same friggin' show.  Every goddamn week.  No.  I mean, when you look at the writing of, like, Friends, I mean, it's all cutesy. 
[01:37:00]  At least they had mean lines to each other.  They would try to shock each other with the sexual innuendo.  Oh, that's this show.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  I got confused for a second.  We're like Three's Company.  Hey, listen.  What's up with that morning show with this guy with the froggy voice from, you know,  way back in the day?  That's got to go, bro.  Oh, Scotty?  No, he's terrible, man.  The morning sports guy show?  Holy, you know what?  I like the guy.  Oh, man.  His voice is cool, man. 
[01:37:30]  You got to check him out.  Our new morning show, you got to check him out because he will blow himself up eventually.  I'm telling you, his head sounds like it's going to explode right off his shoulders.  My freaking throat hurts after listening to him.  He's a talented guy there.  I have no doubt about the fact that he knows his business, but his voice is grating.  That's what's grating.  You don't know when it's going to go.  Yeah, I'll tell you, I'm not a sports fan, O&A.  I'm not a sports fan, but I listened to that show for hours because of him.  There you go.  It's a good thing.  That is a good thing.  We need some ratings around here.  Hey, no doubt, man.  I love the station. 
[01:38:00]  I love all the talk stuff, man.  All right, Glenn.  Thank you.  All right.  Later, boys.  Can I clarify real quick?  I also, my favorite sitcom is probably Taxi, All in the Family.  I mean, I don't just watch.  All right.  Taxi, all right.  Honeymooners was brilliant.  Oh, of course.  Seinfeld, I was never a particular watcher of.  I didn't watch it.  I like the Seinfeld.  Yeah, it was good, but I didn't watch it.  You guys are really killing me.  Scott, what's up?  Scott, what is this?  The view I'm listening to?  Jesus Christ.  The view?  The three of you are tools today.  I mean, those actually are not tools today. 
[01:38:30]  What is going on with you guys?  And at this point, we're just saying things we like.  I like milk.  Oh, gee.  Hey, I'm joking.  Who cares?  You're like Seinfeld or didn't like it.  You're right.  You're right.  Cereal's good.  He's trying.  You know what he's doing.  I like Captain Crunch in the morning.  How about you, Jim?  He's trying to justify by saying these things that he likes to make up for on Golden Pond  and Golden Girls.  I'm just saying I balance.  One more thing before I go, guys.  You balance.  Oh, you better look out.  Rick might try to steal your girlfriend out there.  Later, Deke. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Nobody cares.  I hope you had a good point.  It's like we're just starting to list things we like.  Jim Norton from Bizarro Planet.  Yeah.  Trisha's saying I want the old Norton back.  Golden Girls?  It's the same me.  This is the last call and then we'll move on here.  Pull the curtain back.  Trisha, what's up?  This is absolutely disgusting.  I listen to you guys every day on my way to work.  I want the old Norton back.  Trisha, I haven't...  That's absolutely gross.  I can understand Joan Rivers.  Norton?  Golden Girls?  Come on.  It's like a geriatric sex in the city. 
[01:39:30]  Trisha...  You don't need to hear that on the way to work.  Trisha, Trisha, I haven't changed.  James, believe me, if I'm hanging out with you and you pass out, I'm banging you.  I'm not any different than I was that week.  I just want the Golden Girls on while I do it.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I appreciate that, but come on.  We need some crudity.  I'm on my way to work.  I need to hear some nasty stuff on the radio.  All right.  You're a dirty girl.  Nice.  Like a dirty bitch like that.  Ain't that nice?  Yeah.  Gordon just wants more girls to love him.  No, no, no.  The type of a girl...  Oh, no, no.  On the face.  On the face.  That's the type of gal I need. 
[01:40:00]  That gal's a go-getter.  Or any of the...  Why?  Why?  Why?  All right.  Well, isn't that episode 56 of Golden Girls where Rue McClenahan takes a mouthful?  From Stan, the ex-husband.  Well, listen, man.  We've got to take a break.  When we come back, we've got the audio of the pinball smashing.  What the hell?  All right.  We'll do that next for you.  There's a clip on FoundryMusic.com if you want to check it out.  A video clip.  All right.  And we want to thank Ron from Ron and Fez for stopping by. 
[01:40:30]  Hell, yeah.  On after us here in New York City.  The show doing even more gooder.  Ron and Fez doing more gooder.  More gooder.  Opie and Anthony less gooder this time around.  Yeah.  But still number one in the male demos.  Yes.  Which is gooder-er.  We have to say that because the bosses say that.  That's how they're going to spin it in their little memo.  Good news, guys.  You're still number one, men, 28 to 29.  No, when it starts going to that point, it's over, Johnny.  All right.  Stay there.  Opie, and Anthony. 
[01:41:00]  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  A show that's heard in 18 cities.  Yes.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4-WOW.  See the naysayers back, Opie. 
[01:41:30]  Back again.  Well, the ratings for New York came in today.  And, well, the boys took a hit.  And pretty much everyone is saying it's over for the Opie and Anthony show.  It's over, Anthony.  Yeah, that must be it.  It's over.  A lot of the, um...  After three and a half years, you and I are done.  Oh, my God.  We've taken a hit.  We've taken a hit.  We haven't even really taken a hit.  Still number one in the male demos.  That's what we were hired to do. 
[01:42:00]  It seems...  But as far as bragging rights go, the overall number, the 12...  Wow.  They call it the 12-plus, Anthony?  Yeah.  That means everyone that listens to the radio over the age of 12...  Yeah.  We took a hit.  Yeah, sure.  We'll tell you.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  It seems, um...  Yeah, we're done.  We went as far as, uh...  Overall, uh...  The 12-plus ratings, we went from, I think, 12th...  Uh, fourth place to eighth place.  Yeah.  Oops.  Oh, well.  Well, they're back.  They're back. 
[01:42:30]  Uh, the same, um...  The same people.  Um...  That constantly say, whenever the ratings, uh, take a dip, that we're done.  We're back again.  Some people suggesting that we should have changed our whole delivery after September 11th.  Yeah, that must have been it.  Yeah, that's awesome.  That'll work.  We should have adjusted our show.  And our show...  What?  What are you, insane?  Douche.  You know what?  We did what we could.  As far as that situation, and now we're doing what we know best. 
[01:43:00]  I was thinking about, um, the, the whole, uh, uh, 9-11 situation, how I felt and feel about it and everything.  And, um, you can feel the, uh, country not forgetting stupid, uh, but dealing with it and getting back to doing things that we were doing.  And, uh, that's all.  That's all.  You think...  If you think it was easy to just tune in and have fun on, uh, this show or other shows, it wasn't fun doing this show for quite a while after 9-11. 
[01:43:30]  Never mind listening to it.  You know?  I was one of those that were constantly glued to the news stations, too.  I still tune in a lot.  I like to know what's going on.  Well, there's no secret, the news station in town, both news stations in town went through the roof, and, uh, you know, conservative talk, uh, went through the roof.  Well, when you see, uh, that the Opie and Anthony show, uh, went down in the overall rating, and you sit there and say, well, it's over. 
[01:44:00]  O&A show done.  People don't want to, uh, hear about that stuff anymore.  They don't want to hear about T&A anymore, obviously.  And then you look at the same, uh, ratings book, and you notice that the news stations have never done so well.  The, uh, political and news talk shows have never done so well.  And other shows, uh, that are, uh, similar to this program are in the same boat. 
[01:44:30]  They took a hit, too.  I think you gotta assess everything.  You gotta look at all the things that have been happening, and take it for that.  You know?  So, you know, fine.  You know, get on the, you know, radio, New York radio message board, anything else.  Here's your chance to crow.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'll wait.  Type.  Go ahead.  But, they're saying stuff like, we told you. 
[01:45:00]  I know.  We told you.  They went last.  Same people said that, uh, after we were on the air for two weeks.  I, exactly.  That's why it's like...  This show will never last.  We're, um, you know, as Opie has reminded us, in, uh, many cities across the country, and  doing very well.  And we're doing very well in New York.  Yeah, the 12-plus number that they put in the paper, you know, you're gonna see that.  Oh, boy, ONA take a dump.  You think our pictures will be in the paper? 
[01:45:30]  That's just it.  It's like knowing how much we suck.  That's just it.  No one really cares.  That's true.  No one...  I think there's bigger, uh, things to report about in the paper.  I feel good about the show.  If you remember...  If you remember to...  Up...  Right up till September 10th...  We were rocking.  Holy smoke.  Remember all the, uh, interviews?  We were rocking.  Every other day, we'd be talking about some dope that came in here to interview us.  There were, uh, taped interviews for Bill O'Reilly. 
[01:46:00]  Film crews line up.  Fox...  We did a, we did a sit-down...  2020...  We did a sit-down interview with Bill O'Reilly that no one will ever see.  No one will ever see that, because it's, it doesn't matter.  People in their cars are now going, yeah, sure you did.  I matter.  Can't, can't, um, uh, Mark, uh, get it?  Because he works at Fox.  We should put that up on our, uh, website.  I work for Bill O'Reilly.  That thing was days away from being aired.  Yeah.  But, um...  It'll never see the light of day now.  Right.  Because of the things, certain circumstances that happened after September 10th.  Uh, things like that didn't happen. 
[01:46:30]  But people have very, uh, short memories, as far as things like that go.  Well, you know what it is, Ant?  You read on the message board.  It's like, what happened?  Um, I haven't been hearing the buzz about, uh, the ONA show, or even I read on the, uh,  that message board that the, the buzz about the Ron and Fez show, too.  Did you read that string a while back?  It's like, don't seem to have the buzz.  What dopey radio show has a buzz?  The buzz of the bombs falling on Afghanistan.  That's a buzz. 
[01:47:00]  The buzz of, uh, uh, a big lot in southern Manhattan.  That's a buzz.  But you know something?  People are very resilient.  And we snap right back into doing things that we enjoy.  And one thing is mindless banter that is enjoyed on a daily basis driving home with this show.  That's it.  We survived the hit.  I wouldn't worry about it.  There's a lot of people out there that don't want to see us succeed as a show.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  So when, like, we take a little hit in the ratings, and I mean a little one. 
[01:47:30]  You know, they, they, they crow.  But like this guy here.  They're very happy.  Like this guy here says.  Ha ha.  Uh, anytime we do better in the ratings, those people that, that have bashed us.  They go away and hide.  They disappear.  Like cockroaches.  And they wait for the next time we have a little ratings dip.  They disappear.  Yeah, well.  But there you go.  So, it's, you know something, though?  Remember, we gotta give them this time. 
[01:48:00]  This is their time to crow.  We'll have fun with it.  Remember two years ago when Tom, uh, Tom, uh, Lickass told everyone that we were done  as a show?  When we took a little dip?  Mm-hmm.  And turned around six months later and had the best ratings ever?  It, it, it just happens.  What happened to him?  Where is he now?  There are, uh.  Oh, yeah.  He's not on this station anymore.  That's right.  Ed, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Listen, we gotta mobilize the army.  I can't remember the last time I saw a wow on live TV. 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  We haven't hit the, uh, TV news spots or anything lately.  It just hasn't been, uh, very important to people to do things like that.  It hasn't come to mind.  You know what I mean?  I know, but it's gotta get back to normalcy.  So, we gotta just remobilize the troops and get out there.  It will.  It just takes a little time.  Wait, I don't want to confuse people.  We're fine with what we're doing.  We're fine with our show.  We're happy with our listeners.  That's it.  It's all these ass wipes that want Ant and I and this show to fail that when something  like this happens, they'll blow it out of proportion and get very excited about it. 
[01:49:00]  There you go.  All right.  We gotta...  We're not changing anything.  We got some great, great, uh, things around the corner that we're gonna be doing.  The Virgin Contest.  We'll talk about that very soon.  There you go.  All right, Ed.  Who is thrilled about that?  You gotta start training the affiliates out there on the network now, though.  Hold on, but that's another thing I want to say.  We're gonna get 17 more ratings books in the next, uh, two weeks.  So we'll see where we're doing well and where we're doing bad.  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[01:49:30]  I think Philly comes out tomorrow, so we'll have a report on the Philly ratings tomorrow.  Oh, Philly doesn't come out?  Um, I thought Philly came out January 25th.  Why January 25th?  That doesn't make any sense at all.  Oh, no.  Here it comes.  No, no.  I didn't...  Oh, I missed up the dates.  I'm...  The ratings book is tomorrow, because I'm gonna be...  You know, that was such a sloppy plug.  I'm turning your mic off.  Oh, wow.  I'm not even gonna let you finish.  That was horrendous.  You were stammering and stuttering. 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  That was...  That was horrible.  It was just panic, because you said 5.20 is the biggest listening time in, like, three minutes.  Oh, you bastard.  Nice callback, though.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Don't worry.  Don't worry about the ratings drop.  As soon as Gary turns 12, he'll get a boost in the 12-plus rating.  Yeah, he's turning 12 soon, so...  There you go.  I'll tell you what.  You guys made the best of a bad situation with that 9-11 coming from one of the police officers  that was there that day and was there just about every day afterwards.  It was for you guys. 
[01:50:30]  Giving us a little joy, it would have been tough to take.  So, appreciate it.  Well, we're not worried.  I mean, they're gonna spin it like crazy in the press and on these message boards and  stuff, but we are fine.  I think some people are underplaying the impact they had on...  You know, I know myself, if I was a casual radio listener and I got a ratings book shortly  after September 11th, I'd be like, you know something?  Who cares?  You know?  I think I got better things to think about and worry about and, you know? 
[01:51:00]  It's just odd.  And I think people downplay the impact of listenership and, you know, things happen  like that.  I gotta say it again, though.  We're still kicking Mike and the Mad Dog's asses.  It's...  Yeah.  I don't...  Killing them.  Oh my God, watch him.  Now he wrote it down.  Did he write it down?  You wrote your own plug down?  I want to plug...  He's a great man. 
[01:51:30]  I like Ed Good.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  For the guy that said new wow on TV, can you say Madison Square Garden WWF tonight?  Oh, yes, I can say that.  I'll be watching.  Even from Cleveland, maybe.  Hold on.  Do we have a trip to give away to the Royal Rumble?  Oh.  Oh.  Yes, we do.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, you effers.  Here's your chance.  Here's your chance to come out in numbers and you get a prize out of it. 
[01:52:00]  Unfortunately, I think this is going to be a contest open for mostly the, you know,  the New York audience and the family audience because Raw is back at the Garden tonight and  I think they're doing Smackdown tomorrow night.  Right.  So you got two chances.  The best O&A sign we see in the next two days will win the trip.  How's that sound?  To the Royal Rumble.  Right.  A trip for two to see WWF's Royal Rumble in Atlanta on January 20th.  Trip includes round trip airfare and hotel accommodations. 
[01:52:30]  Trip courtesy of the WWF.  Triple H back tonight.  I'm watching.  WWF's Royal Rumble only on pay-per-view.  Call your pay-per-view provider to order now.  Two days to get it done, guys.  Best sign we see, okay?  Okay.  Has to say Opie and Anthony or O&A or wow, whatever.  And then something, you know, you could throw on a show-related thing.  Whatever.  Size does matter as far as these things are concerned.  The last time we did this, I think the guy was in the front row, right?  Uh-huh.  It took up the whole background. 
[01:53:00]  It's huge.  Of the TV.  Yeah.  The sign had to be five feet high by 12 feet long.  Yeah.  Big, huge whack.  I'd have been pissed if I was behind him.  True.  So, contest on, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  We got the audio of the pinball smashing, finally, Anthony.  Because, look, it's 525.  Very good.  There's a lot of people listening right now, so.  Yes, Jim?  I can't do it sneaky.  I just got to do it straight.  For Philadelphia, January 25th.  No.  Oh, God. 
[01:53:30]  No, you're going to have to be like a typical whore, and you're going to have to try to,  you know, fit it in.  Now you got to find another spot.  Wow.  Got to take us by surprise.  That hurt.  11 p.m.  We can't change the show now.  You got to do your plug whoring.  I figured the ladies weren't listening because of certain things, and I'll just change it  around, and I don't like when he sneaks them in.  All right, Ed, you want to give the quick setup, pinball smashing?  Yeah, well, Al Dukes, the producer of Ron and Fess Show, and you, Rocky, a little relationship 
[01:54:00]  here at the station.  And he seems to adore you for some reason, and you hate him with every part of you.  And he decided he was going to do something to kind of patch things up, break the ice.  It's not even hate, really, because I don't really know the guy.  I just don't want to know him.  Okay.  I think it's more hate, but what I see is hatred.  So he bought this $3,000 Rolling Stones vintage Bally pinball machine and brought it in. 
[01:54:30]  Not for everyone.  Didn't say this is a gift to the station.  He said, this is for Opie, hoping that this is going to break the ice, and you two are going  to become pals.  Yeah, there's a video clip on foundrymusic.com.  There's still pictures of the whole incident.  The one where I have my big goggles on, and I'm just staring.  That's me staring right into his face just before I did it, by the way, just in case  you were wondering.  But here's the audio as it went down on Friday.  Right.  No.  All right. 
[01:55:00]  He's got the sledgehammer.  Oh, my God.  Hey, all I got to tell you is maybe someone should shield their frigging eyes.  I predict Opie cutting his wrist.  I don't think he's going to do it.  Jesus Christ.  Look, look, man.  It is.  Dude, it's a classic.  Don't.  Oh, he's almost fell off the chair.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's like a movie from Christine.  No, no, no, he's got it. 
[01:55:30]  He's got the big Gallagher mallet.  It took like a year to find that thing.  Watch this.  Where's Al?  Make Al watch.  Wait a minute.  They're blown him out.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  They're blown him out, Opie.  Have you ever seen Rambo First Blood 2?  He got you this thing out of the goodness of his heart.  This is just going to be like that scene in Rocky 3 where Polly throws the bottle.  Right through the pinball machine.  Oh, look at his face.  Oh, no.  I mean, this is what you want to do.  There's Al.  Hey, Al.  Hey, Opie.  I dare you to smash it.  It's so sad.  There's your voice. 
[01:56:00]  It's so sad.  With the mallet.  I dare you.  This is so cool.  I mean, I just got it as a gesture.  Hey, Al.  We accept Visa, MasterCard.  This is a business relationship thing.  Oh, boy.  There's a governor.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  It's gone.  Oh, no, no.  The loose ball table.  Look out.  Did you hear that?  There's pinball collectors throwing themselves out windows. 
[01:56:30]  Keith Moon lives.  Keith Moon lives.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  That's copyrighted material.  There is one heartbroken little Nancy boy out there.  Dude, he completely didn't think you were going to do that.  He totally should not believe you were really going to do that.  That's what I think of your gift.  I can't believe it.  And that's what I think of you. 
[01:57:00]  That pretty much said it all.  That's what went down on Friday.  Yeah.  And if you want to see footage of that, where is it?  It's at eatabullet.com.  Oh.  Oh, no.  He's got a plug in for his website.  See, that's good, though.  You're back to the old Norton with the shameless plug.  No, foundrymusic.com has the video clip.  That one was done well.  And then Steve put this little thing together as we go to break, okay?  All right.  About the whole incident.  I'm a kook magnet, I swear to God.  And one of them works for Ron and Fez, the show that's on after us here in New York. 
[01:57:30]  He's their producer.  Well, that's what they call him.  Al Dukes is a fag, basically.  The guy is attracted to you.  I don't think I've ever said hi to him officially.  No.  He bought me a present.  A $3,000 classic Rolling Stones pinball machine.  It was just, I brought a nice gesture.  Oh, God.  He's got the big Gallagher mallet.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Make him kiss Mick Jagger goodbye.  Oh, my God, no.  No.  Oh, no, he's got it.  Smash.  Oh, my God. 
[01:58:00]  Keith Moon lives.  Keith Moon lives.  Oh, no, no, the booth is on the table.  We're down.  Smash.  A work relationship.  Smash.  I was just making nice gestures.  Oh.  Smash.  Smash.  Smash.  Smash.  There is a mess out there.  No, it looks like James Bean's car.  Opie lost his effing mind. 
[01:58:30]  It's gone.  There is one heartbroken little Nancy boy out there.  That's what I think of your kids.  And that's what I think of you.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know what it is.  So, again, listen to you guys that drive down there and bash your heads in with a baseball  bat.  M-E-W.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yo.  Yo. 
[01:59:00]  Yo, what up?  We're not changing for anyone.  This is what it is.  Have fun.  People suggesting we should change our showing to reflect the events of 9-11.  Whitey.  Adjust what we do, what you and I do. 
[01:59:30]  Ain't gonna happen.  It ain't gonna happen.  Are you gonna hog those videos?  Hell yeah.  This sucks.  You've never talked about hockey before.  Stop it.  Hockey fights?  It's a lot different than...  And you got three videos there and you're not even gonna give me one and then you have  two and I'll bring back the one and trade it for another one. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, man.  You made fun of the hairdresser earlier.  Why was he gonna give you the tapes?  I didn't know he was bringing them in.  I got three hockey fights tapes.  What are they?  What are they called?  Well, one's called Blood on Ice.  Oh, that's gotta be great.  Get Doug in here.  I don't even know if he wants to talk about these up here.  Because supposedly this one's really rare.  Which one?  I can't read his handwriting.  The Bruins fights?  Yeah, Bruins and the Flyers.  Bruins and the Flyers?  1968 to 1979. 
[02:00:30]  That's when they really fought on ice.  They owned it up.  It's not like today's fighting with the helmets and crap.  It's just different Bruins and Flyer fights.  Come on.  And then you also have Gillies going at it with...  Nice.  Gillies going at it with O'Reilly.  See, this...  I love the fights.  Anthony, let me interrupt.  I love fighting.  They don't play hockey in a jail cell, so I don't know if you'll like that.  Any naked men in these videos?  And then there's another one, Bruins' Flyers fights. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, 1970 to 1979.  That was the golden era of hockey fighting, Anthony.  Today they got the helmets and the visors and nothing big.  They hurt their knuckles at all.  Break them up too soon.  Right.  They'll be wearing dresses pretty soon.  The one that's called Blood on Ice, what's on there?  Just bloody hockey fights.  Just bench-clearing brawls.  They don't even have bench-clearing brawls anymore.  All the blood just running down the faces, the missing teeth.  Great stuff.  Cool.  How long are these tapes? 
[02:01:30]  Two hours each.  Two hours?  You've got six friggin' hours of hockey fights and you're not even going to give me one tape.  No, we'll watch them together in the back office.  No, we won't.  Sure we will.  Where are those going?  Tonight.  Home.  See?  God damn it.  Which one's the best one, Doug?  All three of them are the best.  See, that's why I can't...  Joe, give me one!  If Doug would say, well, this one isn't as good as the other two, then I'd give you that one.  You know how that works.  And it's not even friggin' right.  How about if I leave Blood on Ice in the office? 
[02:02:00]  No, because then you're going to take it home.  No.  I will bring these tapes home and I'll bring them back tomorrow.  And we will show prep tomorrow by watching Blood on Ice.  I want...  Which means we'll have a great radio show tomorrow.  You could pop that in the VCR in the office.  And after the show, I think everybody would like to maybe watch a few hockey fights.  Yeah.  I got a choo-choo train to catch.  Well, that's your problem and you'll have two other tapes.  I just think it would work very nice if...  Sorry, you got to catch a train. 
[02:02:30]  You'll flee here.  But you know, you got to leave a tape.  You're irresponsible when it comes to this stuff.  Oh, stop it.  You see your desk?  It's going to stay right at the...  You see the stuff on your desk that you forgot about years ago?  I still got it.  You don't know you got it, though.  If I need it, I know who to look for.  Right, Ben?  I got the hockey fights.  This is the same strategy.  It'll be in my book bag and I'll bring them back tomorrow.  You can't watch all six hours tonight because you go to bed at midnight, you get off at  seven, you won't be home till eight.  That's only four hours.  You won't have six hours to watch.  Plus, he wants to watch WWF. 
[02:03:00]  Right.  I'm going to watch the one blood on ice tape.  You got to leave one tape here.  No.  You got to leave one tape here.  No.  No.  I ain't right.  Don't even make sense.  No.  Don't even make sense.  Anthony, I didn't know you were into sports.  That's not right.  I like hockey fights.  Who doesn't like a hockey fight?  I didn't even know you liked hockey fights.  Everyone likes hockey fights.  What fag doesn't like hockey fights?  Every fag doesn't like hockey fights.  What real man doesn't like hockey fights?  Fags like the fighting, too, I'm sure.  I tell you who doesn't like hockey fights. 
[02:03:30]  Huh?  I'm a Ranger fan.  Theo, Flory, where the hell did he go Saturday?  He got thrown out of the game or something.  He got a misconduct penalty on Saturday against the Flyers.  He leaves the building.  No, no.  It wasn't even a misconduct.  He was going to the penalty box for two minutes and then he...  Against the Flyers, either.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, the Penguins.  And then he just decided that he had enough and he left the arena.  That guy's got some issues, man.  Hell yeah, he does.  How great is that tape?  Have you watched it yet, though?  Which one?  Have you watched the tape yet?  I just got them.  Oh, okay.  You've got to put it in while you're on the air.  Minutes ago. 
[02:04:00]  That thing's unbelievable.  I've got to ask Doug from Springfield if we could put a few clips on foundrymusic.com.  What?  Well, you made it sound like these are gold and you'll get in trouble for handing them over to me.  See, Ant, they're very valuable.  Yeah.  I'm going to keep them right over here.  Thank you, Doug.  But tomorrow we have something to look forward to before the show.  To look forward to?  What is it, a cookie?  My connection from Massachusetts hasn't sent down the homemade pornos in a while.  No.  I don't know. 
[02:04:30]  Those are some great tapes.  Send more.  The blonde getting it after the pool party in the backyard after everyone else goes home.  That sweaty fat guy, though.  With the night vision camera.  It's hilarious, though.  Just two middle-aged heaps of garbage.  Yeah, he's pumping them by the pool and then he pulls out a beer bottle and starts drinking his beer.  Well, at one point he takes, you know, it's a plug for Budweiser.  He takes his Budweiser and pours it on the area.  Yeah.  Pours it all over the area and then digs in. 
[02:05:00]  Dig in.  Ladies, that's not to be romantic.  That's to kill smell.  That's why we put things on there.  Oh, my God.  Al, what's up?  Hey, where can I score those tapes, man?  I've been looking high and low.  Can't find them.  I'm surprised that no one has put out a really good hockey fight tape.  Hey, I know where they are and I can't even see them.  They're right here.  Is there any way that I can get one somewhere?  Does anybody know of any place?  Yes.  I can't.  Eatabullet.com.  Oh, stop!  Stop! 
[02:05:30]  Stop!  Let me ask Tom.  Tom has a question about the tapes.  Tom, what's up?  On that earliest tape, does that have the Larry Zydell hockey fight?  I mean, a stick fight?  What's the Larry Zydell?  The guy almost practically got his nose hacked off.  No.  I mean, it was very bloody.  That was in the 50s.  No, it wasn't in the 50s.  The Flyers didn't exist in the 50s.  Oh, Larry Zydell.  Who's that, Norton?  Is that Norton?  No, it's not Norton.  I don't watch hockey, so I'm quiet when they talk about it, sir. 
[02:06:00]  Really?  Go eat a bullet, Norton.  Norton doesn't do anything, we're finding out.  How are you supposed to help our show if you don't know anything?  I was chatting before about Joan Rivers.  I was very well informed.  Very well informed indeed, yes.  How about something from this new century of ours?  Well, does it have...  Is that on there or not?  It doesn't have that.  I don't know what fight you're talking about now.  That was the expansion year in 68.  Yeah, that's the year, the first year of the Flyers.  No, it doesn't have that. 
[02:06:30]  Ah, that's a shame because he practically got his face ripped off.  It was great.  I'd love to see that.  Blood all over the ice.  They didn't even have a red line anymore.  It was...  The whole thing was red.  You guys ever go watch on ESPN Classic?  The old hockey games where it was chain link fence instead of...  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of the plastic glass.  And the goalies without the mask, obviously.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Any of those maskless goalies and...  There's a couple in those tapes.  Yeah.  Do you have the chain link...  No, the chain link fences had to go away in the 60s, I would assume. 
[02:07:00]  Early 60s.  But they didn't have the plexiglass yet, so it was chain link fences up.  I wonder why...  Over the boards.  I want to get one of those tapes.  Tomorrow, man.  Something to look forward to.  Yeah.  It's something to frigging just, like, tease with.  Anthony, I...  That's what it is.  Have you always gotten what you want, and when you can't get something, you're like...  No.  No.  Just talking about it.  There's three tapes there, and I think if I...  Yes, Tom?  ...wanted one, I should be able to have one.  Opie.  Yes, Tom? 
[02:07:30]  Stop being a selfish you-know-what.  Yeah.  And give him a tape.  You're not going to watch six hours tonight, for God's sake.  Thank you, Tom.  Yeah, but what if he gets the better tape?  So?  You won't know?  We'll get it back tomorrow.  I will know, because we're going to talk about what fights we saw.  Opie, let's ask Anthony.  No, now you just talk about what fights you saw.  I'm not giving it to you.  Because I'm not going to be able to sing it.  Can I make a point here, Anthony?  What?  I got a gift, and I'm going to enjoy the gift.  Because you were saying in the office after Fry's show that no one will ever give us anything again. 
[02:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  See?  I enjoyed this.  I won't be smashing this.  You won't smash it.  Of course not.  There's a lot of things I haven't smashed that people have given us.  The homemade pornos from Massachusetts I enjoy.  Right.  They're still piled up behind my desk.  The motorcycle stunt tape.  Still have that.  You took time out to copy those and bring them in.  Yeah.  That's very nice.  Why?  I guess you didn't have enough time to whip one up for me.  I begged him.  I didn't know you liked hockey. 
[02:08:30]  I've been asking.  Hockey fights.  Ed, you're not paying attention.  I don't like NASCAR.  I like NASCAR crashes.  Ed.  You're getting the gist of what I'm talking about here?  I didn't want to sit for hours watching cars going around the track, but when one spins  out and bursts into flames, I'm there.  You're a bloopers fan, basically.  Right.  I love the bloopers.  Well, you're not getting the hockey bloopers tape.  Well.  You're not paying attention either, my friend.  What?  You know how many times he's been on the phone and I'm begging him for the hockey fight tapes?  Not once did you say, Doug, while you're getting copies for Ope, could you get me a copy? 
[02:09:00]  How many times have you been on the air?  A lot.  And I've been begging.  I'm like, where are the tapes?  Where are the tapes?  I finally got the tapes.  All I know, when Steve C. whips up videotapes of pornographic events that have happened in  this station, he hands one to you and one to me.  That's respect.  That's what that is.  It's a total lack of respect.  That's what that's all about.  What the hell are you making a videotape for me?  You cutting hair?  Come on. 
[02:09:30]  How'd it go?  No, I'm just saying.  It's like, why wouldn't you think I would have enjoyed hockey fights?  By the looks of your hair, I'll give you my card.  Thank you.  You look like you parted it with a firecracker today.  Whatever.  Ow, Diana.  Hi.  Hi, what's up?  I wanted to know if Gordon would like some golden discipline from me after his show at  the TLA on the 25th in Philly.  What, are you doing it on your phone right now?  That was a great plug, thank you.  And I certainly would. 
[02:10:00]  You're welcome.  How about I get tickets?  What, you're into that kind of thing?  Sure.  You will do that to Norton after the show.  I get tickets.  Oh, that phone sucks.  Where are you calling from?  From the wing of the Delta?  Oh, yeah.  You want to see me break Norton's heart right now?  Diana.  Yeah?  Your phone is pretty bad.  Yeah, I know.  So, why don't you give Jim your email address before it goes bad.  No, don't give it up. 
[02:10:30]  I don't have an email address.  Oh, Jim, why don't you give her your email address?  It's, no, because he's going to shut my mic off.  So, I won't.  How are you guys going to connect?  If you want to go to the show, you can go to it and say hello afterwards.  All right.  I won't try to plug it.  I'm not going to get out any tinkle drinker at AOL.com's email address.  Oh, you bastard.  Hi, Diana.  Call back if you get your phone work in there.  Well, thank you, Doug, for the hockey fight tapes. 
[02:11:00]  No problem, guys.  Guys?  What are you saying guys for?  I didn't thank you.  Okay, girl.  Sorry.  Ooh.  I think Doug's still pissed because you made fun of him on the phone earlier when he called  him.  You made fun of him?  You did poke fun at him.  Poke anything.  What did he say when I hung up?  Nothing.  No, nothing.  It was cool.  Huh?  I didn't say anything.  There's a good hockey fight website, Ed.  You can check that out.  Oh, great.  Hockey fight page.  In two hours downloading two seconds worth of video. 
[02:11:30]  Great.  What is it called?  Hockeyfightpage.com.  Hockeyfightpage.com.  What about Hockeyfights.com?  That's a different one.  That's another one.  There's tons of links up here.  Look at them all.  Oh, all right.  We'll get some of these links on foundrymusic.com.  Have you ever seen a tape of hockey fights?  Dude, I love hockey fights.  Okay.  Who doesn't?  It's great.  All right.  Should we take a break?  And I think we're supposed to play the Muhammad Ali game today, Ed.  Have fun sitting there alone watching your hockey fights.  Yeah.  That's it.  Just sit there alone at home watching your hockey fights. 
[02:12:00]  Anthony, I'll send you one personally.  How's that?  Oh.  See?  Make you feel better?  See, he just forced his hand.  Now he feels guilty.  He's going to run home and make you a cup.  Not today.  Ooh.  We're going to launch this tomorrow, pal.  Tomorrow.  Me and you.  There's no need for...  There's no need to wait until tomorrow for me anymore at this point in my life.  When I was a kid, fine.  It was always mommy or daddy telling me, I got to wait tomorrow.  You'll get it tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  There's no more tomorrow.  I want something.  I want it now.  We have different schedules. 
[02:12:30]  That's how I live right now.  Now.  I have to get out early tonight and we'll watch it together tomorrow.  Just think of the fun when we push play in the office.  No, because then you'll be like, oh, wait.  Oh, watch this.  Watch this.  This is a good one.  Watch this.  No, I won't do that.  Anthony, he'll have popcorn for you.  I won't do that.  Now you're making me feel guilty.  I don't want any hockey fights.  I'll watch them with the guys.  I don't need my own copy.  Although, if anybody has a copy of the Andrea Yates smothering, that I would love to watch 
[02:13:00]  on a video tape.  Maybe a funny musical background.  And a little one pops up.  Boop.  And then a two.  John, what's up?  Yeah, Opie.  Yeah.  Tell Anthony it's not right.  For fellow paisa, Anthony, I'm going to take care of you.  I got to take that to Opie with love.  I got New York Island on the hockey fight from 79 to 88.  I'll trade you blood on ice. 
[02:13:30]  I got that too, my friend.  Now I need a copy of that.  So, Anthony, you got a little blackmail here, you know?  You can do a little trade.  It's not today.  All right.  That's why the whole thing.  You're going to be on.  The whole thing of it is today.  You're going to be on Evercrack after the show anyway.  I can still watch TV while I'm metting.  No.  No.  I'm building up my mana for the next spell.  I can still turn around and watch TV.  Oh, stop it.  Nick, what's going on?  What's up?  I don't know if you guys remember back in, like, the late 80s where Ron McLennan, the Canucks, got, like, his throat slashed, making a save. 
[02:14:00]  That was a sick one.  There was a bar truck.  Yeah.  Blood everywhere.  Yeah, you got your facts all wrong.  But, yeah, he almost bled to death.  Yeah, the throat slashing.  End goal.  And one more thing.  Fleury got thrown out of the San Jose game.  And then after that, he beat up the mascot, Sharky, and broke one of his ribs.  You guys are mad, man.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Later.  Bye.  Are there any players in the stands, going into the stands?  There was a fight in the garden when the Bruins went into the stands. 
[02:14:30]  Mike Mulberry hitting him out of his shoe.  Yeah.  Is that on that tape?  Yeah.  Great.  Maybe I'll see that someday.  Wish you could see that, huh?  Maybe someday.  Tomorrow, eh?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Maybe somebody can make up a tape for you called Greatest Baseball Arguments.  I'm going to get it tomorrow.  Great.  You're going to make me give you one of the...  I'll be up, like, Christmas evening, trying to go to sleep, but all excited.  Excited that tomorrow's coming.  Tomorrow.  Well, make sure you leave me a plate of cookies on my desk.  Yeah.  Oh.  And you'll have a tape waiting for you in the morning. 
[02:15:00]  Opie, how about this?  How about if we ask him one or two hockey questions?  And if he gets them right...  No, no.  Wrong, wrong.  I get them wrong.  I know it.  There.  I'm wrong.  Yeah.  Ant doesn't really care that much about hockey.  I'm a big hockey guy.  I just like hockey fights.  Ant?  Jeez.  This is all I have to say to you?  All right.  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Hey, man.  Can I borrow that Hockey Fight tape?  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own. 
[02:15:30]  At least I made you laugh.  That's funny.  Okay.  Well...  All right.  A quick break, and we'll talk about Muhammad Ali next.  Ah, there you go.  Thank you, Doug.  No problem.  See, someone does like me.  There you go.  He really, really likes me.  Thank you.  One gift that will not meet the sledgehammer.  And you don't want to be my friend or anything.  Yeah, you just kind of did it, right?  Yep.  See?  One hockey fan to another.  Being though you are an Islander fan, and I couldn't...  Well, we'll leave Ranger and Islanders.  I'm just having a good year.  You've got to admit that. 
[02:16:00]  Not bad.  Okay.  We'll be back.  Hello.  This is Mick Foley, the most disgusting, ruthless wrestler in WWF history, and a respected, beloved  children's author.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Have a nice day.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What happened to the six o'clock queef today, Anthony?  Oh, my God.  No ladies called up.  None whatsoever. 
[02:16:30]  We're not even supposed to have to get on the air and solicit that.  Girls are supposed to call up for that one.  Oh, now look.  It's a little after six, and we have no girl for the queef.  Also, we're trying to figure out what Norton likes to do when he's not doing a radio show  or stand-up comedy.  Yeah.  There's nothing there.  Nothing.  He doesn't enjoy anything.  Stinky says that he knows a lot about football and baseball. 
[02:17:00]  Stinky also told me that you're a Cowboys fan.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  I have been since childhood.  I don't know why.  I just found a picture of myself when I was 11 or 12 with my little Roger Staubach jersey.  Oof.  Always a fan of the Cowboys.  How could you tell it was a Staubach jersey with your uncle on top of it?  It smells like number 12.  You know a lot about football?  You know, compared to someone, probably yes, and compared to some people, no. 
[02:17:30]  Who's winning it all this year?  I don't know.  I wouldn't mind seeing the Steelers.  And I hated the Steelers in the 70s, but they haven't won in so long.  Why not?  A great rivalry between the Steelers and Dallas.  Not really.  After the 70s, it was done.  Brad Chaw should get throat cancer.  He stinks on Fox.  They're all awful.  Hey, how are you?  Howie, a bunch of guys laughing and having fun.  Stop trying to be funny on the sports shows.  Wow.  That sucks.  Well, everyone's doing it now, though.  Everyone's doing it.  Exactly.  Nobody wants to laugh at halftime.  Got out the funny sports guy. 
[02:18:00]  It's never funny.  Hey, they're down by 15.  Remember you did that, Chris?  Ha, ha, ha.  They're all laughing.  Yeah, but you dropped the pass, Howie.  Whoa, hey.  Drop dead.  You're not funny guys.  I'm so sick of that boys' club nonsense.  Just tell me what the score is.  Who's hurt and what's happening in the second half.  That's so funny.  You dropped the pass.  Oh, ho.  You know what I'm talking about, though?  Oh, J.B.  They're always sort of,  Flippin' player.  Settle down over there, guys.  Boy, J.B. 
[02:18:30]  Howie, Chris.  Oh, ho, ho.  What, you guys just having fun, you know?  Schmucks.  I'm just happy to find out that you watch TV.  I know.  That's kind of nice.  I feel good now.  I feel better.  I like TV, man.  It's just that the shows are so bad.  What do you think of the Jets?  With the field goal and stuff.  I hate the Jets, although I give Hall a lot.  That's an amazing thing.  53-yard field goal is amazing.  Testaverde did everything he could to throw it to a Raider.  I know.  Everything he could.  Yeah, right.  You're so right, man.  But Hall, 53 yards under pressure. 
[02:19:00]  You've got to respect.  De La Uso should have his foot beaten with a rock.  That choking bum.  Wow.  That bum.  And what about Michael Strahan?  Setting the record from Gastineau.  With Brett Favre falling down.  Oh, that last play?  Falling down so he could get the record pretty much.  Yeah, who cared about that?  He just kind of...  Whispering what play he was going to run just before he ran it, too, by the way.  Yeah, just tumbling.  Oh, a little fall there.  Tackle me.  Come on.  I'm going to run your way, and I'm going to fall down in front of you.  That was not a sack.  I would not want the record. 
[02:19:30]  No.  No.  Sack is something that should really almost paralyze a quarterback.  You know, some Leon Lett character coked up running through and just clotheslining you  until they pick your white ass up off the turf.  That's what I like.  Or a nice leg-shattering snap.  Joe Theismann.  That's always lovely to see.  That's great.  Here's the weight of LT on...  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  That's a sack.  I hate Theismann because he's a cowboy hater. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  Relax.  He isn't a bugger.  Hey, hey.  Settle down.  Sorry, folks.  Didn't mean to get my feathers all in a bunch.  Sometimes I get a bee in my barn at open ant.  You know how it is.  But it is nice to see that you do occasionally take up some technology.  I can't even watch football.  The greatest rage I've ever had has come from Dallas losses.  When Leon Lett slid on Thanksgiving...  Remember that?  Yeah, I remember it.  And he kicked the ball into the end zone. 
[02:20:30]  I'm not kidding.  I was living with Mommy and Daddy.  I almost threw a chair through my parents' bay window.  I punched a hole through my door and threw a slipper.  Because I'm like, that won't break anything.  A little anger there.  Yeah, it's called being immature and spoiled until I was seven.  And this girl I just started dating is like, I got to go.  At seven?  You started dating at seven?  No, no, no.  I'm saying that I was an only child until seven.  Oh, okay.  I was like, okay.  You started to date at seven.  And then your sister came along and you've been bitter ever since?  No, no.  Yeah, Tracy was born when I was seven.  Oh, so you were spoiled up until that point. 
[02:21:00]  And then you were just second...  Why do I have to share everything now?  Yeah, a little second banana, nothing with fat, meaty bosoms.  That's your sister, yo.  Not her, me.  Oh.  My sister's actually...  The rest of my family is nice.  Yeah?  My parents are nice people.  My sister's a nice, normal girl.  My nephew's a fine young fella.  Do they go to see your act or anything?  They do, yes.  And what do they think of you on stage?  They enjoy it.  They're happy I'm not doing drugs anymore.  I mean, you know, the fact that I'm... 
[02:21:30]  All right, he's up there doing little potty jokes.  Do they enjoy the baby joke?  They've never seen that one.  I edit a little when they're there.  Oh, you know, change that punchline again.  Right, I got you.  My mother and father, man.  I got to be a little bit normal, you know.  I'm still a dirtbag.  Yes.  What's up?  I would just like to say that hockey is cool and not just for the fights.  It's a very awesome game.  I still love it.  I just miss the really good fights.  Yeah, and I was wondering why y'all never have...  Like, y'all barely ever have girls call in. 
[02:22:00]  We've had a lot of women call in a lot.  Oh, no, no, really, y'all don't.  No?  No.  Y'all always have guys, and that's a little weird, because y'all are guys.  How do you spell y'all?  Y'all are guys.  Y'all.  Y apostrophe A-L-L.  Yeah.  Y'all.  I'm from Louisiana.  Hey, could y'all play Praise by Seven Dust for me?  That's a great song, but we've got to talk a little more.  We're taking song requests now?  Yes.  You'll have to. 
[02:22:30]  Wait a minute.  Do you listen to the show a lot?  Yeah, a little.  I just started.  You just started.  Yeah.  Well, please tell your friends, because we could use the help.  Oh, well.  All right.  Yeah, Emily, you do sound real sexy.  I'm only 18.  Yeah, that's even better.  Be careful.  That kills the fantasy.  That's even sexier.  That's in the range.  That's in the range.  18's legal.  Down the south, you're ready to retire at 18.  And I go to a Catholic school.  You ever listen to a full O&A show? 
[02:23:00]  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, thanks.  But every time I listen, y'all have guys on.  Well, that should be happy for you, right?  Oh, yeah.  What do you look like, Emily?  What, like how tall I am?  Yeah, yeah.  How tall?  I'm 5'1", and I weigh 96 pounds.  I have blue eyes, brown hair.  You ever hear a couple of crispy hundreds being placed in your hand, have you?  No.  I'm willing to pay for the young stuff. 
[02:23:30]  There you go.  Oh, wow.  I'm from Louisiana.  No, I mean...  What kind of figure do you have there?  Where is she from?  What kind of figure in 2002 you have?  Figure.  Figure.  Where is she from?  How's your figure?  Yeah, I ask a lot of questions.  Well, yeah.  Do you have big boobs?  What?  Do you have the big boobies?  Um, a 34C.  All right.  The C.  That's pretty nice.  What color are you? 
[02:24:00]  Areola?  That's what?  I'm telling you, I'm the biggest pig, but I defend women.  A lot of women don't know how sexy they really are.  Do you got the rivets, or do you got the slow fade, the Hershey Kisses?  What do you got?  I'm not answering any of those questions.  You got those gravy stains?  All sloppy.  I like that.  Do you know now why y'all don't get a lot of girls calling the show?  Yeah, I can see now.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Emily.  Okay.  All right.  There she goes.  We're going to play some Seven Dust for Emily in a little bit here. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, sure.  Sean, what's going on?  We got it right on for you.  Yeah.  Sean.  I wanted to ask Norton if you remember the Super Bowl where Jackie Smith dropped a touchdown  pass in the end zone?  Yeah, Pittsburgh beat them 35-31.  Listen to him.  I threw a coffee mug through my 25-inch color TV.  I was 13.  I was 13.  I had to work the whole summer to pay for the TV.  My father kicked the crap out of me.  Yeah, he was actually a good tight end, too.  There was no reason.  He was good with St. Louis.  He was good.  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  He sucked up the joint when he joined the Cowboys.  Yeah, I'll never forget that.  I think Randy White had a cast on his arm, too, and fumbled towards the end of the game.  I know Brad just sat on the ball.  I'm just excited.  Norton knows something.  He knows a lot about this.  Listen.  Jackie Smith.  A-push-ha!  A-push-ha!  A-push-ha!  A-push-ha!  A-push-ha!  A-push-ha!  Yeah, we really got hurt that year.  79, that was.  All right.  I don't know if Rick's going to be done with the Muhammad Ali thing.  He's got to be.  This was like our game for today.  We haven't seen him all day.  Where is he? 
[02:25:30]  Let's get him in here.  See where he's at.  We need a progress report from Rick.  He's watching various shows with man's yam bags in it, are you, Rick?  No.  What are we doing?  Working on the Muhammad Ali thing.  Very tough.  What do you mean?  It's tough.  He's a little more discernible than King Gimp.  Oh, okay.  I was going to say, well, of course, King Gimp was impossible.  Let me see.  I got one, two, three.  You want to start with the first four or something? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, let's give it a try.  All right.  Let's give it a try.  We'll see if it's easier.  Whatever.  Rick doesn't seem too confident about this.  No.  You're not very confident.  Are you?  Doesn't this kid look like Curious George?  That kid that crashed the plane into the building?  Thank God.  Thank God no one was hurt except him.  We don't have to worry about him getting a little older and getting a little more resourceful.  Although, that's pretty resourceful.  And he's not a terrorist.  He's just a little brat.  Dope.  Dopey kid.  Looking for attention. 
[02:26:30]  Just be like other kids your age.  You want attention?  You pick up a gun and you shoot your classmates.  You don't have to fly a plane.  You know, try to be different.  Just open fire in school because they called you a nerd.  He does look like he was beat up every day.  Oh.  Every day.  Awful face.  Up in a plane, though.  Flew that plane into a building.  Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, Morton, do you want to buy your underwear at Kmart and, like, watch Wapner at 1 p.m.?  You're like Rain Man with these scores. 
[02:27:00]  No, you know what?  I really am not.  I just, for the Cowboys, I know a lot about Dallas, especially the awful moments.  Definitely kid-toucher.  Definitely kid-toucher.  Definitely kid-toucher.  This one is 46.  All right, Andrew.  Have a good one.  Take care, man.  Well, no 6 o'clock week today, Anthony.  I know.  Look at that.  Oh, maybe the gal from Louisiana would have done it.  It's 6.15 now.  A little southern twang to it.  We have to do things when we're saying we're going to do the things.  Yeah.  Right?  Something like that. 
[02:27:30]  Something like that.  Hey, Jim, how did you lose your virginity?  Girl, I was dating.  I was actually, I've been sexually.  Hold on, hold on.  Probably not.  All right, because I forgot.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's just back up.  You've been active since second grade?  Yeah, no exaggeration.  Second grade.  Because I remember a girl, I'll be very, I'll be very gentle.  This is going all the way in second grade.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Okay.  What do you get in second grade?  You just kiss around certain areas because a girl will show you, and that's when I learned 
[02:28:00]  I love the backside.  And certain little yellow things that I like, I learned at a young age.  My first time I actually went all the way, I was 18, I was dating a girl, and I was drunk,  and I used to wear hats because I hated my hair.  I almost got thrown out of high school for wearing hats.  Yeah?  What kind of hats did you wear that you all got thrown out of high school?  Baseball, anything to cover my hair.  God, you've got to find pictures.  I got some.  Bring in the pictures of you with the hats on to cover your bad hair. 
[02:28:30]  I don't have a hat picture, but I have the bad cowlick.  I was such a queer dork in high school.  I mean, not that I'm a hot number now, I'm still like a five, but I was like a one and  a half when I was 16.  You know, that's odd that you brought up with the second grade, because I, in kindergarten,  there was a girl down the street, and I used to knock on the door and ask if she could  come out and play, and we'd go back in her shed, and she would show me her ass.  She would just pull her pants down and show me her ass, and I would stand there and look  at her ass, and she'd, like, she'd give the kindergarten version of the fisheye. 
[02:29:00]  Like, she'd turn around and look at me looking at her ass.  Like baby Archie's.  Baby stripper giving you the fisheye.  Baby Archie's.  I loved it.  I loved the hiney at that age.  Because I remember putting, this is true, you put your face against the cheek and it  was cool.  The skin was cool.  I loved that.  Yeah, not being a perv either.  That's what I remember.  Not being a perv, but.  No, but I was young.  I didn't.  I was afraid to show my thing. 
[02:29:30]  Right.  She wants to be mine.  I was like a boy.  I was like, no.  You know, I didn't know.  No, no.  That embarrassment's safe for later.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So how'd you lose your virginity, then?  With the bed, hats, drunk?  I had a hat on while I was having sex.  I was such a nerd.  Wow.  And I was drunk.  I was kind of in a blackout, so I really don't remember it.  My actual sexual blackout.  You're going to give some of the details?  I would love to.  I was awful.  I stink now, and I'm doing it for 30 years.  Was it a hooker?  You didn't have a big back, did she?  No, she didn't.  What do you have to tuck, honey?  What? 
[02:30:00]  What's with this duct tape, I'm feeling?  I still just basically...  Was it a hooker?  Was it a gig?  No, no, no, no, no.  I didn't get...  My first hooker, I was 19.  Oh.  No, I was already a non-virgin.  No, this was a girl I was dating, who I have not seen in well.  Where did it go down?  At her house?  In my room, where I lived, at my parents' house.  In my room.  And your parents were what?  Sleeping next door?  Out, maybe?  Yeah, they were around somewhere, but I didn't...  It was nothing eventful.  I wish I had a great eventful story to tell you.  But like anything else, once a girl decides to give it to me, I'm horrible. 
[02:30:30]  I jam.  I don't...  Because it's your problem.  I jam.  Holy cow.  That'll get the female demos up.  I jam.  I'm not even knocking women.  That is hysterical.  The bottom line is, if I get any girl pregnant, the first thing she's going to do is look  for steps to throw herself down.  I'm not going to have to do anything about it.  Oh, my God.  I have blubbery bosoms and thin lips.  You're such a mess. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  Well, at least he's honest, Anne.  How are we?  Okay.  And we all know how Anne lost his virginity with...  Oh, that was...  With Buzz.  Years ago.  Buzz in California.  Yeah.  Some broad.  Anne's dad set him up with his first.  Yeah.  Good boy.  13th birthday.  Kind of like that James at 15 show.  That was great.  Yeah.  How old?  13?  13th birthday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.  Okay.  We're leaving.  Girl.  Neighborhood girl.  19. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  She was over the house.  That was it.  Goes, oh, hop in the shower.  I was like, okay, hop in the shower.  Go to...  Come back downstairs and I hear from the bedroom, you're coming in?  Like, what is this?  Why is she in the...  I, oh, okay.  It was like, boom, and it just hits you.  Like, oh, here it is.  All right.  Buckle down, because here it comes.  And that was it.  Walked in.  Use a bag or no?  She's sitting there.  Please.  Please. 
[02:32:00]  Good boy.  Good boy.  Are you kidding?  Good boy.  Good boy.  Forget it.  13.  What the hell do I know?  Absolutely.  I didn't use the one with my hand.  Why should I use it with anything else?  She had the sheets.  She had the sheets, yeah.  Pulled up when I walked in the bedroom.  Pulled up just under her bosom.  Ooh.  So these big cans are hanging over the sheets, and it was like the first live ones I saw.  It's like, oh, my goodness.  Look at that.  Look at those treats.  I dove on.  That's about it. 
[02:32:30]  I was fantastic.  I was in college.  Geneseo.  Yeah.  College.  College.  Onondaga dorm.  A dorm?  What?  Dorm room.  Was it a sorority girl?  No.  No, you know the story, because you made fun of me.  It's the hairy girl.  Oh, the hairy girl.  The hair down her back.  Ah.  Uneventful.  Very good looking girl.  Until you turned her over, and she had a tail.  Like a, like her.  I'm mean.  No joke.  Not just little, like, peach fuzz. 
[02:33:00]  Dark hair that went from here all the way down to the tailbone.  Did she have it under the arms?  Huh?  No, she just had it down to her ass.  It was some weird birth defect.  Down to her ass.  No, it was like, it was like an inch wide, and it went from, no joke, back of her neck,  all the way down to her tailbone.  Dark.  How sick is that?  Dark.  Like a mingon on a horse.  Dark.  Dark. 
[02:33:30]  I, is this, you ever hit one with the little hair under the pits?  I've never done that.  No, I.  I would.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't surprise me.  Not the legs, though.  The legs have to be shaved.  You're into axillism?  What's that mean?  Having sex with a, uh.  An armpit.  That's hairy.  No.  No.  It's called axillism.  No, I certainly didn't know that.  Are you into acculinctus?  Accu?  Acculinctus.  I'm going to say, I think that has some.  Having your eyeballs licked. 
[02:34:00]  No.  And they turn you on.  No.  Sick.  No.  So many better ways of spreading disease than that.  Believe me, as far as I go is, I have to use the bathroom.  Nah, why get up?  That's as weird as I get.  Right.  And I've liked that.  And everyone that hits me on the instant messages at home, you know, do you really like that?  Yes.  I'm not making it up to be wacky.  I do.  I've liked it since childhood.  And I used to ask Julie, can you say this?  Like, say you have your head on the ground and, you know, and someone has their pants on 
[02:34:30]  and maybe they've had a little mistake.  Uh-huh.  You say, go ahead.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Since, uh, and she was probably in third grade, I was in second, or third and fourth.  So she would, uh, uh, relieve herself.  No, no, no.  Not, but, yeah, but not on me.  Right, right, right.  Uh, uh, but, but her pants would end up wet.  Yes.  With this, uh, product.  And then you would then put this over your face?  Breathe it in like it was Vicks and I had a stuffy nose.  That is really odd for a third grader. 
[02:35:00]  Absolutely true.  Vito.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, Vito.  Hey, what's up, man?  I thought you lost your vagina to that fat chick on a horseback.  No, Dreamweaver, no.  No Wrangler?  I met her on the CB, on the CB radio.  Uh, so that wasn't a one?  No, I just, I, she, she sounded all hot and everything and we made a date and I, I took,  uh, one of the other horses.  I was on a horse and I led one of the other horses to meet her. 
[02:35:30]  And when I met her, she was as big as one of the horses.  So we just rode around for like an hour and a half, two hours and I was like, oh, I gotta go.  And that was the end of Dreamweaver.  I'm glad you clarified that.  No, it wasn't Dreamweaver.  Hey, tell them to keep his chin up and turn it around.  All right.  Thank you, Vito.  All right, boys.  Bye.  Turn it around.  Should we ask Ben and Rick how they lost their virginity or?  Ben, any good stories?  Not really.  How old were you?  How old were you?  Yes.  15 or 16?  16.  16 and what happened?  What happened? 
[02:36:00]  What do you think happened?  Squish, squish.  Oh, Jesus.  Nice.  Stroke something.  Did that happen?  He just spilled it all over.  He got excited and it got wet all over the place.  Wow, look at that.  Over there in the corner.  Real quick, too.  Yeah, nice and fast.  Remember we went through it the day?  Remember a long time ago we went through what song was playing everyone?  Remember the only one that claims he couldn't remember around here?  Mm-hmm.  Remember we talked about, everybody, we talked about what song was playing? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  When I lost it.  You know what song was playing when you lost your virginity?  Believe me, I don't think there was any music.  Me, it's an embarrassment.  It was Abacab over and over again.  Old turntable where the record would just go back to the beginning.  You know what I mean?  If you had the arm down or whatever, right?  Yeah.  And then it just kept playing like the first side of Abacab by Genesis over and over again.  I didn't have any music at all.  It should have been taps.  It should have been taps.  It has no music.  Oh, and Earl couldn't remember the song.  Earl, I can't remember. 
[02:37:00]  I don't know.  It hasn't been written yet.  Get Earl in here.  He won't have a story about how he lost his virginity.  We should remember the story he told us last time, see if it matches up.  That's what we should have done.  It was some girl.  The man in the yellow hat set me up with her.  Yellow hat.  And Rick, did you have a good story?  I was about 14.  It's in the woods.  It's in the woods.  See, all the stories are uneventful.  That's why...  And it was a heavy chick with pointy boobies. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, God.  That's a flatso.  It's a flatso, right?  No, because they were...  Those heavy chicks don't usually have pointy ones.  They just weren't fully developed just yet.  But they were there.  She was going to have guns.  Oh, is that it?  She was going to have guns.  Yeah, but I got them way too early.  But they were triangles.  They were ripe.  Still green bananas.  Did she run her fingers through your Ronald Reagan hairdo?  Hello.  I didn't have a Ronald Reagan hairdo. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  Damn.  Well, we're getting at something here.  Very uneventful stories, really, for the most part, right?  We want to have a little contest.  Ooh.  We want to find a girl that wants to lose her virginity on our show.  Yes.  Seriously.  And we also want to find a guy that wants to lose his virginity on our show.  And they don't necessarily have to do it with each other.  No.  I take care of both.  It's not that.  Oh, God.  There's a girl out there, and she wants to lose her virginity, and if we can supply the guy, that's cool. 
[02:38:30]  If not, you have one that you have in mind.  I'm thinking anything goes for this.  If there's a girl, and you're a virgin, and you're thinking of losing your virginity,  we will go to great lengths to do exactly what you want.  If you have a boyfriend, you want to lose it with him, that's fine.  You pick the place, the atmosphere.  If you want to lose it, up in the sky, in a plane, we will make that happen.  Whatever it is. 
[02:39:00]  In a hotel suite, we'll make that happen.  In an old Chevy truck under a bridge, we'll make it happen.  In a place in Cliffside Park.  Whatever it takes.  In the middle of the woods, with poison ivy, whatever floats your boat.  Whatever you want.  And as far as the significant other is concerned, it could be someone of your choosing,  someone maybe that you've thought about it, doing it with, but you're waiting for the right time.  And then if you decide this is the right time, and you want to do it in a fun way,  a way that, you know, will be very memorable, you just pick it. 
[02:39:30]  Come up with the idea.  We'll make it happen.  You will lose your virginity on this program the way you want to.  No, we won't be watching.  No, we won't be recording.  Now, you may ask, oh, man, how do you know that the girl is a virgin?  Uh-huh.  We will F you, and we will find out.  No, stop it.  I'm kidding, of course.  Um, I do believe a very professional doctor will be involved.  A gynecologist.  Yes. 
[02:40:00]  We will get a gynecologist.  To give their expert opinion.  Give their opinion.  Now, I know in some instances, it's very hard to tell if a girl is still a virgin or not,  because tampons, things like that.  Yeah.  Or even, you know, if the girls are doing things to themselves in certain instances.  Anything.  Right.  And, uh, these things, uh, taken into consideration, the doctor will give his best judgment.  That's right.  In some cases, it might be, uh...  It's not going to be pulling the wool over our eyes. 
[02:40:30]  Ho-ho.  Ho-ho.  In some cases, the girl, it might be, uh, look like a little, uh, snare drum.  Who knows?  Might be completely, uh, intact.  That's right.  Ding, ding, ding.  But, we will make things, uh, just like you like them.  That's right.  That's right.  So, contest is on.  Contest on.  Ladies.  Gentlemen.  Well...  The guys, I know what's going to happen. 
[02:41:00]  It's more important that we get the ladies involved first.  Right.  And maybe we can open it up for the guys.  That's it.  Thank you.  Great idea.  Until we get a girl, no guys.  That's right.  Because I know it.  Dude, hook me up.  Yeah.  That's what we're going to get.  20,000 guys going to hook me up.  But there may be a guy out there with a pretty interesting story.  Maybe some weird 35-year-old or something.  Well, whatever.  How old are you, Earl?  Ben loves it.  What happened, Earl?  I'm just asking your age. 
[02:41:30]  Earl, what happened when you lost your virginity?  I was in the conference room.  Oh, he's kind of remembering.  Here?  The old NEW Studios.  The old NEW Studios.  He says he did it.  Look at him knocking back the water.  He's mad as he tells me.  He's in the conference room.  I'm not proud of it at all.  Let me just take a little time.  Not proud of it.  That's all I'm going to say about it.  Is she a patty?  That's all you have to say.  Was she black, white, yellow?  White chick?  Yes.  A white chick.  Oh, I think the last time you said she wasn't.  Damn, going against the race.  I didn't say anything. 
[02:42:00]  How could your first, as a proud black man, how could your first girl be a white woman?  Hey, I'm pathetic.  You've got to take what you can get.  Oh.  You have a white woman?  Wait, what are you talking about?  Yeah.  It would be a lot easier, I think, to get a black chick for a black guy.  You just made fun of me a cracker.  Yeah.  What's up with that?  You're pathetic.  You've got to get what you want.  I don't get it.  Well, on a conference table at the old studio.  No, it was just like couches in the old conference room.  Yeah.  It was the table.  It was the old N-E-W-A-M conference room. 
[02:42:30]  I thought it was the conference room table.  I never said that.  No.  Why are you getting mad, Earl?  On a couch.  I'm getting mad.  Tell us a little bit about her.  I'm not saying anything.  How did it happen?  How did it happen?  I'm not saying anything.  I just want to know.  Now, you told us previously that she had been an employee of some sort.  Not at all.  Well, now she's not an employee.  She was just a friend that you had brought to the studio. 
[02:43:00]  No, I'm just not.  I'm not saying anything else.  She was an alien being from Venus.  No, I'm just.  That's all I'm telling you.  How was she, Earl?  How was it?  It was great.  It was enjoyable.  It was great.  Quick, huh?  Do you wear a bag?  No.  Norton's question.  Good boy.  You wear a bag?  Good boy.  I love that.  No, nothing.  Good boy.  Take it.  Nothing.  Good luck.  That's all you can tell us about her?  That's all I'm going to say.  Why?  Not proud of it.  How do you think she feels? 
[02:43:30]  Earl's a virgin.  I'm telling you.  I think so, too.  Thank you, Earl.  Yeah.  How long to get the mace out of your eyes?  No, huh?  Okay, I'll give her that.  Barbara, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing?  I'll tell you, I love you guys.  I think you're great.  But really, you're trying to get a virgin on this show?  Why not?  Why not?  Oh, Mike.  I think you're pushing this just a little bit too far.  What's the problem? 
[02:44:00]  If a girl wants to lose her virginity and do it on this show, it wouldn't actually be on the show.  You're not going to, we're not going to record it or anything.  Well, we're going to do whatever we can.  Right.  We'll do as much as we can.  I'm sure you'll do everything you can.  But you know, this could be traumatic for a young girl.  No, no, no.  Oh, no.  Somehow I think you'll manage to make it traumatic for a young girl.  Well, we'll be very respectful.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I really don't understand how we can be sensitive in this area. 
[02:44:30]  Huh?  I don't understand how you can be sensitive in this area.  You're asking a young girl.  You have to have confidence in your pals, Opie and Anthony.  We didn't say a young girl.  Maybe it's going to be a 25-year-old girl that didn't get around to lose her virginity for whatever reason.  Maybe someone in their 30s.  What about Stalker Patty?  No, she is not going to be in this contest.  Hell, effing no.  If it was up to us, it would be a young lady. 
[02:45:00]  I'm sure it would be.  A very good-looking young lady.  I'm sure it would be.  But we'll take what we can get.  Well, I'll keep a close ear to make sure that you guys do the right thing.  And it's up to her how she wants to lose it.  Yep.  If you can prove, well, we'll help her prove that she's a virgin.  Oh, my God.  Well, we're going to have doctors and stuff.  We won't be there for the examination unless...  Let me just ask you this.  Unless she wants us there.  Do you realize that if a young girl hasn't had sex yet, she will not have already had an appointment with a gynecologist? 
[02:45:30]  That's enough to scare the living daylights out of you to begin with.  No, that's not true.  A female gynecologist.  Oh, that's gross.  Of course.  No, a lot of female gynos.  Too many OB.  You've got to have confidence in your pals Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  You watch how we pull this one off.  I will have confidence.  And I will keep listening.  And I'll call you back if I think you stepped over the line.  All right.  Okay.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  I don't know if we can start taking the calls from the ladies, Anthony.  They're calling in already. 
[02:46:00]  Contest is on.  You want to lose your virginity on the OB and Anthony show?  You've got to give us a call.  What do you win?  You win like...  You win.  You win by winning.  Right.  I don't know.  If they pick something cool, they win that way.  They want to do it in Atlantic City in a suite.  Okay.  They want to do it in a plane.  All right.  You know.  That's cool.  Whatever.  Right.  How about they want to do it after a month in Hawaii?  Oh. 
[02:46:30]  Within reason.  Yeah.  Within reason.  It's got to be...  You know, we'll set it up.  As romantic as they want it.  That's right.  That's it.  Come on, girls.  You'll love it.  If you're a little scared, just give us a call.  And then, you know, you can feel us out.  Yeah.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  We'll take a break, Ed.  There's a few girls that have called in already.  We'll talk to them next.  I don't think we have time for the Muhammad Ali game.  Oh, damn.  Well, it gives time.  You don't have to wait.  Rick's not...  We were going to go to the Muhammad Ali game, but I just saw it in Rick's face. 
[02:47:00]  He's not happy with...  I'm not happy with it.  Oh, boy.  But then again, that could be just me.  I'm overanalyzing.  Maybe.  Could be.  We'll listen to it.  Do you want to do a quick one just to see?  Like one question?  You want to do one?  All right.  We'll do one after the break to see if it will pan out.  All right?  Hey, is the Thomas Hunter and Michael Koston fight on the hockey fight tape?  All right.  Everyone in Boston knows who they are. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  It's the guy that killed the other father.  Come on.  That's a good fight on tape.  It's awful.  All right.  If you're a virgin and you want to lose your virginity on our show, yes, ladies, give us a call.  Hi.  We're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two a-holes.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony.  And E-W.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  For a few minutes, anyway.  And we've got to step aside for Ron and Fez here in New York.  Go ahead. 
[02:48:00]  The ladies are already calling for our virgin contest, Anthony.  Ah, fantastic.  This is our cute Valentine's Day promotion.  Lose your virginity live on the Opie and Anthony show.  There it is.  I think it's great for Valentine's Day.  You got one on the instant feedback?  Yeah.  If they're for real, they've got to leave a phone number or something so we can talk to them.  Yeah, she didn't give a name, but she said she's thinking of losing her virginity with her boyfriend.  But wants to know if she has to use their real names. 
[02:48:30]  She doesn't want her family to know.  No, you don't have to use your real names.  You can be Cheech and Chong for all I care.  We don't care.  Frick and Frack.  Frick and Frack, sure.  But there were no names.  Fan and Jerry.  Hubla, hubla.  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  X and Y.  It doesn't matter.  Oral and Hardy.  Carolyn. 
[02:49:00]  Yes.  Or is it Caroline, Brian?  It's Carolyn.  Hey, Carolyn.  What's up?  Carolyn.  I hate your name, by the way.  I'm sorry.  Because I've got a Carolyn and a Caroline in my family and I screwed up every single effing time.  How are you all?  How are you guys tonight?  All right.  You're a virgin?  Yes, I am.  Oh, yeah?  Turns 18 January 15th.  Oh, my God.  This is perfect.  So, why don't you tell everyone how old you are right now?  I am 17 years old.  17. 
[02:49:30]  17!  She's only 17!  So, this interests you, right?  Your pals, Opie and Anthony, helping you lose your virginity.  Yes.  My dad's going to flip, but I don't care.  Hey, hey, don't bring him into this.  Tell us a little something about yourself.  And can we do this tomorrow before someone shuts us down?  Um, I am 17 years old.  Who needs to plan?  We can get a Chevy tomorrow.  All right, go ahead.  17 years old.  I work at Duffy's Pet Center in Wayne. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Wait, you're giving a little too much info now.  Oh, my God.  Now you're going to lose your virginity on the way to your car in the parking lot today.  Oh, God.  Um, yeah.  I go to alternative high school.  What is that?  Oh, you're a troublemaker.  Well, not really.  Yeah, alternative high school.  I caught smoking dope in high school.  I had to go to one of those in California.  Well, I'm actually, I'm not a druggie.  It's just I got in a lot of fights.  Fights?  Yeah.  Tough shit.  We like that.  Why are you fighting?  We like the anger.  Because people are idiots.  Well, I know that. 
[02:50:30]  I say that all the time.  Very good.  What are you fighting for?  And you've decided that you were going to remain a virgin until when?  You found the right guy?  Until I have a chance and I have the right guy.  Do you have the right guy?  No, unfortunately I don't.  Uh-oh.  Tell me you want us to find you a guy.  I want you guys to find me a guy.  Oh, wow.  Like, what are you looking for?  Um, kind of, not skinny.  I know that.  I don't like skinny guys.  Not skinny. 
[02:51:00]  Not skinny.  Um.  But not fat?  Not too fat.  Like in the 180s, maybe.  180s.  Are you a pig?  Me?  Oh, my goodness.  Hey, hey, Opie.  I am.  Hold on.  Hold on, Carolyn.  Could you hold on just two seconds?  Yes, sir.  What are you, stupid?  We got one girl on the phone.  You know what?  Okay, I'm back.  Even I know I slipped that time.  Well, see, the thing is...  Here's how you do it.  All right.  Carolyn, why don't you tell us a little about yourself? 
[02:51:30]  What do you look like?  I have short, auburn hair.  I'll put my chart away, by the way.  There is a chart.  Okay, you have what?  Short?  I have short, auburn hair.  Okay.  I'm five foot six.  Five six.  I have...  You guys are not going to believe this, but the thing is, my friend...  At school, I'm known as Torpedoes.  Hey, that's a great name.  Torpedoes.  Torpedoes.  My chest size is 48 Triple D.  48 Triple D. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Holy crap.  Okay.  Are those virgins?  Can I talk to you for a second?  Sure.  All right.  You know what the 48 number means, right?  That's the fact.  48 is around the back.  Yeah, okay.  Okay.  How much does a gal like you weigh?  Unfortunately, over 200.  So what?  It's medication, though.  Medication made me gain the weight.  Of course it is.  What's it called?  The twinkie?  No, not twinkie.  No, like OCD and anxiety and stuff like that. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  That's great.  Now we got...  Now I'm thinking...  You weren't expecting a beauty, were you?  Well, you know what?  No, people tell me I'm cute.  It's just I'm overweight.  That's the only thing.  Of course.  And on the chart, that's not actually bad for that height.  If you're a bison, that's...  Oh, my God.  No.  Is that Norton?  Hold it.  Hold it.  I think you're lovely.  Look. 
[02:53:00]  Okay.  So you're over 200.  Yeah.  That's anywhere from 201 to 299.  And that's a huge difference.  Oh, isn't it?  So could you tell us a little more in the ballpark?  Around 250.  All right.  Right in the middle.  A lot of guys, to be not even making funny, a lot of guys like a girl a little bit bigger.  That's just what they go for.  I mean, it's funny.  Dude, let me tell you something.  As much as we're making fun, I guarantee it'll take me two minutes to get ten guys lined up 
[02:53:30]  that'll do it.  Of course.  And you're going to have to take a phone call.  They're right here in this studio.  How are we going to know that you're still a virgin?  Well.  Oh, Jesus.  You're still a virgin.  Yeah.  Now, why would...  Why wait?  What the hell are you saying there for?  So why have you waited so long?  Well, yeah.  I just...  It just never really, you know, occurred to me. 
[02:54:00]  It's like, hey, I'm a virgin, you know.  Why has she waited so long?  What?  Why had the medication?  She said that.  Yeah.  I waited.  All right.  Who wants to bang a whacked out fat broad?  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, you're still listening?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Have you been...  It's all right.  I've been called worse.  Let me ask you something.  Have you been institutionalized?  Oh, my God.  Can I say the Fifth Amendment?  No.  Just...  No one knows exactly. 
[02:54:30]  No one knows who you are.  Go ahead.  Girl interrupted.  Girl interrupted.  Girl interrupted.  Meet shallow Hal.  Great.  Girl interrupted.  Only not for dinner.  Okay.  So, you have been institutionalized.  Yes.  For what?  OCD.  I can't...  OCD.  I got a little soft spot for you.  Obsessive-compulsive dining?  She's got a soft spot all over.  No, obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
[02:55:00]  You know that.  I know it well, yes.  What's your problem?  You wash things over and over again?  The thoughts in your head over and over again?  No.  I'm known as a cutter.  Oh, no.  Boy, you're all over the place.  Yeah.  So, you cut yourself a razor blade.  Not anymore.  I haven't done that in two years.  Contest over.  I want to see this girl lose her virginity live on our show.  We don't need Valentine's Day.  How about Friday?  She's going to lose her mind.  15th.  It's got to be after the 15th.  She's only 17th.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What's Friday?  What?  It's only the 7th today. 
[02:55:30]  Next Tuesday.  How about for your 18th birthday?  When is that?  The 15th?  Someone do the math.  Do the math.  Do it right on your birthday?  Yeah, that'd be cool.  A week from tomorrow.  Wow, torpedoes.  And it sounds like we don't have to spend any money on you.  Screw the sweets and all that crap.  We'll put a rockaway bed in that studio next to us.  I would like a flower.  Just roll in a cheese cake and a pack of razors.  All she wants is a flower.  What, do you want a flower?  Yeah.  Jeez.  F-L-O-U-R.  You know, we're going to have to have someone check the region, right? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  The region.  Now, wait a minute, though.  I've got to ask you something.  Mm-hmm.  Have, and don't be specific.  Don't give any more info than what I'm saying here.  Okay.  Have you done other things?  Yeah.  Okay.  Have you used things?  Um, a while ago.  All right.  Well, then it wouldn't be intact, as I said.  Have you, have you given favors to guys? 
[02:56:30]  Yes.  All right.  She's a favorite.  And are you...  Friends with benefits.  Friends with benefits.  Are you a virgin, um, both front and back?  I won't do the back way.  All right.  Well, that's good.  That's good, because something tells me it's constantly in use for the other direction.  And we have run out of time with Carolyn.  Oh, what happened?  Just when we were getting to know her, but we, we, the show's over.  So we're going to start the show with you tomorrow.  Oh.  Okay.  So hold on the line so we can get your phone number and, uh, get more details for our virginity 
[02:57:00]  contest, okay?  But you're a winner, man.  You're a cutter, OCD, drug addict, fat.  Torpedoes.  Short hair on a fat girl.  Never good.  Oh.  Yeah, why didn't you grow your hair long?  It's growing now.  It's past my chin.  You didn't cut it off to see you, too, did you?  No.  All right.  I was wondering.  Man, we love you.  Okay.  Well, we shouldn't say that.  Hey, she'll be shocking us.  We like you a lot, though.  Hold on, all right?  Okay. 
[02:57:30]  All right, there she goes.  Cool.  250 pounds, 5'6".  That's not even good on the moon.  That's not even good on the moon.  Buzz Aldrin wouldn't have fat.  All right, really fast, because we've got to get the hell out of here, Anthony.  Yeah.  We'll continue the virginity contest tomorrow.  Any other ladies want to try to beat out Carolyn?  Good luck.  Good luck.  She's got a lot going on.  Hey, where'd she go?  Did we get her number?  Did you hang her for her?  No, she was there. 
[02:58:00]  Anne saw.  No, you didn't.  I saw it was red.  She didn't get pissed, because we were calling the fat.  And then it hung up.  We were just being jovial.  She's joking around.  All right, well, have her call back.  If you're listening, call back so we can get your info.  She'll call back.  She knows we really like the details and stuff.  She sounded totally good.  All right, all right.  Ben's saying we've got to leave.  Yeah, we've got to go.  We've got a trip to Royal Rumble.  Yep.  Very easy.  If you're going to Raw tonight at Madison Square Garden or SmackDown tomorrow night at the Garden,  best O&A sign we see on live TV, Wow sign, O&A, Jim Norton sign, whatever. 
[02:58:30]  The best one, our listeners will determine, we'll win the trip to see the Royal Rumble on January 20th.  We'll have more details tomorrow.  But if you're heading there now, get your signs, okay?  All right, Ben's panicking.  It's freaking.  We'll be seeing you guys tomorrow.  What's the meaning of this slacking off?  Dude, it's all in it!  Whatever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A smorgasbord of idiocy.  The greatest radio that I've ever heard. </pre>
