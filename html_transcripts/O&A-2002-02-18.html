<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with a game of "Black or White," where the hosts attempted to guess callers' races based solely on their voices.  This segment involved several callers and relied heavily on racial stereotypes, with the hosts often making accurate guesses but acknowledging some instances of misidentification. The name Keisha was mentioned as a giveaway in one instance.  The hosts debated the validity of their method, creating several uncomfortable moments due to their use of stereotypical assumptions.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the frustrating and drawn-out syndication process.  Opie and Anthony used highly offensive language to express their anger and frustration towards unnamed individuals involved in the process, describing it as "psychological torture."  A call from a new affiliate in Bangor, Maine followed, leading to a humorous, hyperbolic, and extremely offensive bit about the long wait.  They played an audio clip of a confrontation with their boss, where they were called "stupid." This led to personal anecdotes and humorous recollections of past shared experiences, including stories about their previous living situation.  The conversation then shifted to explicitly detailed discussions of sexual performance and relationships, including a callerâ€™s opinions and contributions from Opie's girlfriend who called into the show.  The discussion was highly vulgar, with numerous interruptions and explicit sexual references. Chuck, a friend, joined them in the studio during this segment.

A chaotic in-studio argument erupted between Opie and Rick, escalating into a physical altercation on the floor.  The argument involved numerous insults, references to specific sexual acts ("doggy style," "hummers," "reach around"), and accusations of steroid use.  Joey attempted to mediate unsuccessfully. The fight ended with Rick pulling down Opie's pants, leaving both visibly exhausted.

Following the fight, the show conducted a phone interview with Jonathan Harris (Dr. Smith from *Lost in Space*).  While the conversation covered Harris' career, it frequently veered into sexually suggestive and inappropriate territory, including innuendo directed at William, the young boy he worked with on the show. Callers further contributed to this inappropriate banter.

The broadcast included a news segment on an EMS worker mistakenly pronouncing a woman dead.  A humorous, highly suggestive, and vulgar bit about a figure skater nicknamed "Dice on Ice" followed, detailing his skating routine and persona.

A later segment featured an Elvis impersonator who refused to sing from the show's bathroom, a claimed tradition linked to Elvis' death.  Despite the hosts' attempts to persuade him, he remained firm in his refusal out of respect for Elvis. The CD was eventually played in the studio.

This was followed by a caller, Keith, recounting an embarrassing childhood experience of walking in on his parents having sex.  This led to a sexually explicit conversation with Keith and his mother, who called in, detailing various instances of their family's unsuccessful attempts at maintaining privacy during sex.

A segment about a radio employee, "Spaz," and his extravagant birthday spending spree at the St. Regis hotel, including excessive mini-bar charges and a personal butler, was detailed.  The hosts and callers reacted with disbelief and humorous criticism to his irresponsible spending habits and accumulating credit card debt.

The show concluded with further banter between the hosts and caller interactions, and a segment where the hosts discussed one of their relative attractiveness, making crude jokes about Star Jones' appearance and a pun referencing her perceived interest in Magic Johnson's wife.  Crude jokes about body weight and appearance, including a comparison of a woman to a "BLP" and contrasting it with "BBW," were made. The segment was interrupted by a break for food. Andrew was also mentioned as contributing to this final conversation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the OB and Anthony show. Hey, got a bunch of contestants on the line, Anthony.  We want to play black or white. See if there's any truth to this stereotypical black voice or  stereotypical white voice. Yeah, a lot of people get upset when you say you sound black on the  phone. Right. Like, well, what does that mean? Is there a stereotypical sounding black voice?  And I think we say yes. Yeah. No one would no one would mistake me for sounding black, would 
[00:00:30]  they? No, no. But our own black Earl sounds really white. Still, I could tell that he's  black. Yeah, you could tell when he starts getting angry. All right. Well, yeah. So all  right. So how are we going to play this game? We got some prizes to give away to anyone that  beats us. All right. We plunk a phone line down and then what we ask him a couple of  questions. Yeah. The deal is and I both get two questions and then we'll guess if you're  black or white. OK. OK. We can ask any questions. So that could help as well. Yeah. All right. 
[00:01:00]  Let's go to line one. No, just based on speech. You can't ask questions about anything else.  This is just based on. Hold on. Hold on. Well, then I want to ask questions.  Give it. Then it blows the whole thing. The whole thing is just based on speech.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now I'm going to bury you. Why would that blow it? If I ask this guy,  this guy, his name, why would that blow it? Because it might be a black name, Shamil or  something. Why is Shamil a black name, Anthony? It's not. It's a Jewish name. So I think if 
[00:01:30]  we're going to be fair here, we can just ask him questions. It doesn't matter. All right.  You're doing the exact same. I think it takes away from the validity of the test. Why? You're  doing the exact same thing I did a little while ago, saying that I could hear when someone  is, you know, black or white. Yeah. So what if I asked this guy's name and he said, you  know, Shamil? Yeah. Shamil. Shamil, whatever. All right. Then you would, you would think  that it's, he would probably be black. Why? Because that's a black person's name. There's 
[00:02:00]  white people named Shamil somewhere. Not many. I'm sure. Not many. It would increase the odds  that he would be black. So are we allowed to ask any questions or not? No, you could just  have them state things. I wouldn't ask questions. This is supposed to be just based on the sound  of a voice. Nothing else. All right. What the voice is saying doesn't matter. All right, let's  start. Hi, who's this? Sam. All right. All right, Sam. Sam, tell us a little bit about yourself.  I work in Deer Park. I got a joke, boy, if you want to hear that. Okay. Okay. What is Brooklyn 
[00:02:30]  and a girl in tight jeans have in common? What? Flat bush. So I'm ready to win. What's  up? All right. You got to be honest with us. I will. I told Rick. I'll answer. All right.  I'm saying this is a black gentleman. Yeah, you're right. What gave it away? I can hear it  a little bit in your voice. Okay. Very, very, uh, very slight, but I could hear it. All right. 
[00:03:00]  All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks for playing. And thanks for being honest. No  problem, bro. Because we have to take your word on this one. Okay. Let's go to a female  next. Hi, who's this? Hi. What's your name? My name. I'd rather not say my name. Oh, you're  black. That's it, huh? Yeah, you're black. Yeah. I didn't want to say it. No, I can hear  it without you saying that. Wow. I'll be jumping right on you. Without a doubt. Yeah. Where  do you work? I'm a student. A student? Yeah. Southern Puerto Rican right there. I'm just 
[00:03:30]  kidding. This is wrong. Well, we're two for two, though. What's your name? My name's  Keisha. Keisha. Now, that would have totally given it away. I know. That would have given  it away right away. Is this the little Keisha from the Cosby show? No. Rudy, where you been,  Rudy? The Cosby's been looking for you. I hope you waxed that mustache you had when you  were seven. All right, guys. Well, thanks for playing. All right. Bye-bye. All right. 
[00:04:00]  We'll move on to the next one. She sounded cute. All right. Who's this? This is Mike. Mike?  Yeah. Uh-oh. Yeah. All right. Well, no. Don't jump. Don't go jumping. You got lucky that  last time. No. You want to go to the phones and talk to our listeners about that one? I  just don't want you blurting it out and ruining it for somebody that might be a... That was a  no-brainer. All right. Uh, Mr. Guy, don't give us your name or anything. No, he said  Mike. Oh. Yeah, that's my name. Oh, come on. He's a Spanish guy. No, we're playing black 
[00:04:30]  or white, though. If you're not black or white, you got to hang up. Yeah, I know. And you're  not, uh, you're not faking your voice or anything, right? No, man. That's how I speak. Yeah,  because we don't want people, like, trying to act overly white or overly black. You're not.  You're a Hispanic. No, I'm not. Uh, what do you do for a living? Uh, I'm a security guard.  Uh-oh. What? You can't ask that. There are white security guards. I know. I know. I'm  just saying. I would be willing to say, uh, this is a black gentleman. No. No. What 
[00:05:00]  are you? I'm white, man. You're not white. Yo, I am white. I swear to God. I swear to God.  Listen to your voice. What's your nationality? German and French.  Oh, wow. Where'd you grow up? Carteret, New Jersey. Oh, man. Why do you talk like  that? Because the people I grew around with. Yeah, but don't you know it'll hinder your getting  a job? Yeah, I know. I mean, think about it. It will. An employer, look, you can say what 
[00:05:30]  you want. Rick's looking at me horrified. You can say what you want, but if you walk into  an employer and you sound like that, they are not going to hire you. They are going to hire  somebody who sounds like, uh, they can speak and carry on a conversation. I know. You  want me to join. Tell hi, guys. No, not hey, hi, guys. Hi, guys. How you doing? All right.  Well, we lost one so far. I still don't think that counts. Why? It's got that voice thing  going. Well, that's, well, we got tricked. Okay. All right. We're going to get one against 
[00:06:00]  us. Mike, we're going to give you a prize. Hold on, all right? All right, man. All right.  Let's, uh, go to this one. Line nine. Hello? Line nine. How are you? Yes, I'm fine. How  you doing? Oh, no. I'm doing well. And who's this? Uh, Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony.  How you guys doing? Bingo. Yeah. Can you tell? Uh, by that last word, I think. Yeah. I need  a little more time, though. Oh, gee. Come on. Well, now I'm confused. Yeah. Are you driving 
[00:06:30]  right now? No, I'm not. I'm sitting in my office. Uh-oh. Working. Desk job? You're sitting  by a desk? Yes, I am. Cleaning it? My little executive desk. Yeah. Are you cleaning it or  are you, uh, working at it? Oh, my feet are up on the desk. Up on the desk. Lazy. That's  right. Oh, my. No, I'm just saying. She's not working, obviously. I didn't take it the  wrong way. I didn't say anything. We didn't say what we think she is yet. When you have 
[00:07:00]  your feet on the desk, what does that mean? Lazy. That's all I'm saying. No, she could  just be relaxing because she was working very hard. It could be that you're the owner of the  place. Oh, maybe she owns the place. Okay. Don't take it the wrong way. All right. Is it  a crack house? No, it's not. All right. I'm just seeing if that's what you own. It's  a very reputable place. What kind of car you drive? Oh, no. I can't tell you all that.  Then you'll get it. You'll know. I am ready. Yeah. I'm ready to commit. Okay. We're going 
[00:07:30]  to go, uh, say it. Go ahead. Sure? Yeah. Black. You guys are good? We're good? Yes, you  are. You are a black woman. And I did not change my voice. This is my voice. Yeah.  We heard a few little inflections on, uh, the name Anthony. That one tipped Opie off. Oh,  yeah. Right. You know what Anthony did, huh? Yeah. That one word got me, but I had to listen 
[00:08:00]  a little more. We should just say, what's the opposite of uncle? If you hear aunt. Now, uh,  what's your name? My name is Colleen. Oh, how do you spell it? Really wacky? Oh, okay.  So, if I had given you my name, you would have never guessed. No. Nah. Well, thanks  for playing. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye-bye. We're, uh, three and one right now. Three  and one. All right. Line two, you're on the air. How you doing? How you doing? What's  up? Are you, uh, driving? Yeah, I am. What road? FDR. Ooh, FDR. Uh-oh. Heading uptown. Uh-oh. 
[00:08:30]  Heading uptown. He's teasing us, though. Heading uptown on the FDR. That's... Yeah. Well,  you got to talk a little. All right. Let's see. Yeah. Go through a little of your day  today. All right. I got a phone, so that's a quote. Ah, this is a white guy. We're right  on that one? A white guy? You just sounded like an idiot. Rick says we're right on that  one. Four right, one wrong so far. All right. Who's on line nine? Hello? Yeah, that's you. 
[00:09:00]  Okay. Don't tell us your name, but, um, so what are you doing? Working. Working very hard.  Hard enough. Yeah. All right. Where do you work? At a law firm. Oh, really? Law firm.  Okay. Law firm. Hmm. What are you wearing right now? A suit. A suit? Yes. A suit. Is it,  uh, multicolored? No, it's black. You wearing something around your head? No. You're wearing 
[00:09:30]  a black... I just want to know if it was, you know, black suit. What are you doing tonight?  I'm going home. Are you wearing, uh, are you wearing any rings right now? No. I don't  mean on your fingers. I mean around your neck. No. Oh, my God. Okay. What? What? She wasn't  insulted by that. That helps. Let's see. Stop. Are you driving home in a little while? No.  Taking the train? No. Uh, the police will be bringing... Excuse me? I'm sorry. I'm making  a very, uh, bad joke. How do you get home? I take an express bus. Oh. Bus. Bus. I wish 
[00:10:00]  I could hear more of her voice. I know. You've got to talk a little bit. What do you want  me to say? I don't know what to say. Either you're going to ask me questions or... How'd  you say ask? Uh-oh. Are you going to ask me questions or... Oh, that was a tip-off right  there. That's a good one right there. Okay. Okay. Can we give you a little, uh, test? Okay.  Uh, when I wake up in the morning, I brush my... Teeth. Hmm. Okay. All right. Um, when 
[00:10:30]  a woman has a child, it's called giving... Birth? Oof. Hmm. Hmm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, this  is a tough one. This is a very tough one. But I, I'm, I think I, I have an answer. Which  one are you going to say? I'm good. I want to make sure we're in agreement. Yeah, I'm  going to say that, too. Okay. Go ahead, Ann. You are a proud African woman. Yes. Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  That was a tough one. I almost got you guys. Oh, you almost, you almost asked. Almost.  The word ask. Yes. Got me. Yeah. I think. Sometimes I speak very quickly and it... You  said ax. No, I said ax. No, the second time you did, but the first time I heard it, too.  It tripped the flag right here. Me and Oof looked at each other and went, oh, oh, oh. No,  but usually I'm talking very quickly so I can sometimes trip up my words. And what's your  name? Ann-Margaret. Is it really? Yes. Ann-Marg-rock. No. That's very cool. 
[00:11:30]  Well, thanks for playing. All right. All right. Bye. Wow, Opie, we are five and one. Five  and one. We only got tripped up once by the guy with the Puerto Rican accent. Kind of  proving what I was saying earlier a little bit, Ann. Let's try another guy. I don't  think this is helping the cause, to tell you the truth, though. All right, line four,  you're on the air. Yeah, what's up? What's up? Oh, no. What's up? What's up? Ask me  anything. Are you locked up? No, not yet. No. Okay, just talk a little bit. I thought 
[00:12:00]  I heard a police radio. All right, what do you want me to say? What did you do today?  You woke up and then what? I woke up about four and came to work. Yeah? Yeah. What  do you do? Security guard. How do you get to work? Taxi cab. Oh, no. This could be a  problem. No, it's not. That says it right now. I don't know about that. You wouldn't be  able to get a cab. All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me ask this question.  You take a cab in every day? Every day. How many days have you been late to work in the  last three months? About nine. Okay, good. Wait a minute, are you going? Oh, yeah. Which 
[00:12:30]  way are you going? Write it down. Really? Yes. Yeah, I'm with Rick on this one. We're  finally split, you know, up here. We've been in agreeance the whole time. Oh, let him talk  a little more. Yeah, let him talk a little more. So, okay, you wake up, you brush your...  teeth. This guy might be messing with us, man. All right, what planet do we  reside on? Earth. This is a white guy. Shut up. All right, cracker. Hey, oh, cracker. 
[00:13:00]  You crack ass cracker. Hey, I'm from the ghetto. You're a white man. You idiot. We want people  that really want to, you know, try to trick us, man. Hey, I was working for a while. Yeah,  when you sounded normal. And then you try to be black and you sound more white than ever.  Thanks a lot, man. All right, bye. See, if he would have just said that, I'd have thought  he was black. Are we going to take that one or what? We got it, yeah. We knew he was 
[00:13:30]  white. You were teetering. I was teetering. I can't believe you. No, I was in agreement  at the end. Then it was obvious that he was trying to screw with us. Let's try another  female. Hi, who's this? This is Kim. Okay. All right. Now, play. That wouldn't be short  for Kimba. You guys are wrecking the game if you're trying to trick us. Just go along with  this, okay? Yeah. Yeah.

Sports Illustrated. Yeah. Read something out of one of those fine publications. I have to  go and get it? Well, I need to hear more of your voice. Well, ask me to repeat something.  Yes. How do you say Hoboken? Hoboken. I'll tell you where I'm teetering up. Yeah. Without 
[00:15:00]  a doubt. Yeah. Yeah. Let's take that chance. You want to? Yeah. All right. And you would  be a white woman. No. You guys are wrong. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Damn. Oh. You are a black  woman. How black are you? I'm black. I mean, I'm not dark as night, but I'm black. Oh. Wow.  Six. Six. All right. Kim, hold on a line. We're going to give you some fine prizes. All

Thank you. Terrific.  So, uh, what do you want me to say? I, I know right away. Oh, you do? Yeah. How the  heck do I know? Barry White sounding M or F-er. Uh, Barry White sounding M or F-er. Listen to those 
[00:16:00]  pipes. Yeah. Well, that's what I do for a living. What can I say? As a matter of fact,  he used to work with Black Earl. Did you? Yeah. At the old W and E W I E M. He knows  who this is. I thought this was Scotto. No, this is, no, this isn't Scotto. Is this  Roscoe? No. Who is it? Bill. Bill. Bill. Bill. Hmm. Bill. This is a tough one because  he's a radio guy. Yeah. An old radio guy. Yeah. Oh, shoot. He's going to nail us. How  many black people work for any W though? I think Black Earl was the only one. You worked 
[00:16:30]  on AM? I worked on AM. I was on the air at AM. I was on the air for five years. Wow.  This is tough. Five years means he held the job for five years. Oh, you rat dog. Oh, look,  you knew he was offended by that remark. Uh, and what do you do now? Uh, I'm a voiceover  artist. Yeah. Um, I'll, I, let me see. I'm saying, I don't know. All right. If you're 
[00:17:00]  guessing, if you're sure, I'll go with that one too. I will say you are a black man. Uh,  you're darn right. Yeah. Hey, you guys are pretty good. You know what got me? You can't  say that every black man has a deep voice like that. Even though I get accused of sounding  like James Earl Jones all the time. Right. You know what got me though? Your laugh. You  have that ha ha ha ha cola nut. You know, lemon lime seven up. Ha ha ha. You know? I'll get  you Mr. Bond. I feel you a lot of fun, man. Hey, thank you guys. Bye. Wow. That was 
[00:17:30]  a tough one because he was a radio guy. Seven right, two wrong. We'll take one more. Line  10. Who's this? Hello? Hi, who's this? Jeff. All right, Jeff, you're in your car? Yes,  I am. Uh, what type of car you got? Um, I have a Mercury Sable. Is there a key in the  ignition? Absolutely. God damn. Is it yours? That's what I was asking. Come on. I meant 
[00:18:00]  the key. What? Say that again. What kind of question is that? I just want to know if there  was a key in the ignition. That's all. Yes, there is. Okay. And, uh, where are you driving  to? I'm going home. Wait, what type of car was that again?  Mercury Sable? Ah, yeah. There you go. Mercury. The, uh, eliminated, you dropped the U on  your Mercury. I'm, I'm going to have to go black. Yeah. You're wrong. Really? Oh, you're 
[00:18:30]  right. You say, you say Mercury. Write that down as another word that we could use. Oh, that,  you know, Mercury. The closest planet to the sun is Mercury. Mercury. You know, you're,  you're cool. Let's, let's give you something too. All right. Okay. All right. Hold on the  line, man. All right. You guys rule. Hey, thank you. What are you giving him a prize for? I'm  feeling guilty about 200 years of oppression? Shut up. Look at you. He's a good guy. What the 
[00:19:00]  hell? He took my line pretty good. Is there a key in the ignition? That's terrible. Well,  Ant, eight right. Yep. Two wrong. Eight right. Two wrong. Not bad. Not bad at all. We have  a 75% rating. Should we play some more or is this, this getting boring? Yeah. Done. What?  I said that's 80%. Oh, is it? Yeah, that's 80%. That was 75. No, it's 80%. Hold on. Hold on.  Hold on. Eight out of 10, man. Oh, out of 10. I was thinking out of eight. Okay. I was 
[00:19:30]  thinking two out of eight. Two out of eight. Because we got eight right. All right. Two  out of eight would be okay. Right. Okay. Don't jump down my throat. All right. You save  yourself. My throat. All right. Let's take a break. We'll regroup and we'll be back. Stay  there. The Opie and Anthony show. Oh, it barely fits through the hole. Just squeeze it through.  Push it through. Push it through. Oh, my God. It's another kiss. That was a whopper. 
[00:20:00]  Coming soon. The return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony show.  And E.W. Well, what's up, Anthony? Hey, man. It's the O&A show. Yes, it is. It's a great  day, Anthony. Opie Rich from Jersey checking in. O&A getting syndicated is like Charles Manson  getting paroled. What an analogy that is, huh? Every time we come up to the parole board 
[00:20:30]  for syndication, we just sound like babbling idiots. Yeah. I don't need to be paroled because  I'm on the outside. You people are here on the inside. I'm on the outside already, so  I don't need to be paroled. That's how you sounded when you had to explain yourself to  the boss today. I don't understand what you're talking about because what we did was what  we did for the sake of doing what we had to do. Right. Not what we did for the sake of  what we might have done if we didn't do what we did.  Oh, screw it. Who wants to be syndicated anyway, man? What the hell is wrong with you, boy? I've had it last straw. I've called everyone I could call. I've even called your goddamn parents. 
[00:21:00]  Trying to get you boys to start. Look, we believe you're a very talented boy. I wouldn't have brought you on board if you weren't. But goddamn, you can't be doing this.  How many times do I have to say it? What time do we do? I've got to spell it out. Am I speaking for a healing? 
[00:21:30]  No. No, you're not. Okay, we kind of found out today that a month was tacked on to our sentence. Let's just put it that way.  A month! Another month. We don't even know how long we have to wait for this so-called syndication thing.  We don't even know. A month has been added on to our sentence. You know what it's like? You know what it's like?  Did you hear some of the experiences of the Iranian hostages years ago where they used to put the bag over their head 
[00:22:00]  and go, hey, you go home today. You go home today. And they'd bring them out and make them get dressed in their best suit  because they were going home. Yeah. And they'd drag them outside of their cell, let them see the car,  drive them around for a while, and drive back to the cell and go, you're not going home today.  It was like psychological warfare. That's what they're doing to us. That's what happens with us.  Syndication now. Yes, you syndicate today. No, you don't. No, you don't. 
[00:22:30]  Another month. Oh, wow. At least. At least. I don't even want to answer the phone.  I'm expecting a call from Boston. That's not going to be pretty.  What the hell are you going to do? You've got to keep your mask shut.  We're going to be like 65 and finally get syndicated.  Syndication now, OP. We'd like to welcome our affiliate in Bangor, Maine.  It finally happened. This is great. Syndication 2045. This is wonderful. 
[00:23:00]  This is a new technology. We're the last Earth-based show to syndicate. That's great.  They're all syndicated on Venus and Pluto. We got bang.  That's right. Now we're in Bangor, Maine. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony family.  Hey, honey, let me see your gas.  This is a funny bit for our new audience. Bangor, Maine 2045. 
[00:23:30]  I'm going to punch you in the uterus. You're a whore. Ouch, my teeth fell out.  This is killing me.  Hey, Tom Brokendall, NBC Nightly News. 
[00:24:00]  I've been dead for 20 years, but I'm still doing the news.  Dateline, Bangor, Maine. We welcome Opie and Anthony to affiliate WBMN.  Finally, syndication now.  What are you boys doing? You can't talk like that. We're going to lose your affiliate.  I'm sorry. What did we say? 
[00:24:30]  I know you didn't mention the name, but you mentioned the grandchildren's name.  Oh, boy, now it's good. We just lost our Bangor affiliate.  In the words of Robert Platt, does anyone remember laughter? I mean, come on.  We're just trying to have fun here.  laughter  Wow. 
[00:25:00]  Can't think about that, though. My butt's sore.  Yeah, that's a meeting.  Oof.  I'm never on the phone at home, ever, with anything concerning the radio.  I'm not.  I just don't get calls at home.  I don't make calls at home.  We do all our business here at the station, and then I leave. 
[00:25:30]  I speak with Opie on the phone, occasionally Rick, but it's usually, you know, what are you doing?  Yeah, that was a pretty fun show or something like that.  I was on the phone today.  Making sure you had a job.  I was on the phone today with Ken, our GM.  That's just not like you.  I know.  And for once in my career, I'm like, ah, F it.  I'm just like, I'm not even going to call.  Usually I'm on the phone trying to see what's going on. 
[00:26:00]  I'm just like, ah, screw it.  Yeah, what do we do this time?  Always in it.  Always band.  I think we still have jobs, though.  Yeah, could be.  You'll be waiting for syndication longer than Elion will be waiting for his mom to show up.  Oh, his mom's dead.  Chaz from Jersey.  Thank you, Chaz.  I don't know why we always get ourselves in this situation.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[00:26:30]  I gotta agree with that.  Okay, terrific.  All right, listen.  That's a little too real now.  I think that's exactly...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Stupid!  Who had audio in the boss's office when we were getting yelled at?  That's exactly what I heard today.  Wait, let me hear it one more time.  Isn't that funny when that word actually comes up in a meeting?  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Stupid!  You know, when was the last time you were called stupid, Opie?  I swear to God. 
[00:27:00]  The last time I was called stupid, I had to be...  I can't even think.  Had to be elementary school.  Yeah, definitely.  Like, fourth, fifth grade.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Actual audio of our boss.  I swear.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Prove it's not our boss's voice.  I dare you.  That's what we heard.  But we're just trying to have some fun. 
[00:27:30]  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  That's the voice of a guy that just has had it.  You know what I mean?  I gotta do that!  I gotta do that!  You're totally stupid!  You're so stupid!  Oh, my God.  We were called stupid. 
[00:28:00]  You were.  Stupid!  You're stupid!  I swear it had to be third grade.  I threw a thermos.  A classmate's thermos.  And shattered it?  The old glass thermoses.  The plaid ones.  They shatter inside?  In the playground against the tree.  And I got called into the principal's office.  And the kid that the thermos belonged to was sitting there crying.  And the principal shook the thermos.  And it was the broken glass.  And he said,  Anthony, why did you do this? 
[00:28:30]  I said,  I really don't know.  And he looked at me and said,  You know,  you're just stupid for doing this.  It's stuck in my head.  Now, fast forward.  Fast forward.  20 years.  20 friggin' years.  And all of a sudden.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Once again,  I'm being called stupid!  But at least I have a pal  that's also equally as stupid as I.  Hopi.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[00:29:00]  What do you say to that one?  Someone calls you stupid.  There's nothing I can say.  There's no response to it.  For the love of God.  You can't say anything back.  Okay.  How's it?  You're right.  I'm stupid.  Stupid, stupid.  But I got good teeth and good hair.  Old Bill might be stupid,  but he runs Old Bill's,  Wild Bill's Coffee Shop.  Okay. 
[00:29:30]  Scott, so you.  You're never called stupid.  See?  What do you think about that, Scott?  They called us stupid.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay, terrific.  Opie and Anthony.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  N-E-W.  New York's stupid radio.  O-N-A. 
[00:30:00]  Stupid!  Let it be known,  Opie and Anthony.  Just trying to have fun.  We're just trying to have a little fun here.  I just hope someone out there gets it before we get fired.  Stir it up a little.  Have a little bit of fun.  That's all we're trying to do,  if you think about it, really.  I love your shows.  Thank you.  Who's your stupid radio?  O-N-A.  On any show.  Stupid radio.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  I love you because you're stupid! 
[00:30:30]  Send the patient never, ever, ever, ever!  Ever!  We're just trying to have fun.  Have a little fun.  Give some people something fun to listen to on the drive home, Opie.  That's right.  That's all we're trying to do,  if you think about it, really.  A firing offense?  Hmm, maybe.  I don't know.  I need a box of donuts.  We're not like the guy that spits in the trooper's burger at the drive-thru.  We're just having fun. 
[00:31:00]  I don't know if we're hurting anyone.  Sure, we might be.  Stupid!  But, uh...  We're just trying to have fun.  Hello, uh, N-E-W.  Hi, this is Corky.  Oh, hi, Corky.  You two are stupid!  Thank you, Corky.  Corky's calling us stupid.  Everyone else is.  Stupid!  And we had the worst timing in the world, too. 
[00:31:30]  I know.  Tell me about it.  I was on the phone.  Tom Rooker, NBC Nightly News.  This just in, Opie and Anthony,  dubbed stupid.  By their bosses, stupid.  We have this clip of the boss.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  That's a piece of audio from the office earlier in the day. 
[00:32:00]  Merrill Lynch downgrading Opie and Anthony to a stupid...  Oh, man.  Stupid!  I swear it was third grade.  I was stupid.  Once again, I'm revisiting stupid.  Stupid.  Let's go back to the phone.  Hello, Opie and Anthony?  Hello?  Hey, Mike Tyson, what's up?  Yeah, you two are stupid.  S-L-B-I-F. 
[00:32:30]  Stupid.  Opie and Anthony.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  N-E-W.  All right.  More with your stupid, stupid pals, Opie and Anthony.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny  was to be on heroin.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  Fields of love.  And it's Opie and Anthony and Adam Farrar 
[00:33:00]  sitting in on the show today.  Having lots and lots of fun.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we get some brewskis in here?  Sure.  We just moved into a new office.  We had to get a second fridge.  Yeah.  There was a refrigerator in the office  that we're moving into,  but we're taking the one that was in our old office,  and that's going to be the beer fridge.  Just the beer.  Sounds sensible?  Well, it's a full-size Westinghouse refrigerator.  Just the beer fridge.  And then there's some little cubby hole 
[00:33:30]  with some ice in it for food.  There's some cold-cut drawing, throwing out.  We have our priorities.  You know, you can't get beer balls anymore.  Remember the beer balls you used to get?  I think I had them last weekend  after a full night of drinking.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Well, maybe.  You know the beer balls?  Not your own personal ones,  but the one for public consumption.  Right, the beer.  But what do you...  How old are you?  What'd you have in mind?  And you're still...  And you're still buying beer balls?  You want me to buy your beer?  What, are you going to hang out in the woods? 
[00:34:00]  You're a pisser.  You get him for lunch.  Not a beer ball.  It's a keg.  I'm not messing around.  I remember the parties  where someone,  Hey, I got a beer ball.  Cool.  Come on, we'll go over to Bison's house.  He's got a beer ball.  A beer ball.  We used to get him at the apartment.  You were always terrible.  I'll tell you one thing.  Yeah, these guys used to live together.  I'm strictly like a Bud guy.  I like a nice ice cold Bud coming out of the fridge.  I hated when people would come over,  Adam, 
[00:34:30]  with a six pack of warm Meister Brow.  We have Labette's.  Meister Brow.  The master brew.  And I put it in the fridge  and then pop a Bud.  I know those guys.  I was...  Well, okay.  How much money did I make, Mr. Radio Man?  Oh, yeah.  I was raking in a fortune  setting up above ground pools.  Yeah, no.  I was bringing in more money  digging holes for fences.  You were?  No, I wasn't.  You were making more money than I was, pal.  I wasn't. 
[00:35:00]  And then you went to that lucrative  selling binoculars job.  That was a good one.  What are you doing, Adam?  I'm selling binoculars.  And then the all-time favorite of mine,  when he comes over my house  with a water filtration system.  Now he's in the water filtration business.  Him and Jimbo.  You can be a millionaire.  And I have found the future.  He turned into Ralph Cramden.  I swear to God.  You're right.  Norton, get down here.  All of a sudden, I'm Norton. 
[00:35:30]  He's trying to sell me on this idea.  Water filtration, Norton.  Look, it's the wave of the future, pal.  Mr. Monahan will back us.  All you need to be a millionaire  is turn to rent.  Turn to rent.  He's telling me about this blue cylinder  that goes either under your sink  or right there next to the faucet  in a decorative canister.  And it hooks up to your system  and filters your water.  You know how many impurities  are in your water, pal?  Look at it.  There's sea monkeys floating in there.  And then I'm telling him,  well, what does this entail? 
[00:36:00]  What do you have to do  to get into this business  to hook these things up?  Are you installing them yourself?  Do you hire a crew?  He goes,  all you got to do is this.  And he makes the hand motion  of turning a wrench.  That was it.  That's all he ever told me.  That's your key to the future.  Key to the future.  The turn of a wrench.  A quarter turn of a wrench.  I go, well, what does it take?  What's the initial investment?  What do you have to do?  Where do you keep the equipment?  Turn to the wrench.  Turn to the wrench. 
[00:36:30]  He turned into Ralph friggin' Cramden.  You're right.  Pablo Mon Pizza.  Wave at a future.  Go to dark wallpaper.  Chef at a future.  We'll get a commercial, pal.  Maybe we should say something  about spearfish.  But that was the best one  after that.  And then he chose comedy.  I think you chose comedy  as you were doing  the water filtration.  No, I was a dishwasher.  Last straight was I was a dishwasher.  Oh, was that it?  Look at all the occupations, Adam. 
[00:37:00]  You were the air conditioning guy?  Yeah, I did that.  Thank God I got out of that.  But no, I think you always  made more money than I did.  No.  You could afford the Budweiser  and not the Meisterbrow.  How do you figure?  And what's the difference?  It's not like Bud,  you buy in Dom Perignon  or anything like that.  It always was a little more  than the Meisterbrow.  But I hated that.  Guys that would bring  warm Meisterbrow,  put it in the fridge  and pop my cold Buds.  I'll take your Bud.  I had to have money  for the bread pudding.  What that damn bread pudding?  What that damn bread pudding? 
[00:37:30]  I used to live over at Greenlawn,  an area of Greenlawn  that was really,  really turning ethnic  very quickly.  And a palatial place you had,  we used to call it  the Anne Frank Suite.  Yeah, I know.  Very nice.  You had to move the bookcase.  We'd go to the deli  around the corner  and you'd have to put  on your flak jacket.  I swear to God,  it was bad.  Near Sam's Pizza?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Over there.  It was bad.  Where one road divides,  I swear,  it's like all of a sudden  you're in Botswana. 
[00:38:00]  It was,  I swear to God.  And they're angry  they lost the soccer finals.  It was really bad.  Yeah, it was bad.  And the place was like  the honeycomb hideout.  It was like this little shack  and this lean-to.  But he had his Budweiser,  don't touch his bud.  Sitting on the couch  like the king.  Get out of the way.  It's my spot,  my beer.  He's like Daffy Duck.  Mine, mine, mine.  Down, down, down.  Go, go, go.  When I first moved in,  you could go to the stary.  When you first moved in,  he was a squatter. 
[00:38:30]  When he first moved in,  like there was a ceremony  in a truck.  I paid the first month's rent.  Yeah.  The landlord died  and people drive by  and go,  nobody can live there.  We used to duck.  You were in the house  a few times  when we saw  the landlord's car pull up.  Yeah.  Shut the lights in the TV.  Duck behind the windows.  He peeks in.  Yeah.  And we'd have to hide.  And you want to know  what's funny?  He would look in his living room  and go,  nobody lives there.  No one could possibly  live in that squatter.  But when we first moved in there,  the neighborhood was still okay. 
[00:39:00]  And you could go to the deli  and get things.  You know,  I would like a ham and Swiss  on a hero with mustard,  please.  Okay.  Right away, sir,  would you like coleslaw with that?  Yes.  Before it turned into the bodega?  All of a sudden,  oh,  I'm walking in,  I'm looking at foods,  it's like,  what is this?  Zebra?  It's zebra meat.  Bean pie,  my brother?  Yeah,  I didn't know what the,  oh,  look,  Opie's,  Opie's hair of the bell.  Opie's going to bell me.  Yeah,  you got to watch out  for those delis  with the zebra meat. 
[00:39:30]  Black people did.  No,  but the neighborhood  turned really quick  after that.  And the whole line  of stores now  is boarded up.  And the funniest part  about the neighborhood,  the police station  was three blocks  down in the corner.  They never went  down that street.  No,  hell no.  The cops wouldn't  go down there.  I got a family,  I'm not going down there.  They were better on.  Yeah,  no.  Why would you want  to drive down there?  Oh,  man.  That was,  we had a lot of fun  at that place.  That is very funny stuff.  Remind me about it  because I don't  remember any of it.  Yes,  you do. 
[00:40:00]  It all is a blur,  Adam.  I remember we used  to hide stuff  because there was  holes in the walls.  So like you could  put stuff in the walls  and everything.  Here comes the landlord,  ditch the computer,  and put it in the wall.  How about the time  I dropped the camcorder  down a hole  in the bathroom wall  into the ceiling  of the downstairs apartment  because they used  to fight all the time  down there  and recorded  everything that happened.  Are you like Chuck Berry?  It's on the TV.  Yeah.  We got it hooked up  to the TV.  It's like,  look at him fight.  Come on. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Oh,  he was like a mad scientist.  Kind of like  that scene in  Revenge of the Nerds.  Yeah,  that was it.  That was you.  And he was up there  drinking his butt  going,  look at that.  She ain't going  to take any more of this.  Watch,  she's going to hit him.  See,  what did I tell you?  We drop it through.  They had a hung ceiling  downstairs.  So at first,  I had to drop  through a string  with a barbed hook  at the end  to lift the ceiling  tile up a little bit.  And then we laid  the camcorder down  and just watched them  yell at each other  and hope and sex.  It was funny,  while he was setting  this stuff up,  we'd be like humming 
[00:41:00]  the Mission Impossible music.  I was going to call him  Anthony MacGyver.  Oh,  yeah.  All kinds of stuff.  Muff Diver.  Muff Diver.  I remember the night  I spent in jail  and I came,  I had to come back  after that.  Oh,  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  Now,  Adam,  why did you have  to go to jail?  we played a gig  actually at the,  what was that little  bar by the OTB?  That was another  Get Rich Squish game.  I got a tip.  So the water purifiers.  Eighth race  at Aqueduct.  Our ship is coming in. 
[00:41:30]  Dumb legs in the eight.  What's the horse  you bet on  that died?  Yeah,  died in the backstretch.  But I mean really died.  They brought out  a bulldozer.  As in dead.  Dropped dead.  Animal house  had a heart attack.  Adam just looks at me  and goes,  I'm never betting  with you again.  I had it to die.  I made a fortune.  I bet it to die.  Win,  lose,  or die.  Yeah,  we did a gig  and we were coming home  and you got arrested  with some chick.  No,  the girl got arrested. 
[00:42:00]  Right,  the girl got arrested.  She got arrested  for drunk driving  and I was in the car.  So the cop pulls her  and goes,  look,  she's drunk,  you got to drive  the car home.  I said,  look,  I had some drinks too.  I'm not getting in this car.  You're locking me up too.  He goes,  no,  come on,  just follow me to the station.  I said,  oh,  okay.  She was the girl  with the big D's,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah,  she was a,  all right.  Weren't you dating  my sister at the time?  No,  I wasn't.  No,  this was PD.  Okay.  Post dawn.  All right.  So we go in there  and she's arrested  and the guy comes out  and the cop comes out 
[00:42:30]  and goes,  look,  she's got to sleep it off here.  And I said,  to be honest with you,  I had some drink.  I don't feel comfortable.  I better sleep it off with her.  Yeah.  He's still trying to score.  Can we get a private cell?  So she's sleeping it off  and I'm there.  It's the middle of the night.  What am I going to do?  Call my parents?  Hi,  I'm not arrested,  but I'm in jail.  You know what my father would say?  Stay there.  Stay there,  right.  So I'm playing cop,  I'm playing cards  with the cops there at night.  We're just sitting there.  I knock with a four,  Garrity.  I want a couple of dollars  playing poker with the cops.  And the cops,  then the cops start like, 
[00:43:00]  you know,  just nailing me  when he goes,  you're missing out  on some prime rodeo time.  She's going to sober up  and not want any potty.  The Opie Identity Show.  He's fighting.  Put more in there.  Put more in there.  Christy is being,  Christy's fighting better,  which means more.  More.  I got it.  The tank is coming apart.  Coming soon,  the return of the  55-gallon drum challenge  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  All right. 
[00:43:30]  My girlfriend's on the line?  Yeah.  Sandy.  Hey, Sandy.  Hi.  You're on the air there.  Are you going to hang me out  to dry?  No, but please.  Come on.  What?  You agree with Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  What's this?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, first of all,  you're Italian at home.  What are you talking about?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Am I a Minuteman, Sandy? 
[00:44:00]  No.  See, I'm not.  I think you're practicing  that pan trick sex  that thing practices.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  No, I've got Italian.  Really?  Yeah.  What's his name?  Oh, wow.  Sandy, you remember  when we first started  having sex, though, right?  Yeah.  After our first date?  Yeah.  No.  Why is your brother  ready to punch me?  Because. 
[00:44:30]  Remember, though,  it was like it was  a lot quicker.  Yes, but that was...  Well, that's the point  I'm trying to make today.  When you first start  going out with someone new,  you know, it's hypersensitive  and, you know,  you don't last as long.  Yeah, you got a point there.  I don't know what  Ann was getting at  at all today.  I was getting at  giving Chris,  a caller, some advice  that you learned  during the years  on how to work.  That's true, yeah.  As you get older.  You know, it was  two different pieces  of advice  given by Opie and I  and all of a sudden 
[00:45:00]  it turned into  this whole thing.  I don't know.  Ann's the minute woman.  I am not.  Tell Rick to close his ears  because I am not.  Well, what's wrong  with being a minute woman  if you were?  Because I'm not.  That means you can't,  you know.  What?  You can't hold out.  You can't hold out.  No, you're really good.  Shut up.  Why?  Because I know  he's listening  on top of everyone else  who listens to your show.  What, your brother Rick  who's sitting afoot from me?  Yeah, look. 
[00:45:30]  He's got his sleeves  rolled up.  Rick with the big arms.  Yeah, Rick.  Steroid boy,  get over there, man.  He's like standing over me  making sure I don't say  anything bad to you.  All I was saying  with the whole  finishing up quickly  so you can recover  for the next time  and then proving yourself  thing is it takes  the oral factor  out of the mix  right after that  and that kind of,  yeah, because what guy  is going to want to  submerge  if that's the case? 
[00:46:00]  So you've got to  work around that.  Yeah.  Sand?  Yeah.  I apologize.  I haven't done that lately.  I cannot believe  you're saying.  I apologize.  Well,  Rick is right there.  You don't enjoy that?  No, I do.  I don't know what,  I just haven't lately, right?  We don't need to discuss this.  What's wrong?  We don't need to discuss it.  What's the matter, Opie?  What?  No, there's nothing  wrong with that.  I just, you know,  I just, I don't know.  Why aren't you doing that, Opie?  I just haven't.  I just haven't lately. 
[00:46:30]  What's the matter?  She gave me a homer  last Friday, though.  Oh, gee.  Ah, look at Rick.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Emergency.  Oh, no.  Get out of the way.  Are you crazy?  That's okay.  It probably only lasted  a minute for Opie, so.  Ah.  San.  We can't discuss this.  Wait, well,  you better discuss  what he just said  because it wasn't,  say it.  It was like two minutes.  No.  I'm not going to say  what I want to say. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, say it.  What do you want to say?  You hang out to dry.  Did I last a minute?  No, you don't,  the liver's longer.  A little longer?  Yeah, but I was  almost getting  like lockjaw.  Why did you  almost get lockjaw?  What's the problem, man?  Nothing.  Too big?  No.  Look, no.  She says no real quick.  Why did you  almost get lockjaw?  I'm just kidding.  Oh, all right.  It's just a joke. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  She was flossing  her teeth.  Ugh.  Lockjaw.  Sweets,  I promise I'll,  you know.  All right.  We don't need  to discuss that.  Well, I know  you like it and stuff,  so.  Cut it out.  What?  He's not getting  that mad.  He's turning red.  Well, I mean,  I don't want him  to get a visual.  Oh, you got to do that.  What are you doing?  I have, right, Sam?  Sam?  Not lately, I know.  You're telling the listeners  the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  guys were asking you  to reciprocate, 
[00:48:00]  and then,  what?  You know,  you're not going  below the covers there?  How long, Sweets?  A month?  A while.  Oh, B.  Come on, man.  What?  That's fair,  because I don't  always do that either.  Right.  So it works out.  Sam, how's my technique,  though?  Which technique  are we talking about?  My oral technique.  Why do you have  to get back on that?  Because I'm really curious.  No, it's wonderful.  Oh, it is good?  Yeah.  It's not like I'm,  like, you know,  that convincing.  Like Sam Kinison said,  it's not like I'm  just painting a fence.  No, you're not  painting a fence. 
[00:48:30]  Sam, thanks for  clearing it up.  I'm not a minute man.  No, you're a stallion.  I'm a stallion.  My oral technique  is pretty good.  Yes.  Oh, his oral technique  is pretty good.  Just ask any guy.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Sam, it seemed like  you finally are starting  to enjoy the doggy  a little bit.  Oh, man.  Look, Rick's right here.  Well, let's just see.  Dude, what? 
[00:49:00]  Oh, Rick.  Because when he said that,  instantly everyone  gets a visual,  including Rick.  You don't need that.  See, now that's  going too far.  That's worse.  The reach around  was a hit.  I hit.  We have a problem.  I'm dogging your sister.  Get over it.  Oh, man.  Oh, God damn.  What's the problem?  That is not right.  That is just not right.  How could that possibly  be a problem?  You can't put it like that, man.  No, dude.  You can't do that.  Some tact. 
[00:49:30]  We've been there  for six years.  It's about time  you found out  that I'm doing her.  I don't think  I need to hear  about the  certain positions  that you're into.  You got any videos, man?  Shut up, Chuck.  You ass.  Chuck has made it  into the studio.  Hi, Chuck.  Yo, what's up?  Hey, man.  I just came by  for a beer. 
[00:50:00]  All right, I'll let you  off the hook.  There's a lot more  I want to say,  but I think I've said enough.  I don't know  if you're letting me  off the hook.  Like what?  Well, doggie.  Even he's doing it  that way.  Use it or lose it.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, Greg,  what's up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do me a favor, Anthony.  From one guinea  to another,  take over the show.  Rick, take this boy  backstage, smack him.  How dare you? 
[00:50:30]  What?  Smack the blonde  out of this boy's head  to talk about  this man's sister  like that on the radio.  Wait a minute.  You're not even married?  Rick, as one man  to another from the gym,  please, smack the thigh  out of his head.  That's pretty bad, huh?  I'm seething.  Anthony, from one guinea  to another,  how dare you  let this man  talk like that  about this gentleman's sister?  What?  Well, you know something?  It's none of my business.  Get your hand  on that button ready.  I've been going out  with it for six  and a half years. 
[00:51:00]  I don't give a gut  excuse me.  I think at this point  Rick can handle the fact  that I'm dogging a sister.  My brother Laura  is married ten years  to my sister.  He talks like that.  He ain't going home  with feet.  I mean...  Duh, duh, duh, duh.  Rick, smack him.  Spaz was supposed  to punch me yesterday.  Now you want Rick  to punch me.  Why?  Punch you?  My friend.  You're talking about  this man's sister  like she's some kind of pig.  And Sandy,  you're listening.  Shame on you for calling.  Shame on you.  Come on.  Sandy knows that.  Anthony, you're Italian.  You understand?  Yeah, I had a stand-up comic 
[00:51:30]  dogging my sister.  All right.  All right.  Please.  Rick, smack him.  All right.  Thank you.  Go, Yankees.  All right.  You guys are the best  and you're sucking,  but Rick,  you swallow  if you don't hit him.  All right.  I can't let that be.  No.  Oh, wow.  He's going to get up  and snack.  He said I swallow  if I don't hit him.  I got to hit him.  You got to hit him?  I got to hit him.  Wait.  If you said jump off  the Brooklyn Bridge,  would you?  No, because that's stupid.  Rick, you really do  have reason to hit him.  I know.  No, he doesn't.  You should hit him. 
[00:52:00]  Hit him.  I have every good reason.  Hit him, man.  No, Spaz had every reason  to hit me yesterday.  Rick, hit him.  You have no reason.  Dude, I've got a great reason.  You know how I treat you.  You know how close they are  as a family and stuff?  They're very protective  of each other  and you say you're dogging her  and doggy style.  Shut up.  She's giving you hummers.  Shut up.  Rick, Rick.  I mean, Ed, shut up.  Shut up.  You know, the truth is, though, Rick,  if he wasn't married,  it would be one thing.  Chuck, shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You see how big his arms are?  Shut up.  Dude, you don't lift weights. 
[00:52:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's true.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Test run those arm muscles, man.  He's steroid, boy.  Shut up.  God bless you, steroid boy.  I'm telling you.  I am not steroid boy,  for Christ's sake.  Well, I can't say that word.  I don't have man boobs.  You got man breasts.  Sorry I don't spend  eight hours a day at the gym.  Go get yourself a bro.  A man's ear.  What? 
[00:53:00]  A bra?  It's called a bro.  It's a Seinfeld reference, right?  Right, Seinfeld reference.  I caught it now.  It's the bro, Jerry.  It's the bro, Jerry.  Now you've gone too far, man.  Now you've gone too far.  A bro?  Get away from me.  Sit down.  Spaz had every right yesterday.  You're right.  I think I'm going to punch him.  Hit him.  Where would you hit him, Rick?  Joey, shut up.  See, I don't know if I can hit him  in the man boobs  because my hand might get swallowed up.  No, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Joey, just remember  who does your live reads. 
[00:53:30]  Do you think Ant  can remember all that info?  We just know everything  in the spring.  Wait a minute.  I know everything  about Paisanos.  Screw you, jackass.  I know everything  about Paisanos.  Why are you hanging me out  to dry?  Look how big he is, man.  I know everything  about Paisanos, Joey.  Who's down there more?  Me or Opie?  I've got to say Anthony's.  That's right.  All right.  Come on.  I know who you like better.  That's all right, Joey.  He is taking him  to the game tonight.  All right.  Yeah.  Come on.  We've got to stick together.  Go with to find 
[00:54:00]  the Polish guys.  Someone get Rick  out of the studio.  I feel like I've got  to hit him.  All right.  I'm not.  Rick looks like a caged tiger  right now, man.  He's like stalking you, man.  You know what it is?  He's in conflict  right now in his head.  He knows he should get up  Shut up, man!  That's what he said.  Rick, Rick, Rick.  But there's some kind of conflict  because he does genuinely  like Opie  and doesn't want to hurt him.  But there is quite the reason  He looks like he could  snap you like a twig.  What if you say something  bad to my sister?  What am I going to say  about your sister?  I'm not banging her.  I'll call her out. 
[00:54:30]  I can take care of that.  Can you bang her?  Yeah.  Can I bang your sister?  Let him bang your sister.  She's six months pregnant.  If that gets you off,  you sick app,  then go for it.  Yeah, he's the sick app.  Wait, I thought you liked that.  Yeah, you're the one  that liked that.  I thought you were  the preggers, man.  Wait.  Hey, Rick,  let me ask you, though.  Chuck.  No, I just want to know.  Like Spaz,  if you were to hit Opie,  would he have the power  to fire you?  Because him telling Spaz  to hit me was like  my wife going, 
[00:55:00]  I know you cheated on me.  Just tell me.  It'll be okay.  Go ahead.  Technically,  I have the power of veto  on anything Opie besides  and vice versa.  And listen,  I don't want it to come down  to a firing thing.  That's just beyond...  Then let him sock you one.  No.  Let him just tag you one.  Rick, sit down.  Jesus, sit down.  Let him just tag you one, man.  That'll be kind of cool.  Just one shot.  You guys will still be friends.  Feel like brothers now.  Yeah, yeah.  Just one shot.  Look how big his freaking arms are.  You know,  brothers used to wrestle around.  Maybe I can give you a wedgie. 
[00:55:30]  How does that sound?  How about I give you a wedgie?  That's a little homo, man.  That's a homo thing.  It's not a homo thing.  Doggy style, dude.  Ed, shut up!  Instead, he did your sister doggy style.  Oh, man.  That's kind of...  Rick, sit down!  And Ed, shut up!  I got to tell you,  Hey, Rick, hey, Rick...  The lockjaw statement.  Hey, Rick, my...  The reach around.  Shut up, man.  The reach around.  I forgot about that one.  The reach around.  Oh, wow.  What a guy giving her the reach around.  The reach around was...  Wait, if I recall correctly,  the reach around was working pretty good. 
[00:56:00]  Banging her.  If you're going to...  the word banging...  Hold on, wait!  Not making...  Oh, my God.  Rick, Rick, Rick just threw the chair.  Oh, Rick, this is getting bad.  As if it's getting ugly.  All right, I am in the corner.  Spaz, Spaz, hold on a second.  Hold on.  I do have one thing to say.  Doggy style.  Hold on a second.  I got something to say.  Just remember.  Put the bottle down.  First of all... 
[00:56:30]  Oh, my God.  Dude, you freaking hung me out.  What did I do?  I'm just repeating what you said to the man.  Rick's about to break that bottle.  It's going to look like a black exploitation film in here in a minute.  What did I say?  You forgot to remind him that Sandy did say that I was good at oral.  Oh!  Oh, Rick's got him down.  Rick has got him down.  There is no contest here.  There's no contest here.  Rick's got him totally.  Oh, my God.  He's trying to get away.  There's no way Opie can get away.  No way.  He's got him around the neck.  Oh, he's got him out. 
[00:57:00]  Opie's trying to get Rick's arm from around his neck, but it is not working.  I had not...  Rick is totally dominating this brawl on the floor.  Opie cannot get away.  He's got one hand.  He's trying to hit Rick on the back of the...  Opie just punched Rick on the side of the face.  Rick is sitting...  Rick is sticking his crotch in Opie's face.  He's sticking...  He's got his leg wrapped around Rick, and he's flipping him over.  Opie having a hard time recovering from Rick, because Rick is on top the whole time. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, my God.  Wait, Rick's pulling Opie's pants down.  Opie now getting really pissed.  He's totally ready.  He's got Rick in a headlock.  He's dragging him back on the ground.  He's pissed.  Two points for the reverse.  Two points for the reverse.  Opie can't seem to get Rick down, though.  Rick like a bulldog.  Yeah, it's very, very hard to get Rick down.  Opie working, but I think he's tiring at this point.  Rick's endurance is going to start taking over now. 
[00:58:00]  Rick obviously dominating this brawl.  Opie getting a couple of good shots in, but Rick sticking his crotch in Opie's face.  I think the most degrading thing I've ever seen.  He looked like Opie's head was a marshmallow for a second.  And Rick is up.  Opie's still down.  Hey, Rick.  Hey.  How do you feel?  Somebody call a medic, man.  Still got endurance and stuff.  Somebody call a medic.  Somebody call a medic.  Opie almost gave me a rusty trombone.  How you doing, Opie?  How you doing? 
[00:58:30]  How you doing?  How you doing?  Joey Bull.  Oh, putting up a valiant effort, but he's hard to take down, huh?  Yeah.  He's like a little fire hydrant.  A bulldog.  Dude, watch that one song comes to mind.  Come, come, come, come, come.  Yeah, that's an appropriate song.  We should have been playing it while you two are on the floor. 
[00:59:00]  Opie, what did you think when Rick put his crotch right over your face?  I was just thinking that, uh...  Gee, his ass smells terrific.  Wait, what's the question again?  What were you thinking when Rick stuck his crotch right in your face?  I was about to give you a happy wife.  No, don't say it.  I know what he was going to say.  I know what he was going to say, too.  How much you're like your sister. 
[00:59:30]  Sorry, I had to do it, man.  I had to do it.  Oh, Rick's going to kick your ass now.  He's going for the black guy, you know.  His arms aren't big, but I had never bet on the white guy, and he's fine.  Oh.  Holy cow.  He's pretty rough, huh?  I thought the first time I had so...  No, I won't say it.  Because I need to say his last name for the joke.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I didn't do too bad.  I didn't do too bad.  Look, your headphones are broken.  I got to get it.  Your headphones are totally broken.  Your glasses are on the floor.  It's like you're just a mess.  You know what?  Opie's pretty good.  He can hold his own, man.  I got to get it.  Because Rick's a big guy.  At one point, I did see Opie reached around and punched Rick in the side of the head.  I think he was trying to get his arm around the back.  He punched you in the side of the head, and then Rick just lost it.  And you were like a rag doll at that point, Opie. 
[01:00:30]  Rick's got some power to him there.  That mega mix.  Oh, look at his arms, man.  I knew I had a testosterone powder drink mix.  I knew there was going to be a problem there.  It looked like a prison cell workout, man.  Opie was clean of the weight room ball.  You go to sleep when I tell you to go to sleep.  But not after you toss myself.  Wow.  I've never seen a brawl like that in this studio.  I wish I had gas.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  If you would have squeaked one out, if you could have, you would have? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Using the animalistic sitting on the opponent to try to...  Yeah, what the hell was that about, man?  That's what monkeys do.  I know, Rick.  What was that?  I was hoping to squeak.  I was hoping to squeak.  Those swollen-ass monkeys do that to, like, you know...  To dominate.  To dominate.  You know what I mean?  And it shows dominance.  I do want to stay for the record, he was trying to give me a wedgie.  Dr. Zayas did that to me.  Sat on me.  From his ear in Cornelius.  Made me look like a buffoon. 
[01:01:30]  Red monkey-ass all over my face.  Damn him to hell.  That's a long time coming.  Yeah.  A little tension there, huh?  Yeah, it's a hell of a lot less tense in here now, though.  Yeah, well...  I'm breathing a sigh of relief.  I'll get some tension out tonight.  He doesn't quit.  He doesn't quit.  I did what?  That doesn't mean anything.  What, you're going to roll around with another man? 
[01:02:00]  Come on.  It's a joke, isn't it?  New York shock jocks Opie and Anthony are now on the air.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Balloon Not Pleasure.  Yeah, if you need lube, you're a loser.  Take it like a champ, okay?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Spreading like AIDS in Haiti.  We have to go right to the phones, Anthony.  What do we got?  Jonathan Harris is on the line.  Stop it. 
[01:02:30]  You may remember him as Dr. Smith.  Everybody remembers the beloved Dr. Zachary Smith from Lost in Space.  Jonathan Harris.  Yes.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you?  Thank you.  I'm so glad you said beloved.  Beloved.  I was beloved by all the fans.  You were most beloved, Dr. Smith.  Oh, lovely.  Look at that.  We have the old clattering clunk of colligionous junk.  Oh, yes.  It always works, doesn't it?  So, uh, what are we doing, uh, Dr. Zachary Smith, these days? 
[01:03:00]  Well, what are we doing?  We're doing voice work exclusively.  Exclusively.  No more films.  I've done six mission films.  This record never been broken.  Yes, we've heard you're on Toy Story.  And I didn't want to do anymore.  Didn't have to do anymore.  You've done voices on Toy Story?  Oh, Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life.  A Bug's Life.  Oh, I forgot you were in Bugs Life.  That's right.  You forgot?  Huh.  I killed for less.  Now, uh, have you...  Marvelous movie. 
[01:03:30]  Have you...  And I was so good in it, I thought.  Well, yeah, of course.  You want us to kiss your ass?  Oh, lovely.  Yes.  That is making a window.  Oh, you boys are dangerous.  I have to watch it.  Yes, yes.  Have you seen anybody from the old, uh, Lost in Space series?  Uh, occasionally.  Occasionally, I have a little lunch with one or two of them.  Maybe Judy?  Judy or Penny?  Oh, they're both lovely ladies, my dear.  How about...  They're lovely, lovely ladies. 
[01:04:00]  Is Major West still upset with you?  I haven't got a clue.  Nor do I give a f***.  As we say in the trade.  Wow!  Hey, Dr. Smith's cursed.  Dr. Smith's cursed.  Oh, don't let me go on.  I never heard that one on the TV show.  Well, you know, no, no, we were very careful.  We played a little game.  He didn't like me, and I didn't like him, and we played a little game.  Oh, dear.  Now, otherwise, he's a very nice fella.  Now, why didn't you like him, Dr. Smith?  On the show? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  He posed a danger to me, I thought.  At least I decided that.  You know, in television, in series television, you've got to make decisions about the relationships  that you have with people to make it interesting.  Here comes the enola game.  And I thought that my relationship with Mark Goddard was interesting.  Rolling down the tarmac.  He played a little game, and that was fun.  Well, what was your relationship with the young boy, William?  Oh, what a darling good actor he was.  Yes, I bet, yes.  Oh, lovely. 
[01:05:00]  Yes, young boy.  Well, you see, again, I study the territory.  I've been in this business for, you know, a thousand years at least.  Hey!  And I studied the territory.  Hey!  I realized early on that he was very, very important to me.  I bet he was, indeed.  And I was to him.  Yes, you are, yes.  So that we were, you know, marvelous together, I thought.  Very chemically suited.  I always thought it was quite fascinating when you were in danger and you would pull the young  boy towards you.  I dreamed that up all by myself. 
[01:05:30]  I bet you did.  Worked like a charm.  Worked like a charm, did it?  I got thousands of letters about that, about my cowardice.  I would see you hide behind his hairless young body.  Hey!  Hey, you see?  Yes, young boy.  That was very important because it was another aspect of my character that I developed.  I was a coward, amongst other things.  Amongst other things.  I was greedy.  I was selfish.  I was quite adorable.  Yes, sir.  And all of these things I did. 
[01:06:00]  You see, I dreamed them up.  Do you know that in my vast career, my dear, may I say vast?  Hey!  Yes.  I was given an opportunity by Irwin Allen, who was a strange and complex man.  Coming from you?  To do the, oh, the, everything that I wanted to do.  It had never happened to me.  Yes.  So that I had, I had been able to create...  Like clutching young boys!  Woo!  ...character from the, uh, from the ground up.  Which was wonderful for an actor. 
[01:06:30]  It was wonderful for me.  So you improvised all those scenes with young William where you were...  Oh, improvisation and television, everything is written down.  Clutch him and maul that tender, hairless young body.  Oh, dear!  How do you know it was a hairless young body, ha?  He was but, what, nine years old, Dr. Smith?  Oh, you know that.  You saw him buck naked?  Yes.  Maybe, maybe.  Oh, you didn't.  Oh, dear.  Maybe I was bringing him up.  Very, very good actor.  Billy Moomy.  Billy Moomy, yes.  I'd like to wrap him up like a little moomy. 
[01:07:00]  Why are you talking, Mrs. Smith?  Woo!  Huh?  I want to go home, sweet, sweet home.  Oh, dear.  Oh, my God, I did say that several times, didn't I?  Yes, yes.  Well, you see, again, I exercised all of the aspects of my character.  Yes.  I was allowed to do that.  What planet did you go to to find K.Y. Jelly?  Oh, for the young boy.  Hey!  Young, tight, William Bucket.  Let me tell you.  Woo!  Hey!  Out of all the 612 films I've done, Lost in Space was really the one. 
[01:07:30]  Who knew at that time that Lost in Space would become a cult classic worldwide?  Yes.  I never gave it a thought, I have to tell you.  So the whole world was still groping, groping.  That's so.  Wait till you be quiet, Opie.  Wow!  He's blaming Opie, thank God.  I've done so much television and theater, and I always knew that the curtain comes down.  Oh, very difficult to get a word in this, Roz, here. 
[01:08:00]  Yes, certainly.  Yeah.  Tell me, Opie, what is Opie short for?  Anything?  He's blaming Opie.  Is that a nickname?  Uh, yes.  Ah.  You remember Opie on Mayberry, that young, subtle boy?  Yes, Ron Howard.  Ron Howard, yes.  Wonderful director.  Yes, very hairless.  Ah.  You have a face about hairless young bodies?  Yes, we do, don't we, Dr. Smith?  Oh, very, very serious.  Yes, yes.  Oh, very, very serious. 
[01:08:30]  Totally crazy.  You're almost as crazy as I am.  But you'll get there.  Yes.  Anyway.  Yes.  It's a lovely thing to talk to you.  We enjoy you.  I hope that you will remain well and happy.  Enjoy your work.  And engrossed in your work.  Being engrossed like I was in my life.  And it pays off, you know.  It certainly does.  To be totally dedicated to the work.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  One must do that.  Uh, Dr. Smith, would you like to talk to a few of our listeners?  Sure.  They love you.  As well they should.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jack.  Jack, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Uh, Dr. Smith.  Yes, Jack?  I was wondering if you could tell me at what age young William grew hair.  And I think you know what I'm talking about.  What kind of a...  Again, the naked young body?  What kind of a...  Oh, you know you've seen it more than once, Dr. Smith.  What kind of a question is that?  Dear boy. 
[01:09:30]  Okay, thank you, Jack.  Jack.  Yeah.  Jack, can I answer your question?  Yeah, Dr. Smith, we've got to apologize for that.  That's all right.  Some of our listeners, they're out there, my dear.  They're out there.  Yeah.  Only the serious questions for, uh, Dr. Smith.  Let's go to Joey.  Joey, what's up?  Hi.  Oh, it's a girl.  You!  Disgusting women!  Boo!  Well, I'm sorry, but I was calling to ask a question.  I need Opie and Anthony's help, Dr. Smith.  Yeah?  Well, I don't know that you'll be interested. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah?  It's about, you know, boobs.  Inner boobs?  Yeah.  You bubble-headed boobie.  I've got a serious problem, Dr. Smith, and I really was wanting Opie and Anthony's help.  What is your problem, my dear?  Here's the deal.  So, um, when I was a young girl, being stupid and believing my boyfriend when he said, trust  me.  Oh, dear.  Famous last word.  Exactly.  Run for the hills!  So, I'm a very young girl, but I have a daughter who's almost 17. 
[01:10:30]  Uh-huh.  And she's drop-dead gorgeous.  And I'm pretty, too, but she looks more like Pamela Anderson, and I look more like, uh,  oh, I don't know.  I'm an attractive woman, what can I tell you?  Get to your question.  She has an incredibly, incredibly large chest.  Huh?  And she walks around with low-cut blouses and all that stuff.  And guys literally hang their heads out the window, whistling at her, and she says, they're  not looking at that. 
[01:11:00]  They're looking at her face.  And I wanted their opinion on that.  Do guys look at a girl's face, or do they look at the chest?  Because it's out there.  Uh, Dr. Smith?  Well, it's very serious, of course, how they look where their eyes lead them.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  I think that she's probably pretty happy with them.  Oh, because they can be adjusted, you know, with a knife.  And if she's not happy with them, she should do something about it.  You know, these women do.  That was the same excuse I used. 
[01:11:30]  I just said I was looking at young William Seam on the back of his pants.  Well, if she's happy with that, she's going to have to face the fact that either she wears  a very tight bra to pull them up, or she shows them.  And at 17, I guess she's going to show them.  How did Judy fit into it?  Just watch her like a hawk.  Dr. Smith, how did Judy fit into that tight little, like, saran wrap or tin foil?  Oh, gorgeous.  He still is, by the way.  Dr. Smith, ask Opie when he sees a beautiful girl walking down the street. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Is he attracted to the chest first or the face?  Oh, Opie goes right to the boobs.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Every guy goes right to the boobs, and then you check out the face after that.  Now, let's say there's a young boy.  A young boy.  That's what I keep telling her.  All right.  Well, thank you, Joey.  You guys agree.  Thank you, Shelly.  Joey.  Is that your name, Shelly?  Joey.  Oh, Joey.  So sorry.  Joey.  Oh, good luck with your beautiful daughter.  Dr. Smith. 
[01:12:30]  See?  Yes, in a related question, when you see a young boy of nine or ten walk by, do you look  in the eyes or the brown eyes?  Oh, dear boy.  Woo!  Hey!  Oh, you're very naughty.  Naughty, indeed.  You're very naughty.  Where's that metallic crustacean?  Oh, shut up, Doctor.  You know, all of those alliterations I made up.  You're a genius.  Every single one of us.  Genius, let me tell you.  And I used them all.  It was just one.  A dream come true, lost in space with a young boy. 
[01:13:00]  Woo!  Oh, dear.  Very serious.  I don't know the aliens.  Yes, I had to protect him.  Lots of people have said, have asked me, rather, was there any sex on Lost in Space?  Oh, yeah.  And I have answered quite truthfully, yes.  Yes.  In the robot.  Oh, really?  Oh, it hurt a lot.  Ouch, Dr. Smith.  Please, that is my data report.  That is very interesting.  Please, go back to William.  Yes, there must have been a lot of sex. 
[01:13:30]  What is your notice for William?  You never saw William sit down, what, getting jealous, are you, man?  No, no, no.  Yeah, boy.  You're beginning to sound very much like me.  Yes, indeed.  I like that young boy.  I like what his little sack is like a plucked chicken.  I can do me.  Yes.  Very often, I can't even do me.  Yes.  But there you are.  That's going to drop some image, Dr. Smith.  I do voice work, as I've told you.  Yes, yes.  And I go to the studio, and there are the voice wizards, who are absolutely fantastic. 
[01:14:00]  Fabulous.  They can do 12 different voices, you see.  Yes, you do.  And I can barely do me.  Yes.  You know?  Well, your voice...  It's very exciting for me.  Your voice is very recognizable.  I think so.  I'm sure Billy Moomer still spins around in fear when he hears it.  And I sell it for money.  Yes.  And it's a very individual sound, and I know it.  When I'm hired, they know exactly what they're going to get.  Dr. Zachary Smith. 
[01:14:30]  Because I don't do trick voices, I'm not able to do that.  No.  Nor have I any interest in doing that.  But I do find myself in awe of these marvelous voice wizards.  All right.  Let's go to Doug.  Doug, do you have a question for Dr. Zachary Smith?  Doug?  Oh, Dr. Smith, big fan.  Yes, good.  When you were on Lost in Space, you would travel all over the solar system.  Yeah.  I was wondering, did you ever let young William explore Uranus?  Well, he tried once, but I slapped his face. 
[01:15:00]  Hey.  Oh, my.  I told him I was going to tell his mother.  There you are.  Dr. Smith is headed towards Uranus.  Run, young William.  Yes, Dr. Smith.  Alan, you're next with Dr. Zachary Smith.  Uh, now, uh, Zachary Smith, I got a, a, a very serious question for you.  This sounds like a young boy.  I got a serious question.  How do I make my pubic hairs grow faster? 
[01:15:30]  Who the hell knows?  I would suggest that you take a razor and just slice them off.  Why would I say that?  And be very careful.  Do it the same way William, uh, did it.  Uh, they're growing faster when I gave a vigorous massage.  Radio station, by the way.  A vigorous massage to the region.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, my dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  What a bunch of strange folks are answering the phone.  Yes.  Where, where, where do you live now, Dr. Smith? 
[01:16:00]  I live in California, Southern California.  Oh, dear.  And I'm absolutely in the San Fernando Valley.  Of course, yes.  And I have lived here for...  Who is San Fernando?  Next question, please.  Yeah, Dr. Smith.  Well, are you having fun with our little radio show today, Dr. Smith?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yes, indeed.  Any more calls for Dr. Smith?  Yeah, let's, uh, let's take another one here.  You were very, uh, Dr. Smith, I noticed you were very, uh, evil in the first few episodes... 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  ...of Lost in Space, and then they really fagged you out, like they made you...  Well, I did that myself.  Okay.  I hated that evil man.  Really?  Of course.  Really?  I'm an old hand at this.  I said to myself, playing that kind of evil, snarling villain, in about five shows, they'll  have to kill me off, I'll be out of work again.  Yes.  Now, I'm just the famous, I have to tell you, with no pride at all...  Of course.  ...that I've specialized for many years in comedic villainy, which I love. 
[01:17:00]  Comedic villainy.  Comedic villainy, because you can redeem yourself from the villainy if it's comedic.  Indeed.  So I decided that since I knew they would have to kill me off, I would take a chance and  begin to introduce my comedic villainy bits, and hopefully nobody would notice.  Evil, yet quite lovable, weren't you?  Be quiet, sir.  Indeed.  Irwin Allen, of course, noticed.  Dr. Smith.  Yes?  Dr. Smith. 
[01:17:30]  Yes?  You owe me an apology.  Not a chance.  You owe me an apology now.  You touched me in places I never even oiled.  That's one of our listeners being all zany, Dr. Smith.  It's the robot.  How do you telephiles speak of me in such an ill-muted manner?  We have to bring this to an end, because I have to run.  No!  I still love you.  No, Dr. Smith, please. 
[01:18:00]  Please don't go yet.  Hello?  Now say goodbye like nice boys.  Oh, dear.  Well, Dr. Smith, you've been fascinating.  Good.  I've enjoyed it.  Thank you.  Wonderful interview.  I wish you will.  Please stay in touch.  Let us contact you again, please.  Oh, dear.  All right.  Goodbye.  And good luck.  All right.  Bye.  I don't think he was going to hang up.  That could be the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  There was no...  He's just as big a smartass, so... 
[01:18:30]  I mean, I was thinking he was going to be some old curmudgeon.  He was going to get all pissed off.  But, no, he's cursing.  That was hilarious, man.  You've got to love Dr. Zachary Smith.  Oh, dear.  Dr. Smith is Dr. Smith.  Yes, yes, yes.  People coming in and bowing to Anthony.  Yes, oh, dear.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, man, was that good.  That was good.  He was starting to get pissed at the end.  Yeah.  Oh, look, I have to go now.  I just saw some young boys pedaling past my window. 
[01:19:00]  Woo!  Yes, Sophie and Anthony.  Must go now.  Yes.  The poppers are taking effect on my young lover.  He's opened up like a manhole cover.  Oh, dear.  Couple of amyl nitrate poppers.  And look, I could fall right in.  Loosen the s*** around your anus.  Please.  Oh, dear.  Yes, yes. 
[01:19:30]  You heard it right from Dr. Zachary Smith.  He fagged up the role of Zachary Smith.  I asked him.  Oh, dear.  Come on, William.  We're going to explore a black hole.  Woo!  And leave the brown one.  That was awesome, man.  What a sense of humor on Dr. Smith.  That was awesome.  Yes.  Got to thank Jonathan Harris for calling the show today.  What a guy. 
[01:20:00]  He's 86 years old, by the way.  86 years old.  Yeah.  And I still like the young boy's radio.  You see him say, what's with the hell is money?  That's a lot of fun.  Frickin' Dr. Smith, man.  We thought it was going to suck, but that was really cool, man.  We're going to try to get him to hang up.  You know, kind of lulled him into it at first.  Very easy.  A few things.  Comment on his newer work that he's done.  Sure.  And then a couple of the other cast members are lost in space. 
[01:20:30]  And then right when I went to William, at the minute range,  thinking he was going to hang up.  That was fun.  Bravo to Anthony.  That was hilarious.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Naked Toucher.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge  on The Opie and Anthony Show.  N-E-W. 
[01:21:00]  Corpse Shots Docs in Brooklyn.  A price increase.  EMS paramedics mistakenly pronounced a 77-year-old Brooklyn woman dead,  and it was three hours before anyone noticed the comatose woman was breathing,  and then they rushed her to a hospital, police said yesterday.  Yeah, she was apparently in a coma, but the EMS people thought she was dead.  They actually thought rigor had set in.  Yeah.  And they called the coroner.  He was going to come over there and zip her up in one of those body bags 
[01:21:30]  and ship her off to the mortuary.  She opened her eyes.  How, oh my God.  How big a dump did the coroner take when that happened?  Especially if she said, what are you doing with your fingers?  Oh.  She said, I need a massage.  I thought you passed away.  Wow, look at this story.  The cops entered the apartment on 10th Street,  found Foster lying unconscious in the bathroom.  The EMS guys, they pronounced her dead.  I just couldn't believe it.  After all those hours, she was pronounced dead. 
[01:22:00]  It was unbelievable, said little John Forty, who lives in Queens.  The coroner came, and he checked her out.  She pulled her arm up, and her eyes opened up,  and the coroner said, this woman is alive.  That's why they hire him.  And he has a comment from the coroner that, uh...  Bite as the eyes open.  Ah!  And it said the same thing.  Ah!  Um, Anthony, we got one of the EMS guys on the phone.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he wants to say something, 
[01:22:30]  because he was one of the guys that pronounced her dead, right?  My bad.  Hey, that sounded like our own Tom from New Orleans.  No, that's one of the EMS guys.  Hmm.  Oh, what?  He's got another comment?  Curls my toes like Patty's toenail.  All right?  Well, there you go.  All right.  And, uh, one of the younger EMT, uh, workers,  they had a mic on them, too.  Let's just listen with us.  Yeah.  Well, that's...  That's expected.  Ah. 
[01:23:00]  What is the...  Oh, oh, good.  We do have a clip of the coroner right when the, uh, eyes open.  Sweet, merciful crap.  Wow.  And here's the, uh, here's the body, uh, the, the grandmother.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Well, um, Anthony, here's the coroner.  Okay.  Uh, the first words the coroner said to the lady after, uh, you know,  everyone realized she was alive.  Sure.  Walk it off, Dick.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right. 
[01:23:30]  That's good.  Oh, the coroner talking to the EMS people that, uh, pronounced her death.  What the hell were you thinking?  All right.  Who saw that come?  Oh, we do have the, uh, concerned medical staff.  How are you?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Well, let me just check my carts over here. 
[01:24:00]  That wasn't appropriate.  I think this is the, uh, EMS worker when they found the woman alive.  Well, somebody put this retard out of his misery.  That's not right.  Well, then I got, uh, the EMS guy reacting after seeing the, uh, the, the body that he thought was dead.  Ah.  Hey, who's the stripper?  All right.  Hey, we have an update on the line.  Uh, oh, we do?  A real update, yes.  Oh, jeez.  Andrew. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Hey, I heard that story, too.  Actually, the next day she died in the hospital.  Thanks.  I'll be here all week.  And, uh, we do have her final words before she died.  We're cakes for nothing!  All right.  All right.  Great.  Great.  Great.  Very good.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Okay, yeah.  A moulinian.  Shut up, Tony Soprano.  Stop.  It's not right. 
[01:25:00]  Poor woman.  Is that true?  She said this when, uh, they pulled the breathing tube out?  Mm, stick it in my mouth.  Might have saved her.  One of the, uh, EMS workers talking to the dead corpse.  Huh?  You get nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Sir, ma'am, whatever.  And, uh, her, her in, uh, in heaven, if you can believe it.  We have some afterlife, uh, audio of her.  I'm over here now! 
[01:25:30]  All right.  Well, we got the coroner talking to the family here.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, let truck go broil.  Meet you people, eh?  Well, uh...  Oh, now this isn't appropriate.  Was this what one of the, uh, EMS people was saying watching her lay there?  Doc, that chink a day's pay for napping on the job.  Yes, sir.  Hi.  Um, Anthony.  We got her strilled a bit into the ground?  Uh, we got her first words. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, good.  After they realized she actually was alive.  Great.  How you guys doing?  No, no, no.  Oh, no, that's, that's Tom.  Tom, yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Maybe being dead, uh, you know, makes your voice sound more manly.  I don't know.  You never know.  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Well, we're waiting.  Uh, that, and that's audio of, uh, the listeners, uh, telling us, uh, we're waiting for something else.  Enough.  Maybe something new from, uh, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  We just wasted another five minutes.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Theater of the mindless.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Ah!  A couple minutes of feedback. 
[01:27:00]  Jay from Edison.  Hey, Ann, I see your boy, Timmy Gaywad.  Gaywad.  Uh, won himself a purdy little medal.  Tell us.  Purdy little medal.  Did you spill your Zima as you frolicked about in your tupu?  Stop it.  Well, you must be excited that the Canadians finally got their gold.  Well, uh, yes.  I do believe you started that campaign for everybody.  I, uh, actually did.  I was one of the first to, uh, say that, uh, they should have gotten the gold.  A lot of controversy. 
[01:27:30]  The French figure skating judge has been suspended.  For, uh, buckling under again.  And just like the French, it turns out that all the judges went to this, uh, hotel room.  And the French judge was muscled by the Russian judges to, uh, vote for the Russian.  Muscled.  Yeah, muscled.  They just, they, they, and the French judge, okay, but, yeah, well, let's say, they're all women. 
[01:28:00]  They're all even the men are women.  There's no such thing as redundant French woman.  Redundant.  So, uh, they got her in the hotel room and, uh, yes, I will, uh, give you the vote, uh, for the third figure skating.  And then, uh, in return, the French were supposed to win the ice dancing, which starts up, uh, when is that, Rick?  Do you know when the ice dancing starts?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow, the ice dancing.  Oh, you're going to have a busy weekend, Anthony.  But now the whole controversy is the French were favored for the ice dancing to win, but now it's going to look like, hey, if the French win, now it's just the reciprocation on part of the Russian judges and we're still, uh, screwed. 
[01:28:30]  Ugh.  So, uh, I can't wait for the ice dancing.  So, the, uh, men's single, uh, figure skating last night, the second half or the long program, Opie.  Yeah, you explained the short program and now it's the long program.  And, of course, um, Timothy Gable for the United States was, uh, sitting in third and on a big man junk after the short program. 
[01:29:00]  And then, uh, going into the long program, very exciting last night.  And, uh, he pulled out a bronze medal.  Well, from where?  From where, Rick, it is.  He pulled out a bronze.  So, he got the bronze.  Well, the Russians, uh, won that.  The, uh, Russian guy, I don't remember his name, I don't know.  With the cute blonde hair?  No, he came in second.  He got the silver.  I didn't see that guy skate.  The guy with the blonde mullet. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, the Russian that won is actually, he lives in Connecticut.  He's becoming a U.S. citizen.  So, it's, how, isn't that fascinating, Norton?  Yeah.  But, uh, Timothy Gable, boy, when he finished his, uh, routine and went back and held his little teddy bear waiting for his score.  Right.  Sean has a great observation that I think a lot of us saw last night.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Sean.  Hey, guys, uh, first time in Olympic history that a male figure skater had a wife and kids. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, this was...  Unbelievable.  What is that guy's name?  Why?  But how shocked were you to find out that one of the male figure skaters has a family, a wife?  I was shocked.  See you later, honey.  I'm going to the rink.  Gonna go figure skate with the guys.  Gonna go figure skate.  Because you know what it is.  Bring my cooler beer.  He comes out on the ice, and, uh, they say, yeah, it's his last, uh, Olympics.  He's only 25, but he's, uh, not gonna skate anymore.  He's going back.  He lives in Fairfax, Virginia. 
[01:30:30]  I hear he listens, uh, to WJFK in, uh, Washington.  How about that one?  And, um, he says he's, he's, uh, not gonna be in the Olympics anymore because he wants to spend more time with his children and his wife.  I'm like, stop it.  What?  What?  Actually, he's not gonna skate anymore because he finally figured it out.  It's a gay sport.  After looking around for years, he goes, cheers!  Christ, what the hell am I in?  Hey, being married doesn't mean anything, man.  You ever see Dog Day Afternoon?  You know, he's married.  Oh. 
[01:31:00]  Why do you do this?  You're not dying.  You're killing everyone around you.  You're killing everyone around you.  You guys suck.  Oh, you gotta stop this.  It's craziness.  In Algeria, they run around with a bunch of things on their head.  They're crazy people.  Crazy people.  You thought Wisconsin was a country?  Michael Weiss from Fairfax, Virginia.  So he comes out on the ice.  And, uh, they show his wife.  She's like a blonde, big blonde bombshell type.  And, um, his father. 
[01:31:30]  And he skates out.  And he looks like just some Italian guy.  He's like got the group slicked back hair.  And he goes into the routine.  And I'm like, I even said to my girlfriend, I go, how does a heterosexual guy emote with his body like that?  Like he's dancing on the ice.  He does the arm thing.  You expect it from the gay guys that are figure skating.  You know, they're very artistic.  And their arms are going.  And they're doing all those hand things.  Like, look, I'm grabbing at the sun. 
[01:32:00]  You know, and things like that.  But, it's like, yeah, I expect the guy goes, honey, I thought I signed up for hockey.  I put the skates on.  And, uh, I don't know what happened.  But then he starts his, uh, routine.  And he's just as gay on the ice as the gay guys.  And then he gets done.  And he walks off the ice.  And that's it.  Yeah, pops a beer, I guess.  Was he holding a teddy bear or something?  He wasn't holding the teddy bear.  No, all the gay guys got little, I guess it's their good luck charms when they finish their skating. 
[01:32:30]  And they're sitting on the chair waiting for the marks to come in.  They hold little things like a teddy bear.  One guy had the, uh, the eye from, uh, Monsters, Inc.  You know, that character.  He was holding that very tightly.  Those are just the first gifts they got in the hospital after being beaten by skinheads.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  But he's just like an Italian guy out there.  I'm trying hard.  I, like, you know.  I like the figure skating.  It's a new direction for me. 
[01:33:00]  It's dice on ice.  I was a little disappointed with my performance.  I pulled off the quad.  And then I go into the triple saw cow.  I can only pull off a double.  But I hit the toe loop.  I hit it.  So I'm scared.  Hey, guys, what do you think of my, I went with the gold lame.  I see that dice.  I was going to go with the silver.  But it was a little tacky.  We're watching your performance right now.  It looks good.  You're skating backwards right here. 
[01:33:30]  I'm very proud of this move.  Yeah.  See, it comes up.  I do the spin thing.  Oh, hey.  And now, look.  I jumped over there.  But look where I land.  I'm over here now.  I jump over there.  I land over here now.  But there I am.  Now I'm twirling.  I'm very dainty on the ice.  Most people say I'm a big guy.  I'm dainty on the ice.  It brings out my feminine side.  Look at you reaching for the sun right here.  Now I'm reaching, reaching.  Nice, nice.  And here I go.  Yeah.  Now I go down into the low leg grab spin. 
[01:34:00]  And look at my hair.  My hair's flying like when I call this the head, the dice camel.  Uh-oh.  It was the hammer camel, but now it's mine.  Look at you flying around the ice now.  Now look, I got some speed up.  I go all the way from over there to over here now.  Now I'm in front of the judges.  There's one quad, a triple, and a triple.  Oh!  Oh!  I pulled that off.  Oh! 
[01:34:30]  Bop!  So I'm skating, right?  Yeah.  And his fag wants to put his tongue up my own.  Now I'm going, look at me backwards.  Look, I'm skating backwards.  Look at my hair.  And the costume's good.  I wear a lame leather jacket with dice bedazzled on the back.  Oh!  Well, it's a little weird with the sweatpants, though, dice.  Yeah, well, the sweatpants help.  It helps with the atrodynamics. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, you're slowing it down, though.  Now I slow it down.  Here's where I get dramatic.  Okay, very.  Here I...  Now I'm going for another jump.  I hit that one.  Oh!  The quad!  And now a toe loop.  And now I grab my foot and spin on the ice.  Look at it.  Look at my hair.  I'm handsome out there.  What, do they score for handsome?  Oh, they should.  Now I do something no one else does.  What's that?  I bring midgets out on the ice with me. 
[01:35:30]  Watch me jump the midget.  Oh!  Look at that.  Now I look.  I put my leg on top of the midget, and he's skating like he's my leg.  I bend it to the...  Oh, here we go.  Now I go into an Italian thing.  It's the tarantula song.  Look, look.  I'm skipping on the ice.  You can barely tell I'm wearing skates.  You're running on your toes, I see.  Yeah, the other skaters in the back, they go, oh, Dice, why do you have to be so good at skating? 
[01:36:00]  I go, take the C out of your A, faggot.  Oh!  Now I'm passing by the judges.  A toe loop, a spin.  Give me a perfect score.  Bump the gold medal spine.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, bravo.  Nice finish. 
[01:36:30]  Thank you.  See how I threw my hands up in the air?  Very nice.  That's dainty.  Now wait, I gotta wait for my scores.  You went down on one knee there.  Very nice.  All right.  Look, instead of the stuffed animal, what am I holding?  A midget.  It's in my lap.  A midget.  I wait for my scores.  Uh-huh.  6-0, 6-0.  Dice wins.  Oh!  No controversy there.  The French judge screws me.  I'm gonna plow. 
[01:37:00]  Hey, French judge, suck my banana juice.  It's dice on ice.  I like the dice on ice.  Very good.  Oh!  I'm having trouble with the quad.  Hey, Club Soda Kenny, collect my roses, okay?  Hey, happy face, get my roses.  The people love me.  Out on the ice. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, Timothy Gay Boy.  What's with the hair?  What's with the moosey curly hair?  He don't skate like me.  I'm the best.  And I'm handsome.  See the guy that looks like the lead singer of Def Leppard?  No, that's the blonde guy.  Hey, blondie.  You know one thing?  He skates backwards.  The hair looks beautiful.  It's beautiful.  Oh!  I skate unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I get the gold medal. 
[01:38:00]  Mbop!  Look at my ass in this outfit.  It's gorgeous.  I like the tight ass on it.  I leave the legs loose so I can do my jumps.  And the choreography's gorgeous.  I learned that at Pips when I used to play there in Brooklyn.  Dice, someone wants to know if you're going to consider hair skating.  What, with like a chick?  Yeah, or maybe a little of that ice dance.  What, do I lay her down and put my yam bag in her face?  Oh! 
[01:38:30]  Score me!  I win!  Bop!  And now the finishing move.  Mule juice on the face.  Pinch the helmet.  Pinch the helmet.  Soak I win.  Oh!  Get me another broad.  This one's full of goo.  She can't skate with goo in her eyes.  I banana juiced her eyes shut.  She's skating into the walls.  She looks like a retard.  Oh! 
[01:39:00]  People ask, hey, dice, what are you going to do after the Olympics?  I'm going to go pro.  You're going pro?  I'm skating around for money.  Yeah.  I've got something I've got, I'm working on a thing.  Yeah.  You know the thing?  You're going to help me with the thing?  Are you talking about dicecapades?  The dicecapades!  Like, look at me.  I'm skating with Snoopy.  It's crazy.  Here comes Charlie Brown.  Look, I'm in the cast of Beauty and the Beast.  Hey, Beauty, dump the Beast.  I'll dump a load of goo on you.  Hey! 
[01:39:30]  Dicecapades!  Now it's mine!  Matt has a question for you, uh, Dice on Ice.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I want to know if Dice is going to be the first person in international competition to pull  up the quadruple plow cow.  Ah, nah, nah.  You're not stealing that from me.  People do the sow cow.  No.  I do the plow cow.  I bring a fat, disgusting pig on the ice and I plow her on her back.  The judges love that kind of thing. 
[01:40:00]  I'm just plowing a smack in a fat cans as I, as I gently go down the ice.  People go Dice.  How are you so dainty while you're banging this fat slob?  Oh!  You got some, uh, other moves there, Dice, or what?  Nah, I like the quad.  That's good.  And the toe loop.  Yeah.  That's a fun one.  Uh-huh.  And then I got a new one.  What's that?  It's called the triple boogaloo.  I jump, it's like a quad, but as I jump, I go boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, 
[01:40:30]  I'm over here now.  And when I land, I'm over here now.  I started over there, I land boogaloo, I'm over here now.  Oh!  Kenny, get my flowers.  Why is this full of so many faggots?  Everywhere I turn, another fag.  So catch dice on ice in the dice capades. 
[01:41:00]  And then my big finish after the boogaloo-galoo?  Yeah.  It's to look what I did to you again.  Ow!  Pinch the mule, pinch the mule, pinch the mule, and then the banana juice out of my yam bag.  So much, they got to bring out the zamboni to clear the ice.  Goo all over.  You know that move where you stop short, and the ice goes flying on your skates?  Sure.  I do that in front of the judges with my yam bag juice. 
[01:41:30]  They're covered.  The French judge, like she's covered in strudel.  Ow!  You love it, you pig whore!  All right, dice.  Dice on ice, everyone.  Dice in honor.  Dice on ice!

[01:43:30]  Here is where we really separate the champions from the chumps  Oh my god, that's horrible  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony show  Oh  Oh  Yeah  Alright, I'm upstairs now with the king  Alright, with the king  Yep  Alright, he's in our lobby  We're gonna try to figure out if he's worthy enough to come down and hang with us today, Anthony 
[01:44:00]  Alright  Alright, here he is  Hello  Hey, king  Hello there  Hello  How's it going?  King  King  Yeah  Is this the king?  Yeah  You sound like the king  You hear that voice  Now we got your CD Graveland  Do you like it?  Um  Yeah, it's great  It's quite different 
[01:44:30]  I guess the concept is you're the king singing other people's songs that are dead  Yeah  We played Come As You Are in Sweet Home Alabama on our show already  Thank you  Uh  Getting rave reviews by our listeners  And um  They like it, yeah?  Yeah  Yeah, yeah, that's great  So why imitate the king?  Well, it's someone I have loved and admired since I was seven years old  Do you know why we have you on the phone?  No, why?  We're trying to decide if you're worthy or not to come down here and hang with us 
[01:45:00]  And so far you're not winning the battle  Oh, right  I'm serious  So what else could you give us?  We do several acoustic songs  Yeah  So you're gonna  And answer any questions that you want to have answered  Well, there's not many questions we want to ask an Elvis impersonator  Are you an Elvis impersonator?  Do you dress up like Elvis and stuff? 
[01:45:30]  Well, I wear a black leather costume  Yeah  Similar to the one that Elvis wore in a 60th TV special  You sound very excited  Well, I've been up for 4.30 this morning  I'm exhausted  We had so many plans delayed on us  In Chicago  And it's been a real long day  We're setting up a special studio for you, King  Right  So I'm worthy then  Well, I don't know if you're worthy yet  I think you need some stack or two  Well, here's our plan 
[01:46:00]  Here's our plan  We want you to do a couple  At least one song  From your Gravelands CD  Yeah  But we want you to perform it  In the bathroom here at N.E.W.  Can you do that?  In the bathroom?  In the bathroom  On the potty  We're setting up a microphone and everything  Yeah, we'll have a mic in there for you  On the potty?  Yeah  And headphones and stuff  So, well, you don't have to take your pants down or anything  You've just got to sit on the toilet  No  And play your song 
[01:46:30]  No, I don't want to do that  Why not?  Because I think it's sick  Why is that sick?  Because  I heard there's good acoustics in the bathroom  Because Elvis Presley died in the bathroom  Well, yeah, that's the reason we want to do it  Yeah, that'll give it more of a  The ultimate tribute to the king himself  What do you say?  We'll negotiate this point  We'll plug  They won't need to sing from the bathroom  We'll plug your CD  We'll allow you to play a couple songs  And Elvis died in the bathroom 
[01:47:00]  It's like the king on his throne  And this man  They wanted to talk to me on the phone first  To see was I maybe worthy enough to sign into the studio  Yeah  Yeah  So what do you think?  I'm worthy enough to go to the studio, no problem  But I don't want to sing from the bathroom  Why not?  That'll be neat  We have a mic in there and everything  I'm not going to sit on the toilet and sing  On the toilet and sing?  No  See, no  It doesn't sound like you have much of a sense of humor about you 
[01:47:30]  Are you a funny guy?  A fun guy?  Or are you very serious?  Uh  You're a pretty serious dude  I would say yeah  Yeah  I mean  Having five children  Dude, it's a goof  And a mortgage is pretty serious  It's a goof CD  So we're going to goof around with you  What can I tell you?  It's a goof CD  A goof  Goof  Not good  Goof  It's kind of goofy  Goof?  Goofy?  Goofy  Don't you think?  Yeah  Like it's kind of  Don't you think it's a little weird? 
[01:48:00]  Like I would think you would have this tremendous sense of humor  It's a fun, warm-hearted CD  Um  It was okay  I mean  I thought the music was good  I thought the impersonation  Uh  Needed a little work  But  Well  That's your opinion  You're entitled to it  So what do you say, King?  No  We got the studio set up?  No  It's a great  It's a great room acoustically?  Uh, no  I don't want to sing from the bathroom  Sitting on the toilet  Is that just because you 
[01:48:30]  You would never sing from a bathroom?  It's out of respect for Elvis Presley  Out of respect for Elvis  I think Elvis would be into something like this  No  Come on  We wanted you to, you know  Be naked in there  We'll take that away  So you just have to sit on the toilet  No  I don't want to sit on the toilet  Why not?  I just explained why  What if the lid was down?  Yeah, the lid will be down  I don't care if the lid's down or up  You don't have to like  The cubicle door's open or closed or whatever  You don't have to take a dump when you hit the high notes or something, you know 
[01:49:00]  We're just looking for you to sit on the ball  We'll have a mic in there, headphones  So that's how Elvis Presley died, is it?  I guess that's what they say  That's what they say  But I don't think it was during his performance of a song  Come on, you're an Elvis impersonator  Yeah  You do other people's dead songs  Yeah  So you should have a sense of humor and do this  And then we'll plug the CD and everything  Yeah, but it's not the derogatory humor  It's a...  Hey King, you're making money off other dead artists' work 
[01:49:30]  Right  I'm making money... I haven't made any money  You know, you sing a...  I haven't made any money? How do you know what money I've made?  You sing a Nirvana song, a Leonard Skinner song, a A.C. Jussie song, Jimi Hendrix  Excuse me, you are making money off other dead people's work by playing the records on your radio station  Yeah, and we'll spin records from the bathroom too  Yeah, James Cameron made the film Titanic  So you want to start accusing him of making money off people dead  Oh, we hit a soft spot, I believe 
[01:50:00]  We're not accusing you of anything  All we're saying is...  We're just saying if you're going to sing other people's songs that are dead  That you should have a sense of humor to perform them on the toilet  As Elvis  No  As Elvis  No  Elvis died on the toilet, get it?  No  Are you like in love with Elvis?  I've explained that I don't want to...  No, are you like...  ... sit on the toilet and sing out of respect for the memory of Elvis  Are you in love with Elvis? Is that it? Like you have this love for him?  Yeah, fraternal love  Anything wrong with that?  Of paternal love?  Anything wrong with the paternal love?  Or have you found a way to make money off his name? 
[01:50:30]  What?  Just asking  Elvis seemed to have had a sense of humor  Yeah, he had a wonderful sense of humor, great sense of humor  Yeah, and that's kind of a weird sense of humor thing to perform one of the songs sitting on the toilet  No  No?  So what do you say, King?  I've already told you about 20 times  I thought we could talk you into it  What?  I thought we could talk you into it  No  See, I guess you didn't really know much about our show then, huh? 
[01:51:00]  No  We have every artist that ever comes into Opie and Anthony's studio performs from the bathroom  That's right  No  And it's just a coincidence that Elvis died on the toilet  We didn't even take that into consideration, but...  No  It is kind of the way it's set up  Well, alright, so your final answer is no?  Mm-hmm  Okay  I guess we could play your CD from here then  Well, it's up to you  Alright, would you like me to...  Would you like to hear me play it?  But I would like to go into the studio where you are and perform the songs 
[01:51:30]  Well, no, no, the deal is...  We can't do that  The deal is you perform from the bathroom or that's it?  No  Alright, well then I'll play your CD here in the studio  Why can't you let me go into the studio and perform the songs like?  Because it's much more fun if you do it in the bathroom  Yeah  No  No?  You sound intense, man  What?  You sound like you're going to cry or something  You alright?  Yeah, I'm on fire  You sound intense 
[01:52:00]  Alright, um...  Do you ever lighten up or loosen up or laugh or something?  Sometimes  Yeah, not now  Don't have a sense of humor, huh?  It doesn't sound like, uh...  Alright, well, would you like to listen as I play your CD here in the studio?  Yeah, go ahead  Alright, here we go  Did you hear that? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah  Alright  Alright, King  There's pieces of CD all over the studio  Well, do you think you're the one that has to clean it up?  Yeah, that's alright, though  It was worth it  Alright, man, have a great weekend  I will 
[01:53:00]  Alright  See ya  Bye-bye  Oh, my God  I don't think that step was necessary, Opie  What?  I understand he wasn't going to sing from the bathroom  But...  Now, Rick's got to go deal with this  Why is everyone leaving me? 
[01:53:30]  I don't know  I think you were a little harsh  Nah, he was being rude to us, too, man  Alright, we gotta take a break  I thought he was going to sing from the bathroom  I swear to God  I thought we were going to get him to sing from the bathroom  Well  That would have been fun, right?  Yeah  What was the big deal?  He seemed to not want to do it because of Elvis  Elvis died on the toilet  Alright  So, out of his love for Elvis  What happened?  I thought we were just having fun 
[01:54:00]  You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now  The opening and the show  Thank you  N-E-W  Go ahead, Keith  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, well, you're saying how horrible it's to see your mom's boobs  Yeah, if you inadvertently see your mom's boobs, what?  Seeing your mom and dad do commando on the bed  Commando?  What happened, Keith?  Oh, God  I try to forget it  Well, what happened?  You walked in on him? 
[01:54:30]  Oh, yeah  Early Saturday morning  You opened  You just flung the door open?  Opened it  Was mom taking it from behind or what?  Oh, my God  Yeah, what was happening?  Yeah, what position were they in, Keith?  Feet over the shoulders  Woo!  Wow!  That's the hi, how you doing?  Hello  Is your dad hung?  Huh?  Oh  Is your dad hung?  I don't know  But, like, were they making noise or anything? 
[01:55:00]  It was pretty embarrassing, huh?  I think my mom's a professional  She was moaning, huh?  Yeah, I guess, yeah  Yeah, that's pretty bad  And then what happened when they saw you?  Well, their back was kind of facing to me  So I managed to get out  Oh, they didn't see you?  They didn't ask you to join them?  Oh  Oh, God  Oh, man, you got  Who are you, Rick, today?  Taking it too far?  I took a hit on the head this morning  And I'm terrible  Think I'm spaz? 
[01:55:30]  Hey, this kid's quick  Even 12-year-olds can go on spaz  So did you enjoy it?  I mean  Was that the first time you ever seen, you know, people having sex?  Yeah, I guess  Oh, man  Has your dad told you about the birds and the bees yet?  Actually, my brother did  What did he tell you?  Well, it started with this question  What hole did he go into?  My father said  Whatever one's open  Oh, my God 
[01:56:00]  Is your dad's name Jackie?  No, not that one  Oh, my God  That's funny  Keith, you're all right, man  I guess you'll do okay  All right  Anything else?

[01:57:00]  I mean, I was unaware of that  But it reminded me of  First of all  They deserve whatever they get  Because they never leave us alone  And we try to barricade our room  And if that doesn't work  They hear the bed squeaking  They take a broom handle  And bang on the living room ceiling  It's a clue I've been  Yes  And, uh, but, um  What I wanted to say was  It reminded me  When I heard him on the radio  Your voice sounds a little hoarse

[01:58:00]  Right, double door  And, uh  We're having, like, a final time up there  And all of a sudden  The kids, I didn't know  They were playing hide and seek  So was your husband  Hide the salami  No, we were  Yeah, we're not  That way  Seat the meat  Oh, my God  Listen to her voice  And we're both pretty big people, you know  Oh, boy  Oh, my God  Oh, boy  Also, poor Keith saw two fat people having sex 
[01:58:30]  Oh, yeah  You know, like, is it in?  Listen to her  Now we know where your son gets his chops from  I know  There's one good thing  It's a comedic family here  Okay, go ahead  So, we're up there  And all of a sudden  The door  My nephew  Hit the bedroom door  So hard  That the closet door  Swung shut  The bedroom door opened  And there he was  Well, my husband

[02:00:00]  I felt like I had to say something to my nephew  You know  All of a sudden  The kid had to hanker in for some Arby's roast beef sandwich  Yeah, well, no  I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable  I just sat downstairs  I pointed my finger in his face  And I just  I said  I hope you have nightmares  For the rest of your life  I will  What's coming off of that finger  How much  How much does mom and dad weigh?

What?  Same kid dropped out of high school  Well, that probably affected him 
[02:03:00]  He was traumatized  Yeah  How old is your mom?  She's around 46  Yeah, and they're still going at it, huh?  Oh, yeah  How about that?  It seems like you guys catch them having sex a lot  According to her  Yeah  Yeah  They try locking the door with the closet  It doesn't work, huh?  Put a chair up against the doorknob  Yeah  They make these things called locks, Keith  Yeah, really  What about a lock?  My brother has one

All right  All right  Bye  Bye, there he goes  The Keith family  The Keith family  The Alty and Anthony show  Because it's, uh  It's kind of a special song  It's not on the CD because it sucks?  Well  That would seem to follow, wouldn't it?  Okay  No, it's actually not  It's not a very funny song  It's, uh  Uh-oh  If you don't mind 
[02:04:30]  My wife and I were recently divorced  You're 12  I know  You're 12  Short marriage  Okay  Okay  How old are you?  I'm 27  27?  All right  Yeah  And, uh  My wife of 16 years, Erin  Divorced recently  And we have a little six-year-old girl  And, uh  She doesn't really understand  Why mommy isn't living with us anymore  And I did my best to write this little lullaby  And perhaps explain it to her 
[02:05:00]  I like this set up  This is great  Thanks  Okay  I'm going to bring it down a little bit here  Hush, little girl  Sweet, sweet baby  Don't cry  Tonight  Daddy's here  And he'll sing you a soft lullaby  Tonight 
[02:05:30]  Why can't it all be like it was before?  How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore?  Cause daddy likes porno and ten-dollar whores  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores 
[02:06:00]  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus  I think that's why your mommy left us  I think that's why your mommy left us  Pretty  Hush, little girl  There is no reason to fret  Tonight  Don't mind the smoke 
[02:06:30]  Don't mind the smoke  Daddy just wants to forget  Tonight  Soon  It will all be like it was  Before  Any minute  Any minute  She will walk through  That front door  But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer 
[02:07:00]  Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear  Daddy has sores on his genitals  I think that's why your mommy left us  I think that's why your mommy left us  Please don't cry  I swear I'll try  To be here by your side 
[02:07:30]  Right after daddy gets home from the bar  Visits his bookie and steals a new car  He'll drive to the strip club  And if daddy plays his cards right  He'll bring home your new mommy tonight  Look at me 
[02:08:00]  I'm all teared up now  I'm welling up with tears  Hey, even Dice is tearing up over there  Yeah, you got me, huh?  You got my sensitive side  The Opie and Anthony Show  It's a squid 
[02:08:30]  It's a big squid  It's a big squid  Coming soon  The return of the 55-gallon drum challenge  On the Opie and Anthony Show  And E-W  Alright, I want to welcome back all our affiliates  To the O and A Show  You'll never hear that  Just practicing 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, for nothing  Want to say hi to our new audience in Dallas  Dallas, Texas  Check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show  Hello, Dallas  Are all our affiliates back on the network?  Just got our ratings from Detroit  Thank you to everyone in Detroit  Making us number one  It sounds ridiculous  It'll never happen  Please  And let's not forget Washington 
[02:09:30]  Yeah  No, it's just us in New York  That's it  Alright, Ant  Yeah  Now let's get to the reason why we call Spazin  Well, he was talking about his birthday  Which was yesterday, I guess  And he stayed in the city  What night?  Monday  Monday night  He stayed in the city  Stayed in the big city  Figured you'd splurge for your birthday, right? 
[02:10:00]  Yes  You and Eric, I presume?  Yes  Erica and Spaz stayed in the city  Mm-hmm  Stop looking at me, man  Jesus  Now I'm paranoid  Christ  Want me to stop smiling, too?  Spaz, call my family  They'll let you in on a few things about me  I have a barrier like Anthony  That's why him and I get along  Yep  We don't like people getting too close  And we know how far not to go  Right  With the barrier  It's simple 
[02:10:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Everything okay?  You know  Got a problem in life  Jesus  It's just like  Dude, what's up?  And you know  Oh, my God  B.S. or this B.S.  And then you move on  Alright  But we don't even get that far talking about things  Well, maybe some days, Spaz  Anyway, let's get back to your birthday  You spent it in the city Monday  Yes, city  Now, with your lovely girlfriend, Erica  Erica  Very surprised she's still with you  After the stuff you've pulled on her  But that's okay  She gave you another chance, right? 
[02:11:00]  Yes  Very good  Alright  So now, Opie  Let's say you're working at a radio station  It's your entry-level position into the biz  So it probably doesn't pay all that much  I made less than Spaz  Yeah  At my first radio job  This is officially Spaz's first radio job  Yeah, now, well, you've got to take into consideration the cost of living  And the things go up  The pay rate has gone up  And it was the early 70s  Yeah, right? 
[02:11:30]  So on an even basis  It's probably comparable to what you were making  Yeah, that's fair enough  Sure  So if you were going to stay in Manhattan  You would probably really shop around for a hotel  Because it's very hard to stay in Manhattan  For under a couple of hundred bucks  In a room  It doesn't matter where you stay  You're going to  If you could get a rate of 150  Oh my God, you're lucky  And I would be all over Priceline  Yeah  And I would panic if it was anything more than $200 
[02:12:00]  I would panic  But it's my birthday  I'm with my new girlfriend  Because Erica's kind of like a new girl with Spaz  Seven months  Seven months  It's relatively new  Uh-huh  I'd splurge and go  Okay, I think I could  I could swing about $200  Two bills  No more  No less  Right  That would get you what?  Howard Johnson's  Something  Something  The 11th Ave  The Holiday Inn  Holiday Inn maybe  Midtown maybe  Something  Days Inn  Something nice  You know  But you're not fleabag 
[02:12:30]  But you're not talking the four-star luxury  Right  Hotel  Okay  Anyone want a hazard to guess  Which hotel Spaz chose to stay at?  Oh no  It's  Spaz  How many stars?  Four-star hotel?  Dude  Dude  Hold up another finger  They go up to five  Yeah  A five-star hotel?  Yeah  What are you, nuts?  What, Ben?  I think after the four seasons  This is rated the  The top hotel 
[02:13:00]  In Manhattan  Dude, he stayed at the St. Regis  Oh my God  Oh my goodness  Jesus  Like, would you ever dream of walking in there?  Unless it was a freebie for a promotional thing or something?  Alright, Spaz, let me tell you something  Ed and I are doing  We're doing pretty well these days  Not great  Still underpaid  I wouldn't spend a night there  I don't have the money for that  I'm Diamond Spaz Brady  The St. Regis?  St. Regis 
[02:13:30]  Stayed at the St. Regis  Now, this is great  This is great  Did you have a doorman and everything?  Did he bring your bag?  I had a butler  Oh my goodness  They assigned a personal butler to each room  Jeeves  Yes, Jeeves  A personal butler  So, Adrian  Yeah  Jeeves  Jeeves  Could you get the car  Give me a ride around the park  You know how I love the park  This guy's Arthur now 
[02:14:00]  All of a sudden  I think I would like to take a bath  I'll alert the media  All right, Spaz  So, you figured you were splurging  Yes  Did you have any idea how much this was going to cost?  No, see, I called to the Pennsylvania and the Peninsula Hotel  But I couldn't get a reservation  So, I only knew of the St. Regis  So, you just called and said, I need it for Monday night  Didn't ask the cost or anything, right? 
[02:14:30]  I did ask the cost  But I thought that the amount that they gave me was the standard price for a room  And how much was the amount they gave you on the phone?  They gave me on the phone six and a quarter  But it was more than that  Oh, my God!  Dude, dude, dude  If you even want to go  If you even want to go a little higher end for a hotel  Instead of like the Holiday Inn or the Days Inn or something like that  There's the Novotel  Which is like an upper end  The Sheridan  The Parker Meridian  The Park Central 
[02:15:00]  Which is right  The Park Central  These are all hotels based in the $200 frame  $200 to $300 frame  $600 and what?  $25  $6.25 for a room with a personal butler  What did the butler do for you?  Give me the whole butler's whole little schedule  He could have gotten a great set of pots for that price  Yeah, right, Rick?  Hold on  So you...  I'm stammering like Spaz now  So bad!  You're so stupid! 
[02:15:30]  So did you pull up to the St. Regis?  Actually, we walked from Grand Central  Walking from Grand Central  To the St. Regis  At least get your woman like a cab ride or something  Get her a limo!  A limo!  With a duffel bag  It was funny though  They were all like didn't want to let me in at first  Because I was wearing my heavy metal T-shirt with my torn jeans  And my legendary  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  And I...  Okay  So... 
[02:16:00]  That was a little wet  This is great  Alright, so then you...  I wanna...  I gotta know what the butler did  Before we forget  He pressed my clothes  He pressed your heavy metal concert T-shirt  He ironed your clothes?  He ironed my clothes?  Did he iron your underwear and everything?  No, just my pants  He ironed your clothes  And was it the heavy metal T-shirt or something else?  Yes, it was the heavy metal T-shirt  And the shirt that I wore to Pozzano's later that night  Yes  Your heavy metal T-shirt is done, sir 
[02:16:30]  Would you like the creases down the side, sir?  Sorry  Sorry  I seem to have put the crease in the wrong spot  You know  You know  Now it's bad  Did you indulge in any room service?  Uh, no  No!  But I did  Being thrifty  But I did tackle the alcohol bar 
[02:17:00]  Oh, the mini bar in the wrong  Now, those things, I suppose, are very expensive  I didn't know that  What do you mean you didn't know?  Well, I found the bar menu after I partook in the alcohol bar  Wait, you thought it was like a comp?  Like it was free?  Yes  There were $600 and some odd dollars for a room  You figured that the alcohol was free?  And alcohol to get you over the bill  And the Rice Krispie bar and the candy bar  And so how much was your mini bar, Bill?  Well, they added everything all together for a grand total 
[02:17:30]  Of what?  Of $743  He spent $743 for a night  Do you realize that's a month's pay?  That's like rent  That's easily a month's pay for you  Yeah, but I didn't pay it by cash  Oh, you used your credit card?  I just got a credit card  Oh my God!  I just got it like five days ago  Oh no!  Is this your first credit card?  My very first 
[02:18:00]  Oh my God!  Do you know what this is?  Give me your credit card  I'm going to do you a favor  Rip it up right now  I'm going to cut it in half  But that's not  Well, there's a lot more than $743 spent on it right now  What's your maximum?  What's your limit on the card?  $5,500  $5,500  How much do you have on it already?  How much do I spend on it?  Yeah, how much is already  Have you spent on it?  Two grand  And you got it how long ago?  Five days ago  Five days  He spent it  Dude, you are on the slippery slope 
[02:18:30]  Of credit card debt  Your pal Anthony can tell you all about this  Point in my life  When I had a crappy job  I had three credit cards  And about $20,000 in credit card debt  It took me three years  Of doing radio up in Boston  Making more than I was making in construction  But it took me three years  To pay off the card  To pay it off  And making a real effort 
[02:19:00]  I mean throwing every spare dime I had  At the credit card bill  And I was making pretty good money  Now you're making entry level money  Yes  In five days you have cut your credit limit in half on this card  You're probably going to go out  And do the other half within a week  No, I'm going to hide it on myself  It doesn't work  What else did you buy?  Well, I'm wearing part of it now  The shirt and jeans that I'm wearing now  Yeah?  That I spent  I've got it all  Good price at Old Navy 
[02:19:30]  Ah, good price at Old Navy  Yes  And then what else?  Any other splurges?  Dinner?  Yes, Paisanos  Ah, Paisanos  That's free  We ate free there  The tip, though  You put the tip on the credit card?  You put the tip on the credit card?  All right, Spaz  Now I've got to ask you this one, too  Cash advance?  No, no cash  I haven't got my pin code for that yet  Oh, but when you get your pin number  Do you know how much interest is on the cash advance?  No clue  Do you know how much interest you're paying on this card?  I believe 12.9  But I didn't read the paperwork yet 
[02:20:00]  It's probably 12.9 for the first three months  And then it goes up to like 19, I would say  Yeah, 19  And then cash advance is closer to 25%  So, I mean, your minimum payment could be like 80 bucks  Out of that 80, 10 of it will go towards paying off your debt  And 70, they pocket as interest  Wow  It's amazing  And, Spaz, it never ends  Because you know what happens?  When you get done chalking this up  They'll send you more 
[02:20:30]  And you will use them  I know you  I did the same thing  And you know something?  To this day, after I paid it all off  I do not own a credit card  I have an American Express card  That gets paid off at the end of the month  And that is  Credit cards are so friggin' dangerous, Spaz  Especially at your age  At your pay rate  And you seem like you're getting a little irresponsible here  Five days, two grand  How do you  How could you pay off  Oh my god  At the St. Regis  Seven hundred and forty bucks 
[02:21:00]  Seven hundred and forty three bucks  For one night  How long were you in your room?  Spaz, Trump  Not counting sleeping  Well, I was kind of angry  I fell asleep at like eleven o'clock  And then you woke up  A couple hours  Time to check out  A couple hours tops  Because I was in Manhattan just shopping  So you fell asleep eleven at night  Yeah  And you woke up when?  I woke up at about two hours before checkout  So he  Oh my gosh  He spent the night in a bed  So you checked in for seven hundred and forty three bucks 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, then left the zoo shopping  What time did you check in?  I checked in at two o'clock  Okay, two o'clock  He's getting his money's worth  So, but you were out of the room until you came back when?  I was out of the room until nine  Nine at night  So two hours  He's what?  You're watching TV?  Yes  Did you rent any of the movies?  No, just watching TV  Just watching TV  Two hours later  He's out  Yes  Did you bang in the room?  All right  That's not information  I'm just thinking for that kind of cash 
[02:22:00]  And two hours you're in the room  You better have had a really good time  It's personal information  Oh, okay  All right  So you banged her  All right  So  So  Seven  Hundred and forty bucks  Go on your credit card for one night  Yes  Was it worth it?  Do you wish you would have stayed at a different place  Maybe without the butler?  I mean the butler  A butler  Opie, have you ever stayed in a hotel with a butler?  No, and I don't want to  No  That's the funny part  I have no desire to be that fancy 
[02:22:30]  Opie, be  But the place is great though  Yeah  The setup is wonderful  It's wonderful  Yeah, I bet  This just in from Stone Sea from Jersey  Tell Spaz to hide his credit card in the same place he puts his brain  That way he'll never find it  Spaz, did you lie on your credit card application about how much you actually make?  No, I didn't  You didn't pad the number just a little to the high side  To get that $5,500 credit limit?  Well, it's part of an exclusive academic club 
[02:23:00]  Wait a minute  What exclusive academic club is this?  It's called Who's Who  You have a Who's Who credit card?  Yeah, it's for those who have achieved academic accomplishments  Wait  You're one of those Who's Who people?  Yeah  But wait a minute  Are you in a Who's Who book?  Yes  Academic accomplishment  What did you have to write down?  That was your academic accomplishment  No, but I 
[02:23:30]  No, they submitted my name to be in the Who's Who club  Iona College submitted my name  How much did it cost you?  I don't remember  To get in  I really don't remember  But I'm a part of this  And I'm in their yearbook  So they send you a credit card based on your Who's Who status?  Yes  With a $5,500 credit limit?  Yes  Of which you've burned $2,000 already?  Yes  Yes  Ladies and gentlemen  Lifestyles of the incredibly stupid 
[02:24:00]  Today we delve into the life of spaz  You may have heard this term before  But it really applies to spaz  Nigger rich  Spaz  Making in the tens of dollars working at any W  Spending it like a drunken sailor  Look at his room here at the St. Regis 
[02:24:30]  Him and his lovely girl Erica have a personal butler  To iron his heavy metal t-shirts  Here he is whisking his lovely lady away  On a train at Grand Central Station  Where they will walk 50 blocks  To the beautiful St. Regis Hotel  Costing more money than he sees in a year 
[02:25:00]  All chalked up on his Who's Who credit card  As we speak  Spaz is over his limit  After a fancy dinner at Paisano's  Which Spaz gets for absolutely free  He generously tips the waiter  On his new credit card  What a pain in the ass for the waiter  Who now has to claim it on his taxes  Spaz, you dumb prick 
[02:25:30]  Lifestyles of the incredibly stupid  Here he is wearing the St. Regis robe  Which he took home  And there charged him an additional $500  Did you wear the robes, Spaz?  No  And the slippers?  I wore the slippers 
[02:26:00]  They were very comfortable  Those tacked another $85 on his bill  Let's delve into the mini bar  Living like Spaz  On a diet of Rice Krispie treats  Spaz and Chivas  Dining like the stars  Spaz, how did that $25 Snickers bar take? 
[02:26:30]  Spaz, come to think of it  I want to be your friend now  Spaz is buying dinner tonight  Spaz is buying dinner tonight  This just in from Juan from Queens Village  Hey Spaz, the butler wants you to call him  Because he felt withdrawn from you  Hey Opie, with all the money Spaz has  Maybe he could buy a nice strapless dress  To wear for your date tonight  Champagne wishes  And ravioli dreams  Raviolios 
[02:27:00]  Spaz, for one evening out on the town  At the St. Regis  Able to get away from his normal diet  Of weenies and beans  For room service at the St. Regis  Here he is being greeted by the doorman  That won't even let him in  Until he gives a reservation number  What a tool 
[02:27:30]  Here he is  Spaz Rockwell  Who wants to stay at the St. Regis  With a guy that's acting like a millionaire  Spaz has about $3,000 left 
[02:28:00]  Maybe what, $3,500?  We have another three days of Spaz acting like Donald Trump  Here's Spaz writing out his check for 25% interest  Spaz Fernando on line 9 says  You could have went to Cancun for a week on that money  Yeah  Oh man  If you're going to spend the money  You might as well, like  If I could treat myself  Here comes the repo man to Spaz's pad 
[02:28:30]  To repossess his brand new old navy clothes  Spaz, you could star in the remake of The Jerk  With Steve Martin  Wow  He could, right?  Spaz, you are going to go through that credit card so fast  Hiding it won't count matter either  Why?  Because you hide it  And then you just go  I'll just use it for this one thing  And then before you know it  No more credit limit  You're left with the bills  Nothing to show for it 
[02:29:00]  What else?  Somebody wants to know  They did the math  There's $1,300  That you have spent on this thing  Other than your St. Regis stay  Yes  What did you spend it on?  It couldn't be $1,300 in dinner at Paisano's and clothes  No  There's another big charge on there, isn't there?  No  Did you buy some form of electronics?  Yes  What did you buy, Spaz?  Okay, I purchased stuff to upgrade my computer system  Okay  I bought computer games  I bought PlayStation games 
[02:29:30]  I bought a $200 pair of boots  $200 boots!  Wonderful!  Here's Spaz lounging in his Spaz pad  In his $200 boots  Playing his brand new PlayStation game  Oh, look at that  Bill's just pouring in  But Spaz doesn't care  He works at NEW  Look at the lovely beanbag chair

Central Park, Wes?  No  A luxurious townhouse!  I figured I could stay there for three hours  The rent, I haven't figured out  I could stay there three hours  It's great  It's overlooking the park  It's beautiful 
[02:30:30]  Oh, I'm evicted already  In the time it took me to say that  Oh, my God  So you spent all that money revamping your computer  And how much did all that equipment cost you?  That equipment cost me about $500  Yeah  Okay, five beans there  Yeah, $200 for the boots  And then two for the boots  Yeah, some new clothes  Some new clothes  Did you buy anything for Erica?  Yes, I did  I bought her a nice outfit  And some other things she needed  Yeah  Okay, good  All right  In Spaz's defense  Because a bunch of people are calling 
[02:31:00]  They're saying  Hey, man, everyone has done this  When they first get that credit card  Yeah  We have  I mean, that's why  I totally went  I never had the balls to, like, spend $743 one night in a hotel  When I first got my credit card  Dude, I was dumber  Get this  Me working on my Tin Knocker salary  They sent me a credit card with an $8,000 credit limit  Oh  $8,000  I'm rich  Now, did I piss it away?  No  But did I do something incredibly stupid? 
[02:31:30]  Yes  What did Anthony buy?  What'd you do?  I bought a C-Doo jet ski  Oh, that's right  On a credit card  I remember the jet ski  I laid out that thing  Wham!  But I had three of the best summers of my life  And I was able to sell it after I was done  Kept it in good condition  Paid interest up the ass for it  But, you know, I was able to sell it for something  Not like, you know, if you piss it away  Oh, my God  On dinners and things like that  Which I also have done  Don't get me wrong  I mean, I was incredibly stupid  Tips to the waiters at Paisano 
[02:32:00]  Instead of cash  Oh, dude  I gotta ask you  Did you tip the butler?  Uh, yes I did  Not only credit card, though  I gave him cash  I slipped him a one  I gave him a dead president  Mr. George Washington  I said  No, I said, like, come here  Let me take care of you  Let me take care of you  And how much did you give him?

A lot of Tom's calling us today  Dude, in the paperwork  You guys were just talking about Char Jones, right?  Star Jones was down in Philly 
[02:38:30]  For the All-Star weekend there, yeah  Dude, it was  I'll tell you what  I've never seen so many black people in my life  Did you know those black people in Vermont?  What are you talking about?  Dude, racing plates  Vermont, Rhode Island  That's all they drive  Is those SUVs  The escalators  And excursions and all that  Escalators  Dude, it said  I just read the paper today  It said  Char Jones was at Pat's  Or Gino's Steaks  At 3 o'clock in the morning on Saturday  Underneath it said  She rooted it two or three more times  In the next two hours 
[02:39:00]  Can we confirm that?  Not really  Was it in the paper?  You look at her  It's the only confirmation I need  I'm hungry  Boy, I just ate  And worked up quite an appetite  So Star Jones on The View this morning  Yeah  She's talking about her All-Star weekend  Down there in Philly  Oh, how was that?  Was she talking about how like  Everyone was thinking she was hot?  No  Ugh  She was pretty much talking about how  How she got to hang with all the important people  There was Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier over there 
[02:39:30]  Well, that's the two  I watched once and I think they were talking about Denzel Washington or something  And the other women on the show were so condescending  Because Star Jones was like  And then I met Denzel  And they're like  Oh, well, anything happened?  Was there anything?  No, no  You know, I was trying  Do any of those dopey broads actually think Denzel Washington is going to take a shot at Star Jones?  Maybe Denzel's the chubby chaser, Ann? 
[02:40:00]  You don't know  I wouldn't think so  Fat people need loving too  I think there's plenty of chicks in line on Denzel's shortlist  Before Star Jones  The chubby ones  But that's just it  Like it doesn't matter who they're talking about  They could be talking about some other guy  And Star Jones that met him  And then they all go  Barbara Walters  And the one  What's the comic's name there?  Norton, you know  Joy Behar  Joy Behar  They'll all go  Oh yeah, Annie Sparks  There was sparks flying off her jaw 
[02:40:30]  When she was eating  Like a wood chipper  That had a board with a nail in it  It's the only sparks coming off of Star Jones  And they talk to her  Like no one is watching going  Get out of here  Like Billy Dee Williams  Is going to go up to her  Or any of the other guys that she hooks up with  Oh yeah?  Anything happen?  I don't know  I was eating  Food flying in front of my eyes  I couldn't tell if he was looking at me  With love in his eyes  So did you see Michael Jordan? 
[02:41:00]  Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm  Any sparks happening?  Mm-mm  I'd love to get with that  Yeah, I'd love to get with that  Yeah  I wear the shoes  It's all in the shoes  I put the shoes on  I can run through the buffet  Like faster than ever  He can dunk my basket  Oh  Jesus  Who's crapping who here?  He can dunk my basket with some dinner rolls  Because it's just cute for fat girls to be  You know, just joking about the boys 
[02:41:30]  And it would be actually interesting  If someone just put their head through a curtain  And went  Shut up you fat pig  And then the curtain closed again  So  She's delusional  And they set it up  It's such a politically correct program  Because she does all the spots on the beauty  And the pampering  Pampering?  She needs for pampering?  I saw the blacksmith used to come and pamper my horse the same way  They pull the old shoes off  Put the new ones on  Well 
[02:42:00]  She's talking about how she went to a day spa  And  Ah, we didn't do a day spa  While she was down there for All-Star Weekend  Day spa  And the look of horror on those poor bastards' faces  Must be like the pit crew from Daytona working on Star Jones  Do my nails  I need these talons to pick up small game on the way home  I use my good eyesight to find the rodent  And then I swoop down on them  Grab them with the talons  Eat them in one bite 
[02:42:30]  Ooh, that's good  So she had a sign of form at this day spa  They call it a day spa  Because it took all day for them to shove my fat ass through the door  I'm Star Jones  I'm a diva  So she had to sign a form at this day spa  Sign a form  Acknowledging that she was going to get a one hour non-sexual massage  What?  She had to sign something that said that?  Yeah  Non-sexual massage  Well, a lot of these places get in trouble for the digit thing 
[02:43:00]  Oh, I can see that  Oh, dude, even that chink wouldn't have touched her  She's awful  So she's signing a form acknowledging she's getting a non-sexual massage  No touching  Come on, give me the happy ending  For her, a happy ending is cheesecake shoved into a mouth  David, what's up?  Oh, this is a happy ending  David  Hey, listen 
[02:43:30]  Yeah  That was no day spa  That was a car wash  I like when the bubbly rags come and brush on me  That's good  I like going to ones with the Mexicans  That climb up on the ladders to get my top  A car wash  Pampering  And then she also says  You know, I'm not only a diva  I'm a lawyer, too  So I'm smart  So shut up  Like she's got this whole image  That all the other girls on the show 
[02:44:00]  All the girls  Yeah  On the show just perpetuate  And it's not  It's not real  If that woman wasn't on  That TV show  She'd be mocked  As she walked down the sidewalk  Look at this, man  YSP  Right on  Right on top of it, man  We were talking about the little story that appeared in the paper  Al Roker without junk  That's what  And a wig  And I'm not even sure  And a wig  And a wig, yeah  Because she wears a wig  You know what?  I've never seen those two people in the same place  There's another thing  She would talk about a wig  Because she comes in with these wacky hairstyles all the time
