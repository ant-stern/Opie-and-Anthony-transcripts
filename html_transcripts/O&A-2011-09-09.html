<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the upcoming 10th anniversary of 9/11.  Opie and Anthony declared they wouldn't be doing a special show, contrasting their approach with other radio programs like Ron and Fez, who were planning extensive anniversary coverage featuring former staff members Earl Douglas and Billy Staples. They satirized the increasingly somber tone and attire adopted by TV news anchors in anticipation of the anniversary.  A substantial portion of the show focused on Earl Douglas, now the "vibe manager" at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  The hosts, incredulous about his job title, called Hard Rock Johnny, who confirmed Earl's position but couldn't clearly define his duties.  They also joked about a nude photoshoot featuring Earl.

The conversation then shifted to President Obama's jobs bill, with Opie expressing strong disapproval and criticizing "pork barreling." This led to a discussion with a caller about the origins of pork barreling, with the hosts jokingly suggesting a connection to slavery.  The hosts' general disdain for Obama, comments about Al Sharpton's presence on MSNBC, and their cynical views on the political climate followed.

The next segment featured Rich Voss, in studio, detailing the recent fire that destroyed his condo. He recounted the events, his girlfriend Bonnie's delayed response, his own actions during a comedy show, and the frustrating investigation, peppered with humorous anecdotes, including a slideshow presentation of his life and career.  The hosts interjected with sarcastic comments and jokes. Voss speculated humorously on the fire's cause, while the hosts made crude jokes about John Boehner. A humorous song about a lazy radio personality was also played.  A trailer for Jim Brewer's documentary, "More Than Me," was shown, and it was mentioned that Jim Brewer would be joining the show later.

Voss's condo fire discussion continued, detailing the insurance company's investigation, unauthorized entry, and attempts to blame him despite his being 3,000 miles away.  He discussed the damage and the inconvenience of living in a hotel, using considerable profanity.  Darkly humorous speculation about the fire's cause involving his wife Bonnie and daughter followed.  Vossâ€™s upcoming shows and a potential "Cribs"-style video tour of the damaged condo were discussed.

Jim Brewer then joined the show, recounting a harrowing story about his elderly parents, focusing on his mother's physical and emotional abuse of his ailing father.  Brewer described his mother's assaults, manipulative finances, and the difficulties of navigating the assisted living system.  His account, delivered with frustration, disbelief, and dark humor, was quite graphic.

A phone call to Brewer's mother followed, framed as a prank with Opie as "William Tetley" and Anthony as a therapist.  Brewer's mother denied the abuse, citing memory loss, stress, and past trauma. The conversation was intense and emotional, revealing a complex family history. Brewer's documentary, "More Than Me," was again promoted.

The final segment featured Brewer discussing his legal battle with his "Pizza Man," a man who harassed his wife and child, leading to a confrontation involving homophobic slurs from Brewer.  Brewer detailed upcoming court dates and recounted his successful European stand-up tour with Steve-O.  The show then shifted to planning a future "Moms" themed episode, inspired by Brewer's stories and the hosts' own mothers' eccentricities.  The segment concluded with the selection of finalists for a "Win a Date with Bobo" contest, involving descriptions of contestants and humorous, sexually suggestive banter amongst the hosts and staff member Paul, who returned to the show.  The prize was clarified as $1000 and lunch, not sex with Bobo.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the O.P. and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite.  Oh, fuck yeah!  This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on that, right?  Yeah, a lot.  Yeah, it's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and, of course, your phone calls as well.  Yes, interesting interviews and, of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  This show is so disorganized. 
[00:04:00]  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying this.  Well, then, turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career, the Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, the guy that's off today.  Yeah, Jimmy's off.  Well, he's working, but I guess in another venture. 
[00:04:30]  He's doing some Tonight Show thing, I think?  He's doing some Jay Leno stuff for Fashion Week.  Some Lino.  He's hanging out with the models.  Yes, wow.  He has an early call time, as they say in the business.  Oh.  So he's filming for Jay Leno.  Did he have to go anywhere?  No.  Yeah, because it's like in New York, right?  Yeah, he's a couple blocks away from me.  That's fantastic.  That's good for him.  I would love that gig.  Oh, good for him. 
[00:05:00]  I'm going to go to my other gig now for a little while.  He's all snoozy right now with drool coming out of his mouth.  All curled up on his pillow.  So, you know, I guess we should start by saying the news is doing exactly what we said they  would do.  Fuck, and a couple of respects.  But no surprises here.  You know, obviously we're not seers.  I guess we point out the obvious to people so they can look at it and puke like we do.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so calculated, but basically they're showing ground zero, and it's very dark down 
[00:05:30]  there, and the plink, plink, plink, plink of the piano like we were talking about.  Somber is the word.  Somber.  And now the TV hosts, I'm talking like they are, they're starting to lower their voices  as we get closer to the 10th anniversary of 9-11.  Yes.  And they're not going in full dark yet, Anthony, but their clothes are getting darker as the  days go by.  They are getting darker by Sunday.  They're in very dark gray today.  Yesterday it was a very dark blue. 
[00:06:00]  Today it's a very dark gray, and by Sunday it will look like a fucking funeral.  Funeral.  We're here at ground zero.  As you see, the Freedom Tower is lit up in red, white, and blue.  As you see, the Freedom Tower, which should have been built many, many years ago, still has  cranes and scaffolding all over the place.  Yes.  But they cleaned it up to make it look like it's just about done.  The commemoration this Sunday of the people, men, women, that gave their lives on that 
[00:06:30]  day 10 years ago.  You know, it was 10 years ago today.  On a day just like today.  Yes, yes.  Matter of fact, it's very similar with the blue skies.  Everyone remembers that beautiful, beautiful day with the blue skies.  And at 8.46, there'll be a moment of silence.  I actually remember 7.42.  I took a great dump and thought the day was going to be fantastic. 
[00:07:00]  But little did I know that our worlds would change forever.  Forever and ever and ever and ever.  Forever.  Forever.  So we got that going on.  All the TV stations are in full 10-year anniversary mode.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Our own E-Rock wanted me and Ant to go into 9-11 mode.  Yeah, what the fuck?  And I've been fighting it at every turn.  He writes me yesterday.  He's like, so we're doing the Sean Hannity thing?  And I'm like, what's the Sean Hannity thing? 
[00:07:30]  What's that?  He wants Sean Hannity on ISDN so he can talk about what happened 10 years ago.  I'm not beating you up, by the way, E-Rock.  I really am not.  I'll come later.  I'm really not.  It's more the principle of the whole thing that we just don't want to go there.  And I think it's the right move, to be honest with you.  It's absolutely the way we feel here.  You know, why should we also pile on the fucking pile of people that are doing this shit? 
[00:08:00]  I'll tell you one thing.  I don't own any dark clothes.  Yeah, that's true, too.  I would be in trouble here.  I'd look very in my 5-11 gear.  I don't know.  It's not appropriate.  Yeah, so E-Rock had a good idea, but we just don't want to go with it.  We don't want to have the Sean Hannity on talking about what happened 10 years ago.  So I've never heard our 9-11 show.  I don't want to.  I'm not going to listen to it anytime soon.  I know that.  It was one of those days.  Let it just be there.  Let it be there. 
[00:08:30]  Exactly.  Yeah, it's there.  So what?  We're going to replay the show at least?  This Sunday at 12 o'clock to 6 p.m.  Why not at 846?  Right.  Why not?  I guess they're replaying something else at that time.  What is it?  I think Ron and Fez are on.  Ron and Fez are on at that time.  Oh, Ron and Fez are on.  Because they are doing everything properly, right?  Those fucking brown nosers.  What are they doing?  It's us and Ron and Fez together.  What?  Together again?  On Sunday at 12 will be the September 11, 2001 show of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Then the Ron and Fez show.  And then Ron and Fez did a round table with their original staff from N.E.W.  Oh.  Wow.  They're doing it properly.  They actually are.  Opie, let me explain something.  Yeah.  It's just very, very difficult to sit here and do it.  Too somber.  It's like, I can't hear you.  But it's ten years, ten years ago, as we sat here on September 11, not knowing that the 
[00:09:30]  world would change forever.  E-Rock, are you bummed we're not all in like Ron and Fez?  I know.  E-Rock is all in.  As a radio guy, you're kind of bummed, aren't you?  E-Rock is ready to start producing.  You can be honest.  That actually saves me a ton of work.  Oh, okay.  We call that an E-Rock of work.  Because what do you want?  In and outs and stuff for our ten year anniversary show?  It was just, I was thinking maybe you guys just do a little set up for, before that show  starts.  A little for what?  I don't know what the set up would be. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  What would the set up be?  We'd have to sound, we can't be like, hey, it's Opie and Anthony, like when we usually  do those things.  How you doing?  Make sure you tune in this Sunday for our 9-11 extravaganza.  Yes, death, destruction, and the unknown.  Opie?  I don't know what, yeah, it's got, we'd have to be like, ladies and gentlemen, to make sure  you tune in.  I was thinking more of your XM apology voice.  Oh, really?  Oh, that one?  No, there was disgust in that.  Yeah, there was so much disgust.  You know, this is not going to be a popular statement, but I'd rather forget. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I'd rather remember the stuff I need to, but I want to forget all that other shit.  I'd rather forget and not go back into my memory bank for all that hard shit.  Here's what people are doing, they're remembering the shit that's bad to remember, but they're  forgetting the shit that you're supposed to remember.  Like it was Muslim extremists that did it, that's got to be remembered.  Ever vigilant, still the vigilance, because it says 9-11 terror threat in NYC.  I see, and DC, I guess somebody is up to shenanigans, we'll get into that a little 
[00:11:00]  later, I guess, and we should remember that stuff, and remember, you know, all the people  that died, but you know what?  I don't want to remember and talk about my thoughts and experiences, and you know, if  it comes up in a show, we talk about it.  Sure.  I don't want to dedicate a day to it.  No, I would rather not remember the smell of dead bodies and plastic that was in Manhattan  for days after 9-11. 
[00:11:30]  I know.  Can we get crying people?  That'd be good, a montage of the crying people.  Are there crying people during the 9-11 show?  Oh, man.  Letterman?  The 9-11 show?  John Stewart?  No.  Crying?  Um, yeah.  Trying to find all the crying people.  Yeah, none of the calls were crying during your show.  Oh, fuck.  What's wrong with those people?  You're speaking to cops.  You're speaking to Louis Black, Jay Moore, Norton called in.  Right.  Steve C. was coming back from the stomach doctor.  Yes.  Oh.  Another disaster. 
[00:12:00]  9-11.  At one point, you go, oh, wait, wait, we're supposed to be upset today.  Yes.  Another collapse.  I don't know.  Tune into the show if you want this Sunday.  Let Ron Ephes be the brown noses with that fucking roundtable discussion.  Who did they bring back 10 years later?  Al Dukes?  No, because Al and they had a guy, Rory, on their staff.  They couldn't make it into the city that day.  But they had Earl.  Earl.  Oh, well, that's going to be fascinating commentary. 
[00:12:30]  It must have been tough to get Earl to come back 10 years later.  What is he doing?  His career has taken off to the point where I'm surprised they were able to fly Earl in  for the big roundtable discussion from 9-11.  How did they get away from his BlackRock coalition duties?  Because that's probably in full swing now 10 years later.  Oh, it has to be.  I had lost touch with Earl a long time ago, but he's got to be a massive record executive  out there in L.A., right?  Yeah.  What is he doing?  Earl, I could hear him.  Oh, I remember. 
[00:13:00]  And just a snooze fest of a story.  It's going to be a snooze fest of a story that Earl tells.  And in all fairness, Ronnie will make something out of it.  Oh, Ronnie is a genius, and he will make something of it.  But fuck.  But Earl?  Oh, God.  And Billy Staples.  Oh, great.  Another fucking mental patient.  They told a story that he hid in a bathroom on the Long Island Railroad just to get into  the city.  Like, that they were bringing the trains back in, so he hid in one of the bathrooms.  How did he hide in a bathroom? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, no kidding.  Jesus Christ.  That must have been one of those handicapped bathrooms.  That fat lump of shit.  We could wheel in the invalid.  So they could shit one of those bathrooms.  All right.  So we got Earl.  And Billy Staples.  And Billy Staples.  And why did he hide in the bathroom?  He needed to be in the city for Ron and Freddie.  Yeah, yeah.  Because Ronnie couldn't handle it by himself.  He needed Billy Staples in that day.  Billy needed the attention, is what Billy needed.  Yeah.  Yeah, Billy wanted to be part of something.  As we know, Billy.  Who else?  And their original Hawk producer. 
[00:14:00]  Wait, aren't you Hawk?  I guess.  I got that name afterwards.  Oh.  But they had a producer named Hawk as well.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  So those three in there.  And I think maybe Al Dukes called in.  To tell about being stuck at home and watching television like everyone else.  Good old Al Dukes.  Again, I'm sure Ronnie will make magic of it.  That guy can do anything.  Any of these guys have careers?  Yeah.  Ten years later?  I'm more curious to know what the fuck they've done with their lives in ten years. 
[00:14:30]  I know Al Dukes.  Than their dumb memories.  You want to talk about a disaster?  Earl Douglas' career over the past ten years.  Achieving nothingness on a grand scale.  What is Earl doing?  I don't know.  Let's be fair.  I'm not really sure.  I'll tell you what Earl was doing ten years ago, and then you tell me what he's doing now.  Hanging photos.  He was hanging photos.  He was...  He was...  That's right.  Wow.  What did he do?  Seriously, what did he do?  The public file.  He sort of was on our show so we could beat the shit out of him. 
[00:15:00]  Was he your fire marshal for the floor?  He was the fire marshal.  I think he was the assistant.  Assistant.  Assistant to the assistant manager.  We gave him a gig because we felt bad, so we got him the assistant fire marshal position,  I believe.  I'm going to be assistant traffic director.  And then I pushed him on Ron Efez, which was...  That was good.  Not one of my better ideas.  That was a good trade.  I still can't look Ronnie in the eye.  We got absolutely nothing.  They got Earl.  Fair trade.  Yeah.  What was Earl doing for any W back then?  Public file.  Sticker stops.  Sticker stops.  So he worked on the public file. 
[00:15:30]  He handed out stickers, and we made him the assistant fire marshal.  What is he doing now, 10 years later?  Go ahead, E.  Oh, no.  The nude pictures.  Let's talk again.  The nude photo shoot.  The nude photo shoot of Earl.  This was...  Oh, God.  Is that disgusting?  Why does he have a white man's body?  He has the skin of a white man.  And the face of a black man. 
[00:16:00]  And the face of a black man.  It's like some kind of a weird...  Is that photoshopped?  Transplant sci-fi.  Why is his skin so much lighter?  He's doing the pose that, if you remember, Jennifer Aniston did the same pose on the cover of Rolling Stone.  Trust me, it was a lot hotter when Aniston did it.  Oh, yeah.  And what you got there is Earl looking pensive, I think.  What?  Where his ass is just out of touch.  That is...  Yeah, there's the shot.  There's the Aniston shot. 
[00:16:30]  God damn it, that ass cracked.  Thank God Earl's shoulder is blocking his ass, though.  Like...  I think that photo was taken at Earl's studio.  Like, they set it up in the back part of the studio.  Hey, you don't know that he is the vibe manager at the Hard Rock?  That's what I was trying to get.  What the fuck is that?  The vibe manager?  Our listeners know what Earl's doing.  We don't even know.  Hey, I'm assistant to the assistant vibe manager.  From what Ron says, he goes to the Hard Rock and feels out what the vibe of the room is for whatever event? 
[00:17:00]  It's fucking...  There's people in there, and they're having fucking Ronnie James Dio burgers.  What are you talking about?  I'm not doing this justice, but I think Ron says...  He feels out the vibe?  He feels out the vibe so they know how to decorate to set the mood.  Look, that's a non-job.  See, Hard Rock Johnny, like many that have come before him, feels sorry for Earl.  So they give him these nonsense jobs.  Yeah, it is a nonsense job.  What are you talking about?  That's all I...  I've heard bits and pieces. 
[00:17:30]  Okay, so a lot of the people that go into the Hard Rock Cafe are tourists from the Midwest.  Yeah.  So what kind of vibe could that be?  Yeah, it's great.  They sit there, they fucking order food.  It's the same vibe every day is what I'm getting at because of where the place is located.  Could you manage the vibe for us here, Earl, please?  The vibe needs some managing.  Okay.  Okay.  You got it.  I think the vibe is a bit pensive today.  Yeah.  We really got to get the vibe up in here. 
[00:18:00]  I think a little Stevie Wonder should help.  Is that what he does?  And does he play records at least?  I have no idea.  Just past that title, I have no idea what the job entails.  Is Hard Rock Johnny up yet?  He's got a call.  I need to know what Earl does as the vibe manager.  I need to know because what that it would be in the literal sense would be to walk into  a place and look around.  Yeah.  There's nothing then that you could like, does he then help the vibe in some way or does 
[00:18:30]  he just tell someone what the vibe is and then they then go and, you know, delegate the  responsibility of maybe changing the vibe through decoration, music, lighting, whatever.  Like, what does the vibe manager do?  Yeah, that's what Earl's doing is hanging guitars and Elvis jumpsuits and it's taking  him days.  Days.  That could take weeks.  It's not easy to make a guitar look, you know, balanced on a wall.  I have never.  Is Earl up?  Can we try to call him?  Oh, stop. 
[00:19:00]  Why would he?  Just stop.  Why would he be up?  Right, Ant?  Of course.  Yeah.  Well, I have never, never known a man that has done less in his life yet has, has had  people like hire him for, for nothing jobs than Earl Douglas.  He, what did he do for Scott Muni?  Scott used to come in and do his own show.  We got a hotline call coming in.  Hotline.  Just waiting.  Who is this Earl?  Hardrock.  Oh, nice.  Hey. 
[00:19:30]  Hardrock.  Hardrock.  It's been a while, sir.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you, Blake?  Very good, sir.  We're trying to figure out what Earl does for you.  Earl, basically, so we have these guys that have a bunch of different Hardrocks around  and they, uh, sorry, sparking my car.  He's like our program director, so he kind of programs the music.  It was, you know, he kind of, he kind of filled the vibe.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're the Hardrock Cafe.  You don't need anyone programming your music. 
[00:20:00]  You play Nirvana, Hendrix, a little Zeppelin, a little Joplin, you're good.  I've been to the Hardrock.  There's video screens up.  It's very cool.  You sit there.  You fucking, you know, you eat your food.  You have your fucking REO Speedwagon fries.  Yeah, whatever it is.  And then, like, you look at the videos and you see, ah, look, it's AHA, take on me.  Right.  And, and, and all the rubes and tourists are eating their, their food.  What is Earl got a program?  He just, it feels out the room a little bit.  I think kind of looks around. 
[00:20:30]  I'm loving this.  What there is for, you know, maybe make it a little bit better for people.  Wow, Johnny, you, you want to help everyone.  You are a fucking, a saint.  Yeah.  You are a saint.  A saint on earth.  A saint on earth.  He does a great job for us and we're very happy to have him.  But it doesn't change because you've got the same people coming in every day.  He does a great job and we're happy to have him.  You know, you know what Earl does?  Remember the movie Bill?  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  He, Wild Bill's Coffee Shop.  Yeah.  And they, they, it was a coffee shop.  It was a fucking place.  They had a cafeteria thing.  Sure.  And Wild Bill made the coffee.  Bill did more in that movie as a retarded gentleman.  Than Earl does as the vibe manager.  Is there an assistant vibe manager for Earl?  No, no.  He is the vibe manager.  Does he have an office?  No.  Does he play records? 
[00:21:30]  He actually has control of the video system at times.  At times.  So he looks around.  Let me, let me, let me get this straight.  So now a bus pulls up to the Hard Rock, New York, which is in a beautiful Times Square.  And a bus pulls up.  And let's say people get off and they're in their maybe 50s, right?  Yep.  And they come in.  Earl looks and goes, look, we can't be playing fucking, you know, some shit.  They're straight.  Right, right, right.  Oh, maybe.  No, no, actually you could. 
[00:22:00]  We can't be playing any new shit.  Right, okay.  You know, we don't want to be playing any new music.  Right.  Earl feels the vibe out and goes, we got to be playing some classic rock on these screens.  Exactly.  All right.  And then who actually presses the button?  Would he throw in a little 80s new wave for those people?  Ah, true.  That is his prerogative.  We're hoping that he does.  Okay, now let's see.  What would he program for a flash mob running into the hard rock to steal memorabilia? 
[00:22:30]  Do you guys have enough hip hop for that?  We might have a few things.  Hopefully we don't have to get there, but yeah.  Oh, hopefully, of course.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus Christ on a cross.  Now we got to talk to Earl.  I have to talk to Earl about his job.  Well, Johnny, you're just a saint.  You are.  You are giving, my friend.  You are the one that's giving.  You really are.  He does a great job and we're happy to have him.  I love that line.  What's your memory of 10 years ago? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yes.  Hard rock, Johnny.  As we get closer and closer to the 10-year anniversary of 9-11.  Hard rock, Johnny, were you in the 57th Street location at the time?  Yes, I was.  I was there.  Yes, you were.  And were you there that morning?  I certainly was.  You were on 57th, between 7th and Broadway.  Mere miles from the actual event.  What are your recollections, sir? 
[00:23:30]  A lot of traffic.  Yes, a lot of traffic.  There was a lot of traffic.  Oh, it was a bitch.  Yeah, hard to get home.  That's, yes, yes.  The vibe was.  Yes, the vibe.  Well, we got to talk to Earl about the vibe.  Yeah.  He was able to change the music that day to make it a little bit better.  What's his title?  Mine or his?  Earl's title.  Yeah, we know you're the guy over there.  He's the vibe manager.  And that sounds like a completely made up.  Could you put vibe manager in Google and see if anyone else is a vibe manager and what 
[00:24:00]  it means?  And how many hours?  It says meet the vibe manager in Hard Rock San Diego.  Now he's there.  Look at this guy.  Now he looks like he's a hip dude.  He's a young, hip guy.  He's giving the rock fucking horns with his fingers.  There's your vibe manager from where?  Hard Rock San Diego.  Yeah, look at him.  Wow, okay.  He's wearing his chucks.  He's dressing the part. 
[00:24:30]  How many hours a week does Earl work?  He's 25 years old.  Earl's, what, 40 at this point?  He's got to be 50, something like that.  Yeah.  How many hours does Earl work for you, John?  Oh, good question.  Probably 30 to 40 hours.  You know, it depends on how busy it is.  I mean, when we're busy, he's going to work a full 40-hour week.  40-hour week?  That's crazy for Earl.  Is he all right with that?  He's great.  How much vibe is changing?  I could see the vibe changing by the busload of people.  I've seen it.  Busloads pull up.  But in general.  The Hard Rock does very well. 
[00:25:00]  It's a fucking, by the way, the Manhattan Hard Rock is a great Hard Rock.  Yes.  And because it's so big, you don't feel cramped in there.  They got a giant store in the front for buying stuff.  But the vibe doesn't change on a minute-to-minute basis.  He could walk in there, look around and go, all right, play this today.  And then he's back in bed.  Oh, can I have the job, Hard Rock Johnny?  Because I would walk in as the vibe manager and go, oh, vibe looks good today.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Right. 
[00:25:30]  Send my check.  Right.  Send my check.  Do a quick spin around the place.  You know what?  The vibe is right where it should be, Johnny.  Vibe's looking good.  See you tomorrow.  If things ever change, you need some help.  We might be able to help you out.  But right now, Earl does a really good job.  Look, Johnny, let's be honest with each other.  You know it's a bullshit job.  It's a bullshit job.  He does a good job for us, and we're happy to have him.  Is this a write-off?  Oh, oh.  The tax write-off.  Is this a charity write-off for Hard Rock Johnny? 
[00:26:00]  Is this a money laundering scheme?  Are you laundering illicit funds through Earl Douglas and his Black Rock Coalition?  No, Earl does a wonderful job.  I mean, you guys know he's got a great music knowledge.  He does know more about music than anyone I've ever met.  Yeah.  Well, he focuses on the Black Rock a little too much.  He does.  That's always been his problem.  He spreads it out a little bit over all genres of music.  He's got a great knowledge, and it's good for us. 
[00:26:30]  Well, here's Hard Rock Johnny after Earl checks out the vibe and is pretty much done for the day.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  End person.  Johnny, is it true you're doing something with your stomach, too?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it works just around, huh?  Oh, boy.  You must have been on Ron and Fez talking about it.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Wait, getting the stapling there? 
[00:27:00]  Something like that.  It's called a sleeve.  They're going to cut 85% of my stomach out.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's quite a bit of stomach, I'm sure, but more than the average.  But, you know.  I would never allow that.  Why would you do that?  That's a lot of stomach to cut out.  That scares the shit out of me.  And what's the prognosis for something like that?  What's the weight loss and the timing on that?  100 to 150 pounds in a year.  Holy shit.  Wow.  How much do you weigh, if you don't mind me asking? 
[00:27:30]  Let's say it's not in the threes.  Let's say I'm almost around the 400.  Wow.  You're almost 400 pounds?  Holy Jesus.  Yeah.  You carry your weight well, sir.  Yeah, I'm still a fat bastard, though.  So it means to get done.  Holy shit.  I would have never guessed that.  All right.  I'm surprised on the boardwalks.  You know, I can't guess the weight too well, but it's a bit of a need to get done.  Yeah.  Well, good luck with that. 
[00:28:00]  And, of course, good luck.  And the stomach operation.  Yeah.  Have her all hang something for you one day.  You'll love it.  You'll love the experience.  It's an amazing thing.  The vibe manager is in charge of hanging the photos.  I know we have some problems.  The vibe manager.  The vibe manager.  That's fantastic.  All right.  At least he's someone else's responsibility.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Hard Rock.  We're happy to have him.  All right.  We'll be by soon for a burger or something. 
[00:28:30]  All right.  All right.  There goes Johnny from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  So there you go.  Sunday is a big day for this channel.  Sunday at noon.  At noon it all starts.  Okay.  Good enough.  Yeah.  Oh, the other thing I wanted to point out, we were just talking about this two days ago.  We were talking about what was going on on our show on September 10th, 2001.  On September 10th.  And we goofed about it.  We joked about it.  And we got, unfortunately, we can't find the actual show, which sucks. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  But we got a little taste through the internet and stuff like that.  And then we turned on MSNBC and they did a whole, what was happening on 9, 10, 2001 on  NBC.  Yeah.  And they ran a bunch of clips of what was happening.  And apparently they were talking about the economy and sharks.  Remember there were a lot of shark attacks.  Another shark attack in Florida.  Yeah.  And they were just going one after the other with clips of 10 years ago.  And we're not as bad as who, who, but I'll tell you this much. 
[00:29:30]  It makes us a little suspicious.  Yeah.  On that day, September 10th.  Yeah.  And they were really, there was nothing really going on.  There's nothing going on.  Like Al Roker's talking about the weather and it's like, well, it's going to be a great  day and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Right.  And then they ended with a...  It was Fat Al Roker, by the way.  Fat Al Roker, yes.  10 years ago, Al was a big fat fuck.  Yeah.  Now he's just a fuck.  Now he's just a fuck. 
[00:30:00]  Who gets very upset on Twitter.  It's very easy to get to Al Roker.  So anyway.  Yeah.  That was so that, yeah, they did that.  And, and they ended actually the whole thing with saying how George Bush, President Bush  was going to be going to a school and, you know, reading about education and stuff the  next day.  And we all know how that ended.  Wow.  His eyes darting around like, holy shit, holy shit.  What the fuck?  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  This worked out perfectly for me. 
[00:30:30]  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  So.  All right.  Obama's speech there, Ant.  Yes.  Obama's speech.  A lot of people talking about the Obama speech thing.  Yeah.  Fiery, I think.  He was pretty, he was pretty fiery.  They're calling it a little combative, right?  Combative.  I used a different word in the privacy of my own home.  But, but yeah, I was watching, I was watching the speech.  We should read your mind at this point. 
[00:31:00]  It doesn't take much.  No, not at all.  There's not, there's not much to read.  There's not much mind.  Yeah.  I, I, I, I called it a lot of the news organizations, even MSNBC.  If you don't watch that channel, it is a, it's a communist news channel.  It took over, it took over where, um, the Russian, uh, public, uh, media left off when  the Soviet Union fell.  Isn't it the opposite of Fox though, to be fair? 
[00:31:30]  No.  You don't think so?  It's worse to the left than Fox is to the right.  And, and you could say that that's not true.  But, um, when you got the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton now as a full-time employee on MSNBC,  uh, and, and actually trying to get some kind of credibility, whoever hired him is a fucking  idiot.  Yeah.  I don't know why they would do that.  Cause I, I do watch MSNBC with, with the rest of them.  I, I, I told Ant before the show, I, I, I, I roll it out, man.  Fox, CNN, MSNBC.  I go around the dial there. 
[00:32:00]  And, uh, now that Reverend Al is on, fuck that.  Yeah.  I will not be watching.  No, no.  It's, there's no reason to.  I don't know what it is.  He just puts a bad fucking taste in your mouth.  He, uh, he does this round table thing with everybody else after these speeches, right?  Cause now he's, he's an employee, right?  And everybody else is hash and shit.  You know, they got their left leaning views and whatever, and that's fine.  Uh, and that is the equivalent of, of what Fox does on the other end of the spectrum. 
[00:32:30]  But then to see Reverend Al thrown in there, this fucking jackass who has zero credibility  should not be on any news station unless they're discussing his, his fucking lying background.  Uh, uh, then I, I can't see it.  And he's not trained for this.  And I don't think he's as knowledgeable, whether you agree or disagree with the people  on MSNBC, they're at least knowledgeable about what they're talking about.  Yeah.  And then you get Reverend Al and you're like, wow, he's way in, way in over his head.  Oh yeah.  And I would love to know if there was some kind of a race fucking threat that was made 
[00:33:00]  that got him that job there at MSNBC, because, um, well, we, we all know how our Al can, can,  uh, go behind the scenes and, and kind of get his way.  Does he still have a show on XM?  I'm not sure.  The only reason he got a show on XM was because he was threatening to make a big deal about  me and Ant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a fact, by the way, this is a fact.  And then the executives calmed Al, Al down and said, look, how about, how about we put  your little show on XM? 
[00:33:30]  Give you a bigger audience.  And then everyone got nice and calm.  So, uh, Reverend Al held up XM at the time when we were in that homeless Charlie hell.  Yeah.  So we know that shit does go on.  He's terrible and, uh, should not be given any credibility.  He's a fucking scourge, a pariah on society.  That's what I call Reverend, Reverend Al.  But what about Obama?  Yeah.  Obama, uh, gave his speech.  You know what?  And it was exactly what I said.  And the other news organizations are picking up on it. 
[00:34:00]  Um, like I said, even MSNBC, who is pro Obama.  Uh, it, it was a campaign speech.  It was a campaign speech full of, um, uh, uh, I don't know, ideas, promises, but with no  real way to do it and no way to pay the, what I believe is $450 billion that, uh, price  tag on this thing, um, it's a bill that he said has to be signed right now.  This should be signed right now, this jobs bill.  And it's like, really?  By the time, uh, they get it to sign it, uh, it's just going to be bogged down with more 
[00:34:30]  shit.  And from both sides, believe me, they're going to add stuff to it.  And it's like, I'm not signing that because there's all of a sudden some fucking thing  where that says, uh, uh, we're going to plant nuclear waste in fucking, uh, uh, Oregon.  I'll be like, why is that on the jobs bill?  I, I, well, we threw it in there.  Well, fuck you.  I don't understand that.  I, I don't, I don't understand how they had all that shit that has nothing to do with 
[00:35:00]  the main, the main bill, main part of the bill, I should say.  Fucking pork, pork barrel, uh, uh, uh, it's just, do you know the history of that?  I don't know how that happened.  I don't know how.  Way back in the day, they would have a bill.  It's like, okay, uh, more jobs for America.  Let's say it's fucking 1820.  Uh-huh.  And then someone got the bright idea.  Well, we could sneak some other shit into this bill.  Yeah.  It's like, all right, let me sign that.  And then they slip in the bill.  And instead of signing it, he writes some more shit under it and then signs it.  Right. 
[00:35:30]  It's like, wait a minute.  You slipped something in there, didn't you?  So then another guy grabs it and go, well, if you're going to do that, I'm going to do  this.  And I'm putting this on there.  Here you, here you.  I bet that's how it happened.  It doesn't make sense to me.  No.  And that's why nothing gets done, by the way, because a lot of people can agree on  one thing.  That's easy to do.  Even that's tough to do.  Yeah.  But if you think about it, it's very tough.  But it is possible.  It's easier than trying to agree on fucking 500 things I shoved in your face, most of  which they don't even understand or read. 
[00:36:00]  It's just fucking ridiculous.  Hate it.  So he got up there, he talked about the job, talked again about how we'll use the rebuilding  of the infrastructure of this country, highways, bridges, and whatnot, to create jobs.  And it's like that, you know, I guess it worked in the 30s and shit like that.  They were able to start building some highways and stuff.  But I think there's a lot of people out there that are out at work that really don't know  how to make highways and bridges. 
[00:36:30]  Uh-oh.  You know?  Well, you thought the guys in the 30s did, though?  No, you know what, though?  Easily trainable.  And there wasn't really a lot of high-tech computer jobs back then.  You know, there were a lot of working Joes out of work back in the oldie days.  We called them the Lunch Pail Guys.  The Lunch Pail Guys.  Like the Lunch Pail Guys.  Everyone knew how to fix their car.  They had a set of tools.  And when they came up with this, let's build the infrastructure of the United States and  build dams and huge bridges and stuff, they were able to get a fuckload of people 
[00:37:00]  from various backgrounds to get on board and build these things.  Now we've got a lot of high-tech jobs.  So what, we just got lazy as a country?  Well, yeah.  Or there was a shift in technology?  I think there was a shift in jobs.  There was a lot more blue-collar jobs.  Well, because we had strictly blue-collar and white-collar jobs back then.  Because we were still building the damn thing.  Yeah, we're still building the country.  Yeah.  Once you've got fucking hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place, where's there to go?  You're just there to take the money now.  Just sit back, get fat, and collect the money. 
[00:37:30]  Past go.  You know, once you've got hotels on all your property, ah, what are you going to do?  One guy understands pork barreling on the line.  And I also want to ask, because we all know you're not a fan of Obama.  No.  I'm not really a fan either.  No.  I just don't have the passion that you do.  You should go for the Just for Men, too.  He did a little bit.  Did he?  Yeah, he's been grayer than that.  Has he?  Really?  Oh, yeah, he has.  Because he's looking like tinsel.  I thought last night he might have put a little medicine in.  Just a little.  Because he doesn't want it to be completely obvious.  He doesn't want it to be completely, yeah, gray. 
[00:38:00]  That man will be completely gray by the end of his term.  He's going to look like what used to be called an old pappy.  Where he's got complete white hair and no teeth.  And that little tuft out of cotton on his chin.  And he's going, I remember my first time as president of these unions.  United States of America.  The old pappy.  If I was black, I would never let my hair go gray.  It looks.  Sorry to the black guys out there, but you have a few in your family. 
[00:38:30]  It looks ridiculous when an old guy has just shocking gray hair.  But they got the thing that they don't get like the wrinkles that white people get.  That's why you can keep the fucking Just for Men in your hair way past a white guy.  Yeah, exactly.  So they get that, but when they go gray, yeah, yeah, they got to fix that shit.  It kind of looks a little silly, right?  It does look silly as hell.  It's so stark.  The contrast between the dark skin and the shocking white hair.  It looks very odd. 
[00:39:00]  Let's learn about pork barreling.  Oklahoma.  What's up, buddy?  Oklahoma.  I don't know the rest.  What?  I said, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  What's your name, brother?  Yeah, Bill.  All right, Bill.  Give us the pork barreling very quickly.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  All right.  You know, when Obama first came into office, one of his platforms was ending pork barrel  spinning when they were adding, when all these senators were adding all this shit to Bill's.  Yeah.  And nothing has ever been done about it. 
[00:39:30]  I find it funny that he's just now addressing it at the end of his damn term.  Yeah.  It's not the end of his term.  He still has well over a year.  I know, but I mean, we're...  It's like quarters of the way through his term, and he's just now addressing it.  Now addressing the fact that he doesn't want this bill, his jobs bill, bogged down with  earmarks and pork barrel crap.  But Bill's not explaining what the whole pork barreling is about and where it came from.  Like, I don't understand why you're just allowed to add something to a bill. 
[00:40:00]  I didn't learn that in fucking school.  See, the big problem of it is a lot of senators, billmakers, all in bed with businesses.  We know that.  That's a big problem.  And it's an I scratch your back, you scratch my back fucking thing.  And that's how big government businesses get their contracts.  And it's like, hey, you add this to a bill, and we'll allow you to keep doing business.  And that's where a lot of our fucking tech comes from. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  Yeah, I just don't fucking know, like, historically, who came up with it, who thought it was a good  idea.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, I'm sure at the time it was a good idea.  Or seemed like a good idea.  I don't know.  Everything always starts out like it seems like a good idea.  To me, it just never sounded like a good idea.  Yeah.  It seems sneaky, and it would always seem sneaky to me.  Like, if it's so, why not discuss it with everybody?  Don't just slip this bullshit in into a 5,000-page bill that needs to be signed the next day 
[00:41:00]  and think people are going to read this thing.  A lot of shit gets slipped through.  Like that.  And it's horse shit, I say.  It's impossible to read all that stuff, which scares the shit out of me, too.  So these guys are just...  How do they know exactly what's in these things sometimes?  They don't.  And a lot of times, dude, fucking interns are reading this shit.  And pages.  Pages are reading the pages.  And actually reporting back to the politician and giving him the edited-down version. 
[00:41:30]  The bullet points.  So you got, you know, the likes of a fucking intern David.  Type of guy.  Sitting there was.  Well, there was a time when the interns ran our program.  So we could honestly understand that.  I heard one intern, actually a senator, kicked him in the ball.  And no, this is a story from Washington.  Oh, okay.  Straight out of D.C.  Oh, you scared me for a second. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, what happened?  Well, that senator had to actually take some time off.  Really?  Yep.  Unpaid.  Unpaid?  Yep.  That's crazy.  He was kicking his own intern in the balls.  Why would he kick an intern in the balls if he had such a great position down there in D.C.?  If you ask me, it was totally accidental.  I think the chairs were too close.  I don't know what happened.  No, it's not that senator.  People sure do pick up on a story. 
[00:42:30]  They put pieces together like a puzzle on this show.  Oh, really?  Because that wasn't obvious?  I know.  Please.  Hi, senator.  Hello, senator.  It's amazing.  We got politicians in here today.  A senator just waved to me through a window.  That's a weird timing thing.  It's great.  Jobs Obama creates will be taken by the illegals.  Illegals.  Jobs will go to the unions, not the regular people.  Well, this is true. 
[00:43:00]  The unions, by the way, completely back Obama.  It's amazing.  They love the Obama.  Just love them.  And there's some shenanigans going on there, I think.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know.  They do like them.  They like them.  They really do like them.  Yeah.  Enticing senators.  That's where the pork barreling.  They entasked me to pork barrel.  All right.  We're going to try this one more time, man.  Maybe we'll get an answer from Steve in Texas.  Steve.  Yes. 
[00:43:30]  How's it going this morning?  I'm a pork barrel.  Do you got fires down there or something?  I was reading somewhere.  As a matter of fact, I'm going probably right past a bunch of them.  Yeah, we've been having a bunch of fires.  It hasn't rained in forever down here.  So I get some Yahoo from Oklahoma and chunk out a cigarette and all of a sudden, you know,  half the damn state's on fire.  They're saying it was a cigarette?  How do they know that?  You know, I have no idea.  You know, I think it's stupid because I toss shit out the window all the time trying to 
[00:44:00]  start them and I never see nothing.  I swear to God, I feel like setting a fire and burning down a business has to be the easiest  thing you could do, but they catch the guy every fucking time.  How?  It's amazing.  Well, it's Texas, so there's always somebody watching you, you know?  I mean, there's a bunch of old folks that ain't got nothing else better to do and they  just say that guy did it.  But I love, they go through the remains of a house or something.  There's absolutely nothing left. 
[00:44:30]  It's leveled and everything is just soot.  And they're like, oh, there it is.  A candle was lit on the second floor.  Second floor?  There's no second floor to look at.  How do you know that?  Yeah, it's totally gone.  Right.  Oh, this obviously started in the attic.  Well, the attic is now on the ground, so how is that obvious?  I think they just make that shit up.  I think it's one of those where, you know, it justifies someone getting paid what they  do.  You know how that is.  Anyway, about the point, bro.  What does that mean?  I know. 
[00:45:00]  Steve, I love you, brother.  All right, so go ahead.  What do you got on pork barrels?  Basically, where the term comes from, and of course, I learned it in college, so it's  probably complete bullshit.  But basically what it is, is back before refrigeration, when they used to ship pork and stuff, they  used to just get a barrel, cut up the pork or, you know, the pig.  It's just a mishmash of different parts.  Stop it.  We got any pork back there?  Okay, Ronnie.  Fresh out. 
[00:45:30]  It's just, it's one of those things where, I mean, you may have like three heads in one  barrel and, you know, 15 hooves in the other.  That's where it comes from.  It's just a mishmash of different, you know, pieces of meat.  And that's, you know, as far as the bills, you know, it's just a mishmash of a bunch  of different shit thrown together.  So some asshole in, you know, Iowa gets a walk and park when the bill is all about foreign  trade.  See, now I'm reading something different here.  There's a claim that the phrase originated in a pre-Civil War practice of giving slaves 
[00:46:00]  a barrel of salt pork as a reward and requiring them to compete amongst themselves to get their  share of the handout.  I love how they politely say to compete.  Compete.  Yeah, what are they doing?  What are they actually doing?  You know, fucking the discus throw?  Right.  What are they doing?  Discus?  I think it was a 50-yard dash.  Yeah, yeah.  It was used.  Hurtles.  I love how they try to kind of clean everything up.  There was no competing going on. 
[00:46:30]  Pre-Civil War practice.  That was, they were fighting for their lives.  It was a fight to the death.  It was basically, yeah, they were basically gladiators.  Here's an interesting fact, if you want to talk about the slaves and everything.  It's not interesting.  Well, love this.  Yes, sir.  Back, you know, in that same era, even before that, lobster was actually considered like a  junk fish.  It was just, you know, shit that they catch.  They used to give it to all the slaves to feed them. 
[00:47:00]  And then one day, a white person sat there, put some butter on it, and said, fuck, this  is good.  And then, you know, of course, they can't afford it.  I think I read that once on some website.  I can't remember the name of it.  But I think I read that.  I'm not sure if that's at all true.  You know what, though?  No surprise there.  Because if you look at a lobster, you think to yourself, there's no way this could taste  fucking good.  It's a monster.  How the fuck do we get inside of this damn thing and see what it's got?  It's a tiny little armor-plated monster that is, it's delicious. 
[00:47:30]  Before someone cracked that open, too, I guess you would have to assume if you were living  back then that it had to be filled with bones under the armor.  Yeah.  Or the shell, whatever the hell you want to call it.  Uncooked.  It does not look very appetizing.  Nope.  So when you just crack it open and go, what's in there?  And go, oh, that doesn't look tasty at all.  But once you cook it, it turns a nice red color, and it's so tasty with butter and lemon.  You ever think about how, you know, things became tasty?  Like, there was a time where some asshole had to try everything that they see.  Yeah.  Around them. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  They tried everything.  And some shit tasted good, and some shit tasted horrible.  Right.  So stuff you can't even imagine anyone would ever try, they tried it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just pulling leaves off trees, going, nope.  Nope.  And then eventually somebody, like, put together a bunch of tasty leaves and called it a salad.  You know what, though?  Go on with your tasty leaf thing, because we've got a little chemistry going on right now.  Yeah.  Some guy had to fucking try poison ivy.  Oh, that must not have worked well.  If you're trying leaves, you had to try poison ivy. 
[00:48:30]  Poison ivy salad.  Right.  Oh.  I bet that was just too bitter.  I bet it didn't get too far.  And then your mouth swelled.  Oh, man.  Got itchy.  Your throat closes and you died.  Right.  That's what I'm getting at, man.  I mean, there are people that sacrificed their own lives to figure out what tasted good and  what we should stay away from.  Boy, a lot of people must have died to give us the food we eat today.  Just to know that something's poison, somebody had to eat it and die. 
[00:49:00]  Where's the statue for poison ivy, guy?  Yeah, where's his statue?  Where's the statue for the guy that tried poison ivy and alerted everyone that, nah, this is not a good idea.  Where's the some mushrooms are good, some ain't good guy?  Statue.  There's a few.  There's probably a few.  A guy eats a mushroom and he drops dead and they go, eh, you know what?  We need to commemorate that.  Yeah, I still don't trust mushrooms.  I fried up some portobello the other night with my steak and I still look at those mushrooms like, what the fuck?  How do I know for sure? 
[00:49:30]  Do you always feel like that when you eat a mushroom?  You're like, how do I know?  Anything that looks that weird.  I think mushrooms are absolutely from outer space, by the way.  Mushrooms are fucking great.  Different from outer space.  It's a fungi.  It's a fungus you're eating.  It's disgusting.  I got fungus under my right ball bag.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I think so.  How did you get fungus?  I do a lot of biking and it's a little fucking... 
[00:50:00]  Have you been to the doctor about that?  Oh, no, no.  It's a little jock itch problem.  But I wonder if it would be tasty if I let it go.  Oh, my God.  You don't get an itchy ball bag every once in a while?  Oh, look, they're showing testicle fungus forums.  Oh, really?  You don't get an itchy ball bag every once in a while from all the working out you do?  Well, I shower right after I work out.  No, I don't shower sometimes.  No, I have to.  It's just a sweat fest.  Got too much going on.  It's disgusting.  I'm too nasty. 
[00:50:30]  Nasty.  So I don't know if we learned anything from Obama's thing.  No, I guess he was trying to get some jobs.  He hasn't said how many jobs this will create.  He hasn't said where they're actually coming from.  He talked about some tax cuts for businesses that are hiring people and payroll tax cuts.  But then he talked about taxing the wealthy again, and that category are people that own businesses. 
[00:51:00]  So I sat there going, wait a minute.  He's talking about cutting taxes for companies and then taxing the wealthy.  But his idea of wealthy are people that own businesses.  See, so you're really not giving anyone a tax break.  Look, I'm starting to get the idea that we just can't figure this out.  No, we can't.  And I think when Obama's gone and the next guy comes in, I hope he has a better idea. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know.  Obama had two years with a complete Democratic backing.  Pretty much anything he wanted to put through, he could get through.  And really didn't get anything accomplished except for the health care thing, which no one really wants.  It's in courts right now where people, states are trying to say they don't have to adhere to it.  So that's what I call a boondoggle.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Boondoggle. 
[00:52:00]  But I don't know.  Nothing's getting there.  If we kind of get...  What scares me, though, just to jump in, I'm sorry.  What?  Obama has 14 months left?  To live?  That's terrible.  What has he got?  And the Republicans want him to just kind of hang out there and die, basically?  They want him to be a lame duck president for the rest of his first term.  So the country itself has to wait 14 months before maybe we get things done? 
[00:52:30]  That's what scares the shit out of me, man.  See, when you have a two-party system, you can't have a president and the competition of the president making the president look good.  Because that's just going to get him voted into office.  The Republicans don't want that.  So they're going to fight him at every turn, regardless if it's good for the country or not.  Right.  I don't think it would be anyway.  Because I don't like his ideas.  They're a little too fucking lefty for me.  You know what?  But I like your thought process there.  But that's exactly what it is. 
[00:53:00]  I understand you don't like Obama, but I like looking at the system as a whole.  Right, right.  It scares the shit out of me.  Nothing will get done.  Like last night, Obama's saying his shit, right?  And you've got half the room basically standing and applauding and the other half going, go fuck yourself.  And I'm thinking, this is American.  I hate that.  Can we all either sit there and say, go fuck yourself, or everyone stand up and say, rah, rah, rah?  Yeah, yeah.  And I know that's like fucking some dumb dream that'll never happen, but it scares the fuck out of me.  I think everyone was applauding when JFK said, hey, Mr. Cod, we will send a man to the moon and do those other things. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know what those other things were.  I love when he said that.  And those other things.  When did it get this bad, though?  I know you always had this, to a point, but now it's like, if you're a fucking Republican and I see you standing up, there's going to be hell to pay.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know how it got this bad.  And I told you, Boehner was in a tough spot last night because he was on TV the entire fucking time.  He couldn't look like an asshole, but he couldn't clap either.  He had to play it right. 
[00:54:00]  He had to play it perfectly last night.  And he's sitting next to Obama's lapdog, Biden, who was applauding everything.  Nodding his head and applauding.  He's like, oh, yeah.  Boy, yeah, yeah.  Harumph.  Harumph.  I tweeted last night because it felt to me he was holding in a fart the entire fucking speech.  Look at his face.  Yeah, he looked like, oh, fuck.  Boehner's just like, Boehner's just looking at the back of Obama going, I really want a straight-haired guy there with a white neck. 
[00:54:30]  Like, that's what he's thinking.  Oh, I'm sure.  But I think what Boehner does, I think you're onto something there, too.  I think if you're in Boehner's position where you're like, okay, I can't show emotion either way and I got to look kind of like.  Fleshlight?  Stoic.  Fleshlight?  Exactly.  Underneath the.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I bet you he's just staring at the back of Obama's head and just.  Looking at skin.  Counting skin tags on the back of Obama's neck.  Anything but listen.  Anything but listen.  Yeah.  That's the only way you get through that, and look how he did. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And the other thing about Boehner, a little observation, he's now darker than Obama.  You notice that?  He loves his tan, and he is darker.  Is it a spray-on tan, or you think he, you know.  Well, he kind of has a natural sun kind of weathered look to him.  You know.  But you think he lays out during lunch?  I think he spends a lot of time out of doors.  During lunch, though?  Out of doors during lunch, yeah.  Yeah, because he takes his lunch outside.  You can't keep that tan going just by doing it on the weekends.  No.  We see a lot of the bruds, they go to Central Park for their lunch. 
[00:55:30]  They lay out.  And they lay out for an hour or so just to, you know, keep their tan up.  I don't know.  I wasn't impressed, but although it would take a lot to impress me, considering it's Obama,  I'll be honest with you, I'm not a fan.  But, yeah, there really wasn't, again, it came across as a campaign speech.  He was fiery.  I think he needed to have a fiery speech because people remember that Democratic National Convention 
[00:56:00]  keynote speech where he really made a name for himself.  It was a fiery, passionate speech, and I think he's trying to get back to that.  But, again, that's more like campaigning than it is having a viable jobs program.  Right now, we're sitting here the day after he gives his job speech not knowing where these  jobs are coming from, how many jobs they're going to be, how long this is going to take.  People aren't going like, wow, thank God, you know what? 
[00:56:30]  He spelt out this plan, and I really think it's going to affect me, and I'm going to get  a job.  Are we going to know more later, like next week?  I don't fucking even know, and that's the problem with Obama, the I don't know factor.  That's what affects Wall Street and the entire economy and the world economy, is this hedge  your bet, I don't know what's going on.  Companies don't want to hire because they're not sure what the fuck next month's going to  bring.  There's no definite plan for a company to say, here's what our forecast is looking like 
[00:57:00]  for next month, the next quarter, the next year, so we can hire this many people, and  we'll be okay.  They don't fucking know, because this guy's got no fucking answers or leadership qualities.  Sorry, I know I'm going to catch shit, fuck you, I'm a Republican, I don't like the guy,  whatever.  But that's how I see it, as me.  And that's fair enough, but let me try to throw some other shit at you.  Sure.  Romney, Perry. 
[00:57:30]  So they move in in a year, 14 months, whatever, right?  A little more.  So you think they could make drastic changes?  I hope so, and they better, or they'll be out in four years.  Like, I just need...  But you say, I hope so, so that means you're like a little leery of the whole system at  this point.  You know what it is, it's so early on in the campaign that I haven't really heard what  their answers are to helping the economy.  I believe you feel like they could do a better job than Obama.  Yeah, I think so, especially with a Republican...  But are they going to be able to make drastic changes that obviously Obama has not been able 
[00:58:00]  to do?  If they also get the Republican majority, yes, they'll be able to make changes.  What those changes will be, I don't know, it's too early to say.  I'm not one of these Republicans that are just saying, they're going to get jobs back  and they're going to do this.  I don't know.  Right.  I haven't heard enough yet.  Right.  I'm still researching these guys and listening to what they have to say.  But I know after over two years of Obama being in office, or two years of Obama being in  here, and him having the majority for the first two years, just about, nothing got done. 
[00:58:30]  Nothing got done.  The economy's in the shitter.  And I inherited it from Bush.  Shut up.  Right.  Right.  Great.  We inherit things all the time from other people.  When you get hired for a job, you inherited it from someone that probably fucked up and  that's why he's not there anymore.  Do you go to your boss and then blame the last guy when you don't get your fucking job  done?  No.  Because then you'll be the fuck out and a new guy's going to be in there.  You know what? 
[00:59:00]  Fix the shit.  I inherited this stumpy thumb.  You see?  But I've made the best of it.  And you did.  I really have made the best of this thing.  You've inherited that.  Yeah.  I barely noticed that I have this stumpy thumb anymore.  See?  Until the listeners bring it up.  No, it's the very cruel of them.  They say cruel, horrible things.  And God decided not even to balance it out.  He gave me one normal one.  That is weird.  You know, an unsymmetrical human body is very odd.  It should be as symmetrical as possible. 
[00:59:30]  And I grow the nail on this one a little longer to give the illusion that it might look like  this one.  Let's get some silly putty.  Pop it on the end.  But I inherited some shit, too.  Yeah.  But I made the best of it.  You've got to make the best.  More importantly, Ant, who was the first fucker, according to Ed in Oklahoma, that licked the  frog?  Oh, to get stoned?  I think our poison ivy bit has legs.  I really do.  There are things that people had to do out there to realize we've got to stay away from  this shit.  And the poison ivy is a good example, because like you said, we were trying out leaves to 
[01:00:00]  make a nice salad.  Yeah.  And someone had to fucking eat some leaves that are poisonous, like poison ivy and others.  There are extremely poisonous frogs out there that probably killed people that even  touched them in the wrong way, and then maybe licked their fingers or it got into their  skin somehow.  Yeah.  But I bet they saw something.  I bet they saw a frog, somebody, and saw another creature, like, try to eat the frog  and then backed off.  And then they saw the creature go like, whoa, get all fucked up. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  And said, hmm, maybe I'll get fucked up if I kind of, you know, put that frog in my mouth.  And that's what happened.  And that's how they got stoned.  And I just said it through a microphone.  So now it's true.  What was that guy's name?  Ted Froglicker.  I didn't even hurt a rotten ball bag, Spectro, you asshole.  Rotten ball bag.  I was on vacation, and I chose not to shower as much. 
[01:01:00]  Oh.  Because the pool and the ocean seemed to keep everything clean.  Now, you wear boxers?  Boxer briefs, sir.  Oh, okay.  See, that's really sealing in the crispness.  Sealing in the goodness.  Sealing in the freshness.  Sealing in the goodness.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of goodness down there.  You probably want something that breathes a little more.  Yeah, I guess.  Whatever.  Like your balls breathe.  I got to get some jock itch spray.  I'll be fine by Monday.  Jock itch.  You want to take a break?  Yeah, I want to eat.  So lobsters sucked at first, and then we decided they were good. 
[01:01:30]  And took them away from the Negro slave, apparently.  The Negro slave.  Back during the Civil War days.  So you think the slaves had a good laugh?  Not many laughs back then.  Like, damn, this is good.  But they're like.  These assholes are giving us this shit?  Yeah, they're in the fucking sheds and the barns.  Yeah.  Late at night as the slave owner just throws a whole bunch of lobster down.  Lobsters.  Here's your shit food lobster. 
[01:02:00]  And they're like, all right, Maza.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But there was a time they were like, holy shit, they have no idea how delicious this  is.  And then there had to be a lookout guy to make sure the white guy doesn't come by to see  how delicious it was.  The white guy, like the plantation owner walks by and he just feels like, God damn, this  is good shit.  Oh, man.  You know, that's how it turned around.  Some idiot slave fucked up.  It's like that lobster's good shit.  And expressed how good his damn lobster was. 
[01:02:30]  When the rest of them are like, oh, man, lobster food.  The plantation guy's like, what are you doing to it?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, we fucking take it.  We steam it.  And then we throw in some of this, you know, southern fucking hot stuff and spices.  And then we take some lard, some fucking, some of that lard they'd give them for some shit.  And then we melt it down and separate it and then dip the lobster.  Wow.  Let me try that.  Yeah.  That's all it took.  No more lobster for the slaves.  And then they made him the house, you know, and he's the guy that cooked and cooked the 
[01:03:00]  lobster.  And they were like, this is fabulous.  Right.  So he got a good gig out of it.  And the rest of the slaves had a sofa.  Oh, was he getting stink eye from everyone else though in the shed?  What do you think they replaced the lobster with?  Oh, fuck.  When they took the lobster away from the slaves.  Like pig's feet and shit.  Just fucking that lousy, shitty pig's feet.  Pig knuckles.  They just chopped off pig's feet and gave them that.  Ankles.  Yeah.  Not even the feet.  Here's an ankle.  Now make this taste good. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Yeah, let's eat.  Yeah, let's do that.  Rich Voss today.  Yes, Voss is coming in.  Jim Brewer.  I do believe Brewer.  That's always fun on a Friday.  Brewer is hilarious, as we all know.  But we might change gears a little bit today because he has a new documentary out that  is fucking serious.  What is he documentary-ing?  He decided to take his, at the time, 83, 84-year-old father on the road.  Oh, right.  Who's got some issues.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's older.  And 30 days with his father on the road. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  I saw the documentary yesterday.  It is fucking good, man.  It is really good.  Crazy, huh?  And there are laughs in there, by the way, but it's also very fucking deep.  Yeah, because it's a horrible thing that his father's gone through.  Is there a trailer for this damn thing?  Is that the actual trailer right there?  Oh, you want to hear the trailer?  Oh, let's hear it.  Strong language, it says.  Preview contains strong language.  98X Charleston's Rock Station.  Hello, Jim.  How are you?  Very good.  How are you?  What's going on with you now?  Obviously, we've got a huge tour. 
[01:04:30]  This is going to be a little different than probably what you've seen in the past.  Do you love the news on SNL?  Do you love it for the movie Half-Bake?  Make some noise for Jim Brewer!  Oh, Jesus.  He's on tour with Jim Brewer Sr.  Don't shake your fucking head.  I do have a diaper for the elderly man that hasn't gone to the toilet yet.  You can't do water in the pot? 
[01:05:00]  Hey, really, don't stop your wheelchair.  It's all good.  Yeah, really, rush to work.  The first time I really had to take care of my father was two years ago.  He just kind of gave up.  So I decided, you know what?  Let me give this a shot.  Keep your hands warm.  Whee!  Do I want to wash another man's yo-yo?  No.  I knew he needed to get out of the house.  I knew this would give him so much life.  Your ass needs a haircut. 
[01:05:30]  Trying to fork me?  I'll go shit in your bonnet.  Why don't you go sit outside?  I love getting a rise out of him.  Yeah!  Look out!  Look out, yeah!  He's getting at the point where if he's not in the mood for it, it's kind of fun to pull  it out of him.  You want something to play with?  What'd I do to my paint?  I don't know.  What'd you do to your pants?  Oh, that's just a wee-wee.  This tour really was to take care of him.  You know, he's not going to be here much longer. 
[01:06:00]  My dad will not say, hey Jim, I love you.  But I know he loves me.  He knows it's there.  I know it's there.  So, do we have to describe the whole thing?  Or do we use what has worked forever?  Laugh it.  Good night, Muffy. 
[01:06:30]  Love you.  Good night.  It's called More Than Me.  Wow.  Yeah, it's pretty...  That's very sad.  There's a lot of laughs in there, though.  It's some dark comedy shit, man.  I watched the thing yesterday and it fucking made me miss my goddamn dad.  Someone's going, what a bummer.  Play something funny now, please.  Oh, we got something funny.  I promise you we do.  That is a bummer, man.  Wow. 
[01:07:00]  It's brutal.  I mean, it's brilliant.  And I'm sure it's put together like amazing.  Jim is hysterically funny.  And he'll bring the humor out in it.  But just watching that, it's like, oh my God.  Oh my God.  Brewer is a really just solid, nice guy in the end.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  He's just a really nice guy.  I don't know if the trailer does it justice.  Because it's...  I didn't...  I wasn't bummed out.  Nah?  Nah, not really. 
[01:07:30]  It's a little bummage going on there.  Yeah.  We better play something funny.  Yeah, we will.  But Brewer's coming in to talk about more than me.  That's cool.  I think it's going to do very, very well.  I believe this will be in some festivals.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  It's a great idea.  It's a great concept.  Yeah.  And he absolutely pulled it off.  It's great.  So...  Good for him.  All right, Brewer coming in at 8 o'clock to discuss that and other things.  I think he has a pizza man update.  Oh, great.  That fucking guy. 
[01:08:00]  I think he has a pizza man update.  I love that.  And like you said, Ant, we need something funny.  Yeah.  Well, we're all working for the weekend, aren't we?  Oh, thank God, yes.  And it is Friday, isn't it?  It's Friday, man.  Friday, Friday.  Friday, Friday.  Before that famous Friday song, there was another Friday song that a lot of radio guys enjoyed playing.  Oh, hell yeah.  And that would be Working for the Weekend.  We've got a live version.  We sure do.  You want to play that now as we go to break?  Oh, please.  Hit it.  I like to sing, man. 
[01:08:30]  I'll sing a little bit.  Everyone's watching to see what you will do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Oh, everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight?  Everyone's trying to get it right now. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, everyone's working for the weekend.  Everyone's working on the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  You want a piece of my heart.  I was born and raised in New York City in a housing project way up in the hood. 
[01:09:30]  I dressed in dark clothing, so folks started calling me black girl.  Oh, and they used to laugh about it, because deep down they knew they'd call me that, because I was as black as soot.  I've always been a lazy man.  I've always been a lazy man.  A couch potato with a clicker in my hand.  See, motivation I never had.  Hit in the shadows when the boss got mad.  For 20 years I never got a raise.  I'm 33 and I've never been late.  I look busy, but I'm not. 
[01:10:00]  I'm just walking around.  I pick up some papers and I put them back down.  Today I'm gonna stop paying my rent.  Live in a refrigerator box.  Never get out of bed.  I'm black girl.  A genuine lazy bum.  I'll always make it through.  Hard times at any double year.  Then one day some lame brains came and took Owen A away. 
[01:10:30]  And at the age of 33, I felt like I was carrying the weight of the whole station on my shoulders.  And Ronnie Fessy knew what I was going through.  Every morning I'd unlock the door.  Lay down and I'd sleep a little more.  Then I'd put away the bathroom key.  Everybody was depending on me.  I eat a chicken wing with lemonade.  Lord, give me strength to make another day.  Times I felt I couldn't go on. 
[01:11:00]  Push a button, throw a switch, answer the phone.  Got lost in the van, I did my PSAs.  Ten minutes work gonna take me all day.  I'm black girl.  A genuine lazy bum.  I'll always make it through.  Hard times at any double year.  I could hear Scott's old say,  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum. 
[01:11:30]  You'll always make it through.  Hard times at any double year.  Ken and Jeremy say,  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum.  You'll always make it through.  Hard times at any double year.  This is the virus, Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow. 
[01:12:00]  Black girl, the vibe manager over at the Hard Rock New York City.  That's what we learned today.  I wonder how many people understand that song.  I know, right?  Because we get new listeners all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a...  And losing listeners all the time.  All he knows is that, too, sure.  Oldie but goodie, that one.  You only lose them because of money, not because of talent.  Is that it?  Thank you, Sir.  Wow, Rich Voss.  Thank you so much for that.  Thank you.  Rich, with a compliment right off the bat.  Thank you.  I feel like I'm a new man.  It's nothing but compliments, because... 
[01:12:30]  Is it a fire?  Well, the meanness has done nothing.  Ever since Tough Crowd, all the meanness.  Yeah.  It's just...  And the meanness around you guys and the meanness around my friends.  It doesn't work anymore.  You think it's coming back at you a little with the fire and everything?  I think with the fire, with gigs, with my belly, my golf game, I think everything is falling apart.  You don't want to show off your abs today?  I could still flex my...  I still have nice abs if I flex, but if I just sit down and let go, like a normal... 
[01:13:00]  ...person and quit fucking holding it in for 23 hours in a day, so my back hurts and I'm cramped all over and I can't shit because I've been sucking my fucking horrible gut in.  That's why I don't want to take a fucking picture with these horrible fans.  You know, your face is all fucked up, because, yeah, I'm fucking all tensed up, okay?  Why is your face all fucked up?  Because he's tense.  Like that, you're fucking tensing up.  He's always flexing.  It's like you're shitting.  Well, let's back up a little bit, because everyone needs the update.  Last we heard, you lost everything. 
[01:13:30]  In a fire.  Yes.  And I told you in the hall, the main thing I lost was my hope.  Yes.  Hope.  Hope was in that condo.  Hope was in the condo.  He lost that.  Because I asked him, well, welcome to the club.  We've fucking lost it ever since we started working here.  Yeah, don't go home with hope, see?  Yeah.  I asked Rich, I'm like, yeah, what's the most valuable thing you lost?  And he goes, my hope.  I thought it was going to be some kind of antique chair or something.  No.  No, I lost my hope.  It was in there. 
[01:14:00]  This fire, by the way, for the people that don't know, Rich Voss's condo went up in flames.  And everyone is blaming Rich Voss's condo, because they're saying, remember I just said  an hour ago, Ann, how these fire marshals know how fires start?  I don't understand the science of that.  But they're saying that the fire started on Rich Voss's balcony.  That's what you're saying.  And it took out seven condos, right?  Six or seven, yeah.  Six or seven condos.  So Rich hasn't been back there, obviously.  He's living out of a hotel.  Well, I go in and out. 
[01:14:30]  But how long have you been in a hotel now?  About a month, yeah.  A month.  A month.  Oh, this is a month ago already.  Pretty much.  Not only from hotel, you go from room to hotel.  We went to Hilton Head, back.  Stuff in storage.  So everything is moving.  Tomorrow, we're getting an apartment.  So you're talking to the neighbors?  Huh?  So you talk to the neighbors?  They must love you.  You knock on their hotel room and say, hey.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, you're the guy that started.  You're the guy that ruined our lives.  Here's the thing.  Because I was in California.  Stupid Bonnie was home.  He thought I was a bad profiler. 
[01:15:00]  She's the fucking worst.  And I said this last time I was in the air, but I'm more equipped now that Opie's here  and not just fucking dumb Anthony and Norton trying to run the show.  Okay?  I need a fucking...  Shut up.  I need an anchor to listen to the story.  No divide and conquer here, sir.  No, there's none at all.  But you know what I'm saying?  No, actually not.  You're rambling whether Opie's here or not.  Okay.  But what I'm saying is, I was in California.  Why are you doing this today?  Me and Anne are actually getting along. 
[01:15:30]  And we're really enjoying each other's company.  I'm not trying to divide.  No, you guys are...  We're really enjoying each other's company.  Believe it or not.  There's signs everywhere say Opie and Anthony.  And that's how I...  When I go to bed at night, I can't wait to do fucking Opie and Anthony.  Okay?  I don't go...  I can't wait to...  I'm doing Opie and a little Anthony or some of Anthony and Opie's here today.  It's Opie and Anthony in my head.  But we do pull it off.  Huh?  We pull it off.  There's many different combinations in this show now.  I'm telling you.  And I'm very comfortable with Sam sitting next to me now instead of... 
[01:16:00]  What do you call it?  Danny?  Yeah, instead of...  What's wrong with Danny?  Nothing.  There's nothing wrong with Anthony's tumor.  Jeez.  What are you doing?  Wow.  Did you decide to come in here and burn this place down too?  No, shut up.  You can't burn a fucking...  It's already been burnt many years ago.  Okay?  Oh my God.  You have no bridges.  Stupid fucking walkover.  What happened to the negativity you were trying to get rid of?  It doesn't last. 
[01:16:30]  The meanness.  Did you start by saying I don't want to be mean anymore?  I don't, but it's just...  You're taking more shots today than you've had in years.  The fucking vibe in this fucking horrible condemned fucking radius.  Rich, is that actually the condo right there?  Uh, yeah.  With the fire department there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Which one was yours?  Uh, the one that's burning.  The one that's completely engulfed in flames.  No, the whole thing is burning.  The one where there's a black eye running out of.  No, point to the one that was yours. 
[01:17:00]  Because I really don't know.  Because there's a lot of fucking smoke and fire at this point.  Uh, the main, right there.  Oh, right there.  Huh?  Yes, the BMW under there.  Okay, here.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  So, I gotta help you out a little bit.  I gotta direct you to this slightly.  Okay.  So, Bonnie smelled smoke for an hour and did nothing about it?  What happened?  Okay, we both are kind of to blame.  She calls me.  I'm in, in fucking, uh.  That clip's gonna be used during the litigation part of this fucking thing.  Sacramento.  I'm in Sacramento.  Sacramento. 
[01:17:30]  I'm outside Rancho Cordova.  And she calls and says, I smell smoke.  So, I'm thinking, well, go on the internet.  Maybe there's a fire in Hillsborough, in our town.  You know, maybe she smoked in the air.  Go on the internet.  How about go outside?  Well, that was the next thing.  Fucking, listen.  Your advice was to go on the internet because she's smelling smoke.  Because you never think it's your house on fire.  You think there's a fire in the town.  I live in a building now.  But if I smell smoke, I'm getting out of my building.  I'm gonna take a little walk around.  Okay.  Why don't you take a little walk around?  Well, if you walk around, you're gonna fall 400 stories. 
[01:18:00]  So, okay, Jesus.  Because I said I was leaving the building.  So, that didn't make sense.  Well, no, no.  Our building's different.  Okay, she called me and said, I'm gonna.  30 seconds from completely attacking, by the way.  What, who, me?  Yeah.  I'm not attacking.  I'm back to normal.  We're not gonna allow your meanness, sir.  Okay, I'm not mean.  Okay, listen.  This is nice, good morning party radio.  It's party Friday, isn't it?  No, but okay.  So, you told her to go on the internet. 
[01:18:30]  I don't get that.  If you're smelling smoke, that means the fire's close.  You don't have to be on the internet to figure out where the fire is.  No, she didn't say, I smell smoke in the building.  She said, I smell smoke outside.  Right, okay.  So, I thought, you know, throughout the city, there's a big fire.  That's a normal.  Okay, so, she goes on the balcony.  Where the fire is burning, by the way.  Well, and supposedly sells smoke, and other people in the townhouse smell smoke, but no 
[01:19:00]  one sees smoke, but they smell it.  So, the next call I get from her is, the house is burning.  Not like, not like it was burning before, because she was very calm, but now it's a  panic.  The fucking house is burning.  Now, I'm 3,000 miles away, so, I go, you get the car out.  Well, my golf club's first.  Well, the kids, the kid, the golf clubs, the car.  Car, yeah.  Okay, I had one set on the road with me, because I have two sets.  I travel with one, and I play with one at home. 
[01:19:30]  So, I said to her, did you get, and she's outside now panicking.  Now, I'm panicking, because I'm 3,000 miles away, and I just think everything I own is  going up in fucking flames.  Everything.  You know, the car is right under it, so I think, oh, shit, this is a new fucking BMW,  you know, 328 XI, 2008, 25,000.  See, yeah, it's not brand new, because thank you.  Right, right, right.  I said 2008.  When he said that.  And he didn't buy it in 2008.  But, okay, so, it's an almost brand new car. 
[01:20:00]  Almost.  That's fair enough.  So, now I'm panicking.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, I have to do one.  I'm on the phone with Continental to fly home.  I'm calling the club and saying, well, you can, I'll do the first show, but you got to  get somebody to do the second, because I'm getting the fuck out of Dodge.  All right, now I'm going to slow you down again.  How the fuck, as a comedian, we're going to get serious for a moment, then we'll get  silly again.  How do you fucking go on stage and do a show knowing your house is burning, and that you're 
[01:20:30]  going to be leaving soon to rush home?  Well, I packed my stuff, I threw it in the car, I ran into the car.  And here's the problem, not only that, knowing I can't sell DVDs after the show, okay?  That's the major thing.  You know, oh, I don't, you know, I can't sit here and go, here, so, so I'm on stage.  I don't know how you do that.  And I'm in, well, because I'm a pro, and I'm one of the best comics in the country, and  we'll get to that in a second, with these fucking clubs, this scumbag in Pennsylvania.  We'll get to that.  But I'm doing the show, I'm doing the show, okay? 
[01:21:00]  And I'm on stage, and the whole time I'm thinking, my house is burning, and I'm having a good  set, and I'm not, you know, I'm not killing that guy, I'm having a good set, and there's  some 45-year-old drunken fucking asshole, just a Yahoo drunken audience.  I go, really, sir?  Really?  This is how, you're 40-something years, this is how you act?  You don't know what's going on in my life.  But did you tell the crowd that there was a fire?  Towards the end of my show, I did like five minutes on the fire. 
[01:21:30]  And you probably thought you were bullshitting, right?  You could tell I wasn't lying.  Okay.  Why, are you crying?  Huh?  In my car earlier, as I was driving in, I just started freaking out a little, not crying,  just enough tears, you know, kind of like the tears you get when you hear someone's  doing something on TV, that type of tears, and it's not you.  So, you know, kind of like the tears you get when you hear other people in the building  are getting a raise, you know, tears of, really, when will it stop tears? 
[01:22:00]  This is going to lead to a benefit.  We're going to have to do a benefit for Rich Voss, a fire benefit.  Rich Voss lost everything, please help him.  Yeah, as your radio listeners' parents, drop him off at the benefit and give him a $5 check  for me.  Here, give this to him, and I'll pick you up at 11.  What are you trying to say about our listeners?  You need our listeners.  All right, I need them.  Why do they stay?  They stay.  Wow.  They're nothing but instigators and troublemakers.  You can't say that about our listeners.  Only we can say that about our listeners.  Fucking that one guy on the message board, BIV. 
[01:22:30]  I hate him.  I hate one guy.  I don't even know him.  But if I could kick his ass, I would.  I don't know how big he is, so I'm just saying if I could.  I wouldn't worry about it.  So, anyhow, back to, so I do the show and I get on the fucking radio.  But now I'm in fucking West.  I'm not going to get home until tomorrow afternoon.  The good thing is I got bumped up on both legs to first class.  I got bumped up.  That's the good thing.  That's good.  After your house is on fire, you want to be able to relax.  You're like, oh, this is what it takes to get in first class. 
[01:23:00]  So, I'm watching on the plane.  I should tell them my house is burning all the time so I can get this first class seat.  So, I'm watching on a plane, Inferno.  That's how you looked when we were hanging with Dickie Betts?  That was Ashbury Park.  Jesus, you were fucking ripped.  What are you doing?  What were you wearing?  That's like a weightlifting outfit.  Okay, first of all, what am I doing?  A story with slideshows of my past?  That's what we do.  Jesus.  He's narrating a slideshow.  It's like a memorial. 
[01:23:30]  Why are you mad that we're saying you were ripped?  Huh?  I mean, the choice of the shirt is a little weird.  It was an outdoor 200 degree fucking show you guys were doing.  Describe that shirt, Ant.  It's not even a muscle shirt.  It's like if you took a wife beater, right?  Yeah.  And then you grabbed the bottom of it and pulled it down to your feet.  Okay, good.  How the straps of your arms would stretch down to where the neckline is now about mid-abdomen.  You made your t-shirt into suspenders. 
[01:24:00]  The fact that you emphasize pulled down makes it seem like there's no shirt, it's just suspenders.  But what that shirt is, that's a powerlifting shirt right there.  Was that your I'm going to try to get laid t-shirt?  Well, it's not even a t-shirt.  Really?  At an O&A event, I'm going to try to get laid?  There were always a few.  A few, really?  If we put them all together, that's one set of teeth.  Now we're up for a gang-banging?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:24:30]  No, there's some cuties that come to your show.  There's Dickie Betts the day after he allegedly had some shenanigans in a hotel room.  And he got kicked out of the home.  How bad do you got to be to be kicked out of a drug-induced band?  It's like, how fucked up would it be?  You got to be pretty bad.  How fucked up were the doors where Woodstock said, you know, maybe not?  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't have these guys on.  Let's have Hendrix and Joplin.  Yeah.  All right, now you're in first class.  I'm in first class.  Your house is burning, but you're enjoying the flight back, aren't you? 
[01:25:00]  Well, I'm getting a little rest and relaxation, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I'm a little tired.  I get back the next day.  It's me and Kid Rock.  You know, we're hanging out.  Me and Kid.  Yeah, the slide show continues.  There's some good stuff on there.  You and Kid Rock.  Remember when we get to Christopher Walken, we got to look at the pee stains in his pants.  We've seen those before.  Really?  Right there.  Oh, that was the one where he came out of the bathroom and there was a little wet by 
[01:25:30]  his zipper.  I pissed myself.  Where is that from?  Out in the bathroom.  Yeah.  He might have been washing his hands.  He might have been washing his hands and it splashed.  We never talked to Walken, so where is that shot from?  Oh, that was at Richard Belzo Roast, where Paul Schaefer was hosting.  That's great.  That's a great shot.  All right, you're relaxed in first class.  Rich, as your condo's burning and Bonnie's freaking the fuck out.  Yes.  Was there a nice in-flight movie for you? 
[01:26:00]  I don't even remember.  I don't watch those horrible movies.  I put my movies on my iPad that I bought for Bobby, overpriced.  All right, go ahead.  So I get back, I get in my car, and I drive there, and the first thing I do is see a detective  and a fire marshal.  And the fire marshal's a big fan of O&A.  Because he said when he went into the house, he goes, no, not Voss, right?  Oh, shit. 
[01:26:30]  Because he sees my fucking posters in the hallway of some of the big things I've done in the business.  You have posters of yourself in the hallway?  Well, then I just have a couple, like the Oscars, and, you know.  I'll give you that.  You know, at this point, posters or pictures?  How big?  Well, the Oscars, I got, here's the thing.  I got a big thing from the Oscars with the, you know, the statue.  And in the corner, I have Rich Voss, writer.  All right, that's legit.  That's kind of cool.  I'll give you that.  Yeah, because it's mainly the Oscars posters. 
[01:27:00]  It's not a Rich Voss.  And then I have one poster where, New Year's Eve, I was on the Sony Trinitron screen doing comedy.  They taped it in advance and put it on the, you know.  On the what?  Sony Trinitron, whatever the fuck it's called.  What's it called?  I believe at some point it was called the Jumbotron.  Okay.  Sony Trinitron was a type of television that was put out years ago.  Uh-huh.  It used, I believe, squarer pixels. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, I used to have one of those.  The round pixels.  I was.  But the Jumbotron.  The Sony Trinitron.  I was doing a gig for this guy, and he didn't have my money, so I took his TV.  And it was a Trinitron.  A gig or a drug deal.  What the fuck is that?  When you're taking people's televisions and shit, it's usually drug-related.  So, what was that?  Oh, so some of the posters.  So the fire marshal.  Big fan of the show.  Really big fan.  Okay.  You know, because when we were going over everything, he said, how can't, you know, he wanted me to 
[01:28:00]  figure it out being that I'm an FBI profiler, he said.  Uh, so I'm talking to the detectives, and Bonnie didn't like the detective, because he was fucking  smashing her.  You know, she was on the bed when it was happening, reading tarot cards, okay, or whatever they're  called.  Yeah, right.  Tarot cards.  Tarot cards.  Tarot cards.  And he says to her, he says, he says to her, he says, were you burning incense? 
[01:28:30]  He says, well, I'm not in a fucking cult, right?  And he was really grilling her, but that's his, that's his job.  He's got to find out if it's arson or if it's, you know, some kind of stupidity.  Negligence, yeah.  So, I liked the guy, because he was an ass.  I didn't know you had a son, but.  I liked the guy.  How do I have a son?  Our son.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Ooh.  Hamburger.  Hamburger. 
[01:29:00]  Quack, quack.  So, I, uh.  Ooh.  Okay.  Ooh.  That was a good one.  Okay, so now they start, said it started.  And I think this is wrong.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It started in the court.  The only thing on my balcony was an aluminum or metal table and two aluminum chairs and  a dry.  Rough for him.  A dry.  Well, what else do you put on your fucking balcony?  No, that's not what he's talking about.  Just saying aluminum is very rough.  That was.  Aluminum. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You got, you got through it, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Or metal or whatever the fuck with glass.  Okay.  That, uh, and a dry plant that I don't even remember, but Bonnie said there's a dry plant in  the corner.  Yeah.  So, what they think is, is starting in the plant.  Yeah.  But I don't think that because Bonnie walked out and other people smelled smoke, but no  one saw it.  Where, what would have ignited the dry plant?  Yeah.  How do you think Bonnie started the fire?  I wouldn't, I'm a hundred percent sure she didn't start the fire. 
[01:30:00]  Oh.  A hundred percent.  One, she doesn't smoke at all.  It's burning.  Well, the world is turning.  What's that?  Manlight it.  We tried to fight it.  Right.  And here's the thing.  The insurance companies, being that there's six or seven other insurance companies, they  would like to go after my insurance company.  So, they're asking questions like, you know, insurance companies will go after anything.  If, if it's a defaulty grill, hey, they can go after that.  A defaulty grill, you got to.  Yeah.  First of all.  You got to go after the defaulty grill.  A defaulty grill.  Anything defaulty. 
[01:30:30]  Holy mother of Jesus.  Okay.  All right.  There's a fucking, you know, you know, some kind of, so they're asking questions, you  know, one, we're not allowed to grill.  We've never grilled on our balcony.  You're not allowed to.  We go to the park to grill amongst the other Latinos.  We sit in a park with a bunch of fucking running Latinos screaming and my little daughter  thinks she's Puerto Rican, you know, by the end of the day.  And, you know, it's fucking horrible. 
[01:31:00]  We go there with nice turkey burgers and we end up eating these fucking big fried bananas.  It's fucking horrible.  So, we go to the park to grill.  So, why do you do it?  Why do we do it?  Yeah.  Because we want to grill every now and then and we want to take the kids to the park and  have a day grill.  It's the only time you can grill, yeah.  You can't grill.  You can't grill there.  It's a $500 fine if you get caught.  Wow.  So, you're grilling anyway.  What's that?  So, you're grilling anyway?  Never once.  Because a fire could start like it did.  And I'm confused.  Where are you grilling?  In the park.  And that's where you get the fine? 
[01:31:30]  Where do you get the $500 fine?  If you grill.  At the park?  No.  No, on the balcony or on the property.  Or even in the garage, the carport.  Oh.  Well, you shouldn't grill in the carport.  Oh, well, it's opened?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a carport, not a garage.  All right.  Well, you say garage first.  Sorry.  I didn't say the garage.  I did.  I did.  You said the garage and then you said carport.  Okay, the carport.  All right.  All right.  So.  You want to hear from a woman whose daughter lost her condo because of your carelessness?  Say again? 
[01:32:00]  We got someone that also lost a condo.  One of your neighbors.  Are they calling in?  Yeah.  I'm sorry I'm interrupting you, but I don't want this person to go anywhere.  Okay.  I don't want to lose them.  Her name's Kate and she's in Jersey and she has a lot to say.  All right.  Let's speak to Kate.  Kate, what's up?  Oh, actually, it was a woman I worked with.  Wait.  Hold on.  I can't hear her.  Hold on.  Tell her to hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Hello?  Where is she?  Wait.  Hold on.  All right.  Go ahead.  You got it?  Okay.  Go ahead, Kate.  Hey, it was actually a woman I work with.  She started telling the story and I stopped her for a second.  I'm like, wait a minute. 
[01:32:30]  Where does your daughter live?  And she's like, hell, girl.  Now, you'd think my response would have been like, oh, I read about this in the paper.  But instead, my response was, oh, I heard about this on Opie and Anthony because  one of the comedians that I listened to, this was his house.  Yeah.  And she was freaking scumbagging you.  She was like, oh, I started off.  They're all playing with the losses.  Wait.  Wait.  Hold on.  I'll get to this point, though.  She's got a good point.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Kate.  Continue.  So, she's like, oh, they're smokers.  And I'm like, well, obviously, you don't listen to the show because he's been on Nicorette 
[01:33:00]  for like five years.  Five years.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And I guess he must have said to the daughter, like, unless Nicorette can start a fire, like,  it couldn't have been cigarettes.  Well, here's to her.  She did not have nice words to say.  But I think she was like, wow, you're being scumbagged out there.  You are.  They're bad-mouthing you.  I think she was mad that I was sort of defensively.  Like God did.  Well, here's to her.  You know, I can see her.  And that's what. 
[01:33:30]  That's what.  I'm sorry.  See, and they're not.  You know, they say it started there, but it could have started in the wall somewhere  and just shot out there.  Yeah.  Okay.  If I was a fire marshal, I'd be very suspicious of the bosses.  I would.  Because, you know, first of all, you fucking idiot.  They listen to the show.  Sorry, but I don't.  Okay.  You're going to be suspicious of me.  I'm 3,000 miles away.  Well, that's alibi.  Huh?  Bonnie's got something going on.  Maybe desperate times means desperate actions. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  A lot of times.  Collect on the insurance money.  A lot of times when people start fires in their buildings, they do it outside.  They don't do it on the inside.  They go, you know what?  Let's do it outside where the fucking whole world can see me.  You fucking idiot.  That's why you're not a profiler and I am.  Fair enough.  But how are they saying that this thing started on your balcony, but all you have is the aluminum  room, the table and chairs.  And a dry.  And a dry plant.  Well, how does the dry plant go up?  Well, maybe if you'd listen, you need fuel, an oxygen source, and ignition. 
[01:34:30]  Okay.  And can I have the fuel?  Can I put you to rest?  You have the oxygen source, which is, of course, the atmosphere.  And you need ignition.  What was it?  How do we know?  And people cut through.  Okay.  If you look around this whole building, there's balconies everywhere.  Okay.  Sounds wonderful.  What floor are you on?  We're on the first.  First floor.  So there's two other floors. 
[01:35:00]  I see where he's going with this.  Okay.  One, a cigarette could have been flicked into the dry.  The fire marshal would have found the cigarette butt.  They would have found it if it didn't burn away along with that.  I mean, it burnt pretty much most of the wall.  I think a cigarette butt could be burnt.  I don't know.  I've never burnt a cigarette butt.  I don't smoke them that far down when I smoked them.  A kid walking by could have flicked a cigarette up, and it landed between the cracks of the fucking balcony through the wooden crack and smoldered in there without smoking, and boom, took off. 
[01:35:30]  Three, it could have started somewhere in the wall, which they might find out when they got the place.  Four, the...  Now, this is a wild one.  Four...  I could see him on the stand just losing it.  Four...  I think you're full on the questioning.  Four...  Four...  I've never seen Vos go to four.  I know.  Four.  This could be scary.  Four... 
[01:36:00]  Four...  Four...  The aluminum metal chairs, which can act as a magnifying glass from the power of the sun, reflect into the plant.  Boom.  Fire.  That's all I'm saying.  And you know a little bit about science.  I need that on Mythbusters.  And here's another one.  Yeah.  There was a mercury storm that day.  A meteorite storm.  Not a mercury.  A meteorite storm.  A meteorite.  A meteorite.  A meteorite.  You're saying a meteorite perhaps might have hit your head.  That's what one of the detectives said, and I looked at him, I go, you can't be fucking for real. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  So that's far-fetched, the whole meteor thing.  Yeah.  But that's in case of emergency, and we have to go to it.  Uh-huh.  Now, the glass on the table...  And the metal.  Is it...  Well, the metal wouldn't do anything, but the glass acting like a magnifying glass.  A reflecting glass.  It's not...  It wasn't plain glass.  It was the kind of glass where there was like aluminum under the glass where it...  It's like a mirror?  It's like a mirror-type glass.  So mirror glass.  So where would it be reflecting onto?  The dry plant. 
[01:37:00]  The dry plant.  Is it concave or convex?  Or is there any way the light would bend and amplify itself?  No, I think it was...  I think it was Ikea.  Holy shit.  Fair enough.  He answered your question.  He certainly did.  In just the fashion I wanted it answered.  Listen, here's one thing.  So here's why Bonnie hates it.  Because they all look at her like it's her fault. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Which, you know, I would love a fucking answer.  Because no one likes unanswered questions.  Well, especially when there's a fire in your house.  You know, OJ, you want to know the answer.  Natalie Holloway, you want to know the answer.  Amanda Knox or Cox or whatever that...  I think Amanda Knox is innocent, by the way.  I think now we have to just...  And they're not giving her any conditioner in Italy.  She's a pretty girl, but her hair is very, very unconditioned.  She could look very good.  She could actually dethrone Casey Anthony as my favorite felon. 
[01:38:00]  So you want answers.  Okay.  Yes, you do.  You want answers.  Very wholesome look to her.  I know.  Holy shit.  Look at her dry hair.  She's in your club.  She really does have some dry hair.  Jesus Christ.  And Casey Anthony, rumor has it, marrying a very rich, wealthy man.  Very wealthy man.  And they're going to Mexico.  Oh, Casey Anthony, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  There's another...  Oh, man.  Look how pretty she is.  Look at her, right?  Dude, take a look at fucking Amanda Knox, right?  That's some fucking model material right there.  That's nice.  She's a pretty girl.  She really is.  Spuck there in Italy.  Too bad she's a killer.  No, she didn't do anything.  I'm on her side.  Free that bitch.  That's what I say.  I'm on her side.  Yeah.  Fucking horrible Italian fucking girl.  Everyone's looking at Bonnie as the arson.  Well, here's the thing.  I mean, you know how rumors spread and they're all by the pool and, you know, Bonnie goes  to pick up our kid at daycare. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, boy.  And the lady at daycare said, yeah, I heard a fire started in Hillsboro from Christmas  lights.  Oh, fuck.  So, I mean, you know how rumors spread, really, from Christmas.  Of course.  You know?  So, you know, if there was an answer, I really think it's electrical.  I'm serious.  I'm going to go with something.  You think there's something in the wall?  Something.  Because the building was built in the 80s.  Yeah.  Okay.  And there's mice.  And nothing lasts from the 80s.  And there's some mice.  Oh, ew.  Oh, so they're chopping at the wires.  That's what I'm thinking.  So they could be heating the wires, something shorted out. 
[01:39:30]  Well, I've caught mice in the basement, in the storage.  I don't know if they're in there.  I've never seen one in my house, but I've seen them.  He's in the wall, and he's nibbling on some wires.  They're in the walls, and rats and mice have caused a lot of fires.  But I'm not going against these fucking...  These firemen...  Sounds like you're going against the firemen.  No, these are some CIA fucking guys.  CIA?  No, I mean CSIs.  I'm getting...  Listen, this is...  CSIs.  He's cracking.  No, I'm not.  These are some Benny Davis eyes.  You thought you guys had the perfect scheme, didn't you? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And now it's all falling apart in front of your eyes.  Yeah, it was a big scheme.  It was a big scheme.  Go on the balcony.  Take the grill.  You know, what kind of scheme?  What would we...  I don't know.  You seem like you guys came up with the perfect crime.  Let me ask you something, Rich.  The perfect crime, Bonnie wouldn't be here.  But they're sniffing around a little bit right now.  I gotta ask, Rich.  They're supposed to be.  What do you have to gain from this fire?  Nothing.  What do you have to gain from...  It's nothing but...  Insurance money?  No, I'm losing.  No, no. 
[01:40:30]  How do you lose?  Okay, here's how I lose.  Okay, you want to know how I fucking lose?  Do you want me to give you like 20 ways or 10?  Wow, we just got past four and we were amazed.  Did you make it to 20?  One, the major inconvenience of me bouncing around...  He was great in the military.  Major inconvenience.  Oof.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Jimmy's not here.  I gotta throw a bomb in.  I might go over on red-eye, but not here.  Jesus Christ.  I don't like this mean risk.  Okay, two, the major inconvenience. 
[01:41:00]  Three, things that...  I'm kind of obsessive-compulsive and like a hoarder.  No.  There's things I have.  I have golf shirts that I've never worn from special places, West Palm, Innisbrook.  Okay?  Gone.  Gone.  All right?  I have...  Bonnie did it together.  All the richest shit.  Luckily, all the pictures of my kids growing up were in one of those metal trunks.  Can be what?  You had a safe?  The fact...  Yeah, I had a safe.  You had a fireproof safe?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  I had two of them.  One with the movie stuff in it and one with my valuables.  That's interesting.  So the documentary stuff, all fine and precious moments, the pictures and everything, all fine.  And he's trying to throw the fire marshals off by saying these valuable golf shirts that  he's never worn.  Well, hold on.  I'm not even done yet.  I'm not done yet.  I'm going to go with Jewish lightning myself, but...  Okay.  Yeah.  You had something to gain.  I had nothing to gain.  I have nothing to gain.  The insurance company's not going to pay this back?  Of course they are. 
[01:42:00]  I've been paying insurance for them.  And what you get...  See, we park it out back last night, and we tell the insurance company, when we woke  up, it was gone.  What's that?  The insurance company gets your brother another car.  Who'd that happen for?  It's flounders.  Here's the thing, too, you don't know about me.  Here's the thing that you don't know about me.  I'm 25 years sober.  I do the right thing in life.  If someone gives me extra money back, I give it back to them. 
[01:42:30]  You're doing the right thing in life until a toe trigger on a shotgun.  No, Rich.  Here's the thing.  Why do you give the money back?  I just figure, in the end, it's all a wash.  Well, not at all, because I try to save as much stuff as I could.  When they're going through the house going, oh, let's junk this, let's junk that, I'm  going, no, we can save that.  Okay?  Like hoarders.  It's like watching hoarders.  So people, my father's going, get your own adjuster.  Look, I only want what's mine.  I want some clothes, some electronics, my Picasso painting. 
[01:43:00]  There's just a couple things.  You don't have a Picasso painting.  I had a Picasso painting.  You don't.  No one has a Picasso painting.  You might have a print of one.  No, I have a real, original Picasso.  Frank Picasso, who I went to school with.  So, it's nothing to gain.  This is probably the worst experience of my life.  When I was in the hospital with a fucking breakdown, it wasn't as bad as this.  Wow, you were? 
[01:43:30]  You had a breakdown once?  When I was like 21, 22.  When you were in the hospital.  It wasn't a breakdown.  It was anxiety.  But it came across like a breakdown.  So, what they didn't know is they were giving me Thor's all and Hal'dal, and I was doing  laps around the hospital, like one flew over to Cuckoo's Nest.  Rich, by the way, we only have five more minutes to feel sorry for you.  I'm not trying to feel sorry.  We're on a tight schedule, so can you wrap this up?  I'm not trying to feel sorry.  Oh, really?  What wrestler do you have coming in today?  I don't do the wrestlers.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Brewers here.  Oh, really?  Do you have a fucking drummer? 
[01:44:00]  Go ahead.  Do you have a drummer that used to play with Tony Bennett or something?  Nobody gives a fuck.  I don't get that one either.  Neither do I.  I'm just saying you've got a horrible guest coming in.  You're panicking.  Get out of your nose.  I'm eating.  Get out of your nose.  Our guests have gotten better.  We already had a wrestling segment.  You with the English language.  That's good.  I like that.  Thank you, sir.  I didn't say put the bacon in the omelet.  Anyhow.  So what happened?  So.  How do we wrap this up?  So.  A benefit. 
[01:44:30]  I knew it.  So you were in a hotel.  Uh-huh.  She called.  I came back.  Now the insurance companies, you know, they want to blame somebody, you know, because nobody  wants to pay, you know.  So, like, you know, hey, did you have a grill on your balcony?  No.  Do you make coffee on your balcony?  Who doesn't?  No.  Oh, so they're trying to, like, put the blame on you so they don't have to pay out as much  as possible.  Or put the blame on an appliance, a defaulty appliance.  You know, does your daughter have a meth lab? 
[01:45:00]  She's four.  You know, things like that.  I mean, they were so good, these detectives, in, I'm starting to think, you know what?  Maybe I did do this.  I was 3,000 miles away.  I'm going, these guys are good.  I'm going, you know what?  Maybe I am at fault.  Maybe it is your fault.  You know, and when you're going through your clothes in the basement after your other  clothes burned, and you're looking at shit like La Tigre going, you know, it was in style  once.  You know? 
[01:45:30]  It's still...  Maybe I can get a couple days out of it.  You're a hoarder.  You're a hoarder.  I'm trying to save what I can.  There's nothing to gain out of it.  There's nothing.  Because the kitchen that we remodeled for $15,000 might have to be gutted.  The new floor I put in last year...  Oh, right.  We remember the floor.  Okay.  So, the bathroom tiles, all of it, you know, nobody wants to go through that kind of remodeling  and that kind of bullshit again.  All right?  I'm not trying to sell my house, because no one's trying to sell in this market. 
[01:46:00]  Someone, Sean is saying if it was a meteor, it's considered an act of gag.  Yes.  I don't think it's a meteor.  And insurance won't cover that.  Oh, they would cover that.  Cover it.  Can we make a Cribs video?  What?  Walk through your burnt out condo and make a video?  I don't know.  If it's legal, yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  Why wouldn't it be legal?  Yeah.  Why would it not be legal?  I don't know.  It's your place still, isn't it?  Oh, and they fucking came to my house.  One of the insurance companies went out calling me and just ripped the locks out and went in 
[01:46:30]  to look.  They just fucking kicked the locks out.  It's a crime scene.  It's not a crime scene.  This radio fucking studio is a crime scene.  Yeah, we get it.  We suck.  You've said it many times.  No, you don't suck.  You don't.  What happened to I'm not going to be me anymore?  You don't suck.  I'm telling you, there's potential here.  I'm telling you.  You're no Bob Wolf.  Oh, what?  Bob has been showing you sympathy?  Is that what's going on here?  Fuck my friend Levy. 
[01:47:00]  What happened?  Levy was working for him?  He went up there for months.  He's working.  He thinks he's going to be the new guy.  He's almost relocating.  And they go to do the contract.  They go, nah, we don't need you.  And he was there for like fucking two months.  Oh, bullshit.  Levy would be great.  He was great on the show.  Anyhow.  So you're living out of a hotel.  You're not going to be in your condo anytime soon.  We're getting an apartment.  You're getting an apartment.  Yes.  They're going to.  And Bonnie hates it.  That's another thing.  She doesn't want to live in the apartment.  She hates it.  It's not the nicest place in the world.  Yeah, but it was. 
[01:47:30]  It smells like a curry festival.  You know.  A what?  A curry festival.  Oh, I said curdy.  Curdy or curvy.  I said curry.  I said curry.  Don't try to make mistakes when there's no mistakes.  No, you just said curdy or curvy.  I kind of heard curvy or curvy or something.  Yeah, it wasn't curvy.  But it's so inconsequential now.  Yeah.  I don't know.  At least everyone is healthy and alive there, Rich.  Oh, enough with the fucking stock answers.  Oh, you know.  Oh, everybody got out okay.  You know, possessions can always be replaced.  I love that one.  That's right.  You know what a pain in the ass it is?  Living life on life's terms, you know. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, you heard that one too?  Yeah.  One day at a time.  Go fuck yourselves.  What?  My fucking house just mulled all over.  All over my fucking furniture now.  Because of the water, right?  Yeah.  No, because it's old.  Yeah.  Well, it could be because it's old.  No.  You have a lot of antiques.  Like I said before, you would think after all these years of fucking Bonnie's dry pussy,  we would have started a fire.  Nothing.  He's got a nice pussy.  I don't know.  And, okay, so now I'm dealing with that. 
[01:48:30]  Do we need to hear that?  In my head, you're just dealing with...  Last night I was going to bed.  Can you summarize?  Because we really are on a tight schedule.  What I'm summarizing is, it's a major inconvenience.  I don't wish this on anybody.  The Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Department are fucking great.  They really...  How are they great?  Because they couldn't...  You have to cut your cut, though.  The whole building could have burned to the ground.  These guys were there and fucking put out a fucking...  No offense to the Volunteer Fire Department, but it can't be great if you're thinking about 
[01:49:00]  the fact that they have to gut your apartment and you're not going to be back there anytime  soon.  Yeah.  They got to gut it because of water damage and fucking mold and smoke.  They could have...  It could have been fucking burned to the ground if these guys weren't fucking on top of things.  All right.  Fair enough.  That's true.  You know?  Fair enough.  And they're volunteers.  Like I said before, they didn't have to go.  They...  No, it's not...  That's not how that works.  He doesn't understand a volunteer fire department, which is hilarious to me.  What do you mean they didn't have to go?  They're volunteers. 
[01:49:30]  If someone asks me to volunteer at a club and do a show, I can go, you know what?  I'm not doing it.  So they could do that with fires?  They're volunteers.  They're not on payroll.  You can't get fired from something you're not getting paid from.  They're volunteers.  You know what?  They volunteer to come put out my fire, and I thank you for volunteering to do that.  Okay.  Okay?  Now, anybody in the building that thinks we did it...  Like the guy next to me.  Yeah.  And above me, you know...  They're all suspicious and mad at you, right? 
[01:50:00]  No, because they know we don't...  They're bad-mouthed.  People are making fun that you remodeled your kitchen for $15,000.  Tech punch him.  Why?  How much does it cost?  He goes, what did he replace the fridge?  No, I have a small kitchen.  $15,000?  $15,000.  I have a small kitchen.  We put cabinets in, a new refrigerator, stove, you know?  I kind of...  I could see that.  It's a small kitchen.  Yeah, go fuck your trailer trash park bullshit.  $15,000 is enough.  Wow.  Your trailer trash park bullshit.  Yeah, I'm sick of these fucking guys that try to question the Rich Voss. 
[01:50:30]  You know?  I don't question the Rich Voss.  So, did we summarize and do the story justice?  Yeah, there's no answer.  And there will be an answer, I think, when they get to the place.  We're going to see a fucking wire.  And everybody's going to go, oh.  And it might even be in somebody else's fucking apartment.  And then I have to apologize to Bonnie.  Because you already accused her.  When do you think you and Bonnie are going to be arrested for this?  Yeah, when is the warrant being served?  Probably a week before the movie comes out. 
[01:51:00]  This is a very publicity.  This is a very different Voss.  You're panicking.  I'm not panicking at all.  I couldn't be any calmer or funnier.  Okay?  You're being funny.  If I was panicking, you would see this food all over the fucking table here.  Oh, we will.  I'm sitting out of my mouth.  We will, no matter what.  There's no panic.  You're a sloppy.  Everybody would take a lie detector test.  You know?  Great.  It's no big deal.  Oh, me?  I was in California.  You're in the clear.  You have an alibi.  But that would be suspicious to a fire marshal and a detective.  Really?  That stand-up comic that travels was working a weekend? 
[01:51:30]  Maybe if he saw my act, it would be suspicious.  I'm sure someone has said, conveniently, you have an alibi.  Yeah, exactly.  You're on the other side of the country, I see.  Correctamundo.  You know, when Martin Luther King was shot, I had an alibi that weekend.  How come I'm not thrown into that mix?  Oh, racist.  Huh?  What?  You know what?  Get Danny back.  He didn't talk as much.  Oh, man.  What's Bonnie's alibi?  Yeah, what is her alibi?  Tarot cards.  Tarot cards. 
[01:52:00]  I love this.  She was reading Tarot cards.  Not one card said, hey, dummy, your fucking house is not...  Isn't there a danger card?  Yeah.  How do you say that?  Because now I don't know.  It's Tarot.  Like Tarot cards.  It is, right?  With an O?  Okay.  It's spelt with a T at the end.  Oh, because now I'm not...  All right.  Tarot cards?  Yeah, it's T-A-R-O-T.  I know that, but I don't know how to...  Yeah.  After hearing him pronounce it, I don't know how it's pronounced properly.  And she was eating popcorn.  Oh, shit.  Oh, well.  And here's the other thing.  No one is going to start their house on fire with their four-year-old there. 
[01:52:30]  They would go take their four-year-old to a babysitter.  That would be so suspicious.  Yeah.  Yeah, I took it to a babysitter, but I'm home.  Yeah.  Because my house goes on fire.  That's exactly why you do start the fire when you have the four-year-old in the house,  knowing you can get out in time and you throw everyone off the path.  Right.  Off the scent, I should say.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You start your house on fire, you got the four-year-old, and people are like,  of course you didn't set the house on fire.  You wouldn't do that with a four-year-old. 
[01:53:00]  I think the four-year-old's not happy with her parents.  Or maybe she was playing with matches.  Start of the fire.  There's no matches in the house.  You know what?  I'll tell you another thing.  What?  As a kid, I used to shove like tweezers in the fucking electrical outlets.  Isn't that good?  Oh, here's another thing.  If it started on the balcony, do you think that the four-year-old walked past Bonnie in  our bedroom to the balcony, took the wood out of it, because I put wood down there to  open and close the door.  Oh, the rape stick.  Yeah.  And unlocked the door and had the strength to open it and snuck out in front of Bonnie and 
[01:53:30]  played with matches?  Well...  Okay.  And then left...  Bonnie probably opened up everything, got everything set nice, and then gave your little  daughter like a lit candle.  Said go play.  There was no candle there.  Bonnie looked around.  She's been thinking about this for a while.  Here's what I think.  Okay.  Here's what I think.  Fair enough, right, Ant?  Who's...  And be honest with me.  What?  Whose idea were the iron lock boxes for the fire stuff?  I know you. 
[01:54:00]  It's probably Bonnie's idea to say, let's get our movie put in some...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Stop.  I bought the fucking fireball.  You bought them.  Who...  Whose idea was it?  Me.  Did Bonnie say...  No.  Rich.  She's not smart enough.  This fucking dumb bitch couldn't get to Walmart yesterday.  After seven years, this dumb fucking bitch.  Okay.  She's brilliant when it comes...  She has no common sense.  Okay.  That's okay.  All right.  I bought it.  Question answered.  But the thing is, okay.  They were bought.  That might... 
[01:54:30]  And how long ago did you buy them?  Over a year ago.  Okay.  It might...  When we started in a movie.  Okay.  That might have been when the wheels started rolling.  Two years ago.  She's thinking the valuable stuff is put away.  She goes, I hate everything else in this fucking house.  Rich will not get rid of it.  You know what?  She's told you stuff over the years that she wanted to get rid of, right?  And you wouldn't.  So she decided, I'm going to burn this motherfucker down.  Wouldn't she burn it down when I'm in bed?  Because I'm one of the things you want to get rid of.  I can't wait to see this on Law & Order. 
[01:55:00]  I know.  This is going to be great.  Ripped from the headlines.  Okay.  I say you're very suspicious still, unfortunately.  Yeah, there's some kind of suspicion going on.  I'm not.  And I think your neighbors are suspicious of the bosses.  Well, they should be.  I think the detective a bit suspicious.  But I'll tell you what.  When they find out the truth, the neighbors are going to fucking come up.  First of all, I don't even talk to my neighbors.  Go fuck yourselves.  Yeah, right.  I'll tell you what.  The neighbors in the other buildings that aren't connected, very nice.  Yeah, you didn't burn their fucking houses down.  And no one asked you. 
[01:55:30]  Who cares if they're very nice?  You didn't burn their houses down.  The one guy who lives upstairs from me doesn't even know there's fire.  He was just going out for the night.  And he's walking down to his car.  And he sees the building on fire.  So he rushes in to my house to make sure everybody's opening up.  Oh, what a guy.  Yeah.  Was Bonnie able to save anything from the house except the baby?  She grabbed her pocketbook and her phone.  Oh, there you go.  Convenient.  The Louis Vuitton.  All right.  The Louis Vuitton. 
[01:56:00]  What about your Louis Vuitton?  Oh, you had it with you?  No, that fucking thing is so smoke-dammit.  His man pocketbook.  No, not the one I keep my computer in, the one I travel with for clothes.  But that justifies everything.  Oh, it's totally done.  Now we're all in.  No.  We're so happy this happened.  We couldn't be happier that you lost that goddamn man purse in the fire.  That thing stinks literally now, right?  No, but not the computer bag.  I have a carry bag.  Right, right.  But I'm trying to get it clean. 
[01:56:30]  I'm not trying to get money.  I said, do what you can to clean this.  Fuck that.  I would take advantage of it.  Toss everything and fucking get a check.  The drug companies take good advantage of you.  What's that?  Toss everything, get a check.  No, that's the problem.  I would take advantage.  Not me.  Oh, you're going to save the country by fucking saving a stinky Louis Vuitton bag?  You're going to be the one guy that does the right thing and then in the end  they don't give a fuck about you?  Get the fuck out of you.  It's legit fire damage.  It's not a fraud thing as far as we know right now.  I'm suspicious.  Are you on the side of me?  Something's going on. 
[01:57:00]  Something's going on.  I think Bonnie...  We've heard the desperation in both their voices the past couple years.  I'm afraid Rich is in the clear.  Let's go back to the tapes.  I think Rich is in the clear.  I think Bonnie started this to get rid of a lot of Rich's stuff and then fessed up to  Rich.  So now they both know and they're trying to hide it.  And you kind of know Bonnie from being in here.  Yeah.  So do you think if she wanted to get rid of maybe my golf clothes, just think, do you  think maybe she would have just took them in her hand, walked that back and thrown them  in the dumpster?  No, everything.  Your couch, that giant couch. 
[01:57:30]  That would cause probably a relationship.  The antique furniture that isn't really antique.  It's just old.  You know, all that shit.  She wants a nice new place.  No, she doesn't.  She started that fire.  She's not smart enough.  Here we go.  Here's the music.  Listen, what I'm saying?  What did I tell you?  Can we get a couple of detectives in here and they could talk to you and Bonnie?  Anytime.  Yeah.  How much fun would that be?  Can we do that legally?  Oh, yeah.  If it's detectives that have no. 
[01:58:00]  Can you wait till after we get our insurance check and then we'll do it?  Maybe.  Maybe you should get the money first.  Imagine that.  We have him on the show and totally fuck him out of his insurance settlement.  Oh, that would suck.  You guys have fucked me out of everything else.  Broken fucking arm.  You know, Rich, that's hurtful.  We've been nothing but really good pals over the years.  Oh, yeah, really?  Yes, we have.  Boy, they're flocking in the ONA fucking fans.  We'll see how many come to Boston next week.  Oh, yeah.  When stupid Bobby Kelly or Patrice or Billy's in Boston, they pack the theater. 
[01:58:30]  I'm in a hundred fucking seat room next week.  They're from Boston.  They got that whole fucking town.  Okay, that's a good point.  That's a good point.  You do well in Jersey, right?  Yeah, you do well in Jersey.  You do well in Jersey.  You do well in Jersey.  Yeah.  I was doing well in Philly, but they cut my money.  Bastards.  Where are you going to be tomorrow night?  Because we've got to move on.  Oh, tomorrow night's the Berkeley Conneret in Asbury Park.  Bonnie and I will be working together.  We're on the fire tour.  Yes.  No, tomorrow night's the Berkeley Conneret. 
[01:59:00]  It's supposed to be really cool down there.  I don't know.  You know, Rich is a very funny comic, and now that he has this fire thing, I would absolutely  go out and see him.  Yeah.  You've got to be adding some of this fire shit to your app.  I added some stuff.  I did it all on the radio today.  All right.  Then we'll rework it tomorrow night.  And then Boston next weekend, where?  Motley's.  Motley's in Boston.  I don't know where Motley's is.  That's Friday and Saturday.  It's in Faneuil.  Oh, it is?  Faneuil Hall.  It's the new comedy club in Faneuil Hall?  Yes, small place.  It's a cool fucking club.  Is it the same room as the old days?  No, no.  This is like a hundred seat room.  It's my favorite type of room, where you sit on a fucking stool, and you're a genius. 
[01:59:30]  And you just chill.  And you're a genius.  I'm a fucking genius.  Wow.  I did a show at the Hilton Head at the Celebrity Golf Tournament last week, where I just get  a tweet last night.  I played five fucking straight days of golf.  Five days.  The tournaments are six-hour rounds, five and a half.  Okay, the last day, which is Sunday, Saturday night, I had to do a show.  After three hours of auctions and cooking demonstrations and this and that, now I got 
[02:00:00]  to do a show and be clean, which I killed, okay?  I'm fucking fried.  The next day, Sunday, I still have to play at Harbortown.  Four hours sleep after all of this.  And the guy, I get a tweet last night, the fireman you played with said you were an ass.  Really?  Really?  Can you read fucking people?  My back was killing me.  I was ready to, I was going to walk off Harbortown and go sleep in my car.  I was so fucking tired.  I'm sorry I wasn't doing backflips for the fucking New York firemen. 
[02:00:30]  And I carried these motherfuckers.  I had four or five birdies in the tournament and they, fuck them.  You know, it's so close to fucking 9-11 and you're bad-mouthing the fucking firemen.  No, I didn't bad-mouth, I bad-mouthed the golfers I played with.  You just said, fuck them, firemen.  I don't know.  That's a tweet.  9-11.  All right, boss.  Oh my God.  Now that you're done with your breakfast, I guess we could go to break now.  Yeah, I'll eat something too.  They weren't bothered by that at all out there.  No, no, they love it.  That you were eating your entire breakfast during the whole story.  These guys have been eating for seven years.  No, we stopped. 
[02:01:00]  I'm not talking about food.  I'm talking about food.  You've been shitting for seven years.  Fucking nuts.  Jim Brewer joins the program next.  Balls.  Sheriff, it looks like we found another body.  This is the third one this week.  I think it's about time we call in the FBI.  Somewhere out there, a killer is on the loose.  Why, yes, Sheriff. 
[02:01:30]  I have been following that story in the papers.  It used to be such a peaceful little town.  And there's only one man who can catch him.  Now, don't you worry.  I'm going to send my best man down there to help you in your investigation.  But he was busy.  Here comes fucking ferret face.  Whatever.  All right, Agent Voss.  Someone's out there murdering innocent women.  I want you to go down there and assist the local sheriff.  You're one of the bad.  Get down there and help the sheriff.  How could he be a profiler?  His vocabulary is so bad. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, but no one listens.  This summer, the Opie and Anthony show presents a comedy about an idiotic comedian pretending to be an FBI agent.  So you work a lot of murders before?  Now we're doing mainly a lot on terrorists and terrorist-type threats and stuff like that.  But, you know, back in the day, it was more murder.  What are some of the cases you worked on?  I guess, you know, Seattle, the Green River.  What do you call it?  Look, I can't talk a lot about it.  I don't get this much in detail.  Starring Jim Norton. 
[02:02:30]  He just keeps saying profile, profilers.  Other profilers, profilers.  And Rich Voss.  Great minds think a lot.  I like, oh my God.  The profiler.  Coming to a theater nowhere near you or anyone else.  Thank baby Jesus.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  I want to give a big fuck you to my boss, whose little bitch pet is a DWI in a company fucking vehicle.  And he doesn't do a fucking thing about it except change him around. 
[02:03:00]  And now he can't even handle the fucking workload that he's given.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Hey, I want to give a huge fuck you.  All the oxygenarians in Nassau County that voted no on the U Arena for the Islanders.  Every interview you heard, you heard,  Oh, I'm afraid of the future of the county.  You're afraid of the future?  You're 93 years old.  You're first.  I hope you'll fucking die.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yes, I'd like to give a big fuck you to my cousin Anthony.  So he decided to turn me on to the New York Met. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, I've always been a Jet fan my whole life.  And instead of giving me a good team to fucking root for,  he gets me into the Mets.  Thanks, pal.  Now I have two teams that could rip my fucking heart out all year long.  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to send a big F-2 out to my hometown police department.  I went there the other night to ask them if they could help me out and tell me what to show these drugs I had.  They took my drugs and threw me in jail.  Fuck you! 
[02:04:00]  I want to give a big fuck you to the guy who gave a fuck you to Kings of Leon for canceling their court.  Fuck him for being a pagat like the Kings of Leon.  They suck a dick.  And of course, the bitches.  Fuck you, asshole.  Fuck you!  I just got a mind of fuck you to give out to this little bitch-ass specialist from 1-9 build artillery Fort Stewart, Georgia  that just had me fucking walk back and salute a goddamn commander because he was fucking...  I was walking with my head down. 
[02:04:30]  You want to fucking dress me up and yell at me when we're the same rank.  You know what?  Fuck you, little specialist!  Take you out to the wood line, fucker!  Fuck you!  Yeah, this FU goes to my former boss and my former employer.  He didn't even have the common courtesy to come and fire me in person.  He had to do it over the phone.  Fuck you, you fucking pussies.  And I know you can hear this FU because I know you're a daily listener, Matt.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  Call the O.P. and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1. 
[02:05:00]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The show's getting better and better.  Jim Brewer in studio. 
[02:05:30]  Love this.  And Rich Voss having a meeting with Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  As we try to do our radio show.  Rich always tries to...  Rich is always wheeling and dealing.  I'm not wheeling, Jim.  I've known Jim Brewer since he was in Florida, since we did a hot wing contest out in the  parking lot.  Wow.  Out in the parking lot about 25 years ago.  We were testing hot wings and doing a show.  I don't know if you remember.  Were you drinking back then?  That was outdoors in Florida.  It was a hot wing contest.  Were you drinking?  I might have just stopped.  Wow.  I was probably about a couple months over working Fort Lauderdale. 
[02:06:00]  Must have been a treat.  And it was a big outdoor wing ding.  Wait, wait, wait.  So you're a comic, you go down there to do your thing, and Jim is local at this point  because he lives in Florida.  Yes.  Like E-Rock.  I don't know.  Do you remember this?  I don't remember yet, but...  Maybe it wasn't you.  Oh, shit.  Maybe it was Phil.  I'm trying to...  No, it was you.  Okay.  Okay, it was in the afternoon.  They had this...  Your glasses fell.  Don't step on them.  Yeah, yeah.  They had a...  All the hot wing places around Miami, Fort Lauderdale had a big festival outside, and 
[02:06:30]  I don't know if we did shows or they just brought us down to be judges for the hot wing thing.  Wow.  I don't remember that at all.  I thought only DJs had to do hot wing practice fucking things.  Because I had to do one.  I was a stupid fucking DJ spinning records.  You sure?  Yeah, you didn't have to do that.  Well, get your apron on, because you're back on your way.  I don't even know what that means.  I would just retire. 
[02:07:00]  I have fuck you money.  Unlike you.  You don't even have a house.  So shut the fuck up.  I'm leaving it.  I got a few money.  You don't even have a fucking house.  So shut up.  Where's this guy get his balls?  Coming in here.  Fucking living in Super 8.  Fucking wife and kid.  Right.  Man's 50 years old.  You got no fucking plug.  You got no rug.  I feel like what movie was Judd Hirschen when he was running on the lam with his wife and  kid years ago? 
[02:07:30]  Uh-oh.  I love when Rich brings up movies.  Look it up.  All of a sudden, I just start getting like, oh, no.  Judd Hirschen on the lam.  I guess he was playing that fucking guy that bombed something.  He was portraying.  Forget it.  Just forget it.  Hold on.  Wow.  How many years ago?  What year?  What year are you talking?  Oh, please.  You had a fucking tool belt on.  That's how long ago it was.  Rich came in here, Jim.  He's really angry.  Rich came in here and basically told us he doesn't want to be mean anymore. 
[02:08:00]  And then he doesn't want to be mean anymore.  He's never been meaner.  But then he's never been meaner.  He's incapable.  You're incapable of being nice.  Of course he is.  You're incapable of being nice.  Bonnie says, she said, all my kindness gets thrown out of the window in my boogers when  I fling them out.  You fling your boogers out the window?  Yeah.  And she goes, that's what started the fire.  Hey, it's the Y100 Wingding.  Was it the Y100 Wingding?  No, because this was 20-something years ago. 
[02:08:30]  But maybe they were.  It couldn't have been around then?  Do you think they really have had a 20-year fucking promotion?  Yeah, radio stations don't last that long.  All right.  We're going to look up the Judd Hurst movie for Rich.  But I want to get to Brewer here because Brewer's in.  I know.  And I went out there to talk about his documentary, which we will eventually.  But he said he almost did not come in here today.  Why?  You're going to love this.  Oh, no shit.  You're going to love this.  Let me strap in.  You look a little tired.  You look a little disheveled.  I'm haggard. 
[02:09:00]  It was a long night.  I'm haggard.  Yeah.  Now, you know my parents are older.  All right?  Sure.  My mom's blind.  Her one eye droops.  The one eye that's missing.  She's a missing, disturbing-looking eye.  They had a halfway sew it shut because it would get bacteria in there.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  Right.  When she's missing the eye?  It's a dead eye.  So it droops.  And she's always got a tissue. 
[02:09:30]  And she's wiping the...  Because the juice just comes out.  Holy shit.  Fucking...  I can't go to dinner with her.  It's mortifying.  Time sucks.  Time just blows.  Time really sucks.  What?  Hollandaise sauce again?  Oh, Jesus.  But...  But...  Now, my dad...  My dad has...  He's got AIDS.  All right?  They come eight in the morning.  He's got AIDS.  Let me clear that shit.  That's why...  Assistance.  Okay.  He has assistance.  Okay.  He forget that one.  So the assistance will come in. 
[02:10:00]  He'll help him wipe his ass.  Get him out of bed and all this jazz.  He's got these bruises all over his arm for these medications.  Now, my mom in the past has been vicious.  I mean, my dad shakes from like Parkinson's, but he's had his whole life.  When I was a little boy, I said, why does dad shake like that?  My mom like, well, it was the war and his nerves are shot. 
[02:10:30]  And I bought that.  Yeah, yeah.  I bought that.  Shell shock.  I bought the shell shock.  It makes sense.  Three years in the South Pacific.  It makes sense.  Sure.  Now, but now...  So anyway, here's the phone call I get.  Now, this happened about a week and a half ago.  My sister calls.  She's like, I can't talk.  I can't...  I think I want to kill our mother.  I fucking...  I hate her. 
[02:11:00]  I hate her.  Holy shit.  What's going on?  I can't...  I can't even talk about it.  So what's...  What is going on?  So my dad lost his hearing.  All right?  But this has happened before.  He gets so much wax in his ears.  They clog down.  Holy fuck.  And they clog the hearing.  Yeah.  And you have to go to the hospital and they drain.  They pull it out and drain out.  And literally, like a huge golf ball chunk of goo will come out.  It's just... 
[02:11:30]  It's disgusting.  Bigger than what comes out of your mom's eye?  Oh, stop.  A little bigger.  A little bigger.  Rich.  Yeah, vicious rich.  Vicious rich.  No, it was nice, though.  It was nicer.  It was just a question.  It was just a question.  It was more of a question.  It was more of a question.  It was just a question.  I'll give him that benefit of the doubt.  So, she goes, oh, my God.  She was...  I heard...  I heard Dad screaming.  And I turned the bedroom.  And she had open hands just pouncing his ears. 
[02:12:00]  Like, just pouncing both ears.  Like what you do in a movie fight.  Yes.  Where you do that movie where you whack the ears with the palms of your hand.  Correct.  So, pow.  And the guy goes, ah!  Yeah, yeah.  Correct.  And then she's pulling his ears, like, really hard.  He's going, ah!  Now, he's in the bed.  He can't even get out of a bed.  He's 88.  So, he's 88 in the bed. 
[02:12:30]  And she's going, can you hear me now?  Ah!  So...  Oh, Jesus.  Bro.  It's uncomfortable.  Terrible.  Now, in the past, in the past, I almost moved him out of the house because I saw him trying  to get out of his chair.  And I came in the bedroom and I saw her shove him back in the chair.  And then he'd fall back and he's like, Jesus Christ!  And she's like, I'm the one that rules you. 
[02:13:00]  And I walked in and went, whoa, whoa, what the fuck is going on?  Are you uncomfortable, Ed?  This is insanity.  They're not getting a divorce.  This is movie shit.  I go, what are you doing?  You know, the eye.  I was just trying to be helpful.  Don't look at the eye.  Where's my tissue?  Let me check on the mail. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, fuck.  And she instantly denies everything.  Like, this is normal.  So, I said, you know what?  I'm taking him out of the house.  I took him out of the house.  He's gone.  He's in my house.  You're never to be around him.  So, she would visit him and, you know, pet him.  I miss you.  And I've never seen my mom affectionate.  I went, oh, maybe she just needed time waves.  The absence makes the heart grow fonder. 
[02:14:00]  Correct.  Yes, yes.  And so, about three weeks later, I left her alone with my father.  Oh, what's going on?  And when I came home that day, he's got this distant look in his eye.  Oh, no.  Like he was captured by the Japanese in 44.  You'll eat the parakeet meat.  This is painful. 
[02:14:30]  He's a war vet.  He's a war vet.  Right.  He survived the war.  But now he's back in the war.  But with my mother.  Yeah.  With her one eye.  And so, she, he goes, I think I should go back to that.  I said, your mother.  I said, why would, why would you want to?  He's like, I, I, I, I should go back there. 
[02:15:00]  I'm like, what?  All right.  So, moving back.  Now, now, you know, a couple things have got, she's nasty.  A couple aides will say like, you know, I think she, I think her nerves maybe are shot.  But, um, I write, report, but, um, she's, she's, you know, I, I, I, she needs help.  I think she needs help.  So, uh, you know, he, I didn't see signs until, um, yesterday. 
[02:15:30]  I get a freaking call.  Uh, now, now, but a couple days ago, I get a, I, I should say this.  After the ear, bang, boom, bang.  Ping, pow.  Yeah, pow, bing.  After that, I immediately found a, um, a place for my, independent living.  So, it's when elderly go there, and they live, uh, like an apartment.  But in case they need something, they got a button. 
[02:16:00]  I've seen, yeah, I've seen those places.  Now, I first went to look for my dad, and the next, the building's next to each other.  You have the independent, and you have where they take care of you.  Where they take care of you, they're like, oh, your father would be good here.  But everyone looks like they shoot him up with morphine.  And they're in the hallways.  Yeah, they leave him in the hallway, like in a wheelchair.  It's just kind of fucking in the middle of the hallway.  Well, that's fresh air for them.  And, right, so they're off their fresh air.  I go there, my mother's there, and I go in, and they're all just sitting in front of the TV.  Yes, zombie.  Right.  And, like, they just had electrical shock treatment, and they're on Thorzine and Haldol. 
[02:16:30]  It's probably not that bad.  They're so happy here.  Yeah.  They're having a great time.  They get three meals a day.  We feed them.  We scrub their balls and their ass.  They're happy.  They're very happy.  We take them to the supermarket.  Oh, God.  We take them.  There's a hairdresser here.  We're happy.  One's yelling, I won't eat pudding.  The other one's yelling, racial fucking.  Right.  Racial epithets. 
[02:17:00]  We put my mom in one of those, assisted living.  Yeah.  But she was on to us, man.  She only lasted six months.  She's like, I'm telling you.  Go fuck yourself.  I know what you guys are doing.  And they're all like.  Move me the fuck out of here.  She wasn't gone enough, unfortunately.  It's all like Jamaican and Haitian employees that fucking, you know, back where they grew  up, they just, you know, they'll throw you in a hut or whatever.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  And it's just different.  It's fucking creepy.  I got to hear the rest of this.  Yeah, of course.  Of course. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  Brewer back on track here.  Okay.  So I'm going, ah, yeah, this ain't going to work.  Well, let's show the independent living.  I walk in there and I went, my mom will thrive here.  There's, she needs other people to talk to.  There's other people missing eyes.  This place is great.  There's people in wheelchairs.  Sure.  She'll make friends.  She'll make friends.  So with that, go home and I go, mom, can I just show you a place? 
[02:18:00]  I show her.  She loves it.  This reminds me of growing up in Greenwich Village.  Oh, really?  I, at the community here and I'm going to put my couch here.  She comes with a tape measure and she's, I'm going to put my couch here and the television  in the corner.  And I had a feeling when I walked in that my father said that you're coming home.  So I, oh my God, this is, what about your poor father?  This is what she said to me, like a sick movie. 
[02:18:30]  What about your poor father?  Say, I'll put him in our house.  We're fine.  We'll keep the AIDS.  Now, she's psycho because the pure hatred comes from, she has to pay for the AIDS.  Now, this is the same person.  She's obsessed and disturbed with money.  Now, let me give you a little sickness about her and money background.  I pay her mortgage. 
[02:19:00]  I bought her house for them and I have my house.  Okay?  So I'm paying through the whole huge overhead.  That's just, that's not employees and work.  Right, right.  That's just my parents' house and my house.  And they're nice houses.  Yes.  So now, with that said, my dad, his whole life, he had a car, all right?  And he couldn't drive anymore.  But he would always sit in the driveway like Gran Torino. 
[02:19:30]  He's the Gran Torino.  He'd sit there.  Gook, shit.  Now, there's shit.  Gook, monkey.  Look at that beautiful thing.  If you want to drive it, go drive it.  You know, if you want to take it to the store, drive it to the store.  What's that time?  Are you going to the city?  Use your car.  Don't put mileage in your car.  I just changed the oil.  He would change the oil.  And so, my mom goes, now this is like a 1980-something Toyota Camry.  If you want the car, I'll give it to you for $10,000. 
[02:20:00]  I went, what?  What?  Seriously?  $10,000.  It's yours.  So, I didn't talk to her for like two weeks.  What year is it?  80-something.  It was like 80.  Yeah.  Honestly, I think it was in 91.  And this is like a couple years ago.  Okay?  10 G's.  So, she wants 10 G's.  Almost 10 years old at this point.  Right.  And she can't.  Oh, no, 91.  She can't even drive anymore.  She can't even drive. 
[02:20:30]  You give me $10,000, I'll give you the car.  Okay.  So, I don't talk to her for two weeks.  After two weeks, she goes, you know, I'm sorry about the car.  I think half is fair.  I don't need the car.  I don't need the car.  I'm fine.  I'm good.  Two weeks later, my sister from Florida comes up, who we call her Crash Patty.  Great. 
[02:21:00]  She's got a lot of problems.  We're just going to say that.  She's on her eighth car and whatever.  I don't want to get into it.  We'll be here for another hour.  I can get her a car for $7,000.  So, my mom, and this is not my father's kid, she comes up, I got in an accident, take our  car.  Doesn't ask my father.  Oh, shit.  Doesn't talk to nothing.  All she knows, the car's gone.  And then for two months straight, she tries to, well, you're senile and you can drive the 
[02:21:30]  car.  That's when he stopped showering, he stopped living for that moment.  The car meant everything to him.  It was more of the, you'd even talk to me about it?  Yeah, yeah.  So, with that, it shows her psychoness with money.  So, now she has to pay.  Now, the AIDS costs $5,000 a month.  Easy.  A little over $5,000 a month.  And some of them just sit and text all day.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:22:00]  They just, you know, you're paying.  Just to be there.  Without thumbs.  That you're paying for, just, you know.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I'm just checking messages.  Yeah.  In case you're a father.  And so, now I start going to the house.  People are sweating in the house.  Come on, what's going on?  I can't afford the goddamn eat.  I can't afford anything.  I can't live here.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I can't live like this.  So, Ma, I pay the air conditioner. 
[02:22:30]  I can't live like this.  I'm going to be out in the street in a week.  My dad makes like $3,000 a month from pension.  Yeah.  That's how great it's freaking pension.  So, I'm like, you're paying $2,000 a month.  You're good for six years.  You're safe.  You don't have to worry about it.  So, a little more, a little more and more.  This is getting a little crazier.  I hear her yelling.  Like, the aides will be putting my dad in the toilet.  And she'll go, you better shit, Jim. 
[02:23:00]  Or in the goddamn home you're going.  Shit already.  It's a war bed.  I got to keep saying that.  And the aides, the lady's like, Mrs. Brewer, it's, I have him.  I have him.  Don't let him shit on the goddamn war because I ain't cleaning it.  Ma, you got a maid.  Oh, fuck.  You know what?  So, yesterday, I'm heading in to do whatever, showbiz, blah, whatever, freaking thing I'm 
[02:23:30]  doing yesterday.  I get a phone call from the head of the agency that distributes the nurses.  Jim, I don't know what happened today.  Oh, no.  But this is all I can, all I can say is you need to, the first suggestion I would make  is to get all the meds out of your family's home because we don't know what your mom is 
[02:24:00]  doing to your father.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  What's going on?  I got a call from the aides this morning saying they really need to talk and they were very  distraught.  And I have to look at the report, but it's something a little more serious, especially  when this girl comes.  Now, this girl's a godsend.  She's a godsend, this girl.  And she said, this is what she said.  She's like, and to hear this woman say it, like she's in trauma. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, shit.  It's like she watched a beating, a mugging go down, and she's in full-blown drama.  And she's like, I've been doing this for 15 years, and I've never seen this in my life.  Oh, no.  And you know she's probably been in the trenches, man.  Oh, she's been in the trenches.  She takes care of Alzheimer's, everyone.  She's seen some fucking shit.  She said she came over the house yesterday, right?  And for some reason, the garage door was open at my mom's house. 
[02:25:00]  Now, there's people working on the house outside in the development.  So every day, she's like, I got to open the garage because they need to get in the garage.  I'm like, whoa, whatever.  All right, all right.  So the garage is open.  She said she walked in the house and heard my father going, God, stop, stop.  And she walked in and found my mother, like, with his pants were pulled down.  And then she turned and saw the aid. 
[02:25:30]  And so I'm just helping him with his pants and then punched him in the stomach.  Just pounced him in the stomach, right?  So she's like, what is going on?  She's like, we're just playing.  This is, we're playing.  Now, in front of the aides, she said she would walk behind your father during breakfast and smack him upside the head and go, who's going to take care of you now? 
[02:26:00]  I'm leaving you.  And then smack him again.  And then she went in the other room to start making the report and start calling.  She didn't know who to call.  She doesn't have my, they're not allowed to have cell numbers.  It's very involved.  So she's calling her boss.  The boss is not answering right away.  While she's making the report, she hears, ah!  And my mom was like twisting my father's arm. 
[02:26:30]  And his skin is so light.  Give him like an Indian sunburn?  But everyone knows he takes these drugs where if you just barely touch him, he'll bleed.  Oh, shit!  Blood thinners, right?  Yes.  Boom it in.  So she, he's getting the open, and she walked in, she said, and he was, she was pulling his ear.  And then, I said, you know, she went in, she broke it up, and now she's disturbed.  Of course.  Now she's freaked out.  I'm freaked out.  Let me get her.  Yeah, yeah.  She goes, let me get him some water.  And she goes, I'll get him water. 
[02:27:00]  And she takes the water, and she puts her hands in the water, and she flings it on his face.  There's your goddamn water.  And kept, so, like, you can't, beyond horrifying.  So, with that, my sister goes up, and now I, now I know why he's got these bruises all over his arm.  And he said, he took the aid when my mom went in the other room, and he said, get me out of here.  Holy shit.  Get me out of here. 
[02:27:30]  And so then she immediately started calling everyone.  Yeah.  But she said this was going on for at least two weeks that she's been there.  And she said, a couple days ago.  Now, my dad almost, he passed out on the toilet, on the floor, because there was something wrong with his bowel movement.  And she gave him, like, she said, don't, the aid was with, like, what are you giving him?  He's like, I'm giving him a laxative and some pills.  And she's like, don't give that to him.  He's going to get very sick. 
[02:28:00]  I know how to do this.  And she goes, this is my house.  You're just an aid.  And she gave it to him, and he freaking pissed and peed and passed out.  And she just sat there, sat there almost, like, grinning.  Jeez.  So yesterday, we were going to call a cop so he can be there until the aid showed up at four.  We got my dad, got him out of the house, into my house.  I call up my mother. 
[02:28:30]  And I go, and I'm very confident.  I said, Mom, do you know I've got four reports of aids saying you've been abusing and hitting and punching dad?  And this is the moment I'll never forget the rest of my life.  I had my mother my whole life.  And it was, like, the most scary moment in my life.  She went, I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh.  I said, Ma, were you in the room? 
[02:29:00]  I was in the room, and I was helping your father.  Where is this coming from?  Mom, are you saying you didn't hit?  You hit dad.  I have reports saying you hit dad.  They are making a police report.  Do you understand that?  I may have shook him once in my life, but everyone is just exaggerating.  I was like, you are a fucking sick, evil monster. 
[02:29:30]  I don't even know who you are.  To hit a man in a bed?  Bedridden to hit and abuse another human in a wheelchair when I'm paying for you to be gone?  You're sick.  And she just was hung up.  I haven't talked to her since.  Wow.  Now, I'd love to call her right now and prank and pretend I'm the police. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, shit.  What about this whole uncomfortable, sad story?  Give Travis the number.  Turn into a prank phone call?  So I was thinking we can...  Wow.  Maybe she doesn't know she's doing it.  Maybe she...  Oh, no.  She knows, Rich, because she has a past.  Yeah.  She has a sick, cynical past.  I was the only child that wasn't abused, and I was the only child out of all of us that 
[02:30:30]  wasn't beaten and hitting and all that stuff.  How many brothers and sisters do you have?  We have all halves.  My mom has...  My mom's like a...  You'll find the joke in that.  Growing up, I would hear people say stuff like, you know, black people, they got like six fathers.  They don't know who their fathers is, and our family's black, because I've got five kids,  all different fathers, and we don't even know half them. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, wow.  My sister's a complete mystery.  We don't know.  And she's got this scar on her face that my mom...  We always said, what...  What the fuck?  What's the scar from, Mom?  Well, when she was a baby, they spilled acid on her by accident.  Who's that?  The ambulance people.  And who has acid just laying around?  In like the 50s.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  So...  How are you alive?  So...  Holy shit. 
[02:31:30]  So to miss out on some great comedy, man.  How are you alive?  And my sister literally went to go have plastic surgery, and you don't really notice it,  because she's a beautiful person and blah, blah, blah, and you just don't notice it until  she goes, you know, the scar on my face.  And then you're like, oh, oh, wow.  And not until last year, I realized it goes all the way down her neck.  And...  Oh, there's another thing yesterday the aide said.  She goes, I came back at four, and I know your father did not pee that much, but his 
[02:32:00]  whole bed was wet.  His feet were wet.  His clothes...  That was not pee.  I really suspect that she was throwing water on him.  And I was like, oh, my God.  Are there burn marks?  Yeah, yeah.  Are there burn marks?  Because he would...  She was definitely capable of boiling water and pouring it on him.  Like, hot boiling water.  Jesus.  So he wasn't burnt, but...  Bro, this is my mother.  This is my mother. 
[02:32:30]  Like, where do...  That's fucking insane.  I'm out of my mind right now.  Oh, shit.  I don't even know what to do.  I don't even know what to do.  Do I hate her?  Do I forget?  Like, I don't even know where to go right now.  Do you have nice recollections?  I do.  Yeah?  I do.  But right now, I'm just...  Like, this happens in movies.  Not in my...  In my...  Jesus.  But I will say this.  It's like whatever happened to Baby Jane kind of stuff.  It's freaking weird, man. 
[02:33:00]  So, anyway.  She's still at the house.  He's at my house.  And I left it with my little six-year-old playing war cards with him.  Yeah.  And she's...  He was laughing.  She was playing with him.  And, yeah, he's in a great environment.  Thank God.  Maybe we saved his life a week early.  Yeah.  I think he did.  Who knows?  I got the question.  So, what is the problem between your parents?  Does she feel like your dad did something way back in the past and now this is a payback?  Or this is just old days?  He holds her back. 
[02:33:30]  He holds her back.  I think.  I don't know.  But for her whole life, though?  She's going to do this to me.  A whole life.  And here's what's sick.  The sick thing is...  Because she's got some, you know, anger in her.  Oh, she's always had it.  But she's had it...  Your father cheated on her or any of that shit?  Never.  Never, never.  Never.  She's the first one that didn't beat her.  Holy shit.  Throughout her whole life, every husband she got made lots of money.  So, there's a man issue there.  There's like a...  Yeah.  Every man made money. 
[02:34:00]  And every man ended up beating and abusing the kids.  So, I'm the only one that didn't happen to.  But my...  Again, my sister.  It's like...  Wow.  Yeah.  They dropped acid on her face.  They.  Acid.  Yeah, they.  Wait a minute.  I said, why didn't you sue?  You didn't do that back then.  Wait a minute.  So, you have a baby.  And while they're delivering the baby in the...  I don't remember what...  It was so long ago.  Uh-oh.  So, then...  So, we're all like... 
[02:34:30]  I think she did...  Like, who's her father?  I don't...  He left.  He left.  Well, where is he?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe you went to jail for this or something.  You'd remember something like...  Of course you did.  Well, your sister wouldn't...  Wouldn't she remember?  No.  No.  My sister hunted her dad down.  Oh, and she couldn't find him?  And she did find him.  But she didn't want to...  She...  For whatever reason, she stopped pursuing it.  Uh...  She got to talk to her for like two seconds.  And I hung up.  But...  Because the...  The... 
[02:35:00]  The...  Plastic surgeon said...  That is a...  That's a severe burn mark.  How did the burn...  I need to know what kind of burn it was.  So, she went to ask my mother.  And she's like...  I don't know what happened.  It's like...  Ma, you don't know how my face burned?  I don't know!  That's like...  A parent remembers how a kid like...  Oh, yeah.  Broke his finger.  Sure.  Or something.  That would be traumatic.  Hey, you know what?  She had...  You know, my dad's kids would come over and she'd squeeze their arms, squeeze their heads. 
[02:35:30]  Talk about how evil they were.  Yeah, man.  She's kind of crazy...  Now it's all like coming back to me.  It's all coming...  Broke her, man.  It's all starting to come back.  I'm so glad I took anxiety medicine before I came in.  Your mom...  I always thought of her as just a sweetheart.  She was.  She is.  Every time I see her.  She has that side to her, where she's funny, sweetheart, but she's got this sick, cynical,  dark, evil side that I...  Wow.  Now I know why we get along, man. 
[02:36:00]  There's some similarities there.  I think your mom has mine beat, but there's a lot of similarities there, man.  Oh, yeah.  That's...  That's...  I don't know many that don't have that beat.  So if you want, if you want, she hasn't taught...  See, but she'll deny everything.  Like, I was going to wait to, you know, like, later with my show, but I'm like, she knows  it's going to be me calling.  No, we'll just give you this tape and then you don't have to work so hard today.  That'd be great.  You can...  That would be great.  This was better than therapy, I'll tell you that. 
[02:36:30]  You did the whole set up here.  You got to call her on our show.  I'll do it.  You want to do it right now?  And we got to figure out what...  Do we call her as a social worker?  Do we call her as a police officer?  Tell her you're giving free tickets to Motley's in Boston.  I'm fucking boss.  Is that where you're going to be, boss, next week?  Yeah.  Boss Motley's next week in Boston.  But tomorrow night it's where?  At the Berkeley Hotel in the Asbury Park. 
[02:37:00]  What, are you setting up your own gigs?  No, I'm doing some...  Yeah, I do set up my own gigs.  Yeah, I do book myself.  Well, I'm saying, like, you rent the room out or something?  Oh, no, no.  Tomorrow I'm doing some kind of show for something.  Sam has something.  There's your thing.  Sam?  There are issues with...  My manager, who you're talking to now, does a lot.  What's that, Sam?  And my agent, who you're talking to now.  Hold on.  Sam is talking about something.  What's up, Sam?  There's issues with calling people.  Yeah, there is.  You have to say...  You're on the air.  And that's why I do it on my show, because I know she'll never sue me. 
[02:37:30]  The alternative would be...  We'll take responsibility for this one.  No problem.  Calling her on a cell phone and then having a one-way conversation.  But if her voice is...  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  No, I know this.  I know that, too.  Yeah, we know the rules.  But because she's, like, 88, I'm always like, she'll never catch on.  And, like, at the end of the day, who's going to sue me?  Yeah.  She can't sue me.  And Brewer's mom loves me, so we're good.  Let's get this done.  Real quick.  And then the other thing is, like, I would do it for my show, because I'd do it right 
[02:38:00]  from my basement when I'm in her house.  And there was one time where I called, and because I really thought she might cheat on  him, and I would call him flirt, pretend I was a neighbor, flirting with her.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, asking her out, and she just wouldn't...  But at the end of the day, she wouldn't date.  At 88?  Huh?  She's not.  This was, like, three years ago, so she was 82.  And I knew her whole background, so I'd be like, hey, Doris, this is Frank, and I used 
[02:38:30]  to work at Pan American.  I heard you...  Pan American.  I used to work at Pan American.  That's why I gave you a call, and there's some new great Chinese plays in town.  I love Chinese.  So do I, Doris.  So do I.  And I don't think we're too old to at least, you know, have good conversation.  I believe the same thing.  When I'm married, bring your husband.  Bring your husband.  Hey, it's not too late. 
[02:39:00]  Get crazy, right?  What am I telling you?  And I'd strung her along for, like, 45 minutes before, and then she finally was like, I don't  know.  And she hung up and called everyone, like, this man keeps calling me and hitting on me.  I go, what are you going to do about it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  So I, back to your question, I don't know what, I don't know where her evil, like you  would think.  Because your dad hung in there, you know, he didn't leave her ever, right? 
[02:39:30]  He would never say anything, but he would never trash her.  So he was a great influence on her life.  There has to be a hatred of men.  Something that she picked up on that might not have been there, that she has been just  holding inside for a long time.  Wow.  We got to call her either way.  We have to.  I tried that with Bonnie.  Pretend I go, hi.  She goes, where?  Well, can we do, we could do this.  We can, if you're worried about, if you don't want to.  I'm not worried about shit.  If you don't want to.  Well, here's the take. 
[02:40:00]  Here's the one I want to ask.  Do I call as me and confront her again?  That'd be good.  Because she'll just totally, totally deny everything.  That's the, I can't get it.  After talking to her yesterday.  Or do I try to shake her up as an officer?  No, you call and say you're with a social worker.  Yes, you can call and say you're with.  You can say you're with a social worker.  They force me to call you.  I'm with a social worker now.  And you know what?  And then you play therapist.  We just need, is there a hatred?  Because if we take the approach, if we understand. 
[02:40:30]  Right, we understand.  We understand this is, this is, this is, this is total normal.  That's the way to do it.  Let's get her on the phone.  Should we take a break?  Should we take a break?  No, because if we take a break, they're going to fucking blow up our bit.  Yeah, listen.  Yeah, you do it right now.  I've been at this a long fucking time.  He's a social worker.  I don't know if I can pull it off.  I'll be honest.  I think, I think.  Anthony's a therapist.  No, I think if, I think.  I think Anthony can pull it off.  I'd be the social worker. 
[02:41:00]  And it takes the lead.  I could, I could jump in a little bit.  I'll be the social worker.  And I, I certainly can write notes from past experience down.  But you can be a therapist, can't you, from your life?  Yeah, all right.  Well, let's, let's just do it.  You don't have to ask as much as a social worker.  Yeah, let's just do it.  All right.  Let's go.  Did I give him the number?  Yeah, I think so, right?  Oh, he's nervous.  And I'm like, I'm putting on my headphones for this one.  Nervous.  And I'm going to have to be emotionally ready because I can't get emotionally involved when  she starts to deny, I don't know.  Just denying.  The voice of her going, I don't know what you're talking about. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I do.  It was the, it was like the Kathy Bates thing in that movie.  It was the most eerie feeling down my spine.  But at the same time, like, this is my mother.  Jesus Christ.  I have greater things to talk about today.  Nicer things.  I was in Amsterdam.  You guys are huge in Amsterdam.  We'll talk about it.  Yeah, we're huge all over the world.  It's all over the world.  It's apparent at this point.  It's weird to have a guy in Amsterdam going, oh my God, Pizza Man and Lars Ulrich.  She's not answering? 
[02:42:00]  We haven't called her yet because I didn't want to leave her on hold while we were discussing.  By the way, this is a perfect opportunity to tell Mr. Brewer that he just sold his documentary  more than me.  Oh, hell yeah.  Because now everybody wants to see your father.  Yeah.  You know what?  And now-  I'm telling you, you just sold the movie-  This is like genius timing.  Indirectly.  Yeah, yeah.  This is almost genius timing that this freaking documentary-  I saw more than me yesterday and it fucking almost brought me to tears and I missed my  fucking father like you wouldn't believe. 
[02:42:30]  And basically this movie, really fast, is Mr. Brewer, Jim Brewer going on the road with  his dad because he knew his dad needed a fucking break.  You would love this, Rich.  Yeah.  Why?  Because he's your, like, he'll make you laugh hard.  Oh, I saw the documentary.  Oh, you're right.  You're right.  You're in body parts.  Oh, we saw the-  You saw it before it even was final.  Okay, hold on.  But there's tons of laughs in this thing.  Yeah.  It's really dark at times and very serious, but it's really funny as well.  Oh, yeah.  And basically Brewer, who's a rock star when he's on the road, drags his 85-year-old at 
[02:43:00]  the time, father around with him for 30 days on the road, going in and out of these shitty  hotels.  Yeah, that's what I didn't get to, hotels.  Some of them, right?  You're doing well.  What's wrong with you, Brewer?  I was thinking that too.  That was my sister.  Days in.  Booking me these things.  There was a days in.  These are upscale places for me, but for him.  But it was really fucking good.  Yeah, it was a good documentary.  Really moving.  Very moving, very funny.  And now after this hour, Brewer telling these stories, everyone's going to want to see what 
[02:43:30]  his father's all about.  So it's perfect.  It's perfect.  It is.  Now, it just hit me.  That is freaking genius timing.  And now I'm blessed that this happened.  Jimbrewer.com.  Pre-order the DVD, More Than Me, and it's Brewer, B-R-E-U-E-R.com.  Well, you know, it's kind of...  Jimbrewer.com.  I'm not being...  It's kind of selfish that your mom is beating your dad and you're blessed over it.  You know, because of my dad's beating, I'm going to profit.  Lemon's lemonade, Rich. 
[02:44:00]  Lemon's lemonade.  I'm actually going to use all the money and I'm only going to stop taking...  Because I originally offered to pay for her rent.  Yeah.  Now I really don't want to pay for her rent.  So whatever I make off this, she'll have to pay for it and then I'll pay for my dad's  aides.  Yeah.  Through the film.  Well, can't she get...  Doesn't she get Medicare?  No.  You know what?  She's not capable of it yet.  Call up.  You have to be...  Do you want it to go straight to you, not the phone screener?  So you'll hear the radio. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I think it should go straight to...  Straight to you guys.  But who says hello?  I say hello?  Yeah, yeah.  You got to say hello and...  I'm with a social worker and a therapist.  Well, you know what?  You also got to let her know she's on the air.  Yeah, you could say I'm on the air with a social worker.  Like, there's a social worker in here?  Do we have to say we're on the air?  No, let's just slide one through for once.  Are they going to fire us?  They would do me a favor at this point.  Let's do this.  No, just say...  Just fucking do this.  Let's do this.  Then I should have been fired a long time ago because I do it on an everyday basis on 
[02:45:00]  my show.  And Howard has prank calls all the time.  Stop already.  Just say we're on the air, me.  Like she says, can you...  Yeah, maybe just slide it in.  Yeah, that's fair enough.  Just sort of you're on the air, by the way.  I'll just say I'm on the air.  Yeah.  But I think you got to start where it's just you.  Yeah.  And then when she's not fessing up, then we go with the social worker.  You could even slide it in like, yeah, hey, I'm on...  Hey, I'm over here.  You're on air with a social worker. 
[02:45:30]  You're on air.  I'm here with a social worker.  Yeah, you're on air.  Well, I'm here.  You know what?  I'll make it sound like I'm pooping up.  You're right.  Yeah.  Okay.  You guys worried?  All right, it's fair enough.  All right, let's go.  We'll get this done.  You ready to do it?  She can't be here anyway, so...  You're right?  No, I wouldn't give a shit about the company.  Just...  It's another issue.  Just stammer through the...  Yeah, as long as you, you know, just say it. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  All right, we're putting her...  We're calling her now.  And it's going to...  And we should hear the ringy-dangies.  You're going to hear the ring.  Okay, very good.  Deep breath.  Deep breath.  Will she wait?  Will she give the answer?  She should.  All right.  Because she's going to think it's my sister in Florida, which she's still...  With the burn mark?  She has no...  Well, my sister might be there.  Oh, but you have to click the phone immediately when it's on hold, and then you'll hear the ringy-dangies.  I don't have to do shit.  What's a...  What's a social worker's name speaking?  You pick one.  Art Vandalay.  What is your name? 
[02:46:30]  Charlie?  Charles.  Charles.  Charles.  And it will be Bill Tetley.  I'm...  Bill Tetley.  William.  William.  William Tetley.  William Tetley.  But don't...  You're...  It's just...  Right, right.  I'm just here.  We get nowhere, then we ramp it up to the second one.  Oh, don't worry about it.  Yep.  No answer?  Son of a bitch.  What happened?  She's not answering?  I don't know.  We're dialing right now.  Okay.  I don't hear it.  I don't hear it.  Okay, pick it up.  Go.  Hello? 
[02:47:00]  Ah, okay.  We got rings.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Hey, if you call your mom, I'll call my mom.  Hello?  Hello?  Mom.  Mom?  Yeah?  Hey, Monday hour.  Listen.  Um...  We gotta seriously talk about...  Listen.  We have to really be dead serious and talk about what's been going on. 
[02:47:30]  I know.  Okay.  Now I have to help you also.  I got a hold of a therapist and a social worker that I have here with me.  Hello, Mrs. Brewer.  This is William Tetley.  Hello.  Hello.  How are you?  Okay.  All right.  Now, they both...  I just need to hear...  Listen.  I don't want you to deny what has been done. 
[02:48:00]  Uh...  I don't buy that you don't understand what you did to Dad.  I don't know what I did to him.  You put your hands on him.  I do that all the time.  No, you hit him.  Well, maybe he was irritating really bad and I slapped him.  I might have.  Yes, I might have.  Okay, so yesterday when I asked you if you did this, you lied to me and you said I did not hit him. 
[02:48:30]  No, I don't remember doing it, Jimmy.  I don't remember doing it.  Oh, Mom, you're as clear as day.  I do not buy that.  You're clearly lying.  You are clearly lying.  No, I'm not.  And you need to face what you're doing.  Yesterday you told me I may have shook him.  Now you just told me I may have slapped his face.  I don't know.  Oh, no, I didn't slap his face. 
[02:49:00]  You'd slap his head?  You'd pull his ears?  I don't.  This is written down in reports.  I may have pulled his ears fooling around, but I never pulled his ears.  That's not.  You and I, when he's screaming to say stop,  there's reports that you would put down the water and throw it in.  You'd dip your hands yesterday, poke in the back of his head. 
[02:49:30]  What?  Why?  This is what I want to ask you.  What is it that drives you to do that?  I, let's say he was annoying you.  How is he annoying you laying in a bed?  I don't know.  What makes you enter the bedroom and attack him while someone is being paid to take care  of him, and all you have to do is stay out of his room?  You, what was your purpose entering that room? 
[02:50:00]  I don't remember.  You do remember, and you're going to tell me.  I don't.  So you just wandered aimlessly and said, oh, I'm in the bedroom now.  No, he must have said something.  He must have said something, or he did say something.  I don't know.  So why would you, you have to remember, you have never had a memory loss in your life.  I know that for a fact.  You know that for a fact.  You are not Alzheimer's, and you do not have dementia. 
[02:50:30]  You are clear as day, so I need you to explain to me and the social worker and the therapist  who are also reading the reports, I'm trying to help you here so this doesn't get uglier.  And what I need to know is to hear you, and you're not getting in trouble.  I need you to vent.  What made you go in the room?  What was your initial purpose?  He might have been yelling at the girl. 
[02:51:00]  The girls were not there yet.  Well, then he was yelling for me to come in, and I can't get him up.  But you know you can't get him up, and you've been saying this for a year already, and thus,  matter of fact, the bed, you can't get him up, and the bed is made so he can't even get  out of bed, no matter who's there, unless an aide is there.  You know that, and I know that.  So please, again, explain to me why you would go in the room.  If he has to, because I have to see what he wants, Jimmy. 
[02:51:30]  Okay, what did he want?  I don't remember.  He probably wanted to pee.  He probably wanted to pee?  So you just, you remember going in the room, and you think maybe he wanted to pee?  And I get the urinal for him, if that's what it was.  Okay.  I can't get his thing in the urinal, and he can't get it in the urinal.  Okay.  So that frustrated you, I guess.  That's frustrating. 
[02:52:00]  Yes?  And again, it goes all over.  But then why would you hit him?  I don't know why I hit him.  But you do hit him, Mrs. Brewer.  Once in a while, if he gets an issue with me.  Do you think that's right, to hit a man that's bedridden, Mrs. Brewer?  No, it's not right.  But sometimes it gets you, you can't, you just can't control your emotions anymore.  I think you have some deep-seated anger issues. 
[02:52:30]  I've read the reports, by the way.  And there is definite bruising and signs of physical abuse to this man.  And this has to stop.  Where do you think this comes from in your past?  I've talked to Jim about your past and different men.  Is there a hatred towards men in general that you're harboring?  No.  No? 
[02:53:00]  Could it be just that?  Is it the money?  That you feel that he's, you know, the aides are causing anguish from your bank account, maybe?  I'm worried about it, yeah.  But does that cause, because where I'm confused, Mom, is you seem to be happy in the place that you're going to be going.  And I need to hear an honest opinion from you if you've been not telling me the truth. 
[02:53:30]  Because what I got from you is, this is a great thing and I can't wait to do this.  And I thought we were all in a great place.  And is that true so far?  Yeah.  Okay.  So here you are going, okay, I'm going to go away.  My son is going to pay for it, besides the two mortgages he has and everything else he does, living on the road and all that.  And he's going to put and take care of his mother here and his father. 
[02:54:00]  No, I'm taking care of your father.  Well, you're taking care, actually, Dad's taking care of from the pension he makes.  The pension don't cover it, Jim.  It covers three quarters of it.  Yeah, just about.  Right.  But wouldn't you fairly say, for the years of him being home, taking care of your children, such as Patty and myself, and never hitting you and never abusing you like some of the abuse you had in the past, that maybe this man might be worth some of that? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yes.  I think he's worth it.  You sure?  But don't forget, I took care of my children, too.  I worked every day.  So did he.  Three jobs, I remember.  No one's denying that.  I remember my father being a sanitation, janitor, and bartender, all at the same time.  Right?  Yeah.  So I remember both of you working.  I remember that.  Clears a day. 
[02:55:00]  Mrs. Brewer?  Yes.  I read in one of the reports that you were smacking your husband's ears.  This is very strange to me.  He got up one morning and said he couldn't hear.  I didn't know if he was fooling or if he meant it.  Now, a gentleman of his advanced years, wouldn't you assume that he meant it and this wasn't a joke?  And then to take the palms of your hands and smash them into his ears does not seem like a thing to do that would be healthy for this gentleman. 
[02:55:30]  Well, he kept laughing at it, and we thought he was fooling.  From what I've heard and read in the reports, he did not find this funny.  Well, I don't know.  Mom?  Yeah?  I need to know where your violent streak comes from because you clearly got worse the minute you got your place. 
[02:56:00]  And it seems to come out of almost like a childlike, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And I just, everyone here is baffled, and I didn't think we'd be in this situation where I have to tell people she's 85.  And I now have places concerned about you going there to live, afraid you'll lash out to a neighbor or someone else. 
[02:56:30]  Because if you're, if you are capable of doing what you've done, which you clearly won't admit is wrong, and you clearly will not even apologize for it, but rather just try to find reasoning for it, then there is a major issue.  I don't think it's healthy for you to even see him right now, because I don't believe, I won't believe your apology because it's more to just clear your air. 
[02:57:00]  It's not a true apology.  It's just to say, hey, I'm cool, and this is where we're at right now.  I don't, we need to find out.  If, if at the end of the day you said, you know what, I'm not going to lie to you, Jim, I hate your father, or I'm not going to lie to you, I hate him for what, I can understand to somewhat degree. 
[02:57:30]  I don't hate him.  I don't understand where the violence comes from.  You clearly go out of the way to attack him at times.  Right, there's absolute violence, and from what I'm hearing here, it's excuses and, oh, it was a joke, and it was this.  You're not taking responsibility for the fact that you're physically abusing a bedridden, wheelchair-bound man.  Where does that come from?  I don't know.  But you do assume it comes from somewhere.  It must come from somewhere. 
[02:58:00]  Well, you have to have some idea of where it might come from.  Can you reach back, perhaps?  No, I can't.  And really think, when did this start?  How long ago?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  It's a lot I don't remember.  You don't remember yesterday, but then you do remember.  You don't remember hitting him, but then you do remember hitting him.  You need to talk, Mom.  I don't know what to say.  Well, you're going to have to really think about what you've done, because there's a lot of eyes on you right now, and it's not healthy right now, and you have no clue the circumstance that you put everyone in. 
[02:58:30]  It's very uncomfortable for everybody.  I realize that.  I'm uncomfortable, too.  You're uncomfortable.  Jim's not going to let you see your husband, is what he's saying.  I can't.  He's petrified. 
[02:59:00]  The thought of you petrifies him.  He wasn't petrified when he left yesterday.  Oh, when he got to the house, he would not eat, and he kept saying, is she coming here?  Is she coming here?  Do I have to go back?  The reports that were made by not one, but three different aides that came there are, quite frankly,  I, my spine is chilled, Mom, that, I, I'm chilled. 
[02:59:30]  I'm really chilled, and I, I don't even know, I'm beside myself.  I really don't, I, I love you, you're my mother, but I, I don't know if I even know you, right?  I'm very disturbed.  Well, I am, too, because she's petrified.  Yeah, but you did it, so how, that, that is, I can say, I hit my daughter.  Why'd I hit my daughter?  Well, she, I, I asked her to do this, she was disrespectful, she, I asked her not to, 
[03:00:00]  and she repeated, and then she lashed out, and she hit, so I spanked her on the butt.  I, I, and then I go, the emotions got the best of me, but you clearly go out of your way to go after him at times.  It's just vindictive, it sounds like, yeah.  So, now let me ask you this.  Um, one of the reports said they're pretty confident that, probably yesterday, there's 
[03:00:30]  no way he could have peed the amount of water that was in the bed, and they really think  you might have just thrown water, did you, oh, I did not, that's ridiculous.  I'm just asking, I'm just asking.  Now, hasn't there been episodes in the past where she has thrown water at, uh, your father?  No, the reports were she would dip her hands in the water, and then, in a, in a, uh, you know, 
[03:01:00]  condescending way, and then spritz it in his face.  Would this happen, Mrs. Brown?  I don't remember doing that, either.  You don't remember a lot, I've noticed.  She doesn't remember a lot of things.  You know, we, we, but, and you say there's no Alzheimer's or dementia?  No, none whatsoever.  She's clear as day.  So, how come you don't remember so much when, when, when these episodes are going on where  you're clearly abusing your, your husband?  I don't know.  No, but I definitely didn't throw water in the bed, because I was the one that said  to him, my God, this place is soaking wet. 
[03:01:30]  Okay.  Now, would that be crazy to think that you may have done something like that, when, in  fact, we've heard stories of, why would I do that?  Well, we, why would you, why would you hit him?  Why would you, why would you pull his ears, why would you poke him, why would you do anything?  To the point where they're bruised.  I mean, there's physical evidence of abuse here.  I don't know.  I mean, we could, we, we just want to, we just want to understand.  So do I.  We just want to understand where this is coming from, why there's so much, uh, uh, hatred, 
[03:02:00]  uh, it seems, inside you.  I don't know.  You have to know.  You have to.  I don't.  You have no clue.  No.  Is there a resentment that you have to your husband that...  No.  No.  There has to be a little mom, which is okay and understandable.  I don't think so.  Do you feel angry because you think he's leaving you behind? 
[03:02:30]  Because he went to Jimmy's?  Yes.  No.  Or he might, or he might be moving on and you feel that you're going to be left alone and  there's anger towards that?  Uh, no, because I know I won't be here that long to be left alone.  That he's following me on Twitter and you're not...  I can't hear you.  Nothing.  Yeah, I, I don't understand.  So, um, I guess we'll...  That was Dr. Van Nostrom.  He's a, uh, the, uh, therapist. 
[03:03:00]  Yes.  All right.  Well, I would just think about things.  Um, I don't even know where to, I don't even know where to go because you, like I said,  you clearly will not take action.  You will not take responsibility what you clearly know you did.  And, and you're pretending like you don't know and you're innocent and you don't know  what's going on.  You know what's going on.  You know what's going on. 
[03:03:30]  How, how hard do you hit him?  Not that, if I hit him, not that hard.  How, not that strong.  But it does, it feels good though inside, doesn't it?  Huh?  It feels good inside though.  No, not really.  Takes a little of that stress away.  Maybe it's a stress release.  Maybe it's that.  I don't know.  I mean, when you hit someone, it just feels good.  You know it's wrong, but it just feels good. 
[03:04:00]  Are we onto something?  Huh?  Are we onto something?  No, I, I just, I mean, you're, you're, I'm confused.  I've been, uh, studying this for 40 years and, and, you know, you're in a tough spot,  obviously.  It can't be easy to have an elderly husband that you have to take care of.  And I'm an elderly woman, but you're, you're more with it when, than, uh, your husband is  certainly.  And it must just feel, it's just a relief to maybe, uh, lash out. 
[03:04:30]  I, I think we could agree with that, right?  Yes.  So how hard do you hit him?  How hard?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not hard.  Do you try to hold back or, or you give a, you know, you give it, uh, a hundred percent?  No, never a hundred percent.  I'm not that strong.  Seventy, eighty percent?  Maybe fifty percent, if anything.  Yeah, I understand.  Uh, we've seen this before.  It's not easy, though, right? 
[03:05:00]  To take care of him.  No, it's not easy, but I do it.  And sometimes you just gotta lash out.  Yeah, I know.  Because you don't, because you don't know what else to do, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm, so that's where it comes from, you think?  I guess so, yeah.  Okay.  Do you think he deserves that?  No. 
[03:05:30]  And you're, you, you think of yourself as a rational human being, right?  Not completely at times.  Well, obviously at those times, that's not rational behavior.  No, it's not.  Why do you continue doing it?  I don't know.  We need, we need answers here.  Well, we've learned.  We don't want to, we don't want to take this to the next step.  We've learned it's a relief.  It's a, it's a stress relief.  It's a stress relief.  But this is what I also told you, Mom.  Do you remember, in the, and I know you remember this. 
[03:06:00]  I looked at you and I said, Mom, when you're frustrated, when you're mad,  when you want to lash out, call me any time of the day.  And this was just a couple days ago.  And you said, okay, you know, what do you mean?  I went, you know what I mean.  Yeah, but I can't call you any time of the day.  No, see, but the, what I'm trying to explain to you is, you have openings and you have offers 
[03:06:30]  to approach these emotions you have before you lash out.  I gotcha.  You have other things to do to lash out.  And when you can't control yourself from lashing out, whether it's pulling his ears,  whether it's screaming at him, whether it's shoving his head, whether it's poking his head, 
[03:07:00]  where it's giving him a smack, no matter what it is, you have to find another means of venting  that frustration.  I gotcha.  Have you ever punched him in the balls?  I have a, why?  Hit him in the balls, I don't think.  No.  But that, you've seen that before, Doc?  Oh, yes, I have.  Okay.  Do you feel like he doesn't appreciate you?  Everything you do for him?  No, I just think he doesn't know where he is. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Can't be easy.  We understand that the, it can't be easy part, certainly.  We've seen this.  But you can't hit him 50%.  He's an old, he's an old man.  I realize that.  88 years old.  Let me ask you this.  What do you think is the best way to resolve everything right now? 
[03:08:00]  I don't know.  Maybe keep him over there and I'll go visit him.  I'm talking, go ahead.  What do you say, doctor?  That's not going to happen anytime soon.  There's too much denial here.  All right.  We're hearing way too much denial.  A lot of denial.  That's what I'm saying.  We really need to get everything out on the table, exactly what has been going on the last  few years.  And then we could get past this.  You're talking to a bunch of people here that understand the situation.  But until you put it all on the table, we can't move forward with this.  We cannot allow you to visit him anytime soon. 
[03:08:30]  So what I'm saying is, I'll give you some time.  But just like, just like, I'm not saying you are, just like a criminal that gets caught  stealing something, we'll take someone in our family, okay?  Then we all know who, I don't have to go into names.  And there was a time where the car was taken, they were in your house, and everyone denied 
[03:09:00]  everything.  Do you remember that feeling of the denial?  Yes.  And how frustrating, and we all knew, and not only did that person deny it, and they  were a different person back then, we all know that, but even the family members of that  person was like, I don't know what you did, they went on attack mode.  It's the, until that person finally said, wow, I can't believe what I did.  And they really meant it, and really acknowledged why they did it, is when that human being moved 
[03:09:30]  on in life.  You have to find that, because you still have not accepted, or you have not acknowledged  what you've done, or what you do.  Well, Jim, let's try to find out what she's willing to admit.  Dr. Vandele, you might as well continue. 
[03:10:00]  What are you willing to admit today?  You said you've hit him numerous times at 50%.  I'm assuming if you're admitting to 50%, it's probably more like 60 to 75% of your full  strength.  What else are you willing to admit today?  I admit that he frustrates me sometimes.  Have you thrown water on him?  Not the flicking, but full cups of water, maybe a pot of water?  No.  Okay.  Okay.  That's ridiculous.  Have you slapped his ears quite hard to the point where he may have yelled at? 
[03:10:30]  I did when he said he couldn't hear, and he kept fooling around, and we didn't know if  he could or he couldn't.  How hard have you pulled his ears?  Not that hard.  Well, reports say differently.  Yeah, we're not going to get anything accomplished here.  No, we're still in denial about the whole thing.  And from what I hear, we've been briefed, and from what we hear, there is a history that  could date back to some of your children's history. 
[03:11:00]  A lot of questions are being asked about certain people, siblings of Jim's, and what has happened  to them in the past, perhaps abuse, things like this, such.  You know what I'm getting at?  No, I don't know.  You've been confronted in the past with maybe scarring? 
[03:11:30]  Maybe what?  I thought maybe you'd be able to tell me.  How about abusing, abuse of the children?  Are you around to watch the children being beaten as they were growing up?  I never beat my children.  I never beat them.  I'm not saying you, personally.  I'm just saying, have you seen the children being beaten by men that you have brought home?  Yes, I have.  And you stood by and did what?  No, I didn't sit by.  I attacked.  She did attack.  Oh, yeah?  I can preach more of that stuff. 
[03:12:00]  Okay.  Let me write that in my report.  Hold on.  I want to put a check mark there.  Why don't we do this?  Just think about where a lot of this comes from.  Thank you.  And I want you to really think about, because between you and me, Ma, you know, now places  want to know if you're, they just want to know if you're a potential threat around other 
[03:12:30]  people.  And I try to explain you won't be, but we have, it's reports now.  So I'm just telling you, you need to come to a point, and you need to acknowledge, and  you need to vent.  You know, you were talking to that pastor for a while, and you were letting a lot out.  Maybe you lost some of that.  I don't know.  I remember you were at a different place, but you need to find something, Ma.  I don't know what, I don't know if you pray, I don't know what, you, whatever it is, you 
[03:13:00]  need to find it.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  We'll talk to you soon.  Do you concur, Dr. A.G.  Pennypacker?  Sure.  Why not?  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chris.  Thank you, Mom.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Bye.  Whoa.  Dude, I was, you scared me.  I didn't want to.  I'm really uncomfortable.  Now, here's what's funny.  No, I didn't want to go anywhere with that.  Well, no, there's heavy, heavy stories.  We didn't know how.  And the book, when she passed away, that book will be written. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, really?  And it's heavy, and it's dark, but the past, she left one night, gathered up the  kids after her, it's such a long story.  She lived in freaking Brazil with this rich guy from Pan Am.  Holy shit.  Had a maid, but at the same time, the guy would come home, beat her, get into the kids, his  own kids.  And then one night, as my brother describes, taking a gun and shooting, trying to kill 
[03:14:00]  her, out in the street, running around the car, they would hide at night with knives,  waiting for him to come home, trying to kill him, while he was sleeping.  And then, fucking crazy shit.  Oh, dude, you have no clue.  I asked my sister one time, what was the...  You know what?  You're just kind of like, hey, man, what's the best time you ever had in your life?  And my sister, the one with the scar, said, the night we ran away from home, and we got 
[03:14:30]  a hotel somewhere in North Carolina, that was the best sleep I ever had in my life.  Just one night of being able to just not worry.  And I, and I, I'm so naive of this, because I never got any of this.  I would hear my dad badge, I would, I would hear my mom go like, you're so stupid, and  your kids ain't getting my goddamn money, and don't think, so I would watch that, and  I had some anger towards any chick that would, like, attempt to talk me down. 
[03:15:00]  They were immediately out of the relationship, because I'd see my mom coming out, so...  Well, your kid, your dad's, your dad's kids, too, and...  My dad has kids from his first, his first marriage, and, you know, he was a heavy drinker  when he was younger, and he just came out, they came out of World War II, and they're  like, here's some, go start some, you know...  Yeah, yeah, get a family going.  Go get a family, baby, and you spread your seed.  You gotta get the population back from the guys that died in the war.  Yeah, and sort of like the Iraqi and Afghanistan, no one's acknowledging them when they 
[03:15:30]  come home, I mean, Jimmy will tell you, Norton, when we went to the Pentagon, I'm still shaking  up from that day, that these kids, kids with no legs and no arms, and they're sucking in  a tube, and here's the wife, who has three kids, and she's starting to get resentful,  and, you know, what'd they get from the government?  Hey, listen, thank you.  Um, so, let's go to Britney Spears, and, damn, what's going on with Tom Cruise?  Hey, uh, Eddie Murphy is... 
[03:16:00]  No one gives a shit.  No one gives a shit.  So, you know, of course they're gonna drink heavy, or of course they're gonna start doing  drugs, or kill themselves, or whatever.  But, um, so, yeah, he probably drank the shit out of himself.  And so, his second marriage was my mom, which I truly think she trapped him, because she  was in the middle of whatever, because they never got married, it was a full-blown accident, 
[03:16:30]  and my mom was in between him and another guy, which my side explains, and then my stepbrows,  and then, see, when she said she never hit her kids before, she never hit me.  But my brother will clearly say, to this day, he goes, when I was 16, she smacked me for  the last time.  For the last time.  And I grabbed her arms, and I said, you will never touch me again. 
[03:17:00]  And then, as soon as he was 17, he took off and never came back home.  Wow.  He went to the mountains.  He didn't even have electricity.  He just left.  So, I don't know, I'm waiting, it's gonna be a great movie.  Great book, but it's just, it's wild, man.  Do you see that?  Did you hear the...  You put us in a bad position, because I didn't know how far we could take it.  So, I went with the ball.  I got scared.  No, you were great.  And then, it's going with the scar thing.  I had great therapy, and Anthony wanted to get that one, but I knew... 
[03:17:30]  We were holding back, man, because I don't know.  I didn't know where she'd go with the scar.  But I knew the miss, she denied going, I never hit my kids.  And I went, alright, she ain't going nowhere.  She ain't going nowhere.  Let's just end this now.  Dude, isn't that crazy?  That's fucking...  Wow.  Yeah, the whole, like, just...  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I don't know.  That's an easy way out of shit.  In my own life, I've heard that a million fucking times.  Like, just fucking admit some shit.  Instead of this, I don't remember, I didn't do this. 
[03:18:00]  We all know what you did.  That is very odd.  And the whole, like, I don't...  That's psychotic, no offense.  Yeah, it's psychotic.  It's...  Is she on meds?  I don't remember.  She does do meds, but it's...  I'm telling you, I've seen her.  It has nothing to do with meds.  It's just, she has this deep...  We were joking.  That whole thing was...  We were joking.  I was joking cracking him in the ear.  He thought it was funny.  Cracking him in the ear.  It's weird. 
[03:18:30]  I don't know how to relate.  What do you think?  Do you think she's so frustrated that she gets a little frustration out?  You nailed it, doctor!  I think she's living in fear.  Fear?  Of what, though?  Fear of abandonment and being alone when he passes away.  Yeah, you could be right.  Yeah.  Well, you know what, Rich?  She...  I know she definitely...  Yeah, she definitely has that deep, deep fear because she often will say...  She keeps bringing up money.  You're right. 
[03:19:00]  No, he's right, though.  Dude, why?  I'm sorry, because you've got to keep it funny.  Why?  You've got to keep the funny, yeah.  Cigars at Scotch-Rights.  What is it?  Baby Jim's parents discovered S&M late in life, and your father forgot the safe word.  Or you stumbled upon it.  They've been doing this their whole lives.  That's brutal.  Sorry.  He might have been right.  He might be right.  He's like, God damn it, what's the safe word?  Oh, shit. 
[03:19:30]  You forgot?  But no, Rich, you're right.  She lives in fear of him dying and all that.  But the whole...  Does she still love him?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I get...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Like, the beating is a fear.  I don't know.  Where's the beating and the hitting come from?  And the screaming.  It is fear.  Don't leave me.  Stop.  Don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  That's what you see.  Stephen Texas has a good one, too. 
[03:20:00]  I don't know.  I'm not a doctor.  No, no, no.  But you're right.  I think Rich is right.  You know, please.  It's like when you're...  Please don't...  You're pounding so much heart to keep him going.  Keep him going.  Don't leave me, you son of a bitch.  Don't leave me.  Don't leave me here with all this.  Stephen Texas.  Don't have time to go to him.  He says, she absolutely remembers when she didn't do something.  This is where something's going on.  Yet doesn't remember doing things.  So what does that mean?  Well, if you call her out on something, she goes, I absolutely didn't do that. 
[03:20:30]  And then you call...  Right.  And then she'll go, I don't remember.  Right.  I don't remember, Jimmy.  I don't remember.  It's like when I would ask Norma...  I used to know when Norma lied, because he'd go, eh.  So she kept going, come on, did you hit him?  Eh.  What's that?  I heard I hit him.  I don't remember that.  I don't remember that.  So yeah, that's when I thought it was amazing.  And she'd go, absolutely.  That's ridiculous.  There's no way.  Where everything else was...  I don't remember. 
[03:21:00]  I don't remember, Jimmy.  It's a typical...  That's creepy.  That's Kathy Bates shit.  I don't remember.  Yeah, yeah, right?  It's the typical criminal.  Where were you that night?  I remember.  Yeah, but you're also talking to an 85-year-old lady.  It's different when you go, when a 45 or a 40-year-old man goes, I don't remember.  An 85-year-old lady has a lot...  She's got so much shit going through her fucking head right now.  No, you're right.  Rich is actually making me feel better.  But if there was so many instances...  She's got, you know, going into a home, losing her house, her husband's going to pass away.  Right.  There's a lot of shit going through her head at 85 where there's things that she cannot remember. 
[03:21:30]  Rich is talking from experience.  I'm telling you.  She remembers.  No, I believe you as far as the fear.  Plus his old joke.  And she's petrified.  And that could block out some of her memory.  I don't believe it blocks out.  I'm not saying attacking's right, but there is stuff that's going to escape her.  But the other side of this...  How many things do you forget in life?  I don't forget the traumatic...  I don't remember every person I punched and kicked clearly hard. 
[03:22:00]  I get what you're saying.  I get what you're saying.  Here's what I'll buy.  I buy the...  It comes from the fear...  I think you nailed it with the don't leave me, don't leave me, god damn it, don't leave me.  Because this brings up an interesting point.  Her first love, she got married, pregnant, he was shipped to World War II, and killed two months before the war ended. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, fuck.  So then, her father, her anchor in life, died a year and change later.  And then her grandfather, two years after that.  And then, the only thing that kept her to her childhood memory and the ex-husband that died, that still to this day is her love of life, was my oldest brother, who died a little over ten years ago. 
[03:23:00]  And that just destroyed her.  Everything she's loved.  Everything she has loved.  Abandonment.  The real love.  Anything she has truly loved was ripped away from her.  So...  Yeah, there's some abandonment stuff going on there.  Wow.  I think it's from abandonment.  Wow.  Wow, let's call her again.  I'm kidding.  But no, but you helped me be able to talk to her and be like, listen, I get the abandonment and we're here for you. 
[03:23:30]  Now can you help me get back in the improvs?  Voss, you ass.  No, thank you, Voss.  That was awesome.  Your Twitter comment was really good, too, Rich.  Very good.  The Twitter thing.  Jesus Christ.  I said this Twitter.  Enough with the Twitter.  Does my mother have blackouts?  No.  Yeah, why doesn't Jim get a nanny cam?  Well, it's over now.  Yeah.  Because he's in my house.  You should have teddy bears all over that fucking place.  Oh, God.  Oh, I should.  I should.  Teddy bears with those fucking cameras.  When they say uncomfortable, Opie and Anthony radio, this is probably the most uncomfortable I've ever fucking been. 
[03:24:00]  Seriously, right?  Well, because it's too real.  It's very real.  Everybody brings me back to my fucking horrible life.  His horrible life.  Okay.  You know, his fucking father.  Yeah, but everyone can relate to it, man.  Yeah, but everyone can relate to it.  Making him shower together with his brother.  And you realize you're not alone.  You don't have fucking shit going on.  Right.  You're not alone.  You realize you're not alone.  It's good to get real.  Once in a while, it's good to get a little real.  I like it.  Good times.  Good times.  Yeah, well.  I love the S&M joke. 
[03:24:30]  That was funny.  Oh, my God.  That is really funny.  Safe word.  I would imagine a lot of people are going to now pre-order Jim Brewer's more than me,  because now you can see his father.  Yes.  As Brewer takes him on the road for 30 days.  And I will say.  We saw the documentary.  It's fucking.  I will say I was very flattered by Rich, because you know Rich, he trashes everything,  tax everything.  And when you wrote back to me, you and Bonnie saw it, and you went, I love the documentary.  I immediately went, okay. 
[03:25:00]  Where is it?  It was the first time I saw him dead serious.  He's like, no, I'm being dead serious.  Yeah, we took.  It was not freaking believable.  Not only did we like it, the guy that did his sound levels were using to do ours.  That's how good.  Oh, you're in good hands.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy's amazing.  It's a good.  And we always saw.  He revived it since we saw it.  Right.  So it's better than when we saw it.  Right.  Okay.  And I don't have to plug this jackass.  He doesn't return my calls.  I'm having dinner.  Go fuck yourself. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  I get nothing out of plugging this fucking.  All right.  Wow.  Do I could just walk onto his tour bus?  Go fuck yourself.  But it's good.  It's really good.  Another side of Brewer, man.  Oh, it's good.  Hey, listen.  It's good.  It's real.  You took a risk with this.  I did.  I did.  But I.  But the laughs are absolutely there.  The laughs.  He steals the show.  Yeah.  He's so freaking funny in it.  Yeah.  The guy's an animal.  Oh, he's a beast.  Did you have to pay for the Johnny Cash music? 
[03:26:00]  No.  Oh, maybe I should bring that up.  No, no, no.  Here's the loophole.  Here's the loophole in the Johnny Cash.  I was really curious about that.  Here's the loophole.  Because there's motherfuckers now with music and movies.  Listen.  The money.  This is why we had to score the whole freaking movie.  Because we couldn't get the right.  I want 8,000.  I want 10,000.  I want 12,000.  So I'm like, gee, this movie's going to cost a fortune for 30 seconds of music.  The Johnny Cash part.  There's a loophole when you make a documentary movie.  If you're not going out of your way to put that on, like if it's playing on the radio or television, and it just finds itself in the scene, and it's not purposely written in and all that, which clearly when you watch it, you're like, this just happened. 
[03:26:30]  Well, can I take you inside the process?  You and your dad probably sat around for eight hours waiting for the radio station to play the proper song.  And then it starts, and you go, all right, action.  We got it.  And go.  So don't fuck this take up. 
[03:27:00]  We're going to have to wait another eight hours.  Jim's hitting his ears.  There's a lot of fucking, bro, leave your dad alone.  There's a lot of talented people out there.  We could never afford a song.  We want Isn't She Lovely by Stevie Wonder.  So if any O&A fans who are, there's some talented fucking O&A fans, if you can come write a song close to Isn't She Lovely without us getting sued.  A sideways version of it.  Like, Isn't She Kinda Pretty. 
[03:27:30]  Well, you beat up all the listeners, so they're not going to help you out now.  What do you think a Stevie Wonder song like that would cost?  Isn't She Lovely.  You can't even touch it.  Nah, you ain't touching that.  So, Brewer, the music in your film is all original?  Yes.  Holy shit.  It's the guy doing Rich and Bonnie's film, and that cost a couple grand, but, you know,  a couple grand compared to 20, 30, 40, 60 grand.  Yeah.  Try to put out a price.  Like, I'm not going to make money off this.  No, we're not using, you know.  The music, we're using your sound leveler guy. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, the leveler.  The leveler.  He's fucking brilliant.  I know he is.  He's fucking.  I know.  All right.  He's brilliant.  I know.  No one cares, Rich.  Yes, he does.  I'm talking about Brewer's movie.  You care and Jim cares, but, like, the guy from fucking Philly right now doesn't care.  That's not Hillary Clinton, is it?  Look how bad she looks.  She grew her hair out.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know who looks good?  Jane Fonda.  She's got my hairstyle from AF, man.  She's got my brother man, brother man hair, dude. 
[03:28:30]  Yes.  That's how I used to look.  Have you seen...  What?  Nothing.  Jane Fonda, 73.  She looks fucking smoking.  Good for you.  She's a fucking communist.  I don't care.  You'd still fuck her.  Oh, my dad still wouldn't even talk to her.  Nope.  Not even talk to her.  He doesn't even want to name mention.  The older generation fucking hates her.  Oh, I know.  The newer generation, maybe they have a little more of an open mind.  Call me, bitch.  The older people out there, they fucking hate that bitch.  Yeah.  Yep.  Jim Brewer.  Suck Charlie's cock. 
[03:29:00]  Did we do the movie justice?  Oh, yeah.  More than me?  Yeah.  Anything else you want to add?  Paperback is out.  Cheaper book.  The paperback more than me is out.  Oh, this was based on a book?  No, no, no.  I'm sorry.  The paperback...  I can't even think straight.  My paperback book is out.  I'm not high.  I'm not high.  Enough of these fucking overachievers.  Go to Motley's next week.  For Rich Voss.  All right.  More than me, pre-order the DVD on Facebook or jimbrewer.com, right? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Or just check out the freaking trailer.  I loved it, man.  Yeah.  We played the trailer earlier.  And Ant was bumped out.  I was just like, ah.  It was sad.  And then I had to go, no, Ant, but there are laughs in there.  It was hard laughs in there.  Hard.  Right after it, we had to play Jim Norton singing, working for the weekend to make me  like, laugh.  He's got fucking good crews, man, this guy.  He knows how to put together a fucking crew. 
[03:30:00]  Dude, you guys, I'm telling you, it was amazing to be in freaking Amsterdam, playing in Amsterdam.  That's so funny.  And every night, people go, I listen on Opie and Antony.  I listen.  We love Opie and Antony.  I want to go there so bad.  Were you doing a theater there?  I noticed that.  No, I was doing Tueller.  People from Amsterdam for some reason, yeah.  It's a comedy club.  Not for Marcel?  What?  Marcel is the guy, a promoter, that books a lot of the stuff.  I don't remember.  I guess he felt like he didn't talk.  I know.  It was too much. 
[03:30:30]  I called you guys from Amsterdam once.  Did you?  Jesus Christ.  Look, don't fucking turn, you fucking, you revolving door douchebag.  Oh, you should see fucking Sam rolling his eyes.  I don't give a fuck about Sam.  He's barely on the payroll.  I didn't do anything.  I'm talking to my friend.  Sam does a good job hosting comedy by request.  Thank you, Jim.  Oh, look at you.  Thank you.  But more importantly, Cigars and Scotch is back.  He wants to know if Pat Benatar's Hit Me With Your Best Shot is in your documentary. 
[03:31:00]  You need humor.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You need that.  You need that.  This is true.  You gotta laugh.  Rolling Stones, one hit to the body.  We could go all day with this.  Poor dad.  Good stuff, man.  He's in great shape now.  A war vet.  He's in great shape.  That's fucking very good.  He's in great shape.  You see the movie and laugh hard.  You have a Pizza Man update, I heard?  Here's the Pizza Man update.  For the people that have been following that saga.  Let me.  It's too long to get into now, so just give the update.  Here's the update. 
[03:31:30]  We're going to court.  I so badly just want to give the court date and all that so people can come watch.  People show up.  Because you can go to a court and watch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But here's the interesting thing.  He's got two court dates that day.  Two different scenarios.  Oh, for two different things?  Yeah.  Same thing.  And because it's open, our court date is in about a week or so. 
[03:32:00]  And it's for him aggressively following my wife.  Jesus.  With the kid in the car and an infant in the car, which he has done before.  Not with my wife, but with other women in town, babysitters.  Maybe he's making a delivery.  It could be.  And I think that's his defense. 
[03:32:30]  I died delivery for.  15 minutes to last, right?  So at the end of the day, that will be, you know, will be done.  And you know what was really amazing was?  My wife wanted nothing to do with it.  And she went, I don't want to give him the, I don't want to give him an ounce of energy  and to think that he scared me.  And of course, this is your wife and your kid.  So the thoughts through me were not very pleasant. 
[03:33:00]  And so I actually found, I, dude, you know, I'm in a good place.  I literally said, you know, if I come across him, I will talk to him like a man, try to  hash things out.  Well, I literally saw him.  Oh, no.  Pulled up alongside of him.  And as God is my freaking witness on my kids' lives, this is how it ended.  It ended me by me going, you know, what did you think?  At this tone, what did you think was going to happen following my wife? 
[03:33:30]  And he goes, takes a drag of a cigarette and he goes, you know, you wife, she go, but  she a liar.  And you're going to have to prove I was in the car.  I don't even drive a car that day.  I said, listen, listen, you know, like a 14 year old boy stomping his feet.  You will never get in there.  And I said, I've caught you in lies before.  People will catch you in lies all the time. 
[03:34:00]  My kid was in the car and then he looked at me and said, is she a liar too?  Oh, fuck.  And so that's, that's when I just went and he stuck his hand out to shake my hand.  Oh my God.  And I said, you're shit to me.  You're a faggot.  He went, faggot?  Faggot?  I said, yeah, faggot.  Get out of here, faggot.  And he started pulling the car away.  And I said, you know, you live at home and mommy, you go, I'm going to go on your boobie  and go back down.  And so that's how it ended. 
[03:34:30]  But he, he means nothing to me anymore.  He really doesn't.  He's, I realize it's not even just me.  It's everywhere.  The, the, the, these guys got to go into court with them.  These people go into court with them.  He's in court.  They're trying, he's trying to get his guns back that the cops confiscated.  So it's, it's an ongoing thing.  He's in the next town now doing what he does there and good riddance to him.  God bless him. 
[03:35:00]  I wish him nothing but great things.  But I mean, how's the pizza from what I heard, you'd have to ask the customer.  How many people do you have to get in the courtroom to hit bonus?  It would be kind of cool if, if people were there and I'm sure some may show up because  all you have to do is look up for it.  It's not gonna be hard to figure out where we're from.  And the other cases from what I heard, well, it's, it's open.  The other cases they, the police caught him, caught him fake police reporting where he, 
[03:35:30]  where he called the police, said he don't know where his wife is and he fears the fears  his children are missing.  But after he just hung up with her and so they, now they went to the hat.  The cops went looking all over.  They're making out the reports and so what they did though, is they said, we need, they  finally got her and she's like, I've been talking to him all day and said, give us your cell 
[03:36:00]  phone.  Found all the phone calls, found all the conversations.  He's dead meat.  He's done.  I like to see what he, I think there's, I'm not gonna lie to you.  It sounds like, it sounds like there may be a, I, I would say there's a drug addiction.  No, Anthony doesn't follow people.  But I, it sounds like a blow addict mentality.  Yeah.  You don't know for sure though.  No, I don't.  I absolutely do not. 
[03:36:30]  But I don't know for sure.  I have no clue.  But because again, like my mom, I don't know where, where, where does your mentality go?  There's so much you can do.  Just make your pizza.  Yeah.  Enjoy your customers.  Enjoy life.  Enjoy your children.  Why create so much drama?  Why?  No one cares about it.  Just enjoy your life, man.  Get on with your life.  Get on with your life.  All right.  So.  Welcome to Gandhi radio. 
[03:37:00]  You must listen.  The, the, the, the, karma.  You cannot act like this.  This life is too short.  The, the, the, the, the, the, the.  Bro, you got to come back because I want to hear about your summer vacation with your family.  Oh, that was a good time.  You went across America and you also went across Europe, right?  Yeah, I worked with, uh, yeah, I was in England.  Did a metal festival there.  It was Metallica and the big four.  Wow.  And I played Germany.  It was Ozzy and Judas Priest.  Jesus.  That's awesome.  It was sick.  It was sick.  Can you come back and talk about it all the time? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, of course I can.  I was doing stand up with those audiences.  I mean, that, I was scared to death, but because I literally did, I remembered years  ago, I used to talk about the metal years ago and I'd do the band and I just did that  and freaking crushed, crushed, mutilated.  Steve-O was on the bill with me in England from Jackass.  Yeah.  Mutilated.  Killed?  Mutilated.  They loved him.  You're like, ah, dudes, I'm going to drink this water and I'm going to stick it on my forehead, 
[03:38:00]  but I'm going to put my arms out.  So I'm like, I can't touch the fucking bottle of water.  And I'm going to fucking drink the whole thing without spilling a fucking drop, dudes.  Sounds fucking impossible.  You think it's impossible?  Cheer me on.  Heel out.  Heel out.  And you know what he takes?  He puts on his head, does his whole circus act, and in two minutes he's drinking the thing.  Now I'm going to fucking light my hair on fire and I'm going to fucking do this somersault,  dude, dude.  It's fucking amazing. 
[03:38:30]  It's because I'm doing Pilates.  And so I'm going to fucking jump over the table and blow my fucking hair up.  I need to be the fucking champ, dudes.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Light my fire.  Bling back.  Hey, man.  Good night.  Good night.  Thanks fucking England.  It was really fucking cool to be here.  Oh, wait.  You said that.  He just mutilated.  Did you have to follow him?  No.  Thank God it went before him.  Wow.  And part of me, the comic, I'm crushing so hard. 
[03:39:00]  I look on the side and he's on the stairs looking at me, laughing, admiring what I'm doing.  And part of me is like, hope you can follow this.  Oh, shit.  I'm just saying.  And follow it was not the word that he did.  Wow.  It was like he was Metallica.  Well, when you eat light bulbs.  Dude, I'm going to fucking take this glass and I'm going to stick it through my nipple.  I know it sounds gross.  I have a fucking beard.  But dude, I don't even fucking drink anymore.  That's a fucking crazy thing. 
[03:39:30]  You got that down.  He was pretty heavy.  He was funny and he was good.  That's great.  I don't know if I can call him.  A lot of people have to piss.  All right, man.  Take a fucking piss.  Berkeley Carteret tomorrow night.  Me and Bonnie.  She's working with me.  That's Rich Voss, obviously.  Asbury Park.  And then Motley's in Boston next weekend.  Motley's in Boston next weekend.  That place, pack out.  Get some.  I don't fail.  You know that.  I don't fail.  No, you really don't, Voss.  You were great today, too, by the way. 
[03:40:00]  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  You were great as well.  Thank you, brother.  Brewer, more than me.  This documentary is terrific.  Pre-order the DVD on Facebook or Jim Brewer.com.  I can't wait to read the comments today.  And then maybe come back maybe next week or something.  With an update.  Yes.  With an update after the court date.  But I want to hear about the summer vacation thing.  We'll talk about the summer vacation thing.  All right, we'll figure it out.  Brewer will be back soon.  Enjoy your weekend.  We got our 9-11 show, I guess, Sunday.  I don't know.  From 10 years ago, we're replaying what went down on that fateful day. 
[03:40:30]  What, you guys are coming in on Sunday?  No.  It's a show from 10 years ago.  Just repackaged or something.  I've never heard it before, so whatever.  All right, guys.  The virus.  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, what a show.  What a way to cap off an amazing return week from vacation. 
[03:41:00]  I'm Sam Roberts.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  A lot of shows, radio shows, that is, they go on, the hosts go on vacation.  And they're a little groggy when they get back.  And the first few shows back are a little rough.  Keep in mind, Opie was gone for two full weeks.  Anthony was gone for a full week.  Usually, when radio show hosts take that kind of time off, it takes a little while to start rolling back. 
[03:41:30]  It takes at least a week to start rolling back.  But let me tell you something.  From start of Tuesday to end of Friday, an amazing week of shows, capped off by, I mean, Brewer coming in.  And just, how did, he tears the house down every time he comes in here.  There's so much stuff going on with that guy.  And the way he just pulls up, like, we've all heard.  Stories about Brewer's mother and father before.  But never like that.  None of us knew that that type of psychotic trauma was going on in Brewer's life. 
[03:42:00]  And then when he got his mom on the phone.  I mean, we started the show with Voss' story about the fire and everything.  And that was great.  But then Brewer came in, and no offense to Voss.  Brewer took it to a whole other level.  And, I mean, the only thing I could think of, because we've all heard Obie's mom stories before.  Brewer coming up with this, I mean, amazing.  If you missed any of today's show, I would highly recommend the replay.  I mean, I recommend the replay almost every day.  But I would definitely recommend it today. 
[03:42:30]  Anyway, I mean, we have to do a special about moms on the show.  Like a just...  Eric, what do you think?  I mean, I know you're kind of the worst of guy.  Yeah, I definitely think we should do that.  Because you got, you know, Obie has got countless mom stories.  Ant's got some good mom stories, too.  Ant's got good mom stories.  And you mix in, if it's his mom and his dad, that counts, too.  The spaghetti incident, whatever you want to play.  I think the same thing falls for Jim, because he doesn't have specific parent stories. 
[03:43:00]  No, he's got...  He has them, they're all together.  Yeah, and he's got great mom stories.  Travis has a legendary mom story.  You have some great mom segments.  My mom is psychotically overprotective, thinks I'm still a child.  And at 28 is, you know, still figuring that I'm 12.  The way she keeps everything.  My mom still has my schoolwork from first and second grade in the house.  Like, that's where she's at.  And I know it's not the same as watching your mother box your elderly father's ears when 
[03:43:30]  he complains about not being able to hear.  It's just psychotic on a different, in a different way.  And I mean, that's why...  And Danny!  Danny had a great mom story.  Remember the voicemail?  Oh, right, right.  Didn't, like...  Well, Danny's mom call him a cunt or something like that?  He played some...  Yeah, I gotta look back.  It was something about she played some voicemail that she was disappointed that she had him  or something.  It was something really, really bad.  So, I mean, obviously, we got enough for a whole show here. 
[03:44:00]  I don't know when the next long weekend or something, because this is going to be an  epic show.  This is something we gotta hype up.  This is something we gotta promote.  And...  I'm sorry, go ahead.  We gotta have a celebrity host, obviously.  We do?  Yeah, I mean, of course.  Get some press releases out.  I don't know who...  How about your mom host the show?  She'll come in here.  Your mom and your dad.  That's actually a great idea.  And maybe not even put any clips of my mom on, since she's hosting.  No, no, no, no.  She can...  Your mom and your dad could come in and host. 
[03:44:30]  Maybe Ope can sit in there with them, do a little, uh...  Do a little interview with them.  Ope gets weird when my mom's around.  Ope does...  No, but she'll bring baked goods.  Ope does a weird thing where, like, when he's with...  When he's around my mother...  And I...  It's weird, in general, that Opie should be talking to my mother at all.  Like, Mars, has Opie ever met your mother?  Of course not.  Yeah, but he's talked to...  And he gets, like, especially now that he's more comfortable with my mother, I'm picking  up kind of, like, a flirtation thing going on between the two of them.  Even better. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, it's a very strange...  Even more reason we should have them all together.  And it's not just Opie that I'm blaming, saying, uh, Opie's hitting on my mom, because my  mom is very reciprocal with it.  And it's like, what's going on here?  Well, maybe not even your dad now.  We'll just have your mom and Opie...  Well, no, I think my dad should be included, too.  Your mom and Opie will be in the studio hosting this.  No, my dad...  You don't need to be there.  My dad's done a lot for this show.  He should be included, too.  No, we'll play some of his bits, but he doesn't need to be here to host it.  He should be.  He would like to.  No, you two can go off and do something.  We'll just have Opie and your mom in here, and they'll host a special. 
[03:45:30]  No, no, no, he would like to.  I think it'd be good.  Maybe, maybe Thanksgiving.  That's a great time.  Families getting together for Thanksgiving.  You see, E-Rock, you know what this is called?  Radio synergy.  Ideas coming together.  So it's settled.  Opie and your mom will host the family special for Thanksgiving.  Here's why that's not going to work.  Featuring moms.  That's going to require Opie to be here longer than 30 seconds after the show is off the air.  If your mom is here, he'll stay.  If there's some baked goods here, he'll stay. 
[03:46:00]  And that'll just get weird.  We do have some show business to conduct.  We didn't get to it today because obviously we had a packed show.  First of all, Paul's back.  You're filling in on the phones for, are you here just today?  Are you going to be here next week?  Semi-regular basis.  Okay.  So why don't we call it, instead of you call it semi-regular basis, I'll call it a week-by-week basis.  And call it that.  For those who don't know, Paul used to intern with the show, and now he works here at SiriusXM.  Now he's a freelance Opie and Anthony producer. 
[03:46:30]  I've heard from you.  Yeah, apparently he's a freelance Opie and Anthony producer.  He was here a couple weeks ago, and I guess he's going to be on the phones for a little while.  Troy's doing a little production or whatever.  But I figured they wouldn't let you back in here after your last week.  But apparently you did all right.  Apparently I did okay, yeah.  Are you, well, this is huge then.  You're going to be here next week?  Uh, certain days, yes.  I have to work out of here.  Eric, is next week when the interns are starting? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  I believe next Tuesday, the first intern's starting.  So, Paul, you are going, and they pay you to be here, right?  Yeah, I get a paycheck.  You are going to be a paid employee of SiriusXM on the Opie and Anthony show with interns.  Yes.  Under you.  Which I used to be.  You used to be.  I mean, that's got to be like a dream.  I'm thoroughly excited about it.  And by the way, there's a countless number.  Love Buzz, Evan, David, everybody is sitting at home right now just crying. 
[03:47:30]  Jared.  Yeah, Jared the Fish Boy, Bagel Tits, Craigie Bra.  Craigie Bra.  Oh, no, Bon Jovi got a job.  Not here, though.  No, but not here.  Everybody got a job.  Bon Jovi is sitting home.  Everybody is, everybody, every intern, most of the interns still listen to the show because they were all fans.  And every intern is sitting there going, you have to be fucking kidding.  Matt Ryan, Fat Matt Ryan.  And Fat Matt wanted it bad.  Matt and I have been in contact recently for... 
[03:48:00]  I bet you have.  Hey, Matt, did you hear the news?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  We're going to have a class act.  I've been trying to get him in on my other gig in the sports department.  You're trying to pay it forward now?  Yeah, absolutely.  You're like, listen, Matt, I'm going to take you under my wing and show you the ropes around here.  Now that I'm kind of a serious guy.  If that happens, Paul, you've got to send him for coffee and stuff for you.  Absolutely.  Are you hooking up?  What about Evan, for those that don't remember, is the intern that pissed his pants.  And him and Paul used to fight like women all the time. 
[03:48:30]  Are you going to hook Evan up?  I want Evan back in here.  I would love to.  Look, Matt Ryan.  The last time I spoke to Evan, it didn't end well.  Why not?  He's changed his phone number since.  He's a psycho.  He's out of his mind.  Yeah.  Matt Ryan, if you're listening, former intern, I like you.  You're a good guy.  I like to talk about wrestling.  You're a nice guy.  But Evan is a strange bird.  And I really find him intriguing and interesting.  And that's a person that I would want to talk to every day.  Like the...  I went to his house once and met his parents. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, my God.  You see where it comes from.  That's right.  Evan once got thrown out of his house because he was all hyped up on Ritalin and tore apart his room one night.  And his mom walked into his room in the morning and was like, you have to leave.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Get out.  And he was kicked out of his house for like three days.  That's the type of interesting personality.  And I mean, if we get Steve Sturdiolo in here at some point today, tomorrow, whatever, he will assess to the fact that before there was an after show, when Evan and Paul were interning here, 
[03:49:30]  I would just do the after show for myself talking to Evan and Paul in the hallway.  For whoever was listening.  Remember the day we hid his backpack and he was breaking into other people's studios looking for it?  Yeah, all the interns, I guess, you know, I don't know what goes on with the interns, but the interns, like Paul had the other interns hide Evan's book bag.  And then Evan was just flipping out and I walk in and the interns are just exploding. 
[03:50:00]  That's the intern class I want when it's like they just go crazy when left alone.  It's a great thing.  Oh, it's like substitute teacher day, you know, where when you were in school and you just, you'd go out of your mind and do whatever you could because the teacher was gone.  Right.  It's like, we left you alone for five minutes.  Why don't you guys just go home?  Why don't you just leave?  Yeah.  We don't want to go home.  We do have, though, a show business to conduct because the Win a Date with Bobo contest is happening.  Bobo, if you're listening, which I don't know.  Bobo's, I don't know if anybody's looking at his Twitter, but Bobo's getting really weird. 
[03:50:30]  And this Win a Date with Bobo thing, we have sponsor ties to it.  So it has to happen.  Like, it's not like we're like, yeah, we got to get Bobo back on the air.  Like, this is, what did you say, Roland?  I have a mention from Steve Storniello.  Yeah.  He had to go home because he shit his pants.  Oh, my God.  That's embarrassing.  He got so excited.  He just said, I just shit my pants.  I got to go home.  That's embarrassing.  So, people, he just shit his pants.  But the Win a Date with Bobo thing is happening.  And like I said, we have to do it. 
[03:51:00]  It's going to be a great segment.  It's going to be a great contest and everything.  Free lunch for you.  And I get to have a free lunch because I'm the chaperone.  But, I mean, I don't know.  You check, go to Bobo's Twitter if you know what it is.  I'm not going to plug it.  He's getting very, very weird nude pictures.  Really?  Not solicited by anybody that has anything to do with the show.  One photo looks like he's dead.  Yeah, I mean, and none of this has anything to do with the people who work on the show.  The show, the staff, nothing.  Yeah, it's very strange.  So he's getting weird.  But we are going to talk to him next week. 
[03:51:30]  I think it's next week when we actually do this contest.  But we need to finalize a list.  I think if Danny's around, I don't know if he's listening, but we should have Danny also help us select a finalist.  Because I think we have eight girls, and we have to narrow it down to three.  And I feel like this should be a group activity.  You want Mars rolling, Paul?  Yes, absolutely.  You want to help out?  Absolutely.  Eric, I mean, we'll describe him to you, but you won't be able to see him in there, I guess.  Well, describe it like I'm listening on the other end of the radio. 
[03:52:00]  That'll be my motivation.  She looks better than your brown shirt compared to your tight jet shirt.  Ouch.  That is a workout shirt, Roland.  You're not tricking anybody.  Yeah, it's too small and you don't work out.  What about you, brown silk?  Would you buy that at PiffsRuss?  Yeah, do you know what?  You get that, Roland?  I'll make a proclamation right now.  Roland, that was a...  Hulk Hogan's autograph for somebody will be ruined.  Ouch.  That was a Mikey Piff joke.  And it's going to be the yellow one for his nephew.  Oh. 
[03:52:30]  I take down you and I take down your nephew, sir.  All right, let's talk about these finalists.  Danny's making his way up the hallway as we speak.  The first finalist here, we all know her.  Actually, and this is Lady Trucker.  Holy shit.  Lady Trucker has called into the show a lot over the years or whatever.  And she actually has followed me when I host Raw Dog.  I've been hosting Comedy by Request on Raw Dog every day this week.  And Lady Trucker has called in every single day to Comedy by Request just to drop the end bomb. 
[03:53:00]  I guess he's trying to know his girlfriend.  But I don't know who his girlfriend is.  Danny, what do you think?  The first ball up is Lady Trucker.  Yay or nay?  Well, she's definitely round like a ball.  That's right.  Big woman.  You think, I mean, she's going to take up a lot more couch room than some of the others.  Or maybe.  You could say maybe for now until we see the other.  I just, I don't think she deserves a chance, to be honest, just because she's so obnoxious.  I gotcha.  Okay, so it's a nay.  Yeah, I'm going to say nay on the Lady Trucker. 
[03:53:30]  Roland?  Sorry, Steve Sterniolo.  Stop with the Sterniolo.  What do you think of Lady Trucker?  Nobody knows who Steve Sterniolo is.  What do you think?  Nah.  No.  Another no.  Mars?  I say yeah.  Okay.  Because I want to see Anthony basher.  Okay.  There's constantly some conflict going on there.  Paul?  I'd say no, just based on the fact that she is so obsessed with the show, she should be  able to contact Bobo on her own.  Think about radio.  What's going to make for the best radio?  Is it going to be Lady Trucker? 
[03:54:00]  Lady Trucker.  Is it going to be the big Lady Trucker Bobo date?  Well, Eric, Lady Trucker?  I'd say no.  Okay, I know you hate her, so Lady Trucker's out.  I mean, I don't even have to vote on that one.  Lauren submitted this picture.  Everybody can see this is a picture of Lauren.  She's got dark hair.  She's got a whoopee cushion in the picture.  Very cute girl.  Not a heavy girl like Lady Trucker, but looks good looking, I guess, in her early 20s, it  would appear. 
[03:54:30]  She looks fun.  She's got a whoopee cushion in her mouth.  That says it all.  And she would love to have lunch with Bobo.  She listens every day.  She loves stories about small malfunctioning dicks.  And she's super duper smart and graduated from college with a degree in psychology.  So, uh, Danny, I guess we'll go with you.  Where are you going to vote?  Lauren?  I don't know.  I guess I'll just have to leave this up to the rest of the panel and vote no.  You're going to vote no.  But, okay, you're going to say no.  Roland! 
[03:55:00]  I don't know.  She looks familiar.  Whatever.  Roland.  I can see that far, though.  What do you think?  Maybe, I guess.  You're going to say maybe.  Uh, Paul?  Uh, sure.  You say yes.  Mars?  No.  You say no?  No.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Her description, the end, the psychologist, all that bullshit.  You don't like the psychology?  You fuck smart people.  Is Eric in there?  Maybe if she was an MMA fan, right?  Whoa.  That shit was loud.  That was you, Roland?  Well, for right now, Lauren is a no, then.  I mean, what can we do?  Sorry, Lauren.  What can you say, you know? 
[03:55:30]  Uh, Laura.  Okay.  I mean, not, doesn't look as slim as Lauren, but definitely slimmer than Lady Trucker.  She's a, she's a blonde.  Uh, she's been married for 12 years and has no children.  Uh, but she's been listening to ONA since 98.  She's a private chef.  Uh, Roland?  Yes.  You're the foodie here.  You say yes.  Uh, Danny?  I don't, I don't think so.  Um, I don't know. 
[03:56:00]  I mean, I'm, I'm looking at Bobo's best interests here.  Yeah.  And I know that we still have a few more contestants to go, but I, I'm going to save some yes votes  for some, for some more.  Because we can always go back and.  Yeah, I'm going to save some more yes votes.  So right now, I'm going to be a no.  Mars?  She's married, you said, right?  Married for 12 years.  I say no.  Eric's not in there.  Uh, Paul?  Um.  12 years, no kids?  Yeah.  Well.  All right, we're saying no, I feel like.  I'm going to say no, yeah. 
[03:56:30]  All right, no on Laura.  I want Bobo to have the best time possible.  Okay, well, this is a cute girl here.  Courtney, uh, half Polish, half Filipino.  22, uh, from Connecticut.  She looks cute.  Very girls next door-y, uh, not girls next door-y.  Girl next door-y.  Uh, the Filipino is evident in the, you know, in the skin tone.  Uh, dark hair, uh, little t-shirt and jeans.  Yeah, it says that she's got a bachelor's in communications, so she must have went to college.  So, so, she's out. 
[03:57:00]  Right, Martin Martin's going like that.  That college bullshit.  Um, Paul, what do you think?  I'd say yes.  Give him some, uh, exotic flavor.  Yeah, I mean, Bobo did say that he's very open to different ethnicities.  Uh, Roland?  Sure.  You say yes, Danny?  I'm going to say yeah, because she's, she's half Filipino, she's half Polish, so she might  be stupid enough to give him a handjob.  And I say yes.  You say yes, so Courtney's in.  Congratulations, Courtney.  You just, uh, are one of the, want a chance to be one of the three finalists that are going 
[03:57:30]  to come into this studio.  Uh, next up is Andrea or Andrea.  Uh, another one who I would, cute, in the cute category.  Um, cardigan sweater, so it's kind of hard to exactly see the full body type.  Uh, dark hair, shoulder length, uh, brown eyes.  29 years old.  She lives in Alabama.  Uh, she's a former teacher in NYC and Alabama.  But Travis assured me that all these people would be able to come to New York. 
[03:58:00]  Uh.  I'd say yes, just to see if she'll actually make it.  Okay, that's a good, you know, somebody from Alabama making it all the way.  Uh, what do you think, Paul?  Uh, Eric's back.  Eric is back.  I'd say yes, because I, in the hopes that she'd have an accent and Bubba wouldn't be  able to understand her.  Okay, Danny?  Well, I guess we're running out of chicks, right?  How many we got left here?  Um, that's five of eight.  We still have three.  Still have three to go.  Six, seven, and eight.  I'm holding out. 
[03:58:30]  I'm going to say no.  I'm holding out.  I'm going to say yes.  You're going to say, that's enough yeses to get Courtney through, but we could change  our minds.  A tiebreaker or something.  Uh, I mean, that's not Courtney.  That's, uh, Andrea.  Andrea.  Andrea.  Andrea.  She's a yes for now, but we'll see what happens.  All right.  Well, this chick has to win.  Is that a princess?  Christy.  She doesn't look at me.  No.  Christy Ann is, uh, I, I would say yes just to see her coming to the studio. 
[03:59:00]  Because she looks a little bit, a little resemblance to Jess.  You think so?  Just a little bit.  All right.  What do you think?  You just saved my ass.  Um, yeah.  I don't think she looks anything like that.  Jess is way cuter than that.  Hi, Jess.  Oh, okay.  Well, I mean, I, yeah, think that too.  Um, she's from, uh, Wayne.  She's 23.  She's a college student.  So Mars is, she doesn't like, Mars doesn't like educated women.  But I mean, I, yeah, I would say yes to Christy Ann.  Me gusta.  Yeah, okay, Mars. 
[03:59:30]  Yes, absolutely.  Roland.  Yes.  Paul.  Of course.  Eric.  Look at the, yeah, uh, Pips.  Yeah.  Yeah, everybody.  Christy Ann, you just, uh, are definitely, definitely in.  Because look, I mean, their strategy involves in this as well.  I mean, it's not like we're just picking girls willy-nilly.  Um, the hotter the girl is at this point.  Right.  Like, the fucking nutty, the more nuts Bobo is gonna get.  I mean, Bobo could froth at just about anything.  But, I mean, if there's like a super smoking girl sitting across the room, uh, at the table from him,  I mean, he's gonna be.  And, and the way that you have to win this contest is Bobo has to remember how you describe 
[04:00:00]  yourself after you orally dictate it to him.  So, yeah, I mean, Bobo freaking out would be much better.  Yeah, you know what, and I think she, a girl like her might throw him for a loop because  he, he's not gonna be paying attention.  And it looks like.  He's just gonna be staring.  It looks like here in this picture she's wearing some kind of bustier or something,  so hopefully she could wear something revealing to the studio to really excite Bobo.  I know Bobo likes, uh, breasts and butts.  So, that's something unique about Bobo. 
[04:00:30]  Um, alright, so Christiane is in, or I think that's how you pronounce her name.  Next is Jackie.  I see.  You have, you can't, you have to be a human person to enter this contest.  Yeah, that's a tiger.  But, uh, Jackie is 26.  I guess it's this one.  Which one is Jackie?  Well, that one's an old woman.  Uh, Jackie is 26, so I'm assuming she's the blonde.  Uh, Daniel would benefit to be seen with a woman of my caliber.  However, his experience with me would help boost his loathsome self-esteem and pathetic  public image.  So, she's very full of herself. 
[04:01:00]  She's, she's, uh, definitely bashing Bobo and thinks that her shit don't stink is what  I get from that.  You like that.  So, you're gonna say yes.  I say yes.  Because you like when, to see somebody get bashed.  Eric, what do you think?  And, uh, how are we doing on time?  Um, we, we got about 10 minutes.  Oh, great, great, great.  Um, how many, how many slots are left open?  Well, excuse, that's, they're people.  They're women.  Incredibly rude.  I apologize.  I mean, technically we have three, but we would, if we said yes to her, we would have  to replace either Courtney or Andrea, and there was some question about- 
[04:01:30]  We could always go back and Andrea.  Keep her as a maybe, though.  Okay.  I'm gonna, well, I know, maybe I'm speaking out of tone.  I'm gonna say yes, because I'm reading her description, and there's a piece of that  that's just blaring, that's, that screams fun.  And the part is, although I am not a regular listener to the Opie and Anthony show, as I  do not have satellite radio, my uncle keeps talking about how great the show is and has  persuaded me to sign up for this contest.  Okay, that is a good reason.  Okay, she might have just taken Andrea's spot. 
[04:02:00]  But, because look, I would love to see this girl who is not necessarily familiar with  all of Bobo's, um, the up and down game.  She has to know the up and down game, for God's sake.  So, I think introducing somebody new on this kind of a level could be fun for everybody.  Okay, so what do you guys think?  I say you're a sweater girl.  Yeah, Andrea with the blue sweater.  Replace.  You remember her?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I know you don't like to be mean, but replace her?  Yeah.  Paul?  Uh, yeah, based on what Danny said. 
[04:02:30]  Eric?  I didn't see her, but go ahead.  Okay, Jackie is in.  I'm sorry, Andrea, you had a moment of glory.  Uh, but you are out.  And Jackie is in.  Jackie is not listening to the show right now because she's never heard it before.  Fantastic.  You're so stupid.  And I guess this is the last one.  Well, her picture looks fantastic.  Yeah.  This is, uh, Leah, and the reason I say that is because the picture she submitted is a picture  she took with me.  I thought that, oh, I thought that was a girl.  I was going to say who's the gay guy. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, well, I beat you all, didn't I?  Although Paul got one in real quick.  You got to be quick in this game, Morris.  Paul's learned that, and he's so young.  Um, she's 22.  You're older than me, right?  Yes.  Yep.  She's 22.  She's from Connecticut, and she's a huge O&A fan.  Uh, she'd show Bobo a good time, drink, play some, I know Bobo likes to get his drink  on.  Uh, drink, play some arcade games, get some good food, and who knows, maybe go to a nice  strip club where some lucky gal will have the pleasure of dancing on that little abomination 
[04:03:30]  of a cock.  Now, sounds like she's, uh, in the spirit for a good time, but what I don't like is she  wants a stripper to do her dirty work for her.  Or she thinks she's fun, though.  I say no.  You don't like a girl who thinks she's fun.  Eric, you're shaking your head?  No.  You don't like the vibe?  Yeah, you know why?  Because she's a cock tease.  You think so?  She's like, yeah, we're going to go out to dinner and play games.  Like, games, a drink, and then you can do anything that you want on your own.  Well, uh, she says, I sure wouldn't mind winning $1,000 to start nursing school with  either. 
[04:04:00]  Oh.  Now, I know, Mars, you say automatic no.  It's not education.  It was a psychology part that got on my nerves.  I know you don't like education.  No.  Um.  He's like the Pink Floyd song.  We didn't need that education.  That doesn't sway you guys, though?  No.  The nursing school thing?  Ugh.  All right.  Well, let me, let me, then we have our final three, it looks like.  It looks like, let me get the confirmation.  Jackie, who is a 26-year-old blonde, resident of Manhattan, who's never heard the show before,  but her uncle told her to.  Definitely.  Yes. 
[04:04:30]  Uh.  Yes.  Christiane, who's just the hottest chick on the list.  And, uh, last but not least, Courtney, the cute Filipino girl, is there anybody, Courtney  is the maybe, is there anybody that we've seen, because those are all the contestants  that are eligible, is there any, we narrowed it down and stuff, a lot of people, is there  anybody that we've seen that you would rather see there than Courtney?  Uh, do you want Laura to get the gig, or, uh, or Lauren, or Lady Trucker, is the last 
[04:05:00]  one.  Um, any thoughts, or are we gonna, I'm gonna scroll through these pictures one more time.  That was Lady Trucker?  That was Lady Trucker.  I thought that was Mars.  Right, yeah.  And I didn't mean, I mean the planet.  I mean the planet.  Yeah, yeah.  Scrolling through one more time, right now, it looks like Courtney, unless anybody, I mean.  Maybe Carnegie Sweater Girl.  You want Andrea over Courtney.  What do you, what is anybody, can I get a second on that?  I would rather have the Filipino.  Okay.  No second on that, so. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, if we're choosing between.  Courtney and Andrea.  Andrea.  It's gonna be Courtney.  Okay, and then, let's see if there's anybody else we're skipping over.  Courtney versus Leah.  I'm still going Courtney.  Okay.  Well then we have our final three!  Yeah, yeah!  Congratulations, I'm going to put Leah down in case one of those final three cancel at the  last minute as the backup.  Is that good by everybody?  Alright, so now that these are narrowed down.  Well wait, wouldn't you put the cardigan girl down? 
[04:06:00]  Because she got more yes votes.  Who's better, Leah or the cardigan girl?  It's tough.  That is tough.  Who do you think?  I'm a cardigan girl.  You like her.  Yeah, I would say cardigan girl too.  You like her too.  You think she's got a little more personality.  There's a little bit of wholesomeness there.  It's just not all a party fun girl.  Alright, I'm going to put Andrea as our backup.  But, the final three are Courtney, Christiane, and Jackie.  This is very exciting for the win a day with Bobo.  The date will probably go down, I think next week is the plan. 
[04:06:30]  I would assume on a Thursday, so we could talk about it on Friday.  Obviously, I have no idea what I'm talking about, but these are all assumptions.  But, what will happen is, those three girls, Courtney, Christiane, and Jackie.  Congratulations to all three of you again.  Jackie, congratulations to your uncle.  He'll tell you about this.  Will come into the studio.  They'll all describe themselves to Bobo.  Bobo will then, after all three are done, have to remember. 
[04:07:00]  He's not allowed to pen and paper, and there may be some distractions thrown in his way.  But, Bobo will then have to dictate back what all three girls said about themselves.  Whoever Bobo can remember the most about will be the woman who wins the $1,000 and who goes on a date with Bobo.  So, I mean, you know, you're going to, you know, you're going to want to, we're going to have to have some criteria. 
[04:07:30]  We're going to talk to you beforehand.  Maybe, like, I don't know, a paragraph of information.  So, you all are going to have the same amount of information for Bobo to remember.  And, I mean, it's kind of out of your hands.  You just have to make yourselves memorable, try to think of the most interesting things about you,  and, you know, look sexy, because if you come here looking hot, Bobo is going to want to remember what you said,  and he may concentrate more, like Christiane, I'm assuming, Bobo would focus on. 
[04:08:00]  I mean, not to take anything away, maybe Courtney will show up and she'll be a knockout, because these are all just pictures.  Now, let me just make sure that I have this straight so I understand it.  So, these girls come in, and then Bobo's going to pick one of the girls,  and then we're going to pay her $1,000 to have sex with Bobo.  Again, you got the whole thing wrong.  No?  The girl will get $1,000 as a prize, and then she'll go on a lunch date with Bobo,  and then she'll actually wake Roland up from his slumber.  Because I just thought you were sleeping, Roland. 
[04:08:30]  I was talking to you three minutes ago, and you're already asleep.  You have a serious problem.  So, wait, they get $1,000 and have to buy Bobo lunch?  No.  Oh, no.  The $1,000, I...  It's to fuck Bobo.  No, that's prostitution.  Yeah, I thought that's what this was all about.  I mean, you can fuck Bobo if you want, but you don't have to.  You go on just a lunch date with him.  I will have the funds to take care of the lunch.  So, we should really be paying these girls in roses, right?  No.  It's not roses. 
[04:09:00]  They're not escorts.  They win 1,000 roses.  No.  And then we're...  It's for their time.  We're paying them for their company.  For their company, right.  Literally, not, you know, it's not, you know, lingo.  We're actually paying for their time.  By time, you mean sex.  No!  Time.  We're going to someplace in Times Square.  Paying for their company.  Yes.  We're going to go.  It'll be a lunch.  Go out.  You and Bobo will make, hopefully, a love connection. 
[04:09:30]  Have a good time.  And then Friday, we'll come back on the show.  I'm going to record some audio of you and...  I have an awkward question.  Yeah.  Let's say they decide to, I don't know, use $1,000 to get a hotel room and have sex.  They're allowed.  Do you have to be there to record it?  Well, I don't have to, but I take my job seriously.  And so I would think that ONA would want some kind of recording, audio, you know, whatever  it is, of Bobo losing his virginity, especially if we're the ones responsible for it. 
[04:10:00]  I feel like we're owed that.  So I would like to be in attendance for that.  Plus, who doesn't want to see Bobo having sex?  Bobo is not a virgin, by the way.  It's a misconception.  Really?  I don't think he's a virgin, but it's not true.  His brother actually fucked him.  Okay.  So he's lost his anal virginity.  Yeah, he's done.  Okay, okay.  I didn't realize.  Cherries popped a long time ago.  Well, listen, the winner date with Bobo will probably go down next week, I think.  Congratulations to the winners.  It's going to be a fun day on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:10:30]  So I don't know if it'll be as much fun as today, because today was a blast.  Tune in to the replay at 3 p.m.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I'll be on Comedy by Request and then interviewing Nick Swardson with Steve Sterniolo at 2 p.m.  on Raw Dog today.  So, yeah, there's still a lot of radio to go.  Yeah.  This is just the end of this show.  Stay tuned.  Hey, secretshowtothefuture.com.  Oh, yeah.  What?  I've heard that's coming.  I may have to order a print, especially if my face is on it, like it's on the website. 
[04:11:00]  Secretshowtothefuture.com for the information on something that's going on.  It's a secret.  I can't wait.  Tune in.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.
