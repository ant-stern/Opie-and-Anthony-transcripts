<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with comedian Colin Quinn in studio, alongside a focus on their deeply troubled intern, "Lady Di," whose week-long internship has been marked by excessive drinking, vomiting in the studio sink, excessive toilet paper usage, and frequent Starbucks runs for bathroom access.  The hosts and Quinn relentlessly detail her appearance and hygiene, using crude and sexually suggestive language.  Lady Di's heavy-drinking roommate, Bill, is frequently mentioned as urging her to seek rehab.  Dr. Steve and Dr. Lydia call in, respectively recommending medical tests and psychological support for Lady Di, who participates in the discussion, defensively denying problems and offering excuses.  The segment culminates in plans for a makeover and a potential intervention, interwoven with ongoing speculation about Lady Di’s breast size and further crude commentary.

The show then transitions to a lengthy discussion about listener Diana, also struggling with alcohol, with several concerned calls, including one from Diana's friend Marion.  Simultaneously, the hosts speculate on the disappearance of flight MH370.  Diana is present in studio undergoing a makeover,  with the conversation oscillating between her situation (and attempts to get her help from Dr. Steve and Dr. Lydia) and MH370 updates.  Funny moments include Diana’s makeover, arguments between the hosts and callers (especially Marion), and highly offensive language from callers toward Marion.  The segment ends with Diana's makeover reveal and further humorous exchanges, including a story about her disastrous grocery store job.  Callers range from supportive to extremely hostile towards Marion, who is repeatedly attacked verbally.

The next segment begins with a caller, Jay, recounting a parking debacle.  The discussion shifts to the show’s makeup artist, Alyssa Bono, and then to MH370, with an interview of Mike Baker (a self-proclaimed former CIA operative) discussing theories surrounding the disappearance.  Speculation includes mechanical failure, terrorism, and pilot action, along with criticism of media coverage and public speculation.  A brief, confusing exchange with "Dr. Orbani" occurs.  Mike Baker makes an insensitive shark joke, prompting apologies and criticism.  The segment transitions to anticipation for Rick Harrison from "Pawn Stars,"  with further extended banter focused on Lady Di's disruptive behavior and unusual comments (including a desire for anal penetration by a host).  Lady Di presents items for Harrison to appraise (a Dale Earnhardt Jr. hat and a Ron Jeremy t-shirt) before the segment ends.

The show continues with Rick Harrison’s late arrival, followed by joking comments on his celebrity status.  The conversation with Harrison covers his show, pawn business experiences, interest in artifacts and firearms, and business approach.  Lady Di repeatedly interrupts with irrelevant comments and attempts to sell items to Harrison, making outlandish demands.  Harrison appears horrified and exasperated.  Listener calls follow, some supportive, others critical of Lady Di and the hosts.  A caller mentions the death of Frenchie, a previous show regular.  Lady Di's disruptive behavior persists, and the hosts express exhaustion.  The segment ends with plans to possibly feature Lady Di again.

Finally, a segment unfolds featuring a chaotic and sexually charged conversation among the hosts and Marion.  The focus shifts between in-studio banter, attempts to find Marion a job (with inappropriate suggestions), and discussions of Marion's personality and behavior, using highly offensive language.  Jimmy Norton's vacation and Colin Quinn's visit are mentioned, describing Marion's overly flirtatious and aggressive behavior towards Quinn.  Opie's drinking habits and health concerns are discussed vulgarly.  The segment concludes with sexually suggestive comments about Marion's appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's a great idea, right?  Jesus.  Colin Quinn in studio.  The mastermind behind the Lady Di internship program.  He's responsible.  Yeah, apparently.  No other radio show in the world would have the boss who pulled this off.  And committed to it.  You guys are doing it.  We know it's going to be a bust by the end of the week.  We're going to run out of steam.  That little thing, she brought me a Diet Coke.  Yeah.  She wore a tight red sweater today. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, she was very happy to see you, Carl.  It's filling out well.  It shows off her boobs.  Her boobs.  Whatever the heck.  Whatever she calls them, the boobs.  The boobs, right?  I noticed Jimmy giving her a little glance.  I actually did check her ass out as she walked up.  Were you checking her ass out?  I didn't even know I did it until Colin reminded me.  I just looked at her ass like this.  And I noted that the sweater was too long for a good view.  A good view.  Wearing her mom jeans.  It looks like she might have took a bath or showered two days in a row. 
[00:01:00]  She may have showered.  Her hair looks, you know.  Not as greasy.  Not as greasy.  It was good yesterday, too.  It was full of balance and luster.  It was windblown.  It was windblown.  Maybe she feels like she has a purpose now.  That she comes in.  You know, when you're just at home like that, just drink in.  Yeah, it's depressing.  Yeah, it's depressing.  Now, she realized after the first day was a complete disaster.  The second day, even worse.  No, the second day was worse.  Oh, believe me.  I'm like, the first day, complete.  I don't think the first day was a complete disaster. 
[00:01:30]  I think day two was the complete disaster.  She was bad day one.  We just didn't realize it yet.  Right.  And then day two, she was even worse.  And we saw what was going on.  We think she went through some kind of withdrawals or something.  Withdrawal, yeah.  Some alcohol withdrawal.  Because now she's definitely better.  She was better yesterday.  Yeah, she slapped herself together a little bit.  And now I think she's back on the road to recovery.  I think so.  It's the O&A, a one-week rehab.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's kind of a stop-in rehab.  Right. 
[00:02:00]  You get some tough love.  You're fat.  You're ugly.  Kill yourself.  When you go home, and the next day you get more of it.  This thing has taken some twists and turns, though.  Oh, yeah.  It was all fun and games, but then it kind of got sad there for a little while.  Colin, what's your thoughts so far on this whole thing?  Have you been listening?  Yes, of course I've been listening.  What are some of your highlights?  My highlight so far is the way she was peppering Bell Knox for her, you know, how much money she made.  And then Marion with the tough love session yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yeah, Marion.  Boy, can she just plow through anything, can't she?  Yeah, what narcissism.  She's good.  The name Babel.  She's got to turn it around and make it about herself, no matter what it is.  Yeah, she's talking about moving to Florida in five or six years like that.  You know, you know, guy, that I'm going to retire with money.  But she talks about, like, it's happening next week.  Yeah.  It's five, six years away.  She's got a five-year plan.  But she keeps saying how many times she said it, like, how many times have I told you?  It's like, all right, you said it. 
[00:03:00]  You get the credit.  Right.  Yeah.  And then, of course.  She does go on a couple of cruises.  Yeah.  Well, then I was going to say the lady died 80s.  Oh, my God.  That was a real.  She had a hell of a time in the 80s.  Oh, just after the shift.  The guy's like, come on, let's go.  I bet she knew.  I go, what kind of car?  Olds.  She remembers that car.  Of course she remembers.  She knows.  When you have to get it up the ass every day, every weekend, you know the car.  Every weekend in the 80s. 
[00:03:30]  In the 80s.  Power windows right next to your ear.  Oh, yeah.  Power windows.  That's it.  Oh, there's the collage.  Yeah, she's a little cutie there.  She had that 80s jacket, that little, I remember that.  A little satin jacket thing going on.  Sure.  A lot of people are saying either Tina Fey.  She had a Tina Fey look or a, what's her name from Edward Scissorhands?  Winona.  Winona.  Yeah.  A little Winona Ryder thing going on. 
[00:04:00]  She definitely was not bad.  No.  She was about a five and a half, six.  Then there's the one Downs hair doing the top right that really fucking wrecks the entire  collage.  Oh, yeah.  Well, if you recall, that is when we used to give her the mustache, the Oliver Hardy mustache.  We give her the Oliver Hardy mustache because she had the hair and everything.  But in Magic Marker.  They would paint that in Magic Marker, put an Oliver Hardy mustache on her.  And we thought it was bad then. 
[00:04:30]  Well, we got something for today.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  A little makeover.  Yeah, yeah.  A little makeover's going down today.  A little makeover action.  A little bit.  Where is she?  She went to get her pocketbook.  Yeah, she went to get her pocketbook.  She didn't come back.  She disappeared.  No.  She was supposed to come back.  She had something to say.  That was a while ago.  It was a while ago.  She might do it a pit stop in the bathroom.  But she's dolling up.  No, she can't go in these bathrooms.  Sam, where's the guy that brought her to the Starbucks?  Because I heard he has a story to tell.  Her walker? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  I'll bring him in.  Yeah, Colin, she's not allowed to use the bathrooms here.  She has to be taken for walks like a dog, a little puppy.  She went to Starbucks and had no toilet paper.  No toilet paper because she used it all the whole day.  After the Ugly Betty incident.  That's my favorite highlight.  I don't know if you would like to talk about that.  The fact that Ugly Betty.  That's my favorite.  It's the best.  Saw her pretty much naked.  Yeah, she was naked.  She decided she would change all her clothes outside the stall.  And throwing up.  You were on a TV series for however many years Ugly Betty was on. 
[00:05:30]  You were doing movies.  Now she's in a Cesar Chavez movie.  You kind of be treated like whatever's the best facility you get to use.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to pee.  I'm in serious silence.  She walks in and sees that thing.  That's great.  There it is.  And she was vomiting in the sink.  I love that she vomits in the sink and it wasn't even an accident.  That's just where I like to throw up.  I like that she was going, come out, come out.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, come out.  Get it out.  Get it out.  I got to get it out.  I got to get it out.  I got to get it out.  I got to get it out.  I got to get it out.  I got to get it out.  I got to get it out.  I got to get it out of words like a sorcerer is chanting. 
[00:06:00]  I got to get it out.  Talking about her duties.  Oh, here she is.  Lady Di.  What's she wearing today?  Why don't you take the seat of honor?  Take a seat over there.  It looks like you're eating today.  That's good.  That's a good sign.  Wow, that is a good sign.  Oh, you're hungry today.  You're hungry.  Drinking a Schweppes.  Yeah, you look better.  Thank you.  You look better.  What happened after the show yesterday?  Did you go right home?  I went right home.  You didn't go to TGI Fridays?  It was, uh, what I did the other day, I was, I felt so bad about that. 
[00:06:30]  What?  Spending all that money?  Spending most of the money in one place.  Oh, boy.  That wasn't right.  Yeah, when you desperately need money, it's probably not the smartest thing.  My mom used to have a word for that.  It was a certain type of rich.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yes, it was temporarily rich, I believe.  I know what the word is, but I ain't going to say it.  Oh, good girl.  I've been called that, too.  Ah.  Right.  What are you eating today?  By the person that I live with.  Oh, forget it.  Bill.  That's the one that called me there.  Bill's a, a lot of people are concerned, too, that Bill is an abusive roommate. 
[00:07:00]  No, we would have saw the bruises.  I don't know.  He might have, maybe like old Tina Turner abuse.  He could be like that.  He hit her with phone books in the body so you couldn't see the bruises.  Oh, wow.  I mean, not physically, just mentally.  Did he beat you when you collaborated with Phil Spector?  We've got to get Dr. Steve on the phone, because he had a long talk with Lady Di on the phone  yesterday, and Bill was yelling and screaming in the background.  Really?  Yes.  Was he yelling and screaming in the background?  He basically was yelling, she needs rehab.  Get her in rehab. 
[00:07:30]  Okay, that's fine.  He likes that.  Anthony won't let him.  I don't want to be touched or rubbed.  He's afraid of his feelings.  I don't get touched or rubbed by anybody that's, I would say, probably 30 years or older.  At least he's honest.  Yeah, you are being honest.  That's it.  Put your bags down.  What are you doing?  Look at those pants.  You're in the spot of honor.  Put your stuff down.  What's in the TGIF bag?  Oh, it's just some stuff that maybe this person that's coming in will be interested 
[00:08:00]  in buying.  You know, two things.  Oh, we have...  He might not.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, you have some stuff for the Pawn Stars guy.  We asked her to bring in a couple valuable things today, Colin.  Oh, no.  Rick Harrison is going to be...  I was thinking, like, what can I bring in?  I told her yesterday that he only carries $100,000 cash on him.  Right.  So that's as high as he'll be able to buy any.  Yeah, but he spends...  He's known to spend this guy.  Oh, yeah.  So you brought two valuable things in?  Well, yeah, they're sort of valuable, yeah.  All right.  That's good.  Before we go there, though, what happened after the show yesterday? 
[00:08:30]  You went right home?  I went right home.  And then what happened?  You have a few natty ices?  I had a few natty ices.  How many?  A few, I would say three.  Then I took a nap, you know, and...  Hard days at work.  Yeah, you're up early.  Well, hey, getting up at three, a quarter to four in the morning.  That's true.  That is a hard thing to do.  Especially when you're not used to it.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  And...  Got up from your nap, and then what?  Well, I had no choice. 
[00:09:00]  Because I was trying to read the stuff on my little smartphone, and all of a sudden,  my eyes just started to go like that.  I said, let me take a nap.  Oh, yeah.  Smart phone.  I mean, that's a smartphone that I have.  Diana was always the smart one.  Yeah.  Well, that's what a smartphone does.  It's pretty smart.  How long did you sleep for?  Oh, she loves massaging Carl's back.  Thanks.  Thanks, honey.  Look at this.  She is all over, Carl.  Of course.  You getting wet, or is that diarrhea?  This intern thing, does it really start to pay off? 
[00:09:30]  What kind of a question is that?  Sorry.  That was a bad question.  Yeah.  You're sea-blocking her.  She's trying to make the moves here.  I heard you already made...  Take that picture off.  Yeah.  I don't like that picture.  Which one?  Take it off, Sam.  You heard it.  I was a little red in the face and everything like that.  Hold on.  It's a factual picture.  There's no way you can...  Which one doesn't she like?  I don't like it.  She doesn't like the way it should be...  I like the fact that she gave Sam an audit.  Take that picture off.  That's what...  Sam, do it, bitch.  That's the picture when you were homeless, though.  I know.  I know what it is.  I don't like it.  It brings back bad memories. 
[00:10:00]  That should be inspiration.  We like your cute Winona Ryder thing.  That is.  To be fair, except for the middle, they're all quite bad pictures.  Oh.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That was when you were taking it in the shitter.  That's what got you fired from scorch.  Yeah.  That middle picture was when you were taking it in the ass by your...  No, that was even younger.  It looks like a high school shot.  Yeah, it does.  Oh, wow.  That's that jacket.  When were you playing Rump Invaders after work?  When were you having anal sex?  Which one of those pictures is you in the 80s? 
[00:10:30]  The one in the middle.  Oh, that is you.  Okay.  Oh, man.  I didn't think of it.  I was saying correctly.  No, no, no.  I knew it was you, but I didn't know if that was the time that that was taken.  Man.  I would believe it was around that time, yeah.  Hanging out with that fast crowd smoking cigarettes in the back hall?  Oh, no.  I did not start smoking until I started to get evicted from my apartment in Westfield.  What year was that?  Her phone.  Why is your phone?  Her phone again.  It's the Westfield Chamber of Commerce.  Please don't address it.  Don't mention our fair city. 
[00:11:00]  Look how long it takes for her to answer the phone.  Answer it.  Yeah, it's a whole thing, Dye.  You've got to do it quick then.  Jesus.  Who is it?  Hello.  Private number again.  Hold on.  Let me shut it off.  There you go.  All right.  Well, maybe Marion's going to call in.  Day four, she thinks that.  I'd like to rebake All in the Family with me and Lady Dye.  You said her as Archie.  You know, she's listening right now.  You know, she works.  How many times have you gone down to Starbucks so far? 
[00:11:30]  I heard once.  What?  Once, twice?  Yeah, one time today.  And that's why I want to talk to that guy in the corner.  Our young intern.  What's your name, sir?  Adrian.  Adrian has been Lady Dye's chaperone for the last couple of days because she's not allowed  to use bathrooms around here.  Yeah, it's been a delight.  And I heard that she took a pretty monstrous dump in Starbucks.  Yeah.  That's what it's for.  Well, you know.  Sorry to embarrass you in front of Colin Quinn.  No, is that embarrassing at all?  I bet they're used to that, though.  Everybody poops, right? 
[00:12:00]  I bet they're used to that, though, with the coffee and stuff.  A lot of people probably sit there, drink their coffee, and they're like, oh, boy.  Is there anyone in this world who's not cast the first stone for you to do this?  I'm a Starbucks.  They can't even know you're going to the bathroom.  So what happened in Starbucks?  I was standing about 10, 15 feet away.  From the bathroom?  Most of it, clearly.  A lot of splashing.  A lot of splashing sounds.  I heard a lot of grunting.  The Starbucks staff was a bit concerned.  Wanted to know if she was all right.  Are you serious?  Yes. 
[00:12:30]  While they were making cappuccinos, they heard some of it was audible to them.  What was audible?  Just the splashing.  You took a loud dump in Starbucks.  It could have been the machines.  I don't want to know if you died, but.  Yeah.  From outside?  I couldn't be happier.  What else?  And the hand dryer went off five, six times.  Each time we've gone down there.  Cleanliness is next to Godly, about keeping her hands dry.  Oh, yeah.  I'm very particular about everything.  Hold on.  The microphone, sweet.  Hold on. 
[00:13:00]  Talk to the microphone.  I'm very particular about everything.  You puke in.  I'm very particular about everything I do.  No, you're not.  You puke.  Well, I guess in a way, maybe.  She only pukes in sleep.  Yeah, but they're all gross things.  Right, right, right.  I was doing the camera of Adrian standing there.  Don't even ask me why I'm doing that.  Stoically for 15 minutes.  I just do that.  Like a Buckingham Palace guard.  What?  You wear underwear with shit in it.  Oh.  Like how?  What do you mean you wash your hands?  This is our guest, Sam.  Don't embarrass her in front of Colin Quinn.  She's trying to score a little CQ dick. 
[00:13:30]  Are you wearing dyedies today?  No, no.  I didn't have to wear them today.  You didn't have to?  Besides that, that was my last pair anyway.  Ah, okay.  All right.  Just had one for emergencies.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, that was an emergency.  I'm going to tell you that right now.  Well, you've cleaned up very nicely the past few couple of days.  Yeah.  This is a good change because you were, you know, it looked pretty grim those first few days.  We've got to start looking into the future.  You've got to update the resume.  Now you've got a week on ONA.  Then you head over to the dollar store with a new attitude.  I told you guys this yesterday.  That's babbles. 
[00:14:00]  Every time I drink tap beer, it goes right through you.  Oh, tap beer.  Because they don't clean the lights.  Right.  I made that mistake twice this week.  What about, but, oh, so you still drink the Canzanati.  Yeah, but that's, you know, that's cans, and I'm at home anyway, so if I have to go, I go.  It's TGIF.  Yeah, you should.  Wait, so they don't clean the lines.  What's that mean?  They don't clean the lines.  I don't know, but my uncle used to be a lines cleaner.  You've got to flush out those lines.  Oh, yeah.  Some sediment or whatever gets in there.  A lot of times, yeah, the distance between the actual keg. 
[00:14:30]  I mean, you're in a lawsuit against TGI Fridays for making you sick.  The distance between the keg and the tap is a long way.  And it's not refrigerated, and it's just sitting in the line, so the next beer you pull isn't  from the keg.  It's from that line that's been sitting there maybe overnight, and it's hot.  It's not insulated.  Well, how would I know that?  I went to two TGIFs in Penn Station.  You sued TGIFs in general, the whole corporation.  That's right.  I'm just saying.  I see a lawsuit.  There you go.  She loves TGIF.  Oh, she loves it. 
[00:15:00]  Marty, do you ever have the artichoke and spinach dip there?  Wait a minute.  That's a good question.  That's phenomenal.  That's a good question.  But, no, I never did.  Just suddenly craving it.  Yeah, that's good stuff.  I remember that the one TGIFs used to be a Houlihan's.  I remember Houlihan's.  Okay?  Remember Houlihan's?  Yes, I remember Houlihan's.  Sure I do.  Oh, yeah.  Remember Beefsteak Charlie's?  Yes.  Unlimited beer and sink.  Sure, I remember it.  It was named after her.  They had the best taco salad there ever at Houlihan's. 
[00:15:30]  Fascinating.  You're going to get spoiled.  We will treat you right.  You're going to get spoiled at Beefsteak Charlie's tonight.  Remember that?  Yeah, Beefsteak Charlie's.  I don't think I ever went there.  Hey, Lady Di, put headphones on.  We got Dr. Steve on the phone.  Hold on.  Give our honored guests the headphones.  Sam, please.  Dr. Steve is getting me involved now with this whole thing.  Give this young lady headphones.  Jesus.  Yeah, Di?  Dr. Steve, welcome to the show, sir. 
[00:16:00]  Hi, Di.  Good morning.  Good morning.  We had some conversations yesterday afternoon, didn't we?  Yes, we did.  So, Lady Di's in studio and the great Colin Quinn.  Okay.  Oh, hello, Colin.  Hello, Colin.  So, walk us through what happened yesterday.  Well, after your show, I called Diana at home.  Oh.  And I was going to fly up, and we were going to have a fun little bit on Friday.  But I didn't want to do it unless there was going to be some payoff for her. 
[00:16:30]  And so, she and I discussed it.  And Diana, it's okay that we talk about this, right?  Sure.  Okay.  Go ahead.  There you go.  So, we discussed that it was obvious that she wasn't interested in going to rehab because  it's, you know, the problems that she has is the tap beer or she had Norwalk virus, which  by the way, if her theory that she had a puke bug is true, then we'll know soon enough because  all of you guys are going to be puking and shitting in a few days. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Colin loves that.  We'll know if that theory is right.  Would she be happier if she gave us a puke bug and we were all puking and shitting and  I had to cancel a gig?  Oh, man.  Colin is so excited.  I imagine.  This is a great day for you, isn't it, Colin?  Yeah, I'm going to ask I get it, too.  Of course, if it's the alcoholism, it will just continue to happen.  But it hasn't happened now in two days. 
[00:17:30]  Right, right, right.  Probably because she got some beer in her, maybe.  Yeah, maybe so.  So, well, here's the thing.  Will you listen to Dr. Steve?  Oh, my God.  I heard a question.  What are you saying?  She's just rambling over Dr. Steve talking.  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  She's yelling at Sam.  Yeah, she's just yelling at Sam.  I wanted to write something down.  You look like Jim Florentine's brother.  I don't even know what Jim Florentine looks like.  I know, but in the mouth, he looks exactly like you. 
[00:18:00]  Seriously?  Yeah.  Yeah, his brother looks exactly like, his brother Danny looks exactly like Lady Di.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Looks like me.  Yeah.  He's thrilled.  All right, go ahead, Dr. Steve.  So, we talked for quite a while, and, you know, there's a significant amount of denial there.  I told Di that the swelling in her abdomen could be a sign of a condition called ascites,  which is where fluid kind of weeps off of the liver and fills up the abdomen with fluid. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, weeps off the liver?  Yes, and one of the reasons why she's never hungry could be because she's got fluid in  her abdomen that's pressing on her stomach, and so she gets full early.  Oh.  And so that contributes to the malnourishment.  We should just stick a tap in there, then.  Right.  You know, I do take vitamins, Dr. Steve.  I do take vitamins. 
[00:19:00]  Well, she takes vitamins.  Yeah, hold on a second.  It's not like I'm, you know, malnourished, malnourished.  Hearing you say that is like somebody walking through, like, Hiroshima with a broom.  And I take my thyroid medication, too.  Ah, you should.  That's good.  That's good.  That'll help.  But you're in terrible denial.  Well, there you go.  Continue, Dr. Steve.  So, I talked to Di for quite a while, and she does not have a primary care provider, but  she does have insurance, and so we couldn't negotiate a trip to rehab, but we did negotiate 
[00:19:30]  her allowing me to send her a lab slip so we could just do some liver function tests and  a complete blood count, and I ordered a thyroid test just to see where we're at with all of  that stuff.  And then if it's horrendous enough, I can actually arrange for her to have follow-up with  the doctor local to her, and I can get her in quickly if her lab tests are bad enough, 
[00:20:00]  and I can get her in anyway, but she's got to have a motivation to go, and I hope the  blood work may help.  And then the other thing is, it was clear talking to her, because the whole time I was  talking to her, Bill was in the background yelling, you need to go to rehab.  Oh, Jesus.  As he's drinking his 30-pack, by the way.  I believe it, Di.  He was.  He was yelling, he was yelling, and I'm like, shut up.  Right.  I can't tell him to shut up.  I'm on the phone with Dr. Steve. 
[00:20:30]  But if Bill's telling you that, I mean, come on, Bill's a heavy drinker.  For him to be telling you, you need to go to rehab.  Well, you know what?  Let me tell you something right now.  Okay.  All right.  He was drinking his Coors, and you know, whenever he has a few drinks inside of him, he starts  yelling and screaming.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  That's good.  Oh, no.  No, it ain't good, because I have to live with him.  Cops.  Jesus, with Bill in the background yelling.  Oh, it's just a bad scene.  But, Lady Di, I know you lie. 
[00:21:00]  You lie a lot about following through with things.  That's true.  Now, Dr. Steve is doing a lot of things that are for your own good.  Right.  That's it.  Out of the kindness of his heart.  Right.  And you have to follow up and follow through with these things.  All right.  But, no, you say all right all the time about everything, and then you don't do it.  Yes, as to death.  This is very important.  When are you going to get these tests done?  Whenever the papers come.  What we need to do is, well, the first test, of course, is if she has the blood work done.  Right.  And I'll follow through on that.  But it became quite obvious through this that what she needs is an intervention. 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  Because us talking about this stuff, it's just because, you know, she said, well, I'll think about it.  I'll think about it, which is, you know, just a way to get me off the phone, kind of.  You know, we had a very nice conversation.  We have, I think, all come to really care about Diana this week.  Slow down.  Yeah.  You know.  Thank you very much.  The thing is, the people who care about her need to be in a room and tell her what the consequences are if she doesn't go to rehab and there need to be real consequences. 
[00:22:00]  If she doesn't go to rehab, she can't be on our show anymore.  There you go.  I did my part.  Well, that would be your consequences.  There you go.  Bill might have another one, and her son may have another one, and Mary.  Bill might have one.  Dr. Steve sounds like Sosa.  Yes.  Yes.  I'll tell you the consequences.  Yes.  I told you a long time ago, that'll fuck me die. 
[00:22:30]  Dr. Steve, let me ask you this.  If she doesn't do anything, right, and continues on her way here.  On her merry way.  On her merry way.  Yes.  What do you see happening to her?  Well, what will happen, and I've seen this a million times, is there will be denial, denial, denial until there is a catastrophic event.  You know, Bill comes in and finds her unconscious and can't wake her up and calls 911, and she ends up in the hospital.  Oh, boy. 
[00:23:00]  And that's when the process can start.  Now, some people can survive that and actually have a, it's a wake-up call for them, and they go through detox and rehab, and they actually do okay.  And then some people, which are, you know, also, I'd say it's about 50-50, if that.  It might be 20-80, they will, you know, go through the hospitalization and, like Tippy Tom, go right back into their old ways again.  How long before this catastrophic event? 
[00:23:30]  That's difficult to say.  That's kind of between her and her creator at this point.  But educate her.  Educate her.  I can study.  All right, Anthony.  It's all right, Jim.  It's okay.  Oh, my God.  That was gold. 
[00:24:00]  Dr. Steve, you're a doctor, though, so an educated guess from a doctor.  Well, I can say sooner rather than later.  Sooner meaning what?  Within the next year?  Yeah, I'd say, you know, months, several months to a year, maybe, if she keeps going the way she's going.  But that's difficult to say.  Let her die, some major shit might happen within the year.  Different resilience.  Now, I can tell you, based on the blood work, a better prognosis once I see how, you know, if things have started down a certain path. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  You know, if I see elevated liver tests, grossly decreased protein level in her blood, that would tell me a lot.  Based on, like, visual, like, even just looking at her pictures, did you see that collage?  Yeah.  Of her through the years.  That last picture, the most recent one, what do you see there as far as alcoholism goes?  Well, I see a condition called rhinophyma.  Oh, what is that? 
[00:25:00]  That's the enlarged nose that she's got.  And that is a, I'd have to see it in person.  The W.C. Fields.  The W.C. Fields, right.  The W.C. Fields nose.  Okay.  And what that is, is a condition where you get rosacea of the nose, and it's untreated, and then, for some reason, it's exacerbated by alcoholism.  Wow.  Jeez.  I see some...  Wait, wait.  Lady Di, in denial again, is staring at the picture and goes, I don't see it. 
[00:25:30]  She goes, I don't see it.  I don't see the nose.  You don't see it because you're not a doctor.  Yeah, well...  You have a nose like Dagwood Bumstead's boss.  Wow.  Bravo.  I see I'm in need of a haircut, that's for sure.  Good point.  That's it.  That starts from the...  A haircut and some clean beer taps.  Let's hope Jack Torrance comes and can cut it for you.  This goes back to the denial thing that we're all talking about here.  Like, that's all she sees in that picture, that she needs a haircut. 
[00:26:00]  Needs a haircut.  Dr. Steve.  And I need to lose some weight, yes.  Oh.  But you might not be able to lose the weight because it's advanced liver disease.  Yeah, you don't lose weight by quitting drinking.  Weeping off your liver.  You don't eat, so the weight's not from that.  Yeah, you don't eat, right?  Dr. Steve, can I ask you one question?  When you graduated medical school, that day you got that diploma, and the whole family  is surrounding you, and you're all cheering, you got your little hat, your cap, and after  all these years, all the loans, did you ever envision yourself on the phone yesterday 
[00:26:30]  talking to a disgruntled ex-dollar store employee, while an angry former Golden Gloves champion  falling on hard times is yelling in the background.  He's yelling in the background.  Yeah, my mom would be very proud.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  He's tossing his hat up in the air.  Fast forward.  Oh, the future is his.  My life is just starting, Ma.  That's it.  Too good. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  And so you were saying, and her face looks, what, bloated, right?  It does look bloated, but I'd have to look at the whole person.  Now, the pictures that alarmed me the most were the ones of her abdomen, when she said,  well, it just keeps getting bigger.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know why, because I don't eat anything.  Yeah.  And that's what makes me concerned about.  It's called Fred Mertzism.  Come on.  I'm sorry.  Hey, there was another question. 
[00:27:30]  What the fuck?  With her stomach.  What's out?  Oh, shoot.  What was it?  Oh, man.  What did you eat?  You're eating a donut?  What's that?  Hot sauce?  No, no.  It's a bagel and cream cheese.  Hot sauce?  Oh.  Yeah.  Spices it up?  No, I just...  Dr. Steve, the...  She wants to be close to the call.  She loves her call.  She needs some effect.  Yeah.  What do you got to say about the diarrhea and her peeing herself and stuff?  As she's wrapped around Colin.  Exactly.  I'm like this. 
[00:28:00]  As she laughs.  It was an accident.  That's what it was.  No one thought it was on purpose, dear.  No.  No.  Okay.  You got adult diapers on today?  No.  No.  No.  She used the last one.  All right.  She used the last one.  Well, I used the last one, but I don't think I need them today.  Good for you.  And I think the thing that we've missed...  You got to roll the dice sometimes.  Right.  The point that we've missed about the adult diapers is that...  I'm still waiting for a date, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on, okay?  Oh, boy.  Hold on, Dr. Steve.  While you're trying to save her life, she's trying to fuck Colin.  Right. 
[00:28:30]  So, yes, Dr. Steve, you were saying...  Well, I think the point that we've missed on this with the adult diapers is that she used  her last one yesterday.  They come in packs of 20.  Oh.  So, that means that she'd used 19 before.  Ah.  Have you had...  Poor Diana.  Huh?  How do you have those?  You've used 20 of them?  Of course I did.  I mean, I had that adult diaper for a long time.  And I said, if anything, I need it today. 
[00:29:00]  So, if she's shitting herself...  Why did she need it before?  Yeah.  So, that tells me that it's not an acute problem.  This is a chronic problem.  Right.  You can say that again.  A what problem?  It's a chronic problem.  Chronic problem.  An acute problem.  Wait a minute.  So, that leads us into a whole different set of diagnoses.  Yeah.  You know, chronic diarrhea can be caused by malabsorption, which can be caused by pancreatic  problems.  Uh-oh. 
[00:29:30]  It can be caused just by irritable bowel syndrome, but that's an extreme problem.  Listen, Dr. Steve.  Oh, there we go.  I remember now.  Oh.  All right?  I'm in menopause.  I'm going through menopause.  Right.  Yes.  And I used to get my period every six months.  Uh-huh.  All right?  Okay.  Every six months?  Until...  Until...  What?  You're an elephant?  You're a psychotic.  No, that's what happens.  Yeah.  To answer Obie's question, yes.  She is.  I was getting my friend every six months.  Your friend.  Yeah.  Whatever you want to call it. 
[00:30:00]  Okay.  That's a long-distance friend.  You know what I mean.  Yeah.  The curse.  And I bought adult diapers because it was pretty bad.  Like, you know, like...  Oh, you were really bleeding.  What's the matter?  No tampon?  But the whole...  More excuses, by the way.  No, no, no.  That's not an excuse.  That's serious.  If I can take it off, it looks like Lincoln's pillow.  Did you ever have to wrap a sheet around the fire plug while I go into the store and just  stand there and wait?  Because if I didn't do that, okay, I would stain the sheets and stuff like that. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, you should have that.  So...  But you continued to use them.  Yeah.  I would wear an adult diaper, especially when I went to bed because...  Period.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Every six months.  It's like the Palos joke.  It looks like the horse's head seems like I got that.  But it would feel like when it did, when it, you know, finally came, okay, it would come  a lot.  Uh-huh.  So finally...  We get it.  Finally, that is over with. 
[00:31:00]  Ah.  So I didn't need to do that.  So you're all the way through menopause?  I don't know.  Maybe.  I have no idea.  You don't get your period, right?  No, not at all.  Well, see?  Then she's done with menopause.  Not at all.  Good news for Colin Quinn.  He's not pregnant.  No, you can dump right in.  You can dump right in there.  Yes.  Don't need to pull out.  Just wrap your fucking hands around that back and fill her full of seed.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Anything else, Dr. Steve?  Colin?  Yeah, well then.  Yes.  It's a beautiful visual. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yes.  It's a careful visual.  All right.  What about her weeping flow?  If she wasn't using those for piss and shit, then it's...  Paul, easy with the medical terminology.  Dr. Wiseguy.  It is more likely than that the first few days she was going through acute withdrawal.  Yeah, right?  That was our original theory.  Well, Dr. Steve, what about the psychological stress of starting a new job? 
[00:32:00]  Man, it affects all of us.  Absolutely.  I used to get his tummy ache the first day of school.  I remember that.  There you go.  Yeah.  It's probably the same thing.  Stuff like that happens.  Just keep enabling her.  Keep enabling.  We just wanted to get some good radio.  You're not enabling me.  So, anyway, there you go.  So, what we're going to do, Di and I are going to follow up.  I'm going to keep talking to her.  If we have a miracle and she agrees to go to rehab, we'll have it all set up.  Dr. Lydia is going to help us with this. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, nice.  She's licensed to do an intervention in New York.  She's licensed to have giant tits.  Yeah, that's right.  We all know that.  She's got some big ones.  That's right.  She's licensed to milk a load.  But other than that, she can help out with the psychological aspect of the whole thing.  We're going to set that up, and maybe within the next month we'll try to get that going.  All right.  That would be nice.  A little Di intervention.  Once again, when Dr. Lydia threw her cap in the air, did she imagine you animals would 
[00:33:00]  be saying, you should milk a load?  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  All right.  I don't know.  I forget if we went over this yesterday.  But did I tell you why I started drinking?  No, you did not.  Okay.  Low self-esteem.  Oh.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Because the guys that I used to like were either had another girlfriend.  Gay or unavailable.  Or unavailable. 
[00:33:30]  Or unavailable.  Gay or...  Right?  All right.  Or they just didn't want to go out with me.  Uh-huh.  Well, welcome to Earth.  Thus, you know, everyone would be drinking.  Everyone would be drinking.  We all have our, you know, unrequited loves.  Right.  But I think that was the reason why.  That's right.  And you started drinking.  It started.  It started like that.  All right, Diana.  Love self-esteem.  Love self-esteem.  That explains giving up the asshole for the entire...  That's right.  Yeah, that is true.  I guess it does.  I don't know.  That's right.  All through Reagan.  You're giving up the final shitter.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  You didn't feel worthy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't want to, but I did it.  You know.  Lady and I pull down the back of those bloomers.  I love when you do the Ronald Reagan.  Oh, who does it?  Isn't it great?  It's a national treasure.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  You should bury this treasure.  That's a good one, Shilpa.  So you start drinking because of that, and then it just escalated.  Yeah, it just kept on going on and on.  First, I started on the weekends.  Right.  Then I started after work. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  All right.  And then it just went on and on and on.  What about the guy that killed himself with the train?  Did that have an effect on your drinking?  No.  No.  Really?  No, it didn't.  She didn't care about him.  I wasn't with him.  I wasn't with him at the time.  At all.  I broke up with him.  She made the classic error that a lot of people make, that she used to drink the hard  stuff, and she figured, well, if I drink beer.  Yes.  Right.  There you go.  This is what beer drinking does to you.  Well.  Yeah, it's the same thing.  Yeah.  It's not just a beer belly, I think. 
[00:35:00]  We keep trying to tell you it's not just a beer belly.  A weeping fluid.  Yeah, your fluid's filling you.  It's a sack.  I don't know.  Why are you so afraid of going to rehab?  Why don't you just go and quit?  Aren't you done with it?  You should just go to rehab.  What are you holding on to that nonsense for?  Yeah.  I'm thinking.  I'm thinking right now.  It's like, yeah.  What is so good about your life right now that you don't want to change it through rehab  or trying to improve yourself? 
[00:35:30]  This is something that Dr. Steve and I are going to have to talk about.  Well, no.  I mean, it's just a question I'm asking you.  Look at your life right now.  Look at where you are in life.  Look at where you were.  Look at where you are right now.  What's so good about what you're doing right now in life that you don't want to mess it  up by going to rehab or self-improvement?  I really don't know.  There's nothing.  Right.  Okay.  Well.  You sit at home.  You watch horrible television.  You drink beer with an abusive man.  And that's your life.  He's not physically abusive. 
[00:36:00]  But whatever.  But you understand his point.  Whatever.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, it's not like you're like a rock star on tour doing drugs and drinking and  going, oh, you got to go to rehab.  It's like, wow, I'm fucking on tour.  I'm a rock star.  You're fucking living like, hey, look at you.  Yeah.  Come on.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  We got Dr. Lydia that wants him to.  Dr. Steve's on the phone.  And now we got Lydia.  We also have Colin Quinn in the studio.  What's up, Lydia?  Hi, guys.  Oh, my gosh. 
[00:36:30]  Hello, lovely.  And say that this is not what I imagined when I threw my cap up in the air.  What?  Who's that?  Dr. Lydia.  However, I do appreciate the forum.  And my heart really does go out to Diana, although it's very frustrating to work with substance  abusers and alcoholics.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Because it's very hard for them to stop.  And I do understand that.  Well, because you're.  Thank you.  You're leaning toward alcoholism yourself. 
[00:37:00]  No, because I do drink and I do understand substance abuse and I have seen it ruin people's  lives and maintaining a balance is very difficult.  Oh, no.  Lydia's not going to be good for Di.  Di's going to go like, I like to drink once in a while.  Lydia's going to go, here's to it.  He goes, once in a while.  That's fine.  Who is this?  Dr. Lydia.  You know, where are you from?  You know, who is this?  Yes. 
[00:37:30]  She's working on ground.  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  What do you do?  Ladies and guys.  Thank you so much for having me.  I'm celebrating a birthday.  Generally, when I work with people, I don't talk too much about myself.  I talk more about them.  There you go.  I am very, very concerned about you.  I'm glad that you recognize where your drinking started.  My guess is that it continues.  I know that's where it started.  It continues because of that, but also because of what Dr. Steve and the guys are saying 
[00:38:00]  there's now a physiological addiction that makes you ill when you don't drink.  And that's a big, big problem.  You're at a point where you really do have to make a decision about whether you're going  to live or die.  Damn.  Now that's serious right there.  That just got serious, Lady Di.  You're only 52.  It's not like you're in your late 80s.  You're 52 years old.  Yeah, 52.  53, 54, 55.  And you got a baby face underneath that, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:38:30]  You do.  Little cherub cheeks.  That is so nice.  Like a little John Panette.  That is so nice.  Thank you, honey.  See, Anthony, you don't know what you're missing.  Yeah.  Kiss to the floor.  You just kissed Colin's forehead.  Anthony, you don't know what you're missing, baby.  I know.  You know, seeing this now, it's making me a little jealous, Carl.  Oh, what is she doing?  Okay, yeah.  Wow, she's trying to get a little close to your mouth there.  Absolutely.  Di wants a little bit.  You're going to get that puke bug. 
[00:39:00]  How long is Colin going to fucking tease that little, that cooter before he gives a little  bit of...  I don't know, I better do some heavy training, I've got to match his face up to Bill.  I know they're not doing it anymore, but there's still something there.  I think so, too.  I think Bill will be jealous.  You feel it get all wet and find out it's just weeping liver juice?  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, that's not true.  Weeping liver juice.  Now we understand the smell from the other day. 
[00:39:30]  Ah, weeping liver juice.  That E-Rock smell than the rest of the guys.  Yeah, that was bad news.  I know, that was a good one, that video.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve, what else?  Are we done?  Yeah, if...  Can we move on with the funny?  I've heard Diana that if, by some miracle, she makes the decision to go to rehab, we can  have that done that day.  Oh.  See?  I'll keep in touch with her in the meantime, and if we need to do this intervention,  then we will.  Colin, don't forget to call me one day, okay?  She's not listening to you.  She's too busy giving Colin her number. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  I got the digits.  Good luck with this one, Dr. Steve.  Why don't you trade numbers?  How come only you're giving...  Why don't you have trade numbers?  I'll leave mine on your machine.  What machine?  Is she right here?  I'll leave it on the phone.  You should probably.  Just send her a text real quick.  Okay.  All right.  He can do that.  Yes, yes, Lydia?  Thank you, Anthony.  I wanted to thank Dr. Steve for reaching out and asking me if I could be involved, because  I would very much like to help Diana.  I know that Dr. Steve is working very hard. 
[00:40:30]  Diana, only you can make this decision, but if you would like some psychological support,  I'd be more than happy to give that to you.  Dr. Lydia, two top doctors are trying to help her, and she's yapping to Sam.  She's talking to Sam.  Diana, you're a psychotic.  She's yapping to Sam about taking down one of her pictures.  I think I know why Opie's making that face.  Because you're not listening.  A, you're not listening, and B, Lydia's accepting an award for some reason.  I want to thank Dr. Steve for informing me of this decision. 
[00:41:00]  Why do you feel this way?  Anthony, you should not act in this manner.  She's right.  I still say...  I would predict that Diana probably won't do anything until the situation worsens, because  she is living in an enabling situation.  That's true.  Ah, an enabling situation.  What enabling?  Bill's yelling about her to go to rehab, too.  That's true.  I mean, he's had it.  Yeah.  Bill is telling me to go to rehab.  But he's buying beers for you.  Man, Bill is telling me to go to rehab. 
[00:41:30]  What is it?  He'll buy, you'll fly kind of a thing?  I have no idea what it is.  I used to love those.  Hey, I'll buy, you fly.  I don't think he realizes, you know.  I don't think he realizes.  What?  Boy, if any house should have fucking reality show cameras in it, it's the lady died, Bill  house.  Why should he realize he's got his own personal horrors to deal with every day?  What, Lydia?  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  I didn't talk to him all day yesterday.  Good for you.  As soon as I got home, he said, don't have too many beers, don't get drunk, because you're 
[00:42:00]  going to have to go back out again.  He's not concerned with you.  You're just the fucking liquor fetcher.  Why did you have to go back out?  Oh, I know.  I have to take money out of this card to pay the rent, but I didn't go.  I did not go.  You had to nap.  He gives you his debit card and PIN number?  And he didn't say, don't drink.  He just said, don't drink too many beers.  Too many beers.  Right.  Don't forget, Bill's in that world, too, though.  He doesn't know.  Yeah.  Bill's idea of help is, hey, just slow down.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Well, actually, that's what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyhow, I'm going to get going, guys.  All right, Lydia.  All right, Lydia.  I'm going on in the studio.  Thank you, Lydia.  You know where to reach me.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Good luck.  We have two top medical people willing to help you.  There it is.  That's true.  What about Sam?  She's kvetching over there with Sam about something.  She has a medical team behind her now.  You have a team helping you for free.  Yeah, look at this.  And you're over there smiling and flirting and trying to get some dick.  You're trying to get some dick.  I'm trying to get his whole body.  Batting your leaky eyes at Colin. 
[00:43:00]  That's true.  Wow.  That's true.  Not just the one area.  Sam.  What would you do with Colin Quinn?  We learned what you would do with Anthony.  What would you do with Colin Quinn?  Same thing.  The same thing.  I don't remember what.  Yeah, walk us through it.  Kiss down his whole body.  She said to Anthony.  Kiss down his whole body from him.  I like the sexual part where you go, I might do that too.  She really does like cum.  Would you give him a massage?  If he was on his stomach, would you give him a nice massage?  Yes, I would.  And would you kiss his back a little bit?  Sure.  Maybe work your finger into his asshole? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, no.  I would that.  Nice.  She doesn't like ass play.  You know what?  I kind of agree with you, Diane.  I don't.  I wouldn't do that.  Yes, Dr. Steve.  Sorry to interrupt.  As much as I love...  Sexual fantasy.  And Colin would do...  All right, buddy.  All right.  Thank you.  Dr. Steve, I'll talk to you later.  Yeah.  Okay, I'll talk to you later.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, sorry.  Dr. Steve does so much for this radio show.  And fucking...  And they want to cut his $150 down. 
[00:44:00]  $150 down.  Carl, do you have a nice double door to sleep on with Lady Di?  Yes.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What happened?  What's up, Di?  Colin.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Tell them what you did, Di.  Tell them what you did.  The audience didn't see.  What?  I showed them my boobies.  Yeah, but why doesn't the liver...  Why doesn't the liver juice fill those things up?  I think they look pretty good.  No, no, no.  That's real tits.  Yeah.  That's all tit right there.  I'd say that's about...  I'm just saying God's cool if he's going to let the liver juice... 
[00:44:30]  They weren't that bad.  Those are about 34 C.  What'd you say?  It's 40 C.  What?  40 C.  That's right.  Maybe I should have let everybody guess.  I was pretty good.  That's all right.  That's all right.  We're fine.  40 C is nice.  Those are nice, big, heavy boobs.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hefty?  Want to touch them?  Yeah.  Those are real boobs.  You want to touch them?  No, I don't want to...  You sure?  You sure?  Fair question.  You sure?  Now you start, guy.  Start.  You sure?  Get him up a little bit.  Get him hard. 
[00:45:00]  Get out and squeeze it.  See how big it is.  You sure?  What?  Get him hard.  Get out and squeeze the fucking Puppet Master's cock.  He wants to ruin this radio show.  Give his cock a little squeeze.  I think it's only...  I think it's only fair.  He's rubbing his leg.  Yeah, what are you doing?  It's only fair.  This is called payback.  This is called payback.  How great would that be?  He starts this off to ruin us and he has to eat our ass. 
[00:45:30]  Hey, I would do anything for Colin if I did a free show out of him.  A free show?  A free show?  Yeah.  Private?  Go to one of your shows again.  Oh, yeah.  Private show.  Oh, that can happen.  Yeah, you don't mention the show when you're trying to get in his pants.  No, don't worry about that.  I don't know what show's going to be on next.  Now you just seem like one of the many groupies that follow him around.  We can set that up and we'll deal with whatever we're going to do afterwards.  Okay.  Back to me.  I saw you once at Caroline's and that was a long time ago.  Oh, yeah.  I believe you made your presents felt and I believe you also managed to know. 
[00:46:00]  Sure, she made her presents felt in the beginning of the show.  Oh, right.  No.  Before that, before that, when I had that Oliver Hardy haircut.  Oh, my God.  They have no clue.  Guys, remember that Oliver Hardy haircut I used to have?  Yes.  We do.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's around the time that I saw Colin Quinn.  All right.  Look, look, look.  We got to take a break and it's time for your makeover.  There you go.  Hey.  I'm getting made over.  I know.  All right.  That's not Oliver Hardy. 
[00:46:30]  I think that's more like, what's her name?  Oh, no, no, no.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  Well, maybe this one over here.  It's more like a hipster kind of Tegan and Sarah haircut.  Kind of.  Maybe that's hipster.  It's like Mary from The Little Rascal.  Good reference.  Nice.  If I could find the pictures at home.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We'll figure it out later.  Back in the 90s.  Okay.  All right.  The 90s?  Where were you taking it that decade?  Was that the decade of throat fucking?  She's a wild one.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to go to break. 
[00:47:00]  Colin Quinn is here.  Lady Di, go down the hall.  We're going to do a makeover.  And hopefully the makeover is done before Colin has to leave at around 8 o'clock.  Oh, it better be.  Sam, 40 minutes good enough?  I've got time.  All right.  Good.  So Lady Di is going down the hall.  I'm going to leave until the makeover is complete.  All right.  Good.  The doctor will be late rather than miss this makeover.  Exactly.  And I think we should give a call to Marion before she goes to work.  Oh, yeah.  We should.  Sam, get Marion on the phone if you can for after the break.  Hey.  I'll tell you, guys.  What's up, guys?  You don't understand. 
[00:47:30]  No other radio show would have been balls.  No.  No.  No.  Thank you, Colin.  Thank you, Colin.  Thank you for the recognition.  The commitment.  That we deserve.  Yes.  Oh, so much.  Commit.  We're trying to get Marion on the phone.  It's like, yeah.  We're doing it.  We have a shot.  All the way to Friday.  One more day after today.  I was like, ah, you guys should do it.  And I was like, ah, maybe I'm going to do it for a day.  No.  Now you guys are going right away.  The whole week.  Great.  Committing.  Yeah.  Now we've got makeup artists in the studio.  I know.  They're going to give Lady Di a little makeover.  A much-needed makeover. 
[00:48:00]  There you go.  Right?  I mean, natural beauty is one thing, but it's also good to spruce it up a little.  Enhance it a little.  Yeah.  Enhance the natural look.  By the way, there is major news.  They might have found that plane.  That's right.  Off, what, the coast of Australia?  That's why if you quit drinking, you'd blossom.  Your face would glow.  Yeah.  New video.  Possible plane parts spotted.  What, 1,500 miles from Perth?  Yeah, about 1,500 miles west or so of Perth, slightly south of that location. 
[00:48:30]  And I was listening to the news, and they were saying that last known turn that the plane  made and the satellite tracking.  If you take that position, make a straight line south like that, and then reach the end  of the range that the plane had, it would have been in this area that they kind of are seeing  some shenanigans.  So, ghost plane.  Could have been ghost plane.  Ghost plane.  Everyone either passed out or dead on the plane. 
[00:49:00]  I think right now...  Until they ran out of fuel.  The best scenario, or the most likely scenario is some type of fire inside the plane that  incapacitated the pilot, took out the tracking, the transponder, perhaps their communications,  so they couldn't radio anything, maybe depressurize the cabin.  Could have been catastrophic, but not to the point where the plane couldn't fly. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  And then everyone's dead, and the goddamn thing just flies until it runs out of gas and  crashes into the Indian Ocean.  That's my speculation.  Just like what happened with Payne Stewart.  That's not your speculation.  That's your new speculation.  That's my new speculation.  Your first speculation was the one that scared the shit out of everybody.  That was nuclear missiles were being loaded on the plane.  I bought into it hook, line, and sinker, too, like a fucking dope.  They deployed so many boats and planes and such that this is definitely the wreckage. 
[00:50:00]  They deployed a whole bunch just now.  I think it's 18 ships and helicopters and planes.  They're all going there now, so that means that they have no doubt that this is the wreckage.  I think they were saying that the measurements of this piece that they saw could be a piece  of the tail section stabilizer.  So, yeah, we'll see.  All right.  I think it's it, though. 
[00:50:30]  I think this is it.  I think it's it.  This is definitely it.  No?  You don't think it's it?  I'm going to stick by Anthony's earliest theory.  Oh, that is they're still loading it up.  There you go.  18 ships, 29 aircraft, and choppers deployed.  That means they know this is it.  It wants teeth.  Deploying all that to one one area.  Bursts.  Oh, there's choppers.  Choppers.  Oh, boy.  Ah, here we go.  Makeover has begun.  Yes, it has. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, we got a very special guest on the phone.  Oh, who?  Very special guest.  Who is our special guest?  Hello.  Who's our special guest on the phone?  Hello?  Hey, Elsie.  Hey, Anthony.  Hi, Colin.  Hi, Marion.  That hurt my ears.  Hey, Diana.  How's it going today?  Oh, she can't hear you right now.  She's being put in kiss makeup.  Yeah, she's having a makeover done.  She's having a makeover done, Jimmy.  What are you talking about? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, good.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, no, that's a little...  Colin.  It's okay.  It's all right.  Marion.  You look good.  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  I'm doing this for you, Colin.  I was with that one over there.  She can't hear you because she doesn't have headphones on.  Marion, I have to be...  I don't know what I'm...  Marion, I'll be honest with you.  I thought you gave a good tough love talk to her yesterday.  I was listening to the show.  Hey, I'm trying because, Colin, honestly...  Yeah? 
[00:52:00]  I know.  I know.  I know everything, and I know exactly what she's going through, and I'm not going to  say too much.  I know, but...  Just leave it at that.  But let's put it this way.  Even...  She has Dr. Steve and Dr. Lydia on the phone, willing to help her.  She's got to want to take the help.  Yeah.  But you know better than anybody, she's going to do what she's going to do.  Who's the doctor?  Who's Dr. Lydia?  Who's that?  She's a psychologist.  Oh.  Yeah.  But Dr. Steve...  Are they willing to come to the studio?  No, but they were willing to help in any way they could. 
[00:52:30]  They said, Dr. Steve's going to call her later.  Yeah.  But you know better than anybody, you can offer help, but you can't just...  Right?  Yeah.  What did she say?  Yeah.  She was kind of talking to Sam about some other stuff the whole time, so it was kind of a...  She seemed less focused than she needed to be, considering Dr. Steve was giving her time  and effort.  Well, she's a little starstruck, too, because Colin's in here.  Oh, yeah.  And the...  Yeah, I know.  She's madly in love with Colin.  I know that, but that wasn't pertinent to throw in while I was describing the scenario.  Colin, you go right ahead.  You know. 
[00:53:00]  You're at home.  You know what's going on.  You tell us.  Sure.  No, no.  I'd love to hear your opinion about it, since you weren't here.  What do we know?  We're just the idiots sitting here.  Go ahead.  Go.  It's all about you.  No, no, no, no.  You tell us.  It's a fun week with our...  Yeah, no.  We were just trying to give you the...  Yeah, right.  Okay.  Sure.  Marion.  Marion.  You go right ahead.  Continue.  What do you know that you keep saying, like, I know, I know.  What do you know?  I'm not saying, because it is personal to me. 
[00:53:30]  You have to say, because you're trying to help her.  No, because I don't want too much of this.  You know, one day I'm going to come up to the studio, and one day I'm going to talk to  you, and it's going to be off the air.  Yeah.  No dirty laundry on the air.  You're right.  But just...  Literally, in this case.  Think about it.  Marion is...  She needs help.  Marion needs help?  No, Diana needs help, but just think Marion knows what she's going on.  Yes.  But that's what I'm saying.  But it was a little frustrating, because Dr. Steve is right there. 
[00:54:00]  But, I mean, you're better than anyone, though.  You're trying to...  Oh, yeah.  Right?  You're trying to...  But the thing is, though, if you put somebody in the water, right, and people are going to  have anybody for 30 days...  Yes.  ...or 90 days, 60 days, whatever, when she comes out...  Right.  ...or anybody comes in, they can't go near a drink.  Excellent point.  Very salient.  That is the...  So they're going to have to give medication to people that need help with their drinking.  Well, they have that medication. 
[00:54:30]  And if he's willing to do that, fine.  Right.  But here's my point.  You can only watch it for so long, because then you're going to Florida at some point.  Well, I'm moving in about six or seven years.  Let's hear some more about that.  Six or seven.  What's that?  The plan is Florida?  My plan is to change.  Cool.  Where?  Where?  I don't know where.  I'll tell you where.  West Palm Beach is gorgeous.  I love it there.  But I'm going to tell you something.  I have relatives in Daytona.  I have relatives in Orlando.  Excellent.  I want to go... 
[00:55:00]  Daytona is better.  It's by the beach.  Orlando stinks.  But you know what?  That's...  I'm talking down the road.  I'm talking...  I know.  ...years and, you know...  Oh.  I know.  But I'm saying that if somebody's going to go to rehab, and if they come in, what's  to prevent them from not stopping in the bar or stopping...  Right.  Nothing prevents them unless they want to stop.  They have to have control.  Oh, you already knew the answer.  Why would you ask?  Now, Bill...  Glad to see you're answering your own questions.  Bill drinks, too.  Bill drinks, too. 
[00:55:30]  He does.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Well, then she can't live there.  Yeah.  Exactly.  No, she can live with you.  She'll have to live with you, Marion.  I have a husband.  Are you kidding me?  You got a spare room?  I got a lot of issues with him.  You got a spare room?  What kind of issues you got with your husband?  Yeah, what do you got?  Erection difficulties?  What's the issues with...  I don't have a spare room.  Sorry.  What's the issues with the husband?  Yeah, he can't continue...  He can't keep an erection?  Let's just leave it at that.  I have a husband.  It's done...  This is...  Leave it.  We know your husband.  Wait.  Yeah.  Is he trying to bring a black gentleman into the bedroom, and you object? 
[00:56:00]  Excuse me?  I'm going to hang up one of you.  If you don't stop.  Well, that's a fair question.  Yeah, that was a good question.  Relax.  Now, what are you guys doing?  I'm going to be on the pail today.  What?  Well, you tell us...  I want to know what you guys are doing to her.  A makeover.  Yeah, she's giving her a makeover today.  Give her a haircut.  Put some makeup on her.  Take her out shopping.  Hold on.  Let's put the makeup artist on with you, because she wasn't sure what to do.  Hold on.  Yeah.  How about Rosalia Bikini Wax?  Yes, you're here. 
[00:56:30]  And...  Hey, I want to ask you something.  Now, is Dr. Steve willing to come into the studio and talk to her face-to-face?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  Is that true?  It's a great question.  He said he's got...  He talked to her on the phone.  Now, is Dr. Lydia, is she willing to come to Diane face-to-face?  Yeah.  And where are they from?  How many questions would be before answers are given?  Where are they from?  Good point.  Well, you know Dr. Steve.  Yeah, he's from...  None of them, yeah.  But if she gets help... 
[00:57:00]  Does she want the answers to any of these questions?  No, no, no.  She just wants to ask questions.  She just wants to talk.  Where are they going to be?  In high school, were you a one-man band?  Well, they were going to set her...  I think they were going to...  They were talking about setting her up where they, you know, they go to the...  They call the hospital as a doctor, and then they say, look, you should recommend her  to be admitted because it is, you know?  I mean, they're going to take her to the hospital and just leave her there.  Dr. Steve...  No, but it's not leave her, but it's like a detox type of environment.  Dr. Steve is going to make sure she has medical testing done. 
[00:57:30]  And I think...  All right.  Why would she listen?  All right.  You have an...  I'm almost in awe of your ability to trample what people have said.  I've never seen anyone be able to do this on purpose, much less accidentally.  It's a gift.  It is a gift.  Yeah.  You've asked 12 questions.  We can't answer it.  I bet you she said no.  Correct.  Well, you know, she didn't exactly say no, but right. 
[00:58:00]  She was kind of avoiding it by talking to Sam the whole time.  Her and Sam had some little coffee clutch.  Exactly.  She was worried about it.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Guys, let it go.  I know.  You tried.  Go.  Maybe another time.  We could try again.  You're right.  Do you hold the phone in the wrong place when you're talking?  Yeah.  Is it upside down?  Do you hold the ear part against the bridge of your nose or your eye?  You said you were going to Virginia Beach to do a show.  When are you going?  Good question.  Well, thanks for the plug.  I'll be there tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday. 
[00:58:30]  Tickets available aplenty.  My cousin Mandy lives in Virginia Beach.  Cool.  More pertinent information.  I was wondering how we'd circle that back around and artfully done.  You never know.  You know, there could be some of my relatives in the studio.  Oh, boy.  If I hear yapping at the critical points and punchlines, I'll know.  I never know.  They could be related to me.  Oh, boy.  She doesn't laugh.  She doesn't listen.  She doesn't laugh.  It's all about Marion. 
[00:59:00]  No, it's literally a machine gun interrupting.  Yeah, what's the Caroline shows?  When?  Soon.  Yeah, I'll be at Caroline's in April.  Hold on.  At the end of April.  April what?  I was trying to tell you.  April 24th through the 27th.  Okay, maybe I'll go.  I would hope so.  Oh, my God.  How do you survive?  I would hope so.  We will both go.  All right, good.  Can we get Marion on a Lady Di in a microphone, Sam? 
[00:59:30]  She could get up from her makeover to have a little conversation with Marion.  Don't touch your face.  Or she could just sit there.  We'll give her headphones if we got anything.  All right, I got it.  All right, hold on.  Hold on a second, Di.  We're putting headphones on you.  Right.  Because you have to be able to hear.  Right.  The makeover's looking good, Lady Di.  You have to be able to hear.  Okay, thank you.  I can't see myself.  There we go.  Don't worry.  You'll see yourself in the end.  It's beautiful.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Marion, you're on with Lady Di. 
[01:00:00]  Hi.  Yeah, Diana.  Hi.  What happened with this Dr. Steve?  Oh, we were talking yesterday.  Oh, no.  Today.  This is great.  Did he call you today?  We're trying to stay still for this makeover.  All right.  What do they do?  What kind of makeover do you have?  You know, just a regular makeover.  That's all.  Yeah, what kind?  What do you mean?  Do you have your hair, makeup?  Makeup.  Makeup.  Right now.  Oh, God.  All right. 
[01:00:30]  Make sure it's not too dark.  Oh, it's not too dark.  Too much blush, John.  No, it's almost kabuki-like him anyway.  They're professionals, man.  They're professionals.  They know what they're doing.  Call that, Diana.  Nothing from her.  Nothing.  No, no, no.  I don't know what you and this Dr. Steve and Dr. Lydia.  Are you going to go for that?  You know what?  When I get the paperwork, that's a decision that I'm going to have to make. 
[01:01:00]  Diana sounds like she's a little annoyed with Marion's meddling.  Yeah.  I'm trying to stay still.  You're going to have to make.  I think Diana's a little annoyed with your perceived meddling, Marion.  No, I'm trying to stay still.  She's annoyed.  Okay, we've been trying to help her for years.  Oh, yeah?  Okay, so...  Because you know things.  If she does it, she does it.  If she doesn't, well, you guys try it.  What do you know that you're not saying?  I'm just trying to stay still. 
[01:01:30]  That's all.  Okay, Marion.  I'm dying.  What do I know?  Yeah, say it.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Stop teasing us.  What are you doing?  We're a radio show.  We all know each other for 15 years.  What are you trying to get?  There's a lot of people that end up with all kind of liver disease, all kind of problems,  and they end up dying from throts for the liver.  And you know what?  I don't want to see that happen to Diana if she ends up getting it in a couple years.  I don't want to see that happen to anybody.  That's very helpful.  And she should go for help, but that's up to her. 
[01:02:00]  Diana, any comment on the words of wisdom?  When I get the paperwork, I will follow up on that.  Dr. Steve told me probably Saturday.  Okay.  Good.  You know what?  The thing is, you can't put too much pressure on somebody because if you put too much pressure  on somebody, they'll turn around and they'll say, forget it, fuck it, I won't do it.  You're 100% right.  At the same token, she's got you for a few more years, but what happens when you move to  FLA? 
[01:02:30]  Excuse me?  I'm saying what happens when you move.  That's years down the road.  If I decide to move five years from now, I can hit the lottery before that.  I don't know.  Wow.  Now you're talking.  From your mouth to everyone's fucking three years.  Yeah, so maybe your phone will be lost and then we'll feel like we hit the lottery.  So, Diana, this doctor's Steve.  He's going to send you some stuff in the mail.  Yes, he is.  He has my address. 
[01:03:00]  Marion wants to know about this Dr. Lydia.  She feels a little bit...  I don't even know who Dr. Lydia is.  And where are they from?  Are they from New York area?  You already asked that.  Where is Dr. Steve from?  Tennessee.  We already said that.  Exactly.  What do they root for in college?  Who cares?  Okay.  All right.  Well, Tennessee.  And Lydia's from Long Island.  Okay.  Well, Lydia's kind of close.  So, Lydia, maybe Lydia can help you.  Right.  On the psychiatric end.  Oh.  You know, maybe...  You really think so?  You think Dr. Lydia can help me? 
[01:03:30]  Maybe she can.  I don't know.  She'll give you her phone number.  Give her a phone number and give her a call.  It's not a bad idea.  Yeah, it's a good idea.  This is such a waste of a phone call.  No, she's getting...  They're really going back and forth and getting something done.  Right.  You've got to take the first step, okay?  Oh, that's a good idea.  That's true.  That's actually...  And the first step is a phone call.  And you see what that...  You take down...  First step is to get the number.  Yeah, second step is to get the number.  Yeah.  No, first you'll get the power. 
[01:04:00]  Then you'll get the woman.  This woman's going to stick her big tongue out to this guy.  Then you'll get the success.  I hear you, Marion.  I hear you.  Really?  He's got to stop fighting with you and downing you.  I mean, that's not fair.  Who's doing that?  Yeah.  Bill.  Bill fights with her all the time.  About what?  They're just roommates.  Everything that she does, Bill yells at her for.  Bill acts like she's 20 instead of...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, Bill's got problems, too. 
[01:04:30]  But Bill's got herself a hollering and screaming at her.  She's trying to do what she's good at.  She has been out putting applications in.  She has been out doing, you know, finding a look, looking for work.  Thank you, Marion.  For the fight, really.  If I see if I have wanted sign, I tell her.  It's raining.  Diana, this is hiring.  Go try it.  Listen to this.  Sounds like Bill's got anger issues, if you ask me.  Yeah.  Yeah, he does.  Bill has a lot of issues.  Anger issues?  He does have anger issues.  Yes, he does.  Yeah, Lady Di?  What is he so angry about? 
[01:05:00]  Hold on.  You know, I'm trying not to...  You could talk.  It could be frustrating, I guess, dealing sometimes with somebody who doesn't...  Yeah.  But he's got to deal with his own thing, too.  You know what?  You know what?  It's usually about money issues.  You should heal thyself, right?  It's money issues.  It's money.  It's wisdom.  Hold on the line.  I've got to go to Texas.  It's always money.  Hold on, Marion.  And Eric in Texas.  Go ahead.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Good morning.  Hello, Eric.  Thank you for the phone call.  Yeah, this Marion chick is just grating. 
[01:05:30]  Did anyone put anything else on?  She's just a fucking board.  Like, root canal with no fucking painkillers, man.  Wow.  Marion, comment?  Who?  A root canal?  I got my teeth on me.  What is he talking about?  You was talking about that, but you straightened him out.  I am on a cell phone.  You really should start mistyapoint.com and be the president and CEO and founder.  Mistyapoint. 
[01:06:00]  What is he talking about?  Does he know what he's talking about?  Yeah, he's a dentist.  He's concerned with your...  Tell him to go back to digging a fucking oil rig.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  He's from Texas.  Got him.  Got him.  Showed him.  Get back to digging your oil rig and put yourself in it, buddy.  Damn.  Locked oil rig.  That's rough.  She's getting tough since Bobby.  Let me go to Eric in Jersey.  Eric. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, it's just kind of getting a little boring already.  Boring?  I'm talking about something else.  If you think it's good, then don't listen.  I actually set it off for the first time in a year yet.  I'm following you something.  If you think me and Diana are good, honey, then don't listen.  If you want me to tell you something.  If you think you can go up to the show and do what me and Diana do, and I'm not even there.  I'm on the telephone.  Go for it.  Wow.  Love the confidence.  I'm serious.  Because me and Diana are a lot of fun together when we're up there. 
[01:07:00]  And when I'm not up there, I'm on the phone, and I'm so out of the box.  That's true.  That's true.  A lot of fun for you and a lot of misery for the listener.  All right.  Thank you.  Wow.  I get a lot.  Hey, me and Diana are getting a lot of views.  Believe me.  Let's go to Lisa in New Orleans.  You're on with Marion.  Good morning.  That was Mardi Gras.  That was a Mardi Gras celebration.  You know what, Marion?  I don't drink, but just listening to you makes me want to become an alcoholic.  I don't drink that much either, but it's not me. 
[01:07:30]  It's Diana with the lip balm.  President and CEO of Mr. Point.com.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  No, you shut up.  Good comeback.  If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all.  Ah, that's true.  Oh, dude, you're talking.  You want to hang up?  Oh, Jesus.  You are a fucking hypocrite.  And you're a fucking hypocrite.  You don't know me, so if I were you, I would shut the hell up, okay? 
[01:08:00]  You don't know anything about me.  Oh, my God.  Bye.  Let me say hi to Ken in Texas.  Ken, great calls coming in right now.  This is a lot of fun.  If I had a friend like her, I'd be a chronic alcoholic, too, man.  Well, good.  Go to the first bar you see and have a drink and keep drinking.  And I hope you're driving, and I hope you get into a car accident.  Why do you drink?  Here's the reason why I drink.  If you don't like it, if you don't like it, time to radio off. 
[01:08:30]  Hold on.  She's not.  Nobody said he has to listen to it.  Hey, guys, she's not the reason why I drink.  She's not the reason.  All right.  Mary, quit discouraging people not to listen to you.  Right.  Hey, I think we're, let me tell you something.  But I think we're doing a pretty good job.  Yeah.  If they don't like it, time to radio off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what you do.  That's what I say.  Thank you very much.  And Diane is doing good up there every day this week.  She's just going up on time.  Right.  She's doing a great job for us. 
[01:09:00]  Peter in Canada.  The first two days was a little different.  Peter in Canada.  Yes, Peter.  Marian, comment.  Peter.  Go ahead, Marian.  Peter.  God, Marian, do you even know you're talking over top of everyone?  Like, everyone tries to get a word in, and you just talk over top of everyone.  Sometimes that happens.  You know what?  You just did it again.  You just did it again.  Every time it happens.  Sometimes it happens.  Hey.  And when you're on a cell phone, it's hard.  You know, to hear. 
[01:09:30]  And it's hard to talk right on a cell phone.  Then open your ears.  All right.  Next caller.  Oh, she's done with you, Peter.  She's done with you.  Marian, I believe that he was saying that you trample everyone in kind of a narcissistic  blather.  Excuse me?  Shut up.  All right.  Hold on.  Big Al wants in.  He's a regular.  Big Al, go ahead.  Hey, you know, they got a term for people like Marian in the radio business.  It's called show killer. 
[01:10:00]  Get that bitch off the radio.  Play some Barry Manilow records or something.  Wow.  Shut up.  No, you shut up.  You think that you're fucking entertaining with Di.  Di is a sweetheart.  And she is funny.  Yeah, Diane is funny.  Yeah, I'll admit that.  She is.  And you're not.  You know what?  People have problems.  And if you don't think I'm funny, then hang the goddamn phone up, you moron.  Nobody thinks you're funny.  Nobody asks.  Nobody asks.  You don't make me want to go listen to the Catholic channel.  I'm not looking for your opinion, honey. 
[01:10:30]  So hang the phone up.  She's feisty today.  Fucking bitch.  Oh, sorry.  You don't know me, okay?  Ray in Philly.  Feisty.  Hey, man, why don't you just go suck a dick, you fucking horse-faced looking bitch?  You're getting tired of hearing you.  Shut the fuck up.  You don't know what I look like.  Eat a ball of eggs.  You nailed it.  Go back to your fucking hole.  Goodbye.  Shut up, you fuckbag.  Goodbye. 
[01:11:00]  That's a sucky dick.  Yeah, you know what?  Grow one.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  Fuck yeah.  Comebacks are flying.  No dick and no balls.  Oh.  Hey, guys.  Diana.  Oh, yeah.  She's listening.  I'm right here.  Okay, you're right there.  All right.  Hey, listen.  Let me go, okay?  Aw.  I got to get back, you know.  Yes.  And I'll give you a call later, all right?  I will.  All right.  Okay, I'll talk to you later.  Thanks, Opie.  Thanks for having to talk to you soon.  Oh, no problem.  All right.  Thanks. 
[01:11:30]  Bye, Jim.  You'll talk at us soon.  Exactly.  See you guys soon.  Okay, Marion.  God bless.  Be safe.  Have a great day at work.  Oh, man.  The listeners love Marion.  Yeah.  More Marion for the show.  It's really, it's an uncanny ability to trample everything.  It is astounding.  She can just ramble right over you.  Doesn't even miss a beat.  Missed every guy's insult to your point.  Is he a dentist?  Right. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, the guy's saying that listening to her is worse than root canal without any painkillers.  And she takes it as, I will canalize as a dentist.  It's just missed the point.  Totally.  Totally.  It's like a baseball bat of banality.  Walking into a bar and just cracking skulls.  Wow.  All right.  Well, did you take anything away from that phone call? 
[01:12:30]  Lady died.  Did you take anything away from her phone call today?  Yeah.  Oh, what?  But she calls me after I get out of the show.  Usually I'm on the train when she calls me.  Why does she call you?  She's a little jealous that you're here and she's not, right?  I don't think she's jealous.  Oh, she's jealous.  She's jealous.  Well, you said it.  I didn't.  Yeah.  I don't think she is.  Oh, there's some jealousy there.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think so.  She hates that you're getting all the attention.  You're the star.  Yeah.  Oh, you got to look up. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, there you go.  My nose.  Oh, boy.  I give it a little scratcher.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I am stupefied by that friendship.  That's perfect.  When she goes to Florida, that's going to be sad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll be breaking up.  Five, six, seven, eight years, whatever it is.  Yeah, yeah.  This couple, this friendship that's been together, strong for years.  I was once watching a chick flick with Kate Hudson and Jennifer Goodwin.  I don't know what it was called, but they were friends. 
[01:13:30]  They had that little, but they had competition like that.  Uh-huh.  It was like that, right?  If they ever make the movie of these two, those two would be great characters.  They already have.  It's called Midnight Cowboy.  I'm walking over here.  I just took a little rest.  I wasn't on a schedule.  I was going to put my cowboy hat in.  Well, why don't we take a break, and then I think the makeover will be done. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, we'll see.  In the very near future.  Come along nice, Lady Di.  Come along really nice.  Thank you.  They just made your eyes pop.  It is nice.  Your eyes are popping now.  Yeah.  They are?  Yeah, they look good.  Colin is going to be impressed.  It's just popping like they were in Casino.  It's a sequel for what we started.  Colin, you got anything?  No, nothing.  Oh, you mean promos?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got the tour Unconstitutional.  I'm going to be in Milwaukee and Minnesota April 8th and 9th.  And then some other days I can't remember. 
[01:14:30]  Well, what's the website?  People can go for all the latest info.  The tour Unconstitutional, Colin Quinn.  Very cool.  It drips off the tongue.  Yeah.  The tour Unconstitutional, Colin Quinn.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a horrendous name.  Awful.  You got to put all that in?  Yes.  I don't know what happened.  How about ColinQuinn.com or .net?  Yeah, no, that was a mistake.  You scared a lot of us with your early website.  My new website is quite good.  My new website is lovely.  Thank you.  As per Colin's suggestion. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's beautiful.  ColinQuinnunconstitutional.com.  I think it's the tour.  No?  Well, I'm sure the tour you can link to.  This one.  Look.  ColinQuinnunconstitutional.com.  That's it, that's it.  Yes, it's you.  You messed it up, I think.  ColinQuinnunconstitutional.com to see if he's coming to your city.  It's a great, great one-man show.  It really is.  How many dates have you done so far on this one?  Oh, I must have done, I mean, on the road, probably 50 or 60.  I've been all over this crazy land.  Colin. 
[01:15:30]  Yes, Diana?  I need to ask you a question.  Oh, certainly.  Are you ever going to be in Elizabeth, New Jersey?  Oh, my God.  That's a very good question.  Yeah.  Elizabeth, the theater scene in Elizabeth is not what it once was, I'll be honest.  It's mostly been reduced to cockfighting and the occasional television and window cell  is a clustered Guatemalans watching WCW.  However, if they get their theater scene together, I'll probably be there at some point, sure.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, the Ritz Theater. 
[01:16:00]  Oh.  What's that like?  It's nice in there.  Oh.  Fascinating.  Have you seen shows there?  Yes, I have.  What did you see there?  Microphone, Di.  I've seen a lot of...  Microphone.  Di, microphone.  You're holding the microphone down by your waist.  Well, I'm trying to get the makeover here.  No, no, I understand.  All right.  All right.  I saw a lot of, like, you know, 50s shows there.  Okay.  The Monkees, maybe?  No, no.  I wish they would come around.  Right.  Who doesn't?  I saw, like, a group that did a lot of Temptations songs. 
[01:16:30]  Oh.  Oh, I like that.  The Temptations?  A cover band.  Like, what do you call that when the band...  Tribute.  Tribute.  A cover tribute band, yeah.  Right, right, right.  And, you know, 50s and 60s groups.  Yeah.  Ah, there you go.  Motown shows, theme shows.  I get it.  That's it.  Motown shows.  Motown shows.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.  We should take a break, Lady Di.  Your makeover is almost done.  And I know Colin's got to leave soon, and we want to make sure he gets to see it.  I go to the doctor myself, Lady Di, so, you know, maybe I could leave by example. 
[01:17:00]  I go to the doctor, you go to Dr. Steve, Dr. Lydia.  Right.  Okay, okay.  All right.  After the break, the makeover should be done.  The big reveal.  A little ruge on the seats.  The big reveal.  Good.  Hey, it's Lady Di.  Anthony, if you're listening to this, you're the sexiest man on radio.  I'd love to wrap my lips around that big Italian hog of yours.  I would love for you to fumble these flapjacks and get a taste of dye juice.  The Opie and Anthony Show will be right back. 
[01:17:30]  After 20 years of amazing people with their obscene ability to entertain on an unprecedented level,  it's about time Opie and Anthony were celebrated.  Combing through their 20-year history, this is an Opie and Anthony radio gem.  Do you want to get rid of me?  Yes, sort of.  What are you doing?  What's his sign language?  Ed, he's our producer.  And he decides when a guest is getting a little too boring, and that was the sign that he usually gives. 
[01:18:00]  More disrespect to Ed.  We're having a good interview.  I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time I'll ever be on your show.  No, that was, yeah.  I've suffered your insults enough.  I certainly wouldn't come back again.  I'll be glad to talk to you about the Columbia documentary some other time when he's not around.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  I love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  But be sure that he's not in there. 
[01:18:30]  He does this all the time.  I'm a big fan.  I'm very happy to have you on the show.  He's a destroyer.  He's a destroyer.  Destroyer.  He's like Gordon Gekko.  He builds nothing.  He liquidates.  He's filthy.  He's greasy.  Yes, he is.  I don't want to smell his shorts.  He's a Svengali.  In quotes, I don't want to smell his shorts.  Ed Asner.  Bravo.  The great Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  You're a destroyer.  He called you a destroyer. 
[01:19:00]  Wait till Anthony hears this on the replay.  Oh, it was phenomenal.  Hey, Jimmy, get back here, man.  I started sweating.  Ed, no, come on.  Give me a handshake, please.  Fuck you, he said.  No, fuck you.  Dude, Ed Asner just said, fuck you.  Oh, that's phenomenal.  Hey, it's Lady Di.  Now back to the Opie and Anthony show.  I gave him my ass in the car. 
[01:19:30]  What a day.  We got Colin Quinn in the studio.  What a day.  Who's responsible for this Lady Di internship thing.  Chip just mean mugged me.  And according to the Twitter there, people either love it or hate it.  There's no real in-between on this one.  Oh, no.  You read one tweet where they can't stand this, and then the next tweet, they say it's the greatest. 
[01:20:00]  The best thing they've ever heard, and we should be killed.  Right.  It's just all over the place.  I think Lady Di's makeover is just about done there.  Yeah.  She wants to put her jewelry on.  Yeah, as well.  Yeah, you got to get all gussied up.  You got to get gussied up, of course.  That is good.  She should go.  Sam, you just got to bring her over here.  Is she going to go out at all?  I don't know.  She should.  She should have her go out for a coffee or something, and then the big reveal.  Oh, yeah?  She should do that.  You know, just to film reactions of people. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  Step up to the table.  Di.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  You know?  Have a flirt with someone.  Yeah.  What?  We don't want to miss it.  There's a lot of windows down there.  That's a good point.  And Colin's got to leave soon, so what do we do?  I mean, this makeover is really, really good.  In the meantime, there's some funny stories in the entertainment.  You guys are doing great.  John Travolta apologized to Idina Mizell with flowers.  Oh, really?  You got about 20 minutes out of that while we're stolen. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, that's the broad from Frozen.  Frozen sold 3.2 million Blu-rays.  First day out.  Thank God she's ready.  All right.  Yeah, come on.  Step up to the mic of honor.  Lady Di, look this way.  Step up to the microphone.  What are you doing?  I know that.  Put your jewelry there, dear.  Sam, block that.  That's what I was trying to move.  Window.  Yeah, yeah.  Block it.  I mean, just with you.  Yeah, stand there.  Stand in the right place.  So, we gave Lady Di a nice makeover. 
[01:21:30]  It was very well done.  Yeah, it is well done.  Yeah?  Makeup girl, yes.  I like it.  Okay.  Yeah, move closer to the mic.  Okay.  All right.  Let me see.  You ready?  Yeah.  All right.  We ready?  I'm going to kill that.  I look like a...  Go ahead.  Let me see.  What?  Oh, no.  What?  What's wrong?  What?  What's wrong?  You look good.  You look good.  Oh, Jesus.  Let me see.  What?  You worked hard on your makeover.  What are you doing to me?  What happened? 
[01:22:00]  You look good.  Go die, you silly goose.  Die, you look good.  Yeah, I really did.  Do you know what that's from?  I can't be like a movie star.  Yeah, you can.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can.  Do you know what that's from?  What?  Don't you know what that's from?  Do you know where?  It's like a goth look.  Yeah.  What?  All the kids are wearing it.  Yeah?  All the kids are wearing it these days.  You look great.  Oh, I see.  I see.  You look great.  Yeah.  It's like a geisha.  Yeah.  It's like a geisha.  Right.  Memoirs of a geisha.  No, no.  No, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You've got to leave it. 
[01:22:30]  I'm going to leave it like this for the rest of the day.  Yeah, just for the rest of it.  Just a little while.  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  What do you have a little fun with it?  Spoiled sport?  Have a little fun with it.  She looks like a Joy Division fan from 1981.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, hold on.  Have a little fun with it.  Come on.  Right, right.  You look like Robert Smith's wife.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  I'm hopeful.  That's not a question of being worried, babe.  Don't nervous.  I know.  Don't get nervous.  There's makeovers and there's makeovers.  Yeah, rule my party.  Don't get nervous.  Bring up my party.  Bring up my party.  It's great. 
[01:23:00]  It looks great.  He shoots like mirrors.  Oh, my goodness.  Spitshank Tommy.  There you go.  This is from a movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know it's from a movie, but...  You know a movie?  We're missing the bow tie.  Yeah.  All right.  That's probably the problem.  We needed the bow tie.  The red Kiwi Herman bow tie.  Right.  We're posting pictures of her new makeover on ONA Show on Twitter.  Nice.  You look rather adorable in that.  Nobody will even recognize me.  Oh, they will.  No, they'll recognize you.  Oh, yeah.  They're going to know it's me? 
[01:23:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Try to go into the bathroom here.  They'll recognize you.  Yeah.  No.  You look fun and ready to frolic.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's cute.  You look playful.  Thank you.  You know, for the first time in how long are you having fun?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Lighten up.  Lighten up.  It's like they painted dicks on your face like we at first suggested.  It was just a shock.  That's all.  A shock?  Yeah, believe me.  Okay.  You look cute.  You have your jeans on, your red sweater, and your little silly makeup.  It's all right.  Yeah.  It's harmless.  All right?  Marianne would be so jealous.  She'd just be talking over everything you said.  She wouldn't let you shine.  Right.  Yeah, right. 
[01:24:00]  That's perfect.  Lady Di is great.  Oh, this is wonderful.  Yeah, she should go down and get some coffee.  Oh, no.  What?  Not like this.  Why?  Not like this.  They're going to be looking at me.  Why not?  I'm going to go to the bathroom, and this time...  What?  ...to wipe the stuff off.  No.  No.  Don't wipe it off.  No.  You've got to go home.  The girls worked hard.  You've got to at least show Bill.  Come on.  Unfortunately...  No, I'm not going to go on the train like this, either.  Why?  You get right through. 
[01:24:30]  Unfortunately, you're not allowed...  Why?  ...to be looking at me.  Di, what?  You're not allowed in the bathroom.  That's true.  How are you going to wipe it off?  You're not allowed in the bathroom here.  I'm not allowed in the bathroom in Starbucks?  Go to Starbucks.  Yeah, you could go in Starbucks.  But don't wipe it off, Di.  You look cute.  You do look good.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Do you want to talk to the makeup artist?  Yeah, we should plug her, because she did a great job.  Yes.  An amazing job.  Here they are.  Don't worry so much.  Stop tugging on your hair.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it looks good.  It's full of bounce and luster.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  There you go.  Oh, boy.  Oh, she's going for the lips.  She was.  Hold on a second.  Connor, what are you doing?  Don't get makeup all over.  Don't get makeup all over.  Give him a kiss.  Give him a kiss.  Take the kiss.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Enjoy your creation.  Where are you going?  You get to leave?  Enjoy your creation.  You guys are lucky that I have a good sense of humor.  That's true.  We're happy.  We just happy.  I think we just broke Colin finally.  We probably broke him.  Yeah, I got his number.  Don't worry.  Colin will call you later. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, Colin.  Colin's had it.  Colin, remember that.  Yeah, tweet him.  Just tweet him and remind him to get in touch with you.  Yeah.  She's playful.  She's having fun.  If Colin doesn't have time, Jim will give you a call's number.  Yeah, I got that.  And you could give him a call.  Yeah, no worries.  See you, man.  Take it easy, Colin.  Have a good day.  Good luck.  Colin Quinn.  It looks really good.  They did a great job.  Yeah, why don't you sit down on the chair of honor?  There you go.  Let us know how it goes at the doctor.  Toodles.  I'm like, yo, baby.  As soon as I saw it, I'm like, whoa. 
[01:26:00]  Whoa.  Oh, careful.  Please don't fall in your new makeup.  You look silly.  You really do like Colin Quinn, huh?  Yeah, you like Colin.  Man.  Yeah, I think he likes me, too.  I think so, too.  He's shy, though.  You're going right for the lips, and I think he's getting a little bit freaked out.  Yeah, yeah, you're a little pushy.  You've got to play a little hard to get, I think.  But when you told the story about having anal in the 80s, he likes to have anal sex, and  most girls won't.  That drove him crazy, the fact that you did.  Yeah, yeah.  He liked that.  If you would give that up for him.  Where would go?  She's switching headphones. 
[01:26:30]  She knows.  Oh, my goodness.  She knows what she's doing.  Go ahead.  Take your time, dear.  Hang on.  Okay, there you go.  What the hell is going on?  I think you've got to hang out the rest of the day like that.  Yeah.  That's fine.  I'm ready for Halloween now.  You look good.  Well, you know, it's in October.  Is it?  It's a little while.  I know that.  You know that.  Oh, I wasn't sure.  I think Marion could have added something to that conversation.  I guess what I'm going to be for Halloween.  I don't know.  She'll see the pictures later on. 
[01:27:00]  I'm sure she will.  She sure will.  Do you know a guy named Jake from Elizabeth, New Jersey?  Yes.  La Mata.  He said he went eight rounds with you?  Let me find out.  He's got a story to tell.  Jake, go ahead.  Hi.  So, I don't have XM Radio, but my friend, he told me to call in.  Years ago, when I was still in high school, actually, I worked at a shop right in New Jersey.  Diana, do you remember me when you worked there for two weeks?  Do you recall working at that shop right?  That wasn't an Elizabeth, my dear. 
[01:27:30]  That was not an Elizabeth.  I'm from Elizabeth, but it was on the border.  Yeah, the shop right you're talking about is the one in Garwood.  Right.  Well, I consider it Elizabeth.  Is that close to Elizabeth?  A few towns away from Elizabeth.  It's the same one.  Yeah, you really are.  You're kind of hemming and hawing.  So, what happened here, Jake?  So, she worked there for two weeks.  This is, like I said, this was years ago, back when I was in high school.  But she worked there for two weeks.  The first week, she goes through training where they just share everything about the store. 
[01:28:00]  The second week, when they put her on register, the first day she was on register.  First of all, let me put it in mind, she was a disaster the whole time working there.  But the second week...  No, I was, and I was not.  Diana, you were a disaster.  We still, they talked about you, like a month after you left.  You were the worst employee ever.  Wow.  How many years ago was this?  Ah, man.  I was in high school, and I'm out of college now.  I don't know.  Five, six years ago?  Yeah.  So, what happened that second day?  So, when they put her on register, they shut you the checkout machine. 
[01:28:30]  When she was processing credit cards, she wouldn't enter them to actually process the charge.  People left over $4,000 worth of groceries after her second day.  Without getting any, without being charged for them?  Is that true?  She would put the card in the machine, and that's it.  She was fired on the spot.  It was almost...  Oh, lady, Di.  I was fired after two weeks of being there.  Why were you fired, Di? 
[01:29:00]  That's what he said.  It was, wait a minute, hold on a second.  Whoever you are, I really don't recall who you are.  What happened was...  No, no, seriously.  Let her explain.  What happened, Di?  What happened was a person came in with part cash and part credit.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  And your till back then had to...  You couldn't go over $30 or something like that.  It was some kind of rule or something.  Right.  And what happened was the guy behind me that was working another register, I said, what 
[01:29:30]  do you do in this case?  Uh-huh.  Because I, you know, we're part cash and part credit.  So the guy behind me said, send this person to the courtesy counter.  Just, you know, just, in other words, just charge her with the cash and the rest of it  with the credit card.  Uh-huh.  You got to send it to the courtesy counter.  She walked out with it.  That's how I got fired.  My till was $30 short.  $30 short?  Yeah.  Okay.  This guy is saying...  No, I mean...  No, seriously.  You made a few mistakes with the credit cards. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  Um, no, I just, um...  You forgot to log in...  You forgot to actually charge the credit card, is what he's saying.  No, no, no, no.  This person, okay, like I told you, was part cash, part credit.  No, I understand that part of it.  All right.  But that's...  But it wasn't just that.  That wasn't...  Why didn't you send it to the courtesy counter?  Because the person behind me that worked longer than me over there told me to send  this person to the courtesy counter.  Were you only allowed to have $30 in your till or something?  No, no, no.  The 30...  My till was $30 short. 
[01:30:30]  Okay, yeah, no, because...  Because of what?  You didn't send him to the courtesy counter that you were supposed to.  Why didn't you tell him that?  I told her to go to the courtesy counter.  Instead of going to the courtesy counter...  About the courtesy counter.  She left.  She had it.  And, uh...  I would have left, too.  That's, um...  And then when you count your till in the end...  Right with the till.  Sick of hearing the word till.  $30 short.  I was the one that was...  Where was the $30 short from?  Well, because...  I don't know.  I really don't know how...  How do they know it was $30 short? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Because when I...  Let me get my side.  I was supposed to...  What?  Go ahead.  So, all right.  That happened dozens of times your first day.  So, we had a line queue.  Not only at her register, but at the actual convenience counter as well.  So, anytime someone had a credit card, she'd have them bag up all their fucking groceries.  They were already on the belt.  And then re-send them to the courtesy counter.  It was a fucking disaster.  Oh, my God.  She couldn't send anything properly.  Well, maybe she was improperly trained. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  It was her second week there.  I was fucking 16, 17 years old at the time.  Yeah, but she was improperly trained, sir.  She is literally the worst human...  Not the worst human, my apologies, but the worst employee that store had.  Worst employee ever.  They still talk about you over there.  It's okay.  So, your pictures...  They still talk about you.  And you gave it a good try.  Absolutely.  I did give it a good try.  It just didn't work out.  Go to the courtesy counter.  That's all.  It didn't work out.  Go to the courtesy counter.  If there's a problem...  Well, I was listening to somebody else.  What did they tell you to do? 
[01:32:00]  They told me to send the person to the courtesy counter.  And that's what I did.  So, that's why I could move on instead of having the line back up.  Where was the $30 short from?  See, this is what I'm trying to figure out.  She's still working it out.  All these years later.  I might have gave that even, you know, through the course of the day.  I might have gave the person a wrong change.  You know what I mean?  So many people that it added up to $30.  How'd they know you were short?  What happened? 
[01:32:30]  Well, at the end, you've got to count...  But this guy's saying it was thousands of dollars, not $30.  You've got everything like that.  You've got to count everything.  And the money that you have...  Where do you put them?  The till?  Shut up with the till.  You want to know, right?  No, I hate the till.  Wait, what about the till?  I wasn't listening.  What's up with the till?  What is the till?  I didn't know what the till is.  Yeah, what is a till?  That's your register.  What is?  That's your register.  Why would you just say the register?  My till.  It is a till.  But that's what it is. 
[01:33:00]  That's a till, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, it's when you do something when the cards are done and they know you have a certain hand.  That's the lingo of the trade.  So for some reason, my register was short.  What is a register, though?  Is that the till?  Yeah, that's the same thing.  Okay.  All right, I'm on.  I'm on.  And I was supposed to have a certain amount at the end of my shift.  Right.  And I was $30 short.  And they said, that's it.  Where were you short, though?  They took me in the office.  Where were you short to $30?  I just explained everything to you.  I wasn't listening.  I was checking Twitter and making sure the phones were cool. 
[01:33:30]  Well, you have to hear me.  Where was the $30 supposed to be?  It was supposed to be in the till with the rest of the money.  Oh, I see.  In the register with the rest of the money.  One more time.  Hey.  Okay.  What's she saying?  What's she saying?  She was $30 short in cash.  Like, actual money-to-money, hand-to-hand.  Cash.  Credit charges.  So she fucked up not only the credit charges.  I missed you.  No, I did.  I did.  But cash transfer.  You fucked up.  But, Jake, I got a question for you.  I did.  Why the anger?  Well, all right. 
[01:34:00]  So during her training, I was in high school.  So I was one of the kids that had to give her the tour of the store the first week.  She, I mean, so she was, she had this cough.  I don't know.  I don't remember him.  She had this cough that was, it would echo off the wall.  You knew when she was walking down, walking through the aisles.  You could hear her cough bouncing all over the store.  Like, day three or four, she had to throw up in the bathroom.  We had to send her home early.  She was, she was.  Did you have to go home early because you got sick? 
[01:34:30]  No.  One of those days?  No, I did not.  Maybe.  This guy.  Maybe.  First of all, I don't remember who he is.  And second of all, yeah, somebody did give me a tour of the store, but not, you know,  not the actual store upstairs, like your break room and stuff.  Uh-huh.  You know, because I already knew what the store looked like.  You did?  Yeah, of course I did.  I used to go shopping there.  So I already know what the store looks like.  Did you ever think when you were shopping there that you'd actually be working there?  Yeah, well.  Just wondering.  No, that, that job, two weeks, eh, you know what you're going to do. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  And plus you had to, you couldn't park in the parking lot.  Oh, fuck that.  You had to park because.  What were you supposed to do?  You were supposed to park at Gumpert's Field, which is, uh.  Gumpert's Field?  Which is a baseball field, like a park over there.  That's where you were supposed to park.  Who's Gumpert?  Yeah, what kind of.  I don't know who Gumpert is.  What kind of.  It's a 20-foot walk.  You have to walk 20 feet.  You're fucking lazy.  It ain't that.  Why the anger, though?  I don't understand why you're so mad about it. 
[01:35:30]  It's just.  First of all, this was so many years ago.  You guys weren't even on the air back then.  I don't understand the field.  The what?  The field.  This Gumpert.  Well, that's a park where the kids.  What kind of park?  The Little League kids.  What do you mean Little League?  Little League kids.  My son was there, too.  He was Little League back then.  What's Little League?  Is that like football or soccer or something?  That's baseball.  That's baseball.  Okay.  Yeah.  So it's a baseball field?  It's a baseball field and nobody was playing baseball because it was early.  Right.  So what?  And that's where you had to park.  You park on the field? 
[01:36:00]  No, you don't park on the field.  Why would you park on the field?  You went to every tire tracks once the kids do get there?  Yeah.  What?  The tire tracks would still be on the field, no?  You said you parked on Gumpert Field.  That's the name of the place.  So you parked on the actual field.  That's crazy.  Did Gumpert give you his permission?  That's the Gumpert Field.  I can't even say it.  The Gumpert Field parking lot.  Gumpert.  Oh, the parking lot.  Gotcha.  Right.  Anything else, Jay?  No, I just wanted to say my friend told me to call up. 
[01:36:30]  She's literally one of the weirdest humans I've ever been around.  It was only two weeks.  That's what she thinks of you.  She just burped.  Just belching into the whole belch.  I had a sip of ginger ale.  That's why.  It's gassy.  It's understandable.  That's all right.  Don't beat yourself.  All right, Jake.  Thanks.  Bye, Jake.  Whoever you are.  All right.  We have Mike Baker on the line.  Real quick.  Oh, Mike.  Hold on, Mike.  Can we mention the makeup artist?  Sure, of course.  Why is she leaving? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, they probably got to make sure she got plugged in.  Oh, okay.  They did a great job.  Deadly Darling on Instagram.  What's your name?  Alyssa Bono.  And my Instagram is at Deadly Darling.  Deadly Darling.  Is that your makeup company?  Yes.  Nice.  You did a really good job.  And actually, relatively quickly.  Yeah.  Yeah, real fast.  Very cool.  I was painting like this all the time.  Hold Diane to the mic.  Oh, Jesus.  Right.  No, you couldn't hear the microphone.  You asked if she did face painting.  Do you do face painting like this all the time?  Is that what you do?  Well, this is a little bit of a special case for you.  Yeah.  Today I'm doing Godworth. 
[01:37:30]  I can see that.  Do you have anything to clean it off with?  It's fine.  You're not cleaning it.  I can't stay with this all day.  I can't stay with this all day.  No, you look good.  Just go with it.  All right.  And if you go to her Instagram, Deadly Darling, you can see girls in bikinis getting turned  into zombies.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  We got our pal, Mike Baker, on the phone.  Mike.  Ex-CIA.  There you go, sir.  Does this come off?  I don't think you're ever ex-CIA.  True.  Good point.  You always got to keep your eyes open, right? 
[01:38:00]  Oh, man.  Constantly keeping those eyes open.  Keep the head on a swivel.  Mike.  Hello, Mike.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Thank you.  Good.  How are you?  Well, we called you a day late, I think, because it looks like they found the plane.  We were going to get you on with your theories and stuff, but it's starting to look like this  is the plane off Perth, about 1,500 miles out into the ocean.  Am I going to add it on to that?  I like how they say that.  They give that description as if everyone knows where Perth is.  Oh.  Perth, Australia.  Yeah.  From Mick Jagger's holdup.  Which is like southwest. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  The southwest tip of Australia.  Yeah.  That's true.  But I've been amazed by how everybody's had a theory.  Yeah.  And, you know, and some people have, with almost no conclusive evidence to point to anything,  they've had, you know, really strong emotions about that particular theory that they've fallen  down on, right?  They think, oh, this is what happened.  And you talk to them, you say, well, look, that's a nice scenario, but that's as probable  as any other scenario that's out there right now.  Mm-hmm.  They just don't know anything. 
[01:39:00]  But for me, it was interesting to tell in a situation like that, you know, everybody  felt so invested in it because everybody flies, but then after it drags on for a few  days, you know, the tinfoil hats come out and everybody starts thinking they know what  the hell happened to it.  It was just an amazing display of people coming up with their own theories and then just changing  them as more or less evidence came in.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of speculation.  Yes.  The terrorism angle was kind of a movie plot thing to go with. 
[01:39:30]  I was caught up in that one early on.  It's like, oh, well, you know, planes can't just disappear like that.  But this does kind of open up some security risks.  I think we saw something here.  Regardless of what happened to this plane, there is a scenario where a pilot could take a plane,  divert it, and use it for EVIL.  Well, you know what they had, ever since this thing started, right, in the very beginning, 
[01:40:00]  you had really three basic options, three broad options.  One was the idea of some sort of catastrophic or cascading mechanical failure.  Right.  The other was terrorism in some form and for some reason.  And the third was pilot action.  And that never changed during the whole course of this thing.  And from an operational investigative standpoint, you know, until you get some information that  looks credible and solid and points you into a certain direction and says, okay, you can  take these other ideas off the table, you've got to leave everything out there. 
[01:40:30]  And you're going to say, okay, they're all possible.  But it was just, it was one of those things where, you know, people couldn't help themselves.  And it wasn't just as if they said, well, this is what happened.  They took the plane and they landed it, you know, somewhere.  Well, then people started saying, well, they landed at a particular location.  You know, how do you know that?  And it was the strangest thing.  And everyone had their theory.  And like you said, it does point to some issues.  And I think one of the things that was, for me, again, also interesting was how, you know, 
[01:41:00]  we had this whole, you know, crap with Snowden and the leak of all the information.  Never even assuming that NSA is constantly watching us.  Right.  So you had these people saying, well, how come the NSA doesn't just release data about the  old cell phones that passengers were carrying?  Yeah.  As if that's what they do.  And that story got so twisted and full of crap that, you know, again, it's, it's, it's,  to me that, you know, it, the story is obviously tragic, you know, regardless of how it ends  up.  But, you know, for me, part of it was just the way that it unfolded. 
[01:41:30]  I mean, I got to the point where they were calling and asking me to come on and talk about,  not about the plane, but talk about people's theories and say, what do you think about this  guy's theory?  Right.  Right.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  We have Dr. Orbani is here.  She's our guest for today.  Um, where do you think the airplane is right now?  I know it's in the ocean, but where in the ocean?  Good one, lady.  That's a very good question.  I, it, it, it, yeah.  I think we might have started with that.  I'm going to say what I always say, which is who knows?  I mean, they say it's like, you know, like we were talking about, 1,500 miles off the 
[01:42:00]  coast of the southwest coast.  Right.  But at that point, you know, the satellite images were, were what?  Three days old now.  Yeah.  Three days old.  You know, so you've got to factor in the currents of the ocean, the wind conditions, and where  that's pushing everything.  And, you know, it's going to take them some time to find it, but it's floating around out  there.  And no one's sure what, uh, if this is, uh, if these are pieces of the plane yet?  No, they don't know.  They got two objects.  There's one could be about the length of a, of a wing.  Yep.  And they just don't, they just don't know. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  And so once again, we've got to stand around, but we can also stand around while they fill  up 24 hours.  I think we're going to, I think we're going to know soon though, because they did say  that the, a Norwegian ship has made it to the, um, what's that?  The debris, so.  So there's some traffic out there.  So they'll, they've got planes out there already.  Yeah.  Weather conditions are awful, but they'll, they'll figure.  They have sent, Mike, they have sent so many ships and aircraft to that location that I,  I'm assuming they, they're pretty sure that this is, uh, the wreckage.  What about Frank? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  They don't know, but they've got it.  They've got to go off of something.  Right.  Right.  They've got to investigate, you know, every lead.  And this is, this is about the only thing they've got right now.  But you're right.  I mean, it points to some military or some, uh, some security issues.  Absolutely.  I think that's the story.  After all is said and done, they find out, uh, they find the plane, they find out everything  that happened.  The thing is, what can be done to, uh, make this a little safer for people that are flying  if, if a pilot, um, you know, they're not infallible, uh, to, uh, uh, to, to persuasion 
[01:43:30]  from terrorists.  Excuse me, Frank.  Oh, that's right.  What?  Excuse me, Frank.  It's not Frank.  It's Mike.  Who's Frank?  Hold on.  Let me get, let me get my buddy Frank on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Well, I can't believe, I can't believe she's on for, for two minutes with my cover.  Okay.  I did.  All right.  All right.  Um, do you, do you think the sharks know about this airplane?  Maybe, uh, they couldn't interview one of the sharks. 
[01:44:00]  Interview?  What do you mean interview?  Sharks?  Yeah.  You say interview sharks?  Well, do you think the sharks know about, uh, this airplane?  I'm going to say what I always say.  It's as good a scenario as any right now.  Okay, well, uh, I hope everybody is okay.  I, I, I, I just hope.  They're not okay.  They're dead.  No, no, I just hope that they find the people in 10,000 feet of water.  I just hope that they find the people in 10,000 feet of water.  It's pretty obvious at this point.  No one's okay.  They're pretty fucking far from okay.  Yeah, there's, there's not a chance they're okay.  Do you think this is terrorism?  Well, you know what, something diverted the plane. 
[01:44:30]  And that, and again, pointing to what we're talking about, where there's going to, the  bigger story, you're absolutely right.  The bigger story now, very shortly, is going to be what all this meant.  Right.  But you know what, one of my brothers was, uh, he just retired.  He was a senior pilot at Southwest.  Yep.  And he used to say, because they had this argument after 9-11.  Excuse me, Frank?  Yeah.  What can I help you with now?  In the middle of it.  About the, about the thing about the Sharks, that, uh, comment, just forget about that.  That's, uh, very insensitive of me. 
[01:45:00]  It was.  Okay.  Well, no, we've already, we've already logged it.  I, uh, I just passed that comment along to my colleague.  Logged it.  And, uh, yeah.  I'm sorry that I said that, all right?  All right.  I'll be talking to you later.  Jesus.  But the, the, uh, you know, the point being, it's right up to 9-11, you know, we had this  argument about, do we arm the pilots?  Do we put, you know, but.  Right.  And a lot of these pilots are former military.  Well, as my, as my brother and a bunch of other pilots would say, well, look, you don't  have to worry about us having a handgun.  We've got the stick of the airplane in our hands.  Right.  We could take this thing down any time.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  And so, you know, that's always been an issue.  And we've had a couple of other cases where the pilot action is, is obviously resulted  in tragic circumstances.  But, you know, then you've got the issues of, well, you know, everybody out there thought  that a plane was tracked constantly.  Yeah.  And now, now we find out that it's not.  Yeah.  That's, uh, that's a little, uh, frightening too.  You know, I think, I think, I think, um.  Yeah.  The security risk in this whole thing is going to be the big story after the, all  of a sudden done with, uh, finding this plane and whatnot. 
[01:46:00]  So.  And then we're all going to realize that Russia's already marched into Poland.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At that point.  Yeah.  What do you, what do you think of that whole thing?  No, I think we, we, it's amazing.  We're like, we're raccoons chasing after a shiny object.  You know, this thing obviously, you know, was, was fascinating.  It has been fascinating.  It's tragic.  Uh, but we just, we, we can't multitask.  So meanwhile, you know, Putin has been engaged in, in, in finalizing the annexation of Crimea.  He's done exactly what he wanted to do.  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  Um, he's now starting to make noises about, uh, about Estonia of all places.  Uh, uh, and we just don't seem to care at this stage because we're all looking over here.  We just, we can't stay focused on more than one topic at a time, or at least a lot of  the media seems unable to do that.  Yeah.  This, uh, is just another big distraction.  Uh, while something else a lot more important is going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And not a, not a single major network thought to even interview one shark during this whole  thing.  Not one shark was interviewed.  The sharks get died, but put the headphones on. 
[01:47:00]  This is bad.  Lady Di, why do you keep, you're talking into the mic as, as, as Mike Baker is, is, is,  you can hear her telling us.  Yes.  You just hear her rambling on in the background.  All right.  All right.  I'll keep the, I'll keep the headphones on.  What were you saying?  Tell them what you were saying.  What were you saying?  Was it important?  That was a very insensitive comment because.  We understand.  All right.  You know what else is insensitive and rude?  What?  When somebody's trying to talk and you're rambling over them.  Sorry about that.  Okay.  But why'd you say that though? 
[01:47:30]  That was, that was Chris.  She feels very bad about saying that.  Well, she should.  Well, yeah, that was very tasteless.  She didn't get in trouble for that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't doubt it.  Mike.  Yeah.  You know, I think that it'll, it'll be amazing.  If this turns out to be the wreckage,  the speed with which we'll move off of this story will be,  we'll be studying.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No one will give a shit after that.  That's for sure.  Right.  What, what else are you working on?  You know what?  We're getting ready to film the second season of that travel channel show.  First season went very well. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  So we're getting ready to do that.  And what's the name of the show?  Well, it's called America Declassified.  Okay.  Uh, did, uh, did, uh, did very well.  And basically we just go around to places and, and, uh, you know, film interesting stuff.  And, and I do interesting things and, well, I'm really selling the show, aren't I?  You are.  I've seen it.  It really is great.  Hold on.  What was the channel again?  Uh, travel channel.  I think I had that.  Do you get the travel channel?  Um, uh.  You probably don't. 
[01:48:30]  Travel channel.  I don't know.  Isn't that a basic table?  It's not the one that broadcasts.  No, no, no.  I think now you're just doing damage control after that comment.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  I, I like that show.  I, I, like I said, I saw, I saw the one, um, I saw the one you did on the MLK, uh, assassination.  That was pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They wanted us to lighten it up a little bit.  Uh, they, they felt like we, we started steering off into dark areas and.  I liked it.  So we'll, uh, yeah.  I, sort of, I would, you know, you, you, you never know with the taste of, of, uh, the network. 
[01:49:00]  But, you know, it, it, it did very well.  So we'll, uh, we'll go out there and, and, and see what we can find.  Lots of interesting places to visit.  Yeah.  People just normally can't get to.  Yep.  So that's, uh, that's it.  And we got the, you know, continuing to do business on a daily basis with, with diligence.  Oh, that was a plug.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Other than that.  Yeah.  I just, I appreciate it.  You're right.  We're, you know, we're at the tail end.  I suspect of this, of this Malaysian aircraft story.  Hopefully.  I know it sounds odd, but you know, everybody wants some closure on it. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  They'll just drop it like a hot potato once they actually find it in a couple of days.  No, because then the NTSB report will come out or whatever it is.  There's a whole, there's a whole second part of it.  There's a whole second part.  But as far as this 24 hour news cycle on this thing, um, they'll stop.  They're going to start focusing on her comments about the sharks and how chaseless that was.  Exactly.  Well, we got a shark expert on the phone, actually.  What?  Who's saying that Lady Di's not that crazy with this theory.  Uh, Sean in Brooklyn, go ahead.  You're on with Mike Baker as well. 
[01:50:00]  I'm not a shark expert.  I'm half retarded.  But, if you think about it, if you think about it, they got a lot of sharks tagged in the ocean.  They follow the movements of the sharks at any time.  El Drunko might be right.  If you see a mass movement of tagged sharks in one direction, why not take a look?  It's better than what those other assholes are looking at.  Boy.  Follow the sharks.  I know what a shark looks like.  That's great.  That's not a bad idea.  You know what?  It's amazing to think that the experts didn't come up with this one already. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  That's a pretty good idea, Mike.  You've got to admit it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I suspect NSA's already on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Their own mechanical sharks.  Yeah.  And Jim's right.  I have a good question.  You know, there'll be a follow-on effort here.  They'll be looking at the security issues.  They'll be looking at a variety of other things related to this.  But I just think it is amazing that you could have a network.  Excuse me, Frank.  We've got a 24-hour coverage.  Yes.  Can I help you?  Yes.  I just wanted to find out, are they sending scuba divers down where they think that the 
[01:51:00]  airplane might be?  As opposed to hot air balloons.  Yeah.  You know, to see if the plane is there.  You want a scuba diver going down 10,000 feet.  That's what you want.  Frank, that is a good idea, though.  You've got to admit.  I think they're putting them right over the edge of the vessel now.  No, it's a very, very deep part of the ocean.  It's a deep part of the ocean.  Yeah, well.  I don't think scuba is suitable.  The Titanic is in a deep part of the ocean, too.  I can't believe you're making fun of this.  I'm not making fun of it. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, my God.  Did you ever see scuba divers around the Titanic, either?  Oh, no.  No.  Step careful.  No.  When I see that movie, all they do is send down some kind of machine or something like  that.  Right.  Way to joke about a machine.  Really?  A lot of people died on that ship.  What's that?  I know.  Was it over 3,000 or something?  Oh, boy.  What?  I'm flustered right now. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I don't know where to go with this, either.  Excuse me, Frank.  Again.  Oh.  How much money do you make?  What a rude question.  That was bad as some of the other things we've been going through just now.  Well, that's true.  Well, Frank, this has been a wonderful phone call.  Yeah.  I don't want to subject Mike to any more of this poor shit.  I get it.  But this is just like being on Fox, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is your last name, Frank?  I'll say this much.  It's a lot easier being in studio with you guys than being on the phone. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Be part of the whole friggin' debacle.  Excuse me, Frank.  His name is Mike.  It just never ends.  You know what I'm going to do?  Frank or Mike or whoever you are.  His name is Mike.  What is your last name?  Mike Baker.  It's Mike Baker.  Mike Baker.  Thank you for checking in, Mike.  All right.  Have a good day.  We'll talk to you soon.  I'd love to show.  Thank you.  One more.  There goes Mike Baker.  Say the last thing.  What?  Mike Baker. 
[01:53:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah, she was asking some poignant questions.  God.  I know.  Sharks.  What a friggin' disaster.  Can I say hi to Wendy for a minute here?  Wendy, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I think we might owe you an apology, but we'll see.  Go ahead, Wendy.  I'm just wondering why Lady Di can't shut the fuck up ever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We do, too. 
[01:53:30]  Lady Di?  Comment?  Annoying.  I'm sorry to annoy you.  I'm trying to listen to Anthony and Opie talk to somebody.  I'm used to sit there and talk and make it about yourself.  I'm not making it about myself.  How do you figure that?  I'm not doing that.  But, Wendy, this is all she has.  Yeah, but...  This is all she has.  Oh, man.  She's got to go back to whatever she does after this week.  Drinks.  Right.  She needs to learn to shut up for five seconds. 
[01:54:00]  But this is all she's got.  Oh, man.  Learn to shut up.  All right.  People listen to you guys for you guys, not for her.  Yeah.  True.  All right, Wendy.  Thank you, Wendy.  Thank you, Wendy.  Lady Di looks like when Jackie Gleason played that clown.  Yes.  Was it Gijot or Gijo or whatever his name was?  Gijo.  Gijo.  You played a clown one time?  Yes.  That's why you brought it up.  And my first girlfriend, Michelle, made me watch that because she loved it.  And me and my Jamaican friend just laughed at it because we were stoned. 
[01:54:30]  Really?  It was like a really poignant movie.  She wasn't happy with your lefter.  She was none too pleased with our lefter.  That happened with me with a girlfriend when we watched Bill, the one with Mickey Rooney  as the retarded guy.  Hilarious.  And she's like, you've got to see this.  And she was crying at some point.  And I just thought laughing.  And she was literally punching me.  She was so angry that I couldn't, like, get into the sadness of it.  You didn't get sad when he sang the Sister Sarah song?  Oh, Sarah, where have you gone, Billy boy, Billy boy? 
[01:55:00]  That song sucked.  Stupid Dennis Quaid's playing the harmonica with him.  And they end up friends.  Sure they do.  It's exploitive.  I hated fucking that song.  And Denny kicked me in the guts.  Great movie.  It's terrific.  A lot of laughs in Bill.  Oh, yeah.  What's the matter, Lady Di?  Is that Don Imus?  Yes, it's Don Imus.  Yes.  Why?  She's looking at Sam.  How are your glasses today? 
[01:55:30]  They still have to.  They're smeary.  Yeah, they're smeary because usually I tear up a little bit when I get up in the morning.  Why?  I don't know.  It was always like that.  More leakage.  That's a race.  She's rubbed all the makeup off of her nose because she wipes her boogies all the time with her hand.  She's got a little allergies.  She's constantly wiping her boogies.  You got a little boogies today?  It's okay.  What are you looking at still?  Now I'm looking at NASCAR racing, whatever that is. 
[01:56:00]  Oh.  Racing, racing.  Why would you study it like that?  Just looking at it.  I don't know.  Okay.  Yeah.  Should we take a break?  Yeah, I have to tinkle.  Are you going to capitalize on this whole thing that we're doing and use it as a little springboard?  A launching pad.  Right.  To get a job.  Do you want me to go get a job with makeup like this?  Absolutely.  You're waking up early.  You're coming in.  Right.  You're being productive. 
[01:56:30]  Don't you want to continue doing that and not go back home to just sitting on the couch?  Well, there's no reason we can't make this a two-week job.  Whoa.  Slow down.  It's a one-week job.  There's no reason it can't be two weeks of productivity.  Well.  That's up to you guys.  Did you hear that groan?  That's up to you guys.  Yeah.  The collective groan of the audience.  Yeah.  I mean, if we want to do something, maybe we could really help Lady Di out and give her a second week here at SiriusXM.  Oh, no.  She's doing a good job.  Think about it.  Just think about it.  She'll cook about it.  We've already interviewed another mongoloist for the job. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  The makeup artist.  What's their plug again there, Sam?  Oh, it's Deadly Darling on Instagram.  On Instagram.  You can check out the work.  Good stuff.  Yeah, really good.  Very fast.  Yes, very fast.  And we tagged her Instagram and Twitter accounts, both on O&A Show on Twitter.  Very good.  And just click from there.  Nice.  Very cool.  Lovely girls.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to get into some other things after the break. 
[01:57:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think what it was.  There was something.  You guys get paid good?  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Oh, enough about the money.  Hey, it's Lady Di.  Unless you're wearing a diaper like me, you probably have to go take a shit.  O&A will be right back.  Don't go anywhere.  I won't be.  We had a very, very, very, happy bird vision. 
[01:58:00]  We had a very, very, happy bird vision.  We had a very, very, happy bird vision.  We had a very, heavy, ah, bird vision tonight.  We had a very, derison, deris, derison.  Bite less or hate.  Derison tonight.  We had a very, very, deris, derison. 
[01:58:30]  We had a very, very, deris, derison.  Deris, deris, deris, deris, 
[01:59:00]  deris, deris, deris, deris, deris, deris, deris, deris, deris, deris, deris.  Hey, it's Lady Di.  Now back to the O.P. and Anthony show.  I hope Amp becomes the second guy to anally penetrate me. 
[01:59:30]  See, they're hinting.  Search officials call discovery of possible debris best lead so far.  Yeah.  We're considering all the other leads were no leads.  Right.  We're fucking Courtney Love.  That was the next more credible lead, Courtney.  I hear this new satellite.  I think Yoko found this.  It's amazing.  Did you see the one, the picture of Bigfoot?  And it's the same type of you guys.  Oh, really?  Hands, legs, signed CL. 
[02:00:00]  That's funny.  That went around yesterday on the old Twitter.  Courtney Love.  Courtney Love.  Courtney Love.  With her baby handwriting.  Why are we making fun of her?  She was great on this show.  She was not sexy, dude.  She turned me on a lot.  She was amazing on this show.  I hope she comes back soon.  We got, who's coming in next?  Rick.  Yeah, Rick from Pawn Stars.  Rick Harrison.  Rick Harrison.  He's a little late, but he'll be here in a few minutes.  Cool.  From Pawn Stars, of course.  He's the, you know, he's the guy, pretty much the head guy. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  I just heard Chip got a pet.  What?  Really?  Yeah.  What?  I got a pet wolf.  Oh, God.  No, you don't.  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  I got a wolf.  A wolf?  Where'd you get it?  Fucking found him.  No, you didn't.  Chip loves to lie.  I ain't lying.  To try to sound cool.  His name's Wolfie.  Wolfie? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  A pet wolf.  Full grown.  He's an attack wolf.  Oh, yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Protects you?  Yep.  Yeah, of course he does.  This is all bullshit.  It's not.  Chip imagines things like this.  Yeah, it'd be cool if I had a wolf.  You don't think Chip has a wolf in a wolfie?  No.  I used to know kids, like, when I was growing up, they were the lying kids that always had  to be cooler than everyone else, and they'd have, like, a German shepherd and try to tell 
[02:01:30]  you, like, he's half wolf.  Shut up.  He is not.  He's a fucking German shepherd dummy.  You know how dogs came about, don't you?  How's that?  I don't know.  I'm just asking.  Oh.  I don't know.  They've been domesticated for quite some time.  Right?  They come from wolves, right?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meh.  Neil Tyson was talking about it on Cosmos.  Oh, was he?  When he wasn't dramatically walking away. 
[02:02:00]  Walking off frame?  Or walking out of the shot.  Yeah, we pretty much created doggies.  Yeah.  Was there a purpose, or was it just to have pals?  I think it started with unnatural selection, and then we turned it to natural selection.  But to have pals?  Just to have, like, a dog pal, or were they useful?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Generation after generation.  They kept the good ones, got rid of the bad ones.  You keep doing that, and guess what?  Most dogs become good.  Then you get good doggies.  Yeah, you get the good doggies to help you out when you're one of those gatherers. 
[02:02:30]  And then every so often, there's some little fucking primitive thing in one of their heads,  and they decide to tear your fucking throat out.  They're not good anymore.  It's amazing how that instinct is still there as a wild animal.  Got to tell you, that Cosmos show, are you watching?  No, I haven't seen.  I mean, I make fun of the fact that he walks out of frame, but man, that's well, well done.  The production value on it's amazing, too.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  I'll catch it.  I'll check it out.  I'm so, uh...  I'm only a one-show-at-a-time guy.  I can't watch other shows.  I can't watch other shows.  I watch one show at a time.  Some girls just like to wiggle.  This place is hilarious.  Some girls just like to wiggle past our window.  It's so obvious.  They put a little wiggle on their step.  Oh, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. 
[02:03:30]  Hold still.  That shit's hilarious.  Yeah, so...  Oh, where were we?  Oh, before we were so rudely interrupted.  Well, we got the Pawn Stars.  Pawn Star guy.  Now, I guess Lady Di has brought in some stuff...  Yes.  ...that Rick is going to look at and assess...  Yes.  ...and make an offer on.  Well, he can make an offer if he wants.  That's for sure, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  I've watched the show many times. 
[02:04:00]  I think I've seen every episode.  For real?  Yeah, for reals.  Wow.  And I can't imagine Lady Di having anything that he would want to purchase or he would think he could purchase and make money off of.  Because that's what he's all about.  Making money.  Well, she's going to surprise you today.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  She's going to surprise you.  Somehow.  She's got a few things.  I don't think...  That she's willing to part with for the right money. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is it memorabilia?  He likes memorabilia.  Ah, yes.  Any type of historical stuff, war-related stuff.  A little memorabilia, yes.  He really does enjoy that.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yep.  Somehow, I don't think she's going to...  What are they doing with the Rob Ford video?  Can we see this video yet?  Oh, yeah.  Are they just talking about it?  Oh.  Are they smoking?  What's he doing?  Smoking some crack?  The new one that came out.  Or they're talking about it. 
[02:05:00]  Cop says, video shows Rob Ford inhaling from a glass pipe.  Oh, I haven't seen that video yet.  Glass pipe.  Oh, boy.  There's another new video?  Sucking the glass dick.  I thought you were talking about the video I was talking about earlier this week.  Which one was that now?  The Ford Brothers YouTube show where they're bashing what's-his-name from House of Cards because  he wouldn't take a photo with them.  Oh.  Who wouldn't?  Kevin Spacey.  Kevin Spacey wouldn't take a photo with who?  I guess the Ford Brothers were told not to ask Kevin Spacey for a photo at Kimmel. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  And so they made a YouTube show.  Why would-who told them not to?  Kevin Spacey.  They told them not to?  Probably producers.  I don't know.  Yeah, producers probably said, no, stay away from fucking Kevin Spacey.  Is Kevin Spacey a dick when it comes to that stuff?  Then he tweeted back-  Does he have a reputation?  He tweeted back all he had to do was ask.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that was probably some jerk-off publicist.  Right.  Or some dickhead.  They shouldn't have listened.  Right.  Yes, exactly.  Some dickhead publicist. 
[02:06:00]  Mm-hmm.  That House of Cards is fucking good.  Yeah, it is.  I think it's over, though.  No, they're doing it now this season.  Of what?  Him as the president?  Oops.  What?  Travis throws his hands up in the air.  Why?  Why?  Why?  What happened?  You can't just not watch anything anymore.  Watch what?  How's the Cards?  Did he give it away?  Kevin Spacey.  Just skip right to season three, right? 
[02:06:30]  Oh, you gave something away?  Just watch season three.  Oops.  I'll just start from there.  What?  What'd you say?  I didn't say anything.  Listen to the replay.  Yeah, I don't...  Are you mad that he blew that for you?  Yeah, I'm a little upset, John.  Oh, well then.  Oh, who couldn't see where this show's going?  Get over it.  Get over it.  What are you doing in there?  All this writing and crying, pitching a fit.  Get over it.  I saw him pitching a fit in there.  Travis was pitching a bit of a fit. 
[02:07:00]  A little bit.  A little bit.  A March Madness Seinfeld Brackets?  What's going on there?  I saw that.  What?  What's that about?  I don't know.  They're doing this Seinfeld Brackets thing where they have Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer  taking up quarters and have episodes that feature each of them pitted against each other's  other episodes.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And it goes down and down until you get the best Seinfeld episode.  I don't know.  No, I saw it online. 
[02:07:30]  Some Fox affiliate.  Is it a Fox affiliate?  That's pretty smart.  Yeah, it was pretty big.  You know, a way to capitalize on the March Madness Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  And then what is it?  That millionaire dude?  The billionaire dude?  Who?  Warren Buffett?  Warren Buffett.  Oh, if you have a perfect sheet?  A perfect sheet.  He'll give you $1 billion.  Billion dollars.  A billion dollars.  But it's impossible.  It's pretty much impossible.  Never been done.  No, I guess it's like quintillion or something. 
[02:08:00]  It's in the one in some odd quintillion odds of actually being able to do that.  So he's an asshole.  Right.  Buffett's just an asshole.  We could have done that same bit.  Yeah.  We're giving away a billion dollars for the perfect bracket.  I got him once.  Did your wolf help pick him out?  No, I guessed him right.  Oh, yeah.  You just guessed him.  Yeah.  It's a deduction.  Good job.  Yeah.  And then, of course, Obama has to pick out his brackets because nothing else is going 
[02:08:30]  on as fucking...  We got to follow his brackets.  As Putin's goose-stepping his way across Eastern Europe.  You got to let him.  They're saying...  Yeah, I don't care.  They're saying that's like Canada fighting with the United States.  Yeah.  That's how ridiculous the situation is over there.  It's crazy.  With Crimea.  It's Crimea.  Crimea.  Crimea.  They just annexed it.  Russia's like, yeah, they want it.  They want to be part of Russia, don't you? 
[02:09:00]  And, you know, we'll send in a few soldiers and everything.  See?  You do, right?  And they pretty much voted and decided, yeah, we want to be Russian.  But, you know, the Ukraine's sitting there going, hey, this is part of our shit.  Right.  You know, that's like Mexico taking Texas.  Right.  Mexico takes Texas and says, no, it's ours now.  Right.  That's what they're saying.  And we'd be pissed off at that.  Sure.  And then he got to wonder if they're going for New Mexico next.  Oh, boy.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  Turn out to be a problem.  Could be a problem.  But now, Jimmy doesn't want us to get involved.  We're concerned.  No, it's not our business.  And I agree 100%.  There's nothing we really can do either.  I would love for Putin to bring back the Soviet Union.  Absolutely.  Just bring it right back to the way it was.  We have our one big enemy back again.  And all this little peripheral shit, they could just shut up.  And the rest of the world who hates us now can suck our dicks.  Gentlemen.  Look at this.  Sirs.  Fucking feds. 
[02:10:00]  Important people in studio right now.  They just came here to see Lady Di.  Yes, that's in her comments.  It was very funny, actually.  Well, what happened?  Well, last night I got a text.  It's pretty much just like, I'm going to stop in tomorrow.  I want to see that fucking retard.  Jesus.  She's a big star.  Oh, a big star.  I'm looking for my wolf permit.  Oh, shut up.  They're not looking for your wolf permit.  Rick Harrison is a little late. 
[02:10:30]  So why don't we get Lady Di to show the items that she's got up?  Ooh.  That'd be good.  I would like to see what...  Can we get Lady Di in here really fast?  What she thinks is going to get some cash.  I've seen people walk away with tens of thousands of dollars.  Right.  When they come into the Pawn Stars place.  And it's amazing.  You know, it's just some crap.  It's like, oh, I bought at a garage sale for ten bucks.  Oh, it's worth, you know, five grand. 
[02:11:00]  Holy shit.  And do we have any experts?  Because I know sometimes Rick has experts come in and looks it over.  Because sometimes he's like, I don't know what to offer you.  I know a guy.  I think we could be the experts.  We could be the experts.  Yes.  I know a guy.  He'll come down and check it out.  All right.  Here.  Look at her.  She looks scary when she's walking down the hall.  She really looks frightening.  With that makeup from Saw.  We figured her face kind of looked like the Saw dummy thing.  So we just decided to make her up like the Saw dummy. 
[02:11:30]  Dummy thing.  And she really does look like, oh, hey.  It just goes, oh, hey.  All right, Lady Di.  To hear about your comments.  Come on.  Take a seat there, Lady Di.  We've got Rick Harrison coming in from Pawn Stars.  You watch Pawn Stars, Lady Di?  Yeah, that I watch.  Oh, you do?  You do watch.  That's on basic cable.  Were you talking to the microphone?  You've been here all week.  They have all antiques on that show. 
[02:12:00]  I mean, old, old things.  Clothes are a big seller, too.  They have a lot of weird things with weird, hard-to-get clothes and stuff.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was the weirdest thing.  I threw out all my old concert shirts.  I'm like, those are worth thousands of dollars.  Really?  Some of these weird shirts.  You know, if I had my concert shirts.  Or any kind of shirts.  I had a lot of Billy Joel shirts.  Those are very valuable.  Those are huge.  Those are extremely valuable.  And what else did I have?  Those are big, yeah.  Especially in XL.  Yeah, wait, wait.  Wait a minute.  I had Elton John's shirts.  Oh, yes. 
[02:12:30]  I do imagine Rick from Pawn Stars going like, the Billy Joel shirt.  Look, I'll give you $15,000 for this.  I know you probably want $25,000.  I even have an old, I had an old monkey shirt.  Oh, yeah?  A real old one from when they first came out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you show everybody what you brought in today?  Yeah, let's see.  To have Rick Harrison.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Before you do that.  Hold on.  Put it back.  Look at this Pepto in the bag. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  You've seen every show.  So what are some of the items has Rick Harrison got excited over?  Oh, it's amazing.  Like old posters, artwork, he likes that.  Things from like, original things from Woodstock kind of thing.  Ooh, okay.  Military memorabilia.  He loves things like that.  Okay.  But I did see somebody came in with the original denim blue jeans from like the 70s even, and  that was worth a lot of money.  That was worth money, too.  Yeah, so clothing can be worth money. 
[02:13:30]  Also, I've seen weird shirts.  The highest bit I actually saw on that show was some weird offbeat t-shirt.  It didn't seem like it'd be worth much.  It was like the oddest stuff.  Yeah, because people don't collect them.  Wow.  So the ones that fall through the cracks are worth a lot of money because they're rare.  And Lady Di, you brought some things in, and you could use the money, so this could be good.  Yeah, all right.  Which one is coming in today?  The guys.  Kevorkian.  The main guy.  Rick Harrison.  Which one is the main guy?  Rick is the guy right next to the guy with the hat.  You know, the one that's front center.  The bald guy.  See, there's the old man, which is the grandfather, and Rick's father. 
[02:14:00]  And there's Rick.  And then there's his son.  And then there's Big Hoss.  And then there's Chumley.  Okay.  Who, by the way, you look a little like Chumley.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Just saying.  Did we lose Chumley?  I don't know what to say.  No, that was a hoax.  Oh, okay.  I thought so.  I used to have all kinds of old things.  Well, show us what you brought in today.  What?  Let's see what you brought.  Someone said Lady Di looks like John Wayne Gacy.  Dale Earnhardt Jr. hat. 
[02:14:30]  Hold on, guy.  Number eight, which he doesn't drive anymore.  Right.  Oh, wow.  He doesn't drive the number eight car.  The junior one is really, because Dale Earnhardt Sr. is very popular.  The juniors, they made, I want to say, like 50 of them.  Yep.  And there was a problem.  And so there's very, very few of those, because they weren't popular.  So that's a rare item.  Big item right there.  Yeah.  NASCAR.  Big item.  NASCAR Racing.  That's absolutely an original.  How much do you think you could get for that? 
[02:15:00]  Well, give us a number.  What are you thinking?  All right.  Okay.  What do you want to do, pawn it or sell it?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  $200.  $200 for the hat.  You'll get more than that.  All right.  All right.  $200.  You'll get more than that.  $200 for the junior hat.  No, don't say $200.  Don't say $200.  Let him say it.  If you want $200.  No, he'll ask you, how much do you want for it?  Right.  But if you want $200, you don't say $200.  You say $500.  $500?  He's for a hat?  Because then he's going to go down and say, now, all right, $200. 
[02:15:30]  And then you go, no, $300.  So you might get $250.  All right.  All right.  I'll try that.  But I don't know.  You chew him down.  I don't know.  Right.  I'll chew him down.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We got another person from Elizabeth, New Jersey checking in with a Lady Di sighting.  Uh-oh.  Dave, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Dave.  Welcome aboard.  It was Tuesday.  I went to Bayway Liquors where I saw this monster online without underwear.  She smelled like shit.  Oh.  She was chasing everybody out of the store.  That's not true.  That's not true, sir. 
[02:16:00]  Did you go there with your diapers on?  No, I did not.  No, I was trying to think.  No, I did not.  I didn't go there Tuesday.  Uh-huh.  You didn't park in the parking lot across the street from the school and have them carry  your beer for you?  No.  That monster?  Why the anger?  I don't understand.  No.  She's in bad shape.  Why the anger?  You did say somebody carried your beer out.  Yeah.  Well, that was the person that works there.  But that's what this guy said.  Yeah.  You brewskis.  I was standing right behind her.  It smelled like cabbage and shit. 
[02:16:30]  Jesus.  Wow.  First of all, I didn't have any corned beef and cabbage.  And second of all, I have no idea what you're talking about.  The vice president of MrPoint.com.  I have no idea.  And I wasn't there on Tuesday.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  I don't know.  All right.  What's your next item for Pawn Stars?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Uh-huh.  I was there Tuesday.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, I was there Monday.  I was there Monday.  No, you were there Tuesday.  You said you spent your money.  Yes, that's true. 
[02:17:00]  We gave you for your panties.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Tuesday.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, okay.  So after all that, you were there Tuesday.  And you ate cabbage.  No, I did not.  Really.  Remember I wasn't hungry?  No, I remember that was Chicken Fingers at TGI Fridays.  And I don't park in the school parking lot.  I park in the Bayway Flickers parking lot.  Oh, easy.  So I don't know where the sky is going.  That's hilarious.  Easy, Chief.  All right.  What's your next item?  Next item.  Up for bid.  Oh.  What's she got?  Oh.  We said to bring in the valuable stuff.  Is that a Ron Jeremy shirt?  Yes, it is. 
[02:17:30]  Wow.  Wow.  That's...  A vintage Ron Jeremy shirt for adults only on the back.  Spiced rum.  That, show everybody else, is a mint condition, original...  Jim Mint 10.  Spiced rum shirt.  I knew what that was the minute I saw the top.  Oh, you did.  When you go on eBay, I've seen that selling for $6,000 because...  That's a lot of money.  Because it was one of those things that because he's in pornography, nobody wanted to carry  the shirt.  So they made them and they burned them. 
[02:18:00]  Wow.  How did you get it?  That was in pornography.  Hey, how did you get that?  It was a moral...  It was a promotion from the liquor store.  Yeah, if that was just a shirt, but the fact is, and it says Ron DeGeremy, it's a whole  special promotion thing.  I showed that on eBay for $6,000 and it wasn't even in this kind of condition.  So you could get at least...  That's mint.  At least a couple thousand today.  Yeah.  At least.  I would ask for...  Five?  Probably five.  No, you asked for more.  I've seen it on eBay for six.  Well...  Hmm.  Yeah, but he's got to make money also. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Hmm.  You know.  Let me see that.  What do you think, Lady Di?  I'd be very careful with that.  Lady Di, that's good news.  What do you think?  Yeah, for adults only.  That's the problem.  Nobody wants to be...  This was a bootleg shirt that was done by these rum people.  They used Ron Jeremy's image and the promotion people did it, but the rum did not want to  be associated because he's a pornographer.  There's a weird stigma with porn.  Yeah.  So just fold it up nicely.  All right.  Okay.  But that's why it's such a rare item. 
[02:19:00]  I'd ask for five.  Six grand.  Actually, Ron Jeremy gave it to me.  Wow.  Oh, okay.  That's probably why he had one.  One of the people that is associated with him, you know, was...  Follow me down the aisle, and he just gave it to me.  He says, here, here's a shirt for you.  Wow, that's cool.  I'd ask for five grand.  Yeah, careful folding that thing.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Don't mess it up now.  That way he can put it in his shop.  He took that in good condition for like 7,000.  Are you willing to give that up today?  Sure.  I don't wear it.  All right.  What else you got in the bag?  That's it. 
[02:19:30]  No, I mean, that's it.  As far as...  That's it?  Jimmy.  Where'd Jimmy go?  You don't want to sell your Pepto-Bismol?  My bagel, my bagel with cream cheese, and my Pepto-Bismol.  You brought a t-shirt and a hat.  Just in case.  All right, and that's card.  They're both rare, though, because you have the Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the Ron Jeremy with the spiced rum.  So ask for $500 for the hat, and then $5,000 for the shirt. 
[02:20:00]  You're not going to get $500 for the hat.  You might get $300.  I think you can get more than $5 G's for the shirt.  Anthony's saying ask for $5 G's.  You want to quick sell on that, I think.  If you ask for more, you can ask for $6,500, and then go down to $5.  It's stupid, but that's true.  All right, I'll ask for $6,500.  What do I got to lose?  And these are the most valuable things you had at your house.  Yeah.  You know, I also have a Michael Nesmith poster.  What?  You know what?  Why did you bring that in?  I decided not to let it go. 
[02:20:30]  A signed poster for Michael Nesmith.  Whoa, that's huge.  That's a lot of cake right there.  I paid for that.  I think I paid $40 for that.  That's a lot of cake right there.  And I just decided not to bring it in because, you know.  They're amazingly rare signed because he doesn't sign.  You're a loss.  Michael Nesmith doesn't sign.  Well, he signed.  I know, but that's why that's rare.  He's notorious for not signing.  He won't sign.  And I even, wait, hold on.  I even asked the person that was selling the posters.  I said, are you sure this was signed by Michael Nesmith?  Did you see him sign these posters? 
[02:21:00]  And he goes, yes, they are.  Yeah, because he would never say no and then try to sell it.  That would be silly.  Well, he sold it at a concert.  It's a certificate of authenticity right there.  Yeah, that's all you need.  He sold it at the concert.  He sold it at the concert.  Sure he did.  I'm sure his word is good.  The same place I got the shirt, Opie.  Oh, so you bought that signed poster at the concert from a guy, but he promised.  Yeah, he promised.  He promised me that it's a...  Oh, I thought you saw Michael Nesmith sign it.  No, I did not see him sign it.  I asked the guy that was selling the posters there.  Gotcha.  Yeah, and the guy would never lie.  And just one more thing.  This person is Michael Nesmith. 
[02:21:30]  What do you call it?  He works for Michael Nesmith.  Oh, he does.  So in other words, they go around, you know, concerts and everything like that, and they  sell these things.  So, you know, it had to be a Michael Nesmith poster.  Yeah, it had to be.  Sure.  You know, signed by him.  Who told you he worked for Michael Nesmith?  Well, I just know that because, you know, he was in the theater with the other people  that were selling the, what do you call it, the t-shirts and stuff.  So they're associated with Michael Nesmith. 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  All right.  Well, we got Rick coming up in a couple minutes here.  He's downstairs.  Oh, he is.  He just got here?  Yeah.  It's a little late.  Yeah.  Should we do a quick break?  Yeah, because I want to see Diane make some money.  All right.  It's good for you, Diane.  We'll do a quick break.  Quick break.  Rick Harrison from Pawn Stars.  Next.  Yeah, that's what we have to do.  Where's Rick?  I don't know.  What the?  We've been kind of like just stalling.  Yeah.  Stalling to find Rick. 
[02:22:30]  Rick Harrison from Pawn Stars.  Let's see.  I think that's what we do.  You got it?  All right.  We're back.  It takes everyone else like fucking an hour to get that pad on there.  Oh, we've been at it a while.  Yeah.  Will you shut up?  Oh, God.  She's just.  I'm at that point.  She's rambling on without a microphone.  I'm at that point.  Are you guys going to come out with another CD?  Yeah, it's 20 years in the making.  20 years in the making.  We're like Boston. 
[02:23:00]  Right.  Takes forever to come out with a second album.  Oh, just wondering.  That's all.  I'll buy it.  Oh, you wonder.  Oh, you will.  Thank you.  Sure, I will.  Nice to know.  Maybe we'll put that up on the podcast or CD.  Maybe we'll do that.  Yeah.  Hey, I didn't know you guys were on the air.  That's why I was.  That's why I pulled the microphone.  Just talking into microphones.  I think I hit my limit with this.  I hit my limit with this thing.  You did?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You got one more day.  It hit like an hour ago.  And it was done, right? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Totally.  Yeah, I started feeling like, ah.  Totally.  I'm surprised.  I thought it would have happened yesterday.  I was thinking sooner, too.  I think it officially happened today.  If she wasn't in such bad shape.  Right.  It probably would have.  I feel better.  I feel better about her being in really bad shape, though, because she doesn't feel like  listening to anyone.  So now I'm good.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm good.  What do you mean?  I mean, I know I'm heavy and everything, but, you know. 
[02:24:00]  Heavy.  Yeah.  You're dying from alcoholism, but you don't want to listen.  But I feel okay with that now.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I went from I don't care to caring a lot to, oh, okay.  Yeah.  She doesn't want to hear it.  I think that's what happens with people, right?  You're heavy?  No, I'm skinny, okay?  Because you are a disgusting fat body, private pile.  Didn't he say he was heavy?  I'm heavy, sir. 
[02:24:30]  Is he here?  We're just stalling here, Roland.  Come on.  Bring him in.  He's a half hour late.  I know he's a big star.  Bring him in.  There we go.  That's the guy.  Of course that's the guy.  Thank you.  I'm glad you're verifying.  You're verifying the guy.  I'm glad you're verifying.  Rick.  There he is.  How are you doing, sir?  How are you doing, sir?  How are you doing, man?  Big star in studio.  What's up, sir?  There he is.  How's it going?  Pleasure, buddy.  Pleasure.  Take a seat right over there.  We're actually on the air.  Yeah.  Okay.  We do it that way.  I watch Pawn Stars a lot.  Oh. 
[02:25:00]  I do.  Perfect reaction.  Rick just looks over and Lady Di and...  Perfect reaction, sir.  She's been our paid intern for the past week.  And she's dying from alcoholism.  It's been a joy.  It's been a treat, a joy, and a pleasure.  That's all I need to know.  I just don't know what to say.  It's okay.  It's all right.  So Rick Harrison, of course, from Pawn Stars.  Pawn Stars, when's the new season starting?  Well, my seasons don't end anymore.  They don't.  It's just one continuous...  Literally, I am on 52 weeks this year. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  52 weeks.  Yeah.  Wow.  I love the show.  I've probably seen every episode since the beginning.  I haven't seen one of them.  You haven't watched any of them, huh?  No, it just completely weirds me out to watch myself.  Does it really weird you out?  Yeah.  You did...  God, we talked with...  You did an episode of Insomniacs.  Oh, yeah.  Way back.  It was like 2003, 2004.  Yeah.  Was that your first foray into television as far as... 
[02:26:00]  No.  For lack of a better term, I have always been a media whore.  Uh-huh.  Okay, so...  Oh, you're doing it right.  No, I got PBS to do a documentary on me.  I was always getting on some kind of news.  Yeah.  It's because I put World Famous on the side of the building years ago.  Just out of nowhere.  Well, yeah.  People used to say, why is it World Famous?  I said, because it says so on the side of the building.  That's great.  That's a great...  Excuse me, Rick.  Oh.  Yes?  Yes?  I'm not dying of alcoholism. 
[02:26:30]  Poor Rick.  I'm just scared.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  I'd be.  She's wearing the saw puppet makeup.  That's Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  Hi.  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy Norton.  What do you mean?  Oh, you did?  Oh, you did?  Oh, by the way, by the way, Rick.  In Vegas, when David Tell was doing a...  Oh, right.  Yes, he was doing me and David.  Leave the guest alone.  She's tapping him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nice meeting you, too.  How about you leave the studio for a few minutes?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we did the David Copperfield Theater.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So you guys have met. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  What did you do on Insomniac?  It was my pawn shop.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, Tell came in.  And it was late at night, too.  Well, it's a 24-hour pawn shop.  Right, right.  But I guess for the most part, the show is based during the daytime hours.  Yeah, it gets a little weird at night.  Yeah, at night it got a little weird.  I mean, it's just you're in a bad place if it's 2 a.m. on Sunday and you need money.  You should go home.  Yes, yes, yes.  You should probably go home.  But that would be great to see, the weirdness at night.  It probably would be, but it's... 
[02:27:30]  It's probably a lot darker than you want the show to be.  Yeah, I got a family show.  Uh-huh.  Right, right, right.  What are some of the things they bring in in the middle of the night?  Everything.  I mean, usually it's jewelry.  Right.  And they just want to keep on going.  How much of the stuff that people bring in as far as jewelry goes is fake as far as...  Half of it.  Half?  It's absolutely great when they walk in.  And it's not always necessarily fake, too.  I mean, when a girl brings in a diamond ring or grandma's diamond ring, her whole life she's 
[02:28:00]  heard it's like this perfect diamond.  And I go, no, grandpa was cheap.  Oh.  This is bad.  Oh, no.  And they don't want to hear that, man.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no, no.  I am the big bleep, bleep, bleep.  Right.  It's serious.  They don't bleep.  Yeah, they don't bleep.  You can say whatever you want here.  Not only are you not giving them the money, you're just ruining their fucking lineage.  Yeah.  Cheap grandpa.  Shitting on their heirlooms.  You're a big war buff, too.  Like, war memorabilia.  Yeah, I'm a complete history nerd. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, history nerd.  But I notice you steer clear of any Nazi memorabilia.  Yeah, just nothing with any bad mojo.  It's just a little weirdness.  Is that because of, like, a karma thing?  Yeah, it's just karma, dude.  I mean, it's just like a creepy shit associated with that.  Yeah, yeah.  And rock, you like rock memorabilia, too.  I see.  Yeah, I like a little.  I just like anything that's cool and fun.  I mean, I got everything.  I got pictures of Jimi Hendrix hanging out of my house, and I have 800-year-old maps. 
[02:29:00]  A lot of times, when people bring in those old maps, like from the 1600s or something,  I'm thinking they'd be worth more than they are.  How much are they worth?  Well, from the 1600s, anywhere from, like, $100 to $20,000, $30,000.  I would think anything from the 1600s would be worth more than $100.  And that's what a lot of people think, because it's old that it's worth something.  Well, yeah, people are saying that it's old, it's worth something.  I got three million-year-old rocks in my backyard.  I can't give away this. 
[02:29:30]  And a firearms buff, also.  Yeah, I love my guns.  I live in Nevada.  We can own anything.  Well, you probably have to be armed there, because you're working.  You know, everyone knows you got cash there, so you're probably smart to be armed.  Yeah, that's, my pawn shop's never been armed, and that's because half my employees have  a bulge on the side of their, underneath their shirt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I see what you're talking about.  Okay.  Absolutely.  Yeah, Vegas is great.  I was out there a few months back, and I went to one of the places to rent some fully automatic  guns.  It's just a pisser, man. 
[02:30:00]  What a blast.  It's the greatest city in the world.  I was 28 years old down in L.A. before I ever knew what the word's last call meant.  I was literally, I was like, 28 years old.  I'm like, what do you mean the bar closes?  Right.  Yeah.  Were you born and raised?  No, I moved there when I was 16, and lived there ever since.  I've lived there for, what, like 15, 8 years?  No, no, 33 years.  Were you traveling around a lot, because of your pops being in the Navy?  No, my dad had some really good gigs in San Diego, refused promotion and everything. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, wow.  Because in the late 60s, early 70s, he was the first guy you saw when you got transferred  to San Diego.  And the first words out of my dad's mouth is, well, son, you bought a house yet?  And he goes, no, we'll go see my wife.  So my mom was selling like 30, 40 houses a month, because he had this one gig in the  Navy.  Oh, he wasn't going nowhere.  That's perfect.  Wow.  Wow.  What an arrangement.  Yeah.  That's really nice.  So how did you guys then get into, the family get into the pawn business? 
[02:31:00]  Well, like that whole Jimmy Carter thing happened.  My dad had a lot of real, was doing a lot of stuff in real estate in San Diego back in  the late 70s, early 80s.  Everything went completely.  Yeah, yeah.  Just one day he walks away, we're moving to Vegas.  Wow.  The land of milk and honey.  That quick.  Damn.  And then there's got to be a lot of competition in the pawn business, especially in Vegas.  Yeah, especially there.  In the pawn business, no, they're really, really limited on the licenses there. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  I lucked out when I was 23.  I found a little flaw in the city code, and I got mine.  Before that, the last one sold before I got mine, I think, was $600,000 for the license.  Mm-hmm.  That was back in the 80s.  Man.  Wow.  When you're buying stuff, because people are coming in, your job is just to buy it, and  if you like it.  But do you ever see people and go like, ah, God, I feel almost bad for this person because  their desperation is what's...  No.  No, you don't.  Not at all. 
[02:32:00]  He's...  No, he's all...  No, but that's an interesting thing.  You have to, I guess, think that.  Well, a pawnbroker with a heart is a pawnbroker out of business.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I hear a million sad stories.  I mean, I've worked at the graveyard shift at the pawn shop plenty of times, and I've had  them come up, and I need food for the baby, and then an hour later, I need diapers  for the baby, and I need medicine for the baby.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And then baby needs a new pair of shoes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You just, you don't know if it's true or not, and you don't care. 
[02:32:30]  You know, the thing is, when it comes down to it, it's just stuff, and it's business.  Yeah, yeah.  You, obviously, Vegas, a lot of people, they're gambling.  They're losing their money.  People gambling, it's a, it's a, it's a weird town.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I get a lot of people coming in there.  This is where people go to retire.  Yeah.  So, I get people, kids from out of town saying, grandma, grandpa just passed away, they got  all this stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, who really eats with silver flatware anymore? 
[02:33:00]  No, no one.  So, you get rid of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Frank, have you, have you seen, she just, it was rambling on, I'm trying to talk with  Rick.  You're a big fan.  You've seen every episode.  I've seen every episode.  I love the show, and this, she's just babbling on and on about God knows what.  So, if you're an intern, what university do you go to?  What?  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:30]  Excuse me.  Excuse me, Rick.  She goes to a swollen liver U.  Excuse me.  I'm a fan of the show.  Okay.  Okay.  I have a hat to sell.  Okay.  All right.  Can I show it to you?  Sure, go ahead.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  This is a very rare hat.  All right.  Do you buy hats?  NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt Jr., number eight.  Say something about it, guy. 
[02:34:00]  He doesn't drive the eight car anymore.  Oh.  That's why it's...  So, what can you tell me about it?  It's a really nice hat, and I bought it a few years back.  Okay.  Do you know who owned it before you did?  Nobody owned it.  It was brand new.  So, this is your sweat.  Ugh.  Just a thought.  Nobody really ever had to wear the hat.  I was in the bedroom for a long time.  Right.  So, then I don't want to know what these stains are, then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You probably don't if it's been in the bedroom. 
[02:34:30]  I'd say priceless.  Really priceless.  Priceless.  That's good news.  Wow.  Wow.  How much do you want?  Tell him.  Tell him how much you want.  I wanted $750.  $750.  He's not the number eight anymore.  I know.  He's number 88 right now.  He don't even drive the butt car anymore.  He drives a national bar.  You should get $750 for that.  So, you know.  Okay.  You want to throw a counteroffer at her?  No, I don't want to. 
[02:35:00]  That's about it.  All right.  You got the other item.  Well, now you got the big item.  I tried.  I tried.  I tried.  Now you got the big item.  She started with a small item, Rick.  All right.  Here's the big item.  This is a good one.  Careful.  Careful handling it.  Careful handling it.  Don't get any makeup on it.  Oh, geez.  Watch.  Here's a...  What?  Oh, no.  What?  Don't blow your offer.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  It's a Ron Jeremy Spiced Rum T-shirt. 
[02:35:30]  It's an original.  Rick's just shaking his head.  Well, what can you say about the shirt?  Tell us about the shirt, Lady Di.  It was never worn.  Uh-huh.  Brand new.  Okay.  That's probably a good thing.  He was promoting rum.  All right.  Okay.  At a liquor store.  And, you know, never worn.  It's rare, right?  And Ron Jeremy was the one that actually gave out these shirts.  Right, right, right.  Oh, okay.  That's a big one.  Actually, a few years ago at the Mixed Martial Arts Awards, I actually gave out an award with  Ron Jeremy. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, okay.  It was for the best equipment.  It was.  Hey.  We've all seen him use his.  So, Lady Di, first of all, you're looking at pawn it or sell it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  You want to pawn it or sell it?  What do you mean pawn it or sell it?  Oh, God.  How much do you want for it?  $7,500.  Give me a buck.  $7,500.  $7,500 for the shirt.  I'll give you a dollar. 
[02:36:30]  A dollar?  Nah.  Okay.  She's going to keep it.  So much for that.  Check around.  Isn't it sad when the people have to leave with their item?  It happens.  It really is funny when these people are talking up their items, and it's a big, cumbersome  thing also.  What you don't see on the show, though, is so many people come back and say, oh, give  me the money.  And they say, yeah.  I assume that a lot of times. 
[02:37:00]  And the thing is, I say, well, can I get you on camera selling?  No.  No.  I've had it.  That's why on my show, you never see anybody pawning stuff.  They just sell stuff.  Right.  No one wants to admit they've got to pawn something.  That they're pawning something.  It's always saying.  Yeah.  Because you ask them all the time.  You want to pawn it or sell it?  And they're like, sell it.  Yeah.  I want to sell it.  People are broken it alone.  We found out, like, the first three days of filming the show, they don't want to be  on TV.  They don't want to be on TV.  Excuse me.  Excuse me, Frank.  Yeah.  Frank.  His name's Rick.  His name's Rick Harrison.  All right. 
[02:37:30]  Just remember what it rhymes with.  You'll never forget it.  Okay.  Sick.  Because she is.  No, no.  I'm not sick.  All right.  All right.  Now, at home, I didn't bring it in.  Okay.  I have a signed poster, Michael Nesmith.  All right.  How much would have that been worth?  Signed Michael Nesmith from the Monkees?  From the Monkees.  Yeah, from the Monkees.  You do, like, rock memorabilia.  Okay.  Oh, that's true.  So when did it get signed?  It got signed in November of last year.  Tell them how you know it was actually signed, too.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  It was at a Michael Nesmith concert.  Tell them how you know it was actually signed.  And the people, all right, I decided not to bring it in because I really don't want to  sell it.  Okay.  And the people that work for Michael Nesmith, that travel with him, one of them was the  poster person, and one of them was the t-shirt person.  And he told you?  Did you ask him if he was signed?  Yeah, but he told me.  Yeah, but he told me.  Did he give you a certificate of authenticity?  No, I didn't.  They told you that he signed it?  Wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  I think they were available.  I think the tickets were available, but it was more money, so I said, no, I just want 
[02:38:30]  the...  You had to pay for your certificate of authenticity.  Every single rock and roll band has a guy sitting backstage signing autographs.  I just want everyone to know that.  So unless you see every single Beto's photo, well, I gave it to a guy and he brought it  backstage and he signed it for me, and I'm going, I hope you didn't give a lot for this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  One more question.  Oh, oh.  All right.  All right.  I used to have...  I apologize to Rick.  Wait, wait, hold on. 
[02:39:00]  I used to have signed baseballs.  Oh.  Actually signed by the players.  Because I know, because I met them and then they signed a baseball...  How much would they have been worth?  How many Babe Ruth balls did you sign?  Yeah, it's like...  I'm going to ask that.  What players?  Derek Jeter, Joe Torrey, Jim Larritz.  Not a lot of Jeter out there.  Guys that are still alive next to nothing.  Yeah.  That's shit.  See?  Wait.  Yeah.  You got a Billy Martin?  Maybe a Thurman Munson?  There you go. 
[02:39:30]  No.  Luke Erick?  Michael Nesmith?  Ty Cobb?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Look, Roland's going nuts out there because he says Rick's got to go.  He's a very busy man today.  The closest I can get to that is a signed pitcher that was taken of Cleet Boyer.  Cleet Boyer?  What the hell are you talking about?  You have the best memorabilia.  He used to be a New York Yankee.  You have the best memorabilia.  Roland, what's the matter?  Yes.  He's got to go?  Yeah, because I've kept him with the time history.  How much for one of Bob Apodaca's used condoms? 
[02:40:00]  How much for one of those?  Oh, boy.  All right.  I'm glad I'm going right now, guys.  See you.  Rick Harrison from Plum Stars.  Thanks so much.  Rick Harrison.  It's very nice meeting you.  It's on History Channel.  History Channel Thursday nights.  Great, man.  At 9 o'clock.  Love the show.  Thanks so much.  Listen, the thing with the hat.  Listen, Rick.  No, he's got to go.  It's been a pleasure.  You guys feel like a picture with him?  Okay, okay.  All right.  Tell him.  What? 
[02:40:30]  Tell him.  Thanks so much.  Tell him.  This is your chance.  Tell him.  It's your chance.  Tell him.  Die.  Just tap him on the back.  It's his chance.  Tell him.  Tell him.  Well, here, here.  Wait a minute.  Oh, what?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What's the matter?  Die?  I just had to.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, okay.  He just waves her off like bad.  Thank you.  Aw.  He's shaking his head.  Oh, I was going to take my camera out.  Never mind.  You don't know how to do the picture thing with celebrities.  They're not going to wait for you.  You've got to like. 
[02:41:00]  Do it right away.  Right away.  Die.  Right away.  I think he liked you.  Do you want a picture?  Yeah, I wanted a picture.  Why don't you run her down and get her a picture?  Yeah, go get a picture.  Run her down towards the elevator.  Go.  Fast.  Run.  Run.  That's all she wants, a picture.  Go, die.  Go.  Go.  Hurry.  You take forever to do anything.  If it was a natty ice getting on that elevator, you'd fucking run.  Run, you motherfucker.  Run.  That's right.  Yeah.  Put me on a pay me no mind list.  Run.  Get my fucking drink.  Step and fetch it. 
[02:41:30]  Look at him.  She said she wanted $7,500 for a t-shirt.  With a complete straight face.  She held up that shitty.  A straight round face.  T-shirt.  That shitty t-shirt she got at a liquor store and told Rick Harrison she wanted $7,500 for  it.  Holy fuck, that was funny.  And $750 for the hat.  For the hat.  He didn't know what to think of her.  Oh, she was terrific.  He was horrified with her sitting next to him. 
[02:42:00]  Horrified.  Did you hear her talking while he was talking?  Yes.  Do you understand the dregs of society that come to pawn things in Vegas?  And he was horrified by her.  Travis has the clip so he can relive it.  Yes, Travis, please.  Yeah, what do you want to do?  Do you want to pawn it or sell it?  What do you mean pawn it or sell it?  How much do you want for it?  $7,500.  Give me a buck. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, is that fucking funny, man?  $7,500.  I love her fucking shitty Michael Nesmith poster story.  Some roadie sign.  Michael Nesmith is a cunt.  Nobody cares about him.  He's not signing it.  No, not at all.  I love it.  Did she get her picture?  Yeah, just barely.  Okay.  She couldn't run, so...  She couldn't. 
[02:43:00]  Was he happy to do it?  No.  Where's he going now?  I don't know, but they were in a rush to leave, and we yelled for him.  He turned around, sorry, and he just went...  Horrified.  But he was late coming here, man.  Yeah, I guess his whole schedule's off.  His schedule.  Oh, that's cute.  I'll put it up on O&A Show on Twitter.  Okay, good.  Here she is.  Hey, you got a picture, did ya?  Got your picture.  Put it up on Twitter as a ASAP.  I got to see it.  Yes.  Oh, where do I sit?  Right here, my dear.  In the chair of honor. 
[02:43:30]  The chair of honor.  No, I didn't get a picture with my camera.  It doesn't matter.  We'll get a better one with this one.  It's a high-res.  You don't need your shitty camera.  I love the...  You don't need your old lady purse.  The piercing look that he just made.  It's like, ugh.  All right, very good.  There you are.  Back where you belong.  Are you sure?  As our guest of honor, yes.  Yeah.  We...  We tapped out.  I look like Ace Frehley from Kiss or something with this makeup on.  I don't know.  Something like that.  What?  Yeah.  Not even close.  John Wayne Gacy's painting was a better one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's a really great artist.  All I need is a wig and some more paint. 
[02:44:00]  Well said.  I look like one of the guys with Kiss.  Wait.  Maybe the one that's going to be on that show, the VH1 show.  Right.  Yeah.  What's the name of it again?  Ace Frehley.  What VH1 show again?  Not Ace Frehley.  Peter Criss.  That guy.  Yeah, that metal show.  Whatever it was.  Yeah, the metal show.  The one I don't get.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Art in Pittsburgh. 
[02:44:30]  Art.  Hey, guys.  Although I don't know how you're pulling it off, I'm laughing my ass off, but it's time  to shut the cunt up.  Yeah, it finally hit me today.  I thought it would hit me yesterday, but it definitely hit me today.  I am right with you.  This has run its course.  I think another full week is necessary.  That is not happening.  Another full week of Lady Di.  I mean, we'll try to get through tomorrow.  Lady Di Week.  Right.  I have had...  Hopefully lesser time tomorrow. 
[02:45:00]  I feel so privileged.  Oh, what's the matter?  What's wrong?  Lady Di Week?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, okay.  Whatever.  That's what this has been.  What's wrong with that?  What's the matter?  There's nothing wrong with it.  It's just that...  You're getting a little agitated.  What's the matter?  Yeah, let's go to Kentucky.  You're a little agitated.  Mikey wants in.  You need a drink?  No.  No, I don't need a drink.  Get him a drink.  Mike.  Bad phone.  Oh, he's got one of those phones.  That's a bad phone right there, right?  Sure is.  Sounds like he's underwater.  Yeah.  What does?  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Might be one of your family members trying to communicate.  Oh, yeah.  What does that mean?  There's no krill here.  Right.  Frank, good morning on.  Frank, Frank.  I forgot his name again.  I'm trying to communicate.  I just know them by seeing them.  Who, what?  Oh.  I don't think you know much about that show.  When I flip the channels, sometimes I turn it on, especially when there's something interesting  that they want to...  Oh, like what?  What grabbed your interest one day? 
[02:46:00]  Yes.  Oh, boy.  A bug commercial.  Ah.  Like real old jewelry.  Right.  Yeah, I've never seen that.  Let me see.  What else?  What else?  It's been a little while since I saw the show.  Oh, sure, sure.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm trying to think right now.  We love holding on on the radio.  Sewing machine.  A real old one.  A sewing machine.  Yeah.  That stopped in your tracks as you were going around the dial, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  We like to use it for your lips. 
[02:46:30]  All right.  She said, I need something to take this makeup off.  Jimmy goes, how about a shotgun?  Fucking killed me all day.  Oh, my God.  A shotgun.  How many bathroom runs today for you?  I only had one bathroom run.  Actually, two.  Good for you.  That's it.  All right.  She's got to be taken out to Starbucks, though, remember.  No, I don't. 
[02:47:00]  What?  I'm all right.  You're using this bathroom up here?  I'm not using any bathroom.  I haven't used the bathroom at all.  Oh, go use our bathroom.  No.  Oh, go use.  What?  No?  I haven't used it at all.  Not allowed.  I didn't have to.  Okay.  Pepto-bismol.  Is that what you're doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's healthy.  No.  Well, you know, so this way you don't use the bath.  I ate, and I had a ginger ale, and then, you know, the Pepto-bismol.  And then what?  TGI Fridays after this?  No.  A little bit?  Oh, no.  Just for a couple.  No.  A couple of years.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:47:30]  I can't afford it.  When will you crack your first natty ice today?  Yeah.  As soon as Bill starts yelling at me.  Bill, her roommate, will start yelling at you.  He'll start yelling at you?  As soon as I walk in the door, you know, whatever.  Whatever he says.  What does he yell at you about?  Huh?  What does he yell at you about?  He'll just want to do that when she comes in.  That's true.  Yeah.  You know, so you walk in.  What could he possibly be mad about?  So what do I do when I...  Well, let me tell you something right now.  Uh-huh.  I avoid him when he does that.  Okay? 
[02:48:00]  It's like I block him out.  You're in a small hovel.  How do you avoid each other?  Oh, very easy.  Just go to the next room.  Yeah?  Yep.  Is there a TV in that room?  He's usually...  No.  He usually sits in the kitchen.  Okay?  And I'll go...  Awful existence.  Miserable man.  What's he do in the kitchen?  He watches TV.  Oh, in the kitchen?  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Well, yeah.  I picture him like Carl Childress and his father sitting in the chair.  We smoke outside.  We smoke outside.  The world will be shut of you soon enough.  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  And he...  No.  He just sits in the kitchen and watches my TV in the living room through a mirror.  Wait, wait, wait.  Watches...  Wait.  Hold on.  So everything's backwards.  And I'm like, how could you watch television in a mirror?  I know.  And he watches Jeopardy.  So he doesn't know what the categories are.  Right.  He watches, he watches, you know, the TV...  Watches baseball.  Why don't they always run to third?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right off the fucking...  How long has Jeopardy been a lefty?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  So he watches the TV through the mirror.  And then if he has something to say, he'll say it.  Into the mirror?  No, he'll tell me.  Oh.  Maybe it's because you're like Dracula and he can't see you in the mirror?  Long way to go for that.  It's a mean joke.  I was trying to think of a good vampire joke.  Let me ask you, though.  Why is he watching in the mirror and just sit in the kitchen?  What's he doing in the kitchen?  Nothing.  Just tug his prick?  Does he have a cup of coffee or something?  No.  Or his beer?  Well, he starts out with coffee and then he goes on to drink...  Can you picture a real 70s looking fucking kitchen set?  Slippers.  With like an ashtray from the Storks Club. 
[02:49:30]  And it's full of cigarette butts.  And he's just drinking in a wife beater tea.  Yeah.  Boxers.  He's looking in the mirror yelling at you.  What an existence.  Yeah.  Sounds fascinating.  Unless he goes into the bedroom and just goes to sleep for a little bit.  Passes out?  Yeah.  Well, no, he doesn't pass out.  He just goes in there and he just goes to sleep.  Does he ever leave the house?  Huh?  Does he leave the house ever?  Not lately.  No.  Why?  Bill's an agoraphobic.  Every once in a while he looks in the mirror and he thinks Gamma is in his house. 
[02:50:00]  He sends me out for everything.  Every time I come home.  You gotta go out.  You gotta go.  I don't like I going anywhere.  I just got home.  Do you realize you two enable each other?  Yep.  You two are enabling each other's fucking worst aspects of your lives.  He buys you beer.  He buys you fly.  That's right.  You get to buy all the night and ice you need and you're there for him to yell at and then  you're there to buy his beer for him and you're like this horrible cops type couple. 
[02:50:30]  He doesn't have a problem.  What?  He doesn't have a drinking problem.  He's a full blown alcoholic.  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  How much does he drink a day?  He claims he does not have a drinking problem.  How much does he drink a day?  I don't know.  About maybe five, six, sometimes seven.  A day?  A day.  He's a full blown alcoholic.  Well, he won't tell you that.  That's for sure.  He doesn't need to.  Five, six, seven a day. 
[02:51:00]  That's a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every day.  Yeah.  Well, that's the average too.  He probably goes higher than that on some days.  Perhaps more than that.  Well, you know, what can I tell you?  It's his life.  That's it.  Hopefully nothing.  Right.  That's the way he wants to live.  So, yeah.  I like your hair like that.  It looks like Schwarzenegger's hair in the first Terminator when he's taking his eye out  and there was that weird shit.  Oh, man.  What can I say?  You look good with that makeup, Lady Di.  Oh, please hope me. 
[02:51:30]  You do.  You look good.  Yeah.  Everybody be looking at me.  That's a new type of mullet.  They have the mullet, the skullet, all those things.  You have a dullet.  Okay.  I thought it was funnier.  She just goes, okay.  I said it.  Because she's dull.  Yes, I understand.  Her hair is dull.  I think her hair has a lot of bounce and luster today.  Bounce.  Oh, Christ.  It had more yesterday.  Yeah.  No, it's actually cleaner today than it was even yesterday.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know why. 
[02:52:00]  It was pretty greasy that first day.  Holy shit.  No.  It's like you washed your hair with bacon.  No.  No?  Well, no, no, no.  No, you didn't.  I just used regular shampoo.  No, I didn't wash my hair.  I didn't wash my hair with bacon.  No.  She hasn't done a lot of that.  No, she hasn't.  She does it on the phone.  Yeah.  More so than she does live.  All right.  We'll take a break and finish the show next.  The show.  Jimmy's going to Virginia Beach today.  Oh.  Yeah, I got Virginia tonight through Saturday.  Yeah.  Tampa, the 10th, 11th, and 12th. 
[02:52:30]  11th and 12th only.  Is that Lady Di's phone ringing?  Yeah.  New York, April 24th through 27th here at Carolinas.  That's your phone.  That's your phone.  It's not ringing anymore.  What's up, though?  We've got to grab it an hour later.  That's why phones work.  They ring and they just pause and wait for you to answer them.  She remembers the old days when people had house phones.  Right.  Just a phone in your house and you were told, let it ring 10 times.  Oh, right.  Just make sure that somebody can get there.  And sometimes after nine fucking rings. 
[02:53:00]  Marion.  Call her back.  Yeah, call that pig back.  What does Marion want?  Put her on speaker.  That's her.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  Watching her try to use a smartphone.  It's infuriating.  The phone is smarter than me.  That's right.  Exactly.  Self-deprecating truth.  Yeah.  Okay, got your headphone.  Unplugged rotary phone.  Yeah.  Marion calls.  Calling again.  Hi.  Hello?  Hey, you're on the air.  Hey.  What's my, hey? 
[02:53:30]  Pig.  She's jealous.  She's jealous Lady Di's getting on this airtime.  Yep.  She is very jealous.  Should we call her back after the break?  Yeah, Marion, we're going to call you back from the studio phone.  Hey, what's going on with her?  Oh, you're not going to believe it.  You are not.  Make sure you answer your phone.  You're not going to believe what Di did today.  Just pick up your phone.  We're going to call you in a minute or two.  All right.  Yeah, call him back.  Call him back.  All right.  Good cycle.  Hey, it's Lady Di.  Boston. 
[02:54:00]  Listen.  Listen, listen, listen.  She just, she has these conversations with Sam on mic while we're, while we're on.  Am I doing the after show?  If you want.  Man, we don't care.  I won't be listening.  I'm so shit.  Of course.  Okay.  We're on.  Putting in a little OT.  Yeah.  Doing the after show.  A little overtime.  A little overtime.  Trying to upload a quick video of Lady Di with Rick from Pawn Stars trying to get $7,500 
[02:54:30]  for a Rod Jeremy shirt.  Her dead fucking straight face.  He hated her.  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah.  Roland came in and said, Rick liked you and you and you, but did not like her.  Oh.  Aw.  Oh, well.  You can't please everybody.  He's seen some crazy people.  Someone would be nice.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That's just it.  He's seen plenty of crazy people, but.  Well, let's get Marion on the phone.  Marion.  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  I always have to pull my headphones off a little bit with her. 
[02:55:00]  Thank you.  That voice.  Why do you keep calling us?  No.  You called me.  No.  You called first.  Remember?  No.  Adrian called me because I wanted to ask Diana what she got for that t-shirt because I  had the same one.  Oh.  Well, she asked.  I didn't get it.  $7,500.  Right.  Diana, what'd you get?  Don't tell her.  You should have been here with your shirt.  Well, whatever it is, I hope you put it away.  Marion's got the St. Ron Jeremy shirt there, Jimmy. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, my God.  She wants to know what Di got for it.  And wants to know what Di got from Rick from Pawn Stars.  I hope you got something that's going to at least have some money in the bank for a little  while.  Well.  I think you could say that.  Yeah, definitely.  She did pretty good.  She scored pretty good on that shirt.  Was it five or four?  Five or four what?  $4,000.  Well.  She went in with an offer of $7,500.  That was a little high.  It was high. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, he was trying to, you know, I lost everyone out of steam in my thoughts.  I just realized who I was talking to.  I'm like, why am I trying?  I hope he got five for it.  $5,000 for the t-shirt?  What do you think it's worth?  About that.  Are you going to sell yours?  Wait, why do you think?  Hold on.  Very interesting, because you're pretty close.  Why do you think the shirt is worth $5,000?  Because it's signed by a porn star. 
[02:56:30]  Well, there you go.  And you know why?  Yeah, he's semi-retired now.  Right.  Right, retired porn stars.  You know, those are gold mines for autographs.  Marian, Marian.  Yes?  The shirt was not signed.  The bottle of rum was signed.  Well, yeah.  Well, he signed some of it.  And she drank that before she got out of the store?  I didn't buy a bottle of rum.  Oh, okay.  I'm not allowed to have anything like that in the house.  I bought the bottle of rum.  Yeah, you did.  But I'm not allowed to. 
[02:57:00]  Missed the point.  If I walked in with a bottle of rum, Bill would kick me out.  Why?  I bought the bottle of rum and it lasted me a long time.  Good.  It's all about you again.  Good.  Right back to you.  I'm just saying I'm not allowed to bring any kind of liquor like that in the house.  Why?  Hold on a second.  Marian wasn't finished talking about herself.  Go ahead, Marian.  More about your irrelevant story.  I don't know, but I cannot bring any liquor in that house.  Why not?  What happens?  Yeah.  Who's Bill to try to keep you from getting all liquored up?  All soused.  What happened?  I don't know. 
[02:57:30]  You know, he just doesn't want me buying, you know, bottles of liquor and bringing them  home.  Something must have happened.  Right.  No, he just doesn't want me to do it.  No.  So he's looking out for you.  He thinks beer is okay.  Yeah, he thinks beer is okay.  But, you know, any other liquor, he doesn't think it's okay.  So I just didn't buy it.  He probably knows you get really frisky when you drink hard liquor.  Like when he's sleeping.  You ever wake him up by like just pulling his boxers down and eating his ass?  He snores.  What? 
[02:58:00]  He snores.  How do you know?  Correction.  Correction.  Excellent.  Excellent interjection.  Marry, correction.  You both snore.  He doesn't snore.  I snore.  You snore.  That's what I heard.  These are one of those conversations.  These inane.  Well, let them talk for a little while.  Yeah, yeah.  You two just cash in.  We hate the listeners.  Yeah, how you doing?  Are you having fun with them?  Sure.  I always have fun with them.  Good.  I always have fun with those guys.  I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.  Yeah.  We are happy for you.  Tell them about your makeup.  Wait till you go home and see this makeup that I got made over. 
[02:58:30]  What'd you do?  You'll see.  I'll see you on the computer later.  Yeah, then you're going to call me up and say, how'd you let him do that?  I already know.  Ooh.  Well, you know what?  You did a pretty show.  You're having fun.  You had to find a little week.  And you know what?  You guys are going to have her back next week, right?  Yes.  No.  No, no, no.  We're not.  Make it a two week.  Make it a two week.  I promise we will not have her back.  The listeners are loving it, though.  The listeners are digging it.  I'm finally listening to that.  Make it a two week.  No.  I'm finally listening to that. 
[02:59:00]  Maybe I wasn't listening yesterday, but I'm all in now.  No, this is not continuing past tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  I bet you she's boosting your rating.  We don't get ratings.  That's why I call it in every day.  I bet you she's boosting the reviews.  Reviews?  What reviews?  What reviews are you thinking of?  Reviews.  Is Walter Winchell going to talk about it?  The reviews on Facebook and Twitter.  I can hardly wait until I get on that train and see all these reviews that I'm getting. 
[02:59:30]  So, let me tell you.  She's having a good time.  And you know what?  Let me tell you something.  She's one of the better guests.  And what happened to Bobo?  Bobo, you didn't ask Bobo to come up this week.  Listen to this train wreck of thought.  Yeah, it really is just a tongue and teeth fighting.  I think she's a bit jealous.  A little jealous.  A little jealousy.  A little jealous.  I could hear the jealousy in your voice, Mary, and that you are a little jealous.  Sandy has called them.  All right.  Not this week, anyway.  I hope she's okay, wherever she's at. 
[03:00:00]  I hope she's dead.  No.  Who?  Sandy Kane.  Oh, I know you're at home.  She's a very nice person.  No, don't say that.  Oh, you guys are back for now.  Oh, shut up.  All right.  So.  Yeah.  Oh, it just goes on and on.  You didn't tell me, I'll be in Anthony, you ain't having fun with Diane this week.  It was kind of fun for the first two days.  The first of two weeks.  This is going to be great.  No, it's not happening.  That would not happen, no way.  Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, you'll have a play.  Maybe you'll have a back next week, and I hope you do. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, maybe I'll stick Wolfie on her.  Whoa.  You didn't have a Wolf.  Hey.  That's up to those guys.  That's it.  I read three plays, and everything else is good.  Yeah.  And I'm glad that you're having fun, Diane.  Right.  Thank you.  And you know what?  I got a phone number.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  I got a phone number from a cab company, because I did ask for a job, you know, being a cab driver.  Well, they remembered you as the dispatcher in taxi.  Maybe they can hire you part-time. 
[03:01:00]  Maybe they can hire you part-time to do this.  Yeah.  Four days a week?  Four days a week?  Think about it, Opie and Anthony.  You have Diane answering the phones and doing all the stuff.  No, that ain't happening.  We have interns do that.  Oh, doing tasks.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  We have interns that do that.  Yeah.  You got to give them a part-time job.  No, that ain't happening.  No.  Think about it.  No, I'd rather have her driving a cab.  Okay.  Oh, no.  What?  What about when you guys do road shows?  We can come with you.  We haven't done a road show in over a year.  I know you haven't done a road show in over a thousand years. 
[03:01:30]  But, you know, at least I could, you know, come with you guys and help you out.  I'm surprised no one is annoyed by Marion's phone call.  Weird.  At this point, you would have a lot of people calling.  Oh, I know.  That's so strange.  I'm really liking her phone call this time around.  Yeah.  You would have the whole gang back.  What happened?  The whole gang would come back.  It'd be nice if the whole gang came back.  What are you talking about?  The people that used to go on your show years ago.  All right.  Well, they're long gone. 
[03:02:00]  Is anyone calling in about the other call?  No, they kind of like Marion this time around.  Oh, cool.  I'll talk to a couple fans.  No, Marion changed her tune.  People are really digging Marion on the phone right now.  What happened to Frenchie, guys?  Frenchie?  Whatever happened to Frenchie?  I don't know.  It didn't translate.  Put my C in your A.  Yeah.  It's like, um, not quite.  You know what?  He passed away, actually.  Hold on.  Um, okay.  While I'm on the air, all right?  Ask for a job.  Well, yeah.  Well, you know, I've been looking for a job. 
[03:02:30]  No, ask for a real job.  A real job.  Because I think you've shown a lot of people this week that you got your shit together.  So how do they get a hold of you if they want to offer you a real job somewhere close  to Elizabeth, New Jersey?  No way.  Frenchie died.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She don't care.  All right.  Um, um, what was I going to say?  Um, anybody that, uh, records the shows, if you could find the show, if you, wait,  a lot of people do.  Hold on.  John wants in.  Hold on, Marion.  Frenchie died, Marion.  John from South Carolina wants in. 
[03:03:00]  John died.  He passed away.  This is what I want to know.  Why is her face not on a poster?  And at the bottom says, do you qualify for disability?  Hmm.  Who are you talking about?  Whose face?  Yeah, whose face?  My face.  Ooh, he means Marion.  No, not my face.  I think they're talking about me, Marion.  Yeah.  I know they are.  But answer them.  Uh-huh.  Well, you should have stuck up for your friend of, uh, 80 years.  You can answer for yourself.  Yeah, he died of cancer.  It was really sad.  Frenchie.  Listen, French, uh, speaking of Frenchie. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, he's dead.  Well, okay.  Well, I don't know.  How would I know?  I'm telling you.  I know he's dead.  Oh, the poor guy.  All right.  Well, he's very much alive, I'm sure, someplace.  He passed away.  If anybody, if anybody has, um, uh, the, the audio to the show where we were in the  limousine before we went to that Philadelphia show.  What?  The audio, the audio.  When we were, when Frenchie, Frenchie, Marion and I were in the limousine.  We were in the limousine on the way to Philadelphia.  You're supposed to be asking for a job.  It was like the Kennedy limousine audio.  If anyone had. 
[03:04:00]  You're supposed to be asking for a job, not for audio.  When we did YSP.  Yeah, all right.  When we did YSP.  Right, okay.  I mean, I, I have the part when we open up for Rich Voss, but I don't have the part  when we were in the limousine.  You didn't open up for Rich Voss.  Yeah.  You didn't open up for Rich Voss.  Somebody got to have that.  You were the cartoon before the show.  That, hey, that's who you should have had in the studio.  Oh.  You consider me.  Rich Voss.  You, you, consider me.  Sounds like we have him on the phone.  Right.  You know, if you consider us a cartoon, we open up for Rich Voss.  But I, I, the, I wanted the one when we were in the limousine on the way to Philadelphia. 
[03:04:30]  All right.  Remember when, uh, you guys were talking to me?  I think Big Al has it.  Remember when you guys were not talking to me?  I think Big Al has it.  And you were talking to Marion.  I think Big Al has it.  I'm done.  Big Al.  I wasn't allowed on that show.  I don't know.  It was eight o'clock this morning for me.  I tapped out at eight.  Yeah.  Just totally tapped out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll go ahead.  And I apologize for that.  When I called earlier, she turned me into a alcoholic.  I'm a fucking heroin addict now.  Hang up on that bitch. 
[03:05:00]  I'm going to kill myself.  Marion, he don't like you.  Hey, you know what?  I win.  He's a heroin addict.  Keep shooting up, buddy.  Keep shooting up.  Let me go to Tom.  Keep shooting up.  What about cocaine?  Keep putting that up, you know, too.  Good one.  Let me go to Tom in Westchester.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  The shows have been unbelievably great this week.  But get these disgusting cunts off the radio.  Oh, wow.  Do you mean us?  Don't listen to it. 
[03:05:30]  That is not nice.  Oh, my God.  They can dabble all day.  Get the radio off.  Shut up.  You shut up.  Make me a motherfucker.  Make you.  Thank you, Marion.  Make me.  Come face to face.  You don't know where I'm at, but when I'm face to face, I put my fist down your throat  so goddamn far, we're going to know what the hell it is.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to go throw myself in front of a train right now.  Oh, that's insensitive.  That's insensitive.  I'm going to go tomorrow, right?  Oh, man.  Bye. 
[03:06:00]  No, I mean, some people are still enjoying this, though.  Bob is one of those people.  Bob in Georgia.  Bob?  Oh, God.  For the love of God.  Do one of two things.  Either get them off or at least put the Ropers theme music on in the background so we can  be entertained in some fucking way.  Please.  You'll love us.  You don't like their conversations?  You'll love us.  All right.  Andrew's got sound for you.  Andrew.  Callin' and callin' and callin' and marryin'.  These are fans of the show, aren't they? 
[03:06:30]  I know how to shut you up.  Remember you young, the N-word in that video with your who, kid?  That shut you right up.  Maybe you can shut your fucking mouth, okay?  Maybe you can shut your mouth.  I'm going to go to Elizabeth and beat the fucking piss out of you.  Where do you live?  I don't live by Bayway Liquors.  You know, I don't live nowhere near Bayway Liquors.  You're talking to the wrong person.  Blood by Liquors.  I'm not the one.  Maybe I'm worried a couple times.  No, why don't you?  Good comeback. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  She's full of the good comeback.  I'm speechless over here.  I don't know what to say.  Unfortunately, you're not.  All right.  You're lifeless.  Oh, help us, please.  Hold on.  One more.  Thank you very much.  I don't pay attention to these jerk-offs too much.  You know, damn it.  I'm having fun with this.  I know, but I don't pay attention to these phone calls. 
[03:07:30]  Fuck.  All right.  I think it's fun.  Lou, if you're still there, go.  Mary, you're a fucking disgrace to New Jersey.  Honestly.  Will you shut the fuck up?  Why don't you shut your mouth?  You're a disgrace.  You got a problem?  Don't turn your radio off.  She's good.  Why don't you fucking enable her and step over her?  You don't know me.  You don't know me, buddy.  The entire fucking state can fucking hear you.  You're a disgrace.  You're giving us a bad fucking name.  Shut your mouth.  You don't know me, okay?  Wait, wait.  Hold on. 
[03:08:00]  Marion, Marion, hold on.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Why don't you have us two come up one day?  All right.  Have us two come up one day and do our own radio show?  Like you did years ago.  Remember you did that years ago?  Sure.  Our own radio show.  Uh-huh.  Sounds great.  Maybe sometime next month, I...  Why not?  They're scheduling it themselves.  Do our own show for a little while.  How long is a little while?  Yeah.  How long of a show would you want to do?  Four hours?  Maybe two...  Yeah, well, like she said, two hours. 
[03:08:30]  One hour.  Could you imagine...  Well, one hour, whatever, you know.  One hour.  One hour.  You know, because you did that years ago, and we enjoyed doing that.  You did it?  You remember, don't you?  No, really.  Next time, I think.  You don't remember.  No, no.  I'm serious.  No, when they were on W&EW.  Oh, really?  And what did you talk about?  We took callers.  You know, we took callers, and we wouldn't answer their questions.  I don't remember this.  I don't remember this either.  Well, some people do, because you're on regular radio.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  What does that mean? 
[03:09:00]  You're not as popular now.  You're on regular radio.  You're on regular radio.  He's just barreling over anyone that's talking.  You go ahead, Marion.  You just.  Yeah, you go ahead.  I was just making a suggestion.  I don't know.  You just take the reins.  Yeah.  I was just making.  I think she waits to hear a voice, and then has to talk over it.  You talking to me?  No.  All right. 
[03:09:30]  Are Marion's mind panic triggers conversation?  Yeah.  Like, she'll hear a voice, and then I'll just go, talk down quickly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love you, too.  That was even before Jimmy was coming into the studio.  That was a long time ago.  Okay.  You know.  He remembers that.  Yeah, well.  It was only you two for a while.  Yes, it was.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  I'll let you go.  I'm lucky, Jim.  Lucky, Jimmy.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  Hold on, Marion.  Bye. 
[03:10:00]  Bye, Marion.  Talk to you later.  I say die and Marion all week next week together.  Yeah.  In the studio.  You are so lucky.  But she has to work, you know.  This has run its core.  One more day of this shit.  We're going to have to get back to work.  Yeah.  Imagine Marion and die all week.  See you later.  All right.  Love you, Anthony.  Love you.  Yeah.  Tons of love.  Tons of love.  Well, Marion, when you go on vacation, we could do that.  When they go on vacation, we'll take over.  Oh, God.  I thought she was kidding.  When you guys go on vacation, we'll take over for you. 
[03:10:30]  Bye, feds.  Bye-bye.  Call me.  I will.  Bye.  Call me.  All right.  Yeah, I will get our number for you.  Yeah.  Dogger in the ass.  I think he's going to email me or something.  I don't know.  Boy, go ahead and say it.  That Marion's a hunk of shit, huh?  I'm not saying it.  What are you talking about?  We're best friends.  I can't say anything about her.  She is a real fucking piece, right?  But she's so jealous of your attention.  She's all jealous of you.  She's not jealous of...  Nobody's jealous of anybody.  She's going to hone in on your fucking action here. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  No one's jealous of anybody.  That's okay.  What are you doing with that big, dumb fucking Squarebob sponge pants purse?  I hate a square...  My purse.  What can I tell you?  Squarebob sponge pants.  What are that faggot's name?  This purse has a compartment for everything.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Lady Di.  So how do they get a hold of you to give you a real job?  Because this has to end tomorrow.  It really does have to end tomorrow.  Email me.  All right.  What's your email?  Diana Orbani777 at gmail.com. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Seriously, we're trying to get her some kind of a job.  Yes.  I don't know.  So if anybody has someone they need evicted, just put her in the room with them.  Right.  Somewhere close to what?  Elizabeth?  Tweet me.  Yeah.  Well, I prefer being close to Elizabeth.  Of course.  Of course.  Yes.  You never know.  You know, tweet me or Facebook me or however you want to do it.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Looks like my mother.  I know.  This is getting exhausted, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's too bad you're not going to be here tomorrow.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I'll be here tomorrow, right?  Sure. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's up to you guys.  Jim Norton, luckiest guy in the world.  Yeah.  He gets to go on a plane.  Sit next to me and...  You worried about flying after all this weird flying shit?  I wouldn't be worried about flying over the Indian Ocean at this point.  I'm rooting for something to happen after this week.  And you're not going to be...  Jimmy, you're not going to be here tomorrow?  No.  Oh, okay.  I'm having my age treated.  Busy guy.  But they still say flying is really safe.  Okay.  It is.  I know.  Safer than walking.  Yeah.  Than walking.  Yeah.  Much safer. 
[03:12:30]  That's a statistic.  Than walking.  Yep.  Jimmy's leaving us to go to Virginia Beach.  Tickets available?  Yeah.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday?  Yep.  And you can get my special on jimnorton.com if you want to.  Yeah.  But if you don't...  Don't start to catch up to me alone.  What happened, Jimmy?  Huh?  What happened?  No, I'm all right.  Nothing.  I'm just enjoying languishing.  No, I'm fine.  I'm fine. 
[03:13:00]  I'm all right.  You know, okay.  You all right?  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Just rambles on and on.  What happened?  My favorite guest?  Colin Quinn.  Oh, I forgot Colin was here.  Man, she was all over Colin.  He escaped hours ago.  All over Colin.  Right.  Of course.  You were really a little slutty.  It was kind of hard to watch.  Yeah.  He's beautiful, though.  He's a really nice guy.  Oh, thank you.  And were you trying to lip kiss him?  What?  He was trying to get some tongue. 
[03:13:30]  You were trying to get some mouth.  On the lips?  Yeah.  He was a ciggy breath.  Yeah, why not?  Because you were kissing him on the cheek, and then he kept going over, closer, closer to  his mouth, closer to his...  Yeah.  You don't do that.  If the guy wants to kiss you on the mouth, he'll turn his head.  Would you have tongue kissed him?  Yeah.  How about if you wanted to press his crotch on yours?  Um, I don't know if I'd go that far.  So you should feel your liver moisture.  Yes.  A little of that liver weeping.  Yeah.  Maybe you want to hear the crinkle of your diapers.  I'll tell you right now.  Tell who, kid?  We got the latest thing.  Liver moisture.  Liver moisture. 
[03:14:00]  Liver moisture.  Niggas get that?  This is fat.  That's all it is.  I think anyway.  That's a mirror.  No, I'm serious.  Really.  No, you got to stop drinking.  Yeah.  Okay.  Please.  I'll do the best I can.  No.  That's not...  What do you think?  We were born yesterday?  It's not the best.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best...  No?  I'm listening.  Now go away.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's right.  You picked the perfect song.  Go away!  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:14:30]  Look.  It's been a lovely day.  Lovely four days.  This was great.  We'll see you, you know, down the road someday.  All right.  Oh, man.  How was that, lady?  What do you think of the show today?  All right.  Hey, don't have any nightmares tonight, guys, about this, uh, the makeup thing.  What do you think of the show today?  It was all right, except for the makeup.  Now, I have to go wash this all off.  I can't walk around like this.  Just hang out.  Just hang out.  Huh?  No, no.  You don't wash her. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  You should hang out.  What?  You're getting a lot of good looks from the people around here because of the makeup.  Yeah, a lot of good looks.  Like, ha-ha, you know.  You thought you would get more for that t-shirt?  No.  You don't think so?  No, I don't think so.  Not at all.  I just wanted to show it to everybody, really.  I knew I wasn't going to get anything for it.  You sure?  A dollar?  That's nothing.  Come on.  Well, he was joking.  I'm sure he would have, if he stayed longer, he would have paid you a couple hundred at least.  Marion was being a little annoying today, wasn't she?  She's going to call me later on. 
[03:15:30]  She's, uh...  Kind of obnoxious, right?  No, no, no.  What does she do when she calls you later?  You know, I don't have to.  I just...  Sometimes I just put it on an answering machine or whatever.  Or I don't pick it up.  I don't pick it up.  You don't want to deal with her.  I don't pick it up until I'm ready.  Because you don't want to deal with her.  She gives you the business every day?  Hmm.  Not every day.  No.  I can't say that.  A lot of days.  Let me tell you something.  This was, uh...  How long ago now?  Around two months ago.  Right. 
[03:16:00]  Okay, I went to the doctor.  I went to the clinic.  I got a few blood tests and everything.  And I don't know.  So far, it's okay, you know.  But the doctor said I ought to quit drinking.  You know, the doctor even said that.  Right.  But my blood pressure is okay.  And what else?  So he says you've got to stop drinking and you're still drinking.  Yeah, he's a doctor.  Right?  He's a doctor.  So you listen to a doctor that actually saw you and put you through some tests?  He put me through tests. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  And what's this?  Knock on wood.  Everything came out.  But he said you've got to stop drinking.  So he probably sees some signs of things that are going wrong with you because of the drinking.  Right.  You know?  What type of things do you think are going wrong because of the drinking?  Die?  All right.  Well, first of all, I'm getting heavy.  I noticed.  And second of all, second of all, I went through a whole lot of money.  And by the way, it was not $60,000.  I calculated it. 
[03:17:00]  It was around $30,000.  Really?  Hmm.  But that's still a lot of money.  So.  And I don't, I'm not going to do that ever.  Your vagina doesn't look too bad in those pants.  Huh?  The vagina doesn't look too bad in those pants.  You can't see her.  Yeah, look.  You got a little camel toe happening.  Nice.  Oh, really?  I do?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oafster's on the, you know, die.  The Oafster used to put up some numbers.  Okay.  What?  He's looking at your vagina.  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  What?  I can't, I can't compliment her on her vagina. 
[03:17:30]  Were you just being chivalrous?  No, just spread your legs.  Look.  See?  Nice.  Oh, okay.  I see you.  One thing, Opie.  What?  Button up your, uh...  My pants?  Yeah, I don't know.  Are they buttons?  Yeah, but see what happened was, because I was looking at your vagina, it popped a button.  Oh, wow.  Oh, okay.  It's starting to, it's starting to, you know...  Okay.  There's something happening down there.  Right, right, right.  Quick rush of blood.  That's why I'm going to leave now.  All right.  It's a little too crazy.  Okay.  So, uh...  Talk to you tomorrow.  Nice vagina, though.  I guess I get paid tomorrow, right? 
[03:18:00]  Tomorrow's payday.  What?  What happened?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, I'm getting paid tomorrow.  Okay.  All right, so I guess everybody should just stay tuned.  The after show is next.  Okay.  Very good.  The Opie and Anthony show has drawn to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments  of today's show.  Sam Roberts, Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments. </pre>
