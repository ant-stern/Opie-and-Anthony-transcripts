<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  The pre-show heavily featured a discussion about the US victory in the World Cup against Ghana, debating the extent of World Cup fever in America and contrasting it with the Super Bowl's hype.  Sports documentary maker Pete Radovich called in to offer his perspective.  A significant portion was dedicated to an investigation into E-Rock's purported Florida vacation (suspected to actually be in Italy), using clues from his out-of-office email, conversations with colleagues, and his computer browsing history. New intern Carrie Ann contributed to this humorous investigation.  Other pre-show topics included a lisping inventor's awkward wood-powered car demonstration; Anthony's aggressive stance on US foreign policy and the Iraq War; the hosts' reaction to a graphic ISIS execution photo in the New York Daily News; the inconvenience of presidential visits; a coincidental parallel with Howard Stern's show regarding a Billy Squire video; and a conversation with upcoming main show guest Pat Monahan of Train about the challenges of watching TV with young children.  Dan Soder was also announced as a later guest.

The main show opened with Pat Monahan of Train.  Their conversation began with a discussion about a viral shark video's authenticity (deemed fake).  They then transitioned to the music industry, Monahan's experiences with 360 deals and streaming services like Spotify, and the challenges of the digital music landscape.  Monahan recounted past jobs (sheet metal work, house painting, caddying), sharing anecdotes about his encounters with mafia figures and celebrities while caddying. He discussed the emotional toll of performing and promoting music, and the unpredictable nature of stand-up comedy, mentioning the "Walking Game." Monahan played a new single, "Angel in Blue Jeans." The segment concluded with a humorous listener-submitted anecdote about a supposed encounter with Barry Manilow.  Jimmy Norton's absence (filming for Vice) was mentioned.

A subsequent segment returned to the World Cup, with the hosts and callers expressing confusion and using offensive language to describe their perceptions of soccer and its fans. They compared the game unfavorably to hockey and American football. Callers attempted to explain the sport's appeal but were largely unsuccessful.  Other topics included aggressive driving and Amber/Silver Alerts; criticism of Bill O'Reilly and Fox News (including Bill Devane's silver investment commercials); a caller mentioning a documentary about racism in European soccer; a caller recounting a chance encounter with Michael Shannon; the planned reopening of Action Park; and Delta Airlines' apology for a controversial World Cup-themed tweet featuring a giraffe.

A segment focused on several companies issuing apologies: Delta Airlines' giraffe tweet, JetBlue's apology to a mother whose toddler urinated on the plane, and KFC's apology for a Mississippi restaurant's treatment of a child with facial injuries.  The hosts expressed outrage and used vulgar language, focusing extensively on pit bulls and sharing related anecdotes. A caller recounted a story of a police officer shooting a pit bull.  Further apologies discussed included ESPN's apology for the L.A. mayor's profanity and TLC's apology for a UK airing of a profane Honey Boo Boo episode.

A segment heavily featured a discussion about Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino's upcoming reality show, with guest comedian Dan Soder.  The hosts and Soder used homophobic slurs, misogynistic remarks, and racial stereotypes while dissecting the show's trailer and commenting on the family's dynamic.  They also briefly discussed siblings of celebrities and made crude jokes about Jenny Hutt. A brief interaction with someone claiming to be Jenny Hutt's cousin occurred.  Rory McIlroy's lost luggage with United Airlines was briefly mentioned.

Numerous advertisements aired throughout the broadcast, including for LLC incorporation, adult products, tanker driver jobs, SiriusXM, brain training games, dry cleaning franchises, joint supplements, language learning software, vehicles, and various other franchise opportunities.

The post-show segment featured Opie, Anthony, Dan Soder, and Nicole Ryan.  The conversation began with a birthday cake and quickly shifted to a lengthy, vulgar discussion about pit bulls, their aggression, and comparing them to human criminals.  The hosts and guests discussed the intelligence of dogs and cats, and a fictional survival scenario involving fighting off animals.  The segment concluded with thank-yous to guests and promotion of the post-show podcast, followed by more advertisements.

[00:01:30]  We're in here preparing for another big Opie and Anthony show.  Big guests on today's show.  I'll get into that in a little bit.  But, a rare first segment guest on today's Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  We're starting with a bang.  Right at 630.  And I'll tell you who that is in just a little bit.  But, as we do every morning,  we're going to figure out what Opie and Anthony may be talking about on today's show. 
[00:02:00]  As well as learning from the history of yesterday's show.  And we'll start with Lou in Jersey.  Lou, welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  Thank you, Sammy.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I was wondering if Roland's got his U.S. soccer jersey on today for some high fives.  I haven't noticed yet.  I would assume that he's got one ordered if he doesn't have it already.  Of course, I'm sure that Roland does not have a U.S. soccer jersey, but he will.  By the time it arrives, they'll be back to losing soccer games.  But today would be the day to get high fives. 
[00:02:30]  We were talking on the show yesterday about nobody on the Opie and Anthony show having World Cup fever.  That it just hasn't really hit Opie, Anthony, or Jim yet.  I mean, yesterday was a big deal.  You know, the guys were saying that in America, the World Cup hasn't really caught on.  And I don't know, it was a pretty big deal when America won that game yesterday.  Anyway, Pete Radovich, is that his name? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, Pete Radovich called in an old friend of the guys who's done a bunch of sports documentaries, won a whole bunch of Emmys.  He called in.  Well, he didn't actually call in.  Opie Cole called him.  It was another classic Opie Cole call where he just puts the speakerphone up to the mic.  But Opie called him because he was texting in going, you guys are killing me with this World Cup talk.  And Opie, he made an attempt to change the minds of Opie, Anthony, and Jim. 
[00:03:30]  No one's invited me to a soccer party yet.  Like the Super Bowl or the World Series or anything like that.  I have not been invited to one soccer party.  But why is it in our circles, we're not talking about soccer.  So it has to be the younger people.  Younger and definitely there's an element of, you know, of foreigners that are a little bit more into it.  But I think Americans are more and more into it.  Listen, the ratings are off the charts, relatively speaking. 
[00:04:00]  And it's a big deal because it's every four years.  The World Series, the Super Bowl, all that stuff is every year.  I get that it's big and it is important, but when it's every four years, it just adds a lot more weight.  No, I understand how important the World Cup is, but I've yet to see one car driving down the expressway with an American flag tied to its hood. 
[00:04:30]  A lot of Brazilians.  You've got to go to Portland, you've got to go to St. Louis.  There are some cities out there that are hardcore U.S. soccer.  And by the way, they are pretty good, but they're in the worst group.  They've got the absolute, they've got the group of death.  They've got the toughest group, so they have the heart.  And basically, just FYI, I'll give you 10 seconds on the cup.  It's 32 teams, eight groups of four.  So there's eight groups.  Each group has 14.  Within each group, everyone plays each other one time. 
[00:05:00]  And then after that's done, two teams from each group advance to basically a sweet 16 single elimination.  So U.S. plays Ghana, Portugal, Germany.  Of those four teams, two will advance to the sweet 16.  U.S. has a really tough chance because they're in a really tough group.  Thus then, no one cares about soccer.  Look, it's a solid argument.  There's no denying that.  There's a large portion of the population that could give a fuck less about soccer. 
[00:05:30]  And especially, if you did this survey when World Cup was not happening, if you waited six months and did a survey, how much of a fuck do you give about soccer?  The scores would be so much lower.  But World Cup is going on, and especially right now, it's a tough argument to make.  Only because everybody was talking about America winning this game yesterday.  And it was, I mean, it was exciting to see a goal scored within the first 30 seconds and then a goal scored within the last 90 seconds. 
[00:06:00]  And that's how America wins, especially after that German coach we have was just shit-talking America up and down.  I don't know.  Obviously, I've been infected with World Cup fever.  And by that, I mean I read on Twitter when the game's over and then go to Deadspin and see the highlights.  But I think other people have it too.  It was another obsession, though, that was taking over the Opie and Anthony show yesterday.  There was no time for anybody to think about football, as I call it, as somebody with World Cup fever. 
[00:06:30]  There was no time for anybody to think about any games, really, because the Opie and Anthony show became the number one show for detective work anywhere in the country.  That was because we realized early in the show, Opie realized that E-Rock was on vacation.  And E-Rock tried to be very sneaky about his vacation this time.  He told us behind the scenes that he was not going to be here, but he never told Opie, Anthony, or Jim that he was going on vacation. 
[00:07:00]  Then we start putting clues together, and we realize that E-Rock may have been lying about his vacation to the entire staff of the show, which is a very strange thing to do.  When you work in close quarters, there's a small group of us who work on the show.  We all work together.  We work in a creative way.  So you think that there's some, I mean, you know, as much as we fuck with each other, there's some level of when you tell me something, I know you're not lying to me. 
[00:07:30]  I'm not going to say a level of trust, but at least, like, if you look at me in the face and say, this is what's happening, I go, okay, I know that this is what's happening.  Not the case with E-Rock.  As it turns out, he may have been lying, and clues started to come in.  And he told all of us, behind the scenes, that he was taking a week off to go to Florida.  Come to find out, he may have been in Italy. 
[00:08:00]  Listen to how these clues start piling in on yesterday's show.  It didn't strike me until we started talking about all this international stuff.  Is that on his out-of-office reply for the email, it says,  I will have limited access to phone slash email.  That could be to throw us off the trail, though.  He never writes that he will have limited phone.  Exactly, but maybe his wife finally said, hey, stupid, why don't you write, we'll have limited access.  And he went, okay. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  He's called access A-X-E-S.  He's probably right under our noses.  Limited access.  He's probably vacationing in Times Square, figure that's the safest place.  Yeah, he's eating at Delphi's skills every night.  Right under our noses.  All right, so we got that as a clue.  All right.  That information, coupled with the information that Sal obtained.  Sal, the information that I'm referring to is about movies and a tablet.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  So the other day, Roland was kind enough to give Iraq a chance to get a major discount on a tablet.  And he's been going on and on about this fucking tablet for months now.  What was the tablet?  I don't even...  Because Iraq can't vomit, it would help his stomach?  I don't even know what it is, but like he was going on like, yeah, I'm going traveling for a bit.  I want to make sure, you know, I have this, like if it's really fucking official business or something like that.  He just wants to watch movies.  And so Roland's like, oh, here's a time and place you can go. 
[00:09:30]  I think this was approximately Tuesday or Wednesday of last week.  And Iraq was like, no, can't go.  Roland's like, I got you the hookup.  Just go there.  They'll take care of you.  Blah, blah, blah, whatever.  Iraq's like, no, I'm too busy packing, blah, blah, blah, all this sort of shit.  But whatever.  Iraq comes in on Wednesday.  He has his laptop with him.  It's like his personal laptop.  And he keeps on asking me, like, what are some good movies to watch?  And I'm like, you know, I'm giving him a couple here and there.  And he explicitly said he had an exuberant amount of time on the flight to watch multiple movies. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  And that's not a flight to Florida.  All right.  Florida could squeeze in one, one and a half movies.  And he was also thinking about, like, a new series he could star and stuff like that.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I think.  That's a longer flight than Florida.  Right.  Now, those two pieces of information.  Yes.  Joined by the smoking gun, I feel like.  Oh, what is this?  Our new intern, Carrie Ann, brought this to my attention.  Uh-huh.  Which one is she?  Uh, is she? 
[00:10:30]  Should we have her tell us?  We should hear it from the, uh.  Which one is she?  The one that comes in here more than the other one?  She's the one who's about to come in.  With the glasses or no?  Yeah, she has glasses.  Oh, okay.  She remembered a piece of information.  Oh, office girl.  Yes.  Yeah, she looks like a girl from the office.  Yes.  Hello.  Oh, this is high.  What did you, what did you find out?  So, on Wednesday, after the show, we were sitting in the office, and Don got us pizza. 
[00:11:00]  And we were sitting there, and as Eric was leaving, he said, chow.  Oh!  I'm a good listener.  Oh, no, he probably meant what he was going to get.  All right.  And, after all that on yesterday's show, that wasn't the most important piece of our  new intern Carrie Ann's investigation.  Listen to this next clip, track eight.  You're sweating today?  Yeah, a little.  Why? 
[00:11:30]  I'm nervous.  Why are you nervous?  Why are you nervous?  Nervous.  What?  You know.  You shouldn't point that out to people as soon as they walk in.  Yeah.  It's rude.  How could you tell she was sweating?  Her left arm.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Oh, no.  No, I don't want to show it now.  She's pitting out a little bit.  It's all right.  But she's got a very light, summery shirt on.  Yeah.  But, no, it's kind of thick, actually.  Not a hint of a sleeve when you're sweating profusely.  Yeah, it's air-conditioned in here.  Oh, man.  It's not that bad.  It's just because it's a green shirt. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, that's fine.  Nothing wrong with that at all.  It's cool.  Jeez.  Sophie, you bring it up.  Yeah.  It's okay.  It's noticeable.  Exactly.  I've noticed.  I've seen plenty of people coming off heroin.  It happens.  Yeah, it's nice and cool in here.  What's going on with you?  Delightful temperature.  Right.  You should run around like a maniac.  Are we allowed to say you're cute?  I don't know if we're allowed to do that these days.  We used to be able to say shit.  Yeah.  We're very cute.  Thanks.  Because I don't want people to think you're some slob that's just sweating in front of 
[00:12:30]  us.  Yeah.  No.  No, we're just talking about him.  The fact is that you're cute and sweating makes it kind of funnier, I think.  Okay, in hindsight, maybe it wasn't so necessary to the investigation to replay that clip,  but I thought it was important to paint the picture.  Snowy in Michigan.  Samuel.  What's up, buddy?  I'll have to call you guys all out on something.  Now, you made a comment yesterday.  Why wouldn't you just say to us, I'm going to Italy, don't call me, and you wouldn't 
[00:13:00]  bother him.  Now, he was on his honeymoon, which I would think you would think means bother me while  I'm on my honeymoon, yet you guys called him and made weird noises.  That did happen.  However.  The idea, though, that's maybe why he's not being totally honest with us.  Don't say totally honest.  He's lying.  He's lying.  And here's the difference.  That when you lie about something, and this is something that happens to Iraq every single  time.  He thinks he's slick. 
[00:13:30]  Everybody figures out that he's lying because he's not slick.  And then everybody's way more interested than they would have been.  And if he had just told the truth, odds are we wouldn't have even thought about the fact  that he was in Italy.  And even if we had, all he has to do is turn his phone off instead of us going through this  whole thing and figuring out his hotels and doing everything.  Didn't he try that before and you guys just got, like, started calling the hotel and everything  else when, I mean, is that the whole thing with the, uh, the, the Fatlantis incident? 
[00:14:00]  I mean, you guys were calling him on the hotel phone, weren't you?  Right, but what I'm saying is, the, the odds of that happening do not go down if he lies  about it.  They go up because it makes it more interesting because he thinks he's being slick.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I understand.  I mean, you guys are calling him out and I understand that.  Right.  Yeah, he's such a lesson, but not like saying, please don't call me.  Well, that's not really going to work.  Neither is it.  With not, it will work better than this. 
[00:14:30]  Thank you.  Better.  Okay.  All right, buddy.  Todd in Pittsburgh.  Hey, Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  Uh, this is a deep-seated sexual thrill that E-Rock gets.  Mm-hmm.  The humiliation of getting caught.  He just...  The videos of the guy jacking off so the maid catches him.  Right.  Like, it's like, like, like when you jerk off, like he's jerking off in a hotel room with  the door at your...  Yeah.  Like, uh-oh, you got me.  Right.  Like, like, E-Rock just finds his way into dunder-headed schemes. 
[00:15:00]  And then just because he likes the idea of being, hey, how'd you guys catch me?  Oh, no, not again.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, and then he gets to get upset and he uses it for jerk-off fodder.  Maybe you're right, Todd.  I think I am.  Well, uh, you too, buddy.  We went a little further into the, uh, E-Rock investigation.  This was no cold case.  We kept this hot and warm the whole time.  And, uh, and, uh, well, we closed the case. 
[00:15:30]  We, we kept investigating the clues.  Um, and somebody on the phone suggested that we look at E-Rock's web history here in the  studio.  Now, in order for this to work, it would mean that E-Rock was planning his vacation while  he was supposed to be running the board on the show.  Uh, so we weren't sure, but, uh, as it turned out, it was enough to indeed close the case.  Oh, we might have something?  Yeah, case closed.  Oh!  Um, what do you mean case closed? 
[00:16:00]  Case closed.  So the E-Rock mystery might be done because we decided to...  It's not might be.  Oh, wow.  That's solved.  So Travis is sitting in a seat that E-Rock also sits in.  Yes, which is one happier seat today.  And, uh, and there's a computer there, and, you know...  Going through the browsing history.  Okay.  Browsing history of E-Rock's computer.  And now, I know what I search for.  Uh-huh.  I certainly...  Gay porn.  Yes, exactly.  And stars, of course.  And I certainly did not search, uh, for... 
[00:16:30]  Italian bikini pics?  A hotel in Rome.  Oh!  And a hotel in Florence.  Oh!  Case closed.  Case closed.  Duh.  What time is it in Italy right now?  Three o'clock.  In the afternoon, huh?  Yes.  Well, I would say that, uh, those phone numbers could probably be gotten from the website.  Oh, boy.  Oh, oh.  You know what, Jim?  You're probably right.  Oh.  And I think a well-wish a vacation. 
[00:17:00]  I think we should call and wish them well.  I think that's 100% accurate.  You think that's a good idea?  I think it's a terrific idea.  Just to let him know his friends are thinking about him?  Yeah.  A bonjourno.  A bonjourno.  Hey, Rocco.  What day is he going to be there?  Oh, Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I hope Michael Leone's fucking wife is giving him a ride.  Now, how does the staff feel about him just blatantly lying to you guys who have never 
[00:17:30]  really done him, well, you haven't done him as much harm as us?  Italy.  We weren't told he was going on vacation.  You guys were told Florida.  That's got to hurt a little more.  Yeah.  Of course, because it's a blatant lie.  It's not like he just didn't say it.  He lied to everybody's face.  Right.  And even if he said, well, I did go to Florida, but then I went to Italy from Florida, that's  not the same thing.  No, no, no.  He lied to everybody.  Wow.  He did.  So he's going to be in Rome and Florence.  It's just bad for team.  You know what I mean?  For team spirit.  I think so. 
[00:18:00]  Maybe it's also bad for team spirit to call somebody and make whale noises in the phone.  I don't know everything about team spirit.  I just know lying is bad.  My mom told me.  Psycho Bob in Baltimore.  Morning, Sam.  Morning, buddy.  Hey, this is a brilliant new move on E-Rock's part.  He's on vacation and yet he's still the focus of the show.  I think it's absolutely brilliant and well thought out.  Yeah, I mean, look, either he is such an attention whore that he's using house of cards 
[00:18:30]  like schemes to make sure that everybody is paying attention to him.  Or he's a dunderhead.  I can't tell.  I can't tell anymore.  Maybe he's a genius.  You know, he could very well be smarter than all of us.  Todd in Jersey.  Hey, Sam.  So I'm coming to E-Rock's defense here.  I did some Google research yesterday and found that there is a Hotel Florida in Sorrento, Italy.  Maybe it's all just a misunderstanding.  Maybe he was in Hotel Florida and you just didn't hear him say hotel. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  I think that's the most likely scenario.  Thank you, Todd.  But, you know, if he had just said, I'm going to Italy, then you wouldn't have people like Todd in Jersey  Googling hotels in Italy like it's a manhunt for E-Rock.  Wow.  It was amazing.  Well, today on the show, I don't know if we'll have time for any investigations because it's going to be a very big show.  We start out the show very rare first segment guest is scheduled. 
[00:19:30]  Pat Monahan from Train, the lead singer of Train, popping by.  He's coming right from the airport to hang out with Opie and Anthony to start the show.  Very exciting.  Last time he was in, he performed.  I don't think he has the band with him this time.  Plus, he just got off an airplane.  But, nevertheless, he will be here.  And later in the show, Dan Soder.  Always hilarious.  Dan Soder will be on the Opie and Anthony show.  And a lot to get to as far as clips go. 
[00:20:00]  Of course, the World Cup game with the U.S. winning.  Of course, de Blasio going on Jimmy Kimmel and singing I Love L.A.  But it was such a cop-out because he barely even sang.  He had a whole bunch of kids backing him up.  And then, oh, let the kids sing.  It's a cop-out.  But, before we move on completely from yesterday's show,  we watched a clip that we found online of a guy who invented a way to fuel a car with wood. 
[00:20:30]  Now, initially, we all said there's no way this guy survives  because this fueling a car with wood is going to put the oil industries out of business.  The oil industries are going to get him.  We were trying to figure out how you fuel a car with wood.  How did he figure out how to make this thing?  It wasn't until the clip started that we were all distracted by something  that has nothing to do with fuel or wood that this really took effect. 
[00:21:00]  How does this work?  Because there's a couple of ways you could use wood for fuel.  Herb Hartman heads to the chopping block.  We call it a gasifier because it changes solid mass.  No.  Oh, no.  Solid mass.  The adult list.  He's got to fix it.  That's called the gasifier.  Steam.  Runs on steam.  Your butt's a gasifier. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  A gasifier.  Steam.  Or something.  Fucking grow up and say your ass is right like a big boy.  Oh, my goodness.  Push the fucking tongue out, right?  Oh, my.  Isn't that what you do?  No, you push it behind your teeth.  Yes.  Oh.  Yeah, close your teeth.  Close your teeth, right.  Keep it in your yap.  Sis.  Here's how you handle it.  Every time he goes right across the face with a spatula, a nice warm spatula.  A nice uppercut to remind him to keep those teeth together. 
[00:22:00]  Talk like a big boy.  You know what the lesson to be learned from that is?  Anyone, young people, young people, if you're out there listening, if it's before your school day  and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony pre-show, what you need to do is make sure  you go to speech class because that right there proves this is a guy who invented a way  to fuel automobiles with wood instead of gasoline and that is not strong enough to take attention 
[00:22:30]  away from the fact that you're an adult who lisps.  Anybody out there who's young and has a lisp, take care of that shit now because there are  no life accomplishments, the Opie and Anthony show, what you just heard there is the same  thing that happens in everybody's head when a person with a lisp talks.  You laugh in your head, you start, but you can't say anything.  But that's what goes on.  That's the subconscious of every person.  Not the subconscious.  That's just the consciousness of everybody who hears a person with a lisp. 
[00:23:00]  Anybody out there who was born with some kind of speech impediment, please try to get  that taken care of early because there are no accomplishments that are going to make  it okay.  Speaking of making it okay, this whole Iraq situation is a little crazy right now.  The story this morning is that Obama is saying, yeah, I'm not going to send any troops over  to Iraq to fight, but that's not to say I won't send some people over there to help. 
[00:23:30]  Like the first speech is, no, we're not sending any combat troops over there.  And then the next thing is, ah, ah, ah, I said, combat troops, we may still send some  people over there to train people.  And it's like, look, we've been over there for years training soldiers and they're just  running away.  It's, it's, it's, it's insanity.  Ant broke down what was going on in Iraq a little bit yesterday.  I'm anxious to hear what he has to say today, given the new developments.  But let's, let's hear what Ant said yesterday. 
[00:24:00]  You know, we should fucking do what other nations have done over the years.  You, you, you conquer a country and then it's yours.  You take the resources, you put your own fucking people in there and you keep it.  Occupied Iraq.  We should have fucking just kept it as our own.  Start pumping oil, shipping it back here and fuck, ah, fuck them.  But no, we're going to make a democracy and give the people freedom.  They don't want it.  They love being little babies with daddy Saddam smacking them in the face whenever they fucked 
[00:24:30]  up.  They ran away quickly, huh?  They could not throw their weapons down and their uniforms off and run away quick enough.  And, uh, they still got caught.  Some of them, I've seen a lot of these, uh, militants with, um, American weapons, right?  Not as many, they all used to just have AK-47s and now they like got fucking M-16s, M-4s.  Right.  Yeah.  Once again, we stick our dick where it doesn't belong and we fucking lose. 
[00:25:00]  Every time we do this since fucking Vietnam, stop it.  Mind your fucking business.  Well, unfortunately we can't because now the oil prices have gone up.  The stock market gets are all skittish and scared now.  But gas didn't go down at all though.  In all these years did gas really drop?  No, of course not.  We didn't see one more for oil.  Why?  Yeah.  Help me out here.  You would think we would have got some nice cheap gas out of it.  Nothing.  Plus all these fucking hybrid cars now.  The oil is not the issue anymore.  It's, uh, it's, it's a bad situation though because now, you know, you've got these Al-Qaeda 
[00:25:30]  guys and they are ravaging the banks in Iraq now.  Just, just, now they're well financed, well armed, and, uh, now they have a whole country  to fucking frolic in and train in.  We'll see what, uh, see what they come up with next.  As far as what they have in store for, uh, the United States.  And, uh, you know, there's really nothing you can do.  What are you gonna do?  Get a drone up there and drop a few bombs? 
[00:26:00]  Eh, it's not gonna do anything.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if I go as far as to say colonize Iraq the way, uh, the way  Ant does.  I mean, I'm not saying we wouldn't benefit from it, but there's no doubt about it that  we gotta leave that place alone.  Just hands off.  Okay, admit it.  We went in a little too far.  We made a mistake.  You guys are on your own now.  And that's it.  And that's it.  And just let, let nature take its course.  I think.  But, I'm an idiot.  Nick in Niagara Falls.  Welcome to the pre-show. 
[00:26:30]  Hi, Sam.  Uh, there were a lot of revelations about Iraq yesterday.  One of the, uh, ones I found most interesting was, uh, the fact that he spent $600 a night  on hotel rooms.  Um, just wondering if, if you ever spend that much money on a hotel room.  No, I can, uh, I am, I'm a man of the people, Nick.  I can honestly say I have never spent $600 on a hotel room or even close to that.  I didn't know there were hotel rooms that cost $600.  Preposterous.  Yeah.  I spent $60 on a hotel room once. 
[00:27:00]  Never $600.  Attaboy.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  Um, the other thing that I wanted to get to before we move on to today's Opie and Anthony  Show, which, as I said, features a rare live-in-studio first-segment guest, Pat Monaghan, the lead singer  of Train, will be stopping by.  He hasn't been by in a while.  And a little while after that, later this morning, Dan Soder in studio on the Opie and  Anthony Show.  Uh, and I'm sure he's going to kill again, as he always does.  Uh, but yesterday we were talking, uh, about internet porn and how back in the day, in 
[00:27:30]  the Dizze, as some people would say, uh, there was one communal computer and nobody really  knew the technology of where downloads were stored and everything.  Jim was talking about his parents finding his porn on his computer.  Uh, Sal, let's go to Trek 1.  I think one time I downloaded a golden shower video and I didn't know where, like, downloads  went on the computer.  Oh, no!  So I think, I think mother may have stumbled onto it by accident. 
[00:28:00]  You would download some of that stuff on your parents' computer?  On my parents' gateway.  I didn't know any better back then.  Meaning, I didn't know how to do it.  I don't remember where I got it from.  Oh, my God.  Back then, you couldn't hide anything either.  No, because I didn't know where it went.  I didn't know how to search for stuff.  So I just downloaded it.  I'm like, where'd that piss video go?  Where'd it go?  Well, I guess it must have just disappeared.  I didn't know that when you downloaded something, it just went somewhere.  Oh, no.  Oh, your poor mom.  It took, like, 20 minutes to download, like, literally a 30-second clip of someone tinkling. 
[00:28:30]  It was so crazy.  Did she ever call you out on it?  No, she did not.  Yeah, it was down.  I think, yeah, it was, you only had one family computer.  It was downstairs in the big Gateway computer.  The big Gateway.  That was the big deal back then was Gateway.  Yeah, right.  They were the shit.  The box that had, like, cow spots on it.  Cow spots, yeah.  Are they still a computer company?  No way.  Oh, God.  Gateway's got to be gone, right?  I think they're game.  That's funny, though.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  It is true, though.  Sometimes you download.  When you first got into computers, because all you wanted to do was look at porn.  Right.  So you download it, and then it's like, well, where'd it go?  How do I change the path?  There's a real concept of computers, so you didn't know to look in other folders, and...  And everyone had family computers at first.  Yes.  You didn't have your own computer, and you would just go, ah, I guess it's gone.  You would just, ah, whatevs.  Ah, it's gone, I guess.  If I can't find it, no one else will be able to anyway.  Right.  I would love to talk to Jim Norton's parents about those last few years he lived at home. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, they must have been living in a world of denial.  For their golden shower videos on the family computer, prostitutes being brought back to  the house at night.  Like, what a horror.  What a horror show.  Well, speaking of horror shows, it's about time for the Opie and Anthony show to begin.  Big, big show today.  The mayor of Los Angeles is deciding to curse at press conferences because his hockey team 
[00:30:00]  won, and because his hockey team won, Mayor de Blasio is singing poorly on Jimmy Kimmel.  We'll get to both those clips today, plus Dan Soder stops by in a little while later this  morning, and we start the show with Pat Monahan from the band.  The Opie and Anthony show starts right now. 
[00:30:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[00:31:00]  We'll be right back.  Thank you. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Get the show on the road.  Good morning, everybody. 
[00:36:00]  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you, everybody.  Hey, God damn it.  Hi, peeps.  Hi, peeps.  I'm going to be a verdict.  I'm going to be a verdict.  Words hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're on the page of the page of the page of the page of the page of the paper today.  The New York Daily News. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, they just got stills of the executions going on in Iraq.  It's nice.  Nice.  I mean, this picture, it just happened.  I mean, the guy's blood is all over the ground as he's leaning forward on his knees with one  of these animals behind him.  The old execution style.  Of course.  And I was thinking about this picture and I was telling Anthony, words hurt, but I guess  this is okay for us to see.  That's fine.  But if there was a, let's say, a word written on the front of that paper that was derogatory 
[00:37:00]  towards somebody maybe sexually or race-wise or anything.  We're not even.  Not even.  Not even, right.  You know, just maybe a headline, Ghana looked retarded in their game against the U.S.  You would see them apologizing if anyone was offended by the word.  Of course.  Yet, there is a murder right there on the cover and nothing.  That's just news.  This is brutal.  It is pretty.  This is way worse than discussing words. 
[00:37:30]  That's nightmare-inducing, especially if you're just a child and that's laying around  the house.  There's more of a chance of a kid seeing that laying on the kitchen table in the morning  morning than some TV show that they wouldn't want to watch or a radio show that you know  they're not listening to.  Right.  Yet, that's fine.  That's why we're just insane.  It's hypocritical.  We're just absolutely insane because this picture is brutal.  That's a good one.  But I'm sure we'll have a whole bunch of apologies for silly shit today. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  Shouldn't they apologize for having this picture on the front page of the paper?  Sorry, we put this on the front page of a paper that's probably laying around your  house so your kid can see it and go, ah!  Monsters!  Monsters!  Monsters!  Right.  I learned my whole job is to keep my son's eyes all lit up.  Just lit up and shiny and nice and innocent.  Yes.  Look at our eyes.  They're dull.  They have faded a bit. 
[00:38:30]  But a child's eyes, they are bright and lit up and full of wonder.  Sparkling.  Hope and wonder and curiosity.  And I figured out as a dad, as a parent, your whole job is to try to keep those light,  the light in his eyes nice and bright as long as you can.  It's like a game in this world.  It seems impossible.  One day he's going to come out of his room and you're going to see the brightness in his  eyes are just a little duller.  He'll say, what happened, son?  Ah! 
[00:39:00]  Right.  And then he'll relay some story about how something happened that he didn't know happened  in life.  Exactly.  How he got shit on somehow by somebody.  It takes a little bit.  Just a little bit.  A sparkle away.  I mean, they'll still be sparkling.  Oh, sure.  But you fast forward a couple decades and man, you don't even know what color my eyes are  anymore.  It's just black eyes, lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  So with that said, this is so much more horrific to a child than if a child heard the word 
[00:39:30]  faggot or retard or the dreaded N word that I'm too scared to say at times.  And all the other ones that come with that.  Tranny.  Oh boy.  What are some of the other words that will get you in trouble?  Cripple.  Cripple.  Cripple.  Um.  Um.  Stupid.  Midget.  Midget.  Uh.  I don't know.  Imbecile.  You know all the words. 
[00:40:00]  But it's just amazing to me.  We know this is going on in Iraq, but really on the front fucking page.  The front fucking page.  ISIS is over there.  ISIS.  Look out for ISIS.  I don't know.  That's a fucking wacky situation.  ISIS.  But they came up with kind of a cool name.  You know what?  That's a good name.  Everyone remembers it.  It's not like Al Qaeda.  No one even knew how to spell Al Qaeda or say it.  ISIS.  Al Qaeda.  Remember?  Al Qaeda.  Al Qaeda.  Al Qaeda.  Al Qaeda.  ISIS is easy. 
[00:40:30]  Sounds like an arch villain.  It's pretty badass.  ISIS.  Yeah.  What the hell are we going to do?  Cranking their way across Iraq.  We're in a tough situation.  Well.  Thank God.  Because it's.  Who do you got?  The Sunnis.  The Sunnis.  And who are the other guys?  And the.  Who are those?  The Turk guys.  Right?  Or the.  I don't know.  So if we go and help, that means we're taking the side of.  Which one?  The Sunnis?  The Sunnis?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  The Kurds. 
[00:41:00]  What about the Kurds?  Are the Kurds involved?  Where do the Kurds fit in?  Let's see.  The Kurds.  Sunnis.  There's no borders.  They just have these places that they sit and.  It's horrible.  I don't know.  Jihad.  Jihadists.  I think.  Oh.  Shiites.  Kurds.  Shiites are in there.  I believe.  Sunnis.  Sunnis.  No one really knows.  I went to a Sunni.  Here.  You had to go to Sunni.  Uh.  Geneseo.  Sunni Geneseo.  I'm a Sunni I guess. 
[00:41:30]  What's the difference?  Hey I'm a Sunni everyone.  You're a Sunni.  Uh.  Yeah.  Let's see.  I'm trying to pick up keywords in the article.  I don't know.  Syria.  Shiite of course.  Yes.  Sunnis.  Yes.  Yes.  Well at least the President of the United States will be here in New York today.  Probably going to the UN to address this and make sure things are handled.  I know where you're going.  What?  He's actually on the ninth hole.  No no.  He's coming to New York.  Oh he is? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  His golf game is over?  Yeah.  I just assume it's to go to the UN and maybe get some people together that would maybe take  care of this issue.  Where?  Oh no.  That's right.  He's at a gay lesbian bisexual tranny fundraiser.  Where?  In Manhattan somewhere.  He's in Manhattan again?  Yes.  Stay away.  He can't stand.  I remember a time and you know when a President came to your city it was kind of cool.  A whistle stop tour.  Whether you liked the President or didn't like the President it was like there was an energy 
[00:42:30]  it was kind of cool.  Yeah.  Now it's just pain in the ass.  Now it's a major fucking hassle for everybody.  Go.  Stay away.  Big pain in the ass.  Go to Randall's Island or something.  Yeah.  It's not really interfering with everybody.  You could like land a helicopter there and you know it won't bother anybody's fucking  day.  They shut everything down just in case he's going to go somewhere or he has to get somewhere.  Contingency routes and stuff.  So when he's leaving to go back to the airport or the heliport or wherever the fuck he's gone 
[00:43:00]  they close all kinds of roads.  See I think we've said it in the past you know it's gotten to the point where it's too  much of a hassle to move the President around so he shouldn't be doing all these trips.  Yeah.  He should only be doing the really important ones I guess.  Because in the old days yeah they only had a few cars.  I know the JFK thing might have wrecked that for some presidents.  But I mean what was the detail on that?  I know.  Compared to what it is today.  In this fucking day and age they should be sending a hologram. 
[00:43:30]  That's what I think.  Stern is watching the gay Billy Squire video now?  What?  Why?  What is this fucking guy doing?  Huh?  Josh in Jersey.  Hey what's up guys?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up Rhett?  What's up?  You guys were talking about the Billy Squire video the other day.  Yeah.  So I'm just checking Twitter and Stern is doing the same thing on his show.  Oh.  That's right.  That's a weird coincidence.  No one has talked about Billy Squire in decades and we talked about it a mere two days 
[00:44:00]  ago.  Yeah.  Maybe Tim Sabian is giving us some ideas.  All right Josh.  Thanks.  Thanks.  I was having a little battle with that mental patient fucking.  Who Sabian?  No.  That's funny.  What?  No.  That one that called us that day.  That one that called us that day from Stern's show.  That fat.  I don't even know.  Fat.  The guy with the weird voice.  I don't know what he is.  Hansy. 
[00:44:30]  Hansy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Last night on Twitter a little bit because he was just getting a little rambunctious  and you know.  Right.  So I was just telling them that people were watching him and the Illuminati's watching  him and then I just put letters and numbers at the bottom of my post.  Oh boy.  Good.  Good for you.  Good for you.  Then I blocked him again.  So fuck it.  Where were we?  Yeah.  We were talking about the Sunnis.  Where were we?  You went to Sunni Geneseo.  I went to Sunni Geneseo.  Right.  Why are you laughing?  I see.  The president. 
[00:45:00]  Oh the president itself.  It is a pain in the ass but when you see that motorcade come through it's an impressive  sight.  As much as I just posted about it.  I've been in the front row three times now.  Yeah.  One for Bush and twice for Obama.  When that thing comes flying through.  Wow.  Pretty amazing.  That is damn impressive.  But everyone has to suffer today because he's in town.  Do you know there are two Air Force Ones?  There are two of the fucking things.  Really?  When he goes to like Europe and stuff, they fly both of them over there. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  Just in case.  He has a spare 747.  Just in case.  Can't they find something over there?  Especially Europe?  Sometimes, you know, they're in one of those countries like when he went to South Africa.  Right.  What do you find in a plane as fancy schmancy as Air Force One when you're over there in  South Africa?  That's very, very true.  Crazy.  That's crazy.  Speaking of Africa, I guess...  Oh yeah! 
[00:46:00]  World Cup, motherfucker!  You're a World Cup guy now?  I bleed red, white, and blue.  You're a World Cup guy?  World Cup goal, motherfucker!  Yeah, Ghana!  Ghana knock you right the fuck out!  Yeah, haha!  Enough Ghana jokes on Twitter yesterday.  Holy fuckaroni.  Pete Radovich, he wrote me back.  Yeah!  I was in a bar, hanging out, drinking, watching the game with the rest of the people.  I watched a little bit.  Oh yeah?  It was alright. 
[00:46:30]  That's my trick.  It was just okay.  Pete Radovich is mad though because...  We were talking about soccer yesterday and he was so mad, he texted me and said something  like, you're killing me with this soccer thing.  So then we put him on the phone.  We put him on the phone.  He works for CBS Sports.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's like, come on, just at least give it a try.  Give it a try!  I gave it a try!  It's just okay!  And he...  Just okay?  He texted me this morning, please tell me you watched that game.  I did.  I watched.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  So...  Yeah, yeah, you watched and done.  I watched.  Come on.  I even watched the winning goal.  That was exciting right there.  It sure was.  Fucking kicked it and it went in.  So, you know, for two minutes the game was kind of fun.  Yeah.  I don't...  I don't know, man.  And I think a lot of people that are running around with this soccer fever are lying because...  Come on!  I was at a...  I was at an outdoor...  Not even a restaurant.  I was just getting a plate of food.  I get a...  What's called...  It's a chicken plate, basically.  A nice Mediterranean chicken plate. 
[00:47:30]  Mmm.  That's one of my...  Rice?  A little salad on the side.  Shit's good.  Better than most of the restaurants in my town.  It's just a...  Sounds Greek.  It...  Yeah, it is Greek.  Olives?  A lot of olives.  See?  And they put some pickles in that salad, too.  Ooh!  Mix it all up.  It's nice.  We should get some in here to eat.  The audience loves it.  Alright, we could do that.  And...  I would rather eat this chicken plate than at most of the restaurants in my neighborhood.  It's that damn good.  Yeah.  I'll say I'm such a dick. 
[00:48:00]  We'll explain later.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll explain later.  Stop it, Sam.  Of course.  So...  But I'm right...  I'm outside, and I'm right next to another restaurant with outdoor tables.  And there was a bunch of 20-somethings.  If I had to guess, they were about 24, 25.  And the game is on in the restaurant.  But they can't see the game.  But they hear some kind of cheering.  Yeah.  It was early on.  I didn't see the whole game, I'll be honest with you.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, there was a little cheering.  So maybe it was the first U.S. goal. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And the one girl, it was like out of a skit.  She goes, I love soccer.  And then everyone around the table is like, yeah, me too.  I love it.  I love soccer, too.  And I'm sitting there like, you don't love soccer.  No, you don't love soccer.  I think it's just the cool thing to do now is to say I love soccer.  Because if you love soccer, wouldn't you be inside next to the TV watching?  Where were all these people when we were watching it years ago before everyone jumped on the bandwagon?  That's what I want to know.  What?  Pele?  Exactly. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  We almost got into soccer in this country because of Pele.  I remember that.  I say bring on Paraguay, Nick.  Peru?  Who?  Portugal, I think.  Portugal?  Yeah, but you've got to say it differently.  Because it's the World Cup, you've got to say it differently.  Portugal?  Portugal?  Portugal?  Portugal?  I don't know.  But my point is, they're sitting there going how much they love soccer.  You don't love soccer.  They're not even watching them.  It's just a cool thing to say, I guess, and write on your Facebook page or something.  It is.  It's like everything else.  As long as, you know, you can put a hashtag in front of it and sound like you're in whatever's 
[00:49:30]  going on.  Right.  What happened to those girls that were stolen there in Nigeria?  All of a sudden, no one is talking about them anymore.  They're still missing.  Are they?  Yeah.  But it's time for a World Cup hashtag.  It's a World Cup hashtag now.  We just live in this time of days and maybe a week.  Hashtag.  That's sick.  Where is Pat? 
[00:50:00]  Where is he?  I see him out there.  Is he in the green room?  Oh, he's right outside?  He's got a Jaws hat on.  Oh, Jesus.  We should get him in here.  Pat Monaghan from Train, of course, our good friend.  Come on, man.  I saw him in the hallway last week.  Last week I said, hey, man, when are you going to do our show?  Yeah.  And then he said, I'll be back in New York and I'll come in and do your show.  Stay up to.  What's up, Pat?  How you doing, Pat?  Take a seat over there.  I love the Jaws hat.  Everyone.  Where'd you get the Jaws hat from?  I got it in Maui. 
[00:50:30]  Nice.  I've never seen a Jaws hat.  Yeah, yeah.  This is...  I don't know why I liked it so much.  Right.  My wife kind of found it and I was like, I'll wear it.  Yeah.  Oh, Maui.  How are you guys?  It was a good seat.  We're pretty hyper.  It was good to see you guys last week and then I didn't get the chance to come in.  I know.  So thanks again for re-inviting me.  Oh, no worries.  I saw you coming out of the bathroom like, hey, what are you doing here?  No problem.  Come on in and say hi.  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about everything.  Yeah.  Are you into the World Cup?  I'm really into it, but I have kids. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  And they're little.  So I chase them around while World Cup starts going on.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  They're not very interested.  Well, no.  How old are your kids?  Well, I have a five-year-old and a two-year-old.  Oh, you're right around the same as me.  Yeah.  Basically, you can't watch TV.  No, no, no.  See.  I can't imagine that.  You cannot watch TV.  It would drive me crazy if I couldn't watch television.  I mean, you could watch TV, but it's going to take at least twice the time.  So, yeah.  I was watching the finale of Game of Thrones the other day. 
[00:51:30]  How long is it on HBO?  How long is it?  An hour?  It was about 75 minutes.  75 minutes would be, I'm not even joking.  That would probably be three hours with somebody with young kids.  My phone was on the armrest of the couch.  Right.  And during the show, it went, bling, that a text came in.  Right.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  Right.  Like, I couldn't imagine a kid running around interrupting.  Well, first, you've got the little one, the littler one. 
[00:52:00]  You've got to get her to bed.  Oh, my.  So, this is what you have to do to watch TV.  You get the little one to bed.  She's good.  You know she's out for the night.  Okay.  And then you've got to set up the other one, mine's four, in another room with his TV show.  And he's good.  Uh-huh.  You even get him snacks and everything.  But he'll come out about 20 times to say, one question.  I got one question.  That comes out, you've got to pause everything.  He prefaces it with, I have one question.  Because he's sort of aware that we're trying to watch something.  But he'll do the, I got one question about... 
[00:52:30]  That's great.  Maybe not 20 times, but he'll do it.  Excuse me.  Excuse me, sir.  You should be like the president.  I'm not taking any more questions.  Right, right.  Thank you.  And then he runs back into his room and he's good for maybe 10 minutes.  Then he comes back because he has another one question.  That's so amazing that he's aware of it.  Because my daughter is five and she'll come in and she's like, I don't give a shit what  you guys are doing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's time for me to ask some stuff.  You will.  I am the important thing here.  Oh, it's my time.  Plus I need to dance and sing four songs before I go back in. 
[00:53:00]  And then I just go like, forget it.  We'll watch the movie when she's 20.  Right.  You're just the oddest things.  I couldn't imagine.  It's quite a joy, but it's also kind of frustrating.  It's quite a joy.  It's kind of frustrating at times.  Trying to watch the same way.  Everybody that I know, though, is huge into Game of Thrones.  Like, that's all I care about.  That's the big show.  Huge.  Seven million people watched the finale, the season finale.  That's amazing.  And then you add on the replays and it was something like nine million viewers.  Really?  Is that on HBO?  Yeah, and that's on HBO. 
[00:53:30]  It set a record for the most watched HBO show.  I've always seen it.  And they had The Sopranos?  Really?  Yeah, I know.  It just shows, like, what good fucking shows are out there now.  And, you know, it's like a movie.  They've had a few shows between The Sopranos and Game of Thrones as well.  Very well, too.  They've never gone away, this HBO.  I'm into also Boardwalk Empire.  But that whole thing is taking over movies, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's kind of like you get a nine-hour movie instead of a movie.  Yeah.  I kind of like that, too. 
[00:54:00]  It's taking over.  You really get to develop characters and, you know, you can kill off important people  without ruining the movie.  Yeah.  Because it gives you time to build up another character.  I kind of like it.  What's a movie?  Exactly.  And that's another thing.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If I go to a movie now, it's only IMAX, 3D, like, shit I cannot do at home at some point.  There really is a market to bring, you know, the real movies into your home.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  First run.  First run.  There is such a market for, you know, for parents.  I don't really care if I see them right away, though, anymore.  Because you're seeing them relatively soon after it was done.  I remember years ago, I've told this, too, when I saw Planet of the Apes as a kid in the  movie theater.  It was at the RKO in Comac.  Right.  Wow.  And when Mommy came to pick me up, I was just thinking, how long is it going to be before  I get to see that again?  It was over a year. 
[00:55:00]  And it was well over a year.  Yeah.  It was like five years before television got some kind of rights to big, major motion pictures.  I remember, in general, it was over a year.  Because for the most part, you were seeing, like, TV was playing old 50s horror movies,  Godzilla, Wolfman movies, things like that.  And for a first run movie to premiere on television, it was crazy.  You had to go to the movie theater.  You had to to see the movie or you weren't, you know.  Right.  You weren't cool.  Yes. 
[00:55:30]  You were a dick.  You were a dick.  So I want to get back to Jaws and Maui.  Yeah.  Do you surf?  No.  I mean, I can surf.  When I lived in LA, I got up on the, you know, but my wife.  I choose not to.  I could surf.  She's like, I hang out with people that are just so much better than I am at it that it  just gets frustrating.  Yeah.  Oh, so your wife could surf?  Yeah.  She can do everything.  Really?  Twice as fast, twice as good.  No kidding.  Yeah.  It's a bummer.  But I mean, you know, but I love it about her.  But you could sing pretty good. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  That's true.  But, uh, but I love going to Maui.  It's kind of my, I'd love to just move there and everybody that I like run into, I ran  into Todd Rundgren at the hotel in here in New York.  Todd Rundgren.  Right.  He lives in Maui.  Like most of those guys live in Maui now.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Like Crosby stills and Nash.  They're all there.  It seems like a good place to go and kind of chill out away from everything.  Yeah, it really is.  I've never been just cause the flight.  You've never been to Maui.  Never been to Hawaii or anywhere. 
[00:56:30]  See, but you guys.  It's just the flight's too long.  From New York, you go to the Bahamas, right?  Really?  Yeah.  Solid places down there.  The way to go.  I figured I saw the Brady Bunch episode, so I don't even need to go.  Yeah.  No, that's a good, that's a good point.  See?  I know.  Yeah.  Cause then you'd probably get a weird necklace.  Yeah.  I saw the whole thing.  Tiki kind of scared me.  Why is it so cool?  Are the people nice?  Yeah, man.  Obviously the scenery.  We've all seen the pictures.  Yeah, everything is really great about it.  But I think all the islands.  I love Kona. 
[00:57:00]  Hawaii is like my little place away from everything.  Right.  It's the only place I can actually relax.  Right.  Because when I'm home, I feel like I'm either doing kids stuff or stressing about work.  Right.  Yeah.  But when I go to Maui or any island, it feels like, okay, you're allowed this amount of  time before you have to stress again.  Right.  Even if I'm taking care of kids stuff, it's fun cause we're in the water.  That water's scary though cause it's so, like, there's so much nature in there. 
[00:57:30]  There's something to be said for growing up on Long Island beaches where you know,  what are you going to do?  Step on a clam shell or, you know, you know something giant and exotic isn't going to bite  you.  Right.  I mean, just about everything is scared of you.  Ha ha ha.  I'm just, all that.  Put all that to the people with bites.  My brother-in-law showed me a YouTube video yesterday.  That's fake.  About the guy in Australia.  Have you seen it?  Yeah.  Where he jumps in with the GoPro on his head.  Yeah, I think that's fake.  Oh, you do? 
[00:58:00]  I do think that's fake.  People's reaction, I don't think he'd be focusing so well on the shark and be that petrified.  Huh.  He'd be trying to get out of the water as quickly as possible and not turning around,  going back under water with his head.  Right.  Huh.  And looking at the shark.  You too, you think it's fake?  I think it's fake.  Oh, wow.  There's so many good CGI things and layering that's done now.  I don't know.  You're gullible, man.  You want to believe it.  And you got a Jaws hat.  I would have believed it if the shark had a GoPro on it. 
[00:58:30]  You put a fucking GoPro on a shark, man.  This shit's real.  Yeah.  I heard it.  That was funny.  And you got a Jaws hat on.  And you got a Jaws hat on for the love of you guys.  Man, I bought this Jaws hat after I saw the video and you're telling me it's fake.  Yeah.  Throw the hat now.  A lot of people think it's real.  I think it's fake too.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's just the way it looks good.  I think in the beginning of the video, his friend looks the wrong way.  And that threw me off.  Hey, over there. 
[00:59:00]  No, right.  And then he's looking the other way.  I'm like...  And here's another thing.  When you see real videos of things that happen that are out of the ordinary, frightening,  dangerous, they never look like that.  They never come off like that.  They never catch it from beginning to end.  Right.  It's always you wish they would have focused better or moved the camera.  It looks too good.  Right.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Like everything else is all fucked up.  It looks kind of like a GoPro commercial.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very good. 
[00:59:30]  It might be.  Just get a GoPro hat.  That'd be interesting.  Dude.  Yeah, yeah.  That's so smart if it is.  Yeah.  You banked some money off a commercial.  Yeah.  That train song was everywhere for like a year straight.  Oh man, especially in this area.  Drive by and with the Yankees games and everything.  Yeah.  Or the Ford commercials during the Yankee games.  Yeah, you guys were smothered in that song.  Sorry about that.  Does that pay well?  You don't have to give us numbers.  You know, sometimes it pays the record company really well.  Oh, yeah.  It's a good time for them to get their money back and everything. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  But when you recoup the money that you're using from a record company, yeah, it ends up  meaning a lot.  Yeah, that's good.  If they could make their money back that way and then you guys can start actually making  money off of a deal instead of paying back the man.  I do a podcast and I've had a lot of musicians and pro athletes, et cetera.  You know, I'm not good like you guys are, but I faked through it.  And one of the most interesting podcasts I did was two radio guys from Columbia Records. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  Because I got to talk to them about what it's going to be like for these kids coming in.  And is there any future in record sales or record companies?  I don't think so.  And, you know, they're very optimistic about it because they have great jobs.  They work radio and radio they feel is going to continue to have to matter for a lot more  years.  But you guys make your money differently than, you know, guys before you.  We make our money in a lot of different ways, but touring is basically where you end up. 
[01:01:00]  And a lot of record companies did 360 deals with their artists from, you know, signing  probably 10 years ago to now that they make you give them part of your T-shirts.  Holy fuck.  Ticket sales.  God, they're not getting enough.  Well, no, they're not because they're the record companies are suffering too.  So they're trying to figure out how to make their money.  They're so hurting.  Record companies are not what it used to be.  Well, Spotify is not helping, helping you guys. 
[01:01:30]  A lot of people just, you know, but I don't know.  It's kind of like iTunes when, when, when iTunes came out, everybody wanted to kill iTunes  or wherever, you know, when Napster came out, everybody wanted to kill that first.  And now it's like why we can get everything we want, you know, and I'm just as much a  Victor, a part of participant in Spotify and loving it.  And right.  Like if that means that I get less money because I can listen to every Paul Simon song  and every new Irish band that I want in the world, like I'm cool with that. 
[01:02:00]  When you're sitting around though, and you think of a band and an album that you want,  and you can instantly buy that album off of iTunes.  I would think that helps at least the record company, doesn't it?  I mean, they're, they're making.  Yeah.  But a lot of kids aren't buying them anymore.  Well, there's a lot.  That's the problem that they're subscribing.  So they're not really spending that much money on their music.  Yeah.  And there's a lot more ways to pull funds for a record company now.  So Spotify and all of those, you know, Pandora, they have to pay. 
[01:02:30]  Licensing.  It's gotta be paid.  Yeah.  There's, there's gotta be somebody who gets paid.  And so the artist seems to be the one that really is at the bottom of the totem pole getting  fucked.  I have been and I'm not, I'm not gonna complain because I've, you know, I've done fine by  just working, working hard through all of it.  But like, if I would have, if we would have had one successful record and then I would  have quit the music business, I would certainly need a job.  A little job on the side.  A real job. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  No.  You guys got a good run going, man.  Jeez.  So far, man, you know, I, I, I don't know how long this lasts, you know, I just, uh,  How many years have you guys been doing it now?  20 years.  It is, right?  Yeah.  That's what we're up to.  Yeah.  20 year mark, man.  20 years.  Yeah.  It's nuts.  You look at each other and you go like, what happened to you?  You look like shit.  And they're thinking the same thing.  Man, 20 years did not treat you well at all. 
[01:03:30]  Some fucking business.  We've been around long enough to see some drastic changes in our business.  You've been long enough to see drastic changes in yours, certainly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The way things are delivered, digital delivery now, even in our job too.  The amount of anybody doing a podcast as opposed to, you know, just the, the few radio  stations with jocks that talk.  Well, we take it for granted now.  But when we started, you, you want it to be really big in the city you were in.  Right. 
[01:04:00]  And then if you were lucky, they might syndicate you to what, like a, one more city.  One more city.  Yeah.  Fast forward.  We're, we're taking this for granted.  Like people right now are hearing us in LA and, and everywhere in between.  And then online, they're listening.  You know, we get calls.  I mean, I don't know if like, yeah, we got small pockets of fans around the world too.  To me, here's what the best part about today is as opposed to when, uh, we all started.  I can leave here and go to Twitter and read all of the, Hey asshole from train. 
[01:04:30]  I heard you on Opie and Anthony.  I think you suck.  Right.  And that's great for me.  Right.  Cause I can just see that instantly instead of have to wait.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  And now you can.  Right.  You know.  A letter.  Instant.  I hope my letter finds you well.  Instant abuse.  Yay.  We're all so lucky.  I cannot say I enjoyed your appearance.  Like written in oldie civil war speak.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  I can't believe people used to have to pen that out.  Yeah.  Man.  I love that.  I love it too.  That's a great, like new Twitter vibe.  Yeah.  Just be that guy on Twitter.  Just be the old civil war letter guy.  I hope this letter finds you well.  But Delia has succumbed to consumption.  As I was listening to my.  Oh, these, these assholes will go, you know, the first three hours were good.  Exactly. 
[01:05:30]  Then there was about 15 minutes there that I didn't like at all.  Here's my favorite.  Here's my favorite.  You fucking dudes totally lost touch with your fans.  You don't even know what we want anymore.  Oh, you get that too.  And then, and then.  P.S.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  That's my favorite thing to read.  Like when I read other people's hate on other things, like it's always like you lost  touch.  It's amazing.  You guys ever get the, hey man, you sold out.  Oh, of course.  Sold out.  But I just read one the other day that was like, it's official. 
[01:06:00]  The band that wrote, uh, meet Virginia and drops of Jupiter is dead.  You like, oh, that's sweet.  All right.  Thanks.  This thing on Twitter now where if somebody writes something like here, for instance,  this is what happened last week.  Literally.  Some guy wrote trains new album coming out is called, I don't know how he got this many  letters on Twitter.  Uh, it's called, uh, bulletproof Picasso.  I like the original name. 
[01:06:30]  Train is a shit in a Barnes and Noble toilet because it was a funny enough tweet.  I was like, Hey, I know what I'll do.  All right.  I'll retweet, but I'll change a couple of the words.  Right.  Where I turned it into train.  Uh, I liked the original title.  Train is awesome.  Right.  And then I just wrote, thanks buddy.  So that all of our fans are seeing this.  And then he writes, Oh my God, train just made me look like a total asshole to my friends. 
[01:07:00]  So it's like my new thing I'm going to do.  It's just a lot of fun.  I sit in bed and just laugh.  He can't possibly reach as many people anyway.  No.  And he was like, you won this round.  And I'm like, I'm pretty sure I'm never going to get you next time.  Yeah.  No, this is good.  I think you're done with him.  You're not going to be searching him out every time.  That's funny.  Wow.  What a spinal tap type review that was.  Shark sandwich.  A simple two word review.  Shit sandwich.  Right.  Right. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, fuck.  What are you doing in New York?  I'm here to, we're going to have this really great girl from the UK sing on a track today  so we can be done with the album.  And then we're going to master the album on Friday.  Oh, so it's coming out soon.  Well, the album will come out on the 16th of September.  Right.  That's, you know, that's soon enough.  But the single just, it's a week old.  Where'd you find the Goyle?  You know, through my managers.  Yeah.  She's really, I think she's, her name is Marsha. 
[01:08:00]  I can't remember how to spell her last name so I'm just going to keep it to Marsha.  Oh, Marsha.  That's fine.  He's really a great singer.  Cool.  Yeah.  We'll play the single.  Hell yeah.  In a little bit.  Oh, hell yeah.  Hey.  What are you guys doing in New York?  A little of this.  A little of this.  A little of this.  A little of this.  All our friends get to travel the world and they come back and see us.  Yeah.  We just sit here and rot every day.  That is true.  Once a year they allow us to go broadcast somewhere else. 
[01:08:30]  No Jim today, huh?  No.  No.  Jimmy Norton is filming his TV show for Vice.  Oh, nice.  He's doing a show for Vice.  Oh, that's great.  He'll be back either.  He hustles, man.  He's a hustler.  A lot of those dudes hustle.  Oh, yeah.  You gotta hustle.  Crazy.  He's constantly working.  We don't hustle.  You think it would have been easy for you guys to just do, like, stand-up?  No, man.  I mean, it's all brutal, right?  No.  No.  Yeah.  That's frightening stuff, stand-up.  I have an audience and do a few little things here and there, but no, I respect those guys 
[01:09:00]  for what they do.  The way they talk about bombing is astounding to me.  It's like, how can you make fun of it and be like, oh, yeah, so then I went there.  Oh, God, I bombed the crowd.  I'm like, how are you not, like, hiding a year later and still just saying I'm not ever  gonna do that again?  Yeah, no.  It's crazy.  I was at a radio station in New Jersey the other day, and I was like, man, you know,  you remind me of Doug Stanhope. 
[01:09:30]  He's my favorite comic because he's so dark.  Right, right, yeah.  And this guy's like, man, I know Doug.  I used to do stand-up with him.  And so we started rapping about this thing that, like, these salty, you know, comics,  they do, and I'm sure Jim plays this game, too.  It's called The Walking Game.  You know about it?  No, I don't.  You just go like, all right, we're in Tulsa.  There's 30 people.  We're four comics.  Let's see who can make more people leave.  Oh, shit. 
[01:10:00]  Nice.  The Walking Game.  Walk the room.  Right, right, right.  Walk the room.  Yeah, those guys do that.  Yeah.  That's rude.  They certainly have versions of that.  Yeah, you just start saying shit that nobody wants.  They are not even you.  It's odd because there's got to be a confidence in your material to go up there every day  and know that even if you bomb, the material's still good.  Go up and do it again.  Yet, they're the most unconfident people when they're just hanging out comics. 
[01:10:30]  They're fucking weirdos for the most part.  They're extremely strange.  Yeah.  I tell the story about Jimmy when we were off the air.  I wandered around with him a little bit, and he was doing sets in the city.  And he did a set somewhere, I forget exactly, and he killed it.  I mean, almost like a standing ovation, but they didn't feel like standing, whatever.  And then he went to do another spot.  This is what these guys do.  They'll do six in a night, no problem.  So he goes to Dangerfields on the east side.  Does the exact same, I mean exact, because he's working on material for a CD at the time. 
[01:11:00]  He didn't get one laugh.  I'm like, that's fucked up.  Isn't that weird?  Maybe not one laugh.  That's torture, right?  It was a completely different reaction for the same exact material.  I mean, that just sounds like a terrible existence.  There's no rhyme or reason to that.  I don't know.  How do you then gain confidence what you just did when it's like, what is it?  Is it soccer?  Is it grade?  What the fuck?  Yeah.  It was so strange.  Most musicians, we're all touched by something crazy weird, too. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know.  Like, I think we all, well, at least I spend most of my time like trying to douse the self-loathing flame, you know, just like to get enough courage to do it again for the day, you know?  Right.  One of the hardest things for a musician is recording because you hear that song so many times and something that you loved at the beginning becomes like, I don't even know if this is good or jack or what the fuck it is. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Are you a musician?  Yeah, I try.  I mean, that makes all the sense in the world.  But yeah, you sit there over and over and over again.  And then you're like, I don't know.  This is, I loved this song when it was first.  And then it's on the radio.  And then you go like, oh man, this thing's never going to go.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I heard it on the radio that there's no way people are going to like this song.  We suck.  That guy on Twitter was right.  I got to call him. 
[01:12:30]  At that point, you got to promote the new song, but you just don't feel it the same way anymore.  There's no way you could feel it the same way.  Right.  Yeah, it's got to be that way, too, for actors, because they're promoting movies that they finished a year ago, sometimes more than a year ago.  And now you're promoting going, I don't know, was it good?  Right.  They're on to their next project, but they have to go backwards and go, wait, oh, that's right.  I got to push this thing now.  It's an odd existence.  But see, most actors, they don't act like most actors are schlepping dishes and like, well, that's true. 
[01:13:00]  That's the worst job of all time.  Right.  Because even when you get a break, it's only a break for a second.  Right.  And then you got another break you need real bad, because rent's due.  Right.  That's a tough gig.  It is.  Man, think about it.  Dancers make like 300 bucks a year.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a terrible gig, but they're so gifted.  Yeah.  It's entertaining.  You know, you're lucky to get anywhere in any of it. 
[01:13:30]  You know, and you could just sit there and build a birdhouse, maybe.  Yeah.  See what you just built.  Exactly.  Put a price tag on it and sell it.  At least you know you could build another birdhouse.  It is such a, it's a business that it's all about like, me, me, me.  Yeah.  Look at me.  It is.  It really is.  It's really kind of sad and pathetic when you think about it.  It is.  It's sad and pathetic.  I quit. 
[01:14:00]  I quit.  I'm done building a birdhouse.  What would you do if you weren't doing music?  I don't know.  Open a haberdashery.  That's exactly.  I think that's the answer to have, by the way.  To what?  To not know.  Yeah.  Because I think it makes you really like.  I don't know, man.  If you have nothing to fall back on.  I don't know.  I think that kind of helps.  No safety net.  It helps push you forward.  I did it the other way around.  I had a good, like, well, not a good job.  It was a shitty job.  It was a real job for so long that it was, you know. 
[01:14:30]  What was it?  The sheet metal work, tin knocking, installation of duct work and giant air conditioning units.  You make it sound like it's really cool.  It sucked.  It was so bad.  Because, you know, you work in winter and summer and you're the one putting in the stuff  that keeps you either cool or hot.  Right.  So you're either freezing or burning up as you're working.  That sucked.  You're constantly cutting yourself on giant razor blades, for the most part, is what you're  working on.  And it's loud. 
[01:15:00]  And it didn't pay well.  Yeah, that sounds amazing.  I'm surprised you left that.  That sounds good.  Yeah, it was a real decision I had to make when Opie came through with the first gig.  Did you have anything that you could have fallen back on?  I could be a caddy still, probably.  A caddy?  That's the only other job I've ever had.  Do you play golf?  Yeah.  I used to be alright.  Yeah?  Now if I break 100, I'm happy.  Really?  Which I'll do pretty much every time out, but yeah.  I don't need to, you know, to hit the number anymore. 
[01:15:30]  I want to play more golf.  Do you?  Yeah, man.  Golf's great.  I just like a good game of golf.  Golf is awesome.  I love it.  I just don't get out there anymore.  Each time too, but I want to, I want to, I want to beat somebody.  You know what I mean?  With a claw to clear.  With a claw.  First I want to beat him in the score, and then I want to beat him.  Get that shit out with a three-run.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I break 90, I'm really happy these days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're playing a real course and you break 90, you play good golf.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  I'm happy with that.  You know.  Because I mean, 90 is bogey golf, right?  Exactly.  So you're getting a few pars in there.  But actually, nowadays, if I go out, if I just get a few, you know, birdie putts and  a few pars, I'm happy.  Yeah.  That's it.  I'm happy.  I'm just happy.  Whatever.  It's cool.  You can find joy in that.  You know.  If I'm out there and the beer cart comes around more than a few times, I'm happy.  You're happy.  That's all I care about.  I'm happy.  Attractive girl in the beer cart.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  I'm happy.  I loved caddying though.  I did that for like 10 years.  Now winning that caddy tournament.  10 years of caddying.  Yeah.  I started at like 12, 13 years old though.  Did you caddy for anybody who was a real player?  Yeah.  I caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club, which is a club out on Long Island.  And yeah, we had some scratch golfers out there.  Really, really.  After 10 years, you were really caddying them.  You were telling them what club to use.  I knew every inch of the course.  I was handing them clubs.  Yeah, that's great.  Guys that were way better than me, but I'm like, here. 
[01:17:00]  I just, without even thinking.  Wow, that's cool.  I can look at putts and tell them exactly.  Where was this hotel?  Huntington.  Oh yeah, cool.  Exactly how the putt was going to break.  Love it, man.  I knew all the yardage without trees and any of that shit.  You get to walk outside every day.  Sometimes it's a bummer, but most days it's probably great.  Well, they had people come in, what the hell were they called?  Outings.  On Mondays.  And you had to do the outings on Mondays, or you would drop in the ranks.  Caddying is all about, you have to be there all the time, so you rise up in the ranks 
[01:17:30]  and then you get a lot more loops.  You know, there are jobs like that that I think are so respectable.  Right.  They're like service jobs, where people really get good at them.  We kind of ignore them in society.  Yeah, just kind of take it for granted.  But, like, you really have to pay attention.  Yeah, I was like top five.  Like, I was always one of the first five out every day.  And other guys had to wait.  Like, sometimes they would wait six hours just to, you know, finally get on the course. 
[01:18:00]  Just to get a little walkthrough, yeah.  But these outings on Mondays, you had to do them, and it was like a garbage company would  come in for the day, take over the course.  And instead of a four, four and a half hour round, these rounds would take like eight  hours.  It was brutal.  A Long Island garbage cart company would come in?  Yeah, it was brutal.  It must have been an interesting conversation out on the course.  I have no idea anymore.  Give me my nine iron or I'm going to shoot you in the face.  Exactly.  Pat, I'll tell you, you know, I don't know what they're doing nowadays, but there was a  lot of mafia guys when I was caddying there, and they couldn't have treated us nicer. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  They always probably treated you great, huh?  They were way cooler than, you know, the legit guys.  Right.  Those were the assholes.  That's exactly right.  Because they probably, they expected, they probably came up having the dough.  Right.  If you worked hard for those guys, they always overpaid.  Yeah.  Crazy, crazy overpaid.  I'm sure most of you guys didn't start out with anything.  No, no.  You know what I mean?  And that's why you end up there.  Yeah.  Like, I'm willing to do some shit that nobody else wants to do. 
[01:19:00]  Right, right.  Get my hands dirty.  Every once in a while, you would caddy for some of these guys, and they would have guests  right from Italy that did not speak English.  And in your head, you'd be like, why are they on Long Island?  See, like, that's so, such American history that you get to live through that, like, I  don't know if your kids are ever going to care, but you have that story to tell them.  I think that's a cool thing.  And some of these guys would have, their faces would be broken. 
[01:19:30]  I mean, like, stereotypical.  I saw it all.  Like.  But the guys that, you know, from Italy that didn't speak English, they were beyond nice  too.  But I always wondered, why are they here?  Frankie Five Angels' brother.  Right.  He's got the dumb hat on.  And Michael Corleone!  Yeah.  And then every once in a while you would get a huge celebrity that would walk the course  and that would be exciting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the ladies followed him around the entire time. 
[01:20:00]  That's cool.  And a lot of the New York Islanders, because they're all from the area.  Was Joe drinking?  I don't remember anymore.  Oh.  Then there would be other guys.  I hope so.  Usually hammered.  There would be other, oh, Whitey Ford, some of the old baseball guys would play over  there.  Damn.  I loved it.  I absolutely loved Caddy.  You'd get up before the sun, get to the course, smell the fucking grass and have a cup  of coffee and a buttered roll.  And the next thing you know, they call you and you're out.  You're out.  Sounds like Caddyshack. 
[01:20:30]  With the birds.  Chicka, chicka, chicka, chicka, chicka, chicka.  It was just like that.  I love that sound to this day.  Of course.  They nailed that movie.  Yeah, they did.  They nailed it.  That's the sound you heard every morning.  There was something so peaceful about that.  I don't know.  First out, man.  First out rules.  That's the way you want to do it.  Right.  When I play golf, I try to be first out.  Yeah.  Sometimes I'll call and be like, if I can't be first out, I ain't coming in.  That's tough.  Well, you're a celebrity.  They're going to take care of you.  You just want to not wait.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Well, of course.  If you think about the life you live now, as opposed to when you were 20, when it was  like, who gives a shit about five hours?  I'm going to sleep or do this.  That's now a percentage of your life that you can measure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now it's like, that's like half my life.  I don't know what I got left.  Right.  But five hours on the golf course sounds like I'm never going to golf again.  Three hours on the golf course sounds like I can do this again tomorrow.  Right. 
[01:21:30]  A friend of mine thinks like the perfect amount of golf is 12 holes.  That's about right.  He's probably right.  Wow.  That's about right.  Yeah.  That back nine.  You're like, oh man, this is bullshit.  We got these guys.  Right.  By 15, you're done.  You're like, oh.  Going into the back nine though, you're like, all right, let me see if I can keep this  going or beat my front nine score.  And then like, yeah.  A three or four in.  You're like, ah.  Three in when you didn't.  Fuck you.  You're like, I'm good.  Fuck, I'm good.  Right.  We worked for the golf pro too. 
[01:22:00]  So we did some extra work for him as well.  And one of the perks was on weekends when everyone was off the course and we were done  with our job, we could play the course for free.  Yeah.  So we had those little carry bags.  Did you get good at it?  I got really, my brother was really good.  I was in the 80s, low 80s when I was really playing a lot.  Wow.  So I never broke 80 to be honest with you.  But we would take like four or five clubs, you know, just the necessities.  And then we would play 18 holes in probably two hours, maybe less. 
[01:22:30]  Wow.  You must have been hitting.  We would hit and run.  We would hit and run.  We needed to be.  Hit and run.  But I mean, we were young.  Those were the days you could run all day and you didn't even feel it.  Oh, yeah.  Hit and run.  You got a boner the whole time.  Just because you can.  We would run around that course because the sun would be going down because we wouldn't  be able to get out there until, I don't know, six, seven o'clock at night probably.  In the summer though, you know, the sun's out until almost nine.  Seriously though, did you have a boner the whole time? 
[01:23:00]  The whole time.  I had boners while I was caddying for old ladies.  Because it was the time.  I mean, I started when I was 12.  I'm trying to remember exactly.  I think I was about just turning 13 when I started caddying.  And you know, that time as a boy, those boners would pop off.  It had nothing to do with anything going on around you.  Yeah.  It was so embarrassing.  It's only a mind of its own, isn't it?  Would you have to just hold a club in front of you?  I would just, you know, point it up and tie it down.  He was this one.  Right.  You just tie it down. 
[01:23:30]  Tie it down a little bit.  What did you do before music?  I was a house painter.  House painter.  Okay.  Yeah.  You ended up getting pretty good at it.  So I started my own company.  Really?  Wow.  Because there was no way I was going to make it in music the way things were going.  Yeah.  So I think all that was in the San Francisco area.  So I used to like climb up on scaffolding and painted ladies and it was scary and fun.  Right. 
[01:24:00]  Damn.  Yeah.  Inside, outside.  So that's not what I would want to do again.  Inside jobs were nothing.  Yeah.  It's painting the outside of a house that's a bummer.  It seems to me.  Like having to burn paint off of a house and shit like that.  And setting up scaffolding in San Francisco has got to be a bitch.  We never did that.  That was a company that would do that.  How the fuck do you level it?  It's all like connected to the building by like twisty ties from garbage bags and shit.  Maybe a little stronger than that.  Maybe a little.  I don't know so.  Wow.  Really?  I painted one summer in Geneseo. 
[01:24:30]  I stayed up there one summer.  I went to college up there.  It's a miserable job.  Scraping off the old paint.  It would bring you to tears.  These houses up there were really old so I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know how many layers of paint.  Lots.  And they wanted it scraped off before we could paint.  And then I'm getting yelled at by my boss because I'm not doing fast enough.  My fucking boss.  And he knew this was an impossible job.  Yeah.  Because the paint was so thick on this house.  I worked for a guy named Gary Magali. 
[01:25:00]  And he came to me once and he said,  I was born to paint.  Don't fuck this up.  That's a great line.  I was like, man.  Wow.  That guy's awesome.  That's a great line.  You gotta really love painting to think that you were born to do that.  I never understood that.  And he was too, man.  He was good.  Yeah.  He was the best.  I worked for several guys, but nobody was as good as that guy.  I almost had a nervous breakdown painting.  What is it? 
[01:25:30]  Lattice is it called?  Oh, yeah.  Lattice?  Criss-crossy stuff.  Yeah.  Criss-crossy stuff.  That almost brought...  Yeah.  That almost really brought me to tears.  There's no way to paint that properly.  Because it starts dripping and you gotta even that out and you gotta get...  Oh, right.  Because you're almost wiping the brush off on the edges of the woods.  Oh, my...  I don't know how...  There are jobs that I can imagine are worse, like being a mover.  Yeah, yeah.  That'd be a bummer, man.  That'd be a bummer, man.  But everyone's had to do it in their life, you know? 
[01:26:00]  Move smooth.  Move their own shit.  Right.  And it sucks.  I had to move my guitar player the first day I met him.  What?  Wow.  Because he was moving from L.A. to San Francisco and his back went out.  Right.  Conveniently, by the way.  They were like, hey, this is Jimmy.  And I was like, hey, man.  You helped me move the shit up in my...  Fuck you.  Oh, man.  Nope.  That was a really funny start, but we've been good buddies ever since.  Wow, man.  Mmm.  Never liked that shit.  I knew...  Oh!  Moving...  I got one question about the painting. 
[01:26:30]  So, have you run into anyone since being famous that you painted their house?  Yeah, there's one guy that's a drummer and he was, you know, he asks occasionally  if he can, you know, sit in and stuff.  But I, you know, we're just not able to do that very much.  Hey, I got a band.  Thanks.  Yeah.  I had this one kid in my neighborhood.  He, uh, his mom was like, you know, you should go over and see his studio and stuff.  So he did.  And then he came over and he's like, sweet man, thanks for letting me come in.  If you ever want to jam, let me know. 
[01:27:00]  Was he serious?  Because that's kind of funny.  Oh, he was real serious, man.  Because he was like, yeah, okay, probably call you on Tuesday when my mom leaves so we  can jam at her house.  I don't know what to do with that.  It was cute.  Too funny.  There are people that love like, like their job.  Even if most people think it thinks it would suck.  I worked with people in air conditioning that just loved getting up in the morning.  Yeah, man.  And going in and doing that job.  And I would just sit there thinking of anything I could do that wasn't this. 
[01:27:30]  Anything else.  What else could I do besides suicide?  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  Besides suicide.  What can I do?  That's like the least bit, like a little bit creative or fun.  How did you get into this?  How did you get into this?  I mean, that's a big step away from that.  I know, right?  It was a magical melange of news events and timing.  We have been doing this radio show for 20 years because OJ killed two people. 
[01:28:00]  Yes.  That's a fact.  OJ Simpson.  Because that's what made me aware of Anthony.  Anthony had a band at the time and I was on the radio doing song parodies about the case.  And his band, you know, sent in a song that was so much better than anyone else's that, you know, sent stuff in.  And then he came in to perform it.  And that's all I was thinking at the time.  Like, oh, wow, you know, I played their song a lot.  And people were like, wow, that's really good.  Do you remember the parody book again?  Oh, God. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  It was actually Gunna Electric Shock OJ.  And it was just sitting on the dock of the bay.  It just seemed to work.  And then we, you know, after the song, we started talking a little bit on the air.  And there was some kind of chemistry there.  And I just started inviting Ann in.  And then 20 years later, still doing this fucking thing.  Well, that's cool.  What was your show called before it was?  Oh, The Nighttime Attitude, Pat.  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  The Nighttime Attitude.  I was doing that.  Yeah, that's a good one. 
[01:29:00]  He goes, yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Eating some danger dogs.  That's right.  That's great.  But isn't that weird, though?  I mean, OJ literally had to kill two people for us to meet.  I know, yeah.  That's really sweet of him.  At this show.  Who knows?  I mean, how does that shit work?  Would we have met anyway?  You know, that's the...  Because you were in the area, and maybe there would have been something else that...  The big question.  Who knows?  You would have keyed in on our Long Island Lolita song. 
[01:29:30]  Right, right.  Exactly.  Our Amy Fisher tune.  Right.  Everybody's got an Amy Fisher song.  Oh, yeah.  Well, back in the day.  It was...  Yeah, yeah.  Was she the one who snipped the...  She shot Mary Jo.  Mary Jo.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Buttafuco.  The other one was...  Who's the girl that snipped the dong?  Yeah.  Oh, that was Bobbitt.  Bobbitt.  John Wayne Bobbitt.  What was her name, though?  Was it a porno, like, five years after?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Lorena Bobbitt. 
[01:30:00]  Lorena Bobbitt, that's right.  There were so many odd stories back then from Long Island.  That's a really...  You got a dark spot that you can't get any light to that.  And drove away with it and threw it out the window.  And they found it.  How they found it.  They found it.  Amazing.  Can you imagine your dick is somewhere else and they actually say,  good news, we found it?  We found your dick.  Oh, yeah, my, yeah, my, yeah.  Could you imagine?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, you're the guy that lost the dick, right?  Yeah.  We found a dick.  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:30]  Now we're assuming it's yours.  I mean, it might not even be a dick.  Don't get excited.  I mean, we found a dick.  A dick.  Yeah.  I think we can assume it's yours at this point, but...  They attached it and it worked fine.  Yeah.  And then I think you got the surgery where you could pull a little out.  Oh.  You know about the surgery where you could pull a little out?  Yeah.  Cut the tendon.  Cut the tendon or the ligament over there and you could pull it out a little bit like  a cord in a vacuum cleaner.  That sounds great until you're like fucking 60, 70 years old and gravity's been tugging 
[01:31:00]  on that ligament-less dick.  Yeah.  I think you need a little of that inside you.  Boy, I look good.  Look at me.  Well, not in that way, but...  Right.  I mean, not that.  The other parts.  It's probably just hanging like a...  I think at that point you gotta work on your technique.  Yeah.  Why...  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Learn how to use what you got instead of like...  People have lived through some terrible things in the public eye, haven't they?  And have to...  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  I mean, that's a tough thing to live through.  Had their name on it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's like, you know, John Wayne Bobbitt.  You're the guy.  You're the guy that got your dick cut off.  Like you're forever.  Yeah.  But it seems like he didn't have much going on before that.  No.  And it became his thing.  He became pretty famous because of that.  Yeah.  Right.  He really did.  He embraced it.  He embraced it.  He embraced it.  I imagine not wanting to trade that in for...  Right.  ...keep me out of the whole thing.  Yeah.  Keep me anonymous and out of the whole thing.  Good point.  I'm good right here in this little apartment with nothing in it. 
[01:32:00]  Well, good.  If I have to trade that for losing my dick, it's no trade.  I won't do it.  Well, we gotta take a break.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  Yes, sirree.  What are you doing?  I'm gonna go do some recording with this girl in a minute.  Nice.  Recording.  Thanks so much for having me into your show, man.  Oh, no problem, man.  No, I was happy to see you in the halls the other day, because you guys were always cool  to us.  Yeah, no, you guys are always cool to us.  There's not much I can do for you.  Hell no, man.  You helping us out is way more than I can see you. 
[01:32:30]  You know what you can do for us?  Come in and play again.  Yeah, that was great.  People loved that.  Yeah, when the guys are back around, for sure, I love that.  Yeah, let's set that up.  So, let's promote the new single, Angel in Blue Jeans, right?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Off the upcoming Train album, Bulletproof Picasso, which is out in September.  It's Patrick Monaghan.  We'll play the song, and we'll see you soon.  Great.  Thanks again.  Thank you.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
[01:33:00]  And though I never got her name or time to find out anything, I loved her just the same.  And though I rode a different road and sang a different song, I'll love her till my last breath's  His breath's gone like a river made of silver.  Everyone came running to the scene.  I was shot down in cold blood by an angel in blue jeans. 
[01:33:30]  Late that night she got away, I chased her to the turnpike and lost her way and the music never plays. 
[01:34:00]  And though I rode up on the stones, I fell into the water, I loved her till my judgment day.  Like a sunrise made of white lies, everything was nothing as it seems.  I was shot down in cold blood by an angel in blue jeans.  I hear voices calling all around 
[01:34:30]  I keep falling down  I think my heart could pound right out of me  I see a million different ways  To never leave this maze alive  I woke up in somebody's arms 
[01:35:00]  Strange and so familiar  Where nothing could go wrong  Barely alive or nearly there  Somehow awakened my own bed  And there you are  Like a highway  Heading my way  Life is but a dream  I was shot down  By your love 
[01:35:30]  My angel in blue jeans  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Combing through their 20-year history, this is an Opie and Anthony radio gem.  What about Barry Manilow?  Now, you lived with Barry Manilow?  Briefly. 
[01:44:00]  Briefly?  What do you mean by that?  This one's for you wherever you are.  What do you mean briefly there, Tippy?  What happened?  Let us know about the relationship there.  Well, the relationship was this.  I met him at a bar, and I don't know who...  The Copacabana?  No!  Downtown in the village.  Oh.  There he is.  The hottest spot, no Copacabana.  That's Tippy's dancing.  He has the Copa.  Copacabana. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Tippy's showing off his dance moves.  You're always the fashion of the Copa.  His name was Tippy.  He smelt like dogs.  All right, Tippy.  So what...  You met Barry Manilow at a bar?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And then what happened?  Yeah, it was a bar down in the village.  All right.  Okay, one of them bars, and I don't know flaky places.  Oh, really? 
[01:45:00]  One of the...  I think at this point of the story, we should tell everybody.  We have no idea if this is...  Well, I'm a little...  Are you actually trying to say that maybe Barry Manilow isn't a little light in the loafers,  as they say?  Imagine this is Barry Manilow's worst nightmare.  Yeah.  The guy is talking about it.  The guy will kill me.  Yeah.  All right?  All right, so it was in one of these bars, and you made your hand go like this, like...  Like a... 
[01:45:30]  Like...  What do you mean by one of these bars?  Swish.  A little swishy?  Yeah.  A little, uh...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  A little fruity?  Who's fruity?  Are you saying that Barry Manilow might have been a little fruity?  Well, I'm not sure.  Okay.  I...  I...  I...  I...  Allegedly...  I was hoping he would be a little fruity.  Oh.  Because I'm a little fruity myself.  You know?  Yeah, for the new listeners, Timmy Tom is... 
[01:46:00]  A little fruity.  A gay gentleman.  But I think he's actually bisexual, because we've set him up with some women over the  years, and he had no problem with that.  Wait a minute.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Okay, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Let's lift something up right now.  All right.  All right.  I've been in Greenwich Village for almost 15 years.  Me telling me I ain't gonna become a fruit?  What kind of goddamn pineapple do you think I am?  Yeah.  Bye, bye.  Don't let me say a bad word. 
[01:46:30]  Right, right.  No, wait a second.  So you saw him in a bar, and then what happened?  Barry Manilow.  This guy knows how to follow the rules better than Louis C.K.  Okay, all right.  It's been to be said.  I'm telling the truth.  The guy's editing himself.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  We went back to his apartment on Horatio Street.  Uh-huh.  Ooh.  And a dog named Bagel, little Beagle Hound, and I met the dog, and I'm staying there.  And so I spent a couple of days there. 
[01:47:00]  You spent a couple of days at Barry Manilow's house?  Yeah, downtown.  Yeah.  Was there any romance?  Well, of course.  You know what he said?  What?  They all began for nothing?  Of course not.  Now, this is when you were, you know, golden buns, I guess.  Back when I was golden buns.  Uh, well, I still got my buns.  Well. 
[01:47:30]  But the thing is, you know, they're sagging a little bit.  But I'm still golden buns.  I got the nicest ass in this whole studio.  And I'll tell you right now, I see everybody, no ass.  Jimmy's got a nice ass.  No.  No.  Clean the bowl with your socks. 
[01:48:00]  Opie and Anthony are back.  Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Barry Manilow.  Happy birthday.  71 years old.  Oh, is that why we got to hear a little tippy Tom there? 
[01:48:30]  I'm talking about Bagel, you little pigle hound.  And Joe Piscopo.  Should we call Joe?  Oh, boy.  I don't think I have Joe.  Oh, no.  Did Joe give me his number?  Let me look.  Let me look.  Club Piscopo.  No, I don't have Joe.  Well, I have a few Joes in here, but not.  I got Joe DeRosa.  I got the Joe Rogan in here.  Yeah.  I got the brother Joe in here. 
[01:49:00]  What about Joe Pepitone?  No, I don't have Joe Pepitone.  Oh.  I got Joey Paisano.  Oh, Joey P.  Joey P, our old pal.  Ah, yes.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, we'll have to call Piscopo and wish him a happy birthday.  I think we did that last year.  I think that was the last time we talked.  Wow.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  God.  So we were talking about soccer.  Yeah.  And do we have the winning goal? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  We do, huh?  So the U.S. had a big...  Was that a big defeat against Ghana?  I don't think...  I'm not going to sit here in front.  I don't know.  I don't think the United States was really supposed to win.  I know this much.  I think...  Right?  Were they?  No.  They weren't?  What?  No?  What?  I think Ghana has knocked them out of the World Cup...  Yeah.  The last two years.  The last two times, right?  Yeah, but they were ranked higher than Ghana this year.  They are, right?  Yeah.  The fans of Ghana look like...  Everybody...  The fans of Ghana in the stands, they all look like that... 
[01:50:00]  Golemov!  Golemov!  Indiana Jones guy.  Exactly.  Let's play the winning goal.  That's exciting.  Seems to take it.  That's a good answer!  And then they run around in circles. 
[01:50:30]  What happened to the goal part?  I guess that's on the foreign broadcast.  Spanish.  I think that's been has the Univision.  It's incredible.  He couldn't even have dreamt that.  Wow.  USA. 
[01:51:00]  How could you miss?  And that's giant.  It's the size of a pool.  John Brooks does exactly what you're taught to do every single time.  Oh, he got in with his head.  Yeah.  Damn, with his head, yo.  Pretty impressive.  That is kind of crazy.  All right.  I don't know.  That goal is like a two-car garage door.  Right.  How do you miss? 
[01:51:30]  Well, I mean...  You just got to get it that close, and I guess you get it in.  Well, it's very tough to get it that close.  Ah, there's the rub.  There is the rub.  I think they should make the goal twice as big.  Twice as big, but then make the field twice as big.  That sounds good.  Just watch him running out of breath.  And they're allowed to use golf carts.  Oh, that'd be fun.  I might watch.  I don't know what to say.  I don't either.  Because in the end, we don't have a shot.  Well, that's what people are saying.  So that was fun, I guess. 
[01:52:00]  But, you know, maybe this is one of those miracles.  Do you believe in miracles?  Maybe this is one of those miracle teams.  Someone just explain it.  That's all.  What do you mean?  That was exciting.  Oh, right.  That was exciting.  So that's all you had to watch.  That was an exciting play.  But most of the game was just running around.  Right.  That's like an overtime goal.  A lot of running.  Was that an overtime goal?  No.  That was the regulation?  Dude, that field looks as wide as a football field is long. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  It's probably close.  I don't even know.  I don't know.  So someone just call up and explain this to me.  Why it's exciting?  The sport in general.  Explain the sport.  I understand why that particular play for the win was exciting.  I understand that much.  I think you've got to be a little more clear as to what you want from the callers.  Because they'll call up and go, well, you've got to take the ball.  And it's like, no, no.  I don't explain that. 
[01:53:00]  So who was saying?  Was it Pete yesterday saying what they're trying to accomplish and what they're doing?  So what, do you have to stare at individual players that look like ants on the screen because the field's so big?  Yeah.  What are you looking for when you watch the game?  What are you looking at?  Are you paying attention to one player?  It looks like it's one of those sports where it looks like it's just one big pain in the ass.  Or just the ball.  Do you just watch the ball?  I would just watch the ball. 
[01:53:30]  I'd just watch the ball.  But it looks like it's a big pain in the ass.  It certainly does.  It looks like it's really hard to get anything done.  It's one of those sports, no?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Joe in Philly.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi, sir.  I just want to say that Kali Ma reference is spot on.  Their fans were terrifying.  Kali Ma.  Cover your heart, Ingle.  If I had to go to the bathroom at the stadium and I was standing in the urinal next to one of those guys,  I just would not be able to get hard. 
[01:54:00]  It was very frightening.  Yeah.  Hard.  All right.  Thank you.  See, here.  We got one.  Henry in Atlanta.  Henry, go ahead, sir.  Hey, guys.  I mean, soccer's just like hockey.  You got to set up your score opportunities.  You got everybody's working.  I just hate it.  It's so cool for football fans and everything to say that soccer's lame and gay.  I've fucking heard that.  Gay.  Offensive.  It's a good sport.  It's just like hockey on a bigger scale. 
[01:54:30]  And if you got three people in front trying to score, you know, it's hard to do,  even though the net is big.  There's constantly people trying to not let you score.  That's what's so hard about putting it in a two-car garage.  Oh, excuse me.  Why don't they just pick the ball up, run with it, and run into the goal?  Then that would be too easy.  Oh.  I don't understand the rules.  Henry, I'm...  Football is an eight-car garage. 
[01:55:00]  I don't...  I just...  I don't know.  I'm not trying to be...  I'm not trying to be too cool or any of that shit.  No one has been able to really explain this.  No, there are those guys that had that argument back in there,  football soccer's for fags.  If any of one of them would have said it was cool, then they look like a queen.  Yeah, I wouldn't say...  I wouldn't say it's for fags or any of that shit.  And you can't compare American football to soccer, obviously.  It's two completely different sports. 
[01:55:30]  I appreciate the fact that soccer's played around the world,  so the competition is that much greater.  Yes.  When you beat another country, that's better than, I don't know,  Detroit beating fucking Chicago.  Yeah, you're beating a whole other country.  Right.  I see that.  I like soccer hooligans.  I like the idea of the soccer hooligan getting there  and just beating the piss out of the opposing team's fans.  I will say that. 
[01:56:00]  Its popularity is absolutely on the rise,  like Pete Radovich was telling us yesterday.  But there's also so many people that are making believe they like soccer now.  Yeah, yeah.  Go on your Facebook page right now.  We'll cup, yo!  Right.  And they couldn't even name a player.  I couldn't name a player.  I don't even know.  We just watched the winning goal.  Who's the guy that scored the winning goal?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We just watched it.  I have no idea.  I think there's a lot of people faking that part of it.  What's up, Travis?  I don't understand how people could say that it's just as exciting 
[01:56:30]  and it's just like hockey.  No.  No.  You know how many saves the goalkeeper had yesterday?  How many?  Five.  Five!  And then there's like 70 saves.  Okay, so it's not as exciting as hockey.  One goalie or both goalies?  The U.S. guy.  Was he standing on his head?  I don't know.  He was probably just walking around most of the time.  What a dull fucking...  You can't just say like, oh yeah, they set up and they try to score.  It's just like hockey if hockey was played on Jupiter.  Yeah, for two minutes. 
[01:57:00]  But in all fairness, goalies in hockey has gotten down to the point where  the actual space you've got to score on...  That's true.  Their pads are so ridiculously big now.  That makes it tougher.  Those splits they do with those giant pads.  Yeah.  I think they should make the pads a lot smaller in hockey.  Yeah?  Little ones?  Yes, because it's hard to score in hockey as well.  Girl field hockey shin pads?  Yes.  That's all right.  Exactly.  That's it. 
[01:57:30]  Field hockey.  Let's say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  The only time I want to watch field hockey is driving past the school.  I always take a little peek.  We did that bit years ago.  You can't even call him a sick fuck.  No.  A brilliant man came up with field hockey where women bend all the way down and they're wearing  skirts.  They're wearing skirts and they decide, we've got to make those sticks shorter.  Right.  Saw off the top of it. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  That's a brilliant man right there.  And they curl the tip like a bent dick.  Right.  Right.  All horned up just looking at it.  So it looks like they're just chasing dick all day.  How many girls had their first orgasm to their field hockey stick?  It was built for the G-spot.  Yes.  It touches the G-spot.  That's a brilliant man.  And I bet you, I bet you when they first, you know, came up with field hockey, the sticks  were like, you just kind of, they were way too long.  Like, no, man. 
[01:58:30]  These girls are standing up.  And they probably weren't even wearing skirts at first.  They probably were in long pants.  Like, no, man, you get, you know, you got to get rid of the pants so you can move better.  Yeah, and I get those sticks shorter so you can see the ball closer and, yeah, that's  it.  That is a brilliant man.  I feel like that's a Nobel Peace Prize for that guy.  Brilliant.  What's up, Steve?  Oh, listen. 
[01:59:00]  Soccer is gayer than Journey.  But besides that, Anthony, you drive a lot.  Have you seen these missing adult signs, like Amber Alerts for adults?  Oh, yeah, the silver alert, they call.  I mean, this is bullshit.  Because everybody slows down to look at it.  You know, if the guy's an adult, what the hell are we looking for?  I think you're looking for some demented old people walking the streets.  Well, maybe, I don't know, stop putting a GPS on or a fucking locator device. 
[01:59:30]  Like your pet?  You're fucking up my traffic, kid.  I don't have time for it.  I mean, a little kid, all right, I'll look around.  I'm not going to go look around.  A caprice, you know, with a 18-year-old dude.  Yeah, I'm missing.  I would assume those guys want to be missing, too.  Yeah, he's probably had it.  Get the fuck out of the home.  They've had it with their stupid family visiting them every once in a while when they could find the time.  Maybe they was playing kick the can. 
[02:00:00]  And in between family members being there, you know they're getting the shit kicked out of them.  Oh, yeah, nurses fucking smothering them.  Right, they got the angel of death, nurse.  They got all sorts of, like, you know, hidden signals.  Of course, the lucky ones get away.  The hidden signals are, family is in the building today.  Like, that's why when you go and see your, like, you know, your relative in the old age home and their eyes are really crazy, 
[02:00:30]  it's because they're trying to tell you.  Oh, they're, she's blinking a lot.  Right.  She's like, oh, Morse code.  Right.  Because they don't want to vocalize it because they don't know what the fuck.  The nurses standing behind the family shaking their head, no, don't you fucking say anything.  I do like when everybody thinks they're a crime solver when you drive past those signs and it's like,  Amber Alert, it was a Dodge pickup truck license plate.  And for, like, two seconds, you, like, look around, yeah, I could get that guy if I see, and then you're just like, ah, fuck it. 
[02:01:00]  Within five miles, you even forgot the make of the car.  Forgot the plate number.  Yeah, the make of the, you don't even remember the make of the car.  No, you're all in, though.  All in at first.  Fuck, maybe it's in.  I'm going to look around right now.  If I see that car, I'm going to fucking do a pit maneuver.  I'll make him slide out into the guardrail.  Get out of my way, you.  What was the fucking make of the car?  Right.  Oh, we got Amber Alert, Silver, maybe this is a Silver Alert, I don't know what's next. 
[02:01:30]  Ah.  I hear you.  The only Silver Alert I want to see is from Bill Devane.  Whoa.  Buy Silver.  Apparently he's quite the liberal.  Is he?  I was reading that yesterday.  Bill Devane's on Fox News all the time talking about silver.  And the whole commercial is based on the fact that society is in collapse.  Look out, the debt is sky high.  You've got to buy silver.  William Devane says buy silver.  And then he's talking about Obama and everything. 
[02:02:00]  Like, he's really a bleeding heart liberal.  Is he all in with Obama?  Yeah.  So Obama's losing a lot of his pals.  All of his pals.  But it's so weird that Fox News is really the only station that plays him.  And it comes off sounding like, you know, if Obama's so good, why should we buy silver with this panic that you're whipping everyone into?  I was watching Bill O'Reilly last night.  I watched a little Bill O'Reilly.  He's just a dick. 
[02:02:30]  I forget how much of a dick he is.  Because I don't watch him.  I don't watch him a lot.  Yeah.  I don't, you know, I'll flip around.  I'll go to CNN because they're showing the double tornado crap.  Sure.  MSNBC at this point, unwatchable.  For real.  Yeah.  Unwatchable.  It's brutal.  They need to shut down and retool.  And then I went to Fox and he just talks down to his fans.  They're fans.  Yeah.  If you watch Bill O'Reilly, you're a fan.  And he just talks down to you.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  He's a dick.  I also like his...  And he's got a massive audience.  Huge.  He's like the number one watched show.  One of my favorite moves he does is a subject will be coming up.  And you're like, all right, I know where he's going on this one.  Right.  And you know he's just taking the opposing point of what he really believes to shake people up a little bit.  Right.  It's like, you know, this immigration thing.  It's like, oh, boy, he's going to slam them.  Right.  Man, there's some good aspects to...  What?  Right.  What?  But it's more his delivery that I hate. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  He's just...  Very pompous.  Extremely pompous.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, the atmosphere of soccer is entertaining.  The atmosphere.  Not the actual sport.  Lou in, uh, Jersey.  Lou.  Lou.  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Hey.  Hi.  Uh, the actual sport of soccer, I find, to be mildly entertaining, but the reason I believe  that the World Cup is so popular is just, it's more of a party atmosphere when you go and  watch these games. 
[02:04:00]  Uh, I personally...  He's going to Brazil.  See, you guys are all explaining it in a way that proves to me that it's a shitty sport.  Yeah, they're not helping.  See, it's a party atmosphere.  Know why it's a party atmosphere?  There's so much downtime that you're looking around and going, all right, what else can we  do?  Yeah.  We paid for these tickets.  Let's have a little fun.  Well, that's exactly what I'm...  When you go to a hockey game, it's not a party atmosphere, per se, because you're literally  so focused on the ice.  You don't have time to really look around you, unless, you know, two guys are beating the 
[02:04:30]  shit out of each other, then everyone turns around and says, you know, fuck hockey, but...  Anyone ever get knocked out in the stands from a soccer ball?  Doubt it.  No.  No, no, no, no.  See them pucks whipping at you.  Right.  I understand the party atmosphere and all that, and I don't know.  Party atmosphere, what, in your house, watching on TV?  Like, who's going to fucking Brazil?  Well, certainly not me, from what I think I'm doing.  Exactly.  Mostly Americans.  Yeah, a lot of Americans.  They're the ones that can afford it, I guess. 
[02:05:00]  There were a lot of Americans, way more Americans at that game than Guanans.  Guan...  Guan...  Guananans?  Guanans?  Guananans?  Guananese?  Yeah, probably Guananans.  Guananans?  Guananans.  In every city, though, in every town, there's usually a spot where you can go to watch your  favorite team.  Like, I root for Italy, so all the Italians gather together, and you start your chance,  and then everybody starts drinking, and eventually, you know, someone scores, and this past weekend 
[02:05:30]  was fantastic.  We won, so...  Right.  Well, all right.  I'm not looking down at people that enjoy soccer.  It is very, very, you know, popular.  I just never got into it.  The whole thing is, just the fact that people have to defend it so much just says something  right there.  But no one explains it.  I know.  They're still not really explaining it.  Yeah.  This guy...  Whoa.  Boston, what's up? 
[02:06:00]  Hi.  Oh, how do you say your name?  Siobhan.  It's Irish.  Siobhan?  Yeah.  All right.  It almost says slobo.  I don't know what...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do you spell it S-I-O-B-H-A-N?  That's the spell.  Yeah.  I've never heard of this name.  Wow.  Yeah, that's very popular.  Where is that popular?  It's Irish.  That's how you spell that name.  Aye.  Aye.  Have you ever seen that name before?  I might have.  I think I did. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  Somewhere.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  So, you guys are talking about soccer.  I just watched a great documentary about...  There was a segment on it about the racism in soccer and how when a black player...  It's still going on.  When a black player gets the ball, the European countries, the opposing countries, are throwing  banana peels on the field and making monkey noises. 
[02:07:00]  Jesus.  Mm-hmm.  Crazy.  You know, this crazy stuff.  Wow.  And they interviewed a couple of the players.  I'm not too into soccer, so I don't know which players they're going to be on.  But, yeah, it's like they recognize it and they have all these groups against the racism  in soccer, but it's really mainly the European countries that are doing that.  Sounds like they're getting a little crazy.  Yeah.  A lot of people are saying that Anthony would like the racist angle of soccer. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, really?  The racist angle?  No, I'm serious, Johnny.  Thank you.  I want to go to Johnny Queens as well.  He's going to add to what you're saying there in Boston.  Boston Strong, by the way.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  I was thinking about Boston Strong and, you know, Strong in the Storm and all that crap  that we love obsessing about.  Uh-huh.  Those same people in Iraq would not be Boston Strong.  No.  No.  And I'm not talking about our fucking military, who I fully support.  No. 
[02:08:00]  I'm talking about the average person who thinks they're Boston Strong in the middle of Iraq  right now.  I think they'd give.  Ah, did you think they would?  A little bit.  John, what's up?  So, Siobhan is pretty much right, except the fact of the matter is the only people that  are really trying to get rid of the racism and then the monkey chants and stuff like that,  you know, that's all part of the atmosphere that the previous callers said.  Is that the party atmosphere?  Absolutely the party atmosphere.  Jeez.  You do that, if you did that in an NFL game, you'd be kicked out. 
[02:08:30]  You would get a lifetime ban.  Arrested, kicked out, fucking charges against you, civil rights violations.  Yeah.  Yeah, and somehow it's okay for the players to call each other the N-word and get that  15-yard penalty.  That's not going to happen, because only the black players are insane.  But I'll tell you what, part of the atmosphere, I get it, I'm not going to defend it, but I  was at a bar last night in the city, and Michael Shannon was there, and he said, hey, I love  you on the OPN Anthony show. 
[02:09:00]  He said, I love those guys, and totally in his general's odd voice, and he said, they  can talk about anything.  I said, like the boat, and he's like, you're really a listener.  I was like, what the hell?  I mean, why wouldn't I be a listener if I told you that?  I love you on OPN Anthony, but he said, he said, send them my best.  No way.  I kid you not, we completely interrupted him having drinks with his mother, of all people.  She was pissed.  And I said, hey, I'm Owen A fan, love you on the radio.  Nice. 
[02:09:30]  That guy is, that guy's one of my favorite characters on Boardwalk Empire.  He's fucking fantastic.  He's great on our show, too.  Yes.  He was.  In his everyday life, though, he walks around the city with a freaking Sideshow Bob haircut.  I mean, it's all over the place.  That sounds like Sam Roberts.  You never heard that one, did you, Sam?  Sam A.  Sideshow Bob haircut.  That's the first, but yeah.  Good one.  Oh, well then, hello, hello, Michael Shannon. 
[02:10:00]  I love that guy.  Yeah, he really, he said good things about you guys.  Okay.  Oh, I love that one.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Kevin in South Carolina.  Kevin.  Oh, hi, O.P.  Hey.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi, Kevin.  Oh, hi, Kevin.  Did I pull that off?  Well, I tried.  It was pretty good, actually.  That was good.  Hey, that previous caller said going to a soccer game is like a big party atmosphere.  Right.  Don't all the Jimmy Buffett fans say the same thing? 
[02:10:30]  Oh, Parrot Heads.  I gotcha.  Yeah.  It just, you gotta say how good the party is.  It's not good.  I went to a Jimmy Buffett show, and like you're saying, it sucks, but it makes a great party.  You're kind of right.  Yeah.  They know how to have a good time at a Jimmy Buffett concert.  Do they?  And a couple of songs, you're like, all right, I kind of like this one, I guess.  Nah, I'll pass.  I said kind of.  But I mean.  What, are they playing Cheeseburger in Paradise?  Right.  But I mean, the parking lot is just festive. 
[02:11:00]  Colorful hats.  They all try to outdo each other, and they all are mixing drinks in the parking lot.  And during the concert, the beach balls come out, and if you're lucky, you get to hit one.  Oh.  Right?  That's worth 150 bucks.  Right.  So that's like soccer.  All right, I get it now.  I get it a little bit.  That's fantastic.  As children of the 80s, what do you think of reopening of Action Park? 
[02:11:30]  I heard tell of this.  Really?  But from what I heard, they can't do the same attractions, because they were just death.  It was just death waiting to happen.  Is it?  Is it honestly really opening?  The lawsuits.  Wow.  The Alpine Slide alone was just...  You might as well have just thrown your child off a cliff.  Yeah, the Alpine Slide is... 
[02:12:00]  Safety will improve this time around, since the park has upgraded equipment and raised standards.  Standards?  Shmanders?  Give me the goddamn rope swing that people used to get latched onto and thrown into the water.  It's fantastic.  One more call, then we'll go to break.  And I think Dan Soder is going to come in today.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  I like Dan a lot.  Brian in Philly.  What's up, Brian?  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Trying to explain golf, or trying to explain soccer to someone that doesn't get it. 
[02:12:30]  It's like trying to explain golf to someone.  Like, why do you watch golf?  Like, if you don't play golf, you're not going to watch it.  It's kind of the same as soccer.  See, it makes me a hypocrite, obviously, because I love watching golf on TV.  Love it.  And everyone around me, they don't understand it.  They're like, why the fuck are you watching golf on TV?  And you can't really explain it to anyone.  That's a tough one.  When you know the players, and like I said to Pat earlier, I was a caddie for many years,  so I kind of understand a lot of the shots they're trying to make, and this and that. 
[02:13:00]  And I don't know.  And it just goes well with a weekend.  Where you're just laying around and just fucking watching the golf.  It's like made with Hitler shows.  Exactly.  I love those dumb documentaries.  They all end the same way, though.  I would easily watch golf over soccer.  No problem.  Yeah.  That's your explanation.  You know, people that like the World Cups because they understand the game,  understand the ball being moved, and the play's happening.  Yeah, I know.  That's what people have told me.  So, I guess I get that. 
[02:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  It never has interest me.  Never.  So, thank you, Brian.  Punching out.  I think the rest of the world, too.  They don't have a lot of choices as far as sports goes.  That's true.  Soccer's pretty much...  A lot of these countries, do they have as many sports as we do in America?  Fuck no.  And no matter how impoverished the country is, you'll always see some big field with a bunch  of filthy, malnutrition, malnutrished kids, malnutrished kids, filthy kids suffering from 
[02:14:00]  malnutrition, kicking a goddamn soccer ball around.  No.  So, it doesn't even...  What?  No?  Not a soccer ball.  A head?  Whatever.  Whatever.  Everything else that's around except for a soccer ball.  Let's at least give them soccer balls.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Drop some soccer balls on them.  They're kicking a coconut around.  Take a drone, fly it over, and just drop soccer balls.  Let's start there.  But it's something that can be played so easily.  Right.  No equipment is needed except, you know, you make a ball. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  You need a field, two goals.  It really is just nothing is needed.  No uniforms, no padding, helmet things, nothing.  So, I guess it's played everywhere because of that.  I guess.  Baseball, you know.  I know baseball, you can be impoverished and still play, but the fact of the matter is,  you even need a piece of cardboard.  Let me tell you a story.  There was a relief pitcher, a very famous relief pitcher.  Oh, really?  Who?  Didn't have, oh, I won't tell his name yet, and you might be able to guess his name.  He made a mitt out of a piece of cardboard. 
[02:15:00]  Hard to believe.  Wow.  Can you find that clip?  Where he's chastised.  No, no.  The last one.  The last one.  Yeah, no problem.  Hang on.  Can you find that?  Yeah, give me a minute.  Oh, I had it that day.  Should we go to break and you'll find it?  I mean, I can find it during break, or you guys can keep talking.  No, no, we should break anyway.  We'll break.  We'll play it afterwards, because we've referenced it enough where I've got to hear it again.  Yes.  Good old Brandon Stein again, and attempted to tell the Mariano Rivera story. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, you guessed who it was.  For the third time, and Anthony finally gave him the business.  Had it.  Yeah.  Your cardboard mitt.  Dan Soder, next.  Stay there.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony.  I dare you to change the channel.  Please don't.

And I'm Bill Bratton, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department.  MOPD works to assure that people with disabilities can enjoy the rich opportunities our city has  to offer. 
[02:23:30]  This includes the freedom to travel throughout New York City, a right most of us take for  granted.  For people with disabilities, traveling around the city can become a challenge when drivers  fail to follow basic parking rules.  New York City's parking regulations protect the rights of people with disabilities.  When you violate parking regulations, you not only violate the law, you violate the rights  of others.  Parking spaces designated for people with disabilities ensure equal access to goods and services.  Parking without a permit in a designated space or using a fake permit is illegal. 
[02:24:00]  Any car parked illegally in a space designated for a person with disabilities will be ticketed  and subject to tow.  The fine is $180.  So do the right thing and save yourself money and hassle.  Respect the right of every New Yorker to accessible transportation.  Millions of people are suffering from constipation and hemorrhoids.  Are you one of them?  Hello, I'm Dr. Roger Sidaway.  And as a gastroenterologist, I've been telling my patients for years that in order to keep things  moving, you need to eat fiber, drink plenty of water, and exercise. 
[02:24:30]  Now I tell my patients to elevate their knees above their waist with the Squatty Potty  footstool when they go.  Here's why.  Anatomically, humans were designed to squat.  But then we started sitting.  And sitting brought on problems like constipation and hemorrhoids.  So the real problem is how we sit.  That's why I recommend the Squatty Potty.  The Squatty Potty is so simple because it helps you elevate your knees while enjoying the  comfort of your own toilet.  Plus, the Squatty Potty is for everyone, not only those with problems.  I recommend it for the entire family.  In fact, my family uses it.

Boys, how are you?  There's Joe Piscopo.  It's been so many years, sir.  You can get your point across and have a laugh with the boys.  How long have we known each other? 
[02:26:00]  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time.  But sometimes, things can go horribly, horribly wrong.  Without the proper forethought, these dream calls become the stuff of nightmares.  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  What's the...  What's the...  I'm trying to keep it nice with the language.  Yeah, of course.  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises in extreme humiliation on a national level. 
[02:26:30]  And I wanted a plug, too.  It's Scottsdale.  Yes.  Tomorrow night, I'm at the Talking Stick Resort, which is going to be a plan.  Calling the good places for you, Joe.  Joe Piscopo.  And that includes Jersey.  Why the obsession with Jersey?  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic.  Because after the Sandy situation, we all joined together.  It's bad you didn't have a beach holiday.  A room full of silence can only lead to irrecoverable damage.  What happened? 
[02:27:00]  Hello, hello, hello.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  So before you pick up that phone, remember, the next asshole could be you.  Hello, guys.  Hello there.  Come on now.  What?  Where are you?  I got you?  A message from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  What happens?  What happens?  Love, love, love.  Leave your penis alone. 
[02:27:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on.  We've got Dan Soder coming into the studio to join the show.  Hello.  Where's Dan going to be?  How you doing, man?  What's up, Dan?  Where are you?  I think you're over there.  I'm right here.  I'm right here.  Do you understand soccer?  No, but I just love how everybody gets so riled up for the World Cup that I get into 
[02:28:00]  it, and I become a xenophobe.  Do you?  And you just look around, and you're like, I hate those people.  I'm like, yeah, you're probably cheering for Spain on the train, just hating everybody.  Opie's got a good point.  He says the people all of a sudden become fans just because it's kind of cool now to  say that you're into soccer.  Well, that's part of it.  I understand there's people that are definitely starting to really like soccer in America,  but there's also those fake people like, oh, no, man, I love the World Cup. 
[02:28:30]  I love soccer.  They have a Facebook posting about it.  I've lived in Williamsburg for about two years.  I'm going to get an artisan beer and go watch the World Cup football.  I call it football.  Football.  Fuck you.  Yeah.  Don't confuse it with American football.  I bet you would need violence.  You wouldn't need violence to be entertained.  Yuck.  Fuck you.  Fuck you for knitting on the train. 
[02:29:00]  Fuck you for blogging about people's feelings.  It's all tied to the same problem.  Yes, it is.  But we're the pompous assholes, though.  Because it should be called football.  Yeah.  Soccer should be called football.  This is not...  The NFL should not be called football.  Handball was taken.  These are one of those gifts you get when you have the best missiles.  Right.  Yeah.  You're like, yeah, we're going to call it football and no one's going to do dick about it.  We can really blow a lot of shit up.  Because in American football... 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  I mean, when you do use your foot, it's, you know, very rare.  It's very rare.  One to three points, at best.  Yeah.  The kickoffs are who gives a fuck.  Right.  Now they've eliminated the kickoffs in the NFL.  The NFL is just perfect for...  What do you mean they eliminated the...  Well, they put them back to, like, they're kicking off from the 35 now, so almost every  kick is a touchback now.  Yeah.  Every kick in the NFL almost goes out of the end zone.  They don't want anyone running.  But I love American football, because I think it just sums us up as a country perfectly. 
[02:30:00]  No, this is football.  Fuck you.  It's like, we're going to have 10 seconds of pure chaotic violence, and then we're going  to sell you beer, and then 10 more seconds of pure chaotic violence, and we're going  to have you on your computer.  We want you to ignore your family.  We want you to do everything, and then, yeah.  Yeah, and then you could, you know, run around in a giant field, score every fucking 30 hours.  Yeah, it ends in a tie.  Yeah, yeah.  But I do love the World Cup, because I like the whole nation versus nation thing. 
[02:30:30]  Can you be a deserter during a soccer game?  Yeah.  I'm just kind of like, you know what, I'm going to...  I think I can hang out over here, and no one's really going to know for a while.  Defect to another country or something?  Yeah, you'd be like, my dad's half Spanish.  I think I could be a fan of Spain.  Yeah, I could do both.  They're good.  No.  I'm into it.  I kind of like it.  If America's winning, I'm into it.  Once they lose, I'm like, yeah, we don't need this.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  They did that against Indiana.  Well, who's your second team? 
[02:31:00]  You know, in sports, you kind of have that second team when yours is out of it.  I don't think...  I can hang out.  Yeah, you can't have a second team.  Who knows?  Like, you know, because we lived in Boston, I'll take a look at the Patriots a little bit  if my Jets aren't doing that great, or...  But who would you do for the World Cup?  Or, like, the Bills, because I lived in Western New York for a while.  That's what I'm asking.  Do you have a second team?  You've got to go in, like, England or something, because, you know, they're close to us.  We kind of came from them.  Yeah, I would have to go, like, Ireland.  It's like when you leave, like, if you're a fucking, you know, you're a Pittsburgh fan. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  Now you live in New York.  Right.  It's like England and the United States.  That's why I used to live over there.  Yeah, that's my point.  So, yeah.  Everyone kind of has that second team.  Although your second team can't be from the same city as your first team.  That's a weird thing.  I strongly believe that.  I like New Yorkers, though, because they always have that confidence.  They're like, what?  I'm a New Yorker.  I like the Jets and the Giants.  You can't.  I hate those people.  You can't do that.  Thank you.  And then the Jets suck by week six, so all of a sudden everyone's like, no, I'm a Giants fan. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  No, I don't do that.  No, Eli is the best thing ever, bro.  I'm an Islanders fan.  You know, that's rough.  Yeah, could you ever go to the Rangers?  No, I've never rooted for the Rangers.  Do you root against them?  Yes, every time.  I wanted the Kings.  There you go.  I wanted the Kings.  That's good fandom.  That's good hot fandom right there.  I can't remember a time that I actually ever rooted for the Rangers.  I can't think of it.  Damn.  1994.  Yeah.  1994? 
[02:32:30]  If they played Al-Qaeda, I think I would go Al-Qaeda for the Rangers.  They got a guy from Long Island on Al-Qaeda.  He's pretty good.  I can't get forward.  Al-Qaeda for four.  Another Mohammed.  Mohammed passes to Mohammed.  Mohammed shoots him across the blue line.  Mohammed against Mohammed.  Mohammed setting up with Mohammed.  Shot.  Score, Mohammed.  Mohammed Al-Shabaab.  Passes to Mohammed Al-Shabaab.  It's like a shitty horse race. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you think it's tough to pronounce the players' names.  Just get a few Muslims in the NHL.  Forget it.  Al-Shabaab.  Al-Shabaab.  Al-Shabaab.  Al-Shabaab.  Al-Shabaab.  Al-Shabaab.  Forget it.  Yeah, that's got to be...  Al-Hula Akbar.  What a shot.  Anyway, so soccer's going on.  That's good for a lot of people.  Yeah, but I guess...  And with the U.S. winning, you know, you look like a dick if you're not kind of into it.  Oh, you've got to be into it? 
[02:33:30]  I guess...  Who do we play next?  Portugal?  Portugal.  Say, I know that.  The worst kind of soccer fans are the ones that are like, I watch it when it's North  World Cup.  And you're like, oh, that's what no one gives a fuck.  No one gives a fuck.  That's like all those Olympic sports.  Yeah, that's like what I...  No one gives a fuck about any of those sports unless it's the Olympics.  I'm a curling...  I was just going to say that.  Are you going to the curling world championship?  Yeah.  If you guys want, I've got four tickets to the luge prelims. 
[02:34:00]  No, I'm not even talking prelims of the Olympics.  I'm talking right now...  Out of season.  Right now they are luge-ing somewhere.  And no one gives a fuck.  At all.  Not for another four years.  They've got a whole circuit.  Yeah.  I'm an amateur luger.  They didn't stop.  No one's watching.  They go from everyone watching to, all right, now we have to go to Hungary for a tournament.  Just the next guy that's taking the luge down.  He's the only one watching.  He's like the carny of the Olympic world.  Yeah.  What do I do?  I smoke meth instead of luges. 
[02:34:30]  I guess Delta Airlines got in some trouble.  What?  Because of the soccer match, right?  What?  I don't have the story in front of me.  Delta sent a little tweet out with a picture.  And it was a picture of the Statue of Liberty on one side with the number two superimposed over it.  The score, two.  And a picture of a giraffe.  Oh, boy.  And the number one superimposed over it.  Because here it is.  Because that's the score of Ghana.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:35:00]  They apologized.  Of course.  For that picture.  But it's...  And I have no idea why.  Oh, I thought it was just like a giraffe.  It's a beautiful picture.  And it's a beautiful picture of a giraffe out on the plains, though.  If they put a picture of some guy with a ring in his nose stirring a buona in a pot, that might be misconstrued.  They apologize for that?  Yes, yes.  Why?  I have no idea.  Don't you see that in Africa? 
[02:35:30]  I would hope you do.  I would assume you would see a giraffe.  Is that their Statue of Liberty?  Well, what are they saying?  What's the problem?  What is the problem?  First of all, who had a problem?  Yeah.  You know who had a problem.  All the blog nation.  Liberal, white, guilty douchebags.  What did we do?  Did they show a picture of a hippo?  You know, that isn't very sensitive.  Oh, here it is.  We're sorry for our choice of photo in our precious tweet.  Precious? 
[02:36:00]  Shouldn't that say previous?  Yeah.  Whoops.  Best of luck to all teams playing in the...  And then the tweet ends.  Precious.  They put a picture of Precious in it.  Precious up there.  Now that might need an apology.  You're like, Delta's really going in on this one.  They're like, fuck you.  Here's a picture of Precious.  What do you want to do, huh, you cocksuckers?  I like Delta goes Tupac and just goes all the way in.  Just fuck you.  Owns it.  Yeah.  That would be great.  It would be.  I'm a SkyMiles member, and I would only fly Delta if that happened. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  What did that guy say?  Move up a little bit.  What seems to be the problem?  Delta, you're...  No, go...  Down?  The smug one?  Yeah, yeah.  Delta, you are a really special kind of edicy, you know.  The incurable beating chest American kind.  That's South African for disgust.  Oh, sorry, South Africans.  Sorry we can't be as good as you guys.  Oh, well, wow. 
[02:37:00]  I love that South Africa's like, yeah, America.  Look how shit...  How about without Americans' stupid, phony outrage, they'd still be apartheid there, so shut up.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City, you might remember.  This is why...  This fucking...  Everyone's opinion needs to be heard, and it's...  Why would there be a need to apologize?  I still don't get what's offensive about that picture.  I don't know.  What else does it say in that story? 
[02:37:30]  Anything else in there?  It's just the tweets that came in.  Yeah.  E-Cow said, congratulations on being both smug, patronizing, and ignorant.  That's three things.  At the same time.  Why?  A giraffe on the plains.  Well, um, I'm getting, uh, I'm getting a report that there might not be giraffes in Ghana.  In Ghana?  I'm like, that might be the problem.  Wait a minute.  Come on.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Michigan.  Kevin.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hello. 
[02:38:00]  Hi.  How are you today?  Good.  Hey, that, uh, that article that they had in the paper this morning I read, they say there  are no giraffes in Ghana.  Oh, yeah?  Well, that could be a problem.  Yeah.  Well, in that case.  Do we know for sure?  It says right here, the long-necked animals do not live in Ghana.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's even funnier.  Ah, who gives a shit?  Yeah.  It's in Africa.  That's even funny.  It's on the continent.  I love stupid people. 
[02:38:30]  Ah, I love the thought.  We didn't know either.  I would have just assumed there were giraffes there.  I guarantee, I still think there are.  I think there are literally giraffes and lions running in every single country on the dark  continent.  Yeah.  If you're an African nation, I just assume it's giraffes and lions.  Everything looks like Doctari.  It would be like rhinos.  Right.  It would be like saying, congratulations, United States, and posting a bunch of Mounties.  Oh, because, like, it's North America.  It's just the continent. 
[02:39:00]  It's the continent.  It's the continent.  That's it.  But I wouldn't be insulted the whole thing.  I wouldn't care if someone made that mistake.  I would think it was fucking hilarious.  Funny as fuck.  I'd be like, oh, yeah, you're calling us Canadians?  That's good.  Funny as fuck.  I wonder if Ghanese...  If I was Delta, I would just tweet, boy, we're stupid.  That's it.  Not have to apologize.  I bet there's giraffes in Ghana.  I bet there are.  You think one's...  There's no giraffes in Ghana.  Why?  They're connected. 
[02:39:30]  It's Africa.  And there's giraffes in...  Giraffes don't know there's borders.  They could walk right into Ghana and go, see, now I'm in Ghana.  There's giraffes in New York City.  There you go.  Central Park Zoo.  That's the zoo.  This is good logic.  I like the...  A giraffe could walk right into Ghana with nary a problem.  Yeah.  I think...  I don't know if the Central Park Zoo...  That doesn't matter.  Did anyone in Ghana have a problem with this?  The Bronx Zoo.  I bet the Ghana...  I saw some of the fans from Ghana.  They don't have a problem with anything.  Yeah.  They looked... 
[02:40:00]  And I said it before.  Like, you ever see Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom?  Yes.  Call him Ma.  That guy?  Come here, hon!  That's exactly it.  Oh, man.  That's fucking great.  Yes.  I bet they have him as...  Dr. Jones!  That guy was crazy.  I bet you they have him as pets, even.  Yeah, they probably do.  I don't understand why you tweet out a picture of a giraffe.  You do not have them.  Delta, I want you to apologize.  No.  You're on Twitter? 
[02:40:30]  No.  I follow Delta.  A direct message there.  We just...  We don't even fly there.  We don't know what's running around your country.  That's their African hub.  Yeah.  Well, I guess it's like if you take an animal that's indigenous to me,  maybe the way...  Like an armadillo, right?  Yeah.  And you congratulate, like, New York.  Let's say the Yankees wanted some.  And you're like, yay!  And there's an armadillo.  You'd be like, there's no armadillo.  But an armadillo could walk its way right into New York. 
[02:41:00]  But would you care?  Would you want an apology?  I don't give a shit.  It would take forever.  The armadillo would take so long to walk all the way to New York.  It's not like they're in Jersey.  Walking armadillo.  And what if it starts hitchhiking?  Exactly.  What if it's on a zany adventure?  I feel like New Yorkers would demand an apology.  That's the one city that would be like, you don't mess this up.  Ain't no fucking armadillo in New York, you cocksucker.  Right, exactly.  I know it. 
[02:41:30]  Our third generation.  No armadillos.  I never seen one.  Been here my whole fucking life.  You wanted to do more apologies?  Yeah.  There's four more.  Do you know what we're doing on our show?  We're trying to go ten days without an apology.  We don't even go a day.  Good luck.  We don't even go a day.  Oh, without someone apologizing?  Yeah.  For something stupid.  Like, every once in a while, people will tweet you, you know, they probably should apologize  for that one.  Yeah.  There's some that have come out, I guess, maybe. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know.  But in general, these apologies are all just complete bullshit.  It's the point we're trying to make with our cute little radio bitch.  No, but it's so fucking weird that we're just a culture of, like, we say the most vicious  shit online.  Yeah, yeah.  People have more contact than the ability to just say fucked up shit to someone directly  via Twitter.  Yeah.  And yet, on the other side of that is everyone's apologizing, except the people that talk shit  on Twitter.  Except that.  But I don't think it's...  I don't know if it's actually our culture. 
[02:42:30]  It's a small minority of people.  Do you think it's all marketing money?  Like, people just don't want to live with money?  Most of us, I'm sure, don't want an apology, don't need an apology for some of this dumb shit  that some of these companies are doing or saying.  Most of us.  It's some weird, like, small minority that has some kind of power in our country right  now.  I've never wanted an apology because of things people have said on Twitter.  Do you need to see an apology from Delta because of their giraffe picture? 
[02:43:00]  No.  I won't fly with them until they do, Opie.  That's someone who studies the animal culture of Africa.  Well, JetBlue apologizes.  Remember the story about the toddler?  Uh-huh.  Forced to urinate in her seat because of a flight attendant?  Hmm.  Where are you at with flight attendants?  You travel a lot.  I think they're all twats, just so I can start the discussion.  I look at them like...  Not all, but most.  They're like food court workers in the sky. 
[02:43:30]  So I can't...  Like, they used to be waitresses, and now they're like, you know, they're just like...  Yes!  Do you want a soda?  My kids don't love me.  Right.  And you're like, I'm sorry, Pam.  She's like, we got you to Atlanta.  Everyone's alive.  I can go back to hating my life.  They know it's a shitty job.  I got a 24-hour turnaround.  They thought it would be cool because they'd get to see the world, but the fact is they  see the world's airports.  Yeah.  That's it.  You get to see a Marriott outside of Fort Worth every fucking two weeks. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  I remember, I think it was a flight to Vegas, and it just blew my mind.  I'm like, where the flight crew is from New York.  Yeah.  We're flying from New York.  They fly to Vegas, and I'm like, now what?  I actually had a conversation.  I'm like, well, now we fly home.  Yeah.  And they're like, and I will have dinner with my family tonight in New York.  I'm like, that's fucked up.  The greats, when they go on a sky tour, where I'm like, where are you heading after this?  They're like, well, we're going to hub in Denver, then we're going to go to Seattle. 
[02:44:30]  And then it's my son Jacob's birthday, but I'll be in Toronto.  No, I'm talking about the ones that just go back and forth all day.  Oh, the one location.  And then they're actually driving back home to their house, even though they've been in  a couple cities that day.  Yeah, they've been in two different time zones.  It's so fucked up to me.  There's got to be something that fucks with your brain.  Yeah, your DNA.  Yeah.  Just come back all warped.  Yeah, because most of us, if we fly, we're going to be there for a little while. 
[02:45:00]  I need a nap.  I'm not them.  If I'm on an hour flight, I'm like, I've got to sleep that way off.  Right, and I sleep.  Anyway, JetBlue apologizes.  Let's see.  He apologized to a mother who said her child had to urinate in her airplane seat because  the flight attendant would not let her use the restroom while the plane sat on the tarmac  at a New York airport.  It wasn't even moving.  All right.  Here's the...  Our team reached out.  We love reading the actual apology because it's all bullshit.  Our team reached out directly to the customer today to offer an apology for her experience. 
[02:45:30]  The crew made a safety and FAA regulation-based decision.  Oh, blame it on the FAA.  Right.  Smart.  Gotcha.  I think they should attack the toddler.  You're a dirty girl.  Well, if she wants to piss all over herself...  We're sorry you're raising a fucking zoo animal.  Yeah.  Next time, keep old Hummingbird bladder at home and we're going to have any problems. 
[02:46:00]  You want to take to the majestic skies with a bladder the size of a dime?  Well, diaper, look into it.  Well, they gave the family some stuff.  Did they?  Free peanuts?  This is even more insulting than what they just did.  Yeah?  In addition to the apology, JetBlue gave the family a $50 credit toward a future flight.  Woo!  Oh, sorry, little habit I picked up from watching the quiz show. 
[02:46:30]  $50 toward a future flight.  Would your kid piss himself?  It's $50.  $50.  At least the flight won't be long enough for her to piss herself.  $50.  What's that getting you?  It's a bus ticket.  Yeah.  And this is an offer to give $5,000 to her favorite charity.  Oh, a toddler's favorite charity?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  This money will be going to the Catch the Boogeyman Foundation. 
[02:47:00]  Very important charity in this girl's life.  The Santa Fund.  Yeah, she had to.  It was a big decision between that and, of course, the dreaded cooties.  We're trying to cure cooties in our lifetime.  What the fuck?  A statement from the toddler read,  the lady on the fly fly made me make a boom boom in my pants.  Official word coming from the toddler camp. 
[02:47:30]  Holy fuck.  What a fucking...  That's insulting.  Our third apology today.  Oh.  Could be the best.  I probably should have saved this for last, but fuck it.  Bored a patrol?  Because maybe people will get bored in two now,  and then they're going to miss this really good one.  Yeah.  KFC.  Oh, I like this one, too.  KFC paying medical bills for a Mississippi girl who was asked to leave because...  Oh, the poor girl.  It's horrible.  Because her facial injuries scared dying or something. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, man.  She's adorable.  I think she's adorable.  She's a little cut up around her mouth.  Remember?  I hope those scars go away.  Remember...  Poor kid.  I just said only a mere few minutes ago that we're not unreasonable.  Right.  I think maybe KFC should apologize, okay?  For making...  I don't know.  For giving a little girl Phantom of the Opera complex?  I know.  She's got a little eye patch on, and her mouth is a little...  I'd love to see the manager approach.  Excuse me, sir. 
[02:48:30]  Can you take that little monster out of my life?  Yeah.  You'd have to fight.  Yeah.  You're making my daughter leave?  Something tells me it sounded more like,  That child can't stay in here.  She's scaring all the customers.  You brought the devil baby in here.  I am not going to sit here and watch that child.  The man wants your baby to leave?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought one.  Yeah.  Some woman that looks like Jesse Orozco telling you to fucking take your kid out of here.  Fuck that. 
[02:49:00]  Add it.  Let's read.  Let's read a little bit of this.  The KFC, excuse me, says it's investigating allegations that a restaurant employee...  You might be right, Ed.  An employee in Jackson, Mississippi.  Jackson, Mississippi.  Jackson, Mississippi.  Asked a three-year-old to leave because her facial injuries disturbed other patrons.  Oh, man.  As you're eating stupid chicken?  She said the child's face was whack.  Ain't creepy as hell.  KFC giving $30,000 toward the little girl's medical bills. 
[02:49:30]  To a charity of her choosing.  Which is the kill every doggie on earth charity.  The old glass eye fund.  Oh, no.  Does she have a glass eye?  I don't know.  That is so sad.  She's adorable.  She is so cute.  What's wrong with her?  The allegations about KFC was made Thursday on Victoria's Victories.  A Facebook page following Victoria's recovery from a pit bull attack in April. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, my God.  She was bit by a dog?  That's crazy.  I mean...  Poor kid.  You know what?  But KFC, I think you really fucked up on this one.  You really fucked up?  You took a little angel that is attacked by a pit bull.  By a monster.  Yes.  You know, pit bulls are friendly by nature, and I don't appreciate that you say they're all evil.  I have a bad reputation as being vicious, but it's just how you're raised.  It really lies with the owner. 
[02:50:30]  They're one of the most lovable dogs ever.  Shut it!  They get a call, though.  Every time we say that.  Every attack!  They're dialing right now.  Who raised the dog?  You know, they're known to be the most lovable.  I, myself, leave my children alone with our pit bull.  You should say my pit bull with my two-year-old.  They've had that.  With my two-year-old.  Yeah, yeah.  Never had a problem.  The most vicious animals on the face of the earth.  They're the velociraptor of this millennium.  Fucking land alligators. 
[02:51:00]  Land alligators.  Fucking walking around, fucking death rolling on little girls' faces.  What's their bite equivalent to?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Their bite grip's equivalent to, like, fucking...  It's like those things that drive pilings in.  That's right.  That's right.  Their fucking jaws can...  That's a fucking myth-busters fact.  They got more pressure here.  Say the phones.  My pit bull loves babies! 
[02:51:30]  Yes!  The administration posted a photo showing Victoria's smiling shyly in spite of her facial scars  and cartoon-decorated eye patch writing.  Does this look scary to you?  That's so sad.  Last week at KFC in Jackson, Mississippi, this precious face was asked to leave because  her face scared the other diners.  I'd love to see the guy that complained.  Oh, right.  Excuse me, miss.  When I finish off my half-bucket original recipe, I notice that monster of a little girl 
[02:52:00]  is staring at me while I'm trying to eat my potato wedges.  And can you ask her to leave?  Because if a dog bit her face, it means Jesus doesn't love her.  God's forsaken that little girl, and I don't want to be reminded of it as I eat my bowl of  mush.  Yes, I eat my deep-fried mush bowl.  Excuse me.  Hey.  He goes up to the counter.  Hey, boy. 
[02:52:30]  I don't like this girl here.  He's breathing through his teeth.  He goes, excuse me.  Look, boy.  I miss you here.  At first, I just thought it was some of that tasty gravy you put on your taters.  Then I noticed that mama wiped her face, and it didn't wipe off.  You tell me, son.  If I can't trust a little girl to be around a pit bull, I can't trust to eat around her  neither.  It was obviously her fault.  She was enticing the dog. 
[02:53:00]  Much like them charges they pinned on me a few years back with her sweet, kissable face.  What?  Oh, it's just the wrongest thing you could do to this poor kid.  This little girl's an angel.  She really is an angel.  We got the apology.  You know, that's the one apology where you're kind of like, I don't know.  Like I said, if anything merits an apology, this is one.  I do want to acknowledge, because they've hit us up on Twitter. 
[02:53:30]  This is a good one.  At times, it's probably okay to apologize.  No, giraffes in Ghana, I could give a shit.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  You made a little girl leave a place of eating because her face was badly beaten.  I do not understand you.  The Garnies, just blown away by our apologies.  We are the same thing from clitoral removal scars.  I cannot eat if I see a little girl with her clit. 
[02:54:00]  I get very upset.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  It's just awful.  The balls it takes, you're at a lousy KFC.  You've got to make them take on a little girl out that has...  You need your borders, bro.  It's Dico.  Look, I like KFC every once in a while, but I kind of am aware that I'm in a shithole. 
[02:54:30]  That's why I wear fucking basketball shorts.  I fully expect to see some strange things in a KFC, okay?  I don't walk in in a fucking suit coat.  Right.  Hmm.  Excuse me, I made reservations for seven.  Right.  It's for soda.  It's, uh...  Yeah, reservations at KFC.  For soda.  Yes, the soda party is here.  Do you have a table by the window? 
[02:55:00]  You know what?  We'll go to the counter and wait until you get our table ready.  We'll be sitting in the non-scarred children's section.  Do you have an available table there?  Excuse me, do you have anything away from that three-year-old monster?  How am I supposed to lick my fingers?  Basically, you've got people talking to themselves in KFC, but you have a problem with a little  girl that's going through a situation.  I've been in multiple KFCs where fecal matter's been smeared on the walls. 
[02:55:30]  There you go!  Oh, you can't use a bathroom.  No.  Yeah.  Every fucking KFC bathroom looks like an asylum holding cell from the 20s.  It's just fucking bloody shit.  With that said, here's the apology.  They're always wonderful.  As soon as we were notified...  We want to apologize to young Harvey Dent.  We wish her good luck in fighting the Batman. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, I feel so bad.  She's so cute.  As soon as we were notified of this report on Friday, we immediately began an investigation.  Ah, investigation.  As this kind of hurtful and disrespectful action would not be tolerated by KFC.  Pardon me.  Did you have the original recipe chicken, or was it the, uh...  It's just one thing.  Columbo, busting it up?  Yes, an investigation at KFC.  I'm sure it was very thorough.  Hello.  My name is Don Falco. 
[02:56:30]  I'm KFC detective.  I'd like to give you this eye.  You could maybe pop that behind your little cartoon patch.  Regardless of the outcome of our investigation, we have apologized to Victoria's family and are committed to assisting them.  The company is making a $30,000 donation to assist with her medical bills.  The entire KFC family is behind Victoria.  I don't think the entire KFC family...  Not the entire KFC family.  There's one person. 
[02:57:00]  You gotta give that little monster money.  Mm-hmm.  I couldn't get a raise out of this motherfucker.  Turns out I gotta grab my baby, get bit by a punt ball.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  I'm gonna have my baby, get bit by a punt ball, get kicked out of my KFC.  That child walk in, I start yelling, world star, world star!  Her grandmother, Kelly Mullen, said Victoria had just been to a doctor's when they stopped at the restaurant. 
[02:57:30]  She ordered mashed potatoes from Victoria because she thought the hungry child could swallow the soft food without chewing.  Oh, no!  Fucking animals at KFC.  God damn it.  She says she was then approached by an employee.  They just told us, they said, we have to ask you to leave because her face is disrupting our customers.  Oh, my God.  From eating our non-chicken chicken.  Yes.  Wow.  I mean, it's not like she's fucking like Richard from Boardwalk Empire. 
[02:58:00]  Fucking...  If I take my mask off while I eat...  Please don't look at me while I eat.  Jesus.  She doesn't look bad at all.  Not at all.  She looks adorable.  She got fucked up by the pit bull, but she looks like she's going to do well.  Why do you have to stay by the pit bull?  Just say a dog, because we all know that pitties are the most lovable.  Pity.  My pity.  I have my pity.  Stop perpetuating pit bull culture.  Yeah.  You're just letting this be a pit bull culture. 
[02:58:30]  You just don't understand, because the news just reports on the massive amounts of killing  that these dogs do.  Efficiently.  The efficient killing.  They're eating machines.  It's their fucking steam shovel jaw.  The fact that they could just pick an eye out of a child like it's a grape.  They would eat your car if you didn't leave them food. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, my God.  These iron chopping machines.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Her picture's bumming me out, because she's such a little cute...  Anyway, let's see.  She's adorable.  All right.  Disrupting our customers.  Victoria wept all the way home, and now is embarrassed by her appearance.  Something that wasn't the case before.  Victoria was attacked by pit bulls at her grandfather's home.  The dogs broke her nose, both jaws, cheekbones... 
[02:59:30]  Wow.  Jesus.  This is how hard they bite.  All right.  Ready?  The dogs broke her nose, both jaws, cheekbones, and right eye socket.  The right side of her face is paralyzed.  Oh!  And she lost that eye, according to her Facebook site.  Why didn't she just say, Harvey, Charlie M?  Just tell me, Charlie M, you fucking...  You made me pop your eye out of your socket for that prick!  Oh, no.  I said Harvey M.  Oh, God.  Charlie M! 
[03:00:00]  Oh, the poor kid.  She got casinoed.  Yeah.  Oh.  More.  Oh, no.  There's more problems.  Her bottom jaw was reconstructed, but she needs a feeding tube and must grow more bone  in her face before more surgery is possible.  Oh, my God.  Someone asked them to leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Get your good pity.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  I don't feel comfortable with your daughter eating on mashed taters, looking at my daughter. 
[03:00:30]  My daughter got teeth, and I just taught her how to use them.  Please make your little monster leave.  Oh, the poor kid.  We don't serve kindly to one-eyed freaks walking in here.  She got a beautiful blue eye.  Poor kid.  She's going to really be leaning on that eye.  Oh, man.  I hope they can fix her up.  Yeah.  That dog was fucking latched onto her face like a monster. 
[03:01:00]  But it's not the dog's fault.  Do you blame the gun or the person aiming it?  You blame the person aiming it.  You know...  What's her grandfather hiding?  What are we not learning about her grandfathers?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are the living conditions of these dogs?  They're very sensitive.  You know, the dog was only responding to something that it perceived as a threat.  An adorable little girl.  A harmless little cute girl.  It perceived it as a threat. 
[03:01:30]  And by the sixth death shake, I think she knew that it wasn't a threat.  By the time it wrung out all lights in her eyes.  Oh, God.  Here we get one of these guys, though.  You know, Anthony, spend an hour with my pit bull.  You change your ways.  You change your tune.  I'm going to bring one into the studio.  Yeah, you can just fucking chew down and pet it.  You know, it's time to close my mind. 
[03:02:00]  Why don't you spend an afternoon with one?  The way you guys say it makes it sound bad.  But pit bulls are good dogs.  I've never seen a pit bull just being gently walked.  The child made an aggressive move.  It must have done something like scratched its ear.  Or maybe smiled and showed those baby teeth that it would soon knock right out of her head.  Jesus.  You see pit bulls in New York, and it's always on some heavy-duty chain. 
[03:02:30]  It's a six-inch-long chain.  The guy is just in control, but barely.  One distraction and all hell's going to break loose.  It looks like it.  And it just wants to go forward.  The fucking Resident Evil dogs are nicer.  You fucking...  You've got to be kidding me.  Yeah, every guy holding it just looks terrifying.  More terrifying than the dog.  What's your number one dog, though? 
[03:03:00]  Everyone has their number one dog they're scared of.  For me, it's German Shepherds, because I was pretty bad on a paper route.  So to this day, German Shepherds scare me way more than pit bulls.  Rottweilers.  Rottweilers.  Rotties used to be the big, like, go-to death dog.  Yeah, in the killing babies field, pit bulls overtook them.  Yeah, pit bulls just took care of everybody.  Rottweilers are pretty intense.  Rottweilers are the scariest.  Yorkshire Terriers, for me.  They're just horrifying.  Little tiffy toodles my sister had used to hide in the bathtub during thunderstorms. 
[03:03:30]  And just, if you looked at it, we'd go...  I fucking hate those dogs.  Little fucking yappy dog.  You should have filled up the bathtub.  Oh, I did.  I turned the shower and I'd go, fuck you.  That thing would go...  It does that bite fucking thing on your hand.  Man, I'd laugh my ass off.  It's like seven bites in one.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Rapid fire.  We gotta go to rain in Cleveland.  Oh, okay.  Ray, go ahead.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hello.  Quickly, sir.  We're on a good roll here.  I had a...  I date a girl whose mom's boyfriend rescued these two pit bulls.  And this fucking guy had to spend time feeding them tranquilizers to keep them in check.  You gotta medicate the dog.  And one night they actually fought. 
[03:04:30]  And I've never seen such brutality.  You're watching two skinny guys fight over a fucking piece of cheese.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you for saying what needed to be said.  This goes unreported.  This is...  No, no, no.  The rescued pet needs to be loved and taken care of very early on.  I have a dog therapist that you need to take your dog to to really get out of this problem. 
[03:05:00]  People are so...  They're just misunderstood.  Maybe babies should have...  Stop having such squishable faces.  Maybe if these kids weren't walking around with such biteable little faces.  Fucking monsters at KFC.  The child could have eaten something that the dog smelled and took as prey.  Was the dog around any food?  Was the baby around food?  Maybe the baby ate something that's not like the natural prey. 
[03:05:30]  Which is anything.  Which is pretty much anything from a mouse to a Buick.  To a Buick.  Right, right.  Maybe it smelled metal.  And it just wanted to chew through its face.  Maybe the dog was saying hi.  Very aggressive.  It was giving kisses.  Little toothy kisses. 
[03:06:00]  Holy fuck.  Orbital bone crushing kisses.  Bone crushing.  Face paralyzing kisses.  They are monsters.  They're fucking...  That walk the earth.  Hell hell.  Oh, the pit bull owners are going to hate us today.  Oh, do you have to apologize to the pit bull owners?  Oh, we're hoping to have to be so much serious, serious, serious, serious, serious. 
[03:06:30]  Sincerely apologize.  Our ignorance of dogs drove us to a comedy bitch.  I think we got a New York City cop on the line.  All right.  Greg.  Yeah, good morning, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Dude, I just got a quick story.  Back in years ago, we encountered a pit bull in the hallway, and it came at us, and my partner  shot it twice, hit it directly in the head, and I swear, guys, the dog just went, and looked 
[03:07:00]  at us like, what else you got?  You know, just like humans on PCP, and they fucking shook off a gun.  They got natural PSP going through their fucking blocks.  Their fucking head, it's like trying to knock out a bowling ball.  It's fucking...  That head of theirs is prehistoric.  Strip down the flesh off of a pit bull head, and I defy you to tell the difference between  that and a T-Rex.  So, what did you guys end up doing after that? 
[03:07:30]  We actually shot it in the torso, and it went down, but it actually lived.  Jesus.  Wow.  Fuck.  It was crazy.  They don't fucking think.  They don't fucking around, man.  Yeah.  Now walks around the neighborhood showing its scars to the other door.  Yeah, I was shot, motherfucker.  Every pit bull's built like Rambo.  They all are fucking...  No, you don't understand.  That baby drew first blood.  It ain't my fault.  It's their fault. 
[03:08:00]  They're all dead.  All the other pit bulls are dead.  What you've just unleashed in your backyard is a killing machine.  I didn't start this.  They started it.  They're all gone, Bobo.  That's his name and other pit bulls.  You send those babies in.  You better order one thing.  I'll large supply of diapers and eye patches.  Have a great day, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Bullet to the head, and it bounced the fuck off. 
[03:08:30]  I said, what else you got?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Can you imagine that?  That would be scary.  You just look at your partner like, what the fuck?  Fuck.  Why?  Yeah.  Fuck.  That's crazy.  People want to know if it was a regular KFC or one of those KFC Taco Bell combo.  Oh, a taco hut?  That's the big difference there.  KFC wasn't going to say anything, but the Taco Bell got involved.  Yeah.  I love those combo places. 
[03:09:00]  It's a little confusing, though.  I don't know.  You don't know what you should get.  I know.  You're confused.  You never get some of one and some of the other, though, do you?  As a pothead, I think it's the greatest thing ever.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  A personal pan pizza and a burrito and throw in some fucking chicken tenders.  You go for the...  You know what?  It's the greatest.  You got a good turn to the air.  Yeah.  It is amazing.  All right.  Well, fuck this.  KFC.  KFC sucks.  A very... 
[03:09:30]  A big one.  A legitimate apology.  Right.  That's a real...  Yeah, I can't fucking...  A whole bunch of slobs in KFC looking at her as the problem.  Sweet girl.  Can you make that girl leave?  Yes!  Why?  I'm uncomfortable.  Help grotesque people.  Sir, excuse me.  You have gravy in between two of your fat rolls.  Thank you.  I was saving that.  Make that little girl leave. 
[03:10:00]  Aw.  Poor kid.  We have two more apologies.  Oh, okay.  But we can wait for after the break.  There's a big one.  Is that...  We want that one to sit there for a while.  That's...  Let's just digest that one for a while.  Yeah.  There's no way...  KFC, you know, we're not monsters on this show.  They should have apologized on that one.  Yes.  But not everything...  But see, the problem is with everyone apologizing.  When there's one that is legit, it just seems like nonsense.  It gets swept under it.  You forget about it.  That's why you've got to stop with the silly apology.  So when someone does apology, you can go, oh, wow, okay. 
[03:10:30]  No one apologized to the dog for just being a dog.  It's just doing what it knows.  I think you guys should apologize to pit bulls, pit bull owners, and KFC, people who take their pit bulls to KFC.  It was just projecting itself from the soft, velvety, smooth cheeks of a child.  Maybe the toddler said the trigger word of doggy.  That's a trigger word. 
[03:11:00]  A trigger word.  A trigger word.  I think as far as innocence goes, there's nothing more innocent than a blonde, blue-eyed, perfect little Aryan baby.  Did nothing wrong to deserve this.  Maybe a kitten is more innocent than her.  That's about it.  There's nothing more adorable than that little girl.  That's it.  Yeah.  It starts with her.  Yeah.  All right.  Dan, what are you promoting?  Anything?  I'm at comics at Foxwoods end of July.  Oh, that's down the road. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, it's a while.  But that's all good.  Yeah.  We'll continue with Dan.  Stay there.  No freaks.  The Opie and Anthony show will be right back on SiriusXM.

Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show, the guys learn old habits die hard.  Jimmy, you okay, man? You feel all right?  Yeah!  You seem sick or something. 
[03:20:30]  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  When Jimmy shows up late, questions arise.  You all right? You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one fucking time.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  You might be sensitive here.  What? Yeah, I don't fucking...  What the fuck do I care?  Have you been drinking?  Who fucking cares? What?  Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Listen as friends and listeners come together to solve a problem.  Well, Mongo the Trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock. 
[03:21:00]  Fuck Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show?  Or now it's the Opie and Anthony and Mongo show?  Get fucked, Mongo.  But at least he still thinks Gary sucks.  I think we've proven we care.  Ha! Yeah!  Fucking!  Where's Gary?  Fuck him!  Laugh, love, and learn.  You're not going to drink today, right?  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man.  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do.  Fair enough.  Next week, on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Fuck you, I'm fine. 
[03:21:30]  You'll be having the show's back on Sirius XM.  Ah, yes.  Dance order in the house.  Oh, my God.  Killing it today.  We're laughing our asses off here.  The whole KFC story, we didn't even play the news story. 
[03:22:00]  I want to see how they handled this on the news.  Still got legs.  Watch a local anchor fake sympathy.  Yes, I love these.  There's the actual news story from the girl about the girl that got bitten by the pit bulls,  went to KFC, and they threw her out because they said she was scaring the customers.  And she really, she got beat up pretty good, but she doesn't look bad at all. 
[03:22:30]  Unbelievable.  Let's see how the news handled this.  This is one of those stories where the news should, you know, step out of character and go,  holy shit.  Holy shit.  You're not going to believe what KFC did on this one.  Coming up next.  Something is a little...  Something's amiss.  I can't refer...  I was trying to think what fucking dumb food pun they would use.  Oh, yeah.  That would probably be a food pun.  This story not finger licking. 
[03:23:00]  I'll get it started, at least.  Poor little girl.  KFC just served up a bucket of lack of sympathy.  In Jackson.  A certain little girl will be going back to KFC.  Maybe their original recipe should be manners.  Oh, really?  KFC feeling a bit extra crispy today.  The heat.  The heat's turned on. 
[03:23:30]  Fucking dumb local news puns.  I love...  I say it all the time on the show.  I love watching the local news, because it's so ridiculous.  In college, I was a journalism major, and I had to take a class with the local...  He was the weekend weatherman.  Oh, nice.  He walked around like he had the biggest dick.  He was the guy.  He's like, listen, now, at KGUN, when we get a story, what we do is...  Why would we get KGUN 9?  And what we do is...  He was such a fucking tool.  He was such a tool. 
[03:24:00]  And I would always ask him, like, mean questions, because I knew that he felt like a failure.  Yeah.  And he'd be like, hey, do you feel like there's a low-pressure system moving in right now?  And he'd be like, all right, first off, that's not an apple-pissed question.  I am a meteorologist.  A weekend meteorologist.  Yeah, they hate being called weatherman when they're meteorologists.  Hey, weatherman!  I'm a meteorologist.  They're weathermen.  Yeah, hey, sky whore.  If you get the weather on your phone within seconds, your job isn't that special. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, they're fucked now.  Done.  Exactly.  Let's see how they handled the story, the KFC story, and the pit bull and the little girl.  Buffering.  There we go.  America's Newsroom.  Oh, it's Fox Hammer.  They leave one of its restaurants because of the way she looks.  Three-year-old Victoria Wiltshire recovering from a vicious pit bull attack.  A little girl's grandmother recently took her to KFC in Jackson, Mississippi, but their meal ended early when an employee asked the family to get up and leave. 
[03:25:00]  I sit down at the table with her, and the lady came over, and she said that we'd have to leave.  We were disturbing her other customers, but Victoria's face was disturbing other customers.  What's yelling in the background?  Is it another dog?  My baby was slurping up her potatoes, and they said it was bothering everybody.  So I says, you're black.  You can't talk to me. 
[03:25:30]  I could have you shot for that.  Is your brother around?  I find him hunky.  I love how we assume that it has to be black.  Well, yeah, it's Mississippi.  There's black stuff and there's white stuff.  We all know it.  My little baby, my angel, had her face all mished up.  She was drinking out the white water fountain, so I don't see what the problem was. 
[03:26:00]  But there's dogs barking.  There's dogs barking.  There should not be a dog within 100 miles of this poor kid.  Turns out, our fighting dogs don't like our granddaughters as much as wheeze do.  Wheeze.  Wheeze.  Wheeze.  Wheeze love our kin, but our doggies don't.  Wheeze do.  Oh, my God.  I thought this was going to be local news.  There's probably a local story somewhere, but let's see how we get it. 
[03:26:30]  Bill Hemmer.  Yeah.  Them rallying behind Victoria.  Rallying?  After having posted their outrage on Facebook, KFC now apologizing.  That fast food chain releasing a statement, quote, as soon as we learned the report on Friday,  we immediately began an investigation regardless of the outcome.  I just popped out of the kitchen.  What happened?  Colonel.  The company also giving $30,000 toward Victoria's medical bill.  Oh, wow.  We hope she recovers soon.  Our best to win.  Get well.  Get well. 
[03:27:00]  Is Obama to blame?  Is this President Obama's fault?  Another scandal under the Obama administration.  First to trade, now this.  This Fox News alert.  Fox News has learned that more toddlers have been attacked by pit bulls under Obama's watch  than any president in history.  And if it wasn't for Obama, her eye would have been saved.  Wheeze was just going to pop it back in. 
[03:27:30]  Well, the same thing happened to her older sister.  But she was fine.  Fine.  That's just.  Imagine getting that call, though, at corporate.  Yeah.  You're the KFC guys.  Hey, guys, hold on.  I'm going to be right out in the hallway to join you from sushi.  I got someone from the Mississippi office calling.  Hold on.  Cooter, slow down.  What are you saying?  You got.  You did.  You did what?  Help. 
[03:28:00]  She's three.  You know.  What was.  She was bit in the face by a dog.  Guys, I'm not going to be able to meet you for lunch.  I got to draft up an apology.  I got to deal with a shitstorm.  That was one of our employees.  I.  Yeah.  Okay.  Just wanted to clear that up.  Yeah.  You sure wasn't a customer.  Yeah.  I wasn't trying to find any angle out of it.  Who recommended that we take this course in action?  Okay.  Is. 
[03:28:30]  Do you know if there's any way we can pay her hush money?  Yes.  Have the lawyers draft a statement.  Make sure we say this is not the way KFC handles this problem.  See if her grandmother will receive more dogs as a payment to keep it a noisy garage behind  her while they interview her.  Right.  You know, one of those dogs is the one that bit the girl.  He's like, I want to interview.  You know they didn't get rid of the pit bull.  She couldn't have been.  We can't just put it down.  Well, it's valuable property. 
[03:29:00]  I could sell it.  Right.  For two cartons of smoke.  Maybe we could take it to the pawn shop.  That dog is a legend here in Jackson, Mississippi.  That's the rain dog.  He tells if the rain's going to come.  He's our weekend weather dog.  Oh, shit.  All right.  All right.  Well, that's...  That fucking...  You want to...  We got two more apologies for today. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Five total today.  Five apologies.  I think we had some yesterday.  We just blew it off.  Phew.  At this point, we could do half our show on apologies.  Fox 17 in Nashville.  This is a great one.  All right.  They have to apologize for Wiz Khalifa.  Is that how you say his name?  Wiz Khalifa?  What happened there?  He was at Bonnaroo.  Fox...  This is their apology.  It's great.  Fox 17 would like to apologize for the Sunday evening live segment from Bonnaroo. 
[03:30:00]  Uh-oh.  During the broadcast of our live report, Wiz Khalifa, one of the artists performing, used some  profane language.  And they always have to have this, which does not represent our views and standards.  I always thought it did.  Yeah.  I mean, watch the news.  I thought it...  Motherfucker did represent your views and standards.  Yeah.  Oh, motherfucking storm rolling in tonight.  Why don't you tell us about it, asshole?  Well, thanks a lot, dickface.  That's right.  Coming up, we got some fucking sports.  Yeah.  I thought it did represent... 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Well, thanks for clearing that up.  Uh, we were unaware of the performance content beforehand and apologized to anyone offended.  Unaware of the performance content?  Is there a video of that?  Of Nashville apologizing for Wiz?  I would hope so.  Guy...  How great is that?  We apologize.  I like that someone confused it with their regular program.  Yeah, exactly.  They're taking a much darker approach to local news.  Yeah, but why can't you just figure shit out on your own where you're sitting at home  going, oh, wow, wow, they fucked up. 
[03:31:00]  That used to be the best, when people would fuck up on TV and you'd call your friends.  Like, were you watching this?  They fucked up.  And you had to be watching it.  Yeah, you had to be watching it.  Or you got to explain it to someone.  But for them to actually say, it does not represent our views and standards, that's so stupid.  Who doesn't know that?  We are about smoking shit tons of weed, but not using the language he uses.  And if you can marry a booty girl, then do it.  Wow, he got... 
[03:31:30]  He was in the background, I guess?  I would assume, right?  We're here at Bonnaroo.  We're here at Bonnaroo.  We're here at Bonnaroo.  We're here at Bonnaroo.  What a great time everybody's having.  Yeah, my nigga.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Did you hit the dump button?  Did you hit that delay button?  We'd like to apologize.  I hope it was like a...  That'd be funny if it wasn't in the background, if he was giving an interview, and then just  sounded off.  And just said it.  These motherfuckers up here in Tennessee.  Yeah.  I would assume it was just in the background. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, all right.  The music was playing, I don't know.  Language does not represent our views and standards.  It does represent us.  Yeah.  That's exactly how we feel.  Now to the assassinations going on in Iraq, which will bring you in HD.  We're going to show you them getting the back of their head shut off.  Yes.  No.  All right.  No.  What's the next apology then?  You know, it's TLC apologizing for airing an expletive-laden Honey Boo Boo episode in 
[03:32:30]  the UK.  What?  Expletive-laden?  Laden.  In the UK?  They don't care about curses over there.  And the TLC has apologized for breaching UK rules designed to protect kids from offensive  language.  Oh, my word.  Episode of, uh...  That fat little girl saying dirty things.  What did that chubby girl just say on the telly?  That little monster's crazy.  Wow, this sounds pretty high-tech.  A complaint alerted Ofcom to offensive language in the program when their six-year-old child 
[03:33:00]  was watching.  The agency sent in a report.  Uh, it noted five instances of the word fuck or fucking during the episode.  Eleven scenes where someone said shit, and one scene in which someone used the word  bitch.  They bleeped that out, though, right?  You just could kind of...  They didn't bleep it out enough for England?  Or it just flew?  The show aired at eight ahead of what is known as the 9 p.m. watershed in Britain.  Yeah, the watershed. 
[03:33:30]  After which easier material can air.  Oh, yes, like Monty Python.  The most of...  Oh, I wish...  Here, you've got to do this in a British accent.  Oh, my word.  Let's see what we have here.  Yes, yes.  The most offensive language must not be broadcast before the watershed.  According to British rules, offensive language must not be broadcast before the watershed.  They said it twice. 
[03:34:00]  The watershed.  Unless it is justified by the context.  In any event, frequent use of such language must be avoided before the watershed.  They love watershed.  They love that watershed.  The watershed.  Watershed.  Nah.  After the watershed, you can say anything.  Anything you want.  The Queen's a fucking cunt.  Oh, a bloody cunt.  It's after the watershed.  Oh, the watershed.  Lady Di was a whore.  She just deserved it. 
[03:34:30]  Watershed.  Watershed.  Those fucking...  At least they were honest.  Prince William is a poof-ter.  Post-watershed.  Post-watershed.  Watershed.  Pre-watershed, I would never, never, post-watershed ever.  I'll say what most won't say.  That little girl deserved to be kicked out.  Watershed.  Watershed. 
[03:35:00]  Watershed.  Watershed.  This is why there's fucking...  Well, you missed one.  What?  You missed one.  The apology from, I think it was ESPN, about the...  Which one?  The mayor of...  I don't know if they've apologized.  The L.A. mayor?  I was going to move on to mayors.  Oh, because I heard the L.A. guy say it, and then they apologized when they came back.  Oh, they did?  Earlier on the broadcast, you might have heard.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What did he say?  This is a big fucking day?  Yeah, he goes, he goes, you know, there's a couple of things you don't do as a politician, 
[03:35:30]  and one is something, and then he said, and the other is cursed.  He goes, but this is a big fucking day.  Oh, really?  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, so he ignores...  Oh, kings.  Yeah.  Tonight on Jimmy Kimmel, I'll look forward to hearing my colleague, Mayor de Blasio, sing  I Love L.A.  He looks stoned.  Right.  And you should all be very happy I'm not singing tonight.  But there's two rules in politics.  They say never, ever be pictured with a drink in your hand, and never swear.  But this is a big fucking day.  Way to go, guys. 
[03:36:00]  Wow.  Good for him.  Oh, man.  He's the cool teacher.  That's awesome.  He's the cool teacher that sometimes helps class outside.  What do you mean we're watching a movie?  It's only Thursday.  Cool.  That is awesome.  He's saying, hey, man, as being the mayor of L.A., it's pretty far out.  Pretty fucking deal.  Pretty fucking big day.  Pretty fucking big day.  And do they have the apology on this one, too?  I don't know.  I'll check.  See how long it is left.  It looks apology. 
[03:36:30]  But this is NHL Network.  Uh-huh.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I know they're continuing.  Maybe.  Let's see.  Maybe.  Maybe.  No.  No.  I guess so.  It's like a roast.  Yeah, they came back and said, oh, thanks for playing.  They just can't even leave that moment.  Like, wow, that was kind of cool and, you know, unexpected.  And I really don't think anybody listening suffered any physical damage.  I don't think a little girl now has to wear an eye patch and get kicked out of fast food 
[03:37:00]  restaurants because somebody heard the word fuck.  Because, yeah, because he said it's a big fucking day.  My mic just went.  Did it?  Yeah.  Something just.  You hear that, right?  It got a little lower, right?  Yeah.  Did it?  Okay.  I'm just turning my headphones up.  I don't care.  Why not?  I already hear fucking.  Something just went in this mic.  Cathedral bells in my ears when I'm trying to sleep at night.  It's wonderful.  Hissing.  It's not bad, but something just went in this mic.  Aw.  Whatever.  All right.  And so do we have de Blasio on?  All right. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, wait.  Yeah.  And your pad is falling off?  You're losing your pad.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  Maybe that's what it is.  Oh, God.  Your pad fell off.  My pad fell out.  Oh, how embarrassing.  My pad fell out.  Oh, no.  You should be so.  You're blushing.  You're bad.  Does anyone have an extra?  So what did the L.A. mayor say?  Sorry for being so sorry?  No, he didn't apologize at all.  Good.  No, he acknowledged that he was going to. 
[03:38:00]  He said.  It was being broadcast.  Yeah.  He acknowledged he was going to curse.  Fuck it.  No, it was ESPN, I guess, like I said.  I didn't see the apology.  No.  I just imagine someone at ESPN that was running the control boards, like, just let it go.  Oh, it's a hockey celebration.  Yeah, chill out, man.  The apology was voiced over a view of the mayor.  Oh, okay.  So if he's sitting there and they show him kind of just staring into the camera a little  with a hand, is that it?  Yep.  You got it?  Good. 
[03:38:30]  On behalf of Fox Sports West, we would like to apologize for the inappropriate language  you heard earlier, back inside, to the rep.  It's a guy's network, right?  I like that they patched someone in.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, please.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Do I have a signal?  We would like to apologize.  Please point out the person that's watching ESPN and was offended by that. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  Fox Sports.  Please.  Fox Sports.  Fox Sports, sorry.  Fox Sports West.  Please point out that person.  Here at Fox Sports West, we don't like the use of party language.  Someone said an inappropriate language.  And if you were offended by it, you're a cunt.  I saw the de Blasio thing on the camera.  Is it bad?  It's horrible.  Those dumb bets are horrible.  Pretty wacky bet, though.  Nice.  Those guys are saying, you know.  Those guys aren't all business.  No.  They're fun.  They're a lot of fun. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  Hello, Billy.  Mr. Williams on Friday in the LA.  You got to remember, we didn't win at lawn bowling.  We won in hockey.  So, kids out there, do not say what your mayor said today.  Yeah, that's right.  By the way, these guys are telling me, they told us not to curse, and then the mayor came  out and cursed.  If I could vote, you'd have my vote.  All right.  Canadian curses.  We're going to go live now.  That's the home of, actually, the Duran.  Comes from Canada.  Fill on everybody in.  Let's go to him right now. 
[03:40:00]  I believe he is at the ABC Studios in New York.  I love him.  Oh, look at him all.  He looks like a real Times Square dad.  Oh, yes.  But not like this, man.  Oh, man.  He's a real hippie.  Well, thank you, first of all, for making good on your bet.  You're a strong man for doing that.  Well, Jimmy, we New Yorkers honor our bets, but I don't have that great a singing voice.  So I've got some friends here to help me out.  These are the kids from the 52nd Street Project here in Manhattan.  52nd Street Precinct. 
[03:40:30]  Everything has to be a promotion.  Here we go.  Go down the window.  Put back the top.  Put back the top.  Is there one white kid in that group?  From the South Bay to the ballet.  From the West Side to the East Side.  Everybody's very happy. 
[03:41:00]  Because the sun is shining.  Well, this kid was like 19.  Yeah.  Another perfect day.  I love L.A.  Whoa.  Yeah.  I love L.A.  Mr. Mayor, do I got to sing about that L.A. song?  Yeah, nicely done.  Wait for it.  He's got something else.  Thank you.  You look like a counselor at the worst camp ever. 
[03:41:30]  Kids over laughing.  Brack out.  We have one more payoff to make, I believe.  Is that correct?  And, Jimmy, the lucky winners are in your studio audience.  We have sent the finest hot dogs from New York City.  Oh.  Grazed papaya.  You think they travel well?  Oh, yeah.  Nothing travels like a nice hot dog.  Oh, yeah.  We've just given everyone in your audience diarrhea. 
[03:42:00]  We'll see you next season.  I'm going to stick with Pinks.  They make those grazed papaya dogs.  Fuck you, you smoke cunt.  I'm right.  They kind of make a grazed papaya dog taste like a steaming bag of New York garbage.  This is crazy.  You're a great man, Bill, and a great mayor.  Love you, man.  Thanks so much.  Love you, man.  You know who he is?  He's one of those villains from an 80s movie.  Where he's like, yeah, I don't know, maybe my dad owns the ski lodge. 
[03:42:30]  Maybe you should get lost, de Blasio.  No one wants you at this summer camp.  Why don't we have a ski competition to see who's best?  Guess what?  This summer at the Cherokee Games, I'm going to win everything.  He is.  You piece of New York garbage.  I don't know.  I say the F word.  I don't really care.  I don't wear underwear.  I don't care.  I go bareback.  I kind of like him.  Of course you do.  I like him.  I think relationships should be open. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  What did de Blasio say?  Did he have a comeback to that swarmyness?  He got bitch slapped.  He did get bitch slapped.  So how do you handle it?  Hot dogs taste like garbage.  How do you handle it?  That's a New York beaming garbage.  How do you handle it?  I'm going to fucking kill you.  I'm going to fucking kill you.  That's what he should have said.  I'm going to fucking kill you.  Hey, what the fuck?  Hey, stop clapping.  What the fuck did you just say?  Well, I had sex with your wife. 
[03:43:30]  His wife's in a coma.  At the bonfire tonight.  Me and you.  I'm going to show you what's going on in this All-Valley Under-18 Karate Tournament.  Sweet the leg.  De Blasio.  What a smug.  I eat pink hot dogs.  I love them.  Yeah, I got pinks.  I love them.  Make that papaya look like it blondes up your asshole.  You dirty fucking attack. 
[03:44:00]  Why did you suck that like a cock?  This was a friendly wage.  I wore a shirt that says I love L.A.  I don't love L.A.  I love New York.  Yeah.  That's how you know, just the victim of a bully when they go like, yeah, your hot dog tastes  like garbage.  I love you, dude.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know how passive-aggressive is that at all.  I love you.  That's such a popular kid in high school move.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, look at this faggot.  Nah, but I love you.  I love you. 
[03:44:30]  Okay, okay.  I'm going to do my whole thing.  All right, he's not punching me, so I'll just smile.  I'm going to do my homework, de Blasio.  Hey, de Blasio, where's my geometry homework?  I get it done.  I get it done, babe.  I get it done.  De Blasio, I thought I told you never to come in here again.  You keep this up.  I'm not inviting you to my parents' summer home.  He's a good guy.  You just don't know.  You just don't know.  Oh, guys, he treats me different around.  But when we're not around the other mayors, he's super nice.  He's super nice. 
[03:45:00]  He jokes.  He jokes.  He's joking.  He doesn't mean it.  He got my kid a pit bull.  Stupid mayor bets.  Who cares?  We're going to give you a sack of oranges.  Right.  If you give us.  Well, there was a governor bet, too.  But I guess that wasn't a big deal.  Oh, right, yeah.  Cuomo said he was going to send some, like, Manhattan clam chowder or something.  The gift basket.  The gift basket.  All the nice things that are from New York.  In California, it was a book about the history of California and rice cakes. 
[03:45:30]  What a...  That's like a terrible relative birthday gift.  It's terrible.  Oh, thanks, Aunt Patty.  Look, a book about California.  That's good.  Can we move on to something?  Yeah.  The situation's back on TV.  Is he now?  I've been waiting for this.  He's back on TV.  I'm a fan of his written work.  And it goes with one of our bits.  Siblings of famous people.  How they look like the famous person if that person was retarded. 
[03:46:00]  Just a little off, yeah.  Swayze was one of the best.  One of our classic bits.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, most...  Swayze was the best.  Swayze's brother looked like Patrick Swayze with just a little twist.  The twist of the DNA.  Frank Stallone's kind of like that, too.  Yeah, Frank Stallone's another one, you know.  Tom Hanks has a brother.  Tom Hanks has a brother.  Have you ever seen Tom Hanks' brother?  No.  What's his name, though?  I don't know.  Mitch Hanks?  Look at Swayze's brother. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, no.  Like, Swayze was a sex symbol.  And then Swayze's brother looks like you put Patrick Swayze's head and squished it a little.  The DNA's a little off.  We need a guy that looks like he can run through a window, but also look like Patrick Swayze.  If Patrick Swayze was a comic strip and you put Silly Putty on it, and then you just pulled it a little.  Go with Tom Hanks' brother, too.  Tom Hanks?  Yeah, that's another one.  I believe that was another one we used to really beat the shit out of.  It's a little off. 
[03:47:00]  It's all the same features.  They just got all fucked up.  Yeah, they're all twisted around a little.  It's like he permanently stayed in the Philadelphia role.  What the fuck is it, Jim?  It's not Tom Hanks.  I think I saw Tom Hanks at Buffon's today.  You look sick.  You look sick.  And you're a Hanks by birth.  Tom, are you well?  No, I'm his brother.  Shut up.  It's Mitch Hanks.  Are you doing that hair thing for a role? 
[03:47:30]  No, I'm bald.  Tom got the hair.  No, I didn't.  He has the means to take care of the hair problem in the Hanks family.  Oh, God.  Where's your brother?  What happened?  They also all have the names like the brother, like Jim Hanks.  Yeah.  Like that would be Tom Hanks.  Is that his name?  Jim Hanks.  I loved you in Forrest Gump.  I wasn't in Forrest Gump.  I worked down at the CVS.  What does he do?  Is he a doctor or something?  I think he works at CVS. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, he's an actor.  Oh, no.  He's not.  What a guy.  Oh, Jenny, you needy fuck.  Oh, it's Jenny Hutt.  What are you?  What?  We're doing a radio show.  Hi, Jenny.  How's your knee?  Did you hurt yourself?  Oh, Christ.  She's so needy.  Jenny, did you hurt your knee?  Was it your knee?  I couldn't tell where you were bruised.  Let me see.  Why are you waving at us?  Let me see.  I'm like the religious too.  It's gross.  Let me see.  Yeah.  I am Brian.  I know.  Nice to meet you. 
[03:48:30]  I know her brother very well.  Oh, of course.  From what?  The big BK.  I did his podcast yesterday.  A lot of...  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can't hear.  Some extra cleavage today, I see you.  She is looking so fucking sexy.  Look at the extra cleavage.  That's my friend's sister.  You leave her alone.  I know.  I can't help it.  Guys.  All right.  Bye.  She falls way out of my demo.  You got it.  But there's something so fuckable about Jenny Hutt.  She is a nice woman.  I know.  She is a very nice lady.  She was hanging with Jason Biggs.  Oh, no.  Of course.  There was a desperation tweet I really wanted to share. 
[03:49:00]  She is so desperate to be liked.  She'll retweet anyone.  She'll...  What is it?  Add their names on her tweets.  What is it?  That's Jenny Mullen.  It's Jason Biggs' wife.  Uh-huh.  Who's a big it girl right now.  Sure.  She just came out with a book.  And she was saying, could have talked to Jenny and Jason for hours.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  If they didn't run away from me.  Could have talked to Jenny for hours while Jason watched.  Buy her book.  P.S.  Jenny, follow me back on the Twitter.  Oh. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, a big for a follow.  A big for a follow back.  That's always good.  Oh, yeah.  Follow me back.  Did she write back to her?  No.  Christ not.  Oh, she's a nice lady.  Jason Biggs.  Maybe Jenny doesn't want to be called a lady, but she's a nice lady.  You know what?  Why don't we take a break, then we can get into the situation's new show.  I'm excited.  Invited her to my party.  Jenny, huh?  Yeah.  Everybody here is invited to my party. 
[03:50:00]  Thank you.  Oh, look at him.  I told you.  What?  Oh, no.  Who's the guy all the way to the right?  They're brothers.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, bro, what?  It's 100% like...  What we were talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I saw those people walking into a comedy show, that group...  Oh, you just know there's going to be a problem.  They sit right up front.  This is going to be fucking funny.  You know, don't be too mean to my bro, but get him. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Can you get him?  You know what's fucking funny with this fucking asshole comedian don't know?  We're just as funny as he is.  We're going to help the show.  And if he tries even saying a fucking word, watch how we come back at him.  Dude, bro, he says anything to my girl?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to fucking roast him.  So where are you guys from?  How about you go fuck yourself?  We're from your mother's...  I'm mad articulate. 
[03:51:00]  How about we're from a little place called...  None of you fucking bitches.  He's a comedian to me.  He's a comedian to me.  You got to buy two drinks.  Now you got to buy them.  Hey, Gene, enough with the vodka.  You're fucking stumbling.  You're making a fucking scene.  Don't make a fucking scene.  Maybe I should be the one on stage.  I'm kidding.  Go ahead.  Hey, last time...  Go back to what you were saying.  What was the thing you were saying about...  And then you're like, you know, I live in Queens. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, Queens!  Oh, that's where my fire...  Yeah, Queens!  Fucking...  You must have read the review for the show,  because this is the exact angle we were going to take.  It's just the over-the-top Italian thing.  A new reality, sober situation, and kin star in the Sorrentino's.  Sorrentino's, right.  Hey, the Sorrentino's!  You thought the Jersey Shore was crazy.  Wow. 
[03:52:00]  This, to me, is like if a black person turns the TV on and sees...  Lordy, Lord!  Where the chickeny, woody melon?  Like, watching these jadroos.  These jadroos.  You're offended?  I'm offended.  Yes.  Do you need an apology?  I need an apology...  From the Sorrentino's.  ...to all Italian-Americans.  Well, I mean, you know, they wrote a...  The review makes me want to watch, I'll tell you right now. 
[03:52:30]  Yes.  First, it starts with,  There's another situation going on in Jersey this summer!  The guy that wrote that was probably just stroking his dick on the outside of his pants.  He's like, you know what I'm going to open the article with?  There's a situation...  Well, I'm so glad I went to Northwestern.  Fuck yeah!  ...from a prestigious journalism school.  I'm a journalist.  There's another situation going down in Jersey this summer.  A family situation! 
[03:53:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Set you DVRs!  Yeah, come on!  There we go.  Spaghetti Weekly's called it.  A masterpiece.  Linguini Digest said.  It just might beat my mother's gravy.  Yeah, TV like your mother used to make.  Oh, fuck.  Jersey Shore alum,  The situation is back on reality TV,  and this time,  blood really is thicker than water! 
[03:53:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh!  But it ain't thicker than our mother's saw!  Hey!  I gotta go go go go go go go go!  Did you read this?  No.  Oh, no.  It's just a fucking...  Oh, no.  Don't be like this.  They're talking about the mother's saws.  Oh, no.  That's why you're doing this.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Thicker than water!  Because he's rolling with some familiar co-stars.  His mom...  Oh, Mom, you're embarrassing me!  Come on, Ma!  His two older brothers, Frank and Mark, 
[03:54:00]  and a secret Melissa!  They didn't get a break like I did,  so I'm gonna help out my family!  I'm gonna trail them along.  Every guinea loves his mom!  Oh, God damn.  I care about family.  Uh-oh.  I don't know why I'm Harvey Farris.  Family.  I'll tell you something else I don't like about him.  This mother, Frank.  This year, I was really focusing on my sobriety  and getting myself healthy,  and it feels great to be back on TV. 
[03:54:30]  His new show, Dripping in Red Sauce.  Oh!  What?  What?  And tanning lotion.  Oh, look out!  It's more of a family affair  than the first pumping fun we saw on the Jersey Shore.  Yeah, that's good.  I wouldn't say it's toned down,  but it's a little more mature.  Hey, that's what we want.  We take deep issues,  like the trickle-down theory,  and we break it if it really worked.  I mean, I'm worried...  It's mature.  Ever since I got a little bit of money, 
[03:55:00]  I'm worried about the economy.  Yeah.  I said,  where the fuck did those IRS emails go?  Right?  And then my brother turns around and says,  maybe it's in Gina's cunt.  We got good fun.  We got good fun.  Edgy.  A little edgy.  All due respect,  love Gina.  All due respect.  All due respect.  It's a show which follows his family  who all live within a block of each other.  Of course, of course.  As they open a tanning salon! 
[03:55:30]  Tanning!  I got good money that says one of them is a DJ.  Yes.  You should open a tanning salon, Ed.  You're Italian.  Oh, why did I do that?  Tanning salon.  Ready for this next line?  Are you ready?  Strap in.  Yeah.  No secrets are safe in this family.  Oh!  Don't spill the beans.  Yeah.  No secrets are safe. 
[03:56:00]  I'm a homosexual.  What?  I like dicks in my butt.  What?  Mike?  What?  I mean...  Hey, no secrets is safe.  No?  Mike?  Who's the saint for secrets?  St. Gina Yonavisi?  He's dead.  Yes.  Anna Kornikova just walked by.  Oh, what?  How?  I swear she just walked by.  She's the intern.  No, I'm telling you.  Anna Kornikova just walked by her studio.  No, she looks like her, though.  Believe me.  Can you go try to get her on the show?  I've seen that walking down the hall, huh? 
[03:56:30]  She's like, hello, Nisa.  Hey, look, Nisa.  Oh, my God.  Fucking pussy melting your mouth.  I swear to God.  Come to our tanning salon.  We'll give you some nice baked ziti when you're done crisping your skin.  It's like running your tongue over Brajol.  Brajol.  She's got a pussy like Frick.  So is this his last, like...  This is his last hurrah.  This is it.  It has to be.  All right.  No secrets are safe in this family. 
[03:57:00]  That rule holds true at the dinner table.  Some good Italian dinner table.  Where his mom's marinara sauce and pasta...  Fuck them.  ...are a Sunday staple.  You better sit down, because the only thing heavier than the bread is the secrets that we divulge.  It's like a McLaughlin group with guineas.  Yeah, what the fuck?  The biggest new issue, taxation, immigration reform. 
[03:57:30]  Go, Mike.  Hey, our borders, they're fucking running across them like cockroaches.  Gun control.  Is it a possible thing?  Antonio, you're pissed.  Hey, what about, you know, they did that Fast and Furious thing with the guns?  Yeah, they should race.  They should race me, my fucking car, huh?  Forget about it.  I get more pussy than anybody.  I get so much gush.  It's so bad.  This is so...  Are you ready for this one? 
[03:58:00]  Like an Irish show would be drinking whiskey and beating their wives.  It's real mollies.  Hey, let's just have a little wee drink before bedtime.  Hey, let me knock around the old violin chain a bit.  Nothing keeps secrets like a woman that gets beaten.  It's an old, old molly secret.  This is every bad stereotype.  Well, the situation says a home-cooked meal is a refreshing break from the room service call  he frequently made while traveling on the road. 
[03:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  In a Kornikova.  Hey!  I mean, Jesus.  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  Step up.  Now you're banged up.  How you doing, man?  What's your name?  Joanna.  Joanna.  And you're an intern for?  Just Jenny.  Just Jenny.  Jenny Hutt.  Yep.  How is she?  Are you her niece?  Is she a needy?  I'm her cousin.  Second cousin.  Second cousin.  Is she needy?  A little.  She is very needy, right?  She's very needy.  I like her a lot, but she's fucking needy. 
[03:59:00]  You see her tweets?  Yeah.  Please follow me.  Tweet me.  Follow me.  Oh, I mention.  I'm going to at mention you.  Hashtag needy.  She's a wonderful woman.  She is.  I do love her.  So what do you do?  I answer the phone, and I edit the sound clips.  All right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Sounds reasonable.  That's all right.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  We see you walk by all the time.  I just wanted you to come in and say hi.  Fun neighborly hello.  Yes. 
[03:59:30]  Very nice.  All right.  Take it easy.  There she goes.  See you later.  Say hi to Jenny.  All right.  Yeah, it was good.  There she goes.  All right.  Jenny's.  It's going to be an awkward.  I'm like, later.  I'm like, oh, I'll see you later.  Thank you.  Answer call.  Fucking window gives us beer goggles.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think that window.  Yeah, it goes.  I thought you were a different person. 
[04:00:00]  I think that window.  It was a little blurry or something.  You know what?  We looked through it.  We need Don Wicklin to get us a prescription window here.  Because obviously, there's an issue.  She's still eight.  We're worried.  I don't know.  No, we was fucking hanging out.  I'll tell you what we wasn't keeping secrets from each other.  No, no, no.  All right.  My favorite thing that Ma makes is everything.  Oh, there you go. 
[04:00:30]  What the fuck?  I love that someone in a network was like...  How many times are they going to say, Ma?  Hey, Ma!  And then it's going to play some fluty fucking edited music.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She can be a little crazy.  Oh.  And then it cuts to her.  Cut and stir in sauce with the music.  I love my boys.  Oh, they're so...  They tried.  They're so nasty.  But they love their mother.  And the girls they bring around. 
[04:01:00]  I wish they would stay longer.  Hey, Ma.  I don't know if she's Jewish, but...  I sell down every night, Ma.  What's your fucking...  Yeah.  All right.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  He's selling the show, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  He's got it.  He goes, my favorite thing that Ma makes is everything, says the Situation, who watches  his weight on weekdays, but calls it a cheat day whenever Linda serves his favorite homemade  chocolate mousse cake.  Oh, boy.  Oh, fuck.  It's just...  It's just... 
[04:01:30]  This thing's...  It's almost like...  What channel is this on?  I'm going to guess.  I think it's like...  Let me guess.  TV Guide or something.  Is it?  No way.  TV Guide Family or something.  No way.  TV Guide Family.  It's a bit of a drop.  Not the TV Guide Channel.  The other TV Guide Channel.  What is it?  That's the double-A ball of television.  Yeah.  Drop-off from MTV.  Listen, you go play in TV Guide...  You go play TV Guide League for a couple years.  Yeah, yeah.  You're in TV Guide League.  We'll try to bring you up.  What is it?  It's TVGN.  Oh. 
[04:02:00]  It's TV Guide Channel.  TV Guide Network.  Oh, yeah.  They're trying to make it cool.  I say TVGN.  Oh, and look.  It looks like The Sopranos.  It's a family.  What other shows do they have on this network?  The TV Guide.  The Bold and the Beautiful.  The Young and the Restless.  Oh, my God.  And The Sopranos.  And The Sopranos.  All right.  Is there like a preview video from the show?  I'll bet there is.  Let me tell you something.  You guys are going to be the flagship show of the TV Guide Channel. 
[04:02:30]  Mike, I'm excited for this.  Oh, my God.  This is huge.  Well, we got the slug line.  Uh-oh.  This is what...  I mean, all that other stuff is nonsense.  That's all build-up.  This is what's going to sell the show.  You ready?  Mm-hmm.  Despite the family meals, the situation insists that it isn't a leave-it-to-beaver show.  Oh!  Oh!  There's some real things going on.  Ain't no leave-it-to-beaver.  There'll be some food being thrown.  Every single person has a large personality.  You never really know what's going to happen. 
[04:03:00]  Seriously.  My sister got murdered three weeks in.  It's a pretty gripping, ongoing trial.  We'll fill you in as you watch the episodes.  You think they'll threaten each other?  Hey, don't make me whack you.  Oh, look out.  That's what Italians do.  Hey, I'll whack you.  I'm going to pay a black guy to kill you.  What?  Let me beat Roland to the punch.  No.  Oh. 
[04:03:30]  Let's just no right now.  No, Roland.  This is the same network that brought you Alan Thicke's reality show, Unusually Thicke.  What is that?  That sounds disgusting.  What the fuck?  That sounds like something you go to the doctor because of.  That sounds like how a girl describes an ex-boyfriend.  Yes.  She's like, he was Unusually Thicke.  Doctor, it's coming out Unusually Thicke.  I really think I need something.  I mean, I think the sex was good.  He was Unusually Thicke.  Well, my name's Alan Thicke, and I have a wide penis. 
[04:04:00]  I'm what some refer to as a lip ripper.  Yes.  Do they have a preview for the show?  They do not.  No preview even?  Oh, that's good.  Oh, that's bad.  One has to exist.  Come on.  That's a bad sign.  Not on YouTube or anything?  You want to throw a clip out there for the people.  They haven't been able to cull any entertaining moments from them hanging out at dinner?  Nothing.  Hey.  They can't put two minutes together.  I mean, not even a sizzle reel?  Okay, I believe this is a sizzle reel. 
[04:04:30]  All right.  Let's go.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Let's pull down.  Oh, yes, it is.  I've been this excited for your trailer since Dark Knight Rises came out.  Mr. Sorrentino, once the show is over, then you have my permission to die.  Oh, no.  This is the sizzle reel, because obviously a production company made it, and they were able  to sell it to TV Guide Network, so TV Guide Network, they did this.  Okay. 
[04:05:00]  They just bought it.  Oh, this is so exciting.  So what is it?  A Lambo he pulls up in?  Yeah, this is all Sorrentino.  A Lamborghini?  So he rented that for an hour.  What a hack.  Mr. Sorrentino, are you going to, is your daughter going to prom?  That's the question.  No, we're going to make a mad sick TV trailer.  By the way, if anybody out there, if I could lease a, I want to lease a Jaguar F-Type.  Jaguar?  So if anybody. 
[04:05:30]  That would be great if they did a frame-for-frame Dark Knight Rises trailer with the Sorrentino  family.  Weren't you part of that car club?  What happened?  No, I just, I want to lease the Jaguar.  I'm going to drive it real fast.  Go forward.  Let's go.  Let's play the sizzle reel.  Wow.  Reality's biggest star.  The world really is, Mike.  The situation.  Canceled.  It's coming home.  No place to call home.  I'm either staying in an airport, in a hotel, my brother's house, and even my sister's house. 
[04:06:00]  Wait, hold on.  Pause it.  He's a vagabond?  I can't see.  He's like, I got a real nasty habit.  Call me a vagabond?  I hope that don't mean gay.  Does it mean I'm stacking cash and getting pushy?  You're a vagabond, not me.  What is that?  You bitch not mean retarded?  I'm on the road doing sold out shows of nothing.  To everybody. 
[04:06:30]  I go on the road and bore people.  Roll, roll, no.  Roll and no.  No.  That's two no's.  We're not taking the situations, uh, family.  He was cool to us, though.  He was cool, but, I mean, this show.  He was really cool to us, actually.  Yeah, but he was very famous then.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Let's see the rest of this.  This show is like Amos and Andy for Italians.  This is Amos and Andy of Italians.  Let's see.  So he doesn't have a home.  I can't believe you're getting a haircut right now.  It may not be the most sanitary thing to get the haircut. 
[04:07:00]  It's like the opposite of sanitary.  Oh, that fucking girl.  It's a stupid haircut.  Who cares?  You sweep it up.  Who hasn't gotten their haircut in the fucking...  She looks like an SNL character.  She looks like she's made up to look like a guinea broad.  Absolutely.  Someone in wigs at NBC was like, yeah, we can make her look pretty.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Mike, you're getting your fucking haircut.  Yeah, I drove all the way from Staten Island, you fuck. 
[04:07:30]  She looks like a bit.  And I love that he's eating while he's getting his haircut.  Hey, whatever.  Yeah, that makes it crazier.  That's a taste of what you'll see on the show.  That's like, you understand a little bit of where we're going with directionally with  the show.  Yeah, I want to stop this now in case it's getting too heady for you.  All right, we're going to do a lot of egret, a lot of food flinging.  It's going to be crazy.  I got a nice car.  I got a nice car, but I got nowhere to park.  I'm a vagabond. 
[04:08:00]  I'm a modern day romantic poet.  Except I get my hair cut in kitchens.  Yeah, I ain't.  Meet the family.  My family will always know me by Michael.  As opposed to the situation.  I don't think I know how to say that.  My family will always know me by the name that they gave me.  As opposed to everybody else who has no idea who I am anymore. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Just walks through life with, like, not a care in the world.  Charismatic, carefree.  Blazy is a great word for Michael.  But it is a definition of multitasking right here.  We're a family business.  Clothes, clubs, painting salons.  But we're a family friend.  That's great porn.  I wanted to be a star.  So when this happened to Michael,  Why did this happen to me?  I'm the brother of Rich, you know, the best characteristics.  I am the man.  My tattoo is actually a portrait of myself.  I have a exceptional amount of cards. 
[04:09:00]  It says the man won.  He's the man.  Oh, my God.  He's trying to put it off.  So he calls himself the man.  Oh, no.  This is so bad.  And he has a card.  The man won and the man two.  I love that he's brutally jealous of nothing.  You know what?  He's like, I was supposed to be the star.  I was supposed to.  Look at my man boys.  We found a new show.  I am watching every episode.  Oh, I will watch this. 
[04:09:30]  I can't wait to hate to watch this.  I'm going to DVR this shit when I get home.  Good job, Sorrentino.  You've baited me into it.  The man.  Because he knows the situation is already broken out.  It's time for the man to break out.  To be quite honest, when Mike got famous, I started jerking off and crying.  Because I think that should have been my role.  I'm the middle brother.  I'm supposed to be famous.  I've also done nothing to build any skill of any sort without I should be famous.  I've never spent years developing anything.  I've got to brand myself as the man. 
[04:10:00]  And he's a bit softer than the situation, by the way.  He's taking his shirt off.  His fucking hacksaw Jim Duggan body.  Looks like an old tights up high.  Old school wrestler body.  We do a lot of things in this family.  We open laundry places, money laundering places.  We open tax shelters all over New Jersey.  And a tanning salon.  I've got a tattoo on my arm.  It says the man.  The man, because I'm the man.  So it means it.  Oh my God. 
[04:10:30]  You go back, I've got to see that again.  Yeah, let's just see the man again.  I've got to see the man tattoo on his soft body.  Oh!  Oh no.  Look at that.  He really does have...  If he was a wrestler, he'd have to wear tights that come up over his body.  He'd have to wear a singlet.  He couldn't wear a fucking...  I used to do cycles.  Then I started getting lazy and guess what happened?  Turns out your body turns to mush.  My body's soft enough for that one-eyed girl to eat.  Oh shit! 
[04:11:00]  Oh shit!  Mashed potato body!  He's in Bruno San Martino shape.  Almost in shape.  Almost.  He really does have O-Lineman body.  The man.  That's his brother.  I'm supposed to be famous.  I wear Joey Butterfugo pants above my belly button.  He's a hero.  Oh, go back even further because I want to hear him bitch about not being famous.  That was the other guy, I think. 
[04:11:30]  That's the older brother.  Oh yeah!  Frank.  He's the man who thinks he's already famous.  Well hold on.  The man is fucking...  Just like Game of Thrones, you've got to give me halfway through the first season to understand  who all the characters are.  Oh right.  The character developments.  Yeah, exactly.  These are deep.  Frank.  The oldest brother, I wanted to be a star.  So when this happened to Michael...  F***.  Why did this happen to me?  I'm the brother of Rick, you know, the best characteristics.  I am the man.  My tattoo is actually a portrait of myself. 
[04:12:00]  I have an exceptional amount of cards.  It says the man one, the man two, all the way to the man nine.  Who does that?  Whoa!  I'm the chief executive officer.  Of what?  Well, your heart, you can't survive.  He just said that as a descriptive.  I'm the chief executive officer.  So am I.  He has nine cards.  He has nine cards.  By the way, terrible spending.  One is a Dachshund B210.  The other one's a burned up Buick I found on the side of the BQE.  Nuff said.  But you should see the man seven. 
[04:12:30]  The man seven.  I got an 88 Honda Accord hatchback.  It holds Cutlass.  I can sit it at my investments.  I'm the CEO of, I don't know.  Buying unused cards.  Buying used cards.  I'm slapping dumb license plates on him.  Of his brother's company.  It took me four years to figure out what CEO stands for.  Why are you jealous of your brother if that's the only reason you got a job?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He's got the cards.  Without your heart, you can't survive. 
[04:13:00]  Without Melissa, you can't survive.  I'm clean at everything.  I pay for their cars, buy their clothes, run their personal lives.  I don't even like any of the family members speaking to me.  I want them to speak to Melissa and Melissa can relay it to me.  It just can't help.  Even the sister has the situation face.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  It's very over the top New York Italian.  Yeah.  I run everything because they don't know how to do nothing.  Yeah.  I wipe their butts.  I shake their pee-pees when they're done going wee-wee. 
[04:13:30]  I do everything for them.  I'm glad there's somebody with a good head on her shoulders.  I don't want no one talking to me.  Everyone talks to Melissa.  Then she writes them down.  That's a bad idea.  One episode is just Melissa plucking all her eyebrows out and penciling them in.  It's fucking fantastic.  Justin Stangle from Letterman just texted me saying,  I'm getting a license plate that says the man 10.  Just a couple of them.  But he has to go to New Jersey. 
[04:14:00]  Yeah.  Because you know he's saving up so he can have a...  So he can have a 10.  What am I going to do with my first Sorrentino check?  Right.  I'm getting another license plate.  We're looking for the man 10.  Who the fuck got the man 10?  You know he's saving up for...  Give me the address.  Oh, would he be mad?  If you tell me, who the fuck got that plate?  Fucking guy is just serious.  The Bulls.  For someone who'll get the man 10.  For a nice round number. 
[04:14:30]  I'm the chief executive officer, in case you didn't know.  CEO.  Let's see what Melissa's about.  Take care of them.  Even my mother.  You give everybody your phone number.  And you really need to scan these guys a little more thoroughly.  What?  My kids are grown.  I'm single.  I'm going back to what I missed years ago.  My nephew tonight is 11, Peaches.  If you don't come home by a certain time, I'm locking you out.  I'm just glad they haven't created any phony situations for the sake of the show.  Oh, the fucking inmates have taken over the prison, it looks like. 
[04:15:00]  Oh, this is just...  This is crazy.  Maybe Melissa should go get her own fucking house.  Locking out mom from her house.  You live with your mother.  Right.  And you're locking her out.  Oh, wow.  She doesn't play.  Oh.  By a certain time, I'm locking you out.  There's really nothing typical about us.  No.  Myself and Mark have always been in comedy.  Wait.  I can't even...  There's the DJ.  The man is a DJ on the side. 
[04:15:30]  I called it.  You said it.  The man DJs.  I felt like someone was going to DJ.  Oh.  The man.  Is that his...  What is that?  It may be like a laptop case?  It's his bedroom door in his mom's house.  It's like all diamond encrusted.  And it says the man.  Can I show you to the CEO estate?  Hey, this is where the magic happens.  Mom gave me the basement room.  Because I'm the CEO.  I keep a mattress on the floor because if it was on a bed, you'd hit your head on the ceiling. 
[04:16:00]  Most people have a man cave.  This is the man cave.  The man.  Because I'm the man.  And myself and Mark have always been in competition.  I can't even eat a turkey sandwich without Mark telling me how to eat it, when I should  eat it.  Oh.  That's crazy.  Me staying sober is a daily struggle.  I've been the wild one my whole life.  It's sort of what has made me, but at the same time also what has destroyed me.  We love each other no matter what. 
[04:16:30]  Oh, I'm good.  You want to cry?  We're going to stick together.  Oh, good.  Most of the time.  He just said he doesn't talk to anybody in the family.  Right.  Just a minute ago in the preview, he was like, I don't talk to nobody.  I don't talk to nobody.  But we're family.  We're loving family.  That's it?  Yeah, I can't wait for the turkey sandwich episode.  Yeah, that looks good.  When the fuck does this start?  That's Sweeps Week.  Yeah, when the fuck does this start?  When does this fucking start?  It must start this week if it's in the paper.  It's the man?  Is that the name of the video?  Wait, go back. 
[04:17:00]  It's the man.  It's the man.  Oh, man.  Is that his?  What?  That might be his channel.  I'd love to see some videos of him.  Maybe he's DJing.  Video blog number three.  No shoes, no problem.  Let's train.  Is that him training?  No.  I don't think it's him.  No.  I thought we hit a gold mine.  Come on.  What is this garbage?  It's like parkour.  Yeah, it's just a parkour video.  It's the man. 
[04:17:30]  He's going to be a breakout star, I think, in this show.  The man.  Why would you not start a new YouTube account with the teaser on it?  Why would you put the teaser with all your personal cell phone videos?  Maybe that's what you do.  Bro, I'm giving them an inside look at what CEOs do.  Yeah.  I'm letting you know how CEOs think.  Dude, there's a ton of parkour videos on this.  Yo, you know what's man-el parkour?  But I can't get up that high.  Is that the only video online? 
[04:18:00]  It did.  It's the only taste, man.  We're going to have to watch the show.  Hello, I'm interested in purchasing your 86 Toyota Tercel.  Well, if I do buy it, it will have the privilege of being the man tent.  You think he already has the license plate?  It's on his desk.  It starts next month.  Next month.  This show's in trouble.  Yeah.  How long does it go?  It's probably like six episodes. 
[04:18:30]  Probably a little small.  Does anything get canceled off the TV Guide channel?  How could you not get viewers?  How do you get canceled out of there?  What's a low rating on the TV Guide?  Sorry, we're going to replace it with the grid.  They canceled the 8 p.m. time slot.  Yeah, they canceled a time where the listings are.  Guys, we're going to show all the other TV channels.  It didn't do well, so they got rid of the 8 p.m. listings.  She thinks.  Oh, that's fucking great.  On one half of your screen, you see the Sorrentino's on the other half. 
[04:19:00]  Everything that's on every other channel.  Everything you could switch to.  That's how good the show is.  We show you everything else that's on, and people stick with us.  We ain't afraid.  Are you a waiting room?  Then you should put us on.  I kind of want to get them all on.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, I would definitely say.  I want the whole gang in here.  All of them?  And do one of those goof interviews.  The full cast.  Where we make believe we're on their side.  And they're like, hey, they were insulting each other.  You're like, oh!  Can I please just sit on the couch?  Oh, please.  You can come to that. 
[04:19:30]  The amount of...  Yeah, but you have to blow out your hair and come in a tracksuit.  I've got to be like, hey, I'm the man.  What, you're the man?  Just a fan of the show.  Just a fan of the show.  Bro, the only thing I love more than you guys' work is my mother's gravy.  And no disrespect, Mrs. Soir and T, though, I think it's as good.  I think it's as good.  Your mother made.  Welcome to the old party, Sam.  Yes. 
[04:20:00]  Oh, that's fucking great.  I can't wait for that show.  I read that shit this morning.  I'm like, holy fuck.  That show was made for us.  Paulie D.  Paulie D.  Night.  This is the Sorrentino.  Oh, shit.  What are some of those other spinoffs?  The Paulie D. spinoff was a bomb.  That was a bomb.  Snooki and J.O.I. was big.  Why?  What about Vinny?  There's like four seasons.  What happened to Vinny?  Vinny got a talk show.  Yeah, but that went away fast.  It went away fast.  And we liked Vinny a lot.  He had that show where it was in his house.  That was the talk show in the house. 
[04:20:30]  Oh, right.  With his family.  With Lil Wayne.  Eating some sauce at the table.  With Lil Wayne.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  It came to his house.  It's a pretty good idea, actually.  Yeah.  Good concept.  Let me guess.  His mother cooked?  Yep.  And doesn't give a fuck how famous these people are.  You know, that type of thing.  Yeah.  Kind of works.  Meh.  Were they racist?  Towards Lil Wayne?  No, you're not going to leave him alone in the living room.  That's what a good friend is.  Count the silver.  These Jersey Shore kids, they couldn't figure out how to buy a house? 
[04:21:00]  Invest.  They all went back to living at their parents' houses.  Weren't they making like a hundred, a thousand an episode or some shit?  Hey, that mortgage.  They were doing really well, yeah.  That thing's for a long time, that mortgage, huh?  What is that?  It's like fucking five, six years?  You got to buy?  Yeah, but then you got to pay the mortgage and buy sneakers.  You don't know that.  You got to get a house with columns?  I just bought the house.  I want a house with columns.  Thirty years?  Mean year.  Oh, fuck. 
[04:21:30]  Yeah, but what if I don't got it?  Yeah.  Ah, look.  I don't got it.  Come back.  Yeah, that's a shame.  So that's that, then.  Ah, that's a shame.  Oh, there is one more story.  Yeah.  Rory McIlroy.  I had my issue with United Airlines.  Oh.  That was certainly documented on this radio show.  What is Ghana?  Oh, no, that was Delta.  Delta.  Rory McIlroy, though.  Where the fuck is the story? 
[04:22:00]  I fucking lost the story.  Rory.  Oh, man.  I'm not going to find it again.  Rory's got a situation.  Talk amongst yourselves.  Hey, welcome to the McIlroys.  Hey, we're going to be drinking and beating our wives.  Fighting.  Hey, like a fighting.  If there's ever a problem with the McIlroys.  What happened to the potatoes?  Heels like another blight.  Our dad's a little old school.  I don't like anyone you bring home. 
[04:22:30]  They bother me.  Paul, you don't want to talk to his new girlfriend.  Oh, kill her in the backyard.  The McIlroy's right after the Sorrentinos.  I'd like to kill those Sorrentinos.  Rory.  Rory McIlroy is one of the best players in the world on the PGA.  And recently, United lost my luggage when I went to Cancun.  All they did was lose some baby diapers. 
[04:23:00]  It was a hassle for a day.  But what are you going to do?  I'm still mad about it.  But Rory McIlroy, they lost his golf clubs.  You know, the thing that he uses for his job.  So he tweeted United, it says, hey, at United, landed in Dublin yesterday morning from Newark,  and still no golf clubs.  Sort of need them this week.  Can someone help? 
[04:23:30]  They should have answered him back on, you know, you don't have to play golf.  Oh, see.  Oh, I do.  Oh, you lost your golf clubs.  I've heard from a lot of people after my United experience, and it seems like they lose luggage a lot.  What's going on with that?  You play golf?  You made money at that?  You make money at that?  I don't know how.  You support yourself?  So United writes back to Rory McIlroy's Twitter, we understand how important your clubs are to you. 
[04:24:00]  Please follow and DM us.  They got Rory McIlroy to follow him?  Us your bag, reference ID, we'd like to follow up.  J.H.  Oh, who is that?  That's probably a fake name.  J.H.  I bet he's the CEO.  Oh.  I'm the CEO.  Wink.  Wink.  I make all the important decisions. 
[04:24:30]  Like which car I'm going to buy to make the man 10.  What's going to be 10?  That should be an episode of the show.  I think we go as high as 15 by the end of the season.  I think we stop at 15.  How much do I want to see the jaws of life cutting to the man 6?  Tragic news.  The man 6.  Coincidentally ran into the man 4.  Wrapped around a telephone pole.  The man 7.  Not driven by the man, but by his assistant. 
[04:25:00]  But the man took the man 8 to the accident scene.  We didn't realize that he had been using the man 9.  Right.  The man.  He's got to be shit.  You know how many people on a daily basis when they're in traffic and he's in front of them  are like, look at this fucking asshole.  Look at this asshole.  You do not read that plate and not say out loud in your car, look at this fucking asshole.  Look at this fucking guy. 
[04:25:30]  Man 7, one of his six other ones.  And then if you found out he owned all six of them.  And then you do that thing where you go around the right and start speeding up and go, I've  got to see what this fucking asshole looks like.  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That thing is.  Oh, what a dick.  What a guido douche.  You do know that he only has probably the man 8.  Yeah.  And he found everybody else with the man 1 through and filmed that and make him believe 
[04:26:00]  that's his cars.  How do you feel about contributing to a possible Emmy award winning show?  Right.  Now, your car will be prominently featured in the opening credits.  When they do the montage of how badass I am, it's going to look like I own all the bad  cars.  We all know I only own eight.  Yeah.  It will look like I have a fleet.  The fleet.  Do you know what a fleet is?  It's a shit ton.  You notice they only showed the plates, too? 
[04:26:30]  Yeah.  They didn't show the cars.  They've got to be the shittiest cars.  If you had the raw audio, it'd be like, go, go, go, go, go.  I think he's walking up.  Just another asshole that's like, get away from my car.  I'm the man 5.  I really wish I could afford to get that donut spare off the number 7.  The man 7's rolling the donut spare.  Or someone grabbed the man.  Yeah.  And so he's like, fuck, how do I spend this? 
[04:27:00]  Because the man won.  I look like an asshole.  I've got to buy another car.  Mike, can I borrow some money?  I'll buy nine of them.  Mike, I need $10,000 to buy some cars.  I'm going to go buy the grocery store and get a car trader.  How much is insurance on nine cars?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  It's not an umbrella policy.  Fleet policy, definitely.  That's what TV Guide had to put out the money for.  Yeah.  We'll do the show if you insure all of my man vehicles.  My man vehicles.  I need you to pay on every one of my men. 
[04:27:30]  If we do well in the ratings, my bonus is the man 10.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  It's in the contract.  What's in the box, by the way?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  It's Sal's birthday.  Birthday.  Oh, yay.  Happy birthday, Sal.  How old is Sal?  I don't know.  I don't care enough to ask.  You don't even care, right?  No, I like Sal.  He's made a major turnaround around here.  How old is Sal?  I don't know.  Where is Sal?  Where is he? 
[04:28:00]  What could you get for his birthday?  He got cake.  Because we're going home.  I thought he was going to slack.  Oh, here he comes.  Down the hallway.  Yeah, because I want a piece of cake or something, maybe.  Is it good?  What kind of cake we got?  Maybe it's cannoli.  Hey, is it cannoli?  Not better than my mom's cannoli.  Oh, no.  My mom made it.  I love it.  Oh, yeah.  She puts the regal in it.  And parmesan and...  How's it going, guys? 
[04:28:30]  How old are you?  24.  Oh, fuck.  You're only 24?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  You're like a 70s 24.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like in the 70s, that's how they look.  Yeah, yeah.  Just older.  The dry look from Gillette.  No, actually, he's got the wet look.  He's got the brill cream look, but the beard from...  I don't know.  Like when Tom Sillick was doing cigarette commercials.  Open the cake.  All right, let's do it.  Nothing refreshes me like a camel.  Yeah.  Happy birthday to you.  Oh!  Ah, what is it? 
[04:29:00]  Aw.  Happy birthday, Salvador, which means Rowan definitely put the order in on that.  Isn't it Salvatore?  Yeah.  It's not Salvador.  Let's say Salvador.  Salvador.  Salvador.  Like Salvador.  I don't know, I guess.  Yeah.  We're actually in Rowan's place.  What kind of cake is it?  Black and white.  What?  Oh, I hate that.  Anthony's against it.  Get it?  Hey, black and white cookie made Jerry throw up. 
[04:29:30]  Ah.  Whoa.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  You're still at the age where like your parents do a party for you?  They did like...  I was born on Father's Day, so like they did a Father's Day sort of birthday.  Are you going to split it with your dad?  Yeah.  That sucks.  Yeah, it does suck.  Whatever.  Do they wrap it all into one?  Do they make one cake?  No, actually I had a cannoli.  They make this like... 
[04:30:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah, cannoli cake.  Mad on the fucking cannoli.  Mad on.  Of course.  They make this like...  You should be a guest on the Tarantinos.  Yeah, you're going to do a guest spot?  Yeah.  They make like a cannoli that's like huge, and you can break the cannoli and you eat it  like hummus almost.  It's fucking awesome.  Oh, man.  Nice.  That does sound good.  What kind of icing we got on this?  Not to be confused with ISIS.  Today, Salvatore comes over the house and cuts a piece of birthday cake. 
[04:30:30]  That's a whole episode.  It's fantastic.  Do you understand how much material we're sitting on as a family?  I can only imagine the poor editor for that show sitting there going, I have five minutes  and nothing else.  But you know how that came about.  Oh, give me that motherfucker.  His family was bothering him all through his MTV success.  And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then it got so bad for him personally that he had to go back to them and say, you  know that idea?  Watch what you say in front of him.  He'll put it on his show. 
[04:31:00]  I think we got something.  They broke him when he was in recovery.  No, thank you, Sal.  Oh, that's pretty goddamn good.  Oh, I'm okay.  Yeah, they broke him when he was getting off drugs.  And he was finally like, fine, I'll do it.  Like a Coke sweat.  And they're like, oh, we got him.  He said yes.  You can't turn back on your word.  No, not to your family.  Yeah.  Still trying to pull some Michael Corleone Fredo shit on him.  How's that cake?  It's pretty good.  Pretty amazing.  I just imagine the editor alone in the editing suite with like a half-empty bottle of gin 
[04:31:30]  and a filterless cigarette.  I have nothing to work with here.  I mean nothing.  Let's make believe the guy has nine cars.  We're not getting nine cars.  They gave me 15 minutes of raw footage of just license plates.  This guy's shirtless and everything.  He shouldn't be.  But he's shirtless.  I've started putting stuff back in that I cut out.  We got nothing.  What is this?  I don't know.  Oh, hi, girls.  Some whores.  Those are someone's little angels. 
[04:32:00]  All right.  We're going home, Dan.  Good seeing you.  Good seeing you.  Is Jimmy back tomorrow?  I don't think so.  Oh, wait, wait.  Maybe not.  If he's not, come back tomorrow.  Yeah, why not?  Got a good vibe going.  You're busy.  I'm trying to see what I got tomorrow.  Hey, we're family.  We'll figure it out.  And it's crazy.  Hey, you don't know what you're going to see.  No.  So great job, Dan.  Dan Soder on Twitter.  Absolutely.  S-O-D-E-R, right? 
[04:32:30]  Yeah.  That was fun.  DanSoder.com.  Is that it?  Everyone good?  Oh, yeah.  I want to thank Pat from Train for coming by.  He was great.  He started off our show today.  That was fun.  We never have a guest that early.  It was weird.  No.  We had a stall a little bit.  We shun guests that early.  We're still drinking coffee, waking up, and we have our first guest.  Like, fuck.  Yeah.  But it worked out well.  Fun.  Fun show.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  Later.  The Opie and Anthony show has drawn to a close.

You two can be a part of it.  Dan Soder is still here.  Hi, buddy.  And Denny walked down the hall.  Because he goes, I heard you guys had some cake down here. 
[04:42:30]  I heard there was some cake.  Yeah.  His mooch detectors went off.  You hear us talking about the Sorrentinos.  He's like, what?  Yeah.  You know, in all this talk about the Sorrentinos, nobody, I mean, is the cake still in there?  How did you guys briefly mention a cake?  Yeah.  We went through all that radio.  Something threw, uh, someone threw something for a cake.  Did you guys say cake?  There was a cake in there?  Oh, I see a cake.  Oh, you guys were good.  It's not, it's not completely eaten.  Yeah.  Were you guys going to, are you going to finish that, or is it for whoever, or? 
[04:43:00]  Sal, you gave Denny a piece of cake.  I, to be fair, I was calling Denny on the phone.  I tried calling even his cell phone to have him come down and get a piece of cake.  Why is that?  Thank you.  I like Denny.  Good for you.  People think I fucking, I hate him.  I loved it.  Good for you.  Good for you.  Good for you.  And it's, it's your birthday.  How old are you today?  I'm 24 today.  It's a rough 24, huh?  That's a long 24.  My, oh my.  Well, congratulations on.  Oh, nothing.  One more year.  I'm making you 24.  One more year you get to rent a car. 
[04:43:30]  Huh?  Yeah.  You can't rent a car?  How geeked up about that are you?  Oh, I can't wait, dude.  How fucking, how jacked up are you?  Are you going to rent a car in a year for reasonable insurance rates?  You could have your own reality show.  It's going to go amazing.  Oh, I love that, that, that pit bull stuff today on the show.  My sister has a pit bull and she got it in the worst way imaginable.  One day her and her husband were like, well, I think we're going to get a dog soon.  The next day they were like, well, we went on Craigslist. 
[04:44:00]  Oh boy.  And there was a pit bull in Harlem.  People who own pit bulls defend them like women who date ex-cons.  And, yeah.  Hey, how are you?  Yeah, they're like.  Nicole Ryan is here from the morning mashup.  They're like, you don't understand him.  It's like abusive boyfriends.  You don't understand my pit bull.  You don't understand, yeah.  He loves me.  And then, so they have this pit bull now that they've got on Craigslist for free.  Yeah.  From Harlem. 
[04:44:30]  So, basically, they're sharing their apartment with a running back.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, because like.  A murderous running back.  Because, like, I love dogs.  Yeah.  And so you let them jump on you and, you know.  Oh, kisses.  Say hello.  And then the first time you felt like those horse hooves on your shoulders and, like, you just looked at his jowls.  And you're like, wait a minute.  This could be the end of my life.  Like, you can't be this close to me, dog.  Those pit bulls can push you down.  Yeah.  They're like, you're going to go down now.  And you're like, okay.  Like, dogs are not supposed to be stronger than you. 
[04:45:00]  That's what's cute about them.  Yeah.  Like, wait, no.  If there was a fight.  Between me and that dog.  That dog's winning.  When that cop called up and said that he shot one in the head.  It just kept going.  And it kept coming.  Like the Terminator.  Yeah.  I don't like to hear about violence against animals.  We probably deserved it.  This is what I love, people.  I saw a similar thing on Facebook.  Yeah.  My friend's wife was like, I stopped watching Game of Thrones because they were mean to  a dog.  Yeah, I would too.  It's like, yeah.  But you don't care about humans? 
[04:45:30]  Of course I care about humans.  Rape and murder?  I'm used to seeing that.  I don't like.  Rape.  You're used to rape.  Like in movies and stuff.  Yeah, I am.  So you're much more comfortable with humans being murdered than dogs being mistreated.  Not in real life, but like on TV or movies, yeah.  Okay.  Like, what do you get more pissed off at?  Michael Vick?  Or what's his name?  The NFL player who went and shot some people.  Aaron Hernandez.  Aaron Hernandez.  Who really gets your goat more?  Yeah.  Who are you more pissed off at?  Aaron Hernandez or Michael Vick? 
[04:46:00]  Honestly?  Yeah.  Michael Vick?  Yeah.  That's how it is.  It's so dumb.  And you know what?  That's the culture we have right now.  Yeah.  It's just like, those dogs.  Because I feel like they're helpless.  They are.  But they were pit bulls.  Yeah, but guess what?  Maybe he was doing good.  And I'm a person.  If there's another person with a gun, I'm just as helpless as a dog.  Yeah.  Because I can't fight a gun.  Both of them are evil motherfuckers.  Yeah.  What Michael Vick did was evil.  Evil.  Evil.  Right.  He had dogs in his trunk.  Aaron Hernandez murdered people. 
[04:46:30]  That's the number one thing that you can't do.  The only, really the only thing.  Right.  Besides rape is murder.  Right.  They could have fought back or tried.  Maybe if they saw it coming.  What if the dogs tried to fight back?  Yeah, it's a pit bull.  I know.  I just, I don't know.  I have a thing about animals.  I think I'm not the only person.  And I can't explain it.  It's probably wrong.  But I just.  No, I get it.  I know other people.  It's like, oh, the poor pop.  Or the poor kitty.  My sister has a kid now.  So we have a little baby niece.  And she was like, look.  And she, this weekend, she brought the niece down so the pit bull could lick the niece's face. 
[04:47:00]  Oh, dear.  That's a little scary.  And I was like, well, I won't bother getting attached to that baby.  Yeah.  Like, Sam.  Don't take your baby to a KFC anytime soon.  Yeah, exactly.  That would, I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The whole time she was doing it.  No, they love each other.  But you can't, like, lunge for it because you're just like, no.  Because then the dog will lunge at the baby.  No.  Oh, we get to eat it now?  As you lunge for the child.  We're all excited.  This is what I do when I get excited. 
[04:47:30]  Yeah.  I rip things apart with my dangerous face.  Specifically, small things.  Small, unformed humans.  Yeah, so you're just sitting there going, please don't do that.  No sudden movements.  Please don't do that.  No sudden movements.  But don't you feel like the majority of the time an animal knows that it's a baby?  Like, that they can sense that it's a child and that they're helpless?  No.  I feel like they can.  No?  I think people project intelligence on the animals that isn't there.  Right.  Where they're like, look, look, look how smart he is. 
[04:48:00]  Sit down.  Oh, because you beat him into understanding that command?  Right.  And now he gets that?  Like, I literally just saw a news story about a girl who got her face bitten off by a pit  bull and then wasn't allowed to eat at KFC.  You're telling me that pit bull didn't realize that that little girl was a little girl?  Yeah, it's like, or it did and it's like, I'm the baddest motherfucker ever.  As far as pit bulls go, I'm the man.  I'm the man then.  Yeah.  Ah, that's fucking, yeah. 
[04:48:30]  They don't, I don't think they understand.  No way.  No, because, because that's what it's called.  My dog is so smart.  Right.  How smart is it?  It shits on our carpet.  Yes.  That's how smart it is.  Our dog, like, kisses and snuffles, Parker.  It's not even a real, you don't even have a real dog.  It's like a shit zoo.  That is a real dog.  It's an animal.  It's not a...  I mean, it's a real dog.  I mean, technically, but it's way closer, like, what do you think it's closer to?  A pit bull or a rat?  A rat.  Okay.  How dare you talk about Leo like that? 
[04:49:00]  But a pit bull is close to a fucking silverback gorilla.  Yeah.  A grand stallion.  A Clydesdale.  It's the Clydesdales of dogs.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, when people get mad, and they go, yeah, that animal instinct kicked  in.  You know why they call it animal instinct?  Because all animals have it.  All right.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm wrong, apparently.  But you've never met my dog.  He acts like a cat.  Can it...  Exactly.  I do.  He's so independent. 
[04:49:30]  I've met some horrible cats.  Yeah.  Some real fucking assholes that are cats.  Have you ever had a conversation with a dog?  Have you ever...  Yeah.  All the time.  They're the best to talk to.  Thank you.  That's really their only purpose.  They don't talk back.  They don't speak the language.  Leo knows when I'm sad.  I can tell him what happened to me.  He doesn't know your sex.  He knows.  He has no clue.  He just knows that you're willing to pet him.  Right.  Oh.  He licks my tears.  Like, if I'm crying, he'll come in.  Yeah, because he's like, he's thirsty.  He's like...  Yeah, exactly.  He's not trying to take care of you. 
[04:50:00]  He's like...  Anything that tastes not like water.  Nicole, I want you to know something.  I hate you guys.  If your husband busted a load on your face, your dog would lick it off.  Yeah, I guarantee you.  Dogs drink antifreeze.  Yeah.  Yeah, they do.  And you know what it does to them?  It's not an intelligent animal.  It kills them.  I don't know.  This is why they're subservient to us.  I'm testing it tonight.  Nobody's even bothered to attempt to make a movie like Planet of the Apes, but with dogs.  Planet of the Dogs?  Oh, you mean never going to happen?  Right.  Because another animal will rise above them? 
[04:50:30]  People couldn't even take that movie Air Bud seriously.  They're like, that motherfucker's not playing basketball.  I'm like, does he really know the rules of the game?  I don't think so.  I don't think Air Bud does.  Look, he's smiling.  We also...  Air Bud 9, hip dysplasia.  Put him down.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, he had a long life.  No, he's 10.  But in doggy years!  They didn't make up that math.  They did make...  It's totally made up.  It's 10-7.  You just take the...  It's every year, seven years.  It is.  I think that is. 
[04:51:00]  Yeah.  That's what they say, but that's because dogs only live 12 years.  The pro-dog agenda of, like, they're intelligent, they understand when I'm upset.  No, they're just fucking useless animals.  Right.  They can't go outside without you.  If there's something salty that they can lick off your face, they'll do it.  Absolutely.  A hundred percent.  Absolutely.  I can't believe you're saying this and acting like this, because I know how you feel about  your cat.  I love animals.  And you attach all these human emotions to your cat, that when he would freak out, that  he was just getting overstimulated. 
[04:51:30]  Yeah, but guess what?  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  I know.  If the shit went down.  Right.  And there was a fight between me and that cat, I'm winning.  A hundred percent.  You know why?  Because of my limbs.  One quick boom.  I thought...  You know how many times I've thought about the reality of if I needed to kick it in the  jaw, I could break it?  Do you understand that cats are probably much trickier to fight?  Than a dog?  Sure.  They're agile.  They're sneaky.  I mean, a dog, you could literally lean in and punch in the face. 
[04:52:00]  And you'd be like...  You'd be like, dog, you want to fight?  You'd be like...  And then you just hit it.  Like, you're not punching a cat, but if you can get your leg in there, that's where  a human's got those long legs.  That's why a cat, you're looking to grab and throw.  Right.  That's scruff.  I know you're weak.  You're scruff.  I know the back of that neck.  I'll just whip you into a wall.  Now, I believe all animals should not be beaten.  Thank you, Sam.  I don't think you should...  Animal cruelty is different than fighting an animal for your life. 
[04:52:30]  For your life.  That's what we're talking about.  I'm talking about a real The Grey-like situation where a plane crashes.  Right.  And hypothetically...  Right.  ...dogs are surrounding me while I have my fists wrapped in little liquor bottles.  Right.  Which, by the way, The Grey was a shitty movie.  It was the worst ever.  I never saw it.  I never saw it either.  Let me tell you something.  I watched that movie because I was like, oh, this looks so badass.  That one scene in the trailer where he's got the bottles taped to his knuckles and he's  ready to fight a wolf.  That's the end of the movie.  Of course.  There are no fights with wolves in that movie. 
[04:53:00]  Not one.  Liam Neeson does not travel well.  No.  He just doesn't.  No.  Have you seen Liam Neeson on your plane?  Yeah.  Get off that plane.  I know you're probably freaked out to see me.  Wow.  That's good.  But we're flying.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Not Liam Neeson.  Ah, fuck.  Look who's on the plane.  Hey, everybody.  I know you're probably upset to see me on your plane.  Don't worry.  We're probably going to be all right.  And if we're not, I will talk very slowly until we are all right.  We do that perfectly.  Well, listen.  Everybody love your animals at home. 
[04:53:30]  We're running.  We're out of time.  That was it.  That was the show.  Wah, wah.  That was the show.  Can I have more cake?  No, Denny.  You can't have more cake.  Is that why you're in here?  Because there was a cake in here, Denny?  Of course.  You got it, baby.  Jesus.  You got it, baby.  You got it, baby.  Well, happy birthday to Sal.  Happy birthday, Sal.
