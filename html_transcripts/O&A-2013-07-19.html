<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a highly vulgar and rambling segment, filled with profanity and boasts about the show's outrageousness. This was followed by a crude rap song about the hosts.  The show then transitioned into a discussion about the summer heat, specifically the absurdity of heat safety advice for the elderly, leading to anecdotes about the hosts' varying levels of financial comfort and extravagant spending.  Jimmy Norton joined the show, recounting his financially irresponsible early life with a high credit limit, including purchases like a Sea-Doo, and discussing the predatory business model of CD clubs.  A significant portion of the show focused on Sam Roberts' absence due to his Comic-Con request being denied, with speculation on cost-cutting and misjudgment of listener reaction.  Norton then detailed his recent trip to Los Angeles, including appearances on Jay Leno, a surprisingly kind encounter with Anthony Hopkins, and an awkward meeting with Chris Hanson ("To Catch a Predator"). The segment concluded with discussions about sleep deprivation, with both hosts sharing anecdotes of falling asleep while driving and employing measures like self-slapping to stay awake.

The next segment delved into Norton's experiences as an air conditioning installer, featuring graphic descriptions of the physically demanding and unpleasant aspects of the job, including working in attics, dealing with difficult homeowners, and the numerous times he fell through ceilings.  He described using a spackle bucket as a makeshift toilet in his van.  Adam Carolla joined as a guest, and the conversation shifted to his comedy performances, a humorous encounter with Justin Bieber, and a ride with Jay Leno that unexpectedly involved meeting Norton's parents.  The show also included phone calls from Mike Tyson, discussing his one-man show and boxing promotion company, and Chuck Liddell, talking about his fighting career and Anderson Silva's UFC loss.  These calls were framed as birthday wishes for Norton.

The show then moved to a discussion about boxing, contrasting the excitement of older fighters like Mike Tyson with the perceived lack of excitement in modern boxing.  Carolla compared the shift to moving from hardcore to softcore porn.  The conversation broadened to critique modern media's sensationalism and the pursuit of outrage, using examples like the Trayvon Martin case and the Alec Baldwin voicemail incident.  This led to a discussion of societal hypocrisy, examining the Jody Arias trial and a teacher-student case, highlighting how perceptions and attractiveness influence public judgment. A significant portion focused on a humorous critique of a caller's poor-quality tattoos.  The segment included birthday wishes for Norton from Bill Burr (via song) and Bobo, along with a comedic back-and-forth with Bobo over past grievances. The celebration continued with cake and a visit from a female fan, concluding with a discussion of Carolla's podcast.

Jim Norton's birthday celebration continued with a "gorgeous" Dominican woman as a studio guest.  The conversation became sexually explicit, focusing on the guest's body, sexual preferences, and experiences.  The hosts and guest engaged in crude humor and offensive jokes.  Surprise calls from Bert Kreischer and others, including Bobo who engaged in explicit phone sex with the female guest, punctuated the segment.  Colin also called, with his calls interspersed with other conversations.  The segment included discussion about the female guest's arrest for throwing a beer bottle and George Zimmerman's gun. The show ended with the female guest briefly exposing her pasties and underwear, followed by further explicit commentary.

The final segment featured DJ Who Kid, focusing heavily on his online persona and Instagram activity featuring provocative photos of women.  The discussion included frequent use of racial slurs and sexually explicit language,  and revolved around Who Kid's various alter egos, including "Nigga Bond," "Nigga Spock," and "Nigga Spider-Man," and his interactions with women.  There was debate about the appropriateness of using racial slurs, with Who Kid expressing unconcern about potential backlash.  He detailed experiences with celebrities, including an email exchange with Leonard Nimoy.  The hosts and guest also discussed Who Kid's marriage, a recent wedding, and controversial DJ costumes.  A Dollar Shave Club advertisement was also aired.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Arby and Earth show.  What before has one radio show been so extreme?  Oh my god, I got it!  I got it!  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy!  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane. I mean, I mean, this is insane. 
[00:00:30]  So...  Fletulant.  Why do we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real.  That's the sex.  Tune in with no expectations.  Point simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we are.  Bill and Anthony's show.  Another four hours of love.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[00:01:00]  Woo!  Yeah, check, yeah, yeah, check it.  I'm up early in the morning, yawning.  Put Opie Anthony, yeah, Jimmy Tranny pawning.  Opie like brother man, ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy, on the other hand, he working the other hand.  Turned my headphones up!  They're horrible people, what they say in this show.  I'll give you a way to be, and I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene, but I'll give it a go.  Diffie said, Larry King, Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Go, go, I know you feelin' the flow, but Opie's motherfuckin', Jimmy's tryin' to get blown.  They would come to play around, and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothin' like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be, and don't worry about gettin' a shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah, on the edge of you, yeah.  Cause you really wanna hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  This is Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, trust us, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, sissy, yeah.  Now my guy's up in this pit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Booga booga, booga booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  What's plava?  Enough of this plaques.  It's like the very old man version of plava.  Yeah, yeah, plava. 
[00:02:30]  Well, good morning, everybody.  Hi there.  Friday edition, huh?  Nice.  That was a tidy little week in the can.  One week in the can.  Well, after this, anyway.  What fun.  Dealing with the heat, anybody?  Oh, boy, let me tell you.  Another scorcher here in the northeast.  The rest of the country's like, what?  I think it's hot all over, though. 
[00:03:00]  It's summer.  Yeah, it's summer.  You know?  Yeah.  And we had the shittiest beginning to a summer ever.  It was rainy and cold, and it wasn't summer-like at all.  And then you get three or four warm days strung together, and they're like, well, when is this  heat wave going to end?  I like that the news has come on, though, and reminded us.  Some things you may want to do is drink water.  Water.  Good.  Stay hydrated.  Maybe wear short pants.  Shorts. 
[00:03:30]  If you're feeling hot, get out of the sun.  Right.  If you can get into the shade, we recommend that.  Ah, let's see.  Check the elderly.  Yeah.  You got to check on those elderly.  They don't know what to do.  They've made it all these years.  Mm-hmm.  But they have no clue what to do in the heat, I guess.  How about, like, once they become the elderly?  Just make sure you buy them air conditioners.  Air conditioning for the elderly.  Yeah, why not?  That's a good charitable charity to get behind. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, because the news always says how, you know, what terrible shape they're in once  it gets hot.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I guess they can't afford it.  They need, like, family members, and usually family just goes, bah, to the elderly.  Bah!  Sweat it out.  They've lived their life.  It's time I lived mine.  Buy the grandma a fucking air conditioner, or I've had my eye on a nice TV.  Right.  They start thinking about childhood memories of all the times they couldn't have the AC  on when they were a kid.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:04:30]  It's like, well, guess what?  Mom!  Yeah.  Eh.  It is such a big thing, that fucking AC, like, going to people's houses sometimes,  it's like, is the AC on?  No.  We don't, uh, we don't, um, we don't use it unless, unless what?  It's fucking 95 degrees.  How much warmer does it have to be before you flip that on?  My dad used to be like that in our house when we were growing up, and now to this day,  when you're driving up to the house, like, if I'm going to dinner or something, you gotta  look at the windows, because if you see the windows open and you see the screens, it's 
[00:05:00]  90 degrees.  Why?  Why?  At that point, it's not even refreshing to open the windows, it's just sweltering out.  And, and, yeah, there's some, I don't know, you know, I guess, I guess when some people  say, Anthony, you're out of touch.  You're wonderful.  Hilarious, fucking great person.  Handsome.  Handsome.  But you're out of touch when it comes to financial matters, because you've been launched into 
[00:05:30]  a financial category that many have not attained.  Uh, so I run that AC like a motherfucker, like it's just a fan.  That's all.  Like, oh, turn the fan on.  Like, bad.  Six fucking zones of cranking refrigeration.  That's my house.  Of course I'll leave it on when I'm not home, then it will be cool when I get home.  As we speak, my house is a chilly 70 degrees.  In every room.  Rooms I haven't been in in months. 
[00:06:00]  They're all 70 degrees.  The house is comfort of 70 degrees.  When I wake up in the morning, my bedroom is very cool, because, you know, the door's  been shut and the AC's been on all night.  But then I open the door and walk out into the rest of the apartment.  Oh, boy.  Sweltering.  Yeah.  That makes it even worse.  Just lying down, like, with his stomach.  He's like, ah, I got a fur coat.  I can't even take it off.  This sucks.  Yeah, I mean, I'll have the AC on when I'm home in the room that I'm in if it's hot. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'm not.  I guess I'm not there either, where I'm leaving the AC on and keeping it a cool 70 degrees.  All around the house.  I like keeping it cool.  So I guess I can't really get that whole thing.  But I just don't understand, how much more is it?  Is it a lot of money to run that AC?  I don't know.  I mean, to the point where you just don't fucking use it?  No, but it can add up to the point where people might only have one air conditioner instead 
[00:07:00]  of two.  Right.  We have one in our living room.  We don't have one in our bedroom.  How the fuck do you do that?  Because when you live in an apartment so small, sometimes it's not that bad.  Oh, you leave the door open and the AC from one room creeps right into the other.  Yeah, but then sometimes when it's like 105, there's nothing you can do.  Like, we have fans in our bedroom.  Oh, do you try to redirect the air conditioning air into the room?  Do you bank it off the wall, a little fan through the door kind of a thing? 
[00:07:30]  Like, we're kind of in a different position than other people because we...  Doggy style?  Yeah.  Nice.  I see.  We live like a half block from the beach and we've got windows coming in on two sides.  So we get a really nice...  I'll talk about that out of touch.  I thought me.  Look at Mr. Beachfront fucking producer over here.  Well, on the beach house, you tend to get a nice breeze coming through the window.  You know, between hearing the crashing of the waves here at the beach and that nice, cool  breeze... 
[00:08:00]  Right.  And just the...  The...  Of the seagulls and various seabirds, we fall right to sleep at night.  Travis just walks around in his apartment in his Tommy Bahama shirt and shorts.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Like he's somebody.  Like he's somebody.  Very thin, flowing white fabric blowing through the windows.  Oh, yeah.  A little...  Yeah.  All linen curtains.  Yes.  Linen curtains.  Mm-hmm.  A rattan ceiling fan slowly spinning above the tiki part.  Is white and light blue.  Yes, yeah, of course.  It's wicker.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:08:30]  I could see it.  Because you don't spend much time in the apartment when you can just be out at the resort beach.  Right.  At his own personal beach.  Right, right.  Yeah, our hurricane-ravaged community.  Yes, hurricane-ravaged.  But, I mean, like, if I want to take a nap in the afternoon, I have to, like, mentally,  you know, prepare myself because it's...  For the heat.  Yeah, it's hot in there.  You know, I fucking...  I hate the cold.  But it costs a lot of money.  But that heat, I can't sleep in it.  I don't mind being out in it. 
[00:09:00]  It might cost less in other states.  I mean, we're dealing with Con Ed and LIPA, and they're not.  It's also, it's like a mental thing, though.  Like, when those AC is...  When you actually think about paying your bills, like Travis and I still do...  Oh, boy.  When the AC is on, it's just...  You just look.  It's like numbers.  Just ding, ding, ding.  You're imagining.  This bunk is going to be like $300.  Oh, you'll be conscious of it.  That sucks.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Because in the winter, like, the bill is going to be like $65, $70.  Yeah, yeah.  And then in July and August, it's like $325. 
[00:09:30]  Holy shit.  Can't afford that.  No.  Can't afford that.  Ain't nobody got time for that, for that.  When I was working for a living, as they say, I was never in a place that had air conditioning.  So I don't even know about, you know, flip the air conditioning on and then worry about the bill, because I never had it.  So by the time that you got air conditioning, money was no object, so it didn't matter.  Money, no object once I got AC, which thank God for that, because I would have kept it on and really gotten myself into some financial trouble. 
[00:10:00]  You would have been in debt because you're not responsible with your AC unit?  I was not responsible with anything financially, and if I did have air conditioning, it would have been a big trouble.  Jimmy Norton's back.  Hi, guys.  I'd have been in huge trouble.  We know how financially irresponsible you are from knowing what you bought with your credit cards.  A dinosaur.  Oh, you mean now?  No, no, no.  Back in the day.  I've gotten better, see?  No, you haven't.  You can just afford it now. 
[00:10:30]  I did.  When I finally got a credit card that had an $8,000 limit on it, I don't know why they sent me that.  The first thing I did was buy a Sea-Doo personal watercraft.  And I was trying to, I think for three days, I was like, I'm only going to use this for emergencies.  Everybody says that.  Only for emergencies.  I was like, I'll just buy concert tickets, and then I'll immediately pay it back.  Yeah, yeah, I'm going to pay it back, because fuck them, I'm not paying that interest.  Right.  That's like 25% interest on this credit card. 
[00:11:00]  I'm smarter than they are.  I'm smarter than they are.  Ten years later, I'm paying off that Pearl Jam concert for eight years ago.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I needed a Sea-Doo personal watercraft.  That was an emergency.  Right.  And a trailer.  And I needed a camcorder.  And I needed a new thing.  It was called a carousel CD player.  Whoa.  Not TVT, mind you.  CDs. 
[00:11:30]  Compact discs.  The new trend.  And then I had to get CDs.  To play in the CD player.  Because cassettes get the fuck out of town.  It's like three days after getting the credit card when you go, well, I mean, technically,  I have like $8,000 now to just use.  To use it.  And the interest, it's like, what is it?  Two, three, four percent?  That's nothing.  You know what I thought about interest back then?  What?  I was interested in getting the watercraft.  That's all I, even that's the only thought I ever gave it. 
[00:12:00]  You don't have the equation of like interest building on itself, on itself.  I couldn't fathom that stuff.  Or if I could, be bothered with it.  How could you think about it when the waves were crashing against you on your Sea-Doo?  When I was out there, the thought of interest or money or paying this back, never.  I was having too much fun.  Was it something you could afford?  No! 
[00:12:30]  And there were like a thousand things in front of that that I should have gotten.  Of course.  That I could have, like.  I love it.  It is the dumbest thing you could have bought at the time.  Probably the dumbest purchase ever.  But let me tell you.  You didn't have air conditioning.  When I was out on that open Long Island Sound, tearing it up, you know there's a little hatch in front?  Yeah.  I used to dump ice and some beers in there.  There you go.  And just fucking, every so often, I...  And it cracked that open. 
[00:13:00]  I'm chugging away beers, and then...  Living the good life.  And then the bills would come in, and I'm like,  I already got it.  What am I paying for something I already have?  It's in my fucking driveway.  It's the same thinking as those CD clubs,  where it would say, you pay a penny, you get 13 CDs.  Yeah.  And my friend used to call me and be like,  you've got to do this.  It's the greatest scam ever.  It's free CDs.  You go, what you do is you pick the 13 CDs, 
[00:13:30]  they send them to you,  and then you don't buy anything else.  I thought that's how that worked.  That's not a scam.  That's just you stealing.  That's just you saying, I'm not going to do it now.  Yeah, but we all did that.  Right, of course.  Everyone did it.  And there was always that little...  Even as a kid, you were a lawyer.  You knew it's like,  Dick can't hold me to a contract.  I'm a kid.  Yeah.  I know contractual law,  and I cannot be held responsible for a contract I signed to do. 
[00:14:00]  I am under a kid.  What, are they going to send my mom to jail for 12 white zombie CDs?  I don't think so.  I don't know what that was all about.  They had to know people weren't paying.  I personally don't know anybody that did pay.  No, because then the CDs were like $25.  You're like, why am I going to buy that CD?  Wouldn't they send you a CD of the month, too, if you didn't...  Because I used to get CDs.  I'm like, I didn't order this.  Yeah, yeah.  They sent you one automatically.  But you can return it.  You then had to return it.  If you didn't return it, which is what they were banking on,  they would then bill you like $25. 
[00:14:30]  But that was also back in the day where it was like,  we're just going to send you a bill.  Like, it wasn't like the internet where they would just take it out of your checking account.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because they'd send you a bill,  and then the deal was you'd just not pay the bill.  Yeah, you just don't pay the bill.  How the fuck did they have a business model where their end game was,  after you got all the free shit,  we're going to send you stuff that's really expensive and you have to pay it.  Like, it should be, pay for like five of these.  Pay for five of them at $25 a clip. 
[00:15:00]  And then we'll send you $13 for a penny.  You don't give it to them right off the bat and then they fucking just...  I think the best part was that there were two companies battling it out.  So I could get 12 CDs from BMG and then 12 from Columbia House.  Yeah, yeah.  And then my brother could do the same thing,  and then all of our friends could do the same thing.  Yep.  And we've got all of our music.  Yeah.  Do you know there was, before the compact disc and cassette tape,  there was Records.  What?  And they used to have this back in that day. 
[00:15:30]  And you would get this giant box of albums, full-size fucking albums.  I mean, just the shipping calls, you would think would put them out of business.  Thirteen albums is pretty heavy.  Put 13 albums together and lift it up.  You know, it's not like...  But it's a lot weightier than CDs.  And it's big, too.  It's 12 by 12 or whatever it is.  Yeah, yeah.  Big box or 8-tracks.  Send for records, albums, or 8-track cassette tapes.  Are they in business anymore?  I don't think they have that business model. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  It's, yeah, what a stupid thing.  I just never knew anyone that actually went through and paid.  How long into that do you think before they realized that they made a horrible movie?  Yeah.  Like, we've sent out 40,000.  How much back?  Nothing yet, but we're sure it's got anything.  Yeah, but the bills are in the mail, so...  Yeah, the bills are out there.  And we do have these pennies that people taped to the little fucking sheet they mailed back. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  The pennies.  We've made $470 in pennies here.  Okay.  Yeah.  Columbia House is still around.  It's a DVD club now.  And what do they do?  The thing is, I'm sure you have to sign up with a credit card or PayPal.  Join the Columbia House DVD club now and get three DVDs for $2.99 each, plus shipping and processing with membership.  Oh, boy.  To get started, sign up, blah, blah, blah.  This is with membership, which means they get your credit card information. 
[00:17:00]  Of course.  How much is processing?  $2.99 a piece, plus shipping and processing.  I hate that shipping and processing.  It's not handling anymore.  It's processing.  Processing.  And it's more than usually the product that you're buying, especially with those infomercials.  They're like, and we'll send you two.  Just pay separate shipping and processing.  And then it's like, wait a minute.  Now the shipping is more than I'm paying for this dumb fucking thing that I'm buying,  that you're forcing me to buy two of.  Right.  That's really what they've done.  Yeah.  How can it cost $30 to process a fishing lure? 
[00:17:30]  Order now and we'll send you a second one.  And you're like, no, what you're doing is making me buy two.  Yeah.  I don't need a twat mop.  It's like, you can mop your floor and your twat back to back.  Who needs that?  Shipping is $9 for three DVDs.  So I can get three DVDs for $18.  This is a great deal.  How are you going to do that?  Is that shipping and processing?  Yeah.  I'm saving $51.88 right now. 
[00:18:00]  Just amazing how much that is.  Yeah, imagine if people still used physical media.  Terms of membership.  Terms of membership.  Please pay.  That's a term we'd enjoy if you paid.  We expect you to pay.  They expected you to get a check or money order, fill it out, put it in the envelope and mail it back to them.  That's like...  I think they figured...  The credit or debit card you provide will be used for your introductory offer.  Yes.  All future charges.  Exactly. 
[00:18:30]  They figured it out.  I think they hoped that adults would see this in magazines and then get the bill and think,  oh boy, I better pay this.  I don't want this to come back on my credit score.  I don't want collection agencies.  What they didn't realize was kids would just pull the thing out, tape the penny on.  Yeah.  I had one friend who was like, I just put my mom's name on it and she doesn't live with us anymore.  There you go.  She's not liable for it.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Honey?  Honey, yes.  The Engelbert Humperdinck CDs have just come in. 
[00:19:00]  Could you get my checkbook so I can write the check to these fine people that sent it?  No.  It's fucking 13 going to a kid who's never going to pay.  They probably knew by the order whether they were going to get their money or not.  Yes.  Just jerky boys, one, two, three.  Oh, no.  They're like, all right, this is a fucking waste.  Send them out.  It was older people, maybe a Bee Gees, Engelbert Humperdinck.  Yeah, yeah.  They knew when they looked.  They're sending them out, gathering up the CDs and putting them in the box.  Oh, we'll never see this. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, if every single CD had a parental advisory sticker on it, they were never seeing it a dime before.  They were saying, shit.  Well, look, Jimmy Norton is back.  And it's, let me say it.  Can I say it?  Oh, yeah.  It's a big talk of the town.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you.  Happy a birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dearest Jimmy.  Thank you. 
[00:20:00]  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you.  I love the fact that Opie and fucking E-Rock are acting like they're not here today.  I know, right?  They're preparing for my bash.  Oh.  Oh.  He's on to them.  Yeah.  Where are you leaving?  I thought you were at Comic-Con.  Oh, what a surprise.  No, they, uh, I'm not going to Comic-Con.  Why?  Oh, no.  Because there's just a lot going on right now.  People thought it would be best.  Oh, people.  I'm essential to the show.  You're essential to the effort. 
[00:20:30]  Wait.  There's a lot going on?  Mm-hmm.  Where?  Here.  You know, with Montreal.  Oh, Montreal's coming up.  And that.  Yeah, but we're not in Montreal.  We're here.  Right.  Well, I mean, just the idea that, I guess they maybe thought I would have a tough time  handling going to San Diego and then Montreal.  When would you have gotten back?  Uh, Sunday.  What would have been hard about that?  Wait, wait, wait.  I don't get it.  I guess it's a lot of travel for a little boy.  I don't know.  Who told you that? 
[00:21:00]  That's what I'm hearing through the grapevine from when they went and talked to management.  Boy, didn't Entertainment Weekly, like, request you?  Didn't the?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, the people organizing what's going on at Comic-Con requested that I go to Comic-Con.  And their request was denied.  By the company?  Mm-hmm.  Because they didn't want to fly you out?  I would assume so.  There's a lot going on.  Yeah.  But what's going on that you couldn't go there?  Montreal.  I know Montreal, but that's a different week.  And then there was some talk. 
[00:21:30]  They were like, well, you want to go to the Gathering of the Juggalos for the show, right?  And I'm like, yeah, we'll go and get audio.  And they're like, well, I mean, you know, now that's kind of a lot of days.  Wait, wait, wait.  But it's for the show.  It's for the show.  It's for audio for the show.  It's for the show.  And I'm like, you know, as much as I talk myself up, I think you guys can swing it without  me for a few days, right?  Take two trips now and only pay for one later.  Exactly.  You take a trip now and the listeners pay with a good show today. 
[00:22:00]  Wait a minute.  But what are you going to have to do between now and Sunday that there's a lot going on?  Do you work on the weekends?  No, I tape my Sunday show.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not live?  No, it's not.  Oh, man.  You just fucking broke down the wall.  Sorry about that.  I wasn't expecting to see you because I said to Kenny, I said, we got a skeleton crew today,  Opie and Iraq and Sam are out.  No.  Yeah, no, no, no.  That was denied.  It was requested that I go to Comic-Con.  Wow.  To help out everything that's going on down there. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And then that was denied.  But who denied it?  I think Gary.  But didn't Gary bring it to you to begin with?  No.  The people organizing it brought it to me.  And then I'm like, okay, yeah, we just got to talk to Gary.  You know, it'd be fun.  Uh-huh.  And so, yeah, no, I only, as far as I know, I only talked to Rob and Gary about it.  And I think that's where it ended.  Maybe they talked to Blatter.  I don't know.  But, uh...  Wow.  Yeah, that was denied.  I know it was Jason Shibiru was the guy's name who was organizing it. 
[00:23:00]  Because Entertainment Weekly is doing Comic-Con coverage.  And instead of doing Comic-Con radio, they're just doing Entertainment Weekly.  But they wanted somebody, you know, who also did Comic-Con radio there to help, you know, facilitate relationships and all that.  And Entertainment Weekly said, yeah, we would want Sam to go.  And then, uh, Annabella, the talent booker, and Jason Shibiru were like, yeah, we'd like to have Sam as a host down there.  And to bring back stuff.  And he could do a special on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Oh, boy.  That was the idea. 
[00:23:30]  Like, come back and do like an hour special.  But didn't Entertainment Weekly, like, you really liked the idea of doing a morning show there.  And it would have been a good gig for you.  And they just thought your voice was...  Shitty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's...  But now they're requesting you to go and do something.  So maybe whatever they have going on, they're like, yeah, he was good.  Right.  Like, you know...  And then they realize, oh, well, the content that he brings outweighs his horrendous broadcasting voice.  Right, right.  But that was denied.  They shut you down. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're holding you back.  Yep.  That's terrible.  Yeah, that is kind of shitty.  That was denied.  Wow.  But luckily, I'm here to hold you guys up.  Well, that's good.  Thank God.  Yeah.  You can just say it.  You didn't want to take Jim's birthday off.  That's true, too.  I mean, the...  Like, yeah, like, Opie, what, he's got his fucking beach house and Iraq's got a thing in Florida.  Right.  We don't even know.  I know they're here.  I know they're here.  Yeah.  I thought I saw the officer.  I came in. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, boy.  He was hiding.  Keep their head down.  They're probably escorting this special guest up.  I'm getting my cake.  Iraq is supposed to stay ducked behind there, but I think I saw the top of a party hat pop up.  He's wearing a party hat.  Ooh, for a blowhole.  He's breaching.  Roland just texted me and said, they really wanted you there at Comic-Con.  Meaning the people at Comic-Con.  Yeah.  Not the...  Oh, not the people who run the channel.  Did you talk to them and go, look, this might be an opportunity for me to do something for them? 
[00:25:00]  I talked to them and I explained what it was.  I didn't, you know...  Yeah.  I didn't...  I wouldn't say I lobbied for it because, you know, what am I...  It's a lobby for everything.  But I explained, you know, I think it'd be cool.  Jim's cool with it because, you know...  Me and Sam usually go together.  Yeah.  And I had mentioned it this year.  I'm like, let's see if we can go to Comic-Con.  And then I think I had spoken to Gary before that.  And he said, we're not sure if you want...  You know, if you really want to go, but you got...  You're doing much. 
[00:25:30]  You're all you do.  And I was like, yeah, fine.  I don't care about going.  Because I really didn't.  And I forgot that I have a gig.  I couldn't go anywhere.  I have a fucking major gig tomorrow.  And I told him, I was like, you know...  I was like, until the opportunity came up where the Entertainment Weekly and the people doing Comic-Con radio were like,  Sam, we would like you to go.  At that point, it was like, okay, well now, if that's the scenario, then yeah, I think you'd be good to go.  Yeah, and Sam gave me a courtesy call or email and said, look, they're asking me to go.  Like, he didn't want me to think that he went and go, look, I want to go without you.  And I knew what it was.  Of course.  Go ahead. 
[00:26:00]  Have fun.  Now, isn't it working for SiriusXM?  Not only SiriusXM, but this channel.  I would have come back.  Yeah, yeah.  And we would have put it on one day for the after show or the Sunday show or something.  So why was it treated like you were going on a fucking little vacation?  I don't know.  I have no clue.  But this channel, but Entertainment Weekly is a channel that Scott, we didn't want them here,  but apparently he really wanted them.  His little baby, right?  So now they're requesting you to do something because obviously they didn't feel like their host could get away or whatever.  Well, there's a lot going on. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I mean, it would have been good for me.  It would have been good for the show.  Oh, you know, Entertainment Weekly would realize, oh, those ONA guys are pretty good and blah, blah, blah.  It would have been bad for nobody except someone with ears.  Yeah.  Right.  I mean, yeah.  I can't guarantee the content, but they're all looking, they're all looking for, you know, that crossover thing and the camaraderie of shows and whatnot.  Perfect example.  They shot you down for no real reason.  It was denied.  No real reason was given. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  It's like, hey, you know, there's a lot going on.  It's very vague.  Yeah.  Just that there's a lot going on because with Montreal and the gathering coming up, which is not even sort of guaranteed, you know, Comic-Con just really a third trip really makes it seem like a lot.  I don't know, you know.  Do you think there was anything that you wouldn't have been able to do for other things in the future, all the things that are going on, apparently?  Do you think there was something you would miss or shirk a bit of your responsibility of because of you going to Comic-Con? 
[00:27:30]  There's no fucking way.  It's never happened.  Right.  I went to WrestleMania and didn't shirk any responsibilities.  Yeah.  I would have woken up at three o'clock in the morning and called the show at six if that's, you know, West Coast time.  That's what you guys wanted.  I don't care.  So what do you think the reason was that you didn't go?  What do you think the real reason?  Honestly, this is my opinion.  Yeah.  I think they tend to have a poor gauge on what's going to get you guys upset. 
[00:28:00]  They're very worried about upsetting and I don't think they have a good gauge on what's going to get you guys.  So did they think that if you went, we would be like, oh man, why the fuck did you let Sam go?  As if you don't have a staff.  They really do have a poor gauge on what's going to get us upset.  I also think money played.  And that's the other ten.  I think money was the bigger one.  If they cared about what got us upset, we wouldn't be looking at these same four walls.  Well, it's their poor gauge of what gets us upset.  They don't care about what gets us upset. 
[00:28:30]  They're going, well, they'll have the smaller studio, but they'll be happy because Sam will be there.  Because Sam's there.  More people in the smaller studio.  Yeah, but I also definitely think the fact that money was an issue.  They don't want to spend money on the likes of a Sam Roberts.  I mean, it could have been a...  How much is Coach Airfare?  It's not that much.  It's not astronomical.  No, it's not a crazy amount.  It would have been whatever.  Coach Airfare, maybe 300 bucks.  Hotel room and some food.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh boy. 
[00:29:00]  I don't fucking believe it.  I mean, they had a hotel room booked and everything for me.  Like, they wanted me there.  When were you supposed to go?  I would have gone Wednesday, I guess.  Yesterday?  Yeah, Wednesday, I guess.  Maybe after the show or something.  Oh, well, that...  Okay, then no.  Yeah.  Two days without Sam.  Oh, see, I didn't know.  Because yesterday...  Oh, see.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's silly.  That is silly.  Yeah, it is a little silly.  It's a very silly thing.  Unbelievable. 
[00:29:30]  Jimmy's back.  I think we should probably...  Let's have warm breakfast today.  Sure, that would be nice.  That would be really nice to eat our breakfast.  Not fucking 20 minutes after it shows up.  And then we'll come back.  Because I want to hear...  You met Sir Anthony Hopkins.  I did.  And I want to...  Oh, how is he?  All that stuff.  And you did Leno.  Amy was there, too.  I want to hear about your little L.A. jaunt.  And it's Jimmy's birthday.  So stick around for birthday festivities.  No, I'll be back. 
[00:30:00]  Don't...  There's O.B.D. Rock coming up.  I know.  I know.  The guys are here.  Right.  Long Island Beach House.  Oh, sure.  And we will return.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Continues. 
[00:30:30]  Holy shit.  I love that.  That Jimmy and the bus thing is so goddamn good.  Yeah, it was a good piece of production, too.  Oh.  Oh, why wouldn't you play Sabbath for the Sabbath on any day?  Well, it's Jimmy's birthday, so...  I'd probably come back with Sabbath each time.  It's your day.  Okay.  I like my day.  Your day.  Yes, I do.  You were out in Los Angeles. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, I just did a Leno spot.  It was fun.  Oh, yeah.  Amy was on the show with me.  Yes.  And it was great to see Amy.  She was very funny.  Was she nervous?  No, I don't think so.  I mean, she might have been, but she handles it.  She's been doing so much lately.  Yeah, yeah.  She's done The View.  I mean, you know, Leno, I think she did Kimmel recently.  She's done everything.  She had a great little rapport with Jay and with Sir Anthony Hopkins, too, who was sitting  next to her.  It was kind of funny.  She comes out, and she says hi to Jay, and then she goes to take the seat, but I don't 
[00:31:30]  think Sir Anthony Hopkins knew he was supposed to move over.  No.  Why would he?  So it was kind of like, hey, Anthony Hopkins, fucking move your ass over to the couch.  Yeah.  I've got to sit here.  Amy's just like, hey.  It's so funny that Amy had to tell Anthony Hopkins to move over.  Yeah, to move.  Could you scoot down a little?  Could you scoot over, Sir Anthony Hopkins?  He's just a nice man.  He was nice to everybody who approached him.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Of course, that was my obsession, was I've got to get a photo with him.  Well, of course.  So Amy, I figured I could get.  Let me work on Hopkins.  And my manager is back there with me, and he walked in, and Jonathan goes, Anthony Hopkins  is here, and he's by himself.  So we walked out.  It was two dressing rooms away.  Sounds like you've got a hit out on him.  I know.  He's here, and he's by himself.  Yeah, I know.  It was like we were fucking here.  He's going to Louie's in the Bronx.  It's perfect for us.  You know, we could take the camera behind the toilet. 
[00:32:30]  Behind the toilet.  So we just walked in and knocked on his door, and I said, hey, he said, yes.  And it was that fucking, it was Anthony Hopkins.  Oh, man.  And I'm like, look, I'm doing a segment on the show before you.  Is it okay if we take it?  He's like, yeah.  It just couldn't have been fucking nicer.  That's pretty cool.  And we took the picture, and he had that suit on.  It looks like the suit at the end of the movie.  Of Silence of the Lambs?  Yeah, where he's going to eat Dr. Chilton, or whatever the guy's name is.  Of an old friend for dinner.  And then after my segment, when I finished, and he was walking out, he was very friendly. 
[00:33:00]  He shook my hand.  What a nice guy, man.  That's cool.  He's a biggie.  That's a big one.  And when you leave, there was always black cars, and they get a ride to the airport or  whatever.  Yeah.  And his truck was in front of my car, and he was pulled over, because there's always  people lined up outside by the street.  And Hopkins, I could see in his car, just signing things, talking to people.  What a nice guy.  Just a nice man.  Yeah, I was really, really happy to see that he was...  You know why?  Because he has nothing to prove. 
[00:33:30]  No.  There's not one person in Hollywood that doesn't fucking look up to Anthony Hopkins.  Yeah, yeah.  He has nothing to fucking be a dick about.  And he wasn't.  What a great guy.  Oh, that is cool.  So it was a lovely trip.  Oh, good.  A lovely trip.  We have a quick turnaround.  Back, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot going on.  So I think...  You know, you can't stay there, Jimmy.  We have a lot going on.  A lot going on.  Oh, I saw on the plane checking at the airport, I see a guy, and I'm like, I know he looks  familiar.  And he's handing his thing in, and they say, last name, please? 
[00:34:00]  He says, Hanson.  And it was our old pal fucking Chris Hanson.  Oh, Chris Hanson.  Yeah, Hanson.  And so I said hello to him, and he didn't recognize my face.  I'm like, Jim from the Opie and Anthony show, and he was very, you know, how are those  guys?  Wow.  But I realized what a fucking lousy conversationalist I am.  I'm terrible.  You couldn't spark one up?  No, but it's me.  It was like, he was a really nice dude.  So I was like, hey, man, have you been back on since we had that, you know, the guy who 
[00:34:30]  was the Opie and Anthony fan?  He goes, oh, yeah, that guy.  And then I'm just standing there.  Oh, no.  I'm like, I talk for a living.  Oh, no.  You couldn't come up with anything.  No.  I'm really bad at that with everybody.  What kind of lighting should I use for my special?  Oh, fucking dude.  Should I use smoke?  Dude, it's just, as we're walking through, I did ask, we were going through, you know,  the security together.  I'm like, why did they cancel you guys?  Because, like, you know, the show was great. 
[00:35:00]  I'm like, it was a public service.  He's like, oh, you know, we just thought we'd move on and do other things.  So I'm like, well, where are you now?  Like, what are you?  He's like, I'm on Dateline.  Like, he's still there.  Like, I didn't know.  Oh, Jimmy.  They didn't cancel the show.  It was a Dateline special.  Not only did you.  Dateline's still on.  I didn't know.  Not only were you a poor conversation, but you insulted him.  I didn't mean to.  Yeah, he's gone on to, like, catch, uh, uh.  Yeah, to catch, like, Nigerian fucking scammers.  Yeah, he caught Nigerian scanners.  He caught people that were scamming old ladies out of lotto tickets. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's a reporter for Dateline.  He doesn't just do catching pedophile.  They never got the heat that the Catch Predator did.  Right.  He said we just wanted to do other things.  He said we did 30 hours.  I was like, oh.  Let's take a seat here.  I felt so dumb.  Yeah.  And then he was walking, he's like, what, are you going up to the lounge?  Like, he was really trying to be a good guy, but he just knew that I was a fucking bumbling weasel.  Oh, you're going up to the lounge, so take it easy. 
[00:36:00]  And I'm like, yeah, I am, and I'm kind of walking behind him because he left before I did.  And then we just kind of fade away, and then I just peeled off and bought a New York Post, and I'm like, oh, just.  Oh, Jimmy.  The reason that he stopped doing that show is because people like you who think he's just the guy who catches pedophiles.  True.  He has kind of typecast himself there.  Yeah.  They don't realize.  In the eyes of Jimmy Norton.  He's been a Dateline reporter for some time now.  Why'd they cancel you guys?  It's not canceled.  I know, but why did I say that?  I don't know.  Dude, I do it every time. 
[00:36:30]  Even when I met Hopkins, I had nothing to say to him.  I'm like, I gave him, like, the hand over the back of the hand cup.  I'm like, it's.  Oh, wow.  I'm always extra respectful with guys like that.  Hey.  Yeah, it's an honor.  I always tell them it's an honor.  It's an honor to meet you.  It's an honor.  Why'd they cancel that movie?  They should do more.  Hey, why'd they?  How come you can't get work anymore?  Oh, you still are.  I'm sorry.  That Silence of the Lambs movie?  How come they stopped doing that?  Why'd you quit after Silence of the Lambs?  I don't know what to say to people. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, Jimmy, you're a shy boy.  I'm very, very bad at that.  But in here, it's very comfortable.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, how am I talking to you guys now so comfortably?  We're all having a conversation.  Because we're all pieces of shit.  Yeah.  And they're amazingly popular, important people.  And you don't have to disguise the fact that your point of reference to them  leaves you with literally zero outside information.  That's true.  Yeah, but at the same time, it's not something that you're expecting to do.  Like, you're going there to get a photo with him.  Yeah.  You know, like, you're not expecting a conversation.  And I've been in those situations, too, where you meet somebody out in the lobby to take 
[00:37:30]  a photo, and then they try to have a conversation with you, like, to be nice, and you don't  know what to say because you're not prepared.  I thought I was just going to take a photo with you.  Oh.  You know, and they're like, so, how you doing?  And I'm like, good.  So, let me try to put myself in that position.  Hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, get the fuck away from me.  Yeah.  We talk for a living, though.  You think I'd be good at it, like, just being conversational.  Yeah, because you didn't have to prepare for this.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you just talk. 
[00:38:00]  Why would I?  Right.  But you just come on, you just chat.  And this may be news to you, but you're actually also in entertainment?  Yeah.  Like, you're in the same business as they are.  It's really weird.  Like, I don't know what, I never know.  Like, you know, Mike Tyson, we've had on a few times, and I've seen him outside of here,  and I saw him at UFC, and he was very friendly.  Yeah.  Really nice.  And we had something to talk about.  Like, when I first saw him, I congratulated him on the HBO thing.  His son was with us, so he was a little subdued.  Uh-huh.  Thank you.  And then after we chatted a bit about the Anderson Silva fight, so there was a thing 
[00:38:30]  in that moment for us to talk about.  To chat about.  Yeah.  So I was comfortable talking about that, but I couldn't have gone anywhere beyond that.  You can't go any further.  So do you not box?  Are you trying to think of things that don't have anything to do with their career?  Like, you don't want to say, like, to Anthony Hopkins, like, so acting.  You know?  Are you trying to think of, like...  No, I didn't even think of acting.  It would have been nice, but I don't know what to fucking say to people. 
[00:39:00]  It's very hard.  You figure, like, everybody talks to Mike Tyson about boxing, so you want to talk about something  else, and then you can't think of something else.  No, but I would have talked about boxing or whatever.  I just don't...  I panic in those moments, and I've been on that end so many times.  Right.  I'm so ultra self-conscious now, because I know exactly how dismissive in my mind I am  over drivel.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  So you want to make that mark.  Like when they say, hey, I love your show, or whatever.  We listen every morning.  Hey, thanks.  Thank you.  It's always nice.  But when they're like, dude, you get me through my days. 
[00:39:30]  It's not making...  I mean something, but it's like, they could just as easily say, dude, sometimes I drink  decaf.  They're not making that jump beyond anybody else that, like, could come up and say the  same thing.  If somebody...  I guess somebody's got to talk about something a little more...  Not personal, but...  They have to share an experience of theirs.  Yeah.  I don't want to hear that, though.  But it's better than, like, when somebody goes, oh, yeah, Roland, huh? 
[00:40:00]  Is he really like that?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, let's say, what if somebody was to come up to you, Jimmy Norton, and talk about  the time they met, like, Ozzy or Sabbath?  And it was interesting, like, and not just a, hey, I saw, I shook Ozzy's hand, like he  hung out with Sabbath for a night.  Was that interesting?  I was in, okay, I was in a hotel, not this time, but last time, I'm downstairs, and I'm  buying, trying to buy some gum or something. 
[00:40:30]  And there's a guy...  Tell us all about that.  Yeah, I don't remember what flavor, believe it.  There's something white on the table.  Why didn't you whip out...  Is there really?  It should be on a fist.  There you go.  And there's this married couple there, and the guy starts talking to me about this Sabbath  thing that I videotaped.  So, of course, I chatted about it.  And he knew...  I forget what they said that indicated to me that they knew Sharon.  I don't remember what he said or what his wife said.  Oh, yeah, she's like, you know...  And so we talked about 10 minutes about that and Sharon and Ozzy. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  I never asked who they were, because I'm like, I may have met them and didn't know it.  So we had a...  There was something there to talk.  They knew what I was interested in, and they spoke about it, so I was happy to talk about  it.  See, that's the end.  That's why most people come up to me and go, guns!  Right.  Right.  Oh, okay.  I get you.  But you don't care.  No.  No.  But they think that they found something.  Better be a good goddamn gun story.  That's why it's so difficult.  Like, even though you couldn't think of anything, like, you've been on the other side, you know 
[00:41:30]  that whatever you say, they're not going to care about.  Unless you...  Sometimes if you ask a question, it gives them a response.  Like, even though Nick Cage wanted nothing to do with me, he did answer my question as  honestly as he could.  So if I had a good question to ask...  I could have asked, like, hey, how many times have you been on The Tonight Show?  I've been on this many times.  Jimmy, he answered because he was in a seat next to you.  He could not possibly go anywhere.  Oh, I know, but I mean, like, with Hopkins, I could have asked an acting question or a  movie...  Or something I wanted to know. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, your hair's a lot longer.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  And it wasn't Silence of the Lambs.  It was.  Is that for a role?  Yeah.  What do you just wear it like that?  Yeah, or, um...  What do you guys do?  Any more Silence of the Lambses?  Move.  Silence of the Lambses.  Will you wait a minute?  Ah.  Ah.  All right, I'll have a course.  Is that happy birthday?  That's it, the mash-ups.  Exactly.  That's probably where older you are.  You rock R.  They're prepping.  Mash-up that ass.  Yeah, they are.  I'll tell you that much.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuckin' mash-up that ass. 
[00:42:30]  She's lovely.  Nicole is lovely.  Yeah, yeah.  She's delightful.  She does have that look.  Yeah.  I'm very tired.  Are you sleepy today?  Yeah, I'm very sleepy.  I don't think it was any surprise for me to say I was very sleepy yesterday.  I was nodding out at the end of the show.  Literally.  There were like three times my nose hit the mic.  I went poof.  Just literally nodding out during the show.  I barely got any sleep yesterday.  And made it right up until the end.  And then just fucking.  I was like, what?  And then the drive home was just a nightmare of me yelling to myself, stay awake! 
[00:43:00]  Smack in my face trying to drive.  And then you'll go, stay awake!  Don't fall asleep!  Don't fall asleep!  Don't fall asleep!  What was I doing last night?  I think I had this.  I had this.  I'm almost hitting something!  Wait a minute.  What song do you sing to not fall asleep?  Don't fall asleep!  You're going to be okay!  You've stolen the Reservoir Dogs song.  Well, that was kind of stolen from any kiddie song. 
[00:43:30]  That's the first of my Cold Macaroni song.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  It's kind of like a.  You sing that?  You are a stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  And I smack my face.  I mean from fucking way out.  Bam!  I'd be happy to ride home with you.  What a great job that would be.  Offer that little.  When I start singing, slap my face.  Consider it done.  It's horrifying because there's really not much you can do about it if you're driving 
[00:44:00]  and you're falling asleep.  It's terrible.  Jess has been terrified because I've told her stories where I've had to do all that.  But then like it'll be so bad.  I'll get home safely and I'll pull into the garage and then I'm like I don't think I'm  going to walk upstairs right now and I'll put the seat back and I'm like let me just  take a nap right here.  Are you crazy?  And I just take a nap real quick.  Hopefully with the garage door down and the car running.  The house?  No, no, no, no, no.  In the apartment building I live in.  Like in the apartment garage.  Just pull the seat back and get myself 10 minutes before I get out of the car. 
[00:44:30]  Can you really sleep like that?  I envy you.  I can't do it.  Not like sleep sleep because I can't.  Or I've had to.  You're home.  I've pulled over at a gas station halfway between here and home.  Well, that's probably smart.  Yeah, let me get 10 minutes in.  I did that when we were coming home from the Camden virus tour.  Yeah.  I had to stop on the turnpike and sleep.  I was like there's no possible way I'm making another hour.  Right.  You should have done that because it was so fucking scary.  You just can't.  You know what happens too?  You're so awake at one point.  You're like, all right, I'm going to stay awake. 
[00:45:00]  I'm driving.  Everything's fine.  And then your brain goes into this thought mode where you just start, you know, like  you normally would.  You're driving, but you think about other things.  And then you realize that thought just turns into this abstract, almost dreamlike mindset  where your eyes shut.  Plus, you're asleep.  You're fucking asleep hurling down the highway with a fucking giant piece of steel.  And then the act of keeping yourself awake takes so much energy that you're like, oh, 
[00:45:30]  now you're exhausted.  You're all tired from all this yelling.  Fuck.  It's so bad.  Don't fall asleep.  Stay awake.  Don't fall asleep.  Why's that be a big hit song?  I'm going to stay awake.  I try to scare myself.  Yeah.  I just go like, and it never works because I always see it coming.  Because I just yell.  I go, what?  But you know.  But I always know it's coming.  I try though.  He tries to scare me.  Because I want to get that shock of adrenaline. 
[00:46:00]  So I'm like, oh, give me a couple minutes.  But I've never been able to scare myself.  But you know what else?  No matter how tired you are, you're never more awake than when you almost crash because  you're tired.  That few seconds that you wake up and go, holy shit.  And then you think to yourself, well, now I'm up.  There's no way.  I'm not even tired now.  And then four minutes later.  And then you're falling back asleep.  Like an asshole.  Can you imagine what the people are thinking watching Anthony in his car smack himself 
[00:46:30]  from about arm's length?  You know what I sometimes do?  If they're black, they're like, I wish that was me.  It's like Fight Club.  Yes.  I look at my face in the mirror and be like, okay, if I saw me right now, would I be scared?  And I'm looking and like one eye is half open and I'm like, yeah, it would be.  Like if I was in another car and saw me driving, I'd be like, oh, that guy should not.  So I try to scare myself.  I'll like sit up like proper with like 10 and 2 thinking that like if I'm sitting up and 
[00:47:00]  like posture is the secret.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Never works.  I had that recently where I dropped somebody off in New Jersey and coming home, I didn't  think I was going to make it.  And I'm never that tired.  Like my sleep is a disaster.  I loved it.  Like I was scared driving, I'm like, just get home and you will, I fucking crashed.  Oh yeah, immediately.  You will fall asleep within a second of laying down when you're falling asleep driving.  I was watching the guy on the plane last night next to me, like just watching people sleep.  Like I, I'm so envious of it. 
[00:47:30]  No, but I mean like how.  He's hovering over him and he's away from his face.  I'm a, I was watching and I watched how they do it.  Like I laid back and he puts his hands on his chest and falls asleep.  And I'm like, I can't understand what that's like.  Oh God.  I'm so jealous of that.  That's torturous.  It's awful.  What do you get the stay awake song stuck in your head?  Yeah.  You're not going to go to sleep.  Just look at this bald guy from England.  You're going to see the catch a predator guy dozing off. 
[00:48:00]  You're not.  Yeah.  It was, it's interesting to watch people fall asleep and how they, like people could fall  asleep sitting up and their head dips forward.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't know how people sit up in an airplane and put a pillow behind their head and fall  asleep.  I sleep on the subway every morning sitting up.  How do you, don't you have to hold your head up?  No, I just prop it back.  I can't sleep.  I get, I get one of the corner suits and I just fall asleep.  I get, I get, I get, I get be in bed and watch TV and like at some point I'm like,  all right, I got to go to sleep. 
[00:48:30]  And then I'll just roll over, put my head on the pillow and, and within, I swear to  you, within 60 seconds.  We're really lucky because there's people like, like, I know it's that just can't do  that.  Believe me, I think it's great.  I can never do it.  You couldn't just go like, ah, it's time to go to sleep.  Dude, I had a, it's like a cat.  I had a sleep study and even though you're all hooked up to everything and you got your  dumb wires on it, I, last one I took, I took a half an Ambien.  I've never taken one.  I've been sober for all these years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a doctor prescribed one.  I'm like, I have to sleep for this test to get medical results.  I can't be awake. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  And I took, an Ambien is supposed to knock you out for eight hours.  I took a half of one.  Four hours later, I was awake, gasping, and I could not go back to sleep.  Oh no.  A fucking half an Ambien didn't knock me out.  Oh Jimmy.  Fucking cocksucker.  You should have taken a full one then.  No, because then I was like, if it didn't work, I'd be too loopy.  I didn't want to get high off it.  I was scared of it.  And wouldn't the sleep study, wouldn't that kind of change the sleep study?  No, I don't think so because, you know, the same nonsense happens, I think, when  you're asleep.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  Oh, more of an apnea study than a... 
[00:49:30]  Oh yeah, it wasn't about how do I fall asleep.  All right, yeah.  That would have been very counterproductive.  Because that's kind of silly.  Yeah.  You take a sleeping pill for how you sleep.  No, this is just what happens once you're asleep.  And how does the machine respond to you?  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  I mean, just couldn't yap that being tired.  No, it's a big thing.  I guess a lot of people have that issue.  Yeah, if I didn't have this schedule, I would never be able to sleep.  I can't wake up.  Fuck going to sleep.  It's terrible.  It's so hard to fucking get up in the morning. 
[00:50:00]  I would love...  I like those weekends when I can just sleep until I'm like, get out of bed, you piece  of shit, you just lay in here like a lump, and then you get out of bed because you want  to, and you're disgusted with yourself.  Anytime I'm forced to get up for things, just get like I'm annoyed.  Oh.  It's fucking annoying.  And you can't sleep.  I can never sleep the night before, and I know I gotta get up, man.  It's terrible.  I'd be so glad I don't have the job that some of these fucking listeners have these physically... 
[00:50:30]  Like real jobs.  Yeah.  Well, maybe you'd be tired then at the end of the day and go to sleep.  Oh, sleep.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, nothing's, uh, nothing worse than those real jobs for getting your ass tired.  I was thinking about yesterday, air conditioning and heating working, because it's so hot, and  these were the days where everybody would be like, call the air conditioning company.  We need air conditioning.  It's hot.  Like, no one in the middle of winter goes, hey, let's get some air conditioning, and  then you're in an attic that isn't fucking blazing hot. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, this is so nice.  Yeah.  So it was always like just humping shit up into this hot insulation dust-filled attic.  You had some hot work days?  Oh, it was blazing hot.  Oh.  I don't know how people do that.  It was a real job.  And then everybody wants the, like, the grills that are on the ceiling.  When you put it in an air conditioning system, like, after the house is built, and it's been  there for years, like, you gotta, you gotta put the air conditioning grills in the ceiling 
[00:51:30]  and stuff, and, and they always want them very close to the walls.  You don't want one in the middle of your ceiling, you know?  You want it kind of hidden against the wall over a window in a corner or something like  that.  And it sounds all well and fine until you realize up in the attic where they want it  is where the roof thing is.  So there's, there's, like, this angle of the roof, and you only have, like, four inches  to work with, and there's roofing nails poking through, so it hits you in the head.  But it's cool up there, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a good 20 degrees cooler than the outside air. 
[00:52:00]  Imagine getting poked with hot roofing needles.  That's what it was.  While you were trying to work.  In the head, blazing hot, trying to saw a hole in the ceiling from the attic down into  the, into the ceiling.  Now, wait a minute, would you get, would you ever have, oh, would the dust just go on the  floor down there, or no?  Yeah, you'd have to, like, put down drop cloths so the dust would be caught, and then you'd  have a homeowner constantly bitching, like, is, are you gonna get that?  Like, clean it up? 
[00:52:30]  No, I'm just gonna leave it all over.  At the end, you gotta clean up and fuckin' vacuum.  Wait a minute, so, so you would, you would install central air conditioning?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You didn't do all that shit.  Yeah, it was central air conditioning.  You'd go in and cut a big hole for the big 24 by 24 return, and then you'd have to hump  all the equipment up through there.  Like, the giant blower units have to get into the attic.  You did it by yourself?  No, no, I'd have, like, two, at least two other people with me.  Were they, were they ever, was it ever awkward positioning and stuff?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  With the attic crowded with shit?  There were plenty of times where, you know, fuckin' ass in your face, and you're just  laying down on your back in insulation.  Hot and sweaty, it's sticking to you.  And then you try to wear the mask so you don't have to breathe it in, but you're sweating  so bad that you wind up being waterboarded with your own sweat, because it's like, fuckin',  the mask gets soaked.  Did your bag and ass ever get fuckin' sopping wet?  Terribly.  Terrible.  Sweating.  And just, it was, it was an awful job. 
[00:53:30]  And these were long days.  Yeah, it was an awful, like, yeah, you have to, it'd be like, it's a one day, in and out.  You gotta, when you show up in the morning, when you leave, they better be able to turn  on air conditioning and be done.  So you couldn't just be like, eh, I'll finish tomorrow.  So you had to get it done.  I couldn't dilly-dally like I do on some of those other jobs.  Were there any times where you just couldn't get it done?  Very rare, but yeah, there was something would go wrong, or, yeah.  So what do you do?  You hump, you have a bear house. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Because I'm so un-fuckin'-mechanical, I feel like these things just magically happen.  Yeah, I think it's magic men do it.  Literally, I couldn't be more impressed if you said, I just clapped my hands, and then  they hit a switch.  It's amazing to me that you can do that.  You and some guys hump this up.  The first thing you gotta do when you get there is go up in the attic and look and make  sure you have a pathway to get this job.  Right.  You look in the attic.  It's, uh, the blower unit itself probably weighs about 80 pounds, I guess. 
[00:54:30]  And then the compressor unit's really heavy.  What's the difference?  That's the one that goes outside.  That's the little fan unit that goes outside on the side of your house, and then the other  unit is the one that goes in your attic, and that's the one that blows all the cold air  through big duct work, and then it branches off into smaller ones, and into smaller ones,  and then goes to each grill.  So the heaviest thing is the, uh, the outside unit.  Yeah, but that's outside, so it's not too bad.  How do you connect that to the inside unit in the attic?  Yeah, that's a bitch.  You gotta fuckin' take copper tube, copper tubing that you gotta slide insulation on. 
[00:55:00]  There's two lines, one little one and one a bigger one.  And then you gotta tape it together, and then you gotta snake it through a hole that  you drilled, get it up through the wall.  It's such a pain in the ass!  But how do you have two guys doing it?  Yeah, and then one guy's gotta go,  Ah, give me some push!  Alright, hold up, hold up, hold up!  And then you're twisting and yelling, and it's such a pain in the ass!  Is that the worst part of the job? 
[00:55:30]  No, everything's the worst part.  No, the worst part is dealing with, like, insulation, flex duct work, which is like  this accordion-like tubing that's covered with insulation, and you gotta cut it to length,  and it's shards of glass that are coming out at you and going into your skin, the insulation.  It's terrible.  So you cut the, so the first thing you do is you get up there and you put this thing  in the attic?  You put all the shit up in the attic, you gotta get all your shit up there, all the equipment  up there, and then you find out the best place to put it, to put the blower unit, and 
[00:56:00]  then you gotta put all the stuff that goes with it, the condensation pan, because, you  know, sometimes these units leak, and you don't want it leaking through the ceiling,  so it sits on a giant pan with a hole in it, and the tube comes out of there and runs  outside your house, so if it starts leaking, it won't leak.  What if it's an unfinished attic, meaning, like, what if there's no, we had some boards  laid down to crawl on?  Oh, they're all unfinished.  So, I mean, like, you have to crawl over these wood slats?  You're, you're, you're torturing yourself, but your knees are on the two-by-six beams 
[00:56:30]  up in the attic, the joists, so you're kneeling on them, and they're digging into your kneecaps,  and you gotta drag this thing across the top.  And you're dragging it without stepping through the fucking ceiling.  Oh, my God.  We had a couple of helpers, it happened, like, three or four times in my career, that fell  right through the ceiling.  The homeowner's, like, sitting there, and this fat dummy falls right through into the  living room.  It was classic.  Oh, no. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  And then it's like, all right, the homeowner's, like, freak, and we're like, don't worry, we  got a carpenter that come in, and they'll take care of everything, and they have to,  you know, cut the big chunk that's busted up, put a new piece of sheetrock up.  Sometimes it works out good.  We actually, we actually had a homeowner that wanted two returns put in that were really  small, and they kind of, you couldn't really get the equipment up easily through it, so  we made, we made like the guy fell through the ceiling, just so we could cut a big chunk 
[00:57:30]  out and get the equipment up through it.  It's like, don't worry, we'll fix it.  Did you fix it, or someone else did?  The company, the air conditioning company has, like, a carpenter on call, so they're  like, hey, go over there and fix their fucking ceiling.  So once you get this thing up there, and all the equipment's upstairs, do you then connect  the copper tubing, then you do the snake thing to connect the outside to the inside?  Yeah, the outside to the inside's got to be connected.  How do you make the air go to rooms?  Well, no, that's just, that's just for the refrigerant. 
[00:58:00]  So the refrigerant goes through the outside one, and it compresses it down, and it gets  really cold and shit, and then it ships it up into the unit, and then it goes through  a thing and cools the air.  Right.  Then to get it into the rooms, that's a whole different thing.  That's the ductwork that goes on the front of the unit, the blower, and then you've got  to cut holes in the ductworks and branch out to each room.  So wait a minute.  It's a pain in the ass.  Oh, okay, so there's like a giant, say, silver-colored piece of fucking metal that stays in the 
[00:58:30]  attic.  Yep.  It stays up there with a bunch of, like, octopus tentacles over different rooms.  That run to the different rooms, and that attaches to the little box that's in the attic, and  then on the underside and the ceiling of the room goes to one of those grills that you see  right there and there.  Right, okay.  And the cold air blows out, like magic.  It's like a giant pecker with a bunch of spaghettis on it.  Or that.  That's how they do that.  I thought you literally had to go down into each wall. 
[00:59:00]  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Sometimes you do.  Some homeowners want it in the walls, and that's much more of a pain in the ass.  As opposed to where?  As opposed to in the ceiling.  They want it on the wall.  So you've got to find, you know, in between the beams and cut out a piece of the wall and  put this oval kind of duct in there.  And it's not fun work.  How long would it take you to do an average house?  A full day.  Okay.  Probably, yeah, over eight, maybe ten hours.  Wow.  Ten hours, yeah.  It's just, it's real work. 
[00:59:30]  It sucked.  I never wanted to do it.  I always wanted to get out of it somehow and figure out a way to get out of doing that  for the rest of my life.  So how would, how would, so the air works that night?  Does it take a day or two to get going?  Or does it just work?  No, it didn't work.  You flip this, hopefully, you flip the switch on the thermostat and cold air comes out.  And you go, ooh, yay.  It works.  Did you ever have it where you, you did that and nothing happened?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  How disappointed were they?  Can you think of a worse thing than guys in your house all day?  All day.  And, and, and when you want that cool air, just, get ready, here it comes.  The unit's no good.  Click.  Nothing.  Your mother's cunt.  Then you've got to start troubleshooting.  Would you do it right there?  Or the next day?  Yeah, yeah.  I was mostly installation.  So that was left to the other guy that would usually do the refrigerant and electronics, 
[01:00:30]  the thermostat and stuff.  But if it was a mechanical problem, like, you know, air is blowing out into the attic  through a hole in the duct that wasn't taken care of, then I'd have to get up there.  But for the most part, it was...  A hole in the duct that you didn't take care of.  Like, you know, one of the helpers didn't screw something in and one of the things blew  off the duct and, yeah, something like that.  But if it was an electrical problem or something like that, the electrician would deal with 
[01:01:00]  it.  So, but you're the one that brought that tubing.  You brought the duct tubing.  Yeah.  Oh, okay, okay.  Nothing worse, though, than turning it on, though.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Like, oh, boy.  The whole motor's sitting there getting all ready.  It's got a glass of iced tea.  It's just looking at the thermostat, looking at you.  And all he wants to know is, can you fix this now?  Now!  I'll tolerate it, but can you do it now?  So you put that little unit in the wall.  I don't know why I thought houses were just built with little units.  The thermostat.  Yeah, yeah.  You put the thermostat in the wall.  But then how do you get the fucking wires up to the machine? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, you got to drill a hole in the plate up in the attic, and then you snake the wire  down, and then you drill a hole where you want the thermostat, and then you put a little  wire in there and grab the wire and pull it through the hole, and then you attach  it to the thermostat and screw it to the wall.  What's the best part where you knew, like, we're home free?  That was pretty good, the thermostat part.  Wouldn't you test it before you put it in the wall?  No.  No, you just fucking hook it up.  Let it rip.  But yeah, it was...  That part...  Yeah, when you started knowing, you know, you're cleaning up, it was pretty good. 
[01:02:00]  The guy's falling through the ceiling makes me laugh.  Oh, the guy's falling through the ceiling.  And it was great if you would see it happen, because you'd be downstairs, and you'd hear  like this, boom, boom, and then you'd just see one leg, boom!  Like, a leg would be sticking out of the ceiling of the living room.  It's the fucking leg.  Did anyone ever fall all the way through, or no?  Yeah, yeah, we've had people fall completely through.  It's almost harder, though, to fall all the way through, because the joists aren't very,  like, close together. 
[01:02:30]  Or far apart.  Yeah.  They're pretty close together, so it's not that bad.  They would always catch themselves or something, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's fucking funny, man.  What the fuck?  Can you do that for a living?  Like, no way, no.  I mean, I couldn't be, I was a stock boy at a furniture store, so I had to unload a truck  for a while.  Yeah.  And even that, like, one summer of that, and it was enough.  Yeah, it's just...  And that was, I mean, I was in a big garage, and I was unloading stuff.  You know, I was lifting stuff, but it wasn't being cramped up in an attic. 
[01:03:00]  Like, we were watching guys roofing last weekend at some, like, shopping center, and it was,  like, 100 degrees outside, and they were, you know, putting down the roof slates and,  like, up on top of the...  I was like, oh, that's got to be horrible.  Yeah, we did that, too, where it was in commercial jobs, like big buildings, commercial work.  You'd be on the rooftop, and you'd have to cut a giant hole, like six foot by six foot  hole in the roof.  Would you ever get thirsty? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, I was always thirsty.  You just wanted a glass of water?  I've weeped ever in one of those hot acts, and you had to take, and I drank too much last  night's shit.  Every night, or every day, I'd be in there.  Every day.  You'd have to shit.  Would you pass gas up there?  And the homeowner doesn't want you shitting in their fucking...  They don't want you drinking out of their fucking glasses or anything.  They don't want you shitting in their house?  They don't want you shitting in their toilet.  You are the scourge of society. 
[01:04:00]  Hence the spackle bucket.  You'd have to shit in like a spackle bucket like an animal.  Where?  Sometimes in your work van.  You'd go in the van and shit in the bucket?  In the back of the work van, and just shit in a spackle bucket.  But not like in their attic.  No, no, no.  Why would you just tell them I gotta use your restroom?  The company did not want you using their restrooms.  They'd miss either?  They'd prefer...  To piss, yeah.  But the company wanted you to, like animals, go into the back of the van and shit in a spackle bucket? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I'd have to throw like all the tools and equipment to one side so there'd be enough room to pop the spackle bucket in, shut the van doors, and just reek out the van.  Would there be toilet paper in the van?  Yeah, yeah, you'd usually keep some toilet paper.  Would everyone shit in the same bucket?  No, no, you'd get your own personal bucket.  I don't know why our air conditioning's not done yet.  He's been in the van for 20 minutes.  Yeah, what's he doing in there? 
[01:05:00]  Would it stay in the van?  Then you'd have to drive home?  Horrible.  Would you have to tell your co-workers I'm going to drop a deuce in the van?  Well, you wouldn't drop one right before you left.  And you'd open the doors up and let it air out, but still, it's just...  Where would you leave the bucket until you went home?  Well, you'd have to seal the bucket up and leave it, you know, either outside the van or...  So now would one guy take all three buckets off, or would you each carry your own shit bucket, like your little A on a bucket of duty?  You would just have the buckets in the truck, and then you'd throw them away. 
[01:05:30]  A spack of buckets are a dime a dozen.  So people would be walking by in these neighborhoods, and there would just be a bucket of shit just sitting outside?  You wouldn't know.  You know, when you see a work van near your house, someone could be shitting in it right then and there.  Give a little knock.  That's all I'm going to think about now.  I know, that someone's taking a big dump.  If this van's a-rockin', I'm taking a shit.  I'm taking a dump.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The commercial jobs are worse, because there's just a bunch of animals.  Yeah, you'd have to cut, like, where the people downstairs would look up and see a giant hole in their roof. 
[01:06:00]  Just a big hole in the roof.  So then you really had to get the thing taken care of, because if it rained, you know, your fucking...  The water's going to pour in their building.  So what went over the roof hole?  It was something called a curb.  It was what the unit, the giant units, they would bring cranes in and have to land the units on these things.  But you'd have to put the base, the platform that these big air conditioning units sat on.  And you'd put it on the roof, and then you had to tar it in.  So you had to sit there with tar and tar paper and shit and smear tar so it wouldn't leak when it rained. 
[01:06:30]  And believe me, one, like, a marble-sized bit of tar would spread over you like it was a gallon.  That shit will be everywhere.  It's murder.  So when you do the tarring, you guys get there, obviously, before the unit arrives.  Yeah, yeah.  How many days does it take to do that process? 
[01:07:00]  That's probably a couple of days, but once you put a hole in the roof, you've got to make sure it's weathered tight before you leave.  So the base goes over...  The base goes over the hole, you screw it down on the roof, and then you start waterproofing with tar.  And the base has something in it that the unit can go on top of.  Yeah, it's just like a base, a square base, that the unit then, they bring a big crane and lift it up and...  So how come it wouldn't fall through the hole in the roof?  Oh, is it straddling the hole?  Yeah, it's straddling the base that you put on. 
[01:07:30]  You put it like it's a base made just for that unit.  And when you're doing a commercial...  When you're doing a commercial job, there's nobody like a homeowner or something to say,  can I get you a glass of water?  No, you've got to fucking bring your own shit.  And your own buckets to shit in.  Yeah.  But then the...  Oh, what a joy when the coffee truck shows up.  So that's where you get your lunch and everything.  The fucking...  The roach coach, they'd call it. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, you're telling me you go down there, you get more roaches and coffee.  Get you a cup of coffee, all the trades out there by the truck just talking to each other.  Right.  It was not my life.  I hated it.  I didn't want to hear about the carpenter and his fucking kids and his new car and his wife giving him shit.  Everybody there was regular Joe.  They were real regular Joes.  Would you ever have a day where you were in this fucking hot attic or on this fucking cocksucker roof  and then go home and your wife was cunty? 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  Yes.  All the time.  That bitch.  You'd have tar on your pants.  Yes.  That's what I needed.  Her being fucking cunty to me.  Covered in tar.  What the fuck?  Take out the garbage.  Oh, sorry, dear.  I was just being fucking assaulted in an attic.  You'd have to go home and do chores? 
[01:09:00]  Chores.  Oh.  Yeah, I had a few chores to do.  Clean out the cat box.  I'm not the one that wanted four cats, you cunt.  Did you ever say that?  No.  Yes, dear.  Where's the scooper?  That was me.  Yes, dear.  Where's the scooper?  You were a duty scooper?  I was a duty scooper and garbage taker-outer.  Spending the day in attics and on roofs, and then you'd go home and bend over and scoop  kitty litter?  Scoop cat shit out of a box.  What a horrible life you had. 
[01:09:30]  It was an awful little fucking existence.  Opie really saved you from a life of fucking just terrible shit.  Oh, I was doing, like, some shit for the morning show at one point, for the morning show at  BAB.  So I'd go in for, like, an hour before I even had to go to work.  And then I would go to work, and I'd be in an attic and shit, and it was awful, and I'd  be yelling and getting cut and shit.  And then I'd have the radio on, and I'd hear, like, one of my bits is on the radio.  And I'm like, how does this, like, it didn't seem possible to me. 
[01:10:00]  If I'm on the radio, I must be rich and famous.  You didn't understand, like, show business.  I'm in show business.  Why, why am I still doing this?  And then I got the big call, you know.  The big call.  I got called up to the big leagues of radio, and I was a good boy.  I gave my two weeks notice.  Oh, you did.  Like a good worker.  But this whole life explains why now you're so unapologetic.  Yeah, I am.  About being stinking rich. 
[01:10:30]  I could give a fuck if anybody has a problem with what I do.  Yeah.  With my cash.  A lot of people who don't know you don't know that Anthony really, this is what came from  fucking nothing.  It was terrible.  Terrible.  I fucking, I finally, I gave my two weeks notice.  I was working at, what was that?  Yeah, no, I mean, the last job I did for Apollo was at a hospital in Smithtown.  It was St. John's or something like that.  And I gave my two weeks notice, and that lasted three days. 
[01:11:00]  Three days in, I was doing something, and I went to screw something in, and I cut my hand,  and I just, I looked at it, I fucking grabbed my hand, I grabbed what I was screwing in,  I threw it on the floor, I went, that's it!  Take it easy, everybody!  You left in the middle of the job?  In the middle of the job.  I fucking walked.  I said, I'm done.  What am I trying to be noble?  And give two weeks notice so they could find some other skilled, intelligent man to replace 
[01:11:30]  me?  Stop.  Go to any fucking bus stop, you'll find somebody that can replace me.  But that's the fantasy of every guy that has that job.  Take this job and shove it.  Is that the greatest feeling that there ever has been?  It was amazing.  I threw that thing down, I walked off the job knowing that I was going to a radio job.  Full-time radio in Boston.  Like, that was it.  Done.  So you guys were going to Boston when you quit? 
[01:12:00]  Like, you weren't just, like, joining Opie in Long Island.  This was the big break.  We have our show in Boston signed.  We have it, we have a start date, I gave my two weeks notice.  You were working, doing AC.  Even when I knew I had a radio gig.  The whole time you were with Opie doing radio in Long Island.  Oh yeah, I was working.  You were also.  Oh yes.  Wow.  I was working air conditioning.  So it wasn't like when you just started a little bit, like you hear a bit.  Now, you were on the radio, slash, installing air conditioning units. 
[01:12:30]  I had to pay the bills.  Wow.  I had to pay for that jet ski.  Yeah.  I had a Sea-Doo to pay for it.  I had a Sea-Doo personal watercraft to pay for it.  How bummed were you when you got fired from radio with that first firing?  All I thought was, I'm going to be back in an attic, cutting fucking air conditioning ducts,  looking at the, like, my partner or something there, and going like,  you know, I used to do radio.  I was, you ever hear of the Opie and Anthony show?  WAF? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, that was me.  Yeah, yeah.  Pass me, pass me the eight inch flex duct and the duct tape, please.  Oh yeah, it was fun.  It was great.  You were dreading that?  I thought there was no other thing.  I'm going to be going back to sheet metal.  How long were you guys laid out, like, out of work for?  From April Fools.  Right.  April Fools.  Yes, I did a prank like that once.  No, you didn't.  I did, I said, the mayor left his hat in Arby's. 
[01:13:30]  Apple Fools.  Just get in trouble.  Yes.  Oh.  The mayor left his hat in Arby's.  What a scandal.  Yeah, a big scandal.  So, uh, we, so then we, we, we, we had a gig by, shit, when the fuck was it?  I, I wasn't very long.  No.  It was only a couple of months.  Oh, a couple of months.  Yeah.  So you had some time where you were panicking. 
[01:14:00]  Right away I was panicking.  Opie kept saying, he goes, don't worry, we'll fucking get another gig.  It's not even an issue.  And you were like, what the fuck did you do to us?  I'm like, oh my God, we're so fucked.  Yeah.  We're so fucked.  Oh my God, I got to buy new tools.  I got to buy new sheet metal tools.  I threw mine out on 95 driving up to Boston.  Did you?  Yes.  Right out on the side of the fucking road.  You might still be able to find them.  I did.  I just took them and went, flang, clang, clang, clang. 
[01:14:30]  You're such a theatrical guy.  He really is.  It was very cathartic.  You have to quit in the middle of the job.  You have to throw your tools out the window.  I did.  I bet you fucking dummy thought that's how the fucking movie credits would roll.  Of course.  With the shot of the van driving the Scooby-Doo van while his tools fucking still clang.  Clang, clang.  Yes.  Roll credits.  You know why?  You got to back up down the highway and pick him up again.  Pick him up.  Fuck.  Got fired.  He was...  How embarrassing.  Picturing the opening to his fish out of water sitcom.  Yes. 
[01:15:00]  That would be a good sitcom, though.  A radio guy now redoing...  Oh, God.  Where do you go with that sitcom?  Yeah.  Where does it go from there?  After episode one, he hangs himself.  He hangs himself in the pilot.  I would have...  Oh, my God.  I don't know what I would have done.  Oh, my God.  And considering the fact I was still with the wife, so...  I wouldn't have...  Yeah.  You'd have kids by now.  Can you imagine if you had a baby by now?  And fucking working back at Apollo. 
[01:15:30]  So, what happened there?  I missed a show biz.  They would have all goofed on me.  All the time.  Hey.  They'd play your bits.  When you walked in the room, they'd play one of your bits.  Remember this?  Imagine if you knocked her up, and in that first month that you were off the radio, she  made you quit to take care of the baby.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I couldn't.  And then Opie couldn't even look anymore with you because you were simply out of it.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Imagine if that fucking big horse dick had been pumping fucking anything but blanks. 
[01:16:00]  I was fucking pulling that out.  Oh, Jimmy.  That wasn't me.  That wasn't me.  It was a birthday one.  That was me pushing out the years.  A birthday toot.  Speaking of...  Yeah, we'll take a break.  Adam Carolla's coming in for the first time on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  So, we'll take a break, and hopefully he'll be here, and we'll come back with Adam Carolla  after the halls.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:16:30]  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Oh.  Get up.  Oh.  Oh, a little kiss.  Oh.  Get down.  How are we doing? 
[01:17:00]  This song just makes me feel like I'm fucking eight years old.  Yeah?  Like, it feels like someone's dicking you in the ass?  No, that could be 25.  With Adam.  Adam Carolla is here.  We've never had on the show before.  Matthew's coming in.  Here we go.  Adam.  There he is.  How you doing, man?  Pleasure.  Good to see you.  Good to see you, brother.  Take a seat right over there.  Pull up a mic. 
[01:17:30]  Why not, huh?  Oh, my God.  L.A. time, huh?  Yeah.  Well, then I did Artie's show.  I did Caroline's last night.  Right.  And then I went straight to Artie's show.  Oh, man.  You're exhausted.  And we left L.A., you know, got picked up at 5.30, so it was one of those.  How was Artie?  Crazy.  Artie's great.  Yeah.  Artie's always.  Oh, yeah.  He's a person, man.  I mean, he just always brings it, you know.  I'm seeing him tonight.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing a gig tomorrow in Pennsylvania with Amy and Dave Attell, so I'm fucking going 
[01:18:00]  on, and, you know, we're plugging together tonight.  Yeah, Dave's coming.  I think Dave's doing what?  Doing Caroline's tonight?  Or maybe tomorrow night.  Oh, you just do one?  What, do you get in and out one night for a club?  No, I do.  We do live podcasts.  We do, like, five shows.  Like, we'll do Caroline's two tonight, two tomorrow.  But if I'm doing stand-up, normally I'll just do a theater and get by with that.  But if I'm doing the podcast, it's, like, do a club. 
[01:18:30]  Uh-huh.  Do, like, multiple shows.  Last time, I think, I might have seen you once since then, but the last time was we  did the Live Caroline's podcast, and Justin Bieber walked out halfway through the show.  Oh, yeah.  That was cool.  And it was a fun show, too, but I'm such a pig, I think I might have bothered him.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know what he was doing there.  I don't know what he's doing, period.  It's pretty funny to watch the self-destruction of a teen idol.  Well, also, like, these guys start picking up tattoos.  Yeah, yeah.  They pick them up pretty quick. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  And so you're 19, so, like, at 26, you're going to be completely covered.  You're going to have no room.  Yeah.  No room for any more life experiences to put on your body.  Right.  Yeah, very odd.  Either that or he will just stop doing it.  It's really, it's embarrassing, because he's going through this, you know, 18, 19, we're  all kind of jizz buckets, and just to watch him humiliating himself, and it's like, it  probably is something nobody would want filmed by the whole fucking crowd.  I was kind of a jizz boat-a-back. 
[01:19:30]  I wasn't, you had to squeeze me a little bit.  Not a full bucket.  Yeah, well, it's not like you kicked me, jizz would come out.  You'd have to put a little pressure, and then I would score it out.  But more jizz boat-a-back.  Well, yeah, I was more of a jizz bucket.  Like, if you just looked at me, it was overflowing.  That's a good point.  Melodrama.  You wouldn't want everybody to look in on your fucking 18, 19-year-old thing.  You just, maybe not a full jizz bucket, but we were pretty jizzy back then.  Speaking of jizz bucket and gym, you know, I met your parents backstage at the Borgata. 
[01:20:00]  Were you working with Jay?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I wasn't working with him.  Jay's just such a mensch.  I was playing the Borgata.  He was playing the Borgata.  He called me and just went, yeah, the Borgata?  I said, yeah.  He said, you want to catch a ride?  I said, catch a ride?  To the airport?  Like, I'm such an idiot, you know?  You're going to drive me to Philly?  So you're going to drive me to Philly tomorrow?  Because I've got a Southwest flight back to L.A. 
[01:20:30]  He said, no, we leave tonight.  We drive to the airport tonight?  No, you catch me?  I've got a plane.  You know, I was like, oh, you've got a plane?  Oh, you're on a ride on your plane.  This is awesome.  Nice.  He flies in to Atlantic City from Van Nuys to Atlantic City.  Wow.  He flies in that day.  That is awesome.  Gets in at 6, 6.30.  He doesn't go to his room.  He just goes to his dressing room.  So he goes from the airport to his dressing room, like, everyone else upstairs, you know, 
[01:21:00]  squeeze one off, quick shower, not in that order, you know, lay out, take a nap, and  then go do the show, you know?  He goes right to his dressing room, and he'll just hang out in his denim socks and denim  contact lenses, denim breathe right.  There's a denim breathe right, obviously, if you see him off stage.  And he'll sit there, and he'll hang there for, like, you know, an hour and 20 minutes  eating a little fruit, and then he'll go do a show, and then he's right back on the  plane. 
[01:21:30]  He never goes upstairs.  Wow.  He never goes to his room.  He's Mr. Showbiz.  Yeah.  He said, just come on over, just drop your stuff in my room, and then when you're done  with your show, we'll just take off.  And I went to his room, and he was standing there with your kindly elderly parents.  And they're like, we're big fans, and they're out of a Rockwell painting, and you're from  the band Rockwell.  And they're like, the whole time, I want to go, are you, do you know what your son's up 
[01:22:00]  to?  You know what he's in?  You have any clue.  They're more than aware, I think.  Are they?  All right.  Horrified.  Yeah, they are nice, normal people.  You'd never know it.  You would never know it, no.  The lovely, yeah, the lovely Nortons.  Oh, we have a fun, it is Jimmy Norton's birthday, and we have-  I know, I saw a guy with a cake.  We do have some phone calls coming in, so if we could take this call.  Hello?  Hello?  Who is this?  What's the date of your docuseries?  Hello?  Hello?  Someone want to wish Jimmy Norton a happy birthday? 
[01:22:30]  Hey, Norton.  Yes.  I'm moving to Jimmy Norton.  Is he around?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Who's this?  Who's this?  He doesn't even know who this is.  This is Mike Tyson.  Oh, hey, Mike.  How are you?  What are you doing, buddy?  I was just talking about you before and how good it was to see you at UFC.  Wasn't that pretty awesome?  It was a really upsetting loss to watch. 
[01:23:00]  Man, I used to have been unbelievable.  I can't believe they were fighting that guy like that.  Yeah, it's like he got, Fran, when we come at the Anderson Silva fight, and he got cocky.  Anderson Silva got cocky.  And when he first got stunned, when that punch got thrown, did you think he was faking that  he was wobbling, or did you think that he actually got tagged?  Well, I really think he got tagged a little bit, but then it hurt that bad, but he was hurt  a little bit, and he was playing it off. 
[01:23:30]  But the real knockout was, you know, there was no question what that was all about.  And why has nobody been able to do that to him?  It was like, did he, because it seemed like when he got hit, Silva just went back better  than anybody I've ever seen.  And it seems like Wyman just stepped into it and threw the next punch.  Listen, right, this is how this stuff goes.  It's really crazy.  Guys like Anderson Silva, Muhammad Ali, and these guys that dominate for so long, they  make the other guys rise to the occasion. 
[01:24:00]  They make all the other opponents better fighters.  They have to rise to the occasion.  And sometimes when things like that happen, the greatest fighter, he slacks down a little  bit because he's so great.  But these guys, and it's just, you can't take it away from the other fighters.  He has had so much will and determination.  And it was just his time.  It was just his time.  Hey, Mike, this is Adam Carolla.  Remember when I came to your house?  Adam, what's up, brother?  I just came to Holland giving Jimmy, knowing the big birthday love. 
[01:24:30]  How you doing?  Good.  I went to Mike's house in Henderson.  Yes.  Yeah, and we just hung out.  How was that?  Was my pool fixed yet?  Or were they still working?  They were still working on your pool.  Yeah, okay.  That pool was 73% to 81% done.  I mean, I got to check my notes.  But yeah.  It's pretty good now, man.  So when you come over now, we can take a dump, you know?  I'm bringing my trunks, but I'm keeping my shirt on.  I don't want to be embarrassed.  No way, man.  No way. 
[01:25:00]  We're going to give you those testosterone shots.  Testosterone.  Yeah, I've yet to be invited to the Tyson compound in Henderson.  I hope when I'm out there, I get to come take a dip.  Yeah.  And you're welcome.  You know that.  You know that.  Oh, there you go, Jimmy.  That's an invite.  Oh, that big Jim knows he got mad love.  No, he's got a bridge with like a koi pond.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, you've arrived when you have a semi-moat.  No, no, no.  That's the ashes and remnants of Mike Tyson when he had money. 
[01:25:30]  You know, we have to rebuild.  Rebuild?  He had people walking around and cleaning and doing things like that.  Kids running around.  Those are the numbers of my family.  Oh, really?  Jeez, you're sure rude.  Hey, a place like that, do you design it or does your wife design it or do you have designers  and just say just whatever you guys want to do and make it look nice? 
[01:26:00]  Well, you know, at first it was my Luss Laboratory at one time, but then I got married and she  put the woman's marriage touch on it and I don't even know what place I live in.  Oh, man.  She just took over?  Yeah, it took over the old Luss Laboratory.  The Luss Laboratory.  The Luss Lab.  That sounds...  It's nice to know it happens to all of us.  It doesn't matter how masculine you are or who you are, that when you fall in love, they  just fucking take over.  It's nice to know it happens to even guys like Mike.  Listen, man.  Listen, we don't know anything about this masculinity thing. 
[01:26:30]  We just know it's supposed to define us as men, but we don't know where it comes from.  We don't know anything about it.  And if we didn't call it masculinity, what would we call it?  Be whipped?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yes.  And Mike, someone was just telling me your one-man show was really good, and it wasn't  because they knew you were calling in.  They just brought it up.  Hey, um...  As James Buster Douglas used to say, apropos of nothing. 
[01:27:00]  That was his thing.  Tell me about that word again, apropos of nothing.  Or maybe that was Ronaldo Snipes.  I can't remember which heavyweight from the 80s would use that one.  Apropos or Applebee?  Which one?  Apropos, Applebee.  If I slow down, I'll fuck it up.  So I have to just...  It's one of those names you have to blow through it.  Like an NBA player that's from Kazakhstan, you know?  Tell me about...  The guy from boxing from Kazakhstan is kicking everybody's ass. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Gorky, Gorky something?  Yeah, middle name.  Middleweight, yeah.  Yeah.  Gorky.  Yeah, those guys just need to pick up, like, sugar or something, like in their middle name.  Yeah, this guy's knocking out everyone, destroying everyone, and the problem is,  I've talked to, like, I've talked to boxing analysts about this guy, and they're like,  yeah, that Russian kid's pretty good.  No one can say...  He's a catchy name, yeah.  No one can say the guy's name.  Yeah.  I can't remember.  I'm from a Gorky park. 
[01:28:00]  I'm just, you know, Gorky.  Gorky, Gorky.  No, he's the Manu Ginobili of middleweights.  Ginobili?  No, but it's one of...  That's the whole point.  We can't figure this...  If someone go online, you'll figure out the guy's name.  He's the most...  He's the most...  He's the most dominant guy in boxing right now, but no one can pronounce his name.  Is he like fucking Drago from Rocky?  Hey, what are you looking for?  I'm talking about the dominant way he's hurting people.  Middleweight, yeah.  That's the way he's stopping them, and the referee's stopping by. 
[01:28:30]  He's really hurting people.  Body shots.  Hey, what are you shooting, Mike?  I know you're shooting in New York.  When are you actually filming?  Oh, did you film already?  We just filmed...  Last night was our last night.  Oh, last...  Oh, show.  HBO show.  That's going to be huge.  Oh, that's...  I was in Los Angeles last night.  For HBO, huh?  How'd it go?  It went wonderful.  For the one-man show, let's be the truth, and I think HBO is by Eric.  Yeah, it's going to be huge.  Oh, of course they will.  That's fantastic, man.  Mike's...  You know, I saw Mike like three or four years ago. 
[01:29:00]  He was heavy.  He was depressed.  He was shuffling.  Like the old boxer shuffle.  You know?  And he looked like an old blues singer.  I was singing some old blues back then.  And then I saw him three years later, and he was like spry and light and in great shape.  Like, it was absolutely an amazing transformation.  Yeah.  Well, I wanted to live.  I got tired of wanting to die, and I wanted to live, because I was trying to die, but it  just didn't work. 
[01:29:30]  Let's try to live this stuff again and see what happens.  So you're loving the live performances.  You're loving being out in front of the audiences?  Hey, I'm adamant all actuality.  Being an entertainer yourself, I just love being.  You know, just being acknowledged, you know, by my peers and people who do the same thing  I do at, you know, occupation, because they know the difficulty of it.  And that's what I appreciate more than anything.  People, my peers, I understand the difficulty of it.  And still they see that I achieved. 
[01:30:00]  So will you take a break now from the show, or are you actually going to bring it on the  road a little bit?  I believe my wife said we're going to do it in November and December.  Oh, okay, good.  Good.  And have you updated it at all?  You don't think you really need to.  I mean, because I thought it was...  I've seen it twice, and it's great.  I haven't updated it at all.  But when I saw some of the filming from the HBO, and, man, it looks so much different.  It looks beautiful.  So you're happy.  Oh, you like it, yeah.  Yeah, I never saw it in that kind of footage before.  Well, I mean, I appreciate you calling on my birthday, man.  I didn't realize you taped last night. 
[01:30:30]  I just came back into New York this morning.  But it means a lot.  Hey, man, listen, man.  I really appreciate you during the time of need when we first started promoting this show.  And you were behind it 100%.  And I know, just by the way you were pushing it, it was more than just a job.  And I really appreciated that.  But, you know, don't hesitate to ask, man.  I really respect you as a human being.  That's a nice guy to have.  Thanks, Mike.  On this side.  Oh, you guys know I got a boxing promotion, right? 
[01:31:00]  Mike Tyson Productions.  Oh, no.  Well, I and Mike Productions.  And I got my movie fighting EFTN 2, Friday Night Fight.  And I'm going to introduce my junior lightweight champion, Mendez.  And it's going to be a really, really interesting fight.  Look forward to seeing that.  There it is.  When is that?  When?  I and Mike Productions.  It'll be August 23rd.  Oh, okay.  You know, it's fun.  I'm going to launch an EFTN 2.  You have a good clothing line, too.  I like the Tyson clothes.  And I bought one at The Undisputed Truth the first time. 
[01:31:30]  And it was an XL.  And I lost weight.  And now I can't find it in medium or small.  It was like a picture of your face on it.  It's fucking...  The clothes are great.  The shirts have...  Jimmy's problems these days.  Yeah.  I've lost some weight.  But the clothing line is great.  He can breathe better.  Oh, man.  Right?  He can breathe better.  He's really such now.  I just Googled in Iron Mike Productions, and there was just Mike Ditka getting a hip replacement.  So...  I don't know if there's more you could give us on that.  I can't find it here.  He looked up Iron Mike Productions and he saw Mike... 
[01:32:00]  Oh, no.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got it.  Well, if you want to come in before and promote, if you're in town and you want to come by,  man, whenever you want to come, it's an open door.  Thank you.  I'm here.  It's my pleasure, brother.  Great.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, Iron Mike Tyson.  Thank you, buddy.  For your birthday wish to Jimmy.  Thank you, Adam.  Yeah, I'm bringing my trunks and my water wings, and I'll see you soon.  Take it easy, man.  Take care, Mike.  Bye.  That's the champ, Iron Mike Tyson. 
[01:32:30]  It's funny.  When I first heard the voice, I thought it sounds like Tyson, but I'm like, it can't be Tyson.  Like, give him that.  No, but here's how you know everyone is the person.  If it sounds like Tyson, but not enough like Tyson.  The guys are doing Tyson impersonations, say, indubitably.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they work.  Like, they expend energy, they push, and they say the buzz.  They have their three or four buzzwords.  Yeah, the buzzwords.  And that, then they're doing Tyson.  Right.  And he sounded like it was just talking.  Casual.  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:33:00]  And now I've got to find this guy's name.  I've got to tell your guy.  Where's the Russian?  Where's the Russian?  Yeah, he's Russian, but you know, not Russian Russian.  One of the fucked up republics around.  I don't, by the way.  I used to, when I grew up, there was just Russia.  There was Russia.  And then Egypt was like Arabian Nights, like a size of a camel.  You know, the guy with a turban and a flying carpet and stuff.  What the fuck has gone on?  Now everything is fucking divvied up into separate little things.  And they're all fighting. 
[01:33:30]  And you've never heard of any of these stands and everything.  And the guy's Russian, but he's darker than a Kenyan.  And you're like, what the fuck?  And he's declared a fatwa.  And you're like, what?  But you're a Russian.  Yeah.  But you're a Russian.  By the way, I hope you're not sending any brides out from this neck of the woods.  Because my idea of a Russian bride is completely different than this.  You know, we're trying to talk to Adam.  Definitely, I want to ask you so many things about your show and your stance on a lot of things, 
[01:34:00]  which I agree with wholeheartedly.  But we have another call here for Jimmy's birthday.  Dwayne Bobbick is calling in.  Hello.  How's it going, man?  Hello.  How are you?  I'm good.  It's Chuck Liddell.  Oh, hey.  What's up, Chuck?  How are you?  Chuck Liddell.  You were close.  Chuck, remember when I was at your house and we were swimming?  Adam Carolla's here with us, too.  Is your hot tub done yet, Chuck?  Yeah, actually it is. 
[01:34:30]  It's fine.  They're only getting...  Mike Tyson just called in.  They're only getting guys that can fucking pulverize me to call in on my birthday.  What girl is calling next?  I know.  Hopefully Rhonda.  Yeah.  Last time I saw Chuck was also at that UFC fight.  And were you shocked by it?  Because a lot of the fighters had picked Weidman to beat Silva.  Yeah, you know, I was shocked by it.  I mean, I thought, you know, it's one of those things.  You know, he just kept going and going with that taunt and stuff. 
[01:35:00]  And I mean, it's dangerous.  I mean, you keep playing like that, eventually you're going to get caught.  Have you ever had anybody do that to you?  Like where they got in your foot?  Did Rashad ever do that or any of those guys?  No, not really, no.  It's got to be...  Because Silva at the end said he didn't want to fight again.  He didn't want to rematch.  Now, of course, they're doing it.  But you've taken losses.  How awful is it if you're taunting somebody to wake up on the floor?  I mean, for a guy like that, that's got to be really embarrassing. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, I mean, if you're going to do that, if you're going to do that kind of thing, you need to win.  Yeah, right.  It's embarrassing when you don't win.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I think, you know, him talking after the fight, I mean, he just got knocked out.  I mean, I'm sure all his senses weren't there when he was talking.  He was letting him interview.  I mean, he just got knocked out.  He was out.  You know, you're not going to always be the shark. 
[01:36:00]  The sharpest guy right after that.  When you wake up on the floor, like, what goes through your mind?  Well, I try to wonder what I was drinking first.  And, oh, that's right.  Like, do you remember getting hit when you get knocked out?  Or do you just all of a sudden, like, psst?  No, I see.  No, you don't.  I mean, you don't usually remember a little bit before you actually got knocked out.  Oh.  It rewinds?  Yeah, it rewinds a little bit.  You know, I have to go back and look and see the watch to fight. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, when it was your fight, you'd have to go back and watch it?  Yeah, I'd have to go back and watch it.  I mean, I don't remember what it is.  It's got to suck to watch.  I think in the Franklin fight, the last thing I remember was that I hit that shot.  And I hit that headbutt that opened my head.  That was a heartbreaker to watch because you were beating him pretty well.  You had thrown kicks, which I hadn't seen you throw kicks in a while.  And he just, you know, he just, you got it a little too close.  And he just, that fucking, wasn't his left hand broken or something?  Uh, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Uh, yeah, it was one of those things.  I got in great shape for that fight.  I, I, I've been, I, had like a, standing in my training camp was probably about six months  with the, with the fighter show and everything.  And, you know, I started saying, you know, I decided if I'm going to come back again, I'm  going to, I'm going to throw my kicks again.  And I'd had problems with my knees, so I wasn't throwing them much.  But I said, screw it, I'm going to throw them.  And, uh, you know, things are going great.  And it, you know, just got caught.  Well, I appreciate you calling me, man.  It's, I know you're busy and you get a life and you get fucking children and a wife. 
[01:37:30]  But, uh, I, I appreciate it, man.  You're a great dude.  And I look forward to seeing you again, man.  Thanks, Chuck.  Well, have, have a birthday, bro.  I'll see you soon, man.  Thanks, Chuck.  Yeah, it is.  Look at that.  Everyone loves Jimmy.  What a nice dude.  Everyone loves the Jimmy.  All those guys, all those guys that can fucking, those are the guys that don't have the complexes.  Guys like Liddell, Mike Tyson, they just treat people nicely because they can fucking throw you  through a wall.  They have nothing to prove.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're, that's big dog versus a little yappy, you know, nipping.  By the way, the guy's name is, uh, Gennady Golovkin. 
[01:38:00]  Golovkin?  Gennady Golovkin.  I mean, and when you read it, you can't, Gennady Golovkin is the best pound for pound guy in  the world, but no one, no, no, no, it's, uh, it's Gennady.  I, I, I, that's the point.  I just made it up.  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't, I, you ask.  I want to see how confident he was in the France.  They have, you just, you can't say it.  So he doesn't, you know, he doesn't, uh, get as much, uh, rest.  Right.  He doesn't roll off the top.  He doesn't roll off the top.  He doesn't watch a lot of boxing.  I don't watch it anymore after UFC. 
[01:38:30]  Like, I can't, like, guys like Tyson, all those guys that, like, excited you because of who  they were.  Like, I can't find any boxers that really connect with me.  Mayweather's the only one.  It's a little like once you discovered hardcore porn, going back to sort of Skinamax, like,  hey, silk stockings.  It's always some side boob.  I wonder if they're really doing it.  Yeah.  It's a little of that.  Yes.  And, but any port in a storm, you know, but still that you're looking for your next UFC  fight.  Do you watch them or no?  Yeah.  You do.  Okay.  So you're, you know, and say what's going on.  It's really hard to get back in a boxing. 
[01:39:00]  I want to, because there's enough.  Well, you know what it is.  It's, it's become a business for like, I mean, the thing about boxing is the heavyweight  division is the, you know, that's the jewel in the crown of boxing and the heavyweight  division has been dominated by two Russian German guys who play chess and have doctorates  and they're, they're in business to make money, but not to lose brain cells, you know,  back in the day, these guys would just trade their business was getting hit and hitting other 
[01:39:30]  people, you know, Joe Frazier was going to go at it with Jimmy pay or page or Ella, Jimmy  Ellis, sorry, I've been hitting the head too, Jimmy Ellis and guys like that.  And that's all they did.  There's 15 knockdowns in the first four rounds.  You know, if you, if you see that like George Foreman and Jimmy Ellis and guys like that,  and now it's, it's a business, like literally the guys like, I need to knock the guy out  or just win the fight, but I need not to get punched in the process.  And so they go out there with their condor like wingspans and their crazy technique. 
[01:40:00]  And then also they don't, the, the, the, the Klitsch goes the nicest guys in the world,  but they don't have that street pride.  You know what I mean?  Like you hit me, I'm going to hit you harder.  You know, it's like Mitch blood green and Tyson going after it.  It's just lots of jabs, lots of discipline and it makes for a super boring heavyweight  fight, right?  Yeah.  They want to see them just like windmilling each other.  Yeah.  You want, you want that, you know, bad blood. 
[01:40:30]  Yep.  This guy's, you know, on an online chess tournament later that night.  Just got to keep his wits about it.  Just a gentleman, a real gentleman.  Yes.  Yeah.  And so he's just up there staying out of trouble, technically winning, but not putting  on a good show for anybody.  And nobody's been able to get near these guys for five years.  You know what I watched the other night just to do?  I go, sometimes I'll go on and watch these old boxing.  I watched fucking George Foreman against Ron Lyle.  Oh, Ron Lyle.  Yeah.  Ron Lyle was a guy that did seven and a half years in a Denver prison for like a murder 
[01:41:00]  or a fucking manslaughter.  What?  Black guy?  The black guy?  Black guy.  Yeah.  I believe, I had to reread it.  I couldn't believe it.  I said, this has got to be a misprint.  It was, and I watched the Stared Out, and I'm like, what a tough motherfucker.  And they said he wasn't afraid of Foreman.  He wasn't afraid of anybody.  And they were knocking each other down.  It was one of the greatest things we've ever seen.  My thing, it's never going to happen, but I don't get why it doesn't happen.  Which, the greatest thing ever would be if the two Klitschko brothers came on, went on 
[01:41:30]  The Tonight Show, and went on Jimmy Kimmel Live, and went on one of the late night shows.  And they just sat there, and they were promoting a book, you know, that they're writing together.  And at some point, Jay or Jimmy would go, would you ever fight each other?  You know, and they go, no, my mom wouldn't, you know.  And they go, well, but if you did, who would win?  Well, I mean, obviously I have a little more experience, but, you know, we would never fight. 
[01:42:00]  And then they start, and it started to escalate.  And it started to build, where one of them got beat by Corey Sanders, but the other one  never lost to Corey Sanders, and then shirts start coming off.  And next thing you know, they start pushing.  That would be a $200 million pay-per-view.  Yeah.  Right?  It would.  And it'd be like, look, you guys are brothers, but you fight other people that are trying to  kill you.  And if you both had 40 fights, dial it down a little, get your $100 million each on the  pay-per-view, and just go off into the sunset. 
[01:42:30]  Get in there.  Because they would never fight each other.  That's the big deal.  But you'd fight.  I'd fight my mom for 80 grand.  For fucking 50, I'd bite my mother's tits off for 50 million.  Or 80 grand.  That would be interesting, watching a couple of brothers beat the shit out of each other.  That isn't in a bar.  That'd be the only thing that would rejuvenate the heavyweight division.  Oh, they are both heavyweights?  I know the names.  I haven't followed those.  Oh, the two giants, and no one can beat them.  Who's champion? 
[01:43:00]  Vladimir.  And the other guy won't be champion because he won't fight his brother.  He'll fight whoever beats his brother or someone does.  I don't know.  There's Vitalian.  There's Vladimir.  And I don't know if they're both champions or Vladimir's the champ.  They'll figure it out.  But either way, they almost never lose.  They're 6'8".  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, they're not into drugs.  I've got to talk to you about your podcast.  Sure.  As opposed to regular radio, as they call it.  Do you think you'd still be on the air on regular radio, saying what you've been saying 
[01:43:30]  over the past years?  And it's nothing, believe me.  But people deem it controversial and crazy.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  You know, I used to say a lot of fucked up things on the air all the time.  And so I never, you know, it's weird.  But we're kind of in a different place now.  It's so fucking weird now.  I know.  But I don't think we're, I don't think people are more sensitive.  I think people are bigger douchebags. 
[01:44:00]  And they just grab it.  First off, there's a couple of things.  It's a technology thing.  Back when we used to do terrestrial radio back in the day, you'd say shit.  But someone would have to send a cassette to a program director.  Like, listen, minute, hour, three, minute, 18, 21 seconds.  He makes a weird ching chong joke when he's talking about Chinese food.  I want you to review this.  But he'd never get to it.  And no one would ever figure it. 
[01:44:30]  Now, there's a technology, which is everyone grabs stuff.  Everyone has their own official page that looks like some kind of news page.  But it's just them and their shitty apartment.  With a hot plate.  And they're banging it out on their Mac.  But it's like, from world news.  And they do this thing.  And then they'll just, you know, Adam Carolla racist.  And then they start throwing it out.  So a lot of it's just technological.  You couldn't grab these little bites and send these files. 
[01:45:00]  Listen to what he said.  Read the transcript.  Email it to your friends.  It didn't exist.  So now it's a combination of everyone being super sensitive.  Although they don't give a shit.  They're just trying to get you in trouble.  Of course they are.  They're not even the group.  Whatever group you've offended, they're not even in that fucking group.  They don't know anyone in that group.  They never had sex with anyone in that group.  But they're trying.  It's this whole schadenfreude thing.  We're like, everyone's trying to get everyone into trouble.  Did you hear? 
[01:45:30]  I mean, oh, man, did you hear what Alec Baldwin, the way he spoke to his daughter?  Oh, my God.  It's like, really?  That's a two and a half to anyone who's ever grown up with parents, you know, or whose dad who got pissed off.  That's nothing.  And then here's the thing.  Then it's all over the news.  And all the pussy, hypocrite cowards have to sit there and go.  And they look that shocked look on their face.  And when I heard that call, I was shocked. 
[01:46:00]  There's not one guy sitting in Good Morning America going, I don't know what the big whoop is.  My dad used to beat me with a shoe.  Now they just go, oh, my goodness.  Feigned outrage.  Boney outrage.  It's righteous indignation.  And then you get to be on the happy side of the issue.  You see, you get to be on the good side of the issue.  And whenever this stuff comes up, whether it's Trayvon Martin trial or whatever, Zimmerman, whatever,  and everyone just sits there and goes, oh, my God, I don't know what to tell my kids. 
[01:46:30]  And now you're on the happy side.  And meanwhile, you're going, we need to start a dialogue.  I'm a huge pussy, so I'm not going to say anything.  But someone should have a dialogue.  There needs to be a national dialogue on Alec Baldwin.  But they're not going to say anything that's not towing the company line, ever.  Right.  And, by the way, they're just suggesting everybody.  It's like standing next to a burning barn going, someone needs to put that barn out.  Somebody's got to pick up a bucket with somebody. 
[01:47:00]  We need to start a national dialogue on putting that barn out.  As they continue to throw gasoline on it.  They just throw wood chips onto it.  And talk about whoever set the barn on fire and try to get them in more trouble for it.  Did you see him?  I saw him.  He was throwing hay on it.  Right.  And then once in a while, a guy comes around and goes, well, honestly, we don't have enough wells dug in the community.  And we need to start, okay, listen, troublemaker.  I'm focusing on the barn over here.  You're trying to violate the soil.  You're part of the problem. 
[01:47:30]  You're a soilist.  Yeah, everyone's just a hypocrite and a pussy, and they can fuck themselves.  They love getting people in trouble.  People, and when they say a dialogue should be started, the second you start an honest dialogue,  that people crawl out of the woodwork to call you racist and fucking homophobic and misogynistic,  there's no honest open dialogue in this country.  You're crucified the second you're honest about anything.  I've been on Twitter talking about the Zimmerman trial for fucking ever since it started. 
[01:48:00]  And I can't tell you how many times I've been called a racist for doing nothing but quoting fact that is going about in this case.  And no one wants to hear statistics about black and white.  Well, not when it gets in the way of their emotional argument.  And look, the only, if you approach every problem, like, I mean, if a doctor comes to you and says you have emphysema and you need to quit smoking,  you don't attack the doctor. 
[01:48:30]  He's giving you information.  You know, it might not be information you care to hear, but it's information.  And if we're trying to cure a problem, you know, if you have gout or whatever you have,  and he's telling you to take it easy on the red wine, you don't go, fuck that guy.  That doctor is horrible.  Yeah, let's run him out of town.  No, it's, there is a problem.  There is a remedy for the problem.  And we should attempt to fix the problem.  But if you attack the doctor who gives you the news, or the, you know, look, 
[01:49:00]  everyone wants to be on the cheeseburger diet.  But the guy's going to come in and go, look, you've got to eat a salad every once in a while.  And if we attack him, we're not going to cure the obesity problem.  But, and that's the honest dialogue we want to have,  we claim to want to have is with the doctor,  but he gets run out of, out of town the second he tells you to eat some kale.  Yeah, because again, nobody really wants an honest dialogue.  They want to hear their side of it.  Nobody, nobody makes a living off of the bullshit.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's astounding to me. 
[01:49:30]  I've been watching the coverage of the Zimmerman trial and the aftermath.  And the revisionist history that's taken place in only a couple of days is amazing.  There's no more nothing, not a word on the news that he ever laid a hand on George Zimmerman.  Now it's, he was walking, he was black, he was an innocent boy walking with his Skittles,  and Zimmerman followed him and shot him.  That's the dialogue now.  That's all you hear now. 
[01:50:00]  Well, it's like, first off, the news, you know, these guys are going to get somebody killed.  Yes.  Because of their misreporting.  And what happens is, we're busy, people have one ear available, one eyeball available.  We're not really that tuned in to other people's shit.  You're kind of into your own family, your own work, your own business, the hookers,  whatever you got going on now, Jim.  Right.  Trolling online for prostitutes.  Like, whatever you're into.  I need you to just bring him in.  You're into, you're into that. 
[01:50:30]  So, you turn on the news, and it's just pretty much, well, black guy walking with Skittles,  white guy shoots him in the back for no apparent reason, and, all right, let's go burn down a liquor store.  But, it was the same thing, look, it happens time and time again.  When there was that poor kid who jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge because his roommate was, he was gay.  Right.  And they accused his roommate of filming him with his gay partners and then putting it up on the internet. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, the GW, right?  Yeah, and then having parties.  It was nothing of the sort.  Uh-huh.  And the guy, the guy was not a criminal, and the guy was not homophobic, and the guy was not everything.  The kid was depressed, and the kid jumped off a bridge.  And he was gay, and apparently his dad wasn't happy about the fact he was gay.  So, we can have a dialogue about teen suicide and about how to prevent teen suicide, but we're not going to have that dialogue.  No.  And about depression and 19-year-olds. 
[01:51:30]  19-year-olds don't kill themselves because they've got a crappy roommate.  I would have killed myself 2,000 times by now.  They kill themselves because they're clinically depressed.  Yeah.  But we had to turn this young Indian-like science student into a homophobic, gay-bashing monster murderer.  And everyone wanted his head on a stick.  And then at the very end, so what happens is, you talk to, the year goes by, and you go, remember that story?  Ah, yeah, where that guy had the homophobic roommate who pushed him off the bridge. 
[01:52:00]  And it's like, no, that's not what happened.  That has nothing to do with the story.  And even at the end, when the guy went to trial, they didn't have anything on him because there wasn't anything.  So the judge said, all right, we don't have anything.  Just admit you're homophobic, and we'll let you go.  And the guy was like, no, I'm not homophobe.  Just admit it.  Just admit it.  Like, oh, I can sleep at night.  Yeah.  It's insane.  Like, you're homophobic, you're xenophobic, you're misogynist. 
[01:52:30]  Yet, no one's ever laid a hand on anyone.  No, no.  No one's done anything to anyone.  It's the perception of it.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh, it's so fucking sad.  We love perceiving people as being evil.  But here's the thing that pisses me off the most.  None of those people even give a shit.  They don't think that little kid's homophobic.  No.  They don't think George Zimmerman's white.  Like, they don't even know.  They just have a story, and they have to turn it into something.  They love it.  It's the newsertainment cycle that goes on has nothing to do with actual news. 
[01:53:00]  And then you get these stations like HLN, which used to be headline news for CNN.  And it was kind of the 20-minute cycle, and they would give you the headlines.  And then you'd go to CNN if you want a more in-depth whatever.  Now, HLN, it's not headline news anymore.  It's just HLN.  It's still under the CNN flag, but it has nothing to do with news.  It's Nancy Grace yelling her opinion backwards-ass opinion on shit.  And it's still disguised. 
[01:53:30]  People think it's the news.  I'd say more about it, but I have a lawsuit against them for the Jody Arias trial  because they've ruined my relationship with my wife  because she's wrapped up the last 19 months of her life laying in bed  watching a woman who's killed her husband or killed her and like,  this is it?  Yeah.  We're done?  We're done going on with life because a chick who was a seven  shot a dude in the shower and stabbed? 
[01:54:00]  That's it?  What if I just quit my life to watch a trial?  She was fully involved, huh?  Oh, my God.  I'd give Jody an eight, though.  Did you see those fucking fat pussy lips in those photos?  You've got to jump up to an eight.  Okay.  Anyone that hits their husband with a hammer and has a fat pussy is an eight.  You like that?  All right.  But I'm just saying, once in a while an attractive woman kills somebody.  Let's get over it.  Yeah, yeah.  Move forward.  We can't believe it, though.  That's the problem.  We don't like to admit that we can't.  It's like why people were surprised Susan Boyle could sing 
[01:54:30]  because we expect nothing out of pigs.  So when an attractive person does it, we're utterly shocked.  What are you doing?  Casey Anthony, very attractive.  Yeah.  No, I know.  I know.  It's so sad.  Yeah, yeah.  Fat people, we expect to commit homicides for some reason.  They're just unpleasant.  They're not unpleasant.  It's so true, though.  When you see a teacher out of Florida had sex with her 15-year-old student,  you wait to reserve your judgment until you see the picture of the chick.  And if she's hot and blonde and sitting on a Harley Davidson, you're like, 
[01:55:00]  what's the big wolf here?  But if she's a pig, you're like, oh, that kid's life has been destroyed.  My argument is always the same argument.  Like, if I was ever her defense attorney, I would take the 15, now 60-year-old boy up to the stand  who was banging the super hot blonde chick who was his teacher in Florida  and just go, look, Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the court, I'm not going to waste a lot of time here.  All I have is one simple question. 
[01:55:30]  It's been a year since you two had intercourse.  Have you beat off to her since?  Remember, you're under oath.  All right, and would you say it'd be in 2,000 or under?  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, how can there be a crime here?  What vehicular manslaughter you don't beat off to?  If you beat off to this, moving on, moving on to the next case,  how can you be traumatized by something you beat off to?  Like, if you get carjacked, well, you might beat off to it. 
[01:56:00]  If someone holds you up at an ATM, you don't beat off to it.  Oh, that was great.  I love that.  I've done to my head.  She's in jail, and they're beating off to when the crime occurred.  Yeah, and that's true, though, reserving judgment.  Do that all the time.  I want to see a picture.  The second I see the headline, I click on the link, I'm like,  I want to see the picture first.  I want to see if she's hot.  Right.  That blonde on the fucking motorcycle, she was, like, incredibly hot.  I know.  And you're like, oh, wait.  Like, where does that happen? 
[01:56:30]  I don't know.  It's like magic.  No, I had, like, Mr. Saponzi, the fat guy with the male pattern baldness  and the sweater vest and stuff.  Like, it smelled weird.  Like, where do these teachers even come from?  Teachers.  Can I tell you this?  I went to my kids.  I have twins.  I went to their, like, first grade, whatever.  Their teacher has a stud in her nose.  Wow.  Number one.  Number two, she's got the full-blown Starbucks grande latte with the, you know, 
[01:57:00]  extra whipped cream on top and that thing.  And it's sitting on her desk.  Like, it's a milkshake sitting on her desk.  Like, the idea of a milkshake on your teacher.  But it has her first name scrawled across it.  Oh, man.  And so I go walk over, and it's just at her desk, and I can see Sarah just out to  the class, you know.  And it's like, oh, I'm going to turn that cup in a little bit, because if they find  out, they call me by my first name.  Like, you're...  What the...  That's incomprehensible.  I have no idea what any mister was the first name or miss. 
[01:57:30]  And if you found out, it was a big deal.  Like, you found out your teacher's first name.  They're all on a first name basis.  The chicks are, like, 27 and wear go-go boots and have no studs and stuff.  It's crazy.  Yeah, finding out your teacher's first name is, like, finding out, you know, Batman's identity.  Yeah.  You just didn't...  You didn't know it.  And you didn't want to know.  It was just...  No, not really.  There was no reason to.  God, yeah.  It's all very lovey, touchy-feely now. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  First name basis.  They had a walk-a-thon for fitness.  First grade.  Seven-year-olds.  Walking in a circle.  For fitness.  On grass.  For fitness.  Walking.  And every once in a while, a kid would break out and do a jog, and, like, Coach Marty  would be like, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Safety first.  Safety first.  Cool it down.  Let's go.  It's like walking for a seven-year-old is nothing.  That's no...  That's zero in the exercise.  Zero calories burnt. 
[01:58:30]  It's a seven-year-old walking.  They're getting more exercise than walking in a circle.  We're being told you're a busy man today.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I've got to go to New Jersey, actually.  Yeah.  They have...  So, what is it you're promoting?  What's the main thing you want us to promote?  We've got a couple things.  We've got Caroline's tonight and tomorrow night doing the live podcast, and then going  down to Jersey and doing a Mangria.  I got a booze.  It's called Mangria.  I should have brought some in. 
[01:59:00]  Damn.  Oh, you guys would love this stuff.  Yeah.  It'll knock you on your ass.  Yeah.  But I invented a booze called Mangria, which sold like over 100,000 bottles, and it's  been incredible.  Damn.  So, I'm doing a tasting out in New Jersey at noon today, and then another one tomorrow,  and then here in Manhattan on Sunday.  But you can go to corolladrinks.com, or you can go to adamcorolla.com, and you can find...  Oh, and I'm doing a crowdfunding thing for a new movie.  I'm doing an independent film.  Oh, nice, man.  You can go to fundanything.com forward slash Adam, and yeah, I'm making another movie. 
[01:59:30]  And Adam's podcast, of course, it's in Guinness now, is the most downloaded, popular pod yet.  It's fucking amazing.  I wish we had more time with you, because what you did after leaving radio is fucking...  It changed the way people look at regular radio and where guys can go after radio.  Feel free to speak about it for an hour or two when I'm gone.  It really is amazing, fucking, that podcast that you fucking just ballsed it out, and are  now a massive success.  It really is amazing.  It's great.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for coming in, man.  My pleasure.  And we'll be right back. 
[02:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show, Sirius XM.  Thanks for coming in, man.  Love to have you back to actually talk about that.  I'd love to talk more about the podcast and stuff.  Yeah, I'm glad we're here at the LA.  Let's do it.  And now, back to The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Oh, yeah.  Makes me so happy that we're coming back with Sabbath.  Well, it's Jimmy's birthday today, so it's all about Jimmy. 
[02:00:30]  Whether it's playing music he likes when we come in, letting him talk like Edgar and  poke us with his fingernails.  Well, you didn't give me that yet.  That's what I want for my birthday.  I don't want you to have that for your birthday.  We had some great phone calls, and I've had a nice chat with Adam, but I really wanted to  have a conversation with everybody in the room as Edgar, and have you enjoy Edgar.  No one wants you to have that for your birthday.  There are some more phone calls.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow, look who's on the phone. 
[02:01:00]  Hello?  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Jimmy.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you.  That was a lovely...  That is very nice.  That was a lovely...  Who is this?  I don't recognize the voice. 
[02:01:30]  That wasn't bad.  I was almost as good as DeRosa there.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  I'm good.  I wanted to prove to Joe that if you really put your heart into it, you can sing a cappella.  Did you hear Joe's last appearance?  DeRosa?  No.  What did he do this time?  We gave him a real fucking beating about his tattoos.  I think we helped him a lot.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Dude, his tattoos are so bad, like I can't even trash him. 
[02:02:00]  I just...  I was actually worried about him.  I thought he was a cry for help.  But at the moment, I think he was...  I think he was possibly thinking about making an attempt on his life.  Do you know, I felt the same way.  When I saw those tattoos, I'm like...  I just wanted to hug him.  And I went, they're cool.  I couldn't even mock him.  Yeah, I felt bad for him.  Yeah, it's like when your friend marries a big fat girl.  You just got to tolerate it and be nice.  Oh, she's got great eyes. 
[02:02:30]  Dude, his tattoos are like shit you wrote on the cover of your notebook.  In the most random places.  I don't want to go...  I still love the guy, but you know, Jesus Christ.  I don't understand what he got on his body, and I don't understand where he put it.  Yes.  If placement is bad, the font is bad.  The only time you have tattoos on the parts of his arms that he does is if you have a full sleeve. 
[02:03:00]  And they're just covering, you know, color and the whole thing in.  Right.  Yeah, that's all that's left.  It's the shoulder.  Maybe your shoulder blade.  It's just like...  Yeah.  Forearm.  You know, this...  I guess he does.  He does have that kitten caboodle tattoo.  Kitten caboodle.  Kitten caboodle.  Wait, you think Joe Tattoo thinks that you'd write on your notebook in high school?  And then he tried to fix it and made it worse. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, God, dude.  He tried to fix it, and he literally made it worse with the boxing it in.  And now I just...  I don't even know how they could fix that.  Did you see the fix?  No, the thing about it is...  You know something?  This trash is going to help him.  If you're listening to the replay of this, Joe, with your knees in your chest, slowly crying into your favorite blanket, we're trying to help you.  Yes.  All right?  You're not a tattoo guy.  No, no.  He's not, and he's... 
[02:04:00]  He has...  That's why I never got one.  I'm too pasty.  I'd have to get, like, a cheetah and, like, color in my freckles.  If you wanted to get a tattoo, I knew myself.  I was just like, I'm going to look like the asshole who isn't a badass who got a tattoo.  Like, 90% of the people walking down the street.  Right.  I would give Joe this.  Why have tattoos become so accepted like that?  And you're right. 
[02:04:30]  It should be people that have the look and attitude to have tattoos.  Yeah, you should have warrants.  Yeah.  Yes, warrants.  Know how to ride a motorcycle.  I think all red tattoos should be outlawed.  They never look good.  And then the worst one is...  I know a couple of guys, they got, like...  They got one tattoo and it's down by their ankle.  Oof.  And I noticed, like, what, did you join a sorority?  A sorority. 
[02:05:00]  Fucking guy.  Yeah, they are very odd tattoos.  And the fix he got on the KKITN or whatever it is, it's a rectangle on the bottom.  It looks...  It's supposed to be a microphone, but it looks like a smoldering cigarette.  Nobody knew what it was until he explained it's the worst fix.  It looks nothing like a microphone.  No, not at all.  No.  No.  Oh, God.  Now I feel even worse.  I feel so bad. 
[02:05:30]  You know what's the...  You ever watch that show where they do all the cover-up tattoos?  Yes.  Yes.  Dude, they just make it...  They just make it bigger.  Oh.  It's always a rose or some sort of skull.  Yes.  They can't do anything but the rose.  A lot of roses on the fixes.  I didn't even think it was that bad.  And then it looks like they put, like, a fucking Christmas wreath.  And he has a part in his arm, and he's Jewish.  It's not in his house. 
[02:06:00]  Yes.  Christmas wreath.  It does look like that.  Where travel?  Oh, no.  I sing on one side.  Never forget.  You're like, oh, this is a proud Jewish man.  And then you see a Christmas wreath, and you're like, all right, wait a minute.  Which side of the Hitler thing is he on here?  I don't know.  I'm going to take a picture.  Hold on, Bill.  Yeah, he's taking a picture.  We have Joe's tat up on the computer here.  And send it to Bill.  I'm going to text, uh, I'll fucking, uh, you bite him.  It's so bad.  Hold on a second.  And, fucking! 
[02:06:30]  You know, I was listening to a replay.  One of my favorite things I ever heard was Louis C.K.  Describing driving in with his kids, trying to listen to the show.  Oh, yeah.  And even Bobby was, like, cursing too much.  When he did that impression where he's like, fucking!  Fucking, fuck, fucking, fucking!  What's funny is I've known Bobby for 20 years, and I've never noticed, because I talk the  same way he does, I will start a sentence with a drawn-out F-word. 
[02:07:00]  What's the matter?  I'll be like, fucking, I was down in the village!  I didn't even think about that.  Hey, Bill, I just texted you a photo of Joe's tattoo.  Oh, man.  I hope you can get it.  Yeah, off the, uh...  Pull it up.  It's a little sloppy, because it's still healing.  It looks like he burnt himself.  It looks like a brand.  That's supposed to be a microphone. 
[02:07:30]  I'm stunned.  His tattoos, it's becoming like Michael Jackson's face, where you're just like, all right,  just stop.  Just stop.  Yeah, yeah, stop, please.  You lost, let it go, stop.  Yeah.  I saw that, uh, that link to some comic's website, where he's got that quote on the front  page of his website.  Some comic does?  Keep kicking him in the nuts, yeah.  Oh.  And it's like, and it says George Carlin underneath.  Like, this, it wasn't a personalized quote that George gave to Joe.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  He apparently said it to every comic he met.  I know.  Joe, should you keep on trucking on his other arm?  I can't do this, guys.  It's just too mean.  Oh, no.  I heard he put, if this van's a-rockin', don't come knocking on his thigh.  I still love you, Joe, if you're listening to me.  I love Joe.  I love it.  And here's the positive spin we'll put on it.  They're already making leaps and bounds in the tattoo removal.  Which is probably a great thing to invest in in the future.  Considering every fucking moron out there. 
[02:08:30]  It's like, like, like if John Denver was still alive, he for some reason would have  a sleeve.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's become accepted, and it shouldn't be.  It should be.  It's special for people that punch other people or hit them with pool cues.  Well, I'm getting, I don't know if you know this, but I'm getting a G-G-O-A-N-R-F-F.  What's that?  Gas, grass, or ass.  Nobody rides for free.  Because a guy said that to me once. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, because some guy said that.  Oh, poor Joe.  Poor Joe.  Ditch in time saves nine.  Catch you guys with a tramp stamp.  And, dude, check your text message.  Just see if it came through.  You've got to see the fix.  It's wonderful.  The fix is, uh...  I don't understand.  I can't.  I love the guy too much.  I've looked away enough.  I can't do it.  I don't know what he's doing.  I'm worried about the man.  I don't know who the tattoo guy is that keeps doing this, too. 
[02:09:30]  Who is this fucking, this sadistic prick?  I'll tell you who.  The same guy who was knocking out Michael Jackson every night.  Oh, okay.  I get it.  The malpractice guy.  He'll do anything.  It's fucking, like, if Joe said, put a microphone around this to, like, frame it, and the guy  did that, like, I'd shoot him.  That is not a, it's not a microphone. 
[02:10:00]  It looks like a smoldering cigarette.  Listen, guys, I think we're beating a dead horse here.  Yeah, I think you're right.  We just keep making the same point.  Now I'm going to push Joe over the edge.  No, but the thing is, Bill, the point feels better every time we make it.  It's just, it feels wonderful to make over and over.  It would be dishonest if we didn't just go for the killings.  I know.  That's what Joe is all about.  But you're right, though.  I just feel bad because he's not here to defend himself.  Yeah, you're right.  I love Joe, man.  He's one of my favorite guys. 
[02:10:30]  Go out drinking with.  When he's down, laying down on a tattoo table.  What do you got going on, Bill?  Nothing.  Nothing.  I got a, I got a phone in here.  I got to do in like another 15 minutes.  I wanted to call Jimmy Norton.  Thank you, Bill.  Very nice.  The adorable Jimmy.  And I wish him a happy birthday.  Thank you, brother.  Happy 29th, Jimmy.  Very cold.  All right, Bill.  Thanks for calling, man.  And we'll see you when you get into New York at some point. 
[02:11:00]  Thanks, buddy.  Bye, gentlemen.  See you soon, Bill.  Right.  Funny fucking dude.  Right.  Bill's a funny fucking guy, man.  That is, he put it right there with, it looks like something you can draw on your notebook  in school.  That looks exactly, you would do that like, yeah, keep kicking him in the nuts.  It's on my fucking math book.  We actually have another birthday call.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, they're rolling in here.  It's a surprise.  Let's see if we can guess who it is.  I like the guessing part. 
[02:11:30]  Hello.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Happy birthday.  Jimmy didn't know his own face changed.  It's like, thank you.  I've got to go ring the doorbell, because you don't know what happened.  There's two other certain people.  I don't know.  They're human, but they make noise when you hear the doorbell.  And they want to wish you a happy birthday.  Oh, always.  Dogs want to wish you a happy birthday.  All right, let's see. 
[02:12:00]  Ring the bell.  All right.  At least he was ready.  Yeah, at least he was ready.  Why wouldn't he be, like, ready?  Bobo?  Bobo?  What?  Bobo?  Did he put the phone down?  I think he did.  And then walk to the door?  It was the perfect birthday call.  But what's...  He's still on the phone.  He's not in a mansion.  He's at the fucking Bobo Manor, where he's got to walk down luxurious hallways. 
[02:12:30]  You know how I want the dogs to wish me happy birthday?  I want to hear the screech of car tires, and then two yelps.  A schnoodle yelp?  Schnoodle.  Bobo?  Yeah, you there?  What happened?  No, that was a dog.  We didn't hear anything.  We didn't hear anything.  We didn't hear a hint of a dog anywhere during that. 
[02:13:00]  Well, I put the phone down.  I put the phone down.  There.  Now I hear the dogs.  Yeah.  Oh, I wish they...  Yelping dogs.  The sound of them ripping Bobo's throat out.  Bobo, we've been reading your tweets.  Yeah, Bobo, your tweets are great.  What's the matter?  I don't know.  Why are you mad at Colin?  Oh, a long time ago.  I don't know.  Just a number of years ago, 2010. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  You promised me tickets to, long story short, it never happened.  I don't think he promised you tickets to anything.  I never got to.  All right.  And you want free tickets?  You asked to go on the bus trip.  You asked to come to a party at my house.  You asked for fucking tickets to the All-Star game.  You asked for tickets to the All-Star Festival.  You asked for tickets to Colin's first play. 
[02:14:00]  You asked for tickets to this play.  Last night, you were asking for tickets for San Diego for your cousin or something.  You're constantly begging for free shit.  Bobo, comment.  Well, maybe you'll be quiet about it for a while.  Like the birthday tweet.  I blocked you today again.  Because you sent me a tweet on my birthday.  Happy birthday.  I'm a fan.  I wish you were nicer to me. 
[02:14:30]  How am I not nice to you?  I don't set you on fire.  That's nice.  No, no, come on, Jimmy.  Please don't talk to me.  Oh, he's crying now.  No, he's not.  What you had to do was say happy birthday.  And I would have wrote back thanks.  Yeah, why'd you have to follow it up with, why don't you be nice to me?  And Bobo, why did you tweet me and say, no, I will not call into the after show?  Oh, God damn it.  I just got ten Edgar nails.  Bobo, you weren't invited to call into the after show.  And you still tweet, no, I will not call into the after show.  Nobody asked you to. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, I felt that day.  I knew Colin wouldn't call in.  What?  I was hoping Colin would call in and see how it goes.  Who's coming?  Edgar's coming over.  Go away, Edgar.  Edgar's coming over to Sam.  I'm under attack.  Isn't that horrible?  Wow, so much of it.  Edgar, no, Edgar, get away from me.  That's my birthday.  I want to Edgar everyone.  Oh, I hate this.  Do you feel bad?  It's still with me.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[02:15:30]  I still feel it.  Edgar's touch lingers like a good juicy gasser, like a good cancer fart.  It's my birthday.  What happened?  Get away from me, Edgar.  It's my shit.  Go away.  Ew.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Did you hate it?  I hate Edgar and his dumb nails.  I got a sharp one.  Oh.  God damn it.  I thought we were supposed to get Colin on the phone with Bobo.  He hung up.  Yeah, it's going to voicemail now, so good.  Oh, it is?  He doesn't want to talk to...  I wouldn't want to talk to Bobo.  Why?  Colin's legitimately getting mad at you, Bobo. 
[02:16:00]  He should.  Come on, Colin.  I'll do anything for him to be on my good side again.  But you're being a nudge.  You say you'd do anything.  Just stop doing what you're doing.  You're being a nudge to him.  All right.  Well, I'll stop tweeting to him if he's nice to me, right?  If he's nice to me.  It's always something in return.  Are you threatening him?  No.  No.  I mean, I am going to stop bothering him on Twitter, and hopefully he'll talk.  He'll talk, all right? 
[02:16:30]  And Jimmy, please, unblock me.  All right.  Get to it.  We heard you.  I'll stop bothering him if he gives me free tickets.  Bobo, you've got to stop asking for free stuff, okay?  Oh, God.  Okay.  And also, I didn't need to ask for free tickets to the FanFest.  Shut your face.  What is your dumb Twitter name again?  Bobo XM103.  Bobo, you're a mooch.  That's good. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you.  I needed a word.  You're a mooch.  Stop being a mooch.  Bobo the mooch.  Let me tell you a story about Bobo the mooch.  He has two piece of shit poochers.  All right.  You're going to stop?  All right.  Goodbye.  Good.  Thank you.  Godspeed.  Stop doing that.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, Bobo.  Thank you for your birthday.  Thanks for the call, Bobo.  He didn't sing a happy birthday.  Yeah, I know.  That's fine.  I'm excited. 
[02:17:30]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Sing this song.  Yeah, sing it, Bobo.  Bill Burr did.  Happy birthday to you.  You.  Happy birthday to you.  You.  Happy birthday to you, Jimmy, Edgar, Chip, Uncle Paul, and Ted Chuckler.  Happy birthday to you.  To you.  To you.  Thank you, you tone-deaf goose egg.  Thank you, Bobo.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  Goodbye, Bobo.  Bye.  Very nice.  He's such a new child.  Oh, my God.  Is he a fucking nosy Nancy?  Poking his head in.  Yeah.  What do you got?  You got any birthday plans, Jimmy?  Big ones today.  I got.  Yeah?  Oh, fun day ahead.  Oh.  Right to the gym.  Do tell.  Have a training session.  Ah.  And then from the gym, this is where it gets good.  I go home.  And I'm having shelving put in.  And so they fucking, they banged up the ceiling so they have to repaint the ceiling where they 
[02:18:30]  scuffed it and finish putting in the shelving that I ordered and paid for and realized  it's not the size I wanted.  Oh, no.  And then, ah, later, I do do the Artie Lang show tonight, which is nice.  Oh, okay.  And then I travel to Pennsylvania.  I'm doing a gig tomorrow night with Amy, Artie, and David Tell.  And it's first show sold out, second show tickets available, and that's it.  That's a good one.  I bought you shelves, floor to ceiling shelves, to display my shit on.  Sure.  And, ah, I had 12 inch deep shelves. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Because I could put my little basketball displays on them and fucking stuff.  So the guy says to me, I said I wanted lights in the unit.  A few of the levels will have lights.  Not every one.  And, ah, he goes, okay, but I should probably put it back on it because if I put it back  on it, the wiring, this way it protects you from the wiring.  He goes, I'll paint the back the same color as the wall.  This way, you don't have wires dangling because it looks sloppy.  Oh, boy.  Well, let me tell you, that takes up a little room.  You bet it did.  Oh, no.  And I don't know if he mentioned it, but I didn't think to ask. 
[02:19:30]  So now my fucking shelving units are too short to fit my basketball.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Happy birthday.  Wow.  Oh, thank you very much.  Holy mackerel.  Hi, guys.  What have we got here?  Hi.  Holy Toledo.  Hi.  How are you?  Happy birthday.  Well, thank you.  Put it down there so you don't burn yourself.  You have to blow your candles out.  Oh.  Make a wish.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  What have we got here?  Very nice.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  What kind of cake is that?  That cheesecake? 
[02:20:00]  Cheesecake.  Wow, that looks really good.  What's your name?  Wow.  Mary Jean.  Hi, Mary Jean.  Mary Jean.  Oh, you can...  Oh, Headquarters.  Such a good place.  She'll be at Headquarters Gentleman's Club this Tuesday night at 10 o'clock.  It's Wild Sherry's Burlesque Night.  And, oh, Brittany Andrews, who I like a lot, will be there.  She's a DJing.  You're very, very beautiful.  Thank you.  What does she tell you?  Are you black and white?  Are you mixed?  I'm Dominican.  Oh, Dominican?  Wow.  I can like you. 
[02:20:30]  They're scary, though.  They're very beautiful.  I'm likeable.  Yeah?  They're very, very bad.  Oh, an ice cream sandwich.  Dominican women.  Not me.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm a good girl.  What's that?  The Cuban made that one.  Two cakes.  The Cuban made what?  The cheesecake.  Oh, an ice cream cake.  Oh, this is melty.  This is so pretty.  And we have ice cream sandwiches.  First of the Cuban.  I won't have any sandwiches, but I mean...  But they're melting.  Anthony didn't even wait for everyone.  No.  Give Mary Jean.  A nice chipwitch.  What's that? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, Mary Jean.  I love this place, Daddy.  These are like chipwitch.  You look really great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I like that whole body thing.  Yeah, you like my little stars?  Yeah, you do.  It's rather lovely.  That's really nice.  You must do very well at the cluster.  I try.  What do you got going on?  What are you doing?  Of course I'm having cake.  I want to feed you some cake, though.  Oh, feed Jimmy some cake.  Only because it's your birthday.  It is my birthday.  I just want a little piece.  I have to go to the gym right after this.  I'll give you a good workout. 
[02:21:30]  Can't even eat it?  Why?  Because it's too melty.  Oh, wow.  If I bit into it, it would squirt out the side like that.  That's great.  That's pretty good.  The cookie is coming in your mouth.  Yeah.  It is good, right?  Oh, it's really good.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, we're cutting the cake.  Yeah.  You got to feed little Jimmy.  That'll be adorable.  Yeah, really tiny because, again, I'm on no sleep.  I'm going to get murdered in an hour.  Oh, yeah.  But it's so sweet.  Yeah, I know, but I just can't.  I'm trying not to be a fucking fat-titted buster.  How do you stay in shape there, Missy? 
[02:22:00]  I just go to...  Not you.  What do you do?  I walk up and down the stairs a lot.  Like, I won't take the elevator or escalator.  What floor do you live on?  Second.  Yeah, where are you going?  Oh, really?  So you're like...  Yeah, but I walk, like, up the stairs in the parking lot.  That's a lot of work.  Yeah, huh?  Do guys get behind you sometimes?  They're like, this is the best walk I've ever had.  Sometimes.  Guys love walking behind hot girls walking upstairs.  Absolutely.  And by the way, if you think they're looking at your ass, you can know they're looking at your ass the entire time. 
[02:22:30]  But they mostly just stop, and I'm, like, already up the stairs, and they're still down the stairs.  That's where you can look up a skirt.  Oh.  Yes.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got to look up the skirts.  Now I got some tricks when I want to look up girls' skirts.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you follow them closely on the escalator.  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  Wow, this looks really good.  Oh, you should...  You should feed Jimmy.  Holy shit.  No, I'm good.  Can I feed you?  Is that good?  Oh, let her feed you a little bit.  Oh, come on.  Oh, wow.  Look at that. 
[02:23:00]  I want a picture.  I got to get a picture of this.  Oh, let me see.  Oh, my God.  There we go.  Yeah.  Oh, that's so adorable.  That's really amazing.  The listeners love when we eat.  They're so happy for me.  The listeners love when we eat on the air.  Oh, good.  This should be podcast material.  Jim has delicious cake.  She could be the nugget.  Oh, it's fucking amazing.  You got yourself one of them boyfriends?  No.  No way.  What are you, a girl or a girl?  No.  I love my boys, but I love girls, too. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah?  But no boyfriend?  No boyfriend.  What's up with that?  Are you a bitch on wheels?  No way.  Are you a bitch on wheels?  No?  No, I'm just really picky and, you know.  Yeah?  Your nose?  Say that would turn guys off.  Yeah.  Speak for yourself.  You're picky, your nose.  No, when was the last time you had a boyfriend?  Oh, my gosh.  Long time.  Like, I was still in college.  That's how.  What the fuck?  Do you date, or are you like... 
[02:24:00]  I try to go on dates, but, you know.  What happens?  Hmm.  Are they dull?  No.  They're more like a headache, but they're cool.  Really?  Yeah.  Why they're a headache?  Because they just stare at me, and they don't want to know who I am.  They're just like, can I have sex with you?  And I'm like...  Oh, these fucking assholes.  Just wait until, like, the hour goes by, and then ask.  Right?  Why would they ask right away?  After dessert.  Hi, pleasure to meet you.  Can I have sex with you?  It's crazy.  At least, yeah.  It's pretty much. 
[02:24:30]  So, are we done here?  Check, please.  Can I have sex with you?  Like, feed me, and I'm happy.  Like, you get to my tummy, and I'm just like, I'll give you a blowjob.  Wow.  Wow.  Here's some cake.  Fucking cake.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Okay.  But you can't take me to, like, McDonald's or Wendy's.  No, no.  Like, good places.  Only, maybe Wendy's.  Are they general?  Where would a girl like you find guys to go out with? 
[02:25:00]  Because it's got to be very difficult.  You don't want to get the guys that come to the club, right?  No.  They're like, you know, hey, baby.  I love them all, but.  Yeah, of course you do.  I know, but going out and stuff.  Where do you meet guys?  Well, I used to go out before.  Yeah, go out to the club.  Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.  But it's never the same, though.  Yeah.  Everybody's so intoxicated.  You can't, like, really, like, talk over the music.  All right, I'm out. 
[02:25:30]  I just come on this show and maybe talk to you guys.  Do you mind talking to a guy who's got his fucking floor on the linoleum?  Do you mind?  My floor on the linoleum?  I'm in the same face.  I'm on his sugar high.  I eat some cake and I'm loopy.  Jimmy said floor on the linoleum.  Yes, I meant to say that because sometimes your floor is on the same face.  That is true.  Where did you grow up?  I grew up in the Bronx.  Where?  In the Bronx.  The Bronx.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Worked your way out of there?  Worked your way out of the hood?  The hood.  Castle Hill at the time, it was still decent when I lived there.  It's not bad.  It's still the same, but, you know, it helped me grow, like, as a person.  So, like, I look back at it as, like, thanks, Mom.  Are you still Mary Jean from the Block?  I'm still Mary Jean from the Block.  I still go over there all the time, though.  Did you read Random Family?  It's a great book about, you read it?  Yeah, it's about a family from the Bronx. 
[02:26:30]  Books are for nerds.  Yeah, I know, but, you know, I was just queering it up a little bit.  You might as well say Drop Out Now.  Really?  Yeah, well, he is, and so am I.  We're total educational zilches.  But, yeah, it's about this woman, Adrienne, who's writing the book on comedy, who we see.  Who?  Who spent 10 years with a family in the Bronx, and it's an amazing fucking book.  Jesus.  Amazing story.  Yeah.  How do you commit to a 10-year-ish?  It's like this big book.  It's a big book, I guess.  It's like every sentence is great.  Sounds like one of E-Rock's fucking movies. 
[02:27:00]  It's a whole decade.  It's fucking 20 minutes long.  So, you grew up in the Bronx.  How far from Yankee Stadium?  That's everybody's gauge in the Bronx.  Oh, my gosh.  Like, 30 minutes.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, like, everybody thinks just, like, because you're from the Bronx, they automatically think,  like, Hutt's Point.  Yeah.  Or, like, you know, like, the worst places ever.  The worst places.  Right, right.  Even though Hutt's Point was near, like, Castle Hill, it is, but still.  Hutt's Point's a little, that's a little crazy.  Sorry to interrupt.  Who set the fucking studio up this morning?  Uh-oh. 
[02:27:30]  Okay, my headset's been cutting out all day.  Why do I have STU on my headset instead of gym?  They forgot the PID.  Doesn't even make sense.  PID still.  I don't get it.  I was like, I want to lock, too, but I need to get the 12.  He's calling me stupid.  Oh, man.  God, that's...  But here's the fucking genius of that.  Who did this? 
[02:28:00]  Oh, God.  What does STU mean?  I don't know.  Studio.  Oh, studio.  So you just got regular guests.  Ew.  Bobo was probably wearing those.  I couldn't think.  That's what normally I said.  Floor on the linoleum.  Yeah.  Jen has cooties now.  That line was so lightning fast.  Why do I have STU?  Because they forgot the PID.  I wish I could explain the process that a mind has to go through.  It's just...  Oh, see?  There you go. 
[02:28:30]  Oops.  You want a new set of headphones?  No, it's falling the word in my head.  I'm like, aw.  All right.  That's okay.  You're gorgeous.  You don't have to get those things right away.  Where'd you go to school?  Oh, Bronx?  No, I went down on 24th Street, Fashion Industries.  Oh, fashion.  FIT.  Right away.  No, I went to high school.  I went to FIT, but I dropped out.  Yeah.  Then I went to regular college.  I was like, yeah, right.  If I be a nurse, I'll leave the needle in your arm and freak out. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, so you don't want that.  Yeah.  So then I just went to beauty school, Paul Mitchell Academy, and graduated from there.  Did you cut hair?  I cut hair.  I dye hair.  Yeah?  I don't like to style hair, but I'll do it if I have to.  Yeah, yeah.  Can I have a little piece of ice cream cake?  This is how...  This is what a fucking...  Ice cream cake?  Yes, of course it is.  This is what a fucking fatso I've turned into in my life.  There's a 10 talking right now, and she's in a fucking bikini, and I'm like, before it  melts, let me have a piece.  I really should be fucking stabbed in the mouth.  Ice cream cake for Jimmy. 
[02:29:30]  I like this style.  Like, I love food.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Where do you put it?  You don't even have a...  In my ass.  In your ass?  Nice.  All right, let's call this a steak.  More like a table.  Let's call this a steak.  Like, it doesn't even fit.  My ass is, like, coming out back here.  Oh, my God.  I didn't see your ass.  Could you stand up for a sec?  I'd love to...  I'll show my ass.  Oh, my God.  See that ass.  Oh, boy.  Look at that, huh?  Oh, my God.  You got a juicy ass there, right?  Oh, my God.  Nice and juicy.  Wow. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, Dominican girls are fucking amazing.  Yeah.  But they're all...  They're fucking psychotic.  Get out of here.  Psycho girl.  They get very, very angry.  Dominican women...  When you lie, we do.  Oh, shit.  But you see?  You see, already she has a reason.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm being defensive here.  I'm like, whoa.  But no, they're very, very fucking sexy.  What's your preferred weapon?  A shank?  What do you like?  Oh, your hands?  You'll choke a motherfucker out.  More like my mouth, but...  Yeah?  Yeah.  You bite?  Only if you ax.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She has wonderful teeth, too. 
[02:30:30]  Thank you.  You look really good.  Thank you.  All of you.  Head to toe.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  I'm not going to have that much.  You're going to have some...  Come on, have some cake.  Have some cake.  It's not ice cream.  Ice cream cake.  Throw that garbage on the floor.  It's not ice cream cake.  I'll have a bite or two.  Thank you.  It's regular, like, golden kind of cakey cake.  Yeah.  This is so festive.  I like this.  No, I feel like I want to have confetti somewhere and just...  Right?  Just throw it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have some cake.  You want a piece?  Yeah, sure.  Come on.  I was all shy, but I'm ready for that.  No, everyone likes to see a beautiful woman who... 
[02:31:00]  You always want a pretty girl who eats.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I don't like to go out to dinner with someone who doesn't eat.  It's the worst.  I hate when they order salads, like girls.  I'm like, come on.  Yeah.  Come on, girls, right?  Stop it.  What are you going to do?  Because you're embarrassing me now.  You're making me feel fat.  If I'm out with a girl and she's really pretty and she orders a big meal, I'll be like,  well, I hope you're going to puke that up.  Because I don't date no heifers.  And I'll say it exactly like that.  That's right.  Do you guys actually look at the pricing?  Like, of course, I don't know.  Never.  No.  But I would do that to my ex-girlfriend as a joke.  Oh, shit.  It would be funny.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Like, just to embarrass her, like the waiter would come over and she'd be like, all right, 
[02:31:30]  I'll have the porterhouse.  And I would always go, wait, how much is that?  Oh, my God.  Wait, how much is that?  How much is that?  And she was like, do you understand how embarrassed that is?  Because they think that you're this guy and that I fuck you.  And they think I fuck a guy who would ask you that.  So it was fun just to annoy her.  Oh, my God.  That would be very embarrassing.  If you commit to going out to dinner, you can't fuck you.  Nah.  Money should be no object when you're out on a date with a lovely lady.  You take her to a restaurant.  Life was only that easy.  You're not thinking. 
[02:32:00]  Why?  What happens?  You go out and guys are like a little stingy.  They look at me like, are you going to pay the bill?  I'm like, yeah, right.  What?  No, I'm just joking.  That would never happen.  I would think.  No way.  Wow.  What do you like to eat?  Mostly, like, I love meat.  Yeah.  I don't eat any type of seafood.  No?  No.  But I love, like, steak.  Oh, yeah.  Mexican food.  Like, I'm obsessed.  I eat Mexican food every day.  I eat Mexican food before coming here.  Damn.  What did you eat?  A chicken quesadilla with chicken. 
[02:32:30]  Quesadilla.  I know.  I can't pronounce it.  I think it's my Dominican sign.  No, that's a bunch of digas.  Yeah.  A case of them.  I have no shame in my game.  Bring over a whole quesadilla.  How do you pronounce it?  Teach me.  I think it's quesadilla.  Nice.  That's too far.  You teach me later.  Quesadilla.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's certain words I can't pronounce, but who cares?  Yeah, would I like to teach you some diction?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what I wanted.  Teach you a little grammar and phonics.  Phonics.  Some phonics. 
[02:33:00]  Whatever happens to phonics.  I don't know.  Where did phonics go?  No one cares about phonics these days.  No one cares about some good phonics.  God damn, is this cake?  You like the cake, Jimmy?  Oh, my God.  It's your special day.  I love the cake.  Enjoy it.  Enjoy it.  No, I don't.  I'm just wondering.  No, no, I gotta go to the gym.  I can't.  Yeah.  My fucking trainer's gonna murder me.  Just go to the bathroom.  Take a break.  Oh, I will.  I haven't since you walked in.  It's a thing I do.  See, it's Mexican food.  She knows about the bathroom.  Oh, no way.  Never. 
[02:33:30]  I never do those things.  You don't wreck a toilet?  Never.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Good girl.  We don't like even thinking about that stuff.  I plead the fifth.  As men.  We don't.  We don't.  It is gross.  So gross.  Have guys like been...  They would never do that.  Like, even if you, like, try to burp in front of me, I'm like, stop it.  That's gross.  Right.  You don't want to hear me, so, by versa.  See, the thing is, though, by versa, exactly.  I would want to hear you.  That's where you're wrong.  I would encourage you to burp.  Yeah, why not be you?  You want a guy who likes you? 
[02:34:00]  I don't expect you to be this fucking image of perfection.  You're a person, so I'm not saying I want you...  Behind closed doors, not in front of you, though.  Why not?  Who cares?  Because I have...  Don't blow it at me if you ate hot dogs, but I mean...  Oh, God.  But at least you'll crack the window a little bit and burp up towards it.  No way.  Never.  I like a girl who can fucking fire one out.  Maybe this is why I'm single, because I don't like burping in front of guys.  I like that, and I don't like doing any of that stuff in front of a lovely lady.  I think it's terrible and rude. 
[02:34:30]  I do.  I've actually gone home in pain.  Doubled over in pain because I didn't want to, you know, do anything that would be rude.  So instead of shitting somewhere, he drove home, fuck, he drove home, like, so ready to shit his pants at his fucking...  Nice and sweaty and, like...  No, but he was stiff-legging with your asses up off the chair, so you're doing a fucking 98 miles an hour because your foot is jammed onto the gas.  Imagine he's taking public transportation. 
[02:35:00]  That's what a girl wants, to almost be killed because you can't get to the break fast enough.  I can't.  Well, you know what?  Before you go out, you have to completely, you know, make sure you've taken care of all the business so there's no surprises midway through the day.  Well...  So you take care of everything beforehand.  You make sure you eat and drink like a civilized person so you're not, like, you know, having to go to...  I knew I should have had Mexican food this morning.  Oh, man.  This conversation is, like, so weird because I don't do these things, so I don't know what you're talking about. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  I hear you.  I do the same thing.  I was once in a hotel room with a girl, and I made an excuse as to why I had to go down to the lobby for some reason.  I was like, oh, the key doesn't work, and I used the lobby bathroom because I did not want to use the bathroom in the hotel room because, boy, there's no room in there.  That's true.  You open that door, and, boy, everyone knows what was going on.  I was dating a girl one time, and I went into the bathroom and committed what is the equivalent of a homicide.  And she came in, and she texted me later. 
[02:36:00]  She goes, you asshole, I was almost late for work because of your shit smell.  I'm like, what do you mean?  She's like, I couldn't brush my teeth.  I had to wait to go in there.  I literally, she couldn't have made me happier if she said, you won the Powerball.  You liked that?  Oh, my God.  Well, if we could hold on for two seconds or longer.  We have another birthday wish caller that wants to talk to Jimmy.  Hey, hello.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  I remember one time we were peeing next to each other a urinal, and I complimented you on your fat cock. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Thank you very much.  This could be a gentleman from a truck stop.  With a nice and big.  I know.  This could be one of 10,000 people.  Oh, it's your old priest, father.  No, I was so put in class because we were so nervous because we were doing the audition of a lifetime,  and we were in the bath stall.  I looked over, and I said, man, you have a really big dick, Jim.  And you said, thanks, Bert.  Oh, Bert Kreischer.  Oh, Bert Kreischer. 
[02:37:00]  See, I would have known it was you if you said you texted me a photo.  Then I would have known it was Bert.  Fuck, boy, the celebrity calls have really dropped off.  Fuck, we had Mike Tyson and Chuck Liddell.  Then it goes to Bobo and my fucking pal, Bert.  I love Bert.  I love Bert, but I could call Bert.  Well, one texted me.  He's like, do you want to call Jim for his birthday?  I was like, I'll have his number.  I'll give him a call.  He's like, no, in the studio. 
[02:37:30]  Who texted you?  Roland.  Roland.  Boy, Roland, really, his fucking connections really go off a cliff.  It is amazing.  He has fucking, he has, we have everyone on the UFC.  We get one guy from the UFC, and of course, Mike, and then fucking Bobo.  I can't remember.  Well, thank you very much, buddy.  Where are you?  I'm getting ready to take motorcycle class.  What?  What is that?  What did they just show?  What is motorcycle class?  They teach you how to ride a motorcycle. 
[02:38:00]  No one takes a, you hop on, and you ride, you fuck up, you figure it out.  What a dork.  What kind of a, that's what Jay Williams, a point guard from the Bulls, said.  Yeah.  Yeah, he blew out his leg, destroyed his career, was on Real Sports last week.  So I'm taking the class, Anthony.  Well, what kind of career can you blow out with a knee?  Yeah, what did they show you?  What did they show you footage of him falling and go, avoid this at all costs?  You'd be shocked how many people in this class should never be on a fucking motorcycle. 
[02:38:30]  Like, literally, 10 people out of the 13 shouldn't be behind the wheel of a car on a load of a motorcycle.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, I was trying to.  Yeah, wow.  Yeah, I'm going to take a motorcycle class, and then I get my license.  Motorcycles are very dangerous.  They're inherently dangerous.  Not so much because of the motorcycle or the rider, but the other people around.  They suck.  I drive a giant SUV, and people cut right in front of me.  They're like, oh, I didn't see you.  I drive a goddamn tank.  Never mind a motorcycle. 
[02:39:00]  I'll be like a wet dick and an orgy around your SUV.  I'll be in and out.  You'll never even see me.  I know.  That's true.  I see these guys zipping in and out of traffic, fucking right between cars.  It's very scary.  That's how I drive.  Do you drive a motorcycle?  No, but I drive my car like that.  I'm like, get out the way.  They could hear me.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's how I got in and out.  If you drove a motorcycle, you'd be like an action hero.  Oh, no way.  I would just fall.  I can't even ride a bike.  I'll just be like, whoops.  Are you uncoordinated?  Sometimes.  Oh.  I need help on that, too. 
[02:39:30]  This is the lovely Mary Jean.  She's in here today helping Jimmy eat his cake.  Yeah, she's a very lovely dancer from headquarters.  From headquarters.  We would love to talk to you longer, but I'm sitting next to a fucking half-naked woman  who is feeding me cake, and now I'm hearing about your fucking James Dean experiment.  I'll talk to you guys.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Are you going to be in Montreal?  I will be there.  Yeah, where all the show is going up there.  We come up next Wednesday.  All right.  I'll see you guys around there.  All right, brother. 
[02:40:00]  Thanks, man.  All right.  Later, man.  That sounds like cool.  Are you guys excited about going to Canada?  Oh, yeah.  You've been there before, right?  Yeah, maybe.  Well, yeah.  But it's pretty good.  You get there very often, can't you?  No, I've never been out there.  I've been dying to.  Yeah, you should go.  I haven't had a friend to actually go with me.  I usually go by myself, but I don't want to go to Canada by myself.  Do you have any arrests, I think?  Because they ask you that shit at the border.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They ask you that.  I'm fucked.  Any hijinks, shenanigans in your background? 
[02:40:30]  You're Dominican.  What, did you crazy glue an ex-boyfriend's dick to his shin or something?  No.  It's funny.  You went from stomach.  They're Irish.  It's to the stomach.  They're fucking Dominicans to the shin.  Shin.  I had a little incident when I was 21.  Oh, you do tell.  Yeah, what'd you do?  What happened?  Tell the record.  Um, I hope this doesn't bite me in the ass, but...  Oh, lucky thing, whatever it would be.  It was just a drunk night open bar, and the girl threw her beer at me. 
[02:41:00]  I was dancing on top of the table.  I fell, and the beer bottle kind of hit her face, and she got 57 stitches.  Oh, my God.  And she was, like, obsessed with me, though.  Did they continue the communion?  I called the cops myself, because I knew I hurt this person, so I knew I was wrong.  I got arrested, of course.  I'm like, who gets arrested?  They call the cops, and, you know, you get arrested.  Zimmerman.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[02:41:30]  Well, yeah.  He was a cop.  Could you believe they're giving his gun back?  Well, no.  Now they decided they're going to keep it for evidence for this not-going-to-happen civil  trial.  Oh.  But I put on, and I do stand by this, I will buy George Zimmerman another gun to protect  himself with until he can get his gun back.  I'm going to talk to his brother, and I will, I'll toss him one of mine.  I'll fucking give him the eagle, if he wants to carry the eagle for a little while until  he gets his back.  I got no problem with that. 
[02:42:00]  I'm going to supply George with a pistol.  So you're saying.  You know what?  It was great, though.  I had, like, the girls are awesome.  Like, we took naps on each other.  Like, it was this young girl, she got arrested because she hit a cop in the hand because it  was some crazy story.  But she saved me an apple.  Like, that was so sweet of her.  That sounds just like the guy.  I had a similar experience, yeah.  Yes, yes.  A guy put a, his dick took a nap in my hiney. 
[02:42:30]  How was it?  Was it nice in sight?  No, it slept really fiercely and then fucking drooped out wide awake.  He seems to have gotten sick.  Oh, nice and slippery.  He got sick and threw up.  Yeah, threw up.  He was eating fucking porridge.  Oh, no.  The apple.  Yeah.  Yes, the apple.  Another, another caller, though.  Oh, cool.  Well, the magnitude of calls has been amazing.  From Bobo to Bert Kreish.  Who else did Roland and his fucking magic Rolodex get?  Hello. 
[02:43:00]  First of all, I called an hour ago.  Happy birthday.  Hi, buddy.  Hi, Carl.  I called an hour ago, and I got the fucking Paul Anker treatment again from this shit show.  Oh, Jesus.  I didn't even know you called.  Paul Anker treatment.  Roland Anker me again.  Who did we have on?  Bill Burr.  He goes, Bill Burr is on.  Don't worry.  I'm listening to Bill Burr, and I go to my show.  What am I doing?  Bill Burr, like any other comedian, is not going to shut up. 
[02:43:30]  He went on a race.  All he did was mention one topic, Joe's tattoos, which is probably discussed for like eight hours.  He goes on another riff for about 25 minutes.  And I was like, what am I doing sitting on the phone listening to this goddamn horse?  Plus, Norton, I know he's birthday boy.  The hypocrisy of him going, I felt bad for Joe when I first heard it.  Really?  The guy that grovels every time Ozzy comes in like a 10-year-old girl from 1975?  I did feel bad about Joe's tattoo.  Shut up. 
[02:44:00]  You're like Han Wilson-Ozzy.  No, no, no, no.  I felt bad.  I felt bad because they were so bad.  I knew I wanted to tease them.  They weren't bad tats, yeah.  And there was no one there to tease them with me.  You would actually have Ozzy tattoos all over your body if your body would have.  I don't think your body accepts that.  Hey, by the way, how did Roland get these guests?  What, did they go through my phone and call people I know?  They're all my friends.  We are the worst.  Oh, it's a fucking...  I mean, you know, it's good to hear from Colin as always, but... 
[02:44:30]  By the way, how...  It's the worst for Steve A.S.H.M.  It really is the shittiest drop-off.  We had two amazing fucking phone calls in a row.  Wait, I'm here.  Oh, you...  Yes, we are on the phone.  A very delightful young lady is here.  Well, I do also want to...  Yeah, plunk that down.  Maybe you guys should talk this out.  Uh...  Colin?  Colin?  Yeah?  Bobo's here for you, so... 
[02:45:00]  Bobo?  Yeah.  Bobo?  Yeah, I'm here.  I don't...  I don't know if I misheard something from a long time ago.  Maybe I did.  What are you saying?  What?  Why do you keep asking Colin for free tickets?  Bobo, I think I made it.  Bobo, I already...  I already told...  I told you.  You don't ask for three points above the big...  What am I, you schmuck on wheels?  Here's what's gonna happen.  I'll give you free tickets if Anthony lets you on the bus for the entire trip. 
[02:45:30]  That ain't happening.  Bobo, no free tickets.  You wouldn't even understand the show.  I mean, no offense.  I would understand it.  Oh, and he goes, no, I would understand it.  All right, good.  Wait a minute.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  No, Bobo, you keep...  Stop asking for free things.  You're insane.  You asked for like five free things on Twitter last night.  Tickets to this, some San Diego tickets for his cousin, fucking all-star tickets you wanted, 
[02:46:00]  FanFest tickets.  You know what they call a real schnorrer, Bobo?  I gotta say, for the record, the wheels have really come off this birthday celebration.  Oh, come on, Jimmy.  Colin's on the phone.  It's turned into a real fucking downhill shit wagon that we're on.  Well, nobody can deny that.  Because we've got a hot girl over there. 
[02:46:30]  Go talk to her again.  She is very attractive.  She's lovely.  She's sitting, she's a Dominican girl who I feel a certain love for, and we're just having  a lovely chat.  I like the fact that she's a beautiful girl.  Trying to have a few laughs, a little light conversation.  And Anthony goes, I'll buy him a fucking Desert Eagle tomorrow.  I know.  I can see her face over the phone.  Oh, um, anyway.  You know, guy needs a little protection.  He needs a little protection.  Desert Eagle. 
[02:47:00]  Uh, no.  No, you should think about it.  He's very irresponsible.  All right, guys.  I'll stop being a vital cog in this horrible oil spill of a show.  Thank you, Carl.  Hey, thanks for the special celebrity call.  See you tonight.  And, of course, Colin has unconstitutional, his fucking brilliant one-man show is up.  It truly is a masterpiece.  He's brilliant, and he's very funny. 
[02:47:30]  How you put those two things together, it's amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah, thank you, Bobo.  Why are we waiting for him to sign off?  Hit the button.  He should have been hung up on.  What the fuck?  He contributed nothing, by the way, to that call.  No, I would understand it.  Nothing.  Good.  He sounds like that type of person that I want to go to a bar, even though I don't drink,  and get wasted.  Really?  Why?  Yeah, like, he looks like he will get naked and just dance on top of the bar and be like,  whoo.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Bobo?  Who, Bobo?  Yeah.  Yeah, he probably would.  Yeah, he would.  He's a horrible cop.  Oh, my God.  Why is he...  Fucking face.  Oh, my God.  You hear him?  He got all stuttery.  Quiet.  Hi, Bobo.  He gets crazy around girls.  Yeah, I'm hot.  Are you still there?  How are you doing?  Oh, I like your voice.  You sound so sexy.  Wait.  Sexual.  Oh, I am.  I am.  I am a good guy.  I can tell you that.  Yeah?  What do you like doing for fun?  Oh, I play video games. 
[02:48:30]  I go to the Met game.  I enjoy movies.  Can you get tickets for that, the Met game?  Free tickets?  Yeah, I'd say good.  Well, I would get tickets for you, if you don't mind sitting in the upper deck.  Oh, fuck.  Forget about the dinner now.  We're done.  Bobo!  Oh, fuck.  Good one.  I want to, like, VIP.  Bobo, why don't you tell her some of the stuff that you're into sexually to get her a little  more stimulated here? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  You know, if you can't impress her with your money, impress her with your sexual prowess.  Well, I am willing to go down on you.  Wow.  That's very nice.  He's willing to.  Wow, I'm willing to go down.  I'm willing.  Hey, look, I'll bite my fucking, I'll bite the bullet and slam my face into the baby  maker if you need it.  You know, put a gun to my head.  What's your favorite position, Bobo?  Oh, I kind of, I kind of like 69-ing the girl. 
[02:49:30]  That's a lot of work, man.  Yeah.  Very selfish.  Yeah.  He can't just go down on you and then let it be about you.  He's got to make it about him, too.  Again.  He's very selfish.  He's so selfish.  He's a selfish lover.  I got to pee.  Don't go anywhere.  Oh, okay.  No problem.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Bobo, what about the actual, what about the actual intercourse, sex?  Do you make noise when you, like, put it in?  Do you go, like, oh.  The girl makes noise.  She goes, where is it?  Oh, shit.  I am a virgin, so. 
[02:50:00]  Can I de-virginize you?  Oh, you could.  Oh, you could.  Wait, but how do you, like, 69 if you're a virgin?  Well, I don't know.  Do you see it in the video games?  Well, I've watched enough porn.  Did Luigi and Mario do that?  I've watched enough porn.  Ah, he's watching enough porn. 
[02:50:30]  Wait, I'm a porn star.  Well, star.  I know that.  Sure.  Oh, you do?  What else do you know?  And I think there would be an honor to be virginized from porn.  Ah, now he's saying it would be an honor.  Bobo, would you talk dirty to her?  Yeah, I would.  He's already talking dirty.  Well, yeah.  Bobo, give us a little sample of how you would talk to her dirty.  Go ahead.  You're talking to her right now, so talk to her dirty.  Yeah, I want to rein that cock in you. 
[02:51:00]  Why'd you take all that cum?  Where?  Oh, I want you to take that on your tits and face.  What about my asshole?  Oh, yeah.  I want you to take it in your asshole.  Can I hear?  I want to rein that in your asshole.  I want to rein that in your asshole.  Can I hear how you moan?  Oh, yeah.  Man, I feel so good.  Oh, stop it.  You're making me so excited. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, don't stop.  Keep going.  Let me hear a little word.  Do you like doing animal stuff, like putting on a little penguin thing or a bear?  Well, if you're into that, then...  We can foreplay.  If you've got free tickets for a good seat.  Yeah, I'll definitely do that.  Yeah, that's right.  But talk dirty to me, baby.  Yeah, you like that.  You like that.  You like that in your ass. 
[02:52:00]  They give that in you.  Bobo, you're going to need a little bit of foreplay, I think, before you just...  I'll shove it in her ass.  Come on, man.  Damn, he's just going straight in.  It's like, hey, how are you doing?  Let's go to the upper deck and I'll shove it in your ass.  I mean, come on, Bobo.  Where's the charm?  Yeah, you got nothing here.  We go back to the first thing I said, why I don't date.  Right.  Before dessert.  Can I have sex with you?  Well, there he is.  He just popped that picture up of Bobo.  There's a...  Oh, my type. 
[02:52:30]  So sexy.  Babe, you have such a big anaconda.  What the fuck?  Bobo, she's looking at the photo of you in those little European underwear.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, we have a surprise guest.  Surprise guest.  What do you guess?  Bob Kelly?  It's who, kid?  Oh, my God.  Another guy I know in my personal life.  Ah.  Who, kid?  Bobo's talking dirty on the phone right now.  Bobo's talking dirty to the lovely Mary Jean.  Oh, my God.  You have a stripper here. 
[02:53:00]  This is a lovely lady.  I came here just for your birthday, yo.  Not for Sam.  Ah.  I want to make that clear.  And, you know, it was hard to get niggas up this early.  Yeah.  But I woke up at 8 o'clock to get here.  8 o'clock.  Thank you.  That's like four hours early.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  Cool, man.  How you been, man?  Okay.  So, what were you saying?  As the cavalcade of very gettable birthday guests continued.  Cavalcade.  Of my friends wishing me a happy birthday. 
[02:53:30]  Bobo, are you erect?  Are you hard?  Yep.  So hard or just hard?  No, very hard.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Why don't you give him...  Now you talk dirty.  Now I feel like I'm having phone sex, though.  Yeah, talk to him a little dirty.  Yeah, you give him a little dirty talk.  Oh, you're looking at...  My ass is out.  Who gets right behind you taking pictures of her ass?  He just popped right up taking some ass pics. 
[02:54:00]  He goes, oh, she's a stripper.  Oh, let me take a picture of her ass.  Yeah, let me take a picture of that ass.  Pretty nice right there.  Who good?  You like it?  I love that shit.  Yeah, it's pretty nice.  There's a lot of moisture in there.  I know.  It's all nice and...  You hear that, Bobo?  You're getting her very moist.  I'll put my dick in there right now, too.  Oh, shit.  Bobo.  Bobo, who gets trying to move in on your chick?  What do you got to say?  Fight for her.  You got to have a contest.  Come on.  Who can get their dick in her ass?  I'm getting you tickets to go to a Jay-Z concert tonight. 
[02:54:30]  This is mine, all right?  What the?  There's plenty of other fish in the pond, all right?  This one's mine.  She's like me.  Fish in the pond.  Wow, you're a tough guy, Bobo.  I don't know, Bobo.  I got a bigger dick than you, man.  Oh, shit.  Bobo, explain what you would do to her physically that would make her want to go with you instead  of hooking.  Right.  With a little cock.  Right.  Yeah, well, as he said, I'd be willing to go down on you.  Willing.  He's willing. 
[02:55:00]  What else would you do?  What else, Bobo?  Come on.  I want to hear some more.  I want to hear details.  Like, would you touch my hair?  Would you talk to me?  Would you, like, not talk to me?  Yeah, paint a picture with words.  Yeah, I would talk to you.  I would also, if you're into a hair color, I would do that.  No.  He's like selling shit.  I would do that.  If you need me to smack that ass, I perhaps would.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  You choke her?  Bobo's sitting there with a dead girl on the bed.  She said to choke her.  Yeah.  He choked her.  Yes.  A right.  She asked me a right.  She kept saying harder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he did say he would go down on her.  Maybe he has a bigger tongue than mine.  Ah.  Could be.  So what else would you do now?  Would you, what would you do with your dick?  She might want it in her mouth.  Yeah.  How would you make that happen?  Bobo.  Would you ask before you do it?  Or would you demand it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I demanded you to suck my dick. 
[02:56:00]  Yo.  How would you say it?  How would you say it?  Axe.  Well, tell me.  How would you say it?  Yo.  That's right, baby.  Suck that dick.  What about if I'm like, babe, I'll pass?  Would you be like, suck that?  Yeah, suck that.  Suck.  Suck that.  What would you do with her ass, Bobo?  Right.  She's got a nice one.  It's perfect.  She's crazy.  I would smack that ass.  I would finger it while you were sucking it in my dick.  Just what I like. 
[02:56:30]  You'd finger her ass while she's sucking your dick.  That's a freaky guy.  That is freaky.  Very flexible.  Yeah.  So she's wrapped around.  Is that like a 69 position again?  It's almost like a 69, but he's fucking, he's got a digit in there.  Yeah.  What kind of digit?  Would you use your thumb?  Well, yeah, yeah, I would.  How many fingers would you try to shove up her ass, Bobo?  I would try to go five. 
[02:57:00]  He's got a go big or go home.  He wants to fist your ass.  Five fingers?  Five of her ass.  Might as well put ten.  So far, he'd be willing to go down on you.  Yeah.  He would demand that you suck his dick while he fists your ass.  With five fingers.  He wouldn't fist your ass.  It would be three fingers from one hand and two from the other.  He would just have both of his hands in her asshole.  Saying, baby, suck my dick.  Yeah, suck my dick.  Suck my dick, girl.  I'd be willing to go down on you.  Yeah, I'll make you a pussy if you suck his. 
[02:57:30]  I thought Bobo was religious.  He's a very sexual guy.  Yeah, I know that.  Oh, yeah.  Do you hear his dirty talk?  Oh, yeah.  What else would you do?  What else?  What else would you do to satisfy this lovely woman?  Yeah, well, I'd ram it up the ass.  You like ass.  You like fucking in the ass.  You like me, you know.  He'd ram it up the ass.  Wow.  And I had my hands on the tits at the same time. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, hands on the tits at the same time.  The same hands that you pulled out of her anus?  I'd give you a dirty Sanchez first.  I'd make you lick my fingers clean and then I'd hold your tits.  Holy shit.  The same dirty hands.  Zach, would you at least shirell them first?  Have you pulled them out of her hiney?  Oh, Bobo.  So it's all about the ass?  Do you like boobs?  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, I like boobs also.  And yeah, I would ram it up your pussy also. 
[02:58:30]  Oh.  I think I just want to stick to the ass thing now.  You know, I've never done anal, so you could de-virginize me like that.  Oh, imagine that.  How big are you fully erect?  And would it all go in when you rammed it in?  No homo.  No homo.  Yeah, I would.  It's about five to four.  Five to four.  Five to four.  I've got a small cock.  Bobo has the micropenis.  The micropenis.  Do I have to search for it?  He's got a lot of pubic hair, if that helps. 
[02:59:00]  Like, pshh, scavenger hunt.  Yeah, yeah.  It's almost like looking for little eggs in a big hairy nest.  Yeah, but for you, I would shave.  For you, he'd shave, he said.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, that's nice.  I feel so.  Bobo, anything else?  Anything else?  Anything else?  A fantasy that you have with a woman that you could do with Mary Jean?  Well, I'd have to say.  You'll lick my pussy some more. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, I would love that.  Would you lick her ass?  Yep, I would.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, look at her.  He'd tongue your ass.  That's pretty good.  Oh, pussy and ass.  That's a sport.  Dream come true.  Happy Friday.  So you get his hands, dick, and tongue.  No, I guess five fingers.  Five fingers.  Everything.  Everything in your ass.  Yeah.  Everything.  Go in there.  Your ass is like the junk drawer.  People try to put it in like a table.  Yeah.  I would take my wool hat off and put it in your ass with my mittens. 
[03:00:00]  I'd put that.  Maybe a lighter, some scissors, a pen.  Yeah.  Paper clips.  I like that.  Rubber beads.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, well, Bobo, you sound like you're making some headway here with Mary Jean.  I think I like you.  Do you have a Twitter, Mary Jean?  I do have a Twitter.  You should give it out because Bobo would love to follow you on Twitter.  Is he going to ask for free stuff?  He might.  Like free blowjobs. 
[03:00:30]  He probably would.  Bobo, would you give not free blowjobs?  Well, now you just piqued my interest here.  Oh, I thought he had his checkbook out.  No, he's looking at where I work headquarters.  No, but I was just thinking checkbook is such a 1988 reference.  It's all about PayPal, you silly.  It is PayPal.  PayPal, cash.  Cash.  Yeah, there you go.  PayPal is better.  Stay off the grid, right?  I hear you.  Enough.  No paper trails.  No paper trail.  We don't like that at all.  Really? 
[03:01:00]  I don't mind trail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could buy stuff and like, you know, you report your taxes and you're like, oh.  Oh, of course you do.  I hear you.  Believe me.  I do it all the time.  XO, Mary Jean, XO.  Yeah.  XO, Mary Jean, XO.  Like hugs and kisses because I love to kiss and give hugs to everybody.  Yeah.  Let's see this pick.  Pop that pick up.  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  That is a sexy ass pick of you.  Look at that.  That's pretty good.

[03:03:00]  Yeah.  I mean.  Bobo, DJ Who Kid's taking his shirt off listening to you.  I just took my socks off.  Bobo, what are you imagining?  Tell us what you're imagining with Mary Jean.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just imagining that she's in that car that he's just grabbing it.  Are you fingering my ass?  Wait a minute, Harley.  She doesn't even know what she looks like.  Yeah.  Do you have fucking, are you two ankles deep in her ass right now?  Yeah, exactly.

You know what that's like?  Winding him up like that and now letting him out into society.  I'm just like, what am I doing?  First of all, I had to be at the gym in less than an hour.  This fucking gorgeous girl here.  Gorgeous, yeah.  We chatted for a minute, and then we all had to divert from the unpleasant confrontational  resentment that was about to happen, and then this fucking dunce calls in, and then it's

I think you got a little too excited for it.  I did.  How do you start off with Tyson?  You can't start with Mike Tyson.  No E-Rock or Opie like you thought.  They're really not here.  I know.  Opie texted me.  Oh, man.  From the beach house?  Yes.  Oh, are you invited out?  I hope not, because I'm fucking driving to Pennsylvania for a gig. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, you are?  I have to say no.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's an open invite.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you know what?  Well, this has been a delightful show.  You know what?  I would have hated, like, thank God there was no, like, lap dance or anything, because  who wants that on their birthday?  I put pasties on just for you.  Oh, damn it.  Look.

You don't have it grown long enough to be able to use the, you know, to go to John Sahag  and get a little color in there when you do TV.  Get out of here.  I'm a hairdresser.  Yes.  I can do it for him.  You can do it for him.  You can't color hair that short, though, right?  Yeah, you can.  Yeah?  It's still hair.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  It's still hair.  It sure is.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Wasn't exactly a lap dance.  I know.  She literally stood up and she shook her hips back and forth and said, you got $20.  That's the story of my wife.  Happy birthday.  Yeah.  Terrific.  Oh, gosh.  It just couldn't have been any better today.  That's terrible.  Well, we do have, I guess, the listeners have a birthday wish for Jimmy, right?  That's right.  We have that.

[03:11:30]  I'm so glad I'm thinking of you.  How long is this?  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, happy birthday, big boy.  Wow.  Happy room next to you, Jimmy.  Hope you came out with your tongue out.  Wow.  Hi, pretty boy.  Just left.  Happy birthday.  Oh, my God.  You see Clint.  Oh.  We should have lunch.  Happy birthday.  Fuck it, Norton.  What?  Fuck it, Norton.  Fuck it, fuck it.  Happy fucking birthday.  One more. 
[03:12:00]  Happy birthday.  Everybody wish you.  Happy birthday.  Everybody wish you.  Need a little good time.  You like that, Jimmy?  No.  Who cares?  They love you.  I love them, too.  I showed this guy some pussy or something.  Yeah, exactly.  I was just thinking that, well.  She's Dominican, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  I didn't see the pussy yet.  This is very rare.  Oh, shit.  You can see it. 
[03:12:30]  When I went to Dominican, it was like 50 bucks.  I saw everything.  Like right away, right?  I even got a baby.  Damn.  Damn.  Some 20 dollars, you know, a couple weeks.  Yeah, that's it.  My wife don't get a shit.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy cow.  I'm like, she's so sorry.  All right.  Well, you know what?  I guess, Jimmy, I'm sorry.  I was hoping this birthday celebration would be a little better.  Could it be?  It was.  Dr. Steve.  That's great. 
[03:13:00]  Dr. Steve's checking in.  Oh, cool.  By text.  Is he a real doctor?  And he didn't say.  Oh, yeah, he is.  That's what makes this so exciting.  He went to medical school.  Now here he is.  He must be really smart.  Yeah, he is a very bright guy.  He's a really bright guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, all right.  Well, he didn't even say happy birthday.  He was just texting me.  I thought it was something like a happy birthday, Jimmy.  What was it?  I don't know.  Oh, here he is again. 
[03:13:30]  The wonderful doctor.  Have a great weekend, pal.  Aw, so sweet of the doctor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's really fucking terrific.  Oh, shit.  All right.  All right.  Can we have done more?  It's been.  No, you were great.  The fucking calls were amazing.  We can get Bobo back on.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Let's hear another masturbation section.  Yeah, I think.  Yeah, no, we got to wrap up this fucking. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, how much excitement?  One guy.  Yeah.  Fucking take his birthday abomination.  But it was fun to see Adam.  I was happy having him in.  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.  Thank you for coming in.  We'll see you Monday after.  Have a wonderful weekend.  And stay tuned for the.  Oh, already in progress.  The Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Already in progress.  Oh, I didn't mean to impede on your.  Oh, who cares?  Your time.  That fucking.  Oh, I mean.  It's terrible.  My guess will be DJ Hookett.  I assume. 
[03:14:30]  DJ Hookett.  And perhaps a lovely Mary Jane.  Yes, yes, yes.  Stick around.  We're going to take some of this birthday celebration.  And we'll get Bobo on the phone.  You're going to jack it off.  Or something like that.  I'll have Bobo beat off for another fucking 45 minutes.  All right, everybody.  Happy birthday, Jim.  I love you.  Happy birthday, Jim.  You're one of my dearest friends.  Thank you so much.  And we'll see you after this weekend.  Yes.  Bye, guys.  Watch out now.  The Opie and Anthony show continues.  Sort of.  After O&A Live with Sam Roberts is next. 
[03:15:00]  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  What happened?  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  It's like the party's continuing, I guess.  Where the bitch at, man?  That's what I'm saying.  Bitch left, man. 
[03:15:30]  It's like Mary Jean was in here a minute ago.  Looking fine as hell.  She's smart, too.  She's very smart.  Who can, what the fuck are you talking about?  That is the most incorrect.  No, she wasn't.  All right, let me become white.  Yeah, she's stupid as fuck.  She wasn't.  When you're that hot, it doesn't fucking matter.  She's ridiculously hot.  She's walking around in her pasties.  She's got a ridiculous ass popping out of this tiny little, like, one-inch skirt that  she was wearing.  And I'm going, what's the purpose of that?  I mean, that skirt didn't even cover her entire ass. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, she was gorgeous.  And then I start my show, and the Cuban's in here instead of her.  Well, the Cuban's the man.  Yeah, but exactly.  I got the same skirt on.  But his ass don't look the same.  No, it doesn't.  It's actually bigger.  Cuban's got a fat ass, too.  Don't get me wrong.  I know how to say quesadilla, though.  You do.  You guys let her skate unacceptable.  Let's say you guys.  This is not the Sam and Obi and Anthony show.  Sounded like it.  If you had tits like that, you'd skate, too.  That's true.  I do have tits like that.  She got some nice boobs. 
[03:16:30]  It's easy for you to be like, yeah, you guys let her skate.  I was in the other room.  I was in the other room eating cheesecake, watching Troy, watching who can take pictures  of her ass.  Yeah, I was a little horny, kid.  Who can you guys?  Were you feeling a little bobo-ish at that moment?  It was a straight yogurt, kid.  Yogurt?  I thought that was old moisture.  I don't know.  That's me.  You got to get that.  That's true.  I'm 40, but we're 40 plus.  Yeah.  You and Jay-Z.  Jay-Z's got to give you hope for hip-hop.  Me and Jay got that old cock.  Yeah, is that right? 
[03:17:00]  Historical cock, too.  I guess so.  I guess so.  What a show today.  Now, did you really come in for Jim's birthday?  Yeah, I came in for Jim's birthday.  Coincidentally, now you just happen to be doing my show, right?  Yeah, I mean, you know.  It's all coincidence.  No, I told Roland that I was coming today, too.  You did?  I had a wild orgy party last night.  I'm super exhausted with my voices going.  I still came here.  You were supposed to come in a couple times this week.  Mad wild orgies.  You know what I do?  I check your Instagram to figure out whether you're going to be in or not. 
[03:17:30]  And once you see it, you know.  And when you're Instagramming at 4 o'clock in the morning, pictures of Nicki Minaj billboards  on the highway, I go, okay.  Who kid's sitting out this morning?  Charlie Brown's in Chatham watching it.  Who kid's not going to make it in?  I hate Jersey because they got those stupid drawbridges that you just got to wait until  the shit come down.  You've been on the East Coast.  You haven't been traveling worldwide this week.  Yeah, not this week.  I've been all over New York.  The nigga Bond is local.  You know what I'm saying?  That's a real tour.  Yeah.  That's what it's called.  N-word Bond for political people.  N-word Bond. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Do you worry about the political correctness or all?  Do they just not...  Do the politically correct police not go after hip-hop people?  Like, can you just sit there and drop M-bombs as the name of your tour and nobody's  going to bother with you?  Well, you know, if the black people get mad, I always say it was Negro Bond.  They make them...  They like that better?  Comfortable.  Yeah, it's Negro.  That's a real word.  Yeah, I mean, I see you got tour t-shirts now.  You got the whole deal.  I'm a nigga Bond.  He's got little t-shirts with the bow tie painted on and everything.  Yeah, nigga. 
[03:18:30]  You got a website and shit?  No, not yet, but we're putting it together.  Gangster.  No, the internet.  No, I don't mean doing that.  Why would you need the internet in 2013?  I want to get you one.  Brewster's Millions.  No website.  Nothing.  I'll wear an N-word Bond t-shirt.  Does it say N-word Bond?  We're at the Harlem, yeah.  Is this Die Hard?  Yeah, Die Hard.  3D.  But you are all over your Instagram, which is what, Real DJ Who Kid?  Yep.  And every morning, because I get up at like 4 o'clock in the morning.  Mad shit going on.  So I'm up at 4 a.m. as you're going to sleep. 
[03:19:00]  And so that's what I do.  I scroll through.  What did I miss last night?  And it's like 15 minutes ago, DJ Who Kid is posting.  And it's just picture after picture after picture.  Pictures, Lil' Kim.  Yeah, of either a famous rapper, or more often, some girl with a fat ass.  Or tonguing.  Tonguing.  What happened to Lil' Kim?  I think it was her birthday yesterday.  She's looking a little rough.  She's looking a little aggressive.  You know, she's, you know.  Okay, all right.  What are you, are you afraid of Lil' Kim?  That sounds like it. 
[03:19:30]  I'm just asking.  You're not.  I'll say it.  She looked rough.  She did.  It looks like she's having some of that Michael Jackson plastic surgery.  Yeah, I was going to say, she's looking like LaToya Jackson.  Yeah, she's kind of got that, she's got, the way Joe DeRosa thinks of tattoos is the  way she thinks of plastic surgery.  Well, it didn't work this time, so let me just keep, just do some more on top of it.  She looks like she's got that V for Vendetta mask on.  Yeah.  She's looking a little Guy Fawkes-ish.  She's turned into something else.  The only weird thing is her butt was on a different line.  It was.  Yeah.  It was separated.  It was on a VIP section on its own. 
[03:20:00]  Right, well, I think Lil' Kim's butt is still technically VIP.  Lil' Kim herself, not as much anymore, but the butt still fits in.  That's the queen bee that you're talking about.  Yeah, well, you know.  You know what it is?  I know the people she hangs with are shooters, so I try to, like.  I think she looks fantastic.  Yeah, me too.  I was actually just thinking that.  The reason I was asking is I want a poster for my kid's room.  Yeah, and I mean, if she doesn't have a date this weekend, I'm not doing anything.  She is a role model.  You a fucker?  Of course I would.  You a fuck Lil' Kim?  Well, if she would have me.  I'm just trying to be respectful. 
[03:20:30]  Well, you said the people she hangs out with, they fire guns at people.  I would, if she would have me as a mate.  Yeah, absolutely.  She's an amazing person.  Whatever to make.  Philanthropist.  Yeah, philanthropist indeed.  Whatever to make her life special.  You would mix your penis with B.I.G.'s penis?  Absolutely.  Look, I don't want to be disrespectful to anybody.  I'm just going to jump in.  It's a historical DNA right there.  I feel like I'm being pinned into a corner right now.  I'm trying to escape.  I don't like where we're headed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Change subject entirely.  So, how do you, what's your move, Huka?  Because I see you on Instagram, and you put up these girls, and they're touching each 
[03:21:00]  other's breasts, and they're touching each other's butt cheeks.  Making out.  And they're tongue kissing each other.  I'm not gay, man.  Do you just sit there and say, no, if anything, you might be a lesbian.  I'm not sure.  Do you just sit there and say, hey, I need you to do this for me, and I'm going to take  some photos?  Not anymore.  Now they're, they're like, you know, because remember, my first Instagram got shut down  at like 60,000 idiots.  Right.  You had a ton of, Huka had a ton of followers on Instagram.  I put a pussy shot up, and then you shut it down. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  And he started Instagramming pictures of titties and vaginas, and Instagram was like, no.  Yeah, you can't do it on Instagram.  You need to get on, put that shit on Vine.  Oh, they don't give a fuck on that?  I mean, people make, people make six second pornos on Vine.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  That's what you got to think about doing.  Vine it is.  So, how do you convince these girls?  Nah, they come up, because you know, the DJ booth is infamous, so it was like, they come  in there, and then they know I'm the nigga Bond, so they just ton and piss.  They know that already, going in.  Like, that's, that's already established. 
[03:22:00]  Like, you know, like James Bond?  Yeah, like, you know, but I'm the black version, you know?  Right, so you used to...  I remember last time you came, you come in on the show as the N-word Spock.  Oh, yeah, that's when I was on some Star Trek shit.  All right, you came in as N-word Spider-Man.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  And I was, uh...  And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, every time Who Kid adopts one of these personalities,  he comes on to the after show in costume.  Like, he came in in a Spider-Man mask.  I thought I was being robbed. 
[03:22:30]  I was like, I don't have a cash register here.  And he said, I'm the N-word Spider-Man.  You know, when I was, when I was growing up, we had a game at a short, the short house we  saw, it was called Spider-Man.  So we put 200 bucks together, and the whole thing was, when you had a girl, you brought  her up to the room, you'd jerk off in your hand, you'd have to throw it at the commenter,  go, Spider-Man!  And then you'd quit in the pool.  Right, well, I mean, that seems illegal.  Man, that was a hard game.  Yeah, well, that sounds like sexual harassment, assault, maybe?  I never won, but man.  Sexual assault?  No?  I never won.  This is the Cuban, by the way. 
[03:23:00]  I never won, but the kids that won, they're all in jail now.  Yeah, I would have meant that.  Again, sexual assault.  Like, who's the champion, Nicky?  He's in jail forever, right?  Right, right.  Why was he so good at that game?  What's he in jail for?  Well, he threw a handful of his cum at a girl, so that kind of did it for him.  That was the beginning of everything.  So they know.  But believe it or not.  And when he was N-Word Spock, he came in in a Star Trek shirt with a wig on.  With a Spock wig on.  But what's crazy?  But what's even more crazy is when I had a, what's her name from Star Trek, the black chick, 
[03:23:30]  what's her name?  The skinny anorexic one.  Not Paula Patton.  The one, uh, Ohora.  Ohora.  Ohora, okay.  Yeah, uh, Lil' Kim, no.  Whatever her name is, isn't it?  Zoe Zaldana.  Zoe Zaldana, the one from the Blue Person movie.  Oh, yeah, Avatar.  Avatar.  So she gave me Leonard Nimoy's publicist's info, and then I sent my photo to Leonard Nimoy's  publicist's, and then Leonard Nimoy emailed Sirius and said, yo, he loved the whole nigga  Spock thing. 
[03:24:00]  He's a smart motherfucker, too, man.  When Leonard Nimoy, when he emails, does it sound like he's trying to talk through his  dentures, or does he email just like a normal person?  Because when he talks, it's distracting.  I felt like he was squeezing my shoulder.  Obviously, Mr. Spock doesn't hang out with shooters, because he's talking shit.  Yeah, Mr. Spock, I'll talk shit out of all.  Oh, they.  I'm not the fake teeth out of his mouth.  You're fearless of that old man.  Absolutely.  You know how tough he got, old son?  Bring it, Nimoy.  Does he sound like he's talking out of his dentures?  I'm faggot.  First of all, I don't think I was from the Bronx or Brooklyn. 
[03:24:30]  I don't know where that accent comes from.  That's the only one I know.  That or I speak Spanish.  So the girls show up at the club.  And they go crazy.  And they're already aware, you are the N-word Bond.  That's it.  And they walk up to the DJ booth, and they think to themselves, this right here is the N-word  Bond, I can tell from his t-shirt, with a bow tie printed on it.  Yeah, motherfucker.  And then what do they do?  And then they just start, like, you know, tonguing.  Just whatever they can do for attention.  We'll do champagne bukkake.  We'll shake the bottle. 
[03:25:00]  Uh-huh.  Ace of spades or whatever.  That's a very expensive bukkake.  Yeah, you spray the bitch in the face.  Now, does the club take care of that, or is that out of your bill?  I'm a club paying for that shit.  Club paying for that shit.  Some promoters blacking out while he's doing that.  Right.  That's part of the entertainment budget, right?  I did a super nigger weekend.  Okay, now what is that?  Super N-word.  No, it was cock of steel.  Cock of steel.  Okay, now did you dress up like Superman?  I had the old Superman outfit on in the club.  It was walling out.  That's great.  Pumping bitches. 
[03:25:30]  It was crazy.  You see, Troy, you wouldn't need to work so hard on your music if you could just get  yourself some outfits.  I tell Troy to shit all the time.  He does.  He tries to break it down to me, but I'm just like, dude, I'm not you.  Great.  You know what I mean?  But you could do like white and then put a black person in the reverse.  But see, like a black guy, like who kid?  It looks cool.  He's a 42-year-old black man in a Star Trek shirt.  It's not cool.  A white guy doing that's just like, what the fuck is that guy's problem?  You could do like white Denzel Knight and then DJ.  That's true.  That's true, because Troy, what's Troy going to come up and be like, I'm the white Superman?  And they'll be like, no.  Of course you are. 
[03:26:00]  Superman is the white Superman.  There already is one.  You got to pick like the black heroes.  Be like white Morgan Freeman Knight.  Yeah, but I can't show up in like blackface.  I got fucking killed.  I'm white James Earl Jones.  People shoot me.  They'll walk in and shoot me.  This is CNN, motherfucker.  I'm the white James Earl Jones.  See me in the sandlot.  Something like that.  That doesn't work.  It doesn't work like that.  No.  I'm not in the club, so I don't know. 
[03:26:30]  No, I can tell you right now.  I'd rather go to the Spock one that he's doing.  You wouldn't go to white James Earl Jones Knight?  No.  No.  Cock of steel.  Are there any black like spies like James Bond?  Reverend Al Sharpton.  You could be like, I'm the white American gangster.  Bubblehead.  It doesn't work the same way.  No.  It just doesn't have the same punch.  What if you put on like an Afro wig and a Yankees uniform?  White Doc Goodenstein.  And he said, I'm the white Reggie Jackson.  Mr. October in this bitch.  Reggie Jackson's almost white.  He is.  He is. 
[03:27:00]  And they gave that guy to us.  It doesn't work as much.  Do you see?  We got that in the draft.  We got that in the draft.  What Troy should do is take kid heroes like Kermit the Frog.  If you go to the club, ask Kermit the Frog.  I did.  I was at Cookie Monster last week.  That's what I'm saying.  It's on my Instagram.  I don't know if you saw it.  It's at Troy Kwan on Instagram.  How did that work?  Somebody had a Cookie Monster head.  So I put it.  I just threw it on my leg.  You see, like I said.  You called it.  Danger Mouse has made this big career for himself because he wears like a Mickey Mouse head that lights up. 
[03:27:30]  I need you to send me that.  He's on the MTV Awards now.  See, the problem is the girls I'm hanging with don't look like the girls you're hanging with.  They're not tongue-in and wretched and hoary?  See, I'll take the wretched bitches.  You should dress like Small Wonder.  Remember that show?  Yes.  I'd go with that DJ white Small Wonder.  And just do the robot the whole time?  Go to the closet after your set.  Right.  Take a little map.  Or just get a black dick outfit.  Just go in the club.  Or be a different Brady every Saturday.  What if you dressed up as a black penis, Troy?  That'd be hard.  Would that work?  I get it, who, kid?  I'd love to see if that worked. 
[03:28:00]  Maybe I'll give that a shot.  I don't see how it wouldn't.  I mean, if Who Kid can show up in a Superman outfit and still get laid.  Yeah, but see, here's what I'd have to do.  I would have to DJ with Who Kid as the black penis, and then he'd have to put his stamp  of approval on it.  Or...  But then he would be dressed like Spock, which he wins automatic.  Right.  He would win up.  True.  He wouldn't be able to come in outfit.  Black Spock is one of the coolest things in the world.  Yeah, it is.  For you, I'll wear a white pussy outfit.  Oh, that would be great.  I'll be the black dick.  You're the white pussy?  Yeah.  It's just like...  I think my mom and dad did that for Halloween one year.  I'm not sure, though.  Get the fuck out of here.  I think so. 
[03:28:30]  There's got to be something.  I mean, you got all the tattoos, but you might want to cover them up.  I don't know what they do.  Were there any black G.I. Joes?  No.  Probably not.  I wouldn't think so.  White people love G.I. Joe.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, G.I. Joe's the shit.  He's a real American hero.  Sergeant Slaughter?  What?  Snake Eyes?  Yeah.  Snake Eyes was black, though.  A lot of people...  Oh, he wasn't.  That's what I heard.  That's a rumor in the streets.  That's the streets.  He's talking, right?  The streets are talking.  They don't want us to fucking improve ourselves, man.  How did it work when you were in the Cookie Monster mask? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Were you getting some good attention?  I just did it for a couple pictures.  Oh, come on, Troy.  You got to come in.  You got to go hard with that shit, man.  And he's got to wear a big furry blue suit, too, right?  Come on, man.  Look at Deadmau5.  He has a fucking mouse on his head.  He looks like a...  Honestly, Deadmau5, if he was walking down the street?  Come on, man.  I'd be like, that guy looks like a fucking asshole.  Exactly.  But when he's in a DJ booth and he's at the MTV Awards, you're like, yeah, whatever he's doing,  that's cool.  Yeah.  And his table is lighting up and stuff.  You're like, yeah.  So I just sort of had to...  Well, just be like, who, kid? 
[03:29:30]  Don't actually DJ.  He doesn't have any real...  He paid Deadmau5 300,000 a gig.  Got a fucking mouse on his head.  Yeah, just put together whatever set you're going to put together.  And then if the room isn't going with what you're playing...  Just put Pandora on.  Dance like Cookie Monster, you know?  And everybody's going to be like, whatever.  If Cookie Monster thinks it's cool, it's got to be cool.  Yeah, it didn't work like Spock.  Well, Spock may be a one of a kind.  We need to go to the fucking costume spot.  You get the black dick, I get the fucking white pussy.  What if you dress up like Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy? 
[03:30:00]  And you wear that driver's outfit and everything, but you're the white driver from Driving Miss Daisy.  Is Ronald McDonald black or white?  I think black.  No.  So that could be the white Ronald McDonald.  I always thought Ronald McDonald was black.  That would explain the white face.  Well, that name is black.  Ronald McDonald.  And he's got like a red afro, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he's a ginger black guy.  I think he's a black guy.  Well, the KFC guy's albino, so...  KFC guy's racist.  Is that Colonel Sanders?  He's black.  How's he racist?  He's black.  Colonel Sanders is not black.  He's albino. 
[03:30:30]  He's a white slave runner.  Yeah.  Now he's one of them weird humans that's discolored out there.  Look, I'm going to take Who Kid's word on this.  He's black.  Okay.  KFC, the guy's black.  I was in Kentucky.  They don't follow up.  Don't tell them down there.  They're not going to want to know that.  Are you serious?  Their heads will explode.  Yo, every black person loves chicken.  Kevin in New Jersey.  That's horrible.  And that's actually a stereotype, Who Kid.  I don't know if you know that.  But he said it.  It's okay.  But it is a stereotype.  It's kind of true, though.  Black Spock can say what he wants. 
[03:31:00]  What's up, Kevin?  Super nigga.  Hey, there is a black superhero.  You guys are forgetting our undercover brother.  I think everybody forgot about undercover brother.  I forgot about that nigga.  I just forgot about him again.  Yeah, I don't think poor Tim Meadows hasn't exactly found that hit yet for himself.  You could be the white Tim Meadows.  You could be the white Hotel Rwanda.  None of these ideas that you're pitching are good ideas.  They're not.  No.  I'm not in the club, so I don't know for sure.  Well, you're going to help you because, I mean, what he's doing is phenomenal.  Yeah, he's killing it.  He's killing it right now.  He could be a white 50 cent.  Yeah, what about a white 50 cent?  And you could just do, like, you could hang up by your feet and just start doing curls. 
[03:31:30]  He's ripped.  I'm not that ripped.  You're going to get in the gym.  You've got to come in.  The white people tattoos, yeah, the tattoos are like the equivalent of muscles.  I don't know if that's the case.  But see, then what do you do?  Because you're just a white guy.  Right.  So you'd have to paint up in blackface and that's just going to...  That's not cool.  You've got to avoid the blackface at all costs.  The blackface will get you locked up.  But if Who Kid puts a stamp of approval on him, he's like, no, this white guy's okay.  It's okay that he's doing that.  Who Kid, you wouldn't put your stamp of approval on that, would you, on blackface?  Of course.  Let me ask you, Who Kid, I'm glad you brought up the blackface thing, because I've got to 
[03:32:00]  get to the bottom of something.  You were part of Opie's video that he did.  He did a video called Worst Twerk Ever, and it's on YouTube, and it made Worldstar Hip-Hop,  and it's Lady Di and Marion, who were in here a few weeks ago.  She gave me a head, by the way.  She did.  That's another show.  She blew you.  Wow.  I'm surprised you accepted that.  They were twerking.  He's just as Mr. Spock.  Oh, I understand that.  He's black Spock.  They were twerking in the elevator.  Yeah.  And Worldstar Hip-Hop saw it.  And a lot of people on Worldstar Hip-Hop were very offended that Marion decided to start 
[03:32:30]  dropping M-bombs.  Oh.  But you were in the video giving your approval on it.  Yeah, but I forced her to do it.  I started reading the comments.  You know what you were being called?  What?  Uncle Tom.  I know that.  What say you?  You know he was rich.  It's like a black guy that wants to be white.  What do you think when your audience is calling you Uncle Tom?  Man, I'm not worried about poverty.  You don't really care?  That whole community is poor.  I'm not worried about that. 
[03:33:00]  I'm not in that world.  So you're really...  As long as the rich folks still have your back, you're good.  Next week I'm in Cannes with fucking rich white bitches and cocaine and shit.  Okay, so look at his Instagram.  He's having no problems.  I mean, I'm in different parts of the world, man.  These guys are in the hood and the projects.  You're saying poverty is the new racism.  I'm like, ah, you poor...  That's still on MySpace.  Come on, man.  That's what I'm going to be poor, Spock.  As long as the white people are laughing at you, you're kind of in good shape.  Come on, man.  I ain't worried about them niggas, man. 
[03:33:30]  Just keep them laughing.  Okay.  I mean, that's a strategy.  Because I was talking to Troy the other day, and I was saying, as much as Who Kid Jokes  around and stuff, there has to be common time, because he comes in, he drops m-bombs like  it's nobody's business, and he makes it comfortable for other white guys to drop m-bombs.  I don't give a fuck.  And they come up to you, do they not?  Listeners of After Opie and Anthony Live, they come up to you in the club...  They'd be walling out.  Who Kid?  My nigga.  Right.  And they're dropping m-bombs.  At some point, you have to say, I don't know if I like all these white people dropping  m-bombs at me. 
[03:34:00]  I don't know if I'm doing the right thing right now.  Believe it or not, more black people go more crazy when they see me.  They be melting and shit.  But there's never...  Screaming nigga and all this stuff.  You don't go home and question, I don't know if I like all these white people calling  me that.  Bro, when I leave here, I'm going to Starbucks, and I'm going to get a caramel macchiata and  a little fucking tablet.  So you're saying you're making that money.  I don't know what the fuck about these things, man.  You can afford...  You have a great life, Black Spock.  You say, keep dropping those m-bombs as long as you keep paying for my macchiatas.  That's it, man. 
[03:34:30]  Next week is Cannes, a week after Dubai, and then if South Africa wires me the fucking  money, them niggas send me the money, I'm in South Africa.  You know what I'm saying?  You're a businessman, dude.  Come on, pay me, niggas.  You're about your money.  Fucking shit.  You're not about social injustices.  You're going to three places that have no middle class.  It's perfect.  No poverty.  That's the number one fucking rule.  Stay away from the poor people.  That's it, man.  No poverty.  Dan in New Orleans.  Hey, I need to ask y'all a favor.  Either who could, can tell, give Sam permission to just say the word, or if Sam could just 
[03:35:00]  say Black Spider-Man, because every time I hear the n-word, the n-word Spider-Man, it  just gives me the deuce chills.  Yeah, it sounds funny, right?  Come on, come on, Sam.  Give me one.  Give me one.  I have to, I've said it before, and I understand that you've given me the pass fully.  But you reversed it, too.  It's supposed to be Spider-Nigga.  Oh, I know.  I thought it was Spider-N-Word.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  He's like a fucking vagina, man.  He is.  He is, isn't he?  No, I just own it.  Just say it.  You got the pass.  Don't be a uterus, man.  Don't be a uterus, man.  Say it.  You're jealous that I have that much of a pass. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, but you just blow it.  Come on, man.  Don't be a uterus, man.  Get it going.  I'm not being a uterus, first and foremost.  You just gotta own it.  And second of all, when I use it, it'll have the power it needs.  Beyond that.  Beyond that.  Your girl will be like, fuck me, nigga.  She don't tell you that?  No, she doesn't tell me that.  Okay.  If she did, I would ask her to please stop calling me that.  Because I don't know what's playing in her head, but it doesn't match what's in front of her.  So I don't like that.  I would take that as a compliment if my girl said that to me.  You know what I would say?  That's the shit I don't like.  That's why I like Troy, man. 
[03:36:00]  Troy, you know.  See?  That's my nigga.  Yeah, but Troy's got one goal in life.  He's only got one goal.  You know, he does a DJing.  He does his tattoos.  He does his skating.  He does his production of everything.  He's only got one goal.  Okay.  And that's to have permission to use the N-word wherever he goes.  That's the only goal.  I need it before I die.  That Troy has in life.  Yeah, I do.  He wants to be able to go to Harlem.  He wants to be able to walk onto basketball courts and just start driving.  How do you marry a black girl?  Well, I'm with a Hispanic girl.  I hear Hispanic people saying it, so I'm like, well, that kind of gives me a little bit of a pass.  Yeah, but it's got to be first generation. 
[03:36:30]  You have to be Spanish.  Come on, man.  Spanish at times.  Not Chinese are saying it.  My nigga.  What's up, my nigga?  But I can't understand him, so it doesn't count.  It doesn't, doesn't it?  Ah, shit.  What did you think of all the heat that Lil Wayne took?  I don't know.  There was a story a couple weeks ago, but he's filming a video.  In the video, the American flag drops behind him.  Oh, yeah.  And somebody was shooting it with their cell phone, and you could see they're filming the video,  and he's stepping on the American flag.  Oh, shit.  But I said, I don't think they're actually filming that for the video.  It looks like it's just the backdrop falls. 
[03:37:00]  But he was stepping on it.  I don't think he was stepping on it for the purpose of the video, but regardless, he was  stepping on it.  The video's come out now, and he doesn't step on the flag in the video.  He's anti-American now.  But people know.  What do you think of that?  I mean, I was more mad that he had Crocs on, and he's a rapper.  That's your, your beef is more the fact that...  I was so furious.  Right, like, if you're going to step on that flag...  Come on, man.  I'm going to step on a flag with Crocs on them.  Don't be a rapper wearing Crocs.  Fuck out of here.  What color were they?  They were, like, beige. 
[03:37:30]  What?  Beige Crocs?  What's he doing?  The white boy joints.  Well, he took those ridiculous stretchy pants.  You mean jeggings?  Yeah.  He tried to bring that in.  And he did.  I mean, a lot of people were rocking them.  Yeah.  So he's like, all right, I'm going to take the...  What is the shittiest thing that white people wear?  Crocs.  Oh, Crocs.  Let me fucking wear those.  Troy.  Troy.  Hear me out on this.  Holy shit.  How many DJs DJing Crocs right now?  None.  My lord.  Troy.  No, I know.  Believe me, I know how this shit works.  I've seen it happen a million times.  Put some Crocs on next time you're in the club.  That might be the new thing. 
[03:38:00]  Beige Crocs.  Yeah.  What happens if you came out with jeggings and Crocs?  Buy a flag.  That's not a trend.  Get some Crocs.  That's not a trend I'm ready to jump on yet.  You've got to start the trends, Troy.  Right, who, kid?  Who else out there in the clubs is wearing Spock outfits?  Me.  That's it.  Right.  But wait until a year from now.  What?  Everybody's going to be on that shit.  No, I think it'll probably just be you still.  I think for the Spock thing, it'll probably still just be you.  You know what's so fucking eerily hot?  I like that fucking shirt.  Like, I'm going to start wearing that Star Trek shirt everywhere I go. 
[03:38:30]  The tight shirts are very in style now.  I'm going to get to this wedding I got to go on August 3rd.  Whose wedding is it?  Some bitch I know.  I don't know.  It's not a famous person?  Nah, some bitch I know.  Do you support weddings?  Hell fucking no.  Do you think it's a bad idea generally?  I'm married.  This shit is horrible, yo.  I got married on Saturday.  Oh, boy.  Why'd you do that for?  Why?  It was over.  I had no choice.  I was against the wall.  It was either that or create some weird shit like,  Cole, I got kidnapped or something.  It was it.  You ran over your head. 
[03:39:00]  That was it.  I don't know how people do that shit, man.  A lot of people came and didn't give me gifts.  What?  Nah, fuck that.  That's bullshit.  Trank shit.  Eat stuff.  That's fucked up.  And they just enjoyed themselves.  Had a grand old time.  I called them the next day and told me what a great time they had.  On year nine.  So the biggest white trick.  It was awesome.  I'm like, you motherfucker, get off this phone.  Well, they do have one year to get you a gift.  And now you're zapping up my phone bill.  They do have one year to get you a gift, though.  What?  This isn't Sears? 
[03:39:30]  I didn't have one year to pay it.  Yeah, he's right.  I mean, it's pretty shitty.  I call bullshit.  And was it a nice wedding?  You put on a good party.  You got all your chef friends.  So you're fresh right now.  You know.  Yeah.  My God.  Who, kid?  How's your marriage?  That shit is fucking shit.  It's terrible.  How long have you been married?  15 bullshit years.  How do you get away kissing bitches on Instagram?  I'll be fucking bitches, man.  Fuck kissing.  I go all out.  I'm trying to help you out, Black Spock.  I don't know that you have one.  Okay, so you fucked bitch.  Super nigga.  Now, you are married.  So you're telling me you commit infidelity. 
[03:40:00]  I'm cock of steel, B.  Yeah.  You can't have that name and not.  I'm going to start answering questions with superhero things.  Did you cheat on me?  Thor.  I'm the black door, bitch.  I'm Spanish Incredible Hulk, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yo, right now, pussy is straight kryptonite right now.  If I see that shit, I go, ooh.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Did your wife ever say, who, kid?  Hmm.  You make it very public that you fuck bitches.  Yeah.  I'm married to you.  I have two kids by you.  Damn, dude.  Could you knock that off? 
[03:40:30]  Don't suck these cock, these nuts.  You know what I'm saying?  Because I got to get too pussy up.  What are you talking about?  Talk to you after I get back from Kansas?  Yeah.  And don't act like a poor person?  Because you can't fuck a bitch more than 10 years.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Well, I've only been with my wife eight years.  You've been with your girl eight years?  Yeah.  I mean, we've been married for one year.  So you got two more years before we start fucking some other bitch.  That's it.  And then once you start one, I'm assuming you just end up on the Instagram.  You snowball.  Trail of tears.  It's a snowball, huh?  You know what it is?  I lost my virginity when I was 19.  Are you saying that I'll end up snowballing somebody that quickly?  No, no, no.  It snowballs. 
[03:41:00]  Once you start fucking some side pussy, then you have to just keep fucking side pussy, right?  The snowball effect.  Yeah.  I guess once your morals have been corrupted, they're corrupted.  You're like, I'm ball's deep.  Might as well keep going.  It's not like I'm going to get in less trouble for 10 than 1.  Right.  I'm up to like 800 bitches now.  You think maybe 800 women you've fucked behind your wife's back.  How many does she know about?  800.  800.  Now 800.  How do you say, you got to make sure that you look fresh when you're in a club? 
[03:41:30]  Because you're talking about, you know, you're wearing these ridiculous outfits.  You're still fucking bitches.  You got to make sure you look smooth.  I work out.  You know, I go to the dentist and shit.  Wait a minute.  How do you keep, you have a close shave too.  Yeah, I'm shaving my shit, you know?  You know your razor doesn't need a vibrating handle, right?  It doesn't need a back scratch.  It doesn't need 10 blades.  A lot of people think it does.  Seriously.  Who cares?  Have you noticed the price you pay for new razor blades?  A fortune.  This shit is crazy paper, kid.  How much?  Crazy paper.  Is that in pesos?  We're rolling it.  You're doing this every month for the rest of your life.

[03:43:00]  Hi-ya.  Dollarshaveclub.com.  Hi-ya.  That's dollarshaveclub.com.  Whoa.  I feel like we've learned a lot today.  Yes, we did, nigga.  Troy, I hope we helped your career.  Who, kid?  Your marriage still appears to be in shambles, but...  You're having a good time.  Yeah, it sounds like life is good.  Because you lose either way, so you might as well just choose...  To fuck bitches.  Fuck bitches, man.  That's the hashtag.  Hashtag fuck bitches.  Cuban, you've made a terrible mistake.  You made a horrible...  How do I ask the people to give me the money that didn't give me money for the wedding? 
[03:43:30]  I mean, technically, Troy is right.  How do I get it?  Troy is right by manners.  If you're talking about manners, they have a year to give you a gift.  That's the rule.  That's unacceptable.  Yeah, I agree.  But that's the rule.  They are on my Facebook.  So hit them on your Facebook.  You know what you do?  You blow the spot up like child support?  This is what you do.  You tell your friend.  You tell a friend of a friend.  They didn't give me a gift, blah, blah, blah, and hope.  Or tell them to let it get back to them.  So that that friend of a friend says, hey, did you bring a gift? 
[03:44:00]  Because he said you didn't...  Did you forget?  Or, yeah, I almost forgot.  And then hopefully you can get the friend...  And then wait the year after I let them know that I'm looking for it.  This is embarrassing, yo.  And then if the year passes and there's no gift...  What happens if someone says they're coming and then doesn't come?  Do they still owe me a gift?  They don't have to, but they should.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  If they RSVP'd yes?  Yeah.  Then they owe you like two gifts.  Yeah.  How fucking yes?  Because you had to pay for that plate, dude.  All right, Roland.  All right, look.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.
