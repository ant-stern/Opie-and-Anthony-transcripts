<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts detailing their pre-show activities, followed by a lengthy period of silence punctuated by “We’ll be right back” announcements and a playing of The Smiths' "The Wasteland."  The show proper began with discussion of their upcoming two-day break and a desire for sleep. This transitioned into reminiscences about Long Island, their youthful vandalism (including mailbox destruction and throwing objects from cars), and recent bizarre Long Island events like a cross burning and a frozen turkey assault.  The main focus then shifted to the infamous Indiana Pacers-Detroit Pistons brawl.  The hosts used highly offensive language while analyzing the fight, replaying video footage and making crude jokes about the players and, particularly, the fans.  Numerous callers, including Earl and Steve, offered their perspectives on the violence.  A caller, Sarah from Oregon, engaged in a sexually explicit conversation with the hosts while describing her sex toys.

The show continued with a call from Jim, who recounted being mistaken for a drunk due to a head injury sustained when a boat fell on him. The hosts then attempted to set Jim up with Elena from NYConfidential.com, discussing her physical attributes in detail.  This was followed by a call from George, a paramedic, describing a bar fight involving two midgets, one of whom headbutted a larger man in the testicles.  The discussion then moved to a Wisconsin deer hunting feud resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, which led into Anthony recounting a graphic detail of a childhood incident involving a gun, dune buggies, tequila, and the accidental shooting of his friend Juan Reyes' eight-year-old son. The segment concluded with playing and discussing listener-submitted "Monster Rain" songs, parodies based on a Jim Norton childhood experience, along with discussion of Norton's upcoming Law & Order-style audition and a mention of Ben's text about seeing Bono at the SNL after-party.

A later segment began with a discussion about a text message mix-up possibly involving Bono, followed by playing a U2 song from *Saturday Night Live*. A listener then complained about the excessive U2 playing, prompting the hosts to defend their music choices, citing the effect of satellite radio replays.  The conversation shifted to a comedic bit about “Psycho Mark,” a former employee who gave an interview to Fox News about the hosts' firing following the "Sex for Sam" incident at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The hosts played audio from the interview, mocking Psycho Mark and recounting details of the incident, including the 40-second delay system.  This was followed by vulgar discussion of the incident and Psycho Mark's actions.  A humorous segment about bathroom habits in their workplace then ensued, featuring numerous crude descriptions of bowel movements and bathroom experiences, reminiscing about a former janitor nicknamed "Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS," and his toilet-unclogging methods.  The conversation touched on marital fights and financial difficulties before returning to bathroom anecdotes and concluding with a Casey Kasem American Top 40 outtake.

A subsequent segment focused heavily on anal cleanliness, with callers sharing their methods.  The discussion also delved into the smells of oral sex and unexpected bowel movements.  This segment also included more "Monster Rain" songs, with Aaron from Florida appearing in-studio to present his version (a parody of an Eminem song) containing explicit lyrics detailing sexual acts between minors.  Further discussion of the song’s quality followed.  Lady Di, a frequent, intoxicated caller, also appeared, rambling about her unemployment, relationships, and drinking habits, prompting a listener to offer rehab assistance.  The segment ended with a brief discussion of the JFK assassination and a review of new pornography releases.

The final segment discussed the video game "JFK: Reload,"  other controversial games (including one based on Black Hawk Down), and a website offering remote-controlled hunting. The “Naked Cowboy” of Times Square was also discussed. The show concluded with listener calls about what they learned from the show, often with vulgar or humorous comments, and a rant about truck drivers.  Mention was made of an upcoming audition for one of the hosts.

[00:12:00]  Thank you.  little catch-up play some of the benchmark things that we have done so far okay we get we had two  years off right and then it's like hey cool two days off coming up well i'm psyched for two days  hang out remember when we said i don't you know a week's vacation isn't going to mean the same  anymore yeah when you get two years to do stuff yep you know what i'm i can't wait for two days  off i know wait it has nothing to do with coming into work it's because it's not work really isn't 
[00:12:30]  a job come in here and hang out and goof on stuff all day it's it's not a job so it's not like oh  i don't want to come in i just don't want to wake up that early i want time to sleep that's great  isn't it get a couple of days off what do you want to do i want to be unconscious that's what i need  two days for to just sleep and then i'll screw it all up like i do every weekend this is what i do  every weekend i uh go home friday and i i go to sleep the normal time i usually go to sleep my 
[00:13:00]  little betty by time which is probably somewhere between nine and ten o'clock p.m friday night you  did that yeah that's what i usually do yeah but then saturday morning rolls around i don't have to  get up at uh four in the morning so i i sleep and i i sleep in late maybe eight thirty nine in the  morning but you know something that screws me up yeah because then uh you you can't get back into  that waking up at four in the morning thing again mornings truly do blow it's a whole different 
[00:13:30]  scheme of things and then if you if you you're you are able to sleep for a few extra hours it just  blows it for uh when you got to get up early again i've uh talked to some veterans of morning radio  some veterans and uh like brother wheeze up there in rochester and doing it forever forever and uh  he goes you never get used to it you never do right i go what could we do uh you can't do anything  you never get used to it i've gotten a little bit better about it than i was those first few weeks 
[00:14:00]  were just brutal coming in here and falling asleep driving home yeah where i would be on the expressway  driving home and go do those things where it's like i'm driving i'm driving i'm driving what what the  hell was that holy shit i was completely out i was out for uh i don't know a minute or a second  and you need all of your attention when you're driving the long island expressway these days  yes you do frozen turkeys coming flying at you from all directions frozen turkeys burning crosses  burning crosses gravel you know i we said this in interviews an interview for stuff magazine because a 
[00:14:30]  lot of a lot of uh comedians and whack jobs come from long island musicians and we just you know  it's just a boring place and you just have to find stupid things to keep yourself uh preoccupied  things to do i think that's why so many artists as far as music and comedy and movies and stuff they  do come out of long island because they have to find something something else to do because there's  nothing to do out there it's all just strip malls and strip malls and strip malls so then what 
[00:15:00]  happens is bad traffic everywhere yeah it's awful nothing really to do nowhere to really go you get  people that go a little crazy and they start doing stupid stuff like throwing turkeys out their cars  i grew up on long island i know i've done some really stupid stuff growing up and uh if you're lucky  nothing happens if you're unlucky you get arrested for uh almost killing a woman with a frozen turkey  you know how many times i i gotten my 69 my old 69 nova with my friends and and just plowed into 
[00:15:30]  garbage pails uh people put outside they got blow up mailboxes all that fun stuff oh we used to take  the baseball bats to the mailboxes yeah out of your car window get the m80s and blow up uh the mailbox  of the nerd in your high school we go into uh uh shopping center parking lots and grab onto the  shopping cart yeah and crank that thing up to about 70 miles an hour oh yeah jam on the brakes yeah  whatever it hits i don't know could have been a person you know if you're unlucky you just don't 
[00:16:00]  think of stuff but now they're throwing frozen turkeys or or a few guys there it's nothing new  though this is nothing new it just they got unlucky that could have been a night where they threw a  turkey out it could have ran ran off the road not hit anything hit a door of a car and like piss  somebody off and that was the extent it went to and uh they they'd have been fine but you know one  ever thinks about consequence you know what the latest thing on long island is um  they they burned a cross on a lawn yeah do you think the clan has uh infiltrated the uh cozy little 
[00:16:30]  long island uh or or you think it was just stupid kids again it's probably stupid kids stupid kids  and obviously you know because i don't want anyone coming at me obviously very very wrong to be crossing  uh to burning to burn crosses in the year 2000 it's just wrong okay it was right what year was it  right uh 19 no in his day and age listen it's just wrong we know that but i mean these these 
[00:17:00]  whoever did this a bunch of wimps yeah i'm just comparing it to the old days that's all the old  days and i'm gonna say it again this is very very wrong we understand that i don't need your stupid  letters are you talking about the church thing or uh no this because i just have an observation this  this cross is like is it's like three feet high that's it yeah it's three feet by two feet by two  feet like a couple of fence pickets that they kind of nailed together it's so obvious that uh they took 
[00:17:30]  the hammer let it and ran in a panic okay i know they didn't even get the whole thing on fire they got  like the bottom of it yeah they didn't even really commit in the old days the clan would come to your  house with the freaking uh railroad tires railroad tires and they would be big uh uh telephone poles  they would be building the cross on your front lawn in front of you it may take a day day and a half  they would even stop for lunch and come back later come on out boy right you gonna see something here 
[00:18:00]  boy right they you know they had balls these whoever did this a bunch of wimps they did burn the cross  but you're missing something they are an interracial couple oh oh okay so that makes it right jimmy  no no no just saying just pointing that out so this week we're going to be racist last week we  were gay and this week we're going to be racist oh how about this the boy who threw the turkey  through the window she worked for a collection agency so fine shot young man smash that bitch right 
[00:18:30]  in the face with a frozen turkey but that's the difference i mean back then they hung out on your  lawn got the job done the right way i don't think there's really any organized uh hate crimes going  on on long island you know like when they see a swastikas painted on uh synagogue or on someone's  house it's never the clan or uh an american nazi movement it's stupid kids don't be kids right  don't be stupid ass kids with a can of spray paint going what do you want to do hey some jew living up 
[00:19:00]  the road you want to spray paint all right and then they do it and they're stupid and is it a hate  crime yeah i guess it's a stupid crime but it's it's just like you know it's worse because it  affects somebody personally but it's it amounts to throwing an egg at a house toilet papering a house  it's kids being idiots you know what i did as a kid i used to remember those sneakers that had like 
[00:19:30]  the rubber half moon thing over the toes when you're a kid uh oh yeah yeah yeah okay uh i would  draw a swastika on those on the tips of my sneakers you probably didn't even know what it meant and go  to school you're absolutely right i had no clue it you know what it was you know what a swastika is  to kids that don't know what it means it's a cool looking symbol it's kind of weird cool looking when  you're a kid you know i did that a jewish teacher at the school like laid into me do you know what 
[00:20:00]  that means and i said no i have no clue what that means and then he proceeds to tell me and you're  you're dopey kid it didn't mean i i'm goose stepping with my little swastika sneakers you were just a  stupid kid i saw it from long island probably saw it when i was watching an episode of combat  at home yeah and i thought it was cool to put that on watching rat patrol and uh that's a cool  little symbol didn't the swastika uh mean something else before the nazis yeah the asians had it for 
[00:20:30]  quite a while and it was a symbol of peace right okay but it's been used a few times over with a few  little variations all over the world but yeah the nazis really ran with it and kind of ruined it for  everybody didn't they that's sporty white black and red flag and just a little bit yeah so who  wants to play basketball today ah there you go oh my god that video is just amazing i can't get  enough of that video that clip is fantastic i've been watching it all weekend can't get enough of 
[00:21:00]  it the pistons and pacers everyone knows the story by now it's on the front page of every paper in  america thugs well ron artest is now you know a superstar superstar like it or not he's now a superstar  the guy wanted to uh take a break from playing in the nba because he has a rap album coming out  and he wanted to promote that and now not only will he be able to promote the album because he's  he's done for the season everyone knows who ron artest is and this freaking thing is going to sell 
[00:21:30]  like crazy that's what's nuts about our culture and he's a gangster they're all got some street  cred they all look like gangsters they are thugs basketball is just wrought with thugs and a thug  mentality it's embarrassing oh i know yeah absolutely what's the common thread between  you probably it's not what you think what do you what's the common thread between the guys that  were involved with this brawl and the vibe awards rap music yeah that's it yeah so i i mean you've 
[00:22:00]  seen the video it just he just lost his mind i mean i don't blame him you know someone's throwing  something at you but you know oh yeah that guy in the crowd what a shot what a lob did you see the  one camera angle they had where they just showed him in slow motion they showed him do this underhand  arcing lob and it hit him right in the chest he's laying on that table all bad that was such a  sarcastic way to say look i'm cool i'm relaxing laying on the table like that and then he gets hit 
[00:22:30]  lost his mind and ran and winds up grabbing the wrong guy in the stand he ran by the guy that  actually ran by because it was the guy with the hat right the head and then he grabbed the guy in  a black shirt who just his face looked like mommy i just wanted to go to the game and then the guy  with the hat grabbed uh our test grabbed him from behind and uh then it was just all over there was  no bringing back any civility to that scene you guys might have forgot you why didn't he take that 
[00:23:00]  anger out on ben wallace who's right that he's a faggot he runs up and he hits some little guy in  the stands and he doesn't belt i was showing them by the neck i was showing anthony a picture of ben  wallace today i go what would you do if you saw this come running at you where's that picture again  the picture i'm sure it's in your local paper too i'm like what the f would you do and it goes uh run  as fast as i can run away there but for some reason there doesn't seem to be discipline in  basketball although there was this big football fight too uh yeah the same day the same day the 
[00:23:30]  college football fight but yeah college i'm not punching each other with helmets on i mean that's  nuts that's that's just steroid rage ridiculous but professional sports there's a certain you know  attitude you're supposed to have with professional sports gets very competitive and stuff but you know  to to run into the stands like that and take out a dopey fan that's throwing something at you  you're supposed to blow that off because i'll tell you he's he's made a few people a lot of money 
[00:24:00]  in those stands that one guy that he grabbed that it was obvious he had nothing to do with it right  what a lawsuit that guy's got my god i hope you sell a lot of rap albums there pally yeah because  you're gonna be doling out some cash and then people that weren't even affected there was one father  that was shielding his young daughter's eyes from the horrible scene there's a lawsuit right there  everyone in the stands is gonna sue and why not i think they're gonna play the next game 
[00:24:30]  uh with no with no fans really oh yeah when those two teams get together again i think it's gonna  look like a prison game they can't they can't take a chance nope nobody in the stands and it is in  detroit you know jesus or right outside what about the guy that was in the front row that just  decided to get in on the accident he's going like punch for punch for a while with uh who punched him  out i don't even know that was the other guy with the headband on yeah yeah fat kid yeah like bob kelly 
[00:25:00]  there was one guy that came out onto the floor to have a little discussion and was just immediately  punched in the face and you gotta just wonder why this idiot would get out of his seat and they're  saying that it was the worst fight in nba history i i i don't think so well the worst fight not the  worst punch i think you're going to talk about the worst single punch well yeah uh the kermit  washington incident kermit washington of the la lakers yeah he uh he punched rudy tom janovich back in 
[00:25:30]  1977 and just completely shattered his jaw and i think knocked him out cold and i think he was even in  a coma or or or something or a slight coma or something into a coma but the problem was rudy  tom janovich it was an all-out brawl and he was running full speed i don't know where he was  running to i don't know if he was trying to help a teammate across the court or something but he was  just running and kermit washington turned around saw rudy coming out i'm thinking he's he's going to 
[00:26:00]  tackle him or something oh boy and just punched so it's the full force of a punch plus uh running into  the running into it it was one of the if you've never seen the video it's it'll almost make you ill  big gangly guy just fall into the floor like a sack of potatoes oh my god it was unbelievable that  was the worst punch i mean in sports history i think and i'll tell you something oh here it is  you cannot look at the television oh yeah look at that that's great oh just clobbered that little  fatso fat boy in a jersey take this with your fatso what was he holding in his left hand a rally towel 
[00:26:30]  or was that was he it was something like a towel or was he working for the pistons or was he just a fan  i don't know he's just a dopey fan was it was he a towel boy for the pistons like one of those kids  that sit there and i don't know what they're called towel boy towel boy i think i heard the uh whoever  the basketball player was that hit him right before he hit him he said hey get a load of fatso there  so that uh that's uh something else everyone's talking about today just unbelievable video 
[00:27:00]  little fat idiot oh what is he stupid oh stay in your seat sit down his friends will be teasing  about that if you imagine having footage of one of us getting punched in the face how many times  you'd watch that over and over again stop it i'm gonna see voss getting hit like that oh wouldn't  you love that no i think they'll just go flying like you dropped a box of chiclets that was jermaine  o'neal jermaine o'neal i believe uh punched out the fatso a sliding punch to the fat boy yeah um 
[00:27:30]  earl what's up hello hey earl what's up what are you doing up so early it's a long story why do we  i bet it isn't you called earl right he has nothing to add earl what do you have to add about this fight  no i'm just wow just one of the worst things of it well actually it was the best reality tv ever  oh there you go but uh the fat kid that pretty much had it coming to him because he has no business  being out on the floor the other guy he'll probably make a couple of mil just from uh it was funny 
[00:28:00]  because one minute he's cheering really he's he's really cheering then the next second bam he's all  cartes is just all over him hello this is unbelievable commentary i'm we love it i'm speechless  but you called me i'm on the ben did because ben thinks this is great radio to wake you up  ben gets earl on the phone wakes him up puts him on our airwaves to pretty much rehash without 
[00:28:30]  anything new whatsoever what we were just talking about and then ben sits there and laughs because  earl is so bad earl give us something personal entertainment for ben earl give us something  different give us a different little angle on the whole thing well i just think the fans got off  in a weird way they get off the hook because now this poor bastard's got to sit out for a year  poor bastard he ran up and punched the wrong guy he hit the wrong guy don't you think the fans uh are the 
[00:29:00]  the i don't know the loose cog in the whole thing they're the ones that you know you should uh expect  the unexpected from these mutants because you don't know who it is but the professionalism should be  there with the uh with the player i understand but that doesn't give the fans the right to start  throwing stuff i agree hey but look we like we did our first philly thing what three years ago we first  went down to philly and they were throwing stuff at stalker patty she didn't run out and punch  somebody in the face she took her urine all over a superman suit with dignity and walked back that is 
[00:29:30]  an amazing that's an amazing story maybe we'll talk about later no but he well the fat kid who he had  no business being out on the floor because you knew he was going to try to sucker punch him he wasn't really  out on the floor he had like the spike lee seats they have these seats where you're pretty much on  the court which is another ridiculous thing what other sport are the fans right there on the on the  playing surface get them off well there should probably be a wall at this point back to hockey 
[00:30:00]  type thing put the plexiglass up to keep the animals away from each other i mean because spike lee gets  out of gets away with murder half the time this guy's a lot of run on the court now he's he's a fan  that's all he is i don't care if he made a few good movies and a lot of bad ones he's just a fan  when it comes down to it he shouldn't be allowed to jump on the court yelling and screaming at players  and the and the umps refs like to see him get punched wouldn't that be fun no doubt i would love  to see whack i like spike and earl don't say poor ron artest you know the deal the guy um he he want to 
[00:30:30]  take time out uh this year to promote his rap album oh i mean uh this is perfect for him this  is perfect for him you kidding me yeah he'll be on every talk show plugging his album and talking  about how he got screwed by the league throwing down tv cameras onto the floor driving through  people's backyards knocking down mailboxes got a girl in the car that's a man  he punched that fat kid that's an attention getter it sure was an attention getter 
[00:31:00]  oh all right earl um thanks for your um punching a fat boy's baby shit alongside what this dude's  doing well thanks for your insight okay all right get out of here thank you earl steve what's up buddy  there's been a bit of a riot here what's dave no not much how you guys are doing it's great to  have you in detroit um oh you're uh calling from detroit in the city yeah you guys are animals in 
[00:31:30]  that city man you know just what we needed you know we still had the stigma 20 years later burning  down the city after the tigers won the series right you know now we're going to be known as like you  know battle royal city or something like that that was a hell of a scene man well it was you know  it's just those jerk off fans it's finally good to see you know because you always see in hockey  games people throwing stuff over and no one you know gets beat up but it's good to see somebody  finally get it look at that there's an interesting take on it don't be somebody from detroit saying  that it was kind of nice to see a fan get a little bad you know why they don't get beat up in the 
[00:32:00]  hockey games is because these i mean you've seen the policy you know they do try to get to the fans  but they can't get over that glass well there was that one video from like 10 years ago yeah  it showed where the guy was sprained tied domey with a water bottle the glass fell down and then  domey ended up beating the hell out of it oh yeah yeah that was that was a good uh video as well  there's been a few recently hasn't there within the past five years or so where a couple of the guys  have gotten up into the stand but they look so dopey trying to walk up the stairs with the skates on 
[00:32:30]  it's really a little rough you know bring the fan out on the ice and then you'd see some uh  so you have no problem with what happened huh  no i do i do have a problem just because it's us but you know it would have happened if it would  have been in chicago new york l.a well no probably not l.a but i mean any other you know city that  we have a rival with you know be it there or here i'm sure the same thing would have happened if some  moron would have threw a cup but you know i'd like to see a good fight like anybody but it just sucks 
[00:33:00]  that it happened here because we've been stuck with the stigma for so long yeah i think the next game  you guys play in uh detroit with the pacers christmas oh it's christmas christmas day  on mbc that's perfect for the nba we're gonna do it in a cage match put a big cage over the court  the pacers who's not watching that game christmas day oh man mbc you're gonna love it they got colby  and shacket together for the first time that day too wow very cool they are gonna promote it they're 
[00:33:30]  gonna show the video again over and over on christmas day but we're gonna put both teams  in a steel cage now you guys mentioned that the guy that our test first slugged yeah when i threw it  did you see the guy in the blue shirt kind of underhand the cuff to hit him uh-huh if you get  the video watch it the guy he's got a blue ben wallace warm-up jersey on he underhands it and then  he pushes our test into the guy that you know didn't do nothing yeah after our test grabs the guy in  the black shirt that didn't do anything and had the horrified look on his face as he was being hit

[00:57:30]  That's all.  Whoa.  No.  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  No, that was awesome, Sarah.  Let's hear it for Sarah from Oregon.  Excellent.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon.  Sarah, you rock.  That was really, really good.  Did you finish the second one there?  Yes, I did.  I know you did.  All right.  Well, not bad.

Give us a boobie shot, too, all right?  I don't know that I have any.  Oh, really?  Do you have any sexier panties?  Those look like, are those fruit of a loon briefs?  No, those are really cute Victoria's Secret-like boy shorts.  Oh, oh, okay.  I thought maybe they were panties.  No, no.  They're like little boy shorts. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  You can't tell in this black and white picture.  Yeah, I sent a color picture.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I know.  They print them out on this awful black and white paper he'd give us here in the studio  and then we'd see them later in color.  But you should get some kind of, you know, little thong thing or something.  All right.  Well, let's hear it for Sarah.  You did a great job today, Sarah.  Call us back any time when you're lonely and no one wants to bang you, okay?  All right.  All right.  Well, I don't know if she succeeded in becoming the sexiest state in America, but it was still 
[00:59:00]  really, really good.  It was very good and very realistic.  It wasn't faked.  It was hot.  So we'll see what the listeners think.  All right, Anthony?  Can I point out that I'm glad I didn't screw that up with a fart or a gay sound as you  play the Pennsylvania polka?  Yeah.  That I didn't do anything stupid.  No.  See, the difference is, though, we allowed her to do one solo.  That was awesome.  It was hot.  And then I'm trying to make a little radio magic there.  And I think there was a couple of giggles coming from the booth, so I think we succeeded.  It was very funny.  A couple of thumbs up from the booth.  If her dildo sees its shadow when it comes out, we got, what, more winter? 
[00:59:30]  How does that work?  I don't know.  We got to ask Phil Connors.  Phil?  Phil.  Is that Puxatawney Phil?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hate Puxatawney Phil.  All right.  Let's just hate him.  We're going to take our first break, Anthony.  We've been on the air for an hour here.  Oh.  We have three Monster Rain songs.  Jesus.  Three new Monster Rain songs we're going to play next.  It's great.  One is a acoustic Bon Jovi ripoff thing.  Really?  Kind of has that Bon Jovi hair band. 
[01:00:00]  You know when those bands used to go acoustic?  Yeah.  We got one of those.  Then we got a rap version, which I kind of like.  A little hip-hop?  I didn't like it at first, and then it got kind of catchy.  Can we throw some beer at each other and punch each other in the face during it?  Yes, we can.  That'd be nice.  And then we have kind of a poppy version.  Oh, like a pop?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, they're all interesting.  Let's just put it that way.  One is really bad.  One is okay.  One's pretty good. 
[01:00:30]  We'll give them a listen.  As we go to break, Anthony, you two on SNL, Saturday night.  I caught that.  Very good.  Our own Ben was hanging out with Bono.  We'll see what that was all about after the break.  After the break.  Hollywood Ben.  Hollywood Ben.  Very cool.  Yeah, I saw that one.  They did a great job, you two.

[01:06:30]  Although legitimate charities do make phone calls for donations  The Federal Trade Commission warns that not all the calls you receive will be legitimate  One popular scam is from callers claiming to raise money for the Fraternal Order of Police  While some police districts do raise money by telemarketing calls  It is best to check out all charities before making donations  Always ask for a charity's name, address, and phone number before donating  Ask them to send you written information  Then look up the information on the charity yourself  And make sure that the call you received is legitimate  For example, if you get a call from someone claiming to raise money for your local Fraternal Order of Police

[01:09:00]  Thanks for checking us out  We definitely appreciate it  Thanks for turning your friends on to the O.B. and Anthony Show  We appreciate that  Yes, we do  Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done  Thank you  Spreading the virus across America  We got a guy, Anthony  That was at the Pistons game 
[01:09:30]  Oh yeah?  We're going to try to move on  But first, let's say hi to Tom in Detroit  What's up, Tom?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  How you guys doing?  Yo, buck, buck, yo  That's cool, man  I was at that fucking game, man  Now, be honest  How close to the fight were you?  Well, I was on the second tier on the other side  So I wasn't very close  You had a good view of it  Yeah, I had a nice bird's eye view  I was about to fall asleep on my girlfriend's shoulder  Before Ben Wallace pushed the Reinhardt test  I really wish I was close enough to pour a drink on Reinhardt test, man 
[01:10:00]  Fuck that motherfucker, man  Not a big fan, are you?  Yeah, and then news, news  Just showing the children, just crying  Everybody was hyped after the game  Everybody was going, bad boys are back  You know, everybody was just yelling and screaming  And being just rowdy after the pounds  There were no fights  I guess, you know  Nobody was wearing an Indiana jersey after a little while  Oh, could you imagine leaving the arena with your Pistons 
[01:10:30]  Not the Pistons, with the Pacers jersey on?  Oh my God  Oh man, they would have got their ass straight  I swear to you, Reinhardt test is lucky  That the Palisans, Auburn  You know, you got all the white people with suits down there  If the game was like somewhere close to Detroit  Like the Joe Louis Arena or something  Man, it would have been just mayhem  I think somebody would have got shot or stabbed  Some gunfire, yeah  At least a stabbing  I hear you  Alright  How big a guy is Ben Wallace, do you know? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, he's like 6'10", I think  Yeah, he's like 6'9", but he's actually like 6'7", 6'8",  Yeah, but he's just wide  About a solid 260  He looks like a horse, man  I would never get in the way  Oh, I also wish I was that black  That white guy in the black shirt  Because he's going to get millions and millions of dollars  Payday  Yeah, he's got his payday  Oh, yeah  Okay, I don't have much after that  So I'll see you guys later  Alright, thank you  Goodbye, sir  Yeah, he decides 
[01:11:30]  Artest decides he's not going to go after Wallace  He goes after Harry Potter  In the crowd  With his little glasses on  His little shirt  His little black shirt  The skinniest guy he ran at and punched  And he ran  When Ben Wallace was coming after him  He was backing up  He wanted nothing to do with that big fist in his mouth  Anthony from Oceanside  What's up, boys?  Hey  Listen, guys  These monkeys got no respect  Oh, boy  He's not very nice, sir  Ding, ding  Alright, you 
[01:12:00]  But here's the deal  Didn't Wallace just lose his brother a couple weeks ago?  Yeah, he had some kind of death in the family  Oh, really?  So they were saying  Wallace is the biggest gentleman in the NBA  This guy's got to go push him  He's got all this bent-up anger  He's the most soft-spoken player on the court  And he's going to go hack him from the back  He's lucky he didn't chop his fucking head off  Is that very out of character for Ben Wallace?  Absolutely  Okay  Absolutely  The guy speaks the truth  Alright, Anthony, thank you  We're going to try to move on  We got Jim from PA on the line 
[01:12:30]  Head injury guy from last week  Yeah  I don't know where we're at with this  What's up, Jim?  How are you?  Pretty good  For the listeners that might just be tuning in  That haven't heard from Jim from PA  He's a guy  How old are you?  I'm 30 years old  He's 30 years old  When he was 15, I believe it was  He was out on a boat  That his neighbor was driving  And another boat ran up onto the boat they were on  And he was hit in the back of the head 
[01:13:00]  With a boat  Hit in the head with a boat  And it has left him with certain disabilities, I guess  Yeah  So am I right to recall what happened as you were at the mouth of the Nung River  And Air Cav just kind of dropped the boat  And it hit the back of your head?  No  Oh, sorry  Air mobile  Right on his head  So, um, um, hey Opie, I went to the Eagles game yesterday  Oh, you went to the Eagles game?  Yeah  And?

[01:19:00]  He leaves this program to be  The ozone midget sighting of the day  Ah, we go all the way to Colorado and say hi to George  I hope he's just pushing buttons in the middle of the conversation  Well, that's the interrupting part  What's up, George?  Hey, guys  When the midget sightings come, you gotta go to them  Alright  Go ahead, George  Hey, guys  I've got a midget bar fight for you  Alright  Come on  I'm serious, man  On the weekend  I'm a paramedic 
[01:19:30]  And about a week and a half ago  We responded to a call  At this bar down the street from us  And these two guys  These two midgets were in there drinking  And some guy started giving him shit  And the one midget got pissed off  And turned around  And literally head-butted the guy in the nuts  Come on  I am dead serious  I guess the bartender had told the guy to lay off  To leave these guys alone  Yeah  And the guy wouldn't do it  And the one midget  He just 
[01:20:00]  I haven't got all the details from the cops yet on it  But he said, I mean, the cops were laughing so hard  They responded  But this midget  I mean, the guy just turned  And he head-butted this guy in the nuts  And then what did that guy do?  Dropped  I mean, literally  Dropped the guy like a stone  He's the one we took to the hospital  You took the  The normal-sized guy to the hospital  Yeah  We took him to  Well, we ended up taking the one midget to the hospital also  But  He had a slight concussion 
[01:20:30]  Yeah  What it was  Was there was  These two guys were in there together  And the one was drunk  Started handling these midgets  When  One midget ran at the guy  And head-butted him in the nuts  The other guy grabbed the midget  And literally  It looked like  The bartender told the cops  And the cop was telling us  It looked like a midget  Midget tossing  Very good  He literally picked him up  And threw him into  Threw him up against the wall 
[01:21:00]  I find this hard to believe  I am  Serious with you guys  I would not  Okay  The cops responded  We're laughing so hard  They couldn't  They had a hell of a time  Trying to call it in  It's not that preposterous  A midget head-butting a guy's bag  I mean  That's sick of having  Just two midgets in one place  Is kind of odd  Yeah, it really is  What fantasy land was this?  Not really  You've got to think  They hang out together  I would think midgets  Search out other midgets  Absolutely  Yeah, but they're so few  And far between  It's kind of hard to hook up 
[01:21:30]  With another midget  What about the progeria kids?  They find another progeria kid  To hang out with  Those progeria kids  Midgets find each other  In a world of knees  And pants  Actually, there's quite a few  Of them out here  In Colorado  In the Denver area  I wonder why  Maybe that's the haven  For midgets  I don't know  It's just  There's quite a few  Of them that live out here  What is it?  I know it's the high altitude  It makes them feel  Slightly taller  They don't look at height  With like 5'4  They look at sea level 
[01:22:00]  I'm towering over  The rest of the country here  Wonderful  Wow  A lot of midgets  In Colorado  Who knew?  Yeah  Like I said  There's quite a few  Of them out here  I just thought  It was so funny  I mean  When we got the call  And we responded  Maybe because  There's so much snow  In Colorado  Skiing  They have that low  Center of gravity  They probably ski very well  I'm thinking  With all the snow  It's like  Oh wow  He's just walking  Through a couple  Feet of snow  Alright 
[01:22:30]  Well thank you George  Hey no problem  Bye man  Alright  Meanwhile  Back at the show  I didn't mean to interrupt  But that's what  The breaking midget  Siding thing is all about  It just breaks in  It just breaks in  I don't know  When it's coming  Like a Fox news alert  Exactly  I forget what I was  Going to ask  Oh for Pete's sake  Ah  It's alright  So  And the Pergeria kids  Get in one spot  Because it's always  Like the Maury show  And their parents bring them  It's not like  Just a midget  Being dropped somewhere  And  You know  I can't see midgets 
[01:23:00]  Really hooking up  I think they hook up  Kind of hard  I think they have  Socials and all sorts  Of things going on  You think there's  A whole midget  Nightlife  Network I do believe  Underground  Where it's just  Midgets going to  Like parties  And bars  I watched Elf  Yesterday morning  Yeah  And the midget fight  In that movie  With Will Ferrell  I didn't see it  You've never seen Elf  No  Oh my god  I was laughing so hard  Because now every time  You see a midget  You think of the radio show  And the midget sightings  And there's a scene  Where the midget beats up 
[01:23:30]  Will Ferrell  In the conference room  It's hilarious  Absolutely hilarious  That was actually not a bad movie  I enjoyed that  Oh you saw that one  Wow  Jimmy likes a movie  I like a lot of movies  I just  Not a lot of new ones  Alright  You guys want to get  Into the monster rain thing  Or do you want to talk  About the stupid hunters  This is amazing  That's how white people  Kill each other  By the way  Yeah  See black guys  Can go knifing  And you know  Beating each other up  And stuff  But white people  We know how to get  The job done  As far as killing people 
[01:24:00]  Randomly go  Yeah there's definitely  A difference between  Black people killing  And white people killing  Definitely  Well here it is Anthony  It comes out of Wisconsin  Five  Five  Slain and deer hunter feud  Five  Five  Because they're armed  It's amazing  Listen what they were  Fighting over  A fight among deer hunters  Over a tree stand  You're in my tree stand  You know  They get those tree stands  Like I don't know  10-12 feet off the ground  Well sometimes lower  I don't know  They sit in there  And they sit in there 
[01:24:30]  All morning long  And all that  They cover themselves  With deer piss  Right  And then wait  Wait for a deer  To come by  And then blast them  From the tree stand  They spend hours  And hours  And hours  Up in these things  And there's certain  Stands that are  In very good spots  Like where deer  Come to walk by  To get to the water hole  Or eat  Or something  So they're very coveted  To these hunters  Ugh  Just a bunch of  Dickheads sitting in a thing  Waiting for some animal  To walk by  So they can shoot  It just really annoys me  Just in camo  Yeah 
[01:25:00]  Ugh  Gonna outfox them  Yeah it bugs me  Well there's five less hunters today  Good  A fight among deer hunters  Over a tree stand  Wound up leaving five people dead  And two others critically injured  Officials said yesterday  And I'm hearing now  There's more coming out  On this story  That more people could have died  But the guy ran out of ammo  Really?  This is what I'm hearing  The deadly violence began  Shortly after a hunting party  Saw other hunters  Occupying their tree stand  Alright now you come up  To your tree stand  That you're all psyched  To get into  And shoot some deer  And you see 
[01:25:30]  It's taken by some other hunters  So what do you do?  A fight broke out  Between the two sides  And shootings followed  Wait isn't this  The Pistons Pacers thing?  You don't want to fight  When everyone is armed  With high powered rifles  You don't want to fight starting  Alright  But the incident  Didn't deter other hunters  In the area from hunting  We're all old  Died in wool hunters  Said 72 year old Bill Wagner  We wouldn't go home  Because of this  But we will keep it 
[01:26:00]  In our minds  Wait wait  He won't go home  Because  Well other hunters  In the area  Oh in the area  Everyone  You know  The news spread  And wow  There's five people dead  In blah blah area  Over there  But I don't care  I'm going to continue  Hunting anyway here  I guess it was  A good deer stand  If he was able  To pick off five of them  And they didn't hit him  He had the high ground  I don't know  If it's one guy  Or if  That's the story  I read in the other paper  It said it was one guy  One guy  One guy  That did the shooting  Lost his effing mind  I don't know  If you guys have heard  The update though  It wasn't a guy actually 
[01:26:30]  It was actually a deer  In an orange cap  And he suckered people in  And just shot them  Bambi's got a gun  Yeah that's  Bunch of hellbillies  It happens  It usually happens  Accidentally though  Every year you hear  You know  They're walking  Through the woods  And tripped  Oops  Rifle hits the ground  Or they're  I like the one  Where they  They saw something move  And thought it was a deer  And it winds up  Being the guy's son  And  Well it's usually 
[01:27:00]  Something you hate  It's just a great excuse  To kill somebody  I thought I was  Shooting at a deer  I was so into guns  Still am  I love guns  I love shooting guns  At targets and stuff  I'm not  I'm not the hunter guy  I know what you mean  I always feel  I like you know  Making big bombs  Dressing in trench coats  Going to school  You know  I just like guns  Lay in the back of your car  With a little hole  Cut in the trunk  Yeah that too  Sure  Sure  Driving on Washington  Sitting and just waiting  Hi boo boo  Just take a few pot shots 
[01:27:30]  We were  We used to  When I lived in California  All of my wacky stories  By the way  Come in California  Come from California  We were out in the Mojave Desert  We used to go out in the desert  And just camp  Me  My father  Brother  These  Other families  That we used to hang out with  All Mexicans  The Reyes family  How old were you  When you got your first gun  Oh uh 
[01:28:00]  It was my 12th birthday  Yeah 12th birthday  I got a uh  What the hell did I get  Nice little Ruger  Six shooter  Western style  Wore it on the hip  Nice  Low slung holster  You walked around  With a loaded gun at 12  Uh  12, 13  Around there  It was  It was  Because we used to ride  Ride fence  They called it  Ride fence  We had about  3,500 acres  Or 35,000 acres  Uh  That had  Cattle on it  And I used to have to ride 
[01:28:30]  The  The  Barbed wire fence  And then  Patch it up  Because the motorcycle guys  Used to come through  And cut the fence  And uh  When you're up there  In that  I was fully armed  Had a uh  A Winchester 30-30  On  In the  Scabbard  And had my little  My little six shooter  On my hip  A little skinny Anthony  On a horse  With a  With a little gun  Motorcycle guys  Never screwed with me  Why would they cut the fence  Uh  To get their motorcycles through  They would cut the fence 
[01:29:00]  And then  Continue on the way  Because it was like  Great motocross up there  But you know  Then all of a sudden  Your cattle gets out  So I was armed  To the teeth  And uh  It was fun  You know  Shooting cactus  And rattlesnakes  And stuff like that  We went out  To Mojave Desert  Where we also had  Dune buggies  Guns  And tequila  And uh  We were a bunch of kids  Just drinking and shooting  It was really  Eh  But thank god  Everyone was safe  Oh wait  No  Everyone wasn't safe  I'm so bummed  I never got to meet  Your father man  Oh he was insane 
[01:29:30]  He sounded like  An unbelievable guy  He was a madman  It was a  It was a  No parenting whatsoever  No  Gotta love it  It was a carnival  I'll tell you though  As a guy  Between like  Thirteen  And seventeen years old  It was the place to be  I was gonna say  Perfect right  No responsibility  And just all  Excitement  Adventure  And fun  Whatever you wanted to do  One day he just went out  And bought a dune buggy  You know  Some days there wasn't food to eat  But  He had a god damn dune buggy 
[01:30:00]  And it was a pisser  You know  You're driving that thing around  You're fourteen years old  Wheeling around a dune buggy  Went out into the desert  Guns everywhere  We're all wearing guns  And uh  This one kid  Why would you go out to the desert  Just to party  And uh  Ride the dune buggies  Yeah  Just to spend about a week  Ten days  Shoot at targets maybe  This guy Juan Reyes  Had a silver mine out there  It was uh  An old  Like from the forties  A silver mine  But it had a little mining shack  And we used to just camp out there  And shoot and drink  And you know  Hang out  And drive the dune buggies around 
[01:30:30]  And uh  This guy Juan Reyes  Had this old six shooter  And it was the type  That had no real safety on it  The firing pin was directly  On the hammer  That you cock back  Sure  And the new ones  Don't have that  The trigger has to be pulled  And the hammer has to fall  The old ones  If the hammer fell  And the trigger wasn't pulled  It still went off  And worse yet  You had a quarter cock it  Which is kind of  Pull the hammer back  To load it  Because you had to  Spin the cylinder around  So he's putting the bullets in  The thing's quarter cocked 
[01:31:00]  You ever hear  Go off half cocked  That's kind of what it means  Okay  Don't go off half cocked  He's loading it up  He raises this thing  The hammer falls  It's pointing right at his  Eight year old son  Boom  Bullet goes right in his  Left shoulder  Above his heart  And right out the back  I'm standing right there  I'm looking right at the kid  When it hits him  How close were you to the kid?  I was about  As close as I am to you right now  About four feet away 
[01:31:30]  Wow  So I'm looking  And I happen to be  Looking at him  When this happened  Hits him right there  He turns immediately white  This tube  It looked like a  Plastic tube of blood  Came out  It was shaped  Perfectly round  Like a water fountain  Came shooting out  Of his  What I thought chest  I didn't even know  It was his shoulder  Because it was  Close to his heart  Comes shooting out  He goes  Like uttered something  And fell right down  To his knees  I'm like  Holy shit 
[01:32:00]  I just saw  His father kill  His son right there  And the father  Just lost his mind  Meanwhile  Didn't you say  The blood just kind of  Like started  It did  Like a tube  It came pumping out  I'm sorry  I was thinking of something  It just went like  Whoosh  Whoosh  Whoosh  So the father's like  Oh my god  Like everyone just  Freaked out  It was a hell of a scene  To be part of  Is this in the woods now  Oh let me tell you  Where we were  Grab a little map people  This was  Between Barstow California  And Needles Arizona 
[01:32:30]  There's a little  Old highway  That runs between it  And we were  50 miles in  On dirt roads  Off the highway  50 miles in  Before you get  To the highway  That takes you  Another whatever it is  To Barstow or Needles  They decided to go  To Needles  Arizona  To go to the hospital there  But they just  Loaded them up  In the pickup truck  Packed ice on them  Wrapped it up  And took off  And  Hours later  I mean  10  12 hours later 
[01:33:00]  The cops came back  To do a little investigation  Because it was a shooting  They came back  With guys that were  Just armed like crazy  Because they had no idea  What was happening out here  A group of guys  In the Mojave Desert  There's a shooting  They're thinking cult  Or something  Yeah they came out  Of those  They had big  Suburbans  And they just came  Out of there  Like  You know  Everybody come out  Of the mining shack  Everyone please  Come out of the mining shack  We want to see  Everybody's hands  Did a little investigation  Little Charlie Reyes  Lived  It was in his shoulder 
[01:33:30]  And  That was  That was that  But I was  The first and only time  I ever saw someone get shot  Thought he was dead too  That looked like  Just a heart shot  What'd you do  After that  Did you just run away  And hide  Cry  I mean  What'd you do  It was  Like we were all shaken  Like freaked out  So we went in  And just did massive shots  Of tequila  You're 12  Yeah  No I was  I think I was 13  Or 14  Or something  Alright  But yeah  That makes it better  When did you lose touch  With Charlie Reyes  When I came back to New York 
[01:34:00]  Probably about  17 years old  And you never saw him again  No I saw him  Not since then  No  But he was fine  You know  He had a little brace on him  And it went in  And right out  It was a 22  So it wasn't like a 38  Take his little  Little 8 year old arm off  But to see a little  8 year old kid  Just like hit his knees  And go  Like he said something like  Holy shit  That kid just got shot  If you slow it down  It was probably  Hey I'm shot  You dumb wetback  Holy shit 
[01:34:30]  You ever see a fucking head  Come upon like that  Hey we worked him over  With the butt of the shotgun  Made him hop around  On one foot  That's how the gook laughs  Hey go get that  Big hairy creepy crawler  From the ammo dump  And put it on  His gunshot wound  And the cops came through  Went through some paperwork  Said no this is important  This is important  And then it blew up  Y'all love little Charlie Reyes 
[01:35:00]  Hey Jim what's up  Charlie Reyes was a water walker  She's probably the one  That did fucking Charlie Reyes  Through the whole mining camp  For Charlie  And Sal  Jesus I got nothing  Of all that  Good luck Jim 
[01:35:30]  Go ahead  You missed an important part  Of the story  Well wait  Which story  Anthony's story  Or the hunting story  I don't think you were there sir  I'm 20 minutes late  But fucking  The guy in Wisconsin  Who killed everybody  Right  Oh the hunter  That killed five  His name is Chai Vang  He's a chink  Oh really  He's the only chink  In Wisconsin  Oh  A chink  You just panicked  I guess  I think it's an Asian  Yeah sir  Asian American sir  I don't think we need  The racial epithets  Who the fuck  Are you kidding  This is Boston 
[01:36:00]  After all  Anthony  Come on  It is Boston  Let them be racist  Who the fuck  Are you kidding  It's in their blood  Let them be  Jesus  You're not going to  Convince this guy  Is there an area  For the Chinese  Up there in Boston  No  Yeah New Hampshire  Push them all up there  Because I know  There's the Italian area  The north end  And then there's  Saudi for the Irish  And then there's  Dorchester and Roxbury  For the blacks  And where do they  Keep their Asians  In Boston  To keep them away  From the regular  God fearing white people 
[01:36:30]  That don't want  Any ethnics around  Them in Boston  No  Well  Chinatown's very small  But they're all  Like in Quincy now  Quincy  Yeah I think  They've all gone to  Quincy  Which is just outside  Of Boston  And Juton  Of course  Juton is where  The Hebrew  Of Massachusetts  Very nice  Very sectioned off  Like a racial puzzle  It's like Billy Burr said  It's organized  That's what they like  Say organized  You know another  Organization liked  The word organized  When talking about  Races  You know  Speaking of Boston  The Shriners 
[01:37:00]  But I thought  I meant the Nazis  Speaking of Boston  Going back  There's something  Coming off  Mitch Kumstein  There's something  Coming off  The instant feedback  Yeah  And we said  We would talk  About this  When we got back  On the radio  Oh really  Remember our  Old pal Psycho Mark  And how he represented  Us when we got fired  On Fox  Do we have that audio  Oh god  Was that funny  What a tool  Can we get a copy of that  Yeah  That's how  The wet back laughs  Yeah  Toolbag Johnson 
[01:37:30]  From New Orleans  Artie from Yonkers  Do you guys remember  After you were canceled  Psycho Mark was involved  In some sort of discussion  On Fox  And at the end of the talk  He did a stern  Hoo hoo hoo  That was classic  Is he coming back at all  But more than the  Hoo hoo hoo  The false information  He was giving everybody  Because we weren't talking  We gotta find that today  They put Psycho Mark  In like a dicky suit  It looked like  It looked like a suit  With Velcro on the back  And dressed him up  Put him in front of the camera  And let him do an interview  And interviewed him  About us 
[01:38:00]  I forgot all about that  We gotta find that audio  And play it after break  And he was using  His professional  Psycho Mark voice  He'd come in  Like  Let me tell you  We were up in Boston  Last week  I got fucking cocked  And then you put him  In front of the mic  To do a stack or two thing  Have you talked to your doctor  About stack or two  Yes  I'm here talking  About Opie and Anthony  On Fox News  And he did this thing  And it was all  Bad information  Stuff he had no clue about  I forgot that we haven't  Talked about that  On the radio yet 
[01:38:30]  Because for the last two years  We've been referring to that tape  Over and over again  Amongst ourselves  It's just some of the funniest stuff  Because he had no idea  What he was talking about  He was representing us  And everyone was buying  What he was saying  He had nothing to go on  Right  I know  We'll talk about that next  The JFK game  We got so much to do  Why don't we just take a break here  And regroup  Alright  Cash up niggas  All my niggas in the P  Now right now  Bubby  Hockey  Bubby  Shoot  Shoot

[01:42:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show  Let the party sit and go  Let the party sit and go  Let the party sit and go  Let the party sit and go  Let the party sit and go  Let the party sit and go  Five shots  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  Lots going on today  Old Jimmy Norton has an audition later on today 
[01:43:00]  A little audition for you  Yeah, for  What's that show?  Law and Order?  Law and Order, yeah  CSI  I don't know if it's one of those or not  I'm playing a guy who works in a porn shop  A porn shop?  Yeah, who he finds out when he's selling his child pornography  Oh, there's a reach  Look at you  I'm sure I'll screw it up  It's actually good dialogue  I know  Is it?  How many pages?  Two pages is not much  I have to download it  Pretty good?  Yeah, it's not bad  Can you practice on the show?  That would be hilarious 
[01:43:30]  I thought of that  I stink  But I don't know if I can read their material over the air like that and blow it  I can't do that  Oh, I see, I see  I'll do it afterwards though  Afterwards, we could get the parts  We'll see whoever actually got it and then we'll watch him do it  I'll give my version  And then you should get it  I'm flat  But I don't know where to go  Do you consider yourself a bad actor?  No, atrocious  Do you just try too hard?  I don't know, I just, I'm not natural  My voice goes up like that when I'm acting 
[01:44:00]  I don't talk right  Oh no  You know, hey, where are we going?  Oh, you're that guy?  Yeah, I suck  But I don't enjoy acting that much  It's okay  But I just, I don't have fun with it  I really don't  I like doing stand-up  Why do you go on the auditions?  You know, if you play a guy who's selling kiddie porn  How do you not audition for, you know, like that?  That's such a despicable role  The guy, the casting director actually emailed me  I guess he knows me  And he's like, I would like to have you come in for this  Which is kind of nice of you being tight-casted  Maybe you already have it  And it's just technicality  Yeah, I'll blow it, believe me  I'm off  Yeah, I'm atrocious  I don't care  Every comic thinks you're a great actor 
[01:44:30]  Most of us are okay  That's true  I don't understand why so many comics want to go into acting  Or think that that's their progression  That they should go into acting  Because most of them really stink  Well, I'll tell you why we think that  250 million, Seinfeld  It's a nice goal to have  Okay  Ray Romano, 40 million  And Seinfeld can't act worth a shit  You watch the show, it's hysterical  One of my favorite shows ever  And he's laughing his way through every line  He can't talk to any of the other characters  Without looking at that dopey grin on his face  It's just a perfect show for him 
[01:45:00]  And he had the same face all the way to the bank  Yeah, exactly  Some comics are good  Jamie Foxx is a great actor  I mean, Jim Carrey's a very good actor  Now, Jamie Foxx, all of a sudden  Is getting accolades because of Ray  I liked him in Ali as Bondini  He was great  That's the character's name, right?  Bondini, the trainer  Oh  He was in Ali  I don't remember  Oh, he was great  But, yeah, him, now everybody's giving  Oh, Oscar  Here comes the Oscar 
[01:45:30]  I don't think it was that good  Eddie Murphy?  Could have been  Here's my problem with Murphy  I think he could have been a better serious actor  But he always took the comic role  Like Pryor at least did Blue Collar  He did Lady Sings of the Blues  Richard Pryor did real serious roles  Eddie Murphy in 48 Hours was great  Yeah, he was very funny  But I mean  But that wasn't even a total comic role  You know  That had some drama to it  I'd like to see him take a real drama role  Like with no humor  Like Pryor did with Blue Collar  Where he was almost nominated for Lady Sings of the Blues 
[01:46:00]  In I think 72  So I would love to see that  I liked Brewster's Millions myself  Yeah, but that was a little too heavy  That's awful  They gave him some bad roles, man  That was some real bad movies  I liked him in Car Wash  Car Wash was a good movie for the 70s  I mean, with Carlin was in it  Yeah  Franklin the Jai  Yeah  And how about Sir Crazy  He's one of the funniest movies ever  That's a great movie  Great movie  Alright, you want to play some Monster Rain songs?  Oh, who doesn't want to hear some more Monster Rain songs?  Come on  I feel bad for the people that have just turned on their XM satellite radios 
[01:46:30]  You missed a lot of great programs  They're going to have to  More on the way, obviously  But this Monster Rain thing  Taking on a life of its own still  They're going to have to listen over the holiday weekend  And Doug Out Doug  Who gave us the Monster Rain song last week  That we didn't really like  On the instant feedback  Watch out, guys  Love on the Porches  Developing an underground following  Really?  We're going to have to post all these Monster Rain songs on Foundry  I think most of them are up there  Most of them are probably up there  Pretty quick with that  You go to our website  OpianAnthony.com  And there you have it 
[01:47:00]  But we have three new ones today, Anthony  I don't know if you want to play them all the way through  No, I heard one  And I don't think it deserves being played all the way through  It deserves enough to be goofed on  Alright, Mike Cerboni, that one  You know something?  These guys send these songs in  They've got to understand  Some of them are going to be huge hits  And we will talk about them and laugh  And play them again and again  And other ones  We're going to get a quarter way through  And go, your song blows  Some of them don't follow the rules you need to follow 
[01:47:30]  For a song parody  Some people try to disguise their original music  By saying it's a song parody  And they just replace the words with something  And it's like their own original composition  That idea stinks  So, for the new people out there  Monster Rain is a little thing Jimmy used to do when he was a kid  He used to blow the neighborhood children when it rained  Under the porch  That's quite an exaggeration  I really don't care for your embellishments 
[01:48:00]  I just want to throw it out there real quick  That's basically what happened, right?  No  Well, yeah, alright  In a nutshell, I can't say you're totally wrong  It did involve little Jimmy and a cock in little Jimmy's mouth  But what happened is when I was a very little boy  For those of you just tuning in  Very young boy  My friend and I would be walking around my apartment complex in Edison  And one of us would yell, monster rain  And we would run under the porch  To hide from the fictional monster rain  And while we were under the porch  What do you do when waiting for a, you know, fictional rain to cease? 
[01:48:30]  You suck each other's dicks  Just what we would do  It was the next logical thing  Looking back, though  I do suspect that monster rain was an excuse  Just to get under the porch  In hindsight, I now see that  But it was okay because you were really young, right?  Yeah, we were little kids  I mean, we were so old  Probably first grade  Eighteen?  No, no, no  I was eighteen  He was seven  No, we were both in, like, first grade  First grade  All right  We didn't even have any hair on our niggles  That's enough  I mean, the original explanation's great  I think we're going to replay it when we take a couple days  Yeah  That was kind of a quick one  Thursday and Friday of this week 
[01:49:00]  So that's the quick  I got it out there  Well, I just blurted it out  How about monster rain?  It just kind of sandbagged me on the air  So I had to fess up to it  There you have it  All right, so this is Mike Cerboni  We'll stop this  I don't know if we can play all of this, Mike  I'm sorry, Mike  It kind of has that Bon Jovi going acoustic thing  Sounds like an 80s song  Ooh  Kind of Eagles, too  Bad Hotel California  Yeah  Or Suck It Easy  Big, long intro for a parody 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, not good  You don't have to go, like, eight  You can go four  And then pop into the song  All alone, he would wait  Sent him by the phone  Waiting for a friend to call  Someone he could hold  At the end of every day 
[01:50:00]  He needed his escape  This sucks  Richie Redwood is  This sucks  For little Jimmy Terrain  Hello  Hello  It's getting kind of cloudy  There's a good chance  It might rain  What?  It's getting cloudy  Looking for a place to hide  And play his little game  Little Jimmy  Little Jimmy  Little Jimmy 
[01:50:30]  That's the monster  Oh  Little Jimmy  It's like Warrant  Yeah  Little Jimmy  Little Jimmy  That's the monster  So Warrant  Warrant  Every road  Has its gone  Poison  Alright, are we done with this one?  Just like  Every cowboy  Sings us  Yeah, please  I like the chorus, though  Oof  No, you don't 
[01:51:00]  That we're all there  So  I'm really starting  The truth  Dude  What did you  What were you thinking?  And hang out  Your little  Ah, Jimmy  Spelt his coffee  He spelt his coffee  You bitch  I was pointing at Steve's Aussie shirt  And I just got excited  Oh, it's an Aussie Jaws shirt  I think I remember  Where he bought that  It was Ozfest  Ozfest in Philly  In Philly  That's cool, man 
[01:51:30]  Alright, well  Mike Saboni  Put some flames on it  No, right  Mike Saboni  Is that who did that?  Yeah  Nice try, though, Mike  Nice try  You know  His little  What did he do?  That home studio  Sounds it  Buried in Echo  And a little  12-string guitar  Little Bon Jovi  It's really bad  Why did he go with  The 80s thing?  Why not?  Song parodies  They're supposed to  Parody another song  Yeah, that was an original  That was like  An original 80s  We got the 
[01:52:00]  Psycho Mark thing  Awesome  Alright  We got a lot of  Things to do today  The next one, Anthony  Is from  Chemistry  Spelled  K-H-E-M-I-S-T-R-Y  You know where  This is going, right?  Sounds good  It's gonna be a rap song  From Whack Bag  The official  Not the official  But the unofficial  Why do we say unofficial?  It's just an  Opie and Anthony  Message Board  Whackbag.com  They do a great job  Over there  And they stayed  Through the whole  Time off  They stayed up  They sure did  This song's called  Jimmy Says 
[01:52:30]  From Chemistry  At first  Jimmy Says  At first I'm like  What is this crap?  And then it kind of  Goes on you  A little hip hop  A little hip hop  Check it out  No?  Ah  There we go  I don't know  Hold on  Here we go  So far so good  Yep  Ominous  Monster music  Yeah 
[01:53:00]  Get your cock out  Jimmy says  Get your cock out  Put my cock in your mouth  Put your face south  While we're under the house  Jimmy  Crawl under the porch  Yeah I said it  Crawl under the porch  The monster rain's coming  The sky's gray  My pants down  Two kids helping each other  Under the damn house 
[01:53:30]  Y'all know the game  Monster fucking rain  It ain't a damn thing  Change  Y'all under the porch  Your friend fellates you  Crawl under  As two digits  Masturbate you  I alleviate the stress  With a cock caress  I explode on my friend's neck  With a monster mess  Just two little toys  No need for vagalube  Stuck on a little crotch  With a slight lack of pubes  We gotta keep it quiet  Make sure mom don't find out  I'll finish you off quick  So I can pull mine out  It's just a little pleasure  With a lot of shame  Who cares  I gotta blame it all  On the monster rain 
[01:54:00]  Get your cock out  Jimmy says  Get your cock out  Put my cock in your mouth  Put your face south  While we're under the house  Jimmy  Crawl under the porch  Yeah I said it  Crawl under the porch  The monster rain's coming  The sky's gray  My pants down  Two kids  Helping each other  Under the damn house  Jimmy Norton  Get your cock out  Jimmy Robinson  Get your cock out  Angelo  Get your cock out  Everybody  Get your cock out 
[01:54:30]  What do you think?  I think that's the fine new rap song  By Ron Artest  It was great  At first  At like 5 in the morning  And we were like  Then we heard it again  We're like  You know this thing  Grows on you after a while  I went and kicked in  Get your cock out  That's pretty good  Throw in a Jimmy Robinson reference  So that's chemistry  K-H-E-M-I-S-T-R-Y 
[01:55:00]  From whackbag.com  Very good  He broke the rule  With the original  That's an original composition  But it was good  He pulled it off though  Maybe because it's  It's not an 80s song  Right  And then we have  The final one for today  That guy brought one in too  Who's this young lad outside?  He's so confident  In his Monster Rain song  He came by personally  To drop it off  Wow  Ballsy  What is going on?  We didn't even request  These songs really  There's been a bunch of them  Yeah the listeners  Just taking it upon themselves 
[01:55:30]  To make the show  More gooder  We love when you do that  Yep  Alright here's the last one  Well no we'll see  What that guy's  Is all about too  Get your cock out  Yeah I'll be singing that  All day  Of course  Get your cock out  All right this is from Matt  Just says Matt  M-A-T or M-A-T-T  Shut up  I almost answered you  The song's called  Playing Anthony  Playing  You'll recognize the song  This is done to  Oh okay  Obviously  Help  If everybody had a porch 
[01:56:00]  Across the USA  Then everybody'd be playing  The game of Monster Rain  You'd see them dropping their trousers  You know we can't abstain  A bushy bushy young scrotum  Playing Monster Rain  You'll catch me sucking off Jimmy  We're sucking all damn day  But just because we like blowing 
[01:56:30]  That doesn't make us gay  All over my t-shirt  And oozing down the drain  Everybody is playing  Playing Monster Rain  We're taking off our tighty whiteys  Here in the pouring rain  We're waxing down our members  And f***ing out our brains 
[01:57:00]  All under the front porch  We're gonna leave a stain  Tell the teacher we're playing  Playing Monster Rain  Imagine Jim going to his mom  Mom going outside to play Monster Rain  Monster Rain  Okay Jimmy have fun  So Monster Rain  If the rain hit you  Something bad would happen  So you'd have to get out of the rain  Right?  Drink out of this  It's an antidote for Monster Rain  Help!  I'm here  The doctor's here  Wow 
[01:57:30]  What a sick twisted little  Classic  Little boy  Playing Monster Rain  There you have it  Matt  I like that one too  Not bad  Not bad  I think we got two really good ones today  That reminds me of the Beach Boys though  Why?  I don't know  Something about it  By the way  That wasn't an original  The rap song  I know  I'm reading that  Yeah the rap song is  Cover of the  Or at least the music used  Is by Pharoah Mosh  And I am so glad 
[01:58:00]  I didn't know that  Yeah I didn't either  The interns told me  Alright  Which intern knew it?  Derek  Could that guy hang out  We'll get to him in a little while  With another Monster Rain song  Get your cock out  Alright good  Not bad  Alright why don't we take a break  Get your cock out  I know that's  That's kind of catchy  Yeah  In a really bad way  I know you don't want to be singing that  You don't want to be walking around  Get your cock out  Down 57th Street after the show  Get your cock out  It is kind of  What?  It sure is  Alright  Yeah we got the Psycho Mark audio next 
[01:58:30]  And we still have to talk about the  Dangerous Toys  Half-Life 2  We have the JFK game  JFK game  41st anniversary of his assassination  I guess you shouldn't call it an anniversary  It is an anniversary though  It's an anniversary  A bad anniversary  Anniversary sounds like something you want to celebrate  But right  Okay  It's not like a good anniversary  Like the Kennedys are all going to get a little cake  And put one candle in it  And the candle blows up  And knocks the top of the cake off  You can see that nice cherry filling 
[01:59:00]  Frosting all over  Like that  Crawl up on the table  And put the cake back  On top of the rest of the cake  So thumbs up or thumbs down  To the YouTube from SNL  Some people liked it  Some people did not like it  I liked the live version  You wanted to go  Alright we'll do another one then  At least he sang it live  I'll say that  Yeah there you go  He was up there singing live  As we go to break  I don't know if there's much to this story 
[01:59:30]  But I was getting text messages from Ben  Seemed like the middle of the night  What time was that?  Like 2 in the morning or something like that?  It was late yeah  Like 2, 2.30 in the morning  Which I don't do that much anymore  If it wasn't a big deal  I know  It wasn't a big deal  I won't do it if it's a big deal  And I texted Norton as well  And I was awake  I was walking over from the cellar  For some reason it comes up as unknown  Whenever somebody texts me  I can't connect to who it is  I don't know why  So I just get this thing  I'm standing next to Bono right now  Yeah  Unknown  I think it was Ben 
[02:00:00]  Oh my god  Okay  I got the actual text message  It was at 3.42 in the morning  It was late  Wow  It was late  It was the Saturday night  And it says  I'm standing next to Bono  With lots of exclamation points  And that's all he says  You should have  You know  Continued the story  I had my camera dude  I would have got pictures  Well he could have got a picture  I mean I didn't have a camera  But he was taking photos with everybody  I called Jim  Because I knew Jim would still be up  So you went to the SNL  After show party  Whatever they call it  How do you get into that?  I went to it  I went to a couple weeks ago  Yeah it's easy  He gets in everywhere dude  It's amazing 
[02:00:30]  I know  That's why he works for the show  The guy's a social butterfly  Yeah it's easy  It's easy  It was cool  But so I walk in  I see  Like holy shit  There's Bono walking through  And you know  So I went over and talked to him  He's a nice guy  I've sat and actually had a conversation  What did you say to Bono?  Nothing really  He was hammered  I was like what's up Bono?  And his poor wife  Because he's so famous  That he can't go  More than like two feet  Everybody  It was just like  Everybody's pulling on him  And he's got his purple glasses on  He's such a little midget too  He's about this tall  He's so small  I've heard he's really short  He's tiny  Like 5'4 tops  Tiny  Tiny 
[02:01:00]  I'd love to get a picture with him  I knew you would  And you could have done it  I could have got you in  You would have wanted one too  I would have wanted  Of course  I would have wanted that picture bad  Yeah I would get one with Bono  Who else goes to the  Saturday Night Live after party?  The cast  The cast?  Bunch of fuckers  It's the same people  You know how it all works  It's the same  No I don't  I absolutely don't know  What it's like to go to  A Saturday Night Live after party  I'd like to on time  We don't do that type of thing  So would I  Because we're not invited  I would like to sit in a corner  And look out of place  Like I do at every one of these  Stupid parties  Remember the magazine party 
[02:01:30]  We went to  Like a few weeks back  Sink  Yeah Sink  It was like VIP  And that was a low key one  But it was  It was one of those  Types of parties  Like all the parties  Are like that  But it's just  Who  Like how much more famous  The people are  That are there  That's the only difference  To any of the parties  It's loud music  From a DJ  No one was wrong with that party?  What?  We were the most famous people there  Which  Yeah that's a problem  Right there  No I'm not even kidding  Because you go to these things  Going wow  I can't wait to meet people  You know 
[02:02:00]  Famous people  Famous people  We were the star attraction  They whisked us into the VIP  And we couldn't get out of there fast enough  Yeah  They whisked us into the VIP section  I sat down in a chair  Or on one of those couch things  With the little one inch by one inch table in front of you  Like everything's too cool and completely impractical  The little table can barely fit your drink on it  But it's a cool little table  The couches are you know groovy 
[02:02:30]  But very uncomfortable  And then they had cell phones that were wired down  That you could use to call the waitresses  To get you drinks  Hello  That's pretty cool actually  Yeah  So you wanted to talk into somebody else's filthy mouthpiece  But the music is just  There's like techno blasting so loud  That you can't even talk to each other  Like Ope was right next to me  And I'm just like  Hey Ope  See this would have been a great opportunity  To actually have some loud techno music  Too late  Don't even try  Look at him in the booth  He's all flustered 
[02:03:00]  He should be  He missed a cue  I know  That was kind of like  You know  He was bummed  He was trying to  Yeah I know  That's okay  That kid works hard  He's great  He's a good kid  He's a good boy  Yeah but you know  The only reason we were there  Was for the free stuff  Yeah yeah  But free stuff  No we hate those things  Yeah it's not like  We were in the magazine  So you know we had to go  Like I would want to go to one  With like a bunch of famous people  Well yeah  Because then you could sit around  And go oh look at that  There's what's his name  You could do a little stargazing  Oh yeah  From that show  Oh my god yeah  Oh I know that guy 
[02:03:30]  Who's in that movie  Hey do you mind if I take a picture  Oh yeah Jim  Hey can I take a picture  Brewer tells a great story  About Nicholson going to one of the SNL parties  Jim Brewer tells  I don't know the story  You don't know the story  But bring it up  No I just think you guys say  You're right I really stink  I'm a turkey through the windshield of fun  I heard Belushi used to have a lot of fun  At those things  Oh recovery night  Yeah  So nothing else on Bono? 
[02:04:00]  No not really  You know  I just I thought it was funny  I knew Jim would want to get a photo  How many people did you have to text message that?  Probably ten  Yeah  Ten at least  I'm so mad that I didn't  I knew you would be  I was like  I had a feeling it was you too  But you gotta call me on those  Just leave me a message  Yeah  Who else would text you with that at that hour?  You don't know  It could be anybody  Bono  I mean anybody I know  So why wouldn't you check it anyway?  You didn't check the text message?  I wound up seeing a friend of mine  No no I did  I sweetie  I checked the message  But it comes up as unknown 
[02:04:30]  For some reason it never registers  Who sent me the text message  He didn't know who it was  That's what he's saying  So you thought someone was just playing with you?  No I think it was one of my friends  I actually thought it might be Ben  But I didn't know  I'm thinking I don't want to call you  You know what it was?  At 4 in the morning  He's sleeping  No no no  No no no  I got it all figured out  Alright I'll tell you if you're right  You were busy doing something else  No you're wrong  Totally wrong  Knowing Bono  I would certainly go  But knowing you  You would at least call Ben back going  Is this for real or whatever  Because you're still up at that time  No problem  I'll tell you why  Because it was so late  Like you said almost 4 in the morning  If it wasn't him 
[02:05:00]  I didn't want to wake  I don't know what he's doing  It was really late  Or he could be sleeping  Or he could be you know  Having his hair fixed  With a hammer  That's what I'm saying  It's Ben  You know he's still awake  He could be standing in front of a fan  With a saw  Fixing his hair  Ben who's the big guy now  Like who's the big star on SNL now?  I don't  I was saying that earlier  I don't know  Horatio  Horatio  Horatio  I guess  Because I guess the old parties  Used to be like  There would be this hierarchy  Like the guys that would get  A lot of air time 
[02:05:30]  Yeah  Would hang out  And be all rowdy and stuff  Does that happen anymore?  Yeah well you know what it is too  There's the actual cast party  And then there's the after after party  So there's like  Which one did you go to?  I went to the cast party  And then I tried to go to the after after party  I knew the doorman at the door  That's where you were shut down?  The cops weren't  It was over the fire code  So I couldn't get in  But the invite was really cool  It was of the U2 iPod  It was like this little flyer  It was pretty badass  Did Bono go to the after after party?  I don't know  Because I couldn't  It was just too much  Too much of a headache  You were at the cast party  Yeah  And it was 345? 
[02:06:00]  No those  They don't start till like 2  It starts late  And they usually keep it going  And then the after after party  Would have to be at what time?  4  4  I get home at like quarter or 5  Was Daryl Hammond there?  He's a friend of mine  No  It's just  It's a lot of people  Name dropper  Daryl?  I like Daryl  I did drop his name  Name dropper  My famous friend  You were busy doing something  I'm telling you  No I wasn't  There's a story there  I'm thinking if Jim's awake at that hour  He's doing something  You're doing something  And you know it was worth a call back to Ben  Because you know he's still awake 
[02:06:30]  And you didn't make that call  So that means you were preoccupied with something  Because it wasn't concrete  It was nothing I could go on there  Oh stop  I'm telling you  I did the cellar  I was done by like 2.30  I wound up eating  I was just walking back to my car to go home  And I got the message  You see that text message  And you're not calling Ben?  I wasn't sure  If I knew it was Ben  I would have called him in a second  Why would I lie?  Why would I  What could he possibly keep secret?  I was helping an old lady across the street  Because knowing you and your celebrity photos  I'm thinking you  No matter what 
[02:07:00]  I didn't know where it was  It could have been somebody in LA I know  Just brag  I didn't know  I know a lot of friends dude  One of them could have just been  Hey I'm standing next to Bono  It wasn't like he said  Come up to 48th Street  Or wherever it was  Did Ben pop in your brain at all?  Yes  So?  First thing  Because I know he's a big YouTube fan  But it wasn't a sure thing  Yeah  A lot of things pop into my head  It was worth the callback  Have I ever called you when I'm jacking off?  Hey Hope  I was just thinking of you  A lot of things pop into your head  A penis  Alright  Well congratulations to Ben  Well because Bono's one of your heroes 
[02:07:30]  He's hung out and talked with Bono  I've met him before  For quite a while  Yeah we had a five minute conversation  How about next time you put  It's Ben comma  Just so I know it's you  Because most people's text message  They get it  I know  I don't know why I'm like  Your phone's retarded  What's wrong with my phone?  Your phone's retarded  Alright Anthony  Oh sugar  Why don't we go to break  It's you two from Saturday Night Live  You want to play this?  Play I Will Follow  Play I Will Follow instead  Well what about sometimes  You can make it on your own  That's a pretty good song  Isn't that the theme song  For Mary Tyler Moore?  You want to just go to  I Will Follow? 
[02:08:00]  Something familiar?  Alright we'll do that  Yeah that's  From SNL this Saturday night  Yeah but that's what  Regular radio would do  What?  Play the hit  Alright we'll play  I Will Follow  Would you  I was on the inside  What you say  You say you're saying  You hit me  You're gonna stop 
[02:08:30]  Rolling at my skin  But I can see  A boy tries hard to be  And you're gonna take  And you're gonna take  Him by his hand  It stops the thing  And you're gonna  Always wonder  What's the way 
[02:09:00]  What's the way  What's the way  What's the way  I'm gonna follow  What's the way  What's the way  What's the way  I was gone  I was on the inside 
[02:09:30]  When you pull up  I was down  Stop scratch  Keepin' going  I said I'm on the floor  I'm lost and I'm found  I'm out of the way  I'm out of the way  I'm out of the way  I'm on the inside  I'll follow you anyway  I'll follow you anyway  I'll follow you anyway 
[02:10:00]  I'll follow you anyway  I'll follow you anyway  I'll follow you anyway  I'll follow you anyway  Your eyes  Make a circle  I see it when I go in here  Your eyes 
[02:10:30]  Your eyes  Your eyes  Your, your, your, your  Your eyes  I love, I love, I love  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  I got blood rushing in my mule right now. That is so hot.  The best thing with TV on the commercial, especially the stupid ones, like the ones for ex-lax. 
[02:12:00]  Now, this is a laxative.  But in the commercial, they have this grown woman talking to her grown daughter.  They refer to ex-lax as their family's best friend.  Now, I wonder where they go for the holidays.  The next time that commercial is on, listen carefully to what the man says during the commercial.  He's talking about the laxative.  He says, and I quote,  It works while you sleep. 
[02:12:30]  I don't want that.  No, I want to be up and awake.  Ready to go.  All right, do you avail yourself today of the modern miracle medicines?  I don't take drugs. I don't like drugs.  Don't use any drugs?  I don't use drugs.  So, well, what do you use instead of drugs, or if you need, if you have some illness or disease? 
[02:13:00]  Fruits, fruits, the elixir of life.  You mean fruits can cure diseases?  Fruits. There's a fruit for any disease that mankind has.  Hard to believe.  Name the disease, I'll give you the fruit.  Really?  Absolutely.  Arterial sclerosis?  Bananas.  Bananas?  Bananas, because arterial sclerosis is hardening in the artery, you need something soft.  Either bananas, or a mushy pear.  Either one, I'll take it.  How about tuberculosis?  Tuberculosis? 
[02:13:30]  Blueberries.  TB?  How? Why?  They stain the tubercle bacteria. You find them, you kill them.  Blueberries.  How about diarrhea?  Diarrhea, you've got to eat peaches.  Peaches?  Peaches are very good for diarrhea.  Any kind of peaches?  Oh, no.  Not Alberta.  No, really?  No.  They're clean peaches.  Why?  I know why.  They hold it together a little bit.

[02:16:00]  Drunk girls walking into traffic is funny.  Wandered into traffic and bounced off the hood of a fucking bus.  I can see my house from here.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  All right.  We have Tom very pissed off on the phone line. 
[02:16:30]  Why?  We'll find out.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, man.  How's it going?  Pretty good.  What's up?  I've been a fan for the nine years since you've been in Boston.  You know, I was an AAF listener.  I followed you guys.  I got the satellite radio just to hear you guys.  Okay.  And I want to express my displeasure with all the U2 that's going on.  Ah.  Well, it's not a lot of U2.  You either like it or hate it, I guess.  But it's not a lot.  We played a few tracks when we got, you know, the album way before anyone else. 
[02:17:00]  And then, well, now we played a couple tracks from their SNL gig.  I just feel like every time Opie's pushing the U2, he's wearing the roller blades and  kind of twiddling his way around the studio there.  No, actually, Ben is pushing.  Ben's pushing more than I.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I think it is also?  I'll point something out.  I think with the satellite radio, where it differs from broadcast radio, I think people  listen a lot more to the show.  Like, they listen to a lot more of it. 
[02:17:30]  The people that are listening are, like, hardcore fans.  And then they listen to the replays.  So there's a lot of it, and it really, like, makes everything that we do really out there.  You know?  So if we play three U2 songs, you know, that's, you're hearing all three.  And if you don't like U2, that's three too many.  It's three too many.  It's three.  That's U2, three too many.  I won't disagree with you, sir. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, well, people that like U2 are really enjoying it.  And the people that don't like U2, they're going to another channel for a little while.  Yeah.  You know, we can't satisfy everyone.  We're trying our best.  You know?  People said that about the Howard crap, too.  Like, we spent too much time talking about Howard.  And I'm thinking, if you really add up with the amount of time we made fun of the guy  that looks like an old lady, it's really not that much.  Well, I'm loving it.  But I guess with the replays and everything, it's just...  It's with the replays, yeah.  You know, every once in a while, do we go off for a half hour or so? 
[02:18:30]  Sure.  Or a couple minutes here and there?  Sure.  But if you really add it up, it's not a lot of air time spent on the guy that looks like  an old lady now.  So, all right.  Thank you, Tom.  Hey, Jimmy.  No, you're not going to get it.  Oh, sir.  He's too good.  I can't be gotten that.  I even know.  No, sir, I'm too good.  I even know.  I even know.  And I'm much slower at that game than good old Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  No, really, Jimmy.  I got something for you.  A hot little item.  Okay. 
[02:19:00]  All right, bye.  It doesn't count if you say, oh, really.  If you break character and you go, no, seriously, I need to talk to you.  No, no, really.  It doesn't count, yeah.  All right, Anthony from Yonkers.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, buddy?  How's your boss?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, all right.  Go ahead.  I got to take Jim to test this morning.  Oh, no.  Yeah, you, Jim.  All right.  And I love you, buddy, but you're wrong.  About what?  Here's why you're messed up.  You're a hypocrite.  Why?  Because here you are saying that you two suck.  They don't even sell out anything.  Not even 10,000 fans, and you want to take a picture of Bono. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, dude, I'll be the first to agree with you.  I'm an ass.  I'll take a picture with Hitler if he showed up.  I took a picture with Usher.  Someone had to show me which one he was.  I knew the name, but I didn't know who he was.  I'm like, which one of those guys is Usher?  They're like the one in the yellow suit.  I'm like, oh.  Yeah, that's really how bad Jim is.  He just likes pictures with famous people.  And I recognize, dude, I recognize.  It doesn't matter who you are.  Bono is a rock star.  I'm not a dummy.  He's a rock star.  So, of course, I get one.  Wait a minute.  But according to you, he's not a rock star because he can't sell out for more than 10 people at his arena.  And you want to go take a picture with him.  Dude, I was probably joking if I said that. 
[02:20:00]  I was probably just busting balls.  Yeah, no, I think he knows how big he too is.  Yeah, dude, I'm not sure.  I know how big.  I'm 50 cent.  I got 50 cent.  I'm not a 50 cent fan.  All right.  And you are a whore big.  I know that.  All right.  50 cents.  It would be hypocritical.  Thanks, Anthony.  It would be hypocritical if I walked up to Bono like I would and said, dude, you're terrific.  I can't believe Sabbath stole Sabbath, bloody Sabbath from you.  Believe me, I would definitely say something stupid to him.  All right.  We have to go backwards a little bit.  But I forgot that we've never talked about this on the show. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, the second mark.  In our time off, though, we've been quoting lines from this thing over and over again to each other.  Ben thinks it's the funniest thing ever.  Oh, of course.  That was ever on TV.  And if you know Psycho Mark, unfortunately for the new listeners, they don't know who Psycho Mark is yet.  Where is Psycho Mark these days?  He's being very responsible as he works for Fox.  Is he still at Fox?  Yes.  What does he do there?  Where's Ben?  Ben would know.  See, now here we've got another guy who doesn't mind the U2.  That's the problem you get when you play music on your radio show. 
[02:21:00]  Look at Ben.  We could play like Hank Williams Jr.  and there'd be a ton of people going, all right, now the boys are talking.  And then the other people will turn us off.  So, you know, we understand that game when we go to music here and there.  Here comes Ben.  He was just by the water machine.  I'll be getting a little drink.  There he is.  Trying to water down his hair.  Keep it calm today.  Ben.  Yes.  We're going to play the Psycho Mark game.  This is hilarious.  What is Psycho Mark doing these days?  He's producing Alan Combs' show with Joe Constantino.  Oh, is that what he does?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  He's producing a radio show. 
[02:21:30]  And he also still works cameraman at Fox.  No?  Fox and Friends are one of those shows.  But this is hilarious because he's naming cities.  You guys weren't even on it.  I remember when this happened.  Opie called me and he's like, what the fuck is he doing?  Yeah.  He's way out of...  He's saying how he knows the leader of the Catholic League, how he's a friend of his.  This was the first guy...  He just lost his mind.  Yeah.  This was the first guy that was even remotely involved with the show that was talking.  This was...  When did this air?  This was the day after.  The day after we got fired.  Or canceled. 
[02:22:00]  Whatever, yeah.  Yeah.  Cancel.  At this point, whatever.  It was a Friday morning because of the thing that happened on a Thursday.  So he was like the inside guy.  Well, because they were trying to get...  It was such a big thing, the Sex and St. Pat's, that they were trying to get anyone on their air.  Yeah.  They wanted us, obviously.  They camped outside our residence for, I don't know, off and on for a couple weeks.  They wanted anybody involved with the show.  Anyone.  Steve, Rick, anybody.  Ben.  Yeah.  Anyone that was even close.  Our agent.  People that worked for Viacom.  No one was talking. 
[02:22:30]  No one was talking except Psycho Mark gave the exclusive interview to Fox and Friends.  And they even goofed on him a little bit at the beginning because he's wearing a suit  and he never wears a suit.  He's like, they're goofing on the fact that he's clean and he's got to give the suit back  to the guy he borrowed it from.  Right.  I guess they pick him up.  He was a regular employee.  He would help us out, but he also worked for Fox and Friends.  So he was like just a regular scumbag over at Fox and Friends.  But he had the exclusive on the biggest story of the day.  So they treated him like a superstar.  They made sure he had a suit. 
[02:23:00]  They got, I think they even got him a limo that day to bring him to work.  Brushed his hair.  Brushed his hair and sat him down for the exclusive interview.  The inside scoop on O.P. and Anthony.  Wonderful.  This thing has made us laugh for the last two years.  I don't know if you'll find it as funny as we do, but we'll stop it.  You've got to also remember, especially the new listeners, this guy is out of his freaking  mind.  Oh, yeah.  That's why he's called Psycho Mark.  But he was using his broadcast voice all of a sudden.  Yeah.  Because this was a very serious day.  You ain't going from talking like this.  Let me tell you how fucked up we were last night. 
[02:23:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah, he'll talk about the collards in Boston with this really bad voice.  Yeah, the collards.  They love keeping them in their own fucking area up there in Boston.  And then he's like, hey, how are you doing, guys?  Right.  So, I use the radio voice now.  Here's the audio.  We'll stop it.  Unfortunately for a couple of guys who are making millions of dollars a year, O.P. and  Anthony in New York City, they were fired yesterday after a couple was caught having sex at St. 
[02:24:00]  Patrick's Cathedral.  And it was all being broadcast on their radio show.  Jenny Sandleton, exclusive details, is a member of that cast, Mark Walsh, better known to  O.P. Anthony on those O.P. Anthony listeners at Psycho Moore.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Good.  Hi, guys.  Good to have me on.  How are you?  Thanks for having me on.  Yeah.  Like he's a general talking about the war.  Thanks for having me on.  It's like Jim Cook.  And right after this interview, he went right behind the camera again and filmed Fox and  Fred.  Yeah.  Thanks for having me on. 
[02:24:30]  Wasn't he miking people back then?  Oh, that's what he was.  That's what his job was.  He would put the little microphones on.  Thanks for having me on.  Before the interview, on those O.P. Anthony listeners at Psycho Moore.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Mark, it's a thrill to see you again, especially Clint.  Thrilled to see you again.  Thrilled to see you again.  They see him every day as he's miking the guest.  He works with you.  He works with you, you idiot.  That'd be like me going, hey, Jimmy, thrilled to see you again.  Right.  Like, oh, he doesn't stop by very often, but good thing he's here today.  All kidding aside, and thanks for having me on. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, no problem.  They're making it sound like he's their expert for things in the media.  Yeah.  He comes on from time to time.  See you again.  Like you said, the war correspondent.  Especially Clint.  Yeah, exactly.  With a suit and everything.  I know.  I didn't know you were.  I feel like a pundit, you know.  Give it back to John Scott at the end of the show.  That's part of the deal.  Fair deal.  But, Mark, let's talk seriously what happened.  Fred was the one, our producer here, to inform you about what happened.  You've talked to O.P. and Anthony since.  He did not.  He did not talk to us.  I'm watching this at home going, Mark did not talk to me. 
[02:25:30]  No.  Mark didn't talk to Anthony.  Uh-uh.  Anthony and I pretty much shut off our cell phones and went into hiding.  Yeah.  My own mom and dad didn't talk to me.  No one talked.  No one talked to us.  And Psycho Mark was not.  We were pretty damn depressed about losing our careers.  No one was talking to us.  Psycho Mark was not spoken to.  I didn't talk for a week, maybe two weeks.  Did you hear the first line?  I've memorized this thing.  It's so funny.  What happened?  You've talked to O.P. and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting...  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say. 
[02:26:00]  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing.  Psycho Mark.  Wow, adding some real new information there.  It was a bad thing.  This is a guy that held up the C word on live TV for us, but all of a sudden, he's going  to throw us out to dry there.  Well, it was a bad thing.  Whenever you use the term needless to say twice in a row, you have nothing to say.  Needless to say, I have nothing to say, nothing to say.  Let it be known, we've never said this. 
[02:26:30]  He was the guy that held up the C-U-N-T sign on live TV.  Yeah, that was him, wasn't it?  Yes, it was.  Yeah, he's also the guy that jumped on the front of the voyeur bus and hung on to the  windshield wipers as it drove down the street, pounding, let me in, let me in.  And bragging that he hit an ounce of pot somewhere on the bus, so they had to take the bus apart.  Like ants take apart a grasshopper.  That's what they did to the voyeur bus, because Psycho Mark was bragging that he hit an ounce  on it.  Guys, they're arresting us right now.  Yeah, they're arresting us, but I hit my pot in one of the seats. 
[02:27:00]  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  They'll never fucking find it.  Oh, I gotta put on my smooth guy, boy.  The cops are coming.  This is the same guy.  I mean, we love the guy, trust me.  Oh, don't get us wrong.  We love the guy.  This guy's a pisser.  He does great radio for us, but this thing is unbelievable.  I'm here to inform you about what happened.  You've talked to Obi and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting...  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing. 
[02:27:30]  What happened was entirely wrong.  And the boys are very upset that it even happened.  The boys?  The boys are very upset.  The boys.  Oh, my God.  The boys.  It's like a father talking about his kids.  The boys are very upset with what happened.  I won't do it again.  Needless to say, I mean, it was needless to say a bad thing.  The entire stunt was entirely wrong.  It's like, geez, he's got four words he's saying.  He's beyond nervous, though.  This is his big moment in the spotlight.  What I'm saying is needless.  Yeah, the boys are really... 
[02:28:00]  They knew they had to get the papers.  Get the papers.  Needless to say, needless to say.  What I'm saying is needless to say.  Yeah.  Ben, we're off the part.  The boys are very upset.  I know.  I was listening to that.  It's hilarious.  Oh, the boys.  It happened.  What was at stake here?  It was a trip to the Sam Adams plant up in Massachusetts.  And whoever got the most points would get the free trip, right?  Exactly.  And the way you get points is?  You go around town and the couples would engage in ludax in different places.  All right, listen to me. 
[02:28:30]  And I just remembered something.  Didn't he go with you that day?  What's that?  Yeah.  He followed you that day with your couple.  Yeah.  So he was actually in there.  So far, he's got the facts straight, though.  Except the fact that he talked to you.  The boys were upset.  Right.  And the reason, by the way, needless to say, needless to say, that he's working at Fox  anyway is because he got fired from his job at WNEW.  And why did he get fired?  For the second annual Sex for Sam contest. 
[02:29:00]  When he took his couple into our boss's office and made them have anal sex on the couch of  our general manager while our program director was looking through the glass door going,  No!  Don't do that!  And Psycho Mark spun his head around, looked at our program director, and said to his couple,  Guys, go for it!  Yeah, live on the air.  What was the program director doing besides instructing the girl how to relax before she  took a cock in her ass? 
[02:29:30]  You just won't let that go, that you didn't get your raise before you got fired.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Anyway, so this is who they have on Fox and Friends.  And he is our pal, but I think it's just hilarious.  You know, in different places.  So they'd have sex in different places.  Exactly.  For points.  And then someone picked the St. Patrick's Cathedral, and even with a 40-second delay,  Well, what happened before the show was, and it was explained to everybody that took  part in the show, do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[02:30:00]  That is a flat-out lie.  That's a lie, too.  We didn't even bring up the word St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Church was on the list.  Yeah.  We kind of told the people, you know, did we even tell them to steer clear of the churches?  I don't think we did.  No, not really.  I think it was on the list, but we assumed...  We were going to control it from where we sat.  Yeah.  We did a great job, didn't we?  We weren't going to take any calls from, like, a church, but... 
[02:30:30]  Or if we did, we were going to, like, play it in a way that we would have probably saved  our asses.  Yeah.  But when we plunked the phone line down and Paul Mercurio just said, we're here at St.  Pat's and they're doing the balloon knot, it was kind of too late.  No turning back.  Could have punched the dump button, though.  All right, here's...  Could have shit, would have.  Here's more Psycho Mark.  Two of my favorite things are still coming up.  Buddy, that took part in the show.  Do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  This was told to all the participants before we even went on air that day, okay?  Can I just jump in real quick?  I mean, any church, there was, like, 25 points that you could get for going into a church. 
[02:31:00]  Wouldn't you just think any church would blow people's minds?  Well, most of the stuff that happens is, it's radio.  It's on air.  It's a description.  It's theater of the mind, so to speak.  So to speak.  He is an expert on radio.  Radio, it's theater of the mind, so to speak.  So you have a theater and a mind, neither of which I'm in possession of at this moment.  What makes this funny, if you know Psycho Mark, like, we know... 
[02:31:30]  What a tool.  I love it.  I love it.  How did you guys get Rod Serling to do an interview on your behalf?  Pitiful portrait...  Exactly.  ...of a dumped duo.  Exactly.  Submitted for your approval, Opie and Anthony.  So to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as on the air.  Now, wait a minute.  What?  Those acts aren't necessarily happening, but they are as described on the air. 
[02:32:00]  Described as on the air.  Described as on the air.  Yeah.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Bling, bling, bling.  Doing gymnastics with the English language.  Exactly.  What is he trying to say here?  So to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as on the air.  Now, wait a minute.  Are you saying they didn't really have sex?  Because the usher says the people were partially naked.  I'm not going to get into the...  If they wanted to do a theater to the line, they would have been in a car outside and said, 
[02:32:30]  We're inside the church.  Okay.  Well, what happened was there's a fail-safe system on the show.  There's a 40-second delay that they use.  In other words, they have up to 10 times to dump out of the show within 40 seconds.  So if something gets aired that's inappropriate, there's an opportunity to take it off the show.  So why didn't they dump it?  Well, that's what happened.  There's a whole chain of command, the system that works with the program director and the general manager.  Both suspended.  Well, they both have boxes in their office and are able to dump out of the show at any time. 
[02:33:00]  Now, they should have been on The Post that afternoon monitoring the show.  Now, these guys, it's Opie and Anthony.  You know, you're not talking about...  You don't go to them for news, weather, and sports.  This is not Paul Harvey.  Exactly.  You don't tune into Fox for, you know, dirty jokes.  Ah, he almost said dick jokes.  They're shock jocks.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  You've got to stay on top of them.  You've got to stay on top of them.  Mark, we spent half our time staying on top of you, you idiot.  Oh, God.  How he is portraying himself in this is really funny. 
[02:33:30]  He's coming off like he's the responsible guy.  The voice of reason.  Yeah.  A gentleman.  The voice of reason.  Now, I'm sitting here in my suit, criticizing.  Man.  Exactly.  You don't tune into Fox for, you know, dirty jokes.  They're shock jocks.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  So yesterday they got fired.  The general manager and the program director have been suspended.  Are they going to get canned, too?  Most likely.  And what happened is the formats will probably change at the station.  You'll probably see a switch probably to light music. 
[02:34:00]  You're kidding me.  So they're going to lose all that talk and that dramatic switch that no carmazon made happen.  Well, they're on several markets as well.  They're number one in Philly.  They're number one in Buffalo.  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they?  Detroit.  Detroit.  That's the only thing he's got wrong so far, really.  His facts are right.  They did go to it.  What a good call.  Yeah, well, he kind of knew that.  They were going to light FM.  I mean, after the thing that blinked didn't work, they went right to light FM.  He's right.  We're on in Detroit. 
[02:34:30]  They're number one in Buffalo.  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they?  Detroit.  Let me think of another city.  Detroit.  Did they move to another station to do their show from there?  Because they were fired from Boston.  Exactly.  They were also fired from...  Doing something.  But you know what?  I spoke to them last night.  Is that correct, Mark?  Yes, for the mayor's death.  Yeah, they made believe the mayor died.  But this is Opie and Anthony.  I mean, these guys, they said the mayor was dead on April Fool's Day.  I mean, come on.  Who's going to really believe it?  Ultimately, this just...  How many people know it's April 1st?  Come on!  Ultimately, though, this shows you how far afield shock jocks have gotten. 
[02:35:00]  I mean, it used to be just Howard Stern just talking quasi-dirty, but now we're having sex...  Quasi-dirty?  ...in a church.  The Catholic League, with 350 members, now says, you know what?  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for WNEW to lose their license.  It says, when does the Catholic League have 350 members?  Yeah.  Do you think he's off?  A little bit.  I didn't hear that, actually.  Yeah.  The Catholic League, with its 350 members... 
[02:35:30]  Now it says, you know what?  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for WNEW to lose their license.  So they're stepping away from it.  Which is a fair shot.  And they had every right to be mad.  I mean, Bill Donahue is a good guy.  And then he had every right to be a star.  He's not a good guy!  What an ass.  He's never talked to Bill Donahue.  Yeah, he did.  He had him on the Fox show once, and he put a microphone on him.  That's what Mark did.  He told me.  He goes, I had Bill Donahue sitting in the chair, and I clipped the little clip-on microphone 
[02:36:00]  on him, and turned on the little battery pack, and that was it.  But he's not a good guy.  He's an arrogant demagogue and a douche.  He wants to push his morality on everybody.  Well, you know, I sat down and spoke with him.  He's a good guy.  Could you say check one, two?  Thank you.  That's the extent of our conversation.  Highest asshole he is.  Bill Donahue is a good guy, and he had every right to be upset. 
[02:36:30]  Real quickly, did they ever talk to Opie and Anthony?  Did they ever sit there and say, well, maybe this is going over the line?  Or was it just like, hey, let's push the envelope?  It all goes over the line.  It happens so fast.  In other words, it made the air, and it's like, you know, you stepped in crap.  Oh, God.  You know, what do you do?  You're in it.  And it was too late.  Can we leave that out?  It was hard.  Mark, my last question, are they going to sue to get their jobs back?  Because this is what they do.  They might have a lawyer.  Chances are they'll probably, they're in negotiations right now with another company.  And we'll probably see them back on the air shortly. 
[02:37:00]  So they'll take millions of dollars from CBS for leaving and go get another job someplace else.  Most likely that's exactly what's going to happen.  All right, Mark Walsh, thanks very much for giving us the exclusive details on the morning show, Robin.  All right, thanks very much.  He's got a different house impression.  He's such an ass.  That was the best part.  He goes, I know for a fact they're negotiating with another company.  I'm sitting home going, really?  Really?  We're negotiating, huh?  Why don't you tell us who that is?  It only took two years and three months to get back on the radio, Mark.  Yeah, that's all.  But we're negotiating a day after being canceled. 
[02:37:30]  That's most likely what'll happen in the Twilight Zone.  Really?  Bob Eatman is currently on the right wing of an aircraft.  My brother's on the wing.  You've got to open the door.  We just find that very funny because we know the guy.  He's definitely trying to help us out, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  No, Mark is trying to help himself out.  Mark loves attention.  And when they said, hey, why don't you come on and talk about ONA? 
[02:38:00]  You'd think he was going to say, well, I really don't have that much information.  Or, get me the suit and turn on the camera.  Get me the suit, get me the ride, and I'm in.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  Needless to say, you know, needless to say.  The entire thing was entirely exactly.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Exactly.  My entire interview was needless to say.  Entirely.  Exactly. 
[02:38:30]  Let me say exactly entirely.  Bill Donahue's a good guy.  You know, Hitler was really criticized.  No one really looks at all the good he did.  Mussolini was a great oil painter.  That's our old pal.  We'll get him back on the air eventually.  You know, he kept the trains on time.  Exactly.  You'd look at your watch and say, the train is supposed to come in at 9. 
[02:39:00]  Is it on time?  Exactly.  Exactly on time.  Oh, really?  Do I need a schedule?  Or, needless to say, needless to have schedule.  There's a platform full of frightened people, but needless to say, they'll all be hustled into the cars.  And moved along.  He's too much.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's going to be hot on those cars.  Exactly.  Needless to say, they should be hosed down.  Maybe give some chocolates to the people at the next station to hose them down. 
[02:39:30]  They were indeed kept together when they had arrived at the family camps.  And before they got on, there was a discussion, don't go to Auschwitz.  Don't go to Auschwitz.  Needless to say.  Oh, food's here.  Let's take a break.  Oh, we got some smoothies coming.  Smoothies today?  What flavor did you get?  Did they have a banana orange?  Yes, they did.  They did.  Look at you.  I'm having a smoothie. 
[02:40:00]  Yum, yum.  Give me some.  I got the same one, Jimmy got.  I know.  All right.  Anthony, as we go to break, we're...  Thanks, sweetie.  Get whole smoothie, even though only half show.  Did half show get whole smoothie?  Hmm?  Brian Regan.  Anthony, we got the Casey Kasem thing.  Thank you.  Listener is sending back all the stuff we used to play on the show.  Oh, Casey Kasem.  Because speaking of the old gig, we weren't allowed to take anything from the office,  so the listeners are emailing stuff in every day now.  And now a long-distance sandwich. 
[02:40:30]  This is one of our favorites.  You've heard it a million times, but...  Exactly, and needless to say, this one comes in at number 10.  No, it's funny.  Every DJ in America has played this bit, but there are people out there claiming that  they're getting ripped off because other people play it.  Who, who, who, Robin?  It's not even, it's not even your material to, to claim that people are ripping it off.  This one, climbing the charts.  All right, so it's Casey Kasem's, uh, outtakes, everyone.  Exactly.  The Countdown will begin this Sunday afternoon at 1, right here on the radio station you grew up with. 
[02:41:00]  Music Radio 138.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here?  Geez, well, isn't it the last hour?  We got another hour to do?  Geez, I thought we were almost finished.  Good golly, Miss Molly.  Boy, this is fucking ponderous, man.  Ponderous, fucking ponderous.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40 has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning and every Saturday morning at 2, 2. 
[02:41:30]  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand,  whether we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio, and here's what he writes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request,  but I'm quite sincere and it'll mean a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles, 
[02:42:00]  but he was most certainly a part of...  Let's start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please.  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man,  it's impossible to make those transitions,  and then you've got to go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for,  but goddamn it, if we can't come out of a slow record,  I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort 
[02:42:30]  to come out of a record  that isn't a fucking up-tempo record  every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know  what happened to the pictures  I was supposed to see this week.  Since the last goddamn time,  I want somebody who's his fucking brain  to not come out of a goddamn record  that's up-tempo,  and I've got to talk about a fucking dog dying.  How much ass does that kick? 
[02:43:00]  How much ass does that kick?  Sexy  East side  Poody  Let's do it  Poody  Poody  These boobs rock!  Judge  Is anyone menstruated?  My nipples are hard just thinking about her.  Has everybody gone crazy?  Snab, you judge letter.  DOB and Anthony Show. 
[02:43:30]  I had my gallbladder out.  Anyone have that?  Yeah?  Did it hurt?  It really hurt.  The gallbladder hurt.  Getting it out felt better, right?  Did they take a stool sample?  I'm just checking if everything was on the up and up. 
[02:44:00]  Because this doctor, I hope he was a doctor, took a stool sample.  Now, I always thought there'd be a medical tool involved in this procedure.  But the guy just reached up my ass and grabbed some duke out.  He's like, you're going to feel some slight discomfort.  I'm like, just fucking do it, will you?  Actually, I didn't say that.  You know what? 
[02:44:30]  You don't get too lippy when you're waiting for a guy to stick his hand up your ass.  I'm like, tell me more about your day.  And I try not to live my life with regrets.  But when he had his finger in my ass, I regret that and go, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Daddy like, yeah.  Just to watch him freak out.  He'll be like, I go, I mean, ouch.  USA Today did a survey. 
[02:45:00]  Anybody got a guess?  The number one thing married people fight about?  Money.  Money.  By far.  Good old money.  Because my wife and I, we don't fight much.  Whenever we fight, it's always about money.  My wife, you know, gets pissed off because we don't have any money.  And I get pissed off because we did.  Money's a dumb thing to fight about.  I mean, hell, most of us have been broke.  How many people have been broke at some point in your life? 
[02:45:30]  Doesn't that feel good?  I mean, I'm talking about Kraft macaroni and cheese, bro.  Suave shampoo, bro.  Remember suave shampoo?  A hundred gallons for a dollar.  I was so broke when I was in college, they sent a guy to repossess my car.  You know, just because I didn't make a payment for about four years or something.  The guy, big man, showed up in my house.  He said, Mr. Foxworthy, he said, I am from the bank.  And unless you have $300, I'm taking that Camaro with me. 
[02:46:00]  I got mad.  I said, 300 bucks?  Who keeps that kind of cash on them?  He said, well, you can't write me a check.  I said, no, I can't.  A check?  Yeah, I can write you a check.  I thought you needed money.  Then what, I'm going to go ahead and pay the whole thing off right now.  It's the O&A virus. 
[02:46:30]  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything all the time.  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Damn good smoothie. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, fantastic.  Damn good smoothie.  Banana orange.  What did you get, Opie?  What?  Did you get a smoothie?  Just a banana.  When I send them back for another one, I'll be glad to treat you to a smoothie.  They're really good.  All right.  The O&A virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:47:30]  Can I ask a question?  Yes.  This has been bugging me for two weeks.  Every time I go into the bathroom, the goddamn window is open.  Who is opening the window?  Is it New York?  You know, it is freezing.  It's 35 degrees out.  How bad are somebody's log fumes?  Leave the fucking window closed.  You know, you're right.  That bathroom is freezing cold because the window's open.  Some germaphobe is like, oh, I've got to open the window to get the dirty germs out.  Why?  You want to bath them all hot.  Yeah, and steamy.  You know, you want to smell it, the fella next to your head for lunch. 
[02:48:00]  Nothing better than leaning your head out of the store going, hey, pastrami?  And he laughs, and he gives you the old knuckle to the chin.  But I went in there, and I closed it earlier this morning.  So somebody went in and opened it.  I would like somebody to fess up.  Reopened it.  Ben?  No?  He doesn't know?  I thought he was coming in with an answer.  Nice.  You know, who's opening that bathroom window?  It might be Ben, because that gust of wind maybe hits him when he opens the window.  No, he actually opened it because it smells like shit in there.  No, it doesn't. 
[02:48:30]  You're the one that opens it every morning?  I'm not the only one that does it.  Oh, so Ben is a...  Exactly.  Who else does it?  It's 30 degrees out.  I'm trying to shit.  It's not 30 degrees out.  My bag is gripping me like a little hornet's nest.  Good.  First of all, you...  You destroy that place.  Somebody go in there.  You really teach that bathroom a lesson.  Well, you're not supposed to go in there and eat egg salad.  You walk in, you take your dump of your leak, and you leave.  It's not supposed to smell good in there.  It's a men's room.  I miss Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, we do miss him.  That guy that used to clean the bathroom in any W.  That guy would put a...  He would have welded that window shut so no one could open it.  You know what used to suck about that guy?  He would always be there when you had to take the dump.  We used to get these limited times where we could actually squeeze out a dump.  Limited times?  You were playing 18 minutes of commercials an hour.  Yeah, but there was always something going on where it was hard to run all the way down  the hall to get to that bathroom and take the dump.  And you didn't know if Norton was banging some chick over the toilet, which he'd been known 
[02:49:30]  to do exactly.  How many times did you bang chicks in that bathroom?  Not many.  One or twice.  The answer should be like never, because it's a work environment, but Norton's answer is  not many.  Now, one time I whacked my bag with some chick in the stinky stairwell.  A couple times I hooked up in there.  I got blown in there once.  That was a great, great...  N.E.W. is fantastic.  Yeah.  Lots of nooks and crannies.  Oh, places to leave loads all over.  Now, the thing is...  But in here, there's nowhere.  It's all well lit.  The bathroom there that we used to use for dumps wasn't just an N.E.W. bathroom. 
[02:50:00]  It was for that floor.  So other people from other offices would go into that bathroom.  We kind of had like a private bathroom, hoo, hoo, hoo, outside the studio, but we made  it the...  We made it no crunch zone.  The crunch-free zone.  Because it stunk the entire green room up.  Green room up.  Right.  You could take a dump in there, and then the door would open up, and it would stick the  entire floor up.  So we said no crunching.  That's for urination only.  And then the other bathroom, you'd run down there, and there was Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS  cleaning up with his big yellow gloves on. 
[02:50:30]  The door propped open with his cart, and you're like, it just wrecked.  I can't now take a dump.  I'm going to be making some noise.  Oh, man.  And when one of those logs got stuck, he would just put that yellow glove on and go to town  to make sure it went down that bowl.  He'd choke it.  He would choke it and break it apart so it went down with his bare hand.  If you had trouble taking a dump, he'd actually pick you up and bear hug you from the front  and help squeeze it out like your toothpaste, that faggot.  I remember one time I was on a bowl, and I'm dropping what was awful, some type of miscarriage 
[02:51:00]  in the toilet.  And I see his foot come under my stall and pull a piece of paper out that was sticking  half-up.  That guy has the worst job, and he loved his job.  He really did.  He took his job very seriously.  I don't know what his name was, but I hope he died in the two years that we were off.  Tragically.  We kind of like that guy.  I hope he was at his kid's wedding and he had a stroke while cleaning a bathroom.  We like that guy.  We didn't like him.  I didn't like him.  He didn't like anything to you.  I didn't like him.  He ruined about 40 dumps.  He should die in a tuxedo, scooping a toilet out. 
[02:51:30]  Dude, the guy was making $15,000 a year to squish logs so they could go down a bowl.  I bet you he wasn't making anything.  He probably showed up voluntarily to do it.  And you wished death on the guy?  Yeah.  He did ruin a lot of dumps.  All I ask is I'm alone in the bathroom.  Do you know when you're walking?  No, you don't ask for being alone in the bathroom.  As soon as one of us wants to go to the bathroom, you follow right behind us.  To take a whiz is fine, but I've got to take a dump.  Right.  I want nothing.  There were times where I'd be walking down the hallway when you got the pain where the  back of your thighs hurt, and there's only one thing going to fix it, getting in there 
[02:52:00]  and releasing.  Yep.  And your body knows that you're approaching the bathroom and starts winding up, and you're  around that corner, and there's Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS, with his cart, and his gloves,  and you're just, God, I'm already in the mode.  I've started the, the whole, the wheels are in motion.  That gas paint where you're unbuttoning your belt, undoing your belt, and you're afraid  that if you sit, you're going to shit on the way down. 
[02:52:30]  You ever have to, I've actually have to stand over the toilet, like, and not bend until that  one gas paint.  Right.  Because if I try to bend, I'm going to shit down the back of my leg.  It's all over.  Those are the best.  And you hold it until you get the chapter you want, and then you just start reading  release.  Why is it you have to get to a painting to start reading?  I'm summing right through this particular chess problem.  Goddamn ads.  I like to read chess books on the toilet.  I'll actually hold it until I get to the right Kasparov game.  I'm a weirdo, yeah.  I have a pile of popular mechanics. 
[02:53:00]  I read popular mechanics.  Hey, what's new?  I'm not in.  Let's see what's coming out.  Hey, look at what was out a hundred years ago today.  Hey, I'm not in long enough to read anything.  I'm not in there long enough to read anything.  You're not.  I'm trying to figure out a way to get a magnetic chess board so I can bring it in the bathroom  so I can work out chess moves on the toilet.  Chess moves.  I swear to God, that's all I want to do.  Play chess on the toilet.  How are you not in there long enough to read?  Yeah, what are you, just pull them and leave?  Yeah, just real quick. 
[02:53:30]  There are times that you'll just be relaxing.  You're done with your business, but I'm not done reading.  And then you get the big butthickey ring, and you wind up walking out, you look like  a newborn fawn.  I'm going to walk out on your asleep legs.  I'm back to being regular.  Yeah, but you could be regular and still hang out for a quick read.  Get up in four, three quick dumps within 15 minutes, done for the day.  Really?  Yep, done for the day.  Jesus, back to normal.  Cancer patient bowels, three dumps as soon as you get up?  Three dumps, one after another. 
[02:54:00]  Get out of that head!  It's the weirdest thing.  I want that head so clean that Opie himself will be proud to dig a dump in it, three times  before he goes to work.  I once had one stuck.  So you eat all this oatmeal and crap.  Right.  I was on the train, and I was in there for a long time, and it was still attached, and  I know it was like, and you know the bowls and the trains and stuff, that there's a lot  of room before it hits water?  Yeah.  So it's just kind of hanging there.  Oh, God!  A bungee log.  But the best part, I knew there was a lot more in me, attached to this particular log, 
[02:54:30]  and I'm sitting there, and I'm waiting, and I'm waiting, and I'm like, what the F I'm  going to do?  So I start doing the dump exercises, like I stand up, and I start, like, jumping, just  trying to release the thing from my body.  I swear to God, I really thought I would have to go in there with whatever, it probably  would have had to be my fingers or something.  I don't know.  It turns sideways, halfway out sometimes, and it just jams, and it's awful.  It turns sideways.  When you go to wipe it, if you have to, like, finish it, you feel like, this is not going  to happen, you go through 50 pieces of paper, and it's still a problem. 
[02:55:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I have to stay in there until it's all out.  Do you?  Yeah.  That's why you've got to hang out for a while.  But I was, like, pushing my stomach, I was jumping up and down a little bit, and this  damn thing was still attached.  I can't stand how gross these conversations get, but I guess everyone goes through it.  Now, when you're not done, and you know, like, the final chapter hasn't happened, the final  drop hasn't been done.  It's hanging, and I know I got at least another four to five inches. 
[02:55:30]  What about the surprise, though?  You think it came off, you're sitting there reading, and after a while it's like, what?  You feel that, and then, whoop!  I didn't even know that was there!  Or you stand up, and it's gotten a little cooler because your body temperature isn't with  it, and you feel it brush against the back of your cheek, and you're like, ah!  Come on!  You know what I'm talking about?  There's a little piece that's still stuck.  Do you wipe?  No, no, when you stand up, I stand up to wipe.  I don't sit and wipe.  I'm not a girl.  I stand up, I put one foot on the bowl, and one foot... 
[02:56:00]  Wait, no, no, no, no, no.  Always!  I never sit.  Don't look at me like I'm weird when everyone's laughing at you for your wiping habit.  Dude, I stand up.  Why do we have to have the demonstration?  I just see the way I'm talking.  That's really how you wipe?  You stand up.  I put one foot on the bowl seat, and the other foot's on the floor, and I actually  lean forward and arch my ass out.  It is very bizarre.  And I wipe this way I can get in there.  I want it clean.  Oh, man!  You guys sit on a toilet and wipe? 
[02:56:30]  Oh, my God.  You don't sit.  It's a bend over thing, so you're almost...  Your head is, like, between your knees, but you're still sitting.  Never!  And then you reach back and you take care of business.  No.  There's no standing.  Dude, it was embarrassing.  That defeats the purpose.  You're messing stuff up by standing up.  When I was in Iraq, one of the problems we had, we had to use these bathrooms, the soldiers  used, and they're, like, these little portable tents that have these, like, you know, tent  stalls next to each other.  Yeah.  And when you sit, your feet go straight out, and there's a leather curtain. 
[02:57:00]  So I would...  I think they just don't want you on the toilet all day, so they make it slightly uncomfortable.  So I would do that to wipe my ass, but my head would poke out of the curtain, so  people walking into the bathroom would just see me half-leaning out of the curtain.  It was the only way I could wipe my crack.  Oh, these are so sick.  Yes, Ben?  I got a great one.  My old apartment, when I first moved to New York, I had this little apartment.  I was dating this girl, and I'd come home, and I'd taken a dump, and it didn't...  It got all clogged up, and I didn't have a plunger. 
[02:57:30]  So imagine what it was like.  I had to go down to the doorman downstairs and come back up.  That was one of the...  That was a pretty bad one.  That's brutal.  Nothing worse than the overflowing toilet at someone else's house.  You ever have a log overflow over the top of the pole?  When I see...  I learned this at a very young age.  When I see the water coming up in the toilet, you get that panic.  You panic, but right away, I lunge under the toilet, and it's a race against time. 
[02:58:00]  Will the water reach the top and overflow, or will I shut that valve off quick enough?  Where under the toilet is that?  Under every toilet, on the side or under the toilet, is the little tin valve that you must  turn quickly.  Oh, I didn't know that.  And it shuts off, and right when the water reaches the top, oh.  But then you've got to get rid of it.  Plunger.  What if there's no plunger?  Fishnet.  I have learned to use anything.  A little guppy fishnet.  Anything in the garbage pail.  Sometimes, I've used shampoo bottles at people's houses, where if the water goes down low enough, 
[02:58:30]  you wait long enough, it'll slowly go down, but it won't be unplugged.  You take a shampoo bottle, shove it in there, and then pull it out real quick, it'll do  it.  Rolled up newspaper.  If people read a lot, or a magazine, you'll roll it up, roll it up, shove it down the hole,  and then give it a few pumps.  And then you'll hear that, ah, the crap's down.  I'm off the hook.  Because you don't want to, you know. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, you don't want logs in your little bath mat, little pieces of fetid dump.  You'll never get that stuff out.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, you know, Bill brings up a good point here.  Bill from Colorado, go ahead.  Hey, man, I was listening to Jimmy talk about the position he's in when your wife's his ass.  When I was a kid once, I think I walked in on my sister, I think that's the same position  girls get in when they put a tampon in, isn't it?  You know, that's what's on the box.  You're probably right.  That's the instruction on the box.  It shows a girl how to stand, that it's one foot on the toilet, one foot on the floor, 
[02:59:30]  and then the insertion.  For me, it's just to get my crack nice and clean.  That's why I do it.  I don't have a very hairy crack, but I like it clean.  I'm a weirdo, but I like hygiene.  Oh, you could like it clean, but you don't have to use that position.  Dude, I dig my finger away in.  I get every piece of paper.  I do.  It's not gross.  I'm clean.  Rick, what's going on?  You guys could eat my ass right now.  It's fantastic.  You can actually penetrate.  Oh, yeah, always.  Do you use the little wipes that they have out now?  I actually bought them recently, and what I'll do...  Aren't they a treat?  Not every time, but I usually shower after.  If I'm going out, I'll shower.  But I'll take a toilet paper, I'll wipe it, and I'll use the wipes and get it, like put 
[03:00:00]  the finger, wrap the finger in the wipe and then push it up, pull it out.  I want the whole channel clean, dude.  I don't just want the outside.  You guys want the outside.  That's why you get skid marks.  I never get skid marks.  Ever.  I don't get skid marks.  Ah, you guys have told...  Years ago.  I'm just saying.  Well, that's because I had the flu.  Years ago.  It looked like a used shoe shine rag because I had the flu.  I have the flu sometimes.  As long as you have a nice, airtight seal, there's no need to clear beyond the doorway.  No.  To clean it up, you know? 
[03:00:30]  Sorry, guys.  You don't have to penetrate the seal.  Always.  If a chick's giving you a Hummer and she licks your bag, it's going to reek.  You ever go down on a girl and smell that?  I've had that happen where you're going down on her.  She parts her legs and that smell of old capicol comes up and you're like...  Let's go to Kurt in Jersey.  What's up, Kurt?  Okay, okay.  I give up.  Go back to gay. 
[03:01:00]  We're doing pretty well getting the gay out so far.  That's funny.  We had that hot chick from Oregon this morning.  She was all right.  Actually, Rick is calling from Oregon as well.  Rick, what's up?  All right.  Enough of this.  It's like I'm driving a big truck down the road.  There's nowhere to pull off the road and now I've got to take a dump.  Now you've got to go.  All right.  That little gurgling.  Is there anything worse than that gurgling when you can't do anything about it?  We call it the percolating.  You're percolating.  I had one before I got on a flight to Atlanta a few months ago. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know what was wrong.  I wasn't sick.  But I must have taken eight shits in the airport.  That's the worst place to take a dump.  Everything in laptops.  Ian.  Ian.  Ian.  All right.  We'll get ready, Ian.  Oh, Mike's checking in from Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey.  You were the guy that sent in the Monster Rain song earlier.  Yeah.  I sent in the cruise.  I didn't realize the specific rules that you guys had and guidelines.  No.  We're kidding about the rules and guidelines.  I mean, you can send in whatever you want. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  You can send in original.  That was kind of 80s, dude.  Well, dude.  I'm right from the 80s.  I agree.  I guess I didn't realize my style was that intense 80s writing.  That is complete 80s.  There is nothing more 80s sounding than your song.  Yeah.  I wanted to go under a porch and take a guy's dick out and not suck it, but just tie like  bandanas around it.  And talk to it.  What can I do?  Tease the pubes all up.  Hairspray it.  Keep trying, you know.  I can write.  I can do all kinds of stuff. 
[03:02:30]  But now that I've got a better idea, I'm going to give it one more shot.  Take a song.  You could even do it to an 80s song.  You know?  Right.  Like, take a song that's already out there.  That would be cool.  But to do it like an original 80s song, it's kind of, you know.  I like to hear one to Every Rose Has Its Thorn There.  You think?  I could do that.  What song is that?  Poison.  Poison.  I could do that.  No problem.  Every Monster Has Its Rain.  That's right.  Every Monster Has Its Rain.  Bon Jovi, Dead or Alive, Under a Steel, Porch I Rise.  Oh, hey, hey.  Now we're on to something. 
[03:03:00]  I just thought doing my own little thing was kind of cool, you know.  But I'll work on it.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  How about I give Rain a bad name?  There's a lot of stuff you can do.  No?  All right.  I'm looking forward to redeeming myself here and get something back out of it.  All right.  Get back to work.  Thanks, Mike.  Bye, sweetie.  Later.  Speaking of Monster Rain, we got the kid from Florida outside.  He wants to play his Monster Rain song for us.  Oh.  And people are requesting the rap version.  Jimmy says.  Get to caca.  Why don't we play this again as we get to it?  We're not taking a break.  As we get the guy from Florida in here with his Monster Rain song. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  He's a real kook.  People are asking for this one again, so why not?  It's a hip-hop one.  Check this out.  Yeah, the Monster Rain song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get your cock out. 
[03:04:00]  Jimmy says, get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth.  Put your face south while we're under the house.  Jimmy.  Crawl under the porch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said it.  Crawl under the porch.  The Monster Rain's coming.  The sky's gray.  My pants down.  Two kids helping each other under the damn house.  Y'all know the game.  Monster fucking rain.  It ain't a damn thing.  Change.  Y'all under the porch.  Your friend fellate you.  Crawl under.  As two digits masturbate you. 
[03:04:30]  I alleviate the stress with a cock caress.  I explode on my friend's neck with a monster mess.  Just two little toys.  No need for vaginal lube.  Suck on a little crotch with a slight lack of pubes.  We gotta keep it quiet.  Make sure mom don't find out.  I'll finish you off quick so I can pull mine out.  It's just a little pleasure with a lot of shame.  Who cares?  I gotta blame it all on the Monster Rain.  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth.  Put your face south while we're under the house. 
[03:05:00]  Jimmy, crawl under the porch.  Yeah, I said it.  Crawl under the porch.  The Monster Rain's coming.  The sky's gray.  My pants down.  Two kids helping each other under the damn house.  Jimmy Norton.  Get your cock out.  Jimmy Robinson.  Get your cock out.  Willie D'Angelo.  Get your cock out.  Everybody.  Get your cock out.  And there it is from Chemistry.  Nice. 
[03:05:30]  From Wackbag.com.  Jimmy says, I think that's our favorite right now, right?  Yeah, that one's pretty good.  Well, I still like some of the older ones we've played.  Yeah.  They're all wonderful in their own way.  All right.  Brian says this is the best Monster Rain song yet.  Hands down, the current winner.  What about Monster?  What about the one done to Monster Man?  I don't know.  People really seem to like this.  Monster Rain.  All right.  Aaron's in the studio from Florida.  Hi, fella.  Yeah, Florida.  Jacksonville.  And you didn't come up just to give us this.  No, it's actually, I used to live around here. 
[03:06:00]  It's my birthday, and I figured I'd bring it with me and come up with you guys.  Oh, happy birthday.  Welcome back to the radio.  I brought you guys some things here.  I don't know if I'm allowed to say the name, but.  Stacker 2?  Yeah, you guys are always bitching about being tired, so I figured I'd bring this in.  There you go.  Do you work for Stacker 2?  Absolutely not.  You're some maniac with pills in her neck.  Childhood homosexuality story.  In the song, I mean.  All right.  We get gifts all the time.  Stacker 2?  All right.  Thank you.  I just thought I'd clarify something before we started.  It's not that I'm overconfident that I came in here.  I just thought it was worth the ribbing if you guys are going to beat on me that I come 
[03:06:30]  in and see.  All right.  Why don't you tell us about your song?  It's to the Eminem song, Just Don't Give a Fuck.  And I don't know.  I thought originally I was going to do it to Blind Melon, and it was pretty gay and corny.  Which Blind Melon song?  No Rain.  No Rain.  Monster Rain.  I wonder if that would work.  That's pretty good.  It didn't work for me.  No?  No.  I can't sing anyway, so I figured this would be a little easier.  This is to the, which one is called Just Don't Give a Fuck?  Which one is this?  This is off his, I think, second or third album.  Not the latest album.  First album?  Is it the first?  I don't know if I know this one.  I thought it was the second album. 
[03:07:00]  Hold on.  We've got to go to the phones real fast.  Uh-oh.  Before we lose John.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  You're going to bring up something that we talk about all the time on the show, but go ahead.  Well, the way Jimmy wipes, he likes to keep himself nice and clean by wiping that way?  Yes.  Well, the next guy who uses a toilet has to sit down where he just put his foot.  The foot that walked across the bathroom floor through all the pee drip and all the pee tears and grit.  Yeah, you raise a good point, but most of my dumps, 80% of them are done at home or in hotels. 
[03:07:30]  But even so, I'm willy wipe when it comes to the seat, so you've got to wipe the seat off.  That's the next guy's responsibility.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I thought he was going to talk about something else.  Everybody will think about that the next time they go.  You keep yourself perfectly clean, but then you have no problem diving into some whore's ass.  I didn't say there are no inconsistencies.  It amazes me that there are inconsistencies.  Whenever I wipe my chest, I put my foot up.  All right.  Thank you, John. 
[03:08:00]  Thanks.  Bye.  Al the Cop from East Northport has a little story.  At some chick's party back in high school, my bud had a crap that wouldn't fit down the bowl because of its length.  So he took a comb out of the comb and brush holder on the girl's sink, sawed the log in half, rinsed the comb, and put it back.  Oh, that's great.  Nice.  Despicable.  Someone's wondering why they have a peanut in their hair.  That's good.  All right. 
[03:08:30]  So let's try Aaron's Monster Rain song here.  All right.  Give a listen.  It's going to be kind of weird to critique right in front of you.  A little awkward.  We're a lot braver when you guys are at home listening.  That's all right.  It's almost like American Idol.  I probably should have brought some poker chips for you to throw at me.  Oh, they're right there.  Oh, no.  They're right there.  Those are their famous poker chips.  They're just waiting to be used again.  Poker chips aren't dangerous if you can throw them individually.  They have to be in a case like that where you can really do some damage.  Right, Ope?  That's right.  I'm sure we'll replay that when we take a couple days Thursday and Friday. 
[03:09:00]  So here we go.  Aaron from Florida.  Quick, quick, Ope and Anthony.  The Monster Rain's coming.  Get under the porch.  Jim Norton.  Fucking weird like Billy Bob Thornton.  If it wasn't for AA, he'd probably be old snorting.  He's dirty.  Converted.  Got a fucking problem with his brain.  But this all started way back when, when he played Monster Rain.  He's sicker than Ed Gain.  Ed Gain had taken acid. 
[03:09:30]  He looks at pictures of dead hookers to go to heart from flaccid.  But back to the story of where Jimmy went all wrong.  Under porches in the rain, smoking the neighbor's penis bong.  That's right.  He admits it.  Not a shame to say.  Hanging with a good buddy, being gay, under the stairway.  His name is Jimmy Norton.  His act is fucking funny.  But when he was younger, his little friend shot clear stuff on his tongue.  Better hide your kids when little Jimmy comes to town.  Because of XM Radio, now we all know how he gets down.  Even though it's been years, New Jersey kids, they still fear.  When Jimmy Norton comes around, the little tykes, they shed a tear. 
[03:10:00]  So when you wonder why he's sick, had a prank, it's because he sucked a kid's dick.  He just played Monster Rain.  And as a kid there was no school, wasn't cool, under the porch, in a jizz pool.  He just played Monster Rain.  Talking online to chicks, to compensate for tricks, he turned for kicks.  He just played Monster Rain.  This little game was an event, under the porch he went to mouth the kid's tank.  He just played Monster Rain.  At nine years old, Jimmy was left home alone.  This ain't no story about Macaulay Culkin getting boned.  There ain't no Michael Jackson, I had no Neverland Ranch. 
[03:10:30]  Just little Jimmy and his little neighbor doing the cootie dance.  Smoking palms, eating bones, even if they were pre-pubesciled.  And Jimmy took that two inches like a fucking champ.  Going all the way down, wrapped his lips around it tight.  Under the porch is where he'd be fellating day and night.  It's no use to fight, even scream with all your might.  Try and leave before the climax and your ball is he would bite.  With his tiny teeth into your fleshy sack.  And once he crossed the line, man, there was no coming back.  Getting blowjobs in the park, hookah shitting on his chest.  Now we know what that brown smelly stain was on his vest. 
[03:11:00]  Half rapist, half comedian.  Whacking his bag to romp a room while a whore pisses on his throat glands.  So when you see him start to drool, it isn't cool, it's jizz from a kid's tool.  He just played Monster Rain.  Claiming to keep yourself pristine, but as a kid you always smell like chlorine.  He just played Monster Rain.  Telling the girls you think they're hot, but as a kid you ate your friend's white snot.  He just played Monster Rain.  So when the dark clouds that come, you're the only one having fun eating little boys come. 
[03:11:30]  Sick motherfucker.  That's not bad.  I would have to say of all the Monster Rain songs, that was the best written.  Definitely the best lyrics.  That's not bad.  Well, the audience, not digging it.  No?  Not digging it at all.  Let's see.  It's an odd song to do it to, because some of Eminem's songs are very odd beats like that.  And I knew I was taking a chance with Eminem, because it's kind of hard. 
[03:12:00]  If you're not him, it's not going to work out well.  No, no, but if it was like Slim Shady or one of those that had like a faster beat to it,  it probably would have been a little bit easier.  That's one of those little offbeat ones he does.  It's not that bad, though.  I hope he should break his CD, like Steve the Whistler.  This is Awful from Doughboy.  Jim from Boston, Just Terrible, Shut It Off.  Angel Eyes from Philly, Turn It Off, Turn It Off, Turn It Off.  Ed from New Jersey, Does This Guy Have Any Melanin? 
[03:12:30]  Besides for the fact that he can't sing the song, it's great.  This guy is trying too hard to find rhymes and not be white.  This is Awful.  I'd rather poker chip this motherfucker.  Send the wigger on the way.  I'd rather listen to Mario Cantone sing bad show tunes.  All right, so it's a pretty split reaction.  One guy just writes, Slim Shitty. 
[03:13:00]  Slim Shitty.  Let's see.  Has he walked out of the studio yet?  That's from Jim in Boston.  That sucked balls.  Well, you got the people reacting.  We like that on this show.  And Jerry Lee Lewis from Whack Bag saying, I thought it was pretty good.  So, not everybody.  Hey, guys, it really wasn't that bad.  Better than that Neil Diamond shit.  Now we're getting some people going, yeah, it wasn't bad. 
[03:13:30]  They're saying if you know the Eminem song, he did a really good job with it.  Right.  Pretty brave to take on Eminem in a song party like that.  Mike from Cleveland saying, best song so far.  I see that.  It was good.  F the other listeners.  Well, there you go.  Thanks, Ben.  Looks like the early polls were wrong.  No, it's still about 75% hate, 25%.  I'm kind of digging it.  All right, man.  There you go.  I'm more a parody purist, I guess. 
[03:14:00]  This song, eight.  I like the simple ones that just, you know, they sound like another song that you kind  of know.  Yeah.  Get right to the jokes.  And, you know, that one, a little too involved.  We'll be totally honest.  I wasn't so confident in the actual song itself, so I wanted a lot going on, so.  Ah, that's a lot of fun.  I liked the idea, though, of putting the little baby cry in there and little clips and stuff.  That was just for a little Jimmy action.  The mixing was actually very, it was very well mixed.  Yeah.  They're still coming in, Anthony.  Vanilla from Philly.  The song ate more cock than Norton. 
[03:14:30]  Greg from PA.  Give him the chips.  And Brion from Minneapolis.  It was better than listening to you turds talking about your dump process.  All right.  Well, we want to thank Aaron for coming on in.  How old are you, Aaron?  Thank you for letting me in.  I just turned 25 today, Jimmy.  Oh, cool.  Today's your birthday.  Today's my birthday.  Right on, man.  What are you going to do for your birthday?  I'm going to go home and get yelled at about this wedding process I'm in the middle of.  Uh-oh.  Get married?  Enjoy it.  Oh, boy.  You're getting married.  Can I just say that you guys are, I can attribute for the reason I'm getting married. 
[03:15:00]  Why?  Can I blame you guys for this?  What did we do?  Well, because you guys, I was inspired to go to a certain state in this country, and then my fiance  decided to follow me, and then I had to marry her at that point, so.  Oh, you do radio, right?  Uh, no.  No?  Oh, you don't want to mention it?  Looks like he does radio.  There you go.  I can tell a radio guy.  Yeah?  Better than getting raped, I guess.  Toolbag writes.  Better than getting raped.  Play the Hulk song and watch him slink out like a whore.  Oh, my God. 
[03:15:30]  When are you getting married?  I thought maybe it was March.  Where are you going on your honeymoon?  Uh, nowhere yet.  Okay.  Vanilla got it.  He has another one from Philly.  This was the best song.  Just like Corky was the smartest retard on TV.  I thought maybe it was some of our commentary we've done on marriage that got you married.  Well, you know, I play that for my fiancee, and she gets very, very angry and asks me to  turn it off, which is when I turn it up just a little bit.  How long have you been dating this gal?  Six years now. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, that's a while.  Six years.  We've known each other since we were little kids.  You lived together?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  Her parents weren't too happy enough.  Everything goes well, though, with the living together?  Not really, but, you know, most of the time it goes good.  Look, it's not a match made in heaven.  I'll be honest.  If it was, I'd be worried.  But you'd rather have...  No, that's what it should be, sir.  No, but doesn't it...  Aren't you worried that now you're going to have exactly what you got and what you have  living together, except now you'll have a legal binding contract that says that you 
[03:16:30]  will get screwed if anything ever happens?  Yeah, I'm really not worried about losing money in this process.  Yeah, look at him.  He doesn't make money.  Jesus Christ.  I wasn't either, to tell you the truth.  That was a lot of fun back when I was working for $27,000 a year when I got married and  thought, ah, who cares?  She could take half.  Ha ha.  Huddle, huddle.  I'll take half of what she has.  Ha ha ha.  Can I read a couple more of these, Anthony?  Sure.  I can't even pronounce this guy's name, but he writes, Slim Crappy.  Does he know he doesn't have to sing every stanza he comes up with? 
[03:17:00]  Doesn't he?  And then this one is great.  It's Chupa Cabaret, Dirty Spick from Jersey.  It's not bad, provided you get hit in the back of the head with a boat first.  Ha ha ha.  It's probably Chupa Cabra.  That's a Spanish monster.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I'm guessing.  No, you're right.  You're right, actually.  All right.  That's very funny.  So do you want to leave with the Hulk music, or do you just want to leave?  It's up to you guys.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Ha ha.  See if I can find it really quickly.  Yeah.  I don't think I can. 
[03:17:30]  Ah, there we go.  That was kind of quick.  Where's Pablo Francisco when you need him?  That wasn't that bad.  No.  It really wasn't that bad.  These guys are just riding it.  Oh my God, I just saw it.  Are you guys worried about my feelings?  Is that what I'm hearing?  Nah.  Nah, we don't care.  All right, good.  Ha ha ha.  All right.  We want to thank Aaron from Florida for coming in.  Good luck with the marriage.  Yeah.  Good luck with your 25th birthday.  Good luck with your radio career.  Good luck with your radio career.  You guys are doing great. 
[03:18:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're trying.  We're trying again.  Bye, Aaron.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Make sure.  Make sure you get really popular and famous.  Divorce first.  Get a good job.  No, say something on the air that completely screws it up.  Take our advice.  Or just knock her up and take a nice long ride the old fishing boat.  Ha ha ha.  Don't forget the cinder blocks.  There he goes, Aaron.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  He turned around all hoping like he was coming back in for more air time.  And you just turned your head.  They did the game a bit of a harder time than they should.  No, I thought it was pretty good.  I thought it was well written.  I mean.  All right.  There he goes.  From one loser to the next.  Lady Di, what's up?  Oh.  Hey, how's everything?  Actually, Aaron's not a loser.  How are you?  How's it going?  How are you?  Ha ha ha.  Still out there looking for a job?  Yeah, sure you are.  You're pounding the pavement?  Well, at least you sound kind of sober today. 
[03:19:00]  She does that whenever she walks.  I am sober today.  What job are you looking for?  A tequila worm eater?  No.  No.  No, no, no.  Jobs in town.  I'm trying to look like all over the place.  Clothing stores, all that other stuff.  That must be where you are now, right?  Looking for work?  Yeah.  So where are you?  Well, I'm at home right now.  Oh, you're at home right now.  That's where all the jobs are.  Hello, is this Lady Di's house?  Hi, I have a job for you.  I just knock on people's doors. 
[03:19:30]  No, no, no.  We're from the National Rape Prevention Society.  Can you be our spokesperson?  These people have to call me back.  Oh, so you're waiting for the phone to ring?  Well, kind of.  I mean, I could go back there.  I could call them up.  I can go back there.  I have no idea.  You sound a little tipsy.  What?  She sounds a little like...  Did you have maybe a Bloody Mary this morning?  No.  Get things rolling? 
[03:20:00]  I don't have anything.  Nothing better than a Bloody Mary in the morning?  No.  To just set the pace of the whole day.  Because then afternoon, you could start hitting the beers.  And then early evening, that's when you could start hitting the Jack and Cokes.  Yeah.  What did you have to drink so far?  No, it's not like that at all.  Are you still buzzed from last night?  Don't lie.  No.  We don't care.  I'm not buzzed from last night.  You didn't go out last night?  No, I did not.  Where am I going to go?  Do you have a party over your house? 
[03:20:30]  No.  But who was over last night?  Does it make any difference?  Yes, that's why I'm asking.  I had a couple of friends over last night.  What did you do?  Huh?  What did you do besides not shower or exercise?  Oh, Jesus.  I don't believe you guys.  No.  What did you do?  First of all, I shower every day.  I know you do.  In lard.  Now, what did you guys do?  What did you do?  Yeah, I had some people over. 
[03:21:00]  And what did the night consist of?  Well, we had a few drinks, and then that was it.  There you go.  Just a few drinks on a Sunday night.  What time did you go to bed?  When you're unemployed, that makes sense.  Oh, sure.  Well, yes and no.  First of all, your body looks like an elephant leg.  Now, what time did you go to bed?  I don't know, 3 o'clock in the morning?  3 in the morning when you're unemployed on a Sunday night, sure.  And then what time did you get up?  I just got up a little while ago. 
[03:21:30]  All right, so what are you going to do today?  I guess get back out there again and, you know, see if any of these places are going to call me back.  Shouldn't you be out there by now if you're looking for a job?  I think people that are giving jobs kind of want someone that's motivated and is their first thing in the morning.  Not like with booze coming out of their pores from a 3 o'clock, 3.30, 4 o'clock bender the night before.  I understand.  No, you don't, apparently.  No, no, no.  I know what you're talking about.  You've had a lot to drink if you crashed at 3 in the morning. 
[03:22:00]  I agree with you.  All right, Pete has something for you.  Pete, what's up?  Pete.  Hey, gentlemen.  Hey.  Guy, Guy, what's going on, babe?  Hello?  Who's this, Pete?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, what's going on, babe?  You got to get out there.  You got to be a go-getter.  You hear me, Guy?  I got you.  I know what you're talking about.  He's a go-getter when it comes to food.  Yeah, and booze.  Yeah, Guy, you got to get into the program, you got to work the program, you got to kick  the booze. 
[03:22:30]  Or you got to 12-step your ass off a goddamn cliff.  Yeah, last time we talked to you, Lady Di, you said you would stop drinking.  Is Pete an AA?  I don't know.  It doesn't matter if he's an AA.  What about you?  I've been through it, Guy.  Guy, you're an alcoholic, whether you realize it or not.  You are an alcoholic.  Well.  You are.  I don't know what to say about that.  Well, you-  What do you mean?  You told us last week you were going to stop drinking.  Like I said, I don't know what to say about that.  You know you're an alcoholic, don't you? 
[03:23:00]  You need an intervention.  I'm not sure.  Yes, you are.  You really should be sure of that, because you are.  Marion's sure.  Patty's sure.  The boys are sure.  I'm sure.  They're trying to, you know, I know Marion lectures me about this, but Patty, you know, both of them, as a matter of fact, are trying to, you know, look for a job for me.  Right.  Which is not bad.  But, you know, even-  No, see, but you have to clean yourself up, too, you know. 
[03:23:30]  Even Patty doesn't want to put herself out on the line for you, because she knows that you'll screw it up.  No, I wouldn't do that.  Yes, you will, because you screw up everything.  No.  You wouldn't mean to.  Yeah, but, you know, maybe one of those nights, it'd be a little too late with the drinking, you get into the work late.  No.  What do you keep saying-  It wouldn't be like that at all, if I had a job.  It would not be like that.  It's like delusional.  You've got this image.  You really do have blinders on to reality.  Oh, by the way, I don't have a roommate anymore. 
[03:24:00]  I'm by myself again.  What caused this person to commit suicide?  Did you run him over with the train?  You told him to leave.  Why?  Why'd you throw Owen out?  Huh?  Owen.  I told him to leave.  Why?  Did he drink the last beer in the refrigerator?  No.  It has nothing to do with that.  I know.  Well, why did you ask him to leave?  Because he put a pie in my face.  I don't want him around anymore. 
[03:24:30]  Huh?  I did not want him around anymore.  I have an Italian temper, and I did not want him around.  You have an Italian temper?  You have an Italian temper?  Yeah.  Is that a new type of booze?  No.  Italian temper.  An Italian temper.  Yeah.  Oof.  All right, so what did he do wrong?  I don't even want to mention it.  Well, we'd like you to mention it.  You were the one who mentioned it.  I told people I sucked dick under a porch.  You could tell us what your friend did.  Yeah.  Come on.  Why'd you throw him out? 
[03:25:00]  No, he was just being too verbal with me.  Okay?  Did he complain that you spilled his coffee?  What do you mean too verbal?  He was yelling?  Was he yelling things at you?  He was just being bossy.  That's all.  Bossy?  Yeah.  How?  Wasn't he living for free?  Um, well, not exactly.  I mean, he gave my landlord some money, but he didn't, you know, didn't give him enough  money.  So I just said, get lost.  What did he do that pissed you off?  You're dancing around it.  What? 
[03:25:30]  What did he do that upset you?  He was being verbally abusive.  What did he say?  Does it matter?  Yes, I wouldn't have asked.  Come on, enough with this.  Just say it.  No, no, no.  He was being verbally abusive.  What did he say?  Lady Di, you've got to stop calling our show because you don't give us anything.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  He called me retarded, and I couldn't stand that.  It's different when you guys call me retarded.  Right, or anybody else in the country.  I have a roommate that calls me retarded constantly.  You know, that's the end.  What were you doing that obviously was mistaken for retarded behavior? 
[03:26:00]  It doesn't matter.  I would like to know.  It does matter.  Somebody asks you, it matters.  Walking around with that haircut?  I was going to say, damn it, you've got to watch television.  It's my apartment.  Well, maybe if you didn't have a Pete Rose hairdo, he wouldn't call you retarded.  I don't have a Pete Rose hairdo.  You know I don't.  Toolbag Johnson saying, Lady Di could try the 12 steps, but she'd be out of breath after  eight.  Very funny.  No, he was just being too much. 
[03:26:30]  What else did he say?  He didn't just call you.  I can't stand him.  What else did he say?  Tell us the truth.  Stay here.  You hit on him, and he rejected you?  No.  Oh, that sounds like something that might have happened.  You sat there with your awful legs on maybe a pair of shorts and tried to get him to seduce  him?  No.  Not at all.  All right.  Let's go to Pete from Queens.  We've got to move on here.  Pete?  Yo.  How's it going, boys?  Good.  What's up?  Pete?  Listen, Lady Di, Long Island is hiring centers on Horse Block Road in Farmingville. 
[03:27:00]  You can stand there with all the other Mexicans.  What?  She doesn't get anything.  A day laborer.  If you want to enjoy the Lady Di phone calls, just notice that she's clueless about everything  you throw at her.  And you don't answer questions, honestly.  I'm saying what this guy said.  He didn't just call you retarded.  What else happened?  You beat him around the bush.  Well, that right there is enough damage.  No, it's not.  Lady Di, this could be your last appearance on the show.  Oh, no.  Danny, what's up?  Oh, my God.  Get this fat pig off the radio, please. 
[03:27:30]  Dude, I'm just trying to figure some stuff out.  Oh.  Oh, what the heck do you have in today?  I'm just trying to figure some stuff out.  All right.  I suck.  I'm just trying to figure some stuff out.  I'm talking like a woman who's just got her mouth wired shut, like Jake LaMotta's wife.  I told him, I suck like my cock in the neighborhood.  I just tried to figure some stuff out.  Oh.  No.  That was great.  What an ass I am. 
[03:28:00]  Your tongue just duking it out with your teeth.  It really did.  Losing the battle.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jim.  Yeah.  You know, when is going to be your next appearance in New York?  Right after you tell me truthfully exactly what this guy said to you that bothered you  so much.  I just told you.  No, you didn't.  I'd grab you by the hair and throw you to the ground if I didn't think you'd slip out.  He calls you retarded.  He does it under his breath and he freaking annoys me.  All right.  What else does he do?  Listen, slug body.  What else does he do that bothers you?  Tell me the truth.  What else does he do?  Like, when will he call you retarded? 
[03:28:30]  What to do?  When will he call you retarded?  Under his breath, he thinks I'm sleeping and I'm not sleeping.  Oh, that's funny now.  He'll call me all kinds of names under his breath.  Like, what else?  Now we're getting somewhere.  I can see her asleep.  She's just nodding off in between Budweiser's and...  Yeah.  No.  Look at you, you fat lump of shit just laying there.  I can't sleep on the couch.  Wait, he talks...  And he gets on my freaking case about that.  Wait, he talks to you and he thinks you're sleeping?  He just mumbles at you? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, he does.  What else does he say besides retarded?  You just said all kinds of names.  All kinds of names.  Like what?  Like you're fucking this and that and that and that, you know.  No, I don't know.  Fucking this and that and that.  I don't know.  What did he say?  Jesus, quote the guy.  She laughs like an idiot.  I'm a fucking imbecile, this and that, and I hear all this stuff.  What else?  Imbecile.  Imbecile, retarded.  What else?  Those are not that bad, Di.  Isn't that enough? 
[03:29:30]  No, I've been called an imbecile.  I think that's enough for him to get out of here.  What else did he...  He said something that really got to you and you haven't said it yet.  Yep.  I told you, retarded.  No, it didn't get to you.  T-Bones from Boston.  Did he mistake...  It got to me a couple of times.  Did he mistake you for the fridge when he was trying to grab another beer?  Joe from Miami saying he was bossy and then in quotes,  Hey, Di, stop grabbing my cock.  No, I would never grab his period.  He is not my type.  Bossy like get a job, bossy?  What is your type? 
[03:30:00]  What's my type?  Yeah.  A nice looking guy, you know, that would respect me.  Did he comment...  I guess I'm not going to find that right now.  Let me ask you a question.  Did he comment that when you were laying on your back on the couch,  you look like that thing that Richard Dreyfuss made in his living room  in Close Encounters?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  This means something.  It's not like that at all.  I don't know what it means.  This means something.  I have to make it out of mashed potatoes and it smells like alcohol. 
[03:30:30]  No, it's not like that at all.  Alex from PA, police saw this unfunny alcoholic jizz dumpster in half with a comb.  No, shut up.  Tell me shut up.  God.  He just called her a big toilet clogging piece of shit.  He used to get all my kids for me sleeping on the freaking couch instead of the bedroom.  You know, and Sean, shut up.  Sean from Philly, he writes,  who would call an unemployed alcoholic a retard? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Does she mention that when she is sleeping these times,  she's passed out in the fucking driveway?  Did it bother him that you put on a little mustache  and got punched in the face on the floor of the Pacers-Pistons game?  No.  Because he doesn't know anything about that.  Well, did it bother him that when you put on glasses,  you fouled up that Cubs chance at the playoff  by reaching over and grabbing that foul ball?  No. 
[03:31:30]  All right.  Just wondering what else he mumbled at you while you were sleeping.  Oh, no.  Nothing like that.  Nothing like that.  Did he call you the C word?  Huh?  Oh, that's the truth.  Come on, tell us the truth.  Did he call you the C word?  No, he didn't do that.  Mm-hmm.  Did he comment?  He never called me anything like that.  Did you read the one?  I'm not sure.  Yeah, the lady dies looking for a guy that will shoot.  No, I didn't.  J.D. and ice cream from his colleague.  No.  Who said that? 
[03:32:00]  Vanilla Thunder from Philly.  T.Borone wants to know if you sleep standing up.  Did he remark on how you spray-painted yourself black  and beat the Yankees with two extra inning home runs this year?  Oh, will you stop with that already?  I wasn't ready to say that it was.  Wait, do you?  All right, hold on.  What was Jim referring to right there?  I don't know.  He said something about Yankees.  She has no clue.  Why does that bother you?  Just because they retired your number three jersey? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, that bothers me.  What number three jersey?  Do you know what he's referring to there?  I'm calling you Babe Ruth body.  I'm saying that you have small legs and a fat upper body.  You run in fast motion.  Oh, God.  No, I don't have a Babe Ruth body.  You wear a little fat baseball glove.  All right.  Yeah, that's it.  You've got to stop drinking.  That's baseball.  And that's step one.  You've just got to stop drinking.  Justin from Long Island.  Di's new roommates are Jack Daniels and Jimmy Bean. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  I wish.  Why would you wish that?  Why?  Oh, sure.  Because I would drink them away.  Your giggle is bugging everyone because it's not genuine.  You're not telling us the truth.  We're very truthful on this show.  I know.  You've got to tell the truth sometimes.  What did this guy?  This guy said something that really bugged you.  And it wasn't just he mumbled retort.  I told you.  No, you didn't.  You told us the surface, but not what really bothered you.  Andrew Long saying, 
[03:33:30]  Pasters, Pistons, Jimmy.  Tongue, zero, teeth, 35.  Did I say Pasters, Pistons?  I don't think I did.  Pasters?  Oh, maybe I did.  It's possible.  It's okay.  Hey, T-Bone again.  He's on fire.  Sleep on the couch?  Bitch, you are the couch.  No, I fall asleep on the couch because I have my cable television over here I don't have in my room.  And a bottle in your hand?  A bottle.  No.  Yes.  I just have like a little, you know, a television set and I watch TV. 
[03:34:00]  We have a little flask on your chest?  Lady Di, all kidding aside, you know, you really got to get help.  We've been telling you this for weeks now.  You've got some serious problems.  Well, you know, I guess I have to agree with you because I have no idea.  Charlie Murphy checking in.  Did her roommate get sick of putting peanut butter in her mouth to get her to talk?  No, he put peanut butter on his banana.  What does that mean?  A banana.  You know, like when you peel a banana, a fruit. 
[03:34:30]  That's what he did yesterday.  Way to take humor and make it literal.  Yeah, that's a good one.  No.  It will never happen.  When are you going to stop drinking?  Why don't you just admit that you have a problem?  I have no idea.  What is it going to take?  Huh?  Hold on.  Jimmy wants in here.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  Where's Jimmy?  I said hold on. 
[03:35:00]  He did.  Jim in Brooklyn.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  I got about a year more than Jimmy.  Okay?  I am willing to take time off from work to take her into rehab.  He's 12-stepping you if you want to go.  Diane, you want to go into rehab?  I will take time off from work, and I will get you in rehab.  He's 12 steps to just walk around her.  I live in Brooklyn.  I don't care.  I'll come to Jersey. 
[03:35:30]  He wants to help.  Okay.  You want to help me?  That's fine.  Diane, do you want it?  Do you want it for you, or do you want it for them?  Do you want it for you, or do you want it for them?  I want it for everybody.  Do you want to get sober?  I want it for everybody.  No, Diane, do you want it for you?  I'm not sure yet.  You're not sure yet?  Then what am I going to waste my time for?  Drinking is fun. 
[03:36:00]  You've got to admit it.  Up to a certain point, but then when you're just laying on the couch  and you catch someone who you think is your friend mumbling,  you fat whore, I hope you're dead.  You realize it's affecting people adversely.  And this guy's offering to come take his time off from work  and take you to a rehab and drop you off and see what you can do.  You have my phone number.  Give it to him.  Well, maybe he'd want to call you.  I don't know if you'd want you to have his number.  Why don't you just agree to go?  And don't put it off.  You have nothing else to do.  We'll give you his number, and you decide if the guy's normal and all that. 
[03:36:30]  And if you want to take him up on it.  Okay.  There you go.  It'll be your choice.  All right.  That sounds good.  Jim knows the deal.  He probably won't hear from you.  Well, you know, I don't know.  Jim, Jim.  He's probably off the line right now.  You want Jim?  Oh, Jim.  Hold on.  I had to switch screens.  Jim.  Damn it, Jim.  Yeah.  Give her the number.  You got it off the call already, right?  We'll get it.  No, hold on a minute.  She seems like the type that just is not ready, right? 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like to me.  Jim, you remember when you were ready, right, Jim?  Oh, to be honest with you, man, when I, this is why, like, if someone, when I went into  the, I got, let's see, I got clean and sober, it was basically just to kind of save a relationship  I was in, but then something caught on.  So once in a while, you can walk in, and the motor's being a little odd, and all of a  sudden, hear something that changes your whole outlook, and then you stay for the right  reasons.  So, Di, if you're willing to go, if you don't stay, you don't stay, but it will at least  ruin your drinking. 
[03:37:30]  That's the one thing it definitely does.  What's that?  Can I ask you a question?  All right.  What made you change and go into, you know, whatever you, did you go into rehab?  Uh, well, I was forced into rehab after a suicide attempt, uh, attempt.  I didn't want to, uh, go to rehab, but I was forced into it.  A year later, I drank for another year.  Yeah.  I gotta catch a bus.  And then, uh, a year later, I actually, uh, I just started, I just started going, I 
[03:38:00]  don't want to say what, for anonymity purposes, but I did start doing, attending a 12-step  program, and, uh, it just kind of caught on.  I'm like, you know, I don't know how it caught on, but it did.  I just showed up, and it kind of happened.  But showing up is the most important thing.  I mean, what did you do?  Just wake up one day and say, I didn't help?  The day, the day that you'll go, ah, this is a great day to quit, that day never comes.  You never wake up thinking, this is a fantastic day.  There's always reservations, and like, well, this kind of sucks, maybe I should wait a while.  Just go, just show up. 
[03:38:30]  Just show up.  Well, here's a guy that's been clean for six years.  He wants in.  Tom from New York.  Go ahead.  Hey.  Hey.  Please, please, I'll pin this guy.  Please do not take us through the program.  I am not listening to that.  I am not going to sit in the fucking meeting and listen to that.  She's going to drive everyone to drink.  Punch it out.  All right.  So, yeah, the old expression.  Hey, who was that?  It doesn't matter.  Some guy.  It was Bill Wilson.  Just bring the body, bring the body, and the mind will follow, as they say. 
[03:39:00]  All right, Lady Di, hold on a minute.  Okay.  The body's got to go on two trips anyway.  We're going to give Jim your, no, we'll give you Jim's phone number.  We'll see what happens with this.  In her case, it's bring the body, and the mind and much-needed Viagra will follow.  All kidding aside, though, Lady Di, we really like to have fun on this show.  And maybe a joke book could follow so I can read out of it.  We were just letting it simmer. 
[03:39:30]  Go to a low, bubbling simmer.  Yeah, that was awful.  Lady Di.  Yes.  We like to have a lot of fun on this show, and we get serious hair once in a while.  I'm not kidding, man.  You need help.  I don't know what to say.  Just say, yeah, you'll take a shot.  She doesn't want to commit to even admitting that she's a mess.  No, no, no, no, I'm not saying I don't want to commit.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying you don't even want to commit to saying you're a mess.  You know you are, though.  You know it.  You walk around your apartment thinking, all right, I just got to get my shit together. 
[03:40:00]  Like, you know, this will be okay.  You keep planning and planning, and the day never comes.  And a day turns into a week, turns into a month, and nothing changes.  You're just languishing miserably without a job and drinking.  By the way, Johnny from Philly, how many steps does it take to get under the Monster Rain porch, Jimmy?  Depending on how far away, when one of us would get a little tent in his underwear and yell Monster Rain.  Could have been two, could have been 30.  It was all well worth it.  A lot of liquor store owners crying right now, Anthony.  They're going to lose a lot of business if Lady Di goes into the program. 
[03:40:30]  All right, Lady Di, we've got to let you be.  Okay.  Well, am I ever going to get that phone number?  Yeah, yeah.  You get it off.  We're not going to give it out on the air.  We'll give it to you off the air.  She's on hold.  And just call the guy and talk, even if you don't go.  Just call him.  Let's step aside and try to bring the funny back into the program.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva. 
[03:41:00]  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to have a diva.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  You betcha. 
[03:41:30]  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  Grand 36.  ACC football.  ACC football.  The ACC today.  Maryland.  Virginia.  UNC.  Duke.  MC State.  Wake Forest.  Georgia Tech.  Clemson.  FSU.  And new to the ACC.  Virginia Tech.  And Miami.  It's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio. 
[03:42:00]  It's Monday, the 22nd of November, 2004.  I'm Ari Bikowski with the ACC Today.  Well, the Palmetto State Showdown in South Carolina and Clemson.  They were playing a game and then it got ugly.  Gamecocks turning over on down to the Tigers.  And now there's a scramble and a little bit of a brawl going on.  You see Gaines, Adams, and Gruber involved in that.  The bench of South Carolina starts to come out.  Here comes the bench of Clemson.  Lou Holtz is in the middle of things trying to break things up. 
[03:42:30]  Now away from where the initial action was.  There's another scramble.  Gamecocks and Tigers pushing each other.  I see one of the big Clemson offensive linemen, Nick Richardson, involved.  Now you've got Nathan Bennett.  This is happening off to our right as the action's kind of moving down toward the hill.  Almost an all-out bench is clearing brawl.  They've got the police out there now trying to break things up.  The initial disturbance happened around the 40, around the area where Newton was knocked down  and he remains on the ground.  Now perilously they get closer to that hill end zone as a lot of the skirmish has moved into the end zone. 
[03:43:00]  And less than 12 hours after there was a most ugly incident in the NBA,  you've got to think that this is mighty scary based on the emotion and attention.  Clemson Tiger Radio Network, a division of Learfield Sports and ISP Sports, on the broadcast.  Oh, by the way, Clemson takes out South Carolina 29-7.  Clemson is now bowl eligible.  UNC and Duke.  UNC is going to a bowl game after a little bit of a sluggish start.  They take out Duke 40-17.  Also an important game for Virginia. 
[03:43:30]  They look to bounce back after losing to Miami.  Pretty big win for the Wahoos, 30-10 over Georgia Tech.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.

[03:46:00]  Now we've seen the video 50 times.  The fight.  The NBA fight, of course.  Hey, we got one more thing to talk about before we get out of here today, Anthony.  Yes.  Oh, my gosh.  Wow.  Now time flew today.  It sure did.  What's up with the JFK game?  It was, what, 41 years ago today that JFK was assassinated down there in Dallas, Texas.  Huh?  What?  Oh, sorry.  I was trying to choose between Weapons of Ass Destruction 3. 
[03:46:30]  Jules Jordan?  Yes.  Hellcats 5.  How was the Hellcats series?  They're all...  Anything from Evil Angel is great, so...  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm going to take Weapons of Ass Destruction.  We got a new selection of...  From Yoshi, right?  Of porn that came out.  Yeah, Yoshi gives us a pile of porn every week at this point.  I'll make sure you guys get some tranny ones, too.  But Slavari does the best tranny stuff, if you want.  That's all right.  How's the Nicky Sterling stuff?  I'm sure it's great.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Voyeur 5.  That's probably John Leslie, I think, directs those. 
[03:47:00]  What the hell is this one?  Or is it Randy West?  That was John Leslie.  Perfect Specimens 2.  Evil Angels.  Ooh, Girls...  Beautiful Girls 10.  Nudes a-poppin'.  Those are probably...  I'm sure they're all good.  There's boring names.  Animal Trainer.  Uh, the quality of these is great, though.  Fatty Girls 4.  It looks like black chicks with big asses.  I like big...  Yeah.  All right.  They have the, uh... 
[03:47:30]  Every porn guy wants to be a member of Evil Angel.  They're very picky who they let in.  There you go.  I picked out some.  Ben, if you'd like one, they have...  I still haven't gone through all the ones you gave us last week.  Uncombed hair series.  There you go.  I have, like, two dozen from, um...  Two weeks ago.  Still getting through.  Dude, I must have 300 of these.  I just will pop one in once in a while and scrap to it.  It's fantastic.  Crank.  All right.  Yeah, the last story of the day, Anthony. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  The JFK game.  I can't wait to try this.  It's gonna be a...  Thanks.  It's gonna cost, like, $9.99 or something for a download.  It's downloadable off the web, and, uh, it's a game where you play Lee Harvey Oswald up  on the sixth floor of the book suppository building.  Knock it off!  And, uh, you have to pick off JFK in the time that, uh, Lee Harvey had to fire his shots, 
[03:48:30]  and you have to be accurate.  You can't hit, uh, you can't hit the first lady there.  You can't hit Jackie.  And, uh, it's kinda, you know, it tests your skill, and people are outraged.  You know, it's funny.  The makers of this game, the release of JFK, Reload is Time to Coincide with Today's 41st  Anniversary of the, uh, Assassination in Dallas, was designed, these guys trying to cover their  ass, was designed to demonstrate that a lone gunman was able to kill the president.  Designed to demonstrate.  Oh, so it's an educational thing. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  And they actually make it look like they're actually backing the Warren Commission's horse shit?  I think so, yeah.  That's good.  Uh, Kennedy's, Ted Kennedy is, is pretty much outraged, which, you can't blame him.  Yeah, of course not.  I mean, if they made a, if your brother dies and they make a video game out of it, it's  a little rough.  How do you think, you know, well, they should make a video game, uh, about his, you know.  Oh, now that would be fun.  You gotta drive the car, Miss Chappaquinnick.  It'd be like those little water things, you hit, you push the little button, shh, and 
[03:49:30]  the little ring goes up in the water, little, shh, and whish.  Do you know which ones I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course, of course.  You squish the little thing and the ring goes and you gotta make it go over the little horns  and whatnot.  So what, it's not a video game.  So what, you download this game?  Yeah.  For $9.99?  Yes.  It says each shot can be replayed in slow motion,  and the bullets can be tracked as they travel and pass through Kennedy's digitally recreated body.  Did Governor Connolly in the front seat?  Oh, yeah, it's all the same, the same limo. 
[03:50:00]  The graphics are really good.  It looks like a very top-of-the-line graphics program they use.  How about James Tay getting hit with a piece of concrete,  which proved that there had to be a different, that was a big problem.  True, true.  Caught a piece of shrapnel in the face.  I don't know how involved they'll get with all that.  I think it's pretty much just a thrill game.  You know, they'd like to think it's something educational,  but like I said, if your brother is killed and then they make a video game of it.  They're kind of making some video games out of some stuff that's a little too recent. 
[03:50:30]  No, the company that made this game also made State of Emergency.  Remember that game?  That wasn't very good.  That company wanted us to get behind State of Emergency, and we just couldn't do it for them.  It wasn't that good a game.  They really wanted us to just talk highly about this game.  They were trying to make it like a GTA.  It was awful.  State of Emergency was awful.  I hated that game.  What's the new one that you said that they're making fun of too soon now?  There was one, there's a whole series of them now, the Black Hawk Down. 
[03:51:00]  It's like, eh, I felt a little weird.  I played it, but I felt a little weird playing it because I had just recently seen the movie.  It's a video game, and the Americans died pretty tragically there, and really their bodies were abused.  And then you make a game out of it.  It was a good game.  I enjoyed playing it because think of the content of the game.  It was fun.  You're just shooting away.  Hey, sorry.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  That one guy.  Skinny's on the roof. 
[03:51:30]  The guy Durant with the helicopter.  I'm actually reading his book.  There's one scene, I think they show it in Black Hawk Down, where the guy, the one, the guy they captured alive,  where he gets bashed in the face with a rifle butt.  But the fact was, he was bashed in the face with a severed arm.  Like, they had ripped the arm, and he kept that quiet for a long time out of respect for them.  He didn't want the other soldiers' families to hear that.  But they had attacked the mob so awfully, and they attacked and ripped off one of the dead soldiers' arms.  And the guy tried to kill him with a severed arm. 
[03:52:00]  And he said that when the guy hit his face, he broke his eye socket.  Oh, my God.  And he said, I glared back at this guy, and there must have been such pure hate that the guy just kind of blinked and walked away.  Like, he didn't hit him again with the, uh...  Americans were trying to feed them, and they were attacking American soldiers.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I think Adid, the warlord, ugh, just...  That's why it was a little weird, like, that kind of game is a little weird.  It's too recent.  I think if, you know, you put out a first-person shooter about Fallujah, it'll be a little weird.  Yeah, you don't need to.  Soldiers dying. 
[03:52:30]  But eventually...  But as time goes on, that's the whole trick with entertainment and games and movies.  Enough time goes by, and it becomes perfectly acceptable.  The JFK thing, still a little too close.  You know, I think if it was, you know, a Lincoln thing, it wouldn't get as much of an outrage, you know?  But Kennedy, kind of recent history.  And it goes back to what we used to talk about, that goddamn, the ultimate, the ultimate...  You get your kids, you climb up. 
[03:53:00]  And you slide down the deck, bouncing off the smokestacks and stuff. 
[03:53:30]  And then you end up in the water, in a little pool that's at the bottom.  And you laugh, and the little kids run around and want to do it again.  This is a tragedy that happened long enough ago, I guess, where people could make fun of it.  It was, you know, thousands died, or at least, you know, a thousand and a half.  A thousand and a half years later is reduced to a blow-up carnival attraction. 
[03:54:00]  Enough time goes by.  Someday, we said it before, someday, maybe.  And what's, you know, a lot of people died horrifically on the Titanic, and it's a carnival ride.  Who's to say years from now you won't have a World Trade Center drop ride?  You know, that's like the MGM, they have the ride down there in Orlando.  The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.  You know, who's to say that?  It won't be the Twin Towers of Terror.  Something like that. 
[03:54:30]  It's just enough time.  Enough time goes by.  You're reduced...  Your death is reduced to a carnival attraction.  To a kid's ride.  A kiddie ride.  One step above that big balloon full of drooled-on balls that the kids bounce around in.  That's what your life is.  How do we get to this JFK game online?  I don't know.  I hate when the news does that.  They don't print the site.  You could dig it up, I'm sure.  I wanted to find the game, and nobody was saying where it was. 
[03:55:00]  Hunting Online?  Have you read about this?  A listener brought that up last week.  Remote-controlled hunting online.  Already, the site has a target shooting.  Get this.  You log on, you subscribe, you've got to pay, and you can aim a rifle that's on this remote-controlled  mechanism with your mouse and shoot at targets with a real rifle.  I've seen a demo film of it.  Wow.  Pretty cool.  Now they're going to stock this land with various animals, and you will hunt with your 
[03:55:30]  mouse online and shoot these animals.  That's genius.  And they are animal rights activists, hunters, the state, because I believe it's in Texas,  and Texas now is trying to make a law.  You know, there's no law against this.  They can't figure out anything on the books to stop this.  So they want to make a law that says you have to be within a certain amount of distance  alive from the animal that you're killing.  But they haven't passed this law, so these guys go ahead with this.  So let's take it to the next step. 
[03:56:00]  Let's say there's some guy out there.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Who's responsible?  I guess you would be.  But you didn't actually pull the trigger.  I know.  It opens up a whole big can of worms, doesn't it?  It sounds very dangerous to me anyway.  You couldn't have the thing swinging around 360 degrees.  You know, what about the guy that's just watching the whole stuff, everything happen?  I'd love to see one of those mounted in Times Square.  How great would that be?  Oh, imagine you could just log on and pick off a tourist. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  Some fat chick with her socks tucked in looking up at a building.  Someone giving some money to the naked cowboy.  Oh, I'm tired of him already.  Shoot the naked cowboy.  Jesus, him with his perfect ass.  We get it.  I saw coming out of the Javits Center for one of those conventions.  Digital Life or whatever we do.  I walk out.  I'm going to get my truck, which is parked across the street.  And the naked cowboy is standing there with a woman. 
[03:57:00]  He's standing there still with his naked cowboy underwear on.  He's a guy here in Times Square that makes a living with a cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and underwear on.  And he plays a guitar.  And he calls himself the naked cowboy.  And the women lose their shit on this guy.  The women love it.  They take pictures with him.  They give him money.  And this is how this guy makes his money.  He's kind of one of these legends in Times Square.  He's standing there with some woman.  He's waiting for his car.  His parked car.  And he's still naked.  He's still in his underwear standing there. 
[03:57:30]  But he's looking at his wife's watch because he's not wearing one.  He's just waiting for his car.  And tourists and stuff that don't know who he is because he's not in Times Square anymore are looking like, what the hell is this guy?  Why is he wearing a cowboy hat and underwear waiting for his car?  Is his wife hot?  Yeah.  She was dressed up, too, in something like a bikini.  Oh, really?  Something like she has a gig.  He wears, like, wrestler underwear pants.  Like, those short...  I'm sure he'd be naked if he could.  Well, we heard from him.  He has to wear...  He came in once.  He has to wear, like, three pairs of underwear because one pair showed too much of his junk. 
[03:58:00]  So you can't even see the outline of his junk.  And then some of the women from, you know, the Midwest, they get so crazy, they start pulling at his underwear in the middle of Times Square.  Oh, he didn't get...  It wasn't the city.  And they didn't want to get arrested for...  For having that...  Yeah, it's some kind of law.  You can't show your outline of your junk or something.  All right, Anthony.  I don't know about that.  I'd love to...  Anthony, what did we learn today on the show?  We learned anything.  It was pretty educational.  Fast Eddie, I learned Daryl Hammond is a friend of Jimmy's.  Biv Biv from WhackBag.com.  I learned today that racism is the new gay. 
[03:58:30]  Dan from PA.  I learned that Norton likes the whole passage clean.  Mike from Jersey.  Today, I learned that Boston is very organized.  Doughboy from WhackBag.com.  Think of all the poor...  Oh, we did that one already.  Okay.  Chris from Boston.  Sorry about that.  I learned Opie is back to being regular and Monster Rain is slowly becoming this generation's free bird.  Monte from the Bronx.  I learned that Hitler was over-criticized.  And little Jimmy wants a picture with him.  Toolbag from New Orleans.  Today, I learned that Norton's ball sack is like a hornet's nest when he has the crunch in the freezing XM bathrobe. 
[03:59:00]  That was really good.  Hey, by the way, did you go in there and put elastics all on the windows?  Is that you?  Somebody's got elastics now all over the windows in there.  Like that's going to stop.  I just took him right off and opened the window.  Of course you did.  Rob from Long Island.  What did you learn on the show today?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  How you doing, sweetie?  Hi, fella.  Hey, okay.  I learned two things.  I learned that on Jimmy's spare time, he's a logger.  And I learned that the little dildo's shadow this morning is going to be six more weeks of winter. 
[03:59:30]  Oh, very good.  That wasn't bad for the replay, by the way, if people are just tuning in.  Sarah was good.  Sarah was pretty good, yes.  Duke from Jersey, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Big Duke 6.  Hi, Helen.  Hi.  Helen.  Helen.  Wow, that's good.  Good callback, bro.  Helen.  This guy's loving it.  I learned Jimmy Norton is still bitter about not getting paid, about not getting his raise. 
[04:00:00]  You're right.  See you.  All right.  Bye.  Helen.  Helen.  Yeah, well, frumpy, broad.  Frosted hair doing my plate.  Oh, you had the worst little fantasies.  Chris, what's going on?  I learned that little Jimmy strikes the Captain Morgan pose while he wipes.  Yeah.  Captain Morgan pose.  That's good.  Midgets bind each other in a world of knees and slacks.  Very nice.  Thank you, buddy.  Bye, fella.  Hey, we got MiFi's to give away.  When does that start? 
[04:00:30]  Ooh.  We're going to have like a MiFi day or something to give away?  Nice.  All right.  We'll have details on that maybe tomorrow.  Portable XM.  And also tell all your friends, the cheap bastards that can't either, well, maybe they're not cheap.  Maybe they just can't afford the radio show.  That's cheap.  The online streaming is going to stay.  We won that battle.  Yes.  You go to xmradio.com and you can sign up to listen to the Opie and Anthony show online.  And by the way, I got to plug the other companies.  Sirius is giving away their free portable units and it's being sponsored by a bunch of chiropractors. 
[04:01:00]  That's pretty good.  Not bad.  I liked it.  It was all right.  Their whole promotional slogan is, it's smaller than Lady Di.  All right.  You know what?  Let's just get out of here.  I don't think so.  I'll have some more stuff I want to talk about.  Like what?  I don't know.  Like?  My big audition today?  Oh, yeah.  Good luck with that.  Good luck.  Break a leg.  I hope so.  Give us one line from it.  Go ahead.  Let me hear you. 
[04:01:30]  Max?  Got to be Max Long.  Oh, I like that.  It was natural.  Not bad.  Max?  Got to be Max.  I guess they're asking you about Max Long.  And here's the one thing.  Trudy's real hot right now.  And then Benson says, she's also 15, which means this is child porn.  And I go, hey, I didn't produce it.  Hey.  Hey.  I didn't produce it.  I even put the hands up.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I didn't produce it.  Rachel.  Someone remind us tomorrow to ask Jimmy about his audition today, okay?  Mr. Faber-Sham, that's kiddie porn. 
[04:02:00]  All right.  Let's get out of here.  You can play that New York thing you play when we're short.  But it's like 10, well, we got seven seconds.  The real next bit of dialogue I want to get to.  Is it five or four?  Three, two, or one?  Bye.  See ya.  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive dick show?  The Opinality Show.  Truck drivers, anyone drive trucking here?  Everybody has done.  Everybody has? 
[04:02:30]  No, I think you're the only one who has you fucking road-clogging blood clot in the artery  of the highways of you fucking think you own the road.  I hope every one of you dies a miserable, like, Ebola virus death where you bleed out of  your eyes and all your guts liquefy and shoot out your ass, you fucking, I mean, you do  42 miles an hour and 70 mile an hour's on, but then shitbag number two, he can do 42 and  a half, so he swings it on out now then, neck and neck, and the race is on, and just as 
[04:03:00]  he's about to pass, shitbag number one spills his coffee all over his porno magazine, jacks  it up a notch, and neck and neck, this one's hallucinating from 36 hours on truck stop speed.  Who do you get beyond, dude?  Do you get beyond the one blowing black smoke down your lungs, or the one slinging liquid  pig shit out of the back of his rig all over your windshield?  I don't know.  I have tapes of the Reginald Denny beating, that truck driver in the L.A. riots, I have 
[04:03:30]  videotape that I beat off to, ladies and gentlemen.  I try to time it right once I come, right while he's getting hit in the head with a brick.  Miserable.  Oh, I, maybe I just, ugh.  It's hard enough, I don't know if you've ever driven across this state, it's hard enough  at 90 miles an hour, much less 42 and a half.  I'm just trying to help, that's my job.  Not like that Dr. Ruth bitch, fuck God, she's off the fucking air, Jesus.  Does she drive you nuts?  I don't know why people took her seriously 
[04:04:00]  She doesn't even have a pussy  She has no fucking pussy, man  That pussy's got to be gone  Give me a break  I'm just assuming  I could be way off  I'm sure there's something down there  That pee comes out of  But you wouldn't recognize it  You can take a picture of Dr. Ruth's pussy  Put it up to four other pictures of pussies  And bring a guy in and go  Listen, what do you see? 
[04:04:30]  The guy would come in and go  Let's see, it looks like you have  Four pictures of pussy  And a picture of a really bad grilled cheese sandwich  Or something there  Jesus Christ  Oh God, that's not the wrong  Oh, fuck  Oh, oh  Fucking asshole  Oh, yeah  I know people go  Oh, Jesus, a grilled cheese sandwich  Well  That's family entertainment  Because you can talk about a grilled cheese sandwich 
[04:05:00]  Oh, you think I'm funny  Yeah, you think it's funny  Wait till you see the next one  Wait till you see the next fucking grilled cheese sandwich  You're gonna see  You're gonna pee your fucking pants, man  You're gonna see grilled cheese sandwich  Go  That's what he was talking about  Look at  Look at the cheese  Look at the cheese  It looks just like her  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio  XM Satellite Radio  Radio to the power of X

[04:09:00]  No one truly wants our radio show. 
[04:09:30]  No one has balls in here.  Your balls are showing.  Big, beefy, hanging, swinging nuts.  Throw the second switch!  Wow, this is even better than I imagined!  Love you, Alfie.  Love you, Anthony.  Boy, we're gonna have great fun.  Love you, Ben.  Love you, Steve.  I hope you brought a big bag of smiles.  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  You two are going to hell.  Shut up.  Kill yourself.  Throw the third switch!  Only an enemy.  The virus is spreading.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. </pre>
