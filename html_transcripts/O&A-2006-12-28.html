<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heavily edited compilation of Jim Norton’s early appearances, featuring chaotic and vulgar phone calls where Norton made numerous sexually explicit jokes.  Dice Clay also participated in these calls, engaging in insults and banter.  The segment was punctuated by technical difficulties and the hosts’ reactions to Norton’s humor.  Anthony recounted a frustrating morning trying to leave for work due to his girlfriend's family's visit and car troubles. There was also discussion about a conflict with Howard Stern and promotion of "Wow" stickers. XM Radio advertisements aired throughout.

Next, a National Geographic Channel promo about hospital disaster preparedness was followed by a segment featuring two female “squirters” as guests.  The hosts detailed a plan to have the women squirt Big A in the face after drawing a bullseye on him with lipstick. Big A agreed, on the condition he wouldn't be touched. The segment involved explicit descriptions of various sexual acts and the guests' experiences in the adult film industry. The women proceeded to squirt Big A, and the aftermath was discussed in detail.  The show then transitioned to commercials and a conversation with Danny Bonaduce.

Bonaduce recounted anecdotes from his career, including living in his car behind Grauman's Chinese Theatre, his game show hosting experiences, the international success of *Breaking Bonaduce* (including a drunken limousine escapade), and his current relationship with his wife, including a doctor-mediated sex schedule.  The hosts repeatedly mispronounced his name, culminating in a slapstick mousetrap bit. Bonaduce's wife called in briefly.  The discussion then shifted to a news story about a woman crashing into a moose, followed by anecdotes about perverts and inappropriate behavior by professionals.

A subsequent segment focused on the definition of an “apple fritter,” leading to a chaotic phone call to Starbucks, which ended with a racist rant from a caller and a claim that a staff member, Sam, was hit in the mouth with the phone.  This was followed by the playing of clips from 1950s sex education films, featuring frank discussions of sex, masturbation, menstruation, and homosexuality, presented with the societal biases of the era. Comedian Bob Kelly called in to recount an awkward encounter with Jerry Seinfeld.

The show then featured "No Filter Paul," where Paul, wearing only a diaper and sneakers, walked down 57th Street. The hosts documented New Yorkers' reactions.  After the walk, and following Bob Kelly's Seinfeld story and XM radio ads, Paul, having taken a laxative, was made to do exercises.  Comedian Rich Voss performed a poorly received stand-up set at Starbucks.  Back at the studio, Paul defecated in his diaper, an event captured on camera and shared with the PalTalk audience.  The hosts used highly offensive language and made numerous crude jokes throughout.

The broadcast concluded with a recap of Paul's bowel movement,  including vivid details. Listeners called in with their reactions.  A listener-submitted Pulp Fiction-style remix using lines from sportscaster Pat Battle, created by Danny, Than, and Travis, was played.  Finally, a highly informal and insensitive update was given on former show personality Lady Di's struggles with homelessness and substance abuse.

Oh yeah  Jimmy, this is for you  Jimmy, this is for you  I love it  I'm digging it  Under the clean moon  For so many years  I've wondered who you are 
[00:01:30]  How could a person like you  Bring me down  Under the pale moon  Where I see a lot of stars  Is it not enough?  I saw the sign  And it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  Life is demanding  Without understanding  I saw the sign  And it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign

[00:03:30]  Finally getting to the tape  We've been looking for this  For a very long time  Years in the making  Alright, here it is  The first bit of audio  No, you don't just take the day off  To take the day off  We defend ourselves  No, it was him, wasn't it?  Some threats were made  We responded in kind this morning  Threats from the other guy, right?  Yeah  Oh, we should set this up  We should set this up, Anthony  We had Dice on the phone  And I guess we took a day off prior 
[00:04:00]  It wasn't our choice  Yeah  We got into another scuffle  With Howard Stern  Oops  And didn't listen to the bosses again  And we were told to take the day off  And think about it  Yeah  So now we're back on  On the program the next day  And Dice happened to call in that day  Of course you'll hear him kissing our ass  Through this whole phone call  Yeah  No, you don't just take the day off  To take the day off  We defend ourselves 
[00:04:30]  No, it was him, wasn't it?  Some threats were made  We responded in kind this morning  Threats from the other guy, right?  Yeah  See, that's not right  See, that's what I was talking about  The other day  Right  This is why I don't bother  With a guy like that  What does he care  If you guys are number one?  You tell me  You know what I mean?  What does that mean to his  See, I'm not sure  I'm the type of guy  When I see another guy  Wait a minute  Can I call my opener?  Yeah  Can I call my opener?  You never spoke to him  I heard he had a couple hookings 
[00:05:00]  Last night anyway  That's all he cares about  He doesn't even care about  Getting paid  He just wants girls to like him  Alright, give him a call  You know what his whole chant is?  Please let one girl like me  That's all he cares  That's Jim Norton  That's all he cares about  Is getting the mule out  And getting it emptied  I hear he's funny  Hold on a minute  I'll get him in one second  Hey, that is so weird  We have no clue  Who you are at this point  I said I hear he's funny  Yeah  I don't know anything about you  And he defined you perfectly 
[00:05:30]  Perfectly  How long ago?  This is  January  No, this is probably  This is 2000, right man?  It's about 2000  Six years ago?  Well, I was around for 9-11  I think I was a part of the show  By 9-11  Because I remember calling in  From Jersey that day  Yeah  That's always like the reference point  So I mean  About five years ago  But yeah, before that even  Wow  Okay  So Jim says hello  For the first time in this clip  Wow  Jim?  Yes  Yeah, you're on with  With Opie and Anthony 
[00:06:00]  Hey, what's up, man?  Yeah, I put your mule down a minute  How you guys doing?  Pretty good, Jim  Good, I can hardly hear you  What do you mean you can hardly hear him?  Don't act like you're not funny now  No, you can hear them  I can't hear  Don't disappoint me  You're on the air  Can you hear us now?  See, this is what I do  You see?  I bring my openers on  Yeah  Right?  And I don't even call him an opener  He's like my featured act  This guy's been with me for two years  I push his career  See, that's the thing  I like to see other people making it 
[00:06:30]  In my opinion  There's room for everybody  And I think that's the problem  In your case  That the other guy  Don't want to see nobody make it  Yeah  And that's wrong  That's accurate  I could agree with that  You know what I mean?  Sure  You know what I mean, Jim?  Don't I always push you?  You help me get laid  And that's what I like  You do push my career  But you do help me get laid  Tell him what you look like  I don't need to know  What he looks like  Tell him what a pity it is  To be you  I'm 5'7  Every time I see a wow sticker 
[00:07:00]  I lift my shirt  Yeah, you got man boobs  You got the man boobs  Yeah, I should be wearing a bra  With a pistol in my mouth  Oh, man  You got the man boobs  And Dice has the old man balls  No, he's very handsome  Wow, this is really weird  This is really weird  You don't know, Jimmy  I don't know you at all  He's all new  I don't know how to interact with him  And that was your first joke  On the show  Yeah  I'd have said  Oh, Jimmy  You're not like that  I would say  Good point, Ant  Good point  Be good to yourself 
[00:07:30]  First reference  The hooker  And I have fat tits  And should kill myself  Yeah  This call could have happened  Two days ago  I was going to say that  You beat me to it  I'm fucking  If you weren't shitting yourself today  You would have said that exact thing  I'm one trick chip  One of the people who hate me  It's been working the same joke for five years  It's fucking awful  If I actually got in shape  I would just come on there quiet  And nothing to say  If I didn't have to shit today  Do you realize  This is what I contributed  I fucked with diarrhea 
[00:08:00]  Yeah  Yeah, you contributed water out of your ass today  That is really funny  That was good, though  Very funny  And Dice taking stabs at Howard Stern  Yeah  Ah, but now they're buddies  Now they're buddies  Yeah  That makes sense  Dice sort of bull in the china shopping right there, too  Yeah  Not a lot of, you know  That's Norton's first appearance  But boy, that's  Oh, we got more tape here  Yeah  Here we go  More of Norton's first appearance  Sorry  More of Norton's first appearance  On the O.P. and Anthony program  Yeah, that's what he did 
[00:08:30]  Very handsome  Chiseled chin and blue eyes  Very good looking  You know, I had a fight on the radio the other day  With some woman  She got mad that I kept saying I was handsome  Yeah  Yeah  Do you know that, Norton?  No, I didn't hear her  What was it?  She caught in  I don't know  Some stupid housewife  Well, women are stupid anyway  They're annoying  Well, what do you mean they're annoying?  You love women  I like prostitutes  You like prostitutes?  I like prostitutes  I received oral treats from one last night  Forty dollars, forty-eighth and tenth  It was very nice  Yeah? 
[00:09:00]  Really?  Yeah  Was there any sniffing involved?  No, I don't sniff the backsides of prostitutes  That's degrading  But a regular girl, I'll sniff her backside  But not a prostitute  But what's the thrill in that?  I don't know  I don't know  It's just wrong  I mean, you never spoke to these guys  These guys don't know you  Yeah, we're  Yeah  I just like it  I don't know why  Because the look back they give you probably  The look back a woman gives you when you're back  They're just  You know, they're just  What are you doing?  No  Yeah, yeah  Just a little sniff sound  Do the sample  Do the sniff sound  I don't know if they can hear it  Yeah 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, we can hear it  It smells like a dog in heat  Oh, I like it though  Sometimes there's a little tinkle in there  It's nice  And the first tinkle reference  I'm just amazed  We got away with this on regular FM radio  That was New York only  That was before syndicate  Yeah  That was when we were flying  Under the radar  There was a time  We flew under the radar  Amazing  Now all eyes are on us  Oh, yeah  Look out  It's just so weird to hear  I know  Prostitutes  Tinkle  Sniffing of the ass  Jesus  Am I not grown? 
[00:10:00]  No  You like the prostitutes?  Love  Love  Yeah?  He's just a prostitute  He's heavy into the tinkle situation  Yeah  The golden shower  Yeah, he had two of them come over  And use him as their toilet  The night of the Roxy  Yeah, in L.A.  I was depressed  I couldn't meet a girl out to the show  So I called two escorts  And they wouldn't do anything  For like $300  They were just to show up  Yeah  So I wound up just, you know  Masturbating like a lab animal  With baby oil  While they just looked at me  You know  That's true 
[00:10:30]  That's what happened  They wouldn't do anything  For like  They wanted like $500 apiece  To have sex  So I just did that  And made them watch me  And then they left unhappy  Tell me he's not the perfect  Perfect opener for me  Yeah, I believe him  But he kills  Every show  He kills  That's Jim  Do that bit  Do that bit  What bit?  What bit?  Can you do any bits for him?  Yeah, do a bit  I'm not really prepared for bits  I didn't have anything written down  What do you mean written down?  You're supposed to be a comic  I told you  If I ever call you  And I'm on the air  To be prepared  How many times 
[00:11:00]  Did I tell you that, huh?  How many times  Does Club Soda Kenny  Tell you that?  Be prepared  I should follow his own advice  Let them talk  They run the show  Let them talk  Yeah, now you're a comic, right?  Yes  You work with Dice  Yes  You should be prepared  No, he is absolutely  The greatest stand-up  That's ever been in front of me  Oh, yeah  Absolutely, hands down  I just don't have  Disprepared, you know  I talk about hookers  That's what I talk about  And sometimes it turns people off  That's why I don't do a lot of radio  Because I want to talk about prostitutes  And they don't want to hear it  Wow 
[00:11:30]  I gave Dice a good one there  Yeah  Take your own advice  Be prepared when you call our show  And I reprimanded you, Jimmy, a little bit  And to my credit  You're a comic  You should have the material  And to my credit  I had no bit prepared for the radio  I didn't do bits even back then  No, you didn't  You sound nervous  And you're talking a lot faster  Oh, yeah, I was  You're getting every word in there  Dice was yelling at you  Dice is yelling at you  Dice doesn't yell at Jimmy anymore  No way  Jimmy's not going to say this  But Jimmy now sells a lot more tickets  Than Andrew Dice Clay 
[00:12:00]  Worse  I, uh, that's  Yeah, it's  You did a lot  Yeah  Why are you giving me the thumbs up?  I'm actually going to use it to plug my asshole  Alright, we're listening to the first time  Jim called our show  Let's listen to this  You got to see this guy when he gets out of the pool  Yeah  Why?  He gets in the pool  He gets excited just getting in the pool, this guy  Why, why is that? 
[00:12:30]  With white, white swim trunks  And I tear out the lining  Oh, Jesus  So your junk is prominently displayed  Yeah, nicely  Would you call it junk?  Yeah, we call it junk  You know, that's a great name for what's inside  I call it garbage  Because it's like  I was getting ready to  Pull my garbage all over this chick's back  Can I say that?  Uh, yeah  You just did  Alright, but it wasn't dumped or anything, right?  No, no  You can say dumped  Oh, hey, here's this  I'm ready to dump my garbage 
[00:13:00]  Yeah  On this chick's back  And she's looking at me going  Why do you want to do it on my back?  So I said  It's because your face don't appeal to me  Boo  You do that joke now, Anthony  Nah, that's okay  You did it good  Let me hear it  You did it good  Do it for me now  I'm not, I'm not  I'm not, I'm not  You did it good  Goodie good for you  You, you, you  Goodie good  I'm not going to go along with the bit  Because you didn't do it for me  I didn't want to do it because it was awful 
[00:13:30]  Let's just be honest here  It was an awful bit  Why do you wanna?  With the chick voice he used to do  And Jimmy  What's the matter, Jimmy?  Oh, nothing  Oh, boy  He's crossing his legs  Can't we at least get through one bit  Before you have to leave the studio?  And dude, we got an actor from the Poseidon  He's going to come in next  Can you please interview him from the back?  We'll make believe it's a phone call  It'll be worse than the tidal wave 
[00:14:00]  Alright  We'll make believe it's a phone call  Let's get my picture first  Alright, here we go  Just a couple more clips from Jimmy's first appearance on our show  Oh, okay  Alright  So what I'm saying is, you see  I take a guy like Norton  I put him out there  I try to let the world hear his name  So he doesn't always have to be the opener  So here's the point I'm making  That his career progresses  And he gets to where he wants to go  So I understand you had a problem  Because I'm on the air 
[00:14:30]  Talking about a carpet head  You know  And he threw like a fit  Like in a deli in New York  Something like that  Now why would he get mad at that?  I don't know  You know what I mean?  I don't know  But what I don't want you guys to do  Is fight  Because that's what he wants  That's his whole thing  Is to knock people on that down  Like I know  This guy has fallen through the cracks already  You know what I mean?  Nobody calls in 
[00:15:00]  Nobody wants to talk to him  You know what I mean?  He alienated everybody  But we shouldn't be like that  I'm not  We don't do that  We're not going to kick a guy when he's down  Okay?  Well some people  What a fucking asshole  Yikes  He's of course talking about Howard Stern in that clip  Yeah  And when we were down  He had no problem kicking us all over the place  Yeah  All over the place  What a fucking hypocrite  As a matter of fact 
[00:15:30]  You know what we should do, Jim?  Yes  I don't know  I'll leave this up to you  When we do the gig  I'm going to announce the gig  Next probably Wednesday  And I'll be in Anthony  Where we're going to be in New York  Okay  Maybe  I can't put him on after you  Maybe we let him do a few minutes before you  Maybe us  When we put him on  We stop building him up again  You know what I mean?  The other guy  You don't say his name  I don't know who you're talking about 
[00:16:00]  Yeah  He's got a nose like a condominium  And he's got a weaved head  Who is it?  Jeez  Spike in Chicago  What's up?  Yeah  I want to give Anthony credit for that joke  I don't think he got enough laughs  About the Poseidon Adventure title wave  Oh well  Nah  I didn't think it was that good  Kind of a throw away  I didn't even hear it  I liked it  I really didn't hear it  Yeah  I'll have to listen on the replay 
[00:16:30]  Yeah  Listen on the replay  It's fun that way  All right  I know  You listen to the replay  Jimmy  Jimmy you're right  Anything to add to this?  Yeah it's good to hear  Yeah he's really loving  Jimmy's really loving his first appearance  That's right  It's weird huh?  Yeah it's weird  What did we see in him?  I don't know  I don't know  Here's what happened  When I came back in the next time  When I came in for the first time  And I almost laughed  Shut up  Don't explain yourself  I have to  After this people are going to think  That I have photos  Of you guys blowing each other  For you to hire me  Why would this guy

[00:28:30]  He was a DJ  Spinning tunes  At a tiny station  On Long Island  Oh yeah  I was doing it with like  An 11 year old  Then one day  They came together  Break yourself  Got a bit  Life story  Go  We're pretty much broadcasting  Conversation from the locker room  Okay  There you go  I started filling up  The minute I got through the door  I don't wear bags  Indeed  It is a cock fest  Indeed  You're talking about the Opie and Anthony  They're the worst  And now  The best of the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  I got a call from Anthony around 
[00:29:00]  I don't know  I'm not your keeper by the way  I just like informing people  If I'm going to be a little tardy to the show  And you're the only number I have  It was very very nice actually  But anyway  I get a call from you around 5, 5, 10  I don't even know  That you're going to be late  Yeah  And then  There was an angry phone call  From a gas pump  In Queens  And it's 12 degrees out  It's not a morning to pump gas  I have things set up the way I like things 
[00:29:30]  It's not a morning to leave the house  I know  This would have been a great day to call in sick  You know  Living my life the way I do  And have in the past  And where I've gotten in life  Doing what I do  I've earned certain things  I believe  I worked hard for living for many years Opie  In the construction industry  You're scaring me  Because we've never worked hard in radio  No no no  This is the dream job 
[00:30:00]  We haven't earned crap  No no  I just mean life in general  That's why I didn't say in this career  We just happen to  Have a really good chemistry  That's  I don't know  And it's working  But we haven't worked hard at this  No  No  Not at all  I mean in life in general  Me  Myself  I have worked  I had a real job  You know  I was doing construction  I was in this type of cold  Frigid weather  Where a house is nothing but 2x4s  And you've got to put in duct work 
[00:30:30]  And it's freezing cold  And you don't want to be there  And you're humping stuff  And there's ice  It stinks  And I did that  But you know something  Throughout life  I have been afforded certain things  And now  I just don't have to deal with certain things  One of which is  Pumping gas in the freezing cold  I don't like doing it  So what I do is  I keep my car garaged  Make sure it's full of gas  And then when I leave  I don't even have to deal with the outside world 
[00:31:00]  Only the little walk  That I take to the studio  That's the only time you're outside all day?  Pretty much  Yeah because  Alright  So your car gets warmed up for you  Right?  While you're getting dressed  Well it's in the garage  But do you have one of those automatic  No  The garage is like heated  Alright  I got you  So it's  I get in  Look at you  Like I said  I have certain things  That I have now  That I never dreamt I would have  And that's one of them 
[00:31:30]  How do you get gas?  Like on the way home or something  It's not  You know  I don't need it balmy  I don't have to drive to the Caribbean  To fuel up  But you know  The sun on you is one thing  But when it's 4 in the morning  4.30 in the morning  And it's 5 degrees out  It's just cold  Are we looking at a garage diva here?  Garage diva  How warm do you keep your garage?  It's not like heated  Where there's a vent in there  But like the water heater  And stuff is in the garage  And it's well insulated  So it's warm enough  You know  It's like probably 
[00:32:00]  It's probably  I don't know  Almost 60 degrees in there  Which is fine  You know  And then you turn your heat on  Very nice  I enjoy the warmth  And uh  Well  Let's just say  I have some company over the house  There seems to be a family emergency  With my girlfriend  My girlfriend's family  And uh  Her sister  And husband are down  And staying at my place  And uh  They also have kids  There's uh  Two boys 
[00:32:30]  And a little  Infant type baby girl  Can I preface this?  Yes  For the new listeners  Yes  Anthony absolutely hates kids  I  No ands  Ifs  Or buts about it  Anthony  Cannot stand kids  You know what the extent of kids is  In my life  That I enjoy  If you see one  Being pushed in a carriage  Or something  And you go  Oh  Goo goo doo doo  And then walk away  I  I  I could appreciate  You actually do the  Goo goo goo goo goo  No I think it  Oh 
[00:33:00]  You know  Cause I don't think anyone actually  No  No one does that  Okay  It's  It's  Do you have a rattle in the back pocket  Where you just  Oh no  When you see kids  I  I try to make believe  They're not there  Is what I do  That's it  And  And  And  They're staying over  And  Well this morning  The  Their vehicle  Was in my  My driveway  Behind  My  My garage door  So I could not get my  Truck  My truck out  Like 
[00:33:30]  You know  I get in  It's warm  So I had to take my  My girlfriend's vehicle  Which is out in the driveway  In  In the freezing cold  By the way  There's a trucker  Checking in from Minnesota  Yeah  Pretty much saying  Stop bitching about  12 degrees in New York  It's a negative 48 in Minnesota  That's why I don't live in that  Frozen tundra  Ugh  Minnesota  No  12 is cold enough  It's plenty cold  After 12  Yeah  12  48  Does it matter  Does it really matter  So I get 
[00:34:00]  I get  I get in the girlfriend's vehicle  And  I have no idea how anything works in it  And  It's pitch black  And  And I can't even  I can't figure anything out  And I'm trying to drive now  It's freezing cold in there  Before it heats up  And  I can't figure out the radio  So  Like  Gwen Stefani  Is just blasting  And I can't change the  And I mean blasting  And it's early in the morning  And now I can't even  I can't shut it off  I can't change the station  Because now I'm really late  And  I'm driving 
[00:34:30]  It's  I am freaking out  I can't adjust the mirrors  I don't even know how to adjust the mirrors  So I can't see anything behind me  I'm driving  Freezing cold  Loud  Gwen Stefani  Now  I'm on the expressway  You honestly  Couldn't figure out where the volume controls are?  I couldn't figure out  It's like  It's like the glass cockpit  Of a brand new fighter jet  There's no knobs  There's no nothing  It's all touch screen  Glass screen  Really?  Oh yeah  This thing is like  The future 
[00:35:00]  I'm surprised it doesn't fly  Oh  Sorry  Not loud enough  It was blasting  And I couldn't turn it down  And there I am  Hey  Here I am  Driving down the expressway  How do I turn this down?  How do I turn it down?  Oh my god  I'm freezing  Oh stop  I can't take it  I'm freezing cold  One thing I did hear though 
[00:35:30]  One thing I did hear though  Who really cares  Cause if you love you  Never know it  Low fuel  Low fuel  Low fuel  What?  What?  What?  My mule?  What are you saying vehicle?  I don't understand you  Low fuel  Low fuel  I wish I could listen to 
[00:36:00]  1010 wins  So I know what's going on  For the show  But I gotta hear  Gwen Stefani  On 11  Shut up  Shut up  Shut up  This is my drive in  Oh it's only  It's only  Quarter to five  In the morning  I like listening to  Loud dance music  At quarter to five  In the morning  Stop  Please stop  Yeah 
[00:36:30]  And then  Now  Now I have to  Stop for gas  Which is my  Nightmare  Early in the morning  When it's  12 degrees out  So  So I  Pull into the gas station  And of course  It sounds minor  But when  You ever been so  Livid  That anything new  Thrown into the situation  Will just  Freak you out  Oh yeah  Definitely  I pull in  And of course  The gas cap's  On the opposite  Side of my vehicle 
[00:37:00]  So now I gotta  Get back in  And I've already  Slid the credit card  Through  So now I gotta  I can't just go  To the other side  I gotta kind of  U-turn around  And uh  I go to open up  The gas cap  And I have no idea  How to open up  The gas thing  And I am now  And I'm just  Tick tock  Tick tock  Time is ticking away  This is show prep time  I'm picturing everyone  Sitting here  Ben herking  At his computer  Hope he's going  Through the papers  Uh  Norton's still sleeping  Cause he's not in 
[00:37:30]  Until six  So  My girlfriend  Gets this call  From my cell phone  She  She picks up the phone  Where the fuck's  The gas cap  Release  The thing  Shit  Oh  Baby I don't know  I've never  Fueled it up  Ah  I'll find it  Damn it  Click  That was  My call to her 
[00:38:00]  At about  Five  This morning  And you know  What really  Ticked me off  There is no thing  You just do it  With your hand  Are you serious  You just pull the flap  Up with your hand  But every new vehicle  And mine  Has a little thing  Inside  They went back  To old school  They went old school  On me  And it threw me  For a loop  So now I  I think  The only saving grace  Is it was a self  Serve pump  With a little thing  That keeps the  The gas flowing  So you should  Jump back in the car 
[00:38:30]  No I could just  Put my hands  In my pocket  While I called  Opie  Oh it's me  I'm putting gas  In my car  In Queens  Really  You thought  You'd announce  That to me  I was like  What  Why are you  Yelling at me  I'm like  Whatever dude  Alright  We'll be here  I'm nice and warm  It's about 80 degrees  In our office  We'll try not  To start the show  Without you  Yeah  And I'm just  A livid idiot  Oh  So I was  And I got no sleep  Really last night  Because I got to bed 
[00:39:00]  Very late  Kids around the house  And there's  There's a toddler  Around there  Which just has me  Like freaking out  Because my house  I pretty much have  Yeah keep them away  From the rotating  Saw blades  That I have  Because I  The image of a child  In this place  Just never crossed my mind  You were telling me  In the office  Three kids running around  Yeah  Two little ones  And an infant  That's just starting to walk  Two boys that are  I guess like  Six, seven, eight-ish  Around there  This is your hell  This is your hell on earth  And a girl 
[00:39:30]  Who's like  I guess  One maybe  Just like  Just starting to walk  Running around  My glass coffee table  With sharp corners on it  And then yesterday  I'm on the computer  And  Yeah  And the parents  Go  Oh come here  Come here  The kid  Is holding a pair  Of scissors  The little one-year-old  Girl has scissors  That I just leave  Laying around  To open up like  Boxes and stuff  Because  It's not childproof 
[00:40:00]  Here's the kid  No  Scissors  And where was  Randy Quaid  While all this  Was going on  No  Are you saying  It's like vacation  Was he in the kitchen  With his dickie  And his little moose cup  Having some eggnog  They do live upstate  Though  Took a long trip  Down here  You want to put an end  To that problem  You ought to hire  A fat clown  From Chicago  To come over  And entertain  Oh my god 
[00:40:30]  And  Yeah  So the girl  Runs around  And just finds  Every single  Dangerous thing  In my apartment  Which there are  Plenty of  You know  There's two adults  Living there  It's very  Hard to  You don't baby proof  Things  You know  I got like  Bleach and brandy  Snifters  Laying on the floor  For some reason  You know  And I didn't even  Realize it  But there it is  I didn't even  Know that was there  Until the baby  Goes to take a swig  And the boys  Just like to  For some reason  Boys 
[00:41:00]  At the drop of a hat  Just want to run around  And go  All right  We get it  No no  Let me do it  Another half hour  Then you might  Start understanding it  Maybe  But probably not  Maybe an hour 
[00:41:30]  Two hours  I just sit  On my computer  And  And just  Then the girl  Finds this thing  That's been  Stuck to my  Refrigerator  For five years  Probably  A little  Happy birthday cake  I had no idea  What it ever did  Didn't think  It did anything  Just held  Postcards  On there  That's all  It ever did  For five years  You know  What it does  When you press  The button  Happy birthday  To you  That's nice 
[00:42:00]  That's all it does  That's nice  You know  What happens  When you press  The button  Ten thousand times  Happy birthday  To you  Happy birthday  To you  Happy birthday  To you  Happy birthday  To you  Happy birthday  To you  I  I  I've always made it clear  I don't want children  You hate kids  I  Never  Want children 
[00:42:30]  Don't you have stuff  That they can play with  This is such a cool  Remind  Yeah scissors  Whatever they want to grab  From an open box  Or something  I  I'm petrified  When they run around  The house  Because like I said  I don't care  I have just  For no reason at all  I guess about  Three weeks ago  I took a frayed wire  And just plugged it  In the wall  And left the two ends  Just hanging there  Because I like it  Apparently I've forgotten  About it  You know  Kids come over  And grab it  I don't know 
[00:43:00]  What I have in my house  It's just dangerous  I know it's dangerous  You're bringing back  Your memory  Because my sister  Will drop her  Her kid off  In my house  Every once in a while  Like hey  I got a couple errands  Do you mind  Watching JD  I'm like yeah  No problem  You know  And then  After me and the kids  Stare at each other  And I love the kid  We stare at each other  Stare at each other  For about ten minutes  Like  And  Alright what do you want to do  And he's like  You got anything to play with here  I'm like  Didn't mommy  Give you some toys  To play with 
[00:43:30]  While she does her errands  No  And we're sitting on the couch  And I mean  You can only have a  Five minute conversation  With a five six year old  Right  I'm like  Well you like video games  Yeah  Alright try this  And this is an old story  But I threw in  Grand Theft Auto  For him  Oh my god  So then you fast forward  An hour  Because now I'm doing my thing  Because it's kind of like  You know  You let the TV  Babysit the kid  I learned  A long time ago  Yes  Whether you throw a cartoon on  Or Grand Theft Auto  It works  They're quiet  They're sitting in front of the TV 
[00:44:00]  Enjoying themselves  And you can go do  Whatever you have to do  That's pretty much  What I wound up doing  So you fast forward  A half hour  40 minutes  And my sister comes in  The house  And is like  Greg  What the fuck  Are you doing  And I'm like  What  I come running  In the living room  And there's JD  He figures out  How to use the guns  And how to pick up  Prostitutes  Oh really  Oh yeah  Playing the game  Well because I figured  I gave him the basics  Like you know  You jump in this car here  And drive it around  Drive around the city  A little bit  It's cool right  And that's  And I'm thinking  A five six year old  He's never going to get  Past that stage 
[00:44:30]  I come in  And he's just  Blowing people away  Figuring it out  He's picking up  The prostitutes  He's figuring out  The whole game  Oh man  And I didn't know this  And my sister  Just walks into my house  You know  And that's what she sees  And she just starts  Cursing me out  I'm like  What  What are you doing  Like next time  Maybe you know  Leave toys with him  I don't know  Yeah you just wind up  Throwing videos in  You know  We have some videos  Laying around  That they can watch  You know  Here watch  Full Metal Jacket  Kid  What the hell

[00:45:30]  I love throat pudding  Whatever it is  Yeah  Throat yogurt  Throat yogurt  I don't know  I'm sure there's a throat pudding also  Yeah but it was terribly directed  A message to Yoshi  We love you  But enough with the porno  That's for Opie  Wow  People love the porno  I have a stack of porno  That he gave us  I'm only through the first one  For Norton  Continue sending  Of course  And for Anthony  Alright  Might have more kids dropping by  Yeah  Well that's quite funny Anthony  Oh  It's just been 
[00:46:00]  You know  One of those  I didn't get to sleep last night  I think about  I think about  2.30 this morning  I heard  You know  Oh man  From like the room  The guest room  Dude I didn't  Am I hearing that?  I didn't get to sleep  Because  And actually  I'm going to throw myself  Under a bus again today  But  Ben witnessed this  First hand 
[00:46:30]  I discovered  Solitaire  On my trio  And  You just  Got  A new  Top of the line  Computer  Oh I know  And you play  Solitaire  On your trio  That's the problem  These simple games  Are the ones  That are the problems  Like the Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  I got it  Yeah  Love it  But I discovered  Solitaire  On my trio  I didn't go to bed  Until I beat the game  And it took hours  You get obsessed  With these games  I got OCD 
[00:47:00]  When it comes to video games  I can't  Put  The game down  I was in the middle  Of the Jets game  This weekend  Ben came over  With a few people  And  And I'm sitting  On the couch  Playing game  After game  After game  On this trio  And I get mesmerized  And I cannot  Put the game  Down  Yeah you're crazy  And I get it in my head  I can't  I can't stop playing  Until I beat  The game  And it's stupid  Solitaire  You can't just shut it off  Can't shut it off  Watch the football game  So around 1130 
[00:47:30]  Last night  I'm usually in bed  By 9  Yeah  I finally beat the game  And I can go to bed  For my 5 hours  Because then you know  You're up at 4  And so  It's a horrendous  Obsession I have  With these stupid  Simple games  I need the full blown  Graphics  Oh yeah  I love that too  But for some reason  That's why I'm tired today  You're a lonely man  The stupidest thing  That's sad  I'm on a trio with this  No I don't  Do you use your little  Stylus  Yeah I do  Beep  Beep  Over and over 
[00:48:00]  And over again  Like something just  Keeps clicking in my brain  And I can't turn it off  Do you chew on your stylus  No no  I don't do any of that  Big gnarly  Chewed up stylus  Why don't you just  Get some real cards  Oh there you go  No that's  That's too much work  Too much work  It's more fun though  You need a surface  Dude  With the trio solitaire  You don't even have to  Put the cards on the aces  They do it for you  Does it all by itself  Yeah  The worst is when you  Play solitaire on the bed  And you kneel  And all the cards  Kind of come in 
[00:48:30]  Towards your leg  Into your knee  Yeah  You mess up all the piles  You actually play  The real solitaire  It's the only way  A man does it  Does anyone play  Real solitaire anymore  No  Never  You play chess  On the computer  Yeah I'd rather  Play with a person  Because the computer  Is just for me  Unbeatable  Pretty rough  You can go online though  And play with other people  That's too creepy  Yeah that's creepy  Online  If I'm on a computer  Would you come over  And take a leak on me  Absolutely  That's not creepy  I stopped playing 
[00:49:00]  Chess online  I told this story too  I got into chess again  And I started playing online  You know  Because I don't have  Anyone around  To really play  Yeah  So I'm in like  Kind of a  I don't know  I don't know  Chess chat room  Kind of playing  Yeah but I'm trying  To think  Not like beginner  Kind of  I don't know  Novice  Intermediate  Somewhere in the  Chicken hog  Kind of intermediate  I guess you know  And I'm beating  These people  Left and right  And I'm like  Just  I'm thinking  I'm like  A chess champion 
[00:49:30]  Again you know  Because I used to  Take it a little  Kind of serious  When I was  When I was a lot  Younger  And then you know  That stupid chat feature  Hey you're pretty good  Because I was playing  The same person  Over and over again  But in general  Winning a lot of games  And this guy goes  Hey you're pretty good  Pretty good  How old are you  And I'm like  Well how old are you  I'm eight  Eight  I'm like that's it  I'm effing done  Eight  Because it wasn't like  I was totally  Killing the kid  I was you know  I was winning 
[00:50:00]  But you know  It took a little  Some effort  I'm like I'm playing  Eight year olds online  I'll meet you  Yeah  7-11  My treat  So now I can't  Admit my real age  Because it would be  Way creepy  So I'm like  I'm 15  If you're ever  Putting I'm 15  Into a computer  Oh I know  Turn yourself in  So I was just  It just got too creepy  And that was the end  Of my online chess  I'm like it's all  Little kids  Just learning how to play  Did you drive over  To his house 
[00:50:30]  And give him a t-shirt  Yeah  Keep the cop  So I don't do that anymore  Jim from the Poconos  Go ahead  Good morning gentlemen  Anthony you got to do  What I do  When it's time for bed  Hey Uncle Anthony  You got to go to bed  Everybody go to bed  I got to be the killjoy  Time to go to bed  And Opie you either need  To get a girlfriend  Or a hooker  Because something's  Going on with you  I have a question for Anthony  Why didn't you  Like this morning 
[00:51:00]  Why didn't you just  Get these people out of bed  And say  Get the keys  And say  Move your truck  I got to go  You know why  It just would have  Taken too long  I know I was going  To be late  I didn't want to be  Ridiculously late  And I can't  You know  I can't depend  That someone's  Going to jump out of bed  Just grab whatever's around  And then get in the truck  And back it out  Of the driveway  Oh I thought he was  Just too busy  Empty in the septic tank  No it's not  It's not a motor home  Oh alright  I'm still convinced

[00:56:30]  The others had to be hand carried by multiple people  Disaster preparedness planners say  Protecting hospitals is one of their major concerns  The injured could die  If there are no functioning emergency rooms  We're going to have tens of thousands of injured people  Maybe hundreds of thousands of injured people  We need the hospitals  They want new hospitals to be constructed  Like fortresses  And existing facilities to be upgraded  Just in case  To learn more watch Explorer  Presented by DLP Technology  From Texas Instruments  Wednesday nights

[01:18:30]  Seems like a good idea when you're young  But aren't you worried about getting older  And all of a sudden  The asshole falls out  Yeah exactly  Actually I believe  I believe that if you use your muscles  And your body  Like your anal muscles  And your vaginal muscles  And they get stronger  Oh so it'll be stronger  And like  That's one of those  If you don't use those muscles  No research behind it  And you just have a hole that people fall into  See I have like  Like a lot of muscles in my pussy  Like when I push  Yeah  Like they actually come  Like they'll come out  Oh yeah  That being said  I would recommend that  86 year olds out there  Go and start gaping 
[01:19:00]  Yeah but they can squirt  What do they have to lose though  At that point  Might as well  Pick up a new hobby  At 86  Hey they say  A butt plug a day  For a butt plug for an hour a day  Takes the stress away  For men and women  Oh really  Mmhmm  I know you watch television  No I think a butt plug a day  For what an hour a day  An hour a day  Takes the stress away  I think that's 23 hours of stress  Thinking about getting a butt plug  Have you tried it?  No  I think I'm going to stick with the stress  Yeah 
[01:19:30]  You can get the small one  I'm going to stick with the high blood pressure  They have ones that go by sizes  Oh yeah different sizes  That's how you can get the small one  And then you can work your way up  You're just not willing to change  Yeah you're right  I have a huge butt plug  Do they have one called  The Lil Butt Plug  Spelled like that  L-I-L  Is it a comma?  Well if they don't  Then I'm going to have to come up with one  Also known as  Daddy's Disappointment  They can have like a thumb  Do like a thumb one  Yes is the answer  A thumb?  No  No  No thumb  You don't even like a little tongue 
[01:20:00]  You don't like your salad tossed  With a BJ?  No  You don't shave your butthole do you?  It's hairy  The only thing  No no no  It's not  The only thing I like down there  Is a Charmin  And then a little aloe wipe  Right afterwards  I like the bidets  And that  Yeah well  Not everybody has one  I like to turn them on full blast  And have them go right up my ass  You like fight the bidet stream  You could have a battle with it  And see you could  You could probably  Like squirting and keeping it down  Exactly  Like two wizards going at it 
[01:20:30]  I have a friend who has a shower attachment  That's a dildo  And you put it on your shower head  And you just stick it up your ass  And it goes  That must be like great when company comes over  You got a hybrid dildo shower head  Yeah who's mopping up over there  Who's on the  Oh well of course  Bill the intern  Hey how much better was today  As opposed to yesterday  A lot better  Yeah a lot better  Would you have taken the blast in the face  Bill the intern  Um  Potentially  Potentially  Yeah  You'll smell a homeless girl's ass 
[01:21:00]  But you won't take  Once you try you'll love it  I would much rather do that  Than smell that awful person's ass again  Yeah  You had a homeless woman in here yesterday  She got naked  And pulled her butt cheeks apart  And he got his nose an inch from it  And inhaled deeply  And almost  Oh goodness  Almost dropped dead  Hope she froze to death overnight  I don't know  I pay you off for that  Yeah he's a trupper  That wasn't a joke  No  He really meant that  He really means that  This just in  Jimmy Norton has jumped from the Hollywood sign  None of you guys have been with a girl that squirts when you have sex with her 
[01:21:30]  No  No  Oh my god you guys are missing out  Yeah I guess we are  What's wrong with these women  I think that would be a surprise that would be a little odd  Like I can't  You warn people beforehand  Yeah do you do you  That's a good question  Well I mean everybody pretty much knows  I guess  But like in  I don't  I don't know  I mean most civilians  It's like your bed  Most civilians  Is your bed just a mess  They're into it  Like most people are really into it  Or the guy's bed  Doesn't that become a mess or  It gets wet but it dries very fast 
[01:22:00]  Yeah but then it's  You know  And it's odorless  It's just the first time  It's odorless  I mean when you come on your bed  Do you like freak out  And like go wash it like right away  You probably have a billion comb stains on your bed  I tell you  If I came a gallon on my bed  I would probably be concerned  If I came as much as you just did  I have guys that they want me to  Because then they want to sleep in it later  And they want to smell my juices  Wow  Alright  I could always go off the edge of the bed  And just come on  You know off the side 
[01:22:30]  A lamp on the carpet  Or I could hit your curtains  Like a lamp or some knick-knack curtains  Maybe you went to Cape Cod  And you got a little lobster magic  I have in fact  I did a competition  Where I got to squirt on flowers  And then when it got wet enough  They popped up  Oh  Yeah  And then we did one where we made  Electricity run  For some reason I don't believe that  With what?  With the water  That goes through the machine  And then they have you squirt on it  Oh like a water wheel?  Yeah they have you squirt on it  And then it goes around  And then it turns the light bulb on  Even the water wheel  Is being used for pornography  These days  Isn't that amazing? 
[01:23:00]  I love it  Well that's something  You ever hit a radiator  And  Actually I  I was doing  A movie  It's called Pussy Party  For Cousin Stevie  Pussy Party  Yeah  Number 6 I believe  And the girls were using  A magic wand on me  And I was in doggy  And I squirted all over it  And I got electrocuted  Wow you felt a shock  I got  I got electrocuted like twice  I had to pull it out of the wall  Wow  That's terrific  Hey you know  Nothing like feeling alive  Yeah  Well you are something else  I love sex

Eximination Awards  Eximination Awards  The Eximination Awards  Where all of XM  Will be New Year's Day  And now a minute  With the New York Times  Here's sports writer Jason Stallman  In 2006 the sports world  Coped with many of the same old issues  Doping, athletes misbehaving  On and off the field  Diminishing TV ratings  But perhaps the most peculiar issue  To repeatedly rear its head in sports  Was the balls  This summer Adidas introduced  A new soccer ball for the World Cup 
[01:28:30]  Strikers liked the new ball  But goalies were much less enthusiastic  It was rounder  It swerved more  Sometimes like a knuckleball in baseball  The NBA introduced a new composite basketball  This season  Players hated it  And David Stern, the NBA commissioner  Had to acknowledge the league's mistake  He ultimately agreed to go back  To the leather ball  Starting January 1st  The National Football League  Also changed how it handles  The official game balls  Before this season  Visiting teams offense  Had to play with the balls  That were broken in  By the home quarterback  Now visiting quarterbacks  Are allowed to break in 
[01:29:00]  A dozen balls for each game  The NFL's new policy  Has not created any controversy  At least not yet anyway  With the playoffs  Just around the corner  You might want to keep  Your eye on the balls  I'm Jason Stallman  For the New York Times  The virus is an XL channel  Which may contain explicit language  Channel blocking is available  By calling 1-800-XM-RADIO  Or in XM-Canada  877-438-9676  Opie and Anthony  Yeah  Oh  Yeah  It doesn't get any worse than this  Wrong-O 
[01:29:30]  And now  The best of the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Danny  This is exactly why  I actually had to stay up  To watch you on Letterman  Because I can't make phones  Or TiVos  Or fry a friggin' egg  If I could do any of these things  I'd be single  You're on a better phone though  You sound better  Good  I'm down in my kitchen  Congratulations for  Was it the top moment  In reality show history  Which one?  I was watching on  What was it?  VH1 over the weekend 
[01:30:00]  And they were doing  They were counting down  You know  They have to count down  Everything nowadays  But they were doing like  What was it?  Reality  Cringe reality moments  Or something like that  And I believe you were number one  Oh nice  You know what?  You know what?  I'm probably number one  Through seven  Would be my guess  When you dramatically took the  Was it vodka  Into the cranberry?  Yeah  And just dramatically  Let the vodka bottle  Empty into the cranberry bottle  And then chugged it  That was terrific  I'd say when I cram the steroids  Into my ass 
[01:30:30]  It's the cramming the vodka  In the bottles moment  If I had to pick  And then getting on your longboard  And just like  Just you know  Flowing into traffic  With not a care in the world  Well you know what?  I really didn't think  This is so odd  When I lived in New York City  I used to drive by motorcycle  And almost always drunk  And my wife said to me  You know that's probably  Not in your best interest  And I told her  Stone sober  And with a straight face 
[01:31:00]  No the traffic in this town  Is so fast  People are really only  Going fast enough  To knock me down  Probably not kill me  And that was my theory  About running that red light  On the skateboard  I figured  You know it's probably  Going to hurt  But I'll survive it  Yeah and you did  That show  Is the show coming back?  Yeah it'll be back in October  I agreed to do  A second season  Of Breaking Badaluchi  Just to apologize  For the first season  Yeah but you gotta  If anybody can relate to this 
[01:31:30]  I think it is you guys  Right  I mean because I was  Watching you last night  On Letterman  You did a great job  By the way  I was very  I mean I don't really know you  But I was very proud of you  Thank you Danny  But I was shocked  And dismayed  That I had been fired  From my radio station  At the end of that  Television show  Right  I had been telling stories  About my life  Every day on the radio  For 16 years  I told a million stories  Like that  And I think what happened  Is when my boss  Actually saw one 
[01:32:00]  He said  I can't have this guy  In my employ  So I think  That was  That was a big shocker  For me  Was that people  Took it quite so seriously  So season two  I did in an attempt  To make up for season one  So I look much more employable  So you're gonna be softer  No I suck dude  I'm such an ass  Are you gonna like  Be romantic Danny  I'm the same jerk dude  I'm drunk and mean  Oh you're still drinking  That first season 
[01:32:30]  Made me want to do roids  He was ripped  You were ripped bro  Okay I gotta tell you  Out of everything  I've ever done  Cause like  I've made the worst  Decision ever  When drunk  I mean just  I've done  Just ridiculous stuff  And I've crashed my bikes  And I've gotten in fights  I couldn't possibly win  And slept with women  That had mustaches  I mean I just  Made bad calls  On alcohol  But roids  Dude I just looked  Bitchin  I'm telling you 
[01:33:00]  He looked like  He could have done  The next Rambo  When he sticks it  In his shoulder  I was like  Good lord  How old are you Danny  I'm 47  I mean  That made me want  To do roids  I'm like this guy  Is shredded at 47  It was a great commercial  For roids  It really was  And it's funny  Because the anger  Everybody said  Oh this guy  Went into roid rage  I had been doing roids  Behind my wife's back  For quite a while  And she never noticed  Because I was  In fact I was just  Kidding around  I had been sober  For quite a while  And she never noticed  And then I started 
[01:33:30]  Drinking again  And turned back  Into this combative  Jerk  And everybody who  Didn't know me  Blamed the roids  I gotta tell you  I mean I can't  Go ahead around  And in all good conscience  Condone the use  Of an illegal drug  But if you get  Your hands  And this is the  Cool thing  Because it takes  An extra step  Of balls  To really use them  Because when I  First used steroids  Don't have any  Experience  And a guy  Hands me  A huge needle  Because steroids  Are in a very  Thick oil  And you need  It's almost like 
[01:34:00]  An ice pick  You have to ram  Into your bottle  So aside from that  He gives me the bottle  And on the bottle  Is a picture  Of a horse  And it says  Veterinario  I'm actually  Shooting oil  Made for Mexican  Horses  With an ice pick  Into my ass  Hey how many  Home runs  Do you think  You could have  Hit a year  Oh see  That is the  Only drawback  Is I am now  Banned from  Major League Baseball 
[01:34:30]  I really love them  There goes  Your career  In baseball  Hey we were  Telling the story  The other day  And we want to  Know if it's true  If it's false  If some of the  Facts are true  I don't think  He'll ever say  The name  But  Oh really  You know  A man  Dick  Yes  Yeah  There's a  There's a story  About maybe  A fight that  Happened  I will tell you  Okay  It makes us laugh  Man  We've heard this  Story a few times  Over the years  This should make  This should make you  This should make you 
[01:35:00]  Want to fly out to  LA and kiss me  Right on the mouth  I know every other  Jock in the world  Does  And it's  Just your  I've really never  Told the story  In detail  Because they were  Legal problems  But let's  Allege that  There was  A jock called  Boy Bovine  Or something like that  Right  Bovine  Whatever the case  May be  Yeah  This guy  Was hassling me  On the radio  And worked  Two doors down  He literally  Worked  Not only in the  Same building  On the same  Hallway  So I marched 
[01:35:30]  Into his show  One day  And said  Dude  I will drag you  Out of here  And beat you  To death  Don't do it again  So he stopped  Immediately  But then he went  After my friends  And I figured  They're grown men  They can defend  Themselves  Which they failed  To and that  Kind of bothered me  But one day  He said something  About a particular  Friend of mine  Who had  A child  With a particular  Difficulty  And I said  I've had all  I'm going to  Take of this guy  And I told him  Flat out  I said  The next time  I see you  Because at that point  He started  Holding  Having bodyguards 
[01:36:00]  At the front of his door  Because he knew  I wasn't playing with him  So one day  I'm waiting for the elevator  It opens  I walk in  And there he is  And I push the button  The door closes  And you know how  There's that quiet moment  Where nobody knows  What to say  Yeah  I don't have those  I don't have those  I just looked at him  Immediately  And I went  Wow  Today's your day  Matt  And I guess  I had all the time  In the world  To think  I went  Are you just  Scared to death 
[01:36:30]  Or do you think  There's a way out  Of this  You've just  Fucking with him  There was a girl  With him by the way  Oh classic  And so  He steps out  Into the parking structure  Into an underground  Parking lot  I mean  If I was a soprano  I'd have shot him  Perfect spot man  So I mean  We're not  We're barely out of the door  And I turn around  And I expect  Because by the way  I'm five foot six  And aside from that  One moment on steroids  I'm a three pack a day smoker 
[01:37:00]  I've been  An active drunk  For a decade  At this point  The only thing  That makes me  A real live threat  Is that I don't know  That I'm not  Six foot five  And tough  I fail to notice  That I'm a short  Wheezing chain smoker  So I turn to the guy  To actually fight  And he puts this girl  Up to his chest  And literally  Not figuratively  Literally  Hides behind her  And I said  Are you  Are you kidding me  You're gonna  You're gonna hide  Behind this girl  And he said something 
[01:37:30]  And I said  Do you have no honor  And dig this  This will tell you  Everything you need  To know about this guy  He looked at me  And he said  Honor  What year do you  Think this is  As if  Honor comes with  Some sort of  Expiration date  Yeah  Of course  Had he asked me  I'd have had the  He'd say  No of course  I don't have any honor  Look at me  I'm a drunk  This jockey  But he said  You know  What year is it  So I went after  The girl  I said something  Really terrible  About the girl  And I even apologized  To her  Right afterwards  I said 
[01:38:00]  A terrible thing  About his girlfriend  And I said  I'm sorry  And I stepped back  Just assuming  Any man  Would now  Have to step up  To the plate  Right  And he didn't  And I said  Are you gonna  Let me talk  To her  Like that  Again  And he said  I don't care  If you talk  All day  And he said  Something I didn't like  And I realized  He's a full head  And shoulders  Taller than the girl  So I just  Jumped in the air  And tagged him  In the head  As hard as I could  And dropped him  Right behind his girlfriend  And she's just  Standing there 
[01:38:30]  Over his lifeless body  And I got back  In the elevator  And I left  And my staff  Went down  And let's say  That he went by  The name Bull  On the radio  Shall we  My staff  Actually went down  To the parking lot  And drew a chalk outline  Of a cow  For all the world  To see  And then  It gets better  To think this  So he goes  On the radio  And talks about  How I attacked him  When he was looking  And he's gonna sue me  And that I sucker  Punched him 
[01:39:00]  And this  And all that  And I tell him  Buddy  I want you to sue me  I need you to sue me  You know why  Because there's  Security cameras  Everywhere  And all they're  Gonna show on the news  Every single night  Is you standing  Behind a woman  As a guy  Half your size  Kicks your ass  So he backed down  And the cool part is  There were no security cameras  I just made it up  On the spot  And he went for it  But that is my  That is my 
[01:39:30]  Favorite  Yeah  Very good  This jocky story  That's awesome  I've really met  Probably in my  16 years on the air  I've met maybe  Three jocks  That didn't deserve death  You know what I mean  We're not a great  Breed of people  No  A lot of assholes  This guy really  Had it coming  I felt  I hope we're in  Your friend category  So far  Alright so far  Yeah so far  No things are going  Things are going  Really nicely  Plus  I am  You know I haven't  Had a chance  To hear too much  Of you  I've either been 
[01:40:00]  On at the same time  I don't  Currently get XM  I will certainly  Listen to you  In the future  But I've heard  None of the great  Things about you  And you killed  I really thought  You killed  On Letterman  Thanks man  So what's up  I felt  Because people in TV  Don't get  Like you know  People I was at the Emmys  The other night  And people that I knew  Hated each other  Were standing right next  To each other  Being friendly  Right  And I thought  David brought up  A person that you  Actively hated  Went out of your weight 
[01:40:30]  And very ballsy  To admit you hate that guy  And Letterman  Couldn't get that  Like people in TV  Say I hate you  And then you know  Have cocktails together  Where you know  There are disc jockeys  I would sit on fire  And make a hole  On their chest  That's how people  In radio hate  It is a personal hatred  Man  And I thought  You guys really  Pulled that up nicely  Yeah because Letterman  Was trying to get serious  With that whole thing  And Anthony  Completely diffused  The situation  When he went into  His Howard impression 
[01:41:00]  By the way  Never heard that before  Brilliant man  Thanks man  Absolutely brilliant  So Danny  Enough about us  What's up with this game show  It's called Starface  Oh you're very kind  Yeah it's called Starface  It's on every  Like Tuesday through  Saturday night  On the game show network  9.30 Tuesday through  Saturday  And basically  It's  It's  Oh the National Enquirer  Meets Jeopardy  If you know  Who's sleeping with who  Who's in rehab  Who's taking drugs  And who's getting a divorce  You can win at Starface 
[01:41:30]  Oh cool  Like pop culture  We're building a whole category  To Mel Gibson  At this very moment  I went in  You'll think that  I went into the  Audition  Because like  After breaking  Bonaduce  And like I said  I was surprised  After breaking  Bonaduce  There was not  This mad dash  To hire me  That I thought  There would be  Because I told my wife  I said  She said  Danny  I don't  I don't think  You should do this  I don't think  You're ever going  To work again  And I said  Honey  I'm a disc jockey  I work in Babylon  I am surrounded by  I am surrounded by 
[01:42:00]  Whores and I am  Their king  This is perfect  Don't worry  Everything's going  To be great  And sure enough  Everybody was terrified  To give me this job  So I went down  To give me any job  So I went down  To audition  Just like any other audition  There was 150 other  Game show host type guys  And you know  I don't remind a lot of people  Of Chuck Worry  You know what I'm saying  Come off as a game show guy  But they had this segment  Called mug shots  And what it is  We show a mug shot  Of a celebrity  And then ask questions 
[01:42:30]  About that  And I would like  To personally thank  From the bottom of my heart  Nick Nolte  For making that category  What it is today  Oh yeah  But I turned to  The producer  And I said  Listen if we ever  Run out of mug shots  We can use mine  And with me  You get to pick an era  And I think  That's a cinch  And sure enough  By episode 5  We were using  My mug shots  And using me  As a category  So that's gotten  To be really fun  We'll definitely  Take a look at that  That's for sure 
[01:43:00]  Good  I'd appreciate  I'm keeping  You know  I'm keeping busy  As I can  You know  Waiting for  Several morning shows  To die  So I can take their job  But in the meantime  I'm a game show host  Are they calling you  In New York  Or what  Well I got an offer  I got an offer  In New York  Almost immediately  And I was very  Grateful for it  But I promised  My daughter  And you know  I'm a really good  Husband and father  When my wife  Is really threatening  To take half my money  And she's just not kidding 
[01:43:30]  And we had made  This promise  A while ago  That I would know  I wouldn't move  My daughter  Until she was out  Of the sixth grade  So I said no  To that job  And you know  She's a nice kid  And everything  But had I known  It was going to be  This difficult  She might be going  To school  In the Bronx  Right now  But yeah  It looks like  So I got offered  A job in New York  Right away  And could not take it  But now it's getting  Close enough  Where I think  I can take it  And commute  Because she starts  The sixth grade  Are you ready  My little girl  Starts the sixth grade  On Monday 
[01:44:00]  Wow  I remember watching you  Isn't that  Was that six years ago  No  Sixth grade  No  Sixth grade  So she's 12  12  Yeah that was  Wow  You were pushing her  Around the carat  We went out to LA  When Ant and I  First started working  Together  We went through  One of those radio  It's like our first week  One of those radio tours  You were out there  We were at the comedy store  And we saw you  Pushing your newborn daughter  Around at the time  You know what  And now she's 12  And now she's 12  The funny thing about that  Is I was actually there 
[01:44:30]  As a jock  This will give you an idea  Of how desperate jocks can get  I was there as a disc jockey  And whenever  No celebrities would show up  Which is almost all the time  At those days  Yep  I would be raised  Instantaneously  From a local disc jockey  To a national celebrity  Yeah you were the A-lister  I would go around  To do a tour  Of other people's radio shows  You were the fucking A-lister man  I  Absolutely  I like to see myself  I'm much more comfortable  Being the king of the B-list  You know the A-list  Everybody's trying to throw you off  When I look at my scene 
[01:45:00]  Like the A-list is like  You know Tom Cruise  What a drag right now  It's like for me  My subjects are like  Barry Williams and Eddie Munster  You know what I'm saying  I'm the king of the B-list  That's your competition  And I'm very comfortable there  That is really really good  Yeah I've seen you turn up  On a couple of those VH1  Childhood star tragedy stories  You know and then  That really bothers me  Because my childhood  Was so fun  My you know  If they had you know  Confessions of an adult 
[01:45:30]  Ex-child star loser  Then everything about  Being a child star  Rocks  It's being an ex-child star  That sucks  In high school  I must have weighed  At 5 foot 6  I probably weighed  Close to 200 pounds  Probably about 33% body fat  And I took two  Friggin cheerleaders  To the prom  Why?  Because I was  Danny Partridge once  Stop your whining  Corey friggin' Feldman  And get a job  I heard your story  About waiting tables 
[01:46:00]  Oh god that just sucks  I will tell you  Oh it was tragic man  When I was listening to it  Being a famous busboy  Is possibly on the high end  Suck a job  Busboy  But I will tell you  I mean  This is why I feel  No matter  You know  There is this little spell  I mean I got my own TV show again  But I do radio  I don't  I'm on the season opener  Of CSI  For god's sake  In a split episode  So I'm doing fine in TV  But I hate TV  I do TV 
[01:46:30]  So I can be a famous  Disc jockey  Because I  I've been on the radio  For 16 years  I haven't worked  16 weeks  In 20 years  Of television  It's just not a  Real job  So after being  Really famous  I had to go out  And get a gig  And unfortunately  When you were famous  During your formative years  People failed  To teach you stuff  I didn't know  You know  It's not like  I was going to all of a sudden  Say  Well I think  I better be an architect  Because I've been rich  And famous my whole life  Yeah you had no skills  Except for being on TV 
[01:47:00]  So I didn't have skills  At all  So first  I did it  First I was a bartender  And that went poorly  For everybody  And then  I was a security guard  And I remember  I got arrested one time  And they interviewed  Two people  That had given me a job  And the guy that owned  The bar said  I can't believe  I gave that guy a liquor  And the guy that owned  The security company  Said I can't believe  I gave that guy a gun  Because it was  It was a pretty nice  Combination for me  So I finally became  A waiter  And that sucks  Because  Just physical confrontations 
[01:47:30]  Would happen  You know  One guy would say  Hey Partridge  My soup's cold  One too many times  Because he wouldn't realize  That 50 people  Had already said it  Yeah  Hey Danny Partridge  Exactly  Oh god  What a tool  And it's not much of an insult  Hey Partridge  My soup is cold  Yeah  But if 22 tables  Have just said it to you  You know  When you stick a fork  In this bastard's shoulder  People think you overreacted  But I heard it all day  But there were 19 shoulders 
[01:48:00]  You left alone  Exactly  Plus  You know  Now that I've made  Some sort of a comeback  I'll bet that  Four pronged scar  In his shoulder  Is a story  Yeah  You know who did that  That freak  From breaking Bonaduce  In the Partridge  Family  Stabbed me  I know  I know  I've got scars  Worth talking about  That guy gets to tell a story  The saddest thing  About that though  Was when I realized  Any job I tried to do  In public  Was going to be  A humiliation for me  But I did in fact  Have to eat  And I think at that time 
[01:48:30]  Still pay for drugs  I'm not quite sure  Of that era  So  I applied for the job  Of the lobster  For Red Lobster  Oh my god  Oh shit  The guy that stands out  On the corner  With a sign  That says Lobster Fest  Yeah  Because I had to try  And find a job  Where I could live  But people wouldn't  See my face  Oh my god  So I went in  Should have been  The Wendy's girl  And I didn't get the job 
[01:49:00]  I did not meet  The requirements  To be the lobster  What the hell  Were the requirements  I don't know  I'm hopefully  It's like Johnny Bravo  And I just didn't  Yeah  Didn't fit the suit  But there's possible  You know  They might have needed  Somebody who could  Stand erect  For at least  Eight hours at a time  And if that  Year  That wasn't me  And Danny was  Telling stories  About like  He'd be outside  And people would  Ask him to take pictures  And he'd be leaning  On a car  Take a picture  And it was his car  That he was living in  Oh yeah 
[01:49:30]  So he's famous  And homeless  A&E is doing my biography  Hold on a second  Honey  What are they doing  My biography  I'm not sure  You're not sure  What did you do here  Oh shit  For guys  I mean  That's their whole thing  Anyway  So A&E is doing  My biography  Sometime  I think  Either this month  Or early September  We just finished doing it  And I took them  On that tour  I used to live  In my car  Behind Grauman's 
[01:50:00]  Chinese Theater  And when I would  Just feel too bad  And too horrifying  I would walk  Around the corner  And stand in the middle  Of Grauman's  Chinese  And the second  Somebody would  Recognize the guys  From the Partridge family  It's every  It's on  And now I'm  This huge star  Taking pictures  With fat families  From Wyoming  And I'm signing  Autographs  And taking pictures  And these people  Have no idea  That I'm going to  Crawl back to my car  Where I live  Five minutes from now  Yeah  Jesus Christ 
[01:50:30]  That's unbelievable  Famous  Homeless  It was very awesome  It's great to know  That Hollywood  Takes care of their own  Huh  Oh well  You know what  That is  It's a feeding frenzy  Of sharks out here  And  But you know what  At some point  I have become  Either a decent shark  My own self  Or at least  A faster swimmer  And you know  You know what I mean  I wasn't raised  Nor geared  Nor hoped and dreamed  To be a game show host  But sure enough  I screw up as badly  As Breaking Bonaduce 
[01:51:00]  Was a screw up  And I still end up  With my own TV show  You just wish  You probably had tapes  From before that show  Huh  What do you mean  Like living out of your car  And all that stuff  No you don't  You know  To be honest  You weren't filming yourself  Back then  You could do a prequel  I've never actually seen  Any of Breaking Bonaduce  Because  There is  It's different  To talk about this stuff  Than to show it  I did see one clip  Apparently  My show  Is huge 
[01:51:30]  In Latin America  Huge  It was the number one show  In Mexico  The number one show  And the number one  Or two show  In Colombia  Which by the way  At the press conference  I thought they'd have  A sense of humor  This lady from  Colombia got up  And said  How does it feel  To have the number one show  In Colombia  And I said  It's about time  Some of you bastards  Sent some of my money  Back to me  And she didn't laugh  Not even a little  So I was down there  And they were dubbing  This one scene 
[01:52:00]  That I had never seen  Because I've never seen  Any of the show  Into Spanish  And it's the scene  Where my wife  Is having strippers  At some sort of  Bachelorette party  Or some such thing  And I find out about it  And I'm wasted  At this point  And I gotta tell you  I think there's a reason  That I've had some success  In radio  And that is because  Wasted out of my mind  I jump out of a moving limousine  I jump into some stranger's car  Who recognizes me  And I demand to be taken 
[01:52:30]  To the hotel  He turns out to be a lunatic  I jump out of his car  I am now  I've got cuts and bruises  I've got a blood alcohol level  Of 100%  And I grab my phone  I call my wife  And I say this  If I get to that hotel  And there's one guy  Wearing less than a turtleneck  Somebody's gonna get killed  A wearing less than a turtleneck  That's brilliant  For a drunk, violent, bleeding drunk  Yeah, the look you had 
[01:53:00]  In your eye  Was pretty scary  By the way  You should have seen  The poor Mexican actor  Trying to dub that in  Because I got really mad  I got really mad  When I saw it  I got mad all over again  And I walk into the room  With him  And through an interpreter  Who was a comedy  By the way  I'm saying  You're not angry enough  Don't you see  I'm right  I'm right  You're not mad enough  And they're all just going  Oh my god  How do we get out  Of the room with this guy  That's amazing  So are you guys  Getting along these days 
[01:53:30]  You and your wife  Honey, are we getting along  These days  No  I guess she's going  With no, apparently  That must be my website  She's  You know, we're doing okay  We're not  We're not divorced  She's right  I mean, she wouldn't be  Down here having coffee with me  We're not that kind of okay  Had I not been doing  This interview  And awakened the entire family  What about the sex life  I remember breaking Bonaduce  That wasn't really  Going well for you  The sex life  Has taken a very odd turn  Yeah  Hey honey 
[01:54:00]  Come here  I'm going to discuss  Your sex life  Without me  You're busy  That's what you say  When I actually want sex  What has happened now is  And I thought this would be great  And it's not  She will give me sex  Whenever I want it  And here's how this happened  The doctor  Who I hated  Dr. Botox  Face won't move  For two full seasons  Why didn't you punch  That guy in the face?  Because things got  Real serious with him  I  That guy 
[01:54:30]  I felt was going to  Cost me my career  Because you know  I was putting on  I will tell you  I was drunk and out of control  For a lot of that show  But for a lot of that show  I wasn't  You know  I've been successful  In mediating the wild man  Bonaduce  Through a very successful career  In the last decade  And this guy  Kept threatening  To quit the show  Over my behavior  And then VH1  Kept saying  If the doctor  Quits the show  Because you're a nut  Then insurance says  We have to close down the show  And if the show 
[01:55:00]  Closes down  Because I'm a nut  I am now a nut  Who cost somebody a show  And I've never even been  Late for work  Not once in my life  And that's bad in Hollywood  You don't get to be  This kind of raving lunatic  And late for work  You haven't really been sick  Two days and 16 years  That guy looked like  He had serious issues  During that show  Yeah he had serious  And so I really had to play  A little more careful with him  Because he kept threatening  To pull the plug  But one thing he did  That was fabulous  Is he started negotiating  Sex for me  And we came up  With this number 
[01:55:30]  Of three times a week  And everybody finally  Agreed to that  And one day  Gretchen was acting  Too busy  And I said  You don't have  Five minutes  For your husband  You don't have  Five minutes  Out of your day  That you can do this  And she said  Okay  Five minutes  So then I figured  Well that's actually  Fifteen minutes a week  She has promised me  If I could learn  To have sex  In one minute  I could then have sex  Fifteen times a week  So I'm getting it down 
[01:56:00]  Nice logic  Somewhere around  Ten times a week  But I gotta tell you  Where you would think  For guys  Fulfilling isn't really  That important  Just getting laid  Is the whole thing  Yeah  But now it's gotten  To the point  Where you know  She's still discussing  What's on her favorite soap  While we're doing it  Look who I knew  Jessica would be  Cheating on Tim  I mean I don't think  You should read  During sex  You should at least  Pretend you're interested  God why would you  Ever get married 
[01:56:30]  Everybody has these stories  Horror stories  Literally  Well  It comes down to that  Why wouldn't you  Just go rub one out  And just fuck it  Oh I do that too  Yeah  I've got a real issue there  So I do that as well  But I'll tell you  In all honesty  For the most part  I really enjoy  Being married  There are parts of me  Sometimes  Especially  You know  Now that I'm doing  Alright again  I have  What do I have on this  This next month  I've got 
[01:57:00]  CSI  The game show  Starface  Season 2  Of Breaking Bonaduce  And some other  Television show  I'm doing like  Really well  And I'll bet  I could get laid  A lot  But  On the other hand  I really do prefer  I've tried being single  You might have read about it  In the Enquirer  I would make good calls  So  I've got to say  In the long run  I actually promote marriage  And  I wouldn't be  Fooling around  Trying to fix this one  If I  You know  If I didn't love her 
[01:57:30]  And think  You know  I married the right woman  Just  She should have sex  With me more often  Alright Danny  You're a great guest man  Well thanks man  I appreciate it  And hopefully  I'll be seeing you  Back on the air shortly  Cool man  I've heard rumors  Your afternoon guy sucks  I'm only kidding  I don't know who it is  On what station  We're all over the place  Yeah I was going to say  That was an interesting thing  That day  I had no idea  You guys did morning  And then had to walk

[02:19:30]  Of O.B. and Anthony  God almighty  I challenge you  To not vomit  Radio for dummies  O.B. and Anthony  Time for the Roto-Wire  Fantasy Football Minute  Chris Liss here with Scott Pianoski  And Scott  You know I'm a little concerned  About Tomlinson  Not just his workload this season  But his cumulative workload  Over the last several  And also the fact that  There's a good chance  The Chargers go deep  Into the playoffs  With Larry Johnson  There's just  You know he's had a shorter career  And there's just a lot less  Of those workload issues 
[02:20:00]  LT's very durable  And I have a ton of respect for him  He's probably the MVP of the league  But it's not like he's indestructible  Because really no running back is  You know if you're  A Larry Johnson owner  And you don't have an emotional stake  In the Chiefs  Maybe you want them home  For the playoffs  We'll see what happens  Between now and the end of the season  If Tomlinson plays  A full playoffs  They go to the Super Bowl  And that's  You know that could be  Another 90-100 touches  So the bottom line is this  Once you're out of the playoffs  You don't want your  You don't want your back  Carrying the ball anymore  So if you're a Larry Johnson owner  Out there  Yeah you probably want the Chiefs eliminated  For the latest information  To get your fantasy football team

[02:24:00]  In Boston  About the president  Moose  Some dude  I think it was a girl  Oh my god  I know what you're  Talking about  I think it was  In yesterday's paper  Or Saturday's paper  Some girl on  The highway  Outside Lemonster  I have no idea  Really  I'm trying to be local  For the people  In that area  Yeah  And the moose  I don't know  How it happened  But the  Crashes  Or whatever  Yeah sorry  Go ahead  That blasted the moose  And the moose  Ends up  Sitting in the passenger seat  With its head  Out of the windshield  Looking around 
[02:24:30]  And it couldn't move  And they had to kill it  Because they couldn't  You gotta see this picture  It's one of the greatest  Pictures you'll ever see  The video is  Even as funny  Woman crashes into moose  Goes through the  Yeah right through the  Windshield and all that  And exactly what he said  The moose is sitting  In the passenger seat  With the head sticking out  Wow  Of the windshield  Like that's how  They were driving  The whole time  Do you know  How much  She must  Do you know  I've yelled  In my life  But do you know  How much you scream  When one minute  You're listening  To the radio  And the next minute 
[02:25:00]  A moose  Is sitting next to you  With his head  Through the windshield  You would have to  Have a heart attack  Imagine if there was  Someone with him  Especially if you got  A ticket for having  A belt on  If we can find the picture  I meant to bring it in  We should have  Scanned it for the website  It's unbelievable  And then they had  A crane to try to  Get the moose  Out of the vehicle  And unfortunately  It had a broken  Hit for something  They had a  Yeah  They had a  You're kidding  They had to do that  Euthanization  Euthanization  And then they have to  Shoot the moose  In your car  Oh  They have to kill  A moose in your car  And then drag  Its carcass back  Through the windshield  It's gonna really hurt 
[02:25:30]  The room still about you  And you know it's shit  You know the moose  Shit all over the car  Before he died  Hey we got  We got the papers  From the weekend  In the office  We might have it in there  Oh okay  Fucking poor moose  Is walking along  Next thing you know  You're sitting next to  A screaming fat lady  In Boston  Hey Rook  Nothing up my sleeve  Where's the rest  Of this moose  One must have  Hated that moose  Why don't you forget  The moose  Arthur  We got the pictures  Of the moose  Sitting nice  The moose looks 
[02:26:00]  Ridiculous  What an ass  This moose  Looks like  What goes through  The moose's head  What happened  What happened  What happened  Windshield  What happened  What a goose  This moose looks like  He was looking at him  He got a light in his face  All he wanted to do  Was eat a berry  Next thing you know  He's fucking  In a Fiat  He's a fucking  Asshole bleeding  How silly  Does that moose look  That is a silly  Looking moose  Can somebody tell the moose  The car 
[02:26:30]  Doesn't fit you  Mr. Moose  The moose has  Too many friends  That are afraid  That's like Tom Cruise  They're too afraid  To tell him  You look like  A silly goose  Mr. Moose  Mr. Moose  Wouldn't it be fun  To hit the washer  And watch him go  Like shake  His little moose head  Like the last thing  That could possibly  Annoy him  Is a little jet  Of water in his face  I would hate  To have that moose  In my car  Because he puts  Right through the windshield  If it rains  It's going to get  All over the place  And plus the moose  Probably goes duty  All over the seat 
[02:27:00]  And you have a wet moose  Do you know how scared  The moose must have been  I just hope  The car was still driving  And someone actually  Saw this taking place  Before she finally  Slowed down  I would find  The nearest toll booth  Right  They shut Mr. Moose  In the causeway  He's dead  Look how they  Messaged my moose  I hope one guy  As this moose drove by  It was a little high  Yeah  I hope there was one  A little high person 
[02:27:30]  That went right to  An N.A. meeting  Because he saw a moose  With a vehicle  Oh my god  You don't even have  To be a little high  I hope it was just  A carload of people  Completely sober  But only one guy  Saw it past them  And had to tell  His friends  What he saw  And no one  Believes him  No I did  There was a moose  In the passenger seat  And his face  Was hanging out  The windshield  I swear to you  That's mean  It was probably  Just a boy  With down syndrome  No I'm telling you 
[02:28:00]  It was like Dino  He looks like Dino  Yes  It looks like Dino  In Fred's car  I feel horrible  For the moose  Because his little  His moose arms  Are all jammed up  They're folded  Under himself  He can't even  Open the glove box  Poor fucking moose  He's probably so scared  And in pain  And in shock  But look  It's an accident  So I mean  If I were her  I would have jerked off  On the moose's head  That's what I would have done  If I showed up  I just would have  Because no one  In recorded history  Has ever jerked off  Onto the face of a moose  As it sat in the passenger seat  Of a car  No one 
[02:28:30]  Now Jimmy  We have to research that  I'll bet you  Somebody's raped the moose  I'll bet you  Some farmer  In Canada of course  Climbed up  And fucked a moose  After he hit it  No one's ever jerked off  On the face of a moose  While it just sat there  And took it  It's the best of the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  I'm fascinated  With pervs  I gotta tell you  Who is it Opie?  Because there's something  That just goes on  In their heads  Look  It's nothing different  Than what goes on  In most normal people's heads 
[02:29:00]  These perverts  These freaks  You read about them  All the time  The dentist  Well the dentist  Was the woman  The dentist story  We had about a month ago  Oh my god  The doctor  That just  You know  Is examining a woman  And he's  You know  Not even  A guy that should be  Given breast exams  But you know  He's grabbing her boobs  He's grabbing crotch  He's getting her naked  He's  You know  The dentist  Puts the woman  Under anesthesia  And she wakes up  And she's a little askew  She's feeling dirty 
[02:29:30]  For some reason  Her clothes are  A little  A little off  Because  You know  Because when you  When you violate a woman  When she's under  Uh huh  Laughing gas  You know  You're something  Expert  No  You still have to  Put her back together  You gotta put her clothes back on  You just don't do it quite right  Do you know something  I don't think a lot of guys  Know  Women adjust themselves  In bras  And they know where their boobs  Are in those bras  At all times  You ever  You ever sleep  Maybe in your underwear  And you wake up  And maybe you were rolling around 
[02:30:00]  And your underwear  Are twisting around sideways  Could you imagine  Like waking up  In the dentist chair  And all of a sudden  Your underwear are like that  You would know  There was some shenanigans  Going on  You know  Do you call it shenanigans  A little hanky panky perhaps  But you would know  Something happened  I'm sure women  Wake up and go  My boobs just don't  Feel right  In the bra  Like the nipple  Isn't pulled up enough  They're a little bent in there  Or something  You know  They smell like  The dried saliva smell  You get when you lick something  You know that awful smell 
[02:30:30]  Of dried saliva on skin  But the fascination  I have with these people  Like the dentist story  All of a sudden  Everything is normal  Everything is fine  The teeth cleaning  Is going on  And what have you  He's a dentist  He's a dentist  Doing an examination  And all of a sudden  A switch goes off  In his head  And he just loses  His mind  For a few seconds  And then his whole career  Is fucked  Just gone  Gone in a flash  Because the switch  Just goes off  In his head 
[02:31:00]  Well like any normal person  You walk the streets  You're at your job  Just like the dentist  Or something  You look at an attractive woman  And go  Wow  I would love to see those breasts  Or  What a great ass on that girl  I wonder  I wonder what it looks like  If her pants are pulled down  You know  A thong or something  Most people just think that  This guy is thinking that  She's laying in the chair maybe  He's looking  And then he's like  Yeah well  Alright  She needs a filling  I think this bicuspid's a little  I gotta feel those tits  I gotta feel the tits 
[02:31:30]  And then he does  A little  You know  I hope I gave her enough  Novocaine  Yeah there's  I'm seeing a little darkness  On that back molar  I got snatch  I'm gonna squeeze her snatch  I gotta feel this snatch  They just lose their minds  You women don't even know  What you do to guys  And these pervs  That's what happens  And we have the latest guy  Yeah  An old timer 
[02:32:00]  An old timer  Oldie timer  Look  They're seeing women  Passed out too all the time  Which has gotta be hard  Right  You're a doctor  And they're just laying  With their legs open  And a little  How do you not touch  The women  Is that a pervert I'm saying  I don't know  They're laying in that dentist chair  They got the little thing  Maybe the gas is going in  Their  Their mouth is open a little bit  Cleavage perhaps  You're seeing a little bit  You're working on the mouth  You know the mouth  Is very sensuous 
[02:32:30]  It's very sexy  And you're working on that mouth  Not when you're digging  Plac out of it  It's not  Well you know  I'm not talking about  A placard in mouth  Perhaps it's just a  Maybe the girl needs her braces  Taken off  Jesus  Or maybe  Or maybe the tooth fairy came  All right  Jesus  Jimmy  You know  And the breasts are right there  So you're working  And you know  Okay  Let's look at this  I'll check the x-ray  Because I think I saw  A spot on that 
[02:33:00]  I gotta fill up these tits  God damn it  What nice tits  But I don't get that  Thank you  You just lose your mind  Thank you for helping me out  Because yeah  The switch just goes off  In the head  Click  You know  Yeah  It's not on a dimmer  No  We all have dimmers  Like you  You think it  But you're able to  You know  Before you get that dimmer  All the way up  And you're gonna do something crazy  You bring it back down  Enough time goes by  While the dimmer's going up  For you to realize  Oh my god  I'm gonna jeopardize my job  Right  You're in the dentist 
[02:33:30]  You're working on her tooth  Maybe you're taking that  Sharp little pick thing  And you're picking at something  And then you look and go  God this girl's got  An attractive set of  Kids on her down there  But  All right  I'll scrape here  I'll do this  You know  You think that  The dimmer went up a little  But you realize  I'm gonna slide this down  What a nice body on this girl  My god  I wonder if she's single  Or married  All right  I'll check this molar  But anyway  All right  Back to my job  Okay  Let me get the x-rays  You know  It's not  You know  I'll go  I believe  If we take another x-ray 
[02:34:00]  Holy shit  I'm grabbing him  You can't  You can't just flip  The pervert switch  These guys  In that second  Just completely jeopardize  Their job is gone  You gotta have  Some kind of  Gray area  That  That  Common sense  Can delve into  And maybe  Talk you down  Don't do that 
[02:34:30]  This can be the biggest laugh  I've had on the show  Oh my god  It's the biggest laugh  Nice skin  Oh my god  I think her button  Was open on  I could see down her  Better not look  Unprofessional  This is the dimmer  Right  That we all have  Talks it down  Okay  You're able to  Common sense  Talk yourself down  As opposed to  You know  She does have a little  Plack on there  Thanks  I'm gonna  Plant  Down  Make sure this  Equipment  Is 
[02:35:00]  My god  These nipples  I have to suck them  I gotta suck her tits  Ding  Job over  Career over  In jail  Worked your whole life  To get the nice  Cushy dentist job  Yeah  And that's stupid  Oh all your years  And years of school  You're in class  You're studying  You're in your dorm  You're taking tests  You go through college  Now you gotta go through  Medical school  You go through dental school  Years and years  And that's why  Most of the guys  Never do it  Cause they start thinking 
[02:35:30]  About all that stuff  Like oh my god  I got  Know how long  It took me  To get to this point  Of course I can't  Squeeze these tits  Yeah you go  If I was insane  I would just grab  This girl's tits  But gee  You think back  Have that quick flashback  To you studying  In school  Endless nights  Of cramming  For exams  And you think  I'm not gonna give this up  Just to grab those  Of course  They're attractive  But could you  Give me the x-ray  Of this lovely  Young lady here  You know  You gotta flip that 
[02:36:00]  Turn that dimmer  Back down  But is it  Is it being a pervert  Though if all those years  How many of us  Would be strong enough  To not  I'm sure that the dimmer  Gets switched a little  Higher each time  Like maybe one time  You think  You lie to yourself  Like as you're grabbing  For something  You allow your hand  To brush her breast  And that's all you do  And you tell yourself  You didn't mean it  But every time  It becomes a little bit more  And a teeny bit more  The dimmer might move  Slowly over the years  Do you think  Maybe some of these guys  Do that  One time you have  A half of hard on  Push it against her hand  While she's out  Real quick 
[02:36:30]  And that's it  No  I think common sense  And any normal dentist  99% of dentists surveyed  They  Wouldn't do anything  Even remotely  You're probably right  But hey look  Passed out girl man  You know  Yeah  It's gotta be hard  Well anyway  We have another perv  That was busted  Now look  You know  These perverts  These older perverts  I understand the seriousness  Of all this stuff  Yeah  Trust me  But I mean  I also see the silliness  Of it as well 
[02:37:00]  I love how this guy  Screamed out  When he got arrested too  Oh I didn't read that part  He put up a little fight  And he gets arrested  And screams out  You're going to ruin my life  He knew it  Hey  At least he knew  It was coming  He knew  He was addicted  To being a perv  I guess  Yep  So it's this guy  Who's on one of the subways  Here in New York City  And the article reads  Sleazy geezer  Cops lead  William whatever  72 from the Union Square subway  Precinct yesterday 
[02:37:30]  After an undercover officer  Spotted him allegedly  Pushing against school girls  On a train  Oh  Yeah  Not cool obviously  But the whole switch thing  In the head  That's what I find silly  You know  He's probably sitting  On the subway  And all is good  With the world  Maybe it's crowded  They're all standing up  And these school girls  Come in  And they're wearing skirts  They're in their  Little school girl uniforms  And looking kind of hot 
[02:38:00]  And he's just standing there  And normal people  I know myself  If I was in there  I would take a look  Probably even out of  The corner of my eye  So as not to look like  A gawking pervert  You know  Maybe I'm looking  I'm looking at the  The billboards  That are up in the train  Or I'm looking out the window  Hey what station  Are we going to  But meanwhile  I'm just kind of  Looking going  My god  That girl's got  Some set of pins  Peeking out of her skirt  Or ooh  She has her shirt  Unbuttoned a little low 
[02:38:30]  For a little school girl  Doesn't she  For an 8th grader  Or whatever these girls  Were on the train  Right  6th grader  6th grader  And then you're like  And then you're thinking  These crazy things  You know  Thank god no one else  Could read my mind  Right right yeah  Thank god there's no  Mind readers here  Just between me  And my subconscious  Yeah  Just standing here  Like wow  That's some crazy thoughts  I just had  Ooh  Thank god my stop is next  But you get an old  Geezer pervert  He's got to stand there  I really got to start 
[02:39:00]  Reading these articles  Before we go on the air  Because there's a lot  Of funny things  Oh I know  Yeah I kind of  Read through that one  So the guy  He's on the  The 6th train  And all of a sudden  He decided  He needed to  Stand extremely close  To a group of girls  Yeah  From the nearby  Middle school  Look I know it's  You know  Whatever  But  But I'm just  I'm just thinking  This in my head  Oh yeah  This is a good one  Risky business right  Love on a train  Anyway 
[02:39:30]  Tangerine dream by the way  Thank you  Thank you  Oh is that it  Yes  Yeah so all of a sudden  He  The switch goes off  In his head  And he has to stand  Extremely close to the girls  He just loses his mind  In that split second  And then  One of the officers  Is quoted here saying  There was more than enough room  For him to stand away from them  Oh so then it must have been  Really creepy  It wasn't even like  A crowded train  Right  Where you're kind of  Brushing up against people 
[02:40:00]  Where you could get a good lawyer  And he would be like  Look man  It was a crowded train  And there was some kind of  You know  An abrupt stop  And he bumped into her  It's bouncing  The train's bouncing  Of course  No lawyers taking this case  It was him and three girls  On one car  On a train car  And he's right next to them  Yeah  All creepy  There was more than enough room  For him to stand away from them  But  He started pushing up against them  Bumping and grinding  Oh  He lost it 
[02:40:30]  He lost it  The perv switch went off  In his head  He's looking at the girls  On the train  Oh the attractive girls  And then he had to just  Cock on the leg  Right  I gotta put my cock on our leg  You know it's old man  Can't contain himself  Old man crotch just like this  Pushing forward  Oh  That old man scent  Coming off his skin  Oh  And by the way  This guy  This is why these guys 
[02:41:00]  Should be executed  He was arrested in 1989  For molesting  Eight 11 year olds  Eight 11 year olds  So the switch didn't just go off  His switch has been on  He probably just has to  Dim it down  So he doesn't get arrested  All the time  This guy's a predator  Eight 11 year olds  Jesus  Yeah  I mean it's awful  I don't even know why he's  Where do you get access  To these youngsters  Allowed to be on the subway  But as the train approached  77th street  You can't ban someone  From the subway  No I mean  Well I mean  That was an old man thing  To say  Why is he allowed on the train 
[02:41:30]  As Jimmy shakes his fist  Yeah  Alright you're right  Why you kids  They ought to ban him  From the subway  I'm thinking maybe  He should have done jail time  So then he wouldn't be  On the subway  That's what I meant to say  Along with the colored  Have you been on a subway lately  No  Guess who the minority is  Whitey  Whitey  Really  Oh my god  Yeah  As the train approached  77th street  And the girls prepared to exit  This guy grabbed at least  One of the girls  Between her legs  He just couldn't 
[02:42:00]  He just lost his effing mind  Knowing that he  He would be in deep trouble  Especially with this  1989 thing  That he has  Sometimes you just  Gotta grab it  Probably saw  A nice puffy one  Right  Right Jimmy  Yeah  Well not someone that young  Would do nothing  And he had to  But a puffy one  On an adult  And then  Listen to you  Don't protest  It's too much  Huh  You're kind of like  Well yeah  On an older one  I would  Well only because  You're using me  As a reference point  And I know  I'm such a scumbag  I had to clarify that 
[02:42:30]  You know what  I wasn't even talking  About the age of the girl  I was talking about  It's a nice one  And you gotta grab it  But no  Not a young one  No  I have to be careful  Because when I'm being  Used as a reference point  I kind of have to  Put the asterisk  Like I really  I don't go for that  But only the  Of age women  That's right  I check ID  Before I grab a twat  And kick her  Yeah  Well  But the perv  Was probably just  Sitting there  And all of a sudden  Just gets up  And just starts  Slowly making his way  Over to the girls  And then the switch  Goes on  Grab that snatch 
[02:43:00]  Gotta grab a snatch  Do you think  He pinched it  The way your uncle  Holds your face  Like when he  Put his thumb  On one cheek  And his other  Come here  Come here booby  Come here booby  You just grab it  Like that  Did she go  Oh  A little air  Probably came out  Oh god  Jesus  They talked  To a few of the  Girls in that article 
[02:43:30]  And I know  One of them  Said that  And she was  An 8th grader  And said that  A lot of times  They're on the train  And guys are always  Touching them  And she has to  Turn around  Many times  And say  Excuse me  Watch your hands  Or take your hands  Off me  I mean at this point  I don't want to be  A buzz kill  For everybody out there  But they really need  To get rid of  The catholic school girl  Skirts  Well  Slow down now  Don't  I know the school  Administrators think  It's a good idea  To have a uniform  But  Who does think  That's a great idea 
[02:44:00]  I mean  Look  I love seeing it  Like the next guy  But  Who is  In charge  And thinking this through  And here's what  The girls are doing  Too  Because I lived in  Brooklyn  And there's plenty  Of these catholic school  Girls  Where they're tying up  The  Dude  Because they still  Want to look hot  For you know  They take the white shirt  For potential boyfriends  That are their age  Go ahead sir  Untuck it from the skirt  They unbutton  The first few buttons  Down at the bottom  Of the shirt  And tie it in a knot  So now it's a belly shirt 
[02:44:30]  Their whole midriff  Is exposed  Then they take the skirt  And roll it  Up at the waistband  So it gets shorter  Shorter  Shorter  So now they've got  This rolled skirt  Around their waist  And then they pull them down  So their thong  Is showing  Out the back  The shirt is tied up  To the bottom  Of their tits  And their skirts  Are now  Mini skirts  They're really short  And they walk around  Like this  And it's a catholic school  Little outfit  It's ridiculous  You gotta have an outfit 
[02:45:00]  That's not sexy  For school  For kids  For teenage girls  But somewhere  This started  Someone said  This is a good idea  Well most of them  They were a lot longer  In the older days  They were long skirts  Somehow they pushed it up  Who was the administrator  That said  We need to make these shorter  And how did he get that through  You know  Someone had to make them shorter  And then Britney Spears  Makes that video  That one of the first ones  She did  Where she made it  Beyond cool  To have the catholic schoolgirl 
[02:45:30]  Skirt on  And she in the video  Was tying it  You know  Tying the shirt  That's what they do  And a lot of that  Japanime porn  You ever see some of that stuff  Oh my god  It's all catholic  Little young schoolgirls  In those outfits  Getting banged  By these big  Older Asian cartoon characters  I just hate Japanimation  Yeah  They just sit there  And yell  Scream  And these big  Large  Glowing cocks  Are going into them  And they pull out 
[02:46:00]  And it's  All over  Oh yeah  It's strangely erotic  Strangely erotic  Alright  So there you go  That's the latest  On the perv thing  But the perv switch  That's  That's one of the funniest  Things I've heard  On this new show bro  You just gotta  You can't control yourself  Please try to control yourself  I remember one time  I didn't do anything like this  But I was giving a woman a ride  And we decided to pull over  And she wanted me to buy her beer  I said okay 
[02:46:30]  I was probably 19 at the time  How old was she?  In her 30s  Older  She wanted you to buy her beer?  Like she'd have me money  Oh okay  I might have been 22  Oh yeah  No no no  It was a monetary  Oh boy I'm glad I cleared that up  Yeah I know  I don't want to buy a beer  What?  And she's married  Or whatever she's telling me  So we pull over to talk  And I'm trying to get her  To fool around with me  And I gotta ride  And she's just  She won't do anything  She's like no I can't  My  I got a boyfriend  But then she just  She rubs the front of my pants  Real quick 
[02:47:00]  And she goes  Oh  Like she was tempted  And the lust that ran through me  I definitely understood at that moment  How someone could just attack a girl  You were ready to  Dude it was  It was the purest lust I've ever felt  Because from her it was real  So I dropped her off  I got her the beer  I just  I mean I'm not a  Creep  So I dropped her off  And I'm driving  And I'm so turned on  I start jacking off while I'm driving  And I couldn't  I never  I'm driving down  It was in North Brunswick 
[02:47:30]  It was  I forget the name of the street  But I'm driving  And I'm jerking off  And then I saw my friend Dean walking  So I put my mule away real quick  And pulled over  And talked to him  But that was  I had to finish up later  Yeah but I mean  I understood at that moment  That's how those things happen  You get so hit  With that lust  You can't  You can't do anything about it  Knowing you  I'm surprised you didn't say  Do you mind if I just  You know  Take this out then  And take care of myself  With you in the car  Believe me right now  That's exactly what I do  But I was younger  Back to that  You're an M.O.

[03:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Howard sucks, Robin sucks, and they're the funniest, and they rule.  And now, back to the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, Anthony, you brought in the parents-to-child, parents-talk-to-child-about-sex thing?  Yeah, that's one of the many educational films I was going through.  You know how you're cruising around on the Internet, and you're just kind of, you don't know how you end up at some place, but you're there?  It's kind of one of those situations.  I'm going around, and I ended up on this film archive site. 
[03:00:30]  They had everything.  You know, you want to see presidential speeches from the past and stuff from NASA and all just American history, world history, actually.  And one of these archives was educational and industrial films.  There's just a slew of them.  So I'm checking them all out, and they had ones on perversion.  And there were whole films on how girly magazines and men's fitness magazines cater to the homosexual. 
[03:01:00]  Don't let your child read these.  He can turn into a homosexual.  Very angry at the homosexual.  And one of them was called Boys Beware.  We got to pull clips from that one.  It's a whole thing on how boys have to beware of homosexuals that drive around in cars trying to pick them up at the basketball court in the high school.  And they have these scenarios that play out, and it's so funny.  Guy comes over, and he offers a boy a ride home, and the boy takes it, and he gives him a gentle pat on the shoulder. 
[03:01:30]  Leads the boy to believe everything's going to be okay.  And then, like, next weekend, he was back at the school driving Billy home.  He decided to ask him if he wanted to go fishing.  They went fishing the next weekend.  This is where he showed Billy some pornographic photography.  And he shows him pictures.  And before you know it, they were walking up into a hotel room together. 
[03:02:00]  And he put his arm around Billy.  Oh, it's the excuse that the homosexual used.  If things like this happen, be sure to tell your parents before it's too late.  And you're led to believe that the kid takes it right up the keister in the hotel by the homo.  But how did he get him up into the hotel room?  He just talked him into it.  And he talked him into it.  And then the next scene is Billy and his parents, with Billy with his head down, walking out of the police station.  Not being able to sit down.  Billy finally told his parents. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  And you just know he was ravaged.  What kind of good pedophile takes a kid out four times before he bangs him?  Oh, I know.  He was, like, dating this kid.  What if it happened to a shallow grave after the first date?  Oh, God.  That was another one, which I guess ended pretty quickly.  A kid on a basketball court.  His friends left, and the kid wanted to play.  You know, Johnny wanted to play a little longer.  And this guy comes out and offers to play a game with him.  And it's just this big, oafish, old guy with the horseshoe bald head and the glasses. 
[03:03:00]  And he's playing basketball with the kid.  And he offers him a ride home.  And he goes, little did he know, he traded a little more time at the basketball court.  For his life.  His life?  His life.  That's it.  This guy was thorough.  No dating and fishing for him.  Yeah, this guy wasn't about waiting a month to see what the little boy had.  It's a hollow, hollow, shovel over the head.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, those clips are coming.  And there was no distinction in this between homosexuality and predator pedophile murder. 
[03:03:30]  It was just, they were all grouped together.  The homosexual will prey on children.  So we got parents.  This is a little different.  This is parents being educated by these doctors on sex, how to tell their kids about sex.  And a lot of it is played out in scenario and conversation.  All right.  The first clip is mommy talks about vagina.  Yes, she does.  Mommy, I want to ask you something.  What is it, dear? 
[03:04:00]  I know that the baby goes inside you.  That's where Johnny was.  But he seems so big.  What I wonder is, how does he get out of there?  Oh.  Your belly button?  It's too small.  Mary, the baby doesn't come out of your navel.  Let me tell you how it is.  Oh, boy.  There's a special opening just in front of the place where you have your BM. 
[03:04:30]  Your what?  It's very, very tiny and a little girl.  It's a special opening right in front of the hole that you have your BM.  Your Big Moody from My Bodyguard?  How funny is that?  And you'll notice later in life that because you have that, it's the only reason men talk to you.  It is a special hole, isn't it?  Yeah.  Because it's a special hole.  Just in front of the place where you have your BM.  It's very, very tiny and a little girl. 
[03:05:00]  But as you grow, it grows too, right along with the rest of you.  Slut.  Until when you're grown up, it gets to be just about this size.  Now, when the baby's ready to be born, it stretches up to be about this size.  Holding her hands three feet apart.  Just big enough for the baby to slip through, head first.  Then after the baby's born, it goes back to its regular size.  No, it doesn't.  Do you remember how big my tummy stretched when the baby was growing in there?  Only if you have a good doctor.  And now, see, I'm flat again.  I'm back to my regular size. 
[03:05:30]  Do you understand?  Why does Daddy beat you?  I think so.  But if I forget it, you can always tell me again.  Maybe when Tabby has her kittens, you can see how they come.  I like that, but there's something else.  How did the baby get started in this?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Daddy comes home drunk from the office, smelling of whiskey, and flips Mommy over. 
[03:06:00]  Remember that special hole I was talking about?  Daddy doesn't treat it that special.  He makes you the BM.  A bloody mess.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  The special opening that little girls have, the one I told you about, has a name, the vagina. 
[03:06:30]  Aha.  Now, you know that little boys like our Johnny have a penis.  You see his penis when we change his diapers.  Yes.  When a boy grows up and is ready to be a father, he is able to put his penis into the vagina.  Right.  That special opening that mothers have, and when he does this, he can plant the seed that  starts a baby to grow.  Isn't this little girl a little too young to know this much?  Yeah.  It's very wrong.  It is very wrong when you watch it. 
[03:07:00]  The kid's much too young.  Shut up.  Go outside and play.  The mother's leaving out the whole foreplay thing.  All the good stuff.  The whole, always hold the bag, honey.  You know?  This mother stinks.  That's an awful lay.  Put it in.  You just know she lays there.  Now put it in my special hole, dear.  Plant your seed.  Oh, God.  I'm going back to my secretary.  You stink.  All right. 
[03:07:30]  The next clip is about masturbation.  Yes.  Let me at this point make a clear-cut scientific statement.  Masturbation is not harmful.  The young child often plays with his genitals, and after puberty, masturbation is a common  release mechanism for the sex drive.  Growing boys will either masturbate to get rid of this energy or have a nocturnal omission,  the so-called wet dream.  Since sexual fantasies or dreams often accompany these experiences,  the teenager will sometimes feel guilty or ashamed. 
[03:08:00]  What he needs right then is reassurance from his parents that they know these things happen  and that the experience itself is not harmful to health or to normal growing up.  Not important at all.  It should be viewed as just a passing phase.  That lasts a lifetime.  Parents will very long add to guilt by terrifying the teenager with fables and myths  or by giving the impression that the genital areas are evil or taboo.  These misstatements and misconceptions are the real danger.  Writing a song parody? 
[03:08:30]  Taboo.  You're doing a radio show with Anthony?  Tell him it's okay to put it wherever he wants.  That's creepy, man.  Yeah.  Thank God he wasn't teaching me that crap.  No.  Who's listening to that guy about masturbation?  Funky Treasure says,  Sometimes Daddy puts it where Mommy has her BM.  Oh, that's great. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, these films are really funny.  What is BM, by the way?  A bowel movement.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  That's an olden days term for going to the bathroom or taking a dump.  BM.  A BM.  Or making poo-poo or poopies, as they tell the kids these days.  Toolbag Johnson from New Orleans writes,  Doesn't BM stand for bend movement?  Old gravy leg.  Dear, it's this special hole right in front of the place that makes you have gravy legs.  You're going to need club soda when Ricky comes back, because we're running out of things to do. 
[03:09:30]  Getting a little short.  All right, good.  All right, so the next clip is the doctor talking about wet dreams, I guess.  Is this, uh...  We really want the homosexual audio.  Oh, yeah, we'll get to that.  That's on the way.  This is great stuff, though.  I love this stuff.  Every so often, I get a strong sex surge, and the only way I can take care of it is to masturbate.  And when I do, I feel awful.  It's just like I've committed a crime or something.  And it worries me, and I say, well, I won't do it anymore. 
[03:10:00]  And when I do, it goes away for a while, and I come back and do it again.  And when I do control myself for a while, I end up with a wet dream.  Well, Jimmy Norton, what you have to do is calm down.  You're a sex addict.  Oh, gee, like I committed a crime, Beev.  I know, it sounds like leave it to Beaver.  You know, Wally, I was playing with myself last night, and I felt like a creep. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, don't worry about it, Beev.  Mom has to wash my sheets every hour on the hour.  I'm jerking it all the time.  Well, me and Lumpy went out behind in the house in the woods, and he was all lumpy in his pants.  And I won't even tell you what happened to Whitey.  It was all Whitey in my face.  It sounds like, because it is from the same time. 
[03:11:00]  It's in the 50s, so they get these whiny little kids.  Oh, and I didn't know what I'm doing.  Just grab it, crank it, and go out.  Have fun.  Next thing you know, I'm feeding a hooker a bran muffin, laying underneath her, yelling, bombs away.  Like a creep or something.  It's okay to take logs on your chest.  Don't be embarrassed.  All right.  I need to do this all the way. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, man.  Cool.  Beaver!  Beaver!  Gee, I hope Dad doesn't come up here and catch me spanking the monkey, Wally.  Oh, it's okay.  Dad does it all the time.  Mom doesn't like getting it in her special hole in front of the place she has her BM.  So, is this how you do it, Wally? 
[03:12:00]  Sure, Beev.  Just grab on and crank away.  Everything will be fine.  But what if I make a mess?  That's what Mom's for, Beev.  To clean up our mess.  Sure, Beev.  The men in the house make messes everywhere.  Whether it's in that special hole or on the sheets like you boys.  Mom will clean it up.  Because that's her job.  It's the 50s.  She's there to clean up our sexual fluids and to take my punches in the face when I'm pissed off from a day at the office. 
[03:12:30]  Now, crank away, kids, and don't worry about the laundry.  That's Mom's job.  She also cooks a mean pot roast.  Isn't it nice to have someone to clean up your fluids and make a nice roast at the end of it all?  It's the 50s.  And it's wonderful.  The 50s just seemed so great.  Everyone was stupid. 
[03:13:00]  If you missed the 50s, move to Toronto.  They're still living it.  Are they?  Oh, my God.  Hey, I want to talk about masturbation, eh?  A boot.  Put a boot in your dog's liver.  What's this swimming naked clip?  Oh, well, they're just discussing things, Opie.  The adolescent boy has other problems, too.  I'm talking about his problems in growth and development, which can be as disturbing to him as his sex pressures. 
[03:13:30]  Boy, how do I always get the top locker?  Two boys in the locker room.  I know that junior team you're on looked pretty good today.  You guys better watch out.  You might make the finals.  Yeah, but we'd be a lot better if I were bigger.  I'm sure getting tired waiting to grow up.  It's no fun being such a scrawny kid.  It may sound funny to you, but...  Boy, when I change my pants, I like to crawl in that locker I feel so undeveloped.  That's not so funny. 
[03:14:00]  Before we moved here, I used to go to a school where we had to go swimming in the bear.  I was so embarrassed about the size of my penis that we used to dread the days we had to go swimming.  Even though it was my best sport, I was good at it, too.  Boy, like you, boy, what I wouldn't have given for a fig leaf.  For a big shawl tree.  Well, how do you think I feel?  He's got a little dick.  That is so funny.  What school is he going to where they swim naked?  Dude, we talked about stuff like this in the past, and a bunch of people came out of the woodwork saying that they were forced to swim naked in high school. 
[03:14:30]  Unbelievable that that was actually going on.  They would swim naked?  Could you imagine?  Gee, Dad, I feel a little embarrassed going swimming.  I feel like a creep or something.  I get in the pool and I got a little schlong.  That's okay, Beaver.  I had a little schlong when I used to go swimming, but look how big and thick and fat it's gotten. 
[03:15:00]  Whoa, Dad, put that away.  That's what your mom says right before I put it where she has her BM.  And then she just says, ouch, ooch.  And she has to wash the sheets again.  That's her job, you know.  You know, Dad, sometimes when you go to work, Eddie Haskell comes over and Mom makes the same sounds in her bedroom that she makes when you're in there.  Well, really?  How about that, Beaver? 
[03:15:30]  Eddie Haskell's becoming quite a man.  You know, someday, those girls at school are going to want you to put it in the special hall.  And that's when you flip them over and put it in their balloon knot.  What's a balloon knot, Dad?  Well, blow up a balloon, tie it in a knot, and look into where you just blew.  What does that look like?  Oh, I get it, Dad. 
[03:16:00]  It's the place where the BM comes from.  Sure.  Sure it is.  God, the 50s rocked.  Wish I was there.  Do anything you want.  Here you go, dude.  Everything was in black and white.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  We used to swim naked in school.  Told you.  Naked in school.  All right, so you're what?  You're 60 years old?  36.  I'm 36.  Where were you swimming naked? 
[03:16:30]  We were in Cheektawaga outside of Buffalo, New York.  That makes sense now.  And what would they say?  What was the first day you had to do this?  What was that like?  Um, it was like, uh, what the fuck?  I gotta get naked and swim with fucking 30 guys?  And the teacher just said, take your clothes off?  Yeah.  They did not give us bathing suits, and we weren't allowed to wear bathing suits because  they said that the soap clogged the filters or something like that.  Yeah.  And, uh, I know a lot of guys who all had to do it the same thing, and I mean, it was 
[03:17:00]  fucking weird.  And, uh, once I got into high school and stuff, I was like, I ain't doing this anymore.  I mean, what the fuck?  You play chicken with fucking a naked sack on your neck?  You know?  Fuck that.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I told you, Ant.  I didn't know that was going on.  The logic of it is crazy, but, uh.  This day and age.  Mike in Jersey.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[03:17:30]  Hey.  Hey, uh, you really pulled a boner this time, B.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, some words take on different meanings.  We had to take a Roman wrestling when I was in school.  Don't be such a baby.  Stop it.  They did not.  I'm just joking.  Yeah.  Take care, guys.  You never know, though.  They did, in the older days, do that.  Not, like, really older, but in school, they would have the kids wrestle naked.  Come on.  Ugh.  No way.  No, I read that.  Mac, what's up?  In one of those homosexual magazines. 
[03:18:00]  Opie, Opie, kill the fit, man.  They're new sponsors.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Kill the fit.  It's a new sponsor.  Probably.  Very funny.  Very good.  All right.  One hit.  So we're back to this?  Yeah.  If you're just tuning in, we're playing intern runaround today.  I think he's up to five or, I don't even know anymore.  This is, I think, his sixth trip.  You don't have to act.  Out into the tundra.  Eric's all mad.  I'm like, you don't have to act.  He's gone.  What's the matter?  It was supposed to be a salted bagel with cream cheese.  It's plain with nothing. 
[03:18:30]  Uh-oh.  It's a cream cheese bagel with salt.  All right, Anthony, the next clip is about menstruation.  Ah, menstruation.  There's been a real change in our approach to education about menstruation.  It's hard to believe what grandmother experienced, but let's hear her story.  Here's grandma talking about it.  I'll never forget when I was 14 years old, I went to the little outhouse on our farm.  Outhouse.  My new dress was stained, and there was blood on my underclothes. 
[03:19:00]  Uh-huh.  Hey, really, granny.  Sounds hot.  Did grandpa put it where you B.M.?  Maybe it was read from slaughtering an American Indian, you rotten old bag.  We had just returned from a lynching when I noticed I was bleeding.  The front of my underpants looked like I was attacked with a bingo splatter. 
[03:19:30]  Old copper panties.  Oh, God.  All right, wow.  Blood on my underclothes.  I ran inside and showed my mother.  And all she said was, you're menstruating.  And turned and walked away.  I had to find out how to take care of myself from my cousin. 
[03:20:00]  Were any of your girlfriends told in advance by their mothers?  No, I'm afraid not.  They were just as scared as I was.  Laura Ingalls, all of them.  The doctor's sisters who told them.  One thing I was sure of, I would never let this happen to my daughter.  Why do you suppose your mother didn't tell you in advance?  Ignorance.  Just plain stupid ignorance.  Well, calm down, granny.  She's got some mother issues.  No kidding.  I remember.  And then this young Union soldier came by my house and he had fired a shot. 
[03:20:30]  It went through his testicles and hit me in the ovary and I was pregnant.  You can read about me on urbanlegends.com.  What's .com?  I have no clue.  It's the 50s.  Oh, my big bloomers just stained.  Oh, that just sounds awful.  Disgusting.  That's funny, though.  I was dirty.  Well, here we go. 
[03:21:00]  A little discussion about sanitary napkins.  Ah, here you go.  Mommy, what's this?  Well, I guess, honey, you're old enough now to understand these things.  She's one.  Those are sanitary pads for me, honey.  Yeah, really.  Ah, mommy, what's this?  Well, here you go.  He takes his big schlong.  Ah, let's start over.  Hold on.  Okay.  Come on.  Mommy, what's this? 
[03:21:30]  Well, I guess, honey, you're old enough now to understand these things.  Those are sanitary pads for me, honey.  You know that mothers have a special place inside them where the babies grow before they come out?  Well, each month in a grown-up woman, a soft, nasty place builds up.  Soft, nesty place or nasty place?  Nasty?  A soft, nesty place.  That's how she's describing her womb. 
[03:22:00]  It's the 50s, though.  She should be describing the outside of it as nesty.  Nasty and nesty.  Looks like a vulture's nest out there.  You just know it's big and awful.  No hygiene going on down there.  A grown-up woman, a sort of soft, nesty place builds up.  And some of the nests is blood.  And if a woman is going to have a baby, she needs this nest for the baby to grow in.  Now, let me tell you what's had to do.  If no baby has started there, then the blood in the nest isn't needed. 
[03:22:30]  And it just dribbles out of the vagina for a few days.  Dribbles.  Sometimes mommy sneezes and stains the linoleum.  That's awful.  Do they explain crime scene sex?  Dribbles.  No.  No.  And then a fresh new nest place starts building up. 
[03:23:00]  That's what the pads are for, to catch the blood.  Does it hurt?  It shouldn't.  It's something that happens to every girl when she grows up.  Now, have a lucky.  You're old enough.  Light up a lucky.  Puff away, dear.  What are you now, two?  Here you go.  It's lucky children's cigarettes.  Smoke for your health.  Now included with your dolly, a pack of lucky stripes. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, soft, nasty, nasty.  A lot of great and some feedback coming in, by the way.  Big dog from Texas.  Ben didn't want to swim naked because his dong would drag along the bottom.  Unfortunately, I can't do impressions, but Funky Treasure from CringeHuber.net.  Did you read this one?  I'm not sure.  He writes this a lot every morning. 
[03:24:00]  Wally, I saw mom make a BM on dad's chest last night.  Gee, Wally.  I don't want you to get scared by what you saw last night, Wally.  Dad, it was kind of creepy.  Gee, Dad, I saw mom squatting over you.  And she was having a BM on your chest.  Wally, although on the outside this might look odd, it's quite pleasurable when mom drops logs on my chest. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, sure, we've done that ever since college.  It might stink a little, and, well, I don't tell the boys down at the office about it, but it's perfectly normal.  Maybe when you're out on a date, you could have a girl drop logs on your chest or face if you're a real trooper.  You know, it started years ago when I used to play Monster Rain with some of the boys in my neighborhood. 
[03:25:00]  Monster Rain, Dad?  Sure, Wally.  That's when you yell, Monster Rain's coming, and run under the porch, and all of a sudden we fillet each other.  Ha-la-la-la, ha-la-la-la.  Ain't the 50s great?  Gee, I'm going to go play that with Eddie Haskell, Dad.  Sure, you go run off and play.  Monster Rain.  And grab a couple of luckies on your way out and puff away. 
[03:25:30]  I love a lucky strike.  And striking your mom.  It's the 50s, you know.  So did we play the sanitary napkins one, sort of?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, yeah, we got through that one.  And then J-Mac from Philly writes,  Why does Ann have to tell everyone he isn't taking part in the gag?  Why does he have to separate himself from the group all the time?  I'm offended by it.  All right.  Ann talks about her period? 
[03:26:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's get this one out here.  A little period talk.  Come on.  Ann, when did you first learn about menstrual periods?  Oh, I really can't remember.  I just always sort of seem to know something about it, and I knew that I'd have them someday.  I do remember, though.  I knew that I'd have them.  Like, I don't know where this accent is from, but it's horrible.  Nothing sexy about this.  I knew I'd have them.  Yeah, yeah.  When I started to develop, my mother reminded me that I'd probably be starting soon, 
[03:26:30]  and that's when she went into the sort of information that you gave in the animation.  It's not as clearly as that, but I felt I knew what the score was.  And then she did a very practical thing.  She gave me a belt and a pad, and I was all set.  A belt and a pad.  My friends' mothers didn't do it this well, though.  Among my friends, it really ran the gamut about what they knew and what they didn't know.  A belt and a pad.  Ah, the good old days. 
[03:27:00]  You had to buckle up like a fighter pilot when you have your period.  With a Gucci belt buckle.  We ought to give pads and belts for them.  For Noah.  Have him wear that around the office.  A belt and a pad.  A pad and a belt.  Nice.  Any ithers?  One more?  No one ever mentions that you can wear two pads on a heavy day  or that tampons are all right, even if you aren't married.  What is that about?  Well, you didn't want to put anything in there if you're not married, 
[03:27:30]  because then if you have a husband who's checking you out,  you know, some husbands would actually check out the woman and make sure she's intact,  and women were afraid that a tampon would break that  and make her look like a slut to a husband who's searching for a virgin.  All right.  No one ever mentions that you can wear two pads on a heavy day  or that tampons are all right, even if you aren't married.  The fact is, a lot of girls do get cramps in the first couple of days,  and I know then I'm limited for some sports. 
[03:28:00]  You mean that what you really needed to know is that menstruation is a nuisance,  but not something terribly unpleasant.  To guys.  Oh, I don't know.  But after a few periods, a girl becomes very aware of some of these nuisance factors.  Really, they're just inconveniences for the most part.  Of course, it's nothing like my mother's day, not nearly so restricted.  You should hear my mother laugh about her high school gym class.  Yes.  All the ladies who were having their periods had to get in their gym suits. 
[03:28:30]  Then they sit along the sidelines, radiating their attainment of womanhood  and smugly enjoying their female-ness, while the rest of them whack the volleyball.  Whack the volleyball.  Ugh.  What an accent.  Pads.  I wear pads.  That is weird.  That is weird stuff.  Straight through all, whacking a volleyball, and Mom and her other friends are just there  bleeding against the wall.  Bleeding against the wall. 
[03:29:00]  Ugh.  That is disgusting.  I love...  Big, thick double pads on there.  Dribbling out.  Ugh.  Looks like Dracula with Down Syndrome.  Dracula.  Sometimes I'd have to wear two pads.  Ugh.  It was pretty disgusting when I had to put on two pads.  It looked like I was wearing a diaper.  You know, a bloody diaper. 
[03:29:30]  Ugh.  You should tell your children about this so they're not embarrassed.  What an awful accent that was.  Sometimes I wish I'd be sexually active, but not with this accent.  God damn it.  I'm banging Sipowitz over here.  Hey, come on.  Put it in my ass.  Come on, you lousy skill. 
[03:30:00]  That's horrible.  Oh, how cute.  There's Katie doing some sledding this morning on the Today Show.  Hit a tree.  Leaving a red stripe down the mountain.  I'm having my period.  That's great.  That was all they had back then.  Education.  You don't see those anymore.  Do they still even play stuff like that in school?  They have to update it.  We're so PC now that everything's got to be just right.  So I think they would just opt not to make these anymore. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're damn interesting to watch.  I was watching some.  I didn't bring in any, but on wartime propaganda.  And some of the films back then, they had this film that was about the Japanese during World War II.  And it was supposed to be a Japanese guy talking.  It was an American guy dressed up in makeup like a Jap.  And he's like, let me tell you about my Japan.  We are working the war effort to beat you, American.  And it was just the most racist, hate-filled thing I've ever seen. 
[03:31:00]  It was great.  Where's our propaganda music that we were playing last week?  All right.  We'll get it.  You know some of these things are directly responsible for the A-bomb being dropped.  Because they went into like, you know, so send your people over.  We will fight to the last man.  There are millions of us here in Tokyo and all over Japan that will fight.  We will never stop.  Send your waves of soldiers over.  We will beat them. 
[03:31:30]  We will kill all of you.  And it's got to be like, geez, this guy sounds serious.  Why don't we just drop a huge bomb from the sky and kill them all?  You know?  And as you land back on the safe runway of your base, you can light up a Lucky Strike cigarette.  Yes, when that match lights and the end of your lucky glows, think of the glowing Japs in  Hiroshima, writhing in pain and radiation as you draw that fresh, clean tobacco taste of 
[03:32:00]  your Lucky Strike.  And know when you go back home, the Japs will be sitting in internment camps, never to annoy  you with their funny faces.  Light up a Lucky Strike and celebrate America's victory.  For the animal Japanese, they aren't really human, you know.  When you burn them out of their caves with your flamethrowers, use that last spark to  light a Lucky.  Yes, American troops, smoking Lucky, being Lucky, Lucky Strike. 
[03:32:30]  Every Lucky you smoke stands for a dead Jap.  Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Hmm.  I ain't got nothing on.  That's right.  That was funny.  My tank ran dry.  The best of the worst of Opie and Anthony must pause for a break.  Diddle until your privates turn raw.  Shut up, stupid!  The virus.

How you doing, man?  Can you hear us? 
[03:37:30]  Hello?  Hello.  Bob, can you hear us?  Yeah, I can hear you guys fucking with me with that whole thing.  No, no, we're actually not.  We're not.  We're actually out of time with the phones.  The phones are my problems all day.  Oh yeah, what's up, man?  Colin was in the other day, and he was telling us a story about you and Seinfeld.  And it was a little embarrassing?  Uh, yeah, that friggin' son of a bitch Seinfeld douchebag. 
[03:38:00]  Would you like to tell us the story?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on the Tonight Show right now.  Hey Johnny.  Norton's Ed.  I don't want to be Ed.  I want to be Doc.  Take one up the keister.  Is he gay?  I, uh...  He always seemed a little flamboyant.  Seemed a little Noah-like.  That's like...  Remember when he was filming Comedian?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seinfeld.  Well, he was...  That son of a bitch was coming down with this little camera crew, and...  I never talked to him. 
[03:38:30]  I never said nothing to him.  I never said nothing to famous people when they come down there.  And there's certain comedians...  You're talking about the Comedy Cellar, by the way, where most of that movie comedian was filmed.  Yes.  Thank you.  Where all the big-time New York comics hang out when they're not on the road.  Right.  All right, there you go.  Sorry.  Thanks.  So, this son of a bitch comes down.  I never said nothing to him.  I just, you know, some comedians kiss their asses, you know.  Yeah.  Especially if he was filming, so there were certain comedians, Godfrey, that would just... 
[03:39:00]  You know, sticking their faces in.  And I never said nothing to him.  One night, he says something to me.  I say something back.  I feel like we build up a rapport.  Ha ha.  Rapport?  You know what I mean?  Like, it was like...  What did he say?  It was me?  Yeah.  What's the code?  Because there's a door code to get down.  Is this seat taken?  Well, you know, it was kind of like a little conversation we had.  Yeah.  What was it about, Bob?  Was it something like... 
[03:39:30]  All right.  So, it wasn't that much of a conversation.  But it was enough for me to maybe say hi to him again.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He said...  Did he ask why you were looking at that midget and crying?  Ooh.  Is that the first time he's done it?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right.  Where's that midget on?  I'll never live that down.  No.  You won't.  And you wonder why I fuck sinks.  What the heck? 
[03:40:00]  So, I went and I did this gig up in Buffalo two days later.  The worst gig of my life.  I have to hire my own driver to pick me up to drive me to the gig.  Ooh.  This guy picks me up in a van.  One of those, you know, one of those, you know, cool vans with the captain seats and the TV and the, you know, VCR.  Nice.  So, he's got every Seinfeld episode ever, ever, ever. 
[03:40:30]  And he's got headphones on.  And he's not watching and he's listening to them.  Jesus.  This guy's a Seinfeld freak.  So, we go.  We're driving to the gig.  He's telling me about Seinfeld.  He finds out I'm a comedian.  He starts calling me Jerry.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  I took him out.  We went to lunch, you know, because we had like an hour to kill.  Yeah.  So, the whole time he's telling me about, you know, his family and he's, you know, he's like, Jerry.  And I'm like, Bob.  He's like, oh, I know, but I just really like Jerry.  So, I'm like, okay, call me Jerry. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, my God.  That's weird.  Did he ask you to listen to an audio cassette of his stand-up and put you on his show?  Jerry.  Jerry.  So.  Ma.  Nice talking to you.  So, this guy, this guy asked me for an autograph.  But, you know, I was like, you know what?  I might be able to get you one.  Because I just talked to him the other night for the first time, me and my new buddy.  Yeah.  So, then I go to do this gig.  It's outside, after a band, in the rain, in the afternoon, next to a skydiving simulator, at a beer fest. 
[03:41:30]  So, how was the gig?  It was all right.  It wasn't that bad.  I pulled it off.  You pulled it off.  So, this gig was hell.  So, I go back to New York.  I met this guy.  I mean, I lived this Seinfeld episode.  Yeah.  This guy, the whole gig with the thing and the flight simulator.  I can't wait to see Jerry and tell him the gig, you know, tell him about the gig. 
[03:42:00]  So, the first time we talked, we made a bet.  I was making bets, and he jumped in on the bet.  So, I owed him a buck because he won the bet.  That's why that was our conversation.  Oh, okay.  So, he's on stage.  Do you remember what the bet was?  Yeah.  It was if Gretzky was on the team when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup, and no, he wasn't.  All right.  And so, he walks off stage, and I got my dollar out, and there's, like, a crowd of people going nuts. 
[03:42:30]  He walks by me at the foot of the stairs in the cellar, and I go, here's your buck.  You won the bet.  And he looks at me with, like, almost take that, you know, he could smell dog shit, but he doesn't know where it is.  And he took the buck, which kind of annoyed me that he took the buck.  Of course.  And he didn't say nuts.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  He took it.  Yeah.  I go, but I got a story for you first.  He goes, you want your buck back?  So, in my head, I'm like, what a fucking dick. 
[03:43:00]  And he walks up two stairs.  He turns around, and he goes, I'll be upstairs in the back corner eating.  So, when you're done, come up, and we'll talk upstairs.  So, I go, all right, man.  I'll be up.  I'm doing my set.  Right after my set, I'll come up.  We'll sit.  We'll talk.  He goes, not you.  He was talking to the lady next to me. 
[03:43:30]  I was so, you understand, there's a crowd of people there.  The lady next to me looked at me like, I'm sorry.  And then he just walked up the stairs.  How embarrassing.  Oh, for that split second, you're like, oh, my God.  Jerry's inviting me up to his table.  I'm going to hang.  And then, not you.  Just the fact that I assumed that he would invite me from two sentences to sitting down 
[03:44:00]  and having food with the guy.  Right.  And I'm like, yeah, I'll be right.  I said it so confident.  I was like, good, I've got to do my set.  But right when I'm done with my set, I'll be up and I'll join you.  And then we'll talk about stories.  I've got to do my craft.  Not you.  And that Jew voice.  That is just big, fat lips.  Just not you.  That's a good story.  Oh, that rings through my head. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, of course it does.  Someone says, not you, it rings through my fucking head.  You know how embarrassing it is when you're walking down the street and someone waves  and goes, hey, and you wave back and then you realize it's somebody behind you that they're  waving at you and you're all embarrassed.  It's got to be that times a thousand because it's Jerry Seinfeld and you're in front of  people and that is the worst.  When Colin told me that, I couldn't stop laughing and feeling bad for you.  I cried like you at a midget wedding. 
[03:45:00]  Dude, I, let me tell you something.  I, in my head, in like a split second, I literally saw myself being on his new show.  See?  I'm on the new Kramer and I was just a superstar.  For a split second, like.  Colin, Colin, just blowing him off.  Jerry's inviting me to his table.  This is great.  All right, I'll be, I'll be up right after I do my, uh, my set.  Not you.  I finally made it.  Like Jerry will tell people about Bob, like, oh, you got to sit and talk to this guy. 
[03:45:30]  He's out of his mind.  He's crazy.  Yeah.  Bob, they've, um, they've offered me a show and, uh, I need a help.  Uh, I need a writer just like, uh, Larry was on Seinfeld.  I'd like you to be on, uh, this new project I'm working on.  Yeah, we need a professional, uh, person who knows about, uh, eating ass and, uh, all those.  And effing sinks and, uh.  Maybe you could be the tear Nazi.  The tear Nazi.  People come in with a sad story and you just cry and they walk out of your establishment. 
[03:46:00]  God forbid I show emotion to a little girl who can't touch her face.  Little girl?  She was a woman.  Just happened to be a two foot tall.  We finally got the audio of that.  We're going to play after the break, by the way.  Finally.  We've been looking for that audio for weeks.  All right, Bob, we're going to let you go.  We might call you back because I think we're going to play the midget audio as well today.  All right, guys.  I love all you guys.  You're the best, Bob.  Not you.  Well.  See you, man.  Bye.  All right, there he goes, Bob Kelly. 
[03:46:30]  Is that just an embarrassing story?  That's great.  Like, are you looking up the stairs at Jerry and looking down at you?  He says, when you're done, come on up.  We'll eat and talk.  And for that split, because you know, as a comic, he's standing there going, this is great.  Oh, my God.  What an in.  You know, if you're going to network with a comedian, Seinfeld's the guy that you want to network with.  The guy, you know, took stand-up comedy and turned it into what every stand-up comic wants,  the most successful sitcom in history, you know? 
[03:47:00]  And there he is, ready to go.  All the fantasies rushing through Bob's head.  Oh, yeah, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to tell.  The friends he's going to tell.  He's thinking about the friends he's going to tell that he hung out with Jerry, and he  invited him up to his table.  And the comedians that will see him walking in.  Right.  Like, we're all walking in, and there's Bob at Seinfeld's table chatting, having some fun.  All the way, Jerry throwing his head back, laughing at Bob's banter.  Bob.  And Bob going, dude, I just can't do it.  I can't give you six weeks, Jerry. 
[03:47:30]  I can't.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  And then in that split second, in that split second, not you.  Because the comedy show, when you walk out of the showroom, you can make a right to leave,  or the steps up to the left will take you up to the olive tree, and it's very cramped.  Yeah.  And everybody, if Seinfeld was speaking, everybody is silently listening.  Of course.  Everyone heard it. 
[03:48:00]  What a wonderfully horrible story.  Oh, dude, it's just awful.  Razzle Dazzle.  We'll be back with the reruns after this.  Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh.  Crunch laugh, crunch laugh, crunch laugh.  Oh, why doesn't everybody just cut the malarkey?  Opie and Anthony.  College football on XM Satellite Radio in 2006.

College football on XM Satellite Radio, part of XM Sports Nation, with over 5,000 sporting events in 2006.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show, tip of the day on XM Radio.  Mark from West Virginia writes, I have a 78 Ford F100 with a 302 engine. 
[03:49:00]  Wow, that's quite a relic.  The transmission shifts normally, except it shifts with a hard jerk.  What's causing the hard jerk during shifting?  First off, Mark, a hard jerk when shifting is not normal.  That's abnormal.  Therefore, your trans isn't normal.  This vehicle is equipped with a vacuum modulator valve.  The valve makes for smooth shifting between gears, according to engine demand.  Make sure you have a good source of manifold vacuum to the vacuum modulator on the trans.  Also, you could have a plugged filter inside of the trans.  This would inhibit hydraulic pressure within the unit, resulting in a hard shift. 
[03:49:30]  You may want to try changing the fluid and filtering the trans and use a good quality fluid like Mercon type.  Got a question?  Check our website at americascarshow.com.

And they not only devastate homes and businesses, they destroy hospitals as well. 
[03:51:30]  Sometimes the people who are supposed to help are themselves left in the dark.  Nothing worked.  We had to evacuate via the stairwells.  Patients had to be moved in the priority that those who walk out walked first.  The others had to be hand-carried by people.  Disaster preparedness planners say protecting hospitals is one of their major concerns.  The injured could die if there are no functioning emergency rooms.  We're going to have tens of thousands of injured people, maybe hundreds of thousands of injured people.  We need the hospitals. 
[03:52:00]  They want new hospitals to be constructed like fortresses and existing facilities to be upgraded just in case.

[03:52:30]  Opie and Anthony.  I've been betting a Negro.  This shit's pretty good.  And now, the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And we have hit the streets of New York City.  First half of the Opie and Anthony show is over.  No filter.  Paul has taken his shirt off. 
[03:53:00]  He has his diaper on.  Get away from me.  Look at this.  You walk in front.  No.  Wait, someone just threw a hard blue at him.  You walk in front.  Hold on.  I guess someone has to go in with a microphone.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  Just to set the scene, man.  It takes a lot to freak out New Yorkers.  Yeah, we've been trying.  We had a bagpipe.  Three guys with bagpipes at one point.  We've tried a few things to shake people up.  This might do it.  This might do it.  And you know what?  He keeps begging us to start walking, and we're not going to walk too fast today. 
[03:53:30]  No, it's going to be a slow walk.  We're going to take our time.  He is completely nude, except for a diaper.  And sneakers.  And sneakers.  And we will now make the walk.  And he's getting horrific looks.  It's only 57th Street in Manhattan.  Paul, what's going on?  I need to take a shit.  We can say shit now, right?  Yes, you can say shit now.  Like, fuck, cunt.  Sonny, you're a cunt.  Have you been tanning?  Jesus, when you live in a full-on filter.  Not a hint of his head. 
[03:54:00]  And not a hint that he's ever done a push-up.  Not so fast.  Not so fast.  Slow down.  Slow down.  We want a nice leisurely stroll.  Slow down.  No filter, Paul.  We're going to take our time.  Look at the looks he's getting.  Just keep walking.  And they're spreading away.  Nice and slow.  Look at him.  Only in New York.  He's dividing this place like Moses did the Red Sea.  Was it the Red Sea?  No one wants to get near him.  Oh, this is great.  It takes a lot to get New Yorkers to look, but they are looking today.  People are yawning.  Huh?  Who was that? 
[03:54:30]  She was horrified?  Yeah, people are horrified.  Look at this old codger.  Eccle's eyes just opened up.  Bright-eyed like, holy shit.  He is an abomination.  Look at that body on him.  Come here, Paul.  Paul, come here.  Look at the fucking body on him.  It is a mess.  We've got a few fans out here checking out the walk.  How are you feeling?  Wonderful.  My stomach is going crazy.  Right now, I don't give a shit what I look like.  I just need to get towards the bathroom.  Well, we know that.  You don't give a shit what you look like.  Or I'm shitting in a Steinway.  That's quite obvious.  You didn't give a shit what you looked like four years ago when you started, you fucking 
[03:55:00]  walking mess.  You don't give a shit what you look like.  You got a Bieber.  I want to fuck you.  Hey, Master Poe, how about a few calisthenics with no filter, Paul?  What do you think?  Come here, Paul.  Be a trooper, Paul.  No, no, no.  Master Poe will help you through your...  Here, Master Poe, what do you want him to do?  God, there's so many people checking this out.  He's got camel toe that, like, those fat little girls get at the beach.  Here, what do you want him to do right now? 
[03:55:30]  Let's have him do jumping jacks.  We'll start out with that.  How many do you want him to do?  Let him do 50.  He can't do 50.  Jesus Christ, Paul.  Oh, shit on the pavement, off the fifth.  Oh, shit on the pavement.  Come on.  Okay, after that.  What about running in place?  Run in place.  Run in place.  How about I just run to XM?  Nope.  Miss, what do you think's going on here?  I have no idea.  What do you think of this?  I think it's very peculiar. 
[03:56:00]  What do you mean?  Well, I don't know why he's standing there wearing a diaper.  Can you describe him?  Don't hold back.  It's okay.  He's a little overweight.  Yeah, he's fat.  And you're a little old.  I don't like to use that word.  Yeah, she's being nice.  And I think he could get in shape very easily.  He is in shape.  The shape of a destroyer. 
[03:56:30]  Do you know that he just drank fleet enema?  And something may be pouring out of him any second?  That's why the diaper.  I don't think I want to continue this conversation.  Aw.  Okay, well, have a nice day anyway.  By the way, your mom is so dead.  She's sweet.  She was sweet.  She was sweet.  I'm going to try to get her number.  All right, wait.  Back to doing some exercises with Master Poe.  Come here.  What do you want to do?  Running in place for a few seconds?  Yeah, let's try running in place. 
[03:57:00]  That'll mix everything up in his stomach.  I don't want to do that.  I don't want to mix the stomach up.  Mix it up.  I caught him fat.  Mix it up.  Look at those knees.  I know.  If you could find him.  They're horrified.  He has a bunch of businessmen walking down the street.  Come on, lift him up.  And they're horrified.  Touch my hand.  Touch my partner.  Touch my partner.  Hey, no game.  Just a fraternity hazing.  Nothing to see here.  Just a fraternity hazing.  The world's oldest college student.  One more, one more.  Can I buy you a house? 
[03:57:30]  Pretend that, you know, you're going to the bathroom.  Come on, let's do squats.  Squats.  I don't think I have to pretend I'm going to the bathroom.  Yeah, how about some jumping jacks?  20 jumping jacks and then we'll start walking again.  That's a sexy look.  Last time I did 20 jumping jacks, I think I was 12.  Let's go.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 
[03:58:00]  All right, we'll continue walking.  Yeah, we can walk now.  Yeah, we'll walk a little further.  If you're just tuning in, no filter, Paul.  Walking down the street with us.  By the way, we've made it about 40 feet.  Yeah, about 40 feet.  This whole time.  We want gravy legs.  Gravy legs.  We will accept gravy legs today. 
[03:58:30]  So, look at the people.  I wish I could just describe the number of people and the looks on their faces.  They're terrified.  And they can't stop looking.  They're laughing.  Look at the guy in the van.  The guy in the van just staring in disgust.  All right, Paul.  Come on.  All right, Paul, come here.  We've got another exercise for you.  We're getting a little closer to XM.  It's flashing.  I've got to cross.  No, no, you shouldn't cross. 
[03:59:00]  No, not when it's flashing.  Construction workers cross the way.  We should give them a peek at Paul.  Thanks for the help there, Ben.  Yeah, we'll go across this way.  Let's cross this way with the construction workers.  Okay, come on now.  Cross safely, Paul.  Maybe we could tar and feather him.  Wouldn't want you to get run over.  How embarrassing would it be to have to get picked up in an ambulance wearing a diaper?  The look on that guy's face is priceless.  Look at these workers.  Have a sense of humor.  Oh, Paul wants to help them work. 
[03:59:30]  What do you think of this mess?  This is an asshole.  His body.  Yes, he is an asshole, sir.  He knows that.  He's not even listening.  He knows that.  Everyone knows you're an asshole.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Let's get this on the radio.  What?  What did you say?  In New York, we've got a bunch of assholes.  What the hell?  Yes.  Can we take some of that hot tar and throw it on his back?  No, no, no, no, no.  You're crazy.  All right.  Carry on, guys.  Carry on.  They're filling up potholes and stuff here.  He has more scars than an altar boy. 
[04:00:00]  He's a mess.  Oh, we've got to wait and cross here now.  Well, hold on.  We're going to Starbucks because Rich Voss is doing comedy today as well.  Oh, right.  This is a doubleheader.  This is a doubleheader today.  How are you feeling?  It doesn't feel any different, actually.  Sorry to disappoint you.  Here's our newsstand guy.  He loves us.  Sir, what do you think of this guy?  Oh, he's a handsome guy.  So what's wrong with this guy?  He don't feel cold? 
[04:00:30]  I'm going to shit his pants.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  He drank some of that stuff that makes you shit your pants.  It's a fraternity thing.  I don't know.  Just move along.  Move along, children.  Nothing to see here, kiddies.  You want some gay porn while we're here?  No filter, Paul?  No.  Sonny.  How about a health magazine?  Sonny, pick out a large cock magazine for yourself as a thank you.  Oh, absolutely.  Anything for you, Paul.  A thank you.  The crowd is growing, by the way.  The crowd is growing.  Yeah, they are trying to follow, trying to figure out what is going on, 
[04:01:00]  why this fat mess is in a diaper.  Well, like you said, it's a fraternity hazing.  He's pledging the fraternity.  No, no, no.  Ah, no, forget it.  A lot of people.  Paul, wait.  Hey, Paul, wait to the bus.  Wait to the bus.  Wait to the city bus.  Yeah, jump up and down.  Look at the Asian woman in there is laughing.  Another woman is taking a picture of their cell phone.  They're all picking up their cell phone cameras.  Completely horrified.  And look at the billboard on the side of the bus. 
[04:01:30]  I see black people living, loving, laughing.  It's like they're driving through Great Adventure.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  It's like the animal kingdom.  All the girls at North Fork Bank on the second floor.  Oh, they're all waving out their window.  I think people are starting to figure out that every day we do this walk  because you're seeing more and more people from their windows taking a look.  The dopey guy in the diapers.  All right.  Come on.  Let's go.  Keep going.  We've got to get Rich Voss to do a little comedy at Starbucks,  and then we'll finally head into XM and do the second half of the Opie and Anthony program, okay? 
[04:02:00]  Very good.  Club Soda Kenny, you ready to intro Rich Voss to Starbucks?  Yes, sir.  It's going to be terrific.  Where is the Starbucks?  Right up here.  Basically, what's going to happen, Kenny's going to bust in, get everyone's attention,  and he's going to introduce their next comic, Rich Voss,  and then Rich Voss is going to do a few jokes, and we'll get out of there,  hopefully with no one getting arrested or in trouble, okay?  Hold on.  We've got to talk to the UPS guys.  Oh, and it's a – oh, I'm going to rat them out. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, yeah, okay.  Wait.  Who do you want to talk to?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  No, I got nothing to say, man.  We've got no package of nobody here.  And he has no package, obviously, either.  Rat him out to the black guy.  All right, let's move on.  It was the UPS guys.  They didn't want to be part of this whatsoever.  Yeah, some people don't want to be part of this mess.  A lot of people following, snapping pictures, horrified. 
[04:03:00]  Hey, there's – holy crap, that's FedEx, right?  Hold on.  Let's say hi to FedEx.  He runs OAVirus.com.  You look too – you're all cleaned up.  Got to do something for a living, right?  The new gig?  I drive limos.  You need a ride?  Yeah, we're going to need a ride from that studio to this studio in the near future.  What do you think of no filter, Paul, FedEx?  He looks great. 
[04:03:30]  I love them whiteys.  Fits on you just right.  He's got an ass on him, too, don't he?  Are you getting close to shitting your pants there, Paul?  Actually, no.  No, I don't feel nothing.  I think the cold weather might be keeping him from taking a dump.  Right.  All right.  It's like tightening everything up.  But once we get inside, he's really going to have to crap.  He is in 57th Street now.  Just waving at all the cars.  Waving to people in cabs, in their cars, in traffic.  As he walks down the street wearing nothing but a big, ugly diaper. 
[04:04:00]  Anthony, she wants to know.  Anthony.  She wants to know something.  Yes, we're filming a commercial here for new Depend undergarments.  And it's a wonderful thing that even overweight gentlemen like this can use if he's having incontinence.  I think that you've got the courage of 100 men.  Well, he's got the belly of 100 men.  And his wife has been with 100 men.  And he's got the penis of a baby.  Oh, my goodness. 
[04:04:30]  Okay.  Isn't that a little disappointing?  But as you see, this new diaper fits without any ties on the side.  No Velcro for those embarrassing leaks.  And then turn around.  Look at the back as he chokes Voss.  Come here.  Look at the back.  You can see there's plenty of room just in case he has that other problem with incontinence.  What do you think?  Is this going to sell?  Well, I don't know.  But I think it's good that it's brought to the people's attention.  It should be.  Because incontinence is a big problem.  And I think we're doing, we're helping here is what we're doing. 
[04:05:00]  Will you be buying this brand when you go incontinence?  No comment.  No comment.  She's already incontinent.  By the way, your mama is so dead.  She is already incontinent.  All right.  Blame Andy Warhol for this.  God, this is supposed to be a quick four-minute walkover to the studio.  Yeah, I know.  It's turning into the whole show.  But that's okay.  Because today we've got to do comedy at Starbucks with Rich Voss.  We've got a doubleheader of things to do today.  Wait until the weather gets really nice here in New York and it's not cold, nice and warm. 
[04:05:30]  We will not go back into the studio.  Yeah, we'll just start wandering around.  We'll just wander around Manhattan.  God, how far is Starbucks?  Yeah, we've already passed the studio.  What the hell are we doing?  All right.  We're almost there.  Oh, I know why.  Because we're taking our time walking because we're hoping he's going to crap his pants.  Usually we make this walk a lot faster.  Huh?  If you guys want to do the Starbucks thing next week, it doesn't bother me.  No, no.  We're doing it right now.  Oh, no, Rich.  Oh, no, Rich.  You're not going to get out that easy.  Rich is smoking, by the way, like crazy.  Yeah, he's getting really hard. 
[04:06:00]  He's getting all the cigarettes.  Well, I just don't know what to open with.  What are you open with?  Yeah, what are you going to open with, Rich?  I don't need this stuff.  Here we go.  We're right outside Starbucks.  No, you don't need the earpiece.  And you hand me the mic.  All right, hold on.  Let's set this up professionally.  So, Kenny, listen.  This is what's going to happen.  Don't burst in and scare people.  Don't look like we scared Tony Bennett yesterday.  Just go in there casually.  Yeah.  And then just say, people, may I have your attention?  You know, and then introduce Rich Voss as their next comedian, okay? 
[04:06:30]  I got you.  And then hand over the mic to Rich.  Okay, cool.  All right, here we go.  Anybody want to go in first ahead of us?  Here we go.  Paul, stay out here because we don't want you wrecking the bit.  Someone wants...  No, you can't.  You have to wait until we get back.  You cannot use the bathroom.  All right, here we go.  Club's on Kenny.  You don't want him upstaging you.  All right, here goes Kenny.  Let's see.  Listen in.  Let's see.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Right outside Starbucks.  Walking in.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Coming to the stage, your next comic.  You've seen him on Last Comic Standing. 
[04:07:00]  Let's give him a warm Starbucks welcome for Mr. Rich Voss.  Let him hear it.  Rich Voss, everybody.  How are we doing?  Rich Voss.  Thank you.  It's good to be here.  I'm from Jersey, and we had a gay governor, which is great because he fixed up all the rest areas.  I have two.  How are you guys doing?  Are you from China?  Don't cough near me.  Anyhow, I have two daughters, 15 and 13.  No, hold on.  I'm just doing five minutes.  I got an audition.  Just five minutes.  All right, two minutes. 
[04:07:30]  Two minutes.  Okay, don't film.  No filming.  This is a big set for me right now because if I do well here, I get to work Dunkin' Donuts.  So just let me do two minutes.  That's all I need.  All right, no filming.  Listen, the customers love it.  They got to go to work.  They want to go with a smile.  Look at these two ladies love me.  Stop working the crowd.  I got a car.  I got a car.  All right, here's the thing.  I got two daughters, 15 and 13.  I was divorced when they were really young, and they took it tough because I remember telling them it was their fault. 
[04:08:00]  That's a nice bag, sir.  Did that come with a penis in your mouth?  Thank you.  I think we better wrap this up.  You guys were a great crowd.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Thanks.  They were good.  He did not close with that.  Hey, a wow sticker.  He did not close with that awful joke.  Very nice.  A fan of the show right there.  Or is the cabbie a fan?  The cabbie's a fan.  He's showing a wow sticker.  Well, it is Whip Him Out Wednesday. 
[04:08:30]  That woman that worked in there was horrified.  Why did we wrap this up?  It was going well.  Going well?  You had to go with the penis joke?  Oh, that's right.  Jesus.  Well, I didn't know.  You said work the crowd.  No, I said stop working the crowd and get to your act.  Oh, I thought you said work the crowd.  Every joke you told got nothing.  All right, let's cross the street.  Got nothing.  No, there were some people smiling.  Were they?  All right, we're trying to cross the street here.  I got some good smiles.  You got a smile. 
[04:09:00]  Yeah, that was about it.  Listen, that's just the first time.  We're going to do some other good spots, you know?  All right.  I think the Port Authority bathroom, I think.  Yeah, that was a little rough.  It wasn't.  I felt comfortable.  Hey, we got a pole street.  You want me to do a few minutes on the bus?  Yeah, let's go.  Let me do a few minutes on the bus.  Hey, what's up?  Can I do a couple minutes of comedy?  You guys a fan.  All right, just drive off.  Oh, there's only two people.  Well, that's.  I was going to work the bus.  That's a big crowd for you.  Why is this dude walking around with underwear? 
[04:09:30]  No, that's a diaper, actually.  We're testing.  A diaper?  Oh, how cute.  Did you make a pee-pee or a poo-poo in it?  Wow.  My grandmother is here.  Thank you.  Let me smell.  Wow.  He needs a change in.  Wow.  Mrs. Norton.  She's a real trooper.  Let's get across the street here.  Oh, can we cross?  I don't know.  We'll try.  With any luck, Paul will get splattered in the middle of the street.  Oh, now we're in trouble.  Oh, boy.  Now we're stuck in the middle of 57. 
[04:10:00]  Now we're in the middle of the road.  Oh, yeah.  Master Poe's going to attempt to stop a city bus.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Wham.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  This car's going to run us over.  He ain't stopping for you.  All right.  Here we go.  There we go.  All right.  You know, I'm pissed off you bailed.  It was going well.  Boss, you guys.  I started getting them.  You pulled out the penis joke when you could have closed with that.  Boss, that should have been a closer.  No, it's so funny about that, too. 
[04:10:30]  You sounded so, like, pathetic because, you know, you were on Last Comic Stand, and it sounded  like this is the only work you could get.  I like your Dunkin' Donuts line.  I got some laughs.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, she came running at me, and I'm used to that.  But I wish I had my laser.  She thought by saying no filming that the whole thing was going to end, and then the  camera walked out, and Rich just kept babbling, and she's like, now what do I do to get him  out of here?  Unfortunately, I think that might be our last appearance at Starbucks. 
[04:11:00]  I don't know.  I think it went well.  I closed another room.  Finally heading into...  Oh, no.  Now we've got to deal with building security guy with this fat fuck in diapers.  I'll see you guys later.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  We're in the lobby of our building here.  Yeah.  At XM Satellite Radio.  No filter, Paul.  How's it going?  Well, actually, while Rich was bombing in Starbucks, I bombed in the bathroom.  I actually went, and now I've got to go again.  No, you didn't go.  Yeah, I did.  I told Kenny I couldn't stop. 
[04:11:30]  Didn't you see me run?  Kenny, is that true?  I was distracted when I didn't see him go.  I ran in.  I couldn't stop.  I didn't either.  Nope.  Nope.  Are you kidding me?  You better not have gone.  We needed a grand finale, and you ran into Starbucks?  There will be one.  It's still going.  Trust me.  All right.  Well, the elevator is making our mics crackle, so...  Yeah, we're...  It's now time.  It's time to shut these off.  We'll see them upstairs.  We'll shut them off.  We'll see upstairs.  Just a bit.  It's the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:12:00]  Hi.  It's part two of the Opie and Anthony show, uncensored, on XM Satellite Radio.  I just got upstairs.  I guess Opie had to take the second elevator.  The first one was full.  No filter Paul in his diaper.  No going to the bathroom yet, you hump.  Apparently, he took a partial dump in Starbucks when Voss was doing his act.  Which, uh, I don't think was fair.  I think that was supposed to be saved for the bathroom here, so we could put a mic on it, 
[04:12:30]  but...  I told Kenny, but he was, uh, busy, you know, doing security.  Well, now you're going to have to sit and percolate for a while until you've really got  to go.  It's going to be about a minute or two, because I can feel it.  No, you're going to have to sit and wait.  And I will shit on your studio floor.  I will allow you to go to the bathroom until, uh, until it's going to be a big build-up.  What, does he stink?  What happened, uh, D-Rock?  His breath reeks.  Oh, his breath.  Holy shit, that's a little hypocritical, don't you think?  I thought maybe he was farting or something as you're holding his nose, but it's his breath? 
[04:13:00]  No, I've been belching since I took that stuff.  He's English.  I'm sure you can, uh, smell the last three or four days, uh, and I'm on that fast smash  diet, too, so your breath always stinks when you think about that.  Oh, that's wonderful, because you're fasting or eating fruit or some kind of crap.  I've lost 13 pounds, so I'm pretty happy about that.  13 pounds?  13.  13.  Yes, 13.  Jesus.  Well, that was a really wonderful walk.  I like that, and I know when the weather gets nicer, that stroll is just going to take  about, uh, two hours. 
[04:13:30]  Yeah, it all depends on, uh, you know, what we got, uh, to do.  Yeah.  Let's go to, uh, Steve in South Carolina.  Steve.  Hey, you need to punish no Philip Paul for taking a shit.  Make him drink that other bottle and give him some of the big brand muffins from Starbucks.  Did anyone see him run into the bathroom?  I didn't see that at all, and it was so quick.  He must be punished.  But I was fixated on, uh, Rich and his act.  And, uh, big doofy Club Soda Kenny introing him.  It was a good intro.  Kenny had it down, man. 
[04:14:00]  He had everyone's attention, man.  He's good.  There was a one person in there that wasn't looking at, uh, Kenny.  Yeah.  He's quite beautiful.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  All right.  Uh, let's go to...  Okay, guys.  I gotta take a bathroom run, so...  No, hold on.  No, I ain't got a choice.  Absolutely haven't.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We need, uh, some type of mic or, or something in there.  Well, why would you...  I want to hear this...  Make sure the mic works.  He's got a diaper on.  Why even let him leave the room?  Yeah.  I'll have my underwear.  I'll make a deal with no filter, Paul. 
[04:14:30]  Oh, my God, no.  If you could get past, uh, Club Soda Kenny, the bathroom is yours.  I'm not even gonna fight, Kenny.  I'll try it.  Then you better just stand right there.  He's got quite the defense mechanism, though.  I have my underwear on stuff under here.  Huh?  You can just shit on people.  What?  I have underwear under here.  No.  You're wearing underwear under your diaper.  Well, you're from...  Yeah, I didn't know what...  You're from England.  You're probably dirty anyhow.  I didn't know what was gonna hang out of it when I saw it.  Great.  I got another diaper.  You do?  Well, uh, yeah, if he's gotta go, there's gotta be a mic in there.  Yeah, that's fine.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[04:15:00]  Don't let him leave the studio.  Not yet.  Let it build up a little more.  Yeah, let's just let it build up a little bit.  What is it feeling like?  A lot of pressure?  Feels like I gotta take a shit in like five seconds.  A lot of pressure?  There's no more building up.  I'm just ready to go.  Lock the door.  Come on.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  You have to suffer, sir.  Lock the door.  Kenny, do not let him leave.  No problem.  There you go.  He doesn't leave this studio.  Kenny's the bouncer.  Yeah, you go.  If you can get past Kenny, the bathroom's yours.  I'm not gonna fight Kenny.  I respect him.  I got no problem.  You respect him?  I'm gonna respect him.  He's twice my size. 
[04:15:30]  I'm not gonna fight him.  I respect him.  He would have that same line if there was a midget guard at the door.  Why, boss is gonna fucking guard the door?  I respect that guy Tyson.  I won't fight him.  Fuck Tyson.  He's a Negro.  I don't give respect for him.  Oh, boy.  Stop with the Negro stuff.  Yeah.  Stop.  That's why you get such a bad rap.  It's why people don't like you.  Let's go to Pinchy.  Pinchy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey, man.  Hey, did anyone catch Boss's line on the street about no-filter Paul and his scars?  No.  What did he say?  You want to tell it, Rich?  You want me to?  I don't remember what I said. 
[04:16:00]  He said no-filter Paul has more scars than an altar boy.  Hi, Jared.  I did hear that, actually.  Let's go to Kurt in Pennsylvania.  Kurt, what's up?  Hey, baby Huey there holds that in too long.  His colon might explode like a cartoon cigar.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  I got to go.  I've only got one pair of underwear, and I have a job interview at 5 o'clock.  I can't shit my underwear.  Well, I think between now and 5, you can buy another pair of underwear.  It's not a big deal.  What am I going to do?  Go walk naked to go get them, stupid? 
[04:16:30]  You got pants.  You're white bopping.  You put your jeans on.  Yeah.  You really got to go that bad.  I absolutely have to go, and I don't want to crap in the studio.  You're not going to like the smell, so you want to deal with that?  If you can get past Club Santa County.  I don't want to fight Kenny.  Well, then you sit there.  Let's go to Doug Out Dog.  Doug, what's up?  I think I was going to say I'm giving out wow stickers tonight, but I'm looking at this  video on Pal Talk, and I'm going to fucking vomit.  It's pretty horrific, isn't it?  Holy shit.  Paul's in a diaper.  Anyway, yeah. 
[04:17:00]  Tonight, I'll be at the Funny Bones with Rich Voss, giving out wow stickers if you guys  want to come down.  Tonight and Friday night, I'll be giving out wow stickers with Rich Voss at the Virginia  Beach Funny Bones.  Hey, Paul, don't pay to get in.  I'll take care of you.  Don't, you know.  Doug.  Doug, Doug.  Yeah, Doug.  I can't make my mind off of Paul standing there.  I can't either, Rich.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Doug, you'll have tickets at the door for you, all right?  Don't pay.  Appreciate it.  How are you going to work that out?  I just go.  I'll take care of him when I get down here.  When I get in the town, I'll just say.  You know his last name at all?  Doug Out.  Oh, yeah.  Doug Out's his first name.  I'll just go Doug. 
[04:17:30]  All right.  Doug.  Are you laying down papers on the floor?  Yeah, Sonny Ferrelli's loving this moment.  Sonny, what's up?  Oh, I am absolutely loving this.  This is great.  Look, I really will have a problem doing the show in here if it smells like Paul shit.  I understand that.  But look at the desperation on his face.  It's almost sad.  He's really got to go.  He looks really sad.  What's going on, Paul?  A little gurgling action?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that your normal gut or is it like pushing out? 
[04:18:00]  What's wrong, E-Rock?  He's starting to smell bad.  Wait, what?  You guys want to deal with that?  You knock yourselves out.  Wait, why is it smelling?  You farting?  Because the farts aren't farts.  The shit ready to fire.  Are you shitting yourself?  I'm about to.  You guys want to smell that?  You go ahead.  No.  You won't?  Yes.  I don't smell that.  Yes.  Yes.  When you got that crap in you, sometimes you don't even feel it coming out.  Exactly.  That's what I'm feeling right now.  Anthony, get Anthony a wireless mic and get him outside the studio. 
[04:18:30]  He needs to be in his protective bubble.  That's all right.  Until he takes a dump, I'm okay.  I'm ready to go.  Can I go to the bathroom?  No.  Have someone go with me.  Whatever.  No.  If you can get past Co-Pisoda Kenny in the bathroom.  I'm not going to fight Kenny.  Come on.  Well, then we definitely have a problem.  Something does kind of stink in here.  It's my career.  It's your fucking comedy talent.  Oh, please.  Oh, God.  Alonzo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy's worried about compromising his dignity, about shitting his pants in a studio.  Yeah.  And yet he just walked on 57th Street in a fucking diaper. 
[04:19:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  What an asshole.  Let's go to Johnny in New York.  Johnny, what's up?  Johnny.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Johnny.  I just got a little message for Paul there.  Paul, you stupid motherfucker.  The purpose of wearing a diaper is to go in the fucking diaper, not in the bathroom, you  dumbass.  Oh, is that what you do at home, you douchebag?  No, I don't wear fucking diapers.  So how do you know so much about them, you fucking asshole? 
[04:19:30]  Stupid.  Does your grandmother wear one?  Hey, listen.  Stop fucking up the show.  Take the crap in the diaper like you're supposed to.  That's why you're fucking wearing it, you fucking idiot.  But he put underwear on under the diaper, so now the diaper becomes useless for him.  Exactly.  That was kind of stupid.  Oh, what a fucking showstopper.  How many people are in pal talk right now?  Thanks for wrecking the show, Paul.  I think Paul's great.  Let's go to Ray in South Carolina.  Ray?  Yeah.  You need to make him drink more water.  It's going to make it work better.  Ah, more water, more water, more water, more water, more water. 
[04:20:00]  Get him some water.  He's holding in there.  Is your gut getting bigger?  Yes.  It is, right?  It's gurgling and getting, yeah, stretching out.  It's bloating up a little bit.  Hey, we got a whole thing of Godiva chocolates here.  I can't eat chocolate.  I'm on the Fat Blast diet.  Maybe, uh, oh, don't worry about it.  It'll just come right in.  Nah, I'm following it.  Right now you're on the shit smash diet.  Yeah, exactly.  I want to fuck his belly button.  And he continues to drink more water. 
[04:20:30]  How you feeling, no filter, Paul?  Keep drinking.  No different.  All right.  Well, then you just hang out for a while.  No problem.  I got to eat something before he shits when I can't eat for, like, a month after that.  This place is going to reek.  Let's say hi to Mark in Hillsboro.  Mark, what's up?  He makes a good point, actually, Mark.  Go ahead, Mark.  Paul's got a job interview later.  I took that stuff that he's got to take, and I was on the toilet for, like, 18 hours straight. 
[04:21:00]  He is never making that job interview.  It doesn't matter what he's wearing.  He doesn't have to buy new underwear.  He's going to need to just, like, find a place to lay down.  Yeah, where are you, uh, job interviewing?  Yeah.  I'm going to say that on the air.  Good job.  Well, what kind of work?  What kind of work?  Computer work.  Computer work.  All right.  Let's go to Tony in California.  Tony?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Tony.  Hey, you need to have a little club soda, Kenny.  Go over and squeeze him like a tube of toothpaste.  Ooh. 
[04:21:30]  Punch it out.  All right.  Bear hug.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh!  Oh, man.  Kenny's pumping his stomach.  Can you put the hand lower?  Kenny's pushing his freaking gut in as hard as he can.  Wow, that's got to hurt.  How'd that treat you?  Wonderful.  No different.  I got to shit even away, so whatever.  Why are you holding it in?  I'm going to shit in the studio.  All right.  Well, it's going to be a long morning, then. 
[04:22:00]  Oh.  Let's say hi to Mike in Dallas.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, man, this fucking idiot here is fucking taking a shit in his diaper, but yet he lets  his wife blow anything that resembles a shadow.  Fucking idiot.  You fucking bag of fucking arthritic bones.  Asshole.  People don't like you.  Why is that?  Because he's a little cocky.  A little cocky.  A little cocky.  A little doody. 
[04:22:30]  A little doody.  Well, we're waiting.  Oh, no.  He almost looks...  He's got a look on his face like he's ready to.  Wait, Danny, what's going on back there?  They're miking his ass, I think, which is the funniest thing ever.  Danny's in charge of miking his ass.  Yeah, thanks.  It just smells like absolute horseshit.  Are you sneaking some farts out, hoping that there's no sneaking? 
[04:23:00]  They're sneaking themselves out.  And there's...  And it's just farts at this point?  No.  E-Rock, what's wrong?  Dude, this is awful.  I mean, this is going to start tearing your eyes in a few minutes.  Are you crapping yourself, you think?  Do you think stuff's coming out into your underwear?  He's got the look of a baby that's shitting himself.  You know how the baby makes that?  Yeah.  There's got to be some bowel spray with that.  Yeah?  You think he's been spraying his underwear?  Yeah.  Why?  I can't smell a bag.  Someone pull back and take a look.  Kenny just gave him a good wedgie. 
[04:23:30]  Kenny.  Oh, Voss is puking.  Are you puking?  Voss gets really queasy with stuff like this, and he'll start gagging.  Yeah.  Oh, no, bear hug.  Lift him up, lift him up, lift him up.  Oh, no, lift him up.  Lift him up, Kenny.  Kenny's getting...  Oh, he's lifting him up by the gut.  Kenny's giving him the Heimlich, lifting him up. 
[04:24:00]  Nathaniel, what's up?  You got anything?  You're just coming in?  No homo.  No homo.  Yeah, by the way, Kenny, no homo.  That looked like Oz.  No homo.  That was medicinal.  Oswald from Georgia.  Oswald.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, man.  I'm going to take no filter Paul's side here.  Yeah.  And Paul, I'm telling you, man, hit some balls, drop that diaper, go right next to Opie, and  just shit all over the floor. 
[04:24:30]  Projectile shit.  Is Bobby here today?  Maybe he can play, did you shit your pants?  Right.  He could slide his hand on your feet and feel for a load.  We got to go to Colorado.  It's Melanie.  Melanie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know it ain't that bad if he hasn't started to sweat yet.  Are you sweating, Paul?  Any sweat under that hair?  No, I don't really.  Is there some gurgling going on?  Absolutely.  All right.  Why don't you drink some more water?  No pain in the legs? 
[04:25:00]  Completely full of water.  Huh?  You could drink a little more.  I've been sipping a bit more.  This is so great.  A little more.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe in Chicago.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, boys.  What's going on this morning?  Well, we're waiting for Paul to do what he has to do.  Yeah, I was going to say, if Paul doesn't shit in the studio, he needs to shave his Lego  hair off.  It's annoying.  Paul, you suck.  Dude, get a fucking original joke, you douchebag.  What the fuck?  Hey, Paul.  Die.  Get out, boys. 
[04:25:30]  They just don't like him.  He gets under your skin.  He's unlikable for some reason.  What's going on, Paul?  Nothing.  Sonny Ferelli?  Anything?  I'm starting to smell him now, but I have another bottle of phospho soda if we need it.  You want to drink a little more?  No, I'm already at the prescription dosage.  Thank you.  All right.  Paul, are you going to put this video on your website?  Well, I guess I'll have to, won't I? 
[04:26:00]  Oh, my balls.  Oh, God.  Okay, terrific.  Well, we're at a standstill, aren't we?  Yeah.  We're at a standstill right here.  He's eyeing that butt plug on the table, thinking that could block it up. 
[04:26:30]  That'll take someone's eye out when this thing goes off.  Why don't you just get it over with?  When you went into the Starbucks, did it fly out?  What was it like?  Did it fly out?  No, it's just like the start.  You know, like, when you have, the shits are coming, and you have some solid and some liquid?  Yeah.  That's what it was like.  Yeah.  Oh.  Paul, you have to finish the bit here.  You have to.  Yeah.  See, Sonny knows.  Yeah.  What does Sonny know?  He didn't fucking complete shit. 
[04:27:00]  He got the bottle into your mouth, dummy.  Yeah, he brought a great bit to the show today.  Are you kidding me?  How about he completes it outside the glass window with a microphone?  I don't want it in this studio.  Oh, my God.  Do I not want him shitting himself in this studio?  Do you know how long?  I got the extra absorbent diapers.  It doesn't absorb the smell.  This is like a hostage negotiation.  We got to make some kind of deal with Paul. 
[04:27:30]  Deal or no deal.  Deal or no deal.  No deal.  Shit or no shit.  We could just ban you from the show if you don't do it.  Oh, here we go.  But you want him to shit his pants right now, his diaper?  Yeah, that's the whole excitement, to see a grown man shit himself.  Of course.  Why do you think I'm almost going to miss my plane?  I'm waiting here to see this fucking jackass shit himself.  Of course. 
[04:28:00]  It's the only way this ends.  Wow.  This is the only way it ends.  Anybody can go to the bathroom and shit.  Yeah.  And then you hear a couple noises in the background.  Who cares?  You let him shit himself, you dress him, and you throw him out of the place.  You don't even let him in the bathroom to clean up.  Get out, you smelly Englishman.  You're used to the stink anyhow going home.  All right, Paul, well, just shit yourself, and then, you know, you're free to go.  Seems to be it.  How the fuck do you make that decision? 
[04:28:30]  You're disappointing all your fans.  Oh, yeah.  Are you capable?  Would you be able to, right now, physically able to just let that fly out of you and shit  yourself?  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Without a problem?  Well, not out of choice, but yeah.  So, Voss is puking.  See, he can't take it either, but he understands this is how it has to go.  Okay, there's a garbage pail, Rich, just in case you've got to puke. 
[04:29:00]  There's only one ending to this thing.  All right, I'm a team player.  I won't complain.  I'll complain after it's done, but I won't put a stop to it or anything.  Okay, so any time you want to just open up your bunghole and let the shit fly out.  Let's get this really clear.  I shit my pants.  I can go to the bathroom.  I say you take off the diaper and shit into the fucking bucket right here.  Just let it spray into this bucket right here.  What's the big deal?  Is that like some porn fantasy for you?  No.  Listen, you know it's going to just pour down his legs. 
[04:29:30]  It's going to pour down his legs.  Well, we got him on newspaper.  Yeah, he's on newspaper.  Yeah.  Anything?  What do you say, Paul?  You didn't answer my question.  What?  If I do that, I can just go to the bathroom and do whatever I got to do.  Yeah, it's got to be obvious, though.  I'll shit in the garbage can if you want.  No, no, no.  We just need some kind of confirmation that you actually shit your diaper.  Bring in Bill.  Yeah.  Bill will look.  Bill can lay under me. 
[04:30:00]  Bill will look when he's done.  Bill will look like a proud parent.  Do you think it'll come out like an avalanche, or will you be able to actually just put  a little out and then, like, seal back up?  I can't decide that.  You know how it is?  It'll either do a little bit or it'll just no stopping.  Yeah.  Once you open.  Hey, Bill.  It's over.  That's over.  Does it stink back there, Bill?  No, I don't smell anything.  No, you don't smell anything yet?  Can you get back there?  You don't have to get too close.  Just close enough.  To what? 
[04:30:30]  Just to see.  Like, just his rear end.  You don't have to sniff his butt.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Without a price.  Will you be the one, Bill, that at least takes a peek to make sure he did it?  Do I have to touch him?  No.  No, no.  You just have to open the diaper a little.  But that means someone else, if he can.  If someone else can pull the diaper back, or if he can.  Kenny, can you pull the diaper back?  Actually, I don't think we're going to have to.  There's going to be a brown spot for the diaper.  No shit.  Well, what about, but he's got underwear on.  I've got my underwear on.  It's got to get through his eyes.  It's going to smush all over the back of his ass. 
[04:31:00]  But it'll be so liquidy, maybe.  Yeah, this is really disgusting.  All right, Paul.  Yes, sir.  The Pal Talk camera's on.  Should we?  Yeah, great.  Stare at the camera and do what you have to do.  All right.  Let her rip, and then you can go and clean up.  Move a little closer.  No.  You want a front or back shot?  Let me pull your finger.  Let me pull your finger.  Right here.  Wait, wait.  We want.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  We want him to stare.  Get the camera right.  We want him to stare right into the camera and do what you've got to do. 
[04:31:30]  Uh-oh.  Ben.  Uh-oh.  Wait, Ben.  Squat like this.  Yeah, but then it's going to come out over your fucking floor, because that's what it's  going to be.  No, we don't.  That's what's going to happen.  It's liquid.  It's not going to stay in the underwear.  Move up the camera a little bit.  That's what we need.  I'm going to do it.  All right.  I'm warning you because of your floor.  Paul, talk to the power talk camera.  It's right in front of you.  Whatever.  Give him the look and do it.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  They want back shot.  They want a back shot.  They want back shot?  They don't want front shot. 
[04:32:00]  They want a back shot.  Oh!  It's not stopping!  Turn around.  Turn around to the camera.  Turn around to the camera.  It's not stopping!  Oh, it's driven down his leg.  It's driven down his leg.  Oh, his diaper's filling up.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! 
[04:32:30]  Sonny Ferrelli always wins in the end.  Oh, my God!  It's green!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Holy shit!  Oh, no!  That was disgusting!  Holy shit!  That was disgusting!  Ah!  Wait!  Don't move!  Don't move!  We got to cover you up!  You should have to go to the bathroom, yeah! 
[04:33:00]  All right, but don't move!  We don't want you, like, freaking...  Holy shit!  Oh, gravy leg!  Oh, my God!  Oh, no!  Holy crap!  Holy crap!  Did you hear it?  Holy crap!  Did you hear it right when you let loose?  Just get yourself.  Oh, my God!  Don't move!  Don't move!  Don't move!  Don't move!  Stay on the paper!  Look at...  He's old gravy!  Don't move!  Don't move!  Because they're going to get...  They're going to get really pissed at us.  Don't move! 
[04:33:30]  I need something to put...  Now you've got to play ball with us.  Do not move, because they're going to get really pissed.  Yeah, we understand that.  I give him a plastic garbage bag and cover himself with that.  Oh, my God!  And that's your fucking fault!  Oh, my God!  Make Sonny smell my ass after the shit he did!  It's not your ass!  People are calling him Old P-Soup Leg.  His ass is like the girl from The Exorcist.  Oh, my God!  And when it went, it just wouldn't...  It wouldn't fucking...  Holy... 
[04:34:00]  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  You guys are back being friends, or what?  No, now I have to get my own back on that cut.  That is so disgusting.  We'll try to describe it for...  Well, the people at PalTalk saw it.  Oh, my God!  Yeah, they saw the whole thing on PalTalk.  He just let loose.  He exploded.  Yeah, what actually happened was, is I tried to get a little bit out, and it was just like  fucking Niagara Falls.  It just wouldn't...  When you guys were laughing, it was still going. 
[04:34:30]  Oh, we saw it.  We saw it immediately.  I heard it at first, and then I just saw it dripping down his leg, and then it just came  out from everywhere.  Holy mo...  And it landed on the newspaper, green.  All right, they're getting some bags for you.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, some of the PalTalk girls look like they're going to puke.  All right, get in the bag.  Okay, you're going to...  Get in the bag.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, get in the bag. 
[04:35:00]  Get in the bag.  Can we just put him in the bag, twist tie the top, and throw him away?  One, two.  See?  There you go.  People are definitely enjoying this on PalTalk today.  It's an old gravy bag.  It's going to just drop it down his leg.  Oh, my God.  There are girls on PalTalk that, I swear, are going to puke.  I thought we were just trying to get you in the bathroom.  Get the bag...  Yeah, so he can clean up in the bathroom.  Just get in the bag.  That's a fucking hole.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wow, wow, wow.  Someone get the PalTalk camera. 
[04:35:30]  I know that, Iraq, this is going to be rough.  And really get a close-up of what's on that newspaper.  Oh, you really want to do that?  Yeah, because the PalTalk people...  All right, hold on.  Move it up a little.  All right, I'm good.  Right there, right there.  Felt up.  Right there.  Oh, God.  Felt up a little more.  Oh, my God.  It's green.  It is green.  That is actually because...  Don't touch, Jerry.  No, my hands are fine.  That's because of the fruit and veg for the first nine days.  The first nine days of the Fat Smash Tire. 
[04:36:00]  Holy shit.  All right.  Look at that.  It actually looks like England.  Very good.  I never saw so many people leave their PalTalk cameras.  Yeah, we're down to seven years.  Oh, my God.  They just left their cameras.  Silly Goose is gagging.  Baby Girl walked away, and she was red and almost puking. 
[04:36:30]  Green apple splatters.  That's right.  That's right.  Holy.  I got to tell you, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  It hurt.  It really, really started hurting.  I didn't want to laugh anymore.  That was the money shot.  Besides that, the funny part is you two screaming.  Because usually you've got to describe stuff.  You didn't have to describe because everyone reacted exactly at the same time.  Him with his shirt over here with his shirt over there.  Does that really help? 
[04:37:00]  I can't smell anything yet.  I know the second I pull the top of the shirt down off of my mouth, I'm going to smell it.  Wow.  God.  Want some egg sandwich?  Yeah, get him to the bathroom.  It's like he had green eggs.  Get him to the bathroom.  Let's go to Tim in Cleveland.  Tim, what's up?  I've been with you guys since day one on satellite.  I listened to you for two years before you went off on your little break. 
[04:37:30]  This is the first fucking time I ever had to turn the radio off.  Oh, my God.  It's cringe.  All right.  It's cringe right at its finest.  Oh, my God.  I tried to take the shirt off of my mouth and nose.  No, it's not going to work.  It smells like shit in here.  Let's go to Jerry in Pennsylvania.  Shit in here.  Jerry.  Hey, boys.  You're killing me.  Why?  I'm driving to a job right now.  I'm driving through Lancaster County in Pennsylvania, the heart of dairy country, and all I've smelled 
[04:38:00]  for the last 45 minutes is manure.  Yeah.  And the shit talk and the manure, you're killing me.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Dave in Massachusetts.  Dave.  I just tore open a Godiva coffee bag.  I'm holding it up to my nose.  He's going to be doing this the whole rest of the show.  So, yeah, it just, it has begun for him.  Brad in Michigan.  Brad.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Brad. 
[04:38:30]  Hey, boys.  Can you have balls shake back and forth and yell, holy shit, wahoo?  Very nice.  Let's go to Zach in West Virginia.  Zach.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I got to say, I didn't think that the wasp nest to the ball bag could be top of a lot  guys, but God damn, radio gold here.  Radio gold.  That was, no, that was radio green.  Radio, radio emerald.  Radio bad gold because it turned green.  Start it out, boys.  All right.  Yeah. 
[04:39:00]  Radio fake gold.  Yeah, radio whatever.  That was horrific.  It was.  That was probably the worst thing I've ever seen in radio.  So, Derek, can you back it up?  I got to hear the reaction because it just happened and we all just lost our minds.  Just back it up like a few, you know, about 10, 15 seconds before.  I heard something right before it happened.  Like I heard like a, like some kind of sound when he unleashed and then it was just total  shock and disgust and awe. 
[04:39:30]  Right.  I've ripped open a bag of the Godiva coffee and I'm holding that under my nose now.  Remember, he took this like a little over an hour ago and he was like so cocky.  I got nothing to make.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what he went.  Oh, you poor fucking intern.  I feel so.  You poor fucking interns.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  That's Bill.  Good old Bill.  All right.  You guys want to hear it again?  Bill and Childstar who, uh, oh my God. 
[04:40:00]  You're not happy.  They are really having a hard time.  Look.  They almost got it up perfectly.  Childstar's wincing.  Oh.  And it's in the garbage.  They're wearing their protective gloves.  Childstar just ran from the room now.  He's trying to hold his breath the whole time.  All right.  He's gagging and coughing.  Did you see Ben pull down the curtains and shut the door in the office?  Holy shit, look.  Look at our office.  Ben is hibernating. 
[04:40:30]  Ben wants no part of stuff like this ever.  Ben's like a turtle going into his shell.  Yeah.  Wow.  Was that bad.  Paul, did you, uh, relieve yourself more in the bathroom?  Uh, yeah, a little bit.  A little bit, okay.  Hey, you want to hear it again before Rich?  You got to leave soon, huh, Rich?  I'm leaving.  Oh, I want to hear this again, yeah.  Yeah, I want to hear it, though, kind of.  All right, hold on a minute.  This is what happened only, uh, moments ago.  Derek?  Whatever.  Give him the look and do it.  Are you sure?  Yeah, I'm sure. 
[04:41:00]  They want back shot.  They want a back shot.  They want back shot?  They don't want front shot.  They want a back shot.  Oh!  Stop stopping!  Turn around.  Turn around to the camera.  Turn around to the camera.  Oh, it's driven down his leg.  It's driven down his leg.  Oh, his diaper's filling up.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Wow! 
[04:41:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Sonny Ferrelli always wins in the end.  Oh, my God!  Wow.  Oh, wow.  The best and the worst of Opie and Anthony.

[04:45:00]  If so, think twice before plugging it in.  Hi, I'm Dave Graveline.  This is Into Tomorrow.  Once again, flat-screen HDTVs were among the top gifts this holiday season.  If you want to protect that investment and enjoy the beauty of HD for years to come,  then I'd think twice before just plugging it in.  I'm talking about surge protection.  Basic surge protector power strips are cheap and everywhere,  but trust me, those are not what you want to plug this investment into.  The surge protection that they offer is often unreliable.  Go for a power filter from companies like Zero Surge. 
[04:45:30]  Their technology is 180 degrees from surge protectors that you'll find everywhere,  and they offer 100% surge protection.  Check this one out at zerosurge.com.  Plugging you into tomorrow and inviting you to swing by our website for more high-tech tips.  Oh, and your chance to win some great prizes, too, at Graveline.com.  I'm Dave Graveline.  And now, back to the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:46:00]  No, I was just handed a note.  What's the note, Opie?  Oh, this just in.  Danny, very pissed at Pete's Pulp Fiction Pat Battle thing.  Uh-oh, why?  Well, because Travis, Than, and Danny came up with their own Pat Battle Pulp Fiction remix.  Oh, no.  Well, let's see.  Look how pissed Danny is. 
[04:46:30]  You can see it in his face.  God damn.  Danny?  What happened?  Woo-hoo, tell him, Fred.  I don't know.  Me, Nathaniel, and Travis, we were just going off after the show one day with some Pat Battle  lines, and we thought it would be funny to do some.  And it looks like someone beat us to the punch.  Wow.  Tell him, Fred.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  You guys, you came up with one?  With a bunch, yeah, Jimmy.  Can we hear it?  Yeah, they're very, they feel very confident, by the way. 
[04:47:00]  All right, let's hear it.  They handed this disc in proudly this morning, like, you might want to listen to this before  the show.  If you like good radio.  Yeah, right.  They pretty much want to say, we guarantee this is radio gold.  Are you ready to chuckle?  You like to laugh, sit down, enjoy.  Anyway, so the boys, Than, Danny, and Travis came up with the Pat Battle Pulp Fiction Remix.  There's like eight of them here, right?  Yep.  Right?  You ain't got no problem, Jules.  I'm on the motherfucker. 
[04:47:30]  Go back in there and chill them niggas out.  And wait for the-  Pat Battle.  We should be coming directly.  You send in Pat Battle?  You feel better, motherfucker?  Didn't quite have that baritone, uh, that baritone sound of Marshall Swatska.  It's a bad voiceover.  Night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.  I just drank a sea.  That's Pat Battle. 
[04:48:00]  Fucking what you think.  Fuck Pat Battle.  All right, hey, gotta give it to the boys.  That's good.  That one was very good.  You know what's on my mind right now?  It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.  It's the-  Pat Battle.  In my garage.  Oh, Jimmy, don't even worry about it.  Well, no, no, no, no.  Let me not think about anything.  I'm going to ask you a question.  When you came pulling in here, did you notice a sign on the front of my house that said-  Pat Battle.  Storage.  Jimmy, you knew I ain't see no shit.  Did you notice a sign in the front of my house that said- 
[04:48:30]  Pat Battle.  Storage.  No.  I didn't.  You know why you didn't see that sign?  Why?  Because it ain't there, because soaring Pat Battle ain't my fucking business.  That's why.  Now-  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo.  Somebody else did do that one, but in fairness, if you've seen the movie, we know how you came  up with that connection.  Right.  Two words to anything at all. 
[04:49:00]  I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.  Maybe we should have sat in the Pat Battle section.  Which one is-  Two Pat Battles.  No, it's not.  That is-  Pat Battle.  That is Sue Simmons.  I don't see-  Brenda Blackman.  She must have night off some.  Wow.  Very good.  Three local anchors that happen to share the same shade.  That is funny. 
[04:49:30]  Royale with cheese.  You know why they call it that?  Because of the metric system?  Check out the big brain on Pat Battle.  You're a smart motherfucker.  That's right.  And you will know my name is Pat Battle, where I lay my vengeance upon thee. 
[04:50:00]  Yeah, and I bet you $10,000 he lasts his ass off.  I don't give a damn if he does.  Pat Battle.  What do you make of all this?  Man, I don't even have an opinion.  Well, you gotta have an opinion.  I mean, do you think that God came down from heaven and stopped-  What the fuck's happening there?  Oh, shit, man.  Man, I shot Pat Battle in the face.  Why the fuck did you do that? 
[04:50:30]  And finally-  Don't you hurt him!  Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.  We're all gonna be like-  Pat Battles.  And what's Pat Battle like?  Come on, Yolanda, what's Pat Battle like?  What?  Cool.  Correctamundo.  And that's what we're gonna be.  We're gonna be cool.  Excellent job.  Very funny.  Bravo to the boys.  Danny, Than, and Travis.  Good job.  Excellent.  Very good job.  Thank you.  It's the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:51:00]  Oh, no.  Lady Di.  We'll make it fast.  Lady Di.  Hey, how you doing?  How are ya?  Hey, drunk.  Okay, how's everything?  Lady Di.  Marion was in the other day.  Let's do a quick recap.  Lady Di used to be on our show.  She was part of the retarded Laverne and Shirley, we called them.  Childhood friends.  Lady Di.  And Marion, shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  So, uh, Marion is married and doing fine.  Has been for years.  Lady Di.  Lost her job.  Uh, got, became a drunk. 
[04:51:30]  Became homeless.  Lost her, uh, young teenage son.  Uh, where, where he now has to stay with her father.  Because she's an incompetent mother.  Then ended up homeless.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.  Shut up.  You did.  Okay, go ahead.  But anyway, go ahead.  Ended up sleeping and giving blowjobs at the train station.  No, no, no, no, no.  In some train station in Jersey.  No.  While you were homeless.  Two other homeless guys.  Uh, welcome to the show.  I have a thing.  Wait a minute. 
[04:52:00]  So she's homeless blowing other, blowing homeless.  Yeah.  We're not just like a lot.  Blowjobs are supposed to get you up the ladder.  You don't blow other homeless people.  She's blowing her way down.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Well, blow me down.  That's what I meant.  I always wonder what pop I meant by that.  Don't talk about that.  Oh, my goodness.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Yeah.  Right.  Look at the way Homer's getting around like that.  Homeless sploots.  You know?  Disgusting.  Come on.  So what's the update?  Yeah, what's, uh, came in and said, you're not homeless anymore. 
[04:52:30]  Right.  I'm not homeless anymore.  Where do you live?  Do you still blow homeless guys?  I still live.  I still live.  I still live.  I still live.  I still live.  Yeah.  She's just, she's the whole time now.  Yeah.  She gets nostalgic.  Can I suck your cock?  For old times sake.  Sorry, Sal.  Can't do it.  I miss the smell of rotted flesh and metallic tinge.  Oh, shit.  Imagining, of course.  Hi, George.  Oh, stop saying hi to people.  All right, just get on with it.  Listen, we want to know, what happened?  You're on the clock.  You don't have much time today. 
[04:53:00]  Okay, I don't have much time today.  I just called you up a little, just about two minutes ago.  Hey, idiot.  Listen to us.  Now you have less time.  You're on the clock. </pre>
