<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a new show intro phrase, "Ready to roll," sparking banter about catchphrases and merchandise.  This transitioned into a critique of the five-day work week and the prevalence of "busy work." Opie shared his frustration with a coworker, Mars, who constantly mentioned Howard Stern's absences.  The conversation then veered into a discussion about the word "bro," which Opie dislikes.

Guest Sam Roberts joined, recounting a disastrous interview with Cal Ripken Jr. stemming from a question about a rumor involving Ripken and Kevin Costner.  The rumor's various, increasingly bizarre iterations were discussed, alongside Sam's interview techniques and his upcoming sports show.  Listener feedback on the show's intro and a recent Cleveland appearance followed, with Opie expressing annoyance at negative Twitter comments.  A news story about a Cleveland bridge bombing led to a meandering discussion of viral images, including pictures of Wayne Gretzky's daughter, the politicization of the Osama bin Laden anniversary, Obama and Romney's personalities, and Jon Stewart's evolving comedic style. The segment concluded with anxieties about air travel and an anecdote from Opie about a show on air disasters. The entire segment was peppered with vulgar language and off-color humor.

The show continued with a discussion about bad breath and the inadequacy of teeth, followed by a humorous recounting of a news story about a Polish dentist who extracted her ex-boyfriend's teeth.  The hosts then delved into the "THO" (or "DOUGH") Twitter trend, analyzing numerous examples of its often nonsensical usage.  Caller Brian mentioned a similar Instagram hashtag, "BSGD" (Booty Smell Good Dope). Comedian Tom Papa joined briefly.  The conversation shifted to the obsolescence of certain professions, the value of education in the digital age, and a debate on the usefulness of higher education versus vocational training.  Caller Anna, a fifth and sixth-grade teacher, offered her perspective on technology's impact on learning.  The hosts and callers reminisced about past experiences accessing pornography, comparing the challenges of obtaining it in print versus online, with anecdotes involving stolen magazine pictures. The "THO" and "DOUGH" trend was revisited at the end of this segment.

A nostalgic discussion about early pornography viewed on Cinema 100, focusing on films like "Fairy Tales" and "Cinderella," dominated the next segment.  This led to anecdotes about the Rocky Horror Picture Show, its shadow cast, and humorous commentary on their headshots.  A lengthy, graphic exploration of internet pornography searches followed, focusing on identifying a pornographic actress (initially thought to be Vanessa Del Rio, later identified as Kitten Navarro), contrasting older softcore pornography with contemporary, more aggressive content.  The humor of Benny Hill was compared to Monty Python's. Tom Papa was a guest in the studio, promoting his new CD.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used Google searches to look up the pornographic actress, the Rocky Horror cast, and information about the Cramps band.

The final segment focused on the challenges of socializing without cell phones in the hostsâ€™ youth, recounting elaborate schemes to meet friends and including sexually explicit reminiscences about teenage encounters. The impact of technology on social interaction was discussed, contrasting pre-cell phone "detective work" with the ease and anonymity of modern communication.  A darkly comedic discussion of aging celebrities, specifically their appearances in adult diaper commercials, followed.  Several celebrities (Jamie Lee Curtis, Sally Field, Kelly LeBrock, and Lisa Rinna) were mentioned, with graphic descriptions of their aging bodies.  The segment concluded with promotional mentions of upcoming events and a preview of the after-show, including a call from Taylor Hicks and a promise of controversial content. Tom Papa remained in the studio throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Put enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Welcome aboard.  I actually got a...  Yes, Anthony.  I got a...  Now we can roll. Now we can roll.  Really?  Yeah, when I walked in, like, before I got here, we couldn't roll.  But when I walked in, he was like,  Good morning. Now we can roll. Now we can roll.  You know what's happening?  We created a monster.  Or you did, because you brought it to our attention. 
[00:00:30]  He's a monster.  He's the guy that greets us every morning.  Literally, the elevator door opens before we're in the facility,  and he's on guard with greeting.  And it picked up on the fact that he goes,  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  So he put him in the intro.  And now I think he feels like,  Oh, fuck, the pressure's on.  I need another catchphrase.  I need new catchphrases.  Ready to roll.  Ready to roll's the new one?  Ready to roll.  Ready to roll.  Yeah.  See, I'm behind you, because now he's giving me the good morning, good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, you're getting good morning, good morning.  He's testing out the new stuff on me.  Because he knows you're the guy.  He's playing the hits for you.  Yeah, you're the guy that brought it to everyone's attention.  So he's like, Oh, I've got to impress him with a new one.  Yeah, Mom.  What is it again?  We're ready to roll?  Now we're ready to roll.  Now we're ready to roll.  Fuck, I'll be pissed if one of his catchphrases gets on a t-shirt before one of mine.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's true.  He could.  He could.  Good morning.  People would buy good morning, good morning, t-shirts.  Good morning, good morning.  With his face on there.  Good morning, good morning.  I'd buy it. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, fuck.  Weren't we just here?  I believe we were just here.  Holy shit.  Do people feel that way at their jobs?  Probably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I feel guilty that I bitch.  I really do.  Oh, it's crazy that we bitch at all.  But we were just here.  Yeah.  Do people, when they go into their jobs, go, fuck, I was just here.  Yeah.  It would be nice to mix it up, like, all of a sudden tomorrow we show up at, like, three.  Right.  And then, you know, the next day we show up at noon. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Like, shit like that would be like, oh, yeah, now it doesn't feel like I was just here.  But it's that early morning thing, same drive, same everything.  Well, here's the problem.  I'm going to speak for everyone.  Everyone!  Everyone.  Uh, the Monday through Friday thing made a lot of sense for many, many, many, many,  many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many years.  Quite a few years there.  Let's, uh, you know, the entire time we were growing up, Monday through Friday made a shitload  of sense.  That was before phones and computers and everything else. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  You really had to get to the office to get to that file.  I gotta go to the office.  The Johnson file.  Uh, it's been, uh, it's been very obvious for many years that you just don't need to  do that anymore for most jobs.  Yeah.  But you got greedy motherfucking companies and greedy motherfucking bosses that just  can't wrap their minds around giving their employees a break and going, you know what?  Yeah.  That guy could do his job Monday through Thursday.  No problem.  Sure.  They don't, they just can't see it that way. 
[00:03:00]  No, it's that, uh, it's, it's an outline of what work should be.  And it's been that way for years.  Right.  They feel like, all right, if we're going to pay you this much, we're going to have to  make you suffer Monday through Friday.  Even though in their heads, they know that Monday through Thursday, that guy could get  his job done and probably would do a better job.  Yeah.  Cause he'd be a little more rested and a little, a little, a little, uh, a bit of a pep in his  step, but we're not heading toward the Monday through Thursday anytime soon.  Even though it's so obvious. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Most people could do their jobs from home now.  A lot of people.  The white collar people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With the phones and the computers.  You get the same shit at your house that you have at your office.  Right.  So there's really no reason to go into the office unless you're, you know, even, even,  uh, meetings, you could have video conferencing.  Right.  And do it that way.  But I, I believe most people, if you're working at home are really going to slack the fuck  off.  I know me personally.  Yeah.  I wouldn't do shit.  Yeah.  With that said, and you're right, a lot of, a lot of people go to work and they, you 
[00:04:00]  know, they're like, Oh God, I, I already did my job for the day, but I got to make believe  I'm busy.  Yeah.  Now you got to fire me thinking that I'm useless around here.  Do busy work.  I mean, fuck man, you know, we do, we do most of our jobs on the phone every day.  It's the greatest thing.  Quick little text messages, a little email.  Oh yeah.  Download this file.  Cause maybe we want to play it on the air.  Oh, this new story.  Let me fucking save it.  Bah, bah, bah.  Yeah.  The whole rest of the day is pretty much what can we get for the show?  Right.  So you look at things. 
[00:04:30]  That's our job is to look at things.  But I feel other people are doing that with their jobs as well, but then they have to,  they have to go to work, uh, that extra day.  I really believe man, this country could run better on a four day work week.  So you're thinking Friday, Saturday, Sunday, weekends.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Without even blinking.  That would be easy.  I bet when you add it all up though, it's like a huge, uh, a huge hit to our economy.  If you did that, you'd be like, well, yes, but we would lose $18 trillion a day.  Wouldn't those guys be, uh, consuming on Fridays though? 
[00:05:00]  Probably.  Yeah.  You'd be out and about.  Ryan.  Yeah.  Overextending yourself.  Find that boat because now it's three day weekend.  Yeah.  Losing it because you can't afford it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I got a slight issue with Mars.  Mars?  Mars thinks Howard.  I've seen Mars in a while.  Mars thinks Howard Stern is my boy.  He goes, Hey, you see your boy is off again.  I'm like, will you stop? 
[00:05:30]  People know that it irritates the fuck out of me.  He just wants, he just wants to get a rise out of me.  He goes, Hey, Oh, you know, your boy's off again.  I'm like, I know.  And it drives me fucking nuts.  Yes.  It drives me fucking nuts that this guy works part time and makes, I don't know, a billion  fucking dollars from this company.  But yes, it fucking infuriates me, but I don't need Mars reminding me every day.  Mars.  Why does Mars want you yelling about Howard on the air?  He just like, I don't know if he's, he feels like that's the way to become friends with 
[00:06:00]  me or something.  Oh, that's right.  It is the constant search for friendship.  Yeah.  We're all aware that Howard doesn't have to work and he makes a shitload of money and  the company for some reason accepted that a long time ago.  But I don't need Mars going, Hey, I just want to let you know your boy, your boy, he's  not my boy.  No.  And you can't be friends with somebody based on negativity.  Like, Oh, I just bring up what bothers them.  Yeah.  No kidding.  And then they'll see, I know about them.  I'm working on my hang out with me. 
[00:06:30]  Is he a bro?  Is he a bro?  That's not growing down.  No, that's not growing down.  That had me laughing even at home yesterday when it just popped into my head, like growing  down.  When you call another guy, bro in any way, it's, it's so next to gay.  I used to think that, but then Troy, I never had any bros, but Troy and me definitely became  bros.  You're bros now.  Once I started working here.  Yeah, bro.  But the term bro is, bro is so bad, man.  It is the only term for it.  It's a bro. 
[00:07:00]  It's definitely a bro man situation.  Yo, bro.  Like we bro down hard yesterday in the office.  You did.  After the show.  Oh, after the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that?  You sucked each other's dicks?  No.  We just bro down.  I don't like that, Sam.  Maybe me.  You save that for one of your eight fucking radio shows.  Keep that bro shit of our show.  I would appreciate it.  When's the Sam Roberts Sports Spectacular show going to start here on Sirius XM Satellite  Radio?  I'm developing a demo right now.  I was listening to your fine interview yesterday.  Right.  With Cal Ripken Jr. 
[00:07:30]  Legend.  Yeah.  You know, I saw him.  I was leaving as he was coming.  And I swear to you, because a bunch of people fucking attacked me on Twitter and they probably  got to you too.  You guys wouldn't stay a few extra minutes to interview Cal Ripken Jr.?  I didn't even know he was in the building.  I had no idea that you were interviewing him, Sam.  You're very mysterious.  You're keeping shit from us.  Well, I didn't tell you guys because you guys sabotaged things.  And we had kind of a weird issue with Cal Ripken Jr. because we brought up the Kevin Costner 
[00:08:00]  thing.  Oh, right.  We were the only show that brought up the Kevin Costner thing.  That was my ignorance, actually.  I didn't know.  Somebody said, hey, Anthony, bring up the Kevin Costner thing.  Was it you that day?  Yes.  Oh, it was you?  Because I didn't know.  Because I don't remember if it was me or you on that one.  I never heard the story.  And then somebody just said it on Pal Talk or instant feedback or something.  So I just went, hey, Cal, what's the deal with...  Oh, man.  Everything just fucking came apart.  It was really uncomfortable. 
[00:08:30]  Everything came apart.  Kevin Costner and you, something.  And I didn't know.  And everybody just started looking like, oh, boy.  Oh, no, you didn't just ask that.  Because I didn't know.  Well, there's a rumor that they actually had a power outage so Cal Ripken Jr. could continue  his streak there.  His streak, yeah.  And the reason was, this was the...  It's the rumor.  The rumor.  Thank you.  Urban legend.  Just a legend, yes.  That Cal Ripken Jr., you know, game day, found out that Kevin Costner might have been  with his wife or something.  Oh, Jesus.  So...  Was he DMing him? 
[00:09:00]  So...  I didn't know Twitter was around.  Oh, it wasn't around back then?  I didn't think that.  Oh, shit.  So, uh...  Oh, my God.  So, uh, rumor has it...  Yeah.  They didn't want to fuck up Cal Ripken Jr.'s streak, so they made the lights go out at  the ballpark.  Wow.  Canceling the game so Cal could deal with some personal issues.  Could deal with fucking Kevin Costner.  So that rumor's been out there forever.  I don't know if it's true, false. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  I have no fucking idea.  What does Snopes say?  But then it extends, and it becomes all these different stories, because after the Cal Ripken  interview, somebody called me and said, hey, the one thing you didn't ask him about, I  heard that once they put the power outage, they had a power outage in the stadium, because  the cops had to come to his house because he was beating his wife.  Oh, shit.  That's not even the story.  Well, that's the problem.  It just keeps, you know, growing.  So, we got through it that day.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  So I'm leaving here yesterday.  I swear, I had no idea Cal Ripken Jr. was in the building, and that Sam was going to  interview him, because, like I said, Sam's very mysterious.  Yeah.  And I'm walking down the long hall, and he's coming the other way.  I'm like, just the possibility he might remember or know what we look like.  I fucking had my head buried in my chest as I walked past him.  Yeah, yeah.  Very nerve-wracking.  Oh, my God.  And the bookers are looking at me, because they see me coming, and they're like, what's 
[00:10:30]  the fuck is that about?  I couldn't get out of this building fast enough.  Snopes is saying false.  They're saying false.  All right.  Well, that's one of those weird fucking rumors.  It's just one of those rumors, one of those urban myths now that are out there.  What did he say that day?  I don't remember anymore.  I believe he said it didn't happen.  And then he was like, fuck you guys.  And then he was just like, it just brought the whole mood of the interview down.  Oh, you think?  It wasn't a happy, nice interview like Sam Roberts gave yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  I thought he was cool as shit.  Yeah.  The guy is cool.  He's a very cool guy.  Except when you bring up the possibility of his wife sleeping with Kevin Costner.  Kevin Costner.  Oh, my God.  I thought you were very well-informed.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  And it was a good back and forth.  Sports legend.  Sitting across from him, his vibe, you would think that he doesn't realize he's one of the  greatest baseball players of all time.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Like, he's just like, I'm just another player who played the game.  That's the guy.  But I just played.  I just showed up for the games.  You're buying into it.  Maybe.  He's fully aware he's one of the greatest players ever.  He puts on a good front.  He's fully aware.  A lot of people beat me up about the four-day work week.  Are you kidding?  Oh, boy.  The bosses want you to stay late and work Saturdays for the same pay in this economy.  Fuckers.  Yeah, because they want to get their money's worth.  Oh, yeah.  But their money's worth could be four days a week easily for a lot of people out there  listening to our voices.  Do you know what would happen, though, with a four-day work week? 
[00:12:00]  Like, the management bosses, the upper echelon, would look and say, oh, four-day work week.  Well, if we go to a five-day work week, we can now obviously cut back on the staff.  Right.  So they would fire a bunch of people and then just go to the five-day work week.  Right, of course.  And have everybody make up.  Because you obviously have time to do two jobs over the course of five days.  Yeah.  You know, the haters of this radio show, they really need to, like, do something with their  own lives at this point. 
[00:12:30]  They do.  They hate the show.  They really need to fucking worry about their lives.  Now we got people complaining about the intro to the show.  That's how bad this is getting.  Well, that's...  Fucking DJ Ain't a Lightbulb, who's a regular from Dallas.  You've got to worry about your own life at this point.  What's his problem?  I love Ricky Gervais, but I'm sick of hearing him say, that's what you like, isn't it?  Will you please ask Troy Isaac?  I don't know.  Chris Isaac.  Chris Isaac.  Oh, Troy Isaac.  Okay.  Why he decided to put that in the intro six fucking times. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, boy.  Now we're complaining about the intro of the show.  Right from the start of the show, they don't like it.  Holy fuck.  Right from the absolute beginning of the show, unhappy right there.  Probably should worry about making your own life better.  Or create something yourself.  Exactly.  There you go.  Exactly.  I would love to know what some of these haters have created for themselves.  Yeah.  I already know the answer, so you don't have to tell me.  But if you're now complaining about the intro, I don't know what to tell you. 
[00:13:30]  The intro's a week old, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's a week old.  A week and a half old.  It's brand new.  And Ricky Gervais is in the intro talking about the show.  It's pretty big.  Yeah, Ricky Gervais, pretty big name these days.  So I don't know what Mars was thinking.  Mars is a hater.  Mars wants to...  Look, I got some hot buttons.  I'll be the first to admit it.  I don't need someone fucking remind me of stuff that bothers me.  Mars!  Maybe he's resentful that you won't be his friend. 
[00:14:00]  And so he's trying to...  He wants you to feel some pain as well.  I choose not to have a lot of friends.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really do.  Do you have a lot of friends there?  That's a good decision.  Do you have a lot of friends?  Not really.  You have a lot of acquaintances.  I know that.  I have a lot of acquaintances.  And I have a couple of really good friends that I've had for many years.  Right.  I got a few of those.  And other than that, no, not a lot.  Yeah.  It's a pretty small circle.  Yeah.  I like keeping it tight.  Yeah.  What about bros? 
[00:14:30]  Bros?  You deal with that bro shit, Sam.  Okay.  How many bros do I have?  I'm trying to get the bro thing going on our show.  It ain't happening.  Bro.  Hey, bro.  And stop hiding shit from our radio show.  Yeah, but yeah, it's practice.  We would have liked the choice to maybe confront Cal Ripken Jr.  Uh, no, we wouldn't.  Um, no.  We would have ran like pussies.  Yeah.  You got a clip from your interview?  Yeah, I thought you might find it interesting.  And then what happened with the replay?  They fucking jabbed you on it, huh?  I don't know.  I was like, yeah.  What do you mean? 
[00:15:00]  What happened?  It didn't air.  They aired last Tuesdays, I guess.  Oh.  Fuck up in the system?  There was a fuck up in the system, the matrix.  That's what you call, by the way.  Too much DM.  A resume.  DMing going on instead of making sure things are proper.  That could be, too.  That could be.  I don't know.  That's a resume clip that you got there.  Yeah.  That's one you put in, put on your reel, and, uh, yeah.  I made sure that one was on video.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You need to get, because now if you want a gig somewhere, sports radio. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Hey, I talked to Kyle Ripken.  He liked me.  Look at this.  Here's an example of my work.  And people, brilliant.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Just brilliant.  He's not even nervous.  It's great.  Literally, no, I'm not nervous, because Kyle Ripken Jr. means nothing to me.  I don't know anything about sports.  Right, see?  Because you had no clue.  Fine job, though.  Did you ask him about his brother, Billy?  No.  Did you know he had a brother, Billy?  Yeah.  I asked him a little bit about his father.  He brought up his brother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said, oh, my brother was also playing in the Major Leagues.  We were on the same team for a short period of time. 
[00:16:00]  And I'm like, oh, boy, that must have sucked me and the brother.  Yeah.  What was he like?  The guy that was like, yeah.  Yeah, I'm not going to come in today.  I don't feel very well.  I go, all right.  You know, your brother's here.  Yeah, I know.  A fucking guy shows up for work every goddamn day.  Yeah, I don't feel too good.  What was his streak?  That would be good.  Yeah, yeah.  How many games in a row did Billy Rifkin get to play?  Three games in a row.  And then he's like, yeah, I got shit to do.  What a great angle. 
[00:16:30]  I drank with Billy Rifkin a couple times.  Really?  Yep.  Billy and Curt Schilling back in the day when they were playing for the Rochester Red Wings.  Oh, boy.  They sure went a little further than that.  Yeah, I got to see a bunch of these guys before they became big stars.  Yeah.  Big stars.  A few other guys on that team, I bet you, I didn't even realize at the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There wasn't much else to do in Rochester.  No, that's for sure.  Drink a few and then look at minor league baseball.  You know, we've beat the shit out of Cleveland. 
[00:17:00]  I understand that.  But I want to make something clear to people.  Because people are dumb fucks and don't understand this.  Yeah.  I don't have a problem with the people of Cleveland.  That's what we were saying over and over again yesterday.  But, no, people don't hear that, apparently.  I don't have a problem with the people of Cleveland.  They were great.  We had a great appearance.  Because then somebody wrote, if you hate Cleveland so much, why'd you do your show there?  It's like, because we have a great rapport with the people of Cleveland.  We were huge when we were on regular radio in Cleveland. 
[00:17:30]  And the fans are great in Cleveland.  See, I give up.  I give up.  I really give up.  Because, remember what I said yesterday?  Yeah.  Before the show and during the show, we did the exact same thing.  We wanted to make it perfectly clear.  I said to Anthony before the show, and he was in complete agreement, I'm like, we've got to do this carefully.  Because we really like our fans up there.  I'm fans of both.  But it is a city you really need to talk about.  Because it's a really strange fucking place.  It's like the Twilight Zone.  So I go, Dan, let's make sure they realize the love we have for those people. 
[00:18:00]  And I would absolutely go back to Cleveland just to hang with the people again.  Yes.  But fuck, that city's weird.  So they didn't fucking listen close enough.  No, no.  Then why'd you fucking show up?  I check Twitter less because I think the IQ of some of the people that listen to this show have no right tweeting me.  It's ridiculous.  I'll be honest with you.  Yeah.  Because they don't have a basic understanding of knowledge.  They can't listen to something and comprehend it. 
[00:18:30]  There's a lot of dumb fucking people out there.  Not much comprehension going on.  There were multiple people.  During the Ripken interview yesterday, at one point I said, you don't strike me as a guy who likes to take days off in general.  It's like a little irony, jokey thing.  There were people, multiple, who Twittered me thinking it was a dumb statement, not realizing that I was aware of the irony of the statement.  That's the IQ.  Oh, my God.  You should have to pass some kind of IQ test before you tweet me.  Yes.  I'm serious. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Some of the stuff I read, I'm dumbfounded.  I'm like, really?  And how are you a fan of the show then?  Yeah.  How are you possibly a fan?  How do you even know how to tie your fucking shoes in the morning?  And you're tweeting me like we're equals?  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  It really is infuriating sometimes.  When I read that, I'm just like, we made a point of saying so many times that the fans were great and the appearance was great.  Jimmy's show, fantastic.  The people were amazing.  But the city's a fucking weird, goddamn empty city. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  And that's all they hear.  Then why'd you fucking do it?  I'm fascinated by the city.  I really am.  I've been lucky enough to go to a bunch of cities in America.  But Cleveland, it's its own beast.  It's really fucking strange.  We don't talk about other cities as much as we do Cleveland.  No.  Because it's fucking weird.  They take pride in their city, obviously.  They keep it nice and clean and stuff.  But there's no one around.  No one around.  Plenty of cops.  And then they're bombing fucking bridges, I guess. 
[00:20:00]  And there's some kind of weird fucking terrorist group coming out of Cleveland.  And that's where I go back to the IQ thing.  Safe to say at this point that I've gotten the fucking article on the people that might have attempted.  Oh, you got that one?  I think I might have got it probably a thousand times at this point.  You know what you didn't get, though?  I love this.  And a few this morning writing, I don't know if you saw this or not.  No, it's safe to say I have at this point.  Probably did. 
[00:20:30]  You know what I bet you didn't see?  Huh?  How about the grandmas watching the Kardashians?  I've seen it!  Why?  You saw that?  Oh, shit.  I was just going to send it to you.  Holy mother of fuck.  If you don't hit me up with that immediately, it's safe to say that we got it.  We probably have seen it.  I do appreciate people that are trying to push material our way for the radio show.  Wow.  But a lot of you guys are way late to the party.  Now all I have to do is read some of the lines in the tweet, and I know what the picture is. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  It's like, hey, is this your closet?  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, it's the one with all the guns and shit on the wall.  And it's like, hey, Anthony, wouldn't you like to cook on this?  Oh, it's the pistol-shaped barbecue.  Okay, I get it.  And then DJ in a light bulb is back.  Oh, boy, I love the show, bro.  It's never been better.  Just don't get the intro.  I didn't do shit.  He doesn't get it.  Who gives a fuck?  It's an intro to a stupid show.  Oh, he doesn't get it. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, boy.  Well, we've got to change that intro, I guess.  Wow.  You think any of those guys were at our gig?  Because I've been asked that a million times, too.  Yeah?  You know, the Cleveland guys.  Oh, those bridge-bomber guys.  The bridge-bombing guys.  Boy, you know, who knows?  There's pictures of them, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I looked closely at them.  Did they look familiar?  They looked like everybody?  Oh, that guy could have been.  Oh, they were all there.  They were all there.  I don't know. 
[00:22:00]  I would say, to be fair, I would say maybe two of them.  What a motley crew.  They really, so what is the story with these guys?  They wanted to blow up a bridge.  Yeah, they were going to use smoke bombs as a diversion or something.  Smoke bombs?  Yeah.  Well, fuck.  Wasn't it foggy when we were up there?  Yeah.  They didn't need smoke bombs.  And what was their reasoning?  What's their cause?  Well, they're anarchists and angry with corporate America and the government.  Men! 
[00:22:30]  All right.  All right.  Oh, boy.  The Ohio Bridge links two wealthy Cleveland suburbs.  Oh, well, you've got to break that link, then.  You're an anarchist.  The alleged plotters researched explosives and obtained what they thought was C4.  Ah, but what was it?  In fact, it was harmless, and the public was never at risk, because the men got it from  the informant.  Oh, so there was the informant, they gave him that, they placed it at the base of the 
[00:23:00]  bridge.  Ah.  They actually planted this fake C4 on the bridge?  Wow.  I didn't think they got that far.  Good thing those informants, you know, good thing they asked the wrong people for explosives.  And they entered the code that they thought would actually blow the bridge up, since it's  as if, like, in the cartoons, they pushed down the big one.  Oh, really?  They pushed down the plunger.  From Acme?  And then nothing.  Nothing happened?  Where was the Roadrunner when this was going on? 
[00:23:30]  They must have been like, man, this sucks.  Yeah.  Fucking, it's your fault, man.  You put the igniter in wrong.  You put the code in?  It's not the code, dude.  Let's see.  What's the code?  Wow.  That's pretty good, though, that they got him doing it that much, because then it really  shows they had an intent of doing this.  Holy shit.  See, now I've got wise-ass friends.  I thought I just heard you say nobody sent you this article, and it's the article on the  Cleveland fucking bridge thing.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll get that. 
[00:24:00]  From my pal who used to play in the NFL.  NFL.  Cal Ripken, Jr.  So this is what went down on your show, Sam?  Oh, yeah, I thought you might be interested in his take on the Ali being carted out for  the Marlins thing.  What do you know about sports today?  Today?  Yeah, what are the big headlines?  Right now.  Mm-mm.  I gave you a speech yesterday, and Anthony even called me out on it.  Two days ago.  He goes, why are you trying to make Sam better?  You do realize he's going to replace us today.  He'll just take our jobs.  Yeah.  Sports headlines. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, I said you need to know just basic shit about sports.  Baseball's back.  No, what?  Give me three sports stories for today.  The big ones.  What do you know about Omari Stoudemire?  Well, I know he hurt his knee.  Okay, hurt his knee.  Doing what?  What did he do?  He hurt it during a game.  Okay, good.  Running.  Good.  And he may be out.  You're kidding, right?  No, I have no idea. 
[00:25:00]  Holy fuck, Sam.  But I'm not doing a show today, so I don't need to know.  Like, I'm not doing a sports show today.  You're constantly doing shows.  Yeah, but the after show.  I don't need to talk about sports on the after show.  But if we ask you about wrestling, you'll fucking break it down for us.  That's my shit.  Stoudemire punched the shit out of a fire extinguisher.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  See, he's not the leg guy.  And it turns out it's a really, they're calling it a severe cut.  Yeah.  With stitches, and they had a repair muscle in his hand.  I could definitely do a bit on that if I was doing a show. 
[00:25:30]  And the Knicks are going to play without him, which is good or bad, Sam, according to  the sports pages.  Well, the thing about it is...  Good, because they have a better record without him on the court.  Yeah.  Carmelo Anthony's on the court.  Oh.  Proven to be a ball hog.  Ball hog.  And it's like, you know, what are we doing with him?  I was trying to do a magoo there.  Oh.  Ball hog.  What was his name?  Road hog, right?  Road hog.  Road hog.  Road hog.  Ah.  Don, I miss you.  You've done it again.  So Stoudemire's out for game three and possibly game four. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, you know, Jeremy Lin.  The Knicks are fucked.  Jeremy Lin's a bust.  He's not a bust.  Yeah.  He might come back for game four is the rumor.  Oh, really?  Him and Carmelo Anthony have never figured out that chemistry.  How about the Flyers and the Devils?  They played last night.  Never.  Who won?  The Flyers and the Devils.  I don't know.  Hockey is like, that's a little fringe, I think.  Playoff hockey is fringe, yeah.  Maybe playoff hockey.  I guess you're right.  This is Cal Ripken Jr. on Sam's show. 
[00:26:30]  You've done work with Athletes for Hope, with a lot of other people, Muhammad Ali being one of them.  What did you think when the Marlins brought him out for their season opener?  I know a lot of people, some people were excited to see him, and other people didn't really want to see him with his health the way it is.  Muhammad Ali, you're talking about?  I had a chance to, quite recently, I was speaking at a conference, which he was at, and I had a chance to communicate with him.  Yeah.  Boring! 
[00:27:00]  It's a dream come true to be able to sit and talk to him.  I've had some experience.  No, it's not.  Well, maybe it is.  But you're not talking to him.  No.  No one talks to Ali anymore.  You're talking and he's shaking.  And he's shaking at you.  Some experiences over time.  And I don't look at it as parading him out, per se.  I mean, some people look at that from the outside.  You know, he's still pretty vibrant on the inside.  And so, to me, he is who he is. 
[00:27:30]  And you think that this is something that he wants to be doing?  I think that's what a lot of people are wondering.  Does this guy want to be doing this?  Yeah, I think he was alive.  You know, he was a personality.  He could relate to everybody.  Absolutely.  Everybody loved him.  He became the international star that he is.  Yeah.  You know, partly because he was a great boxer, but mostly because he was a great personality and a great person.  Yeah.  So, I think, yeah, it probably fits with what he would want to do.  He's doing it willingly, yes.  I doubt it. 
[00:28:00]  Mm-mm.  I would have challenged him on it.  What?  I'm sorry.  I was phasing out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That whole thing.  Thank God we didn't talk to him.  Oh, God, I can't.  Who cares?  He's a big baseball star.  People really did like the interview, though.  That's very nice.  Oh, they did?  A lot of good feedback.  All right, good.  That's very nice.  Makes our show better if you do a good show, so fucking keep doing good shows, Sam.  You got it.  All right.  I can't believe that they've even got this series, The Devils and the Flyers.  Just pops it up on NHL.com.  I know. 
[00:28:30]  He's just like, yeah, let me sound like I know what I'm doing here.  The minute you think you got a team, you know, they're back, tied up.  We're going to see, though, who's the best.  Yeah?  You should watch some hockey, man.  I would enjoy hockey, I think.  I think you would.  Yeah.  There's a lot of action and intrigue.  I like drama.  You know what?  I didn't even realize that the year anniversary of us killing Osama bin Laden passed, you didn't  really see much about it on the news at all. 
[00:29:00]  No, no.  If you really didn't search it out, you'd never know.  Everyone's trying to spin this one.  Yes.  The Democrats and Obama are, you know, reminding people.  Right.  And the Republicans are just, ah, you're politicizing this.  You're using it for political gain.  No matter.  Everyone does.  Thank you.  No matter what side you're on, they would politicize a big event like that.  Of course you would.  It just happens to be Obama's turn to politicize. 
[00:29:30]  But if there was a Republican in there, he would have done the exact same fucking thing.  Same thing.  Hey, remember last year when, you know, he took that guy out?  Why can't anyone admit that on these news channels?  Yeah.  They got their angle.  They got their, you know, their stance, and they have to go with it.  Yeah.  There's no, it's obviously going to be used no matter who fucking did it.  Right.  I do think it's pretty ridiculous, though, that Obama is saying that Romney wouldn't have gone in. 
[00:30:00]  Or they're questioning if Romney had the balls to do that.  Yeah.  Of course Romney would have done it.  And you can't speculate about something that wasn't even in the realm of happening.  And you can't say, oh, he would have done this, or, oh, he would have done that.  It's ridiculous to even bring that up.  Of course it is.  You know, take your bow for being the president when that happened.  These guys choose their battles, but this one's stupid, because either side would have fucking taken them out.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  And both sides would have politicized it.  Yeah.  Period.  That's it.  I mean, I think they should release the photos, too.  Yeah, I think so.  That's a big thing that for some reason they think it'll be detrimental around the world.  It might spark some terrorism.  Right.  But if you ask me, terrorists aren't sitting there going like, oh, now they really pissed  me off.  Right.  Now we're going to do something.  I think they're always pissed and always looking to do something. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Don't.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Show the pictures.  Everyone's still thinking, you know, there's still those people going, oh, is he really dead?  You want to see the pictures?  Sure.  You want to see the pictures?  Yeah.  Are we talking about the same pictures?  Uh, Osama bin Laden death pictures?  Uh, I got pictures for you.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Which ones?  You see, uh, Gretzky's, uh, Gretzky's daughter yet?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Pop that up.  Holy fuck. 
[00:31:30]  It looks like, it looks like, it looks like somebody wasn't home enough.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  It looks like someone grew up without a father because he was too busy being the great  one.  All right.  And this, this went viral yesterday, man.  Gretzky has a really, really hot blonde daughter because he was, uh, he's married to that model.  So their offspring, uh, turned out pretty good.  Yeah.  She is, uh, in the news and on the gossip sites because she, uh, has all sorts of pictures 
[00:32:00]  where she's completely spreading her legs.  What?  She's wearing clothes, but barely.  Oh, oh.  Show me some really good pictures.  Show me some really good pictures.  She's spreading her legs.  I forgot what site this was on yesterday, but she loves showing off her body.  There you go.  There you go.  Holy vacaroni.  There you go.  That's Gretzky's daughter.  You could pretty much see her, her, her twat.  You could see some lip, uh, action going on.  You absolutely can. 
[00:32:30]  What, uh.  She's wearing a tiny little bathing suit, bikini.  And then what's over the bikini there, Sam?  Like little, little tiny, short, tiny, tiny, tiny, daisy dukes.  Yeah.  And then she's, uh, leaning all the way back and just spreading her legs as far as she  possibly can.  What the hell?  Wow.  She looks like she might be a little party girl.  Yeah, huh?  There you go.  She was drinking.  Is she, uh, what's the, uh, drinking age up there?  Is she in Canada?  Where is she?  Yeah, I think they live in L.A., right? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think they're doing the L.A. thing, right?  L.A.  I believe so, yes.  Maybe she was sticking to her Canadian roots.  No.  Ooh, there you go.  There are the pictures, Ant.  Wow.  That we all need to see.  Yeah, she's fucking pretty hot.  Jesus Christ.  She's pretty hot.  I don't know what she does.  She can just be a fucking hot chick.  Yeah, I think she's just a hot chick.  She doesn't have to do anything.  She's got that fucking Gretzky money, right?  Yeah, she's trying to become the great one.  She is.  Well, it's pretty great right there.  It really is great. 
[00:33:30]  I gotta say.  Oh, is that a picture of, oh, my God, father and daughter?  Aw!  Wow.  Oh, Wayne Gretzky looks like he's just a dick.  I think.  I know he's the great one and all, blah, blah, blah.  Probably the greatest hockey player ever.  Most people wouldn't even argue that.  Yes.  Maybe Gordie Howe.  Nah.  Oh, look at that.  Gordie Howe.  More sports stuff.  Hey, ladies, I hate those fucking dresses.  Oh, you do?  I hate those dresses.  The poofy bottom dresses?  They look like a dress, and then they go down into the, you know, the lower skirty kind 
[00:34:00]  of portion of the dress, and then they get bubbly, and then they come back in on the  legs.  Yeah.  So it looks like a fucking sack.  What do they call it?  A potato sack dress or something?  I don't like that at all.  I like a nice, short fucking skirt.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that shit?  All sacky looking.  Obama's calling out Romney because Romney called out Obama on Bin Laden.  Whatever.  Oh, really?  Whatever. 
[00:34:30]  He said, she said.  Is that what we're dealing with here?  I don't even give a fuck who our next president is at this point.  I really don't.  I don't give a fuck.  As long as it wasn't Santorum.  Yeah.  As long as Santorum's out of it.  Yeah, Obama took a little trip over there to Afghanistan.  Yep.  Huh?  You think that's cool?  Afghanistan.  If you're a soldier over there and all of a sudden you're like, holy fuck, Obama's  here?  No, because the soldiers know to.  They're just like, all right, it's an election year.  Yeah.  He's coming over here to kind of, you know, crow a little bit. 
[00:35:00]  The guy has a tough time just talking to people.  Yeah.  He's very socially awkward.  It's really weird because he was known as the, you know, kind of like a communicator  with those speeches and stuff.  It was the keynote address he did.  Right.  But when he throws all that paper away and, and, and the wordy word machine, he can't  just have a conversation with people around him.  Yeah.  It's really strange.  Yeah.  He's very awkward.  He seems a bit awkward and nervous. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  And trust me, cause I'm not, I'm not a Romney guy.  Romney sucks too.  Romney can't talk to people.  He, uh, Romney comes off as a little insincere.  Let's just say there's really no, no humanity there.  It doesn't seem like he's really trying to just be the president.  And that comes across.  What's not coming across is what type of person he is.  You know, it's, uh, or maybe it is, maybe that is the type of person he is.  He's trying to come across like he's a regular guy.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Who likes to joke.  Oh, yeah.  Likes to tell people he's funny.  But you know, when, when he, I hate those speeches when they're at the, the factory and  all the people around, he goes, you know, during my travels of this great nation, I've  met so many fine Americans that I've, shut up.  You did not.  First of all, you, you meet people for a half a second, possibly.  Yeah.  What can you get from a person when you say hi and move on to the next guy?  Yeah.  You're not sitting down and actually listening to what they have to say. 
[00:36:30]  You are for the photo op when they throw him in a diner or something, uh, where he's  just sitting there having some eggs.  Ah, roll, let me roll up my shirt sleeves and have my eggs, you know, damn well.  He's not touching the eggs when the camera turns off.  Obama's a big one for the rolling up the shirt sleeves.  Well, that says a lot.  It means I'm getting, I'm, I'm, I'm getting to work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That means I'm getting to work.  I'm going to work.  I got to roll up these shirt sleeves and get in, use some elbow grease like fake casual 
[00:37:00]  Fridays.  Yeah.  It's so funny.  What Obama's not fucking working.  Hey, what's about, what are you doing?  Checking out my, my limo.  Uh, let me lift the hood, crack the hood.  I'm going to, I'm going to dig in there and let me roll up these sleeves and get under  the hood.  Let me check those injectors.  You know, these asshole executives, they, they actually go shopping for their casual Friday  clothes.  Really?  It's not, so it's not really casual.  They're casual Friday clothes.  You go for actual casual Friday clothes to give the look that you're casual, but you're  overthinking it already.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Man.  Wouldn't casual Friday be, you're just, ah, you know what?  Just grab something.  I'm going to put on my fucking Packers jersey today and a pair of worn jeans.  Just grab something out of the closet.  It's so uncomfortable around here when they do casual Fridays.  It's so uncomfortable.  It really is.  It's, it's absolutely.  Because it's so well thought out.  Yeah.  It's like in, uh, office space.  That was a great one.  What was it?  Yeah.  I don't remember the office space.  They had casual Friday.  Right, right, right.  They're all dressed, uh, in Hawaiian shirts, right?  They had go ahead and wear a Hawaiian shirt. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can just go ahead and wear a Hawaiian shirt.  Yeah.  That would be a true casual Friday, though.  Oh, it certainly would.  My goodness.  These assholes with their khakis and, uh.  Just looking casual, man.  Very casual.  Hey, no suit today.  Why didn't you barely recognize you without the suit on?  Yeah.  Took off the old monkey suit.  They were wearing some cash.  You want, you want, you know what?  I'm, I'm all about, you, you started a bit at.  Oh, yeah.  Romney was up in Boston yesterday doing that.  Hey, I'm just like you. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, was he?  Yeah, listen to this.  Oh, boy.  Kyle in Boston.  What's up, Kyle?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  It was up in, uh, it was actually Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  I'm a fisherman during the summer.  I work on a commercial boat.  And so the regulations have been killing us the past couple years.  So he comes up and sets up shop in front of the docks with all the fishermen and saying,  you know, we're going to change the regulations and we're going to open the fisheries, you know,  all the rah-rah shit to get us to vote for them.  But, but it says on the line that he was making believe he used to be a fisherman. 
[00:39:00]  No, I didn't say that.  It says pretending like he's one of us.  Oh, no.  You know, Boston's always been a great place for fish and fishermen and fishing, fishing boats.  Whatever.  Jesus Christ.  They are all pieces of shite.  And speaking of pieces of shite.  Tom Papa has arrived.  Tom Papa.  Hello, Levin.  How you doing, man?  What's up, Tom?  Hello, Levin.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Hello. 
[00:39:30]  You really did walk in right when I said that.  Hello.  Hello, Levin.  We're talking about politicians and how they politicize everything.  No matter what side.  Because, you know, that whole thing.  No matter what side you're on, they all do it.  The worst.  And then they make believe they don't do it and have to call out the other guy.  Yeah.  Until the next time that they do it.  Because, obviously, Obama's politicizing over the Osama bin Laden one year anniversary.  But it's fine for him to do that.  He's got to take a little credit.  That's his biggest thing.  But the Republicans are like, how dare he politicize this?  But you know damn well if it was the other way around, they would do the same thing. 
[00:40:00]  And they have done the same thing.  Of course.  Or if he blew it.  If he blew it.  If they didn't get him and they crashed.  That would have been tragic.  It would have just been Jimmy Carter all over again.  Of course.  Oh, so he loves it.  Remember when Bush landed on the aircraft carrier?  Oh, yes.  Mission accomplished.  You don't think that was politicizing?  Mission accomplished.  John Stewart said he did that before the...  Spiking the football before the game even started.  That's a pretty good line on his part.  Mission accomplished. 
[00:40:30]  When Stewart's not looking like a complete clown on TV.  Oh, man.  What happened to that guy?  What happened to him?  He's a jester.  A jester now.  Yeah.  I like Colbert better.  Holy fuck.  Colbert's a little more sarcastic.  You don't like the mugging?  You don't like the mugging?  Stewart?  Yeah.  I'm not a big fan of the mugging.  Stewart's just an over-the-top silly guy now.  What happened to him?  It's true.  Colbert does have a little more edge.  Yeah.  And Colbert, it's like he's putting on a character that is pretty much completely opposite of what  he really is. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  And it comes across very funny and sarcastic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Jon Stewart is just kind of a...  You know, come back from the clip, look at the camera, go, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Or have his finger up by his mouth, right?  Hmm?  Oh, all right.  Oh.  Wow.  You get it.  If it's working for him, great.  But that's not the Stewart a lot of us remember.  No, no.  Right.  He's an over-the-top silly guy now.  Oh, my.  Silly guy.  I like the silly guy.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, the hand on the mouth like titter, titter. 
[00:41:30]  Coming right back from a weird clip.  Naughty, naughty, naughty.  It's on TV now.  His mouth is open.  Oh, there he goes.  He's putting his hands in the air.  He's screaming.  But that's every night.  He does all that stuff.  Yeah.  And there's George W.  Getting off the...  With his giant dick.  He spiked the football before the game had even started.  Didn't he just say that?  Oh, my God.  And had been killed on Bush's watch.  This would have...  All right.  They do still have good writing. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  They did that thing last week on CNN.  They exposed CNN's coverage of everything.  Making a big title about everything.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They do see stuff and gather stuff up that other shows don't.  No, I think they do a good job.  It's just weird to see how Jon Stewart has changed over the last few years.  It's really bizarre.  He needs a clown hat.  He really does.  He shouldn't go out there in a suit anymore.  If you look under the desk, there's two curly shoes with bells on the end. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, it used to be a little more of a news type show with a lot of humor to it.  See, there you go.  On the cover of Newsweek, he's making a...  He's making a wacky face.  A wacky face.  What?  You think that's the one he wanted them to use, though?  Like, you know, they took a shitload of pictures.  And they're like, all right, just give us a face.  And he's like, oh, they used that one.  Oh, that's the one that was awful.  On Newsweek, and they used that.  CNN is intense, though, man. 
[00:43:00]  That Wolf Blitzer has a situation.  Yeah.  Every fucking day there's a situation with this guy.  How about you calm down the situation room?  Yeah.  There's not a situation every time you're on the air.  Well, you're allowed to sit.  Holy fuck.  With your little legs.  How about you tell the people, today we're not going to have a situation?  Here's the situation.  Everything's all right.  Everything's fine.  Everything's okay.  You could shut down some of those screens behind you.  Right.  Shut down, like, four or five panels.  Because it's a two-panel day.  It really is.  The end of the world is not happening in the next five minutes. 
[00:43:30]  He's like, ah, let's look at the screens.  Ah, that one.  And the Fox News, though, is really bad with their Fox News alerts.  Right.  That used to be when something was happening.  Now it's every time.  What do you mean something?  When 9-11 was happening.  Right.  9-11.  News alerts.  Shung, Fox News alert.  Holy shit.  Manhattan's in flames.  It's true.  Yeah.  Their never forget for 9-11 was never forget that if we scare the crap out of these people, 
[00:44:00]  they're going to listen.  They're going to watch all day long.  It's a Pavlov's dog thing, though.  The second year, shung, Fox News alert.  You turn your head and you look alive.  What?  And you get nervous.  Yeah.  You freak out.  What's happening?  Nothing.  It's like, well, Congress is looking into a bill that...  It's like, look, all right, really, did that deserve a Fox News alert?  The Dow is down a half a point.  Yes.  Wow.  No.  All of it is just panic. 
[00:44:30]  Just panic, panic.  You know what I hate is when you go to the airport and you're, you know, getting there  is nerve-wracking, getting up on time is nerve-wracking, getting through traffic, getting through  security.  You're sweaty.  You're sweaty and nervous.  You haven't even started.  You're sweaty and nervous.  Then you get to the gate and it's CNN blasting on every TV about all the bad news and ways  you could die.  Horrible things.  And, you know, God forbid there is some kind of an air travel story.  Yeah.  You're sitting there like...  At that point, they should have the Cartoon Network on for everybody. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  SpongeBob.  Hey, everybody, we're flying today.  Yeah, a lot of fun cartoony sounds.  We're flying.  Yeah.  Up in the sky.  Up in the sky.  Everything's going to be okay.  Oh, it is going to be okay.  You look great today.  You told me that.  I had to...  Last night, I was watching the television and air disasters, I saw, was on on the guy.  Why would you watch that?  Well, that's just it.  I actually had to roll through my brain Rolodex and see if I was going to be 
[00:45:30]  traveling soon.  Okay, that makes sense.  So I'm like, I'm not going to be flying for a little while.  I can watch air disasters.  So I watched it.  I love it.  747 with a fire in the cargo hold.  Holy shit.  Oh, no.  Like a 2,000 degree fire in the cargo hold.  Smoke billowing into the fucking cabin.  Kills a bunch of people.  And then they crash into the Indian Ocean.  Everyone dead.  Oh, my God.  How do you sleep at night after?  You're going to think about that.  It was horrible.  Oh, it was terrible. 
[00:46:00]  You're going to think about that.  Oh, I will.  Obviously.  If it wasn't for the Bloody Marys, I would be a horrible flyer.  I like when a year goes by between flights for me, because then I think the technology  got slightly better.  But you know it's the other way, where the plane just got a year older.  You get on American Airlines and still ashtrays in the armrest.  I know.  Those are the worst.  The worst.  Like, wait a minute.  When was smoking allowed?  The bathrooms are all duct taped together.  Are you happy or scared when you look into the cockpit and see flat panels? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  When you see that old equipment, you're like, oh, fuck.  It's like needles.  I don't know how I feel.  They could tap it.  If it's not moving, they tap the gauge.  There it goes.  Ding, ding, ding.  We're good.  It's all right, Harry.  Good to go.  Flat panels means the latest technology, but when I'm home, all of a sudden my computer  will completely just crash, and there's no reason for it, and then it just pops back  up.  You think they get the blue screen of death on the flat panel?  I'm thinking if it's the old school shit that they can maybe do a work around. 
[00:47:00]  But that flat panel, I'm like, I don't know, man.  You want something you can take a wrench to.  Right.  Yeah.  I do believe, though, they all do have those backup regular gauges there.  Do they?  I've seen some JetBlue cockpits where it's like, how the fuck do they even fly this thing?  Like your basic artificial horizon, your altimeter, like airspeed indicator, like things like  that.  Yeah.  I think, you know, even if your flat panels go out, you still have that info.  The other day I was getting my tooth drilled, and I was like, what does this remind me of? 
[00:47:30]  And it reminds me of flying.  Whoa.  Like the same thing of sitting there, you hear weird noises, you smell things you don't want  to smell.  And you're horrified.  And you're just kind of in your head, just kind of go with it, and trust that this guy  knows what he's doing.  That's great.  That's really funny.  It's the same thing.  You're all tense.  You're in your seat.  Any different sound?  Yeah.  If it's just, you're okay.  You're okay.  It's the sound it makes, but then it's like, what was that? 
[00:48:00]  Are you horrified by the smells that come out of your own body?  Oh my God.  When they drill a tooth, you're like, really?  You ever have them take a cap off?  No.  Like a temporary cap?  No.  What's under there?  Oh my God.  What is that under there?  It releases the depths of hell.  That shit should just not ever be released.  It's so bad in your mouth.  My dentist once was like, you know, you've got to floss more.  That's when I was younger.  And I was like, all right, I will.  He's like, no, I'm serious. 
[00:48:30]  You really have to.  And he couldn't get through to me.  I was just like, I don't know.  Oh, whatever.  And he's like, here's what I want you to do.  He gave me floss.  He's like, floss your teeth.  I'm like, okay, I'm flossing.  I'm like showing him the technique.  Like, I got this.  I know what I'm doing.  He goes, I thought that was it.  And he goes, now smell it.  I was like, oh.  Oh.  Oh, I've been flossing every day since.  Wow.  Just the shit in your mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You walk around like a shit mouth.  A shit mouth.  I'm just pushing food down between your teeth all day long. 
[00:49:00]  Teeth is a very poor design of the teeth.  It should just be one thing.  Of course.  That just wraps around in your mouth.  Of course.  Like a beaver.  Yeah.  Just like no gaps between them.  Just.  Why are the gaps there?  Yeah.  Do we know?  I guess they couldn't figure out.  The good Lord couldn't figure out how to just make one piece come down.  The Lord Jesus Christ?  Our good Lord.  The Lord.  And Savior?  The Lord had plans for fangs.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Why do we need all these?  It should just be upper tooth, lower tooth.  How about a blender?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or fucking either.  Right on the roof of your mouth comes a little spinny thing.  And just.  It's so much easier to drink your meals.  And you have a couple spots.  Blenders should be everywhere.  Yeah.  Blenders should be everywhere.  It's so much easier to just drink it.  It's all going to be.  Just go to a steakhouse.  They bring it out.  It's nice.  It's sizzling.  And fries and all that.  And then.  Sometimes chewing.  Blender at the table.  Zzz. 
[00:50:00]  And you drink it.  Sometimes chewing.  It's like really.  The worst.  I'm not into this meal.  I would rather drink it.  And move on with my fucking day.  And don't you have like teeth that.  That's like spots.  Where that's your.  That's your food collector spot.  Oh yeah.  Don't chew over there.  Yeah.  I got a food pocket.  Oh God.  A food pocket.  Pocket.  And they've been trying for years.  To figure this thing out.  Oh God.  And it's a pain in the ass to keep it clean.  It's the worst.  Yeah.  How do you get in there?  I don't know.  I floss. 
[00:50:30]  He even closed the gap.  So the food pocket is not as much.  But now the dental floss is the pain in the ass to get between those two teeth.  Now there's broken floss in the food pocket.  Oh God.  Shrimp and clams are not my friend.  Because that shit collects in my food pocket.  Do you ever have a day where you're like.  I'm not going to clean the food pocket.  And then.  Oh.  I have to.  And then like a big chunk of beef.  Like the size of a small fillet comes out.  You're like.  What if I hadn't?  A fillet. 
[00:51:00]  Oh God.  There is a news story about a girl who is a dentist.  And pulled out all of her ex-boyfriend's teeth.  Oh man.  Why?  This guy's an idiot.  He is an idiot.  He is an idiot.  Right?  Yeah.  What happened?  He had broken up with this girl.  Right?  And then he had an appointment.  She was a dentist.  And he had an appointment to see her before they broke up.  And then the time came about for the appointment.  And he decided to go.  So he went.  She anesthetizes him.  And pulled out every one of his teeth.  He ripped his fucking teeth out. 
[00:51:30]  Where do these stories happen?  I don't know.  Where do these stories happen?  That's hilarious.  Where?  That's a good question.  Was that Bangladesh?  Yeah.  Is it a real story?  Is it a real story?  You think?  Because that certainly sounds horrific.  Polish.  Polish dentist.  I will pull.  I've known some Polish girls.  They are pretty vindictive.  Oh my God.  You know.  What are you doing?  Why do you do that to me?  Why do you do not need these teeth now?  Oh.  Man.  You will not need these teeth anymore.  I wonder if she was getting DMs. 
[00:52:00]  Getting what?  After they broke up.  Direct messages.  You know.  That just happens.  I don't know.  But.  Yeah.  It just happens.  But is it a true story?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean.  Rip that out.  In Poland.  Yeah.  ABC's reporting on it.  Oh.  Well then it's got to be true.  Breaking news.  Yeah.  Fox News Alert.  Let's see.  Let's see how ABC News handles the story.  With a chuckle you think?  Oh no.  It's a horror story.  But.  Wait. 
[00:52:30]  Let's go through all the features here.  All right.  How does the mainstream news take care of a story like this?  I think with a tad bit of humor.  I think they're going to chuckle at this one a little.  And then they're going to criticize the guy for going to her in the first place.  Yeah.  Like.  Like.  Why would you do that?  A little tongue in cheek.  Yeah.  A little tongue in cheeky.  Right.  They won't do a total serious thing here.  All right.  Let's see.  World News Now.  World News Now delivers your morning papers.  Oh.  That's a good name for it.  It's time for the morning papers. 
[00:53:00]  This first story really is something.  So there was a breakup.  It's never easy.  But apparently the dumpy was a scorned dentist.  Well her ex-boyfriend decides that he's going to keep his appointment with her.  Look at him trying to act.  He's shaking his head.  Well while he is under anesthesia she surgically removes all 32 of her ex-boyfriend's teeth.  Because he dumps her.  Are they playing sound effects? 
[00:53:30]  Are they playing sound effects?  Yeah.  Wait.  That's our sound effect.  Yeah.  That was the whole one.  I thought the mm-mm was you.  No.  But the sound effect was you.  No.  No.  That's him.  No.  The guy decided he needs to be ghetto now for this story.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh shit.  He's talking about Robbie or Obama.  He's not doing that.  But when it comes to teeth pulling.  Oh.  She pulled them teeth out.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  How many teeth?  He actually said good low.  Good low.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  He's crossing his arms and shaking.  Yeah.  He's wheeling away from the desk.  That ain't right though.  And then they're playing screamy sound effects. 
[00:54:00]  Why do they add though to the end of sentences?  I don't understand this.  I don't even know though.  What a joke.  If you want to have fun for maybe five minutes, put T-H-O in the Twitter search.  Uh-huh.  It'll blow your mind.  How do you just put T-H-O at the end of sentences?  It's true.  What the fuck?  Like a retarded Shakespeare.  Uh.  Yeah.  Back to the story.  Years old is the now person with no teeth. 
[00:54:30]  All 32 teeth.  All 32 teeth.  All 32 teeth.  34 year old Anna Mekowiak is the dentist who now is under investigation for medical malpractice,  abusing the trust of a patient, and apparently she could face three years in jail.  But this is my question.  Why did he dump her?  Maybe she was a little nutty.  And so if she was a little nutty, then why do you go and get, why do you keep the appointment?  Yeah, that's what, I'd like to cancel my extraction for Thursday.  Now he's doing a routine.  Now he's doing a phone call. 
[00:55:00]  He's got a phone.  He's doing Cosby, making a phone call.  He did Cosby slash fucking prior there.  I'm going to have to cancel my appointment.  This is ABC News?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is like their show that comes out at like four o'clock in the morning nationally.  That is really, wow.  That's like, that is a mockery.  It's a mockery of the news.  It really is.  Yeah, yeah.  Sound effects.  He's doing shticks and playing sound effects.  I wish I could do Cosby.  Screamy sound effects.  The guy does Cosby.  Let me see. 
[00:55:30]  I'll get out to cancel my extraction because I want to keep my teeth.  Now all he can eat is Jell-O on, Mr. Cosby.  Jell-O.  This is why when you watch Network now, it just seems like a telling of what happens on the news.  Who are you?  My name's Sam.  Sam Roberts.  Hi, Sam.  We were speaking earlier.  Oh.  Go back to this.  This is coming in with the X with the pliers and the Novocate putting me up and taking all my teeth.  I mean, you didn't deserve this to happen, but it wasn't the smartest thing. 
[00:56:00]  She's obviously a little nuts, but come on now.  Why keep the appointment?  Hell hath no fury.  How many ways do you have learned?  Now, enjoy your pudding.  There it is.  Atta Kate may hear about this honeybee shortage all the time.  They are morons.  He's waiting for the crops and all this.  They are morons.  They don't even have a point of view, either.  They're just throwing.  No.  That guy's crazy because she's crazy and we'll enjoy your pudding.  Yeah, there wasn't a real thought out reaction to the story. 
[00:56:30]  They're just, she's crazy.  Why would he go?  He's crazy.  Yeah.  He crazy, she crazy.  Two clowns.  Yeah.  And he really ended with pudding.  He really did the Cosby all the way.  Let's put THO on Twitter.  Let's see what's coming up right now.  You got your pudding and you're pulling your teeth when you break up with a girl.  Doing Sammy Davis Jr. slash Cosby slash Pryor.  He's grabbing prop phones.  He's playing sound effects.  That is not the news. 
[00:57:00]  No, no.  Not even close.  Good God.  Give us some of the THOs coming in right now.  You think Walter Cronkite ever did a shtick on the news?  Exactly.  We can push this chair away from the desk.  Yeah.  Well, let me grab a phone.  That's the way it was.  Manda Perez says, no, really.  Obama shouts out Young Jeezy, though?  Yeah.  One guy says, Don Richard's EP is fire, though.  How about this one?  20 more days of school, though. 
[00:57:30]  Though.  Though.  Though.  Though.  T-H-O.  T-H-O.  Though.  Yeah.  That's a big one in the community, huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you didn't know this.

Still haven't went to sleep out to now, though. 
[00:58:00]  What is with the though?  I noticed this a while ago, and it's all black people.  This is not a white thing, man.  This is not even like a Uyghur thing where they're trying to do the black thing.  It is the weirdest thing I've ever seen on Twitter.  I noticed this is a long time ago.  Give me a couple more.  Kanye killed that don't like dough.  That's an actual tweet.  Kanye killed that don't like dough.  I'm stunned here.

With these laughing after.  No, you can't do that.  That's not the proper form.  I don't know why I'm wide awake, though.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense to put a dough there on any of this.  Wait, wait. 
[00:59:30]  Okay.  I'm mad.  I've seen a homeless person with a laptop, though.  That doesn't.  You didn't know about this.  I had no clue.  Dude, I'm telling you, you could have...  I swear, maybe I got a boring life.  You could have so much fun just fucking...  That's a good eye.  Grammatically, that sentence should read, I'm mad.  However, on the plus side, I've seen a homeless person with a laptop.  Right.  That's not what he's saying.  Not dough.  Give me a few more.  Give me a whole new page so we can look through. 
[01:00:00]  Let's see.  Let me live, though.  Who up, though?  That's a tweet.  Who up, though?  Who up, though?  It doesn't.  I wish I could sleep, though.  Who started this?  I have no idea, man.  Maybe someone in the community could help us out.  Jay-Z.  Because it's not just a little bit.  No.  It's not.  It comes in all the time on Twitter.  It's so amazing that...  Because the black people control the Twitter trends. 
[01:00:30]  The trends.  Yeah, all the cool words, the trends.  The Twitter trends are started with black people, and they're kept going by the black tweeters.  Wow.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you'll notice that.  You'll notice that, though.  You'll notice that, though.  Should we be using, though?  Yeah, I know.  I don't know, though.  Are we allowed to?  The T word.

You could foresquare that to the Red Lobster.  I can't argue that tweet.  There's nothing better than mac and cheese.  Unless you throw a little bacon in there, and then you're really talking.  Oh, man.  A little bit.  Just a little bacon.  ESPN had the biggest pause ever today, though.

I'm smelling smoked dough.  We might have to go home early to make sure this is proper, though.  I'm smelling lots of smoked dough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should clean that up with some string cheese dough.  Yeah.  String cheese.  String cheese.  And sunflower seeds.  All right.  We got to eat.  Tom Papa is here in the house. 
[01:10:00]  Yahoo!  Tom, what are you promoting today?  Anything?  My new album's on iTunes.  Oh.  Tom Papa Live in New York City.  Nice.  Other than that, nothing.  I like your Clark Kent hat.  Yeah, I wore the hat today.  I like the hat.  Yeah.  You pull it off.  Thanks.  I can't pull off a hat like that.  You can.  You just have to.  Oh, no.  I've tried to put a few of them on to see, and I'm like, oh, fuck no.  You need the right shape.  I don't know what it is.  You need to give me a good hat, though.  Yeah.  I've tried some of those fancy hats. 
[01:10:30]  I'm like, no, man.  These guys would laugh their asses off if I came in like that.  You need a pork pie with a stingy brim dough.  Stingy brim.  That's a stingy brim.  All right.  We'll be back.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Riding the star house.  Riding the star house.  Riding the star house. 
[01:11:00]  Baby beside me.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Without a sign of striving.  But it's kind of evidently.  What's going on?  I'm having delight problems here. 
[01:11:30]  No, you're not.  You're not having delight problems.  What are you doing?  What's going on?  The delight's coming out here on me.  What?  They had to bring in another monitor, and the delight beat just keeps coming out on me.  He's such a liar.  I did in the star house.  Anyway, do we really need to let right now, in the middle of your bit? 
[01:12:00]  Just as long as the song doesn't come out.  Yeah.  It sounds perfectly normal.  Fine.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Thank you.  You know, the delight sounds perfectly fine, right?  Yeah, it sounds fine. 
[01:12:30]  I just don't have a visual element for the screen here.  It's completely black.  So?  Tonight.  Why is Sam laughing?  And don't say whatever to me.  I have nothing to do with anything, fucker.  Sam, why are you hiding?  It's getting weird.  Oh, God. 
[01:13:00]  So we're riding the storm out, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Yes, this is very inside.  I'm sorry, people.  It's very strange you would pick this song.  It's his bid.  He could have went anywhere with this bid.  Went anywhere.  What?  Weather Channel 30 years ago.  30 years ago debuted.  Oh, that makes sense.  That's why we're playing Riding the Storm Out. 
[01:13:30]  I like that.  Wow, 30 years?  30 years ago today.  Everyone laughed about that whole Weather Channel thing.  Well, it was the first niche channel, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  Isn't it?  Right?  Well, there was a...  What was the first niche channel?  30 years ago, we're talking 19...  ESPN?  Maybe?  I'm going to go 1982.  Yeah.  That's 30 years ago, right?  That is 30 years ago.  So, that was...  CNN was around. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  CNN was late 70s, I think.  They had ESPN, and also, though, like, A&E, but A&E was Arts and Entertainment, and it  was a weird...  It's not like it is now.  No.  All these channels have kind of changed into something else.  It's true.  Yeah, because A&E was...  I don't even remember.  What used to be on A&E?  Arts and Entertainment.  Arts and Entertainment.  Yeah.  And ESPN is Entertainment Sports Programming Network.  So, they weren't just exclusively supposed to be sports, but... 
[01:14:30]  I guess history had history on it.  Yes, history actually had history.  Yeah, I guess ESPN is a niche channel, obviously.  But I'm thinking, like, weather.  It's like...  History finally ran out of Hitler videos, Hitler films.  Right.  And had to...  Yeah.  Actually do other history.  Yeah.  Then they started chasing gators through this outfit.  Right, then for some reason, reality shows took over everything.  But the Weather Channel, absolutely niche and kind of dumb.  Well, it...  The only time the Weather Channel's not dumb is when a hurricane's coming through. 
[01:15:00]  It's true.  And maybe the tornadoes, too, right?  It was pretty handy a while ago.  Like, it went through a phase where everyone laughed about it.  Yeah.  And it was stupid.  Then it kind of got like, all right, you know, I'll turn on the Weather Channel, see what  the fucking weather's going to be.  And now it's kind of obsolete because of the internet.  Yeah.  You know, you pick up your phone, I just go, click, scroll down, there it is, weather.  Yes, satellite maps.  Yeah.  I don't need them. 
[01:15:30]  We pretty much don't need anything anymore.  We really don't need anything.  I was thinking about it yesterday, man.  Why are people going to school still?  Oh, shit.  Now you're saying something crazy.  Think about it.  Think about it.  A.  Don't.  Don't.  A, everything you're learning is already on your phone.  Yeah.  And B, you don't even have to learn it anymore because it's dummy proof.  See, but you wouldn't know that A came before B.  All right, so basic shit. 
[01:16:00]  See?  The only thing school does is forces you to do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You wouldn't do anything.  Yeah.  Unless people forced you to do it.  Why are you teaching people trigonometry?  Because some people might want to become engineers and pilots.  You know what you do?  Yeah.  One week of trigonometry for everybody.  And then the teacher has to focus, have complete focus and point to the kids like, oh, you actually  care about trigonometry.  Well, we're going to move you to the special fucking trigonometry room.  And then everyone else gets to move on to something else. 
[01:16:30]  You guys go to dodgeball.  Jared's going to trig room.  Yeah, you're going to trigonometry.  You are obviously superior.  Let's talk to the teachers.  They know what I'm talking about.  They have a room full of kids that they have to teach trigonometry to knowing that 95%  of the kids, A, don't need it, or B, give a shit.  Or C, get it.  Right.  But there's a couple percent there going, oh, they can point them out.  But don't you think that there's a certain discipline to it and a certain, like, even  though you might not use trigonometry, just the, you know, exercise the brain, kind of 
[01:17:00]  the power to figure things out.  But why not exercise your brain with stuff that you care about?  Well, the stuff you care about might be stuff that other people don't, again, so you're  kind of like, what, put them in history class so one person could like it and the rest  can go, I hate this, put me in trig.  I think we all need a basic understanding of things.  When I was into sociology, I couldn't take a lot of sociology classes because I was too  busy with stupid trigonometry. 
[01:17:30]  Who gives a fuck?  I want to learn about faraway lawns and how the people live.  Dope.  That's dope.  That's what college is for, you know?  College is...  High school is just kind of...  It's the snack pack.  See?  The variety pack.  Yeah, yeah, it's the variety pack.  It's high school.  And then you can get the big, nice box of cereal you like, and that's college.  Yeah, yeah, I'm only eating Frosted Flakes.  I'm majoring in Frosted Flakes.  But why are you memorizing and learning shit?  Sometimes you've got to eat the special cake. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  But why are you memorizing and learning shit when you can look up anything on your phone  now?  Because with the kids, just watching my kids, they go to look something up on their phone  and then they see angry birds.  So you're not really...  And they spin out in that for a while.  That's funny.  What grade do you need to go to?  I think you need...  And then after that, I really believe it starts becoming more of a waste.  I really think that up to...  Ninth grade?  Yeah, high school.  Like, you could do the college thing and get more specific in high school. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah, I could do that.  Start it up then, you know?  Sending kids to college completely doesn't make sense at this point.  Why is that?  Putting them in debt.  Well, yeah.  To get a communications degree.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Maybe if you're going to be, I don't know, a doctor or a lawyer or something or learn a  specific trade, sure.  That's the problem, though.  Basic kids going and getting basic degrees and leaving with this debt?  That's crazy to me.  That's insane.  That is insane.  You really need the people that are going to MIT and doing that, because those scientists 
[01:19:00]  are the ones that are making this microphone and figuring out how to make a bottled water  company.  We need those people.  How do you know that, dope?  The ones that are taking their tops off for a communications degree for four years in Vanderbilt.  You really don't need that.  Well, let's start it with math.  When does math become a waste?  Obviously, you need to add.  You need to subtract.  Multiply.  A little division.  Sure.  A little division.  A little division.  When was the last time you had to fucking do a division problem? 
[01:19:30]  It's true.  Think about it.  So after that, what's the next math after the basics?  I forget.  Algebra.  Algebra.  Do you need algebra?  Algebra.  When was the last time you did an algebra problem?  Geometry.  Well, I'm always looking at variables.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, when you get into math, I'm completely moronic.  I don't.  I kind of checked out mentally in my head when it got to algebra.  And now I really kind of wish someone had been a little more aggressive. 
[01:20:00]  Because I freak out when the pizza guy comes.  I got to do the tip and the change at the same time.  I just go into a panic.  Is that like when the delivery guy comes to the door and he's like, he throws out a number  like it's easy, 20 bucks.  It's like, okay, I got 25 here.  Here you go.  The ideal situation.  It's like, how much?  And he's like, that's a 33.50.  I'm like, okay, 33.  That's 40.  I want to give him five bucks. 
[01:20:30]  Wait a minute.  But that's 40, though.  33.  I'm counting on my fingers.  I just hold that balled up money like I'm from a small town in Belgium.  Take what you need, son.  I ask for no change and he gets five or six bucks tip every time.  I don't give a fuck how big the order is.  It's the same fucking thing.  The roundup.  That's it.  That's true.  Make it easy.  Five or six bucks every time.  Sometimes it's hard to add five dollars.  But what happens when it's just high enough where if it comes in at like 36, 39, 
[01:21:00]  or 37, 39, and then you're giving them 40, and then all of a sudden you're cheating  them, and you've got to look for that extra dollar and change.  Now there's the extra buck.  Yeah.  All at a pin, yes.  I'm rounding off and up at the same time.  Wow.  That's a lot of money.  Think about it.  Up and off.  Say 37.  I'm going, all right, that's 42.  But oh, yeah, there's a little change in there, so I'll just throw another dollar in  there.  Right.  I'll make it really quick.  This is why we don't need trigonometry.  You don't in the end.  I need my tip calculator. 
[01:21:30]  I'm sure the space program was built on the same mathematics.  Yeah, yeah.  Just round it up.  Just round it up.  Yeah.  What's the trajectory we need to intercept our course?  Round it up.  Screw it up in the atmosphere.  Exactly.  Round it up.  How are we going to get into the moon's orbit so it does not explode?  Round it up.  Round it up.  Don't we need some real definite numbers here?  Here's an extra dollar.  Just make it happen.  All right. 
[01:22:00]  I'll wing it.  And Ant didn't graduate high school, and he's a pretty smart motherfucker.  I try, because I learned all by myself.  But you learned a lot on your own, right?  Yes, I did.  Anna says school had a whole conference about kids looking up shit.  So now that's a problem, that the kids are like, if your kid's smart enough to look  up all their shit, then what's the problem?  Is it really smart enough, or is it underhand and crafting?  I think it's pretty smart.  What do you got on this, Anna?  Hi.  I'm a fifth and sixth grade math and science teacher. 
[01:22:30]  Oh.  And we think about the stuff you're saying.  I mean, we say, what are we supposed to teach them if they can look everything up?  And there's a lot they don't know.  Like, they don't know how to do a Google search.  They can't.  They don't.  How do you not know how to do a Google search?  Well, believe me, the questions I get asked on Twitter sometimes, it's like, hey, what's  that thing?  Google it.  Fucking Google it.  They can't.  They're 10.  You know, they can't do it.  So they do learn how.  They need to still learn how to write. 
[01:23:00]  And then they do need some math.  You know, because...  Do you smoke?  Not anymore.  I'm a teacher now.  And you're trying to tell me a 10-year-old doesn't know how to Google?  That's such bullshit.  My kid...  Not efficiently.  I mean, you know...  I got this big remote that, you know, puts my blinds up and down.  My kid is going to be two in a week.  Guess who's opening and closing my blinds now?  That's good.  I didn't teach him.  How the fuck did he figure that out?  And my kid's not a genius, by the way. 
[01:23:30]  I'm not that guy.  All kids are doing this shit.  So you're trying to tell me that they don't know how to Google a 10?  You're crazy.  I have a 10-year-old.  They can Google.  They can Google.  Like how the teacher's yelling over you.  Settle down, show.  Settle down.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not in your fucking classroom.  I'm going to...  I'll talk to you.  Just going to talk.  What do you have to say there, gritty voice girl?  I had a 12-year-old in my house the other day, my nephew.  And he wanted to set up an Xbox.  And he needed cords and shit.  And guess what? 
[01:24:00]  Guess who couldn't figure it out?  Was it me or the 12-year-old?  Oh, shit.  Okay?  So what are you talking about?  These kids know way more than us already.  Way more.  Shut up!  This chick's hilarious.  She's not used to this, right?  No.  You're fucking freaking her out.  She just goes, hey!  Hey!  Raise your hand.  I think you're delusional if you think a 10-year-old doesn't know how to Google.  Yeah.  To be honest with you.  I ask them to do it all the time.  They can Google search anything in my classroom.  And I'm young compared to most teachers. 
[01:24:30]  Most teachers are like 40 years old.  And they're like scared of all the technology.  So, you know, I'm 30 and I let them do this shit.  A lot of teachers don't.  Yeah.  So, you know, and they're like, no, you've got to go to an encyclopedia and all this  stuff.  And that's stupid.  They stopped making encyclopedias.  They did.  Yeah, that's it.  Didn't they stop making...  What did they say the other day?  Encyclopedia Britannica.  Was it the dictionary or the encyclopedia?  They said, yeah, that was it.  Encyclopedia Britannica.  Was it Encyclopedia?  The first time in history.  Stop the prep version.  Yeah, stop making it. 
[01:25:00]  And then apparently they started getting a bunch of orders for them.  Oh, really?  Because people are like, well, they're carrying good.  That's the hoarders out there.  Oh, my God.  I need the last one.  I missed this.  That was a collector's item.  I got the whole collection since 1962.  Does someone want to look up lemurs?  Three out of my four bedrooms are filled with encyclopedias.  Encyclopedia Britannicas.  Oh, yeah, and I have cats in the freezer, too.  Let's not talk about that.  Anything else there, Missy? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, we're bored.  No, but you guys are right, and teachers should be changing, but...  Let's say hi to Scott in Connecticut.  Scott!  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Good morning.  Father Guido Serducci had a bit called the Five-Minute University.  It's pretty cool.  His premise is everything you learned in college, you...  It's about...  In five minutes, you can learn everything that you remember five years after graduating college.  It's pretty funny.  Hmm.  Hmm.  But you're...  You said Father... 
[01:26:00]  Do you know any of the funny parts?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, he talked about his business class where he says the word supply, and all you have  to do is remember to say the word demand after it.  Oh, boy.  We said the funny part.  Wow.  Oh, fuck.  See, we should have stopped you when you said Father Sarducci.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Out of all the SNL characters, guess which one I never got?  Father Guido Sarducci.  And he played the character for 25 fucking years. 
[01:26:30]  From what I hear...  Holy fuck.  Hey, is he still alive, first of all?  I don't know.  Because if he is, from what I hear...  He's still doing it.  He still puts on the outfit and goes along.  And that was one of those things at the original SNL that was kind of like, all right, they're  doing a lot of drugs, and apparently they find this funny, and they put it on.  And people were like, maybe I just don't get it.  I'm not cool enough to get it.  I'm not cool enough to get it.  That's what you felt like.  Like, ah, this guy's great.  I don't get it.  Holy shit, I'm going to be exposed.  Bring back the fat bumblebee. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  I had kids that I grew up with.  They were big Monty Python fans, and I felt that way.  I'm like, I guess...  Right.  I guess my sense of humor hasn't developed yet.  Right, exactly.  I'm not cool enough.  I mean, years go by, and you get some of the Monty Python, but there were kids that were  like, oh, man, this is just amazing.  Why are they crying about the knights that say me?  Yeah.  There was certain things.  I was the same way.  But I had kids that...  Kids, my peers at the time, that lived and died with that shit. 
[01:27:30]  You're like, and I really wanted to be cool like them.  It was the same way.  Oh, you were?  Okay.  I was like, all right, it's kind of funny, but why are these guys wetting their pants?  Yeah, they were just crying and fucking quoting it.  Yeah.  I'm the knights that say me.  Really?  And that's funny.  That was one of those things, man.  If you, you know, you were too cool for the room.  They were quoting it every line.  And I would just try, and I just never fully understood the whole thing.  A lot of fake laughing in those times. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just to be like, I better laugh.  Oh, they would be on to me.  They would have viewing parties.  Oh, we're going to hang out this weekend and watch Monty Python.  Yeah.  And maybe sneak a few beers into my mom's house.  And I'd sit around drinking the beer going, holy fuck.  I don't know.  It was the same mentality.  That was like before Comic-Con ever hit.  This is the only place that personality could channel.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was into Monty Python.  Yeah, you watch Monty Python and try to figure out why it's funny. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  Some of the stuff was funny.  No, I got it.  I got it years later, but I was way too fucking young to be on that same level as these kids.  And even on the same level, though, they were obsessed.  They were like...  Faulty Towers?  I was like, there's nothing this funny.  I liked Faulty Towers.  Faulty Towers was great.  Yeah.  But that was another one that they really got into.  But did you ever have anything in your life that you thought was so funny that you just quoted it for like a whole year? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I never got...  I was always like, yeah, that's great.  I love it.  Caddyshack was one for me.  Yeah, but you didn't quote him.  Well, for the show, maybe.  But, you know, we're on the radio.  We have to quote things.  Make the clock tick by.  Scott from Connecticut.  He still there?  Yeah.  He is.  This is the Father Sarducci guy.  Hoping we were going to come back to him.  Boom.  All right, Scott.  Wow.  Thank you, sir.  Should have been hung up on.  The nights that say me. 
[01:29:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Why do they say that?  And why is it funny?  I think we should get that teacher fired that if she really believes that 10-year-olds can't Google.  Maybe she meant effectively.  Yeah, she thinks she's all important in the front of the class, writing stuff.  She doesn't realize every kid in there has a phone with a Wi-Fi connection, and they're looking at porn and doing whatever they want to do behind their back.  I have my virtual teacher right here in my pocket.  But if we all have smartphones where we can look up anything, how do you prove your intelligence? 
[01:30:00]  Because if you're talking about something, I could go, oh, fuck, man.  I want in on this conversation.  How about we raise smart people instead of smart phones?  I think that is a real question for education.  I completely, when my wife asks me a question, I just look at her like, why are you asking me?  Look it up.  Look it up.  Look it up.  There were some things you would never know unless you went to the library.  Like, there was shit.  You'd be at home and go, I really want to know what that is and know about that. 
[01:30:30]  You look around your house, you're like, there's nothing in here that will inform me of what I need to know or want to know.  I have to go to the library and get a book about this and read it.  But take time out of my day.  But then what would happen when you went to the library?  Let's be honest.  I would go to the photography section and look for nude pictures of women.  Of course you would.  Of course.  In the photography section.  You'd get these giant photo books and just thumb through them.  Okay, nudes.  Great.  I'm here.  And then if you were real desperate, you would just look up dirty words and read. 
[01:31:00]  Well, you could do that, too.  That used to be a little titillating.  I used to take the photography books back to the table with other books.  Yeah.  And I'd find, like, a good picture, right?  And then I'd shut the book, kind of, but I'd be grabbing the page that the good picture was on.  And I'd make it look like I was reading another book while I slowly was ripping the picture out of the photography book.  Because I wanted that picture to take home and enjoy. 
[01:31:30]  There's nothing funnier than the slow rip.  The slow rip, because I didn't want to.  And occasionally, if the paper was too loud, yeah.  Anything worse than being turned on to some, like, some nasty shit in a book, and then you do go to the library?  Yeah.  And you look it up, and some asshole, like you, got there before you and ripped it out.  Like, fuck.  And you know it's your friend.  I was very good at ripping out the dirty pictures and folding, like, folding them, but not putting the folds on the good part. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  Like, you can't just fold a picture of a nudie up.  Anything better than having a fold, dirty picture in your back pocket for later?  The fucking after-dinner mint.  Oh, I would be walking home from the library literally going.  You can feel it in your back pocket.  Oh, when I get home, oh, me and her are going to be together.  Nobody knows.  Nobody knows.  What I got in my back pocket right now. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's filthy.  It usually was when you went to someone else's house who had the cool dad who had the Playboy subscription, and then you would fucking grab a couple of those pages for later.  Oh, my God.  And you could, that was the thing, like, now, like, a kid will have all this porn on their phone.  They can fly through anything.  We had relationships.  Like, you had one magazine with, you learned who that girl was.  She was with you for a couple years.  And you got tired of her.  After a while, you're like, boy, I wish I found another magazine. 
[01:33:00]  I think we're going to have to break up.  But there was one.  There was a girl.  DM the magazine.  This blonde on this, like, red raft.  I can still see it.  You can see it today, right?  I still see it.  Oh, really?  Oh, every time.  It's just like, oh, there she is again.  Hello.  Hello, Candy.  Yeah.  Hello, Candy.  With an eye.  Hello, Candy.  Now, I mean, I couldn't imagine.  Fucking video.  The hardcore porn video is available to everybody. 
[01:33:30]  For free.  For free.  It's just there.  And to, like, that, just imagine a moving fucking picture back then.  Oh, my God.  It was crazy.  If you turned the page of a Playboy or Penthouse and the pictures were similar, so it almost  looked like her leg was moving in some wacky flip animation thing, it was like, oh, it's  like she's moving.  It's alive.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  Now it's just like, ah, you know what?  I think I'm going to look at handjobs today.  Right.  I'm just going to look at chicks giving dudes handjobs. 
[01:34:00]  And then I'll go to fucking, you know what?  I'm going to go to fetish.  And then I'll go to flute practice.  Yeah.  It really is astounding.  And the teacher's like, these kids don't know how to Google.  They don't know how to Google.  No, they know how to Google.  They don't Google trigonometry.  No.  But they Google trig.  Pass play.  Oh.  Rocky Horror, the same as Monty Python.  We had the Rocky Horror people in my school.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  They had to go to the midnight shows and stuff. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  You know what?  Fuck it.  Bring the water guns.  I never got Rocky Horror.  No, enough.  I never understood why that was so great.  Kind of amusing.  Kind of amusing.  Kind of amusing.  That's not worthwhile of going every weekend on Friday and bringing toast and fucking water  guns.  Doing the dances.  Doing the dances.  Dressing up like the characters.  Oh, God.  Man.  It's so great.  And then we get to this part.  Everybody shoots water pistols in the air.  Shut up.  It's great.  You know, I come here every week dressed like Frank and Furter. 
[01:35:00]  And, you know, I have a family here.  And then we go to the ride.  Oh, really?  Are you?  Yeah, that's all I hear.  It's just a jump to the lift.  Oh.  Every time they would explain it to me, I just kept thinking, at what point do you get laid?  Right.  Does it ever end with your penis entering a vagina? 
[01:35:30]  Because if not, I'm going to get a six-pack and try and hook up with it.  Yeah.  I'm going to go into the woods where, you know, next to my house where I know people are partying.  Something might really happen to me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God, I never got that.  That's hilarious.  That's all you hear.  Yeah.  Put your hands on your hips.  Let's say hi to John.  We actually got another teacher with this Google shit. 
[01:36:00]  John, go ahead, buddy.  Yeah, listen.  All right?  I'm a teacher in the state.  All right?  I teach a class that uses computers.  All right?  Like, you know, like surgeons and stuff to help them write their research papers.  All right?  I teach them how to write research papers.  So when they go to college, they don't fail out.  All right?  Right.  You give them Google.  You give them Google.  Yeah.  All right?  You give them Google.  Maybe you should teach your kids that you shouldn't end every sentence with.  All right?  All right?  Go ahead.  All right?  All right.  Go ahead.  What's up?  Yep. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  You give them Google.  You say, okay, look up this.  They do it, and they just give you the bare bones of it.  They can't explain it in their own words.  They can't put their own two cents in it.  It's just like, here it is.  This is it.  And they have no say in it.  It's garbage.  This isn't even the right version. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, this is the what problem?  Why isn't this the right version?  The only thing that was kind of amusing for me...  Are you busy?  The only thing that was kind of amusing for me is when I learned that meatloaf...  ...was in it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like, okay, that made it amusing.  Amusing.  We got a guy.  We've done this bit, but it's always fun.  We'll go to Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy, go ahead, sir.  Good morning, boys.  You know, I was lucky.  I had two older brothers. 
[01:37:30]  My brother, John, showed me my first nude, which was Bobby Benton and Playboy.  Bobby Benton, amazing Playboy.  A classic.  Yes.  Timeless, except for the bush.  That's great.  I love this.  78 there.  You had the bush back then.  And then my mother used to get, like, these books in a month.  And there was one that came in called Origins by, like, Leakey.  Like, these two, like, guys, anthropologists.  Yeah.  I think that book is a child.  And I always looked at the African women with the big African titties.  And I considered to hump pillows. 
[01:38:00]  That's what I did back then.  I didn't know it.  I humped a pillow or two in my day.  Sometimes you stack the pillows.  It's even better.  Yeah, you're a four and a half, and you're the old pillow hump.  Yeah, I pillow humped.  What the hell?  I never got the pillow hump.  You never pillow humped?  I never got the pillow hump.  I didn't do the job.  With the picture up near the wall there?  Like you were with her?  Ah, maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Center folds there.  Heads were just a little too small, but almost proportionate to what you were doing.  So you're like, oh. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, baby.  Gentlemen, my brother Johnny also had that commemorative Hustler edition with the girl wearing the American flag.  It was the old scratch and sniff centerfold.  Oh, the scratch and sniff centerfold in Hustler.  I do remember that.  Yes, yes.  I humped a pillow or two to that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now you just troll, like in the middle of the night.  I said, fucking, I'm married now 11 years.  I'm a paycheck with a penis.  My wife doesn't use the penis.  And now I am walking myself in the basement, a poor MD, just putting in anything. 
[01:39:00]  Midget, okay, let's wipe off the midget.  It's fucking pathetic, and I'm punching out.  Wow, what a mess.  Was this guy a teacher?  Yeah, that was all about Googling.  And what was the thing? 
[01:39:30]  It was like, it would say something and everybody would respond in the audience.  Oh, you have to talk back to the screen when they say things.  Why?  Why do you have to do that?  There was like a thing.  I'm not black.  Well, you have to.  Those people do that.  Don't.  Yeah, there was that thing, like they would say something on the screen.  It was almost like drinking during New Heart.  Right, yeah, yeah.  They would have to say the same thing.  They would have to say the same thing.  It was like a, it was a whole thing that they would act out.  And then, oh yes, and then certain people, you know, especially, there was a whole hierarchy 
[01:40:00]  too.  Right, exactly.  So the people that were like the good people dressed up would stand in front of the screen  and act the movie out as the movie was fucking playing.  And they'd get so into it, and they were like stars.  They were like fucking stars.  How did that all happen?  I don't fucking know.  When did it go past just being a movie?  This is really before, there was no nerd outlet at the time.  It really, it's like now you can go to comic books, you can go to Comic Con, you have video 
[01:40:30]  games.  Back then, all that energy went into that.  I remember watching Rocky Horror the first time on like Cinema 100, back in the first days  of cable television.  And it was, you know, every so often they'd pop a movie on, and late night was Rocky Horror  because there were a couple of tits in it and stuff, which was pretty exciting.  But I'd never got it or really liked the whole thing.  It was kind of weird, like you said, mildly amusing.  Right, exactly.  I would love to see...  Susan Sarandon was pretty hot in it. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, well.  Old golf ball eyes.  Oh, the fan club.  I would love to find the first porno site.  I backed it to.  I think that'd be very stimulating.  Oh, man.  The first porno site.  I remember Cinema 100, like Anne's talking about, and there was one they played all the  time, and it was all just fairy tales.  Fairy tales was the one.  Was it called fairy tales?  Yeah.  If I found that, I would be, I would have an instant fucking boner.  It was a movie called fairy tales. 
[01:41:30]  Because it would bring me right back, man.  That was like, holy fuck, this is heaven.  It's like your first girlfriend.  I saw the guy.  And it probably is a shitty fucking...  Oh, it's terrible.  It's probably terrible, but this is one of the first things I ever whacked off to.  The guy that stars in it?  Yeah.  I saw him recently in a Cadillac commercial.  How would you know that?  I don't know.  I just...  Things like that stick with me.  See, look at the girls.  Ugly.  It was like a musical porno.  This is like something that Burt Reynolds' character in Boogie Nights would have made. 
[01:42:00]  No, I'm pretty sure this is it.  This was on Cinema 100?  Yeah.  I don't remember all the singing.  Yeah, it was a musical.  Nah, man.  Then I'm thinking of something else that had a fairy tale theme.  I don't remember this, to be honest with you.  I don't remember this part.  I do remember the part with the midget.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  That's the guy right there.  Queen's box?  Yes.  And after the king's ball comes off, we're eating dinner in the queen's box. 
[01:42:30]  He wound up being...  I saw him in like an episode of Three's Company.  It's more like a box lunch.  You mean there'll be more than you do?  They're doing double entendre?  Yeah, box lunch.  Wow, that girl's really getting it to the right of what we're watching.  Yeah, right?  You're watching some bad softcore porno.  That girl literally being ass-pounded and put a fuck in the window.  Showing her goods in the water.  It is slutload.com, so...  He's just emptying a bottle of water in her asshole.  What the fuck? 
[01:43:00]  Wow.  This is what happened, though.  This is what happened.  It started with this, and now we're...  And now look at where we are.  The costumes and the story.  Yeah.  What do you do on a hot night with a what?  In Wonderland.  In Wonderland.  Like an Alice in Wonderland.  I don't remember all this singing.  It was all a musical.  The whole thing was a musical.  All right.  Captain Kangaroos in it.  There was this, and there was Cheerleaders, which was the one where...  Cheerleaders we joke about.  We were doing Cheerleaders lines at Cleveland.  In Cleveland.  What have we got here? 
[01:43:30]  Well, what have we got here?  It was always the father that was just minding his own business, watching TV late night,  and his daughter's friend had to come downstairs to get a drink of water or something.  Yeah.  But she was in tiny nothing outfits.  Oh, hi, Mr. Jones.  I'm just getting out.  And he'd be sitting there, oh.  And he'd be, what have we got here?  Well, why don't you come sit down and talk for a while?  Is it time for practice?  Yeah.  Oh.  Always so surprised that the girl was coming in. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Lots of great fucking hairy bushes in that one.  Who was the broad?  She was very big in the soft corn industry when we were growing up.  Soft corn?  Soft corn, excuse me.  With the big, huge, over-the-top, fake, fucking tight boobs.  I don't remember any of their names.  She had kind of like an ethnic look to her.  Just slightly.  Oh, is this it?  No more hot dogs. 
[01:44:30]  I got bored with the kids.  Wait, who's this?  Well, sit down there.  Oh, it's choppy.  Oh, it's choppy.  That's too bad.  What have we got here?  The chick's sitting on his lap.  He doesn't know what's happening.  I got bored with the kids.  Well, you better sit down there.  Yes, you are sitting down.  He's winning.  Oh, well, it's pretty tight now, but the halfback just hit the end with a button hook. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, does that mean he hooked his buttons?  Uh, no, not exactly.  It's, uh, it's where he starts on a fly pattern and then goes down and in.  And then the rest of the movie is them fucking the whole other team so that their team wins.  Jesus Christ.  They seem so much nicer to each other.  Yeah.  See, the cheerleaders had to go to the opposing school, fuck the team so they'd be tired,  and that's their team would win.  Is this the coach getting it? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Then the coach gets it.  Wow.  And they lose the game?  Well.  Yeah.  Well.  Well, what have we got here?  Oh, yeah.  Is that Hotsy Totsy?  All right.  Well, we certainly could Google this shit on their own.  Well, see?  Yes, you can Google that on your own.  So that's your assignment, class.  Yes, class.  You won't find that.  You won't find that.  You won't find that.  You won't find that.  You won't find that.  You won't find that.  You won't find that.  You won't find that. 
[01:46:00]  I'll never hear that the same way again.  Oh, this is what it was.  Oh, is that?  When there's a guide to going to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  A guide to going to the Rocky Horror.  For you first-timers that don't really know what's happening.  Can you just Google this, Tom Papa?  Yeah.  And when you hear the name Brad Majors, everyone would yell, asshole.  Remember that?  Asshole.  Right, because he was an asshole.  Brad Majors and the whole crowd would yell, asshole.  Asshole.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That's really going crazy.  That is crazy.  Yelling asshole.  That's edgy.  Whoa. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, God.  Every time people would, oh, we're going to go, we're going to see it on Friday  nights at midnight.  And I would just sit there and think, well, no one, there's no chance for me to get action  at this at all.  Oh, none.  Let's go.  Are they still doing it somewhere?  Oh, they have to be.  They're still doing it in New York.  In New York.  Where?  Oh, Christ.  Downtown, like 14th.  Let's go to one of these.  Like that.  Let's go.  Oh, let's go.  Fucking an ex took me there once.  Really? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  I just sat there like, oh, God.  I thought it was before DMs.  Recently?  No, no.  It was a while ago.  This was Melinda.  No, when you said that, I thought it might have been her.  Yeah, yeah.  And I went and I was like, you know, okay.  Did she like it?  Yeah, she wasn't jumping up and doing it, but she like was into it and stuff.  And I'm just kind of sitting there like, oh, God, this blows.  This blows.  Yeah, on 23rd Street. 
[01:47:30]  23rd.  Every Friday and Saturday.  All right.  Every Friday and Saturday.  Still.  God.  Who's doing this?  Oh.  And stop it.  I always love running into the people on the way there.  On the way there in like 7-Eleven.  Like, he's picking up some smokes.  Dressed in their stupid costume.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Can I have a pack of Marlboro?  You gotta assume it's a lot of older people going at this point, no?  I would think so.  Trying to relive what they were brought up with.  Yeah, I don't see that this is really kind of catching on with the younger folk. 
[01:48:00]  Maybe not.  No.  I don't know.  Current cast?  Wait, what the fuck?  I think these are the people who act out the movie in front of the screen.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  They have pictures of them on the website?  Like, they're really people doing things?  Yeah.  They're like headshot.  One guy's got like a headshot.  Who's Grayson?  Oh, no.  Wow, this guy.  I'm gonna bet.  I'm Grayson.  This guy gets a lot of dick. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, it's so sad being an actor.  Man.  Why would you do that pose ever with the thumb on the cheek?  Oh, my God.  Here it is.  Why?  Rust your hand resting on your chin.  I'm the thinking man's comedy.  I'm the thinking man's acting.  He plays Eddie, which was Meat Loaf's part.  And he goes, first time I saw Rocky Hara on a VHS in my older brother's collection.  Thought it was stupid.  Then with some buddies from my old acting school. 
[01:49:00]  Still thought it was stupid.  Then in 2008 with college friends and fell in love.  Oh, boy.  Anyway, why I joined, I've been an actor all my life.  And I've been a fan since 2008.  I'd attempted to start a shadow cast on my college campus, but that never fell through.  Never fell through?  It's never panned out or it fell through.  Right.  Dummy.  So when I was in my last semester, I joined the New York cast.  And it was the best decision I ever made. 
[01:49:30]  Because I realized I'm really not an actor.  I'm not an actor.  Haven't been my whole life.  Get another pretentious shithead picture that I could read there fucking.  Okay.  This guy.  He doesn't have anything.  I'm going to pretend along with a movie.  Dr. Scott is black?  Oh, this guy looks cool.  Eric, he plays Riff.  Oh.  All right.  And Rocky.  He's played Rocky, too.  Whoa.  First time I saw it at a friend's house when I was like 15 years old.  Turned it off after Sweet Tea. 
[01:50:00]  Because I thought it was just a little weird and didn't like it.  Oh, how times have changed.  Oh, yes, Eric.  Why I joined.  Well, originally, I was a member of what?  Sins Oh the Flesh in L.A.  Where I joined because Bernie, cast leader at the time, said I had no choice.  Yeah, said I had no choice.  I needed a Rocky.  Six years later, when I moved to New York City, Tom said I had to join because, well, I had no choice. 
[01:50:30]  See, spun that.  No choice or no career?  No career whatsoever.  This is terrible.  Could you imagine calling yourself an actor and your gig is, a movie is playing with real actors.  Yeah.  And you are mimicking it along the way.  And you're mimicking it and you think you should have a bio and fucking headshots.  They want to kill themselves, I would assume.  All of their instincts where this movie sucks the first time. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Stick with your initial instinct.  And going back to the porn real fast.  Yeah.  Because they checked the Twitter.  Yeah.  Cinderella, I think it was called.  Oh, there was a Cinderella.  Look up Cinderella.  There was a Cinderella.  Drew Barg and many other people, thank you.  And the porn star I was thinking of that was kind of a bit ethnic.  Yeah.  But not too much was Del Rio.  Del Rio?  I believe that might be right as well.  I watched Del Rio on the Kuno and na-na. 
[01:51:30]  Na-na-na-na-na-na.  Cinderella.  Vanessa Del Rio?  Yes.  I think it was Del Rio.  Oh, well.  You can look up Del Rio.  We don't need a clip from...  Well, I guess we do need a clip from Cinderella.  Cinderella.  I watched Del Rio.  Porn.  Oh, Del Rio is going to be tough because there's an actress named Vanessa Del Rio.  Oh.  And that's not the porn actress?  How about you put Del Rio takes cock in Google?  You know what? 
[01:52:00]  Gets right.  It filters out a lot of stuff.  You obviously went to school.  Thank you.  See?  People are pointing out that Sam doesn't know how to work to Google, so you're trying  to say that 10-year-old's there?  Sam is very bad at the Google.  I've found every movie so far.  Nah, you're pretty bad at it.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  I've found every movie so far.  Well, how about you Google it?  Just go with images with Del Rio.  Let's see what comes up.  Maybe some old trouble fucking happens.  I've found every movie so far.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah. 
[01:52:30]  Nah.  Nah.  What's Bernie Mac doing up there?  Oh, man.  Google images is so weird.  It really is.  It just turns up a cavalcade of what the fuck.  Yeah?  No?  Nah.  That's not her?  I don't even know if that's her now.  I don't know, because Del Rio taking a lot of cock.  A lot of cock.  That's not the one I remember.  A lot of cock and a Cub Scout.  Yeah, and then a Cub Scout.  She had big, huge fucking silicone. 
[01:53:00]  It's going to give her cancer tits.  Oh.  When they didn't figure that shit out.  The old school.  Yes.  Oil residue.  Yeah.  Leaking into her system.  An oil spill throughout her body.  Right.  Right.  Wildlife being killed inside her core.  She almost looked like Charro.  Help me out.  Oh, really?  A little bit.  Maybe it was a dream you had.  Nah.  I remember Cinderella, too. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, Cinderella.  Yeah, this was another one.  Cinderella got some things done.  Used to play on the Cinema 100.  It was a big box that went on your television with one switch.  And you got regular cable TV.  Uh-huh.  And then you got the special Cinema 100 movie channel.  One channel.  One movie channel.  They would send a guide out every month for the whole month's movies.  Uh-huh.  And it was like the same movies would play the entire month, just at different times.  Wow.  So 8.30 p.m., you'd get like Grey Lady Down with David Carradine as a submarine guy. 
[01:54:00]  And you'd get some softcore pornography.  Uh-huh.  Oh, look at that.  A big hairy bush.  The bushes are getting tangled.  Come on.  They'd play this nice little music.  And this is when girls were going at it.  Just girl on girl.  Everyone was so nice, though.  They were very nice.  I like this much better.  This isn't the smacker in the face while she's choking on your cock video.  Yeah, what happened?  This is all nice. 
[01:54:30]  Why did we need that?  It's all attack porn now.  It's attack porn.  Why did we need that?  It really is.  I'm looking at this.  This is nice.  This is nice.  They love each other.  I'm enjoying this.  They're being cool to each other.  Yeah.  Their bodies are nice.  Yeah.  They're just things happening.  They're gently.  She is gently kissing and caressing her ass and her belly now.  Now they're laying together very sensuously.  Nowadays, they'd be pounding each other with a fucking dildo shaped like a fist.  Right.  Spitting on each other. 
[01:55:00]  Spitting in each other's mouths.  Everyone looks pissed.  Ass licking.  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  I think we have to go old school.  Yeah.  Why can't people be nice about it?  It's this nice, sensual kind of porn that's going on here.  What's this guy doing?  Then the creepy guy on the corner.  Is that your dad, Sam?  That guy.  But that's the 70 porn star mustache.  That guy represents future porn.  Yes.  That's the things to come. 
[01:55:30]  I was thinking, you know what this situation needs?  Someone being slapped.  And I got the kag.  Someone being slapped around.  Yeah, man, look.  The music is nice.  The music is nice.  She's not getting choked.  Yeah.  No, no choking.  Taking care of each other.  Right.  No big, no guy going, you suck my fucking cock.  Just smacking her face.  Writing cunt on her forehead.  Right.  Exactly.  This is beautiful.  This is when you used to be with somebody because you liked them.  Yeah.  See, but right next to it, you know, there's an advertisement for, you know, Peter Griffin fucking having sex with his daughter. 
[01:56:00]  Right.  Great.  See?  Right.  Exactly.  What happened?  Toon porn.  Look, Peter Griffin is having sex with Meg.  Right.  That's good.  She's jumping up and down on his dick.  Because that's what we need now.  Yeah.  But look at this gentle massaging.  Caressing.  They're taking their time.  The breasts.  Caressing is a lost art.  They're kissing each other and slowly gyrating.  Yeah.  And gyrating is getting a little more.  This is amazing. 
[01:56:30]  The slow fades.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I like that.  No quick cuts to the pool side where some woman's on a rotisserie.  She's getting railed in the asshole and mouth.  Exactly.  And pussy.  Oh, pussy.  There's just five dicks in her.  No.  This is just...  I saw a guy pouring a water bottle down a girl's asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about that?  Look.  Look at the guy.  He's just taking...  Even the guy.  The guy's more gentle than the girl.  Look.  The guy's just slowly stroking it.  He's wearing a necklace.  What's his name?  Fucking...  Well, wait a minute.  Who did...  What's his name that O.J. killed? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, fucking...  Furman.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  Mark Furman?  No, not Mark Furman.  The father.  Yeah.  I forgot the father's name.  I know.  I just got a complete mental block.  That sucks.  I can't wait for you.  Someone will pop it up soon.  All right.  We don't need the fucking acting.  Pearlman.  Yes.  Yeah, but everybody liked...  Sex was a fun thing you shared with a friend.  Yeah.  It wasn't something that you took out all of your aggression.  She's just hurting. 
[01:57:30]  Porn now is like watching a karate video.  You're so right.  Yeah.  World star hip-hop.  Just some chick being punched in the face.  It's like, yeah, suck my dick.  Yeah, I'm going to take out all of my lifelong aggression out during sex.  No.  I don't know.  How did it turn to that?  Goldman.  Ron Goldman.  Ron Goldman.  Pearlman. 
[01:58:00]  Ron Perlman.  That's hilarious.  Why don't we take a break?  Tom Pop is here, and Tom's promoting that his new CD is on iTunes.  Oh.  What's the name of it, Tom again?  Tom Pop alive in New York City.  Nice.  Very cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Put your hands on your hips.  To the left.  To the left.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  With your ass hole.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  And everybody goes, and it's midnight, and everybody, and you bring glitter, and you bring 
[01:58:30]  a little water and stuff, but you've got to know the right moves.  You've got to do it when everybody else does it.  It's your first time here.  Don't fuck it up.  Don't fuck it up.  You've got to do it.  Just follow me.  Just follow me.  Well, you're like you vouched for someone, and if they fuck up, it's like the mob.  Right.  I vouched for this fucking riffraff.  Where's his water pistol?  He threw the toast at the wrong time.  You've got to bring toast?  Yeah, and then when they say a toast or something, everyone throws literally white toast. 
[01:59:00]  I feel bad for the guy that's got to pick up the toast every night.  He doesn't care.  He loves it.  You think he loves picking up toast every night?  Oh, my God.  Here comes my favorite part.  When they say, Brad, you've got to yell, asshole.  Oh, here he comes.  Ass hole.  Oh, this is so great.  We're totally doing this again next Friday.  Yes.  And next Friday.  And next Friday.  See you all next Friday, guys.  See ya.  Hey, can we try it for the porn star again, please?  I'm obsessed.  Matt might have a lead on the porn star I'm talking about from back in the day. 
[01:59:30]  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Please, Matt, help me out.  Fox News Alert.  Huh?  Hey, I think the actress you're looking for, I think her name is Kitty Navarro or Kitten Navarro.  All right, let's go with this.  Kitten Navarro.  That sounds familiar.  I think she was in a film called Taking It Off.  Played guitar for the Chili Peppers for a little bit, as a matter of fact, as I recall.  Imagine it's Dave's fucking mom.  Dave's fucking mother.  That'd be funny.  Oh, man.  Kitty Navarro. 
[02:00:00]  A lot of kittens.  Meow.  It says Kitten Navidad.  Oh, man.  People say Kitten Navidad.  Another dead end.  Fuck.  Put it in Navidad.  Navidad.  Navidad.  Yeah, you asshole.

Well, it's on X Hamster.  That's Natividad.  What's with this fucking guy?  I don't want to see this fucking guy. 
[02:00:30]  Come on.  There's a chick.  There she is.  Ew.  That might be her.  Oh, God.  Oh, B.  No, that's her little mess.  Oh, B.  What a disaster.  Get the fuck out of here.  God, her tits are fucking disgusting.  She stayed in the business a little too long.  Oh, B.  Let me see.  You need help.  That's her.  Oh, my God.  That's what you like.  That's what you like.  I'm old.  Shut the fuck up.  Whatever you're into.  Whatever you're into, dude.  Oh, my God.  I did not picture you.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  Look at her bush. 
[02:01:00]  Thank you, man.  That's fucking her.  She's got giant tits and a bush.  God, she stayed in the business too long.  That's a cute shot.  That's a cute shot.  Real cute shot.  Wow.  They can't even grow hair like that anymore if they wanted to.  No.  Evolution took care of the pussy hair.  It's a trip.  Yeah, I don't even think they can do that.  I don't think a girl could grow like that.  It literally does not grow in those spots anymore.  How did it happen in 20 years?  That's impossible.  It's halfway down her legs.  There was some evolutionary thing.  It starts at her belly button. 
[02:01:30]  Show some more younger pictures of her.  Let's see what the fuck was going on.  This was absolutely her.  Oh, we cracked the code.  Come on.  Sam.  Sam.  Pop something up for fuck.  She obviously stayed in the business for a long fucking time.  A little too long.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Look at that.  That's an old school vagina right there.  That is.  That's like a car park.  Yeah.  It's all perfect.  I don't think they could even grow hair on the sides like that anymore.  Yeah.  I don't think so, man.  I don't know.  We ought to have a fucking contest, man.  I want to. 
[02:02:00]  We should have a contest.  Dirtiest pussy, right?  Just girls.  What?  Give them a start date.  Give them a start date to grow their fucking pussy hair.  We do want a smelly bush contest.  Well, yeah.  We want it badly.  Where the girls can even fucking do whatever they have to to make it dirty.  And then they come in a few weeks later, and we try to see who grew the biggest fucking  hairiest mangy bush.  Sure.  Yeah, just let it go.  Wild style.  Let it go crazy.  No Italians allowed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's cheating.  That is cheating.  Come on, Sam.  Like, how about that? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, that's definitely her, though, man.  She's fucked.  She's fun.  I want nothing to do with any girl that looks like that.  She looks like a lot of fun.  I'm just saying, back in the day, though, she was in a lot of those Cinema 100 plays.  If you had a big mustache, you'd like that.  Oh, yeah.  Big, fat, fucking Johnny the Wad.  Let's do the time.  Do we have an actual scene from one of her movies?  Oh, now you're asking him to perform Miracle School.  No, he showed the one where it looks like she did it last week. 
[02:03:00]  Yuck.  Yeah.  We don't want to see films from her comeback.  Oh, God.  She has to hold her tits up.  Look at what she's doing.  She's on her back.  She has to hold under her tits, or they will fall off her chest like two blobs of mercury.  Are those real?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Her vibrator just came out of the wall.  Oh, no.  She stayed in way too long.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  She's angry at it.  She's really angry that it unplugs.  How about you just plug it back in?  Oh, she's still got, like, a hairy butt.  Oh, she's...  It looks like someone's mom getting off the couch.  Wow.  She is horrid.  This is horrible.  Oh, my God.  This is really terrible.  I don't know what to fucking make of this.  No, but...  This is what you were into?  Not...  Not this.  Opie, this is disgusting.  This is terrible.  You've got to be ashamed of yourself.  She stayed in the business.  This is like the mom that you would never even think about making you watch her.  Nick, the massager you sold me doesn't work. 
[02:04:00]  It just fell on the way.  Great acting, though.  I didn't do anything to it.  She looks like she's an extra on Sesame Street.  I don't have time to go in there.  I don't have time.  That's good.  Yeah, that's good acting.  I'm surprised Hollywood didn't call for legitimate roles.  For a fucking...  For Tor Johnson.  Yeah.  She is a disaster.  This is really terrible.  This was filmed a mere... 
[02:04:30]  I'm going back a while.  I think she works the register at Christides.  Look at the guy's hair.  Obviously, it was a long time ago.  Yeah.  He's got a mullet, so we're...  All right.  She stayed in it until the 80s.  Those are real boobs.  90s.  Those are real...  All right.  Could you go to when she was maybe younger?  Jesus Christ.  I don't know if youth is going to help this.  No.  No.  Here's her a little younger.  God, I was into boobs back then.  Boobs mafia.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:05:00]  You were all about the boobs.  No.  This is even too late in her career.  She was pretty experienced.  If she goes back, I mean, she would have to completely change for you to like her.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got big sloppy tits.  Yeah.  Classic porn box.  Wow.  No.  She's too old there, too.  You are in some crazy sites.  Yeah, you've really fallen into this fucking back lot of porno sites.  No turning back now.  I don't know what these are. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  I hope we left a trail of cum so we can find our way out.  I hope we have enough kerosene to keep this light on.  We are deep into the internet here.  Something smells like batshit.  Yeah.  We can all get arrested if we continue.  I think we should just stop.  I don't know where this leads.  I hope somebody told their loved ones where we were headed.  Yeah.  There was a reason we went this deep into the internet.  We have to chew our own arm off to get out of here. 
[02:06:00]  We are deep, deep into the intertubes.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello.  Anthony, Anthony.  Hello.  Oh, man.  God, her asshole looks like she didn't wipe.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  She's a fucking disaster.  There are stalagmites all around us right now.  Oh, yeah.  I dare not go any further.  Yeah.  Why don't we...  I think we should turn around.  Nobody has been this deep.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah, let's do that.  Let's call for a search.  Someone shoot up a flare and get us out of here. 
[02:06:30]  I so wish we didn't find this broad.  I know, yeah.  I remember it very differently.  Your memory is ruined.  I have memories.  I remember it very differently.  Your memory is open.  She's got a truck driver's ass.  Oh, God.  We're learning a lot about your development right now.  Her ass looks like it had been hit with a hatchet.  And that's a giant pussy area.  Like she gave birth to a rhino or something.  Wow.  It looks like my friend's father's ass.  Getty Lee is fucking up. 
[02:07:00]  That's it.  Oh, my God.  Today's time to start getting high on you.  And she's...  Spits you and being gonna buy on you.  He's pounding her in the ass.  She's playing with herself.  She must be really bored after that many years.  I think a baby kangaroo is gonna pop out.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is bad. 
[02:07:30]  That's a world of hurt down there.  The Rocky Horror guy is gonna pop out.  Yeah, start singing.  It'd be great.  Tom Papa on the Twitter.  We will continue.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPNN3 Show.  I did it.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  Did it.  Oh, fuck.  Tom Papa, man. 
[02:08:00]  We had a little discussion.  You went to the bathroom.  Me and Tom Papa were getting into this Money Python thing a little further.  Because growing up, you know, the cool kids around you were watching this Money Python,  this highbrow shit.  And I knew when we were having the discussion that I wanted to bring something else to it.  And I forgot until we went to commercial.  It just shows you what kind of person I was.  There were these people with their highbrow humor watching Money Python and really getting it. 
[02:08:30]  And you just don't understand.  And what I was watching back then was stupid Benny Hill.  Oh, wow.  That doesn't say it all.  That was the lowbrow.  Cruising around on these little tricycles.  Big-breasted nurses chasing him around in fast motion.  That's all I needed.  Yeah.  Oh, you just, you just don't get it.  You look, he's patting the old guy on the top of the head again.  Right, right.  You like the three stooges of the English.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, and they were both out at the same time, I do believe.  Yeah.  And then Tom Papa's saying to me, what were some of those other Money Python skits that, you know. 
[02:09:00]  That people would obsess over.  And I said, I don't know, there was that, like, I don't know, it's called Foundation of Silly Walks.  The Ministry.  No, I know, but then he looked it up.  The Ministry of Silly Walks.  And I remember I had my friend at the time, Gary.  I lost touch with him a long fucking time ago.  But he loved that skit, practiced it, learned some of the walks, and then couldn't wait  to show us.  All right, that's embarrassing.  And then I'm sitting there like, I guess I'm supposed to laugh because everyone else is 
[02:09:30]  laughing.  Yeah, look, there's a silly walk.  Yeah.  John Cleese is doing his silly walk.  The Ministry of Silly Walk.  And it was funny, but not to, like, live your life imitating it.  Well, now, my friend had this exact walk down and would walk the hallways of our high school.  Look, they're all just walking silly.  Well, it's the Ministry of Silly Walks.  Right.  So silly.  I just wondered why they went from film to video. 
[02:10:00]  Outside was film, inside was video, and it's old English things.  But the thing is, you liked girls.  That's why you liked Benny Hill.  You would see, like, some naked boobs.  But I also found the humor of it.  It was hilarious.  Yeah.  Just slapstick shit.  The only women in this were these guys dressed in dresses.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, don't you think that might have been a problem?  That was like watching porn, though, for me. 
[02:10:30]  But it was on, like, your parents could be around, and you, like, everyone was, you know,  it's just silly.  They were looking at it as, it was silly.  And I'm looking at it like, holy shit, look at those big tits.  Who's the genius that wrote this song?  This is brilliant.  Right.  I remember the bald guys.  It was always great.  Oh, he's not really painting a fence.  He's painting someone's ass.  Yes.  And they put cherries down, too, for nipples?  Yeah, they put cherries down on the bar.  It looks like this girl's completely naked with big boobs, and the two bald guys come  up because they were getting drinks. 
[02:11:00]  And it was their heads, not the tits.  Yeah.  Austin Powers misdirect.  That's all I needed.  That's all I needed.  Austin Powers misdirect.  That's all I needed.  Not the Ministry of Silly Walks.  No.  Just show me something that looks like boobs, but it's really a guy's head.  Oh.  Yeah, little girls in skirts.  And this fat old man running around.  Benny Hill's going to be a classic.  Benny Hill is classic.  He was a pervert.  What happened to him?  He died.  He's dead.  Oh, really?  Poor Benny Hill.  He died sad.  He did?  Everyone dies sad. 
[02:11:30]  Everyone dies sad.  Who are you kidding?  That would be great with the pallbearers in fast motion, like, running around with a  coffin.  Yeah.  I loved the fast motion thing.  Right.  I love the news when they talk about, like, celebrities dying.  It's like, oh, it's just so tragic and sad.  That's how we all go out.  No one goes out.  There's no happy ending.  In a good way.  There's no happy ending.  Right.  Most of us will be destitute or whatever we're known for.  That's gone for years.  You're definitely going to feel like shit. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  At the very least.  Oh, Benny Hill.  He was the best.  Oh, God.  This is so just...  Look, just a girl on an exercise bike.  In little girl school outfits.  Catholic schoolgirl uniforms.  He gets on a bike.  He falls down.  He runs into some tits.  Yeah, he falls.  A lot of falling down.  A lot of falling down.  A girl's bending over to pick him up with lots of cleavage.  Yeah, the writing room. 
[02:12:30]  It must have been fun.  Yeah.  So then what do we do?  Okay, guys.  What ideas have we got?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we were trying to think, what looks like tits?  And we thought, basketballs.  So if we take two basketballs, put Carol behind them, it'll look like her breasts.  Then she moves away, and everyone realizes it was just basketballs.  Brilliant, brilliant.  Let's go with that.  Let's go with that.  That's wonderful.  Should we put the music in?  Yes, and can we film it all in fast motion?  I'd like it in fast motion. 
[02:13:00]  Something completely different than what we've done.  Remember, fellas, faster's funnier.  What do you know what that's about?  It completely sucked.  I'm like, how the fuck do we save this?  Yeah, fast motion with the music.  Fast motion.  Man.  Here's another idea.  Tires look like boobs.  Everybody started with anything.  Something looked like boobs.  Two toasters on the shelf.  We get Carol behind them.  Looks like her ass. 
[02:13:30]  He puts a piece of toast in her ass.  She walks away.  No, it's a toaster.  Toaster.  I like it.  Should we make it fast?  Yes, put the music to it.  Right.  Make it faster.  I'm not.  It could be funny.  Do you think Benny got a lot of pussy?  You think he was like a playboy in England?  Oh, yeah.  He could give you a job.  Yeah, that's true.  Anyone that can give you a job.  Oh, man.  You're right.  Anyone that can give you a job. 
[02:14:00]  Can I redeem myself?  One last shot at this.  Oh, what?  That kitten run.  You're not going back to her.  You're going to save it.  People are going, look, Sam's finding when she was actually doing what's referred to as  granny porn.  All right.  And people are saying you've got to put Kitten and Russ Myers in the search.  I would like to see it because.  She was in the Russ Myers films.  My view of you is really skewed right now.  It's not good.  Oh, man.  Because a lot of people are saying I like trucker ass now.  I don't want them leaving the program today thinking that. 
[02:14:30]  Please.  Wow, they will.  This is really different than what we thought.  I want one more shot at this.  He's a weirdo.  Wow.  I want one more shot at this.  Russ Myers, that kitten brud.  So he's basically turned on by anything.  Benny Hill's been dead 20 years?  No.  Wow.  Somebody just said 20 years.  That would be 92.  Holy shit.  It could be.  It could be.  Psycho.  The Cramps. 
[02:15:00]  What the fuck is this?  What are you doing?  What the hell is going on?  That's a cool song for the people out there.  We get to watch some shit.  Russ Myers, fucking super vixen.  Damn.  He knew how to fucking film shit.  I remember this.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Is that her?  Buxodix.  He's laying in a coffin with a sheet over him, and it's got a boner.  Where is she?  I'm not sure if that's her, but look at those.  That coffin shot looked like Benny Hill.  Look up the cramps.  The way I walk.  The vixens of Russ Meyer.  Is that her?  Oh, man.  That's fucking...  What's his name?  So relaxing.  Wait.  He was in the Blues Brothers. 
[02:16:00]  Here's that guy.  Gonna look funny eating cone on the cob with no fucking teeth.  He played the sheriff.  Yeah.  Why is this a lot on YouTube?  Bo Svensson, I think his name was.  He was good.  Yeah.  There shouldn't be a lot on YouTube.  Bo Svensson.  I've had a couple of my videos yanked.  Oh, they're far less.  Whoa.  Whoa.  That's 70s porno mustache. 
[02:16:30]  Now, what are they doing?  I kind of like this song, too.  It's wild.  It's a good song.  I haven't seen her yet, I don't think.  I haven't either, but who cares?  These actors are kind of...  They look familiar.  It's a lot of 70s actors.  Yeah.  Character actors.  What a cool sound.  Yeah.  Great song.  The cramps.  Is this her? 
[02:17:00]  Russ Myers made some great fucking movies.  Ew.  Younger.  She's penis.  That's her younger.  Wow.  If you put the Benny Hill music to this, it would totally work.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's, um...  She's not a real looker there, Opie.  I gotta tell you.  Yeah.  I can't tell you who's younger here.  She's got a Farrah Fawcett hair.  They're fucking in a coffin. 
[02:17:30]  You know what's so funny?  I just found a new song, man.  They're having sex in a coffin and it's still not as dark as any porn today.  Today, right, right.  I didn't see one person getting a left hook while cum was coming out her nose.  They're in a coffin, but happy about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone was still happy.  I never paid attention to the cramps before.  No, man.  Now you gotta look up some of their shit.  Absolutely.  That was pretty goddamn good.  How old is that song?  I don't even know.  The cramps. 
[02:18:00]  Figure out the cramps.  I have no idea.  They showed her in there, kinda.  Yeah.  Enough to see that even when she was young, she looked like shit.  I really wasn't feeling it.  I think she had like a good week.  Those were desperate times, though, Ant.  You had to take it when you got it.  Oh, it's Charles Napier.  He was in Silence of the Lambs, too.  Is that what his name was?  Who was Bo Svensson?  Oh, Bo Svensson's the other guy.  Now I'm picturing his face, too.  Yeah, they kinda looked similar.  They were similar characters.  That was Charles Napier. 
[02:18:30]  He was in Silence of the Lambs, the guy that got splayed open, the sheriff guy.  Oh, fuck yeah.  He always plays like a cop of some sort.  Very good.  Thank you for the correction.  Soby, did you always like big, sloppy girls?  Yeah.  Yeah, even when Jed used to be...  Big and sloppy.  That's how I like them.  Giant, goofy tits.  I started my life being a giant tit man.  Yeah.  I see that.  I know I did.  And then something happened.  Like, really?  You don't need them fucking giant? 
[02:19:00]  They were giant.  Big and sloppy.  Yeah.  Nice and nasty titties.  Who wants to bring a...  Who wants to bring a tit monster to your family's barbecue?  I always laugh at those guys.  Because the first thought is, holy shit, you love big tits.  Yeah, everyone is just saying that.  That's all you're thinking.  Everyone that you introduced that girl to has gone, oh, so Opie loves the big tits.  No, if you went to the party.  At the barbecue.  Yeah, yeah.  Fair enough.  That would be... 
[02:19:30]  Wow, Opie really likes it.  Something happens where you mature and go, really?  There's more to a woman than if she has giant, huge tits.  Maybe she's really cool but has giant tits.  But everyone's still just going to think you love giant tits.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what happens.  Well, Mongo the Tracker's been waiting for this day for a long time.  Mongo.  Hey, I'll be huge cramps, man.  Check out, like, Goo Goo Mug and another song.  I can't remember that.  It was, I want to see you on my TV.  The guy's lyrics are like, I want your head in my frigid air. 
[02:20:00]  Fucking...  I just like the sound, man.  Yeah.  How long ago were the cramps?  76...  Oh, they were late 60s or 70s.  76 to 2009.  Is there, like, a greatest hits album?  Because I'm completely turned on by the cramps.  I've been high on the cramps for years.  The lead singer just died, like, a year or two ago.  Oh, no way.  What was the biggest hit by those guys?  You know, they weren't...  As far as the biggest hit, you can't say because they weren't a real... 
[02:20:30]  No, I understand that.  I played music on the radio for a long time, and I never, ever played a cramp song.  So I get that part of it.  Wow.  Let's see.  Teenage girls with...  What the hell was it?  I haven't had my coffee yet.  I know.  You stink.  Teenage girls with machine guns on.  I know I do.  All right.  I'll figure it out.  Teenage girls with machine guns on.  Okay.  That's cool.  Thank you, Mongo.  Your phone's a little crappy. 
[02:21:00]  That's why we're kind of whatever.  You know, you used to have to go to the fucking movies to go see those Russ Myers films and  everything.  Yeah.  They were like in the movie, and you went to the movie theater to watch these big...  It wasn't even like the porn theater where you would go, you know, and jack off.  It was a movie, but it was porn, and people went to this.  It was the start of porn.  I think it was like...  It was the start of mainstream porn, not that 8mm, we're having a bachelor party.  No, I'm thinking like...  Stag films.  Stag films. 
[02:21:30]  I'm thinking it's like the fucking Burt Reynolds character in Boogie Nights movies.  Yeah.  Where he would like, we're making a movie here.  You know, it's on film.  It's a real movie.  A real film.  This is a real film, Jack.  It's a real film.  I love that.  The Russ Myers stuff was the first films to be on, you know, TV, though.  Oh, right.  With cable.  They used to put those on cable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, like, it was pretty odd to...  Must have been.  Now, I didn't go.  I was still, amazingly enough, too young. 
[02:22:00]  To go to the movies, sit and watch erotica with a theater full of people.  It's pretty wild.  I kind of hung around nerds when I was growing up.  Yeah.  But I wasn't nerd culture.  That was weird.  Because I came from a very strict upbringing, and we would go to the Bayshore X-Rated Movie  Theater.  I remember going there.  Really?  We'd get, I don't know, a bunch of guys in a car would drink beers, and then we'd get  in with fake IDs, whatever the fuck I'm trying to remember. 
[02:22:30]  I'd go to that one when I was older.  But now you go to an X-Rated Movie Theater, you're looked at as, like, a complete creep,  but there was no other way to see this shit, so you really would go with your pals.  And it was accepted.  Everybody was cool with it.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone from work would go.  It's like, hey, what are you doing tonight?  Hey, let's go to the fucking porno theater.  All right.  But I think you felt like a creep if you went by yourself.  Oh, man.  Which is strange, because it was cooler to go with your, you know, your guy friends.  Because you were joking around.  It is a little weird.  Pussy.  I never got to, like, sharing with your friend. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Very odd.  I mean, you forget all this stuff, man.  You're sitting there, because you didn't, you just didn't get to see this shit.  No.  And you felt like you were doing something really fucking dirty, and then all of a sudden  this fucking giant naked woman is on the screen where you're normally used to seeing  Jaws or something.  Yeah.  You couldn't wrap your head around it.  You're like, holy fuck, this is the greatest thing ever.  You know how jaded we are these days?  I could go through so much porno on the computer with nary a twitch going on in my pants.  Right. 
[02:23:30]  Just kind of, you're like, all right, yeah, there's her, there's that.  I remember going to, like, the Bayshore Theater.  You'd sit down, the movie would start, and you'd have to, like, hide your raging heart  on, because your pals are right there next to you.  Instantly, too.  Instant fucking boner.  You're like, holy shit, look at that.  Now it's just bad, it's bad, that sucks, bad, whatever.  When I go down that road, it's like, I like Girls Daily, or I like Sex Daily is one of  her other accounts, or his, I don't even know who fucking runs this fucking sacred Twitter  account.  But I'll go, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. 
[02:24:00]  I'll go through pictures like a hundred a minute.  So cold.  No, no, no, uh-oh, maybe.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Cold, hard souls.  We've just been so jaded by all the great pornography out there.  It's amazing.  I am being reminded that I did not drink beers.  I drank road sodas.  Never.  Road sodas.  Road soda.  We used to figure it cold by calling them road sodas.  Road sodas.  Oh, that's horrible.  Get some road sodas. 
[02:24:30]  Road soda.  Oh, just stick them up your ass.  The tits aren't big enough.  Yeah, he needs a big sloppy tits.  He needs grandma boobs.  The shared experience is very awesome.  We're being told, Surfin' Dead by the Cramps or Bikini Girls with Machine Guns, which Mongo  said as well.  Yeah, let's listen to the...  I would say Bikini Girls with Machine Guns on Twitter.  Yeah, that's the big one.  It definitely has that sound like Tarantino would use it in movies.  Fuck yeah.  Cramps. 
[02:25:00]  Oh my God.  That looks like Ted Danson.  Yeah.  Well, I've been a drag racer on LSD.  Yeah.  Oh.  Bare ass.  Oh.  Top of the swings.  I even had a gorilla on the slopes.  A kismet.  And man, man, I was born.  That has like a Johnny Cash rhythm to it.  Yeah.  Doesn't sound like Johnny Cash, but you know what I mean?  That...  The delivery? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  A little straight catch thrown in.  Why did I not know about the cramps?  Quentin Tarantino brought all this front and center, like you were saying.  Yeah, that's the kind of...  All the surfer music and stuff.  Surfer.  Yeah.  Guitar.  It was very niche and not many people were checking it out outside, I guess, California  or whatever.  And now it's like, fuck, that sound is cool.  Yeah, that's pretty good stuff.  I like the first song better.  That is pretty good. 
[02:26:00]  You need to like roll up some cigarettes in your sleeve.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Not bad.  All right.  We can move on.  You can watch some big, big boob porn of that.  Yeah.  Some giant, sloppy, fucking droopy...  You know.  No offense. 
[02:26:30]  No offense.  Speaking of porn, Al-Qaeda attack plans found hidden in a porn movie.  I did not know this.  Wow.  Wow.  Hundreds of internal Al-Qaeda documents embedded inside a pornographic movie on a memory disk  have a review of cost to carry out attacks in Europe, similar to the November 2008 Mumbai  attacks.  Whoa.  Really?  On porn.  Where?  Who found that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who found that?  Who's the guy that's going to fess up to that? 
[02:27:00]  13-year-old Bobby Johnson.  I found it.  Some guy in trouble for watching porn.  It went, no, no, no, no.  This is going to sound weird.  There's secret messages in here.  I'm watching this for my job.  Honey, don't get mad, but I've got to tell you something.  Yeah.  I was watching this porn.  Oh, God.  I think they're going to attack Europe.  But I saved a lot of people.  You know what?  You can look at it one way, but I saved people.  I knew you were going to take it that way.  Yeah, yeah.  I knew you were going to take it that way. 
[02:27:30]  You're such a glass-half-full person.  Or empty.  I don't know.  So, interrogators questioning a 22-year-old Austrian.  This guy recently returned from Pakistan.  Uh, via Budapest, Hungary.  Then went on to Germany.  They were surprised to find a digital storage device and memory cards hidden in his underpants.  Germany.  You can only imagine what type of porno was on there, huh?  A little shit video going on there, huh?  Leather shit videos.  Leather shit videos. 
[02:28:00]  Maybe a guy fucking a chicken, perhaps.  To tech Germans.  Uh, buried inside them was a pornographic video called Kick-Ass, and a file marked Sexy Tanja.  Tanja.  T-A-N-J-A.  Tanja.  Tanja.  Uh, then, uh, a few weeks later, German investigators discovered a treasure trove of intelligence encoded  inside the actual video.  Oh, fuck.  Wow.  Ah.  Wow.  How do you fucking figure that out?  How do you even figure that out?  I didn't even figure that out.  I didn't even figure that out.  I didn't even figure that out there.  Yeah.  Where's it going to look? 
[02:28:30]  Oh, it's just the porn.  Oh, dude, I'm totally keeping this porn.  Yeah.  And then he's at home that night.  I would be going through it and be like, oh, yeah, she's good.  Yeah, that one's...  I have, uh, Al-Qaeda plans.  Fuck that.  Ah, here it is.  That chick's hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, I got to take care of business first.  Al-Qaeda.  Well, maybe that'll turn me on.  Yeah.  What's this one?  Finally, something that I haven't seen before.  They're saying the word is rockabilly, the cramps. 
[02:29:00]  Rockabilly.  Rockabilly.  Oh, that kind of...  Yeah.  I hear a little more than rockabilly in there, though.  No?  Yeah, a little rockabilly.  Yeah, it's like surfer music.  I hear the surfer shit, too.  Bikini girls with machine guns.  It's funny you just did that, because Chris, comic book guy, he goes, you guys suck.  Now I got Rocky Horror stuck screaming in my head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Overrated shit.  No, you go at midnight.  It's the best.  Yeah, yeah.  You go at midnight.  As long as you go to a midnight show, you can enjoy yourself.  Believe me.  No, you're going to love it.  Come on, just come.  No, I thought the same thing, but then once I went the first time, I was hooked.  You're going to do the same thing.  I know it feels weird dressing up, but when you get there, everybody else's, you'll feel  good.  Yeah, yeah, you'll feel very comfortable and fine.  And then after it's over, it's like, so, right?  I was right, right?  So, right.  Next week?  You know what? 
[02:30:00]  No.  No.  You weren't right.  I knew it.  It was just like when someone took me to a dead show.  You got to go once you see Jerry and them.  They're up there.  Oh, yeah, really?  No.  Here's another filthy girl with hairy legs and armpits dancing with a tie-dyed skirt with  her hands in the air.  No.  I'm out.  We, believe it or not, have to take another break.  Why?  That means we're having a good show.  We're way behind on breaks, Sam.  Yeah.  You only did two.  Shit.  Two?  Yeah, you're supposed to take your third one.  Good. 
[02:30:30]  I can kick back in my chair.  Well, we're supposed to take eight breaks every morning.  Theoretically.  We barely take five.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Four to five a day.  Why are we break?  I won't be returning next weekend.  Thank you.  No, that was it.  One and done for you?  One and so fucking done.  I truly believe I never went.  I'm not positive.  I never went.  Because I think they play in that North Fork Theater. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, they did.  Yeah, yeah.  And I feel like I never went, but someone might be able to call me out on that.  Yeah.  As bad as I wanted to be out at midnight anywhere in high school, I was like, that sounds lame.  I knew when I went, it was, you know, I was still trying to get laid and stuff.  Yeah.  And we didn't have a lot of choices, let's be honest with each other.  Now these kids, they got choices every Friday and Saturday.  Exactly.  We fucking just wandered around looking for something.  Looking for something.  Into the woods. 
[02:31:30]  It always ended in the woods, right?  I was the one.  You could meet up with people because you didn't know, you could even meet up with people  because you didn't even know where they were.  We didn't have phones.  No phones.  I used to drive around looking for my friends.  Yeah, you would hope you would bump into them and they maybe had a good idea.  Remember?  It's like I had a warrant for them.  I'm just fucking driving around.  Where is he?  Is that him?  I think that's him.  Fucking looking around.  Just a bunch of horny teenagers in cars going the streets.  I'd see fucking friends, you know, I'd see another friend, you'd be like, hey, come  here.  You see Joe Curry tonight? 
[02:32:00]  I think he's down by the Dairy Queen.  Down by the Dairy Queen.  You sure?  What was he wearing?  Like you had to fucking act like a cop.  Exactly.  The whole time you went to go for trying to find your fucking friends.  A stakeout to try to find your friends.  No cell phone, no nothing.  If you missed him at five in the afternoon before he went out, that's it.  It was always like, all right, let's try the bowling alley.  Yeah.  All right, we'll go to the bowling alley.  Nah, fuck.  Roger that.  We're going to hit the bowling alley and see if we can't find the perp.  Where's Kelly?  Let's go to the woods.  Yeah, and then just regroup at the woods. 
[02:32:30]  Let's go to the woods.  Yeah, all right.  Must be in the woods.  Everyone, pull back to the Alamo.  Pull back to the Alamo.  You pick up one of your friends in the woods.  Okay, good.  Anyone hanging in the woods?  Who's hanging in the woods?  Did you get the bottle of Jack?  Where is everybody?  I thought we were going to the woods.  Going to the fucking woods.  Where are we?  Ah, fucking, ah, Frank wheeled out with a chick.  Fucking guy, man.  Man.  We had the best hideout.  It was off 25A.  It was a road that no one knew about except for the people that lived there, if that makes  sense.  It was like five or six houses. 
[02:33:00]  And it was like, I swear they didn't even cut the bushes where the road started on 25A.  Because I guess they didn't want anyone to, they wanted their privacy.  So easy.  When we discovered that, it wasn't like, it was still a dirt road from back in the day.  And you pull right in there and fuck, no one would bother us.  It was an amazing spot.  Awesome.  Because other spots, other people knew about.  It's like you were running moonshine.  Did you go to Northport Cemetery at all, ever?  No.  Because you knew some early goth girls back in the day. 
[02:33:30]  And they, I called them the godmother of goth.  Nice.  Much like Edgar Allan Poe was the godfather of goth, as we were told.  And we used to hang out at the cemetery, but they were like those weird chicks.  That always creeped me out.  They creeped me out too, but I, again, just trying to get laid out.  Baseball fields were always good too.  Baseball fields are good.  Get a little dugout.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Way out in the field.  Jackson Brown playing.  Leahy School. 
[02:34:00]  Thomas Leahy School.  John Mellon Camp.  I used to hang out back there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was a little playground area, and then a huge grass field, and then the woods.  Yeah.  And the church parking lot.  It was like fucking trifecta.  Little ditty.  Oh, yeah, it was, definitely.  For checking time.  It was every fucking Bob Seger song.  God damn.  We got tonight.  Yeah.  Who needs tomorrow?  Oh, my God.  We got tonight, babe.  Why don't you stay?  That was my life, was every fucking Bob Seger song. 
[02:34:30]  Out there in the woods, we got heaven.  Out of the backseat of my...  I used her, she used me, and neither one cared.  Neither one cared.  Yeah, I want to use you.  Yeah, I don't care either.  I don't care if I get used either.  Use me!  Use me!  Make fun all you want, man.  That Bob Seger's all right.  Oh, man.  That guy kicks ass.  Bob Seger.  How do you describe tits?  Points.  Oh, yeah.  The points.  Oh, yeah.  Sitting way up high.  Sitting way up high.  Yeah, yeah.  Sitting way up high.  Working on the night moves.  Working on the night moves.  Those were some perky nips.  No, the night moves. 
[02:35:00]  He was singing about perky nips, and I knew that as a kid.  Yeah, I was just old enough.  Trying to make it out.  Yeah, working on the night moves.  Points sitting up high.  Yeah.  Combing your hair, getting ready to go out.  Night moves.  Like a rock.  We should just place it a break.  Fuck it.  For the old guys out there.  We'll be back.  I was a little too tall.  Could have used a few pounds.  Tight pants, points, hauling her now. 
[02:35:30]  She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes.  And points all her own.  Sitting way up high.  Out past the cornfields when the woods got heavy.  Out in the backseat of my 60s Chevy.  Working on mysteries without any clues. 
[02:36:00]  Working on our night moves.  Working on our night moves.  Trying to make some front-page driving news.  Working on our night moves.  In the summer time.  In the sweet summertime.  We weren't in love 
[02:36:30]  Hold no far from  We weren't searching  For some high  Inside some  We were just young  And restless  And bored  Living by the sword  And we'd steal away  Every chance we could  To the Mac room  To the alley  Or the trusty woods  I used to have  She used me  But neither one cared 
[02:37:00]  We were getting our share  Working on our nightmares  Trying to lose  The awkward teenage blues  Working on our nightmares  And we're summertime  Sweet  Summer time  Summer time 
[02:37:30]  Oh  Wonder  I felt the lightning  I waited on the thunder  I waited on the thunder 
[02:38:00]  I woke last night to the sound of thunder  How far off I sat and wondered  Started humming a song from 1962  In a funny how the night moves  When you just don't seem to have as much to lose 
[02:38:30]  Strange how the night moves  With all them closing in  Night moves 
[02:39:00]  Night moves  Night moves  Night moves  Night moves  Night move  Night move  Night move  I sure remember the night moves  Night moves  In a funny how I remember  Night move  I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember 
[02:39:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh  Oh, waking, waking and practicing  Oh, waking and practicing  Oh, oh, the night moon, night moon  Oh, I remember  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember 
[02:40:00]  Ooh, I remember  Lord, I remember  Lord, I remember  Ooh, ooh  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Uh-huh, uh-huh  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:40:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That's liking the show today.  Tom Papa helping us out.  It's funny because you talk about this shit.  You don't even know if it's going to stick or not. 
[02:41:00]  People are sending me now their first Playmate crush.  Adorable.  Nice.  And Chip Spicer.  What's that?  Chip Spicer.  What's that?  E.R.  My first Playmate crush from October 1987.  Brandi Brandt.  Brandi Brandt.  Brandi Brandt.  I know the name.  Look at Brandi Brandt.  I know the name.  Brandi Brandt.  Wow.  She wore the pussy hair pretty good.  That pussy hair is sticking out.  It's a profile shot of her.  But she's wearing it pretty well.  A whole side body.  And it's sticking out like a front bumper. 
[02:41:30]  You got to know how to wear that pussy hair.  You do.  She's wearing it well.  Her boobs are definitely not in Opie's category.  All right.  Well, they could be bigger and sloppier.  Sloppy.  Jumbo sloppy.  I said I got past that.  Jumbo sloppy.  I got past that stage.  Yeah.  Fuck.  She's a good one.  Sure.  Yeah.  But everyone remembers their first Playmate crush.  Yeah.  They were nice.  Oh, yes.  The good old days.  Most people were weaned on Playboy.  Yeah.  Maybe Penthouse was pretty hardcore.  But once you got into swank and we and high society, then you were really getting some 
[02:42:00]  good shit.  You knew.  And the wheels came off.  That's a young Donald Trump.  Jeez.  His hair was fucked up back then.  What year is this?  It really was.  God.  80.  80 something.  90?  90.  90.  90.  That's 20.  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't know.  22 years ago.  It was a simple time before all the technology came in.  Wow.  He always had fucked up hair, huh?  But technology is what really started to change it all.  Changed everything. 
[02:42:30]  I mean, even like getting into, like we were talking about like rolling around looking  for your friends and stuff.  Yeah.  It's like you had no devices on you.  I said.  To contact your friends.  No way to get them unless it was the phone in their house before they went out for the  night.  Right.  But I said you had to be a little detective and you would pick up clues along the way.  And by the end of the night, if you were lucky, you were all together.  You were all together.  But then it was too late.  Your fucking curfew hit.  You rarely got everyone together unless it was a planned thing beforehand.  But but you would figure out like like you'd ask other people questions like you were 
[02:43:00]  saying and they'd go, oh, yeah, you was over like Sue's house or he was with someone  that was like, all right, let's go to Sue's house.  We're going there.  Turn on the lights inside.  Oh, shit.  We don't have.  But anyway, we'll go there and make sure.  Yeah.  And you have to fucking kind of follow these leads.  Yeah.  And in between the whole, you know, what would what would take precedent over any friend  finding mission?  Road sodas.  No, chicks.  Chicks.  Because you're always looking for chicks as you're driving around.  Where are they?  Where are the girls?  Where are the chicks tonight? 
[02:43:30]  Where are the girls?  Where are they hanging tonight?  They're at Allison's house.  Let's try.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to find five girls.  Hey, what you guys doing?  They were always in a pack.  They were always in a pack.  You can separate them.  And then you were in a pack.  So, you know, you found the girls like, OK, group of us, group of you.  I was good in a party atmosphere, like especially home field advantage party in my own house.  It was great.  Like my mom would go to work on the weekends.  She would work a disco.  Nice. 
[02:44:00]  Five in the morning, six in the morning, she'd come home.  So I was good.  But if there was a party at other people's houses, I could work a party pretty well with  girls.  Yeah.  If I was out, though, like trying to pick up a girl or something, it wasn't going to  happen.  I needed something where I went to school with them.  Right.  We're at the same party.  Some of the same people.  Nothing new.  A cold call.  No way.  No way.  I'm failing miserably.  It's got to change now, like when you can just sit there with your smartphone and  just text any girl, just kind of throw it out there. 
[02:44:30]  There's no fucking fear of rejection when it's just text.  You could throw so much out there and you could have a pretty sexually graphic relationship  on the text and Twitter before.  Always dancing around the edges of it.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  You know, like if you were to like reject it, you'd be like, no, it's not totally mean  that.  You know, we're just fucking around here.  We're just DMing you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just DMing.  You ever do that though? 
[02:45:00]  You're fucking, you're on Twitter and you have a DM and you're like fucking, do you type  it all out and you're ready?  You're like, should I, should I, I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I shouldn't.  I did.  I did.  Fuck.  I'm an asshole.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  Did.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  Yes.  Did.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  How do I get it back?  Yeah.  Well, there's no taking it back.  There's no taking it back.  No taking it back.  It's out there forever.  Once you're out there, it's out there.  If you end up looking like a shithead, dickbag, fuck ass for doing it, then so be it. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  Forever.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Did.  Did.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes.  Can, can, can, can, can, can, can.  And you always think, well, no one will know.  Everyone will know.  Everyone will know.  Everyone.  What else is going on out there?  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  We're also talking about how like at, at parties and, and whatever you're at, it used 
[02:46:00]  to be a lot of talking and I know a lot of people talking about it these days, but it  really, you got to take a look and wonder where this is going in the future.  It's scary.  I've been to parties, just hangouts, whatever, where it has been dead silent for quite a length  of time with everyone just staring at their phones and tapping away at their screens.  And it's not even an insult.  Like, I used to get bitched at for answering my phone at a dinner or something.  Like, really? 
[02:46:30]  Do you need to?  No, not long ago.  Yeah.  And now it's totally acceptable to be like, yeah, all right, I'll have the shrimp cocktail  appetizer and bring me a Bud Light.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's the last thing that's said.  Or for the waiters, like you're on the phone.  People are on the phone talking and talking to the Starbucks person or the waiter and they're  totally accepted now.  Everything is accepted like that.  I don't use my phone to talk at all.  No, I don't either.  No.  No.  Really?  Maybe once a week at this point.  Maybe.  Really?  And that's because maybe my mom or some old school person calls. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  I hate it.  No, I don't use my phone to talk ever.  Ever.  Wow.  Just about ever.  Just about ever.  I hate talking on the phone.  No, man.  Wow.  It's, you know, usually something bad.  So I just don't want to talk on the phone.  It's true.  It's always, conversations are like now heavy.  It's like, you're talking to family.  We also talk for a living.  So, you know, after this is over, the last thing I want to do is talk anytime soon.  So I go through most of the, the rest of my day will be spent not talking.  Wow.  Mute.  For real.  You know, I was saying before, my friend is a bartender and she loves it and just love 
[02:47:30]  the atmosphere and everybody meeting people.  Socializing.  It sucks now because everyone down the bar is just looking at the phone.  Fuck.  Even in bars.  No one's talking to each other.  It's amazing.  And I was in a bar the other day and I was just like, I, from that story, I was like,  no, I'm just going to keep it in my pocket because I want to do it too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all slaves to it.  I started talking to this dude next to me.  He was in from Denver.  It was his first time in New York.  And we're just like, had some common friends to get people.  We kind of, and it was like, oh my, I just met a real person. 
[02:48:00]  It's a real conversation.  Hey, I just had a real conversation.  I felt like telling everybody.  I was like, I met someone today.  We spoke.  I interacted with somebody.  People are interesting.  People are interesting.  You guys bring up the cell phone thing.  I was at the playground with my son yesterday and I wanted to knock, I literally wanted to  knock out a father yesterday.  Right.  Because my.  You're going to get in a situation one day.  I know.  By the way.  I really want to.  I could tell.  But I'm very aware that I'm going to be. 
[02:48:30]  So I think I'm good for now, but I'll tell you what happened.  So I, we just got to the playground and I was checking my phone and he started on his  way, but he wasn't in any situation yet.  Yeah.  Where I have to pay attention.  And I hear this father go, get off your phone.  And I went, is he talking to me?  Because if he is, I will knock him out.  And I looked up and there were so many parents on their phones.  I didn't know if he was talking to me. 
[02:49:00]  Didn't matter.  So I was like, and then the rest of the time I'm trying to figure out if he indeed was  talking to me because I still want to knock him out.  Really?  But I had no proof because so many parents were on their cell phones at that moment.  It's bad.  There's going to be a big cultural reaction to all this.  Yeah.  I'm not sure what it is.  What's the future?  But we're like right at the beginning of it, but there's going to be some big, we don't  communicate like we used to.  We communicate a lot more with a lot more people than we ever did. 
[02:49:30]  But it's not an intimate communication.  It's not real human interaction.  Just real experience.  Like the time you use your phone more than anything is when you're in any kind of boring,  mundane situation like sitting online, sitting in a cab, waiting for the subway.  Oh, yeah.  Or the playground.  Yeah.  Comes right out.  And literally, I've been consciously keeping it in my pocket in those situations.  Oh, give in.  But no, but you realize, just to see like what you would do.  It shows you more of like what's happened to you.  Yes, yes. 
[02:50:00]  Like, so I'm now cutting those experiences just out of my life.  Like, just waiting is now no longer a part of being a human being.  You need to have something going on.  I actually look forward to waiting now.  Really?  Because you can get on your phone and get on your phone.  Yeah, you can check my Twitter.  Maybe I had something I wanted to tweet.  I don't know.  Check my Instagram.  I get it.  Maybe to, yeah, something.  I did a playground mishap on the phone.  We were here in New York and my daughter was going on the pole going down. 
[02:50:30]  Uh-oh.  I was, and she just went too fast and like landed on the, uh, and, uh, it, I mean, if I wasn't on my phone, I wouldn't still be standing under her.  But just that I was glancing down while that happened.  Oh, man.  It just makes you think, uh.  Yeah.  Maybe I should just pay complete and total attention.  Yeah.  Maybe I don't need to check the score of the Yankee game right now.  There's, there's a, I was, I was saying before, you communicate with a lot more people. 
[02:51:00]  You, you, you give information back and forth.  But there's no risk anymore in rejection.  There's no risk in like, um, bombing, looking bad.  And there just isn't, because, because you're anonymous for the most part.  Yeah.  You're, you're reacting and talking to so many people.  Yeah.  Thousands upon thousands.  And you can push it.  You can push everything a little further.  There takes no more bravery.  It used to be, the guy that would just walk up to a few girls at a bar or a fucking wherever. 
[02:51:30]  And just be like, hi, how you doing?  Yeah, I'm hanging out with her.  It was like, holy shit, this guy's the most amazing person ever.  He's like a magician.  He's brave.  He's fucking a knight.  He's amazing.  Now it's just, hey, fucking, what are you doing?  You're hot.  Right.  Fucking sexy.  God, yeah.  Yeah.  Now you check your Twitter and you get people going, I'm watching you.  Yeah, what, what, what, what?  And then, it's happened at like, my brother's, you know, restaurant, FHR, a few other places.  Then I'm looking around like, who's the serial killer in the room? 
[02:52:00]  I know.  Exactly.  But it will have some type of reaction.  It is strange.  I don't know what it is.  It's really strange.  I don't know what it is.  They were saying that kids.  You think we'll get bored of it?  No.  No.  I don't think it's going back.  I don't think it's going back.  This is no hula hoop, my friend.  Because it's having real.  So you think our tongues go away?  It's having real.  They stop talking?  Yeah.  We'll get that one tooth.  There's just the one tooth.  No, but there's that real thing.  Like, kids now aren't buying cars.  Because cars don't mean anything.  Like, when we needed a car to go find your friends and do all that stuff.  Right, right. 
[02:52:30]  They don't need it.  They don't need it for experience.  They don't need it to meet people.  They don't need it to feel cool.  That was the single most important thing growing up was, when am I going to be able to get a car?  It was second to none.  That was it.  It was a portal, a literal portal to freedom.  To freedom, to your future, to sex, to fucking drinking, to everything.  Everything.  Now it's a smartphone.  Now it's like, hey, I got my iPhone.  Let me tap away.  And look, there's a girl right there.  There she is.  I didn't even have to drive. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, it's brutal.  Senior's not going to be singing about smartphones.  Betty White's on TV right now.  Again?  When an old lady wears lipstick, does that mean she's still down to fuck?  Wow.  Yeah.  Why do old people wear lipstick?  Because they have no lips left.  Yeah, that is true.  They usually make them way bigger than the real lip is, and it falls into those little creases.  It's to hide the pumpkin collapsing in on itself.  Pumpkin collapsing mouth. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, yes.  Caving in.  You're jack-o'-lantern after two weeks.  The November 15th pumpkin.  Put some lipstick around.  No one will know.  Your head's caving in.  But the point of lipstick is to, you know, kind of go, hey, man, this is what my pussy  looks like.  Is that what lipstick is?  I don't know.  Someone help me out.  It is.  That's exactly what it is.  You're highlighting your lips.  Yeah.  For sexual purposes.  So when an old lady does that. 
[02:54:00]  Really?  Yes.  Is she still down to do some fucking?  No.  So why do they do it?  She's doing it because she's on TV.  I think it is to just cover up the fact that your lips are gone.  Yeah.  I have no lips.  I like when it wicks up to their nostrils through those little cracks, those age lines.  So it just wicks up.  It's like a little river.  It's an old pumpkin.  An old fucking pumpkin mouth.  And if you pick it up, it has a soggy bottom.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Women turn into pumpkins.  It's terrible.  It's a rotting pumpkin. 
[02:54:30]  It's so sad.  Life stinks.  Life is awful.  There's no good happy ending.  There's just no happy ending at all.  Don't tell me with your dumb commercials for fucking Depends and other shit.  It's like, these are the best years of my life.  Oh, my God.  Really?  It wasn't when you were in your 20s.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck those 20s when you could run.  When you went off to college.  Okay.  Yeah.  That period sucked, right?  Oh, Jamie Lee Curtis now.  And all these people that used to be hot are now like,  She's fucking gave up. 
[02:55:00]  Are your bones disintegrating?  Yeah.  Yeah, Sally Field for Boniva.  I like calling people out on this.  You really thought Jamie Lee Curtis was hot?  I mean, she was young and stuff.  I did.  She had a nice set on her.  Her body was amazing.  I thought she was sexy.  I thought she was sexy.  I thought she had a really nice body, but I thought her face was light.  Trading places, she looked great.  She was, yeah, there's something sexy about her.  She had confidence.  You think?  Yeah.  Definitely.  You're looking with hindsight, I think.  It's very hard to look at a hot girl.  No, she had an amazing body.  Absolutely.  Yeah, look at that.  Her body was fucking great. 
[02:55:30]  She was great.  I always saw a little man in her face.  Well, that was the big rumor, right?  A little bit.  A little bit.  A hermaphrodite.  A little bit of a man.  She looked pretty good.  I've always liked her.  Made up for anything.  I like the short hair.  Yeah.  Now she just decided she wasn't going to dye her hair anymore, so it's gray.  She's selling that take-a-shit yogurt now.  Yeah, she looks like Dick Clark now.  Oh, it's so upsetting when they keep, just go away and let us remember the good parts.  Don't tell me about how you're taking. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, look at that.  Look at that body.  It's amazing.  That's pretty great.  That's from Trading Places.  That's great.  She's got that high leg-line fucking thong thing she's wearing, and her tits are hanging  out right before she was going to get into bed.  Do you want to be more regular?  Do you want to be more regular?  Take Activia.  Yeah, eat Activia yogurt, and you'll shit regular.  Remember when I was all sexy and topless in Trading Places?  Well, fuck that shit.  Now I'm talking about taking regular dumps with my short, dykey gray hair. 
[02:56:30]  So sad.  Oh, man.  Dumps shooting through the gray ass hairs.  Oh, God.  Well, she had to tell everyone, look, this is my normal look.  Fuck that Hollywood makeup.  Five wipes to get all that Activia shit off of her ass.  She's just sitting there talking about Activia and how it pushes the shit out of you.  Why doesn't anyone just go away when it's time?  Why do you have to stick around and talk about your innards?  Clinically proven.  In like two weeks, you'll be shitting like a man. 
[02:57:00]  Right out your pooper.  Yep.  There she is eating it, smiling, going, I can't wait.  Look at shit.  Who's the one?  There's another actress who was hot who's now doing Depends.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you see that?  It's very recent.  Yeah.  They're trying to sell these fucking adult diapers like they're underwear now.  Like they're hip.  It's just about like, yeah, hey, let me tell you.  Well, she was never hot, but Whoopi Goldberg.  Well, she was doing the piss pads, the poised piss pads.  I guess she had to tell the world that she pees herself when she laughs.  To make a few bucks.  To make a few bucks.  There it is. 
[02:57:30]  Lisa Rinna.  Lisa Rinna.  Rinna?  She's wearing Depends.  Yeah, she's talking about Depends.  Look at those stupid tights.  She's like on the red carpet with a tight black dress.  She's like, all right, go back a little bit.  Go back.  I want to hear this.  Oh, this is so sad.  Hey, everyone.  I'm here on the red carpet with Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin.  And guess what?  Lisa has tried on and is currently wearing the new Depends silhouette for women.  Why would she do this?  Oh, my God.  The women's briefs that look, fit, and feel just like underwear.  Lisa, why did you do it?  Well, I did it because I am a champion for positive self-image for women. 
[02:58:00]  And what I love about the silhouette is it makes a woman feel confident.  And it's fashionable.  Harry, thoughts?  I don't know.  She was poured into that dress.  You can't even tell she's wearing them.  Oh, my God.  This is so awesome.  Hold on.  This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Great career.  Oh, my God.  This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.  This is the end of show business for them.  The last stop on the way to...  I'm horrified. 
[02:58:30]  I told you.  I couldn't even talk.  Like, I wanted to say stuff during that exchange.  That's too fascinating.  Holy shit.  Unless you're getting, like, $10 million.  Harry Hamlin is standing there.  This is his wife.  His wife.  She's trying to now.  She's in a dress.  She's doing all these sexy red carpet poses because you can't see her diety.  Her diapers.  And the guy's holding up a box of diapers.  A box.  Like you would for your kids.  Harry, what do you think?  What do you think Harry thinks?  Fuck.  She pisses herself. 
[02:59:00]  What do I think?  What do I think?  Her wife shits herself in public and has to wear diapers.  What do you think I think, fucker?  Holy shit.  I love to see the two of them, like, when they get the call from the agent.  Yeah.  You know, like, when she walks in and is like, honey?  Lisa, Harry?  That was my agent.  Oh, really?  What did you get?  Another big part?  We can keep the beach house?  Yeah.  Well, it's kind of interesting.  It's for Depends.  So what do we do?  Seriously, seriously.  They want to bring our parents into this, and we visit them, and they're wearing Depends? 
[02:59:30]  Well, no.  I mean, they are different now.  They make them, like, they actually don't feel like bulky things.  They want me to wear a dress, and you can be in it, too.  Oh, well, who's wearing the diaper?  And just, like, that sadness, like, and then after the silence.  How much?  Well, it's the beach house, Harry.  We can keep the beach house.  All right, Lisa, put them on.  So we just have to go in public, and you have to tell people that you shit yourself. 
[03:00:00]  Let's see the rest of this.  Put up, also, Lisa Renner and Playboy, so we can get a before really quick.  Oh, no.  Lisa Renner and Playboy.  She was in Playboy?  Well, somebody says it here.  Let's see.  She fucked up her face at least ten years ago at this point, huh?  Oh, it's so sad.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Now you're right.  Now I see Jamie Lee Curtis as a man, because this is a real woman.  Oh, and then she's selling diapers and wearing them.  Oh, this is terrible. 
[03:00:30]  Life is awful.  Oh, we have some more goodness here.  Let's hear that some more.  I want to hear Harry again.  Hold on.  Go back a little.  I got to hear Harry.  When Harry's asked, what do you think, Harry?  Yeah.  Greatest acting job ever.  You should get an Oscar for this.  And there's a Depends mic flag on the microphone.  It's like we're here on the red carpet.  Hey, hey, Tom Cruise, come talk to Depends.  Depends on the mic.  It should just be an arrow that says, shits herself.  Who are the Depends people talking to on the red carpet? 
[03:01:00]  Come here.  Dakota Fanning.  Dakota Fanning.  All right.  Let's hear.  Harry, thoughts?  I know.  She was poured into that dress.  You can't even tell she's wearing them.  I just got to do the touch test, okay?  Wait, because, wait a minute.  I mean, you've got these things on, right?  Yeah, you can't even feel it.  And I cannot even feel it.  He's running his finger down her hip.  It looks fantastic on you.  I am wearing an evening gown, for God's sake.  I cannot tell.  And you can't tell I have it on.  Oh, fuck it.  I fucked it up.  I was going to say, is that guy wearing used Depends on his fucking head? 
[03:01:30]  His head.  It's the worst fucking rug ever.  The worst.  Or it's dyed or something.  Holy shit.  It's three people.  Wow.  What's great about it is because it's three people who are not saying anything honest  about what's going on.  No, no.  Each one of them wants to go, holy shit, what happened to me?  Lisa Radd is wearing diapers.  Harry Hamlin's feeling her diaper to see if it comes to her evening gown.  I'm wearing a fucking wig and holding a giant box of Depends.  We're not really on the red carpet. 
[03:02:00]  You were once a sex symbol.  Yeah.  Harry, Harry, you married a sex symbol who was in Playboy.  Thoughts?  Now she's wearing diapers and on national television.  Thoughts, Harry.  Thoughts?  Do you have a gun?  All right.  Let's hear a little more of this.  Oh, God.  This product shows women you can still look and feel fabulous.  And you're doing it for charity, right?  I am.  I'm doing it for Dress for Success, which is an amazing charity that helps women get  their confidence back so that they can go back out in the workplace and get their lives 
[03:02:30]  back together.  That slim fit looks great on you.  Isn't that cotton-like fabric comfortable?  It feels great.  And you're so soft.  How about giving our viewers a little runway model turn for a great cause?  No.  I'd love to.  Oh, my gosh.  Look at his head.  Get your pre-sample today.  It's got the worst.  Harry's head, right?  Harry's like a matriarchist dummy.  This was an SNL skid, right?  No.  Yeah, what was that on?  You sure?  That was real? 
[03:03:00]  That was real stuff.  That is horrific.  That is the end of a career right there.  The sad ending.  That's it.  The sad, sad ending.  That's it.  You're done.  Mike brings up a very good point.  There's so much ass-fucking today.  Women are just shitting themselves.  They need their pants.  Oh, no.  Is that what it is?  Mike Puppets.  Harry, you caused this.  Harry.  You're coming out there with me.  Harry's tooling her in the ass, and her bowels are a little loose these days. 
[03:03:30]  Harry, you finally broke me down.  Got me to agree to it.  Now you're going to pay.  That is horrible.  Kirstie Owley.  People are bringing up Kirstie Owley.  For what?  Why?  She doesn't do those, does she?  She's all right.  Nah, she does the...  What does she do?  I think she was overrated, too.  She's fat now.  When she was in her prime.  She looked good in Rathacan.  She definitely looked good.  Yeah, Rathacan.  She looked good in Rathacan.  Cheers.  She looked good in Cheers.  What about the one from...  The one that's the most depressing of all is the one from Weird Science. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Look.  See?  Kirstie looks pretty good there.  That's pretty damn good right there.  That's pretty sexy right there.  All right.  I'm going to shut the fuck up.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Wow.  That looks really good.  Who's the one from Weird...  Sally Field?  Weird Science was Kelly LeBrock.  Kelly LeBrock is the biggest disappointment ever.  You see what she looks like today?  She was on Celebrity Fit Club.  She was so desperate for this weight.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Yeah, there she is.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Oh, no. 
[03:04:30]  She looks...  Now she looks like Chet from fucking Weird Science.  Hey, I'm a big pile of shit.  Oh, my God.  She was amazing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  That is...  Yeah.  Oh, she's...  Oh, God.  What shoulders.  She's got really wide shoulders.  She grew some wide shoulders.  Very wide.  Oh, what happened?  She was...  I guess you need the money and you can't do anything else, so you can't just go away.  Yeah, you can't just disappear.  You just got to put on a diaper. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, that picture of her standing in the doorway when she first came out in Weird Science with  the little underwear on.  Oh, good God.  Half shirt.  Holy cow.  The lips.  The lips.  Yeah.  She had zooks.  And now...  And now...  Just a question.  Now...  Oh, God.  And that's her dressed up.  That's her without her diaper.  Yeah.  Someone told me she'd need a much bigger diaper than Lisa Rana.  Now she's Opie size.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  She got down Opie titties with that trucker ass.  Yeah.  You know, it's Sally Field.  She was so cute in Smokey and the Bandit and all those movies.  And now she's doing some kind of bone-lying medicine.  When she starts off the commercial going, I'm Sally Field and I have osteoporosis.  Oh, no, Sally, no.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  I take Boniva.  Oh.  And then they show her doing some half-assed yoga to try to, like, show that she's trying 
[03:06:00]  to stay fit.  She's got old graham cracker bones.  Why do all men just like young girls?  Yeah.  Exactly.  God.  And once you get older and it's not good enough for you.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  Older women are still just as sexy as, you know, 19-year-olds.  Are they really?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  The snare drum ass just doesn't compete with fucking blotches and skin tags.  I always thought calcium and vitamin D and exercise would keep my bones healthy, but 
[03:06:30]  I got osteoporosis anyway, so my doctor started me on once-monthly Boniva, and he told me  something important.  Didn't we say it was because of Burt Reynolds' fist?  We used to make that go, really.  So many bones were shattered from Burt Reynolds giving up body blows.  It's not hereditary.  You just picked the wrong guy to go out with for a while.  I never punched you in the face.  That's funny.  Yeah, just fucking, she can't even take it all up.  Burt Reynolds, you have more broken bones than Evel Knievel. 
[03:07:00]  Ow!  Once-monthly Boniva.  We can end this sadness with Kelly McGillis.  Kelly McGillis.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Have you seen this, Tom Papa?  No.  You don't know what Kelly McGillis looks like these days.  You remember her from Top Gun?  Of course.  Tom Cruise's love interest?  Yeah.  You will not believe what she looks like today.  Oh, it's bad.  No.  That's her.  Now, how do you look at, like, Tom Cruise is doing Mission Impossible movies.  He looks great.  He was in Top Gun.  Kelly McGillis, also in Top Gun. 
[03:07:30]  She looks 70 years old.  It makes no sense.  The power of Scientology.  Yeah, that is.  She at least is starting to grow her hair out a little bit.  Wow.  Now, let's get the picture.  No, up, up one, over one.  There.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  That was Kelly McGillis from Top Gun.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Take my looks away.  And show Tom Cruise today and yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  Where's Tom Cruise from? 
[03:08:00]  Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise.  Top Gun.  And then Tom Cruise went out.  He looks better.  He looks great.  He's getting better.  The guy looks fantastic.  How the fuck did that have?  Literally getting better.  And Top Gun.  Slightly different.  Slightly different.  He just looks a little more mature.  Oh, my God.  She looks fucking ancient.  Show George Clooney in ER and George Clooney now.  Right.  There you go.  Oh, man.  Wow. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, shit.  I didn't even see that picture.  Look at that.  There's a picture of Kelly McGillis and Tom Cruise from 1986, Top Gun.  And 2010.  He looks fantastic.  Notice the first picture.  They're kind of holding each other.  The second picture.  Not so much.  He's patting her on the back like she's a dude.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, bro.  The look in her eyes.  Oh, shit.  She knows what picture this is going to end up next to.  Right.  That one.  This wasn't a good idea.  Now, was it?  He's just his hair has grown out a little more. 
[03:09:00]  He is in better shape.  He looks a little more gruff and manly.  His nose grew a lot.  He's more muscle.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, man.  It's hard to be a girl.  You women have it.  It's hard to be a girl.  You're a dunsky.  It really is hard.  With that, we're going to say goodbye for today.  Oh, man.  Where are we going?  Time flies.  Wait, fellas.  I thought we were just getting started.  What happened?  I thought we were going to.  Let's do another hour for fun.  Funsies.  Let's get in the car.  Let's go find our friends.  Sam, why do you want me to talk about the Kings? 
[03:09:30]  What?  Yeah, yeah.  It's world champion Floyd Money Mayweather.  You know, he's never faced a defeat.  And then there's Miguel Cato, the pride of Puerto Rico.  He wears the super welterweight crown.  And on May 5th, kingdoms are going to collide as Mayweather steps up in weight to clash with  world champ Cato for his super welterweight title.  Oh, yes.  Live from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.  Plus, how about Mexican phenom and champion Canelo Alvarez battling the legendary Sugar  Shane Mosley.  And everything's on the line. 
[03:10:00]  One night, one ring, four kings.  Don't miss Ring Kings.  Mayweather versus Cato.  Saturday, May 5th, 9 p.m., 6 p.m.  Pacific time.  Live on pay-per-view.  And don't miss the finale of 24-7 Mayweather Cato.  Friday, May 4th at 8 p.m.  Eastern and Pacific.  And that's only on HBO.  HBO.  Tom, what do you got?  I'm sure you got something very exciting.  Your comedy album disc thing.  Yeah, if you want to listen to my jokes, I'm on iTunes and Tom Papa Live in New York City. 
[03:10:30]  Other than that, I'm just here to have some fun.  Here to have some fun.  What a great fun day.  Thank you, Tom.  It really was a good day.  Always a pleasure to have you in.  It's over.  The delight.  It was a delight.  I'm going to get the fuck out of here.  We've got to do this again tomorrow, by the way.  You don't have to.  I might sleep in.  Oh, me and Roland at Bruce Springsteen tonight.  Oh, man.  That's awesome.  I think we've got to leave now.  Oh, man.  I'm jealous.  Roland wants to be there now.  Where is it?  In Newark?  Oh, it doesn't matter. 
[03:11:00]  The show doesn't start for 10 hours.  I think we're leaving now.  What?  The potential center of the PNC?  You have time to go to the restroom.  The one in Central Jersey?  Newark.  By the way, there's been three, maybe two, giant panda farts while you guys were doing the  ads and stuff.  Oh, really?  It just comes right next to me.  Terrible.  Long, wet panda.  Oh, God.  And this is the one he gets in his face after.  And he giggles and looks at you like, what are you going to do about it? 
[03:11:30]  You can't do anything.  It is fucking annoying.  Oh, Roland.  Stinky person.  Oh, Roland.  Oh, boy.  Smells like a stinky DM.  Are you still in the air?  Of course.  I'll look forward to everybody on Twitter tonight.  Look forward to seeing who's DMing who.  How that goes, don't you, everybody?  Dirty, dirty business. 
[03:12:00]  Dirty fucking business.  Holy shit.  Don't, don't, don't, don't do it.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  Okay, okay.  I really shouldn't.  I really shouldn't.  I really shouldn't.  I did it.  Fucking vulture.  It's the vulture looking for scraps.  Looking for someone else's fucking eaten carcass.  Holy shit.  How's that carcass?  Still warm.  Yeah, still warm.  Swoop in and grab a chunk of meat. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, brother.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  All right.  Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I get it.  Oh, this would be bad if I, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Dead, dead, dead, shit.  Oh, God.  Well, thanks, fellas.  This was fun.  Thanks, Tom Papa.  Enjoy the concert tonight.  Stay tuned for the shit show or the after show, whatever it's called.  I don't know.  Yeah, what do you got planned today?  What is it?  What big celebrity are you interviewing?  What breaking news will you get from the staff that didn't come in during our show and reveal the exciting things? 
[03:13:00]  Young Sam, you're not going to be mad about this one.  What do you got?  I found out while the show was on today that Roland has Taylor Hicks calling into the after show.  Taylor Hicks?  Wow.  That's pretty, that's huge because last time he called in, Jay Moore called everyone a cunt.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  It's one of my favorite Jay Moore moments ever.  Can you play that real fast, D-Rock?  It's a good one.  It was a quick minute phone call because I guess they were telling us that that was it with Taylor Hicks. 
[03:13:30]  We had two minutes with the guy and then Jay Moore went off.  This is going to be another quick one today, too.  Can you get to the meat of the fucking phone call?  I didn't mind Taylor Hicks back when he was doing his idol thing.  Yeah.  He's a bust, but.  He's in Vegas now.  Are you going to explain, are you going to ask him why he's a bust?  Oh, man.  I'll probably word it differently.  I'll probably word it differently.  Don't treat him like he's a real fucking superstar.  No.  He fell extremely short.  Definitely. 
[03:14:00]  He has his own show in Vegas now.  Don't give him the Cal Ripken Jr. treatment.  Well, Cal Ripken.  Jeez.  You mean baseball legend?  Yes.  Baseball legend that you interviewed yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you treated him with the reverence and respect that you should when today, maybe  not so much.  Not as much.  Today's he's home in his studio?  No, he's on the phone.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's what I'm saying.  Wow.  You really are taking our shit, aren't you?  This one is...  You are our restroom.  Make sure you take our hotline phone calls.  Oh, yes.  I do like calling occasionally from the road. 
[03:14:30]  It's at 10.30, so you'll have...  10.30?  10.30.  Home by then.  Home by then.  What?  Fucking...  Still doesn't beat Loverboy, but...  Loverboy was great.  I loved that one.  The best.  I asked if the singer ate the rest of the band.  Nice red pants, faggot.  Faggot.  Why am I still here?  Are we waiting for something?  Riddle me that.  Just having fun.  You're right.  There's no fun.  Check my DMs. 
[03:15:00]  Keep bringing those up.  Yeah, I will.  Why don't you play the Taylor Hicks one last time to set up the Taylor Hicks for now?  The good thing about DMs is they're private.  We'll do that.  Until somebody says something.  Until somebody doesn't want to get them.  And tells other people.  So many details.  So many details.  One day.  Can't wait for that one.  That's going to be a good day. 
[03:15:30]  That will be a great day.  Awesome.  All right, I'm getting out of here.  Have fun.  I'll be listening, of course.  You better do good.  I'll report you.  We're done.  All right.  Well, you guys have a good day.  Eric, we don't have that clip now?  The thing is 22 minutes.  I'm skimming through to try to find it.  All right.  We'll hit the break, and then we'll play it during the after show.  All right.  So I'll hit it.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  The European Anthony Show is pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, After ONA Live is next. </pre>
