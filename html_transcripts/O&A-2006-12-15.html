<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily centered around their upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree" at the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey, near a Mexican restaurant possibly called Q-Dova.  The show began with typical crude and sexually explicit banter, immediately establishing the show’s tone.  A significant portion was dedicated to repeatedly playing and mocking a karaoke entry from a woman named Pamela singing "I Saw the Sign,"  with clips played throughout the broadcast.  Pamela herself later called in, discussed her MySpace page, and was invited to perform live in the studio.

Jim Norton was present in the studio.  The hosts received and read numerous complaints, primarily orchestrated by Matt Noyes from the AIDS Housing Corporation, who opposed the Homeless Shopping Spree, especially the provision of alcohol to homeless participants.  They also addressed a critical Boston Globe article, responding with insults and mockery towards Noyes, defending the event as entertaining and beneficial to the participants who would receive gifts and money.  They even played a vintage commercial for an appetite suppressant called "AIDS."  The hosts repeatedly used offensive and crude language throughout the discussion, emphasizing that they would be broadcasting live from the event.

The Homeless Shopping Spree plans were detailed, including around 10-12 homeless participants, additional participants from WYSP in Philadelphia (Matt and Huggy called in), a "Bring Your Own Bum" listener initiative, and the potential complication of a participant's pit bull.  Fez from the Ron and Fez Show (who also called in) was invited, and matching outfits were suggested.  The show also discussed the negative reception of Kid Chris’s comedy show at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia, where Bonnie (Rich Voss's wife) and Colin Quinn were heckled, prompting concern about future events in the city.

The hosts promoted their new XM Satellite Radio commercial (available on opianthony.com and YouTube), anticipating negative reactions.  They also showcased a video of Opie’s push-up contest with a soldier.  A lengthy discussion ensued regarding Rosie O'Donnell's apology for mimicking the Chinese language, debating the offensiveness of such imitations and comparing it to other forms of racial humor, including the use of racial slurs.  Frustration with John Liu's response was also expressed.

The show featured numerous listener calls, covering the "ching chong" controversy, childhood teasing, a caller's jail sentence, and various opinions on the Homeless Shopping Spree.  Several comedic moments stemmed from the hosts' interactions with callers and their off-color humor.  A MacBook karaoke contest featured contestants Kim, Josh, and Will, with Colin calling in to hilariously react to Will’s performance of "Take On Me."  The hosts also played and discussed a surprisingly powerful song submitted by a homeless man, "Gray Wolf," despite its crude lyrics.

Brother Elmo provided football predictions, and the show promoted a New Year's Eve event at the Borgata Casino.  "Scary news teases" were presented satirically.  Doug called in to discuss efforts to get radio stations to air the show live during the Homeless Shopping Spree.  A segment focused on a new Opie and Anthony commercial, and a "walk-over" to the studio allowed for more interaction with listeners and offensive jokes.  The hosts interacted with "Half a Hulk Face," who took paid photos with listeners.

Another segment discussed their new XM commercial, focusing on the fake studio and frustration with the lack of a proper one.  A caller, Anthony from Brooklyn, took offense at the use of Italian-American accents, drawing a parallel to racial slurs.  This sparked a linguistic analysis of "bukkake" and a discussion of offensive language in different contexts. The hosts contrasted their stricter FM radio regulations with their previous satellite radio freedom.  An Italian-American themed parody of Adam Sandler's Hanukkah song, filled with offensive jokes and ethnic stereotypes, was played and discussed.

The show also featured a detailed account of a Brazilian aviation accident based on a news report and Anthony’s simulator knowledge.  Finally, a segment involved the studio audience anonymously submitting and the hosts reading confessions of their "kinkiest" sexual experiences, ranging from playful to explicitly sexual acts, described in graphic detail.  This was followed by a segment featuring listener-submitted sexual anecdotes, with descriptions of various sexual encounters in unconventional locations and a wide range of sexual acts, along with sexually explicit discussions and vulgar language.  One listener described a “seven sum” involving toes and a slip and slide, and another detailed his daily masturbation habits.  A particularly graphic story involved a man paying a woman to defecate in his mouth.  Jay, a caller, unexpectedly echoed the hosts' phrases, leading to further ribald commentary. The show concluded with the "F.U. Line" segment, featuring highly offensive messages from listeners to people they disliked.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Every cell is dead.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim, so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage, and then eventually everything just stops.  The virus is spreading. 
[00:00:30]  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a whore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee.  Ovi.  O, do you want to play?  Edmonton.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing. I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for. 
[00:01:00]  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Ovi and Anthony Jove.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And...  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  There it is.  Can I start with this?  Please.  Please.  I hope it's what I think it is.  Yeah.  Good morning and welcome to the Ovi and Anthony show.  A new life you would hardly recognize.  I'm so glad.  A new person. 
[00:02:00]  I'm here with you.  A dear father.  You're not the one for me.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Isn't us enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up. 
[00:02:30]  To get into the lights where you belong.  Where do you belong?  You know, I'm on this dopey show.  Yeah.  And I was searching for that clip last night at home.  I wanted to hear it again so bad.  And there have been so many requests on message boards to get a link to it somewhere.  Yeah.  I mean, I know we've been doing the karaoke contest for the Mac all week.  And we've had a lot of winners and losers and good ones and bad ones.  But that one seems to be the one people have just embraced as some of the most horrific singing ever. 
[00:03:00]  And you just can't get it out of your head.  And you want to hear it again.  Why isn't it on our website?  It's got to be put up.  Please get that up.  Someone get that on our website immediately.  Openanthony.com  I know on Whack Bag last night, a lot of people requesting a link to that song.  That chick is all I think about.  It is fantastic.  We were walking around the house yesterday.  I saw the swine.  Saw the swine.  You can't stop singing it like her. 
[00:03:30]  It's a hit.  I saw the swine.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the swine.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the swine.  And it opened up my eyes.  It saw the swine.  No one's going to drag you up.  You get into the lights where you belong.  I'll be here to you blind.  My new favorite part is where she gets breathy at the end.  And then she's just blowing into her mic. 
[00:04:00]  I just can't get past this.  This is your whine part.  It's great.  How many people set their alarm for 6 a.m.  And this is what they're hearing.  That's it.  And they should be thankful.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the swine.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the swine.  And it opened up my eyes.  It saw the swine.  My favorite right there.  It's all the swine.  It's the lights where you belong. 
[00:04:30]  I miss you.  You belong.  Ah, she's great.  And with that, we say good morning.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Then we got to get that up on opianthony.com.  All right.  It'll be up in about an hour.  Please.  Maybe sooner.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  The ONA virus.  Spreading across America.  We got lots to talk about today.  We got lots to do today.  Where do we start? 
[00:05:00]  Where do we start?  Well, homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  I want to remind everyone of that.  Yes.  I mean, it's going to be what time?  When do we start?  Yeah.  We're broadcasting live from 2 to 6 p.m. tomorrow from the Free FM studios here in New York City.  And Philadelphia is picking up the homeless shopping spree live.  Very good.  So, for all you people listening to us on WISP, you'll be able to hear the homeless shopping spree tomorrow afternoon.  And we've already gotten some positive press because of our helping the homeless. 
[00:05:30]  That's right.  You know, we're so charitable on this show sometimes.  And people pick up on that and just give us kudos.  That's right.  I also misspoke yesterday on the show.  I was kind of frustrated at WBCN up there in Boston because I'm like, why wouldn't they pick up the homeless shopping spree live?  They love us up there.  They absolutely love the show.  They support the show.  And I couldn't understand it. 
[00:06:00]  It was a technical thing they were waiting for.  So, they didn't want to commit officially.  But they were doing everything they can behind the scenes.  And it's now official, WBCN will also be running the homeless shopping spree live tomorrow afternoon when we do it from 2 to 6 p.m.  By the way, it's at the Short Hills Mall.  So, for everybody in the New York area and the Philly area, I think a lot of people from the Philly area will make the trip up.  It's at the Short Hills Mall from 2 to 6 p.m.  Your job, show up, support the homeless, help them shop, and behave yourselves. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Have a good time.  Have a good time.  With that said, there's a guy in Boston.  I've got to find the emails, too, because the PD up there, Dave from WBCN, he sent me some terrific emails.  But basically, we were talking about the homeless shopping spree yesterday on the show.  And Dave writes me later in the day.  He goes, something's up.  He goes, I've gotten hundreds and hundreds of complaint emails about the homeless shopping spree. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, shut up.  And when you all of a sudden get, like, hundreds and hundreds of complaint emails, it usually means it's one guy trying to rally the troops.  Rally his organization.  Rally his organization.  Because he's reading these emails, and it's obvious by the emails that most of these people don't even know who we are.  Yep.  Have no clue we're broadcasting on a station in Boston.  Right.  They were just told to write an email.  Usually it's a website that has a form you can download.  And all you've got to do is sign it and send it off in another email or agree to it and email it to somebody else. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  People, like I said, they don't know what we do.  No clue.  But he goes, I just want to bring this to your attention that someone is being a troublemaker out there and rallying the troops.  And then I find out that, I guess we made the Boston Globe today.  And they also tried to contact little Jimmy Norton, matter of fact.  Did they?  The guy from the Globe emailed me, which was the first I heard of this silliness.  So I just sent him a one-word response back about, you know. 
[00:08:00]  One word?  Oh, I would have had two words.  That's douche.  No, one sentence.  Oh.  What are you going to say?  Who cares if the guy's mad?  Matt Noyes.  Matt Noyes.  Well, you know, first.  He's fuming from this article.  He says fumed Matt Noyes.  If he's that pissed off, can we get him on the air today?  Get him on the air.  I'm sure he's so pissed off that he set his alarm for 6 a.m.  so he can see what we have to say today.  So, Matt, why don't you give the show a call and we can discuss this.  We can discuss this today. 
[00:08:30]  We don't hide.  Going to discuss it with you.  Come on.  Is this the long version of the article or is it the same one I got in front of me?  Opie and Anthony's latest stunt draws ire.  Ire.  Ire.  Ire.  Pirates are annoyed.  Draws ire.  Ire.  Ire.  Ire.  Ire.  Why should they be given a bottle of rum?  Ire.  Ire.  Ire.  Opie and Anthony's latest stunt draws ire.  Opie and Anthony are drawing fire from local homeless advocates. 
[00:09:00]  No, one guy.  Local homeless advocates?  It's one guy.  Who are...  It's fuming matinoias.  Who are upset about the talk show host's latest tasteless stunt.  I think our stunts are tasty.  We add extra sugar to make them sweet.  We bring attention to the homeless.  Excuse me.  To tell you the truth, I only start...  That wreckage.  I only start listening at 6.30, so I don't even know if it was good. 
[00:09:30]  That's okay.  All right.  Opie and Anthony are drawing.  What'd you say?  I'm just laughing that he doesn't even start listening until 6.30.  That's true.  And no, I won't say it again.  I didn't hear it.  I don't care.  You know what?  Listen to the replay.  I got to tell you, I'm dying over here.  I need another cup of coffee.  One more cup of coffee and I'm right with you guys.  Yeah?  I'm right there.  Maybe it's not you.  Maybe the board needs a cup.  Why don't you just dump it into the...  Ooh.  All right.  Opie and Anthony's latest stunt draws. 
[00:10:00]  Opie and Anthony are drawing fire from local homeless advocates who are upset about the  talk show host's latest tasteless stunt.  The AIDS Housing Corporation.  AIDS Housing Corporation?  How low can you go?  Is that the AIDS, like the disease AIDS, or is that an acronym for something else?  It would be the AIDS.  Because we all remember there was an AIDS diet plan.  Oh.  And that was just chocolate that made you lose weight.  Do we have the commercial for the AIDS chocolate from the old days? 
[00:10:30]  So the AIDS Housing Corporation.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That could be like something else.  Could be something for homeless people.  Could be AIDS, the disease.  It has to be the disease.  They would have changed it by now to something else.  Yeah.  The Hepatitis Housing Corporation.  Hey, can we play the old commercial?  I love this thing.  Oh, my favorite.  This used to run on TV.  Yeah.  AIDS used to mean something else back in the 70s.  My mom used to get AIDS.  Your mom would eat the AIDS?  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  And she'd be mad when me and my brother and my sister would steal her AIDS.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because it looked like chocolate.  So she would eat AIDS, and you would take her AIDS and eat it, too.  We would eat my mother's AIDS.  And she would get so angry because she wanted the AIDS for herself.  Was the AIDS?  She would lose weight with AIDS.  Was the AIDS so good you would just smear it all over your face?  No, no.  I tried to get all the AIDS in my mouth.  I didn't want to waste any. 
[00:11:30]  Because to me, the AIDS was good.  Yeah.  I loved AIDS.  And I didn't know it would make me lose weight.  I just thought it was something tasty.  Weren't you too young to be eating AIDS, by the way?  Yeah.  I didn't buy AIDS.  I didn't get it myself.  I was given AIDS by my mother.  She brought AIDS into the house.  And, you know, we all partook.  We all, me, my brother, my sister, we all just got AIDS from my mother. 
[00:12:00]  That old gag.  Enough about the AIDS.  You know how annoyed I was when my father left his AIDS on the seat?  I didn't see him.  I sat right down in his AIDS, and I got him all over my backside.  Isn't that awful?  You've got to clean it up.  Well, here's the commercial from back in the, I don't know, 70s.  70s, yeah.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go any place.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12. 
[00:12:30]  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite.  So you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  Is that the greatest thing ever?  I bet Matt Noyes is fuming at AIDS.  I'm sure he is. 
[00:13:00]  All right, hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Julia from New Jersey.  Julia, what's up?  Hi, good morning.  Good morning.  What's up?  I just wanted to tell you how great it was to wake up to that song this morning.  Wasn't it?  Isn't that song so catchy?  And the way she sings it is so memorable and so, I don't know, it just ropes you in.  You want to hear it again.  You know what it is?  I know what it is.  What is it?  It's her diction.  Yeah.  She like pronounces like, and it opened up my eyes. 
[00:13:30]  Like, she pronounces like, every word.  Yeah, you really got to dissect this song, the way she does it.  Not only that, she kind of falls a little behind in the music, and she's so eager to  catch up that she really, like, comes out with the lines even louder to cover up the  fact that she's slowing down a little too much for the music.  Isn't there one point where she goes, I saw the sign, I saw the sign?  And then she catches up on the chorus.  She's plowing through it.  And not only speed-wise, but volume-wise, and that affectation on her voice-wise, it's 
[00:14:00]  brilliant.  And then she gets breathy and starts blowing into the microphone.  Yeah, then she's feeling comfy.  She's feeling comfy and thinks then she can take it down and breathy and sexy it up.  By the way, we almost missed this one.  We played this as part of the MacBook karaoke.  And then some woman yesterday called and said, uh, hello, guys, why don't you slow down a  little bit and play that song again?  There's something there.  I understand you guys are busy.  You got a full plate here. 
[00:14:30]  But, you know, remember what you did yesterday with this song.  And we did.  And now it's going to be stuck in your head all weekend long.  What if people are waking up now, right now?  Uh, well...  I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding, without understanding.  I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes.  It saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong. 
[00:15:00]  But how is it you belong?  I love it.  I got a new favorite part.  Nothing's going to drag you up.  Drag it up.  She's just like...  She's got to cut some.  I saw the signs.  You can hear where she does the breathy shoulder roll.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's rolling her shoulders backwards in a sexy fashion.  Breathy shoulder roll.  This weekend...  Batting her eyes.  This weekend, when you think, Opie and Anthony, you're going to hear this.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes. 
[00:15:30]  I saw the sign.  Her voice is cracking.  Can we get...  Do we know her?  Where is she?  Who is she?  I want to shake her hand.  I want a live version of that song in here.  Excuse me.  We talked to her and everything.  That's what I mean.  That woman yesterday really helped out the radio show.  We talked to her.  We gave her the MacBook, and we're like, all right, see you later.  And we thought it was one and done, like, whatever.  Oh, there's a rough landing.  Oh, you didn't see that yet?  Holy chimney cricket, yeah.  Side to side. 
[00:16:00]  Eek.  Coming in for a landing.  Yeah, we talked to her.  We can get her on the phone again.  Yeah, I would love to get her.  Does she live in New York?  Yeah.  I would love to get her into the studio, get the karaoke version of that song so there's  no lyrics underneath it, and just have her sing it.  Okay.  We'll get that done.  I want to see...  I picture her being kind of chubby, and I want to see her wearing, like, a one-piece outfit,  like Elvis used to wear, like in, like, 77.  Yeah, she has to be dressed up all sexy. 
[00:16:30]  In his last six months before death clothing.  Yeah, like the karate outfit.  A sequined cape and an outfit, kind of on a fat body.  You think she's fat?  A little chubby?  I'm hoping she...  Only because of the way she runs out of breath like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Popping her piece like a big person.  It could be that she's so nervous doing it.  I don't know.  I just...  I have to see this girl.  Yeah, we got to see a live performance of that.  Rob in White Plains, what's up? 
[00:17:00]  Hello, N-Words.  Hey.  Hi.  Nice people.  Every time I hear that stupid song, I get nauseous, sick to my stomach.  Really?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  You're just making it worse on yourselves.  Mike and Paramus, what's up?  It tasks me.  You ever hear how those mental cases say they have these voices in their head that told them  to kill and things like that?  Yeah.  I now have that song in my head, and now I understand where they're coming from. 
[00:17:30]  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  It's making people nauseous.  Let's say hi to Steve in New Jersey.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How you doing today?  I'm pretty good.  Good.  Little Jimmy, how about a tussle?  Hi.  Oh.  Yo, you picked the best mall to go to for this. 
[00:18:00]  That is the uppity-est mall ever.  We know.  It is terrific.  You guys are comic geniuses.  All I want to say.  I think we got a lot of new listeners, because we did a homeless shopping spree at the Short  Hills Mall back in the day.  Yep.  Yep.  And it worked perfectly.  That's why we're going back there.  Bigger and better this year.  And all you have to do is show up at the mall tomorrow from 2 to 6 p.m. and watch the  homeless shop, and we'll be broadcasting the whole thing on the radio here at Free FM  in New York City.  Much to Matt Noyes' chagrin. 
[00:18:30]  Refumed Matt Noyes.  You know what?  Now we have to kind of do it.  Dire.  Dire.  We just wanted to read this in the first break, and we didn't even do that.  We couldn't even accomplish a paragraph.  So we haven't even accomplished anything yet on the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, yes, we did.  We woke some people up to a wonderful tune.  That's right.  You know, some people wake up to songs, and it's like, it sets their mood for the day,  a lot of people.  Yeah.  Their clock, their alarm clock goes off, and it's a clock radio, and they hear a song, and  they like it, and they're kind of humming it while they're driving to work. 
[00:19:00]  And all day, all day, you hum the song, don't you?  Get that one out of your head.  Speaking of which.  Yes?  Here she is, Pamela.  Pamela.  Hey.  You're a star today, Pamela.  I really feel like one.  I'm a D-list celebrity, almost.  I am, uh, I'm a little nervous talking to her.  Pam, you're all I think about.  Yeah.  That's really sweet, actually.  We blew off Frank Stallone to talk to you.  You know that, right? 
[00:19:30]  She's got a better singing style than Frank.  And her brother has more dignity.  Pamela, uh, the cover is fantastic.  I couldn't get it out of my head.  It's, it's requested all over message boards, and, um, did you know you were making,  I, I, I know that a lot of people, like, um, uh, have been asked, like, uh, Led Zeppelin,  the members of Zeppelin were asked if maybe when they wrote Stairway and were performing  it, if they knew it was going to be such a classic hit, uh, did you know when you were 
[00:20:00]  recording this that it was going to be such a huge sensation?  I, I really had no idea, actually.  No?  No clue.  Wow.  Where are you from, Pamela?  I'm from Deer Park, Long Island.  Deer Park, Long Island.  That's right in the middle of it.  Oh my God, is that perfect?  That's right in the middle of it.  That is perfect.  As far as the Long Island accent goes.  Like, you people in Boston, you think you have a pretty bad accent, and you do.  But I think Long Island, uh, you know, takes the cake, man. 
[00:20:30]  Long Island, yeah.  It's just the worst accent, especially when you get south of the Long Island Expressway.  It's like the Mason Dixon line, the expressway on Long Island.  So you're from Deer Park, Long Island.  Boy, you couldn't have worked out better.  And, uh, so you, you picked that song.  Were you familiar with it?  Of course.  I only picked the greatest, you know?  Yeah.  I was like, that's a classic.  I have to just go with it, run with it.  Do you sing karaoke out?  Yeah, definitely.  Of course.  Of course.  That's a hobby, Dan. 
[00:21:00]  And you've done that?  I'm just proud of you.  Because I'm listening to your speaking voice, and, and it's a little different than your  singing voice.  Oh, definitely.  Absolutely.  Like, that's my craft.  Like, I work on that shit, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, I would assume you do.  What is that, um, octagon-shaped thing on the corner of a road that says stop on it?  What is it called?  Um, a stop sign?  A stop sign.  See, because in the song, you say sign a little different in the song. 
[00:21:30]  I swore the sign!  Soin!  Soin!  It's like, I get really into the song, so I can't control what comes out.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I think there's a longer version of that song.  There is.  Didn't you do a longer version?  Because I think what they did for the contest is just give us a piece, Anthony.  Oh, we need the whole thing.  Do we have the whole song?  I don't have the whole thing, but my friend has the whole thing, and we can definitely...  No, what did you send in for the contest?  How long, uh, was your performance?  I think we just sent in that, like, that snippet. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, no, that's not...  Well, please immediately send in the entire song.  And, uh, Pamela, now I'm curious as to what she looks like.  Yeah, me too.  I'm curious.  Please describe yourself in any way.  Maybe you could tell us the celebrity you most resemble.  Huh?  Everyone that, like, listened to it is like, this doesn't sound like what you look like.  I don't know.  I'm 21.  You're 21.  I'm not, like, ugly.  I don't know.  Do you have a MySpace account?  I do.  You want to give it out? 
[00:22:30]  Um, I don't know.  It's, like, MySpace.com slash weird numbers.  But if you, like, go to MySpace and search my name, you'll find me.  What's your name?  Well, don't give your last name.  Don't give your whole name out or anything.  Yeah, don't give your last name.  That would be bad.  There's a bunch of stalkers.  Now that you're a celebrity, you've got to watch what you do.  Maybe stalker is.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, you have three.  Oh, let me see.  I think I might have gotten something here. 
[00:23:00]  We're entering an L.  God damn it, I'm using.  Yes.  What are you doing?  Anthony's entering your MySpace.  All right.  Now, let me hit this.  Okay.  You've just popped up.  Where is she?  Let's take a look at you.  Ah, you've got to log in and look at your pictures.  MySpace stinks.  Log in, Anne.  For goodness sake, log in.  You're going to do it.  For the love of God, log in.  All right, look at her. 
[00:23:30]  Look, look, right there.  There you go.  Is she hiding behind a tree?  She's sexy.  No.  She's sexy?  You don't look bad at all.  You're really cute.  Thanks, guys.  What are you in, an elevator in that picture?  Yeah.  In the back of an elevator with a bunch of businessmen in front of you?  Why is your MySpace picture an elevator?  I was taking my security cam.  It's a black and white photo.  She's in the corner and cowering behind three armed assailants.  Wait, that's you?  Yeah.  You're too hot to be singing like that. 
[00:24:00]  I'm disappointed.  I was hoping you'd be like a fat mess.  She's really cute.  I know.  That's what it sounds like, right?  I don't know.  Yeah, you do all right there.  We'd love you to sing that someday in studio.  Would you do that?  Yeah, we do.  I'm home from college.  I'm home for winter break, so I'd love to come in.  So you'd come in and sing that song for us.  I want to sing your favorite song for you.  Which one is that?  Whatever your favorite song.  I have no idea.  That's it.  It's I Saw the Sign.  Yeah, who are you kidding?  All right, Tuesday we'll have you in. 
[00:24:30]  Tuesday.  I could do that.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Tell us a show before break.  Good.  We've got to take a quick break.  Pamela's on hold there.  We'll go to a break with her famous song.  I love her.  And we'll get into what's going on in Boston with our homeless shopping spree.  And we might need the pest to help us out.  And we want Matt Noyes.  N-O-Y-E-S.  Noyes.  I don't know.  Noyes.  Noyes.  However you pronounce that.  To call our radio show today.  He's got to be up.  If he has a problem with us and the homeless shopping spree, give us a call right now, Matt. 
[00:25:00]  Right now.  Come on.  We go to a break with this.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm your person.  I'm dreaming of you.  I don't bother.  You're not the one for me.  Is it not enough? 
[00:25:30]  I know the signs.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  It saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong.  But where do you belong?  Jingle bell.  Jingle bell.  Jingle all the way. 
[00:26:00]  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming tomorrow, December 16th from 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The crew from the Opie and Anthony Show is leaving New York City tomorrow at 2 p.m.  and bringing a bus full of homeless degenerates to the Short Hills Mall in Short Hills, New Jersey.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree.  Tomorrow, December 16th at the Short Hills Mall. 
[00:26:30]  Bye!  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, where were we?  We know it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  That much we know.  Homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  Short Hills Mall in Jersey, we're broadcasting live from 2 to 6 p.m. 
[00:27:00]  New York will hear the live show.  Philly will hear the live show.  Boston will hear the live show.  And all the XMers will hear the live show.  Maybe other stations will wake up and also carry the show live as we do it tomorrow.  Yeah, I hope so.  Boston, we love BCN.  Absolutely.  They support the show.  And there's just a guy up there causing problems.  We're attempting to cause problems.  He's getting his people together to start an e-mail campaign. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, when we last left you before the break, we were drawing arrrr.  Arrrr.  Arrrr.  Yeah, so this was in the Boston Globe today.  Opie and Anthony's latest stunt draws arrrr.  Arrrr.  Opie and Anthony are drawing fire from local homeless advocates who are upset about the talk show host's latest tasteless stunt.  The AIDS Housing Corporation is protesting the pair's plan to provide alcohol to a group of homeless folks tomorrow and then take them shopping at the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey. 
[00:28:00]  Well, you know what?  We might want to keep an open mind.  This guy might have a good point.  Look, how about this?  If we're calling him, we're calling him.  If he can find a legitimate reason as to why this should not be done, then we shouldn't do it.  If he has a legitimate reason, then maybe we shouldn't do it.  Yeah.  Let's talk to him.  Where is he?  Where is he?  It's a little early, but we're trying to get him on the phone.  It's a very important issue.  He's really fuming about it, is what the paper says.  He should be available.  But, yeah, I'm sure he's monitoring us today because he made a big to-do about this. 
[00:28:30]  What to-do?  I'm sure he's going to listen to the entire show today to hear what we had to say about it.  Hey, it's Saturday.  Everyone likes a nice little belt.  And as far as the alcohol is good.  It's Saturday before you go shopping.  You think you could take that goddamn holiday mall shopping crap without a couple of shots, maybe?  It makes the shopping go a little easier.  It makes you pick some gifts that maybe you wouldn't normally pick for a loved one.  It gets you out of the mall quicker. 
[00:29:00]  And I've got to tell you, we promised a homeless alcohol.  Yeah, we did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They said they wouldn't go unless they had alcohol.  Hey, Matt.  So we said, okay, we will provide the alcohol.  Here's a little tidbit of info.  The homeless people that we know, they like to drink.  And there's no stopping them.  There's no stopping them.  I would say we know more about the homeless than you do.  We know what they like.  We've tried.  We've tried.  We're like, just stop drinking. 
[00:29:30]  We've watched some of these guys go into rehab and clean their act up.  Guess what?  Doesn't last too long.  The homeless we know, they want to drink.  And they want to drink heavily.  And the most important part of this whole thing, we've seen them sober.  They're not funny.  They're tragic.  Oh, they stink.  When they have some booze in them, they become a little more fun.  You have to give them.  They're not homeless because they ate too much wheat germ.  Of course they love booze.  Had too many smoothies.  What happened?  I was reading too much.  I forgot to pay my bills. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  So it's tomorrow at the Short Hills Mall.  Yes, we are providing alcohol to a group of homeless folks tomorrow.  They're of age.  Uh, WBCN will preempt its regular Saturday programming.  Wow.  To broadcast Opie and Anthony's so-called, it's not so-called, it's called, homeless shopping spree.  Why did they write so-called?  When it's actually called.  It's called the homeless shopping spree.  You can't just say so-called. 
[00:30:30]  We take the homeless on a shopping spree.  It's called the homeless shopping spree.  So-called.  How about allegedly, too?  Why don't you throw that in?  Yeah.  The allegedly homeless shopping spree.  Yeah.  Uh, I'm trying to find the email here, because I got some terrific emails about this.  Anyway, um, continuing on.  Here's his quote.  Uh, this is perverse entertainment, fumed, Matt Noyes. 
[00:31:00]  Fumed.  Matt N-O-Y-E-S.  Is it Noyes?  Noyes.  Noyes.  You're right.  Matt Noyes.  Just Noyes.  He's making noise for his last name.  Noyes.  Of the AIDS Housing Corporation.  In response, BCN marketing man Larry Chachi.  So-called Chachi.  LaPrent had this to say.  Could be one of the greatest quotes ever.  It's been known for some time that the Opie and Anthony show isn't for everyone. 
[00:31:30]  That's why he's in charge up there.  That's a nice defense.  That's really standing tall right in front of us.  Way to go, Chachi.  You ain't getting to them until you get through me.  Hey, a lot of people don't like them.  Well, how do you think poor Chachi feels?  It's like he's been forced to defend cancer.  All right, we're talking about cancer, but we need you to sign with the tumors.  He might as well have said, look, man, I got a mortgage to pay.  I mean, I just come to work.  Look, I don't like them either. 
[00:32:00]  Quite frankly, I agree with you, Matt.  I know they're scumbags.  Get in line.  Boston is the one city that just no matter what we do, if we try to get a little out there with something, they're the one city that really comes to bat.  Somebody will always come up and try to shut us down or be upset by what we're doing.  Right.  The Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Remember that? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  The National Organization of Women up there and different interest groups, the gay groups.  We had to sit down and meet with a gay group up there because stupid Brucey Mittman, our old GM, decided it would be a good idea to have a sit down and have a little sensitivity training with a gay gentleman about how we were addressing gay relationships on the air during a show. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, good.  And then we sat there and they handed out pamphlets.  We were sitting in the office.  I swear I had to.  I was almost laughing.  Me and Opie couldn't look at each other or we would just bust out laughing.  But they're handing out pamphlets about like, you know, Dave tells his parents he's gay and how hard it is to tell them.  You forgot the list of books they wanted us to read to educate ourselves on the plight of the homo.  Homo shopping spree.  Yeah.  Ah.  Next year. 
[00:33:30]  And we had to sit there and always in Boston.  Yeah.  And then they left and then Bruce Mittman, one of the greatest GMs we've ever had.  He goes.  Oh, yeah.  All right, boys.  Get back in there and make fun of the fabulous.  Make fun of the fabulous, boys.  Fagulous?  Yeah, fagulous.  He used to wear like three or four hats.  He would be your pot friend if we were doing a show somewhere in Boston.  Yeah.  He would have to wear the GM hat where he had to be tough, played by the rules guy. 
[00:34:00]  But we knew what he was all about.  Yeah.  Like the second we left these meetings and things that we had to do to atone for our sins, he'd be the first one.  Boys, good job.  Now go get in there and make fun of the fagulous.  And continue doing exactly what you're doing.  What you're doing, boys.  I just had to scold you in front of them so I don't lose any hat dollars.  But you just keep doing what you're doing.  I think it was pretty tasteless when he offered them those little inflatable tire tubes to sit on when they came in. 
[00:34:30]  I thought you boys might be in a little pain.  Well, that's what made the paper.  But I got a lot more on this, Anthony.  Do you?  Yeah.  This is Dave.  Dave Wellington, the program director of WBCN.  So on another note, once we announced that we're airing the ONA homeless shopping spree, I began to get calls, calls and e-mails complaining.  I thought that was really odd.  I'm not talking a few e-mails, but over a hundred e-mails. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, boy.  I felt that this was all coming from an e-mail blast to workers at shelters and churches.  Now I know.  Matt Noyes, N-O-Y-E-S, from the community advocacy coordinator, is responsible for sending this out.  The e-mails are multiples from individuals.  These are not typical WBCN listeners judging by the responses.  The e-mails are all scripted the same.  Do not air Opie and Anthony's dehumanizing, perverse, and degrading homeless shopping spree.  Oh, that just meant the show. 
[00:35:30]  This type of program has no place on our radio.  I don't like to be bullied or pushed by a few that normally do not even listen to us.  God bless you, Dave Wellington of WBCN.  No backing down.  I like it.  I disagree, Dave.  I think they make a good point, and we should back out right now.  Jim, I'm with you.  That's just my two cents.  I don't want Matt Noyes on me.  And then he writes, I thought that you may want to address or contact this guy.  Info is below.  Oh, we have a contact.  Well, we're calling him, right?  Yeah, the boys are trying to get him on the phone.  Well, we want to hear a legitimate reason. 
[00:36:00]  We are up for discussion on it.  We're not going to be crazy.  We are up for discussion.  We got him?  No, no, no.  It's funny.  You got this number right here?  Yes, yes.  No.  Hurry.  Because I got the e-mail he's been sending out to everybody.  Good.  This is what we do.  You relax.  Don't be fumed.  All right.  I got my blackberry back.  Don't go off fuming.  Okay.  So this guy, Matt, writes, please feel free to distribute this far and wide. 
[00:36:30]  This guy is trying to get us in trouble.  Oh, dehumanization has no place on Boston Radio.  This coming weekend, WBCN Boston is planning to broadcast an event that degrades and humiliates  homeless individuals for the perverse amusement of the listening audience.  How about they're getting stuff?  They're getting all kinds of things.  Did you hear that one store is supplying the homeless?  I don't remember the name of the store. 
[00:37:00]  I'm sorry.  I got in a quick e-mail.  We'll remember tomorrow.  Yeah.  But the homeless with backpacks and little insulated cooler things for their...  Dan, I'm talking out my...  Why don't you inform the people?  Sure.  The store is Innovation Luggage.  Innovation Luggage.  Yeah, and they're giving them a pack and then some sort of cooler thing to store food in.  Yeah, to store food in and a backpack.  How about a giant suitcase they could live in?  That would be nice.  People don't understand.  The homeless aren't going to have rocks thrown at them. 
[00:37:30]  The people, they become these cult figures on the show and people like them.  We make them celebrities over the course of the year between shopping sprees.  We have homeless on.  They're brought into the studio.  We talk with them.  Yeah, we give them some beers.  They like to drink.  Sorry.  That's reality.  You're delusional.  They like to drink.  Some of these homeless guys, we've talked to them.  And I know you probably talk to homeless people too.  But we talk to them like real humans. 
[00:38:00]  We're not trying to counsel them.  We just get into their heads and see what the hell they're thinking.  Some of them want help and get help.  Some of them have.  Some of them have gotten off the streets.  Others are lost causes.  They will just remain homeless.  It's what they enjoy.  It's what they do.  Yeah, we've asked them.  We've asked them.  They don't want to be cleaned up.  They don't want to be cleaned up.  We've tried.  Other people have tried.  It doesn't work.  So what's the next best thing you can do?  Give them what they want. 
[00:38:30]  They want a little drink.  They want some warm clothes for the winter.  They want something.  They want to go shopping.  They want acceptance.  They want a day that's just for them.  There are going to be thousands of people cheering these guys when they come off of that bus.  Not like Jimmy said, throwing rocks at them.  They're going to be treated like celebrities.  They're going to be given money and merchandise the whole day.  What's so wrong with that, you idiot?  Why don't you do a little research on how this goes every year before you just bash us 
[00:39:00]  because you go off half cock thinking we're going to treat them poorly.  We give them a human face, by the way.  Yeah.  We really do.  You get to really learn about the homeless throughout the year.  You get to know them as the people that they really are.  Oh, by the way.  Are we having fun with it?  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, we don't really care about their lives.  We could give a crap.  Because we also do know good radio.  So it works for everybody.  Get a job. 
[00:39:30]  Get off the streets.  All right.  So we tell them.  Stop lollygagging in malls.  You lazy bastards.  For the perverse amusement of the listening audience,  the AIDS Housing Corporation is calling on concerned persons to contact WBCN  to urge them not to broadcast this disgusting spectacle.  On Saturday, December 16th, radio disc jockeys, Opie, Greg Hughes.  Oh.  Oh, you got something on me, Matt.  You know my real name.  Wow.  I thought you were trying to keep that from leaking out.  No kidding. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  Oh, Matt knows it, though.  His name couldn't drip out.  On Saturday, December 16th, radio disc jockeys, Opie, Greg Hughes, and Anthony, Anthony Cumia.  Oh, got me too.  We'll broadcast their annual homeless shopping spree at the Short Hills Mall in Short Hills,  New Jersey.  The Opie and Anthony radio show is a nationally syndicated show broadcast locally on WBCN  and nationally on XM Satellite Radio.  The so-called homeless shopping spree, which has been held on a number of previous occasions,  takes several homeless individuals from New York City and transports them via or via bus 
[00:40:30]  to a shopping mall in a local affluent community.  During the trip, Hughes, Cumia, and their cohorts provide alcohol to the homeless person,  give them degrading nicknames such as Tippy Tom, Sperm, and Buttered Roll.  Wait a minute.  Those are their names.  Tippy Tom is the name that he gave himself.  We didn't give them that name.  We didn't give one person one of those names.  Hey, did Al dump out of that one? 
[00:41:00]  Why would he?  He wouldn't just dump out.  I don't think he would.  It's just the guy's name.  It's just his name.  But we didn't give them those names.  Those are their street names.  They get names on the street.  And generally ridicule them on the air.  All right, that we do.  Hughes and Cumia's listeners are encouraged by the radio host to give the homeless men money.  Oh, is that horrible.  In order to get them to shop at the high-end retail stores in the mall.  The men are recorded both with audio and video equipment in the mall and are given a constant supply of liquor. 
[00:41:30]  Then they're taken back to the studio and raped.  According to the December 14th broadcast of the Opie and Anthony radio show.  So he's listening right now.  So, Matt, give us a call.  Call up.  Call up.  Come on.  What kind of balls do you really have?  Let's hash this out instead of hiding behind your stupid computer and email blast.  Your radio's talking to you, crazy person.  Call us.  According to the December 14th broadcast of the Opie and Anthony radio show, well over 2,000 people are expected at the Short Hills Mall to witness the degradation of these men. 
[00:42:00]  It's not degradation.  Just stop.  Yeah, we're having our fun.  But so are they.  They're having a good time.  A very disturbing online account of past homeless shopping spree.  Of a past homeless shopping spree is at, and this URL is so, tinyurl.com slash Y-D-J-T-9-H. 
[00:42:30]  Holy crap.  That's an easy one.  Good luck finding that.  It's just like Google.  There are many disturbing parallels to be made between the homeless shopping spree and the so-called Bum Fights video series.  No, there is.  Holy Jesus.  You're insane.  The Bum Fights videos is a couple of guys got together and decided it would be funny to get homeless guys together and have them duke it out. 
[00:43:00]  Bare knuckle fight and videotape it.  And then, I don't know, put them online?  Yeah.  Try to sell them whatever they did to them?  In all fairness, there may be a fight this year because Tippy Tom, who's homeless, gay, with AIDS, Big Red, another homeless guy, is not a fan of Tippy Tom.  Hates Tippy Tom because he kind of looks like Tippy Tom.  Looks like Tippy Tom.  And if you say to Big Red, hey, what's up, Tippy Tom?  He loses his mind.  And he already told us that he better be separated on the bus as they're going to the mall. 
[00:43:30]  If Tippy Tom tries to pick him up, there could be a brawl.  But that's not us telling him to fight.  Hey, homeless people fight on the street.  You see them always.  They're getting beat up.  It's what they do.  Boy, this is Matt's not going to like the dirt pit we have set up in the middle of the mall.  Oh, I know.  When we say fight for liquor.  It continues.  Just throw one bottle of Thunderbird in the middle.  Have him go at it.  So the homeless shopping spree is just like bum fights.  What an idiot.  In both cases, homeless individuals are portrayed as existing only for the amusement of others 
[00:44:00]  and are subjected to extreme humiliation.  I hate bum fights.  I saw that one time, and the guys that were doing bum fights, I wanted to strangle.  Yeah.  Those guys, I hate it.  I don't know why I hated those guys so much.  Currently, WBCN Boston is planning to broadcast a homeless shopping spree.  Live on Saturday, December 16th at 2.30 p.m.  In addition to a scheduled rebroadcast on Monday, December 18th from 6 to 9 a.m. 
[00:44:30]  Thank you for the advertisement.  Yeah, the rest of the radio stations that aren't picking this up live will rebroadcast it on Monday  when you usually hear the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Please contact WBCN at 617-746-1400  and ask them not to broadcast this disgusting and disturbing event on their airways.  Matt Noyes, N-O-Y-E-S, Community Advocacy Coordinator, United Disability Housing Partnership, AIDS Housing Corporation. 
[00:45:00]  Do you have an email address?  No, of course not.  Yeah.  No.  Their website is unitedhousing.org.  Oh, okay.  Go check it out.  Jesus.  So there you go.  A lot of attention in Boston.  Trying to equate it to bum fights.  Stop it.  We give them money.  We give these guys loads of money and merchandise, things they need for a cold winter. 
[00:45:30]  I don't see you, Matt.  I don't see you giving these guys coats and hats and warm booties and booze.  Someone's making a good point.  Giving them alcohol is a step up from what they usually drink.  Yeah.  See?  That's true.  What was Big Red talking about the other day?  What he used to drink.  Windex.  I don't know.  Something crazy because he couldn't get his hands on alcohol.  Yeah.  At least they're going to get some fine alcohol tomorrow.  Come on. 
[00:46:00]  It's not like that kiddie Dukakis up there in Boston spraying hairspray in her mouth to get a buzz.  We give them good booze.  Boston.  You guys lighten up a little bit.  It's not.  We love you, but Jesus Christ.  You got some lunatics up there.  It's not our listeners, though.  You got to understand that.  Oh, I know.  Boston Strangler.  What's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Half of the entire city of Boston.  I just want to apologize for this real, I don't know if I can say it on the radio, so I won't.  But we already have information about Matt Noyes. 
[00:46:30]  If you go to oaexperience.com, click on the forums.  Yeah.  All the information's up already.  Yeah, see, we, for people like Matt Noyes out there, N-O-Y-E-S, we fight back because you guys do your email blasts and you get attention and sometimes you get things done.  So we decided, well, we...  People back down.  We have our own people and we do our own email blasts and we shut down websites and we make your life a living hell right back. 
[00:47:00]  We're the first radio show to organize our listeners in such a way where we could actually fight back against losers like Matt Noyes.  You're a public advocate, so if you feel you can send out hundreds of emails and letters or whatnot to people to voice your opinion, we then turn around and find out how to get in touch with you and your constituency and we send them emails and letters and whatnot voicing our listeners' opinions.  Because it's about time someone fights back against people like this. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, it's a little exchange.  Yeah.  Have fun with it.  And by the way, most of the pests are very intelligent on how they go about this.  You're going to get some very intelligent emails.  Most or just some?  Well, yeah.  A couple?  Two people.  How about this?  Maybe four or five.  All the rest will be racial epithets, things about your sexuality.  Don't take those too seriously.  Why don't you get this from putting a homeless man's this and you're this?  Right.  Exactly. 
[00:48:00]  You might want to ignore those.  Yeah.  Just bypass those and go to the two really intelligent ones that you get.  Well, you might open one that says, I agree with you, exclamation point.  Good point, and I'm glad you're doing this.  And then when you open it, it's going to be, I hope you get some of this all over your face from a homeless man's this.  Right.  And then there could be picture attachments that you might find on some of your emails.  I want to personally apologize for those.  I don't like when I get them either.  They could be big or small, black or white. 
[00:48:30]  Absolutely.  Clipped.  Tub girl.  I mean, I've gotten tub girl.  I've gotten, I don't know what it was.  It was just two hands with a big red circle in between them.  A man was doing something with his two hands.  I couldn't just.  Wow.  Two hands in a big red circle.  Was he hanging a wreath?  It looked like a giant bleeding Christmas.  I don't know what it was.  I've seen that one.  I've opened emails that said, I'm glad you're doing this.  And then I've opened an email and seen that.  Yeah.  Three older gentlemen.  There's three older men holding each other and having sex. 
[00:49:00]  I've seen the older gentleman picture.  That is really disturbing.  Oh, my.  It's disturbing and hilarious.  Three grandpas.  Three grandpas just getting together for a little fun.  That's right.  Hugging and kissing.  Discussing the grandchildren's gifts and then to show each other how appreciative they are of their age.  How gender bending can be fun.  Listen, Boston Strangler, thank you.  OAExperience.com.  The O&A Pests are getting together to fight back a little bit.  And this douche, the website is unitedhousing.org. 
[00:49:30]  And we're hoping Matt is brave enough to at least call the radio show instead of hiding behind an email blast.  Face us if you have the courage.  Have we called him?

Let's say hi to Sherry in Boston.  Sherry, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  All right.  Hi.  Speak.  I think this guy has got to be some kind of a transplant out of the city. 
[00:51:00]  He probably is not even from here.  Why do you think that?  Matt, he's trying to shut us down as far as the homeless shopping spree goes tomorrow?  Yeah.  I mean, you guys are doing it.  I mean, it's an awesome thing.  It's funny, yeah.  But, I mean, what the hell?  They're not going to get...  It's not like they're going to really probably have a brighter Christmas.  So, I mean, this guy needs to lighten up.  And I guarantee he's not even from the city.  Oh, the smiles on the homeless tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  It's unbelievable.  They're stars.  I almost feel like I'm doing something nice. 
[00:51:30]  They're stars.  They're rock stars tomorrow.  And they're treated as such.  Yeah.  I agree.  It's going to be our biggest homeless shopping spree yet.  You know, I got a homeless guy here when I go into work every day.  I work in Boston, and there's a dude that sits out here every day, and he has a guitar,  a big backpack, and he's here every single day.  And, you know, he doesn't look that unhappy to me.  And I bet if somebody came to him and said, look, go for a shopping spree, you know,  I'll take you up to the mall.  You can have the blues, and we'll go shopping. 
[00:52:00]  I keep you psyched.  Look at his face during one of your nice winter blasts up there in Boston.  We've been lucky.  Look at his face.  See if he's happy in that wind chill of 20 below as his guitar is burning it for firewood.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Jay.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say thanks for bringing good radio back to Boston, and I think what you  guys are doing with the homeless is great, and I just wanted to know one more time what  the information was so I could find out where the extra parking and stuff is. 
[00:52:30]  Are you going to drive down from Boston?  Absolutely.  We've got a bum that lives around the corner from me that we're going to bring with us.  Oh, my God.  People are starting to bring their own homeless.  If they're bringing their own homeless, this is just such the holiday spirit.  It's a BYOB party.  This is what it's all about.  Bring your own bum.  Bring your own bum.  You know, it's getting a little scary because usually we control it.  We get about 10 to 12 homeless people, and we treat them like rock stars for the day. 
[00:53:00]  This guy's bringing his own bum.  He's driving from Boston.  I just got off the phone with another guy from Michigan who's driving up, driving up,  driving from Michigan to go to the homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  Bringing his own bum?  No, he's not bringing his own bum, but people are traveling just to check this out tomorrow.  I would encourage you to bring it up because it's easy.  The guy only has to drive him one way because why bring him back?  Yeah, why?  It doesn't matter.  Absolutely.  He can just sit there.  He's at the Short Hills Mall.  Yeah, it's like going to Florida to this guy. 
[00:53:30]  He don't know.  It's a little warmer.  He's relocating.  He's relocating.  For business.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow, Jay.  My work takes me all over the country.  Yeah.  And all travel expenses are a write-off, so he'll pick up the tab on everything.  He wanted details really fast.  It's 2 to 6 tomorrow.  We're broadcasting live on the radio in Boston, Philly, and New York.  Yeah.  And it's at the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey as the homeless shop.  The homeless shop.  Get there a little early so you can be there for when the bus pulls up.  It's an amazing sight.  Oh, yeah.  When the homeless is announced to the crowd.  It's like the Rolling Stones tour bus pulling up. 
[00:54:00]  Kenny said that the bus pulls up near a Mexican restaurant.  Do we know the name of that restaurant?  Anybody?  Well, can we find out so we can tell people where to be at the home?  Why would we know?  We don't know.  We should know since yesterday.  Wherever the crowd starts gathering, they'll figure it out.  Let's say hi to Matt from Matt and Huggy from WYSP in Philly, Philadelphia,  also broadcasting the homeless shopping spree live.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, how you doing?  We got a bum for you.  I see.  You got a bum.  He has a dog, though.  Is that cool?  He's a what?  He has a dog.  What do you mean he's a dog?  He has a dog.  Oh, he has a dog. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, he has a dog.  They want to let him in.  Yeah, the dog might be a problem.  Is he blind?  A dog can shop, but the bum cannot.  But he's so cute.  His name's Scraps.  The bum?  Scraps?  Now, wait a minute.  Of course it's a pit bull, right?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  And is he blind, and is this a guide dog?  Because that's the only way he'd be allowed in the mall with a pit bull.  Now, the blind guy.  We had a blind guy, but I don't know.  I don't think he was homeless. 
[00:55:00]  He's only been on the streets since September.  This guy has been on the streets for, like, 20 years.  I mean, I asked him to get a babysitter for his dog, which is funny.  He's like, yeah, I can get a babysitter for my dog.  I'm like, who's babysitting your dog?  Some people can't even get a babysitter.  Another homeless guy.  See, YSP took it upon themselves to get their own homeless guy, which is, I think, just awesome.  Yeah.  But you picked a guy with a dog.  That could be a problem, Matt.  I thought it was funny, you know?  It's definitely funny.  He had a little blue jacket on, like, fuzz around as a collar for the dog.  I mean, how many homeless guys have jackets for the dog? 
[00:55:30]  The dog's got a jacket to keep him warm.  Homeless guys, they're finding him dead in the city, on the streets.  Huggy-ass, guys.  I have audio, if you want to say.  I think he'll eat his dog, too, if he ever got hungry, he said.  Oh, really?  That's probably why they have it, fresh food.  He's perfect for the homeless shopping spree.  Imagine you're a dog, and all of a sudden you realize that you're going to be leaving the pet store in that crowded cage,  and it turns out a stupid homeless guy's got you.  Do you think a homeless guy is going into a pet store to find their animals?  I mean, just go with it.  Jesus, Ant.  You are right, but. 
[00:56:00]  That's great.  Excuse me, I want that one.  You know, homeless guys find their dog, they feel like someone's spraying a squirt gun in their face,  and they look up, and they say, oh, it's a dog, and he's mistaking me for some piece of garbage,  and then he pets it, and they fall in love.  So, Matt, you guys coming up tomorrow?  Yeah, I think me or Huggy is going to probably go up there tomorrow.  I don't know if we want to ride with the bum, though.  Well, that's up to you.  You know, you can transport your bum any way you want.  Okay, yeah.  He didn't seem as crazy as the other guy.  I asked this other guy, and he said he was going to kill me if I had given him $25, and I was like, I don't think you're coming with me. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, he'd be great.  That guy is good.  Perfect.  Hey, we also got to get into something maybe a little later.  I guess Kid Chris did his comedy show last night.  Yeah, I'm pretty banged up from that right now.  And I guess Bonnie got heckled really, really bad, Rich Voss' wife.  Oh, no, by Rich.  She didn't make it.  She went on stage, I guess, to do her act.  He didn't call him Quinn.  He got booed, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was up there a couple minutes.  It's a new thing to do in Philly, and you know what?  With these people.  If they continue to do that, I don't know if we could take our traveling virus down there next time. 
[00:57:00]  Wait a minute.  Colin got booed?  Yeah, Colin got booed.  He was up there for like three or four minutes, and he'd start getting booed the whole time.  How do you boo Colin?  A bunch of dopes.  I don't know.  Well, he followed Levy.  He followed Bob Levy, and Bob Levy was just yelling at everybody.  And then Colin Quinn's just a little bit low-key, doesn't yell as much.  I don't know if that was it, but it was just...  How big was the crowd?  It was big.  Where was it?  It was at the electric factory.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, Bonnie, let me just get into the Bonnie thing really fast, because we've got to move on. 
[00:57:30]  So Bonnie goes on stage to do her act, and they just start chanting,  and then show us the whole time, and she couldn't really do her act.  And then I guess it ended with her mooning the crowd when Rich Voss came back out,  because he was hosting the event.  Maybe we could get Voss on the line to explain further.  I wish we could get Colin on the line, because Colin called me the other night.  I saw him at the cellar, and he goes,  Leave me awful Voss and Levy's numbers.  I'm doing a gig with them.  So I forgot to, and he called me and screamed at me,  so I had to give him Voss' number.  So I would love to hear about his booing.  Yeah.  Actually, I stand corrected.  Good job, Philly. 
[00:58:00]  But he was a good guy.  You know, he took it pretty good.  All right, Matt.  We'll see you tomorrow for the homeless shopping spree.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for the support down there in Philly.  No problem.  Thank you.  WYSP rocks.  See you, guys.  All right, let's say hi to Ron from the Ron and Fez Show.  Ron A.  Ron.  What do you say, buddy?  How are you?  Wow, you're up a little early, huh?  I'm up late.  Oh, you're just up late.  Okay.  All right.  You know, I hear you guys taking some heat here.  Let it, just let it roll off your back.  Don't even look.  You're doing, you're like saints today for what you're doing for these. 
[00:58:30]  You know, I'm glad you actually see the good that we're doing here.  People like to, you know, pick it apart and say we're doing something bad and exploitive here.  But it's good.  I was wondering, is there any possible way I could get Fez to be part of this?  You know how he's living his life now.  If you want to call it living a life.  Exactly.  He's pathetic.  He's borderline homeless.  Yeah, there's rumors that he is actually homeless at this point.  Well, a couple of listeners saw him out at the Apple store and started taking pictures of him. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, no.  They thought he was a homeless guy who looked like Fez.  Oh, no.  Poor Fez.  He was all confused, disheveled, and they claim muttering to himself.  So, it broke his heart, but I thought maybe a new outfit could turn everything around for him.  You know something?  I'm sure the listeners would embrace Fez and probably buy him clothes that would make him look a little happier and a little more lively. 
[00:59:30]  I'm looking for church pants.  He really needs a pair of pants.  Church pants.  Is there a big and tall over at this mall?  I know it's a little high class.  I'm sure there is.  Yeah, I'm sure there's got to be something he can fit into.  Something a little wide in the waist, tight in the crotch, and the zipper in the back is always what he looks like.  Yeah.  How many homeless people altogether?  I don't know.  I think we've got about 10 to 12 again. 
[01:00:00]  But then Philly's bringing their homeless person.  A couple of listeners bringing their own.  And now Jimmy started a whole thing called BYOB, which I love.  Bring your own bum.  Bring your own bum.  And Fezzy.  You know something?  Sure.  I'd love for Fezzy to come along.  Is there any way for it?  We end the thing with matching outfits.  So, you know, they all look the same when they get back on the bus.  That would be adorable.  It really would.  They all are just dressed the same in Garanimals.  Yeah.  Just like a down on their luck in sync where everybody's, you know, not quite in sync, but a head's in that direction. 
[01:00:30]  As long as they're all dressed alike.  All right.  I also want Fezzy to pick up some cigars.  He loves them.  Wouldn't those cigars be for you, Ronnie?  You know, maybe one of those old triple beam scales.  Yeah.  Those come in handy.  Maybe some coin bags.  You know, make it a nice Christmas for them.  Yeah.  I'm writing all this down for you. 
[01:01:00]  I can see why you're up at this hour now.  Right.  You know, you're not supposed to, you're just supposed to sell it.  Yeah, I'm going to call off.  All right.  Fez joins the homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  All right.  This is great.  This is wonderful.  This is going to turn things around for him, too.  We'd love to get him out.  I think this is going to be the first time he's, although, wait a minute.  Are they taking the bridge or the tunnel?  Either way, he's frightened.  That's true.  He is so scared of bridges.  He, I was listening to you guys, and he actually had called Ronnie, because he was lost, from 
[01:01:30]  the middle of a bridge, crying his eyes out, that he didn't know what to do.  He was on a bridge, and he was scared.  Do you understand how symbolic that is?  Yeah.  Do you understand that?  A bridge.  Yeah, I know.  A bridge, maybe to another place.  Yes.  Yeah, it is very symbolic, and I'm sure a shrink could spend years studying that one.  Not really.  There's a vag on one side, a hog on the other, and he's in the middle going, yuck, and he's  being pulled like a magnet towards one, and he's guilty. 
[01:02:00]  That's a good boy.  Wow, is that a weight off his shoulders?  Thank you, doctor.  Dr. Norton, always willing to help for free.  He's doing the work.  He's taking baby steps.  Yeah, he is.  All right, Fezzy's in.  Matching outfit.  All right, Ron.  Thank you so much.  We'll see you tomorrow for the homeless shopping spree.  All right, take care.  George Hill's Ball, 2 to 6 p.m., and we'll broadcast it live in New York, Boston, and  Philly so far.  Thank you, Ronnie.  And Fez involved now. 
[01:02:30]  And the rebroadcast will be on Monday when you usually listen to this fine show.  Okay, this guy knows the entrance to where everyone's going to be hanging, I guess.  Greg in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I mean, that old Kenny said something about not being able to pronounce it.  I think he's talking about Q-Dova.  Is that a Mexican restaurant, yeah?  Yeah, there's a place called Q-Dova.  But Q-D-O-V-A.  It's like, it's one of the entrances at Short Hills, and I'm sure that Kenny can't pronounce  it if he took, you know, a year to look at it. 
[01:03:00]  All right, just look for the Mexican restaurant at the Short Hills Mall, and that's where everybody  will be.  That's the one.  Yeah, look for the fire department aiming water at someone's hair.  You know that Kenny has removed his hat too quickly.  All right, we got lots of other things to get into today.  Oh, we got announced that the TV commercial is up, and you can check it out for yourself  on opianthony.com.  Yes.  It's also up on YouTube.  It's making the rounds now.  YouTube.com slash user slash OA videos. 
[01:03:30]  Okay.  That was pretty easy.  Sure.  YouTube.com slash user slash OA videos.  That's easy.  And opianthony.com.  It's our new commercial for XM Satellite Radio.  Nice.  We love this spot.  Yes.  We love this spot.  There it is.  I can't wait to read on the message boards how awful it is and how stupid we are.  Are you kidding?  Of course somebody will say that.  A few people. 
[01:04:00]  Good.  Think up your own.  We've seen what you idiots can come up with.  Well, they're running a video contest.  We've seen the crap you morons can do.  Why are you paranoid about that?  I think they're going to love this spot.  A hundred percent?  Not a hundred percent.  Of course.  Never a hundred percent.  I'm just talking about the, you know, you get the two or three people that are just.  Naysayers.  Dude, you know, it sucks.  It's a ride.  Dude, the uncreative ass that just sits there in his house and does nothing his whole life. 
[01:04:30]  He's the one that sits there and has to do it.  You know, the thing just, I don't know.  I didn't find it funny.  I didn't find it entertaining.  It's nothing.  It's a dibby.  It's funny you say that because I was watching the YouTube video of me doing the push-ups  with the army guy.  Yeah.  Army guy comes up to us in the middle of nowhere and kind of like, kind of throws a challenge  out there.  Come on.  So I go, all right, I'll take you on.  And we did a little push-up contest right on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  And I end up doing 50 push-ups and most people, you know, kind of impressed by the whole thing. 
[01:05:00]  And then you get a guy, you know, I don't think he would have done as many if his legs  were together and if his ass wasn't so high in the air.  It doesn't matter.  There's always somebody.  You're right.  What it is that goes up on YouTube or any of the other video sites, scroll down past  the video and read the comments.  There will always be at least one or two.  It doesn't matter what it is.  It could be somebody bringing a cancer kid to the bestest ever Make-A-Wish Foundation  event that the kid could ever possibly want. 
[01:05:30]  And someone will be like, dude, that ain't that good.  You know, maybe you got about curing the kid.  That might help.  There's always a person that just cannot get into the spirit of the moment.  Right.  So I'm looking forward to reading that.  I think in general, people are going to love the spot.  Check it out for yourself.  It's up on opianthony.com.  And it's not in the search of YouTube.  That's why I'm giving this URL out.  YouTube.com slash user slash OA videos. 
[01:06:00]  It's a fine spot.  A lot different than the dress commercial we did.  What's up?  Nothing.  I just get texted.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We're going to step aside and get into some other things.  Miss America is a booze hound.  Why?  Is a party girl.  I love it.  She's 20 and hot.  What the hell do you expect?  Next time then, pick a fat slob.  There you go.  Duke rape chick had a kid or is she pregnant? 
[01:06:30]  She's pregnant.  She didn't have the kid yet?  See, the story has a happy ending.  All right.  Poor kid.  What chick?  The Duke rape victim.  Oh, Duke rape.  I think she said grape.  Duke rape.  Yeah.  Duke.  I said it too fast.  The Duke grape.  The Duke rape chick.  The Duke rape chick.  Isn't she not a rape victim?  Isn't she not a rape victim?  They said there was like three DNA.  It had nothing to do with the guy.  There's five different.  The kid's head's going to look like a golf ball.  Dense.  I thought it was pretty funny.  I guess I liked where it was coming from. 
[01:07:00]  That's all right.  Yeah.  Viciousness.  But how is it?  How is it?  All the racial allegations,  and it looks like that,  you know,  that she was lying.  Wow.  Dan's waving that sign around now.  He's waving.  He's ready to roll it up  and throw that break sign at Jimmy's head.  All right.  And also,  very depressing,  but Rosie apologized on The View.  Why?  We've been following this story for a while.  We'll get into that.  Jesus, Kramer.  And any day,  John,  John Liu,  we want him to call the show.  Let's keep calling him.  We talk to a lot of people.  Oh,  they're all brave in print.  And you have a problem 
[01:07:30]  with people making fun of  the Asian community,  so let's discuss it on our show.  Let's discuss it.  Yeah.  But so far,  he's blown us off.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jingle bell,  jingle bell,  jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree,  only on The Opie and Anthony Show,  coming tomorrow,  December 16th,  from 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The crew from The Opie and Anthony Show  is leaving New York City tomorrow 
[01:08:00]  at 2 p.m.  and bringing a bus full of homeless degenerates  to the Short Hills Mall  in Short Hills, New Jersey.  Golden buns is gonna get busy.  Immerse yourself  in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit  and the stench of booze and vomit  as we partake  in another homeless shopping spree  tomorrow,  December 16th,  at the Short Hills Mall.  Bye!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202. 
[01:08:30]  Luxury flight benefits.  That's what I need.  Luxury.  We're having a little discussion.  The PalTalk people listening in  on airlines and, you know,  a lot of emerging  or merger talks going on.  And me and Jimmy,  Opie also,  we enjoy the first class.  I like it.  And flight benefits 
[01:09:00]  is the name of the girl  on PalTalk.  And I guess she works  for JetBlue.  And she's touting JetBlue  and she goes,  well, what do you need?  You're flying two hours.  I love JetBlue.  I need luxury.  But I do love JetBlue.  They have a nice presentation  when you fly.  They really do.  And it makes everyone feel  like they're flying first class  because there's a TV  in your face.  It's right there  on the back of the seat.  I don't mind JetBlue at all.  Where, where, where, where,  where's the rabbit ears  on this thing?  Someone's joking. 
[01:09:30]  I'll talk.  Thank you.  Come on!  All right.  Come on!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Well, Rosie,  had to apologize, I guess.  What had to  or just is again,  she did already.  Why the dual apologies?  She's pulling a Kramer here.  Enough.  You said,  ching chang chang pang  because to people  that don't speak Chinese,  that's the only way  we can really imitate  the language. 
[01:10:00]  She was imitating  a language she doesn't know.  And in order to convey  that to the audience,  you have to make up sounds  that sound like the language.  I'm sure Chinese people  make up sounds  to sound like  they're speaking English  as a goof.  And they're not words.  I don't find that offensive.  But you go chang chang pang  because that's what  it sounds like.  And Rosie did it on The View  and caught some flack  from this guy.  What's his name?  John Liu.  John Liu has nothing better  to do than come to the aid 
[01:10:30]  of people that don't need help.  The Asian community.  I show them that  the Asian community is weak.  Yeah, that's what he's saying.  They need to take care  of themselves.  That's what he's saying.  They need John Liu  to look after them.  John Liu comes out  and says that it was  racist and sensitive  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So Rosie,  instead of telling him  to go scratch his ass,  says,  apologizes.  She did say it  in a kind of a way  like, look,  this is what I do.  She's a comedian. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, she's a comedian.  She's making jokes.  She's got to apologize  for some of the stuff  she says.  Not a politician.  That's really sickening.  It really is sickening.  And we want to talk  to John Liu about this.  But again,  another guy  that won't talk to us  because we're not just  going to bow down  and apologize.  We've left numerous  messages for him  at his office.  My bow if we greet him.  It's what they do.  Yes, it's a little bow.  Kind of sad  that she had to.  I asked Judy,  who's Asian, 
[01:11:30]  who works here  in our hair  and makeup department.  I said,  was it offensive to you?  She said,  well, kind of.  You know,  when I was a kid.  Of course.  Oh, come on.  It's not.  Kind of?  Kind of?  When I was a kid,  what?  What makeup girl  when you were a kid,  what?  I asked Judy,  who's Asian,  who works here  in our hair  and makeup department.  I said,  was it offensive to you?  And she said,  well, kind of.  You know,  when I was a kid,  people did tease me  by saying ching chong.  So apparently,  ching chong,  unbeknownst to me,  is a very offensive word 
[01:12:00]  or way to make fun,  quote unquote,  or mock Japanese accent.  That's what people have to call  Japanese, Chinese.  Any Asian accent.  To say ching chong  to someone  is very offensive  and some Asian people  have told me  it's as...  How is it?  Am I that stupid?  How is that offensive?  Is she going to say  it's as offensive  as the N word?  No, no, no.  No?  Is she?  Bag.  Or something like that.  I don't know.  If she says saying  ching chong  to imitate a Chinese language  is as offensive  as the N word  is to black people, 
[01:12:30]  I don't know  what I'm going to do.  I'm going to pick up a...  I'm going to ring this bell.  And I'm going to...  Because I know  she's going to do it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Can we get some Asian people  on the air today?  I really need to know  why that's so offensive.  Travis,  get some on the horn, please.  Yeah.  They might not be awake.  Explain.  Although we wouldn't be able  to tell.  And I'm being serious.  Explain why ching chong  is so offensive  to you  if you're Asian.  Especially when it's done  in fun.  Like when you see  an Asian person,  sometimes you just  give their hair a little rustle 
[01:13:00]  and you go,  ching chong!  They love it.  They love it.  It's the only way  to imitate a language  you don't know  when you're trying  to convey some comedy  and you don't know  the language.  You don't research.  If you're a comedian  coming up with stuff  off the cuff,  you can't go to the library  and study Chinese  to accurately come up  with words  to use so as not  to offend somebody.  You have to make it  sound like Chinese.  What is the problem  with that  when it's done  in that context? 
[01:13:30]  It's not in a schoolyard  poking some Asian child  in the chest  and going ching ching.  People can't take things  in context anymore.  It's either  don't do it at all  or it's offensive  as anything.  Well, the Asians  were never known  in school.  She's going to say  that as kids in school  they got teased.  First of all,  get over it.  Everybody got teased.  Everybody.  Asians were never known  for being funny in school.  I'm sorry.  That's not your reputation.  No.  So stop talking  about what's happening  in school  because you were boring  in school. 
[01:14:00]  That's why you're  successful now.  Right.  You paid attention.  You do so well in math.  You paid attention  to the teacher  while we're all  goofing off  in the back of the room.  That's right.  I was shooting spitballs  and calling the teacher  Daddy-O.  Oh wait,  that's Charlie Brown.  Daddy-O.  Chuck Berryson.  My greatest thing  I used to do  at Harborfield High School  to entertain the students  because I was  so bored in class  I would reach  under the desk  and get some  of that really old  that real old gum.  You weren't this kid. 
[01:14:30]  I swear to God.  I was that kid.  Oh.  Maybe not the greatest  thing to admit  on a radio show  but I was the kid  that would pull off  the old gum  that was underneath  the desk.  Oh, good.  In some cases  it was there so long  that it was hard  as a rock.  That is disgusting.  And then as the teacher  is writing all that  crap on the board  I would get  the attention  of the class  and just throw it  in my mouth  and start chewing  and the whole class  would be like  oh!  And then the teacher  would turn around  and not know  what's going on.  You were a shock  student.  You were a shock  student. 
[01:15:00]  I was the  total class clown  but I modeled  myself after  John Wayne Gacy  so I would just  cut young boys  apart and rape them.  That type of clown, huh?  The class clown.  Yeah.  He's burying people  under his desk.  Let's get back  to those fun.  Want a painting?  Any Asian accent  to say ching chong  to someone  is very offensive  and some Asian people  have told me  it's as bad  as the N word.  No, it's not!  Oh my God! 
[01:15:30]  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  I did not hear that!  Oh no, stop it.  Some Asian people.  Which ones?  Who?  Who?  Who are these people?  Well, that's that  you're saying  his name now.  Who?  And by the N word  they meant Larry.  Oh my God!  As bad as the N word?  Someone's suggesting nip  because that was  a derogatory term  used during World War II. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  For nippon.  Mm-hmm.  Thank you.  I can think of  a million, million.  Ching chong  is as bad as the N word.  No.  How could she believe?  Why wouldn't you  spit in someone's face  for telling that?  Every culture now  is going to say  whatever this is  is as bad as the N word  and you're not going  to be able to say it,  do it,  use it,  write it.  Oh God, Rosie.  Rosie.  Oh, we were loving you too.  We were starting  to love you.  I guarantee you  the thing that bothered her...  For how edgy you've gotten  and how you were 
[01:16:30]  taking no bunk  from anybody.  And then you say that  and believe that?  She didn't like the fact  they compared the clay egg  and stuff to it.  I guarantee that's  what she didn't like.  The fact people said,  how could you be  so self-righteous?  Yeah, so now she's  going to have to come out  so she can,  in the future,  be outraged by things.  Oh, is that irritating?  Oh, let's continue.  I used to say  ching chong to someone  is very offensive  and some Asian people  have told me  it's as bad as the N word.  Which I was like,  really?  I didn't know that.  But to anyone  who felt offended  at my Chinese, Asian, 
[01:17:00]  pseudo-Japanese,  sounded a little Yiddish  accent that I was doing,  you know,  it was never intent  to mock anyone's...  Can I explain that  to the acupuncturus?  I'm sorry  for those people  who felt hurt  or were teased  on the playground.  Or were teased  on the playground?  How about this?  Ching chong is hilarious.  Right.  Deal with it.  What a bunch of babies.  You think Rosie O'Donnell  wasn't on the playground  being called fatty?  Or sir.  You just gave  John Liu  even more power. 
[01:17:30]  Oh my,  what a bunch  of babies.  We are really living  in a crappy-ass time.  We were teased  as children.  Just,  we are living  in an age  of just  oversensitive  crybabies.  How about this,  John Liu  and the rest of you  self-righteous  little babies?  Why don't you protest  the next Cornball  Jackie Chan film  which has him  not speaking  English properly?  There you go.  Why not that crap  which has passed  off as comedy? 
[01:18:00]  Jackie Chan  drawing a paycheck  completely  doing a stereotype.  Well,  we got a Chinese  guy on the line.  Dennis  from Jersey.  Dennis.  It's not Chinese.  Dennis,  stop it.  Dennis.  What's up, man?  Hey, Dennis.  Okay, you sound Asian.  Yeah, we can tell  by your voice.  You got that Asian accent.  I was born in New York, man.  Okay.  Yeah, but I can tell.  So what do you think  of this ching-chong crap?  You know,  back in the day  like when I was young  it bothered me  but now it's just like,  you know,  nothing, you know. 
[01:18:30]  See, people are confusing  things that happen  when they were young  with what happens  when you're an adult  and you grow up.  When you're young  things suck.  Children are very cruel.  You're in school  and you get picked on  for everything.  Everyone gets picked on  when they're younger.  Don't carry it over  because you were  sensitive to it  as a child  into your adult life  and make it  that same thing  that upset you  as a child  can't be used  in comedy anymore.  It draws apologies. 
[01:19:00]  There's a difference  between being teased  on the playground  and someone walking  up to you  on the street  with hate  on their mind  and singling you out  because of your race.  There is a huge difference.  The people are,  why should comedy  be held to that same stand?  It's so annoying.  Everyone knows  she was kidding  and wasn't trying  to be hurtful  and yet no one  takes it into account.  Everybody wants  to get to talk right  That's what's really  scary about this whole thing.  And what a groveling  fatso she is.  I really was enjoying her too.  Why would you apologize? 
[01:19:30]  The bosses behind the scenes  got to her.  That's why.  I apologize too.  That's why.  Hey, Dennis,  but you were called  Ching Chong growing up?  Well, yeah.  I mean,  I was like the only,  me and my brother  was like pretty much  the only Asian kid  in the school  and pretty much  in the whole freaking town.  So it was like  he would just come up  and do that fake  Chinese talk to you.  Yeah, I mean,  back in the day  it bothered me  but now it's just like,  you know,  it's nothing,  you know,  if anything,  you know,  it makes me stronger,  you know,  if anything.  But I mean,  is it like,  for her to say  it's as bad  as the N word, 
[01:20:00]  I mean,  hell no.  No, I know.  Slow down.  Slow down is right.  You know what?  I remember growing up  when I was in school,  one day,  I have a couple of instances,  I took a thermos  and you know  the glass-lined  plaid thermoses?  Sure.  And they used to have  glass inside of them?  Yeah,  they would shatter a lot.  Yeah,  they would break.  You would drop them  and go,  oh man.  That was like  one of those things  that was horrifying  as a kid.  If your thermos glass broke  and you didn't know  and maybe glass shards  would be in your juice 
[01:20:30]  or something like that.  But I picked one up  in the playground  and threw it against a tree  because I wanted to hear  what the glass sounded like.  It wasn't my thermos.  So I went into class  and the door opened up  and there was the principal,  she was this woman,  standing there  with this young  African-American child  and all he did,  I was up at the blackboard  working out a problem.  There wasn't a word spoken.  I turned my head  and she whispered  something to him  and all he did  was look at me 
[01:21:00]  and point his finger at me  and then was led off  and I got brought  into the office  and in trouble  for breaking that thermos.  Now that happened  when I was a kid  and I've since  never held anything  against black people.  Nah, the kids, you know.  How do you think he felt?  All right, Dennis.  Of course.  Gotta run the rinse cycle.  Remember to put in 
[01:21:30]  some softener.  Poor lad  trying to just have  his thermos full of Kool-Aid.  I'm assuming.  It was.  I don't even think  it was his thermos.  He was just ratting me out  for breaking the thermos.  Like he saw me  and ratted me out  and then another time  I was supposed to bring in  some type of food  from your ethnic background  which they would never do now  because it's too sensitive  and my mother just went out  and got some Italian cookie things  and they looked like 
[01:22:00]  lumps of waste products.  They really did.  And I brought him in  and all the kids would do  were making fun  of my Italian  and they called them  Italian-esque cookies.  And I remember  I just started crying  in school.  What finally happened?  The German kid  put them on his chest  and then ate them?  All right.  Listen, let's get back 
[01:22:30]  to the rest of Rosie here.  I guess this week yesterday.  I don't know.  And I'm sorry  for those people  who felt hurt  or were teased  on the playground  but I'm also  going to give you  a fair warning  that there's a good chance  I'll do something  like that again  probably in the next week  not on purpose  only because it's  how my brain works.  Do you know what I mean?  Oh, God.  Groveling worm.  Apologize.  Grovel.  And stupid Corolla.  I was out there in L.A.  I had to do something  for AVN. 
[01:23:00]  I had to have meetings  for the porn awards  and they're like  you want to do radio out here?  And I'm like  I don't know.  And they're like  we'll try to get you  on Adam Carolla  and I'm like  you won't be able  to get him on Carolla.  And they contacted  Carolla.  They didn't even  email them back.  So die.  And just keep apologizing.  Yeah, he had to apologize  because he did the same thing.  Good times.  Good times.  Ching Chong thing  and they were very upset  with it.  But you know  people really have to  start thinking about context.  People have thrown context  out the window.  Let me say out the window.  That's right. 
[01:23:30]  There is certain times  where things like that  are hateful.  And hurtful.  And damaging.  And other times  when it's humorous,  funny,  used in dark humor  or just comedy.  Take it for what it is.  When Rosie said that  do you honestly think  Rosie O'Donnell  was there trying to hurt  the Asian community?  No.  And that's why  they went after her  because they know  she was a soft  easy apology.  and an easy way  to get what they wanted. 
[01:24:00]  We reach a lot of people  in this John Lewis hiding.  Do you notice that he's hiding?  Give us a call.  We'll discuss this.  Why won't he?  We make a lot of Asian jokes.  How come he's not  complaining about this show?  He will eventually.  No, no.  Because he knows  he's not going to get an apology.  Yeah, he's not going to get  an apology.  It's not an easy target  because we fight back  and we're not just going  to buckle under.  Hey, we got one more call  as far as this goes.  Sean, he's black.  He's from Long Island.  Sean, what's up?  What up, ONA and Jim?  Hey, what's up, man? 
[01:24:30]  Let me tell you.  I'm going to comment  about the Rosie O'Donnell  N-word thing.  Chances are  you could go to Chinatown  and say ching chong  to a Chinese guy  and you may come out alive.  You go to the hood  and you say N-word  to a black dude.  Nah.  Nah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a big difference  between the two things.  Walk around with a sign  that says ching chong on it  in Chinatown.  Exactly.  And walk around  with an N-word sign  uptown  here in New York City 
[01:25:00]  and see  how many holes  you come out  of each part of town with  in your body.  If you yell ching chong  people will think  you rang their bell  and they'll open the front door.  So irritating.  Alright, well,  we got someone  that is Asian  and this offends them.  Eric in New Jersey.  Eric.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Eric?  How you doing?  Alright.  I just want to say  I've listened to your show  since 102.7  but that does offend me.  I'll be honest with you.  In what way, sir? 
[01:25:30]  Like,  if it's at a comedy club,  you're right.  It wouldn't offend me  because it's funny.  But Rosie's a comedian  and she's doing jokes  on a TV show.  Yeah.  Yeah, but  the whole creation thing too,  you know?  Hold on,  let me ask you a question,  Eric.  Margaret's show  has made her living  making fun of her mother's accent  being Asian  and her mother  not knowing the language.  That fan  got tremendous amount  of popularity  among Asians  making fun of the accent  and why are we doing that? 
[01:26:00]  So why  is that acceptable  under the context  or umbrella of humor?  Because they're making fun  of themselves.  No, I know that  but I'm asking him  why is he not?  That's so ridiculous  that logic.  Why doesn't that offend you?  Yeah.  Because you guys  aren't Asian.  You don't know.  Like, I go to a bar  and some guy says that  if, you know,  I want to rip his head off.  Okay, so hold on.  We're not Asian.  So you're saying that  there's a different set  of like what  it's acceptable  for some person  to say something in humor  but not acceptable  for someone else  to say something in humor.  Yeah, I mean, 
[01:26:30]  it's, I don't know.  Okay, different standards  for different.  Isn't that more racist  than actually doing a joke  about another race?  Isn't that more separatist  than just joking around  about another race?  You're like completely separating  saying that this is good  for this race  but not for this race.  I think it's rude in general.  Like, I mean,  I know you're allowed  to say what you want  but there's still things  that are rude in you.  So what I'm saying is  why isn't the Asian community,  this is what I'm talking about,  why aren't they angry  at Margaret Cho  who has been making 
[01:27:00]  the same corny accent jokes  for 15 years?  I don't know.  I have no clue.  I'm like the only Asian  that I've ever known  in my growing up  and I've never been  made fun of.  I was always like,  you know,  you know,  played sports and stuff.  I never got made fun of  as a kid.  Okay.  I'm just saying  as an adult  it actually offends me more  to be honest with you.  I just,  I understand what you're saying,  bro.  I just,  I don't know why people choose,  people choose to be offended  by stuff like this  because it's like  a sense of empowerment  and that's what bugs me  and if you think  that some people  should be able  to make fun of something  and not others, 
[01:27:30]  I mean,  come on,  man,  does that make any kind  of any sense to you  as long as it's done  in humor?  I'm not talking about  where it's done  to be hurtful  like Michael Richards  when he did  was really stupid  but if you're just  doing something to be funny  why should one person  be able to do it  not the other person?  Right.  I mean,  I've been at comedy shows  I heard like  that Lisa Chicks  make fun of you.  I mean,  it's funny.  You're right.  I mean,  but that's like  the only time though.  I mean,  you guys are separating  like 1% and 99%.  But,  but the 1% is important  if it's humor  and it's not just 1%  that's being attacked  in political correctness.  It's not the 1%.  They're not attacking  you know, 
[01:28:00]  they're attacking  a lot more than that.  You found the Rosie  thing offensive?  What?  You found the Rosie  O'Donnell thing offensive?  I didn't hear it  so I don't know.  Oh.  Nah,  it was so innocent.  I probably wouldn't have.  It was really innocent.  And especially Rosie  who's very liberal  who doesn't trash people  based on race or gender.  That's just not her thing.  Yeah.  All right,  Eric.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  We're just going to have  to agree to disagree.  Well,  I don't want to get  that harsh, Ant.  Steven from Bayshore,  can you guys play  a gong sound  at the end  of all Asian phone calls? 
[01:28:30]  We can start that, yes.  The gong.  Hey,  we got to take  a quick break.  Lots going on.  Homeless shopping sprees  tomorrow.  We're all excited  about that.

[01:35:30]  That's right  How?  I don't know  I have no idea  I have no idea  Let's explain how it's different  Well I know Miss Universe is different  Because they bring in aliens  From other galaxies  Because if it's Miss Universe  How could we just have Earth in that?  It's a little pompous  But they never make the finals  The aliens  No  They're too scary to look at  No  They knock them out on the preliminaries  So you don't get to see them on TV  Yeah because who's gonna want to see  Like a big hiney headed creature  Right  Like that  George Lucas  He's put in another  Faggity cantina scene  Yuck 
[01:36:00]  Pompous Miss Universe  I wish a UFO would fly here  And go  We have our entry  And if she doesn't win  We're gonna kill you all  They bring in their entry  And it's just  It's a woman  She has no larynx  And six vaginas  And you're like  My god  He's the winner  Give her the sash  And a box of breasts  That she just hands out to people  Have one  Have one  Have one  Have one  Just a blob rolls out onto the stage  In a bikini  Just a blob  From the planet whore 
[01:36:30]  Actually I think  Miss USA  Yeah  A little sluttier  Yeah  They let them get a little sluttier  Well apparently not too much more  Well this is Miss America though  Is it?  You asked me the difference  I thought this is Miss USA  They're talking about  Oh  Miss America  What?  Miss America had always been held up  To these very fine standards  Don't eat in public  A little weird things  It was like really  Miss USA  They seem to loosen up  A little more  But 
[01:37:00]  Now this girl's in trouble  Because she's out  Perusing some bars  But she's only 20  Miss America  They're very strict  With Miss USA  They kind of draw the line  Of Bukkake videos  Right  Like after three  You have to stop  Or we take your  Then enough  They want you to try new things  Because you're young  And you know  But that's excessive  I had the confusion  Because it was labeled Miss America  So it's Miss USA  Miss USA  Miss USA is a little sluttier though  Yeah  Her name is Tara Conner  Tara Conner 
[01:37:30]  I'm looking for Tara Conner  Tara  She is a purdy purdy though  Nice arms on her  I think I watched this  Did you?  Yeah  She looks like a stripper man  Yeah  And she's 20  So you know  She's all full of the party spirit  So um  Yeah  What are you going to do?  An ugly mark  From Miss USA  Ugly mark  Donald not happy about it  The website  TMZ.com  Says Tara Conner  Has been hitting the bar scene  Having lots of drinks 
[01:38:00]  Even though she's not 21  Organizers of the pageant  Say they're looking  Into her behavior  Pageant owner  Donald Trump  Will make an announcement  Next week  About whether  They're stripping  Conner  Of her tea era  Stripping  Get it  Stripping  So she goes out  To the bars  She likes to  Tip a few back  And she's only 20  So what  Who cares  What's going to happen  When she turns 21  Exactly  Big metamorphosis  That's good publicity  For the Miss USA pageant  Yeah  She's a goer 
[01:38:30]  She's a goer  People want to know  That they're goers  Deep down  Right  Yeah  Alright  It's time for  Macbook karaoke  Oh boy  You got a lot  To live up to  People  Uh  Well  We got the  Yeah the Macbook  We've been giving away  All week  The karaoke's been terrific  Of course  The famous one  I saw the sign  And it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  Life is demanding  Without understanding

[01:39:30]  Which one should we go to first?  She's actually out of breath  Because she's blowing into the tube  On her wheelchair  To move around  Jesus Pamela  I saw the sign  Sign  Moves forward four feet  And by the way  I wish the radio listeners  Could see Sam's sweatshirt  It's white and baggy  Like a girl in 1986 would wear  Yeah  And it has little baby pins  All over it  Look  They're safety pins  I have been waiting  About a month  For him to wear this  To work

That's not the hottest  According to eBay  Now what is that modeled after?  Who wears that?  Well I first saw it  Because Jay-Z was pictured  In the New York Times  Wearing it  And I said  That's nice  Yeah  I'd like to have one too  Yeah  And so I had to go find it  I wasn't bragging about it  It was other staff members  Who brought it to your attention  That I had purchased it  Yes  Other staff members 
[01:40:30]  Of course  Brought it to my attention  But what do the  Safety pins mean?  Yo dude  They don't have to mean nothing  Does it mean something?  It's just  It's just cool  That switch  Why is it cool though?  Stinks  Why is it cool?  Why are safety pins  Like I can  I can understand  That you know  Years ago  Punk  And they  Put the safety pins  Through their shirts  And pants  And stuff  But I don't understand  Just the print of  Of little safety pins

[01:52:00]  How could that happen  We're plum out  Wow  Yeah there's a song  That someone sent in  It's called  Santa  Santa's in a wheelchair  Alright  Santa's in a wheelchair  We haven't played many holiday tunes yet this year  Let's check this one out  Santa's in a wheelchair  Santa's in a wheelchair 
[01:52:30]  Santa's in a wheelchair  Santa's in a wheelchair  Santa  Can you sing  Feliz Aida  Santa's in a wheelchair  Please ring your bell  Worst nightmare, you in the crib. 
[01:53:00]  Oh. 
[01:53:30]  I like their first album better.  Sophomore jinx on these tards.  Yep.  Their first album, you know.  I think they were more retarded on their first album.  First, the second album, Santa's in a wheelchair, not as good as the first one.  Dad's in the church cursing God. 
[01:54:00]  I think success went to their fat heads.  Success went to his tongue.  Man, you've changed a lot since you got famous, man.  Lifting the toilet seat and everything.  Yeah, that sucked.  Santa's in a wheelchair.  Yeah, they kind of ran out of material.  Exactly.  What is he saying?  That, like, Santa's also a handy-capable? 
[01:54:30]  Right.  Handy-capable.  Very good.  And Santa's in the wheelchair.  And, uh, tragic, watching him try to roll out of the fireplace.  His dad lights a fire.  He lands on your roof and he just slides sideways into the gutter and he freezes to death on  your roof.  Stupid, spineless Santa Claus.  Just injured, but he was drunk driving in Long Island.  I like that flip side.  Rudolph has spina bifida.  Rudolph the red-tongued reindeer. 
[01:55:00]  Gray wolf.  That was the kids of, what, Whitney High?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were trying to get another hit on their hands.  How long have they been in high school?  Jesus Christ, these kids.  41.  Yeah, he's 41 years old.  Father-son graduating team.  Hey, can we try to get Matt Noyes on the air before we get out of here?  I'd love to.  Let's give him another call.  He's, uh, he's trying to cause trouble up there in Boston as far as our homeless shopping 
[01:55:30]  spree goes.  Doesn't like our homeless shopping spree.  Doesn't like the fact that we're going to be giving some of the homeless people, uh,  some booze on the trip over, uh, you know, loosen them up, let them have some fun.  It's Saturday.  They're going to be shopping.  We're going to be giving them money and clothes and going to be a lot of listeners treating  them like rock stars.  And, uh, these are guys that like their beers.  They like drinking a little.  So what's wrong with tipping a few back when you're ready to party and do some holiday shopping?  Uh, we all do it.  So, uh, uh, this guy's got a problem with it.  He doesn't like the fact that we're exploiting, he says, the homeless, degrading them, uh, 
[01:56:00]  giving them alcohol.  He's from the AIDS housing corporation.  Yeah.  And there's an article in the Boston Globe today about our homeless shopping spree.  AIDS housing.  Is that when you buy a house and then, uh, it just gets smaller and smaller every day  you live in it until you're in a closet?  The mailbox is like the most prominent part.  I'm going to say it has the widest back door in the neighborhood. 
[01:56:30]  The front door is spat upon and ignored.  Well, we're trying to get him on the air.  You know, he, he started an email blast.  They're getting everyone to call BCN today to tell him not to air our homeless shopping  spree tomorrow when we do it, uh, two to 6 p.m. in the afternoon.  Sheet rocks so thin you could see the two by fours right through them.  When the maid tries to take the plunger out of the toilet, she's fired. 
[01:57:00]  Hot tub is filled with broth.  Now, see, this is the stuff he should be mad at.  That's right.  AIDS housing.  AIDS has no place to live.  All right, don't forget, Short Hills Mall tomorrow.  Just behave if you go to the mall to watch the homeless shop.  Have fun with it.  The fun will make itself.  Yeah. 
[01:57:30]  You'll just show up.  Hey, uh, yeah, we'll try to get him on the air after the break.  Matt Noyes, or I don't know how to pronounce his last name.  N-O-Y-E-S, okay?  Travis, have you called him a few times?  Yeah, let's try him again.  Hey, as we go to break, in honor of the homeless shopping spree tomorrow,  let's play that Gray Wolf song again.  A lot of people loving that thing.  That would have been a hit.  Gray Wolf, one of our homeless friends, he came in and off the cuff just started singing about  Tippi Tom and, uh.  Being homeless.  Being homeless, and we took, uh, what he sang off the cuff and we made it into a song. 
[01:58:00]  Drew Boogie.  Well, Drew Boogie gets all the credit, absolutely.  Uh, this is called Shelter Me from Gray Wolf.  Let's see how this comes out.  Can I have a paper towels?  All right.  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I gotta go break.  Ah, this is nice.  Oh, you're a wolf.  This is a story about a man, and he always was so lonely at night, but his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station, and I'm gonna sing this one. 
[01:58:30]  This is about Tippi told Tommy.  Let's go while we're young.  Oh, you're a wolf. 
[01:59:00]  That ain't you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have homes.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain. 
[01:59:30]  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have homes.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Just a little piece.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:00:00]  Coming tomorrow, December 16th from 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The crew from the O.P. and Anthony Show is leaving New York City tomorrow at 2 p.m. and bringing a bus full of homeless degenerates to the Short Hills Mall in Short Hills, New Jersey.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit  as we partake in another homeless shopping spree tomorrow, December 16th, at the Short Hills Mall. 
[02:00:30]  Bye!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jimmy has something to say from the Bronx real fast.  Jimmy, what's up?  Listen, guys, when I first started hearing that song, I thought it was like a put-on.  I didn't realize that was a real bum singing that song.  That thing had me... I was almost crying listening to that.  It was? Wait, with the Grey Wolf song?  People love Shelter Me by Grey Wolf. They love it.  The guy, by the way, has cleaned up a little bit.  He's not as homeless anymore. 
[02:01:00]  Well, let me tell you something.  That song will do more for homeless people and people, you know, wanted to help them  than anything else out there.  And don't let anybody knock you and tell you to stop doing your homeless shopping spree  and all of that stuff.  That song is intense.  I'm telling you, it's unbelievable.  You know what sucks?  He did it off the cuff.  We tried to get another verse out of the guy, and then we took the whole thing,  and Drew Boogie actually brought him to his studio.  We were convinced we had a hit song on our hands. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, it's great.  I think you do.  Well, we tried everything.  We got him into a studio, and he couldn't capture what he did live on our show that day.  I still think that there's a way to do it again.  And there's a way with – look, if they can make Paris Hilton somehow sound like a human  being is singing, they can take him into a studio, give him the lyrics, and how about  somebody help him write something?  You don't have to leave it for him to write it.  His voice is so powerful.  It's just unbelievable the way –  It's like gravel, yeah.  That gravelly voice. 
[02:02:00]  Somebody else could write something, and they could mix that into the version that's  already there and make it, like, use that as the chorus and get a couple more verses.  It's very possible.  We only need one more verse.  That's all we need.  And then loop the shelter, you know, and then you got a hit on your hand.  Where's Drew Boogie?  It was beautiful.  Really beautiful.  Is Drew still around?  I mean, Drew, we should try that again, man.  I think Drew can do that very well.  Yeah, we should.  We should try it again.  We rested it for about six to eight months.  Maybe we should try again.  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All right, guys.  See you, man.  All right.  Let's say how to dug out Doug. 
[02:02:30]  Doug, what's going on today?  What's up, guys?  I know we're trying to bully these stations into carrying the show on Saturday, but if  they don't carry the show live on Saturday, I know there's a couple guys from FBA going  with their Pallet Talk cameras and laptops.  They're going to go past it, and we're going to try to hit it up in the Pallet Talk rooms  to get it out there for everybody.  Wait, Doug, you guys are reaching out to the stations?  I'm sorry?  You guys are reaching out to the stations?  You're reaching out to the stations trying to get them?  Yeah, we're trying to get some emails out to the stations to try to get them to carry 
[02:03:00]  it, but I know I haven't gotten any responses back.  At this point, I think it's too late.  It's going to be live in New York, Philly, and Boston, and that is it, unfortunately,  which just amazes me.  The rest of the stations will run the rebroadcast on Monday when they usually run the Opie and  Anthony show.  I'm sure that there's rock blocks to play.  Yeah, but we will be here live in New York tomorrow from 2 to 6 p.m., giving you the  play-by-play of the Homeless Shopping Spree, which is happening at Short Hills Mall.  You go there.  All we ask is you behave and watch the homeless shop, and we'll do the play-by-play at 2 to 
[02:03:30]  6 p.m.  Right.  Short Hills Mall, yes.  Okay.  And, Doug, you guys are going, like you said, with the Pallet Talk cameras, so you'll get  a nice different angle if you're watching on Pallet Talk.  Yeah, we got a guy that's on FBA that's going to be doing play-by-play, and we do rundowns  for the show, so he's going to be doing by-the-minute rundowns for everybody, too.  All right, cool.  I expect a few thousand people at that mall tomorrow.  I think it's going to be the biggest turnout yet.  You got more people this year listening than you did last year.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, and last year, I think we pushed close to 1,000 people. 
[02:04:00]  It's going to be big, and the weather's supposed to really be very good, nice and warm,  unseasonably warm, clear.  That's what I'm going to say.  I mean, I hope so.  Oh, I hope so.  I hope it's not damp.  I don't want anybody to catch their death.  All right, Doug.  Thanks for everything you do.  Bye, boys.  OAExperience.com.  Bye, cutie.  All right.  We can wrap up with a couple news teases.  We started this the other day.  We ran out of time.  Oh, yeah.  My brother's here.  Brother Elmo, you do the football picks yet?  No, let's do them.  All right.  What do you got this week? 
[02:04:30]  Well, first of all, all three of the New York teams, including the two that actually play  in New Jersey, are going to win this week.  Ooh.  Yes, the Bills are going to squish the fish.  Jets are going to be over the Vikings.  And Big Blue is going to take down the bird.  He doesn't say, I think, or this, or that.  He just, he goes, this is what's going to happen.  This will happen.  He's like the sports guys that just go, let me tell you what's going to happen.  He does fantasy football.  He knows what he's talking about.  Oh, really?  Who's the bird?  Hey, I'm not in a playoff, so I didn't do too well.  Huh?  Who's the bird?  Philadelphia, the Eagles.  Okay. 
[02:05:00]  Lindsay, no.  The bird, the fish.  I didn't know who it was the Ravens.  Squish the fish.  Oh, well.  Could have been the Ravens.  It could have been, who knows?  I did well last week, four for five.  So if I have another big week, I could be in the running for this $10,000.  And by the way, if I do win the $10,000, yes, from a helicopter, throwing it out to the  people below.  It could make a little bit of a ruckus.  Well.  Okay.  Good defense.  Well, what else can I say? 
[02:05:30]  All right, go ahead.  And we have two more here.  The steel curtain's going to come down on the Panthers, definitely.  Ugh.  And if you want to lock.  Jimmy's looking at you like, ugh.  No, I kind of like the fact that he's taking the most awful way of saying it and doing that.  I'm doing my hack radio bit.  I like the steel curtain.  Thank you very much.  Wait, the steel curtain's coming down on what?  On the Panther.  All right.  Ah.  If anybody...  Someone know a vet?  I know. 
[02:06:00]  That steel curtain could damage his little back.  Bah!  Wouldn't it be the Panthers, though?  There's more than one playing, no?  No, you got to be cool.  It's like when you say the Rangers in hockey, you say the range.  Ugh.  The range.  Who are the Giants playing?  Big Blue, you mean?  Who are they playing?  Big Blue.  Big Blue, you idiot.  Big Blue.  Jimmy, stop.  They're all going to bake a bird this week.  Oh, the Eagles.  I don't like the way you're phrasing the Big Blue.  Wow.  They're going to clip the wings of the bird.  All right.  Big Blue.  Big Blue. 
[02:06:30]  Now, anybody listening, if you want an absolute lock, an absolute lock, the Ram is going to  crush the raid.  It's over.  Steve Jack, Steven Jackson, is going to run rampant on the freaking Raiders.  It's over, Johnny.  Oh, wait.  I don't like the Big Blue name.  Oh, they've been Big Blue forever.  No, they haven't.  Oh, yeah, they have.  No, I don't buy it.  You're going to piss off a lot of people out there.  They've been Big Blue forever.  Exactly.  Big Blue.  How about this?  I predict that the Down Syndrome tongues are going to defeat the Eagles out of Pennsylvania. 
[02:07:00]  That's the way I say it.  You done over there?  That's it.  All right.  Thank God he's done.  I was going to see the Nort was going to punch the Moe in about two more seconds.  The Nort was going to punch the Moe?  El Moe.  Yeah.  See?  El Moe.  Norton.  Oh, I actually didn't get it.  I thought you were saying the Moe.  Why would I hit Steve?  Today's football pick sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all. 
[02:07:30]  Call 1-888-GET-DISHED.  We'll see how El Moe did with his picks on Monday.  All right.  Are you promoting anything today?  Just MySpace slash Brother El Moe.  Jesus.  And he's going to help us out with the homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  All right.  Do we have time to get a couple more news teases in before we get out of here?  Yes, I am promoting something, too.  Oh, what?  Oh, oh.  New Year's Eve at the Borgata Casino.  Yeah.  Can't wait.  People say it's hard to get tickets.  Just go to Borgata.com.  BorgataCasino.com. 
[02:08:00]  I'm not going.  Why?  I'm so there.  You were supposed to be there.  Well, now I'm not.  Why?  Because I don't feel good.  You got your room and everything.  I know.  I don't know who's opening yet.  I got to get openers real quick.  That could be awkward.  I know.  Have Pat opened by doing the baby bird for everybody.  Yeah.  I'm not following that.  Actually, we could do that just before New Year's.  In my suit.  Dude, you finish your set and we have him come out and reenact the baby bird.  What?  The countdown?  New Year's Eve.  Right on zero.  He pukes.  Oh, my God. 
[02:08:30]  The dropping of the vomit.  Yeah, I'm sure that the Borgata.  Yeah, they would love that class act.  Eh, whatever.  In what is, they call the best, you know, hotel casino in Atlantic City these days.  Pretty much the benchmark of what they want Atlantic City to be like.  Nice vomit act.  All right.  Hey, let's get a scary news tease in before we get out of here.  Here's the latest scary news tease.  Human bones, human flesh, some infected with disease, transplanted into unknowing patients 
[02:09:00]  in Northeast Ohio.  No one knows whether his bodies were healthy, whether they were affected by infectious diseases  and hepatitis C and AIDS.  A chilling I-Team investigation tonight on Fox 8 News at 10.  And then happy music starts.  Around the corner.  A dead body.  I don't know if that qualifies, only because it is kind of letting you know.  It is what it is.  Yeah, I really only kept it in there simply because of the production value. 
[02:09:30]  Like, it was all sensationalized.  Even though they kind of get to the point it was still over.  I'll accept that, Danny, because, yeah, some of these news teases are kind of mutating  into dramatic movie trailers for stories.  They're adding the same production values that they do for movie trailers.  The music, the thump, thump, thump, dah, you know, the shocking moment, the build.  Oh, bless you, E-Rock.  Oh, my God, he sneezes like a girl.  Sneezes like a girl, too.  It's the same way he makes love.  Did you hear that? 
[02:10:00]  Like a girl.  I was expecting a little, ha-choo, ha-choo, ha-choo.  What's the matter, sweetie?  Aw, E-Rock's got a cold.  Aw, you have a little cold, you hope?  Like a little bronchitis or something?  All right, let's get a little asthma.  I'll give you asthma.  Do you have a little inhaler like the little kid on Goonies?  You dress like him.  E-Rock, did you catch a cold while you were face down and someone was, quote, unquote, 
[02:10:30]  taking your temperature?  Poor sweet boy.  Normal again, but we'll have to check on the hour.  That's right.  Now put this under your tongue.  But I don't want...  But now it smells funny.  Here's another scary news tease.  Plus, it's all the talk.  And your cell phone caused brain cancer?  A new study has the answer.  You'll get it in House Call.  How about yes or no?  Yeah, how about a...  Is that Ernie Anastas? 
[02:11:00]  What a stupid-ass Ernie Anastas is.  Reports the Hindenburg is down in Lakehurst.  How old is the cell phone story?  Can we get an answer?  You're right.  There's no answer to this.  Some people...  Oh, no.  No damage at all.  Other people have brain tumor.  They said they had the latest thing on it, though.  The latest thing?  The latest thing.  The latest study?  The latest study.  What is the latest study?  Yes or no?  Well, the latest study says that you cannot get brain cancer from cell phones.  No?  Thank God.  Really?  Good.  Know why I say thank God? 
[02:11:30]  Because if a lousy, tiny little cell phone could cause brain cancer, we are effed as radio  show hosts.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that is pretty bad.  We are just effed.  I'd hate to get a little lump in my head.  No.  Everything causes cancer.  But now everyone's going to get fingertip cancer from texting.  No one really...  How long do you stay on the phone anymore?  Quick texts.  Yes, I'll be there.  No.  You're a tool.  And Danny, go eff yourself at all hours. 
[02:12:00]  And finally, here it is.  The last scary news tease.  A cat stuck in this tree.  Will she be rescued at 11?  Okay, it's a joke.  Some woman with a nice news voice.  You got her in the studio.  Found some good music that sounded like the news.  And are trying to pull the wool over our eyes because that can't be a news tease.  A cat stuck in this tree. 
[02:12:30]  Will she be rescued at 11?  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Is it?  Without understanding.  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.  It's all the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong.  But where do you belong?  Shoulder roll.  And the breathing heavy. 
[02:13:00]  If the off, bare shoulders, backward roll.  Right.  She sings the same way Karen would sing to Henry Hill as he was getting busted.  That's it.  All right, we're going to...  I told him, don't do that when I saw the sign.  I saw the signs, Henry.  They were going to find the signs.  I needed those signs.  That's all we had, Karen.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign. 
[02:13:30]  And then he pushed me out of the car.  I hit my head on the sign.  I saw the sign.  All right, listen.  Yeah.  Who gives a crap about the cat?  I have to know what happened, Hopi.  A cat stuck in this tree.  Will she be rescued at 11?  At 11.  Fox 5.  There's a wacky news guy.  Look at the news guys dancing.  What are they doing?  There's Mike.  There's our buddy Mike.  He's dancing. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, my God.  He's dancing.  Mike Woods is dancing.  We better have audio of that.  They found a website where there's a dancing elf or something.  A dancing elf.  But they won't stop.  You're going to do it all day.  Look at Mike's head shaking.  I tell you, it's in their blood.  They just dance well.  Police tell me they couldn't rescue the cat.  Yeah.  I don't mean to be racist.  No.  I'm going to say all ching chongs.  Right.  They just dance goodly.  We all know.  We knew what you meant. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  What's up with the cat?  Yeah.  What happened?  I wish it ended horrifically.  They left it up there and she died.  Yeah.  I'm sure that's what happened.  Cool.  I hope a boy fired like an arrow into its cat stomach.  And little almost born kittens fell out of the tree.  And a man with boots stepped on them.  And then everybody laughed.  That's how that story ended.  Little kittens with little kitten slime on them.  Begging for a kiss and some love.  Stepped on by the boots of a big man.  A burly fellow with hairy buttocks. 
[02:15:00]  Crushing the little animals as children who are sick and cancerous cried.  That's how that story should have ended.  And her children cried.  Here's the big plug because we've got to get out of here.  Homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  Yes, we are working.  We will be live tomorrow.  On Saturday.  On Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m.  Giving the play-by-play.  You, as a fan, if you feel like it, you can go to the Short Hills Mall.

The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Hi.  We have a crowd out here this morning. 
[02:17:30]  Everyone say hi.  Oh.  They're here to get sent to the homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  Yeah.  It's going to be very interesting tomorrow at Short Hills Mall.  A mad house.  We got a couple from Tampa, right?  Came up from Tampa.  I'd say a little bit of Corey Kelvin.  West Virginia over here.  West Virginia.  New Orleans.  You guys came up just for us or?  Orlando.  Orlando. 
[02:18:00]  And then we got this guy's birthday.  What's your name, bro?  My name's Mike Weil.  And it's your birthday today?  Today is my birthday.  From Massachusetts.  40.  The big 4-0.  All right.  So you're from New Orleans?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm from New Orleans.  You guys had your own homeless shopping spree.  Yeah, we did.  From Katrina.  They just wanted to touch.  They just wanted to touch it.  They just wanted to touch.  Let them touch.  Kayaks for everyone.  Nothing?  All right.  Well, we got Pat from Minaki here. 
[02:18:30]  Pat.  How did you get here so quickly?  What's up, Pat?  What's going on?  Pat, how'd you get here so quickly?  I was just watching you in your trailer.  My Svelte van.  My unofficial wow van.  You look younger with hair, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  You look younger.  Oh.  I saw...  It looks like cotton candy, but, you know.  He has pecking pats of blonde.  Sugarless.  He's a blonde.  What was that one, sir?  It's more moist than Kenny's.  I just want... 
[02:19:00]  Oh, I didn't even hear that.  I thought he said something with candy.  I didn't realize...  It was a bomb, so I'm like,  let everyone hear this and relish this one.  I didn't realize you wanted something with candy.  But it's actually funny and relevant.  Now it's uncomfortable.  Kenny thinks I set him up, which I didn't.  I would never make fun of you like that in front of me.  No.  No, never.  So, Pat, I saw you decorated the trailer.  Yeah, I put up a string of lights.  You put up a string of lights, what, by your door, was that?  No, inside the door.  It didn't look very even.  Yeah, well, I just put it up willy-nilly, as I like to call it. 
[02:19:30]  Willy-nilly.  Willy-nilly.  If that isn't a fire hazard in that fucking trailer of yours...  Wait till the tree comes in this week and...  You put a Christmas tree in?  I'm gonna now.  Yeah.  Wow.  How's your girlfriend?  Oh, she's wonderful.  Where is she?  Is she more a girlfriend since the last time we talked to you?  No, we're still just friends.  I saw her laying on your bed.  Yeah.  That was a little...  Now, people would believe that that would mean it's a little more than it was.  Nah.  How are you doing? 
[02:20:00]  Good.  How are you?  Good.  How is Pat's bed?  I saw you on Pal Talk laying down on it.  It's comfy?  Yeah.  Does Pat ever join you in there in any way, shape, or form?  No.  No, he sleeps on the couch.  I mean, not sleeping, but just kind of, you know, talking or relaxing, something like  that.  No.  He never even makes a move like that.  No.  Has it ever been really called out and Pat said, look, I'd hate to have to put you outside,  but...  We have the animals that keep us warm.  I cuddle with Joey, my golden lab. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  The animals are so happy to finally see a human show up.  Even a jar of peanut butter, I'm just fine.  Have you found any broken off female fingernails in the walls or anything?  On the floor?  No.  Going toward the door?  They suddenly stop?  No, the next girl will.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Pat from Wynaki, the star of the Baby Bird video, by the way.  And, of course, half a Hulk face has shown up.  Yeah, another familiar...  Oh, what a sweet he is.  Familiar face, you can call it that. 
[02:21:00]  Another horrific face.  How you doing?  Familiar face.  I'm all right.  How you guys doing?  Your hair looks like shit.  Huh?  Your hair's all messed up.  I know.  Yeah.  I need a haircut.  You got bed hair.  Yep.  Face.  I haven't been to bed yet, actually.  But you're dressed very nicely.  Where'd you get the duds?  Gotta work your clothes.  You have me now and then, you know?  That's pretty good.  You look clean and nice.  Oh.  I try.  People didn't forget they're holding on money for their photo op with half a Hulk face. 
[02:21:30]  That's why he washed his hair and got it all nice with a photo op today.  All right.  Line up if you want a photo op with half a Hulk face.  Yeah.  Line up.  Five bucks.  Five bucks, you chiselers.  Five dollars.  Five dollars.  Hand them five.  Wait.  I forgot the price.  Danny, how much?  Five dollars.  Five dollars.  Five dollars.  Five dollars.  All right.  Here we go.  We're getting photo ops right now.  Nice.  Half a Hulk face.  That's why people came out.  Yes.  I was wondering why the big crowd today.  That's good.  And pay half a Hulk face. 
[02:22:00]  Pay him five dollarinis.  There you go.  Five dollars for a photo op.  Make sure you get the good side of his face there.  Half a Hulk face.  That's right.  Wait.  No, you got it.  Hold on, E-Rock.  E-Rock, you stink.  See, if the guy is going to get a picture with half a Hulk face, why wouldn't you be over  there so he can see the bad side?  Why wouldn't you take a picture of that side?  The bad side.  You don't want the good side.  You want the Hulk side.  Oh, God.  He's taking the David Banner side.  That's right.  All right.  Very nice.  There you go. 
[02:22:30]  Who else wants a photo op for five bucks?  Oh, it's not bucks.  It's dollars.  Dollars.  Dollars.  A mere five dollars.  It's nothing.  Pat from Menaki doesn't have much money, but he wants his picture taken with half a Hulk  face.  Other side.  Other side.  Other side.  Dummy.  All right.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  And he puts up the other finger.  Look at him.  I'll pay.  I'll pay for four pictures.  Wow.  Who wants a picture with half a Hulk face?  Here you go.  There's four pictures. 
[02:23:00]  Will he win the lottery?  There we go.  All right.  All right.  People get in their pictures taken with half a Hulk face.  With Pat from Menaki.  Just got his pictures.  A guy who was obviously.  Anyone else?  There you go.  A guy who's obviously the Tyson Lennox Lewis bout.  This kid can take a punch, I tell you.  Jesus.  Could you smile at least half a Hulk face?  Are you smiling?  Is that a smile?  Let that guy get his picture taken on Opie.  He's here every day.  What? 
[02:23:30]  Which guy?  This guy.  You get a free picture on Opie.  Okay.  All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  Well, how about you wait for the other guy to take it?  Yeah.  Let the other side.  Get on the other side.  All right.  People getting their pictures taken with half a Hulk face.  There you go.  How about this dude who looks kind of like he could be related to half a Hulk face if  that thing didn't happen?  Get him on the other side.  He's here every day, too.  Get him.  Get your shot with half a Hulk face.  Looks like he's a construction worker that comes out every day instead of working.  Very good.  Why would you assault him like that? 
[02:24:00]  I know.  Why not the other side where you could lick the tumor?  Anyone else want their picture taken with half a Hulk face?  It's only $5.  For the price of a gourmet cup of coffee.  That's right.  That's it?  I paid for four pictures.  No?  No one else?  All right.  That's it.  Hey, shaky cam.  Someone's digging into their wallet.  $5.  There it is.  Very good.  $5.  All right.  Look at this kid.  Hey, half a Hulk face making up pretty good today.  Oh, sir.  He's making a pretty penny.  This makes a great MySpace picture. 
[02:24:30]  Yes, it does.  Christmas cards, too.  Christmas cards, if you want to.  Damn it.  And, of course, he hands out.  Wait, what is this?  What do you got?  Wait, what is this?  Talk about potting, banging chicks, and getting hand jobs.  All right.  Fighting the fight.  Nape fight.  Love you guys.  All right.  White supremacy and things like that.  Wait, that was the worst plug ever.  What is this?  Great band from Jersey City, making the scene in the whole world, YouTube and all the other  shit.  But it's too racy for regular radio. 
[02:25:00]  Too racy?  So we figured we...  Well, watch your language there.  That's what the kids are saying.  It's saying racy.  This is satellite, my friend.  So we brought it down, because it's a lot of curses and a lot of fun.  As soon as we get to XM, we're going to play some of these tunes.  Yeah, I think you'll like it.  Are you saying it's a little...  Oh, rice.  The language is salty?  It is.  So it's blue.  It's definitely blue.  A little salty.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  A little photo op with half a Hulk face.  Everybody enjoyed.  That was good.  Oh, look at this German officer.  Wow.  Doesn't he look like a young Nazi?  Yeah, he looks like a...  Strapping young German. 
[02:25:30]  He's a captain in the German army.  Right.  Just mulling over which one of the family he wants to shoot.  Just following orders.  Uh-oh.  Someone took Andrew's spot.  Oh, who is this guy?  I don't know, but...  Oh, and he's got a cat.  I hate these fucking homeless guys that use animals like this.  What else is the animal doing?  You know...  I'll give money for the cat.  Hey, Sam Jackson.  Oh, this guy's hungry.  Wow, this guy...  I bet he's no fun.  Oh, he's probably not.  Hey, what's your cat's name, sir?  That's Blackie? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  That's all right.  That was the cat answering.  I had two cats.  Sylvester died.  He went behind the building and died.  Sylvester died?  Wow, the cat eats well.  He's pretty fat.  Well, he's been living right here for like 10 years.  Yeah?  How long have you been in this spot?  Since 1998.  Wow.  Good stuff for a little.  Good stuff for a little.  Blackie was a baby.  And what's your name, sir?  My name is Catman.  Catman?  Well, what's your cat?  All right.  That makes sense.  Just like Scatman.  It'd be silly if it was Dogman. 
[02:26:30]  But my name is Robert.  Robert.  Yeah.  But they call you Catman.  Uh-huh.  And you're in this area here, huh?  You hang out?  I'm here all the time.  Sometimes I'm on Fifth Avenue in front of the Presbyterian Church.  You know Andrew?  He's a guy, Indian guy.  He talks like this.  Hello, how are you?  I am Andrew.  God bless you.  And he puts out the pennies there.  He's usually here.  Would you kick his ass out?  Well, he sits here because I don't come over here in the morning.  I go over to the Presbyterian Church.  But usually I'm the only person to sit here.  Really? 
[02:27:00]  This is your spot, right?  Are you guys territorial about your spots?  I used to have a cardboard box.  I lived it right here.  I was like a cardboard box guy.  We've knocked on that cardboard box.  Yeah, we knocked on trying to wake you up.  I don't know who you guys was.  We wanted to say hi.  We wanted to say hi.  We couldn't find the doorbell.  Sorry.  It happens.  Hey, does the cat get you better tips or whatever?  Better donations?  Well, we're both homeless, so we just better get money to survive.  That's all I mean.  Yeah, I hear you.  Yeah.  Is he cold?  Is he cold?  No, I got a sweater, but he don't want it on there. 
[02:27:30]  He's got a coat.  Jimmy?  Look at him.  The cat has a sweater.  He has a sweater right here.  Oh.  But something about this fall weather, he doesn't want to wear it.  Yeah, it's not that cold out.  He doesn't like the color.  He wants to lick his fur.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, who doesn't?  All right, Catman, everyone.  All right, Catman.  If you got some change, give Catman some money.  All right.  Of Catman and his cat.  Thank you.  There you go, man.  Home with shopping spree tomorrow.  Is Catman going to join us or what?  He's not there.  I don't know.  I don't like.  Some guy with his cat.  I don't like Catman.  Oh, I kind of like it.  You don't like Catman? 
[02:28:00]  I don't enjoy it.  What is this guy with a plant?  I don't know.  Excuse me, sir.  Is that cannabis sativa?  Is that marijuana?  He gave a little smile.  I don't know why after you said cannabis sativa did I have to jump in with marijuana?  You should have said radiation detector.  I really am awful.  Excuse me, sir.  Is that something growing out of the ground that can make people not feel sober?  What a boring jizz bucket.  Yeah, I didn't like Catman. 
[02:28:30]  He bugged me.  Yeah, I was my favorite.  Opie's walking ahead.  I'm freezing.  I realized I should have worn my coat on.  What the hell are you crazy?  Yeah.  Squeeze in the jimmies.  Oh, what?  I thought it was going to be like 60 today.  Why don't you wear...  You know something, Sam?  You should be a good guy and give Opie your hoodie.  I'd rather freeze.  Your $95 fucking rip-off girl hoodie.  Yeah, what's wrong with that baby hoodie?  Your safety pin hoodie. 
[02:29:00]  Safety pins.  That's right.  No, hey, that is the shit, man.  All right, see?  I mean, and by that I mean shit.  No, no, come on, Ant.  No.  Leave the young lad's hoodie alone.  Has anyone complimented you on that?  Yes.  Your girlfriend likes it.  Okay.  That's good.  Yeah.  Dude.  What?  Don't.  I didn't do anything.  All right, let's... 
[02:29:30]  Can we start walking?  I think Steve was writing on it.  Yeah, I saw that.  How about this?  Oh, God.  How about somebody walks behind him?  Yeah.  With a black or red Sharpie.  Oh, my God.  Steve put a big fucking...  Look, look.  Look at the line.  Where?  He drew a blue line with his pen on his $95 fucking hoodie.  What a scumbag.  But what can Sam do?  Nothing.  What can he do?  Steve.  I want to see...  I want to see just little fucking marker strips. 
[02:30:00]  Wow, look at this man in the hat.  Oh.  G'day.  Hello.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Luca Brasi.  I know.  With a fucking fedora.  He hasn't been the same since Edith died.  He gained a little weight.  Oh, I need money.  Why?  I'll have to go into the ATM later.  Well, we're about to walk into the ATM now.  It's called XM.  Ah, that's right.  We've got a huge crowd today. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  I don't like it.  A lot of people.  A lot of people for the walker.  What's up, guys?  I don't like the fact that Adrian Brody is behind me.  And Desmond Tutu walked by.  Oh, La La La game.  Dude, La La La game.  Dude.  Oh, yeah.  Why not?  We've got a lot of people today.  Okay, hold on.  Everyone, hold on.  All right.  Everyone paying attention?  Everyone's got to join in. 
[02:31:00]  God damn it.  Oh.  Hold on.  We have a gentleman using a cell phone.  I mean, a pay phone.  Who uses pay phones anymore?  And we like to play the La La game when we come upon this, which is very rare.  That was a short call. 
[02:31:30]  He just looked like he dicks.  He got a cell phone, cheapo.  That just makes me happy.  that was really good  that's nice for the crowd  don't feel like you're going to be the only one punched in the face  you won't know who to shoot  you guys listen to Kenny  he'll bring some of you upstairs  some of you lucky people  and thanks for doing the walk over today  big crowd out there  yeah  a lot of those people traveled  just to do the homeless shopping spree tomorrow with us 
[02:32:00]  speaking of babies  it looks like somebody emptied a baby diaper  and mushy baby shit  fell out behind the counter  and then the father dropped his tie  why would the father drop his tie  in wet and mushy baby shit  I don't know why anyone would do it  hi sir how are you  good morning  thank you my friend  happy holidays too  I'm a nice guy  we'll see you upstairs  they are the most 
[02:32:30]  vile despicable human beings in the country  creeps  ankle biters  obviously the strength is their ability to turn  mistruth into something people would believe  wow how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing  all day long  shut up  alright here we go  welcome to the opie and anthony show  it's worse than I imagined  that's terrible

[02:34:30]  I figured it'd be kind of funny  to um  hit the mic on  right when the music starts  because then people would be like  wow  uh  there was no time  they actually came up  and we didn't have to sit through that music  for so long  and then I realized  I got nothing to fucking say  haha  so  it was a big waste of time  I should have just  subjected the people  to the music  for a good minute and a half  two minutes  can we take a real break

[02:38:00]  what's the big announcement by the way  Fez  I don't know  flip a coin  I hope it's  really  that's one of those  one of those issues  from what I hear  well it's alright  I mean some people have dealt with that already  and others will deal with it properly  we'll see how it works out  oh right  speculate  speculate  go ahead people  pick it up  pick it up and run with it  you do that  you unknowing dolts  you know what's funny  people are checking out the XM commercial  the Opie and Anthony XM commercial  it's gonna be a national commercial by the way 
[02:38:30]  featuring Jimmy Norton  of course  the star of the commercial  I think  that's what I think too  there's gonna be many versions out there  they're gonna make a 60 second version  just for the internet  which is gonna be hilarious  the concept they got for that  is really good  and then they're gonna have  individual outtakes from all the players  yep  it'll be like the end of a Burt Reynolds movie  and Jimmy  and we're gonna just release this slowly  so far the commercial  we want everyone to see is up there  on Opie and Anthony dot com  and YouTube  and I think XM's website too 
[02:39:00]  and then we're gonna release  a couple other versions  then we're gonna release the outtakes  it's gonna be just a slow process  in the next couple of weeks  but  Jimmy doing alternate takes  of coming through that door  is just  gonna be hilarious  when you finally see that  hilarious  anyway  people are seeing the commercial  and they're like  how funny is it that  XM builds a fake studio  for you guys  for an Opie and Anthony  XM satellite radio commercial  but they can't build you a real one  you know something  that's true 
[02:39:30]  I used to have seen the commercial  they gave us a boss  who doesn't have a problem with alcohol  I'm like  this son of a bitch is right  what's that about  yeah  they spend all afternoon  building a fake  studio for us  so we can do this commercial  but we don't have a real one yet  nah  it takes too long  do people like the commercial  they hate it  they love it so far  the reviews coming in  they like  they like  yeah  let's say hi to Anthony 
[02:40:00]  in Brooklyn  Anthony what's up  hey you know  I hear little Jimmy  and Anthony  putting my namesake over there  yeah  making fun of the Italian voices  I'm offended  yeah  well  I can do it  because I'm Italian  my friend  oh  see but if  if an Irishman  or something did it  I would  it would be as bad  as saying nigger  to me  it would be  these people  need to get lives  it's a joke  and I don't mean to a black guy  I mean calling me a nigger 
[02:40:30]  I'd be very offended  so would blacks  have to hear that you were lumped in  you don't want him  huh  hey  did you find out what that noise was  with those Chinese guys  on that thing  that time you were asking people to call  to find out what that noise was  oh yeah  yeah we revealed that  weeks ago  my god  Jesus Christ  thanks Anthony  keep up with the times  yeah really  keep up with the times  I have no idea what he's talking about  by the way  do we have it  I mean we told everyone what it was  we'll find it  I just got a thing  thank you Nathaniel  a thing  well let me set it up by saying 
[02:41:00]  they dumped out of  Jimmy saying bukkake  on the first half  right  the radio show today  now bukkake is not profanity  so I said what is this  so they got me this paper  bukkake is the noun form  of the Japanese verb  bukkakaru  and means simply  splash or dash  the compound verb  can be decomposed  into two verbs  butsu  and kakaru  butsu literally means  to hit  but in this usage  it appears to be  an intensive prefix  such as  something else 
[02:41:30]  or something  means overwhelming wind  kakaru in the context  means to shower or pour  the word bukkake  is often used  in Japanese  to describe  pouring out water  or in quotes  or other liquids  with sufficient momentum  to cause splashing  or spilling  it is not  a dirty word  I don't care  what it's come to mean  in pop culture  it's not  a dirty word  can I play  the devil's advocate here  alright  let me get my horns  and wait 
[02:42:00]  I gotta put my little tail on  and a pitchfork  I keep the pitchfork here  ok  and  there it is  no  red makeup  oh  you usually put the red makeup on too  yeah ok  just on the face  and the back of the hands  what about this  obviously  I disagree  ok  conversation over  obviously  on regular FM radio  you could not say 
[02:42:30]  I blew a load  in her face  now  if a Japanese person  literally translated  blow a load  in her face  you would not  look at it  as offensive  the word blow  and load  are harmless  you could say it  even blow load  it doesn't necessarily mean  a cum shot  to the face  but  using your rules  it should be  fair game  I'll tell you 
[02:43:00]  what I think the difference  no you're wrong  I think all those  you're right  first of all  all those words  are in English  and blow the load  is such a part of our  culture  and it's a phrase  as opposed to  bukkake  which is just one word  and when you translate  the one word  it does mean  throwing liquid  but in Japan  the hand can be used  as a knife  in Japan  the word bukkake  may have been  bastardized  and turned into  just mean 
[02:43:30]  you know  it might have meant  that at some point  but it might have been  turned into  meaning  loads and loads  of man cum  dumped on a woman's face  well then it would have  just been called  boo yummy  now what is the  why cocky  what is the  is there any English  words that are like that  like that we could  just say  in content  like just throw it out there  like she's  how do I say it  I mean I did say it  but did anyone know  how I said it  well we got the line here  it's not like I said  a bunch of guys  line  okay good  you said please  men come here  and bukkake me  no no I would never say 
[02:44:00]  oh shit  now I just said it  and it's on tape  it certainly is  oh boy  I am a douche bag  well Jimmy you said  they draw the line  at bukkake videos  oh  so how is that  not allowed  I mean  if I said  a bunch of men  stood around her  and gave her  bukkake in the face  that's a problem  that's a more graphic thing  like the term  blow the load in the face  right  but Al  you're wrong about this one 
[02:44:30]  he used it as if  I would have said  I went to the  casino  and I sat at the  blackjack table  and I blew the load  in one hand  that would get through  because it's meant  as money  to say bukkake videos  is not  well  bad  Jason says it is  South Dakota  Jason  what does he know  who's Jason  hey boys  what do you know  I was calling you out  I remember when you guys  were getting ready  to go to FM  and you did the  Benny Hill reading  of all the SEC regulations 
[02:45:00]  yeah  one of the stipulations  was not to use  the word bukkake  yeah but that was  in FCC regulations  that's CBS  yeah we want to see  what the  like how was it  how was bukkake  used in the context  that we said  they can't use it  there's only seven words  the FCC actually states  that you can't use  and there's also  gray areas  fucking bukkake  as far as they're concerned  so  cocky isn't on it  let me tell you something  about fucking FM radio  they are such  pussies  look I'm happy 
[02:45:30]  to be on FM  it exposes us  to a lot more people  of course  but when I said  when I was annoyed  about Dell  and they told me  look  you know  Tom comes in  this product obsession  they have  anything remotely edgy  they won't let us  do fucking  money snatch  everything we try  to do over there  that has any  balls to it  they fucking squash  and they wonder  why people are  running away  come on guys  you gotta fucking  relax a little bit  there's no nudity  in the studio  I don't get it all  that's not even  negotiable  that's irritating 
[02:46:00]  they're like  no nudity  it's like you could  do this with chicks  and stuff  but they gotta have  bra and panties on  it's like why  can't a girl  just be naked  and do a stunt  or something  and we describe it  in the way  that is completely  within FCC boundaries  don't worry about it  but they're so  fucking gun shy  how about all those  years they fucking  filmed  I know on Howard's show  they would always  film naked girls  and just black it out  that's a big thing  to be able to do  on your show  that we've been  handcuffed on  it's irritating  well I'm hearing  stories also  that other personalities  are allowed 
[02:46:30]  certain liberties  that we are not  you're kidding me  no  we gotta talk  to some players  on what station  I'll tell you  when we go to break  because this is  a work in progress  can we definitely  can we get happy again  happy together  this does it for me  everyone calm down  oh you'll know  that's a signal  nice  the whole version  good  the ooze  here come the ooze 
[02:47:00]  you're not the one  for me  ooh ooh ooh  cause enough  enough  I saw the sign  and it opened up  my eyes  I saw the sign  oh I wish the sign  said hang yourself  without understanding  without understanding  I saw the sign  and it opened up  my eyes  and saw the sign  no one's gonna drag you up  to get into the light

[03:02:30]  Falls off  And the plane  Instantly goes into  A complete spin  Not like a, uh  A barrel roll spin  A flat spin  And just spins  All the way down to the ground  Like left to right spin  Yeah  As opposed to nose over tail  Yeah  A yaw spin  A fucking  At 35,000 feet  Wait, what?  A yaw spin  On the axis  You have pitch, roll  And yaw  It would be a yaw spin  How do you know that?  Uh  Flight simulator 
[03:03:00]  Forget Aristotle  And fuck Socrates  Here comes Professor Anthony  I was posting some pictures  On the website  Just the other day  Uh  Because we  One of the topics  Our flight simulator X  Which is out  From Microsoft  Uh  The latest one  And I was posting some pictures  Of, uh  I was flying a, um  A commuter jet  Were you?  Underneath the Verrazano Bridge  Which is very difficult  Very difficult maneuver  And, uh  Other  Other, uh  Disturbing pictures 
[03:03:30]  Is  Flying a 737  Where you can actually see  That you're  Lower than the Empire State Building  Over New York City  Oh, wow  That's pretty cool  Kind of a  Frightening picture  But, uh  Other people  Also add in their pictures  Yeah, you can try  I'm gonna try now  Uh  The next move  Wait, did you get it done  With the Verrazano?  Oh, yeah  I got it underneath  Nice  Uh, the next one is to do it  Upside down  Gonna try to  Invert  And then fly it  Under the Verrazano  Hey, were you flying  Cori Lytle Air?  It's like, uh  There's a TV  Uh, it's not in your seat though 
[03:04:00]  It'll be in the den  Oh, it's horrible  Fucking  That thing  At 35,000 feet  Spun  Left to right  All the way  The fucking  Horrifying death  That must have been  You just would be  Pinned against  Against the wall  Because you're doing  450, 500 miles an hour  By that point  You're at full speed  Cruising altitude  Somebody was on the toilet  When that happened  Because you're by that  The seatbelt signs are off  Yeah  Somebody was shitting in the bathroom  Or in the bathroom  Pissing  Pinned against the wall 
[03:04:30]  How many people died?  154  Every one of them on that plane  And then the two guys  In the other plane  Lived  Small plane  Lived  They were actually able to  Fly the plane  Land it  Without the wing tip  And with one half  With one of their stabilizers  Wow  The, uh, uh  Was it the port stabilizer?  It was gone  Completely gone  Off of the plane  And able to land it  And they were calling them  Like heroes  For actually getting this thing  On the ground  And, uh  They were arrested  And, uh  They could still face some charges 
[03:05:00]  Was it a  Trying to sort it out  Was it at night  Or during the day?  I think it was daytime  And they were cleared  For the altitude  That they were supposed  To be flying at  To have a midair  At that altitude  Is so rare  Just doesn't happen  Midairs happen  Takeoffs  Landings  High traffic areas  This is just  You're cruising  You don't expect anything to happen  Air traffic control  Cleared them  For the altitude  They were at  And, oops  Wow  Bang  Fuck  So look for that  Little simulation  On the news  And go  Oh, God 
[03:05:30]  And get creeped out  Uh, Indy Mike  What's up?  Morning, gentlemen  I'm sorry  If I'm sounding  A bit clueless here  But I've heard you  Talk again and again  About how the  Homeless shopping spree  Is from 2 to 6 tomorrow  But when are you guys  Going to be on XM?  Are you going to start  At 2?  Are you going to start  Earlier than that?  We're going to  It's going to be on XM  Tomorrow, right?

Take a long break  That's some  Jeez  If you crash head on  That's bad  But you're dead  I'll tell you  I'll tell you something  I don't know  Depending on  How  They were going  Really fast  You're at cruising  Altitude like that  If that plane  Gets hit on the wing  And spins  With the energy  It had moving forward  Going into a spin  Like that  They probably  Passed out 
[03:06:30]  From the G's  There's no way  You could sit there  In a spinning plane  That used about  500 miles an hour  Of energy  To put it into a spin  You know  You'd be  Probably ripped apart  They might not have  Spun that long  They might have spun  And then flipped over  And spun upside  You don't know  How long they spun for  I mean that's just  A simulation  One spin  You're unconscious  One spin  At that kind of  With those kind of G's  And you're unconscious  I don't know  How the plane  Might not even  Stay together  Coming down  But do you imagine 
[03:07:00]  Staying up through  Part of that  And you're falling  I do not want to imagine it  At all  But you're fucking  Falling dude  Yeah  And there's nothing  Can stop you  Like there's nothing  Like this will stop  In a second  Because the pilot  You're just  You're just fucking  You're falling  From 30,000 feet  Nothing's worse to me  Nothing  Than that TWA  Flight  Flight 800  That took off  Flight 800  Where the front of the plane  Blew off  The back of the plane  Was fine  Wing engines  Unaffected  And the engines  Were still being fed fuel 
[03:07:30]  Until you know  The controls  Screwed up  Because the cockpit  Now is gone  From the plane  Because it's now  Lighter in the front  The plane went  Into a climb  So it's missing  Its brain  The plane is  Brainless  And goes into a climb  And you're just  Sitting there going  Hey  What the  You know  It was at 13,000 feet  And it went up  For another 2,000 or 3,000 feet  Yeah  And then  Hey what the  What's happening  Merry Christmas everyone  Merry Christmas

[03:11:30]  Because there was these filthy fucking dice lines  That's a great idea  Florentine is just the funniest guy ever  He is a funny man  How many songs can you put on this?  This is cool  Up to 250 songs  I don't work out to that many  So it's perfect  On the iPod shuffle  You certainly don't wear it  Right on your sleeve  What?

If you already have an iPod hooked up  Does anybody know this?  And I happen to have one  Yeah  And I want to put this new thing with my account  Do I just plug it in and it will read it as a new account?

[03:12:30]  I know  Everything's a pain in the ass  I know  And I'm talking about even like stuff I enjoy using and everything  But everything just seems to be a pain in the ass  There's always a problem in the end  Whenever I network  I've been networking my computers at home for years  But every time I move and have to do it again  It never works  It takes the same amount of time as it did  The first time I cracked open a book on networking computers  To get it done again  For some reason it's like 
[03:13:00]  Alright, I have it hooked up exactly like I did before  Everything's in the way it is  Let me get online  Ah, nothing  For some reason  Everything is a pain in the ass  That just takes hours to do  So, Jimmy  In short, no  It won't be easy  And I don't know why  If I just plug it in  I'm wondering if it will just recognize  Yeah, sure  It'll say, hi, Jimmy  What songs you want to put on?

[03:23:30]  Oh my god  Alright, hold on  Can I  Right in the mouth  Can I interrupt?  Because the listeners  They might as well produce the show at this point  Because they're the ones coming up with all the great ideas  Jake from Texas  Go ahead  Hey, uh, why don't you have everybody in the room write down the craziest stuff they've done on a piece of paper  And y'all try to figure it out just by then  Slow clap, slow clap  See, this is what a producer should be doing  There it is  Alright, we get him to write it down  Then no one will know 
[03:24:00]  It'll be completely anonymous  That's right, just put your name  Hand out  Oh, Jake, man  Thank you so much  Then we'll read them  And try to figure out who it is  Alright, we're gonna take a break  Everyone gets a piece of paper  And a pen or pencil  As a parting gift  Get the fuck out  That's right  And you gotta write something down  And we'll try to guess  And you don't have to  If we guess right  You don't have to say  Now, be honest  But you have to be honest  And tell us the craziest thing you have done  We know it's in there somewhere lurking in the back of your head 
[03:24:30]  And we'll write down ours, too  We'll mix them in with yours  Yeah, that's a good idea  Alright, we'll take a break  And we'll continue with the studio audience next  The Norton and Faggot Show  That's what we should call it, program  I know how to handle cock  All my cocks got in  iPods  Corn on the cob  Smoothies  Egg white omelets  Bagels and seltzer  Starbucks apple cake  Absolutely
