<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous discussion about lengthy Senate filibusters, referencing Rand Paul and Strom Thurmond.  The hosts speculated on the physical realities of such prolonged speeches, including bathroom needs. They then listed the top five longest filibusters, detailing the senators, durations, and legislation involved.  The conversation abruptly shifted to the ethics and legality of drone strikes on American soil, exploring hypothetical scenarios involving civilian casualties and due process.  This transitioned into a discussion about UFO sightings, prompted by a Russell Crowe claim, with explanations ranging from misinterpretations to government experimentation.  The hosts briefly touched on WrestleMania before returning to Rand Paul’s filibuster, playing audio clips and segueing into seemingly unrelated stories: a deceased intern at an animal sanctuary killed by a lion (detailed with graphic, offensive humor), and a bizarre anecdote about a lion, monkey, and ostrich.

The show continued with a discussion about a man’s unusual glasses, likened to those worn by Mo Green after being shot. This led to a discussion of Mark Rubio quoting Wiz Khalifa and Jay-Z in a speech, which devolved into a discussion of childhood games involving physical abuse. A caller, James from North Carolina, voiced his anti-gun control views and criticized New York City's policing.  The hosts then discussed the meaning of "repurposed,"  followed by a fictional "Valley Gym" skit.  Promotional material for various shows, including a Mike Tyson daytime show and a sexually explicit dating show "Unmatchables" with Jim Jefferies and Justine Jolie, was aired. A hostile phone call interrupted the promotion, resulting in an angry exchange. The segment concluded with a detailed analysis of a heavily photoshopped publicity photo of Opie and Anthony, highlighting numerous flaws and blaming a graphics employee named Mark.  Upcoming guests Daryl Hammond and potentially Don King were mentioned, alongside a pre-recorded bit with Troy Kwan.  The segment ended with a tense exchange between Opie and Jimmy.

The next segment focused primarily on the aforementioned photoshopped publicity photo, detailing its numerous flaws: Opie's elongated neck and double Adam's apple, Anthony's "baby arm" and missing thumb, and inconsistencies throughout the image.  They compared it to a corrected version, noting the extensive editing.  The hosts discussed the lion killing the animal sanctuary intern in graphic detail, laced with offensive humor. They also reviewed a since-deleted, offensive video by an Indiana University student. The segment concluded with the arrival of comedian Daryl Hammond, briefly mentioning his upcoming shows at Caroline's and the possibility of Don King appearing on the show.


Comedian Daryl Hammond then joined the show as a guest.  He discussed his upcoming performances and his book, "If there's a God up there, I'm fucked," explaining its title and the distribution problems it caused. He detailed a serious car accident that impacted the book's publication and his subsequent physical and emotional recovery, including his use of OxyContin. He discussed his therapy, revealing repressed memories of his mother's abuse, and shared a poignant story about his father and his father's involvement in war atrocities. He also discussed his career on *Saturday Night Live*, including his impressions of various presidents and other figures, and compared his approach to other impressionists. He concluded by promoting his show at Caroline's.


The show then shifted back to impressions, specifically focusing on Daryl Hammond's *SNL* work and a search for a John McCain impression clip. This led to a discussion of an office conflict between producers Eric and Sal, referred to as "pussies" for their passive-aggressive behavior. Who Kid joined the show, sharing anecdotes about his life. Chris D'Elia also briefly appeared to promote his show at Caroline's, discussing his girlfriend, Carly Aquilino. The conversation was punctuated by vulgar language and frequent digressions.

Finally, a caller, Chris, detailed his deep love for his girlfriend, despite past infidelity.  The conversation was sexually explicit and vulgar, featuring references to Rihanna and crude jokes. Chris promoted his own upcoming comedy shows and DJ gigs, including one with members of the Bloodhound Gang, and a Dollar Shave Club advertisement was integrated into the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio!  You know, I just came up with a version of it that was good enough to be funny, but it really wasn't really sad.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Well, that's more like it.  What?  What?  Well, we're out doing a show.  Oh, after that dramatic open?  Yeah.  Yeah, we take ourselves a little too seriously, huh?  Yes.  Welcome to the four-hour filibuster that is the Oberg and Anthony program. 
[00:00:30]  You want to filibust?  Let's filibust.  If he could do 13 hours, we could do four hours.  Oh, hell yeah.  Why don't we do four hours without commercials?  It's a four-hour filibuster.  Are they going to panic down the hall if we try to do that?  They would panic about that?  Oh, my God.  We've got to get our, you know, products in there.  Yeah, we could just throw those in.  It would be kind of cool if Rand Paul would have done fucking live reads during his filibuster.  For Shave Club.  And Shave Club.  You know, I'm getting a little grubby here at the podium as I'm filibustering here against drone attacks on American citizens. 
[00:01:00]  But, you know, when I do, I have to shave.  And he said he had to leave the floor.  Was it for number one or number two?  I would think number one.  He was there for 13 hours filibustering without any breaks.  So my point is this.  Why wouldn't you pee your pants without?  Peeing your pants on the floor.  Who gives a fuck if?  I don't know.  But if you want to keep going, because he sort of wanted to go for the record at one point.  Yeah, 24 hours or 25 hours?  28 hours.  28 hours, was it? 
[00:01:30]  I believe.  Not to correct you, sir, but I think it's 28 hours.  Who was that?  That was the old...  That was Strom.  Strom Thurmond.  Good old Strom Thurmond.  Yeah.  The filibuster record at it.  28 hours.  I think it was 28 hours.  And Ryan Paul made it to 13 and said he had to kind of take a, you know, go to the bathroom.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to leave to take a bathroom break.  You're not allowed to eat, really.  You can...  He was eating, like, a piece of candy bar real quick.  But you...  The thing is, you have to continuously talk.  Right.  You can't stop talking.  Although he did have some of his buddies kind of throw some shit at him where they would 
[00:02:00]  speak a little bit.  Give him, like...  Give him a couple minutes.  Lozenges, apparently.  How is that allowed?  Well, it's not really.  I mean, they don't really do it anymore.  They don't really do it anymore.  You're only able to, like, call a filibuster.  You say, ah, this is a filibuster.  And they kind of give you a virtual filibuster.  They harumph you.  Harumph, harumph.  And they acknowledge it, and then they move on.  It's not totally a bad thing. 
[00:02:30]  I mean, it really does show that a politician does have a passion for a cause.  Right.  And, um...  Well, I just wish he would have peed his pants and kept going.  Well, that would have been good.  I bet people would have understood.  I think they would have.  I think you're supposed to wear a diaper or something when you decide to filibuster.  Are you really?  Yeah.  If you'd want to filibuster, you'd put on a little diety.  Piss yourself and shit.  Would you make duty in your...  I don't think I'd make duty.  In your filibuster pants.  I would say, if I think I'm going to be filibustering...  Then you don't have passion, sir. 
[00:03:00]  You would have to take a big dump first.  Big dump.  And, uh, take a piss.  Yeah, but 13 hours, you're making more.  Yeah, but you got to make...  13 hours, you're making more duties.  You got to know in advance not to eat.  You know.  I think you got to fucking make the duties in your filibuster pants.  That'd be kind of crazy.  Oh, you got the filibuster stuff there, Sam Roberts.  Wow.  So is it Phil or Buster?  Which one is them?  I was going to say Buster or Phil, but that's even better.  Of course it's...  Hey, man.  We only have five minutes.  He was...  What? 
[00:03:30]  He did it for 13 hours.  This must be really good.  You missed a few minutes here.  Well, I figured we could do what we do sometimes.  We just watch the whole filibuster on YouTube.  We could do that.  Oh, my God.  Could we do that?  Oh, let's do that.  I wish we had a meter of our audience just to watch it just dropping and dropping and dropping.  The first nine hours is up there on YouTube.  Is it really?  So we could try...  We could do, like, you know...  He didn't even get into the top five longest filibusters.  Who's the top five? 
[00:04:00]  Can we go over the list and why?  Well...  I love old school politics.  Should I do five to one or one to five?  Oh, you got to start at number five.  All right, number five.  We already know Strom Thurmond's number one because we gave it away, but...  Senator William Proxmere.  Oh.  In 1981 spoke for 16 hours and 12 minutes to stall debate on an increase of the public debt ceiling.  All right.  How did that work out?  Not well.  How's the debt ceiling these days?  We just keep moving that shit higher and higher, right?  Of course. 
[00:04:30]  Number four.  I love that you can do that.  That's great.  It's the greatest thing ever.  Just raise the debt ceiling.  Yeah, okay.  16 hours.  Number four.  Senator Robert Lafollette, Sr.  Oh, Sr.  Spoke for 18 hours, 23 minutes to stall debate in 1908.  Why was he stalling?  It halted debate on a currency bill, which permitted the U.S. Treasury to lend currency to banks  during fiscal crisis.  Lending money to a bank?  That sounds weird.  Sounds insane. 
[00:05:00]  Who would do that?  That's dumb.  That was stuff we had to deal with 100 years ago, though.  I know.  We don't do that anymore, obviously.  Number three is Senator Wayne Morse.  Yeah.  In 1953, spoke for...  He spoke in code.  A lot of dots and dashes.  Oh, boy.  I like it.  He spoke for 22 hours.  Better get him on fucking cold medicine.  22 hours and 26 minutes to stall debate on the Tideland's oil bill.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Do you?  You do?  No.  All right.  Number two, Senator Alphonse D'Amato. 
[00:05:30]  Al D'Amato?  Al.  Al.  Our own Al D'Amato.  23 hours, 30 minutes.  Jesus.  To stall debate on an important military bill.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Could you stop?  Yeah.  23 hours and 30 minutes.  He couldn't make it a full fucking day.  You don't look at the clock and go, wow, 30 minutes to go and it's officially a full day?  Nope.  Oh, man.  What the fuck do you think happened there?  You think the duties were just pushing?  I was running down his leg.  His shoes were full.  That was 86.  And then in 92, he did one for 15 hours. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  So, you know, combine those.  Isn't it amazing there's no time limit on this?  Why can't these guys just talk for an hour?  Shut the fuck up.  They're up there for a reason.  You had to stall things.  Gum up the works.  It's a weird loophole, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, how did the filibuster start?  Oh, man.  I have no idea.  I was asleep in school that day.  Oh, you think it was a woman that started this nonsense?  What was Strom doing?  Filibustering the, uh, he didn't want to put blacks in schools or something?  Basically, he was protesting against Civil Rights Act of 1957. 
[00:06:30]  Well, he was.  Yes.  24 hours, 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.  You know how much you have to dislike blacks to talk for 24 straight hours against civil rights?  He recited the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, George Washington's farewell address, and other historical documents.  He just recited shit?  Yep.  Oh, that would be annoying.  The fact that fucking black women filibuster in every movie I've ever gone to.  See, they don't shut up.  At least Rand Paul was using new shit.  Yeah.  He wasn't doing cover shit. 
[00:07:00]  That's true, yeah.  Strom Thurmond was just, he's a cover center.  Yeah, he was just doing cover shit.  Rand Paul, all new material.  Yeah.  I like it.  Strom Thurmond's a tribute band.  He sure is.  Why was he filibustering drone attacks?  I'm sick of hearing about drone attacks on American people.  Well, you don't want that.  I think that's not a good sense.  On American soil, they don't want it.  Oh, soil.  He doesn't want it.  Yeah.  Obviously, if we're using drones to kill people overseas, it's because we really don't have  the ability to go in there with people and get to them and arrest them and then have them in the legal system. 
[00:07:30]  But you've got to assume in America, you could arrest people and try them and the old due process gag.  But aren't they bad guys?  They're bad guys.  So what's the problem?  Well, it sort of seems like you're a judge, a jury, an executioner with your little drone.  Nice.  If some guy's in a, you know, you've got some guy like, let's say, the Unabomber.  He's in his little cabin.  Right.  He's making bombs. 
[00:08:00]  You know it's him.  Right.  Do you send in people to arrest him like they did?  Or do you just send a drone and blow the whole cabin up?  Well.  And then make up a thing later.  How about Waco?  The whole thing with Waco, Texas.  How about, no, let's go way more current.  Dorner.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that guy.  That guy in the cabin.  That would have been an example of using a drone to kill somebody, and it would have  been very controversial.  Right.  Like, hey, wait a minute.  Doesn't this guy deserve a trial? 
[00:08:30]  Even though.  But they burned him alive.  Well, they certainly did.  Where was his trial there?  He was saying not to walk out.  They didn't burn him alive.  I'm just playing the other side.  What's the difference between the two?  Well, they didn't burn him alive.  They gave him a chance to fucking come out?  Yeah, and then they sent in some flashbangs and stuff, and they inadvertently said.  It's hard to say you inadvertently exploded a building with a drone.  Lying.  You can say I inadvertently set the place on fire with gas canisters.  Liar.  But, yeah. 
[00:09:00]  Well, can't you do something with the drone where you give him a chance and go, look,  drone in the sky.  It's your move.  I don't think he would care at that point.  But I'm just saying in general.  It takes the legal system out of the loop, and that's what people don't really.  But a lot of us don't believe in the legal system.  Um, well, I think a lot of us do.  Not a lot.  Yeah, I don't know.  You truly believe in the legal system?  Um, I certainly don't think it's without its flaws and stuff. 
[00:09:30]  But I do think with the amount of things that have to be settled in it, it's amazing  they get anything done.  That's true.  To be honest with you.  But, yeah, I would like to see, um, people, uh, I would like to see people, uh, prosecuted  for the crimes that they commit and not let go.  I'd like a revamp of the parole system and things like that.  But, uh, you know, it's all we got at this point.  You know, the Aurora shooter, they're not even thinking death penalty for that guy. 
[00:10:00]  Well, I know.  That's why I think the legal system really has some major fucking flaws.  No death penalty for him.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No, I think, uh, officially they decide it's not a death penalty case.  How is that not?  I don't know.  Uh, there'll be, there'll be someone calling in minutes to tell us how it's not.  I don't want to listen to that.  And it's some people going to a fucking movie and being executed like that.  Yeah.  How is that not a death penalty case?  Children? 
[00:10:30]  You know, I've, I've heard about some instances, um, where.  What about a drone for that case?  For, uh, no, I don't think a drone would work for that.  Not, well, obviously, because he's in the movie theater.  But let's say he's, uh, now out in the parking lot.  And they got him cornered pretty good.  But he's armed pretty, uh, you know, he's got a lot of fucking ammo.  Well, you got your little standoff.  You got your cops there on the ground.  I think the drones are, you know, primarily used for when you don't have people on the ground.  You know?  Kind of like a, a Waco?  A Waco situation in this day and age where you got a guy in a compound with some people. 
[00:11:00]  But they do have innocent women and children in there.  So, again, they wanted to send in people on the ground.  I, I, I don't know of many circumstances here in the United States where you would need a drone attack.  I think, I think perhaps if you had a, a gaggle of people running with RPGs toward an airport runway and you were able to get a drone there immediately, that could probably be a good reason to blow them up, uh, as they're running to wreak havoc. 
[00:11:30]  But we're, but we won't, we won't be allowed to do that.  Um, I don't think so.  But it does, it seems very far-fetched that that would ever happen.  But it's imminent danger, I think, is what people are saying a drone would be used for against American citizens.  And who's worried about this?  Uh, worried about using them or not using them?  Uh, using them.  Using them, I think, you know, uh, Civil Liberties, uh, Union, a lot of, um, a lot of people that are against the President's policies that just want them to look bad. 
[00:12:00]  Um, but I think it's, I know, I know I'll never get in major trouble where I, I have to worry about a drone chasing me.  Well, there you go.  You gotta hope that wouldn't happen.  The only problem is if they're talking to you by mistake.  Right, that's another thing.  That's the only problem I have with it.  If there's a mistake made that, that the thing is coming at you, you can't reason we're going to talk to it.  Damage, malfunction, yeah.  My whole point is it's hard to hold back this, uh, new technology that comes about.  It really is.  I mean, eventually, what, we're going to have this drone technology really figured out and we're not going to use it? 
[00:12:30]  I, uh, I, I know.  I bet you eventually we're not going to be able to help ourselves, right or wrong.  It would have to be practical for the military or police agencies to even use it.  Like, I don't think it's practical to send a drone in to kill somebody.  When the police are available to go in, either negotiate, kill him, arrest him, save the, uh, area he's in for, uh, evidence if there is a trial against other people that he's involved with. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  It just seems to me like, um, well, like it's very extreme.  Well, well, could he use a drone to send in sleepy smoke?  Sleepy smoke?  Those canisters always seem to burst into flames, though.  Well, why not use the drone to, like, you know, send in the sleepy smoke?  Send in sleepy smoke?  I don't know.  Now we get the guy and then he's not dead.  I got to read more about sleepy smoke.  That might not be as fucking, absolutely stupid as it just sounded.  There might be something else they can do with it, where you don't kill the person. 
[00:13:30]  Well, there is, and a lot of people automatically think that if drones are used against American citizens committing crimes,  that it's automatically going to be a Hellfire missile sent into their fucking house.  Right.  Surveillance is a huge part of it.  If you have a compound where some nefarious acts are going on, or you've got some suspect that something's going on,  you could fly a drone above it and get a lot of intelligence off of what's happening on the ground using a drone. 
[00:14:00]  Whether you're going to use it to kill the person with, you know, that's a little further off.  And people are still arguing whether even that type of surveillance should be used against American citizens,  because then the privacy angle comes in.  Well, didn't we have this conversation, I don't know, let's call it ten years ago,  when the cameras started popping up all over the place?  Exactly.  And now we just accept it, unfortunately.  We do. We do.  I remember when those cameras started popping up outside, like on light poles and street corners and outside storefronts. 
[00:14:30]  People were all like, what the fuck?  And then a story came out, which now everyone understands and accepts, but at the time you're like, what?  They said you were on camera more than you weren't when you left your house.  And that blew everyone's minds.  It made everyone crazy.  But now, because that was brand new technology.  My point is that was brand new technology that we just couldn't stop.  You have an expectation of privacy.  I know.  That's what it is.  I'm wondering if we're going to be able to stop the whole drone technology eventually. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Or if we're just wasting time.  When you have cameras all around the city and you're walking around in public, you can't have an expectation of privacy.  You're in public.  There's cameras that are there.  Right.  There's surveillance and whatnot.  No, that's what we understand today.  Yeah, exactly.  My point is, there was a time where, like, this is crazy.  We can't allow this to happen.  Yeah.  But now it's what it is.  But their argument was always, you're in public.  Here's the cameras.  Right.  Now, with drones, it's very hard to make that argument that your expectation of privacy doesn't extend to your own yard, maybe through windows of your house. 
[00:15:30]  Because now these other drones, let's say the guy isn't a criminal, for every sense of the word, but he's suspect.  Or perhaps he's been putting out anti-government literature or whatever it is.  Right.  Now you've got a drone where there is no camera around.  The guy expects privacy, yet his privacy is being totally invaded by these cameras that are so high up that they can't even see the vehicle. 
[00:16:00]  Are you expected to have privacy?  Can that video of you and what you're doing be used against you, or is it an intrusion on your privacy?  Those are the big questions now.  Right.  I'm all about the sleepy smoke, though.  You like the sleepy smoke?  Nothing wrong with throwing some sleepy smoke and checking everything out.  Can't you just throw sleepy smoke in?  You mean like a crop duster, like dust and sleepy smoke everywhere.  You know what?  Crop dusters with sleepy smoke. 
[00:16:30]  Just the whole area.  Yeah, man.  You can check out whole neighborhoods.  Then you just go in, you pick his head up by his hair, and go, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, that's not the guy.  He's snoozing.  He's snoozing.  Yeah, hey, this ain't even him.  Put him in bed, he'll forget.  Right.  He'll just think he passed out.  Put an empty bottle in his hand.  I mean, it's all about the drones lately, and I think that technology is so amazing that  we're not going to be able to hold that back.  Yes.  I'm on theblaze.com this evening, doing an hour-long show on Real News, it's called. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  And we'll be discussing drones, domestic, military, all aspects of droneyism.  Apparently, I'm the go-to drone guy now.  I was going to say, you are the go-to guy.  I'm the between, like, a simple little toy and predator drones killing people.  I'm the middle guy.  No, you're not the middle guy.  No?  You're more toward, uh.  I know the toys.  I bought one for my nephews this Christmas.  Oh, they're great.  That's the sharper image shit. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  You're way beyond the sharper image shit.  That's where it starts.  That was a fucking stepping stone toy.  You turned me on to that.  Oh, the thing's pisser.  My nephews love them.  Fly it around.  It's a lot of fun.  But theirs only go.  Oh, my fucking...  Just trying to get phlegm out.  You're all phlegmy.  Oh, it's horrible.  And is bronchitis, like, can you, like, is that contagious?  Lord, I ain't got time for bronchitis!  My wife's got bronchitis officially.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  The whole family is still fucking dealing with shit.  If you're in a bad way.  Well, can I get that?  Get bronchitis?  Yeah.  How does that work?  I don't know if bronchitis is, like, um, like, uh, contagious.  Yeah.  I don't know either.  I think bronchitis, like, is something and it turns into bronchitis.  It's kind of like an infection that gets out of...  Lord, it's a fire!  Out of control a little bit?  Yeah.  Just something like that.  What was I saying before I started coughing up phlegm?  Sharper image, you're way above that.  Yeah, you can't get those things up too high, but you can absolutely peer in windows with 
[00:18:30]  the sharper image ones.  I might have seen a thing, too.  Yeah, you could do that.  I mean...  And it was recording video and whatnot.  Imagine if we had that growing up.  Oh, please.  Fucking jealous of what the kids have today.  Please.  That's the whole thing that started me off.  I bought one of those because I saw it online.  It looked cool.  Flew it around for quite a while.  A lot of fun.  And then I went online and looked at what the next level was.  I'm like, oh.  And then the level after that, oh.  And then I just decided, you know what? 
[00:19:00]  Why don't I just go for it?  You leveled all the way up.  And level up and see what the fuck is available out there.  The one video they had of yours on Fox News where...  Yeah, yeah.  Where everything kind of...  The landing gear goes up.  Goes up.  Get out of the way of the cameras.  That looks like some UFO shit.  Crazy.  It's fucking crazy.  And you know they were figuring...  That's where all the UFOs come from.  Yeah.  Because they were trying this shit out somewhere and then somebody, you know, caught a glimpse.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Because the one video with the landing gear going up... 
[00:19:30]  I don't know if we're going to make the whole show today.  Fuck.  That looks like a fucking UFO.  It does look like a UFO.  It looks like some type of alien craft.  Five years ago, if you saw that, and I guarantee they were already testing that,  shit five years ago, you would have lost your mind if you saw that in the sky.  What is it?  Now you're almost going to...  You'll accept it another year or two.  It's got like flashing lights on it that...  Because you've got to know what's going on on the thing.  Right.  And there's only so much that's on the computer screen, like just altitude, speed, attitude, 
[00:20:00]  things like that.  But you've got to know what's going on with it as far as battery power.  Is it picking up a GPS signal?  So all that is transmitted back down to me visually with the flashing light.  So it's different colors and different flash sequences that let me know what's going on  with the actual craft.  So it looks like insane.  You're getting flashing lights and everything.  And then it's got green lights on all the spars except for the front two are red to  let you know which direction it's facing and when it's up high.  So when you look at those things, especially at dusk or at night, it's insane looking. 
[00:20:30]  It looks like there's something that isn't supposed to be up there flying around.  It's pretty cool.  Well, Russell Crowe...  Russell Crowe had a UFO on his camera of a...  Apparently he puts a camera out by his office out there in Australia.  And he's been tweeting that he captured a UFO.  And this is so stupid.  I know what it is.  I did this as a gag a while ago on my Instagram. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  If you turn off all the lights in your house, but you keep one light on and then you take  pictures through a window, that light will look like it's floating outside.  It looks like a UFO, yeah.  And I did that purposely and said, holy fuck, I think I captured a UFO.  And most people that are cool went with it and had fun with it.  And then everyone else had to fucking point out the fucking idiots.  Easy!  Let's see, I can't do the voice today.  The light from inside your house!  I'm like, I know that.  I'm just fucking around here. 
[00:21:30]  Can't you just go with it?  It's stupid!  But if you do it just right, you can't tell it's the actual light fixture.  I think a lot of UFO pictures from the day, especially when there was that whole fucking  renaissance of UFO sightings, was reflections off of glass.  Either intentionally or unintentionally, people would make these pictures that looked like  something.  It's kind of a ghostly image.  It's in the sky.  It's blurry, so it's hard to make out what it is.  But they looked impressive, some of them. 
[00:22:00]  I live way up in the sky, and if I turn off all my living room lights with the TV on,  I could actually watch TV floating over the Hudson River.  From the window, right?  It's amazing!  All reverse, though, right?  Yeah.  It's a mirror image.  But it looks like I'm watching TV floating over the Hudson River.  It's great, unless you're playing Wheel of Fortune.  But, I mean, I think that's what the Russell Crowe thing is, because this isn't a moving 
[00:22:30]  video.  It's just a bunch of snapshots.  He's swearing that he saw a UFO.  It's so bad.  But it really looks like a light fixture, doesn't it?  Well, there's, first of all, there's a red reflection on the top of the screen, and then  something blue on the bottom, and it kind of comes into frame, and it looks like it's in  the sky, far away, and it's big, and then it crossed in front of the trees, so then  it looks like it's, like, right in his yard, really small.  Yeah, but...  So, it's a reflection. 
[00:23:00]  Well, you see the pillar on the right?  That looks like it's a reflection from inside the house.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  It looks almost too obvious.  I say it's ball lightning or swamp gas.  Oh, shit.  Those are the two biggies back in the 60s.  Ball lightning!  Swamp gas!  The guy who started, they put in charge of Project Blue Book back in the 60s, which  was to debunk UFOs, who was a complete skeptic, and he debunked most of them, but there was  some that he couldn't, and he actually wound up being convinced that they existed. 
[00:23:30]  Like, the guy in the military, they actually became a believer.  But I think a lot of it is technology we're working on, that they're not ready to show  the public, and then that's, you know, people are catching that shit in the sky.  Between us and the Soviets back then, just trying for, I mean, everything, the space  program, new weaponry, new means of just civilian transportation, there was so much  unknown shit in the sky back then that everything looked like a UFO.  But we just assumed as Joe Citizen that we knew everything. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  We didn't realize that the government was working on some really cool shit that would  blow our minds, but they weren't ready to show us yet.  Like, like the stealth, the whole stealth technology, they had to test that shit out  for years.  And that looked crazy, and it was just completely, they flew it at night, it was black with no  lights on it, and people would see or hear or feel this presence and be like, oh, it's  got to be a UFO.  Right.  But meanwhile, yeah, it's just something the military was working on.  And that's why it's always out in the middle of nowhere, because that's where they're  fucking testing this shit. 
[00:24:30]  Skunkworks are.  They're not testing it, you know, in Jersey?  Yeah, yeah.  I believe in aliens.  I don't, I don't know if they're like, I don't know if they have an interest in this  planet to be, you know, checking it out like that.  Or if that one in a fucking quadrillion chance that they would pick this little dot in the  sky.  Piece of dust floating in the room.  Yeah, we figured that out.  It's a piece of dust.  Crazy.  I saw a picture yesterday of a bunch of galaxies, a cluster of galaxies, and it's a photo that 
[00:25:00]  looks immediately like you're just looking at somebody snapped a picture of the sky,  and they're stars.  Right.  And you look at it and realize every one of those dots are galaxies.  Right.  They're all little spiral galaxies all in this frame.  Right.  So every one of those, is it just a giant thing of stars?  Right.  And they could have planets around.  It fucking, look at that.  Dude, those are all galaxies, not even just stars.  Wow, that looks like a whole bunch of mosquitoes.  Right.  And that's just a little piece of the sky. 
[00:25:30]  And each one of those fucking galaxies has billions of stars in them.  They're at least 20 miles apart, too.  Each.  Oh, it could be 25, 30.  Yeah, that's why.  It's obvious.  There's so much life out there.  Stop already.  The amount of space in space is crazy.  Right.  And then we brag because we made it to the moon.  Oh, woo-hoo!  It's got to be somewhere out there in the universe, like, pointing and laughing at us.  I know.  That's nothing.  That piece of dust over there is bragging because it went to a smaller piece of dust. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Nothing.  Right next to it.  Right next to it, right.  Nothing.  They pretty much could jump on it.  Yeah.  Doesn't it feel like when you look at those things, like, there's a place in the universe  where you look up and you feel close to everything.  Like, we're far away, but if you're in the middle of that, you can look out and go,  oh, there's the galaxy right there, and there's a bunch of...  Yeah.  But they see it the same way we do.  Exactly, yeah.  Black and a few dotted stars.  And some dots in their own galaxy.  Everyone's point of view is kind of the same.  Yeah.  Shit.  And looking up, going, there's no way to fucking really explore all that. 
[00:26:30]  You know, you could take your chances and send something out, a probe like Voyager and  stuff that barely gets out of our own solar system in 35 fucking years or whatever it's  been.  And then meanwhile, that's nothing compared to how much distance.  And what did they teach us growing up?  We had one galaxy, really?  The universe was...  No, they kind of knew that there was other galaxies, but...  But they weren't really sure, though.  They didn't have very good photographic evidence of it.  Right.  And the amount of galaxies and these galaxy clusters and stuff, yeah, they, you know, over the 
[00:27:00]  years, they've gotten some pretty cool-looking shit.  I was watching a Hubble thing on my TV.  You get these 3D shows about the Hubble, and it's amazing.  Just the shit's coming right at you.  It's pretty fucking cool.  All I'm picturing is looking in Anthony's window in his front door, and just seeing him alone  with 3D glasses on you and watching a telescope show. 
[00:27:30]  You could very well see that, Jim, if you looked in the window.  I have been known to don my 3D glasses and watch a television program all by my lonesome.  Too funny.  I have fun at my house.  So what are we going to do with the filibuster?  You want to play some of the highlights?  Yeah, I would love to hear this.  I don't just know what a filibuster highlight is.  It's Ryan Paul and his 13-hour filibuster.  Was it officially 13 hours?  Yeah.  He should have made the top five, at least. 
[00:28:00]  He should have made in his pants.  You're making your pants.  You got to make duty.  I think it's part of the understanding of doing something like that.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's Ryan Paul starting the whole thing.  I rise today to begin to filibuster John Brennan's nomination for the CIA.  I will speak until I can no longer speak.  I will speak as long as it takes until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our Constitution 
[00:28:30]  is important, that your rights to trial by jury are precious, that no American should be killed  by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found  to be guilty by a court, that Americans could be killed in a cafe in San Francisco, or in  a restaurant in Houston, or at their home in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is an abomination. 
[00:29:00]  It is something that should not and cannot be tolerated in our country.  I don't rise to oppose John Brennan's nomination simply for the person.  I rise today for the principal.  There you go.  He's running out of steam already.  Oh, man, right?  He's making his point.  And it worked because all the news agencies are picking it up today.  He would have just gone up there and spoken about it. 
[00:29:30]  And like everything else, you never would have heard about this.  You never would have heard about this.  But now it's like, top story on all the political shows are about Rand Paul and his filibuster.  So, I don't know.  And he's making a good point about the fact that, you know, you can't just blow people up.  You'd think they would take out someone in a cafe like that?  That's just it.  The thing is, they were asking Holder questions about fucking this drone policy.  Attorney General Holder. 
[00:30:00]  And he could not answer a straight question whether a drone under new legislation could be used to kill an American citizen on American soil.  And he, all he would do is sit there and go, well, to get into hypothetical situations and, you know, obviously we wouldn't want it to.  And then he turned around and he said, look, hey, excuse me, Mr. Attorney General, I worded this question so simply as to get a simple answer. 
[00:30:30]  And your answer should be no.  And he couldn't fucking say that no, these will not be used to take an American life on American soil.  And if you're going to say, yes, it will be used, then we need to know what the criteria is and what the other collateral parts of this could be if it's being used.  Does the person have to be completely alone?  What about collateral damage with the people that are around him?  Property damage. 
[00:31:00]  The airspace.  Airspace.  I mean, there's so many questions that need to be answered, but they won't even answer the question, will, can it be used under current legislation?  They're so scared to answer questions with yes or no in Washington.  Right.  A simple yes or no.  It's infuriating.  Here's Rand Paul talking about nothing getting done in Washington.  Exactly.  Some of the highlights from his 13-hour filibuster.  They're willing, when they are willing to admit to any kind of limitations on their power, they say policy-wise they might be limited, but they're not willing to say legally they are limited. 
[00:31:30]  And this is a problem of not just this administration, but the previous one, of thinking that any kind of inch that they give to another branch of government, that they will be losing some of their power and they're unwilling to do it.  We're going to have a committee hearing on this at a later date.  It'll never be discussed.  Nothing ever happens around here.  I mean, they promise you stuff.  They say we're going to take care of it.  He's killing.  But it never happens, and I think it never will. 
[00:32:00]  Wow.  The time to discuss the appropriate scope of the president's authority.  This is Friedersdorf again.  The time to discuss the appropriate scope of the president's authority is now.  I really like the Pauls, man.  Yeah, I really do.  They are a fun bunch.  I really like the Pauls.  Did this guy become a superstar in politics, you think?  He's moving up, man.  He's moving up a little bit.  I noticed his name popping up more and more.  He's made some noise.  And, yeah, I mean, the Pauls are very honest and straight shooters. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  You know, if they've got an issue with something, they're willing to say it and put it out there.  We said it last week, you know, if you vote against your party because you know that's the right thing to do and you know that's how you represent your people, then it's turned against you.  It's turned against you, yeah.  When you campaign next.  What's the best for the people is not always good for the politician that's doing what's best for the people because they'll turn it around and make you look like a bad guy for voting against your party. 
[00:33:00]  So then these politicians have to figure out how to combat that.  Yeah.  In a campaign somehow.  A big thing that's up on that subject now is the fact that President Obama is using the sequester to alienate people from the Republican Party.  And instead of solving the problem, people are saying that he wants to continue this, not solve the problem until the midterm elections because then it's like if we get Democrats in here and I'm a Democratic president, we could solve this tomorrow by putting his policies in place. 
[00:33:30]  But as long as Republicans are in there, they're just going to stretch this out.  Meanwhile, the sequester is literally 3% of the national budget.  They cut 3% of the budget.  You mean to tell me the American government cannot cut 3% of the budget without losing your meat inspection and your airport security and all this other shit that they're scaring people of? 
[00:34:00]  3% of the fucking budget.  It's disgusting.  Stop.  It's disgusting.  You should be able to cut fucking 10% of it without batting an eye.  And when does the government run out of money?  Oh, who knows?  No, no, no.  It hit yesterday.  Oh, technically?  The end of the month or something.  Yeah, yeah.  The government runs out of money?  It's like, how?  That shouldn't...  Look, man, I know it's like politics 101. 
[00:34:30]  I understand.  But the government should never run out of money.  It's...  The amount of money they bring in.  It's money on paper.  Yeah.  From us bozos.  You know, there's no reason to not have people in certain places that need to be there.  No security.  If he says, I can't deploy a carrier group to a certain region in the globe because we're  out of money.  Right.  No.  You gas it up and you chug it on over there.  Exactly.  And you figure out what the fuck to do about the money later. 
[00:35:00]  It's being...  This whole sequester thing is being used, and I'll say, by both sides.  To make the other side look bad.  I'm a big fan of when you add both sides.  Yeah.  Huge fan of that.  Because, again, it's all political, and it's one party wanting to make the other party look  bad so they get more people in their jobs next election.  And that...  Is that good for...  You know, then...  Is that representing us?  Fuckers. 
[00:35:30]  Here's more Rand Paul.  What we're looking for from, you know, the lead legal officer of the president and from  the president is something a little more precise than I don't intend to, or a little more precise  than, you know, it's not appropriate.  We would like them to say that they don't have a legal authority to kill Americans on American  soil.  We just don't believe they do.  Targeted drone strikes in America, I don't think that they have the legal authority nor 
[00:36:00]  the constitutional prerogative to do this, and they just need to admit to that.  But it's been like pulling teeth getting information or getting them to acknowledge anything, and that's  what our goal is.  Our goal is to try to get the president to acknowledge something publicly.  Just say.  Just say what the legal ramifications are, not your policy, not what it is ethically, not  that...  They always camouflage it with some fucking semantics and bullshit when he's just asking  a question. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, hey, Attorney General Holder, is it legal for you to use a drone to kill an American  citizen on American soil?  There.  Yes or no?  Is it?  Well, there seems to be a thought process in the White House that we should...  Fuck it, what?  Could you imagine going to work down in Washington every day, how fucking frustrating that would  be?  Just exhausting.  You think they don't get anything done around here?  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Holy fuck.  That's amazing.  Oh, it really is.  It's amazing that that goes on and we allow it to go on.  We allow it.  We allow it.  There's so many uninformed people out there.  Then you get someone like Rand Paul that's being honest and saying, you know, nothing  gets done and I don't think anything will get done.  And that's being honest and that should be what people think and get pissed about.  Right.  All right.  They're supposed to be working for us.  When you look at when the president and vice president and secretary of state and everybody  throws the press out of a meeting and says, no, we don't want this, we don't want the public 
[00:37:30]  to hear this.  Fuck you.  Right.  I mean, they've skirted around it with national security things in the past.  Well, you know, we need because we have national security.  But there are just policy issues that they are not allowing people to fucking know about.  Uh, how do they get away with that?  They work for us.  There are representatives, yet they're telling us we aren't allowed to hear what the fuck 
[00:38:00]  they're saying.  You know what drones will eventually be used for?  Because there's future Jimmy.  I love future Jimmy.  You talked about the cameras on the, on the corners and you're right.  Everybody freaked out at one point.  But now we just, we don't even care.  Well, we have a decade with it and it's like, okay, what has it so far?  Where, where are we?  And as far as I know, regular American citizens, it hasn't affected us, but it has been used  in missing child abductions or like when they, when someone is like a random shooting on the  street they have on a camera or somebody walking away from a, it's been used to catch a lot 
[00:38:30]  of bad fucking people doing bad shit, but I don't think that it's been used a lot to target  regular people or it's been a problem.  I'm sure it's been used in, uh, locations, divorce cases.  Yeah.  No, but I mean like a decade later we look back and go, okay, the majority of what it's  been used for, it did not get to this Orwellian crazy place we thought it would.  And once they figure out how to fucking, let's say you could take a drone and, and just target 
[00:39:00]  somebody and you could shoot them with something that doesn't kill them, like a, a stun.  Eventually they'll use it for that just to subdue them to the 10th floor so the cops don't  have to run up the stairwell and risk getting shot.  Or you can, you can mark them with something.  You fucking shoot a pellet into somebody and, uh, you follow them electronically and then,  then you can grab them when they're on the ground.  There's going to be other solutions besides killing somebody with a drone.  Once they figure out how to get something besides bullets out of it, little things that shoot  in that are not deadly that they can use to get you.  Ooh, I love Jimmy's, uh, view of the future. 
[00:39:30]  It's crazy.  That's not that crazy.  There's drones flying around, shooting people.  We're just, we're not laughing or crying.  We're, we're fucking, there's a lot of logic there.  We're talking to each other without our mouths opening.  They'll be using the drones to fucking do police work because the same as like this Connecticut  shooting sparks this weird, crazy outrage, which I get.  But somebody's, something else is going to happen with a cop where a couple of cops can  get killed on duty and some unnecessary bullshit and people are going to be like, enough. 
[00:40:00]  We've had enough of cops who are just really doing the public good being fucking gunned  down.  So we need this for their, you know, that's how everything gets pushed through.  Some national tragedy.  Yeah.  It's always some big thing that gets, uh, I don't know that this, there's got to be more  of fucking government accountability.  Oh yeah.  I don't want them just killing people.  And of course not.  And people are just fucking sheep.  Like not even to, and I'm not saying I'm a Mr.  Fucking, you know, on, on, on my horse with a sword yelling charge, but at least know what's 
[00:40:30]  going on.  At least don't try to fucking fool yourself that there isn't bad stuff going on.  It's a gatekeeper.  And we're not being treated like, um, like we're the ones that have to be accountable  to the government.  We're not, but, but that people actually believe that there are people years ago.  No one believed that you were the one that was accountable to the government. 
[00:41:00]  It was always, Hey, they, they're working for, for us.  They're supposed to be representing us.  Uh, and now I don't think most people even understand that's really the concept here.  They think that, well, they said it, so we do it.  That's how it works.  Uh, pay attention to what, what Chris Rock said, that fucking dumb ass thing about, uh,  you know, Obama's like, uh, your dad.  You listen to your dad, uh, you know, don't, and I don't even think, I don't know how funny  he was trying to be.  Um, but that seems to be the mentality. 
[00:41:30]  Listen to your dad.  Listen to the fucking politicians that are telling you things.  Fuck you.  You listen to me, motherfucker.  I will never listen to a president.  Man.  Yeah, right.  Unfortunately, we're, we're past the point where that's even doable, but at least know  that that's going on people.  You know what?  More importantly, let's get back to the comedy because you had Mark Rubio.  Now, how did Mark Rubio get involved with the filibuster?  Rand Paul needed to take, take a little break.  And this was, uh, in the official rules. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, he was having his, uh, his buddies, you know, he said, without resigning the floor.  Right.  And then there was, there was a handful throughout the time, you know, of other senators.  Was this some kind of gray area though?  Was this, uh, official filibustering?  It was still official filibustering because he wasn't giving up the floor.  Right.  Did he step away from the podium and they came up?  No, they were at a different podium.  Oh, so he has to, it's just purely to keep him from having to talk as much.  Exactly.  It's helping him out, like, talk-wise.  Now, you're filibustering for 13 hours.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  I would absolutely, uh, pee in my pants.  Yeah.  Without a depends, by the way.  I don't care.  Duties.  I'd do that after 40 minutes.  Yeah, because people are, Jimmy just pisses after 40 minutes and shits.  I would awkwardly walk off the floor with, like, uh, piss stains.  Definitely.  Yeah.  And I think I might do a number two on my pants if I'm filibustering.  Oh, a number two.  But the thing that would officially get me would be the, uh, the 13 hours on my feet.  Yeah.  Unless I was, uh, wearing my Herman Munster, uh, shoes. 
[00:43:00]  Or my new invention.  You got, uh, what?  I have a fucking, it's, it's a hiney seat, uh, chair extension.  It's a cushion that you wear on your hiney.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  And a long, like, bar stool-like leg comes out.  Oh, that rocks.  And, uh, through your pants.  You have a zipper in the back of your pants.  Jimmy uses it upside down.  And then it fucking, it has a flat bottom.  Yeah.  And a long, like, tube.  And then you can just kind of stand.  And that tube would, the tube would rest on your balls, right?  No, no.  It goes against the bottom.  Oh, that's too bad.  Almost like a, a flat cushion against your hiney. 
[00:43:30]  It's like a monopod seat.  Right.  Could you, could you stand for 13 hours?  That'd be rough.  In one spot without, you know, without being able to take a little walk around.  They recalled my Herman Munster shoes.  Those were great for fucking standing.  Why'd they recall them?  People were hurting them.  But those ones that rocked back and forth.  Ah, they rolled when you had to, like, stand around.  Why'd they take them back?  Recall them.  I don't know.  They're fucking up people's backs or something.  The ones that are supposed to get you in shape just by walking around.  Yeah, I didn't, I didn't get them to get in shape. 
[00:44:00]  I, it just, it was, it was nice to rock a little bit.  You know how many fat people probably hurt their ankles in those shoes?  Yeah.  I know.  Grabbing them.  I know one fat person that was wearing them for a while.  No.  I don't know.  E-Rock went with the, the only reason I said E-Rock, E-Rock, because Sam looked at you.  You were in the shape-ups, right?  You did the shape-ups?  I had them, yeah.  Did you like them?  No.  I loved them.  They looked horrendous, though.  They looked so stupid.  They were flat when he was done with them. 
[00:44:30]  They are like some kind of a, yeah.  Is there a tottery hat?  Why'd they get recalled?  There's no real heel on them.  The middle is like, yeah, like a, like a, like a bottom of a rocking chair almost.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like they were supposed to rock on them.  You can't really lean back on, you could lean back on your heel, I guess.  Yeah.  But it keeps you just kind of rocking in the middle of the shoe.  Mm-hmm.  It was nice when you had to stand around, or like, or if I walked around Manhattan a lot,  it was nice.  Yeah.  But they looked so stupid.  Uh, so, uh, Mark Rubio helped him out? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He jumped on, but he was just fighting.  Like, he only had to talk for, whatever, 15, 20 minutes.  Mm-hmm.  And even in his time up there, you would think, the, the, the weirdness that was coming out  of his mouth, you would think he was the one who was filibustering.  Oh, he couldn't even come up with like 15 minutes of good material?  He started quoting just the weirdest shit.  But shouldn't somebody go, all right, this is nonsense now.  Yeah.  If you're filibustering, you gotta have something of substance.  You can't be, what was he doing?  He was, uh, quoting Wiz Khalifa? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, he started, that was his first.  He got up there and he said, if I can quote Wiz Khalifa.  I have no idea who Wiz Khalifa is.  Yeah, I met him outside.  Do you got a picture with him?  Of course I did, yeah.  We're a couple of celebrities.  What's his big song?  Um, he's had a couple hits.  Give me a hit.  I mean, I know the hits, but play it for these guys.  For the audience.  Yeah, please.  I'm all about Wiz Khalifa.  I think if somebody would have said to him, you know, hey, this is nonsense, that gives  him an opportunity to talk about why it's not nonsense.  So they just, it's a relief. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because Mark Rubio, who's this close to being the president, some would say, is up there  quoting Wiz Khalifa.  Yeah.  I think he also quoted Jay-Z or something, didn't he?  And the Godfather.  We got the clips.  Really?  Yeah, we're going to play him in the second.  This is probably his biggest single.  Because this is like also, oh, I recognize this song.  Is this a song about being in the club?  No, but it's probably mentioned.  It's got big when the Steelers, I think, were in the Super Bowl.  Yeah, I remember this one.  Do you? 
[00:46:30]  Rap songs have just gotten silly.  It is always about being in the club.  I've got some, I've got some, what happened?  There's a bunch of honeys.  I'm drinking.  I've got a gold hat there.  I've got a shot of crystal.  I've got a big car.  Drive home.  Really?  Can you do anything else?  That life seems exhausting.  Oh, enough with the club.  Holy shit.  You've got to hear a train of thought, James.  Got some bubs.  Is it bubs or bubblies?  I mean, it was in like 2003. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, fuck.  It's taken a turn for the absurd, though.  Oh, and what does this have to do with Fandango?  Fandango.  You guys have been practicing.  You've got to say it right.  He's not going to debut.  I'm so mad I might be into a wrestling storyline.  Stupid work.  I'm really mad.  It's a funny angle.  If I'm going to go to WrestleMania, I've got to kind of know what's going on.  Are you going to go?  I think I'm going to go.  Where is WrestleMania?  Right here.  It's here now.  Giant Stadium.  It's Giant Stadium, so.  Outdoors?  Yes.  Yeah.  In a month?  Is it the first time it's outdoors, but it's the first time it's been outdoors in cold 
[00:47:30]  weather.  What's the date?  The date's like April.  April 7th.  It's not going to be that cold.  It's a Sunday.  It might not be that bad.  Yeah, it's always on a Sunday.  We're all going, right?  I think we should go field trip.  I'm your plus one, Sam.  Don't fuck me.  I got two tickets, but if Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  E-Rock, will you be my plus four?  Oh, E-Rock.  He just shakes his head.  E-Rock, I promise I'll drive you home this time. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, boy.  I promise.  From Giant Stadium.  I promise.  I promise.  Jim, do you want to go to WrestleMania?  I actually would like.  Is CM Punk wrestling?  He's wrestling The Undertaker.  It's one of the major, major matches.  Yes, I do want to go to WrestleMania.  A lot of celebrities go to WrestleMania.  I've never been to a WrestleMania.  Are we going to be where the celebrities are?  I'll work out some good tickets for you guys.  You know what I could do?  What are you talking about?  I'm your plus one.  I'm sitting where you are.  I mean, I'm looking at friends and family box.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a good box to be in.  I could stay out in the car in the parking lot and just send the drone right over the 
[00:48:30]  fucking rim of the stadium, right down into the fucking thing and take a look that  way.  Unless it's been outlawed by then.  Maybe.  Dude, please do that before they outlaw.  Fuck, would that be hilarious?  How much trouble could you possibly get in?  Oh, my God, there's a drone over the ring.  A drone just hit Miz.  So CM Punk is wrestling The Undertaker.  Is that the headline of that?  It's one of the...  It's probably behind Cena and The Rock.  It's the biggest match on the card.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I think The Rock's the number one, obviously. 
[00:49:00]  We've got to go number one for The Rock.  I'd probably leave right before that match just to beat Traffic.  Oh, God, is The Rock going to cook again?  Well, I've eaten enough.  I don't think so.  All right, Rubio, quoting weird stuff.  What does CCM Punk wrestle?  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Yeah.  Make sure you get us really good seats.  Oh, this fucking chick intern that...  We are going to talk about this chick intern next.  Not her.  It's the chick intern that got killed was really...  Was she hot?  Yeah, it looks like she might have been hot.  Look, man.  California. 
[00:49:30]  Let's all be honest with each other.  When the person is hot, it hurts a little.  A little bit.  Even though you don't know him.  Look, but...  I don't know.  I saw something like that.  Is that her right there?  Yeah.  A lot, yeah.  Oh, boy, did she get eaten.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that sometime.  At least she didn't get kicked in the balls.  They better not kill the fucking lion.  They didn't kill the lion, right?  No, but apparently what I'm hearing is the lion is no longer able to talk to the interns.  They've got to go through the monkey.  Ah, gotcha.  So it's a very different situation. 
[00:50:00]  No, you know what it is?  They sank in the bald ostrich.  And it just kind of bumbled around and put its head in the sand.  And they're like...  I don't mean that.  I'm sorry.  I actually ran away from the radio wizard the other day.  Oh, dude.  My first day back, I ran away from him.  I can't take his weird glasses.  Is that what's doing it now?  Yes.  The glasses, yeah.  What kind of glasses are those?  He was trying to talk to you yesterday, you know?  Yeah.  And you got in the elevator.  Yeah.  You said, I'm coming right back up. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Was he waiting for me?  You came up, but then you went immediately back downstairs.  And yeah, he was waiting for you.  And he asked me if you were back upstairs.  And I said, you had already exited.  I don't feel good, man.  Give me a few more days.  I want to see him in those glasses doing like a really weird wavy, groovy dance.  Wavy, groovy dance?  Like, just with his hands kind of crisscrossing, like waves in front of him.  Yeah.  With like late 60s music playing.  I don't know.  I just wanted to see that.  Oh, like a little Austin Powers? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Your rock was on it.  Oh, this would be great.  Yeah.  Okay.  And what is he doing with his hands?  He's just kind of like waving them in front of them doing a groovy dance.  Like this?  Yeah.  With the glasses on?  Yeah, really embarrassing and a bad wave.  No one has been able to properly describe these glasses for the radio audience.  They are so weird.  Yeah.  They're like octogods or something.  Okay, here's what his glasses look like.  Yeah.  When Mo Green got shot in the eye, that's what Gary is wearing. 
[00:51:30]  He's wearing Mo Green's glasses.  Yeah, he's got those groovy hipster glasses.  Yeah, but there is a lot of sides to them.  Yeah.  A lot of sharp angles.  And the rims are thick.  Yeah.  But the handles, and they're dark.  Yeah.  But the handles are green.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's so much going on with his glasses.  It really went all out. 
[00:52:00]  It made me uncomfortable and I ran away the other day.  That's what it was?  Yes.  Because I know why.  Because I'm trying to be nicer and I know I'm going to openly laugh at them.  Well, it doesn't work if you say it.  That's my bits.  Haven't you figured it out yet?  All right, so you got Mark Rubio.  Could be the president.  There he is quoting Wiz Khalifa.  Yeah, this is how he follows up his big I need a glass of water thing.  Yeah.  Oh, the water.  Yeah, Watergate. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  During Rand Paul's 13-hour filibuster.  I would, without yielding the floor, like to entertain a question from the senator from  Florida.  Mr. President.  Thank you.  First of all, let me congratulate the junior senator from Texas on a fantastic question.  In that question, he used Shakespeare references.  He used a reference to the movie Patton, one of the great movies.  I didn't bring my Shakespeare book. 
[00:53:00]  So let me just begin by quoting a modern-day poet.  His name is Wiz Khalifa.  He has a song called Work Hard, Play Hard.  What's the name of that?  They're laughing.  I think, if you look at the time, I think it's a time when many of our colleagues expected  to be home, back in the home state, playing hard.  But I'm happy that we're here still working hard on this issue.  Wow.  Wiz.  What a weird thing.  Wiz Khalifa.  And then he went on to quote The Godfather.  I actually go to a movie, one of the great American movies, The Godfather. 
[00:53:30]  There's a quote in that movie.  I don't have the patent quotes, but I have The Godfather quotes.  This is one of the best-known ones.  It says, I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.  To me, these are offers he can't refuse.  Straightforward offers you can't refuse, and yet they've been refused.  And I think that's pretty stunning.  He realized he fucked up refuse.  Oh, exactly.  Refuse, refuse.  So he's going to say it a few more times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  An offer they can't refuse.  Inconspicuous, by the way. 
[00:54:00]  I do know that word.  What did you say yesterday?  It was so weird, I don't even know.  Oh, my God.  No, I don't know.  Was it inconspicuous?  Unconspicuous should be a word.  I think it was inconspicuous.  I don't know.  I know it's inconspicuous.  I really do.  I don't remember what it was, though, yeah.  It was a bad one yesterday.  I have a few every once in a while.  Inspicious?  Yeah.  Inspicious.  I don't know.  Uh, and then Rubio quotes Jay-Z, Anthony.  Oh, good. 
[00:54:30]  Thank God.  Which song?  Hard Knock Life?  No.  99 Problems with the Pitching One?  It was, it was what they call, well, somewhat of a deep track, actually.  Nah, I don't like the deep tracks of Jay-Z.  It's a great song.  I don't understand him.  The third thing I want to say is, I want you to imagine what this conversation would  be like tonight if the president was George W. Bush.  And if this issue was about George W. Bush, just imagine that for a moment now.  If he had been asked this direct question and had refused to answer, what this chamber 
[00:55:00]  would look like tonight, what the arguments being made would be like tonight.  Just imagine that for a moment.  That takes me back to another modern-day poet by the name of Jay-Z in one of the songs he  wrote.  It's funny what seven days can change.  It was all good just a week ago.  Well, I don't know if it was all good a week ago, but I can tell you that things have really  changed.  Because if the president was George W. Bush and this was a question being asked of him  and his response was the silence we've gotten, we'd have a very different scenario here tonight. 
[00:55:30]  That is true.  Yep.  That is true.  And the media would be all over it, too.  Meanwhile, virtual impunity on the part of, for the president.  When you don't answer questions, a yes or no question to the attorney general or anybody,  there should be some kind of penalty for that.  Oh, yeah.  Because, of course, there never will be.  A noogie kind of penalty?  Indian wrist burn?  Or some type of, maybe they take all the pens out of your office.  Ooh.  What about a pink belly?  Brutal. 
[00:56:00]  Pink belly?  Pink belly.  You like that good pink belly?  Frap, flap, flap, flap, flap.  That scarred me mentally as a kid seeing guys get pink belly.  Horrifying me.  The helplessness of that, yeah.  Pink bellies were horrible.  Geez.  Or horrendous.  Yeah, they sucked.  Ow.  This is before bullying, Sam.  You're from that generation.  Yeah, it was just called growing up.  We used to fucking beat the shit out of each other.  Right.  My uncle pink bellied me in a lobby in a hotel in Kentucky once.  It was horrible.  Pink sucked you, too?  And he fucking white bellied you.  You said the Indian burn, too, right? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  The Indian burn was really bad.  That one was not fun.  What was the other one?  There was a...  Yeah.  You ever play that slap game?  Wedgie.  Wedgies.  What was this game called?  The slap game.  Where you put your hands out.  Yeah?  What do you do?  No, not the fake vagina thing.  I know that one.  You put your hands out like this in front of you.  Yeah.  And then the other guy had to have his hands behind his back, and if you flinched, you got  a free shot.  You never played that game.  What's the object? 
[00:57:00]  To smack his hand?  Yeah.  And then you have to try to move out of the way.  And if you move out of the way, then it's your turn.  But if you flinched, then the other guy gets a free shot.  Free smack?  You never played that one?  No.  I was a flinchy little fucker.  I'd have lost.  Yeah.  That wasn't fun either.  Rand Paul ends the filibuster here.  He finally went back to the...  Thank you.  Good night.  He finally went back to talking.  Threw the mic on the floor.  Walked out.  See ya.  I would like to thank the members of Congress whose ability to impact the President's decision. 
[00:57:30]  And one, we'll say that the Senate should be trying to restrain the executive branch,  Republican or Democrat.  And two, we'll use your influence to try to tell the President to do what I think really  is in his heart, and that is to say, absolutely, we're not going to be killing Americans not  in a combat situation, that we will obey the Constitution.  That the Fifth Amendment does apply to all Americans, and there aren't exceptions.  But I thank you very much for the forbearance, and I yield the floor. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, there he goes.  Senator from Illinois.  Who the fuck sat through all that?  Did anybody actually sit through all that?  Wait, did anybody actually have to sit there through all that?  I bet they came and went.  Yeah, he's still talking.  All right.  This guy wants to comment about something you said, Anne, I think.  James in North Carolina. 
[00:58:30]  James.  Yeah, good morning.  First off, I've got to say, Ram's daddy's got to be pretty proud of him there.  I think he is, yeah.  Secondly, Anne, you touched on a very critical or important fact.  When you stated that we are not beholden to the government,  you also, something I would like to say that's critical to you and Opie and Jimmy,  you guys realize that you are in the biggest city under communism at the moment. 
[00:59:00]  Little New York City, right?  Well, let's put it this way.  You know how Obama is trying to put executive orders on gun control  and that directly affects you, Anne?  Right, yeah.  You do not have to comply with that, period,  because executive orders are only for federal employees.  You can look it up.  Well, I can look it up, and then you get that other argument about,  well, you know, you don't have to pay taxes, and then you go to jail anyway. 
[00:59:30]  So we have to comply.  Well, I would think that, you know, the mayor of McBitch up there would be a bigger concern for you guys,  because you guys are also under the third largest army.  She's got the third largest army in the nation.  I guess that's what, the NYPD?  Well, the NYPD, the SWAT, the, what do you call it, grenade-proof vehicles and all that. 
[01:00:00]  I like them guys, though.  I'm a friend of the NYPD, so I'm part of that army.  Yep.  I go out there, kick some ass, take some names.  And the FBI, too, now.  What do you do?  Right.  Like the FBI.  When the army turns against you, though.  Nah, I don't see that happening.  Not yet.  Not yet.  I'll wait.  I'll see what happens.  If you're not careful, if you guys are not careful, and you don't watch closely what's going on,  you're going to end up being in the Snake Plissken movie real fast.  Escape from New York.  Yep.  I like that one.  Yep. 
[01:00:30]  So that's what I'm...  All right, James.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  We're on the front lines here in New York.  We'll take care of it before it reaches North Carolina.  Okay.  All right, James.  Thank you.  There's a bunch of people out there.  There's a lot of people out there in the U.S.  We're going to talk about lions next.  Liars?  I better tell the truth.  Lions.  Oh, fuck.  You stepped on me, cucksucker.  You knew I was going to say that.  Chip, I'm sorry.  I fucking told you that in the parking lot. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, I'm sorry, Chip.  Cucksucker.  The Okinawa Show.  This is the Okinawa Show.  I sure hope you can repurpose this.  Are you going to repurpose a repurposed bit?  Or us discussing repurpose?  That would be some weird Matrix shit.  I'm purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Nice.  Purposed. 
[01:01:30]  Repurposed.  Nice.  What does that mean?  A new purpose?  But a repurposed means you're purposing it again.  A repurpose has a new purpose to what?  Originally had a different purpose.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Wait.  All right.  Let's break it down.  Re-use.  Re-use.  So you use something, and then you reuse it. 
[01:02:00]  So it's not a new purpose.  You're using it for the same shit.  Purpose is sounding weird now.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  Let's take an audio that at one point had a purpose, and adding a new purpose to the same audio.  Now we're repurposing that same audio as to be a song. 
[01:02:30]  Well, there you go.  There's the repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose bit.  Repurpose bit.  Repurpose bit.  The kids are running wild, because school's out, but cool's in.  No reason to get antsy.  Yeah, where are you getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Gym.  Oh my God.  California is trendsetting again, with all the coolest slang and wackiest situations.  That is so grody.  Hey Jim, did you like, hear that Sheila was totes making out with Brad? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, make me want to barf.  Tag along, as the crew lives, laughs, but also learns.  Uh, like, oh my God.  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen of the valley, and in the valley, we don't take guff.  Well, maybe you can't hear this.  Oops, turn it up.  Middle finger time.  Like, that's my grandmother. 
[01:03:30]  Oh my God, you're so old, you should call dirt by name or something.  And a special appearance by President Ronald Reagan.  Yes, hello, well, whatever, you're, uh, grody, yes, gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Gym, coming very soon to a theater near you.  Well, how am I supposed to talk, like, with my butt or something?  News of the world, Opie and Anthony, Hollywood radio show to the stars. 
[01:04:00]  Silver screen heavy hitter Donald Sutherland was on the Opie and Anthony show and had a ball.  Jesus, this is the most depressing show.  I feel totally alienated.  And you actually have listeners.  Mr. Movie Magic Donald Sutherland told all.  He was more starstruck by both the Opie and Anthony fellas than they of him.  When I came in here, I was terrified.  Absolutely terrified.  Who booked me into this show?  Donald, Donald, before you leave us, tell us, please.  Did you have fun with Opie and Anthony? 
[01:04:30]  Did I have fun here?  Oh, I'm so happy it's finished.  Stay tuned as News of the World continues to take an inside look at the lives of silver screen studs and starlets  on Opie and Anthony, Hollywood radio show to the stars.  Coming this fall, Daytime TV is back with a bite.  Hell yeah.  Spend your weekday afternoons laughing, loving, and learning with Mike.  I'm not going to say anything about the vagina. 
[01:05:00]  Heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, leaves the ring behind and hosts his own daytime TV show, giving dating advice.  That's how it is.  Everybody know.  You stick with your ex even though you break up till you find somebody whose sex is better or just as good.  Sharing personal experiences.  Don Keenan, give me my Padim.  I couldn't eat, motherfucker.  I'm going to beat you a grown man.  I ain't eat, motherfucker.  Fuck you, nigga.  And getting a little rowdy with the studio audience.  Fuck you!  Fuckin' do it!  Yeah!  Mike lets the audience in on his more reserved, well-read side. 
[01:05:30]  Yes, sir.  My diction's too precarious for your comprehension.  I will endeavor to exclaminate more profoundly.  Yes, ma'am.  But he isn't afraid to let loose now and then, too.  Booga, booga, booga!  Booga, booga!  Weekday afternoons this fall.  It's Mike.  Woo!  Hosted by Mike Tyson.  What do you say, champ?  What do you...  The Opie and Anthony Network brings you the hottest new primetime dating game show.  Presenting Unmatchables, where two completely incompatible people are locked in a room and 
[01:06:00]  forced to make awkward conversations.  How old are you to say that?  I'm almost 30.  You're almost 30?  Well, you look very good.  You look very pretty.  Watch the season premiere as Australian comedian and drunkard Jim Jeffries attempts to seduce  American adult starlet Justine Jolie.  Hey, you'll learn to love me.  Over time, you will love me.  Will Justine be impressed by Jim's plush living arrangement?  I have a studio flat in L.A. which has a pungent smell that I can't find, but I'm going  to endeavor to find that, and then you'll get quite the raping. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  That was a joke.  Come on.  That was funny.  Look, I've got a little accent.  Will Jim be able to woo Justine with his thoughts of romance?  I don't like kissing girls, right?  I used to like kissing girls when I was like 14 or 15, but then after I got my dick sucked,  I was over kissing.  Kissing is now a dead zone for me.  That's really unfortunate, because that's one of the main things that I really enjoy  about a man.  Or his thoughts on making love.  I'd rather have a threesome that involves a guy and a girl, because I like seeing the  cock going into her mouth as I'm fucking her. 
[01:07:00]  I just like seeing a girl being degraded.  Yeah.  Oh, degraded.  Oh, oh.  He stopped himself before he said it.  I said degraded, you slut.  Can Jim Jeffries turn it all around?  I love you.  And I mean that.  I love you.  I've never been in love before.  Probably not.  I would eat your poo.  That's a good thing, Jim.  It's not a good thing for you.  Nobody would be hilarious to fucking watch.  I'm going to dig it out with a knife.  Find out just how incompatible these two are.  Why does she hate me so much?  I don't hate you.

All right, let me go to Jeff in Columbus.  Uh, Jeff.  Hey, you boys.  Love the show.  That's what they, Jimmy.  Right with the fucking...  Dude, how many times do we have to hear that?  For real?  Okay.  Go ahead.  What?  I was wondering if the guy had enough wits about him to hit the general e-horn before 
[01:08:00]  he hit the concrete support show.  This is why we hate the fucking callers, man.  It's like one fucking bad joke after another.  Hey, Bob Kelly.  Why don't you get some cancer and die?  Dude, it's me you're talking to.  And don't try to incorporate the fucking lingo of the show.  It's annoying.  Hey, did you wake up on the wrong side of the fact that...  No, I didn't.  I'm just sick and tired of guys like you wrecking the fucking show.  We got a flow going.  Why'd you put me through?  I didn't put you through.  You fucking happy, Bert, that we get it. 
[01:08:30]  It's the same fucking joke.  Time and time again.  Well, then...  Call up and make your fucking point.  To you.  Fucking asshole.  That it?  Hey, dude.  You're the one that called up and fucking wrecked what was going on.  Anything else?  Cut your fucking losses, dude.  Just fucking go.  Get killed.  That was certainly unnecessary, wasn't it? 
[01:09:00]  Stay tuned for more unnecessary cruelty on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Series A.  Series A.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Work card.  Play art.  Work.  Work.  Work.

[01:09:30]  Get my money insane, nigga.  That's a real powerful word.  It's very powerful.  This is good.  Play this for as long as the filibuster you might reach as many times as I say it.  See?  Because I say it a lot.  Thank you.  Ooh, our blueberries have arrived.  Oh, well.  I went to our supermarket last night, Jimmy, looking for blueberries.  They were all mushy.  Yeah, the blueberries are in the supermarket.  Oh, man, do I get pissed.  I open up the blueberry containers and I squeeze them to see if they're... 
[01:10:00]  Oh, boy.  If they're...  People like that?  I'm sure.  That's why they say you've got to wash your fruit.  People are fucking squeezing fruit all over the place.  God, it's terrible.  You don't like fruit, do you?  I love a good grape.  Melon.  I like a good grape.  I like kiwis.  You can't just say a good grape.  What makes a good grape?  Obviously, no seeds.  No seeds.  Start there.  Red or green.  I like your green grape.  Okay.  Got to be good and ripe, though. 
[01:10:30]  And...  A little crunch.  A little crunch to it.  Not too much crunch, because then it's a little sour.  Not mushy.  It falls into that perfect category.  When you find a good batch of grapes, there's nothing better.  Nice and speed.  But, man, that makes my duty flow.  Does it?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  A couple hours later.  Yeah.  Like a fucking mudslide.  I'll wreak havoc on you.  Oh, I do like a good ripe honeydew melon.  No.  Those are great.  I don't believe in this. 
[01:11:00]  They exist.  Melon, watermelon.  Watermelon's good.  No.  Fucking cantaloupe when it's ripe is good.  It's so hard to get them, like, ripe, though, because if you buy, like, an assorted fruit  little bowl thing, it's fucking like a rock.  They're all hardened and have no flavor to them.  Yes.  Terrible.  But when they're sweet and, like, fucking ripe, it's great.  I like a kiwi.  I like a good kiwi.  You like a good fruit salad?  I like a good fruit salad, as long as there's no citrus in it. 
[01:11:30]  You can't put citrus in a fruit salad.  It overpowers the whole damn thing.  Here's the problem with fruit salads.  Yeah.  You gotta make it fresh, and you gotta eat it within 20 minutes.  20 minutes.  Yes.  Within a half hour.  I don't know what fucking happens.  But it's shitty.  See, I make a fruit salad, and I put it, like, on a...  Like, on a plate.  Yeah.  And I'll just leave it under the sofa for a few hours.  That's a good place to leave it.  And some good ripe pineapple is good, too.  Love the pineapple.  It's acidic, so you can't, like, completely binge on it. 
[01:12:00]  But it's good to have in there.  Sure.  I like that.  I like your raspberries, and I like your, um...  Blackberries.  What else?  Blackberries.  You don't like blackberries.  I do.  But I will tell you something.  I despise the insidious blueberry.  Really?  Wow.  The blueberry is destroying our country.  Because you don't...  I don't like a blueberry.  You don't understand how to pick a proper blueberry.  No.  Even good, ripe blueberries.  I don't like the taste of them.  Cloudy and firm. 
[01:12:30]  Don't enjoy it.  I found a good one.  You won't?  No.  I will never eat a blueberry.  I'll never eat a blueberry again.  Uh-oh.  Those are deceiving there.  No cloudy ones had been sent.  These aren't that good.  Not that good.  Uh-oh.  Not that good.  Man.  But as far as massive fruits to eat, grapes, I think, are...  What about strawberries?  Love a good fucking strawberry.  I love the strawberries.  They are good.  You gotta cut the middles out, though. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Cut the middles out.  No, I just grab it by that fucking green leafy shit and bite a little so you don't get  to it.  And you have to toss that away.  You hollow out the middle of a strawberry a little bit.  Yeah.  That's the flavor, sir.  Really?  Because it's bitter on there?  You're welcome.  Just a little bit.  You carve it out a little bit.  My dad used to chop that shit up and make sugar water.  What?  What?  It would be...  The strawberries would be all chopped up nice, right?  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  And there would be the natural water because you washed your fruit before you cut it.  And then he would add just a little more water.  And then he would put a couple scoops of sugar on top.  What would that do?  It's beyond amazing.  Really?  It's not as healthy as just eating strawberries.  Well, no.  That sounds like something they make in fucking the Good Times Projects.  Get some sugar water flow to hot out.  Sugar water.  Good times.  You had to make up shit when you were poor.  Yeah.  We did a lot with sugar. 
[01:14:00]  It kept the kids happy, huh?  I would...  A little happiness for the kids.  We didn't have a lot of treats in our house.  So every once in a while, man, I would just dip into the bag of sugar for my sugar rush.  You would just, like, grab...  I swear to God, a spoon and I would go in for a couple scoops.  I gotta agree with that, though.  I've been known as a kid to grab a tablespoon of sugar.  Yeah, because we didn't have any real fucking treats around the house.  And it's all weird when it's in your mouth at first.  You're like...  Right.  All dusty.  And I know we talked about it, but cooking chocolate? 
[01:14:30]  Mm.  Yeah, the bitter...  I would go into the cupboard desperately looking for something sweet.  Yeah.  And I would see that chocolate, knowing it was bitter shit.  Yeah, you knew it.  And I still would go, no, I don't...  I think this time it's not going to be bitter shit.  Because it looked like fucking chocolate.  It's great.  And then I would...  I knew before.  Yeah.  But I still had to try.  I go, no, I think it might taste good this time.  People are going to get mad at me because I'm going to eat a little.  Oh, go ahead.  That looks good.  God, does that look good.  That's a...  It's an onion bagel. 
[01:15:00]  Onion bagel.  Okay.  You said...  Okay.  Got just a couple slides of ham on it...  Okay.  ...with melted American.  God.  That smells fucking good.  Let's go get some bacon right now.  Yeah.  Oh, is that goddamn good?  That leads to bacon, I think.  Yeah, it kind of does.  A toasted onion bagel smells fucking good, man.  I'm an everything bagel.  Doesn't it?  Everything bagel.  Yeah, I love an everything bagel.  I like a good everything bagel.  Mm-hmm.  I'm all about mixing up all the fucking seeds.  You like all that?  All that.  Mixing seeds?  That's right.  I go everything and then I go raisins. 
[01:15:30]  Raisins like more dessert, though.  True.  Yeah.  You wouldn't make a pizza bagel with a raisin bagel.  No.  Cinnamon raisin bagel.  And then, you know what?  Or a donut.  A good salt bagel.  A salt bagel.  Well, why would that matter what the bagel did?  That's like having a pretzel.  Those of them were, because I don't need them as much.  Amazing.  Oh, fuck.  Salt bagels are a lot like pretzels. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  I like that.  There's nothing.  Every day we walk by these New York City.  I'm trying to get better.  The New York City pretzel smell.  I like a hard pretzel.  I don't like when they're too soft and salty.  I like when they're burned.  Do you?  Yeah.  Oh, I like a good burned New York pretzel.  Jimmy's all about pretzels.  I like a good pretzel.  I like a good pretzel eating.  I don't need more, no.  Get it from the cart.  It tastes fucking great for three steps.  And then the cold winter air hits it. 
[01:16:30]  It turns fucking instantly hard and stale.  It does turn stale, right?  What the fuck?  This guy knows about sugar water.  Does he?  Or it might be a gal.  Ray.  R-A-E.  You got it.  Hi, boy.  You know about sugar water, right?  It's actually called macerating your fruit, and it's a very common technique.  Your dad was way ahead of the time.  Well, he's dead.  Oh.  He's very dead right now.  He's still alive in my mind, though. 
[01:17:00]  Jesus.  Some days I think about him like he's still at the house I grew up in.  You have those creepy dreams?  You know.  Where you hang out with him?  He died right outside our family house.  Oh, boy.  It was fucking brutal.  I can't even ride by the house anymore.  Oh, boy.  She hung up.  Oh, my God.  She hung up.  She couldn't take it.  Do you have those creepy dreams where you hang out with him?  I have those.  I think I talked about it on the show. 
[01:17:30]  I'm not sure, but I go to meditation once a week, and I had one of these weird meditations  where I was just visualizing him like he was still...  Whoa.  But it was bringing me back to, like, moments throughout my whole life with him, all different  ages, and it was beyond real.  You're like in a time machine.  It was like a time machine.  Crazy.  But it was more than if you think about, like, think about your dad right now.  Yeah.  You could think of some, like, memories and things you did.  Yeah.  This was so vivid, so real. 
[01:18:00]  Wow.  So detailed.  Hard to explain, I guess.  Were you half asleep and half awake in that kind of weird zone?  Well, I was meditating.  Yeah.  Which is sort of that...  That's kind of that weird half-asleep zone.  Yeah.  It was cool.  Kind of liked it that day.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That just kicked me in the head about a dream I had last night.  LeBron James?  No.  Oh.  I was hanging out with LeBron James in my dream last night.  And I didn't fuck it up.  Did you fuck it up like you did with the president?  I didn't fuck it up, man.  We were hanging and laughing.  And the whole time I was thinking how I'm going to get a fucking picture with LeBron James 
[01:18:30]  and realized, you know what?  I don't need a picture with LeBron James because we're obviously friends here.  Obviously.  Yeah.  So you didn't fuck it all up.  Well, then I woke up and went, you know what?  I should have gotten a picture.  You're friends with Jimmy and Anthony.  You're not friends with LeBron James.  Oh, man.  It was kind of a letdown.  Back down to earth.  No offense to you guys, but I realized when I woke up that he has no idea who I am.  Back down to earth.  But it reminded you of what?  Oh, I had a dream last night.  I had a bunch of them.  They were all fucking weird. 
[01:19:00]  But there's one part I remember.  I was at some foreign country, some weird, like, Spanish-type land.  Venezuela?  South America.  Yeah, probably because I've been hearing about Venezuela.  Right.  With Hugo Chavez.  And I was at a bar that was like an exotic dancer bar.  So there were these sleazy, kind of, like, Spanish girls dancing.  That's not your type, though.  I know.  Okay, go ahead.  Sorry.  But I was accompanied by Jimmy Norton, who was in the dream with me in this place. 
[01:19:30]  So the protocol at this club was so fucking weird.  Well, the protocol, I mean, because there's usually an amateur there.  Go ahead.  The protocol.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  You.  Yeah, that was awful.  There were girls dancing, yet they were behind these kind of curtains that went out onto the street. 
[01:20:00]  So they were on the street in front of the club dancing.  But there's various curtains where they were behind it.  So we couldn't even really see them.  And then what you did was you had to give them money so you could see them.  Right.  And the way you gave them money, the money was so like nothing compared to American money that you had coffee cans.  There were these coffee cans stuffed with bills.  Like you took hundreds of bills out of your pocket and just shoved in these coffee cans.  And that was like one dollar in their country. 
[01:20:30]  That was like the tip.  But then you had to put it behind a red line on a table in front of the curtain that she was behind in the street.  Yeah.  Put it down, step away, and then she would come in and grab the money.  And that's when you'd see her.  When she just grabbed the money.  You wouldn't see anything else.  Which is ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  So there's this other guy and he's waiting to stuff his coffee can full of money to see this one girl.  But I was already stuffed in the coffee can.  And then a bill fell out so I went to grab it.  And then I was trying to sneak a look at her so I wouldn't put the coffee can down so she could come in and get it. 
[01:21:00]  And then the other guy started getting pissed at me and tried to fight.  Always taking the shortcut, Kumia.  I know.  Well, I put the coffee can down and the girl came around and she grabbed the coffee can.  And I kind of smiled at her and nothing.  Nothing.  She just fucking walks away.  And then this other guy is trying to duke it out with me.  And I call him a fucking asshole and the club security came over and broke us up.  And I look over.  He's now sitting in a booth with Jimmy Norton talking.  Shit.  So I look over and I go, Jimmy, why the fuck are you hanging out with that cunt? 
[01:21:30]  And then the guy goes, calling me a cunt?  And then I was all dejected because Jimmy is now hanging out with the guy that wanted to fight with me in the club.  Yeah.  But the thing was, you were causing a ruckus with the coffee cans.  Yeah.  He was behaving.  And I wanted to see some girls behind the curtains.  All right.  Maybe that was it.  But were you probably handling your coffee can?  Yes, I was.  My coffee can was filled with a lot of newspaper and money on top.  That's the dumbest dream ever.  It was so vivid.  It was cool.  But what goes on in your stupid brain where you're convinced it's real? 
[01:22:00]  I know.  Until you wake up.  How would I not be in that going?  This is ludicrous.  This is the dumbest thing.  But when you're dreaming it, it's reality.  Right.  To you.  No reason for me to.  I woke up convinced I'm friends with LeBron James.  And then what happens?  And I still thought I was friends with him for the first few minutes after that alarm went off.  Yeah.  And then I went, that's dumb.  I'm not friends with LeBron James.  I love when I don't get a picture in a dream and I'm frustrated.  Then I wake up and realize it was only a dream.  And you have a chance.  I've had to go about the president's Beatles recently. 
[01:22:30]  The Beatles.  Like McCartney and someone else.  And I was like, so glad I didn't blow that.  Damn.  And then you're relieved that it was just a dumb dream, right?  Yeah.  So happy.  Fucking coffee can strip club.  Coffee can strip club.  What a dumb thing, too, because I didn't get to see the girl, really.  I could see her through the, like, there were three different curtains hung up.  So I could see kind of between two curtains.  She's out on the street dancing.  Like, why wouldn't I go out on the street and watch her for free instead of having to  stuff the coffee can?  Let's go into business together.  Coffee can strip club.  Coffee can strip club. 
[01:23:00]  No one steal that.  It's going to be a big fucking thing.  Or that could be a band name.  Coffee can strip club.  You're going to go check out coffee can strip club tonight.  Because you felt dirty, Ant?  Really?  No.  Those are those dream people.  You can't analyze that one.  That's got something to do, I bet, with you got to fucking, you know, to get girls, you  got to put out your money and then kind of step back and entice her.  Like, that's what that sounds like.  Like, you have all these great things, but you can't really see the girl. 
[01:23:30]  But to get her to come to you, you take what you have and you put it there and you step back.  Well, I'm thinking that it's the money I need to.  Yeah, but the money could, not that you get hookers, but the money could be the house  or it could be all these possessions or these things.  Oh, man.  All these girls are hidden to you.  But they only make themselves known when you put down what you have.  Oh, well, what the fuck were you doing there?  I'm just a piece of shit who needed a ride to the strip club. 
[01:24:00]  Who talks to my enemies.  Yeah, he was giving me a ride home.  He promised me we'd split a tranny.  Yeah, that was weird.  What's that?  That's just my briefcase.  Oh, I see Dollar Shave Club stuff in there, huh?  By the way.  I'm all about the Dollar Shave Club stuff.  Yeah, I'm going to try it this time.  I'm going to try it.  It's good stuff.  Oh, you're going to try it on your head?  Yeah.  No, yeah, my face.  No, I mean you're...  No, no, no.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  UFC is maybe that dirtbag, dirtbag union whore, Sheldon Silver,  has said that it's probably going to be legalized.  Maybe not.  We don't know when, but this scumbag speaker, Sheldon Silver,  who's been blocking UFC or MMA legalization in New York,  all about unions in Vegas and the fatigas and the property they own.  That's all it's about.  Nothing to do with it being violent.  Of course.  48 states, it's legal.  48 states.  Which two?  New York and what else?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know what the other one is.  I can't believe New York's one of them. 
[01:25:00]  All union shit.  It's union stuff.  It has nothing to do with violence.  Nothing.  It's an ethical question.  Shut up.  Fucking Sheldon Silver.  I can't...  I hope he falls down an elevator shaft.  This twat.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  You want to talk about dreams?  There's a doctor on the line.  Oh, boy.  I are.  Dr. Loomis.  Oh, great.  He dreamt he helped Michael Myers.  Because that was your name in the movie.  Yeah, of course.  You guys, just drop a little knowledge on you guys about sleep. 
[01:25:30]  I've been in sleep for about 10 years.  Wake up.  We've been sleeping for 18 plus.  I don't sleep good at all.  Yeah, they admitted it.  One guy was actually annoyed because I say 18 and a half years.  Because that's how long it's been.  Man, what are you going to do?  Round up?  Will you stop saying 18 and a half years?  Enough.  Dr. Loomis.  Yes, go ahead, Loomis.  I presume.  Go ahead.  You forget about 90% of the dreams that you have. 
[01:26:00]  And your last current dream, which generally then your sleep cycle when you're waking up,  you'll remember the most portion of that.  So whatever your thoughts are that I remember five or six dreams throughout the night, complete bullshit.  Complete bullshit.  If somebody tells you I remembered six dreams from the night before, complete bullshit.  I remember another one, though, from the coffee can from last night.  A completely different one.  The coffee can could stick.  The coffee can could stick there. 
[01:26:30]  But no, technically speaking, you do forget about 90% of the dreams in your last dream that  you're coming out of from the night, that's where you'll pick up the most.  But I remember another one from last night.  You're saying, like, what?  I can only remember the last one?  More than likely it was incorporated all in the same time.  No.  No.  I know.  There were two distinct, and maybe even three, now that I think about it, three distinct different  dreams last night that I remember.  Not as well, not as vividly as the coffee can dream, but I do remember somebody was trying 
[01:27:00]  to get into my house, and I had my gun in my hand, and I was pointing at the door, and  I was trying to see who it was through the window.  That happens a lot.  Of course it does.  Yeah.  Hey, I love the show, guys.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, Doc.  What's the other one?  I was in a hotel room.  Yeah?  And there were a bunch of people around.  More guns involved.  A lot of guns in my dreams.  Pew, pew, pew. 
[01:27:30]  Guns of my dream.  Yeah.  Can we go back to the XM publicity shot?  Ooh!  A lot of people had fun.  It got brutal to read the comments after a while.  I Instagrammed it.  OP Radio on Instagram.  Um, there's more shit going on in this picture than I never realized until, uh...  Really?  Yesterday.  Yeah.  They added an elbow to my picture.  What?  I got two elbows.  No way.  Look!  Let me see.  He added my arm in the picture, too.  Oh, right there. 
[01:28:00]  Where?  What do you mean, where?  What the hell is that?  He added my arm as well.  I never noticed this until yesterday.  There's two elbows.  I don't even know if that's my arm, to be completely honest with you.  It looks dead.  It looks...  It doesn't look right.  You know why?  Not only did he take a different picture of you, and I think he...  I think he cut...  And then people are saying, obviously this guy hated you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's terrible.  Or hated you guys.  Uh-huh.  Because your eyebrow is manufactured, too. 
[01:28:30]  Uh-huh.  That look...  You didn't do that look like that.  No.  You didn't?  No.  And then I noticed yesterday, looking at this picture, that I got two elbows, because  he...  I guess he added my left arm in the picture for whatever reason.  That's fucking hilarious.  I didn't realize that.  Is he still working here?  I fucking hate this guy.  I can't even tell you, because he did exactly what I said.  I begged him not to do this.  Is he still working here, or no?  I have no idea.  Because he was showing me after the photo shoot what he could do with his new program, 
[01:29:00]  and I looked at him, I said, dude, do not do any of this.  Don't do that.  And I assumed he wasn't gonna.  And he had so much power, because no one was really in charge of XM at the time.  So I got two elbows, and then the other thing I noticed, he took my chin away.  You probably had to do that when he extended your neck.  Well, I think when he cut out my face from another picture, he cut a bunch of my chin away as well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you see that?  Oh, my God.  Like, the distance between my lower lip and my chin, I have way more room than what's in that picture. 
[01:29:30]  Where's the double elbow?  Show me the other elbow.  Oh, my God.  Look at the double elbow.  Oh, that's what I said.  Is that a second elbow?  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, it is.  And then there's, like, a huge lump.  He cut, yeah.  Oh, my arm.  I don't have that.  What is that?  Why did he cut your arm off and then put a new arm on?  Like, where was that arm that he needed to do that?  Because it wasn't properly posed.  This guy stinks. 
[01:30:00]  But this is a picture that, to this day, they use here and there.  But when we first hit satellite, and we were getting press all over the fucking place, this  was the picture they used everywhere.  I'm wondering if he, if your arm was on the board, right?  Right.  But he had a different shot of me and you.  This isn't us in the same picture at all.  No.  And needed to cut down from where my hand is.  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:30]  And put it together.  But that cut your arm off, so he put a new arm on you.  So he twisted the arm.  Yes, he twisted the arm around.  I think you're onto something.  I think so.  Because that might be my bicep on my forearm.  I think it is.  That's your, because that shot's taken a lot straighter on the arm than up and down.  After all these years, I never noticed the horrendous job he did on my left arm.  Worst photographer ever.  He was a terrible guy.  And then look at your right arm.  Uh-huh.  What's going on with that? 
[01:31:00]  Why is it fuzzy over there?  Dude, it looks like the first part, that's been, that's been put on.  Yes.  Wait, he fucking gave you a fake arm, too.  That right arm is fake.  Yes, it is.  Look at it.  He put my arm in, too, because it crosses over where he had a...  Dude.  Oh, my God.  Like, because there's no way you would have put your arm up like that.  It looks like you're wearing a fucking hairy, like, wristband.  Yeah, because it's all fuzzy where the cut is.  Yeah, he... 
[01:31:30]  Holy shit.  He photoshopped and it didn't even do a good job.  What a douchebag.  But I don't understand why we never noticed the arms until yesterday.  Well, look at the fucking faces.  How was it?  It was impossible to look away from those.  Well, then he opened my eyes.  Did he?  To what, Topey?  To what?  Yeah, good point.  But your right arm is fake.  My left arm is completely fake.  Yeah.  He took away a little of my chin.  He made your eyebrow do that.  Yeah, up higher and put the fake arm on. 
[01:32:00]  I think you might have done that in one pose, but then your other eye might have been closed,  so he opened up your eye.  Yeah.  Wow, did he fuck that up.  Why couldn't he just take a fucking picture?  Just take a fucking picture, right?  He's a douche, that's why.  He's a douche.  Oh, God.  So now I got two elbows, an extended neck.  I got two Adam's apples, two elbows.  And I got a bicep on my forearm.  And Anthony's arm looks like...  Your arm is so weird. 
[01:32:30]  It's fake.  It looks like...  It's fake.  It looks like a monkey's arm.  It does.  It's all fucking blurred.  And way too hairy up near the bottom of your forearm and your wrist.  And it's too Popeye-ish.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a muscle, a weird muscle.  You have cankle arms.  Oh, fucking dick.  And I begged him.  I saw what he was thinking.  I go, look, do not do that.  It doesn't look good. 
[01:33:00]  Because no, man, you're going to be happy.  You're going to be happy, I'm telling you.  I hope that guy is fired.  I hope he got fired.  I don't even know his name.  Do you remember?  Have you seen him since?  I used to see him and I...  The rage I felt.  You know, obviously I can't do anything.  What was his answer to that?  I'd fucking strangle him.  What was his answer?  I would call him out on him.  Like, you really fucked up this picture, you idiot.  Oh, what'd he say?  He didn't say much of anything.  Jimmy, he didn't say much of anything.  You have an elbow crook in the middle of your forearm on top. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know what that is.  What is that?  And then the hand looks all fucked up.  I don't even know if that's my hand, I'll be honest with you.  No, he might have put a stunt hand in.  He just found an arm.  I swear to you, I don't recognize that as my left hand.  Unfortunately, we can't see the trademark thumb.  Yeah.  Just make sure.  Wait.  Can he cut your thumb off? 
[01:34:00]  Oh, no.  I hide my thumbs in photographs.  Do you?  Like Megan Fox?  Yeah.  I mean, Megan Fox.  No, it's not as bad as Megan Fox.  Oh, my God.  Anyway.  People are enjoying this picture, though.  They can't get enough of us.  These guys look so grody in that picture.  All righty.  Thanks, Valley Jim.  You want a break, and then we can talk about Lions and the video out of Indiana University,  which is really good?  Yes, let's do that. 
[01:34:30]  And other things.  Oh, is Don King coming in or not?  We don't know.  He got booked on TV.  We got Daryl, and I don't know about Don.  We got Daryl Hammond coming in at 9.  That should be really good.  Don King's possible.  Oh, we definitely have David Lee Roth coming in.  Monday.  Fuck, Rogan just did a great podcast with him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  Go to Joe Rogan on Twitter.  He just tweeted about it, and you can find David Lee Roth.  It's also airing on our channel this weekend.  It is.  I was going to ask you about that, E-Rock.  You're on it.  Cool.  So this weekend on this very channel, you get to hear Joe Rogan and David Lee Roth just 
[01:35:00]  shooting the shit.  What else, Sam?  You got that bit if you want to play it.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  I knew there was something.  Yeah, we'll stay here, E-Rock.  We got a brand new bit from the boys.  Oh, my God.  Troy Kwan, Sam.  Who else was involved in this one?  That's it.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show,  The Guys Learn Old Habits Die Hard.  Jimmy, you okay, man?  You feel all right?  Yeah.  You seem sick or something.  I'm just...  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  When Jimmy shows up late, questions arise. 
[01:35:30]  You all right?  You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one fucking time.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  You might be sensitive here.  Yeah, I don't fucking...  What the fuck do I care?  Have you been drinking?  Who fucking cares?  What?  What?  Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Listen as friends and listeners come together to solve a problem.  Well, Mongo the Trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock.  Fuck Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show? 
[01:36:00]  But now it's the Opie and Anthony and Mongo show?  Get fucked, Mongo.  But at least he still thinks Gary sucks.  I think we've proven we care.  Ha!  Yeah!  Fuck him.  Where's Gary?  Fuck him.  Laugh, love, and learn.  You're not going to drink today, right?  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man.  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do.  Fair enough.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Fuck you, I'm fine.  That's so sad. 
[01:36:30]  That's such an uncomfortable character.  It was sad.  What did that make me think of?  Oh, fuck.  It just made me think of something.  Mm-hmm.  A drunk.  Mm-hmm.  Ah, get my memories going.  I hope I don't have the fucking...  The Rhoda?  Valerie Harper, yeah.  Oh, no.  The Rhoda?  Rhoda.  My memory has been evaporating.  Three months to live.  Holy fuck.  Rhoda, I'm fucking stern.  Hey, uh...  Wait, I'm sorry, wait.  Was your phone drinking?  Mm-hmm.  What the fuck?  Did that make me think of something to say? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, man.  It'll pop back up.  I almost said.  Give it a minute.  Are you acting right now?  No.  Oh.  It was pretty good.  The guy's name was Mark, who did our picture.  The guy was in graphics for XM.  This is Don Wicklund helping me out.  Oh, thank you.  And I just wrote, still with the company.  I'm wondering if the guy's still there.  Hopefully, himself really fucked us, man.  What a cunt.  This, at the time, was the most important picture ever taken of us.  I know, right? 
[01:37:30]  Look at it.  We were bizarre creatures.  During our NEW heyday, we had a lot of fucking pictures out there.  But this was the most important after, like, two and a half years, no one hearing or seeing us.  They're like, we need to get the pictures taken, guys.  And that was it.  We were on an Xcella from New York all the way down to Washington just to take this picture.  Old fucking fuzzy-armed eyebrow guy and giraffe.  Yeah.  Yeah, with two elbows.  You see the two elbows, right, Travis? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  The guy's no longer with the company.  Thank you, Don Wicklund.  Terrific.  This is the return of the radio band.  It's the worst photo ever?  Ever.  You don't think it's good, Travis?  It's terrible.  What's your best?  What's your favorite part?  Your neck.  Yeah.  The neck is so good.  Double-neck McGillicuddy.  The neck is so bizarrely long.  And you can see where he was supposed to match up the Adam's apples.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're totally right.  I'm totally Adam's apples, yes, because I have two in the picture.  And then the new... 
[01:38:30]  Every day we discover something new.  A new fuck-up.  Ant's right arm is fake.  It's not my...  It's not...  It might be your arm from another photo.  Yeah.  And Ant's eyes are so weird in the photos.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're like...  I don't know what's going on.  I got it...  Your left one's smaller.  I got even a new fucking thing I just picked out.  Oh.  Your arm's too short.  To box with God.  On top of it being a fake arm, it's too short.  It's too short.  Go full picture.  Oh, my God.  This guy sucks. 
[01:39:00]  You got a baby arm.  They gave you a baby arm.  Your left arm is literally a foot longer than your right arm.  Opium thalidomide.  Your right arm...  It's small.  Your right arm is small and too short.  It's smaller.  He scaled down my fucking arm.  This fucking asshole.  Yeah, look.  It looks like you're in the Thriller video or something.  Which arm is too short?  The right one, right?  Way too short.  Look at it. 
[01:39:30]  It's not only too short.  It's small.  It's too small.  Look at my arm and everything.  It's too small.  There's no room for a bicep.  No.  Because the shoulder is almost...  What are you leaning on?  That was taken from you leaning on a table.  Look at the way it's straight.  You're not leaning on anything.  No.  You're leaning on midair.  I'm not leaning on that.  It's like this.  Right.  I'm just placing an arm there.  Yeah.  Your right shoulder doesn't exist.  Yeah.  No.  And there is no right shoulder.  There's no right shoulder.  I'm leaning on that.  Can we make a list of everything wrong with the photo?  I think this should be the new photo you guys sign it as. 
[01:40:00]  I agree.  Well, now it's famous.  Absolutely.  It's now the famous photo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Certainly.  And I get to plug my Instagram.  Oh, is that terrible?  Opie Radio if you want to see the photo.  I don't like it.  Can I add that my hair has never been that color?  I just want to add that.  I'm going to ask you.  Okay.  That's my favorite part.  It's never been.  I did a lot of beaching when we were off, but I don't think my hair can possibly get  that color ever.  He fucked with every single setting.  Opie's neck's too long.  Opie has two Adam's apples. 
[01:40:30]  Let's start with me.  Okay.  Don't forget the two elbows and the bicep muscle on my forearm.  Two elbows.  And my chin.  He took away some of my chin.  He shaved it down.  Wow, he went to town with his new Photoshop program.  That's what he did.  He didn't need to do anything.  He got this new program and couldn't wait to fucking see what he could do.  He didn't use it because he needed to.  He used it because he wanted to use it.  Right.  Let me do this.  Yeah.  Oh, maybe I could do this.  I do remember they took at least 100 pictures that day. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  They just kept snapping, snapping.  Couldn't find one where we just fucking, that was it.  Right.  He had to take us, first of all, from two separate pictures, put that together, and then take  various fucking body parts to stitch it together.  It's like Mr. Potato Head photography.  Why didn't we notice all the other stuff wrong with this photo?  Because we were so shocked by the faces and the neck.  The neck was so outrageously ridiculous that we forgot about all the other, never looked  at the other stuff.  Your right arm could be the best part of this picture now. 
[01:41:30]  Today it is.  Your right arm is so much shorter than your left arm in this picture.  It's smaller and shorter.  He scaled it down.  He scaled that arm down.  Because he had to make it look like, you know, forced perspective shit.  And he put it in where it wasn't even going.  I don't know what...  That's not good.  I think he got that, because there were some pictures where I was sitting at the board  also, and I was leaning on it.  He probably got the arm from that, cut it out, shoved it in my arm socket. 
[01:42:00]  The only thing I could say about this photo, I was definitely wearing that shirt that  day, and my right arm looks real.  Yeah, there you go.  That's the only thing I could say is officially real about this picture.  I found something.  Oh, Chippa?  It don't say SiriusXM.  All right, what's the list, Sam?  What's the list?  Opie's neck is too long. 
[01:42:30]  Yes.  Opie has two Adam's apples.  Yes.  Opie never had that color hair.  Opie has two elbows.  Opie has a bicep on his forearm.  Yes.  Part of Opie's chin is missing.  This sounds like a series of children's books.  Opie has two elbows.  It's about boys who are special.  Yes.  Ant's eyes are weird.  Yeah.  Ant's eyebrow was raised.  Yeah.  Ant has no right shoulder.  Mm-hmm.  Ant's right arm is significantly shorter and smaller than his left arm.  Could he call it a baby arm?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It makes me chuckle. 
[01:43:00]  Just say baby arm.  Ant has a baby arm.  Like, A-K-A baby arm.  A-A baby arm.  Oh, no.  You could have kept that whole description.  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  Yeah.  And then write A-K-A baby arm.  Baby arm.  I love when we make our dumb lists.  I got to have a list.  I'm sure they hate that.  This merits a list.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll Instagram the list, too, Sam.  All right.  I get the picture.  Looking at it, like, from that, how did I not notice that arm?  I'm suspicious of your left, oh, no, that might be the logo.  Your watch. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Oh, it is the logo.  You're right.  That's the logo.  Okay.  Yellow from the logo.  I found something!  Wait.  That's not from the logo.  Oh, shit.  There's three lines atop.  And then three lines below.  He's right.  That logo is two different logos put together, because that X really looks like it's kind  of tilting to the left.  Dode.  Dode.  Dode.  Oh, my God!  I see what you're saying!  This is supposed to curve up, and this is obviously going down.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that shouldn't...  Wow.  There's no line that... 
[01:44:00]  Wait.  Okay.  Wait.  Now the logo is fucked up.  No, no, no.  Your arm was in front of the logo and not in the picture, but that should be black behind  your wristwatch.  Right.  So that part of my arm is taken when...  So your left arm's not real either in that picture.  Nope.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That came from another photo where...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm telling you.  That yellow is not matching this logo.  And he never got rid of the yellow.  He never got rid of the yellow to match it up.  And wait a minute.  Doesn't it look like these are...  Like the little curly parts? 
[01:44:30]  Aren't they supposed to be under each other?  Yes, it's two different logos.  Yep.  Wait, what do you mean?  What do you mean?  The bottom part of the XM logo doesn't match up with the top part.  Yes.  With those lines, those three lines above the XM and the three lines below the XM, if  you guys know the logo, those aren't matching up.  I'm trying to figure out what he did, why he did that.  He puts your head on...  The lower part of your body...  Your head is from another picture.  Yeah, he puts your head on.  Your head...  Motherfucker!  Why didn't we notice all this shit? 
[01:45:00]  Dude, look at the fucking uneven half circles under the XM logo.  Get the XM logo and put it next to the picture.  Oh my god.  Right, good idea.  Let's compare.  Can we put all this on the Facebook page, EROC, so people can follow?  Holy shit.  It's been on there.  All right, see how it matches up?  Yeah, it's perfectly even under and over, like a circle that's been split in the middle.  See?  They're supposed to match up.  Oh my god.  Those curvy yellow lines.  They're playing along at home. 
[01:45:30]  Okay.  Someone else noticed.  My microphone, look at the part of the microphone above the mic stand that's in front of it  and below the mic stand that's in front of it.  It's not lining up.  Could you zoom that out?  Oh my god!  It's like...  It's off to the right.  It's off to one side.  He used the bar from that top, from that microphone, as the cut point.  Right.  He cut right there.  Wait, so...  Wrapped around, cut again.  Yeah.  I'm trying to look exactly where he made his cuts. 
[01:46:00]  You see the mic stand or whatever?  Yeah.  That's the cut from another picture, and that's why you got a little piece of the...  Look, you got the mic flag there, and then you got a piece of the mic flag underneath, too.  Wait, where, where, where?  Yeah.  Look at the mic flag.  These mic flags don't match up at all.  Go to the mic flag by my mouth.  That one.  This mic flag's too long.  Now go across.  Go there.  Look, there's mic flag there, too.  This fucking piece of shit.  Wait, isn't that my mic flag?  Yeah, that's your mic flag.  That's yours.  That's your mic flag.  Like, that's fine. 
[01:46:30]  But this is answering mic flag flag.  Yeah, but the mic doesn't match up.  That's where the cut is.  Yeah.  So now it's official that, obviously, your right arm's from a different picture, and  I bet you your left wrist, because something about your wrist doesn't look right to me,  so that came from another picture as well.  That came from a picture where, obviously, the logo was behind me and coming out there.  He just loved this new program, and I was having fun.  He chopped the shit out of everything.  But the giraffe neck was the one thing we all focused on for years, and now we're fine.  Now there's like, we're up to like 12 different things wrong with this picture. 
[01:47:00]  But who would have thought to look for this stuff?  He probably knew that.  He's like, okay.  It's kind of fun.  It is fun.  It's a game.  You know how they have two pictures in a magazine, you guys figure out which is different?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, someone is saying...  All right, wait.  Go to the picture.  I got to see something.  I think someone's just fucked with us.  Someone is saying your thumb is missing.  Which one?  There's something going on.  Wait, what's going on when you're right?  Maybe the thumb was like over the edge of something.  Can you zoom in? 
[01:47:30]  I think this guy's right.  Your thumb is missing.  Where's my thumb?  Dude, that's a terrible stepfinger.  Your thumb is missing.  I thought this guy was fucking around.  Where's your nail?  Did he cut my thumb off?  Yes.  Yeah, Sal just said in my earphones, you can see the circular part here where he cut this.  Oh my...  I thought Matt in Connecticut was fucked with us.  You don't have a thumb in this picture.  Oh my God.  You have hand like the chimp victim lady.  What's that pick? 
[01:48:00]  Wait, what's going on now?  What are you looking at, Iraq?  Uh...  No, excuse me.  Iraq comment.  There's an inconsistency issue besides the inconsistency issues.  Yeah.  The photo that we have here is not the same that was on the press shot.  What?  So I don't know if that was on the website and this is what we actually were handing out.  Let me see.  Well, didn't they say they were going to fix it at some point?  And they probably fixed some of the errors.  Oh my God.  What?  There's my thumb.  There's...  There's Opie's hand.  Opie's hand. 
[01:48:30]  With your single...  Wait, let me see.  Oh my God.  There's that.  There's the way the logo was and my wrist.  That's the real photo.  That's the real photo.  That's the actual picture.  I'm not making the eyebrow.  So...  But where did you get the picture that's online?  All you have to do is Google Opie and Anthony.  Where's the original photo?  But why did that even end up on fucking line for anyone to see?  That's the online photo.  Dude.  That's the one they used on Fox News.  Yes.  That one you're holding open is probably the original. 
[01:49:00]  Because look at your lower hand.  It's out.  It looks normal.  It's on top of the console.  There's no glow.  It's the one that went out to everybody.  Yes.  I'm telling you.  It absolutely is.  The photo I'm looking at isn't as bad.  Like, my neck is normal size.  You can see that Ant actually has a thumb.  Look for the XM logo.  The XM logo matches up.  Ant's watch.  Is there any yellow behind Ant's watch on the picture you're holding?  No.  Black.  What does Ant's neck look like in that photo?  Because in this photo, it appears he doesn't have much of a neck.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  He has a neck in this photo.  So why didn't they just use...  Why did they go and put that online?  By the way, I don't think I've ever seen this picture.  I've only seen the shitty one.  That picture probably came out after you went on the air and complained about this one back in the day.  Guaranteed.  That's the corrected version.  But that one's already been out.  But yeah, but this is the one that came out.  They wanted the eyebrow.  I know that was online everywhere.  This fucking guy fucked us.  On the actual XM website. 
[01:50:00]  And then someone said, you know, all we need...  This is the picture.  This is a picture where we both just looked all right in the picture.  And they used it.  Your hair's a different color in that picture you have in your hand.  Can you imagine that fucking eyebrow raised?  That cocksucker making a decision to do that?  I think he just took the smudge to it and went...  Yeah.  He raised your eyebrow.  Oh, that's ridiculous.  If you made that face, I would hate you.  I know that picture went everywhere.  Because of the giraffe neck.  Just doing some quick Google image research. 
[01:50:30]  That photo was in Engadget.  That photo was in the New York Times.  This is...  You went on the air and you complained about this photo back in whatever, 2004.  Right.  Then they made that photo to try to appease you.  Yeah.  Right.  Which was...  Which looks like the original.  Yeah, that picture's all right.  I wouldn't complain about that picture.  That's actually not a bad photo at all.  But this is the one that went out when they said, Opie and Anthony are coming back to radio.  This is the one.  Why?  Because he took my...  And then he moved my left arm. 
[01:51:00]  Why?  What a dumb...  And then he gave Ann an eyebrow, a baby arm, and Ann doesn't have a fucking thumb in the  picture.  That was in the New York Times story about you guys signing on October 4th, 2004.  This is a different shot.  It's very close.  But it's...  You look at your shoulder.  He didn't manipulate this one to make that one.  It's different.  It's from a different angle.  Right.  It's from a higher angle.  Well, remember, like I said...  He took a fuckload of pictures.  They took hundreds of pictures from all sorts of different angles. 
[01:51:30]  And then this guy decided that he liked, you know, your eye in this picture, so I'm  going to move the fucking eye.  I guess he didn't like my thumb.  You don't have a thumb in this picture.  I thought the guy was kidding.  And now someone's saying that the reflection on the table by Opie's arm is wrong.  Oh, oh, should it be?  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it doesn't look like it matches.  This is fucking guy.  That guy is the worst.  All these years later, it still drives me nuts.  He's the worst photographer ever.  I found something. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Chip, what is it?  Fucking phone's not plugged in.  Very good.  But this is the picture that went in the New York Times.  Isn't that great?  The one that we have is a corrected version.  Yeah, and that picture looks fine.  Why couldn't they just use that?  I remember the guy being obsessed with Anthony's eyebrow.  Ooh.  Where he raised his eyebrow up.  What a cock.  I bet you it all started with that.  You motherfucker. 
[01:52:30]  He loved just chopping shit up.  Oh, was he there all night?  Maybe I could take this.  Why don't I do this?  And then he leaves things in like the yellow part of the fucking logo.  Right.  That wasn't there.  I mean, it's like a person using iMovie for the first time, and then it's full of effects  because it's fun.  Because it's fun.  Yeah.  That photo of you guys is pretty good.  The N.E.W. one, where Ant's looking to the left and laughing, Ops looking straight  ahead.  That's a good shot of you guys.  Dog in the middle.  What do you want from me?  Which one?  Yeah.  Second one down.  This one?  Yeah, that's a good picture. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, God.  I look like I'm old.  Just out of college.  Yeah.  This one's fine.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Can you put the online picture and the actual photo on our Facebook page, E-Rock?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  It'll be up on Opie and Anthony, the two pictures.  The one they should...  Yeah.  Terrible.  This picture was in every fucking magazine.  Right.  I mean, you know how I know that this is the corrected version? 
[01:53:30]  There's just one Adam sample.  Right.  And that was the problem.  How's the chin?  I have more chin.  Significantly longer.  See?  Mm-hmm.  Look at that.  What the fuck to this guy?  Did he hate us?  No, you know what it was?  It's from a different angle.  It's the same chin, but it's like a shrunk down picture.  Does it look like that or no?  So it's almost like the neck was from a picture where it's blown up to an eight, and the head  is from a picture where it's blown up to a five.  Could you show me the picture that you have, Sam, where there's no Photoshopping going on? 
[01:54:00]  Just lift it up.  Because I got another thing to add.  Yeah.  I do have another thing to add.  Oh.  He made my head small.  He did.  I got a shrunken head.  I got a shrunken head.  He shrunk his shrunken head.  I got a shrunken head.  Shrunken head.  Put shrunken head.  Well, it goes with the longer neck.  Opie has shrunken head.  I got a long neck and a shrunken head.  Put the phone's not plugged in.  No.  Go to our Facebook page when E-Roc gets this up.  An actual picture where they didn't Photoshop, and then the one that went everywhere.  No, not Opie's head is shrunken.  Opie has a shrunken head. 
[01:54:30]  I have a shrunken head.  Yes, Opie has a shrunken head.  There's no, you can't see the V.  Opie's V, the guy covered up with a shrunken head.  I never had a V.  I never had a V.  I never had a V.  You do now.  What's the worst?  I think, I think I have to say the worst part of this photo is Anthony's baby arm.  The baby arm is really bad.  The fucking baby arm.  Oh my God. 
[01:55:00]  We got fucked so bad on this one.  Ah, that's a good picture.  The copyright on this photo is a different name than the one that you read.  What do you mean?  What was the guy's name that you said?  Mark, Mark.  That's not, it says copyright 2004, John Harrington.  That was probably the photographer.  And then they gave the picture to this Mark guy who was in graphics.  So it's not the photographer.  Don Wicklund told me the guy worked in graphics at the time. 
[01:55:30]  So it's just a guy who just photoshops.  Yeah.  But you might have hated, dude, you might have hated the photographer all the time for no reason.  He left six years ago.  Thank God.  You might have hated the photographer and it wasn't him.  You said you hated the photographer.  You'd see him around.  He might not have done this.  He may have just turned in the images.  Right.  I always thought it was the photographer himself, but I don't know.  And Don is saying, don't forget the pic that had Ant's mole on his face.  I don't have a mole.  I know.  And he writes, that never existed, exclamation point, exclamation point. 
[01:56:00]  I don't remember that one.  And then writes, we still have that pic hanging in the halls of XM and DC.  Don, you guys, take a picture of that and send it to my phone.  Yeah, Wiki, take a picture.  Wait, this is a picture of you with a fake mole?  I don't know.  Yeah, it was from CBS when you took the new ones for CBS.  Why would they give you a mole?  What is that about?  They were trying to...  You're wearing the dress shirts.  It's the ones that went on the buses and everything.  Why does he have a mole?  I don't know, but we talked about it a while ago.  I don't remember.  I was talking about it.  It's that photo. 
[01:56:30]  Right there.  He has the mole right up near his nose.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Make this bigger.  Zoom in on that.  What the fuck?  Why are they fucking...  I don't know.  What is that?  That was the one that was on all the buses.  Your mole.  You don't have a mole in there.  You doing that picture?  Why do you have a mole?  I don't have one.  They added a mole to your photo.  Why do you have a mole? 
[01:57:00]  It's okay.  That wasn't in every subway station in New York City.  Holy shit.  That was on the side of Madison Square Garden.  I don't know.  Why do you have a mole?  It's astounding.  I don't know.  That's what I can...  Remember the caricatures?  Do you like the caricatures?  Those short cartoon people?  Oh, right.  Those were...  They were better than the Photoshop.  Someone's saying the doctored picture still pops up on car devices.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Really? 
[01:57:30]  So.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page so you can have a good laugh.  Could you put the list of things wrong with the photo, Sam?  Yeah.  There's more, too, I'm sure.  Oh, there's a fuckload more.  All right.  What's the list again before we go to break for real?  Obi's neck is too long.  Obi has two Adam's apples.  Obi never had hair that color.  Obi has two elbows.  Obi has a bicep on his forearm.  Part of Obi's chin is missing.  Obi has a shrunken head. 
[01:58:00]  Yes, you do.  Now, what's that?  Ant's eyes are weird.  Ant's eyebrow was raised.  Ant has no right shoulder.  Ant's right arm is significantly shorter and smaller than his left arm, a.k.a. baby arm.  Ant's mic doesn't match up with the mic stand at all.  Ant's thumb is cut off.  The logo in the background is fucked.  Anyway, there it is so far.  And this picture went everywhere.  Wow, who the fuck was in charge? 
[01:58:30]  Don Wicklin.  Wait, go back to the picture again.  It was before Dottie.  It was before Dot Wicklin.  That's that one.  Wow.  What?  You found a new one, Jimmy?  No.  Someone just said the change.  But I don't think there's change.  Well, the reflection goes off.  Well, it was, it wasn't on the XM website.  So that's a good thing. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, but New York Times, you know, a little publication like that.  Because I'm looking at like old screen caps of the XM website.  And it's just those two caricatures.  Right.  I can't say that.  Right.  Say it.  Caricature.  Caricature.  Caricature.  Oh, what a douche.  Say it again.  Caricature.  Say enemans.  Entemans.  I'm going to try.  He used the mic stands as the cut points in a lot of this.  So he sliced down the mic stand that's coming from the right that fucked up the logo. 
[01:59:30]  And then he went down and around the microphone and that other mic stand.  And then back down.  He cut off my arm.  I got a new one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're missing part of your chest.  I know, I know you're turned toward the camera, but you're missing part of your chest.  Because that's where the cut was.  That angle, that mic stand starting and then, you know, it cuts down to the right and then down toward the left. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Like you said, that's where he cut the picture so he could get two different pictures together.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he didn't give you enough chest.  Whoa.  You see what I'm saying?  I think.  I got it.  I got it.  It's too straight.  I think you're right.  It's too straight.  He cut it.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Zoom in on my left armpit.  Your left armpit?  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead. 
[02:00:30]  That's your...  No, the left one.  What is that?  Oh, that's the white stripe from the shirt.  Okay.  Yep.  But there's some fuzz there because he didn't...  Some fuzz.  He took away a little bit of your chest.  This fucking guy.  He really cheese whizzed us.  What an awful fucking Frankenstein picture.  He just pieced it together.  Wow.  All these years later we found it.  I'm sure there's more shit too. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  Gary Hahn was in charge back then.  The shot with the mole was corrected before it was hung up outside of MSG.  Remember him?  Yeah.  But for some reason you all of a sudden have a mole on your face.  I forgot about Gary Hahn.  Wow.  Yes.  All those names from the past.  He admitted that he didn't believe in us at first and then he...  Oh.  And then he...  Thanks.  But then he admitted that he got it.  Go back to the picture.  I think I got something.  A lot of people didn't really get us at first down there. 
[02:01:30]  What do you got there?  And we outlasted every single one of them.  Fuckers.  And they thought we went in...  We'd have a quick run on XM.  Fuck Watts.  I found something!  Yeah.  What do you got, Chip?  There's nothing on the computer monitors.  Mm-hmm.  There are no...  Yeah, you can't...  There are no computer monitors.  Why aren't we going to break?  Yeah.  Well, that should have been the...  Out right there, but...  I found three things of great importance. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, shit.  Of great importance.  We got a couple more things to talk about before Daryl Hammond gets in here at 9 o'clock,  so...  I remember what I wanted to say before.  Yeah?  It's minor.  We talked about the drinking.  Yeah.  I was watching The Sopranos last night, season 6, when Christopher relapses in the bar  of Pauly the Toast after that big argument, and then he just realizes, baby, when she  fucking looks at me, and in my eyes...  Do you remember that scene?  Yes.  And everyone's looking at him, and he's so obviously drugged.  I almost had to turn it off. 
[02:02:30]  It was so uncomfortable.  Oh, it was so embarrassing.  That was so well done, man.  Ooh.  It made me cringe.  Oh, that's terrible.  That's your character right there.  It's fucking life.  I was like, oh my God.  It was humiliating.  We got a great video coming out of Indiana University, and we also want to talk about  that lion thing for a little bit, and then we got Daryl Hammond coming in at 9 o'clock.  What is he promoting?  Caroline's?  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Daryl Hammond coming in in about a half hour. 
[02:03:00]  What's he got going on?  He's fucking cowards.  My friends. 
[02:03:30]  Nice to know I'm not the only one that can't sell it out in advance.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's too far in advance is what it is.  Yeah, it is.  It's too far in advance.  When are you at, Caroline's?  April 11th through 14th.  Nice.  I'm in fucking tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, Charlotte, North Carolina, Funny Bones.  Ooh.  Are you excited about that?  I am, actually.  I want to do the gig, but, you know, it should be terrific. 
[02:04:00]  Big celebrity show.  Funny Bones, Charlotte.  I've got to get something going on, Charlotte.  I've got to get something going on.  I don't.  Yes.  You're right here with us.  No, I mean, you've got to be on TV or something to draw.  You just do it legitimately.  You know, you have to have a video project somewhere to draw.  Well, it seems like everyone's getting a TV show these days. 
[02:04:30]  Well, that's true.  I mean, everybody.  It does seem that way.  Everybody.  Everybody.  What happened?  Reading.  Reading.  Reading.  But now it's time to do the show.  Um, so, uh, this lion.  Oh, my God.  A animal sanctuary.  These sanctuaries, uh, what the hell are they all about?  Well, the lions should be in, uh, what they call Africa.  Not in California.  Oh, that's California?  I guess it was California.  And they have, um, they have interns. 
[02:05:00]  They have an intern program.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You think their intern program will be affected by the fact that a lion ate one of the interns?  Oh, boy.  A lion doody hat.  We kind of were having fun with this story knowing that, yeah, there might have been an  incident on the Opie and Anthony show.  I wasn't there, so I have no idea.  I don't know.  There is rumor that maybe an intern might have taken a shot to the nuts. 
[02:05:30]  Might have been a kick.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And, uh, we lost our intern program for how long?  Over a year, right?  Weren't even allowed to have interns.  Well over a year.  We weren't allowed to have interns.  And me and I were joking that even though, like, this lion ate an intern, I guarantee they'll  still have interns.  They'll have an intern program still.  Right.  But we weren't allowed to.  No.  We basically lost our interns because somebody ate an intern's lunch. 
[02:06:00]  They are keeping their interns even though somebody ate an intern.  Right.  Right.  You know they're going to have an intern program after this.  Exactly.  All I want to know is they didn't kill the lion, right?  I hate when they do that shit.  Yes, they did.  They did?  Yeah.  They did?  Absolutely.  They what?  Yep.  They killed the lion.  No.  Yeah.  You can't.  The lion's doing what it's supposed to be doing.  Well.  How'd they kill the lion?  Keep it on looking like that.  I guess they did.  And this particular lion was on Ellen DeGeneres as a little baby lion. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, was it?  Yes.  Oh, look.  It's adorable.  This is the big twist in the story.  This lion was featured on Ellen DeGeneres a few years back.  Why would they kill the fucking lion?  I hate when they do that.  It's a tragic story, obviously, but you're talking about wild animals.  They're doing exactly what they're supposed to do.  Their chemistry isn't fucked up.  Well, they probably like, got that taste for blood now.  What type of shit?  Then don't go in the cage.  Just throw stuff in the cage.  Yeah, make the fucking fence hire.  Bring in a big chair.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  They killed the lion, huh?  God, I hate that.  Mm-hmm.  Shame.  That's the lion, though, on Ellen DeGeneres.  DeGeneres.  Quality experience.  It's the lion.  But these are powerful creatures.  Yeah, we know.  We know.  I love when you have to get the animal expert.  These are powerful.  Really?  Very powerful.  I didn't know that.  These are not meant to be.  They are cute, but not meant to be household pets.  Right.  Really?  You really only need to have one bad moment. 
[02:07:30]  And it's not impossible to pay the ultimate price for that.  And that's why many zoos that keep lions, especially zoos that are part of the AZA community, have very strict rules and regulations when it comes to working with these animals and maintaining them.  Don't they all have strict rules and regulations?  What zoo doesn't have strict rules about dealing with the lions?  Just go in and head them.  Yeah, what zoo is loosey-goosey about it?  Yeah.  Hey, I want to go in a lion cage.  That's your business. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  What do you want me to do about it?  You might want to wear an oven mitt, but besides that, have fun.  What do you want me to do with the price of tea in China?  Who's supposed to feed the lions?  I don't know.  Whoever.  Whatever.  Doesn't matter, really.  He'll fend for himself.  He's a lion.  That's unbelievable.  So they killed the lion.  That's too bad.  Yeah.  But I guess what happened was there was this intern.  Right.  Hot intern.  Hot intern.  Blonde.  Beautiful.  And she got mauled.  Which makes it hurts a little more when you see that she's dead.  Mauled to death.  What are the circumstances? 
[02:08:30]  What happened?  Was she in somewhere where she wasn't supposed to be?  Did the enclosure have a failure?  I know this story.  Yes.  Coming.  She put some peanut butter on her pussy.  Oh, see.  And thought the lion would behave and just licked the...  If a dog is good, a lion's got to be great.  A lion licking your pussy's got to be better.  Big lion tongue.  Just took a giant bite out of her.  I don't know.  Why was the intern in the cage with the lion? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  What happened?  Sam?  They said the sanctuary is not releasing details yet on why Hanson, the intern...  No, why?  Well, the band was in the lion's cage.  Because they probably thought it was safe enough for her to just be in the fucking cage  with the lion.  Oh, the lion's...  Those lions are so nice.  And the humans think they're so friendly and they identify them and know them that they  forget that at any moment this fucking dumb thing will just lay its teeth into you.  You can't blow off thousands of years of evolution. 
[02:09:30]  Millions, yeah.  Millions, whatever.  What am I saying?  Thousands.  You're right.  Sorry.  You can't blow off...  You can't blow off 50 years of evolution.  But you can't blow off that shit thinking, all right, well, we raised it from, you know,  from birth.  It's a baby and it loves us.  Look, look.  No, there's still weird shit in that fucking DNA.  They just see her in a certain way and it's like, oh, it's a gazelle.  Right.  Let me lay my teeth into his throat.  They said one of the other employees jumped in the cage and tried to distract the lion.  Right.  But, I mean, the intern was too delicious.  The lion said, get out of here. 
[02:10:00]  It looked tasty.  Yeah.  So what exactly happened?  What are the details?  They won't get them out now.  Why?  I'm sure it's for lawsuit purposes.  Don't make a comment.  Now someone's bringing up a good point.  How about we get the drones involved?  Oh, how?  Oh, drone strike on the lion?  Well, first of all, this guy's saying we could feed the lions with the drones, but  if a lion is acting up, then maybe you take out the lion with a drone.  Don't you just have to throw the food over the fence? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, take a bucket and throw it through the fence.  Here you go, dick face.  Here's your lunch, cunt.  That's all you need to do.  So why are people getting eaten by these creatures?  Because they love going in there and interacting with them to tell all their friends, you know,  they really are gentle.  They're gentle creatures.  No, they'll fucking rip your throat out.  Yes, when they're not biting your face out, it's delightful.  True.  Well, that story's big, didn't I?  It should have been the owners of the place instead of, you know, instead of a lowly little intern. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  That's a shame.  You got a picture of this brood?  Pop a picture of this brood.  What do you know what she looks like?  Samuel.  That's what she looks like.  Well, that's a jellyfish.  What the hell is that?  That's a jellyfish.  Yeah.  Why are you showing us pictures of jellyfish?  You didn't have to look at that one.  Oh.  Do you have her name?  Let's put her name up there.  She was a volunteer intern. 
[02:11:30]  Yes.  Wow.  She'll never, uh...  I wonder if she was wearing something that the fucking set the lion off.  Um, oh boy.  There's a whole lot of people with it.  Let me go back.  Maybe you ought to put, like, that name and then...  Eaten by the lion.  And then, yeah.  Intern that was eaten by the lion.  Maybe you could whittle down the...  It's by...  Yeah.  Well, no, we haven't whittled enough of it.  Because a picture of Snoop Dogg is coming up.  Because he's now known as Snoop Lion or something.  Yeah, that's Snoop Lion. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, all right.  Let's keep going.  Well, you're not putting it in, uh...  You have to put it in quotes, certain things.  Oh, there she is.  Is that her?  Wait a minute.  She looks better in the other picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm petting a lion.  I like to pet a lion.  I'm not as bothered.  Petting some leopards.  I am bothered when hot people die.  She looked good in the other pic.  What happened?  Leopards could fuck you up pretty good.  Oh, man.  Leopards, you think?  Look at this picture.  Uh-oh.  Oh, jeez.  It's an animal.  It looks like a wolf or something, though.  And the mouth's open.  And she's sticking her arm in the mouth and pretending to be bitten.  Practice.  And in a lot of pain. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, boy.  Is that her husband with her?  Uh...  No, it's her...  Just another dork that thinks he can live among the animals.  Yeah.  It's her dad, I think.  Animal people are stupid.  You gotta respect that shit.  Is that her?  Yeah.  All right, zoom in.  You gotta respect that shit.  Let's see what she looks like there.  She's with a giant fucking tiger.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That lion behind her is like, yeah, you get in this fucking pen.  I know.  That's like watching a steak talk to somebody. 
[02:13:00]  Maybe we could get the XM Photoshop guy to Photoshop some boobs on her, first of all.  Oh, Jesus.  And maybe shave down her legs a little bit.  Oh, boy.  And take away the man nose.  I thought she was there.  Probably the lion did that for us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's all right.  Well, she's not all right.  She's...  She's a lot worse now.  Yes.  God, that's good.  I wonder what moment you know, like...  Oh, that you're in big trouble?  Yeah.  Like, does the lion get frisky at first?  Like, oh, throw a paw at you? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  You're like, oh.  Wait, hey, now.  Calm down.  Hey, hey.  They start that yelling, like, hey, hey, because you're going to, you know, show that you're  superior by yelling at it.  When do you just become screaming victim?  Like, when do you go from in control...  Hey, hey, hey.  Ow!  Yeah, yeah.  Help!  I'm being eaten.  What is that?  And what would your move be?  Do you curl up?  Do you think that will help if you play dead?  No, you've got to, like, fight right to the end.  Like, what would your move be, though?  That is so not a UFO.  I think you're so panicked. 
[02:14:00]  I know.  You could see the reflection.  I think you're just so panicked that you don't have a move.  We've talked about a cat getting at you with the back legs.  Yeah, yeah.  Now imagine a lion doing the exact same fucking thing.  A lion doing that.  Fucking grabs you at the front legs, bites you, and then takes those back legs and goes  shunk, shunk, just ripping chunks out of you.  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  Bites your neck.  Imagine your neck being bitten with lion breath.  Was it a female or a male lion?  It's a lion or a lioness.  I think your only move is to try to either finger it or fucking jerk it off and hope that 
[02:14:30]  sexual shit changes its chemistry real fast.  Oh, my God.  Imagine if he used to start tugging his dick and it rolled off and just was like a big  kid.  But then you try to let go and walk away and it gets all mad and you're just stuck jerking  the thing off for hours until someone comes and gets you.  Would you turn off a lion to save your life?  You'd have to.  But you don't let it come, though.  But now is that gay?  Yeah, you've got to edge it.  Because then it'll be hungry after it comes.  Yeah.  Is that gay, though?  No, not if you're...  I would say who gives a fuck at that point. 
[02:15:00]  Not if you're saving your life.  Right.  They gave the lion a cute name.  Oh, what's the name?  Well, you know what name she was screaming as it was killing her?  What?  Couscous.  Oh, I heard this.  Yeah.  No, couscous.  Couscous.  Couscous.  Oh, boy.  So what?  It just jumped on her?  They don't say anything?  No, they don't give any real details, but maybe she was in there.  She got in the cage to feed it or something.  He was like, I'll eat you.  I know it's a goofy line, but can we get an animal expert on?  I want to know if you try to turn it on sexually as it's mauling you, if that could give you a fighting chance. 
[02:15:30]  I'm being serious.  So it'll reach around?  I bet it would think you're fucking trying to rip its balls off.  Yeah.  You think it'd just make it way worse?  The lion has never been jerked off.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't do it to themselves.  A lion has never had its cocks sucked.  Lions don't suck each other's cocks.  No.  Wouldn't know what you were doing.  He'd think you're biting his prick.  Yeah.  I'm not sucking him off.  I'm just going to fucking...  You're just going to give him a handy? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, I'm going to jerk off the lion.  What if his fucking big balls were by your face and that fucking dick was there?  You've got to suck it a little.  You wanted to say delicious.  No, but yeah.  You wanted to say delicious.  Of course.  Wow.  It's a hell of a way to go.  Yeah.  The lion smelled her aroma.  He said, I can smell your cock.  Oh.  Kevin in Philly just came out.  She was wearing Lady Gaga's meat suit.  Oh, see.  Not good.  It's a nice timely reference. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Jesus.  I think Lady Gaga already ate Lady Gaga's meat suit.  Yeah.  What else?  What else is she fucking wearing?  Oof.  Yeah.  What?  Where do you go with that, Jeff?  Can we check out the Indiana University video?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's that one about?  I think we're done with the lion thing.  It's such a tragic story.  Terrible, man.  Horrible.  Just awful.  This kid, he goes to Indiana University.  Yep.  And I think it was last night or two nights ago, he posted a video on his Facebook page  called, Why I'd Hate to Be Asian, parentheses, Totally Not Racist. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  He's since been accused of racism, and he's taken the video off of his Facebook page.  Why?  Well, you want to just listen to the video?  Sure.  Well, we can listen.  He said it wasn't racist.  He said, in parentheses, this is totally not racist.  Totally.  Well, if you say it, then it's fine.  Stop playing, Sam.  You're breaking everything.  Sam.  Everybody in the world, all the boys and girls, this is a little segment I like to call, Why 
[02:17:30]  I'd Hate to Be Asian.  People are stupid.  I got a list today when I was sitting at work, and it goes a little something like this.  Oh, okay.  Reason number one that I would hate to be Asian.  Most Asians look alike. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, boy.  It's going to be trouble.  It's not even clever.  No.  I don't want to look like everyone else.  If I looked like my brother, my cousin, my uncle, not even that.  If I looked like Frank down the street, guess what?  Maybe I don't like how Frank down the street looks.  Why is she doing that?  You know what?  Holy shit.  He's fucking killing.  Reason number two.  If I was an Asian man, chances are I'd probably be with an Asian woman. 
[02:18:30]  And guess what?  I don't find Asian women attractive.  Kill me.  Reason number three.  Sweatshops.  They suck.  I'm totally against them.  He's terrible.  He's trying to be funny.  He's fucking great.  You know how much work goes into a sweatshop?  He's trying to be funny.  Hit pause.  You know what I would say?  Oh, oh, Chipper.  Because your pecker's small.  Ah.  Wow.  I bet that comes up.  You have a small pecker.  I bet that comes up, Chipper.  This kid is just a jock who desperately wants to be funny. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you can see.  And he looks like every other college jock.  Yeah.  White college jocks.  He's looking alike.  Right.  He looks like every other college douche.  He's looking the part.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A white college jock guy.  Yeah.  But he badly wants to be funny and wants to have something to say.  Right.  He thinks, like, people are going to watch this and laugh and be like, oh, God, it's funny,  but, oh, it's a little edgy.  Yeah.  But it's true.  That's it.  Hey, you know, you're saying the things we all think.  Oh, boy. 
[02:19:30]  He's Carlin in his mind.  Oh, he is.  Yes.  Oh, damn.  I miss Carlin, so this could be good.  Yeah.  It gets better.  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  Actually, twice I worked in a factory.  That's nothing near a sweatshop.  I bet he date rapes.  He looks like a date rapist.  Yep.  Asians.  Yeah.  Pot smoking.  Could you imagine how you would look if you were a high Asian? 
[02:20:00]  Okay.  Is this good stuff, Jim?  It's called chinkai.  Fuck it.  Right.  Hilarious.  What if you already have chinkai?  Double chinkai?  That's his clothes?  Ah, this guy's hilarious.  Fucking guy's great.  This guy.  Holy fuck is this bad.  It's, uh.  You guys are crazy.  So why don't you take it down?  Because obviously he's trying to be funny.  Ah, could I?  When I heard about this video, I thought.  It's a good one.  I thought he was just being, you know, just trying to throw some hate out there.  But he's actually trying to be funny. 
[02:20:30]  Uh, his apology was.  First, he tweeted out, uh.  I'd like to apologize to the Asian community for my video.  Why I'd hate to be Asian.  I do not hate Asians, nor am I racist.  It was a joke.  Hashtag, yup.  And then he posted, after he removed the video, he posted on his Facebook.  I would like to really apologize to the entire Asian race.  Oh.  And anyone else offended by my video.  What I did was a joke.  But was not taken as one.  With that being said, I sincerely am sorry for offending anyone. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, I hear he's trying for the jokes.  I'm offended because it's horrendous.  It's so badly.  You know what he said about pot smoking?  What?  Fucking good one.  Oh, I heard that, yeah.  Getting zooled.  Yeah, yeah.  He said double chink, guys.  Fuck it, dude.  Fuck, you had to stop the video.  You were cracking up.  Yeah.  My mother would love this.  How does he do double chink?  Double gun.  There it is.  Double chink, guys.  Fuck, yeah.  This guy knows.  It's funny.  All right, keep going.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  That's how it feels, I guess.  Number five.  Timing.  Math.  Math?  I suck at math.  I'm told, I'm not good at math.  Oh.  I was in algebra.  I don't even know what it's called.  Algebra help.  But Mr. Scott, my senior year, taught me to graduate.  That's serious.  Number six.  Show business. 
[02:22:00]  If you're an Asian man, the only way that you're going to be in show business for the  most part is if you know kung fu or you try out for a part to be an Asian mobster.  What?  That stinks.  Holy fuck, is this bad?  Number six.  Number seven.  Being short.  I mean, that stinks.  I'm not the tallest guy. 
[02:22:30]  No, you look like a little sort of runt.  About 5'11".  I went to the doctor.  5'11 and a half.  You know what that means?  I'll never hit six foot.  I was going to hit like a massive growth spurt, which would be awesome.  Then I'd be definitely looking down at the Asians like, told you so.  Holy fuck.  It's fucking hilarious.  It's just, you like it, Chip?  Fuck yeah.  Is this guy funny?  Fuck yeah, you're going to be six feet fucking double guy. 
[02:23:00]  Would you see this guy in a comedy club?  Fuck yeah, this guy's probably doing a bunch of shows or something.  Yeah?  It's fucking hilarious.  Suck, sucker.  My mother loves humor like this.  Humor.  Do observational humor, Chipper.  Yeah?  Even if it's racial, your mom doesn't mind that?  She don't give a fuck.  She goes, if it's funny, just do it.  That's true.  But the problem is, it's not funny.  It's fucking hilarious.  This guy's good.  He's like slow, like Stephen Wright or something.  Yeah, just like him. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Let's catch a little more of the comedy stylings of Douchebag.  I totally hate sushi.  Sushi, sushi.  And guess what?  It would be everywhere if I were Asian.  It would be everywhere.  Hey, you're oriental.  You want some sushi?  I can't even say it.  That's how awful it is.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Number eight. 
[02:24:00]  Asian males.  They don't have a good rep.  Oh, shit.  Stay on your joke.  Schools don't accept them any more than the white males.  You know, they're not known for being great in the bedroom.  Asian women are.  Asian males.  I know for being smaller.  See, I said that before.  They got small peckers.  Small peckers?  Yeah.  Fuck, yeah.  This guy knows good comedy.  He's fucking...  You're on his same, like, wavelength there. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, this guy.  We should work together or something.  Oh, that'd be great.  Do a podcast.  A podcast.  A podcast.  And he wrote this.  He actually wrote this.  This is written.  Yes, it's written down.  You can just see him glance at this list.  You see his eyes go down.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What a douche.  Imagine writing.  But he said this stuff to people expecting laughs.  No kidding.  He thought this was going to take over the internet.  This is a hoot.  Well, it did.  Well, it did.  Yeah, it did.  It's viral.  It's the worst part of the internet that this stuff that, like, when you're a kid that 
[02:25:00]  you did thinking was funny, like, this is never going away.  Right.  All right.  Keep going.  We're just about done.  Done.  Was that going to attract a woman?  I don't think so.  Well, those really, those tighty-whities really fit him great.  I can't wear tighty-whities.  And last but not least.  How come he can't wear tighty-whities?  I bet he's got a real big fucking cock.  Jeez.  That's not even a joke.  You didn't even think we would.  It sounded like he got turned on a little bit. 
[02:25:30]  No, I didn't.  I'm just saying he can't wear tighty-whities because fucking cock's bulging.  Jesus.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Who cares?  Are you serious?  It's called porn for a reason.  Why are you going to go blur stuff?  Who does that?  And that just ends?  And that stops there.  Who does that is what it ends with?  Uh-huh.  So what?  Oh, they're porn.  They blur out the genitals, whatever.  That's good stuff, man. 
[02:26:00]  Was that worth Gawker's time to post that?  Some dumb college student makes a video.  I guess they just...  Well, why was that worth posting?  It's not news.  I don't know.  They want to get him in trouble.  Everybody likes to accuse somebody of racism.  That's true.  They like getting him in trouble.  He's not...  Eh, whatever.  He's trying to be a comedian.  Right.  Which is very different than trying to...  You know, than being a racist.  No, but...  Yeah, but you could accuse him of racism.  Right.  Yeah, but that's the...  All these websites just love to be able to accuse someone of racism.  Yeah, but they're way off on this one. 
[02:26:30]  They always are.  It's obvious the guy's trying to do a set.  Yeah.  It failed miserably.  Horribly.  Yeah, they just love to be able to accuse someone of something.  Right.  Look at how outrageous this is.  Right.  This passes for humor?  Right.  Oh, boy.  All right.  We're going to talk to Daryl Hammond in a few minutes.  Oh, no.  He's coming in a little later?  I thought it was 9 o'clock.  Is it 9 or 9.30?  Is it 9 or 9.30?  Is it 9 or 9.30, Iraq?  My sheet says 9.30.  Mine says 9. 
[02:27:00]  My sheet says 9 and 9.30.  I sent out an email that said we should not have him at 9.30 and Don King at 9.40 if we're doing that.  Right.  Is Don King coming in today?  Is Don King coming in today?  Is Don King coming in today?  Where's Don King?  Iraq, is Don King coming in today?  What time is Don King here?  Comment.  When, Iraq?  Why don't we have that information?  Yeah.  Where's Roland?  Roland!  What are we, just whistling Dixie?  Right.  Daryl's scheduled for 9, but he's not here yet.  Okay.  Scheduled for 9, not here yet.  I have Daryl Hammond in studio at 9.30 a.m. 
[02:27:30]  I got Daryl Hammond in studio at 9, but over here I have in studio at 9.30.  Yeah.  I have 9, but then Don King was a maybe for 9.40.  Right.  But then they also said Daryl Hammond at 9.30.  So we have a 10-minute differential.  Don King's a big fan of Chavez, too.  It's in the paper today.  It made everyone feel extremely awkward.  Yeah.  He wanted like a 10 count, I guess, at some kind of boxing function.  Moment of silence or something?  I don't know.  I think it's where they ring the bell 10 times dramatically. 
[02:28:00]  That commie fuck.  And he wanted to do it for Chavez.  And everyone's looking at Don King going, what the fuck's wrong with you?  Yeah, we hate Chavez.  Chavez.  He's a fan of the Chavez.  We found another guy.  So it's Sean Penn and Don King, it looks like.  Yeah.  Sean Penn.  That fucking guy.  I'm so wasted.  I wish he wasn't a good actor.  He's great.  He's fucking so annoying.  A little bitch.  Oh, Star Trek shit.  The future.  I'm supposed to turn that off in the studio. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  We're going to play with our puds and figure out when Daryl Hammond is going to be in here.  And you do what you got to do.  And we'll meet back here in a few minutes.  All right?  All right.  All right, then.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  On today's show, Tyra Banks.  Um, I like trannies.  Oh, my God. 
[02:29:00]  I like trannies, too.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Got Daryl Hammond outside the studio.  He's just sitting there.  Big star like him.  Where is he?  A big star.  A big star.  He's playing Carolines this weekend.  Olive oil voice and guinea charm.  That's right.  Yo, Daryl.  Looking his way in.  Hello.  I'm done.  Hello. 
[02:29:30]  There he is.  Daryl Hammond.  How are you, sir?  Sir.  Fuzzy Dunlap, at your pleasure.  How are you?  Take a seat.  I'm doing by Fuzzy Dunlap today.  It's from The Wire.  Remember, Herc, he kept saying he had a confidential informant.  Yeah, Fuzzy Dunlap is his name.  Oh, right, right, right.  Fuzzy Dunlap.  Yeah, I got this from Fuzzy Dunlap.  You know, Steve Earle is in today.  He's doing another interview.  Oh, don't get it.  I never knew he was a singer. 
[02:30:00]  He played Bubz's sponsor on The Wire.  I know.  I never knew he was a fucking singer.  Oh, right, that guy.  I knew he was a singer.  I didn't know he was such a great actor.  He usually goes over to the Beacon Theater and play with the Allman Brothers who are in  town.  The Manson hedge fund volume.  Yeah, that's all right.  For the love of God.  Yeah.  Oh, here we go.  We're on.  There it is.  There they ain't none of you.  Cha-cha.  Yeah, we're working.  It does.  Yeah.  What's going on in Daryl Hammond's life? 
[02:30:30]  Well, there's this dude, D.A. Pennebaker, you know?  Uh-huh.  He's a documentary maker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Making a little documentary of me.  What is...  He should be on stage this weekend at Caroline's playing Fuzzy Dunlap.  Fuck, I love Caroline's.  Yeah.  The place is great.  It is great.  It is.  It's like the best club on the planet.  They just fucking...  Isn't it like consistently rated number one in the country or something like that?  It's gotta be.  Yeah, I think so.  It's at the crossroads of the world, you know.  It's a little dramatic, the intro.  50th and Broadway.  Look, it's a nice room, all right? 
[02:31:00]  Exactly.  Do they still do that whole thing?  Oh, yeah, they do.  At the crossroads of the world.  It's a little must.  The divine spark mentioned in the Bible.  It's a great club.  Here from Leviticus.  Yeah, they just hooked me up.  That's why I say it's a great place.  What's the documentary gonna be about, though?  About that book I wrote?  Yeah.  Oh, right on.  Stuff like that.  I wasn't here for the big book interview.  No.  And I read your book, and I loved it.  Thank you.  I might know a thing or two about some crazies. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  But you wanna hear that thing?  No, man.  I was excited.  I read the whole book, because, you know, I probably could relate to a few of those things.  The mother things.  I had a mother thing, too.  Have you taken a couple of wrong roads, my friend?  Is that what it was?  A couple of wrong roads?  I didn't do one party too many.  The only question I have about the book, even though it's, uh, why weren't there more  stories about your mom in the book?  You kind of, like, uh, hinted towards...  Because I got hit by a car.  I was in a car accident, and HarperCollins wanted to finish the book, and there were like 
[02:32:00]  a hundred pages of notes.  Is that really it?  Is that really it?  That's absolutely it.  They were like, no, we have a deadline.  We wanna be for the Christmas holidays.  I'm like, I'm laid up.  I got hit head on by a car in Long Island.  I mean, I was hit a passenger in a car.  Right, yeah.  A car coming toward us hit us head on at about 65, I think, the newspaper said.  Holy shit.  So I, I wasn't able to finish it, so they just wrapped it up.  Oh my God.  You guys never got this at all.  Yeah.  Because the book still is really good.  Thank you. 
[02:32:30]  But I got, I got kind of mad.  I'm like, I know he's got a few...  Tons of dialogue about my mom.  Okay, right.  Tons of stuff about her.  But then I'm thinking you were holding it back for a second book.  No.  Going, if the first one goes good, I'm gonna give you some shit.  No, I know.  Some good shit for the second.  No, it was, I was all scribbled down on a piece of...  What kind of notes did they give you?  Because I, I, I, my book was different, so it wasn't like as biographical as yours.  What were they saying?  Like, fix this story, or don't tell this one, or...  Um, well, first of all, I, I wrote probably, I don't know how, the book is 250 pages or something, 
[02:33:00]  and I wrote probably 800, they brought in this young lady, a young writer, a beautiful writer  named Liz Stein, who, and she like turned it into a book, you know, 280 pages.  Yeah, they have to edit certain stories and a consistency and stuff like that, but...  So why don't we just say, uh, you were on SNL.  Okay, now we'll move on to...  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Hold the phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, I mean, they, I just would hand the stuff in, and then I was in the accident, and 
[02:33:30]  I wasn't really able to do anything for a couple of months, so...  You were really that laid up, huh?  What were your injuries?  Um, most, bruised, internal organs, cracked ribs, dislocated stuff, uh, meat, uh, hern disc,  uh...  Wow.  Damn.  They cut you out of the car?  No, they didn't cut me out of the car.  I let, I let myself out of the car.  You did?  Yes, I did, because I thought it was going to explode.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you don't want to be part of that.  Yeah.  I thought that, I was like, well, in the movies, the car always explodes. 
[02:34:00]  That's true.  I kind of think that could happen.  You don't want that.  So I know, I did manage to get out, yeah.  Man.  And it's so interesting, because it hurt then, and I remember lying on the pavement going,  I, I guess you could die from the...  Wow.  Yeah.  From hurting this bad.  That wasn't half of what it became in two weeks.  Holy shit.  When my organs started to swell, you know?  Like, my, all my organs started getting large, and it looked like I had a rope underneath 
[02:34:30]  my skin.  Wow.  Holy gee.  It takes two weeks for that to happen?  I would say two weeks to a month before I really...  Oh, wow.  I mean, look at it, I was on OxyContin.  I might have the time off.  Oh.  It was an hour.  I mean, the guy's like, I'm going to give you OxyContin.  OxyCodone.  I'm like, really?  Oh, right.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  Oh, that's an excuse.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the terrible thing about having that much pain, though.  It just kind of takes it away. 
[02:35:00]  You don't, like, get high.  It just does what it's supposed to do.  It just makes you...  Yeah, it makes it so that you can go to the bathroom a little bit for a while.  So what you...  You guys were stopped at a stoplight, and the car was coming down the other lane?  We were actually turning, we were in a lane, turning left, and the car was coming towards  us, and the person driving me turned into the oncoming car.  Oh, and that's, like, hello to your side right there.  Yeah, and I got hit.  It hit the right corner. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that was beautiful.  Did you have a belt on?  I had a seatbelt on, but it was the airbag that saved me, but also caused the injuries,  but it kept me alive.  Yeah, yeah.  Without that airbag, you were dead?  Splattered.  Oh, wow.  Splattered all over the pavement, the windshield, yeah.  That's fucking crazy.  It's fucking horrifying.  And you remember it?  Like, did you see...  I almost had an accident once, and it's weird how it unfolded in slow motion.  Did you see it, or just all of a sudden you felt it?  I was reading my script, because I was in a play on Long Island.  I was going to the show, and the driver screamed, 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my God!  Like that, and I was like, really?  What?  Oh.  Wow.  And then it was glass and steel.  Oh, that's terrible.  Do you hang out with that person?  I also said, oh, my God.  Really?  You know, you think you're going to say something really cool, like, at death's door.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to have something to say, like, damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.  You don't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Shit.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Do you hang out with that person anymore?  I do.  Okay.  You aren't mad?  Huh?  You aren't mad at them?  I was for a long time.  Oh, okay.  I would assume.  It was a mistake.  Big, big bug mistake.  Wow.  Big mistake.  Yeah, it's a big mistake.  So now they're going to make the book into a documentary, kind of?  Kind of like that, yeah.  Sort of?  Yeah.  I mean, I got discovered, so to speak, at Caroline, so I guess that's the angle.  Is it just your stand-up, or are they talking to you offstage and just kind of intersplicing?  They'll film stand-up and offstage, and then there's a couple guys in the book, Eddie the 
[02:37:00]  cop, that was so prominent in the second half of the book, is coming, and it's going to be  pretty cool.  Are you doing a, there's always a paperback edition.  Has that come out yet?  I had a paperback, but Hurricane Sandy came, and all 12 interviews got canceled.  And it's really hard to get Charlie Rose back.  Wow.  You really, um.  Charlie Rose.  Like, I was supposed to make my money on the paperback.  Yeah.  I didn't make nothing on the hard copy, but I had a nice deal that if it ever made it  the paperback, I'd make a couple of bucks. 
[02:37:30]  Hurricane Sandy came, all 12 interviews canceled.  Oh my gosh.  Someone didn't want this book out.  Well, look what you, what was your original title?  If there's a God up there, I'm fucked?  Yeah.  No, God, if you're not up there, I'm fucked.  Oh.  And it's interesting to me because I, I was raising money for, uh, special needs kids  in Monroe, Louisiana, which, I mean, they paid me a nominal fee, and don't get me wrong,  but I, I, I was doing that.  So they said, you know, maybe he should do a book signing.  Now, remember God and Funk in the same title. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  It was blasphemous, one of the commandments.  We're in the Bible Belt.  I signed no copies of my book in four hours.  I signed almost 50 copies of Fifty Shades of Grey.  Wait.  Absolutely a true story.  You were sitting in this book signing.  No one wanted to sign my, no one wanted my smut on their coffee table.  You didn't, did no one show up for the signing?  They were there, but they were there for Fifty Shades of Grey.  They didn't want my book.  That's right.  And they, and they wanted me to sign Fifty Shades of Grey. 
[02:38:30]  How awful was it?  Which is really strange.  Huh?  Sitting there with no one, I've had a few slow signings, too.  Where you, where you start talking to the person.  You sign a long autograph.  Hey, Frank, thanks for coming.  You know, you really like the details.  Yeah, I remember a few of those things.  It's looking at me.  We've had a few of those.  Yeah, it was kind of silly.  And I, I had, I had tried to say, you know, it's in the United States, in a Judeo-Christian  society, you, you can make fun of a member of the flock, but not the flock.  And to the flock, the Ten Commandments is the flock.  Yeah.  And you can't do that. 
[02:39:00]  And so that was blasphemed on the cover.  I mean, you know, I couldn't get into Target with my book.  I couldn't get into the airports.  I couldn't get into, uh, uh, Walmart, which is kind of if you're selling a hardcover.  Did anybody tell you, like, hey, maybe you should.  No.  No, no one told me.  Change the title.  Because you would have changed the title.  Of course.  I didn't want that stupid title.  Oh, my God.  So it hurts you, and it wasn't even something you needed.  I didn't care less about that damn title.  I was in jail in the Caribbean, and I couldn't think of nothing.  I, I wanted to pray.  I was so scared. 
[02:39:30]  I was like, maybe praying, maybe that sort of stuff works.  And I was like, maybe there's a God, and I'm hoping there's a God.  And that Caribbean story was frightening.  You know, and I was like, I guess if there's not a God, I'm in a lot of trouble.  In a manner of speaking, I'm fucked.  That's a good title.  And then I put that in the transcript, like, there's your title.  And I'm like, really?  Because I know in stand-up, if you offend Moses or any of the leaders of the movement that your show's over, that just doesn't pertain to books? 
[02:40:00]  Oh, wow.  Whatever.  Who came up with the title?  Was it someone in the company?  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, it was weird.  They should have known better, especially if they wanted to get you in the airports and all these other places.  Well, they didn't want to.  I think they wanted to sell it online.  It became a bestseller online.  Did it really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it did.  But that's because of Dr. Phil, actually.  Oh, you did do something with Dr. Phil, right?  Yeah, I mean, he plugged it so hard it became a bestseller, yeah. 
[02:40:30]  I mean, it would not have been anything without him.  See, I always disliked Dr. Phil, but I guess if he takes care of you and if he did the right thing by you.  Yeah, I don't know him that well.  I think he's very colorful and interesting, but I mean, he likes the book and he had me on and all of a sudden it's all it takes.  Not that I made any money.  Did they say to you too much mother stuff?  Was that one of the notes they gave you?  No.  No?  They wanted more mothers.  That's the reason. 
[02:41:00]  The reason for the book was my mom.  Okay.  That was the interesting thing.  And also Saturday Night Live.  Yeah.  It's just they had a deadline and thankfully I have this brilliant young writer named Liz Stein.  I was like, I can imitate your writing.  And she did.  She finished it, yeah.  Wow.  So you had a stroke of bad luck and good luck.  The fact that what's finished was lucky because you could have been killed.  But the fact that bad luck was the timing at the end and the fucking paperback.  That stuff happens, right?  Yeah, it stinks though. 
[02:41:30]  Fucking the paperback is worse.  The fact that you didn't get it.  Oh, Hurricane Sandy, yeah.  So it was released, but no one knew it was out, right?  Right.  Couldn't you do a second push a few weeks later?  I mean, I know it's not the same, but...  You can't get Charlie Rose again.  Oh.  I mean, really?  Aaron Burnett, no.  CNN, no.  Yeah.  I mean, no.  They're already booked.  It's too late.  They've moved on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I know that Barnes & Noble had the...  I was very happy they put me in noteworthy nonfiction, but nobody paid any attention to it. 
[02:42:00]  Was it the same title?  No.  We renamed it God, if you're not up there, dot, dot, dot.  Which for the people, like, what the hell is that?  I mean, no one knows what the hell is that.  Yeah, that is a little vague.  Yeah.  Do you add any material to it?  Huh?  Was there any new material in the paperback?  No, they didn't want any.  They were like, please, really?  Work?  You've got to be out of your mind.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Because there was some stories that needed to be told. 
[02:42:30]  Because that's the selling point for a paperback is when there's a little additional material.  There was a hundred pages of handwritten notes, but stuff that will make it into...  I mean, if it's ever...  Like, I've been to meetings.  You know, you probably go to meetings where they talk about adapting it for other media,  right?  Yeah.  You go to those, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wink, wink.  Yeah, sure, pal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, now, you could always put that in a documentary, though.  I mean, you're doing a documentary.  That would be an interesting...  The documentary wouldn't be just telling the exact same stories in the book. 
[02:43:00]  You'll have some extra stories, which would make it interesting.  It will tell the chair story.  I mean, how this great doctor had me use these two chairs to find out what was inside my head  and why I was cutting myself.  Yeah.  That's an interesting concept of...  Yeah, it should have been in the book, but it ain't.  Did it work?  Was it accurate?  Well, why was I doing something and I didn't really know why I was doing it, and why was  I doing it for years?  I didn't know why I had these things locked up in my head, and he used these two chairs.  Good angel, bad angel, he had me play my mom. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, man.  You would sit in one chair and be your mom, and the other chair would be yourself?  Yes.  And would you move back and forth?  Yes, yes, yes.  You moved from chair to chair, yeah.  Did it feel silly at first, and then all of a sudden it resonated?  It broke, like, within 30 seconds, it broke.  Yeah.  It worked.  Like, he goes, sit in the chair, and now say this.  Mom, I have a lot of problems.  You never answer for this.  Now go over here and play your mom. 
[02:44:00]  Answer for what?  But I answer for the fact that, look, I don't know anything about that blood.  Oh, shit.  And then you're like, wow.  And then you're like, you know everything about it, you were there.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, the guy's like a genius.  That is like, just to conjure up the image of that actually happening, is frightening.  Yeah, but, I mean, great doctors can do stuff like that.  You know, the thing about these great trauma doctors is that they can get up in your head 
[02:44:30]  and not make it worse, you know?  Like, find out what's going on in there.  Why do you keep doing this stuff?  Yeah.  You know, and not hurt you, actually injure you.  Like, they unlock the door and let it seep out without letting it fucking just wreck the  rest of what's in there.  Absolutely.  Like, lancing a wound or something like that.  But there are not that many of them.  I mean, trauma therapy is still sort of in its infancy.  But there are a couple of, I mean, this guy had me, I was locked up upstate for three  months.  I mean, he didn't like do it the first day.  Right, right, right. 
[02:45:00]  You know?  How do you know when something like that's happening, though, that you're not, and, I mean,  maybe it makes, how do you know that you're not creating something in that moment as opposed  to bringing back something that really happens?  Like, what in your mind tells you, no, this is actually genuine?  I think when your snot starts coming out of your nose, you start bawling and sputtering  and, yeah.  Is it like, oh, my God, I forgot?  Like, can you, do you have things where you're like, I can't believe I forgot that?  Yes. 
[02:45:30]  Absolutely.  Because I, you know, I had the world's best mom.  That's what they called her.  World's best mom.  Sang in the choir, quoted verses, a counselor, a spiritual advisor to the community.  And then when people's backs were turned, she was doing crimes against nature.  Jesus.  But that's what predators do.  I mean, they create a front.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Like, oh, look at that.  I mean, like all the great predators had a great front.  And it's usually church or civic groups or national pride or something like that. 
[02:46:00]  What was her motivation for being so, I guess, cruel?  She was abused, too.  Okay.  Hideously.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Gee.  Yeah.  Wow.  She told you.  Some people are able to, like, turn that around, aren't they?  Like, make it like, okay, I was abused, so I will never abuse.  Well, you know, it's a difference in degree.  A difference in degree, but in essence, it's the same thing.  I mean, you can push a person into, you know, like me, I become a cutter and a drinker and 
[02:46:30]  my mother, you know, and they're do well.  Mm-hmm.  And then someone gets pushed farther than I got pushed, you know, they become like a  bona fide sociopath.  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  Do you ever think you had the potential of going over the line?  I think we all do.  And just becoming a serial killer that bad?  We could all, I believe, if you give us, don't you think?  Oh, of course.  If you give us the right circumstances, we could all be something that we'd be ashamed of. 
[02:47:00]  Listening to Daryl's voice right now.  Like this show.  Yeah.  I'd like to be something I'm not.  But just listening to you, it's like, and with your, Daryl's wearing sunglasses and very  relaxed and calm, and it's like, I could picture this as a prison interview by somebody who  had done horrific things.  Like, it's the same, like, you know, well, this is what happens.  It's just all calm, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, my dad was a great, he was a soldier and he, you know, being all that  stuff people can see in combat, he had post-traumatic stress. 
[02:47:30]  That ain't the same thing as what my mom was.  You know what I'm saying?  And near the end of his life, he was all confused.  He had cancer and I brought this cop down from New York, this great dude, this great cop  I knew, still a pal of mine, and he had to sit down with my dad in the last month of  his life and explain to him, because my dad was confused.  First of all, he's on fentanyl, which is stronger than morphine.  He's got a month or two to live.  He's confused and being eaten up by cancer. 
[02:48:00]  So I brought this pal down, and I remember they were out in the yard, and my father goes,  I wonder if I can hand me a drink.  He's got a month to live.  My friend's like, have a drink, Max.  Have a drink, friend.  Let me make you a drink.  Say, make him a drink.  I've watched them out in the yard, and they're having martinis, and, you know, this guy's  gesturing, like, and I opened the door once, and I heard him say, because, Max, they made  furniture out of people. 
[02:48:30]  Holy shit.  They made chairs.  Because it's not like a Korean guy fighting for his country, or a French guy fighting for  his country, or anyone fighting.  These guys made chairs out of people, Max.  They had to go.  You understand?  God loves you for doing that.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, he's probably feeling some guilt over some stuff, and we don't want to do it.  Well, I think it's, you know, probably didn't take every prisoner that he might have.  I mean, really, after you see, like, what these guys do, like, maybe you get war, you're 
[02:49:00]  like, maybe I don't want to take it.  And then I guess when you start getting to that point in life where you're seeing the end  of the road there, you start thinking, uh-oh.  Was I right to do that?  Maybe.  Shouldn't I have put that guy in trial instead of shooting him, you know?  Right, right.  But, but they were, you know, it's really sad, but they were bad guys.  They had to go.  They had to go.  They made furniture out of these people.  Yeah, Max, they made furniture out of people.  That's so fucked up thing to hear when you fling the door open. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, he's like, there's a lot of types of cruelty in this world, Max.  I mean, you understand?  I mean, like, in unintentional cruelty, you say something to your daughter, your son, you  go back and you apologize, you make it better.  But then there's a kind of cruelty on fun, uh, on purpose and for fun, Max.  You understand?  On purpose and for fun.  You understand?  Intentional.  You know what I'm saying?  These guys made chairs.  They made linen out of people and kids.  You understand? 
[02:50:00]  You know, like that.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Killed you son of a bitch.  Straight shooter.  That's all.  Shoot him.  That's all.  You can't talk to these son of a bitches.  Did you have any resentment against your dad for not stepping in?  Yes.  For a long time.  God, you're talking my fucking story.  And, you know.  We gotta go get coffee, Darrell.  And then, you know.  Because you wonder why I gotta jump in.  All this craziness is going on in the house and you wonder why, like, yo, pops, get off the  couch and figure this shit out.  You're the one with the normal brain here. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  What do you think that was about?  Because I know in my own life I have let my pain, my anger get in the way of doing what  I knew to be right because I was too absorbed, too concerned with my own pain and my own rage.  Right.  And I regret it deeply.  He did at the end of his life and was able to say so to me.  And that was intense, man.  And good.  And real good. 
[02:51:00]  What did he tell you?  I'm sorry.  I guess I wasn't.  I was just a soldier.  Hmm.  Wow.  Sometimes it's just easier.  I was like, yeah.  I know my dad.  I get it now.  I get it.  You know.  They played taps at the funeral.  I was very proud.  Wow.  Sure.  I know my dad didn't pipe up because it was easier because all hell would go toward him.  Yeah.  It's not that easy, friend.  I mean.  No, man.  I'm one of seven kids.  So I'm sure my dad's thinking, well, fuck, if I act up here and try to do the right thing,  I might be stuck raising the seven kids alone here. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  They got their own shit they got to worry about.  Yeah.  Life happens on you and sometimes you're not wired.  I mean, I know I wasn't wired to do what I wanted to do in the world.  And I have a lot to learn and I still do.  Wow.  You know what I'm saying.  But now here's all Sharpton.  You know, when I was a kid, I grew up in Brooklyn.  I would come home from school and my mother would make blueberry pie.  I mean, you know, you got to pull out a voice. 
[02:52:00]  I was about to write a hand out.  I have actual nooses in my bag.  Anybody want to hang themselves?  Because I brought nooses or I'll do it.  We've been making fun of that blueberry pie.  And like, what were they thinking to allow that on TV?  He looks like a fucking clown.  I would sneak something with the pie.  My mother said you sneak pies.  I know I didn't sneak pie.  I would have blueberry all over my face.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  A weird little talent.  That's great.  Was it rough to be funny?  I mean, when you're on SNL and through your life doing stand-up  and stuff, with all that going on in your life,  was it a way to cut it off and not think about it?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  An escape is addictive, too.  Yeah.  I think you know what that's like when you're like,  the first time you walk out in front of 200 people  that you never met before and you make them laugh hard, 
[02:53:00]  you're like, you can get hooked on that.  It's like being a small Hitler.  Like, you're just controlling a room full of people.  Yeah.  I understand what being powerful is.  And they're like, you never met them before  and they're laughing at stuff that you thought of.  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Can I ask an impression question?  Yeah.  Which was the hardest one that you had to learn  that you just couldn't get at first?  I think that, you know, there was a big disagreement  on how to play Bush when they wanted me to play Bush  and I didn't have the same opinion that other people did 
[02:53:30]  at the time of him, you know.  And I didn't think of him as unintelligent.  I know there were verbal gaps and he made mistakes,  but I thought of him as a smart guy in an extraordinary circumstance  and he did make mistakes.  But, I mean, you know, he's not a natural actor, that guy.  Right.  You know, some guys just are not good for that presidential stuff.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  He's not a natural actor.  But, you know, that presidential, that pomp and circumstance stuff, 
[02:54:00]  that's not easy.  Yeah.  Clinton was good at it.  Clinton and Reagan was good at it.  Yeah, Reagan.  I don't think anyone has ever been better at the spoken word  than Reagan or Clinton.  Yeah, yeah.  Like Martin Luther King.  I'm, you know, but he wasn't a politician.  But in terms of politics, I mean, Clinton gave that last convention speech  using easily verifiable facts and figures, really heavy lifting.  If you're, you know, usually because when you're rallying the troops, 
[02:54:30]  it's like you have some slogan and a prearranged thing  and there are drinks and people cheer.  This guy walks out with easily verifiable facts and figures and rocked.  That was like a whole new, I mean, to me, that was like, you know,  it reminded me like the first time I saw Michael Jordan play basketball.  I'm like, wait, that's the standard now.  Now you've got to do that if you want to compete.  I mean, that's how good you've got to be.  And, you know, and Reagan was masterful.  I mean, when Reagan said, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall, 
[02:55:00]  he combined Sunday school teacher and F-16 fighter jack.  Like, really, really heavy lifting.  I mean, he wasn't kidding.  You look in that guy's eyes and see if he's kidding with you.  Right.  You know, Qaddafi found out he was not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a serious dude.  And part of being the president, I mean, I guess, is City Hall.  You've got to go out there and talk to the troops.  Yep. 
[02:55:30]  You know, you've got to give them speeches.  You've got to talk about why we love this country and all that stuff.  It's not easy.  It's very, very, very hard.  You know, and I always felt, like, weird, like, these guys trying to do this job,  and you're out there banging on them.  Just making fun of them.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, wow.  I mean, if you can imagine looking at a presidential daily briefing in the morning.  Really?  This is what I've got to do today?  Really?  I mean, really?  I mean, how many terrorist threats last night?  3,000?  And what bank closed? 
[02:56:00]  And what country's going, huh?  Because to me, if my easy pass doesn't work, I'm at the jumping off place.  You understand?  I'm coming in from Jersey.  If my easy pass doesn't work, and I'm just going to kick that car and go right into the river.  You know?  So, you've got to give them credit.  Some of that stuff's real hard.  So, they wanted you to play it dumb, and you felt that you could caricature him without making him a complete moron.  I didn't want to play him like that at all.  I wanted to play him, whatever he was, I wanted to discover it on my own. 
[02:56:30]  But Will Ferrell had made such a hit playing him that way, you know?  Oh, right.  I knew he was something else, and I wanted to get into that.  Well, you met him.  I mean, I know you performed for him.  Yeah.  And did you get to talk to him at all?  A little.  A little bit, you know?  I got a little bit of it.  I talked to Chaney more than him, but yeah.  How was he?  Impressive.  Yeah.  He's funny, charming.  Presidents can do that, man.  They're just amazing as far as being, like, charming. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  He was good.  Bigger than life.  But, again, I want to say, I don't believe he was acting.  He was just, like, being this regular dude who, you know, might do a towel snap in the locker room once in a while kind of a guy.  I mean, I did not think him unintelligent one bit.  Did you give him a baseball glove or something?  I did.  I gave him a glove, yeah.  For what was the purpose?  I wanted to play catch with him.  I had, I was like, you know, so what?  He loves baseball?  What the hell? 
[02:57:30]  I know he loves baseball.  I know he loves baseball.  And I know I love baseball.  You're the president.  I don't have any money or nothing to give you.  But you and me like baseball.  Here's a glove.  So I had someone go down to the mall.  That's awesome.  I actually went.  I went down to the mall to the best sporting goods store in D.C.  And I was like, I want the best Rawlings baseball mitt you have.  I mean, the very finest.  And I know a good mitt when I see one.  And it gives me this beautiful, you know, feel of his love. 
[02:58:00]  And so I go to the, back with the White House.  And of course, the Secret Service cluster like, what the hell are you doing?  And I go, sir, it's a glove.  Please take a look at it.  So they looked at it and they went, all right.  You can give it to the president.  You can offer him a glove.  So I did.  I was like, yo, man, I don't have nothing to give you, but I know you like baseball.  So here's a glove, sir.  And Mr. President, of course.  It was pretty cool.  And he enjoyed it and saw the...  There's a picture, I think, in a couple of different books of him holding the glove up. 
[02:58:30]  Yes, he enjoyed it.  Did you meet Senior at all?  I met him briefly at the Wall of Astoria.  Just briefly.  For a couple of minutes, I got to speak with him.  That was pretty cool.  Vic Henley tells a story about him.  And he says that when you meet him, because, you know, he has such a bad reputation as being  a wimp and all this stuff.  But remember that reputation he had as Reagan's VP?  I do, yeah.  But he was head of the CIA.  And Vic said, you feel like you're meeting a fighter pilot. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Wimp, really?  Desert Storm, really?  Yeah.  No.  And World War II, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he was a fucking veteran and a pilot.  But that was the reputation he had as Reagan's VP.  Well, yeah, because, you know, he talked like that and he didn't, you know, we're not going  to do it and all that.  But there's, again, a guy that if you see him out of the presidential spotlight, you're  going to see a different guy.  Uh-huh.  This relaxed, serious dude.  But when they prop you up and go, hold your head here, hold your hands here, say these words, 
[02:59:30]  wait, the camera's not on, the lights, you know?  Yeah, if you're not an actor.  Yeah.  And in both of those, that was the thing I always liked about the father and the kid  was like, pretty, you know, it's not, you're going to find out what they're thinking.  There's a picture of you and Bush.  That's a great shot.  See?  That's a great picture.  Yeah.  And obviously with Clinton, you have them in love at the same time.  Would you like a picture like that, Jimmy?  Dude, he's met three presidents.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Yeah.  Do you have pictures of all of them?  I don't, my, I do. 
[03:00:00]  I don't have any with Bush Sr.  No?  No.  What's Obama like?  Crisp, pleasant, spent five minutes talking to my daughter.  But very businesslike.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huh.  Was he looser?  Bush seems like a funnier guy to me.  Like, he seems more of a regular, that's why he fucked up more.  He seems like more of a funny dude.  When I performed for him in the troops, he came up to me afterwards and he like gave me  like a bear hug, which was kind of cool.  Bush. 
[03:00:30]  And he pats me on the belly and he goes, looks like you lost some tonnage.  It made me laugh.  I'm like, you know what?  It's pretty funny, actually.  Not bad.  Pretty funny.  Lost some tonnage.  Oh, there's you and Clinton.  Fucking Clinton.  During the lithium days, look at that lithium bloat.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Was it?  Yeah.  Let me, look at that.  I thought that was an SNL prosthetic.  That's lithium.  Wow.  Damn.  Lithium bloats you?  I didn't know that.  That's what they told me, yeah. 
[03:01:00]  Does it kill you hard-ons?  Huh?  Does it kill you hard-ons?  Some of those medications fuck your dick up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does.  Wow.  A lot of them do.  Yeah.  I mean, when you're, like, seriously twisted as I was, and no one really knew what was wrong  with me, right?  Mm-hmm.  So they're like, and plus you're, like, in the emergency room, like, at some famous hospital,  it's like, he's on TV and could jump off a building, and we don't really want it known  that he was here, and let's treat him for all, and I was on lots of drugs that I didn't need 
[03:01:30]  to be on.  Were you, when you weren't performing, either on SNL or on stage, were you constantly just  fucked up?  Were you constantly, like, all, was it all-encompassing?  Yeah, for a while.  Really?  For a number of years, yeah.  Is that exhausting?  Yeah, sure.  Jesus.  It wears you down.  I never did it on the air over there, because I'm not that stupid.  Right, right.  I'm not smart, but I'm not that stupid.  Oh, you managed to keep it off the air?  Oh, no, I never was high on the air.  Wow.  Never. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, God, Lord.  I mean, would you fly the space shuttle?  Right.  Wasted?  You wouldn't.  I mean, you're like, I gotta tough this one out.  I mean, I got a few hours to go.  Mm-hmm.  I'm gonna be right back to the crack house.  Wow.  I only actually did the crack one time.  Did you ever do it?  I did, yeah.  I was in Washington Square Park, and I met this dude, and he's like, I, he's like,  you wanna try the pipe?  And I'm like, yeah, okay, why not?  So we made this arrangement. 
[03:02:30]  I was actually looking for weed, you know, and I was drinking beers, and we made this arrangement.  He would buy the crack, we would smoke it, I would pay for it, he would protect me from  anyone that wanted to hurt me.  Hey, there you go.  Cut to 131st at 7, 4 o'clock in the morning, crack house, like a real crack house.  Wow.  With real crack addicts.  And we're there, and I don't know how to smoke this stuff, and I'm doing it.  And I don't know, have you ever done it?  No.  It scares the shit out of me.  Take like your best orgasm, multiply it by five, prolong it 12 hours, and you can see 
[03:03:00]  the appeal.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  I don't understand.  And that's not, it's even better than that.  So I'm there, and I'm in this house, and, you know, only white guy there, the owner of the  house.  But the only reason I say that is because, see how I dress?  I don't dress kind of like a white undercover cop.  I dress exactly like that.  You know what I mean?  He's all black, I'm wearing black sweatpants, a black jacket, and a Yankees hat, of course. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, glasses, I mean, that's undercover.  Yeah.  So the guy walks up to this guy who was protecting me and buying all the drugs, and he goes, yo,  Seymour, man, I don't want to be disrespectful to you or nothing like that, but you're wrong  about this dude here.  That dude is police.  And Seymour's like, you ain't police.  I was in a motherfucker on TV last night.  Oh, shit.  From across the room, this woman, topless woman, between puffs off a crack pipe goes, 
[03:04:00]  That's Clinton.  I mean, really?  Even in a crack house?  I mean, really?  You're that popular?  I mean, is there anywhere I can't go where people don't love you?  Can't get away, man.  Who was the guest host that week?  Do you remember?  I don't think, I don't remember, and I don't even know if I was on the air that week.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Aren't you two of the record for being on the longest?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, by far.  Which is what, it was 10 years?  14. 
[03:04:30]  14 years.  Wow.  You miss it?  I do, but I also know it wasn't time to go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But sure.  When you go back for a case.  I just did Dom Pardo this weekend.  That was you?  Yeah, you knew it was somebody else.  Fuck.  No, I read that somebody said, that was a fake Pardo.  Yeah.  And it's like, it was really close.  It sounded exactly like it.  No, I read it somewhere.  Oh, yeah, okay.  And then, but they, I didn't, they didn't say who it was.  Oh, shit. 
[03:05:00]  I didn't notice it.  Play the opening montage.  I saw Kevin's monologue.  I did not notice it.  Oh, lookit, you're under pressure now, Sam.  Can we be able to get it?  If you play the cold open where he goes live from New York on Saturday night, it'll lead  into the opening montage.  Yeah.  I think that's a guy, I can't, the guy's voice is so strong.  It's, you can, I came kind of close.  It really is.  So, yeah, I think you probably have to fast forward to the, is that the cold open? 
[03:05:30]  The following program.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was a bad first.  But I was very proud of that because that guy is hard.  Why'd they ask you to go?  For whatever reason, he couldn't make the show.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but, but from what, a lot of people were like, nah, that was him.  That was, like, you fucking nailed it.  It was pretty close.  Damn.  I listened to it this morning.  I thought it was pretty close.  To introduce Kevin.  Is there anyone, yeah, Kevin.  I guess, I guess, I helped, it helped hearing him for that many years.  Yeah, we're just waiting for that.  14 years, you got to hear it. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, I mean, I was around him all the time.  Yeah.  Did you ever do it, uh, to him, uh, at, no?  No?  I mean, I, one time, um, he had laryngitis once.  Yeah, that'll be it.  If you could just, what, fast forward to the end of the cold open.  One of the Philadelphia.  Yeah.  He does a pretty good Obama, that guy.  Back up, back up, back up.  Back up.  Sam, please, you're fired.  Back up, back up, back up.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Well, y'all have to make sacrifices. 
[03:06:30]  It will be a difficult road ahead.  But trust me, nine months from now, you won't remember this sequester ever happen.  Why?  Because there'll be another way worse financial crisis to deal with.  So, Godspeed, America.  And live from New York, it's Saturday night!  It's Saturday night live!  With Brad Armisen! 
[03:07:00]  Oh, shit!  Vanessa Bayer!  Bill Hader!  It's not bad, right?  Aaron Killam!  We got the trill in his voice.  Jeff Myers!  I couldn't believe I was doing that.  That was flipping me out.  I thought I was going to mess up when he said musical guest. 
[03:07:30]  That's what I was afraid of.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We got a lot of people.  That's a long list, man.  Featuring.  Here comes the music, guys.  That's what I knew I was going to screw up.  That's good. 
[03:08:00]  Alright, here we go.  Now I'm getting nervous.  Musical guest, McLemore and Ryan Lewis.  Kevin Hart.  Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Hart.  You poured it on there.  That was good.  I didn't notice that when I first saw it.  I mean, now that I know, I'm like, oh, okay. 
[03:08:30]  But it's fucking damn close, man.  I did not notice that watching it.  It's nearly close.  Yeah.  I was proud of that one.  Is that all he does there?  Is this the announcement?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Has he been doing it since the very beginning?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's been there.  How old is he now?  Oh, crap.  Don't know.  He's got to be well into his 80s at this point.  The voice of SNL.  I mean, what a fucking cool gig. 
[03:09:00]  Right from the beginning.  He said, Chevy Chase.  That's crazy.  Richard Breyer.  Yeah.  I mean, it's so weird.  Like, watching him do, like, vocal warm-ups at SNL.  Oh, yeah?  Like, one day, he had gotten off the elevator, and there was a sign beside the elevator.  And he would walk around and read labels from things while he was warming up.  He's like, sexual harassment seminar.  And he really talks like that, right? 
[03:09:30]  Really?  That's his voice.  This coffee really blows.  It's no...  You know?  Quite a set of pipes.  Yeah, huh?  Very recognizable voice.  That's why it's really hard.  It has to do a fucking warm-up, too.  That's interesting.  What color would say when you saw the impression?  Orange.  Yeah.  What's the color say about it again?  Just sees it in colors.  I don't understand it, but I've thought of it many times since.  It's such an interesting way that the brain works.  Yeah, yeah.  Who knows? 
[03:10:00]  It's just a little game I play with myself to kind of lock in.  That's all.  Anyone you're working on trying to perfect that you...  No.  Yeah?  No.  I like doing El Sharpton.  Yeah, that was El Sharpton.  I told you the New Orleans cop story last time.  I like doing that guy.  That's about it.  Yeah.  What's the best impression of anybody that you've ever seen anyone else do?  Like, is there one that you look at and just awe and go,  Oh, fuck.  Let me think about that for a second.  I think...  Come on. 
[03:10:30]  Give me a minute.  Because there's a couple.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, there's some great ones.  I've sent that and I go,  That's the best impression I've ever seen.  Yeah.  How about you?  Name someone.  I mean, it's hard.  There's so many great ones.  I mean, your Sharpton is fucking...  That's dead on.  For the obvious reasons that it sounds like Sharpton,  it has all his inflections.  The fact that you're a white guy doing Sharpton  and most black guys can't...  That's just an amazing impression.  Yeah, thank you.  I love Jay Moore's Colin.  I think it's an odd one.  Yeah, that is an odd one. 
[03:11:00]  Jay Moore does Colin Quinn.  And it's so honorable.  Also, I believe his Christopher Walken.  Of course.  Walken's amazing.  But his Colin, I think, is better.  Yeah, it does get Colin.  Because with Colin...  I never heard him do Colin.  Well, yeah, it's not one he would try and pull out  because everybody would be going,  who is that?  It's amazing, his Colin.  It's like talking...  We had Colin in here once talking to him.  He's a terrific impression.  Oh, he's fucking...  Yeah, he's a psychopath.  Who saw that?  You know?  Is he really?  I didn't know that.  Well, yeah, I say that with affection.  Jay's nuts.  Yeah, Jay is.  I didn't tell you that.  He's fucking crazy.  Jay's batshit crazy.  Yeah, he's batshit crazy. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's why we all get along.  He's a talented motherfucker.  I'm a little bit, too.  Yeah, of course.  I like the obscure impressions.  You know, just out-of-the-way ones?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God, I want to...  I know there have been a couple  where I look at it and go,  wow.  Were there any Rich Little did  that you liked?  Or did you not like him?  Was he like a hack when you were a kid?  Or are you respectful?  No, I loved him,  and I still love him.  Yeah.  I mean, he did more great impressions  than I guess anyone I've ever seen.  He was the go-to guy  back in, you know, 
[03:12:00]  the 70s.  I mean, I feel like I probably had  like five or ten great impressions  in my life.  I think he probably had 100.  He did a great Carson.  He didn't do Clouseau well,  and I never forgave him for that.  But he did an amazing Johnny.  Oh, yeah, you have a Rich Little story, right?  Which one?  Who was it that you met  that brought you up on stage or whatever?  Maybe I mixed you up with someone.  Oh, that was someone else.  Oh, it was someone else.  Okay, someone else.  No, it was Daryl.  When?  When you were first starting out?  Who was the performer? 
[03:12:30]  You stood on line to meet.  Oh, my God.  Who was that, Pal Talk?  Tell me.  I don't know.  He was on the show.  You brought him up.  Oh, I don't remember.  Oh, no, that might have been Kevin.  No.  Kevin Pollack.  Oh, it was Kevin Pollack.  You're right.  Sorry.  Kevin Pollack does it.  Sorry, Matt.  Speaking of great impressions,  how about the Shatner?  Shatner.  Kevin Pollack's Shatner is really good.  He does a great walking,  but the Shatner is great.  He has all the inflections.  Not really touchable, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's probably awful just as an impressionist being asked about other ones, 
[03:13:00]  but I'm always interested in what would impress you as being a fucking...  What would be the number one out there?  Yeah, or which ones do you look at and go,  everybody likes that?  It's easy.  The guy that played Bush on MADtv.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is he the one that died recently?  No, Frank, you know...  Oh, Frank Caliendo's great.  Caliendo.  Fabulous.  He's a great impressionist.  Fabulous.  I think that's the...  That's...  His Bush is, I would say, as good as impressions can be.  Yeah, he really does a great fucking George W.  He does a lot of great ones. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Lots of great ones, yeah.  The guy who died who did him and looked like him recently.  Yeah, he was very good.  Oh, you think Caliendo's was better?  Absolutely.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That's the best Bush I've seen.  The other guy just looked more like him.  And as good an impression as I've ever seen.  I think Jay Farrow's Stephen A. Smith is wonderful.  Who's Stephen A. Smith?  A commentator on ESPN.  Oh, I wouldn't recognize him.  Yeah.  We got Jay doing Colin Quinn for 20 seconds.  Oh, yeah, 20 seconds, yeah.  For Daryl.  This is quick. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, Colin's on the phone and then Jay's in studio.  I think the American people, you know what, are determined to prove they're not racist.  Stop giggling.  Be a professional for crying out loud.  You know what I'm saying?  Stop talking like that.  You know what I'm saying.  Yes.  Do I have a head injury that nobody told me about?  Why wouldn't we know what you're saying?  You just had a simple salient point.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.  He gets the words that Colin would use, the way he'd use that.  The way he'd slide into it. 
[03:14:30]  I'm going to put a little salient point.  It's a mumble slide that Colin does when he talks.  Absolutely.  Unreal.  Colin's hilarious.  Unreal.  Jay gets smarter when he does that impression.  He's a dumb bell and he does that impression and he's fucking a genius.  He gets into a weird mindset.  That's what I admire about a great impressionist.  Is when they get into the mindset of the person and you can see them thinking like, it's really fucking incredible.  Do you ever imagine that your face looks like the person's face when you do the impression?  Because I've noticed over the years trying to do certain people, it helps to almost imagine you're making the same mouth or nose, some kind of physical thing. 
[03:15:00]  Even though you know you're not looking like the person.  But just to have that image, it kind of helps.  Yeah, sure.  I mean, when I was doing them, I always tried to pick up on a couple of mannerisms.  Physical, facial, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you ever do one that you didn't believe?  Like when you're doing one.  I've done plenty of shitty ones.  And you feel like, I'm Daryl, I'm Daryl, I'm not the person. 
[03:15:30]  Like you were just kidding.  Yeah, plenty of fucking shitty emotions.  Could you give us one example that you hated?  Oh, fuck, that must be 20.  We asked that knowing you're brilliant by the star.  I thought that McCain was bad.  Although I will say this, I did do McCain really well once.  And if you can look up McCain Old.  McCain Old.  Please look that up.  Sure.  I'll hold on SNL with Will Forte as Brian Smith.  All right.  But when my dad died and they had like a soldier's funeral, I could not be. 
[03:16:00]  I mean, I was out of my mind.  I couldn't do a soldier.  No shit, yeah.  I couldn't, you know, his body and voice were affected by what happened to him in war.  My dad bonded about being a soldier at the end of the end.  I didn't want to play him anymore.  Right.  I didn't want to play him, you know.  But if you can find McCain Old, I didn't.  But then when I went back to do him in the fall, I just couldn't pull the trigger again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That might be it.  Is it?  No. 
[03:16:30]  No.  McCain Old.  Oh, it's such a shame we don't have somebody better than Sam.  Yeah, I know.  It really is.  On the computer.  The lady in the horse gag porn would do a better job Googling this.  Sam is notoriously bad.  In fairness, I did do him well one time.  Yeah.  Will Forte play it by whims.  It had Amy Poehler in it, Fred Armisen.  The trouble, like the hardest part I believe would be something that's topical, because  obviously it's SNL, you've got to be topical.  A news story happens and then they tell you, hey, do this guy. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  And that's got to be frightening.  Yeah, like when I tried to play Mitch McConnell, it was like, what?  It didn't work.  I was like, I had like no time.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I've since regretted that, because I felt like I've got to do a pretty decent one.  Obviously, Donald Trump was fucking amazing, too.  That was so much fun to watch.  Yeah, but that wasn't very accurate.  That was an exaggeration.  Sometimes that's better than an accurate depiction, because it was so fucking fun. 
[03:17:30]  And when I did Sean Connery, that was an exaggeration.  Right, yeah, yeah.  You're getting so close, dude.  Sam's almost got it.  That's it.  Here it is.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Now, just tell me if this is not a pretty good mechanic.  What?  That's where the video was at one point.  Oh, come on, Sam.  You're breaking everything.  Stop breaking it, Sam.  You suck.  Oh, man.  Sam.  You're fired.  It was pretty good.  In fact, I had lots of compliments on it.  But then when I came back in the fall, I was like, I don't want to do this. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, that's kind of...  So what I did was, rather than imitate the sounds that came from his physical abuse in  war, you know, I just came up with another version of him that was good enough to be  funny, but it really wasn't very satisfying.  Wow.  And especially to people who had seen me do it the first time.  It's got to be so weird to change doing an impression.  Yeah.  You know what works.  I mean, there's no question about it.  It's weird.  Oh, come on, man.  Oh, Sam.  They may have pulled the video.  You are fucking this whole thing up, Sam. 
[03:18:30]  NBC may have pulled it.  You're brilliant that you can even find that.  Oh, Sam.  We called him brilliant.  He is so not brilliant.  No, he's really not.  I actually have it on my phone.  Blithering idiot.  Yeah, we could play through your phone.  You could?  Yeah.  Oh, man, yeah.  No, just put the phone up to the mic.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  We don't care.  So we do it all the time.  We've done it.  Works perfectly.  Heh heh.  Sam.  By the way, Daryl Hammond, as he finds the video, will be at Caroline's Friday and Saturday.  Tomorrow and Saturday at Caroline's.  Uh, 212-757-4100 for Daryl Hammond tickets. 
[03:19:00]  Coming up, coming up.  Sam's doing, like, a perfect impression of a shitty producer.  Yeah.  It's, like, spot on.  He's actually crazy.  If there was a guy named Cunt Who Can't Google, this would be the greatest impression of him ever.  Yes, it's wonderful.  Come on.  You guys, McCain-O, McCain-O, please.  Oh, man.  I want to see this now, too.  Oh, man.  God damn it.  Yeah, come on.  No?  You don't do commercials, though. 
[03:19:30]  No, we're finishing.  Nah.  Yeah, we're just about done, but we're at 10 o'clock.  We're done.  All right, I guess I screwed it up.  Come on.  I'll try it.  Oh, you know something?  It didn't happen.  It didn't happen.  You could just do it.  You could just, like, find it.  Take your time.  And Kinston Pete says, Jay Farrow, now on SNL, does a great Denzel.  Oh, really?  Denzel Washington, yes.  I can't find it.  Sorry.  Oh, man.  Dean Edwards did a great Denzel, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought Dean Edwards were underused.  Like, he was a funny guy, man.  His impressions were really just Chris Rock was great.  Oh, he's wonderful. 
[03:20:00]  And a great Michael Jackson, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But not a hacky Michael Jackson.  Oh, and Sidney Poitier was beautiful.  Did he do Poitier?  Yeah, he did.  A beautiful Poitier.  I don't know if it ever made it on the air, but he did.  Yeah.  Very talented young man.  Yeah.  Are we rapping?  Oh, man.  Yeah, I guess we are.  Sam, well, you ruined the end of the show, Sam.  No, you're brilliant.  You're brilliant.  You need to get close to finding that thing.  Obviously, it's been pulled.  Oh, man.  Well, Daryl is at Caroline's tomorrow and Saturday.  Great, great comic, of course. 
[03:20:30]  I'm going to need to tell you that.  212-757-4100.  If you want to see the great Daryl Hammond.  Yes.  Get the paperback book.  It's a fascinating book.  I love the book.  What about the hardcover?  Whatever you want.  I ran in like two days.  It's a fascinating book.  It was a quick read.  Quick read.  So much.  Thank you.  Page Turner, as they like to say.  It's a short book.  No, Page Turner, as they say in the biz.  Thank you.  I really liked it.  And I'll be in North Carolina tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday in Charlotte.  Safe trip, Jimmy.  At the Comedy Zone.  Unless my plane crashes and I'm killed.  We were supposed to have Don King today, but it didn't happen, I guess. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, man.  He said he was sleeping late.  He was sleeping late.  He didn't see it.  Don King?  Oh, look.  That is a good impression.  He finally put it on the TV.  Wow.  You look just like him.  Oh, thank you very much.  What a coincidence.  I know.  He just pops up on the TV.  MSNBC.  Daryl Hammond, thank you.  Thank you.  We're done for today.  Yes.  Tomorrow, we have Jim Jeffries coming in.  And who else?  I'm so jealous.  I'm going to be gone.  Oh, I did?  Terrence Howard's here tomorrow.  Yeah, Terrence Howard.  Terrence Howard, that's right. 
[03:21:30]  And then David Lee Roth on Monday.  Oh, my God.  That should be fun.  Yes.  DLR.  Thanks, gentlemen.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Pleasure a second time around.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I think Roland's got a crush on the comedian that we're going to have in here in a little  bit.  No.  He's hilarious.  And what did you say about his body?  He's very fit.  More fit than Troy.  What?  Troy is slacking.  So right now, Troy's in the height in his little booth because he's going to feel un-inferior. 
[03:22:00]  Un-inferior.  That's a good thing.  Because in radio, I mean, if you're thin, you're like the hot guy here.  That's me.  Yeah, you too.  Hotty boom body.  There's a lot of slobos.  Right.  Are you talking about Eric?  Everybody here.  Everybody.  There's a shitload of slobos here.  Mm-hmm.  And then Troy's like the fit guy.  And then we have like a guest.  Fit guy, you said.  Yeah, like a fit.  Okay.  Then we have a guy fitter than Troy.  It's like the spotlight's on him. 
[03:22:30]  It's going to be interesting.  No.  I wanted to say, first of all, did you hear...  I just told you.  How come Eric's coming in?  Because he's not fit.  Because he's not fit?  Yeah.  Because of what we're talking about, right?  Yeah.  Ow!  Eric, did you pull Daryl Hammond saying I was brilliant?  No, it slipped my mind.  That seems like a no-brainer to me.  Actually, I pulled the segment where he was doing all the impressions and talking about  other people doing great impressions.  I didn't think to pull the sample.  Did you hear him say...  I'll go back and get it.  Did you hear him say I was brilliant? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Everybody was all, oh, Sam, you can't find the video.  Sam, you can't find the video.  Let me tell you something, okay?  All Daryl Hammond said was, if you can find McCain old on SNL, I go, come on, you can't  give me more than that?  And Daryl Hammond, to his credit, goes, you know what?  You're brilliant for making it this far.  That's what he said about me.  And he's a brilliant impressionist.  Eric, what I'm saying is, brilliance knows brilliance.  Well, can I point out that we've done the bit about you can't do Google searches that 
[03:23:30]  well as a producer, because while I pulled the Colin Quinn clip to show an example of  Jay Moore doing that, I was also looking for his Eddie Vedder, and the part I landed  in that video was them yelling at you, because you couldn't pull up the right Eddie Vedder  clip on the computer.  But what happened yesterday when Travis was on the computer?  Or two days ago?  I don't think they said anything.  Well, you actually don't listen to the show, so you probably wouldn't have heard them scolding  Travis for the exact same thing.  He was just in there sleeping or looking at... 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, you get up about seven.  Wrestling photos or something.  But the point of the matter is this.  I swear to God, the minute that Daryl Hammond walks out of the room, I found the clip.  Oh, good for you.  Because what happened was, you got to go, here's the process, okay, because the video  itself has been taken offline everywhere.  So I had to go.  I had to find what date that the skit took place based on write-ups of, here's what happened  last night on SNL.  Okay, so now I have the date, right? 
[03:24:30]  Hulu has old episodes of SNL, but only on Hulu Plus.  So I have to log in to a Hulu Plus trial, okay?  Then, they don't list SNL by dates.  They list it by episode number.  So I have to go back and find what episode number translates to this date that I'm looking  for, okay?  Then, then, Eric Nagel, I have to go find that episode, scan through the episode, and get  to the clip that was being looked for, okay? 
[03:25:00]  All the while, I have these birds chirping in my ear going, oh, Sam, oh, Sam, come on,  Sam.  Sam, you are brilliant.  That was the one bird that I appreciated.  So what am I going to do now?  Prove it to the world and share.  Why don't you just hit play from where I've queued it up, Roland.  Do not move that cursor.  Just hit play.  Take up the Republican nomination.  This is what we were looking for, Eric, and I found it.  Not you.  The general NBC News investigation, it has not the light of the presumptive Republican 
[03:25:30]  nominee, John McCain, is in fact old.  Told you I found it.  NBC News has obtained a copy of McCain's birth certificate.  This was the clip that Daryl Hammond said was the one time he did John McCain well.  This is what he was comfortable with.  The kind of old that makes you not really trust him.  This part's obviously not John McCain.  It's the newscaster.  To the potentially damaging nature of these allegations, we've invited Senator McCain to  be on the program.  Senator, what is your response to this scandal? 
[03:26:00]  I wouldn't really call this a scandal.  The fact is, I've never lied about my age, nor should I ever have to.  Eric just left the room.  I'm 71, but I work 24-7.  I'm very active.  So you wouldn't describe yourself as old?  Absolutely not.  Senator, this investigation was exhaustive.  Let me show you some of what NBC uncovered.  Here's a surveillance photo of you, Senator, walking into Bob Evans to take advantage of 
[03:26:30]  their buffet.  Yes, I was having dinner.  I don't see how that's relevant.  Can you see the time stamp on that photo, Senator?  It says 4.30 in the afternoon.  My friends, I would rather talk about national priorities like the young men and women serving  in Iraq.  They also went into your bank records and found this.  This is a check signed by you, Senator. 
[03:27:00]  It was sent to your grandson for his birthday.  As you can see, the check is for $5.  And the memo line reads, for penny candy.  Can you explain this, Senator?  I don't see anything wrong with giving my grandson a birthday present.  But look, I want to discuss pork barrel spending.  They also uncovered...  All right.  So that's the one time.  And it's brilliant, by the way.  That's the one time Daryl Hammond felt good about his John McCain.  I don't know if I've ever seen Daryl Hammond do an impression that I thought was bad.  I guess when it's him, he's a little harsher on himself than... 
[03:27:30]  He does great Trump.  Most of us, we...  Oh, he's brilliant Trump.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  There's a reason why he's the guy who's been on SNL longer than everybody else.  But yeah, for the record, I made it.  Now call us up, 866-WOW-1-WOW, if you learned something.  866-969-1969.  Did you learn anything today, Sal?  Because I worry about you.  Just your brain withering away.  Yeah, I learned, I learned, uh...  Yeah.  You're not convincing me right now, Sal.  Yeah, I'm trying to think of something from the first hour. 
[03:28:00]  First hour was, uh...  You could go second if you want, or anything.  Anything.  No.  No, you didn't learn anything today.  I didn't learn anything.  Nothing.  You see what I'm dealing with here, Roland?  I know.  He just disappoints every time, doesn't he?  I'm sad.  He got mad at me in the meeting on Tuesday.  Oh, he did?  He did, right?  He got a little bitey.  Because I forget what the thing was...  What brought up what I said that you got so mad at?  You just said, I don't have a creative bone in my body.  Right, but there was something, obviously, the attention was brought to you for a reason. 
[03:28:30]  Um...  You don't remember that either.  Now, something, it was, I suggested that Travis had an idea about something, and, uh...  You're not good with memory retention, are you?  No, Travis had an idea about something, and I said, I don't know, I said it was too contextual,  and then you jumped in about that.  Well, and, yeah, and then I let, I reminded everybody on staff that you don't have a creative bone in your body.  You didn't like that, that I brought that up at the meeting.  No, because then you said, you're talking.  I said, you were the one who was fucking talking first.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  Yeah, exactly, Sam.  Eric.  I forgot that, too.  Is the problem with Sal, is it his long-term memory? 
[03:29:00]  It seems like short-term he can handle a conversation, but memory retention does not seem to be his strong suit.  No.  All right.  You're asking Eric.  I guess so, in conversation, so, so where, uh, Sal lacks in memory retention, maybe you have a little conversational problem?  Yes.  Yes, okay, good.  Yeah, well, keep it, keep it brief and factual.  That's important.  Can I ask Sal a question?  You guys may ask Sal a question.  When I got back to my desk late afternoon, there was cookie crumbs on your share.  Yeah, there was, there was, when I got, like, when I came in today, there was fucking cookie crumbs everywhere. 
[03:29:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, Sal, when did you get a share in your office?  I got a share right after when Eric threw out my previous one.  I don't even know what, I'm not going to get into the whole bullshit.  You and Eric get into some bullshit that goes on behind the scenes where you're, where you, you, you make fun of each other and you trash each other's stuff.  But then the minute that I talk to either of you about it on the air, you go, oh, I'm fine with Eric.  So I don't care what goes on between you and Eric in that office.  Because we don't hold actual grudges at the end of the day.  We're just dicking around.  Yeah, but you won't even talk about it later. 
[03:30:00]  Because it's uneventful.  And you guys are pissed off at each other back then, but you're pussies, so you don't bring it up in front of everybody.  No, it's just not that you, you try to, you try to.  You try to blow things out of proportion.  Blow things out of proportion.  You just said Eric threw out your chair.  Yeah, we know, we've said this many a times.  All right, well, I'm, that's what I'm saying.  And then you're saying I'm blowing things out of proportion when he's throwing out your office furniture.  That's why I'm not dealing with any of the bullshit that goes on between you and Eric.  Because you don't translate it into a conversation.  Yeah.  Because you're pussies and each one of you is afraid that the other one's going to get mad. 
[03:30:30]  I'm not afraid of Eric getting mad at me.  And I don't think Eric's afraid of me getting mad at him.  It just doesn't go anywhere, that's all.  And you know why it doesn't go anywhere?  Because we're pussies, Eric.  Because both of you are pussies, they don't open your mouths.  Roland, am I off kilter at all here?  One minute he says, Eric threw out my chair and he brought it up out of the blue.  And the next minute he says, well, Sam, you're always trying to blow things out of proportions.  When you're the one who just brought it up.  Yeah, I was just giving an example.  You see what I'm saying, don't you, Roland?  Anyway.  Thank you. 
[03:31:00]  Eric, even you see what I'm saying.  It's very tiring.  It's worthless to bring it up.  It's tired you're involved with it, Eric.  I don't even want to listen to myself on this.  But you know why Eric's not involved with it?  Because Eric won't sit here and belabor the point.  I'll be like, Eric, are you going to bring it up or are you a pussy?  He'll go like this, I'm a pussy.  And I'll go, okay, move on to the next topic.  I'll talk about it.  You've got to keep the show moving.  Exactly.  Thank you.  You know what Sal does?  Sal, Eric is the guy who's like, hey, I see a bike path.  Anybody need any, like, grease in the wheels? 
[03:31:30]  Anybody need anything to keep you guys moving?  You want me to tighten your seats up?  I've got an air pump here.  You know, the bikes go faster when the tires are well inflated.  And Sal goes, I've got a stick.  I can stick in your spokes.  No, it doesn't help anyone.  We're trying to keep the bike race moving.  Anyway, the cookies.  He doesn't address it, does he, Eric?  There's nothing, what do you want to talk about?  Ask me any question and we'll talk about that.  In one ear or at the other.  What do you want to talk about?  No, no, no.  What were you saying?  Yeah, Roland said that when he came back from work yesterday or wherever you were,  that there were cookies all over my, there were cookie crumbs everywhere today. 
[03:32:00]  I don't, I don't.  Well, you were also, Roland was also throwing cookies into the wall.  You see what I'm saying, don't you, Troy?  It's insane.  And I don't want, I don't care about the cookie crumbs.  Because you know what's going to happen with the cookie crumbs?  It's going to be another premise that you bring to the show that just goes nowhere  because you and Eric won't fight with each other unless it's off the air.  Troy, you see it, don't you?  Oh, my God.  It's just, they will not go after each other.  Oh, cool kid.  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.  Sal's over here starting shit again that's going to go nowhere because he won't talk shit. 
[03:32:30]  How did I start shit?  You asked me.  Troy.  Yes.  Who started the shit here?  He's the one who brought up throwing out chairs for some reason.  What happened?  Sal brings up cookie crumbs.  I don't want any.  No, I brought it up.  What are you talking about?  But you're the one who keeps wanting to expand on it.  No, no, no.  I got to talk about these cookie crumbs.  That's why Sal's a little angry.  These guys like bicker with each other and then they won't, they won't seal the deal.  They won't go the final distance and they won't talk shit with each other on air.  You see it?  Yes, absolutely.  Who kid?  Audience, I have to tell you guys. 
[03:33:00]  Sal and Eric spend hours fighting with each other off the air.  Rowan, is it hours or is it minutes?  Rob Cross goes, I'm done with it.  Rob Cross doesn't want to deal with them.  They spend hours fighting and fucking with each other's shit and then the minute that  you just go on the air and say, hey, what happened yesterday?  They go, I'm cool with them.  I'm cool with them.  And then they go, Sam, you're trying to make a big deal out of nothing.  And I'm going, what the fuck are you talking about?  You're throwing out each other's office furniture. 
[03:33:30]  But these guys also will not seal the deal on taking shit to the final level.  Because they're pussies and they're afraid of getting the other one getting mad at the  other one.  Nah, they're not vaginal.  They're vaginal.  Who can't?  That's even worse.  Vaginal.  One person will do something bad to the other and then the other's like threatening to take  it to the next level and then they'll never do it.  But remember Eric said, or Sal goes, fuck Eric.  Of course he said fuck Eric because Eric wasn't in the room.  And then they'll talk about it too.  Like remember, Sal was going to rip down all the pictures on the wall. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, they come in to me with all these ideas.  Sal goes, yeah, I'm going to start ripping photos off the wall.  Because Eric in his office has a wall full of photos and he loves his photos.  Who kid, you've seen them?  I've seen them.  They make everybody does it too.  Right.  8 by 10s all over the wall of weird, crazy shit that's happened on the show.  Gay shit.  Like what's the craziest thing that you've seen on the wall?  I think you're getting spanked or something like that.  Exactly.  Bob Kelly picking me up by the underpants to spank.  That was sexy.  You like that a little bit.  I'm a feminine guy. 
[03:34:30]  It's okay.  Yeah, it's in.  It's in.  It's hip.  So, yeah.  And Sal comes over and he starts saying, yeah, I'm going to rip down Eric's photos.  I'm going to rip down Eric's photos.  We're like, do it.  We're like, take all of them and put them in the fucking paper center.  And you know what he does?  He goes up and he goes to the wall and he's like, hey, Eric.  And he starts just moving one corner of the photo and he's like, Eric, I'm going to rip your photo, Eric.  And Eric goes, Sal, don't fuck with my shit. 
[03:35:00]  And then Sal goes, what do you guys want me to do?  He told me not to fuck with his shit.  I can't do it.  We go, then don't present any of your air quote ideas to us.  He'll never take it to the level it needs to go to.  Come on, man.  Never.  You got to be a nigger sometime, man.  I don't know what that means, but it sounds like good advice.  They have no idea what that even means.  Get reckless, Sal.  Sal, would you ever consider being an N-word?  I don't know how to do that, so I wouldn't even consider it.  I don't know.  Rip the fucking photo, goddammit.  Steal that shit, right?  Who can? 
[03:35:30]  I mean, my God.  Take shit to the fucking final level.  Or keep me out of it.  Or just don't do shit.  Be like, yo, I'm a fucking pussy.  I'm not going to do anything.  That's real.  And then the minute there's hurt feelings, the minute Eric gets...  Nobody wants to hurt anybody's feelings.  Yeah, then what are you doing shit for?  What the fuck are we doing on this goddamn show?  What's going on?  It's not the show.  It's all behind the scenes shit.  That's the point.  Yeah, but then the shit comes on the air.  I'm going to tell you something.  I don't do shit like that for it to come to air.  Yeah, you know what? 
[03:36:00]  Because I'm wanting to piss on Eric.  Exactly.  Why would you do entertaining shit on the air when you could do gay shit instead, right?  No, because I'd rather just do shit to annoy Eric than abuses me.  He's doing all this shit, right?  Behind the scenes.  Yeah.  He won't bring any of it to air.  They're like, you got to do something on the air.  He goes, okay, I'll get my balls and asshole wax, friend.  What?  What?  Like, you know how funny it would be if it was like, he took off every goddamn picture  on that wall and put it in the paper shredder and left the clippings right on Eric's desk?  That would be some serious shit.  It would be funny, Eric would be like, holy shit, Sal, where the fuck did you get those 
[03:36:30]  balls from?  And Eric would be all pissed.  He'd be like, why would you do this?  And Sal would be like, fuck you.  And Sal was in the fucking booth.  He's like, fuck you.  You know what?  Maybe Sal is just young and he needs these lessons to be taught to him.  Do you think Eric would actually punch you?  Yes, Eric has.  Oh, he has punched you.  Again, no.  I don't want to hear what Eric's done to you.  Because you just bring it up and it'll go nowhere.  Don't tell me one thing that Eric's done to you.  So then where do you want to go in this conversation?  I don't want, I want to go, I'm going to, me and Troy and Roland and Who Kid are going  to talk about you with you in the room.  As if you're not here.  Or he'd go down, march down the office while he's stuck there behind the board. 
[03:37:00]  I don't want, no.  No.  Because he's just going to.  It's just the stuff that amuses me.  And the audience, if you would share it with them.  Off the air, that I, that things I like to do.  But he doesn't even commit to anything good.  Let me tell you.  No, never.  You guys are very angry right now.  I'm going to tell you, because he came in here with some bullshit again, Who Kid.  I can't handle it.  I got some great advice once.  When I was young, and I was starting out, the great Steve Carlesi, fine producer, executive  producer, this program, God rest that man's soul, he put up with more bullshit than any 
[03:37:30]  man should ever have to put up with.  Eric, you'll agree with me on that, won't you?  You saw it all.  I saw it.  I saw a lot of it, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He gave me great advice.  I was young, and I was just going crazy off the air.  Just doing stuff, like Sal said, to amuse myself.  Just going and fucking with people, and throwing Eric's shit in the garbage can, and being  like, oh, fuck you, fatty.  And Eric would be like, fuck you.  And there's no work getting done. 
[03:38:00]  And Steve sees it.  And he's the guy in charge of the program.  He's like, you guys got to stop fucking around.  And he sat me down, and he's like, Sam, I get that we're in a creative environment.  Because he knew.  You know what I mean?  He wasn't one of these guys that's just like, you know what?  I want you sitting in front of your computer, except when you're in that studio.  Then be creative.  But off the air, you got to be creative.  Sit in front of your computer and do it quietly.  That's not what he said.  He said, you do all this shit off the air, and it doesn't translate on the air.  You can't do it here. 
[03:38:30]  You're at work.  Like, you know, if you're working in the IT department, you're not dropping cookie crumbs  in some place that I've never heard of.  Or do I want to know about, Sal?  Don't bring up those cookie crumbs.  No, because nothing happened.  Don't bring up the cookie crumbs.  Cookie crumbs.  He said, whatever bullshit you do off the air, if it doesn't translate on the air, don't do it.  Makes sense.  He said, take any creativity that you're expanding off the air, bring that to the air, because 
[03:39:00]  that's where we need the creativity, not in this bullshit office nonsense.  So what did I do?  I started doing characters of all the nonsense voices I was doing.  I started bringing all the, everybody's business started coming on the air.  All of it came to the air.  And it was for the better.  It was for the better of the show.  It was, I became one of the most hated men in radio, but I was okay with that.  But I didn't come in here and be like, oh, some shit went down yesterday. 
[03:39:30]  Sam, what happened?  No, nothing.  I mean, we're fine now.  You want to see exactly what happened yesterday?  No, no.  No, okay.  I don't want to hear about it.  And the key word that you mentioned is creative.  Creative.  And you had said that Sal is not a creative person.  Yes, I did.  Put me wrong.  In other words, you were never half-assed.  That's right.  Who can?  That's another ebonic term for your white ass.  That's right, who can?  You can't be half-assed, Sal.  Just go with it, man.  I need you to prove me wrong, Sal.  Sal is very non-committal.  Very.  Well, he's frightened. 
[03:40:00]  He doesn't know which.  He's non-committal in the sense that he doesn't know.  He's not scared of Eric, are you?  He doesn't know.  He's either going to fucking, he's either going to grab his nuts and be like, all right,  I'm fucking taking this shit to levels.  Like, Eric fucked with me.  Grabbed his nuts.  Eric, he was starting to videotape stuff to put it up on his YouTube.  Sure.  And he took my banana.  You mean an E-Rock video?  Yes.  So he took my banana, and he smeared it into the carpet by my desk.  You remember doing that, Eric?  Yes.  Okay. 
[03:40:30]  So I said, okay.  It's funny, because then Troy gets back, and there's banana shit all over his computer and shit.  So I said, okay, motherfucker.  I went to his desk, and I put my arm down on the desk, and one swoop, I took everything off the desk,  into the floor, and I said, don't fuck with me again.  His computer, everything.  Yeah, everything.  His speakers, all, you know, he has, he has discs piled up that he, he archives.  Right.  So he has some sort of, you know, system going on there.  Sure.  Everything was on the fucking floor.  Right.  I said, don't fuck with me again, and guess who hasn't fucked with me since? 
[03:41:00]  Eric.  Yes.  And you haven't fucked back.  And you haven't fucked back with them.  I don't, I don't, I don't fuck with people like that.  Ain't nothing but a gangster party around here.  Yeah, Troy, I ain't gonna fuck with him.  Right.  Now.  So you want Sal to do that?  No.  You want Sal to go fuck him up?  No, I want Sal to either step up to the plate, and if he's gonna fuck with him, fuck with  him.  When I got that advice, I was put at a crossroads.  And it was either, you calm down off the air.  Yeah.  And, you know, you do your work, you don't disrupt people, and then you come on the air and you 
[03:41:30]  do whatever you're gonna do.  Or, any disruptions you cause, better at some point lead to something on the air.  I'm just asking you to prove me wrong, Sal.  Okay.  Don't let me walk around saying Sal doesn't have a creative bone in his body.  Look, I do things to amuse myself off the air.  Roland can attest to that.  You can masturbate yourself all day, but do it at home.  No, but if I don't.  We're in the business of amusing people.  Yeah, but things I do to Eric or Eric's shit. 
[03:42:00]  We are in the business of amusing people.  Why you would amuse yourself and only yourself at work where you are here to amuse people  is beyond me.  So he's never won any battle against Eric?  Everything.  There's never, like, any real battle.  You see what I'm saying?  What's the record here?  No, there's no record.  Because there's never any real battle who can...  Because they start, like, this big, like, oh yeah, I'm going to get him.  I'm going to get him. 
[03:42:30]  And then everything just goes to pussy.  Wow.  It just goes from zero to pussy in 60 seconds.  They just kiss at the end, huh?  Yeah.  A bunch of little girls around this motherfucker.  Exactly.  Bitches.  I mean...  I don't believe Sal is like that, though.  Sal is like a nice guy, good guy.  That's what he is.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Right?  He's just a nice dude.  But what's another name for pussy?  Meow.  Nice guy, right?  If you're like, oh, he's a nice guy.  Like, who can...  If I said that to you, who can...  Oh, he's a nice guy. 
[03:43:00]  Dude is nice.  He's like, get the fuck out of my face, man.  Exactly.  What are you going to do?  It's like being a hairy pussy.  I don't know, man.  Exactly.  That would be tough sometimes, Sal.  Right.  I don't think Sal...  Get some hair on that pussy, Sal.  Get some hair on that pussy.  I know.  Get some hair on that pussy.  Are you going to prove me wrong?  No.  I don't know.  I don't really care.  He isn't, is he?  No.  That's the problem.  He doesn't give a shit.  You heard him say it.  I don't care...  Eric, did you hear him say that?  Eric, did you hear him say that?  Like I said, I like to use myself.  You're too busy bronzing yourself, because that's better. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, it could be.  It could be slightly more amusing than...  Oh, yeah, yesterday.  I didn't even do anything yesterday.  Sal, you don't see me letting some foreign woman wax my balls on the air.  You know what would have happened if ONA had been like,  Sam, you have to get your balls waxed.  I would have been like, that's not true.  No, I don't.  But, I mean...  No, I mean...  I do other stuff.  I mean, we've discussed this.  I mean, Sal has to bring something to the plate.  But instead of doing the stuff that's like just for himself,  this is just my side project that I do for me. 
[03:44:00]  This is Sal's side solo work.  He instead makes it...  But I'll do the group stuff.  I'll do some gay shit.  But for me, I'll just do funny stuff.  What do you think he was excited to show the gentleman his genitalia?  His genitalia.  Let's bring in Chris.  He's not going to do anything, is he?  Sal?  Yeah.  Oh.  Chris.  What's up, man?  You just missed an uproar.  I would have gotten you in here earlier, but shit hit the fan.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  What happened?  Is it DiStefano or DiStefano?  DiStefano.  DiStefano, yeah.  Okay.  You're at Caroline's tonight, right?  Tonight, yep.  7.30.  It's a big deal because...  Is this your first time headlining at Caroline's?  No.  I've headlined there like three times, but I usually do like this thing called the Breakout  Artist Series where it's like a new comic doing like a Tuesday night at like 9.30,  but this time, Thursday, 7.30, they consider it more prime time, so that's why...  Because it's the start of the weekend.  Yeah, right.  The start of the weekend, and then Daryl Hammond's there. 
[03:45:00]  Do you know DJ Who Kid?  What's up, brother?  What up, sir?  What up, kid?  This is DJ Who Kid.  What up, my nigga?  Oh, holla.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He'll let you say the N-word if he likes you.  Wait.  I can say with the A.  You already can?  I'm from Bushwick, so I feel like...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but you get the pass, though.  Somebody's got to give you a pass.  Oh, okay.  You're right.  Being in here, I'll get the pass for you, but I'm saying, back in Bushwick, I've gotten  a few passes from my boys to say with the A, never with the E-R.  Oh, of course.  With the A.  It's okay.  You know what I mean?  I was like the only white man in the neighborhood.  From Bushwick, man.  He's good.  Yeah, so it's...  Is Bushwick not hipsterized yet? 
[03:45:30]  No, well, now it is, but in the 80s...  I was born in 84, and it was the hood.  Like when Bushwick Bill was like, oh, shit.  Bushwick Bill, my father.  He is, yeah.  So, yeah.  He hit it, Mom Dukes.  She likes little black guys.  So you were raised among black people?  I was raised amongst the black people.  That's got to be scary.  And I was...  Yeah, I went to a Catholic...  Yeah, it was nuts.  I went to Catholic school, too, so I would get my ass beat.  Oh, you went to a Catholic school?  I went to Catholic school, and you know, it was come up. 
[03:46:00]  You went to Catholic school?  Where are you from?  Who kid you went to Catholic school?  Yeah, in Brooklyn, in Rasmus Street.  I went to Holy Cross.  Oh, nice.  Holy Cross.  I didn't know, like, rappers and DJs could be like, yeah, I thought you had to be like  a...  I went to college.  What college did you go to?  I went to CW Post, and then I went to Queensborough.  Oh, I went to NYT, right next to CW Post.  Okay.  Yeah, we were stupid.  We were fucking the same bitches, man.  You guys were like, yeah, yeah.  I grew up in Bushwick, but then I went to a private school and went on to college.  I know, I got my doctorate degree, but I'm from Bushwick. 
[03:46:30]  Nah, DJ for drug dealers.  Yeah, I did.  So you went to college and became 50's Ed's DJ.  Yeah.  And you went to college and became a comedian.  Yeah.  What do your parents react when they're like, when you're like, no, I'm going to pursue  comedy?  Well, you know, at first, my mom was pissed.  My dad just supports anything that can possibly get me around women, so he doesn't...  My dad's just a dirtbag.  So you're not gay, though, right?  So you're just fucking girls at?  But my mom, because I went and became a physical therapist. 
[03:47:00]  I went to a lot of school.  I had to get a clinical doctorate degree.  Speaking of you being a physical therapist and gayness, Roland was just in here.  You met Roland.  Yeah, I know Roland, yeah.  He was in here talking about what great shape you were in.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm the most deceiving...  I'm not...  I used to be in good shape, but now I just have bitch tits.  You do.  Because I have an in-shape face.  Yeah.  But my body is not great.  It's not...  It used to be good.  I played basketball overseas right after college.  Professionally?  Yeah, I played in Europe for like maybe three and a half weeks. 
[03:47:30]  Kind of short, though.  You're a short guy.  But you know what it was?  I had the jumper, and being from Bushwick, playing with those guys.  And in high school, I played behind this guy, Sonny Arda Gaines, who was on the Utah Jazz.  So my high school was a really good high school.  Yeah.  He's from Queens.  He's from around...  Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, before we get all carried away in high schools, you know who went to my high school?  Oh, shit.  Ray Rice.  Holler.  Yeah.  And did you see, over the weekend, that shot from like half court, the high school?  Yes.  New Rochelle High School. 
[03:48:00]  New Rochelle?  New Rochelle High School.  That New Rock City Arcade is pretty good out there.  Yes.  I've been in there plenty of times.  Okay.  Okay.  You know who went to my high school, too?  I had a high school, Sonny Arda Gaines.  This is my homeroom.  I swear to God.  I had Mike Baxter, who's a left fielder for the New York Mets.  Wow.  That guy, Gilberto Val, the cannibal cop.  You guys know that cannibal cop?  That guy was sat in front of me.  The one that was just in a paper.  The one who wants to eat women went to my fucking high school.  He did?  He was my partner in Christian marriage.  What the fuck out of here?  You know we have to babysit an egg for a week. 
[03:48:30]  You guys have to do that?  You have to do that?  No, I saw it on Saved by the Bell, though.  No, we have to do that.  We have to do that.  And I swear, I'm not making this up.  He always wanted to crack the egg.  He always was like, we should just crack the fucking egg, man.  And I'm like, dude, if we crack it, if we crack it, we're going to fail the class.  We should just crack it and eat it.  And now I'm like, oh, so that's what you want to eat, you sick bastard?  Bro, you want to scramble people's kneecaps?  We could go to the supermarket and just get eggs.  He was a fucking nut.  But I mean, you know, he was weird.  He was a weird dude.  So you went to school with Cannibal Cop? 
[03:49:00]  I went to school with Cannibal Cop.  I was with him quite often.  Did you hear about this story?  I heard about it, but that's crazy.  You were behind a murderer.  Dude, I was behind Cannibal Cop.  In front of me was Mike Baxter, left fielder.  On the other side, Sonata Gaines, Utah Jazz.  Then there was this other kid, Will Rosinski, who was like fucking like a Team USA boxer.  He fought Kelly Pavlik.  This is all your class, not even just your school.  This is my class.  This is what we're doing.  So weird.  That's incredible.  People say you can't get out of the hood.  Sounds like you're doing great.  Well, yeah. 
[03:49:30]  Exactly.  Bushwick.  This is like the mean streets.  We're doing all right.  But did Cannibal Cop ever say any other weird shit?  Because now, like, they were saying that his wife went on his computer and he was talking  about wanting to kidnap her and let her bleed out slowly.  And look, I think, from what I'm reading in the paper, that apparently this is a fetish  that a lot of guys have.  A lot of guys?  I don't know.  Like, people all over the world, you know, do this.  I'll say this about Cannibal Cop.  He was one of the guys who went through school pretty much unnoticed. 
[03:50:00]  He would sit, you know, other than wanting to smash the egg and eat it, you know, which  was technically our baby.  He wanted to eat the egg.  He was acting a fucking egg baby.  The only other things that we notice now, reflecting back, is he used to eat all the  erasers off the pencils.  He did?  That's it.  But, I mean, that's what a lot of kids did.  But until how old?  I mean, through high school.  We were seniors.  Yeah, that's some weird...  A senior in high school, eating his pencil.  It's like, what?  Yeah.  All right, well, if you're saying a lot of guys have this fetish, I'd say one, two, 
[03:50:30]  three...  There's five guys.  Let's see if it's one.  I don't want women to bleed out.  Do you?  Is that your fetish?  Or...  I don't.  You don't?  Who, kid?  I know you're into some weird shit.  I mean, if it's my wife, yeah, but not my mistress.  No way.  That's not a sexual thing, though.  That's just...  I just wanted to die.  Yeah, you just wanted to stop talking.  I agree with Cannibal Cop.  Troy, do you want bitches to bleed out?  I've eaten abroad when she's been bleeding out.  But that's...  That's period juice, I'm assuming.  Not...  Spicy.  You didn't make the blood through incisions. 
[03:51:00]  Eric?  But Jesus.  You're into that shit a little bit, right?  No, not at all, Sam.  Okay.  See, that's the thing.  I think you're right.  You know why?  I ran out of here.  You heard Eric just now, right?  That was a lie.  I've never heard a lie.  There's nothing believable about that.  Eric is obviously into bleeding women out a little bit.  But that's crazy.  Yeah, man.  I mean, I was like...  I get competitive over people who go to my high school wanting to be, like, you know,  the most famous dude from the high school, but Richard Roundtree went to my high school.  Right.  Shaft.  Yeah.  So...  That's a pretty big guy. 
[03:51:30]  But, like, for you to have all those people just in your class, it's, like, ridiculous.  Yeah.  And then, I mean, my high school was, like, Ray Romano went to my high school.  Jesus.  Kenny Anderson, Kenny Smith.  It was a pretty, like, known all-boy Catholic high school.  Is it a well-to-do...  So are your parents rich?  No, not at all.  No.  Because I was going to say, like, how do they...  Why didn't they take some of that money and just move to a place with good public schools?  Well, I mean, my mother never wanted to leave the...  My dad's from the Bronx.  My dad's, like, a no-education street thug from the Bronx.  Like, and my mother's, like, a very, you know, educated, postural, astute woman. 
[03:52:00]  So my parents are totally different.  Your dad's saying, well, if it was good enough for me, it'll be good enough for him.  He was a great...  Marry a Rocky or something.  Yeah.  All you really need to know is how to throw dice anyway.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But, uh, so I don't know why I never moved.  She wanted me to go to a Catholic school.  Old boy Catholic high school.  Damn.  Old boy.  Which now is, like, a risky...  It's nuts.  That's why fucking Gilberto snapped.  Because it's like...  The cannibal cop.  Yeah, the cannibal cop.  Because it's like, we never saw a woman before, you know, in high school. 
[03:52:30]  And that's not how life works.  Like, we have to be around women.  And then, when we all got into college, like, you're just popping boners.  Look, everyone's looking for every girl.  I couldn't do it, man.  Weirdo.  You said you did it, though.  No, I went to St. John's Prep, co-ed high school.  Oh, in Queens, baby.  Yeah, so I was, you know, I was wondering what they were doing.  They probably was wagging off and all kinds of shit in there.  But now, you're on an MTV2 show, Guy Code, right?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  And Guy Code is just, like, breaking down guy-girl relationships.  I guess, yeah.  Where'd you get this experience to draw from if you were just hanging out with dudes? 
[03:53:00]  Well, here's what I...  Here's what the thing.  I was, like, one of the dirtbags who...  There was an all-boy Catholic high school.  That's the one I went to, Malloy.  And then four train stops away with Mary Lewis Academy.  Is Malloy bad?  Don't drop the soap.  Don't drop the soap, baby.  That was the rumor about it.  Yeah, you heard about it.  I almost went there.  I told my mother, fuck you.  You did.  You know what I'm saying?  She made me go there.  My mom.  That's weird.  But there was an all-girl Catholic high school, the Mary Lewis Academy.  Oh, yeah.  And I used to go there every fucking day, scouting out. 
[03:53:30]  I knew the rats in the subway terminal outside.  I was there all the time just trying to get numbers.  Just trying to get phone numbers.  So I got something like that.  Yeah, and your dad was into that.  My dad loved that shit.  So your dad didn't object to you going to an all-men's school?  I mean, he would be like, oh, he's fucking homo.  You know, the basic dad shit.  Open house.  Look at this guy's fucking, look at this kid's ass.  You know, like, he would call me gay all the time.  But I think, like, I was gay.  His father called you gay all the time?  That's just like a thing that Italian dads do.  You know, like, they're just always like, well, my son's a homo. 
[03:54:00]  Look at his haircut.  You know, like, all the time I have to deal with that.  Like, apparently my wife gave birth to a little fagal.  What is he doing over here?  Well, yeah.  Who kid came in here earlier this week?  Like, he was worried.  His dad never called him gay.  But, like, the other morning, he was leaving the house and his dad was staying with him  for whatever reason.  And he said to who kid, you look cute today.  Yeah.  And who kid was like, what?  That was weird.  But not like high school who kid.  Like 41-year-old who kid that stands before you. 
[03:54:30]  That's weird.  Yeah.  I thought that maybe there's a word for being molested at 40.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm 40.  You're 40?  You guys look so good, man.  It's that oil kid.  You always look great.  That nigga juice.  Is that what it is?  N-word juice?  All right.  I would love to.  You don't know Diddy?  All this fucking...  He's so famous.  I thought Diddy was proactive, though.  Yeah, but he has the equal liquid that you put on your face.  N-word equilibrium juice?  I understand.  Whatever.  I understand.  I need some of that.  Yeah.  Is there anyone you could bottle it?  We all look young. 
[03:55:00]  You look young.  Yeah, I'm 28.  So I feel like...  You don't look gay, though.  The thing is, I think I got, because of the hairstyle sometimes, it's like, my dad was  the type of guy, for example, if I had a stiff neck or something, I'd be like, oh, it's  because you suck Latin guy's cocks.  It's like, what?  Latin guy's.  He would always get specific.  How's Roberto's dick taste?  I'm like, who's Roberto with your stiff neck?  Yeah.  This kid takes it in the ass.  He likes yogurt.  You know?  It's like, what?  So what would have happened if you had come to your dad?  You know?  I mean, it's the 2000s now. 
[03:55:30]  We're an open society.  If you had been like, Dad, no, for real.  I'm gay.  Yeah, I know.  No, no.  Dad.  I'm a gay dude.  If I really can't, honestly, I think my dad, it would be hard for him to swallow.  No problem.  But he would.  No homo.  Yeah, no homo.  Sorry.  But he would accept me.  As long as it was a white guy.  If it was a black guy, he would not accept me.  That would be too hard for him to handle.  He wouldn't let no fucking black dick inside you, man.  He can't.  I don't think I can get black dick.  Fuck.  I could bring home that white dick, that Asian dick, but I couldn't bring home that black 
[03:56:00]  dick.  So racist, man.  I like that, though.  I'm not, but he's from old school.  He's from the old school.  The other side of the Bronx.  Like, we're at Bronx Tale, Bedford Avenue, over there.  Oh, yeah.  The Italians have passed the homophobia thing.  They're over that.  Yes.  But racism is still prevalent.  Racism, I don't think will ever go away amongst them and my family, you know?  Right.  They're great people, but they just let that shit fly, you know?  Thanksgiving, Christmas.  Can you believe it, Sam, in this day and age, a black dick can't go in a white butt?  I mean, I guess to each butt its own, this is a statement I'll go on record with.  You sounded disappointed when he said that. 
[03:56:30]  No, I wasn't disappointed.  Okay.  I'm just looking at the, you know, the whole...  Social implications.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Let me go to Bobby in Connecticut.  You're on the after show.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Chris, I'm glad to hear you got some other time, you funny motherfucker.  Thanks, buddy.  Can we kind of get it off of the gay shit and talk about his hot chick?  Like, Carly's fucking gorgeous, dude.  Jesus Christ.  You got a bad bitch.  Yeah.  The girl's hot.  But she's been on the show before.  She has been on the show before.  Troy, you know who his girlfriend is? 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, we've actually all hung out.  Really?  Yeah.  That's funny.  Can I see a photo of his girl?  Oh, yeah.  Do we have...  Does she still have red hair?  She has red hair, tattoos.  She's the comic who Troy brought in here.  We were busting Troy's balls bad that day.  He was like, yeah, I met her on Instagram.  We were like, okay, you met her on Instagram.  Were you dating her at the time?  I was not.  No, I was not.  I didn't even know her at the time.  I met her over the summer.  She's still in...  I forget what her Twitter is.  Oh, sorry, Playboy.  Is it at Carly Aquilino?  Oh, yeah.  Plug your Twitter, then. 
[03:57:30]  What is it?  Well, what's your...  First of all, what's your Twitter?  You're going to promote yourself.  It's at Chris D Comedy.  Chris D Comedy.  That's way easier than this.  Yeah, she's got...  Is it Carly Aquilino or Carly Fry?  I know.  Why can't she just make a goddamn easy Twitter name?  It's Carly Aquilino.  I can't remember.  C-A-R-L-Watt.  You want me to write it?  I want that guy to do that.  Yeah, right.  Because, I mean, this chick obviously has no vision for the future.  I mean, she wants to be a...  Is she still doing comedy?  Yeah, she's on an MTV show that's coming out in April.  I think it's going to be a huge show.  Oh, really?  She's like the star of it.  Of course.  Her...  Yeah.  Well, tell her to change her goddamn Twitter name, then.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[03:58:00]  She's hot.  Very cute girl.  She's sexy, yeah.  She's a good girl, too.  She is cool.  And she's really funny, and they fucking busted my balls so hard about her.  Well, come on.  I mean, you've seen her.  Yeah.  And if you're finding out that Troy's like, yeah, I met her on Instagram.  I just think she'd be funny for the show.  It's like, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, dude, it's all right.  It's all good, don't you?  I mean, honestly, if he had brought you in and been like, hey, I met him on Instagram,  I thought it'd be funny for the show, it'd be like, okay, Troy, we know what you're  up to.  You went to Catholic school.  Yeah, exactly.  It doesn't work either which way.  I try to bring something to the goddamn show.  Yeah.  It's just either... 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, Troy's just trying to get his dick into something.  Your girlfriend's beautiful, too, Troy.  Yeah, his girlfriend's beautiful.  Yeah, Troy has a beautiful girlfriend now, and it's all good.  But so is it weird dating a comic?  You know what?  With Carly, she doesn't do too much stand-up anymore.  She's really good, and she's going to get back into it.  And actually...  So how'd she get the show?  Because I'm on...  She opened for me.  I headlined Caroline's at Breakout Artist thing I told you about a few months ago,  and she did a spot in front of me, and the guys who created Guy Code were in the  crowd watching, just supporting me, and they saw her, and they were like, oh, we have 
[03:59:00]  this other show.  Is that the same show Jesse Mae Peluso's going to do?  Same show.  Very cool.  The same exact show.  Very cool.  Yeah, so they were friends.  One of them posted Instagram or the other.  Yeah, they're friends now.  And we actually live...  Jesse Mae...  Because I live with Carly now in Park Slope, and Jesse Mae and Giannis, they live right  around the block from us.  There's a whole little comedy network happening.  Park Slope, baby.  I love it.  White Brooklyn.  Park Slope is a place to be for all up-and-comers.  I think you said she wasn't funny, either.  That's what I do recall.  Well, I mean, yeah, but I was busting your balls.  She's new, though.  She was new.  I mean, she is new at stand-up, but she's funny. 
[03:59:30]  She's a great writer.  She's new.  Yeah.  She was nervous.  Yeah.  And the problem with a hot chick is you've got to be funnier than you are hot.  Right.  And the day she walked in here, she was hotter than she was funny.  Absolutely.  Wow.  So, but you saw the picture.  She's a hot girl.  She's bad.  I'm telling you, I've seen some rough cuts of the show.  I think it's going to be coming out in April.  She's all over, and she's got good, hard, nice bits.  Yeah.  Good shit.  That's good.  Stand up, she's going to start again.  In your fucking face.  Do you see?  In your fucking face. 
[04:00:00]  Who brought that shit to the show first, motherfucker?  Get the fuck out of here.  She's got some nice red hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's good.  Is that real?  Is that a new human?  But are you going to get jealous if she becomes, like, you know, star?  Am I going to get jealous?  Or if they're like, oh, fuck Geico.  That's all about this new show.  You know what it is?  I think some people have asked me that.  I don't know.  I'll tell you this.  She's getting, you know, a lot of stuff.  MTV is really, like, in love with her.  And I'm honestly genuinely happy for her right now.  I am. 
[04:00:30]  Because I feel like I got my own thing going on.  You're like, bitch, you're not even on stage and you're getting gigs.  What the fuck?  And I feel like, you know, if I get the opportunity to, like, go out and headline and do that stuff,  like, she would come with me.  You know?  And it'd be cool.  Yeah.  And she's like, I know, I was a fucking premium dirtbag, like, all types of different girls.  Like, just a fucking piece of shit.  Oh, I see.  Because I was so deprived for four years in high school.  And I was just a...  And then when I met her, like, everything stopped.  So I'm just, like, totally in love with her.  It's just her.  And I'm not afraid to say it.  When the comedy goes to a whole new level.  That's what I'm wondering.  Right now, it's still a healthy relationship. 
[04:01:00]  Let's be guys here.  Let's talk honestly.  Yeah.  You know that when that shit goes to the whole new level, like, you're getting, like, B-list celebrities.  Like, you have the ability to fuck that.  Exactly.  It's kind of hard to turn that down.  Oh, yeah.  What if you get famous?  And then all of a sudden, like, whoever's coming up to you.  Rihanna's like...  Rihanna's...  Yeah.  I mean, Rihanna, we know she's a whore.  You seen her Instagram?  Oh, my God.  I just posted to her.  I saw that.  Holy shit.  Fuck.  Honestly, and I know...  And you can hit her.  She doesn't care.  She does not care.  She's into that shit.  Yeah.  I mean, honestly, I know, like, if my dad was listening, he'd be like, this kid is gay. 
[04:01:30]  But I...  I know.  What I'm going to say is I don't fucking...  And this is how I know, like, I'm in love with her and I don't care because I really  don't care if my boys make fun of me and my dad makes fun of me.  Like, I am, like, so in love with her and so into her that I don't think I would cheat  because I was a dirtbag cheater.  Right.  So this question with another girlfriend...  I've had other hot girlfriends, but there's something about her that I'm just like, I  want to...  I won't fuck around with.  She's got that good pussy.  I love her.  You know what?  It could be a good pussy.  It could be...  That could be the thing.  Fuck anybody who's calling me a faggot while you...  The thing is, though, when you're with a girl like that, you've got to make sure that 
[04:02:00]  you stay smooth.  Yeah.  You've got to make sure you stay clean.  And you've got to be ready to shave at a moment's notice, right?  Yeah.  But the problem is, like, you're sitting in front of the mirror and you're like, I forgot  to buy blades.  You've been there, right?  What?  Shave my pubes, you're saying?  No, your face.  Oh, my face?  We're talking about dicks.  Oh.  Oh.  No.  No homo.  Now, now you're stuck digging through the trash, because you're looking for that old  blade that zombied out your face yesterday. 
[04:02:30]  Uh-oh.  Right?  Or, you're one step away from stealing your chick's lady razor, where she shaves her pubes.  You don't want that.  You don't want that on your face.  Uh-oh.  I mean, the pubes you could have on your face, but the razor, you don't need to share.  This, Chris, is your Dollar Shave Club moment.  Dollar Shave Club is for guys who routinely forget to buy or simply hate shelling out for blades.  So, here's what all the Dollar Shave Club buzz is about.  Everyone buys razor blades, right?  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Love them.  Well. 
[04:03:00]  I got them in my pocket right now.  Brand name razor companies, they nail you.  They build them with, like, ten blades, and they have vibrating handles, and all this other  bullshit.  You end up paying up the wazoo for them.  Dollar Shave Club says stop overpaying for shave technology you don't need.  With Dollar Shave Club, you send them a couple bucks a month, and they deliver great quality  razor blades right to your door.  You save a fortune, and you always have fresh blades on hand.  Join all the Opie, the after, Opie and Anthony's show live listeners, I gotta add that in because 
[04:03:30]  they don't put it in the copy, who have already found the smarter way to shave at DollarShaveClub.com,  DollarShaveClub.com, DollarShaveClub.com.  Woo!
