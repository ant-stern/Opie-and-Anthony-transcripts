<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of a documentary, "Oral Sex is the New Goodnight Kiss," detailing the explicit sexual activities of affluent teenage girls.  Anthony's reaction was dramatic, involving physical comedy.  A clip from the documentary was played, further highlighting the graphic content.

The conversation then shifted to Anthony's contentious divorce and his experiences with his opponent's lawyer, Dominic Barbara.  Anthony described Barbara's aggressive tactics and exorbitant fees, contrasting his seemingly affable public image with his ruthless courtroom demeanor.  Callers shared their own opinions on Barbara and the ethics of divorce law. One caller noted that Barbara framed news clippings of his high-profile cases, including Anthony's, in his office.

Next, a bizarre interaction with regular caller Bobo ensued, in which the hosts encouraged him to interview an undocumented immigrant, leading to potentially offensive and inappropriate exchanges.  The segment concluded with the hosts playing Genesis' racially insensitive song, "Illegal Aliens," followed by further discussion of Arizona's immigration law.

The next segment opened with a discussion about a high school friend, Glenn Notice, and his disgusting spit trick performed on David Letterman.  This led to a discussion about spit in general, a YouTube video featuring a woman performing a similar trick, and whether the hosts would allow a woman to spit in their mouths.  The conversation then turned to a racially insensitive "Black to the Future" parade float and the use of blackface.  Jimmy Norton's appearances on Red Eye and Hannity, the sale of Norton's Borgata tickets, and Bret Michaels' health scare were also mentioned.

A lengthy, graphic discussion about the poor quality of toilet paper in the SiriusXM studio followed, including detailed descriptions of the hosts' bowel movements, bathroom habits, and the messy state of the studio bathrooms, particularly focusing on a mysterious individual's repeated toilet destruction. Listeners called in with their own stories of poor toilet paper and unusual bathroom experiences. The conversation transitioned back to lighter topics, including Anthony's car trouble, more listener calls, and a detailed discussion about proper defecation techniques.  Finally, the hosts detailed a physical altercation with co-worker E-Rock stemming from a $500 bet involving Dr. Ian Smith.  E-Rock joined the show, visibly upset, to recount his side of the story.

The following segment centered on the ongoing dispute between E-Rock and Sam over the $500.  The origin of the debt, involving a bet with Dr. Ian Smith three years prior and E-Rock's subsequent delay in payment, was explained.  E-Rock's physical altercation with Sam over the money, his angry Twitter post, and subsequent exchanges were discussed. A new bet was created: E-Rock had to lose 10 pounds in two weeks to win back the money.  Dr. Ian Smith called in, and a weigh-in revealed E-Rock had actually gained weight.  The segment included various ad reads and digressions, including discussions of six-pack rings, the oil spill, and a particularly pungent fart by Danny Ross. A final bet involving E-Rock eating a jar of mayonnaise was made.  The show concluded this segment with a discussion of the Times Square bomber, with the hosts admitting to having previously reported inaccurate information about the case.

The next segment focused heavily on the Times Square bomber, including the hosts' speculation about the FBI's actions, specifically the possibility of intentionally letting the bomber board a plane to observe who might be waiting for him.  Air traffic control audio ordering the plane back to the gate was played.  A significant portion of this segment involved E-Rock attempting to eat a 30-ounce jar of mayonnaise for $350.  This involved graphic descriptions of his progress and distress, including eventual vomiting.  A caller criticized the show's reporting on the bomber situation, and Jim Norton's appearance on Red Eye discussing the bomber was mentioned. A caller claiming to work in intelligence offered his perspective on the FBI's handling of the bomber. A humorous interlude involved a studio employee, Love Buzz, receiving the wrong coffee order.

The final segment detailed another mayonnaise-eating challenge, this time featuring a guest called "Iraq," who consumed a large portion of the jar before vomiting repeatedly.  The hosts provided running commentary and made numerous crude jokes.  A phone call with Pete Evick, a friend of Bret Michaels, followed, discussing Michaels' recovery from a brain hemorrhage and apodectomy and expressing concerns about his well-being, contrasting positive public statements with his personal observations. The call was frequently interrupted by poor phone connection. The segment concluded with promotional announcements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, now, the OK Happy Show on the virus.  They're typical teenage girls from good middle-class families, but to hear them speak will shock you.  Oral sex to me really isn't that big of a deal.  I ended up having sex with like more than one person that night, and then the morning I was trying to get us the morning after pill, and I was like 14 at the time.  These girls from affluent suburbs freely and frankly describe their secret lives in a new documentary with a terrifying title, Oral Sex is the New Goodnight Kiss. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  Whoa.  You're right, man?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Sorry.  Wait.  That went flying.  Wait.  We all have to tweet that.  Oral sex is the new what?  Is the what?  To the who's?  I can't think.  I have no blood left in my head.  It's rushed. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know where it went.  Yeah.  Exactly.  To your liver.  Try to heal the damage.  No.  Canadian filmmaker Charlene Azam spent four years gaining their trust.  Do you literally think oral sex has become as commonplace as kissing for teens?  If you talk to teens, they'll tell you it's no big deal.  In fact, recent statistics cite that more than half of American teenage girls between the ages of 15 and 19 have engaged in oral sex. 
[00:01:30]  But Mrs. Azam says that...  Oh, my God.  No.  I fell over that time.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  Someone help Anthony up.  I love statistics.  What?  Her film is a troubling window into a horrifying reality no parent can imagine.  Girls as young as 11 or 12 having sex, going to sex parties, and at the most extreme, crossing into prostitution, exchanging sexual favors for money, clothes, even homework, all under their parents' noses. 
[00:02:00]  Still arriving home in time for dinner.  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Oh, fuck.  Get a hold of yourself.  God damn it.  My mic came off the stand.  Hold on.  Fix your mic.  Oh.  What part of that one got you?  Every.  Sorry.  Seemed to have dropped something. 
[00:02:30]  It's amazing.  I've never seen you hold this many things on the air before.  What was dropping?  Every time the story starts, you pick up a bunch of items.  Oh, wow.  I don't even know if I can play the next one.  Oh.  No.  I can't do it to you.  Do it.  I can't.  Yeah, you do it.  No, I can't do it.  And I can't play this next clip for real.  You have to.  I don't want to be responsible.  You have to.  Oh, for a hurtful boner that you're going to have. 
[00:03:00]  You're going to have one of those aching boners.  I'll pull it out and just start jacking right now.  Hold on.  Don't play it.  Let him pick some heavy things up first.  Will you stop giving away your fucking tricks?  I got to carry stuff.  It's funny.  You never normally hold that stuff.  What am I holding?  It all looks loud.  You want to hear?  Yeah, let me hear.  Five minutes and I got a hundred bucks, right?  If I'm going to sleep with one of them anyway because they're good looking,  then why not get paid for it, right? 
[00:03:30]  Oh!  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, God.  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  It's like you know they're feds.  But maybe at first.  And they're just looking like, yeah, it's you.  But maybe at first you're still holding out hope going,  maybe they're just business guys.  He's just reading SkyMall Magazine.  Right.  This is great foot massager.  I could buy that. 
[00:04:00]  That would feel good on my foot.  Looking down, just minding his own business,  hoping these guys are looking for somebody else.  Yes, the oxygen will drop from ceiling if depressurize happiness.  Very safe aircraft.  Don't look at me.  Ted's big vacuum and mile-long pipe could pour him.  I don't have any mile-long pipe.  I went down to a two-foot pipe.  I said I want to sell you 27,000 units.  How much are they each?  $35 a piece. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, wow.  But you have to twist them to make them go together.  And they're the size of a straw.  Very inconvenient.  Certainly is.  How are we going to use that to get rid of this fucking car?  I have a rowboat and a cup.  I'll take care of it.  Yeah, that's good.  Why else it's all clean coming up?  Like Sebastian Bach is crazy, but he's a good crazy.  You know?  Like he was high energy.  I'm like, dude, you've got to relax.  I mean, he'd come in with like these tight shirts and these tight jeans and eyeliner and hair all over the place and be yelling and screaming at me.  I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, but you need that. 
[00:05:00]  What do you have with a bunch of nice people on that show?  It's just a bunch of nice fat has-beens dropping pounds.  Why don't you come on the show?  Fuck that.  I don't come over your house and you and fucking Strahan help me with crunches, but I'm not going to listen to you break me down.  Oh, your dad jerked you off when you were six.  That's why you like pounds.  Check the fuck up.  Here's what I want to do.  Because even on the set of the fucking movie me and Nora was on, For Revengeance, I was an ass. 
[00:05:30]  Really?  Just an asshole, but not how I thought.  I thought just being in the cut, away from people, one word answers, walk away, was just, it fucking sucks.  This is the way a mother feels when her son quits doing drugs.  We'll be in Anthony, live next. 
[00:06:00]  We'll be in Anthony, live next. 
[00:06:30]  We'll be in Anthony, live next. 
[00:07:00]  We'll be in Anthony, live next. 
[00:07:30]  We'll be in Anthony, live next. 
[00:08:00]  We'll be in Anthony, live next. 
[00:08:30]  We'll be in Anthony, live next.  We'll be in Anthony, live next. 
[00:09:00]  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  Come on, come on, put the whole thing in your mouth. 
[00:09:30]  Freedom of fucking speech, like we've said many times, the freedom to say some awful things.  You might not like it, but we have the right to say them.  Oh, my.  We have low self-esteem as a show.  They are not doing anything.  They're not highly skilled.  They have no talent.  We are just exploiting people.  See, kids, smoke your pot, play your video games, and watch TV. 
[00:10:00]  You'll be better off when you get our age.  There's no ratings here.  No one cares.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Nice.  Good morning, everybody.  Guten Morgen.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  On your radio dial.  How's everyone doing?  Just waiting for a baby to be born.  How late?  How late?  We're up to a week. 
[00:10:30]  Gary said his kid was 10 days late for his first baby.  Who's?  Gary.  I think his first baby was like 10 days a week late.  Well, supposedly, like the rest of the world, goes with a 42-week gestation period.  Gestation.  But here in America, we go, ah, 40's good enough.  So that's why most babies are late.  Oh, okay.  Especially the first one.  Because they say it's going to be early.  What?  Is that what it is?  They're late because, like the doctor says, it's going to be a little early. 
[00:11:00]  They pick their early time, and then it's late, which is normal.  I think what it is really is that we're all impatient in this country, and we just want  to, like, you know, push these babies out, and we want to get the new mothers out of  the hospital as soon as possible.  Get them out.  Get on with it.  And move on.  Start raising that kid.  Yep.  One of your old friends is on the line, Anthony.  Really?  Who?  Well, Dominic Barbara.  Oh, wow.  Dominic.  Mr. Kumia.  Mr. Kumia, I need bail money. 
[00:11:30]  Come bail me out, Mr. Kumia.  You need bail money, Dominic?  When's your wedding anniversary, Mr. Kumia?  I forgot.  Now, let's see.  Dominic Barbara was involved in your life for way too many years, Anthony.  Yes.  It was probably three, a little longer than three of the worst years of my life.  Three solid years?  Three solid years of this guy being involved in my life.  To divvy up everything you had in your marriage, which was, I think, a used car and a rental 
[00:12:00]  property.  Yeah, yeah.  But it took three years to figure all that out.  Yeah, a rented house.  Not to break down businesses you might have had together.  No, no.  Try to figure out what you're going to do with the kids and sell a house.  We didn't have the proverbial pot to piss in or the window to throw it out of, yet I had  to deal with three years.  Of Dominic Barbara. 
[00:12:30]  Of Dominic Barbara and his legal wrangling.  And now, apparently, Dominic going through what is being called a messy divorce.  Oh.  Messy divorce.  Oh, boy.  This is karma, man.  Karma's a bitch, man.  It certainly is.  It certainly is.  When the fucking chickens come home to roost.  Oh, I hate that one.  I know.  I do, too.  Because I don't really know what that means.  Ah, it's when you throw out a bunch of chickens. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And then they come back and when you fleece a bunch of chickens.  No, I understand they're coming back, but wouldn't that be a good thing?  Chicken is delicious.  I love chicken.  So why would that be a bad thing that they're coming back to roost?  Come back to roost.  I can now have some chicken.  Or are they coming back to make all that obnoxious fucking sounds?  You just, in a way, said what Malcolm X said.  Like, when you throw something out there, when it comes back to you, it means you're kind  of getting what you throw out there.  Chickens are coming home to roost.  They always come back.  Right.  And that's what Malcolm X said when JFK got shot. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  He was told, shut up.  Don't say anything by Elijah Muhammad.  He said, I'm never sad when the chickens come home to roost.  That makes me glad.  Like you were just saying, it's normal.  Am I just like Malcolm X?  Look at you.  Well, hopefully after a speech at the Audubon.  But yeah, that got him in big trouble saying chickens come home to roost.  Who did he get a talking to for that one?  He certainly did.  There's nothing wrong with chickens coming back.  That's what he said.  It's an old farm.  As long as you can handle fucking butchering them in the backyard of your fucking farm. 
[00:14:00]  If you put out violence, violence will come back upon you.  Well, this karma thing with this Dominic Barber, because he's really just a scumbag.  I don't know what Anthony could say, but I could certainly say it because I'd live through  it with Ant.  Well, he's...  I saw the shenanigans that he was pulling, and it's kind of nice to see that he's suffering  a little bit.  I see it this way, as he is a public figure.  He has been on entertainment programs.  He's had his own TV show.  He's a regular on Howard show. 
[00:14:30]  He's a regular on Howard.  And the persona he puts across is not as a very nice person.  And my dealings with him on a personal level, I personally did not find him a nice, pleasant  person.  And to see this happening to somebody that was involved in me going through years of  misery...  For nothing.  I got to keep saying, for nothing.  You guys had nothing.  You barely had a bank account.  You didn't have a house together. 
[00:15:00]  You had no kids together.  And you only had one car in the family.  It really was kind of a, hey, let's get as much as we can out of him, even though right  now, he really doesn't have much.  And I didn't have anything because of the $40,000 that was kind of taken.  Right.  When Dominic got involved with your divorce...  Yeah, from day one.  He was her lawyer, obviously.  Yes.  Anthony had zero in the bank. 
[00:15:30]  Nothing.  Zero.  Zilch.  Zero.  Because someone advised...  Well, I guess I...  Whatever.  But you had zero in the bank.  Nothing left.  Nothing left.  And, yeah, and then you go through things where, you know, of course, a lot of divorces  when the wife secures a lawyer, you are to pay his legal fees.  You are to pay support for her during this tumultuous time in her life where, you know, she has  to live the lifestyle in which she is accustomed to, and you get to live some other foreign 
[00:16:00]  lifestyle that you are not at all accustomed to, except for one thing, which is going to  work in earning the money.  Correct.  That's the lifestyle I was accustomed to, and that's what I did.  And to see this happen, you know, I don't like doing things where karma might turn around  on me, but this seems to be some type of cosmic justice coming back to Dominic Barber. 
[00:16:30]  He is going through a messy divorce with one of his numerous wives.  I don't know how many, but...  Third, fourth, I have no idea.  Who knows how many he's up to.  The wife seems to have had a restraining order against Mr. Barber, which he then allegedly  violated by sitting down at a table in a bagel shop that she was sitting in and striking  up a little conversation.  Long on the divorce lawyer, accused of violating an order of protection by approaching his 
[00:17:00]  ex-wife in a bagel shop.  Nassau County police said Dominic Barber was charged with criminal contempt.  His clients have included Joey Buttafuoco and Jessica Hahn.  They say he sat down with his ex-wife, Leslie, on Sunday while she was having coffee with  a friend.  Leslie Barber told Newsday that her ex-husband walked in with a police officer and demanded  that she be arrested for stalking him.  Dominic Barber told the paper that she had indeed been stalking him. 
[00:17:30]  He was scheduled to appear for a hearing in Glencoe Court on Wednesday.  Oh, he's in one of those fucking divorces.  I demand you arrest her.  Arrest this woman.  What are you doing to me?  Why are the cuffs on me?  Oh, God.  Is there more to this, Danny?  That is...  That's a great paragraph right there.  You go in, arrest that woman.  Hey, why me? 
[00:18:00]  He's in one of those situations.  Yep.  With the arrest her, arrest him, restraining orders, this, oh, God.  A few of us have been in those situations, huh?  In that situation.  See what you did?  See what you did to yourself?  Oh, my God.  You son of a bitch.  Look at you.  So this cocky guy goes in with a police officer like, I'm going to watch what I do.  And this...  Let me tell you something.  Something I have seen, my opinion on Dominic Barbera, he is the guy who is constantly smiling 
[00:18:30]  and laughing out in public.  He's got the big smile on, like, it's all right.  The pat on the back.  The, hey, how you doing?  No matter how much hatred there is towards him by whoever he's approaching, it's always,  hey, how you doing?  And the big smile, and behind that has to be just misery and loneliness and a messy divorce, 
[00:19:00]  which I don't care who you are.  If you're involved in a messy divorce, you aren't that smiling guy.  You're in hell.  He's putting on this fake face of happiness when he's out.  I'm sure he smiled when he walked in with the police officer.  Arrest that woman.  Ha ha.  I got one.  Chalk one up for Dominic.  Hey, hey, why are the cuffs on me? 
[00:19:30]  And there he went.  There.  Off to jail for violating an order of protection.  How about, if you want to do something like that, you call the cops, you tell them what happened,  and have the police go to her.  Right.  And you don't get within the certain amount of restraining order.  Thank God, knock wood, I've never had a restraining order against me.  This has been going on for a while with him.  I guess you've got to pay attention to it.  It sounds like she's a bit of a nightmare, which is just perfect. 
[00:20:00]  Well, here's the problem.  Which is just perfect.  I know her, too.  She worked for Dominic, and she was the one that was in the courtroom 90% of the time.  For your case.  For my case.  And when I tell you, this is a no-nonsense broad.  Really?  Wowie kazowie.  Oh, is she an attorney?  Oh, yeah.  He was married.  I believe this is how it went.  He was married to his wife at one point. 
[00:20:30]  And then he got mixed up with this Leslie girl that worked for him.  Worked for him.  And they hooked up.  Wound up getting married.  And she is a divorce attorney.  So she knows every trick in the book.  I've seen it.  I've had experience with this woman.  She wasn't pleasant.  And, oh!  It wasn't fun.  When I saw her, it was almost like I didn't know who I wanted to see less. 
[00:21:00]  Her or Dominic.  Wow.  That's how bad it got.  With the hand trucks of fucking files they would bring in.  Hand trucks.  What the hell was she going to do with that?  I don't know, but my lawyer would come in like I would go into history in high school  with one sheet of paper and a pencil.  Yeah.  Like, hey!  Did you feel like you...  And I have to borrow it.  Did you feel like you were fucked?  Oh!  Really?  Spread them, Anthony.  Spread them.  Your lawyer's coming in with one folder with two pieces of paper.  It's pretty much what it was. 
[00:21:30]  And one paper is falling out, and now he has to awkwardly bend down and pick it up.  He's citing cases from television.  I, I, I, my lawyer, Jiminy Cricket.  Perry Mason was his best friend.  Oh!  Yeah.  Horrid.  And then, uh, you know, Dominic would come in and, and really, with hand trucks.  Hand trucks of those big brown lawyer boxes that hold all those big brown envelopes and  pulling out, whack, whack, wow, on the table, just wham, wham, these piles of files. 
[00:22:00]  I'm looking at him going, what could that possibly be?  I bet that's intimidation, half of that.  Oh, it's like blank sheets and, yeah.  Sure.  Shit like that.  And you're a lawyer?  Frrrr!  One, one piece of paper would come folded and crumpled out of his pocket.  Frrrr!  With just handwritten notes on it.  With a broken pencil.  You got a sharpener, your honor?  No.  Did you have faith in his ability?  Things he wants to accomplish that day in court.  I just knew, I'm trying to think, like, maybe I could save some money by not paying two really 
[00:22:30]  good lawyers, so I'll just pay her, you know, a really good lawyer.  And save money on yours?  And save money on mine, and hopefully, hopefully this will be over before people realize whose  lawyer is better.  No, it didn't work that way.  Three years I was with my cousin Vinny.  It was just...  Is that how long you had your lawyer for?  Oh, yeah, man.  Three fucking years.  And that's how long I had to pay for her lawyer.  That's disgusting, man. 
[00:23:00]  It made no sense.  It was disgusting.  When the whole thing's over and you, like, have a settlement that, of course, you can't  talk about the ins and outs, but it's a settlement.  Yeah.  It hasn't gone to trial.  The judge hasn't made a decision.  You and the other person settled on an agreed contract.  And then you realize that in that contract, you then have to pay for every screwing you  got by her lawyer. 
[00:23:30]  Like, every time you walked in there and the wife's lawyer fucked you over, you paid for  that.  Mm-hmm.  It's beyond me.  And to write that check, you're just biting your lip, you're biting everything, you're  biting your hand, you're just...  It's just too much to deal with.  Why does the court system allow this to happen?  It's lazy.  I just don't understand it.  I think it's lazy.  I don't understand.  It is laziness. 
[00:24:00]  It's they just want cases...  They want cases in and out.  Get them in, get them the fuck out.  But yours wasn't in and out?  No, no.  Exactly.  It wasn't in and out because I wanted to deal with it on a level of a court with a judge  that listens to your side of the story, listens to their side, and bases her decision  on what she hears, and not two lawyers and lawyers' accountants talking facts and figures 
[00:24:30]  that don't even exist yet, which might be in the future, maybe, with this great dependable  business we're in.  Oh, wow.  Just the fucking...  The security...  The job security we have.  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, I believe right after we settled, we got fired, which was great.  Oh, so you didn't have to pay, obviously, because it was a...  No!  You still have to.  Oh, no.  Ann had to pay.  It was just...  Oh, boy, did he pay.  ...a nightmare. 
[00:25:00]  And the fact that he is going through this, and I know that no matter how he smiles and  how he presents himself in front of the cameras and on Howie's show and everything, I just  know that no human being can go through that situation and not be miserable and not be  stressed out and just have it occupy your mind 100% of your day. 
[00:25:30]  And that gives me a little solace, as they say.  I do like seeing karma come and bite someone in the ass every so often.  If he's trying to get her arrested in a bagel shop, you know he's going through hell.  You know it's evil.  You know it's evil, right?  And like I said, this ain't her first time at the rodeo, boys.  You know, she's been around the block when it comes to illegal wranglings.  She was pretty cold in that courtroom.  Oh, my God.  A bit frigid.  Just sitting there. 
[00:26:00]  So you had to see the ex...  ...arm around the ex-wife when she'd get a little upset.  Ah!  Oh, yeah!  Comforting her.  Comforting.  And what'd you get on your side?  I got the one sheet of paper and, Anthony, do you have a pencil?  That was it.  Hey, how you doing?  Well, we're gonna fucking...  You were just watching your lawyer's hair fall out because of all the stress he was going  through.  Not the stress you were going through.  Oh, yeah.  When did you realize that your lawyer was in way over his head? 
[00:26:30]  Day three.  Really?  Yes.  Just like...  Day three.  When I realized their filed pile was getting very thick and mine was remaining the same.  You were hoping he would find some files to balance it out?  Something.  Something.  And he seemed to be a lot more concerned with the crown molding going up in his office.  Oh, really?  That I was, you know, writing checks for, I gather.  You like discussing that?  Yeah, look at that. 
[00:27:00]  And I'm just like...  The crown molding.  Meanwhile, you know, you get charged by the ten minutes with lawyers.  If it's eleven minutes, then you're twenty minutes.  Right.  You know, it's every ten minutes you're getting charged.  So they don't back it down to ten minutes?  They go up?  No, there's no rounding down with a lawyer.  They never round down.  They always round up.  They round up, up, up.  If they do a fucking one-minute phone call, it's a ten-minute phone call.  And believe me, it doesn't sound like much, but it adds up pretty quickly.  Sure.  And then you're just sitting there as he's going, 
[00:27:30]  So, how's the show going?  And how's this and that?  I'm just going to go, tick-tock, tick-tock, cha-ching, cha-ching.  I don't want to talk about the show.  Right.  I want to talk about the fact that I'm embroiled in a horrid divorce, and I need you working.  It was terrible.  Oh, God.  Well, it's over, though.  Thank God.  Oh, God.  Thank God it's been over for a while.  This is a good question. 
[00:28:00]  Let's go to Rob in Garden City.  Rob?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Rob.  Yeah, Anthony, have you always hated Dominic Barber, even before the divorce hearing?  Because I'm just curious why you didn't try to get him for yourself instead of this guy, you know, that, like you said.  Well, I made a rookie mistake, is what I did, and went on the cheap, thinking that because there were really no assets at all, there were no children involved, I had a leased vehicle, and I was renting a house in Huntington. 
[00:28:30]  I assumed, silly me, that this would all be done very quickly.  Lickety-split.  Lickety-split.  You know, I have my job, and I have to, I understand there would be some type of support payment.  But I didn't think it was going to be dragged on for three years with postponements so that my contract would come up for renewal, and they could use that as leverage against me. 
[00:29:00]  I thought it was the second we split up from that point forward didn't mean anything.  Sure.  It was just from that point back.  During the marriage years, that's what you base your settlement on, but no, apparently it was based on my millions upon millions of dollars of potential future earnings as I was being ushered out the door by Viacom. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  And by the way, Dominic, we never lived up to that potential.  Yeah, Dominic, thanks.  Thanks for figuring, I like, your account was real accurate.  I think you said we were going to make $150 million each or something.  Well, you were going to make a little more, apparently.  Oh, really?  That was something that was figured in.  Well, pushing these buttons is a very tough job.  That I think it was.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  No, didn't he try to also get, like, if she died, like, her family get paid or something like that?  Yeah, I can't go into the ins and outs of things, but there were certain things, and there are in many divorce settlements, there are certain things that each lawyer's side will come up with that are ludicrous. 
[00:30:00]  Just ridiculous.  I guess it's safe to say that you made, like, one of the worst assumptions in your life.  I made an assumption that I could get a lawyer kind of on the cheap, and then when I heard that she had retained Dominic Barbara, I started shitting my pants a bit.  Because from listening to Howard and listening to Dominic on Howard for many years, I understood then that I was going to be dealing with a problem, which it abso-fucking-lutely was. 
[00:30:30]  This guy likes the limelight.  He wasn't going to back down.  He is that smiling guy that will pat you on the back.  Hey, why don't you do that imitation of me?  Yeah, you do me.  Your Honor, Your Honor, you've got to hear him.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He actually said that in the court?  He is looked at by other lawyers, like this guy that comes in.  He's the TV and radio guy and stuff, and they just—I've seen lawyers shake their heads, like, oh, my God. 
[00:31:00]  This guy—what is he doing?  He wanted you—  Your Honor, he does an impression of me.  Go ahead, Anthony, do it.  He wanted you to do that?  Yes!  Did you do it?  No!  I would have—  You should have.  Yeah.  Might have knocked a few hundred thousand off.  I know.  Maybe that was a mistake, too.  I would have lost—  I should have fucking put on some tap shoes and done fucking—I should have done Riverdance.  Oh, my God.  Right out the door? 
[00:31:30]  Just out the door.  Da-da-da-da-da-da!  You should have said, okay, do you have an apple pie?  Just eat, like, a big, fat fuck.  Yeah, I'll imitate you.  Yeah, give me a buffet, Judge.  Anthony, I'm sorry.  I find it hilarious that when you ran into him in AC and he's trying to act like your buddy and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, I've been looking at him with, like, total disgust.  Like, how can you even approach him?  Yeah, I'm still—I was still paying off the accent. 
[00:32:00]  He comes into a restaurant.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Why don't you back up before that, though?  And then you can tell that part of it.  Right after the settlement, it finally goes down after three hell years for Anthony.  The guy calls our show the next day.  Mm-hmm.  Trying to be, like, Ant's pal.  Anthony was a complete gentleman.  Through this whole process.  I must say, yeah, I was a gentleman, all right.  Anyway, so he, right off the bat, called right after the settlement.  Yeah, yeah.  And then—  He likes publicity.  Then a few years later, you saw him in AC.  I saw him in a casino. 
[00:32:30]  He just walked up to my table.  Anthony, how you doing?  Hey, you got any luck?  Any luck here?  Yeah, why?  I'm trying to win your bill, motherfucker.  You should have said, no, you're still standing, so I guess I'm still having bad luck.  Yeah, and then it just reminded me that no matter what blackjack winnings I was making that night, I wouldn't be able to really keep it.  Would you, if you heard that he went to jail for something and was brutally raped, would it sadden you? 
[00:33:00]  Well, let's see, if he went to jail and was brutally raped, I don't think I'd be upset.  And let's say the details came out, one of the guards found it in action and said that apparently the man was fucking his bottom and then his mouth and then back to his bottom.  Oh, ass to mouth, back to ass, with some tearing of the rectal tissue.  A lot of it.  No, I don't think it would upset me. 
[00:33:30]  Almost like when the gentleman pulled out of the anus to go to the mouth, he pulled ass skin like loose toilet paper.  Jesus.  It looked like a kite, his asshole skin looked like a kite hanging off the man's dick.  A kite tail.  That's what it looked like, just a big pink sock.  Yeah, with that, I've been pink sock.  Would that upset you?  Oh, Jesus.  No, I don't think that would upset me that much.  No.  No.  Let me go to Ed. 
[00:34:00]  You're not going to believe this one, Anthony.  Ed, what do you got for Anthony?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, Ed.  What up, Ed?  Yeah, listen, I used Dominic as my lawyer in my divorce.  And you want to talk about an ass fucking, oh my God.  Anthony's totally on the money with the boxes of paperwork.  Yeah.  And hand trucks and stuff like that.  Yep, hand trucks.  Oh my God, it's unbelievable.  But that's not what I called for.  You know, Anthony, some of your divorce was in some of the local papers, wasn't it? 
[00:34:30]  Yes, it was.  Well, Dominic has those paper clippings framed hanging in his office.  He has the news clippings framed in his office.  He has clippings from Jessica Hahn's divorce, or like high-profile divorces that he did,  and you have made the wall of Dominic.  Oh, look at that, Ed.  I'm honored, I must say.  Congratulations, buddy.  I'm honored.  Is it the one with me coming, walking out of the courtroom looking like a complete beaten man? 
[00:35:00]  Something like that.  With a cigarette in my mouth and my hands in my pocket.  It was like a cold day.  And I'm at the top of the stairs, and it's the same stairs.  I wish I would have gotten, who is that, Bruno Tattaglia's fucking finish on the stairs?  Or was it, uh...  Was that Stracci?  It might have been Stracci, yeah.  At the top of the courthouse stairs, because it was the same courthouse on The Godfather,  where he gets shot, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Coming out of the courthouse, and he gets shot on the stairs.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah.  I was walking down those stairs, and I'm thinking,  I just would have rather had the fucking hitman come out and just level the gun at me.  That would have been better than what you went through.  Yeah.  All right, Ed.  Thank you, sir.  Have a great day, guys.  Bye-bye, Eddie.  Oh, let's say hi to Jeremy in Kansas.  Jeremy.  Jeremy in Kansas.  Jeremy, let's go.  Yeah.  Hi.  Dominic married Leslie, then he divorced her, then he remarried her. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, is that the one he married twice?  Yeah.  Wow.  This guy, uh...  That doesn't seem smart.  Is she pretty?  I couldn't see beauty in her.  I couldn't see beauty in her.  It's like saying a tiger is a wonderful animal, isn't it?  Sure.  But if it's ripping your throat out, you can't look at it and appreciate its beauty at that time. 
[00:36:30]  You're absolutely right.  You'd be...  All you're thinking is, this tiger is ripping my throat out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's hard to look at the nice coloring and the eyes and the wonderful coat.  Why would you go back and marry her a second time?  Oh, dude, I don't get it.  Would you ever marry your ex a second time?  It looks like he's going to kill me.  I couldn't speak for a second.  I swear I couldn't speak when you asked that for a second.  Look, we all make mistakes, but why would you go back to your mistake? 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  Nice.  Nice one, Jimmy.  Son of wet.  Let me, uh...  Feels that way, too.  Oh, God.  There was no way in hell.  Let's go to David in Charlotte.  David.  Hey, this tells you how subhuman some of these attorneys are, that he could come in and tear  you a new asshole, and then the next fucking day, act like he's your best friend. 
[00:37:30]  That's just amazing.  He was acting like he was my best friend, like, through the whole thing.  That's what it is.  Like, it wasn't...  I didn't want to look or hear from them unless it was some type of legal talk.  But I think a tactic that he used is this buddy thing where he'll come up and he'd, like,  he'd, like, grab your shoulder and kind of hug you, like, hey, and pull you back and forth.  So you're just kind of, like, why... 
[00:38:00]  He's doing this to...  Like, I interpreted it as he's doing this to put me down a notch.  Like, he's grabbing me and giving you a little, like, how you doing shoulder hug.  And meanwhile, you're the guy that's destroying my life at this point.  There's no how you're doings.  No.  No.  Go ahead.  Take your hand trucks and shit.  None.  Pile them on the table and let's get these proceedings on the fucking road. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Let's go to Kim on Long Island.  Kim.  Hey, gentlemen.  How are ya?  All right.  First time.  I just want to say I'm a lawyer from Long Island.  I live in Jersey now, but I used to work out of the family court.  And Dominic Barber, when he used to walk in, it was like, put the crown and the robe on.  It was like he thought he was just the king.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of the court staff really didn't like him, thought he was a judge.  And a lot of the judges would just be like, oh, I got to deal with this guy. 
[00:39:00]  On top of it, I went to law school with his son.  And he is a budding Dominic, if I can tell you.  Oh, yeah.  He strutted around the law school like his shit didn't stink.  So it was pretty funny.  Another one in the pipe.  Great.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, another one coming up, up and coming, his son.  And I just have to say, I used to practice family law.  I don't do it much now.  But, Anthony, I really think what happened to you in your divorce is disgusting.  I have worked with a lot of women who really, in this day and age, really should not be getting the kind of alimony that they get. 
[00:39:30]  And I just, I really, it's really unqualified at this time when you have opportunities for education and employment to be leeching off your husband like that.  So, ladies, get a job.  Yeah, a lot of women have this, you know, they don't want the glass ceiling in place in the corporate world.  And they want to be treated as complete equals.  You could get fucked in the workplace if you hang up a picture that they find offensive.  It's this whole thing where, you know, they want to be treated as complete equals in the workplace. 
[00:40:00]  They want their say.  They want, if something insults them, they want it taken care of immediately, just like the boys.  But when it comes to divorce, it's just this archaic system of the poor damsel in distress that can't do anything by herself and, please, the man has to help me.  And in every other aspect of life in 2010, it would be an insult to treat a woman like that in the workplace, at home, anywhere. 
[00:40:30]  But in a divorce court, you turn the clock back.  You turn the fucking clock back and the man is obligated to take care of the poor little waif that can't do it for herself.  And it's disgusting.  Did your ex better herself in the last 10 years?  I absolutely have no idea what she is doing. 
[00:41:00]  She had a great opportunity.  I wonder if she bettered herself with the money she was making.  You know, you've got to wonder.  Because in the realm of things, I believe it was a lot of money.  So hopefully, for her sake, you know, she took care of things.  And, you know, bettered herself, maybe got an education, just things like that.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Well, that would have proved she was the victim, you know, if she moved on with her life and got an education and learned to drive.  That would have been good.  And somehow got herself in a place where she was self, you know, sufficient.  That's why, Opie, I only wish her the best when it comes to, you know, that.  And I hope she did sock some money away, enough to, you know, keep the house and get an education and perhaps go into a career instead of just a job. 
[00:42:00]  Sure.  Something like something like that.  You know.  So I'm hoping.  That's nice of you.  I'm just hoping for the best.  That's really quite sweet.  Yeah.  You know, that's good.  Wish her well.  Yeah.  Only, only. 
[00:42:30]  No hard feelings.  Sounds like you're over it, which is nice.  You only, only have the best intentions.  Is that our new bit?  Yeah, apparently.  It seems so.  Poor Ant's neck.  Poor Ant's got a sore neck, apparently.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to stop.  I got a crutch that is killing me.  I got to stop saying apparently.  Why?  I'm noticing, I'm saying apparently, it's got to be 30 fucking times a show. 
[00:43:00]  Apparently.  You're saying apparently.  Apparently.  Too many times.  And I've noticed it, and it's bugging the shit out of me.  I just keep saying it.  I say apparently when I'm talking about my parents.  You asshole.  It is a weird, apparently, it's something that a lot of comics use when they're trying to sound smart.  Although, I certainly don't think that's what you're doing.  No, it's just, it's just, within the past, I don't even know how long, but it's just come up like, yeah, so apparently, he's doing this. 
[00:43:30]  And then, apparently, the terrorists, and apparently, the police were, shut up with the apparently, Anthony.  Here's why.  Apparently, you're an asshole.  Litigious society, it's, when you're so paranoid about being sued, apparently.  Oh, it kind of.  It's an automatic thing, like, well, from what I hear, I say that a lot, apparently, from what I hear.  It's such a reflux.  Yeah, that's a good word to say a lot.  You know?  It keeps you safe.  Clit hat's better.  Sure.  Sure.  Let's go to John in Florida. 
[00:44:00]  John?  Hey.  Apparently, John's on the phone.  What's up, John?  That's right.  I hear John's on the phone, apparently.  That guy in, he was from Michigan.  He had four kids.  Found out two of them weren't even hit biologically.  Oh, no.  Judd said keep paying.  So this guy gets a divorce.  He has four kids.  And he's paying child support.  And then it comes out, after the case or whatever, that two of the kids weren't even his biologically.  And the judge said, well, that doesn't matter.  You still got to pay child support, right? 
[00:44:30]  Right.  That's Michigan.  Michigan's the worst state in the union.  That's pretty amazing, huh, Ant?  Can you imagine that?  No.  Now you're paying for somebody else's kids?  Paying for someone else's kids.  Wow.  Fuck that.  That sucks.  Can you imagine?  No.  I wonder if he bailed himself out.  He probably did.  He's got enough money.  He probably got arrested.  Oh, Dominic?  Yeah.  I wonder what the resolution.  I'm sure he's out already.  I wonder what the resolution of that is. 
[00:45:00]  You know what?  We're laughing here today.  He probably loves it.  He's like, because now he knows he's in the papers again and maybe on some local TV.  And he loves that shit.  He does seem to love that.  He probably did it on purpose.  I don't know, certainly.  But he probably did it on purpose because he's like, oh, I haven't been in the spotlight  in a while.  Yeah.  He does seem to love being in the public eye.  And for some reason, during the divorce, he would bring up in the courtroom things like  his TV show that was coming up. 
[00:45:30]  Remember, he had some kind of legal TV show.  Honestly, I don't remember.  It was on court TV, I believe.  I really don't even remember.  And he would talk about cases and shit like that.  But why would that come up in the courtroom?  I don't know.  It has nothing to do with you.  But he would.  He would just come up with this stuff that had nothing to do with the case or me or anything,  but just would take up time.  Yeah.  Who knows?  It's terrible.  Bobo.  Yeah, this is a Bobo. 
[00:46:00]  I'm trying to search for the legal, but it's difficult to convince one to hop on the train  and head into the show.  Wait, what?  Oh, no.  What have they done?  What have they done?  You know, when Bobo just calls with something we don't have any clue as to what he's talking  about, we look over at Danny, Trap Dog and Danny, possibly Sam, and just go, oh, no.  What did you say, Bobo?  Could you repeat that, please? 
[00:46:30]  No, Travis asked me to stop by today, but they told me that if I want to stop by today,  I got to bring in an illegal.  All right, so are you having any success getting an illegal alien?  Nope, I don't have any success.  I've been trying to convince many to head on the train and head into the studio, and I've  been even trying to use it, trying to even convince them.  I say, hey, you want to be on the radio?  I can do that right now.  I can bring you right now. 
[00:47:00]  Well, how about we talk to an illegal alien?  You got one right there?  It is Cinco de Mayo.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I'm trying to find one right now.  For some reason, now it seems to be a bit quiet, but they start coming by.  The best way to find an illegal, I think, is just to walk up and go, let me see your papers.  Yeah, do that.  Hold on, now.  Hold on, I think there's one here.  All right. 
[00:47:30]  I hear Bobo got punched in the face.  There's one, I think, selling newspapers.  All right.  Let's ask him.  He's got to be.  Make sure we can hear him on the phone.  Interview him.  Let's see if he's an illegal.  I'll put this person on the phone, all right?  Excuse me, ma'am.  You want to be on the radio?  No, no, no.  I'm on radio right now.  Bobo, ask her if she's illegal.  Ask her.  Oh, she's too busy selling this.  I don't know.  Bobo, ask her if she's an illegal alien. 
[00:48:00]  Please.  They want to know if she's illegal.  They want to know.  Just you ask.  Yeah, I asked, all right?  She said, she said, yeah.  She's illegal?  No, legal.  Ask her.  Don't say they want to know.  Just say to her.  Walk up to her and go, can I see your papers?  Oh.  Right, right.  Say, can I see your papers?  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  My papers.  What are you doing? 
[00:48:30]  Bobo, go home and go to bed.  Just go home and go to bed.  Go home and go to bed.  What are you doing?  These fucking guys put Bobo through hell.  Put your head back on your pillow and fucking fall asleep with your glasses still on.  What's the matter with you?  Your party favor nostril hairs. 
[00:49:00]  Bobo.  Yeah?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Are you all right?  I'm all right.  I'm just trying to, still trying to search, so.  All right, well.  He's searching.  Do you want him searching for illiteracy?  No, I don't.  Yeah, this is going to end well.  Retarded.  Autistic.  Punched in the face.  Opie and Anthony show.  No.  I don't want this to continue.  Would that be the headline you think?  Of course it would.  What do you think it would be?  What would be the story? 
[00:49:30]  A mentally, people are saying that a mentally challenged man was goaded by the Opie and Anthony  show to engage in racist behavior by asking Spanish Americans or Latin Americans to show  their papers while the hosts encouraged him and laughed.  Apparently he made comedy fodder, his pants have been pulled off, and his penis has been  spit on by an Asian American comedian.  What do you fucking want to lose this gig to? 
[00:50:00]  Go home, Bobo.  You think that would be a problem?  It would be a, nobody would come to our defense.  Bobo, go home is right.  Nobody would come to our defense.  Who would come, what do you think Sirius is going to go, well, we're sticking by the  guys right now because we do understand that the retarded man would pull his penis out  in studio frequently and pre-cum would leak on the rug with her name on it.  After the lawyers repeatedly said no fluid, he just couldn't help himself watching lesbian 
[00:50:30]  porn.  He's a retard.  Is it true pre-cum dripped on our actual names?  That's not nice.  That's fucking horrible, dude.  He sneezes and his dick just leaks.  His fucking eyes and dick water simultaneously when he eats fucking hot food.  And then just add in racism to that and you got a great story.  Yeah, because he says, at first the retarded man known as Bobo, do you know how bad that  would look in fucking print?  Do you know how bad? 
[00:51:00]  Known as Bobo.  Known as Bobo.  Are you trying to say there's no rocket scientist out there named Bobo?  No.  No.  Literally, you have to be a single IQ dummy to answer to that.  And they would say, walked up and said, innocently, they want to know, and they angrily corrected  the mentally challenged man and said, no, demand her papers, as he was struck and his glasses  fell off.  Holy shit.  Goodbye, apartment. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, fuck.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Go home.  Go home.  Speak to no one.  Go home.  Wait, let's think about this another minute.  I think we did.  Bobo, how close to home are you?  No, I'm a bit of a distance, but I got to take a bus to head back.  Why are you?  Where are you?  I'm right by the train station.  But how did you get there?  I took a bus out there. 
[00:52:00]  Why did you go out there?  To the train station?  Because you knew that's where the illegals would be?  Yeah, that's usually a good spot.  I usually go by the train station.  A good spot.  It's like he's fishing.  He found a good spot.  I found a good spot.  I'm trying to keep it secret.  You think it's a safe good spot or a bit dangerous?  He found illegals near a train station?  That can't be good.  It seems to be a relatively good spot. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  All right, Bobo.  Go home.  Yeah.  Call us when you get home.  Yeah.  Take a nap.  Relax.  Have a fucking piece of fattening food.  Speak to no one.  Speak to no one.  Speak to no one.  Even if you take a cab, just nod directions like a fucking dolphin.  Don't say that because he'll do that now.  And then the cabbie will be all frustrated.  He'll do whatever you say.  All right, Bobo.  All right.  Just go home.  Go to sleep.  All right. 
[00:53:00]  No problem.  All right.  It's a fucking Manchurian candidate.  My gut hurts, Jimmy.  It's so fucking hard.  All right, El Stupido.  Sorry I wasn't able to accomplish this.  You did fine.  Goodbye.  Godspeed.  It's perfect.  Homeward bound jar.  We are now relinquishing any responsibility we have for anything you do from this moment  forward.  But I must say you did let down the show. 
[00:53:30]  No, no, no.  I'm sorry about it.  I'll try to do something else.  Yeah, we'll have you come in.  You can do whippets with spray paint cans.  I'm sure that'll be a fucking our next contest idea.  All right, Bobo.  Go home.  We have nothing to do with this one, Bobo.  Go home.  There he goes.  Okay.  Oh, is that funny?  You know, speaking of illegal aliens.  Yeah.  I know we played it once, but I want to play it again.  Stupid Genesis had that song, Illegal Aliens. 
[00:54:00]  And it's Cinco de Mayo.  You got the Arizona thing happening.  And this song was out there.  It was on the pop charts.  It did really, really well.  And it's a really, it's pretty much a racist song.  It was racially insensitive these days.  Don't you think?  Yes.  I mean, I don't care, but I'm just saying.  He does a little, like, fake Mexican accent.  Right.  There's no way a pop group could put a song out like this today.  And it would be one of the hottest songs in America. 
[00:54:30]  Yep.  People would be like, what the fuck is wrong with this band?  Where are your papers?  You want to listen to it for a few seconds?  Yeah, let's hear it.  You got it there, Trav Dog.  Smackin' Bobo.  Oh.  This is Phil Collins.  What?  What a faggot Phil Collins is. 
[00:55:00]  This song is horrible.  If you wrote this as a parody. 
[00:55:30]  Let's pause this for a second, yeah.  If you wrote this as a parody as a radio guy.  Yeah, you would be fired.  You'd be in trouble.  Yeah, you'd be fired.  Definitely in trouble.  Maybe fired.  A racially insensitive parody song about illegal aliens was played on a radio show.  And he's trying to sing like he has a little Mexican in him. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  But then his Mexican accent goes into some kind of Jamaican thing for a little while.  And tequila.  A new pack of cigarettes.  Cigarettes.  Yeah, he's trying to do that.  You'd get fired.  Yeah.  Let me hear a little more of that.  Yeah.  Choose.  Arizona State song, by the way. 
[00:56:30]  They just adopted it as their state song.  I guess we're going to have to play the whole thing.  Yeah.  Horrendous, that song.  Isn't that amazing?  Dennis D. in Jersey.  Genesis are British.  I'm sure they don't give a shit, Ope. 
[00:57:00]  Well, that's not the point.  The point is that a band wouldn't fucking put out a song like that.  The times have changed.  And like I was saying.  A popular band, too.  Genesis was fucking huge when that came out.  Yeah.  Huge.  As a parody.  As a parody.  That would get you in trouble.  Right.  There would be Mexican groups.  And the British are more politically correct than we are.  Yes.  Don't think that the British are fucking hip.  They're even worse than they are.  Oh, the Islamic coddling douches they are over there.  Yeah, they are worse.  They're all, they're like fucking, like Gavin Newsom in San Francisco. 
[00:57:30]  I mean, they're all like that.  Yeah.  Who was the fucking mayor of London?  Ken Livingston at one point.  Oh.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our friends.  Shut up.  Speaking of Arizona, they're changing the name of their team for the  playoffs there for a game.  Oh, brother.  Did you guys hear about that?  Sure.  What are they going to be called for the game?  El fucking.  Los Suns.  Los Suns.  Los Suns.  That's good.  Los Suns. 
[00:58:00]  Los Suns.  Because I'm sure the Phoenix Suns would hire illegals.  And I'm sure Major League Baseball would hire illegals to play for one  fiftieth or one one hundredth of what players are making right now.  And I'm sure the players unions would have nothing to say about that.  I'm sure the players unions would go, you know what?  Give that pitcher an opportunity.  I know he's not legal.  How?  Let him play.  That's it.  Let him play for a few, few shekels.  You phony motherfuckers.  Shut up. 
[00:58:30]  And they can't even go all in.  Los Suns.  What's the Spanish word for Sun?  I forget.  I took six years of Spanish.  I should know.  Sol.  What?  I guess it's Sol, right?  So Los.  Sol.  Sol.  Los Sols.  Or Sols.  Sols.  You can't just put an S at the end of it.  Los Sols?  Sol.  Sol.  Sol.  Sol.  Sol.  Yeah, but no one would know what that meant.  So that's what they're doing for their playoff game. 
[00:59:00]  Adobe.  That's terrific.  That's very poignant of the Suns to do.  All right.  All this phony protest.  Even if you don't like the Arizona law, I would just love to see.  I know that they get a lot of illegals here and they make them citizens before they can  play.  And then they're bound by the fucking players unions.  But let's just see how they would fucking react if illegals were playing.  And instead of making the minimum Major League Baseball salary, let's say you're paying  them $40,000 or $50,000 a year, which would be enough in their own country to have a life  like a king.  Let's see how fucking fast these phony players unions would be up in arms about it. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  Shut your faces.  Nice.  Uh, Bobo's back.  Uh, Bobo.  Hope he's home.  Listen to this.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Why are you calling back?  I, I, I, there's money I have to spend to get here, to get, to get, just to get to the  train station alone.  How, how much did you spend to get to the train station, Bobo?  I spent about $12.  $12.  And you want that money back? 
[01:00:00]  You need the money?  Yeah, all right.  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll be willing to spend for that money, all right?  I'll come in and I'll do something for that money.  All right.  Where are you now?  I'm on, I'm at the Sunnyside train station, right in front of the turnstile.  Well, when I see you, all right, in front of the turnstile, I'll be so specific.  To the left of the Pepsi machine.  I got an idea.  We're gonna, we're gonna, like, uh, throw a bunch of dollar bills down this long hallway.  And as many, uh, dollar bills you could pick up with your pre-com, you know, have them  stick to your dick, you get to keep. 
[01:00:30]  You can't use your hands, obviously.  Whatever you, what was that?  You ever, you ever have a friend that could do the spit thing?  Like the three or four foot spit?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he can make it go pretty much right down to your fucking nose if you're laying on the  ground and suck it up.  Matter of fact, thank you, Bobo.  You want Bobo to come back?  Come back where?  Is he coming here to get the money?  Where are you going, Bobo?  Where are you, where are you headed, Bobo? 
[01:01:00]  Bobo?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, he didn't hang up.  What happened to Bobo?  Bobo.  What?  He's, uh, he's gone.  Um.  He's gone.  My friend.  He's gone.  My friend, my, my old, uh, high school friend, um, who listens to the show, he's down in Florida  now, he, Glenn Notice, he, uh, was on David Letterman doing that exact, uh, human trick. 
[01:01:30]  Like, he was able to get a fucking spit thing going, standing up, he could get it all the  way down to the floor, and I think he was able to pick up, like, uh, like, chips or something.  I forgot.  That's disgusting.  This goes way back.  Oh, no, no.  He said chips.  This goes way, way back, but he was able to pick him up off the floor using his spit or  something like that.  I, I don't even know if his human trick is still online, but he was known in our high school  as, fuck, he made it on Letterman with that dumb fucking trick of his. 
[01:02:00]  That's a, that's a disgusting trick.  It was pretty disgusting.  I don't know what it is about spit, but once it leaves your mouth, it, it can't go back  in.  Like, it's, it's in your mouth all the time.  But it's never really out of his mouth.  Yeah, work up some spit.  It's connected to his fucking mouth, though, still.  And then you swallow it and you swallow it, spit, but you'd never like put it in a cup  and then drink it.  But it was never out of his mouth officially.  I mean, I mean, it was never detached from his mouth.  No, once it, once it passes your lips, it's over. 
[01:02:30]  If you make a string of it, say, oh, you're one of those guys, you could do that.  Jimmy's doing like a, a, a lizard thing with spit almost down to his chin and then he pops  it back up.  He can make it snap out and then back in really quick.  I think Glenn had a drink.  That's what snot, though.  Like a frog.  I think, uh, I think Glenn had to drink a lot of orange soda to get, to get a nice  spit going.  It'd probably make him, like, all phlegmy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And fucking Letterman loved it.  He put him on his fucking show.  This goes back easily 20 years ago.  20 fucking years ago.  Some heavy cream. 
[01:03:00]  Uh, Bobo's back.  Let's say hi to Bobo.  Bobo's back.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah, yeah, sorry about that.  There was signal interference.  I understand.  Signal interference.  So what are we doing?  Maybe you should wear a tinfoil hat.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wow, that, is it still gross?  Yeah, with this, uh, nice little thing doing it.  It's not as gross when there's some, like, broad doing it.  Spit stringing gross on YouTube.  Yeah, that's gross.  The spit string is gross.  Well, that's the girl who's just spitting in your mouth.  Would you let a chick just spit in your mouth if her breath was fresh? 
[01:03:30]  No.  I'm not a spit in my mouth kind of thing.  I don't mind.  I don't mind.  But, uh...  Spit?  No.  You don't want dry breath in your face when you're spit drinking.  No.  Don't want cotton mouth.  Nah, I spit.  You don't want someone who spits, it just comes out really, really white, white, because  there's no fucking fluid in their mouth.  Just foam.  A little flecks of white smell.  Mine comes out brown, because I drink a lot of coffee.  Oh, yeah.  After coffee, forget it.  I missed that one, Danny. 
[01:04:00]  What's she doing?  She just touched her own clit with a spit string, I think, Anthony.  She's cute.  Yeah, she did it, like, right at the beginning.  She's lovely.  Getting info, Ant?  Yeah.  I can't even say his name.  He's from Queens.  Check out the video for Illegal Alien.  Phil, Mike, and Tony are wearing sombreros and Dirty Sanchez mustaches.  Yeah, yeah.  They got, like, fake mustaches and sombreros.  Why do you do that nowadays?  I wish you could, but you just can't.  Like a Black to the Future video that the cops always end up getting in trouble doing 
[01:04:30]  every few years.  Or firemen.  They think it's a good idea to do Black to the Future as a float in a parade, and they  all get in trouble.  Remember Blackula?  Blackula, yes.  Yeah, but this was the cops.  What was that?  Staten Island, was it?  Yeah, I think so.  Who thought that was a good idea?  Yeah, I got a good idea.  And that wouldn't cause any problems.  We'll do Black to the Future, and we'll all get on a DeLorean, and we'll dress like the  characters, but we'll be in blackface.  That can't, that won't make a problem, will it? 
[01:05:00]  I don't think the news will pick up on this one.  Yeah.  Fired.  Wow.  So fired.  All right, listen.  We got lots to do.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to give you the latest on the Times Square suspect there.  Maybe some apologizing will be going on.  While we'll break.  Maybe.  Jimmy was on Red Eye last night.  We got the clip.  And you were on Hannity, right?  Double duty yesterday?  Yeah, what happened, I taped Red Eye Monday, but it didn't air.  There was some kind of a breaking news thing that Fox ran. 
[01:05:30]  So I had to go in last night, and we re-taped the A Block, because since we first taped it,  they had caught this guy.  Yeah.  So we just re-taped the beginning, and we joked about it, and we just kind of re-did the beginning of the show,  the first half hour.  And then you did Hannity as well.  Went upstairs and did Hannity.  How was Hannity?  It was great.  Yeah?  It was great.  Yeah, man.  He's good.  People on the panel are nice, and I love doing his show.  Yeah.  And Ant's on tonight.  Ant's on tonight.  I'm on Hannity tonight at 9.  Dude, he said that tonight for some reason, in the intros, he said that for some reason you're  going to plug that this Friday my Borgata tickets go on sale. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, I said.  You don't need to do that.  I said I was going to say that Jimmy Morton's Borgata tickets go on sale this Friday.  For July 2nd and 3rd, it's so far off, but who wants to plug it this Friday?  10 a.m. fuckers, buy them!  Bret Michaels, released from the hospital, going to make a full recovery, the doctors are saying.  That's unbelievable.  I think we got one of Bret's guys calling our show a little later to talk about what Bret  Michaels went through the last couple of weeks. 
[01:06:30]  But basically, 20% of the people that get what he had, or I guess has because he's still  going through it, recover completely.  80% have something wrong after the fact.  Something a little amiss.  So Bret Michaels is a very, very lucky man today, and we'll talk to one of his guys in  about an hour or so.  So, very good news, because we really like Bret Michaels on this show, right?  He's become a friend of the show.  I think so.  He comes on, he does good radio for us, he's a fun guy. 
[01:07:00]  Last time he was in with Sharon.  Yeah.  And we all laughed and laughed.  I ran to the bathroom with three minutes left in our break.  Yeah.  Did you do a three minute mile?  I just realized you need a little more than three minutes to make sure everything is back  together.  Hunky-dory.  Right.  Did you have to do the... 
[01:07:30]  You notice I'm sitting on my side a little bit?  Oh, no.  You're doing the one cheek sit?  I just...  Oh, no.  Did you have to cut it off?  You see I'm leaning a little bit right now?  Wow.  Three minutes is not nearly enough time to do everything you need to do in there.  No baby wipes?  Oh, wow.  You know what?  I'm bringing in baby wipes.  Yeah, you have to.  This fucking company of ours.  Love ya.  Can they splurge on some toilet paper that doesn't rip the shit out of your asshole? 
[01:08:00]  Danny, right?  Yeah.  It's like sandpaper.  See, you don't take shits here, Anthony.  I know that about you.  Every once in a while, maybe you have to.  I have once in a blue moon, as they say.  I will go in there.  I'm good for two, maybe three every morning.  Danny, probably about the same.  Well, you know what?  I try to not do anything here.  Yeah, but you can't help yourself.  I try not to do anything anywhere, but sometimes you just kind of have to.  When nature comes a calling, you know, you can't fucking hold it in.  But it's definitely the cheapest possible toilet paper. 
[01:08:30]  Could someone get me a roll of toilet paper from the bathroom?  You probably haven't even noticed how bad this fucking stuff is.  I've been in there after some nights out.  I don't know how you could get toilet paper where the sheets are almost see-through and they cause damage.  That doesn't make sense.  It's like wiping your ass with cheap copy paper.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it doesn't really do anything.  It just kind of moves everything around.  You think I haven't had a horror episode in the bathroom after a night of drinking Guinness? 
[01:09:00]  Believe me, it comes out like it does out of the tap.  Yeah.  You look in the toilet and it actually has the waterfall.  Like a newly poured Guinness.  It's drafting in the toilet?  It's drafting in the toilet.  There's a head on top of the toilet.  And you try to make a shamrock on it.  It's just wonderful.  Yeah, move your ass around and make a shamrock like at the bar.  I mean, they give some of these idiots around here millions of dollars to do absolutely nothing for the company.  And I'm just talking generally right now because then they do hire people and they pay them well and they do a very good job for the company. 
[01:09:30]  But they can't fucking splurge on toilet paper?  That's not going to rip your ass apart?  That's how the stock price goes up.  Look at this.  Wow.  Look at that.  Look, I could see you.  Yeah, you could see through it.  I could totally...  I could...  Look, I could see my computer through it.  Sure.  But even though it's see-through, it does a world of hurt.  That does not necessarily mean it's soft.  Now, if you blew your nose...  Let's just put it this way. 
[01:10:00]  If you blew your nose with that toilet paper all day, you would have a chapped red fucking almost bloody...  You'd have the kid in the playground that has a cold nose.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Remember in school having to blow your nose with the brown paper towels?  Yes.  Have the absorbency of a brick?  And they're almost as soft?  Just horrible.  How about...  Those brown paper towels.  How about they get us some, I don't know, some softer toilet paper?  Yeah.  Please.  I like having that here. 
[01:10:30]  There we go.  It's really causing...  Distress.  Ugh.  A little distress.  Ugh.  On the heinie.  And Danny's right.  There's something to be said about absorption.  When they advertise absorption with the toilet paper...  Yeah.  This stuff just...  I'm trying not to be too gross, because I know people got their bagels and their fucking egg sandwiches right now.  Mmm.  But let's just say it just smears everything around.  It doesn't really...  Oh, God.  It doesn't really...  Ever since I got on the baby wipe train, I just... 
[01:11:00]  I don't understand how you could wipe your ass without it.  It's just like...  It's like, who thought this was a good idea?  Right.  You're just taking dry paper...  Right.  ...and rubbing it all over your asshole.  Like, I don't see how that's cleaning anything.  And the idiots that came up with the concept, baby wipes, couldn't figure out that everyone would enjoy that?  Yeah, not just baby.  They only figured out that adults could use it recently.  Fairly recently.  Yeah.  And they got rid of the baby part of the wipes in a lot of the brands. 
[01:11:30]  Now it's...  They just call them wipes or whatever.  Wipes.  Flushable wipes.  They call them flushable wipes.  Yeah.  They don't call it, like, cool ass.  But even if they did, I don't care.  I'd buy them anyway.  I like to do the baby wipe, toilet paper combo, because I find that to be the most effective way to clean things up.  That is good.  Yes.  You do need the combo.  And sometimes you need the pre...  To get everything started, baby wipe first.  Mm-hmm.  Sometimes, if you're burning, if you're burning down there, you gotta just kinda lay it in, lay it in to just prep the area for the toilet paper. 
[01:12:00]  It does depend on...  Then toilet paper.  And then finish the whole thing up with another baby wiping.  But then you gotta go dry, because then if you just pull your pants up, you gotta wet it.  You gotta dry.  You gotta dry off.  I don't like drying with the paper after the last wipe, so I'll sit there and maybe look at some apps. 
[01:12:30]  And just kinda let the air do it.  You let everything cool off.  Yeah, you let it all cool down.  It's like a reactor core.  You gotta let it cool slowly.  You know what?  And I've been saying this for months.  They don't wanna listen to me, but I know there's a serial killer that works here at this company.  Because in the morning, one of the toilets is so beat up, someone is a very angry man.  Are you talking about the one where it looks like someone's making a bird's nest in the toilet?  They make a huge bird's nest in the toilet. 
[01:13:00]  Safe to say, at least a roll of toilet paper.  Dude, that's a lot of paper.  Someone is a very angry man that works at SiriusXM.  I'm assuming he does some kind of night shift, because every morning, one of the toilets...  It's a horror show, Ant.  It's so fucking scary.  There's somebody that just wants to fucking destroy the toilet every night.  I think I have a picture of it on my phone.  Do you?  Was that compelling?  Probably not now, but I was going through some old photos.  We're not talking about a little extra toilet paper.  We're talking so much toilet paper that they can't flush it. 
[01:13:30]  And one of these poor fucking slobs has to go in probably with a gloved hand and clean the whole thing out almost every morning.  Almost every morning.  There's someone really angry that works here.  It honestly looks like someone threw a turban in the toilet and then just dumped Egg Foo Young on top of it.  Yeah.  It just looks...  It's disgusting.  Yeah.  That's disgusting.  And it's not one time.  I mean, how many times have you seen it?  Safe to say.  Multiple times to the point where it's definitely a pattern.  And it's to the point where it's kind of scaring me. 
[01:14:00]  Like, there's a person that works here that has some issues.  Why can't it just go into the water?  I don't understand that.  I don't understand it.  Why does it need to be, like, padded?  I don't...  Padded?  It's padded in the bowl, though.  He's not making a seat.  Maybe he doesn't like Splashback.  They have the toilet cover seats there.  Splashback.  He doesn't like Splashback.  He doesn't like Splashback.  So he's padding the water.  So when it falls, it just goes...  And no water goes up.  I'll take a picture next time it happens. 
[01:14:30]  I've been meaning to, but I haven't done that.  Do you ever have a perfect hit with Splashback?  Where it just...  It's a bullseye.  Oh, yeah.  Right back at you?  Yeah.  Makes you giggle.  Woo!  You go, kind of, woo!  All right, let's go to Nick in Philly.  Nick.  Opie.  Hey, buddy.  Try taking a shit on one of them spotter pots on a construction site.  Right.  You get halfway through, you look down, there's no toilet paper. 
[01:15:00]  You gotta wipe your ass with your fucking sock.  Oh, my God.  Your sock?  Is there anything worse than going into a port-a-john when it's 90 degrees out and they haven't  cleaned it?  And you see the clean schedule and it's like, it still has a day or two before they're coming  around?  I've been in ones that the clean schedule said 1969, August, Woodstock.  That shit is spoiled, man.  It's fucking shit.  It's spoiled.  Why does shit have to smell so fucking bad?  Because it's shit.  And all it needs is a little water.  You don't smell nothing for the most part.  You take that water away, though? 
[01:15:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah, when you have to do a waterless.  Now, on the job sites, I've told you about spackle buckets.  Yeah.  We'd have to use spackle buckets.  And, like, it's animalistic, the aroma.  What about when you shit and that blue stuff flashes up in your ass?  Yeah, we were talking about that.  The blue stuff.  We can handle that.  No problem.  All right.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  Let's go to John in Nebraska.  John. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing this morning?  All right, buddy.  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know, I took advantage of that free Best of XM preview deal.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys got me sold, man.  You guys are fucking funny.  Ooh, Josh from Nebraska.  How long have you been listening, Josh?  Just maybe three weeks or so.  I got to ask you, because, I mean, we never get to talk to the newer listeners.  It's like, I guess, what's the funniest thing you've heard us do in the first three weeks of listening to the Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:16:30]  Just the way.  Oh, he's a new listener.  Consider that your initiation, sir.  That's just your initiation.  He's right now looking at his phone going, oh, nerds.  Oh, they got me.  Why does that continue to work years later?  He's a new listener, yeah.  I don't understand.  Yeah, he's a new listener.  All right, well, do you want to take shit stories?  You want to talk about the Times Square bomber guy? 
[01:17:00]  Same thing.  Yeah, no kidding.  Lump of shit.  Let's go to Green Bay.  I brought Clorox wipes.  Yeah, I want to go to them.  You can't use that, you asshole.  I want to go to, Dave, stay on the line.  We're going to go to you next, but first, Green Bay.  What's up, Green Bay?  Morning, boys.  Man, I've been listening since the beginning, and I didn't see that fucking coming.  Yeah.  Right on, bro.  God, I love it every time.  And I feel, you know what, I got, hold on, I got to say, I feel like it's a really hack  bit. 
[01:17:30]  I don't want to do it anymore.  It's just, it's funny.  All right.  I want you to do it until somebody goes, oh, no.  I think it's only happened maybe.  Oh, no, yeah.  See, now us talking about it is going to fuck it up a little bit, but all right.  What do you got, Green Bay?  I worked at the toilet paper mill that caters to everyone's brown spiders through the country,  and that toilet paper right there is just recycled up medical papers and newspapers and  magazines, and they just boil the ink out, throw a little miracle softness in it, and 
[01:18:00]  boom, there you go.  Yeah, this is definitely recycled.  It's got, like, holes in it, too.  Yeah, this is.  Like, look at the holes in it, and there's wood pulp.  I would love to know the name of the brand.  Is there any way we can find out?  To give them a horrible plug, because this could be the worst toilet paper being used  in an office, because no one would buy this for their own use.  No one.  Would you buy that for your own use, Dan, to save a few bucks when you had no money?  No, I have fancy soft toilet paper.  I prefer toilet paper like this than just soft toilet paper. 
[01:18:30]  Soft toilet paper, I don't like.  You know what?  You can't get the one that is too soft, like the triple-ply fucking button-tuck fucking...  Well, I like how they, when you see commercials for toilet paper now, they sell you on the  fact that they, some toilet papers don't leave anything behind.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is basically just a commercial saying, hey, we won't put dingleberries in your ass  hairs if you use this one.  Yeah, so you do need something that's got a little fiber to it. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, because the last batch I just went through, oh boy, was it a mess.  I'd have to go take a shower after I wipe my ass with toilet paper, because I would have  like half a pound of toilet paper left in my hand.  Yeah, like things like Cottonelle and big, thick, puffy fucking Charmin.  Like, that isn't good.  It's terrible.  Because that's going to leave a lot of stuff behind.  Honestly, I was in the shower, and I was cleaning up, and I picked out a chunk of toilet paper  where I was actually amazed.  I was like, I can't believe this much was back there.  I like the wipes occasionally, too. 
[01:19:30]  I'll use them.  We're out of toilet paper right now.  I don't use them every day.  I probably should.  Oh, those are great to just use.  Grace invention ever.  Because my asshole feels slippery when I'm done.  Oh, it's nice.  No, then you go back to the toilet paper and soak everything back up.  That's a whole thing.  It's a process.  You go toilet paper, baby wipe, back to toilet paper, you're good to go.  You wet, you dry, your asshole doesn't know what to do.  Speaking of baby wipes, when Jimmy turned me on to the whole baby wipe thing, and I started  my trucking adventure, I went and grabbed a pack of baby wipes. 
[01:20:00]  Well, this was at a truck stop, and it ended up being like a big pack of what?  Like those wet naps?  You know, like you clean your hands off from tips?  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That motherfucker burned my asshole.  You got to watch what you put up there.  Speaking of which, I got to let you go, because speaking of that, here's Clorox guy.  Dave in Connecticut.  Dave.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  My wife bought some of the Clorox clean-up wipes, you know, you see in the disinfecting  ones, and they come in a real fancy package now with butterflies and everything. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  Right on the top of the lid, it says in bold letters, not to be used as a personal wipe.  Personal wipe, yes.  Yeah, so that means somebody somewhere had to do that.  The lawyers had to get involved and put that stupid message on top.  Bleach their asshole.  Yeah, who the hell would do that?  Do you know how much that would hurt?  Yeah.  Especially if your ass was chafed like a fucking vinegar or potato chip.  Ow.  You know who the hell would do that?  Most people, because they look just like the regular baby wipes, and you reach for it 
[01:21:00]  and realize way too late.  Yeah, but they smell like cum.  They really do.  This is...  You're landing with Clorox wipes on your face.  Okay, I want to know how much this costs.  The brand is called Torque.  T-O-R-K.  Torque?  What a horrible name for toilet paper.  Torque.  T-O-R-K.  That's good.  Universal.  Yeah, that's just your basic industrial send-it-out-in-a-giant-box toilet paper. 
[01:21:30]  If they spent, like, I don't know, a couple cents more per roll, we'd all be a lot happier.  This stuff really is not...  The bottom line.  You've got to think of the bottom line.  Oh, really?  Bottom line?  How about you yank a few of these shows that you thought were a good idea?  In lieu of toilet paper?  I can think of one I'd love to see go.  And then we could get some nice soft toilet paper in this joint.  Hey, guys, just to let you know, the phones still sound really bad. 
[01:22:00]  Well, the guys down the hall told me they checked everything, and there was a big improvement.  Maybe we have to tell somebody.  Yeah, we'll tell somebody without hurting their feelings.  Maybe they could keep tweaking until we get it right.  Thank you, Dave.  All right, have a good day.  And that's a real thing, by the way, because sometimes they get confused if we say something on the air, if it's real or not.  If that's real, please continue tweaking the phones and get them right.  We do a talk show.  Remember the days before the personal wipe where if you had a really bad session on the bowl... 
[01:22:30]  It went up.  Yeah, but you had to do the old crab walk to the sink.  Like, the toilet in the sink, if you had it right near it, you were okay.  But if the toilet was a little away from the sink, you'd have to get up and do the old crab walk, wet the toilet paper, get back on the bowl, and then do the...  But that was even like an art form, because if you wet the toilet paper too much, then you go back to what Danny was saying.  There's a shitload of little pieces of toilet paper. 
[01:23:00]  And you don't want a wicking process to happen where it's using the water to wick the disgustingness toward your fingers.  Right.  So you need to be holding dry toilet paper, yet have wet toilet paper on the spot that's going to get your hiney.  What do we know on the Torque toilet paper, Danny?  Oh, it's put out by Peter Torque from the Monkees.  It's 100% recycled.  Well, that's good.  Yeah, that's good.  That's great.  They only sell it in, like, obviously bulk. 
[01:23:30]  It's like, you know, you have to buy, like, cases and cases and stuff.  This one is Torque Universal, if that helps, because I see there's a lot of different brands.  How many rolls do you get for $88.98?  How many rolls?  Well, that's the big roll.  That's the big ridiculous...  That's a big 1,000-foot roll.  You get 12,000 feet of toilet paper.  12,000 feet of toilet paper for 90 bucks.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Torque Universal. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  It's safe to save.  See, this isn't even the right one, either, because that stuff is, like, one ply.  That's not even a second ply on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a 1,001 ply sheets.  Jesus.  1,001?  One ply.  You ever know anybody that just used one sheet?  Yeah, fucking...  Who started that campaign?  You can't spare a square.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Spare a square.  Ready for this?  Who uses one sheet?  Sheryl Crow, I believe, was the one that was trying to get America to use one fucking 
[01:24:30]  square.  One square.  Oh, stop it.  That's impossible.  Let me take one square.  You think that Lance Armstrong sitting on that bicycle seat all fucking day is using one  square?  Right.  He probably turned to her and said, look, dummy.  Look, dummy.  Oops.  I'm going to fall down on the floor.  Yeah, whatever.  It might start a fire.  All right.  Do we need to keep doing this?  I think we've covered toilet paper and shitting for the day. 
[01:25:00]  Actually, this guy, though, the little knowledge for the people that missed it the first time.  Chris in Western Bay.  Where's Western Bay?  It's just west of East Bay.  Chris?  Yo.  Western Bay.  Where is that?  Oyster Bay.  Oh.  Oh, Oyster Bay.  Oh, well, they wrote down Western Bay.  I know where Oyster Bay is.  Fucking non-Long Island motherfucker.  Yeah, what do you got, Chris?  All right.  Well, two things I got.  I heard about Anthony's car troubles over the weekend. 
[01:25:30]  We'll talk about that in a second.  I don't know if you guys mentioned it.  Yeah.  But a few weeks ago, you had a guy calling about how to shit properly.  You guys were talking about the dry ones, and this guy suggested you sit back properly  with your hands on your knees.  Changed my life.  Everyone's fluid.  Everyone's a good fluid, meaning comes out dry, one or two wipes, out.  Beautiful.  Jimmy told me, you got to get a little fucking...  I forgot what you have in your place, but you put your feet up a little bit.  Jimmy looks like he's going down on a luge, apparently. 
[01:26:00]  He stretches his legs out and leans back like a luge.  No, no, no.  It's like a little step.  So when I sit, I can just comfortably...  It's like my knees are raised.  So I almost look like a little V.  A little blubbery, fat-titted V.  Firing soft-serve shit into the toilet.  Wait, are you saying he sits forward or back?  No, when you sit up straight.  Picture sitting in the toilet.  Are you supposed to sit up straight back?  It doesn't matter.  I mean, you can lean...  I think as soon as you just slouch, it's kind of like the plumbing starts slouching. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, you can't slouch.  That can't be good, too.  It's like a...  I'd say it elevates your feet by about six inches or so, or five inches, so your knees  are up.  So it just helps my shit work its way through my plumbing and right out the door.  As I sit there and play QWERTY on my iPhone.  QWERTY?  You play QWERTY on your iPhone?  I love QWERTY on my iPhone.  QWERTY?  I play shuffleboard bowling on my iPhone as I'm doing it. 
[01:27:00]  I try to time it, too, where the shuffleball puck thing, shuffleboard, hits the pins right  when the shit hits the water.  Your own sound effects?  And then the people go, they applaud in the game, and I'm like, thank you, thank you.  You ever hold a shit, and you're going to hold it, and then that whole, like, that  weird euphoria, watch it over, you're like, I gotta hold it.  Like, I'm holding it now, it's a little bit uncomfortable, I gotta be like... 
[01:27:30]  That happened to me once when I was driving, and I had to take my foot off of the gas  and just coast until it was over.  Dude, I had to pull over in L.A. once.  I had lunch with Whitney Cummings, and I had a fucking Cobb salad and three coffees, and  I'm driving home, and I'm like, alright, the reality is, you're in traffic, you're going  to shit your pants. 
[01:28:00]  How do you spin this?  I made it back to my garage in Los Feliz, and I pull into the thing, and I had to sit  in the car, because I'm sitting there, and I'm like, alright, maybe you can get it  and I opened my car door, and I swung my feet out, and I literally couldn't, if I bent  my stomach, I was just going to shit down the back of my leg, so I had to wait to get out  of my car.  It was the worst fucking pain I've ever felt in my stomach. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, is that funny?  And we've talked about this before, too, your body just knows when the toilet is near.  Dude.  Like, you could drive an hour and just be going, God, I gotta really go, I gotta go,  I gotta go.  And the second you pull onto your street, it's like, I'm coming out now!  It knows.  I actually will convince myself.  Do you know, I will convince myself, like, that day when I finally made it up to my apartment,  if I could, I undid my pants, and I couldn't bend to, if I bent, I was going to shit onto 
[01:29:00]  my belt and pants, I had to fucking divert myself, I was like, is that a roach?  And then my mind went, ha, and I went, ha, ha, and I dropped my pants and sat.  You fooled your ass.  I really did, I fucking, I went, what's that?  And when my fucking, my colon looked, I sat down.  I'll lie to myself, and I'm stiff-legging down my fucking hallway.  Stiff, stiff.  Dude, there's nothing worse than when you make it up, you make it up the elevator, and you 
[01:29:30]  got a fucking, you got a fucking, you got a stiff leg down, and I see my door, and  I'm like, I'm going to shit before I get in that apartment.  You get so excited.  Yeah, because my, it's like your body, it does know.  It just knows it's close.  And the shit goes, you know, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon  me.  For a while it's hanging in there, and then it's like, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon  me, excuse me, pardon me.  And then I'll actually tell myself, all right, I'm going to make a couple phone calls, go on  the computer.  I'll tell myself I have other things to do to make my shit think there's still five 
[01:30:00]  more minutes.  You're not that important.  You're not that important.  And it works.  Yeah, and then, ah, I'm on the ball.  Yeah.  It's a good one.  A couple things, Ann, when you casually said that it was 12,000 feet of toilet paper for  what, $9?  Yeah.  People obviously did the math, and we should have.  Two and a half miles of toilet paper.  That's two and a half miles of crappy toilet paper.  Yes.  And Dennis D. from Jersey, Sheryl Crow must be shitting squirrel pellets if she can only  use one square of TP. 
[01:30:30]  Chris, you good?  No, I have one last thing.  I'm sorry, guys.  Okay, go ahead.  Did you talk about your car troubles from Rhode Island or something like that?  Yeah, is that all settled?  No, it's not done yet.  I got a call yesterday from the gentleman, and they said that they were putting it up  on the machine and going through all kind of diagnostic to check out what it was, because  it's some kind of an electrical problem. 
[01:31:00]  The check charging system light came on, and then the juice came out of the battery, and  that was it.  You know, the car just conks out.  And I figured while I'm having it up there, I'm having the high-performance rear brake calipers  put in.  So, fuck it.  My father-in-law was almost going to pick you up.  He's a tow guy, and he got a call.  You called somebody, and he got a call, and they were waiting for you to call back, and  they said your people, quote-unquote, said you were probably sleeping.  They couldn't get in touch with you. 
[01:31:30]  My people?  I didn't have people.  That's what I was told.  One guy called and said, well, they can't get in touch with him.  They said he's probably sleeping.  I used Coletta towing.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it wasn't.  I don't know.  They must have got another guy.  But I was hoping you were all right.  So, good luck to you.  Yeah.  You guys missed the obvious joke.  What's that, Chip?  He's a tow guy.  He's going to pick up my toes, but it's going to get the rest of my body.  All right, guys. 
[01:32:00]  Have a great day, man.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, Chris.  He just goes, all right, guys.  Have a great day.  At least I know I'm not the only one.  Thank you, Chris.  Didn't even acknowledge Chip.  Oh, didn't even acknowledge Chip said anything.  Yeah, guy's going to be laughing all the way almost.  Probably steal that one from himself.  Did Sean Hannity enjoy your Chip impression?  I didn't, but I did do an Emporium reference on Red Eye.  Oh, I like that.  I like the Emporium.  Speaking of Red Eye, we're going to play that clip after the break.  Yeah.  And get into this Times Square bomber thing. 
[01:32:30]  It's a nerve of me to listen to this show for my news.  How stupid am I?  Did he get spanked?  No, but I realized I was wrong.  Yeah.  I said it on the air, and I already apologized on Twitter.  All right, we'll explain next.  I'm not going to apologize, though.  I think our info was accurate.  No, we were wrong.  I don't know.  We were wrong.  We might have to take a hit on this one, Hope.  We were wrong.  How wrong.  I'm giving a percentage of we were 85% to 90% wrong.  Really? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  We're cunts.  There's a 10%...  Yeah, yeah.  We'll explain next.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call 866-1211.  I want to give a big fuck you to the guy who answers the call.  He keeps fucking hanging up on me, and I don't want to say no reason why.  That's 866-969-1969.  I just want to say fuck you to whoever's answering the phones at ONA.  Every time I fucking call in, I get thank you and hung up on, you little piece of shit. 
[01:33:30]  Smartphone users, send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  I'd like to give a big F to you out to your phone screener who thinks everything I have to say isn't funny or relevant.  Fuck you.  And now, this is the Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  London calling. 
[01:34:00]  What do you think of that, Ant?  Who is that?  Well, I'm trying to keep Whip'em Out Wednesday going, at least on the Twitter.  Jesus.  And that one just came in, huh?  Turn the monitor is a little askew, so I'm not getting the full resolution of the picture.  Go on the big screen.  Yeah, Danny, you popped that up on the big screen.  Yeah, you bitch.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  I'm trying to keep Whip'em Out Wednesday going, because it's tough to do it in the morning out there in Radioland. 
[01:34:30]  Holy mother of fuck.  They're at least keeping it going on Twitter for all of us.  And you could go to Opie Radio on Twitter to see the picture that Anthony is just fucking looking at.  Is that nice?  Her tits are too big, though.  I like her legs are nice.  She has great legs.  Why do you have to spoil it for everyone, Jamie?  Everything looks good.  Let's just say.  They're not real.  I am not the giant titty-liking guy, but let me tell you something.  But as far as giant titty goes, that's pretty fucking fine.  The rest of her body's really good, and she's got that innocent face where the tits almost don't fit. 
[01:35:00]  And I don't know if that's implants, man.  That just might be youth on her side.  No, they gotta be.  Go back to that picture, Ant.  Look at her tiny head.  Is it youth, or is that a really good...  Those are implants.  Those gotta be implants.  But you can't tell.  They're massive.  What do you think?  The thought of those being natural would prove that there is a god.  Well, look at her butt.  That's proof of a god.  Her butt's proportionate to the big boobies.  She does have a juicy fucking rump. 
[01:35:30]  I'd suck her tits, but I mean, I just...  Would ya?  Those are for titty fucking...  But I don't like fake tits.  I really don't.  Of course you would suck them.  You're not a Muslim.  Fake tits, but that's true.  I might convert, though.  Yeah?  Fake tits bug me.  Well, yeah.  Do you have breast cancer or something?  Like, I get it.  Why, you know...  I'd throw rocks at her.  No, for the most part...  I'd be like a Muslim and throw rocks at her for turning me on.  For the most part, fake boobs sucks.  There was one girl.  She was from...  Where was she from, man?  NEW days.  I think she was from Oregon. 
[01:36:00]  She was a stripper that came to New York.  And then, remember, she came in just to say goodbye to us.  She was sad.  She did a few things for us.  And she had implants, but they were under the muscle, and you just couldn't tell.  It was probably one of the...  Probably, no.  The best ones we ever saw.  Most of them were just horrible as soon as they took off their sweaters and shit.  Girls gotta spend a lot of money on implants.  They gotta be put in properly.  You can't go from an A to a D.  You know, you have to have pretty good tits to start out with.  My favorite? 
[01:36:30]  The small girl that does just that.  Goes A to maybe a full C, D.  Yeah.  But small frame.  Had nothing to begin with.  And then they take their shirt off.  We've seen it all at NEW especially.  And it looks like two fucking tight softballs on her chest.  Yeah.  Just horrible.  That doesn't work.  Horrendous.  You can't.  You just can't do that.  What doctor would say, yeah, this is gonna look good for you?  One that wants money.  True.  I hear E-Rock isn't talking to anyone today.  Why?  I know we want to talk about the Times Square bomber, and we might have an apology or two, 
[01:37:00]  and we do have some audio from Red Eye last night with Jim Norton, and Anthony's doing  Sean Hannity tonight.  Let's not forget.  Yeah.  But E-Rock's not talking to anyone.  He's walking around here with his headphones on.  He is fucking livid about what happened yesterday on the show.  Yeah.  He's a little...  Now, Dr. Ian Smith was talking to, what, Shade 45 yesterday, and he goes, hey, I want  to say hi to my old pals, Opie and Anthony.  And he came in here.  He gave us a great segment, didn't he?  Yeah.  It was nice. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  And then some old business came up where we reminded Ian...  Have one of those, Kenny.  That just smells too fucking good.  The whole room smells like fucking popcorn.  No, no, no.  I'll wait.  Dude, take one, because I can't eat these live.  No, I'll wait.  Take one.  You eat one, I eat one, and then he comes back with one more for each of us.  I want two.  I want my own.  Here, share.  No, I don't share.  I want you to share.  Share.  Nobody touched it.  It's a sign of friendship when you fucking share food.  My food's my food.  I haven't touched it, though.  My food's my food.  Opie's little thumb didn't touch it. 
[01:38:00]  Share.  I don't care.  Proof to everyone, we're still friends.  We share food.  We are, but I don't share food with anybody.  Share.  I don't share food with anybody.  Smell it.  No.  Smell it.  It smells really good.  I don't share.  Opie didn't touch it?  He didn't touch it with his toe thumb?  You're going to make me...  Stop.  His toe thumb.  Hey.  No, I don't.  Wait, you notice that, too?  I don't share food.  From across the street.  The second somebody's food is placed in front of them, I can't touch it.  No one touched it, though.  No one touched that.  You're going to make me feel bad.  It's not you.  Come on.  You're going to make me feel bad. 
[01:38:30]  I said it.  It's not about you.  Once somebody's food is placed down there...  Smell that.  Smell that.  I will have mine coming in soon.  I'd love a bite of that.  See, we're not friends.  I knew it.  That smells good.  No, it has nothing to do with friends.  I wouldn't do it with anybody.  I just knew.  I wouldn't do it with anybody.  I just knew.  See?  I don't.  See, this was a test that we set up ahead of time.  I knew.  It was not.  I knew.  God, that smells good.  You share food with friends.  It's just delicious smelling.  No, no, I can't.  If food is put down in front of someone, I then cannot eat it.  I'd love a bite of one of those. 
[01:39:00]  It's theirs, and it's been in their space.  I've got a bite.  And that's with anybody.  Jimmy, you want one of my pop-tarts?  Not a whole tart.  A little bite.  Your toe thumb.  You really noticed this?  What?  Your toe thumb.  How could you not?  I thought you were doing a fucking...  Yes, I was like, you must be doing a handstand.  Oh, it's...  Oh, no.  You notice my birth defect?  I have the worst birth defect.  Yes, sometimes I want to call it the Megan Fox and Anthony show.  For the people that don't know, I have Megan Fox thumbs.  They made a big deal about Megan Fox's thumbs, and I went, hey, that's my thumb. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, there's a few of us in the family that have this.  Oh, yeah.  Have you noticed I only eat wrapped things that come in here, too?  No.  Like, I do.  I don't eat anything that...  I am.  I'm very weird.  Got a little teeny corner.  Is that Megan Fox's thumb?  Yeah, me and her.  Look, it's the same fucking thing.  What's wrong with her thumb?  Do you know that...  You shut up!  There's nothing wrong with it.  Why didn't she grow her nail a little longer?  If you were fucking her, that would eventually start to annoy you.  Would it? 
[01:40:00]  Because she's gorgeous, but it would bother you.  Yeah.  Are both her hands like that, or is it just one?  My left one's worse than my right one.  Wow.  But they're both bad.  Yeah.  You'd be like, oh, you'd start fucking her, and then she'd touch your face, and you'd look  over at that old lady toe, and you'd want to just go...  Old lady toe!  Get off my fucking face with that.  I wonder what happened.  People want me to tweet my thumbs.  That nail is very...  I don't want to.  It looks like a big toe.  It does.  Her thumb is horrible. 
[01:40:30]  Actually, hers is worse than mine.  Know what's the worst part about my thumbs?  I can't bowl.  You can't bowl?  Well, look.  They don't even look that thick, but they are.  I think they're thick this way.  I'm pointing like...  So you got like a giant thumb hole in the bowling ball?  I can't find a fucking bowling ball that I could fit this stupid thumb in.  You're the guy walking around the bowling alley going, no.  No.  No.  They're short, stubby, and they're thick from nail to back, if that makes sense.  Like, they're not thick this way. 
[01:41:00]  Like a toe.  Like a toe.  Okay, yeah.  So I can't fucking bowl.  I'm finally admitting that.  When you bowl, it probably goes like this.  And the bowl just goes up straight.  Go ahead, right ahead.  Sir, you just chat.  Hello?  They're testing the phone?  Hello?  Okay.  At least say hi.  It's Mars.  And Sam.  What are you doing?  And Sam.  And Sam.  I guess they're testing the phone.  All right, well.  Sounds good.  And then if I...  It sounds good.  And if I get a bowling ball that has a big enough hole to get this stupid thumb in, then 
[01:41:30]  it's too fucking heavy.  Then it's a heavy one, yeah.  Those are made for the big bruises.  Cannonball.  Yeah.  Anyway, where were we?  Oh, do you want me to break off a little piece of that corner?  Oh, here.  A teeny piece.  Here.  Jimmy wants some.  Jimmy will.  Jimmy.  Jimmy will share food with me.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Well, Jimmy will.  Well, just take a piece.  I'm not like that.  No, I can't.  I can't.  Wow.  I'm not like that.  That's fucking...  That'd be funny if Obie threw it out.  That's because Jimmy touched. 
[01:42:00]  And you don't need frosting on fucking brown sugar Pop-Tarts.  You just don't need it.  I love frosting.  You don't need it, though.  How good is that?  I like extra frosting.  When I was a boy, Mother would give me extra frosting.  Mother.  Would you lick the beaters when she would bake something?  For my father's fists?  God damn, Jimmy.  So where's Sam?  Because Z-Rock...  Oh, here come your Pop-Tarts, Sam.  Oh, yay. 
[01:42:30]  Don't bring them close to me.  I'll smash them from your face now.  I know.  Everyone's going to smash them now.  Don't smash them.  One time I had Pop-Tarts.  I said, why don't you bring me some Mom-Tarts, too?  Oh, Chip.  They're not called that for paternal reasons.  Because they pop out of the toaster.  I didn't say they had nothing to do with the nighttime.  No, no, no.  Not nocturnal.  Thank you.  No, no.  There's too many pretzels, Kenny.  Just two.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Pretzels.  Why would you go from Pop-Tarts to dry pretzels?  Anything would have to pay. 
[01:43:00]  Here's my penis.  Yum.  Pretty good.  Oh, Carolina man.  Oh, same thing here.  I've been palming eight-pound bowling balls for years.  I never find one that works.  I like bowling, too.  I just can't.  You know how many times I fucking throw the ball and you hear it pop?  It makes that sound.  It pops as the thumb finally releases from the ball. 
[01:43:30]  And then it goes straight up in the air and just falls like two feet in front of you.  Horrible.  Horrible.  You're the suction-popping bowling ball guy in the bowling alley.  Oh, Sam, so as we enjoy Pop-Tarts and pretzels, coffee.  Friendship.  You deserve it.  You drink ginger ale when you're not sick?  It's, um, Schweppes diet ginger ale.  I have, I've not been drinking much soda ever since Colin said that he read.  Ginger ale sucks unless you're sick, though.  Colin said he read that certain sodas cause pancreatic cancer. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, my God.  So I'm avoiding soda now.  I drink a lot of unsweetened iced tea, but occasionally I treat myself.  After I jerk off twice last night, the second time I came, literally my dick just went,  all right.  And fucking gave me one drop to shut me up.  That was it, huh?  It was awful.  It was awful.  It was like squeezing a leaf.  And what does Colin know about the, like...  He reads a lot.  He's a fucking older man with his fucking horrible skinny arms.  Soda?  What kind of soda?  He said Diet Coke, but again, might be bullshit. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Blue Heeler.  The best thing ever.  Ready for this?  Put butter on a brown sugar Pop-Tart and then throw them in a toaster oven.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't sound very healthy.  Not like a Pop-Tart is.  Well, when you eat a Pop-Tart, you're not thinking help.  Oh, we can cheat a little bit.  What are you going to do?  Are we on the radio?  Yeah.  Oh, E-Rock.  Yes.  He's angry.  I got the setup, though, so... 
[01:45:00]  Ian comes in yesterday.  We have a great set.  He's called Happy or something?  Happy.  Okay.  You should check it out.  E-Rock should check it out.  Oh, why?  He's not happy?  No, he's not.  He's been reading miserable.  We decided to bring up some old business with Ian Smith where Ian gave E-Rock $500, and if  he didn't lose the weight within 30 days or something like that, he had to give the money  back.  But Ian never did our show again until yesterday.  A couple years went by.  So, of course, we have to remind Ian about that.  And he goes, fuck, I want my $500 back. 
[01:45:30]  To make a long story short, E-Rock went down to an ATM after a long time of being told to  do so, gave the money to Ian, and then we suggested that maybe he should give the money  to Sam, and then Ian came up with a brilliant, brilliant little thing.  Oh, yeah.  He gave the $500 to Sam and had Sam decide if he was going to give it back to E-Rock,  and, of course, Sam, God bless him, said, fuck that.  E-Rock needs to be taught a lesson and decided to keep E-Rock's $500. 
[01:46:00]  Is that pretty much how it went down?  I said that the lesson that E-Rock would get losing the $500, E-Rock, right body, I said  that the lesson he would get when he realized that he has to live up to his word was more  valuable than the $500.  Of course it is.  And here's what I was thinking, too.  If Dr. Ian Smith really wanted to give him back the $500, he just would have given it  to him.  Yeah.  But he gave it to you, which means inside he didn't want E-Rock to have that back. 
[01:46:30]  He didn't want to be the bad guy, but he also did not want E-Rock to have the money.  So he gave it to you.  You didn't want to enable E-Rock.  Right.  So you felt this was a time for him to take some tough medicine.  So, yeah, personal responsibility to say, okay, you know what?  I lost that one.  Let's move on from it.  But E-Rock thought it was just some kind of on-air routine, just some kind of bit.  Nope.  Because after they got off the air, he was talking to Dr. Ian, and Dr. Ian, I guess, said,  hey, make sure you get that money back from Sam, at which point Eric said, Sam, Dr. Ian 
[01:47:00]  Smith said that you have to give me the money back.  And I let E-Rock know that unfortunately for him, Dr. Ian Smith has literally no authority  over any financial decisions I make.  And that him saying that to E-Rock really doesn't mean a whole lot.  How bummed do you think E-Rock was to just see him in the halls, even before he came  in here, just look at, like when you were, when I was younger, I would owe somebody money 
[01:47:30]  and I'd see him and be like, oh no, Louie Beans.  Louie Beans.  Yeah, you know, it's 20 bucks.  Then E-Rock.  He's out of your life.  You're right, John.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  You read, John.  There's just a natural reaction from Voss, the idea of reading.  Then E-Rock insisted that he was leaving at 11 a.m. yesterday.  He was leaving early and he needed the money back.  He said, I demand that I need the $500 back. 
[01:48:00]  I'm leaving at 11.  Demand?  I need it to pay bills.  And I said, I mean, I don't know why you think demands are going to get you anywhere here.  And if he needed it to pay bills, why was he paying back Dr. Ian with him?  Right.  I said, you probably would have been able to figure out a way to pay your bills if Dr. Ian  had taken it.  And he said, no.  And then we came into the studio to clean it up and he physically put his hands on me  and shoved me.  We should get E-Rock in here.  He hasn't talked to anyone today.  No. 
[01:48:30]  I'm distracted because Mark B. in Connecticut is calling me light bulb thumbs.  Dude, your thumbs are not that bad Tweety Bird heads.  How about, uh...  Where's E-Rock?  Let's get E-Rock in.  And then J.D. in New York City as, uh, E-Rock makes his way down the hall.  There he's here.  Take your toe thumbs and your T-Rex arms to the pro shop at the bowling alley.  Buy your own bowling ball and have them drill out the holes to fit your monstrous thumbs.  Monstrous thumbs?  I don't bowl enough to get my own stupid bowling ball.  I don't care how much money you have. 
[01:49:00]  Obie's thumbs are like the first step of making a balloon animal.  That first twist.  Dude, would you ever get your own bowling ball?  Well, no.  I always thought those guys were, like, were losers when they went to the bowling alley  with their own foot.  He's not rolling his thumbs.  Who cares if they look like Dudley Moore's foot?  I'm hiding them now.  I'm sorry.  E-Rock.  E-Rock!  Welcome to the program.  Thank you.  You see, look at his face.  He's so unhappy. 
[01:49:30]  Are you mad?  Walk us through this.  What happened?  What's up?  What's up?  What happened?  Walk us through, like, what happened yesterday.  Yeah.  Then after the show ended and all that.  Well, we just got Sam's part of the story.  Yeah, we'd like your half.  All right.  Well, you pretty much know most of it where, you know, that asshole's demanding his money  back after three years.  So I go, okay.  Well, he's not an asshole.  No, he's not an asshole.  That was his money.  Dr. Ian Smith?  Yeah, he's an asshole. 
[01:50:00]  That was his money.  Why would you say he's an asshole?  You welched on the bed.  He's got seven books.  So he's not an asshole.  And he's happy.  What?  Dr. Ian Smith has seven books and he's happy.  I wouldn't call him an asshole.  E-Rock said wince on the bed yesterday, too.  Yes, yes.  Don't wince on the bed.  E-Rock says the books aren't selling well.  Why?  You did some research?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why he's doing seven, because the first six, well, actually, the first two or three  did okay, because he had the TV show.  What was the New York Times' number one bestseller, though?  Probably when he was doing the TV show. 
[01:50:30]  After that, they tanked.  I mean, number one is good.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  So that asshole, our friend, Dr. Ian Smith.  Who, by the way, so after that bet, when I was supposed to give him the money, he threw  a temper tantrum having to sit in our office at K-Rock because we didn't just walk him  into the studio while you guys were doing something.  Threw a fit, and then he left, and then we never heard from him again.  For two years.  Yeah.  Three years.  Three years.  It's been three years?  2007.  Wow.  And that was the day he was going to collect his money, and we never put him on the air? 
[01:51:00]  That was everything.  We had the envelope and everything.  So you had the envelope full of money.  You were going to give Ian Smith his money back.  Yeah.  We were going to do this whole ceremony thing on the air.  And we tried to give it back.  How long did that money remain in that envelope?  For another four or five months.  You had $500 in an envelope for five months?  Yeah.  You're crazy.  I cannot believe that.  No, it was because it was used towards something else, so it was being saved. 
[01:51:30]  What was it used towards?  None of your fucking business.  See what I mean?  Very upset over nothing I did.  You.  You're a little new today.  Sam is basically saying that you're getting your comeuppance.  Yeah, because I need to get comeuppance from Sam.  Fair is fair.  Fair is fair.  All right, so bring us to yesterday.  So, you know, he wants his money, and he's throwing his little tantrum.  So I go, okay, I'll go get the money because, yes, I did owe it to him. 
[01:52:00]  And you didn't want to, you know.  And it wasn't your money.  I didn't want to wince on the bed.  No, so I went and got the money.  It was going to be good for on air.  Whatever.  Actually, I didn't use that.  Whatever.  So I went and got the money, came back.  We did the whole bit here, and, you know, he's going to give it to Sam to show me.  So he showed me.  He said, I thought it would be good for on air, and we would do the whole bit, meaning that  this whole thing was just a farce that we scripted for the O&A show. 
[01:52:30]  Because after three years, his statute of limitations on that is he doesn't own the fucking  money anymore.  When was the last time we just did a bit?  Most of our stuff, I'd say well over 90% of our stuff is as real as it gets.  Yeah.  The fake stuff is, you know, the bra bombing.  All right.  Please.  That was fake.  They almost forgot.  You sounded so organic.  What do you got out there?  Will you shut up?  Hey, we're about to do this.  All right.  Hey, yeah.  I'm browsing away.  Good boo.  Yuck. 
[01:53:00]  Well, this just came in.  Maybe Opie's drain plug thumbs could be of use to stop the oil leak in the Gulf.  James in Indiana.  My thumbs are taken out.  Beating.  Sure.  All right, Iraq.  Continue.  Sorry.  So I give him the money.  He does what he does.  He gives it to Sam.  We go to break.  I'm outside with Steve.  Dr. Ian comes out.  He's talking about something.  And he turns to me.  He goes, make sure, you know, you get that money back from Sam. 
[01:53:30]  I'm like, he's not going to give that back.  Sam, did you hear Dr. Ian say this?  No, no, I did not hear him.  So this could just be an Iraq fabrication.  Steve did, though.  Steve was there.  Yes, he said it.  And it was confirmed by a caller from Australia.  Corey.  Corey, thank you.  I seem to have forgotten his name.  Anthony, Ope, do you get annoyed when your thumbs get stuck in those plastic rings that  hold a six-pack?  Oh, that'll happen. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  There's a couple things going on.  Go ahead, Iraq.  At least you only have two thumbs.  So I say he won't give it back.  He says, well, you should go talk to him.  I said, no, you should go talk to him.  And that's when Dr. Ian said, oh, he looked at his watch, said, I'm late for Rachel Ray and  had to leave.  He was.  And to Ian's credit, he could have talked to me all he wanted.  Dr. Ian Smith is not going to tell me what to do with my money.  And it was at that point.  And it is your money.  You really feel like it's your money as soon as it was given to me.  See, Iraq, I'm thinking if Dr. Ian Smith really wanted you to have the money, he would have 
[01:54:30]  given it to you.  So instead of saying, make sure you get the money from Sam, it's like, why?  Why wouldn't he have just given it to you?  He's just trying to be the nice guy.  No, he's just being an asshole.  That's his quote unquote character that he does.  He's on TV being a nice guy.  He's no character.  See, Dr. Ian Smith, he does characters.  Like Mr. Imus.  Yeah.  So what happened after the show yesterday?  I mean, more like there were demands made. 
[01:55:00]  Let's go, Iraq.  Tell your whole side.  So I was I was talking with Sam and I said, look, I have to get out of here at 11 o'clock.  I want that money back.  Oh, shit.  Assuming that the radio bit was over.  Right.  And it's time now to give my demand.  The first answer from Sam was, we'll see.  The second answer.  See, that that is such a thing.  Like that, that dad says to you behaves himself.  We'll see. 
[01:55:30]  Can we go to the we'll see, which means no, by the way, always means no.  It just means I don't want to hear your shit.  And what I guess you were assuming after the show that Sam's going to play with you a little  while for a couple more hours, make you sweat a little.  It could have been a couple more hours because he went home so early.  Oh, no, because you had to go home at 11.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice little jab there.  No, because the show's over at 1030.  You had to go home at 11.  It couldn't have been more than a half hour.  I'm just saying.  Just to get the time frame. 
[01:56:00]  So we're all, you know, on the same page, as they say.  Yeah.  So you were out at 11.  Yes, I was.  And he says it like, yes, I was.  All right.  All right.  And you demanded the money back before you left at 11.  A second time, yes.  Uh-huh.  And Sam goes, yes, because demands will make you get that money back fast or something along  those lines.  Oh, shit.  And then tell them about you physically putting your hands on me.  Okay.  Did you assault him?  That was when the show was done. 
[01:56:30]  We all came in here to wrap up, to clean up, whatever.  And I did.  Did you touch Sam or use foul language against him in any way?  Foul language, no.  Touch him, yes.  You're fired.  Yes.  Wow, you just fired him?  That's my fast time.  Oh, great.  Go home at nine-something today.  That's awesome.  Brad, who's being an asshole and wouldn't give me my money.  So, yeah, I walked in, and then there's Sam, you know, giving his look and making his  little laugh. 
[01:57:00]  I was talking to Patrice, and he's a comedian.  He made me laugh.  Lying, because Patrice is pointing at me, just, you know, giving me that look that, you  know, you got fucked.  The joke was at your expense.  Yeah.  And then Sam's doing his little, you know, evil cackle.  Yes.  So I reach back as I'm walking over to where Jimmy's area is, and I did apologize for this  afterward, because I meant to just push him, but I leaned back and I grabbed his face and  shoved him back into the couch.  You mushed him?  You gave him a mush?  No, it was more like a heave. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Are you going to HR with that, Sam?  Well, the best part about the whole thing, I would, if I was you.  The best part about it was I looked at him.  He won't admit this, but immediately after he did it, I made eye contact with him, and  he had the look in his eyes like he knew he had just made a big mistake, because I still  had the $500.  And if demanding didn't work, bullying certainly wouldn't either.  Right, right, right.  Bullying isn't going to work.  No.  Not for me.  Never works.  He realized he made a tactical error.  Yes. 
[01:58:00]  No, that was just in response to the Patrice pointing and him just doing his laugh.  I reached over and pushed him.  Now, is it true you're not talking to anyone today?  You're livid still?  No, actually, I've been talking to everybody.  No.  I just haven't talked to certain people out of the office.  Now, you feel this isn't fair that you, in essence, pretty much eliminating the middleman  here, you pretty much went to an ATM yesterday, took out $500, and handed it over to Sam.  No, I didn't hand it to Sam. 
[01:58:30]  Well, no, I mean-  Take out the middleman.  Take out the middleman, because this is the end.  Sam wasn't in the-  Forget about the whole-  Forget about everything.  No, this is why I'm saying you're angry, is because you should feel like what you did  was went to the ATM, took out $500, and handed it to Sam for no reason.  Correct.  That's pretty much how it ended up.  So, taking out all the Dr. Ian Smith stuff, and this, and the bet, and everything, you pretty  much just handed Sam $500.  Why'd you do that?  I didn't do that. 
[01:59:00]  And then he got upset, because I posted something on my Twitter saying, I was happy with the  decision I had made.  Which, by the way, was one of the funniest tweets I've read in a while.  This motherfucker.  What was the exact fucking wording?  It was, I'm happy with my decision.  So, and I tagged him, so happy with my decision to keep at E-Rock Radio's $500.  Yes.  Oh, so-  And then I got a text within five minutes, saying, are you seriously keeping that? 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  And I go-  From at E-Rock.  Right.  And I go, yeah.  I mean, it was given to me.  It's done.  I already told you.  Are you already spending some of it?  Well, yeah.  And then he got really pissed off, because I told him I bought Troy some concert tickets  he was looking for.  Also, people do want to wish you a happy Cinco de Mayo.  The Cinco de Mayo.  E-Rock.  Could you respond to the happy Cinco de Mayo?  I'm not listening to you. 
[02:00:00]  I'm reading what Danny wrote there.  You should listen to Anthony.  He's your boss.  Anthony.  Oh, shit.  I am?  Well, yes.  All right.  Cool.  Your name's on the wall.  I didn't think I was a boss.  My name's on the wall in bathrooms, too.  Doesn't make me the boss.  What'd you call Dr. Ian Smith if we got?  Oh, shit.  He's an asshole.  Oh.  Oh.  I thought it was something else.  Holy Jesus.  Hello, Mr. Asshole.  Oh, thanks, guys.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  Don't blame me, because you know me and you are friends. 
[02:00:30]  We're tight, but E-Rock is calling you an asshole today.  He is not happy with how everything went down yesterday.  Well, it's interesting.  He says that behind my back.  You know, I'm in Philadelphia right now, of course, and he knew I was leaving, so instead  of saying while I was in still, he does a while I'm away.  Okay, I got you.  Good point.  I'll be back on the 13th.  I'll be back on the 13th.  Oh, that's amazing.  Wow.  E-Rock just threw his hands up in the air like, ooh, you're scaring me.  Just want to let you know that.  You know what?  Not only will I be back on the 13th, but get your video cameras out so you can stream 
[02:01:00]  it live on the website.  E-Rock, we are going to town.  Should I be a nice guy?  Should I be the nice Dr. Ian?  Well, why don't you play your character on Celebrity Fit Club?  Oh, E-Rock.  That's because you lost a bet and had to pay the guy off.  It doesn't mean he's the asshole.  E-Rock didn't have to pay the guy off.  He just had to return the $500.  This is not E-Rock's money.  Right, right.  This isn't even your money, you're right.  It's my money.  After three years, it's my fucking money.  You basically did just collect interest on $500. 
[02:01:30]  Yes.  I love how E-Rock came to work yesterday, minding his own business.  He's out $500, and now Dr. Ian Smith's going to beat the shit.  All because he's a sourpuss.  And believe me, E-Rock, believe me, E-Rock, when I come to the studio, I don't get dirty,  but I will bring some boys with me.  You can't do it yourself.  Oh!  You know something, I think he could.  No, he can't.  He probably could.  Wouldn't it be ironic if he beat you with his happy book? 
[02:02:00]  What irony.  Chris S. and Shirley's dragging me into this.  What E-Rock is failing to realize is that Opie instigated the whole situation by telling  Dr. Ian Smith that he would start massive shit if he gave the money to Sam.  Is that what?  E-Rock can't be mad at one of his MySpace heroes.  Oh, of course.  No, E-Rock didn't hear that because he was down at the ATM getting the money.  Well, E-Rock, it's safe to say you know me.  I would not do that to you.  Right.  So what we got here is E-Rock didn't even, it's not even E-Rock's money. 
[02:02:30]  It's not.  It was Dr. Ian Smith's money.  It was at one point.  But you were holding it.  Well, yeah, you gave it to him like it was still his money.  That's where you're at fault.  Because I'll honor my bet on that.  He's trying to say that after three years that you didn't deserve the $500 back.  He just said he would honor his bet.  Why not honor the fact that Dr. Ian Smith decided to give a gift to somebody that is his new friend?  And he can do anything he wants with his own money.  It's his money.  So why are you mad at Sam at all? 
[02:03:00]  I'm in good shape and Dr. Ian Smith wanted to reward that.  You got it.  There you go.  There you go.  Hey, I tell you what, guys.  I tell you what.  E-Rock, here's the deal, baby.  Here's the deal.  Yeah.  We can do a two-week competition if you want to do it.  Two-week competition.  Two weeks.  Involving what?  Ten pounds in two weeks.  You follow my new book called The Four-Day Diet.  Ten pounds in two weeks, you get the $500 back.  Okay, bring it.  Let's do it. 
[02:03:30]  We go with that.  Now, guys, listen.  Since you know I'm not there, you've got to weigh him in.  Be for real.  But it's ten pounds in two weeks.  And I'll make sure you get the copy of the book today.  All right, that sounds fair.  This guy's going above and beyond the Call of Duty here.  He really is.  Not the same $500.  Dr. Ian Smith, that same $500 is gone.  That's gone?  That same $500 is gone.  Because we're going to get to the fact that Sam has already started spending his money.  He's spending like a madman.  Wait, how is Ian Smith, who won a bet, going to be out $500? 
[02:04:00]  He's got to lose ten pounds.  He ain't going to be out shit.  That's true.  He really is.  Only on your show, guys.  Don't worry.  I've got another $500.  E-Rock, this is for you and your girl, man.  If you lose ten pounds because you look terrible.  If you lose ten pounds.  If you lose ten pounds and some of the men's boobs you got.  Oh, boobies.  E-Rock, did you hear that?  Your headphones weren't on.  I heard it.  Okay.  It's not good, E-Rock.  It wasn't good.  We've got the scale in front of us, Dr. Ian Smith. 
[02:04:30]  We can do the weigh-in while you're on the phone in Philly.  Yeah, get away right now.  What does he got?  Driver, pull the truck forward on the scales.  Driver, pull the front axle on the scales.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Morning Dew Farhead brought in the...  Morning Dew Farhead.  And when he's bending over like that, his whole ass is hanging out.  Charlie's a disaster.  Charlie. 
[02:05:00]  He's drowning in his own sweat.  Tripping on the court on the way out on the court for the scale.  With his meaty calves.  He's in a wreck.  So, are we going to...  Are we weighing E-Rock?  E-Rock, are you in on this bed or not?  Sure, why not?  All right.  Not the enthusiasm he used to have.  $500 ago.  So, E-Rock.  All right.  Pull up on the scale. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  E-Rock's going on the scale.  See, that doesn't help.  That's not helping.  That makes him sound fatter.  What was the original weight of E-Rock?  214 when this whole thing went down?  And you wanted him to lose from 214 three years ago.  So...  Yep.  All right.  So, let's see what E-Rock weighs today.  Oh, it's more than 214.  He should be in his underpants.  Otherwise, the 10 pounds thing. 
[02:06:00]  I agree.  I actually agree with that.  Yeah, fuck you.  I'm not doing that.  Sorry.  No, you should be.  Well, I mean, you get that...  I don't give a shit.  I'm not doing it.  If money's on the line...  How about just what you're...  You keep the shirt on, but then...  You actually should get an accurate weight, dude.  The shirt...  Keep the t-shirt on so when you weigh in next time, you can at least wear the t-shirt and socks  and underwear.  But you can't have on jeans and your sneakers.  It's silly for a weigh-in.  That's true.  You're not flirting with me.  I'm not.  Keep the shirt on.  What's a proper weigh-in, Dr. Ian Smith?  Well, he should be...  I mean, I don't want to do this to you guys in the studio, but the guy should be in his  underwear, but I really don't want to do that to you guys. 
[02:06:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So, we'll take a few pounds because of the clothes.  We'll just give a two-pound credit for the clothes.  Or we just re-weigh him with relatively the same clothes on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  We can do that.  I mean, shoes and pants have to come off.  Are you doing shoes and pants, Z-Rock?  Who farted?  That was Danny Ross.  That was a real bad one.  Danny, holy shit.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, Danny's farts are fucking horrendous.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  He always had that when he was a boy.  You might want to talk to Danny about his diet, Dr. Ian Smith.  Yes.  Wow.  He eats farts.  All right, Z-Rock's...  We got to close the fucking curtains because Z-Rock's taking his jeans off.  What's wrong with this place?  E-Rock requested it.  Oh, you did, E-Rock?  I'm glad I'm not there.  Modest.  Yes, he did.  All right, his shoes and his jeans are off.  He's getting on the scale.  Jesus.  There's fucking calves on this, kid.  He's got nice calves, right?  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  All right, you're stepping on the scale.  Oh, no.  Throw it to scale.  Yeah, that's what we're getting at, Sam.  Very good.  Very good, Sam.  What was the weight?  2.27.  Oh, 2.27.  What was it?  Wait, what?  Three years ago when you thought he was fat or needed to lose weight at 214, now he's 
[02:08:00]  227 there, Dr. Ian Smith.  Yeah.  And he's had a trainer since, I think, Christmas.  Yeah.  Yes.  That was five months ago.  What the fuck is the trainer doing for you?  Julia Childs.  I went to 215.  It's the Ringling Brothers trainer.  He's trying to get him to stand on a box.  All right, yeah.  I'm like an elephant.  My head's sweating.  That was really good.  E-Rock, what happened with the trainer? 
[02:08:30]  What happened with the trainer?  No, wait.  Let him finish.  When you were with the trainer, you weighed in at 215?  No, no, no.  When I was with the trainer, I was 220, dropped down to about 215, and with that diet and that  protein stuff, I guess, whatever, I'm off to 227. 
[02:09:00]  Protein stuff, that's a comer.  Dr. Ian, you hear what he just said?  Now, how does that happen?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to go to the expert.  So, he goes to the trainer at 220 around Christmas?  It was after, yeah, after Christmas.  A little after Christmas, he goes to the trainer to get back in shape and to start eating, right?  So, he went from 220 to 215, and now today he's 227, and you're still seeing the trainer, right?  Yeah.  What do you think of that?  I'm on her diet and everything, too, with the bars and the shakes and all that. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  It's obvious what you and your trainer are really doing.  I mean, it ain't working out.  Listen to you, Ryan.  It ain't working out.  It ain't working out.  So, he's trying to say that he's gained muscle weight.  Yeah, right.  Oh, damn.  You got two weeks from today to lose 10 pounds.  I'm going to get Liza to send you a copy of the four-day diet.  You can follow the four-day diet.  You lose it, you get the dough.  If not, you get the schmo, baby.  What have you been eating that make you gain weight? 
[02:10:00]  Now, what happened?  During a diet.  Like, I mean, it's still regular food, but I don't even know if it's really the shakes.  Because Ope warned me about some of these protein things that you put in the shakes.  I did try to help you.  Yeah.  And she was insisting, no, this was fine or whatever.  Wait, hold on, Ope.  What did he eat in the rest area?  Cocked through a hole in the wall.  What did he eat in the rest area? 
[02:10:30]  I think it was his cheat day or something.  Oh, yeah.  And chicken.  And chicken?  It was more.  It was a chicken sandwich because you're out at that fucking Roy Rogers combo, everything there.  Oh, jeez.  You can't eat at fast food places.  It's the only place we can stomp at, so.  Hey, guys, I got a rock, but I'll call back in the week to see where you're in the week.  All right, take care, Ian.  We'll see you soon.  All right, Dr. Ian Smith in Philly.  His new book is called Happy.  I'm sure he's down there promoting that, so we'll talk to you soon, Ian. 
[02:11:00]  Steven asks from Bayshore, is his trainer Tom Carvel?  Oh.  Oh.  All right, so you got a new bet.  That's good.  You have another chance to get your money back.  But, Sam, you're not giving the $500 from yesterday back?  It's gone.  It's true?  You've been spending it?  Yeah.  What did you buy with the $500 that was E-Rox yesterday?  Well, E-Rox's friend of 13 years, Troy, wanted to take a girl out to a concert, so  ponying up some dough for some concert tickets for him.  I had some money.  Why not?  That's not. 
[02:11:30]  I had some money.  That's very generous of you, by the way.  That's not that bad, because you like Troy.  Yeah.  That is generous of you.  And they were like 50 bucks a piece, plus tax, so that's no big deal.  Still got money.  Me a bag of shells.  Had to get some new sneakers.  I don't have them on today.  I'll wear them tomorrow, maybe.  Yeah, you should.  You should wear them tomorrow.  You might as well.  And then, you know, make some purchases.  A little extra pocket money.  Yeah.  It's nice walking around with a little money in your pocket, right?  Yeah.  It's a little lighter.  Pocket money.  Stress-free.  My pocket money is there.  E-Rox used to enjoy his pocket money.  Pocket money.  Yeah.  Oh, that was ATM money, though. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, that wasn't even pocket money.  That was a big chunk of change.  That was 50s and 20s.  Just peeling them off.  I mean.  That was terrible.  And E-Rox was first texting with me, and then he stopped texting me.  Then he started texting with Troy.  Troy, and apparently, he told, Troy was trying to convince him to cool down because I needed  the money more than him anyway.  You do understand you're not getting this back.  Oh, yeah.  I'm well aware that I'm not getting that back.  And then Eric said he's done with everything. 
[02:12:30]  What do you mean everything?  The whole thing.  I was done with it.  By the time I was finished talking with Troy, I was just fed up.  Yeah.  Yep.  Fed up.  Wait, wait.  Let another fat joke come through.  No, I didn't say anything.  You said fed, though.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I mean.  Past tense.  Yeah, let it be known.  You might not want to use the word fed.  Another fat joke.  So he's got, hey, get a little E-Rox over there.  So you have to lose 10 pounds. 
[02:13:00]  10 pounds.  And you're 127.  227.  Oh, sorry.  Yes, 227.  Sam, are you willing to give a little money back if, like, E-Rox does something today?  Because for Cinco de Mayo, I'm thinking, you know.  Yeah, we could.  I'm thinking something.  I could pony up a little bit, I guess.  You're going to make him earn his portion of his money back?  If he could eat all my money.  If he could eat a whole, I don't know, thing of mayonnaise.  For Cinco de Mayo.  Now, for Cinco de Mayo, would you give some of the money back?  I mean, that's counterproductive to the bet, which would get him $500. 
[02:13:30]  He's got two weeks, though.  Yeah, he's got two weeks.  Think about it this way.  How much would you give E-Rox if he ate a jar of mayonnaise today?  Would you eat a full jar of mayonnaise?  You can't eat a full jar of mayonnaise.  Not with that attitude.  No.  You can't.  How about this?  So you're not willing to do that?  How about this, a bowl of ice cream smothered in mayonnaise?  That might be good.  How much of a jar of mayonnaise do you think you could put down in an hour? 
[02:14:00]  It's not going to be one of those big one things, no.  You could actually make money on this.  If you do this, then just bump it down for two weeks and lose weight.  I got 100.  Fuck it.  I'm in.  Wow.  I got 100.  Wow.  Whatever Sam puts on it.  I'll give you $100.  Which is just $100 from Opie.  A little bit funny because he said $110.  Yeah.  Sam, are you willing to throw some of the money back at him?  Yeah, I will.  I mean, this could be worse.  For what?  What's the wager? 
[02:14:30]  Well, he's got to eat.  Yeah, how much?  He's got to get a whole jar of mayonnaise down within an hour.  Are you going to do that, Eric?  You can't do a whole jar.  You can't do a whole jar.  How about you?  You can't.  You'll throw up.  What about if we prepare him a Sunday?  I don't care if you throw up as long as the fucking jar is empty.  I don't give a shit.  You could fucking purge like a teenage girl after you're done.  I don't care.  A nice ice cream sundae with mayonnaise instead of the chocolate toppings.  We could prepare it for him, obviously. 
[02:15:00]  What are we, fucking rookies?  It's a jar of mayonnaise.  Or we move on with the show.  It is just mayo.  Yeah, but you try eating half a jar of mayonnaise before you start throwing up.  All right.  Well, you can do that.  Well, at least try.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, I tried, goddammit.  At least I did that.  At least I fucking tried.  How about for 50 extra dollars?  Oh.  It doesn't matter how much money you throw at it.  You can't stomach it.  Obviously, Eric doesn't need the money.  But you throw up, and then you just get back in there. 
[02:15:30]  And you continue eating the mayo.  Jar of mayo.  Sink him to mayo, for Christ's sake.  Would we be willing to do it if we felt that he couldn't get through the jar of mayo, but if we all agree that he had given it his best effort?  Or should it be like, if he does half the jar, he gets half the money?  Oh, yeah.  We decide.  Oh, percentage.  That's not a good idea.  Percentage-wise of the jar.  We put some Sharpie marks on the jar.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And then you'll reach, like, there's the $10 mark. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  There's the $50 mark.  Don't forget, Opie's got $100.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I got $100, right?  Plus Sam's $50.  Look, I could probably pony up something.  Look, I got $100 right here in front of me.  So now you get $105?  I like it.  Come on.  It's Cinco de Mayo.  I'll put in $40.  What do you think?  I'll put in $50 for young E-Rock.  There you go.  You've got to give an old... 
[02:16:30]  I got a hundy.  If you make it impressive, you get the money.  There we go.  Wow.  There it is.  And then you don't have to be mad anymore.  Sam, where's your fucking money?  You're putting something in this.  I'll get it at $50.  $50?  All right.  And Ant's put in...  What kind of mayo do you like, E-Rock?  I thought you pocketed it and said Ant put in $5.  Oh, it's funny.  I would have, but I didn't.  I just held up the $100 like a cunt.  Here you are, sir.  God forbid I make a joke out of this. 
[02:17:00]  Stephen S. from Bayshore is asking, Anthony, Oph, are you giving two half thumbs up to  this bit?  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am.  What mayo?  It's got to be Hellman's.  Hellman's?  Yeah, yeah.  Hellman's is...  Low fat or are you going all in?  Oh, it can't be all low fat.  Well, low fat's pretty fucking brutal to get a whole jar down to.  Low fat's almost like a...  Actually, I think low fat would be worse.  How about Miracle Whip?  That's a salad dressing.  That's horrible.  All right, let's take a break. 
[02:17:30]  It's coming in too there like he's got to do it shirtless?  No.  Why?  Well...  What?  It's not coming in.  He has no information from anybody.  It's coming in.  That's how I process thoughts.  Yeah, Jimmy doesn't have a screen in front of a red thing.  It's coming in that...  He absolutely has nothing that could prove that the info was coming in.  He's got to lick it off a cock.  It's coming in.  It's coming in.  Yes!  Yeah, okay. 
[02:18:00]  Finally, I can contribute.  I love to eat a Nathan's hot dog through a hole.  All right, guys.  This is perfect.  Cinco de Mayo or Mayo.  My website is putitallbackon.com.  Yay!  He doesn't like that.  He smells like mint, by the way.  Really?  He hurt his back sleeping in the hospital three weeks ago, so every day he's doused in icy hot...  Oh, I've smelled the Ben Gay.  Yeah, he stinks like Ben Gay.  That's not how he bent his back.  I wear Steve Gay. 
[02:18:30]  That's good for my muscle.  He bent his back, leaning over to pick up gum out of someone's balls.  His baby's very cute, though.  You're a very cute baby.  Yeah?  Really, yes.  We're happy for Steve and his lovely, lovely girl there.  Yes.  All right, listen.  How many ounce jar, by the way?  Flames on the diapers.  He has a tattoo with a fucking foundry logo on it.  Mr. Carlisi, this is not a product.  This has got to do a regular size, don't we? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, just standard.  What's a regular size?  I don't know.  It's 12 ounce?  I don't know what it is.  It's like this big.  That's big, what you're showing.  But that's a regular bottle.  I think 16 ounce jar is the norm for Sam's Club.  Yeah, get one of those.  A big tub.  All right, they should be running out to the store.  They don't have to wait for one of you guys to actually...  And a giant spoon.  I want to see him eat it with a giant spoon.  Yeah.  A serving spoon.  A gravy ladle.  Yeah, exactly.  Something really big.  Something that makes like a... 
[02:19:30]  When you smack it in the jar.  How much we got?  I got 100.  We got 150 over here.  And you put a hundred?  300.  300.  That's $300.  Look who's smiling now that mayonnaise is all the talk.  Finally.  We'll take a break.  We'll get the jar of mayonnaise hopefully next.  And we'll start that up for the last hour of the show.  That's it, man.  All right?  Oh, great.  Yeah?  Is that it?  Okay.  I'm a little teapot.  Short and stout.

I don't know, because according to recent shoppers at Beezid.com, your pulse might jump and your  body might start to sweat when you shop over there at Beezid.com.  You mean it actually may be fun to shop, Anthony? 
[02:35:30]  Yes, Opie.  Shopping at Beezid.com is extremely exciting and unlike any online experience.  At Beezid.com, you could save up to 99% off retail on brand name, electronics, appliances,  laptops, cameras, gift cards, and even cars.  Cars.  Huh?  Guess how much a new 2010 sports car valued at just under 30 grand sold for this past Tuesday.  I have no idea, Anthony.  It sold to a listener from Texas for an unbelievable price of $719.66. 
[02:36:00]  Wow, that's crazy.  Ready to get blown away?  This is what sold last week on Beezid.com.  A MacBook went for 99 cents and a PS3 gaming console went for $1.85.  A fully loaded camcorder.  How about that for 66 cents?  That's 66 cents.  A maxi pad sold for...  No, no, it's iPad.  Oh, an iPad sold for $4.02 and a 37-inch LCD TV sold for $1.95. 
[02:36:30]  So what are you waiting for?  Go out and win something for yourself or for your mom for Mother's Day this weekend.  Yes, go to Beezid.com and use the offer code MOM and they're going to double up on any  bid pack you buy in the next 24 hours.  Use offer code MOM.  Buzz on over to Beezid.com.  That's B-E-E-Z-I-D.com.  Hey, this is Victoria Gotti.  Hey, this is Don Cain.  Because I talk to guys that found the black boxes and yet our government says they weren't 
[02:37:00]  discovered.  Why?  This is Jesse Ventura.  Hey, this is Michio Kaku and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  All right, well, we're going to do the mayo thing for Cinco de Mayo.  Cinco de Mayo.  Get it? 
[02:37:30]  Get it because everyone else is.  All right.  And let's not forget, we're also going to be doing cherry darts.  I'm trying to do the math.  A week from Friday looks like it.  Yes.  A week from Friday we do cherry darts.  If you want to be involved in this, the email address is Opie Anthony at Travis, do you  know?  SiriusXM.com.  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com. 
[02:38:00]  Okay.  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  Just like that.  If you want to be part of cherry darts, we've got some great prizes and stuff that we'll  explain as we get closer to the contest.  But at least, if you're interested, get a hold of Danny through OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  Okay?  Yes.  And let's not forget, Anthony will be on Hannity tonight, so make sure you take a peek at that.  Okay?  Certainly will.  Before we do Cinco de Mayo, we should talk about the Times Square Bomber.  We got all the latest info here.  The latest.  All the latest. 
[02:38:30]  Do we have the latest accurate info like we had yesterday?  I think we were pretty accurate, no?  Are you saying we were a little off yesterday?  Uh, just a tad.  We were basically...  We might have jumped to conclusion.  Jumped to conclusion, Matt.  We were basically telling the world yesterday that they were onto this guy, following him  for a good day or so.  The entire time, and...  ...hastising every news agency for saying that this gentleman almost got away.  And we got him in the nick of time.  And we were saying, no, dummies.  They were watching him the entire time. 
[02:39:00]  They let him get on the plane so they could see who he was hanging out with and what he was  doing, and then let him back out of the gate to see if he contacted anyone.  And then they had the plane come back and go to the jetway and the customs came in and  grabbed him.  Right.  And it was a genius, genius ploy that worked.  And meanwhile, we were yelling at the news for saying that he almost got away.  He was seconds away from taking off.  And the truth of the matter is, he almost got away and he was seconds away from taking 
[02:39:30]  off and we were completely wrong.  It was that close?  Yeah.  Where did we get our info from?  We were pretty confident.  I don't know.  We certainly were.  We were cock sure.  Oh, fuck yeah.  We were cock sure.  And we have microphones, so we figured, what the fuck, we're experts.  Exactly.  Just like anyone else.  But, boy, were we wrong.  Well, here's your bullet points on this guy.  Admitted everything to investigators and said...  Yes.  But that's not true because they're arresting people in Pakistan, right?  I'm calling him the unibrow-er. 
[02:40:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, get it?  Not really.  Look at his picture.  Stop.  Okay.  I thought they got Sully from Godsmack, personally.  Oh, really?  You think it's a little Sully look to him?  Especially with the sunglasses on.  Not so much when the sunglasses are off.  Reportedly did it in retaliation for U.S. drone attack that killed Taliban leaders in  August.  Mm-hmm.  SUV was packed with the wrong explosive materials, which is why the bomb didn't go off.  Yeah, he used the wrong type of fertilizer.  He's a dummy. 
[02:40:30]  He bought a bunch of bags of the wrong type of fertilizer.  And there's the right kind, and we probably shouldn't tell people.  No, everybody knows it's ammonium nitrate.  Well, maybe you shouldn't say that because I don't think everybody knows that.  All right.  I'll take it back.  Uh, Pakistani officials claim that up to eight people have been arrested there in connection  with the attack.  So, if he's saying he's acted alone, he acted alone, why are they arresting people in Pakistan?  Eh?  Mm-mm. 
[02:41:00]  Claims to have trained at a terrorist camp in Pakistan.  Now, I don't know.  I don't think anyone's getting away with this in the year 2010.  Yeah.  You can't fly to, you can't fly from New York to Columbus like this.  It says he made his flight reservation on the way to JFK and paid for his ticket in cash,  and he had no luggage.  And it's a one-way flight.  So, no, I don't, and he nearly got away anyway?  Yeah.  And that red flag?  He was on the no-fly list, the electronic no-fly list from Monday. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  He was on there.  Do they put him on there quickly?  Yeah, quickly they put it on.  Okay.  But Emirates Airline either ignored it or had some kind of a problem, a delay, they said,  in their updating of the no-fly list.  They have an outdated list.  Yeah.  But if it's popped into a computer, how could it ever be outdated?  That's what people are saying.  Do you know what?  The penalty for that should be so fucking harsh.  Like, the airlines in general want to fuck us for blanket money and money for pillows 
[02:42:00]  or whatever.  The penalty for allowing that to happen should be they either remove all of your routes  for a week, and they should destroy you financially for that.  If you let somebody who's on the no-fly list on your plane, yeah, you should get fucked.  It should be your responsibility.  Well, why was he paying for his ticket in cash?  That's a giveaway.  That's the biggest red flag going.  That's huge.  And he doesn't have luggage on top of it.  So why, they're saying he almost got away and he was on the plane, but why was he even 
[02:42:30]  allowed to board the plane?  That's enough suspicion to kind of, like, have him look that closer, right?  Yeah.  And he, the only way they found out was customs agents went over the paper copies of the no-fly  list and found him and found the guy's name and said, oh, well, look who's on that plane.  Now, the FBI was trailing him, so we were sort of right for a little bit.  Yeah, they were.  We were basically wrong.  We could accept that.  FBI trailed him leaving a grocery store on Monday but lost him. 
[02:43:00]  Original plan was to arrest him at his apartment Monday evening.  Yep.  How do you fucking lose him?  If they're being truthful.  He's the most wanted guy.  Unless there's, the only thing I would say, unless there's something that they would rather  look like asses who lost him instead of give away something.  Like if there's a piece of, what's the word I'm looking for?  A technique that they employed or somebody that they used that they don't want to give  away, they'd rather go, ah, we lost him and then caught him.  I know what happened. 
[02:43:30]  What?  He was in the grocery store.  The FBI was there.  And the FBI guy goes, you know what?  I'm in the grocery store.  I might as well go get my mom a Mother's Day car.  Mother's Day car.  He's not going anywhere.  See, he should have ordered from one of our fantastic sponsors.  Figured, what the hell?  Look at a few cards while he's in here.  And he wouldn't have lost them.  Ah, right.  You did the out-of-date list.  Yeah.  Let's see.  A series of phone calls was placed from Pakistan to a prepaid phone that was activated on April  16th and deactivated on April 28th. 
[02:44:00]  Why do they give us all this info?  I was talking to Anthony about this.  I don't understand why they need to give the public all this info right away.  On how they do things?  Right.  I don't get it.  You know, eventually I'd like to know some of this info, but not less than 24 hours after  it all goes down.  Yeah, this all happened very quickly.  And he worked as a financial analyst in Connecticut, so kind of lived like a regular Joe for a while.  A regular guy, except he built a half-assed bomb. 
[02:44:30]  And, yeah, he wasn't on the electronic no-fly list, so the customs guy grabbed him.  And the plane was taxing.  It was taxing to the runway to take off.  Wow.  And air traffic controlled him back.  There's actually audio of that.  Yeah, we got that.  So what you're about to hear is the audio from the plane.  The plane and the tower and ground control there talking to each other.  So they were heading for takeoff. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  And this is the audio basically telling the pilot, you know what, can you please come back?  Yeah.  Problem here.  Wow.  Yeah.  One, two, three, Nonna, Emirates.  Two, zero, two, good on.  Emirates, two, two, heavy Kennedy, tower, runway two, two, right position.  Actually, I have a message for you to go back to the gate immediately, so make the left turn when able.  So, two, two, two, zero, two, turning left here.  Hi, Emirates, two, zero, two, make the left turn on to Echo, left Alpha, back to the ramp. 
[02:45:30]  I don't know exactly why, but you can call your company for the reason.  We'll do that.  Left on to Echo, then on to Alpha and back to the gate.  Via Golf?  Yes, whatever is convenient.  Emirates, two, zero, two.  We'll do that.  We'll do that.  Amherst, two, two, heavy.  Amherst, two, two, heavy, go ahead.  Yes, ma'am.  We're trying to figure out what's going on here right now, but as far as we know, I'd like to request you to just keep the flatline open for now. 
[02:46:00]  Amherst, two, heavy, no problem.  The flight plan's good for another two hours.  Yeah, good luck.  Keep the flight plan open for two hours.  Yeah, yeah, that'll be all settled in two hours.  I don't think they had that flight plan.  Do you know, this is even more satisfying.  That asshole was headed out towards the runway.  Wow.  And then all of a sudden, they made a left.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's even worse.  Wait a minute, but the runway's over there.  We have been called, because I guarantee you they said, ladies and gentlemen, we've been called back to the gate. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  We're going to, it might be some kind of a manifest issue.  Yeah, yeah.  He knew.  We've been called back to the gate.  We'll be returning to the gate.  Our flight plan is still open for a couple of hours, so no need.  We will be leaving shortly, I'm sure.  That guy must have been like, oh, they got me.  Oh, they got me.  I was just, he was probably sitting there like, it's going to be, yeah, I hope takeoff's nice and smooth. 
[02:47:00]  Here it goes.  I go, oh, wait a minute, we're turning.  Why are we turning?  Damn.  Yeah, see, so we were a little wrong.  They were pretty close to us.  Maybe they were, but again.  Wow.  I'm not 100% ready to give up, because what bothered me with the theory of they wanted to see who walked away from the gate,  who might have been there for him, was that if they just let the plane door close,  and people might not walk away right away, but if they actually let it back out and take off for a second,  then whoever really was, if there was somebody in that waiting area monitoring him for his own sake, 
[02:47:30]  by that point they would have gotten up and left.  So they may have wanted the plane just to really look like it, knowing that they were not going to allow that thing to take off.  You know what?  I don't know.  It seems like you're really kind of using the other passengers as guinea pigs, because you don't know.  I mean, the guy's been through security and everything, but you don't know how desperate he is and what he might do.  That's true.  He may have something shoved up his ass, a bomb.  You're right.  That's true.  You don't know.  And believe me, there's plenty of shit to grab on a plane in the galley. 
[02:48:00]  There's just shit like this.  Plenty of sharp things.  You're right.  You know, just a desperate guy.  I don't know.  They probably wouldn't, because if somebody even got, like, anything, just punched a pregnant woman,  they would say that did not have to happen.  Did not have to happen.  Why did they let the plane get as far as it did?  Let's go to Scott in Wisconsin.  Maybe that's why they're saying they lost him, so they don't have to deal with that.  Yeah, true.  Scott.  Morning, boys.  Hi.  Hey, Scott.  What?  After listening to your fine program yesterday, I went into the truck stop to get breakfast and 
[02:48:30]  watching Fox News, and they're talking about how they almost let him get away.  And I said, no.  They had to finish me off the whole day.  You were wrong the whole day?  Well, we've taught you guys a lot of stuff over the years, and the one thing we've said  many, many times is not to listen to the media, okay?  And we are part of the media.  Right.  No matter how much we hate it, we're part of the very media that we tell you not to listen to. 
[02:49:00]  Right.  Can somebody send Love Buzz in here?  What did Love Buzz do?  He's as dumb as they fucking come.  What was your first clue?  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  Sorry about that.  What happened to Love Buzz?  What did Love Buzz do?  Oh, no.  I see already what he did.  Here comes cartoon voice.  Love Buzz.  Love Buzz.  Jimmy wants to talk to you.  Jimmy's got a problem.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Love Buzz.  You kind of look like the bomber guy.  I do? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you kind of do, actually.  Yeah, you kind of do.  You got the big Oz.  You got the beard mustache thing.  What did you order?  Latte with nonfat milk.  Oh, is that what this is?  Yeah.  Really?  Because it says Grandi iced coffee.  I did ask them.  Is this a medium?  It's the furthest thing away from the lot.  I did ask them.  It's a medium.  I really did. 
[02:50:00]  It could be medium shit.  Which is what it is.  Okay, here's what we can do.  He's throwing the straw away.  Thank you very much.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Are you saying the order's wrong?  Yeah.  The order's wrong.  Well, Buzz, I think we should be allowed to pour the entire fucking beverage down the  front of your pants.  I don't know if that's a good idea.  Well, I think it is a good idea, just to teach you a lesson.  I was going to have him bring it back.  Oh, really?  Yes. 
[02:50:30]  Why?  You want to save the two bucks?  I would like my beverage.  It'll go out and get another beverage with wet pants.  In my defense, I do ask them a lot.  Like, I ask them, medium iced coffee with nonfat milk.  There you go.  You just said it.  I told them that, though.  Yeah, that's wrong.  Medium iced coffee.  You just said it.  He just did say it, yeah.  See, a latte's very different than an iced coffee.  What are you supposed to say?  I'm sorry, Jimmy. 
[02:51:00]  You just said it.  I'm only mad because I said to him when he walked in, what'd you order me with medium  iced latte?  Right.  He said it right.  And then, there, you must have said medium iced coffee, didn't you?  Of course, he just said it to two countries.  Didn't you?  Yeah.  Well, I have it in my phone.  Medium iced latte.  Well, I got it.  But it came out of your mouth.  It came out of your phone.  But Love Buzz, when they hand you the beverage, it's very obvious that it's not what you told  him.  I've never dealt with this before.  Should we pour it down his pants?  I don't know if I want to drink it or not. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  Love Buzz stinks.  I love Angry Jimmy.  Get over it, princess.  I don't want to be Angry Jimmy.  I just wanted something because I'm tired.  People, I get no sleep.  Love Buzz versus Bobo.  Who's the bigger retard?  Bobo lost weight, by the way.  All right, love us.  Thank you.  Jim Norton.  Latte diva.  Oh, he's walking out all sad now.  He should.  Throw it in his face.  He should.  He's all sad now.  Do you understand?  He said latte right.  And then he went and said...  You tripped him up like one of those dummies on the witness stand. 
[02:52:00]  Alex, he just...  What?  You should have saw what just happened outside the studio.  Well, I'm the one who handed him the what?  Love Buzz walks up to Kenny, and Kenny gave him the look of such disapproval.  Holy shit.  Because he made a mistake.  Like, love is his own son.  He made a mistake.  And then Love Buzz shrugged off like, I'd let everyone down.  He did.  All right.  Here is Jim Norton on Red Eye last night.  About the Times Square bomber.  Well, we should be focusing on the Keystone cops that were, you know, 
[02:52:30]  apparently they had the guy.  They were sitting watching him at the house, and then he disappears.  That's according to officials today.  I don't know.  During a news conference.  I think they might have...  Right?  No, I think they were following him.  Following him the whole time.  I think they were following him the whole time.  The report that they were following him the whole time.  Yes.  And then I think they allowed the gate to...  They probably allowed the plane to back out.  Because then you see who gets up and leaves the gate area.  They wanted to make sure they got everybody.  That's what they were saying earlier.  But now everybody's saying...  You know, now you did...  Many officials that you talked to, a lot of these investigators just say,  we would never do something like that.  And when she said that's what they were saying earlier, 
[02:53:00]  then basically she was quoting us.  It's like, that's a they...  By the way, they was us.  Yeah, we were the only ones saying that.  Saying that, yeah.  Jimmy took that knowledge to red-eye.  I didn't know what I was talking about.  You took the knowledge from this dicky show to Fox News.  I couldn't have had a shittier source than this room.  Yeah.  In fairness...  I don't even know where it...  I can't remember where it even came from.  Gutfeld kind of was agreeing with me.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  No, man, there was...  But Juliet Huddy was right.  There was something that was out first Sunday morning saying that.  Really?  Yes, if Gutfeld was saying it too.  He wasn't listening to our show.  Who came up with the...  They were following him.  They let the plane back out.  Was that just us speculating?  I don't remember hearing it or reading it anywhere.  Here's how I remember it.  One of you looking at the TV and then saying it.  And I'm like, well, that must be a fact.  I'm a dumb asshole. 
[02:54:00]  We're as dumb as they call it.  Oh, we suck.  Oh, well.  Oops.  Did you see the...  The other day I said it with, like I was just thinking of it.  Like, no, no, no, I heard.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  That's cute, what you just said.  But here's what the real deal is.  And Juliette and Ann Coulter and Bill Schultz and Greg were all listening intently to someone  who sounded like he might know what he was talking about.  I got the inside poop on this one.  I got the skinny, folks.  Simmer down.  Here it comes.  I knew nothing. 
[02:54:30]  Take your facts and throw them away.  Well, at least you didn't say what CNN said.  Hear this clip yet?  We, I think, trashed them for this.  Oh, you did?  Oh, but the luggage, yes.  Oh, you talked about this on Red Eye?  This fucking CNN cunt, yes.  In case people didn't hear.  And if it can be confirmed that his house was foreclosed on in recent years, I mean,  one would have to imagine that that brought a lot of pressure and a lot of heartache on  that family.  See, it's all bullshit.  We got it wrong.  CNN gets it wrong. 
[02:55:00]  Why do we have to fucking beat ourselves up every time something like this happens?  It's ours.  Or somehow the country's fault.  Yeah, it's the fucking, it's all this root cause garbage argument.  And somehow the root cause always means the U.S. wrong.  We deserve it.  We deserve it.  Some friggin' savage decides he wants to kill Americans.  And we got to figure out how to spin it around and blame it on our little selves.  And it's like the pussy mayor in this city, fucking Bloomberg. 
[02:55:30]  First thing he says is about backlash against Pakistanis.  Shut your fucking mouth.  There was only a couple of incidents.  No one's going to go out and just beat up Muslims.  Shut your, when New Yorkers were almost killed or Americans were almost murdered by some fucking  dirtbag, I'm not concerned with backlash.  That's not my first thought.  Sorry, fucking asshole mayor.  I do not feel safe with Bloomberg at all.  Bloomberg was the one that was saying before they got this guy that, you know, it's probably, 
[02:56:00]  he said it's probably somebody that's upset with the government or taxes.  Or, or then he mentioned somebody who doesn't agree with the healthcare bill.  Yeah, some lone nut.  What a jerk off.  And then he turns around when they find out it's an Islamic extremist.  Instead of saying that, he's like, hey, now we don't want any backlash.  Let's be nice to everybody.  Yeah, fucking liberal cunt.  I really hate Bloomberg, man. 
[02:56:30]  I used to like him a lot, but I really fucking hate this guy.  He's an ass.  I don't think he's a terrible mayor.  I really don't.  I just don't like him.  I think that as a guy, he makes me sick.  I don't think he's a terrible mayor.  Why did I say that twice?  Why wouldn't I just say it once?  This silence is what I deserve.  Yeah.  Well, just indifference.  No, it's correct.  I'm just, I'm just, somebody bring up the fact that it's Islamic extremists. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Can somebody in this politically correct fucking joke administration,  just bring that up instead of blaming everything else and the tea party people, blaming the  tea party people.  Oh my God.  Right.  I can't stand this.  The way they blame it.  Fuck you with the tea party people.  I don't, I don't, you know, no one's blaming fucking liberal protesters. 
[02:57:30]  No one thought it might be immigrants.  I didn't think that it was, it's amazing how they go right for the, they politicize everything.  When this happened, I didn't think, I'll bet it's people who are, liberals who are against  the Arizona law.  I didn't think that.  It didn't occur to me.  Yeah.  That it was, it was liberals doing it.  So why is their first thought that it's a fucking tea partier?  Yeah.  You assholes.  Yeah.  Um, let's go to Dallas.  Blue, uh, let's get on a plane.  Blue works in, in, in, uh, intelligence. 
[02:58:00]  Blue, blue and Dallas.  Yes.  Oh, I thought that was a verb.  What's up blue.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hey, uh, I absolutely agree with you.  This is something that I've spent my entire adult life in the Intel business, and this  is something that in, in today's society, in the liberal media, Anthony, I completely  agree with you.  I know that the people that do the work are never going to tell the truth to the media.  The media is asking for information and hounding the public affairs department. 
[02:58:30]  We're never going to tell the truth.  You know, if we tell the truth, ah, well, we lost him for a couple hours.  We didn't fucking lose him.  Let me, we know where he's at.  Oh, really?  He was doing, he was doing something that we don't want the public to know about.  We don't want the people he was doing it with to know he was doing it.  Oh, really?  That's how this shit works.  I, I kind of believe that a little bit.  I, why, why would he be so anxious to tell the media everything about what went down?  Why do you think they kept showing that picture of that guy in that red shirt? 
[02:59:00]  I, I, I firmly believe that was a, a, a diversion so this guy wouldn't panic or the people  he was dealing with would think, heck, hey, there's a little bit of time to get away.  They're all looking for a white guy.  Why would you make yourself look incompetent, though, by letting the plane pull away and  let everybody think that he was seconds away from getting away and that a customs agent  made the fucking grab on him instead of, you know, the FBI that was following him.  Because the bigger picture might have been.  Yeah, because, because we don't give a fuck what you think. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, really?  We're doing our job.  What the general public thinks about how we're doing our job is irrelevant.  We're getting it done.  Are you really an intelligence or are you just a, a, a, a crazy person?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, he sounds legit, Jimmy, doesn't he?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He might be very legit, but he might just be a guy that, like, has had this psychotic  conversation alone, like that he's an intelligence officer. 
[03:00:00]  What branch of the service do you work in, sir?  And I'm not saying you're not legit.  I'm just.  I was in the Navy for about seven years.  Did you sell the seven seas?  Yes.  I sell three of them.  That's good enough.  Do you ever see Felipe Rose and Victor Willis in Navy outfits?  I loved in Navy outfits.  But no, I, I've been over to Afghanistan twice in the last four years.  So yeah, I, I've been in the Intel business for the last, uh, 17.  I tend to think this guy knows what he's talking about.  I, I, cause it's weird to me that they would just give up all that info to the media. 
[03:00:30]  Come on.  It's almost like strange to me.  The only way to explain, say hours two through five would be to give out information they  don't want to give out, like he went to see so-and-so in Park Ridge.  Right.  Maybe they don't want people in Park Ridge to know that they're onto them.  So they say, we lost them for a couple hours.  So they don't panic and close up their operation.  I believe they use the media to their advantage.  Yeah.  To, you know, like you said, maybe the guy in Times Square, the balding white guy was,  uh, you know, just to throw everybody.  Oh, well, throw that guy off for a while. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  A red herring.  Yeah.  A red herring.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's the red herring.  Because we start calling out that, you know, what he exactly looks like and all this,  we're going to get a ton of leads that are going to get us nowhere because everybody  wants to be the fucking hero.  I need to change his appearance.  He's going to put on a hat or maybe, uh, maybe nail a propeller to his head.  I don't know what people do to disguise themselves.  They're going to get a hat, Jimmy, from Ted's Emporium.  You know that.  Come on.  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  I would like to know what the real deal is because it's hard to, hard to believe the FBI actually  lost him.  But then it goes back to Anthony's point. 
[03:01:30]  Like, why would the FBI, you know, want to throw that info out that makes them look  incompetent?  Yeah, because this guy says they don't care.  Right.  There's pride in the agencies.  That's what I'm thinking.  There's definitely agency pride where they like to, you know, have made the collar, uh,  you know, bring the guy in.  I don't think they like being overshadowed by customs walking in that plane and hauling  this guy off of the fucking plane.  Although, to allow this guy to get on the plane and to allow it to pull away for whatever  reason.  Tell your wife to shut the fuck up. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Dog smells peanut butter.  So, he was quietly taking oven mitts out of the drawer as he continued to fucking  fuck up.  You hear duct tape tearing.  It's like, no, not today.  You hear the drip, drip, drip of her vaginal juices.  I'm the linoleum.  Within two seconds, he goes from intelligence agents to his wife is having a pussy lick by  a dog.  By a German shepherd.  We suck.  Or a mastiff.  A dog like Hooch that just drips spit on her back while it fucks her. 
[03:02:30]  There might be something to it because he just hung up.  Of course he did.  But she, I bet you the only Navy connection he has is he wipes the dog's cum off her back  with a Navy hat and he wears it.  Makes his fucking, I'm an intelligence officer speech into a mirror.  I'm sorry.  So, you probably are legit.  I'm kidding.  All right.  Well, everyone's just speculating though.  Even him as an intelligence agency employee.  I don't believe that the media is, whatever.  It's the same old shit we talk about.  I don't believe it's 100% how they're telling us. 
[03:03:00]  Maybe there's times they want to look good.  Maybe in the middle of investigations, they don't care.  But something did get screwed up to have the plane pull away and it's heading toward a  takeoff.  That's assuming a lot that the pilot's going to get that call in the nick of time.  Not only that, the pilot doesn't know anything.  That's his fucking ship.  Right.  And that pilot would be fucking pissed if they knew all this that was going on and  he wasn't told.  Right.  And he wasn't fucking told what was going on.  So maybe that's why they say there was a customs error because they understand the 
[03:03:30]  backlash, but the reality is they had to watch that waiting area.  Why not tell that fucking pilot though, hey, here's a guy on your fucking plane.  Maybe they did.  That pilot would have won an Oscar then for his fucking like, hey, what the hell's going  on?  We got to go back to the gate.  Well, maybe he didn't need to know.  And who has all those phone numbers?  Yeah, exactly.  All of a sudden you go out of your cell and go, all right, I got the number for the tower.  Yeah, here it is. 
[03:04:00]  Let me get the number for the tower.  I'm Joe FBI.  Yeah, you don't trust the pilot.  They have to listen to us.  Fuck the pilot.  He'll come back when you tell him.  What if the pilot goes, you know, fuck you, I don't, I'm, I'm taking off and I'll deal  with the consequences when I land on the other side.  Consequences, consequences, wrong as I'm rich.  Who the fuck knows?  But I think that if, again, we may be totally wrong, but I could see them allowing that plane  to clear totally.  Yeah.  Just to see who walked away from that gate area or to see if there was anything.  Because that way it looks like it's going away.  Let's lock up every haji that was hanging out by the gate. 
[03:04:30]  Oh yeah, don't be fresh.  That's what I say.  That's everyone.  It's an Emirates flight to Dubai.  What do you think?  It's all Irish?  I guess you're right.  Emirates fright.  Fright.  Yeah, didn't you say that?  Where's it going?  You ever walk through an international airport?  It gets scary when you see some of these fucking areas.  Yes.  All right, why don't we, well, no.  Let's get the sweetie in here.  Yeah, let's get the mayo thing going.  It's Cinco de Mayo.  Mayo.  See how clever we are?  E-Rock has $350 in front of him here.  If he could get a whole jar of mayo down in the next hour. 
[03:05:00]  $350?  I had a $300 count.  Sam's throwing $50 in.  Yeah, I know.  I counted that.  Opie's $100.  Anthony's $100.  Yeah.  My $50.  Okay, $300.  Sam's $50.  $300.  Oh, the Mexican hat dance.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Mmm.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I like the African-American hat dance that we saw on the elevator.  It's a good one.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[03:05:30]  Down she goes.  You know how creeped out a girl gets if you're in a nightclub and you're holding a drink and  you just stand in front of her and do that?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Just stare at her.  Yeah.  And make the Mexican hat dance noise without smiling or blinking.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Like almost accusing her, being a whore.  I don't think you're going home with her that evening.  Not really.  No, not voluntarily anyway.  Yeah.  On her part.  Funny joke.  How about this? 
[03:06:00]  If you're a cat, you're going to do a Mexican cat dance.  Somewhere Collins doubled over.  Yeah, I just love it.  Oh, yeah, I told you.  Patrice was enjoying a little chip yesterday.  He was getting the vibe of the chip.  He was.  Where's E-Rock?  Let's get this going, man.  Yeah, where is he?  E-Rock.  Come on, sweetie pie.  Oh, you get the mayo?  Oh, hi, my love.  Where's Sam?  He's going to watch this.  That is a lot of mayo.  How many ounces? 
[03:06:30]  That's standard.  Yeah.  Get to the table, E-Rock.  We got a mic up here.  This is a...  Over here.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Sorry.  Right on the table.  That's all I'm thinking now.  This is 30 ounces.  Yeah.  And let's check the nutrition.  Oh, it's Hellman's real mayonnaise.  One tablespoon...  Is that a serving?  ...is 90 calories.  Oh, shit.  How many tablespoons in the whole time?  Calories from fat, 90.  Okay.  Total fat, 10 grams.  Oh, shit. 
[03:07:00]  Sodium, 90 milligrams.  And that's in one tablespoon?  And five milligrams of cholesterol.  Oh, shit.  So how many tablespoons are in that?  How many servings?  60.  60 servings is five...  Do some math.  That's 5,400 calories.  Now, wait a minute.  60 times 90.  Yes, you're right, Oak.  Why are we so bad at this part?  The math part.  Math is hard.  Math is hard.  I got it right.  It's all numbers.  5,400 calories. 
[03:07:30]  5,400 calories.  You're going to attempt to eat 5,400 calories.  5 milligrams a tablespoon.  5 milligrams.  Times 90, that's 300.  No, times 60.  300.  300 milligrams.  300 milligrams.  And what's the daily allowance of cholesterol?  Not that.  I would assume it wasn't a full jar of almonds.  That covers them up to 2013.  I don't even think it's healthy to have one tablespoon of mayo a day.  No, no.  Day in and day out.  The percent daily values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. 
[03:08:00]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going through the window right now.  What's the percent on cholesterol?  Out the window, E-Rock.  You don't say through the window.  2%.  2%.  All right.  Close enough.  2%.  It is close enough, E-Rock.  2%.  All right.  You're going to attempt this?  Yeah.  So we got $300 on the line.  E-Rock is going to attempt to eat a whole jar of mayonnaise with a really big oversized spoon. 
[03:08:30]  With a happy face in it.  Oh, wow.  It does have a happy face in it.  Now, E-Rock, how many spoons do you eat before it starts getting ugly?  Jesus, it's getting ugly.  I'd say about five, and it's going to really start to get ugly.  Before you eat five, you ain't not going to get five giant spoonfuls.  Of those big spoonfuls?  What guarantees him $100?  Because he's not eating that whole thing.  I think that we all have to think, we have to make an informed judgment.  On that side, please. 
[03:09:00]  Thank you.  We have to make an informed judgment that E-Rock has honestly done the best he could and gotten as much data.  And that he's not being, excuse my language, a big faker.  Yeah.  Is that spoon going to fit in the jar?  It doesn't fit?  No.  I looked at it and was like, that doesn't...  All right.  Well, then you have to use your fingers.  Do we have a spoon?  You can use your hand to get another spoon.  It's mayo.  It's not like it's fucking...  No, I can't fit my hand in there.  It's not rubber bands.  Hold on.  Get a spoon. 
[03:09:30]  Mayo in the jar-row.  All right.  Here's...  Now it's a little spoon, but it's a soup spoon.  It's the plastic soupy spoon.  All right, E-Rock, you got an hour.  Okay.  So I'll just go sit back over there.  Oh, no.  We want to start over here.  You got to start over here, you know.  All right.  It's like the finish line.  We want to get a general feel for it.  Or the starting line.  I like mayo with a little tuna fish and some celery in there.  Isn't that good?  Yeah.  You give yourself an English muffin with mayo and some tuna fish. 
[03:10:00]  I like the tuna fish.  That's good.  When you put some mayo on your tuna fish, that tastes good.  And then you get it all up there nice and creamy and you eat it on some saltings.  Ah, it's just a great snack to have around the house.  Your mayo.  Wow, I thought that was a glass jar.  It's plastic, so you can actually squeeze it out into your mouth.  It looks like it's pink socking out of the top of the...  Should I just bite into a chunk of mayo?  Yes.  You should. 
[03:10:30]  All right, E-Rock, let's go.  Bite into a chunk of mayo.  He's just going to squeeze it out and bite into it.  Like a big ice cream cone.  $300 up for grabs.  He's actually doing that with a glass that's how hungry he is.  He's going to squeeze it out of mayo in an hour.  All right.  And he is about to begin.  He's been helping on mayonnaise.  Ah, for Cinco de Mayo.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what do you think, E-Rock?  Your mouth looks like Steve.  You want a napkin?  Yes.  How was that first heaping half of it? 
[03:11:00]  First one, not bad.  That's delicious.  Yeah, the first one you got to appreciate.  The boy does love his mayonnaise.  He's a sweetie.  He really does love his mayo.  All right, but that's the first one.  Yeah.  Do you know what would make this bit perfect?  What?  He wouldn't do it.  What?  If he was naked except for his underwear, and we could snap his tits with rubber bands.  As he ate the mayo, yes.  Wonderful.  What's the matter?  You need a lot of napkins and stuff.  It went up my nose a little bit.  Oh, it did? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, that'll happen.  Up your nose with a rubber hose.  Oh, come on.  Get a heaping spoonful of that mayonnaise.  There's the second heaping spoonful of mayo.  Still good?  You know what?  I want to get it to the point where it's not good.  He's loving this.  He's loving this so far.  He is loving this.  This is a big ruse.  No, it's not.  Because he made it sound like, ew, we gave him a bunch of money.  This is like someone going, oh, wow, I'm going to give you a fucking lobster tail.  Nope.  And if you eat it, I'll give you 200 bucks.  You might be right.  This boy loves his mayo. 
[03:12:00]  It's true.  That's two.  So far, you're all in?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Washing it down with a little Gatorade.  Here goes spoonful number three.  He's washing it down with some low-calorie Gatorade.  G2 grape.  G2 grape.  That's wonderful.  Here comes the third heaping spoon of mayo.  Big spoon full of mayo.  Ow.  There he goes.  Number three.  How's it getting?  That was not quite as easily going down.  Yeah, what's the matter?  Shouldn't have had the Gatorade, but. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, the Gatorade made it a little odd.  You might want to go to water to help.  I say Gatorade.  Worsh it down.  Gatorade.  Worsh it.  You gotta worship it down with some water.  Get a battle of water.  Wash that down.  That was three.  Here comes number four.  Number four.  That really makes that spoon stand straight up when you put it in there, huh?  Yeah, that's thick.  Thick, creamy, real mayo.  Number four.  None of that low-fat shit.  There's number four.  There you go.  He is up to how many fucking calories? 
[03:13:00]  I'll be dead.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Say something else quick.  I don't want those as your last hour.  That was 360 calories.  360 calories.  Your mom's, uh.  No.  Not bad.  Here comes number five.  Your mom's male.  Here comes number five.  Number five.  Big.  Nice.  Another.  He's already slowing down.  No, it's coating the teeth.  Is it?  Oh, you're very un-kissable right now. 
[03:13:30]  It's coating the teeth.  Number five?  Is that five?  That's great.  And here it comes.  Number six.  Number six.  Do you know what your shit is going to be like, dude?  That is going to lube everything up.  Yeah.  It's going to slide out of you like a water slide.  If you blink your eyes too hard, shit's going to fall out.  Yeah.  I think your kidney's going to slide out.  This is number six?  Your logs are going through your digestive tract like Splash Mountain right now. 
[03:14:00]  Number six is down.  Uh-oh.  That's not quite as delish.  No.  No, it's starting to get to you a little bit.  Yeah.  Can he stop trying to be sexy leaning against the window?  He is.  What a jerk with a GQ pose.  All right. 
[03:14:30]  I think he's going to try for number seven.  He'll get it.  He's doing fine.  Number seven is in.  Seven big heaping scoops of mayonnaise.  Let me see in the top of that jar how much is left.  Have you made a dent in it?  Yeah.  It's a dent, but it's that skinny part of the jar.  Oh, no.  It's starting to fatten out now.  I'm starting to hit the label.  Yeah, the label is the thickest part of that.  He's doing all right, though.  Say what you want about E-Rog, but he never disappoints. 
[03:15:00]  He's the greatest.  All it is is egg whites, right?  And oil.  Isn't that what makes mayonnaise?  I think that's about it.  Soybean oil.  Whole eggs.  Whole eggs.  Egg yolks.  Egg yolks.  Vinegar, salt, sugar, lemon juice.  And a few other little things.  It looks like you've never read this before.  Yeah.  He says he was reading it.  It's memorized.  Yeah.  All right.  Here it goes.  Those are the names of his children.  Number eight.  Little wine.  Sugar.  It looks like Clemenza. 
[03:15:30]  Here goes eight.  Uh-oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Eight wasn't good.  He just shuddered.  Eight wasn't good.  He just shuddered at the 720-calorie mark.  Have a sip of Gatorade.  Now, what was the...  It's better for you.  It'll actually replenish it.  What was the shudder about?  That little haul that you did?  I don't know.  That was his heart something.  That was his heart.  His heart just burped.  It's like when the vacuum sucks up a sock. 
[03:16:00]  Everything's going fine and then...  All right.  He's going for nine.  Thank God.  Here he goes.  He's starting to breathe that force.  Are you sweating?  No, but my stomach's gurgling a little bit.  Oh, is it?  Oh, yeah.  You're going to have the fucking explosive diarrhea.  I throw an extra hundred if you shit your pants in the studio. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, man.  That burp must have been horrible.  Here goes number nine in.  Oh, shoes look fatter.  Oh, he's got that one down.  He's got a piece of cake.  He's got all mayo around his mouth, though.  I know.  He's going like...  And it's all, like, mayo-y.  Sweet boy.  810 calories at the number nine mark.  He's making even 900 if he gets spoonful number 10 down.  These are not just tablespoons.  These are fucking massive tablespoons.  Yeah, he's way above that because there's only 60 tablespoons in this. 
[03:17:00]  How long walking to work off 900 calories?  Dude, that's...  How long of a walk is that, would you say?  That's, uh...  Let's see.  900 calories.  That's a couple hours.  That's, like, three hours easy.  Is it a three-hour walk?  Easy.  How come it's so much easier to put them on than to take them off?  I just don't get it.  Yep.  Iraq?  Number 10.  Here comes number 10.  This isn't accurate, though.  We've got to look at the jar and see how much he's... 
[03:17:30]  Someone's saying about two hours of walking.  Something would, uh, work off.  I'd say more, but...  Yeah, a little more.  You want to see how much he eats with both?  Yeah.  Wow.  How much is gone, Jimmy?  I would say about 30%.  We're down to here now.  It's making me nauseous just looking at it.  Yeah.  30% Iraq?  Yeah.  Isn't it amazing how, like, mayo's great in a small dose?  Yeah.  Some stuff is really good in a little small dose, but then the big heaping helpings like  that, disgusting. 
[03:18:00]  Like Cool Whip.  Yeah, I love Cool Whip.  Cool Whip is good in big, giant doses, though.  Do you like Cool Whip?  I do, but I can't eat that much of it.  No, you can take, like, a spoonful.  You can't eat...  You're eating mayonnaise, and you can't eat Cool Whip?  Oh, I couldn't eat, like, a container of Cool Whip.  I could.  I used to just take fucking...  Piggy Boy takes a fridge-y ride for this.  Here goes 10.  Big boy.  10 heaping spoonfuls of mayo. 
[03:18:30]  Wow.  Swap.  Iraq would need to walk 20 minute...  Oh, 8 20-minute miles.  That's an hour.  3 miles an hour.  So 8 20-minute miles in order to work off what he just ate.  Oh.  Now he's rinsing his mouth out with water.  Yeah.  There's a little rinse and spit.  Okay.  It's getting...  Now...  Very salty.  Very thick and...  If you're a third of the way done with the jar, that would be 1,800 calories.  Yeah.  Because didn't we say... 
[03:19:00]  It was 5,400.  5,400 for the entire...  So 1,800.  You might be taking more than a tablespoon.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, we're past that.  $100.  So did the jar.  Wait, you've already made $100 back.  Yeah.  Here goes heaping spoonful number 11.  Slipping out of my fingers.  Squeeze the jar, sweetie pie.  Yeah, you squeeze it.  No.  Oh, the spoon is slipping out of your fingers?  Get a little mayo on his knuckles.  Poor baby.  Out of his hooves. 
[03:19:30]  Here's number 11.  Here it is.  You can't do this?  You can.  It's just rough now.  11 is in.  This music is hysterical.  Well, it's 5,000.  Yeah, you're terrible. 
[03:20:00]  Iraq would need to walk 16 miles at 3 miles an hour.  Think you could do that after the mayo?  Do I look like I walk?  All right.  He's cleaning off the spoon.  He's going for teaspoon number 12.  That was really disgusting.  Here goes number 12.  Here it is.  Big number 12.  Wow, that is a heaping helping right there.  Just up to the tippity top of that spoon. 
[03:20:30]  All heaped over it in a big mountain of mayo.  Yeah.  You should eat it, and as you're swallowing it, spin it in a circle a few times.  Get the dizzies going.  Oh, God.  He's trying to...  Come on, suck it down.  You got it.  I got a wad of dog cum.  There it is.  Salty and sweet.  Number 12.  You don't want to squeeze.  He almost gagged.  Are you getting a gagging sensation?  He's starting to.  Yeah? 
[03:21:00]  Oh, that's a bigger spoon.  Look who it is.  Good idea.  Man of the Year outfit brings in sexually leaning against the window.  Hi, boys.  From Giant Queer Magazine.  Kenny, Kenny. 
[03:21:30]  Iraq might be done  Oh, Iraq, use the bigger spoon  Are you almost half done?  There he goes, he's gone to the bigger spoon  Yeah, where are you? He's tamping it down  I am  Just above half  Just above half, holy shit  Just above half  There's no way he's gonna be able to do this 
[03:22:00]  He's having a hard time getting the spoon down into the jar there  Here comes number 13  Oh, Cinco de Mayo  With Iraq earning his money  By eating an entire jar of Hellman's mayonnaise  Not that low-fat crap either  That's real mayo  In giant heaping tablespoonfuls  He's already up to, what is he up to?  This is number 13  Lucky 13  Here it is, a lot of calories, a lot of cholesterol 
[03:22:30]  Sodium, all this  All the stuff that's good for you  Oh, he's having a lot longer delay  From the spooning it up  To the putting it in his mouth  Segment  He gagged pretty heartily  During that last one  He's, uh  Shoving in there  13 saves  He's making the  Oh  Now the faces are a lot different  He's making the face  You're making the, like, the first  Oh  Wait, wait  Oh

[03:25:00]  But it basically looked like he was vomiting marshmallow food  Oh, God  You're on comment  How are you doing?  Oh, God  It's still in it  I think it's in his lungs  Sam, can you do me a favor?  Could you just get close  Just smell the garbage can  And smell how the garbage can smells  Ooh, there's red in there  What?  Oh, is that from the Gatorade?  Yeah, it's the Gatorade  That's purple  No, leave it there, Charlie  What did you have for breakfast?  I want Sam to smell the garbage can  And see if it's bad  I don't want to get near it

I had an oatmeal cranberry bar  Cranberry  That'll do it  Yeah, yeah  That's a little flex of cranberry in there  Yeah  The question is  Is he going to continue?  Of course he is  How is he going to continue?  It has to be asked  He knows he is  He just cleared out his system  He's got a fucking  Game on

[03:35:00]  Eating an entire jar of Hellman's mayonnaise  Here he goes  Wow, he's really  It's taken him a while  He puts that spoon about a foot away from his mouth  And just has to look at it  He has to psych himself up for it  Yep  He's got his hand up like he's burping  Wait, he just burped  Uh-oh  He looks like the indigestion guy  On TV  Indigestion  All right  Exactly  Way for Thin Mint

[03:37:00]  Sam won't watch him puke  He can't watch him  No, Sam can't watch  You're all right there, Iraq, right?  He's blowing mayo  I think Iraq's done a fantastic job  I think he's earned his keep  Yeah, I do  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's up to him  Ow  How you doing there, Iraq?  Wow, there's something dripping off the tip of his nose  He's dripping from everywhere 
[03:37:30]  Yeah  There's mayo coming out of his ears  Iraq  That hurt  He's collecting himself  The gurgling  Iraq, what does that feel like coming up?  Oh, it burns  It burns?  I'm sure there's a lot of stomach acid mixed in with the mayo  Yeah, yeah  Vinegar in it  It's very thick  Interesting note on that last one  Yeah 
[03:38:00]  I guess it was the big sounding one  It came out as a bubble  It popped as it left my mouth  It did sound very bubbly  Oh, he went back for the  Okay  He's just trying to spit it out  It's now lining his entire esophagus, I bet  Wow  That's tough  How much is left in there?  By the way  He's kicking this jar's ass  Yeah, he really is just kicking the jar of mayonnaise ass 
[03:38:30]  Is it up to the bottom of the label yet?  I think he's hitting the bottom with the spoon  We're right here  You're just about at the bottom of the  Almost to the bottom of the label  And then there's about an inch  An inch or so of jar left beneath the label  I would guess about ten spoonfuls left  He's done two-thirds of the bottle  Or the jar  The jar  I'm wearing that even  Wow  Holy fuck  E-Rock is a trooper  Sam has never done anything even close to this  True  See?  Now, E-Rock is actually getting kudos for this 
[03:39:00]  And Sam is looking like the asshole  That he is  See how people turn?  How many mouthfuls?  Could you take one mouthful of mayo?  Why?  I would be gagging and throwing up after  I mean, I wouldn't even be able to hit my lips  Before I started gagging and throwing up  One mouthful of mayo?  There's no way I could even hold it in my mouth  I'd be throwing up within a minute  Wow  For one mayo?  Yeah, yeah, yeah 
[03:39:30]  I can't even  E-Rock, are we done officially?  Let's talk to E-Rock  Is he done?  He's controlling this bit  I'll try for some more  Yeah!

No  He's puking it up  He's fine  Okay  As long as you puke it up  Yeah 
[03:40:30]  Basically he hasn't taken in any calories yet  Number 21  He's taking a lot of time  In between scooping the mayo  And putting it in his mouth  Have you noticed how  Remember that first spoonful? 
[03:41:00]  Went down so easily  21  Should do somersaults now  You have 21  Black Jack  Black Jack  He is really having a hard time  Putting these down now  Is it the taste, the texture  Or just the fact that  Your esophagus is inflamed now  That is making it difficult  Iroch  That and there's just a lot of salt  A lot of salt 
[03:41:30]  Salt is really making it burn  That's what makes it so tasty  On a nice turkey and American cheese sandwich  How bad do you not want mayo right now, Iroch?  I think I'm done with mayo  Yeah  I bet  Is he going for 22  Yeah  He says yeah  Okay  He says yeah  22  Gurgling was amazing  How many people have tuned out 
[03:42:00]  This sucks  Oh well  No  All right  He's  You're having a hard time  Getting the spoon down there  It's really getting low  And again  Hi Nicole  Nicole for the morning mashup  Horrified  No, I'm going to help you  I'm going to help you  Okay  This is a little trick I learned  Open up your throat  I don't know how to deep throat  Yeah, well you have to learn right now  Oh shit  And don't  Like, don't taste it  Don't let your tongue touch the roof of  Oh my god  Look at your eyes

[03:43:00]  Here he goes  There it is  Now he's  He's trying the technique of not tasting it  But  The trouble is  He can't swallow it very quickly now  Because he's  He's full  He can't just swallow it  Oh  Oh  There it is  Oh god  I tried  I tried  I tried  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh

[03:50:30]  After all that  That  Iraq is still down  $200  For just minding  His own business  Yesterday  Yeah  Minding his own business  He's out $500  Then we come up  With this thing  The Iraq Mayo Challenge 
[03:51:00]  Or whatever the fuck  You want to call it  And he only got  $300 out of the $500  Back after going  Through that hell  Trying to finish  A whole jar of mayonnaise  He's still not even even  No he's not even even  He's still $200 down  Let's say hi to  Pete  Now Pete is one of  Bret Michaels guys  Pete  Pete Evick right  Pete  Hey how are you buddy  How are you man  You're real close  To Bret Michaels  Aren't you  I would say so  I'm a guitar player  And tour manager  And you know 
[03:51:30]  We're pretty tight  Yeah and the reason  We got you on the phone  First of all  We're all friends  With Bret Michaels  We love when he comes in here  He's one of the nicest guys  We've ever had  On the Opie and Anthony show  And everyone is saying  That he's going to be  Making a full recovery  From this brain hemorrhage  That went down  About two weeks ago  And I'm hearing  Maybe that's not  The case  Pete  You know what  I would say  Let me just say  That if  Anybody can make  The full recovery  From it 
[03:52:00]  It'll be him  You guys know him  You've seen him  In the studio  You know  He's 110  All the time  The question  Is that  You know  The doctors  Have let  Have made all  These statements  About how great  He's recovering  And the truth  Be told  All the medical tests  Say that  He's recovering  But when you know  The guy  Even you guys  Who've seen him  In the studio  If you saw him  Today  You would know  That he's not  You know  He's not  Back to 100% 
[03:52:30]  You know  He's not the man  That you know  He's not the man  That I know  And so the doctors  You know  The doctors  Are talking about  Health  By the way  The machines  Are talking  And all the tests  And all the different  Things show that  His body  Is going to recover  But they just  Don't know  The guy  That we all know  What differences  Are you noticing  Well first of all  Just to slow you down  A little bit  They didn't say  He's made a full  Recovery yet  They said he's going to  It's going to take  Another couple weeks  I believe 
[03:53:00]  Right  Yeah  And there's such  A lot of information  That's the thing  None of us  Have said anything yet  Until at least  All that information  The technical information  Because there's so many  Things that you have  To keep in the  Consideration  I think everybody  Has already forgotten  That two weeks ago  He had an apodectomy  And he's still  Recovering from that  But that's a  Four to six weeks process  On top of that  He's a juvenile diabetic  Most people  At 47  That's a juvenile diabetic 
[03:53:30]  Have already lost their foot  Or lost their eyesight  Or something like that  So you know  His immune system  Is kicking in  To fix his apodectomy  And now  It's got to deal  With this brain hemorrhage  There's a lot going on  Right  And now  To Jimmy's question  Which is a very good one  What are the changes  You're obviously seeing  In Bret Michaels right now  You know  Like I said  He's 110%  120%  You know  When he comes to New York  To see you guys  I've been with him  A few times  I've been there  And see you guys 
[03:54:00]  And his full day  Is packed  He comes in  He'll talk to you guys  We'll wake up  At 5 o'clock in the morning  And we'll be going  Until you know  Midnight  When he's doing  You know  The late night TV shows  And all these different things  And right now  It's really weird  To see him  Have to  You know  Just pace himself  And do something  You know  He'll talk for a few minutes  And then he'll just  Just talking  Will exhaust him  Just saying something  And just walking  To the bathroom  Will wipe him out  And he has to  Rebuild his energy  For a couple of next thing 
[03:54:30]  You know  Is he speaking the same  Is his speech the same  Or is he slowed down  Is talking a little bit  Yeah  It's slow right now  It's more slow  And thought out  You know  He's  There are moments  Where you get  The normal witty  And quick spoken  Bret Michaels  And then there are moments  Where you get  A slower  Kind of just  Thinking about  What's going on around him  And not even sure  That he heard  What you said  How about the thought process  Have you  Do you think 
[03:55:00]  The thought process  Is the same  And the body  Is just a little tired  Or have you  Does it seem to take  Longer to process thoughts  You know what  I don't know  That  That's interesting  That you say that  I believe  That his brain  Is actually running  Inside  100%  Like it always does  110  120%  And I believe  To be honest with you  That's why they let him  Go to a rehab  Center  Instead of keeping  In the hospital  Right now  Is  I think 
[03:55:30]  It's the same  Scenario  As when a cow  You know  The sea world  Has never been able  To keep a great  White shark  In captivity  Even though you  Provide it  With all the things  You need  It just dies  I think that  Bret was  You know  Dying in that room  Because his brain  Was running  And it's almost  His will to live  Is what's going  To keep him alive  The more he's  Sitting there  Hooking to that  Machinery  With the only thing  Working but his brain  I think that  That was starting  To do more damage  Than good  And I also think  That let's be honest  With you  I know for a fact 
[03:56:00]  That he  He went into a place  That 95%  Of the people  Don't come out of  And he saw people  That were there  Before him  And after him  Not make it through  And that was really  Starting to affect his brain  I think that was  You know  There's a moment  In Bret's life  I believe  That happened  Where he kind of  I'm not going to say  It was depression  But I believe  He kind of went  Geez man  All these things  Have always happened  To me in my life  Why I'm on the lucky one  Because there were people  Not making it around him  And I think that  All that stuff 
[03:56:30]  Was on his brain  And I think his brain  Is 110%  Like always  Sure  But a lot of people  Amazed at it  The doctor said  He's going to make  A full recovery  Do you believe  He's going to make  A full recovery  Pete?  Whew  You know  I just have to say  That if anybody can  It's Bret  You know  We found out  To be honest with you  We found out  After some of these  Surgeries  And some of these  MRIs and stuff  That the Tony's thing  If the Tony's thing  Would have hit him  A little bit differently  It would have killed him 
[03:57:00]  On the spot  We found that out  The epidectomy  Was a serious situation  We're starting to believe  That he's a miracle man  Because even his car crash  In 94  And the Madison Square Garden  Accident  He's cheated death  A whole lot of times  That we don't think about  That we started to add up  And I believe  That if anybody can  He can  I will tell you  That the doctors  Were blown away  At his health  Especially for a juvenile  Diabetic  For a 47 year old man  Who's not a professional athlete  They said they've never 
[03:57:30]  Seen anything like that  And I heard him  Say that myself  Is what they're telling  The public  A little different  Than what you're seeing  I didn't see  A full press conference  Yesterday  But I will say  That I see  My best friend  Hurting a lot  Right now  Yeah  A lot  A lot  I see  You know  It's weird  He explains  A headache  That we're told  Can last 
[03:58:00]  Three to six months  No  Can you imagine  Can you imagine  Having  And it's a migraine  Or more  Pain  A more painful  Than a migraine  Than a headache  Can you imagine  For three to six months  Just having that  Of course not  No  Jesus  My three are divorced  And then to be honest  With you  The thing  That we're describing  The reason nobody  Close to him  Talked yet  Is because the doctors  Are talking  Some crazy stuff  I can't even comprehend  But the blood  That leaked 
[03:58:30]  Now has to be  Reingested  Into his system  And it goes  Down his spine  And he has a pain  In his back  And his lower  Body  That he says  He's never felt  Anything like that  And sometimes that pain  Oversees the headache  Pain  So that's his description  That explains anything to you  Jesus  So it's going to be a while  Before he's out  And about again  Yeah but you know what  I'll be honest with you 
[03:59:00]  He's determined  He is full on determined  You know  Nobody's going to jeopardize himself  Not him  Not us  You know  His family  Today is Georgia  His youngest daughter's birthday  And family  And stuff like that  Means something different  To him now  Family was always  Absolutely important to him  But you can see it  In his eyes  When he sees his face  Right now  That he's lucky  He sees them  You can see that  You know what I mean  Yeah and physically  How does he look  Does he look really  Drained and tired  And out of it 
[03:59:30]  Yeah  That's what I'm saying  There are moments  Where he looks like  He's ready to take on the world  It just lasts a very short time  It'll be like 5 or 10 minutes  And then all of a sudden  He's back out  Right  And you never see that with him  You never  That guy is up before everybody  And then that's everybody  And going 110  You know  But I'll tell you this  Again  Nobody is going to pressure him  To do anything  But the right thing  Nobody is telling him  To get back on tour  Nobody's doing anything  But Leonard Skinner 
[04:00:00]  Is one of his favorite bands  Of all time  And we were the solo band  We were supposed to be  Going on tour with Skinner  This summer  Sure  And I think that  I think that that  Is going to drive him  To recover  I just don't think  That in his soul  He can miss that  So you're thinking  He's going to make the tour  With Leonard Skinner  This summer  That's pretty amazing  And he's in a tough spot  Because he won  Celebrity Apprentice  And he can't go out  And promote that  Right  Now we were right 
[04:00:30]  In the middle of a tour  And every show  Had been sold out  And he was happier  He'd never been  With the success  Of the solo stuff  And the song  With Miley Cyrus  And everything was just  Everything was just  Going absolutely wonderful  And that advectomy hit  Sure  Down in Texas  Is Donald Trump frustrated  Knowing that he won  Celebrity Apprentice  And he's not available  For press?  Well  I don't know  Jesus  Trump's a scumbag  Jesus  What?  You mean he won  Last week?  Well  I've heard he won 
[04:01:00]  The whole thing  Pete  I know he gets  Real real real closely  And Donald has sent  A lot of personal wishes  And said a lot of  Really nice things  Brett is  Brett is scheduled  To be in the finale  And they said that  Publicly on TV  We don't  We were just trying  To get you to slip  We don't  We don't have the answers  Yeah sure  Pete  I have an off the subject question  Yeah  What phone service do you have?  Because I know  We have a very rough connection  Oh it's AT&T 
[04:01:30]  Of course it is  I just figured  I heard a bad phone connection  And it must be  That despicable AT&T  The most important phone call  Of the day for us  And it has to be AT&T  Alright listen Pete  To summarize  A lot of  A lot of Brett Michaels  Fans  Are very concerned  So why don't you  Why don't you speak  To the fans right now  You know  Something  Something that  Could give him  I guess a little hope  Or what not  Oh um 
[04:02:00]  Well  No you didn't  Look  I didn't even see  You know what  You could be  What the  No it's the fucking  AT&T  Like Jimmy was saying  Holy shit  I completely  Didn't see that coming  What the phone  Man  Fucking phone man  AT&T  God their service sucks  Oh my god 
[04:02:30]  Oh my god  That was so  Fucking uncomfortable  Jimmy did you say  AT&T has bad  Fucking phone service  This is so  Fucking bad  So fucking bad  Oh wow  The whole time  It's going in and out  I'm like  I guarantee  He has an iPhone  Oh really  Or AT&T Blackberry  Really  Well that's  I don't know 
[04:03:00]  I don't know  What to think of that  I know  Maybe they're painting  A better picture  But again  If you know somebody  Maybe the doctors  See the physical  And know he's gonna recover  And this guy just  Knows him  And in this process  Is seeing that he's not  Yeah  I'm saying nothing  His mouth is just opening  And garbage is pouring out of it  Is there anything worse  When you start something  You know you're saying nothing  But you know you gotta  At least  Fucking make it look good  You gotta at least try  To follow through on it  Right  At least maybe a good  Follow through will fix this  Nope 
[04:03:30]  I like how Jimmy  Is brought to the show  Now just say  Oh holy shit  I'm saying nothing  I'm just saying nothing  I like when I start  Saying something  And I actually had a thought  And then  You just forget  What you wanted to say  And you're trying  To keep talking  While you're trying  To remember  To hold their attention  And you have nothing  Nothing  Yeah  Happens  Oh Celebrity Apprentice  The finale is always live  So you don't even know  Oh it's live  Going into it  Okay I'm sorry  Assholes  Alright 
[04:04:00]  Yeah let's  Well we wish nothing  But the best for Bret Michaels  Sure  I gotta be here  Till about 11.30  Doing reads  So I guess we have to  Take off  Yeah  Yeah  I would  Well let's not forget  You're gonna be on Hannity tonight  Hannity  Right  Yes Steve  Oh  And Jimmy  Friday morning  July 2nd and 3rd  Tickets to Borgata  Go on sale  10am  Those shows sold out  Very quickly in January  And it's their busy weekend  So  Yeah  I'll be down at the Borgata
