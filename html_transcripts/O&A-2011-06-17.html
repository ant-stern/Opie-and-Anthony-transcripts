<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussing their quiet Friday office due to summer vacations.  Anthony recounts a terrible cab ride, complaining about the driver's navigation and lack of air conditioning, sparking a humorous discussion about cab driver body odor. Norton details his successful Chicago show, marred only by a scheduling error and microphone issues. This leads to a lengthy critique of their SiriusXM workspace, contrasting their cramped office with the lavish facilities of Harpo Studios, where Norton received a tour from former colleague Elo.  They express resentment over perceived unfair treatment compared to other employees, particularly the Lady Gaga management team's inaccessibility versus Elo's influence at Oprah's company.

The show extensively discusses Elo's departure from SiriusXM and his current success, emphasizing their continued friendly relationship.  Norton recounts Elo's help in securing a photo with Lady Gaga.  They repeatedly contrast Elo's supportive nature with their current management's perceived lack of support and appreciation. Norton also addresses a problem with former colleague Steve Carlesi, who continues to host their old videos and photos online, demanding their removal.  Further complaints focus on SiriusXM's poor treatment of talented employees, leading to their departures due to inadequate raises.  A specific instance of a talented behind-the-scenes person leaving is mentioned.

The discussion then shifts to Anthony Weiner's resignation, focusing on Benji from the Howard Stern Show interrupting Weiner's press conference with shouts of "Goodbye, pervert!"  The hosts criticize Weiner's handling of the situation and express strong dislike for Gloria Allred's opportunistic involvement.  The segment ends with renewed complaints about SiriusXM, again contrasting their current treatment with their positive experiences working with Elo.

A significant portion of the show delves into the Casey Anthony trial, with the hosts and callers debating the evidence and likelihood of a conviction.  Casey Anthony's courtroom demeanor, especially her laughter, is heavily discussed.  The hosts speculate on potential lesser charges and engage in crude humor. A caller's desire to become pen pals with Casey Anthony prompts humorous and sexually suggestive banter.  The segment also touches upon Eliot Spitzer's post-scandal career, mocks a politician's thank-you speech, features the "F.U. Line" segment, mentions the Vancouver Stanley Cup riot, includes a call from comedian Billy the Bassman promoting his new CD, and discusses Sully Erna's (Godsmack) solo show and a surprise song he created for Jim Norton, "Good Boy Phone/Naughty Boy Phone".  They also discuss Robert Kelly's iOS 5 data loss issues.  Mayor Tom Menino's speech about the Bruins' Stanley Cup win is played and commented upon. Billy the Bassman and Sully Erna are mentioned as guests (Sully via recording).

The show continues with a discussion about a bizarrely dressed man, transitioning to promoting Bobo's stand-up show and a video of Heather Hite.  "BoboComp," a new segment featuring Bobo, is teased.  Stephen Wright's upcoming guest appearance is announced.  A sexually suggestive "Uncle Paul" bit is played, followed by Sully Erna's "Good Boy Phone/Naughty Boy Phone" recording.  Microphone problems are discussed, transitioning into a graphic and offensive conversation about child molestation within the Hispanic community, sparked by staff member Mars and a caller, Julia from Cape Cod.  Mars and others share personal experiences of childhood sexual abuse, leading to a vulgar discussion of sexual behavior and preferences. A caller details child molestation within their family.

Stephen Wright then joins the show.  The conversation focuses on his career, appearances on Johnny Carson's show, and germophobia.  He discusses his Oscar win and role in *Reservoir Dogs*.

The conversation with Stephen Wright continues, focusing on their early stand-up experiences (including Wright's disastrous Scampi's gig and Opie's bombing at Rascals), career choices and regrets, and personal anecdotes (including graphic details of Opie's sexual encounters).  Wright discusses his comedic style and influences. His upcoming Newport Yachting Center performance is promoted. The show ends with the debut of the "Bobo Cop" segment, featuring crude and sexually suggestive humor.

A final segment discusses Nancy Pelosi and other politicians' reactions to Anthony Weiner's activities, perceived political hypocrisy, and the hosts' reluctance to end the show early. A "Tip O'Neill" pronunciation bit is included.  A lengthy post-show segment with Garrett, Eric, and Troy features complaints about management, detailing a prank involving a "free puppies" box containing pornography and a dildo.  This led to a listener-driven email campaign sending penis pictures to management.  Garrett shares anecdotes about the work environment and relationships with other personalities, including Jay Thomas and Ira. Bobo's stand-up performance and the "BoboCop" production, featuring Ice-T, are discussed. Louis C.K. was present during this segment.  The discussion includes numerous vulgar and sexually explicit terms.  The mention of Chachara, Thomas, and Bergeronâ€™s appearance at the NHL store is included.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Anthony show right here on Sirius XM satellite radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're good.  That's America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Fucking Friday.  Yes, it is.  The only people that have not figured out how to not work on Fridays.  How to get Fridays off, I know.  Because now, it's contagious around here.  No one comes in on Fridays.  No.  Especially in the summertime. 
[00:04:30]  No.  Oh, the bosses think the place is running so well, they're like, ah, why don't we just take Fridays off in the summer?  The weekends are now Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  That is a serious, we call it a serious weekend.  And it is serious.  This shit's going to end.  I'm telling you right the fuck now.  One way or another.  This shit is going to end.  It is quite stunning.  It's amazing that we're the only ones here.  Yeah.  This shit is going to end. 
[00:05:00]  Putting on a live show.  We still got some time before it ends, but this shit will end.  It'll have to change or it's going to end.  Fuck this.  That's how I start today.  Morning, Jim Norton.  Jimmy.  Fucking Cammy went the wrong way.  You're right.  What?  What happened?  I'm so annoyed.  They are the worst.  You know, we come down fucking, you come down Broadway, you make a left on 48th Street,  and then you come up. 
[00:05:30]  I look up, I'm fucking listening to Motorhead.  I look up, we're at like 42nd Street.  I'm like, what are you doing?  I actually feel like a fucking, a black movie take.  I'm like, what are you doing?  42nd Street.  I make turn.  But instead of making the left and then heading over to 6th and going up, this asshole goes,  oh, he panics.  And he fucking makes a right.  And then takes me to 8th Avenue and all the way back.  Oh my God.  No way.  Fucking up, up, and then he cut across.  So whatever.  I'm just annoyed.  All right.  Well.  I make turn.  He shut the meter off immediately.  I'm such a faggot. 
[00:06:00]  I still tipped him.  I give him a dollar.  Well, he just panicked.  He's probably on his 23rd hour of driving that stupid cab.  He should have this grid embedded in his brain.  These guys do 16.  Autopilot.  They do 16 to 18 hour shifts, go home, sleep four hours, and then they're back doing their  16 to 18 hour shifts.  Yeah.  God knows.  I was going to say, God knows they don't fucking shower in between.  I got in a cab the other day.  Wow.  Wowee.  Just.  But you know what?  Their stink all smells the same. 
[00:06:30]  Isn't that odd?  That's just B.O. in general.  Yeah.  I think it's just B.O. in general.  You would think there'd be a little hint like, ah, that's more like a Pakistani guy  hasn't showered.  Mm-hmm.  Well, that's all.  Wow.  That's heavy Greek.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Or something like that.  Greek.  Greek.  Greek.  But, uh, boy, that, uh, that body stench really unites us as a people.  Well, it doesn't help that it's summertime and these guys don't want to use their A.C.  unless the passenger asks for it.  Too much gas.  So they'd sit in their own sweat for 16 straight hours. 
[00:07:00]  Burn gas.  No burn gas.  Dude, I hate that when you're pulling in somewhere and the air's on and they put the meter off  and they turn the air off.  Yeah.  It's like, I, I, how much do you think you're saving?  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sick of the gas air conditioning thing.  Yeah.  Fucking relax.  Maybe back when there was this giant compressor in your old fucking Ford from the 50s, it might  have cut back on your fuel economy.  Nowadays, the air conditioner is not cutting down on your fucking fuel.  Not so much. 
[00:07:30]  Don't worry about it.  Not so much.  All right.  We're all settled then.  Everyone's good.  Oh, please.  Timmy, how was Chicago?  It was great.  It was, it was actually, uh, the crowd was fucking great.  And, uh, you know, I was, I have a minor annoyance because I was told we were the only show opening  night of the festival.  That's why we agreed to do a Wednesday.  Oh boy.  And of course they, Rodney Carrington and Ron White were also, uh, and I love Ron White.  I think it's great.  Um, we're at a theater.  It was a little while away, but it was still a Wednesday night.  So I, that's the only irritation I had was that we kind of, it kind of promised you that 
[00:08:00]  you wouldn't be the only show.  Of course I would never, we wouldn't have taken a Wednesday if not.  But anyway, the Chicago theater was great.  Crowd was phenomenal.  Uh, the sound people there could have been better.  I walk out.  There's no mic.  I'm actually screaming.  I'm holding the mic.  I guess there's about 2,600 people there.  Um, and I'm screaming and no one can hear me.  And so I just, I just look at the sound guy and I'm yelling, turn the fucking mic up.  That's how, that's how I opened my set.  Cause we all have, dude, we, we all have the microphone because we walk on and off with 
[00:08:30]  our mics.  It's just, it's, it saves battery life and you know, at the end, we all need them to  go out together.  When, when you started comedy some 20 years ago, did you think fast forward 20 years,  you'd be yelling, turn my fucking mic on at a theater show in Chicago.  I figured you'd be past that.  Right.  I figured you'd yell it once and it would be on.  I didn't think that I would actually be looking back at the sound guy, like profile, you're  the audience.  Turn the fucking mic on.  Turn the fucking mic.  I was screaming probably 20 to 30 seconds before the mic actually went on. 
[00:09:00]  Cause I think he was trying all four.  He just panicked as well.  He was just a panicky.  Oh my God.  There are just some people that can't take a little bit of pressure.  Well, you got to use the unions, you know, uh, and I knew what it was, uh, when I was  walking out, uh, I, I, I felt there was, we had a guy, a local guy go up and do five  minutes before I went on.  And, uh, he's like, all right, are you guys ready?  And the guy's sitting, he's not handing me one of the mics.  I'm like, you got to give me one of the fucking, I think the sound guy had walked away  for his post.  So he left some other guy holding the bag. 
[00:09:30]  So whatever.  But Chicago itself was great.  I, I, I, I, I want to go up there.  And the show was great.  Have you never been?  Never been.  That's fucking an amazing city, dude.  Yeah, I know.  Chicago is so great.  I know.  I hear things.  You've never been there.  I hear things.  I want to go.  Me neither.  Aesthetically, Trump's got a building.  It's almost as big as the Hancock, which is a hundred stories.  The fucking city.  It's massive metropolitan.  We're kind of mad at you.  Why?  Because if it was a Friday show, we would have taken today off.  We all would have enjoyed Chicago.  Oh, but you had a, you had to book a show in the middle of the fucking week. 
[00:10:00]  How do we work that one out?  Let's, let's, uh, then they were all mad at the festival because had they told us the  truth, you can bet I'd be fucking, I would have left yesterday to get to Chicago today.  You would have been Freddy Friday.  I would have been fucking Freddy Friday and I would have been Stu Saturday coming home.  We all would have been enjoying some fucking steak in Chicago instead of doing this show  today.  Yeah.  I, uh, I had salmon when I was there, but the food there was amazing.  I got excited when you booked that.  And I'm like, okay, I'm finally going to see Chicago.  And then I looked at your schedule.  It's Wednesday night.  You should go take a weekend there just to do it, man.  There's a, the Trump's got a brand new hotel kind of residence place. 
[00:10:30]  It's, you can't not be in awe.  Say what you want about Trump.  The man's a boob, but God damn, could he make a building?  Yeah.  That son of a bitch who can put a building up.  Is it the second tallest building in Chicago?  I think so.  Probably behind this year's tower.  Sure.  No one, no one's being the Sears Tower.  That is beautiful.  That's crazy.  That's the Trump building.  Let me see.  That's pretty fucking high.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a hotel, right?  Kenny, it's a hotel residence.  Half hotel, yeah.  Half residence.  It's fucking gorgeous.  But you just go there for the weekend, eat, maybe, you know, walk around. 
[00:11:00]  You'd love Chicago.  Yeah.  Kenny gave me, you know, the lowdown.  It's great.  Meaning he gave me nothing on the way in today.  Yeah, no.  How was the show in Chicago?  It was good.  What did you guys do?  I saw you low.  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  And got a tour of Harpo.  Exactly.  That was me waiting for more information.  I actually forgot about Harpo until you just...  This is...  By the way, how do you forget about, like, getting a tour of Harpo? 
[00:11:30]  That's kind of cool.  The answer would be, I'm an ass.  I literally forgot.  Until you said that, I forgot.  Oh, look at that.  That's on Oprah's stage.  We, um...  Yes.  This is why Elo is the fucking...  Did they show you the girders underneath it?  We used to work with that guy?  Dude, how happy and healthy is Elo?  I don't know who that is.  Who is that guy?  I don't know who it is.  Can you turn the screen a little bit on one?  It's not Elo.  He...  I don't know who that is.  Does he look good, man?  Look at his sparkling white teeth.  He's like Prince Charming. 
[00:12:00]  Who is he?  He looks like a Prince Charming.  Do you...  You weigh more than Elo.  I know.  Absolutely I do.  Elo, you're not a big guy.  No.  Elo used to kind of be, uh...  I'm about 160.  You know.  Kind of a fat, bloated drunk.  He was kind of bloated.  He was bloated.  Who is that guy?  Dude, he's...  He looks like a metrosexual...  Why are we taking his cue and getting the fuck out of here?  Oh, my God.  We could add 10 to 15 years onto what we look like.  Talk about the healthy rat that left the sinking ship. 
[00:12:30]  He looks 10 years younger, doesn't he?  Oh, at least.  I'll tell you something.  And if he ever says he misses us or this place...  He's lying.  Spit in his face.  Because he's lying.  He's lying.  Yeah, I finally figured out he's lying because he doesn't really...  Living the good life.  We don't really, you know, communicate as much as we used to.  He politely writes me back now.  That's what our relationship is.  Is he living la bella vita?  I think he loves us.  I really do.  Oh, I have no doubt he'll always love us, but it goes to the point you just made. 
[00:13:00]  He doesn't miss us or this place.  So now it's a polite, you know, friendship.  Yeah.  It used to be a lot of begging emails and text messages for me.  Yeah.  And now it's just like, hey, man, yeah, if you get to Chicago, I'd love to see you.  He wrote me back immediately.  He goes, hey, man, why don't you come?  Because he was going to come to the show, but Oprah was in town and they had a dinner plan.  So he didn't know we could.  So he goes, why don't you come by and say hello?  That must be a chore to plan.  Did he have to throw that in the conversation? 
[00:13:30]  I got something that I'm doing with Oprah.  Sorry.  He wasn't name-dropped because he had promised to come to the show.  He's like, yeah, I'll definitely come.  Because after Lady Gaga had debacle last time, I had been talking to Elo after people here  told me I couldn't take a photo with her.  And this is why I love Eric.  I get there.  He's, you know, he's the fucking president.  He runs 15 of her companies.  And she's not there when I'm there.  She's coming in a little bit later because they have stuff in the afternoon.  So his office is literally next to Oprah's.  It's where shade is to us. 
[00:14:00]  It's like that.  It's, it's, it's, it's.  That makes sense, too.  We walk by.  There's a giant office.  He goes, there's the boss's office.  We didn't stop and linger.  We just kept going.  Yeah.  But it is, it's like a giant living room.  Palatial.  Yeah.  Palatial is a good word.  Yeah.  I see her office on TV.  Oh, they show.  They have it.  Yeah.  The reality show, whatever it's called.  Yeah.  They show Oprah's office.  It's a living room.  Yeah.  It's beautiful.  The whole soul facility is beautiful.  We got a nice office in it that we share.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Where is that? 
[00:14:30]  It's the same office Fonzie used.  And I go, because that's what, you know, they think of us.  We have a tiny little office that was supposed to be temporary.  Remember?  Yeah.  The studio was supposed to be temporary.  Our office space was supposed to be temporary until they figured out.  Two years later, nothing new.  I liked how they were talking when we first got here about how we'll have an office.  And yeah, the rest of the guys will be in there because it'll be a nice atmosphere that  we could all, you just see like when Sam and Danny are in there, it looks like crowded. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  You can't, you know, there's no sitting anywhere and kicking your feet up.  And no, I gave up on my, uh, my desk, my computer and a chair just so those guys would  have more room.  I gave it up like France to the Nazis.  Yeah.  I don't even, I didn't even give a shit.  We officially don't have an office because we felt like, okay, if we give up our seats  in our little space in that area, that these guys might have room to work.  Which I like though.  No place to, uh, no excuse to go there after the show.  10 o'clock.  Goodbye.  We're just fucking better. 
[00:15:30]  That's okay.  Please.  I'm here with you every day.  I get it.  But I do want to say this because people get confused out there.  I love doing radio.  I still love doing radio with Anthony and Jim.  Oh, it's great.  But this fucking place.  It's fucking great.  Well, it's just, it's a difference in the way people treat you.  It's like, literally he, he takes me, he walks us around, he's showing us the basement  and there's pictures of, uh.  That's our office.  Yeah.  It's a visual, but there you go.  That's, that's what they think of us.  We have, we have to push the chair kind of in the, in the hall so we can have a meeting 
[00:16:00]  in there.  I don't even know what that is.  I have not been in there or seen it in years.  Is that my space?  I don't even know.  Like, what are we looking at?  We're actually, we're looking at for everyone out there, a very tiny office.  You could, you know how people exaggerate where you, you could put your arms, like spread  them out and you could touch the walls.  Yeah.  I think you could do that in this office.  That is actually.  You could at least hit the cabinet.  A dual purpose area.  That is the Opie and Anthony office slash. 
[00:16:30]  Where guests sit.  Celebrity green room.  That's fucking embarrassing.  That, by the way, that is where guests sit when they come in.  Oh God.  This is what they think of us right there.  That's embarrassing.  That's fucking embarrassing.  That's exactly what they think of us.  They took us away from a beautiful facility promising us that we would be very happy over  here, you know, but just bear with us, you know, until we figured out, we got a couple  little offices we're going to throw you in and a little studio, but bear with us.  What was Paul Castellano laying down on the carpet? 
[00:17:00]  What the fuck?  Look at that.  I don't know.  Disgusting.  Yes, it is.  Big stain.  Well, that's actually located inside the sex cave, which is the sex cave.  The sex cave.  The sex cave.  Nagle's office.  That's our green room?  That's where we put our guests, right?  Yeah.  That's great.  It's embarrassing.  Is there another fucking green room or is it just Howard's?  I think we could use it or Howard's.  I don't know if we can use it when he's got a guest in there, though.  Yeah.  How about when he's not here?  Because now he's a part-timer.  Can we use some of his stuff?  There is one public SiriusXM green room. 
[00:17:30]  Not public meaning for the whole company.  Right.  So sometimes we have access to it, sometimes not.  Anyway, so the difference.  So you go to Harpo, Lady Gaga.  Where were you at, Jimmy?  Well, I have been kept in touch with ELO since Lady Gaga.  Because you want a picture with Lady Gaga.  I do.  And you should have had your picture with Lady Gaga.  It would have worked out that day, yeah, because Eric could have walked me right up to Gail.  But it should have worked out here.  Sure.  Of course.  I don't expect to be taken care of here.  But I don't expect to necessarily be taken care of.  But you don't expect to be blocked and kind of hampered either. 
[00:18:00]  You don't expect to be treated like a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Basically.  Let's be honest with you.  Yeah.  Let's be honest with each other.  So you go down to the basement and he takes us, he shows us where the, oh, that's when Oprah took us away for two weeks.  And literally, fucking Oprah, you can't not like this woman.  There's nothing but pictures on cruise ships of her entire staff.  She flew 1,500 fucking people.  She rented planes and boats.  To seesaw with? 
[00:18:30]  They won't stop, Jimmy.  Jimmy's being so nice.  He's got such a great tour.  He's got a good story.  I know.  It's making me laugh.  But there's pictures of the cruises. 
[00:19:00]  And, oh, my God.  And it's just a great vibe.  And then he takes me into where she did her show.  And we sit on the stage.  And I walk out where the fucking, where she did like her big walkout with the Oprah sign.  Yeah.  And then we go up to Elo's office.  We talk for about 40 minutes.  And I was mentioning the Lady Gaga thing to him.  He goes, oh, yeah, by the way, I called her manager for you.  He goes, it's done.  The next time you're around where she's going to be, the manager knows. 
[00:19:30]  Take care of.  So the next time I'm anywhere Lady Gaga will be, this is the juice Eric Logan has.  He just calls.  Holy shit.  He calls Lady Gaga's manager.  And he goes, hey, listen, I had somebody that needed to be taken care of last time and wasn't.  He goes, oh, yeah, yeah, she was tired.  Look, the guy didn't know what happened.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes, Elo goes,  no, no, no problem.  But if you could do me a favor the next time she's around.  And I'm like, thank you.  So whenever she's in the same area I am, or if it's the Bogota or whatever, I will hopefully do it.  You could just go, out of the way, everybody. 
[00:20:00]  I have permission.  So the company you currently work for, Sirius XM, could have done the right thing.  Of course.  Lady Gaga was a mere, I don't know, yards away from you.  And you were shooed away.  Shooed away.  Not only were you told not to get a picture, you were shooed away like a whatever.  Yeah.  Add whatever you want there.  And now Eric Logan, who, because he does give a shit about us still, is doing the right thing and getting you a lady.  He's a friend.  He's an honest friend.  He's a great guy.  But Oprah was not there when I was there. 
[00:20:30]  So look what Elo had sent over to the fucking hotel.  Oprah signed a picture for you.  Yeah, she said he got her to sign an 8x10 for me.  Jesus.  It says, Jimmy, many thanks and blessings.  Love Oprah Winfrey.  Wow.  He has that sent over to the hotel.  See, that's...  In a fucking thing.  What a great dude, man.  Yeah, why do you got to work for a place where they have to fucking knock you down and keep you down the entire fucking time?  God, it's just...  The little things like this goes a long way.  He's still my friend. 
[00:21:00]  How long has it been since he was here?  I was trying to figure out the other day.  I think we're up to three years.  He's still a guy I keep in touch with.  He's still a guy I like.  I think it's about three years right around now.  I didn't plan on Tornhawk.  I wanted him just to come to the show and maybe have dinner.  Yeah.  He invited me.  But he's a real dude.  He's a real...  And that's why he is where he's at.  What a great guy.  He's a great guy.  Does that make sense?  Yes.  That's why he is where he's at.  You can't even sit there and go like, yeah, fuck him.  He left and he gets this great gig.  What a...  Like, he deserves everything he has.  Everything he gets.  Yeah.  Everything he gets. 
[00:21:30]  And he moved up in that company.  And it's funny.  Then he was telling me...  This is what happens when your boss takes care of you.  He was telling me how...  Because he showed me pictures.  And there's one of the Jeter picture that I have in my house.  He has in his house from that night we went to the XM thing.  Oh, yeah.  I got that in my house, too, man.  And he has a bunch of Yankee stuff on the wall.  Really cool pictures with Rivera and stuff like that.  And then he takes me to this conference.  He goes, oh, here's one.  You're going to like it.  He opens his iPhone.  And it's Oprah and Eric.  Eric is co-president.  It's him and a woman of the president of Oprah's conference.  Sherry, yes. 
[00:22:00]  She's very talented, by the way.  Yes.  Those two, Oprah and Barack and Michelle Obama.  And he tells me how when Barack did...  Barack Obama did her show, he had the Secret Service, how everything was a no-move zone.  Even his office he couldn't go into.  Wow.  There's a guy with a weapon.  He's like, I got it.  Because it's next to her.  You can't fuck her out.  But he says that Oprah is looking for him.  He says he hears her calling, Elo.  Where's Elo?  And then she brings him past Secret Service. 
[00:22:30]  That's, by the way, the juice Oprah has.  She moves the Secret Service away.  Get out of the way.  To bring that little creepy gnome into the area.  And she makes sure that he meets Michelle and President Obama and says, Mr. President, this  is my president of my company.  Like, that's how she treated the guy who worked for her.  Wow.  She's the greatest.  I mean, you can't not like Oprah.  You have to see how happy he is at that place.  God damn.  I wish she liked filthy, gullet, no gullet comedians.  I really have nothing to offer the Oprah channel. 
[00:23:00]  If Elo would have went to a guy place, we would have been long gone.  Spike, anywhere.  Anywhere.  I would have gave Mike two weeks in a fucking heartbeat.  But he picked a female organization.  A place we can never, ever go for a big.  On purpose.  He went someplace we couldn't follow him.  Yeah.  He knew.  He went down a one-way street and he knew we were at the corner waving at him.  I don't blame him.  Instead of Elo, we got a guy now that wants us to go to Times Square with fucking wireless mics. 
[00:23:30]  That sounds great.  Like we're a morning zoo show from Idaho.  That sounds great.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was good seeing him.  I forgot all about the Harper tour.  And the bitterness comes from the fact that we were promised a lot and none of it has come true.  None of it.  You see our office.  Look at that.  Take a look at it.  Oh, please.  That's what they think of us.  We have to move the fucking one chair so guests could sit down in that crowded little corner  and wait to come on our show.  Horrible old recliner with the big wooden stick shift on the side. 
[00:24:00]  That's what guests have to sit in.  My grandpa farted his last farts into that watching the Mets when the fucking Seaver was still playing.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You know what?  The haters are right.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what else to do, man.  I don't know what else to do.  This is so frustrating.  Is that 57th Street XM Studio furniture?  They just dragged it over here as prisoners, as like a booty from a bounty from their victory over XM. 
[00:24:30]  They were able to take people.  Weren't we paraded back here in chains?  But we might get interns, you know, in another few months, finally.  I get it.  So you had a good time in Chicago.  That's good.  We'll try to move on from this.  No, it was fun.  It's fine.  I'll try.  I miss that.  Well, I've seen it makes you realize that you miss him because he's a genuine guy.  He really is not a phony guy, man, because he has nothing to gain by keeping in touch with me or any of us other than the fact that he really wants to. 
[00:25:00]  And when he was here, he understood the show, knew how to work it, knew the potential of this damn thing, and, you know, made us more successful.  Yeah, we butted heads with Eric.  Yeah, of course, because he was management in the end, you know.  Fuck yeah.  But he annoyed us.  We'd yell at him, and he yelled back.  I mean, it was part of it.  There's not a guy that walks around here that could walk in his shadow.  I'd make another joke, but I'll be nice. 
[00:25:30]  There's not a guy that walks these halls in a managerial position that could walk in fucking Elo's shadow.  We used to have Elo, and now we got, you know, cute guys.  And I don't mean cute in a way like, you know, I'm into that type of thing.  They're just cute.  They're like, you know.  Jobs are young.  Oh, you're all right.  Look, they're trying.  Maybe in another 10 years, I'll respect you.  Oh, my crying baby pictures from Sam.  I love it.  It's not fair to us. 
[00:26:00]  We had Elo, and now we got, like, cute guys.  They're trying.  I like when they come up after the show.  I just look and go, what is that?  Oshkosh bagosh you're wearing?  That's pretty good.  That's looking good.  You're trying.  Oh.  That's what they think around here.  That's what they think we need.  Guys that had no experience at this type of radio.  Yeah, what's it matter?  We have it here.  Elo leaves, and you give us a couple cute guys.  That's all we need.  Dude, we've been doing radio for years. 
[00:26:30]  We don't need anybody.  I understand.  I'll say at least they treat us nicely as people, those guys.  They treat us well as people.  Yeah.  But some people don't.  Yeah.  Some people don't.  You know what I mean?  Like, those guys, eh, they try.  They treat us well as guys.  They're nice dudes.  But some people don't even give us that respect.  Like, that's all you ask for.  It's like, they just.  No.  Ugh.  No.  I told you to shoot away.  I called up Steve last night.  Yes.  Not that one. 
[00:27:00]  Jesus Christ.  I got a great Steve story for you.  His phone would be fucking.  His phone would be ringing off the hook with fucking NBC and Fox FX people calling.  All right.  All right.  Oh, please.  No, I'll get right into it.  I was driving in just pissed off at the fact that all our shit is still on his site.  Take our videos and photos off of Foundry Music.  There.  That's an official fucking statement I'm making.  Steve Carlesi.  Remove our shit from your website. 
[00:27:30]  I thought.  Let's keep it friendly before, like, fucking, you know, people we all have to pay get involved.  Just take it off.  Make it your porn site or whatever the fuck Danny Bonaducey site you want to make it.  But get our shit off.  I don't want it there.  I thought he got the call to do that.  He did.  So what's going on?  20 times.  So what's going on now?  Things don't get pursued.  I think he called me, but I didn't really listen to his voicemail yet. 
[00:28:00]  He called about four days ago.  Just do it.  Like, I don't have some personal problem with Steve, you know, whatever.  But this is like a professional thing.  And he should understand that our shit no longer is a fucking, you know, bringing in people to his website.  I don't want that.  I agree.  I'm with you.  Fuck that.  Get rid of it.  Completely.  There.  It'll get back to him.  Everything else does.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  What do you mean? 
[00:28:30]  Nothing.  All the shit we were talking about.  I'm sure that'll get back to him.  With fucking guests and things.  That's all.  Well, we went to the Louis C.K. premiere.  Season two looks like it's going to be hilarious.  I've seen the first four episodes.  Yeah.  Roland sent them to me, but I really like it.  Louis is insane.  He's a genius, but he's mentally, he's insane.  He has an episode with Joan Rivers that's really.  And I'm talking to the FX guy. 
[00:29:00]  He's like, he's like, he's the guy, the marketing guy for FX.  He's, he's one of the big shots.  He goes, Hey, uh, does Steve still work for you?  And I go, no, man, you know, he left the, I don't know, about eight months ago or something.  You know, he goes, Oh, really?  I go, yeah.  Why?  He goes, well, I, I, I, I send all the FX stuff to Steve.  And he called me and said that he was moving and to just, you know, send all, um, the FX  stuff to his house.  Yes.  Keep sending. 
[00:29:30]  Here's the new address for my, our new offices are located at Steve.  Don't get mad at me, man.  Don't fucking kill the messenger.  Yes.  The FX guy basically told me that Steve said, yeah, I'm just moving.  So, so send all your promotional stuff and everything from FX to this, which is, which  is his house.  And Roland was standing right next to me and goes, that explains everything.  And then Roland said also NBC and HBO.  Oh, I don't know about that.  I don't either. 
[00:30:00]  But Roland, Roland was saying, I know about the FX thing.  He knows that.  Yeah.  From, we heard it from the guy from FX.  So I'm not sure if Steve is misrepresenting and saying he still works for us and, you  know, was getting the stuff sent to his house.  I don't know.  We're just not saying that he doesn't maybe.  Right.  Danny, I have quite the amount of contacts.  I don't know.  So that's where the FX, because my Louis stuff hadn't showed up.  No one's had.  And Roland dropped it off while I was gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I guess that's where it went. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Well, there's something called cease and desist.  Yes, there is.  So that's it with Chicago.  The tour of Harpo is good.  We did a morning TV show, which turned out to be pretty good.  I thought it was going to be awful.  Oh, wow.  Cool.  Like, you know, morning news thing, which turned out to be fun with all the guys.  Yeah.  But Chicago is a big market, so.  Yeah.  Oh, it was that windy, the windy city live.  It's Oprah's old. 
[00:31:00]  Do you know, I didn't know this, by the way.  When you walk in, they kept saying, this is where Oprah, we're in her slot now.  It was a night.  Did you know that she was on nine in the morning till 10 in the morning in Chicago and then four  in the afternoon everywhere else?  That was a live show in Chicago, I believe, in the morning.  The only place in the country was on in that time slot.  But it makes sense.  Like, oh, that's how stuff would leak out about, oh, this was going to be on the show today.  So-and-so said this.  I never knew it was a fucking morning show.  So I went on the show that replaced her show. 
[00:31:30]  Very good.  Nice.  You know, I don't know how.  It's kind of pretty hard.  Yeah, that's a hard act to follow right there.  That's a fucking rough spot to be in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you guys seeing blinking lights or am I having a stroke?  There's a fire alarm.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was the paparazzi.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's flashing and it's reflecting in all the windows in here.  Yeah.  I was taking pictures of me outside of Scandals.  Scandals.  It's his club.  Oh.  I did call.  I was going to, I was saying it earlier though. 
[00:32:00]  I called Steve because I needed a letter written up.  C?  And it was C.  C.  Sorry.  And within, you know, an hour or so, there it was in my email, all nicely done.  So, you know, I appreciated that.  I was like called, asked for something, received it.  It was done, you know, perfectly done.  I like Steve and I like working with him.  But the problem is the company gave him a huge promotion. 
[00:32:30]  So, he doesn't have enough time to invest in this channel.  And a lot of the duties were given to the cute guys.  That's my biggest issue.  The cute guys.  Do you mean Steve Blatter or Steve C.?  No, that was Steve Blatter.  Oh, I think it meant Steve C.  That's why I was saying C for cock.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, that's, I'm sorry.  Okay.  That's my, that's my frustration.  Like, we, or I.  C for queer.  Oh, wait a minute.  I can speak for myself.  I was, I was, I was, you know, I was fine with working with Steve Blatter.  You know, I think he has enough knowledge and stuff. 
[00:33:00]  And it was good.  And we were heading in a nice direction.  And then the company, because they do some really fucking weird things.  They gave him this massive promotion, but also said, then you could kind of babysit,  you know, the ONA channel.  And that's sort of what he does.  You could dabble in, you know, this show.  Well, so then he, then he doesn't have time for this channel.  I'm not, I'm not beating him up.  So then he, he brings on the two cute guys to do the day-to-day shit.  And, and, and they mean nothing to me, you know, they mean absolutely nothing to me. 
[00:33:30]  They're eventually, maybe they'll, they'll be great at this type of thing, but you know,  what the fuck, you know, I don't, we don't have time to wait around for that shit.  We're, we're on the top of our fucking game.  Nice enough guys.  The only problem with us, you know, here's what I don't like about Steve.  Whenever you're in a meeting with him and it's just you and him, well, he'll turn and face you  with his legs splayed out and then he rubs his crotch and he says, so how far do you  want to go in this company? 
[00:34:00]  He has to have that meeting.  Damn it.  I got, uh, there's another, um, very talented person that works here that is leaving after  today.  Sam?  Oh my God.  Oh, he's a talented person.  And this is what, very talented.  And this is what I've been telling, uh, I'm eliminating people in a frenzy in my head.  I can't think of one person who's leaving today.  See their, their philosophy, I'll say it again, is to pay one fucking guy. 
[00:34:30]  We all know that.  And I'm not, and you know, if you get that deal, God bless her.  So I'm not even beating up that guy, Howard, obviously we, we mentioned names here, but  the problem is because they pay one fucking guy.  No one has gotten raises around here in a really, really long time.  So other talented people are just leaving.  They're like, I don't need this anymore.  And we're losing another one today.  And I, I said this, you know, it has been happening and it continues to happen.  Is it an on air person?  So now they'll replace that guy with a guy that's willing to put up with a lot of shit, 
[00:35:00]  probably because his skill set isn't, uh, you know, up there on air, on air person or  is it a behind the scenes, behind the scenes, he's a rock star in his, uh, in, in his field  as far as, let me guess, uh, do I know him?  Yeah.  I'm going to take, again, this is, if it's the guy, he's not really, he's not really  associated with our show, but we like doing the writing thing.  Yeah, that, that, that's, that guy is such a, is good at what he does.  He's a rock star. 
[00:35:30]  I knew who you meant without even saying it.  He hasn't, that guy's going.  And he finally said, I don't need this.  And I told you, this is what's going to happen.  Uh, you know, it's going to happen a lot.  That's all right.  Because their philosophy is.  They'll just replace a maybe with somebody.  At a lower level.  That's what I'm saying.  And that's, and this is going on all the fucking time because their, their business plan was  to pay one guy and now that one guy is a part timer and people get mad when I write that  on Twitter, but he's a part timer. 
[00:36:00]  I did more shifts as a part timer than he's doing.  They're letting that guy go though.  That's a really dumb move.  Yeah.  He said what he wanted and they sort of said, um, I don't want to, I don't want to give  away his deal, but he said, look, this is what I need.  And they're like, well, we can't really do that, but I could give you a handshake on something  that might happen is what I heard.  Don't worry.  Down the road.  Don't worry.  Listeners.  Uh, you don't know who this person is.  They're behind the scenes kind of a thing, but they're good at what they do, but Jimmy  knows.  I immediately knew who you met when you said behind the scenes.  Honestly, God, he's a rock star.  What he does in that department. 
[00:36:30]  They love him and they're not happy that he's, he's like, no man, I'm done.  I'm fucking done.  What am I supposed to do?  Haven't had a raise in years.  You know, there's no motivation to work hard, especially on air is one thing, but, but  the behind the scene guys aren't getting any raises and it's like, what's the motivation  to do above and beyond if you know you're not going to get anything for it?  I don't know.  No bonus.  No nothing.  I don't know.  The, I don't understand the logic.  The whole place is going to collapse because the logic doesn't make sense.  Logic.  Because you pay the one guy and he's not even here anymore. 
[00:37:00]  There's this word.  So how does that make sense?  He had a, he had a big coup in the, in the news yesterday.  He's not even here to talk about it.  He'll talk about it in another four days.  He had, he had Benji at the, the Wiener press conference saying, you know, goodbye pervert.  Oh, is that easy?  And he's not even here to talk about it.  Are you seven inches?  I capitalize on it.  Dude, I heard, I listened to, are you, are you, are you heard, I heard that you're  seven inches when I laughed out loud when I heard that question.  Hilarious.  That's funny.  It's fucking funny, man.  When Benji did it the first time, I complimented him in the lobby of this damn building. 
[00:37:30]  Funny is funny.  But now, you know, the guy can't even capitalize on it because he doesn't.  Are you seven inches?  Are you seven inches?  Are you erect?  What a, what a, what a, what a, what a non-news question that is.  Seven inches.  Yeah, but the, the blonde broad on Morning Joe is not happy that that went down at the  press conference.  Why, because Benji is just asking in a way that's, what's the difference between what 
[00:38:00]  he's doing and you're doing?  He's just being honest about being obnoxious.  Exactly.  Fucking assholes at Morning Joe.  Goodbye, pervert.  I mean, perfectly timed.  They want to know exactly what it was he said in the text messages.  Did he have sex and appropriate?  You know how we talk about holes?  Yeah.  Me and Ant were watching Morning Joe right before the show started, and they're talking  about how, you know, the press conference was interrupted, and the guys on the show,  Jimmy, are kind of having a laugh over it.  They're like, thinking it's funny, all like, you know, and then she's like, well, it's 
[00:38:30]  funny, but can we move on?  Can we move on?  Yeah.  Wasn't that her exact quote?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we move on now?  All annoyed that the guys are having a little fun with what happened at the press conference.  It was pretty much an, oh, guys.  Huh?  Might as well have just been an, oh, guys.  Yeah, exactly.  Now.  What do you guys think of Wiener stepping down?  Yeah, he had to.  That was, it was so inevitable at that point.  It's just a bummer because.  Second, his woman got home from Africa, wherever the hell she was.  It's just a bummer because, you know, there's other politicians that are doing way worse, 
[00:39:00]  but they haven't been caught.  Oh, yeah.  They're just sitting in their offices knowing what they're doing is way the fuck worse than  what Wiener did.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  I would guarantee it.  Oh, hell yeah.  And I'm sure a few more of these things will pop out in the next year or two that are way  worse than Wiener.  Especially since they are looking.  They are just like the press and especially some of the bloggers, they want a big hit.  They want that big fucking hit that's going to make them big, you know? 
[00:39:30]  Right.  And so they're all poking around, asking questions.  Sure.  Trying to find something.  Trolling all these guys' Twitters and Facebooks and shit like that.  Looking deep.  Who do they know?  Who do they follow?  Who do they friend?  Yeah.  They'll get another one.  They'll find another one.  Don't worry, people.  This one's over, but there'll be another one for you to all point and laugh at.  And I don't think.  Like we do.  I really believe that Wiener didn't have any sex outside his marriage. 
[00:40:00]  You don't think so?  Nope.  That would have come out, I think.  Yeah, someone would have come forward because there's a lot of opportunities out there.  You know, that Ginger Lee was all bothered yesterday, right?  Is that Ginger Lynn?  Lee.  They're different people?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  It was Lee.  Ginger Lee.  She has Gloria Allred taking up her cause.  What cause?  We don't know.  We were trying to figure out what the cause is.  We played the audio yesterday.  We don't even know.  I fucking hate Gloria Allred.  We could not figure it out.  What a media pig she is.  We couldn't figure it out because Wiener was sort of talking about his package, but not even graphically. 
[00:40:30]  He was kind of like throwing it out there to see if Ginger Lee might be interested.  Yeah.  And she was reading, you know, these messages that Wiener sent out.  And me and Anna are sitting here like, why is she involved with this?  There's nothing here.  Yeah.  There's nothing here.  She's on her way to fucking do a strip show.  Right.  You know, that's another thing.  She's in a turtleneck.  She's dressed like a nun next to Allred. 
[00:41:00]  And she has to leave because she's got to fucking appear at a strip club.  Right.  To take her clothes off.  Right.  And flash her pussy.  Yeah.  For, you know, for money.  Problem?  God, I hate Gloria Allred.  Oh.  But is that what you went to law school for, Gloria?  Is to shuffle your little fat pig body onto television all the time?  She is a slob.  Oh, she's disgusting, man.  I'm watching this blonde.  How hateable.  I'm watching this blonde in the morning, Joe. 
[00:41:30]  I think we've got to start beating her up.  Is that the one who didn't like it?  Yeah.  The guys are having a little fun with it.  She's like, okay, but can we move on?  That's her job.  Okay, can we move on?  To be a remover of fun.  She's a fucking thief.  A laugh vacuum.  Willie's Week in Review.  Can you do it?  It was trash.  You guys want the audio of Wiener Resign?  Yeah, I've heard it, but I felt bad for him.  Even though what he did was kind of dumb, people who he represented seemed to like him. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, they were bummed out at the press conference.  A lot of his people were there in 20 years, man.  Seems like he was a pretty good politician, I guess.  Yeah.  And they're hinting that he could still maybe run for mayor.  Poof.  Now, there's too many.  Would you trust this man?  There's too many clips of him lying repeatedly and in different ways.  Looking like an idiot.  Yeah.  That's why he probably shouldn't have lied on this one.  Not after the first time.  Right out of the box, knowing how that would be spun down the road.  Yep. 
[00:42:30]  He probably shouldn't.  He should have just admitted everything immediately.  Yeah.  And then he goes away for a year or two, and then I think maybe he could kind of do something.  It would come back.  Do something.  Make a comeback.  But you're right.  They're going to just go to all the lies.  The lying.  And men.  Not lying.  We all know politicians lie, just about every single one of them, but they don't really  get caught lying.  Yeah.  This is a big one.  Yeah.  You can't really prove they're lying in most cases.  He'll get a job like Spitzer did, though.  He'll be on CNN.  He'll be on CNN or some other.  MSNBC.  There's a million places he can go. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  He'll do.  He'll do whatever.  Here's audio from the press conference.  I'm here today to again apologize for the personal mistakes I have made and the embarrassment  I have caused.  I make this apology to my neighbors and my constituents, but I make it particularly to  my wife, Huma.  I had hoped to be able to continue the work that the citizens of my district elected me  to do, to fight for the middle class and those struggling to make it. 
[00:43:30]  Unfortunately, the distraction that I have created has made that impossible.  So today I'm announcing my resignation from Congress.  Yeah!  Bye-bye, pervert!  Bye-bye, pervert!  Yeah!  Bye-bye, pervert!  And that's Benji from the Howard Stern Show, so...  That's funny, though.  Howard's here not to talk about, so we should talk about it for a second.  Yeah, everyone's laughing and shit.  It's awesome.  It's great.  Well, he...  I mean, Wiener's kind of a dummy. 
[00:44:00]  Doesn't he have people that can take a look at the room?  Look, either screen out your room or just a written statement.  Submit a written statement of your resignation.  Did this guy really, at this point, after all that's been done, have to get up in front  of the press again and fucking say the same shit, pretty much, except for the new thing,  I'm resigning?  Just put your letter of resignation out there, and this is why I'm resigning?  There's no reason to put your face on TV again. 
[00:44:30]  The problem is, he likes being on TV.  Yeah, well...  He likes the spotlight.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Was he grabbing his dick?  He wasn't grabbing his dick this time.  Grabbing his dick behind the podium?  He wasn't grabbing that dick.  Yeah.  But, uh, he's kind of dumb, because he's got to have people, he's got to have kind  of club sort of kennies and stuff.  Benji was at the first press conference, saying what he did.  What did he say at the first one?  I really forgot.  We were wrecked.  Oh, you were wrecked.  Sorry, yeah.  So now, he's...  I see Benji stand up as I'm watching the press conference. 
[00:45:00]  Just go like, oh no, here it comes.  His disguise was a hat, and he was holding a newspaper.  Like, doesn't Wiener have people to at least go make sure that guy's not here again?  Remember that guy from last time?  Yeah.  What is wrong with...  That was dumb.  What, is he a fucking gumshoe in the 50s with a hat and a new...  That's his...  Get a beard, stupid.  Yeah.  A press pass stuck in the head...  Fucking Jimmy Olsen.  Yeah.  That was his disguise.  Yeah.  All it would have taken was one of Wiener's people to take a quick look and go, oh, fuck, 
[00:45:30]  that guy's here again.  You know, let's move him to the back of the room or try to get him out of here.  Yeah, try to get him out of here or something.  Whatever.  Because it ruined his fucking moment.  That's great.  No one's going to remember this.  They're all going to just remember, goodbye, pervert.  Bye-bye, pervert.  Bye-bye, pervert.  You can't have someone stand up and yell, goodbye, pervert.  And they obviously could have prevented this if they were thinking.  Come on, that was great.  Anyway. 
[00:46:00]  So my colleagues can get back to work.  My neighbors can choose a new representative.  And most importantly, that my wife and I can continue to heal from the damage I have caused.  What is it?  Where are you fully erect?  The people demand to know.  The people demand to know.  The people weren't demanding to know.  Of course they weren't.  The people were demanding hilarity.  Show, yes, Benji made TMZ. 
[00:46:30]  Show these guys Benji.  All it was was a hat.  Like, how did, look.  Pause that.  A woman's trying to stop.  She has to stop.  She has to.  I can't be mad at her.  She's doing her job.  He's the only one standing up.  They're all sitting down.  He's yelling shit.  Look, that was his disguise.  He put a hat on.  Look.  I mean, come on.  The people want to know.  Look at the fat lady trying to grab him.  Oh, yeah.  Wiener deserves it.  His people should have been able to figure this one out.  That the same guy's there just in a hat. 
[00:47:00]  We just released a statement.  Don't make it a big deal.  Some people are saying they didn't care.  They didn't care to filter him out.  They're like, fuck you, Wiener.  These are people now.  They're going to be out of a gig and shit like that.  They're just like, fuck you.  No, Wiener's got his friends.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not talking about the people that were working for Wiener.  They don't care anymore.  Yeah.  I'm talking about his real friendships.  There had to be a guy there that is a real pal of his.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  In official capacity, they probably couldn't do anything. 
[00:47:30]  Probably need real people.  Real security guards.  To repeat, most importantly, most importantly so that I can continue to heal from the damage  that I have caused. 
[00:48:00]  I want to thank my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans  alike.  For throwing me out.  They come from different places around the country, but fundamentally, we all agree.  They're all patriots, and I will miss them all.  Are you more than seven inches?  Thank you.  Are you more than seven inches?  Are you more than seven inches?  It was funny because he yelled something that he timed in a second and then knew and yelled.  Oh, yeah.  I was almost annoyed for Wiener for talking over the question.  Yeah, stop it.  I want to hear. 
[00:48:30]  That's really funny, man.  Good for Benji.  Love that shit.  Who is he on Twitter?  He should get a little help today.  Huh?  Do you know offhand?  Bronk.  Bronk?  B-R-O-N-K.  I don't go for that public stuff.  See, Howard would be doing all this, but he's got more days that he's got to take off.  He's got a great agent.  Good for fucking him.  I would love to fucking not be here right now.  I mean, we look at it like, hey, the guy, he's looking at it like he lost a hundred million dollars. 
[00:49:00]  He's looking at it like they got me for a hundred million less.  Right.  So fuck you.  It's all relative.  Even he's mad at this place.  Yeah.  Are we good with those two guys?  Have they talked to you since the Paris Hilton thing?  I have not said a word to them.  I haven't said anything.  We had an awkward, you know, passing each other in the hallway.  I will not speak to them.  With the gay channel.  The gay guy, the channel, Al Q, I like those guys a lot.  I would ride up to the elevator with Keith every morning.  I'd see him.  And he's a nice guy. 
[00:49:30]  And the other guy, Larry, I would say hello to.  Larry.  It's like you're not going to apologize for blasting us when we didn't do anything.  I have nothing to say to them.  Yeah.  I'm not saying they got to grovel.  Just say, hey, man, sorry about that.  We were a little, you know.  That's it.  That's how they really feel about us.  I agree.  That's fine.  I agree.  We don't need to be in contact with each other.  Thank you.  I also want to express my gratitude to members of my staff. 
[00:50:00]  There are young people who are not paid very much.  There are people that work very hard in very long hours.  Holy shit, he's talking about Sirius XM.  Hey, wow.  I didn't know he worked here.  Listen, he's talking about Sirius XM.  Fantastic.  He ruined that press conference.  He really did blow it up.  He spoiled it for everyone.  If you're a wiener at that point, you have nothing to lose.  Wouldn't you just fucking march into the audience and punch him in the face?  Punch him in the face.  He probably wanted to out of frustration.  But just ignore what's going on in front of you, right? 
[00:50:30]  Young people who are not paid very much.  There are people that work very hard in very long hours.  Ultimately, those people define the notion of service.  I want to thank, of course, the many people who have helped me.  The people who have volunteered.  The people who have given me advice.  The many of my constituents who have offered me good ideas.  Like leaving.  And, of course, I want to express my gratitude to my family.  To my mother and father who instilled in me the values that carried me this far. 
[00:51:00]  Values.  To my brother, Jason.  And, of course, to my wife, Uma.  Who has stood with me in this entire difficult period.  Did he thank his parents for the values?  For the values they instilled in him?  What?  Fucking grabbing your dick and sending it out to fucking girls you don't know?  I think Andy Levy.  I think it was him.  He's a great one to follow on Twitter.  Oh, yes.  And it's Andy Levy on Twitter.  He quoted that.  Like, I want to thank my parents for the family values they instilled on him.  Yes.  Whatever.  And then Andy writes, and at that point, his parents backed out of the room. 
[00:51:30]  Backed out of the room slowly.  Slowly.  You read it, too?  It was very funny.  Yeah.  I almost had the exact tweet in front of me to give it justice, but it was really funny.  You got it?  I think you got it, yeah.  Where is it?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Oh, here it is.  Andy Levy on Twitter.  Wiener thanks parents for instilling his values.  Parents back slowly out of the room.  Who has stood with me for this entire difficult period, and to whom I owe so very much. 
[00:52:00]  I got into politics to help your voice to the many who simply did not have one.  Now I'll be looking for other ways to contribute my talents to make sure that we live up to  that most New York and American of ideals.  Grabbing your cock on film.  The idea that leaving a family, a community, and ultimately a country is the one thing  that all unites us.  The one thing we're all focused on.  Oh, stop.  With God's help and with hard work, we will all be successful. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you and good afternoon.  Will you maintain your hot physique?  Will you what?  Maintain your hot physique.  How is he not thrown out?  His voice is cutting, too.  It really is.  That sounds like that.  It's a cutting voice.  Was there two guys on?  He's got a hot physique.  Who was the other guy that should get credit for this?  They don't know, but Benji said he's not the one who said goodbye, pervert. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, really?  Really?  Yeah, he said that wasn't it.  Controversy.  By the way, he's smart because he's not cursing either.  He's not giving them a reason to do anything other than just be annoyed at him.  He's that smart, actually.  Who said goodbye, pervert?  Nobody knows.  It's a mystery.  You think that was somebody with him or that was just a person in the audience?  Probably some other radio shock jock.  Hopefully it was one of our people.  Yeah, it was actually Travis.  Travis?  Yeah.  Let's get the word out.  Grab it up, whatever. 
[00:53:30]  Travis Taft.  I said that.  Bye, perverts.  Chippa.  Why would you pluralize that?  Chippa D.  My mother didn't go for that stuff.  No Playboy magazine.  She was into construction and stuff, like black inches.  That was all about people that was building stuff.  Out of ebony?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She liked black inches.  It was weird.  She would smack me for looking at it.  Chippa.  Oh, yeah.  Put that down, Chippa.  She went, yes, it was inside, probably. 
[00:54:00]  Put down mother's toilet reading.  Very cool.  A lot of people are on the phones wanting to talk about it.  Oh, yeah.  I think we did.  The one guy goes, look, if he was honest from the get-go, he would have got away with it.  Yeah, we fucking pounded that.  Yeah, Chad, I agree with you.  Yeah.  But now they got video of him lying, and that's going to fuck him up as far as trying to make  a comeback.  But he wouldn't have, eventually would have gotten away with it.  The scandal would have continued.  He would not get away with it, but he would have been able to go away for a while, and 
[00:54:30]  then come back saying, look, I was honest, you know?  I screwed up.  Right.  I think we forgive if enough time goes by.  No one gives a fuck about Spitzer.  Yeah.  He didn't fuck anybody.  Spitzer's got a fucking TV show.  Yeah.  On a network that's supposedly respectable.  I don't know.  That's up to you to decide.  And no one cares.  They're just like, man, whatever.  He went through the mill.  CNN's got a guy that was banging whores.  Yeah.  They don't care.  Tiger doesn't. 
[00:55:00]  Who cares about Tiger?  Whatever.  Oh, Jesus.  Like a woman's punching this fucking.  What happened?  There's fights outside of the Casey Anthony trial, because they're only allowing 50 people  in a day.  Oh, wow.  And a bunch of people line up.  And there are fist fights going on, because these fucking vultures want to sit in that  courtroom and watch.  And they were saying some of the people get in there, and then they fall asleep sitting 
[00:55:30]  at the fucking, in the gallery.  Because they were there all night waiting.  Yeah.  And they fight online.  And so many people don't understand that whole thing, either.  And court's boring.  Court, for the most part, is a very dull thing.  I mean, they go over things so many times.  They ask the same question.  Did you say ad nauseum?  Ad nauseum.  Yesterday, the defense got up there in the Casey Anthony trial and started chipping. 
[00:56:00]  What's that?  Chipping away at the prosecution's case.  The prosecution rested.  And they were doing a pretty good job.  But the questions they ask these witnesses are, it's over and over again.  And sit there and watch as the defense goes, take a look at this picture here of some of  the items that were picked up around where the body was picked up.  I'm like, okay, do you recognize these as recovered from the area? 
[00:56:30]  Yes, I do.  Did you catalog these or in any way attach them to the crime?  It's paraphrasing, obviously.  No, I didn't.  Okay, take a look at this picture.  These are items collected from the crime scene.  Oh, my God.  And they just, because you can't take a picture of all the shit that they picked up.  So every picture, they had to present to the witness and ask the same exact question.  And if you're sitting there, you're just like, oh. 
[00:57:00]  Because you have to read that in 10 years in a transcript to know exactly what they're referencing.  And an appeal, you got to make sure every base was covered.  Wouldn't you rather watch an edited version of the trial?  They do that.  In real time, that's got to be.  I find it fascinating.  I'm a guy that could take redundancy.  I'll sit there and just watch the whole fucking thing live.  But they do have a recap version.  And they come in and show you the highlights of what happened.  Oh, that'd be cool.  What the big moments were in the trial. 
[00:57:30]  Sure.  But then you don't really get a good idea of what's going on in the trial.  And what the jury then has to deal with.  Because they're not getting just the highlights.  The jury is having to sit there through these just arduous fucking presentations of redundant evidence.  Again, after watching yesterday's trial, I will say I think the defense is doing a job with the prosecution's case.  I think they're putting some holes in it. 
[00:58:00]  I don't think the prosecution at all even proved anything.  They proved that she was a horrid mother.  Not even physically.  The child was well taken care of right up until she was dead.  But never any signs of abuse or anything.  And there's nothing tangible connecting her to that dead child.  And it's amazing. 
[00:58:30]  I really think she's going to get off of this.  She's going to beat this rap.  Well, she'll do time for lesser charges, right?  Who knows?  Really?  Who knows?  I mean, they're not going to get her on the murder one.  I don't think they're going to get her on the aggravated child abuse because there wasn't any sign of that.  Can they get her on manslaughter or any of that shit?  That all depends, too.  This is a weird situation they're in.  A few of the jurors are very against the death penalty.  There's one juror that is very religious. 
[00:59:00]  She has children, but she was saying that she would have a very difficult time giving anybody the death penalty.  She's, I guess, a 40-year-old black woman.  And she's got three kids.  And her occupation, it said, undetermined.  What the fuck does that even mean?  But, yeah, I don't know.  I think she's walking.  Maybe not walking, but she's not.  These people that are on all these dumb fucking Yenta websites saying, I can't wait until they slide that needle in her arm and she's dead just like her baby was. 
[00:59:30]  Ain't gonna happen.  Don't get all worked up about that, toots.  It ain't fucking happening.  Don't get yourself in a lather.  Yeah, in a lather.  In a tizzy.  In a fucking, in a blood frenzy.  They're in a blood lust, these Yentas.  They want to see her dead so bad and it ain't gonna happen.  No.  She's not getting it. 
[01:00:00]  And people are pointing out other things.  It's like, this case is purely circumstantial.  Which doesn't mean it's unwinnable.  Well, and then they go, well, the fucking, the Peterson trial, that was based on circumstantial evidence.  Well, they had bodies that did have forensic evidence on it, DNA.  They had hairs that had DNA connected to this boat that he took out.  He needed an alibi for a distinct time. 
[01:00:30]  And his alibi was, I was fishing.  And then they found in the ocean, this woman doesn't even need an alibi for a time because  they don't have an exact timeline of when they died.  She didn't leave and go somewhere.  And then the kid disappeared.  There were 31 days that went by where she could have been anywhere.  You should be a pen pal.  Yeah.  Why don't you try to be a pen pal?  Oh, I have her address.  I just haven't.  So write a letter.  I can't work up the nerve to write her.  I'm so nervous.  Just write a letter and see what happens. 
[01:01:00]  You're obviously.  How should I start it?  You're obviously attracted to her.  It's the only reason you're watching this damn thing.  I'm a little smitten with her.  You have to be.  She's right up my alley.  Bat shit crazy and looks like complete white trash.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And people are getting so mad at me for bringing this shit up.  But then I hear this other fucking these dummies that call in and I sit there like an idiot watching this HLN headline news show and they have 18 shows after the trial and they just pound the same shit out. 
[01:01:30]  But they take live callers and hear these women, all these women, you just picture fat on the phone, not knowing shit, just that they hate this woman because they have kids that maybe they want to kill, but they haven't.  Who the hell knows?  Hello.  I just want to know, you know, the defense has not proven one bit that she was drowned in that pool.  It's like the defense doesn't have to prove shit.  Don't you know the Constitution? 
[01:02:00]  Don't you know what the rights of the defendant are?  The defense does not have to prove anything.  All they have to do is cast doubt in what the prosecution said.  That's why they get last ups.  You know, the prosecution presents their case and then the defense only has to go.  Really?  So she killed her child.  Well, couldn't it be, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, couldn't what they presented have happened this way and then present a viable alternative to what the prosecution came up with? 
[01:02:30]  And then the jury goes, well, you know what?  It's reasonable.  And now I doubt what the prosecution said.  Goodbye.  She walks.  That's how I'm fucking singing it.  Oh, my God.  You do realize there's a dead kid involved, right?  Doesn't matter to me.  I'm looking at it as a trial.  I'm not looking at it emotionally.  I'm looking at this like a juror is supposed to look at it. 
[01:03:00]  But deep in your soul, because you're not a juror.  Yeah.  Does she have something to do with the death of her child?  There's something going on.  Don't know what it is.  It ain't murder one.  I'll tell you that.  And if it is, the prosecution hadn't proved it.  They had not fucking proved it.  Yes, the blind justice.  Let us not let emotion get us involved in this, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  We know that Casey Marie Anthony is a liar. 
[01:03:30]  We know she was not the best mother.  But killing her own child and then disposing of the body like so much trash, that was beyond what my client would have done.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the defense would have you believe.  That's what it'll be, too.  Would have you believe.  And they yell.  Would you do that?  And they yell at the jury.  It's like, oh, you're yelling at me.  Stop it.  Casey Anthony said, and I don't know the fact. 
[01:04:00]  Casey Anthony said that she was looking for a babysitter who did not exist.  She wanted you to believe her.  Casey Anthony said she was here when she wasn't.  She wanted you to believe her.  Casey Anthony says, I didn't kill my child.  She wants you to believe her.  The woman is a proven liar.  And she's been proven time after time to lie.  Why should we believe her now?  Why, in this most important instance, would she be telling the truth?  Well, more showmanship from the prosecution.  I wasn't finished. 
[01:04:30]  Order in the court.  Order in the court.  You're out of order.  This whole place is out of order.  There's no evidence that suggests that she murdered her child.  No DNA evidence.  No witnesses.  No means of murder.  That's inconclusive as to how this child even died. 
[01:05:00]  Their experts, their parade of experts that have come out could not tell this jury how this child died.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, all you need to know is that this woman did not report her child missing for 31 days.  She lied repeatedly about who the child had been with.  She made up searches for people who did not exist.  And by gum, she had titties to die for. 
[01:05:30]  Yes, this is something I think the defense and the prosecution can agree with.  Her giant milky jugs.  We opened her juicy ass.  We opened her trunk and it smelled like somebody had left a jack in the box.  Breakfast and forgot to take a breakfast jack.  I don't wish I knew enough facts.  I don't know much about it.  I'm just going by what you said.  Yes.  Well, you're pretty much right.  That is what they say.  The lying, all that, and the fact that she lied. 
[01:06:00]  But there's just, I don't think they did their job.  See, and now the emotions.  The emotions get in the way.  Look at this guy on line nine.  Emotions.  Let's talk to him.  You've got to separate yourself from that, my friend.  Who is this motherfucker?  Steve in Pennsylvania, Steve.  Yes.  Danny Bonaduce.  You're a soulless bag of shit.  All right.  Why?  Do you think she did it? 
[01:06:30]  Yes.  And do you think the prosecution proved that she did it, even though the defense isn't done yet?  But do you think the prosecution did a good job of proving that she committed a willful murder on this child?  Absolutely.  They should burn her at the stake.  She is nothing but Satan's whore.  All right.  She's a liar, a whore.  What gives you the idea that she murdered this child? 
[01:07:00]  Give me that big piece of evidence.  I have a strong inkling that she is.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  I have a strong inkling.  You know, inkling did set a precedent in inkling versus Jones back then.  You think a lawyer could get away with an inkling?  I have a strong inkling.  No.  No?  You don't think the judge would appreciate that?  I don't think an inkling has any place in a court of law. 
[01:07:30]  But I'm keeping tabs on this.  And boy, when that verdict comes out, I'll be there.  With flowers for her?  With some flowers.  And a limo to pick her up.  An invitation to the compound where there are no children.  Don't you worry about it.  You should fly her up.  First class airfare.  Oh, of course.  Please try to make this happen.  I'll fly her up.  Please try to make this happen.  You've got to write the letter.  You've got to become a pen pal.  I've got to be one of those prison pen pals? 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  How should I start off?  Should I start off, like, hot and heavy?  Or should I start off kind of...  I don't want to look like every other guy that's writing their letters.  I would brag about your big cock.  What about the radio show?  The radio show is not that impressive.  We're the only radio show to be defending.  No, it's really not that impressive.  It used to mean something out there in the world.  Yeah, that's not that impressive.  I think the size of your cock is more important.  I think I should go in hot and heavy with maybe a little humor,  because she does like to laugh.  I've seen her do it in the courtroom, facing the death penalty. 
[01:08:30]  What a psychopath this woman is.  What is it you're giggling about while facing death with your murdered child  being talked about?  What are you giggling good-naturedly about?  She's chuckling in the courtroom.  Yeah, why are you chortling like someone's tickling you,  you fucking sociopath?  It's nervous tension, obviously.  She's getting it out.  But some people do it differently.  But why wouldn't the lawyer lean over and go,  will you knock it off?  I'm trying to get you off here, you dummy.  They do.  Stop laughing.  What are you laughing at?  I think they've told her that.  But, you know, nervous tension, as I said. 
[01:09:00]  Nervous tension.  And the fact that she didn't report the child missing for 31 days  goes back to her emotional state.  She covered things up her entire life.  That's what made her a liar.  She had to lie about horrid things that happened during her childhood.  But I think her lawyer leans over and says up,  you should probably stop laughing.  They're talking about how bad the trunk smelled.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Don't.  Stop giggling.  They're talking about the plastic bag.  Yes.  And the lawyers are arguing whether it was a trash bag or a garbage bag. 
[01:09:30]  And people started laughing at the semantics aspect of it.  As you say that.  And she, um...  As you say that.  They're showing her laughing on CNN.  She's adorable when she laughs, right?  Right on cue.  CNN's got her kind of smiling and giggling.  Smile.  And now the end of it.  The Trinity test, I thought, was a bombshell.  Let's face it.  The defense theory is the reason she acted this way for 31 days,  not reporting, partying, all this type of thing,  is because she was sexually abused by her father.  There you go.  He also said, Jose Baez, in the opening statement, 
[01:10:00]  that she was also sexually abused by her brother.  Without Casey Anthony having to get on the stand,  we find out that the FBI conducted a paternity test  to determine whether or not Lee Anthony was the source,  was the father of Kaylee.  But what they left out, which was brilliant,  is that the prosecutors said, I mean,  the prosecutors then, after the recess, said,  no, they did DNA testing.  They did, right?  They did paternity testing,  and it's neither the father nor the brother's child.  Right, but the question is,  why would the FBI even conduct a test  if the allegations of sexual abuse were killed?  It makes it look, oh boy,  did the prosecution get pissed at that one, 
[01:10:30]  and they threw the jury out to discuss this one.  It was a biggie.  What a coup for the defense.  What happened there?  I'm a little lost.  Making sure that the father or the brother  isn't the father of the kid.  The defense is making allegations  that there was some sexual misconduct  between the father and Casey,  and the brother and Casey.  And what the defense did was  had the FBI do paternity tests, 
[01:11:00]  because they don't know who the father of this kid is,  by the way.  Oh, they don't?  They have no idea.  So they did.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Has she said who the father is?  Nope.  Oh, boy.  Does she know?  If she knows, she's, again,  maybe lying,  because she does that very well.  Actually, she's pretty bad at it.  But now they made these allegations.  So they had a paternity test given  to at least the brother.  Casey Anthony's brother?  Yes.  Who was how old?  Like her age?  A little older.  Okay.  They brought that up, 
[01:11:30]  and the defense brought it up yesterday,  asking a witness if this paternity test was given.  Not the results,  because he didn't want the results.  The results were,  it's not the father.  He's not the father of this child.  But the defense never brought that up to the witness.  Just said, you know,  this paternity test was given.  Now, as a juror,  you've got to sit there and go,  holy shit, why?  In what kind of fucking family anywhere  do you have to give a brother a paternity test 
[01:12:00]  to see if he's the father of the sister?  Regardless of the outcome,  it just makes it look like she might have been.  It puts more weight on the fact  that she might have been abused as a child,  and that explains some of her actions in this,  not as far as killing her child goes,  but as far as being able to have a child go missing  or accidentally die and then stashing it,  and then being able to live her life, 
[01:12:30]  you know,  her beautiful life.  Vita,  her Bella Vita,  as they said,  which is tattooed on her back a day  after her child went missing.  Is this going to...  It just doesn't look good.  No!  They are definitely doing a great job of,  like I said,  little tink, tink, tink, tink.  They're chiseling away.  I believe she killed her kid  and then a beautiful life  was her psychotic tribute to the kid.  To the kid. 
[01:13:00]  She had a beautiful life,  or she is a beautiful...  You know, just a fucking...  What they're going for is  the child died accidentally.  Her and or the father,  either together or separately,  were so fucked up by this  and knowing how the grandmother would act,  the father's wife,  the daughter's mother,  they decided to stash the kid  in the woods,  make it look like some type of kidnapping,  perhaps with the duct tape around her mouth, 
[01:13:30]  and ditched her there,  which would have been an accidental death  and then getting rid of the body,  which is, you know,  maybe negligent, homicide, manslaughter,  not even manslaughter,  but...  And then disposal of a body,  things like that.  But it sure as fuck ain't capital murder.  What?  Yeah, maybe they won't.  You're probably right.  They won't get her on that.  There's too much doubt.  These jurors are going to be...  Their heads are going to be spinning  when they deliberate  with all the inconsistencies 
[01:14:00]  and doubt that is cast.  But the paternity test,  I guess it's when the glove was put on,  when Darden,  just again,  the prosecution stinks in California.  When he had him put the glove on,  and there was a reason it didn't fit.  And then they had to do  all this damage control,  which was,  because it had shrunk,  and blah, blah, blah.  So they got the real answers,  but the damage was done.  Damage is done.  Once the damage is done,  it's very hard to undo,  because that stands out.  People want to see the drama.  They want to have those 
[01:14:30]  whole moments.  They don't want the  hours of explanation  as to why the moment  wasn't a big moment.  Because in your head,  it was a big moment.  You're not going to  explain it away.  But couldn't they,  now that you just get the FBI  and say,  why did you do this?  Well, when somebody alleges  that somebody's the father,  we have to take it seriously  in all cases.  Doesn't matter.  So what were the results of the test?  Negative, negative.  That almost strengthens  what they said.  So the father's not the other thing.  It almost does.  But when you get a juror  sitting there thinking,  you know,  I've never had to give  my brother a paternity test  to see if he had sex 
[01:15:00]  with my sister.  So in the one physical test  you possibly could do  to determine if incest  had taken place,  the results were what?  Negative.  That's the only way  to spin it.  It doesn't necessarily mean  it didn't happen.  It means that they didn't  get her pregnant.  But that's what I'm saying,  the only evidence that you,  the only possible  physical evidence  that you could investigate  would be paternity.  The only way to investigate it,  you did do that.  The defense asked for it.  And at the defense's request, 
[01:15:30]  and what was it?  Zero.  Negative.  Yeah, well,  like I said,  I am your Casey Anthony trial,  your tot mom source.  And I keep everyone posted,  too, on Twitter  when the trial's going on,  especially the fat,  loudmouth housewives  that want to have her killed.  And I will tweet such things  as,  leave lovely Casey alone.  She's too pretty to be guilty.  Boy, do they get angry. 
[01:16:00]  Do they get angry at that?  Oh, they get hot under the collar?  They get angry.  All right.  Oh, especially when I quote them.  Yeah.  I retweet them,  and I change their words  to make it seem like  they're for Casey Anthony.  Right.  That's my new gig.  And they have to now respond  that they didn't say that.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  They get so mad.  You twist their words?  I twist their words  to make it sound like  they actually are supporting Casey.  And I put things like, 
[01:16:30]  we're all behind you.  All capital letters.  And they're like,  I'm not behind her.  Don't lump me in with,  oh, another jealous housewife  just because she's pretty  and you're fat.  Oh, it's infuriating  and hilarious.  You're a monster.  I wish you a break.  You're not a monster.  It's crazy.  You're a monster.  We got lots to do today.  Hey, did you take my request, Gregorio?  What's that?  I sent you a tweet yesterday.  Oh, yes.  I saw alcohol false.  I wanted to respond, 
[01:17:00]  but they were all too long.  What happened?  I couldn't give you  the at mention  because I had to call you Gregorio.  Gregorio.  I thought someone  would let you know.  Fuck no one let me know.  Hold on a minute.  I axed him to.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Should I do this  after the break?  Yeah, it's brief.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  I was talking to Antony.  I was talking to you.  Antony, I saw that one too.  I wanted to know  if you followed my request.  It's pretty bad. 
[01:17:30]  What did he write?  Hold on a second.  What's it say?  What did he write?  Let me see, Sam.  Oh, someone remind Gregorio  to keep it all shaved down there.  I want to play turkey pubis.  It's like turkey foot,  but on the pubis.  Pubis.  Uncle Paul's so disgustingly creepy.  It's awful.  Go, go, go.  With his cigarette breath. 
[01:18:00]  It's so uncomfortable.  Saliva's got like a brown tinge to it  from all the smoking.  From the nicotine.  The non-filtered Paul balls.  Fuck.  I could scrape my fingernail  through the plaque  across my teeth.  Oh, shit.  Do you want to smell it?  No.  No, thank you, Uncle Paul.  I got to eat.  Well, when we get back,  we got some Mayor Minino audio.  Oh, good.  About the Bruins.  Very proud, I bet.  And God, I love Vancouver 
[01:18:30]  for giving me some just great stuff to watch.  Those videos are amazing.  Did you see Grenade?  Not Grenade.  The guy that got a flashbang in the balls?  Yeah, what was it?  A tear gas?  It's hilarious.  Tear gas to the balls?  Yeah.  Have you?  You saw that, right?  Hilarious.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah, you Vancouver guys are crazy.  We'll talk about the riots a little bit.  Mayor Minino is talking about the Bruins.  And we're going to debut BoboCop when we get back.

Hey, this is Steve-o  and you're listening to the Opie and Andy show.  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I?  All right.  Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, I've got to quickly say that I'm Sully Erna, 
[01:22:30]  who is the lead singer of Godsmack.  Of course he is.  I went to his show last night  and wow, it was really, really cool.  Yeah.  Very, very, very different  than what he does with Godsmack. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, yes.  Maybe it's not even worth talking about  because I think it might have been  the last night of the solo tour.  Oh, really?  I think.  Just look for him in Godsmack.  But he's a talented motherfucker, man.  Yeah.  He does all sorts of stuff  when he's not with Godsmack  and then he could hear some of the elements  he was doing last night  and you could tell that he would bring some of that  to the Godsmack music.  Like, he's a motherfucker on the bongos.  Then all of a sudden he sits behind a piano  and to me, he seems like he's a great piano player. 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  Dude, it's like, fuck it.  That guy is a musician and a talented artist.  Yes.  Like, some people are in the music business  and they, you know, one-trick ponies,  they suck, whatever.  You go like, oh, God,  why is this person even famous in music?  That guy is the real deal.  Oh, yeah.  Amazing.  He's absolutely an artist  and you could tell because he didn't,  he wasn't going for commercial success with this show.  It's like, this is what I do. 
[01:24:00]  This is what I want to do.  This is my passion.  At one point, he's sitting behind the piano  and he's sounding like Elton John.  I'm sitting there going,  if I didn't know any better,  I would think this is some obscure Elton John song.  Then next thing you know, he's on a guitar.  Then he's vocalizing with some female and a cellist.  And then they're playing the bongos like lunatics.  It was a little of everything.  Yeah.  Very enjoyable.  Yeah, he's something, man.  He really is like,  ever since we first met him,  you knew he was just like, 
[01:24:30]  not like the normal,  just kind of run of the mill,  kicking around band guy.  Like he was one of those,  like, oh, this guy knows how to fucking write music  and perform.  And he's got the passion.  Yeah.  He was up on that stage,  just really, really,  still,  really enjoying himself.  He was good, right?  I should have went.  He was good.  It's different though.  Yeah.  You know,  it's not commercial.  It's not commercial.  You know,  you think it's going to be acoustic,  Godsmack songs,  maybe some covers and this and that.  It was trippy at times. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Really trippy.  The new album's called Avalon.  I can't give you a review.  I haven't heard it yet.  But it seems like a bunch of people are definitely digging it.  We played some stuff on Boneyard.  From Avalon?  Yeah.  I think Troy was,  we had a couple of songs,  singles we played.  And I was happy.  The interview was good.  I heard that we were coming.  We had just landed.  We were in the car.  Fucking traffic.  You landed in a car?  It was really weird.  Yeah.  I said motherfucking Puck Chitty.  Chitty, Chitty, Bang Bang. 
[01:25:30]  And the interview was very good, man.  It was,  you guys were great with him.  And he was good too.  I'm bummed we didn't have more time.  And then at one point,  he just looks over at Rich Voss,  who was in yesterday,  and goes,  where's Jimmy?  Did he say that?  I would let him in the toilet.  He's like,  where's Jimmy?  I missed that.  I missed that guy.  But it was right after Voss was,  babbling about something.  On some journey of his own.  Yeah.  That was really funny.  Because he really didn't mean anything by it.  He didn't mean,  hey, Voss,  you suck. 
[01:26:00]  Where's Jimmy?  But the way he said it,  and the timing,  we just started laughing our asses off.  Oh my God.  I said that the audience is saying the same thing.  Where's Jimmy?  I busted in the tunnel when that happened.  Because of course,  we cut out coming through the Lincoln,  so I missed like four minutes.  And Voss was great yesterday.  I'm not taking anything away from Rich.  Yeah, yeah.  He was really good.  He was a lot of fun yesterday.  But Sully from Godsmack,  he missed you, Jimmy.  So he did a little something for you.  Oh.  This is going to be a little surprise for Jim Norton.  I love surprises.  Do you know what this is about?  I certainly don't.  But I love surprises. 
[01:26:30]  Well,  after the fine interview with our old pal,  Sully went into the production studio.  Know this.  Did a little something for Jim Norton.  Surprise to me too.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  Your naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  Good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.

[01:28:00]  Somebody needs credit  Who came up with the idea to have some of these guys possibly do this for Jimmy?  Watch them fight  They won't be a pass the buck now  They're all going to fight to take credit  We all did  We all did  Oh, there it goes  That means Sam didn't have the idea  How about here's who did the idea?  Jim Norton  Ah, that's right  Him have a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone  A naughty boy phone and him good boy phone  That's great  He sounded like Gordon Lightfoot a little bit

Because I had to go home  I had to  You know, I couldn't stay for the entire show  I made it through most of it  Most of it  I wonder if he did voodoo last night  That is kind of funny  That Gordon Lightfoot thing  Wow  Because it is almost Edmund Fitzgerald  Yeah, absolutely

[01:49:00]  Yeah that's Teddy  That's Teddy and his little brother  The one on the other side's the girl  She's kinda tomboyish  She likes to play basketball  Have her socks taken off  Coochie Coo  You tickle him in a tub  Oh Uncle Paul  My feet are dirty  You wash him  Get him in a tub  Clean their feet good  Take your shorts off  Let me kiss your toes  Oh yeah  They all had to stay in my bed 
[01:49:30]  Cause they all had bed bugs in their cribs  Come in here  So there's no bed bugs  And then them god damn parents are accusing me  Saying how come he ain't walking right  I don't know  I didn't do nothing  Bunch of lies  Those damn denar tests  They said my denar was on the boy's hiney  I don't know what that means  Who's that old guy over there  Uncle Paul  Uncle Paul  With the creepy old guy stare  Uncle Paul  And now he's coming over here 
[01:50:00]  Slowly limping down the hall  It's too late now  Cause here comes Uncle Paul  The virus  Sirius  Sirius X  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony  O.B. and Anthony  This is the old Sully  Godsmack Sully  This is the old Sully  The new Sully  You heard today  Oh you want to hear that again?  No  We can do that  But that is to me 
[01:50:30]  We had Sully from Godsmack in yesterday  And he's a big fan of Jimmy  And Jimmy's comedy  Yeah he comes every time  I'm in Boston  Sully comes  And he was very bummed  You weren't here yesterday  And Sully said  Well I'll do a little something  For Jim Norton  We just played this  But you know  People are tuning in all the time  So in case you missed it  Here's Sully  Doing a little something  For Jim Norton  Good boy phone 
[01:51:00]  And your naughty boy phone  You naughty boy phone  And your good boy phone  Good boy phone  And your naughty boy phone  Naughty boy phone  And your good boy phone  Good boy phone  Is when you're home  With the old crow  And your naughty boy phone  Is when nobody's home  And that little fucking whore from Canada blows up your phone 
[01:51:30]  It's your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone  Your naughty boy phone and your good boy phone  Your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone  Naughty boy phone and your good boy phone  I like the naughty boy phone  How cool is Sully that he did that for Jim Norton, huh?  Very.  Well, he could probably sense it's a hit. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  He knows it's a hit when he hears one.  But I want Sully to understand that I wrote that.  And I don't want him taking credit for those amazing lyrics.  So what's going on in the halls, man?  You know what we need before the next...  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That's the uncomfortableness.  Before I forget, though, you know what we need before Stephen Wright comes in?  Our guest.  Yeah, what?  Two little zip strip ties.  Oh.  To put around that fucking mic.  We look like idiots every time a guest grabs the mic to bring it down. 
[01:52:30]  And every fucking time that mic pops out and the mic stand goes, wah, springing up.  And they're holding a mic and then they got to try to snap it in.  It's one of the most fucking embarrassing, uncomfortable moments.  But has it been addressed?  Yeah.  How come it's not fixed?  I don't know.  I addressed it like last week.  Because Mars was touched as a kid.  It'll take two zip ties to put on an angle over there and over there. 
[01:53:00]  No, the reason is because Mars is a little distracted because on the after show yesterday, Mars basically...  No, he said that Hispanics are known for touching their kids.  Thank God he's Hispanic so he can say shit like that.  Mars, what did you say in the after show?  Because these guys missed it.  Well, first let me address this, the mic.  When I do it too tight so it doesn't pop up...  I don't mean that.  No, no.  Grab the mic and go like this.  Here's what guests do. 
[01:53:30]  They don't know better.  They grab the...  And that happens.  It falls out of the clip.  So I'm thinking even like a zip strip here, one here will hold it in.  It has nothing to do with the joints on it.  No problem.  Because guests, they're dummies.  They don't know where to grab the...  We know to grab like the whole mic stand or grab it like this.  But they just grab the microphone and pull it toward themselves and the whole thing comes out.  The bar goes up and they're left like idiots standing there.  Sometimes they get hit in the face. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, they get hit in the face.  I mean, sometimes it's funny depending on the guest.  But, you know.  I'll certainly take care of it.  And tell these guys, you think Hispanics touch their kids and you're Hispanic.  So you're allowed to say that.  Yeah, is that what they do a lot?  There's a lot of it in the Hispanic community.  Hispanic community.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  It bothers the fuck out of me, though.  Were you touched?  I was not touched.  But I've seen.  But he's seen it enough in his circle.  And your family?  Maybe your family's twisted and demanded. 
[01:54:30]  It's outside of my family as well.  I mean, even Roland also advocated that it does happen.  But Roland said he wasn't touched.  So where's his...  Oh, he did say he...  Advocated for him.  He had some uncles he had to stay away from.  Yeah.  Remember that?  I think that was more of a joke on Roland's part.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was...  I think it was...  Now, what happens?  Is it...  What?  Male?  Older male on younger female?  Is that what goes on?  Yes.  I see that.  Who touched you?  No one touched me.  Oh.  Who showed you something I should have showed you? 
[01:55:00]  Someone showed you something.  Who showed you?  Yeah, why are you denying it?  What did they show you?  Was it dirty pictures?  Or was it a...  No, no one showed me.  I've just seen...  I've just...  Hey, you have a friend.  What have you seen?  Hey, you have a friend.  What have you seen?  What does that mean?  Yeah, why don't you fucking pee standing up like the rest of us?  Thanks for reminding me, Sam.  Oh, shit.  I didn't remember.  Are you pee sitting down?  Yeah, he does.  Oh, that speaks volumes.  Like a bitch?  Like a bitch.  Oh, you pee like a bitch?  He's like a bitch.  That speaks volumes.  Well, how do you pee?  Did I pee standing up? 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  But when he's shitting, he doesn't piss.  Like, he'll take a shit...  That's weird.  And then he'll wipe and he'll walk to the urinal to piss.  What?  Because he don't piss like a bitch.  Wait, you don't pee in the toilet where you shit?  That's psychotic.  He doesn't pee sitting down.  Everyone does that.  Oh, you don't pee sitting down.  You have to.  You actually...  You're holding in...  That's a weird control thing.  Oh, man.  Oh, he was molested.  That's a fucking...  That's a control thing.  If you're sitting on the ball, why wouldn't you do both?  That's a weird control thing.  I don't know.  Since a kid, I never did like it.  It feels funny.  Oh, it's from the touching. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Why do you need to control...  He don't want to be a bitch.  You're adding too many steps.  He was treated maybe like...  Oh, so he doesn't pee like a bitch.  He's not going to pee like a bitch.  No.  We pee like bitches.  Yeah.  White boys.  Oh, wow.  That's completely different.  Yeah, white boys pee like bitches on this.  Sitting down.  I don't know.  It's just this show.  Well, Sam started it.  Not you, Anthony.  It was fucking Sam over here.  Well, I'm white, so I can say white guys pee like bitches.  Like you say Hispanics get touched when they're kids.  I think yours was a little worse.  Ooh.  Kill yourself, Sam. 
[01:56:30]  Julia from Cape Cod.  She wants to maybe reiterate or back up the claims.  All right.  Marzie?  Yes, sir?  Marzie.  We got Julia on the phone.  Hi, Julia.  Julia.  Julia.  Julia.  Can we hear that?  Julia.  Well, it's better than me calling you.  Good evening.  Hi, Julia.  Go ahead, Julia.  Sorry, just getting all this stuff out of there.  What part of Cape Cod and how far are you from Fag Town? 
[01:57:00]  Ooh.  I am not that far from Fag Town.  I'm in Wellfleet.  Oh.  So it's just a little bit south.  Oh.  But I wanted to mention that, yeah, Hispanic people touch the kids a lot.  And I think it has to do with the sexualization of kids at a really young age.  They put them in those little whore outfits when they're like three.  Those little fucking Carnival outfits.  Hey, my friend, my friend, Hector's not going to like this.  Pack of lies.  Ah, yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Hold on, Julia.  Hold on, Julia.  This is for you.  This is for you.  We got a song for you.  Okay.  This is the best.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The white glove in case the vagina gets on his fingers.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Oh, everybody.  Everybody.  Ch-ch-ch-chulia.  You're out in trouble for a world.  Whoa.  Got me calling on the floor. 
[01:58:00]  Got me crying out for my world.  Whoa.  So much hatred for a bad boy like me.  So bad.  I have a theory.  Maybe we should do this.  Oh, you have a theory?  I have a theory that his father was happy to...  This is just a guess.  Oh, yeah.  My theory is that his father bankrolled this whole thing.  Yeah.  Because he had suspicions about his son.  Perhaps, sure.  And he's like, please, show interest in a girl.  Yeah.  I'll pay for it. 
[01:58:30]  Whatever you want to do.  I need a video packed with girls.  My friends are asking questions.  Change it from Julio to Julia.  And I'll pay for the video.  He's whining.  It looks...  And he filmed it in Beverly Hills, it looks like, right?  Yeah.  Do you think these people went to the...  Dude, this video had to cost a million dollars.  Yeah, yeah.  It has the look of any other really nice video you've seen on MTV. 
[01:59:00]  It's got girls.  It's got a lighting director, a DP, double penetration.  Rented a Rolls Royce, I believe.  Yeah, Rolls.  Beverly Hills.  That's probably his father if I owned it.  Don't spoil the end where he's the Rolls Royce driver.  Look, he's around all these hot girls.  Damn.  Julio.  Duncan Chilapa.  Whoa. 
[01:59:30]  On the floor.  Evermore.  Got me crying evermore.  Out for more.  Oh, out for more.  Got me crying.  Out for more.  I got you.  All right.  Julian Cape Cod, that was for you.  So you want to back up Mars' Hispanics touching their children thing.  Yeah.  How do you know this?  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, because, you know, just like black men have large tenises, we know that, you know,  Spanish men tend to, you know, diddle their children because they sexualize them at such 
[02:00:00]  a young age, like, you see them walking around those little mini scripts and they're like  two and their ears get pierced.  The Hoochie Mom outfits.  Ah.  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you something, Julia, you're uncontrollable.  You sure are.  Whoa!  I've never heard that song before.  And you'll never hear it again.  Thank God.  What a bomb.  Well, thanks for the info.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Back that up. 
[02:00:30]  Did Mars have, like, a Hispanic Uncle Paul?  There was Uncle Paulo.  Uncle Paulo.  To get personal.  Sure.  In my family, there were three.  Three funny uncles.  Three girls.  Three uncles that needed to stay away from.  Really?  And none of them got to you, huh?  None of them got to you.  One is dead already.  Wait, uncles through marriage or the bloodline?  Bloodline.  Oh, man.  And everybody knew it?  Wait, so whose brother? 
[02:01:00]  Whose brothers?  Your dad's brothers or your mom's brothers?  Mom's brothers.  Mom's brothers.  Did he know that at the time when it was happening?  After the fact.  You got touched.  You know what?  I remember.  I forgot.  It explains the MMA shit and everything else.  I remember when me and...  This guy's never going to be touched again, right, Mars?  Me and Hector were talking and he kept saying, hey, Mars, let me show you Uranus.  Oh, no.  Hey, Mars.  Under the guise that it's a planet, I bet.  A planet.  Yeah.  Look at the two little moons in the sack. 
[02:01:30]  You juggle those little moons in the sack.  How do the uncles get you in the shed?  Yeah, what do they do?  Do they say, hey, you want to look at some hubcaps?  Oh.  In the back of that landscaping truck with all that grass blowing around, no one could see.  Yeah.  Every time he sees mulch, he gets a heart on and throws up when he smells a little mulch.  Mars, that's why you're an MMA guy.  Yeah.  You're not going to be touched ever again. 
[02:02:00]  This is basic psychology.  Pure control.  Sitting, not pissing.  Or psychiatry.  Whatever the one is.  The one that talks and the other one is the drugs.  I never know the difference, but go.  Psychiatrists can do drugs.  They're like doctors.  Psychology is like therapist shit?  Right.  Yeah, psychiatrists are doctors.  Gotcha.  So it's psychology 101.  I think he doesn't like sitting down to take a piss even when he's taking a dump because  maybe when he was younger, he was treated like a girl.  A girl, sure.  And now he doesn't want to do anything girlish.  Dressed up pretty.  Because he don't pee like a bitch.  Bitch.  That's it. 
[02:02:30]  I ain't being a bitch again.  Maybe you're right about that.  Oh, shit.  Now you're right.  Anthony, now that you say that.  Yeah.  Maybe my father was a little too fucking strict on being macho.  Hey, don't you be no bitch.  Why didn't your father beat the shit out of the uncles?  They didn't know about this stuff.  Instead of allowing them to touch you.  It was their little...  No one touched me.  It was their little El Secret-O.  No one touched me.  I tried to throw it.  I tried to throw that beat by him. 
[02:03:00]  I know.  I saw that.  It didn't work.  And I'll tell you why no one touched me.  Because my father was a bodybuilder.  He was a big fucking dude.  Was he?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  A professional bodybuilder.  What was that about?  Maybe he was gay.  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  I wasn't there all the time.  He's telling the whole clan down the river.  What the fuck?  We should bring him in.  Okay.  Who?  Stephen Wright's here already?  Oh, he's here.  She's bringing him in.  He's 8.30.  Oh, I thought he was later.  No problem.  Yeah, tell me.  Bring him in, Roland.  We can get hard on. 
[02:03:30]  Let's talk about Mars in a little bit.  Bring him in, Roland.  Another Boomer in Jersey.  Boomer.  Yeah.  Hey, Boomer.  Hey, it's true.  I married a Puerto Rican girl from an all-white town and never dealt with Puerto Rican people  before.  And I have two daughters.  She has a couple of uncles that nobody, they're known for touching kids.  My daughters were never allowed to be around them.  Anytime they showed up at a barbecue, my wife would not show up with the kids because 
[02:04:00]  it's known in the family that these guys have touched kids in the family and they don't  rat them out.  All right, the phones are lit in.  It's amazing.  All right, we're going to continue with this topic.  Stephen Wright's making his way into the studio.  Jeff on Long Island reminding us that it was almost touched by a Mexican.  That is true.  So we might have to go back to this subject after Stephen Wright.  Yes, yes.  For the first time in our studio, Stephen Wright.  There it is.  Stephen, how are you, sir?  How you doing?  Anthony.  There you go. 
[02:04:30]  What's up, man?  Opie.  Great to meet you finally.  You going through the handshake thing?  Or is it because you have coffee and stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like touching people either.  Yeah, I'm not a...  I don't like shaking hands anymore.  I just washed.  I feel good about myself.  You just stopped a few years ago?  Yeah.  Too many had it with the greasy hands?  Too many, like, greasy-handed fans and...  Yeah.  It just feels like a peach for you today.  Come sit down, Stephen.  Yeah, you take...  How you doing, man?  Good to see you, buddy.  The immortal Jim Norton. 
[02:05:00]  Fucking Stephen Wright in the studio.  This is cool, man.  We've been fans forever.  We've been trying to get you on the show probably for a decade.  Yeah.  And finally happened.  Yeah, I think so.  It just never kind of worked out.  That's all.  Boston fan.  What's your name?  Sam.  That's young Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  What a cool name.  Yeah, it is kind of a cool name.  He's not a cool person.  Yeah.  But it is a cool name.  You're wearing the Red Sox hat.  Obviously a Boston guy.  But are you a Bruins fan? 
[02:05:30]  I hadn't watched the Bruins since the Bobby Orr days.  That's a lot of people...  That's happened to a lot of people like my age.  They came up after Bobby Orr.  You know, I'd see like a part of a game over the years.  Maybe not even a whole period.  And then about five weeks ago, I don't know why, I just tuned in like, oh, let me see  what's going on here.  And I watched the game and I was like, wow, this is pretty intense.  This is amazing.  The back and forth.  It was like incredible. 
[02:06:00]  And I got caught up in it.  So I've been watching it like for five weeks.  So my timing was just...  Perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You didn't have to sit through all the early...  39 years.  Yeah.  39 years and you tuned in.  That's the perfect time.  That is true.  As they're making their run.  Yeah.  Who needed those 39 years when the last five weeks were great?  Wow.  That is great timing.  Jesus.  You saved yourself a lot of heartache.  Oh, boy, did you.  A couple decades worth.  You're doing...  Stan, I was happy to see... 
[02:06:30]  Stephen's in promoting the Newport Yachting Center, July the 21st.  It's a 730 show at Middletown, Rhode Island, newportcomedy.com.  Or if you're just one of the old school phone guys, just go 800-745-3000.  And have you been doing stand-up all along or did you take a break and go back to it?  No, I do it like off and on throughout the year.  I never take like a...  No, don't do it at all.  I do it scattered throughout the year.  Oh, okay.  When you get the...  When you get the urge to? 
[02:07:00]  Well, no.  You know, it has to be lined up in advance.  But it's like, you know, like, okay, I want to do a certain amount of shows and have this  time off and do it.  I do a bunch of them.  Then I don't do it.  Then I'll do one.  And then I won't do it.  Then I'll do like eight of them.  Then I won't...  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And that's been since, like, the 80s?  Yeah, since about...  Wow.  ...82.  Jesus Christ, just torn around like that.  He came out of Boston with all the guys, man.  Oh, yeah.  Why was Boston so hot for comics in the 80s? 
[02:07:30]  There's some heavyweights that came out of there.  At the same time as Steve.  A lot of great comedians.  Well, Leno's before that, though, right?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit of years before.  But Stephen, Leary, Conan...  I mean, Conan's not a stand-up, but he's from...  There's a shitload of guys from Boston.  I saw a great documentary on Boston Comics, and then Stephen Wright was the first one  to break out and go to L.A. and be on Carson, right, at the time?  Yeah.  1982.  The documentary was when stand-up stood out.  Yeah, it's a great documentary, because all these guys were kind of doing their thing 
[02:08:00]  in Boston, and he was the first one to get the call.  And then after that, they kind of followed Stephen Wright.  I don't know why that all those people...  I don't know why that happened like that.  Yeah, some kind of magic.  It was just like...  Well, who'd you come up with?  Jimmy mentioned a bunch of them.  There's Dennis Leary.  Paula Poundstone.  Paula Poundstone.  Kevin Meaney.  Bobcat Goldthwait.  Wow.  I forgot someone big out of Boston, too.  I know...  Lenny Clark.  Right.  Oh, Lenny, yeah. 
[02:08:30]  We love Lenny.  He does the show.  Oh, he does?  He's a riot.  He's from another planet.  He's a riot.  Oh, Louie.  You're before Louie, though.  Louie's probably a few years after you.  Louis C.K.  Yeah, Louie was after, I think, but...  Nick DiPaolo.  I think also after you.  Nick is probably late 80s, early 90s.  Nick's angry.  Oh, Nick is...  Nick.  Nick is Boston.  Yeah.  He's the greatest.  You know Nick, right?  Oh, he's great.  If Boston had a face, it would be Nick going, what the fuck do you want?  Were you doing comedy?  I've read a lot about it.  You were doing comedy for 10 months before you did The Tonight Show? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, no.  Three years.  Oh, it was three...  See, you read all these bullshit facts.  10 months would be like, holy shit.  That didn't seem right to me, but I was like, well, it's acting right for The Tonight Show.  It's very clean.  It's a lot of stuff.  Okay, three years.  That makes me feel a little bit better.  Three years still is like...  It had to be a little nerve-wracking, though.  Because, God damn, especially then it was Carson, you know?  It was surreal.  It was surrealistic.  I mean, I wanted to go on there.  Like, that's why I wanted to do this, to maybe someday go on there.  Yeah.  When I got it in my head when I was 15. 
[02:09:30]  So then, like, doing in the clubs, and then, like, Peter LaSalle came to Boston.  He was the producer of The Tonight Show.  He came to look at colleges for his kids.  Oh, jeez.  God.  Wow, what a stroke of work.  In the summer of 82.  And someone wrote an article.  There was a club called the Ding Ho Comedy Club.  It was half Chinese restaurant, half...  That was in the movie, right?  Yeah, it was in the movie, right.  Someone wrote an article about it, and it went in the L.A. Times.  So he had that club in his head.  So then months, I don't know how much long, later, eight months later, when he came to Boston, 
[02:10:00]  he remembered the club, and he wanted to go in the club.  And then he saw me in there, and three weeks later, I was on The Tonight Show.  Oh, wow.  It was like a fairy tale.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you know he was there?  Yeah.  Oh, you knew he was there.  So you did your smart or good set.  And that was when there was only three, maybe four channels.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Now you're on TV.  It's cool and all, but back then, 1982, going on Carson.  Yeah, a lot of people were watching you.  That means overnight success, obviously. 
[02:10:30]  You go from no one knowing your name to everyone the next day.  Yeah, that changed my career, my whole life.  Sure.  What happened?  That one, like, in eight minutes.  One lousy eight-minute set.  I think that can happen now, because it's so much.  It's hard.  It's a lot harder.  What happened with me?  After you did your Tonight Show, the next day, was it like wherever you wanted people  had seen you on the show?  Because I know immediately back then, things were just different.  Yeah.  Especially if he, like, called you over or if he acknowledged that he enjoyed you. 
[02:11:00]  It was a couple of days later.  I was in Dodger Stadium watching a game, and it's the first time I ever got recognized.  It was like three days later.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was pretty nice.  Yeah.  It's a weird feeling, right?  Yeah, it is.  And then he's like, get the hell away from me.  First time you're ever recognizing you.  Just, hey, come on.  I'm trying to have a moment here.  No, you talk to people.  When they first start recognizing you, you really talk to them.  Like, oh, thanks a lot.  Were you home with your friends?  You know, you ask a lot of questions.  Stay a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Where are you going? 
[02:11:30]  Two years later, you're like, oh, why don't you just throw yourself into a fucking ditch?  You saw the show.  Drop dead.  Thanks.  Fucking trying to eat.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  I love it.  So we've heard.  Too true, though.  Yeah.  After a while, it gets a little, you know.  That's what we were talking about.  Yeah, we were talking about, you know, just even something like shaking hands.  We would do these events, and you realize by the 50th person, you're just, ugh, how many clammy, fish-belly hands can you shake without? 
[02:12:00]  And then you have that horrifying moment where you get done, and you're just tired, and you don't realize, like, you're eating a slice of pizza and went, shit, I didn't watch.  Ah, I ate it already.  Hope no one had hep.  Yeah, yeah, you just don't know what the hell you'd throw in your mouth.  But we love them.  We love them every single one of them.  Oh, yeah, every single one of them. 
[02:12:30]  Love them all.  I stopped touching my face while I'm working out, because I realized, like, I'm on the elliptical, and it's like people's-  You must be able to touch your face all the time.  See?  I'm implying you don't work out.  Because I have man tits.  Yeah, you're right.  You're correct.  I'm right.  But no, man, you start, your hands are on the thing, and you're like, I didn't even wipe this down first.  I'm fucking, like, you know, touching my nose or, like, scratching my-  Itching everything, right?  Yeah.  It does make you a little germy, kind of, you know, you kind of get a little, because you deal with too many people.  I wish I didn't have it, like, I wish I wasn't aware, like, of it. 
[02:13:00]  Is it, like, an issue, like, a big issue with you, or is it just kind of a, I'd rather not?  I'd rather not.  You know, it just creeps in over the years.  Yeah.  You know, those TV shows, when they investigate murders and stuff, and they're going through the room with the light, the blue light, and all the scum is all over.  Well, this isn't scum, but it's not his scum.  This is someone else.  This wasn't involved in the murder, but look at this, Frank.  And then it's like, you know, little tiny things.  And it's like, well, wait a minute. 
[02:13:30]  That's, you know, that seeps in.  These shows seep in.  You start thinking about it.  Now, you obviously stay at a lot of hotels, so that's, is that a nightmare for you?  It's not a nightmare, but your brain, my brain, has little, like, things so I can function.  Yeah.  You can't think of everything.  Like, you were thinking of the equipment.  I think of the exercise equipment.  I ride an exercise bike, so I'm super aware of when I'm in there doing that.  But the hotel room, I got a block, you know, part of my brain, they shut down the fuses. 
[02:14:00]  It's like, do not think of this, this, this, this, this, this, otherwise you can't go anywhere.  You mean you don't roll up in the bedspread as soon as you get to your room?  Bring my own sheets.  You know they don't wash those things ever.  Oh, the bedspreads?  Oh, man.  Yes, because when they do the...  Why would they wash those?  Yeah, they do the sheets and stuff, but the bedspread, I bet you they have a protocol once a year.  Yeah, I'm not touching the bedspread.  They do a bedspread run.  Stephen's head is in his hands right now. 
[02:14:30]  Sorry.  Oh, no, when they investigated Mike Tyson, remember when he was used in rape?  Yeah.  They went in, and I can't believe I know this.  It's all right.  They found sperm on the bedspread, but it wasn't his.  Oh, exactly.  So then that sticks my...  So from then on, bedspreads would, like, as soon as I go in, I just...  Yeah, peel it off.  Not that it's going to do anything.  Sperm's not going to hurt you, is it, Jim?  Probably not, no.  I hate when I get in the eye, because that doesn't give you a pink eye, believe me. 
[02:15:00]  I showed up a tough crowd once my eye was red, and someone's like, what happened?  I'm like, if you want a real answer, I'll give it to you, and I'm not going to like it.  You're not going to like the answer.  Yeah, that's why they call me the distance kid.  The distance kid.  Oh, yeah.  What gets me in hotels is the TV remote.  Because I know, personally, I've had, you know, relations in a hotel room, and then  you just kind of roll over, and you were, you know, your hands were everywhere. 
[02:15:30]  First thing you do is grab the remote.  And then you're grabbing the remote, you're changing channels.  That's the...  That's the worst thing.  Of the whole room?  Right.  That's...  Because everyone's touching it.  It's a known thing.  It's not my opinion.  That's the worst thing in the whole room.  Yeah, the worst thing.  That remote probably lights up like a Peter Maxx painting when they put the black light  on it.  Do you know, hotels, they also clean a lot, too.  But that's only the areas you're going to like, you know, the faucet.  They do more cleaning than probably most people, too, because every day there's a computer made  and they're washing.  But I'm like, Stephen, I block it out, like, because it could drive you crazy, but then 
[02:16:00]  I'm like, you know what?  Yeah, you just can't think about it.  I fucked so many times without a rubber.  Eh, fuck it.  What can I possibly get that I don't have already?  I think we're making our guest a little uncomfortable.  No, he's looking around the room.  He deals with this.  It's great because, yeah, you have to deal with it.  And you're able to, which is good.  It's not like, you know, well, I stay in a trailer or I have a truck bring me places  like John Madden, have it scrubbed down wherever you go. 
[02:16:30]  He's reaching for tissues.  Why don't we move on?  I don't even know.  Subconscious.  I don't even know why I was doing it.  Just let me hold this.  Let me hold this.  I might need it.  But it's an interesting psychology because we all have it to a certain degree.  Yes.  It's where your line is.  Like Howie, Howie Mandel is like, he's the go-to guy.  Like, well, I'm not as bad as how, like when you're drinking and drugging, you're like,  well, I'm not as bad as that guy.  Howie is the germ guy.  It's driving him nuts.  Howie's having a tough time with that. 
[02:17:00]  Last time he was in here, he was telling us he was having a tough time with that.  And he's open about it and he talks about it.  It's just, it's hard because once you get something in your head, man, it's fucking,  you know who got me started on it?  Rich Voss.  Oh.  Rich Voss got me started.  I don't shake hands.  And I shake hands.  It's like no one wants to shake your hand, Rich.  But he has horrible little rock hands.  They are like, he doesn't want human interaction at all.  Right.  I didn't realize with Rich, it's obviously, it's a long line of rapes.  You can't touch this guy.  Yeah, I'm sure he's suffered many.  As soon as you touch him, he just gets all like, ah. 
[02:17:30]  He gets really uncomfortable.  That's great.  What do you mean he has rock hands?  Oh, his hands are, like, he has small gargoyle hands.  They're really unpleasant visually and they feel terrible.  They're not nice hands to touch.  He plays a lot of golf, so he has those really thick over-the-top calluses.  They're the hands of a dummy.  Like, if you've ever seen what a dummy's hands should feel like, they're Voss.  The hands of a working man.  Oh, absolutely.  I wouldn't be happy if he wouldn't find out about it.  I would like people to Twitter Voss.  He has dumb, I told him his hands are like turtle feet. 
[02:18:00]  What can he do about it?  Nothing.  He has to lose his feet.  He's doomed.  Oh, yeah.  Do you know Voss?  Oh, he's a comedian.  He's a buddy of mine.  Okay.  Rich is right now going, ah, she knows me.  We met one time.  Shut up.  No one remembers you.  Hey, how was it winning an Oscar?  I think Stephen Wright might be the first Oscar winner in our studio.  Ooh.  Oh, really?  I'm trying to think.  You might be right.  I think you're the only one, sir.  We've been doing this a long time.  1989, right?  Dreyfuss never won one? 
[02:18:30]  Did Dreyfuss win?  He was in, yeah, an XM.  I remember.  Yeah, Richard was in there.  Did he ever win, though?  I don't know.  I love him.  Yeah, isn't he great?  He's funny.  But you have an Oscar, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Where is that Oscar right now?  It's on a table in my house, in my living room.  Nice.  Was that 89?  That was way after.  Was it eight after that?  Because I remember Barry Katz's best short film, 1989.  Oh, it was.  Okay, Barry Katz told me that for some reason.  Yeah.  Well, that was incredibly weird because we made a film for HBO.  We didn't even make it to go in the theater. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, we went in there to see if we could make a half-an-hour movie, and they said, yeah,  and then we wrote it.  And me and my friend Mike Armstrong wrote it, and Dean Parasso directed it.  And then we gave it to them, and they liked it a lot, so then they played it in the theaters.  Wow.  And if it plays in New York or L.A., then it's eligible.  And then it was nominated, and then it won.  We didn't even make it.  We made it, you know, it was like throwing a dart.  This thing was called The Appointments of Dennis Jennings. 
[02:19:30]  It was like throwing that to HBO, and a big gust of wind blew it 50 miles to the right,  and it went, where'd it go?  Oh, it's stuck in over there.  Oh, that Oscar.  That is amazing.  Yeah, it really is.  It's surrealistic.  How long of the film is it?  20?  30 minutes.  Oh, 30 minutes?  And when they call the name, do you just go like, I can't, I won this.  What happened?  It's weird, like it's happening, but it's not happening.  Yeah.  And me and the director went up, and I said, this is for the short film category, 
[02:20:00]  and we're really glad now that we cut out the other 60 minutes.  There's your Steve Ryan right there.  Perfect, man.  That must have gotten a massive laugh.  That is very funny.  Dreyfuss did win for Goodbye Girl, the Goodbye Girl 1977.  I would have thought it was for Mr. Holland's Opus.  Nominated.  And someone's saying Sinbad won an Oscar?  Get the fuck out of here.  What did he win for?  They're just fucking around now.  Yeah, they have to be.  They have to be.  Have you guys known each other before the show? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, kind of.  I used to come on a show.  I was in construction for many years.  I never did radio or anything.  And then I was doing song parodies and stuff.  So I sent a few.  It was during the O.J. Simpson thing.  Yeah, we didn't really.  Sent it into his show, and he played it.  The fans liked it.  He invited me in to do it live.  And then we just started talking.  And it was like, oh, great.  We left my tools.  We left my tools.  We left my tools.  Wow.  And then we went up to Massachusetts to do radio at WAAF.  And I just threw my tools out the window. 
[02:21:00]  My sheet metal worker tools out the window.  And I thought, I could always buy new ones if I fall on my ass.  It is weird we're doing a radio show with Pete.  Because O.J. killed those people, though.  Yeah.  It's kind of strange.  That's the only reason we got together.  If O.J. didn't commit those heinous crimes.  That is the truth.  I don't know if we would have met if O.J. would have been an addict.  Because O.J. had to kill the people.  That made him go, I'm going to write a song about it.  I heard about the song.  I played the song.  And that's why we're doing radio.  Do you know, if you ever meet O.J., if you ever meet Denise, Nicole Sistine, you should 
[02:21:30]  say, do I have a story for you?  But think lemons and lemonade.  Yes.  But how else do we think of the good that came of it?  We wouldn't have met.  It was just one of those chance things.  Wow.  And 17 years later, we're still doing this.  Was your show in a year?  Oh, no.  This goes back to it.  Long Island.  Long Island.  Then you went together as a boss.  Yeah.  How long did you go to Boston?  Three years, about.  And then we got fired.  We were the mayor, guys.  Saying the mayor, Menino, died.  In a car accident.  Got in trouble.  Yeah.  That was great.  We were those guys. 
[02:22:00]  Ooh.  We were wacky.  We were wacky.  Look out.  Yeah.  We were those guys.  And then they rewarded us.  Man, did they run us out of town.  They rewarded us by giving us a higher-paying job right here back in New York City.  So, hey, great.  And that wasn't good enough for us, so we fucked that gig up.  Yeah.  We fucked that up and then got a better job.  I came on around.  That's great.  I came around about $2,000.  Here's how, when they fucked the gig up.  In here?  No, this was at WNEW.  It was an afternoon drive show.  Yeah, on regular, standard radio.  I was paying $300 a month to live with a comedian named Jim Florentine in Jersey and his girlfriend. 
[02:22:30]  So it was a $900 rent split three ways.  I say, fuck it.  I'm going to move into New York.  So I'm on the radio every day.  I pick up a rent that is seven times higher.  Seven times higher.  A $2,200 a month rent.  And five months later, we're off the air.  I have a two-year lease.  You've never seen a panic-stricken fucking person.  Whoops.  27, yeah, five months later.  I wonder you were blowing Colin. 
[02:23:00]  I couldn't have thrown you guys under the bus faster for Colin when the crowd came around.  I was like, oh, fuck those guys.  Come on, Colin.  Okay.  Reservoir Dogs, it's so cool, too, every time I watch you, because we've had Mads here.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a part of an amazing cult.  I love to see comedians in places like that.  It kind of gives you hope.  Yeah, yeah.  That is, you don't realize how huge of a part that is in that movie to set the mood.  You know, it's Steeler's Wheel. 
[02:23:30]  You announcing Steeler's Wheel.  I still think when I hear that song, I think of that scene.  I think everyone thinks that.  How could he not at this point?  And I'm glad you're here, because I could ask, whose idea was it to say behemoth?  Well, I did like one or two takes of each thing, and I stumbled on that one, and I did it again to make it right, but he chose that one.  It's so funny.  It's like, behemoth, you know, and the way it goes, behemoth. 
[02:24:00]  It gets me every time.  It works.  I was lucky to get in there, because the woman who edited his movie, Sally Menke, she edited the Dennis Jennings movie that I made.  So the whole movie was almost done, like, Reservoir Dogs was almost done, but he didn't have the voice.  He knew the guy was going to be on the radio, but he didn't have the voice.  And she suggested me, and he liked the idea, so that's how it happened.  So what you're saying is you're the luckiest guy in show business.  That's pretty much what I'm getting from this.  There's a lot of lucky stories here. 
[02:24:30]  That's true.  It's another dart being thrown somewhere.  Just say, because I'm talented.  Enough of the lucky stories.  He's had some amazing, really good luck, doesn't he?  Oh, yeah, he has.  It is, obviously, a talent.  I have, really.  I know that, too.  I know.  Now, you're a brilliant comic, Stephen Wright.  Yeah, everybody.  But a lot of it is Right Place, Right Time, too.  It's nice to get it.  That's with anything, man.  Of course.  Yeah, but you've got to be able to back it up.  You know, I've seen people get lucky, and then it's like, oh, damn, they suck.  That's right.  But stand-up is such a...  Like, I watched recently with the HBO... 
[02:25:00]  What was the Young Comedians thing you did?  It was, I think, at Catch in New York.  They filmed it.  Yeah, when Alan King is the host.  The host, yeah.  Oh, wow, yeah.  That was in 82.  Stephen, from that.  I used to watch those when I was younger.  I used to watch those all the time.  And to see a stand-up being so opposite with everybody else, because everybody, especially  in the early 80s, was fucking high energy and crazy.  And then to come out and just silence people and make them listen to that, that was really  a ballsy...  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to have a lot of confidence in your material when you're pretty much just 
[02:25:30]  monotone and quiet.  But I didn't know how to do it another way.  You know, it wasn't like, well, I'll do this.  You know, it was just my only...  I know what you're saying.  Yeah.  I know your angle on that.  But I didn't know how to do it any other way.  And in the early days, when there was a lot of talking in the audience, hecklers and stuff,  noise, you know, when the place is noisy in the club, I would just talk softer.  And it would quiet the room down, because I was talking even lower than I normally did. 
[02:26:00]  Because I didn't know how to, like, say, wisecrack things, interact, like a guy off...  Like Lenny would.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, just bash a heckler or something.  I didn't know what to do.  That's a great idea, though, because that obviously would force the people to shut the  hell up and...  It worked.  I don't know why it worked.  They could have just talked even more or ignored me.  Yeah.  Somehow, you know, I stumbled on it by accident.  You know how you learn things by accident.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like little tiny things happen. 
[02:26:30]  And your brain goes, well, wait a minute.  I've got to remember that.  Right.  For future reference.  And this whole thing starts piling up, you know, because you're your own teacher.  You're a student and your own teacher.  So that was like, I stumbled on that.  Okay, now when that happens again, I'll talk soft.  And it's weird.  You see alternative comics.  To me, I've always thought they all want to be Steven in that, but they miss what he  does, which is has great jokes.  Like a lot of them are funny, but they want a deadpan and they want to be just, they want 
[02:27:00]  their words concentrated on them, but they forget that you have to have funny stuff to  say, too.  And not all comics, but I mean, when I watched that movement happening.  I was like, they're all trying to be Steven and they don't even know it.  But you'd go up there, not one ounce of muscling jokes, no bullshit, just stand there quietly  and fucking murder.  And it was like, there's something, he makes it look like, wow, that's got to be easy to  do.  And then you try it.  It's like, holy shit, they won't stop talking.  It's hard.  Where did that, where did that come from growing up?  I guess, did you just observe a lot of stuff and realize, wow, that's pretty strange. 
[02:27:30]  I, I could twist that around and make it funny.  I didn't really write any jokes to it.  I went, I wanted to do this, I had it in my head since I was 15.  And then I went to school and college and everything and went out west to Colorado and  California.  And I came back, my brother was getting married.  I came back in 79 because he was getting married.  When I came back, I learned, heard of the comedy connection.  I didn't even know there was a club in Boston.  And then I thought, well, I've had this in my head since I was 15. 
[02:28:00]  I better go down to the club.  This is amazing.  I don't have to go to New York or LA.  I, you know, I, I don't think I had the, the strength as a 23 year old.  I wouldn't even, I didn't have the balls to move to New York.  Leave, yeah, yeah.  I didn't have really a plan.  It was a fantasy to do this.  Right.  Well, when I came back and I heard the club was right there, I was like, well, I got to  go down and check it out.  So I went down and I watched a show and I learned that the open mic night was in two 
[02:28:30]  weeks.  So during, no, it was every week, but I decided I would go in two weeks.  And then I wrote stuff during that time to go back.  But I had never written any jokes before that.  Really?  Did you get laughs the first night?  I, I was on for about three minutes and I, and they laughed at about half of it, you  know, like in and out.  And I mean, I was so nervous.  That's one reason I had straight, I have a, you know, I have a straight face kind of anyway,  but I was, I was pet, pet, pet, you know, just like, so I was like this, like trying 
[02:29:00]  to say the, remember the joke, say the right joke.  What's next?  Just like if someone had a gun on me off stage, if you make a mistake, you're going to blow  your head off.  I don't know.  And then it just worked.  I mean, I, that's how I talk anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, uh, so Mike, you know, Mike McDonald comedian.  I know the name.  I don't know him.  Well, he was doing it already.  I went to Emerson with him and, uh, Larry was at Emerson too. 
[02:29:30]  And Mario Cantone was at Emerson.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  I'm going to see him tonight.  And Caroline's.  Oh, is he, but you're doing Caroline's?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, he's amazing.  What a mind he has.  Jeez.  So, uh, I found what I saw.  Oh, Mike, I came off and I was very disappointed.  I didn't, they didn't, I thought, oh, that was horrible.  They didn't laugh at everything.  But out of innocence.  Yeah.  Out of not knowing.  And Mike said, look, you never even did it ever in your life. 
[02:30:00]  And they laughed at half of it.  So rip out the stuff that didn't work and write other stuff and put it in and then come back.  And so when I left from him saying that to me, I've said that this many times over the years,  I left the place seeing it like a positive experience rather than like, oh, shit, that  sucked.  Right.  And I leave the place and I'm going, I can't believe it.  They laughed at something I made up.  I can't, I can't, I absolutely can't believe it.  And then, then I kept going back. 
[02:30:30]  So he had a big impact on me.  That one guy being nice to you.  It is weird how that can make or break you.  Yeah.  If somebody else came up and went, you sucked.  There are stories about that.  Don't quit your day job.  Yeah.  Great.  Thanks.  Thanks for the support.  Another comedian.  It is nice when somebody in the business, because, you know, people can be very cutthroat, but  sees a guy who's young and it's like, hey, he's funny.  And, and just tells you something that they don't, people don't realize what an impact  that really, I always try to be nice to, to younger comics.  Um, because I remember like when people were nice to me and talk to me, like I meant something, 
[02:31:00]  it's fun.  It was an incredibly, if they would have, if they would have let me know I was not going  to be in their club, I never would have come back.  If they would have let me know, like, you're not going to be a part of this ever, but they  were very welcoming.  Most comics were pretty good.  Did you, did you love it?  Like right from that first time, even though you were nervous when you got off stage, were you  just thinking, I want to do that again?  I knew I wanted to do it again.  I don't know if I said, I guess I love it.  I didn't think that I loved it.  I loved the idea that I was 23 and I had it in my head to be a comedian since I was 15. 
[02:31:30]  So what is that?  Like eight years.  I thought eight years, it was in a concept.  And then that night they laughed at a joke I made up.  So that was like a turning point.  That was like, geez.  Where do you think you were headed if it wasn't for comedy?  What would you do?  Well, I went to Emerson for mass communication doing radio.  Oh, okay.  I thought if I could be funny on the radio, I would somehow get to stand up. 
[02:32:00]  But I didn't know how.  Whoops.  Mistake.  He's got...  You're a busy guy today.  I mean, the Stanley Cup is a block away from here and I hear you're going to be going down  there and hoisting it or something?  No, I'm not hoisting it.  What happened?  I'm not going to hoist this thing.  I'm not touching that.  I'd like to hang out longer.  Oh, good.  Yes.  Yeah, your guys are telling you.  Absolutely.  Oh, no problem then.  I go in to get this coffee on the way here and the woman comes in with a Bruins hat and 
[02:32:30]  she sees my Red Sox hat.  Oh, did you see the series?  Oh, I'm going to see the Stanley Cup.  What?  I'm going to see the Stanley Cup.  It's on 47th and 6th.  She said, that's why I'm here.  So then I'm thinking, oh, my God.  I can do the show and then go down there and see.  It's unbelievable.  And I was telling Pam that this wouldn't have happened.  I live in Carlisle, Massachusetts.  If I went in a Dunkin' Donuts this morning to get a coffee, oh, the Stanley Cup is going 
[02:33:00]  to be down the street.  In Carlisle.  Yeah.  With three of the players.  Right.  Three of the players are going to be there, too.  Wait, another lucky fucking striker thing right now.  You're going to be self-conscious.  I'm going to kill myself.  It's all his luck.  Everything he does, he looks into.  Jesus Christ.  You know, now I have to say, you're not brilliant, sir.  Oh, my God.  You know, the funny thing is, they usually bring the Stanley Cup in here, but this year,  for some reason, they passed us by, man.  Usually, we have it right in front of you. 
[02:33:30]  You could have done both at the same time.  But you're right.  The good luck of just watching after all those years, just tuning in a few months ago, and  then he happens to show up where the Cup is.  I'm going to follow him down, because I guarantee you Spielberg is there.  Somebody is there.  Isn't that the Carson thing, because a guy decided that his kids wanted to go to college  in Boston, and he had to go to the Chinese joint?  That is fucking...  This is creepy, Steven.  That's creepy.  I'm like, you're adding it up.  Later, I'll go to kill myself, and there'll be no bullet in the chamber. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Another lucky...  Look at that.  Another lucky break.  Well, the first time you have bad luck, it's going to be really bad luck.  I hear Chachara, Thomas, and Bergeron are going to be there.  Wow.  A block away from here.  Is it a zoo down there?  Does anyone know?  I mean, you'll go to the front of the line.  Yeah.  What, is it a bar?  Is it a bar they're doing?  No, it's the NHL store.  Oh, I forgot about that.  That's a block away from here.  What was your first bad, like, really awful stage experience?  It must have been one that you were like, eek.  Because we usually have that one where we're like, am I in the right fucking job here?  Well, like, a couple of years in, during the early 80s, they would have the comedy clubs. 
[02:34:30]  But then, outside in the suburbs, like, 40 minutes away or something, they'd have comedy one night.  But it wasn't a comedy club.  Yeah.  And there was a place in Lemonster, Mass, called Scampi's.  And it was like a nightclub thing.  And that was the worst thing ever.  Because one thing I learned was that the audience should know there's going to be a show.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:35:00]  Because it was music.  It was like disco music.  People dancing.  And maybe a little sign, like this big, off to the side, where you come in and no one sees it.  And then all of a sudden, the guy, they shut the music off and the lights stop.  And a guy walks out with a microphone and puts it on the dance floor.  And then he started the show and he introduced me.  And I came out.  And it was like, it was insane.  Here's the guy that's interrupting your night.  Just blankly, it was the worst.  That was the worst. 
[02:35:30]  What about you?  Where was one of your worst?  Rascals in Ocean Township.  I was working with a guy named Bob Levy, who I loved.  He was a headliner who I used to...  I'm just staring.  I'm just making Iraq uncomfortable.  Iraq's taking pictures while Jimmy's talking.  I don't mind that.  He wasn't in for the whole interview.  And then he just comes in with his little hat and his awful fucking Lon Chaney hairdo.  Giant flash in Steven's face.  He's trying to talk to Jimmy.  No, a foot from Jimmy's face.  Yeah.  It doesn't have a zoom on it. 
[02:36:00]  But it was...  It's our idea, Iraq.  This is what we do every day, by the way, Steven.  Attack our friends.  We attack everybody, everything, ourselves.  Which is the worst.  Go ahead.  But Bobby was the host.  And I was...  Bobby was...  I used to work like the open mic in the bar area.  I never worked a big room.  And so Bob, who I really admired, was hosting, like a young talent night.  He brought me on, and I bombed.  I actually...  It's the only time I've ever walked off stage.  I was like...  It was like seven minutes in. 
[02:36:30]  You didn't finish.  Yeah.  I was like...  I actually said to the audience, am I too dirty?  And, you know...  Ooh.  And it was awful.  And some guy...  This wasn't even a good heckle.  He goes, get a new act.  Oh.  And I couldn't handle that.  I was like...  And I went, I'm sorry I wasted your time.  And I walked off.  Were you being nice?  I was just humiliated.  Yeah.  Because it was like a validation of everything I had ever thought that was negative.  Like, here it is.  Like, we knew it was coming, didn't we?  You fucking nothing.  And here it is.  And when I walked off, some guy...  I'll never forget this one guy. 
[02:37:00]  He goes, ah, you'll get it next time.  Which was a cheese dick thing to say.  You know, it's like...  Yeah.  That's great if you're a little eager.  I'm not a 21-year-old creep who's probably going to get his dick stared at in a restroom on  the way home.  You know, a parkway back in those days.  Couldn't help it.  He looked young.  But, uh...  Oh, that is brutal, though.  I think it was the night before Desert Storm happened.  Because I remember I wanted to go on the next...  I called the manager that night, the owner, Ward Magnuson.  And I'm like, I'm going to get out of the business.  He's like, oh, just soul search and see how you feel.  And that, for some reason, that just resonated with me. 
[02:37:30]  One night can make you just go, I want out.  Don't you always feel for people when they come up to you and they go, dude, I'm 35 and  I've been wanting to do that for 20 years and I just never...  And I always feel like, just do it, man.  I try it.  I always feel for guys who say they wanted to and didn't try it.  Those guys always are.  You know how horrifying stand-up is, though, for people?  Like, to be alone in front of people and think, if they don't laugh, I don't know.  The flop sweat that would come out, the fear, the fight or flight response you'd get. 
[02:38:00]  But see, you know, I didn't, I don't know about Jim, but I didn't break it down like that.  I was like, it was like, all right, I want to try doing this.  I didn't break, like what you just described, I didn't think maybe that would happen.  Really?  I knew it might, I knew it, who knows what's going to happen, but I didn't, like...  You didn't really, you didn't really break it down.  I didn't break it down, yeah.  And, but I say to people, you know, trying it, I say to people why I did it was I wanted 
[02:38:30]  to try it and either have it work or not work, but I didn't want to be doing some job like  in Wyoming or doing like an accountant in Wyoming, wondering what would have happened if I tried  it.  So that, I forced myself to do it.  Right.  Just because you, and you look back sometimes on those moments and you go, fucking thank God  God, I didn't listen to my fear or I didn't make that one turn that would have changed  everything and who knows what I'd be doing now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Watch the odds of it. 
[02:39:00]  I would have won the Powerball.  I would have bought a ticket and won 300 million.  You have no idea if you hadn't gone to the club that night.  Exactly.  If I hadn't been to fucking needy.  Maybe if Steven picked your numbers.  And maybe it didn't work out.  Maybe there was something right around the corner we missed out on.  I might have broken down on the way home and Bob De Niro might have picked me up.  Exactly.  It's like being a movie, whatever it was he would say to a young lad in purple workout  pants.  Yeah, I was going to, I actually had to talk to my dumb ex-wife, who wasn't my ex-wife 
[02:39:30]  at the time, about going up to Massachusetts to do radio.  And I was, you know, I was making probably 27,000 a year doing sheet metal work and they  offered me less than that to do radio.  It was like 26,000 to do, to do radio.  Like first, I've never done it before.  So I was just like, yeah.  What do you mean you had to talk to her about it?  Because it was my wife at the time.  So I had to then go back and be like, yeah, well, they offered me, you know, 26,000. 
[02:40:00]  Well, you should call them up and if you can't get more than what you're making now, you  just, you can't.  And I'm like, do you understand?  She didn't see the vision.  She didn't see the future.  It was obvious that this was going to lead to huge things.  And I was just a pussy because she was a nasty person.  Right.  I can't believe you're the same person.  Oh, believe me.  I can't either.  What do you mean?  No.  You just have to talk to the wife.  He doesn't talk to no wives anymore there, Steve.  Oh, it's just very, you know, okay.  He's his own person now, sir.  Hey, let's not make any waves. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Whatever you want.  We almost didn't do this thing.  And it was obvious we had something and Boston won us and they were going to give us afternoon  drive.  That's crazy.  We just started working together.  We worked together for a few months at that point, you know, here and there.  And then his wife at the time is like, eh.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  Keep me in sheet metal work.  Right.  A thousand dollar difference.  Yeah.  For a grand a year difference.  But the fork in the road.  Yeah, yeah.  It was huge.  Yeah, because he knew what he had as a sheet metal worker. 
[02:41:00]  It wasn't going to get much better than that.  Oh, believe me.  During the divorce, she was happy I made that decision.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  If she got a little more than a sheet metal worker, I would have given her.  But that's some good odds as far as gambling going.  Look at this fork, what it could lead to.  And you know what?  It's not like, ah, well, I sure gave up that sheet metal career.  I could never go back to that.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, it could always just go back.  It was a no-brainer.  Yeah, well, somebody with no brain.  There's a lot of funny people out there.  Like, are you on Twitter? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  There's a lot of...  Is this Steven Wright on Twitter?  Yeah, but it's...  Yeah.  S-T-E-V, not P-H.  So people know Steven Wright to check out on Twitter.  There's a lot of funny people out there.  Like, I laugh sometimes reading, like, show fans will write stuff.  Funny guys out there.  There's a lot of funny guys.  A lot of funny people.  And, like, what separates us from them?  I mean, maybe we're funnier or maybe we just did something that they went left and we went right.  It's like, I'm always looking at people who say, I was going to do it, but I fucking didn't do it. 
[02:42:00]  And it's like, oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're thinking of trying to try it, if you suck, so what?  The worst that can happen is you bomb.  Yeah.  What, are you going to go be a cop?  It's amazing how people will take such a dangerous job where you can get shot.  There'll be a fireman.  Like, you know, I just stayed with the fire department.  God forbid they stare at you instead of running into a burning building, you fucking lunatic.  What we do is easy compared to what you're doing.  The risk factor.  You'll be amazed how many people find it a lot scarier to just get up in front of everybody alone with a microphone. 
[02:42:30]  They'd rather run into a burning building.  That stops a lot of people going for their dreams.  They're scared.  It comes down to you, you're just scared, and there's a comfort zone that you're comfortable with, obviously, so you just kind of stay in there.  I had a fear of leaving, like, Long Island.  I was, you know, with my family was around and everything, and I just had this kind of agoraphobic thing of leaving the state.  With what you had going on back then, I don't blame you.  Oh, please.  It's up to him. 
[02:43:00]  What?  What?  The wife?  The, uh...  Oh, that one.  No, I knew that was coming.  Hey, believe me, I knew that was coming in Boston, too.  It was a central situation.  Yeah, you know.  One thing about the ex-wife, she did enjoy another female in the bed.  You know?  There's a sentence I've never heard.  They can't be all, can't be all bad, you know?  One thing about the ex-wife.  There's got to be one thing in there.  I just, I'll never forget that we were at WBAB. 
[02:43:30]  I was there for three years and met Ann at the end of the run, and we were doing some good stuff, and they threw us a going away party because we're going to Boston.  And Ann was there maybe a half hour because he had a situation he had to take care of.  There was a girl who wanted to come back.  She just, yeah, she actually said, my wife comes up to me at the time and just goes, uh, this girl, Cindy, she wants to, um, she wants to come home and watch us have sex.  And I was like, all right, chick.  Like, I am so out of there.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  How did that happen? 
[02:44:00]  They had known each other for a while.  That's a logical question.  We had all known each other.  See, he's just used to luck.  And then, wait a minute, wait a minute, and then you sprinkle some alcohol over the situation, and then have these girls just yapping with each other and getting a little, you know, intimate, I guess.  They both had this, I don't know, they both kind of were into girls kind of a thing, and, uh.  Your wife and this, they're strangers and they're talking? 
[02:44:30]  No, no, they kind of knew each other for about, I guess, I guess for, uh, not even a year, but they were kind of friendly and shit, and then it was like, oh, yeah, she, so my wife comes up to me and goes, hey, she wants to come back and watch us, you know, have sex at our house.  I'm like, okay, that sounds great by me.  I, I didn't even say goodbye to anyone.  I'm just like, ah, I gotta go, I gotta go.  I'm like, where are you going?  This is for us.  Did she just, like, sit in the room watching you?  No, it was, I, well, I was drinking at this, uh, this party.  And all I'm thinking is, I got both of them, I'm in my work van that I'm not even supposed to be driving off hours, and I'm just thinking, if I get pulled over now and get a Dewey, I, I, I, I'm just gonna kill myself. 
[02:45:00]  I, I'd have to tell the cop, like, look, I, it's, it's me or, it's me or you, officer.  If you try to arrest me, I will have to try to kill you, because I'm gonna have sex with two girls right now.  You understand, right, sir?  And he'd be, all right, go ahead.  I think there's a few officers out there.  I probably would.  I wouldn't let you off on that one. 
[02:45:30]  Uh, we got home, and it was kind of awkward, like, how you start that shit out.  So it was like, the, the girls were in the living room, and I, I'm just, I'm, I wanna get started right away.  Enough of this yapping.  Uh, so I was like, well, you know, I'm gonna, let me take a shower.  So I'm like, I jump in the shower and figure that'll get going.  And then when I pop out, they're kinda on the couch, having a little fun.  And so I just kinda jumped in with just a towel on, knowing that could come off pretty easy.  But wait a minute.  Yeah, yeah.  The woman said she wanted to watch you have sex with me. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I think that's...  But did you think you knew that meant, could mean something else?  I assumed that she...  Because I would've thought, she really, I would've, you wanna, okay.  So, I would've said, why, why are you over here?  You're gonna watch.  What are you doing?  Yeah, you're, you're fucking this whole thing up.  You're just supposed to be watching.  This was not the plan.  Don't participate.  Your toes are supposed to be behind the tape.  I'm not lying.  You know what that's about.  You're fucking up my OCD, man. 
[02:46:30]  An OCD guy.  You said watch.  Yes, there's a concept there.  Whoa, man, you're fucking me up.  You both have to jerk me off with your left hands.  Stop with the righty-lefty stuff.  It's killing me.  I knew.  That's a good concept right there.  I knew when she said watch.  I was the OCD guy.  That that meant she was gonna, you know, jump in.  Yeah, usually.  Because women don't want to admit that they're gonna jump into a threesome.  They don't want to commit to it.  Yeah, yeah.  She wanted to make sure that she could get out of it if she wanted to.  Yeah.  Like, what reason? 
[02:47:00]  Who knows?  He's creepy.  He's got an awful dick.  Yeah, it's like shopping, you know?  So, you gotta see what's going on for us.  If I'm there just belting my wife in the face.  Or if you said, hold on a second, and then you went and you took a really loud shit.  Yeah, perhaps she would have just watched or left or fled.  What a mood killer that would have been.  Yeah, that would have been.  I wasn't gonna do that.  Oh, just in the face.  Did you hear they traded and say...  One of those loud fucking... 
[02:47:30]  One of those loud echoey, no carpet in the bathroom shits?  Yeah, that would have been great.  That would have wrecked your whole vibe.  We had talked about it before.  Like, me and the wife had talked about it before, but never did it.  So this was the first time.  And I was very self-conscious of looking like I was having too much of a good time with the other girl.  Right.  Because then I didn't want to blow the whole thing up.  So I had to like...  I was having sex with the other girl, but when the other girl wasn't looking at me, I had to look at the wife and be like, you know... 
[02:48:00]  Isn't this cool?  Like, look at her lovingly.  Right.  Like, give her fake attention?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, like a little brush on the knee.  Like, yeah, yeah, that's good.  You're still in the room.  This is great.  Did you also have to look at her like you weren't enjoying the other girl as much as you really were?  Yes, I almost had to be like, ah, this is what it is.  Ah, you know what it is.  It's all old hat.  She's no you, honey.  I'm sure she sucks it down to the root, but she's no you.  I prefer your gagging, pulling hairs out of your throat. 
[02:48:30]  That was like one of the...  At some point, the wife had to get up to go to the bathroom or something.  And then the other girl just like kneels down and went down on me as I'm sitting on the couch.  And that was like the point I think I said, I just don't want to be married.  Like, I was like, this is a brand new girl.  So the wife did it to herself.  Yes, I was always saying that.  She did it to herself.  I was always saying that.  And then when the second time rolled around, and we were in New York, and I got an ultimatum. 
[02:49:00]  What second time of what?  Oh, the three girls.  With three girls.  Same girl?  No, no.  No, no, a different girl.  All right.  Yeah, that ended up being like, well, I don't, you know, you're giving this girl a lot of attention.  And then we would be, we'd wake up and Saturday morning, hung over and shit.  And the wife would always say like, you know, I don't mind this, but you know, I don't want you doing anything when I'm not around.  I'm like, yeah, that's fine.  Don't worry about it. 
[02:49:30]  So she would go into the bathroom.  And the second I'd hear the shower go on, I'm just fucking this other girl.  And then you'd hear the shower shut off.  And we'd both just put on Nickelodeon.  Your wife did it to you herself.  She did.  She was like the drug dealer.  She gave you a little taste.  Yeah, yeah, gave me a taste.  She gave you a taste.  But then the girl that was in that situation, I started kind of getting a little attached to, and she was cool and shit.  So I started kind of spending a little time with her. 
[02:50:00]  And the wife was like, look, I don't like this.  It's either me or her.  I was like, oh, the ultimatum.  Well, I'll see you in court.  That's about it.  Never try to bluff unless you know the outcome.  No, no, that was it.  That was the end of that marriage.  She didn't wonder why you were putting Vaseline in the tub and saying, honey, go in and take a shower.  It was a very odd situation.  Yeah, it was pretty odd.  How long did you stay with that girl?  With the wife?  No, the one that you...  Oh, the other one?  It was like nine years. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Nine years with the third...  With the third girl.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Did you ever have another woman?  No, that was it.  It was just me and her.  Yeah, it didn't cheat.  It's a good boy.  It didn't do anything.  Ant was a fucking good guy.  But if a girl is going to frigging dangle that in front of my face like that and say,  oh, I'd like to, you know, be cool if we could get another girl in there because I kind  of like girls.  I was like, flip, I'll have this done in a minute.  You should have hired them though.  You should have got escorts because I had a threesome with a girl one time and let's 
[02:51:00]  just say we hired...  Did he like it too?  Well, it's funny you ask that.  Maybe I watched a girlfriend one time do a little something.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but I hired somebody because...  Oh, you hired someone?  Yeah, I hired somebody because you knew...  You were dealing with you and your girlfriend?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, that wouldn't do it for me.  It did it for me because she enjoyed it and it was dirty, but I knew it was a guy and  he didn't fuck her.  It was just like, oh, I watched him play a little bit.  But I didn't want to get a regular guy because I didn't... 
[02:51:30]  A regular guy all of a sudden gets attached or whatever.  I can't imagine that part of it.  To me, this was a professional who would leave and we didn't want to hang.  It was nothing like...  I can't even believe that this girl did this.  I can't imagine that angle.  She wasn't a long-term girlfriend.  She was somebody I was kind of seeing, but it was still something that had potential  and she wanted to do it.  I'm like, fuck it.  I didn't know where it was going to go, but I couldn't just get somebody over.  I'm like, you know what?  That's too risky because then what if they get attached to her?  They know where she is.  It would have to be two girls and no pros. 
[02:52:00]  Just like, yeah, Long Island white trash, like I said.  That's my type.  Yeah, I love...  Boy, that Casey Anthony girl, that murderer, I love her.  She's great.  Why do you love her?  Because she's my type.  She's back shit crazy and complete white trash.  I love that.  Oh, you don't mean on trial for murder.  Nah, no, but she's crazy.  But he's convinced she's going to get off and then maybe he's got a shot.  And open a nightclub.  He's going to do something like that. 
[02:52:30]  He's going to be a pen pal.  I have extra rooms at the house.  I wouldn't mind her moving in.  I don't have kids.  Who cares?  What's she going to do?  We were talking about this earlier.  He's going to write a letter.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like those guys who get...  Usually it's a guy in prison, right?  And then someone who ends up marrying him.  You're going to do that with her?  Yeah, that's what I'm getting...  I don't think my girlfriend would like that very much.  So, no.  I do have a relationship.  She would understand, though.  If you fuck Casey Anthony once, your chick would understand that you're doing it for the show. 
[02:53:00]  I'm just doing it for the show.  Yeah, and for the press.  That's for the show.  Yeah, something to talk about.  That's for the show stuff.  It doesn't really work.  I didn't want to come.  It was fodder for conversation.  That was a business move.  She was up on murder one.  You just have to for the story.  Yeah.  Believe me, I'm writing off the hotel room.  Right.  It was all business.  Let me further promote, too, because Steven's in promoting a gig.  We worked together.  We did Leary's Comics Come Home, and it was the first time I was ever going to be on stage.  Yeah, yeah.  Ken Neely's deal. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, it was great.  We used to go every year, man.  What a great line.  I'm kind of bummed they stopped filming that thing.  Because I can't get up there every year now.  Did they stop filming it?  Yeah, years ago.  I wonder if the comics put a stop to that.  Huh?  I wonder if the comedian said no.  Maybe the comedian stopped signing off.  I don't know.  Maybe it was just time to move on from that, but that comics come home every year.  It's great.  Steven will be at the Newport Yachting Center.  I'm trying to see what day of the week this is.  It is Thursday, July 21st.  There's plenty of time.  It will obviously sell out.  It's in Middletown, Rhode Island, NewportComedy.com. 
[02:54:00]  And if you want to call and get tickets, 800-745-3000.  But it was like watching you on stage.  I had never seen you live, only on television.  And it was fucking hilarious, man.  Oh, thanks.  It was like 6,000 people there.  And you just murdered.  Yeah, thanks.  It gives you faith in audiences when you see a guy not doing bullshit and not overselling  stuff and doing real jokes and just killing.  And you're like, all right, well.  You had a great set that night, too.  Yeah, they were good.  Excellent.  Thank you.  They were a good crowd, man.  It was a fun night. 
[02:54:30]  No, I don't think anybody ate their balls.  Although you're always kind of rooting for that.  It's like you're always kind of rooting for someone to bomb.  Someone's got to go down, yeah.  Yeah.  The first time I saw you was in the cellar.  Oh, God, right.  Like a year and a half ago, maybe.  Yep.  Excellent.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you, man.  And one of the comedians was really nervous that you were there.  Who?  This guy, Anthony.  Anthony Jeselnik.  He was really nervous.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big fan?  Yeah, he loves Steven.  And he wanted to perform well.  And I don't know how he did, but I heard it wasn't as good as he had hoped. 
[02:55:00]  Ooh.  Which I'm really hoping that's true, if anybody knows Anthony.  I got a question for Steven.  Did you ever feel the pressure of changing your delivery?  Because you're so unique and kind of monotone.  Did you ever feel like, I need to get more energetic?  Obviously, it works.  I'm not questioning that at all.  But you're so unique.  Did you feel like, oh, boy, maybe I should change this up?  Maybe earlier in the career or something?  No.  It was later on.  There's not a lot of guys like you at all.  Did you mean later on or in the beginning?  Probably.  No, no.  You know what you're doing, obviously. 
[02:55:30]  I'm talking in the beginning.  No.  Because you hit that stage and extremely unique compared to everybody else.  There was no â€“ how you are thinking about it, I didn't think about it.  Right.  All I did was try to write jokes that I thought was funny.  But that's a lot of confidence.  The rest â€“ no, it was innocence.  It was like â€“  Oh, you didn't know.  It was like how I was saying it.  It didn't even enter my mind.  I was just trying to write things that made me a little laugh at this.  How â€“ it wasn't until a year later in the Boston Phoenix, someone wrote an article 
[02:56:00]  about me, and it said, I don't know, I'm on a tone, I'm on a deadpan, and I was like,  I'm deadpan.  Is that good?  Yeah.  Maybe I guess â€“ I guess I am on a tone.  I guess â€“ I never even thought about it my entire life.  Sure.  So I didn't break it down like you are.  It was like just the jokes.  The whole rest of it was like it just was happening.  But watching from the outside, you hit â€“ everyone's like, what?  What?  Wow.  Not even the delivery stuff, but just the jokes themselves are very unique.  The whole act is unique. 
[02:56:30]  And it seems like when you say â€“ when you tell a joke, you kind of look at it like,  why the fuck didn't I think of that?  Like that's â€“ it's pretty much an observation of everyday life, but you do twist it around.  It's a very unique talent, and were you doing that like at eight years old, just kind of  screwing around?  No, I didn't write jokes until that time.  No, not writing â€“ I couldn't write it.  I couldn't write it at all.  I remember liking words.  It's like I remember saying the word premises over and over for no reason when I was like 
[02:57:00]  14.  Until it doesn't sound like it anymore?  And I remember being in junior high, sitting with some guys saying, imagine a flock of  false teeth.  Like, you know, I mean, that's not an actual joke, but it was just like the layering concepts.  And it sounds like it feels good coming â€“ a flock of false teeth.  It's almost something that could get you slapped in the face, and yet it's totally  clean.  There's something pleasing about saying that. 
[02:57:30]  It's pleasing to the palate to say a flock of false teeth.  But it is a lot of stuff where you're like, wow, god damn, that's brilliant that it's right  in front of your face, but you don't.  Those are the best jokes.  They're not â€“ most of them aren't like that, but the best ones are the ones that when  you think of it, and then it's like, wow, this has been sitting there.  Yeah, I've seen it.  I've seen this.  A little bit of sand has been over it.  Yeah.  Blew it away a little bit.  It's like, you know what you think?  Yes.  Those are like obvious, but no one did it yet.  Do you know, as we're talking â€“ 
[02:58:00]  You stubbed your toe on it.  You stubbed it.  Exactly.  Yeah, you're walking through the sand.  Another luck thing you did.  Look at that joke.  That is a perfect joke.  I wasn't on this page right now.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I truly don't believe that, by the way.  No, no, it's funny, man.  I think you're brilliant, and you deserve everything you've got, but this luck thing  is kind of funny today.  I will never again literally hear the phrase, like, that's a small world, without in my head  tagging it with, but I wouldn't want to paint it.  It's like, what a â€“ that was made to be a setup. 
[02:58:30]  It's a small world.  That's a semicolon.  That's a world.  And he fucking picked it up, and you're right.  That's exactly it.  It's like, and there it is.  Gem.  You know, it's jokes.  It's funny goddamn jokes, which makes the act, man.  Who did you like coming up?  When you were young, who did you kind of look at?  Well, I watched Johnny all the time.  I loved Robert Klein.  Yeah.  Love him.  Love him.  You ever see Robert Klein at Yale? 
[02:59:00]  We were talking about the Mummer's Day parade, and he's wearing that awful sweater.  You probably had seen this, one of his specials from Yale.  He's one of the greatest.  Him and David Brenner and Pryor and Bill Cosby and Carlin.  My main guys were Carlin and Woody Allen.  There was a radio show in Boston.  Every Sunday night, they played two comedy albums.  The guy would play one cut from one, one to the other, back and forth, so he played both albums.  Oh, wow.  And I stumbled on this around the same age I was starting to watch Johnny, like 15. 
[02:59:30]  Stumbled, had a radio in bed with me, and every Sunday I tuned in, and I heard both albums,  laying there in the dark, listening like, and I was like, I think I was studying it without knowing.  I always just loved it so much, and I thought, oh, I like what that guy's doing.  Oh, that's interesting.  And Woody Allen did a double stand-up album before he made movies.  It was called The Stand-Up Years, a double album, and I heard that, and I was like, that's amazing.  The writing of the jokes, the way he wrote stuff. 
[03:00:00]  So him and Carlin were my main guys.  Oh, wow.  I think Woody might be, because Pryor and Carlin were social geniuses, and Woody might be the best pure joke writer ever.  I agree.  It was from 62, 63, and it's whatever, 64 maybe, and it has none of that stuff has been,  and that was in the era of Take My Wife, Please, and fucking Woody comes out with this brilliant,  it's still funny, I still listen to it, I'm like, awed by how great he was at writing jokes. 
[03:00:30]  I just saw his new movie, excuse me, the other night, it was unbelievable.  I heard it's really good.  Midnight, fantastic.  Midnight in Paris, right?  Yeah.  I've seen the movies over the years, and I think, oh, that's good, that's pretty good, that's good,  and I was blown away by this one.  Wow.  I might go see it again, I very rarely go see the movie twice while it's in the theater,  maybe three times in the last 15 years.  He still writes on a typewriter.  He does?  He's a weird guy, yeah, he uses a typewriter to write, he does not use a computer. 
[03:01:00]  That's probably what makes him comfortable, you know?  He likes that feeling, probably like, ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.  That's good, I acted on a typewriter.  What did you find, or what attracted you to Carson?  Like, what did you like about Johnny and that show?  He was, I don't know, he was likable, and he was like, to do that new material every night,  that new five minutes, there was, I can't really, I loved him, I don't even know what  it was like.  I know what you mean, I don't know what.  I watched him all the time, too. 
[03:01:30]  I watched him all the time growing up.  And there was just something so likable about the guy, and just funny, goofies, like the  Mighty Carson art players, and when he'd do those bits, and his monologue, like, he  wasn't afraid to acknowledge that a joke bombed, and it made it even funnier.  That was the thing, the joke either worked, or he made it funny because it didn't work,  so it always worked.  No one else was really goofing on the fact that their jokes didn't work back then, either.  And he knew how to handle, he knew how to laugh, and they said he never tried to be 
[03:02:00]  the star.  He was the funniest guy in the room, but he just lobbed them up, and then stepped back  and let you.  He never competed with his guests to be funnier or smarter than they were.  And how many times did you do The Tonight Show?  About 12.  About 12 times?  Wow.  And he was just like what you said.  I mean, he wanted you to get the laughs.  He wanted you, you know, he just set it up.  Like, he was so smooth, too.  He could talk to anybody.  Yeah.  A scientist, a five-year-old kid. 
[03:02:30]  Yep.  An actor.  Yeah.  It was always smooth.  It was never an awkward conversation.  And you never noticed, like, I never, like, the set-ups, you never wondered, how does  he know he went scuba diving?  Who the fuck told him?  You never realized.  Yeah, he never thought of that.  It never occurred to me.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone told me.  And it was just, it was flawless.  I remember when I was a kid, I didn't understand the reference, but it's one of my, I remember  this, and I laughed because something about I knew was funny, and I still don't even get  it. 
[03:03:00]  I really don't.  But he was talking about someone, someone, it's like doing the polka with Phyllis Shaffley,  and I didn't know who the fuck Phyllis, I still don't know, but she's, but I know she's  awful, and doing the polka with her would stink.  It was something he wouldn't have been fond of.  She was some arch-conservative, I think.  Phyllis what?  Phyllis Shaffley.  But I just remember knowing, and I think it got a zero, the joke.  She does look horrible.  I remember when he would do, he would say for certain amounts of money, like if someone  got a million dollars for doing something, he would say, for that amount of money, I would 
[03:03:30]  wrestle someone naked in Macy's window.  That was his term for a big money thing that he would do.  I guess she was a political conservative activist, so yeah, dancing the polka with her probably  wouldn't be that fun.  I don't remember what it was.  I just remember the polka with Phyllis Shaffley, and I just thought, what a funny thing to say.  Did you ever pick up, I guess I picked up some of those Carson discs when they were selling 
[03:04:00]  them on television, and some of those moments are just timeless, man.  And you see these just huge stars.  Bob Hope comes out, and Sinatra's there with Dean Martin, and they're goofing on, what's  his name?  Oh, God, I can't remember that guy's name.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a little comic with the glasses.  Not Rickles.  No, the guy with the, he made the battle.  Yeah, George Goble.  George Goble.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  And they're flicking ashes in his drink.  Like that whole thing.  That was a time gone by. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, amazing.  They're smoking and drinking.  Like, can you imagine a guest coming out of the talk show with a real drink and a cigarette?  Just wouldn't, you wouldn't see that anymore, but it was just so accepted.  They give you a belt before the Tonight Show if you want one, though.  They have one, though.  They bring around booze.  Yeah, you loosen up a little bit.  If anybody wants it, yeah.  To calm the nerves a bit.  Yeah, I guess so.  I'm surprised nobody's ever gone out really loaded.  I mean, like, back in those days they did, but I'm surprised now nobody does.  Oh, yeah.  There's a clip of Ed McMahon just hammered off his ass one night, and Johnny acknowledges it, and 
[03:05:00]  he's slurring and just a wreck.  But it was hysterically funny.  And that would be, he would have been fired now.  Now it's just like, wow, you're drunk on the job.  You gotta go.  Then it was just like, hmm.  No one can't.  He just looked over and went, really, Ed?  You just knew.  Like, oh, fuck.  Here it goes.  One of the famous Johnny moments is the Ed Ames clip, and everybody's seen it.  It's one of the most famous moments in TV where the, if anyone didn't see it, he played 
[03:05:30]  Tonto in The Lone Ranger, and he was showing Johnny how to throw a tomahawk.  At a silhouette.  At a silhouette against a wall.  And accidentally, the tomahawk point goes right into the cock.  Yeah.  And the great thing is when you watch the explosion of laughter, Ed Ames goes to walk  and remove it, and Johnny just puts his hand out and just stops him.  Yeah, yeah.  And he knew.  He knew.  You cannot fuck with this laugh.  Just let it go.  And during that whole time, it's laughing, too.  Johnny's mind is rolling, because he comes out with a joke right after the crowd starts 
[03:06:00]  settling down a little bit.  He goes, I didn't even know you were Jewish.  Yeah, yeah.  That was it.  That was the joke.  Fuck.  Damn.  Yeah.  It just nailed him with that.  1963.  Yeah, yeah.  To fire that out on television.  Brilliant, man.  To see the instincts of a guy.  Oh, yeah, Sam has got it up right now.  It is weird where we go on this show.  Yeah, you know, right?  The overhanded.  I wish I didn't blow it.  The trick is to keep your arm extended, and that way you break the microphone.  You know, you keep your arm extended and put only one revolution. 
[03:06:30]  Once around.  Once around on the way.  But that's indefinite.  They're playing Indian.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  Yeah.  No, no.  Don't tell you.  That's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  No, no.  Don't tell you.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Nope, nope.  Don't tell you.  That's brilliant, man. 
[03:07:00]  Johnny's sharpening a tomahawk, he's holding it.  It's still in the crotch.  I didn't even know you were doing it.  Bigger laugh, then a bigger laugh.  What timing.  This is growing. 
[03:07:30]  When you watch him reaching for the...  You can see the eye settling in the room.  Yeah, settle the room down a little bit and then nail him between the eyes.  Do you know how easily he could have blown that moment?  Yeah.  By tripping on it or saying it too soon.  Welcome to Frontier Bridge.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, exactly.  Like a wave.  Fucking...  Yeah, he wants to see the Stanley Cup.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this was great, man.  I had a lot of fun.  You'd love to come back.  Unbelievable.  I want you to sign a photo of you and I together. 
[03:08:00]  Of course you do.  So why don't we do this?  Stephen Wright promoting Newport Yachting Center, July 21st, 730 show.  NewportComedy.com.

[03:09:30]  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Show.  Steven Wright was great.  Man, was he great.  You just, you really don't know what you're going to get with someone like Steven Wright.  Or maybe just with Steven Wright.  Because I was saying, with other comics, they talk about their life.  You kind of know what they're all about.  I have no idea what Steven Wright was about.  From his act, he just, you know, he does his jokes, but he never talks about his life. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  I didn't know what Steven Wright would do.  I knew he was from Boston.  That was about it.  Mm-hmm.  And then he starts talking, and you realize, you know, he's funny and cool.  He really enjoyed his time, too.  Yeah, he didn't want to leave.  That was very cool.  That was really.  I would like to come back sometime.  Yeah.  Duh.  Yeah, of course.  I hope he does impression drink.  Linger longer.  Hey, Duke Nukem or the Steven Singer?  What do I have to give away before we get the fuck out of here for the weekend? 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Duke Nukem Forever for Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.  3.  We got one more copy, Travis?  One copy of the new Duke Nukem Forever video game for Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.  The first Duke Nukem game in 15 years.  It's already in stores, right?  Rated M for Mature.  Or must be at least 18 years or older and a listener or subscriber.  Not open to residents of Alaska, Hawaii, or you dirty Canadians.  It's much too cold to play video games in Alaska. 
[03:11:00]  You must hunt.  Right.  And ice fish.  So we'll give that away to a random caller right now.  Right now.  Is anything really random?  Do you really want to start the Bobo stand-up thing right now?  I know.  I'm looking just going like, tick-tock, get me the fuck out of here.  Is there any better feeling after a guest is good?  Like that great post-guest feeling when you had fun?  So why blow it?  Let's get out of here.  We've done enough radio this week.  I think we have. 
[03:11:30]  I think you forget it's Friday.  I think we have.  I fucking was here till 11 yesterday.  I got to go sign some papers.  I have a base of operations here in Manhattan now.  A Manhattan base of operations.  Damn.  The compound is spreading out.  It's the compound west, I like to call it.  Damn.  Compound west.  I am a dual domicile person.  I have a Manhattan apartment.  You should have bought because I know you're- 
[03:12:00]  Oh, how about you shell it out?  No, I'm not sure.  You know what it is?  I'm not sure if I like it or not.  So I'm going to see.  I'm going to feel it out.  And then I may purchase something here in New York.  I did.  I bought a six-bedroom.  You didn't ship.  You didn't ship.  Yes, I did.  You didn't.  It's in the Time Warner Brothers place.  Time Warner Brothers place.  Six bedrooms on the top of the floor.  On the top of the floor.  Of course.  Right up on the top down at 79th floor.  The penthouse?  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah?  Or is it the one that's over the penthouse, which is even better?  That's it, yeah.  It's a better one.  Chip, there isn't one over the penthouse.  Yes, there is.  No, see?  I caught you.  No, you didn't.  It's the penthouse.  Even higher?  What is the elevator button for it if the penthouse is the highest?  Yeah.  Just, yeah.  Yeah.  It's got a penthouse on it, but with a plus sign.  And how much was it?  $37 million. 
[03:13:00]  Where are you that got that kind of money?  I just was investing.  Investing?  Yeah.  In what?  Coke's going into bottles soon.  Oh, it's still canned.  I fucked it up.  Yeah, Coke's going into cans soon.  Chip's dumb.  He wouldn't know.  Why would Chip know?  He's an idiot.  Boy, I am pretty glad we didn't get in on that Pandora.  IPO.  Where is it down to?  It's down like $13 and change.  The IPO is a $20.  This is a Citadel nightmare.  Another Citadel nightmare for people.  For the people that jumped on Pandora. 
[03:13:30]  Some guy, one of these analysts came out and gave it a $5 and some odd cents target price.  And it just took a shit after that.  Yeah.  These analysts ought to keep their fucking mouth shut.  It's like, I don't own the stock.  I don't have a position in that stock.  But let me tell you something.  I don't believe it's valued at any more than $6 a share.  It's like, yeah, I got a fucking position in it, dumb fuck.  How about you shut up?  You cock, you stock blocker.  That's what he is.  A stock blocker. 
[03:14:00]  Hashtag that.  He's helping his friends out, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, his friends know that he's about to share.  Yeah, no shit.  They short it.  And then he says something.  Listen, we're going to get the fuck out of here.  Yes.  Before, though.  Believe me, I was just stalling.  Take away a little more time, Ope.  No, I got it right here.  That's all I was doing.  These guys have been working really hard behind the scenes on a new concept.  Yeah.  I don't even want to call it a bit.  No.  A new concept called Bobo Cop.  We got to debut Bobo Cop before we get the fuck out of here. 
[03:14:30]  I can't even go to the weekend without hearing this.  And listen for not only the voices of the Opie and Anthony show, but A-list celebrity.  There's an A-list celebrity in this?  I would consider him close to A-list, yeah.  A legitimate celebrity is in this, not Opie and Anthony show.  I want to know.  No, no.  Let me see if I can guess.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Let's try to guess.  I don't like Sam trying to save Bobo's comedy for the shit show.  I'm not trying to save him.  Oh, I know.  He is, too.  No.  No, don't play his comedy. 
[03:15:00]  To truly make it the shit show.  We'll do it Monday, but it might take a while.  It's a recap, motherfucker.  Oh, look at Sam.  Sam's blinking really heavily now thinking, I got nothing now for the show.  When do I ever have anything?  That's true.  Bobo.  Yeah, I'm here.  You've been on hold three hours.  Congratulations.  Yeah, I know what it is.  All right.  Hold on.  Three hours he's up to.  No joke.  Three hours and two minutes.  Wow.  That's not a record, though.  Gary Coleman has that record. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, poor little fella.  He's dead.  Here's Bobo Cop.  What we have here is the best of both worlds.  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer.  Onboard memory and 30 years of human experience and interaction.  Bobo Cop, what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law, and to jerk off in a toilet,  part man, part robot, complete imbecile. 
[03:16:00]  Alive or dead?  Dead or alive, you're...  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid.  Eat a bowl of d***.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area. 
[03:16:30]  Can I get it?  Please respond.  We have a 63 in progress.  All right.  Let's go, Mr. Maloon again.  Bobo Cop.  Who is he?  What is he?  I suck.  The dumbest, most annoying person on the planet is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  Bobo Cop.  Bobo Cop.  Any special message for the kids at home?  Believe me, you're right.  You gotta wear a condom when you go to sleep,  because you don't want to jizz in your pants when you...  Bobo Cop?  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, stay out of trouble. 
[03:17:00]  Bobo Cop.  I like it.  Yeah, right on, man.  Goddamn, Bobo's just screwing his shit up.  Right on.  Catch me every time.  What am I supposed to say?  And was that iced tea I heard?  That it was.  Damn.  It was the iced tea.  All gangsta and shit in there.  What did he say?  Something about...  Call him a, you know, metallic...  Mon boy.  Mon boy or something. 
[03:17:30]  I thought I was the A-list celebrity.  Ah, you were.  I heard you in there, too.  I didn't hear Mr. Maloonigan being brought up.  He did.  Oh, yes, he was.  Oh, he did.  Okay.  It was in there.  I must have been laughing at the previous part.  He's the canine unit.  Oh, the canine unit.  Mr. Maloonigan.  What a terrible name for a dog.  It's the worst name for a dog.  Mr. Maloonigan.  What an ass.  Bobo, could you hold on for a little longer?  Yeah.  Sam's going to talk to you during the shit show, I think. 
[03:18:00]  All right.  How long have you been on hold?  I lost track of how long they've been on hold.  Bobo, are you on your cell phone?  Where are you?  On your cell phone?  No, I'm on the home phone.  Oh.  Where?  Outside?  No, at home.  What are you in here?  A generator?  What's going on in the background?  I know you're at home.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus.  What are you next to, a machine that makes dumb statements?  Are you?  No, you might be hearing the fan in the background. 
[03:18:30]  Oh.  That's great.  I wish it was a fucking helicopter and you were standing there with Vic Morrow.  Bobo Morrow.  Yeah.  Bobo Morrow.  I wish Vic Morrow was holding you in his arms and your little Vietnamese hairdo would be  lopped off.  Let's just put Bobo in everything.  Bobo Morrow.  We should.  Bobo Morrow.  Oh, she's wearing a little purplish light number today.  Got her hair in that dumb bun, though.  I don't like that at all.  I like when she puts it in a ponytail and it's down. 
[03:19:00]  She looks elfish and pixie-like.  Yes.  Her ears are fucked up.  Yeah, they are.  Yeah, she looks like a little wood elf.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a wood elf.  Yeah.  Elf and magic.  You got your wood boy phone and your nutty boy phone.  No.  She is a little wood elf.  Look at her.  Just trollalying through the forest, dumping her daughter somewhere.  Exactly.  Behind a tree.  Oh, she's so guilty.  But, you know what? 
[03:19:30]  I think she'll get off the hook here.  Yeah.  Look at her.  She's going to start laughing.  She makes these eyes at the lawyer.  I don't know.  I'm captivated by it.  All right.  I'm ready to say...  Have a good weekend?  Start this weekend.  Yeah, that's what I'm ready to do.  You guys do it in five minutes.  Bobo, hold on.  I'm out of here.  We're giving you five minutes.  Oh, how kind of you.  Oh.  Oh, yes. 
[03:20:00]  Is Bobo still on hold?  Enjoy your weekends.  Yeah, Bobo's on hold for you.  And I hear Ronnie wants to talk to him, too.  So make sure he stays on hold.  Oh, yeah.  Who comes on your show?  Yeah, Ronnie wants to talk to him.  Lots of people.  I know.  I've heard Opa on it.  I've been on briefly.  You, Anthony, Roland, Troy.  Star Stunt of E-Rock, The Morning Mashup, DJ Who Kid, Loverboy.  I called in to complain the other day.  Yeah.  From the road.  I had a complaint.  They were talking about, you know, the Gene Simmons thing.  They weren't.  We talking about it. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  We were talking about the Gene Simmons thing.  And then Sam goes, oh, there was this whole situation with Jill Nicolini.  And, you know, let's play that bit.  Because while the show was on.  Where Gene Simmons was trying to, like, pick up on Jill.  And Anthony got mad and stuff.  So it's like, okay, that sounds interesting.  So they start playing the bit.  But they played it from the beginning when Gene walks in for the interview.  And it was 20 minutes of fucking Gene plugging his shit, talking about his garbage and his fucking concert that they're doing by Mount Rushmore. 
[03:21:00]  And never getting to the part about the controversy.  Was I being nice to him?  Oh, you were being disgusting.  That was not with the banana.  That was with the banana.  We offered him a banana.  That was embarrassing.  I'll leave you with this.  I know you're onto that.  But this is breaking.  Just got a Google alert.  Yeah.  The wiener shot that pushed Pelosi over the edge.  Whoa, no way.  We're the reason. 
[03:21:30]  Was it?  Yes, we're the reason.  All right.  That was the moment she said he had to go.  It says, it appears that the moment that convinced her, the New York Democrat, how to step down was when an X-rated picture of his nether regions was leaked to the radio DJs of the Opie and Anthony show and spread across the Internet.  Hey.  That was the moment Pelosi said, enough already.  I always feel good when I get to take a dem down.  Oh, my God. 
[03:22:00]  Do you understand?  Now this show has.  The speaker of the house.  Well, former.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  Good enough, though.  She was, though.  Basically.  That skeleton.  What's next?  Tip O'Neill.  Exactly.  Who are you going to talk to next?  Tip O'Neill.  We have officially done it all.  We are affecting government.  We officially have done it all.  That's great. 
[03:22:30]  The Wiener shot that pushed Pelosi over the edge.  That's the headline.  Yeah.  It's the Atlantic wire, but.  That's okay.  When people in government, when Nancy Pelosi and Anthony Wiener and Newt Gingrich.  Newt.  Newt Gingrich.  And, of course, I'm sure the former speaker of the house saw it.  Who?  Tip O'Neill.  Tip O'Neill.  I don't feel good about myself right now. 
[03:23:00]  No, I don't either, man.  Fuck him.  He was a good politician, man.  The more I saw Wiener, even though he's a flaming liberal, I still kind of like him because he's not from money.  He's from middle class people.  He's a fucking, he wasn't some scumbag lawyer.  There, there's a lot to like about him.  I would love to know what these other congressmen are up to that are doing stuff way worse than Wiener.  They just haven't got caught.  Yeah, well, you know, politicians tapping their feet underneath fucking bathroom stalls looking for blowjobs. 
[03:23:30]  Yep.  There's a bunch of dirty birdies out there.  What, what, we made it to ten.  We weren't supposed to make it to ten today.  Ah, shit.  What's wrong with us?  We instinctively do our duty.  Oh, we are really good.  We're duty doers.  We're guilt ridden.  Yes, we are.  We can't even fucking leave a little early and get our weekend started.  We care.  We're duty doers.  We do care.  I don't know why.  We fulfill our duties.  Still 59 after the hour.  We're beaten.  We're just beaten down and feel that we have to.  Sam, it's 59-45. 
[03:24:00]  We fulfill our duties.  Sam, you're going.  Can you say Tip O'Neill one more time before we start our weekend?  It literally has to just come out because.  Four.  I don't like Nancy Pelosi, but I did like Tip O'Neill.  No, you blew it.  What happened?  We're in overtime.  I fucking hate you.  Tip O'Neill.  Why Tip O'Neill?  I like Tip O'Neill.  You can either do Tip O'Neill properly, or you can do the Bill Tetley song. 
[03:24:30]  It's your choice.  Bill Tetley.  B, please.  You fucked up his rhythm, Sam.  B, I, L, L, L, T, E, T, L, E, T, L, E, Y, Bill Tetley.  What?  See, sometimes you leave a long pause there.  Yeah.  Sometimes you just go, B, I, L, L, T, E, T, L, E, Y, Bill Tetley.  But then there's other times where you throw a few snaps in the middle because it's nobody's 
[03:25:00]  fucking business.  I hate Bill Tetley.  You can go as long as you want.  B, I, L, L, T.  Y, E, T, L, E, Y, Bill Tetley.  Boom.  Pick your neck up whenever you want.  That's the beauty of that song.  It's always going.  Of course.  It's continuous.  Like the universe expansion.  Chop, chop.  The virus.  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[03:25:30]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, sir.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Opie and Anthony just took off.  I mean, to say it was a Friday exit would be an understatement.  They were out of here.  I can't believe that we even kept them in the studio until 10 o'clock for all of you  out there.  But for your sake and for mine, I mean, I enjoyed it, too. 
[03:26:00]  I'm glad that they stayed as long as they did.  It was also very funny.  Based on the first break of today's show, by the way, if you didn't hear the first break  of today's show, I'd recommend listening at, is that Garrett walking up the hall?  Tell him to come in.  I would recommend listening to the first break of today's show at 3 p.m. on the replay,  Eastern Time, because they went into this whole thing about management.  I'll get into that in a second.  Garrett just walked in from, well, of course, as Bobo would tell you. 
[03:26:30]  And Bobo, stay on hold, because we are going to get to you.  As Bobo would tell you, from the IDW days.  Dinks.  But more currently, from both the Jay Thomas show and the special delivery show.  He's actually, I don't know if you guys know this or not, but, oh, by the way, the thing  that Ant was talking about, the show on the air today, about how guests come in and they  pull the mic down and the mic falls out and we, as a show, look like assholes.  Yeah.  Garrett just did that.  So we look like assholes.  Didn't Mars say it was going to be fixed, no problem? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, well, it was a problem, because it wasn't fixed.  Because he went home at 9?  Wow.  Eric, venomous.  And we will, by the way, there was some fallout of the Eric push-up contest situation.  I'll talk about that in a little bit, too.  But, yeah, you started producing for special delivery for no apparent reason, correct?  I did, yes.  What compelled you?  I mean, I guess people would ask me the same question, but what would compel people like  us to give up our Saturday nights for no particular reason? 
[03:27:30]  Well, this place kind of robs me of fun.  Yeah.  Because they're constantly making me do stuff that I don't want to do.  Sure.  So I figured, there's one show I kind of like listening to, I might as well help them out.  Yeah.  So then if they tell me I have to do something, I'd be like, oh, well, I'm already helping  out this show.  Special delivery.  Yeah.  It's like actual fun radio.  Right.  And it's kind of weird, you know, in this place.  And it's not like Dave and me are going to come in on a Saturday night and be like,  Derek, where were you on that?  Where were you?  We need you. 
[03:28:00]  We're counting on you.  I make mistakes every show.  And what do I care?  Whatever.  What do we care?  Look, they're not going to pay host.  One of the hosts.  Yeah.  You know, you think there's going to be a lot of like, oh, Garrett messed up a call.  But Garrett, more importantly than all that is the Ira situation.  Really?  Ira is a guy who used to come on this show almost every week under your watch.  Actually, you'd come in, you'd be Ira's.  I called you Ira's personal producer.  You would come in with Ira, make sure everything was okay. 
[03:28:30]  And while, yes, the Opie and Anthony show does rightfully so have a reputation for abusing  people, I'll say, in general.  For instance, Bobo.  We were always very nice to Ira.  Actually brought him in and would tell him how much more we liked him than Bobo while Bobo  was standing right there.  Ironically enough, Bobo was actually on hold listening to this.  So, but that's what we would do.  And then all of a sudden, one day, your boss, Jay Thomas, and I don't want to make you say 
[03:29:00]  anything derogatory about your boss.  That's not why we're here.  Okay.  But your boss, Jay Thomas, said he doesn't want Ira on the Opie and Anthony show anymore.  Yes.  Why was that?  He's very protective of Ira.  Why?  What's he doing with Ira?  Ira's...  What's he really doing with Ira?  Ira's brother is like the second in command at like Goldman Sachs or one of these huge  company type of things.  So he's very powerful and keeps a watch on Ira and doesn't want anything. 
[03:29:30]  So Jay is worried that if Ira comes up here and gets abused on our show, then his Bilderberg  brother will come down.  Troy, you know what I'm talking about.  We'll come down and just rain, rain hell on him.  Yes.  And now one show, someone called up and they were like, yeah, there's a video on YouTube  of Ira watching two girls, one cup.  Well, what's wrong with that?  He's an adult. 
[03:30:00]  I mean, you're telling me Ira can't watch two girls, one cup.  I see.  Troy, you've seen two girls.  You know, Eric, have you seen it?  Of course.  So, I mean, what's the problem with Ira being included in the fun kids?  I don't see a problem, but Jay got a little...  So that was what...  Yes.  We've had major comedians and celebrities in here that have watched two girls, one cup.  Yes, but they're not a mentally challenged 70-year-old man.  Oh, you're telling me that Chris Rock has his wits about him more than Ira does?  I think so.  Oh, okay.  That's the difference. 
[03:30:30]  That's funny.  So that's his whole thing.  He's so afraid of Ira being made fun of or taken advantage of.  And he saw...  That was what the tipping point was.  He saw the...  Or he heard about the reaction, Ira's reaction to two girls, one cup.  Yeah, that was one of the things, yeah.  Was there anything else?  I don't think there was actually a thing.  It was just...  It was like, I'm afraid of this happening, and this video that I'm hearing about is...  Yes.  ...is fueling that belief.  And the reputation that Opie and Anthony have to him, even though it's probably totally incorrect, 
[03:31:00]  he, you know, is scared of that.  He thinks that they're all going to make him pull his pants down, which they kind of did once.  I don't know what you're talking about.  He compared ball sizes to Ari with Joe Rogan.  I don't remember that at all.  Don't call that.  Don't remember that one.  Sorry, Garrett.  Garrett, I think you're incorrect.  Give it to my show, yeah.  That sounds more like a J. Thomas bit to me, to tell you the truth.  Well, because Ira also has come to me as a businessman and has said that he would like 
[03:31:30]  the blowjob queen, who was on our show once, rebooked on Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Now, would J. Thomas have a problem with that?  No.  Do you really think we're going to take blowjob lady in here without Ira?  No.  Right.  Would you?  So, I mean.  I was hoping, like, J's in town.  He was in town this week and next week.  Mm-hmm.  They got to have some sort of crossover where they talk in the hall or something.  Well, Troy, you've tried that before, right? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, I tried to hook that up.  I mean, it just, it didn't happen.  I think they said on the air today that something may have happened today.  I mean, I don't know this.  No, that wasn't about J. Thomas.  Oh, okay, okay, because that's what I thought it was, because I saw J. Thomas walking around.  I was like, oh, boy.  That was about another show that broadcasts out of this building that there's a problem with.  I love it.  I love all the problems.  I think that might have been related to the Paris Hilton incident and a certain show, you  know, taking shots at us.  Yeah. 
[03:32:30]  I think we all know what I'm talking about here without saying it, don't we?  Yeah.  But it would be interesting to see, I'd love to see J. just stop down.  I don't know if he would ever do that, but.  I don't even know if the guys would want him in, but I mean, or would Jay be worried  that we'd abuse him and make him take his balls out and take advantage of him?  Well, Jay, you know.  Listen, Murphy Brown.  We work on the big channel here.  What's that?  Howard 101.  Oh, is that the big channel?  Yes.  Okay.  Jay's kind of a free.  Now, that's the channel that has a show about fast food, right? 
[03:33:00]  I don't know.  Okay.  Eric, you're the guy.  You're the expert.  I believe so.  Okay.  Really?  I don't even know that.  So, he just, he might be afraid to come on here to sever ties with the cash cow, you  know, that is Howard.  Well, you know, Shuley came on, what show is it?  Wasn't he on one of the worst of shows with doing a fake voice?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, he came on doing a fake voice.  Shuley did.  And he thought that, like, he could get away with that. 
[03:33:30]  So, he came on and did a fake voice.  And I said, Shalom, Biatch.  And he left the studio.  And I guess this is the first time we've publicly said that.  People might be able to pick up on that.  Yeah, that was Shuley.  And Shuley even told me that somebody emailed him saying that, one of the ONA guys is stealing  your Shalom, Biatch.  I said, no, I'm not stealing it.  I was trying to ironically state that that was Shuley doing a fake voice from Howard  100 News on the virus.  You know what's funny about all those guys is, I'm friends with a lot of guys on the 
[03:34:00]  tapes team and whatnot.  What's the tapes team?  They go through, they archive all of Howard's stuff.  So, he's got a team that does, like, I call it, like, a sex bagel team.  Right.  Like, a whole team that just does E-Rock's job.  Well, they have to go through all the old, you know, K-Rock stuff.  E-Rock, that's not out of line.  That's what you do, isn't it?  Yeah, but nowhere to the level that they take it to.  Oh, so they're, like, a lot more skilled than you?  No, they're just, they have a lot more hands-on to get all of that done, and they do it in  more detail than we can do it. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Look, Eric, there's no can or can't, there's a won't, and that's what I hear coming out  of that.  No, there's no fucking won't.  Pay me more and I'll do more.  Pay you more.  How could they possibly pay you more?  The company would go bankrupt.  We're all starving over here, and you're living high off the hog.  Exactly.  Anyway, as you were saying, this guy, more money.  As you were saying, I'm sorry, Troy.  Sam's not starving.  He had a nice lunch yesterday.  Well, we'll get into that.  I cost the old Nagel family some cash yesterday.  I probably didn't even feel the dent.  He didn't feel it. 
[03:35:00]  No, no, no.  But Howard's Tapes team guys and Howard TV guys, they're all fans of O&A.  Are they?  Yeah, and they come up to me all the time, like, oh, I heard you on the air, or this  was funny when this happened, and stuff like that.  So they have different departments over there, because you said tapes and the TV crew.  What about the actual people who work on the show?  Are they fans of the show?  Uh, I mean, you know, Shulie.  Shulie, yeah.  I mean, you know.  That's the news department.  How many departments does that guy have?  That's a lot.  That's a good point.  Does he need that many departments?  He has this floor and some of the 19th floor. 
[03:35:30]  Eric, you're in bed with the enemy.  Uh, this is, I say the enemy.  Trey just said that they're fans of the show.  Are there people on that side of the building?  There are, yes.  And not, I'm not, no, we've mentioned the tapes team, the news team, and the TV team.  What about the show team?  There's people over there who have talked to us, yes.  Oh.  They love the show.  I mean, they listen.  We all get along.  They listen really closely, too.  They do?  Yeah.  You know, like, they've come up to you and say, this is an instance that I enjoyed. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, they were like, oh, I heard you on earlier in the week, blah, blah, blah, and all the  safe stuff that were said.  Do they ever talk about after Opie and Anthony live?  No.  No.  They haven't mentioned it.  You either.  How about you with the, Shuley?  Is he?  No, never.  No, never.  Hasn't brought that up.  10 o'clock is usually cigarette break time.  Cigarette break.  That should be the name of this show.  Go on your cigarette break.  Well, uh, Gary, you know, uh, Troy.  I do know Troy. 
[03:36:30]  You didn't let me finish my sentence, Garrett.  Listen, you can get away with this kind of nonsense on special delivery, but this is  a real deal show.  Tomorrow night, yes.  8 p.m.  8 p.m.  Eastern.  I almost said 9 p.m.  Eastern.  Now it's 8 p.m.  Eastern.  Uh, for two big, big time hours.  Nice.  Three was just far too many.  It's just an overkill.  Three hours a week.  Come on.  Get out of here.  Leave them wanting more.  Oh, yeah.  A lot more.  Um, Troy, you're trying to, uh, further yourself completely outside of this place. 
[03:37:00]  What do you, what do you, yeah, he almost said it.  Oh, yeah.  You see, people let their guard down in here, Garrett.  They forget that, like, we're still on a giant channel with people listening.  Anyway, um, Troy, and since I've built a reputation of just being obnoxious, nobody knows whether  to take what I'm taking seriously or not.  Yeah.  So I just get away with murder, and other guys like Troy are just left under the bus somewhere.  They think I'm just being goofy Sam again.  But dealing with you, you have to know that, so.  Yeah.  Uh, so we were talking about your, uh, trying to further yourself way outside of this place. 
[03:37:30]  What do you got going on this weekend?  Because Garrett and me are doing stuff for this company.  What do you got going on this weekend?  I'm DJing tonight in Redding, Pennsylvania, at Club Reverb with Q-Ball from the Bloodhound  Gang, so.  Wow.  Eric, are you jealous?  You're a big Bloodhound Gang guy.  I, I know Q-Ball.  Oh, excuse me, Nagel.  Whoa.  Sorry.  Same tax bracket.  Yeah.  Well, same tax bracket when, uh, Bloodhound Gang was doing stuff on MTV. 
[03:38:00]  I mean, I don't know, now Nagel's a little itch over.  Yeah.  No way, guys.  I'm not that rich.  No, they're not that rich.  No, they're a good one.  They do.  I mean, they, they're huge in Europe.  For some reason, you know, they play festival.  They headline festivals in Europe.  Really?  Still?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Yeah, they go over there every summer and just clean up.  So, Q-Ball and Troy Kwan are going to be where in Redding, Pennsylvania?  Club Reverb in, uh, Redding, Pennsylvania.  Tonight?  Yep.  Tonight.  Uh, it starts at, uh, 9 o'clock, 9 p.m.  So, we're going all night long, right?  Yeah, we're going until, you know, 2 o'clock is when the bars close out there. 
[03:38:30]  So, we're going to be partying.  But shit, that don't mean the party's over.  That's right.  You know what I'm saying?  Troy Kwan on Facebook and Twitter.  Well, it's good that you got stuff going on outside of this place.  I mean.  You got to do something, right?  You got to make money somehow.  Yeah, I got to get that paper.  Listen, uh, we were talking, by the way, when Opie and Anthony were leaving here today,  it was very, that's the morning mashup.  Opie specifically told me.  I've heard.  You told me, and I brought Nicole on Twitter.  Good advice.  Less is more with them?  Yes.  You think so, too?  Okay, good.  I'm glad. 
[03:39:00]  I love getting feedback in and trying to incorporate that into this show.  So, um, Opie and Anthony went on the air this morning.  And, I mean, I can't, this is them.  I'm reiterating what they said.  They actually went on the air and said that, uh, they talked about their all-boss, Eric  Logan, and said that the management here, none of them hold a candle to him.  Like, and they went, like, they were very literal about it.  I think they said nobody could walk in his shadow.  Yeah.  I think that was their example.  Walk in his shadow.  Like, not even, like, in his shoes, in his shadow, which is just, I would be insulted. 
[03:39:30]  I don't know.  I don't know if anybody was, but I would be.  Um, but the thing about Eric Logan is that it wasn't, like they said, too, on the show,  it wasn't always easy times with Elo.  Um, he definitely did, uh, have a back and forth with the show that you don't see too often  in management.  Uh, he was on the air a lot.  Even though he was in D.C., he would call in.  And at one point, he actually had one of these, uh, replay machines, the sound effect  machines, the 360s.  He had us, the staff, uh, get a new 360, completely, uh, mimic the buttons on, on Opie and Anthony's. 
[03:40:00]  I think he did Anthony's.  But do a complete replica.  Clone it completely.  Send it to him in his office.  He had it connected to his phone in his office so he could call the show and car crash and  do all Opie and Anthony's sound effects.  He also had it hooked up to a sound system in his office so while he was having meetings  and somebody would say something, he would hit, like, boring and the car crash.  So, I mean, he was, he got the show and everything. 
[03:40:30]  Also a lunatic, obviously.  He was a crazy person.  But, uh, it wasn't always easy times with Eric Logan.  And, uh, there were lots of times when Opie and Anthony wanted to get stuff done and they  would have threats.  Is that right, Eric?  Am I going in the right direction?  Uh, you're heading in the right direction.  I would, like, a little assistance from you because last time I set up a bit that I trusted  you to cut up, you didn't have anything in the setup.  Like, I, I, you know, I set it up and the things that I set up, you had actually cut 
[03:41:00]  out of the bit instead of left in.  Yeah, that, that was opposite day.  Yeah, I had no idea we were theming.  So, what happened here?  We were, uh, we, we decided to, uh, we came up with this bit.  I, I don't know who initially on the show, but as a show, we developed, uh, cocks in  a box.  Right.  That was when we actually took a cardboard box.  Uh, awesome, Garrett.  Was this before the song?  I didn't even know the song.  It was a song.  Timberlake, Dick in a Box.  Oh, yeah.  It was way before the song.  Yeah, it was way before the song.  What we did was we found a cardboard box in the studio. 
[03:41:30]  It had a flap on the top.  So, we, we opened it so, like, you could open it like a flap, like Eric said, and we  filled the entire interior as well as the top and the bottom of the box with gay pornography  pictures because we had some gay porn mags in the office.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Okay, yeah.  It's 57th Street.  It was a wild time.  So, we filled the inside with gay porn and then we took a dildo, which we also had in the  office.  Oh, yeah.  And we, uh, we stuck it.  We mounted it to the bottom of the box.  So, when you opened the box, you were just inundated with gay pornography and gay sex 
[03:42:00]  items.  We closed the box and none of this was on the outside.  It was just a cardboard box and wrote on the outside of the box, free puppies.  But that would trick people.  Right.  And then what we did, and then what we did is we put the box on the sidewalk on 57th  Street and then I went way across the street and hid with a video camera and I think,  Eric, were you or Danny?  It was Danny on the street.  Danny was on the phone, uh, calling into the studio and we were observing as people 
[03:42:30]  opened the box, checking for free puppies, finding lots of hard phalluses, like dicks.  Was it mostly women?  No, it was anybody.  Women and men.  Where we were, there was a lot of businessmen walking back and forth at that time.  Yeah.  But so, Eric, so we, so we did the bit once.  We did it, uh, yeah.  Believe it or not, without approval.  Really?  We just did it.  Huh.  Um, that was one of the benefits of being isolated on an island on 57th Street. 
[03:43:00]  Um, and we found out from management that was not to be done again.  Yeah.  We had to take it off the street and Opie and Anthony had a big problem with that.  Yes.  And so explain, so, so we got our boss, our big boss, Eric Logan on the phone, right,  Eric?  Uh, no, not, not yet because we tried getting in touch with Logan, but he was in a meeting  or something or avoiding us.  We couldn't get him on the phone.  Um, so Opie and Anthony decided that we're going to have to take matters into our own hands  and have the PES email cock photos to Eric Logan's corporate email. 
[03:43:30]  Now, does this bit include a conversation with Eric Logan or just about?  What this bit is, it's like one or two calls, it starts off with one or two callers talking  about how they're sending the photos to, to Elo.  Uh-huh.  And then finally, Elo has to call in to address all of this.  And then he starts reading through his email and describing what he's getting.  So, Garrett, uh, if you were to go on the Jay Thomas show and, who's your boss?  Uh, Craig Schwab.  Okay, if you guys said, I don't even, Craig Schwab, if you guys said, send Craig Schwab  pictures of erections, would you guys, would Craig Schwab call in and be like, hey guys, 
[03:44:00]  what are you doing?  Honestly, I think he, because he's from the NAW days too, actually.  Does he go on the air?  No.  Well.  But I don't think he would mind that, you know.  If you gave out his email address on the air.  Yeah, oh, okay.  And then listeners sent him.  I think you kind of forgot about that part.  I said his name.  There you go.  We'll never figure it out.  We say lots of names here, Eric Nagel.  If they can figure it out, Eric Nagel.  We say names all the time. 
[03:44:30]  So, this is what, oh, hotline, hotline, hotline.  Uh, hello.  You thought I was on the party.  Get out of here, Roland.  So, we, uh, I gotta start memorizing phone numbers.  We did this.  Uh, we had the listeners send him cockpicks.  This is the aftermath, and the setup, really, of, uh, cockpicks to Elo, the new, uh, who's  currently the president of Harpo, on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, I love it. 
[03:45:00]  A cockalypse now.  Oh, my cockalypse now.  It's kind of hard to say.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now is flying over.  Hey, Joe from El Paso.  Joe.  Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Uh, yeah.  This gives a whole new meaning for you got mail as an M-A-L-E.  Oh, M-A-L-E, you've got mail.  Very good.  It's, uh, Chris in Mississippi.  Chris. 
[03:45:30]  Hey, it's Chris.  Hi, guys.  Love the show.  I think we need to change Elo's name to Swallow.  What?  Do we?  A swallow.  Are you sure?  Yeah, let's go to Kirby from Wack Bag.  Kirby, what's up?  I asked an El Paso.  A cock picture.  It's like, it's an extreme close-up.  The head of the cock is pointing right at the camera.  There's a tarantula on the cock, and the tiniest little drip of semen is coming out  of the head.  It's either the very beginning or the very end of an orgasm.  What a great photo.  Launch your cocks. 
[03:46:00]  They're launching from all over the place.  Next wave.  Next wave.  Let's go to Joe.  Launch your cocks.  Joe, what's up?  Joe.  This is Joe from New Jersey.  Hey.  First time caller, one time listener.  Bye.  Dude, this is the fucking gayest show ever.  I know, and we're proud of it.  We've got to launch cocks.  You ever see a cock come apart like that, man?  Holy shit.  Let's send the bitch cock pictures.  Let's send cock pictures to the whole village.  Do it for Manny and Sal's cocks. 
[03:46:30]  Let's say hi to Pat in Boston.  Pat, what's up?  Eero gets the cocks.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Oh, very nice.  Wow.  Baghdad Bob is calling.  Baghdad.  This is Baghdad Bob.  There are no cocks invading the XM compound.  Well, apparently, not one picture has made it through.  Did he go, Frunkus?  Yeah.  Frunkus.  Let's get a bill in Jersey.  Bill.  Oh, we will stay the course, gentlemen. 
[03:47:00]  We will stay the course.  You sinked your cock, Elias.  Wow.  The phones are just lit.  Hotline is ringing.  It's Elo.  It's how the cock laughs.  Let's see how Operation Cock is going.  Let's talk to the enemy.  Elo.  Are you guys having fun yet?  Hi, Eric.  Elo.  Hi.  How are things?  Couldn't be better.  I bet.  What's wrong, Elo?  Nothing's wrong.  Have you checked your mail? 
[03:47:30]  All 242 of them, yeah.  That's just the first wave, my friend.  Right.  By the way, the other thing that I think that, you know, good God.  Who the hell?  What was that one?  That is, that one, this one is directly from Come Cock UK.  This is Ivan.  Look at that.  The British are always willing to help us out.  That had to be a real pioneer of that shit. 
[03:48:00]  Who ever got Come Cock dot UK was really ahead of the game.  Come Cock.  He really knew that this internet was going to take off.  Yes.  Elo, could you just read off maybe some of the subject lines that are coming in?  Resume.  Resume.  You're costing me cash, Cock.  Not more Cock.  FBA Cock.  More Cock.  Let me scroll down here.  Free Puppies.  No, what that one was.  There you go.  Then we're getting creative because they know that, oh, if you put Cock in it, he won't 
[03:48:30]  answer it.  So now I've got 2007 Budget.  Good.  Good.  Because the message board has been chatting with each other trying to get a battle plan  together.  So they probably said, make the subject line something business oriented.  Eric, what's in the budget one?  What's in the budget one?  Fuck.  Hold on.  Shit.  Hold on a second here.  Oh, great.  This is a guy who actually does take a picture of his cock from his cell phone.  He wasn't home, but he had to participate. 
[03:49:00]  He's in line at Starbucks.  It's like an insurgent.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That was an RPG or whatever it was called.  Yeah, an RPG.  Hey, Anthony.  Improvised, i.e., whatever.  Yes, Elo?  Anthony, is your email up right now?  Uh-oh.  Are you forwarding them to me?  No, I'm just going to show you.  I'll forward you the budget cock.  All right.  Let me pull up mine.  The other thing, too.  Now, Opie, you, I think, and Anthony both, you've talked to my assistant here at the office, 
[03:49:30]  right?  Yes.  So I had to bring her into my office.  And I said, now, listen, we're going to have to have a delicate conversation.  And she thought she was getting fired.  Uh-oh.  And I said, you're going to see a lot of cocks today.  You're going to see a lot of cocks today.  I need you not to sue me.  I need you to understand that I'm not sending you the cock.  But there will be a lot of cock.  I am not kidding you.  I'm having a hard time logging on to my email.  Everything's running really slow.  I think there's too much cock.  Yeah, because the entire email server at XM is going to break down here. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, here's a sample.  This is great.  This is almost like we're doing a damage assessment before the next strike.  You know how you have to look at, see if the buildings have been damaged enough.  Yes, that is a fine hit.  That's a smart cock.  That's a smart cock.  All right, Anthony, I just sent you the one.  This is a more cock one coming your way.  More cock?  Yeah.  And there's some very interesting ones.  Actually very creative.  All right. 
[03:50:30]  No, Alex hasn't come through yet.  Come through yet.  Your cock hasn't come through yet.  Ah, more black cock.  Here we go.  Oh, God.  This guy's bent over.  He's shoved all of his hardware back between his legs.  So it's just his balls are resting on his asshole.  Oh, is that wonderful.  Here's one.  Urgent.  Urgent.  Urgent.  What is it? 
[03:51:00]  Oh, I'm sure he's sending it over.  I'll tell you what urgent.  Here, urgent.  Hold on.  Let me open it up again.  I think my computer's going to crash.  The other thing great about this is, oh, nice.  It's a guy with a giant rod that's not nice.  You won't like it, Jimmy.  It's not groomed.  And he's squirting some sort of KY juice on this thing.  Okay.  Urgent.  Fine.  Well, now we...  That goes to Anthony Cumia.  Okay.  Forward. 
[03:51:30]  We have to...  Now we have to do a little diplomacy here.  This is what Nixon did to get the Vietnamese to the table.  Bomb the shit out of Cambodia with cocks.  That's right.  And then Vietnam came to the...  Can I just take a phone call real fast, though, before you go with a plan?  Is this oral cock now?  Greg in Oregon.  Greg, you're on with Elo.  Hey, Elo.  I was wondering if you were enjoying the Battle of the Bulge.  Battle of the Bulge.  Boring. 
[03:52:00]  Punching out, boys.  Elo, boring.  We have a very diverse audience, so they're getting pictures from certain websites.  There's a gentleman who looks like me.  He might perhaps be into TikTok music when he's not looping up.  Okay.  Now they're getting good.  Yeah.  Why?  I need a door to a caddy.  That was my old email to you.  I love how Elo's got his own sound effects for his own phone call. 
[03:52:30]  Okay.  Now this one, by the way, I'm going to give...  Oh, I think it just screws up and up here.  Son of a bitch.  It just screwed...  Hold on.  You better not have sent that off.  He hit forward, and it went to the boss.  Yeah.  Hugh.  Oops.  This one is...  This one is...  Ah, good.  From tfrolix at anyop.com.  Of course, that email box has probably sent one email.  And it was, to me, subject line, Bob Edwards contract dispute. 
[03:53:00]  That's pretty good.  Wow.  That's clever.  Yeah.  That's the best one.  This one just in, Ethel Listening.  Oh, this is a nice one.  Letter from Mom.  A new one just in, Reference Inquiry, and Urgent Attention Required.  Any emails from Oprah yet?  No, but I'm sure they'll be coming shortly.  Oh, yeah.  How many are there in total so far? 
[03:53:30]  I've got a...  Let's see.  It's hard.  I've got to get...  I've got, like, since I've been on the phone, I've gotten 90 new emails.  So that's probably not counting when I was...  What was great is I was actually in a very senior-level meeting because I got to get ready  for this call here in a few minutes, and I'm, like, looking at my BlackBerry.  And, by the way, I know I've got to get out of this meeting to call you guys.  And I looked down, and I had, like, two unopened messages, and it went to 112, and it  was, like, cock, cock, cock.  And I'm, like...  You know, it's...  Right.  You missed your deadline.  I had Carlisi calling me, like, a madman, like, leaving me a message. 
[03:54:00]  Please forward every picture to me.  Every picture forward to me.  Yes, I'll name the people who there are pictures of.  I recognize them.  I'll help you out.  You better call.  I mean, I didn't know any good way to stand up at this meeting and go, listen, I've got  to go.  I've got to take a call about cock, so I couldn't...  Oh, anyway.  Well, did you do any discussion...  Have any discussions about our Box O'Cocks contest?  I did have a lot of discussion.  I talked with legal counsel, two different legal attorneys here, and got all the answers, 
[03:54:30]  of which none of them are going to like.  Well, all we want to know, is there any way we are going to be able to do this Box O'Cocks,  maybe with a different theme somehow?  What did the lawyers tell you?  Keep sending cocks.  That's right.  We aren't ready for the bargaining table yet.  After ONA Live.  And I don't know if you could hang up on your boss nowadays, either. 
[03:55:00]  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, and I'm Sam Roberts.  Garrett's still hanging out.  E-Rock's still here.  Everybody's around, except, of course, for the talent.  Although, I did see Jim walking around.  Of course, Louis C.K. was in studio that day.  We were talking to Eric Logan.  And kind of trying to put forth that as much as he's put up on a pedestal now, in hindsight,  there were some days where Opie and Anthony didn't necessarily agree with everything he had to say.  E-Rock, do you think we should go to this call that's been on hold for a long time? 
[03:55:30]  Just a quick check-in.  Fine.  Okay.  Bobo!  Yeah, that's right.  I'm here.  Okay, man.  Tell me this, Bobo.  When did you call the show?  I don't even remember when I stayed, what time I did.  I lost track at a time.  Was it towards the end of the show or the beginning?  Maybe somewhere in the second hour.  No.  It was somewhere in the 7 o'clock hour. 
[03:56:00]  Early in the 7 o'clock or late?  Somewhere early in the 7 o'clock hour.  That's what I thought.  What time did you...  Well, you call...  And the guys didn't even talk about this on the air.  I don't know if they knew, but I will tell the audience.  You called our office phone at quarter to six this morning.  Yeah.  What time did you wake up?  Oh, I woke up at like 50.  Well, then how did you call at quarter to six?  Did you hear?  Because it's not like I just made it up. 
[03:56:30]  I said, you called at quarter to six.  And he said, yes, that's right.  And I said, what time did you wake up?  5.15.  How did you do that, Bobo?  I don't know.  Maybe I got up a little bit earlier than that.  Why did you get up so early?  No, I don't know.  Because I wanted to make sure that the video was sent.  Well, you guys might not know this.  You probably should because we talked about it on the show.  But Bobo did stand-up comedy last night.  That's right, Gary.  He did stand-up comedy. 
[03:57:00]  Heather Height, who's one of our...  I mean, she's one of our listeners, but she's also somebody who's helped out the show many  a time.  She's been in here a bunch of times.  If you're a hardcore, you'll definitely know who she is.  And if you're not, now you know who she is.  So either way, it doesn't matter.  She was doing...  She's a stand-up, and she was doing a show last night.  She got Bobo on the bill.  Now, was he intro-ing like he did Voss?  No!  He got to do a set.  Bobo, how long did you do?  How many minutes?  It was seven minutes. 
[03:57:30]  Okay, seven minutes, and that was squeezed into a three-minute YouTube video how?  I don't know how.  Are you sure that that was a full seven minutes, Bobo?  I don't know if it was a full seven minutes or not, but...  Eric, you're better at math than me.  Can seven minutes be squeezed into a three-minute video?  I don't think so.  No.  Okay, so we're probably...  We went three minutes.  We're probably looking more like two and a half minutes, because we also had the intro  and the outro on there.  How was it?  Yeah.  The video.  Oh, the video? 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  I laughed.  Okay.  All right.  Bobo, how did the show go?  I think it went great.  I got laughed.  You did.  But did you...  Was there...  How many people were in the audience?  Maybe about 30.  Wow.  And I guess...  I remember you saying it was a door deal.  So what kind of percentage were you getting of the door?  I wasn't getting paid for this one.  No, no, no.  That's not what you told us.  You told us you were getting... 
[03:58:30]  I didn't want to make you guys feel so bad.  Why would we feel bad?  No, I didn't want to make you guys feel so bad.  That's all.  Well, go ahead, Eric.  I was just curious.  Did Bobo bring his own headshots like he did the other time?  Did you bring headshots to sign?  No, I didn't bring this one.  You didn't even set up a merch table to get some cash?  No, I didn't because I don't have merch.  Why don't you have merch?  You had a headshot.  Travis is walking down the hallway.  You should have shirts and headshots, Bobo.  Something to add to this...  Well, it'll be a thing that if they get a little bit worse, 
[03:59:00]  that would say they bid it.  Well, first, before you get merch, you should also get paid to do this.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But I'm sorry to see...  Travis is coming in here.  Did you hear what just happened?  Yes.  That Bobo said that he didn't get paid,  and the reason that he didn't tell us that  was because he didn't want us to feel bad.  That he told...  Bobo, are you sure...  I'm sparing our feelings.  Yeah, are you sure that it wasn't just a deal where  they said, yeah, we'll give you a percentage,  and then they were just like, 
[03:59:30]  look, there's 30 people,  and Bobo, let's be honest,  you didn't draw any of them.  I'm very sure.  I didn't want to make you guys feel bad.  Bobo, you told me that you were getting  an unprecedented 50% door deal.  They just said...  That would have been...  Bobo, that would have been $150.  I don't want to make you guys feel so bad, all right?  Why would I feel bad for you?  Yeah, why would we feel bad?  If anything, I would feel bad for Heather Height,  who, to give up 50% of her door,  then you've got to pay the club and the other comics. 
[04:00:00]  Wait, I said that so you guys didn't feel so bad, all right?  Why would we feel bad?  I don't know.  Travis, you saw a full video,  and you even pulled the audio  that Opie and Anthony are going to play on Monday.  Seven minutes?  Is that how long?  Bobo said he did seven minutes.  Well, that was how much time I had.  Travis, you pulled the audio.  I sure did.  What are we looking at?  About three minutes?  About three minutes.  Okay, so I estimated correctly.  All right, Bobo said that's how long it went, all right? 
[04:00:30]  Bobo decided he only needed to do  about 40% of the time that he was given.  Well, I'm glad they didn't pay you.  How many jokes would you say are no three minutes?  How many jokes?  Or attempted.  Oh, uh...  Four.  Oh, wait, hang on.  It was about two.  Yeah, two.  About two.  I'm sorry.  It was about two.  And one of them we made up and gave to him.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Which he proceeded to butcher.  Bobo, you did the Minnie Mouse joke? 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  Great.  Great.  I thought that was strong when we thought of it.  So you took...  They offered you seven minutes of stage time.  Yeah.  And as an aspiring stand-up comedian,  you thought you would go ahead  and only use three of the seven minutes  and in that full three minutes only tell two jokes.  Well, I wanted to make sure I got everything in  so when I was planning on what I was performing that day...  Yeah.  I wanted to make sure it fit the seven minutes  that it didn't go over. 
[04:01:30]  Okay, well, did you go ahead and do the material on your own?  Maybe even in front of a mirror  and then look at a watch and say seven minutes hasn't passed  or is that sort of falling into the  math is not your strong suit category?  No, it wasn't it.  I just wanted to make sure it didn't go over.  I think he's saving it for the special.  That makes sense, too.  You don't want to blow it all in one shot,  especially knowing this is going to be broadcast.  But you feel good about your material. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  You feel good about what you did.  Yeah.  You think this is the start of the next phase  in Bobo?  Yes, exactly.  Travis, what were your thoughts afterwards?  I thought he killed.  Okay.  Like you, I laugh.  Okay, good.  Is Troy leaving?  I was going to tell Troy what Bobo just told us,  but he's walking back.  I guess he had to record The Boneyard with Norton.  Well, Bobo, I'm glad...  In even bigger news,  your epic production piece, Bobo Cop, 
[04:02:30]  finally debuted today.  How did you feel about it?  You were waiting on hold while it was played.  As you were for most of Opie and Anthony  and after Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, I did hear it,  and I enjoyed it.  I thought it turned out great.  All right, well, I'm going to go ahead  and put you on hold.  Is that cool?  We're going to get right back to you?  All right.  Okay, put you on hold.  Sam, remember the story  when I told you about people telling us  that Bobo, like at FH Riley's,  would go around and talk to people saying,  I'm the famous Bobo?  Yes.  Do you think he's going to do that now 
[04:03:00]  with Bobo Cop?  He does that anyway.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll never forget  the time that he came to us  and said,  you know, I'm really starting  to become famous from the show.  The other day,  I got recognized by my neighbors.  He's waiting on hold right now.  He doesn't understand.  He doesn't see what we're laughing at here.  He says, no, you don't understand.  It's not a joke.  My neighbors really did recognize me. 
[04:03:30]  So take that for what it's worth.  Does he ever tell you guys  the fantasies he has of like,  I'm going to go to a Phillies game  and all the Philly fans  are going to know me and hate me  and it's going to be a whole stadium.  Did he tell you that?  Yes.  He has all these fantasies  that are really weird.  Now, would you consider these fantasies  or delusions of grandeur?  I would go with the second one.  Okay.  Garrett, I asked him earlier  about the headshots.  One time he was trying  to do the standup thing.  He got off the stage,  picked up a pile of his own 
[04:04:00]  printed out headshots  and started handing them out  to the audience  while the next comedian  was on stage.  Uh-oh.  Steve Sterniolo  is walking down the hall.  I wonder who's head  he's going to rip off today.  The man beast,  Steve Sterniolo.  Oh, he just pointed in here  and he's going to keep walking.  Maybe he's...  Did you hear him, Travis,  yesterday destroying Iraq?  I was curious.  Maybe he would be able  to get Bobo's stuff on.  He does work for Raw Dog.  We're going to look into that.  But I wanted to give BoboCop  another play.  Yes.  Because, I mean, 
[04:04:30]  Derek and Danny  worked very hard on it.  And, Garrett,  you haven't heard it.  No.  Listen for the celebrity voice.  Was he your teacher?  RoboCop was, yes.  Oh, okay.  In Syracuse.  No.  This, Garrett,  this is the next generation,  sort of a 2011 type of thing.  This is BoboCop.  What we have here  is the best of both worlds.  The fastest reflexes  modern technology has to offer,  onboard memory,  and 30 years of human experience  and interaction. 
[04:05:00]  BoboCop,  what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust,  protect the innocent,  uphold the law,  and to jerk off in a toilet,  all right?  Part man,  part robot,  complete imbecile.  Alive or dead?  Dead or alive,  you're...  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you,  you metallic mongoloid.  Eat a bowl of dick.  Will he be able  to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember? 
[04:05:30]  Bobo,  it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo!  You, you.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  Can I do this?  Please respond.  We have a 16-3 in progress.  All right,  let's go,  Mr. Maloon again.  Bobo Cop,  who is he?  What is he?  I suck.  The dumbest,  most annoying person  on the planet  is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  Bobo Cop,  Bobo Cop, 
[04:06:00]  any special message  for the kids at home?  Believe me,  you're right.  You gotta wear a condom  when you go to sleep  because you don't want  to jizz in your pants  when you're-  Bobo Cop!  Sorry, sorry.  I mean,  I mean,  stay out of trouble.  Bobo Cop.  And,  yes,  Garrett,  I know you were looking at me.  The voice that said,  called him a mongoloid  and told him to eat  a bowl of dicks,  that was indeed  star of law and order 
[04:06:30]  SVU Ice-T.  Yes,  that was Ice-T  who told Bobo Cop  to eat a bowl of dicks.  Bobo!  Oh,  he's still on hold.  He's probably answering.  Yes!  Bobo!  Yeah,  yeah.  Do you hear that again?  Yeah,  I hear it.  How impressed were you  that Ice-T  now knows who you are?  I'm impressed.  Are you surprised,  though?  Not really,  right?  Not surprised.  I'm surprised.  I had a feeling  that was eventually 
[04:07:00]  going to happen.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  wait,  wait,  wait.  What did you say,  Bobo?  I had a feeling  eventually there'd be  an A-lister or two  who would know  who I am.  Why?  Bobo,  why would an A-lister  or two  know who you are?  Well,  things go well,  that's what would happen.  Do you think  they'll know you more  for your comedy career  or your radio career?  I don't know.  I have a feeling  maybe from a comedy.  He's very diverse.  But I have a feeling  there might be people 
[04:07:30]  that would know me  from Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  I'm going to put you  on hold again,  all right?  Bobo.  Wait,  no,  no,  don't stay on hold.  Bobo,  you should follow  Ice-T on Twitter.  No,  I'm still on.  Who are you talking to,  Bobo?  That was my mom.  Okay.  Eric,  tell him what it is  because it's getting  to be too much Bobo.  I can feel it.  I can feel it  when it happens.  Sometimes I let it happen.  Right now,  I'm not going to.  You should follow  Ice-T on Twitter  and ask him  to get you  on an episode  of SVU.  Now that he knows 
[04:08:00]  who you are.  All right,  I'll do that.  This is the famous  comedian Bobo  from Bobo Cop.  All right.  All right,  stay on hold.  Thanks,  buddy.  Bobo's back on hold.  There was also,  Garrett,  I wanted to play this  while we still had him.  Do we have,  yeah,  this is quick.  Yeah.  Have you heard  the Good Boy Phone,  Naughty Boy Phone song  that Jim's been singing?  The Drew Boogie one?  Well,  yeah,  Drew Boogie  turned it into something.  Yes.  We took it to the next level.  Really?  You ever heard  of the band Godsmack? 
[04:08:30]  Yeah,  they sound,  Rinsabel.  Yeah.  You know,  lead singer,  Sully?  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  Good boy phone  and your naughty boy phone  You naughty boy phone  and your good boy phone  You good boy phone  and your naughty boy phone  You naughty boy phone  And your good boy phone  And your good boy phone  Your good boy phone 
[04:09:00]  Is when you're home  With the old crow  And your naughty boy phone  Is when nobody's home  And that little fucking whore  From Canada blows up your phone  It's your good boy phone  And your naughty boy phone  You naughty boy phone  And your good boy phone  You good boy phone  And your naughty boy phone  Naughty boy phone  And your good boy phone 
[04:09:30]  I like the naughty boy phone  It's magic.  Sully from Godsmack, everybody.  Listen, we've got to wrap up.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I'll be on Hits 1 this afternoon until...  That's new.  Yeah, really.  There's airtime.  I'll take it.  From 5 to 9 p.m.  I'll be on Hits 1 today,  so you can listen to your Ron and Fez.  Actually, you'll have to compete a little bit 
[04:10:00]  because the replay of After Opie and Anthony Live  will be on at 7.  I'll be on Hits 1,  so you'll be able to take your choice.  I wish some of the bosses knew who I was.  I'm on every channel.  It's ridiculous at this point.  Eric, it's a crime at this point.  I mean, the people who run this channel know,  but beyond that...  Do you see what happened to Shully?  He used to be you.  He had his own show.  He had all six shows.  I could be on 90 channels.  They'd never know.  He probably just fizzled out.  I was like, fuck you.  Two weeks ago,  I was on three channels at the same time.  Nobody knows who I am. 
[04:10:30]  What difference does it make?  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hopefully, I'll see you later on Hits 1.  If not, see you Monday.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez coming up next.  Fuck you!  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
