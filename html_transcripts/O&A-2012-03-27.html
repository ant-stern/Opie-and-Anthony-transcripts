<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a disgruntled discussion about the Shorty Awards.  Anthony Cumia, Sam Roberts, and Jimmy Norton, all nominated but ultimately losing, lambasted the event's low production value, questionable judging (pointing fingers at Luria D. Ocampo and her allegedly misleading emails), and generally "dorky" atmosphere.  They recounted their negative experiences, highlighting the presence of Tiffany Thiessen and Mayor Michael Bloomberg (a Foursquare "mayor" award winner).  Norton was particularly irked by an email from Ocampo suggesting he’d win, prompting him to record an acceptance video that was never used.  The conversation then veered into a discussion of Laura Korn's sex advice books, followed by a humorous, lengthy segment dissecting Tim Tebow's repetitive use of the word "excited" at a press conference, and concluded with a particularly embarrassing anecdote about Jimmy Norton's nose-picking incident in an elevator – a theme that unexpectedly continued.

Opie then shared his own humiliating elevator nose-picking experience, sparking a listener call-in segment on the surprisingly prevalent practice of cleaning toilet seats with socks, knees, or even bare feet.  Listeners detailed their own unusual bathroom habits, prompting a discussion on varying hygiene standards and Opie's infrequent laundry habits (wearing jeans for multiple days) and his unusual hierarchy of disgust (snot above feces).  The conversation also touched on a listener’s girlfriend's unconventional cleaning method (using her buttocks) and a search for video evidence of comedian Bob Kelly allegedly performing a similar act.  The show also briefly addressed the Trayvon Martin case, expressing skepticism towards Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson's involvement and commenting on media coverage.  This segment concluded with the surprise arrival of Shaquille O'Neal.  Shaq's enormous size became a running gag as he navigated the studio.

Shaquille O'Neal's in-studio appearance dominated a significant portion of the show.  He discussed his successful comedy recordings, emphasizing his authentic style and strategic approach to endorsements (highlighting his Dove Men's Care commercial with his mother).  He shared his outspoken nature and lack of concern for controversy, contrasting this with the image-conscious behavior of others, recounting past incidents like a comedy club incident where a recording of his rap was sold without his knowledge.  Shaq discussed his business acumen and financial strategies, his cautious approach to investing, and his reliance on a “little Jewish guy” financial advisor.  His cautious approach stemmed from witnessing the financial struggles of his stepfather and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He spoke about his retirement from basketball due to declining performance and injury, reflecting on his career, key moments, and players he faced, including his opinions on LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Jeremy Lin.  He also discussed his interest in MMA. The interview included humorous banter with a studio employee and touched upon his law enforcement career, the challenges of fame, and his use of Bible quotes from his mother to combat negative publicity. He shared anecdotes from his past as a breakdancer, overcoming a speech impediment, and his admiration for various comedians, along with his aspirations to be an action star and a funny anecdote about meeting Mike Tyson at the Porn Awards.  He also shared humorous stories about encounters with fans and a Brazilian steakhouse (Fogo de Chão) experience.  Finally, he discussed LeBron James's championship potential, the media's portrayal of athletes, and his own ranking amongst top NBA centers, concluding with a plug for Dove Men's Care.  Following Shaq's interview, a brief interview with Aziz Ansari took place.

Aziz Ansari's interview focused primarily on his self-released comedy special, "Dangerously Delicious," and its direct-to-consumer distribution model, similar to Louis C.K.'s approach. They discussed the advantages of bypassing traditional distributors and reaching a wider audience, particularly internationally, and eliminating network edits and commercials.  Ansari explained his rationale based on significantly higher YouTube views compared to DVD sales. The conversation touched upon the challenges of stand-up comedy, including unpredictable audiences and the pressure to create new material. He shared anecdotes about bombing, comparing a comedian's act to wearing tires, and discussed the role of social media, especially Twitter, in a comedian's career, highlighting the sometimes inaccurate reporting based on social media.  He mentioned his roles in *Parks and Recreation* and early experiences with Manny from the Comedy Cellar.  The interview included a humorous exchange regarding a poorly written one-sheet for his appearance. Ansari concluded by discussing his upcoming tour for "Buried Alive" and the challenges and rewards of creating new material.

The final segment circled back to the balance between promoting one's work and providing entertaining content, with Opie expressing concern about overwhelming listeners with self-promotion. He used a joke ("Two Jews walk into a bar, they bought my special") to illustrate blending promotion with comedy. Aziz Ansari promoted his special, providing website and social media information, and Opie promoted his own upcoming appearances at Caroline's Comedy Club. The show concluded with the hosts wrapping up.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Oops, you almost hit yourself in the chin there.  I pulled my mic right out of my mic holder.  There.  Hey there.  Welcome, welcome, welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Bomboiazi, bomboiazi. Wipe your card off. Wipe your card. 
[00:00:30]  I can't get enough of him.  He rules.  He does. He rules the roost.  Are you smelling like Shaq today? Getting ready for the big Shaq interview?  I did put on a dab of his doteran.  I'm smelling like Shaq today. You smelling like Shaq today, Jimmy?  I have it every day this week.  I'm smelling like him after a game when he used to play.  Like the bottom of his ball bag.  Imagine that's what it actually smells like.  You're going to love my son.  Really?  Just basketball sweat.  Are we Shaq?  It smells like Kobe's ass. 
[00:01:00]  Oh.  Or does it smell like Shaq's ass?  Shaq's sweaty ass.  So you can smell what Kobe smelled?  Yeah.  When Kobe had to taste his ass?  Taste.  Take a taste.  What was the line?  What?  Sam?  Tell me how my ass tastes.  All right.  Right on.  Are you just saying that or are you actually telling the line?  I just wanted you to say that.  Yeah.  Now they're going to isolate it and make you look stupid.  That doesn't make me look stupid.  Yeah, it does.  That's like an insult.  Tell me how my ass tastes.  Insult to injury.  Yeah.  You're bad at it.  It's not me looking stupid. 
[00:01:30]  That's what Shaq said.  Oh, we'll just assume it's a guy that's looking at your ass, though.  You can assume whatever you want.  I don't know what gets you off.  For some reason, that's not good, right?  The show just starts and I got a jacker in the room.  Jacker?  Get the fuck out of here, you friggin' asshole.  You're always sexy when the show starts.  I know.  I don't blame him.  Assholes.  Good morning, everybody.  Wow.  What a night, Opie.  What a night.  Yeah.  A gala event that rivaled the Academy Awards, the Grammys, the Tonys. 
[00:02:00]  Any other awards I'm missing out on?  The Razzies.  The Golden Globes.  What's some of those other awards we got?  What's some of those other awards we got?  Independent Spirit.  Independent Spirit.  B.E.T.  Sores.  So what are you talking about?  Scream Awards.  Of course, Opie, I'm talking about the culmination, the grand finale after all these months of the Shorty Awards 
[00:02:30]  that, of course, you know, a few people in this very room were nominated for.  All right.  You don't have to rub it in.  And I wasn't nominated.  Well, we were big nominees.  Yes.  Big, big stars.  It was a big night.  Who was nominated?  Well, Anthony Cumia.  Sam Roberts.  In the radio category?  Of the shit show, as it is called.  No, it's not.  Oh.  Yeah, no.  It was nominated for radio.  That's right.  For the category of radio. 
[00:03:00]  How are you nominated for radio and we weren't?  He does a lot of shows.  And you guys gave up on the industry?  It's about quantity, not quality of the show, Opie.  That's what Sam's really going for.  Look, it's not very good, but I do a lot of them.  There's so many of them.  Yeah.  Why don't we go for the radio category for Shits and Giggles?  We should have.  We probably would have lost that, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And, of course, our own adorable Jimmy Norton.  Yay! 
[00:03:30]  Oh, wait.  That's me.  I can't cheer as loud as I am.  You can't cheer for yourself.  You ever see when they say, give yourself a hand?  Jimmy Norton, nominated in the category of comedian, which I think is very appropriate.  Man has done comedy for years.  Honed his craft.  21 years.  Almost 22.  Wow.  Damn.  Very funny gentleman, as we have seen.  And, of course, your own Anthony Cumia here, nominated in the category of Best Web Show, 
[00:04:00]  which I do from my own basement with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment.  In a better studio than we're in now.  Yes.  Exactly.  In a better studio than we are in right at this moment.  That's true.  But, when I sat down, I went to the Shorty Awards and sat down.  Cut to the chase here.  I'll give you some of the details.  But, we all, we all lost.  What?  Yes. 
[00:04:30]  That's impossible.  Jimmy Norton lost for comedian.  What?  Against some fucking idiot.  I had no clue who he was.  Well, Jim Norton knew he would lose as a comedian.  Jim Norton called it and refused to go to the Shorty Awards.  Because of that.  They tried to bamboozle you.  Yeah, they did.  Yes.  Because they also bamboozled, they actually did bamboozle the hippo juice people.  Hippo juice people, we know, they're from down in Florida and stuff.  Did they send them a bullshit email?  They did.  They sent them a bullshit email, and they flew up from Florida. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, it's.  For the bullshit.  What's the bullshit email?  The bullshit email, Opie.  It's the bullshit email.  Who did you sit with?  Because no one went with you.  No, I didn't.  No, you remember it was going to be a big table, and it was going to be all of us.  First of all, no tables.  Let me, yeah, I'll get into the.  I thought you got a nice table.  Oh, no.  I'll get into the details of that fucking clusterfuck.  Sam, did you go?  No, I didn't show up for it.  Why didn't you show up?  Why wouldn't you?  Because it was bullshit, because I knew exactly.  I knew they were going to. 
[00:05:30]  The whole thing is bullshit.  I knew it was bullshit when I saw E-Rock there.  Did E-Rock go?  Yes, E-Rock.  Bullshit.  The radio category, because they never sent me an email.  Right.  Hold on.  E-Rock went for what reason?  Just do more brown nosing?  Yeah, to be included.  He's the king of brown nosing, man.  He loves to get in there.  E-Rock was sitting in the back, like one of the fucking people reviewing it, just looking  like, yeah, what the fuck is this more shit?  Why would you go to that thing?  On the off chance that Ant actually won, I was going to record it, but see, he was actually  thinking the show. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, he was doing something for the show.  Oh, that's very nice.  You know what?  He was thinking the show, and how could you fault him on that?  You're a good boy, E-Rock.  I forgot we used to do things for the show.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  But no tables or anything.  This was held-  What do you mean no tables?  This was held in a place that was pretty much a movie theater.  Where was it?  It looked like a movie theater.  The Times Center.  I don't even know that place.  Yeah, on 41st and 8th, around there.  Yeah.  And it was set up like a movie theater, with movie theater chairs, pardon me, excuse me, 
[00:06:30]  excuse me, when you go into Rose, and you sit down and watch it like that.  What award show fucking does it like that?  You get a place with a stage and then a floor at like a banquet hall, tables, and shit  like that, where you're sitting with people and chatting.  Maybe a bar area so you could get a cocktail.  There was a bar area downstairs.  You weren't allowed to bring drinks into the event.  Yeah.  I'm out in front, in the door, by the door, and the guy goes, you can't bring that in. 
[00:07:00]  And now like a piece of shit, which I am, I'm chugging my beer outside the door before  I could go in.  That's too bad.  It stunk.  And the production was that of a high school play.  It's terrible.  Would you have said all this if you won the award?  No, I'd be like, I'm honored for, uh, no, it was, it was just, this whole Shorty Awards  thing looked very suspicious from the get-go.  Very suspicious.  It was wearing a hoodie, Opie.  It was.  Very suspicious.  Oh boy.  Yes.  Can I, uh, you want to know the bullshit email I got? 
[00:07:30]  Yes.  Please, Jimmy.  I'll tell you, uh, I'll even tell you who it's from.  Uh, it's, uh, Luria D. Ocampo.  I guess.  Oh shit, I know her.  She works for them.  No, I do.  Who?  Okay, here's the email I got from-  She's this chick I know.  Hold on.  Does things.  Does things.  What, Sam?  I know her.  No, I'm just script.  Things.  Well, you know, maybe she doesn't want me blurting out.  I'll give her an email.  She sent me a, uh, she sent me this email, sir.  She's the one that sent the email. 
[00:08:00]  I'm trying to find the original one she sent.  Bullshit email.  I just had them in this fucking stupid Gmail.  Oh boy.  Oh boy, not the Gmail.  Harder to find than the G-Spot.  Ha ha ha, yeah!  No, it's not.  I never found that.  Oh.  Speaking of the G-Spot, can I go off-road for a second?  Let her rip.  I was, uh, I was, I was towing around on my bike and know whose fucking, uh, face popped  in my head?  Uh oh, who?  G-Spot.  Think G-Spot.  This is, you know what?  We don't have to play a game today. 
[00:08:30]  Uh, Laura Korn.  Oh God.  And I'm thinking, holy fuck, I bet you.  All the new rules on regular radio just destroyed her dumb sex book career.  Where she'd come on and talk about fucking clits and orgasms.  And the G-Spot and the come hither to find the G-Spot.  You take your two fingers and put it in.  Right.  And then just do it, come hither to, all right, what is she, fucking 90 now?  Well, we haven't heard from her in years, so I think regular radio knocked her out.  Remember the ice cubes in the mouth to make the oral better, and then you, and then you 
[00:09:00]  put some hot tea in your mouth, and then you switch off, and I guess the girls are supposed  to love that.  I hope she didn't have to get a bladder sling for the fucking prolapsed organ things.  What was the other one you talked about the other day?  Which all women's shit falls out of the vagina.  What was the other one?  The netting?  The vagina, yeah, the uterine net.  The uterine net.  The uterine net.  Oh my God.  Where it holds your fucking uterus in.  Oh, good God.  She had so many children, her uterus fell out.  That one killed me the first time I heard it.  It's hilarious.  Killed me. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Here's my email.  Yes.  Yeah.  From Lori Up.  Congratulations on being a finalist for the fourth annual Shorty Awards.  We would love to have you at the ceremony on Monday, 326 at the Time Center in New York  City.  I wanted to let you know that tickets are now available at shorty4eventbrite.com at an early  burnt discount until Friday, the 2nd of March.  This is a couple months ago.  Warmly, Luria.  Warmly.  So I wrote back, are you implying I would be paying for a ticket to attend the Shorty Awards? 
[00:10:00]  She writes back, hi Jim, yes, we would love to be able to comp all finalists, but since  we're a small team with a limited budget, we rely on ticket revenue to produce the show.  We'd love for you to attend so you could accept your award in person if you win, but if you  can't attend for whatever reason, would you be interested in making a short, few seconds  video in which you could have ready to play at the show?  Let me know what you think.  Thanks, Luria.  And I wrote back, fuck you, Luria. 
[00:10:30]  No, I just wrote, no, thank you.  Give it to one of the other guys.  Oh, man.  That was my email with her.  So she writes back.  Don't worry, we did.  That's what she should have wrote if she was honest.  Yeah, yeah.  Luria.  Luria.  Oh, wait.  Oh, where is it?  Oh, Jimmy.  I can't do this!  Oh, it's okay.  Don't panic now.  You're okay.  Here we go.  Yeah, hi Jim.  Yes, you are. 
[00:11:00]  And I said, no thank you.  Give it to another guy.  Because this fucking Gmail copies and saves everything.  Hold on.  Some people like that feature.  I don't know why.  It annoys me because now I'm opening three of these.  Ooh.  Jimmy's fingers are working magic on the screen, though.  He's letting his fingers do the walking through his iPhone.  Sorry, guys.  Okay, here it is.  God damn it.  I love this.  Here it is.  Oh, here's what she was. 
[00:11:30]  She writes,  Hi, Jim.  We have received strong hints that your account at Jim Norton might be the winner of Comedian.  Please keep the information confidential.  I know you mentioned you would not be able to make it.  Could you please send a video a few seconds accepting your award?  The audience would be thrilled to hear from you.  Thanks.  You liar.  So now you're thinking, holy fuck, I'm going to win this thing.  Well, that sounds like it. 
[00:12:00]  That's I'm going to win this thing.  You won.  I can't say it, but look, you won.  You won, and we don't want you fucking blowing up the awards now.  But she didn't technically lie.  So at least give us a fucking video.  She didn't technically lie because she said we have received strong hints.  That's not all.  She said that.  Yeah, that was just leading you along, obviously.  We know it's misleading, but I know she's not technically lying.  So I sent the video.  I'm like, I'm not going to be a total scumbag.  I'm not going to go.  But I sent a 10-second video.  Right.  Or whatever.  And then she offered to comp me, and I refused. 
[00:12:30]  I just didn't get back to her.  Good man.  Yeah.  So maybe they yanked the award from you.  No.  If that cost you the award, then I didn't deserve it anyway.  Right.  You deserved it.  And then she said, I made a video.  It's short, but I don't know how to get it to you.  And then what was her last one?  Oh, it was something about her offering me the free.  The comp.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't have it here, but she offers me. 
[00:13:00]  She's like, if we could comp you a ticket, if we could get you a ticket, would you be interested  in coming?  And I just knew that there's something so bullshit about it that I didn't go.  But I heard the guy who won is a nice dude.  The guy, Matty.  I've met him before.  Did they get your video idea?  I'm sure they did.  I tried to post it on Facebook, but it wouldn't post my acceptance speech.  Oh, boy.  So who won in the comedy category?  This guy, Matty.  Do you know the guy?  He's a newer comedian, but he Twittered me and said, we've met at the Friars Club, and  he was a nice guy, so I got no issue with him. 
[00:13:30]  Good for him.  My issue is not with the other people.  No, no, no.  It should have went to the guy who had the most votes.  Exactly.  That's literally, Anthony would have gotten it, and somebody else would have gotten it.  Well, then they wouldn't get those other guys buying tickets for the Shorty Awards.  That's what it is.  Yeah, so I really am resentful of that.  That's what annoys me more than anything, is this woman sending me these.  I'll tell you who she is.  Very misleading.  Maybe somebody knows who she is.  Luria, L-A-U-R-E-A-D-E-O-C-A-M-P-O at gmail.com. 
[00:14:00]  Luria DeCampo.  Maybe somebody knows her.  I'm sure she's legit.  It just sounds very misleading.  Yeah, I felt that that was a little bit misleading, that email.  Anyone reading Between the Lines would say, okay, I won, but they can't say I won, but  that's as close as they can come to saying it.  A lot of award shows do just that, and that's why they get the big celebrities to go there.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Because they already know ahead of time they're winning the award. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  They don't do it for the Oscars and the real big ones.  No, they do it for the shitty awards.  The little, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah, Jimmy didn't win.  So you got there, it's a theater, no beer.  It's a theater, but you've got to go downstairs.  He goes for drinks, which is a pain in the ass, and they didn't allow him inside the  venue.  Stupid.  And then it was just a cavalcade of, I mean, of course, it's going to sound like sour grapes  here, but really, it is a social media computer thingy. 
[00:15:00]  Dorks.  They're in their own little world.  Fucking dorks.  Why would you try to get into that world?  I was caught up in the moment.  We don't belong in that world.  I was caught up in the moment of adulation and people, and, you know, oh, yeah.  You were in a room where people were too hip for the room, sir.  Too hip for the room and too dorky.  And too dorky at the same time?  But they thought they were too hip for the room, I bet. 
[00:15:30]  One guy even acknowledged, he goes, oh, well, I guess I'm not the, uh, goes, oh, another  guy wearing a sports jacket and horn-rimmed glasses.  And it was that whole thing going on.  Boo!  The people who run the shorty, I think, are absolute douches.  And why don't you just go with who has the most votes?  That, to me, isn't the fair way to do it.  Then only those people would show up.  They want to get people showing up.  And it's also not fair because someone with a huge fan base could, you know, squeeze out  the award and maybe their stuff isn't up to par with other people. 
[00:16:00]  The seats weren't even full, by the way.  Good.  And the crowd was so lackluster, like they could give a shit about anything that was  going on in there.  And, you know, rightly so.  There really wasn't anything going on in there.  Did you dress for it?  No, no.  I dressed like this.  I just dressed like me.  He dressed.  No, I swear.  But now he's embarrassed.  I swear.  He doesn't want to tell us he was in a $2,000 suit.  Ask Iraq.  I'll fuck it with you.  Iraq, what was he wearing?  $2,000 suit.  Armani.  Armani. 
[00:16:30]  Besides for me, he was probably the second worst dressed person there.  Wow.  This is what, and I knew Iraq would say something like that, but why wouldn't you just say he  was wearing a suit?  Like, why wouldn't you just say he was wearing a tuxedo?  Yes, exactly.  It was a tux.  I was wearing a tux t-shirt.  Hilarious.  Everyone was laughing.  So, was there real celebrities there?  No.  On the stage?  No.  Tiffany Ember Thiessen was the big one.  I'm not saying you're not a real celebrity, but you're right.  No, I wish.  Were there other celebrities there?  I never got on the stage. 
[00:17:00]  No.  Nope.  No.  Who was the biggest celebrity there?  Tiffany Ember Thiessen.  And Mayor Bloomberg.  Why was Bloomberg there?  Well, he...  Well, it is the Shorty Awards.  Coincidentally enough, he won the award for mayor in...  Foursquare.  Foursquare.  Biggest nudge?  What?  You know Foursquare, where you're at a location a lot of times to become mayor?  So, they got the real mayor?  So, he's the mayor.  Of Foursquare?  Foursquare.  And he won.  Oh, that's kind of clever, I think.  And he was there.  What a coincidence. 
[00:17:30]  That's kind of clever.  So, he was there.  He gave a little speech and...  Is she still hot, by the way?  No.  No.  What do you mean, no?  Who, the mayor?  No.  Oh.  You meant her honor.  She's not hot anymore?  Tiffany Ember Thiessen?  Yeah.  Sorry.  No.  Come on.  How old is that picture?  She had a flat, fat ass.  No.  And a wide back.  Look what we're looking at right now.  Yeah.  What year is that?  That girl's long gone?  Gone.  Who is she on?  She was on, like, shows.  Saved by the Bell.  Saved by the Bell.  She was one of the Saved by the Bell bruds. 
[00:18:00]  Kelly Kapowski.  Yeah.  She did some other things, but Saved by the Bell is the biggie.  Yeah.  And she was really sexy, man.  It's over, Johnny.  And she was in all those magazines, men's magazines, and little panty shots and stuff.  Well, you're not going to...  Wow, she doesn't look like that.  No, no.  The hotties of the evening were Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.  Teen USA were a little hotter for you?  Both of them were really hot.  But Teen USA?  No, they were both equally hot.  Equally hot.  Because they were probably three years apart. 
[00:18:30]  Two years apart.  An 18-year-old and a 21-year-old?  Miss USA was probably 21, and Miss Teen USA was probably 19.  Fair enough.  But they come out, and they have their little sashes on, and they're looking all hot and shit.  And then everyone was just bombing up there at the podium.  And the audience, you know, wasn't giving anything anyway.  So it was very quiet.  And during lulls in conversation, I felt bad for Miss USA, because all she was doing was sniffling right into a hot mic during no conversation. 
[00:19:00]  All I was hearing was...  Well, the pollen count is really bad.  It was.  I felt really bad.  The pollen count's really bad right now.  And some of the audience members noticed and started chuckling.  And I was like, why would people laugh at a girl that's got allergic problems or a cold and is sniffling into a microphone?  Or she might be getting the pure stuff.  Well, I don't know.  I think it's just a cold.  I think it might be pollen.  Exactly. 
[00:19:30]  Hot, though, huh?  Yeah, very slender and very energetic out there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A lot of energy.  High energy.  Very skinny.  Did she look like she had slept?  No, no.  She looked like she could have partied all night.  This girl?  Wow.  I don't know.  She looked like she had...  No, I don't think that's her.  That's not her.  Hey, uh...  Why don't you put the year in?  So who won in your category?  Um, well, uh...  Was it Zack?  No.  Good old Zack Ryder?  No, it wasn't Zack.  It wasn't Red Band from Rogan's... 
[00:20:00]  It wasn't Red Band either.  No, no, no.  Was he nominated, too?  What about the Hippo Juice people?  No, no, no.  They were there, but they didn't win.  What about...  Wait, they were there.  They're from Florida.  Yeah, yeah.  They got that letter that you got.  They got the same letter?  And they flew up.  And they went for the bamboozlement.  Did fucking...  Did this woman send out the same fucking letter?  Yes.  Ugh!  If you hadn't bought tickets to the Shorty Awards, they sent you fucking that letter.  You fucking make me sick.  This...  Because she was the event planner, so I guess it was on her to get people there? 
[00:20:30]  Yep.  Of course.  They were fucking repulsive.  They should just get sponsors and fly people in and make sure the people that are up for  the awards don't have to pay for their tickets.  Yeah.  Do it right.  So who won then?  It's the only people that were going.  There's no one else there that isn't nominated.  Was it Awkward Black Girl?  Yes.  Awkward Black Girl.  She does a show.  She won the Best Web Show over Anthony Cumia?  She won Best Web Show.  Wow.  Now...  Why?  Well, you know what?  Can you be honest? 
[00:21:00]  I'll be completely honest.  Does she do a better web show than you?  Well, it's not my cup of tea.  Fair enough.  But from what I saw, it's produced very well.  She does these, I guess, five, six-minute clips.  It's her at work or at home.  And it's in a sitcom style.  Can we play one?  Where she is, I don't know how it translates, but where she does like a narrative.  And then there's a lot of actors, you know, a cast of characters and production value as 
[00:21:30]  far as camera work goes and things like that.  So I don't mind that she won.  It doesn't bother me.  She, you know, obviously they put a lot of work into that.  I just go into my basement and drink and talk about things.  I don't, it's not a much, not as much work goes into it.  You don't feel like you were cheated.  No, I don't care.  I really don't.  Um, yeah, I mean, if anybody deserves it, somebody that actually puts work in their product.  Um, yeah, so I have no problem with that, but yeah, I don't know. 
[00:22:00]  It just seemed like the whole thing was kind of nerdy and goofy and, um, PC.  They had some, of course, Occupy Wall Street won for like best fucking movement or, you  know, activist or things like that.  And then I was like, there's some fucking, some fucking douche chick bitch gets up there  with a sign about the 99%.  And then she just holds it over her head while some little fucking douche bag guy is talking 
[00:22:30]  at the podium and she's thinking she's making a statement and no one cares.  I actually went, oh, all right.  I was embarrassingly, uh, loud yelling it out.  Yeah.  And then when Mayor Bloomberg was up there, this guy, uh, uh, mayor, uh, four square.  Oh, look at this.  The program.  Very nice.  So when the mayor gets up there, this fucking little douche bag that had won for the Occupy  goes like, what leave, leave mayor 1% leave. 
[00:23:00]  And he's the only one saying anything.  It's uncomfortable.  No one's cheering him on.  No one's booing him.  No one's clapping.  It's just quiet and awkward.  What a dick.  He was a dick.  Believe me, I'm no fan of the mayor of her honor, but this guy was such a, just  shut the fuck up.  Trying so hard, wasn't he?  Oh, to make a moment.  Trying so hard to capture a spirit or a moment and flopping.  Stop it. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, that's great.  You're not Brando at the Oscars with the Indian girl giving the fucking speech.  It's great that he tried, though.  That's hilarious.  He wanted a moment.  So badly.  The activism category, I don't know any of these.  Anonymous.  Whatever.  Twit Cause.  Well, anonymous are those computer.  No, I know the anonymous.  Yeah, yeah.  They didn't win.  D-Walk Classic Alexander or something like that.  I wish Anonymous would fucking take down the Shorty Awards.  How nice would that be?  Non-ops.  Occupy Wall Street and someone named C. Shepard. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  I don't know any of these causes.  Oh, Carl Shepard was nominated?  C. Shepard.  Yeah, it's Carl.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's a...  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's just one of those things.  It was so douchey.  You lived on the other side for a night, man.  And then there was hipsters and too cool for the room people.  Hipsters and geeks and nerds.  This one guy gets up and he like...  I don't even know what his category was.  But he comes up with this little tray of plants that he's starting. 
[00:24:30]  You know, you ever see these trays that look like a giant ice cube tray and in each one  is a little soil and a little sprout?  Oh, yeah.  And he's like, he gave the longest speech of anybody in the night.  Your speech is supposed to be 140 characters, you know, sticking with the Twitter thing.  And he gave the longest speech and he was the most boring category.  And he just kept going, wow, what's better, McDonald's or school garden?  What's better, french fries or school garden? 
[00:25:00]  And he shows his plants and everyone's like, shut the fuck up, you nerd!  He was throwing frozen food on the stage.  Yeah, he's trying to, you know, again, make a thing happen and nothing was...  You were hanging out with nerds, man.  Oh, and then the puppet show guys that won.  These two fucking...  What's that about?  They were sitting behind me.  What category?  You rock, you know?  It was another, I think, YouTube channel or something, maybe?  Or YouTube something?  Okay.  Uh, YouTube show? 
[00:25:30]  They were the dorkiest fucking queebs I have ever seen.  And they get on stage and again, they just made everything go too long.  They tried to, it was those chip monkey thing, that puppet up, up, yeah.  No.  It was uncomfortable.  Fafa the Groundhog.  What?  Yeah.  What is that?  I don't know!  It was uncomfortably fucking...  Ugh.  Did Justin Bieber win?  Yes.  As far as YouTube star? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, I think for YouTube star and the Jonas Brothers for band.  But they weren't there.  Oddly enough, not there to accept the awards.  Did they make videos?  Mm, the Jonas Brothers did.  Yeah, Justin Bieber didn't.  Bieber didn't.  I didn't know this happened.  They let Nick Jonas talk because he's the, you know, the one.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's the one that, you know, he's the breakout star of the Jonas Brothers, if you ask me.  He sure is.  Yeah.  It's on the Broadway now, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the program looks nice.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's the money. 
[00:26:30]  That's the money that was, you know, fucking...  You paid for this.  That's the money that was shafted from the fucking people that were told it might win.  I want to see the hippo juice email.  I want to see if it's a form email that I got.  I think it is.  They said they sent a form email out.  Yeah, I think it is.  I'm sure they adjusted a little bit, but I'm sure it is.  We were awkwardly standing out in front of the place in that howling, freezing fuck wind  last night and just commiserating about what horse shit the majority awards are.  It's too bad because it has potential, you know, with the categories and stuff, but they 
[00:27:00]  got to do it better.  And maybe get some more real people in the categories.  Yeah.  The only thing I actually chuckled at was, I guess, the big lifetime achievement, which  is ridiculous because it's, you know...  Four years old.  No.  Yeah.  Was Ricky Gervais, and he had a taped piece that was really funny.  Nice.  Yeah.  He's funny every time.  Yeah, because it was kind of, you know, like, it seemed like The Office.  He was talking about how important the award was. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  But he was doing it like, you know...  He is funny every fucking time.  Yeah, yeah.  He's fucking great.  Sea Shepherd is anti-whaling.  Look up Whale Wars.  Oh, E-Rock.  I meant to ask you...  Yes, sir.  Did your seat have this covering where they put you?  No.  All right.  I started to have a reserved seat.  I actually sat in one of the reserved seats accidentally, and they kicked me out.  You didn't even get a reserved seat?  No!  For being nominated? 
[00:28:00]  Nope.  What a shit award show.  Why wouldn't they have the people that were nominated in reserved seats up front?  Nope.  Nope.  So who got the reserved seats?  I don't know.  Why is my voice getting higher?  Probably the dummies that work for them.  I noticed people that were sitting in these seats with those things over it had their awards  before this thing even started, and then they were collected from them right before  the ceremony, and then went back on stage to receive the award.  Oh, no!  Did they?  Yeah, there was a lady sitting next to me from CNN.  Oh, they probably did a photo shoot with them. 
[00:28:30]  CNN handed her stuff back and then went down to receive her award.  I'll bet you it was a photo shoot or something like that.  People knew that when they won.  There were some people that absolutely knew that they were going to come down and win.  E-Rock, did you enjoy it?  No, it was fucking boring as hell.  Are you sure?  Positive.  Because this seems like it might be something you might get into.  Geeky, nerdy.  It was horrifically boring.  It was very boring.  The production, like I said, was that of a high school play.  And I felt bad for the Daily Show people that were hosting it. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, God.  They were doing a good job, but nobody reacted to anything they were doing.  The guy was very funny.  Who was on the Daily Show?  What the hell was it?  What's her name?  Samantha Bee.  Samantha Bee and her husband.  What's it?  Mr. B.  Jason Jones, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was very funny because he had a who-gives-a-shit attitude.  He was making fun of the dorky-ass people.  He was shitting on Justin Bieber.  Yeah, he was shitting on, like, everybody that was coming up and just being dorky.  That sounds like it would be a tough gig.  Oh.  To host those. 
[00:29:30]  Talk to a bunch of fucking disgruntled web nerds.  Yeah.  Yuck.  And then the last five awards they gave out, no one was there to accept them.  So they just had to go, well, I guess we'll take this with us.  It was all awkward.  No one was-  Good.  Yeah.  Good.  Your award show is not catching steam because of the way you do it.  No.  That's why.  Where was Eastside Dave?  Was he nominated this year?  No, I think Eastside Dave, I think there's a restraining order against him.  He's not allowed to attend after he rushed to the stage when he lost for the weird category  to a llama. 
[00:30:00]  But isn't that what the weird guy should be doing?  Well, yeah.  Is rushing the stage because he didn't win?  So wouldn't the shorties appreciate that?  You would think.  Yeah.  You would think, but nope.  Nope.  What was going to be your acceptance speech?  Well, I was kind of just going to wing it.  Nice.  I planned on, if I had one, getting up there and completely ragging on the previous two  or three people that had gone up because everybody was just horrible and saying awful, nerdy, geeky, 
[00:30:30]  unfunny things.  So, you know, I would have goofed on them.  Opie and Anthony, winging it for the last 17 years.  That's it.  Wing it.  We've been winging it our whole careers.  Cook it.  That's how I roll.  Well, that sounds like an exciting night.  It was so bad.  I mean, and the second it was, I had the opportunity to get up and leave.  Right.  I left and just, and just left the place.  And it was, it wasn't even like, oh, I didn't win.  Let me leave.  Like there was booze there. 
[00:31:00]  There was, you know, and for me, yeah.  And, and I did pay and I paid for like, you know, the, the party room and all that shit.  And I'm just like, get the fuck out of here.  Where's the party room?  I don't know.  It was downstairs in the basement.  You paid for what?  In an after party.  There was like a thing.  You paid for that?  No, I don't know.  I, I just paid for like the premier package.  Oh my God.  Oh no.  Premier package.  Oh, I can't look at him.  Jimmy can't look at me.  You really wanted to win.  No, I, I just wanted. 
[00:31:30]  How much was the premier package?  I don't know.  It was like 110 bucks.  For the premier package.  Yeah.  What do you get with the premier package?  Well, you get.  Certainly not a good seat.  You get.  You don't get your reserve, your seat reserved.  Yeah, exactly.  What do they get?  You have a folding chair in the back?  Yeah, exactly.  If you get the premier packages, you should have a reserved seat.  I should have.  Wow.  But I didn't.  What else you get?  I don't know.  I think it's some kind of like, like the, the open bar thing.  All right.  That's nice.  And, um, access to the, to the big celebrities room downstairs. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And, um, all access pass.  No.  He definitely envisioned walking around the after party with holding his award.  Oh yeah.  Oh, you think that was it?  Of course.  Hob nob and with the rest of the award winners.  Yeah, here I am with my, uh, award.  That's right.  It'd be a goof for you.  Award winner right here.  It was a nerd.  No, it would have been great.  But you also had your award.  Right.  I would have had the award.  And I, I thought it was going to be like, you know, tables and, and, uh, people with  some beverages.  Right.  Oh, they're announcing.  Everybody be quiet.  Yeah, you could socialize a little bit. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Because you kept talking about how we're all going to sit at this nice table together.  That's the, that's the impression I got from their, again, bullshit fucking way  they, they presented this.  It made it sound like you were going to, it was going to be tables and, you know.  You thought the Golden Globes.  Right.  It's literally the worst award show.  So I'd rather win something at the Nuremberg trials.  It was like a mandatory assembly in high school.  Yes.  It's like you got to leave class, but you had to sit there and hear a lecture.  In, in, in the same atmosphere, the seats, the fucking, it wasn't that, it didn't seem 
[00:33:00]  like an award show atmosphere.  That's too bad.  Stunk on fucking ice.  Someone's calling bullshit on you, Ann.  I don't know why.  Why would someone call bullshit on me?  I think I'm being kind of honest here.  Let's talk to Don in Tom's River, New Jersey.  Anthony's premier package, it gives you everything but a seat and an award.  Yeah.  Don.  Is that Don on the phone?  Don from Tams River.  What's up?  Hello there, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  All right.  How am I?  Enough with the pleasantries.  Let's go.  What are you calling bullshit on?  I got to call bullshit on you, Ann.  I love you, but there's no fucking way your premier package, your little speech you had 
[00:33:30]  ready, you thought you were winning one of those awards.  You better come out and admit it.  No, I knew I wasn't going to win.  I absolutely knew I wasn't going to win.  You thought there might be a chance?  No.  Being the top vote getter and all?  Nope.  Because you would have went.  I knew it.  No, no.  I don't think you would have went if you didn't think you had a shot.  I thought I had a shot, but I didn't think I was going to win, that's for sure.  No.  No.  I thought it was just going to, you know, if I won, I won, but I wasn't expecting it. 
[00:34:00]  That's for sure.  Oh, someone wants to know if they threw in a Patriots Super Bowl championship t-shirt  in your premier package.  Piss off.  Piss off.  Can you go to Ricky Gervais' Twitter?  He's got his acceptance speech up there.  Oh, he does.  And people say it's hilarious.  Yeah, he's very good.  Because he knows that it's all bullshit.  Yes.  And I hope this is how you would have handled it, sir.  Oh, Sam Wise.  Anthony was going to take it very serious.  I bet it was really an emotional.  I was going to go, I left Dayton, Ohio. 
[00:34:30]  And the dream to win a Shorty Award.  I'm glad that dream, that didn't come true.  I think that dream came true.  It came true.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees.  Very bad knees.  What else?  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  How did that work out, I wonder.  Did he become one?  I wish we knew.  Wow.  Is he grateful for it?  What happened? 
[00:35:00]  I think God's dream came true.  Oh, it came true.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, it came true.  Oh, it came true.  Oh, you got the Gervais video?  Poor bastard with his bad knees.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  When I'd heard I'd got a Lifetime Achievement Award,  I didn't know whether it was for my brilliant writing and directing,  or my amazing stand-up and acting,  or my selfless charity work. 
[00:35:30]  But it turns out it's because I've been on Twitter for a couple of months.  So, which is even better in a way.  It's an award.  It's an award like any other award.  It's an award like an Oscar, or a Nobel Peace Prize.  Better, probably.  Better.  So, which is good and bad.  It's good that I've won this before I die,  because a posthumous award is worth fuck all. 
[00:36:00]  Fuck all.  It's bad that there's no point in carrying on life,  because I will never get this same high.  Thank you, genuinely.  Thank you very much.  I'm really enjoying being on Twitter.  I like arguing with creationists  about whether the Earth is 5,000 years old or 4.6 billion.  Who knows?  Who knows? 
[00:36:30]  What scientists do.  What scientists do?  So, thank you very much.  Have a great evening.  What scientists do?  Cheers.  At Ricky Gervais.  Follow me.  Or not.  Thank you.  Cheers.  He's great, man.  Fucking A, that's great.  He's a funny dude, man.  Yeah.  That is great.  Good for him.  Or not.  All right.  Scientists do.  Say it, because who knows?  Scientists do.  5,000 years old or 4.5 billion.  And then he just throws his arms up like, 
[00:37:00]  whatever.  Hilarious.  You sounded like you had an all right night.  Well, it sounds hideous.  You experienced something different.  It was awful.  I felt like I was stuck there.  Yeah.  I knew the moment you lost,  because your Twitter said,  fuck the Shorty Awards.  Right.  Yes, that was my code word.  I'm like, okay, he found out right there.  That was my code word for I lost.  Very subtle.  Right.  Fuck the Shorty Awards.  Fuck the Shorty Awards. 
[00:37:30]  I hate them.  Well, I want to just give a blanket apology  to the listeners and fans  that I pressured so much to vote for me  when the votes amounted to naught.  I shan't fall for anything like this again.  I will not go to the Shorty Awards.  I will not try to get nominated again.  And that's it for the Shorty Awards.  Iraq?  One other thing.  When I was looking through the program, 
[00:38:00]  I saw your name and I found Jimmy in comedy.  So I was like, well, let me see the radio category,  and it's not in the program.  Yeah.  So I asked somebody there,  I'm like, so what about radio  and a few of these other things?  Well, they're not considered official categories,  so there was no award presented to them.  Oh, my God.  I guess the ones that are in the program there  were the official categories.  So who won in radio, by the way?  I don't know.  No one?  What do you mean no one?  I guess they just,  it wasn't a real category.  Right, even though they put it on the website, 
[00:38:30]  it's not like it was created.  It wasn't a category that their panel voted on.  So you wasted all that time,  and it's having an official award set?  There's no award.  That's dumb.  That's ridiculous.  Good for the Shorty Awards.  I am officially going to block the Shorty Awards  on Twitter.  I suggest everybody,  it's at Shorty Awards,  you just block them.  I'm blocking the Shorty Awards.  Yes.  Yes.  All right, we got Shaq coming in today,  and Aziz is coming in today. 
[00:39:00]  Very fucking cool, man.  The Shaq.  The Shaq.  Do they know each other?  I've heard they do,  and then I'm a hazard.  They do, yeah.  Shaq is what, 7'1"?  7'2".  He might be 7'2".  But he's going to be another one.  Or 7'1".  When they walk down the hall,  it looks so weird.  They're so fucking big.  But the difference with Shaq,  he's also very wide.  Yes.  He's a big dude, man.  Usually when you're over 7'0",  you're pretty slim in general.  You know what I mean?  But Shaq is just a,  he's just a mess.  Yes.  Yeah, so we're very excited to meet Shaq.  He's built like, 
[00:39:30]  he's built like a defensive end,  like to be 7'0",  and to be as broad-shouldered as he,  like Kareem is a muscular guy,  but he's slim.  And he got up and down that court easily  for his size.  All right,  we're going to talk about  pussy-ass crackers next.  Ah, yeah.  Pussy-ass crackers.  Mm-hmm.  And other things.  Tell me how my ass tastes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  And now,  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:40:00]  Got me as strange as one woman.  Believe me,  there's chicks no sins.  But I'd rather get her going.  And I give out my big 10-inch  record of a band of plays of blues.  Well,  band of plays of blues.  She just love my big 10-inch  record of her favorite blues.  Getting topical.  Hold up!  Wait a minute!  With the Sex Man. 
[00:40:30]  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  I don't think any girl really  loves the big 10-inch.  You don't think that like it?  It probably hurts.  They don't like the big 10-inch?  I'm sure there are a few that do,  but I think your average girl  probably very frightened  of the big 10-inch.  I would think.  Just saying.  Maybe I'm wrong, ladies,  but probably would hurt.  Probably would bottom out.  Probably don't need all that.  You don't got a 10-incher?  No, I do not have 10-incher. 
[00:41:00]  Jesus.  That goes,  yeah, right.  That's hilarious.  I don't know.  The famous day where I heard the  ooh!  Yeah.  From the back of the van,  I just assumed  you must have had the 10-incher.  They were drunk.  What are we doing  with this 10-inch shit?  We're getting topical  with the Iraq.  And I don't fucking know, man.  Can't figure it out?  You got it?  Yeah, Santorum's got a giant cock. 
[00:41:30]  That's what it's about.  Right?  Half right.  Oh!  Well, good for fucking Santorum.  Oh, I thought that was it.  Shit.  I don't know.  I mean, what are you doing?  Let's go.  Well, going with the big giant cock thing.  Milton Berle died 10 years ago.  Ah!  Ah, very good.  Very good.  See?  See?  See?  That is...  Oh, my God.  Almost a stand and go.  It took a year.  But, uh...  See what you did there? 
[00:42:00]  That's good.  Very good.  Because, uh, legendary.  Uncle Miltie.  10 years ago at the age of 93.  Big.  10 years ago already.  Giant cock.  Milton Berle.  God, look at Iraq's all happy in there.  Oh, yeah.  Enjoy that,  because he'll be fucking up sooner.  That'll go away in minutes.  Already did.  Huh?  Already did.  Can I ask you a question?  Sure.  Will you take my Shaquille picture?  Of course.  Thank you.  I have a certain way I need it done. 
[00:42:30]  Really?  With him, with his dick in your ass?  No, but I need it just me and him  with, like, a full-length head to toe.  Of course.  Because I want to put it on my wall  next to my Kareem photo of the same way.  I'm wearing the same clothes I had  in my Kareem photo.  Oh, shit.  Because I think it would be cool  to have, like, these two Great Lakers centers,  but it's got to be our feet  all the way to our heads  so I can mock the other one.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  What about Tiny?  You didn't get Tiny on your wall?  Tiny Sturgis?  Nah, I wouldn't put him up.  The Harlem Globetrotter,  that was, what, 7'8"?  We got Dr. J and also Clyde Frazier, 
[00:43:00]  some cool ones.  I should get them all head to toe,  but I'm not going to be obsessive,  but this guy I like.  We'll probably have to do it  outside the studio,  but yeah, that's fine.  All right.  Hey, Tebow came to town,  did his press conference yesterday.  Why wasn't I told?  Oh.  What happened?  And it was a big deal, I guess,  for a lot of people.  Yeah.  And he was officially introduced  as a Jet.  He gave his, yeah,  press conference, I guess, yesterday.  This is leading to something cool,  by the way, if you don't like sports.  Ah. 
[00:43:30]  Because we noticed that he said  a certain word a lot.  Oh, really?  So we got a montage.  Well, Eastside Dave tweeted yesterday.  He was tweeting a lot from,  because he was watching  the press conference  and then tweeting his little things.  He's a Giants fan, right?  I believe so.  Yeah, okay.  He said, he was very surprised,  a huge surprise at the Tim Tebow  press conference.  He said, I love abortions.  He yelled out, I love abortions. 
[00:44:00]  But that's what Eastside Dave was doing.  He was posting these ridiculous things  that obviously didn't happen.  I love Dave.  He was trying to tweet  what he thought he was.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, wow, what a surprise.  Tebow said, I love abortions.  And then talking about his dick.  It was classic.  That's the angle.  Dave McDonald.  And I love Eastside Dave.  That was the perfect angle  to take with his horse shit.  Fucking hilarious guy.  Yeah, but he doesn't love abortions.  Oh, I know, Jim.  Tim Tebow says,  Rex Ryan is why he preferred 
[00:44:30]  New York over Jacksonville.  Really?  Yeah.  He turned down Jacksonville,  his hometown.  Of course he's going to say that.  Tebow didn't mention Jesus  until 17 minutes  into his 32-minute press conference.  He gave a 32-minute  fucking press conference?  I was like, Q&A.  And then these idiots  can't let the stupid guy go  because they want to be heard  with their dumb question.  That's why, really.  Only said Lord and Savior twice  and mentioned God once  at the end as he left.  Wow.  But he did this a lot. 
[00:45:00]  So excited about being a Jet.  So excited about it.  And I'm very, very excited about it.  I was really excited.  I'm excited.  I was excited about it.  And that would be exciting for me.  And so I'm excited to be a Jet.  And I'm excited to be here.  And I'm excited.  It's an exciting thing.  It's just exciting.  And I'm excited about the opportunity.  He was excited.  And he was excited about working with me.  And I'm excited about working.  I'm excited about that.  I'm excited about that.  I'm excited about that.  You know, I'm excited about it and I'm excited about the opportunity  and I'm excited about my future.  You know, how exciting it is. 
[00:45:30]  I'm excited to be a Jed.  It excites me.  I'm excited.  And that was exciting.  It's just exciting that I'm getting power  and I'm excited about it.  It would have been exciting.  You know, this is exciting and it's exciting for me.  I'm pretty excited.  So, you know, I'm excited and I'm excited to be on this football team  and excited to have, and that's exciting.  I'm excited about being a Jet and excited about the support.  I'm excited about being a Jet.  I'm just excited.  I'm excited about it.  All right.  Thank you all.  God bless.  Why do they keep playing the same clip over and over? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  How many times?  I don't know.  That was like 45 times or something.  Wow.  I don't know.  I don't have it in front of me.  That's crazy.  That's a lot, obviously.  Fucking Tebow.  I don't know if Sanchez is excited.  Sanchez is basically saying he's not worried.  He's the man.  Sanchez is saying, I'm the man.  Well, he's got to claim his territory, spray that tree, as the Tigers do. 
[00:46:30]  He's shitting his pants right now.  You think?  Is that how he claims his territory?  Marks his territory by shitting his pants?  He's shitting his pants.  Yeah.  Because that first home game, they're going to be chanting Tebow.  Tebow.  No matter what Sanchez does.  Tebow.  No matter what.  Yeah.  They might calm down if Sanchez completes a nice pass right away.  He's going to have to go above and beyond to keep the fans off his back.  But what if him make a touchdown?  Oh, then they'll shut up, I bet.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  45 times.  45 excited.  I hope I look good on TV tomorrow morning.  Don Imus and Jim Norton tomorrow morning.  Damn.  How'd you know?  That's pretty cool.  Kenny tells everybody.  Loud mouth.  Fucking Kenny told everyone.  Oh, okay.  You get to spill the beans.  Busy body?  Busy body.  Exactly.  Well, it's just weird how he does things.  I wasn't even sitting in his car and he told me.  Because I think he just had the news all night and had to tell somebody.  And of course we're excited for you.  No, this is...  But he's happy to do it because I've never done Imus. 
[00:47:30]  You'll have a good time at Imus.  I don't know.  I'm probably going to bomb.  No.  No.  No, not at all.  I'm still embarrassed from yesterday.  Why?  What happened?  I told you guys in the car about the...  Oh, God.  When I read that, I'm just like...  What?  Read it?  I told you in person.  Well, reading it is a different thing because then you see other people's reactions.  Wait, what?  What?  You were howling.  You were laughing so hard.  But what we...  Oh, okay.  I just didn't know what you meant. 
[00:48:00]  After yesterday's show, after the Donald Sutherland interview, we were all feeling good and  all.  And I got in the elevator by myself.  I lost you guys.  And I decided, wow, man, that went so well.  Yeah.  And then I decided to go for a pick.  Oh, boy.  A deep pick.  I was in the elevator.  It's a long ride down the lobby.  Decided to go for a nice pick.  Yeah.  Thinking about the Donald Sutherland interview and how well it was.  Does that give you physical pleasure?  Is that how you reward yourself for a good interview? 
[00:48:30]  With a good nose picking?  Are you digging your nose after a successful interview?  I'm just trying to rip up the story.  No, I do not do that, actually.  But I found my finger in my nose.  Let's just put it that way.  And then all of a sudden, I feel the elevator slowing.  Was it just in the beginning of the nose?  Oh, no.  I was digging, man.  You were way up there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There was some coverage in there I had to remove.  And all of a sudden, I feel the elevator kind of slowing down, which should have been a  clue that it's stopping on another floor.  And I'm in the elevator by myself. 
[00:49:00]  Doors open.  I swear to you, I'm fucking deep in my right nostril.  And the doors open.  And probably the hottest girl that works in this building is waiting to get on the elevator.  I wrote in my tweet a supermodel.  She was pretty much.  She was close to a supermodel.  I thought it was Fez.  See, I'm kidding.  And she stares at me in complete and utter disgust.  Of course.  I was mortified.  Of course.  She gets on the elevator.  Then I'm thinking, do I go for a joke? 
[00:49:30]  Do I try to fucking get myself out of this shit?  There's no joking your way out of that.  No, why?  Because she immediately turned around, didn't want anything to do with me and my fucking  nose picking, and just stared at the elevator door about a foot away from the door.  Should have wiped it on her back.  Yeesh.  Well, you should have went, mm, like the yummy sound.  And then it was the longest ride down in the fucking lobby.  Yeah.  Oh, it was horrendous.  I felt like a fucking idiot.  What an idiot. 
[00:50:00]  I'm a fucking idiot.  You want to put a burger in my mouth?  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.  Do you want to eat mine?  But, yeah, that happened yesterday.  Yeah.  That was a real moment.  That was humiliating.  I have to address another tweet.  Of yours.  What did I do?  What did I do?  You have to be honest.  Do you do this?  What happened?  You said, retweet.  If you also.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  If you also. 
[00:50:30]  I did well with that tweet.  Clean the piss off of the toilet seat with your socked foot.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  Yeah.  Now, please elaborate on this because no one I know does this.  You're lying.  No.  Never.  You're lying.  This was something that you presented like, oh, everyone does this.  And I was like, I know no one.  I wanted to know.  And a lot of people said, hell, fucking yeah.  No fucking way.  Dude, I'm not talking if you just spray the entire scene and it's a complete mess because 
[00:51:00]  I don't know what the fuck happens.  You know, a little couple drops.  Yeah.  There's toilet paper right there.  I don't feel like bending down.  I got herniated discs.  I use toilet paper.  Never my sock.  Sometimes I'll reach out.  But then you're walking around with piss foot.  No, because it's not like soaked.  It doesn't matter.  Even a little trace.  It's a couple drops.  So I'll lift up my foot and just do a quick little wipe.  Never.  With my sock foot.  Not every fucking time.  No, never actually. 
[00:51:30]  Never.  Not every time.  But you're walking on like your floors and your rug or something.  I guarantee if I took off my sock, you wouldn't even know I did it.  I'm not sopping up like gallons of piss.  It's a couple little drops that hit the seat or something.  Do you hit the floor when you piss?  Like, do you look in front?  Like, I always look in front of the seat.  I guess I spray and there's always something on the floor.  Oh, God, no.  What's going on there?  I always hit the floor, too.  Why?  I don't know.  That's why you got to just lay it right in the toilet.  It's like a pipe. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, mine's big enough.  Yes, of course it is.  I'm being called a fucking animal.  What is called a deep poo?  A fucking animal.  I'm being called a fucking animal now.  When I read that, I'm like, I don't know one person that does that.  I knew you didn't do it because you're really strange with fucking bodily fluids.  I do use toilet paper.  Sometimes it's quick and easy.  I do use toilet paper.  What if it's not a fresh sock?  What if it's a sock you've been hanging with all day anyway?  Your chick has to fucking do the laundry.  She's got to pick up a piss sock.  Well, that's point Opie, then. 
[00:52:30]  That makes me want to do it.  Thank you.  You want to go to the phones?  All right.  I got my people.  You got your people.  I got my people.  My people are different than your people.  This guy says he uses the knee of his jeans.  Oh, God damn no.  I'm telling you.  Come on.  Logically, the toilet paper's there, but sometimes you're already up high, so you just take your  foot and you don't want to leave anything on the seat for anybody else.  Up high?  It's right there.  It's barely, it's probably right even with your hand, and then you got to bend down maybe 
[00:53:00]  a foot.  I got lower back problems at times, bro.  Too much?  Too much sometimes.  I do with my sock and my bare foot, this guy's saying.  Oh, God.  Do you want these guys or do you want me just to read what they're saying?  Oh, my dear sweet Lord.  Here's a guy, totally old, my chick caught me sock wiping the toilet rim just the other  day and shit a brick.  This is the first time you're hearing of this, by the way?  First time, and I swear to you.  First time I've ever heard of this.  Ever.  They're calling me archaic.  It's never occurred to me to do it. 
[00:53:30]  I've done everything with piss you can do.  Right.  Literally everything, frozen it.  Scott in Quagertown, wait, Jimmy lets girls shit on his chest, allegedly, I don't know,  and is afraid of a little piss on his sock?  That's the beauty of me.  All right, good.  Hence the irony of my life.  We've got all the info out.  I would just think you'd be.  That's the first time you've heard of that.  And what if you do it more than once in a day?  Then it's.  No, no.  Then you're getting a lot of piss on the sock.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  No.  No.  Every once in a while is what I'm saying, and that's for real. 
[00:54:00]  I've never heard of it.  And yes, sometimes I will use the toilet paper, but sometimes I'm just up there.  There's a little drop or two, and I go, yeah, if I can just take my sock foot and  just fuck it.  It's usually my right, by the way, if you need to know.  Sometimes if I notice.  And all my socks have a hole in them.  Yeah.  If I notice the seat, because the seat goes up, so the rim, not even the seat.  If I notice the rim is getting a little, you know, dirty, like dried up little blotches 
[00:54:30]  there and whatnot.  Well, if you don't use your foot and you don't wipe it off, sometimes you come back in and  take another piss.  And the rim itself.  Well, that's more disgusting that you don't wipe it off at all.  No, no, it's not.  Because then you...  I've never had dry piss on my home seat.  ...you kind of spray a little bit on it to loosen it up, and then you take the toilet  paper and wipe it off, using it like an ammonia kind of cleaner.  No, I use toilet paper to wipe it off.  Look, they're across the board, but I do have...  I use the knee of my jeans.  We said that.  Knee of the jeans? 
[00:55:00]  I use my sock if I do it on the floor.  What?  I do it with my sock and my bare foot.  Opie's the man.  Yeah, I am the man.  This is craziness.  Thank you, friend DC.  That is fucking disgusting.  I do it all the time.  So far, one out of ten is saying it's disgusting, and then I got nine guys that are saying they  do it too.  Yeah.  I'm not talking like...  You don't have to be.  I don't even...  You don't have to talk any more than a couple of drops.  I just think it's...  The nose thing, that's bad.  But a little sock foot on the toilet seat every once in a while is... 
[00:55:30]  Stop doing gross things with your extremities.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  Take better care of your toes and fingers.  Snot on the fingers, piss on the feet.  Exactly.  Like a chimp.  I use boxers and socks.  Oh, my God.  You got to hear from these people.  Let's go to Mike in Hoboken.  I'm just amazed you've never heard of this before.  Never.  Never even a fucking glimmer that that might be going on.  You never even thought about it?  Never thought about it for a second.  Wow, that's weird, I think. 
[00:56:00]  It's probably weird I do it, but it's weird that you've never even heard of this before.  I don't know anybody that's done this.  Yellow.  Mike.  Yes, I'm with Opie.  Now, we're not talking huge puddles of pits on the seat.  We're talking little tiny droplets, and if my back hurts, I just dip my knee onto the seat and swipe it clean, fellas.  Yes.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  That's where you lose me.  I don't think...  No, I know I wouldn't use my jeans.  You wear dirty sweats.  Who are you kidding? 
[00:56:30]  No, I do smell the seat of my fucking jeans to see if I can get another day out of them.  Oh, my God.  That was going to be the next tweet, by the way, of my new...  Do they really stink?  What?  Do the jeans will smell?  If you wear them a few days in a row.  And I do a lot of walking around.  I'm sitting in the seat for five hours.  Sure, it can stink.  You're in dirty cabs?  Of course.  How many days do you wear your jeans?  I'll wear them four days in a row.  It will never smell.  The ass on my jeans never stinks.  One day.  You're a one-day...  One day.  What's wrong with you?  And it goes in the fucking laundry. 
[00:57:00]  Why?  Because...  You could easily get two days.  But why if I don't have to?  True.  Like, I could put it in...  No, why?  Because the second day, my jeans feel a lot better.  They feel a little stiff the first day.  They loosen up a little bit, and they just feel better.  It's probably the best.  No, I just...  I don't know.  One day, I take them off.  One day?  I think that's weird.  No, because I can.  Because, like, you know, Ange comes over. 
[00:57:30]  She does the laundry.  But it wears out your clothes faster, all that washing.  That's all right.  I guess I've got to realize I have money.  It's not like fucking...  You know, she's not out banging them on a rock in a river.  It's a modern washing machine.  I've got to start realizing I've got money, I guess.  Yeah, it's just kind of, you know...  This is all old school shit.  When I couldn't do laundry, of course you wore your jeans four or five days in a row.  Of course you did.  Hope he needs ShamWow socks.  Oh, Bob Kelly does a bit on wiping the sea with his sock?  No way! 
[00:58:00]  Does he?  And if he does, please find it for the break.  Well, he's a fucking animal.  Yeah, that's because he can't...  If he bends over, he might fall like a lamb and not be able to get off his stomach or back.  That's true.  You know what, dude?  You take your foot, you swipe it, boom.  You put your shoes back on?  Oh, God.  Now I'm being called a Nancy boy old lady faggot because I wear socks in my home.  Are you kidding me?  A lot of people wear socks in my house.  I don't wear my shoes in my house.  I don't wear shoes in the house, but of course I wear socks.  I like sliding around on the marble floor.  Somebody tweeted, I let my wife's ass wipe it off the next time she tingles. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, that's good.  What's better?  What's better than when your chick sits in your piss?  Jesus, that's just not right.  See, that's why I use my socks.  Oh, that's fantastic.  There's nothing better.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  That's it.  There's nothing better than a girl sitting in your piss.  Pick your seat up in your piss.  I sat down.  I sat in your fucking piss.  Oh, there is a God.  Good. 
[00:59:00]  I'm also being called a filthy animal because I just don't lift the seat up.  Sometimes, like, my aim's good.  Maybe a drop or two gets on the seat.  I'm like, ah, fuck.  And then I take my sock foot and sure.  Don't you hate touching the bottom rim?  I hate touching under the rim.  Oh, never.  And then you see that fucking whatever the original lip is before you put the seat down.  That's got shit caked on it from the 80s.  So I'm fucking really careful with that.  You're going to fire hose that.  Darren, does Robert Kelly have a bit on this?  Hello?  Yes.  Oh, God. 
[00:59:30]  Does Robert Kelly have a bit on this?  I'm not helping him.  No, Robert Kelly does a bit on it on stage.  I've seen him do it like two or three times.  What's the bit?  He does exactly what you said.  He pisses on the rim of the seat in the middle of the night.  Wow, we've got something in common.  I've seen Bob Kelly a lot.  Wow, okay.  He did it at the Virus store and I've seen him do it at Caroline's and a few other places.  You've seen him do it?  You might want to ask him where he can get.  He's probably just doing one of his albums or something.  Yeah, man.  You're walking around with basically a rag on your foot. 
[01:00:00]  You could do all sorts of shit with that sock foot.  Just put fucking strap Kotex on the bottom of your feet.  Look, if you drop something on the floor, like maybe, I don't know, like I'm pouring a lot of milk these days because of my son.  And if a couple drops go on the floor, I'll do the same thing.  Oh, my God.  You've got milk and pee and ketchup.  I guess.  As long as it's not a lot.  Yeah, I'll just wipe it, you know, just kind of rub my foot over shit.  Not shit.  Not shit.  Oh, my God.  See, yeah.  This guy does it on the, and you're going to lose on this one today. 
[01:00:30]  I don't, I don't.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, yeah.  I'm a big guy, and I kind of sprinkle a little bit, and I use my sock all the time.  I don't want to hear the wife bitch at me about it.  Well, use toilet paper and fucking wipe it.  I'm too lazy to bend over to get that toilet paper.  It's a little quicker if you just pick up that sock foot in, I'm telling you.  That's crazy.  Hey, listen, don't you whack off, you use your sock to clean up sometimes.  I don't do that.  No, I don't.  That I don't do.  When I was a kid. 
[01:01:00]  Nah, man, that always freaked me out using socks and shit.  I would always prepare ahead of time, get the toilet paper or tissues or something.  Yeah, yeah.  I never used a shirt or a fucking sock.  I always thought that was fucking gross.  If you're in a gas station or something like that on a long road trip, and they're out of  fucking toilet paper, I've used my undies.  For what?  To wipe.  And you just throw them away.  Well, you got to do something.  Oh, my God.  You could get away with going commando, so you could do that trick once.  It's like having a fucking engine go out on a 767. 
[01:01:30]  You're okay, but you can only, you know, you can only lose one.  I don't know if I've ever done that.  I don't think I have.  No?  Nah.  Yeah.  It's the emergency fucking procedure.  You got to improvise, adapt, overcome, hoorah.  Yeah, you got to just kind of like get your...  It's a Semper Fi wipe.  You got to just...  You got to open your asshole in such a way where you hope it doesn't get dirty.  Well, that's just it.  You got to wipe.  You got to get it looking like an opera singer. 
[01:02:00]  Oh!  Here's the guy with the bare foot ant.  Called J.G.  Wentworth.  Look at you starting.  Fucking opera shit.  Yes, what happened?  Good morning, Bill.  Hey, yeah, I don't know why.  I just...  I saw it as logical, but I'm standing there.  See some pee.  Lift up my foot.  Regardless of whether or not I have a sock on there, and I wipe it.  And then my wife sees me, and she totally wigs out.  As well she should.  No, it's just piss.  I mean, sipping stuff all the time was the big deal.  And the best thing is I don't wash my foot. 
[01:02:30]  I walk around the house barefoot afterwards.  Who cares?  See, that's...  You lose me with the bare foot.  Yeah.  Because you're just smearing the pee now.  At least the sock foot will soak it up.  I am fucking baffled here.  It's just pee.  Don't you worry that it's going to, at some point, get on your rug when you're walking around?  I'm talking...  Seriously.  It has to be just a little.  It doesn't matter.  If there's a lot of damage, then I'm going to take the toilet paper and clean it properly. 
[01:03:00]  And like the other dude, I'm just too goddamn lazy to reach over the one foot and bend over my fat stomach to get the friggin' toilet paper.  The friggin' toilet paper's right there.  See, I didn't...  I didn't...  I'm just surprised you didn't know this was going on here.  That's all.  I had no clue.  You know, you learn something new every day.  That's fucking disgusting.  I do it all the time.  I'm being called the disgusting fuck.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, Sam has the bit.  There's a lot of stress on his back, wiping it off, then using paper.  Yeah, you're on one leg.  You're like a fucking stork.  This guy uses his boxers. 
[01:03:30]  Go Pelican.  Go ahead, Dan.  Fly Pelican.  Fly Pelican.  Look, he's picking up his piss with his foot.  They're going to put the sock back in his shoe.  Dave, South Carolina.  Opie, yeah, man, I'm with you.  I use my sock, and then after I get out of the shower, I use my boxers and my white beater to clean the baseboards.  My chick's too fucking lazy to do it.  Get it done every time you get out of the shower.  Wait, you wipe down your baseboards?  Yeah, the fucking pubic hair and all the other shit that's placed at the bottom. 
[01:04:00]  What the fuck?  These chicks are doing the laundry.  Chicks are doing the laundry.  They don't touch anything.  What?  Throw it in the laundry and be done with it.  Fuck it.  I got some minority that does my laundry anyway, so fuck her.  I want a fucking big hazardous waste bag.  Oops, fired.  So fired.  Oh, my God.  Let's get some people agreeing with Anthony, please.  Someone in D.C.  Yes, sir.  Anthony, I'm just glad finally there's something I agree with you about. 
[01:04:30]  It's gnarly.  Gnarly.  Yeah, that just seems a little much.  I've never heard of it.  It's wrong.  It's like two steps away from being like, you know, a hoarder with diapers in the corner.  Yeah.  You think?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I've watched Hoarders, and it's kind of a, you know, iffy situation.  You think?  Shit in the bathroom or piss on your socks.  Just a little.  I don't know.  I know what you're saying.  It's just a drop or two.  Just a couple drops.  A couple drops.  That's even too much. 
[01:05:00]  Just a couple drops.  That's too much.  I did it at the in-laws' house over the weekend in Philly.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, man.  I want to make sure the seat's properly, you know, wiped down.  Oh, God.  No.  And my socks are nice and thick.  I keep my socks nice and thick.  I think I don't know who else's fucking goop is on there.  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  That's not my, uh, I don't roll like that, yo.  No.  Know what bit we should play?  Bob Kelly's bit on the fucking socks.  Oh, we could do that, but it reminds me of Jay Moore's bit. 
[01:05:30]  Which is one of my favorite Jay Moore bits of all time.  And I don't think he does it much these days.  Love that one.  Somebody's correcting me.  What?  If a man spills his seed on your belly, you use your tongue to wipe it up, faggot.  Our listeners are just mean to us.  I know.  Jay Moore's magic soap.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good bit.  When that soap's in the shower, the family soap, and the entire family's using it to fucking  clean armpits, their fucking big, hairy muffs, their assholes. 
[01:06:00]  And you're just assuming that the soap's okay.  Yeah.  You don't even question what the person did with the soap before you.  Yeah, he's saying like, uh.  The bit's great.  You think of the last place you wash.  Right.  And the first place you wash.  Right.  And then you come in and just use the soap.  Yeah, your mom's washing out her hairy fucking muff.  Ah.  And you get in next and you wash your face right away.  Yuck.  That's why I use a Worsh cloth.  Do you Worsh with a Worsh cloth?  I use a Worsh cloth.  I think that's why you just put soap on your face and help wash the muff.  You know, straighten.  Flop, flop, flop. 
[01:06:30]  Cuss down on soap.  Look like a rabid dog.  Yeah, you guys don't understand.  This guy, I agree with him.  Joe and Jersey.  Joe and Jersey.  Piss is sterile.  Yeah, whatever.  It really is.  Yeah, it's fine.  Weren't we going to drink piss on our show?  Smells like piss.  And then what happened?  Piss smells like piss.  What happened?  We weren't allowed to drink the piss on the show?  Yeah, they don't like us doing things like that.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, there you go, man.  You started something.  Well, I definitely want to hear the Bob Kelly bit because I want to hear his take. 
[01:07:00]  This guy wants me to sit down on the toilet.  Do you change your tampon with a sock, too?  Change the tampon?  I love that fucking cross-section drawing on the back of the tampon boxes where she's got  her foot up on the toilet, just pushing the little applicator in.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  And they show, like, that cross-section, like she was cut in half with a samurai sword.  Whoosh.  What side is this?  Now, when you used to have to grab something to read, though, when you took a dump like 
[01:07:30]  that, and sometimes you didn't have any reading material, and I would grab anything that was  close to the toilet.  Of course.  And sometimes it was a tampon box because you've got to read when you dump it.  It's just some kind of Pavlovian thing that you need to do to get the shit moving.  And I would just grab anything, and sometimes it was a tampon box, and I'd be like, oh,  look at that, the applicator.  Now, use that.  And then the toxic shock fucking warning and everything.  Now, though, you go in, and you got your iPhone, and you're just fucking tweeting, checking 
[01:08:00]  emails, stocks.  Even on the Turley, you just...  All that shit.  Same shit.  It's amazing.  Here's the Robert Kelly bit.  I swear I don't remember this bit, but good enough.  Let's go.  She also gets mad.  This is another she gets mad.  She gets mad when I go to the bathroom, because sometimes I dinkle on the seat.  Whatever.  You know, not the whole time, like an ass.  Just, ha, ha, ha.  I hate you.  I am the piss god. 
[01:08:30]  It's just a couple drippy drops at the end.  You know, when you get a shake.  But I really can't see my pay use, so I just...  I assume it went in.  I don't have time to do this.  She gets mad.  Just pick up the seat.  No.  This aggravated me.  She actually got a poem to help remind me to wipe the seat when I'm done.  It says...  She put it right over the toilet.  It says, if you sprinkle when you tinkle, be a sweetie and wipe the seedy.  That made me so mad, I wanted to pee in her pocketbook.  Just fill it up. 
[01:09:00]  Hey, honey, you got a poem for this?  I don't need a poem to help remind me, okay?  I'm fine.  If I want to wipe the seat, I have socks on.  Oh.  All right.  He'd love to make that motion right now if he could.  This is two bombs ago.  The girls don't like that joke.  But the guys are like, he's a genius.  Did you hear that?  He just made his foot into a Swiffer, dude. 
[01:09:30]  He has great tits and he's funny.  I love this guy.  Wow.  So he does it, too.  I didn't know that.  He wouldn't have said it if he didn't do it.  Of course.  He does it.  Yeah.  I've never heard of this.  I'm enlightened and disgusted all at the same time.  Why are you freaked out by bodily functions?  Because they're bodily functions.  Obviously they're gross, but even your own bodily functions, you seem to be freaked out.  I have a hierarchy of disgust.  Relating to anything that comes out of the human body. 
[01:10:00]  And my own, also.  What's the worst one for you?  The worst one, the one that gives me the most heebie-jeebies, believe it or not.  This is on your own body, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because other shit will always drive you nuts.  What annoys me the most, also, is snot.  I have such an aversion to mucus and boogers and any snotty thing.  When I blow my nose, it's a fucking procedure that I have to be in front of a mirror when  I do it and make sure every bit I take the tissue when I'm done blowing my nose and wad 
[01:10:30]  it up and put it in there and twist it around and make sure everything's got to be out of  there.  Why is it?  And I can't look at it.  I pull it out and I feel one coming out and I'm like, I won't look.  I'll kind of look in the mirror so it's at a distance, make sure I have it, and then  I'll quickly fold the tissue over and crumble it and put it in the garbage.  I can't look.  It's not.  It makes me.  It's disgusting.  You're missing the little joys in life.  You know that, right?  Oh, that ain't a joy.  Sometimes you look at that fucking toilet paper, that tissue, and you get very impressed 
[01:11:00]  by what you're capable of doing.  I cannot deal with snot.  Did you ever eat a booger and get it on the top of your teeth?  Oh, no, no, no, no, right?  You've got to stop this.  I have.  You've got to stop this.  Sometimes I have to floss my teeth after I eat boogers.  I can't even imagine eating one.  I've gotten them on the top of the teeth, never in between them, but literally in the back  teeth I've gotten a booger.  Sometimes they'll stick to the teeth in, and then you've got to take your nail, and you've  got to kind of scrape your own booger off your front teeth. 
[01:11:30]  No.  What are you doing?  I don't want to listen.  I'm going to fucking.  You're ear muffing.  You're ear muffing.  That is so disgusting.  No, snot to me is, I'm completely disgusted by it.  And then I guess in second place, coming in a close second would be shit.  Shit second to snot?  Yeah, because you don't really have to.  Shit is disgusting.  I just assumed that would be everyone's number one.  No, because you're not handling shit.  You're not really seeing other people's shit. 
[01:12:00]  You're not, you know, other people will pick their nose or blow their nose and show you  the fucking thing.  I don't see other people's shit really unless you walk in a stall and it's there, and that's  disgusting.  Do you ever have a finger pop through the toilet paper?  During what?  Wiping?  Yeah.  No.  Probably years ago when I was a kid maybe, but now I make sure I wad the paper up in  a certain fashion where there's no accidents can happen.  No accidents can happen.  What's this about, Jimmy?  I just don't want shit on my finger.  What a wacky guy I am. 
[01:12:30]  I don't want my stink finger.  Because that doesn't come off.  That's true.  No one wants that.  I'm just asking if it ever happened.  It's like Pepe Le Pew.  You could shampoo him and everything, but that stink fume little thing will wave over.  That is terrible.  What's number three?  Number three.  Snot over shit.  Yeah.  That's really surprising.  Number three.  Coming in at number three, we have vomit.  I don't like vomit.  Yeah, vomit's got to be number three.  Yeah, vomit's brutal.  And then what?  Four is pee? 
[01:13:00]  And then four would be piss.  And then five would be your cum?  I don't have a great aversion to piss, believe it or not.  I just think it's odd to put it on your sock and then walk around your house with it because  of the smell alone, I would think.  Now, I know you're saying it's just a drop or two and it doesn't affect anything, but in  my own mind.  You'll have to pump this up and say I'm soaking up like a lot of urine with my sock, but that's  not the case here, sir.  Well, in my own mind, I just can't get past the point of it being on the bottom of my sock  and then walking around the house or getting up on the couch and your foot being on the 
[01:13:30]  couch.  Where are you at with earwax?  Earwax is fucking disgusting.  Do you check it out after you wipe your ears?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I make sure, you know.  No, but I mean, do you look at the Q-tip and go, wow, look at this.  No, no, no.  Look what I got today.  Again, I will just.  You never go, look what I got today.  I'll look to make sure I got some.  These are the joys of life.  And see when it's clean, but I'll throw it away pretty quickly.  I won't ponder it.  You won't.  Yeah.  And go, wow.  Yeah.  And by the way.  Yeah.  All bets are off during sex. 
[01:14:00]  Like, then everything goes.  I'll lick an ass.  I'll fuck it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then I don't care.  Would you suck?  I'll lick where the piss comes out of.  I don't care.  I don't even fucking give a shit.  When it comes to sex, it all bets are off.  I'm good.  This guy agrees with you about snot.  Nothing better than.  Let me go to Mike in Jersey.  Mikey, go ahead. 
[01:14:30]  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I love, especially when I get a night in this season, night's allergy season, going to the  shower after a long night's sleep and put a nice big fucking air hanky right in my  hand.  Oh, God.  What?  An air hanky right in his hand.  I totally can relate to this.  When you're in the shower and you got to blow your nose in, you know you got a lot of action  in there.  No fucking way.  Instead of just blowing a snot rocket in the shower, not on the wall or anything, you  could obviously aim it toward the drain so it would be nice and clean. 
[01:15:00]  I will do it right into my hand to see what I get.  It's like Christmas.  Yeah, you look at it like a fucking eye.  And then you put your hand under the shower and watch it just kind of like go away.  I can't.  I can't even.  You ever sneeze and get some on the fucking...  You ever sneeze and see like a flick on the wall?  Like a piece of a blood booger on the wall?  Blood booger!  Right into my hand.  No, I mean from a sneeze or something.  Like you don't mean to.  Yeah.  Well, you fucking...  I've done that many times.  I was never...  I'm with this guy.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  I'll do a hand hanky.  Opie. 
[01:15:30]  Yes.  God damn it!  What?  Sam!  What, Mike?  It's a blood booger.  Everything he knows, get a nice big one and put it in your ear for later.  In your ear?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You know, I can't...  Sam, it's earwax, dude.  I'm just gonna come over there and smash that computer.  Nice.  Look at it.  It's a big fucking blood...  Why is it bloody?  It's earwax.  It's earwax.  It's not bloody.  What's the red part?  It's probably a shadow.  It's dark when it...  Oh, really?  It's dark.  Mine looks like peanut butter sometimes.  It's because it's hit the oxygen. 
[01:16:00]  What?  It's because it's hit the oxygen.  When earwax is deep in your ear, it's like black.  And then once it gets more closer to the edge where it hits more oxygen, it gets lighter.  When can you make a candle out of it?  But, like, this is deep and hard.  Like, that's like having a rock in your ear.  It's losing it.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You don't like earwax either?  Way deep back in the canal.  No, I don't like anything that comes out of the fucking body.  This guy wants to know, Ed, if you've ever jerked off while driving.  Oh, see?  No, no.  I've never jerked off while driving.  That's fucking crazy.  That's a fucking adventure. 
[01:16:30]  Why?  How could you concentrate on anything?  Well, I mean, it's a long ride from Long Island to Buffalo and Rochester, New York.  It's...  Stop at a rest stop and get yourself a blowjob from some gentleman.  Absolutely.  Why do you think they make drills with batteries in them?  A nice hole saw.  Your legs go stiff.  Like, oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It's an adventure.  You've never done that either?  No, I've never jerked off driving.  These are little joys.  That just doesn't seem like anything that...  These are little joys that you're missing out on.  Look at this earwax. 
[01:17:00]  It's got the peanut butter around it, but then it's got the dark...  I can't fucking look at any of that.  Solid chunk of earwax.  Thank God for the mic flags, because I could put it right there and not have to look at  your computer screen.  I could just move.  Look.  Did you...  I'm bobbing and weaving, Sam.  For the new listeners, because this guy's questioning this, so maybe he just heard this.  He's asking questions.  And actually did toss out a couch because of one booger.  Yes, a kid wiped a booger on it.  That is a true story.  I couldn't find it.  He couldn't find it.  He was looking for it, and they were like, oh, you know, I can't find it. 
[01:17:30]  And the kid's laughing, and his father's just like, oh, well.  I was like, that's it.  Get this fucking...  I wanted to show Bob Kelly this video the other...  I'm not watching.  ...the other day, and I couldn't find it.  I'm not watching.  It's weird.  I'll just look at it.  It's not that...  Nope.  It's called Guy Gets Nose Professionally Picked.  I don't need to watch that.  And it's subtitled Wait For It.  Wait For This.  I'm not waiting for anything. 
[01:18:00]  I'm not watching it.  Yeah, please watch.  I'm not going to watch it.  Please watch.  Nope.  Doctor's in there.  Nope.  Why would a guy have to do that?  Like, I don't...  Watch.  Look at how much comes out of his fucking...  See, I'm not watching it.  That's an oyster.  That looks like a tuna.  And it was as big as an oyster.  No joke.  Look at that.  That's great.  Look at that.  Could you please look at it?  How could he not?  I wonder if that's post-surgery.  And for the show.  For the show, could you please look at it?  Please.  Can you imagine eating that?  Go back.  Go back.  Yeah, just...  You gotta look at it for a second, dude.  For the show.  For the show.  It's more...  It doesn't even look like a booger.  It's bizarre. 
[01:18:30]  It's the size of an oyster.  Don't try to talk it down.  Please.  Just go fast forward a little bit so he doesn't have to watch the whole thing.  And please look.  It looks like it's fake.  For the show.  All right.  All right.  Doctor's in there with his, like, tweezer-y things, whatever the fuck they're called.  He got a hold of it.  Now he's slowly pulling it out.  Look at this.  Yeah!  Goddamn, you son of a fuck!  What is that?  It's as big as an oyster.  What is it?  Do you know what that would smell like if you held it under your nose?  That looks like a baby mouse that was just born. 
[01:19:00]  It looks like a fucking...  It looks like a small, wet rock.  That's fake.  No, it's not.  No, it's not fake.  Look, they show it afterwards.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  No, that's got fucking blood and mucus in it.  Yeah, man.  Ant is completely creeped out.  I can't...  Oh, where are you at with spit, Ant?  Good question.  Spit and pus, and then we can move on.  Oh, my God.  Pus is really fucking disgusting.  Pus isn't that bad, actually.  Pus is so disgusting.  I can't watch those...  Oh, God.  Zit-popping videos?  Yeah, let me see.  Fucking son of a bitch.  I won't watch that. 
[01:19:30]  Any of those big zit-popping videos.  And boils.  People are popping and lancing online.  And spit...  Spit is the weirdest thing.  It's in your mouth.  Right.  You could even collect a bunch in your mouth and swallow it, and it doesn't bother you.  The second it leaves your mouth, it cannot return from whence it came, because that becomes  disgusting.  You would never, like, spit it out in a glass and then fucking drink it.  I'm not watching. 
[01:20:00]  But when it's in your mouth, it's fine.  But it's the same thing.  We got tablespoons today?  Let's see how many people on staff could spit into a tablespoon and then, and then you're  right, put it back in your own mouth.  Why is that?  It's disgusting, but it shouldn't be.  Right?  So let's spit into spoons and then put them back in our mouths.  I'm not watching that.  No?  Come on, sir.  You don't want to do that?  No.  Well, I won't do it.  It's not that bad.  But, like, why do it?  Yeah, I guess.  You know? 
[01:20:30]  But it's not like snot to me or anything.  Saliva, you know?  We should break, because we've got to talk about this Trayvon.  Trayvon!  Latest news on Trayvon Martin.  Yeah, I found his Twitter.  All right, we'll talk about it next.  I found his Twitter, and I was looking at a bunch of posts.  And I heard you were having fun with that yesterday.  Yeah, I was actually retweeting with comment on some of his tweets.  They were very gangsta-ish.  By the way, another guy that can relate.  And he said, I jerked off driving to Rochester just last weekend and missed my exit. 
[01:21:00]  He's a concentrating guy.  There's another hoodie protest happening?  Really?  This Thursday through Sunday at Caroline's?  212-757-4100.  We're all going to see Jimmy at Caroline's.  Are you coming?  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, good, good.  It's Saturday, I think.  Yeah, Saturday is sold out.  We'll get you in, of course.  Oh, God, you suck.  I'll just go up against the wall. 
[01:21:30]  You should have waited.  Maybe I should go Thursday.  I'm not going to look.  Maybe I'll go Thursday.  Sam put it up on Apple TV, so it's up on one of the big screens.  What is he digging for?  Guy's going to be popping a fucking thing on his back.  No, that's on his...  If that's his back, it's got issues.  Look how much hair there.  It's on the side of his face.  I'm not looking.  So what's the big deal?  There's nothing.  This I won't look at.  What's the big deal, Sam?  It's disgusting.  Is this an epic fail we're about to see?  No, it's too grossed out.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  Are we getting to Arlen Spectrum's studio? 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  We are.  No.  Okay.  I don't know.  What happened, Arlen?  You're fired.  Can we play the Jay Moore clip?  Oh, sure.  Might as well.  Come on.  I'm surrounded by this stuff.  I got a take over here.  Oh, look.  You got it.  Oh, you got the Jay Moore?  All right.  We go to break with the magic soap bit from Jay Moore.  I really love this bit.  Last time I saw Jay, I was kind of bummed.  He doesn't do this anymore.  He really should bring this one back.  All right.  I didn't have any problems in Scotland.  I had problems in England, France. 
[01:22:30]  I thought it was a little shady to French.  They don't wash their ass.  Soap's amazing.  I love soap.  We love, we're soap obsessed in this country.  You could, you could have soap in your shower, right?  And you drop it, guys.  And even if, even though you know you're safe in your house, you go, this is where I get  raped in prison.  Okay.  I dropped it again.  I must be the new guy.  Wow. 
[01:23:00]  What am I?  Luke Perry and Oz?  What the heck?  Soap is awesome.  Soap's magical.  You could have a soapy hand, wash the crack of your ass, right up to your face.  And don't moan because you did it today.  That's the only thing in the world you can do that with, is that magic soap. 
[01:23:30]  Believe me, I've thought of everything.  You can't pour applesauce out onto your hand, rub it on your whale eye, then bring it back  up to your face.  You'd be like, what the hell is wrong with me?  I just put applesauce and ass on my face.  You come from a big family.  Maybe there's eight, seven people in your family.  Maybe there's, maybe there's ten people in your family.  How many bars of soap? 
[01:24:00]  You better hope it's magical, like I'm telling you.  One bar of soap for everybody.  I was the youngest of five.  That meant I was the last one in.  All I wanted was three minutes of hot water so I could shower and go to school.  I didn't think for a minute.  My dad was just in there washing his sack for 20 minutes. 
[01:24:30]  My mother's washing her ass.  My sister's washing her hooch.  I go in right behind all of them.  I'm like, I have no hot water.  I am free.  You people are inconsiderate.  I'm freezing.  No wonder you don't get along with your family.  You're all having sex with each other by proxy.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Fuckin' love my tool. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, and the band.  Sounds odd.  Music news really fast, Ant.  Remember that?  Remember?  Like MTV.  MTV music news.  I don't know.  I think this is kind of important.  You know that band Jet?  Jet.  They are announcing that they are breaking up.  And I mention that because rock in general just feels like it's going away. 
[01:25:30]  The rock we kind of know and love.  Well, there's new rock for people.  Well, it's loosely called rock a lot of these bands.  But I like that band Jet.  But they're Dunsky.  How long were they around?  Probably five, six.  I'm going to go seven years.  What's their big song?  This one.  Oh, yeah.  Remember this thing?  I've been riding all night, man. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, man.  You sound just like it, too.  It sounds like a radar love.  Yeah, it does sound like radar love a little bit at the beginning.  Good job.  Oh, yeah.  I love these guys.  The few songs I downloaded, whatever.  I wasn't all in.  I wasn't buying albums.  A couple of their songs.  I know we had a couple of movies.  What?  This song made it into a couple of movies.  You think?  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Anthony, Russ Robinson in Philadelphia writes,  Love you guys, but do you really have to keep beating up the murdered kid every day?  What?  We're not beating up the murdered kid every day.  Don't beat up Trayvon.  What are you talking about?  This is a massive fucking story, and we're trying to look at it from many different angles,  unlike some people out there that have an agenda, like Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.  Unbelievable.  They're being called racist hustlers today.  Yes.  By some former NAACP member.  Yes.  Is he on the phone, this guy? 
[01:27:00]  No, no.  I figure, of course not.  That's, you know, the second you take another viewpoint, and you're not making assumptions  or anything, but you're just putting facts out there and what people are saying.  Ah, you're all of a sudden a piece of shit that's trying to make fun or make light of  the kid dying.  No.  Nobody beat up Trayvon Martin, you scumbag.  Nobody said, it's terrible that he got shot.  You're saying you can't have a witch hunt for George Zimmerman until you know what happened.  Yeah.  What's the fucking, if he's guilty and just shot this kid, then he should go to prison 
[01:27:30]  for the rest of his life.  It's on the front page of every paper, so we, of course, have to discuss it, and we get  everyone's point of view on the air.  We try, at least.  And tragedy is hijacked by race hustlers, is the headline in our papers today.  A lot of people are very upset that Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are race hustlers who have  exploited the tragic shooting death of Trayvon Martin, and I'm glad to see that.  Exactly.  I think a lot more people are on to stupid Reverend Al Sharpton and stupid Jesse Jackson. 
[01:28:00]  Is that what they're on now?  Stupid Jesse Jackson?  Is that bad to say?  No, it isn't.  It's good to say.  I just wish that would be in front of their names where Reverend goes.  And I would like to ask MSNBC, why are you allowing Reverend Al to get involved with this  big-time news story, and then he reports on his own news that he's making?  Yeah.  It's very confusing.  Well, they lean forward.  They sure do. 
[01:28:30]  That's a different thing, leaning forward.  That means you could have a complete conflict of interest when it comes to one of your guys  getting on.  I know his show, he does more of an editorializing show than news.  It's loosely based on news.  Yeah, so...  I lean forward, by the way, Ant.  Do you lean forward?  Well, yesterday I did.  It was very windy in New York.  Yeah, yeah, you had to lean forward.  It's the only way to get around sometimes.  You should lean forward in the bathroom when you're wiping piss off the toilet seat instead  of using your foot.  Be like MSNBC.  Lean forward. 
[01:29:00]  My father-in-law is listening, and he wants to know if I have warts on my feet.  Why?  Will piss do that?  I guess.  But I don't do the bare feet.  No.  Yes, bare feet.  That's what I use my fur.  See.  Here we go.  So, what's the latest on Trayvon Martin?  We got...  Trayvon, well...  Former NAACP leader accuses Reverend Alan Jesse Jackson of exploiting.  Trayvon Martin case, calling them race hustlers.  Yeah, because they're constantly by the family's side. 
[01:29:30]  Just stirring up more racial divide, because that's what they do.  The other bullet point today, pussy-ass cracker shirts with picture of George Zimmerman hit  the streets in Florida.  Yeah, I got one.  It's great.  I would actually love to get one of those.  I would love to wear one.  Pussy-ass cracker.  It's a horrible shirt, though.  But he's not even a fucking...  No, he's not a cracker.  Look at this fucking dummy.  This dumb motherfucker.  He's wearing a shirt with a Latin guy on it.  Pussy-ass cracker.  Can we ask the black community today, are Hispanics considered crackers? 
[01:30:00]  I didn't know that.  I don't think so.  They're not.  Of course not.  Okay, good.  He's a dope who saw the news...  Yeah, go ahead, sir.  So, he's a dope who saw the news and thinks that it's a fucking white guy.  Yeah.  He's a dummy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Zimmerman's not a cracker.  And George Zimmerman coming out telling cops that Trayvon decked him in the head and then  started pummeling him on the sidewalk.  Witnesses corroborate his story.  Is there injuries from that?  Yeah, yeah.  He had a broken nose.  Back of his head was cut and he had a broken nose. 
[01:30:30]  Lacerations about his face.  He was bleeding from the nose and mouth.  And they cuffed him.  He told them that he did have a gun.  They took it from him.  They cuffed him.  And they brought him down to the old station house for about five or six hours of questioning.  And during that time, they got his side of the story.  They got witnesses.  And they also got physical evidence from the scene and determined at that point, at that 
[01:31:00]  point, that an arrest was not necessary.  Did they get witnesses, though?  Because I've heard mixed stories that they didn't and that they did.  Yeah.  On the actual police reports, you can read where they got their witnesses during that time.  The cops that were on the scene canvassed the area, got witnesses.  There's a list of the witnesses.  You read the police report, it reads like this.  Trayvon was walking around in this neighborhood. 
[01:31:30]  Jorge Zimmerman was driving around in his SUV doing his neighborhood watch duties, whatever  that entails, looking for people that, I guess, based on his opinion, didn't look like they  belonged in the neighborhood.  That's what neighborhood watch they do.  So he then got out of his vehicle because he saw Trayvon, asked Trayvon what he's doing  in the neighborhood, and Trayvon kind of took off, took off on him and went to hide somewhere 
[01:32:00]  is what was said.  He called 911, Zimmerman, said that there's a suspicious character.  He said, I'm following him.  We all know now that the 911 operator said, don't do that, and Zimmerman said, okay.  Now the story's coming out that when he said okay, he then turned around and was walking 
[01:32:30]  back to his vehicle.  That's when he says Trayvon jumped him from behind, punched him in the face, pinned him  to the ground, and started punching him in the face.  He then pulled his gun out.  He yelled for help for a while.  Some people, at least one person, showed up, heard him yelling for help, didn't help him.  He was yelling for help for a while, and those are allegedly the screams that you hear on  the 911 call are from Zimmerman. 
[01:33:00]  When nobody helped him, and I guess he felt at that point that if he was to get knocked  out or pass out, this guy would then have access to his gun.  Whatever reason it is, he felt his life was in danger.  He pulled his gun out and shot him at very close range in the chest, and he died on the  scene.  The cops came that were responding to the initial suspicious person call.  They now have a gunshot call.  They handcuffed him, took his gun, and took him down to the station for statements. 
[01:33:30]  But that's now the story that's coming out is it wasn't so much he kept pursuing him after  the 911 operator said he was walking, but it's now said that he was walking back to  his vehicle.  Whether this had happened or not, look, don't fucking crucify me, motherfucker.  I'm just telling you what is now, what now is coming out.  More details of the police report is coming out.  My question is, how would anybody know that he was saying something on the 911 call?  How would anybody know when he went back to his vehicle? 
[01:34:00]  How would they know what he was saying on the phone?  What he was saying on the 911 call?  How did witnesses know that he was walking back to his car after the operator said that  when they couldn't hear the conversation?  Uh, I guess they asked him which way was he walking.  Oh, okay, but they know when it happened.  Yeah, yeah.  I hadn't heard that yet, so.  Yeah, that just came out last night.  The police report was released, and there's a lot of shit in there.  As far as Trayvon goes, I know that assassination of character has nothing to do with the actual 
[01:34:30]  case, but a lot of things are coming out, I guess, on his.  You don't want to assassinate his character, you just want to tell the story accurately.  No, exactly, exactly.  Tell the story accurately.  What's going on?  He just got here.  Shax here early?  Holy shit.  That must be him.  Oh, yeah, bring him in, man.  I'll see if he's ready.  Like his head is, he would hit the exit sign, it looks like. 
[01:35:00]  Wow, he's massive.  That must be a bitch to fucking go around like that.  I guess we'll jump back on this at some juncture today.  Yeah, of course.  I think we should finish it with him right here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course, we'll finish it.  So, you dove body wash.  I know.  It's a weird day to be promoting dove.  You and your dove body wash.  Don't talk about basketball, I just want to talk about my body wash.  The publicist says, I just can talk about my body wash.  Oh, we got to save Kareem Abdul-Jabbar from his publicist. 
[01:35:30]  Poor bastard.  Shaq is making his way down the hall.  Yes, he is.  Fuck, he's a legend.  He's driving toward the window.  One of the greatest NBA players of all fucking time.  Yes.  Some say the greatest center of all time.  Oh, my God.  I'd still give it to Abdul-Jabbar.  He's right the fuck up there.  Oh, my God.  He can't.  Look, he ducked under the exit sign, dude.  I'm not even fucking kidding.  I see that.  Look at that exit sign right there.  He has to duck under it. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, he's got those cool headphones, too.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I know Travis.  He's very tall.  Yes, we know who he is.  We understand.  Oh, I like how quiet we get before that.  Well, you know, you want to be actually nervous.  I'm a little nervous.  Are you really?  Oh.  Sometimes I get nervous with these things.  Sweetie.  I love basketball.  Oh, my God.  God, he's so tall.  Damn.  Holy shit.  That's craziness.  I'm a little starstruck when he sees me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, of course, it's you, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Does he know you, you think? 
[01:36:30]  No.  Well, no.  No?  No.  He's got to duck his head to get through that door.  Yeah.  This is going to be crazy.  Yeah.  I love his headphones.  What are they?  Love the headphones.  Huh?  Are they beats?  Yes.  Are they beats?  I prefer bows.  Yeah, yeah.  This is going to get ugly.  You could just walk right in.  Bring him right in.  We're pretty frigging loose when it comes to actually doing a show.  How you doing, man?  How you doing, man?  How you doing, man?  How you doing?  Anthony, how you doing, man? 
[01:37:00]  That's, uh...  Hey, Shaq.  Pleasure, man.  How you doing?  I like the beats you had on.  Very good.  You know this guy?  I know everybody.  Yeah?  I know everybody.  Jimmy Norton?  We've actually never met.  No?  No.  But Shaq has helped some comedians, so I'm certainly hoping that you're up for helping some more.  We made Kevin Hart famous.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Jimmy knows Kevin Hart real well.  Yeah, we kind of came up together.  Even though I'm a lot older than him and he shot past me, but I'm happy for him.  It's always good to see a friend shoot by you. 
[01:37:30]  What got you involved in the roast?  Like, did you want to be roasted or are you just a fan of comedy?  Well, I'm a fan of comedy and I saw it was a big void in comedy, so I just made all the  comedians' offers they couldn't refuse.  Oh, good money and TV?  Exactly.  Did anybody say no to that?  No.  That's kind of what they said.  Why would they say no to that?  That sounds like a great fucking opportunity.  Were you sensitive about any of it?  Like, was there anything with you?  No.  I mean, I probably have the greatest sense of humor ever. 
[01:38:00]  I like to laugh.  I like to make people laugh.  And, you know, like I said, it was a void there and nobody was really doing it.  Russell was doing it first and then, you know, I turned on HBO and it's not there anymore.  So, I tried it at an All-Star game.  Because, you know, at All-Star events, everybody's there.  So, I said, let's do it at an All-Star game.  And my partner, Jeff Clannigan and I, we did it and it was such a success.  He was like, you know what?  This can't be true.  Let's do it again.  And we did it again. 
[01:38:30]  And we recorded it.  We said, let's sell it and see how people like it.  We sell over 400,000 copies every time we drop.  And none of it made you go like, ugh.  No.  No.  Because, you know, I like to laugh.  And, you know, it would be like coming up here and telling you guys what to say and how to say it.  That's what the bosses do.  Yeah.  That's their job.  Obviously, they don't because you guys are one of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Thank you very much. 
[01:39:00]  Roland probably said that on the way in.  Just tell them they're popular.  They'll be really good to you.  That's why we like it here because they don't bother us as far as that shit goes.  For the most part, yeah.  Hey, we're all smelling like your Dove products.  We have to say it.  Yes.  They gave it to us last week.  Yeah, we honestly at first didn't even know why they were bringing in the products.  And we're like, oh, wow, this is good.  Yeah.  And then I started seeing the commercials.  And we've been using the body wash.  That's why you're here for the most part, right?  Well, obviously, you guys have always been comfortable in your own skin.  And, you know, it's a great product. 
[01:39:30]  I've been using it even before we joined the strategic partnership.  But, you know, I thought it was a great commercial.  You know, my mom came by the house to check on me.  And I was like, you've got to be in this commercial with me.  And it's a great commercial.  And, you know, the Dove Men's Care product is a great line, especially the body wash.  I actually like the size and the price.  Yeah.  Because I'm a guy who like to keep my stuff clean during the day. 
[01:40:00]  It is a big size, too.  But it smells good.  It's like the deodorant is actually really fresh.  Yeah.  And I put it on, and I'm very pleased with myself.  Ah, you should be.  Yeah, we were hoping you would notice that we smell like your product.  Yeah, but it's just kind of awkward to fucking lean in and smell me.  Right.  You get a lot of endorsements, which is great.  I mean, you're kind of one of the sports stars that have really done well as far as endorsements.  Can we meet or Shaq?  Not you.  We're waiting for our first endorsement.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I've taken care of business since I came in. 
[01:40:30]  And, you know, whenever I meet with a company, I always tell them I'm not really interested in endorsement,  but, you know, in a strategic partnership.  And I've also been the type that if I'm not comfortable with the product or if I've never used your product,  then I'll be an honest businessman and not take your money.  Have you ever worried about things that you say?  Because you've said some controversial, albeit funny, but some people see it as controversial.  Not at all.  Yeah?  Because to me, image is reality.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Those that come in with the suits and create their image, they're the ones that have to watch out.  So you figure there's nothing they can get you on where you can fall because you're going to say it.  Well, okay, this is me.  No, not really.  You know, people see me, they know that I'm a humble guy.  They know that I'm a funny guy.  They know I'm always saying what's on my mind.  You got some great quotes, too, man.  Oh, my God.  Some people would say they should use that soap to wash your mouth out with Mr. Rillian.  No way.  I'm a role model.  No way.  Your Kobe quote to this day makes me howl, man. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know what you're talking about.  He don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just saying, man.  It makes me fucking howl.  But it's refreshing to see guys say what's on their mind.  Guys like Barkley always talked.  And it's like, I don't want to hear somebody giving the company line.  That's not interesting to me.  And then, you know what?  Being a marketing expert, I know what's going to get everybody riled up.  Right.  You know, like I know when to say it and how to say it.  That incident, I was at one of those little comedy clubs.  They called you up on stage. 
[01:42:00]  And I did a little rap.  And somebody recorded it and sold it for $500.  You know, they tried to make a big deal out of it.  Yeah.  That was at Norm's Place down in the village.  Was it the Fat Black Pussycat, I think?  It was one of those.  Because the comedy store was right around the corner.  It was like one of those little underground clubs.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe the village underground.  But you know what?  The funny thing is when this stuff gets out, everybody talks about it like you're going  to get a spanking.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you see what Chuck said today?  It's true.  Yeah.  That's kind of the society we're living in these days, though, where everybody's walking  on eggshells. 
[01:42:30]  But what I respect about it, he didn't apologize.  No, no.  He just let it happen and just went with it.  Because, you know, I was at a comedy club.  I was at a setting.  Right.  Context.  And I know I rocked the crowds.  About 500 people are having a good time.  Yeah.  You know, it's just, you know, people use that to, you know, create their show.  I just love that.  I understand.  As a sports fan, you know, I understand you guys got to have sportsmanship to a point,  but it gets sickening after a while.  I like when you guys are real about losses and certain plays and players.  Everyone knows that I'm a little comedian. 
[01:43:00]  Those that can't take it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I get a sense of humor.  Buy one.  Yeah.  They're on the internet.  $4.99.  It's a sense of humor.com.  Well, you're one of those big guys, too.  It was interesting to read that when you were coming up that you would always try to make  people laugh and be the funny guy.  Like, you're either the funny guy or the bully.  Like, you were either going to get big laughs from somebody or they were going to go home  with fucking jaw shattered.  So you had, like, two options.  Which I think was interesting.  When you'd move to a new place, you would just try to make people laugh first before you  would try to dominate them another way. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, because, I mean, I'm a really funny, sensitive guy.  And I never wanted to have to fight.  But when they used to say Shaquilla and Sasquatch, that's it.  Kicking your ass right now.  Three o'clock.  Who the hell would say that to you?  A lot of people.  Wow.  How dumb do you have to be?  Yeah.  At what point does that stop?  I had to bust a lot of heads.  Well, it stopped like after the first couple weeks when I got there.  Yeah.  Because, you know, it's just like, you know, those jail movies.  You get there and you find out who the toughest kid is. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  I was like, this guy right here with the ponytail in the back?  This chick right here.  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm going to kill this guy.  So you see him at three and you steal on him and you beat him up in front of everybody.  And then the next day you get major respect.  Right.  That really bothers you.  Yeah.  I wouldn't know about anything like that.  No.  I miss Shaq in the NBA because, you know, there's not a lot of personality right now.  Not a lot of guys stepping up and just being, you know, personable and saying some crazy stuff.  Yeah.  At all.  Who would you say is in the league that?  Nobody.  Really, right? 
[01:44:30]  It's different.  LeBron is a bore when he's not playing.  I always tell my kids that, you know, when I was coming up, the league was more fabulous  than it is now.  Right.  Every team, even the bad teams.  Just think about, like, in the 80s, even a team like Denver, Alex English, you know,  every team had a great player.  Right.  Anybody ever tell you you look like Boomer Esiason?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You look like Boomer.  I went to school with Boomer back in...  Anthony had a fight with Boomer Esiason.  In fifth grade, I punched him in the forehead and broke my arm. 
[01:45:00]  A dick-headed motherfucker.  You look like a dick-headed.  Yeah, Anthony punched him.  Yeah, yeah.  Broke both fucking arms.  Broke my arm.  Both bones in your right arm.  I've done, like, golf tournaments with him, though, after that.  So he's cool.  I like Boomer.  He's a fun guy.  Yeah, he's all right.  You're very business savvy, obviously.  When did that start?  Like, you're going for the sport part of it.  You're good at basketball.  You know, that's going to be part of it.  When do you start to realize that that's necessary?  One day, I was on punishment, and my father came in, and he hit me in the head with a book. 
[01:45:30]  And he said, if you ever start being a leader and a follower, you could become somebody.  So anyway, I read the book, and the book was about Kareem and how he lost everything.  So one of my fears as an athlete or as a professional person was losing everything.  He invested in soybeans, Kareem, right?  That was a big loss for him.  We had Kareem in here, and we weren't really allowed to ask him any basketball questions.  He had a publicist. 
[01:46:00]  We felt sorry for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, believe it or not.  He was having a great time, but afterwards, she wasn't too thrilled that we talked about basketball as well as the book.  We didn't even get to ask him about that.  His personality.  He lost it all, what, back in the 70s?  Yeah, soybeans and everything.  Bad investment, wow.  It was always one of my fears coming up.  And those guys didn't make as much money back then, so the investing was important.  When I first came in, I was making a lot of money.  I think my first year, I didn't make a lot.  I don't want to say the number, but it was a lot. 
[01:46:30]  It would probably depress the listeners.  I mean, we understand that kind of money, but they would.  You asshole.  And another time, I was in the arena.  Hey, buddy.  The dude scared me.  Oh, he rocked you.  Yeah.  It's like you're looking at an animal behind a glass wall, isn't it?  He's very athletic as he chews something there.  So then I met Magic Johnson, and Magic Johnson told me, you know, he grabbed me by the arm,  and he's like, it's good to be the man, but you want to start owning stuff.  And I was like, what the hell is Magic talking about?  But then, like, as I, you know, played in L.A., and I saw the stuff he was doing in the community 
[01:47:00]  and development, and I was like, you know what?  Let me do that, and while I'm doing it, let me go back and get my master's,  because, like, when I have conversations with people, of course they're going to look at me as Shaq,  but I want them to know that I understand.  Like, when I go in with CEOs, and they know I got my master's in business,  they know that they can't let anything's hurt.  They can't mess with you.  No coin, no nothing.  And now I'm getting my Ph.D. May 5th in HRD, organizational leadership.  Dr. Shaquille O'Neal?  Yes, me, Dr. O'Neal. 
[01:47:30]  What's HRD?  Human Resource Development.  So when you, how do you find, this is the scary part for me,  is because most guys, you get a business manager,  and it's scary to find somebody that you can trust who you know isn't going to rip you off.  Like, do you just go on, I check my stuff all the time, and there's not much to check,  but I'm obsessed with the idea that somebody's just, I'm going to just have to see zeros one time.  Steal his money and make it to Newark.  Well, you have to, you have to, like, you know, trust people.  Like, when I came in, I interviewed the top four firms, and three of them even said in, like, you know, 
[01:48:00]  Kareem's book, like, if it's too good to be true, stay away from them.  So one guy came in, hey, I noticed you made this much, we can double it and triple it, he's out.  Right.  Another guy, we'll do this and we'll do that, he's out.  And I met a little guy, a little Jewish guy, and said, hey, I can put it in savings bonds,  I can get you some annuities, and I can manage your money, make sure it's like, I like that guy.  Yeah, we got the little Jewish guy, too.  Yeah, you got to go, you got to go.  Baruch Hashem, Shalom, Lashanot.  You got to go a little Jewish guy every time. 
[01:48:30]  You just have to.  You got to.  You just got to.  That's very, that's very smart, I'm telling you it's smart, because as far as being an athlete goes,  you never really know when that machine is just going to stop working, as far as that,  and, you know, you could have a long, illustrious career, make a lot of money, or you could be done in a year.  Yeah, you could be done in a year.  Yeah, like when I first came in, and my agent told me I was going to be making this much, I'm like, seriously?  But, I mean, in the real world, when you're done playing, there's no way you're going to make that much. 
[01:49:00]  No way.  Right, so you got to.  No way, unless you get one of them Google, Facebook, IPOs.  And there's no way, so you got to save it, or you got to make it work.  What do you think the difference is between somebody like you that actually realized that,  and people that just decide they're going to kind of play it with it?  Fear, you think?  Yeah, fear.  Was that from your stepfather, you think?  Like, kind of drilling it into you?  Yeah, stepfather, just being fear, and just, you know, not, you know, just being able to live the same lifestyle. 
[01:49:30]  Like, you know, for a guy that doesn't have any business savvy, the only word he should memorize is annuity.  Yeah.  Put money away, and then at a certain age, you get to take it out for the rest of your life.  That's it.  No investments, no buying businesses, no trying to do restaurants, just annuity.  That was the first thing I did.  It'll be there when you're, you know, ready to relax.  It'll be there when you're done.  Is that annuity's money that you don't get taxed on, and then you can't, I like to, I sound like I'm saying it, but I'm really asking.  It's tax-deferred.  Tax-deferred until you take it out.  You start using it. 
[01:50:00]  You defer that shit.  And then sometimes you get a lower tax rate based on, you know.  I met a guy one time, he had a hundred dollar bill, and he ripped it in half, and he said, you put that 50 away, and annuity, you never touch it, you got 50 left.  Now, the smart ones that rip that 50 in half, and you save 75, and you play with 25, and that's what I tried to do.  But, Chuck, you can't spend half the bill.  Well, he was just trying to.  Smart guy.  I've never wanted to see a fist fly in front of me so bad. 
[01:50:30]  You know, Shaq, you know a few guys that were pretty, pretty big stars in the NBA that are broke.  I don't know if you want to mention names.  They say they're broke.  I don't really know their finances.  Yeah, there's a few guys off the top of my head that didn't do a lot of the stuff you're saying, and they are in a desperate situation right now.  No, like I said earlier, because of fear, I never wanted to be in that position.  Like, I never, you know, first thing they did was buy my mom and parents a house.  Like, I said to myself, I'm going to work hard, so they don't ever have to get their phone call. 
[01:51:00]  Like, hey, the house is not there.  I would do that so you could have somewhere to live if everything fucks up.  Yeah, I know, right?  Watch your house.  When did you know it was time to, like, when you're playing, it's always interesting to me when an athlete steps down.  Like, that's got to be the hardest decision you have to make.  Like, what told you it's time to just go on to something else?  It wasn't hard.  I was used to playing at a super high level, so then when I started playing at a regular level, it just didn't look good or feel good.  Like, I can remember one time in Boston, I only had six points.  I was like, this shit ain't me.  I mean, it's still fascinating. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, I can mother...  Like, this isn't me.  And, you know, it doesn't last forever.  You know, luckily, I have things to fall back on, and I wish I could have did a little bit better at Boston last year, but I ripped my Achilles in half.  You know, my goal was to win the whole thing and then just walk away.  That would have been a nice way to end the story, but, you know, I had fun and had a great press conference, and, you know, we moved on.  Who was the first guy you played against that kind of, like, was one of your idols, or the first time you had to face somebody on the court that made you nervous? 
[01:52:00]  Patrick Ewing.  Ewing?  Really?  That was when I came here to the guard, and articles, and Patrick Ewing tried to break my thumb when he gave me a fist bump.  Oh, shit.  But I knew marketing-wise that if you can play in New York, you can play anywhere.  So I shot it, and I made it, and it felt pretty good.  I was like, so you know what?  I'll do it.  Suffering Knicks fan right here.  We would have loved to have you.  Jeez.  All these years, it's been a drought for the Knicks.  What do you think of the Knicks team right now, and Jeremy Lin and all that? 
[01:52:30]  Pretty good.  But, you know, I've been waiting for Carmelo and Amari to step up.  Amari's out, though.  Yeah, he's out.  For probably the rest of the year.  You know, Carmelo's a great player, but at some point in his career, he's going to have to take it personal that they talk about him fifth.  You know, when I was coming up, even though they had Ewan and Robinson, I was like, I'm going to make you guys talk about me first.  I don't care who was there.  So, you know, he's a great player.  He just has to, you know, step up and lead. 
[01:53:00]  And I tell him this every time I see him, like, hey, we need more out of you.  It's not enough to, you know, hit shots every now and then.  You've got to put up big numbers and you've got to dominate.  Do you think Jeremy Lin's the real deal?  A lot of hype, obviously.  No, he's a good player.  But, you know, what he did, you know, kid, came out of nowhere and brought the Knicks from seven games to, you know, brought them to 500 and then, you know, reality kicked in.  But, you know, he's a smart player.  He's a smart player. 
[01:53:30]  Have you really been training in MMA since 2000?  Yes.  What do you take and do you like to watch it?  Oh, I love to watch it.  I think those guys are phenomenal athletes.  I'm kind of jealous of them.  I wish, you know, we could have did some of that stuff in the NBA.  But, you know, they're great athletes.  I would like to see that, too.  That'd be hilarious.  It's a great sport.  The Fertito brothers and Dana White have done a fabulous job.  We love Dana.  Yeah.  You know, just making it a great sport.  Every time I get a chance, I always go.  It's just fabulous. 
[01:54:00]  Do you got a favorite fighter or a fight you want to see?  Well, I want to see the John Bones Jones against Rashad Evans fights.  Who do you want in that one?  Well, I mean, no disrespect to John Bones, but I'm down with the old guys.  So, you know, Rashad, you know, being a fan of his, and, you know, they know each other.  So I think it's going to be a very, very interesting fight.  I'm kind of pulling for Rashad, too.  Are you?  Yeah, we had Bones, and we had all those guys.  And I always get, like, a move put on me or something.  And he choked me and this guy Bob, but he choked a little longer than he was supposed to. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, you made a great sound.  A little longer, yeah.  He just went, oh!  And, uh...  Fantastic.  He made it hurt, Shaq.  Rashad put me in a move, too.  What was the move?  He put me on a floor move, which was awful in his thighs, but he stopped immediately.  So I don't want to see Rashad pull it off.  It was a prison assault is what it was.  It looked bad, man.  How about Chael Sonnen fighting Silva in Brazil in front of 80,000 people?  Who?  Chael Sonnen is fighting...  I don't know Chael Sonnen.  He fought Silva a few years ago, and he actually, uh...  He beat him for five hours. 
[01:55:00]  Shaq just looked at Iraq, walk in in the middle of his interview.  He's looking behind the glass.  Oh, wait a minute.  That guy was in there.  That guy was over there.  Watch it now.  Doesn't that guy look like it's from one of those...  Looks like one of those, uh, A&E biker shows.  Yeah.  Shaq, why are you in here?  You just distracted our interview with Shaq.  Yeah, you just blundered in and wrecked everything.  We're having fun.  I wasn't trying to.  I was going to pull up the, uh, the video of you getting choked.  Oh, boy.  He doesn't care about that.  You don't care.  What, are we going to play videos for Shaq? 
[01:55:30]  We're talking to him.  Yeah.  Hey, Shaq, you want to see my home movies?  What are we going to do?  Bring my photo album in?  Why don't you show him your comic book collection?  Fucking get out.  Just kidding.  Hit the bricks.  Hit the bricks.  You, uh, you interested in guns?  You like shooting or?  You're law enforcement, right?  Yeah, I'm law enforcement.  That's pretty goddamn cool.  I don't want a few.  I just, you know, as a guy and as a citizen, you know, I have to be careful how I answer  this question.  Yeah, I understand.  So I, uh, I do what the law allows me to do. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Let's just put it that way.  But do you enjoy going to the range and blasting up some rounds?  Well, I mean, the only time I go for the range is when it's law enforcement purposes.  Oh, okay.  I hear you.  All right.  Yeah.  I understand.  Well, yeah.  Plus, when you're in a position where you're, again, you're one of the most recognizable guys  in the country.  Is there any, when's the last time you went somewhere where nobody in the room knew who  you are and you could just kind of relax and eat and probably can't even.  Nowhere?  Nowhere.  Like maybe when you were teenagers the last time you went up?  Jesus Christ.  That's gotta be.  When were they paying attention to you?  At what age?  15. 
[01:56:30]  15 years old.  My God.  Wow.  I guess you get used to it.  Like everything you do is going to be seen and reported on.  Right.  Does it make you text differently and email differently and communicate differently privately?  No.  You have no fear that it's going to be.  Yeah, because, uh, most of the stuff I do is not 99% for the only or so.  And every now and then person may sell a text.  I don't tell the email, but my mother, uh, my mother always calls me and tells me, uh,  her, her favorite Bible, Bible quote, no weapon formed against me.  She'll prosper. 
[01:57:00]  Hmm.  So you can sell a text and sell an email and get your 1500, but it's not.  Is that how much they go for?  I guess.  I don't know.  Jeez.  Thank God I'm not famous.  Oh, is there a lot of dirt out there on me?  Don't, don't worry about it.  Yeah.  I have no, believe me, if I ever become an athlete or become famous, there is a lot of filth.  Did you just say become an athlete?  Yeah, I was kidding.  I was just kidding.  I was, I like a little mixed martial arts.  I mean, Shaq's very tall, but I could always get in there and take him down on a single.  No way.  Oh, sure.  No way.  No, I stink.  I, I mean, not only am I short, but I've never, I do a little elliptical. 
[01:57:30]  I mean, you know, I don't want to talk a whole bunch of exercise with Shaq.  What, five minutes, ten minutes?  I'm a 30 minute elliptical guy.  I play a little, uh, iPad chess.  Shaq, you still play basketball?  No.  Not at all?  Do you shoot around or anything?  You just don't want to?  I mean, I just said, uh, I'm just getting over this, uh, Achilles injury, so.  Wow, yeah.  Still got a little hitch, so I haven't done anything.  I just, I've been, uh, working out the last couple weeks.  Charles Barkley challenged me to a shirt off competition May 15th, so. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, wow.  So, I've been.  A shirt off competition.  I've been comfortable in my skin for a long time, so I've been working out of it.  I love Barkley.  Yeah.  He keeps it real, too, man.  He does.  He's, he's great to watch.  What separates you from, because you seem almost, like, you see a lot of guys that leave  the game, but then there's guys like you and Jordan who, who seem to be kind of above  basketball ending who you are and people knowing you.  It's like you just kind of continued being Shaq in, in the public eye.  It's, you know, it's luck.  You know, I, you know, I go to a lot of corporations and they ask me my strategy and it's like, 
[01:58:30]  well, I don't really have a strategy.  You know, I've always just been myself and.  Well, sign on the line.  Yeah.  You know, I just like to, you know, throw the product out there and, you know, good thing  about products that if it's real, the people will, will take it to it.  So, I think, I think, you know, there's a lot of kids that look at me and say, you know  what, if he did it, I can do it.  Rather than, you know, coming in, faking and trying to use the big words and doing it, because  kids are the smartest beings on earth.  They know who's, who's real and they know who's making stuff up. 
[01:59:00]  And did you, because you came up in, in Newark for a few years before, I think, what you  went to, I want to say it was the South or, or Germany.  Yeah, Germany.  And was there ever a shot where you, because I know you said you were doing a little, little  real light B&Es and stuff.  Do you think that had you not moved out of that area, things might have gone totally  differently for you?  My father probably would have stopped me.  You know, he probably, probably would have did the police officer thing first.  And I don't know what, and then the army second.  Wow, yeah.  He wasn't putting up in any of that crap, right?  Right. 
[01:59:30]  He was an old school disciplinarian.  He was an old school disciplinarian.  I always tell people I live the karate kid sort of life.  Go from the projects of Newark to Germany, down South Texas to Louisiana.  And I think that's why I'm able to relate to all people.  When did you know that you had the basketball skills?  Because it's, it's, it's, it's assumed that a tall guy knows how to play basketball.  We've seen it in every high school in America, but when did you realize, oh, I got something  here?  I mean, I was always a very shy kid.  I didn't get confidence until I heard Dick Vitale say, this guy, if he decides to go 
[02:00:00]  to the NBA, he'll be the number one pick.  Wow.  Because coming out of high school, I was always ranked after New York's own Kenny Anderson.  Oh, really?  So I was always, you know, behind him all the years.  So they talked about him more than they talked about me.  So I was like, you know what, maybe I'm not that good.  But then I went to the McDonald's game and showed off and he was like, this guy's going  to be the best big man ever.  And then one day I was in college and a guy who I never really liked because I was, I was  Matty Johnson and I had a white friend named Mitch Riles who looked and acted like Larry 
[02:00:30]  Bird.  So he used to kick my ass every day.  So I didn't like Larry Bird for that reason.  But one day I'm walking to college and Larry Bird says, Shaquille O'Neal will be the best  big man ever to play the game.  Wow.  And I was like, damn, Larry Bird knows who I am.  And then all of a sudden you're like Larry Bird.  Yeah.  I was like, I love you, Larry Legend.  And Robert Parrish said, fuck you and walked out.  This is one of the most interesting things I learned about you.  You're a really good dancer.  Yes.  And I mean, you know, I cut a rug now and again, but I would never say I'm a good dancer. 
[02:01:00]  Why did you become a good dancer?  Because before I started playing basketball, I was a break dancer.  Really?  Yeah, I was a break dancer.  And basketball is all about rhythm.  So, you know, I think that's what makes me a dominant big man.  I got rhythm.  I got moves.  I got, you know, basketball is one, two or one, two, three.  Yeah, I can see where you'd be a good dancer.  Dancing is one, two, one, two, three.  I can see that would help your game, Jimmy.  I, but I, no, this was like, the interesting thing was at a young age, because you always 
[02:01:30]  think that a big guy or a strong guy has everything.  And, and you obviously, like you said, you had people pick on you or fuck with you.  So you had to develop these things to, so that you said to distract from them seeing that  about you, you learned.  I had to do what all the little guys was doing.  The guys was break dancing and flipping and they was running fast and, you know, they  was climbing up walls and doing parkour before it was called parkour.  So I did everything they did.  I couldn't even pop lock.  You know, I try, we all try when breaking came out.  I think I'm a couple years older.  Just not my thing.  Any embarrassing pictures of you in a neon suit and big puffy hat break dancing? 
[02:02:00]  No.  No, huh?  That video would sell.  Oh, man.  A young check break dancing?  Bringing out the piece of cardboard in the boombox.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So I say you also, you stuttered when you were younger.  Was that like, was that a constant thing?  And how did you overcome that?  I overcame it.  I met this speech therapist one day.  She said, just, just be cool when you talk.  Just be cool.  But what happened? 
[02:02:30]  Would you get scared?  No, just like, like try to talk fast or get nervous.  And then they would stutter.  But now I know how to be cool with it.  I know how to, like, fake a smile or say, um, and, you know, just, you know, move on  to something else.  Oh.  Hey.  I love this show.  I guess it helps if you can laugh at yourself, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I always laugh at myself.  Did that come from getting teased growing up and you had to learn to fire back when you  were a dead man?  No, just, you know, like to laugh.  You know, I think people that take themselves a little too seriously need to turn up their 
[02:03:00]  sense of humor levels.  I love to laugh.  I mean, I grew up watching Good Times, Sanford and Son, Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley.  I love to laugh.  Red Foxx, I just read his book, you know, hilarious guy, but not a good business.  It's another, there's an example of a guy who constantly made odd business decisions.  He's like, did nobody love you enough to tell you not to invest in a fucking car fur on  the outside of the car?  He did.  It looked cool.  It was, it was, it was, whatever it's called.  It looked cool, though.  But put fur on the outside of your car and he didn't consider the fact that it would 
[02:03:30]  rain.  And he lost a million dollars doing that.  He wanted to make it a business instead of just for his own car?  Hilarious.  He was just one of those guys.  He was a good guy.  He gave out a lot of money.  He was a generous dude.  And he just, Sanford and Son was an amazing show.  He needed a guy like, like you in his life.  Who's your favorite comic if you had to pick one?  It's a lot.  You know, in this world we live in, we don't have to just go with one anymore.  So there's just a lot.  I mean, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock and Chris Tucker and Cat Williams and now Kevin Hart.  And we got a new one that we're, that we're working on, Gary Owens, who's, who's a white 
[02:04:00]  guy.  Yeah.  He's from Peter.  Yeah.  He's so, you know, it's a lot of comedians, but the good thing about comedy is like there's  different type of comedies.  Like I love the guy who does the redneck jokes.  Jeff Foxworthy.  Oh, you love Foxworthy.  Oh my God.  It's funny.  I like him and, you know, I like their style of comedy and it's just, I just love laughing.  If you weren't a ball player or if you weren't an athlete, would you want to be an actor or  a professional dancer or a comic?  Like what would you? 
[02:04:30]  I would love to be an actor, one of the action star, one of those big, big, strong, you know,  guys on TV who really didn't have to act.  Just say.  Like Carl Weathers.  Yeah.  Carl Weathers.  And they'll just say, you know, the one crazy line that's going to make me a lot of money.  I'll be back.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  He gets an award.  Yeah.  It's like one of those lines that kind of sinks in.  Like for Eastwood, it was go ahead, make my day for a Schwarzenegger.  There's always that one.  Hasta la vista.  Yeah.  Arnold had quite a few.  There's nothing worse than somebody trying to have one of those lines and it fails miserably. 
[02:05:00]  You know, call me in an hour.  You're like, oh, fail.  Fail.  Fail.  Fail.  Terrible.  You say you have a sense of humor about yourself.  Have you seen some of the parodies people have done of you?  Of course.  I remember one from, I think it was Mad TV.  Yeah.  And they were doing your Icy Hot commercial, doing a parody of it.  I love it.  It was hilarious, man.  And I actually, you know, sometimes when I see comedians, I say, hey, talk about me.  Oh, yeah?  I love it.  Yeah.  I love it.  I don't get mad.  I like to laugh. 
[02:05:30]  You know who told me to talk about them?  I met, I was hosting the Porn Awards in 2004 and Mike Tyson was on the expo floor.  So we got introduced very, very briefly and he kept telling me, he's like, go up, tell  everybody I'm a pimp.  Tell everybody I'm a pimp.  Talk about me tomorrow.  And I'm like, all right, Mike.  Of course I didn't because.  Why wouldn't you?  Because he didn't show up.  Yeah, I'm not going to listen to Tyson.  Oh, yeah.  You kind of yes somebody to death when they're fucking.  Have you met?  He's a menacing guy.  Even though he's a nice guy.  Tyson, there's nothing scarier than a championship heavyweight fighter.  I've met Tyson and he's a great guy. 
[02:06:00]  I actually went to visit him when he was incarcerated.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I went to visit him.  You know, he's always been very, very hospitable to me.  You know, a great guy.  Yeah, he was pleasant both times I met him.  Nice guy.  There's this air though.  You kind of feel with a guy like Tyson, like there's not that professional amateur boundary  if I do something stupid.  He's going to react to me like a man, not a detached.  What are you going to be?  Well, exactly.  A victim.  What am I going to be?  The fucking plaintiff.  He's going to knock. 
[02:06:30]  I said, he's going to knock you the fuck out.  We all know that.  There's a few guys you just know.  Exactly.  That's hilarious.  Chuck Liddell would do that.  Chuck Liddell would, you know.  I'd be more scared of John Jones than fucking Chuck for some reason because he's a younger  guy, man.  Chuck's a brawler.  John could throw some blows too, but Chuck's one of those guys at the bar.  Yeah, Chuck looks like he's a bar problem.  No, we're talking about the guys that would just snap.  Liddell would snap it in an instant.  Liddell would lay up like a beer stein upside your head and then just pound you. 
[02:07:00]  He alpha males you when he talks to you, but he doesn't mean to like he's a really nice  dude, but he kind of just like leans in with his big barrel chest and his fucking face  is right by your ear.  And you're like, people think he's menacing me, but he's like, I really enjoyed you.  And you're like, well, thanks.  Don't forget about how he breathes like a bull too.  Yeah, because his nose is broken a couple of times.  He came to the improv one night with Dana.  I was in L.A. and he's fucking heckling me.  I'm being heckled by Liddell.  What do you do?  I laughed it off like a girl.  I tee-heed him.  Well, you should.  Speaking of fighting, I just want to tell Shaq, I'm so glad I didn't knock on your door. 
[02:07:30]  We were on vacation at the same time.  You have no idea.  Trust me.  I know that.  But you were down in Turks and Caicos.  This was about four or five years ago.  And me and my now wife were in a room and someone was making a lot of fucking noise upstairs.  And I'm like, I'm going to go up there and say something.  Turned out, to make a long story short, it was you upstairs.  Was it me or the kids?  You had everybody.  Oh, yeah.  You had a lot of people down there.  They pretty much had the...  Sorry. 
[02:08:00]  No, but I'm thinking, you know, I'm going to be a man and do the right thing.  You were in Turks.  What were you trying to do, sleep?  Well, it was later at night, man.  Like, go out.  And then I learned through the week that, yeah, Shaq's staying right upstairs.  And then you would, you know, I don't know if you want to hear this, but this guy was  beyond cool to every freaking person that came up to him that week.  Beyond cool.  Yeah, is that frustrating, too?  Like, is there ever a place where people bother you?  Where you're like, look, I know you're a fan, but right now, come on.  No, not really.  I just try to be, like, you know, polite. 
[02:08:30]  Like, you know, the other day I was at a Fogo the Chow.  You know, the place where they bring the meat on, so I'm eating.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Is that Korean barbecue?  No.  It's like for Brazilian, right?  Yeah.  So I was eating.  With the paddle?  With the red?  Oh, man.  You don't go red ever, do you?  No, I go green.  Oh, you go green the entire time.  They will bring you all sorts of meat until you finally put that paddle to red.  Until you ask for the ham.  They get very pissy if you ask for the ham.  You have to.  They never just bring the ham out.  Why would you go for the ham?  The fucking ham is phenomenal.  It's lovely.  They got so much good stuff.  Yes.  So I was eating and the lady was like, in like mid-light, can you take a picture? 
[02:09:00]  I was like, not right now, man.  I'm eating.  Yeah.  But other than that, like, I'll either say yes or I'll try to give you a polite no.  I never understood.  Like, that's like the hackiest thing a fan can do is come up to somebody while they're eating.  It's like everyone knows that's not the time to do it.  I was like, you want me to drop the sausage?  Take a picture?  I'll drop the sausage.  I don't think so, lady.  Yeah, I'll ask anybody, but never while they're eating.  It's like, wait outside. 
[02:09:30]  If you want, like, make yourself inconvenient.  Stand there, wait, and then try to get somebody.  Jimmy's the pro at that.  Last time I went there, I went with my cousins and a couple uncles, and we all had shit stories  the next day.  Well, you're packing so much meat.  Oh, well.  You're amazed what your body can do the next day.  How do you know I was packing so much meat?  When you're next to me in the bathroom stall, that's my nickname.  Pack a lot of meat.  Pack a lot of meat.  One of my cousins couldn't wait to call me and tell me he shit the whole way back home 
[02:10:00]  on the Long Island Railroad.  We were eating so much meat.  You can't eat there every week.  It's a pleasant story.  But it is.  You know, a bunch of guys related.  There's one on 46th Street called Plataforma, which is really good.  I think that's the one I went to.  It's fucking fantastic.  We ate at them in Rio.  You ever been to Rio?  Yes.  They have, I mean, you know, in between, you know, brothel breaks.  You have to have food.  And I would run to the original.  It's a brothel break, so can you define that?  Well, I would take a hundred milligram Viagra and, you know, run into a place and just really. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, brothel.  Yeah, brothel.  Okay.  Yeah, I really misbehaved.  With a bunch of comedians.  Yeah, a bunch of us went.  And they would just laugh at each other in their bathrobes.  It was fun.  With their hard-ons.  Yeah, it was just a brothel.  Is that the place you can get the regular massage or the home run massage?  Oh, they didn't play.  No, there was not even the hint of massage.  It was like, I like you.  Because there was no language connection.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's weird how you make out with girls in that situation. 
[02:11:00]  Like, I was kissing prostitutes.  Jesus.  I don't say that, you know, proudly, but I just, I did.  I don't know why I'm talking about this.  So, Dove products are all right.  When you're done, you really want to scrub up and then smell good afterwards.  And I suggest Dove, that body wash that Shaq is promoting.  Be comfortable in your own skin.  Right.  Is that kind of the theme of it?  Yes.  That's a slug line.  Because it actually does smell.  It's weird.  I like it.  I really do. 
[02:11:30]  No, it's nice.  It's really nice.  And what do they have?  They have, because we only got the deodorant.  And I think, like, the face and body wash.  Do they have other stuff?  They got shampoo?  Yeah, they got all that stuff.  And creams and stuff like that?  I'm going to go with shampoo now.  Head to toe.  They got everything.  What do you do when you get a product pitched to you?  Do you say, all right, let me try this for a week and see if I like it?  Well, if I've never tried it before, I'll just be like, nah, probably not.  Like, for example, after my first championship, Wheaties contacted me.  But I told my manager, who was my uncle, Uncle Mike, I was like, I'm, you know, growing up in Newark, we couldn't afford Wheaties. 
[02:12:00]  But if you call Frosted Flakes or Fruit Wheaties, tell them I want to be on the cover.  So he contacted them.  They weren't really doing it.  So he called them, but I was like, well, no, we've never really done it before.  But why wouldn't they do that?  So the second year, he was like, hey, Wheaties want you again.  I'm like, nah, man.  Right.  Frosted Flakes.  I even added ones like Rice Krispies or Fruit Loops.  So the third year, I was like, you know what?  Forget all those people. 
[02:12:30]  Just call Corn Flakes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So then after the one in Miami, D-Wade had a deal with Wheaties.  So they put me and him on the cover.  Isn't that weird?  Like, what bad marketing by the company to not have you on the cover eating Wheaties?  Or I'm sorry, or whatever.  Frosted Flakes.  That's just dumb on their part.  What if Fruit Loops gets Shaq on their cereal boxes?  Probably some would be talking about that.  Probably some dumb marketing exec.  Well, technically, it could be a fan of their Spurs who might not buy it, not realizing that 
[02:13:00]  that's just great advertising.  I remember my parents telling me, because I love Frosted Flakes, and it's like, oh, I want  Frosted Flakes.  And they're like, we'll get Corn Flakes.  You put a little sugar on it.  It's the same thing.  It's like, no, but it's not the same thing.  It's not, but like when you're growing up, like how we grew up.  Oh, it'll do.  Believe me.  Yeah, yeah.  I got one.  Frosted Flakes, man.  This is the best.  I got one more basketball question.  You think LeBron James is going to get it done?  Ever?  One day, yeah.  I think it will.  One day.  You think he'll get it done in Miami with Dwayne and Bosh?  Uh, it's set up that way.  It's set up that way. 
[02:13:30]  Well, obviously.  But now all the other teams are catching up, and they're getting their superstar team  together.  It took Mike how many years to get it?  I want to say, uh, six.  Did it take him six years?  Oh, yeah.  Did he not get it until after Pippen was there, or was Pippen always there?  No, I'm not sure.  It took him six.  He won eight.  Eight years.  It took me eight.  It took you eight?  It took me eight.  Wow.  I couldn't believe you played 19 years.  I read, I was like, because I remember when your career started, it's like, Jesus Christ,  that was a 20-year run.  So, I mean, hopefully, hopefully he will get it. 
[02:14:00]  But, you know, the unfortunate thing, the greater you are, one is not enough.  Like, I can remember busting my ass to get one, and then, like, they let me celebrate  on the ESPN one day, and then, could the Lakers become a dynasty?  Yeah.  Did they get two?  It's like, now you gotta.  Yeah, so then you gotta get two.  Oh, again, they get three.  And then after we lost the third, the Lakers are terrible.  Trade Shaq.  Shaq's too old.  And then when I got one of them.  You ever get frustrated by the media?  Yeah.  Does some of that stuff feed away at you, ever? 
[02:14:30]  I only get frustrated when the ones that don't have G14 classification speak.  But I used it to drive me, and I used it to, you know, motivate me.  What is G14 classification?  I mean, again, for the listeners.  I mean, we know.  I mean, like, you know, for me, like, if you never played, then I don't know how you  could speak on certain situations.  That's all.  I mean, like, you know, everyone has an opinion.  I respect opinion, but don't tell me how to be a big man when you're not a big man.  Like, you would listen to Barkley saying it, obviously. 
[02:15:00]  No, not even Barkley.  Oh, really?  Oh, because he never won a championship.  No, not only that, but because I'm more classified than he is.  Nice.  I like that.  So, like, you know, like, for example, Bill Walton only has 6,000 points.  Like, he would say certain things, and I'd be like, how do you know, Bill, I got 20,000  points already?  You know what I'm saying?  So, you know, my thing with Bill is, like, you know, we're both in the federal building,  but you're on the law floor, and I'm up. 
[02:15:30]  You know, it's only, you know, two guys that have more clearance than me, and that's Kareem  and Wood Chamberlain.  Who else would you put in the top five centers of all time?  Obviously, Shaq, Wilt, Kareem.  I don't put myself in the top five.  You're being humble.  We would.  No, I never did.  But you got to go with Bill, Kareem, and Wilt, those three.  And then I'm going to put either Akeem or Patrick Ewing in front of me.  We're getting completely... 
[02:16:00]  They're telling us we have to wrap up Shaq.  Shaq's busy guy.  He is under press, but let's just give a good plug.  I'm going to stay here.  Oh, that's nice.  Thank you.  Look at these guys.  Especially this weird-looking guy in the back.  Sam?  Yes.  The big eyebrows.  I know.  Don't they look like a Muppet?  Yeah.  We're not sure if his race or gender.  He's just kind of creepy.  He looks whanish.  What is that?  White and Spanish?  Yeah.  Oh, whanish.  Yeah, whanish.  Maybe you're Spanish.  We're trying to figure it out.  And the camera girl's hot.  Hey, sexy camera girl.  Hey, you still with Hoops? 
[02:16:30]  Yes.  Love the Hoops.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Hoops is sexy.  Sorry.  I mean, I hope this is going to happen.  Watch your mouth, man.  What the hell is going on?  Love the Hoops.  I got to get out of this show.  I love the Hoops.  The product is Dove products, the Dove line.  Be comfortable in your skin.  And honestly, it's easy just to say it, but they really are good.  And I've been using them for the last, I guess, five days since we had them.  And they smell great.  And they really are good.  I'm psychic.  She's from Detroit. 
[02:17:00]  You?  Oh, wow.  All right.  I didn't even notice that.  That's great.  You are observant.  She's been in here 50 times, and I've never noticed that.  Detroit tat.  I just look at a woman's eyes.  I know how to read, people.  So thanks, Shaquille.  Yeah, absolutely.  I might ask you to take a photo, but again, just for the website, you know.  All right.  I normally wouldn't.  Of course.  Thanks, man.  See you guys.  All right.  Yeah, please come back and see us.  Shaq, everyone.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. 
[02:17:30]  Anthony Show.  What's up?  Y-Rock just yelled in my ear.  I might have lost my eardrum.  What did he say?  Holy fuck.  Is your volume up loud today, Y-Rock?  Sorry.  It must be.  This is Shaq's.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, you didn't play this before.  We didn't have time before.  Wait until he was out of here.  Played it when he was coming in.  Shaq was.  And we'd have been, like, all embarrassed.  Shaq was beyond cool.  What a great guy.  Beyond cool. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Didn't mind what we asked.  Soft spoken.  You know when these guys are cool when they hang out after the interview's over for a few  minutes.  And talk for a few minutes.  Yes.  And talk for, you know, a few more minutes.  Not just run out of the place.  Right.  Run out of the journey.  Aziz.  Aziz, I'm sorry, man.  To the O.P.  Anthony Show.  How are you, sir?  Finally.  Yeah, it's been a while.  But you're on the road all the time, anyway.  I was telling them outside the studio how much we like Observe and Rapport.  It's one of my favorite comedies of all time.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I know you've done a lot. 
[02:18:30]  But, man, that movie fucking rocked.  That was a fun one.  I'm sorry.  Go, man.  Go.  We surprised it didn't make more.  I was like, because Mall Cop makes $100 million.  I thought Observe and Rapport was much funnier.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I guess that other one came up first and, like, it's a little bit darker  and everything, so.  The darker one is a little bit harder.  Yeah.  Harder sell for people, I guess.  I don't know.  I liked it like that, though.  Yeah.  I mean, that's my preference.  I hated Mall Cop.  I couldn't even get through the whole thing.  I never saw it.  I don't know if you want to trash the movie.  That's up to you.  But I'll tell you right now, 45 minutes in, I'm like, I can't do this anymore. 
[02:19:00]  I didn't laugh once in 45 minutes.  And it made all that fucking money.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I just thought Observe and Rapport, we talk about it all the time, it was just so fucking  harsh.  It was like, that's what I would have done with a skateboard, smash it off somebody's head  or, like, in a comedy.  I love that.  That's what you'd want to do.  And you and Seth just had a scene where you were just saying, fuck you to each other.  Yeah, that was Jody who just pitched that on the spot.  He was like, the director, he was like, oh, just keep going back.  And then the last one, it's like, really just whisper it. 
[02:19:30]  It's funny.  Did you get a picture with Shaquille?  No.  You know, it's so weird.  Like, you know, I wanted to go and be like, hey, good to meet you or whatever.  And then I was just scared.  I was like, oh, I don't want to bother him.  But it's not like he's going to be like, shut up, and like slap me down on the ground.  Like, people are nice people.  You know, there's no reason for, like, you know, to be so scared.  And it's not eating.  Are you shy about that?  Because there was one night at the cellar where the word was LeBron James.  Who else was coming that night?  A bunch of the Miami Heat guys were in town, and they wanted to come to the cellar, and they came down, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  They came to see Aziz, though.  They weren't coming just to the cellar.  Oh, really?  They knew Aziz was there, and LeBron and those guys were coming to see him specifically.  And it's like, you didn't even take a picture afterwards.  No, I feel worried about taking pictures.  You have an opposite policy.  He is.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy loves a good picture.  He was kind of practicing his Shaq picture today to make sure it was going to work.  I had to, because I have an Abdul-Jabbar.  I want to fucking book him.  Yeah.  And E-Rock has become the go-to guy for Jimmy's pictures, because Jimmy will try everyone out. 
[02:20:30]  I used to take the pictures for Jimmy.  I think I failed somewhere along the line.  Quite a responsibility, E-Rock.  Because I've never asked anymore.  It's your one shot.  If it's blurry or something, it's a big fail.  Yeah, it really is.  Roland was your guy for a while, but now I see E-Rock's your picture.  E-Rock has a better camera.  My camera fucking really irritates me.  Really?  Yeah.  But I was impressed that you didn't do that.  I was like, I wish I was like that, because it takes so much pressure off to it.  You can just enjoy a situation.  Yeah.  Are you nervous when guys like that watch you?  Like, as Kanye West has come down to see Aziz, you have a lot of famous friends. 
[02:21:00]  Does that make you, when there's a guy like that in the audience, do you really think differently,  or do you just honestly not give a shit?  Um, I don't know.  I guess, you know, you want to do well, because they've come to see you.  I mean, it's just like any friend coming to see you, you want to give them a good show.  And you don't want to, like, do bad and be like, oh, this guy's awful.  He's wasting his time all the time doing this.  He does this every night, and he's awful.  And then they have to give you the polite, what's worse than when you bomb in front of  a friend, they're like, you know, hey, no, it was good, it was good.  They should just come up and go, you ate your balls. 
[02:21:30]  And then you're just like, oh, well, you know, that crowd was weird or whatever.  They're like, yeah, definitely a weird crowd.  You're horrible.  It's really uncomfortable, because you know they're trying to make you feel better, and  you're like, just let's acknowledge what happened.  That really stunk.  But you work, though.  You know, it's like you come down, you see Aziz, and there's fucking, he's got his headphones  on in between shows.  You're writing things down.  It's like you don't take for granted the fact that you're doing well, which I like a lot.  Well, I mean, you know, I just remember starting out doing comedy, like, it's so hard to even 
[02:22:00]  get spots.  Like, you're like, oh, I got this many spots, and you really appreciate them.  And now, like, after you do a bunch of stuff, you can get spots all the time.  It's like, I feel like you owe it to, like, all those people that would give anything for  that spot to just really, you know, give 100% and really try to, like, get better and do  something with it, not just, like, you know.  No, just coast.  Come on.  That's it.  You know, you're right.  You've done enough.  What do you want to do? 
[02:22:30]  Like, because right now you got this, Aziz is promoting Dangerously Delicious.  It's available for $5 on azizandsari.com, and it's A-Z-I-Z-A-N-S-A-R-I.com.  Right.  Kind of in the Louis C.K. model, which is so fucking smart.  That's what everyone's calling it, the Louis C.K. model.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, I wanted to put it out online.  I filmed the special, like, in June of last year, and I paid for it myself because I wanted 
[02:23:00]  to put it out online because I saw, like, how many people would watch, like, clips of  my last special on YouTube versus, like, DVD sales.  And I was like, all right, well, clearly way more people are watching this stuff online.  So, you know, I feel like corporations and stuff, their thing is like, oh, how do we stop  people from watching it on YouTube?  And my kind of thought was like, well, if that's what people want to do, like, how do I, like,  embrace this?  And so I was talking to all these different people about trying to figure out, like, a  way to do kind of a unique digital release.  And then Louis was, like, editing his special, and I was just hanging out at his place, like, 
[02:23:30]  watching the special with him.  And he told me what he was doing.  And I was like, oh, that's interesting.  I wonder if that'll work.  Because I wasn't sure if enough people would find out about it, you know, without a network  behind it and everything.  And it was, like, a huge success, obviously.  And immediately people were like, oh, will you do the same thing?  Could you do the same thing?  And, like, people just seemed to really like it, you know?  As soon as I put mine out there, everyone was like, oh, I'm so glad you did this.  I hope more and more comics do this.  Because, I don't know, it just seems like people really respect that way of putting it 
[02:24:00]  out.  It's great.  It's fucking really smart, dude.  Because they've been ripping off, you know, the artists for a long time.  Getting one over on, you know, the record companies, it's going to the artists instead  of to, you know, 20 levels of fucking management.  Fuck the middle man.  Yeah.  And the idea of buying some hard copy of something these days just doesn't appeal to a lot of  people.  Yeah.  Fucking DVDs and CDs and shit like that.  I'd rather have it instantly.  I'd rather be able to get it in my house, not have to go out for it. 
[02:24:30]  And I don't want to have to stack it up on a shelf somewhere, you know?  Yeah.  Well, it's the guys that can do it.  Like, Louis is a great guy to do it first.  Aziz, Gaffigan.  These are all guys with a huge web presence.  You know, Aziz, what, 1.8 or 1.7 million Twitter?  It's like, you got to have that to start to kind of get this trend going.  Because I have a fan base, but not like that.  Like, I can't.  If I released it right now, they'd be like, epic fail.  Oh, jeez.  Because I would sell a few copies, but I wouldn't even make my money back at this point.  So the more guys that do it, the bigger that becomes, and then it's fucking better for  all of a sudden.  It becomes the thing to do. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, I'm really happy that guys are doing this.  Did you just say 1.8 million Twitter followers?  It's halfway to me.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  1.8 or 1.7.  Holy fuck.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  How did that happen?  We plug like whores, and we're all in.  We don't know.  I don't even want to tell you.  Oh, my God.  The difference.  I could be off.  I could be off on Aziz's followers.  The difference between my entire follower list is 1.8 or 1.7.  Right.  But, again, these are the guys that should be doing stuff like that.  You're a good one to follow, by the way. 
[02:25:30]  They're fun.  Oh, thanks.  Some guys are a bore out there, and they're funny people, though.  It's like, how about you do a little funny on the Twitter first?  Do you worry at the point right now saying something that's going to get in trouble because  you have a TV gig?  No.  You hear what he said about Geraldo?  No.  Absolutely.  The funniest thing in the world to me is, like, I forget sometimes that news outlets,  whenever big news happens, they read people's Twitters, and they, like, quote it like it's  a quote from an interview, and it's like, hey, man, I wouldn't say that to you. 
[02:26:00]  I'd just say that because I'm being a goofball on Twitter.  But the Geraldo thing happened, and I tweeted something like, I said, it's appropriate to  say this on any day, but today especially, fuck you, Geraldo.  And I just wrote that on Twitter, and then I have to read this, like, it was like, it  was some respectable news outlet.  It was like the Hollywood Reporter or something.  Oh, brother.  And this is, and it, there is a difference between what you tweet and what you would say 
[02:26:30]  to somebody if that's a quote.  Yes, if you ask.  Not anymore, man.  But in this case, normally I'm, like, really not supportive of that, but in this case,  I'm, I actually am glad they did it because it's so funny to me, but in the headline  it says, Geraldo Rivera says Trayvon Martin's hoodie made him a target, receives major  backlash.  The Fox News commentator says Martin's killer should be prosecuted, but that the victim's  attire put him at fault, too.  Aziz Ansari responds, fuck you, Geraldo.  That is a great quote.  That's just like, this will be funny to do this. 
[02:27:00]  That's a good quote, man.  But, but it also sounds like, oh, that's your take on it?  Just fuck you, Geraldo?  Fuck you.  Real intelligent analysis of the situation, Aziz.  But the way that's written, it's almost like Putin said something and Obama responds.  Fuck you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like you're both news, one guy's a journalist, one guy's a stand-up comic, and  it's just funny the way.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  It does knock down all the barriers, though.  It seems like guys in different professions or bloggers now have almost as much juice  as actual news people, comedians as much as journalists. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, well, that's another thing, too, though.  It's like someone puts up like a Tumblr or something, and then you see news articles  like quoting it as a source.  It's like, that's not a source.  Right.  That's just, just because somebody bought a website doesn't mean like what they've  written on there has any, like, truth or anything.  I love when people like cut and paste something from somewhere, and they're like, oh, check  this out.  And I'll read it and be like, ah, so I'll cut and paste it and put it in Google and see  where it came from.  And you realize it's completely without any basis, without any facts, no checking up on 
[02:28:00]  anything.  And it's just some guy's blog.  It's like, oh, really?  Is this fucking, you know, I don't think he's winning the Edward R. Murrow Award for reporting.  I've done horrible.  I've done so many interviews with, like, some, you know, places that are respectable, and  they're like, they've clearly done their research on Wikipedia, and it's like, you know  that's not a real thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you go to, or you go to Snopes.com a lot of times and see if something's bullshit.  And it's like, oh, yeah, this is a story that originated back in 1986 with this, that, 
[02:28:30]  and people be like, dude, check this shit out.  Like, really?  You're buying this?  And then you realize that's what most people are doing, going, oh, wow, that's true.  No, it's not.  It's research.  Or they interview you, and they ask you, like, from the Wikipedia, something that's such an  unimportant.  I had one line in Spider-Man.  It was fun for us, but nobody gives a shit.  It's one line in 2001.  And I'll go on the radio sometimes, like, in another market, they'll go, so you were  in Spider-Man?  And I'm like, I didn't fucking co-star in it.  I was like a quarter step above an extra. 
[02:29:00]  Like, where do you want me to go with this discussion?  A funny story behind that.  Traffic on the fucking Queensborough Bridge and all.  You were the surly truck driver.  Come on, Jimmy.  But when they do their research on Wikipedia, they don't understand how insignificant some  things are.  And the person that wrote it has, you know, they just picked the random things they wanted  to mention, you know?  We're probably guilty of that, too.  Of course we are.  It's all we do.  Well, the thing is, it is convenient.  Yeah.  I don't know what we got on you on the sheets. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, let's see what bullshit we have.  Okay, but he did say fuck you.  We'll let you see your one sheet.  Okay.  He did say fuck you.  Oh, and you have that Hollywood report, yeah.  Yes, we did that.  Oh, we got that.  Done, done.  And getting ready to start touring his next special, Buried Alive, next month, true or  false?  That is true.  Oh, good.  One thing, man, just to be clear, the new tour, it's all new material.  So many people ask me, like, is it the same material?  It's like, wouldn't that be horrible to, like, put out a special and then say the exact  same stuff?  The same shit you did last time. 
[02:30:00]  The exact same hour.  Like, oh, I don't want to watch a special because I'm going to live shows.  It's like, no, I'm going to do different stuff.  Don't worry.  You try to do a new hour every year?  Yeah, you know, I film the Parks and Recreation show and we shoot three weeks and then we  have a week off.  And when we have a week off, I usually come back to New York and try to do a lot of stand-up  and work on stuff and try to work on it in L.A. too.  But yeah, you know, I've been writing stuff for a few months and I got out to a new hour  and I'm ready to tour it.  And Parks and Recreation is a great show, by the way.  Oh, thank you very much.  Really critically acclaimed.  Yes, yes. 
[02:30:30]  Very fun.  You should relax a little bit, though.  Jeez, working.  He's blowing up right in front of everyone's eyes.  God.  And he does work, though.  It's like when you see a guy with headphones on or just obviously caring about the set  and the material and not bullshitting around and not just, hey, I got an hour and fucking  it.  It's like you like to see that.  Aziz, what was your big break?  Because I feel like you just came out of nowhere all of a sudden and then everyone just  knew you.  But what was the big break that really put you over the top, you think?  I guess it was kind of a slow build.  I was doing stand-up and then I started winning some little things like Aspen and things like 
[02:31:00]  that and then I was making these short films with some friends and then that got us a show  on MTV we did called Human Giant.  It was a sketch comedy show.  And then that kind of became a calling card for different acting stuff, those little small  roles in different movies and then Parks and Recreation and then that kind of led to  other stuff.  So I guess those were kind of the big steps.  And then the whole time I've been doing stand-up and I put out a stand-up special in 2010,  January 2010 was the first special I put out.  Yeah, but the costume through all of it has always been that. 
[02:31:30]  I know that.  Overnight, 11 years.  Have you been out of 11 years?  I'll hit 11 years like in May of this year, I guess.  Wow.  First time I saw Aziz, I think Manny from the comedy show loved him.  I mean, you know, of course we would tease Manny because we thought he was trying to sexually  abuse him.  He was trying to treat each other.  That was such a weird thing.  Like, I did stand-up like my third time ever and it was like one of these new talent  nights at the Comedy Cellar and it was just like one of those things where the crowd was  just like super into me, like the material was horrible or whatever, but like for some 
[02:32:00]  reason I just like really killed just on just, you know, just being like comfortable on stage  and natural and whatever.  And Manny, who was the, you know, manager owner of the Comedy Cellar, who was like, which  is like, you know, the hardest club to get past that in New York was like, you should  do the main show.  And I was like, all right, sure.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  But I was, I had been doing it for like not long at all.  So, you know, it's just like, it was this weird thing where I was like, well, of course 
[02:32:30]  I'm going to, I have to like take advantage and try to do it.  But it's like, I wasn't ready at all.  But he was really super nice to me.  Yeah, Manny loved him.  And Manny, Manny was a hard one because he knew, he knew everybody.  And I think Manny's probably the funniest guy I've ever known.  Like for real.  Wow.  Really?  He was funnier than any of the comics.  He would literally could hold court at the table with a bunch of dumb comics.  And I mean, you know, Patrice, myself, DiPaolo, Colin, and we would all just sit there and  laugh.  He could dominate any conversation.  So he had like, when Manny liked something, you had a lot of respect for the fact that he 
[02:33:00]  liked it because he wasn't some fucking idiot.  He was a funny dude.  Yeah.  Of course, we had to tease him with, you know, Manny molesting jokes because that's what  we do to each other.  You can't just be nice to your friends and go, oh, that's nice.  You found someone you like.  So look, according to the list here, you do play Tom Haverford on Parks and Recreation.  Yes.  That's true.  That's my character.  Oh, let me correct it.  It's Packers.  P-A-K-R-S.  Who the fuck wrote this?  Dump.  Oh.  Whoops.  Whoops.  Sam Roberts.  Have you been in 30 minutes or less?  Get him to the Greek funny people and observe and report. 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  All those films.  Accurate information.  This is the worst one sheet ever.  Not that it's bad information, but it's awesome.  I like it.  It's none of it tells you anything about Aziz.  I know.  We like a little bit of the in-depth stuff.  Aziz was raised here or this.  Something.  Oh, this is good.  Have you hung out with Jay-Z and Kanye West?  And are you in the video for Otis?  Yes, I am in that video.  What are we, Entertainment Tonight?  What the hell is that?  Oh, God. 
[02:34:00]  Well, what are we supposed to ask?  But these are not even good bullet points.  I like it.  It's great.  Good show prep.  What made you want to do stand-up?  I'll always ask other comics that.  Not my job.  What made me want to do stand-up?  I was in college and it was just, you know, I would tell stories and things like that to  just friends hanging out and, you know, a couple of times people were like, oh, you should  try to do stand-up, maybe a new talent night.  And I did, the first one I did was one of those new talent nights at the Comedy Cellar. 
[02:34:30]  And I really enjoyed it.  And I just, it was just something I was like, oh, I want to get really good at this.  And that was always kind of the thing.  It wasn't like, I want to be an actor.  I want to, you know, do a sitcom or anything like that.  It was, it was just like, oh, I really enjoy stand-up and I want to try to get better at this.  And then I've just been doing it ever since then.  You had scared shit when you went up there first time?  Uh, yeah, I was, but you know, a lot of my friends had heard I was doing it, so a lot  of them came out, so it was kind of like I had a little bit of a, you know, safety net.  They're all assholes, though, friends. 
[02:35:00]  Friends stink.  They're the first ones to go, boo, you suck.  I'm sure there was people that came and were like, oh, God, what a, it was horrible.  Can you believe this guy?  He's going out every night to do this.  Have you ever had a chick come see you and then you have a bad set in front of a girl?  That's the fucking worst.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Is that bad?  Yeah.  It's no good.  That's horrible.  Do they just completely turn off to you?  It's like, oh, well. 
[02:35:30]  No.  I mean, it's definitely not a turn on.  Yeah.  It would be a lot better to kill and, yeah.  I've been doing this 10, 11 years and I'm bad at it.  And I suck.  Walk me through this, though.  You find a lady you like and then you invite her down to see your comedy?  Yeah.  And then you bomb horribly?  Let's say you're doing a spot at the cellar.  The way it works is you go on stage and there's that little area where we call the jumper  seats.  There's three seats where the comedians will put their guests off to the side and your  guests will sit there.  And then you're on and you hear some people talking and you're about 30 seconds into it 
[02:36:00]  and a couple of jokes get nothing.  And then you hear like, ah.  And you're like, uh-oh.  She's right there.  And you start bombing and you're like, she's fucking watching me bomb.  And it's humiliating.  Oh, no.  And you keep looking for Artie Fuqua or William Stevenson to come in and give you the light.  Like, get the fuck off.  Oh, get the fuck off.  Because you're just killing the crowd.  And then you start pulling out your A's shit and that starts bombing because the crowd  already hates you.  That's the worst.  We're like, well, let me pull out the big guns.  They're like, oh, no, the big guns are failing, too. 
[02:36:30]  Punch out.  Punch out.  You're going in.  It's the worst when you feel you have ammunition and then your ammunition fucking just falls  flat.  Oh, wow.  I was doing a set like a couple of nights ago.  There's one friend I brought to a couple of times.  He's a musician.  And I really respect his music.  And, you know, I brought him like a couple of months ago and it didn't go well.  And then I was like, all right, I'll bring him again.  You know, I've been doing this new stuff.  It's going really well.  And then it's just going bad.  And I was like, fuck, this guy's just bad luck or something.  And I was just like, it was annoying because, you know, you do these shows and I don't 
[02:37:00]  think people realize like, oh, I've said this stuff before.  I've said a version of a lot of this stuff before and it's killed.  That's what I'm saying again.  I have recordings of it.  And I always thought it would be amazing to be like, you know what?  I'm just going to play you another audience.  I'm going to play you 10 other audiences laughing hysterically at what I just said to prove  that you're wrong.  You're an outlier.  You're in the minority.  Your opinion is of the minority.  That always amazed me, like when you guys talk about that, like, oh, yeah, fucking 
[02:37:30]  bombed last night.  And you're doing the same stuff that killed the night before.  And there's no rhyme or reason as to why it's not working on one night and it works  fine the next night.  Yeah.  I mean, you could have like a joke that has worked 99 times and then you do it the 100th  time and something weird, you know, doesn't work.  Is it the crowd most of the time or is it you like what what does that?  What's the old what's the old expression?  Never blame the audience, even though it's always their fault. 
[02:38:00]  That's great.  That quote someone I think like Chappelle or someone said, like, jokes are like tires,  like eventually they lose their tread.  Oh, and I believe that because I feel like I think eventually the audience can sense you've  lost your enthusiasm.  Right.  Oh, wow.  It's like the super subtle thing.  I think it's a variation of the thing.  Like whenever you do crowd work and you come up with something in the moment that always  destroys and you can kind of try to recreate that.  It'll never have that same laugh.  But I think that thing that makes people laugh harder because something's coming from the 
[02:38:30]  moment.  It's also the same thing when you tell a joke and it's very fresh and you're still excited  by it.  There's subtle weird things that you I think people pick up on.  It's a lot.  It's a lot.  It's corny to say that, but they feel something.  That makes sense.  There's a real.  Yeah.  A genuine enthusiasm or genuine belief in the joke.  And then I think over time when you said it so many times and you hate it.  Although there's some people that have done the same jokes and I don't know how we still 
[02:39:00]  have enthusiasm.  I want to hug them.  Like, how do you say that again?  I mean, there are bits I see people do.  Like when I started comedy.  Oh, my God.  11 years ago.  Doing the same bit.  To this day.  Like 10 years, 11 years.  I'm like, wow.  With that fake little chuckle like they just thought of it.  Why do they do that?  I mean, it's like, I think it's like Jim said.  You kind of want to hug them.  You're like, great.  I mean, I don't know.  I want to go back to Jimmy.  So, because I did have one last question. 
[02:39:30]  So, you're bomb on stage.  The woman doesn't really know you.  You're trying to impress her.  Now, you have to walk up to her.  What's your move?  Well, what you do is you walk out of the way.  This comedy.  And again, I'm just using the cellar as the example physically.  You walk out of the cellar and then they'll usually come off the jump seat and follow  you up.  And then you got to quietly walk up the steps with them behind you.  And I'll go like, are you hungry?  You want to hop it or something?  Or I'll be having some poison.  No eye contact, huh?  I ate already.  My balls.  No, but here's what I do. 
[02:40:00]  You got to warn them beforehand.  Like, you do it subtly.  You don't say like, this might not be good.  You go like, yeah, I'm just working on some material.  I'm just working on stuff.  It's all a shit.  It's like if you're going to have sex and you're afraid you're going to lose your erection,  I'll always go like, yeah, I flew today.  I took Ramamine or I'm really tired just in case I can't stay hard.  It's like I built in the excuse beforehand.  I jerked off four times before you came over.  Could have an issue.  Yeah, but it's like you try to set it up beforehand.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's embarrassing.  Oh, man.  It's got to be.  And I like that it's embarrassing because it makes you feel like at least you give a shit 
[02:40:30]  about it.  You're not delusional as to how it's going.  Well, now Twitter's helping us with the interview.  Thanks, guys.  This guy writes, A Night Out with Kanye West.  A must listen.  It's hilarious.  Oh, yes.  It's a track from my first album.  All right.  I'm going to go check that out.  How did you guys meet?  He came to a show at, you know, Largo in Los Angeles?  I do, yeah.  He came to a show I did there.  Is he a nice guy?  He is.  He comes across like he might not be a nice guy sometimes.  He's totally different than I think people's perception of him. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  And he's totally aware of it.  And he's super funny.  Like, he's a funny dude.  And then someone says there's a feud between your cousin and Kanye?  That was one of the bits in that last special.  Yeah.  Where, yeah, I mean, as a while ago, I don't remember the details.  Did you want to punch your cousin in the face for almost ruining your Kanye West relationship?  Did he almost ruin your friendship with Kanye?  Your friendship?  No, no.  It was a joke.  Oh, okay.  Because nothing worse than when you have a famous friend and one of your friends is being confrontational. 
[02:41:30]  You're like, who'd you vote for?  You're like, just shut up.  Don't bring up politics, please.  Could you not do that?  I love and hate bringing people to the cellar.  Because, like, I love it because it's my home and I'm comfortable there.  But it's just like whenever you walk in and you see certain people at the table, you're  like, oh, this is going to get ugly fast.  Why does Keith have to be here?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's the last person you want to see when you have a guest is fucking Keith Robinson with  a glass of wine at the fucking table.  Oh, no.  Like, oh, no.  Oh, who the fuck is that?  Yeah, hey, stupid.  Could you not do that? 
[02:42:00]  It's the vice president of the United States.  Could you not call me that in front of him?  You know he's just going to ruin it.  Of course.  But it is funny to me to talk to other comics about just eating our balls and guys that  do, and I don't call it other guys who are doing the same material, but I just can't  comprehend how that feels satisfying.  Yeah, I'm not, like, shitting on those guys or anything.  It's just, oh, it's just.  It's not your cup of tea, huh?  Exactly.  Yeah, it's just.  Doing the same stuff. 
[02:42:30]  You really, it's very hard, I guess, to do topical stuff and keep that.  But what type of material is it that people just do over and over again?  Now, I will mention somebody.  Oh, really?  No, I mean, we all know Kevin.  Kevin Meaney?  Kevin Meaney will do this.  Oh, yeah, Kevin's been doing the act for a long time.  He's been doing great with the same act for 25, 30 years.  Well, he's changed it up since he came out of the closet.  Has he?  A lot of people say that.  But he did his We Are the World bit for, it had to be 10 years after the fact.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  But it killed every fucking time.  I know, yeah, yeah.  I used to, when we were off, I was in L.A. a lot, and I was hanging out at the comedy  store, and year after year, you'd see the same comics doing the exact same material.  And to me, I'm thinking.  Yeah, it just seems like there's no, I guess, again, I'm not like shitting or crazy, but  it's just more, it's like, what is the point of that?  Like, I just don't get the, I just don't get why you would show, like, why would you  show up and do that for 20 minutes?  Why not just go out and hang out or something?  Well, it's not like a ton of money you're making from a comedy club spot. 
[02:43:30]  My thought being, though, with the comedy store, a lot of comics are hoping to be discovered  there.  And I'm thinking, all right, you did this material last year, you're still in the same  spot with your career doing the exact same material.  Why wouldn't you try to mix it up just in case those people are in the audience and,  you know, give them a different look?  Or maybe that's not good enough.  Why not try to improve?  Yeah, right.  But you get people like, I remember, like, you would see, like, when I did open mics  when I was starting out, you would see people do these bits that would just fail. 
[02:44:00]  And they would just keep doing them over and over.  It's like, hey, man, this is like kind of trial and error a little bit.  That's an error.  Yeah, yeah, that's, uh...  Oh, wow.  That wasn't supposed to happen.  It almost fit, though.  That was perfect, yes.  You're talking about somebody bombing and you hit the crickets.  I was leaning over to take a picture of Aziz for Twitter.  I want to argue some sound effects.  I know, no shit.  My elbow's smarter than me.  But it is something more in L.A., I think.  But I think you're right.  It's because of people afraid that, like, literally, that's where television is. 
[02:44:30]  And you're afraid that you're going to be doing something new.  And that's when the fucking guy from CBS is in the audience.  Does anybody really get discovered in clubs anymore?  I mean, no.  People type people's name in YouTube and watch it.  Oh, that guy's funny.  Really?  Bum-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Let me watch his stuff.  Oh, that is funny.  Oh, it's not funny.  Yeah, it's not 1983.  People think that fucking, what, Johnny's people are going to walk in and go,  you're a kid?  Come to L.A.  Rupert Pupkin.  Yeah, I mean, tape and then...  Yeah, anyone that's really going to cast something big or whatever, they're not going to comedy 
[02:45:00]  clubs anymore.  But I wonder, you know, you said something about Kevin Meany coming out of the closet.  I wonder if people who do the same thing over and over again...  Are gay?  Yeah, they're all gay.  Yes.  Do they just, do they adored penises?  No, but is there something that they can't talk about that, like, almost to explore further  comedically might delve into that area?  Like, almost like they're trapped in this little area.  This is my time.  This is what I do.  Or is it that they smoke pot and that they're lazy?  Or, like, what is it?  I just, I don't fucking get it. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I guess it's like, the thing that just puzzles me is, like, I would, like, if you're  like, you gotta say the same 10 minutes of stuff every night, you can't change it.  I would be like, oh, I don't, there's no joy in that.  I would guess they probably sit down to write something new and just go, I need cock right  now.  I need cock.  Instead of the pen and the ground penis.  Right, right.  It's like, I was gonna write, but fuck.  Isolate.  Oh, of course.  I mean, it's like a musician who does, like, their, like, big hits. 
[02:46:00]  And, like, I was at something, it was like, uh, some fancy thing and Sting was performing  and he gets up there and he just goes, every breath, and, like, everyone goes crazy.  It's like, yes, he just doesn't get tired of that.  Like, you know, everyone loves that song and, you know, and then if you're a comedian and  you're speaking at that event, it's like, you gotta, like, come up with something  brand new that's just as good as everything else you've ever done and most people are  gonna be disappointed in you.  It really does stink for comics, and I complain about this all the time, it's the nature of  the beast, like, the bands can do the same shit forever, but if we do the same joke two 
[02:46:30]  tours in a row, people are like, oh, we should have known you were doing the same stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, Jesus, dude, it's only been fucking eight months.  Yeah.  It's not every breath you take.  Yeah.  No, not at all.  Yeah.  How good does it feel to have a fucking new hour, though?  Like, when you got one hour busted out and done and taped.  And now you're out on tour with another hour.  It's just a great feeling.  It's great.  I love touring.  Like, you know, touring and doing these theaters, it's the most, it's the most fun. 
[02:47:00]  And to have, like, a new hour that I'm really excited about, you know, it's good.  I worked really hard to make this.  I think this one's my strongest one, the one I'm gonna tour.  You do.  The special's good, too, but.  Do you do a lot of, do you do, oh, yeah, by the way, Aziz is promoting the special,  Dangerously Delicious.  It's for five bucks, azizansari.com.  And you don't have to have, the thing that's great about this is you don't have to have  any certain dish network or cable or fucking any of that stuff.  It's immediate.  You don't have to wait for it to be on.  You can just go to his site.  Down.  Do you have to have, like, a shitload of bandwidth to pull this off?  Like, how do you do this on a website?  I have one friend that knows a lot about the internet. 
[02:47:30]  And I was like, I'm gonna give you this much money, handle everything.  Make it work.  Yeah.  And he's just, like, a smart guy, and then he's done a lot of stuff, so he did it.  But, yeah, it's been cool.  I mean, it's cool to just have it direct.  Like, you feel a lot more connected with the people that, like, bought it.  Like, whenever, like, whenever you buy, there's a thing like, oh, if you like this, you know,  maybe tweet about it to tell your friends.  And, like, I see all those ones.  They're like, oh, hey, I just bought Aziz a special.  You should check it out.  And it's like, oh, when people do that, you're like, man, thank you so much. 
[02:48:00]  You know, you really appreciate it.  And, you know, like, I never felt that way about, like, oh, you know,  whatever other things.  Like, someone buying a Parks and Recreation DVD, obviously, I appreciate that support.  But this is a much more personal thing.  Because you created it from scratch.  And it really is weird when you dream about being a comic or when you're a kid and you  think, like, I want to do stand-up someday.  And it just seems like this unattainable reality.  And then when you stop and go, like, man, I really make my living fucking doing.  And, again, you know, if I said this to Colin, he'd go, shut the fuck up, you maudlin' idiot.  And he'd be right to say that. 
[02:48:30]  But you really do once in a while go, like, fuck, man.  Like, especially when you have something to look at and go, like, I did that.  And it actually worked.  And people buy it.  Yeah.  I just wanted to really bore everybody with it.  Thanks, Jim.  You're fucking behind the scenes.  You're digging in deep into your son.  Yeah, deep into your son.  Exactly.  I should just make a Hallmark card and then hang myself.  Fucking zero.  Again, I'm just trying.  Anytime I say something nice like that, I'm just trying to not delve into tranny talk,  which is where I really want to go.  You know, getting back to the material thing, Joe in Virginia, I don't know if this is true. 
[02:49:00]  He said he saw Seinfeld twice in 10 years, same material.  I don't think that's true.  Yeah, unless it was one joke.  Seinfeld did the same act for a while because he retired his act.  He was a documentary comedian about him writing The New Hour.  I liked that documentary.  Right, and retiring him.  But he had been doing Seinfeld for all those years.  It's hard to put together a new hour when you're on probably the second biggest show in the history of fucking television.  And, like, in every scene, like, running everything.  Like, I'm able to do stand-up while I do Parks and Recreation, but that's, like, an ensemble thing. 
[02:49:30]  And, like, you know, if I was doing the same workload as, like, Amy Poehler, I would not be able to do any stand-up, I don't think.  And I don't think it's as bad if Seinfeld does it because a lot of his stuff is timeless, obviously.  Yeah.  You know?  It's not really topical.  Not topical at all, I would assume.  I haven't seen him in years, but.  He comes into the cellar and he'll bomb.  Like, and he likes to go on and have stuff and not get laughs.  Like, meaning he wants the laughs.  He's a billionaire.  When you're a billionaire, I think you might accept things differently.  Dude, when you're up there and you fucking say into the mic something and it gets a zero.  Doesn't matter how big your bank account is. 
[02:50:00]  No.  No.  You're like, God, they see through the money.  They see through everything.  They know.  They know I'm a fraud.  You don't think of your successes when something's not working.  You just think of, in the moment, low fucking comedian self-esteem.  Let's say it's over.  I'm done.  I mean, when you go on stage, people are pretty much, like, prove yourself.  Right.  You know?  Even if they're, like, going crazy, they recognize you or whatever, like, you know, that euphoria lasts  for, like, I don't know if euphoria is the right word, but, you know what I mean?  Like, that excitement lasts for a couple of minutes and then you really have, you're 
[02:50:30]  just a person saying words and they have to get a response.  Well, you can't be afraid of not getting laughs either.  Like, that's why I think another reason guys don't do the same shit, because if you're  afraid you're not going to get laughs, it's like, take the risk.  It's a fucking Tuesday.  Yeah.  Someone was like, oh, you know, I've seen you do sets and you always do really well.  And it's like, well, that's bad, because that means I'm not taking enough risks and stretching  out enough to go into zones maybe I'm not comfortable in.  That was someone, somebody once told me that, just like, just like a generic piece of advice. 
[02:51:00]  It's like, oh, be really comfortable in silence.  Yeah.  Because once, like, I mean, you watch, like, Attal, like, he doesn't look phased at all.  Like, I still, like, I can't help but get phased a little bit.  Like, you watch your mom, like, he just doesn't, you just can tell it doesn't affect him at  all.  He's so above it.  It's so cool to see.  I can tell when Attal is uncomfortable.  It's not because of, he'll go, Attal will say this thing, and I've noticed him do it  very few times, but he'll say something like, do you know what I'm saying?  Or he'll say something like that. 
[02:51:30]  Like, or do you know what I'm saying?  Like, and to me, that's Attal being slightly rigorous in the moment, because it's rare that he  does that.  And sometimes he'll just do it because he's trying to structure something or whatever,  but I'm like, oh, that's a weird, like, a little thing.  Because I've seen him go up there and alienate everybody, and he couldn't.  Oh, yeah.  He's the best.  He's more comfortable than I am in my living room.  Yeah.  He's so happy.  Every time I watch Attal, he makes me laugh.  It's like, it literally, every fucking time.  How many years has that guy done it?  But I don't know, he's probably a 25-year veteran, 24. 
[02:52:00]  I don't even like watching him anymore.  We're touring together, and, you know, June 9th, me, him, Arnie Lang, Nick DiPaolo, Foxwoods.  But I can't watch because it's depressing.  He's so fucking funny, it depresses me to watch.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the guy you watch, and he's like constantly coming up with new, great stuff,  and he's been doing it like 20-something years.  Does he wing it sometimes on stage?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's brave.  And it's fucking...  How many guys do that?  And it's not formulaic.  Like, the formula he uses...  Dave makes it look really easy because it's so random, some of it. 
[02:52:30]  Right, right.  But it's like, whatever his formula or style is, it is absolutely original and unique to him.  Mm-hmm.  And it's just, for some reason, it's always something that you don't think of.  And it fucking makes me sick to my stomach.  Yeah.  I hope his lips fall off.  Yeah, it's like he just comes up with these amazing specifics that are...  You know, they say this thing, it's like, oh, you use your third idea because the first  idea is the one everyone would think of.  The second one is your kind of thing, and the third one is the one that's really unexpected 
[02:53:00]  and that'll make people laugh.  And with him, it's like, it seems like it's like he's able to get to the 56th idea or something  because it's so out there.  You're like, what?  Yeah, I never heard that, though, but it's a good idea.  Use your third...  Because I always think, like, if you...  Like, I didn't tweet this, the Dick Cheney heart thing.  The first thing I thought of was, well, he never had a heart, so I didn't tweet it because  I'm like, eh, it's probably...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm glad I didn't know everybody was going with that one, right?  Yeah.  Do you know this comic, Joe Mandy?  Do you know him?  He's a young comic.  Mm-mm.  He has this bit where he's like, he's like, he was doing a show and it was like a college 
[02:53:30]  show, and then the kid said something like, that was running the show, was like, oh, like, don't  say the N-word or, you know, don't say, you know, some, like, really awful shit.  And he was just like, yeah, I'm not going to do that.  Oh, shit.  And then he was like, that would be like if I had a plumber come to my house and I was  like, hey, can you do me a favor?  Can you not eat my dog's pussy out?  And I was like, wow, that's an amazing specific. 
[02:54:00]  Because that's like, when are you going to get to that if you're, like, playing a Mad Lib?  I was like, when are you going to get to eat my dog's pussy out?  Maybe laugh so hard.  And it's also, it's also true.  It's like the ridiculous examples they'll give you to not.  Do you do colleges?  I do maybe one a year.  They don't, I'm not in big demand with the college students.  I do do colleges.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fun.  They're good.  I've always been nervous at colleges for some, maybe because I dropped out of high school.  I don't recognize any of the curriculum.  Sometimes they're a little tight with some of the darker stuff, but if you push through 
[02:54:30]  it, they'll eventually be fine.  And as long as you kind of, you know, walk them to the edge, if you will, as far as, you  know, getting, starting off with less darker stuff and then getting darker.  It is weird, right?  To have to hold their hand and kind of bring them and go, it's okay.  Yeah.  But you got to do, you know, I mean, you kind of forget, like, you know, you know, I'm like  you, we do the cellar all the time and they're like, that crowd is really up for some  really dark blue stuff and you get kind of desensitized.  Like I was doing, you know, some really dark stuff.  And then I was, I did some random private event where there was a lot of like older people 
[02:55:00]  and I was like, oh, they'll be on board with this shit.  This stuff kills.  It's so funny.  It doesn't matter how dark it is.  It's just like, it's just like works on a, you know, better level.  And they're like very uncomfortable with it.  I was like, oh man, I got to remember not everyone is New York City comedy cellar audience.  Was it a corporate gig?  I don't know.  It was some sort of corporate private thing.  Yeah.  Those are hard, man.  Yeah.  I mean, it was like 60, like people, you know, that banded together and had this company, 
[02:55:30]  real estate company or something.  I don't know.  Oh, those are the works.  The money is great.  Yeah.  But it's fucking, it's so personal.  It's like literally you're standing, you feel like you're standing, you're bothering  people while they eat.  Yeah.  I mean, they were sitting there finishing and it honestly feels, it's, I mean, it's not  like dance monkey dance, but it's a little bit like, yes, we brought you here.  Entertain us.  It's not like, oh, I'm excited to see you.  I bought a ticket to the show.  It's not that vibe at all.  It's the court jester.  Yeah.  And the worst is where they want you to do a lot of time because you always go, well,  how much time do you want?  And it's like, if they're like, well, could you do an hour and 20? 
[02:56:00]  But if they're like, look, we got a bunch of stuff.  Can you do eight?  Yes.  I'm happy to do eight.  Happy to do eight minutes.  Yeah.  People think they're punishing us when we do short sets of those things.  Like you can't fucking get on stage fast enough.  I'm really sorry, but we can only use you for like eight minutes.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  I really want to do it and get out of here.  I'll make it work.  I'm always terrified of those things.  Like it's a validation.  Like for some reason, I think that those things are validating that I'm awful.  Like I'm always waiting to be exposed as being a terrible comedian. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, those things are, it's different because if you do a show, it's people that like you  and they're coming and they're going to be on your side.  This is like, you're kind of thrown out there to people that may not know you or care or  be excited at all.  And shoving something in his face and he goes, oh, there's a comedian?  Yeah.  And turns around like, oh God, he didn't even know.  It doesn't care.  Yeah.  That's the thing.  It's like, you're kind of just put out there, comedian, you know, person that'll say things  that make you laugh.  That's it.  There's nothing like, oh, it's this guy from this thing or whatever.  It's like, we got a comedian.  It's almost like a clown or a juggler. 
[02:57:00]  Right.  You know?  And it's like, they're like, this guy, I'm going to watch him juggle.  Let's see if he's a good juggler.  Yeah.  And it's almost like they're hiring you.  Like, we're going to eat dinner and then we'd like you to draw this emotion from us.  Because that is what comedy is.  It's a weird thing where you, you know, not to floss, but it's like people are going there  just to have this thing pulled out of them.  All right, Socrates.  But, you know, settlement moments with Jim Morton.  But it's like, it's a weird psychology.  Like, I, you know, I don't understand what it is. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, it is.  It is odd.  It's like, okay, there, now make us feel something.  Yeah.  But, uh, couldn't it be another emotion?  Like, you cry.  To just go there and just say horrible things.  That would be interesting.  The whole audience just crying.  Just really sad stories.  He's fantastic.  He was so good.  No, I'm not a good sad storyteller either.  I think I'm going to have like a moment and it's just like, shut up.  Oh, no.  Do you revert back to young Jimmy where you're just, with your boombox and your fucking, what  song would you used to play on it?  It doesn't matter. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, it does.  It kind of does.  Aziz needs to know.  Iron Man?  Iron Man.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, what?  You don't, nah, just walking by a girl's house wanting the certain lyrics to play at a  certain time.  So she, you know, just a complete douchebag.  Just a complete zero.  I think that movie ripped you off.  Which one?  Oh, yeah, the one with him.  What?  You talking about the John Cusack?  Yeah, yeah, John Cusack.  No, I never saw that.  Thank God.  What was the song?  In Your Eyes?  Say Anything.  Say Anything.  Thank you.  They ripped you off, Jimmy.  Which lyrics did you want her to hear, by the way? 
[02:58:30]  I honestly don't remember.  I mean, this is, I'm kind of thinking which lyrics in Iron Man.  Going back six months.  I know.  I don't really know.  It's just the beat of it.  I think you know.  I really don't.  No, I mean, I'm.  You know that song with the back of your hand.  Ted, like, it takes a minute to find it, and then, boom.  Probably the opening, where he goes, I am Iron Man.  I guess that was powerful and cool.  I was drunk.  Look, Iron Man's walking by.  Oh, look, there's a man of steel.  He's walking down the sidewalk.  The Iron Man is back again. 
[02:59:00]  He doesn't know I love this song, too.  That was the girl I used to write love letters to, but anonymously.  It was really creepy.  Right.  Secret admirer.  She came to the stress factory recently, like maybe three years ago, and she brought me  a love letter I had written her, and she had it saved.  I read it on the show.  Oh, right, right.  Yes.  Oh, God.  It was so douchey.  Yeah, it was anonymous.  If you want to know who I am, wear a scarf the next thing.  Ugh.  Ugh.  It's like I know who you are.  Hang yourself with a scarf.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, good.  Aziz and Zari. 
[02:59:30]  I can't do it.  Sleep delicious.  It's available.  $5 on his website.  And again, you guys are setting a standard here, which I really like for comedians, because  Yeah, it's great.  You don't have to deal with standards and practices from the network.  That's, yeah, that and the no commercials, that's another reason I really wanted to do  it.  And international.  Oh, right.  Like, those three things.  Like, you know, I was in England last year, and people were like, oh, we can't get your  special here.  And I was in India over the Christmas break, and kids there, like, they, like, torrent, 
[03:00:00]  like, every TV show.  Oh, man.  And they love watching it, because, you know, now there's all these, like, lags between  how things air here and then internationally.  But with the internet, people know what's airing, and they want to keep up, but the people  are too stupid to give them a way to do it easily and legally, so they torrent it.  And then with this, it's like, oh, if you're anywhere, you can get it.  Like, I'm not going to, I don't need to release it three months later to people in Germany or  whatever.  Just get it.  Yeah, the release date for Europe is, same fucking day. 
[03:00:30]  Come on.  Yeah, it makes no sense.  And then, you know, the commercials and everything, like, yeah, you see a special on TV, and,  you know, they're editing, like, 20 minutes out of it.  Yeah, 42 minutes for the hour, right?  Jesus.  And, yeah, and it's, like, cut in weird spots, and, you know, this, it's like, you can put  it out, and it's the same experience as going to see an hour of stand-up at a concert.  Did you, how do they, how long does it take to download normally?  I mean, is it a, have you figured out how to make it where it's a pretty easy thing to download?  It's easy to download, or you can stream it, like, Netflix, either way. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, so you can either stream it, or download it, or both.  And so, but if you download it, you can keep it.  If you download it, you can keep it, burn it, and put it on your iPad, or iPod, or whatever.  Yeah, the download doesn't take nothing for an hour.  It's so, it's so smart to do that, and it's like, again, the guys who are doing it now,  eventually that market will open up for guys who have less of a following, but it's fucking,  for international, it's phenomenal.  I mean, the problem, the only barrier to entry right now is, like, you do, I mean, everyone  said this in all the interviews and stuff I've done, is like, oh, you have to have, like,  a certain amount of following.  You know, me and Louis have a following already, so it's, but the big thing is, like, to shoot 
[03:01:30]  one of those specials and pay for yourself, it is really expensive.  Yeah.  But, what I was thinking is, if, like, if someone did it with a CD, it could still do  the same thing, and a CD costs, like, a couple thousand dollars to produce, it's much less  cheaper than a video special, like, to shoot that really well and stuff, it could be, like,  you know, you can spend as much as, like, 250 grand, and setting up the website and all  that shit, it's expensive, but if you just did a CD, I bet you could be, have a smaller  following, and you could still be able to get it. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, right, yeah.  Did you have to tweak your site to get that much stuff on it?  Like, did your friend have to go back, like, in the back and do, like, a whole bunch of  stuff to it?  Yeah, he had to make the site work, and, you know, I don't, you know, it's technical stuff  I didn't want to have to deal with, so, you know, like I said, I just gave him, you know,  a check, I was like, I'm gonna trust you can take care of all this and everything will  work fine, but, you know, and I was involved in, like, all the language and stuff, you know,  and made sure it sounded right and didn't sound like it.  It'd be hilarious if he came back and said, here, here you go, and it's like all those  1990s animated idiots on there. 
[03:02:30]  It could have been horrible.  Those rotating police beacons next to a horrible banner of your name.  That actually would be really funny if it did look like that.  Bouncing Aziz across.  Hello.  You're fucking 300 on the website.  The first guy that downloads, you have two downloads, it crashes.  No, no, I think if I reboot it every second download, it'd be kind of keep you in touch.  Do you have a mailing list, an email list?  Yeah, I have one, but, you know, it's really, everyone just checks Twitter and stuff. 
[03:03:00]  They do, right?  Yeah, because, I don't know, I feel like mailing, like, if you buy the special, there's a thing  to sign up for the mailing list.  What do you think the next step after Twitter is?  Because that's what I kind of wonder, because now that I'm doing okay on Twitter, I know  it'll go away.  I don't know.  Yeah, I thought the same thing.  It is really helpful.  I think Twitter is just going to continue to develop.  Yeah, it's going to be around.  I hope so.  Good, because you can be funny on it, and you can also be like, oh, by the way, I'm going  to be in Kansas, and people in Kansas will be like, cool, I'll come.  And, yeah, and it's crazy to have that kind of direct link to people that like your stuff. 
[03:03:30]  And mailing list, I feel like you're just annoying people always, because you can't  email them anything of worth, and then also email them, like, a plug for something.  With Twitter, you can give people something they actually enjoy, and then also be like,  oh, by the way, I have a special out.  There is a fine line with some people, as far as plugging goes, and giving people, you  know, some funny shit about some, you know, the news, or whatever's going on in their life.  Like, I like that.  I've followed a few people, and after a couple of weeks, you realize, all I'm getting are  plugs as to where this person's going to be, and it's like, it's not, why do I care? 
[03:04:00]  I try to be sensitive to that stuff, especially with the special, you know, I've been like,  oh, I don't want to like fucking blast it in people's places, but at the same time,  it's like, oh, I did like spend a lot of money on this.  I get to get it back, man.  I get to have to, which is fine, but as long as you're giving people, you know, a couple  of chuckles.  Yeah, yeah.  Put a joke with it, like two Jews walk into a bar, they bought my special.  They fucking slap people.  There we go.  Yeah, sometimes you put...  I tricked you.  See, you thought you were about to laugh, but you were being sold.  Oh, Jimmy.  I guess we're done for the day. 
[03:04:30]  Of course, we are.  We all get to leave.  Yeah, man.  Yay.  Aziz finally made it in here.  Very happy, Aziz.  So fun, man.  Thanks so much for having me down.  And go to Aziz's site to get his dates and his special.  Azizansari.com.  Or on Twitter, the same.  His name on Twitter.  Exactly.  And then Park's coming back on the 19th of April.  Yep.  Great show on NBC.  Thanks so much.  And I will be at Caroline's Thursday through Sunday.  Saturday is sold out, so Thursday, Friday, and Sunday are available.  So if you want to come, please, I'm begging, come. 
[03:05:00]  I want to go.  All right.  What if I want to go on the sold out day?  Be happy to sell you a few tickets.  I'd love to sell you tickets.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Thanks so much.  Cheers.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  We'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
