<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed a chaotic day centered around a series of stunts and misadventures involving staff and listeners.  The show began with a discussion of a staff party at La Barba, highlighting the intoxicated behavior of Gary Blum and Chuck from the Chick show, who subsequently went on the air drunk. Opie recounted a conversation with his boss about Anthony's career progression.  A significant portion focused on the absence of Spaz, a staff member, from the party, which was heavily criticized by Opie and Anthony, particularly in contrast to Spaz's employee, Stinky, who bonded with General Manager Ken Stevens (who was brought into the studio).  This led to a planned stunt: Spaz, in his Boy Scout uniform, would stand outside the studio with a sign saying "Abuse me for five bucks."  The hosts detailed Spaz's uniform and Boy Scout oath, also mentioning a "Girls of O&A" contest on the unofficial website and updates on Earl's attempts to reach the Staten Island Mall for a "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" promotion.

The planned Spaz stunt, involving listeners verbally abusing him for money, became the show's central focus.  Spaz, significantly in debt,  instead escalated the situation by using offensive and racial slurs, attracting a large crowd, police, and significant media attention.  The chaos involved honking cars, onlookers joining in the insults, and eventually, Spaz's arrest for using racial slurs. Psycho Mark, a show staffer, was also involved, having nearly been arrested the previous night for public intoxication and antagonizing police.  His misadventures included a street confrontation involving racial slurs.  Earl's "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" promotion at the Staten Island Mall also ended in a confrontation with mall security and police due to traffic congestion. The show incorporated audio of Earl’s distress, Psycho Mark’s antics,  a song parodying Ben Stein with ethnic slurs, a new song about Spaz, contributions from Joe (Anthony's brother), and numerous listener calls from those at the mall and outside the studio. Stockbroker Dave called in, recounting Wall Street pranks, which segued into a segment attempting to attract women to the studio.  A professional escort expressed interest in a contest involving an inanimate object and $500 from Stockbroker Dave.  Spaz's arrest and a tearful phone call from the police car were discussed.

The show further featured a major conflict with another radio station—allegedly harassing listeners with a bullhorn and assaulting a female listener, Allegra (who was 18). This led to an on-air game of "What's in My Pants" with Allegra, followed by the arrival of Janice, a professional escort, and Leo, her boyfriend. This resulted in more sexually suggestive discussions and continued “What's in My Pants” games with money and gifts from Stockbroker Dave.  The hosts used highly offensive and vulgar language throughout, drawing parallels between Spaz's situation and the show "Oz."  Listener calls continued, with many using offensive language to describe Spaz and the situation. Big Kevin, Spaz's bodyguard, confirmed Spaz’s use of insults.  The hosts discussed Spaz's financial struggles related to his arrest.  Commercial breaks for Rockaway Bedding were interspersed throughout.

A later segment involved a female participant engaging in a sexually suggestive act on air involving a bat, described with offensive terms.  A phone number for an escort service was provided on air. Stockbroker Dave participated in a "Win Dave's Money" game, with the prize going to the female participant.  The show concluded with banter about the day's events, including the sexual act, Spaz’s arrest, and anticipation of the next show, described as being "at the brink of war,"  with humorous, sexually suggestive remarks between Opie and Anthony.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You guys sometimes, like, piss me off, okay?  Are we ready to broadcast today, Anthony?  Hell yeah!  Give me a hell yeah!  Oh, hell yeah!  Hell yeah!  I'm gonna crush him with my big fat beer belly!  Oh, hell yeah!  Hell yeah! 
[00:00:30]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone line.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Gonna open up a can of vanilla frosting on your ass.  And eat it.  Get bigger and fatter.  Of course it's gone cold.  Hey, what's up, man?  Ah, what is up?  What is it up, Anthony?  Say hi to my boys at Apollo Air Conditioning, Opie.  Saw them on 56th Street, Anthony.  Yeah, see, you know, I remember my roots.  And the tin knocking trade. 
[00:01:00]  I saw we were leaving lunch.  I saw one of the Apollo trucks.  Figured I'd, you know, talk to the guy.  Couldn't find him, though.  If that were me, I'd probably be at the booby bar.  I should have looked there.  It was pretty funny, because I was walking back from lunch with our boss, Ken, and you  went off to find the Apollo guys.  And Ken's like, I thought that was all a joke.  You mean that was real?  Like, Anthony went right from air conditioning right into being a radio star?  And I'm like, yeah, believe it or not, there was no real in between. 
[00:01:30]  No.  One minute he's installing air conditioners, and the next he's giving out autographs and  having a good old time.  Yeah.  I'm occasionally still on the street.  It's like, hey, Anthony.  I'm like, ha, ha, they must listen to the show.  Hey, could you come by and put another outlet in in my living room?  It's getting a little warm.  Call the guy.  Yeah, I said hi to Tom and Tony.  How you doing?  There you go. 
[00:02:00]  Steve, what's going on?  How did that Rick incident end yesterday?  What Rick incident?  The supposed pictures on the website in the yellow Miata.  That's all I know.  How did that end?  Well, let's see.  Let's get Rick in to talk about it.  Oh, Rick's not here.  Let's ask Rick.  Rick?  Rick?  Hello.  Hey, Rick.  Rick?  Rick?  Rick?  Hey, go, Rick.  Rick? 
[00:02:30]  Rick?  No, Rick.  Uh-oh.  All right, Steve, thanks for the call.  No problem.  We had a great time last night.  We should start with that, Anthony.  Wow.  Yeah.  We had a huge staff party last night.  Over at La Barba.  Kind of a rating slash get-to-know-everyone type of party.  Yeah.  I think it was the first time all the new programs were together in one room.  Uh-huh.  And everyone got along, which was amazing.  Well, add alcohol and, you know, everybody gets along. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Some of the funniest radio I think I ever heard was, uh, Ron and Fez last night.  After the party, some of the drunks stumbled back into the studio and, uh, went on the air.  Gary Blum, man.  Oh, my God.  I was driving home.  The straight-laced Gary Blum.  We're listening to, uh, Ron and Fez.  And Gary Blum and, uh, Chuck from the Chick show were in here. 
[00:03:30]  Smashed.  Blum was talking, and I swear to God it was coming out like,  Well, you didn't have a good time.  I was like, what?  I took, I did a double take on my radio.  Yeah.  And then they had Dr. Demento on.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, Gary's, like, trying to talk to him.  He's go,  Yeah, I remember you, Dr. Menento.  Dr. Menento.  Memento.  Many, 22 years ago.  Uh, he's going into the story when he used to sell for KTU, when it was Disco 92, and 
[00:04:00]  they made money hand over the fist, and it's, like, oh, my God, what are they doing?  Yeah.  So after an hour, I guess, uh, they started, from what Ron and Fez said, they started sobering  up and realized they were destroying their show, so they left.  Weren't you pranking the show last night?  Dude, I was five callers last night on the Ron and Fez show, and they didn't know it was  you, right?  No, they kept hanging up on me.  It was so funny.  I told people, uh, to avoid having, uh, the radio on when Gary Blum's talking, because 
[00:04:30]  I think that was enough to give you a deewee.  If you had him on your radio, they would have hauled you in, just by having a drunk, that  drunk on the air.  He's, he's so straight-laced during the day, too.  That's what makes that funny.  Oh, my God.  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't think he had it in him to get that liggered up.  I kept putting on different voices.  I'm getting past their screeners.  It was pretty funny.  That is funny.  Hey, where's Spaz, because, uh, Spaz missed the, uh, the party last night.  Spaz?  Hey, Spaz. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, Spaz.  Spaz misses all the parties.  Grab that mic over there so we can take a look at you.  Spaz?  Spaz, we've discussed this on our show, um, in the last few weeks or so.  You want to get closer to everybody?  Yes.  You want to get closer to myself?  You want to get closer to Anthony?  You want to get to know us outside the station, right?  Yes.  And get closer to management.  And closer to everyone that works here at N.E.W.  Yes.  A good suck-up, Opie, is somebody who, uh, goes to management and, uh, kisses some ass.  There was a lot of ass kissing last night. 
[00:05:30]  But you gotta have the ass in front of you to kiss it, right?  Yeah.  And, and Spaz keeps missing these events that the bosses are at.  What do you think?  Ken Stevens and Jeremy go to everything?  No.  Why'd you blow us off?  This was an important part of your career, I think.  And bring Stinky in, by the way.  Networking opportunity.  Stinky, of course, uh, Spaz's clone.  Stinky was there.  Uh, once again, Stinky on the beers.  I got, I love this kid.  Oh, he's great.  Every friggin' two seconds.  Anthony, you want a beer? 
[00:06:00]  You want a beer?  This guy knows how to kiss some ass.  He is the man.  And, uh, Stinky officially is Spaz's employee.  Yeah.  Um, and Stinky made the party.  Spaz did not.  Mm-hmm.  Not only did Stinky make the party.  Let me tell you something, Spaz.  Why don't you let Stinky tell everyone?  Anthony, how was your, uh, how was the party last night, Stinky?  It was very fun.  You liked talking with everybody, mingling?  Yeah, I even got to mingle with the, uh, head boss, Mr. Ken Stevens.  Oh, Ken Stevens.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:06:30]  Stinky and Ken Stevens.  I thought they were going to just go out to one of the strip joints after the party.  They were really, they were talking.  They were getting along.  We got, we got pictures of, uh, Stinky with his arm around Ken.  Arm around Ken, holding beers.  Holding beers.  Other pictures of them just, kind of a conversation, just casually talking.  How do you feel, Spaz?  Because your employee is now closer to the big boss than you.  Could have been you.  Could have been you.  A little angry.  Last night was a great opportunity to kiss some serious ass.  It's called networking.  It's called, like, schmoozing. 
[00:07:00]  And, and you, you missed it.  I couldn't go.  Stinky was right there, though.  Picking up your slack.  Talking with Ken Stevens.  Ken Stevens.  The GM.  Did you talk about me?  No.  There's no talking.  Here's our boss, Ken.  Ken Stevens, everyone.  How are you doing, Ken?  The one that has turned this place around.  Yes.  Now, Ken, did you enjoy your time with Stinky last night?  Oh, we had a great time.  Yeah.  See, the beers were popping.  All of a sudden, you guys are talking.  If I didn't have to go back to the hotel, we were going out. 
[00:07:30]  See?  And, uh, Spaz, for some reason, couldn't make it.  Now, as, as a boss, when you see, uh, something like that, as somebody who really wants to get close to  management, and they don't show up, what is that?  How does that come off to you?  Well, you know, you look around, and you kind of see who's there, and who's not there.  See?  Who's into it, and who's, like, got better things to do.  Right.  They notice.  They notice these things, Spaz.  I have a list.  Yeah.  See?  Huh?  I have a very good reason.  Yeah, but look, Stinky and Ken, they're standing next to each other. 
[00:08:00]  They're nodding.  Do you think there's a more important thing in your life right now than, uh, your career that  you're trying to build here?  And do you think that, that meeting the boss and hanging in a social event like that isn't  probably the most important thing you should be doing?  You could have probably given him the finger last night like you did to Jeremy.  Like you did to Jeremy.  That's how loose everyone was last night.  I had a very good reason.  Here's a guy that runs three or four stations for this company.  He, he, he had to be somewhere last night.  You want to get connected with the company? 
[00:08:30]  That's your man.  Yeah, I was kind of looking forward to it.  See?  Oh, Spaz, did you F up this time?  I apologize.  Spaz, don't apologize to us.  I apologize to Ken.  He's right in the studio.  Mr. Stevens.  I apologize for not being there last night.  No, it is not a problem.  Believe me.  I, I, I have very good legitimate reason.  Stupid!  Stop!  Stupid!  Maybe have a chat, get to know me better.  But I just had a very good reason last night for not being there.  Listen, it wasn't a command performance.  You don't have to be there. 
[00:09:00]  Sure.  You know what's funny, though?  But he did take note.  We'll have other parties.  He did take note, though.  You know what's funny, Spaz?  You still have to call him Mr. Stevens?  Stinky, say hi to Ken.  That's a good one, Ken.  Oh, I know you have a little pat on the back.  There it is.  It's Ken.  It's Ken.  Your employee gets to call him Ken.  I even said hi to him in the hallway today.  Really?  Hey.  And I'm sure he gave you a fine little hi.  Hello, how you doing?  Made eye contact and everything with you, right, Stink?  Spaz, did you say hi to Ken today when you saw him?  No, we kind of walked by each other. 
[00:09:30]  I didn't see him today, no.  The invisible Spaz.  So, Spaz, when do you think is going to be the next opportunity  where you're going to be able to bond with the big boss?  I hope very soon, Mr. Stevens.  I'm sure we'll have an opportunity soon.  Okay.  There you go.  There'll be other parties.  Yes.  Yeah, I hope so.  Stinky, would you like to say goodbye to Ken?  He's leaving to go work on another radio station for the company.  Have a good day, Ken.  There you go.  Ken.  Ken. 
[00:10:00]  See?  It's Ken.  This is the guy that works for you.  You call the boss Mr. Stevens.  It's Ken to Stinky.  I'm sure in a while it's probably just going to be, hey, Kenny.  Kenny, you know?  Hey, Kenny.  Hey, Kenny.  Ken-a-rama.  Hey, bud.  Hey, bud.  And then before you know it, you know when you really get palsy with somebody,  you just call them like, hey, you a-hole.  Come here.  And, you know, you drink and having fun.  And in the meantime, you'll be like, hello, Mr. Stevens.  Mr. Stevens.  And Stinky will be like, Kendo. 
[00:10:30]  Hey.  My man, Ken-a-rama.  Ken-a-rama.  The Ken-ster.  The Ken-a-rama.  Ken-a-rama.  Yeah.  Do you arrange a meeting with me with him?  He's asking Stinky to arrange a meeting.  Stinky is networking spaz.  Stinky's working.  He's getting to know it.  And I even, uh, Stinky and I, uh, shared a moment last night talking a little bit about,  uh, each other's, uh, careers and what we do outside the station.  Mm-hmm.  He's, he's, he's, he's setting himself up perfectly to take over for you.  He's bringing beers over. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  He's gonna, uh, don't tell me you're setting him up to take over me.  Well, you never know.  Well, you never know, man.  You think you can't do that to your boss?  I think your priorities are a little aft off spaz.  I had a, I had a very good reason.  You couldn't put that off, uh, a little bit?  Maybe today you could have done it, this morning?  No, because then I would have been late for work.  All right.  Well, you missed a great out of today.  Well, you know, if, if you prioritize, prioritize things and, and you put that in front of your 
[00:11:30]  career, that's fine.  I had to get my stuff out of the U-Haul.  I didn't want to be sitting there anymore.  I got to, I had to sign the lease last night.  You couldn't drop in for a little bit.  It was, uh, technically only until nine o'clock.  We hung out later, but to make an appearance, say hello, and then you leave and do what you  got to do.  Oh, you might be up a little later doing that, but I think it was, uh, important.  But the guy wasn't going to stay up late for me to sign the lease.  I had to sign the lease at eight o'clock. 
[00:12:00]  That's all right.  Well, now you don't get to hang with Ken.  Now you have your place, your lease is signed, and I think he's calling the boss Ken.  And who's the only one in this studio that's not allowed to call him Ken?  Spass, Spass.  Come on, that's wrong.  All you had to do was show up there, and then you would have broke the ice there.  That was the opportunity you were looking for.  That's the opportunity you were crying about.  You were trying to rig some way where you can go out with Ken and drink a beer. 
[00:12:30]  That ain't going to happen.  These opportunities don't come around every day.  And there was one placed right in front of you last night, and you didn't take advantage  of it.  But Stinky did.  He was right in there.  You got to take advantage, too, because Ant and I met the big, big, big, big, big, big  boss.  Yeah.  The boss that is all over the media today.  Oh, yeah.  We weren't going to tell him we had better things to do.  Better things to do.  Oh, my God.  Were you crazy?  You scooped those opportunities up.  You put everything else aside.  We met him two years ago. 
[00:13:00]  Haven't seen him since, Spass.  Not by our choice.  That's somebody else's decision.  I'm just saying.  I mean.  Out of sight, out of mind.  Right, Oak?  Right.  When's the next chance you're going to be able to hang with Ken?  Hopefully soon.  Could be soon.  Soon.  It ain't happening soon.  He's flying off to Philly, Vegas.  He's not even going to be around for a week now.  He's a huge, huge person in this company.  You have an opportunity of a lifetime that's somebody so big in this company. 
[00:13:30]  Stinky, how long did it take for you to start calling Mr. Stevens Ken last night?  Almost instantaneously.  I was there.  And within ten minutes, he had his arm around my shoulder and we were chatting.  It was like some kind of chemistry there.  We took pictures.  I'll tell you, Spass, wait until you see these pictures.  I don't want to see them.  Of Stinky and his buddy Ken.  And his buddy Ken.  Hanging out.  The boss.  Hanging.  Hanging out.  Drinking beers together.  The pictures are, if you would have just gone into a bar with your friends and hung out 
[00:14:00]  and snapped some pictures, that's how natural it was.  Don't hold it again, Stinky.  I'm not.  He's doing what you should be doing.  I had to sign the lease.  All right.  That's fine.  It's a little more important, I guess.  Your career is not that important.  Get that 14-inch U-Haul back.  Stinky's just a little hungrier than you.  That's all.  That's what it looks like.  I'll tell you that.  That's what it looks like.  Stinky, do you... 
[00:14:30]  Let me ask Stinky something.  Do you even have to be here today?  No, I do not.  Oh, my God.  He works for free and comes in on his days off.  I did that, too, when I was an intern?  He made sure he went and partied with the gang, got to know the boss.  He's doing everything right.  That's not...  I bust my ass.  I'm just saying.  I'm just as hungry as him, if not more.  Steve, what's going on?  Steve.  On the phone line, Steve. 
[00:15:00]  Hello.  Are we going to start this today?  No, no.  Oh, no.  Opie, please relax.  Steve.  Yeah.  All right, there you are.  How are you, bud?  What's going on?  I'm sorry about that.  All right.  So what do you got?  I was like Stinky, myself.  Yeah?  I worked for a guy, one of my bosses.  I was on the job for two weeks.  His father passed away.  Yeah.  I went to the funeral.  I didn't even know the guy, and I went to the funeral.  Look at that.  All right.  After that, I was in like Flynn.  The guy took me out to dinner, to a tiny restaurant. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, I kissed the boss's ass.  I was in.  I worked for three guys for three years, and he treated me like gold.  See?  There you go.  You got to work it, Steve.  You saw the opportunity.  You seized it.  I stood right in.  And it worked out for you.  It worked out for me.  I got a company car out of me.  It's going to come a day you're going to have to go to Ken and ask for maybe more money or something.  He's not even going to know who you are.  You think he's going to be known as the go-getter guy, the guy that's there.  He's Johnny on the spot.  You're going to be excuse guy.  The guy with the excuses as to why you couldn't do this or be here or something. 
[00:16:00]  That's not an excuse.  It was, I had to do this.  Regardless of what the actual facts are, this is how you will be perceived by the boss.  You saw him.  He takes note of it.  He's the boss.  He's like, he looks around.  You might not think he does, but he looks around.  He knows exactly who was there and who wasn't.  Yep.  How did he acknowledge you when he was leaving the studio just now?  He didn't acknowledge me.  There you go.  Did he nod at Stinky on the way out? 
[00:16:30]  He did.  There you go.  A little nod, a little wave.  There you go.  There you go.  Do you have your Boy Scout uniform today?  Yeah, I do.  Where is it?  It's in the back.  I can't wait to see that.  All right, listen.  We have a great show today.  Oh, yeah.  Lots of stories to tell from last night.  We're going to be handing out WoW stickers.  Staten Island.  We finally made it to Staten Island.  The radio show going to Staten Island today.  Earl going to the Staten Island Mall.  Oh, God.  Oh, no. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Did he leave four hours ago?  He left right at two.  That's a little rough to get to.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Earl, call in.  We want to know how close you are to the mall.  One good thing, it is an island.  So when he gets to water, he knows he's got to turn around.  Right.  He can't just keep going.  Oh, God.  Well, this is the first time our show has made it to Staten Island, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's in the way of Earl, but he does have the brand-new WoW stickers he'll be handing out  for a few hours at the Staten Island Mall.  Do we have audio of Earl in the van trying to find the Staten Island Mall? 
[00:17:30]  Oh, here it is.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Oh, Lordy, no.  He's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  That's Earl.  Gets a little freaked out when he has to go find someplace.  All blustered at the wheel trying to find his destination.  Yeah.  All right.  So Staten Island, we're coming today.  Staten Island Mall.  Earl will be there with the WoW van and a ton of WoW stickers.  So we got that going on in Staten Island. 
[00:18:00]  Outside the station today.  Spaz will be dressed in a Boy Scout uniform.  Did we make up the sign yet?  No.  No.  No sign.  Someone's got to make up a sign that says,  Abuse me for five bucks.  All you have to do is show up outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th.  We'll be out there.  Spaz will be in his Boy Scout uniform with a sign.  You hand over your five bucks to Ben,  and you get to say whatever you want to Spaz.  Just berate him.  It's well worth it. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Take out all your aggression on Spaz.  Spaz, could you get dressed in your little Boy Scout uniform?  Yeah.  Let's see how this looks.  We'll do a little photo shoot.  Yeah.  We're going to take a break.  You've got like six or seven minutes to get into that damn Boy Scout uniform,  and we'll talk to you next.  Okay?  There you go, Spaz, to get his little Boy Scout uniform on.  Please join us, 57th and 7th, with your money.  We'll be filming it for the unofficial Opie and Anthony website as well.  Okay?  Okay.  And we've got to take our first break.  We'll be back.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027. 
[00:19:00]  What kind of show is this?  It was like somebody wearing hot wax in your ears until your brain was completely numb.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  The fax line, 212-9579.  6, 3, 9.  We have Steve from the unofficial Opie and Anthony website in the studio.  He's going to be filming Spaz as people yell and scream at him outside the studio today. 
[00:19:30]  57th and 7th will be out there at 4 o'clock.  Absolutely.  And a lot of people got to see the pictures of the pilot that wrote WOW all over Manhattan yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So far, you've got some pretty good pictures of it on the website.  There's some decent ones.  You know, I'm still waiting for someone who might have been directly under it to get, like, a really crisp shot.  Whoever shot the ones that are on there looked like they were maybe in New Jersey or Staten Island maybe because it's, you know, kind of an extreme angle. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  So it's really slight.  You can tell it says WOW.  Oh, absolutely.  One of the W's is definitely fading out, but you can definitely tell that it definitely happened.  I mean, thousands of people were looking up in the sky yesterday.  We pulled off a fast one yesterday, huh?  Must have been really windy up there.  Well, we'll get them on a nice day where the winds aloft aren't that heavy.  Right.  The WOW will last longer.  Right.  But there's some pretty good pictures on foundrymusic.com.  And you had the hot wax pictures from yesterday's show? 
[00:20:30]  It looks like they've been emailed to me.  All right.  I was out all morning in Staten Island, the Bronx, Brooklyn.  Right.  Getting lost.  But once I get home this evening, they will be up on the site.  Very good.  Nice.  Those pictures are pretty, pretty awesome.  Yeah.  To say the least.  I can't wait for you guys to check that out as well.  And that's one of the girls of the girls of O&A, right?  Yeah.  Shannon.  I actually was going to wanted to bring her in here a couple months ago.  And I guess at the time you had just had Annamal on and a couple other people. 
[00:21:00]  And you're like, eh, enough with the porno chicks.  We're always saying no to the porno chicks.  Yeah.  That's a little much.  So I called her.  I said, yeah, you know, maybe now's not a good time.  But I heard her yesterday.  And I was like, eh, Ant got her.  Ant from Top Notch.  Uh-huh.  So that's cool.  And I knew you guys were going to dig her because I've seen she had given me a week-long membership  to her website.  And I saw some of those pictures with her and the other girls.  Yes.  And she'll do anything.  Yeah, I know.  The stuff she was doing for us, we can't even describe on the radio.  Let's just put it this way. 
[00:21:30]  When she was on her belly, she gave us a nice, large target.  Yes.  To pour wax on.  Sure, it was large, too.  Or in, I should say.  Yeah.  It was over.  Over, let's say.  Just over the area.  Large, inviting opening to her.  And are we continuing the Girls of O&A contest on your website?  Oh, absolutely.  We don't really talk about it much, but it's starting to become a pretty cool thing at first.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh.  Ooh.  Yeah, we, actually, Steve started the Girls of O&A. 
[00:22:00]  The girls sent in some, you know, real hot, sexy pictures of themselves.  Ugh.  And at first, it was pretty ugly.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Yeah.  But it seems to be getting better, that whole contest on your website.  It was kind of a livestock show at first, but it got a little better.  Yeah.  So, ladies, if you want to send in your picture, what's up for grabs this month?  Ant from Top Notch has stated that he will supply me with something that is bigger than a bread box  and a hell of a lot more expensive, whatever that entails. 
[00:22:30]  I have no idea.  All right.  But it's been a vacation the last couple times.  The pictures are coming in.  What I'm waiting for is a few consent forms to be sent in, but the pictures are coming in.  So, ladies, please, I encourage you, have someone take some photos of you in a revealing,  but not terribly revealing fashion, and send them off.  Right.  We can get them up on the site.  Okay.  Very good.  Foundrymusic.com.  Steve doing a great job at that website.  Yeah.  We don't get to talk to him often because we're all so freaking busy.  All right.  Where's Spaz? 
[00:23:00]  We've got to check out his Boy Scout uniform.  He should be in it by now.  Is he not on yet?  Brian, what's going on?  Ed, you've got to watch what you say.  Hey, if you say abuse Spaz for five bucks, you're going to have a mob outside trying  to kill him.  No, yeah.  You guys got to be cool.  You can say whatever you want to him, but you can't.  No physical crap, obviously.  Yeah, you got to make sure it's verbal abuse only.  Yeah.  I mean, you guys...  Have a great show, guys.  You guys can be pretty brutal with the verbal, you know, abuse.  So, let's just keep it at that, please.  Or we can't do this. 
[00:23:30]  Let's go to Donna.  Hi, Donna.  What's going on today?  Oh, hi.  I'm just wondering when you guys are coming to Connecticut.  We're going to hit everywhere.  Today is Staten Island.  We're going to be at the Staten Island Mall with the brand new Wow stickers, and hopefully  sometime next week we'll get to Connecticut.  And how far up are you going to go?  Honestly, not too far.  You know, within an hour's commute of the city.  All right.  All right?  All right.  We'll see you then.  All right.  Cool.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, Earl on his way, I guess.  He was supposed to call in. 
[00:24:00]  I'm a little worried, but all right.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up?  I want to hear, man.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Someone gets spazzed.  I'm just wasting time with the phones until he comes walking in here.  Yeah, listen up.  Yeah, go ahead, Frank.  I was up in the Bronx yesterday.  I drive track the trailer, and I was walking down the street, and all the Spanish people  up there, you know, they're pointing up in the air at the Wow, and they didn't know  what it was.  So, I stopped and talked to this guy with his two kids, and I'm telling them what it is, and they  all start cheering and everything.  So, you got some new listeners coming in.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, you guys get your Statue of Liberty's. 
[00:24:30]  We're going to try to get a Wow on the Statue of Liberty.  No, no, no.  I gave them to, what's his name, Psycho Mark over at Mulcahy.  Oh, the Statue of Liberty license plates?  Right.  I know who you are.  Cool, man.  Yeah, do you get them?  No.  I'll get more to you.  All right, Frank.  Later.  Bye.  No, we're trying to get a Wow on the Statue of Liberty.  That would be a huge coup.  And then the ultimate, Wow in space.  Wow in space.  We want one on the spaceship.  Oh, my God.  Yes, fast.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look at you.  You've got to be kidding me. 
[00:25:00]  Look, he actually fits in it.  Wait, let me see.  Do you have the shorts on?  He has.  No, he's only got the long pants.  I can only see from, like, your chest up here.  Shyamalan belt buckle.  All right, so what do you call this uniform?  Private pile.  You look completely pathetic.  What's the arrow thing?  Wait, get on the mic.  Get on the mic.  Spaz has his Boy Scout uniform on.  He's going to be outside soon to get it.  Okay, let me see what your name tag says.  Come here.  Kevin.  Okay, Assistant Scout Master Troop 241. 
[00:25:30]  And then there's a...  You might.  Yeah.  Ranch.  Reniqua.  Reniqua.  The Bronx.  Lodge for New York.  There you go.  You might want to cover up your last name there.  I see you've got a lot of patches on your uniform, Spaz.  Yeah, what do those mean?  What are all the patches?  Help us out here.  Point to them and tell us what they are.  Well, one of them is because I earned the Pali Vudei Award. 
[00:26:00]  The Pali Vudei Award?  I think it's called the Pali Vudei.  Pali Vudei, whatever.  It's a religious award.  It's a religious award.  And what did you have to do to get that award?  I had to do all this religious stuff.  Religious stuff?  It was a long time ago.  I forgot what I had to do.  Stop it!  Writing and stuff.  Okay.  Stop it!  Number one.  What are some of the other patches? 
[00:26:30]  This other patch is for...  I got Light of the Arrow or something like that when I was a Weeblow.  Weeblow.  That should be our promo.  Weeblow.  Stop it!  We're Weeblows.  And the other one, I believe it's because I achieved Eagle Scout.  Wow!  And what about all the patches on your shoulders and stuff?  What's that?  This is my Assistant Scoutmaster patch.  Assistant Scoutmaster?  Yes.  Okay.  You're the assistant to the assistant manager at the movie theater. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  I've earned 22 merit badges, but I can't find those at the moment.  All right.  22 merit badges?  Yes.  Anything...  Wow.  Anything important?  Uh, yeah, like first aid, mammals, environmental science.  Mammals.  How do you win a merit badge in mammals?  That's what you call your dates?  I got that one in three days.  Really?  And what did you have to do to get a mammal thing?  I just had to learn about squirrels and stuff. 
[00:27:30]  I got the basket-weaving merit badge in one day.  I just had to weave a basket.  Basket-weaving?  You learn that at the asylum, don't you?  Spaz, you realize you look completely ridiculous in this uniform.  Was there a day you were proud to put this uniform on?  I still am.  I'm a Boy Scout true and blue, and I have pride when I put this uniform on.  Do you have a Saluted Dictorian badge?  Ben just comes in with the camera.  Come here, jackass.  Everyone is taking pictures of you. 
[00:28:00]  Wow, look at you.  Broad shoulders standing up tall.  He's very proud in that uniform.  You'd think he was a goddamn Marine, the way he's in that uniform.  I even heard the Wilderness Survival Merit badge.  And how did you earn that?  I had to spend one night with just a pocket knife in the wilderness.  In the wilderness of where?  Of the Boy Scout camp.  Of the broads.  Where was the Boy Scout camp?  Yeah.  It's in Kittitinny Mountains.  The Kittitinny Mountains.  Kittitinny Mountains?  The Kittitinny Mountains? 
[00:28:30]  What?  The Kittitinny Mountains.  It's near the dead.  Kittitinny.  Kittitinny?  Kittitinny.  Kittitinny.  Kittitinny.  They want to know if you have a mosquito badge.  Do you have the great mosquito badge right there?  The giant mosquito badge.  No, but you have an insect merit badge.  You have an insect merit badge.  Where's that one?  It's all...  The merit badges are at home.  Yes, of course.  What else do you have on your uniform?  This is...  What's the sash all about? 
[00:29:00]  This is because...  The big arrow sash.  I'm in an elite Boy Scout group called the Order of the Arrow.  Oh, yeah?  The few, the proud, the stupid.  Coming in on instant feedback.  You're part of the elite...  Elite Boy Scouts, yes.  And what do the elite Boy Scouts do?  Okay.  Is there some kind of uprising you guys are called to...  Remember the elite guards?  Sure.  That Saddam Hussein had?  Yeah.  All right.  But they didn't even have matching uniforms?  Yeah.  Thank you, Sam Kittitin.  Go ahead.  There come a special group of scouts called the Order of the Arrow, where there are four 
[00:29:30]  levels up to it.  I believe vigil, brotherhood...  All right, all right.  So you made elite.  Elite.  So what does that entitle you to?  Yeah.  Broads?  What?  What is it?  It's just a special group.  What we do is just attend meetings.  It's special, all right.  And when you walked into, like, a troop and they saw the elite coming, everyone all freaked  out.  Hey!  Wow.  Hey!  No, it's a symbol of authority.  The elite Boy Scouts are here.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's a symbol of authority.  Here they come.  A symbol of authority looking like that?  I was den leader. 
[00:30:00]  I was...  Oh.  I was...  All these types of leaderships and people were under my command.  I...  Were they all retards?  No.  Were they all...  They...  You were commanding people.  I once had command of 25 scouts.  And how old were they?  Uh, they were all, like, uh, 13, 14 years old.  And I was a Cub Scout?  Yeah.  And I thought all scout leaders were gay.  Yes.  Oh, dear.  I gotta be honest.  Because then you got the old, old, like, fathers with the bellies and the shorts.  I was a Boy Scout. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  Woo!  I loved it.  I have my buttocks badge right here.  My young boy buttocks badge.  Oh, dear.  Interesting.  Very interesting.  All right.  Anything else you could tell us about your little outfit there?  Um, no.  What would you command them to do?  Uh, basically, I've been on hundreds of camping trips.  So I would tell them, okay, you're gonna get the firewood. 
[00:31:00]  You're gonna do the cooking.  And you're gonna do the KT duty.  All right.  Dealing out the artists.  And what would happen if they didn't do that?  Would you all just, you know, starve to death?  No, they would be reprimanded.  And did all of their subordinates.  And how would you reprimand one of these little kids?  Oh, yeah.  Pull their little pants down and spank them?  Oh, give them a little spanking.  With a twitch?  Chan that hairless ass.  You put them over your knee and you spank them with a, what is it called?  A switch.  A switch, yes.  A switch.  No, they wouldn't participate in canteen at the end of the night. 
[00:31:30]  Oh.  Well, that's gotta be tragic for them.  Or the campfire.  They wouldn't participate in the skits.  The skits?  Wait, you put on little shows?  I was the emcee of all the skits.  Hey!  How gay does this sound?  10 to 15 skits.  Why don't they allow gay scout leaders?  Because it sounds like the gayest thing.  Little skits around the fire?  Naked?  No, not naked.  I would have little intermissions and stuff, too.  Little intermissions.  Did you roast the marshmallows and all that?  Yes, we did.  Make s'mores? 
[00:32:00]  Yes, we did.  You made s'mores?  Do you have a s'mores badge?  Yes.  And that's about it with your uniform?  That arrow sash is really good.  That's really good.  That's really good.  That's his home up with a capital H.  We have to make sure that it's metal on metal with the belt.  What do you mean?  If we haven't, we get inspection every week during the meetings.  Yeah.  During inspection.  Do they inspect your genitals?  You can't wear white socks.  I'm wearing white socks today.  But you also have to have metal on metal. 
[00:32:30]  If you don't have metal on metal with the belt.  Yeah.  Because then you get written up during inspection.  I'll expect you.  Okay, next.  Inspection.  All right, so are you psyched for today, Spaz?  It's a big day for you.  You're $47,000 in debt.  Yes.  And people will pay $5 to say whatever they want to you.  For how long?  Are you going to be able to hold up?  It depends on you.  If you want to make a lot of money, you should do it for a long time. 
[00:33:00]  If you can't take it, if you're going to run away.  I mean, you're part of the elite Boy Scout.  I think you can take a lot of abuse.  You can take the abuse.  No, but I mean for how long per person?  I think we figured out like 30 seconds or so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can take this.  Someone should get a stopwatch because I know some of our listeners are going to want  to keep going because of that piss that you.  Look, everyone's taking a peek.  Yeah, bring Char in real fast.  Char.  Dear God, is he wearing white socks?  Char.  Yeah, he is.  What do you think of your pal Spaz? 
[00:33:30]  He looks hot.  He looks hot.  A man in uniform.  In a kid's uniform.  And people are already bringing money into the studio.  Thank you, Chuck, from the Radio Chick Show.  Yeah, there we go.  Chuck used to be a part of our show, but now that he's with the Radio Chick, I guess he doesn't  want to talk on our show anymore.  I've never seen a Boy Scout.  I thought they were blue for some reason.  Yeah.  Well, this is the, he's a part of the elite Boy Scouts, Char.  Wow.  Everyone is laughing at you, Spaz. 
[00:34:00]  What do you think?  Let's get his chest off.  I know.  He sticks his chest out to show Char how proud he is of his uniform.  Proud Scout.  You're standing at attention now?  That's what that's called?  At ease.  All right, you're at ease now.  At ease.  Okay.  Paramilitary organization.  That's great.  All right, Spaz.  You're going to be able to take the abuse today, right?  I'm pretty sure I can.  We don't have to worry about you, right?  No, I will not go postal.  Spaz, do you have, is there some kind of pledge or something that you know by heart? 
[00:34:30]  Yes, an oath.  All right, let me hear the Boy Scout oath as done by Spaz.  Let's see if I can remember this.  He puts his three fingers up.  Look, he's doing it.  Get a picture of him doing the oath.  God damn.  Oh, unbelievable.  He's got his three fingers up in the air.  I will do my best to do my duty to guide my country, to obey the Scout law, to help other  people at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.  You failed. 
[00:35:00]  And if you want me to put the sign down, you have to say two.  What?  That's the, uh, two means put the sign down.  I'm out of bums.  So if we don't say that, then you're going to have to keep your hand up the whole time?  What you would do is you would just say signs up, so I'd do that.  Signs up.  Signs up.  And then I can't put it down until you say two.  What does two mean?  It means put it down.  Why?  Why?  That's just the Boy Scout way.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Ponderous.  F-ing Ponderous. 
[00:35:30]  Two.  All right, Spaz.  Hi.  We're ready for you outside.  Four o'clock is when you'll be, uh, leaving the building.  All right.  Who's making the sign?  People are just losing.  You've got to see this freaking uniform.  We've got pictures for the unofficial O.B. and Anthony website.  Hey, Rat, would you get that out of the hamper?  Yeah.  Psychomark, you make the sign.  Psychomark would be very, he'll be very good at making the sign.  Uh, people want to know if you'll be like, uh, you know, helping old ladies cross the  street and stuff.  Oh, we should have them do some good deeds. 
[00:36:00]  Outside the studio.  If anyone has, uh, an old lady friend they, they would like to bring down to the festivities  today at four o'clock outside the station, please do that.  We want Spaz to walk an old lady across the street.  Spaz, what good deeds have you done?  Yeah, any other deeds that we could do?  Do you remember any good deeds that you have done?  I help ladies with packages.  Yeah.  I help family members out a lot.  Yeah.  Because, you know, the two, the slogan is, uh, do good, turn daily.  And the motto is be prepared.  Be prepared.  Be prepared.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  Uh, that'll be so funny if we just have them parade an old lady across the street like  50 times.  Yeah, we need to get you, uh, on film walking an old lady across the street.  You should find a few over there at the Hard Rock or something.  You could just, like, cross the street with old ladies.  Uh, yam bag from over here.  Does Spaz have a merit badge in career suicide yet?  All right, Spaz, we just need the sign and, uh, you're ready to go.  Okay.  I hope a lot of people, uh, come to see you and, uh, pay the five bucks to yell at you. 
[00:37:00]  I don't know, who's going to have the heart to yell at him with, with how he looks, Anthony?  Our listeners, please.  Well-respected uniform.  You want to, like, have, like, a, uh, like a code word?  So we know you've had enough?  Okay.  What's your code word?  Uh, you guys choose it.  Idiot?  Okay.  If you yell idiot, then you've had enough?  Yes.  And we have to get you out of there?  Because it's going to be ugly out there, I'm telling you right now.  Okay.  All right?  Idiot will be the code word. 
[00:37:30]  So when he yells idiot, hit him twice as often.  No hitting?  No, no hitting.  I mean, figuratively speaking.  Right, we have a few, we have a few bodyguards, actually, because we really don't trust you  guys today with Spaz.  Because a lot of people have been pissed at you for many, many months, my friend.  Now, if anyone lays a hand on him, uh, first of all, Steve, unofficial Steve is huge, and  will, like, pummel you.  Yeah, that wouldn't be cool.  No.  It's a fight.  Everybody on the stand.  And Big Kevin's here.  Yes.  Big Kevin will help, uh, help you out, Spaz.  That, he's your friend today. 
[00:38:00]  They're shaking hands.  Thank you.  All right.  Is, uh, Psycho Mark working on the sign?  I believe he won't do it, so Stinky is.  Oh, Stinky's, uh, your, your employee's gonna be writing the, the silly sign for you.  Thank you, Stinky.  All right.  And we gotta take a break.  We're 40 minutes away from, uh, going outside to, to, uh, get people to yell at Spaz, okay?  Yeah.  You gotta come by just to see this stupid, freaking uniform, man.  Yeah, the uniform's really silly.  You should've shaved, though, or something, man.  Yeah, you kinda look like, uh, you know.  I do good.  I don't have no shaving, too. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  Sorry.  You're a goddamn disgrace.  Right.  What's that on your uniform?  A pledge pin?  On your uniform!  I wanna rock!  All right.  We gotta take a break.  We'll be back.

[00:41:00]  If you have something for the show today.  This guy on the line, that was an Eagle Scout with Spaz.  John, what's going on?  Hey, John.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How are you, buddy?  All right.  How's it going?  Good.  Let me tell you something, man.  Spaz is not telling you the truth.  I can't even tell you what we used to do to him.  Oh, you really were an Eagle Scout with Spaz?  Oh, yeah.  What did you used to do to him?  Back in 84. 
[00:41:30]  Let me tell you something, man.  We used to go to camp trips, man.  Uh-huh.  And let me tell you something.  He used to be the biggest fool.  I mean, he's the only person, the only kid that acted serious about it.  Well, he's very serious about it.  We could help by him standing there in his little Eagle Scout uniform that he's very proud to wear the uniform.  Well, let me tell you something, man.  I mean, as a kid growing up, it was like, it was the in thing to do, but he just totally went overboard with it.  Yeah.  Totally.  I mean, you've got to see the way he still acts.  He still knows the words and stuff. 
[00:42:00]  I can't believe it.  Well, Spaz, you want to talk to a fellow Eagle Scout?  Dude, in 84, I was seven years old.  I was barely in Cub Scouts.  It was just joy.  I'd never even been on a camping trip in 84.  I didn't start going on until 86.  84 is when you first started.  Yeah.  I didn't go on any camping trips, dude.  I was just a seven-year-old Cub Scout.  Please, just tell them the truth, Spaz.  A seven-year-old Cub Scout?  That's when it started.  That was your first year.  Well, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'm a year off. 
[00:42:30]  It was, what, 87, 84, and 45.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Spaz doesn't have time for you.  He's walking away.  Okay, whatever, Spaz.  You just got dissed by Spaz.  I'll tell you the last name if you want, Spaz.  No, no, no, no.  Well, thank you, John.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Let's check in with Jeff Norris, friend of the show.  Jeff, what do you have going on today, man?  I hope you're Anthony.  How are we?  Pretty good.  Well, as everyone is as happy as I am that wow season is upon us.  Ah, yes.  And all the wonderful things that everything happens with the station from you guys. 
[00:43:00]  I got a phone call today from a gentleman by the name of Vinnie Brandt, who is the owner  and founder of the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  And he is a big fan of you guys.  He loves, I'm telling you, he said ever since you guys have been plugging guests in the communities  that have been on the show, he wants to do something for O&A listeners tonight.  All right.  And what's that, Jeff?  Well, what it is tonight is Kevin James from King of Queens.  No, no.  Kevin James from King of Queens will be there tonight around with my show. 
[00:43:30]  And any girl who wows, the first girl that wows tonight, gets a special gift.  And if you mention O&A and how much you love him, get free passes for another show.  All right.  Eight o'clock show.  Come on down to Stress Factory.  Kevin James not selling tickets, I guess.  I don't know what the case is.  You guys needed our help to sell tickets for Kevin James, that big TV sitcom star.  Why doesn't he come on our show?  If you guys want him, we can produce him.  We got Otto and George up there.  Um, I saw Kevin James on a few TV shows. 
[00:44:00]  He didn't really...  He's a nice guy and all, but...  No, have fun tonight at the Stress Factory, Jeff.  Thank you, John.  All right, man.  We'll see you soon.  All right, bye.  Bye.  What are you laughing at?  That's a rousing endorsement.  Uh, David, what's going on?  Hey, man, I just want to let you guys know, Black Earl is on Staten Island.  I just passed him on the highway.  You really passed Black Earl?  Yeah.  Is he heading in the right direction for the Staten Island Mall?  He's heading in the right direction.  I'm prepared to guide him if he gets lost. 
[00:44:30]  And how far is he from the Staten Island Mall?  Uh, well, we're stuck in traffic, so I'd say about maybe 15, 20 minutes, maybe.  That means Earl will be late once again.  Yeah.  I will bet anyone that he does not make it to the Staten Island Mall by 4 o'clock.  That's when he's supposed to be there.  I bet he does.  I'll help him.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  I'll make sure he gets there on time.  All right, David.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Earl freaking out in the van, I see you.  Yeah.  Once again. 
[00:45:00]  But if you want the brand new Wow sticker, go to the Staten Island Mall.  Look for the Wow Mobile with Black Earl.  Mm-hmm.  All right, and in about 20 minutes, we're heading outside for the spaz thing.  Yeah.  He's in the Eagle Scout uniform.  We have made the sign, and you've got a chance to say whatever the hell you want to spaz for five bucks.  Yeah.  It should be funny.  Stinky was the one who made the sign, Anthony.  He's holding it in his hand.  It says, insult me for $5.  There you go.  Very good, Stinky.  Thank you.  All right.  We've got to get some good deeds. 
[00:45:30]  I can't wait to see him actually help an old lady across the street.  Yeah, what other deeds can we make him do out there?  Someone's definitely got to produce an old lady for spaz to walk across the street.  Hmm.  Got a couple of rocks he could bang together and make a fire.  Ask spaz if he can make a fire.  If he knows how to make a fire without matches.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Come here.  Yeah.  Spaz, do you know how to make a fire without matches?  Yes, I do.  You do?  Yes, I do.  And you've done this before? 
[00:46:00]  Once.  What do you need to do to make this happen?  A lighter.  It's not matches.  No, you need two rocks and...  All right, well, you just empty your head.  Or anywhere between two to four sticks.  Two to four sticks.  Two to four sticks.  So, I'm going to tell someone to come downstairs with that.  I want to see you try to start a fire.  Start a fire with rocks.  I've got to see this.  You're part of the elite Boy Scouts.  You should be able to start a fire easy.  Easily, right?  Yeah.  You're in the woods with all your tiny little Cub Scouts and you need a warm fire. 
[00:46:30]  You could produce.  Right, Spaz?  It's called the Flint and Stone effect.  The Flintstone effect?  No, the Flint and Stone.  The Flint?  The Flintstone effect.  Okay.  That's right, Barney.  Fake Fred.  Fake Fred, yes.  All right.  Did you also, somebody asked with the arrow thingy out there, do you have an Indian name?  I was given one, yes.  I forgot what it was.  You forgot what your Indian name was? 
[00:47:00]  You forgot your Indian name?  I forgot.  It was given to me during the ceremonial fire.  This is my son, broken rubber.  They give us some silly Indian nickname, but they never tell us what the English version of it is.  It translates to, oh, look at that, Spaz.  That's the Indian version of Spaz.  How are you doing?  Idiot man-child.  Hi.  I wish you would remember your Indian name.  We could call you that.  Me too.  Instead of Spaz.  I should have been with my Boy Scout bag. 
[00:47:30]  It hasn't.  And our listeners on top of the game all the time here, Danielle has done some math.  Okay.  In order for Spaz to earn $47,000, yes, his debt, his debt, he needs to be insulted by 9,400 people.  9,400 people.  Assuming each person gets 30 seconds to insult him, it would take 4,700 minutes to insult him, or about 79 hours straight.  Ah, that ain't going to work, is it? 
[00:48:00]  Every little bit helps.  He'll be out there for quite a while.  What a mess.  One guy who can't make it today wants to use a credit card.  Joel, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Real good.  I can't make it.  I work up in White Plains in Westchester, and I would love to do this.  Can you take a credit card over the phone?  Put up a speaker next to him.  You know, maybe like a surround sound system so it echoes through the streets.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea. 
[00:48:30]  You know, he could polish off the debt real quick.  Yeah, well, we'll see how many people show up outside today at 4.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  So we're only 20, 25 minutes away from that.  The sign's made.  He's in his little uniform.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  And did you hear about the guy that blew his chances on who wants to be a millionaire?  Yeah, this guy's great.  There's a great little story in the Post today, page 14.  This guy, he comes to New York, he qualifies. 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  The night before, he's appearing on who wants to be a millionaire with Regis.  You think he's in his hotel room studying up a little bit?  Studying up, maybe getting a good night's sleep, so he'll be all ready to go to win a million dollars.  Oh, no.  He left his wife home.  Yeah.  Comes to New York by himself.  He's a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire.  He spends the night before the show at scores.  Scores.  Now, where's he from?  It's in the Post.  I don't have the Post in front of me.  One of those, you know, cow towns. 
[00:49:30]  A cow town.  He ends up staying there until like 4 or 5 in the morning.  Blows all his money.  He just says, yeah, a married man from the Midwest.  Right.  Yeah.  Blows all his money, and then he missed one of the easier questions.  Yeah.  He blew his chance.  Missed like right from the start.  Yeah.  In the hot seat.  Yeah.  You can't go singing horse before you chance in the hot seat.  Come on.  Yeah.  Lack of sleep caught up with him. 
[00:50:00]  What is it?  A typical Midwestern rube.  In the big city, he couldn't friggin' handle himself.  Yeah.  You get to New York, and you're just overwhelmed by everything around you.  You know how pissed off this guy's wife is going to be?  Yeah.  Oh.  I blew my chances in a million dollars, but I saw some boobies.  Boobage.  Well, I guess if you're going to be on that show, Scores isn't the place to go.  No, no.  John, what's going on today?  What's up, open head?  How are you?  I'm right in front of a black girl, bro. 
[00:50:30]  Okay.  He's driving like a turtle.  Yeah, he's the slowest driver you will ever see.  He just got off of Victory Boulevard.  He's on his way there.  He'll be there in about five minutes.  All right.  So he's very close to the Staten Island Mall.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Take it easy, guys.  Syndication, whatever.  All right.  We've all driven with Earl, and he's ridiculous.  Yeah.  He drives below the speed limit.  He gets so scared when he's in somebody else's car.  Well, Ann, I know what incident you're going to bring up. 
[00:51:00]  When we went to Goldsbringers.  You had everyone scared that night.  We had to get there.  We needed boobage.  I was driving the wrong way down a one-way street, but my car was facing the right way  because I was backing up the wrong way.  And then there was the sidewalk excursion that we took to get away from the police roadblock.  Yeah.  We made it on time, though, didn't we?  But Earl turned white.  Yeah.  Because of your driving.  Hey, what happened to Psycho Mark last night? 
[00:51:30]  I think we have audio of Earl from that trip.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  He's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  Psycho Mark, we had the staff party last night.  We're all a little bit sluggish today.  We did?  Yeah.  And you almost got arrested after we left you?  I don't want to talk about this.  Ah, yeah.  Get your ass in here.  I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about it.  Because he saw it all.  I was just too drunk.  Oh, Stinky saw it?  Come on over here, Stinky.  Him and the hind from the morning show. 
[00:52:00]  We were getting wrecked.  All right.  So you guys stayed at La Barbet for a while, huh?  That's where our little party.  Actually, we hung out.  Ken and Jeremy hung out longer than anybody.  Yeah.  They were there until the end.  I gave up.  Schmoozing with the bosses.  Yeah.  See, Stinky's buddy Ken.  Dude, these guys are like...  Now, first of all, we've got to thank the staff at La Barbet.  They were absolutely awesome last night.  Always do a great job.  Yes.  We like hanging out there.  All right.  So, Stinky, you guys leave La Barbet.  What did this psychopath do this time? 
[00:52:30]  As we're walking down the street, cop cars.  Well, I walked out with a...  Never mind.  I had a beer in my hand.  Yeah.  You had a beer in your hand.  How the hell do...  Don't you understand you can't leave bars with alcohol?  Yes.  I am an idiot.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  All right.  So, you're walking down the streets of Manhattan with an open beer.  That's only 57th Street.  Not much traffic down there. 
[00:53:00]  Now, you don't really see any cops in our neighborhood.  Snotted.  Snotted.  Snotted.  I love that term.  So, as we're walking down the street, and police cars come, five, four or five police  cars come whizzing down the street, sirens blaring, they're going down the wrong way,  they definitely are in a rush.  Psycho Mark walks out into the first lane with his beer in his hand, waving the cop cars  through, like, come on, come on!  God!  Two cop cars pass, and I'm thinking about pulling over, the drivers are looking at them,  and then, finally, the last one sees them, and they stop, pulled over right away, and... 
[00:53:30]  Right in the middle of 57th.  They cut off the...  Oh, my God.  You guys are...  You guys are...  I'm Psycho Mark!  I'm above the law, you mother effer!  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah!  Stinky, what was he saying?  Because we're hearing rumors, that's the stuff he was saying, right?  Yeah, he was.  He was...  He's playing the Psycho Mark card.  Yeah.  What was I going to do?  He was stealing out of jail.  All right, what was he saying?  You know, you're using up our valuable police favors... 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, cut it out.  ...on stupid stuff.  Now, if you get caught maybe making a left turn where there's a green light and a no left turn sign,  and a cop pulls you over, you play the card, that's legit.  But, I mean, we can't have people drunk in the streets with beer bottles using up our valuable police favors.  So stupid.  So now what happened?  The cops jump out of the car, and it was a female cop, and she...  Hey, nice fun bags.  Let me grab your Kevlar. 
[00:54:30]  Dude, you're out of your mind.  We have to back up the story, because on the way to La Barbat, after the radio show,  what the hell did you say to that chick with the cell phone that was crossing the street with you?  I was walking down the street.  You made me, like, back way up.  Like, we were all walking together.  He starts in with this girl that is obviously on her phone talking to her boyfriend or something,  and he starts in with her, and I, like, just slow way up.  Now I'm, like, 100 feet behind him instead of right behind him.  What was that all about?  Ben was there.  Me and Oprah walking, me and Oprah walking, 
[00:55:00]  and I just hear, you're a loser.  She's yelling at you, you're a loser.  Mark goes, do you know where I live?  I live on the 43rd floor of Tribeca.  And he's going, yeah.  Why did she call you a loser?  I'm walking down the street, minding my own effing business.  You never mind your own effing business now.  I'm walking just, like, happy as a clam.  You're walking down the street.  You're like Anthony Hopkins from Magic.  You can't be quiet if your life depends on it.  Remember that scene where he had to, like, put the puppet down?  Don't let the dummy talk.  Don't let the dummy talk for a few minutes, and he's sweating like a, you know, mother and son. 
[00:55:30]  What are you looking at?  And he finally picks up the puppet and just goes crazy.  You're like that.  You can't keep your mouth shut for one minute.  Somehow I can't see a girl just all of a sudden calling you a loser unless you said something to her.  I started clapping.  You sure, instead of saying you're happy as a clam.  She's on the cell phone.  You guys are crossing the street.  You didn't say something about her clam.  I didn't say anything.  You didn't call her a C-desser?  I just go like this.  I start going, as I'm walking across the street, because I'm pumped.  We're going to drink.  You know, this is great.  So I'm just clapping for joy. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Okay.  She looks over to me, and she goes, that's awfully rude.  And I'm like, oh, really?  So then I start.  Oh, okay.  Now it's coming out.  You're a little nasty.  She's like, go back to the suburbs where you belong.  Oh, okay.  Suburbs?  Me?  You nasty little Jap.  Torture.  That's torture.  Torture.  That's torture. 
[00:56:30]  Let's go back to the suburbs.  Let's go back to the suburbs.  And they called you a loser.  They called me a loser.  And this was before you started drinking.  Inside the bar bath, though, when he's really getting tanked up, he's coming over and going,  I got to go back into the community calendar tonight.  Did you do it?  No.  I almost got arrested.  All right.  So, LeBarbat, afterwards, you're out there with an open beer, like, flagging down cop cars or telling them...  The dumbest thing I ever did.  All right.  So, the cops...  Well, we'll be the judge for that.  So, the cops pop out of the patrol car, Stinky, and then what happened? 
[00:57:00]  What did this idiot do?  I begged for my life.  Yeah, pretty much.  I didn't really stay around because I didn't want to get involved at all.  So, I crossed the street and just watched him stand there.  And he was just talking to the female cop.  And it looked like she wanted a piece of him.  But, yeah, they let him go eventually.  They did.  Now, what did you say to get away?  You did say you were psychomore.  Not really.  I didn't say that.  You know me? 
[00:57:30]  Were you saying, do you know who I am?  No, I didn't even do that.  What did you say?  You had to say something to get away.  I pulled out my only PVA card that I had.  And I used it.  That's good.  Great.  You're drunk.  You're in the middle of the road with a beer bottle.  But I got a PVA card!  And I forgot the cop's name in the back of it.  She's like, you don't remember the name?  And I'm like, I can't!  I'm sorry!  I'm Georgia!  It's Georgia!  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  You remember this name?  Oh, you're going to jail.  And I'm going, oh, no! 
[00:58:00]  I know the name!  People study the names on your PVA card.  Very important.  It looks really bad when you pull it out and you don't know who the hell gave it to you.  Check it out!  Everyone's checking out their PVA card show.  It looks really stupid when you hand it to them and you go, oh, who gave you this?  I don't know, but I'm really good friends with them.  They were so mad at me.  They were so mad at me.  You know, for just being a complete asshole.  You guys, like, you're a bad team, man.  Using the get-out-of-jail-free cards for really silly things.  That's why I felt so dumb. 
[00:58:30]  I'm like, I am on the ground.  Yeah, but he doesn't drive, so this is the equivalent.  Thank God.  This is the equivalent of you getting, you know, pulled over or something, you know?  Maybe.  You've just seen how white I made earlier.  But every time, every time Psycho Market Stinky hang out, there are cops involved lately.  Yeah, I know.  Dude, I don't know what happens.  It's just, it's a coincidence.  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid over there.  Torture!  Torture!  Torture!  It's torture!  All right.  Enough of that.  Enough of that is right.  My brother Joe, stop on. 
[00:59:00]  Hey!  Hey, Joey.  What's up?  What did you bring this picture for?  I think, Steve's going to put it up on the side of it.  What is a picture of you and Aunt?  Yeah.  Look at my hair, dude.  You used to have blonde hair?  Totally blonde hair.  Get out of here.  I swear to God.  Fair hair boy.  No, I bleached it back when I was fall four.  I don't even know how old I am.  You had to see a mosh.  That's pretty funny.  I was thinking that Grandpa's bungalow in Mastic. 
[00:59:30]  Was it?  Yeah.  Hey, they put us in a little cage.  That's great.  And look at how Mom dressed us.  I know.  That was always embarrassing.  She wondered why we dressed like slobs when we were finally able to dress ourselves.  Because look at what you did to us.  Dressing me like a business executive at five.  Got to close that big Pablum deal.  All right.  I'm hearing rumors, Joe.  You might have a spaz song on you.  Oh, yeah.  I think I have what could be the theme to the spaz-a-thon.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Possibly.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll play Joe's brand new spaz song. 
[01:00:00]  Joe always comes up with some great stuff for the show.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And a spaz is heading out of the building in about 10, 12 minutes to get verbally abused  out on the streets of New York.  He's in his Eagle Scout uniform.  Joe, did you check out spaz?  Yes, I did.  When I was his age, when he was doing the scout stuff, I was jumping out of airplanes.  There you go.  I'll have you do that.  I guess Paul is outside the building.  Paul, what's going on?  Yeah.  Oh, hey, man.  You got a crowd out here.  Oh, good. 
[01:00:30]  Come on down.  I got $20 worth of yelling to do.  Boom.  You got $20 to yell at spaz?  That's two minutes.  Now we have to do something.  Hey, you cut me off so many times that I've tried to call me and touch you guys.  I got a lot of yelling at you.  Oh, this is great.  This is your opportunity to get back at spaz, so.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  Thank you, Paul.  You may have to do more math, because if people donate more than $5 a head, it's not going  to be 97,000 people before he has enough money to pay off his debt.  Yeah, but it's going to be the same amount of time.  Oh, okay.  Maybe we should.  Right, okay. 
[01:01:00]  Maybe we should have multi-yelling, where just like four or five guys just like.  A gang yelling.  A gang yelling.  Oh, very degrading.  A gang yelling.  They all pay five bucks, and they circle them and just go off.  Eagle Scout, Cancerous Live Wires, Mets Fan.  There's just an array of things.  A bevy.  Everybody that tried to get through that he cut off.  His dopey education.  Iona College.  Yeah, I think all the Iona graduates should show up outside the building today to get 
[01:01:30]  back in spaz.  I don't think the kids.  Giving your school a bad name.  I don't think the kid's going to make it, man.  I think your brother's all right.  It's going to be rough.  All right, 57th and 7th.  We'll be out there very, very soon.  Let's take a break.  I've got to take a leak.  Let's take a break.  We'll play Joe's spaz song next.  Stay there.  Opie.  You scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such demonic little bastards?  1-0-7-4-W-N-E-W.  Oh, boy. 
[01:02:00]  Never a boring day on the Opie and Anthony show.  A bunch of things happening.  A lot of people gathering outside the station.  57th and 7th.  Two-inch salt spaz for five bucks.  We're going to go downstairs in a few minutes.  Joe, Anthony's brother, has come up with a couple of great little ditties that we're  going to play in a minute or two here.  And Earl, as we speak, is at the Staten Island Mall, Anthony, to hand out the brand new Whip-Em-Out  Wednesday bumper stickers.  Is he really there?  A hot commodity. 
[01:02:30]  Yes, he is.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  The funny thing is, Anthony, that is actual audio of Earl because he's in a little trouble  right now.  What's the matter?  There's cops all over the place.  There's, I guess, a big problem with the Staten Island Mall.  What's the problem?  So you guys beg us to go to Staten Island.  We finally go there, and it doesn't seem like we're being welcomed.  Let's go to the phones and see if we can get to the bottom of this. 
[01:03:00]  First of all, Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, there's about maybe 100, 150 people, cars all over the place, two, three cop cars.  They made a move because he was blocking traffic.  Oh, boy.  They're complaining.  Staten Island cops in the 122, New York's finest.  All right.  So it's a little messy down there at the Staten Island Mall.  Yeah, they're making a move to a quieter spot so we don't interrupt the mall.  All right.  We're just giving out some stickers real quick.  All right.  They don't have a bit of humor. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Your phone's breaking up.  Let's go to another Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on all of a sudden?  How are you?  Yeah, good.  You're our reporter on the scene.  Who's the guy sitting up with the white shirt and the tie?  Don't he got some authority to break these cops' balls or what?  They got nothing else better to do out here.  So what's going on?  You're our reporter on the scene.  I'm blocked in by three cops' cars, and they got a potty wagon out here.  Our listeners don't.  I got nowhere to go.  Don't riot.  They riot.  What?  People are cursing.  This cop.  People can't get by.  He's blocking traffic. 
[01:04:00]  He don't know what to do, and now he's moving.  There's cops all over the place.  Yeah.  They got a potty wagon out here.  There's the police van, police cars, the sergeant's out here with the white shirt.  I think that's standard procedure when a black person goes into Staten Island.  Hey, listen, Staten Island sucks.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  We finally make it to Staten Island, and look at how we're being treated.  Oh, come on.  We're just giving out some stickers, man.  Loosen up.  Hey, Fred, what's going on?  These guys are just busting the balls.  You should have had them go to Highland Boulevard.  Who is it?  Well, we might have to figure out a brand-new location, because it looks like we're not welcome 
[01:04:30]  at the Staten Island Mall.  He would have got there on time if he would have went to Hooters.  It's right over the Barrazzano Bridge.  All right, Fred.  All right.  Thank you.  Anthony, on the line, Black Earl.  All right.  In the middle of controversy once again, Earl.  Hey.  What's going on, Earl?  What's happening?  You tell us.  Well, we just got chased by the cops.  We were greeted by some of New York's 200 people at New York's finest.  Uh-huh.  The mass security. 
[01:05:00]  They're insinuating that it's private property.  I'll try 9X.  And now we're going to be behind 9X in a few minutes, but we've got this huge caravan of  people just waiting for us.  All right.  Cool.  So they're making you move?  Yeah, we're going to be right behind the shopping center.  Okay.  We've got a huge cast of people right behind us.  Are the cops being cool or what?  The cops are being cool.  The mall guys were a little, they weren't happy.  Why aren't the mall guys happy?  We're bringing a ton of people to their mall today. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, they're moving us behind the pergament, which is about, it's where we are.  It's about 500 feet from the mall.  500 feet from the mall.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  The pergament is right next to the Toys R.S. and Kids R.S.  All right.  Well, show your support if you're in the area.  Stop by and get your WOW sticker from Black Earl, okay?  Behind the pergament.  People coming out of the woodwork.  They're coming out of the woodwork?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't think I'm wrong, but last time you guys were at a mall, didn't you bring a bunch  of homeless people? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but this time it's stickers, and you're having like 10 times a little trouble.  A little problems, yeah.  Yeah.  Anything else, Earl?  We'll be around about two minutes, and people are literally running behind us in the van.  All right.  Hold on a second.  We're going to keep you on hold.  Why does Earl still have the crappy phone?  I don't know.  From yesterday?  I don't know.  Can we learn and maybe get him another phone?  And you work here.  We don't learn.  Yeah, I know.  We just don't learn here.  Sal, what's up?  Yeah, O&A.  Listen, man.  Look at this guy.  He's a listener.  He probably doesn't even make much money, but listen to how great his cell phone sounds. 
[01:06:30]  You know, you know...  Hold on.  Hold on, Sal.  Say hi to everyone in the tri-state area.  Say hi to everyone in the tri-state area?  Yeah, I'm just going to prove a little point.  Okay.  Prove a little point.  This is great old Nextel at work.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now let's talk to Earl on our radio station cell phone.  In the same place.  Earl, what's up?  In the same place.  How are you, Earl?  I mean, I'm right.  We're just standing for the parking lot.  They're calling from the same place. 
[01:07:00]  Same place.  We've got to eat his ice cream stuff.  Earl sounds like crap.  He's making deliveries.  Right.  Day after day, we send Earl out.  You'd think someone around here would get the hint and realize, wait, we might have a problem  with the cell phone we use.  All right.  Let's go to one of our listeners.  You're on the air.  Hi.  How are you?  Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm calling from next to Earl.  All right.  So, Sal, what's going on?  Yeah, listen.  I'm getting ready to get out of my car, man. 
[01:07:30]  And I'll tell you, the cops are cool.  They're not bad.  It's just that Earl pulled up right dead smack in front of the whole stinking place.  And, of course, man, they have to move.  You know, we all have to move.  Now we're all here.  Big eating.  Truck is out here.  We've got loads of people, and it's kind of cool.  You guys rock, man.  Let me tell you.  Thank you, Sal.  Okay, guys.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  So, get your wow sticker, brand new wow sticker, sweeping the area.  Well, let's go to Vinny, the Staten Island cop.  He's saying it's not their fault. 
[01:08:00]  Vinny, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, listen.  I'm sitting here.  I'm listening to that.  All these people bash the cops.  You know, we've got a job to do just like everybody else.  Wait, you're a cop, Vinny?  Yes, I am.  You sound like you're, like, 15, man.  No.  Dude, I'm 27.  Okay.  Let me tell you, I was up at the studio trying to grab wow stickers, and that black broad wouldn't let me in.  That black broad.  I think you're at the wrong station.  I don't even know if we have any black broads that work up there.  At the desk.  Okay.  So you're a Staten Island cop.  What is the problem down there?  I'm not here. 
[01:08:30]  I'm just saying, you know, people got to lighten up on the cops.  You know, you got a lot of fans out here.  No, we know, man.  Yeah.  No.  All right, man.  That was my one gripe.  I didn't want everybody to think, you know.  No, the mall calls the cops.  They got to go and do their thing.  That's cool.  All right.  We understand that.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Syndication on the ground.  All right.  It's happening as we speak.  Growing every day, that's syndication on the ground.  Absolutely.  You just got nowhere to look.  I've heard from people all over the country.  Opie, brand new people coming in from Chicago.  Another person from Tennessee, now on the underground. 
[01:09:00]  And there was one more state.  New Mexico.  New Mexico.  Yep.  It's the Opie and Anthony Underground Syndication Railroad.  Yeah.  One at a time.  One at a time.  That's okay.  So, Earl.  You.  All right.  Rumor has it that you just kind of pulled up in front of the whole damn place and caused  a major scene.  I pulled up in front of the city.  You've got to be kidding me.  There was an easy, an easy, a huge truck with a big wall sign on it. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  Earl, how many people are around you right now with a cell phone trying to call the radio  station?  It's going to come out because we're handing out stickers on a radio show sale.  We've got a few people out here.  All right, Earl.  That is the worst phone, Earl.  Yeah.  Earl.  You forget who I work for.  All right.  Earl, listen.  Call us back soon, okay?  Yes.  Are you situated now? 
[01:10:00]  We're in the parking lot right in front of the program and we're in our wall stickers  as we speak.  All right.  And it's right down the street from the Staten Island Mall.  Right across from the Staten Island Mall.  You can't miss it.  It's a big program.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  Bye.  Bye.  Earl is still using the same phone Canon used.  Remember in the old episodes of Canon when he used to have to pick up the phone from the  middle from the hump in the car and it still had the curly wire just going into the gear  shift somewhere?  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Mobile operator.  Mobile operator.  Get me 555.  Mobile operator.  All right.  A little note to management.  We need a better cell phone.  A show cell phone.  I don't know what else we have to do to prove that to you, but we need a cell phone that  works if we're going to be out and about every day.  Earl phoning in from the moon.  Blatant racism coming in as to why the phone isn't working.  I can't even repeat that here.  All right.  Let's play one of Joe's songs.  Which one do you want to play?  Where's the CD, Joe?  Got it right here.  What do you got?  You did something about the Ben Stein situation that we had? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's start with that one.  I want to hear that.  Okay.  Sure.  Joe, we did a little takeoff on the Ben Stein program, win Ben Stein's money.  Yeah.  You know, we had a problem with Ben like a week ago, just under a week ago.  He called up.  We were going to talk to him, plug his new show, do him a favor.  And he thought I said Jew down the price of a car when I actually said Chew down the price.  Freaked out and hung up on the show thinking that he even knew I said Chew. 
[01:11:30]  What a Jew.  Oh, my God.  He even knew I said Chew, but it sounded too much like Jew, and he freaked out.  The man obviously has some issues, but I guess Joe did a takeoff on his show.  Yes, I did.  And what is it called?  It's called Win Ben Stein's Approval.  Joe's doing a pretty good Ben Stein impression on this.  Well, thank you.  I do feel like Gallagher Jr.  Gallagher, too. 
[01:12:00]  I'll give it a shot.  All right.  Let's check it out.  It's Anthony's brother, Joe, everyone.  Hello, and welcome to Win Ben Stein's Approval.  I'm your host, Ben Stein.  This is the show where varied mutants of bastard ethnicity try to win my approval.  Our first contestant is from Chinatown.  So please give a warm welcome for Wang Nohang. 
[01:12:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. Stein.  Now, Wang, your first question is, what was the name of the Wookiee in the motion picture Star Wars?  Oh, that's easy, Mr. Stein.  That's easy.  That would be a Chewbacca.  Oh, Chewbacca, huh?  No.  You've insulted my people.  Now get out of my studio.  You rice-packing, slanty-eyed, goop-slope-faced, yellow-chinky bastard. 
[01:13:00]  Security, have this man removed.  No, no, no, no, no.  Our next contestant to try to win my approval is from Compton, California.  Please welcome Dick Black.  Why, thank you all, Mr. Stein.  It's going to be a pleasure to be here.  Okay, Dick, your first question is, what article of clothing is used to cover your feet? 
[01:13:30]  Oh, that's easy, Mr. Stein.  Them's would be shoes.  Excuse me.  Yes, sir?  Did I just hear you say Jews?  Oh, no, no, Lordy no, Mr. Stein.  I swear, I said shoes.  I don't believe you, you spade, jungle bun, jigger jigger boo, coon, man, I'll pick a new porch,  and vehicle town, shit, and flying, spear chucker, security, have this man be.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:14:00]  Sorry, that's all the time we have for today.  See you next time when some mutant subhuman mongrel bastards try to win Ben Stein the Blue Bowl.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Very funny.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow, the review's coming in.  We have to go to the polls real fast.  Joe loved the bit.  Hey, Joe, what's going on? 
[01:14:30]  This bit is fab-julis.  Well, listen, before you got with Spaz, I know a lot of people might be cursing.  Screw ain't talking about love.  Cue up the whole damn Van Halen city.  Yeah.  I guess the deal is if we're going to try to get some of this on the radio today, you guys can't curse.  You've got to help us out with that.  You can say anything you want, but just don't curse, right?  Obviously.  Hey, Steve there.  Yeah, from Foundry?  Yeah, this is Joe Sopron.  I got a message.  What's up, Joe?  When the music stops, it's time for the news.  Oh, shut up. 
[01:15:00]  Is that from your little radio show?  Shut up.  It's bad enough.  I have to play it.  Every time I'm pulling all night or I listen to you in the morning, man, you're the best.  Oh, God.  Yeah, our own Steve from foundrymusic.com is breaking into the radio business.  Yeah.  Doing very well.  Cool.  I've got to go on the air and say he does very well.  Yeah, he does have a good radio voice.  When the music stops, it's time for the news?  Yeah, that's the slug line?  That's the slug line right before the AP hits at the top of the hour.  Yeah, that's hilarious. 
[01:15:30]  The first radio station I worked at, the slug line was, hit music and more.  That was way upstate, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was.  Yeah, up in New Orleans.  I will bring in my tapes from my first radio job.  It's brutal.  It's brutal.  All right.  The Genesee Valley forecast for Saturday.  Here's your official North Jersey weather.  All right, Joe.  We'll talk to you soon, man.  All right, man.  Bye.  Good job on the website, by the way.  Does a lot for it as well.  Yes, he does. 
[01:16:00]  Bernie, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to nominate Ben Stein's approval.  Not for bid of the week, bid of the year.  Yeah, all right.  Play it again.  Thank you.  We'll play it again, definitely, later on.  All right, cool.  Joe also brought in a spaz song that we're going to do in a few minutes.  Speaking of which, I guess we've got to get spaz outside to get abused.  Do we have the crew?  Steve, open that door.  Who's going down there?  Steve's going down there.  Stinky, you're going down with spaz for a little while? 
[01:16:30]  I don't think so.  I think I'll have to stay up here.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to handle the phones.  Ben, you're going down.  Big Kev's going down.  Psycho Mark's going down.  Where's the man of the hour in his Eagle Scout uniform?  He's on the phone.  Where?  Over there?  Yeah, he's on the Eagle Scout.  Well, get him in here.  How'd you like to roll my lawn?  All right, there he is, everyone.  Spaz.  Put his chest out.  Put his chest out.  He's all proud.  All right.  Who's got a cell phone that works?  I do.  How'd you like to roll my lawn?  Huh?  How about you guys get the festivities going?  Ed and I will come out in a little while. 
[01:17:00]  We still have some stuff to do on the radio.  But we'll get a lot of this on the radio, okay?  We'll throw a microphone out the window.  We should.  But, all right.  So, Psycho Mark, get on the cell phone and get the festivities going.  We've got the sign and everything.  If you want to make fun of spaz, it'll cost you five bucks.  Just get to 57th and 7th.  We'll be out there in minutes.  There's a bunch of people out there ready, so.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  The next time we talk, we'll be on the phone with Psycho Mark as he's outside the building  with Spaz for his big day, Anthony. 
[01:17:30]  Spaz, you're going to be okay, right?  He's holding that damn sign, man.  Insult me for five dollars.  Steve is taming them.  I know.  That is too funny.  Isn't it hilarious?  Insult me for five dollars.  And if you don't want to spend the five bucks, you don't have to.  Just come down and check it out for yourself, because it's really funny what he looks like.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  There you go.  Spaz, everyone.  We'll talk to Psycho Mark next.  What other radio show is going to give you, like, intelligence talk about stocks and girls 
[01:18:00]  playing What's In My Pants?  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  It's the ONA Show.  212-757-1027.  Earl's calling back from the Staten Island Mall, Anthony.  On his horrible cell phone.  Absolutely horrible cell phone.  Earl's calling back from Jupiter.  Hey, Earl.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  We're in the parking lot.  We're out of the Staten Island.  All right.  Listen.  It's moving over. 
[01:18:30]  It's moving over.  I know we have a lot of faithful listeners around Earl right now with cell phones.  Could one of you guys please give us a call so we can hear what the hell's going on in there.  Thank you.  Earl, where are you?  Right in front of Pargament, which is right across the street from the Staten Island Mall.  And a lot of people showing up for their wow stickers?  They're coming out of the woodwork.  This parking lot was empty five minutes ago.  It's showing up pretty quick.  They're just flying out of every direction.  Earl, you're like Magellan for the ONA Show. 
[01:19:00]  This is the first time we've made it to Staten Island.  I'm standing.  See, he can't even hear me.  He can't hear me.  The phone sucks.  The phone blows.  All right, Earl.  Pergament.  There's no girls here.  No girls.  Well, all right.  Girls, show up and flash your little boobies to the crowd.  Across the street from the Staten Island Mall at Pergament, right?  Right in front of Pergament.  We're on behalf of that another 15, 20 minutes.  Why only that?  Probably as long as the stickers are left.  The stickers are flying fast. 
[01:19:30]  We're running out of stickers.  Wow, okay.  All right, get there soon, then.  Thank you, Earl.  I'm going to bet.  All right, bye.  There he goes.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, Salamia.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, Salamia.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm over here now. 
[01:20:00]  I'm over here now.  Hey, Psycho Mark, where are you?  I'm over here now.  I'm outside the building.  Help me, help me.  All right, Psycho Mark.  Oh, boy.  All right.  There's a couple of people downstairs.  There's about 50 people out here right now already in line.  All right.  Yeah, we're outside the building now.  Ant's going down there in a little while.  We're going to take ships.  57th and 7th, you've got a chance to yell and scream at Spaz.  All you have to do is pay five bucks. 
[01:20:30]  So, Psycho Mark.  Yeah, we've got the first guy lined up.  He's ready to go.  What's your name?  Wait, wait, wait.  Anthony.  All right, yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, well, you've got to give us the scene.  What's going on?  Everyone lining up.  Spaz is there.  There's about 50 people here standing in front of the Brooklyn Diner.  Everyone's very happy.  They're more than willing to yell at Spaz.  All right, first of all, who's collecting the money?  Ben's collecting the money.  Ben's collecting the money.  I'm just trying to get this visual in my head.  So, there's a line.  Ben's collecting the money.  Spaz is there in his Eagle Scout uniform and the sign that says,  insult me for five dollars. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, and he's standing right here on the stairs.  We've got Big Kev standing next to him in case anyone gets out of line.  Okay.  We've got Steve from the website.  He's videotaping everything.  Okay.  And we've got our first contestant, Anthony, here.  He's going to...  All right, before you start this, we've got to talk to Spaz really fast.  All right, hold on.  Here's Spaz.  I just want to make sure he's going to be okay with this.  Condemned man.  Hello?  Spaz?  Yes?  Are people laughing at you out there?  Yeah, and they're also trying to get free insults in.  They're trying to get free insults in. 
[01:21:30]  Dude, remember the time you hung up on me?  Yeah.  Oh, that's just starting with that.  All right, listen, listen, guys.  We appreciate the humor, but no free insults today.  No.  There's enough people that are willing to pay today.  I've never seen a longer line.  Is the line just getting longer and longer, Spaz?  It's getting longer and longer.  People are seeing the sign, and they're just getting on line.  All right, very good.  Well, give the phone back to Psycho Mark.  Mark.  People are beeping.  All right, guys.  Now, Mark, make sure you tell these people not to curse.  Yeah, I told them, no cursing. 
[01:22:00]  Try and keep it clean.  But, you know, if you're going to curse, use an abbreviation like F or C.  Yeah, and did you guys bring wow stickers down there?  We've got tons of wow stickers, so if anyone needs a wow sticker, bye.  We've got tons of them here.  All right.  We're all ready to go.  All right.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  All right, go ahead, Anthony.  Take it away.  Spaz, I hate you for the hell.  I'm ashamed to be a M.S. fan because of you.  I hope, I hope you have like freaking urine rains on your head all day. 
[01:22:30]  You're going to go to hell.  Everybody knows it.  Because they hate you.  They hate you because they want to see you die.  They want to piss on your grave like the urine falls on your head every day.  I hope you spend a nice day.  And.  There it is.  The first value of insults have been thrown out.  Spaz has made five bucks so far.  Uh, Mark.  Yeah.  Uh, are you just holding the phone at a distance a little bit?  Yeah, hold the sound, okay?  Yeah, don't, don't let the, uh, the person scream into the phone because we'll be able 
[01:23:00]  to hear even more.  $46,995 bucks left to go.  There we go.  All right, who's next?  Hey, who, what's your name?  Right.  Yeah, next.  And, uh, Ray, where are you from?  He's from Jersey and he's ready to give Spaz a licking here.  All right.  All right.  Look at this guy with a big wild sign on him.  That's just beeping down 57. 
[01:23:30]  That's awesome.  All right, Fred, are you ready with the stopwatch?  All right, go ahead.  Go.  Go.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Darn.  You ain't college.  I don't see it.  You go to college and you don't do nothing.  Die.  That's it.  That's it.  That was a quick, uh, quick hit.  That was a quick hit.  All right.  There's people driving by and yelling from their vehicles.  They're driving through their windows.  All right, rocks.  All right, who's the next contestant?  Sal.  Sal. 
[01:24:00]  This guy, Sal.  He's up next.  Die.  Ben, ready with the watch?  Jake.  Go ahead.  You're a stupid, you're a stupid retard.  Know that?  You're a stupid retard.  You know that?  You're so stupid brainless.  That's what you fucking are.  Excuse me.  Sorry.  Oh, they're cursing.  Oh, my God.  That guy, she cursed a couple times.  That's all right.  Does he have a few seconds left?  You're a stupid retard.  All right, there they go.  I was like, meet anybody else around here.  You're a retard.  That's it. 
[01:24:30]  There it is, time.  Retard.  No cursing, everybody.  Please, keep it clean.  Yeah, Psycho Mark, how many people are online now?  There has got to be at least a hundred now.  There you go.  It's insane.  We're going to make a lot of money today, boys.  Helping out Sparrow.  All right, Joe, where are you from?  Joe's from Queens.  He's up next, Ben.  Are you ready?  Ready?  Okay.  It's Philbin.  See it?  Regis Philbin.  You friggin' moron.  It's Philbin.  You're just... 
[01:25:00]  You're going to hit me every day.  It's Philbin, you idiot.  That's it.  That's it.  That was all, Ben.  What was Sparrow calling Regis Philbin?  Regis Philbin.  Philbin.  Regis Philbin.  What happened, Psycho Mark?  This guy just gave a fast 40 bucks to yell at him.  Oh, my God.  This should be good.  He wants a fast plug.  What do you want a plug?  Hell blows a shallower to go out magazine in Hoboken, ready? 
[01:25:30]  All right, man.  All right, go ahead, Ben.  You ready with the watch?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Sparrow, I had the unfortunate opportunity to interview you today, and it's sickening how  poor your life is right now.  You're lost.  Lost.  I want you to take that 40 bucks.  I want you to get some self-help books.  You're going to read them if you can.  If your girlfriend, she's dying in front of that.  I'm coming back.  I'm kicking your ass.  If the concierge of St. Regis, she's dying in front of that.  I'm coming back, and I'm kicking your ass. 
[01:26:00]  You need some help, brother.  Stop wetting your pants.  Here we go.  All right, let me...  Wait a minute.  You know what we ought to do?  I don't think Spaz is looking pathetic enough for the listeners.  If someone could go into the Brooklyn Diner and get a cup full of water and pour it on  his groin like he wet himself.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  That is a very good idea.  Hey, can someone run into the Brooklyn Diner and grab a cup of water?  He's got to look like he beat himself.  I think he should have a blindfold and a butt hanging out of his mouth, too. 
[01:26:30]  Who's going to pour the water on him?  Just splash it on his lap.  Yeah, okay.  All right, let's talk to Spaz.  Let's see how he's doing so far.  All right, hold on.  Spaz, hey.  Hello?  Spaz?  Hey, Spaz.  You holding up so far?  That last one was kind of brutal.  The last one got to you a little bit?  Yeah, the wedding of the pants.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, that'll be fun.  It'll cool you down.  I have a professional wrestler in front of me now.  A professional wrestler's in front of you?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:27:00]  And you look pretty big.  The cop just insulted me driving by.  The cops are getting in on it.  There you go.  All right, give the phone back to Psycho Mark.  Mark.  Yeah.  Hey, Mark.  What's up?  Your phone's a little crappy, I've got to admit.  Is it crapping on?  A little bit.  Yeah.  Maybe you could get a better, move around a little bit.  All right.  Let me see.  How's this?  A little better?  Yeah, it sounds a little better.  Reports coming in, Earl is giving out 25 stickers at a time.  Yeah.  Psycho Mark, hold on one second. 
[01:27:30]  Hold on.  We have two stories breaking here today on the Opie and Anthony's program.  We're all over the place.  We're in Staten Island, and we're right outside the building.  TJ's out at Staten Island at Pergament.  What's going on, TJ?  Yo, man.  I just got like 25 stickers from Black Earl.  He's just handing them out like water.  That's why he's leaving in like 10 minutes.  Terrible.  There's no business.  Wonderful.  All right.  No, who's that fat guy with the tie with him?  I don't know.  I don't know who he brought.  Oh, he's in the van with him.  Oh, really? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, I don't know who he was.  Probably someone from the mall or from Pergament.  We sent Earl by himself today.  All right?  Is that?  All right, man.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Earl handing out 25 stickers at a time.  That's good.  All right.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  All right.  Does that sound good?  Yeah.  Yeah, that sounds a little better.  We've got the Metal Maniac here.  He just got off the plane from Hawaii to yell at Spaz.  All right, brother.  What's up?  All right.  Are you ready, Ben, with the watch?  He's got a minute.  He's got a full minute, this guy.  He's going to use a whole minute.  He's not even going to use a whole minute? 
[01:28:30]  Much material.  All right, you ready?  Here we go.  That's right, you pencil necks.  It's the Metal Maniac.  I'm going to have the king of pencil necks standing in front of me.  What's his name?  Man.  Spaz.  Oh, that's right.  I almost forgot from JFK to hear Spaz.  Sir, how did you go from $5,000 last week with the hotel?  Now you've got $47,000.  I want to hear the bit where they're telling them with the $200 boots.  The $200 boots.  Brother, you know when the Rock about your pronies?  He was talking about you. 
[01:29:00]  Get it right?  Did somebody get this?  He needs to eat.  It's the cash meeting.  People drop a quarter.  As long as he's paying.  Yeah, as long as he's paying.  We don't care.  Is there how many trains you're taking?  And by the way, get ready to have to go for another Sunday, man.  It's the name of the Rock, brother.  There we go.  Oh, what?  Whatever.  You sure he paid?  Yeah.  As long as we got a...  As long as Spaz gets his money.  I can pay again.  He gets the money.  All right, second mark.  I think we've got to take a break. 
[01:29:30]  But you guys definitely continue the festivities.  Keep it going.  We're going to keep it moving.  And we'll check in with you in a few minutes, all right?  Very good.  Psycho Mark outside the building has people abuse Spaz for $5 a pop.  How many people are online right now?  I've got about 100 people standing around here.  Nice.  People walking up.  There's cars coming by.  People yelling out the windows.  Right.  It's insane.  Even cops.  The cops are coming by and yelling through their speakers.  You're an idiot.  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  We got the cup of water, so we'll try and pour it on his nuts. 
[01:30:00]  I think Ed's going down there in a few minutes, too, so...  Yeah, I'll head down.  All right.  Thank you, Psycho Mark.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  There's a guy in an ambulance right now.  He's yelling.  He's yelling through the loudspeaker.  All right, cool.  Continue and we'll talk to you soon, okay?  All right.  There you go, Psycho Mark outside the building.  Having a lot of fun.  Jesus.  Ed, as we go to break, we should play the brand-new Spaz song that your brother Joe did.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  This I'd like you to think of as a theme for the Spaz-a-thon.  Okay.  That's pretty much what it is.  Very funny stuff.  Check it out for yourself.  Whoa!  Who's that moronic red-headed nigger or jazz wife who don't know how to manage his credit?  Damn.  You're so stupid!  You're so stupid!  Whoa! 
[01:31:00]  Whoa!  Who is the man who's in debt for 47 grand?  He's an idiot.  Who's the dick that owes more cash than Anthony Ross when the NASDAQ crashed?  He's broke.  They say this cat Spaz is one dumb mother.  We're talking about Spaz. 
[01:31:30]  He's a dick.  He's a young, retarded man.  Took charge way too much on his visa.  Kevin Spaz.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  That's pretty good.  I like that.  Kevin Spaz.  Kevin Spaz.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back. 
[01:32:00]  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Yeah.  Mother's Day right around the corner, right?  May 14th.  What?  A couple weeks?  A week?  What are we talking about?  Next Sunday.  Thank you, Anthony.  Next Sunday, Mother's Day.  Is it?  Wait a minute.  No, I think you're right.  It's the 4th.  4th.  This Sunday would be the 5th, 6th.  Do the math.  Saturday?  Wait, today's the 4th?  4th. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  5th, 6th.  Week from Sunday's Mother's Day.  Okay.  Very good.  What are you getting for your mother this Mother's Day?  The big question is, does the Vermont Teddy Bear Company deliver to Tahiti?  Oh, is mom in Tahiti?  Yes, she is for Mother's Day.  Oh, cool.  Maybe we'll play that old Mets bit.  Yeah, next Sunday, make mom happy.  Send her a Bear Graham gift from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company. 
[01:33:00]  Fun way to let mom know she's loved and appreciated, Opie.  Yeah.  Hmm?  Your mom or your wife or grandmother will receive a beautiful bear,  handcrafted in Vermont, personalized for her.  That would be interesting.  With a card and candy delivered in a colorful gift box.  I've already sent one to someone, Anthony.  Have you?  Yeah, I send out the Vermont Teddy Bears all the time.  It is a very, very good gift.  And what you did was you called a Bear Counselor at 1-800-829-BEAR.  You discussed with the Bear Counselor a little bit about your loved one. 
[01:33:30]  Mm-hmm.  And they gave you some suggestions on bears that fit their personality.  Correct.  Maybe the angel mom or the mama's boy bear with the heart-shaped mom tattoo.  Tailor a bear to mom's occupation or hobby.  Nurse bear, teacher bear, gardening bear, pregnancy bear, or the red hot mama bear.  I guess you get that one if you're in the trailer park and your mom's a red hot mama.  A red hot mama. 
[01:34:00]  Send a bear, Graham.  Creative alternative to flowers.  And your mom will love the bear forever.  It doesn't just wither away and die.  And dads, it's your job to get a present from mom from the kids.  You know how that is?  Dad takes you to the store and is like, oh, oh, Chanel number five again.  Here it is.  Oh, boy, what a creative gift.  Now, Vermont Teddy Bear.  Now, they pick out the Pokemon cards.  Mom will like the Pokemon card, Dad.  Well, they have a mother and cub set.  Perfect for the kitties.  Give them a call right now.

Give them a call.  1-800-829-BEAR.  Tell them Opie and Anthony sent you.  Nasty.  Ladies and gentlemen, the following statements do not necessarily reflect the opinion of anyone  on his wife's mind.  Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like. 
[01:35:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh!  All right, we're all over the ball field today.  Opie in the studio.  We got Black Girl at the Pergamon in Staten Island, handing out the brand new Wow stickers.  And right outside the building, our buddy, our pal, Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, man?  Oh, hey.  What's the scene out there?  Uh, well, there's a crap load of people right out here, taunting Spaz.  One guy, right before we went live, was standing two inches in front of Spaz's face, yelling, 
[01:35:30]  No, don't stop!  Like, spit was flying out of his mouth into Spaz's face.  He was, like, coughing up a lung.  It was great.  And then Spaz starts taunting the crowd.  Listen to him.  He's going,  Oh, my God.  He goes,  Come on, bunch of Jews, insult me.  Oh, my God.  He's haunting the crowd.  He is at the point of snapping.  Okay, we got another guy, another contender who is just throwing money now for this chance. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, all right.  There he goes.  There he goes, look, Mike.  Oh, my God.  What does he say?  I don't know.  A little Erica abuse going on there.  Oh, no?  He goes, on behalf of Cubans, he gave him crap.  Another guy's stepping up.  Okay.  A young guy.  Looks like he's going to be around in mid-20s.  We'll backpack him walking.  Now, here he goes.  Stupid!  Stupid ass! 
[01:36:30]  Oh, my God!  Where the hell did you come from?  What the hell is wrong with you?  I want to just shave!  You look like a freaking dumb ass idiot!  Oh, my God!  I'm just kidding!  I kicked him!  I got ran away puking.  You ran away puking?  Did you hear him insulting us first? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I did.  Good.  It sounded perfect.  Why don't you take this Rosie out?  This is more like you.  There he goes, Matt.  He put a Rosie O'Donnell show hat on.  He said they're more appropriate to Spaz.  He is getting abused.  People coming up, throwing.  They're so passionate about this.  They are throwing the money at him.  Oh, that's funny.  And then whenever there's a lull in the people that are coming up and giving them money,  like they're pulling out of their pocket, Spaz starts taunting the crowd. 
[01:37:30]  Throwing them mooks and jerkballs.  That racial epithets he's throwing at the crowd.  I can't see him getting out of this alive.  Usually you would think you would just sit there and take it.  Yeah.  He's taunting them.  He's not.  Remember when I said about it to every one of you?  I'll hang up on you routinely and I can think of you doing that, you two bastards!  Did you hear that?  For some reason, he's calling people, you guys, in that Boy Scout uniform, 
[01:38:00]  yelling what he's yelling.  He looks like a Hitler youth.  He looks like a friggin', like a Hitler youth now.  He's yelling racial epithets.  Hey, Anthony, this just in, Ernie from Jersey says,  Hey, Spaz, only 130 insults to go,  and then you can spend a splendid night at the St. Regis.  All right, it sounds like a crazy scene out there.  It's insane.  There's people in the middle of the street.  Yeah.  They're handing out wow stickers.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  And every vehicle that's driving by is honking.  Yeah.  And they all got wow stickers.  Here comes another truck.  Got a Yankees hat on, leaning out, yelling.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  It's insane.  The whole sidewalk is taken off.  Oh, it's hilarious.  There's some poor guy.  It's an art of handwriting.  He's trying to get some money over there about 20 feet away.  Oh, I see that guy every day, yeah.  No one's over by him.  Oh, poor guy.  It's insane.  People are honking. 
[01:39:00]  It's a sick scene out here.  Is anyone stepping up to insult him or what?  Yeah, people have been insulting him.  I think people are throwing in some freebies.  They love to insult him, but they don't want to pay him.  No.  They don't want to pay for another night at the St. Regis.  No, I don't blame him.  And talk to Spaz, see how he's holding up there.  Spaz, Spaz, how are you holding up?  Nobody wants to insult me.  I insult these people on a regular basis, but they don't want to insult me back.  Maybe they just don't want to pay you money.  Yeah, that could be the reason. 
[01:39:30]  One guy was saying, like, just a few more insults, you'll be able to spend another night at the St. Regis.  I'm never going back there again.  I think I'm going to insult these people on a regular basis.  Spaz is going to insult some more people.  Oh, my God.  Dude, 57th Street is a friggin' mess.  Yeah.  People are going crazy.  I insulted him to everyone of you before I insulted you.  I insulted him.  I insulted him.  I insulted him.  I look on you. 
[01:40:00]  I'll call you everything that's looking for somebody calling you.  You never get your 15 minutes of fame on the air.  There's one of those little cop scooters just pulled up.  Uh-oh.  Three-wheel things.  Yeah.  But the cop isn't getting out.  I think he's just watching the festivity.  Oh, he wants to check it out.  Very good.  Dude, it's an insane scene.  Well, the feedback's going crazy.  They want to hear someone make fun of Spaz for five bucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And any more takers on the Spaz or you just want to fire out insults for three?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tell them they're live on the air. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'll be live on the air.  Live on the air.  Five bucks in Spaz.  What does he want to say?  I feel like a carnival barker.  I know.  Well, you know.  Like a friggin' carnival barker here.  All right.  We got a taker.  Here you go.  All right.  He's paying us five bucks.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go.  Everybody, you need your help, all right?  You got voices.  You hear them?  Yeah.  Okay.  When I say loser, you say Spaz. 
[01:41:00]  Loser.  Loser.  When I say Spaz, you say idiot.  Spaz.  Spaz.  When I say racist, you say Spaz.  Spaz.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:41:30]  He got his five dollars' worth.  He sure did.  The cars are passing by.  They're yelling out.  They're laughing.  Traffic enforcement.  Awesome.  And I'm going to put you on hold for one second.  I'll be right back.  Okay.  Hold on.  It's just getting crazy around here.  Barbara, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  How are you doing?  Great.  You want to wow everyone on 57th?  Yes, I did.  I was on my way up there, but I don't know because the whole place is probably like mobbed. 
[01:42:00]  Well, there's a lot of people down there, yeah.  Yeah.  If you're in a car, just drive by and do it real fast.  I do, but I'm in Jersey.  Oh, now you're in Jersey?  Yeah, well, yeah.  I just got off work, so I'm going to try to go pick up my girlfriend and like...  Well, hurry up.  I don't know how much longer they're going to be out there.  Maybe a half hour or so.  Well, next time, all right?  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care.  All right.  Syndication underground, guys.  It's happening.  Let's check in with Psycho Mark.  He's also outside.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's going on?  Oh, man, I'm fine here.  It's absolute madness. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  People are all surrounding him and trying to get some more money to smash.  What's going on?  We've got a bunch of people.  Baz is actually yelling at people right now.  He's really mad.  He's got a nasty face on.  He's got his Rosie O'Donnell hat on sideways.  Yeah, he's taunting everyone, I hear.  And he's holding up his insulting for $5.  Yeah.  $5.  Come on.  Now he's insulting women. 
[01:43:00]  He's just parading people to try and piss them off.  All right.  I'm going to check in with Anthony.  Thank you, Psycho.  Here goes Psycho Mark.  Back to Anthony.  Anthony!  Anthony!  Oh.  Yeah.  He's getting so friggin' raw with some of these women walking by.  What is he saying?  Just insulting them.  Calling them a whore.  Just really bad.  And people are getting the free insults there.  Come on, Baldy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What?  He goes, come on, Baldy.  The guy turned around and gave him a look like he was going to shoot him. 
[01:43:30]  What are you doing in the workforce?  Oh, my God.  What does he say?  That's why they're not hiring you in the workforce.  He's yelling at people of certain ethnicities.  Oh, my God.  And then he wants to stand behind him just in case the round goes through him.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to get caught in the belly when one goes through him.  He just doesn't learn, Anthony.  He really doesn't.  No.  The guy is a friggin' idiot.  Anyone else paying their $5?  No, they're just talking him for free from the sidelines. 
[01:44:00]  No one wants to pay his bill.  No one cares that he's $47,000 in debt.  That's awesome.  Here comes a chick.  Wait a minute.  What's he going to say?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What did he say?  Did he hear it?  No, we didn't hear it over here.  He yelled at this girl, hey, you with the big T's.  The big T's.  Get over here.  He's losing his mind.  He really is losing it.  He's like the dude from...  He's like the dude from...  This poor girl walking by.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  He's like the dude from Full Metal Jacket, Anthony.  Yeah, he is.  He's lost it, just like Full Metal Jacket.  You're right.  All the trucks just loving it.  They're beeping and then hanging out the windows, yelling insults at him.  It's insane, dude.  I'm going to come back upstairs.  This is all well in hand down here.  All right.  Very good.  It's a madhouse.  Very good.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right.  There we go.  You're right.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I got to hang up on Anthony.  That's cool.  All right.  You can abuse spaz for $5 a shot right outside the building. 
[01:45:00]  Obviously, a crazy scene going on.  57th and 7th Street.  Let's check in with Earl one last time, I believe.  He's in Staten Island at the Pergamot handing out the brand new Wow stickers.  We're all over the ball field today.  Earl, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  We're in the parking lot right now.  Just about to wrap things up, we have the lovely Shari here, the lovely 36 double Ds.  She's going to give us a beautiful parting shot.  Oh, she is, huh?  Yes.  And we all have a wow girl and Jen, we'll wrap it up. 
[01:45:30]  That never gets old.  All right, Earl.  Are you out of stickers or what?  With just about that, we're going to pull out and head back to the city.  Okay, very good.  Earl, out there in Staten Island, thank everyone for us.  Thank you for the support in Staten Island. 
[01:46:00]  All right, Earl, we'll see you soon, okay?  All right, talk to you later.  There he goes.  Black Earl doing a great job in Staten Island.  All right, we'll take a quick break.  Anthony will be back in the studio in a few minutes, and we'll continue with the festivities.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony.  Brilliant radio at its best.  Oh, God, help us.  187, never do I ever hear.  Hey, Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Hey, you're a big pig?  Me?  No.  Okay.  No, no.  Speaking in general, just to people, if you've got that big fat ass, looks like you've been 
[01:46:30]  sitting naked in a gravel driveway when you stand up, you know those butts, the big wide  ones?  I haven't seen one close up like that in a long time.  The genitalia awning.  How about that one?  Which we all know as the?  The bunt.  The bunt.  Yes.  Do you have a bunt?  No, I don't.  Because you don't know if it's belly or it's hello.  So, you want to burn that off, don't you?  Yes.  Very nice weather. 
[01:47:00]  Whip them out Wednesday in full force now.  We started it up yesterday.  And it seems to be doing quite well.  And you don't want to have to fight with your fat.  You know, you pull it out, you think you're wowing somebody.  No.  No.  It's a big roll.  Oh, no.  She's got back boobs.  Oh.  She wowed me front and back.  She's got the back boobs working.  That's great.  You don't want that.  So, what do you do?  Stacker 2, World's Strongest Fat Burner.  Help thousands of people lose weight, build lean muscle, get into shape.  You'll feel the effects of Stacker 2 in 45 minutes or your money back. 
[01:47:30]  Guaranteed.  What are you going to do?  You're going to burn fat, build lean muscle, get a boost energy toward the end of the day.  It cuts down on the cravings to snack, adds up to losing weight, and your back fat boobs.  There you go.  Give them a call.  1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E for Stacker 2, the World's Strongest Fat Burner.  Our listeners, Anthony, have proven it works.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, to be wild. 
[01:48:00]  Boo, boo, boo.  Or stupidity on the way.  Rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr.  1-2-7-1-W-N-E-W.  That guy is now dead.  Yeah.  He's dead.  That was an old pal of mine.  Yeah.  Who I hear has passed on.  He drowned.  He drowned it. 
[01:48:30]  He drowned it.  Poor guy.  But his life lives on with a spot in an O&A promo.  How morbid is that?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Anthony back in the studio.  Yeah.  He was outside checking out the festivities.  People abusing spaz for $5 a shot.  You know what the problem is, though?  People don't want to give spaz money.  But they want to insult him.  So, I mean, there is a crap load of people down there just insulting him. 
[01:49:00]  Just for nothing.  And then he gets all agitated and starts taunting the crowd.  There was one guy that walked past.  And he goes, hey, Baldy.  And the guy turned around like he wanted to kill him.  He goes, that's why your kind can't get a job or something like that.  And the guy's looking.  I'm like, I will come over there and snap you.  He's a moron.  He's an idiot.  Well, John the Dump Guy was telling me that he's just yelling at people that have no idea who he is.  A girl walking past Innocent League that was well endowed. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, you with the big, yeah.  The big T's.  Unbelievable.  She had no clue what was going on.  I felt bad for her.  She looked all, you know, innocent and everything.  Not like a whore bag or anything.  And he's like, hey, you with the big T's.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh.  Well, you have time to get down to 57th and 7th and join the little party that we got going on.  They gave him a hat.  Yeah, they gave him a Rosie O'Donnell hat to wear because he's more, they say he would fit in more with that show than this show. 
[01:50:00]  And he gave me his original Boy Scout hat.  Yeah, the Eagle Scout hat.  It's covered with cat hair.  Yeah.  It's just cat hair.  It's white cat hair all over it.  I had to search the 14-inch U-Haul for that.  I think he got his cleanliness badge.  Hey, look who stopped by the radio show today.  Stockbroker Dave.  Stockbroker Dave.  How are you doing, man?  I saw a guy in a suit walking down the hall.  I got scared like we did something wrong again.  Usually it's a lawyer, but no.  No, it's our pal.  Stockbroker Dave.  How are you, Dave? 
[01:50:30]  Fresh off of Wall Street.  Yeah, about an hour.  Yeah, you've been off for about an hour.  Yeah.  Nice.  Dave, why don't you talk into the...  Yeah, microphone's good.  Microphone.  Yeah.  Sorry.  There you go.  No mics on the floor there, O.  No, it's funny.  He's like, he has a lot of personality on the floor.  He gets a little shy in the studio.  He's the man down there.  Yeah.  He's like...  There are no naked chicks up here.  There was yesterday.  You should have been here.  And there's going to be some tomorrow, I believe.  We had a girl with the...  We were dripping hot wax on.  And these candles.  It was great.  That's our new thing. 
[01:51:00]  Have you heard that one yet?  Yeah.  You guys put powder on the shoes down there on the floor?  We drop hot wax on naked girls.  I like your job better.  We were aiming for the balloon nut yesterday.  It was hilarious.  Remember that?  We went down to the floor.  We called him the Kiki.  Our Kiki.  We went down to the floor and Stockbroker Dave showed us around.  They took us around.  It was great.  And all these smart asses on the floor, they get you and they start talking to you.  Like one guy will talk to you and distract you.  While another guy is behind you, he gets down and sprinkles white powder all over your black shine shoes. 
[01:51:30]  And then as you're walking around, they all start pointing at you.  You're going, oh, look at your shoes.  You couldn't have shined your shoes up coming down here on the floor.  Oh, yeah, and they all taunt you.  Yeah, but before they taunt you, you now have the powder on your shoes.  And one guy goes, hey, is it snowing today?  Is it snowing out?  And they're like, no.  What's snowing?  No.  Then why do you have snow on your shoes?  Clean that off.  What are you doing down here with your shoes all over?  And then the whole place just loses it.  This is what these guys do.  That's their job.  Oh, yeah, it's their job. 
[01:52:00]  These are the guys we're giving our hard-earned money to.  The finances of the free world are on their backs,  and they're sprinkling powder and giggling.  On our shoes.  And if someone from, what, the south visits the floor,  you put little spurs on their little shoes, right?  They make spurs and stick it in their heel.  So they walk around with these spurs on.  They're a bunch of smartasses down there.  A bunch of comedians.  They pull a lot of pranks.  What's the prank with the shark fin?  You guys pull that one off every once in a while, right?  You've got to be real stupid to fall for that one. 
[01:52:30]  Who usually do you pull that one on?  Whoever's walking around.  Anyone?  Lobster tails.  On people?  The shark fin is great.  You'll be walking around.  Someone will pat you on the back.  Is that the move?  Yeah.  And you'll be walking around with a shark fin on your back.  You're in your suit.  You're on the floor.  New York Stock Exchange.  And you have a shark fin on your back.  And everyone's laughing at you.  Let's get back to the naked chicks.  Well, no.  Because then the guy has the shark fin on his back.  And then everyone is like... 
[01:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  As the guy passes.  And then after a while, I was realizing, why are they all doing that?  Why are they all doing the Jaws theme as they walk around?  I'm a dick.  A bunch of comedians.  Dave has some great stories to tell.  I don't know if he'll tell them on the air, though.  No, probably not.  Now, let's get some naked chicks up here.  Naked chicks?  No.  How about?  We don't have any today.  We have a contest?  I want to hear about...  I can get them up here.  I want to hear about guys, you know, dying on the floor. 
[01:53:30]  Anyone recently?  No.  No?  Come on.  You can tell a story about something that happened, let's say, 20 years ago.  Snow day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A while ago.  Yeah.  We had that big snowstorm.  Got to try to get in.  Really, really fat guy.  Had a heart attack on the floor.  Nope.  Now, what do you do when someone drops dead on the floor?  Trade over them.  Trade over them.  That's the truth, right?  Yeah.  Because you can't...  Oh, my God.  I'm not getting hooked.  Because you can't touch the body.  You can't touch the body, and there are trades to be made, right? 
[01:54:00]  Hey.  Get out of here.  Just trade over them.  That's brutal.  I love it.  Capitalism.  That is brutal.  It happened.  It happened twice.  It happened twice?  It happened twice.  Not too much pressure going on down there, especially recently.  How much money have you seen somebody lose in, like, one session?  I had an error.  Biggest error was 600 grand.  600 grand.  That was the biggest error on the floor. 
[01:54:30]  And he had to...  It comes out of his pocket.  Yeah.  Like you make a mistake.  Put it right on MasterCard.  Yeah, that's what I would do.  27 grand's nothing.  So, stockbroker Dave wants to work his pimp hand.  You think you could get girls up here?  Yeah.  All right.  How are you going to get girls up to the Opie and Anthony show?  It's late in the show here.  Girls have to be close to the station.  Cold, hard cash?  500 bucks.  What?  500 bucks to the girl who does the best act with an inanimate object. 
[01:55:00]  You have to be up here by 530.  He's got 500 bucks.  Right here.  He does.  Damn, I'll put a dress on.  What the hell?  Look at that money.  I got another 500 bucks, but you gotta let me take pictures.  Five crisp, $100 bills.  All right, so what do you want?  That's why you want to see a sex act.  Uh-oh, now you said the S word.  See, now that's prostitution.  Right.  Now, it just screwed it up.  You just screwed up the whole contest.  It could have been the best act with an inanimate object, which is fun. 
[01:55:30]  Yes, that's what I meant to say.  But since you threw the other word in.  I'm going to hit the dumb button.  I was going to lunge for it, but I don't know.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  He's got $500 right in front of him.  Come on, let's go.  I ended up 500 bucks up like a filet mignon.  That's right.  Plastic is good.  Wood is even better.  Wood. 
[01:56:00]  Don't you get all those pictures on the Internet with fruits and vegetables?  Yeah.  Coke bottles, beer bottles.  I've seen that.  I want to see it live.  Let's go.  That is willing to pay.  And I'm willing to pay.  Dave, I do believe that is illegal.  Something is illegal.  It is.  All right, Dave, give me 500 bucks in a Coke bottle.  I can use the cash.  I can use the cash.  So, yeah, because at this point, and now it's illegal. 
[01:56:30]  It really is.  You know, you and your morals are really...  It's not morals, believe me.  It's legality.  Yeah.  I've become a pro with the legal point of view.  I thought you'd be able to yell a spaz for 55 hours, I think it was.  Can I stick an atom and object in the spaz?  Yeah, that you can do.  Well, there's a few people on the hotline.  Who's who?  Who's on the lines?  Ben's on six.  Thanks.  And Sharon's on five. 
[01:57:00]  Sharon?  Uh, Sharon?  Uh, Ben, what's going on?  What?  Oh!  Hey, Ben!  Hello?  Hey, Ben.  Yes, it's Spaz.  Oh, Spaz, what's going on?  It's O.P. and Anthony.  How are you?  What's up?  How's it going down there?  I'm insulting all these people, and they're just, they're not coming up.  I'm coming out with, I'm pulling out all the stops, and something, he's degenerate,  and, oh yeah, I haven't started with the race stuff, I just might dab into that right  now.  Oh, no.  Spaz.  You're going to get shot.  Spaz, calm down. 
[01:57:30]  You're going postal on us, right in front of our eyes here.  Spaz is so stupid, he's turning the whole thing around.  These people are not giving in.  They're not giving in?  He's giving me a blast.  I keep watching little girls across the street, I just might sing I'm horny for little girls.  All right, well.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you taunt the crowd a little bit, live on the air?  I'm horny for little girls.  Oh, Jesus.  There's a couple of kids in front of me now.  Yeah?  Stop it!  Stop it!  Put a bet on.  All right, well, how's it going?  People just hate him.  People just hate him.  Yeah, there is a deep hatred. 
[01:58:00]  Sir, put it back to me!  Now, Ben, are people still paying the money to insult him?  Yeah, people are still paying.  We've now got a lot of tourists.  We've got a bunch of little girls in front of us.  Oh, great.  And he's dove into the Chew jokes, and he told me he's just going to have a strike.  That.  Are you all up to the line?  He's harassing everybody that goes by, calling guys with no hair baldies.  Hey, it's Jemima.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Oh, dude.  Oh, my God. 
[01:58:30]  Who wants to be 80?  He is a complete friggin' idiot.  He is.  Now there's a couple of brothers really looking at him, like, staring him down.  Yeah.  How many people?  Something just got thrown at him.  Uh-oh.  Hang on.  Here he is.  What's up?  Spaz, what are you, stupid?  What are you, insane?  Uh, no.  I'm just trying to earn my money.  Who do you think is going to protect you down there?  Uh, because.  Oh, yeah.  He can hold everyone back?  No one will protect you.  Santa Claus.  Santa Claus. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, Santa Claus.  Yeah.  Get off your fat ass and give me some money and insult me.  Yeah.  Shave that beard, you piece of crap.  Don't beg you to be in the grave in two years anyway.  Give me your money.  No, he's not going to get my ass, baby.  That's $5.  That's fucking hard.  All right, thanks.  All right, put Ben on.  A very older gentleman that he just insulted and called Santa Claus.  The guy turned around and put his ass and spaz his face. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, Ben, I'm here and they're trying to break up the crowd at this point.  Yeah, it's funny.  The cops have come by.  There's a couple maniacs that keep running out into the middle of the street and stopping buses and handing out wow stickers.  And then all the tourists from the Hard Rock are just like trying to figure out what's going on.  So there's a bunch of little kids here.  It's a true scene of disaster.  Yeah.  All right.  We will stay down here and continue to collect money for spaz.  All right, man.  Very good.  Thank you, Ben. 
[02:00:00]  There you go, outside the building.  Hour two of spaz-a-thon.  What a cluster F.  Yeah, Bob, what's going on?  Oh, man, I just got a ticket from some Moulinion cop just sitting in front of the building.  Well, you can't park illegally.  I wasn't parked.  I was just kind of like pulling in front.  Right.  Just to get a look and then I was splitting.  I'm dumping out of that.  People are insane.  Dumping out of that.  Dumping out of that.  Dumping out of that.  You got to.  So Dave.  We're doomed as a society. 
[02:00:30]  So Dave has got the $500 over there.  Not one girl has called, Dave.  It's not looking good.  Look how upset he is.  Things happen at bachelor parties and they get paid.  A lot cheaper than $500.  Yeah.  Not that I've heard.  So I've heard.  Yeah.  You don't want to go home today, Dave?  That ain't right, O.  That ain't right. 
[02:01:00]  Does that have somewhere to go?  I'm going to my first bachelor party in years, Saturday night.  Who's getting married?  One of the guys from Works Cousins.  What do they got planned?  Well, going to dinner at La Verona and then going to some joint in here.  I don't know which one.  Oh, that's good, Joe.  Thanks.  It's been a while.  Why can't I go?  You can.  You're invited.  In fact, I told them I was going to tell you guys about it.  Does the wife know where you'll be going?  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Hell yeah, she does.  She said she wants to.  She's got to do me before I go.  Unload the weapon.  Yes.  That's what they say.  Yeah.  Unload the weapon.  Put it on safe.  My father-in-law is probably listening.  I don't care.  Sorry, Tom.  It's this show.  What do they expect?  That's true.  Please.  Ladies, you've got to unload the weapons before you send them to a bachelor party.  To the bachelor party.  Sixth scene.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  All right, man.  We've got to take a leak. 
[02:02:00]  Yes, we do.  I've been sitting here for a half hour.  I don't know.  I think we're going to wrap up the spaz thing outside the building.  Yeah.  It sounds like it's just getting ugly out there.  It's degenerated into an angry mob and spaz.  Right.  And an insulting spaz.  Wait a minute.  What?  Something coming in for Stockbroker Dave?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Anthony.  How are you guys?  Good.  What's up?  Stockbroker Dave. 
[02:02:30]  Come in tomorrow.  We'll put on a little show for you tomorrow.  Can you come in tomorrow, Stockbroker Dave?  We'll take care of you tomorrow.  Can't.  Oh.  Oh.  Can't.  Come on, Dave.  All the money you got, you can take a day off.  What time?  What time?  Around 4 o'clock.  Well, the market closes at 4.  All right.  So, tell them to come down like 5 o'clock.  5?  Yeah.  We'll get Shannon.  I'll bring somebody else down.  We'll bring a couple of girls down tomorrow.  How's that?  Hi, Elp.  How are you?  Listen, Elp. 
[02:03:00]  You're speaking to Anthony, man.  What percentage do you get?  I get no percentage, Dave.  Don't worry about it.  Who's on the phone?  Me.  Who are you?  Oh, wow.  Anthony Limbaugh.  You know this guy, Ed.  Oh, man.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Your phone's crapping out.  We'll see you tomorrow with the girls, okay?  See you tomorrow, bro.  Maybe Dave will make it.  Maybe not.  Stay well.  All right.  I mean, something tells me he'll find the time. 
[02:03:30]  Dave will figure something out.  Don't you have softball practice tomorrow or something?  Something.  Colleen, it's an emergency.  I must come into the radio station tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right, Ed.  Let's take a break.  Sure, Joe.  Let's take a break.  And we'll regroup.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  And.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay.  Terrific.  And cut.  Opie.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, Anthony Diamond Vision.  That's right, Opie.  Yeah, Dr. Philitav is like Jesus Christ.  Walking the world.  Healing people.  Yeah, he took care of my eyesight.  Yeah.  Wasn't born with the best vision, but.  Opie wore glasses since he was how old?  Oh, my God.  Like eight.  And you thought you were just going to wear them for the rest of your life.  That was it.  Without a doubt, had a nasty stigmatism, which just was a nightmare.  Oh, you could get those burnt off.  Oh, stigma.  Oh, I said something else. 
[02:04:30]  I thought it was syphilis.  No, they.  But they took care of the stigmatism.  And I also have 2015 vision now.  Thanks to Dr. Philitav and Diamond Vision, Anthony.  You broke your glasses.  Smashed them with a hammer because you'll never need them again.  No.  Don't need them at all.  Quick, easy procedure.  Like 20 minutes.  You're out of the office.  Piece of cake.  A lot of people doing research on the correction procedure.  You don't have to do your research anymore.  I researched it for a year, and I felt confident with Diamond Vision and Dr. Philitav. 
[02:05:00]  And it was a piece of cake, Anthony.  Very easy.  Very quick.  There's a couple things going on right now.  He's running his Memorial Day special or his Memorial Day drawing.  One of our listeners is going to get a free procedure thanks to Diamond Vision and Dr. Philitav.  All you have to do is give them a call at 1-800-984-2020.  They'll put your name in the drawing, and one of you guys will get a free procedure, okay?  Right.  If you entered a past drawing, your name will be in this drawing as well, so you don't have to call, okay? 
[02:05:30]  Also, he's running his spring special, Anthony.  $2,500 for the whole procedure.  $2,500 for the whole damn procedure.  Both eyes.  That's a bargain if you call Diamond Vision right now.  1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  O.P.S. Ampiration.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey!  All right, Psycho Mark is on the phone. 
[02:06:00]  I think they're wrapping up downstairs.  Let's go to him real fast.  All right.  There's a girl on the line that wants to take Dave up on his offer.  We'll see what she's about in a second, but first, Psycho Mark.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, that punk never sounded so good.  Never mind.  That's what you guys were just playing.  No, I know.  Okay, terrific.  He's just got a water dumped all over his head by this guy.  He walked up and poured an entire glass of water on him.  Oh, jeez.  It's getting violent.  I knew it.  Dude, he's screaming at people.  He is seriously going to get himself beat up. 
[02:06:30]  I know.  He's an idiot.  He's screaming at people.  He's like insulting people, like left and right.  He's stupid.  It's really funny.  These two black ladies came up, and they just absolutely let him have it.  Two sisters just went house on his ass.  Went house.  House.  All right, so is it breaking up down there, or what?  No, it's still strong.  People are still showing up.  We've got plenty of wild stickers here in case you're in the mid-town area.  All right.  And here we are.  So come on by in the Salt Spans for five bucks, and help the poor bastard out. 
[02:07:00]  All right, 57th and 7th Street.  I'd love to get him up here at some point to see what he looks like.  Yeah.  Uh-oh, he's just got this huge fat guy to himself.  Oh, my God.  He just screamed at a nun.  There's a nun walking down the street.  Did he call him a penguin?  Yeah.  We're trying to get her to yell at him, but she's like, no.  What an idiot.  All right, Psycho Mark, thanks.  Bye, guys.  All right, man.  All right, let's talk to Janice. 
[02:07:30]  Janice, what's going on?  You're next on NEW.  Hi.  Hi, Janice.  Hi, how are you doing?  Doing well.  What do you want to do?  I could give you a little show.  I heard on the radio with that stockbroker Dave.  Yeah.  If you pick the object, I'll give you a little show.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Why don't you tell us a little about yourself?  Yeah, because you sound like a pig.  What do you want to know?  What do you look like?  I'm beautiful. 
[02:08:00]  I have reddish-brown hair, hazel eyes.  I'm a professional escort.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Professional escort.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  So you've done this before.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  So how close are you?  I'm not that far away.  Give me, like, 30 minutes.  30 minutes?  You got it.  Okay.  Yeah.  All righty.  Okay.  All right.  You know where to go?  Give me the street.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  Yeah.  Professional escort coming down to the station. 
[02:08:30]  Escort.  Line 10, stinky.  Uh-oh.  That's another word for escort.  Vanessa, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  All right.  I love the show.  My friend hooked me up with this show.  He listens to you guys all the time.  Word?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I heard you guys wanted girls to come down to the studio.  No doubt.  No doubt.  Uh, Stockbroker Dave would like to see some stuff today, yes.  Yeah.  Well, um, my friend always likes me to put a little show on for him, so. 
[02:09:00]  Well, how far are you from the station?  About 40 minutes.  That might be, uh, that might be tough to pull off.  Hmm.  40 minutes, huh?  Yeah, I'm in Jersey right now.  Yeah, it's going to take you more than 40 minutes to get here today.  Hmm.  Uh, how about next time?  I think we got someone coming down.  Okay.  All right, Vanessa, but thanks for listening.  All right, thank you.  All right, man.  Bye.  Very good.  We're turning whores away at the door.  Elena.  You boys are stupid.  At least you would have screened the phone call. 
[02:09:30]  You boys are idiots.  Not bad, dude.  Not bad is right.  Take easy, boys.  All right, bye.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Mm-hmm.  Ben, he says the scene outside the building is absolutely insane.  Uh, Spaz has lost his mind.  He's just abusing every single person that walks by the, the studio.  He's not, he's not playing the sympathy angle, that's for sure.  No, not at all.  And, uh, one of the girls I guess he abused is on the phone here.  Lola, what's going on?  Hello?  Hi, Lola.  Hello.  Hey. 
[02:10:00]  You're on the air.  What's up?  Oh, nothing.  Are you guys responsible for that?  Uh, for what, Lola?  What happened to you today outside the building?  I was harassed.  You were harassed?  I was harassed.  Bye.  You were walking by?  I was walking by and, um, he said something about me looking, uh, something about a nice  piece of ass or something.  Oh, my God.  So, I just want to know if you guys are responsible for it.  And I was like, you are.  Well, I don't know.  I think Spaz is his own man.  Yeah.  I want you guys to make him do it, right?  We sent him down there to get abused by the public, not to abuse the public. 
[02:10:30]  He's turned it around.  He's a maniac.  But, in fact, he's given the money back.  And I used to like you guys, too.  Well, we had nothing to do with that.  The bit was abused Spaz, but he's lost his mind.  Now, I hear whoever walks by, he's, uh, he's attacking.  Yes, he is.  Are you a nice piece of ass?  Of course I am.  Well, then, it was a compliment, I guess.  I guess so.  And I apologize, uh, for Spaz, okay?  No, you don't have to.  It's all right.  I'll still listen to you guys.  All right, Lola.  Take care.  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Bye.  I hope he gave her a five bucks.  Joe, are you still chewing gum?  No.  Because the people on the Instant Feedback are losing it.  Not me.  One guy's like, who the F is chewing the gum today on the air?  Can't you gum it into the mic?  No.  All right, uh, we want to play the Ben Stein bit one last time here, Anthony.  Oh, stupid Ben.  I'm not stupid.  Uh, well, Joe, Anthony's brother came up with a cute little bit here.  With Ben Stein's approval, it's called, Anthony.  Yes.  I guess everyone knows his story by now.  We had Ben Stein on the air a week ago. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, he hung up because he thought Anthony said, Jew down.  I said, chew down the price.  And I can attest to that, that we've been saying, chew down price for years.  Oh, stop.  Ben Stein was out of his mind.  We're going to sell the Volkswagen, Anthony.  Don't let him chew down the price.  That's right.  Yeah.  Well, we all know Ben Stein was out of his mind.  I think that's obvious.  Mm-hmm.  God knows what Entertainment Weekly's going to write about.  I'm sure we'll be hung out to dry.  We did an interview with that over the Ben Stein thing.  That's okay.  Could be ugly. 
[02:12:00]  But if, uh, if you were following the Ben Stein, uh, incident, this, uh, will make you chuckle  a little bit.  It's, uh, Joe with Win Ben Stein's Approval.  Check this out.  Hello, and welcome to Win Ben Stein's Approval.  I'm your host, Ben Stein.  This is the show where varied mutants of bastard ethnicity try to win my approval.  Our first contestant is from Chinatown. 
[02:12:30]  So please give a warm welcome for Wang Nohang.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. Stein.  Now, Wang, your first question is, what was the name of the Wookiee in the motion picture  Star Wars?  Oh, that's easy, Mr. Stein.  That's easy.  That would be a Chewbacca.  Oh, Chewbacca, huh?  No.  You've insulted my people.  Now get out of my studio. 
[02:13:00]  But, Mr. Stein, I said...  You rice-packing, slanty-eyed, gook, slope-faced, yellow, chinky bastard.  Security, have this man removed.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Our next contestant to try to win my approval is from Compton, California.  Please welcome Dick Black.  Why, thank you all, Mr. Stein.  It's showing me a pleasure to be here.  Okay, Dick, your first question is, what article of clothing is used to cover your feet? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, that's easy, Mr. Stein.  Dems would be shoes.  Excuse me.  Yes, sir?  Did I just hear you say, juice?  Oh, no, no, lordy no, Mr. Stein.  I swear, I said shoes.  I don't believe you.  You spade, jungle bunny, jigger, jigger, boo, coon, mouth-mouth, picketing, porch, man, vehicle, town, ship, and dying, spear checker. 
[02:14:00]  My goodness, Mr. Stein.  Security, have this man beaten.  No, no.  Wow.  Help me.  Help me.  Sorry, that's all the time we have for today.  See you next time when some mutants of human mongrel bastards try to win Ben Stein's approval.  Our listeners are so quick and with it.  Steven.  Or whoever your name is.  All right.  Me?  Yeah, well, yes, you. 
[02:14:30]  You just spoke.  Go ahead, talk.  You.  Yeah, me?  Yeah, what's your name?  Steven.  Well, what?  You fucking asshole.  Oh, my God.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, he's very upset.  All I want to do is to be a bitch.  How stupid do you have to be to be on the phone and someone calls your name and you don't answer?  All I want to do is to be a bitch.  Shut up. 
[02:15:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  You fucking asshole.  Did he just lose his effing mind?  I hate people I don't care.  God damn, does that piss me off.  I'm a freaking lunatic.  You are. 
[02:15:30]  All right, Anthony, Spaz just got arrested.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  All right, hold on.  We got two spots to go.  We'll be right back.  Two minutes and we'll go to Ben on the street.  Spaz has been arrested.  Oh, oh.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to, you know, tune in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Opie and Anthony, we refuse to be responsible.  We refuse to be responsible.  All right, we're back. 
[02:16:00]  We're getting word that Spaz just got arrested, Anthony.  Why don't you explain what has been going on all afternoon real fast for the people just tuning in, Ed?  Well, we put Spaz down on 57th Street dressed up in his old Boy Scout uniform.  He has $47,000 in debt, so we figured we'd get him some money by allowing the listeners to pay five bucks a clip to insult him.  But it turned around where he started insulting the crowd that was walking by him and getting pretty belligerent.  Yeah, people that don't even know us or the show just minding their own business and Spaz losing it. 
[02:16:30]  He was telling women that they have nice tees.  Yeah.  He's racial epithets he's thrown out there.  Yeah.  And now Ben just called up and said that he got arrested.  Yeah, he was yelling at nuns and just about everyone that walked by him.  He's got to learn.  Let's go to line eight.  Blonde, what's going on?  Hey, yeah.  I was out front and then Spaz was just insulting everybody, even including a nun.  And then all of a sudden the cops came out in a blue car, pulled him away.  And he was still with the sign, holding it out and screaming in the car. 
[02:17:00]  And what did they do?  They just hauled him off.  Psycho Mark was trying to pull him over and tell him this is a promotion for a radio, but they wouldn't stop.  They just hauled him away.  I hope he collected enough money for the bail.  For the bail.  Oh, man.  All right.  Ben's on the line.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  If anyone else checked it out, please give us a call.  Ben.  Yo.  What's going on?  He's in the back of the police car, told by the officers that he's being arrested for yelling racial epithets at people walking by. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  And they're in the car.  People are saying free spaz.  Free spaz.  Free spaz.  What, are you guys losing your mind?  Someone wants to know if he got arrested for impersonating a Boy Scout.  I have one of the officers right here.  You want to talk to him?  Uh, yeah.  All right.  Hello.  Hey.  Hey.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What's going on? 
[02:18:00]  Who's this?  Opie or Anthony?  Oh, what's up, man?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  We've got spaz.  You've got spaz in the car?  Yeah.  He was inciting a crowd yelling at him none.  You're right, guys.  So you put him in the car?  He's gone.  Oh, my God.  Now, how much bail are we going to have to collect here?  What do you think this will cost?  I don't know about bail.  They're probably going to hold him overnight.  Oh, no.  Please, if you're a fan of this radio show, please do that.  What, let him go?  No, hold him overnight. 
[02:18:30]  Hold him overnight.  Where are you taking him?  You guys know we support you.  We talk about you all the time.  For the love of God, make sure he spends the night in jail.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Spaz is going to be a hot commodity in prison, Jim is saying online now.  He's going to have to go down to the tombs for the night.  They're taking him to the tombs?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Boy Scout uniform.  And then the Boy Scout uniform.  A skinny white boy in a Boy Scout uniform.  That's like some of the fantasies those guys have down there. 
[02:19:00]  He better hope that they put him in his own hold himself.  God, please deliver to me a skinny white boy in a Boy Scout uniform.  Oh, look at that.  Can we talk to Spaz?  Yeah, hold on.  This can be considered his one phone call.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  Spaz, what happened?  I don't know.  I was just insulting people because they weren't stepping up.  And then these two cops just came out of the blue car and took me into the car.  Didn't you know what you were doing was a crime? 
[02:19:30]  No.  Now they're saying I have to go to be booked?  Yeah.  You probably go to Central Booking and then they'll send you to the tombs overnight.  But why?  Can you guys get me out of this?  We have to wait for you to get processed and then we'll see how much bail money we need.  We would have gotten you out of it.  But I think Psycho Mark used our last get out of jail free thing last night when he was drunk on 57.  That's right.  You can't talk to the cops right now. 
[02:20:00]  Maybe let me go.  Are you going to cry?  You're whining now.  Take it like a man.  It's my first offense.  The only thing worse than going to a correctional facility in a Boy Scout uniform is crying in a Boy Scout uniform.  I can't have a record.  Spaz, you're all brave on the sidewalk.  Now look at you.  Spaz, don't worry.  We'll spread around the correctional facility.  You weren't arrested for inciting a riot.  You were arrested for kid touching.  They'll treat you better.  Talk to these guys.  Maybe they'll let me go. 
[02:20:30]  Please.  I don't know if we want that.  I do a good job for you guys.  Hold on.  We're going to let you sit there for a little while.  What are they saying?  They're taking over.  What are they saying that's going to happen?  They're saying they're going to bring me down to get things printed and booked and my picture taken and stuff.  All right.  You got a picture.  The mug shots and the whole nine yards are stained.  Spaz, they did tell us that you're going to have to spend...  I'm seeing a bubble.  Arrested for kid touching.  Oh, my God.  They did say you're going to have to spend the night, Spaz.  Spaz, did you make enough money for some soap on a rope? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, I know.  That's a handy thing to have in the joint.  Soap on a rope.  I don't want to go to jail.  Oh, no.  He's crying.  Hey, let's make Spaz cry.  Oh, no.  Spaz, how much money did you collect today?  Ben has it.  What?  Ben has the money.  Well, yell to Ben.  See how much money he's got for you tonight.  Ask the cops how much bail is going to be.  Ben!  Ben!  How much money did we collect today?  He's crying. 
[02:21:30]  Collected about 200.  Ask the cops how much bail we need.  How much bail do we need?  We've got to go.  They've got to go.  Spaz.  I can't...  Spaz.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Spaz.  They took the phone from him.  Spaz!  Spaz, offer them a bribe.  200 bucks, Spaz.  It's a good bribe.  Spaz.  We lost him.  They cut him off.  Oh, my God.  They're taking him to jail.  Sounds right in central booking, man. 
[02:22:00]  Tom, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Guys, I almost drove off the road here in this.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God, this is a dream come true.  Spaz is getting arrested.  Spaz actually got arrested.  It really didn't sink in yet.  I know.  This is sick.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's got to protect his bunk.  Indication on the ground.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  People already requesting.  Line four.  Oh, line four.  Where's line four? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, okay.  Yes, let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I want Spaz's T-shirt.  I want his mugshot on T-shirt, just like Jim Morrison T-shirt.  Yeah, how long before we see this Spaz mugshot?  I want a big poster of Spaz's mugshot on the Raw next week.  And you know what the worst thing is?  That was just Spaz's last phone call, the one phone call he gets to make.  Oh, God.  Syndication underground, boys.  All right, the NYPD is back in line.  Thank you.  Let's go to Andy.  Andy.  Yeah, listen, this is Andy.  I'm a New York City police officer. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  The first thing that's going to happen is they're going to search him in front of the precinct,  in front of a death sergeant.  Yeah.  Then they're going to take him to the back end, strip him, and then search him again.  He's going to get stripped.  Oh, my God, no.  Then they're going to process it.  We've all seen him naked.  It's not a pretty sight.  All right, hold on.  You've got to back up.  So they're going to strip search him, and then what?  And then what they do is they throw him in a cell, and then they process it.  They do the fingerprinting, then they send that to Albany. 
[02:23:30]  Hopefully that will come back clean.  Then he goes before the judge tonight or tomorrow morning.  And how much money are we in?  No, no, no.  There's no station house bail.  He's going to go right through the system.  That means he's going to be lined up, stacked up, with the crackheads.  Who is the pimp?  Oh, my God.  Come on, man.  You look kind of cute in that uniform.  Listen, they also don't like short eyes.  That's the terminology for guys that touch little children. 
[02:24:00]  Yes.  Well, he does have that wacky little Eagle Scout uniform on.  Yeah.  Were you outside the building, Andy, or are you just helping us out with the info here?  I'm helping you out with the info.  I almost crashed on the Staten Island Express, so I listen to him cry.  Yeah, spaz crying isn't a good thing in the back of the police car.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know what?  That's good for his ass, because every time I call, he hangs up on me.  So payback is a, you know what it is.  I can't say it on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, a lot of people around the Opie and Anthony show are discovering that payback's a bitch lately. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, it is.  Totally.  And listen, those signs yesterday over the skyline, that was awesome.  Oh, yeah.  You like the big wow in the sky?  Oh, that was great.  I think we made radio history yesterday, man.  That guy risked a lot of things to get up there to put the wow in the sky over Central Park.  Yeah, it did.  You know what?  Cook, a lot.  And you know what?  You guys are number one in New York City, and the NYPD loves you guys, too.  Thanks, man.  Well, that's why we need you to rough up spaz a little bit.  Oh, my God.  Don't say that.  Why?  Because reports are already coming in. 
[02:25:00]  Angelo from Rikers says that spaz is already up to six cigarette cartons.  They're trading already.  They're already buying this kid.  Well, tonight's song for him is going to be called Sue.  Whee!  Well, Chris from the city, spaz's night in jail is cheaper than a hotel room.  Yeah, I don't think the butler's going to be ironing his heavy metal T-shirt tonight.  All right.  We'll tell you again about Rikers.  All right.  You're going to have a great time.  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys rule syndication now. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  We're trying.  Joe from Brooklyn.  I haven't heard someone scream Ben so desperately since the last time I saw Star Wars.  That's the last words we heard from spaz.  Ben!  Ben!  As the cop car drove away.  Oh, this is sick.  I'm feeling bad for the kid now.  Tonight he's going to sound like the chick in The Graduate.  Ben!  Oh, my God.  Spaz's life just sucks. 
[02:26:00]  Let's go.  Gorky spaz.  We're getting a bunch of emails coming in.  Let's go to Keith.  Hey.  Someone's got to call us back and tell us what's going on.  They drove off with spaz.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, how much more credit does spaz have left on his credit card after his $3,000 birthday?  No, he...  Put that on the...  What's that?  He used all the rest of his credit on his credit card to put the down payment on his apartment.  I know that you can use the credit card and fail. 
[02:26:30]  They could be able to put that down or what?  I don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know anything right now.  The last thing we heard was spaz yelling for Ben, and Ben hasn't called back yet.  I got a cousin in there.  I'll give him a call and tell him to look out for spaz.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  George, what's going on?  I got to tell you, I just got home from work.  I just got off the train.  People are looking at me like I'm a psycho, because I'm crying and tears from laughing.  Oh, God.  I think a lot of people are laughing.  Oh, this... 
[02:27:00]  God bless this happening, man.  I can't...  I'm having trouble laughing at this.  I really am.  I mean, the whole...  No, because on the outside, it's very funny and everything, but, I mean, picture little  spaz in a Cub Scout uniform going to jail.  Oh, he's going to be sweet and eating a pen tonight.  Oh, my God.  All right, George.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  Did you ever watch that show, Oz, Opie?  Of course I have.  You see what happens to the new fish?  Yeah, it's not good.  It's not pretty. 
[02:27:30]  Eve, what's going on?  Eve.  Yeah.  How are you?  What's up, ONA?  No, I'm on.  Yo, please send him to jail.  Please let him give somebody a rusty trump on.  He's such a dick.  Please.  We don't know what's going on.  The last thing we heard was what you guys heard.  Ben!  Yo, he has hung up on me on so many occasions.  Please send him to jail.  Please.  All right, Eve.  Thank you.  I am outraged that this hasn't happened sooner.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing? 
[02:28:00]  Great, man.  Oh, Ben!  Ben!  That is the best payback in the whole world.  That's the battle cry of Strasnaut.  Ben!  I call you guys, like, religiously, and, like, if he doesn't like what you say in two seconds,  it's like, hang up the phone.  Yeah, yeah.  He's, like, gone at a phone thing over there.  I know he is.  Oh, Ben!  Ben!  Hey, you guys are great, man.  All right, paybacks and bets.  We're learning that lately around here.  Payback's a bitch. 
[02:28:30]  Obi-Wan Kenobi checking in, Opie.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You will never see a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  Why didn't Spaz just pull some of that Jedi Minecraft on him?  I'm not the Spaz you're looking for.  Big Kevin back in the studio, he was bodyguarding Spaz out there when our listeners were abusing Spaz.  Kevin, what happened?  What did you see out there?  I couldn't believe that there weren't more people coming up to insult Spaz, 
[02:29:00]  and so Spaz finally had to resort to insulting people as they walked by.  Right.  And he'd pick out anything from their weight to perhaps their religion.  Yeah, I was hearing that.  Their lack of hair.  Yes.  The follicly impaired were victims of Spaz.  There's some other things that I don't think I should say.  Well-endowed lady.  Unbelievable.  Right.  Black people.  So what did you see?  I swear to God, I heard him yell Aunt Jemima to a black woman. 
[02:29:30]  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  So that'll really help him out in the joint tonight.  Oh, Jesus.  So what did you see?  The cops grabbed him and threw him in an unmarked?  Yes, and he was waving his sign the whole time.  In fact, somebody walked up to the police car as it was making its way around the corner  and slipped a $5 bill in the window and just flipped Spaz off as they took him away.  Take that with you. 
[02:30:00]  All right, Kev.  Thank you.  Everybody checking in on instant feedback with just writing,  Ben, his famous last words.  Ben!  Ben!  Ben!  All right, let's go to Adam.  Adam, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Actually, I think it's pretty cool that Spaz was waving the sign all the way in.  I've got to give him that.  But I think if he gets another call from jail, you guys should just say,  we're not talking about that anymore and hang up on him like he does to us.  Hey, education underground, guys. 
[02:30:30]  All right, thank you.  Bye.  All right, let's go to Johnny.  Johnny, you're next on N.E.W.  Hello.  Hey.  Oh, my little dick-o-scout boy.  He's going to have such a good time tonight.  Dude, quiet, sir.  I think he's trying to do a Dr. Smith.  Yeah, that's...  That's exactly what you've got to do.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Oh, look at that.  The pictures of...  We've got to give these right to Steve.  The pictures of Stinky and our boss, Ken. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, look at that.  I see it.  Arms around each other at last night's party.  Uh-huh.  Spaz couldn't make it.  And he was always talking about hanging out with Ken Stevens, our big boss.  And Stinky, who is actually Spaz's employee, was right here with Ken Stevens drinking it up.  Look.  His arms around him.  Here's another picture of them just conversing.  Looks like he's not going to have the opportunity again for another three to five.  No.  There you go, Steve.  Take him away. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, man.  Let's go to Rich.  The phones are just going nuts.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, maybe Spaz can get a cameo appearance on Oz now.  He'll definitely have the experience.  Yeah.  He'll have some of his bet that way.  All right, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Steve wondering if Ben's last name is Dover.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  Hey, what a mess.  It's always a mess on this damn radio show.  The Spaz, Brett from the Tombs, wondering if Spaz has a purdy mouth. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  All right.  Here he comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhuman Show.  1027 WNAW.  Rockaway betting, Anthony.  Rockaway betting.

[02:34:00]  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting.  It's true.  Opie and Anthony.  027.  Anthony W.  It's the O&A show.  Never a dull moment around here, that's for sure.  Spaz has been arrested.  Spaz has been arrested.  News bulletin.  Spaz has been arrested.  They carted him away in a cop box.  And I guess there's other things going on outside, Anthony. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  From what I'm hearing.  Anthony, very pissed off right now.  Yeah, well, it's ridiculous.  A little bit of a double standard going on.  Oh, that's the cash that we're going to need to bail Spaz out.  Count the cash, because we're going to need it for bail money for Spaz.  We'll hear from him eventually.  You know what's funny?  After the court appearances and lawyer fees, he's now going to be about $50,000 in debt.  This worked really well.  All right, so what's going on outside?  I hear some other worthless station, a station that doesn't get ratings, was trying to interfere with our little shindig downstairs. 
[02:35:00]  I believe the same station that has started playing our bits to try to get our listeners to listen to them.  Passing by with a bullhorn, yelling and harassing our audience.  Correct.  Out in front of our building.  That's correct.  That's correct.  Boy, gee, weren't we instructed after a cry fest from someone else that we weren't to do anything like that to them? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, we're more than willing to fight, but we were told we're not allowed to fight anymore.  But if you want to, believe me, if you want to battle, if you want us to unleash the troops on your sorry asses, come on, feel free.  But don't go crying to the boss when we unleash, because it will get so friggin' ugly, your head will spin.  Your head will spin around.  Believe me.  Do you really want to be enemy of the show?  Do you?  Once dubbed enemy of the show, it's disgusting. 
[02:36:00]  We end up feeling bad for you.  See, there is a true double standard going on.  We've been told we're not allowed to talk about any other stations that are owned by this company.  Or interrupt any other stations.  Or appearances.  Right, correct.  Correct.  And what have we done?  Left it alone.  You know why?  It's inconsequential.  These people are a gnat on our asses at this point.  We're destroying them.  They're trying to get attention.  Was it actually another station, or was it Joe?  Joe!  No. 
[02:36:30]  Real subtle.  No, it's inconsequential.  They are nothing.  They're just trying to get attention.  But, you know, when you go crying to our bosses and say, you know, they're picking on me and we can't handle it.  We can't fight back.  So we're going to make you stop.  We're going to tell our boss and he's going to call your boss and make you stop.  So we have a choice here.  We'll approach our boss.  Oh, they'll call your boss and tell you to stop. 
[02:37:00]  Or we pull out the stops and go to war.  Yeah.  I'm all for that.  We have no problem going to war.  I would love it.  We'll make you guys cry.  It will be insane.  You won't be able to step out of your effing building without being destroyed.  You want that?  So what went on?  Don't mention the station because they'll dump out of you.  And believe me.  What went on?  The battle will be real fair when you're able to pipe in after playing 20,000 songs.  When we could just sit here on a tirade and rally the troops. 
[02:37:30]  And you have to, maybe in between a Foo Fighters tune, you could launch something.  Yeah, try to attack us back.  Boy, real fair.  With one of your cute little Scud missiles when we're blowing atomic bombs your way.  So what happened?  I need to know because you don't understand the crap we have to deal with when we're not on the air.  We're told to do something for the company.  We haven't done anything.  We've listened to the rules that have been set down. 
[02:38:00]  Because we don't have to talk about them.  We don't care.  So Spaz is outside.  He's getting insulted.  A certain van drives by.  And what happened?  Well, this is when he actually was, right after he got arrested.  A certain van drives by with a bullhorn and starts to haggle our listeners.  Oh, boy.  Gee.  Exactly what they told us not to ever do again.  They went as far as getting out of the van and coming over and haggling.  And now a young lady stepped up.  And stuck a sticker on their van. 
[02:38:30]  Okay.  He grabbed her.  He grabbed her.  Grabbed one of our listeners.  Oh, interesting.  That's nice.  Very good.  That's really nice.  Good, good, good.  Grab the listener.  Tossed her away.  Well, Ant and I need to know what we're going to do about this right now.  Because we're ready to unleash the troops.  Where's Ken or Jeremy?  Are they around?  I don't know.  He's in his office.  He's down in his office.  I already informed him about it.  Okay.  Because we've got about 60 seconds before a tirade is unleashed. 
[02:39:00]  Before the Enola Gay leaves the friggin' tarmac.  Colonel Tibbetts at the helm.  Colonel Tibbetts is ready to bomb.  Believe me.  It will be so friggin' ugly.  Look, let us fight.  We'll fight.  Yeah.  I sound like Jay Moore now.  Let us fight.  But we'll fight.  You want to play like that?  Dude, they came right after us.  You know?  It was like, you know, that memo we all got.  We're the biggest sons of...  We get dumped out of at the mention of names on this show.  And if we pulled something like that, I swear to God, we'd either be suspended or fired. 
[02:39:30]  Or another month tacked on to our syndication.  Tacked on to our sentence.  They are the sneakiest mother effers in this town.  Pussy babies, too.  We do one thing.  It's cry.  Cry to the boss.  Look what they're doing to us.  And we're like, we don't care.  We'll fight fair.  I don't care.  Let's roll.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let us fight.  But no.  Yesterday, they played one of our bits on their show.  That's always good. 
[02:40:00]  To get our listeners to listen.  They played Stephen Lynch.  The engines revving up on the tarmac.  Colonel Tibbetts.  And the man, the crew, will be in all the day.  Preparing to take off.  He's on the phone with that station.  He's on the phone with that station.  Good.  We'll sit here and wait.  Good.  Let's find out.  Let's see what happens.  Before we dub somebody enemy of the show. 
[02:40:30]  Alert the airfield.  I beg you.  I beg you to let us fight.  I'm always up for a good brawl.  Yeah.  Well, let's go.  The super fortress.  Engines.  Smoke blowing out.  A deadly cargo.  And a fuselage.  You guys need to do some kind of chain all the way down the hall so we know what has been said.  God, let us fight.  Here we are at the airfield. 
[02:41:00]  There she goes, clearing the trees on her way to the primary target.  The another day.  Deadly radioactive cargo in her home.  Give me a break.  Bunch of pussies.  Puss.  Puss.  Puss.  Puss.  Un-effing believable.  They get us in trouble.  They cry.  You guys should hear the crying that goes on when we're not on the air.  They've been picking on us.  We can't handle it.  We don't know what to say back, so you've got to make them stir. 
[02:41:30]  Look how fast we forgot about this class.  The boss, Jeremy.  Here he is.  Jeremy.  Jeremy spoken.  Okay.  Did you hear what just went on?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  Yes, I did.  And I'm already on it, and I have a feeling this is going to end with people being fired.  Let them know.  People are going to get fired?  I have a feeling.  Oh, good.  I have a feeling.  Because we have been told, we have been on the brink of firing when this started.  We have been given a set of rules, which I think we have adhered to.  That is correct.  And they have, on time and time again, just broken these rules. 
[02:42:00]  It's a double standard.  It's ridiculous.  But, like we said, if we can go to war, I would be totally fine with that, happy with it.  We would love that, actually.  Or it could be handled through your end of it, through your channel.  Well, hold off on the war for right now.  Okay.  Don't put the cover too heavily over it.  You're not like those damn Jap ambassadors they sent to Washington while they were bombing Pearl Harbor, are you?  Now we all hang back, all cool and stuff, and our boys on the Arizona are in flames. 
[02:42:30]  No, I promise you, the boys on the Arizona are safe.  You're not French, are you?  Tora! Tora! Tora!  Yeah, you're not French either, right?  No.  Hey.  Okay, we all know how quickly they turn.  I'm helping you here.  Hitler, it is yells.  Look at the listeners.  Can I make you a clip while you march on our campaign?  Look at the listeners are begging, please send out the troops, give the word, and I'll go to war.  We have fighters on this show.  We have the biggest army in this whole damn city.  They think it's all cute to do this? 
[02:43:00]  I swear to God, we can unleash a maelstrom.  Ernie, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, man?  Not much.  I just want to say, man, I'm on Madison Avenue.  You give the word, and I'm there.  See, they just dumped out.  See?  Look at that.  Thank you, Ernie.  All right, man.  Have a good one, fellas.  Keep it real.  See, that's exactly what happens with our show.  So we're going by the rules.  Uh-huh.  All right, so it's being handled through diplomatic channels?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll give you a full report tomorrow morning. 
[02:43:30]  Thank you.  Colonel Jeremy.  We're more concerned about this than Spaz being arrested, by the way.  Spaz being arrested is nothing.  So I'm understanding the hierarchy of import here.  Oh, yeah.  This is of galactic import.  So I should do nothing about Spaz being arrested, then?  No, we'll take care of it.  I think we got bail money.  You should recall Ian all again.  All right, there goes Jeremy spoken.  Stand down.  Stand down.  Return to base.  Disarm the bomb for now. 
[02:44:00]  Real cocky, real smart.  Till tomorrow.  That was cute.  Cute move.  You don't have balls like N.I.  N.I.  N.I.  We'll put our jobs on the line right this second.  We've done it before.  We'll do it.  We don't care.  I love L.A.  I'll go there.  It's warm.  Where's Chicago and Florida?  This is the crap we have to put up with all the time.  Sneaky bastards.  We get in so much trouble.  The second we do something, I swear to God, people cannot imagine the management that 
[02:44:30]  comes down on our asses from various stations, not just our own management.  Right.  The second we do something, the second people think we're going to do something.  How about that fiasco?  We have, yeah, we have management from other stations that are listening to us right now.  We've been banned from things that have nothing to do with radio.  It doesn't matter if there's even the inkling of a threat by us.  We get screwed.  And they could pull that kind of crap?  Goodbye. 
[02:45:00]  Goodbye.  And don't be confused here.  Ed and I are not wimps.  I would love to battle.  We'll battle.  We've never lost a battle.  I am so confident in our troops out there in the field, I would have no problem totally  pulling the stops out.  If we lost or ended up getting the boot, so be it.  All right.  We're very pissed off.  And there's a girl outside that wants to wow us.  That might comment.  Oh, that all of a sudden got top priority.  Look at that.  Spaz is now in third place.  The Enola Gay is second.  And Boobs first. 
[02:45:30]  Let's see the nose cone of Little Man.  Oh, hey.  All right.  What do we got?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I'm okay.  Are you, like, 18 at least?  Yes.  How old are you?  18.  Got it.  All right.  Now we've dumped out eight seconds.  We just dumped out a lot of the show.  That's a curse word.  You're actually the girl that got pushed around by this other radio station.  By this other man. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, okay.  Oh, man.  We even have a little girl, too.  We even have a witness.  Mm-hmm.  Right here.  Oh, ponderous.  Virgin.  Well, we don't know that, Scott.  So...  Come in.  Come in.  You're 18?  Who's that?  Oh, dude.  You've got to leave the studio, man.  Let us have some fun with your girl for a while.  You do whatever you want.  She's my ticket in here.  We haven't seen an 18-year-old girl's body in...  Oh, thank God. 
[02:46:30]  I'm just messing with you.  Man.  Wow.  You weren't even born when I started radio.  Oh, Jesus.  That's pretty sad.  And I'm not even that old, but...  All right.  Let's...  You're going to show us?  A little wowage?  Hey, that's stockbroker Dave right next to you.  Yeah.  Hello.  I'm good.  She's frightened.  Are you frightened?  I'm kidding.  Jesus.  And what's your name?  Allegra.  Allegra.  Are we going to hook up Allegra with a ton of stuff?  She was harassed by that other station. 
[02:47:00]  You're like the peacekeeping force coming in now, you know?  Watch.  You'll be able to calm us right down.  Yeah, that works.  Believe me, it works.  All right.  We're ready.  Okay.  Yeah, let's see.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Bravo.  Bravo.  See what comes out of your mouth right away?  Wow.  That's nice.  Wow.  That's good.  You know what that's like?  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Like a snare drum.  What are you doing over there? 
[02:47:30]  What are you doing?  Wow, look at that.  You can get that in a row.  Thank you.  What?  I broke a date.  Throwing out the cash.  So, are you happy now?  Happier?  We're much happier.  Yeah, much happier.  I believe if we see your backside, I'll really be calming.  You're kidding.  Well, look what's coming at you right there.  Oh, my God.  Who's that noise from?  I am not.  No.  Huh?  Okay.  Let's just put it this way. 
[02:48:00]  What would you do for $100?  Oh.  Oh, no.  We're not playing Allegra's a hoe, are we?  No, we're not playing Allegra's a hoe.  I hope you're insulting me.  I'm just asking.  What would you do for $100?  It doesn't have to be sexual.  It was just asking a question.  Anthony, right?  No.  Is the boyfriend pissed off?  I'm not pissed at all.  Okay.  Can we play what's in your pants?  That's a good one.  Okay.  Okay.  Studio mic.  Okay.  All right.  We need some kind of cell phone or something. 
[02:48:30]  No, use one of the in-studio microphones.  Mark studio.  No, we wanted her to do it under the console or something right in here.  Microphone.  Yeah, right there.  All right.  All right.  That's good, Ant.  Why don't you set this up, Ant?  Wait, we got a guy that wants to pull a kamikaze mission.  Bob, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Bob.  I serve at the pleasure of Opie and Anthony.  I regret that I have but one life to give.  Say the word. 
[02:49:00]  I'm your faithful servant.  Bob, we appreciate it.  It's not mine to ask why.  It is mine to serve and die.  We really appreciate it.  There is such a double standard going on here.  It's not even funny.  We're more than willing to fight with whoever wants to fight us.  But we're not allowed to.  And these other people get to do whatever they want to our show.  Yeah.  No, it's not right.  Thank you, Bob.  We're not scared of anyone.  We'll fight anyone in this damn town.  And then they get to pull up with their van with a megaphone and try to disrupt something we're doing. 
[02:49:30]  Can I just make a statement?  Yeah.  There's a naked girl in the studio.  Who cares?  Where is she?  Well, I'm waiting.  Where did Mark take her?  Why did Mark take her somewhere else?  Why?  Why did...  Mark!  I'll bring her right back.  What are you...  You idiot.  I don't know.  What are you not?  It's not like she's calling from Jersey.  She's right here.  We don't need to play the phone game.  Let's get her in here.  She wants to do it on the phone.  She doesn't want to do it in the studio.  That's the only thing.  Oh, really? 
[02:50:00]  Well, that's how you play the game.  Ask her if she'll do it in the studio for, uh...  200?  You want to do it in the studio for 200?  Say yes, Allegra.  Please say yes.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  She'll come in.  All right.  There you go.  There we go.  Nice.  Never done this with the acoustics of a microphone.  We're used to hearing the sounds of the cell phone.  All right.  Here comes Allegra.  Take the mic.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  All right.  Listen.  Okay. 
[02:50:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  We'll talk her through this.  Yeah.  Psycho Mark, you're like a damn rapist.  You know, there's no tag.  There's got to be a coot to this.  Uh, Larry, what's going on?  Uh, yo, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Today, that pud even said that he was going to do something against you guys.  He said that when he first came on the air, that he was going to do something to plagiarize  another radio station and a quote-unquote another radio show.  Well, we'll find out.  Have fun.  All right.  Let us know.  We'll get him. 
[02:51:00]  That pud may be out of a job.  People will get fired over this.  Either that or they have to allow us to fight.  That's it.  Simple as that.  One way or the other.  You either fire someone or, or, you know, take off the cuffs and let us fight.  One way or the other.  We've been behaving.  We did everything the company told us to do.  But more importantly, back to what's in your pants.  Okay.  Allegra?  Yes.  All right.  You ready to play?  Yes.  What kind of panties you got on?  Oh, boy.  You're going to hate me, Cotton.  No, the Victoria's Secret.  Victoria's Secret, uh, Cotton? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah?  Let's take a look-see.  In front of her boyfriend stuff, though?  No, I'm not paying attention to him.  All right.  Go ahead.  No, those are pretty good.  Wow, those are nice.  Yeah.  All right.  They do the job.  All right.  So, you know how to play What's in My Pants?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  It's got to be on bear, uh, you know, whatever.  We're going to use the microphone.  Make sure Fez uses that microphone today.  Maybe we'll, uh...  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[02:52:00]  He'll be scared straight.  It's unbelievable.  All right.  Well, you guys can't...  I mean...  If you're going to guess, you can't...  Huh?  All right, Dave.  You going to play, Dave?  All right.  Get on this side of the console.  We can't look.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Everyone get on this side of the console.  You're not guessing anything.  You have to guess.  Okay.  I'm blindfolded.  All right.  Well, I got my blinders on.  All right.  Allegra?  Yeah.  Okay.  No, I can't see from here. 
[02:52:30]  I swear.  All right.  All right.  So, uh, tell us what you're doing.  Her panties are down.  Little 18-year-old young thing.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  She's rubbing.  Oh, okay.  And now back and forth, if you would.  Wait.  Someone mic her.  Joe, get your mic.  Give her...  Joe, give her...  Joe, give...  Joe, you ass.  Give her that mic.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  You won't look okay.  All right.  So, let's start over.  Okay.  You're obviously, uh, whatever.  You have...  Okay.  All right.  Take the microphone and go in a, uh, up and down motion.  Okay.  All right.  Now, uh, side to side.  Side to side.  Okay.  I got it.  Uh, well, wait.  This is too good, though.  I can't do an in-and-out motion now.  Ah, Stockbroker Day.  In a, uh, circular motion, if you will. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Damn.  All right.  All right.  Um, Stockbroker Day, it's to you.  All right.  I'm pulling up here.  All right.  You can...  Okay.  There we go.  I'm going with the wood floor.  Wood floor for Stockbroker Day.  Wood floor.  Fresh wood floor.  Okay.  Lopey, your guess?  Uh, triangle.  Okay.  Finally groomed.  Uh, I am going to say, yeah, natural triangle with a lovely tattoo of right above it.  Oh, my God. 
[02:54:00]  Well, I could tell by the sound on the, uh...  What's the tattoo of right?  It's half a heart.  Why...  I don't know if you can see it.  Why only half a heart?  Because he has the other half.  Your boyfriend has the other half?  That's devotion.  That is devotion.  Can I see your half?  Oh, what?  No, I'm still looking at the chick.  Relax.  Oh, I thought I was talking a half.  That's cool.  You scared the Jesus out of me right there.  All right.  And what did you say? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, I said a triangle.  You saw it?  Of course.  If you had an open line of sight, you'd look too.  Of course.  What kind of triangle?  Is it well-groomed or...?  It is actually more like a square.  You know, nobody let me guess.  Uh-uh.  I was being honest.  I had my blinders on.  And I was...  Wait, give me a second.  Oh, gee.  So...  No, I was going to say a mohawk.  Stick to song, Paris.  I was going to say a mohawk.  Mohawk?  It's not a mohawk. 
[02:55:00]  It's closest to that.  It's like a square.  Ah-ha.  No.  Okay.  Thank you.  I wouldn't say that.  Yes.  I heard...  She's telling you.  Let me see.  Prove it.  She's on both sides.  She's on both sides.  No, what?  Let me see.  Yeah, let's see.  Let me see.  I can't agree with that.  I can't agree with that.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  That's a triangle, though.  No.  Thank you.  Who wins?  That's a mohawk.  I think he wins.  Look at this.  I get no support.  Very cute.  What else can we do? 
[02:55:30]  I can't agree with that.  And I didn't look.  And he was right.  All right.  Ta-da.  That's two to two.  I don't think so.  I think it's a triangle.  I think it's a well-groomed try.  Who cares?  Very nice.  That rocks.  That definitely rocks.  All right.  Ben, hook her up with some prizes. 
[02:56:00]  Phil, what's going on?  Phil?  Yo, what's up, man?  You're on the air, man.  What's up?  Dude, Stan's getting arrested.  It was priceless.  Yeah.  It was around.  Comes around.  Did you see him get arrested?  Oh, no.  I heard it on the radio.  It was priceless.  Ben!  I know.  When he screamed out, Ben!  Yeah, no.  That was hilarious.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you, Phil.  Yo, dude.  Yeah.  I got you like spreading all over the United States.  Well, we appreciate that.  You know that, Phil.  Syndication underground, man.  Yeah.  You guys rule. 
[02:56:30]  Thank you.  No problem.  Bye.  Psycho Mark, stop smelling the microphone.  Dude, this is another girl that wants to play what's in my pants.  Oh, really?  Who's this other girl?  I don't know, but she's hot!  Psycho Mark, you're insane.  That's a guy.  Whoa.  That's a girl!  Oh, I see the girl.  Yeah.  No, Steve.  Yeah, I bet Psycho Mark's definitely gay.  Hi.  What's your name?  Janice.  Janice?  Janice?  Hi.  How you doing? 
[02:57:00]  Well, we kind of have to take a break.  First of all, who's the guy with you?  What's the boyfriend?  Oh, it's the boyfriends now coming in.  Remember, they used to be the...  I'm glad to provide a speech.  Were you guys outside, too, for the whole mess?  No, we just got here.  All right, cool.  It's a three-war USO show.  All right, Dan, let's take a quick break, okay?  All right, man.  We'll take a quick break, and we will be back.  Stay right there.  All right, it's the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[02:57:30]  Another wild day today, huh, Ant?  Hell yeah.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  Jeremy's taking notes from the witness, Anthony.  Yeah, the girl that was roughed up.  Roughed up by another station that has been told to not mess with us.  As we have been told not to mess with them.  And we have kept the truce, as it were. 
[02:58:00]  Because they don't want to...  Believe me, they don't want to battle with our listeners.  Don't be confused.  We're not the pussies.  We're not the ones that ran for the bosses crying and screaming and stuff.  We would love to pull all the stops out and just, like, go BS on them.  Because I get a sick pleasure in knowing that if we were able to do what we wanted to do,  they could not even go out in public.  Believe me. 
[02:58:30]  It would get that ugly.  But, yeah, we listen.  We concentrate on our show.  That's all.  Well, Jeremy's running around.  He's trying to handle the situation behind the scenes, Anthony.  Colonel Jeremy.  We'll see how he handles this one.  We're just trying to do another entertaining radio show.  Has General Ken been informed, up to speed on this?  Yes, he has, Anthony.  Good. 
[02:59:00]  Such double standards.  Yesterday, they're playing one of our bits on their station.  Yeah.  And now, today, they're driving by in their van with megaphone harassing.  Not driving, not getting out of the van and interfering with one of our little projects that we had today.  And roughing up one of our female listeners.  A petite girl.  And we're told we're the problem.  With very nice breasts and a finely trimmed triangle. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  We have another girl that wants to play What's In My Pants, I believe, has today.  All righty.  Where's the wacky What's In My Pants game intro music?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[03:00:00]  How'd you like to blow my roll?  Huh?  I like that.  Okay.  Her name is Janice.  We've taken this What's In My Pants game to the next level.  Now we're doing it live in the studio.  Live in the studio on live microphones.  The mic that Fez will be using tonight on the Ron and Fez show.  Hey, this is something that's not familiar to me.  He's going to be scared straight tonight when he gets a load of what's going on. 
[03:00:30]  Never smelled this before.  Janice, how are you?  Pretty good.  Good.  What's your boyfriend's name?  Leo.  Leo?  Leo.  Leo, you're a short guy.  I like tall women.  And your chick is pretty tall.  Yeah, how tall are you, Leo?  About 5'6", 5'5".  5'5".  Don't cut me down in your lower.  5'4", tops.  Steve, what do you think?  5'4", tops?  And how old is your girl?  Old.  How tall is your girl? 
[03:01:00]  Well, that's a very important question.  Yeah, how old are you?  On our show.  Me?  I'm 23.  23, okay.  And how tall?  I'm about 5'9", 5'10".  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you guys were outside?  Oh, no, you said you just came rushing down to the station, right?  Because you want some of Dave's money.  New game on the show.  Do stuff for Dave.  Win valuable prizes.  What's in Stockbroker Dave's wallet.  What's in Stockbroker Dave's wallet.  That's pretty good.  People are checking in from Rikers. 
[03:01:30]  They're now playing What's in Spaz's Pants.  And the funny thing is, the answer is Bubba.  Well, Jazz, would you like to start with a little wow, you think?  A little shine?  What are you thinking?  I did that earlier today, actually.  Oh, yeah?  So it wasn't Wednesday.  I had so much fun.  No, you couldn't.  Well, it's Whip'em Out Whenever.  It is Whip'em Out Whenever.  That's what the other W is for.  We started slow with Whip'em Out Wednesday, but at this point, it's Whip'em Out Whenever.  Yeah.  All right, let's...  All right.  Here she goes.  You have to impress Dave.  Whoa.  There we go.  Bravo.  Very, very good. 
[03:02:00]  Very nice.  Very nice.  There it is.  What do you do for a living?  Me?  I'm a professional escort.  You are an escort.  Yeah.  Wow, you go out with an escort?  Mm-hmm.  Actually, that's how we met.  Really?  You called her up for a date?  Did I call her?  No, I was actually a driver.  Oh.  So you drive to the place, she does her thing, and then gets back into the car, you drive  her home type thing?  Basically, yeah.  Interesting.  Very interesting. 
[03:02:30]  And you have no problem with what she does?  Wow, she makes like over $1,000 a day cash.  Yo, bro.  No doubt.  You know?  So are you like her pimp?  How can I plug what we got going?  Oh, okay.  I see what it is now.  What, what?  Boyfriend, but how many other girlfriends you got, dude?  No, no, we are boyfriend and girlfriend.  Leo the pimp?  How many you got in your stable, bro?  How many?  So far, two at three right now.  Yeah, okay. 
[03:03:00]  All right.  I understand.  I hear you.  Does he beat you up, Janice?  No.  No?  Never laid a hand on you?  Where my money, bitch?  Where my money?  Only in that.  I'll push.  Where my money, bitch?  None of that?  What a wacky scene we got going on here.  It's a little crazy.  Tell you the truth, it looks like she could kick his ass.  That's true, yeah.  Leo, the 5'4 pimp.  All right.  Pimp hand.  Guido, the killer pimp in the studio. 
[03:03:30]  So, where's the money?  Look at him, look at him.  All right.  If she's a professional, though, I mean, she's not going to get off easy like, I forgot the  girl's name already.  Allegra?  Allegra.  Yeah.  We want to see, you know, what you're...  Hold on.  I best dump out of what Stockbroke Dave just said.  All right.  And I won't repeat it.  You're capable of a lot of things?  Yeah.  We'll give you...  Where is he?  Get Earl in here. 
[03:04:00]  I want no description of what she is doing from anybody else.  Look at him.  Don't worry.  Look at him.  Look at the pimp.  Money.  Money.  Money.  Don't you worry.  Don't you worry, my friend.  Five bullets right here.  You'll get what you're coming.  Five bullets.  I say, yeah.  That's the inventor of electricity right there on the cover of that greenback.  They're over here now.  Over here now. 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  Should we throw Stinky a bone today?  What do you mean?  Oh, like a little...  A little present?  Bachelor party action.  Whatever would be...  Get Stinky in here.  Stinkmeister.  Where are you?  I like the way this sounds already.  Oh, really?  Stinky.  Meet Janice.  Hello.  Hello.  Do you think she's cute? 
[03:05:00]  Think she's cute there, Stinky?  She's very cute.  There you go.  You know she's an escort.  Yes, I think I heard that when she called before.  You know what escorts do, Stinky?  I think I have an idea.  Yeah.  They, like, go out on dates with you, right?  Right.  Dates.  Sure.  That's what you call it.  You get a little...  A date.  You get a little ice cream soda.  Yeah.  You play some...  You go bowling, maybe.  Some night bowling.  Sure.  Or you go to the arcade and play some air hockey on a little date. 
[03:05:30]  And then you get a soda with two...  Well, okay, wait.  Maybe I shouldn't have put that on the air.  I think I got a little too graphic there.  Well, there's a little...  No, or maybe there might be some romance, let's say.  I should have put it more in those terms.  Romance.  Janice, Janice, show Stinky some romance.  Yeah.  Well, look at him.  Where's the money?  Where's the money?  Yeah, this guy will kick your ass.  It may be 5'4", but he knows what's going on. 
[03:06:00]  Janice, show Stinky some romance.  Yeah.  Like how?  I don't know.  Like, uh...  I think we really want to see this.  I'm sure I do.  What is the pimp saying?  How about this?  Guido, the killer pimp.  What's going on?  Leo.  Leo.  Leo, the killer pimp.  How about we throw...  All right, one of those.  I say she should show him some romance, you know? 
[03:06:30]  Well, you show him some romance.  200.  How about one of that?  One of that.  One of those.  And one of these.  And the clothes come off?  At least that?  We get that going?  So far?  Oh, there's plenty more where that came from.  All right.  All right.  You know, we do it in steps.  Hand one of those to Leo, the killer pimp.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah, and then everything comes off.  At least we get a, you know, sea stuff. 
[03:07:00]  That's all.  That's a good deal.  See, we're bargaining.  Obviously, we want more, you know what I mean?  Oh, well.  Pimpers are always extra.  Okay, well, let's see what the goods are first before anything starts snapping, you know?  All right.  She's disrobing.  Yeah.  I got a nice little...  She slowly disrobes.  I got to go to the phones real fast.  You keep going over there, Jess.  Dan, what's up?  How you doing?  Good.  I'm downstairs in front of the building again.  Yeah.  I was here before.  Okay.  The van from the truck, from the station I won't mention, they passed by again. 
[03:07:30]  They stopped, pulled up, got out, looked around to see if anything was still going on.  Oh, great.  Well, we're dealing with the situation behind the scenes right now.  Yeah, it's being dealt with.  Thank you.  Jeez, I wanted to kill him.  Nah.  Thank you, Dan.  No, we haven't declared anything, don't you?  Please do.  We're waiting to see how it's handled behind the scenes.  All right.  And you know the game is rolling out in the comments.  Yeah.  Colonel Timberts, hot down.  All right. 
[03:08:00]  Thank you.  All right, man.  Thank you, Dan.  Let's see.  Joe, could you maybe move the mic down?  Okay.  There we go.  That's good.  What's that?  What's going on over here?  She's covering up.  She's taking the top off.  Yeah.  She's a shy escort, aren't you?  You're a little shy.  Sometimes.  She's got a hunk of the bow.  Well, that's okay.  She's got a hunk of bow stuck to her nose, too.  Just thinking.  There you go.  You got it.  All right.  She did.  She had, like, a thing hanging there. 
[03:08:30]  I don't know what that was.  Okay.  Yeah, what was that?  There was a piece of feather.  Oh, a feather boa.  I thought you said a booger.  I was like, wow, that would really ruin the moment.  You got a booger stuck to you.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Tell stockbroker Dave, keep handing them out.  Everything could come off.  Yeah.  No.  It was a hundred bucks for naked.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Dave said that ain't naked.  Yeah.  Give him some more, Dave.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Don't worry.  When this all ends, we're mutually all going to be very happy. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  You'll be happy as a businessman.  We'll be happy as a room full of horny ass wipes.  Don't you worry.  All right.  Yeah, Stinky.  Help around, man.  Yeah, Stinky.  Come on.  What the hell?  Get down there.  Oh, God, this is so wrong.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Okay.  Terrific.  All right.  Now, what do we got there?  Yeah, pull that off.  Yes.  She's taking off her skirt thingy.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  There it goes, coming off.  All right.  What are you wearing there?  That's some kind of a thong thingy, right?  Mm-hmm.  Let me see the back of that.  All right.  All right.  Okay, terrific.  That's not naked.  Yeah.  Naked.  Naked.  Naked.  All right.  All right.  Like I said, we'll all be happy when this is over.  Very nice.  Let's see.  There we go. 
[03:10:00]  Look at her.  She's all shy.  How can an escort be shy?  I don't get it.  Should we show her another one or what?  You ever do a bachelor party or something?  You ever do that?  A couple times.  Yeah, that's a lot of guys, right?  Yeah.  And just think there's no drunks that are going to...  But it's usually another girl involved.  You know, the two-girl thing.  Oh, this is good.  You don't have to split anything.  She already left.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Now, what was next?  We were going to do some kind of show, right?  The money. 
[03:10:30]  The money.  All right.  Ah, the money.  The money's next.  And screw Spaz's bail money, man.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We're using Spaz's bail money.  This is terrible.  Spaz is sitting somewhere in a jail, and his money's being used for an escort.  It's a sad day.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Well, do we have anything, any extracurricular things? 
[03:11:00]  Stockbroker Dave.  Coke bottle.  Coke bottle.  Let's ask Leo.  Fatty Arbuckle.  Calm down.  Let's negotiate with Leo, the killer pimp.  All right.  Leo?  Yeah.  You know Benjamin Franklin, don't you?  Right?  Of course.  Probably a good friend of yours.  Very good friend.  How many times would you need to see Ben Franklin to do a magic trick?  Now, the magic trick would be the incredible disappearing Coke bottle. 
[03:11:30]  Hmm.  You say another 200 would do?  I don't know what the 100 thing is, but I'm talking baseball cards.  There's pictures of Benjamin Franklin on him.  Benjamin Franklin, huh?  Okay.  Stockbroker Dave?  I'm speaking with you.  Oh, jeez.  No, that...  We'll bottle and the pig.  Deal? 
[03:12:00]  Deal.  Way to go, Leo.  Deal.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute, man.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Let's see what happens here.  Keep it in plain sight.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, jeez.  There we go.  Okay.  This is...  This is wonderful.  Yes.  There it is.  She's like a Coke...  Like Doug Henning.  A Coke dispenser. 
[03:12:30]  If you will.  Okay.  Zigfried and Roy.  Just like a magic...  Wow.  What the hell is that?  Yeah.  Wow.  Whoa.  All right.  Very much.  Wow.  Look at that.  It's...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Well, yeah.  Coke and a smile.  Can you pick it up with that?  Wow.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Dave, you've got to charge your next trip on those drinks. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, come on.  Wow.  That's very nice.  What are you going to do with that?  It's a big, huge foam finger.  It's...  It's kind of, uh...  Like, um...  Limp.  It's something better.  Yeah, something better than that.  Someone pass me my Coke.  Oh.  No one.  We didn't have anything in the office? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, one of those?  Can we get it?  Yeah, go get that thing.  Uh, Tom, what's going on?  Look at the thing.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  Dude, I've been listening to the radio for five hours now listening to this.  Train wreck radio at its best.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all over the place today, aren't we?  Oh, my God.  From spaz getting arrested to disappearing Coke bottles.  What are you guys going to do next?  It's a magic trick, is all it is. 
[03:14:00]  I'm dying over here.  I'm dying over here.  And poor spaz, we're using his bail money.  Oh, my God.  Take care for this.  You should get tooled.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  Oh.  All right.  Wow.  Well, we've had a lot of fun once again today, huh?  Oh, look at the time.  I know.  Boy, that last hour flew.  Yeah, we've got to get out of here.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Did they find anything for the finale? 
[03:14:30]  I'm going to have to do this off the air.  I think we might have to do this off the air.  Yeah, we can't be late again today after yesterday's fiasco.  Are we ever going to resolve that issue from the end of yesterday's show with our producer at any point?  He's not talking to anyone.  We're getting a lot of instant feedback, some phone calls, people curious about what goes on.  He's not talking to anyone about it.  Okay.  Well, maybe tomorrow.  202 there. 
[03:15:00]  Bail money.  Spaz is frigging bail.  You're going to need that.  Oh, my God.  What are we waiting for?  Stinky is looking for the thing.  Ah, the thing.  The thing from the office.  Andrew, what's going on?  Yeah, I wrote a couple of things on the open-air of the show today.  Yeah.  I wrote that there are a couple of ways to call for distress.  Number one, saying gun.  And there's a two-second, help me, help me.  After, I have to bring out a new syndication line. 
[03:15:30]  It's a syndication when Ralph Paolo died, but it's a syndication on the ground.  All right.  Thank you, Andrew.  I have no clue what you said, but thank you.  He's calling from deep below the Earth's crust.  And this just coming in, I believe we have audio of Spaz when he was being taken away in the cop car.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm looking for that.  Let me hit the tape over here.  Oh, no.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Oh, Lordy, Lord. 
[03:16:00]  He's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  You guys cannot use my wiffle ball back.  Oh, wait a minute.  Spaz from the jail.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Anthony, Spaz on the line.  Spaz, where are you?  I'm over here now.  That poor bastard.  Oh, wait a minute.  I think that's him on the phone. 
[03:16:30]  He's meeting new friends.  Spaz, you there?  Anthony?  Come on!  Yeah?  Spaz, how are you doing in the joint?  Joint chair!  It's torture!  All right, you guys cannot use my wiffle ball bat. 
[03:17:00]  Come on.  I have to put my foot down.  We'll get a new one.  It's our wiffle ball bat.  We play wiffle ball in the...  Something could go on top of that, you know?  Yeah.  Mike?  Like a spare tire or something, you know?  Oh, you got that?  You got one of those?  There we go.  Hey, one of those with the bat.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Put it over the bat.  All right, you can do that.  Dude, you go down to Dwayne Reed, you buy yourself a new little wiffle ball bat and some Hot Wheels cars and whatever else you need. 
[03:17:30]  But it's my wiffle ball bat.  You're going to hold us back from seeing this?  All right.  Okay.  How far?  This is worse than the pine tar incident.  Remember that?  I could use that bat to pick sides for a team, Anthony.  I'll guess...  Now stepping up to the plate, she has an unusual stance at the plate.  Quite the grip on that bat.  Someone get a Sharpie. 
[03:18:00]  Why?  Because we want to mark, you know, we want to mark...  Oh, okay, yeah.  Here, give it...  And then we'll see, uh...  Hey, we've got to auction that off.  Yeah, give it...  We've got so many things to auction off these days.  Stinky, your new job, your job today is to mark the bat where, you know, it, like...  Yeah, I think he totally understands without saying that.  All right.  Let's see.  Okay.  This is the grand finale of the show, I guess, Anthony.  All right.  What a train wreck it was today. 
[03:18:30]  Janice, whenever you're ready.  Whenever you're ready.  There she goes.  Okay.  Wow, she's rounding third and heading for home.  All right.  Is that it?  She can't speak.  She's choking.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's see.  It's like the world's smallest portable chair.  You ever ride a bicycle without the seat?  There you go. 
[03:19:00]  Mark it, Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky's marking the bat.  Okay.  Stinky, in some countries you would be married.  Oh, my God.  That bat's not going to need pine tar.  No, definitely not.  For a little grip.  She's trying to break the record.  She's trying to break her own record.  She wants to break the record.  There we go.  Athletic competition at its best.  That's a nice grip.  Did she break the record? 
[03:19:30]  No.  No, huh?  That's okay.  Very good.  Well, that ain't bad.  That's stinky.  That's wonderful.  We'll have that put in a sealed evidence envelope, and we'll, um...  Huh?  Plug?  Plug?  I think she just did.  You need a plug?  What are you nuts?  Just a quick one.  Yeah, go ahead.  Plug.  Enticing Escort.  732-682-5250.  All right.  Leo.  The finest.  Only the finest.  Leo, the killer pimp.  Opie, this has been a bang-up show. 
[03:20:00]  It's another award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  We're at the brink of war.  Our own spaz is imprisoned, and we've had a girl do things on the radio that we can't  even talk about.  Fantastic.  We are at the brink of war, yes.  What a day.  Yes.  732-682-5250.  All right, Leo, the killer pimp.  All right, man.  Leo, everyone.  Okay, we've got to get out of here.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day. 
[03:20:30]  All right, Stockbroker Dave, thanks for coming by.  Thanks, man.  Were you happy with the results?  Win Stockbroker Dave's money.  Yes.  I can't believe what she did.  Stockbroker Dave's going to take his money and give it to her, and I can't even tell you  what she's going to do.  Win Dave's money.  Would you like to come in every once in a while and play Win Dave's Money? 
[03:21:00]  I'd love to do that.  All right.  I'm sure we'll get some contestants.  All right, Ant, let's get the hell out of here.  Yeah, please.  Thanks for listening to this mess, and it was a mess today.  We were very, very tired.  Who's picking up Spaz over at the tombs?  He's going to have to stay overnight.  He's got to stay overnight.  We've still got to figure that out.  We'll be back tomorrow, too, okay?  As we leave you, we're at the brink of war.  Yeah.  Tune in tomorrow to see what happens.  About a day on stand-down, but on the tarmac. 
[03:21:30]  Colonel Gibbets and his crew on full alert.  The deadly cargo in her belly.  There you go.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, too.  Thanks.  Hey, Ant, your mom did say I was hot.  Oh, come on, Mom.  Don't bang Opie.  You're my mom.  I'm yours.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it.  It's a hell of a toboggan ride. 
[03:22:00]  Opie, okay.  A couple of real motherfuckers.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
